The 2-door [[coup\u00e9]] versions of the 1000 MB and 1100 MB were called the '''1000 MBX''' and '''1100 MBX'''.\n\n== New layout introduction ==\nIn 1955, the same year in which the [[\u0160koda 440/445]] made its first appearance, \u0160koda started making plans for a new car for the 1960s. The initial plans for the car were to make the car as light and fuel-efficient as possible: it was to weigh no more than 700 [[kilogram|kg]], and the overall fuel consumption was not to exceed 6-7 litres per 100 kilometres (33-38mpg).\n\nThe next step was to produce the car as a four-door saloon, which would be built using [[monocoque]] construction. Like most leading car manufacturers dating from before the [[World War II|Second World War]], \u0160koda always built their cars using the traditional and well-proven front-engine and rear-wheel drive layout.\n\nThe ''front-engined-with-front-wheel-drive'' option was unsuccessful due higher cost and design complexity, and therefore \u0160koda opted for the rear-engined-with-rear-wheel-drive format. Even by the early 1960s, the idea of rear-engined small family saloons was still considered to be reasonably popular. In France, there were the [[Renault Dauphine]], [[Renault 8]] and [[Simca 1000]], while in Germany there were the [[Volkswagen Beetle]] and [[NSU Prinz]], in Italy there were the Fiats [[Fiat 500|500]] and [[Fiat 600|600]], and in Britain there was the [[Hillman Imp]], all of which employed the rear-engined concept.\n\n== A new era for \u0160koda ==\nThe '''\u0160koda 1000 MB''' (the letters \u2018MB\u2019 coming from the initials of Mlad\u00e1 Boleslav) made its debut in April 1964, as the successor for the [[\u0160koda Octavia (1959-1971)|\u0160koda Octavia]]. This was just the beginning of what was to eventually evolve into a long line of rear-engined \u0160kodas. The engine that powered the 1000 MB was a 988cc (1-litre), 4-cylinder, overhead valve (OHV) unit that produced {{convert|44|bhp|kW|0|abbr=on}}. It was water-cooled, with an aluminum cylinder block and cast iron cylinder head. The 1000 MB had a four-speed manual all-synchromesh gearbox, all-round independent suspension, swing axle rear suspension, and drum brakes at the front and rear.\n\nThe 1000 MB was a stylish four-door saloon (measuring 13 feet 8 inches in length and 5 feet 4 inches in width, with a wheelbase of 7 feet 10 inches), which featured a steeply sloping nose that was flanked by rounded front wings (not unlike the [[Ford Anglia#Anglia 105E (1959-68)|Ford Anglia 105E]] of the time). Being a rear-engined car, the 1000 MB's radiator and (engine-driven) cooling fan were situated in the rear engine compartment, so therefore a series of slats were cut into each rear wing and the rear panel to increase the flow rate of air in order to assist in keeping the engine cool. Apart from the use of cooling vents in the rear wings and rear panel, everything else about the 1000 MB's styling was normal, which was undoubtedly in an attempt to appeal to all the conservative-minded buyers in export countries like the UK. This car was highly successful both for \u0160koda and the Czech economy.\n\nBy early 1965, the British were starting to receive the 1000 MB, which was being priced at a reasonable \u00a3579, which worked out cheaper than similarly-sized four-door saloons like the [[Ford Cortina|Ford Cortina 1200]] (at \u00a3592) and the [[Hillman Minx|Hillman Minx Deluxe]] (at \u00a3636). Despite being affordably priced, the 1000 MB was well equipped, with reclining front seats, a heater and demister, full tool kit, and a generously sized boot up front as well as a useful storage area behind the split/folding rear seat. Many salesman rightly stated over the years that the 1000 MB was \u201ca lot of car for the money.\u201d\n\nThe 1000 MB's overall performance was acceptable, especially when you remember how small an engine it had for a car of its size (as mentioned, a 1-litre engine in a car 13 feet 8 inches long by 5 feet 3 inches wide). The top speed was 120&nbsp;km/h (75&nbsp;mph), reaching 100&nbsp;km/h (62&nbsp;mph) from standstill in 27 seconds. Overall fuel economy was around 36 miles per gallon (6.5 litres per 100&nbsp;km).\n\nBy the late 1960s, \u0160koda felt it was time for an update of the \u2018MB series, which they did with the introduction of the [[\u0160koda 100]] and [[\u0160koda 100|\u0160koda 110]] in August 1969. By the time it was updated, a total of 443,141 \u2018MBs were built. The \u2018MBX series was produced in very limited numbers (2,517 in total) and is therefore an extreme rarity these days.\n\n== Production figures ==\n{| class=\"wikitable\" align=center\n!'''Model'''||'''Production years'''||'''Units made <ref name=\"CN\">{{cite book| last1  = Cedrych| first1 = Mario| last2  = Nachtmann| first2 = Luk\u00e1\u0161| title = \u0160koda: auta zn\u00e1m\u00e1 i nezn\u00e1m\u00e1| publisher = Grada Publishing a.s.| year = 2007| page = 164| ISBN = 978-80-247-1719-7}}</ref>'''\n|-\n|\u0160koda 1000 MB||1964\u20131969||349,348\n|-\n|\u0160koda 1000 MB de Luxe||1966\u20131969||65,502\n|-\n|\u0160koda 1000 MBG de Luxe||1966\u20131969||3,287\n|-\n|\u0160koda 1000 MBX de Luxe||1966\u20131969||1,403\n|-\n|\u0160koda 1100 MB de Luxe||1967\u20131969||22,487\n|-\n|\u0160koda 1100 MBX de Luxe||1967\u20131969||1,114\n|-\n|}\n\n== 'MB series timeline ==\n*April 2, 1964 - Introduction of the '''1000 MB''' (Type 990) four-door saloon.

The Lepidoptera: Form, function and diversity. Oxford, UK: Oxford University Press; 404 p.</ref>\n\nAlthough the rules for distinguishing moths from butterflies are not well established, one very good guiding principle is that butterflies have thin antennae and (with the exception of the family [[Hedylidae]]) have small balls or clubs at the end of their antennae. Moth antennae are usually feathery with no ball on the end. The divisions are named by this principle: \"club-antennae\" (Rhopalocera) or \"varied-antennae\" (Heterocera).\n\n== Etymology ==\n\nThe [[modern English]] word \"moth\" comes from [[Old English]] \"''mo\u00f0\u00f0e''\" (cf. Northumbrian \"''moh\u00f0e''\") from [[Common Germanic]] (compare [[Old Norse]] \"''motti''\", [[Dutch language|Dutch]] \"''mot''\", and [[German language|German]] \"''Motte''\" all meaning \"moth\"). Its origins are possibly related to the Old English \"''ma\u00f0a''\" meaning \"[[maggot]]\" or from the root of \"[[midge]]\" which until the 16th century was used mostly to indicate the [[larva]], usually in reference to devouring clothes.\n\n== Caterpillar ==\n\n[[File:Poplar hawk-moth.jpg|thumb|left|200px|[[Laothoe populi|Poplar hawk-moth caterpillar]] (''Laothoe populi'')]]\n\nMoth larvae, or [[caterpillar]]s, make [[Cocoon (silk)|cocoon]]s from which they emerge as fully grown moths with wings.

Both types of Lepidoptera are thought to have evolved along with [[flowering plants]], mainly because most modern species feed on flowering plants, both as adults and larvae. One of the earliest species thought to be a moth-ancestor is [[Archaeolepis|''Archaeolepis mane'']], whose fossil fragments show scaled wings similar to [[caddisflies]] in their veining.<ref>Chihuahuan Desert Nature Center<br/>\n[http://cdri.org/publications/nature-notes/evolution-ecology/evolution-of-moths-and-butterflies/ Evolution of Moths and Butterflies] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140106184057/http://cdri.org/publications/nature-notes/evolution-ecology/evolution-of-moths-and-butterflies/ |date=2014-01-06 }}<br/>\nStudying the evolution of butterflies and moths is challenging, since fossils are so rare. But the few Lepidopteran fossils that exist, captured in amber or compressed in fine-grained rocks, show great detail. The earliest Lepidopteran fossils appear in rocks that are about 190 million years old. These tiny fragments of scaled wings and bodies clearly indicate that moths evolved before butterflies.</ref>\n[[File:Moth kerala.jpg|thumb|Moth from Kerala, India]]\n\n== Economics ==\n\n=== Significance to humans ===\n\n[[File:Moth September 2008-3.jpg|thumb|200px|An adult male pine processionary moth (''[[Thaumetopoea pityocampa]]'').

Many attempts have been made to group the superfamilies of the Lepidoptera into natural groups, most of which fail because one of the two groups is not monophyletic: [[Microlepidoptera]] and [[Macrolepidoptera]], [[Heterocera]] and [[Rhopalocera]], [[Jugatae]] and [[Frenatae]], [[Monotrysia]] and [[Ditrysia]].<ref name=\"scoble\">Scoble, MJ 1995. The Lepidoptera: Form, function and diversity. Oxford, UK: Oxford University Press; 404 p.</ref>\n\nAlthough the rules for distinguishing moths from butterflies are not well established, one very good guiding principle is that butterflies have thin antennae and (with the exception of the family [[Hedylidae]]) have small balls or clubs at the end of their antennae. Moth antennae are usually feathery with no ball on the end. The divisions are named by this principle: \"club-antennae\" (Rhopalocera) or \"varied-antennae\" (Heterocera).\n\n== Etymology ==\n\nThe [[modern English]] word \"moth\" comes from [[Old English]] \"''mo\u00f0\u00f0e''\" (cf. Northumbrian \"''moh\u00f0e''\") from [[Common Germanic]] (compare [[Old Norse]] \"''motti''\", [[Dutch language|Dutch]] \"''mot''\", and [[German language|German]] \"''Motte''\" all meaning \"moth\"). Its origins are possibly related to the Old English \"''ma\u00f0a''\" meaning \"[[maggot]]\" or from the root of \"[[midge]]\" which until the 16th century was used mostly to indicate the [[larva]], usually in reference to devouring clothes.\n\n== Caterpillar ==\n\n[[File:Poplar hawk-moth.jpg|thumb|left|200px|[[Laothoe populi|Poplar hawk-moth caterpillar]] (''Laothoe populi'')]]\n\nMoth larvae, or [[caterpillar]]s, make [[Cocoon (silk)|cocoon]]s from which they emerge as fully grown moths with wings. Some moth caterpillars dig holes in the ground, where they live until they are ready to turn into adult moths.<ref>{{Cite book | last = Darby | first = Gene | title = What is a Butterfly | publisher = [[Benefic Press]] | location = Chicago | year = 1958 | page = 41 }}</ref> [[File:Moth larva a1 from india kerala idukki mooamattom by gokul maliyakal.jpg|thumb|Moth larva from India]]\n\n==History==\nMoths evolved long before butterflies, with fossils having been found that may be 190 million years old. Both types of Lepidoptera are thought to have evolved along with [[flowering plants]], mainly because most modern species feed on flowering plants, both as adults and larvae. One of the earliest species thought to be a moth-ancestor is [[Archaeolepis|''Archaeolepis mane'']], whose fossil fragments show scaled wings similar to [[caddisflies]] in their veining.<ref>Chihuahuan Desert Nature Center<br/>\n[http://cdri.org/publications/nature-notes/evolution-ecology/evolution-of-moths-and-butterflies/ Evolution of Moths and Butterflies] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140106184057/http://cdri.org/publications/nature-notes/evolution-ecology/evolution-of-moths-and-butterflies/ |date=2014-01-06 }}<br/>\nStudying the evolution of butterflies and moths is challenging, since fossils are so rare. But the few Lepidopteran fossils that exist, captured in amber or compressed in fine-grained rocks, show great detail. The earliest Lepidopteran fossils appear in rocks that are about 190 million years old. These tiny fragments of scaled wings and bodies clearly indicate that moths evolved before butterflies.</ref>\n[[File:Moth kerala.jpg|thumb|Moth from Kerala, India]]\n\n== Economics ==\n\n=== Significance to humans ===\n\n[[File:Moth September 2008-3.jpg|thumb|200px|An adult male pine processionary moth (''[[Thaumetopoea pityocampa]]'').

The road-going RS200 was the basis for Ford's [[Group B]] [[rally car]] and was designed to comply with [[FIA]] homologation regulations, which required 200 parts kits to be produced and at least one road-legal car to be assembled. It was first displayed to the public at the [[Belfast Motor Show]].\n\n==History==\nFollowing the introduction of the MKIII Escort in 1980, Ford Motorsport set about developing a rear-wheel-drive, turbocharged variant of the vehicle that could be entered into competition in [[Group B]] rally racing, and dubbed the new vehicle the [[Ford Escort RS 1700T|Escort RS 1700T]]. A problem-filled development led Ford to abandon the project in frustration in 1983, leaving them without a new vehicle to enter into Group B. Not wanting to abandon Group B or simply \"write off\" the cost of developing the failed 1700T, executives decided to make use of the lessons learned developing that vehicle in preparing a new, purpose-built rally car. In addition, Ford executives became adamant that the new vehicle would feature all-wheel-drive, an addition they felt would be necessary to allow it to compete properly with all-wheel-drive models from [[Peugeot]] and [[Audi]].\n\n[[File:Ford RS200 - Race Retro 2008 01.jpg|thumb|left|RS200 at the Race Retro 2008]]\nThe new vehicle was a unique design, featuring a plastic-[[fiberglass]] composite body designed by [[Ghia]], a mid-mounted engine and four-wheel drive. The cars were built on behalf of Ford by another company well known for its expertise in producing fibreglass bodies - [[Reliant]]. To aid weight distribution, designers mounted the transmission at the front of the car, which required that power from the mid-mounted engine go first up to the front wheels and then be run back again to the rear, creating a complex drive train setup. The chassis was designed by former [[Formula One]] designer [[Tony Southgate]], and Ford's John Wheeler, a former F1 engineer, aided in early development. A double wishbone suspension setup with twin dampers on all four wheels aided handling and helped give the car what was often regarded as being the best balanced platform of any of the RS200's contemporary competitors. The Ford parts-bin was raided to help give the RS200 a Ford corporate look, for example the front windscreen and rear lights were identical to those of the early [[Ford Sierra|Sierra]] and the doors were cut-down Sierra items; though small parts-bin items like switchgear were also used to save development time and expenses.\n\n[[File:Ford RS200 (3874941131).jpg|thumb|The mid-engined RS200's engine bay and rear suspension]]\nPower came from a {{convert|1803|cc|L CID|1|abbr=on}}, single turbocharged Ford-[[Ford BDA|Cosworth \"BDT]]\" engine producing {{convert|250|hp|0|abbr=on}} in road-going trim, and between {{convert|350|and|450|hp|0|abbr=on}} in racing trim; upgrade kits were available for road-going versions to boost power output to over {{convert|300|hp|0|abbr=on}}. Although the RS had the balance and poise necessary to be competitive, its power-to-weight ratio was poor by comparison, and its engine produced notorious low-RPM lag, making it difficult to drive and ultimately less competitive. Factory driver [[Kalle Grundel]]'s third-place finish at the 1986 [[World Rally Championship|WRC]] Rally of Sweden represented the vehicle's best-ever finish in Group B rallying competition, although the model did see limited success outside of the ultra-competitive Group B class. However, only one event later, at the [[Rally de Portugal]], a Ford RS200 was involved in one of the most dramatic accidents in WRC history, claiming the lives of three spectators and injuring many others.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rallye-info.com/carspecs.asp?car=236 |title=Ford RS200 _ Specifications & History |publisher=Rallye-Info.com |date= |accessdate=2011-03-20}}</ref> Another Ford RS200 was crashed by Swiss Formula One driver [[Marc Surer]] against a tree during the 1986 Hessen-Rallye in Germany, killing his co-driver and friend Michel Wyder instantly.\n\n[[File:SchancheBreitenederMelk1989.jpg|thumb|left|RS200 and [[Audi Quattro S1]] competing in rallycross]]\nThe accident at Rally Portugal set off a chain reaction and the RS200 became obsolete after only one full year of competition as the [[F\u00e9d\u00e9ration Internationale de l'Automobile|FIA]], the governing board, which at the time controlled WRC rally racing, abolished Group B after the 1986 season. For 1987, Ford had planned to introduce an \"Evolution\" variant of the RS200, featuring a development of the BDT engine, called later as [[Cosworth#The BDA series|BDT-E]], displacing {{convert|2137|cc|L CID|1|abbr=on}}, developed by Briton [[Brian Hart]]. Power figures for the engine vary quite a bit from source to source, depending on the mechanical setup e.g. boost levels, power output ranges from as little as {{convert|550|hp|PS kW|0|abbr=on}} to as high as {{convert|815|hp|PS kW|0|abbr=on}}; although most typical output was {{convert|580|hp|PS kW|0|abbr=on}} at 8000 rpm and {{convert|400|lbft|Nm|0|abbr=on}} at 5500 rpm of [[torque]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.supercars.net/blog/1986-ford-rs200-evolution/|website=supercars.net|title=1986 Ford RS200 Evolution|language=en-us|date=March 6, 2016|access-date=June 16, 2018}}</ref> It has been said that the most powerful Evolution models can accelerate from 0 to {{convert|60|mi/h|km/h|abbr=on}} in just over two seconds, depending on gearing. Upgraded brakes and suspension components were part of the package as well. The ban on Group B racing effectively forced the E2 model into stillbirth; however, more than a dozen of them were successfully run from August 1986 'til October 1992 in the [[FIA European Championships for Rallycross Drivers]] events all over Europe, and Norwegian [[:de:Bild:SchancheHansen.jpg|Martin Schanche]] claimed the 1991 European [[rallycross]] title with a [[:de:Bild:SchancheRS200-1992.jpg|Ford RS200 E2]] that produced over {{convert|650|bhp|0|abbr=on}}.\n\n[[File:Ford RS200 001.JPG|thumb|left|Ford RS200 at the Spirit of Rally 2005]]\n\nOne RS200, which found its way into circuit racing, originated as a road car; it was converted to [[IMSA GT Championship|IMSA GTO]] specification powered by a 750+ BHP 2.0 litre turbo BDTE Cosworth Evolution engine.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.preromanbritain.com/gwem/martbean/rs200/imsagto.htm |title=IMSA GTO RS200 |publisher=Preromanbritain.com |accessdate=2011-03-20 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110715112336/http://www.preromanbritain.com/gwem/martbean/rs200/imsagto.htm |archivedate=2011-07-15 }}</ref> Competing against the numerous factory backed teams such as Mazda, Mercury and Nissan, with their newly built spaceframe specials, despite being a privateer, the car never achieved any real success to be a serious contender<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wspr-racing.com/wspr/results/imsa/imsagt1989.html|title=wspr-racing.com|work=wspr-racing.com}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wspr-racing.com/wspr/results/imsa/imsagt1990.html|title=wspr-racing.com|work=wspr-racing.com}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wspr-racing.com/wspr/results/imsa/imsagt1991.html|title=wspr-racing.com|work=wspr-racing.com}}</ref> and was kept by the original owner.

It was also designed by engineers who had extensive backgrounds in motorsports, and the engine had a smooth power delivery and functioned more like a racing car engine, as opposed to every one of the other highly modified production-based engines that Audi, Lancia and Peugeot had in their cars. The other famous Group B cars were all based on front-engined production models- and in both the Lancia Delta S4 and the Peugeot 205 T16's case- hatchbacks, and in the Audi Quattro's case- a luxury coupe. Although the Group B-spec S4 and T16 cars were mid-engined, they still originated as front-engined cars. Lancia's predecessor to the Delta S4- the 037- was also a mid-engined Group B supercar, but it was based on and had originated from Lancia's mid-engined Montecarlo production car.\n\n==Production==\n[[File:RS200 Blue 2.jpg|thumb|A blue production RS200.]]\n[[FIA]] homologation rules for [[Group B]] required the construction of at least 200 road-legal vehicles, and Ford constructed these 200 units with spare parts for another 20+ units put aside for the racing teams. Those chassis and spare parts were later also used to build a couple of non-genuine, so-called ''bitsa'' cars.\n\nA total of 24 of the 200 original cars were reportedly later converted to the so-called \"Evolution\" models, mostly marked by their owners as \"E\" or \"E2\" types. Ford's first intention was to mark the FIA-required 20 \"Evo\" cars as series numbers 201 to 220 but as this was actually not necessary according to the FIA rules they later kept their original series numbers (e.g. 201 = 012, 202 = 146, 203 = 174 et cetera).\n\nThe original bodywork tooling for the Ford RS200 was latterly bought by [[Banham Conversions]], who used it to make a [[kit car]] version based on the [[Austin Maestro]]. Due to being a basic rebody of the Maestro, the Austin-Rover engine ancillaries are actually to be found at the front of the vehicle.\n\n==Specification* (Group B Rally car)==\n[[File:Ford RS200 - Flickr - exfordy (1).jpg|thumb|RS200 driven at the 2010 [[Goodwood Festival of Speed]].]]\n[[File:Sports Car Museum L\u00e1ny - Ford RS 200 (rear).jpg|thumb|The rear of an RS200.]]\n{{Listen\n |filename     =Ford RS200.ogg\n |title        =Ford RS200 at Goodwood\n |type         =sound\n |style        =float:right\n}}\n\n===Engine===\n*[[Longitudinal engine|Longitudinally-mounted]], [[mid-engine, four-wheel-drive layout]]\n*Head/block [[aluminium alloy]]/aluminium alloy\n*[[Straight-4|4 cylinders in line]], [[Nikasil]] integrated liners\n*5 main bearings.

The road-going RS200 was the basis for Ford's [[Group B]] [[rally car]] and was designed to comply with [[FIA]] homologation regulations, which required 200 parts kits to be produced and at least one road-legal car to be assembled. It was first displayed to the public at the Belfast Motor Show.\n\n==History==\nFollowing the introduction of the MKIII Escort in 1980, Ford Motorsport set about developing a rear-wheel-drive, turbocharged variant of the vehicle that could be entered into competition in [[Group B]] rally racing, and dubbed the new vehicle the [[Ford Escort RS 1700T|Escort RS 1700T]]. A problem-filled development led Ford to abandon the project in frustration in 1983, leaving them without a new vehicle to enter into Group B. Not wanting to abandon Group B or simply \"write off\" the cost of developing the failed 1700T, executives decided to make use of the lessons learned developing that vehicle in preparing a new, purpose-built rally car. In addition, Ford executives became adamant that the new vehicle would feature all-wheel-drive, an addition they felt would be necessary to allow it to compete properly with all-wheel-drive models from [[Peugeot]] and [[Audi]].\n\n[[File:Ford RS200 - Race Retro 2008 01.jpg|thumb|left|RS200 at the Race Retro 2008]]\nThe new vehicle was a unique design, featuring a plastic-[[fiberglass]] composite body designed by [[Ghia]], a mid-mounted engine and four-wheel drive. The cars were built on behalf of Ford by another company well known for its expertise in producing fibreglass bodies - [[Reliant]]. To aid weight distribution, designers mounted the transmission at the front of the car, which required that power from the mid-mounted engine go first up to the front wheels and then be run back again to the rear, creating a complex drive train setup. The chassis was designed by former [[Formula One]] designer [[Tony Southgate]], and Ford's John Wheeler, a former F1 engineer, aided in early development. A double wishbone suspension setup with twin dampers on all four wheels aided handling and helped give the car what was often regarded as being the best balanced platform of any of the RS200's contemporary competitors. The Ford parts-bin was raided to help give the RS200 a Ford corporate look, for example the front windscreen and rear lights were identical to those of the early [[Ford Sierra|Sierra]] and the doors were cut-down Sierra items; though small parts-bin items like switchgear were also used to save development time and expenses.\n\n[[File:Ford RS200 (3874941131).jpg|thumb|The mid-engined RS200's engine bay and rear suspension]]\nPower came from a {{convert|1803|cc|L CID|1|abbr=on}}, single turbocharged Ford-[[Ford BDA|Cosworth \"BDT]]\" engine producing {{convert|250|hp|0|abbr=on}} in road-going trim, and between {{convert|350|and|450|hp|0|abbr=on}} in racing trim; upgrade kits were available for road-going versions to boost power output to over {{convert|300|hp|0|abbr=on}}. Although the RS had the balance and poise necessary to be competitive, its power-to-weight ratio was poor by comparison, and its engine produced notorious low-RPM lag, making it difficult to drive and ultimately less competitive. Factory driver [[Kalle Grundel]]'s third-place finish at the 1986 [[World Rally Championship|WRC]] Rally of Sweden represented the vehicle's best-ever finish in Group B rallying competition, although the model did see limited success outside of the ultra-competitive Group B class. However, only one event later, at the [[Rally de Portugal]], a Ford RS200 was involved in one of the most dramatic accidents in WRC history, claiming the lives of three spectators and injuring many others.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rallye-info.com/carspecs.asp?car=236 |title=Ford RS200 _ Specifications & History |publisher=Rallye-Info.com |date= |accessdate=2011-03-20}}</ref> Another Ford RS200 was crashed by Swiss Formula One driver [[Marc Surer]] against a tree during the 1986 Hessen-Rallye in Germany, killing his co-driver and friend Michel Wyder instantly.\n\n[[File:SchancheBreitenederMelk1989.jpg|thumb|left|RS200 and [[Audi Quattro S1]] competing in rallycross]]\nThe accident at Rally Portugal set off a chain reaction and the RS200 became obsolete after only one full year of competition as the [[F\u00e9d\u00e9ration Internationale de l'Automobile|FIA]], the governing board, which at the time controlled WRC rally racing, abolished Group B after the 1986 season. For 1987, Ford had planned to introduce an \"Evolution\" variant of the RS200, featuring a development of the BDT engine, called later as [[Cosworth#The BDA series|BDT-E]], displacing {{convert|2137|cc|L CID|1|abbr=on}}, developed by Briton [[Brian Hart]]. Power figures for the engine vary quite a bit from source to source, depending on the mechanical setup e.g. boost levels, power output ranges from as little as {{convert|550|hp|PS kW|0|abbr=on}} to as high as {{convert|815|hp|PS kW|0|abbr=on}}; although most typical output was {{convert|580|hp|PS kW|0|abbr=on}} at 8000 rpm and {{convert|400|lbft|Nm|0|abbr=on}} at 5500 rpm of [[torque]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.supercars.net/blog/1986-ford-rs200-evolution/|website=supercars.net|title=1986 Ford RS200 Evolution|language=en-us|date=March 6, 2016|access-date=June 16, 2018}}</ref> It has been said that the most powerful Evolution models can accelerate from 0 to {{convert|60|mi/h|km/h|abbr=on}} in just over two seconds, depending on gearing. Upgraded brakes and suspension components were part of the package as well. The ban on Group B racing effectively forced the E2 model into stillbirth; however, more than a dozen of them were successfully run from August 1986 'til October 1992 in the [[FIA European Championships for Rallycross Drivers]] events all over Europe, and Norwegian [[:de:Bild:SchancheHansen.jpg|Martin Schanche]] claimed the 1991 European [[rallycross]] title with a [[:de:Bild:SchancheRS200-1992.jpg|Ford RS200 E2]] that produced over {{convert|650|bhp|0|abbr=on}}.\n\n[[File:Ford RS200 001.JPG|thumb|left|Ford RS200 at the Spirit of Rally 2005]]\n\nOne RS200, which found its way into circuit racing, originated as a road car; it was converted to [[IMSA GT Championship|IMSA GTO]] specification powered by a 750+ BHP 2.0 litre turbo BDTE Cosworth Evolution engine.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.preromanbritain.com/gwem/martbean/rs200/imsagto.htm |title=IMSA GTO RS200 |publisher=Preromanbritain.com |accessdate=2011-03-20 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110715112336/http://www.preromanbritain.com/gwem/martbean/rs200/imsagto.htm |archivedate=2011-07-15 }}</ref> Competing against the numerous factory backed teams such as Mazda, Mercury and Nissan, with their newly built spaceframe specials, despite being a privateer, the car never achieved any real success to be a serious contender<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wspr-racing.com/wspr/results/imsa/imsagt1989.html|title=wspr-racing.com|work=wspr-racing.com}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wspr-racing.com/wspr/results/imsa/imsagt1990.html|title=wspr-racing.com|work=wspr-racing.com}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wspr-racing.com/wspr/results/imsa/imsagt1991.html|title=wspr-racing.com|work=wspr-racing.com}}</ref> and was kept by the original owner.

It was also designed by engineers who had extensive backgrounds in motorsports, and the engine had a smooth power delivery and functioned more like a racing car engine, as opposed to every one of the other highly modified production-based engines that Audi, Lancia and Peugeot had in their cars. The other famous Group B cars were all based on front-engined production models- and in both the Lancia Delta S4 and the Peugeot 205 T16's case- hatchbacks, and in the Audi Quattro's case- a luxury coupe. Although the Group B-spec S4 and T16 cars were mid-engined, they still originated as front-engined cars. Lancia's predecessor to the Delta S4- the 037- was also a mid-engined Group B supercar, but it was based on and had originated from Lancia's mid-engined Montecarlo production car.\n\n==Production==\n[[File:RS200 Blue 2.jpg|thumb|A blue production RS200.]]\n[[FIA]] homologation rules for [[Group B]] required the construction of at least 200 road-legal vehicles, and Ford constructed these 200 units with spare parts for another 20+ units put aside for the racing teams. Those chassis and spare parts were later also used to build a couple of non-genuine, so-called ''bitsa'' cars.\n\nA total of 24 of the 200 original cars were reportedly later converted to the so-called \"Evolution\" models, mostly marked by their owners as \"E\" or \"E2\" types. Ford's first intention was to mark the FIA-required 20 \"Evo\" cars as series numbers 201 to 220 but as this was actually not necessary according to the FIA rules they later kept their original series numbers (e.g. 201 = 012, 202 = 146, 203 = 174 et cetera).\n\nThe original bodywork tooling for the Ford RS200 was latterly bought by [[Banham Conversions]], who used it to make a [[kit car]] version based on the [[Austin Maestro]]. Due to being a basic rebody of the Maestro, the Austin-Rover engine ancillaries are actually to be found at the front of the vehicle.\n\n==Specification* (Group B Rally car)==\n[[File:Ford RS200 - Flickr - exfordy (1).jpg|thumb|RS200 driven at the 2010 [[Goodwood Festival of Speed]].]]\n[[File:Sports Car Museum L\u00e1ny - Ford RS 200 (rear).jpg|thumb|The rear of an RS200.]]\n{{Listen\n |filename     =Ford RS200.ogg\n |title        =Ford RS200 at Goodwood\n |type         =sound\n |style        =float:right\n}}\n\n===Engine===\n*[[Longitudinal engine|Longitudinally-mounted]], [[mid-engine, four-wheel-drive layout]]\n*Head/block [[aluminium alloy]]/aluminium alloy\n*[[Straight-4|4 cylinders in line]], [[Nikasil]] integrated liners\n*5 main bearings.

He gained fame by playing [[Liam Court]] in [[The CW]]'s [[teen drama]] series ''[[90210 (TV series)|90210]]'', a [[spin-off (media)|spin-off]] of the 1990s [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox]] series ''[[Beverly Hills, 90210]]''. He also appeared in some major released films, such as ''[[Disaster Movie]]'', ''[[WarGames: The Dead Code]]'', ''[[Sorority Row]]'', ''[[Vampires Suck]]'', ''[[The Roommate]]'', and ''[[Pitch Perfect 3]]''. He is the voice of [[Darth Vader|Anakin Skywalker]] in ''[[Star Wars: The Clone Wars (2008 TV series)|Star Wars: The Clone Wars]]'' and ''[[Star Wars Rebels]]''. From 2016 to 2018, he starred as Wyatt Logan, a time traveler, in the [[NBC]] series ''[[Timeless (TV series)|Timeless]]''.\n\n==Career==\nIn 2004, Lanter was a contestant on [[Bravo (US TV channel)|Bravo]]'s reality show ''[[Manhunt (2004 TV series)|Manhunt: The Search for America's Most Gorgeous Male Model]]''. He did not win the competition. Within a few weeks of moving to [[Los Angeles]], [[California]], Lanter successfully auditioned for the role of Nick on the supernatural teen-drama [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox]] series ''[[Point Pleasant (TV series)|Point Pleasant]]''. He had a major recurring role throughout the first and only season of the series. He has since then appeared in television shows such as ''[[Grey's Anatomy]]'', ''[[8 Simple Rules]]'', ''[[Big Love]]'' and ''[[Heroes (U.S. TV series)|Heroes]]''.\n\nIn April 2005, he signed on to become a series regular portraying the role of Horace Calloway on [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]]'s political drama series ''[[Commander in Chief (TV series)|Commander in Chief]]'', starring [[Geena Davis]] and [[Donald Sutherland]]. The series premiered on September 27, 2005, ran for one season and was cancelled on June 14, 2006.\n\nIn 2008, he took on the lead role as Zach Conroy in ''[[The Cutting Edge: Chasing the Dream]]'', with [[Francia Raisa]].\n\nIn February 2008, he was announced to portray the [[Leading actor|lead role]] of Will, in [[Lionsgate]]'s Parody/Comedy film ''[[Disaster Movie]]''. The film is written and directed by directing and screenwriting duo [[Jason Friedberg and Aaron Seltzer]] who have previously worked on other Parody films such as ''[[Meet The Spartans]]'' and ''[[Epic Movie]]''. The film spoofs recent disaster films such as ''[[Cloverfield]]''. He stars with [[Kim Kardashian]], [[Vanessa Minnillo]] and [[Carmen Electra]]. The film, which was released on August 29, 2008, was a critical failure. The film grossed over $34 million worldwide and received extremely negative reviews from critics, as well as six nominations at the [[29th Golden Raspberry Awards]].\n\nIn October 2008, he was announced to star in [[Summit Entertainment]]'s remake of the cult 1983 slasher film ''[[The House on Sorority Row]]''.
