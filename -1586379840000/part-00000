He sold his first painting through [[OK Harris Gallery]], and reviewed the first printing of his fourth book almost simultaneously with his untimely death in March 1990.

''A Teacher for all Seasons - a biography of Ray V. Sowers''.  Department of Education, Stetson University. Library of Congress Catalogue Card Number 73-L73911</ref> His art teacher in High School, Max Bernd-Cohen, encouraged his creativity, was a profound influence, and became a lifelong friend. While serving in the army at the end of [[World War 2]] he was able to study art at [[Biarritz American University]], [[Biarritz]], France. On returning to the US he enrolled at the [[New School for Social Research]], studied with the painter [[Stuart Davis (painter)|Stuart Davis]], encountered the theories of [[Rudolf Arnheim]], and graduated with a BA in 1948. In 1949 he received his MA from [[Columbia University]]. A [[Fulbright]] Award for the study of Medieval Stained Glass in the United Kingdom enabled him to attend the [[Central School of Arts & Crafts]] in London from 1950 to 1953. [[William Johnstone (artist)|William Johnstone]] was the Principal and it was here that he completed special studies in stained glass with John Baker. Returning to Manhattan he and his wife, Terry Obermayr, at first lived in a large loft on the [[Lower East Side]] and subsequently moved to a corner brownstone on Congress Street,  Cobble Hill, [[Brooklyn]], NY.<ref>Professional Stained Glass Magazine, \"Robert Sowers 1923-1990\" Obituary, May 1990, 6-9.</ref> \n\n===Career===\n[[File:RSBURLINGTON.jpg|thumb|Great Cross window, Immaculate Conception Cathedral, Burlington, Vermont, 1976]]\nSowers began to pursue stained glass commissions though it was an uphill battle to get the attention of [[Modernist architects]] of that time.<ref>Clarke, Brian (1979). \"Autonomy as a Spurious Absolute\", Robert Sowers. ''Architectural Stained Glass''.  Architectural Record Books, New York: McGraw-Hill. {{ISBN|0-07-011264-9}}.</ref> Architects whose buildings he did work on included [[Percival Goodman]], Fritz Nathan, [[Eero Saarinen]], [[Kahn & Jacobs]], [[Edward Larrabee Barnes]], Roger Ranuio, W. Brooke Fleck, Carter & Woodruff, Stanley Prowler, [[Henry Dreyfuss]], Chloetheil Smith, William Garwood, and Philip Ives. In the execution of projects he utilized traditional painted and leaded glass as well as more experimental processes of lamination with [[epoxy resins]] and [[Dalle de verre]]. This period of commissioned work as an independent artist consisted of inevitable ups and downs and it was during one of these bleak periods that he decided to reconsider [[Autonomous Stained Glass]] panels independent of an architectural setting. In 1971 he was Artist-in-Residence at Hopkins Center, [[Dartmouth College]], New Hampshire. This marked the beginning of a period of small panel making including the incorporation of various cast glass shapes salvaged from the closing sale of Leo Popper's glass warehouse in lower Manhattan, and culminating in a series of panels exhibited at the Museum of Contemporary Crafts of the [[American Craft Council]] in 1975.<ref>Museum of Contemporary Crafts of the American Crafts Council, Exhibition Robert Sowers/Stained Glass. https://digital.craftcouncil.org/digital/search/searchterm/m-m117</ref> For this panel series the design / cartoon was executed as a \"painting\" showing the details of the glass in full color. The panel and the cartoon make a pair. A number of these design/paintings are now located in the Rakow Research Library. In addition to the Fulbright Award, he also received the Silver Medal from the Architectural League in 1955 and 1962, a Tiffany Award in 1956, and a Certificate of Merit from the Municipal Art Society in 1961.\n\nThe destruction in post-war [[Germany]] created opportunities for [[stained glass]] installations in the reconstruction of religious and secular buildings and the emergence of such very different glass artists as [[Georg Meistermann]], Maria Katsgrau, Ludwig Schaffrath, [[Johannes Schreiter]], Wilhelm Buschulte, Jochem Poensgen, and Joachim Klos. Sowers developed personal relationships and enduring friendships with a number of them and, most importantly, brought awareness of their work to a younger generation of glass artists and designers around the world.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Sowers|first= Robert|year=1969|title=New Stained Glass in Germany|journal=Craft Horizons|volume= 29|issue=3|pages= 15-38|url=https://digital.craftcouncil.org/digital/collection/p15785coll2/id/7659}}</ref> In America these included David Wilson, Kenneth von Roenn, [[Peter Mollica]], Ed Carpenter, and [[Robert Kehlmann]]. Sowers also stressed that artists in Germany operated as independent designers associating with the established studios as fabricators. He was antithetical to the prevalent system in the [[United States]] where the studios retained their own in-house designers to produce essentially commercial stained glass windows. His dissemination of this departure from the norm and his encouragement of younger individual artists was one of his great contributions. It was a stimulating period for the reemergence of stained glass in the 1960s and 1970s as a truly architectural art while simultaneously opening up experimentation in other forms of glass art.\n\n\n==Work==\n=== American Airlines Terminal ===\nThe [[American Airlines]] project was Sowers' most important commission. Completed in 1960, it was an iconic glass mural 317' long by 23' high covering the entire facade of the building designed by Kahn & Jacobs for what was then [[Idlewild Airport]] in [[Queens, New York]] - renamed after the Kennedy assassination to [[John F. Kennedy International Airport]].<ref>AirportHistory.org, New York John F. Kennedy Airport, Part 4, the First Airline Terminals. https://www.airporthistory.org/kennedy-4.html</ref> It was composed partially of a German opaque glass that was quite unusual, consisting of both transparent blues and reds on a solid white base. The design was also unusual in that it was seen in its entirety from the exterior as a form of mosaic.<ref>Glascock, Sandra (April 15, 2016). \"Come Fly with Me\". Corning Museum of Glass. https://blog.cmog.org/2016/04/15/exploring-the-archives-come-fly-with-me/</ref> Traditionally architectural stained glass was viewed, and therefore designed the other way around, from the inside looking out. Additionally, once inside the terminal it would never be experienced as a whole. Historically early church and [[cathedral]] stained glass walls read as dark surfaces, thus the need to utilize dense opaque glass. Additionally, the system was single glazed which meant that the colors were seen to maximum effect as travelers approached the terminal. The idea of developing a reversible image was picked up and pursued by the architect, [[Percival Goodman]], whose projects included many Synagogues. He felt that as a number of services were conducted at nighttime any stained glass should work in some way under reverse conditions. Sowers completed several Synagogue projects for Goodman. The terminal project was fabricated and installed by the [[Rambusch Decorating Company]] in New York, a long established commercial studio where he executed a considerable number of commissions. In the early 1980s, because of frame and moisture issues together with heating and cooling problems inside the building, Rohlf's Stained & Leaded Glass Studio, [[Mount Vernon, New York]] was retained to superimpose aluminum framing and tempered glass on the exterior of the existing frame. This resolved those problems but did not improve the outside appearance due to increased surface reflection coming off the new layer of glass. By 2006 when [[American Airlines]] was expanding and rebuilding their terminal it was determined that the mural was too big to save. Notice was given for dismantling, removal, and possible destruction. Initial reuse suggestions included making key chains for airline employees but not carried out. This generated a futile movement to preserve it. A group, ''Save America's Window'', was formed to try to retain it as a whole, a daunting and hugely expensive proposition. A hasty email exchange between glass artists who were influenced and indebted to Sowers, glass studios and enthusiasts, Judi Jordan his second wife, and Eileen Vaquilar Clifford a flight attendant for American who had great affection for the artwork, explored all possibilities. These included acquisition by various Museums and Institutions but ultimately there were no viable options, with one minor exception whereby the Airline donated 8 sections to the Madison Museum of Fine Art, Madison, Wisconsin.<ref>Madison Museum of Fine Art Preserves a Piece of Stained Glass History. http://mmofa.org/who-are-you/press/robert-sowers-window/</ref> It was dismantled as salvage by Good Olde Things / Good Olde Glass with individual sections to be sold as mementos.<ref name=\"NYT Kennedy International 2002\">{{cite news | url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/02/22/nyregion/22window.html | title=A Window That Reflected a Golden Age Comes Down at Kennedy Airport | work=The New York Times | date=22 February 2008 | accessdate=12 March 2020 | author=Kelson, Ben}}</ref><ref>Westfeldt, Amy (Feb. 21, 2008).  \"JFK stained glass-work is too large for museums\".

Photographing [[stained glass]] requires considerable expertise to be successful. This is due to the intense variation in saturation and contrast for which the eye compensates but the camera lens does not. At that time a [[light meter]] was of prime importance to average out and bracket film exposure. On one of his trips to [[Europe]] he spent time in [[Chartres Cathedral]] gauging the intensity of the blue glass and he was astonished by the variation of light value compared to the dilation of the human eye.<ref>Sowers, Robert (1966). \"On The Blues in Chartres\". ''[[The Art Bulletin]]''.  https://www.jstor.org/stable/3048369?seq=1</ref><ref>Johnson, James R. (1963). \"The Stained Glass Theories of [[Viollet le Duc]]\". ''[[The Art Bulletin]]''.  https://www.jstor.org/stable/3048077?seq=1</ref> He also spent time in [[Germany]] photographing the work of fellow glass artists primarily for illustrating his books but also for dissemination back home. His photographic work expanded when he took his camera on long walking trips in different parts of the city shooting film in both B/W and 35mm [[Kodachrome]] slide format. Sunday wandering included downtown [[Manhattan]] and [[Brooklyn]] between the bridges when these neighborhoods were essentially deserted. One prime set of these slides were unfortunately stolen stolen but an extensive archive still exists. For his B/W work he did all his own enlarging and printing.\n\n=== Painting ===\nIn 1979 Sowers went back his first love of painting full-time. He had moved to a loft building on Degraw Street in [[Brooklyn]] where the space and light were perfect. The first canvases were monochromatic in tones of black and white with an abstract expressionistic sensibility which on closer study reveal an architectural reference. From this beginning he introduced color and began working directly from his series of 35mm slides, a result of his photographic exploration of the city in all it's varied landscapes of streets, bridges, buildings, trash, junk, people, parks, and gardens. Nothing escaped his eye through the lens. As a glass artist his prime concern had been with light and this was also a preoccupation in his photographs and paintings. The exploration of light, a common thread in these paintings executed in a [[photorealistic]] style, represent a clear departure from his work in glass. The canvases uniformly conform to a 40\" X 50\" format, either vertically or horizontally. They are signed on the back with the date and '''RWS''', one of the few occasions in his professional life that he used his middle initial. In 1988 / 89 he participated in a two person show at the OK South Gallery in Miami. His death in 1990 coincided with the sale of his first painting, \"Stripes\", through [[Ivan Karp]]'s [[OK Harris Gallery]] in New York and the publication of his fourth book \"Rethinking the Forms of Visual Expression\".<ref>Mennekes, Friedhelm (1987). \"Interview with Robert Sowers\".

Berkley: University of California Press. {{ISBN|0-520-06632-4}}</ref> A number of his paintings have been posthumously placed in private collections. \n\n=== Books and writing ===\nSowers was an ambitious thinker and writer, always wishing to complement his stained-glass art with critical reflection. His ambition shows in his heavily illustrated first book, ''The Lost Art: A Survey of One Thousand Years of Stained Glass'' (1954).<ref>{{Cite book|last=Sowers|first=Robert|title=The Lost Art: A Survey of One Thousand Years of Stained Glass|publisher=Wittenborn|year=1954|isbn=|location=New York|pages=}}</ref> Sowers drew upon his experience with English stained glass but also reflected on the status of the art as a problem of modernism. Its seriousness is marked by the Preface written by the English modernist scholar, Herbert Read. Around 1960, Sowers was increasingly struck by the tendency to pictorialize stained glass. He sensed that this was symptomatic both of modernism and also an inability to understand the true nature of stained glass. In his \u201cMatisse and Chagall as Craftsmen\u201d published in ''Craft Horizons'' in 1962, he reported Matisse\u2019s anecdote about his murals for the Barnes Foundation and how mural painting was different from easel painting and must \u201ctranslate paint into architecture.\u201d<ref>{{Cite book|last=Barr, Alfred H., Jr., 1902-1981.|url=http://worldcat.org/oclc/16300001|title=Matisse, his art and his public|date=1975|publisher=Secker and Warburg|isbn=0-436-03358-5|oclc=16300001}}</ref> Matisse had understood that murals serve architecture. But his contemporaries had not learned this lesson and Sowers criticized harshly Chagall\u2019s and Rouault\u2019s pictorialized stained glass.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Sowers|first=Robert|date=1962|title=\"Matisse and Chagall as Craftsmen\"|url=|journal=Craft Horizons|volume=|pages=29-30|via=}}</ref> The greatest failure for stained glass was the church of Assy, decorated by all the old living masters of French art. Sowers would later liken the church, treated by William Rubin in high modernist fashion as a successful collaboration, as so many ''cadavres exquis''.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Rubin|first=William|title=Modern Sacred Art and the Church of Assy|publisher=Columbia University Press|year=1962|isbn=|location=New York|pages=}}</ref> Each artist treated his contribution like a pictorial work that would merely be executed by stained glass specialists. The works were not coordinated to the main building, nor to each other. \n\n\nIn 1965, Sowers published his second major work on stained glass: ''Stained Glass: An Architectural Art'' [New York: Universe Books].<ref>{{Cite book|last=Sowers|first=Robert|title=Stained Glass: An Architectural Art|publisher=Universe Books|year=1965|isbn=|location=New York|pages=}}</ref> Noting the great variety of contemporary artistic and architectural practice, he registered the challenges to cooperation. He clarified that stained glass is an \u201cart of the wall, an art of fenestration\u201d (p. 90) and ought to be hierarchically related to the building in which it is housed. Sowers was not rigid and affirmed that the relative balance of ornament and image \u201cis itself a part of the aesthetic statement\u201d (p. 92). Through his artistic experimentation in the 1970s, Sowers was able to reflect more critically on major aesthetic questions. This coincided with his sensitive reflection on some actual art historical questions<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Sowers|first=Robert|date=1982|title=A Hypothesis about the West Front of Chartres|url=|journal=Art Bulletin|volume=64|pages=622|via=}}</ref> and a major aesthetics essay on fundamental modalities. Although the two corresponded for decades, Sowers and Rudolf Arnheim had an intense conversation when Sowers attempted to boil down artistic practice to \u201cA Theory of Primary Modalities in the Visual Arts,\u201d published in the ''Journal of Aesthetics and Art Criticism'' [1984].<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Sowers|first=Robert|date=1984|title=A Theory of Primary Modalities in the Visual Arts|url=|journal=Journal of Aesthetics and Art Criticism|volume=42|pages=271-76|via=}}</ref> Sowers was challenged by both historical variety but also the latest contemporary art. He argued that there are three primary modalities: the pictorial, the sculptural and the architectural. He did not valorize purity of modality but argued that each was a kind of \u201ccenter\u201d that organized artistic practice. For example, a sculpture does not indiscriminately grade into architecture because the latter requires habitation. So, an obelisk, for example, visibly pulls between sculpturality \u2013 for lack of habitation \u2013 and architecture \u2013 for scale.\n\n\nWith the encouragement of Arnheim, Sowers continued to develop the ideas in this paper into a book, which became ''Rethinking the Forms of Visual Experience''.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Sowers|first=Robert|title=Rethinking the Forms of Visual Expression|publisher=University of California Press|year=1990|isbn=|location=Berkeley|pages=}}</ref> He built off of the theory of primaries to return to architecture and stained glass in order to explain succinctly how he thought that stained-glass was an \u201callied art\u201d of architecture, the art of painting with \u201cstructure and light.\u201d In 1993, after Sowers\u2019 death, Arnheim positively reviewed the book for Leonardo<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Arnheim|first=Robert|date=1993|title=Review of Rethinking the Forms of Visual Expression|url=|journal=Leonardo|volume=26|pages=172|via=}}</ref> \n<br />\n=== Major commissions ===\n* St George's Church, [[Durham, New Hampshire]].

He was an exceptional photographer documenting his own as well as other artist's glass work and spent many hours walking the streets and parks of [[Manhattan]] and [[Brooklyn]] with camera in hand.

The family moved to [[Florida]] in 1932 because his father Ray Sowers, a highly respected educator, was offered a position in the state.<ref>Dan A. Davis & Michael E. Duclos (1971).

Library of Congress Catalogue Card Number 73-L73911</ref> His art teacher in High School, Max Bernd-Cohen, encouraged his creativity, was a profound influence, and became a lifelong friend. While serving in the army at the end of [[World War 2]] he was able to study art at [[Biarritz American University]], [[Biarritz]], France. On returning to the US he enrolled at the [[New School for Social Research]], studied with the painter [[Stuart Davis]], encountered the theories of [[Rudolf Arnheim]], and graduated with a BA in 1948. In 1949 he received his MA from [[Columbia University]]. A [[Fulbright]] Award for the study of Medieval Stained Glass in the United Kingdom enabled him to attend the [[Central School of Arts & Crafts]] in London from 1950 to 1953. [[William Johnstone (artist)|William Johnstone]] was the Principal and it was here that he completed special studies in stained glass with John Baker. Returning to Manhattan he and his wife, Terry Obermayr, at first lived in a large loft on the [[Lower East Side]] and subsequently moved to a corner brownstone on Congress Street,  Cobble Hill, [[Brooklyn]], NY.<ref>Professional Stained Glass Magazine, \"Robert Sowers 1923-1990\" Obituary, May 1990, 6-9.</ref> \n\n===Career===\n[[File:RSBURLINGTON.jpg|thumb|Great Cross window, Immaculate Conception Cathedral, Burlington, Vermont, 1976]]\nSowers began to pursue stained glass commissions though it was an uphill battle to get the attention of [[Modernist architects]] of that time.<ref>Clarke, Brian (1979). \"Autonomy as a Spurious Absolute\", Robert Sowers. ''Architectural Stained Glass''.  Architectural Record Books, New York: McGraw-Hill. {{ISBN|0-07-011264-9}}.</ref> Architects whose buildings he did work on included [[Percival Goodman]], Fritz Nathan, [[Eero Saarinen]], [[Kahn & Jacobs]], [[Edward Larrabee Barnes]], Roger Ranuio, W. Brooke Fleck, Carter & Woodruff, Stanley Prowler, [[Henry Dreyfuss]], Chloetheil Smith, William Garwood, and Philip Ives. In the execution of projects he utilized traditional painted and leaded glass as well as more experimental processes of lamination with [[epoxy resins]] and [[Dalle de verre]]. This period of commissioned work as an independent artist consisted of inevitable ups and downs and it was during one of these bleak periods that he decided to reconsider [[Autonomous Stained Glass]] panels independent of an architectural setting. In 1971 he was Artist-in-Residence at Hopkins Center, [[Dartmouth College]], New Hampshire. This marked the beginning of a period of small panel making including the incorporation of various cast glass shapes salvaged from the closing sale of Leo Popper's glass warehouse in lower Manhattan, and culminating in a series of panels exhibited at the Museum of Contemporary Crafts of the [[American Craft Council]] in 1975.<ref>Museum of Contemporary Crafts of the American Crafts Council, Exhibition Robert Sowers/Stained Glass. https://digital.craftcouncil.org/digital/search/searchterm/m-m117</ref> For this panel series the design / cartoon was executed as a \"painting\" showing the details of the glass in full color. The panel and the cartoon make a pair. A number of these design/paintings are now located in the Rakow Research Library. In addition to the Fulbright Award, he also received the Silver Medal from the Architectural League in 1955 and 1962, a Tiffany Award in 1956, and a Certificate of Merit from the Municipal Art Society in 1961.\n\nThe destruction in post-war [[Germany]] created opportunities for [[stained glass]] installations in the reconstruction of religious and secular buildings and the emergence of such very different glass artists as [[Georg Meistermann]], Maria Katsgrau, Ludwig Schaffrath, [[Johannes Schreiter]], Wilhelm Buschulte, Jochem Poensgen, and Joachim Klos. Sowers developed personal relationships and enduring friendships with a number of them and, most importantly, brought awareness of their work to a younger generation of glass artists and designers around the world.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Sowers|first= Robert|year=1969|title=New Stained Glass in Germany|journal=Craft Horizons|volume= 29|issue=3|pages= 15-38|url=https://digital.craftcouncil.org/digital/collection/p15785coll2/id/7659}}</ref> In America these included David Wilson, Kenneth von Roenn, [[Peter Mollica]], Ed Carpenter, and [[Robert Kehlmann]]. Sowers also stressed that artists in Germany operated as independent designers associating with the established studios as fabricators. He was antithetical to the prevalent system in the [[United States]] where the studios retained their own in-house designers to produce essentially commercial stained glass windows. His dissemination of this departure from the norm and his encouragement of younger individual artists was one of his great contributions. It was a stimulating period for the reemergence of stained glass in the 1960s and 1970s as a truly architectural art while simultaneously opening up experimentation in other forms of glass art.\n\n\n==Work==\n=== American Airlines Terminal ===\nThe [[American Airlines]] project was Sowers' most important commission. Completed in 1960, it was an iconic glass mural 317' long by 23' high covering the entire facade of the building designed by Kahn & Jacobs for what was then [[Idlewild Airport]] in [[Queens, New York]] - renamed after the Kennedy assassination to [[John F. Kennedy International Airport]].<ref>AirportHistory.org, New York John F. Kennedy Airport, Part 4, the First Airline Terminals. https://www.airporthistory.org/kennedy-4.html</ref> It was composed partially of a German opaque glass that was quite unusual, consisting of both transparent blues and reds on a solid white base. The design was also unusual in that it was seen in its entirety from the exterior as a form of mosaic.<ref>Glascock, Sandra (April 15, 2016). \"Come Fly with Me\". Corning Museum of Glass. https://blog.cmog.org/2016/04/15/exploring-the-archives-come-fly-with-me/</ref> Traditionally architectural stained glass was viewed, and therefore designed the other way around, from the inside looking out. Additionally, once inside the terminal it would never be experienced as a whole. Historically early church and [[cathedral]] stained glass walls read as dark surfaces, thus the need to utilize dense opaque glass. Additionally, the system was single glazed which meant that the colors were seen to maximum effect as travelers approached the terminal. The idea of developing a reversible image was picked up and pursued by the architect, [[Percival Goodman]], whose projects included many Synagogues. He felt that as a number of services were conducted at nighttime any stained glass should work in some way under reverse conditions. Sowers completed several Synagogue projects for Goodman. The terminal project was fabricated and installed by the [[Rambusch Decorating Company]] in New York, a long established commercial studio where he executed a considerable number of commissions. In the early 1980s, because of frame and moisture issues together with heating and cooling problems inside the building, Rohlf's Stained & Leaded Glass Studio, [[Mount Vernon, New York]] was retained to superimpose aluminum framing and tempered glass on the exterior of the existing frame. This resolved those problems but did not improve the outside appearance due to increased surface reflection coming off the new layer of glass. By 2006 when [[American Airlines]] was expanding and rebuilding their terminal it was determined that the mural was too big to save. Notice was given for dismantling, removal, and possible destruction. Initial reuse suggestions included making key chains for airline employees but not carried out. This generated a futile movement to preserve it. A group, ''Save America's Window'', was formed to try to retain it as a whole, a daunting and hugely expensive proposition. A hasty email exchange between glass artists who were influenced and indebted to Sowers, glass studios and enthusiasts, Judi Jordan his second wife, and Eileen Vaquilar Clifford a flight attendant for American who had great affection for the artwork, explored all possibilities. These included acquisition by various Museums and Institutions but ultimately there were no viable options, with one minor exception whereby the Airline donated 8 sections to the Madison Museum of Fine Art, Madison, Wisconsin.<ref>Madison Museum of Fine Art Preserves a Piece of Stained Glass History. http://mmofa.org/who-are-you/press/robert-sowers-window/</ref> It was dismantled as salvage by Good Olde Things / Good Olde Glass with individual sections to be sold as mementos.<ref name=\"NYT Kennedy International 2002\">{{cite news | url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/02/22/nyregion/22window.html | title=A Window That Reflected a Golden Age Comes Down at Kennedy Airport | work=The New York Times | date=22 February 2008 | accessdate=12 March 2020 | author=Kelson, Ben}}</ref><ref>Westfeldt, Amy (Feb. 21, 2008).  \"JFK stained glass-work is too large for museums\".

Photographing [[stained glass]] requires considerable expertise to be successful. This is due to the intense variation in saturation and contrast for which the eye compensates but the camera lens does not. At that time a [[light meter]] was of prime importance to average out and bracket film exposure. On one of his trips to [[Europe]] he spent time in [[Chartres Cathedral]] gauging the intensity of the blue glass and he was astonished by the variation of light value compared to the dilation of the human eye.<ref>Sowers, Robert (1966). \"On The Blues in Chartres\". ''[[The Art Bulletin]]''.  https://www.jstor.org/stable/3048369?seq=1</ref><ref>Johnson, James R. (1963). \"The Stained Glass Theories of [[Viollet le Duc]]\". ''[[The Art Bulletin]]''.  https://www.jstor.org/stable/3048077?seq=1</ref> He also spent time in [[Germany]] photographing the work of fellow glass artists primarily for illustrating his books but also for dissemination back home. His photographic work expanded when he took his camera on long walking trips in different parts of the city shooting film in both B/W and 35mm [[Kodachrome]] slide format. Sunday wandering included downtown [[Manhattan]] and [[Brooklyn]] between the bridges when these neighborhoods were essentially deserted. One prime set of these slides were unfortunately stolen stolen but an extensive archive still exists. For his B/W work he did all his own enlarging and printing.\n\n=== Painting ===\nIn 1979 Sowers went back his first love of painting full-time. He had moved to a loft building on Degraw Street in [[Brooklyn]] where the space and light were perfect. The first canvases were monochromatic in tones of black and white with an abstract expressionistic sensibility which on closer study reveal an architectural reference. From this beginning he introduced color and began working directly from his series of 35mm slides, a result of his photographic exploration of the city in all it's varied landscapes of streets, bridges, buildings, trash, junk, people, parks, and gardens. Nothing escaped his eye through the lens. As a glass artist his prime concern had been with light and this was also a preoccupation in his photographs and paintings. The exploration of light, a common thread in these paintings executed in a [[photorealistic]] style, represent a clear departure from his work in glass. The canvases uniformly conform to a 40\" X 50\" format, either vertically or horizontally. They are signed on the back with the date and '''RWS''', one of the few occasions in his professional life that he used his middle initial. In 1988 / 89 he participated in a two person show at the OK South Gallery in Miami. His death in 1990 coincided with the sale of his first painting, \"Stripes\", through [[Ivan Karp]]'s [[OK Harris Gallery]] in New York and the publication of his fourth book \"Rethinking the Forms of Visual Expression\".<ref>Mennekes, Friedhelm (1987). \"Interview with Robert Sowers\".

Berkley: University of California Press. {{ISBN|0-520-06632-4}}</ref> A number of his paintings have been posthumously placed in private collections. \n\n=== Books and writing ===\nSowers was an ambitious thinker and writer, always wishing to complement his stained-glass art with critical reflection. His ambition shows in his heavily illustrated first book, ''The Lost Art: A Survey of One Thousand Years of Stained Glass'' (1954).<ref>{{Cite book|last=Sowers|first=Robert|title=The Lost Art: A Survey of One Thousand Years of Stained Glass|publisher=Wittenborn|year=1954|isbn=|location=New York|pages=}}</ref> Sowers drew upon his experience with English stained glass but also reflected on the status of the art as a problem of modernism. Its seriousness is marked by the Preface written by the English modernist scholar, Herbert Read. Around 1960, Sowers was increasingly struck by the tendency to pictorialize stained glass. He sensed that this was symptomatic both of modernism and also an inability to understand the true nature of stained glass. In his \u201cMatisse and Chagall as Craftsmen\u201d published in ''Craft Horizons'' in 1962, he reported Matisse\u2019s anecdote about his murals for the Barnes Foundation and how mural painting was different from easel painting and must \u201ctranslate paint into architecture.\u201d<ref>{{Cite book|last=Barr, Alfred H., Jr., 1902-1981.|url=http://worldcat.org/oclc/16300001|title=Matisse, his art and his public|date=1975|publisher=Secker and Warburg|isbn=0-436-03358-5|oclc=16300001}}</ref> Matisse had understood that murals serve architecture.

Sowers would later liken the church, treated by William Rubin in high modernist fashion as a successful collaboration, as so many ''cadavres exquis''.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Rubin|first=William|title=Modern Sacred Art and the Church of Assy|publisher=Columbia University Press|year=1962|isbn=|location=New York|pages=}}</ref> Each artist treated his contribution like a pictorial work that would merely be executed by stained glass specialists. The works were not coordinated to the main building, nor to each other. \n\n\nIn 1965, Sowers published his second major work on stained glass: ''Stained Glass: An Architectural Art'' [New York: Universe Books].<ref>{{Cite book|last=Sowers|first=Robert|title=Stained Glass: An Architectural Art|publisher=Universe Books|year=1965|isbn=|location=New York|pages=}}</ref> Noting the great variety of contemporary artistic and architectural practice, he registered the challenges to cooperation. He clarified that stained glass is an \u201cart of the wall, an art of fenestration\u201d (p. 90) and ought to be hierarchically related to the building in which it is housed. Sowers was not rigid and affirmed that the relative balance of ornament and image \u201cis itself a part of the aesthetic statement\u201d (p. 92). Through his artistic experimentation in the 1970s, Sowers was able to reflect more critically on major aesthetic questions. This coincided with his sensitive reflection on some actual art historical questions<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Sowers|first=Robert|date=1982|title=A Hypothesis about the West Front of Chartres|url=|journal=Art Bulletin|volume=64|pages=622|via=}}</ref> and a major aesthetics essay on fundamental modalities. Although the two corresponded for decades, Sowers and Rudolf Arnheim had an intense conversation when Sowers attempted to boil down artistic practice to \u201cA Theory of Primary Modalities in the Visual Arts,\u201d published in the ''Journal of Aesthetics and Art Criticism'' [1984].<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Sowers|first=Robert|date=1984|title=A Theory of Primary Modalities in the Visual Arts|url=|journal=Journal of Aesthetics and Art Criticism|volume=42|pages=271-76|via=}}</ref> Sowers was challenged by both historical variety but also the latest contemporary art. He argued that there are three primary modalities: the pictorial, the sculptural and the architectural. He did not valorize purity of modality but argued that each was a kind of \u201ccenter\u201d that organized artistic practice. For example, a sculpture does not indiscriminately grade into architecture because the latter requires habitation. So, an obelisk, for example, visibly pulls between sculpturality \u2013 for lack of habitation \u2013 and architecture \u2013 for scale.\n\n\nWith the encouragement of Arnheim, Sowers continued to develop the ideas in this paper into a book, which became ''Rethinking the Forms of Visual Experience''.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Sowers|first=Robert|title=Rethinking the Forms of Visual Expression|publisher=University of California Press|year=1990|isbn=|location=Berkeley|pages=}}</ref> He built off of the theory of primaries to return to architecture and stained glass in order to explain succinctly how he thought that stained-glass was an \u201callied art\u201d of architecture, the art of painting with \u201cstructure and light.\u201d In 1993, after Sowers\u2019 death, Arnheim positively reviewed the book for Leonardo<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Arnheim|first=Robert|date=1993|title=Review of Rethinking the Forms of Visual Expression|url=|journal=Leonardo|volume=26|pages=172|via=}}</ref> \n<br />\n=== Major commissions ===\n* St George's Church, [[Durham, New Hampshire]].

He received his formal education at Filby Primary School, Great Yarmouth; Great Yarmouth Technical High School, [[Goldsmiths, University of London|Goldsmiths College]], London University, and the [[London School of Economics]]. From 1961 to 1969 he was employed as a school teacher.\n\n==Political and civic career==\nCarttiss joined the [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative Party]] in the early 1960s, and was elected as a councillor with the Party to [[Norfolk County Council]] for the 'West Flegg Division' in 1966 at the age of 28. He remained as County Councillor from 1966 to 1985. In 1972 he held the post of Vice-Chair of the County Council's Education Committee, and was that Committee's Chair from 1980\u20131985.\n\nBetween 1969-1982 Carttiss was employed as a professional [[Election Agent]] for the Conservative Party in the Yarmouth area.\n\nFrom 1981-1985 he was the Chair of the Norfolk Museum Service, and served on the East Anglia Regional Health Authority; and from 1981 to 1985 he served on the Great Yarmouth Port & Haven Commission.\n\nFrom 1973-1982 he was also a Councillor on [[Great Yarmouth Borough Council]], which he became the political leader of from 1980 to 1982.\n\nIn 1982 the sitting Conservative Member of Parliament, [[Anthony Fell (politician)|Anthony Fell]], retired and Carttiss was selected by the Great Yarmouth Conservative Association at the age of 44 to contest the seat in the [[1983 United Kingdom general election|1983 general election]], which he won with a 5,309 vote majority, receiving 50.5% of the overall votes cast.\n\nIn the [[House of Commons]] Carttiss aligned himself with the Radical right of the Conservative Party, and was a backbench supporter of [[Margaret Thatcher]] through the 1980s at a time of upheaval in British politics.\n\nIn the [[1987 United Kingdom general election|1987 general election]] he was returned as Great Yarmouth's Member of Parliament with a 10,083 vote majority (51.7% of the votes cast), making the constituency an apparently \"safe\" Conservative Party seat in the Commons.\n\nDuring a debate in the House of Commons' Chamber on 22 November 1990, a few hours after Margaret Thatcher had announced her resignation as Prime Minister in acrimonious circumstances, Carttiss' loud shout of encouragement to her as she verbally attacked the opposition [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]], with \"Cancel the resignation, cancel the resignation, you can wipe the floor with these people!\", was clearly audible, and was recorded in ''[[Hansard]]''.

When he voted against the 'European Communities (Finance) Bill', a part of the Treaty being rendered into United Kingdom statute in November 1994, Carttiss was one of eight Conservative MPs to have the Conservative Parliamentary Whip withdrawn. On the calling of a confidence motion in John Major's Government in the same month, with the European Communities (Finance) Bill attached to it, rather than bring the Conservative Government down, Carttiss voted to support the Government and the passage of the E.C. (Finance) Bill, with all but one of the other \"[[Maastricht Rebels]]' doing the same, signaling the end of their stand and acquiescence to the Government's will in the matter.
