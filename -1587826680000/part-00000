He was among a group of more than one hundred Native Hawaiian and Hawaii-born combatants in the [[American Civil War]], at a time when the [[Kingdom of Hawaii]] was still an independent nation.\n\nEnlisting in the Union Navy in 1864, Bush served as a sailor aboard {{USS|Vandalia|1828|6}} and the captured Confederate vessel {{USS|Beauregard|1861|6}}, which maintained the [[Union blockade|blockade]] of the ports of the [[Confederate States of America|Confederacy]]. He was discharged from service in 1865 after an injury, which developed into a chronic condition in later life. The impoverished Bush was unable to return to Hawaii for more than a decade, during which time he traveled through [[New England]] and much of the Pacific. Back in Hawaii, he worked as a government tax collector and road supervisor for the island of [[Kauai]], where he settled down. In later life, he converted to [[Mormonism]] and became an active member of the [[The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints in Hawaii|Hawaiian Mission]]. After the annexation of Hawaii to the United States, Bush was recognized for his military service, and in 1905 was granted a government pension for the injuries he received in the Navy. He died at his home on Kauai on April 24, 1906.\n\nFor a long period after the Civil War, the legacy and contributions of Bush and other documented Hawaiian participants were largely forgotten except in the private circles of descendants and historians. There has been a revival of interest, especially through the efforts of his great-grandniece Edna Bush Ellis and others in the Hawaiian community. In 2010, the \"Hawai\u02bbi Sons of the Civil War\" were commemorated with a bronze plaque erected along the memorial pathway at the [[National Memorial Cemetery of the Pacific]] in [[Honolulu]].\n\n==Early life==\nJames Wood Bush was born in [[Honolulu]].

He was among a group of more than one hundred Native Hawaiian and Hawaii-born combatants in the [[American Civil War]], at a time when the [[Kingdom of Hawaii]] was still an independent nation.\n\nEnlisting in the Union Navy in 1864, Bush served as a sailor aboard {{USS|Vandalia|1828|6}} and the captured Confederate vessel {{USS|Beauregard|1861|6}}, which maintained the [[Union blockade|blockade]] of the ports of the [[Confederate States of America|Confederacy]]. He was discharged from service in 1865 after an injury, which developed into a chronic condition in later life. The impoverished Bush was unable to return to Hawaii for more than a decade, during which time he traveled through [[New England]] and much of the Pacific. Back in Hawaii, he worked as a government tax collector and road supervisor for the island of [[Kauai]], where he settled down. In later life, he converted to [[Mormonism]] and became an active member of the [[The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints in Hawaii|Hawaiian Mission]]. After the annexation of Hawaii to the United States, Bush was recognized for his military service, and in 1905 was granted a government pension for the injuries he received in the Navy. He died at his home on Kauai on April 24, 1906.\n\nFor a long period after the Civil War, the legacy and contributions of Bush and other documented Hawaiian participants were largely forgotten except in the private circles of descendants and historians. There has been a revival of interest, especially through the efforts of his great-grandniece Edna Bush Ellis and others in the Hawaiian community. In 2010, the \"Hawai\u02bbi Sons of the Civil War\" were commemorated with a bronze plaque erected along the memorial pathway at the [[National Memorial Cemetery of the Pacific]] in [[Honolulu]].\n\n==Early life==\nJames Wood Bush was born in [[Honolulu]].

Renewed interest in the stories of these individuals and this particular period of Hawaiian-American history has inspired efforts to preserve the memories of the Hawaiians who served in the war.{{sfn|Vance|Manning|2015c|pages=161\u2013163}}\n\nStating that \"our boys from Hawaii\" should be remembered, Bush's great-grandniece Edna Bush Ellis was influential in reviving interest and in the effort to install a memorial recognizing their legacy.{{sfn|Vance|Manning|2015c|pages=161\u2013163}}<ref>{{harvnb|Burlingame|2008}}; {{harvnb|Lewis|2014}}</ref> On August&nbsp;26, 2010, on the anniversary of the signing of the Hawaiian Neutrality Proclamation, a bronze plaque was erected along the memorial pathway at the [[National Memorial Cemetery of the Pacific]] in Honolulu recognizing the \"Hawai\u02bbi Sons of the Civil War\", the more than one hundred Hawaiians who were documented as serving during the American Civil War for both the Union and the Confederacy.{{sfn|Vance|Manning|2015c|pages=161\u2013163}}<ref name=\"Cole2010\">{{harvnb|Cole|2010}}</ref> As of 2014, researchers have identified 119 documented Native Hawaiian and Hawaii-born combatants from historical records.

Prior to the 14th century the army consisted of European-style noble cavalry armed with [[bow and arrow|bows]] and [[lances]] (replaced with crossbows in the 14th century) and infantry armed with [[spear]]s, javelins and bows. With the economic growth from mining, mercenary knights from Western Europe were recruited to finalize and increase the effectiveness of the army, especially throughout 14th century.\n\n== History ==\n{{main|Serbia in the Middle Ages}}\n\n===Early===\n{{see also|9th century in Serbia|10th century in Serbia}}\n[[File:BMM-WeaponsOfRa\u0161kaAndZetaInMiddleAges1.JPG|thumb|Axes dating to the 9th century.]]\nBetween 839 and 842 the Bulgar Khan [[Presian I of Bulgaria|Presian]] invaded inland parts of the Serbian territory, the two having lived peacefully sharing a common frontier up until that point. The cause for the invasion is unclear. It led to a war that lasted three years, in which the Bulgars were decisively defeated. In the mid 850s the Bulgarians under [[Boris I of Bulgaria|Boris I]] made another unsuccessful attempt to subdue the Serbs. In the beginning of the 10th century [[Simeon I of Bulgaria|Simeon I]] launched several campaigns against the Serbs who were acting as Byzantine allies and by 925 he managed to conquer Serbia completely but the Bulgarian rule was short-lived. [[Samuel of Bulgaria]] subjected the Serbs for a second time in 1009 or 1010 after he defeated their ruler [[Jovan Vladimir]].<ref>{{citation| last=\u017divkovi\u0107| first=Tibor| year=2002| script-title=sr:\u041f\u043e\u0445\u043e\u0434 \u0431\u0443\u0433\u0430\u0440\u0441\u043a\u043e\u0433 \u0446\u0430\u0440\u0430 \u0421\u0430\u043c\u0443\u0438\u043b\u0430 \u043d\u0430 \u0414\u0430\u043b\u043c\u0430\u0446\u0438\u0458\u0443| journal=Istorijski \u010dasopis| volume=49| publisher=The Institute of History of the [[Serbian Academy of Sciences and Arts]]| place=Belgrade| language=Serbian| issn=0350-0802| pages=9\u201324| mode=cs1}}</ref>\n\n10th-century Byzantine military manuals mention ''chonsarioi'', light cavalry formations recruited in the Balkans, especially Serbs, \"ideal for scouting and raiding\".<ref name=\"Brzezinski2006\">{{cite book|author=Richard Brzezinski|title=Polish Winged Hussar 1576-1775|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=GCW2VIgJ5o0C&pg=PA5|year=2006|publisher=Osprey Publishing|isbn=978-1-84176-650-8|pages=5\u2013}}</ref> These units are considered a precursor of [[Hussar]] cavalry formations later found in Hungarian and Polish armies.\n\n===11th century===\n\n===12th century===\nThe writings of [[John Kinnamos]] and other contemporary Byzantine sources (Anna Komnene, Niketas Choniates, Eustathios of Thessalonica, Michael of Thessalonica) of the twelfth century, gives substantial data concerning Serbian armament and tactics.<ref name=Draskovic>Dra\u0161kovi\u0107, M. 2010, \"Serbian armament and tactics in writings of John Kinnamos\", Vojno-istorijski glasnik, no. 2, pp. 9-19.</ref>\n\n*As primary weapons of the Serbs, Kinnamos mentions spears and long shields. The terms he uses for these weapons (borata and aspibaz) are the words which, in Kinnamos' writings and contemporary Byzantine sources denote spears and shields in general meaning; so, it is not possible to determinate from Kinnamos the type of spears and shields that were used by Serbs of twelfth century. Michael of Thessalonica attests Serbian usage of spears and shields in twelfth century, also by terms of general meaning. Kinnamos mentions Serbian usage of sword. The term he uses for sword (xifoz) is the word which in his writings denotes sword in general meaning; because of that, it is not possible from this term to determinate the type of sword which was used by Serbs of twelfth century. But, in one of his orations, N. Choniates uses word romfaia to name sword used by Serbs. Since term romfaia in Byzantine sources usually denotes one-edged sword, and since Choniates calls sword in general meaning by word xifoz, it is reasonable to suppose that some Serbs of twelfth century used one-edged sword. Surprisingly Kinnamos doesn't mention Serbian usage of bow and arrows, although Serbian usage of arrows is known from the previous epochs. This circumstance may be attributed to fragmental character of Kinnamos' data concerning foreign nations, or to Kinnamos' impression that arrows don't play vital role in Serbian warfare.<ref name=Draskovic/>\n*Kinnamos doesn't mention armor among Serbs, but, when talking about battle of Tara (1150) he says that Serbs were well armed using word katafraktoz which usually means 'armored'. Presence of armor among Serbs of twelfth century could be attested by Michael of Thessalonica who mentions Serbs using mail face-coverings, and we know that such mail masks were usually integral part of mail hauberks. Kinnamos mentions Serbian 'hoplites' in fortress of Gali\u010d; since, in Kinnamos writings, term 'hoplite' denotes heavy armed and armored infantryman, this mention of 'hoplite' could also indicate presence of armor among Serbs of twelfth century. Eustathios of Thessalonica also mentions hoplites in Serbian army.<ref name=Draskovic/>\n*Concerning Serbian tactics, Kinnamos also offers interesting fragments. One part of Serbian army fighting in battle of Tara, Kinnamos shows fighting as infantry. Serbian infantry of twelfth century is attested by Eustathios of Thessalonica, but it is important that Eustathios also mentions Serbian cavalry, led by Nemanja. Describing battle of Tara, Kinnamos shows some parts of Serbian army using ambush and sudden strike. Serbian use of ambush is attested by Eustathios of Thessalonica, who mentions Nemanja's ambushes.<ref name=Draskovic/>\n\n===14th century===\n{{see also|Serbian-Ottoman Wars}}\n[[File:Servia1350AD.png|thumb|220px|right|[[Stefan Du\u0161an|Emperor Du\u0161an's]] [[Serbian Empire|Serbia]], ca. 1350]]\nSerbia defeated the [[Second Bulgarian Empire|Bulgarian Empire]] in the [[Battle of Velbazhd]] in 1330, becoming a military superpower during the middle part of the 14th century under the dynamic [[Stephen Uro\u0161 IV Du\u0161an]] (1331\u201355), who created the [[Serbian Empire]]. It included Macedonia, Albania, Epirus and Thessaly, reaching from the Drina and Danube rivers as far south and east as the Gulf of Patras and the Rhodope Mountains by 1350. A large part of this expansion was at the expense of the Byzantine Empire. Du\u0161an set his sights on the Byzantine capital of [[Constantinople]] itself, dividing his lands into 'Serbia' and 'Romania'. Du\u0161an was crowned Emperor (Tsar) of Serbs and [[Romaioi|Romans]] in 1345. He modeled his court on that of Constantinople, calling his officials by Byzantine titles such as caesar, despot, sebastokrator and logotet (logothete). However, following his death, the Serbian Empire gradually disintegrated under his successor [[Stephen Uro\u0161 V]] (1355\u201371).

The Ottomans were met by the forces commanded by Prince Lazar, estimated at between 12000 and 20000 men, which consisted of the prince's own troops, [[Vuk Brankovi\u0107]]'s troops, and a contingent sent by the King [[Tvrtko I of Bosnia]]. In the [[Battle of Kosovo]], both Prince Lazar and Sultan Murad lost their lives. The battle was tactically inconclusive, but the mutual heavy losses were devastating only for the Serbs, who had brought to Kosovo almost all of their fighting strength.

He was fighting against the Ottomans, and later he supported [[Mehmet I]] rise to power in the [[Battle of \u00c7amurlu]].\n\nAfter him the [[Brankovi\u0107 dynasty]] came to power. They continued developing modern military battle tactics. Despot [[\u0110ura\u0111 Brankovi\u0107]] who ruled Serbia from 1427 to 1456, constructed the [[Smederevo Fortress]], which was the largest medieval lowland type of fortress in Europe. This fortress had 24 towers and a citadel with 50m tall towers. Most of the fortress remains intact until nowadays.\n\n== Organization ==\nThe Serbian army was feudal in nature, though its system of military landholding was inherited from the Byzantine pronoia rather than the Western European fief. The pronoia itself - hereditary by some accounts, non-hereditary by others - is only first recorded in [[Serbia]] under that name in 1299 (the Serbs spelt it pronija, or pronya, and called its holder a promjar), but even from as early as [[Stefan Nemanja]] reign (1186\u201396) every able-bodied man possessing a bashtina (a grant of hereditary freehold land, the holder being called a bashtinik or voynici) had been obliged to attend the army whenever required, only monastic tenants being exempted in exchange for performing part-time garrison duties in local fortresses and fortified monasteries. The building and maintenance (gradozadanje) of such fortresses, and equally the maintenance of their permanent garrisons (gradobljudenlje) was an additional aspect of the feudal responsibilities of the population of each \u017dupa (district), who were also responsible for guarding their own frontier. The holders of both bashtinas and pronijas constituted the nobility (though many of the former were only upper-class peasants), and these were the principal native element of every [[Serbian army]], serving as [[heavy cavalry]] (the proniiars) and infantry (the voynici), In fact most armies included only the [[nobility]] (the vlastelini, or 'holders of power') and their retinues, maintained at their own expense, but in times of emergency the arriere-ban, called the Zamanitchka Voyska ('All Together'), would be summoned. As elsewhere, this comprised all the nobility and every able-bodied freeman.\n\nIn border regions all land-grants appear to have been called krayina and their holders vlastele krayishnik ('border lords'), whose duty it was to guard the frontier. [[Du\u0161an's Code]] of 1349 (the Zakonik, extended and completed in 1354) actually states that any damage inflicted by an invading army had to be compensated for by the border-lord through whose lands the enemy had entered, another article stating that similar pillaging committed by brigands had to be repaid seven-fold. The Byzantine chronicler [[Nicephorus Gregoras|Gregoras]], as ambassador for [[Andronikos III Palaiologos|Andronikos III]] to [[Emperor Dusan]], encountered some krayishnici (men of a border- lord) on crossing the frontier. He wrote: 'When we passed the Struma River ... and came into thick woods, we were suddenly surrounded by men clad in black woolen garments, who darted forth from behind trees and rocks like devils out of the earth. They wore no heavy armor, being armed only with spears, battle-axes, and bows and arrows.\n\nFrom the 11th century on the commander-in-chief of the army was the king (kral), a veliki vojevoda or 'high military chief, equivalent to the Byzantine Grand Domestic, being appointed in his absence. However, since any call to arms had to be approved by the Sabor (the National Assembly) the king actually had limited military power, in effect being no more than a glorified Grand \u017dupan, or elected tribal leader. Although Du\u0161an stripped the Sabor of much of its power, the crown's dependence on a permanent nucleus of mercenaries that was not subject to the assembly's whims had by then already evolved, constituting the core of all Serbian armies throughout this period. Under [[Stephen Uro\u0161 II Milutin]] (1282-1321) these mercenaries included such diverse elements as [[Cumans]]; [[Anatolian Turks]] (some 1,500 were employed in 1311 from amongst those who had been allied to the [[Catalan people|Catalans]] in [[Thrace]] and [[Macedonia (region)|Macedonia]]); [[Tartars]] from South Russia; and Christian [[Ossetians]] (Jasi in Serbian and Russian sources) from the Caucasus. However, it was Western European style [[heavy cavalry]] which soon came to predominate. As early as 1304 a certain Francisco de Salomone is mentioned in an inscription in Trevise as having distinguished himself in the service of 'Orosius, rex Rascie' (i. e. Uro\u0161, king of Serbia). Mercenaries in [[Stephen Uro\u0161 III]]'s army that defeated the Bulgarians at [[Battle of Velbazhd]] in 1330 were 1,500 [[Aragonese people|Aragonese]], [[Spaniards]], and [[Germans]], and it was the latter who seem to have predominated during Du\u0161an reign. The papal legate to his court reported seeing 300 German mercenaries there under the knight [[Palman]] Bracht, who held the rank of capitaneus. In addition we know that the Serbian troops supplied to the Byzantine Emperor, [[John VI Kantakouzenos]], in 1342-43 were Germans, and that the troops garrisoning Beroia in Macedonia in 1341-50 were German mercenaries too. Even at the [[Battle of Kosovo]] in 1389 it is significant that many of Lazar men were German and Hungarian mercenaries according to a Florentine account, while a mid-15th century Ottoman source reports that his army included Wallachians, Hungarians, Bohemians, Albanians, Bulgarians and Franks, doubtless chiefly mercenaries. Another says he employed many mercenaries from among the Serbians themselves as well as the Hungarians, Bosnians and Albanians. Serbian documents indicate that as well as Germans the other predominant European mercenary elements comprised Spaniards (possibly as many as 1,300-strong at one point) plus Hungarians, Frenchmen, [[Italians]] and [[Swiss]]. One prominent name to appear in their ranks was that of [[Philippe de M\u00e9zi\u00e8res]], in later life Chancellor of Cyprus and one of the last protagonists of the [[Crusade]]. Inevitably, in the 15th century Ottoman auxiliaries were also used, for example by Vuk Lazarevi\u0107 against Stephen, 1409-13. In addition to the king or despot, the larger cities also employed some mercenaries of their own to back up their militia.\n\nWhen the Ottoman hold on Serbia weakened after the [[Battle of Ankara]], [[Stefan Lazarevi\u0107]] took advantage of the situation to establish his independence from the Turks. Recognizing the king of Hungary as his overlord he built up a small regular army, on the basis of a newly imposed levy known as the vojstatik, which was stationed in the country's 11 major fortresses as well as several of its small walled towns. This army included many Hungarians and was well equipped with cannon and handguns; for example, there were 2 cannons in the fort guarding the large silver mine at [[Srebrnica, Serbia|Srebrnica]] in 1425, and in [[Belgrade]], Lazarevi\u0107 capital, there was a large bombard (called Humka, meaning 'Knoll') captured from the Bosnians the same year. In 1455 there were as many as 3 large cannon, 5 other guns and 55 handguns in the fort guarding the great silver mine at [[Novo Brdo]].\n\n== Field-armies ==\n[[File:Serbian medieval army equipment.jpg|thumb|Serbian medieval army equipment (Military museum Belgrade)]]\n\nSerbian armies were composed of [[lance]]-armed light and heavy cavalry, plus infantry (armed with [[spear]]s, [[axe]]s, and above all bows and, later, [[crossbows]]) and a baggage-train (''komora'') manned by shepherds (\"Vlachs\").{{citation needed|date=April 2016}} Most of their armies tended to be small because of the difficulties involved in supplying them in the field, and on the whole they could probably raise only about 12,000 men in the late 14th-century, the army at the [[Battle of Kosovo]] probably numbering at most 20-25,000 men including allied contingents. The majority were [[heavy cavalry]]. Emperor [[Stefan Du\u0161an]] was said to have raised around 80,000 men for the invasion of Bosnia in 1350 although the largest Serbian army on record in this period was that raised by Du\u0161an in 1355 for his proposed attack on Constantinople, which numbered 85,000 men according to later Ragusan chronicles. Modern scholars, however, give this figure little credence.\n\nAfter the [[Battle of Maritsa]] in 1371, Ottoman suzerainty was accepted by the Serbian rulers in Macedonia: [[Prince Marko|King Marko]] (Vuka\u0161in Mrnjav\u010devi\u0107's son), [[Konstantin Draga\u0161]], and [[Radoslav Hlapen]].<ref name=mihaljcic78-115>Mihalj\u010di\u0107 2001, pp. 78\u2013115</ref> By 1388, [[Djuradj Stracimirovi\u0107 Bal\u0161i\u0107]], the lord of [[Zeta (state)|Zeta]], also became an Ottoman vassal.<ref name=Fine392-3>Fine 1994, pp. 392\u20133</ref> Stefan Lazarevi\u0107 and Vuk Brankovi\u0107 accepted Ottoman suzerainty in 1390 and 1392, respectively.<ref name=Fine409-14/> [[Stefan Lazarevi\u0107]] ceased to be an Ottoman vassal and ally in 1402, when he became a despot and created the [[Serbian Despotate]].<ref name=fine500>Fine 1994, p. 500</ref> According to Serbian historiography, Stefan from 1390 on, was obliged to pay an annual tribute of 1,000&nbsp;lbs of gold and to provide the sultan with a contingent of 1,000 cavalry when called upon. Finlay and Creasy, however, maintained that it was the treaty of 1376 that first imposed this obligation, while Gibbons says 1386; certainly there were Serbs as well as Bulgarians and Byzantines in the Ottoman army that fought against the Karamanli Turks in Anatolia in 1387 (the Serbs being promised booty in return for their services). Finlay says in one of his books that Sultan Beyazid actually demanded the service of the same number of Serbians as the Byzantines had called for after Manuel's subjugation of Serbia in 1150, i.e. 2,000 to armies serving in Europe and 500 to armies serving in Asia; but in another book he says that the figure was only 'subsequently increased to 2,000 men' when Beyazid was gathering his forces to confront Tamerlane in 1402. Bertrandon de la Brocqui\u00e8re, in his 'Travels' of 1432-33, recorded of the despot of Serbia that 'every time the sultan sends him his orders, he is obliged to furnish him with 800 or 1,000 horse, under the command of his second son.' Elsewhere he adds how he had heard that 'in the most recent army [supplied to the sultan] from Greece, there were 3,000 Serbian horse, which the despot of the province had sent under the command of one of his sons. It was with great regret that these people came to serve him, but they dared not refuse.' Konstantin Mihailovi\u0107 reports that when the treaty with Serbia was renewed under Mehmed II the obligatory tribute was set at 1,500&nbsp;lbs of gold and a contingent of 1,500 cavalry.\n\nAmongst the battles in which Serbs fought for their Ottoman allies were [[Battle of Rovine]], against the [[Wallachia]]ns and [[Bulgaria]]ns, in 1395; [[Battle of Nicopolis]] in 1396, where apparently their contingent comprised 5,000  [[heavy cavalry]]; and [[Battle of Ankara]] in 1402, where Doukas says there were 5,000 \"encased in black armor\" and Chalkokondyles that there were an unlikely 10,000 (though the Ottoman chronicler al-Anwari says that there were 10,000 Serbs and Wallachians altogether). George Brankovi\u0107 even supplied an unwilling contingent of 1,500 cavalry under voivode [[Jak\u0161a]] according to [[Konstantin Mihailovi\u0107]], for the final siege of Constantinople in 1453, plus some silver-miners from [[Novo Brdo]] whom Sultan Mehmed employed as sappers. On August 11, 1473, the army that marched against Uzun Hasan which resulted in an Ottoman victory in The battle of Otlukbeli included many Christians - Greeks, Albanians and Serbians, in their number.\n\n== Weapons and armour ==\nPrior to the 14th century the army consisted of [[Byzantine]]-style noble cavalry armed with [[bow and arrow|bows]] and [[lances]] (replaced with crossbows in the 14th century) and infantry armed with [[spear]]s, javelins and bows.\n\n== Artillery ==\nSerbia had adopted gunpowder artillery from the [[Republic of Ragusa]], where a centre for the manufacture of wrought-iron cannon existed by 1363. The first gun foundry in the Balkans, casting bronze cannons, was also established at Ragusa ([[Dubrovnik]]), in 1410. Neighbouring Bosnia had cannon by 1380, and they were in use in Serbia by 1382\u201386 at the very latest, probably served and certainly made by Ragusan engineers. In fact, Ragusan chronicler [[Mavro Orbini]] (1563\u20131614) claims that ''knez'' [[Lazar Hrebeljanovi\u0107]] used guns against ''\u017eupan'' [[Nikola Altomanovi\u0107]] even as early as 1373. Guns were apparently employed in the field by the Serbians as early as 1389 at the [[Battle of Kosovo]], being clearly mentioned in one later Ottoman chronicle ([[Mehmed Ne\u015fr\u00ee]]) and alluded to in a contemporary Serbian source which says that 'fiery explosions thundered, the earth roared greatly, and the air echoed and blew around like dark smoke'; we know too that King Tvrtko of Bosnia (1353\u201391) brought one gun, a gift of the Italians, with him to the battle. The Serbian contingent in the Ottoman army defeated at Ankara in 1402 also had artillery, but as at Kosovo it failed to affect the outcome, probably for the same reasons on both occasions - i.e. the guns were too small to be effective in order that they might be maneuverable on the battlefield. In siege work [[trebuchet]]s and [[ballista]]e remained in service alongside gunpowder artillery for a long time.\n\n== Navy ==\nIn addition to her land forces, Serbia occasionally also had a very small fleet, provided by the communes of Dulcigno (modern Ulcinj), Budua (Budva) and Cattaro (Kotor), sometimes by Ragusa (in exchange for a year's tax-exemption), and briefly by Venice (which provided 4 new galleys, the galee domini imperatoris, in 1350, the subsequent fate of which is unknown). King Tvrtko of Bosnia too later constructed his own small fleet, with a Venetian as its admiral, and was similarly given a galley by Venice, this time fitted with a cannon.\n\n==Cavalry==\n\n===Gusars, Hussars===\n{{see also|Hussars}}\nGusar light cavalry forces were part of the medieval [[Military of Serbia|Serbian military]]. Armed with spears and pentagonal wood shields padded with metal, they supported the noble knights as their second line on the battlefield.<ref>[http://www.balkanhistory.com/serbian_medieval.htm Balkanhistory.com]</ref> In the middle of each wooden shield, there was a round metal knob that held the shield together.\n\nGusar light cavalries were a traditional Serbian force, which meant that they usually were not hired as mercenaries from Spain or Germany. Their style of fighting was similar to the noble knights. They used the eastern style of fighting: they would charge into the enemy ferociously, and try to cause mass havoc. As for their role with the foot soldiers, they were more like support cavalry. When the foot soldiers were losing the battle, the Gusars would charge into the enemy's flank, hoping to cause them to rout. They would repeat this charge from different angles while the infantry kept the enemy from chasing the Gusars.\n\nLater on, after the fall of the [[Serbian Empire]], these troops were used as \"Kraji\u0161niks\" meaning frontiersman in the Habsburg Monarchy (today Croatia, Slavonia, Vojvodina) which southern parts became the [[Military Frontier|military frontier]], defending and liberating as they believed [[Christendom]] from the Ottoman invasion. Their military tactics of engaging combat, as well as pillaging and looting of Ottoman ruled territories, were similar to the ones of the [[Cossack|Cossacks]].\n\nAccording to [[Webster's]] the word ''hussar'' stems from the Hungarian ''husz\u00e1r,'' which in turn originates from the [[Serbian language|Serbian]] ''\u0445\u0443\u0441\u0430\u0440'' (''Husar'', or ''\u0433\u0443\u0441\u0430\u0440'', ''Gusar'') meaning [[Piracy|pirate]], from the Medieval Latin ''cursarius'' (cf. the English word ''[[Privateer|corsair]]'').<ref>{{cite encyclopedia | editor = [[Philip Babcock Gove]] | encyclopedia = [[Webster's Third New International Dictionary]] | title = Hussar | year = 1986 | publisher = [[Merriam-Webster]] | volume = 2 | location = [[Springfield, Massachusetts]] | isbn = 0-85229-503-0 | pages = Page 1105}}</ref> A variant of this theory is offered by Byzantinist scholars, who argue the term originated in Roman military practice, and the ''cursarii'' (singular ''cursarius'').<ref>George T.

Prior to the 14th century the army consisted of [[Byzantine]]-style noble cavalry armed with [[bow and arrow|bows]] and [[lances]] (replaced with crossbows in the 14th century) and infantry armed with [[spear]]s, javelins and bows. With the economic growth from mining, mercenary knights from Western Europe were recruited to finalize and increase the effectiveness of the army, especially throughout 14th century.\n\n== History ==\n{{main|Serbia in the Middle Ages}}\n\n===Early===\n{{see also|9th century in Serbia|10th century in Serbia}}\n[[File:BMM-WeaponsOfRa\u0161kaAndZetaInMiddleAges1.JPG|thumb|Axes dating to the 9th century.]]\nBetween 839 and 842 the Bulgar Khan [[Presian I of Bulgaria|Presian]] invaded inland parts of the Serbian territory, the two having lived peacefully sharing a common frontier up until that point. The cause for the invasion is unclear. It led to a war that lasted three years, in which the Bulgars were decisively defeated. In the mid 850s the Bulgarians under [[Boris I of Bulgaria|Boris I]] made another unsuccessful attempt to subdue the Serbs. In the beginning of the 10th century [[Simeon I of Bulgaria|Simeon I]] launched several campaigns against the Serbs who were acting as Byzantine allies and by 925 he managed to conquer Serbia completely but the Bulgarian rule was short-lived.

The terms he uses for these weapons (borata and aspibaz) are the words which, in Kinnamos' writings and contemporary Byzantine sources denote spears and shields in general meaning; so, it is not possible to determinate from Kinnamos the type of spears and shields that were used by Serbs of twelfth century. Michael of Thessalonica attests Serbian usage of spears and shields in twelfth century, also by terms of general meaning. Kinnamos mentions Serbian usage of sword. The term he uses for sword (xifoz) is the word which in his writings denotes sword in general meaning; because of that, it is not possible from this term to determinate the type of sword which was used by Serbs of twelfth century. But, in one of his orations, N. Choniates uses word romfaia to name sword used by Serbs. Since term romfaia in Byzantine sources usually denotes one-edged sword, and since Choniates calls sword in general meaning by word xifoz, it is reasonable to suppose that some Serbs of twelfth century used one-edged sword. Surprisingly Kinnamos doesn't mention Serbian usage of bow and arrows, although Serbian usage of arrows is known from the previous epochs. This circumstance may be attributed to fragmental character of Kinnamos' data concerning foreign nations, or to Kinnamos' impression that arrows don't play vital role in Serbian warfare.<ref name=Draskovic/>\n*Kinnamos doesn't mention armor among Serbs, but, when talking about battle of Tara (1150) he says that Serbs were well armed using word katafraktoz which usually means 'armored'. Presence of armor among Serbs of twelfth century could be attested by Michael of Thessalonica who mentions Serbs using mail face-coverings, and we know that such mail masks were usually integral part of mail hauberks. Kinnamos mentions Serbian 'hoplites' in fortress of Gali\u010d; since, in Kinnamos writings, term 'hoplite' denotes heavy armed and armored infantryman, this mention of 'hoplite' could also indicate presence of armor among Serbs of twelfth century. Eustathios of Thessalonica also mentions hoplites in Serbian army.<ref name=Draskovic/>\n*Concerning Serbian tactics, Kinnamos also offers interesting fragments. One part of Serbian army fighting in battle of Tara, Kinnamos shows fighting as infantry. Serbian infantry of twelfth century is attested by Eustathios of Thessalonica, but it is important that Eustathios also mentions Serbian cavalry, led by Nemanja. Describing battle of Tara, Kinnamos shows some parts of Serbian army using ambush and sudden strike. Serbian use of ambush is attested by Eustathios of Thessalonica, who mentions Nemanja's ambushes.<ref name=Draskovic/>\n\n===14th century===\n{{see also|Serbian-Ottoman Wars}}\n[[File:Servia1350AD.png|thumb|220px|right|[[Stefan Du\u0161an|Emperor Du\u0161an's]] [[Serbian Empire|Serbia]], ca. 1350]]\nSerbia defeated the [[Second Bulgarian Empire|Bulgarian Empire]] in the [[Battle of Velbazhd]] in 1330, becoming a military superpower during the middle part of the 14th century under the dynamic [[Stephen Uro\u0161 IV Du\u0161an]] (1331\u201355), who created the [[Serbian Empire]]. It included Macedonia, Albania, Epirus and Thessaly, reaching from the Drina and Danube rivers as far south and east as the Gulf of Patras and the Rhodope Mountains by 1350. A large part of this expansion was at the expense of the Byzantine Empire. Du\u0161an set his sights on the Byzantine capital of [[Constantinople]] itself, dividing his lands into 'Serbia' and 'Romania'. Du\u0161an was crowned Emperor (Tsar) of Serbs and [[Romaioi|Romans]] in 1345. He modeled his court on that of Constantinople, calling his officials by Byzantine titles such as caesar, despot, sebastokrator and logotet (logothete). However, following his death, the Serbian Empire gradually disintegrated under his successor [[Stephen Uro\u0161 V]] (1355\u201371). One Byzantine chronicler noted with evident satisfaction that the [[Serbian nobility]] were soon divided into '10,000 factions', while John VI Kantakouzenos wrote that Du\u0161an's empire fell 'into a thousand pieces'.\n\nAfter 1363, [[Vuka\u0161in Mrnjav\u010devi\u0107]] became the most powerful noble in the [[Serbian Empire]]; he controlled lands in the south of the empire, primarily in [[Macedonia (region)|Macedonia]].<ref name=mihaljcic29-52>Mihalj\u010di\u0107 2001, pp. 29\u201352</ref> He was defeated and killed by the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman Turks]] in 1371 in the [[Battle of Marica]].<ref name=Fine379>Fine 1994, p. 379</ref> In 1373, Prince [[Lazar Hrebeljanovi\u0107]] emerged as the most powerful Serbian lord.

In the [[Battle of Kosovo]], both Prince Lazar and Sultan Murad lost their lives. The battle was tactically inconclusive, but the mutual heavy losses were devastating only for the Serbs, who had brought to Kosovo almost all of their fighting strength.

He was fighting against the Ottomans, and later he supported [[Mehmet I]] rise to power in the [[Battle of \u00c7amurlu]].\n\nAfter him the [[Brankovi\u0107 dynasty]] came to power. They continued developing modern military battle tactics. Despot [[\u0110ura\u0111 Brankovi\u0107]] who ruled Serbia from 1427 to 1456, constructed the [[Smederevo Fortress]], which was the largest medieval lowland type of fortress in Europe. This fortress had 24 towers and a citadel with 50m tall towers. Most of the fortress remains intact until nowadays.\n\n== Organization ==\nThe Serbian army was feudal in nature, though its system of military landholding was inherited from the Byzantine pronoia rather than the Western European fief. The pronoia itself - hereditary by some accounts, non-hereditary by others - is only first recorded in [[Serbia]] under that name in 1299 (the Serbs spelt it pronija, or pronya, and called its holder a promjar), but even from as early as [[Stefan Nemanja]] reign (1186\u201396) every able-bodied man possessing a bashtina (a grant of hereditary freehold land, the holder being called a bashtinik or voynici) had been obliged to attend the army whenever required, only monastic tenants being exempted in exchange for performing part-time garrison duties in local fortresses and fortified monasteries. The building and maintenance (gradozadanje) of such fortresses, and equally the maintenance of their permanent garrisons (gradobljudenlje) was an additional aspect of the feudal responsibilities of the population of each \u017dupa (district), who were also responsible for guarding their own frontier. The holders of both bashtinas and pronijas constituted the nobility (though many of the former were only upper-class peasants), and these were the principal native element of every [[Serbian army]], serving as [[heavy cavalry]] (the proniiars) and infantry (the voynici), In fact most armies included only the [[nobility]] (the vlastelini, or 'holders of power') and their retinues, maintained at their own expense, but in times of emergency the arriere-ban, called the Zamanitchka Voyska ('All Together'), would be summoned. As elsewhere, this comprised all the nobility and every able-bodied freeman.\n\nIn border regions all land-grants appear to have been called krayina and their holders vlastele krayishnik ('border lords'), whose duty it was to guard the frontier. [[Du\u0161an's Code]] of 1349 (the Zakonik, extended and completed in 1354) actually states that any damage inflicted by an invading army had to be compensated for by the border-lord through whose lands the enemy had entered, another article stating that similar pillaging committed by brigands had to be repaid seven-fold. The Byzantine chronicler [[Nicephorus Gregoras|Gregoras]], as ambassador for [[Andronikos III Palaiologos|Andronikos III]] to [[Emperor Dusan]], encountered some krayishnici (men of a border- lord) on crossing the frontier. He wrote: 'When we passed the Struma River ... and came into thick woods, we were suddenly surrounded by men clad in black woolen garments, who darted forth from behind trees and rocks like devils out of the earth. They wore no heavy armor, being armed only with spears, battle-axes, and bows and arrows.\n\nFrom the 11th century on the commander-in-chief of the army was the king (kral), a veliki vojevoda or 'high military chief, equivalent to the Byzantine Grand Domestic, being appointed in his absence. However, since any call to arms had to be approved by the Sabor (the National Assembly) the king actually had limited military power, in effect being no more than a glorified Grand \u017dupan, or elected tribal leader. Although Du\u0161an stripped the Sabor of much of its power, the crown's dependence on a permanent nucleus of mercenaries that was not subject to the assembly's whims had by then already evolved, constituting the core of all Serbian armies throughout this period. Under [[Stephen Uro\u0161 II Milutin]] (1282-1321) these mercenaries included such diverse elements as [[Cumans]]; [[Anatolian Turks]] (some 1,500 were employed in 1311 from amongst those who had been allied to the [[Catalan people|Catalans]] in [[Thrace]] and [[Macedonia (region)|Macedonia]]); [[Tartars]] from South Russia; and Christian [[Ossetians]] (Jasi in Serbian and Russian sources) from the Caucasus. However, it was Western European style [[heavy cavalry]] which soon came to predominate. As early as 1304 a certain Francisco de Salomone is mentioned in an inscription in Trevise as having distinguished himself in the service of 'Orosius, rex Rascie' (i. e. Uro\u0161, king of Serbia). Mercenaries in [[Stephen Uro\u0161 III]]'s army that defeated the Bulgarians at [[Battle of Velbazhd]] in 1330 were 1,500 [[Aragonese people|Aragonese]], [[Spaniards]], and [[Germans]], and it was the latter who seem to have predominated during Du\u0161an reign. The papal legate to his court reported seeing 300 German mercenaries there under the knight [[Palman]] Bracht, who held the rank of capitaneus. In addition we know that the Serbian troops supplied to the Byzantine Emperor, [[John VI Kantakouzenos]], in 1342-43 were Germans, and that the troops garrisoning Beroia in Macedonia in 1341-50 were German mercenaries too. Even at the [[Battle of Kosovo]] in 1389 it is significant that many of Lazar men were German and Hungarian mercenaries according to a Florentine account, while a mid-15th century Ottoman source reports that his army included Wallachians, Hungarians, Bohemians, Albanians, Bulgarians and Franks, doubtless chiefly mercenaries. Another says he employed many mercenaries from among the Serbians themselves as well as the Hungarians, Bosnians and Albanians. Serbian documents indicate that as well as Germans the other predominant European mercenary elements comprised Spaniards (possibly as many as 1,300-strong at one point) plus Hungarians, Frenchmen, [[Italians]] and [[Swiss]]. One prominent name to appear in their ranks was that of [[Philippe de M\u00e9zi\u00e8res]], in later life Chancellor of Cyprus and one of the last protagonists of the [[Crusade]]. Inevitably, in the 15th century Ottoman auxiliaries were also used, for example by Vuk Lazarevi\u0107 against Stephen, 1409-13. In addition to the king or despot, the larger cities also employed some mercenaries of their own to back up their militia.\n\nWhen the Ottoman hold on Serbia weakened after the [[Battle of Ankara]], [[Stefan Lazarevi\u0107]] took advantage of the situation to establish his independence from the Turks. Recognizing the king of Hungary as his overlord he built up a small regular army, on the basis of a newly imposed levy known as the vojstatik, which was stationed in the country's 11 major fortresses as well as several of its small walled towns. This army included many Hungarians and was well equipped with cannon and handguns; for example, there were 2 cannons in the fort guarding the large silver mine at [[Srebrnica, Serbia|Srebrnica]] in 1425, and in [[Belgrade]], Lazarevi\u0107 capital, there was a large bombard (called Humka, meaning 'Knoll') captured from the Bosnians the same year. In 1455 there were as many as 3 large cannon, 5 other guns and 55 handguns in the fort guarding the great silver mine at [[Novo Brdo]].\n\n== Field-armies ==\n[[File:Serbian medieval army equipment.jpg|thumb|Serbian medieval army equipment (Military museum Belgrade)]]\n\nSerbian armies were composed of [[lance]]-armed light and heavy cavalry, plus infantry (armed with [[spear]]s, [[axe]]s, and above all bows and, later, [[crossbows]]) and a baggage-train (''komora'') manned by shepherds (\"Vlachs\").{{citation needed|date=April 2016}} Most of their armies tended to be small because of the difficulties involved in supplying them in the field, and on the whole they could probably raise only about 12,000 men in the late 14th-century, the army at the [[Battle of Kosovo]] probably numbering at most 20-25,000 men including allied contingents. The majority were [[heavy cavalry]]. Emperor [[Stefan Du\u0161an]] was said to have raised around 80,000 men for the invasion of Bosnia in 1350 although the largest Serbian army on record in this period was that raised by Du\u0161an in 1355 for his proposed attack on Constantinople, which numbered 85,000 men according to later Ragusan chronicles. Modern scholars, however, give this figure little credence.\n\nAfter the [[Battle of Maritsa]] in 1371, Ottoman suzerainty was accepted by the Serbian rulers in Macedonia: [[Prince Marko|King Marko]] (Vuka\u0161in Mrnjav\u010devi\u0107's son), [[Konstantin Draga\u0161]], and [[Radoslav Hlapen]].<ref name=mihaljcic78-115>Mihalj\u010di\u0107 2001, pp. 78\u2013115</ref> By 1388, [[Djuradj Stracimirovi\u0107 Bal\u0161i\u0107]], the lord of [[Zeta (state)|Zeta]], also became an Ottoman vassal.<ref name=Fine392-3>Fine 1994, pp. 392\u20133</ref> Stefan Lazarevi\u0107 and Vuk Brankovi\u0107 accepted Ottoman suzerainty in 1390 and 1392, respectively.<ref name=Fine409-14/> [[Stefan Lazarevi\u0107]] ceased to be an Ottoman vassal and ally in 1402, when he became a despot and created the [[Serbian Despotate]].<ref name=fine500>Fine 1994, p. 500</ref> According to Serbian historiography, Stefan from 1390 on, was obliged to pay an annual tribute of 1,000&nbsp;lbs of gold and to provide the sultan with a contingent of 1,000 cavalry when called upon. Finlay and Creasy, however, maintained that it was the treaty of 1376 that first imposed this obligation, while Gibbons says 1386; certainly there were Serbs as well as Bulgarians and Byzantines in the Ottoman army that fought against the Karamanli Turks in Anatolia in 1387 (the Serbs being promised booty in return for their services). Finlay says in one of his books that Sultan Beyazid actually demanded the service of the same number of Serbians as the Byzantines had called for after Manuel's subjugation of Serbia in 1150, i.e. 2,000 to armies serving in Europe and 500 to armies serving in Asia; but in another book he says that the figure was only 'subsequently increased to 2,000 men' when Beyazid was gathering his forces to confront Tamerlane in 1402. Bertrandon de la Brocqui\u00e8re, in his 'Travels' of 1432-33, recorded of the despot of Serbia that 'every time the sultan sends him his orders, he is obliged to furnish him with 800 or 1,000 horse, under the command of his second son.' Elsewhere he adds how he had heard that 'in the most recent army [supplied to the sultan] from Greece, there were 3,000 Serbian horse, which the despot of the province had sent under the command of one of his sons. It was with great regret that these people came to serve him, but they dared not refuse.' Konstantin Mihailovi\u0107 reports that when the treaty with Serbia was renewed under Mehmed II the obligatory tribute was set at 1,500&nbsp;lbs of gold and a contingent of 1,500 cavalry.\n\nAmongst the battles in which Serbs fought for their Ottoman allies were [[Battle of Rovine]], against the [[Wallachia]]ns and [[Bulgaria]]ns, in 1395; [[Battle of Nicopolis]] in 1396, where apparently their contingent comprised 5,000  [[heavy cavalry]]; and [[Battle of Ankara]] in 1402, where Doukas says there were 5,000 \"encased in black armor\" and Chalkokondyles that there were an unlikely 10,000 (though the Ottoman chronicler al-Anwari says that there were 10,000 Serbs and Wallachians altogether). George Brankovi\u0107 even supplied an unwilling contingent of 1,500 cavalry under voivode [[Jak\u0161a]] according to [[Konstantin Mihailovi\u0107]], for the final siege of Constantinople in 1453, plus some silver-miners from [[Novo Brdo]] whom Sultan Mehmed employed as sappers. On August 11, 1473, the army that marched against Uzun Hasan which resulted in an Ottoman victory in The battle of Otlukbeli included many Christians - Greeks, Albanians and Serbians, in their number.\n\n== Weapons and armour ==\nPrior to the 14th century the army consisted of [[Byzantine]]-style noble cavalry armed with [[bow and arrow|bows]] and [[lances]] (replaced with crossbows in the 14th century) and infantry armed with [[spear]]s, javelins and bows.\n\n== Artillery ==\nSerbia had adopted gunpowder artillery from the [[Republic of Ragusa]], where a centre for the manufacture of wrought-iron cannon existed by 1363. The first gun foundry in the Balkans, casting bronze cannons, was also established at Ragusa ([[Dubrovnik]]), in 1410. Neighbouring Bosnia had cannon by 1380, and they were in use in Serbia by 1382\u201386 at the very latest, probably served and certainly made by Ragusan engineers. In fact, Ragusan chronicler [[Mavro Orbini]] (1563\u20131614) claims that ''knez'' [[Lazar Hrebeljanovi\u0107]] used guns against ''\u017eupan'' [[Nikola Altomanovi\u0107]] even as early as 1373. Guns were apparently employed in the field by the Serbians as early as 1389 at the [[Battle of Kosovo]], being clearly mentioned in one later Ottoman chronicle ([[Mehmed Ne\u015fr\u00ee]]) and alluded to in a contemporary Serbian source which says that 'fiery explosions thundered, the earth roared greatly, and the air echoed and blew around like dark smoke'; we know too that King Tvrtko of Bosnia (1353\u201391) brought one gun, a gift of the Italians, with him to the battle. The Serbian contingent in the Ottoman army defeated at Ankara in 1402 also had artillery, but as at Kosovo it failed to affect the outcome, probably for the same reasons on both occasions - i.e. the guns were too small to be effective in order that they might be maneuverable on the battlefield. In siege work [[trebuchet]]s and [[ballista]]e remained in service alongside gunpowder artillery for a long time.\n\n== Navy ==\nIn addition to her land forces, Serbia occasionally also had a very small fleet, provided by the communes of Dulcigno (modern Ulcinj), Budua (Budva) and Cattaro (Kotor), sometimes by Ragusa (in exchange for a year's tax-exemption), and briefly by Venice (which provided 4 new galleys, the galee domini imperatoris, in 1350, the subsequent fate of which is unknown). King Tvrtko of Bosnia too later constructed his own small fleet, with a Venetian as its admiral, and was similarly given a galley by Venice, this time fitted with a cannon.\n\n==Cavalry==\n\n===Gusars, Hussars===\n{{see also|Hussars}}\nGusar light cavalry forces were part of the medieval [[Military of Serbia|Serbian military]]. Armed with spears and pentagonal wood shields padded with metal, they supported the noble knights as their second line on the battlefield.<ref>[http://www.balkanhistory.com/serbian_medieval.htm Balkanhistory.com]</ref> In the middle of each wooden shield, there was a round metal knob that held the shield together.\n\nGusar light cavalries were a traditional Serbian force, which meant that they usually were not hired as mercenaries from Spain or Germany. Their style of fighting was similar to the noble knights. They used the eastern style of fighting: they would charge into the enemy ferociously, and try to cause mass havoc. As for their role with the foot soldiers, they were more like support cavalry. When the foot soldiers were losing the battle, the Gusars would charge into the enemy's flank, hoping to cause them to rout. They would repeat this charge from different angles while the infantry kept the enemy from chasing the Gusars.\n\nLater on, after the fall of the [[Serbian Empire]], these troops were used as \"Kraji\u0161niks\" meaning frontiersman in the Habsburg Monarchy (today Croatia, Slavonia, Vojvodina) which southern parts became the [[Military Frontier|military frontier]], defending and liberating as they believed [[Christendom]] from the Ottoman invasion. Their military tactics of engaging combat, as well as pillaging and looting of Ottoman ruled territories, were similar to the ones of the [[Cossack|Cossacks]].\n\nAccording to [[Webster's]] the word ''hussar'' stems from the Hungarian ''husz\u00e1r,'' which in turn originates from the [[Serbian language|Serbian]] ''\u0445\u0443\u0441\u0430\u0440'' (''Husar'', or ''\u0433\u0443\u0441\u0430\u0440'', ''Gusar'') meaning [[Piracy|pirate]], from the Medieval Latin ''cursarius'' (cf. the English word ''[[Privateer|corsair]]'').<ref>{{cite encyclopedia | editor = [[Philip Babcock Gove]] | encyclopedia = [[Webster's Third New International Dictionary]] | title = Hussar | year = 1986 | publisher = [[Merriam-Webster]] | volume = 2 | location = [[Springfield, Massachusetts]] | isbn = 0-85229-503-0 | pages = Page 1105}}</ref> A variant of this theory is offered by Byzantinist scholars, who argue the term originated in Roman military practice, and the ''cursarii'' (singular ''cursarius'').<ref>George T.
