After completing the occupation, [[Kingdom of Cochin]], situated south of Malabar, was made a tributary state of Mysore. The major reason for the occupation of Malabar was the desire to have access to  Indian Ocean ports. The Mysore invasion provided the [[English East India Company]] more chances to tighten their grip on the ancient feudal principalities of Malabar and converting [[Travancore]], over whom Mysore Sultans attacked after Cochin, to a mere protected ally<ref name=\"kerala.gov.in\">{{cite web |url=http://www.kerala.gov.in/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=2852&Itemid=2291 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-06-08 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121009144939/http://kerala.gov.in/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=2852&Itemid=2291 |archivedate=9 October 2012 |df=dmy-all }} www.kerala.gov.in History</ref>\n\nBy the 18th century, all the petty kingdoms of present-day [[Kerala]] had been absorbed or subordinated by three big states of [[Travancore]], [[Zamorin|Calicut (ruled by Zamorins)]] and [[Kingdom of Cochin|Cochin]]. [[Kingdom of Mysore]], nominally ruled by the [[Wodeyar]] family, rose to prominence in India after the decline of the [[Vijayanagara Empire]] and again after [[Mughal empire]]. In 1761, [[Hyder Ali]] seized control of all of the reins of power in Mysore by overthrowing a powerful minister and became the \"de facto\" head of Mysore Kingdom. He turned his attention towards expansion which included the capture of the Kingdoms of Bednur (Ikkeri or Keladi<ref>[http://princelystatesofindia.com/Extinguished/bednur.html Kingdom of Bednur]</ref>), Sunda, Sera, and Canara. In 1766, he descended into Malabar and occupied the Kingdoms of Chirakkal (former [[Kolathunad]]), Kottayam, [[Kadathanad]], Calicut, [[Valluvanad (southern Malabar)|Valluvanad]] and Palghat and King of [[Kingdom of Cochin|Cochin]] accepted his suzerainty and paid him tribute annually for from 1766{{Citation needed|date=January 2012}} till 1790. [[Feroke|Faruqabad]], near Calicut, was the local capital of the Mysore-ruled area of present-day [[Kerala]].\n\nHyder Ali's attempt to defeat [[Travancore]], a British ally state<ref name=\"Tippu Sultan 2011\">\"Tippu Sultan.\" Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica.

Moreover, Tipu Sultan provoked British invasion in the form of [[Third Anglo-Mysore War]] by attacking the Kingdom of Travancore.<ref name=\"Tippu Sultan 2011\"/> Thus [[Travancore]] was the only part of present-day [[Kerala]] that stood outside the Muslim Mysore authority.<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=ezW2AAAAIAAJ Journal of Indian history, Volume 55 By University of Allahabad.

By 1801, the [[Madras Presidency]] was created by [[Richard Wellesley, 1st Marquess Wellesley|Lord Wellesley]], by attaching Malabar along with Carnatic territories seized from Mysore. Travancore was asked by the Company to meet the entire expenditure of the Third Anglo-Mysore war on the plea that the war was undertaken in defence of Travancore. The new treaty of 1795 reduced Travancore from a friend and ally of the English East India Company to that of a protected ally. The King was forced to entertain a subsidiary force far beyond his capacity to subsidise. The Company also claimed a monopoly in the black pepper trade of the country.<ref name=\"kerala.gov.in\"/>\n\n==Outside forces in Malabar==\n{{See also|Zamorin\u2013Palakkad war of 1756\u20131757}}\n\nCanara forces invaded northern Malabar in 1732 at the invitation of the [[Arakkal]]. Under the command of Gopalaji, 30000 strong Canara soldiers, easily overran prince Kunhi Ambu's (Cunhi Homo) forts in northern Kolathunad. By early 1734 the Canara soldiers captured Kudali and Dharmapatnam. By 1736, the Canara army was driven out of the whole of northern Malabar with assistance from the English East India Company. However, the Prince Regent incurred a huge debt with the Company factors at [[Tellichery]] as a result.<ref name=\"ReferenceB\">Lectures on Enthurdogy by A. Krishna Ayer Calcutta, 1925</ref>\n\nThe Nayaks of the Kingdom of Bednur (Keladi, Ikkeri Nayak Kingdom) planned another attack on Kolathunad in 1737. Prince Kunhi Ambu agreed to sign a peace treaty with the Canara which fixed the northern border of Kolathunad on the Madayi. The English factors of Tellicherry also signed their own treaty with the Nayak of Bedanur which guaranteed the integrity of English trading concessions in Malabar in the event of future conflicts between the Canara and Kolathunad.<ref name=\"ReferenceB\"/>\n\n[[Hyder Ali]] first marched to present-day [[Kerala]] in 1757 as per request of King of Palghat who was a long-time military foe of the [[Zamorin]] of nearby [[Kozhikode|Kingdom of Calicut]]. Hyder Ali, who at that time was the [[Faujdar]] of [[Dindigul]] under [[Kingdom of Mysore]], with a force of 2,500 horses and 7,500 men supported by Palghat troops, marched into southern Malabar. The army defeated the [[Kozhikode|Calicut]] army and reached as far as [[Arabian Sea]]. The main intention of this movement to Malabar was to capture the vast treasuries of the rulers of Malabar. Malabar Coast was famous for its foreign spice trade from ancient times. Zamorin came to a treaty with Haider Ali, in which he was demanded to pay twelve hundred thousand rupees as the [[war reparations]]. However, the Zamorin technically deceived Hyder Ali after the return of the Mysore Army from [[Malabar Coast|Malabar]].<ref>Logan, William (2006). Malabar Manual, Mathrubhumi Books, [[Kozhikode]]. {{ISBN|978-81-8264-046-7}}</ref> But, for his role in these activities Hyder Ali was rewarded by Devaraja with the [[jaghir]] (regional governorship) of [[Bangalore]].\n\nThe Calicut army failed because Hyder's troops were organised, armed and trained in the most modern fashion whereas Calicut army, like rest of armies of kings of [[Malabar Coast|Malabar]], relied on feudal levies. Zamorin eventually agreed to pay {{Indian Rupees}}1,200,000 as [[indemnity]] to Hyder Ali and so Hyder Ali withdrew. King of Calicut, despite the invasion, did not modernise his army&nbsp;\u2013 a neglect for which he paid nine years later.\n\n[[File:Anglo-Mysore War 1 and 2.png|thumb|Map showing Malabar and Cochin under Mysore]]\n\n==Occupation of Malabar==\nWhen news of Hyder Ali's conquest of Kingdom of Bednur reached Ali Rajah of Cannanore in 1763, he promptly requested Hyder to invade present-day Kerala and help him deal with Zamorin of [[Kozhikode|Calicut]]. This Muslim chieftain in Cannanore, an old of rival of the neighbouring powerful Kolathiri, was an active ally of Mysore during the years of occupation.<ref>Bowring, pp. 44\u201346</ref><ref>Logan, William (2006), ''Malabar Manual'', Mathrubhumi Books, [[Kozhikode]]. {{ISBN|978-81-8264-046-7}}</ref> Hyder Ali agreed and in 1766 he marched into Malabar through [[Mangalore]] with a force of 12,000 infantry, 4,000 cavalry and a park of field guns. During this time he was desperate for a port which opens to the Arabian sea, as his French allies were supposed to transfer weapons, ammunition and horses against the British. Mahe, a French controlled port, lay in the middle of Malabar. With his modern army, Hyder Ali easily defeated all the petty kingdoms on the Malabar, beginning with [[Kolathunad]].\n\nAli Raja of Cannanore, a long rival of [[Kolathiri]], seized and set fire to the palace of Kolathiri Raja. The latter escaped with his followers to the then-British settlement at [[Tellicherry]]. After the victory, Hyder Ali entered the Kingdom of Kottayam in present-day [[North Malabar]] and occupied it, with assistance from native Muslims, after some resistance by the Kottayam army.<ref>Kerala District Gazetteers: & suppl. Kozhikode By Kerala (India). Dept. of Education, A. Sreedhara Menon p.149</ref> The first serious resistance encountered by Hyder Ali's army was in Kadathanad, followed by a series of atrocities against the natives.\n\n[[File:Thalassery fort.JPG|left|thumb|upright|Thalassery fort, Thalassery]]\n\nAfter taking Calicut in a bloody battle, Hyder Ali, with a large amount of money, marched south-east and moved towards [[Coimbatore]] through [[Palghat]]. Mysore appointed Ali Raja as military governor and Madanna (a former revenue officer) as civil governor of the newly acquired province of Malabar.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">Panikkassery, Velayudhan. MM Publications (2007), Kottayam India</ref>\n\n==Mysore rule (1766\u20131773)==\nShortly after Raza Ali, who was Hyder Ali's lieutenant in command, returned to [[Coimbatore]], Hindu fighters hidden in the forests<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/> rebelled against the Mysore authorities. They,  re-occupied forts and large portions of land in the [[monsoon]] season. However, by June 1766, Hyder Ali himself returned to Malabar and imposed his troops on the rebels, killing many nair soldiers and deporting over 15,000 [[Nair]]s to [[Kanara]]. The Gazetteers state that only 200 of 15,000 Nairs being deported to Kanara survived. One of the most critical battles occurred at [[Pudiyangadi|Putiyangadi]] in the [[Kingdom of Tanur]] (Vettathunad) where the Hindus suffered a complete defeat. The Mysore army stormed the village and re-captured it. Chaotically hundreds of Hindu  local soldiers escaped to the forest hideouts again.\n\n[[File:Sultanbathery.JPG|thumb|Sultan Bathery derives its present name from Tipu Sultan of Mysore who used the Jain temple here and used it as his battery hence the name Sultan's Battery]]\n\nMysore's response to was harsh, and after putting down the rebellion, many Hindu fighters were executed,and thousands of others were forcibly relocated to the Mysore highlands. To prevent another armed uprising, Hyder Ali suggested anti-Nair laws to the district and levied additional taxes as punishment against rebellious Nair chiefs.\n\nEralppad, second line successor to the throne at [[Kozhikode|Calicut]], continued his attacks against the Mysore forces from southern Malabar. Eventually, forced by continuous instability and rebellions, Hyder Ali agreed cede many parts of Malabar to local Hindu rulers (as age old customs existed in Malabar) as tributary states under the Kingdom of Mysore.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://voiceofdharma.com/books/tipu/ |title=Tipu Sultan&nbsp;\u2013 Villain Or Hero? |publisher=Voiceofdharma.com |date= |accessdate=15 November 2011}}</ref> [[Kolathunad]] and [[Palakkad]], the strategic entries to Malabar, remained under the central rule from Mysore. Years later, Kolathunad was given to Kolathiri through some negotiations.\n\n[[File:\u0d1f\u0d3f\u0d2a\u0d4d\u0d2a\u0d41\u0d35\u0d3f\u0d7b\u0d31\u0d46 \u0d15\u0d4b\u0d1f\u0d4d\u0d1f.JPG|thumb|Palakkad Fort]]\n\nAt the start of 1767, the Mysore army unsuccessfully stormed the Kingdom of Travancore from the north.\n\nIn 1767, the whole of Malabar again revolted Mysore's army of 4,000 men, who were defeated by 2,000 Kottayam Nairs in Northern Malabar. All baggage, arms and ammunition of army was looted by the Nair rebels. Mysorean garrisons were trapped by Nair rebels who seized the countryside and ambushed Mysore convoys and communications with great success.<ref name=\"Malabar Manual by Logan\">''Malabar Manual'' by Logan</ref>\n\nThe following year, the English East India Company, under Captain Thomas Henry, sieged the [[Sultan Bathery]] Fort (Avara fort) to interrupt the supply of arms to [[Arakkal Kingdom]], with a promised help from local kingdoms. But the British were forced to retreat in the retaliation.\n\nMysore army retreated from Malabar temporarily in 1768, successfully crushing the uprisings and building the strategic [[Palakkad Fort]].<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/> The authority over [[Kolathunad]] was now given to the [[Arakkal Kingdom]]. Skirmishes between Arakkal and the Company continued, and in 1770, the Company reclaimed Randattara.\n\nIn 1773, [[Mysore]] forces under Said Saheb marched to Malabar through the [[Thamarassery]] Pass, since the Hindu rulers had broke the earlier treaties on paying tributes.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/> So, again in the Malabar came under the direct Mysore authority.\n\n==Cochin accepts Mysore's suzerainty==\nMysore conducted a second military movement in 1774, concentrating on the extremely ancient and unsurpassed treasures of the Main Temple in the city of [[Thiruvananthapuram]], in Travancore. Also, Travancore has given refuge to the political enemies of Mysore from Malabar. Slowly Hyder Ali moved southwards with a huge army and negotiated with the Dutch. He wanted free passage to Travancore through Dutch territories, which was refused (the Dutch owed Travancore after their defeat in the [[Battle of Colachel]]). As Travancore refused to stop the construction of [[Nedumkotta]] fortification, which formed the northern defences of Travancore, rumours of a proposed invasion of Travancore started developing.\n\n[[File:Nedumkotta.jpg|left|thumb|The relics of the entrance of [[Nedumkotta|travancore lines]]]]\n\nHyder Ali asked the rulers of [[Cochin]] and of Travancore to pay tribute as vassal states. Cochin was asked to pay a total of Rs. 40\n0,000 and ten elephants, while Travancore was asked to pay Rs. 1,500,000 and thirty elephants. The Cochin royals agreed to pay the amount and accepted the Mysore's superiority. Finally, Malabar and Cochin came under the Mysore rule, opening Malabar Coast to the kings of Mysore.  However the King of Travancore, who was under the protection of the [[East India Company]], refused to pay the tribute.\n\nEventually the Mysore army began to move to Travancore from the north. The Dutch military garrison at [[Cranganore Fort]] tried to stall the movement. Hyder Ali asked his commander Sardar Khan to take an army of 10,000 along the Cochin Kingdom. In August 1776, Cochin was invaded from the north and the fort at [[Thrissur|Trichur]] was captured.\n\nAfter the surrender of the ruler of Cochin, Hyder advanced to the Travancore Defence Lines (the [[Nedumkotta]] fortifications). By this time Airoor and Chetuva Fort were ceded to Mysore. Meanwhile, the Dutch, with the help of the Travancore Nair Army, put down an attempt by the Mysore forces to capture the Cranganore Fort. The ruler of Cranganore, however surrendered to Hyder Ali, though the Dutch stormed his palace and captured it in January 1778.\n[[File:Fortrelic2.jpg|thumb|Relics of Cranganore Fort]]\n\nAfter this incident, Hyder's forces engaged in small scale attacks and ambushes throughout Malabar, with the Travancore, English and Dutch forces as well as with rooting Nair mutineers in northern Malabar. By 1778, the Mysore allied themselves with the French, who was at war with the [[British Empire]]. In the same year, the English captured [[Mah\u00e9, India|Mah\u00e9]] and [[Pondicherry (city)|Pondicherry]]. The newly appointed king of Kolathunad was with the Mysore, providing crucial supplies to the war and by March, Kolathiri had occupied Randattara. Soon, Hyder Ali removed the kings of [[Kadathanad]] and Kottayam who were providing the English in their campaigns. However, after facing losses in Calicut, Palghat and Tinnevelly, Hyder retreated to Mysore before planning another attack on Travancore.<ref>Travancore State Manual by T.K Velu Pillai, Pages 373 to 385</ref><ref>The Travancore state manual by Aiya, V. Nagam. pp.381\u2013384</ref>\n\n==Malabar in Second Anglo-Mysore War==\n{{main|Second Anglo-Mysore War}}\n\nThe English East India Company captured the French controlled port at [[Mah\u00e9, India|Mah\u00e9]] in Malabar in 1779. Mah\u00e9 was of great strategic importance to Hyder Ali, who received French supplied arms and munition through the port, and Hyder had not only explicitly told the British it was under his protection, he had also provided troops for its defence.On 2 July 1780, Hyder Ali declared war against the English East India Company, signalling the start of what was later called the [[Second Anglo-Mysore War]] (1779\u20131784).<ref name=\"Malabar Manual, Logan, William\">''Malabar Manual'', Logan, William</ref> By February 1782, Dharpattom, Nitore, [[Kozhikode|Calicut]], and Palakkad Fort surrendered to the British forces under Major Abington. Sardar Ali Khan, the Mysore commander, died later.<ref name=\"Malabar Manual, Logan, William\"/>\n\nDuring the summer of 1782, East India Company officials in [[Bombay]] sent additional troops to [[Tellicherry]], from whence they continued operations against Mysorean holdings in the Malabar. Hyder Ali sent his elder [[Tipu Sultan]] and a strong force to counter this threat, and the latter had successfully pinned this force at [[Ponnani]].<ref name=\"Malabar Manual, Logan, William\"/>\n{{Campaignbox Second Anglo-Mysore War}}\nTired of continuous setbacks, Hyder Ali then sent an army unit under Makhdoom Ali to Malabar to restrain the anti-Mysore activities through south. Meanwhile, Major Abington and Colonel Humberstone, who were in Calicut, were ordered to prevent the advance of Makhdoom Ali's army from the south. In the following battle in Tiroorangadi, more than 400 Mysore soldiers, including Makhdoom Ali, were killed. Colonel Humberstone chased the Mysore army to [[Ponnani]], with the principal aim of capturing the Palakkad Fort. Due to a thundering torrential storm in [[Ponnani River]], however, Colonel Humberstone retreated to Calicut. Colonel Humberstone then moved his unit up to Trithala and the neighbourhoods of Mankeri Fort, but again retreated to Ponnani to the fear of a surprise attack from the Mysore-Ali Raja coalition forces intended to siege forces in the extreme weather conditions. Major Macleod subsequently reached Ponnani before taking over the command of British forces on the Malabar Coast.<ref name=\"Malabar Manual, Logan, William\"/> Shortly, Tipu's forces stormed the English camped at Ponnani, but 200 of his men were killed so he temporarily retreated. Simultaneously, a naval force under Edward Hughes reached Ponnani, but the Mysore army threatened the struggling English with a dreadful attack at any time. So, [[Tipu Sultan]] was successful pinning the English forces force at [[Ponnani]].\n\nIt was here Tipu learned of Hyder Ali's sudden death due to cancer. Tipu Sultan's precipitate departure from the scene provided some relief to the British force, but Bombay officials had sent further reinforcements under General Matthews to Ponnani.<ref name=\"Malabar Manual, Logan, William\"/>\n\nThe British captured [[Mangalore]] in March 1783, but Tipu, now the ruler of Mysore, recaptured Bednorem before besieging and eventually capturing Mangalore. At the same time, in the Tanjore region, Stuart's army joined with those of Colonel Fullarton before the latter marched along the Dindigul-Dharapuram-Palakkad route and sieged the [[Palakkad Fort]]. Captain Midland and Sir Thomas under Colonel Fullarton successfully captured Palakkad Fort on 14 November 1783. During this time, the Company officials, having received orders from London to bring an end to the war, entered negotiations with Tipu Sultan. Pursuant to a preliminary ceasefire, Colonel Fullarton was ordered to abandon all of his recent conquests. However, due to allegations that Tipu violated terms of the ceasefire at Mangalore, Fullarton remained at Palakkad Fort. During this time, a prince from the Zamorin dynasty emerged and the English retreated conferring the Fort to the prince. But, soon Tipu's forces marched to Palakkad fort and occupied it with the entire southern Malabar.<ref name=\"Malabar Manual, Logan, William\"/>\n\nIn December 1783, General Macleod, with fresh support of the French, captured Cannanore from the [[Arakkal]], who was an ally of Mysore in Malabar. This was followed by Beebi's failed negotiation attempt with the British.<ref name=\"Malabar Manual, Logan, William\"/>\n\nThe war was ended on 11 March 1784 with the signing of the [[Treaty of Mangalore]], in which both sides agreed to restore the others' lands to the ''status quo ante bellum''. By this treaty, the British (and the Nair kings) controlled the entire northern Malabar, and Mysore ruled southern Malabar. And General Macleod was forced to move back forces from Cannanore.<ref name=\"Malabar Manual, Logan, William\"/>\n\n==Mysore rule between the wars (1784\u20131789)==\nAfter the Second Anglo-Mysore War, the Mysore ruled Malabar which experienced numerous anti-Mysore uprisings  by the local Hindu population against the new land taxes. Tipu Sultan, to put an end to the land problems appointed the officer Arshad Beg Khan as the Civil Governor of Malabar. Khan soon retired from service and advised to Tipu to visit the region by his own. In 1788, Tipu paid an official visit to Malabar and talked with the Resident Gribble about the construction of new city near Beypore.<ref name=\"Malabar Manual, Logan, William\"/>\n\nIn 1787, the Mysore captured Iruvazhinadu by murdering Kurungothu Nair, the ruler of Iruvazhinadu and an old ally of the French.<ref name=\"Malabar Manual, Logan, William\"/> The French then became the closest ally of Mysore, continuing to supply arms to the kingdom. In the meantime, Arakkal Beebi allied with the English and Kolathiri replaced them as the ally of Mysore. Kolathiri captured Randattara and Darmadom from the English. Later in 1789, however, the company recaptured Darmadom.\n\nIn 1788, [[Ravi Varma of Padinjare Kovilakam|Ravi Varma]], a rebel hailing from the Zamorin dynasty, proclaimed his rule of the region and marched to [[Kozhikode|Calicut]] with his Nair army.The Nair army was defeated under the superior Mysore lines led by M. Lally and Mir Asar Ali Khan.<ref name=\"Malabar Manual, Logan, William\"/> However, during the above operations, Ravi Varma assisted not less than 30,000 Brahmins to flee the country and take refuge in Travancore.<ref>History of Tipu Sultan By Mohibbul Hasan p.141-143</ref> In 1789, Tipu marched to Kozhikode with a 60,000-strong army, destroyed the fort, and razed the town to the ground. This event is known as the Fall of Calicut.\n\nIn August 1788, the ruler of Parappanad, a chieftain of Nilamboor, Trichera Thiruppad, and many other Hindu nobles who had been carried away earlier to Coimbatore by Mysore under Tipu, were [[Forced conversion#Islam|forcibly converted to Islam]].<ref>Tipu Sultan: As known in Kerala, by Ravi Varma. p.507</ref>\n\nAlmost all female members and many male members of different Royal families such as Chirakkal (Kolathiri) and Calicut (Zamorin), and chieftains' families like Punnathoor, Nilamboor, Kavalapara and Azhvanchery Thamprakkal, fled to Travancore with all the Temple-wealth in their dominions, and found political asylum there from Mysore under Tipu, and temporarily settled down in different parts of Travancore. Even after the fall of Tipu Sultan in Srirangapatanam, many of these families preferred to remain in Travancore. The Chirackal (Kolathiri) were in fact a branch of Travancore Royal Family itself, originated in Thiruvananthapuram and based in Kannur, with a centuries-old tradition of mutual adoption of heirs with the latter.\n\n==Tipu Sultan's attacks on Travancore (1789\u20131790)==\n{{See also|Battle of the Nedumkotta (1789)|Third Anglo-Mysore War}}\nTipu Sultan decided to tighten his grip on the possessions in Malabar and to occupy Travancore as he saw the control of ports and access of routes to them highly strategic. The control over Travancore was always been a dream of the Mysore sultans, and Hyder Ali's attempt to defeat Travancore was failed in 1767. The kingdom of [[Travancore]] had been a target of Tipu Sultan since the end of the [[Second Anglo-Mysore War]]. Indirect attempts to take over the kingdom had failed in 1788, and [[Archibald Campbell (British Army officer)|Archibald Campbell]], the Madras president at the time, had warned Tipu that an attack on Travancore would be treated as a declaration of war on the Company.<ref name=F549>Fortescue, p. 549</ref> Tipu Sultan received invitation to intervene from the ruler of Cannanore, and soon the Mysore forces were in Malabar.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/> Initially Tipu Sultan tried to induce Travancore tactically with the help of the Kingdom of Cochin, but the King of Cochin refused and allied with Travancore.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/>\n\nMonitoring closely the conquest of Mysore on Malabar and the making of Cochin to a tributary state, Travancore had bought Cranganore and Pallippuram forts from the Dutch. Travancore deteriorated relations by extending the Nedunkotta fortifications along the border with Mysore into territory claimed by Mysore in Cochin. Travancore, via the [[Nawab of Carnatic]], found relations with the English East India Company and expected a retaliation by them on an attack on the Nedunkotta fortifications.\n\nIn 1789, Tipu sent forces to the Malabar to put down a rebellion; many found political asylum in Travancore and Cochin in the wake of his advance.<ref>Fortescue, p. 548</ref>\n\nIn late 1789, Tipu began to build up troops at [[Coimbatore]] in preparation for an assault on the [[Nedumkotta]], the fortified line of defence built by [[Dharma Raja of Travancore]] To follow the 1789 rebels.<ref name=\"Malabar Manual, Logan, William\"/>\n\nOn 28,29 December 1789, Tipu Sultan attacked the Nedunkotta from the north, signalling the start of the [[Battle of the Nedumkotta]] (Travancore-Mysore War).Out of his army numbering several tens of thousands, about 14,000 along with committed local Muslim militia marched towards the fortifications.\n\n{{Campaignbox Third Anglo-Mysore War}}\n\nBy 29 December, a large portion of the right flank of Nedumkotta was under the control of Mysore army. Only a {{Convert|16|ft|m}}wide and {{Convert|20|ft|m}} deep ditch separated the Kingdom of Travancore from Mysore forces. Tipu Sultan commanded his soldiers to level up the ditch, so that his army can advance, while retreating Travancore soldiers and militiamen regrouped on the other side of the ditch. Unable to fill the ditch under heavy fire from the enemy, Tipu ordered his soldiers to march forward through a very narrow passage. This move backfired on the Mysore, as a group of two dozen Nair militiamen from the Nandyat kalari under Vaikom Padmanabha Pillai ambushed their enemies half-way. A few dozen Mysore soldiers died of direct gun-fire, and the commanding officer was killed. Many more panicked and in the ensuing chaos fell into the ditch and died. The reinforcements sent by the Mysore were prevented from merging with the main contingent by a batch of the Travancore regular army. The Mysore army suffered severe casualties. Several high-ranking Mysorean officers were taken prisoner, including five Europeans.\n \nThe onset of monsoons (there is also a legend that a small group of Travancorean amrmy led by Vaikom Padmanabha Pillai and Kunjai Kutty Pillai went upstream and destroyed the dam at Bhoothathankettu causing heavy flash floods in the Periyar river) prevented Tipu from moving south (combat being much more difficult during the [[monsoon]] season) and in the meantime, the British declared war on Tipu in favour of their ally, Travancore. Tipu retreated to defend his capital in the midst of the campaign owing to inhospitable weather and tight defense of travancore army<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/>\n\n==British take the Malabar==\nIn late 1790, British forces took control of the Malabar Coast. A force under Colonel Hartley gained a decisive victory (in the Battle of [[Kozhikode|Calicut]]) in December, while a second under [[Robert Abercromby of Airthrey|Robert Abercromby]] routed the Mysore at Cannanore a few days later.<ref>Fortescue, p. 561</ref>\nMysore forces were defeated by the Travancore forces near the Alwaye River in 1790.{{citation needed|date=March 2020}}\n\n===Battle of Calicut (1790)===\n{{main|Battle of Calicut (1790)}}\n[[File:Anglo-Mysore War 3.png|thumb|Map of south India, showing Malabar under East India Company]]\nThe Battle of [[Kozhikode|Calicut]] (also called the \"Battle of Thiroorangadi\") took place between 7 and 12 December 1790, at [[Thiroorangadi]]. Three regiments from the British East India Company, consisting of 1,500 men, led by Lieutenant Colonel James Hartley, decisively defeated a 9,000-man Mysore army, killing or wounding about 1,000, and taking a large number of prisoners, including the commander, Hussein Ali.\n\n===Capture of Cannanore===\n{{main|Capture of Cannanore}}\nForces of the British East India Company, led by General Robert Abercromby, began besieging Cannanore, held by troops of Mysore and of the Ali Raja on 14 December. After gaining control of the high ground commanding the city's main fort, the defenders surrendered. The British victory, along with the taking of [[Kozhikode|Calicut]] by a separate force a few days earlier, secured their control over the Malabar Coast.\n\n==End of Mysore rule==\n{{main|Treaty of Seringapatam}}\nBy the Treaty of Seringapatam signed in 1792, Malabar ceded to the English East India Company. The treaty resulted in a sharp curtailment of Mysore's borders to the advantage of the Mahrattas, the Nizam of Hyderabad, and the [[Madras Presidency]]. The districts of [[Malabar District|Malabar]], [[Salem District|Salem]], [[Bellary District|Bellary]] and [[Anantapur District|Anantapur]] were ceded to the Madras presidency.<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=QIyz79F3Nn0C&pg=PA392&dq=Seringapatam&lr=&as_brr=3&client=firefox-a&sig=l_6_DAL_wD-FFzcOXZ8YQ8o4KBs David Eggenberger, ''An Encyclopedia of Battles'', 1985]</ref>\n\n==Changes in Malabar==\nSultans of Mysore changed the ancient landlord system in Malabar just like the changes which took place in [[Kingdom of Cochin]] and [[Travancore]]. To control the region, Tipu Sultan adopted strong measures against Nair nobles of Malabar and established a centralised administrative system. This led to the marginalisation of nair and affluent and rise of a subsequent  Muslim  elite. The changes in Malabar due to the Mysore invasions were as follows:\n\n* Due to the fleeing of the local Nair chieftains and landlords to Travancore lead to a redistribution of landed wealth. However, for revenues, Tipu introduced the \"Jamabandi\" system to collect taxes directly from peasants.\n* Land was surveyed extensively and classified. Taxes were fixed considering difference of land and crops and for some crops taxes were reduced.\n* Tipu introduced monopoly in products like pepper, coconut, tobacco, sandalwood, teak etc. \n* The roads developed by Tipu for military purposes were helpful for the development of trade.\n\n===Ethnic cleansing===\nAs per a commission of enquiry appointed by the English soon after Tipu Sultan's death, during the rule of Tipu Sultan tens of thousands of Nairs (Hindus), besides about 30,000 Brahmins and Christians, fled Malabar to seek refuge in Travancore.\n\nAccording to M. Gangadharan, there is evidence that many Hindus were forcefully converted into Islam. In one of the most widely documented cases, the army invaded Kadathanadu and forcibly converted the Nair soldiers, who was holding out for many weeks against the well equipped mysore army without adequate weapons or food.<ref>Gazetteer of the Bombay Presidency, Volume 1, Part 2 By Bombay (India : State) p.660</ref>\n\nLocal Hindus and Christians suffered from the Mysore invasion. Almost a fourth of the Nair population was wiped out and many more were forcibly converted. The Nambuthiris (Brahmins) were also severely affected. According to various rough sources, about half the Hindu population of Malabar fled the country to the forests or Tellicherry and Travancore. They included most of the Hindu Rajas and chieftains who could not resist the invading Mysore army. The Chirackal, Parappanad, Ballussery, Kurumbranad, Kadathanad, Palghat and [[Kozhikode|Calicut]] royal families migrated to Travancore. The chieftain families which did the same were those of Punnathur, [[Kavalappara]] and Azhvancherry Thamprakkal. Even the Cochin royal family moved to Vaikkom Palace near the famous Shiva Temple when Tipu Sultan's army reached Alwaye.\n\nMany members of the royal families of Malabar who migrated to Travancore preferred to remain there despite the withdrawal of Tipu's army and restoration of peace due to the harsh experience and the peculiar \"psyche\" of Muslim population in Malabar. The prominent royal families were; (1) Neerazhi Kovilakam, (2) Gramathil Kottaram, (3) Paliyakkara, (4) Nedumparampu, (5) Chempra Madham, (6) Ananthapuram Kottaram, (7) Ezhimatoor Palace, (8) Aranmula Kottaram, (9) Varanathu Kovilakam, (10) Mavelikkara, (11) Ennakkadu, (12) Murikkoyikkal Palace, (13) Mariappilly, (14) Koratti Swaroopam, (15) Kaippuzha Kovilakam, (16) Lakshmipuram Palace, and (17) Kottapuram.\n\nKarthika Thirunal Rama Varma, the King of Travancore earned the title was addressed as ''Dharma Raja'' on account of his strict adherence to Dharma Sastra, the principles of justice by providing asylum to the thousands of Hindus fleeing Malabar. He is also credited with successful  defense against Tipu's assault on present-day southern [[Kerala]].\n\nTipu Sultan \"Islamized\" the place names across Malabar; Mangalapuram (Mangalore) was changed to Jalalabad, Beypore (Vaippura) to Sultanpatanam or Faruqui, and Calicut to Islamabad. It was only after the death of Tipu Sultan that the local people reverted to old names; however, only one of the names is intact, [[Feroke]]. In Cherunad, Vettathunad, Eranad, Valluvanad, Thamarassery and other interior areas, local Mappilas unleashed a reign of terror on the Hindu population, mainly to retain the occupied land of Hindu landlords and to establish their domination over Hindus. Fearing the organised robberies and violence, people could not even travel freely in the Malabar hinterland of predominantly Mappila population.<ref>Kerala under Haidar Ali and Tipu Sultan By C. K. Kareem p.198</ref>\n\nA broad picture of atrocities in Kadathanad by Mysore army under Hyder Ali as described by a Muslim officer of Mysore army in his diary and as edited by [[Ghulam Muhammad Sultan Sahib]], only surviving son of Tipu Sultan, is given as;<ref>Tipu Sultan: As known in Kerala, by Ravi Varma. p.508</ref>\n\n{{cquote|Nothing was to be seen on the roads for a distance of four leagues, nothing was found but only scattered limbs and mutilated bodies of Hindus.

Therefore, Hyder Ali Khan by another ordinance, consented to restore all social and political privileges including carrying of arms, to the Nairs who embraced the Mohammadan religion. Many nobles had to embrace Islam; but a significantly large section (Nairs, Chieftains and Brahmins) chose rather to take refuge in the Kingdom of Travancore in the South than to submit to the last ordinance.}}\n\nGunddart said in his ''Kerala Pazhama'' that it is just not possible to describe the cruel atrocities perpetrated by Tipu Sultan in Kozhikode during the Fall in 1789.

Tipu Sultan entered the fort and offered to spare their lives, provided they accepted conversion to Islam. After several days of resistance, and finding it difficult to defend the fort any longer, the Nairs submitted to the usual terms of surrender&nbsp;\u2013 a voluntary profession of the Islam or a forced conversion with deportation from the land. The unhappy Nair captives gave a forced consent and on the next day, they were converted and at closing the ceremony every individual of both men and women was forced to eat beef, which was prohibited to them by faith.\n\nAll the members of one branch of Parappanad Royal Family were forcibly converted to Islam except for one or two who escaped from Tipu's army. Similarly, one Thiruppad belonging to Nilamboor Royal Family was also forcibly abducted and converted to Islam. Thereafter, it was reported that further conversions of Hindus were attempted through those converts.<ref>Rise and fulfilment of English rule in India By Edward John Thompson, Geoffrey Theodore Garratt p.209</ref>\n\nWhen the Kolathiri Raja eventually surrendered and paid tribute, Tipu killed him, dragged his dead body tied to the feet of an elephant through the streets, and finally hanged him from a tree-top to show his contempt for Hindu Rajas. Palghat Raja, Ettipangi Achan, who had surrendered, was imprisoned on suspicion and later taken to Sreerangapatanam. Nothing was heard of him subsequently.\n\nWhile escaping from Tipu's army, one of the princes of the Chirackal Royal family in North Malabar was captured and killed in an encounter after a chase of few days. As per the accounts of Tipu's own diary and as confirmed by the English Company records, the body of the unfortunate prince was treated with great indignities by Tipu Sultan. \"He had the dead body of the prince dragged by elephants through his camp and it was subsequently hung up on a tree along with seventeen of his followers who had been captured alive\". Another chieftain, Korangoth Nair, who had resisted Tipu, was finally captured with the help of the French and hanged.<ref>Tipu Sultan: villain or hero? : an anthology By Sita Ram Goel p.31</ref>\n\n====Destruction of Hindu temples====\nAccording to the ''Malabar Manual'' by William Logan, Thrichambaram and Thalipparampu temples in Chirackal Taluk, Thiruvangatu Temple (Brass Pagoda) in Tellicherry, and Ponmeri Temple near Badakara were all destroyed by the Mysore forces under Tipu Sultan.

But Tipu Sultan forced the Hindu temples to pay heavy taxes. The famous Hemambika Temple at Kalpathi of the Palghat Raja who had surrendered to Hyder Ali, the Kachamkurissi Temple of the Kollamkottu Raja who had deserted the Zamorin and sided with Hyder Ali, and also the Jain Temple at Palghat suffered serious damages during the rule of Tipu Sultan. Other famous temples were looted and \"desecrated\".\n\n====Concealment of the Hindu idol at Guruvayur====\nIn 1766, Hyder Ali of Mysore captured [[Kozhikode|Calicut]] and then [[Guruvayur]]. To refrain from the demolition of [[Guruvayur Temple|the Hindu temple at Guruvayur]], Mysore demanded 10,000 fanams from the authorities, which was paid. At the request of Governor of Malabar, Shrinivasa Rao, Hyder Ali granted a ''devadaya'' (free gift) and the temple at Guruvayur was saved from destruction.\n\nTippu Sultan again invaded the [[Zamorin of Calicut]]'s province in 1789. Aware of the risk to the idol, it was hidden underground and the Utsava vigraha was taken to [[Ambalappuzha Sri Krishna Temple]] by Mallisseri Namboodiri and Kakkad Othikkan. Tippu destroyed the smaller shrines and set fire to the temple, but it was saved due to timely rain. Tippu lost to the Zamorin, [[Travancore]] and the English in 1792. Although the hidden idol and the Utsava vigraha were re-installed on 17 September 1792, the daily poojas and routines were seriously disrupted.<ref>http://voiceofdharma.org/books/tipu/ch04.htm</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://guruvayurprarthana.com/aboutguruvayur.aspx |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2015-05-04 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141113034742/http://guruvayurprarthana.com/aboutguruvayur.aspx |archivedate=13 November 2014 |df=dmy-all }}</ref>\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|War|India}}\n* [[Local Resistance to Mysore Rule in Malabar]]\n* [[Anglo-Mysore Wars]]\n* [[Pazhassi Raja]]\n* [[Siege of Tellicherry]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n{{Kingdom of Travancore}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Mysore Invasion Of Kerala}}\n[[Category:History of Kerala]]\n[[Category:Mysore invasion of Kerala| ]]\n", "text_old": "{{POV|date=December 2015}}\n{{Use dmy dates|date=March 2014}}\n{{EngvarB|date=March 2014}}\n{{Infobox military conflict\n| conflict    = Mysorean invasion of Malabar\n| partof      = Expansions of [[Kingdom of Mysore]] <br> [[Anglo-Mysore Wars]]\n| image       = Palakkad Fort.JPG\n| image_size  = 300\n| caption     = View of Tipu Sultan's Fort, [[Palakkad]] from outside the northern wall\n| date        = 1766\u20131792\n| place       = [[South India]]\n| result      = [[Kingdom of Mysore|Mysore]] rule in Malabar\n| territory   = Transfer of territories from local kings to Mysore and then to English East India Company\n| combatant1  = {{flagicon image|Flag of Mysore.svg}}[[Kingdom of Mysore|Mysore]]<br> {{flagicon image|Arakkal_flag_1.png}}[[Ali Raja]] of [[Cannanore]] <br> Local [[Muslim]] community{{citation needed|date=January 2014}}\n| combatant2  = {{flagicon image|Flag of the British East India Company (1707).svg}} [[British East India Company]]<br>\n[[Zamorin of Calicut]]<br>Nair rebels\n{{flagicon|Travancore}} Raja of [[Travancore]]\n| commander1  = \n| commander2  = \n}}\n\nThe '''Mysorean invasion of Kerala''' (1766 \u20131792) was the [[Offensive (military)|military invasion]] of northern [[Malabar region|Malabar]] (now [[Kerala]]), including the territories of the [[Zamorin]] of [[Kozhikode|Calicut]], by the [[Muslim]] ''de facto'' ruler of the [[Kingdom of Mysore]] [[Hyder Ali]]. After completing the occupation, [[Kingdom of Cochin]], situated south of Malabar, was made a tributary state of Mysore. The major reason for the occupation of Malabar was the desire to have access to  Indian Ocean ports. The Mysore invasion provided the [[English East India Company]] more chances to tighten their grip on the ancient feudal principalities of Malabar and converting [[Travancore]], over whom Mysore Sultans attacked after Cochin, to a mere protected ally<ref name=\"kerala.gov.in\">{{cite web |url=http://www.kerala.gov.in/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=2852&Itemid=2291 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-06-08 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121009144939/http://kerala.gov.in/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=2852&Itemid=2291 |archivedate=9 October 2012 |df=dmy-all }} www.kerala.gov.in History</ref>\n\nBy the 18th century, all the petty kingdoms of present-day [[Kerala]] had been absorbed or subordinated by three big states of [[Travancore]], [[Zamorin|Calicut (ruled by Zamorins)]] and [[Kingdom of Cochin|Cochin]]. [[Kingdom of Mysore]], nominally ruled by the [[Wodeyar]] family, rose to prominence in India after the decline of the [[Vijayanagara Empire]] and again after [[Mughal empire]]. In 1761, [[Hyder Ali]] seized control of all of the reins of power in Mysore by overthrowing a powerful minister and became the \"de facto\" head of Mysore Kingdom. He turned his attention towards expansion which included the capture of the Kingdoms of Bednur (Ikkeri or Keladi<ref>[http://princelystatesofindia.com/Extinguished/bednur.html Kingdom of Bednur]</ref>), Sunda, Sera, and Canara. In 1766, he descended into Malabar and occupied the Kingdoms of Chirakkal (former [[Kolathunad]]), Kottayam, [[Kadathanad]], Calicut, [[Valluvanad (southern Malabar)|Valluvanad]] and Palghat and King of [[Kingdom of Cochin|Cochin]] accepted his suzerainty and paid him tribute annually for from 1766{{Citation needed|date=January 2012}} till 1790.

By 1801, the [[Madras Presidency]] was created by [[Richard Wellesley, 1st Marquess Wellesley|Lord Wellesley]], by attaching Malabar along with Carnatic territories seized from Mysore. Travancore was asked by the Company to meet the entire expenditure of the Third Anglo-Mysore war on the plea that the war was undertaken in defence of Travancore. The new treaty of 1795 reduced Travancore from a friend and ally of the English East India Company to that of a protected ally. The King was forced to entertain a subsidiary force far beyond his capacity to subsidise. The Company also claimed a monopoly in the black pepper trade of the country.<ref name=\"kerala.gov.in\"/>\n\n==Outside forces in Malabar==\n{{See also|Zamorin\u2013Palakkad war of 1756\u20131757}}\n\nCanara forces invaded northern Malabar in 1732 at the invitation of the [[Arakkal]]. Under the command of Gopalaji, 30000 strong Canara soldiers, easily overran prince Kunhi Ambu's (Cunhi Homo) forts in northern Kolathunad. By early 1734 the Canara soldiers captured Kudali and Dharmapatnam. By 1736, the Canara army was driven out of the whole of northern Malabar with assistance from the English East India Company. However, the Prince Regent incurred a huge debt with the Company factors at [[Tellichery]] as a result.<ref name=\"ReferenceB\">Lectures on Enthurdogy by A. Krishna Ayer Calcutta, 1925</ref>\n\nThe Nayaks of the Kingdom of Bednur (Keladi, Ikkeri Nayak Kingdom) planned another attack on Kolathunad in 1737. Prince Kunhi Ambu agreed to sign a peace treaty with the Canara which fixed the northern border of Kolathunad on the Madayi. The English factors of Tellicherry also signed their own treaty with the Nayak of Bedanur which guaranteed the integrity of English trading concessions in Malabar in the event of future conflicts between the Canara and Kolathunad.<ref name=\"ReferenceB\"/>\n\n[[Hyder Ali]] first marched to present-day [[Kerala]] in 1757 as per request of King of Palghat who was a long-time military foe of the [[Zamorin]] of nearby [[Kozhikode|Kingdom of Calicut]]. Hyder Ali, who at that time was the [[Faujdar]] of [[Dindigul]] under [[Kingdom of Mysore]], with a force of 2,500 horses and 7,500 men supported by Palghat troops, marched into southern Malabar. The army defeated the [[Kozhikode|Calicut]] army and reached as far as [[Arabian Sea]]. The main intention of this movement to Malabar was to capture the vast treasuries of the rulers of Malabar. Malabar Coast was famous for its foreign spice trade from ancient times. Zamorin came to a treaty with Haider Ali, in which he was demanded to pay twelve hundred thousand rupees as the [[war reparations]]. However, the Zamorin technically deceived Hyder Ali after the return of the Mysore Army from [[Malabar Coast|Malabar]].<ref>Logan, William (2006). Malabar Manual, Mathrubhumi Books, [[Kozhikode]]. {{ISBN|978-81-8264-046-7}}</ref> But, for his role in these activities Hyder Ali was rewarded by Devaraja with the [[jaghir]] (regional governorship) of [[Bangalore]].\n\nThe Calicut army failed because Hyder's troops were organised, armed and trained in the most modern fashion whereas Calicut army, like rest of armies of kings of [[Malabar Coast|Malabar]], relied on feudal levies. Zamorin eventually agreed to pay {{Indian Rupees}}1,200,000 as [[indemnity]] to Hyder Ali and so Hyder Ali withdrew. King of Calicut, despite the invasion, did not modernise his army&nbsp;\u2013 a neglect for which he paid nine years later.\n\n[[File:Anglo-Mysore War 1 and 2.png|thumb|Map showing Malabar and Cochin under Mysore]]\n\n==Occupation of Malabar==\nWhen news of Hyder Ali's conquest of Kingdom of Bednur reached Ali Rajah of Cannanore in 1763, he promptly requested Hyder to invade present-day Kerala and help him deal with Zamorin of [[Kozhikode|Calicut]]. This Muslim chieftain in Cannanore, an old of rival of the neighbouring powerful Kolathiri, was an active ally of Mysore during the years of occupation.<ref>Bowring, pp. 44\u201346</ref><ref>Logan, William (2006), ''Malabar Manual'', Mathrubhumi Books, [[Kozhikode]]. {{ISBN|978-81-8264-046-7}}</ref> Hyder Ali agreed and in 1766 he marched into Malabar through [[Mangalore]] with a force of 12,000 infantry, 4,000 cavalry and a park of field guns. During this time he was desperate for a port which opens to the Arabian sea, as his French allies were supposed to transfer weapons, ammunition and horses against the British. Mahe, a French controlled port, lay in the middle of Malabar. With his modern army, Hyder Ali easily defeated all the petty kingdoms on the Malabar, beginning with [[Kolathunad]].\n\nAli Raja of Cannanore, a long rival of [[Kolathiri]], seized and set fire to the palace of Kolathiri Raja. The latter escaped with his followers to the then-British settlement at [[Tellicherry]]. After the victory, Hyder Ali entered the Kingdom of Kottayam in present-day [[North Malabar]] and occupied it, with assistance from native Muslims, after some resistance by the Kottayam army.<ref>Kerala District Gazetteers: & suppl. Kozhikode By Kerala (India). Dept. of Education, A.

Mysore appointed Ali Raja as military governor and Madanna (a former revenue officer) as civil governor of the newly acquired province of Malabar.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">Panikkassery, Velayudhan. MM Publications (2007), Kottayam India</ref>\n\n==Mysore rule (1766\u20131773)==\nShortly after Raza Ali, who was Hyder Ali's lieutenant in command, returned to [[Coimbatore]], Hindu fighters hidden in the forests<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/> rebelled against the Mysore authorities. They,  re-occupied forts and large portions of land in the [[monsoon]] season. However, by June 1766, Hyder Ali himself returned to Malabar and imposed his troops on the rebels, killing many nair soldiers and deporting over 15,000 [[Nair]]s to [[Kanara]]. The Gazetteers state that only 200 of 15,000 Nairs being deported to Kanara survived. One of the most critical battles occurred at [[Pudiyangadi|Putiyangadi]] in the [[Kingdom of Tanur]] (Vettathunad) where the Hindus suffered a complete defeat. The Mysore army stormed the village and re-captured it. Chaotically hundreds of Hindu  local soldiers escaped to the forest hideouts again.\n\n[[File:Sultanbathery.JPG|thumb|Sultan Bathery derives its present name from Tipu Sultan of Mysore who used the Jain temple here and used it as his battery hence the name Sultan's Battery]]\n\nMysore's response to was harsh, and after putting down the rebellion, many Hindu fighters were executed,and thousands of others were forcibly relocated to the Mysore highlands. To prevent another armed uprising, Hyder Ali suggested anti-Nair laws to the district and levied additional taxes as punishment against rebellious Nair chiefs.\n\nEralppad, second line successor to the throne at [[Kozhikode|Calicut]], continued his attacks against the Mysore forces from southern Malabar. Eventually, forced by continuous instability and rebellions, Hyder Ali agreed cede many parts of Malabar to local Hindu rulers (as age old customs existed in Malabar) as tributary states under the Kingdom of Mysore.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://voiceofdharma.com/books/tipu/ |title=Tipu Sultan&nbsp;\u2013 Villain Or Hero? |publisher=Voiceofdharma.com |date= |accessdate=15 November 2011}}</ref> [[Kolathunad]] and [[Palakkad]], the strategic entries to Malabar, remained under the central rule from Mysore. Years later, Kolathunad was given to Kolathiri through some negotiations.\n\n[[File:\u0d1f\u0d3f\u0d2a\u0d4d\u0d2a\u0d41\u0d35\u0d3f\u0d7b\u0d31\u0d46 \u0d15\u0d4b\u0d1f\u0d4d\u0d1f.JPG|thumb|Palakkad Fort]]\n\nAt the start of 1767, the Mysore army unsuccessfully stormed the Kingdom of Travancore from the north.\n\nIn 1767, the whole of Malabar again revolted Mysore's army of 4,000 men, who were defeated by 2,000 Kottayam Nairs in Northern Malabar. All baggage, arms and ammunition of army was looted by the Nair rebels. Mysorean garrisons were trapped by Nair rebels who seized the countryside and ambushed Mysore convoys and communications with great success.<ref name=\"Malabar Manual by Logan\">''Malabar Manual'' by Logan</ref>\n\nThe following year, the English East India Company, under Captain Thomas Henry, sieged the [[Sultan Bathery]] Fort (Avara fort) to interrupt the supply of arms to [[Arakkal Kingdom]], with a promised help from local kingdoms. But the British were forced to retreat in the retaliation.\n\nMysore army retreated from Malabar temporarily in 1768, successfully crushing the uprisings and building the strategic [[Palakkad Fort]].<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/> The authority over [[Kolathunad]] was now given to the [[Arakkal Kingdom]]. Skirmishes between Arakkal and the Company continued, and in 1770, the Company reclaimed Randattara.\n\nIn 1773, [[Mysore]] forces under Said Saheb marched to Malabar through the [[Thamarassery]] Pass, since the Hindu rulers had broke the earlier treaties on paying tributes.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/> So, again in the Malabar came under the direct Mysore authority.\n\n==Cochin accepts Mysore's suzerainty==\nMysore conducted a second military movement in 1774, concentrating on the extremely ancient and unsurpassed treasures of the Main Temple in the city of [[Thiruvananthapuram]], in Travancore. Also, Travancore has given refuge to the political enemies of Mysore from Malabar. Slowly Hyder Ali moved southwards with a huge army and negotiated with the Dutch. He wanted free passage to Travancore through Dutch territories, which was refused (the Dutch owed Travancore after their defeat in the [[Battle of Colachel]]). As Travancore refused to stop the construction of [[Nedumkotta]] fortification, which formed the northern defences of Travancore, rumours of a proposed invasion of Travancore started developing.\n\n[[File:Nedumkotta.jpg|left|thumb|The relics of the entrance of [[Nedumkotta|travancore lines]]]]\n\nHyder Ali asked the rulers of [[Cochin]] and of Travancore to pay tribute as vassal states. Cochin was asked to pay a total of Rs. 40\n0,000 and ten elephants, while Travancore was asked to pay Rs. 1,500,000 and thirty elephants. The Cochin royals agreed to pay the amount and accepted the Mysore's superiority. Finally, Malabar and Cochin came under the Mysore rule, opening Malabar Coast to the kings of Mysore.  However the King of Travancore, who was under the protection of the [[East India Company]], refused to pay the tribute.\n\nEventually the Mysore army began to move to Travancore from the north. The Dutch military garrison at [[Cranganore Fort]] tried to stall the movement. Hyder Ali asked his commander Sardar Khan to take an army of 10,000 along the Cochin Kingdom. In August 1776, Cochin was invaded from the north and the fort at [[Thrissur|Trichur]] was captured.\n\nAfter the surrender of the ruler of Cochin, Hyder advanced to the Travancore Defence Lines (the [[Nedumkotta]] fortifications). By this time Airoor and Chetuva Fort were ceded to Mysore. Meanwhile, the Dutch, with the help of the Travancore Nair Army, put down an attempt by the Mysore forces to capture the Cranganore Fort. The ruler of Cranganore, however surrendered to Hyder Ali, though the Dutch stormed his palace and captured it in January 1778.\n[[File:Fortrelic2.jpg|thumb|Relics of Cranganore Fort]]\n\nAfter this incident, Hyder's forces engaged in small scale attacks and ambushes throughout Malabar, with the Travancore, English and Dutch forces as well as with rooting Nair mutineers in northern Malabar. By 1778, the Mysore allied themselves with the French, who was at war with the [[British Empire]]. In the same year, the English captured [[Mah\u00e9, India|Mah\u00e9]] and [[Pondicherry (city)|Pondicherry]]. The newly appointed king of Kolathunad was with the Mysore, providing crucial supplies to the war and by March, Kolathiri had occupied Randattara. Soon, Hyder Ali removed the kings of [[Kadathanad]] and Kottayam who were providing the English in their campaigns. However, after facing losses in Calicut, Palghat and Tinnevelly, Hyder retreated to Mysore before planning another attack on Travancore.<ref>Travancore State Manual by T.K Velu Pillai, Pages 373 to 385</ref><ref>The Travancore state manual by Aiya, V. Nagam. pp.381\u2013384</ref>\n\n==Malabar in Second Anglo-Mysore War==\n{{main|Second Anglo-Mysore War}}\n\nThe English East India Company captured the French controlled port at [[Mah\u00e9, India|Mah\u00e9]] in Malabar in 1779. Mah\u00e9 was of great strategic importance to Hyder Ali, who received French supplied arms and munition through the port, and Hyder had not only explicitly told the British it was under his protection, he had also provided troops for its defence.On 2 July 1780, Hyder Ali declared war against the English East India Company, signalling the start of what was later called the [[Second Anglo-Mysore War]] (1779\u20131784).<ref name=\"Malabar Manual, Logan, William\">''Malabar Manual'', Logan, William</ref> By February 1782, Dharpattom, Nitore, [[Kozhikode|Calicut]], and Palakkad Fort surrendered to the British forces under Major Abington. Sardar Ali Khan, the Mysore commander, died later.<ref name=\"Malabar Manual, Logan, William\"/>\n\nDuring the summer of 1782, East India Company officials in [[Bombay]] sent additional troops to [[Tellicherry]], from whence they continued operations against Mysorean holdings in the Malabar. Hyder Ali sent his elder [[Tipu Sultan]] and a strong force to counter this threat, and the latter had successfully pinned this force at [[Ponnani]].<ref name=\"Malabar Manual, Logan, William\"/>\n{{Campaignbox Second Anglo-Mysore War}}\nTired of continuous setbacks, Hyder Ali then sent an army unit under Makhdoom Ali to Malabar to restrain the anti-Mysore activities through south. Meanwhile, Major Abington and Colonel Humberstone, who were in Calicut, were ordered to prevent the advance of Makhdoom Ali's army from the south. In the following battle in Tiroorangadi, more than 400 Mysore soldiers, including Makhdoom Ali, were killed. Colonel Humberstone chased the Mysore army to [[Ponnani]], with the principal aim of capturing the Palakkad Fort. Due to a thundering torrential storm in [[Ponnani River]], however, Colonel Humberstone retreated to Calicut. Colonel Humberstone then moved his unit up to Trithala and the neighbourhoods of Mankeri Fort, but again retreated to Ponnani to the fear of a surprise attack from the Mysore-Ali Raja coalition forces intended to siege forces in the extreme weather conditions. Major Macleod subsequently reached Ponnani before taking over the command of British forces on the Malabar Coast.<ref name=\"Malabar Manual, Logan, William\"/> Shortly, Tipu's forces stormed the English camped at Ponnani, but 200 of his men were killed so he temporarily retreated. Simultaneously, a naval force under Edward Hughes reached Ponnani, but the Mysore army threatened the struggling English with a dreadful attack at any time. So, [[Tipu Sultan]] was successful pinning the English forces force at [[Ponnani]].\n\nIt was here Tipu learned of Hyder Ali's sudden death due to cancer. Tipu Sultan's precipitate departure from the scene provided some relief to the British force, but Bombay officials had sent further reinforcements under General Matthews to Ponnani.<ref name=\"Malabar Manual, Logan, William\"/>\n\nThe British captured [[Mangalore]] in March 1783, but Tipu, now the ruler of Mysore, recaptured Bednorem before besieging and eventually capturing Mangalore. At the same time, in the Tanjore region, Stuart's army joined with those of Colonel Fullarton before the latter marched along the Dindigul-Dharapuram-Palakkad route and sieged the [[Palakkad Fort]]. Captain Midland and Sir Thomas under Colonel Fullarton successfully captured Palakkad Fort on 14 November 1783. During this time, the Company officials, having received orders from London to bring an end to the war, entered negotiations with Tipu Sultan. Pursuant to a preliminary ceasefire, Colonel Fullarton was ordered to abandon all of his recent conquests. However, due to allegations that Tipu violated terms of the ceasefire at Mangalore, Fullarton remained at Palakkad Fort. During this time, a prince from the Zamorin dynasty emerged and the English retreated conferring the Fort to the prince. But, soon Tipu's forces marched to Palakkad fort and occupied it with the entire southern Malabar.<ref name=\"Malabar Manual, Logan, William\"/>\n\nIn December 1783, General Macleod, with fresh support of the French, captured Cannanore from the [[Arakkal]], who was an ally of Mysore in Malabar. This was followed by Beebi's failed negotiation attempt with the British.<ref name=\"Malabar Manual, Logan, William\"/>\n\nThe war was ended on 11 March 1784 with the signing of the [[Treaty of Mangalore]], in which both sides agreed to restore the others' lands to the ''status quo ante bellum''. By this treaty, the British (and the Nair kings) controlled the entire northern Malabar, and Mysore ruled southern Malabar. And General Macleod was forced to move back forces from Cannanore.<ref name=\"Malabar Manual, Logan, William\"/>\n\n==Mysore rule between the wars (1784\u20131789)==\nAfter the Second Anglo-Mysore War, the Mysore ruled Malabar which experienced numerous anti-Mysore uprisings  by the local Hindu population against the new land taxes. Tipu Sultan, to put an end to the land problems appointed the officer Arshad Beg Khan as the Civil Governor of Malabar. Khan soon retired from service and advised to Tipu to visit the region by his own. In 1788, Tipu paid an official visit to Malabar and talked with the Resident Gribble about the construction of new city near Beypore.<ref name=\"Malabar Manual, Logan, William\"/>\n\nIn 1787, the Mysore captured Iruvazhinadu by murdering Kurungothu Nair, the ruler of Iruvazhinadu and an old ally of the French.<ref name=\"Malabar Manual, Logan, William\"/> The French then became the closest ally of Mysore, continuing to supply arms to the kingdom. In the meantime, Arakkal Beebi allied with the English and Kolathiri replaced them as the ally of Mysore. Kolathiri captured Randattara and Darmadom from the English. Later in 1789, however, the company recaptured Darmadom.\n\nIn 1788, [[Ravi Varma of Padinjare Kovilakam|Ravi Varma]], a rebel hailing from the Zamorin dynasty, proclaimed his rule of the region and marched to [[Kozhikode|Calicut]] with his Nair army.The Nair army was defeated under the superior Mysore lines led by M. Lally and Mir Asar Ali Khan.<ref name=\"Malabar Manual, Logan, William\"/> However, during the above operations, Ravi Varma assisted not less than 30,000 Brahmins to flee the country and take refuge in Travancore.<ref>History of Tipu Sultan By Mohibbul Hasan p.141-143</ref> In 1789, Tipu marched to Kozhikode with a 60,000-strong army, destroyed the fort, and razed the town to the ground. This event is known as the Fall of Calicut.\n\nIn August 1788, the ruler of Parappanad, a chieftain of Nilamboor, Trichera Thiruppad, and many other Hindu nobles who had been carried away earlier to Coimbatore by Mysore under Tipu, were [[Forced conversion#Islam|forcibly converted to Islam]].<ref>Tipu Sultan: As known in Kerala, by Ravi Varma. p.507</ref>\n\nAlmost all female members and many male members of different Royal families such as Chirakkal (Kolathiri) and Calicut (Zamorin), and chieftains' families like Punnathoor, Nilamboor, Kavalapara and Azhvanchery Thamprakkal, fled to Travancore with all the Temple-wealth in their dominions, and found political asylum there from Mysore under Tipu, and temporarily settled down in different parts of Travancore. Even after the fall of Tipu Sultan in Srirangapatanam, many of these families preferred to remain in Travancore. The Chirackal (Kolathiri) were in fact a branch of Travancore Royal Family itself, originated in Thiruvananthapuram and based in Kannur, with a centuries-old tradition of mutual adoption of heirs with the latter.\n\n==Tipu Sultan's attacks on Travancore (1789\u20131790)==\n{{See also|Battle of the Nedumkotta (1789)|Third Anglo-Mysore War}}\nTipu Sultan decided to tighten his grip on the possessions in Malabar and to occupy Travancore as he saw the control of ports and access of routes to them highly strategic. The control over Travancore was always been a dream of the Mysore sultans, and Hyder Ali's attempt to defeat Travancore was failed in 1767. The kingdom of [[Travancore]] had been a target of Tipu Sultan since the end of the [[Second Anglo-Mysore War]]. Indirect attempts to take over the kingdom had failed in 1788, and [[Archibald Campbell (British Army officer)|Archibald Campbell]], the Madras president at the time, had warned Tipu that an attack on Travancore would be treated as a declaration of war on the Company.<ref name=F549>Fortescue, p. 549</ref> Tipu Sultan received invitation to intervene from the ruler of Cannanore, and soon the Mysore forces were in Malabar.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/> Initially Tipu Sultan tried to induce Travancore tactically with the help of the Kingdom of Cochin, but the King of Cochin refused and allied with Travancore.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/>\n\nMonitoring closely the conquest of Mysore on Malabar and the making of Cochin to a tributary state, Travancore had bought Cranganore and Pallippuram forts from the Dutch. Travancore deteriorated relations by extending the Nedunkotta fortifications along the border with Mysore into territory claimed by Mysore in Cochin. Travancore, via the [[Nawab of Carnatic]], found relations with the English East India Company and expected a retaliation by them on an attack on the Nedunkotta fortifications.\n\nIn 1789, Tipu sent forces to the Malabar to put down a rebellion; many found political asylum in Travancore and Cochin in the wake of his advance.<ref>Fortescue, p. 548</ref>\n\nIn late 1789, Tipu began to build up troops at [[Coimbatore]] in preparation for an assault on the [[Nedumkotta]], the fortified line of defence built by [[Dharma Raja of Travancore]] To follow the 1789 rebels.<ref name=\"Malabar Manual, Logan, William\"/>\n\nOn 28,29 December 1789, Tipu Sultan attacked the Nedunkotta from the north, signalling the start of the [[Battle of the Nedumkotta]] (Travancore-Mysore War).Out of his army numbering several tens of thousands, about 14,000 along with committed local Muslim militia marched towards the fortifications.\n\n{{Campaignbox Third Anglo-Mysore War}}\n\nBy 29 December, a large portion of the right flank of Nedumkotta was under the control of Mysore army. Only a {{Convert|16|ft|m}}wide and {{Convert|20|ft|m}} deep ditch separated the Kingdom of Travancore from Mysore forces. Tipu Sultan commanded his soldiers to level up the ditch, so that his army can advance, while retreating Travancore soldiers and militiamen regrouped on the other side of the ditch. Unable to fill the ditch under heavy fire from the enemy, Tipu ordered his soldiers to march forward through a very narrow passage. This move backfired on the Mysore, as a group of two dozen Nair militiamen from the Nandyat kalari under Vaikom Padmanabha Pillai ambushed their enemies half-way. A few dozen Mysore soldiers died of direct gun-fire, and the commanding officer was killed. Many more panicked and in the ensuing chaos fell into the ditch and died. The reinforcements sent by the Mysore were prevented from merging with the main contingent by a batch of the Travancore regular army. The Mysore army suffered severe casualties. Several high-ranking Mysorean officers were taken prisoner, including five Europeans.\n \nThe onset of monsoons (there is also a legend that a small group of Travancorean amrmy led by Vaikom Padmanabha Pillai and Kunjai Kutty Pillai went upstream and destroyed the dam at Bhoothathankettu causing heavy flash floods in the Periyar river) prevented Tipu from moving south (combat being much more difficult during the [[monsoon]] season) and in the meantime, the British declared war on Tipu in favour of their ally, Travancore. Tipu retreated to defend his capital in the midst of the campaign owing to inhospitable weather and tight defense of travancore army<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/>\n\n==British take the Malabar==\nIn late 1790, British forces took control of the Malabar Coast. A force under Colonel Hartley gained a decisive victory (in the Battle of [[Kozhikode|Calicut]]) in December, while a second under [[Robert Abercromby of Airthrey|Robert Abercromby]] routed the Mysore at Cannanore a few days later.<ref>Fortescue, p. 561</ref>\nMysore forces were defeated by the Travancore forces near the Alwaye River in 1790.{{citation needed|date=March 2020}}\n\n===Battle of Calicut (1790)===\n{{main|Battle of Calicut (1790)}}\n[[File:Anglo-Mysore War 3.png|thumb|Map of south India, showing Malabar under East India Company]]\nThe Battle of [[Kozhikode|Calicut]] (also called the \"Battle of Thiroorangadi\") took place between 7 and 12 December 1790, at [[Thiroorangadi]]. Three regiments from the British East India Company, consisting of 1,500 men, led by Lieutenant Colonel James Hartley, decisively defeated a 9,000-man Mysore army, killing or wounding about 1,000, and taking a large number of prisoners, including the commander, Hussein Ali.\n\n===Capture of Cannanore===\n{{main|Capture of Cannanore}}\nForces of the British East India Company, led by General Robert Abercromby, began besieging Cannanore, held by troops of Mysore and of the Ali Raja on 14 December. After gaining control of the high ground commanding the city's main fort, the defenders surrendered. The British victory, along with the taking of [[Kozhikode|Calicut]] by a separate force a few days earlier, secured their control over the Malabar Coast.\n\n==End of Mysore rule==\n{{main|Treaty of Seringapatam}}\nBy the Treaty of Seringapatam signed in 1792, Malabar ceded to the English East India Company. The treaty resulted in a sharp curtailment of Mysore's borders to the advantage of the Mahrattas, the Nizam of Hyderabad, and the [[Madras Presidency]]. The districts of [[Malabar District|Malabar]], [[Salem District|Salem]], [[Bellary District|Bellary]] and [[Anantapur District|Anantapur]] were ceded to the Madras presidency.<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=QIyz79F3Nn0C&pg=PA392&dq=Seringapatam&lr=&as_brr=3&client=firefox-a&sig=l_6_DAL_wD-FFzcOXZ8YQ8o4KBs David Eggenberger, ''An Encyclopedia of Battles'', 1985]</ref>\n\n==Changes in Malabar==\nSultans of Mysore changed the ancient landlord system in Malabar just like the changes which took place in [[Kingdom of Cochin]] and [[Travancore]]. To control the region, Tipu Sultan adopted strong measures against Nair nobles of Malabar and established a centralised administrative system. This led to the marginalisation of nair and affluent and rise of a subsequent  Muslim  elite. The changes in Malabar due to the Mysore invasions were as follows:\n\n* Due to the fleeing of the local Nair chieftains and landlords to Travancore lead to a redistribution of landed wealth. However, for revenues, Tipu introduced the \"Jamabandi\" system to collect taxes directly from peasants.\n* Land was surveyed extensively and classified. Taxes were fixed considering difference of land and crops and for some crops taxes were reduced.\n* Tipu introduced monopoly in products like pepper, coconut, tobacco, sandalwood, teak etc. \n* The roads developed by Tipu for military purposes were helpful for the development of trade.\n\n===Ethnic cleansing===\nAs per a commission of enquiry appointed by the English soon after Tipu Sultan's death, during the rule of Tipu Sultan tens of thousands of Nairs (Hindus), besides about 30,000 Brahmins and Christians, fled Malabar to seek refuge in Travancore.\n\nAccording to M. Gangadharan, there is evidence that many Hindus were forcefully converted into Islam. In one of the most widely documented cases, the army invaded Kadathanadu and forcibly converted the Nair soldiers, who was holding out for many weeks against the well equipped mysore army without adequate weapons or food.<ref>Gazetteer of the Bombay Presidency, Volume 1, Part 2 By Bombay (India : State) p.660</ref>\n\nLocal Hindus and Christians suffered from the Mysore invasion. Almost a fourth of the Nair population was wiped out and many more were forcibly converted. The Nambuthiris (Brahmins) were also severely affected. According to various rough sources, about half the Hindu population of Malabar fled the country to the forests or Tellicherry and Travancore. They included most of the Hindu Rajas and chieftains who could not resist the invading Mysore army. The Chirackal, Parappanad, Ballussery, Kurumbranad, Kadathanad, Palghat and [[Kozhikode|Calicut]] royal families migrated to Travancore. The chieftain families which did the same were those of Punnathur, [[Kavalappara]] and Azhvancherry Thamprakkal. Even the Cochin royal family moved to Vaikkom Palace near the famous Shiva Temple when Tipu Sultan's army reached Alwaye.\n\nMany members of the royal families of Malabar who migrated to Travancore preferred to remain there despite the withdrawal of Tipu's army and restoration of peace due to the harsh experience and the peculiar \"psyche\" of Muslim population in Malabar. The prominent royal families were; (1) Neerazhi Kovilakam, (2) Gramathil Kottaram, (3) Paliyakkara, (4) Nedumparampu, (5) Chempra Madham, (6) Ananthapuram Kottaram, (7) Ezhimatoor Palace, (8) Aranmula Kottaram, (9) Varanathu Kovilakam, (10) Mavelikkara, (11) Ennakkadu, (12) Murikkoyikkal Palace, (13) Mariappilly, (14) Koratti Swaroopam, (15) Kaippuzha Kovilakam, (16) Lakshmipuram Palace, and (17) Kottapuram.\n\nKarthika Thirunal Rama Varma, the King of Travancore earned the title was addressed as ''Dharma Raja'' on account of his strict adherence to Dharma Sastra, the principles of justice by providing asylum to the thousands of Hindus fleeing Malabar. He is also credited with successful  defense against Tipu's assault on present-day southern [[Kerala]].\n\nTipu Sultan \"Islamized\" the place names across Malabar; Mangalapuram (Mangalore) was changed to Jalalabad, Beypore (Vaippura) to Sultanpatanam or Faruqui, and Calicut to Islamabad. It was only after the death of Tipu Sultan that the local people reverted to old names; however, only one of the names is intact, [[Feroke]]. In Cherunad, Vettathunad, Eranad, Valluvanad, Thamarassery and other interior areas, local Mappilas unleashed a reign of terror on the Hindu population, mainly to retain the occupied land of Hindu landlords and to establish their domination over Hindus. Fearing the organised robberies and violence, people could not even travel freely in the Malabar hinterland of predominantly Mappila population.<ref>Kerala under Haidar Ali and Tipu Sultan By C. K. Kareem p.198</ref>\n\nA broad picture of atrocities in Kadathanad by Mysore army under Hyder Ali as described by a Muslim officer of Mysore army in his diary and as edited by [[Ghulam Muhammad Sultan Sahib]], only surviving son of Tipu Sultan, is given as;<ref>Tipu Sultan: As known in Kerala, by Ravi Varma. p.508</ref>\n\n{{cquote|Nothing was to be seen on the roads for a distance of four leagues, nothing was found but only scattered limbs and mutilated bodies of Hindus.

However, as soon as the unfortunate Hindus returned on his promise, Hyder made sure that they were all hanged to death and their wives and children reduced to slavery.\"<ref>Tipu Sultan: As known in Kerala, by Ravi Varma. p.468</ref>\n\nRavi Varma further states that:<ref>Kerala District Gazetteers: & suppl.

This ordinance was found to make the submission of the proud Nairs absolutely impossible because they would have thought death preferable to such humiliations and degradation. Therefore, Hyder Ali Khan by another ordinance, consented to restore all social and political privileges including carrying of arms, to the Nairs who embraced the Mohammadan religion. Many nobles had to embrace Islam; but a significantly large section (Nairs, Chieftains and Brahmins) chose rather to take refuge in the Kingdom of Travancore in the South than to submit to the last ordinance.}}\n\nGunddart said in his ''Kerala Pazhama'' that it is just not possible to describe the cruel atrocities perpetrated by Tipu Sultan in Kozhikode during the Fall in 1789. William Logan gives in his ''Malabar Manual'' a long list of temples destroyed by Tipu Sultan and his army.<ref name=\"Malabar Manual by Logan\"/> Elankulam Kunjan Pillai has recorded the situation in Malabar as follows:<ref>Mathrubhoomi Weekly of 25 December 1955</ref><ref>Kerala District Gazetteers: Cannanore By A.

There were around 7000 Namboodiri houses,of which more than 2000 houses were destroyed by Tipu Sultan's army in Kozhikode alone. Sultan did not spare even children and women. Menfolk escaped to forests and neighbouring principalities. Muslim population  increased many fold (due to forced conversions and for enhanced social status). During the military regime of Tipu Sultan, Hindus were forcibly circumcised and converted to Muhammadan faith. As a result of Tipu's atrocities, strength of Nairs and Cheramars significantly diminished in number. Namboodiris also substantially decreased in number.}}\n\nAtrocities committed in Malabar during the days of Tipu Sultan's military regime have been described in great detail in the works of many reputed authors. Notable among them, ''Travancore State Manual'' of T.K. Velu Pillai and ''Kerala Sahitya Charitam'' of Ulloor Parameshwara Iyer.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://voiceofdharma.com/books/tipu/ch01.htm |title=The Sword of Tipu Sultan |publisher=Voiceofdharma.com |date=25 February 1990 |accessdate=15 November 2011}}</ref>\n\nIn a letter dated 18 January 1790, to Syed Abdul Dulai, Tipu writes:<ref>K.M.

That barbarian Tipu Sultan tied the naked Christians and Hindus to the legs of elephants and made the elephants to move around till the bodies of the helpless victims were torn to pieces. Temples and churches were ordered to be burned down, desecrated and destroyed. Christian and Hindu women were forced to marry Mohammadans.Those Christians and hindus who refused to be honoured with Islam, were ordered to be killed by hanging immediately.

However, many others, especially the Thiyyas, fled to Tellicherry and [[Mah\u00e9, India|Mah\u00e9]].\n\n====Extermination of Nairs====\n{{main|Captivity of Nairs at Seringapatam}}\n\nIn 1788, Tipu Sultan gave strict orders to his army under M.

After entrusting [[Kozhikode|Calicut]] to a powerful army contingent, he instructed it \"''to surround the woods and seize the heads of all Nair factions''\".\n\nA small army of 2,000 Nairs of Kadathanadu resisted the invasion of the huge army of Tipu Sultan from a fortress in Kuttipuram for a few weeks soon the rebels were reduced to starvation and death. Tipu Sultan entered the fort and offered to spare their lives, provided they accepted conversion to Islam. After several days of resistance, and finding it difficult to defend the fort any longer, the Nairs submitted to the usual terms of surrender&nbsp;\u2013 a voluntary profession of the Islam or a forced conversion with deportation from the land. The unhappy Nair captives gave a forced consent and on the next day, they were converted and at closing the ceremony every individual of both men and women was forced to eat beef, which was prohibited to them by faith.\n\nAll the members of one branch of Parappanad Royal Family were forcibly converted to Islam except for one or two who escaped from Tipu's army. Similarly, one Thiruppad belonging to Nilamboor Royal Family was also forcibly abducted and converted to Islam. Thereafter, it was reported that further conversions of Hindus were attempted through those converts.<ref>Rise and fulfilment of English rule in India By Edward John Thompson, Geoffrey Theodore Garratt p.209</ref>\n\nWhen the Kolathiri Raja eventually surrendered and paid tribute, Tipu killed him, dragged his dead body tied to the feet of an elephant through the streets, and finally hanged him from a tree-top to show his contempt for Hindu Rajas. Palghat Raja, Ettipangi Achan, who had surrendered, was imprisoned on suspicion and later taken to Sreerangapatanam. Nothing was heard of him subsequently.\n\nWhile escaping from Tipu's army, one of the princes of the Chirackal Royal family in North Malabar was captured and killed in an encounter after a chase of few days. As per the accounts of Tipu's own diary and as confirmed by the English Company records, the body of the unfortunate prince was treated with great indignities by Tipu Sultan. \"He had the dead body of the prince dragged by elephants through his camp and it was subsequently hung up on a tree along with seventeen of his followers who had been captured alive\". Another chieftain, Korangoth Nair, who had resisted Tipu, was finally captured with the help of the French and hanged.<ref>Tipu Sultan: villain or hero? : an anthology By Sita Ram Goel p.31</ref>\n\n====Destruction of Hindu temples====\nAccording to the ''Malabar Manual'' by William Logan, Thrichambaram and Thalipparampu temples in Chirackal Taluk, Thiruvangatu Temple (Brass Pagoda) in Tellicherry, and Ponmeri Temple near Badakara were all destroyed by the Mysore forces under Tipu Sultan. The ''Malabar Manual'' mention that the Maniyoor mosque was once a Hindu temple. The local belief is that it was converted to a mosque during the days of Mysore rule under Tipu Sultan.<ref>''Malabar Manual'' by William Logan</ref>{{Citation needed|reason=Malabar Manual have two volumes, mention which volume and position of reference(Page number or heading)|date=September 2019}}\n\nVatakkankoor Raja Raja Varma in his famous literary work, ''History of Sanskrit Literature in Kerala'', has written the following about the loss and destruction faced by the Hindu temples in present-day [[Kerala]] during the regime of Tipu Sultan:\n\n{{cquote|There was no limit as to the loss the Hindu temples suffered due to the military operations of Tipu Sultan.

The devastation caused by this new Ravana's barbarous activities have not yet been fully rectified.}}\n\nHyder Ali had exempted Hindu temples from the payment of land tax. But Tipu Sultan forced the Hindu temples to pay heavy taxes. The famous Hemambika Temple at Kalpathi of the Palghat Raja who had surrendered to Hyder Ali, the Kachamkurissi Temple of the Kollamkottu Raja who had deserted the Zamorin and sided with Hyder Ali, and also the Jain Temple at Palghat suffered serious damages during the rule of Tipu Sultan. Other famous temples were looted and \"desecrated\".\n\n====Concealment of the Hindu idol at Guruvayur====\nIn 1766, Hyder Ali of Mysore captured [[Kozhikode|Calicut]] and then [[Guruvayur]]. To refrain from the demolition of [[Guruvayur Temple|the Hindu temple at Guruvayur]], Mysore demanded 10,000 fanams from the authorities, which was paid. At the request of Governor of Malabar, Shrinivasa Rao, Hyder Ali granted a ''devadaya'' (free gift) and the temple at Guruvayur was saved from destruction.\n\nTippu Sultan again invaded the [[Zamorin of Calicut]]'s province in 1789. Aware of the risk to the idol, it was hidden underground and the Utsava vigraha was taken to [[Ambalappuzha Sri Krishna Temple]] by Mallisseri Namboodiri and Kakkad Othikkan. Tippu destroyed the smaller shrines and set fire to the temple, but it was saved due to timely rain. Tippu lost to the Zamorin, [[Travancore]] and the English in 1792. Although the hidden idol and the Utsava vigraha were re-installed on 17 September 1792, the daily poojas and routines were seriously disrupted.<ref>http://voiceofdharma.org/books/tipu/ch04.htm</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://guruvayurprarthana.com/aboutguruvayur.aspx |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2015-05-04 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141113034742/http://guruvayurprarthana.com/aboutguruvayur.aspx |archivedate=13 November 2014 |df=dmy-all }}</ref>\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|War|India}}\n* [[Local Resistance to Mysore Rule in Malabar]]\n* [[Anglo-Mysore Wars]]\n* [[Pazhassi Raja]]\n* [[Siege of Tellicherry]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n{{Kingdom of Travancore}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Mysore Invasion Of Kerala}}\n[[Category:History of Kerala]]\n[[Category:Mysore invasion of Kerala| ]]\n", "name_user": "Joshua Issac", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200etop:rv change by vandal.", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mysorean_invasion_of_Malabar"}

His first track to make the Billboard [[Hot Dance Music/Club Play]] chart was \"Witch Doktor,\"<ref name=\"Larkin90\"/> which made the top 5 in 1994, and led to opportunities to remix acts such as [[New Order (band)|New Order]], [[Deep Forest]], [[Jimmy Somerville]], [[Deee-Lite]], and [[Faithless]].\n\nHowever, it was the \"Professional Widow\" remix that established him and became a dance hit around the world as well as a number-one hit in the [[United Kingdom]].<ref name=\"Larkin90\"/> Van Helden stated of his compensation for the remix: \"it was like $10,000, and that was a little below what I was making back then for a remix, but I had the time.\"<ref>{{cite web |url=http://daily.redbullmusicacademy.com/2015/04/armand-van-helden-interview |title=Interview: Armand Van Helden |publisher=The Red Bull Music Academy Daily}}</ref> However, it led to work remixing [[the Rolling Stones]], [[Janet Jackson]], [[Katy Perry]], [[Britney Spears]], and [[Sean Combs|Puff Daddy]], as well as [[Daft Punk]] and [[Sneaker Pimps]], adding to his reputation as one of the world's top house-music musicians.\n\nIn 1996, Van Helden was in a group known as Da Mongoloids, consisting of [[Thomas Bangalter]] of [[Daft Punk]], Van Helden and [[Junior Sanchez]].
