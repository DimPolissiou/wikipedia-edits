The snout is moderately elongated<ref name=Barsbold1980/>, with a [[premaxilla]] featuring elongated nasal [[Process (anatomy)|processes]]. A fine, vertical lamina of [[bone]] is connected rostrally to the medial margin of the premaxilla, indicating that when the animal was alive, a [[cartilaginous]] [[Nasal septum|internasal septum]] was present. Additional to this, the premaxilla features lateral and medial [[foramina]] that are connected by a complex system of [[Blood vessel|vascular canals]], which pervades the structure of the premaxilla and is probably associated with the sensory branches of the neurovasculature and [[ophthalmic nerve]] supporting the [[Beak#Rhamphotheca|rhamphotheca]] (beak). The [[maxilla]] is triangular in shape and preserves 24 [[Dental alveolus|alveoli]], the [[teeth]] are [[homodont]] with coarse [[Denticle (tooth feature)|serrations]]. The [[dentary]] is wedge-shaped elongated and preserves 31 alveoli. In dorsal view, it is U-shaped and dorsoventrally flattened with a transverse expansion. The lateral and ventral surfaces in the symphyseal region bears a series of foramina that measure {{convert|2|to|5|mm|cm|abbr=on}} in diameter, Isolated foramina are connected internally by a complex neurovascular canal.<ref name=Stephan2014>{{cite journal|last1=Stephan|first1=L.|last2=Lawrence|first2=M.

The particular cervicals were not figured and counted, but briefly described. The cervicals are [https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Centrum_Morphology.svg platycoelous] with low [[Vertebra#Structure|neural arches]].<ref name=Barsbold1980/> Being relatively robust, they have thick [[Articular processes|prezygapophyses]] and large parapophyses. Additional, the cervicals show some resemblance to those of ''Segnosaurus'', however, being much smaller.<ref name=PerleA1981/>\n\n====Hindlimb====\n\nThe preserved right [[Pes (anatomy)|pes]] is virtually complete, only missing the proximal end of the [[metatarsals]] II, III and IV. It is shortened in length, with robust metatarsals that bear widened articular extremities, and form a non-compact metatarsus. The metatarsal I is the shortest in comparison, expanding the laterally extended proximal [[articular surface]] of the metatarsus. All of the remaining metatarsals, are somewhat equal in size. Pedal [[Digit (anatomy)|digits]] are very peculiar in structure; the first digit is reduced in length, with all the remaining digits being nearly equal in length, however the fourth digit is very thin compared to the others. The [[phalanges]] of the three first digits are shortened, robust with comparable structure. The second and third phalanx of fourth digit are discoidal and stocky. Lastly, the [[unguals]] are recurved, exceptionally large, and strongly compressed laterally.<ref name=Barsbold1980/> Gregory S. Paul surmised that the long, slender [[claws]] of the feet were used for self-defence mechanism.<ref name=Paul2010/>\n\n====Forelimb====\nThe left [[humerus]] is the only preserved remain from the pectoral region. The humerus shows an elongated [[epiphyses]] and a relatively large [[Deltoid tuberosity|deltoideal]] process.<ref name=Barsbold1980/> As pointed by Perle 1981, it is robust with an estimated maximal length of {{convert|30|cm|mm|abbr=on}}. It has a reduced shaft. The proximal end of the humeurs is greatly broad. The [[humeral head]] features an [[Joint|articular]] surface that is convex and broad, in the middle it is reduced toward the margins. A prominent [[Deltopectoral groove|deltopectoral]] crest is present with the top located 1/3 at the length of the humerus from the proximal end. The articulation [[condyles]] for the [[Radius (bone|radius]] and [[ulna]] are differentiated and divided by a shortened, furrow-like [[Fossa (anatomy)|fossa]] and overall, they are very reduced in size. The fossa for the ulnar process is moderately deep and wide.

Analysis of the brain cavity revealed that ''Erlikosaurus'', and quite likely most other therizinosaurids, had well developed senses of smell, hearing, and balance, traits better associated with [[carnivorous]] [[theropods]]. The enlarged forebrain of ''Erlikosaurus'' may also have been useful in complex [[social behavior]] and [[Ethology#Benefits and costs of group living|predator evasion]].<ref name=Lautenschlager2012/>\n[[File:Erlikosaurus and Segnosaurus lower jaw.png|thumb|left|200px|Lower jaw of ''Erlikosaurus'' (bottom) and ''Segnosaurus'' (top) compared]]\nThe well preserved jaws of ''Erlikosaurus'' also allowed a study by the University of Bristol to determine how its feeding style and dietary preferences were linked to how wide it could open its mouth. In the study, performed by Stephen Lautenshlager et al., It was revealed that ''Erlikosaurus'' could open its mouth to a 43 degree angle at maximum. Also included in the study for comparison were the carnivorous theropods ''[[Allosaurus]]'' and ''[[Tyrannosaurus]]''. From the comparisons, it was indicated that carnivorous dinosaurs had wider jaw gapes than herbivores, much as modern carnivorous animals do today.<ref name=Lautenschlager2015>{{cite journal|first1=L.|last1=Stephan|title=Estimating cranial musculoskeletal constraints in theropod dinosaurs|year=2015|journal=Royal Society Open Science|volume=2|issue=11|doi=10.1098/rsos.150495|pmid=26716007|pmc=4680622|pages=150495|bibcode=2015RSOS....250495L}}</ref>\n\nMore findings about its exceptional skull have been made. Based on comparisons between the highly specialized mandible of ''[[Segnosaurus]]'' and the simple one from ''Erlikosaurus'', these taxa were separated by [[niche partitioning]]. For instance, the mandible of ''Segnosaurus'' features very complex specializations, such as a gracile, recurved dentary, and a thickened lateral shelf. The dentition bears a triple carinae on the lower teeth, lingually folded mesial carinae appressed against triangular denticulate facets on the distal carinae, and extracarinal accessory [[Denticle (tooth feature)|denticles]].

A fine, vertical lamina of [[bone]] is connected rostrally to the medial margin of the premaxilla, indicating that when the animal was alive, a [[cartilaginous]] [[Nasal septum|internasal septum]] was present. Additional to this, the premaxilla features lateral and medial [[foramina]] that are connected by a complex system of [[Blood vessel|vascular canals]], which pervades the structure of the premaxilla and is probably associated with the sensory branches of the neurovasculature and [[ophthalmic nerve]] supporting the [[Beak#Rhamphotheca|rhamphotheca]] (beak). The [[maxilla]] is triangular in shape and preserves 24 [[Dental alveolus|alveoli]], the [[teeth]] are [[homodont]] with coarse [[Denticle (tooth feature)|serrations]]. The [[dentary]] is wedge-shaped elongated and preserves 31 alveoli. In dorsal view, it is U-shaped and dorsoventrally flattened with a transverse expansion. The lateral and ventral surfaces in the symphyseal region bears a series of foramina that measure {{convert|2|to|5|mm|cm|abbr=on}} in diameter, Isolated foramina are connected internally by a complex neurovascular canal.<ref name=Stephan2014>{{cite journal|last1=Stephan|first1=L.|last2=Lawrence|first2=M.

The particular cervicals were not figured and counted, but briefly described. The cervicals are [https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Centrum_Morphology.svg platycoelous] with low [[Vertebra#Structure|neural arches]].<ref name=Barsbold1980/> Being relatively robust, they have thick [[Articular processes|prezygapophyses]] and large parapophyses.

It is shortened in length, with robust metatarsals that bear widened articular extremities, and form a non-compact metatarsus. The metatarsal I is the shortest in comparison, expanding the laterally extended proximal [[articular surface]] of the metatarsus. All of the remaining metatarsals, are somewhat equal in size. Pedal [[Digit (anatomy)|digits]] are very peculiar in structure; the first digit is reduced in length, with all the remaining digits being nearly equal in length, however the fourth digit is very thin compared to the others. The [[phalanges]] of the three first digits are shortened, robust with comparable structure. The second and third phalanx of fourth digit are discoidal and stocky. Lastly, the [[unguals]] are recurved, exceptionally large, and strongly compressed laterally.<ref name=Barsbold1980/> Gregory S. Paul surmised that the long, slender [[claws]] of the feet were used for self-defence mechanism.<ref name=Paul2010/>\n\n====Forelimb====\nThe left [[humerus]] is the only preserved remain from the pectoral region. The humerus shows an elongated [[epiphyses]] and a relatively large [[Deltoid tuberosity|deltoideal]] process.<ref name=Barsbold1980/> As pointed by Perle 1981, it is robust with an estimated maximal length of {{convert|30|cm|mm|abbr=on}}. It has a reduced shaft. The proximal end of the humeurs is greatly broad. The [[humeral head]] features an [[Joint|articular]] surface that is convex and broad, in the middle it is reduced toward the margins. A prominent [[Deltopectoral groove|deltopectoral]] crest is present with the top located 1/3 at the length of the humerus from the proximal end. The articulation [[condyles]] for the [[Radius (bone|radius]] and [[ulna]] are differentiated and divided by a shortened, furrow-like [[Fossa (anatomy)|fossa]] and overall, they are very reduced in size. The fossa for the ulnar process is moderately deep and wide.

In the study, performed by Stephen Lautenshlager et al., It was revealed that ''Erlikosaurus'' could open its mouth to a 43 degree angle at maximum.

For that reason, Grande Prairie is sometimes nicknamed the \"Swan City\". The dinosaur has emerged as an unofficial symbol of the city due to paleontology discoveries in the areas north and west of the Grande Prairie.\n\n== History ==\n\nGrande Prairie was named for the large prairie which lies to the north, east, and west of it. In the 18th century, the prairie was occupied by bands of the [[Dane-zaa]] (Beaver) peoples, who began trading with the [[North West Company]] at [[Dunvegan, Alberta|Dunvegan]] in the early 19th century. The earliest recorded reference to the prairie was by trader [[Samuel Black]] in 1824. In 1880, a [[Hudson's Bay Company]] post called La Grande Prairie was established by George Kennedy {{convert|15|mi|abbr=on}} northwest of the present city. In the late 19th century, the prairie was settled by [[Cree]] and [[Iroquois]] from around [[Jasper, Alberta|Jasper]] and [[Lac Ste. Anne (Alberta)|Lac Ste. Anne]]. When 17 [[Township (Canada)|townships]] were surveyed for homesteading in 1909, a land rush soon followed, with many settlers arriving over the Edson Trail. In 1910, the Grande Prairie Townsite was sub-divided. By 1912, it included a bank, hotel, post office, and land office, making it a district metropolis. In 1916, it became the terminus of the [[Edmonton, Dunvegan and British Columbia Railway]] from Edmonton.\n\nThe Edson Trail from [[Edson, Alberta|Edson]] to Grande Prairie was opened in 1911 as a means for settlers to reach the Grande Prairie area. It was basically nothing more than a tract of clear cut bush and forest, and thus was a very difficult route for many settlers, especially during wet weather. Because of this, large scale settlement came late compared to other major farming regions further south in Canada. Grande Prairie was incorporated as a village by the Province of Alberta in 1914. It was not until the arrival of the railway in 1916 that farmland quickly expanded as waves of settlers came into the Peace region. This drove up Grande Prairie's population past the 1,000 mark, allowing it to incorporate as a town on March 27, 1919. A local [[Depression of 1920\u201321|recession in the 1920s]] caused a temporary depopulation of Grande Prairie. But the population rebounded afterwards by the 1930s, by which time the population had reached 1,464. Settlement continued unabated even into the 1930s during the [[Dust Bowl]] era because the Peace Region was able to escape the severe drought conditions that plagued the [[Canadian Prairies]] further south at the time.<ref>David W.

Although Dawson Creek was chosen as the major starting point of the construction of the [[Alaska Highway]], Grande Prairie was a major stopover point for military aircraft during the war, and benefited economically from this.\n\nAlthough Grande Prairie was well located in the southern edge of the Peace Country, it was competing with the towns of [[Peace River, Alberta|Peace River]] and Dawson Creek for the title of the most important centre of commerce and agriculture in the region until the late 1950s, when its population growth began to outstrip these towns as oil and natural gas exploration was underway in the Peace Region, especially since the first major discovery of oil further south in [[Leduc, Alberta|Leduc]] near Edmonton in 1947 and the construction of a large pulp mill in the early 1970s.\n\nThe construction and paving of [[Alberta Highway 43|Highway 43]] (originally sections of Highways 2, 34, and 43 from the BC border to the Yellowhead Highway just west of Edmonton) in 1956 cut down on the travel time by road significantly, further enhancing Grande Prairie's accessibility and economic status. The town was incorporated as a city in 1958. At that time, its population was approximately 7,600.\n\nThe opening of the [[Procter & Gamble]] kraft [[pulp mill]] in 1972 and the discovery of the [[Elmworth]] deep basin gas field spurred an economic boom. Grande Prairie's population went from just over 12,000 in the early 1970s to over 24,000 by the time the oil boom went bust in 1981.\n\nA [[tornado]] struck the downtown area and east side of Grande Prairie on July 8, 2004. Although the tornado was considered a very weak one (F0-F1 on the [[Fujita scale]]) and the weather was not severe at the time, it was still strong enough to damage houses and flip vehicles. There were no casualties or deaths.<ref>{{cite news |title=Alberta cleaning up from tornado |url=http://www.cbc.ca/canada/story/2004/07/09/tornado_alberta040709.html |work=CBC News |date=July 9, 2004 |accessdate=January 31, 2012}}</ref>\n\n== Geography ==\n[[File:Village of Grande Prairie, Alberta.jpg|thumb|left|A view of downtown Grande Prairie, circa 1914]]\nGrande Prairie is located just north of the [[55th parallel north]], and is {{convert|465|km|abbr=on}} northwest of Edmonton, lying at an elevation of {{convert|669|m|abbr=on}} above sea level. The city is surrounded by farmland to the north, east, and west. To the south lies a vast [[Taiga|boreal forest]] with aspen, tamarack, lodgepole pine, jack pine, and black spruce extending well into the foothills of the [[Canadian Rockies]] south and southwest of the city.\n\nBear Creek goes through the city from the northwest to the south end and is a tributary of the [[Wapiti River]] to the south. The Bear Creek Reservoir is the small body of water by [[Grande Prairie Regional College]] in the northwest part of the city, and is ringed by marshy wetland. The terrain immediately surrounding Grande Prairie is largely flat to gently rolling, but rises gradually to hilly terrain closer to the foothills to the south and southwest. On clear days, some peaks in the Rockies are visible to the southwest from Grande Prairie.\n\nThe city lies on the southern edge of [[aspen parkland]], which is a [[ecotone|transitional biome]] between boreal forest and [[prairie]]. The [[Peace River Country]] contains the northernmost area of aspen parkland in North America. However, much of the aspen parkland in the region has long since been destroyed by extensive farming and oil/gas drilling activity.\n\n=== Climate ===\nGrande Prairie has a northern continental climate typical of northwestern [[Alberta]] and northeastern [[British Columbia]], classified as [[Humid continental climate|humid continental]] (''Dfb''), bordering closely on a [[subarctic climate]] (''Dfc'') with old data under the [[K\u00f6ppen climate classification]]. Winters are generally very cold with some mild spells. Summers are often fairly cool to pleasantly warm in the daytime, but nights can be cool despite the long summer days typical for its latitude. Hot days over {{convert|30|C}} are rare, occurring on average only two to three days a year, which is not unexpected this far north. Winter conditions can vary tremendously from year to year. Winters have been known to be mild enough to produce \"brown Christmas\" conditions, where little or no snow may fall until after Christmas due to unusually mild early winter conditions.\n\nThe average January temperature is {{convert|\u221213.6|C|1}}, while the average July temperature is {{convert|16.2|C|1}}. However, temperatures as low as {{convert|\u221252.2|C|0}} and as high as {{convert|35.6|C|0}}<ref name=\"CCN\"/> have been recorded; the extreme [[humidex]] and [[wind chill]] readings are {{convert|40.8|and|\u221263.0|C|0}}, respectively. The city receives {{convert|445|mm|abbr=on}} of precipitation annually, including {{convert|322|mm|abbr=on}} of rain and {{convert|154|cm|abbr=on}} of snow. Snowfall amounts, however, vary greatly from year to year. Being fairly close to the foothills of the [[Canadian Rockies]], it can get quite windy in Grande Prairie, especially in the spring and fall. [[Chinook wind|Chinooks]] may occur in and bring winter thaws to the Grande Prairie area.\nGrande Prairie has 314 days with measureable sunshine per year on average, and just above 2,200 hours of bright sunshine or about 46.1% of possible sunshine, ranging from a low of 31.2% in November to a high of 59.1% in July.<ref name = climate/>\n\nSummers can bring thunderstorms, although they are not as frequent nor as severe as those further south in [[Central Alberta]]. Rainfall can vary from year to year, but the Peace Region is noted for never{{citation needed|date=February 2013}} having experienced truly severe drought conditions more typical of [[Southern Alberta]] and neighbouring [[Saskatchewan]]. Tornadoes are rare but not unheard of in the Peace Region and, as noted above, a weak tornado actually struck the core of the city in 2004.\n\n{{Weather box\n|location = [[Grande Prairie Airport]],

Major industries include oil and gas, agriculture, forestry, and food services.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://issuu.com/cityofgp/docs/city_of_grande_prairie_economic_pro_17dcdbee1af8ec/1?ff=true&e=2784359/47593705 |title=2017 Economic Profile |publisher=Department of Economic Development: City of Grande Prairie |type=PDF |pages=33-39 (PDF pages 33-39) |date=March 2017 |accessdate=November 23, 2017}}</ref>\n\nAgriculture was the first economic mainstay of Grande Prairie since settlement began in the early 20th century. It remains part of the local economy today. A variety of crops such as [[barley]], [[wheat]], [[canola]], and [[oat]]s are grown in the area. [[Livestock]] such as [[cattle]] and [[bison|buffalo (bison)]] are also raised in the area. Despite being north of the [[55th parallel north|55th parallel]], the climate is mild enough to allow for farming on a large scale to prosper. Longer daylight hours during the summer at this latitude aid in crop production. The Peace Country is the northernmost major farming region in [[North America]]. Land within the region is still being cleared for new farmland.\n\nAlthough some oil and gas drilling has been ongoing in the area since the 1950s, oil and gas exploration did not begin to occur on a large scale until the late 1970s. It was in the mid to late-1970s that the Elmworth gas field was discovered and developed, causing the city to grow rapidly until the oil boom ended in 1981.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.cityofgp.com/index.aspx?page=667&from=mm |title=History of Grande Prairie |publisher= City of Grande Prairie |accessdate=2014-11-23}}</ref> Today Grande Prairie's location atop both the [[Montney Formation|Montney]] and [[Duvernay Formation|Duvernay]] geological formations have seen local extraction activities focused on [[natural-gas condensate]] and [[shale gas]].

[[International Paper]] (formerly [[Weyerhaeuser|Weyerhaeuser Canada]]) [[Kraft process|kraft]] pulp mill, opened in 1972 by [[Procter & Gamble]], is one of Grande Prairie's largest employers. [[Canfor]] runs a sawmill and lumber yard operation on the west side of the city. [[Norbord]] (formerly Ainsworth) [[oriented strand board]] plant opened in late 1995.\n\nGrande Prairie serves as the economic and transportation hub for a trading area of nearly 250,000 people. Grande Prairie is also on the [[CANAMEX Corridor|CANAMEX]] trade route linking Canada, the United States, and Mexico.\n\n== Arts and culture ==\nLive music can be found in several downtown bars and intermittently at all-ages locations such as Tito's Restaurant and the GP Curling Club.

The event was televised nationally on [[CBC Television]]. Hundreds of performers competed in the events and the city gained status and recognition as a result. The city played host to the [[2010 Arctic Winter Games]] from March 6\u201313, 2010.\n\nThere are a number of parks in Grande Prairie, including the large Muskoseepi Park in the Bear Creek valley which winds its way throughout the city. Muskoseepi Park has excellent bike trails extending nearly the entire length of Bear Creek, from the northwest to the southeast of the city. The park also contains the Ernie Radbourne Pavilion, the outdoor Bear Creek Swimming Pool and the outdoor Muskoseepi Park Pond which converts into a skating rink in the winter.\n\nCrystal Lake in the northeast part of the city also has parkland, preserved wetlands (great for birdwatching), and walking/bike paths around its entire circumference.\n\nNestled within spruce and pine trees, on the south east side of the city, just a couple of minutes from downtown, is Evergreen Park. The park and facilities are home to the annual [[Grande Prairie Stompede]] event, which draws upwards of 30,000 people annually. The park is the largest full featured exhibition facility north of Edmonton, and can cater to upwards of 10,000 people at a time. It has a restaurant (open daily) and a lounge, and hosts events such as agricultural shows, rodeos, chuckwagon races, horse racing, sportsman and RV shows. A variety of halls, convention spaces and conference facilities all with paved parking are available. The largest building, the Entrec Centre has {{convert|105,000|sqft|abbr=on}} of space, with a {{convert|46,000|sqft|abbr=on}} main hall, and has hosted many concerts and trade shows in the past. Evergreen Park also has a 76 spot RV and Marine Campground which is open in the summer from May to October, as well as an archery centre, an equestrian facility, and 12 baseball diamonds.\n\nGrande Prairie has three 18-hole golf courses, The Dunes Golf and Winter Club, the Bear Creek Golf Club, and the Grande Prairie Golf and Country Club.

Aside from skiing, Nitehawk also has the only North American natural luge track certified for international events,{{fact|date=April 2019}} and over the summer months freestyle ski jumpers practice using the Northern Extreme water ramp facility.{{fact|date=April 2019}} It is also active in [[luge]] as a [[refrigeration|naturally refrigerated]] venue, hosting the [[FIL World Luge Natural Track Championships]] in [[FIL World Luge Natural Track Championships 2007|2007]].\n\nCross-country skiing is also common during the winter. The Wapiti Nordic Ski Club is one of Canada's premier cross country skiing and biathlon facilities,{{fact|date=April 2019}} and is just south of the city. There are over {{convert|35|km|abbr=on}} of both classical and skate skiing trails, as well as {{convert|4.5|km|abbr=on}} of nightly lit trails. There are also snowshoe trails as well as dog friendly trails. In the summer, the trails are used for hiking, mountain biking, and running.\n\nThe foothills south of Grande Prairie and around [[Grande Cache]] are visited year-round for hiking in the summer and for snowmobiling and other winter sports in the winter. [[Kakwa Wildland Park]] on the Alberta-BC border, about {{convert|180|km|abbr=on}} south of the city, is a mountainous natural area and is known for the Kakwa Falls.\n\nOn the South side of the city, off of Resources Road, is the Wapiti Shooters Club. The club was founded in 1949, and due to the many upgrades over the years is considered one of the finest shooting clubs in Alberta. It offers Shotgun (Trap, Sporting Clays, and Skeet), Handgun (outdoor 12 lanes, indoor 6 lanes), and a {{convert|200|m|abbr=on}} outdoor covered rifle range. The club is also used for business functions, birthday parties, RCMP, Sheriff, and Safety training. Over the years many top level coaches and athletes from all over Canada have trained or entered into events at the club. In addition, the club is currently developing a long ({{convert|1000|m|abbr=on}}) rifle range suitable for high power rifles, north of the city.\n\nGrande Prairie also has a new and modern, $110 million, {{convert|450,000|sqft|abbr=on}} health and fitness facility known as the Eastlink Centre, (previously known as the Multiplex). It is a large indoor fitness facility that has two indoor pools (a 50-meter Olympic sized pool, and a 25-meter, wheelchair accessible, higher temperature, Program Pool), a splash park, a lazy river, waterslides, and a surf simulator. It also includes a large weight room, squash and racquetball courts, fitness classes, a daycare service, a multi-use basketball court, a summer outdoor 5,000 sq. ft. concrete skateboard park,  and additional other amenities and classes. The Eastlink Centre is located in southwest Grande Prairie and connects St. Joseph High School, the Grande Prairie Gymnastics Centre, and the Coca-Cola Centre.<ref>{{cite web|title=About the Facility|url=http://www.eastlinkcentre.ca/about/about-the-facility|accessdate=22 February 2013}}</ref> In March 2012 the Eastlink Centre received an award for its exceptional accessibility features.<ref>{{cite web|title=Eastlink Centre Honoured For Accessibility Features|url=http://www.eastlinkcentre.ca/images/stories/pdf/media/news_release_eastlink%20centre%20award.pdf|accessdate=22 February 2013}}</ref>\n\nThe Outdoor Bear Creek Swimming Pool, in Muskoseepi Park, was reopened in the summer of 2019, after extensive modifications.  The new renovations include a Tots Pool, a Zero Beach, Spanish Steps, Lily Islands, a Games Area, and a Waterslide.\n\nThe Leisure Centre (previously known as the Rec-Plex) is located in northwest Grande Prairie near the Bear Creek Reservoir. In December 2011, after the Eastlink Centre opened, the majority of the Leisure Centre was closed, with unrealized plans to reopen in the second half of 2013.<ref>{{cite web|title=The Leisure Centre|url=http://www.cityofgp.com/index.aspx?page=157|accessdate=22 February 2013}}</ref> Currently the swimming pool and gym remain closed, but the indoor soccer pitch is open for a variety of sports.\n\nOver the years Grande Prairie has played host to many tournaments including:\n*[[2004 Royal Bank Cup]]\n*[[2006 Ford World Women's Curling Championship]]\n*[[2009 Players' Championship]]\n*[[2010 Arctic Winter Games]]\n*[[2011 Players' Championship]]\n*[[2012 Pomeroy Inn & Suites Prairie Showdown]] ([[Pomeroy Inn & Suites Prairie Showdown]])\n*[[2013 Pomeroy Inn & Suites Prairie Showdown]]\n*[[2015 Canada Cup of Curling]]\n*[[2016 Scotties Tournament of Hearts]]\n\n\nThe city also has the following ice hockey teams:\n\n{|class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|+ <!-- initially sorted by date established -->\n|-\n! scope=\"col\" |Club\n! scope=\"col\" |League\n! scope=\"col\" |Sport\n! scope=\"col\" |Venue\n! scope=\"col\" |Established\n! scope=\"col\" |Championships\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" style=\"font-weight: normal;\" |[[Grande Prairie Storm]]\n| style=\"text-align: center;\" | [[Alberta Junior Hockey League|AJHL]]\n|[[Ice hockey]]\n|[[Revolution Place]]\n| style=\"text-align: center;\" | 1966 <br/> <small></small>\n| style=\"text-align: center;\" | 3\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" style=\"font-weight: normal;\" |[[Grande Prairie Kings]]\n| style=\"text-align: center;\" | [[North West Junior Hockey League|NWJHL]]\n|[[Ice hockey]]\n| Crosslink County Sportsplex\n| style=\"text-align: center;\" | 1994 <br/> <small></small>\n| style=\"text-align: center;\" | 1\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" style=\"font-weight: normal;\" |[[Grande Prairie Athletics]]\n| style=\"text-align: center;\" | [[North Peace Hockey League|NPHL]]\n|[[Ice hockey]]\n| Crosslink County Sportsplex\n| style=\"text-align: center;\" | 1960 <br/> <small></small>\n| style=\"text-align: center;\" | 7\n|}\n\n== Transportation ==\n====Air====\nThe [[Grande Prairie Airport]] is located at the west end of the city and serves the region with daily scheduled flights to [[Calgary]] and [[Edmonton]]. Two airlines, [[Air Canada Express]] and [[WestJet Encore]], offer service to the airport. The airport has seen growth in both passenger and aircraft traffic in recent years, and now serves just under a half a million passengers annually. The Grande Prairie Airport was originally developed in the 1930s as a grass only strip at its present site. In 1941 in support of the war effort, and the building of the Alaska Highway, the facility was expanded for utilization by the [[Royal Canadian Air Force]] and the [[United States Air Force]]. In 1950 the airport came under the authority of the [[Government of Canada|Federal Government]] until February 1, 1997, at which time it was transferred to the City of Grande Prairie.<ref>{{cite web|title=History of the Grande Prairie Airport|url=http://grandeprairieairport.com/airport-information-101/history-2/|accessdate=1 August 2015}}</ref>\n\nThe terminal, built in 1981, was renovated in 2009 making it twice its original size. In 2014, one of the two asphalt runways was extended from {{convert|6501|ft|abbr=on}} to {{convert|8502|ft|abbr=on}} (the other is {{convert|6200|ft|abbr=on}}). Forthcoming expansions include an upgrade to the parking system. Currently the airport has no customs capabilities (although a temporary customs facility was set up for the 2010 Arctic Winter Games). <ref>{{Cite web|url=http://grandeprairieairport.com/airport-information/media-publications/most-new-airport-measures-wont-impact-grande-prairie/|title=March 8 2010 Most new airport measures won't impact Grande Prairie {{!}} Grande Prairie Airport|language=en-US|access-date=2019-02-26}}</ref>\n\n[[Swanberg Air]] formerly operated out of the airport until they ceased operations in 2011. They flew cargo, scheduled, and charter passenger services in Alberta, Saskatchewan, and British Columbia.\n\n====City public transit====\n[[Grande Prairie Transit]] is a small public transit system with modern buses and a route system integrated throughout the city.\n\n====Intercity bus====\n[[Greyhound Canada]] offered scheduled bus service from its Grande Prairie terminal to Edmonton and [[Dawson Creek]]. This service was terminated in October 2018. [[Pacific Western Transportation#Red Arrow Motorcoach|Red Arrow]] now connects Grande Prairie to Edmonton.\n\n====Highways and roads====\n[[Alberta Highway 43|Highway 43]] is the main highway through the city providing eventual connection to British Columbia to the west and Edmonton to the southeast. Highway 43 meets [[Alberta Highway 2|Highway 2]] a few kilometres north of the city at an intersection known locally as Four Mile Corner, then continues south into the city. It travels through the city via a northwest bypass and exits the city on the west end near the airport.\n\nThe stretch of [[Alberta Highway 2|Highway 2]] extending north from Grande Prairie to Four Mile Corner and west to the Alberta/BC border was renumbered to Highway 43 in the late 1990s to link with the rest of Highway 43 from Four Mile Corner to the [[Yellowhead Highway]] just west of Edmonton. This explains why newer maps no longer show that stretch west and a few&nbsp;km north of the city as Highway 2. The renumbering was also partly due to Highway 43 now being a part of the CANAMEX trade route and also due to it being widened to a four-lane divided highway for most of its length, the remaining two-lane undivided portion beginning 1.6 km east of the Highway 723 junction. [[Alberta Highway 40|Highway 40]] is the primary access road into Grande Prairie from the south.\n\nConstruction of a new [[Alberta Highway 43#Grande Prairie bypass|Highway 43X]] bypass will skirt the northwest side of the city from Four Mile Corner to Highway 43 just west of where the airport was begun in August 2007<ref>{{cite web|url= http://www.gov.ab.ca/acn/200708/21983B2544DD5-0D52-9623-579D3412290C6789.html |title= Construction starts on long-awaited Grande Prairie bypass|author= Alberta Infrastructure and Transportation |accessdate= 2007-09-04}}</ref> (\"Four Mile Corner\" is not an actual settlement - it is an intersection so-named because it is {{convert|4|mi|abbr=on}} north of the intersection of Clairmont Road (100th Street) and Richmond Avenue (100th Avenue)). The construction is in two phases, with the first phase under construction and the second currently in the design stage. The first phase extends west to Range Road 63 (116 Street within city limits), while the second phase runs west from Range Road 63 south to Highway 43 west of the airport. This future bypass is intended to replace the current one. The current bypass, which was built in the late 1960s, is no longer functioning well, due to high traffic volumes and new intersections. The rapid population growth of Grande Prairie is contributing to such a high increase in vehicle traffic that traffic jams are now relatively common during peak hours.\n\nGrande Prairie sees many vacationers heading to the [[Alaska Highway]] by road during the summer because Highway 43 leads towards [[Dawson Creek]], BC, which is the \"Mile 0\" of the Alaska Highway.\n\n====Rail====\nThe City of Grande Prairie has rail freight service provided by [[Canadian National Railway|CN]]. Trackage runs south from Grande Prairie to [[Grande Cache]] and [[Hinton, Alberta|Hinton]], where it joins CN's main transcontinental line. CN also operates local freight service out of Grande Prairie on former [[Northern Alberta Railways]] tracks - north to [[Sexsmith, Alberta|Sexsmith]] and [[Rycroft, Alberta|Rycroft]], and west to [[Beaverlodge]] and [[Hythe, Alberta|Hythe]].\n\n[[Savage Alberta Railway]], which operated from 1999 to 2006, was owned by [[North American RailNet]] and had its headquarters in the city prior to being purchased by CN.\n\n== Education ==\n=== Elementary and secondary schools ===\nFour school districts operate schools within Grande Prairie.<ref>{{cite web|url=

The city is surrounded by the [[County of Grande Prairie No. 1]].\n\nGrande Prairie was the [[List of cities in Alberta|seventh-largest city in Alberta]] in 2016 with a population of 63,166,<ref name=2016censusABmunis/> and was one of Canada's fastest growing cities between 2001 and 2006.<ref name=2006highest>{{cite web |url=http://www12.statcan.ca/census-recensement/2006/dp-pd/hlt/97-550/Index.cfm?TPL=P1C&Page=RETR&LANG=Eng&T=307&SR=1&S=5&O=D |title=Population and dwelling counts, for Canada and census subdivisions (municipalities) with 5,000-plus population, 2006 and 2001 censuses - 100% data |publisher=Statistics Canada |date=2010-01-06 |accessdate=2012-10-28}}</ref>\n\nThe city adopted the [[trumpeter swan]] as an official symbol due to its proximity to the migration route and summer nesting grounds of this bird. For that reason, Grande Prairie is sometimes nicknamed the \"Swan City\". The dinosaur has emerged as an unofficial symbol of the city due to paleontology discoveries in the areas north and west of the Grande Prairie.\n\n== History ==\n\nGrande Prairie was named for the large prairie which lies to the north, east, and west of it. In the 18th century, the prairie was occupied by bands of the [[Dane-zaa]] (Beaver) peoples, who began trading with the [[North West Company]] at [[Dunvegan, Alberta|Dunvegan]] in the early 19th century. The earliest recorded reference to the prairie was by trader [[Samuel Black]] in 1824. In 1880, a [[Hudson's Bay Company]] post called La Grande Prairie was established by George Kennedy {{convert|15|mi|abbr=on}} northwest of the present city. In the late 19th century, the prairie was settled by [[Cree]] and [[Iroquois]] from around [[Jasper, Alberta|Jasper]] and [[Lac Ste. Anne (Alberta)|Lac Ste. Anne]]. When 17 [[Township (Canada)|townships]] were surveyed for homesteading in 1909, a land rush soon followed, with many settlers arriving over the Edson Trail. In 1910, the Grande Prairie Townsite was sub-divided. By 1912, it included a bank, hotel, post office, and land office, making it a district metropolis. In 1916, it became the terminus of the [[Edmonton, Dunvegan and British Columbia Railway]] from Edmonton.\n\nThe Edson Trail from [[Edson, Alberta|Edson]] to Grande Prairie was opened in 1911 as a means for settlers to reach the Grande Prairie area. It was basically nothing more than a tract of clear cut bush and forest, and thus was a very difficult route for many settlers, especially during wet weather. Because of this, large scale settlement came late compared to other major farming regions further south in Canada. Grande Prairie was incorporated as a village by the Province of Alberta in 1914. It was not until the arrival of the railway in 1916 that farmland quickly expanded as waves of settlers came into the Peace region. This drove up Grande Prairie's population past the 1,000 mark, allowing it to incorporate as a town on March 27, 1919. A local [[Depression of 1920\u201321|recession in the 1920s]] caused a temporary depopulation of Grande Prairie. But the population rebounded afterwards by the 1930s, by which time the population had reached 1,464. Settlement continued unabated even into the 1930s during the [[Dust Bowl]] era because the Peace Region was able to escape the severe drought conditions that plagued the [[Canadian Prairies]] further south at the time.<ref>David W.

Although Dawson Creek was chosen as the major starting point of the construction of the [[Alaska Highway]], Grande Prairie was a major stopover point for military aircraft during the war, and benefited economically from this.\n\nAlthough Grande Prairie was well located in the southern edge of the Peace Country, it was competing with the towns of [[Peace River, Alberta|Peace River]] and Dawson Creek for the title of the most important centre of commerce and agriculture in the region until the late 1950s, when its population growth began to outstrip these towns as oil and natural gas exploration was underway in the Peace Region, especially since the first major discovery of oil further south in [[Leduc, Alberta|Leduc]] near Edmonton in 1947 and the construction of a large pulp mill in the early 1970s.\n\nThe construction and paving of [[Alberta Highway 43|Highway 43]] (originally sections of Highways 2, 34, and 43 from the BC border to the Yellowhead Highway just west of Edmonton) in 1956 cut down on the travel time by road significantly, further enhancing Grande Prairie's accessibility and economic status. The town was incorporated as a city in 1958. At that time, its population was approximately 7,600.\n\nThe opening of the [[Procter & Gamble]] kraft [[pulp mill]] in 1972 and the discovery of the [[Elmworth]] deep basin gas field spurred an economic boom. Grande Prairie's population went from just over 12,000 in the early 1970s to over 24,000 by the time the oil boom went bust in 1981.\n\nA [[tornado]] struck the downtown area and east side of Grande Prairie on July 8, 2004. Although the tornado was considered a very weak one (F0-F1 on the [[Fujita scale]]) and the weather was not severe at the time, it was still strong enough to damage houses and flip vehicles. There were no casualties or deaths.<ref>{{cite news |title=Alberta cleaning up from tornado |url=http://www.cbc.ca/canada/story/2004/07/09/tornado_alberta040709.html |work=CBC News |date=July 9, 2004 |accessdate=January 31, 2012}}</ref>\n\n== Geography ==\n[[File:Village of Grande Prairie, Alberta.jpg|thumb|left|A view of downtown Grande Prairie, circa 1914]]\nGrande Prairie is located just north of the [[55th parallel north]], and is {{convert|465|km|abbr=on}} northwest of Edmonton, lying at an elevation of {{convert|669|m|abbr=on}} above sea level. The city is surrounded by farmland to the north, east, and west. To the south lies a vast [[Taiga|boreal forest]] with aspen, tamarack, lodgepole pine, jack pine, and black spruce extending well into the foothills of the [[Canadian Rockies]] south and southwest of the city.\n\nBear Creek goes through the city from the northwest to the south end and is a tributary of the [[Wapiti River]] to the south. The Bear Creek Reservoir is the small body of water by [[Grande Prairie Regional College]] in the northwest part of the city, and is ringed by marshy wetland. The terrain immediately surrounding Grande Prairie is largely flat to gently rolling, but rises gradually to hilly terrain closer to the foothills to the south and southwest. On clear days, some peaks in the Rockies are visible to the southwest from Grande Prairie.\n\nThe city lies on the southern edge of [[aspen parkland]], which is a [[ecotone|transitional biome]] between boreal forest and [[prairie]]. The [[Peace River Country]] contains the northernmost area of aspen parkland in North America. However, much of the aspen parkland in the region has long since been destroyed by extensive farming and oil/gas drilling activity.\n\n=== Climate ===\nGrande Prairie has a northern continental climate typical of northwestern [[Alberta]] and northeastern [[British Columbia]], classified as [[Humid continental climate|humid continental]] (''Dfb''), bordering closely on a [[subarctic climate]] (''Dfc'') with old data under the [[K\u00f6ppen climate classification]]. Winters are generally very cold with some mild spells. Summers are often fairly cool to pleasantly warm in the daytime, but nights can be cool despite the long summer days typical for its latitude. Hot days over {{convert|30|C}} are rare, occurring on average only two to three days a year, which is not unexpected this far north. Winter conditions can vary tremendously from year to year. Winters have been known to be mild enough to produce \"brown Christmas\" conditions, where little or no snow may fall until after Christmas due to unusually mild early winter conditions.\n\nThe average January temperature is {{convert|\u221213.6|C|1}}, while the average July temperature is {{convert|16.2|C|1}}. However, temperatures as low as {{convert|\u221252.2|C|0}} and as high as {{convert|35.6|C|0}}<ref name=\"CCN\"/> have been recorded; the extreme [[humidex]] and [[wind chill]] readings are {{convert|40.8|and|\u221263.0|C|0}}, respectively. The city receives {{convert|445|mm|abbr=on}} of precipitation annually, including {{convert|322|mm|abbr=on}} of rain and {{convert|154|cm|abbr=on}} of snow. Snowfall amounts, however, vary greatly from year to year. Being fairly close to the foothills of the [[Canadian Rockies]], it can get quite windy in Grande Prairie, especially in the spring and fall. [[Chinook wind|Chinooks]] may occur in and bring winter thaws to the Grande Prairie area.\nGrande Prairie has 314 days with measureable sunshine per year on average, and just above 2,200 hours of bright sunshine or about 46.1% of possible sunshine, ranging from a low of 31.2% in November to a high of 59.1% in July.<ref name = climate/>\n\nSummers can bring thunderstorms, although they are not as frequent nor as severe as those further south in [[Central Alberta]]. Rainfall can vary from year to year, but the Peace Region is noted for never{{citation needed|date=February 2013}} having experienced truly severe drought conditions more typical of [[Southern Alberta]] and neighbouring [[Saskatchewan]]. Tornadoes are rare but not unheard of in the Peace Region and, as noted above, a weak tornado actually struck the core of the city in 2004.\n\n{{Weather box\n|location = [[Grande Prairie Airport]],

It remains part of the local economy today. A variety of crops such as [[barley]], [[wheat]], [[canola]], and [[oat]]s are grown in the area. [[Livestock]] such as [[cattle]] and [[bison|buffalo (bison)]] are also raised in the area. Despite being north of the [[55th parallel north|55th parallel]], the climate is mild enough to allow for farming on a large scale to prosper. Longer daylight hours during the summer at this latitude aid in crop production. The Peace Country is the northernmost major farming region in [[North America]]. Land within the region is still being cleared for new farmland.\n\nAlthough some oil and gas drilling has been ongoing in the area since the 1950s, oil and gas exploration did not begin to occur on a large scale until the late 1970s. It was in the mid to late-1970s that the Elmworth gas field was discovered and developed, causing the city to grow rapidly until the oil boom ended in 1981.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.cityofgp.com/index.aspx?page=667&from=mm |title=History of Grande Prairie |publisher= City of Grande Prairie |accessdate=2014-11-23}}</ref> Today Grande Prairie\u2019s location atop both the [[Montney Formation|Montney]] and [[Duvernay Formation|Duvernay]] geological formations have seen local extraction activities focused on [[natural-gas condensate]] and [[shale gas]].

It is a {{convert|41,000|sqft|abbr=on}}. building with many exhibits, a National Geographic Theatre, classrooms, a Paleontology Lab, a gift shop and a restaurant. The museum is named after [[Philip J. Currie]],<ref>{{cite web |url=https://dinomuseum.ca/visit/about-the-museum/ |title=About The Museum |publisher=Phillip J. Currie Dinosaur Museum |accessdate=2017-11-23}}</ref> from the [[University of Alberta]], who has contributed to the understanding of the link between dinosaurs and birds.\n\n== Sports and recreation ==\nIn 1995, the city hosted the [[Canada Games]]. The event was televised nationally on [[CBC Television]]. Hundreds of performers competed in the events and the city gained status and recognition as a result. The city played host to the [[2010 Arctic Winter Games]] from March 6\u201313, 2010.\n\nThere are a number of parks in Grande Prairie, including the large Muskoseepi Park in the Bear Creek valley which winds its way throughout the city. Muskoseepi Park has excellent bike trails extending nearly the entire length of Bear Creek, from the northwest to the southeast of the city. The park also contains the Ernie Radbourne Pavilion, the outdoor Bear Creek Swimming Pool and the outdoor Muskoseepi Park Pond which converts into a skating rink in the winter.\n\nCrystal Lake in the northeast part of the city also has parkland, preserved wetlands (great for birdwatching), and walking/bike paths around its entire circumference.\n\nNestled within spruce and pine trees, on the south east side of the city, just a couple of minutes from downtown, is Evergreen Park. The park and facilities are home to the annual [[Grande Prairie Stompede]] event, which draws upwards of 30,000 people annually. The park is the largest full featured exhibition facility north of Edmonton, and can cater to upwards of 10,000 people at a time. It has a restaurant (open daily) and a lounge, and hosts events such as agricultural shows, rodeos, chuckwagon races, horse racing, sportsman and RV shows. A variety of halls, convention spaces and conference facilities all with paved parking are available. The largest building, the Entrec Centre has {{convert|105,000|sqft|abbr=on}} of space, with a {{convert|46,000|sqft|abbr=on}} main hall, and has hosted many concerts and trade shows in the past. Evergreen Park also has a 76 spot RV and Marine Campground which is open in the summer from May to October, as well as an archery centre, an equestrian facility, and 12 baseball diamonds.\n\nGrande Prairie has three 18-hole golf courses, The Dunes Golf and Winter Club, the Bear Creek Golf Club, and the Grande Prairie Golf and Country Club. A fourth golf course, Grovedale Golf Course, is also located approximately {{convert|20|km|abbr=on}} to the southwest of the city.<ref name=golfcourses>{{cite web |url=http://www.discoverthepeacecountry.com/htmlpages/golf.html |title=Grande Prairie \u2013 Golf |publisher=Discover the Peace Country Visitors Guide |accessdate=January 24, 2014}}</ref>\n\nEarly in 2017, a new nine hole course, ''The Bear Paw Golf Course'', with a par level of 3 opened up in the ''South Bear Creek Recreation Area.''<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.cityofgp.com/index.aspx?page=506 |title=Bear Paw Par |publisher=City of Grande Prairie |accessdate=November 23, 2017}}</ref>\n\n[[Alpine skiing|Downhill skiing]] is popular in Grande Prairie,{{fact|date=April 2019}} which has a local ski hill called Nitehawk and is located south of the city on the south bank of the Wapiti River. Aside from skiing, Nitehawk also has the only North American natural luge track certified for international events,{{fact|date=April 2019}} and over the summer months freestyle ski jumpers practice using the Northern Extreme water ramp facility.{{fact|date=April 2019}} It is also active in [[luge]] as a [[refrigeration|naturally refrigerated]] venue, hosting the [[FIL World Luge Natural Track Championships]] in [[FIL World Luge Natural Track Championships 2007|2007]].\n\nCross-country skiing is also common during the winter. The Wapiti Nordic Ski Club is one of Canada's premier cross country skiing and biathlon facilities,{{fact|date=April 2019}} and is just south of the city. There are over {{convert|35|km|abbr=on}} of both classical and skate skiing trails, as well as {{convert|4.5|km|abbr=on}} of nightly lit trails. There are also snowshoe trails as well as dog friendly trails. In the summer, the trails are used for hiking, mountain biking, and running.\n\nThe foothills south of Grande Prairie and around [[Grande Cache]] are visited year-round for hiking in the summer and for snowmobiling and other winter sports in the winter. [[Kakwa Wildland Park]] on the Alberta-BC border, about {{convert|180|km|abbr=on}} south of the city, is a mountainous natural area and is known for the Kakwa Falls.\n\nOn the South side of the city, off of Resources Road, is the Wapiti Shooters Club. The club was founded in 1949, and due to the many upgrades over the years is considered one of the finest shooting clubs in Alberta. It offers Shotgun (Trap, Sporting Clays, and Skeet), Handgun (outdoor 12 lanes, indoor 6 lanes), and a {{convert|200|m|abbr=on}} outdoor covered rifle range. The club is also used for business functions, birthday parties, RCMP, Sheriff, and Safety training. Over the years many top level coaches and athletes from all over Canada have trained or entered into events at the club. In addition, the club is currently developing a long ({{convert|1000|m|abbr=on}}) rifle range suitable for high power rifles, north of the city.\n\nGrande Prairie also has a new and modern, $110 million, {{convert|450,000|sqft|abbr=on}} health and fitness facility known as the Eastlink Centre, (previously known as the Multiplex). It is a large indoor fitness facility that has two indoor pools (a 50-meter Olympic sized pool, and a 25-meter, wheelchair accessible, higher temperature, Program Pool), a splash park, a lazy river, waterslides, and a surf simulator. It also includes a large weight room, squash and racquetball courts, fitness classes, a daycare service, a multi-use basketball court, a summer outdoor 5,000 sq. ft. concrete skateboard park,  and additional other amenities and classes. The Eastlink Centre is located in southwest Grande Prairie and connects St. Joseph High School, the Grande Prairie Gymnastics Centre, and the Coca-Cola Centre.<ref>{{cite web|title=About the Facility|url=http://www.eastlinkcentre.ca/about/about-the-facility|accessdate=22 February 2013}}</ref> In March 2012 the Eastlink Centre received an award for its exceptional accessibility features.<ref>{{cite web|title=Eastlink Centre Honoured For Accessibility Features|url=http://www.eastlinkcentre.ca/images/stories/pdf/media/news_release_eastlink%20centre%20award.pdf|accessdate=22 February 2013}}</ref>\n\nThe Outdoor Bear Creek Swimming Pool, in Muskoseepi Park, was reopened in the summer of 2019, after extensive modifications.  The new renovations include a Tots Pool, a Zero Beach, Spanish Steps, Lily Islands, a Games Area, and a Waterslide.\n\nThe Leisure Centre (previously known as the Rec-Plex) is located in northwest Grande Prairie near the Bear Creek Reservoir. In December 2011, after the Eastlink Centre opened, the majority of the Leisure Centre was closed, with unrealized plans to reopen in the second half of 2013.<ref>{{cite web|title=The Leisure Centre|url=http://www.cityofgp.com/index.aspx?page=157|accessdate=22 February 2013}}</ref> Currently the swimming pool and gym remain closed, but the indoor soccer pitch is open for a variety of sports.\n\nOver the years Grande Prairie has played host to many tournaments including:\n*[[2004 Royal Bank Cup]]\n*[[2006 Ford World Women's Curling Championship]]\n*[[2009 Players' Championship]]\n*[[2010 Arctic Winter Games]]\n*[[2011 Players' Championship]]\n*[[2012 Pomeroy Inn & Suites Prairie Showdown]] ([[Pomeroy Inn & Suites Prairie Showdown]])\n*[[2013 Pomeroy Inn & Suites Prairie Showdown]]\n*[[2015 Canada Cup of Curling]]\n*[[2016 Scotties Tournament of Hearts]]\n\n\nThe city also has the following ice hockey teams:\n\n{|class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|+ <!-- initially sorted by date established -->\n|-\n! scope=\"col\" |Club\n! scope=\"col\" |League\n! scope=\"col\" |Sport\n! scope=\"col\" |Venue\n! scope=\"col\" |Established\n! scope=\"col\" |Championships\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" style=\"font-weight: normal;\" |[[Grande Prairie Storm]]\n| style=\"text-align: center;\" | [[Alberta Junior Hockey League|AJHL]]\n|[[Ice hockey]]\n|[[Revolution Place]]\n| style=\"text-align: center;\" | 1966 <br/> <small></small>\n| style=\"text-align: center;\" | 3\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" style=\"font-weight: normal;\" |[[Grande Prairie Kings]]\n| style=\"text-align: center;\" | [[North West Junior Hockey League|NWJHL]]\n|[[Ice hockey]]\n| Crosslink County Sportsplex\n| style=\"text-align: center;\" | 1994 <br/> <small></small>\n| style=\"text-align: center;\" | 1\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" style=\"font-weight: normal;\" |[[Grande Prairie Athletics]]\n| style=\"text-align: center;\" | [[North Peace Hockey League|NPHL]]\n|[[Ice hockey]]\n| Crosslink County Sportsplex\n| style=\"text-align: center;\" | 1960 <br/> <small></small>\n| style=\"text-align: center;\" | 7\n|}\n\n== Transportation ==\n====Air====\nThe [[Grande Prairie Airport]] is located at the west end of the city and serves the region with daily scheduled flights to [[Calgary]] and [[Edmonton]]. Two airlines, [[Air Canada Express]] and [[WestJet Encore]], offer service to the airport. The airport has seen growth in both passenger and aircraft traffic in recent years, and now serves just under a half a million passengers annually. The Grande Prairie Airport was originally developed in the 1930s as a grass only strip at its present site. In 1941 in support of the war effort, and the building of the Alaska Highway, the facility was expanded for utilization by the [[Royal Canadian Air Force]] and the [[United States Air Force]]. In 1950 the airport came under the authority of the [[Government of Canada|Federal Government]] until February 1, 1997, at which time it was transferred to the City of Grande Prairie.<ref>{{cite web|title=History of the Grande Prairie Airport|url=http://grandeprairieairport.com/airport-information-101/history-2/|accessdate=1 August 2015}}</ref>\n\nThe terminal, built in 1981, was renovated in 2009 making it twice its original size. In 2014, one of the two asphalt runways was extended from {{convert|6501|ft|abbr=on}} to {{convert|8502|ft|abbr=on}} (the other is {{convert|6200|ft|abbr=on}}). Forthcoming expansions include an upgrade to the parking system. Currently the airport has no customs capabilities (although a temporary customs facility was set up for the 2010 Arctic Winter Games). <ref>{{Cite web|url=http://grandeprairieairport.com/airport-information/media-publications/most-new-airport-measures-wont-impact-grande-prairie/|title=March 8 2010 Most new airport measures won't impact Grande Prairie {{!}} Grande Prairie Airport|language=en-US|access-date=2019-02-26}}</ref>\n\n[[Swanberg Air]] formerly operated out of the airport until they ceased operations in 2011. They flew cargo, scheduled, and charter passenger services in Alberta, Saskatchewan, and British Columbia.\n\n====City public transit====\n[[Grande Prairie Transit]] is a small public transit system with modern buses and a route system integrated throughout the city.\n\n====Intercity bus====\n[[Greyhound Canada]] offered scheduled bus service from its Grande Prairie terminal to Edmonton and [[Dawson Creek]]. This service was terminated in October 2018. [[Pacific Western Transportation#Red Arrow Motorcoach|Red Arrow]] now connects Grande Prairie to Edmonton.\n\n====Highways and roads====\n[[Alberta Highway 43|Highway 43]] is the main highway through the city providing eventual connection to British Columbia to the west and Edmonton to the southeast. Highway 43 meets [[Alberta Highway 2|Highway 2]] a few kilometres north of the city at an intersection known locally as Four Mile Corner, then continues south into the city. It travels through the city via a northwest bypass and exits the city on the west end near the airport.\n\nThe stretch of [[Alberta Highway 2|Highway 2]] extending north from Grande Prairie to Four Mile Corner and west to the Alberta/BC border was renumbered to Highway 43 in the late 1990s to link with the rest of Highway 43 from Four Mile Corner to the [[Yellowhead Highway]] just west of Edmonton. This explains why newer maps no longer show that stretch west and a few&nbsp;km north of the city as Highway 2. The renumbering was also partly due to Highway 43 now being a part of the CANAMEX trade route and also due to it being widened to a four-lane divided highway for most of its length, the remaining two-lane undivided portion beginning 1.6 km east of the Highway 723 junction. [[Alberta Highway 40|Highway 40]] is the primary access road into Grande Prairie from the south.\n\nConstruction of a new [[Alberta Highway 43#Grande Prairie bypass|Highway 43X]] bypass will skirt the northwest side of the city from Four Mile Corner to Highway 43 just west of where the airport was begun in August 2007<ref>{{cite web|url= http://www.gov.ab.ca/acn/200708/21983B2544DD5-0D52-9623-579D3412290C6789.html |title= Construction starts on long-awaited Grande Prairie bypass|author= Alberta Infrastructure and Transportation |accessdate= 2007-09-04}}</ref> (\"Four Mile Corner\" is not an actual settlement - it is an intersection so-named because it is {{convert|4|mi|abbr=on}} north of the intersection of Clairmont Road (100th Street) and Richmond Avenue (100th Avenue)). The construction is in two phases, with the first phase under construction and the second currently in the design stage. The first phase extends west to Range Road 63 (116 Street within city limits), while the second phase runs west from Range Road 63 south to Highway 43 west of the airport. This future bypass is intended to replace the current one. The current bypass, which was built in the late 1960s, is no longer functioning well, due to high traffic volumes and new intersections. The rapid population growth of Grande Prairie is contributing to such a high increase in vehicle traffic that traffic jams are now relatively common during peak hours.\n\nGrande Prairie sees many vacationers heading to the [[Alaska Highway]] by road during the summer because Highway 43 leads towards [[Dawson Creek]], BC, which is the \"Mile 0\" of the Alaska Highway.\n\n====Rail====\nThe City of Grande Prairie has rail freight service provided by [[Canadian National Railway|CN]]. Trackage runs south from Grande Prairie to [[Grande Cache]] and [[Hinton, Alberta|Hinton]], where it joins CN's main transcontinental line. CN also operates local freight service out of Grande Prairie on former [[Northern Alberta Railways]] tracks - north to [[Sexsmith, Alberta|Sexsmith]] and [[Rycroft, Alberta|Rycroft]], and west to [[Beaverlodge]] and [[Hythe, Alberta|Hythe]].\n\n[[Savage Alberta Railway]], which operated from 1999 to 2006, was owned by [[North American RailNet]] and had its headquarters in the city prior to being purchased by CN.\n\n== Education ==\n=== Elementary and secondary schools ===\nFour school districts operate schools within Grande Prairie.<ref>{{cite web|url=

The population is 3,266. Grand Saline is the third largest city in Van Zandt County and is located roughly 75 miles (120&nbsp;km) east of [[Dallas]] and 35 miles (56&nbsp;km) northwest of [[Tyler, Texas|Tyler]], the two nearest metropolitan areas, and is part of the greater Tyler/Longview area.\n\nThe town derives its name from the large [[salt mining|salt deposit]]s located southeast of the city, the majority of which are owned by [[Morton Salt]].\n\n==History==\n{{unreferenced section|date=May 2016}}\nGrand Saline's first settlers were the ancient [[Caddo Indians]] and [[Cherokee Indians]] tribes who discovered and made use of a large salt prairie south of the town. The Native Americans used evaporated salt from the [[brine]] stream that flows over the flats as a commodity they traded for other needed goods.  By the mid-nineteenth century, the tribes had been forced out of the area by [[Mirabeau B. Lamar]], second president of the [[Republic of Texas]] and by general anti-Indian sentiment and moved southeast. Only a few years after the Indians left the salt prairie behind, a new group of settlers arrived. A settler named John Jordan and other settlers brought their families and set up a primitive salt works. The community named Jordan's Saline quickly became the center of Van Zandt County and was, for a while the county seat.\n\n[[File:Fullsizeoutput 86.jpg|thumb|Museum and Coffee Shop in Downtown Grand Saline.]]\nThe salt produced here was used in the process of tanning leather and preserving food stuffs. Following the [[American Civil War]] the [[Texas and Pacific Railroad]] was extended from Marshall to Dallas. A parcel of land was donated to the railroad and a depot was built and the stop was named Grand Saline. The City of Grand Saline was incorporated in 1895 and the community of Jordan's Saline faded into history as its residents moved north to the bustling new city.\n\n[[File:Fullsizeoutput 7e.jpg|thumb|Historic Grand Saline Main Street Neighborhood.]]\n\nThere were formerly numerous salt companies in Grand Saline, including the Richardson Salt works, which had drilled the first salt well; the Lone Star Salt Company, Kleer Salt Works, the first steam powered salt plant; and the Grand Saline Salt Company which later became the Morton Salt Company. During the late 1920s, the discovery of the nearby [[Van, Texas]] oil field brought companies that provided needed supplies. In the 1930s Grand Saline had twelve petroleum supply companies and five lumber companies. In the Depression years, local sewing rooms made garments for the poor. During [[World War II]], a worker's strike at Morton Salt led the town to form the Grand Saline Industrial Foundation to attract new business to town. Their efforts produced clothing manufacturers, sulfur processing and meat packing companies.  Grand Saline was also known for its Lone Star Hotel which was, for a brief time, the home of Hollywood starlet [[Louise Fazenda]], the wife of Warner Brothers executive [[Hal Wallis]]. Agriculture, farming, and ranching have long been a major part of the economic life in Grand Saline. Crops have included sweet potatoes and other truck crops. A cotton gin built south of town in 1890 marked the beginning of many years of cotton production. Poultry, livestock, dairy products, lumber and an [[Ice house (building)|Ice House]] all played a role in the formation and history of the town.\n\n==Geography==\n[[File:Fullsizeoutput 7a.jpg|thumb|Downtown Grand Saline]]\n\nGrand Saline is located at {{coord|32|40|40|N|95|42|41|W|type:city}} (32.677662, -95.711521),<ref name=\"GR1\">{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/geo/www/gazetteer/gazette.html|publisher=[[United States Census Bureau]]|accessdate=2011-04-23|date=2011-02-12|title=US Gazetteer files: 2010, 2000, and 1990}}</ref> in the northeastern area of Van Zandt County, at the intersection of [[Texas State Highway 110]] and [[U.S. Route 80]] in western [[East Texas]].

The population is 3,266. Grand Saline is the third largest city in Van Zandt County and is located roughly 75 miles (120&nbsp;km) east of [[Dallas]] and 35 miles (56&nbsp;km) northwest of [[Tyler, Texas|Tyler]], the two nearest metropolitan areas, and is part of the greater Tyler/Longview area.\n\nThe town derives its name from the large [[salt mining|salt deposit]]s located southeast of the city, the majority of which are owned by [[Morton Salt]].\n\n==History==\n{{unreferenced section|date=May 2016}}\nGrand Saline's first settlers were the ancient [[Caddo Indians]] and [[Cherokee Indians]] tribes who discovered and made use of a large salt prairie south of the town. The Native Americans used evaporated salt from the [[brine]] stream that flows over the flats as a commodity they traded for other needed goods.  By the mid-nineteenth century, the tribes had been forced out of the area by [[Mirabeau B. Lamar]], second president of the [[Republic of Texas]] and by general anti-Indian sentiment and moved southeast. Only a few years after the Indians left the salt prairie behind, a new group of settlers arrived. A settler named John Jordan and other settlers brought their families and set up a primitive salt works. The community named Jordan\u2019s Saline quickly became the center of Van Zandt County and was, for a while the county seat.\n\n[[File:Fullsizeoutput 86.jpg|thumb|Museum and Coffee Shop in Downtown Grand Saline.]]\nThe salt produced here was used in the process of tanning leather and preserving food stuffs. Following the [[American Civil War]] the [[Texas and Pacific Railroad]] was extended from Marshall to Dallas. A parcel of land was donated to the railroad and a depot was built and the stop was named Grand Saline. The City of Grand Saline was incorporated in 1895 and the community of Jordan\u2019s Saline faded into history as its residents moved north to the bustling new city.\n\n[[File:Fullsizeoutput 7e.jpg|thumb|Historic Grand Saline Main Street Neighborhood.]]\n\nThere were formerly numerous salt companies in Grand Saline, including the Richardson Salt works, which had drilled the first salt well; the Lone Star Salt Company, Kleer Salt Works, the first steam powered salt plant; and the Grand Saline Salt Company which later became the Morton Salt Company. During the late 1920s, the discovery of the nearby [[Van, Texas]] oil field brought companies that provided needed supplies. In the 1930s Grand Saline had twelve petroleum supply companies and five lumber companies. In the Depression years, local sewing rooms made garments for the poor. During [[World War II]], a worker\u2019s strike at Morton Salt led the town to form the Grand Saline Industrial Foundation to attract new business to town. Their efforts produced clothing manufacturers, sulfur processing and meat packing companies.  Grand Saline was also known for its Lone Star Hotel which was, for a brief time, the home of Hollywood starlet [[Louise Fazenda]], the wife of Warner Brothers executive [[Hal Wallis]]. Agriculture, farming, and ranching have long been a major part of the economic life in Grand Saline. Crops have included sweet potatoes and other truck crops. A cotton gin built south of town in 1890 marked the beginning of many years of cotton production. Poultry, livestock, dairy products, lumber and an [[Ice house (building)|Ice House]] all played a role in the formation and history of the town.\n\n==Geography==\n[[File:Fullsizeoutput 7a.jpg|thumb|Downtown Grand Saline]]\n\nGrand Saline is located at {{coord|32|40|40|N|95|42|41|W|type:city}} (32.677662, -95.711521),<ref name=\"GR1\">{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/geo/www/gazetteer/gazette.html|publisher=[[United States Census Bureau]]|accessdate=2011-04-23|date=2011-02-12|title=US Gazetteer files: 2010, 2000, and 1990}}</ref> in the northeastern area of Van Zandt County, at the intersection of [[Texas State Highway 110]] and [[U.S. Route 80]] in western [[East Texas]].

Detailed investigations found that SARS-CoV was transmitted from [[Masked palm civet|civet cats]] to humans, and MERS-CoV from dromedary camels to humans. Several known coronaviruses are circulating in animals that have not yet infected humans. Common signs of infection include respiratory symptoms, [[fever]], [[cough]], shortness of breath, and breathing difficulties. In more severe cases, infection can cause pneumonia, severe acute respiratory syndrome, kidney failure and even death. Standard recommendations to prevent the spread of infection include regular hand washing, covering mouth and nose when coughing and sneezing, thoroughly cooking meat and eggs, and avoiding close contact with anyone showing symptoms of respiratory illness such as coughing and sneezing. The recommended distance from other people is 6 feet, a practice more commonly called social distancing.\n\n==== Severe acute respiratory syndrome ====\n\nIn 2003 the Italian physician [[Carlo Urbani]] (1956\u20132003) was the first to identify severe acute respiratory syndrome ([[SARS]]) as a new and dangerously contagious disease, although he became infected and died. It is caused by a [[coronavirus]] dubbed [[Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus|SARS-CoV]]. Rapid action by national and international health authorities such as the [[World Health Organization]] helped to slow transmission and eventually broke the chain of transmission, which ended the localized epidemics before they could become a pandemic. However, the disease has not been eradicated and could re-emerge.

Detailed investigations found that SARS-CoV was transmitted from [[Masked palm civet|civet cats]] to humans, and MERS-CoV from dromedary camels to humans. Several known coronaviruses are circulating in animals that have not yet infected humans. Common signs of infection include respiratory symptoms, [[fever]], [[cough]], shortness of breath, and breathing difficulties. In more severe cases, infection can cause pneumonia, severe acute respiratory syndrome, kidney failure and even death. Standard recommendations to prevent the spread of infection include regular hand washing, covering mouth and nose when coughing and sneezing, thoroughly cooking meat and eggs, and avoiding close contact with anyone showing symptoms of respiratory illness such as coughing and sneezing. The recommended distance from other people is 6 feet, a practice more commonly called social distancing.\n\n==== Severe acute respiratory syndrome ====\n\nIn 2003 the Italian physician [[Carlo Urbani]] (1956\u20132003) was the first to identify severe acute respiratory syndrome ([[SARS]]) as a new and dangerously contagious disease, although he became infected and died. It is caused by a [[coronavirus]] dubbed [[Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus|SARS-CoV]]. Rapid action by national and international health authorities such as the [[World Health Organization]] helped to slow transmission and eventually broke the chain of transmission, which ended the localized epidemics before they could become a pandemic. However, the disease has not been eradicated and could re-emerge. This warrants monitoring and reporting of suspicious cases of atypical pneumonia.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.who.int/mediacentre/news/releases/2003/pr56/en/|title=WHO &#124; SARS outbreak contained worldwide|website=WHO}}\nbe safe be active</ref>\n\n=== Influenza ===\n\n{{Main|Influenza pandemic}}\n[[File:Barack Obama being briefed on swine flu oubreak 4-29.jpg|thumb|President [[Barack Obama]] is briefed in the Situation Room about the [[2009 flu pandemic]], which killed as many as 17,000 Americans.<ref>{{cite news |title=Swine flu has killed up to 17,000 in U.S.: report |url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-flu-usa/swine-flu-has-killed-up-to-17000-in-u-s-report-idUSN1223579720100212 |agency=Reuters |date=12 February 2010}}</ref>]]\nWild aquatic birds are the natural hosts for a range of [[influenza]] A viruses.

He also was a major benefactor in the tourist town of [[Medora, North Dakota]] and the [[Medora Musical]].\n<ref>{{cite web|url=  http://blog.medora.com/harold-schafer-legend-to-legacy/ |title =  Harold Schafer, Legend to Legacy |website=   Theodore Roosevelt Medora Foundation  \n|access-date=March 1, 2020}}</ref>\n\n==Background==\nSchafe was born on a small farm near [[Stanton, North Dakota]] the second of three children born to Edward and Bertha Schafer. His brother Gordon was born in 1911, his sister Ethelwyn in 1916. Harold spoke only German at home until he went to elementary school.<ref>Brooke, James.

''[[The New York Times]]''. March 2, 1996; accessed December 10, 2012.</ref> \n\nDuring his school years the family moved repeatedly. In 1919, the Schafers moved from the farm near Stanton to another small farm near Hazen, then to Killdeer in 1920 and to Bismarck in 1922. Harold next spent a considerable period of time with his mother's family near [[Rosebud, South Dakota]]. In 1924, when  Schafer was 12 years old, his father left the family and Harold moved back to Bismarck to live with his mother. He and his mother subsequently moved to Jamestown, then to Glen Ullin and finally back to Bismarck in 1927.  Schafer graduated from Bismarck High School. \n<ref>{{cite web|url=  https://medora.com/data/upfiles/media/Spring_2012.pdf  |title =   Celebrating Harold Schafer\u2019s 100th Birthday\n|website=   medora.com |access-date=March 1, 2020}}</ref>\n\nDuring this period in his life,  Schafer took his first paid job at the age of eight working in a butcher shop in Killdeer. When his family moved to Bismarck he worked as a newspaper boy, did janitorial work and was employed as a gas station attendant. In Jamestown he candled eggs, sold flowers and worked as a department store clerk. In Glen Ullin he worked on a threshing crew, and by the time he was back in Bismarck and graduating from high school,  Schafer did odd jobs at the Dahl clothing store, was an usher at the Capitol Theater, a bellhop at the Patterson Hotel, and an attendant at the Standard Oil Service Station. He also delivered milk, shoveled snow and was offered a job as a salesman at Bergeson's clothing store.<ref>{{cite web|url=   https://www.northdakotacowboy.com/copy-of-theodore-roosevelt|title =Harold Schafer, Legacy Award Inducted 2013|website=North Dakota Cowboy Hall of Fame|access-date=March 1, 2020}}</ref>\n\nIn 1929,  Schafer enrolled at the [[North Dakota State University|North Dakota State Agricultural College]] (now NDSU) in Fargo. He continued to work at multiple jobs and once again his employment included work as a salesman, this time at the Globe Clothing Company. Schafer left college after one year and hit the road as a traveling salesman. By 1931, at the age of 19, he returned to Bismarck where once again he found work at the Dahl Clothing Store.  Schafer was forced to take a job at a clothing store in [[Glasgow, Montana]], almost immediately after his first wedding but, by January 1, 1936, he was back in Bismarck and working for Vantine's Paint and Glass. He switched to Fargo Glass and Paint in November 1936 and then worked for that company as a traveling salesman for several years. <ref>{{cite web|url=   https://www.bismarckcafe.com/blogs/wiki/harold-schafer|title =   Harold Schafer (1912-2001)|website=   bismarckcafe.com   |author= Randy Hoffman  |date= October 28, 2017 |access-date=March 1, 2020}}</ref>\n\n==Gold Seal Company==\nIn 1942,  Schafer started packaging and selling a product he called Gold Seal Floor Wax. He personally typed the labels by hand and taped them onto old cans in his basement and, thus, Gold Seal Company was born. In the spring of 1943, Harold resigned his job at Fargo Glass and Paint to pursue his new dream, only to discover that the few hundred dollars that he had expected to have available for the purpose of starting the company did not materialize. At that point the family had three small children, no job and no money, and his new company had no assets.<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20110919154654/http://www.bismancafe.com/blogs/harold-schafer ''Harold Schafer''] (BismarckPride.com) </ref>\n\nIn 1943, his Gold Seal Company made a profit of $901.02, and  Schafer borrowed money from friends to keep going. The company grew modestly at first but, in 1945 introduced a new product called Glass Wax. Sales increased dramatically and then suddenly boomed when, in 1948, Glass Wax  went national.  The rapid rise of this small North Dakota company,  Schafer's sometimes flamboyant management style, and his incredible enthusiasm for hard work propelled it into the national limelight. The success of Glass Wax was repeated again in the 1950s with Snowy Bleach and in the 1960s with Mr. Bubble. Each of these became the number one selling product in their respective categories, and the Gold Seal Company continued to produce increasing sales and profits until it was sold to [[Air Wick|Airwick Industries]] in 1986.<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20120307005140/http://www.bismarckpride.com/blogs/?page_id=165 ''Gold Seal Company''] (BismarckPride.com) </ref>\n<ref>{{cite web|url=  https://www.mrbubble.com/history/|title = History of Mr. Bubble |website=   mrbubble.com \n|access-date=March 1, 2020}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url= http://blog.medora.com/10-things-you-didnt-know-about-the-gold-seal-company/  \n|title =  10 things you didn\u2019t know about the Gold Seal Company |website=   Theodore Roosevelt Medora Foundation|access-date=March 1, 2020}}</ref>\n\n==Later years==\nAfter selling his Gold Seal interests, Schafer reinvested much of his assets in the [[Theodore Roosevelt Medora Foundation]] to promote and preserve Medora's [[Western United States|Western]] culture.

Other renovations and improvements soon followed and, in 1965, the Medora Division of the Gold Seal Company was opened to the public.  Schafer was enthralled with Medora and its fascinating history, and continued to pour his money and his efforts into this project. Medora eventually developed into the largest recreational area in the state of North Dakota. When the Gold Seal Company was sold in 1986, the family donated the Medora assets to the newly formed Theodore Roosevelt Medora Foundation. <ref>{{cite web|url=  https://medora.com/give/about-the-theodore-roosevelt-medora-foundation/|title =  Theodore Roosevelt Medora Foundation|website=   medora.com|access-date=March 1, 2020}}</ref>\n\nA number of awards were bestowed on Schafer for his philanthropy, but he also became the youngest person ever to win the [[Horatio Alger Association of Distinguished Americans|Horatio Alger award]]<ref>[https://www.governor.nd.gov/media-center/theodore-roosevelt-rough-rider-award/harold-schafer ''Harold L.

His brother Gordon was born in 1911, his sister Ethelwyn in 1916. Harold spoke only German at home until he went to elementary school.<ref>Brooke, James. ''[https://www.nytimes.com/1996/03/02/us/north-dakota-with-german-roots-adopts-spanish-as-second-language.html North Dakota, With German Roots, Adopts Spanish as Second Language]''. ''[[The New York Times]]''. March 2, 1996; accessed December 10, 2012.</ref> \n\nDuring his school years the family moved repeatedly. In 1919, the Schafers moved from the farm near Stanton to another small farm near Hazen, then to Killdeer in 1920 and to Bismarck in 1922. Harold next spent a considerable period of time with his mother's family near [[Rosebud, South Dakota]]. In 1924, when  Schafer was 12 years old, his father left the family and Harold moved back to Bismarck to live with his mother. He and his mother subsequently moved to Jamestown, then to Glen Ullin and finally back to Bismarck in 1927.  Schafer graduated from Bismarck High School. \n<ref>{{cite web|url=  https://medora.com/data/upfiles/media/Spring_2012.pdf  |title =   Celebrating Harold Schafer\u2019s 100th Birthday\n|website=   medora.com |access-date=March 1, 2020}}</ref>\n\nDuring this period in his life,  Schafer took his first paid job at the age of eight working in a butcher shop in Killdeer. When his family moved to Bismarck he worked as a newspaper boy, did janitorial work and was employed as a gas station attendant. In Jamestown he candled eggs, sold flowers and worked as a department store clerk. In Glen Ullin he worked on a threshing crew, and by the time he was back in Bismarck and graduating from high school,  Schafer did odd jobs at the Dahl clothing store, was an usher at the Capitol Theater, a bellhop at the Patterson Hotel, and an attendant at the Standard Oil Service Station. He also delivered milk, shoveled snow and was offered a job as a salesman at Bergeson's clothing store.<ref>{{cite web|url=   https://www.northdakotacowboy.com/copy-of-theodore-roosevelt|title =Harold Schafer, Legacy Award Inducted 2013|website=North Dakota Cowboy Hall of Fame|access-date=March 1, 2020}}</ref>\n\nIn 1929,  Schafer enrolled at the [[North Dakota State University|North Dakota State Agricultural College]] (now NDSU) in Fargo. He continued to work at multiple jobs and once again his employment included work as a salesman, this time at the Globe Clothing Company. Schafer left college after one year and hit the road as a traveling salesman. By 1931, at the age of 19, he returned to Bismarck where once again he found work at the Dahl Clothing Store.  Schafer was forced to take a job at a clothing store in [[Glasgow, Montana]], almost immediately after his first wedding but, by January 1, 1936, he was back in Bismarck and working for Vantine's Paint and Glass. He switched to Fargo Glass and Paint in November 1936 and then worked for that company as a traveling salesman for several years. <ref>{{cite web|url=   https://www.bismarckcafe.com/blogs/wiki/harold-schafer|title =   Harold Schafer (1912-2001)|website=   bismarckcafe.com   |author= Randy Hoffman  |date= October 28, 2017 |access-date=March 1, 2020}}</ref>\n\n==Gold Seal Company==\nIn 1942,  Schafer started packaging and selling a product he called Gold Seal Floor Wax. He personally typed the labels by hand and taped them onto old cans in his basement and, thus, Gold Seal Company was born. In the spring of 1943, Harold resigned his job at Fargo Glass and Paint to pursue his new dream, only to discover that the few hundred dollars that he had expected to have available for the purpose of starting the company did not materialize. At that point the family had three small children, no job and no money, and his new company had no assets.<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20110919154654/http://www.bismancafe.com/blogs/harold-schafer ''Harold Schafer''] (BismarckPride.com) </ref>\n\nIn 1943, his Gold Seal Company made a profit of $901.02, and  Schafer borrowed money from friends to keep going. The company grew modestly at first but, in 1945 introduced a new product called Glass Wax. Sales increased dramatically and then suddenly boomed when, in 1948, Glass Wax  went national.  The rapid rise of this small North Dakota company,  Schafer's sometimes flamboyant management style, and his incredible enthusiasm for hard work propelled it into the national limelight. The success of Glass Wax was repeated again in the 1950s with Snowy Bleach and in the 1960s with Mr. Bubble. Each of these became the number one selling product in their respective categories, and the Gold Seal Company continued to produce increasing sales and profits until it was sold to [[Air Wick|Airwick Industries]] in 1986.<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20120307005140/http://www.bismarckpride.com/blogs/?page_id=165 ''Gold Seal Company''] (BismarckPride.com) </ref>\n<ref>{{cite web|url=  https://www.mrbubble.com/history/|title = History of Mr. Bubble |website=   mrbubble.com \n|access-date=March 1, 2020}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url= http://blog.medora.com/10-things-you-didnt-know-about-the-gold-seal-company/  \n|title =  10 things you didn\u2019t know about the Gold Seal Company |website=   Theodore Roosevelt Medora Foundation|access-date=March 1, 2020}}</ref>\n\n==Later years==\nAfter selling his Gold Seal interests, Schafer reinvested much of his assets in the [[Theodore Roosevelt Medora Foundation]] to promote and preserve Medora's [[Western United States|Western]] culture. Schafer was honored for this benefaction with the [[Roughrider Award]], North Dakota's highest civilian honor.<ref>[http://www.medora.com/about/?About-T.-R.-Medora-Foundation ''Theodore Roosevelt Medora Foundation''] ( Historic Medora, North Dakota)</ref><ref>[http://www.governor.state.nd.us/awards/rr-gallery/schafer.html ''Harold Schafer, entrepreneur July 4, 1975''] (Theodore Roosevelt Rough Rider Award) </ref><ref>{{cite web|url=   https://www.grandforksherald.com/news/4070899-legend-badlands-after-30-years-foundation-continues-harold-schafers-dream-making-medora|title =  Legend of the Badlands: After 30 years, foundation continues Harold Schafer's dream of making Medora a family tradition |website=   Grand Forks Herald|access-date=March 1, 2020}}</ref>\n\nHe purchased the Rough Riders Hotel and the Ferris Store in 1962 and began renovating them in 1963. Other renovations and improvements soon followed and, in 1965, the Medora Division of the Gold Seal Company was opened to the public.  Schafer was enthralled with Medora and its fascinating history, and continued to pour his money and his efforts into this project. Medora eventually developed into the largest recreational area in the state of North Dakota. When the Gold Seal Company was sold in 1986, the family donated the Medora assets to the newly formed Theodore Roosevelt Medora Foundation. <ref>{{cite web|url=  https://medora.com/give/about-the-theodore-roosevelt-medora-foundation/|title =  Theodore Roosevelt Medora Foundation|website=   medora.com|access-date=March 1, 2020}}</ref>\n\nA number of awards were bestowed on Schafer for his philanthropy, but he also became the youngest person ever to win the [[Horatio Alger Association of Distinguished Americans|Horatio Alger award]]<ref>[https://www.governor.nd.gov/media-center/theodore-roosevelt-rough-rider-award/harold-schafer ''Harold L.

Security guards do this by maintaining a high-visibility presence to deter illegal and inappropriate actions, looking (either directly, through patrols, or indirectly, by monitoring [[alarm|alarm systems]] or [[closed-circuit television|video surveillance cameras]]) for signs of crime or other hazards (such as a fire), taking action to minimize damage (such as warning and escorting trespassers off property), and reporting any incidents to their clients and [[emergency services]] (such as the police or paramedics), as appropriate.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.facebook.com/SOBrotherhood/|title=Security Officer's Brotherhood (Facebook group)|accessdate=12 December 2015}}</ref>\n\nSecurity officers are generally [[uniform]]ed to represent their lawful [[authority]] to protect private property. Security guards are generally governed by legal regulations, which set out the requirements for eligibility (e.g., a criminal record check) and the permitted authorities of a security guard in a given jurisdiction. The authorities permitted to security guards vary by country and subnational jurisdiction. Security officers are hired by a range of organizations, including businesses, government departments and agencies and not-for-profit organizations (e.g., churches and charitable organizations).\n\nUntil the 1980s, the term '''[[watchman (law enforcement)|watchman]]''' was more commonly applied to this function, a usage dating back to at least the [[Middle Ages]] in [[Europe]] where there was no form of [[law enforcement]] (other than it being a private matter). This term was carried over to North America where it was interchangeable with '''night-watchman''' (e.g., security guard) until both terms were replaced with the modern security-based titles. Security officers are sometimes regarded as fulfilling a [[private policing]] function.\n\n== Functions and duties ==\n[[File:Bgpsp.jpeg|thumbnail|right|Bodyguard protects Members of Parliament during public visits by visitors in the [[Chamber of Deputies of the Czech Republic]] in 2015.]]\n[[File: Armed guard escort on a merchant ship.jpg|thumb|right|Private guard escort on a merchant ship providing security services against pirates.]]\nMany security firms and proprietary security departments practice the \"detect, deter, observe and report\" method. Security officers are not required to make arrests, but have the authority to make a [[citizens arrest|citizen's arrest]], or otherwise act as an agent of law enforcement, for example, at the request of a [[police officer]] or [[sheriff]].\n\nA private security officer's responsibility is protecting their client from a variety of hazards (usually in the form of criminal acts). Security personnel enforce company rules and can act to protect lives and property, and they sometimes have a contractual obligation to provide these actions. In addition to basic deterrence, security officers are often trained to perform specialized tasks such as arrest and control (including handcuffing and restraints), operate emergency equipment, perform [[first aid]], [[CPR]], take accurate notes, write detailed reports, and perform other tasks as required by the client they are serving. All security officers are also required to go through additional training mandated by the state for the carrying of weapons such as batons, firearms, and pepper spray (e.g. the Bureau of Security and Investigative Services in California has requirements that a license for ''each'' item listed must be carried while on duty).<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.bsis.ca.gov/forms_pubs/poa.pdf |title=Power to Arrest Training Manual - California Bureau of Security and Investigative Services |date= |accessdate=2010-03-25}}</ref> Some officers are required to complete police certification for special duties.\nThe number of jobs is expected to grow in the U.S., with 175,000 new security jobs expected before 2016.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.bls.gov/oco/ocos159.htm#outlook |title=Bureau of Labor Statistics Occupational Outlook Handbook, 2008-09 Edition |publisher=Bls.gov |date=2009-12-17 |accessdate=2010-03-25 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100330055228/http://www.bls.gov/oco/ocos159.htm#outlook |archivedate=2010-03-30 }}</ref> In recent years, due to elevated threats of terrorism, most security officers are required to have bomb-threat training and/or emergency crisis training, especially those located in [[soft target]] areas such as shopping malls, schools, and any other area where the general public congregate. One major economic justification for security personnel is that [[insurance]] companies (particularly fire insurance carriers) will give substantial rate discounts to sites which have a 24-hour presence. For a high risk or high-value property, the discount can often exceed the money being spent on its security program.  Discounts are offered because having security on site increases the odds that any fire will be noticed and reported to the local fire department before a total loss occurs.  Also, the presence of security officers (particularly in combination with effective security procedures) tends to diminish \"[[shrinkage (accounting)|shrinkage]]\", theft, employee misconduct, and safety rule violations, property damage, or even [[sabotage]]. Many [[casino]]s hire security officers to protect money when transferring it from the casino to the casino's bank.\n\nSecurity personnel may also perform [[access control]] at building entrances and vehicle gates; meaning, they ensure that employees and visitors display proper passes or identification before entering the facility. Security officers are called upon to respond to potential hazards (such as broken lights or doors, disturbances, lost persons, minor injuries, etc.) and to assist in serious emergencies (medicals, fires, crime, etc.) by securing the scene to prevent further loss or damage, summoning emergency responders to the incident, helping to redirect foot traffic to safe locations, and by documenting what happened on an incident report to give their client an idea of how to prevent similar situations from occurring. Armed security officers are frequently contracted to respond as law enforcement until a given situation at a client location is under control and/or public authorities arrive on the scene.\n\nPatrolling is usually a large part of a security officer's duties, as most incidents are prevented by being looked for instead of waiting for them to occur. Often these patrols are logged by use of a [[guard tour patrol system]], which require regular patrols. Until recently the most commonly used form used to be [[watch clock|mechanical clock]] systems that required a key for manual punching of a number to a strip of paper inside with the time pre-printed on it.  But recently, electronic systems have risen in popularity due to their lightweight, ease of use, and downloadable logging capabilities.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.morsewatchman.com/products/powercheck.shtml |title=Morse Watchmans &#124; Products &#124; PowerCheck |publisher=Morsewatchman.com |date= |accessdate=2010-03-25}}</ref> Regular patrols are, however, becoming less accepted as an industry standard, as it provides predictability for the would-be criminal, as well as monotony for the security officer on duty. Random patrols are easily programmed into electronic systems, allowing greater freedom of movement and unpredictability. [[Global positioning systems]] are beginning to be used because they are a more effective means of tracking officers' movements and behavior.\n\n==Personnel==\nAlthough security officers differ from police officers, military personnel, federal agents/officers, and the like, Australia and the United States have a growing proportion of security personnel that has former police or military experience, including senior management personnel. On the other hand, some security officers, young people, in particular, use the job as a practical experience to use in applying to law enforcement agencies.\n\n===Types of personnel and companies===\n[[File:Security units in Indonesia.jpg|thumb|[[shopping mall|Mall]] [[parking lot]] security guards (''Satpam'') in [[Jakarta]], [[Indonesia]].]]\n[[File:Security guard in China 01.jpg|thumb|A security officer protecting the entrance to an apartment building, and managing the parking of cars in [[Haikou]], [[Hainan]] Province, [[People's Republic of China|China]].]]\n\nSecurity personnel are classified as one of the following:\n\n* \"In-house\" or \"proprietary\" (i.e. employed by the same company or organization they protect, such as a [[shopping mall|mall]], [[amusement park|theme park]], or [[casino]]); formerly often called works police or [[security police]] in the [[United Kingdom]].\n* \"Security supervisor\", meets with clients and employees as necessary to ensure client and employee satisfaction.\n* \"Scheduler\", Security Officer assignment and strategic scheduling resulting in client satisfaction, [[employee retention]] and cost maintained within District financial plans.<ref name=scheduler>{{cite web|last=Kator|first=Zabi|title=Scheduler|url=http://www.guardnow.com/how-to-start-a-security-guard-company/intro-to-how-to-start-a-security-guard-company/how-to-structure-a-security-company/|work=guardNOW|publisher=guardNOW Security Services |accessdate=1 May 2013}}</ref>\n* \"Human Resources Manager\", effective delivery of human resources services such as employment, employee/labor relations, compensation, benefits administration, training and development, workers\u2019 compensation, and audit compliance.

The former, often called \"guards\", are taught the mantra \"observe and report\", are minimally trained, and not expected to deal with the public or confront criminals.\n\nThe latter are often highly trained, sometimes armed depending on contracts agreed upon with clientele, and are more likely to interact with the general public and to confront the criminal element. These employees tend to take pride in the title \"Security Officer\" or \"[[Certified Protection Officer|Protection Officer]]\" and disdain the label of \"guard\". Security jobs vary in pay and duties. There is sometimes little relationship between duties performed and compensation, for example some mall \"security officers\" who are exposed to serious risks earn less per hour than \"industrial security guards\" who have less training and responsibility.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.securityguardservicesguide.com/wages.php |title=security guard services guide |accessdate=2007-12-06 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071221104846/http://www.securityguardservicesguide.com/wages.php |archive-date=2007-12-21 |url-status=dead }}</ref> However, there are now more positions in the security role that separate not just the titles, but the job itself. The roles have progressed and so have the areas for which security people are needed. The term \"agent\" can be confusing in the security industry because it can describe a civil legal relationship between an employee and their employer or contractor (\"agent of the owner\" in California PC 602), and also can describe a person in government service (\"[[Special Agent]] Jones of the [[Federal Bureau of Investigation]]\".) The title \"agent\" can be confused with bail enforcement agents, also known as \"bounty hunters\", who are sometimes regulated by the same agencies which regulate private security.  The term \"agent\" is also used in other industries, such as banking agents, loan agents and real estate agents. Security agents are often employed in loss prevention and personal or executive protection (bodyguards) roles. They typically work in plainclothes (without a uniform), and are usually highly trained to act lawfully in direct defense of life or property.\n\nSecurity officers are private citizens, and therefore are bound by the same laws and regulations as the citizenry they are contracted to serve, and therefore are not allowed to represent themselves as law enforcement under penalty of law.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.ci.ceres.ca.us/weeklyarticle/20070801.html |title=City of Ceres, California, Chief de Werk's Weekly Article |publisher=Ci.ceres.ca.us |date=2007-08-01 |accessdate=2010-03-25 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090213200406/http://www.ci.ceres.ca.us/weeklyarticle/20070801.html |archive-date=2009-02-13 |url-status=dead }}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.oregon.gov/OSP/PATROL/docs/Law_Enforcement_Impersonators.pdf |title=Archived copy |access-date=2007-10-11 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080228181823/http://www.oregon.gov/OSP/PATROL/docs/Law_Enforcement_Impersonators.pdf |archive-date=2008-02-28 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\n== Training ==\n[[File:Yogyakarta Indonesia Prambanan-temple-complex-21.jpg|thumb|Security guards in [[Prambanan]] Temple, [[Central Java]], [[Indonesia]]]]\n[[File:Kenyan security officer.jpg|thumb|right|A [[Kenya]]n private security guard.]]\nJust as with the police profession, training requirements for the private security industry have evolved over time. For many years security officers were poorly chosen and poorly trained (if at all), partly because security companies who contracted with clients in private industry were paid very little for their security services. For the most part, contracts were awarded to security officer companies through a competition process and the final selection was often made based on cost rather than the experience or professionalism of the security guard company. That changed drastically on September 11, 2001 when radical terrorists attacked the United States.{{cn|date=October 2019}} The event moved corporate threat concerns to the top of the priority list for most security guard contracts started being awarded based on professionalism.{{cn|date=October 2019}} More money was invested in security so more money became available for training of security guards.{{cn|date=October 2019}} The term 'security professional' began to surface and large private security companies like Blackwater, USA began offering training services for the private security industry that approached the level of training provided by the military.{{cn|date=October 2019}} Security companies began paying enough to attract people with significant backgrounds in law enforcement and the military, often in special operations.{{citation needed|date=January 2014}}\n\n=== Australia ===\nAny person who conducts a business or is employed in a security-related field within Australia is required to be licensed. Each of the six states and two territories of Australia have separate legislation that covers all security activities. Licensing management in each state/territory is varied and is carried out by either Police, Attorney General's Department, Justice Department or the Department of Consumer Affairs.\n* New South Wales\u2014(Police) Security Industry Act 1997 & Security Industry Regulation 2016\n* Victoria\u2014(Police) Private Security Act 2004\n* Queensland\u2014(Justice & Attorney-General) Security Providers Act 1993\n* South Australia\u2014(Consumer & Business Affairs) Security and Investigation Agents Act 1995\n* Western Australia\u2014(Police) Security & Related Activities (Control) Act 1996 & Security & Related Activities (Control) Regulations 1997\n* Tasmania\u2014(Police) *Security and Investigation Agents Act 2002\n* Northern Territory\u2014(Justice) Private Security Act & Private Security (Security Officer/Crowd Controller/Security Firms/Miscellaneous Matters) Regulations;\n* Australian Capital Territory\u2014(Regulatory Services) Security Industry Act 2003 & Security Industry Regulation 2003\nAll of this legislation was intended to enhance the integrity of the private security industry.\n\nAll persons licensed to perform security activities are required to undertake a course of professional development in associated streams that are recognised nationally. This has not always been the case and the introduction of this requirement is expected to regulate the educational standards and knowledge base so that the particular job can be competently performed. Strict requirements are laid down as to the type of uniform and badge used by security companies. Uniforms or badges that may be confused with a police officer are prohibited. Also, the use of the titles 'Security Police' or 'Private Detective' are unacceptable. While the term security guard is used by companies, government bodies and individuals, the term security officer is deemed more suitable. Bouncers use the title Crowd Controllers, and Store Detectives use the title Loss Prevention or Asset Protection Officers. Security Officers may carry firearms, handcuffs or batons where their role requires them to do so and then only when working and have the appropriate sub-class accreditation to their license.\n\n==== Notable security companies in Australia ====\n\n* MSS Security ([[Security and Intelligence Services (India)|SIS Group]]) <ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.ibisworld.com.au/australian-company-research-reports/public-administration-safety/sis-australia-holdings-pty-ltd-company.html|title=SIS Australia Holdings Pty Ltd}}</ref>\n* SNP Security ([[Certis Group]])\n* [[Wilson Security]]\n* [[Securitas AG|Securitas]]\n* [[Prosegur|Prosegur]]\n* [[Chubb Security]] ([[United Technologies|UTC]])\n* [[ISS A/S|ISS Security]]\n* [[Linfox|Armaguard (Linfox Proprietary Limited)]]\n\n==== Private security trends in Australia ====\n[[File:Weslo Security (9262310704).jpg|thumb|Security guards at an [[Australian rules football]] game.]]\nA 2009 review of trends in private security in Australia, conducted by Tim Prenzler, Karen Earle and Rick Sarre, published by the Australian Institute of Criminology, sought to examine the size and scope of the private security industry in Australia to help inform efforts to develop national consistent standards and licensing regimes.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite web|url=https://aic.gov.au/publications/tandi/tandi374|title=Private security in Australia: trends and key characteristics|last=Tim Prenzler|first=Karen Earle|date=2017-11-03|website=Australian Institute of Criminology|language=en|access-date=2019-06-29}}</ref>\n\nThe review found the industry had a similar gender profile to police (24% female, 76% male), however security had a wider, and older age profile - 35% of security officers were 45 to 64 years old, while 44% of police were concentrated between 30 and 39 years. The review noted that as of 2009, private security outnumbered police two to one; it expected that this rate would continue to slow as security technology become more readily-accessible, especially CCTV camera systems, which are often seen as being more cost-effective than guarding/mobile patrol service.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nThe review referenced a 2007 report from IBISworld (2007:24) that indicated four out of five of the largest private security companies in Australia were foreign-owned, accounting for 44.5% of the market share at the time.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nA 2018 report authored by Anthony Bergin, Donald Williams, and Christopher Dixon and published by the [[Australian Strategic Policy Institute]], focused on the current role of private security in countering hostile threats. An evolving understanding of threats has resulted in private security playing a greater part in responding to critical incidents, such as terrorist attacks.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.asial.com.au/documents/item/1645|title=Safety in Numbers - Australia's Private Security Guard Force and Counter-terrorism}}</ref>\n\nThe report provided a low end estimate of the total number of licensed security personnel across Australia as 120,000 (54,753 employed full-time, up from 52,768 in 2006). It said the security industry is nationally characterized as high-volume and high-turnover, given the conflict between a highly prescriptive selection process by employers and regulators who seek to ensure only fit and proper people are licensed. As such, approximately 47% of the industry consists of casual security officers.\n\nIn 2018, referencing data provided by ASIAL, the report states that the private security industry has an annual turnover of AUD8 billion - split evenly between manpower and the electronics sector. Despite various companies being amalgamated or split up, there continues to be a high rate of foreign-ownership of major security providers; the industry overall however remains split between a small number of national companies and a large number of small, specialized businesses.\n\nTechnological advancements in regards to drones, facial recognition, and robotics are expected to continue to augment the private security landscape in Australia.\n\n=== Canada ===\n{{see also|Gun politics in Canada#Laws and regulation}}\n[[File:Montreal Security 2009 067.jpg|thumb|Security vehicle and officer in [[Montreal]], [[Quebec]].]]\n\nIn [[Canada]], private security falls under the jurisdiction of Canada's ten provinces and three territories.

Most provinces in Canada regulate the use of handcuffs and weapons (such as firearms and batons) by contract security companies and their employees, either banning such use completely or permitting it only under certain circumstances.

For example, section 17 of the Firearms Act makes it an offense for any person, including a security officer, to possess prohibited or restricted firearms (i.e. handguns) anywhere outside of his or her home. There are two exceptions to this prohibition found in sections 18 and 19 of the Act. Section 18 deals with transportation of firearms while Section 19 deals with allowing persons to carry such firearms on their persons to protect their lives or the lives of other persons, or for the performance of their occupation (Armour Car Guards, Licensed Trappers), provided an Authorization to Carry (ATC) is first obtained.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.securityalberta.com/employment |title=Licences and Forms |accessdate=2012-09-03 |author=Government of Alberta, Canada. |work=Ministry of Community Safety and Correctional Services Alberta |publisher=Government of Canada }}</ref>\n\n====British Columbia====\nPrivate security in the province of British Columbia is governed by two pieces of legislation: the Security Services Act<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.security-guard.ca/security-guard-british-columbia/security-services-act-government-of-canada-british-columbia/ |title=Security Services Act |publisher= Security Guards in Canada}}</ref> and the ''Security Services Regulation''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bclaws.ca/Recon/document/freeside/--%20s%20--/security%20services%20act%20%20sbc%202007%20%20c.%2030/05_regulations/10_207_2008.xml |title=Security Services Regulation |accessdate=2009-03-12 |publisher=Government of British Columbia}}</ref> These laws are administered and enforced by the Security Programs and Police Technology Division<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.pssg.gov.bc.ca/securityindustry/ |title=Security Programs and Police Technology Division |accessdate=2009-03-12 |publisher=British Columbia Ministry of Public Safety and Solicitor General |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090320204051/http://www.pssg.gov.bc.ca/securityindustry/ |archive-date=2009-03-20 |url-status=dead }}</ref> of the Ministry of Public Safety and Solicitor General.

Section 11(1)(c) of the Security Services Regulation prohibits security personnel from carrying or using any \"item designed for debilitating or controlling a person or animal\", which the government interprets to include all weapons. As well, section 11 forbids private security from using or carrying restraints, such as handcuffs, unless authorized by the government. However, as in other parts of Canada, armoured car officers are permitted to carry firearms. In the past, only personnel that worked for contract security, that is, security companies, were regulated in British Columbia. However, as of September 1, 2009, in-house security officers and private investigators came under the jurisdiction of the Security Services Act and Security Services Regulation. Bodyguards and bouncers, effective November 1, 2009, are also subject to these regulations.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.pssg.gov.bc.ca/securityindustry/news/index.htm |title=News and Updates |publisher=British Columbia Ministry of Public Safety and Solicitor General |accessdate=2009-06-29}}</ref>\n\n=== Europe ===\n[[File:Stockholm Pride 2015 Parade by Jonatan Svensson Glad 132.JPG|thumb|left|Security officer at 2015 [[Stockholm Pride]] Parade.]]\nArmed private security officers are much rarer in [[Europe]], and illegal in many countries, such as the [[United Kingdom]] and the [[Netherlands]]. In developing countries (with host country permission), an armed security force composed mostly of ex-military personnel is often used to protect corporate assets, particularly in [[war-torn]] regions.\n\nAs a requirement of the Private Security Industry Act 2001, the UK now requires all contract security officers to have a valid [[Security Industry Authority]] license.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.the-sia.org.uk/home/about_sia/legislation/psia.htm |title=SIA website |publisher=The-sia.org.uk |date=2009-11-26 |accessdate=2010-03-25}}</ref> The licence must be displayed when on duty, although a dispensation may be granted for store detectives, bodyguards and others who need to operate without being identified as a security guard. This dispensation is not available to Vehicle Immobilisers. Licenses are valid for three years and require the holders to undergo formal training, and are also to pass mandatory Criminal Records Bureau checks. Licences for Vehicle Immobilisers are valid for one year. Armed guarding and guarding with a weapon are illegal.\n\nIn [[Finland]], all contract security officers are required to have a valid license granted by police. Temporary license is valid for four months and normal license for five years. License requires a minimum 40-hour course for temporary license and 80 hours more for a normal license. Additionally a narrow security vetting is required. The 40-hour course does not allow the guard to carry any kind of special equipment such as a baton or handcuffs. Guards have to complete the 80-hour course to carry these. Separate training and license is required for the security guard to carry [[pepper spray]], extendable baton or a firearm. Rehearse of weapons usage is mandatory every year and is regulated by the Ministry of The Interior, to ensure the safe handling of pepper spray and such. Firearms can only be carried by [[bodyguard]]s and [[cash-in-transit]] guards or when guarding a person or object that is significant in terms of public interest.<ref>{{cite web|title=Private Security Services Act|url=http://finlex.fi/en/laki/kaannokset/2002/en20020282.pdf|accessdate=7 September 2014}}</ref> In Finland, a security guard has the right to detain a person \"red-handed\", or seen committing a crime and the right to search the detained individual for harmful items and weapons. An individual who has been forcefully detained can only be released by the police.

To become a security guard in the Netherlands, a person must complete the basic training level 2 [[Beveiliger2]]. To complete the training a trainee must undergo a three-month internship with a private security company that is licensed by the [[svpb]], the board that controls security exams. A trainee guard must pass for his diploma within one year. If the trainee does not pass he is not allowed to work anymore until he completes his training with a positive result. After a positive result a new ID can be issued and is valid for three years, after which the officer must undergo a background check by the local police again. Security officers in the Netherlands are not allowed to carry any kind of weapon or handcuffs. Every uniformed security guard in the Netherlands must have the V symbol on his or her uniform to advise the public they are dealing with a private guard; this rule is mandated by the Ministry of Justice. Security uniforms may not look like similar to police uniforms, and may not contain any kind of rank designation. The colors yellow and gold are not allowed to be used because the Dutch police uses gold accents in their uniforms; also, wearing a uniform cap is not allowed. Every new uniform design or addition must be approved by the Ministry of Justice before use. A patrol vehicle may not look like a police striped vehicle. The only private security officers who are allowed to carry firearms are those who work for the military or Dutch National bank ([[De Nederlandsche Bank]]); this is where the national gold reserve can be found.\n\n==== Norway ====\n[[File:VaktServiceMobil1.jpg|thumb|Security officer with vehicle in Norway.]]\nIn [[Norway]] security officers are called \"Vektere\". There are two different types of vektere{{mdash}}the normal uniformed or civil-clothing officers who watch over private and semi-public properties, and government-hired vektere who work in public places, such as the Parliament. The law provides more enforcement powers to security officers in the Parliament than to private security officers. Security officers must undergo five weeks of training and internship. It is also possible to choose Security as a high school major, which requires two years of school and two years of trainee positions at private companies, resulting in a certificate from the government. This certificate makes it easier to get a job, with slightly higher pay. It also makes it easier to get a job elsewhere in the security industry. The certificate can also be obtained by private security officers who have had a minimum of 5 years working experience. No security officer may carry pepper spray, batons or any other kind of weapon. However, handcuffs may be used. Norges Bank (Bank of Norway, federal reserves) had armed government guards until late 2013, when they were disarmed by the minister of finance. Security officers serving on ships sailing in areas of high piracy risk may be equipped with firearms. Uniforms should not resemble police worn attire, but some uniforms do. The uniform must have the text 'VEKTER' or 'SIKKERHET' above the left shirt pocket.\n\nA security officer, or any other person, may detain or arrest anyone that violates any law, as long as the violation carries a punishment of minimum six (6) months imprisonment and a fine. The detainee must be released or handed over to the authorities within 4 hours of the arrest. Security officers assigned to public transportation, such as trains, subways, trams and buses, also have some powers under the Transportloven (transportation law). Security officers may issue fixed penalty tickets for violation of parking regulations in designated areas and for passengers on public transportation without a valid pass. A security officer may only search (frisk) a person to prevent the use of or confiscate any type of weapon or anything that can be used as a weapon. In 2006, some security officers (Vakt Service/Nokas) were given extended training and limited police authority to transport prisoners between police holding cells, jails and courts, etc. Due to an outcry from the police union, this program was scrapped after a few months.\n\nIn addition to normal \"vektere\" there also is a special branch for \"Ordensvakter\" who normally work as [[bouncer (doorman)|bouncers]] or security at concerts and similar types of events. Ordensvakter have to undergo an extra week of training to learn techniques on how to handle drunk people and people on various drugs. They also learn about the alcohol laws of [[Norway]] (which are rather strict). The police in the local police district must approve each Ordensvakt. These special regulations arose after events in the 1990s when bouncers had a bad reputation, especially in [[Oslo]], for being too brutal and rough with people. At that time, the police had no control over who worked as bouncers. After the government implemented training and mandatory police-issued ID cards for bouncers the problems have been reduced. The police of Oslo report that Ordensvakter are now helping the police identify crimes that otherwise would not be reported. In 2013, due to a high number of rapes and violent robberies, the city of Oslo (Oslo Kommune) hired a private security company (Metro Garda) to patrol the downtown immigrant areas. This patrol had a positive effect, and the city has, in addition to Metro Garda officers, now hired their own officers called Bymilj\u00f8etaten (City environment dep). The municipalities in Norway are not allowed to form their own \"police\". The only police force in Norway is the federal police (politi).\n\nIn 2007, several officers from the [[Securitas AB]] company were arrested for brutality against a robber they apprehended on the main street of Oslo. The crime was captured with a mobile camera by pedestrians and created a public outcry, with many objecting to the way the security guards took the law into their own hands. Later, it came to light that the thief first attacked the security guards when they approached him, so the brutality charges were dropped.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dagbladet.no/nyheter/2007/12/14/521246.html |title=F\u00e5r ingen konsekvenser for vekterne |publisher=dagbladet.no |date= |accessdate=2007-12-14}}</ref> As a result of this episode, the police said that they would be more careful when conducting criminal background checks for security guards. Before 2007 security guards were checked when they applied for a job, but not while they were working. Security companies were also criticized for not checking criminal records sufficiently, in some cases not at all. Now guards working in private security must be checked annually. The police have the authority to withdraw a company's licence if the company does not submit lists of employees to the police. The police in Norway were widely criticized for not checking guards properly, and even when they encounter an issue with a guard, the guard can still work for months before anything is done. The security company [[G4S]], after being criticized by police for hiring criminals, stated that they cannot do anything about the problem, because only the police have the ability to check the guard's criminal records.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ringblad.no/jobb/article4876392.ece|title=Ringerikes Blad - Kriminelle vektere slipper unna|website=www.ringblad.no}}</ref>\n\nIn 2012, Norwegian media reported that off-duty police officers and Home Guard soldiers had contracts of armed employment on civilian ships in the Aden bay, and police leaders were planning sanctions against the use of police officers.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://klassekampen.no/59975/article/item/null/krigar-i-privat-teneste |title=Private sikkerheitsselskap leiger ut heimevernssoldatar og politimenn som v\u00e6pna vakter p\u00e5 norske skip.

The staff who work under security officers' supervision are called\n''Security Guards''.\n\n====Legislation====\nBefore 1 October 1996, private security personnel were regulated by the ''Watchmen Ordinance'' (Chapter 299). However, there were many problems with that system of regulation\u2014for example, there were no restrictions as to whom may establish private security service companies to provide security services to a client. Also, there was no regulation of people whom may perform installation of security systems. Some employers hired \"caretakers\" instead of security guards to avoid their responsibilities under the ordinance (in formal definition, \"caretakers\" are supposed to provide facilities management service, although security service, which provided to residential properties, takes some parts of facilities management service). As a result, the Hong Kong Government enacted a wholly new law, the ''Security and Guarding Services Ordinance'' (Chapter 460), to replace the ''Watchmen Ordinance''.\n\nAccording to the ''Security and Guarding Services Ordinance'':\nNo individual shall do, agree to do, or hold himself/herself out as doing, or as available to do, security work for another person unless he/she does so-\n* Under and in accordance with a permit; or\n* Otherwise than for reward.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.hklii.org/hk/legis/en/ord/460/s10.html |title=Security and Guarding Services Ordinance - Sect 10 Restrictions on doing security work |publisher=Hklii.org |date= |accessdate=2010-03-25}}</ref>\n\n''Security work'' means any of the following activities-\n* Guarding any property;\n* Guarding any person or place for the purpose of preventing or detecting the occurrence of any offence; (Replaced 25 of 2000 s. 2)\n* Installing, maintaining or repairing a security device;\n* Designing for any particular premises or place a system incorporating a security device.\n\n''Security device'' means a device designed or adapted to be\ninstalled in any premises or place, except on or in a vehicle, for the purpose\nof detecting or recording- (Amended 25 of 2000 s. 2)\n* The occurrence of any offence; or\n* The presence of an intruder or of an object that persons are, for reasons of security, not permitted to bring onto the premises or place or any other premises or place.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.hklii.org/hk/legis/en/ord/460/s2.html |title=Security and Guarding Services Ordinance - Sect 2 Interpretation |publisher=Hklii.org |date=1997-06-30 |accessdate=2010-03-25}}</ref>\n\n==Qualification==\nQualification for security guards vary from country to country. Different requirements have to be completed before applying for this job.\n\n===Hong Kong===\n[[File:HK Security001.jpg|thumb|center|501px|<center>A group of Hong Kong security guards in formation before going on duty</center>]]\n\nAny applicant who wishes to apply for a Security Personnel Permit (SPP) must:\n* He/she have been living in Hong Kong for at least 5 years. (This requirement may have been changed)\n* No criminal record.\n* At least 17 years old when submitting his/her application.\n* Have passed a mandatory 16-hour training course and have been granted a certificate of the course.\n* If the applicant is over 65 years old, he/she must submit his/her health examination report.\n\n====Permit====\nSecurity Personnel Permit was separated to four types: A, B, C, and D.\n* Type A permit holder was permitted to work in a \"single-block\" residential building; they are not allowed to carry firearms. No age limit.\n* Type B permit holder was permitted to work in any type of properties, but they also are not allowed carry firearms. The maximum age limit of this permit is 65.\n* Type C permit holder was permitted to work as an armed guard. (Usually, they are members of the cash transport car crew.) The maximum age limit of this permit is 55.\n* Type D permit holder was permitted to design, install, and repair security devices. No maximum age limit.\nThe permit is valid for five years. All holders must renew their permit before it expires, or they will lose their qualification to work, as such, until their permit is renewed.\n\nThe type A and Type B security service are gradually combined with [[property management]] service, though the boundary between these two industries is unclear.\n\n====Power of arrest====\nSecurity Guards in [[Hong Kong]] do not have special powers of arrest above that of the ordinary citizen, i.e. [[citizen's arrest]], also known locally as the \"101 arrest power\". The Section 101 in the Criminal Procedure Ordinance addresses that arrest of an offender by a private citizen is allowed in certain circumstances if the offender is attempting an arrestable offense. Once arrested, the suspect must be delivered to a police office as soon as possible. An arrestable offence is defined as any crime carrying a sentence of more than 12 months imprisonment. No security personnel are allowed to search other person, nor are they allowed to get personal information from other people, with the exception of some specific circumstances.\n\n=== Israel ===\nIn [[Israel]], almost all security guards carry a firearm, primarily to prevent [[terror attack]]s. Security guards are common: they perform entrance checks at shopping malls, transportation terminals, government and other office buildings, and many stores. Many locations with a high number of visitors, such as the [[Jerusalem Central Bus Station]], employ X-ray machines to check passenger's bags; in other places, they are opened and visually inspected. Since 2009, private security guards companies as [[Mikud (company)|Mikud]] have also replaced official security forces at some checkpoints inside and on the border of the [[West Bank]], as well as the crossings to [[Gaza Strip|Gaza]].\n\n=== Malaysia ===\n[[File:IMAGO Security .jpg|thumb|left|Security officers at KK Times Square in [[Kota Kinabalu]].]]\nThe private security industry is regulated by the Ministry of Home Affairs (Kementerian Dalam Negeri). As of 2018, all private security companies in Malaysia must have a minimum of 80% of their employees complete a Certified Security Guard Training Course <ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.unityforce.com.my/unity_force_kdn.pdf|title=Surat Latihan CSG, Certified Security Guard (CSG) Training|publisher=Kementerian Dalam Negeri|accessdate=2014-12-23}}</ref> in order to receive approval to renew their Private Agency License.

Security guards have the same powers of arrest as a private citizen, called a \"private person\" arrest, \"any person\" arrest, or \"[[citizen's arrest]]\". If weapons are carried, additional permits and training are usually required. Armed security personnel are generally employed to protect sensitive sites such as government and military installations, armored money transports, casinos, banks and other financial institutions, and nuclear power plants. However, armed security is quickly becoming a standard for vehicle patrol officers and on many other non-government sites.\n\nIn some states, companies are developing technology to enhance private security. Using behavior analysis, computers can detect threats more quickly with fewer errors in judgement. Using specific algorithms, a computer can now detect aggressive and defensive body language, which triggers an alert to security or proper authorities depending on the event. These systems can also track slips and falls, theft and other events commonly experienced in corporate America.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.amrelitech.com/amrelitech/DesktopDefault.aspx?tabindex=1&tabid=84|title=Amreli Technology Solutions|website=www.amrelitech.com}}</ref> The responsibilities of security guards in the United States are expanding in scope. For example, a trend is the increasing use of private security to support services previously provided by police departments. [[James F. Pastor]] addresses substantive legal and public policy issues which directly or indirectly relate to the provision of security services. These can be demonstrated by the logic of alternative or supplemental service providers. The use of [[private police]] has particular appeal because property or business owners can directly contract for [[public safety]] services, thereby providing welcome relief for municipal budgets. Finally, private police functions can be flexible, depending upon the financial, organizational, political, and circumstances of the client.<ref>{{cite book|title=The Privatization of Police In America: An Analysis and Case Study|last=Pastor|first=James F.|year=2003|isbn=978-0-7864-1574-8|publisher=McFarland|location=Jefferson, NC}}</ref>\n\n'''Arizona''' \u2014 Licensed security companies are required to provide eight hours of pre-assignment training to all persons employed as security guards before the employee acts in the capacity of a security guard.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://law.onecle.com/arizona/professions-and-occupations/32-2632.html |title=Archived copy |access-date=2010-01-21 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110123224009/http://law.onecle.com/arizona/professions-and-occupations/32-2632.html |archive-date=2011-01-23 |url-status=dead }}</ref> There is a state-mandated curriculum that must be taught, and subjects covered must include criminal law and laws of arrest, uniforms and grooming, communications, use of force, general security procedures, crime scene preservation, ethics, and first response.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://licensing.azdps.gov/SGEightHourTrainingSyllabus.PDF|title=Licensing - Arizona Department of Public Safety|website=licensing.azdps.gov}}</ref>\n\n[[File:ADT Bel-Air Patrol Vehicle.jpg|thumb|An ADT Bel-Air Patrol vehicle]]\n'''California''' \u2014 Security Guards are required to obtain a license from the Bureau of Security and Investigative Services (BSIS), of the [[California Department of Consumer Affairs]].

To be certified as an armed security officer one must complete an additional 24 hours of firearms training, 8 hours of training in conducting a lawful arrest, and qualification with the type and caliber of weapon they intend to carry. Firearms endorsements must be renewed annually by completing an in-service and passing a firearms qualification.

Virginia also allows security officers to attend additional 40 hours of training to become certified as Conservators of the Peace (Special Police) for the company employing them. This appointment is performed by a Circuit Court Judge, wherein the officer is actually sworn in and has the powers of a police officer on property they are working, as well as the lawful duty to act upon witnessing any felony and the ability to pursue fleeing felons. Such sworn officers are also permitted the use of sirens and red lights. Those who handle K-9s, work as dispatchers, alarm responders, private investigators, instructors, bounty hunters, armored car couriers and Executive Protection Specialists are other categories of training regulated by DCJS with additional training requirements. All positions require [[Virginia State Police|State Police]] and FBI background checks.\n\n==Security officers and the police==\n{{More citations needed section|date=April 2013}}\nSecurity personnel are not police officers, unless they are [[security police]]. Security personnel derive their powers from state or provincial laws, which allow them a contractual arrangement with clients that give them Agent of the Owner powers. This includes a nearly unlimited power to question with the absence of probable cause requirements that frequently dog public law enforcement officers. In essence, security officers keep private property / persons safe from hazards, whereas police officers protect entire communities by enforcing laws and arresting suspected offenders. Some jurisdictions do commission or deputize security officers and give them limited additional powers, particularly when employed in protecting public property such as mass transit stations. This is a special case that is often unique to a particular jurisdiction or locale. Additionally, security officers may also be called upon to act as an agent of law enforcement if a police officer, sheriff's deputy, etc. is in immediate need of help and has no available backup.\n\nSome security officers do have reserve police powers and are typically employed directly by governmental agencies. Typically, these are sworn law enforcement personnel whose duties primarily involve the security of a government installation, and are also a special case. Other local and state governments occasionally enter into special contracts with security agencies to provide patrol services in public areas. These personnel are sometimes referred to as \"private police officers\". Sometimes, police officers work as security personnel while not on duty. This is usually done for extra income, and work is particularly done in hazardous jobs such as [[bodyguard]] work and [[Bouncer (doorman)|bouncers]] outside nightclubs. Police are called in when a situation warrants a higher degree of authority to act upon reported observations that security does not have the authority to act upon. However, some states allow Licensed Security Officers full arrest powers equal to those of a Sheriff's Deputy.\n\nIn 1976, the [[Law Enforcement Assistance Administration]]'s National Advisory Commission on Criminal Justice Standards and Goals reported:\n\n<blockquote>One massive resource, filled with significant numbers of personnel, armed with a wide array of technology, and directed by professionals who have spent their entire adult lifetimes learning how to prevent and reduce crime, has not been tapped by governments in the fight against criminality. The private security industry, with over one million workers, sophisticated alarm systems and perimeter safeguards, armored trucks, sophisticated mini-computers, and thousands of highly skilled crime prevention experts, offers a potential for coping with crime that can not be equalled by any other remedy or approach.... Underutilized by police, all but ignored by prosecutors and the judiciary, and unknown to corrections officials, the private security professional may be the only person in this society who has the knowledge to effectively prevent crime.<ref>{{Cite journal|author=National Advisory Commission on Criminal Justice Standards and Goals (NAC-CJSG)|year=1976|title=Private Security: Report of the Task Force on Private Security|location=Washington, DC|publisher=U.S. Department of Justice, Law Enforcement Assistance Administration}}</ref></blockquote>\n\nIn New York City, the [[Area Police/Private Security Liaison]] program was organized in 1986 by the NYPD commissioner and four former police chiefs working in the private security industry to promote mutual respect, cross-training, and sharing of crime-related information between public police and private security.\n\n== Trends ==\n\n===Australia===\nPrivate Security personnel initially outnumbered police. From the Australian Bureau of Statistics Report in 2006 there were 52,768 full-time security officers in the security industry compared to 44,898 police officers. But since Security Industry Regulation Act 2007 it has dropped to less than half that.\n\n===United Kingdom===\nThe trend in the UK at the time of writing (March 2008) is one of polarisation. The market in Manned Guarding (the security industry term for the security guards most people are familiar with) is diverging toward two opposite extremes; one typified by a highly trained and well paid security officer; the other with security officers on or about [[minimum wage]] with only the minimum training required by law. Within the \"in-house\" sector, where security personnel are not subject to licensing under the [[Security Industry Authority|Private Security Industry Act 2001]], the same divergence can be seen, with some companies opting for in-house security to maintain control of their standards, while others use it as a route to cheaper, non-regulated, security. In a very few cases, such as the [[Northern Ireland Security Guard Service]], security guards may be [[Police oath|attested]] as [[Special Constable]]s.\n\n===United States===\nEconomist [[Robert B. Reich]], in his 1991 book ''[[The Work of Nations]]'', stated that in the United States, the number of private security guards and officers was comparable to the number of publicly paid police officers. He used this phenomenon as an example of the general withdrawal of the affluent from existing communities where governments provide public services. Instead, the wealthy pay to provide their own premium services, through voluntary, exclusive associations. As taxpayer resistance has limited government budgets, and as the demand for secure homes in [[gated communities]] has grown, these trends have continued in the 1990s and 2000s. In the aftermath of the [[September 11, 2001 attacks]], the trend in the US is one of a quiet transformation of the role of security guards into first responders in case of a [[terrorist attack]] or major disaster. This has resulted in longer guard instruction hours, extra training in terrorism tactics and increased laws governing private security companies in some states.\n\n== History ==\n[[File:Standing Guard.jpg|thumb|Standing Guard]]\n\nThe ''[[vigiles]]'' were soldiers assigned to guard the city of [[Ancient Rome|Rome]], often credited as the origin of both security personnel and police, although their principal duty was as a [[firefighter|fire brigade]]. There have been night watchmen since at least the [[Middle Ages]] in Europe; walled cities of ancient times also had watchmen. A special chair appeared in Europe sometime in the late Middle Ages, called the [[watchman's chair]]; this unupholstered wooden chair had a forward slanting seat to prevent the watchman from dozing off during duty.\n\n== Notable individuals ==\n* In June 1972, [[Frank Wills (security guard)|Frank Wills]], a security guard at the [[Watergate complex|Watergate office complex]] in [[Washington, D.C.]], noticed a piece of tape covering the latch on an entrance to one of the buildings, thereby preventing it from locking. Police, whom Wills subsequently notified, arrested five men in the portion of the building occupied by the [[Democratic National Committee|Democratic National Committee (DNC)]] headquarters. The following investigations and revelations \u2014 entirely enabled by Wills' discoveries and subsequent actions \u2014 ultimately led to the resignation of [[Richard Nixon|President Richard Nixon]] in what is now infamously known as the [[Watergate scandal]], considered by many to be the largest [[political scandal]] in the history of the [[United States]].\n* [[Christoph Meili]], night guard at a [[Switzerland|Swiss]] bank, became a [[whistle blower]] in 1997. He told about the bank destroying records related to funds of [[Holocaust]] victims, whose money the bank was supposed to return to their heirs.\n* In 1999, [[Pierlucio Tinazzi]] rescued 10 victims from the [[Mont Blanc Tunnel#The 1999 fire|Mont Blanc Tunnel Fire]], before dying while trying to rescue an eleventh.\n* In 2001, [[Gary Coleman]], former child actor, was employed as an armed security officer, with permits valid for both Firearm and Baton through the Bureau of Security and Investigative Services of California in the Los Angeles area. While shopping for a bullet-resistant vest for his job, Coleman assaulted a female autograph collector. Coleman said he felt \"threatened by her insistence\" and punched her in the head.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.courttv.com/archive/trials/coleman/020499.html |title=court TV becomes truTV |publisher=Courttv.com |accessdate=2010-03-25 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081219015819/http://www.courttv.com/archive/trials/coleman/020499.html |archivedate=2008-12-19 }}</ref> He was later charged for the assault and ordered to pay her $1,665 for hospital bills. This also ended up getting his guard card and firearms permits revoked, however his baton permit is still valid until the year 2045. It is unknown why the other two permits were revoked but his baton permit remains. He is not allowed to carry the baton while he is not physically working as a security officer. (Firearms and baton permits issued through BSIS are open carry permits, and you are required to be in uniform, and at work, on your way to or from work to carry them otherwise a separate permit must be issued by the county in California that the individual resides to carry said item off duty.)\n* Derrick Brun, an unarmed security officer employed by the Red Lake School District in Minnesota, was praised by President Bush for his heroic role in protecting children during the 2005 [[Red Lake shootings]]: \"Derrick's bravery cost him his life, and all Americans honor him\".<ref>{{cite web|url=https://georgewbush-whitehouse.archives.gov/news/releases/2005/03/20050326.html |title=President's Radio Address |publisher=Georgewbush-whitehouse.archives.gov |date=2005-03-26 |accessdate=2010-03-25}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.usafreedomcorps.gov/about_usafc/update/update.asp?ID=81 |title=Welcome to Serve.gov |publisher=Usafreedomcorps.gov |accessdate=2010-03-25 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090109235011/http://www.usafreedomcorps.gov/about_usafc/update/update.asp?ID=81 |archive-date=2009-01-09 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n* In 2007, [[2007 Colorado YWAM and New Life shootings|Matthew Murray]] fatally shot two and wounded two others at the Youth With A Mission retreat center in Arvada, Colorado.

Jewell later successfully sued several news agencies who reported him as the criminal prior to having the facts.\n\n==Unionization==\n===Canada===\nMany security guards in Canada are unionized. The primary unions which represent security guards in Canada are the [[United Food and Commercial Workers]] (UFCW),<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ufcw.ca/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=59&Itemid=92&lang=en|title=UFCW Canada - Canada's Private Sector Union|website=UFCW Canada - Canada\u2019s Private Sector Union}}</ref> Local 333, and the Canadian branch of the [[United Steelworkers]] (USW). In contrast to the legal restrictions in the United States, Canadian labour relations boards will certify bargaining units of security guards for a [[Canadian Labour Congress]] (CLC)-affiliated union or in the same union with other classifications of employees.\n\n===United States===\nIn June 1947, the [[United States Congress]] passed the [[Taft-Hartley Act]] placing many restrictions on [[labor union]]s. Section 9 (B) (3) of the act prevents the [[National Labor Relations Board]] (NLRB) from certifying for collective bargaining any unit which mixes security employees with non-security employees. This restricts the ability of security employees to join any union that also represents other types of employees. They may be part of an independent, \"security-only\" union, not affiliated with any coalition of other types of labor unions such as the [[American Federation of Labor and Congress of Industrial Organizations]] (AFL-CIO). A union which also represents non-security employees may also represent and bargain on behalf of security employees with the employer's consent. Two of the largest security unions are the '''Security, Police, and Fire Professionals of America'''(SPFPA) and the '''United Government Security Officers of America'''(UGSOA).\n\n====Security, Police, and Fire Professionals of America====\nIn 1948 with the Taft-Hartley restrictions well into effect, the [[Detroit]], [[Michigan]] area security guards of [[United Auto Workers]] (UAW) Amalgamated Local 114 were forced to break away and start a separate \"Plant Guards Organizing Committee\". The NLRB ruled that as an affiliate of the CIO, the committee was indirectly affiliated with production unions and therefore ineligible for certification under the new restrictions. The committee was then forced to completely withdraw from the CIO and start the independent United Plant Guard Workers of America. By the 1990s, this union had evolved to include many other types of security officers and changed its name to the SPFPA.\n\n====United Government Security Officers of America====\nIn 1992, the UGSOA was formed. It specializes in organizing federal, state, and local government security officers, but since May, 2000 has been open to representing other types of security personnel as well.\n\n====Others====\nThe Service Employees International Union (SEIU) has also sought to represent security employees, although its efforts have been complicated by the Taft-Harley Act because the SEIU also represents janitors, trash collectors, and other building service employees.\n\n==See also==\n{{col-start}}\n{{col-break}}\n* [[Access control]]\n* [[Airport security]]\n* [[Armored car (valuables)]]\n* [[Bodyguard]]\n* [[Bounty hunter]]\n* [[Certified Protection Officer]]\n* [[Commissionaire]]\n* [[Hotel detective|Hotel Detective]]\n* [[List of Private Security Companies]]\n* [[Loss prevention]]\n* [[Northern Ireland Security Guard Service]]\n{{col-break}}\n* [[Physical Security]]\n* [[Police officer|Police Officer]]\n* [[Private investigator]]\n* [[Private military company]]\n* [[Private security company]]\n* [[Security]]\n<!-- * [[Security Patrol Software]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.kerkton.com/|title=Security Software Provider - Security Guard Software - Records Management System|first=Kerkton Security Technologies, LLC|last=[www.kerkton.com]|website=Private Security Software - Kerkton Security Technologies}}</ref> -->\n* [[Security police]]\n* [[Store detective|Store Detective]]\n* [[Traffic guard|Traffic Guard]]\n* [[Transportation security officer]]\n* [[Use of force continuum]]\n{{col-end}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|colwidth=30em}}\n[[Security guard|https://sspaustralia.com.au/security-guard-services/]]\n\n==External links==\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20080708210746/http://www.mcscs.jus.gov.on.ca/english/police_serv/PISG/licences.html Ontario Ministry of Community Safety and Correctional Services information page on new private security legislation introduced in August, 2007]\n* [http://www.the-sia.org.uk/home/about_sia/legislation/psia.htm UK private security industry legislation]\n* [http://www.smallarmssurvey.org/fileadmin/docs/H-Research_Notes/SAS-Research-Note-4.pdf Small Arms Survey Research Note: Private Security Companies' Firearms Stockpiles]\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Security Guard}}\n[[Category:Security guards| ]]\n[[Category:Protective service occupations]]\n[[Category:Crime prevention]]\n[[Category:Physical security]]\n[[Category:Public safety|Guard]]\n[[Category:Law enforcement occupations]]\n[[Category:Surveillance]]\n[[Category:Law enforcement]]\n", "text_old": "{{redirect|Rent-a-cop|the 1987 film|Rent-a-Cop}}\n{{redirect|Mall cop|the film|Paul Blart: Mall Cop}}\n{{Infobox Occupation\n| name = Security Guard\n| image = [[File:Private factory guard.jpg|border|250px]]\n| caption = A private security officer at a Chinese factory in February 2004\n| official_names =\n<!------------Details------------------->\n| type = [[Employment]]\n| activity_sector = [[Security]]\n| competencies =\n| formation =\n| employment_field =\n| related_occupation = [[Usher (occupation)|Usher]], [[Bouncer (doorman)|Bouncer]], [[Doorman (profession)|Doorman]], [[Bodyguard]], [[Hall monitor]], [[Armored car (valuables)|Armored Truck Personnel]], [[Retail Loss Prevention|Loss Prevention Officer]]\n| average_salary =\n}}\nA '''security guard''' (also known as a '''security inspector''', '''security officer''', or '''protective agent''') is a person employed by a government or private party to protect the employing party's assets ([[property]], people, equipment, money, etc.) from a variety of hazards (such as waste, damaged property, unsafe worker behavior, criminal activity such as theft, etc.) by enforcing preventative measures. Security guards do this by maintaining a high-visibility presence to deter illegal and inappropriate actions, looking (either directly, through patrols, or indirectly, by monitoring [[alarm|alarm systems]] or [[closed-circuit television|video surveillance cameras]]) for signs of crime or other hazards (such as a fire), taking action to minimize damage (such as warning and escorting trespassers off property), and reporting any incidents to their clients and [[emergency services]] (such as the police or paramedics), as appropriate.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.facebook.com/SOBrotherhood/|title=Security Officer's Brotherhood (Facebook group)|accessdate=12 December 2015}}</ref>\n\nSecurity officers are generally [[uniform]]ed to represent their lawful [[authority]] to protect private property. Security guards are generally governed by legal regulations, which set out the requirements for eligibility (e.g., a criminal record check) and the permitted authorities of a security guard in a given jurisdiction. The authorities permitted to security guards vary by country and subnational jurisdiction. Security officers are hired by a range of organizations, including businesses, government departments and agencies and not-for-profit organizations (e.g., churches and charitable organizations).\n\nUntil the 1980s, the term '''[[watchman (law enforcement)|watchman]]''' was more commonly applied to this function, a usage dating back to at least the [[Middle Ages]] in [[Europe]] where there was no form of [[law enforcement]] (other than it being a private matter). This term was carried over to North America where it was interchangeable with '''night-watchman''' (e.g., security guard) until both terms were replaced with the modern security-based titles. Security officers are sometimes regarded as fulfilling a [[private policing]] function.\n\n== Functions and duties ==\n[[File:Bgpsp.jpeg|thumbnail|right|Bodyguard protects Members of Parliament during public visits by visitors in the [[Chamber of Deputies of the Czech Republic]] in 2015.]]\n[[File: Armed guard escort on a merchant ship.jpg|thumb|right|Private guard escort on a merchant ship providing security services against pirates.]]\nMany security firms and proprietary security departments practice the \"detect, deter, observe and report\" method. Security officers are not required to make arrests, but have the authority to make a [[citizens arrest|citizen's arrest]], or otherwise act as an agent of law enforcement, for example, at the request of a [[police officer]] or [[sheriff]].\n\nA private security officer's responsibility is protecting their client from a variety of hazards (usually in the form of criminal acts). Security personnel enforce company rules and can act to protect lives and property, and they sometimes have a contractual obligation to provide these actions. In addition to basic deterrence, security officers are often trained to perform specialized tasks such as arrest and control (including handcuffing and restraints), operate emergency equipment, perform [[first aid]], [[CPR]], take accurate notes, write detailed reports, and perform other tasks as required by the client they are serving. All security officers are also required to go through additional training mandated by the state for the carrying of weapons such as batons, firearms, and pepper spray (e.g. the Bureau of Security and Investigative Services in California has requirements that a license for ''each'' item listed must be carried while on duty).<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.bsis.ca.gov/forms_pubs/poa.pdf |title=Power to Arrest Training Manual - California Bureau of Security and Investigative Services |date= |accessdate=2010-03-25}}</ref> Some officers are required to complete police certification for special duties.\nThe number of jobs is expected to grow in the U.S., with 175,000 new security jobs expected before 2016.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.bls.gov/oco/ocos159.htm#outlook |title=Bureau of Labor Statistics Occupational Outlook Handbook, 2008-09 Edition |publisher=Bls.gov |date=2009-12-17 |accessdate=2010-03-25 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100330055228/http://www.bls.gov/oco/ocos159.htm#outlook |archivedate=2010-03-30 }}</ref> In recent years, due to elevated threats of terrorism, most security officers are required to have bomb-threat training and/or emergency crisis training, especially those located in [[soft target]] areas such as shopping malls, schools, and any other area where the general public congregate. One major economic justification for security personnel is that [[insurance]] companies (particularly fire insurance carriers) will give substantial rate discounts to sites which have a 24-hour presence. For a high risk or high-value property, the discount can often exceed the money being spent on its security program.  Discounts are offered because having security on site increases the odds that any fire will be noticed and reported to the local fire department before a total loss occurs.  Also, the presence of security officers (particularly in combination with effective security procedures) tends to diminish \"[[shrinkage (accounting)|shrinkage]]\", theft, employee misconduct, and safety rule violations, property damage, or even [[sabotage]]. Many [[casino]]s hire security officers to protect money when transferring it from the casino to the casino's bank.\n\nSecurity personnel may also perform [[access control]] at building entrances and vehicle gates; meaning, they ensure that employees and visitors display proper passes or identification before entering the facility. Security officers are called upon to respond to potential hazards (such as broken lights or doors, disturbances, lost persons, minor injuries, etc.) and to assist in serious emergencies (medicals, fires, crime, etc.) by securing the scene to prevent further loss or damage, summoning emergency responders to the incident, helping to redirect foot traffic to safe locations, and by documenting what happened on an incident report to give their client an idea of how to prevent similar situations from occurring. Armed security officers are frequently contracted to respond as law enforcement until a given situation at a client location is under control and/or public authorities arrive on the scene.\n\nPatrolling is usually a large part of a security officer's duties, as most incidents are prevented by being looked for instead of waiting for them to occur. Often these patrols are logged by use of a [[guard tour patrol system]], which require regular patrols. Until recently the most commonly used form used to be [[watch clock|mechanical clock]] systems that required a key for manual punching of a number to a strip of paper inside with the time pre-printed on it.  But recently, electronic systems have risen in popularity due to their lightweight, ease of use, and downloadable logging capabilities.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.morsewatchman.com/products/powercheck.shtml |title=Morse Watchmans &#124; Products &#124; PowerCheck |publisher=Morsewatchman.com |date= |accessdate=2010-03-25}}</ref> Regular patrols are, however, becoming less accepted as an industry standard, as it provides predictability for the would-be criminal, as well as monotony for the security officer on duty. Random patrols are easily programmed into electronic systems, allowing greater freedom of movement and unpredictability. [[Global positioning systems]] are beginning to be used because they are a more effective means of tracking officers' movements and behavior.\n\n==Personnel==\nAlthough security officers differ from police officers, military personnel, federal agents/officers, and the like, Australia and the United States have a growing proportion of security personnel that has former police or military experience, including senior management personnel. On the other hand, some security officers, young people, in particular, use the job as a practical experience to use in applying to law enforcement agencies.\n\n===Types of personnel and companies===\n[[File:Security units in Indonesia.jpg|thumb|[[shopping mall|Mall]] [[parking lot]] security guards (''Satpam'') in [[Jakarta]], [[Indonesia]].]]\n[[File:Security guard in China 01.jpg|thumb|A security officer protecting the entrance to an apartment building, and managing the parking of cars in [[Haikou]], [[Hainan]] Province, [[People's Republic of China|China]].]]\n\nSecurity personnel are classified as one of the following:\n\n* \"In-house\" or \"proprietary\" (i.e. employed by the same company or organization they protect, such as a [[shopping mall|mall]], [[amusement park|theme park]], or [[casino]]); formerly often called works police or [[security police]] in the [[United Kingdom]].\n* \"Security supervisor\", meets with clients and employees as necessary to ensure client and employee satisfaction.\n* \"Scheduler\", Security Officer assignment and strategic scheduling resulting in client satisfaction, [[employee retention]] and cost maintained within District financial plans.<ref name=scheduler>{{cite web|last=Kator|first=Zabi|title=Scheduler|url=http://www.guardnow.com/how-to-start-a-security-guard-company/intro-to-how-to-start-a-security-guard-company/how-to-structure-a-security-company/|work=guardNOW|publisher=guardNOW Security Services |accessdate=1 May 2013}}</ref>\n* \"Human Resources Manager\", effective delivery of human resources services such as employment, employee/labor relations, compensation, benefits administration, training and development, workers\u2019 compensation, and audit compliance.

The former, often called \"guards\", are taught the mantra \"observe and report\", are minimally trained, and not expected to deal with the public or confront criminals.\n\nThe latter are often highly trained, sometimes armed depending on contracts agreed upon with clientele, and are more likely to interact with the general public and to confront the criminal element. These employees tend to take pride in the title \"Security Officer\" or \"[[Certified Protection Officer|Protection Officer]]\" and disdain the label of \"guard\". Security jobs vary in pay and duties. There is sometimes little relationship between duties performed and compensation, for example some mall \"security officers\" who are exposed to serious risks earn less per hour than \"industrial security guards\" who have less training and responsibility.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.securityguardservicesguide.com/wages.php |title=security guard services guide |accessdate=2007-12-06 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071221104846/http://www.securityguardservicesguide.com/wages.php |archive-date=2007-12-21 |url-status=dead }}</ref> However, there are now more positions in the security role that separate not just the titles, but the job itself. The roles have progressed and so have the areas for which security people are needed. The term \"agent\" can be confusing in the security industry because it can describe a civil legal relationship between an employee and their employer or contractor (\"agent of the owner\" in California PC 602), and also can describe a person in government service (\"[[Special Agent]] Jones of the [[Federal Bureau of Investigation]]\".) The title \"agent\" can be confused with bail enforcement agents, also known as \"bounty hunters\", who are sometimes regulated by the same agencies which regulate private security.  The term \"agent\" is also used in other industries, such as banking agents, loan agents and real estate agents. Security agents are often employed in loss prevention and personal or executive protection (bodyguards) roles. They typically work in plainclothes (without a uniform), and are usually highly trained to act lawfully in direct defense of life or property.\n\nSecurity officers are private citizens, and therefore are bound by the same laws and regulations as the citizenry they are contracted to serve, and therefore are not allowed to represent themselves as law enforcement under penalty of law.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.ci.ceres.ca.us/weeklyarticle/20070801.html |title=City of Ceres, California, Chief de Werk's Weekly Article |publisher=Ci.ceres.ca.us |date=2007-08-01 |accessdate=2010-03-25 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090213200406/http://www.ci.ceres.ca.us/weeklyarticle/20070801.html |archive-date=2009-02-13 |url-status=dead }}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.oregon.gov/OSP/PATROL/docs/Law_Enforcement_Impersonators.pdf |title=Archived copy |access-date=2007-10-11 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080228181823/http://www.oregon.gov/OSP/PATROL/docs/Law_Enforcement_Impersonators.pdf |archive-date=2008-02-28 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\n== Training ==\n[[File:Yogyakarta Indonesia Prambanan-temple-complex-21.jpg|thumb|Security guards in [[Prambanan]] Temple, [[Central Java]], [[Indonesia]]]]\n[[File:Kenyan security officer.jpg|thumb|right|A [[Kenya]]n private security guard.]]\nJust as with the police profession, training requirements for the private security industry have evolved over time. For many years security officers were poorly chosen and poorly trained (if at all), partly because security companies who contracted with clients in private industry were paid very little for their security services. For the most part, contracts were awarded to security officer companies through a competition process and the final selection was often made based on cost rather than the experience or professionalism of the security guard company. That changed drastically on September 11, 2001 when radical terrorists attacked the United States.{{cn|date=October 2019}} The event moved corporate threat concerns to the top of the priority list for most security guard contracts started being awarded based on professionalism.{{cn|date=October 2019}} More money was invested in security so more money became available for training of security guards.{{cn|date=October 2019}} The term 'security professional' began to surface and large private security companies like Blackwater, USA began offering training services for the private security industry that approached the level of training provided by the military.{{cn|date=October 2019}} Security companies began paying enough to attract people with significant backgrounds in law enforcement and the military, often in special operations.{{citation needed|date=January 2014}}\n\n=== Australia ===\nAny person who conducts a business or is employed in a security-related field within Australia is required to be licensed. Each of the six states and two territories of Australia have separate legislation that covers all security activities. Licensing management in each state/territory is varied and is carried out by either Police, Attorney General's Department, Justice Department or the Department of Consumer Affairs.\n* New South Wales\u2014(Police) Security Industry Act 1997 & Security Industry Regulation 2016\n* Victoria\u2014(Police) Private Security Act 2004\n* Queensland\u2014(Justice & Attorney-General) Security Providers Act 1993\n* South Australia\u2014(Consumer & Business Affairs) Security and Investigation Agents Act 1995\n* Western Australia\u2014(Police) Security & Related Activities (Control) Act 1996 & Security & Related Activities (Control) Regulations 1997\n* Tasmania\u2014(Police) *Security and Investigation Agents Act 2002\n* Northern Territory\u2014(Justice) Private Security Act & Private Security (Security Officer/Crowd Controller/Security Firms/Miscellaneous Matters) Regulations;\n* Australian Capital Territory\u2014(Regulatory Services) Security Industry Act 2003 & Security Industry Regulation 2003\nAll of this legislation was intended to enhance the integrity of the private security industry.\n\nAll persons licensed to perform security activities are required to undertake a course of professional development in associated streams that are recognised nationally. This has not always been the case and the introduction of this requirement is expected to regulate the educational standards and knowledge base so that the particular job can be competently performed. Strict requirements are laid down as to the type of uniform and badge used by security companies. Uniforms or badges that may be confused with a police officer are prohibited. Also, the use of the titles 'Security Police' or 'Private Detective' are unacceptable. While the term security guard is used by companies, government bodies and individuals, the term security officer is deemed more suitable. Bouncers use the title Crowd Controllers, and Store Detectives use the title Loss Prevention or Asset Protection Officers. Security Officers may carry firearms, handcuffs or batons where their role requires them to do so and then only when working and have the appropriate sub-class accreditation to their license.\n\n==== Notable security companies in Australia ====\n\n* MSS Security ([[Security and Intelligence Services (India)|SIS Group]]) <ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.ibisworld.com.au/australian-company-research-reports/public-administration-safety/sis-australia-holdings-pty-ltd-company.html|title=SIS Australia Holdings Pty Ltd}}</ref>\n* SNP Security ([[Certis Group]])\n* [[Wilson Security]]\n* [[Securitas AG|Securitas]]\n* [[Prosegur|Prosegur]]\n* [[Chubb Security]] ([[United Technologies|UTC]])\n* [[ISS A/S|ISS Security]]\n* [[Linfox|Armaguard (Linfox Proprietary Limited)]]\n\n==== Private security trends in Australia ====\n[[File:Weslo Security (9262310704).jpg|thumb|Security guards at an [[Australian rules football]] game.]]\nA 2009 review of trends in private security in Australia, conducted by Tim Prenzler, Karen Earle and Rick Sarre, published by the Australian Institute of Criminology, sought to examine the size and scope of the private security industry in Australia to help inform efforts to develop national consistent standards and licensing regimes.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite web|url=https://aic.gov.au/publications/tandi/tandi374|title=Private security in Australia: trends and key characteristics|last=Tim Prenzler|first=Karen Earle|date=2017-11-03|website=Australian Institute of Criminology|language=en|access-date=2019-06-29}}</ref>\n\nThe review found the industry had a similar gender profile to police (24% female, 76% male), however security had a wider, and older age profile - 35% of security officers were 45 to 64 years old, while 44% of police were concentrated between 30 and 39 years. The review noted that as of 2009, private security outnumbered police two to one; it expected that this rate would continue to slow as security technology become more readily-accessible, especially CCTV camera systems, which are often seen as being more cost-effective than guarding/mobile patrol service.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nThe review referenced a 2007 report from IBISworld (2007:24) that indicated four out of five of the largest private security companies in Australia were foreign-owned, accounting for 44.5% of the market share at the time.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nA 2018 report authored by Anthony Bergin, Donald Williams, and Christopher Dixon and published by the [[Australian Strategic Policy Institute]], focused on the current role of private security in countering hostile threats. An evolving understanding of threats has resulted in private security playing a greater part in responding to critical incidents, such as terrorist attacks.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.asial.com.au/documents/item/1645|title=Safety in Numbers - Australia's Private Security Guard Force and Counter-terrorism}}</ref>\n\nThe report provided a low end estimate of the total number of licensed security personnel across Australia as 120,000 (54,753 employed full-time, up from 52,768 in 2006). It said the security industry is nationally characterized as high-volume and high-turnover, given the conflict between a highly prescriptive selection process by employers and regulators who seek to ensure only fit and proper people are licensed. As such, approximately 47% of the industry consists of casual security officers.\n\nIn 2018, referencing data provided by ASIAL, the report states that the private security industry has an annual turnover of AUD8 billion - split evenly between manpower and the electronics sector. Despite various companies being amalgamated or split up, there continues to be a high rate of foreign-ownership of major security providers; the industry overall however remains split between a small number of national companies and a large number of small, specialized businesses.\n\nTechnological advancements in regards to drones, facial recognition, and robotics are expected to continue to augment the private security landscape in Australia.\n\n=== Canada ===\n{{see also|Gun politics in Canada#Laws and regulation}}\n[[File:Montreal Security 2009 067.jpg|thumb|Security vehicle and officer in [[Montreal]], [[Quebec]].]]\n\nIn [[Canada]], private security falls under the jurisdiction of Canada's ten provinces and three territories.

Most provinces in Canada regulate the use of handcuffs and weapons (such as firearms and batons) by contract security companies and their employees, either banning such use completely or permitting it only under certain circumstances. Additionally, in some provinces, some terms, or variations of them, are prohibited either on a uniform or in self-reference.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.e-laws.gov.on.ca/html/statutes/english/elaws_statutes_05p34_e.htm#BK54 |title=Licences and Forms |accessdate=2007-09-03 |author=Government of Ontario, Canada. |work=Ministry of Community Safety and Correctional Services |publisher=Government of Ontario }}</ref>\n\nCanada's federal laws also restrict the ability of security officers to be armed. For example, section 17 of the Firearms Act makes it an offense for any person, including a security officer, to possess prohibited or restricted firearms (i.e. handguns) anywhere outside of his or her home. There are two exceptions to this prohibition found in sections 18 and 19 of the Act. Section 18 deals with transportation of firearms while Section 19 deals with allowing persons to carry such firearms on their persons to protect their lives or the lives of other persons, or for the performance of their occupation (Armour Car Guards, Licensed Trappers), provided an Authorization to Carry (ATC) is first obtained.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.securityalberta.com/employment |title=Licences and Forms |accessdate=2012-09-03 |author=Government of Alberta, Canada. |work=Ministry of Community Safety and Correctional Services Alberta |publisher=Government of Canada }}</ref>\n\n====British Columbia====\nPrivate security in the province of British Columbia is governed by two pieces of legislation: the Security Services Act<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.security-guard.ca/security-guard-british-columbia/security-services-act-government-of-canada-british-columbia/ |title=Security Services Act |publisher= Security Guards in Canada}}</ref> and the ''Security Services Regulation''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bclaws.ca/Recon/document/freeside/--%20s%20--/security%20services%20act%20%20sbc%202007%20%20c.%2030/05_regulations/10_207_2008.xml |title=Security Services Regulation |accessdate=2009-03-12 |publisher=Government of British Columbia}}</ref> These laws are administered and enforced by the Security Programs and Police Technology Division<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.pssg.gov.bc.ca/securityindustry/ |title=Security Programs and Police Technology Division |accessdate=2009-03-12 |publisher=British Columbia Ministry of Public Safety and Solicitor General |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090320204051/http://www.pssg.gov.bc.ca/securityindustry/ |archive-date=2009-03-20 |url-status=dead }}</ref> of the Ministry of Public Safety and Solicitor General.

Section 11(1)(c) of the Security Services Regulation prohibits security personnel from carrying or using any \"item designed for debilitating or controlling a person or animal\", which the government interprets to include all weapons. As well, section 11 forbids private security from using or carrying restraints, such as handcuffs, unless authorized by the government. However, as in other parts of Canada, armoured car officers are permitted to carry firearms. In the past, only personnel that worked for contract security, that is, security companies, were regulated in British Columbia. However, as of September 1, 2009, in-house security officers and private investigators came under the jurisdiction of the Security Services Act and Security Services Regulation. Bodyguards and bouncers, effective November 1, 2009, are also subject to these regulations.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.pssg.gov.bc.ca/securityindustry/news/index.htm |title=News and Updates |publisher=British Columbia Ministry of Public Safety and Solicitor General |accessdate=2009-06-29}}</ref>\n\n=== Europe ===\n[[File:Stockholm Pride 2015 Parade by Jonatan Svensson Glad 132.JPG|thumb|left|Security officer at 2015 [[Stockholm Pride]] Parade.]]\nArmed private security officers are much rarer in [[Europe]], and illegal in many countries, such as the [[United Kingdom]] and the [[Netherlands]]. In developing countries (with host country permission), an armed security force composed mostly of ex-military personnel is often used to protect corporate assets, particularly in [[war-torn]] regions.\n\nAs a requirement of the Private Security Industry Act 2001, the UK now requires all contract security officers to have a valid [[Security Industry Authority]] license.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.the-sia.org.uk/home/about_sia/legislation/psia.htm |title=SIA website |publisher=The-sia.org.uk |date=2009-11-26 |accessdate=2010-03-25}}</ref> The licence must be displayed when on duty, although a dispensation may be granted for store detectives, bodyguards and others who need to operate without being identified as a security guard. This dispensation is not available to Vehicle Immobilisers. Licenses are valid for three years and require the holders to undergo formal training, and are also to pass mandatory Criminal Records Bureau checks. Licences for Vehicle Immobilisers are valid for one year. Armed guarding and guarding with a weapon are illegal.\n\nIn [[Finland]], all contract security officers are required to have a valid license granted by police. Temporary license is valid for four months and normal license for five years. License requires a minimum 40-hour course for temporary license and 80 hours more for a normal license. Additionally a narrow security vetting is required. The 40-hour course does not allow the guard to carry any kind of special equipment such as a baton or handcuffs. Guards have to complete the 80-hour course to carry these. Separate training and license is required for the security guard to carry [[pepper spray]], extendable baton or a firearm. Rehearse of weapons usage is mandatory every year and is regulated by the Ministry of The Interior, to ensure the safe handling of pepper spray and such. Firearms can only be carried by [[bodyguard]]s and [[cash-in-transit]] guards or when guarding a person or object that is significant in terms of public interest.<ref>{{cite web|title=Private Security Services Act|url=http://finlex.fi/en/laki/kaannokset/2002/en20020282.pdf|accessdate=7 September 2014}}</ref> In Finland, a security guard has the right to detain a person \"red-handed\", or seen committing a crime and the right to search the detained individual for harmful items and weapons. An individual who has been forcefully detained can only be released by the police. All companies providing security guarding services are also required to have a valid license from [[Ministry of the Interior (Finland)|the Ministry of the Interior]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.intermin.fi/turvavalvontayksikko |title=Ministry of the Interior unit for supervision of the private security industry |publisher=Intermin.fi |accessdate=2010-03-25 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100226013623/http://www.intermin.fi/turvavalvontayksikko |archive-date=2010-02-26 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\nIn the [[Netherlands]], security officers ([[beveiligingsbeambte]]) must undergo a criminal background check by the local police department in the area where the [[private security company]] is located. To become a security guard in the Netherlands, a person must complete the basic training level 2 [[Beveiliger2]]. To complete the training a trainee must undergo a three-month internship with a private security company that is licensed by the [[svpb]], the board that controls security exams. A trainee guard must pass for his diploma within one year. If the trainee does not pass he is not allowed to work anymore until he completes his training with a positive result. After a positive result a new ID can be issued and is valid for three years, after which the officer must undergo a background check by the local police again. Security officers in the Netherlands are not allowed to carry any kind of weapon or handcuffs. Every uniformed security guard in the Netherlands must have the V symbol on his or her uniform to advise the public they are dealing with a private guard; this rule is mandated by the Ministry of Justice. Security uniforms may not look like similar to police uniforms, and may not contain any kind of rank designation. The colors yellow and gold are not allowed to be used because the Dutch police uses gold accents in their uniforms; also, wearing a uniform cap is not allowed. Every new uniform design or addition must be approved by the Ministry of Justice before use. A patrol vehicle may not look like a police striped vehicle. The only private security officers who are allowed to carry firearms are those who work for the military or Dutch National bank ([[De Nederlandsche Bank]]); this is where the national gold reserve can be found.\n\n==== Norway ====\n[[File:VaktServiceMobil1.jpg|thumb|Security officer with vehicle in Norway.]]\nIn [[Norway]] security officers are called \"Vektere\". There are two different types of vektere{{mdash}}the normal uniformed or civil-clothing officers who watch over private and semi-public properties, and government-hired vektere who work in public places, such as the Parliament. The law provides more enforcement powers to security officers in the Parliament than to private security officers. Security officers must undergo five weeks of training and internship. It is also possible to choose Security as a high school major, which requires two years of school and two years of trainee positions at private companies, resulting in a certificate from the government. This certificate makes it easier to get a job, with slightly higher pay. It also makes it easier to get a job elsewhere in the security industry. The certificate can also be obtained by private security officers who have had a minimum of 5 years working experience. No security officer may carry pepper spray, batons or any other kind of weapon. However, handcuffs may be used. Norges Bank (Bank of Norway, federal reserves) had armed government guards until late 2013, when they were disarmed by the minister of finance. Security officers serving on ships sailing in areas of high piracy risk may be equipped with firearms. Uniforms should not resemble police worn attire, but some uniforms do. The uniform must have the text 'VEKTER' or 'SIKKERHET' above the left shirt pocket.\n\nA security officer, or any other person, may detain or arrest anyone that violates any law, as long as the violation carries a punishment of minimum six (6) months imprisonment and a fine. The detainee must be released or handed over to the authorities within 4 hours of the arrest. Security officers assigned to public transportation, such as trains, subways, trams and buses, also have some powers under the Transportloven (transportation law). Security officers may issue fixed penalty tickets for violation of parking regulations in designated areas and for passengers on public transportation without a valid pass. A security officer may only search (frisk) a person to prevent the use of or confiscate any type of weapon or anything that can be used as a weapon. In 2006, some security officers (Vakt Service/Nokas) were given extended training and limited police authority to transport prisoners between police holding cells, jails and courts, etc. Due to an outcry from the police union, this program was scrapped after a few months.\n\nIn addition to normal \"vektere\" there also is a special branch for \"Ordensvakter\" who normally work as [[bouncer (doorman)|bouncers]] or security at concerts and similar types of events. Ordensvakter have to undergo an extra week of training to learn techniques on how to handle drunk people and people on various drugs. They also learn about the alcohol laws of [[Norway]] (which are rather strict). The police in the local police district must approve each Ordensvakt. These special regulations arose after events in the 1990s when bouncers had a bad reputation, especially in [[Oslo]], for being too brutal and rough with people. At that time, the police had no control over who worked as bouncers. After the government implemented training and mandatory police-issued ID cards for bouncers the problems have been reduced. The police of Oslo report that Ordensvakter are now helping the police identify crimes that otherwise would not be reported. In 2013, due to a high number of rapes and violent robberies, the city of Oslo (Oslo Kommune) hired a private security company (Metro Garda) to patrol the downtown immigrant areas. This patrol had a positive effect, and the city has, in addition to Metro Garda officers, now hired their own officers called Bymilj\u00f8etaten (City environment dep). The municipalities in Norway are not allowed to form their own \"police\". The only police force in Norway is the federal police (politi).\n\nIn 2007, several officers from the [[Securitas AB]] company were arrested for brutality against a robber they apprehended on the main street of Oslo. The crime was captured with a mobile camera by pedestrians and created a public outcry, with many objecting to the way the security guards took the law into their own hands. Later, it came to light that the thief first attacked the security guards when they approached him, so the brutality charges were dropped.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dagbladet.no/nyheter/2007/12/14/521246.html |title=F\u00e5r ingen konsekvenser for vekterne |publisher=dagbladet.no |date= |accessdate=2007-12-14}}</ref> As a result of this episode, the police said that they would be more careful when conducting criminal background checks for security guards. Before 2007 security guards were checked when they applied for a job, but not while they were working. Security companies were also criticized for not checking criminal records sufficiently, in some cases not at all. Now guards working in private security must be checked annually. The police have the authority to withdraw a company's licence if the company does not submit lists of employees to the police. The police in Norway were widely criticized for not checking guards properly, and even when they encounter an issue with a guard, the guard can still work for months before anything is done. The security company [[G4S]], after being criticized by police for hiring criminals, stated that they cannot do anything about the problem, because only the police have the ability to check the guard's criminal records.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ringblad.no/jobb/article4876392.ece|title=Ringerikes Blad - Kriminelle vektere slipper unna|website=www.ringblad.no}}</ref>\n\nIn 2012, Norwegian media reported that off-duty police officers and Home Guard soldiers had contracts of armed employment on civilian ships in the Aden bay, and police leaders were planning sanctions against the use of police officers.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://klassekampen.no/59975/article/item/null/krigar-i-privat-teneste |title=Private sikkerheitsselskap leiger ut heimevernssoldatar og politimenn som v\u00e6pna vakter p\u00e5 norske skip.

The staff who work under security officers' supervision are called\n''Security Guards''.\n\n====Legislation====\nBefore 1 October 1996, private security personnel were regulated by the ''Watchmen Ordinance'' (Chapter 299). However, there were many problems with that system of regulation\u2014for example, there were no restrictions as to whom may establish private security service companies to provide security services to a client. Also, there was no regulation of people whom may perform installation of security systems. Some employers hired \"caretakers\" instead of security guards to avoid their responsibilities under the ordinance (in formal definition, \"caretakers\" are supposed to provide facilities management service, although security service, which provided to residential properties, takes some parts of facilities management service). As a result, the Hong Kong Government enacted a wholly new law, the ''Security and Guarding Services Ordinance'' (Chapter 460), to replace the ''Watchmen Ordinance''.\n\nAccording to the ''Security and Guarding Services Ordinance'':\nNo individual shall do, agree to do, or hold himself/herself out as doing, or as available to do, security work for another person unless he/she does so-\n* Under and in accordance with a permit; or\n* Otherwise than for reward.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.hklii.org/hk/legis/en/ord/460/s10.html |title=Security and Guarding Services Ordinance - Sect 10 Restrictions on doing security work |publisher=Hklii.org |date= |accessdate=2010-03-25}}</ref>\n\n''Security work'' means any of the following activities-\n* Guarding any property;\n* Guarding any person or place for the purpose of preventing or detecting the occurrence of any offence; (Replaced 25 of 2000 s. 2)\n* Installing, maintaining or repairing a security device;\n* Designing for any particular premises or place a system incorporating a security device.\n\n''Security device'' means a device designed or adapted to be\ninstalled in any premises or place, except on or in a vehicle, for the purpose\nof detecting or recording- (Amended 25 of 2000 s. 2)\n* The occurrence of any offence; or\n* The presence of an intruder or of an object that persons are, for reasons of security, not permitted to bring onto the premises or place or any other premises or place.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.hklii.org/hk/legis/en/ord/460/s2.html |title=Security and Guarding Services Ordinance - Sect 2 Interpretation |publisher=Hklii.org |date=1997-06-30 |accessdate=2010-03-25}}</ref>\n\n==Qualification==\nQualification for security guards vary from country to country. Different requirements have to be completed before applying for this job.\n\n===Hong Kong===\n[[File:HK Security001.jpg|thumb|center|501px|<center>A group of Hong Kong security guards in formation before going on duty</center>]]\n\nAny applicant who wishes to apply for a Security Personnel Permit (SPP) must:\n* He/she have been living in Hong Kong for at least 5 years. (This requirement may have been changed)\n* No criminal record.\n* At least 17 years old when submitting his/her application.\n* Have passed a mandatory 16-hour training course and have been granted a certificate of the course.\n* If the applicant is over 65 years old, he/she must submit his/her health examination report.\n\n====Permit====\nSecurity Personnel Permit was separated to four types: A, B, C, and D.\n* Type A permit holder was permitted to work in a \"single-block\" residential building; they are not allowed to carry firearms. No age limit.\n* Type B permit holder was permitted to work in any type of properties, but they also are not allowed carry firearms. The maximum age limit of this permit is 65.\n* Type C permit holder was permitted to work as an armed guard. (Usually, they are members of the cash transport car crew.) The maximum age limit of this permit is 55.\n* Type D permit holder was permitted to design, install, and repair security devices. No maximum age limit.\nThe permit is valid for five years. All holders must renew their permit before it expires, or they will lose their qualification to work, as such, until their permit is renewed.\n\nThe type A and Type B security service are gradually combined with [[property management]] service, though the boundary between these two industries is unclear.\n\n====Power of arrest====\nSecurity Guards in [[Hong Kong]] do not have special powers of arrest above that of the ordinary citizen, i.e. [[citizen's arrest]], also known locally as the \"101 arrest power\". The Section 101 in the Criminal Procedure Ordinance addresses that arrest of an offender by a private citizen is allowed in certain circumstances if the offender is attempting an arrestable offense. Once arrested, the suspect must be delivered to a police office as soon as possible. An arrestable offence is defined as any crime carrying a sentence of more than 12 months imprisonment. No security personnel are allowed to search other person, nor are they allowed to get personal information from other people, with the exception of some specific circumstances.\n\n=== Israel ===\nIn [[Israel]], almost all security guards carry a firearm, primarily to prevent [[terror attack]]s. Security guards are common: they perform entrance checks at shopping malls, transportation terminals, government and other office buildings, and many stores. Many locations with a high number of visitors, such as the [[Jerusalem Central Bus Station]], employ X-ray machines to check passenger's bags; in other places, they are opened and visually inspected. Since 2009, private security guards companies as [[Mikud (company)|Mikud]] have also replaced official security forces at some checkpoints inside and on the border of the [[West Bank]], as well as the crossings to [[Gaza Strip|Gaza]].\n\n=== Malaysia ===\n[[File:IMAGO Security .jpg|thumb|left|Security officers at KK Times Square in [[Kota Kinabalu]].]]\nThe private security industry is regulated by the Ministry of Home Affairs (Kementerian Dalam Negeri). As of 2018, all private security companies in Malaysia must have a minimum of 80% of their employees complete a Certified Security Guard Training Course <ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.unityforce.com.my/unity_force_kdn.pdf|title=Surat Latihan CSG, Certified Security Guard (CSG) Training|publisher=Kementerian Dalam Negeri|accessdate=2014-12-23}}</ref> in order to receive approval to renew their Private Agency License.

Security guards have the same powers of arrest as a private citizen, called a \"private person\" arrest, \"any person\" arrest, or \"[[citizen's arrest]]\". If weapons are carried, additional permits and training are usually required. Armed security personnel are generally employed to protect sensitive sites such as government and military installations, armored money transports, casinos, banks and other financial institutions, and nuclear power plants. However, armed security is quickly becoming a standard for vehicle patrol officers and on many other non-government sites.\n\nIn some states, companies are developing technology to enhance private security. Using behavior analysis, computers can detect threats more quickly with fewer errors in judgement. Using specific algorithms, a computer can now detect aggressive and defensive body language, which triggers an alert to security or proper authorities depending on the event. These systems can also track slips and falls, theft and other events commonly experienced in corporate America.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.amrelitech.com/amrelitech/DesktopDefault.aspx?tabindex=1&tabid=84|title=Amreli Technology Solutions|website=www.amrelitech.com}}</ref> The responsibilities of security guards in the United States are expanding in scope. For example, a trend is the increasing use of private security to support services previously provided by police departments. [[James F. Pastor]] addresses substantive legal and public policy issues which directly or indirectly relate to the provision of security services. These can be demonstrated by the logic of alternative or supplemental service providers. The use of [[private police]] has particular appeal because property or business owners can directly contract for [[public safety]] services, thereby providing welcome relief for municipal budgets. Finally, private police functions can be flexible, depending upon the financial, organizational, political, and circumstances of the client.<ref>{{cite book|title=The Privatization of Police In America: An Analysis and Case Study|last=Pastor|first=James F.|year=2003|isbn=978-0-7864-1574-8|publisher=McFarland|location=Jefferson, NC}}</ref>\n\n'''Arizona''' \u2014 Licensed security companies are required to provide eight hours of pre-assignment training to all persons employed as security guards before the employee acts in the capacity of a security guard.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://law.onecle.com/arizona/professions-and-occupations/32-2632.html |title=Archived copy |access-date=2010-01-21 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110123224009/http://law.onecle.com/arizona/professions-and-occupations/32-2632.html |archive-date=2011-01-23 |url-status=dead }}</ref> There is a state-mandated curriculum that must be taught, and subjects covered must include criminal law and laws of arrest, uniforms and grooming, communications, use of force, general security procedures, crime scene preservation, ethics, and first response.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://licensing.azdps.gov/SGEightHourTrainingSyllabus.PDF|title=Licensing - Arizona Department of Public Safety|website=licensing.azdps.gov}}</ref>\n\n[[File:ADT Bel-Air Patrol Vehicle.jpg|thumb|An ADT Bel-Air Patrol vehicle]]\n'''California''' \u2014 Security Guards are required to obtain a license from the Bureau of Security and Investigative Services (BSIS), of the [[California Department of Consumer Affairs]].

In essence, security officers keep private property / persons safe from hazards, whereas police officers protect entire communities by enforcing laws and arresting suspected offenders. Some jurisdictions do commission or deputize security officers and give them limited additional powers, particularly when employed in protecting public property such as mass transit stations. This is a special case that is often unique to a particular jurisdiction or locale. Additionally, security officers may also be called upon to act as an agent of law enforcement if a police officer, sheriff's deputy, etc. is in immediate need of help and has no available backup.\n\nSome security officers do have reserve police powers and are typically employed directly by governmental agencies. Typically, these are sworn law enforcement personnel whose duties primarily involve the security of a government installation, and are also a special case. Other local and state governments occasionally enter into special contracts with security agencies to provide patrol services in public areas. These personnel are sometimes referred to as \"private police officers\". Sometimes, police officers work as security personnel while not on duty. This is usually done for extra income, and work is particularly done in hazardous jobs such as [[bodyguard]] work and [[Bouncer (doorman)|bouncers]] outside nightclubs. Police are called in when a situation warrants a higher degree of authority to act upon reported observations that security does not have the authority to act upon. However, some states allow Licensed Security Officers full arrest powers equal to those of a Sheriff's Deputy.\n\nIn 1976, the [[Law Enforcement Assistance Administration]]'s National Advisory Commission on Criminal Justice Standards and Goals reported:\n\n<blockquote>One massive resource, filled with significant numbers of personnel, armed with a wide array of technology, and directed by professionals who have spent their entire adult lifetimes learning how to prevent and reduce crime, has not been tapped by governments in the fight against criminality. The private security industry, with over one million workers, sophisticated alarm systems and perimeter safeguards, armored trucks, sophisticated mini-computers, and thousands of highly skilled crime prevention experts, offers a potential for coping with crime that can not be equalled by any other remedy or approach.... Underutilized by police, all but ignored by prosecutors and the judiciary, and unknown to corrections officials, the private security professional may be the only person in this society who has the knowledge to effectively prevent crime.<ref>{{Cite journal|author=National Advisory Commission on Criminal Justice Standards and Goals (NAC-CJSG)|year=1976|title=Private Security: Report of the Task Force on Private Security|location=Washington, DC|publisher=U.S. Department of Justice, Law Enforcement Assistance Administration}}</ref></blockquote>\n\nIn New York City, the [[Area Police/Private Security Liaison]] program was organized in 1986 by the NYPD commissioner and four former police chiefs working in the private security industry to promote mutual respect, cross-training, and sharing of crime-related information between public police and private security.\n\n== Trends ==\n\n===Australia===\nPrivate Security personnel initially outnumbered police. From the Australian Bureau of Statistics Report in 2006 there were 52,768 full-time security officers in the security industry compared to 44,898 police officers. But since Security Industry Regulation Act 2007 it has dropped to less than half that.\n\n===United Kingdom===\nThe trend in the UK at the time of writing (March 2008) is one of polarisation. The market in Manned Guarding (the security industry term for the security guards most people are familiar with) is diverging toward two opposite extremes; one typified by a highly trained and well paid security officer; the other with security officers on or about [[minimum wage]] with only the minimum training required by law. Within the \"in-house\" sector, where security personnel are not subject to licensing under the [[Security Industry Authority|Private Security Industry Act 2001]], the same divergence can be seen, with some companies opting for in-house security to maintain control of their standards, while others use it as a route to cheaper, non-regulated, security. In a very few cases, such as the [[Northern Ireland Security Guard Service]], security guards may be [[Police oath|attested]] as [[Special Constable]]s.\n\n===United States===\nEconomist [[Robert B. Reich]], in his 1991 book ''[[The Work of Nations]]'', stated that in the United States, the number of private security guards and officers was comparable to the number of publicly paid police officers. He used this phenomenon as an example of the general withdrawal of the affluent from existing communities where governments provide public services. Instead, the wealthy pay to provide their own premium services, through voluntary, exclusive associations. As taxpayer resistance has limited government budgets, and as the demand for secure homes in [[gated communities]] has grown, these trends have continued in the 1990s and 2000s. In the aftermath of the [[September 11, 2001 attacks]], the trend in the US is one of a quiet transformation of the role of security guards into first responders in case of a [[terrorist attack]] or major disaster. This has resulted in longer guard instruction hours, extra training in terrorism tactics and increased laws governing private security companies in some states.\n\n== History ==\n[[File:Standing Guard.jpg|thumb|Standing Guard]]\n\nThe ''[[vigiles]]'' were soldiers assigned to guard the city of [[Ancient Rome|Rome]], often credited as the origin of both security personnel and police, although their principal duty was as a [[firefighter|fire brigade]]. There have been night watchmen since at least the [[Middle Ages]] in Europe; walled cities of ancient times also had watchmen. A special chair appeared in Europe sometime in the late Middle Ages, called the [[watchman's chair]]; this unupholstered wooden chair had a forward slanting seat to prevent the watchman from dozing off during duty.\n\n== Notable individuals ==\n* In June 1972, [[Frank Wills (security guard)|Frank Wills]], a security guard at the [[Watergate complex|Watergate office complex]] in [[Washington, D.C.]], noticed a piece of tape covering the latch on an entrance to one of the buildings, thereby preventing it from locking. Police, whom Wills subsequently notified, arrested five men in the portion of the building occupied by the [[Democratic National Committee|Democratic National Committee (DNC)]] headquarters. The following investigations and revelations \u2014 entirely enabled by Wills' discoveries and subsequent actions \u2014 ultimately led to the resignation of [[Richard Nixon|President Richard Nixon]] in what is now infamously known as the [[Watergate scandal]], considered by many to be the largest [[political scandal]] in the history of the [[United States]].\n* [[Christoph Meili]], night guard at a [[Switzerland|Swiss]] bank, became a [[whistle blower]] in 1997. He told about the bank destroying records related to funds of [[Holocaust]] victims, whose money the bank was supposed to return to their heirs.\n* In 1999, [[Pierlucio Tinazzi]] rescued 10 victims from the [[Mont Blanc Tunnel#The 1999 fire|Mont Blanc Tunnel Fire]], before dying while trying to rescue an eleventh.\n* In 2001, [[Gary Coleman]], former child actor, was employed as an armed security officer, with permits valid for both Firearm and Baton through the Bureau of Security and Investigative Services of California in the Los Angeles area. While shopping for a bullet-resistant vest for his job, Coleman assaulted a female autograph collector. Coleman said he felt \"threatened by her insistence\" and punched her in the head.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.courttv.com/archive/trials/coleman/020499.html |title=court TV becomes truTV |publisher=Courttv.com |accessdate=2010-03-25 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081219015819/http://www.courttv.com/archive/trials/coleman/020499.html |archivedate=2008-12-19 }}</ref> He was later charged for the assault and ordered to pay her $1,665 for hospital bills. This also ended up getting his guard card and firearms permits revoked, however his baton permit is still valid until the year 2045. It is unknown why the other two permits were revoked but his baton permit remains. He is not allowed to carry the baton while he is not physically working as a security officer. (Firearms and baton permits issued through BSIS are open carry permits, and you are required to be in uniform, and at work, on your way to or from work to carry them otherwise a separate permit must be issued by the county in California that the individual resides to carry said item off duty.)\n* Derrick Brun, an unarmed security officer employed by the Red Lake School District in Minnesota, was praised by President Bush for his heroic role in protecting children during the 2005 [[Red Lake shootings]]: \"Derrick's bravery cost him his life, and all Americans honor him\".<ref>{{cite web|url=https://georgewbush-whitehouse.archives.gov/news/releases/2005/03/20050326.html |title=President's Radio Address |publisher=Georgewbush-whitehouse.archives.gov |date=2005-03-26 |accessdate=2010-03-25}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.usafreedomcorps.gov/about_usafc/update/update.asp?ID=81 |title=Welcome to Serve.gov |publisher=Usafreedomcorps.gov |accessdate=2010-03-25 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090109235011/http://www.usafreedomcorps.gov/about_usafc/update/update.asp?ID=81 |archive-date=2009-01-09 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n* In 2007, [[2007 Colorado YWAM and New Life shootings|Matthew Murray]] fatally shot two and wounded two others at the Youth With A Mission retreat center in Arvada, Colorado. A few hours later he fatally shot two others and wounded another three in the New Life Church parking lot. When Murray entered the church, he was met by armed security officer Jeanne Assam, who ordered him to drop his weapon. Assam shot and wounded Murray when he failed to comply. The pastor of New Life Church credited Assam with saving over 100 lives.\n* [[Richard Jewell]], a security officer at [[Atlanta, Georgia]]'s [[Centennial Olympic Park]] during the [[1996 Summer Olympics]] who was wrongly accused of the [[Centennial Olympic Park bombing]]. Jewell was later cleared of those charges, and was in fact the one who saved hundreds of lives when he first noticed the suspicious package and got the area evacuated. Jewell later successfully sued several news agencies who reported him as the criminal prior to having the facts.\n\n==Unionization==\n===Canada===\nMany security guards in Canada are unionized. The primary unions which represent security guards in Canada are the [[United Food and Commercial Workers]] (UFCW),<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ufcw.ca/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=59&Itemid=92&lang=en|title=UFCW Canada - Canada's Private Sector Union|website=UFCW Canada - Canada\u2019s Private Sector Union}}</ref> Local 333, and the Canadian branch of the [[United Steelworkers]] (USW). In contrast to the legal restrictions in the United States, Canadian labour relations boards will certify bargaining units of security guards for a [[Canadian Labour Congress]] (CLC)-affiliated union or in the same union with other classifications of employees.\n\n===United States===\nIn June 1947, the [[United States Congress]] passed the [[Taft-Hartley Act]] placing many restrictions on [[labor union]]s. Section 9 (B) (3) of the act prevents the [[National Labor Relations Board]] (NLRB) from certifying for collective bargaining any unit which mixes security employees with non-security employees. This restricts the ability of security employees to join any union that also represents other types of employees. They may be part of an independent, \"security-only\" union, not affiliated with any coalition of other types of labor unions such as the [[American Federation of Labor and Congress of Industrial Organizations]] (AFL-CIO). A union which also represents non-security employees may also represent and bargain on behalf of security employees with the employer's consent. Two of the largest security unions are the '''Security, Police, and Fire Professionals of America'''(SPFPA) and the '''United Government Security Officers of America'''(UGSOA).\n\n====Security, Police, and Fire Professionals of America====\nIn 1948 with the Taft-Hartley restrictions well into effect, the [[Detroit]], [[Michigan]] area security guards of [[United Auto Workers]] (UAW) Amalgamated Local 114 were forced to break away and start a separate \"Plant Guards Organizing Committee\". The NLRB ruled that as an affiliate of the CIO, the committee was indirectly affiliated with production unions and therefore ineligible for certification under the new restrictions. The committee was then forced to completely withdraw from the CIO and start the independent United Plant Guard Workers of America. By the 1990s, this union had evolved to include many other types of security officers and changed its name to the SPFPA.\n\n====United Government Security Officers of America====\nIn 1992, the UGSOA was formed. It specializes in organizing federal, state, and local government security officers, but since May, 2000 has been open to representing other types of security personnel as well.\n\n====Others====\nThe Service Employees International Union (SEIU) has also sought to represent security employees, although its efforts have been complicated by the Taft-Harley Act because the SEIU also represents janitors, trash collectors, and other building service employees.\n\n==See also==\n{{col-start}}\n{{col-break}}\n* [[Access control]]\n* [[Airport security]]\n* [[Armored car (valuables)]]\n* [[Bodyguard]]\n* [[Bounty hunter]]\n* [[Certified Protection Officer]]\n* [[Commissionaire]]\n* [[Hotel detective|Hotel Detective]]\n* [[List of Private Security Companies]]\n* [[Loss prevention]]\n* [[Northern Ireland Security Guard Service]]\n{{col-break}}\n* [[Physical Security]]\n* [[Police officer|Police Officer]]\n* [[Private investigator]]\n* [[Private military company]]\n* [[Private security company]]\n* [[Security]]\n<!-- * [[Security Patrol Software]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.kerkton.com/|title=Security Software Provider - Security Guard Software - Records Management System|first=Kerkton Security Technologies, LLC|last=[www.kerkton.com]|website=Private Security Software - Kerkton Security Technologies}}</ref> -->\n* [[Security police]]\n* [[Store detective|Store Detective]]\n* [[Traffic guard|Traffic Guard]]\n* [[Transportation security officer]]\n* [[Use of force continuum]]\n{{col-end}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|colwidth=30em}}\n\n==External links==\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20080708210746/http://www.mcscs.jus.gov.on.ca/english/police_serv/PISG/licences.html Ontario Ministry of Community Safety and Correctional Services information page on new private security legislation introduced in August, 2007]\n* [http://www.the-sia.org.uk/home/about_sia/legislation/psia.htm UK private security industry legislation]\n* [http://www.smallarmssurvey.org/fileadmin/docs/H-Research_Notes/SAS-Research-Note-4.pdf Small Arms Survey Research Note: Private Security Companies' Firearms Stockpiles]\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Security Guard}}\n[[Category:Security guards| ]]\n[[Category:Protective service occupations]]\n[[Category:Crime prevention]]\n[[Category:Physical security]]\n[[Category:Public safety|Guard]]\n[[Category:Law enforcement occupations]]\n[[Category:Surveillance]]\n[[Category:Law enforcement]]\n", "name_user": "Ahmediftikhar121", "label": "unsafe", "comment": "(\u2192\u200eReferences)", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Security_guard"}
