With that letter, he was able to solicit and obtain a large collection of books, magazines, computers, and software for the new university.{{citation needed|date=April 2020}}\n\nThere being no Anglican Faith based university in North America out of the seven that contributed materials to start TCUEA, the conservative Anglican clergy feared that the institution would be \"highjacked\" by the charismatic Christian Churches, proliferating across the Continents at that time.{{citation needed|date=April 2020}}\n\nIn 1995, \"The Christian University of East Africa\" with some government involvement was annexed by the Anglican Diocese of Luweero, in the Province of the [[Church of Uganda]].

The film stars [[Alicia Vikander]] as Vera Brittain, an independent young woman who abandoned her studies at [[Somerville College, Oxford|Somerville College]], [[University of Oxford|Oxford]], to become a war nurse.<ref name=rvw>{{cite news|last1=Kermode|first1=Mark|title=Testament of Youth review \u2013 tame adaptation of Vera Brittain\u2019s book|url=https://www.theguardian.com/film/2015/jan/18/testament-of-youth-review-tame-adaptation-vera-brittain-book|accessdate=18 April 2015|work=The Guardian|date=18 January 2015}}</ref>  The film was directed by James Kent and written by Juliette Towhidi.\n\n==Plot==\nIn 1914, [[Vera Brittain]] wants to escape her traditional family in [[Buxton]] by attending [[Oxford University]] with her younger brother [[Edward Brittain|Edward]] and his friends at [[Uppingham School]], [[Roland Leighton]] and [[Victor Richardson (soldier)|Victor Richardson]]. Against her father's opposition, she passes the entrance examination for [[Somerville College, Oxford]]. Before enrolling at Oxford, Vera and Roland\u2014who shares her interest in writing and poetry\u2014begin a romance, although she knows that Victor is in love with her.\n\nAfter the [[assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand]] starts [[World War I]], Vera helps convince her father to let Edward join the army instead of studying at Oxford; Roland and Victor also join, and Roland is the first to reach the [[Western Front of World War I|Western Front]]. As long lists of casualties appear in newspapers, Vera leaves Oxford to volunteer for the [[Voluntary Aid Detachment]] as a nurse tending the wounded in a hospital in England.\n\nHis friends still see the war as exciting, but Roland tells Vera of his traumatic experiences from [[trench warfare]] at the front. He proposes to Vera; they will marry during his next home leave. Roland returns to France, now with Edward. Roland writes in late 1915 that he has been granted leave, and is safe away from the front. As Vera awaits his arrival during the Christmas holiday, Roland's crying sister, Claire, tells her on the telephone that he has been killed.\n\nThe army tells Vera and Roland's family that he died \"bravely and painlessly\". After she demands the truth, [[George Catlin (political scientist)|George Catlin]], who saw the wounded Roland in [[Louvencourt]], admits that Roland died from his abdomen gunshot wound in agonising pain. When Victor, blind from his own injuries, arrives at Vera's hospital, she proposes to him because he is \"going to need someone\" and \"I... Well, Roland would like it\", but he gently turns her down before suddenly dying from his head injury.\n\nIn 1917, Vera asks to transfer to France to be closer to Edward, but her first assignment is to treat wounded Germans. She is reluctant, but learns that they suffer and die like English soldiers. Vera finds Edward among the dying, and helps to save his life. After recovery she is glad that he is sent to the safer [[Italian Front (World War I)|Italian Front]]. Edward insists that Vera return to her Oxford studies after the war.\n\nVera returns home after her mother has a nervous breakdown. She sees a telegram being delivered and learns, from her father's weeping, that Edward has died. With the death of Geoffrey Thurlow, another friend of Edward's, Vera has now lost in the war the four young men closest to her.\n \nIn 1918 Vera cannot celebrate as crowds cheer the [[Armistice with Germany]]. Back at Oxford, she has nightmares about Roland's and Edward's deaths. [[Winifred Holtby]], another student at the college, helps Vera cope with her trauma.\n\nVera attends a public meeting where speakers debate [[Treaty of Versailles|how to punish Germany for the war]]. Most of the audience is against George Caitlin, who warns that \"the philosophy of '[[an eye for an eye]]'\" could cause another war. Vera confesses her guilt over persuading her father to let Edward join the army, and tells of how she held the hand of a dying German soldier, who was no different from her brother or her fianc\u00e9. She says that their deaths have meaning \"only if we stand together now and say 'No'\" to war and revenge.\n\nNow a pacifist, Vera promises to her dead men that she will not forget them. The film ends with a dedication:\n\n{| style=\"margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; border: none;\"\n|-\n! ''In Memory of''\n|-\n| [[Roland Leighton]] || 1895 \u2013 1915\n|-\n| [[Victor Richardson (soldier)|Victor Richardson]] || 1895 \u2013 1917\n|-\n| Geoffrey Thurlow || 1895 \u2013 1917\n|-\n| [[Edward Brittain]] || 1895 \u2013 1918\n|}\n\nThe plot of the film broadly follows narrative of the book, but does deviate in two areas: George Catlin who entered the army in 1918, never met Roland who died in 1915. In addition, Vera did not help save her brother Edward's life after he was wounded at the Somme in 1916 - he was simply sent to the 1st London General Hospital where she was a volunteer nurse.\n\n==Cast==\n{{div col}}\n* [[Alicia Vikander]] as [[Vera Brittain]]\n* [[Kit Harington]] as [[Roland Leighton]]<ref name=\"Kit\" />\n* [[Colin Morgan]] as [[Victor Richardson (soldier)|Victor Richardson]]<ref name=\"Taron-Colin-Alexandra\" />\n* [[Taron Egerton]] as [[Edward Brittain]]<ref name=\"Taron-Colin-Alexandra\" />\n* [[Dominic West]] as Mr Brittain<ref name=\"filming-cast\" />\n* [[Emily Watson]] as Mrs Brittain<ref name=\"filming-cast\" />\n* [[Joanna Scanlan]] as Aunt Belle<ref name=\"filming-cast\" />\n* [[Hayley Atwell]] as Hope<ref name=\"filming-cast\" />\n* [[Jonathan Bailey (actor)|Jonathan Bailey]] as Geoffrey Thurlow<ref name=\"filming-cast\" />\n* [[Alexandra Roach]] as [[Winifred Holtby]]<ref name=\"Taron-Colin-Alexandra\" />\n* [[Anna Chancellor]] as Mrs Leighton<ref name=\"filming-cast\" />\n* [[Miranda Richardson]] as [[Hilda Lorimer|Miss Lorimer]]\n* [[Charlotte Hope]] as Betty\n{{div col end}}\n\n==Production==\nIn February 2009, it was announced that [[BBC Films]] was developing a feature film adaptation of memoir ''[[Testament of Youth]]'' written by [[Vera Brittain]], about women's experiences during World War I.<ref name=Brittain-film>{{cite news|last=Singh|first=Anita|title=Vera Brittain to be subject of film|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/film/4612365/Vera-Brittain-to-be-subject-of-film.html|accessdate=16 March 2014|newspaper=telegraph.co.uk|date=13 February 2009}}</ref> The BBC had previously adapted the book as a [[Testament of Youth (TV series)|five-part television serial]] which was transmitted on [[BBC Two|BBC2]] in 1979 with [[Cheryl Campbell]] as Vera Brittain.\n\nFilm development had the support of [[Shirley Williams]], Brittain's daughter, and of [[Mark Bostridge]], Brittain's biographer, editor, and one of her literary executors, who was reportedly acting as consultant on the film.

The film stars [[Alicia Vikander]] as Vera Brittain, an independent young woman who abandoned her studies at [[Somerville College, Oxford|Somerville College]], [[University of Oxford|Oxford]], to become a war nurse.<ref name=rvw>{{cite news|last1=Kermode|first1=Mark|title=Testament of Youth review \u2013 tame adaptation of Vera Brittain\u2019s book|url=https://www.theguardian.com/film/2015/jan/18/testament-of-youth-review-tame-adaptation-vera-brittain-book|accessdate=18 April 2015|work=The Guardian|date=18 January 2015}}</ref>  The film was directed by James Kent and written by Juliette Towhidi.\n\n==Plot==\nIn 1914, [[Vera Brittain]] wants to escape her traditional family in [[Buxton]] by attending [[Oxford University]] with her younger brother [[Edward Brittain|Edward]] and his friends at [[Uppingham School]], [[Roland Leighton]] and [[Victor Richardson (soldier)|Victor Richardson]]. Against her father's opposition, she passes the entrance examination for [[Somerville College, Oxford]]. Before enrolling at Oxford, Vera and Roland\u2014who shares her interest in writing and poetry\u2014begin a romance, although she knows that Victor is in love with her.\n\nAfter the [[assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand]] starts [[World War I]], Vera helps convince her father to let Edward join the army instead of studying at Oxford; Roland and Victor also join, and Roland is the first to reach the [[Western Front of World War I|Western Front]]. As long lists of casualties appear in newspapers, Vera leaves Oxford to volunteer for the [[Voluntary Aid Detachment]] as a nurse tending the wounded in a hospital in England.\n\nHis friends still see the war as exciting, but Roland tells Vera of his traumatic experiences from [[trench warfare]] at the front. He proposes to Vera; they will marry during his next home leave. Roland returns to France, now with Edward. Roland writes in late 1915 that he has been granted leave, and is safe away from the front. As Vera awaits his arrival during the Christmas holiday, Roland's crying sister, Claire, tells her on the telephone that he has been killed.\n\nThe army tells Vera and Roland's family that he died \"bravely and painlessly\". After she demands the truth, [[George Catlin (political scientist)|George Catlin]], who saw the wounded Roland in [[Louvencourt]], admits that Roland died from his abdomen gunshot wound in agonising pain. When Victor, blind from his own injuries, arrives at Vera's hospital, she proposes to him because he is \"going to need someone\" and \"I... Well, Roland would like it\", but he gently turns her down before suddenly dying from his head injury.\n\nIn 1917, Vera asks to transfer to France to be closer to Edward, but her first assignment is to treat wounded Germans. She is reluctant, but learns that they suffer and die like English soldiers. Vera finds Edward among the dying, and helps to save his life. After recovery she is glad that he is sent to the safer [[Italian Front (World War I)|Italian Front]]. Edward insists that Vera return to her Oxford studies after the war.\n\nVera returns home after her mother has a nervous breakdown. She sees a telegram being delivered and learns, from her father's weeping, that Edward has died. With the death of Geoffrey Thurlow, another friend of Edward's, Vera has now lost in the war the four young men closest to her.\n \nIn 1918 Vera cannot celebrate as crowds cheer the [[Armistice with Germany]]. Back at Oxford, she has nightmares about Roland's and Edward's deaths. [[Winifred Holtby]], another student at the college, helps Vera cope with her trauma.\n\nVera attends a public meeting where speakers debate [[Treaty of Versailles|how to punish Germany for the war]]. Most of the audience is against George Caitlin, who warns that \"the philosophy of '[[an eye for an eye]]'\" could cause another war. Vera confesses her guilt over persuading her father to let Edward join the army, and tells of how she held the hand of a dying German soldier, who was no different from her brother or her fianc\u00e9. She says that their deaths have meaning \"only if we stand together now and say 'No'\" to war and revenge.\n\nNow a pacifist, Vera promises to her dead men that she will not forget them. The film ends with a dedication:\n\n{| style=\"margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; border: none;\"\n|-\n! ''In Memory of''\n|-\n| [[Roland Leighton]] || 1895 \u2013 1915\n|-\n| [[Victor Richardson (soldier)|Victor Richardson]] || 1895 \u2013 1917\n|-\n| Geoffrey Thurlow || 1895 \u2013 1917\n|-\n| [[Edward Brittain]] || 1895 \u2013 1918\n|}\n\nThe plot of the film broadly follows narrative of the book, but does deviate in two areas: George Catlin who entered the army in 1918, never met Roland who died in 1915. In addition, Vera did not help save her brother Edward's life after he was wounded at the Somme in 1916 - he was simply sent to the 1st London General Hospital where she was a volunteer nurse.\n\n==Cast==\n{{div col}}\n* [[Alicia Vikander]] as [[Vera Brittain]]\n* [[Kit Harington]] as [[Roland Leighton]]<ref name=\"Kit\" />\n* [[Colin Morgan]] as [[Victor Richardson (soldier)|Victor Richardson]]<ref name=\"Taron-Colin-Alexandra\" />\n* [[Taron Egerton]] as [[Edward Brittain]]<ref name=\"Taron-Colin-Alexandra\" />\n* [[Dominic West]] as Mr Brittain<ref name=\"filming-cast\" />\n* [[Emily Watson]] as Mrs Brittain<ref name=\"filming-cast\" />\n* [[Joanna Scanlan]] as Aunt Belle<ref name=\"filming-cast\" />\n* [[Hayley Atwell]] as Hope<ref name=\"filming-cast\" />\n* [[Jonathan Bailey (actor)|Jonathan Bailey]] as Geoffrey Thurlow<ref name=\"filming-cast\" />\n* [[Alexandra Roach]] as [[Winifred Holtby]]<ref name=\"Taron-Colin-Alexandra\" />\n* [[Anna Chancellor]] as Mrs Leighton<ref name=\"filming-cast\" />\n* [[Miranda Richardson]] as [[Hilda Lorimer|Miss Lorimer]]\n* [[Charlotte Hope]] as Betty\n{{div col end}}\n\n==Production==\nIn February 2009, it was announced that [[BBC Films]] was developing a feature film adaptation of memoir ''[[Testament of Youth]]'' written by [[Vera Brittain]], about women's experiences during World War I.<ref name=Brittain-film>{{cite news|last=Singh|first=Anita|title=Vera Brittain to be subject of film|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/film/4612365/Vera-Brittain-to-be-subject-of-film.html|accessdate=16 March 2014|newspaper=telegraph.co.uk|date=13 February 2009}}</ref> The BBC had previously adapted the book as a [[Testament of Youth (TV series)|five-part television serial]] which was transmitted on [[BBC Two|BBC2]] in 1979 with [[Cheryl Campbell]] as Vera Brittain.\n\nFilm development had the support of [[Shirley Williams]], Brittain's daughter, and of [[Mark Bostridge]], Brittain's biographer, editor, and one of her literary executors, who was reportedly acting as consultant on the film.

This refers to an incline in the landscape between the four [[river]]s surrounding the city, [[IJssel]], [[Vecht (Overijssel)|Vecht]], Aa and [[Zwarte Water]]. The hill was the only piece of land that would remain dry during the frequent [[flooding]]s of the rivers. Zwolle was established on that incline.\n\n{{anchor|Saint Michael|Saint Michael Church|St. Michael|St. Michael Church}}\nA document mentions the existence of a [[parish]] [[Church (building)|church]] dedicated to [[St Michael]]. That church, the ''Grote'' or ''Sint Micha\u00eblskerk'' (''big'' or ''Saint Michael Church''), was renovated in the first half of the 15th century and exists to this day. The church contains a richly carved [[pulpit]], the work of [[Adam Straes van Weilborch]] (about 1620), some good carving and an exquisite [[organ (instrument)|organ]] (1721).\n\nOn August 31, 1230, the bishop of [[Bishopric of Utrecht|Utrecht]] granted Zwolle [[City rights in the Netherlands|city rights]]. Zwolle became a member of the [[Hanseatic league]] in 1294, and in 1361 joined the war between the Hanseatic League and [[Valdemar IV of Denmark]]. In the 1370 [[Treaty of Stralsund (1370)|Treaty of Stralsund]] that ended the war, Zwolle was awarded a ''vitte'', a trade colony, in [[Scania]], then part of [[Denmark]]. Zwolle's golden age came in the 15th century. Between 1402 and 1450, the city's [[Gross Regional Product]] multiplied by about six.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www2.historischcentrumoverijssel.nl/zwolle/zw/geschz4.htm|title=De handel en de Hanze|accessdate=2007-03-17|author=F.C.

The more important industries comprised [[cotton]] manufactures, iron works, boat-building, dyeing and bleaching, tanning, rope-making, and salt-making.<ref name=\"EB1911\">{{EB1911|inline=1 |wstitle=Zwolle |volume=28 |page=1064}}</ref>\n[[Image:De Librije.jpg|thumb|left|Librije]]\n\nIn [[World War II]], Zwolle was single-handedly liberated from the Germans by French Canadian soldier [[L\u00e9o Major]].<ref>https://www.britannica.com/biography/Leo-Major</ref> He was made an honorary citizen of Zwolle in 2005 and a street is named for him.\n\nIn 2004, Zwolle's [[De Librije]] restaurant was honored with 3 stars by [[Michelin Guide]]; as of 2018, it is one of only three restaurants so honored in the entire country.\n\n===Blauwvingers===\nCitizens of Zwolle are colloquially known as ''Blauwvingers'' (Bluefingers). This dates back to 1682, when the St&nbsp;Michael's church tower collapsed. The authorities were strapped for cash and saw no option but to sell the [[church bell]]s to neighbouring city [[Kampen, Overijssel|Kampen]]. To make sure that Kampen would not make too much profit from the deal, the local authorities asked a high price for the church bells. Kampen accepted, yet after the arrival of the bells it became clear, they were too damaged to be played. In revenge, Kampen paid in copper coins of four [[duit|''duiten'']] (the equivalent of two-and-a-half [[Dutch guilder|cents]]). Zwolle distrusted Kampen and wanted to be sure they truly paid the entire price. After the rigorous counting of this vast amount of money, their fingers had turned blue from the counting of money. <ref>{{cite journal|last=Boxma|first=Willem|year=2001|title=Steuren, blauwvingers, kwekweschudders en tukkers.

The Roman Catholic ''Onze Lieve Vrouwe ten Hemelopneming''-[[basilica]] (Our Lady Ascension) dates back to 1399. The church tower, called ''[[Peperbus]]'' (pepperbox), is one of the tallest and most famous church towers in the Netherlands. The modernized [[town hall]] was originally built in 1448.<ref name=\"EB1911\"/>\n\nMention should also be made of the ''Sassenpoort'' (one of the old city gates), the city walls, the ''Mosterdmakerstoren'' (''mustard makers' tower'')(the complex where local mustard used to be made), a guild-house (1571), the former provincial government offices, a [[Dominican Order|Dominican]] monastery, and on the Melkmarkt, two museums; the [[Stedelijk Museum Zwolle]] of antiquities and natural history, and the [[Vrouwenhuis, Zwolle|Vrouwenhuis]]. [[Museum de Fundatie]], the fine art museum of the province of Overijssel, is hosted in the former Justice Hall on Blijmarkt Square.\n\nIn the western part of the city, west of the railway station, there is a quarter of [[Art Nouveau]] buildings, concentrated mostly on Koningin Wilhelminastraat, Prinses Julianastraat, and Prins Hendrikstraat. These three-store living houses were built in 1900s by various Dutch architects. Eleven of the buildings are protected by the Dutch government ([[rijksmonument]]en).\n\nThe ''Broerenkerk'' church was part of the [[Dominican order|Dominican monastery]] founded in 1465. The monastery was closed in 1580 and the monks were expelled. From 1640 until 1982 the church was used for Protestant services. After a restoration in 1983-1988 it has been used for cultural events and it is now a bookstore.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.archimon.nl/overijssel/zwollebroerenkerk.html |title=Zwolle (Ov): Broerenkerk |author=<!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--> |date= |website=archimon.nl |publisher= |accessdate=August 10, 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.rickscholten.nl/page.php?id=3 |title=Waanders in the Broerenkerk |last1=Scholten |first1=Rick |last2= |first2= |date= |website= |publisher= |accessdate=August 10, 2013}}</ref>\n\n===Image gallery===\n<gallery mode=packed>\nFile:Zwolle, Thorbeckegracht.jpg|Thorbeckegracht\nFile:Peperbus, Eekwal.jpg|Peperbus from the Eekwal.

This is reflected in the high traffic volumes in and around the city. The [[A28 motorway (Netherlands)|A28]] serves Zwolle with 4 exits, and runs from Utrecht to Groningen. It is being widened to 8 lanes across the [[IJssel River]] and 6 lanes from Zwolle to Meppel in 2010 and 2011. The motorway initially opened between 1964 and 1970.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.autosnelwegen.nl/asw/dos/dosA28.htm|title=completion dates A28 at autosnelwegen.nl}}</ref> Another motorway, the [[A50 motorway (Netherlands)|A50]], interchanges with A28 just west of the city, offering a route for southbound traffic to [[Apeldoorn]] and [[Eindhoven]].\n\nThe [[Provincial road N35 (Netherlands)|N35]] highway starts in Zwolle, where it forms the eastern section of the ring road of Zwolle, it runs as a non-motorway to [[Almelo]] and continues to [[Enschede]] as [[A35 motorway (Netherlands)|A35]] motorway. The ringroad is mainly a 4-lane road, with numerous traffic lights. It forms a full ring, and also exists out of the [[Provincial road N337 (Netherlands)|N337]] highway that runs to [[Deventer]]. Other sections of the ring road are not numbered. Parts of the ring road were widened to six lanes in 2010. Other numbered highways running from Zwolle are [[Provincial road N331 (Netherlands)|N331]] to [[Hasselt, Overijssel|Hasselt]], [[Provincial road N758 (Netherlands)|N758]] to [[Nieuwleusen]], [[Provincial road N340 (Netherlands)|N340]] to [[Ommen]] and [[Provincial road N764 (Netherlands)|N764]] to [[Kampen, Overijssel|Kampen]].\n\n===Bridges===\nDue to nearby rivers, there are several major bridges in and around Zwolle. The most important bridge is the IJssel Bridge where the A28 motorway runs across. It was completed in 1970 and carries over 125.000 vehicles per day. Adjacent to this bridge is the older IJssel Bridge, which opened in 1930 and was destroyed twice during [[World War II]]. A third IJssel Bridge is the railway bridge (called Hanze boog) which carries the railway line from Zwolle to [[Amersfoort]], and from 2012, to [[Lelystad]]. There are several bridges across the [[Zwarte Water]] River, including two 4-lane bridges, a 2-lane bridge, and a bus/bicycle bridge. There is also a bridge across the [[Vecht (Overijssel)|Vecht]], which carries A28 motorway. Another local bridge is adjacent to this bridge. A third bridge carries rail traffic to [[Leeuwarden]] and [[Groningen (city)|Groningen]]. Numerous local bridges exist around the historic city center.\n\n===Rail transport===\n* [[Zwolle railway station]]\n\nThe first train in Zwolle arrived on June 6, 1864. Today the city has [[railroad|rail connections]] in eight directions (viz. [[Kampen, Overijssel|Kampen]], [[Leeuwarden]], [[Groningen (city)|Groningen]], [[Emmen, Netherlands|Emmen]], [[Enschede]], [[Arnhem]]/[[Nijmegen]], [[Lelystad]]/[[Amsterdam]], and [[Amersfoort]]).\n\nThe [[railroad|rail connection]] with [[Amsterdam]] via [[Lelystad]] \u2013 the [[Hanzelijn]] \u2013 is operational since December 2012.\n\nThe second station, [[Zwolle Stadshagen railway station|Zwolle Stadshagen]], was opened on 15 December 2019.\n\n===Water transport===\nZwolle is located on or near three [[river]]s ([[Zwarte Water]], [[Vecht (Overijssel)|Vecht]], and [[IJssel]]), several [[canal]]s (the now disused Willemsvaart, Nieuwe Vecht and Overijssels Kanaal and the modern Zwolle-IJssel Kanaal).

This refers to an incline in the landscape between the four [[river]]s surrounding the city, [[IJssel]], [[Vecht (Overijssel)|Vecht]], Aa and [[Zwarte Water]]. The hill was the only piece of land that would remain dry during the frequent [[flooding]]s of the rivers. Zwolle was established on that incline.\n\n{{anchor|Saint Michael|Saint Michael Church|St. Michael|St. Michael Church}}\nA document mentions the existence of a [[parish]] [[Church (building)|church]] dedicated to [[St Michael]]. That church, the ''Grote'' or ''Sint Micha\u00eblskerk'' (''big'' or ''Saint Michael Church''), was renovated in the first half of the 15th century and exists to this day. The church contains a richly carved [[pulpit]], the work of [[Adam Straes van Weilborch]] (about 1620), some good carving and an exquisite [[organ (instrument)|organ]] (1721).\n\nOn August 31, 1230, the bishop of [[Bishopric of Utrecht|Utrecht]] granted Zwolle [[City rights in the Netherlands|city rights]]. Zwolle became a member of the [[Hanseatic league]] in 1294, and in 1361 joined the war between the Hanseatic League and [[Valdemar IV of Denmark]]. In the 1370 [[Treaty of Stralsund (1370)|Treaty of Stralsund]] that ended the war, Zwolle was awarded a ''vitte'', a trade colony, in [[Scania]], then part of [[Denmark]]. Zwolle's golden age came in the 15th century.

The more important industries comprised [[cotton]] manufactures, iron works, boat-building, dyeing and bleaching, tanning, rope-making, and salt-making.<ref name=\"EB1911\">{{EB1911|inline=1 |wstitle=Zwolle |volume=28 |page=1064}}</ref>\n[[Image:De Librije.jpg|thumb|left|Librije]]\n\nIn [[World War II]], Zwolle was single-handedly liberated from the Germans by French Canadian soldier [[L\u00e9o Major]].<ref>https://www.britannica.com/biography/Leo-Major</ref> He was made an honorary citizen of Zwolle in 2005 and a street is named for him.\n\nIn 2004, Zwolle's [[De Librije]] restaurant was honored with 3 stars by [[Michelin Guide]]; as of 2018, it is one of only three restaurants so honored in the entire country.\n\n===Blauwvingers===\nCitizens of Zwolle are colloquially known as ''Blauwvingers'' (Bluefingers). This dates back to 1682, when the St&nbsp;Michael's church tower collapsed. The authorities were strapped for cash and saw no option but to sell the [[church bell]]s to neighbouring city [[Kampen, Overijssel|Kampen]]. To make sure that Kampen would not make too much profit from the deal, the local authorities asked a high price for the church bells. Kampen accepted, yet after the arrival of the bells it became clear, they were too damaged to be played. In revenge, Kampen paid in copper coins of four [[duit|''duiten'']] (the equivalent of two-and-a-half [[Dutch guilder|cents]]). Zwolle distrusted Kampen and wanted to be sure they truly paid the entire price. After the rigorous counting of this vast amount of money, their fingers had turned blue from the counting of money. <ref>{{cite journal|last=Boxma|first=Willem|year=2001|title=Steuren, blauwvingers, kwekweschudders en tukkers.

These three-store living houses were built in 1900s by various Dutch architects. Eleven of the buildings are protected by the Dutch government ([[rijksmonument]]en).\n\nThe ''Broerenkerk'' church was part of the [[Dominican order|Dominican monastery]] founded in 1465. The monastery was closed in 1580 and the monks were expelled. From 1640 until 1982 the church was used for Protestant services. After a restoration in 1983-1988 it has been used for cultural events and it is now a bookstore.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.archimon.nl/overijssel/zwollebroerenkerk.html |title=Zwolle (Ov): Broerenkerk |author=<!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--> |date= |website=archimon.nl |publisher= |accessdate=August 10, 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.rickscholten.nl/page.php?id=3 |title=Waanders in the Broerenkerk |last1=Scholten |first1=Rick |last2= |first2= |date= |website= |publisher= |accessdate=August 10, 2013}}</ref>\n\n===Image gallery===\n<gallery mode=packed>\nFile:Zwolle, Thorbeckegracht.jpg|Thorbeckegracht\nFile:Peperbus, Eekwal.jpg|Peperbus from the Eekwal.

This is reflected in the high traffic volumes in and around the city. The [[A28 motorway (Netherlands)|A28]] serves Zwolle with 4 exits, and runs from Utrecht to Groningen. It is being widened to 8 lanes across the [[IJssel River]] and 6 lanes from Zwolle to Meppel in 2010 and 2011. The motorway initially opened between 1964 and 1970.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.autosnelwegen.nl/asw/dos/dosA28.htm|title=completion dates A28 at autosnelwegen.nl}}</ref> Another motorway, the [[A50 motorway (Netherlands)|A50]], interchanges with A28 just west of the city, offering a route for southbound traffic to [[Apeldoorn]] and [[Eindhoven]].\n\nThe [[Provincial road N35 (Netherlands)|N35]] highway starts in Zwolle, where it forms the eastern section of the ring road of Zwolle, it runs as a non-motorway to [[Almelo]] and continues to [[Enschede]] as [[A35 motorway (Netherlands)|A35]] motorway. The ringroad is mainly a 4-lane road, with numerous traffic lights. It forms a full ring, and also exists out of the [[Provincial road N337 (Netherlands)|N337]] highway that runs to [[Deventer]]. Other sections of the ring road are not numbered. Parts of the ring road were widened to six lanes in 2010. Other numbered highways running from Zwolle are [[Provincial road N331 (Netherlands)|N331]] to [[Hasselt, Overijssel|Hasselt]], [[Provincial road N758 (Netherlands)|N758]] to [[Nieuwleusen]], [[Provincial road N340 (Netherlands)|N340]] to [[Ommen]] and [[Provincial road N764 (Netherlands)|N764]] to [[Kampen, Overijssel|Kampen]].\n\n===Bridges===\nDue to nearby rivers, there are several major bridges in and around Zwolle. The most important bridge is the IJssel Bridge where the A28 motorway runs across. It was completed in 1970 and carries over 125.000 vehicles per day. Adjacent to this bridge is the older IJssel Bridge, which opened in 1930 and was destroyed twice during [[World War II]]. A third IJssel Bridge is the railway bridge (called Hanze boog) which carries the railway line from Zwolle to [[Amersfoort]], and from 2012, to [[Lelystad]]. There are several bridges across the [[Zwarte Water]] River, including two 4-lane bridges, a 2-lane bridge, and a bus/bicycle bridge. There is also a bridge across the [[Vecht (Overijssel)|Vecht]], which carries A28 motorway. Another local bridge is adjacent to this bridge. A third bridge carries rail traffic to [[Leeuwarden]] and [[Groningen (city)|Groningen]]. Numerous local bridges exist around the historic city center.\n\n===Rail transport===\n* [[Zwolle railway station]]\n\nThe first train in Zwolle arrived on June 6, 1864. Today the city has [[railroad|rail connections]] in eight directions (viz. [[Kampen, Overijssel|Kampen]], [[Leeuwarden]], [[Groningen (city)|Groningen]], [[Emmen, Netherlands|Emmen]], [[Enschede]], [[Arnhem]]/[[Nijmegen]], [[Lelystad]]/[[Amsterdam]], and [[Amersfoort]]).\n\nThe [[railroad|rail connection]] with [[Amsterdam]] via [[Lelystad]] \u2013 the [[Hanzelijn]] \u2013 is operational since December 2012.\n\nThe second station, [[Zwolle Stadshagen railway station|Zwolle Stadshagen]], was opened on 15 December 2019.\n\n===Water transport===\nZwolle is located on or near three [[river]]s ([[Zwarte Water]], [[Vecht (Overijssel)|Vecht]], and [[IJssel]]), several [[canal]]s (the now disused Willemsvaart, Nieuwe Vecht and Overijssels Kanaal and the modern Zwolle-IJssel Kanaal). There are some water-related industries in Zwolle, mainly in the Voorst industrial area.\n\n==International relations==\n{{Main article|List of twin towns and sister cities in the Netherlands}}\n\n===Twin towns\u2014sister cities===\nZwolle is currently [[town twinning|twinned]] with:\n* {{flagicon|Germany}} [[L\u00fcnen]], [[Germany]]\n\nIn the past, Zwolle had partnerships with{{cn|date=October 2017}}:\n* {{flagicon|Hungary}} [[\u00c9rsekhalma]], [[Hungary]]\n* {{flagicon|Rwanda}} [[Rutobwe]], [[Rwanda]]\n* {{flagicon|Russia}} [[Vologda]], [[Russia]]\n* {{flagicon|Russia}} [[Kaliningrad]], [[Russia]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n===Literature===\n*{{cite book |last1=Lourens |first1=Piet |last2=Lucassen |first2=Jan |title=Inwonertallen van Nederlandse steden ca. 1300\u20131800 |year=1997 |place=Amsterdam |publisher=NEHA |isbn=9057420082 |ref=harv }}\n\n==External links==\n{{Wikisource1911Enc|Zwolle}}\n*{{commons category-inline|Zwolle}}\n*{{wikivoyage-inline|Zwolle}}\n*[http://www.zwolle.nl Official website]\n\n<!--Please note that not all directions need to be filled-->\n<!--Please note that preferably only neighboring municipalities or bodies of water should be used-->\n{{Geographic location\n|Centre    = Zwolle\n|North     = [[Zwartewaterland]]\n|Northeast = [[Staphorst]]\n|East      = [[Dalfsen]]\n|Southeast = [[Raalte]]\n|South     = [[Heerde]]{{space}}([[Gelderland|GE]]), [[Olst-Wijhe]]\n|Southwest = [[Hattem]]{{space}}([[Gelderland|GE]])\n|West      = [[Kampen, Overijssel|Kampen]]\n}}\n\n{{Hanseatic League}}\n{{Overijssel Province}}\n{{Dutch capital cities}}\n{{Dutch municipality Zwolle}}\n\n{{Authority control}}\n\n[[Category:Zwolle| ]]\n[[Category:Cities in the Netherlands]]\n[[Category:Members of the Hanseatic League]]\n[[Category:Municipalities of Overijssel]]\n[[Category:Populated places in Overijssel]]\n[[Category:Provincial capitals of the Netherlands]]\n[[Category:Salland]]\n", "name_user": "Shadowssettle", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eEducational institutions:ln to deorphanise", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zwolle"}
