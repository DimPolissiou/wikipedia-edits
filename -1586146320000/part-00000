Played on a [[Billiard table|pool table]] with six [[Pocket (billiards)|pockets]], the game is so universally known in some countries that beginners are often unaware of other pool games and believe the word \"pool\" itself refers to eight-ball.<ref>{{Citation|title=8 Ball Pool Challenge I Game Challenge I Full Game|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aAe_P-nrNTs|language=en|access-date=2020-04-06}}</ref> The game has numerous variations, mostly regional.

The object balls include seven striped balls, seven solid-colored balls and the black 8 ball. After the balls are scattered with a {{Cuegloss|Break|break shot}}, a player is assigned either the group of solid or striped balls once they have legally pocketed a ball from that group. The ultimate object of the game is to legally pocket the eight ball in a \"called\" pocket, which can only be done after all of the balls from a player's assigned group have been cleared from the table. The 8-ball must never touch another ball before going into the pocket.\n\n==History==\nThe game of eight-ball is derived from an earlier game invented around 1900 (first recorded in 1908) in the United States and initially popularized under the name \"B.B.C. Co. Pool\" (a name that was still in use as late as 1925) by the [[Brunswick Corporation|Brunswick-Balke-Collender Company]]. This forerunner game was played with seven {{Cuegloss|Yellow ball|yellow}} and seven {{Cuegloss|red ball}}s, a {{Cuegloss|black ball}}, and the cue ball. Today, numbered {{Cuegloss|stripes}} and {{Cuegloss|solids}} are preferred in most of the world, though the British-style offshoot, [[Blackball (pool)|blackball]], uses the traditional colors (as did early televised \"casino\" tournaments in the United States). The game had relatively simple rules compared to today and was not added (under any name) to an official rule book (i.e., one published by a national or international [[sport governing body]]) until 1940.<ref name=\"Shamos 1999\">{{Shamos 1999}}</ref>{{rp|24, 89\u201390}}<ref name=\"Jewett 2002\">{{cite journal\n| last = Jewett\n| first = Bob\n|date=February 2002\n| title = 8-Ball Rules: The Many Different Versions of One of Today's Most Common Games\n| journal = Billiards Digest Magazine\n| pages = 22\u201323}}</ref><ref name=\"Hickock 2001\">{{Cite web|first=Ralph |last=Hickok |year=2001 |url=http://www.hickoksports.com/history/billiard.shtml |title=Sports History: Pocket Billiards |accessdate=2006-12-13 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061205013523/http://www.hickoksports.com/history/billiard.shtml |archivedate=5 December 2006 }}</ref><ref name=\"BCA 2005\">{{Cite web|publisher=Billiard Congress America |date=1995\u20132005 |url=http://www.bca-pool.com/aboutus/history/start.shtml |title=A Brief History of the Noble Game of Billiards |first=Mike |last=Shamos |accessdate=2006-12-13 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070127151057/http://www.bca-pool.com/aboutus/history/start.shtml |archivedate=27 January 2007 }}</ref>\n\n==Standardized rules of play==\n<!--DO NOT ADD BAR-POOL RULES TO THIS SECTION!-->\nAmerican-style eight-ball rules are played around the world by professionals, and in many amateur leagues. Nevertheless, the rules for eight-ball may be the most contested of any billiard game. There are several competing sets of \"official\" rules. The non-profit [[World Pool-Billiard Association]] (WPA) \u2013 with national affiliates around the world, some of which long pre-date the WPA, such as the [[Billiard Congress of America]] (BCA) \u2013 promulgates standardized rules as ''Pool Billiards \u2013 The Rules of Play''<ref name=\"WPARules\">{{cite book |title=Pool Billiards \u2013 The Rules of Play |url=http://www.wpa-pool.com/pdf/web/WPA_Rules.pdf|date=1 January 2008 |publisher=[[World Pool-Billiard Association]] |accessdate=21 March 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111119194935/http://wpa-pool.com/pdf/web/WPA_Rules.pdf |archive-date=19 November 2011 |url-status=dead }}</ref> for amateur and professional play.\n\nMeanwhile, many amateur leagues \u2013 such as the [[American Poolplayers Association]] (APA) / Canadian Poolplayers Association (CPA), the [[Valley National Eight-ball Association]] (VNEA, international in scope despite its historic name) and the [[BCA Pool League]] (BCAPL) \u2013 use their own rulesets; most of these are at least loosely based on the WPA/BCA version. Millions of individuals play informally, using informal house rules which vary not only from area to area but even from venue to venue (\"[[house rule]]s\").\n<!--DO NOT ADD BAR-POOL RULES TO THIS SECTION!-->\n\n===Equipment===\n<!--DO NOT ADD BAR-POOL RULES TO THIS SECTION!-->\nThe regulation size of the table's playing surface is {{Convert|9|by|4.5|ft|m|abbr=on}}, though exact dimensions may vary slightly by manufacturer. Some leagues and tournaments using the World Standardized Rules may allow smaller sizes, down to {{Convert|7|by|3.5|ft|m|abbr=on}}. Early 20th-century {{Convert|10|by|5|ft|m|abbr=on}} models are occasionally also still used. WPA professional competition generally employs regulation tables, while the amateur league championships of various leagues, including ACS, BCAPL, VNEA, and APA, use the seven-foot tables in order to fit more of them into the hosting venue.\n\nThere are seven {{cuegloss|solids|solid-colored balls}} numbered 1 through 7, seven {{cuegloss|stripes|striped balls}} numbered 9 through 15, an {{cuegloss|8 ball}}, and a {{cuegloss|cue ball}}. The balls are usually colored as follows:\n*1 and 9: yellow\n*2 and 10: blue\n*3 and 11: red\n*4 and 12: purple (TV: pink)<sup>1</sup>\n*5 and 13: orange\n*6 and 14: green\n*7 and 15: maroon (TV: tan)<sup>1</sup>\n*8: black\n*Cue: white\n:<sup>1</sup>Special sets designed to be more easily discernible on television substitute a rather light tan shade for the normally darker brown of the 7 and 15 balls, and pink for the dark purple of the 4 and 12; these alternative-color sets are now also available to consumers.\n<!--DO NOT ADD BAR-POOL RULES TO THIS SECTION!-->\n\n===Setup===\n<!--DO NOT ADD BAR-POOL RULES TO THIS SECTION!-->\nTo start the game, the {{Cuegloss|object ball}}s are placed in a triangular [[Rack (billiards)|rack]]. The base of the rack is parallel to the {{Cuegloss|end rail}} (the short end of the pool table) and positioned so the apex ball of the rack is located on the {{Cuegloss|foot spot}}. The balls in the rack are ideally placed so that they are all in contact with one another; this is accomplished by pressing the balls together toward the apex ball. The order of the balls should be random, with the exceptions of the 8 ball, which must be placed in the center of the rack (i.e., the middle of the third row), and the two back corner balls, one of which must be a stripe and the other a solid.<!--Do NOT change that. This is a standardized rule in all major leagues. No one cares whether your bar-pool rules want the 1 ball in the front and solids on the corners.--> The cue ball is placed anywhere the breaker desires behind the {{Cuegloss|head string}}. \n<!--DO NOT ADD BAR-POOL RULES TO THIS SECTION!-->\n\n===Break===\n<!--DO NOT ADD BAR-POOL RULES TO THIS SECTION!-->\nOne person is chosen by some predetermined method (e.g., [[coin toss]], {{Cuegloss|lag}}, or win or loss of previous game or match) to shoot first, using the cue ball to {{Cuegloss|break}} the object-ball rack apart. In most leagues it is the breaker's opponent who racks the balls, but in some, players break their own racks. If the breaker fails to make a successful break\u2014usually defined as at least four balls hitting cushions or an object ball being pocketed\u2014then the opponent can opt either to play from the current position or to call for a {{Cuegloss|re-rack}} and either re-break or have the original breaker repeat the break.\n[[File:8 ball break time lapse.jpg|right|thumb|300px|[[Long-exposure photography|Long-exposure photograph]] of a break in eight-ball]]\n\nIf the 8 ball is pocketed on the break, then the breaker can choose either to {{cuegloss|re-spot}} the 8 ball and play from the current position or to re-rack and re-break; but if the cue ball is also pocketed on the break then the opponent is the one who has the choice: either to re-spot the 8 ball and shoot with {{Cuegloss|ball-in-hand}} behind the {{Cuegloss|head string}}, accepting the current position, or to re-break or have the breaker re-break. {{crossref|printworthy=y|(For regional amateur variations, such as pocketing the 8 ball on the break resulting in instant win or loss, see [[#Informal rule variations by country|\"Informal rule variations\", below]].)}}\n<!--DO NOT ADD BAR-POOL RULES TO THIS SECTION!-->\n\n===Turn-taking===\n<!--DO NOT ADD BAR-POOL RULES TO THIS SECTION!-->\nA player (or team) continues to shoot until committing a {{Cuegloss|foul}} or failing to legally pocket an object ball (whether {{Cuegloss|Safety|intentionally}} or not); thereupon it is the turn of the opposing players. Play alternates in this manner for the remainder of the game. Following a foul, the incoming player has {{Cuegloss|ball-in-hand}} anywhere on the table, unless the foul occurred on the break shot, as noted previously.<ref name=\"WPARules\" />\n<!--DO NOT ADD BAR-POOL RULES TO THIS SECTION!-->\n\n===Selection of the target group===\nThe table is \"open\" at the start of the game, meaning that either player may shoot at any ball. It remains open until one player legally pockets one or more object balls (excluding the 8) after the break. That player is assigned the ''group'', or ''suit'', of the pocketed ball \u2013 1\u20137 (solids), or 9\u201315 (stripes) \u2013 and the other suit is assigned to the opponent. Balls pocketed on the break, or as the result of a foul while the table is still open, are not used to assign the suits. If a player pockets balls from both suits on an open table, they may claim either suit as their own.\n\nOnce the suits are assigned, they remain fixed throughout the game. If any balls from a player's suit are on the table, the player must hit one of them first on every shot; otherwise a foul is called and the turn ends. After all balls from the suit have been pocketed, the player's target becomes the 8 for the remainder of the game.\n\n===Pocketing the 8 ball===\n<!--DO NOT ADD BAR-POOL RULES TO THIS SECTION!-->\nOnce all of a player's (or team's) group of object balls are pocketed, the player attempts to sink the 8 ball. In order to win the game the player first designates which pocket the 8 ball will be pocketed into and then successfully pockets the 8 ball into that pocket. If the player knocks the 8 ball off the table then the player loses the game. If the player pockets the 8 ball and commits a foul or pockets it into another pocket than the one designated, then the player loses the game. ''(For regional amateur variations, such as fouling while trying to pocket the 8 ball resulting in instant loss despite not pocketing the 8 ball, see [[#Informal rule variations|\"Informal rule variations\"]], below.)'' Otherwise (i.e., if the 8 ball is neither pocketed nor knocked off the table) the shooter's turn is simply over, even if a foul occurs. In short, a World Standardized Rules game of eight-ball, like a game of nine-ball, is not over until the \"{{Cuegloss|money ball}}\" is no longer on the table. This rule may be unfamiliar to some bar and league (e.g., [[American Poolplayers Association|APA]]) players, for whom such a foul normally means losing the game. The rule has been increasingly adopted by amateur leagues, including [[Valley National 8-Ball League Association|VNEA]] beginning with the {{sic|hide=y|2008/2009}} season, [[BCA Pool League|BCAPL]], and [[USA Pool League|USAPL]].\n<!--DO NOT ADD BAR-POOL RULES TO THIS SECTION!-->\n\n===Winning===\n<!--DO NOT ADD BAR-POOL RULES TO THIS SECTION!-->\nAny of the following results in a player winning the game:\n*The player legally pockets the 8 ball into a designated pocket, after all of that player's object balls have been pocketed\n*The opposing player illegally pockets the 8 ball (e.g., before clearing all of that player's object balls, does so on the same shot as the last such object ball, or sinks the 8 ball into a pocket other than the one that was designated, or commits any foul, including scratching the cue ball into a pocket or knocking it off the table, while pocketing the 8 ball)\n**However, if you scratch after sinking your final designated ball (stripe or solid), you do not lose immediately.\n*The opposing player knocks the 8 ball off the table\nBecause of these rules, it's actually possible for a game to end with only one of the players having shot.\n<!--DO NOT ADD BAR-POOL RULES TO THIS SECTION!-->\n\n===Fouls===\n<!--DO NOT ADD BAR-POOL RULES TO THIS SECTION!-->\n*The shooter fails to strike one of their own object balls (or the 8 ball, if all of said object balls are already pocketed) with the cue ball, before other balls (if any) are contacted by the cue ball.

If at least 1000 serious\n        players do not regularly use the rules you wish to mention here,\n        then they should not be mentioned here, even if you can cite a \n        local, self-published rule-sheet for them.\n*******************************************************************************************-->\n\n===Canada===\nIn Canada there are similar levels and types of variation as in the US ''(see [[#United States|below]])''. One particularly common feature of Canadian bar pool is the \"hooked yourself on the eight\" rule, failure to hit the 8 ball when one is shooting for the 8 is a loss of game {{em|unless}} one was hooked ({{Cuegloss|snooker}}ed) by one's opponent. Even then, if {{Cuegloss|Called pocket|a pocket is called}} for the 8 ball, as opposed to \"just a shot\" (i.e., a {{Cuegloss|safety}}), failure to hit the 8 ball is an instant loss. Pocketing an opponent's {{Cuegloss|object ball}} while shooting for the 8, even if the shot was otherwise legal, is also a game-loser often even in local league play. It is also an automatic loss if a player {{cuegloss|scratch}}es while shooting for the 8 regardless of whether the eight ball is pocketed or not. \"{{Cuegloss|Split}}\" shots, where the {{Cuegloss|cue ball}} appears to simultaneously strike a legal and an opponent's object balls, are generally considered legal shots in informal games, as long as they are called as split shots, and the hit is in fact simultaneous to the human eye. A further Canadian bar-pool rule is that a shot is a {{Cuegloss|visit}}-ending (but not {{Cuegloss|ball-in-hand}}) foul if one pockets one's called shot but also pockets another ball incidentally, even if it is one's own (however, if that secondary pocketing was also called, the shot is legal, regardless of the order in which the balls were dropped). Finally, it is also a visit-ending foul if the cue ball touches any ball that is ultimately pocketed more than once on the same shot (this is colloquially known as a \"double kiss\"), even if the player called for the ball to enter that particular pocket on the shot.\nThe last black ball has just three chances to select pocket position.\n\n===India===\nIf a scratch or other foul occurs while playing the 8 ball, as long as the opponent has at least one ball of his or her group present on the table and the 8 ball is not pocketed, the game continues. In both cases of this foul-on-the-8 situation, the opponent gets two chances (regardless of whether any balls are potted on the first chance) before the fouling player may shoot again. In these circumstances, treatment of the cue ball depends on the type of foul. If the cue ball had been scratched, the cue ball must be placed behind the break line.{{clarify|date=July 2015|reason=On both tries, or just the first one?}} If it was some other foul which had occurred while playing the 8 ball, the cue ball is not moved. If the incoming opponent scratches,{{clarify|date=July 2015|reason=Does a scratch by the incoming opponent on EITHER turn give two turns to original shooter, or only if the scratch was on the 2nd one? What about non-scratch fouls? Does a foul on the first attempt just lead to the second attempt, or does the original player now get two chances? Does a foul on the 2nd attempt lead to two changes for the original shooter, or just end the incoming opponent's turn?}} the player who originally fouled now receives two chances. When the 8 ball is the only ball on the table, any kind of foul ends the game, and the opponent of the fouling player wins.\n\n=== Latin America ===\n\nThe {{Cuegloss|rack}}ed balls are often loose, crooked or not exactly on the {{Cuegloss|foot spot}} (it is not considered to matter), and the [[Rack (billiards)|rack]] itself may be made of rubber, and flexible, making a tight rack physically impossible to achieve. Other than the 8 ball, other balls may be placed far more randomly than players in other areas would tolerate, with large clusters of solids together, and stripes with each other.\n\nIn most of [[Latin America]], including Mexico, shots are un-{{Cuegloss|call}}ed, as in British pool (i.e., {{Cuegloss|slop}} shots count, a concept foreign to most American players other than [[American Poolplayers Association|APA]] league members). In many if not most areas (Brazil being an exception), fouls result in {{Cuegloss|ball-in-hand}} behind the {{Cuegloss|head string}} only, as in American bar pool (allowing for intentional scratches that leave the opponent a very difficult shot if all opponent balls are \"in the {{Cuegloss|kitchen}}\", behind the headstring).\n\nA common Latin American variant of \"{{Cuegloss|last-pocket}}\" is that each player is allowed either one (or even two) cue-ball scratches when shooting for the 8, which {{em|must}} be pocketed in the same pocket as the shooter's final object ball. Such fouls simply end the shooter's turn at the table and give the opponent ball-in-hand behind the head string; only the second (or third, respectively) such scratch is a loss of game (though scratching the 8 ball itself off the table or into the wrong pocket is an instant loss). This version is common even in US pool bars that are frequented by recent [[Latinos|Latino]] immigrants. This requirement has a profound effect upon game strategy \u2013 it is effectively 5 times harder to {{Cuegloss|run out}} \u2013 and most North American (and British, etc.) players are completely unprepared for it, unless they are last-pocket players. Players must be very mindful what they do with their last few balls, and common failure to get {{Cuegloss|shape}} that allows for the last object-ball shot to set the player up for an easy 8 ball shot into the same pocket leads to long games with many {{Cuegloss|bank}}, {{Cuegloss|kick}} and {{Cuegloss|kiss}} shots on the 8.\n\nIn some parts of Latin America, especially South America, the 1 ball often must be pocketed in the side pocket on the right-hand side of the table (relative to the end of the table one breaks from), and the 15 ball must be pocketed in the left side pocket. This rule probably developed to make it harder to run out after the first shot. Position play takes a larger role in this variation, and a player's strategy must necessarily initially revolve around getting the 1 or 15 in while preventing this opponent from doing likewise. When racking the balls for this variation, the 1 and 15 balls are placed behind the 8 ball at the center of the rack, the 1 ball on the left and the 15 ball on the right (from the {{em|racker's}} perspective). Latino last-pocket is virtually the only version of eight-ball played in Mexico, other than in the [[Mexico\u2013United States border]] area.<!-- Is there a name for this variation? --> Another variant in Latin America is that the only ball-in-hand (behind the head string) foul is {{Cuegloss|scratch}}ing the cue ball into a pocket; other fouls are simply loss-of-turn.\n\nIn Mexico, a minority of players rack with the 8 ball rather than the apex ball on the foot spot, a trait in common with British-style [[Blackball (pool)|blackball/8-ball pool]]. Pocketing the 8 ball on the {{Cuegloss|break}} shot is an instant win, as it usually is in American bar pool, but is not in the international rules. Because Mexican pool, except near the US border, is almost always played on open-pocket [[Billiard hall|pool-hall]]-style tables, rather than coin-operated tables that trap object balls, any of one's own balls pocketed on a foul are {{Cuegloss|spot}}ted (but how they are spotted varies widely, with the balls often placed against the {{Cuegloss|foot cushion}} on the {{Cuegloss|center string}}, and adjacent to nearby {{Cuegloss|diamonds}} if more than one must be spotted, instead of on the foot spot, but sometimes even to the {{em|side}} at {{Cuegloss|long rail}} diamonds, due to the influence of [[Coyote (pool)|coyote]], a Mexican variant of [[Chicago (pool)|Chicago]]; foot-spot spotting is neither common nor uncommon.) Pool itself is not considered a very serious game in the country other than in the northern [[States of Mexico|states]]; in most of Mexico, [[three-cushion billiards]] is the serious game, while pool is mostly played by youths, by groups of friends (including many young women) as a bar game to pass the time, and by older working-class men as an after-work activity. In many recreation halls, [[dominoes]] is more popular than pool. In Mexico, there is a legend of a pool player called El Motore. Nobody knows his real identity, only legends of him pocketing all the balls blind folded 20 times in a row.\n\nIn many bars in Brazil (and not an official rule), a foul is generally punished by pocketing the lowest-numbered ball of the opponent. In that case, the cue ball remains where it stopped, as ball-in-hand is not commonly used. Additionally, in the case of scratching the cue ball, the opponent places the cue ball in the {{Cuegloss|kitchen}}, on the {{Cuegloss|head spot}}, or most commonly anywhere inside {{Cuegloss|\"D\", the|the \"D\"}}, indicating some British [[snooker]] or [[Blackball (pool)|blackball]] influence.\n\n===New Zealand===\n{{Unreferenced section|date=March 2011|reason=This section may be original research or local stuff; the NZ pool film \"Stickmen\" seems to contradict most or all of this.}}\nNew Zealand eight-ball in many respects is closer to British [[Blackball (pool)|blackball]], but with numbered balls being used. {{Cuegloss|\"D\", the|A \"D\"}} is typically drawn on the table above the {{cuegloss|baulk line}}<!--Does it coincide with the headstring, by running from diamond to diamond, or it is a bit closer to the bottom [head] rail, proportionally, like in snooker?--> (as on a snooker table) and the shooting player is required to place the cue ball within it on the {{cuegloss|break-off}} and after an opponent {{cuegloss|Scratch|scratches}}. The shooting player can shoot the ball in any direction from within the \"D\". If no \"D\" is drawn on the table then the \"forward play\" rule is followed: After a scratch, the player with ball-in-hand must shoot forward of the baulk line (i.e., towards the rack area, even if all legal balls are behind the baulk line). The \"{{Cuegloss|Two shots|two-shot rule}}\" of blackball may or may not be followed; this depends on individual players and pubs.\n\nThe \"nomination\" rule is unique to New Zealand: A player {{Cuegloss|snooker}}ed on the 8 ball may nominate one of the opponent's balls (if any remain) to hit as an alternative, legal \"{{cuegloss|ball on}}\". However, the shooter is not permitted to pot (pocket) such a nominated ball \u2013 doing so results in a loss of game.\n\n===North Africa===\nIn North African countries (as in Latin America, but reversed), both the 1 and 15 balls must be pocketed in the sides, the 15 on the right and 1 on the left (relative to the end of the table one breaks from). The North African version of the informal game is always played \"{{Cuegloss|last-pocket}}\". {{Cuegloss|Ball-in-hand}} is not taken on fouls, and \"{{Cuegloss|bank-the-8}}\" is a very common rule in addition to last-pocket.\n\n=== Pakistan ===\nDuring game play, if the player fails to hit a ball of the designated group, or hits the opponent's ball with the cue ball, then the opponent receives 2 shots unless the opponent has pocketed all his or her balls and only the 8 ball remains, in which case the opponent will only get one shot. In case of such a foul, the game continues with the player playing the cue ball at the place where it stopped. If a scratch occurs, then the opponent plays ball-in-hand, but is only allowed to place it anywhere in the D. However, that player may shoot the cue ball in any direction. Knocking a ball (apart from the cue ball) off the table carries no penalty. Instead, the misplaced ball is returned to its original place and the game continues. Player should call the pocket for the 8th ball and the shot should be clean such as there is no kisses, caroms or combinations unless it is agreed prior to the game.\n\n===United Kingdom and Ireland===\n{{Expand section|date=August 2008}}<!--There are almost certainly actual eight-ball as opposed to 8-ball pool/blackball rules in the UK and Ireland that need to be documented here.-->\n{{further|Blackball (pool)}}\nPool is popularly played in two forms. Traditionally it is played with smaller balls than the internationally standardized version, on a 4.5 by 7-foot [[Public house|pub]]-sized table, with differently shaped, smaller pockets. The {{cuegloss|cue ball}} is also slightly smaller than the {{cuegloss|object balls}}. \"American-style\" pool tables are also common in the UK, especially for [[nine-ball]] competition; the tables themselves are often referred to as \"nine-ball tables\", with that game being played only rarely on the more common, smaller traditional British-style tables. The two most common competitive rule sets used on the traditional tables are WEPF world {{sic|hide=y|eightball pool}} rules<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.epa.org.uk/wrules.php|title=ENGLISH POOL ASSOCIATION|accessdate=13 December 2015}}</ref> (replacing old EPA rules),<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.epa.org.uk/rules.php|title=ENGLISH POOL ASSOCIATION|accessdate=13 December 2015}}</ref> and WPA world-standardized blackball rules.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wpa-pool.com/web/index.asp?id=117&pagetype=rules|title=World Pool-Billiard Association \u2013 9 Ball Rules|accessdate=13 December 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151205092931/http://www.wpa-pool.com/web/index.asp?id=117&pagetype=rules|archive-date=5 December 2015|url-status=dead}}</ref> Most amateurs play \"pub rules\", meaning the local rule variation established at that venue.\n\nUnlike the American variation of Spots and Stripes, British Pool is primarily played using two sets of colours, reds and yellows along with the standard black 8-ball and white cueball. These balls are two inches in diameter with the cue ball being either the same size or slightly smaller at one inch and 7/8, Aramith are the most popular brand of Pool balls used in Great Britain. English Pool is most often played using both sets of standardized competitive rule sets have features to which some amateur pub players object. As one example, WEPF rules permit intentional fouls. Despite opponents being awarded two visits for a standard foul in pub pool, for one to cause an intentional foul or to not try to play a legal shot is seen as unsportsmanlike (as it is in pub/bar pool in the US and many other places). As another example, in WPA rules, rather than {{cuegloss|two-shot carry|getting two independent visits}} after a foul, the incoming player gets one {{cuegloss|Free ball|free shot}} and then play returns to normal. As most pub rules are based around old EPA rules, in which two visits are awarded (rather than a free shot) amateurs are often unhappy with this difference in blackball, although it is in no way as offensive as intentional fouls which are illegal in blackball and result in {{em|loss of frame}}.\n\nNot all differences are controversial. Both WEPF and WPA require a player to either pot on their visit, or drive any ball, including the white, into a cushion after hitting a legal object ball, or else they give a foul. Although the precise specifics of the rule are a mouthful, many amateur players find it acceptable. It is intended primarily as a way to prevent \"tucking up\", whereby a player does not attempt to pot and instead just rolls up to their object ball to use it to snooker their opponent; tucking up is seen as unsporting, so being forced to play harder shots is quite welcomed.\n\nThere are several sets of rules which use a combination of many others in an attempt to find a balance between WPA rules, which are seen as more aggressive, and WEPF rules which are often referred to, pejoratively, as \"chess\" because of the amount of {{cuegloss|safety}} play they encourage, which can drag a game out.\n\n===United States===\n{{More citations needed section|date=August 2008}}\n[[File:PoolPlayers.jpg|thumb|300px|American players at a bar in New York (2006)]]\nMost commonly of all in American {{Cuegloss|bar pool}} \u2013 sometimes called '''straight eight''' by its aficionados, and usually played on coin-operated, smaller tables \u2013 a requirement may be that all shots be {{cuegloss|Call-shot|called}} {{em|in detail}}. This typically includes what balls and bank/kick cushions will be involved in the shot, and in what order. The shot considered a turn-ending (but not ball-in-hand) foul if not executed precisely as planned, but a loss of game if the \"foul\" shot pocketed the 8 ball.<ref>See for example: {{Cite web\n|url=http://www.pool-billiards-game.com/billiard-rules.html\n|title=Billiard Rules? Bar Rules, League Rules, Which Rules Are Straight Eight?\n|first=Ted\n|last=Mauro\n|work=Pool-Billiards-Game.com\n|location=[[Pueblo, Colorado]]\n|publisher=self-published\n|year=2007\n|accessdate=2009-06-13\n}} Many other blogs and offline personal writings can confirm this author's take on the matter, but little authoritative has been written on the subject, as \"bar pool\" is of little consequence in the world of organized pool.</ref> Contrariwise, some Americans hold that nothing other than the 8 ball has to be called in any way (i.e., that \"{{cuegloss|slop}}\" counts).\n\nIn informal amateur play in most areas, the table will only be considered open if no balls were pocketed, or an equal number of stripes and solids were pocketed, or the cue ball was {{cuegloss|scratch}}ed (into a pocket or off the table), on the {{cuegloss|break}}; if an odd number of balls were legally pocketed, such as one solid and two stripes, or no solids and one stripe, the breaker must shoot the balls that were pocketed in the greatest quantity (stripes in these examples). The table is almost never considered so {{cuegloss|open}} as for it to be legal to use a ball of the opposite {{cuegloss|suit}}, much less the 8 ball, as the first ball in a combination shot while the table is open (despite this being perfectly legal in WPA World Standardized and many US league rules). In non-{{cuegloss|money games}} it is fairly common for a foul break in which the rack was not struck at all (e.g., due to a {{cuegloss|miscue}}) to be re-shot by the original breaker.\n\nFouls, in common bar pool, that are not cue-ball scratches generally only cause loss of turn, with cue ball left in place (even if it is {{cuegloss|hook}}ed). Even in the case of a scratch, this only results in {{cuegloss|ball-in-hand}} {{em|behind the {{cuegloss|head string}}}}. Regionally, there is a great deal of bar pool variation in the handling of fouls while shooting at or pocketing the 8 ball. In some cases any foul while shooting at but not pocketing the 8 is a loss of game, in others only a foul while otherwise successfully pocketing the 8, and in yet others only certain fouls, such as also sinking an opponent's ball and the 8 ball on the same shot, or hitting the 8 then cue-ball scratching, are game-losing.\n\nWhat is considered a foul further diverges from established, published rulesets. Scoop-under {{cuegloss|jump shot}}s are usually considered valid (these are fouls in WPA and most league rules, as they are {{cuegloss|double-hit}}s, though few players realize it). When a cue ball is frozen or near-frozen to an object ball, shooting it dead-on, in line with both balls, is a foul in most formal rulesets (as another kind of double-hit), but is generally tolerated in bar pool.\n\nOther US bar pool oddities varying from area to area include: Knocking the cue ball off the table on the break may be an instant loss; scratching on the break may be an instant loss; pocketing the 8 ball on the break (without scratching) may be either an instant win or instant loss (the latter being a rare variant); no safeties may be allowed at all \u2013 all shots may be required to be at least vaguely plausible attempts to pocket a legal ball; all jump shots may be banned; {{cuegloss|mass\u00e9}} shots may be banned; it may be illegal to use the 8 ball in any way in combinations, caroms, or kisses; the 8 ball may be required to be pocketed \"cleanly\" in the sense of no contact with other object balls (even if the {{cuegloss|kiss}} shot can be accurately called); failure to hit one of one's own object balls (or the 8 if shooting for the 8) may be considered a \"table scratch\" that gives the opponent a shot in-hand from behind the head string; failure to hit the 8 if shooting for the 8 may be a loss of game; and a \"split\" shot, where the cue ball appears to simultaneously strike a legal ball and an opponent's object ball, may be considered a legal shot, as long as it is called as a split shot, and the hit is simultaneous to the naked eye.\n\n\"{{Cuegloss|Bank-the-8}}\" is a common American amateur variation, especially on coin-operated {{Cuegloss|bar tables}} (because it usually makes the game last longer), in which the 8 ball must be {{Cuegloss|Bank shot|banked}} off one or more {{Cuegloss|cushions}} ({{Cuegloss|kick shot}}s may also qualify in some versions), into the {{Cuegloss|Call-pocket|called pocket}}; either player may suggest bank-the-eight at any time before or during the game, and the other may accept or refuse; all other rules apply as usual. Playing bank-the-eight may be considered rude if other players are waiting for a turn at the table.\n\nA similarly motivated variant is \"{{Cuegloss|last-pocket}}\", in which the 8 ball must be pocketed in the same pocket as the shooting player's last object ball (i.e., each player may be said to eventually \"own\" a pocket in which their 8 ball shot must be played if they have already run out their {{Cuegloss|suit}}); all other rules apply as usual. This variant is also popular in Mexico.\n\nDue probably to the influence of [[nine-ball]], in which the 1 ball ''must'' be the apex ball of the rack, most American bar players traditionally rack a game of eight-ball with the 1 ball in this position. Racking is also typically done solid-stripe-solid-stripe-solid along the two sides of the rack, resulting in solids being on all three corners. This is not a legal rack in World Standardized Rules, nor any other notable league ruleset other than [[American Poolplayers Association|APA]].\n\n<!-- *******************************************************************************************\n        Please do NOT add your school, local club, league, neighborhood\n        or even city variants.

As with American-style eight-ball, there are multiple competing standards bodies that have issued international rules. Aside from using unnumbered object balls (except for the 8), UK-style tables have pockets just larger than the balls. More than one type of {{Cuegloss|rest}} is typically used. Most tables do not have {{cuegloss|diamond}}s on the rails, and consequently the racking spot is on the {{cuegloss|baulk line}} not at the second-diamond {{cuegloss|headstring}}. The rules significantly differ in numerous ways, including the handling of fouls, which may give the opponent two shots, racking (the 8 ball, not the apex ball, goes on the spot), selection of which group of balls will be shot by which player, handling of {{Cuegloss|frozen}} balls and {{Cuegloss|snooker}}s, and many other details.\n\nThe English Pool Association<ref>[http://www.epa.org.uk/index.php English Pool Association]</ref> is recognized by the [[UK Sport|Sports Council]] as the governing body for pool including blackball in England.\n<!--DO NOT ADD PUB-POOL RULES TO THIS SECTION!-->\n\n===Eight-ball rotation===\n{{Details|Rotation (pool)}}\nThe hybrid game '''eight-ball rotation''' is a combination of eight-ball and [[Rotation (pool)|rotation]], in which the players must pocket their balls (other than the 8, which remains last) in numerical order. Specifically, the solids player starts by pocketing the 1 ball and ascends to the 7 ball, and the stripes player starts by pocketing the 15 ball and descends to the 9 ball.\n\n==See also==\n*[[List of World Eight-ball Champions]]\n\n==References==\n{{More citations needed|date=March 2009}}\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n\n<!--=========================({{NO JUNK LINKS}})===========================\n    | PLEASE BE CAUTIOUS IN ADDING MORE LINKS TO THIS ARTICLE.

Played on a [[Billiard table|pool table]] with six [[Pocket (billiards)|pockets]], the game is so universally known in some countries that beginners are often unaware of other pool games and believe the word \"pool\" itself refers to eight-ball.{{citation needed|date=December 2017}} The game has numerous variations, mostly regional. Standard eight-ball is the second most competitive professional pool game, after [[nine-ball]], and for the last several decades ahead of [[straight pool]].{{citation needed|date=December 2017}} Unlike [[nine-ball]], [[ten-ball]], or [[seven-ball]] where the game's name reflects the number of object balls used, eight-ball uses all fifteen object balls.\n\nEight-ball is played with [[cue stick]]s and sixteen [[Billiard balls|balls]]: a {{Cuegloss|cue ball}} and fifteen {{Cuegloss|object ball}}s.  The object balls include seven striped balls, seven solid-colored balls and the black 8 ball. After the balls are scattered with a {{Cuegloss|Break|break shot}}, a player is assigned either the group of solid or striped balls once they have legally pocketed a ball from that group. The ultimate object of the game is to legally pocket the eight ball in a \"called\" pocket, which can only be done after all of the balls from a player's assigned group have been cleared from the table. The 8-ball must never touch another ball before going into the pocket.\n\n==History==\nThe game of eight-ball is derived from an earlier game invented around 1900 (first recorded in 1908) in the United States and initially popularized under the name \"B.B.C. Co. Pool\" (a name that was still in use as late as 1925) by the [[Brunswick Corporation|Brunswick-Balke-Collender Company]]. This forerunner game was played with seven {{Cuegloss|Yellow ball|yellow}} and seven {{Cuegloss|red ball}}s, a {{Cuegloss|black ball}}, and the cue ball. Today, numbered {{Cuegloss|stripes}} and {{Cuegloss|solids}} are preferred in most of the world, though the British-style offshoot, [[Blackball (pool)|blackball]], uses the traditional colors (as did early televised \"casino\" tournaments in the United States). The game had relatively simple rules compared to today and was not added (under any name) to an official rule book (i.e., one published by a national or international [[sport governing body]]) until 1940.<ref name=\"Shamos 1999\">{{Shamos 1999}}</ref>{{rp|24, 89\u201390}}<ref name=\"Jewett 2002\">{{cite journal\n| last = Jewett\n| first = Bob\n|date=February 2002\n| title = 8-Ball Rules: The Many Different Versions of One of Today's Most Common Games\n| journal = Billiards Digest Magazine\n| pages = 22\u201323}}</ref><ref name=\"Hickock 2001\">{{Cite web|first=Ralph |last=Hickok |year=2001 |url=http://www.hickoksports.com/history/billiard.shtml |title=Sports History: Pocket Billiards |accessdate=2006-12-13 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061205013523/http://www.hickoksports.com/history/billiard.shtml |archivedate=5 December 2006 }}</ref><ref name=\"BCA 2005\">{{Cite web|publisher=Billiard Congress America |date=1995\u20132005 |url=http://www.bca-pool.com/aboutus/history/start.shtml |title=A Brief History of the Noble Game of Billiards |first=Mike |last=Shamos |accessdate=2006-12-13 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070127151057/http://www.bca-pool.com/aboutus/history/start.shtml |archivedate=27 January 2007 }}</ref>\n\n==Standardized rules of play==\n<!--DO NOT ADD BAR-POOL RULES TO THIS SECTION!-->\nAmerican-style eight-ball rules are played around the world by professionals, and in many amateur leagues. Nevertheless, the rules for eight-ball may be the most contested of any billiard game. There are several competing sets of \"official\" rules. The non-profit [[World Pool-Billiard Association]] (WPA) \u2013 with national affiliates around the world, some of which long pre-date the WPA, such as the [[Billiard Congress of America]] (BCA) \u2013 promulgates standardized rules as ''Pool Billiards \u2013 The Rules of Play''<ref name=\"WPARules\">{{cite book |title=Pool Billiards \u2013 The Rules of Play |url=http://www.wpa-pool.com/pdf/web/WPA_Rules.pdf|date=1 January 2008 |publisher=[[World Pool-Billiard Association]] |accessdate=21 March 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111119194935/http://wpa-pool.com/pdf/web/WPA_Rules.pdf |archive-date=19 November 2011 |url-status=dead }}</ref> for amateur and professional play.\n\nMeanwhile, many amateur leagues \u2013 such as the [[American Poolplayers Association]] (APA) / Canadian Poolplayers Association (CPA), the [[Valley National Eight-ball Association]] (VNEA, international in scope despite its historic name) and the [[BCA Pool League]] (BCAPL) \u2013 use their own rulesets; most of these are at least loosely based on the WPA/BCA version. Millions of individuals play informally, using informal house rules which vary not only from area to area but even from venue to venue (\"[[house rule]]s\").\n<!--DO NOT ADD BAR-POOL RULES TO THIS SECTION!-->\n\n===Equipment===\n<!--DO NOT ADD BAR-POOL RULES TO THIS SECTION!-->\nThe regulation size of the table's playing surface is {{Convert|9|by|4.5|ft|m|abbr=on}}, though exact dimensions may vary slightly by manufacturer. Some leagues and tournaments using the World Standardized Rules may allow smaller sizes, down to {{Convert|7|by|3.5|ft|m|abbr=on}}. Early 20th-century {{Convert|10|by|5|ft|m|abbr=on}} models are occasionally also still used. WPA professional competition generally employs regulation tables, while the amateur league championships of various leagues, including ACS, BCAPL, VNEA, and APA, use the seven-foot tables in order to fit more of them into the hosting venue.\n\nThere are seven {{cuegloss|solids|solid-colored balls}} numbered 1 through 7, seven {{cuegloss|stripes|striped balls}} numbered 9 through 15, an {{cuegloss|8 ball}}, and a {{cuegloss|cue ball}}. The balls are usually colored as follows:\n*1 and 9: yellow\n*2 and 10: blue\n*3 and 11: red\n*4 and 12: purple (TV: pink)<sup>1</sup>\n*5 and 13: orange\n*6 and 14: green\n*7 and 15: maroon (TV: tan)<sup>1</sup>\n*8: black\n*Cue: white\n:<sup>1</sup>Special sets designed to be more easily discernible on television substitute a rather light tan shade for the normally darker brown of the 7 and 15 balls, and pink for the dark purple of the 4 and 12; these alternative-color sets are now also available to consumers.\n<!--DO NOT ADD BAR-POOL RULES TO THIS SECTION!-->\n\n===Setup===\n<!--DO NOT ADD BAR-POOL RULES TO THIS SECTION!-->\nTo start the game, the {{Cuegloss|object ball}}s are placed in a triangular [[Rack (billiards)|rack]]. The base of the rack is parallel to the {{Cuegloss|end rail}} (the short end of the pool table) and positioned so the apex ball of the rack is located on the {{Cuegloss|foot spot}}. The balls in the rack are ideally placed so that they are all in contact with one another; this is accomplished by pressing the balls together toward the apex ball. The order of the balls should be random, with the exceptions of the 8 ball, which must be placed in the center of the rack (i.e., the middle of the third row), and the two back corner balls, one of which must be a stripe and the other a solid.<!--Do NOT change that. This is a standardized rule in all major leagues. No one cares whether your bar-pool rules want the 1 ball in the front and solids on the corners.--> The cue ball is placed anywhere the breaker desires behind the {{Cuegloss|head string}}. \n<!--DO NOT ADD BAR-POOL RULES TO THIS SECTION!-->\n\n===Break===\n<!--DO NOT ADD BAR-POOL RULES TO THIS SECTION!-->\nOne person is chosen by some predetermined method (e.g., [[coin toss]], {{Cuegloss|lag}}, or win or loss of previous game or match) to shoot first, using the cue ball to {{Cuegloss|break}} the object-ball rack apart. In most leagues it is the breaker's opponent who racks the balls, but in some, players break their own racks. If the breaker fails to make a successful break\u2014usually defined as at least four balls hitting cushions or an object ball being pocketed\u2014then the opponent can opt either to play from the current position or to call for a {{Cuegloss|re-rack}} and either re-break or have the original breaker repeat the break.\n[[File:8 ball break time lapse.jpg|right|thumb|300px|[[Long-exposure photography|Long-exposure photograph]] of a break in eight-ball]]\n\nIf the 8 ball is pocketed on the break, then the breaker can choose either to {{cuegloss|re-spot}} the 8 ball and play from the current position or to re-rack and re-break; but if the cue ball is also pocketed on the break then the opponent is the one who has the choice: either to re-spot the 8 ball and shoot with {{Cuegloss|ball-in-hand}} behind the {{Cuegloss|head string}}, accepting the current position, or to re-break or have the breaker re-break. {{crossref|printworthy=y|(For regional amateur variations, such as pocketing the 8 ball on the break resulting in instant win or loss, see [[#Informal rule variations by country|\"Informal rule variations\", below]].)}}\n<!--DO NOT ADD BAR-POOL RULES TO THIS SECTION!-->\n\n===Turn-taking===\n<!--DO NOT ADD BAR-POOL RULES TO THIS SECTION!-->\nA player (or team) continues to shoot until committing a {{Cuegloss|foul}} or failing to legally pocket an object ball (whether {{Cuegloss|Safety|intentionally}} or not); thereupon it is the turn of the opposing players. Play alternates in this manner for the remainder of the game. Following a foul, the incoming player has {{Cuegloss|ball-in-hand}} anywhere on the table, unless the foul occurred on the break shot, as noted previously.<ref name=\"WPARules\" />\n<!--DO NOT ADD BAR-POOL RULES TO THIS SECTION!-->\n\n===Selection of the target group===\nThe table is \"open\" at the start of the game, meaning that either player may shoot at any ball. It remains open until one player legally pockets one or more object balls (excluding the 8) after the break. That player is assigned the ''group'', or ''suit'', of the pocketed ball \u2013 1\u20137 (solids), or 9\u201315 (stripes) \u2013 and the other suit is assigned to the opponent. Balls pocketed on the break, or as the result of a foul while the table is still open, are not used to assign the suits. If a player pockets balls from both suits on an open table, they may claim either suit as their own.\n\nOnce the suits are assigned, they remain fixed throughout the game. If any balls from a player's suit are on the table, the player must hit one of them first on every shot; otherwise a foul is called and the turn ends. After all balls from the suit have been pocketed, the player's target becomes the 8 for the remainder of the game.\n\n===Pocketing the 8 ball===\n<!--DO NOT ADD BAR-POOL RULES TO THIS SECTION!-->\nOnce all of a player's (or team's) group of object balls are pocketed, the player attempts to sink the 8 ball. In order to win the game the player first designates which pocket the 8 ball will be pocketed into and then successfully pockets the 8 ball into that pocket. If the player knocks the 8 ball off the table then the player loses the game. If the player pockets the 8 ball and commits a foul or pockets it into another pocket than the one designated, then the player loses the game. ''(For regional amateur variations, such as fouling while trying to pocket the 8 ball resulting in instant loss despite not pocketing the 8 ball, see [[#Informal rule variations|\"Informal rule variations\"]], below.)'' Otherwise (i.e., if the 8 ball is neither pocketed nor knocked off the table) the shooter's turn is simply over, even if a foul occurs. In short, a World Standardized Rules game of eight-ball, like a game of nine-ball, is not over until the \"{{Cuegloss|money ball}}\" is no longer on the table.

One particularly common feature of Canadian bar pool is the \"hooked yourself on the eight\" rule, failure to hit the 8 ball when one is shooting for the 8 is a loss of game {{em|unless}} one was hooked ({{Cuegloss|snooker}}ed) by one's opponent. Even then, if {{Cuegloss|Called pocket|a pocket is called}} for the 8 ball, as opposed to \"just a shot\" (i.e., a {{Cuegloss|safety}}), failure to hit the 8 ball is an instant loss. Pocketing an opponent's {{Cuegloss|object ball}} while shooting for the 8, even if the shot was otherwise legal, is also a game-loser often even in local league play. It is also an automatic loss if a player {{cuegloss|scratch}}es while shooting for the 8 regardless of whether the eight ball is pocketed or not. \"{{Cuegloss|Split}}\" shots, where the {{Cuegloss|cue ball}} appears to simultaneously strike a legal and an opponent's object balls, are generally considered legal shots in informal games, as long as they are called as split shots, and the hit is in fact simultaneous to the human eye. A further Canadian bar-pool rule is that a shot is a {{Cuegloss|visit}}-ending (but not {{Cuegloss|ball-in-hand}}) foul if one pockets one's called shot but also pockets another ball incidentally, even if it is one's own (however, if that secondary pocketing was also called, the shot is legal, regardless of the order in which the balls were dropped). Finally, it is also a visit-ending foul if the cue ball touches any ball that is ultimately pocketed more than once on the same shot (this is colloquially known as a \"double kiss\"), even if the player called for the ball to enter that particular pocket on the shot.\nThe last black ball has just three chances to select pocket position.\n\n===India===\nIf a scratch or other foul occurs while playing the 8 ball, as long as the opponent has at least one ball of his or her group present on the table and the 8 ball is not pocketed, the game continues. In both cases of this foul-on-the-8 situation, the opponent gets two chances (regardless of whether any balls are potted on the first chance) before the fouling player may shoot again. In these circumstances, treatment of the cue ball depends on the type of foul. If the cue ball had been scratched, the cue ball must be placed behind the break line.{{clarify|date=July 2015|reason=On both tries, or just the first one?}} If it was some other foul which had occurred while playing the 8 ball, the cue ball is not moved. If the incoming opponent scratches,{{clarify|date=July 2015|reason=Does a scratch by the incoming opponent on EITHER turn give two turns to original shooter, or only if the scratch was on the 2nd one? What about non-scratch fouls? Does a foul on the first attempt just lead to the second attempt, or does the original player now get two chances? Does a foul on the 2nd attempt lead to two changes for the original shooter, or just end the incoming opponent's turn?}} the player who originally fouled now receives two chances. When the 8 ball is the only ball on the table, any kind of foul ends the game, and the opponent of the fouling player wins.\n\n=== Latin America ===\n\nThe {{Cuegloss|rack}}ed balls are often loose, crooked or not exactly on the {{Cuegloss|foot spot}} (it is not considered to matter), and the [[Rack (billiards)|rack]] itself may be made of rubber, and flexible, making a tight rack physically impossible to achieve. Other than the 8 ball, other balls may be placed far more randomly than players in other areas would tolerate, with large clusters of solids together, and stripes with each other.\n\nIn most of [[Latin America]], including Mexico, shots are un-{{Cuegloss|call}}ed, as in British pool (i.e., {{Cuegloss|slop}} shots count, a concept foreign to most American players other than [[American Poolplayers Association|APA]] league members). In many if not most areas (Brazil being an exception), fouls result in {{Cuegloss|ball-in-hand}} behind the {{Cuegloss|head string}} only, as in American bar pool (allowing for intentional scratches that leave the opponent a very difficult shot if all opponent balls are \"in the {{Cuegloss|kitchen}}\", behind the headstring).\n\nA common Latin American variant of \"{{Cuegloss|last-pocket}}\" is that each player is allowed either one (or even two) cue-ball scratches when shooting for the 8, which {{em|must}} be pocketed in the same pocket as the shooter's final object ball. Such fouls simply end the shooter's turn at the table and give the opponent ball-in-hand behind the head string; only the second (or third, respectively) such scratch is a loss of game (though scratching the 8 ball itself off the table or into the wrong pocket is an instant loss). This version is common even in US pool bars that are frequented by recent [[Latinos|Latino]] immigrants. This requirement has a profound effect upon game strategy \u2013 it is effectively 5 times harder to {{Cuegloss|run out}} \u2013 and most North American (and British, etc.) players are completely unprepared for it, unless they are last-pocket players. Players must be very mindful what they do with their last few balls, and common failure to get {{Cuegloss|shape}} that allows for the last object-ball shot to set the player up for an easy 8 ball shot into the same pocket leads to long games with many {{Cuegloss|bank}}, {{Cuegloss|kick}} and {{Cuegloss|kiss}} shots on the 8.\n\nIn some parts of Latin America, especially South America, the 1 ball often must be pocketed in the side pocket on the right-hand side of the table (relative to the end of the table one breaks from), and the 15 ball must be pocketed in the left side pocket. This rule probably developed to make it harder to run out after the first shot. Position play takes a larger role in this variation, and a player's strategy must necessarily initially revolve around getting the 1 or 15 in while preventing this opponent from doing likewise. When racking the balls for this variation, the 1 and 15 balls are placed behind the 8 ball at the center of the rack, the 1 ball on the left and the 15 ball on the right (from the {{em|racker's}} perspective). Latino last-pocket is virtually the only version of eight-ball played in Mexico, other than in the [[Mexico\u2013United States border]] area.<!-- Is there a name for this variation? --> Another variant in Latin America is that the only ball-in-hand (behind the head string) foul is {{Cuegloss|scratch}}ing the cue ball into a pocket; other fouls are simply loss-of-turn.\n\nIn Mexico, a minority of players rack with the 8 ball rather than the apex ball on the foot spot, a trait in common with British-style [[Blackball (pool)|blackball/8-ball pool]]. Pocketing the 8 ball on the {{Cuegloss|break}} shot is an instant win, as it usually is in American bar pool, but is not in the international rules. Because Mexican pool, except near the US border, is almost always played on open-pocket [[Billiard hall|pool-hall]]-style tables, rather than coin-operated tables that trap object balls, any of one's own balls pocketed on a foul are {{Cuegloss|spot}}ted (but how they are spotted varies widely, with the balls often placed against the {{Cuegloss|foot cushion}} on the {{Cuegloss|center string}}, and adjacent to nearby {{Cuegloss|diamonds}} if more than one must be spotted, instead of on the foot spot, but sometimes even to the {{em|side}} at {{Cuegloss|long rail}} diamonds, due to the influence of [[Coyote (pool)|coyote]], a Mexican variant of [[Chicago (pool)|Chicago]]; foot-spot spotting is neither common nor uncommon.) Pool itself is not considered a very serious game in the country other than in the northern [[States of Mexico|states]]; in most of Mexico, [[three-cushion billiards]] is the serious game, while pool is mostly played by youths, by groups of friends (including many young women) as a bar game to pass the time, and by older working-class men as an after-work activity. In many recreation halls, [[dominoes]] is more popular than pool. In Mexico, there is a legend of a pool player called El Motore. Nobody knows his real identity, only legends of him pocketing all the balls blind folded 20 times in a row.\n\nIn many bars in Brazil (and not an official rule), a foul is generally punished by pocketing the lowest-numbered ball of the opponent. In that case, the cue ball remains where it stopped, as ball-in-hand is not commonly used. Additionally, in the case of scratching the cue ball, the opponent places the cue ball in the {{Cuegloss|kitchen}}, on the {{Cuegloss|head spot}}, or most commonly anywhere inside {{Cuegloss|\"D\", the|the \"D\"}}, indicating some British [[snooker]] or [[Blackball (pool)|blackball]] influence.\n\n===New Zealand===\n{{Unreferenced section|date=March 2011|reason=This section may be original research or local stuff; the NZ pool film \"Stickmen\" seems to contradict most or all of this.}}\nNew Zealand eight-ball in many respects is closer to British [[Blackball (pool)|blackball]], but with numbered balls being used. {{Cuegloss|\"D\", the|A \"D\"}} is typically drawn on the table above the {{cuegloss|baulk line}}<!--Does it coincide with the headstring, by running from diamond to diamond, or it is a bit closer to the bottom [head] rail, proportionally, like in snooker?--> (as on a snooker table) and the shooting player is required to place the cue ball within it on the {{cuegloss|break-off}} and after an opponent {{cuegloss|Scratch|scratches}}. The shooting player can shoot the ball in any direction from within the \"D\". If no \"D\" is drawn on the table then the \"forward play\" rule is followed: After a scratch, the player with ball-in-hand must shoot forward of the baulk line (i.e., towards the rack area, even if all legal balls are behind the baulk line). The \"{{Cuegloss|Two shots|two-shot rule}}\" of blackball may or may not be followed; this depends on individual players and pubs.\n\nThe \"nomination\" rule is unique to New Zealand: A player {{Cuegloss|snooker}}ed on the 8 ball may nominate one of the opponent's balls (if any remain) to hit as an alternative, legal \"{{cuegloss|ball on}}\". However, the shooter is not permitted to pot (pocket) such a nominated ball \u2013 doing so results in a loss of game.\n\n===North Africa===\nIn North African countries (as in Latin America, but reversed), both the 1 and 15 balls must be pocketed in the sides, the 15 on the right and 1 on the left (relative to the end of the table one breaks from). The North African version of the informal game is always played \"{{Cuegloss|last-pocket}}\". {{Cuegloss|Ball-in-hand}} is not taken on fouls, and \"{{Cuegloss|bank-the-8}}\" is a very common rule in addition to last-pocket.\n\n=== Pakistan ===\nDuring game play, if the player fails to hit a ball of the designated group, or hits the opponent's ball with the cue ball, then the opponent receives 2 shots unless the opponent has pocketed all his or her balls and only the 8 ball remains, in which case the opponent will only get one shot. In case of such a foul, the game continues with the player playing the cue ball at the place where it stopped. If a scratch occurs, then the opponent plays ball-in-hand, but is only allowed to place it anywhere in the D. However, that player may shoot the cue ball in any direction. Knocking a ball (apart from the cue ball) off the table carries no penalty. Instead, the misplaced ball is returned to its original place and the game continues. Player should call the pocket for the 8th ball and the shot should be clean such as there is no kisses, caroms or combinations unless it is agreed prior to the game.\n\n===United Kingdom and Ireland===\n{{Expand section|date=August 2008}}<!--There are almost certainly actual eight-ball as opposed to 8-ball pool/blackball rules in the UK and Ireland that need to be documented here.-->\n{{further|Blackball (pool)}}\nPool is popularly played in two forms. Traditionally it is played with smaller balls than the internationally standardized version, on a 4.5 by 7-foot [[Public house|pub]]-sized table, with differently shaped, smaller pockets. The {{cuegloss|cue ball}} is also slightly smaller than the {{cuegloss|object balls}}. \"American-style\" pool tables are also common in the UK, especially for [[nine-ball]] competition; the tables themselves are often referred to as \"nine-ball tables\", with that game being played only rarely on the more common, smaller traditional British-style tables. The two most common competitive rule sets used on the traditional tables are WEPF world {{sic|hide=y|eightball pool}} rules<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.epa.org.uk/wrules.php|title=ENGLISH POOL ASSOCIATION|accessdate=13 December 2015}}</ref> (replacing old EPA rules),<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.epa.org.uk/rules.php|title=ENGLISH POOL ASSOCIATION|accessdate=13 December 2015}}</ref> and WPA world-standardized blackball rules.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wpa-pool.com/web/index.asp?id=117&pagetype=rules|title=World Pool-Billiard Association \u2013 9 Ball Rules|accessdate=13 December 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151205092931/http://www.wpa-pool.com/web/index.asp?id=117&pagetype=rules|archive-date=5 December 2015|url-status=dead}}</ref> Most amateurs play \"pub rules\", meaning the local rule variation established at that venue.\n\nUnlike the American variation of Spots and Stripes, British Pool is primarily played using two sets of colours, reds and yellows along with the standard black 8-ball and white cueball. These balls are two inches in diameter with the cue ball being either the same size or slightly smaller at one inch and 7/8, Aramith are the most popular brand of Pool balls used in Great Britain. English Pool is most often played using both sets of standardized competitive rule sets have features to which some amateur pub players object. As one example, WEPF rules permit intentional fouls. Despite opponents being awarded two visits for a standard foul in pub pool, for one to cause an intentional foul or to not try to play a legal shot is seen as unsportsmanlike (as it is in pub/bar pool in the US and many other places). As another example, in WPA rules, rather than {{cuegloss|two-shot carry|getting two independent visits}} after a foul, the incoming player gets one {{cuegloss|Free ball|free shot}} and then play returns to normal. As most pub rules are based around old EPA rules, in which two visits are awarded (rather than a free shot) amateurs are often unhappy with this difference in blackball, although it is in no way as offensive as intentional fouls which are illegal in blackball and result in {{em|loss of frame}}.\n\nNot all differences are controversial. Both WEPF and WPA require a player to either pot on their visit, or drive any ball, including the white, into a cushion after hitting a legal object ball, or else they give a foul. Although the precise specifics of the rule are a mouthful, many amateur players find it acceptable. It is intended primarily as a way to prevent \"tucking up\", whereby a player does not attempt to pot and instead just rolls up to their object ball to use it to snooker their opponent; tucking up is seen as unsporting, so being forced to play harder shots is quite welcomed.\n\nThere are several sets of rules which use a combination of many others in an attempt to find a balance between WPA rules, which are seen as more aggressive, and WEPF rules which are often referred to, pejoratively, as \"chess\" because of the amount of {{cuegloss|safety}} play they encourage, which can drag a game out.\n\n===United States===\n{{More citations needed section|date=August 2008}}\n[[File:PoolPlayers.jpg|thumb|300px|American players at a bar in New York (2006)]]\nMost commonly of all in American {{Cuegloss|bar pool}} \u2013 sometimes called '''straight eight''' by its aficionados, and usually played on coin-operated, smaller tables \u2013 a requirement may be that all shots be {{cuegloss|Call-shot|called}} {{em|in detail}}. This typically includes what balls and bank/kick cushions will be involved in the shot, and in what order. The shot considered a turn-ending (but not ball-in-hand) foul if not executed precisely as planned, but a loss of game if the \"foul\" shot pocketed the 8 ball.<ref>See for example: {{Cite web\n|url=http://www.pool-billiards-game.com/billiard-rules.html\n|title=Billiard Rules? Bar Rules, League Rules, Which Rules Are Straight Eight?\n|first=Ted\n|last=Mauro\n|work=Pool-Billiards-Game.com\n|location=[[Pueblo, Colorado]]\n|publisher=self-published\n|year=2007\n|accessdate=2009-06-13\n}} Many other blogs and offline personal writings can confirm this author's take on the matter, but little authoritative has been written on the subject, as \"bar pool\" is of little consequence in the world of organized pool.</ref> Contrariwise, some Americans hold that nothing other than the 8 ball has to be called in any way (i.e., that \"{{cuegloss|slop}}\" counts).\n\nIn informal amateur play in most areas, the table will only be considered open if no balls were pocketed, or an equal number of stripes and solids were pocketed, or the cue ball was {{cuegloss|scratch}}ed (into a pocket or off the table), on the {{cuegloss|break}}; if an odd number of balls were legally pocketed, such as one solid and two stripes, or no solids and one stripe, the breaker must shoot the balls that were pocketed in the greatest quantity (stripes in these examples). The table is almost never considered so {{cuegloss|open}} as for it to be legal to use a ball of the opposite {{cuegloss|suit}}, much less the 8 ball, as the first ball in a combination shot while the table is open (despite this being perfectly legal in WPA World Standardized and many US league rules). In non-{{cuegloss|money games}} it is fairly common for a foul break in which the rack was not struck at all (e.g., due to a {{cuegloss|miscue}}) to be re-shot by the original breaker.\n\nFouls, in common bar pool, that are not cue-ball scratches generally only cause loss of turn, with cue ball left in place (even if it is {{cuegloss|hook}}ed). Even in the case of a scratch, this only results in {{cuegloss|ball-in-hand}} {{em|behind the {{cuegloss|head string}}}}. Regionally, there is a great deal of bar pool variation in the handling of fouls while shooting at or pocketing the 8 ball. In some cases any foul while shooting at but not pocketing the 8 is a loss of game, in others only a foul while otherwise successfully pocketing the 8, and in yet others only certain fouls, such as also sinking an opponent's ball and the 8 ball on the same shot, or hitting the 8 then cue-ball scratching, are game-losing.\n\nWhat is considered a foul further diverges from established, published rulesets. Scoop-under {{cuegloss|jump shot}}s are usually considered valid (these are fouls in WPA and most league rules, as they are {{cuegloss|double-hit}}s, though few players realize it). When a cue ball is frozen or near-frozen to an object ball, shooting it dead-on, in line with both balls, is a foul in most formal rulesets (as another kind of double-hit), but is generally tolerated in bar pool.\n\nOther US bar pool oddities varying from area to area include: Knocking the cue ball off the table on the break may be an instant loss; scratching on the break may be an instant loss; pocketing the 8 ball on the break (without scratching) may be either an instant win or instant loss (the latter being a rare variant); no safeties may be allowed at all \u2013 all shots may be required to be at least vaguely plausible attempts to pocket a legal ball; all jump shots may be banned; {{cuegloss|mass\u00e9}} shots may be banned; it may be illegal to use the 8 ball in any way in combinations, caroms, or kisses; the 8 ball may be required to be pocketed \"cleanly\" in the sense of no contact with other object balls (even if the {{cuegloss|kiss}} shot can be accurately called); failure to hit one of one's own object balls (or the 8 if shooting for the 8) may be considered a \"table scratch\" that gives the opponent a shot in-hand from behind the head string; failure to hit the 8 if shooting for the 8 may be a loss of game; and a \"split\" shot, where the cue ball appears to simultaneously strike a legal ball and an opponent's object ball, may be considered a legal shot, as long as it is called as a split shot, and the hit is simultaneous to the naked eye.\n\n\"{{Cuegloss|Bank-the-8}}\" is a common American amateur variation, especially on coin-operated {{Cuegloss|bar tables}} (because it usually makes the game last longer), in which the 8 ball must be {{Cuegloss|Bank shot|banked}} off one or more {{Cuegloss|cushions}} ({{Cuegloss|kick shot}}s may also qualify in some versions), into the {{Cuegloss|Call-pocket|called pocket}}; either player may suggest bank-the-eight at any time before or during the game, and the other may accept or refuse; all other rules apply as usual. Playing bank-the-eight may be considered rude if other players are waiting for a turn at the table.\n\nA similarly motivated variant is \"{{Cuegloss|last-pocket}}\", in which the 8 ball must be pocketed in the same pocket as the shooting player's last object ball (i.e., each player may be said to eventually \"own\" a pocket in which their 8 ball shot must be played if they have already run out their {{Cuegloss|suit}}); all other rules apply as usual. This variant is also popular in Mexico.\n\nDue probably to the influence of [[nine-ball]], in which the 1 ball ''must'' be the apex ball of the rack, most American bar players traditionally rack a game of eight-ball with the 1 ball in this position. Racking is also typically done solid-stripe-solid-stripe-solid along the two sides of the rack, resulting in solids being on all three corners. This is not a legal rack in World Standardized Rules, nor any other notable league ruleset other than [[American Poolplayers Association|APA]].\n\n<!-- *******************************************************************************************\n        Please do NOT add your school, local club, league, neighborhood\n        or even city variants.

As with American-style eight-ball, there are multiple competing standards bodies that have issued international rules. Aside from using unnumbered object balls (except for the 8), UK-style tables have pockets just larger than the balls. More than one type of {{Cuegloss|rest}} is typically used. Most tables do not have {{cuegloss|diamond}}s on the rails, and consequently the racking spot is on the {{cuegloss|baulk line}} not at the second-diamond {{cuegloss|headstring}}. The rules significantly differ in numerous ways, including the handling of fouls, which may give the opponent two shots, racking (the 8 ball, not the apex ball, goes on the spot), selection of which group of balls will be shot by which player, handling of {{Cuegloss|frozen}} balls and {{Cuegloss|snooker}}s, and many other details.\n\nThe English Pool Association<ref>[http://www.epa.org.uk/index.php English Pool Association]</ref> is recognized by the [[UK Sport|Sports Council]] as the governing body for pool including blackball in England.\n<!--DO NOT ADD PUB-POOL RULES TO THIS SECTION!-->\n\n===Eight-ball rotation===\n{{Details|Rotation (pool)}}\nThe hybrid game '''eight-ball rotation''' is a combination of eight-ball and [[Rotation (pool)|rotation]], in which the players must pocket their balls (other than the 8, which remains last) in numerical order. Specifically, the solids player starts by pocketing the 1 ball and ascends to the 7 ball, and the stripes player starts by pocketing the 15 ball and descends to the 9 ball.\n\n==See also==\n*[[List of World Eight-ball Champions]]\n\n==References==\n{{More citations needed|date=March 2009}}\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n\n<!--=========================({{NO JUNK LINKS}})===========================\n    | PLEASE BE CAUTIOUS IN ADDING MORE LINKS TO THIS ARTICLE.

Robotboy has three modes: deactivated, activated, and superactivated. In his superactivated mode, Robotboy has a wide array of weapons at his disposal, but his main weapons are Gatling lasers. Robotboy had the following \"modes\":\n** Deactivated \u2013 Robotboy's doll mode. In it, he is the smallest in size and he is not able to move or talk. However, he is seen lighting up his eyes and smiling in several episodes.\n** Activated \u2013 While activated, Robotboy can talk, express emotions, fly, fight and use some special abilities, introduced throughout the series.\n** Superactivated \u2013 Activated when Robotboy hits his hands together, increasing his size and overall strength greatly. He has the ability to shoot down enemies with various kinds of missiles and laser cannons. While superactivated, he cannot talk, although he produces growling-like noises while turned evil by Kamikazi in \"Crying Time\".\n*'''Tommy Turnbull''' \u2013 Robotboy's 10-year-old<ref name=CNTurnbull /> owner and human best friend. He acts as a role model and mentor/father figure to Robotboy and cares deeply for him. Unlike Gus, he is bright, sensible, kind and responsible, although he gets criticized by his parents for being rather weedy/not getting enough exercise.\n*'''Augustus \"Gus\"/\"G-Man\" Bachmann Turner''' \u2013 Tommy's overweight, rude, self-centered and dumb best friend. Despite coming from an Amish family, Gus is the black sheep of the bunch. He is obsessed with food and video games. Usually, it is his selfish nature that gets everyone into situations caused by Kamikaze.\n*'''Lola Mbola''' - 10-year-old Lola is the confident and smart daughter of a rich African ambassador. She can fly jet planes and control speedboats despite her age and secretly has a crush on Tommy (but would be devastated if he ever found out).\n*'''Robotgirl''' \u2013 A super fighting robot just like Robotboy, who was introduced in the episode \"Robotgirl\". Her last appearance was in \"The Return of Robotgirl\". She quickly made good friends with Robotboy and was only seen superactivated twice, both times in episode \"Robotgirl\". In the first place, she had to be convinced by Moshimo to use her ultimate powers, otherwise she would never see her friends again. In \"The return of Robotgirl\" she was brought back to Tommy with a distress message by Moshimo, she could not be activated until she was repaired by Tommy and she suffered from a major memory loss, but was convinced by Lola to use her emotions in favour of the kids' team. In the end she was defeated in a fight against Protoboy and then was saved by Robotboy and Moshimo.\n*'''Dr. Kamikazi''' \u2013 A small old man with thick glasses and a suit/bathrobe combo who is a self-proclaimed evil genius and the main antagonist of the show. He wishes to capture Robotboy to create a template for an army of super robots, with which he will be able to achieve his dastardly goal of world domination. Most of his henchmen have a large letter K on their uniforms, to show that they are on Dr. Kamikazi's side. He has had many pets, ranging from snakes to cats, but as a running gag they usually always hurt him.\n*'''Constantine''' \u2013 A fat hunchbacked [[hitman]] of Dr. Kamikazi who also is a master of sumo wrestling. He is a sensitive and none too threatening sidekick to Dr. Kamikazi who mainly acts as his muscle power as well as his assistant. Constantine is also a refined chef, being able to create dishes ranging from Sashimi to tapas. It is mentioned occasionally that Constantine used to be an orphan before he started working for Kamikazi. Despite presumably being Japanese, Constantine can speak Spanish. He is also shown to be constantly pushed around and poorly treated by Kamikazi (even nearly getting killed by him in one episode), but yet he stays with him regardless as he feels he owes him his life for saving his. In one episode he was abruptly fired and replaced, but returned in the same episode as Kamikazi finally apologised. He is also shown to be compassionate to the Tommy Gang from time to time depending on the situation Kamikazi or he's in.\n*'''Donnie Turnbull'''\u2013 Tommy's older brother and secondary archenemy, he is a constant bully to every child in the neighborhood, including Gus and Tommy himself. He frequently calls people names, threatens them, beats them up etc., and yet despite this, Tommy still treats him as family. Some people exploit his attitude and poor intelligence for their benefit, usually Dr. Kamikazi. His bullying backfires in \"Donnie Turnbull's Day Off\" when  Robotboy drives him crazy when he decides to play [[Truancy|hooky]] from school in order to humiliate, expose and possibly destroy Robotboy.\n*'''Kurt''' \u2013 A sadistic bully at Tommy's school, he has blonde hair and wears a hat. He constantly bullies Gus and Tommy, as well as any other kid he finds. His dad is a [[spy]] who has used Kurt to try and capture Robotboy. Tommy sometimes has outsmarted Kurt and his cronies by outwitting them, usually with Robotboy. They became less frequent adversaries of Tommy after he fought them all at once and won all by himself (even if he thought Robotboy was helping him).\n*'''Bambi''' - A [[Queen bee (sociology)|Queen Bee]]-esque character and Tommy's love interest. Despite being clearly out of his league and already having Kurt as a boyfriend. Tommy still attempts to get her attention despite being treated like he doesn't exist.

He has his own robot double named Bj\u00f6rnbot, who is sometimes referred to as Brother Bjorn. Both were first introduced in the episode of the same name \u2013 \"Brother Bj\u00f6rn\". Their mission is to destroy Moshimo's creation \u2013 Robotboy, so Bj\u00f6rnbot would be the greatest fighting robot in the world.\n*'''Protoboy''' \u2013 Robotboy's evil brother, who was created by Moshimo in his earlier years, but later that same day he was stolen by young Kamikazi and Constantine and turned too evil to control. He was then forcibly deactivated by Constantine and stored in a large storage room inside of Kamikazi's quarters in Kaziland until he was saved by Robotboy. He also has the ability to superactivate just like Robotboy, but the cannon built into his left arm is static and cannot be switched with an arm or another weapon. Robotboy was seen superactivated in Protoboy's body in \"The Old Switcharobot\" but his cannon was damaged because Protoboy (in Robotboy's body) had removed some of its parts prior to the body switch.\n*'''Klaus Von Affenkugel''' \u2013 A super rich man from Germany with implied extreme [[Myopathy]], who wants to use Robotboy's parts to replace his own. He has been pushed around, harassed, beat up and abused by virtually everybody he knew since Childhood because of his disease. Because of his deformity, Klaus is carried around by his Bodyguard, Colleague, Assistant and Best Friend, a giant orangutan named Ludwig, the only living being who truly cared about him in his time of need.\n*'''Principal Dr Freeman Coldpepper''' - Tommy's Principal and nemesis. She is a liar and is obsessed with toys due to never being allowed to play with them as a child, instead having to make her own dolls out of tin foil and chicken bones. She abuses her position as principal to confiscate toys and play with them herself. She later returns for revenge to ruin Robotboy's cliffhanger and play with him forever.\n*'''Felonious Hexx''' - a famous magician who had his career ruined after getting ridiculed and humiliated by Gus during his performance, and ever since he's been a recurring villain. From one job to another, he's always ready to get back at Gus and/or possibly kill him given the chance.\n*'''Kurt's Father''' - He's a Secret Agent who strives to take Robotboy to reproduce him so he can use him for Government Means. Although his name is never mentioned, he's shown to be in a very low tier in his position. His base is located in the [[Transamerica Pyramid]].\n*'''Brainy-Yak''' \u2013 A super intelligent Yak given a new brain by Professor Moshimo, because he had been made fun of for being incredibly stupid. After Moshimo gave him a Brain Transplant, he became even more isolated and poorly treated from the rest of the herd for being too intelligent. Then Moshimo encouraged this behaviour because he didn't think it was a problem. After disappearing for a few decades, he seeks revenge for being ostracised from his herd, and being mistreated by Moshimo time and time again.\n\n==Home media==\n[[StudioCanal]] released three DVD volumes of ''Robotboy'' from 2007 only in [[France]].\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n{{wikiquote}}\n{{portal|Cartoon}}\n* http://www.cartoonnetwork.co.uk/show/robotboy\n* {{IMDb title|0482870|Robotboy}}\n* {{bcdb |Other_Studios/G/Gaumont/Alphanim/Robotboy/ |Robotboy }}\n* {{tv.com show|robotboy|Robotboy}}\n\n{{Cartoon Network}}\n{{Cartoon Network original programming}}\n{{Cartoon Network co-productions}}\n\n[[Category:Robotboy| ]]\n[[Category:2000s British animated television series]]\n[[Category:2005 British television series debuts]]\n[[Category:2008 British television series endings]]\n[[Category:2005 French television series debuts]]\n[[Category:2009 French television series endings]]\n[[Category:2000s French animated television series]]\n[[Category:British animated television programmes featuring anthropomorphic characters]]\n[[Category:British children's animated action television series]]\n[[Category:British children's animated adventure television series]]\n[[Category:British children's animated comedy television series]]\n[[Category:British children's animated science fiction television series]]\n[[Category:British children's animated superhero television series]]\n[[Category:French animated television programs featuring anthropomorphic characters]]\n[[Category:French children's animated action television series]]\n[[Category:French children's animated adventure television series]]\n[[Category:French children's animated comedy television series]]\n[[Category:French children's animated science fiction television series]]\n[[Category:French children's animated superhero television series]]\n[[Category:Anime-influenced Western animated television series]]\n[[Category:English-language television programs]]\n[[Category:Cartoon Network original programming]]\n[[Category:Television shows set in the United States]]\n[[Category:Animated television series about children]]\n[[Category:Animated television series about robots]]\n", "text_old": "{{refimprove|date=February 2015}}\n{{infobox television\n|show_name = Robotboy\n|image = Robotboy.png\n|genre =\n[[Comedy]]<br>[[Animation]]<br>[[Science fiction]]<br>[[Action film|Action]]<br>[[Adventure]]<br>[[Children's]]\n|creator = [[Jan Van Rijsselberge]]\n|writer = [[Robert Mittenthal]]<br />Michael Rubiner<br />Adam Cohen<br />Randolph Heard<br />[[Scott Peterson (comics)|Scott Peterson]]\n|director = [[Charlie Bean (animator)|Charlie Bean]] <small>(Season 1)</small><br />[[Bob Camp]] & Heath Kenny <small>(Season 2)</small>\n|voices = Laurence Bouvard<br>[[Lorraine Pilkington]]<br />[[Rupert Degas]]<br />[[Lewis MacLeod (actor)|Lewis MacLeod]]<br />[[Togo Igawa]]<br />Eiji Kusuhara\n|composer = Hans Helewaut\n|country = United Kingdom<br>France\n|language = English<br>French\n|num_seasons = 2\n|num_episodes = 52 (104 segments)\n|list_episodes = List of Robotboy episodes\n|executive_producer = Christian Davin<br />Cl\u00e9ment Clavet<br />Daniel Lennard<br />Finn Arnesen<br />J\u00e9r\u00e9mie Fajner <small>(co-executive producer, Season 2)</small>\n|runtime = 30 minutes\n|company = [[Alphanim]]<br />[[LuxAnimation]] <small>(Season 1)</small><br />Cofinova 1 <small>(Season 1)</small>\n|distributor=[[Alphanim]]\n|network = [[Cartoon Network (UK & Ireland)|Cartoon Network]] <small>(UK)</small><br />[[France 3]] <small>(France)</small>\n| first_aired = {{Start date|2005|11|1}}\n| last_aired = {{End date|2008|9|27}}\n|website = http://www.cartoonnetwork.co.uk/show/robotboy\n}}\n'''''Robotboy''''' is a British-French animated [[children's television series]] which is produced by French production company [[Alphanim]] for [[France 3]] and [[Cartoon Network (Europe)|Cartoon Network Europe]], as well as the studios [[LuxAnimation]] and Cofinova 1 in the first season.

Robotboy was seen superactivated in Protoboy's body in \"The Old Switcharobot\" but his cannon was damaged because Protoboy (in Robotboy's body) had removed some of its parts prior to the body switch.\n*Klaus Von Affenkugel \u2013 A super rich man from Germany with implied extreme [[Myopathy]], who wants to use Robotboy's parts to replace his own. He has been pushed around, harassed, beat up and abused by virtually everybody he knew since Childhood because of his disease. Because of his deformity, Klaus is carried around by his Bodyguard, Colleague, Assistant and Best Friend, a giant orangutan named Ludwig, the only living being who truly cared about him in his time of need.\n*Principal Dr Freeman Coldpepper - Tommy's Principal and nemesis. She is a liar and is obsessed with toys due to never being allowed to play with them as a child, instead having to make her own dolls out of tin foil and chicken bones. She abuses her position as principal to confiscate toys and play with them herself. She later returns for revenge to ruin Robotboy's cliffhanger and play with him forever.\n*Felonious Hexx - a famous magician who had his career ruined after getting ridiculed and humiliated by Gus during his performance, and ever since he's been a recurring villain. From one job to another, he's always ready to get back at Gus and/or possibly kill him given the chance.\n*Kurt's Father - He's a Secret Agent who strives to take Robotboy to reproduce him so he can use him for Government Means. Although his name is never mentioned, he's shown to be in a very low tier in his position. His base is located in the [[Transamerica Pyramid]].\n*Brainy-Yak \u2013 A super intelligent Yak given a new brain by Professor Moshimo, because he had been made fun of for being incredibly stupid. After Moshimo gave him a Brain Transplant, he became even more isolated and poorly treated from the rest of the herd for being too intelligent. Then Moshimo encouraged this behaviour because he didn't think it was a problem. After disappearing for a few decades, he seeks revenge for being ostracised from his herd, and being mistreated by Moshimo time and time again.\n\n==Home media==\n[[StudioCanal]] released three DVD volumes of ''Robotboy'' from 2007 only in [[France]].\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n{{wikiquote}}\n{{portal|Cartoon}}\n* http://www.cartoonnetwork.co.uk/show/robotboy\n* {{IMDb title|0482870|Robotboy}}\n* {{bcdb |Other_Studios/G/Gaumont/Alphanim/Robotboy/ |Robotboy }}\n* {{tv.com show|robotboy|Robotboy}}\n\n{{Cartoon Network}}\n{{Cartoon Network original programming}}\n{{Cartoon Network co-productions}}\n\n[[Category:Robotboy| ]]\n[[Category:2000s British animated television series]]\n[[Category:2005 British television series debuts]]\n[[Category:2008 British television series endings]]\n[[Category:2005 French television series debuts]]\n[[Category:2009 French television series endings]]\n[[Category:2000s French animated television series]]\n[[Category:British animated television programmes featuring anthropomorphic characters]]\n[[Category:British children's animated action television series]]\n[[Category:British children's animated adventure television series]]\n[[Category:British children's animated comedy television series]]\n[[Category:British children's animated science fiction television series]]\n[[Category:British children's animated superhero television series]]\n[[Category:French animated television programs featuring anthropomorphic characters]]\n[[Category:French children's animated action television series]]\n[[Category:French children's animated adventure television series]]\n[[Category:French children's animated comedy television series]]\n[[Category:French children's animated science fiction television series]]\n[[Category:French children's animated superhero television series]]\n[[Category:Anime-influenced Western animated television series]]\n[[Category:English-language television programs]]\n[[Category:Cartoon Network original programming]]\n[[Category:Television shows set in the United States]]\n[[Category:Animated television series about children]]\n[[Category:Animated television series about robots]]\n", "name_user": "LaundryPizza03", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eCharacters:Bold character names for readability", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robotboy"}

It is a follow-up to the 1975 film ''[[The Rocky Horror Picture Show]]''.\n\nWhile not an outright [[sequel]], the film does feature several characters from the previous film, most portrayed by different actors, as well as several ''Rocky Horror'' actors in new roles. The film stars [[Jessica Harper]] as Janet and [[Cliff De Young]] in a dual role as Brad and the film's main antagonist Farley Flavors, with O'Brien and [[Patricia Quinn]] playing sibling [[character actor]]s.\n\nGiven a [[limited release]] on the [[midnight movie]] circuit beginning on October 30, 1981, ''Shock Treatment'' was a critical and commercial failure, not earning the same level of [[cult film]] status its predecessor received. Since its release, the film has grown a more minor cult following than its predecessor. In 2015, the film was adapted as a stage production in London.\n\n==Plot==\nContinuing from ''[[The Rocky Horror Picture Show]]'' are the characters of Brad and Janet Majors (now portrayed by [[Cliff De Young]] and [[Jessica Harper]]), now married. The film takes place in the town of Denton, USA, which has been taken over by fast food magnate Farley Flavors (also De Young). The town of Denton is entirely encased within a television studio for the DTV (Denton Television) network. Residents are either stars and regulars on a show, cast and crew, or audience members. Brad and Janet, seated in the audience, are chosen to participate in the [[game show]] ''Marriage Maze'' by the kooky, supposedly blind host Bert Schnick ([[Barry Humphries]]). As a \"prize\", Brad is imprisoned on ''Dentonvale'', a [[soap opera]] that centers upon the local [[mental hospital]] run by brother and sister Cosmo and Nation McKinley ([[Richard O'Brien]] and [[Patricia Quinn]]).\n\nJanet is given a taste of showbiz as Farley molds her into a singing diva superstar in an attempt to take her away from Brad. Her compliance is assured through the use of drugs supplied by the McKinleys. Betty Hapschatt ([[Ruby Wax]]) and Judge Oliver Wright ([[Charles Gray (actor)|Charles Gray]]) investigate Farley and other people involved in DTV and  eventually discover that Cosmo and Nation are not doctors, but merely [[character actor]]s, and Farley Flavors is Brad's jealous, long-lost twin brother, seeking to destroy Brad and take Janet for himself. The pair rescue Brad from ''Dentonvale'' and have him confront his twin on his show ''Faith Factory''. Farley imprisons the three and Janet, but they manage to escape in a car along with a local band while the remainder of Denton's citizens follow Farley and commit themselves to ''Dentonvale''.\n\n==Cast==\n{{div col|colwidth=22em}}\n* [[Jessica Harper]] as Janet Majors (n\u00e9e [[The Rocky Horror Picture Show|Weiss]])\n* [[Cliff De Young]] as Brad Majors / Farley Flavors\n* [[Richard O'Brien]] as Dr. Cosmo McKinley\n* [[Patricia Quinn]] as Dr. Nation McKinley\n* [[Nell Campbell|Little Nell]] as Nurse Ansalong\n* [[Charles Gray (actor)|Charles Gray]] as Judge Oliver Wright\n* [[Barry Humphries]] as Bert Schnick\n* [[Ruby Wax]] as Betty Hapschatt (n\u00e9e [[The Rocky Horror Picture Show|Munroe]])\n* Jeremy Newson as Ralph Hapschatt\n* Wendy Raebeck as Macy Struthers\n* [[Rik Mayall]] as \"Rest Home\" Ricky\n* Darlene Johnson as Emily Weiss\n* Manning Redwood as Harry Weiss\n* [[Barry Dennen]] as Irwin Lapsey\n* [[Betsy Brantley]] as Neely Pritt\n* [[Christopher Malcolm|Chris Malcolm]] as Officer Vance Parker\n* [[Eugene Lipinski]] as Kirk\n* [[Gary Shail]] as Oscar Drill\n* Claire Toeman as Brenda Drill\n* Donald Waugh as Glish Davidson\n* David John as 'Bit' Drummer\n* [[Gary Martin (actor)|Gary Martin]] as 'Bit' Guitarist\n* [[Sinitta|Sinitta Renet]] as Frankie\n* [[Sal Piro]] (''uncredited'') as Guy on Pay Phone\n{{div col end}}\n\n==Soundtrack==\nCoinciding with the release of the film, Ode Records issued the soundtrack album on [[Gramophone record|vinyl]] and [[compact Cassette|cassette]] in 1981, and later reissued it on [[Compact disc|CD]] in 1994.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.rockymusic.org/album/shock.php|title=RockyMusic - Shock Treatment (Original Soundtrack) (1981)|website=www.rockymusic.org}}</ref> The album includes longer versions of \"Thank God I'm a Man\" and \"Carte Blanche\", as well as two unlisted bits taken directly from the film, the Farley Flavors \"commercial break\" (after \"Denton U.S.A.\") and the rhyming dialogue, which directly precedes \"Duel Duet\" (after \"Breaking Out\").<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20010407141643/http://www.geocities.com/sanityfortoday/shock.html|title=Shock Treatment|date=April 7, 2001|website=web.archive.org}}</ref>\n\nAll editions are missing Richard O'Brien's solo version of the title song (which plays during the end credits and features backing vocals by [[Nell Campbell]]), though it was released as a 7\" vinyl single,<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.rockymusic.org/album/shock-single7.php|title=RockyMusic - Shock Treatment 7\" Single|website=www.rockymusic.org}}</ref> and included on the CD ''Songs from the Vaults: A Collection of Rocky Horror Rarities'',<ref>[https://www.amazon.com/Songs-From-The-Vaults-Collection/dp/B000GYCAUS Amazon.com: Songs from the Vaults]</ref> which was exclusive to the ''Rocky Horror Picture Show 15th Anniversary'' boxed set.<ref name=\"flubs\">{{Cite web|url=http://www.theshocktreatmentnetwork.com/flubsandfacts.htm|title=Flubs And Facts|website=www.theshocktreatmentnetwork.com}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.discogs.com/Various-The-Rocky-Horror-Picture-Show-15th-Anniversary/release/2184070|title=Various - The Rocky Horror Picture Show 15th Anniversary|website=Discogs}}</ref>\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

Television had been a heavy motif in the script, so production designer [[Brian Thomson (scenic designer)|Brian Thomson]] came up with the notion to rework the story and set it in a giant TV studio, utilizing a film studio in England,<ref name=\"FilmReviewSpecial\"/> which shaved $1 million from the budget<ref name=\"face\"/> and gave them the luxury of working in a controlled environment. The script endured a final draft in which all of the locations were changed to television shows, and the role of Dr. Scott morphed into game show host Bert Schnick. \"I was frightened the strike was going to finish too soon and we\u2019d have to go back to our original conception,\" commented O'Brien.<ref name=\"face\"/>\n\n===Casting===\nMany ''Rocky Horror'' cast members returned for the film, but only Jeremy Newson reprised his role as Ralph Hapschatt. However, due to his title of \"Judge\", some fans have speculated that Gray is also reprising his role of the unnamed Criminologist. In addition to actors from ''Rocky Horror'', other alums filled out the cast. Many of the original film's Transylvanians appeared as audience members, while Imogen Claire was given the slightly-larger part of the Wardrobe Mistress. Raynor Bourton, who originated the titular role of Rocky in the stage production, portrayed one of the singing soldiers in Thank God I'm a Man, and [[Christopher Malcolm|Chris Malcolm]], who originated the role of Brad Majors, was cast as Vance Parker, a local police officer. Founder and long-time president of ''Rocky Horror'' [[fan club]], [[Sal Piro]], also has a silent [[cameo appearance]] as the man using the payphone during the opening sequence.\n\n[[Susan Sarandon]]'s star was on the rise, so she demanded more money to return than the budget allowed.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.theshocktreatmentnetwork.com/faq.htm|title=Shock Treatment F.A.Q.

It is a follow-up to the 1975 film ''[[The Rocky Horror Picture Show]]''.\n\nWhile not an outright [[sequel]], the film does feature several characters from the previous film, most portrayed by different actors, as well as several ''Rocky Horror'' actors in new roles. The film stars [[Jessica Harper]] as Janet and [[Cliff De Young]] in a dual role as Brad and the film's main antagonist Farley Flavors, with O'Brien and [[Patricia Quinn]] playing sibling [[character actor]]s.\n\nGiven a [[limited release]] on the [[midnight movie]] circuit beginning on October 30, 1981, ''Shock Treatment'' was a critical and commercial failure, not earning the same level of [[cult film]] status its predecessor received. Since its release, the film has grown a more minor cult following than its predecessor. In 2015, the film was adapted as a stage production in London.\n\n==Plot==\nContinuing from ''[[The Rocky Horror Picture Show]]'' are the characters of Brad and Janet Majors (now portrayed by [[Cliff De Young]] and [[Jessica Harper]]), now married. The film takes place in the town of Denton, USA, which has been taken over by fast food magnate Farley Flavors (also De Young). The town of Denton is entirely encased within a television studio for the DTV (Denton Television) network. Residents are either stars and regulars on a show, cast and crew, or audience members. Brad and Janet, seated in the audience, are chosen to participate in the [[game show]] ''Marriage Maze'' by the kooky, supposedly blind host Bert Schnick ([[Barry Humphries]]). As a \"prize\", Brad is imprisoned on ''Dentonvale'', a [[soap opera]] that centers upon the local [[mental hospital]] run by brother and sister Cosmo and Nation McKinley ([[Richard O'Brien]] and [[Patricia Quinn]]).\n\nJanet is given a taste of showbiz as Farley molds her into a singing diva superstar in an attempt to take her away from Brad. Her compliance is assured through the use of drugs supplied by the McKinleys. Betty Hapschatt ([[Ruby Wax]]) and Judge Oliver Wright ([[Charles Gray (actor)|Charles Gray]]) investigate Farley and other people involved in DTV and  eventually discover that Cosmo and Nation are not doctors, but merely [[character actor]]s, and Farley Flavors is Brad's jealous, long-lost twin brother, seeking to destroy Brad and take Janet for himself. The pair rescue Brad from ''Dentonvale'' and have him confront his twin on his show ''Faith Factory''. Farley imprisons the three and Janet, but they manage to escape in a car along with a local band while the remainder of Denton's citizens follow Farley and commit themselves to ''Dentonvale''.\n\n==Cast==\n{{div col|colwidth=22em}}\n* [[Jessica Harper]] as Janet Majors (n\u00e9e [[The Rocky Horror Picture Show|Weiss]])\n* [[Cliff De Young]] as Brad Majors / Farley Flavors\n* [[Richard O'Brien]] as Dr. Cosmo McKinley\n* [[Patricia Quinn]] as Dr. Nation McKinley\n* [[Nell Campbell|Little Nell]] as Nurse Ansalong\n* [[Charles Gray (actor)|Charles Gray]] as Judge Oliver Wright\n* [[Barry Humphries]] as Bert Schnick\n* [[Ruby Wax]] as Betty Hapschatt (n\u00e9e [[The Rocky Horror Picture Show|Munroe]])\n* Jeremy Newson as Ralph Hapschatt\n* Wendy Raebeck as Macy Struthers\n* [[Rik Mayall]] as \"Rest Home\" Ricky\n* Darlene Johnson as Emily Weiss\n* Manning Redwood as Harry Weiss\n* [[Barry Dennen]] as Irwin Lapsey\n* [[Betsy Brantley]] as Neely Pritt\n* [[Christopher Malcolm|Chris Malcolm]] as Officer Vance Parker\n* [[Eugene Lipinski]] as Kirk\n* [[Gary Shail]] as Oscar Drill\n* Claire Toeman as Brenda Drill\n* Donald Waugh as Glish Davidson\n* David John as 'Bit' Drummer\n* [[Gary Martin (actor)|Gary Martin]] as 'Bit' Guitarist\n* [[Sinitta|Sinitta Renet]] as Frankie\n* [[Sal Piro]] (''uncredited'') as Guy on Pay Phone\n{{div col end}}\n\n==Soundtrack==\nCoinciding with the release of the film, Ode Records issued the soundtrack album on [[Gramophone record|vinyl]] and [[compact Cassette|cassette]] in 1981, and later reissued it on [[Compact disc|CD]] in 1994.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.rockymusic.org/album/shock.php|title=RockyMusic - Shock Treatment (Original Soundtrack) (1981)|website=www.rockymusic.org}}</ref> The album includes longer versions of \"Thank God I'm a Man\" and \"Carte Blanche\", as well as two unlisted bits taken directly from the film, the Farley Flavors \"commercial break\" (after \"Denton U.S.A.\") and the rhyming dialogue, which directly precedes \"Duel Duet\" (after \"Breaking Out\").<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20010407141643/http://www.geocities.com/sanityfortoday/shock.html|title=Shock Treatment|date=April 7, 2001|website=web.archive.org}}</ref>\n\nAll editions are missing Richard O'Brien's solo version of the title song (which plays during the end credits and features backing vocals by [[Nell Campbell]]), though it was released as a 7\" vinyl single,<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.rockymusic.org/album/shock-single7.php|title=RockyMusic - Shock Treatment 7\" Single|website=www.rockymusic.org}}</ref> and included on the CD ''Songs from the Vaults: A Collection of Rocky Horror Rarities'',<ref>[https://www.amazon.com/Songs-From-The-Vaults-Collection/dp/B000GYCAUS Amazon.com: Songs from the Vaults]</ref> which was exclusive to the ''Rocky Horror Picture Show 15th Anniversary'' boxed set.<ref name=\"flubs\">{{Cite web|url=http://www.theshocktreatmentnetwork.com/flubsandfacts.htm|title=Flubs And Facts|website=www.theshocktreatmentnetwork.com}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.discogs.com/Various-The-Rocky-Horror-Picture-Show-15th-Anniversary/release/2184070|title=Various - The Rocky Horror Picture Show 15th Anniversary|website=Discogs}}</ref>\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

Television had been a heavy motif in the script, so production designer [[Brian Thomson (scenic designer)|Brian Thomson]] came up with the notion to rework the story and set it in a giant TV studio, utilizing a film studio in England,<ref name=\"FilmReviewSpecial\"/> which shaved $1 million from the budget<ref name=\"face\"/> and gave them the luxury of working in a controlled environment. The script endured a final draft in which all of the locations were changed to television shows, and the role of Dr. Scott morphed into game show host Bert Schnick. \"I was frightened the strike was going to finish too soon and we\u2019d have to go back to our original conception,\" commented O'Brien.<ref name=\"face\"/>\n\n===Casting===\nMany ''Rocky Horror'' cast members returned for the film, but only Jeremy Newson reprised his role as Ralph Hapschatt. However, due to his title of \"Judge\", some fans have speculated that Gray is also reprising his role of the unnamed Criminologist. In addition to actors from ''Rocky Horror'', other alums filled out the cast. Many of the original film's Transylvanians appeared as audience members, while Imogen Claire was given the slightly-larger part of the Wardrobe Mistress. Raynor Bourton, who originated the titular role of Rocky in the stage production, portrayed one of the singing soldiers in Thank God I'm a Man, and [[Christopher Malcolm|Chris Malcolm]], who originated the role of Brad Majors, was cast as Vance Parker, a local police officer. Founder and long-time president of ''Rocky Horror'' [[fan club]], [[Sal Piro]], also has a silent [[cameo appearance]] as the man using the payphone during the opening sequence.\n\n[[Susan Sarandon]]'s star was on the rise, so she demanded more money to return than the budget allowed.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.theshocktreatmentnetwork.com/faq.htm|title=Shock Treatment F.A.Q.

One is found south of the Poblacion in Barangay Caaga and the other in Barangay Abgao north of the Poblacion. Said watchtowers were constructed in the year 1820. The two barangays abovementioned were ruled by their chieftains, called capitanes. No traces could be found as to the names of the capitanes. As absolute rulers of their respective barangays, they tried to established their own kingdoms. Both of the chieftains wanted to rule the other, hence, there was strong and keen rivalry between the two and the pueblo was to be organized by the Spaniards sometimes in the middle part of the 18th century. The inhabitants were very much confused as to where the pueblo be located. Confusion in the local dialect means \"makalibog\". Since that time the Spaniards organized the pueblo, they called it Malitbog, a derivative or distorted word from the dialect \"makalibog\". They built the Town Center midway and equidistant between the two Barrios.\n\nThrough the intercession of the Roman Catholic Priest who often visited the two warring barangays, a proposal was made to the rival barangays to fuse the two communities and establish a bigger church. Again, trouble arose as to where the church be constructed.

In 1857, the Roman Catholic Church was built up in baroque architecture by forced labor. And in addition to the construction starting from the very portal of the church leading to the shoreline, going east to serve as the demarcation line between the two rival barangays, at the end of the dividing line a watchtower was constructed. This watchtower was constructed in the year 1862 as inscribed in the walls of the said watchtower. The town of Malitbog was created on December 14, 1849, and was later on reorganized under the provisions of the Maura Law of 1893 the territorial limits covered nineteen (19) kilometers to the south of the Poblacion including the island of Limasawa.\n\nIn 1897, a one-storey building in baroque style was constructed at the left side of the demarcation line also equidistant from the Catholic Church and the watchtower. The said building was believed to be the seat of government during the Spanish Regime. No traces could be found as to the name of the first governadorcillo, though at a later time prior to the Spanish\u2013American War, there were capitanes known in the locality by the name of Capitan Tonio Base and Capitan Esteban Piramide. During the American Regime, the town was reorganized under the provision of Act. No. 82 passed by the Second Philippine Commission in 1900. This Act was known as the Municipal Code and the First Municipal President of Malitbog was Francisco Esca\u00f1o. A house owned by a certain Macabuhay located at the corner of Calle Real and a street now known as Lopez Jaena served as the Municipal Hall and was later transferred to another private house owned by a certain Chinese merchant at the corner of Calle Real and a street now known as Mayor Va\u00f1o Street.\n\nThe American Regime in the early 1900 was marked with the establishment of public elementary schools. One of the school buildings was constructed near the old building built in baroque style during the Spanish era. This old building was later on made into a Municipal Hall. When the enrolment in the school increased, the newly constructed house could no longer accommodate until the local government came into agreement with the school authorities to exchange places. And so the Municipal Hall was transferred for the fourth time to the public school building until at present which remain to the seat of the Local Government Unit of Malitbog. In 1957 during the incumbency of President Carlos P. Garcia, several barrios in the southern portion of Malitbog including the island of Limasawa was created into a separate town as the municipality of Padre Burgos by virtue of an Executive Order No. 265. Fourteen (14) years later, the northern portion of Malitbog was declared into another town known as the municipality of Tomas Oppus, previously known as Santiago through the Act of Congress No. 5777 and further amended by Presidential Decree No. 134. Presently, the municipality has 37 barangays; 21 of which are coastal, 4 are inland and 12 are mountain barangays.\n\n==See also==\n*[[Ruperto Kangleon]]\n*[[Iliff David Richardson]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n{{Commonscat}}\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20120413163013/http://www.nscb.gov.ph/activestats/psgc/default.asp Philippine Standard Geographic Code]\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20131004104825/http://census.gov.ph/ Philippine Census Information]\n*[http://www.blgs.gov.ph/lgpmsv2/cmshome/index.php?pageID=23&frmIdDcfCode=7&fLguType=CM&frmIdRegion=11&frmIdProvince=1259&frmIdLgu=1322 Local Governance Performance Management System]\n\n{{Geographic location\n| Centre    = Malitbog\n| North     = [[Tomas Oppus, Southern Leyte|Tomas Oppus]]\n| East      = ''[[Sogod Bay]]'' / [[Liloan, Southern Leyte|Liloan]]\n| South     = [[Padre Burgos, Southern Leyte|Padre Burgos]]\n| Southwest = [[Macrohon, Southern Leyte|Macrohon]]\n| West      = [[Maasin]]\n}}\n{{Southern Leyte}}\n\n[[Category:Municipalities of Southern Leyte]]\n", "text_old": "{{Refimprove|date=July 2013}}\n{{Infobox settlement\n| name                   = {{PH wikidata|name}} \n| image_skyline          = Santo Ni\u00f1o Catholic Church in Malitbog, Southern Leyte.jpg \n| image_caption          = Roman Catholic Church of Santo Ni\u00f1o\n| image_seal             =   \n| seal_size              = 100x80px\n| image_map              = {{PH wikidata|image_map}}\n| map_caption            = {{PH wikidata|map_caption}}\n| image_map1             = {{Infobox mapframe|id={{#invoke:Wikibase|id}}}}\n| pushpin_map            = Philippines\n| pushpin_label_position = left\n| pushpin_map_caption    = Location within the {{PH wikidata|country}}\n| coordinates            = {{PH wikidata|coordinates}}\n| settlement_type        = {{PH wikidata|settlement_type}}\n| subdivision_type       = [[List of sovereign states|Country]]\n| subdivision_name       = {{flag|Philippines}}\n| subdivision_type1      = [[Regions of the Philippines|Region]]\n| subdivision_name1      = {{PH wikidata|region}}\n| subdivision_type2      = [[Provinces of the Philippines|Province]]\n| subdivision_name2      = {{PH wikidata|province}}\n| official_name          = {{PH wikidata|official_name}}\n| etymology              =  <!--origin of name-->\n| named_for              =  <!--named after (if person or place)-->\n| native_name            =\n| other_name             =\n| nickname               =\n| motto                  =\n| anthem                 =\n| subdivision_type3      = [[House of Representatives of the Philippines#District representation|District]]\n| subdivision_name3      = [[Legislative districts of Southern Leyte|1st District]]\n| established_title      = Founded\n| established_date       = <!--foundation date-->\n| parts_type             = [[Barangay]]s\n| parts_style            = para\n| p1                     = 37 (see [[#Barangays|Barangays]])\n| leader_title           = {{PH wikidata|leader_title}} <!--mayor-->\n| leader_name            = Jose M.

One is found south of the Poblacion in Barangay Caaga and the other in Barangay Abgao north of the Poblacion. Said watchtowers were constructed in the year 1820. The two barangays abovementioned were ruled by their chieftains, called capitanes. No traces could be found as to the names of the capitanes. As absolute rulers of their respective barangays, they tried to established their own kingdoms. Both of the chieftains wanted to rule the other, hence, there was strong and keen rivalry between the two and the pueblo was to be organized by the Spaniards sometimes in the middle part of the 18th century. The inhabitants were very much confused as to where the pueblo be located. Confusion in the local dialect means \"makalibog\". Since that time the Spaniards organized the pueblo, they called it Malitbog, a derivative or distorted word from the dialect \"makalibog\".\n\nThrough the intercession of the Roman Catholic Priest who often visited the two warring barangays, a proposal was made to the rival barangays to fuse the two communities and establish a bigger church. Again, trouble arose as to where the church be constructed. A settlement was later on made through the insinuation of the priest that the church be built not in any of the two barangays but in a location that shall serve as boundaries between them.

The town of Malitbog was created on December 14, 1849, and was later on reorganized under the provisions of the Maura Law of 1893 the territorial limits covered nineteen (19) kilometers to the south of the Poblacion including the island of Limasawa.\n\nIn 1897, a one-storey building in baroque style was constructed at the left side of the demarcation line also equidistant from the Catholic Church and the watchtower.

This trend has continued with many players representing New Zealand in two sports or representing two different countries in rugby league due to the eligibility rules in place at the time. For example, [[Dally Messenger]] represented Australia in both rugby union and rugby league as well as playing with the 1907 touring side.\n\nOf the 36 players that have played for both the Kiwis and the [[All Blacks]], only [[Karl Ifwersen]] and [[Sonny Bill Williams]]  have been a Kiwi before they became an All Black.\n\nAs well as the dual internationals below, [[Charles Savory]] won the New Zealand National Amateur Heavyweight Boxing championship in 1914, [[Sonny Bill Williams]] won the [[New Zealand Professional Boxing Association]] Heavyweight Championship in 2012 and Kiwis captain [[Puti Tipene Watene|Puti Tipene (Steve) Watene]] became a [[Member of Parliament]] after his retirement from rugby league.<ref name=akl100>Coffey, John and Bernie Wood ''Auckland, 100 years of rugby league, 1909-2009'', 2009. {{ISBN|978-1-86969-366-4}}, p.46</ref>\n\nFour Kiwis have gone on to be test referees; [[Albert House]], [[Maurice Wetherill]], [[Vic Belsham]] and [[Henry Perenara]].<ref>[http://www.nzrl.co.nz/media/63553/in%20touch%20nov%20dec%202011.pdf In Touch] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150114025947/http://www.nzrl.co.nz/media/63553/in%20touch%20nov%20dec%202011.pdf |date=14 January 2015 }} ''New Zealand Rugby League'', December 2011</ref>\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" \n!width=\"100\"|Country!!width=\"80\"|Sport!!width=\"50\"|No.!!Players\n|-\n|[[All Blacks|New Zealand]]||rugby union||37||[[Albert Asher]], [[Frano Botica]], [[Alphonsus Carroll]], [[Bert Cooke (rugby)|Bert Cooke]], [[Tom Cross (rugby)|Tom Cross]], [[Marc Ellis (rugby)|Marc Ellis]], [[David Evans (rugby)|Dave Evans]], [[Charles Fitzgerald (rugby)|Charles Fitzgerald]], [[Arthur Francis (rugby)|Arthur Francis]], [[George A.

But in his account, Oghuz Khan is fully integrated into Islamic and Mongol traditional history. The account begins with descent from [[Adam]] to [[Noah]], who after [[Noah's flood|the flood]] sends his three sons to repopulate the earth: [[Ham (son of Noah)|Ham]] was sent to Hindustan, [[Shem|Sam]] to Iran, and [[Japheth|Yafes]] was sent to the banks of the Itil and Yaik rivers.

Twenty-four grandsons from the eldest wives of the sons of Oghuz Khan were the ancestors of the 24 oldest and main Oghuz-Turkmen tribes and the heads of the so-called \"Aimak\". Each of the main 24 tribes was joined by other tribes whose ancestors were the grandsons of Oghuz Khan from the secondary wives of his sons and so on: this is the main association of several clans that formed a single \"Aimak\".\n\nTwo united Aimaks formed \"yuzluks\". The yuzluks, in turn, were grouped into two main groups:\" Bozok (senior tribe) and Uchok (junior tribe). Thus, the entire ancient Oghuz-Turkmen people were divided into two parts (Bozok and Uchok): each of these parts was divided into 12 yuzluks, and each of the yuzluks was divided into two Aimaks.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.wdl.org/ru/item/16942/|title=Turkmenistan and Turkmens|author=O.

But in his account, Oghuz Khan is fully integrated into Islamic and Mongol traditional history. The account begins with descent from [[Adam]] to [[Noah]], who after [[Noah's flood|the flood]] sends his three sons to repopulate the earth: [[Ham (son of Noah)|Ham]] was sent to Hindustan, [[Shem|Sam]] to Iran, and [[Japheth|Yafes]] was sent to the banks of the Itil and Yaik rivers. Yafes had eight sons named Turk, Khazar, Saqlab, Rus, Ming, Chin, Kemeri, and Tarikh. As he was dying, he established Turk as his successor.\n\n==Tribal organization==\n[[File:Gorskii 04412u.jpg|thumb|right|200px|[[Turkmens|Turkmen]] woman at the entrance to a yurt in [[Turkestan]]; 1911 color photograph by [[Sergei Mikhailovich Prokudin-Gorskii|Prokudin-Gorskii]]]]\nAccording to the \"Genealogy of the Turkmens\", Oghuz Khan had six sons in total, and each of them in turn had 4 sons from their eldest (first) wives and several more from their other wives. Twenty-four grandsons from the eldest wives of the sons of Oghuz Khan were the ancestors of the 24 oldest and main Oghuz-Turkmen tribes and the heads of the so-called \"Aimak\". Each of the main 24 tribes was joined by other tribes whose ancestors were the grandsons of Oghuz Khan from the secondary wives of his sons and so on: this is the main association of several clans that formed a single \"Aimak\".\n\nTwo united Aimaks formed \"yuzluks\". The yuzluks, in turn, were grouped into two main groups:\" Bozok (senior tribe) and Uchok (junior tribe). Thus, the entire ancient Oghuz-Turkmen people were divided into two parts (Bozok and Uchok): each of these parts was divided into 12 yuzluks, and each of the yuzluks was divided into two Aimaks.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.wdl.org/ru/item/16942/|title=Turkmenistan and Turkmens|author=O.
