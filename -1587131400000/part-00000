Thus, the key feature that allows hemoglobin F to bind more strongly to oxygen is by having \u03b3 subunits (instead of \u03b2, for example). In fact, some naturally existing molecules in our body can bind to hemoglobin and change its binding affinity for oxygen. One of the molecules is [[2,3-bisphosphoglycerate|2,3-bisphosphoglycerate (2,3-BPG)]] and it enhances hemoglobin\u2019s ability to release oxygen.<ref name=\"Gerald 2018\">{{Cite book | authors= Litwack G| title= Human Biochemistry | year=2018 | chapter=Chapter 8 \u2013 Glycolysis and Glocuneogenesis | publisher=Academic press| isbn = 978-0-12-383864-3}}</ref> 2,3-BPG interacts much more with hemoglobin A than hemoglobin F. This is because the adult \u03b2 subunit has more positive charges than the fetal \u03b3 subunit, which attract the negative charges from 2,3-BPG. Due to the preference of 2,3-BPG for hemoglobin A, hemoglobin F binds to oxygen with more affinity, in average.<ref name=\"Duane 2016\">{{cite web|title= Comparing the molecular structure differences between HbF and HbA that affect BPG binding|last= Sears|first= Duane|date= 2016|website= Biosci Portal|url=https://biosci.mcdb.ucsb.edu/biochemistry/tw-hbn/hbf/hbf-overview.htm |access-date= 11 March 2020}}</ref>\n\n===Even higher oxygen affinity \u2013 hemoglobin Barts (four \u03b3 subunits)===\n[[Hemoglobin Barts]] is an abnormal form of hemoglobin produced in hemoglobin Barts syndrome or alpha-thalassemia major, the most severe form of [[alpha-thalassemia]].

As a consequence, less hemoglobin is available and this affects oxygen supply to the tissues. \nHemoglobin Barts syndrome manifests when all four genes coding for \u03b1 subunit are deleted. This is often fatal for the fetus carrying the disorder, as in the absence of \u03b1 subunits, a form of hemoglobin with four \u03b3 subunits, hemoglobin Barts, is produced. This form of hemoglobin isn\u2019t fit for oxygen exchange precisely due to its very high affinity for oxygen.  While hemoglobin Barts is very efficient at binding oxygen, it doesn\u2019t release oxygen to the organs and tissues.<ref name=\"Bernard2013 \"> {{cite journal  | authors= Forget B and Bunn H|title= Classification of the Disorders of Hemoglobin |journal= Cold Spring Harbor Perspectives in Medicine|volume= 3 |date= 2013|doi= 10.1101/cshperspect.a011684}}</ref> The disease is fatal for the fetus or newborn unless early diagnosis and intervention is carried out during pregnancy, and the child will be dependent on lifelong blood transfusions. \n\n===Quantification of oxygen binding=== \nTo quantify how strongly a certain type of hemoglobin binds to oxygen (or its affinity for oxygen), a parameter called P50 is often used. In a given situation, P50 can be understood as the minimum concentration of oxygen needed for 50% of the hemoglobin molecules to bind to it.<ref name=\"Vibhu2006\">{{Cite book | authors= Awasthi V, Goins E and Phillips W| title= Blood Substitutes| year=2006 | chapter=Chapter 43 \u2013 Liposome-encapsulated hemoglobin: history, preparation and evaluation | publisher=Academic press| isbn = 978-0-12-759760-7}}</ref> For example, Hemoglobin F has a lower P50 than hemoglobin A. This means that if we have the same amount of hemoglobin F and hemoglobin A in the blood and add oxygen to it, half of hemoglobin F will bind to oxygen before half of hemoglobin A manages to do so. Therefore, a lower P50 means stronger binding or higher affinity for oxygen. \n\nFor reference, the P50 of fetal hemoglobin is roughly 19 mmHg (a measure of pressure), whereas adult hemoglobin is approximately 26.8 mmHg (see [[Blood gas tension]]).<ref name=\"Yacov2017\">  {{Cite book | authors= Yacov R, Derek K and Namasivayam A| title= Assisted Ventilation of the Neonate (sixth edition)| year=2017 | chapter=Chapter 10 \u2013 Blood gases: technical aspects and interpretation | publisher=Elsevier| isbn = 978-0-323-39006-4 }}</ref>\n\n==Oxygen exchange in the womb==\nDuring pregnancy, the mother\u2019s circulatory system delivers oxygen and nutrients to the fetus and carries away nutrient-depleted blood enriched with carbon dioxide.

Firstly, the presence of hemoglobin F in the fetus allows a stronger binding to oxygen than maternal hemoglobin (see section ''Why hemoglobin F has high oxygen affinity''). Secondly, the mother\u2019s bloodstream is richer in oxygen that the fetus\u2019, so oxygen naturally flows towards the fetal circulation by diffusion.<ref name=\"Metcalfe1967\">{{cite journal | authors=Metcalfe J, Bartels H and Moll W |title= Gas exchange in the pregnant uterus.  |journal= Physiological reviews |volume=47 |issue=4 |pages=782-838 |date=1967 |doi= 10.1152/physrev.1967.47.4.782 }}</ref> The final factor is related to the effects of pH on maternal and fetal hemoglobin. As the maternal blood acquires more carbon dioxide, it becomes more acidic and this favours the release of oxygen by the maternal hemoglobin. At the same time, the decrease in carbon dioxide in fetal blood makes it more alkaline and favours the uptake of oxygen. This is called the Bohr effect or [[Haldane effect]], which also happens in the air exchange in the lungs.<ref name=\"Sarah2015\">{{cite journal | authors=Griffiths S and Campbell J |title= Placental structure, function and drug transfer |journal= Continuing Education in Anaesthesia Critical Care & Pain |volume=15 |issue=2 |pages=84-89 |date=2015 |doi= 10.1093/bjaceaccp/mku013}} </ref> All of these 3 factors are present simultaneously and cooperate to improve the fetus\u2019 access to oxygen from the mother.\n\n==F-cells==\nF-cells are the subpopulation of red blood cells that contain hemoglobin F, in amongst other types of hemoglobin.

Thus, the key feature that allows hemoglobin F to bind more strongly to oxygen is by having \u03b3 subunits (instead of \u03b2, for example). In fact, some naturally existing molecules in our body can bind to hemoglobin and change its binding affinity for oxygen. One of the molecules is [[2,3-bisphosphoglycerate|2,3-bisphosphoglycerate (2,3-BPG)]] and it enhances hemoglobin\u2019s ability to release oxygen.<ref name=\"Gerald 2018\">{{Cite book | authors= Litwack G| title= Human Biochemistry | year=2018 | chapter=Chapter 8 \u2013 Glycolysis and Glocuneogenesis | publisher=Academic press| isbn = 978-0-12-383864-3}}</ref> 2,3-BPG interacts much more with hemoglobin A than hemoglobin F. This is because the adult \u03b2 subunit has more positive charges than the fetal \u03b3 subunit, which attract the negative charges from 2,3-BPG.

This is often fatal for the fetus carrying the disorder, as in the absence of \u03b1 subunits, a form of hemoglobin with four \u03b3 subunits, hemoglobin Barts, is produced. This form of hemoglobin isn\u2019t fit for oxygen exchange precisely due to its very high affinity for oxygen.

Firstly, the presence of hemoglobin F in the fetus allows a stronger binding to oxygen than maternal hemoglobin (see section ''Why hemoglobin F has high oxygen affinity'').

Anyone can use this restroom, regardless of gender identity or expression\".]]\n{{Transgender sidebar}}\nThe term '''unisex public toilets''', also called '''gender-inclusive''', '''gender-neutral''' and '''mixed-sex''' or '''all-gender toilets, bathrooms or restrooms''', refers to [[public toilets]] that are not separated by [[gender]] or [[sex]]. Unisex public toilets can benefit a range of people with or without special needs, for example [[Disability|people with disabilities]], the elderly, and anyone who needs the help of someone of another [[gender or sex]].  They are also valuable for parents wishing to accompany one or more of their young children needing a toilet facility. While the push for gender neutral bathrooms benefits a number of different demographics, it is driven by the transgender community to combat harassment and violence against these populations. <ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.tolerance.org/magazine/transgender-bathroom-laws-history|title=Trans Rights and Bathroom Access Laws: A History Explained|date=2018-10-16|website=Teaching Tolerance|language=en|access-date=2020-03-30}}</ref> \n\nUnisex public toilets take different forms. They may be single occupancy facilities where only one single room or enclosure is provided, or multi-user facilities which are open to all and where users may either share sinks in an open area or each have their own sink in their private cubicle, stall or room. Unisex public toilets may either replace single-sex toilets or may be an addition to single-sex toilets.\n\nUnisex public toilets can be used by people of any sex, gender or [[gender identity]], i.e. [[male]], [[female]], [[transgender]], [[intersex]]. Such toilet facilities can benefit [[transgender]] populations and people outside of the [[gender binary]]. Sex-separation in public toilets (also called [[sex segregation]]), as opposed to unisex toilets, is the separation of [[public toilets]] into male and female. This separation is sometimes enforced by local laws and building codes.  Key differences between male and female public toilets in most western countries include the presence of [[urinals]] for men and boys, and sanitary bins for the disposal of [[Feminine hygiene|menstrual hygiene products]] for women and girls. Sanitary bins may easily be included in the setup of unisex public toilets; however, urinals are of no use to women and girls and are therefore a single-sex facility.\n\nThe historical purposes of sex-separated toilets in the United States and Europe, as well as the timing of their appearance, are disputed amongst scholars. Safety from [[sexual harassment]] and privacy were likely two main goals of sex-separation of public toilets, and factors such as [[morality]] also played roles.<ref name=\"Carter\">{{cite journal|last=Carter|first=W.

Sex is a term used to describe biological characteristics of a person, being male, female, or intersex. Gender is a term used to describe a person's identification based on a broad set of attributes, being man, woman, or a long list of identifications outside this binary. <ref>{{Cite web|url=https://cooper.edu/about/news/bathroom-confidential|title=Bathroom Confidential {{!}} The Cooper Union|website=cooper.edu|access-date=2020-03-30}}</ref>  \n{{TOC limit|3}}\n\n==Terminology==\n[[File:\u3060\u308c\u3067\u3082\u30c8\u30a4\u30ec at municipal community center in Shibuya, Tokyo.jpg|thumb|\"Toilets for anyone\" in Japan]]\nSeveral alternative terms are in use for unisex public toilets.

To ensure visual privacy, these may be provided with floor-to-ceiling walls.<ref name=\"Sanders\">Sanders, J., & Stryker, S. (2016). Stalled: Gender-neutral public bathrooms.

Springer, Cham {{doi|10.1007/978-3-319-29623-4_32}}</ref><ref name=\"Sanders\"/> Alternatively, a sink can be provided in each cubicle or toilet room, e.g. where the unisex toilet is set up to be used by families and carers.\n\n=== Urinals ===\n\nThe issue of urinals is creating somewhat of a conundrum for many unisex  public toilet designers. In many public toilets, the widespread use of urinals for males means that there are more opportunities to meet their needs. There are often queues in front of the toilet rooms for females but not in front of the toilet rooms for males. While toilets are usually located in cubicles with lockable doors, urinals are usually installed freely in rows in sex-separated toilet rooms. This construction leads to a smaller space consumption and thus to more possibilities for water-efficient urination, while promoting more sanitary restroom conditions for men/boys at work/school and elsewhere.\n\nUrinals have primarily been offered in public toilets for males, with [[female urinal]]s being only a niche product so far. Abolishing all urinals would sacrifice resource advantages and convenience for male users, without improving sanitation or wait time for females. Another possibility would be to offer separate male and female urinals or unisex urinals that can be used by males and females alike, which allows increased flexibility of use. Yet this would raise the problem of arrangement.  One option would be to continue to offer urinals in rows, with separation by screens. However, it is questionable whether the less private environment, compared to cubicle toilets, would be met with acceptance. Due to socio-cultural conventions, the concept of men/boys urinating with their backs visible to women/girls would possibly create awkwardness for both genders, and would currently seem strange and contrary to common morals and etiquette for many users. \n\nThere are even more practical issues for females, such as women/girls needing toilet paper, having to lower their pants, and sometimes tending to their menstrual hygiene needs while going to the toilet for urination.  An alternative would be to accommodate urinals for both sexes in cubicles or to continue to offer them only in public toilets for males. However, this would at least limit the above-mentioned advantages of urinals.<ref>{{cite web|last=Earlywine |first=Kyle |url=http://greenflushrestrooms.com/womens-opinions-on-urinals |title=What Women Think About Urinals |work=Greenflushrestrooms.com |date=December 15, 2015 |accessdate=January 28, 2019}}</ref>\n\nUrinals arranged in cubicles have rarely been installed; the advantages over conventional toilets were not obvious because the same space would still be required in the new arrangement. With all things considered, many unisex public toilet designers are now creating plans in which urinals would be constructed in an isolated section or corner of the toilet room, so that they would not be directly visible to anyone in other areas of the public toilet. This is seen by many  public toilet designers as the best possible solution that would balance efficiency with modesty.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.nydailynews.com/life-style/unisex-bathrooms-eliminate-long-restroom-lines-women-article-1.3332829|title=Unisex bathrooms may eliminate long restroom lines for women|last=Scotti|first=Ariel|website=nydailynews.com|access-date=2019-04-29}}</ref>\n\n=== Building-related advantages ===\n{{multiple image\n| align = right\n| image1 = W7 series set W4 Green car toilet 20150314.jpg\n| width1 = 260\n| alt1 = \n| caption1 = \n| image2 = Tobu 500 series toilet-03.jpg\n| width2 = 130\n| alt2 = \n| caption2 = \n| footer = Unisex toilet with urinal in a Japanese [[Shinkansen]] express train.\n}}\nEspecially where space is limited, the double design of the sanitary facilities is not possible or only possible to a limited extent.

Also, where public toilets are located are sometimes dictated by existing plumbing design. If the only way to build unisex public toilets is to locate them in isolated spaces a long way from persons in charge of supervising the space, such a design may be objectionable on safety grounds. Some argue that laws requiring that women and men be treated the same in public toilet access is unfair. Since the 1980s, \"[[potty parity]]\" activists campaigned for laws requiring more female-designated public toilets than male-designated public toilets in public buildings, based on the idea that women require more time to use the toilet and thus women's toilets tend to have longer lines.<ref name=\"PHLUSH2\">{{cite web|url=http://www.phlush.org/2016/08/31/social-inclusion-toilet-rights-and-legal-protection-for-transgender-americans/|title=Social inclusion, toilet rights, and legal protection for transgender Americans|access-date=March 4, 2017}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=http://articles.latimes.com/2001/jan/14/news/cl-12081|title=Is 'Potty Parity' Just a Pipe Dream?|last=HALL|first=CARLA|date=January 14, 2001|work=Los Angeles Times|access-date=March 4, 2017|language=en-US|issn=0458-3035}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.csmonitor.com/2006/0119/p16s01-lihc.html|title=\"Potty parity\" aims to remedy long lines|last=Bradley|first=Matt|date=January 19, 2006|work=Christian Science Monitor|access-date=March 4, 2017|issn=0882-7729}}</ref> California passed the first law of this kind in 1987, and as of 2009 twenty states in the US have passed similar legislation.<ref name=\"PHLUSH2\" />\n\n==Locations ==\n{{multiple image | align = right | direction = horizontal\n | header = [[AIGA]] standard restroom symbols\n | image1 = Aiga toiletsq men.svg | width1 = 85 | caption1  = Men's\n | image2 = Toilet women.svg | width2 = 65 | caption2  = Women's\n | image3 = Toilets unisex.svg | width3 = 130 | caption3 = Unisex\n }}\n\n===At private companies===\nUnless otherwise prohibited by law (and when required by law), private companies can  provide unisex toilets.

It has been stated that it was only in the nineteenth century, with increasingly strict prohibitions on bodily display and the emergence of a rigid ideology of gender, that visual privacy and the spatial separation of the sexes were introduced into public toilet design.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Penner |first=Barbara |year=2001 |title=A world of unmentionable suffering: Women's public conveniences in Victorian London |journal=Journal of Design History |volume=14 |issue=1 |pages=35\u201351 |doi=10.1093/jdh/14.1.35 |pmid=20037960 |url=https://semanticscholar.org/paper/53f32acaff71b4f7d79dc00198694fb02e9a2c14 }}</ref>\n\nIt has been claimed that the earliest example of a sex-separated public toilet occurred in [[Paris]] (France) in 1739 at a ball.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.livescience.com/54692-why-bathrooms-are-gender-segregated.html|title=The Weird History of Gender-Segregated Bathroomswork=Live Science|access-date=April 23, 2017}}</ref> \n\n=== Western sex-separation as pre-modern ===\n\nUnder another view, offered by W. Burlette Carter, sex-separation has long been the standard in the U.S. and Great Britain and most of the world where women's well-being was valued.<ref name=\"Carter\"/> She argues that when people used [[chamber pot]]s, sex-separation could be achieved by placing the pot in a separated space. In single-use privies and similar spaces, that separation was achieved by allowing only one \"sex\" to use the space at a time.<ref name=Carter/>{{rp|295}} In multi-use spaces, it was achieved either through the same means or by separate spaces for the sexes. Very likely, the primary reasons for establishing these sex-separated spaces were safety and privacy for women and children.<ref name=\"Carter\" /> Concerns over undesired pregnancy and procreation were additional considerations. Some of these were related to concerns about rape or about moral views about how and when women should become pregnant (e.g., objections to [[premarital sex]]). Evidence also suggest that, in earlier centuries, when people sought to create unisex spaces for those who wanted or needed them, authorities resisted.<ref name=Carter/>{{rp|263\u201364}}\n\nOne scholar claims that toilet separation by sex preceded 1739, and that in fact sex separated toilets have been a feature in multi-use spaces since their beginnings.<ref name=\"Carter\" />{{rp|254\u2013267, 292\u201394}}  They argue that, prior to the 1887 Massachusetts statute, across the United States and Europe at least, sex-separation was the norm already.<ref name=Carter/>{{rp|258}} For example, Massachusetts had statewide regulations that required sex-separation in particular venues such as schools before 1887.<ref name=Carter/>{{rp|278}}  The earliest written reference to sex-separation in the United States may be from 1786. A traveler described bathers using a public spring called Healing Springs, in South Carolina. The bathers would hang Aprons from a tree to mark when the women were bathing and used Hats to mark when the men were bathing. Within the culture of that time, this practice was tantamount to hanging \"women\" and \"men\" signs.<ref name=Carter/>{{rp|268\u201369}} Furthermore, ancient evidence, including art-work, confirms widespread use of sex-separation (or [[sex segregation]]), especially in multi-use spaces - therefore not limiting the concept to public toilets. The exceptions were where the spaces were intended for amorous purposes by opposite sex couples, where safety was considered not to be at risk, or where women were not valued by society.<ref name=Carter/>{{rp|260\u2013261}}\n\n=== Primary rationales of sex-separation ===\nOne theory argues there were four primary rationales for [[Sex segregation|sex-segregated]] toilets as detailed by state statutes and related literature in the nineteenth century: sanitation, women's privacy, the protection of women's bodies, which were seen as weaker, and to protect social morality especially as it pertained to the nineteenth century ideology of [[separate spheres]].<ref name=\"Kogan\" /><ref name=\":0\">{{cite journal|last=Herman|first=Jody|date=June 2013|title=Gendered Restrooms and Minority Stress: The Public Regulation of Gender and Its Impact on Transgender People's Lives|url=http://williamsinstitute.law.ucla.edu/wp-content/uploads/Herman-Gendered-Restrooms-and-Minority-Stress-June-2013.pdf|journal=Journal of Public Management & Social Policy|volume=19|issue=1|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161122015434/http://williamsinstitute.law.ucla.edu/wp-content/uploads/Herman-Gendered-Restrooms-and-Minority-Stress-June-2013.pdf|archivedate=November 22, 2016}}</ref><ref name=\":4\">Massachusetts (State).

Unisex public toilets can benefit a range of people with or without special needs, for example [[Disability|people with disabilities]], the elderly, and anyone who needs the help of someone of another [[gender or sex]].  They are also valuable for parents wishing to accompany one or more of their young children needing a toilet facility. While the push for gender neutral bathrooms benefits a number of different demographics, it is driven by the transgender community to combat harassment and violence against these populations. <ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.tolerance.org/magazine/transgender-bathroom-laws-history|title=Trans Rights and Bathroom Access Laws: A History Explained|date=2018-10-16|website=Teaching Tolerance|language=en|access-date=2020-03-30}}</ref> \n\nUnisex public toilets take different forms. They may be single occupancy facilities where only one single room or enclosure is provided, or multi-user facilities which are open to all and where users may either share sinks in an open area or each have their own sink in their private cubicle, stall or room. Unisex public toilets may either replace single-sex toilets or may be an addition to single-sex toilets.\n\nUnisex public toilets can be used by people of any sex, gender or [[gender identity]], i.e. [[male]], [[female]], [[transgender]], [[intersex]]. Such toilet facilities can benefit [[transgender]] populations and people outside of the [[gender binary]]. Sex-separation in public toilets (also called [[sex segregation]]), as opposed to unisex toilets, is the separation of [[public toilets]] into male and female. This separation is sometimes enforced by local laws and building codes.  Key differences between male and female public toilets in most western countries include the presence of [[urinals]] for men and boys, and sanitary bins for the disposal of [[Feminine hygiene|menstrual hygiene products]] for women and girls. Sanitary bins may easily be included in the setup of unisex public toilets.\n\nThe historical purposes of sex-separated toilets in the United States and Europe, as well as the timing of their appearance, are disputed amongst scholars. Safety from [[sexual harassment]] and privacy were likely two main goals of sex-separation of public toilets, and factors such as [[morality]] also played roles.<ref name=\"Carter\">{{cite journal|last=Carter|first=W.

To ensure visual privacy, these may be provided with floor-to-ceiling walls.<ref name=\"Sanders\">Sanders, J., & Stryker, S. (2016). Stalled: Gender-neutral public bathrooms. South Atlantic Quarterly, 115(4), 779-788 {{doi|10.1215/00382876-3656191}}</ref>\n\n=== Sinks ===\nSinks are commonly installed in open arrangement as in sex-segregated toilets and used collectively by people of all gender.<ref>Huesmann, M. (2016). Transgressing Gender Binarism in the Workplace? Including Transgender and Intersexuality Perspectives in Organizational Restroom Policies.

Springer, Cham {{doi|10.1007/978-3-319-29623-4_32}}</ref><ref name=\"Sanders\"/> Alternatively, a sink can be provided in each cubicle or toilet room, e.g. where the unisex toilet is set up to be used by families and carers.\n\n=== Urinals ===\n\nThe issue of urinals is creating somewhat of a conundrum for many unisex  public toilet designers. In many public toilets, the widespread use of urinals for males means that there are more opportunities to meet their needs. There are often queues in front of the toilet rooms for females but not in front of the toilet rooms for males. While toilets are usually located in cubicles with lockable doors, urinals are usually installed freely in rows in sex-separated toilet rooms. This construction leads to a smaller space consumption and thus to more possibilities for water-efficient urination, while promoting more sanitary restroom conditions for men/boys at work/school and elsewhere.\n\nUrinals have primarily been offered in public toilets for males, with [[female urinal]]s being only a niche product so far. Abolishing all urinals would sacrifice resource advantages and convenience for male users, without improving sanitation or wait time for females. Another possibility would be to offer separate male and female urinals or unisex urinals that can be used by males and females alike, which allows increased flexibility of use. Yet this would raise the problem of arrangement.  One option would be to continue to offer urinals in rows, with separation by screens. However, it is questionable whether the less private environment, compared to cubicle toilets, would be met with acceptance. Due to socio-cultural conventions, the concept of men/boys urinating with their backs visible to women/girls would possibly create awkwardness for both genders, and would currently seem strange and contrary to common morals and etiquette for many users. \n\nThere are even more practical issues for females, such as women/girls needing toilet paper, having to lower their pants, and sometimes tending to their menstrual hygiene needs while going to the toilet for urination.  An alternative would be to accommodate urinals for both sexes in cubicles or to continue to offer them only in public toilets for males. However, this would at least limit the above-mentioned advantages of urinals.<ref>{{cite web|last=Earlywine |first=Kyle |url=http://greenflushrestrooms.com/womens-opinions-on-urinals |title=What Women Think About Urinals |work=Greenflushrestrooms.com |date=December 15, 2015 |accessdate=January 28, 2019}}</ref>\n\nUrinals arranged in cubicles have rarely been installed; the advantages over conventional toilets were not obvious because the same space would still be required in the new arrangement. With all things considered, many unisex public toilet designers are now creating plans in which urinals would be constructed in an isolated section or corner of the toilet room, so that they would not be directly visible to anyone in other areas of the public toilet. This is seen by many  public toilet designers as the best possible solution that would balance efficiency with modesty.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.nydailynews.com/life-style/unisex-bathrooms-eliminate-long-restroom-lines-women-article-1.3332829|title=Unisex bathrooms may eliminate long restroom lines for women|last=Scotti|first=Ariel|website=nydailynews.com|access-date=2019-04-29}}</ref>\n\n=== Building-related advantages ===\n{{multiple image\n| align = right\n| image1 = W7 series set W4 Green car toilet 20150314.jpg\n| width1 = 260\n| alt1 = \n| caption1 = \n| image2 = Tobu 500 series toilet-03.jpg\n| width2 = 130\n| alt2 = \n| caption2 = \n| footer = Unisex toilet with urinal in a Japanese [[Shinkansen]] express train.\n}}\nEspecially where space is limited, the double design of the sanitary facilities is not possible or only possible to a limited extent.

Also, where public toilets are located are sometimes dictated by existing plumbing design. If the only way to build unisex public toilets is to locate them in isolated spaces a long way from persons in charge of supervising the space, such a design may be objectionable on safety grounds. Some argue that laws requiring that women and men be treated the same in public toilet access is unfair. Since the 1980s, \"[[potty parity]]\" activists campaigned for laws requiring more female-designated public toilets than male-designated public toilets in public buildings, based on the idea that women require more time to use the toilet and thus women's toilets tend to have longer lines.<ref name=\"PHLUSH2\">{{cite web|url=http://www.phlush.org/2016/08/31/social-inclusion-toilet-rights-and-legal-protection-for-transgender-americans/|title=Social inclusion, toilet rights, and legal protection for transgender Americans|access-date=March 4, 2017}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=http://articles.latimes.com/2001/jan/14/news/cl-12081|title=Is 'Potty Parity' Just a Pipe Dream?|last=HALL|first=CARLA|date=January 14, 2001|work=Los Angeles Times|access-date=March 4, 2017|language=en-US|issn=0458-3035}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.csmonitor.com/2006/0119/p16s01-lihc.html|title=\"Potty parity\" aims to remedy long lines|last=Bradley|first=Matt|date=January 19, 2006|work=Christian Science Monitor|access-date=March 4, 2017|issn=0882-7729}}</ref> California passed the first law of this kind in 1987, and as of 2009 twenty states in the US have passed similar legislation.<ref name=\"PHLUSH2\" />\n\n==Locations ==\n{{multiple image | align = right | direction = horizontal\n | header = [[AIGA]] standard restroom symbols\n | image1 = Aiga toiletsq men.svg | width1 = 85 | caption1  = Men's\n | image2 = Toilet women.svg | width2 = 65 | caption2  = Women's\n | image3 = Toilets unisex.svg | width3 = 130 | caption3 = Unisex\n }}\n\n===At private companies===\nUnless otherwise prohibited by law (and when required by law), private companies can  provide unisex toilets.

Evidence also suggest that, in earlier centuries, when people sought to create unisex spaces for those who wanted or needed them, authorities resisted.<ref name=Carter/>{{rp|263\u201364}}\n\nOne scholar claims that toilet separation by sex preceded 1739, and that in fact sex separated toilets have been a feature in multi-use spaces since their beginnings.<ref name=\"Carter\" />{{rp|254\u2013267, 292\u201394}}  They argue that, prior to the 1887 Massachusetts statute, across the United States and Europe at least, sex-separation was the norm already.<ref name=Carter/>{{rp|258}} For example, Massachusetts had statewide regulations that required sex-separation in particular venues such as schools before 1887.<ref name=Carter/>{{rp|278}}  The earliest written reference to sex-separation in the United States may be from 1786. A traveler described bathers using a public spring called Healing Springs, in South Carolina. The bathers would hang Aprons from a tree to mark when the women were bathing and used Hats to mark when the men were bathing. Within the culture of that time, this practice was tantamount to hanging \"women\" and \"men\" signs.<ref name=Carter/>{{rp|268\u201369}} Furthermore, ancient evidence, including art-work, confirms widespread use of sex-separation (or [[sex segregation]]), especially in multi-use spaces - therefore not limiting the concept to public toilets. The exceptions were where the spaces were intended for amorous purposes by opposite sex couples, where safety was considered not to be at risk, or where women were not valued by society.<ref name=Carter/>{{rp|260\u2013261}}\n\n=== Primary rationales of sex-separation ===\nOne theory argues there were four primary rationales for [[Sex segregation|sex-segregated]] toilets as detailed by state statutes and related literature in the nineteenth century: sanitation, women's privacy, the protection of women's bodies, which were seen as weaker, and to protect social morality especially as it pertained to the nineteenth century ideology of [[separate spheres]].<ref name=\"Kogan\" /><ref name=\":0\">{{cite journal|last=Herman|first=Jody|date=June 2013|title=Gendered Restrooms and Minority Stress: The Public Regulation of Gender and Its Impact on Transgender People's Lives|url=http://williamsinstitute.law.ucla.edu/wp-content/uploads/Herman-Gendered-Restrooms-and-Minority-Stress-June-2013.pdf|journal=Journal of Public Management & Social Policy|volume=19|issue=1|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161122015434/http://williamsinstitute.law.ucla.edu/wp-content/uploads/Herman-Gendered-Restrooms-and-Minority-Stress-June-2013.pdf|archivedate=November 22, 2016}}</ref><ref name=\":4\">Massachusetts (State).
