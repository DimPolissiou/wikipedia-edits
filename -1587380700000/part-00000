Like most of its relatives, it is a strongly [[isolating language]] with [[subject\u2013object\u2013verb]] word order, and a set of [[measure word|numeral classifiers]]. There are seven [[Tone (linguistics)|tones]], and consonants cannot close syllables. The language spoken by the Lahu Shi is notably divergent from that spoken by the other groups. In Thailand, Lahu Na often serves as a [[lingua franca]] among the various hill tribes.  Written Lahu uses the [[Latin alphabet]].  Among Christian villages, the language has been enriched by loanwords from English, Latin and Greek via Bible translation, plus [[neologism]]s in the areas of hygiene, music and education.<ref | name = Lexicon />\n\n==Religion==\n[[File:Elderly Lahu woman.jpg|thumb|An elderly Lahu woman at a refugee camp in Thailand]]\n\nThe traditional Lahu religion is [[polytheistic]]. Buddhism was introduced in the late 17th century and became widespread. Many Lahu people in China are Buddhists.<ref name=\"The Lahu Ethnic Group\" /> Christianity became established in Burma in the 19th century and has been spreading since.\n\nThe Lahu of Northeastern Thailand had encounters with Theravada Buddhist [[Thai Forest Tradition|forest monks (tudong monks)]] around the years 1930\u20131940. The leader of such a group of monks, [[Mun Bhuridatta]], spent some time in Lahu territory. These Lahu asked him for a \"[[gatha]] that would protect them from ghosts and demons.\"<ref>Forest Recollections, K. Tyavanich, Honolulu 1997, p.&nbsp;163.</ref>\n\n==Names==\nLahu people used to have just a given name, until the [[Government of China|Chinese Government]] gave them surnames. About 90% of the Lahu people are either named Lee or Zhang, two of the most common Chinese surnames. Lahu given names are made of two syllables: one that shows the gender and one that gives information on the day of birth, based on the zodiac. For example, a person born on the [[Ox (zodiac)|Ox]] day will be named \u201cZanu\u201d if he is a boy and \u201cNanu\u201d if she is a girl.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://blog-en.namepedia.org/2015/03/lahu-names-china/|title=namepedia blog - All about names, without the gloves|website=Blog-en.namepedia.org|date=13 March 2015|accessdate=17 August 2018}}</ref>\n\n==See also==\n* ''[[The Art of Not Being Governed]]''\n\n== Notes ==\n{{NoteFoot}}\n\n== References ==\n=== Citations ===\n{{Reflist}}\n\n=== Sources ===\n{{refbegin}}\n* {{cite book\n | last       = Bradley\n | first      = David\n | author-link = David Bradley (linguist)\n | year       = 1979\n | title      = Lahu dialects\n | series     = Oriental monograph series #23\n | location   = Canberra, ACT\n | publisher  = Faculty of Asian Studies, Australian National University\n | oclc      = 6303582\n}}\n* {{cite book\n | last1 = Lewis\n | first1 = Paul\n | last2 = Lewis\n | first2 = Elaine\n | year = 1984\n | title = Peoples of the Golden Triangle\n | url = https://archive.org/details/peoplesofgoldent0000lewi\n | url-access = registration\n | publisher = Thames and Hudson Ltd.\n | location = London, England\n | isbn = 0-500-97472-1\n}}\n* {{cite book\n | last = Matisoff\n | first = James\n | year = 1982\n | title = The Grammar of Lahu\n | publisher = University of California Press\n | location = Berkeley, California\n | isbn = 0-520-09467-0\n}}\n* Ph\u1ea1m Huy. 1997.

Like most of its relatives, it is a strongly [[isolating language]] with [[subject\u2013object\u2013verb]] word order, and a set of [[measure word|numeral classifiers]]. There are seven [[Tone (linguistics)|tones]], and consonants cannot close syllables. The language spoken by the Lahu Shi is notably divergent from that spoken by the other groups. In Thailand, Lahu Na often serves as a [[lingua franca]] among the various hill tribes.  Written Lahu uses the [[Latin alphabet]].

Many Lahu people in China are Buddhists.<ref name=\"The Lahu Ethnic Group\" /> Christianity became established in Burma in the 19th century and has been spreading since.\n\nThe Lahu of Northeastern Thailand had encounters with Theravada Buddhist [[Thai Forest Tradition|forest monks (tudong monks)]] around the years 1930\u20131940. The leader of such a group of monks, [[Mun Bhuridatta]], spent some time in Lahu territory.

About 90% of the Lahu people are either named Lee or Zhang, two of the most common Chinese surnames. Lahu given names are made of two syllables: one that shows the gender and one that gives information on the day of birth, based on the zodiac. For example, a person born on the [[Ox (zodiac)|Ox]] day will be named \u201cZanu\u201d if he is a boy and \u201cNanu\u201d if she is a girl.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://blog-en.namepedia.org/2015/03/lahu-names-china/|title=namepedia blog - All about names, without the gloves|website=Blog-en.namepedia.org|date=13 March 2015|accessdate=17 August 2018}}</ref>\n\n==See also==\n* [[The Art of Not Being Governed]]\n\n== Notes ==\n{{NoteFoot}}\n\n== References ==\n=== Citations ===\n{{Reflist}}\n\n=== Sources ===\n{{refbegin}}\n* {{cite book\n | last       = Bradley\n | first      = David\n | author-link = David Bradley (linguist)\n | year       = 1979\n | title      = Lahu dialects\n | series     = Oriental monograph series #23\n | location   = Canberra, ACT\n | publisher  = Faculty of Asian Studies, Australian National University\n | oclc      = 6303582\n}}\n* {{cite book\n | last1 = Lewis\n | first1 = Paul\n | last2 = Lewis\n | first2 = Elaine\n | year = 1984\n | title = Peoples of the Golden Triangle\n | url = https://archive.org/details/peoplesofgoldent0000lewi\n | url-access = registration\n | publisher = Thames and Hudson Ltd.\n | location = London, England\n | isbn = 0-500-97472-1\n}}\n* {{cite book\n | last = Matisoff\n | first = James\n | year = 1982\n | title = The Grammar of Lahu\n | publisher = University of California Press\n | location = Berkeley, California\n | isbn = 0-520-09467-0\n}}\n* Ph\u1ea1m Huy. 1997.

The mountain lies southwest of the [[Chang Peak]] [[caldera]] and is largely covered with snow and [[glacier]]s, but there are rock exposures on the south and southwestern slopes. The volcano may have been active as late as the [[Holocene]], with [[tephra]] layers recovered from [[ice core]]s possibly originating from Mount Waesche. [[Seismic activity]] has been recorded both from the volcano and from an area south of it and might reflect ongoing volcanic activity.\n\n== Name ==\n\nThe volcano is named for V.

It is one of 18 volcanoes in that region, which were active from the [[Oligocene]] to recent times.
