Having observed the side effect of sleepiness after a lesion was produced on the hypothalamus, Bremer was curious as to what the effects of a lesion farther down would do. He decided to test his hypothesis by adapting a technique of decerebration in cats, that left the forebrain ''[[in situ]]'' after a mesencephalic [[transection]], and applying it to the intercollicular section. While the transection was not a directly planned investigation of sleep, but the results influenced his future research career very heavily.<ref name=\"Bremer\">{{cite journal|last=Bremer|first=F|title=Existence of a mutual tonic inhibitory interaction between the preoptic hypnogenic structure and the midbrain reticular formation|journal=Brain Res|year=1975|volume=96|pages=71\u201375|doi=10.1016/0006-8993(75)90573-9}}</ref>\n\nBremer started his brain transection experiments at an opportune time. Neurophysiological techniques had greatly improved during the early 1930s with the introduction of Alex Forbes' electronic amplification. [[Electromagnetic oscillograph]]s had\nreplaced the Lippman electrometer and the string galvanometer in electrophysiological experiments. These newly introduced techniques allowed Lord Adrian and Matthews to confirm Hans Bergers revolutionary discovery of alpha electroencephalographic\nactivity in humans.<ref name=\"Bremer\"/>\n\nWith these advances in technology Bremer was able to start his transection experiments on cats, and accurately record the resulting brain function. His first procedure was to make a transection in the midbrain, the results were dramatic. The transection had deprived the brain of the ascending sensory impulses, except the olfaction and optical, and in so doing had caused a state identical to barbiturate sleep. This state was persistent as well as indefinite. This result lead Bremer to formulate the hypotheses that the immediate cause of sleep was a complete deprivation of sensory input from the impulses of the spine.\n\nIn order to further evaluate his deafferation \"sleep hypothesis\", Bremer conducted a second experiment in which he made a transection at a much lower level- just above where the brain stem and spinal cord meet. He termed this procedure the enc\u00e9phale isol\u00e9, with this procedure he deprived the brain of all sensory input from the spine, but left all input from the cranial nerve intact. These results were very different from the midbrain transection. In contrast to the perpetual sleep state, the lower transection simply caused and alteration of sleep and wake cycle that was not different from a regular cat. This strengthened his belief in his hypothesis. Although unaware of the [[reticular activating system]], discovered 14 years later by [[Giuseppe Moruzzi]] and [[Horace Magoun]], Bremer attributed the sleep-wake cycle to the effects of sensory input to the brain. He concluded that sleep is simply a manifestation of a decrease in cortical \"tone\". The tone is maintained by the continuous flux of sensory information to the brain.<ref name=\"Bremer\"/>\n\n==Batini's disproving==\n\nAnother research in the field of sleep, Batini, questioned Bremer's hypothesis and did an experiment similar to Bremers'. In 1939 Batini's experiment performed his experiment in which  he stimulated of different areas of the reticular activating system, and his results concluded that sleep is not dependent on an influx or lack of stimulus from the body. Our bodies do not require input to have or maintain evidence of being awake.\n\n==Summary==\n\nAlthough Bremer's hypothesis was ultimately proved flawed, he was still one of pioneers of neurophysiology. Through his work he inspired many to investigate more into the brain, which lead to the discovery of much of what we know now about the anatomy of the human brain and its functions. Bremer also followed up on his research in sleep and did research in things such as the biological clock.

Their stripes come in different patterns, unique to each individual. They are generally social animals that live in small [[Harem (zoology)|harems]] to large [[herd]]s. Unlike their closest relatives, [[horse]]s and [[donkey]]s, zebras have never been truly [[domesticated]].\n\nThere are three species of zebras: the [[plains zebra]], the [[mountain zebra]] and the [[Gr\u00e9vy's zebra]]. The plains zebra and the mountain zebra belong to the subgenus ''[[Hippotigris]]'', while Gr\u00e9vy's zebra is the sole species of subgenus ''Dolichohippus''. The latter resembles an [[Asinus|ass]], to which zebras are closely related, while the former two look more horse-like. All three belong to the genus ''Equus'', along with other living equids.\n\nThe unique stripes of zebras make them one of the animals most familiar to people. They occur in a variety of habitats, such as [[grassland]]s, [[savanna]]s, [[woodland]]s, thorny [[scrubland]]s, [[mountain]]s, and coastal [[hill]]s. Various anthropogenic factors have had a severe impact on zebra populations, in particular hunting for skins and [[habitat destruction]]. Gr\u00e9vy's zebra and the mountain zebra are endangered.

Their social structure, however, depends on the species. [[Mountain zebra]]s and plains zebras live in groups, known as 'harems', consisting of one stallion with up to six mares and their foals. Bachelor males either live alone or with groups of other bachelors until they are old enough to challenge a breeding stallion. When attacked by packs of [[hyena]]s or [[African wild dog|wild dogs]] a zebra group will huddle together with the foals in the middle while the stallion tries to ward them off.\n\nUnlike the other zebra species, Gr\u00e9vy's zebras do not have permanent social bonds. A group of these zebras rarely stays together for more than a few months. The foals stay with their mothers, while adult males live alone. Like the other two zebra species, bachelor male zebras will organize in groups.\n\nLike horses, zebras sleep standing up, and only sleep when neighbors are around to warn them of predators.\n\n===Communication===\n[[File:Equus quagga boehmi (grazing).jpg|thumb|right|220px|Zebra feeding on grass]]\nZebras communicate with each other with high-pitched barks and whinnying. Gr\u00e9vy's zebras make mulelike brays. A zebra's ears signify its mood. When a zebra is in a calm, tense or friendly mood, its ears stand erect. When it is frightened, its ears are pushed forward. When angry, the ears are pulled backward. When surveying an area for predators, zebras will stand in an alert posture with ears erect, head held high, and staring. When tense, they will also snort. When a predator is spotted or sensed, a zebra will bark (or bray) loudly.\n\n===Food and foraging===\n[[File:Burchell's zebra, Okaukuejo Etosha, Namibia.jpg|thumb|[[Burchell's zebra]] drinking at a waterhole at [[Etosha National Park]]]]\nZebras feed almost entirely on grasses, but may occasionally eat shrubs, herbs, twigs, leaves and bark. Their digestive systems allow them to subsist on diets of lower nutritional quality than that necessary for other herbivores.\n\n===Reproduction===\n{{further|Plains zebra#Reproduction|Gr\u00e9vy's zebra#Reproduction}}\nFemale zebras mature earlier than the males, and a mare may have her first foal by the age of three. Males are not able to breed until the age of five or six. Mares may give birth to one foal every twelve months. She nurses the foal for up to a year. Like horses, zebras are able to stand, walk and suckle shortly after they are born. A zebra foal is brown and white instead of black and white at birth.\n\nPlains and mountain zebra foals are protected by their mothers, as well as the head stallion and the other mares in their group. Gr\u00e9vy's zebra foals have only their mother as a regular protector, since, as noted above, Gr\u00e9vy's zebra groups often disband after a few months.\n\n==Interaction with humans==\n\n===Domestication===\n[[File:WalterRothschildWithZebras.jpg|thumb|left|[[Walter Rothschild, 2nd Baron Rothschild|Lord Rothschild]] with his famed zebra carriage (sp. ''[[Plains zebra|Equus quagga burchellii]]''), which he frequently drove through [[London]]]]\n[[File:Cavallery of German Schutztruppe 1911.jpg|thumb|Cavalry of [[Schutztruppe]] in [[German East Africa]] (1911)]]\n\nAttempts have been made to train zebras for riding, since they have better resistance than horses to African diseases. While occasionally successful, most of these attempts failed due to the zebra's more unpredictable nature and tendency to panic under stress. For this reason, zebra-mules or [[zebroid]]s (crosses between any species of zebra and a horse, pony, donkey or ass) are preferred over purebred zebras. {{citation needed|date=February 2019}}\n\nIn England, the zoological collector [[Walter Rothschild, 2nd Baron Rothschild|Walter Rothschild]] frequently used zebras to draw a carriage. In 1907, [[Rosendo Ribeiro]], the first doctor in Nairobi, Kenya, used a riding zebra for house calls. In the mid-19th century, Governor [[George Grey]] imported zebras to [[New Zealand]] from his previous posting in [[South Africa]], and used them to pull his carriage on his privately owned [[Kawau Island]].\n\n[[File:Zebra-tame-jumping.jpg|thumb|Jumping an obstacle: riding a zebra in East Africa, about 1900]]\nCaptain Horace Hayes, in \"Points of the Horse\" (circa 1893), compared the usefulness of different zebra species. In 1891, Hayes broke a mature, intact mountain zebra stallion to ride in two days' time, and the animal was quiet enough for his wife to ride and be photographed upon. He found the [[Burchell's zebra]] easy to break, and considered it ideal for domestication, as it was immune to the bite of the [[tsetse fly]]. He considered the [[quagga]] (now extinct) well-suited to domestication due to being easy to train to saddle and harness.<ref>Hayes, Capt. Horace (1893), ''[https://archive.org/details/pointsofhorsefam00hayerich Points of the Horse]'', pp. 311\u2013316, London: W. Thacker</ref>\n\n===Conservation===\nHumans have greatly impacted the zebra population. Zebras were, and still are, hunted for their skins and meat. They also compete with livestock for forage<ref name=Competition>{{Cite journal|author=Young, T.P.|title=Competition and compensation among cattle, zebras, and elephants in a semi-arid savanna in Laikipia, Kenya|journal=Biological Conservation |year=2005 |volume=121 |pages=351\u2013359|doi=10.1016/j.biocon.2004.08.007|issue=2|url=http://gepv.univ-lille1.fr/downloads/enseignements/M1-S7/B16-Analyse%20d%27articles/Young%20et%20al.,%202005,%20Biol%20Conservation.pdf|display-authors=etal}}</ref> and are sometimes culled.\n\nThe Cape mountain zebra was hunted to near extinction, with less than 100 individuals by the 1930s. The population has since increased to about 700 due to conservation efforts. Both mountain zebra subspecies are currently protected in national parks, but are still endangered.\n\nThe Gr\u00e9vy's zebra is also endangered. Hunting and competition from livestock have greatly decreased their population. Because of the population's small size, environmental hazards, such as drought, are capable of affecting the entire species. Plains zebras are much more numerous and have a healthy population. Nevertheless, they too have been reduced by hunting and loss of habitat to farming.\n\n===Cultural depictions===\nZebras have been the subject of [[Africa]]n [[Folklore|folk tales]] which tell how they got their stripes. According to a [[San people|San]] folk tale of [[Namibia]], the zebra was once all white, but acquired its black stripes after a fight with a [[baboon]] over a waterhole. After kicking the baboon so hard, the zebra lost his balance and tripped over a fire, and the fire sticks left scorch marks all over his white coat.<ref>{{cite web|url= http://www.gateway-africa.com/stories/How_the_Zebra_Got_his_Stripes_San.html|title= How the Zebra got its stripes.

Their stripes come in different patterns, unique to each individual. They are generally social animals that live in small [[Harem (zoology)|harems]] to large [[herd]]s. Unlike their closest relatives, [[horse]]s and [[donkey]]s, zebras have never been truly [[domesticated]].\n\nThere are three species of zebras: the [[plains zebra]], the [[mountain zebra]] and the [[Gr\u00e9vy's zebra]]. The plains zebra and the mountain zebra belong to the subgenus ''[[Hippotigris]]'', while Gr\u00e9vy's zebra is the sole species of subgenus ''Dolichohippus''. The latter resembles an [[Asinus|ass]], to which zebras are closely related, while the former two look more horse-like. All three belong to the genus ''Equus'', along with other living equids.\n\nThe unique stripes of zebras make them one of the animals most familiar to people. They occur in a variety of habitats, such as [[grassland]]s, [[savanna]]s, [[woodland]]s, thorny [[scrubland]]s, [[mountain]]s, and coastal [[hill]]s. Various anthropogenic factors have had a severe impact on zebra populations, in particular hunting for skins and [[habitat destruction]]. Gr\u00e9vy's zebra and the mountain zebra are endangered. While plains zebras are much more plentiful, one subspecies, the [[quagga]], became extinct in the late 19th century \u2013 though there is currently a plan, called the [[Quagga Project]], that aims to breed zebras that are [[phenotype|phenotypically]] similar to the quagga in a process called [[breeding back]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.cnn.com/2016/01/25/africa/quagga-project-zebra-conservation-extinct-south-africa/index.html|title=Quagga were extinct for 100 years.

They are generally slower than horses, but their great [[endurance|stamina]] helps them outrun predators. When chased, a zebra will zig-zag from side to side, making it more difficult for the predator to attack. When cornered, the zebra will rear up and kick or bite its attacker.\n\n===Senses===\nZebras have excellent eyesight. Like most [[ungulate]]s, the zebra's eyes are on the sides of its head, giving it a wide field of view. Zebras also have [[night vision]], although not as advanced as that of most of their predators.{{Citation needed|date=August 2014}}\n\nZebras have excellent hearing and have larger, rounder ears than horses; like other ungulates, zebras can turn their ears in almost any direction. In addition to superb eyesight and hearing, zebras also have acute [[sense]]s of smell and taste.\n\n===Diseases===\nAs equids, zebras are subject to many of the same common [[infection]]s and [[disease]]s as the domestic [[horse]].\n\n*[[Parasitism|Parasites]]:\n**Equid intestinal roundworms ''parascaris'' sp. and ''[[Strongylus vulgaris]]'' \n**[[Nematode|Roundworms]] of the [[lung]]s\n**[[Botfly]] [[larvae]] in the zebra's [[stomach]]\n**[[Lice]]\n**[[Mange]]\n**[[Tick]]s, which can serve as [[Vector (epidemiology)|vectors]] for other diseases including ''[[Babesia]]''\n*[[Salmonella]] infection of the intestine\n*[[Pneumonia]] and [[Pleurisy|pleuritis]]\n*Acute heart lesions due to [[Stress (psychological)|stress]]\n*[[Tetanus]]\n*[[Anthrax]]\n\nTwo Gr\u00e9vy's zebras were [[poison]]ed in 1995 by leaves from a hybrid red maple tree (''[[Acer rubrum]]'') at the [[St. Louis Zoo]].

Their social structure, however, depends on the species. [[Mountain zebra]]s and plains zebras live in groups, known as 'harems', consisting of one stallion with up to six mares and their foals. Bachelor males either live alone or with groups of other bachelors until they are old enough to challenge a breeding stallion. When attacked by packs of [[hyena]]s or [[African wild dog|wild dogs]] a zebra group will huddle together with the foals in the middle while the stallion tries to ward them off.\n\nUnlike the other zebra species, Gr\u00e9vy's zebras do not have permanent social bonds. A group of these zebras rarely stays together for more than a few months. The foals stay with their mothers, while adult males live alone. Like the other two zebra species, bachelor male zebras will organize in groups.\n\nLike horses, zebras sleep standing up, and only sleep when neighbors are around to warn them of predators.\n\n===Communication===\n[[File:Equus quagga boehmi (grazing).jpg|thumb|right|220px|Zebra feeding on grass]]\nZebras communicate with each other with high-pitched barks and whinnying. Gr\u00e9vy's zebras make mulelike brays. A zebra's ears signify its mood. When a zebra is in a calm, tense or friendly mood, its ears stand erect. When it is frightened, its ears are pushed forward. When angry, the ears are pulled backward. When surveying an area for predators, zebras will stand in an alert posture with ears erect, head held high, and staring. When tense, they will also snort. When a predator is spotted or sensed, a zebra will bark (or bray) loudly.\n\n===Food and foraging===\n[[File:Burchell's zebra, Okaukuejo Etosha, Namibia.jpg|thumb|[[Burchell's zebra]] drinking at a waterhole at [[Etosha National Park]]]]\nZebras feed almost entirely on grasses, but may occasionally eat shrubs, herbs, twigs, leaves and bark. Their digestive systems allow them to subsist on diets of lower nutritional quality than that necessary for other herbivores.\n\n===Reproduction===\n{{further|Plains zebra#Reproduction|Gr\u00e9vy's zebra#Reproduction}}\nFemale zebras mature earlier than the males, and a mare may have her first foal by the age of three. Males are not able to breed until the age of five or six. Mares may give birth to one foal every twelve months. She nurses the foal for up to a year. Like horses, zebras are able to stand, walk and suckle shortly after they are born. A zebra foal is brown and white instead of black and white at birth.\n\nPlains and mountain zebra foals are protected by their mothers, as well as the head stallion and the other mares in their group. Gr\u00e9vy's zebra foals have only their mother as a regular protector, since, as noted above, Gr\u00e9vy's zebra groups often disband after a few months.\n\n==Interaction with humans==\n\n===Domestication===\n[[File:WalterRothschildWithZebras.jpg|thumb|left|[[Walter Rothschild, 2nd Baron Rothschild|Lord Rothschild]] with his famed zebra carriage (sp. ''[[Plains zebra|Equus quagga burchellii]]''), which he frequently drove through [[London]]]]\n[[File:Cavallery of German Schutztruppe 1911.jpg|thumb|Cavalry of [[Schutztruppe]] in [[German East Africa]] (1911)]]\n\nAttempts have been made to train zebras for riding, since they have better resistance than horses to African diseases. While occasionally successful, most of these attempts failed due to the zebra's more unpredictable nature and tendency to panic under stress. For this reason, zebra-mules or [[zebroid]]s (crosses between any species of zebra and a horse, pony, donkey or ass) are preferred over purebred zebras. {{citation needed|date=February 2019}}\n\nIn England, the zoological collector [[Walter Rothschild, 2nd Baron Rothschild|Walter Rothschild]] frequently used zebras to draw a carriage. In 1907, [[Rosendo Ribeiro]], the first doctor in Nairobi, Kenya, used a riding zebra for house calls. In the mid-19th century, Governor [[George Grey]] imported zebras to [[New Zealand]] from his previous posting in [[South Africa]], and used them to pull his carriage on his privately owned [[Kawau Island]].\n\n[[File:Zebra-tame-jumping.jpg|thumb|Jumping an obstacle: riding a zebra in East Africa, about 1900]]\nCaptain Horace Hayes, in \"Points of the Horse\" (circa 1893), compared the usefulness of different zebra species. In 1891, Hayes broke a mature, intact mountain zebra stallion to ride in two days' time, and the animal was quiet enough for his wife to ride and be photographed upon. He found the [[Burchell's zebra]] easy to break, and considered it ideal for domestication, as it was immune to the bite of the [[tsetse fly]]. He considered the [[quagga]] (now extinct) well-suited to domestication due to being easy to train to saddle and harness.<ref>Hayes, Capt. Horace (1893), ''[https://archive.org/details/pointsofhorsefam00hayerich Points of the Horse]'', pp. 311\u2013316, London: W. Thacker</ref>\n\n===Conservation===\nHumans have greatly impacted the zebra population. Zebras were, and still are, hunted for their skins and meat. They also compete with livestock for forage<ref name=Competition>{{Cite journal|author=Young, T.P.|title=Competition and compensation among cattle, zebras, and elephants in a semi-arid savanna in Laikipia, Kenya|journal=Biological Conservation |year=2005 |volume=121 |pages=351\u2013359|doi=10.1016/j.biocon.2004.08.007|issue=2|url=http://gepv.univ-lille1.fr/downloads/enseignements/M1-S7/B16-Analyse%20d%27articles/Young%20et%20al.,%202005,%20Biol%20Conservation.pdf|display-authors=etal}}</ref> and are sometimes culled.\n\nThe Cape mountain zebra was hunted to near extinction, with less than 100 individuals by the 1930s. The population has since increased to about 700 due to conservation efforts. Both mountain zebra subspecies are currently protected in national parks, but are still endangered.\n\nThe Gr\u00e9vy's zebra is also endangered. Hunting and competition from livestock have greatly decreased their population. Because of the population's small size, environmental hazards, such as drought, are capable of affecting the entire species. Plains zebras are much more numerous and have a healthy population. Nevertheless, they too have been reduced by hunting and loss of habitat to farming.\n\n===Cultural depictions===\nZebras have been the subject of [[Africa]]n [[Folklore|folk tales]] which tell how they got their stripes. According to a [[San people|San]] folk tale of [[Namibia]], the zebra was once all white, but acquired its black stripes after a fight with a [[baboon]] over a waterhole. After kicking the baboon so hard, the zebra lost his balance and tripped over a fire, and the fire sticks left scorch marks all over his white coat.<ref>{{cite web|url= http://www.gateway-africa.com/stories/How_the_Zebra_Got_his_Stripes_San.html|title= How the Zebra got its stripes.
