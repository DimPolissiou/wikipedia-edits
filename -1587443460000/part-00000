These modes include Multiples, Factors, Primes, Equalities, and Inequalities.\n\nMultiples - The objective is to find multiples of the number given.  If presented a 3, you would select numbers like 3, 6, 9, 12, etc.\n\nFactors - In this mode you find factors divisible by the number given.  If the number is 12, you would choose to eat 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, and 12.\n\nPrimes - This mode helps you find prime numbers that are only divisible by 1 and themselves. e.g., 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13.\n\nEquality - This mode gives you the chance to find equations equaling the current number.  If given the number 6, you would 'munch' 3 x 2, 3 + 3, 12 / 2, and so on.\n\nInequality - This mode gives you the number and you must select the equations that DO NOT equal the current number.  If given 6, you would eat equations such as 4 X 2, 18 / 9, and 3 + 5.\n\n===Troggles===\nThe Troggles are [[monster]]s with two legs and a large head, whose goal is to eat Muncher and/or disrupt his progress by rearranging things on the board.  Levels 1, 2, and 3, contain only one Troggle on the grid at any given time. A second Troggle appears starting with level 4, and a third appears starting with level 8. After approximately level 18, the game (especially the movement of the Troggles) accelerates to make responsible munching more difficult.\n\nThere are several type of \"Troggles.\"  Each type of Troggle moves in a specific pattern.  There are five [[species]] of Troggle, each of which has an English and a mock-Latin ([[binomial nomenclature|binomial]]) name:\n*'''Reggies''' (''Trogglus normalus'') (magenta on Apple II, red in DOS, purple on Macintosh) - simply moves in a line unless redirected by a safety square in its path.\n*'''Bashfuls''' (''Trogglus timidus'') (green on Apple II, blue in DOS, pink on Macintosh) - moves in an arbitrary manner on the gameboard, unless approached by a Muncher, in which case he moves away from the Muncher.  Became purple in later releases in the series.\n*'''Helpers''' (''Trogglus assistus'') (green on Apple II and DOS, magenta on Macintosh) - this [[ant]]-like Troggle eats all answers, leaving nothing behind.  Became purple in later releases in the series.\n*'''Workers''' (''Trogglus laborus'') (purple and white on Apple II and DOS, magenta and white on Macintosh) - this Troggle adds new answers and/or changes existing answers as he moves around.\n*'''Smarties''' (''Trogglus smarticus'') (green on Apple II and Macintosh, yellow on DOS) - has large teeth and glasses, and the most difficult enemy to avoid; always follows the Muncher on the board.\n\nSafety squares occasionally appear to help protect Muncher from the Troggles. These are temporary havens identified by four small white rectangles on the corner of the square. No Troggle may enter a safety square; if one appears on a square a Troggle currently occupies, that Troggle dies (but may be replaced afterwards). Safety squares may disappear as quickly and randomly as they appear; hence, one must take caution not to remain in one for long.\n\nIn addition, Troggles are quite [[cannibalism|cannibalistic]]; if one Troggle enters a square already occupied by another, or if two of them enter one square at the same time (even if they are of the same species), one Troggle will eat the other (however, another Troggle may re-enter the board afterwards).\n\n===Levels===\nPlayers can choose from the 5 modes of play, or choose a \"challenge\" mode,  which randomizes these modes.  In the Multiples mode, Muncher must munch all numbers which are multiples of the number given; for example, if the designated number is 3 then Muncher must eat all 6's, 9's, and 12's and avoid numbers such as 7. In Factors the muncher seeks to ingest the factors of a given number, in Primes he craves prime numbers, and in the Equality and Inequality modes the muncher devours expressions such as 2+4 which are equivalent or not equivalent (respectively) to the designated number.\n\nGame play begins with four Muncher lives (the one currently in play, plus three others in reserve).  After scoring a certain number of points, the player gains an extra life.  Players lose a life if they munch an incorrect answer. Additionally, five different types of enemy (or \"Troggle\") appear throughout the game. Players lose a life if they make contact with a Troggle.\n\n===Cutscenes===\nAs in the other games in the series, a player is awarded with a cutscene (reminiscent of [[Wile E. Coyote and Road Runner]] escapades) after every third level; in this game, these are dubbed as \"Great Moments in Muncher History\".  While these scenes are numbered (Act 1, Act 2, etc.), the order they appear in varies from game to game.  Once all six have been shown, they begin to repeat themselves (starting with the scene after Level 21).  The six scenes are as follows:\n* A Muncher is chased by a Reggie across the screen twice, then the Muncher gets in an old-timey automobile, outruns the Troggle, and the Troggle falls down and gives up.\n* Two Munchers reenact the story of [[William Tell]].\n* A Muncher races a Bashful up a mountain, plants his flag, and sings a song (Ding Dong! the Witch is Dead).\n* A Muncher [[Prank call|prank-calls]] a Smartie and sings the [[Nyah nyah nyah nyah nyah nyah|nyah-nyah]] taunting melody.\n* A Muncher beats two Troggles in a beauty contest. ''Later releases of the game replaced this cut scene with one in which a Muncher stumbles through his house in the dark and then turns on the light, only to discover that he has broken all of his furniture.''\n* A Muncher carves his own image into [[Mount Rushmore]].\n\n===Easter egg===\nAs an [[Easter egg (media)|Easter egg]], between  December 1 and [[Christmas Day|25th]], the Muncher would wear a [[Santa Claus]] [[hat]]. This only worked on a computer that had a built-in clock or that was never turned off, as the built-in clock was not common at the time the games were popular.\n\n==Word Munchers==\nWord Munchers is a [[spin-off (media)|spin-off]] of ''Number Munchers'' designed to teach basic grammar skills, it was popular among [[United States|American]] schoolchildren in the 1980s and 1990s and was used as a teaching aid widely used in schools.\n\nThough the gameplay was the same as in Number Munchers, specific to ''Word Munchers'' were the modes of play, which includes [[part of speech|parts of speech]] such as [[verb]]s or [[adjective]]s. Teachers had the options to select the vowel sounds and how difficult the word sets would be, such as whether or not to include words that break pronunciation rules.\n\n==Gameplay==\n[[File:Number-Munchers-screenshot.png|thumb|right|alt=A screenshot from the Number Munchers game (DOS version) showing the muncher and a troggle monster in the playfield.|''Number Munchers'' gameplay (DOS version)]]In all the ''Munchers'' games, the player controls a green \"Muncher\" character across a grid of squares containing a short numerical or word expression. The objective is to consume all and only the grids containing information satisfying a specific criterion (determined by the mode of play) while also avoiding the deadly \"Troggle\" monsters which roamed the grid.\n\nEating a grid containing information that did not match the criterion of the play mode chosen or being caught by a Troggle resulted in the loss of a life.\n\nIf all grids containing information matching the criterion were eaten from the screen, the level ended and the player was presented with an amusing short scene, similar to [[Wile E. Coyote and the Road Runner]] scenes, in which the Muncher foils the Troggles' plans to catch it and often destroys the Troggle in some comical manner. The game gets continually faster and harder each level.\n\n==Versions==\nThe Munchers series included:\n* ''Number Munchers''\n* ''Fraction Munchers''\n* ''Word Munchers''\n* ''Super Munchers''\n* ''Math Munchers Deluxe'' (a remake of ''Number Munchers'')\n* ''Word Munchers Deluxe'' (also a remake of ''Word Munchers'')\n* ''Math Munchers for the 21st Century''\n* ''Word Munchers for the 21st Century''\n* ''Knowledge Munchers Deluxe'' (Originally released as \"Trivia Munchers Deluxe\")\n* ''Troggle Trouble Math'' (a spin-off)\n\nThe original version only allowed navigation through the [[computer keyboard|keyboard]] [[arrow keys]].

They were popular among [[United States|American]] schoolchildren in the 1980s and 1990s and were the recipients of several awards. The two original games in the series were ''Number Munchers'' and ''Word Munchers''.\n\nAs of 2017, [[Houghton Mifflin Harcourt]] is offering the Munchers brand as a licensing opportunity on its website.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.hmhco.com/at-home/featured-shops/the-learning-company/licensing-opportunities|title=Licensing Opportunities|website=Houghton Mifflin Harcourt|access-date=2017-01-17}}</ref>\n\n==Number Munchers==\n''Number Munchers'' is the first [[educational game]] in the Munchers series.

These modes include Multiples, Factors, Primes, Equalities, and Inequalities.\n\nMultiples - The objective is to find multiples of the number given.  If presented a 3, you would select numbers like 3, 6, 9, 12, etc.\n\nFactors - In this mode you find factors divisible by the number given.  If the number is 12, you would choose to eat 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, and 12.\n\nPrimes - This mode helps you find prime numbers that are only divisible by 1 and themselves. e.g., 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13.\n\nEquality - This mode gives you the chance to find equations equaling the current number.  If given the number 6, you would 'munch' 3 x 2, 3 + 3, 12 / 2, and so on.\n\nInequality - This mode gives you the number and you must select the equations that DO NOT equal the current number.  If given 6, you would eat equations such as 4 X 2, 18 / 9, and 3 + 5.\n\n===Troggles===\nThe Troggles are [[monster]]s with two legs and a large head, whose goal is to eat Muncher and/or disrupt his progress by rearranging things on the board.  Levels 1, 2, and 3, contain only one Troggle on the grid at any given time. A second Troggle appears starting with level 4, and a third appears starting with level 8. After approximately level 18, the game (especially the movement of the Troggles) accelerates to make responsible munching more difficult.\n\nThere are several type of \"Troggles.\"  Each type of Troggle moves in a specific pattern.  There are five [[species]] of Troggle, each of which has an English and a mock-Latin ([[binomial nomenclature|binomial]]) name:\n*'''Reggies''' (''Trogglus normalus'') (magenta on Apple II, red in DOS, purple on Macintosh) - simply moves in a line unless redirected by a safety square in its path.\n*'''Bashfuls''' (''Trogglus timidus'') (green on Apple II, blue in DOS, pink on Macintosh) - moves in an arbitrary manner on the gameboard, unless approached by a Muncher, in which case he moves away from the Muncher.  Became purple in later releases in the series.\n*'''Helpers''' (''Trogglus assistus'') (green on Apple II and DOS, magenta on Macintosh) - this [[ant]]-like Troggle eats all answers, leaving nothing behind.  Became purple in later releases in the series.\n*'''Workers''' (''Trogglus laborus'') (purple and white on Apple II and DOS, magenta and white on Macintosh) - this Troggle adds new answers and/or changes existing answers as he moves around.\n*'''Smarties''' (''Trogglus smarticus'') (green on Apple II and Macintosh, yellow on DOS) - has large teeth and glasses, and the most difficult enemy to avoid; always follows the Muncher on the board.\n\nSafety squares occasionally appear to help protect Muncher from the Troggles. These are temporary havens identified by four small white rectangles on the corner of the square. No Troggle may enter a safety square; if one appears on a square a Troggle currently occupies, that Troggle dies (but may be replaced afterwards). Safety squares may disappear as quickly and randomly as they appear; hence, one must take caution not to remain in one for long.\n\nIn addition, Troggles are quite [[cannibalism|cannibalistic]]; if one Troggle enters a square already occupied by another, or if two of them enter one square at the same time (even if they are of the same species), one Troggle will eat the other (however, another Troggle may re-enter the board afterwards).\n\n===Levels===\nPlayers can choose from the 5 modes of play, or choose a \"challenge\" mode,  which randomizes these modes.  In the Multiples mode, Muncher must munch all numbers which are multiples of the number given; for example, if the designated number is 3 then Muncher must eat all 6's, 9's, and 12's and avoid numbers such as 7. In Factors the muncher seeks to ingest the factors of a given number, in Primes he craves prime numbers, and in the Equality and Inequality modes the muncher devours expressions such as 2+4 which are equivalent or not equivalent (respectively) to the designated number.\n\nGame play begins with four Muncher lives (the one currently in play, plus three others in reserve).  After scoring a certain number of points, the player gains an extra life.  Players lose a life if they swallow an incorrect answer. Additionally, five different types of enemy (or \"Troggle\") appear throughout the game. Players lose a life if they make contact with a Troggle.\n\n===Cutscenes===\nAs in the other games in the series, a player is awarded with a cutscene (reminiscent of [[Wile E. Coyote and Road Runner]] escapades) after every third level; in this game, these are dubbed as \"Great Moments in Muncher History\".  While these scenes are numbered (Act 1, Act 2, etc.), the order they appear in varies from game to game.  Once all six have been shown, they begin to repeat themselves (starting with the scene after Level 21).  The six scenes are as follows:\n* A Muncher is chased by a Reggie across the screen twice, then the Muncher gets in an old-timey automobile, outruns the Troggle, and the Troggle falls down and gives up.\n* Two Munchers reenact the story of [[William Tell]].\n* A Muncher races a Bashful up a mountain, plants his flag, and sings a song (Ding Dong! the Witch is Dead).\n* A Muncher [[Prank call|prank-calls]] a Smartie and sings the [[Nyah nyah nyah nyah nyah nyah|nyah-nyah]] taunting melody.\n* A Muncher beats two Troggles in a beauty contest. ''Later releases of the game replaced this cut scene with one in which a Muncher stumbles through his house in the dark and then turns on the light, only to discover that he has broken all of his furniture.''\n* A Muncher carves his own image into [[Mount Rushmore]].\n\n===Easter egg===\nAs an [[Easter egg (media)|Easter egg]], between  December 1 and [[Christmas Day|25th]], the Muncher would wear a [[Santa Claus]] [[hat]].

Some atypical antipsychotics have received regulatory approval (e.g. by the [[Food and Drug Administration|FDA]] of the [[United States of America|US]], the [[Therapeutic Goods Administration|TGA]] of [[Australia]], the [[Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency|MHRA]] of the [[United Kingdom|UK]]) for [[schizophrenia]], [[bipolar disorder]], [[autism]], and as an [[adjuvant therapy|adjunct]] in [[major depressive disorder]].\n\nBoth generations of medication tend to block receptors in the brain's [[dopamine pathways]].  Atypicals are less likely than [[haloperidol]] &mdash; the most widely used [[typical antipsychotic]] &mdash; to cause [[extrapyramidal symptom|extrapyramidal]] [[motor control]] [[disabilities]] in patients such as unsteady [[Parkinson's disease]]-type movements, body [[Rigidity (neurology)|rigidity]], and involuntary [[tremor]]s.

It is not clear, then, if atypical antipsychotics, having been in use for a relatively short time, produce a lower incidence of tardive dyskinesia.<ref name = Maudsley /><ref name = UpToDateSchiz>{{cite web | vauthors = Stroup TS, Marder S, Stein MB |title=Pharmacotherapy for schizophrenia: Acute and maintenance phase treatment|url=http://www.uptodate.com/contents/pharmacotherapy-for-schizophrenia-acute-and-maintenance-phase-treatment|work=UpToDate\u00ae|publisher=Wolters Kluwer|accessdate=10 October 2013|date=23 October 2013}}</ref>\n\nSome of the other side effects that have been suggested is that atypical antipsychotics increase the risk of cardiovascular disease.<ref name=\"pmid15156241\">{{cite journal | vauthors = Kabinoff GS, Toalson PA, Healey KM, McGuire HC, Hay DP | title = Metabolic Issues With Atypical Antipsychotics in Primary Care: Dispelling the Myths | journal = Primary Care Companion to the Journal of Clinical Psychiatry | volume = 5 | issue = 1 | pages = 6\u201314 | date = February 2003 | pmid = 15156241 | pmc = 353028 | doi = 10.4088/PCC.v05n0103 }}</ref> The research that Kabinoff et al. found that the increase in cardiovascular disease is seen regardless of the treatment they receive, instead it is caused by many different factors such as lifestyle or diet.<ref name=\"pmid15156241\"/>\n\nSexual side effects have also been reported when taking atypical antipsychotics.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = U\u00e7ok A, Gaebel W | title = Side effects of atypical antipsychotics: a brief overview | journal = World Psychiatry | volume = 7 | issue = 1 | pages = 58\u201362 | date = February 2008 | pmid = 18458771 | pmc = 2327229 | doi = 10.1002/j.2051-5545.2008.tb00154.x }}</ref> In males antipsychotics reduce sexual interest, impair sexual performance with the main difficulties being failure to ejaculate.<ref name=\"McKim, W. 2007 pp.241-260\"/> In females there may be abnormal menstrual cycles and infertility.<ref>{{cite book |last=McKim |first=W. | name-list-format = vanc |year=2007 |title=Psychomotor Stimulants in Drugs and Behavior: An Introduction to Behavioral Pharmacology |pages=241\u201360 |location=Upper Saddle River, NJ. |publisher=Pearson Prentice Hall}}</ref> In both males and females the breasts may become enlarged and a fluid will sometimes ooze from the nipples.<ref name=\"McKim, W. 2007 pp.241-260\"/> Sexual adverse effects caused by some anti-psychotics are a result of an increase of prolactin.

After taking an antipsychotic, antagonism of D<sub>2</sub> receptors occurs throughout the entire brain, leading to a number of deleterious side effects from D<sub>2</sub> receptor antagonism throughout the entire dopamine pathway system. Unfortunately, it\u2019s not possible to affect D<sub>2</sub> receptors only in the mesolimbic pathway.<ref name=\"Stahl AP Explained 1\"/>{{refn|group=Stahl AP Explained 1 -|name=S1|p. 329-336.<ref name=\"Stahl AP Explained 1\"/>}} Fortunately, 5-HT<sub>2A</sub> receptor antagonism reverses these side effects to some extent.{{refn|group=Stahl AP Explained 1 -|name=S2|p. 346-352.<ref name=\"Stahl AP Explained 1\"/>}} Reducing D<sub>2</sub> dopaminergic activity in the mesolimbic pathway also results in an anhedonic effect, reducing pleasure, motivation, and the salience of one\u2019s life experience. In the mesocortical pathway to the [[DLPFC]] and [[VMPFC]], endogenous D<sub>2</sub> receptor dopamine activity is sometimes low in schizophrenia, resulting in cognitive, affective, and, broadly, the negative symptoms of schizophrenia. D<sub>2</sub> receptor antagonism here further compounds these problems. In the nigrostratial pathway, D<sub>2</sub> receptor antagonism results in [[extrapyramidal symptoms]]. If this antagonism occurs long enough, symptoms of EPS may become permanent, even if antipsychotic use is discontinued. In the tuberoinfundibular pathway, D<sub>2</sub> receptor antagonism results in elevated prolactin.

The result of this is that dopamine competes with antipsychotic D<sub>2</sub> antagonistic action at D<sub>2</sub> receptors, thereby reducing antagonistic binding there and eliminating or lowering D<sub>2</sub> antagonistic effects in several pathways of the dopamine system.{{refn|group=Stahl AP Explained 1 -|name=S2|}} In the nigrostratial pathway, it reduces EPS.

Clozapine (Clozaril), an atypical antipsychotic, fell out of favor due to concerns over drug-induced [[agranulocytosis]]. Following research indicating its effectiveness in treatment-resistant [[schizophrenia]] and the development of an adverse event monitoring system, clozapine re-emerged as a viable antipsychotic. According to Barker (2003), the three most-accepted atypical drugs are clozapine, risperidone, and olanzapine. However, he goes on to explain that clozapine is usually the last resort when other drugs fail. Clozapine can cause agranulocytosis (a decreased number of white blood cells), requiring blood monitoring for the patient. Despite the effectiveness of clozapine for treatment-resistant schizophrenia, agents with a more favorable side-effect profile were sought-after for widespread use. During the 1990s, [[olanzapine]], [[risperidone]], and [[quetiapine]] were introduced, with [[ziprasidone]] and [[aripiprazole]] following in the early 2000s. The atypical anti-psychotic [[paliperidone]] was approved by the FDA in late 2006.{{citation needed|date=August 2013}}\n\nThe atypical antipsychotics have found favor among clinicians and are now considered to be [[first-line treatment]]s for schizophrenia and are gradually replacing the [[typical antipsychotic]]s. In the past, most researchers have agreed that the defining characteristics of atypical antipsychotics are the decreased incidence of [[extrapyramidal symptoms|extrapyramidal]] side effects (EPS)<ref name=\"pmid16498489\">{{cite journal | vauthors = Farah A | title = Atypicality of atypical antipsychotics | journal = Primary Care Companion to the Journal of Clinical Psychiatry | volume = 7 | issue = 6 | pages = 268\u201374 | year = 2005 | pmid = 16498489 | pmc = 1324958 | doi = 10.4088/PCC.v07n0602 }}</ref> and an absence of sustained [[prolactin]] elevation.<ref name=pmid11873706 />\n\nThe terminology can still be imprecise. The definition of \"atypicality\" was based upon the absence of extrapyramidal side effects, but there is now a clear understanding that atypical antipsychotics can still induce these effects (though to a lesser degree than typical antipsychotics).<ref name=\"pmid17242588\">{{cite journal | vauthors = Weiden PJ | title = EPS profiles: the atypical antipsychotics are not all the same | journal = Journal of Psychiatric Practice | volume = 13 | issue = 1 | pages = 13\u201324 | date = January 2007 | pmid = 17242588 | doi = 10.1097/00131746-200701000-00003 }}</ref> Recent literature focuses more upon specific pharmacological actions and less upon categorization of an agent as \"typical\" or \"atypical\".

It is not clear, then, if atypical antipsychotics, having been in use for a relatively short time, produce a lower incidence of tardive dyskinesia.<ref name = Maudsley /><ref name = UpToDateSchiz>{{cite web | vauthors = Stroup TS, Marder S, Stein MB |title=Pharmacotherapy for schizophrenia: Acute and maintenance phase treatment|url=http://www.uptodate.com/contents/pharmacotherapy-for-schizophrenia-acute-and-maintenance-phase-treatment|work=UpToDate\u00ae|publisher=Wolters Kluwer|accessdate=10 October 2013|date=23 October 2013}}</ref>\n\nSome of the other side effects that have been suggested is that atypical antipsychotics increase the risk of cardiovascular disease.<ref name=\"pmid15156241\">{{cite journal | vauthors = Kabinoff GS, Toalson PA, Healey KM, McGuire HC, Hay DP | title = Metabolic Issues With Atypical Antipsychotics in Primary Care: Dispelling the Myths | journal = Primary Care Companion to the Journal of Clinical Psychiatry | volume = 5 | issue = 1 | pages = 6\u201314 | date = February 2003 | pmid = 15156241 | pmc = 353028 | doi = 10.4088/PCC.v05n0103 }}</ref> The research that Kabinoff et al. found that the increase in cardiovascular disease is seen regardless of the treatment they receive, instead it is caused by many different factors such as lifestyle or diet.<ref name=\"pmid15156241\"/>\n\nSexual side effects have also been reported when taking atypical antipsychotics.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = U\u00e7ok A, Gaebel W | title = Side effects of atypical antipsychotics: a brief overview | journal = World Psychiatry | volume = 7 | issue = 1 | pages = 58\u201362 | date = February 2008 | pmid = 18458771 | pmc = 2327229 | doi = 10.1002/j.2051-5545.2008.tb00154.x }}</ref> In males antipsychotics reduce sexual interest, impair sexual performance with the main difficulties being failure to ejaculate.<ref name=\"McKim, W. 2007 pp.241-260\"/> In females there may be abnormal menstrual cycles and infertility.<ref>{{cite book |last=McKim |first=W. | name-list-format = vanc |year=2007 |title=Psychomotor Stimulants in Drugs and Behavior: An Introduction to Behavioral Pharmacology |pages=241\u201360 |location=Upper Saddle River, NJ. |publisher=Pearson Prentice Hall}}</ref> In both males and females the breasts may become enlarged and a fluid will sometimes ooze from the nipples.<ref name=\"McKim, W. 2007 pp.241-260\"/> Sexual adverse effects caused by some anti-psychotics are a result of an increase of prolactin.

After taking an antipsychotic, antagonism of D<sub>2</sub> receptors occurs throughout the entire brain, leading to a number of deleterious side effects from D<sub>2</sub> receptor antagonism throughout the entire dopamine pathway system. Unfortunately, it\u2019s not possible to affect D<sub>2</sub> receptors only in the mesolimbic pathway.<ref name=\"Stahl AP Explained 1\"/>{{refn|group=Stahl AP Explained 1 -|name=S1|p. 329-336.<ref name=\"Stahl AP Explained 1\"/>}} Fortunately, 5-HT<sub>2A</sub> receptor antagonism reverses these side effects to some extent.{{refn|group=Stahl AP Explained 1 -|name=S2|p. 346-352.<ref name=\"Stahl AP Explained 1\"/>}} Reducing D<sub>2</sub> dopaminergic activity in the mesolimbic pathway also results in an anhedonic effect, reducing pleasure, motivation, and the salience of one\u2019s life experience. In the mesocortical pathway to the [[DLPFC]] and [[VMPFC]], endogenous D<sub>2</sub> receptor dopamine activity is sometimes low in schizophrenia, resulting in cognitive, affective, and, broadly, the negative symptoms of schizophrenia. D<sub>2</sub> receptor antagonism here further compounds these problems. In the nigrostratial pathway, D<sub>2</sub> receptor antagonism results in [[extrapyramidal symptoms]]. If this antagonism occurs long enough, symptoms of EPS may become permanent, even if antipsychotic use is discontinued. In the tuberoinfundibular pathway, D<sub>2</sub> receptor antagonism results in elevated prolactin.

The result of this is that dopamine competes with antipsychotic D<sub>2</sub> antagonistic action at D<sub>2</sub> receptors, thereby reducing antagonistic binding there and eliminating or lowering D<sub>2</sub> antagonistic effects in several pathways of the dopamine system.{{refn|group=Stahl AP Explained 1 -|name=S2|}} In the nigrostratial pathway, it reduces EPS.

Clozapine (Clozaril), an atypical antipsychotic, fell out of favor due to concerns over drug-induced [[agranulocytosis]]. Following research indicating its effectiveness in treatment-resistant [[schizophrenia]] and the development of an adverse event monitoring system, clozapine re-emerged as a viable antipsychotic. According to Barker (2003), the three most-accepted atypical drugs are clozapine, risperidone, and olanzapine. However, he goes on to explain that clozapine is usually the last resort when other drugs fail. Clozapine can cause agranulocytosis (a decreased number of white blood cells), requiring blood monitoring for the patient. Despite the effectiveness of clozapine for treatment-resistant schizophrenia, agents with a more favorable side-effect profile were sought-after for widespread use. During the 1990s, [[olanzapine]], [[risperidone]], and [[quetiapine]] were introduced, with [[ziprasidone]] and [[aripiprazole]] following in the early 2000s. The atypical anti-psychotic [[paliperidone]] was approved by the FDA in late 2006.{{citation needed|date=August 2013}}\n\nThe atypical antipsychotics have found favor among clinicians and are now considered to be [[first-line treatment]]s for schizophrenia and are gradually replacing the [[typical antipsychotic]]s. In the past, most researchers have agreed that the defining characteristics of atypical antipsychotics are the decreased incidence of [[extrapyramidal symptoms|extrapyramidal]] side effects (EPS)<ref name=\"pmid16498489\">{{cite journal | vauthors = Farah A | title = Atypicality of atypical antipsychotics | journal = Primary Care Companion to the Journal of Clinical Psychiatry | volume = 7 | issue = 6 | pages = 268\u201374 | year = 2005 | pmid = 16498489 | pmc = 1324958 | doi = 10.4088/PCC.v07n0602 }}</ref> and an absence of sustained [[prolactin]] elevation.<ref name=pmid11873706 />\n\nThe terminology can still be imprecise. The definition of \"atypicality\" was based upon the absence of extrapyramidal side effects, but there is now a clear understanding that atypical antipsychotics can still induce these effects (though to a lesser degree than typical antipsychotics).<ref name=\"pmid17242588\">{{cite journal | vauthors = Weiden PJ | title = EPS profiles: the atypical antipsychotics are not all the same | journal = Journal of Psychiatric Practice | volume = 13 | issue = 1 | pages = 13\u201324 | date = January 2007 | pmid = 17242588 | doi = 10.1097/00131746-200701000-00003 }}</ref> Recent literature focuses more upon specific pharmacological actions and less upon categorization of an agent as \"typical\" or \"atypical\".

Using a number of parameters to assess quality of life, [[University of Manchester|Manchester University]] researchers found that typical antipsychotics were no worse than atypical antipsychotics.

Seven-eighths European in ancestry, he was legally white under Virginia law and freed in 1826 by the will of his master (and father) [[Thomas Jefferson]]. Julia Ann Isaacs, a [[free people of color|free woman of color]], was of African, European-American and German-Jewish descent. They moved their family from Ohio to Wisconsin in 1852 for added security after passage of the [[Fugitive Slave Act of 1850]].

By the late 19th century, he operated a small manufacturing company that made screws and developed technology which made his company valuable enough to sell to Standard Screw (based in Connecticut) in 1900. When appointed as president in 1904, Pearson soon doubled the company's subsidiaries from four to eight, increasing their skilled workforce and facilities. He led Standard Screw Company to dominance in the industry through the early twentieth century. Together with two other leaders, Pearson introduced the \" 'new Standard Automatic,' a machine that reduced the cost of making screws nearly 40 percent.\"<ref name=\"Stana\"/> In 1904 he reduced prices, which gave the company an edge with the new auto manufacturers, whose rapid expansion as an industry fed Standard's profits.<ref name=\"Stana\"/>\n\nThe coming of [[World War I]] led to a major increase in profits, as Pearson won contracts from the British and US governments for bullets and fuses. The 1916 profit was 10 times higher than the previous year, and returns increased by 340 percent in 1917. Pearson had established a dominance among companies that manufactured screw machine products; his skilled shops could make complex parts for many different industries, and held the edge for decades. Pearson was described as the company's \"first outstanding leader.\"<ref name=\"Stana\">[http://www.answers.com/topic/stanadyne-automotive-corporation \"Stanadyne Automotive Corporation\"], ''Gale Directory of Company Histories,'' 2006, Answers.com, accessed 14 June 2012</ref>\n\n==Marriage and family==\nWalter Pearson married Helena Snyder (her name was later anglicized to Helen; born in Illinois, she was the daughter of German immigrants.)

Their knowledge of the family connection to Thomas Jefferson had been lost in the 1940s, as the Jefferson brothers decided not to pass on the story, for fear their children would face racial discrimination because of descent from the slave Sally Hemings.

Both a governing body and an advocacy group, Student Government is involved in policy-making, adjudication, programming, advocating, community service, and countless other activities. The organization is a clearinghouse for concerns from students and answers from administrators. The organization also is responsible for distributing a portion of the fees it receives to student organizations in a process known as appropriations.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://students.ncsu.edu/home/overview.php |title=Description of the NC State Student Government. |access-date=September 27, 2006 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060926234901/http://students.ncsu.edu/home/overview.php |archive-date=September 26, 2006 |url-status=live }}</ref>\n\nThe student government at NC State is composed of three branches, and headed by four student body officers (SBOs). The student body president heads the executive branch. The president executes policy passed by the senate and is a member of the NC State board of trustees. The president runs for office and serves with a student body vice president, who assumes the presidency if that office becomes vacant. The student senate is a 64-member body that considers legislative policy on behalf of the students of the university. It is headed by the student senate president, who serves as the executive student body vice president. The Senate is also responsible for approving the annual Student Government budget. The budget is drafted each year by the Student Body Treasurer who oversees the monetary status of the entirety of Student Government and as such is a member of both the Legislative and Executive branches. The student chief justice heads the [[judicial branch]] and is the only member of that branch elected by the student body.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://students.ncsu.edu/judicial/index.php |title=NC State's Judicial Branch. |access-date=September 27, 2006 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060926235109/http://students.ncsu.edu/judicial/index.php |archive-date=September 26, 2006 |url-status=live }}</ref>\n\n===Student traditions===\n====Service NC State====\nService NC State (SNCS) is sponsored by the Center for Student Leadership, Ethics & Public Service as the definitive service event to welcome new students to NC State's campus, and as a way to impact the community.

Both a governing body and an advocacy group, Student Government is involved in policy-making, adjudication, programming, advocating, community service, and countless other activities. The organization is a clearinghouse for concerns from students and answers from administrators. The organization also is responsible for distributing a portion of the fees it receives to student organizations in a process known as appropriations.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://students.ncsu.edu/home/overview.php |title=Description of the NC State Student Government. |access-date=September 27, 2006 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060926234901/http://students.ncsu.edu/home/overview.php |archive-date=September 26, 2006 |url-status=live }}</ref>\n\nThe Student Government at NC State is composed of three branches, and headed by four Student Body Officers (SBOs). The Student Body President heads the executive branch. The President executes policy passed by the senate and is a member of the NC State Board of Trustees. The President runs for office and serves with a Student Body Vice President, who assumes the presidency if that office becomes vacant. The Student Senate is a 64-member body that considers legislative policy on behalf of the students of the university. It is headed by the Student Senate President who serves as the Executive Student Body Vice President. The Senate is also responsible for approving the annual Student Government budget. The budget is drafted each year by the Student Body Treasurer who oversees the monetary status of the entirety of Student Government and as such is a member of both the Legislative and Executive branches. The Student Chief Justice heads the [[judicial branch]] and is the only member of that branch elected by the student body.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://students.ncsu.edu/judicial/index.php |title=NC State's Judicial Branch. |access-date=September 27, 2006 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060926235109/http://students.ncsu.edu/judicial/index.php |archive-date=September 26, 2006 |url-status=live }}</ref>\n\n===Student traditions===\n====Service NC State====\nService NC State (SNCS) is sponsored by the Center for Student Leadership, Ethics & Public Service as the definitive service event to welcome new students to NC State's campus, and as a way to impact the community.
