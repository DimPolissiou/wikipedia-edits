The ten principles are:\n\n# authors should retain [[copyright]] on their publications, which must be published under an open license such as [[Creative Commons]];\n# the members of the coalition should establish robust criteria and requirements for compliant open access journals and platforms;\n# they should also provide incentives for the creation of compliant open access journals and platforms if they do not yet exist;\n# publication fees should be covered by the funders or universities, not individual researchers;\n# such publication fees should be standardized and capped;\n# universities, research organizations, and libraries should align their policies and strategies;\n# for books and monographs, the timeline may be extended beyond 2021;\n# open archives and repositories are acknowledged for their importance;\n# [[hybrid open-access journal]]s are not compliant with the key principle;\n# members of the coalition should monitor and sanction non-compliance.\n\n== Specific implementation guidance ==\nA task force of Science Europe, lead by [[John-Arne R\u00f8ttingen]] ([[Research Council of Norway|RCN]]) and David Sweeney ([[UKRI]]), has developed a specific implementation guidance on the Plan S principles, released on November 27, 2018.<ref name=\"guidance\">{{cite news |last1= |first1= |title=Guidance on the Implementation of Plan S |url=https://www.coalition-s.org/wp-content/uploads/271118_cOAlitionS_Guidance.pdf |accessdate=27 November 2018 |work=cOAlition S |date=27 November 2018 }}</ref> The development of the implementation guidance also drew on input from interested parties such as research institutions, researchers, universities, funders, charities, publishers, and civil society.<ref>{{cite news |last1= |first1= |title=cOAlition S Adopts Implementation Guidance on Plan S |url=https://www.coalition-s.org/coalition-s-adopts-implementation-guidance/ |accessdate=22 November 2018 |work=cOAlition S |date=22 November 2018 }}</ref>\n\n=== Transition period ===\nDuring a transition period, publishing in a hybrid journal that is covered by a transformative agreement to become a full open-access venue will remain permissible.<ref name=\"nature20181127\">{{cite news |last1=Else |first1=Holly |title=Funders flesh out details of Europe's bold open-access plan |url=https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-07557-w |accessdate=27 November 2018 |work=Nature |date=27 November 2018 }}</ref> The contracts of such transformative agreements need to be made publicly available (including costs), and may not last beyond 2023.<ref name=\"guidance\"/>\n\n=== Green open access ===\nPublishing in any journal will continue to be permissible subject to the condition that a copy of the manuscript accepted by the journal, or the final published article, will be deposited in an approved open-access repository (green open access) with no embargo on access and with a CC-BY licence.<ref name=\"nature20181127\" />\n\n===  Licensing and rights ===\nIn order to re-use scholarly content, proper attribution needs to be given to the authors, and publications need to be granted a worldwide, royalty-free, non-exclusive, irrevocable license to share and adapt the work for any purpose, including commercially.

Pure \"gold\" open access publishers may be put out of business by incentivizing authors to publish with large publishers which have the market power to negotiate their transition plans with funders, while no incentives are provided to authors to publish with smaller fully open access publishers and scholarly societies.\n\nOASPA commented: \n<blockquote>Discussions and solutions continue to be focussed on the largest, mixed-model publishers. While it is this segment of the market on which funders\u2019 attention \u2013 and spend \u2013 is concentrated, the vast majority of publishers within the so-called \u2018Long Tail\u2019 (the majority of OASPA\u2019s members) appear to be absent from the focus of Plan S. Many of these publishers are too small to negotiate the kind of \u2018transformative\u2019 national Big Deals we are seeing for the largest publishers, while exclusively open access publishers without legacy subscription businesses are also unable to participate. Many are not even of sufficient size to make agreements directly with institutions.\n\nFor a healthy, competitive market in the longer term, the needs of fully open access publishers must not be overlooked at this critical stage. Smaller publishers, learned societies and innovative new platforms will be at a significant disadvantage unless they are properly considered and steps are taken to ensure they are able to compete fairly in the market. Conducting discussions with smaller publishers, both fully OA and those with mixed models, and sharing the outcomes and ideas that arise could therefore be enormously helpful.<ref>{{cite web |title=OASPA Feedback on Plan S Implementation Guidance |url=https://oaspa.org/oaspa-feedback-on-plan-s-implementation-guidance/ |website=OASPA |publisher=OASPA}}</ref></blockquote>\n\n==See also==\n*[[Open science]]\n*[[Project DEAL]]\n*[[Couperin (consortium)|Couperin]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|30em}}\n\n==External links==\n{{Scholia|topic}}\n* {{Official website|coalition-s.org/}}\n* {{cite web |url= https://www.coalition-s.org/wp-content/uploads/271118_cOAlitionS_Guidance.pdf |title= Guidance on the Implementation of Plan S |id= 271118 |date= Nov 23, 2018 }}\n* [https://cyber.harvard.edu/hoap/Open_Access_Tracking_Project Open Access Tracking Project (OATP)]\n** {{cite web |url= http://tagteam.harvard.edu/hubs/oatp/tag/oa.plan_s |title= Articles tagged with ''oa.plan_s'' for the Open Access Tracking Project  |work= TagTeam |publisher= Harvard University}}\n*[https://oa2020.org/wp-content/uploads/pdfs/B14-11-Robert-Jan-Smits.pdf Plan S: Making Open Access a Reality by 2020] (pdf).

Pure \"gold\" open access publishers may be put out of business by incentivizing authors to publish with large publishers which have the market power to negotiate their transition plans with funders, while no incentives are provided to authors to publish with smaller fully open access publishers and scholarly societies.\n\nOASPA commented: \n<blockquote>Discussions and solutions continue to be focussed on the largest, mixed-model publishers. While it is this segment of the market on which funders\u2019 attention \u2013 and spend \u2013 is concentrated, the vast majority of publishers within the so-called \u2018Long Tail\u2019 (the majority of OASPA\u2019s members) appear to be absent from the focus of Plan S. Many of these publishers are too small to negotiate the kind of \u2018transformative\u2019 national Big Deals we are seeing for the largest publishers, while exclusively open access publishers without legacy subscription businesses are also unable to participate. Many are not even of sufficient size to make agreements directly with institutions.\n\nFor a healthy, competitive market in the longer term, the needs of fully open access publishers must not be overlooked at this critical stage. Smaller publishers, learned societies and innovative new platforms will be at a significant disadvantage unless they are properly considered and steps are taken to ensure they are able to compete fairly in the market. Conducting discussions with smaller publishers, both fully OA and those with mixed models, and sharing the outcomes and ideas that arise could therefore be enormously helpful.<ref>{{cite web |title=OASPA Feedback on Plan S Implementation Guidance |url=https://oaspa.org/oaspa-feedback-on-plan-s-implementation-guidance/ |website=OASPA |publisher=OASPA}}</ref></blockquote>\n\n==See also==\n*[[Open science]]\n*[[Project DEAL]]\n*[[Couperin (consortium)|Couperin]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|30em}}\n\n==External links==\n{{Scholia|topic}}\n* {{Official website|coalition-s.org/}}\n* {{cite web |url= https://www.coalition-s.org/wp-content/uploads/271118_cOAlitionS_Guidance.pdf |title= Guidance on the Implementation of Plan S |id= 271118 |date= Nov 23, 2018 }}\n* [https://cyber.harvard.edu/hoap/Open_Access_Tracking_Project Open Access Tracking Project (OATP)]\n** {{cite web |url= http://tagteam.harvard.edu/hubs/oatp/tag/oa.plan_s |title= Articles tagged with ''oa.plan_s'' for the Open Access Tracking Project  |work= TagTeam |publisher= Harvard University}}\n*[https://oa2020.org/wp-content/uploads/pdfs/B14-11-Robert-Jan-Smits.pdf Plan S: Making Open Access a Reality by 2020] (pdf).
