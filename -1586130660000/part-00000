Its lease was then bought by [[Newcastle East End F.C.]] in 1892, before they changed their name to Newcastle United. At the turn of the 19th century, the ground's capacity was given as 30,000 before being redeveloped between 1900 and 1905, increasing the capacity to 60,000 and making it the biggest stadium in England for a time. For most of the 20th century, the stadium changed very little, despite various plans for development of the ground. The old West Stand was replaced with the Milburn Stand in 1987, the Sir John Hall Stand replacing the Leazes End in 1993, and the rest of the ground renovated making the ground a 37,000 capacity [[all-seater stadium]]. Between 1998 and 2000, double tiers were added to the Milburn and John Hall stands to bring the venue up to its current capacity of 52,354. There were plans to build a new 90,000 seater stadium in Leazes park, just behind St James' with Newcastle Falcons taking over St James' Park, but due to protests the plans were dropped. St James' Park currently seats 52,354 people, but club owner [[Mike Ashley (businessman)|Mike Ashley]] would consider taking the roof off The Gallowgate end and adding another 6,000 seats making the total capacity to 58,420, but only if the team manage to finish in the top six places of the Premier League.<ref name=formation /><ref name=st_james>{{cite web|title=The Sports Direct Arena Story |work=nufc.co.uk |url=http://www.nufc.co.uk/page/Club/History/SportsDirectArena |accessdate=13 April 2011 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111113184643/http://www.nufc.co.uk/page/Club/History/SportsDirectArena |archivedate=13 November 2011 }}</ref>\n\nIn October 2009, Mike Ashley announced that he planned to lease the name of the ground in a bid to increase revenue, and in November the stadium was temporarily renamed sportsdirect.com @ St James' Park Stadium.<ref name=off_market /><ref name=direct>{{cite news\n| url        = http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/teams/n/newcastle_united/8342406.stm\n| title      = Newcastle reveal new stadium name\n|work=BBC Sport\n| date       = 4 November 2009\n| accessdate =4 November 2009\n| location   = London\n}}</ref> This name was only supposed to be used until the end of the [[2009\u201310 Newcastle United F.C. season|2009\u201310 season]], but lasted until November 2011.<ref name=direct /><ref>{{cite web\n| url         = http://www.mirrorfootball.co.uk/news/Newcastle-owner-Mike-Ashley-has-spent-a-staggering-285-8million-on-the-club-so-far-it-can-be-revealed-today-article718115.html\n| title       = Newcastle 'have cost Ashley \u00a3285.8m so far'\n| first       = Simon\n| last        = Bird\n| date        = 29 March 2011\n| work=Daily Mirror |location=UK\n| accessdate  =13 April 2011\n}}</ref> On 10 November 2011, the club officially changed the name of the stadium to the Sports Direct Arena, although this was an interim name to showcase the sponsorship capabilities of the stadium.

Later that year, Newcastle's first football club, Tyne Association, was formed. The origins of Newcastle United Football Club itself can be traced back to the formation of a football club by the Stanley Cricket Club of [[Byker]] in November 1881. This team was renamed [[Newcastle East End F.C.]] in October 1882, to avoid confusion with the cricket club in [[Stanley, County Durham]]. Rosewood F.C. of Byker merged with Newcastle East End a short time later. In 1886, Newcastle East End moved from Byker to Heaton. In August 1882, [[Newcastle West End F.C.]] formed from West End Cricket Club, and in May 1886, the club moved into [[St James' Park]].<ref name=formation>{{cite web\n |url=http://www.nufc.co.uk/page/Club/History/ClubHistory/0,,10278~2108980,00.html\n |title=The Formation of Newcastle United\n |author=P.

Despite Belgium's surrender, the Congo remained in the conflict on the [[Allies (World War II)|Allied side]], administered by the [[Belgian government in exile]], and provided much-needed raw materials, most notably [[gold]] and [[uranium]], to the United Kingdom and the United States.\n\nCongolese troops of the ''[[Force Publique]]'' fought alongside British forces in the [[East African Campaign (World War II)|East African Campaign]], and a Congolese medical unit served in [[Battle of Madagascar|Madagascar]] and in the [[Burma Campaign]]. Congolese formations also acted as garrisons in [[Kingdom of Egypt|Egypt]], [[Colony and Protectorate of Nigeria|Nigeria]] and [[Mandatory Palestine|Palestine]].\n\nThe increasing demands placed on the Congolese population by the colonial authorities during the war, however, provoked strikes, riots and other forms of resistance, particularly from the indigenous Congolese. These were repressed, often violently, by the Belgian colonial authorities. The Congo's comparative prosperity during the conflict led to a wave of post-war immigration from Belgium, bringing the white population to 100,000 by 1950, as well as a period of industrialisation that continued throughout the 1950s. The role played by Congolese uranium during the hostilities caused the country to be of interest to the [[Soviet Union]] during the [[Cold War]].\n\n==Background==\n{{main|Battle of Belgium|German occupation of Belgium during World War II}}\n[[File:Monument Albert Kinshasa 5.JPG|thumb|Colonial officials, including the Governor-General, [[Pierre Ryckmans (Governor-General)|Pierre Ryckmans]], in [[Kinshasa|L\u00e9opoldville]] in 1938.]]\n\nFollowing World War I, Belgium possessed two colonies in Africa: the [[Belgian Congo]], which it had controlled since its annexation of the [[Congo Free State]] in 1908, and [[Ruanda-Urundi]], a former German colony that had been mandated to Belgium in 1924 by the [[League of Nations]].<ref name=Larousse1>{{cite web|title=Empire Colonial Belge|url=http://www.larousse.fr/encyclopedie/autre-region/Empire_colonial_belge/182725|publisher=[[\u00c9ditions Larousse]]|work=Online Encyclopedia|accessdate=17 July 2013}}</ref> The Belgian colonial military numbered 18,000 soldiers, making it one of the largest standing colonial armies in Africa at the time.<ref name=Killingray7>{{cite book|last=Killingray|first=David|title=Fighting for Britain: African soldiers in the Second World War|year=2010|publisher=James Currey|location=Woodbridge, Suffolk|isbn=978-1-84701-015-5|page=7}}</ref> The Congo underwent an economic boom in the 1920s and mines, plantations, and transportation networks were greatly developed. The [[Great Depression]] led to a collapse of commodity prices, undermining the colony's export-based economy and leading to a large reduction in income and employment.

Though Ryckmans declared that he would continue to support the Allied cause, the Belgian government in Bordeaux was deeply disheartened by the French surrender.{{sfn|Van der Wee|Verbreyt|2009|pp=72, 231}} Prime Minister [[Hubert Pierlot]] believed that it lacked the resources to continue to fight and thus it would be better to negotiate a peace with Germany instead of going into exile in the United Kingdom. Most of the ministers agreed, though de Vleeschauwer dissented. While the government prepared to negotiate with Germany, representatives of various Belgo-Congolese companies in Bordeaux informed the ministers of rumours that should Belgium surrender, the United Kingdom would seize control of the Congo.{{sfn|Van der Wee|Verbreyt|2009|pp=72\u201373}}\n\nThe British were determined that the Congo should not fall into Axis hands, and planned to invade and occupy the colony if the Belgians did not come to an arrangement. This was particularly because the Allies were desperate for raw materials like [[natural rubber|rubber]] which the Congo could produce in abundance.<ref name=Veranneman81/> On 20 June the British Foreign Secretary told the Belgian ambassador in London that the United Kingdom would not accept German dominance over the colony.{{sfn|Van der Wee|Verbreyt|2009|p=231}} Meanwhile, the Belgo-Congolese businessmen proposed that de Vleeschauwer go to London to ensure that Belgian sovereignty over the Congo would be respected. Pierlot suggested that de Vleeschauwer should be granted the new title of Administrator-general of the Congo, allowing him to pursue this cause even if the government later collapsed and his ministerial mandate became void. The government agreed to the idea and de Vleeschauwer departed for London, arriving on 4 July.{{sfn|Van der Wee|Verbreyt|2009|pp=73\u201374, 232}} He spoke with members of the British government and assured them that he would place all of the Congo's raw materials at the disposal of the United Kingdom's war effort. Over the following months Pierlot and two other ministers managed to reach London while the rest declared their intention to remain in France and resign. In October Pierlot, de Vleeschauwer, and the two other ministers officially established the [[Belgian government in exile]], recognised by the United Kingdom.{{sfn|Van der Wee|Verbreyt|2009|pp=232\u2013233}} Despite his presence, De Vleeschauwer was politically marginalised by Finance Minister [[Camille Gutt]] and played little role thereafter in the government.{{sfn|Van der Wee|Verbreyt|2009|pp=237\u2013238}}\n\n==Economic contribution==\n{{Quote box|width=246px|bgcolor=#c6dbf7|align=right|quote=\"The Belgian Congo has entered the service of the Allies.

Despite Belgium's surrender, the Congo remained in the conflict on the [[Allies (World War II)|Allied side]], administered by the [[Belgian government in exile]], and provided much-needed raw materials, most notably [[gold]] and [[uranium]], to the United Kingdom and the United States.\n\nCongolese troops of the ''[[Force Publique]]'' fought alongside British forces in the [[East African Campaign (World War II)|East African Campaign]], and a Congolese medical unit served in [[Battle of Madagascar|Madagascar]] and in the [[Burma Campaign]]. Congolese formations also acted as garrisons in [[Kingdom of Egypt|Egypt]], [[Colony and Protectorate of Nigeria|Nigeria]] and [[Mandatory Palestine|Palestine]].\n\nThe increasing demands placed on the Congolese population by the colonial authorities during the war, however, provoked strikes, riots and other forms of resistance, particularly from the indigenous Congolese. These were repressed, often violently, by the Belgian colonial authorities. The Congo's comparative prosperity during the conflict led to a wave of post-war immigration from Belgium, bringing the white population to 100,000 by 1950, as well as a period of industrialisation that continued throughout the 1950s. The role played by Congolese uranium during the hostilities caused the country to be of interest to the [[Soviet Union]] during the [[Cold War]].\n\n==Background==\n{{main|Battle of Belgium|German occupation of Belgium during World War II}}\n[[File:Monument Albert Kinshasa 5.JPG|thumb|Colonial officials, including the Governor-General, [[Pierre Ryckmans (Governor-General)|Pierre Ryckmans]], in [[Kinshasa|L\u00e9opoldville]] in 1938.]]\n\nFollowing World War I, Belgium possessed two colonies in Africa: the [[Belgian Congo]], which it had controlled since its annexation of the [[Congo Free State]] in 1908, and [[Ruanda-Urundi]], a former German colony that had been mandated to Belgium in 1924 by the [[League of Nations]].<ref name=Larousse1>{{cite web|title=Empire Colonial Belge|url=http://www.larousse.fr/encyclopedie/autre-region/Empire_colonial_belge/182725|publisher=[[\u00c9ditions Larousse]]|work=Online Encyclopedia|accessdate=17 July 2013}}</ref> The Belgian colonial military numbered 18,000 soldiers, making it one of the largest standing colonial armies in Africa at the time.<ref name=Killingray7>{{cite book|last=Killingray|first=David|title=Fighting for Britain: African soldiers in the Second World War|year=2010|publisher=James Currey|location=Woodbridge, Suffolk|isbn=978-1-84701-015-5|page=7}}</ref> The Congo underwent an economic boom in the 1920s and mines, plantations, and transportation networks were greatly developed.

Most of the ministers agreed, though de Vleeschauwer dissented. While the government prepared to negotiate with Germany, representatives of various Belgo-Congolese companies in Bordeaux informed the ministers of rumours that should Belgium surrender, the United Kingdom would seize control of the Congo.{{sfn|Van der Wee|Verbreyt|2009|pp=72\u201373}}\n\nThe British were determined that the Congo should not fall into Axis hands, and planned to invade and occupy the colony if the Belgians did not come to an arrangement. This was particularly because the Allies were desperate for raw materials like [[natural rubber|rubber]] which the Congo could produce in abundance.<ref name=Veranneman81/> On 20 June the British Foreign Secretary told the Belgian ambassador in London that the United Kingdom would not accept German dominance over the colony.{{sfn|Van der Wee|Verbreyt|2009|p=231}} Meanwhile, the Belgo-Congolese businessmen proposed that de Vleeschauwer go to London to ensure that Belgian sovereignty over the Congo would be respected. Pierlot suggested that de Vleeschauwer should be granted the new title of Administrator-general of the Congo, allowing him to pursue this cause even if the government later collapsed and his ministerial mandate became void. The government agreed to the idea and de Vleeschauwer departed for London, arriving on 4 July.{{sfn|Van der Wee|Verbreyt|2009|pp=73\u201374, 232}} He spoke with members of the British government and assured them that he would place all of the Congo's raw materials at the disposal of the United Kingdom's war effort. Over the following months Pierlot and two other ministers managed to reach London while the rest declared their intention to remain in France and resign. In October Pierlot, de Vleeschauwer, and the two other ministers officially established the [[Belgian government in exile]], recognised by the United Kingdom.{{sfn|Van der Wee|Verbreyt|2009|pp=232\u2013233}} Despite his presence, De Vleeschauwer was politically marginalised by Finance Minister [[Camille Gutt]] and played little role thereafter in the government.{{sfn|Van der Wee|Verbreyt|2009|pp=237\u2013238}}\n\n==Economic contribution==\n{{Quote box|width=246px|bgcolor=#c6dbf7|align=right|quote=\"The Belgian Congo has entered the service of the Allies.
