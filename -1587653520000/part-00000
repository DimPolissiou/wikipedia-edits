The runway of the old airport can still be seen and half of it is used as the connecting road for the stadium.\n\n===New airport===\n[[File:Sibu Airport check-in counter.JPG|thumb|left|The check-in counters after upgrade completion]]\nOperation of the new airport officially began 1 June 1994. On 31 May 1994 the inaugural landing of four [[Malaysia Airlines]] aircraft occurred. The aircraft were three Fokker 50 and a [[Boeing 737]]. They were the pioneers to land on the Sibu New Airport runway which at that time measured {{Convert|1981|x|45|m|abbr=on|0}}.\n\nOn that remarkably historical night, the air traffic clearance \"Clear to land\" was issued from the Sibu Air Traffic Control Tower on the assigned frequency 122.6&nbsp;MHz to the first Boeing 737-500 to land on the asphalt surface of the designated runway 13.\n\nThat night not only marked the first landing of a turbo-prop commercial aircraft on Sibu ground but subsequently it also commemorated the commencement of operation of the new airport located {{Convert|23|km|abbr=on}} east south east<ref name=AIP/> Sibu town.\n\nSibu New Airport was built with a single runway designated as runway 13/31. It was previously {{Convert|1981|x|45|m|abbr=on|0}} but since the completion of the extension under the 7th Malaysian Plan (RMK7) for 'Sibu Airport Development Plan', the length was extended to {{convert|2745|m|abbr=on|0}}, and the new runway length was commissioned for use on 9 May 2006. The extended length is able to cater to landing of an Airbus A330 or other wide bodied jet aircraft.\n\nRunway 13 is equipped with an approach lighting system called Precision Approach Lighting Category 1, whereas runway 31 with Simple Approach Lighting System. The other airside areas such as the taxiways (\u2018A\u2019 and \u2018B\u2019) and apron are also furnished with appropriate lighting aids. The maximum capacity of the parking apron is one Airbus, two Boeing 737-400s, two Fokker 50 and two Twin Otter or similar aircraft. Only bay 2 and 3 are equipped with aerobridges functioning on Visual Docking and Guidance System. The functional runway is also equipped with landing aids such as the Middle Marker (MM), Glide Path (GP), the Localizer (LLZ) and the PAPI. All the stated instruments are installed to be utilised by aircraft to assist them during the final approach process and landing manoeuvres.<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20120225101130/http://www.dca-sarawak.gov.my/Airport/Sibu%20Airport/Sibu%20Airport_History.htm Sibu Airport: History] at the Wayback Machine</ref>\n\n===Expansion project===\n\nThe airport underwent an expansion project that involved upgrading of the terminal building, car park and the addition of more aerobridges.

The runway of the old airport can still be seen and half of it is used as the connecting road for the stadium.\n\n===New airport===\n[[File:Sibu Airport check-in counter.JPG|thumb|left|The check-in counters after upgrade completion]]\nOperation of the new airport officially began 1 June 1994. On 31 May 1994 the inaugural landing of four [[Malaysia Airlines]] aircraft occurred. The aircraft were three Fokker 50 and a [[Boeing 737]]. They were the pioneers to land on the Sibu New Airport runway which at that time measured {{Convert|1981|x|45|m|abbr=on|0}}.\n\nOn that remarkably historical night, the air traffic clearance \"Clear to land\" was issued from the Sibu Air Traffic Control Tower on the assigned frequency 122.6&nbsp;MHz to the first Boeing 737-500 to land on the asphalt surface of the designated runway 13.\n\nThat night not only marked the first landing of a turbo-prop commercial aircraft on Sibu ground but subsequently it also commemorated the commencement of operation of the new airport located {{Convert|23|km|abbr=on}} east south east<ref name=AIP/> Sibu town.\n\nSibu New Airport was built with a single runway designated as runway 13/31. It was previously {{Convert|1981|x|45|m|abbr=on|0}} but since the completion of the extension under the 7th Malaysian Plan (RMK7) for 'Sibu Airport Development Plan', the length was extended to {{convert|2745|m|abbr=on|0}}, and the new runway length was commissioned for use on 9 May 2006. The extended length is able to cater to landing of an Airbus A330 or other wide bodied jet aircraft.\n\nRunway 13 is equipped with an approach lighting system called Precision Approach Lighting Category 1, whereas runway 31 with Simple Approach Lighting System. The other airside areas such as the taxiways (\u2018A\u2019 and \u2018B\u2019) and apron are also furnished with appropriate lighting aids. The maximum capacity of the parking apron is one Airbus, two Boeing 737-400s, two Fokker 50 and two Twin Otter or similar aircraft. Only bay 2 and 3 are equipped with aerobridges functioning on Visual Docking and Guidance System. The functional runway is also equipped with landing aids such as the Middle Marker (MM), Glide Path (GP), the Localizer (LLZ) and the PAPI. All the stated instruments are installed to be utilised by aircraft to assist them during the final approach process and landing manoeuvres.<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20120225101130/http://www.dca-sarawak.gov.my/Airport/Sibu%20Airport/Sibu%20Airport_History.htm Sibu Airport: History] at the Wayback Machine</ref>\n\n===Expansion project===\n\nThe airport underwent an expansion project that involved upgrading of the terminal building, car park and the addition of more aerobridges.

He is the executive director of marketing for the Outdoor Man chain of sporting goods stores, with an office based in the Denver \"flagship\" store. He supports traditional American values, is a [[Protestantism in the United States|Protestant]] and is politically [[Conservatism in the United States|conservative]]. Mike loves his daughters but says his favorite is Eve, the youngest and most athletic daughter, and whose political opinions and interests mirror his own. He is proud of her ability to excel at anything she tries, including schoolwork, hunting, and sports. Mike often finds himself annoyed with Outdoor Man's young goofball employee Kyle (who later becomes his son-in-law), and with Ryan, his atheist and politically [[Modern liberalism in the United States|liberal]] son-in-law married to his oldest daughter, and the father of his grandson Boyd. The video blog or \"vlog\" that Mike does for Outdoor Man is frequently used as a vehicle to express his political and social views. Mike is a graduate of the [[University of Michigan]], and an amateur radio operator using the call sign KA0XTT.<ref>{{cite web |publisher=[[American Radio Relay League]] |url=http://www.arrl.org/news/em-ham-radio-in-hollywood-em-comedian-tim-allen-stars-as-radio-amateur-on-new-tv-show |title=Ham Radio in Hollywood: Comedian Tim Allen Stars as Radio Amateur on New TV Show |date=December 12, 2011}}</ref>\n* [[Nancy Travis]] as Vanessa Baxter (n\u00e9e Davidson), Mike's wife: Vanessa is a [[Geology|geologist]] working in the energy industry for a company that does [[hydraulic fracturing]], or \"fracking\". In season four, Vanessa becomes frustrated with her job and decides to go back to college to become a high-school science teacher. This is one example of the myriad of ideas Vanessa comes up with(the most damaging was her suggesting to Mandy that she join her old sorority and dump Kyle, which gives Mandy an excuse to cut class and drives a rift between Kyle and Vanessa). After being laid off as a teacher due to budget cuts, Vanessa begins her own tutoring business.  Vanessa was ambiguous in her political views(often idiotically agreeing with both sides) until season five, when she announced her support of [[Hillary Clinton]] for president, mainly because she thinks it will advance women's causes. She is frequently shown drinking copious amounts of wine, and is also frequently mocked by Mike and her daughters about it. She is a graduate of [[Ohio State University]] with a [[Master of Science]] degree in Physics and a [[PhD]] in Geology, and thus advanced farther in college than did Mike. She endlessly brags about her alma mater and her extensive history of boyfriends (all of whom dumped her). Vanessa often makes attempts to be politically correct, but when trying to relate to people of other races, she generally winds up with her foot in her mouth. Despite this, she and her African-American neighbor Carol Larabee seem to get along. Vanessa's humor includes [[punning]], which amuses her greatly but irritates Mike and the girls. Constantly feeling overshadowed by Mike, she will often spout something useless or inappropriate, just to horn in on the conversation. For the same reason, Vanessa has very few reservations about deceiving or manipulating Mike to get her way, and enjoys rubbing his nose in it if she does. Vanessa and Eve do not connect well (mainly because Eve holds beliefs nearly identical to Mike's).\n* [[Amanda Fuller]] (seasons 2\u2013present<ref>{{cite web|url=https://tvline.com/2018/07/02/last-man-standing-molly-ephraim-season-7-mandy-recast/|title=Last Man Standing Shake-Up: 2 Major Roles Being Recast Ahead of Season 7|first=Michael|last=Ausiello|date=July 2, 2018|publisher=}}</ref>) and [[Alexandra Krosney]] (season 1) as Kristin Beth Baxter, the oldest daughter. Krosney portrayed Kristin in the show's first season (despite being nearly two years younger than Molly Ephraim, who played her younger sister Mandy); Krosney was replaced by Fuller before season two for unspecified creative reasons.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://tvline.com/2012/06/11/last-man-standing-alexandra-krosney-leaving|title=Exclusive: Alexandra Krosney Exits ''Last Man Standing'', Role Recast|first=Michael|last=Ausiello|work=tvline.com|date=June 11, 2012|accessdate=November 14, 2012}}</ref>  Kristin, unlike her father, espouses liberal political views and her views with regard to Christianity seem ambiguous. During her senior year of high school, Kristin became pregnant with her son Boyd. She was a single mother living in the Baxter home until she moved out in the season-two finale. She began to reconcile with Boyd's father, Ryan Vogelson, in season three, and the two get married between seasons four and five. Kristin worked at a diner until landing a job at an upscale restaurant run by a former co-worker at the end of season two. In season four, she becomes the manager of the new wild game restaurant opened by Outdoor Man. Kristin tends to work extra hard in this new job to prove she did not get the position through nepotism, despite Mike and Ed frequently telling her she was qualified. At the start of season 8, Kristin announced that she is expecting her second child, and only trusted Mike with the secret of it being a girl. Amanda Fuller will be directing the eighth season finale, which is reported to be a cliffhanger involving her baby's arrival.\n* [[Molly Ephraim]] (seasons 1\u20136) and Molly McCook (season 7-present)<ref name=recast>{{cite web|url=https://variety.com/2018/tv/news/last-man-standing-molly-ephraim-flynn-morrison-1202863659/|title=Tim \u2018Last Man Standing\u2019 Regulars Molly Ephraim, Flynn Morrison Exit Ahead of Season 7, Roles to Be Recast |last=Otterson |first=Joe |publisher=variety.com |date=July 2, 2018 |access-date=July 3, 2018}}</ref> as Amanda Elaine \"Mandy\" Baxter-Anderson, the middle daughter: Mandy is not as academic as her sisters (and she has a penchant for cutting class and ignoring homework), but she excels in social situations. Interested in fashion and little else, she was one of the most popular girls at her high school. Mandy is very confident and creative, demonstrating traits found in her father. She is also lazy, conceited, promiscuous, insulting, and delinquent&nbsp;\u2013 she drinks underage, ignores all driving laws, shoplifts from Outdoor Man, there are many implications that she has smoked cannabis, and she has been caught staying out all night&nbsp;\u2013 but occasionally she can display moments of generosity and caring. (She flew a relative of Blanca's home from Afghanistan one Christmas, and gave a homeless woman a makeover so she could ace a job interview.) Her bragging suggests that she has dated and/or slept with most of the boys in her high school, as well as some of the male teachers. Despite this, Mandy started dating Kyle in Season 2. As of Season 3, she attends a local college and works at the diner where Kristin used to work. It has been intimated that she has [[ADHD]] when she takes some of Boyd's ADD medication and starts doing well on her college tests. Later that same season, she begins an online clothing business, selling her self-designed fashions which she assembles in the basement of her parents' house. Kyle asks her to marry him in Season 5, the 100th episode. She marries Kyle in Season 6, and they lived in the Baxter home until the finale of season 7. Up until she turned 21, a running gag on the show was Mike, Vanessa, and occasionally Kristin snatching glasses of alcohol out of Mandy's hand, usually followed by Mandy making a lame excuse. Ephraim was replaced by Molly McCook prior to the Season 7 revival on FOX due to Ephraim choosing not to return.<ref name=recast /> Since her marriage, Mandy has done everything possible to avoid conceiving a child, but never bothering to tell husband Kyle that she's not ready for parenthood. That changes at the start of season 8, when she confides that she and Kyle are trying for real to conceive. Also in season 8, Mandy gets an opportunity to design a new casual clothing line for Outdoor Man.\n* [[Kaitlyn Dever]] as Eve Baxter, (series regular, seasons 1\u20136; recurring, season 7-present)<ref>{{cite web |title=Last Man Standing EP Laments That 'Unfortunate' Cast Departure |url=https://tvline.com/2018/08/02/molly-ephraim-leaving-last-man-standing-season-7-mandy-recast/ |website=TV Line |publisher=TV Line |accessdate=2 August 2018}}</ref> the youngest daughter: Eve is intelligent and athletic, and generally has the same interests as Mike, including camping, sports, guns, and the military. She also has [[Conservatism in the United States|conservative]] views like Mike. She is Mike's favorite daughter, and excels at her hobbies. She frequently outplays the boys in soccer and makes the boys' football team as their placekicker. She is well aware of being the favorite over her two sisters. Eve also shares her father's sense of humor, and her sarcastic wit is frequently directed at clueless sister Mandy. Eve is an excellent student, whose only weak subject is art, though she did have to change math classes to escape a prejudiced, anti-female teacher. Eve is a member of [[Junior Reserve Officers' Training Corps|Army Junior ROTC]] and works toward gaining admittance to [[United States Military Academy|West Point]]. Her attempt to do so is unsuccessful, which seriously depresses her, so in season six, Eve decides to take a \"personal year\" rather than immediately attend college. She spends some of this time singing and playing guitar for money, but this proves to be unfruitful. She had more success working at Outdoor Man and volunteering for a [[Habitat for Humanity]]-style local charity. During her gap year, Eve applies to the [[United States Air Force Academy|Air Force Academy]] in nearby [[Colorado Springs]] (without telling either parent), and is accepted. Over her mother's objections, Eve chooses to enlist in the Academy. In season seven, Cadet 4th Class Baxter is only a recurring character as she is now enrolled at the Academy. (This was due to Dever's commitments to the [[Netflix]] miniseries ''[[Unbelievable (miniseries)|Unbelievable]]''.) Due to Dever's continued busy schedule, Eve is again a recurring character in Season 8.<ref>{{cite web |title=Last Man Standing's Kaitlyn Dever Poised to Appear in Fewer Season 8 Episodes: 'She Is Just Crazy Busy' |url=https://tvline.com/2019/12/22/last-man-standing-season-8-eve-baxter-less-episodes-kaitlyn-dever/ |website=TV Line |last=Schwartz |first=Ryan |date=2019-12-22 |accessdate=2020-04-22}}</ref>\n* [[Christoph Sanders]] as Kyle Anderson, a young employee at Outdoor Man: Kyle is universally recognized as a [[Nice guy|good guy]]. Kyle idolizes Mike, having grown up without a father figure, but Mike is mostly irritated by Kyle's personality and behavior. Kyle takes care of his grandmother who has [[dementia]], and it is implied he grew up in her home. His estranged mother passes away in season six, leaving Kyle with mixed feelings over how to deal with it. Kyle is often oblivious to social cues and is slow to catch on to the events happening around him. Kyle dated Kristin in season one and started dating Mandy in season two before proposing in season five, and marrying Mandy in season six. Kyle was shuffled from role to role at Outdoor Man, sometimes messing up due to his trusting nature. In season seven, Mike and Ed experiment with putting him in an HR role, and find that Kyle's combination of people skills and strict adherence to company guidelines makes him a good fit for the position. As of season seven, he has yet to level his mother's trailer or break ground on building his own home, although he and Mandy moved into an apartment at the end of that season. Kyle has mentioned that he and Mandy are trying to conceive a baby, unaware that Mandy has reservations about it and has yet to discontinue birth control. That changes at the start of season 8, when Mandy confides that she and Kyle are trying for real to conceive.\n* [[H\u00e9ctor Elizondo]] as Edward \"Ed\" Alzate, Mike's longtime business partner: Ed started a [[Fish bait|bait]] and [[Fishing tackle|tackle]] shop many years ago and hired Mike, who helped turn the shop into the 20-store Outdoor Man chain.<ref>{{cite episode|title=Rediscover America|series=Last Man Standing|credits=Vince Calandra (writer) & [[Victor Gonzalez (director)|Victor Gonzalez]] (director)|network=[[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]]|airdate=October 10, 2014|season=4|number=3}}</ref> Ed is perhaps fifteen years older than Mike, but the two men bond over similar outdoor hobbies and shared conservative values. He is of [[Basque people|Basque]] heritage, something which he takes great pride in and brings up whenever possible. Mike regularly talks to Ed about the happenings in his home and occasionally seeks advice. Having been divorced four times, Ed's suggestions on relationships are rarely helpful. Despite his status as Outdoor Man \"founder\", Ed has very little business sense (often following fly-by-night promotional trends) and sometimes lacks tact with female customers and employees. Thus, Outdoor Man's success is mainly due to Mike's intelligence and ability to resolve conflicts (sometimes requiring him to pull Ed's foot out of his mouth). He also has five daughters (and a war baby). Ed is a [[Vietnam veteran]], although he saw no combat in Vietnam, stating that he was a clerk in Saigon. He continues to help fellow veterans at the local [[Veterans of Foreign Wars]] hall with their [[United States Department of Veterans Affairs|Veteran Affairs]] paperwork. Ed is also a recurring target for jokes about his age and lack of hair, most often from Mike. Early in Season 7, Ed announces his retirement from Outdoor Man, but still comes in when activities with people his own age bore him, which is often. Also in Season 7, he meets, falls for, and becomes engaged to Vanessa's mother, Bonnie, whom he marries early in Season 8.\n* Flynn Morrison (regular, seasons 2\u20136), [[Jet Jurgensmeyer]] (season 7)<ref name=recast /> (recurring, season 8) and Evan and Luke Kruntchev (recurring, season 1) as Boyd Baxter, son of Kristin and Ryan: Mike enjoys spending quality time with his grandson Boyd, and affectionately views him as the son he never had. Mike and Ryan often clash on how he should be raised. Boyd enjoys activities encouraged by both his father and grandfather.\n* [[Jordan Masterson]] (regular, seasons 4\u2013present; recurring, seasons 2\u20133) and [[Nick Jonas]] (guest star, season 1) as Ryan Vogelson, Boyd's Canadian father: Though Ryan initially fled the country when Kristin fell pregnant, he returned five years later to be involved in Boyd's upbringing (though for next three years he was the personification of a 'deadbeat dad'), and eventually the two reconciled and got engaged (at the end of season 3). Ryan holds liberal views, both politically and philosophically, and he and Mike routinely clash over their fundamentally opposing values, especially when it comes to child-rearing. Ryan wishes to raise his son without religion, hunting culture and national pride, however, neither Mike nor Kristin agree with this approach. His vegan diet, views on discipline, love for all liberal policies, and what Mike sees as his oversensitivity are an affront to Mike's beliefs, but Ryan generally enjoys being a thorn in Mike's side, as well as infuriating the entire family when he mocks their belief in God. Ryan also infuriates the entire family by trying to force his will on Boyd's elementary school, trying to ban things like dodgeball, soda, and worst of all, [[The Pledge of Allegiance]]. On rare occasions, Ryan and Mike agree on what is best for Boyd, but this usually puts them at odds with Kristin or Vanessa. Mike comes to reluctantly respect and like his son-in-law for standing up for what he believes, and for being a loving husband and father. At the beginning of Season 7, Ryan threatens to run back to Canada with Kristin and Boyd over his hatred of President Trump's leadership, until Mike encourages him to apply for U.S. citizenship. (This suggests that for all the time Ryan has been in Boyd's life, he's been an illegal alien). Upon Bud Baxter's passing, Ryan assumes ownership and operation of the marijuana store, with Mike's blessing. He later rents the upper floor of the marijuana store to Mandy and Kyle as an apartment, becoming their landlord.\n* [[Jonathan Adams (American actor)|Jonathan Adams]] as Chuck Larabee (regular, seasons 4\u2013present; recurring, seasons 2\u20133), Mike and Vanessa's neighbor: Chuck is a retired [[Marine (military)|U.S. Marine]] and a veteran of the first [[Gulf War]] who runs a private security business and later takes charge of security for the Denver Outdoor Man. Chuck is an African-American who grew up in [[Minneapolis]], and often jokes with Mike about racial stereotypes. The two regularly exchange barbs as if they don't like each other. In reality, they are good friends, despite being unwilling to admit it. Vanessa sees through their heated exchanges, often telling them to \"get a room\". Chuck's typical response to something or someone that exasperates him is, \"not cool\". Like Mike, Chuck enjoys repairing and restoring cars, something he learned by assisting his father for many years. Chuck is married to Carol and they have a son, Brandon, who is the same age as Eve.\n* [[Krista Marie Yu]] as Jen (season 7\u2013present), Vanessa's foreign-exchange student from Hong Kong who moves in with the Baxters in season 7.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://deadline.com/2019/01/last-man-standing-krista-yu-promoted-series-regular-fox-tim-allen-1202537375/|title='Last Man Standing': Krista Marie Yu Promoted To Regular On Fox Series|publisher=Deadline|author=Denise Petski|date=January 18, 2019|accessdate=February 4, 2019}}</ref> At first, she is shy and goes along with everything Mike wants, but Mike challenges her to be confident and to stand up for what she wants. As opposed to the Baxter girls, Jen is very passive-aggressive, often giving backhanded compliments or subtly dropping slams against what she perceives as the foolishness of Vanessa and her daughters (mainly Mandy). As of Season 8, Jen is a high school senior and begins kissing up to Vanessa at every opportunity. It's later revealed that Jen is interested in geology, like Vanessa, and has applied to attend the Rocky Mountain Geological Institute.\n\n==Recurring cast==\n* [[Robert Forster]] as Bud Baxter (seasons 1, 3\u20134, 7), Mike's widower father who is initially in the construction business, but later opens a marijuana store (\"Bud's Buds\") after it becomes legal in Colorado. In season 7, it is revealed that Bud died of a heart attack(Forster would succumb to brain cancer a year later, so it's possible that he left the show seeking treatment for this). Ryan, lacking a job after he stopped home-schooling Boyd, takes over the pot shop.\n* [[Christina Moore]] as April (seasons 1 & 3), Vanessa's air-headed and immature younger sister. She is always asking for money, and once wanted to have a child despite having no means of supporting it.\n* [[Danielle Bisutti]] as Michelle (season 1), Vanessa's pseudo-friend and next-door neighbor; she is a local weathergirl who acquires most of her data from a free phone app.\n* [[Erika Alexander]] (seasons 2\u20136) and [[Tisha Campbell-Martin|Tisha Campbell]] (season 7\u2013) as Carol Larabee, Chuck's wife and Mike and Vanessa's neighbor, who becomes Vanessa's best friend. Vanessa often goes overboard trying to act racially open-minded around her, but usually ends up with her foot in her mouth, annoying Carol. In season 6, Carol accepts a year-long job in California, leaving Chuck behind in Denver. She returns in season 7, and the two renew their wedding vows.\n* [[Carla Jimenez]] as Blanca Alvarez (seasons 2\u20134), the Baxters' Guatemalan-born housekeeper who also helps Mandy with her fashion business. The Baxters were happy to celebrate with Blanca after she was sworn in as an American citizen. Her disappearance has never been explained.\n* [[Sarah Gilman]] as Cammy Harris (seasons 2\u20136), Eve's soccer teammate and extremely chatty best friend. It is hinted by Mandy in season 4's \"Restaurant Opening\" that Cammy has a full-on crush for Eve that goes beyond friendship. This leads to Eve avoiding Cammy for a while, though Cammy later insists she would never do anything to make Eve uncomfortable. Cammy also briefly led a three-piece band (with Eve on guitar) called the \"Cammy Harris Experience\". When Cammy and drummer Nigel chickened out at their first gig, Eve performed a solo song that impressed both Mike and the club owner.\n* [[Jonathan Taylor Thomas]] as John Baker (seasons 2\u20133), Kristin's boss at a fancy restaurant where she works. Thomas also had a cameo as \"Randy\" (a nod to his ''[[Home Improvement (TV series)|Home Improvement]]'' character) in the season 4 episode \"Helen Potts\", with fellow ''Home Improvement'' co-star [[Patricia Richardson]]. Since the writing out of John Baker, Jonathan Taylor Thomas has directed multiple episodes of the series.\n* [[Tye Sheridan]] as Justin (seasons 3\u20134), Eve's fellow Jr. ROTC member and football teammate who becomes her boyfriend. The two break up in season 4.\n* [[Zachary Gordon]] as Andrew (season 3), Eve's nerdy classmate who worships her and desperately wants to be her boyfriend. He became her prom date when Justin pushed her too far.\n* [[Joely Fisher]] as Wendi Gracin (seasons 3\u20135), Ed's obnoxious younger girlfriend, whom he meets near the end of season three. Ed routinely has to put her in her place, particularly when she shows up at the store and tries to get involved in running his business (her agenda usually involves denigrating Mike). Wendi deserts Ed offscreen between Seasons 4 and 5, but the two patch things up and reunite. When the series returned for a seventh season, Wendi was not seen or mentioned. It is understood that she and Ed broke up, as Ed dates and later becomes engaged to Vanessa's mother, Bonnie, during that season.\n* [[Bill Engvall]] as Reverend Paul (seasons 5\u2013present), the new pastor of the Baxter family's church, who enjoys hustling donations out of Mike. (Nancy Travis played Bill's wife Susan on three seasons of ''[[The Bill Engvall Show]]'')\n* [[Jay Leno]] as Joe Leonard (seasons 5\u2013present), a semi-retired auto technician from whom Vanessa buys a classic car for Mike. Joe later works in the repair shop at Outdoor Man, servicing products like ATVs, snowmobiles and boat engines. Joe enjoys throwing humorous insults at Mike, often teaming up with Chuck in these exchanges. He is depicted as lonely, living with several cats, and is very close to his mother.\n* [[Travis Tope]] as Rob (season 6), Eve's boyfriend who is studying criminal justice at [[UC Boulder]]. He's a recovering alcoholic, which worries Mike and Vanessa when they first meet him. Shortly before Eve left for the Air Force Academy, Vanessa's nosy meddling ruined their relationship.\n\n==Notable guest stars==\nSeveral notable guest stars have appeared throughout the series, including appearances made from cast members of Tim Allen's previous series, ''[[Home Improvement (TV series)|Home Improvement]]''.\n\n* [[Paul F.

He is the executive director of marketing for the Outdoor Man chain of sporting goods stores, with an office based in the Denver \"flagship\" store. He supports traditional American values, is a [[Protestantism in the United States|Protestant]] and is politically [[Conservatism in the United States|conservative]]. Mike loves his daughters but says his favorite is Eve, the youngest and most athletic daughter, and whose political opinions and interests mirror his own. He is proud of her ability to excel at anything she tries, including schoolwork, hunting, and sports. Mike often finds himself annoyed with Outdoor Man's young goofball employee Kyle (who later becomes his son-in-law), and with Ryan, his atheist and politically [[Modern liberalism in the United States|liberal]] son-in-law married to his oldest daughter, and the father of his grandson Boyd. The video blog or \"vlog\" that Mike does for Outdoor Man is frequently used as a vehicle to express his political and social views. Mike is a graduate of the [[University of Michigan]], and an amateur radio operator using the call sign KA0XTT.<ref>{{cite web |publisher=[[American Radio Relay League]] |url=http://www.arrl.org/news/em-ham-radio-in-hollywood-em-comedian-tim-allen-stars-as-radio-amateur-on-new-tv-show |title=Ham Radio in Hollywood: Comedian Tim Allen Stars as Radio Amateur on New TV Show |date=December 12, 2011}}</ref>\n* [[Nancy Travis]] as Vanessa Baxter (n\u00e9e Davidson), Mike's wife: Vanessa is a [[Geology|geologist]] working in the energy industry for a company that does [[hydraulic fracturing]], or \"fracking\". In season four, Vanessa becomes frustrated with her job and decides to go back to college to become a high-school science teacher. This is one example of the myriad of ideas Vanessa comes up with(the most damaging was her suggesting to Mandy that she join her old sorority and dump Kyle, which gives Mandy an excuse to cut class and drives a rift between Kyle and Vanessa). After being laid off as a teacher due to budget cuts, Vanessa begins her own tutoring business.  Vanessa was ambiguous in her political views(often idiotically agreeing with both sides) until season five, when she announced her support of [[Hillary Clinton]] for president, mainly because she thinks it will advance women's causes. She is frequently shown drinking copious amounts of wine, and is also frequently mocked by Mike and her daughters about it. She is a graduate of [[Ohio State University]] with a [[Master of Science]] degree in Physics and a [[PhD]] in Geology, and thus advanced farther in college than did Mike. She endlessly brags about her alma mater and her extensive history of boyfriends (all of whom dumped her). Vanessa often makes attempts to be politically correct, but when trying to relate to people of other races, she generally winds up with her foot in her mouth. Despite this, she and her African-American neighbor Carol Larabee seem to get along. Vanessa's humor includes [[punning]], which amuses her greatly but irritates Mike and the girls. Constantly feeling overshadowed by Mike, she will often spout something useless or inappropriate, just to horn in on the conversation. For the same reason, Vanessa has very few reservations about deceiving or manipulating Mike to get her way, and enjoys rubbing his nose in it if she does. Vanessa and Eve do not connect well (mainly because Eve holds beliefs nearly identical to Mike's).\n* [[Amanda Fuller]] (seasons 2\u2013present<ref>{{cite web|url=https://tvline.com/2018/07/02/last-man-standing-molly-ephraim-season-7-mandy-recast/|title=Last Man Standing Shake-Up: 2 Major Roles Being Recast Ahead of Season 7|first=Michael|last=Ausiello|date=July 2, 2018|publisher=}}</ref>) and [[Alexandra Krosney]] (season 1) as Kristin Beth Baxter, the oldest daughter. Krosney portrayed Kristin in the show's first season (despite being nearly two years younger than Molly Ephraim, who played her younger sister Mandy); Krosney was replaced by Fuller before season two for unspecified creative reasons.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://tvline.com/2012/06/11/last-man-standing-alexandra-krosney-leaving|title=Exclusive: Alexandra Krosney Exits ''Last Man Standing'', Role Recast|first=Michael|last=Ausiello|work=tvline.com|date=June 11, 2012|accessdate=November 14, 2012}}</ref>  Kristin, unlike her father, espouses liberal political views and her views with regard to Christianity seem ambiguous. During her senior year of high school, Kristin became pregnant with her son Boyd. She was a single mother living in the Baxter home until she moved out in the season-two finale. She began to reconcile with Boyd's father, Ryan Vogelson, in season three, and the two get married between seasons four and five. Kristin worked at a diner until landing a job at an upscale restaurant run by a former co-worker at the end of season two. In season four, she becomes the manager of the new wild game restaurant opened by Outdoor Man. Kristin tends to work extra hard in this new job to prove she did not get the position through nepotism, despite Mike and Ed frequently telling her she was qualified. At the start of season 8, Kristin announced that she is expecting her second child, and only trusted Mike with the secret of it being a girl. Amanda Fuller will be directing the eighth season finale, which is reported to be a cliffhanger involving her baby's arrival.\n* [[Molly Ephraim]] (seasons 1\u20136) and Molly McCook (season 7-present)<ref name=recast>{{cite web|url=https://variety.com/2018/tv/news/last-man-standing-molly-ephraim-flynn-morrison-1202863659/|title=Tim \u2018Last Man Standing\u2019 Regulars Molly Ephraim, Flynn Morrison Exit Ahead of Season 7, Roles to Be Recast |last=Otterson |first=Joe |publisher=variety.com |date=July 2, 2018 |access-date=July 3, 2018}}</ref> as Amanda Elaine \"Mandy\" Baxter-Anderson, the middle daughter: Mandy is not as academic as her sisters (and she has a penchant for cutting class and ignoring homework), but she excels in social situations. Interested in fashion and little else, she was one of the most popular girls at her high school. Mandy is very confident and creative, demonstrating traits found in her father. She is also lazy, conceited, promiscuous, insulting, and delinquent&nbsp;\u2013 she drinks underage, ignores all driving laws, shoplifts from Outdoor Man, there are many implications that she has smoked cannabis, and she has been caught staying out all night&nbsp;\u2013 but occasionally she can display moments of generosity and caring. (She flew a relative of Blanca's home from Afghanistan one Christmas, and gave a homeless woman a makeover so she could ace a job interview.) Her bragging suggests that she has dated and/or slept with most of the boys in her high school, as well as some of the male teachers. Despite this, Mandy started dating Kyle in Season 2. As of Season 3, she attends a local college and works at the diner where Kristin used to work. It has been intimated that she has [[ADHD]] when she takes some of Boyd's ADD medication and starts doing well on her college tests. Later that same season, she begins an online clothing business, selling her self-designed fashions which she assembles in the basement of her parents' house. Kyle asks her to marry him in Season 5, the 100th episode. She marries Kyle in Season 6, and they lived in the Baxter home until the finale of season 7. Up until she turned 21, a running gag on the show was Mike, Vanessa, and occasionally Kristin snatching glasses of alcohol out of Mandy's hand, usually followed by Mandy making a lame excuse. Ephraim was replaced by Molly McCook prior to the Season 7 revival on FOX due to Ephraim choosing not to return.<ref name=recast /> Since her marriage, Mandy has done everything possible to avoid conceiving a child, but never bothering to tell husband Kyle that she's not ready for parenthood. That changes at the start of season 8, when she confides that she and Kyle are trying for real to conceive. Also in season 8, Mandy gets an opportunity to design a new casual clothing line for Outdoor Man.\n* [[Kaitlyn Dever]] as Eve Baxter, (series regular, seasons 1\u20136; recurring, season 7-present)<ref>{{cite web |title=Last Man Standing EP Laments That 'Unfortunate' Cast Departure |url=https://tvline.com/2018/08/02/molly-ephraim-leaving-last-man-standing-season-7-mandy-recast/ |website=TV Line |publisher=TV Line |accessdate=2 August 2018}}</ref> the youngest daughter: Eve is intelligent and athletic, and generally has the same interests as Mike, including camping, sports, guns, and the military. She also has [[Conservatism in the United States|conservative]] views like Mike. She is Mike's favorite daughter, and excels at her hobbies. She frequently outplays the boys in soccer and makes the boys' football team as their placekicker. She is well aware of being the favorite over her two sisters. Eve also shares her father's sense of humor, and her sarcastic wit is frequently directed at clueless sister Mandy. Eve is an excellent student, whose only weak subject is art, though she did have to change math classes to escape a prejudiced, anti-female teacher. Eve is a member of [[Junior Reserve Officers' Training Corps|Army Junior ROTC]] and works toward gaining admittance to [[United States Military Academy|West Point]]. Her attempt to do so is unsuccessful, which seriously depresses her, so in season six, Eve decides to take a \"personal year\" rather than immediately attend college. She spends some of this time singing and playing guitar for money, but this proves to be unfruitful. She had more success working at Outdoor Man and volunteering for a [[Habitat for Humanity]]-style local charity. During her gap year, Eve applies to the [[United States Air Force Academy|Air Force Academy]] in nearby [[Colorado Springs]] (without telling either parent), and is accepted. Over her mother's objections, Eve chooses to enlist in the Academy. In season seven, Cadet 4th Class Baxter is only a recurring character as she is now enrolled at the Academy. (This was due to Dever's commitments to the [[Netflix]] miniseries ''[[Unbelievable (miniseries)|Unbelievable]]''.) Due to Dever's continued busy schedule, Eve is again a recurring character in Season 8.<ref>{{cite web |title=Last Man Standing's Kaitlyn Dever Poised to Appear in Fewer Season 8 Episodes: 'She Is Just Crazy Busy' |url=https://tvline.com/2019/12/22/last-man-standing-season-8-eve-baxter-less-episodes-kaitlyn-dever/ |website=TV Line |last=Schwartz |first=Ryan |date=2019-12-22 |accessdate=2020-04-22}}</ref>\n* [[Christoph Sanders]] as Kyle Anderson, a young employee at Outdoor Man: Kyle is universally recognized as a [[Nice guy|good guy]]. Kyle idolizes Mike, having grown up without a father figure, but Mike is mostly irritated by Kyle's personality and behavior. Kyle takes care of his grandmother who has [[dementia]], and it is implied he grew up in her home. His estranged mother passes away in season six, leaving Kyle with mixed feelings over how to deal with it. Kyle is often oblivious to social cues and is slow to catch on to the events happening around him. Kyle dated Kristin in season one and started dating Mandy in season two before proposing in season five, and marrying Mandy in season six. Kyle was shuffled from role to role at Outdoor Man, sometimes messing up due to his trusting nature. In season seven, Mike and Ed experiment with putting him in an HR role, and find that Kyle's combination of people skills and strict adherence to company guidelines makes him a good fit for the position. As of season seven, he has yet to level his mother's trailer or break ground on building his own home, although he and Mandy moved into an apartment at the end of that season. Kyle has mentioned that he and Mandy are trying to conceive a baby, unaware that Mandy has reservations about it and has yet to discontinue birth control. That changes at the start of season 8, when Mandy confides that she and Kyle are trying for real to conceive.\n* [[H\u00e9ctor Elizondo]] as Edward \"Ed\" Alzate, Mike's longtime business partner: Ed started a [[Fish bait|bait]] and [[Fishing tackle|tackle]] shop many years ago and hired Mike, who helped turn the shop into the 20-store Outdoor Man chain.<ref>{{cite episode|title=Rediscover America|series=Last Man Standing|credits=Vince Calandra (writer) & [[Victor Gonzalez (director)|Victor Gonzalez]] (director)|network=[[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]]|airdate=October 10, 2014|season=4|number=3}}</ref> Ed is perhaps fifteen years older than Mike, but the two men bond over similar outdoor hobbies and shared conservative values. He is of [[Basque people|Basque]] heritage, something which he takes great pride in and brings up whenever possible. Mike regularly talks to Ed about the happenings in his home and occasionally seeks advice. Having been divorced four times, Ed's suggestions on relationships are rarely helpful. Despite his status as Outdoor Man \"founder\", Ed has very little business sense (often following fly-by-night promotional trends) and sometimes lacks tact with female customers and employees. Thus, Outdoor Man's success is mainly due to Mike's intelligence and ability to resolve conflicts (sometimes requiring him to pull Ed's foot out of his mouth). He also has five daughters (and a war baby). Ed is a [[Vietnam veteran]], although he saw no combat in Vietnam, stating that he was a clerk in Saigon. He continues to help fellow veterans at the local [[Veterans of Foreign Wars]] hall with their [[United States Department of Veterans Affairs|Veteran Affairs]] paperwork. Ed is also a recurring target for jokes about his age and lack of hair, most often from Mike. Early in Season 7, Ed announces his retirement from Outdoor Man, but still comes in when activities with people his own age bore him, which is often. Also in Season 7, he meets, falls for, and becomes engaged to Vanessa's mother, Bonnie, whom he marries early in Season 8.\n* Flynn Morrison (regular, seasons 2\u20136), [[Jet Jurgensmeyer]] (season 7)<ref name=recast /> (recurring, season 8) and Evan and Luke Kruntchev (recurring, season 1) as Boyd Baxter, son of Kristin and Ryan: Mike enjoys spending quality time with his grandson Boyd, and affectionately views him as the son he never had. Mike and Ryan often clash on how he should be raised. Boyd enjoys activities encouraged by both his father and grandfather.\n* [[Jordan Masterson]] (regular, seasons 4\u2013present; recurring, seasons 2\u20133) and [[Nick Jonas]] (guest star, season 1) as Ryan Vogelson, Boyd's Canadian father: Though Ryan initially fled the country when Kristin fell pregnant, he returned five years later to be involved in Boyd's upbringing (though for next three years he was the personification of a 'deadbeat dad'), and eventually the two reconciled and got engaged (at the end of season 3). Ryan holds liberal views, both politically and philosophically, and he and Mike routinely clash over their fundamentally opposing values, especially when it comes to child-rearing. Ryan wishes to raise his son without religion, hunting culture and national pride, however, neither Mike nor Kristin agree with this approach. His vegan diet, views on discipline, love for all liberal policies, and what Mike sees as his oversensitivity are an affront to Mike's beliefs, but Ryan generally enjoys being a thorn in Mike's side, as well as infuriating the entire family when he mocks their belief in God. Ryan also infuriates the entire family by trying to force his will on Boyd's elementary school, trying to ban things like dodgeball, soda, and worst of all, [[The Pledge of Allegiance]]. On rare occasions, Ryan and Mike agree on what is best for Boyd, but this usually puts them at odds with Kristin or Vanessa. Mike comes to reluctantly respect and like his son-in-law for standing up for what he believes, and for being a loving husband and father. At the beginning of Season 7, Ryan threatens to run back to Canada with Kristin and Boyd over his hatred of President Trump's leadership, until Mike encourages him to apply for U.S. citizenship. (This suggests that for all the time Ryan has been in Boyd's life, he's been an illegal alien). Upon Bud Baxter's passing, Ryan assumes ownership and operation of the marijuana store, with Mike's blessing. He later rents the upper floor of the marijuana store to Mandy and Kyle as an apartment, becoming their landlord.\n* [[Jonathan Adams (American actor)|Jonathan Adams]] as Chuck Larabee (regular, seasons 4\u2013present; recurring, seasons 2\u20133), Mike and Vanessa's neighbor: Chuck is a retired [[Marine (military)|U.S. Marine]] and a veteran of the first [[Gulf War]] who runs a private security business and later takes charge of security for the Denver Outdoor Man. Chuck is an African-American who grew up in [[Minneapolis]], and often jokes with Mike about racial stereotypes. The two regularly exchange barbs as if they don't like each other. In reality, they are good friends, despite being unwilling to admit it. Vanessa sees through their heated exchanges, often telling them to \"get a room\". Chuck's typical response to something or someone that exasperates him is, \"not cool\". Like Mike, Chuck enjoys repairing and restoring cars, something he learned by assisting his father for many years. Chuck is married to Carol and they have a son, Brandon, who is the same age as Eve.\n* [[Krista Marie Yu]] as Jen (season 7\u2013present), Vanessa's foreign-exchange student from Hong Kong who moves in with the Baxters in season 7.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://deadline.com/2019/01/last-man-standing-krista-yu-promoted-series-regular-fox-tim-allen-1202537375/|title='Last Man Standing': Krista Marie Yu Promoted To Regular On Fox Series|publisher=Deadline|author=Denise Petski|date=January 18, 2019|accessdate=February 4, 2019}}</ref> At first, she is shy and goes along with everything Mike wants, but Mike challenges her to be confident and to stand up for her what she wants. As opposed to the Baxter girls, Jen is very passive-aggressive, often giving backhanded compliments or subtly dropping slams against what she perceives as the foolishness of Vanessa and her daughters (mainly Mandy). As of Season 8, Jen is a high school senior and begins kissing up to Vanessa at every opportunity. It's later revealed that Jen is interested in geology, like Vanessa, and has applied to attend the Rocky Mountain Geological Institute.\n\n==Recurring cast==\n* [[Robert Forster]] as Bud Baxter (seasons 1, 3\u20134, 7), Mike's widower father who is initially in the construction business, but later opens a marijuana store (\"Bud's Buds\") after it becomes legal in Colorado. In season 7, it is revealed that Bud died of a heart attack(Forster would succumb to brain cancer a year later, so it's possible that he left the show seeking treatment for this). Ryan, lacking a job after he stopped home-schooling Boyd, takes over the pot shop.\n* [[Christina Moore]] as April (seasons 1 & 3), Vanessa's air-headed and immature younger sister. She is always asking for money, and once wanted to have a child despite having no means of supporting it.\n* [[Danielle Bisutti]] as Michelle (season 1), Vanessa's pseudo-friend and next-door neighbor; she is a local weathergirl who acquires most of her data from a free phone app.\n* [[Erika Alexander]] (seasons 2\u20136) and [[Tisha Campbell-Martin|Tisha Campbell]] (season 7\u2013) as Carol Larabee, Chuck's wife and Mike and Vanessa's neighbor, who becomes Vanessa's best friend. Vanessa often goes overboard trying to act racially open-minded around her, but usually ends up with her foot in her mouth, annoying Carol. In season 6, Carol accepts a year-long job in California, leaving Chuck behind in Denver. She returns in season 7, and the two renew their wedding vows.\n* [[Carla Jimenez]] as Blanca Alvarez (seasons 2\u20134), the Baxters' Guatemalan-born housekeeper who also helps Mandy with her fashion business. The Baxters were happy to celebrate with Blanca after she was sworn in as an American citizen. Her disappearance has never been explained.\n* [[Sarah Gilman]] as Cammy Harris (seasons 2\u20136), Eve's soccer teammate and extremely chatty best friend. It is hinted by Mandy in season 4's \"Restaurant Opening\" that Cammy has a full-on crush for Eve that goes beyond friendship. This leads to Eve avoiding Cammy for a while, though Cammy later insists she would never do anything to make Eve uncomfortable. Cammy also briefly led a three-piece band (with Eve on guitar) called the \"Cammy Harris Experience\". When Cammy and drummer Nigel chickened out at their first gig, Eve performed a solo song that impressed both Mike and the club owner.\n* [[Jonathan Taylor Thomas]] as John Baker (seasons 2\u20133), Kristin's boss at a fancy restaurant where she works. Thomas also had a cameo as \"Randy\" (a nod to his ''[[Home Improvement (TV series)|Home Improvement]]'' character) in the season 4 episode \"Helen Potts\", with fellow ''Home Improvement'' co-star [[Patricia Richardson]]. Since the writing out of John Baker, Jonathan Taylor Thomas has directed multiple episodes of the series.\n* [[Tye Sheridan]] as Justin (seasons 3\u20134), Eve's fellow Jr. ROTC member and football teammate who becomes her boyfriend. The two break up in season 4.\n* [[Zachary Gordon]] as Andrew (season 3), Eve's nerdy classmate who worships her and desperately wants to be her boyfriend. He became her prom date when Justin pushed her too far.\n* [[Joely Fisher]] as Wendi Gracin (seasons 3\u20135), Ed's obnoxious younger girlfriend, whom he meets near the end of season three. Ed routinely has to put her in her place, particularly when she shows up at the store and tries to get involved in running his business (her agenda usually involves denigrating Mike). Wendi deserts Ed offscreen between Seasons 4 and 5, but the two patch things up and reunite. When the series returned for a seventh season, Wendi was not seen or mentioned. It is understood that she and Ed broke up, as Ed dates and later becomes engaged to Vanessa's mother, Bonnie, during that season.\n* [[Bill Engvall]] as Reverend Paul (seasons 5\u2013present), the new pastor of the Baxter family's church, who enjoys hustling donations out of Mike. (Nancy Travis played Bill's wife Susan on three seasons of ''[[The Bill Engvall Show]]'')\n* [[Jay Leno]] as Joe Leonard (seasons 5\u2013present), a semi-retired auto technician from whom Vanessa buys a classic car for Mike. Joe later works in the repair shop at Outdoor Man, servicing products like ATVs, snowmobiles and boat engines. Joe enjoys throwing humorous insults at Mike, often teaming up with Chuck in these exchanges. He is depicted as lonely, living with several cats, and is very close to his mother.\n* [[Travis Tope]] as Rob (season 6), Eve's boyfriend who is studying criminal justice at [[UC Boulder]]. He's a recovering alcoholic, which worries Mike and Vanessa when they first meet him. Shortly before Eve left for the Air Force Academy, Vanessa's nosy meddling ruined their relationship.\n\n==Notable guest stars==\nSeveral notable guest stars have appeared throughout the series, including appearances made from cast members of Tim Allen's previous series, ''[[Home Improvement (TV series)|Home Improvement]]''.\n\n* [[Paul F.

Approximately 220,000 members were purged or left the party. The Bolsheviks stated as justification the need to get rid of the members who had joined the party simply to be on the winning side. The major criteria were [[Social class|social origins]] (members of [[working class]]es were normally accepted without question) and contributions to the revolutionary cause.\n\nThe first Party purge of the [[Joseph Stalin]] era took place in 1929&ndash;1930 in accordance with a resolution of the [[16th Congress of the All-Union Communist Party (Bolsheviks)|XVI Party Conference]].<ref>Gregor, Richard, editor.
