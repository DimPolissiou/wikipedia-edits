When a movement is repeated over time, a long-term muscle memory is created for that task, eventually allowing it to be performed with little to no conscious effort. This process decreases the need for attention and creates maximum efficiency within the motor and memory systems. Examples of muscle memory are found in many everyday activities that become automatic and improve with practice, such as riding a bicycle, [[touch typing|typing on a keyboard]], entering a [[Personal identification number|PIN]], playing a musical instrument,<ref name = \"Krakauer\">{{cite journal | last1 = Krakauer | first1 = J.W. | last2 = Shadmehr | first2 = R. | year = 2006 | title = Consolidation of motor memory | url = | journal = Trends in Neurosciences | volume = 29 | issue = 1| pages = 58\u201364 | doi=10.1016/j.tins.2005.10.003| pmid = 16290273 | pmc = 2553888 }}</ref> [[poker]],<ref>[https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=PGScALPm_xAC&pg=PT97&lpg=PT97&dq=muscle+memory+poker&source=bl&ots=oLO_dB9MhD&sig=jaM74OcKHPofUu-BGHYrR5fISFg&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjyjPvyzdnXAhWka5oKHaE3D6AQ6AEIXjAL#v=onepage&q=muscle%20memory%20poker&f=false Poker Face: How to win poker at the table and online - Judi James.]</ref> martial arts or even dancing.\n\n== History ==\n\nThe origins of research for the acquisition of motor skills stem from philosophers such as [[Plato]], [[Aristotle]] and [[Galen]].

Most motor skills are thought to be acquired through practice; however, mere observation of the skill has led to learning as well.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Celnik | first1 = P. | last2 = Classen | first2 = J. | last3 = Cohen | first3 = G.L. | last4 = Duque | first4 = J. | last5 = Mazzocchio | first5 = R. | last6 = Sawaki | first6 = L. | last7 = Stephan | first7 = K. | last8 = Ungerleider | first8 = L. | year = 2005 | title = Formation of a Motor Memory by Action Observation | url = | journal = The Journal of Neuroscience | volume = 25 | issue = 41| pages = 9339\u20139346 | doi=10.1523/jneurosci.2282-05.2005| pmid = 16221842 | pmc = 6725701 }}</ref> Research suggests we do not start off with a blank slate with regard to motor memory although we do learn most of our motor memory repertoire during our lifetime.<ref name = \"Flanagan\">{{cite journal | last1 = Flanagan | first1 = R.J. | last2 = Ghahramani | first2 = Z. | last3 = Wolpert | first3 = M.D. | year = 2001 | title = Perspectives and Problems in Motor Learning | url = | journal = Trends in Cognitive Sciences | volume = 5 | issue = 11| pages = 487\u2013494 | doi=10.1016/s1364-6613(00)01773-3| pmid = 11684481 }}</ref> Movements such as facial expressions, which are thought to be learned, can actually be observed in children who are blind; thus there is some evidence for motor memory being genetically pre-wired.<ref name = \"Flanagan\" />\n\nIn the early stages of empirical research of motor memory [[Edward Thorndike]], a leading pioneer in the study of motor memory, was among the first to acknowledge learning can occur without conscious awareness.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Shanks | first1 = D.R. | last2 = St | last3 = John | first3 = M.F. | year = 1994 | title = Characteristics of Dissociable Human Learning Systems | url = http://discovery.ucl.ac.uk/142639/1/download2.pdf| journal = Behavioral and Brain Sciences | volume = 17 | issue = 3| pages = 367\u2013447 | doi=10.1017/s0140525x00035032}}</ref> One of the earliest and most notable studies regarding the retention of motor skills was by Hill, Rejall, and Thorndike, who showed savings in relearning typing skills after a 25-year period with no practice.<ref name = \"Lee\" /> Findings related to the retention of learned motor skills have been continuously replicated in studies, suggesting that through subsequent practice, motor learning is stored in the brain as memory.

Brain areas active during motor learning include the motor and somatosensory cortices; however, these areas of activation decrease once the motor skill is learned. The prefrontal and frontal cortices are also active during this stage due to the need for increased attention on the task being learned.<ref name = \"Shadmehr\" />\n\nThe main area involved in motor learning is the [[cerebellum]]. Some models of cerebellar-dependent motor learning, in particular the Marr-Albus model, propose a single plasticity mechanism involving the cerebellar [[long-term depression]] (LTD) of the parallel fiber synapses onto [[Purkinje cells]].  These modifications in synapse activity would mediate motor input with motor outputs critical to inducing motor learning.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Boyden | first1 = E. | last2 = Katoh | first2 = A. | last3 = Raymond | first3 = J. | year = 2004 | title = Cerebellum-dependent learning: the role of multiple plasticity mechanisms | url = | journal = Annu.

Regardless of the mechanism, studies of cerebellar-dependent  motor tasks show that cerebral cortical plasticity is crucial for motor learning, even if not necessarily for storage.<ref name = \"Ma\" />\n\nThe [[basal ganglia]] also play an important role in memory and learning, in particular in reference to stimulus-response associations and the formation of habits. The basal ganglia-cerebellar connections are thought to increase with time when learning a motor task.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Packard | first1 = M. | last2 = Knowlton | first2 = B. | year = 2002 | title = Learning and memory functions of the basal ganglia.  | url = | journal = Annu.

The exact mechanism of motor memory consolidation within the brain is controversial. However, most theories assume that there is a general redistribution of information across the brain from encoding to consolidation.  [[Hebb's rule]] states that \"synaptic connectivity changes as a function of repetitive firing.\" In this case, that would mean that the high amount of stimulation coming from practicing a movement would cause the repetition of firing in certain motor networks, presumably leading to an increase in the efficiency of exciting these motor networks over time.<ref name= \"Ma\">{{cite journal | last1 = Ma | first1 = L. | display-authors = etal   | year = 2010| title = ,.

These studies have shown a weakened connection from the cerebellum to the primary motor area with practice, it is presumed, because of a decreased need for error correction from the cerebellum. However, the connection between the basal ganglia and the primary motor area is strengthened, suggesting the basal ganglia play an important role in the motor memory consolidation process.<ref name = \"Ma\" />\n\n===Strength training and adaptations===\n{{See also|Muscle memory (strength training)}}\nWhen participating in any sport, new motor skills and movement combinations are frequently being used and repeated. All sports require some degree of strength, endurance training, and skilled reaching in order to be successful in the required tasks. Muscle memory related to [[Muscle memory (strength training)|strength training]]  involves elements of both motor learning, described below, and long-lasting changes in the muscle tissue.\n\nEvidence has shown that increases in strength occur well before muscle [[hypertrophy]], and decreases in strength due to detraining or ceasing to repeat the exercise over an extended period of time precede muscle [[atrophy]].<ref name = \"Adkins\">{{cite journal | last1 = Adkins | first1 = DeAnna L. | last2 = Boychuck | first2 = Jeffery | year = 2006 | title = Motor training induces experience specific patterns of plasticity across motor cortex and spinal cord | url = https://semanticscholar.org/paper/3d63cc947cfcc449d69c520ee3b6099c9d4bc243| journal = Journal of Applied Physiology | volume = 101 | issue = 6| pages = 1776\u20131782 | doi=10.1152/japplphysiol.00515.2006 | pmid=16959909}}</ref> To be specific, strength training enhances [[motor neuron]] excitability and induces [[synaptogenesis]], both of which would help in enhancing communication between the nervous system and the muscles themselves.<ref name = \"Adkins\" /> [[File:US Navy 071017-N-0995C-008 Chief Mineman Kevin Sperling, an officer recruiter at Navy Recruiting Processing Station Honolulu, presses two 105-pound dumbbells.jpg|thumb|right|alt=A navy man performs strength training exercises.]]However, neuromuscular efficacy is not altered within a two-week time period following cessation of the muscle usage; instead, it is merely the [[neuron]]'s ability to excite the muscle that declines in correlation with the muscle's decrease in strength.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Deschenes Michael | first1 = R. | last2 = Giles Jennifer | first2 = A. | year = 2002 | title = Neural factors account for strength decrements observed after short-term muscle unloading | url = | journal = American Journal of Physiology.

The researchers went on to examine the human epigenome in order to understand how DNA methylation may aid in creating this effect. During the first period of resistance exercise, the authors identify significant adaptations in the human methylome, whereby over 9,000 CpG sites were reported as being significantly hypomethylated, with these adaptations being sustained during the subsequent period of physical in-activity. However, upon secondary exposure to resistance exercise, a greater frequency of hypomethylated CpG sites was observed, where over 18,000 sites reported as being significantly hypomethylated. The authors went on to identify how these changes altered the expression of relevant transcripts, and subsequently correlated these changes with adaptations in skeletal muscle mass. Collectively, the authors conclude that skeletal muscle mass and muscle memory phenomenon is, at least in part, modulated due to changes in DNA methylation.<ref name = \"seaborne\" /> Further work is now needed to confirm and explore these findings.\n\n==Fine motor memory==\n\n[[Fine motor skills]] are often discussed in terms of transitive movements, which are those done when using tools (which could be as simple as a tooth brush or pencil).<ref name = \"Dowell\">{{cite journal | last1 = Dowell | first1 = L.

Also, it was found that gross motor memory in Alzheimer's patients was the same as that of healthy adults when learning occurs under constant practice.<ref name=\"Dick\" /> This suggests that damage to the hippocampal system does not impair an Alzheimer's patient from retaining new gross motor skills, implying that motor memory for gross motor skills is stored elsewhere in the brain. However there isn't much evidence provided on this.\n\n== Impairment ==\nIt is difficult to display cases of \"pure\" motor memory impairment because the memory system is so widespread throughout the brain that damage is not often isolated to one specific type of memory.  Likewise,  diseases commonly associated with motor deficits, such as [[Huntington's]] and [[Parkinson's disease]], have a wide variety of symptoms and associated brain damage that make it impossible to pinpoint whether or not motor memory is in fact impaired.  Case studies have provided some examples of how motor memory has been implemented in patients with brain damage.\n\nAs Edward S. Casey notes in Remembering, Second Edition: A Phenomenological Study,  declarative memory, a process that involves an initial fragile learning period. \"The activity of the past, in short, resides in its habitual enactment in the present.\"\n\n=== Consolidation deficit ===\nA recent issue in motor memory is whether or not it consolidates in a manner similar to declarative memory, a process that involves an initial fragile learning period that eventually becomes stable and less susceptible to damage over time.<ref name = \"Krakauer\" /> An example of stable motor memory consolidation in a patient with brain damage is the case of [[Clive Wearing]]. Clive has severe anterograde and retrograde amnesia owing to damage in his temporal lobes, frontal lobes, and hippocampi, which prevents him from storing any new memories and making him aware of only the present moment. However, Clive still retains access to his procedural memories, to be specific, the motor memories involved in playing the piano. This could be because motor memory is demonstrated through savings over several trials of learning, whereas declarative memory is demonstrated through recall of a single item.<ref name = \"Krakauer\" />  This suggests that lesions in certain brain areas normally associated with declarative memory would not affect motor memory for a well-learned skill.\n\n=== Dysgraphia for the alphabet ===\nCase study: 54-year-old woman with known history of [[epilepsy]]\n\t\nThis patient was diagnosed with a pure form of [[dysgraphia]] of letters, meaning he had no other speech or reading impairments.<ref name=\"Kapur\">{{cite journal |last=Kapur |first=N. |last2=Lawton |first2=N.

Brain areas active during motor learning include the motor and somatosensory cortices; however, these areas of activation decrease once the motor skill is learned. The prefrontal and frontal cortices are also active during this stage due to the need for increased attention on the task being learned.<ref name = \"Shadmehr\" />\n\nThe main area involved in motor learning is the [[cerebellum]]. Some models of cerebellar-dependent motor learning, in particular the Marr-Albus model, propose a single plasticity mechanism involving the cerebellar [[long-term depression]] (LTD) of the parallel fiber synapses onto [[Purkinje cells]].  These modifications in synapse activity would mediate motor input with motor outputs critical to inducing motor learning.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Boyden | first1 = E. | last2 = Katoh | first2 = A. | last3 = Raymond | first3 = J. | year = 2004 | title = Cerebellum-dependent learning: the role of multiple plasticity mechanisms | url = | journal = Annu.

The exact mechanism of motor memory consolidation within the brain is controversial. However, most theories assume that there is a general redistribution of information across the brain from encoding to consolidation.  [[Hebb's rule]] states that \"synaptic connectivity changes as a function of repetitive firing.\" In this case, that would mean that the high amount of stimulation coming from practicing a movement would cause the repetition of firing in certain motor networks, presumably leading to an increase in the efficiency of exciting these motor networks over time.<ref name= \"Ma\">{{cite journal | last1 = Ma | first1 = L. | display-authors = etal   | year = 2010| title = ,.

These studies have shown a weakened connection from the cerebellum to the primary motor area with practice, it is presumed, because of a decreased need for error correction from the cerebellum. However, the connection between the basal ganglia and the primary motor area is strengthened, suggesting the basal ganglia play an important role in the motor memory consolidation process.<ref name = \"Ma\" />\n\n===Strength training and adaptations===\n{{See also|Muscle memory (strength training)}}\nWhen participating in any sport, new motor skills and movement combinations are frequently being used and repeated.

The researchers went on to examine the human epigenome in order to understand how DNA methylation may aid in creating this effect. During the first period of resistance exercise, the authors identify significant adaptations in the human methylome, whereby over 9,000 CpG sites were reported as being significantly hypomethylated, with these adaptations being sustained during the subsequent period of physical in-activity. However, upon secondary exposure to resistance exercise, a greater frequency of hypomethylated CpG sites was observed, where over 18,000 sites reported as being significantly hypomethylated. The authors went on to identify how these changes altered the expression of relevant transcripts, and subsequently correlated these changes with adaptations in skeletal muscle mass. Collectively, the authors conclude that skeletal muscle mass and muscle memory phenomenon is, at least in part, modulated due to changes in DNA methylation.<ref name = \"seaborne\" /> Further work is now needed to confirm and explore these findings.\n\n==Fine motor memory==\n\n[[Fine motor skills]] are often discussed in terms of transitive movements, which are those done when using tools (which could be as simple as a tooth brush or pencil).<ref name = \"Dowell\">{{cite journal | last1 = Dowell | first1 = L.

A simple repetition of algorithms will create a long-term knowledge of it.

In a study with preschoolers, looking at the role of self-instruction on acquiring complex gross motor chains using [[ballet]] positions, it was found that the motor skills were better learned and remembered with the self-instruction procedure over the no-self-instruction procedure.<ref name=\"Vintere\">{{cite journal |last=Vintere |first=P. |last2=Hemmes |first2=N.

Also, it was found that gross motor memory in Alzheimer's patients was the same as that of healthy adults when learning occurs under constant practice.<ref name=\"Dick\" /> This suggests that damage to the hippocampal system does not impair an Alzheimer's patient from retaining new gross motor skills, implying that motor memory for gross motor skills is stored elsewhere in the brain. However there isn't much evidence provided on this.\n\n== Impairment ==\nIt is difficult to display cases of \"pure\" motor memory impairment because the memory system is so widespread throughout the brain that damage is not often isolated to one specific type of memory.  Likewise,  diseases commonly associated with motor deficits, such as [[Huntington's]] and [[Parkinson's disease]], have a wide variety of symptoms and associated brain damage that make it impossible to pinpoint whether or not motor memory is in fact impaired.  Case studies have provided some examples of how motor memory has been implemented in patients with brain damage.\n\nAs Edward S. Casey notes in Remembering, Second Edition: A Phenomenological Study,  declarative memory, a process that involves an initial fragile learning period. \"The activity of the past, in short, resides in its habitual enactment in the present.\"\n\n=== Consolidation deficit ===\nA recent issue in motor memory is whether or not it consolidates in a manner similar to declarative memory, a process that involves an initial fragile learning period that eventually becomes stable and less susceptible to damage over time.<ref name = \"Krakauer\" /> An example of stable motor memory consolidation in a patient with brain damage is the case of [[Clive Wearing]]. Clive has severe anterograde and retrograde amnesia owing to damage in his temporal lobes, frontal lobes, and hippocampi, which prevents him from storing any new memories and making him aware of only the present moment. However, Clive still retains access to his procedural memories, to be specific, the motor memories involved in playing the piano. This could be because motor memory is demonstrated through savings over several trials of learning, whereas declarative memory is demonstrated through recall of a single item.<ref name = \"Krakauer\" />  This suggests that lesions in certain brain areas normally associated with declarative memory would not affect motor memory for a well-learned skill.\n\n=== Dysgraphia for the alphabet ===\nCase study: 54-year-old woman with known history of [[epilepsy]]\n\t\nThis patient was diagnosed with a pure form of [[dysgraphia]] of letters, meaning he had no other speech or reading impairments.<ref name=\"Kapur\">{{cite journal |last=Kapur |first=N. |last2=Lawton |first2=N.

On 23 April 1945, while towing targets for U.S. Navy bomber exercises off the coast of [[Maine]], ''Eagle 56'' was sunk by the {{GS|U-853}}. Only 13 of the 62 crew survived. The loss was classified as a [[boiler]] explosion until 2001, because the navy brass didn't want to admit that they screwed up, so they decided to initiate the officer protection society (OPS).  They covered up the real cause even though every survivor testified under oath that they witnessed torpedoes and saw the U-Boat.  But the navy didn't want their college buddies to be embarrassed so they wrote up a bull shit story and blamed the crew.  This screwed the crew members of PE-56 because those guys were war heroes that deserved purple hearts.  Finally the navy was forced to change their bull shit story when they were presented with overwhelming evidence.  In 2018 historical evidence convinced the US Navy to reclassify the sinking as a combat loss due to enemy action; yet another government coverup discovered and righted by Americans who did the right thing.\n\n==Service history==\n''Eagle 56'' was one of 60 {{sclass2-|Eagle|patrol craft}} built by [[Henry Ford]] late in World War I as [[submarine chaser]]s, none of which saw action.

After Maximilian I's death in 1519, Hubmaier helped orchestrate a violent pogrom against Regensburg's Jews, as well as the total destruction of their synagogue; after the Jews' murder and expulsion, he was instrumental in orchestrating\u2014near the site of the erstwhile synagogue\u2014an image cult of the Beautiful Maria of Regensburg which drew pilgrims from all over Europe and was much criticized by Reformers.  In 1521 Hubmaier went to [[Waldshut-Tiengen|Waldshut]].

In March 1523, in [[Z\u00fcrich]], H\u00fcbmaier met with [[Huldrych Zwingli]], and even participated in a disputation there in October of that same year. In the disputation, he set forth the principle of obedience to the Scriptures, writing, \u201cIn all disputes concerning faith and religion, the scriptures alone, proceeding from the mouth of God, ought to be our level and rule.\u201d<ref name='Vedder'/>{{Rp|59}} It was evidently here that H\u00fcbmaier committed to abandoning [[infant baptism]], a practice he could not support with Scripture. He held that even where the Scriptures appear to contain contradictions, both truths are to be held simultaneously. \n\nAnabaptist [[Wilhelm Reublin]] arrived in Waldshut in 1525, having been driven out of Z\u00fcrich. In April Reublin baptized Hubmaier and sixty others. In Waldshut, Hubmaier's increasingly Anabaptist views gained him the disfavor of Prince [[Ferdinand I, Holy Roman Emperor|Ferdinand]].<ref name='Vedder'/>{{Rp|76}} It was that rivalry that would eventually lead to Hubmaier's martyrdom. Hubmaier initially went to Schaffhausen in order to find protection against the Prince.<ref name='Vedder'/>{{Rp|81-83}}\n\nIn December 1525, Hubmaier again fled to Z\u00fcrich to escape the Austrian army. Hoping to find refuge, Zwingli instead had him arrested. While a prisoner, Hubmaier requested a disputation on baptism, which was granted. The disputation yielded some unusual events. Ten men, four of whom Hubmaier requested, were present for the disputation. Within the discussion, Hubmaier proceeded to quote statements by Zwingli in which he asserted that children should not be baptized until they had been instructed. Zwingli responded that he had been misunderstood. Hubmaier's criticism went further by placing Zwingli's reversal on the issue against Zwingli's reform against the Catholics. Hubmaier wrote, \u201cIf you do not [demonstrate infant baptism from Scripture], the vicar will complain that you have used against him a sword that you now lay aside.\u201d<ref name='Vedder'/>{{Rp|119n}}\n\nDespite Hubmaier's arguments, the council sided with the native Zwingli and ruled in Zwingli's favor. The bewildered H\u00fcbmaier agreed to recant. But before the congregation the next day, he attested the mental and spiritual anguish brought on by his actions and stated \"I cannot and I will not recant.\" Back in prison and under the torture of the rack, he did offer the required recantation.<ref name='Vedder'/>{{Rp|138\u2013140}} He was then allowed to leave [[Switzerland]] and journeyed to [[Mikulov|Nikolsburg]] in [[Moravia]]. This weakness troubled him deeply and brought forth his ''Short Apology'' in 1526, which includes the statements: \"I may err\u2014-I am a man\u2014-but a heretic I cannot be... O God, pardon me my weakness\".\n\n== Prison and death==\nIn Nikolsburg, Hubmaier's preaching soon made converts to Anabaptism out of the group of Zwinglians who lived in the area.<ref name='qualben'/>{{Rp|330}} Political fortunes turned, however, and Ferdinand, to whom Hubmaier had already become an enemy while in Waldshut, gained control of Bohemia, thus placing Hubmaier once again in Ferdinand's jurisdiction. Hubmaier and his wife were seized by the Austrian authorities and taken to [[Vienna]]. He was held in the castle Gratzenstein (now called \"[[Burg Kreuzenstein]]\" in German), until March 1528.\n\n\"I may err -- I am a man,\" he wrote, \"but a heretic I cannot be, because I ask constantly for instruction in the word of God.\" (Estep, p192) He suffered torture on the rack, and was tried for heresy and convicted. On 10 March 1528, he was taken to the public square and executed by burning. His wife exhorted him to remain steadfast.  A monument to \"Dr. Balthasar Hubmaier\" was erected on Dr.-Karl-Lueger-Platz in Vienna.{{Citation needed|date=March 2020}}                        \n\nThree days after his execution, his wife, with a stone tied around her neck, was drowned in the River [[Danube]].  \n\n== Views ==\n{{Anabaptist vertical}}\n===On the Trinity===\nHubmaier was more conservative than some Anabaptists, such as [[Hans Denck]] and [[Leonhard Schiemer]] who went on to deny the doctrine of the Trinity, or avoided emphasis of the doctrine as [[Menno Simons]].<ref>Eddie Louis Mabry ''Balthasar Hubmaier's understanding of faith'' p137</ref> He was aided in regaining the support of the Nikolsburg preachers against [[Hans Hut]] by the latter's assertion that Christ was only a \"great prophet\".\n===On Government and the Sword===\nAs a ''Schwertler'' (of-the-sword) Anabaptist, Hubmaier believed government to be an institution ordained by God. According to the view represented in his writings, Christians have a responsibility to support government and pay taxes. While Hubmaier may be considered a moderate [[Christian pacifism|pacifist]], he clearly stated his beliefs regarding the government's responsibility to defend the righteous, the innocent, and the helpless, in his work, ''On the Sword''. Moreover, he believed that Christians, if ordered to take up the sword for just cause by the ruling government, should indeed do so. This is the primary distinction between ''Schwertler'' Anabaptism and the total pacifism of ''St\u00e4bler'' (staff/cane-bearing) Anabaptism.\n\n===On Baptism===\nMuch of Hubmaier's work centered on the issue of baptism because of the polemical nature of the issue in distinguishing the emerging Anabaptist movement from Zwinglian or other magisterial reform movements. Hubmaier rejected the notion of infant baptism as unscriptural and was a proponent of believer's baptism, i.e. that baptism is an ordinance for those who respond to the gospel. The importance of this point in Hubmaier's theology is demonstrated by the fact that the first half of his catechism is reserved for clarification of the issue. He further rejected the Catholic doctrine of baptism insofar as it was ''ex opere operato'' and viewed the rite as a symbol of entrance into and accountability to the community of faith. It is not entirely clear what mode of baptism Hubmaier practiced, but it seems as though he continued practicing affusion as he had himself been baptized and that the mode of immersion among Anabaptists was a somewhat later development.\n\n===On Mary===\nDespite his break away from the Catholic Church, Hubmaier never abandoned his belief in the perpetual virginity of Mary and continued to esteem Mary as [[theotokos]] (\"mother of God\"). These two doctrinal stances are addressed individually in Articles Nine and Ten, respectively, of Hubmaier's work, ''Apologia''.<ref>Klager, Andrew. \"Ingestion and Gestation: Peacemaking, the Lord's Supper, and the Theotokos in the Mennonite-Anabaptist and Eastern Orthodox Traditions.\" ''Journal of Ecumenical Studies'' 47, no. 3 (summer 2012): 452.</ref>\n\n===On the Vernacular===\nHaving a university education meant that Hubmaier would have been familiar with Latin, the language in which all official church communication was at that time conducted. Despite his familiarity with the language, he chose to communicate in the vernacular, which for him was German, for the purpose of communicating to the common people who would not have understood Latin. This is evidenced by the fact that his writings were written in German. Further evidence of this comes from this quote of his, \"The death of the Lord should be preached after any land\u2019s tongue\u2026 It is much better that a single verse of the psalms be spoken in every land after the language of the common people than five entire psalms be sung in a foreign language and not be understood in the church.\"\n\n===On Women===\nHubmaier's writings dealt a little with the subject of women. He compared God's discipline of his children with a teacher whipping a student, or a man beating his wife. It is unknown if Hubmaier agreed with the practice of beating one's students or one's wife, for he did not elaborate in his work. As with any figure in earlier times, however, we cannot judge precisely Hubmaier's view on women based on such a reference.<ref>Hubmaier, Balthasar.

After Maximilian I's death in 1519, Hubmaier helped orchestrate a violent pogrom against Regensburg's Jews, as well as the total destruction of their synagogue; after the Jews' murder and expulsion, he was instrumental in orchestrating\u2014near the site of the erstwhile synagogue\u2014an image cult of the Beautiful Maria of Regensburg which drew pilgrims from all over Europe and was much criticized by Reformers.

After the [[Break-up of the Beatles|Beatles disbanded]] in 1970, Lennon continued as a solo artist and as Ono's collaborator.\n\nBorn in [[Liverpool]], Lennon became involved in the [[Skiffle#Revival in the United Kingdom|skiffle craze]] as a teenager. In 1956, he formed his first band, [[the Quarrymen]], which evolved into the Beatles in 1960. He was initially the group's de facto leader, a role gradually ceded to McCartney. Lennon was characterised for the rebellious nature and acerbic wit in his music, writing, drawings, on film and in interviews.  In the mid-1960s, he had two books published: ''[[In His Own Write]]'' and ''[[A Spaniard in the Works]]'', both collections of [[literary nonsense|nonsensical writings]] and line drawings. Starting with 1967's \"[[All You Need Is Love]]\", his songs were adopted as anthems by the [[anti-war movement]] and the larger [[Counterculture of the 1960s|counterculture]].\n\nFrom 1968 to 1972, Lennon produced more than a dozen records with Ono, including a trilogy of [[avant-garde music|avant-garde]] albums, his first solo LP ''[[John Lennon/Plastic Ono Band]]'', and the international top 10 singles <!-- Before adding to this list of Lennon's most significant songs, please seek consensus on the talk page first. Thank you. --> \"[[Give Peace a Chance]]\", \"[[Instant Karma!]]\", \"[[Imagine (John Lennon song)|Imagine]]\" and \"[[Happy Xmas (War Is Over)]]\". Controversial through his political and peace activism, after moving to New York City in 1971, his criticism of the [[Vietnam War]] resulted in a three-year attempt by the [[Presidency of Richard Nixon|Nixon administration]] to deport him. In 1975, Lennon disengaged from the music business to raise his infant son [[Sean Lennon|Sean]], and in 1980, returned with the Ono collaboration ''[[Double Fantasy]]''. He was [[Murder of John Lennon|shot and killed]] in the archway of his [[Manhattan, New York City|Manhattan]] apartment building by a Beatles fan, [[Mark David Chapman]], three weeks after the album's release.\n\nBy 2018, Lennon's solo equivalent album sales had exceeded 72 million units worldwide.<ref name=\"chartmasters.org\">{{cite web |url=https://chartmasters.org/2017/10/best-selling-artists-albums-and-singles-of-all-time/18/ |title=John Lennon's albums and songs sales |date=19 October 2017}}</ref> In 2002, he was voted eighth in a BBC poll of the [[100 Greatest Britons]], and in 2008, ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' ranked him the fifth-greatest singer of all time. In 1987, he was inducted into the [[Songwriters Hall of Fame]].

Alfred was a [[Merchant Navy|merchant seaman]] of [[Irish people|Irish]] descent who was away at the time of his son's birth.{{sfn|Harry|2000b|p=504}} His parents named him John Winston Lennon after his paternal grandfather, John \"Jack\" Lennon, and Prime Minister [[Winston Churchill]].{{sfn|Spitz|2005|p=24: \"Julia offered the name in honour of&nbsp;... Winston Churchill\"}} His father was often away from home but sent regular pay cheques to 9{{nbsp}}Newcastle Road, Liverpool, where Lennon lived with his mother;{{sfn|Spitz|2005|p=24: \"The entire Stanley clan gathered nightly at Newcastle Road\"}} the cheques stopped when he went [[AWOL|absent without leave]] in February 1944.{{sfn|Lennon|2005|p=54: \"Until then he had sent her money each month from his wages, but now it stopped\"}}{{sfn|Spitz|2005|p=26: \"In February 1944&nbsp;... he was arrested and imprisoned. Freddie subsequently disappeared for six months\"}} When he eventually came home six months later, he offered to look after the family, but Julia, by then pregnant with another man's child, rejected the idea.{{sfn|Spitz|2005|p=27}} After her sister [[Mimi Smith|Mimi]] complained to Liverpool's Social Services twice, Julia gave her custody of Lennon. In July 1946, Lennon's father visited her and took his son to [[Blackpool]], secretly intending to emigrate to New Zealand with him.{{sfn|Lennon|2005|p=56: \"Alf admitted to her that he had planned to take John to live in New Zealand\"}} Julia followed them \u2013 with her partner at the time, Bobby Dykins \u2013 and after a heated argument, his father forced the five-year-old to choose between them. In one account of this incident, Lennon twice chose his father, but as his mother walked away, he began to cry and followed her.{{sfn|Spitz|2005|p=30: \"Julia went out of the door&nbsp;... John ran after her\"}} According to author [[Mark Lewisohn]], however, Lennon's parents agreed that Julia should take him and give him a home. A witness who was there that day, Billy Hall, has said that the dramatic portrayal of a young John Lennon being forced to make a decision between his parents is inaccurate.{{sfn|Lewisohn|2013|p=41-42}} Lennon had no further contact with Alf for close to 20 years.{{sfn|Spitz|2005|p=497}}\n\nThroughout the rest of his childhood and adolescence, Lennon lived at [[251 Menlove Avenue|Mendips, 251{{nbsp}}Menlove Avenue]], [[Woolton]], with Mimi and her husband [[George Toogood Smith]], who had no children of their own.{{sfn|Lennon|2005|p=56: \"Hard to see why Mimi wanted John, as she had always said she didn't want children\"}} His aunt purchased volumes of short stories for him, and his uncle, a dairyman at his family's farm, bought him a mouth organ and engaged him in solving {{linktext|crossword}} puzzles.{{sfn|Spitz|2005|p=32: \"When he was old enough, taught John how to solve crossword puzzles\"}} Julia visited Mendips on a regular basis, and when John was 11 years old, he often visited her at 1&nbsp;Blomfield Road, Liverpool, where she played him [[Elvis Presley]] records, taught him the banjo, and showed him how to play \"[[Ain't That a Shame]]\" by [[Fats Domino]].{{sfn|Spitz|2005|p=48: \"To get them started, she applied the triad to 'Ain't That a Shame'\"}} In September 1980, Lennon commented about his family and his rebellious nature:\n\n{{quote|A part of me would like to be accepted by all facets of society and ''not'' be this loudmouthed lunatic poet/musician.

They asked [[Pete Best]] to join them.{{sfn|Miles|1997|p=57}} Lennon's aunt, horrified when he told her about the trip, pleaded with Lennon to continue his art studies instead.{{sfn|Lennon|2005|p=53}} After the first Hamburg residency, the band accepted another in April 1961, and a third in April 1962. As with the other band members, Lennon was introduced to [[Preludin]] while in Hamburg,{{sfn|Miles|1997|pp=66\u201367}} and regularly took the drug as a stimulant during their long, overnight performances.{{sfn|Lennon|2005|p=57}}\n\n[[File:John Lennon (cropped).jpg|left|thumb|upright=0.6|Lennon in 1964]]\n[[Brian Epstein]] managed the Beatles from 1962 until his death in 1967. He had no previous experience managing artists, but he had a strong influence on the group's dress code and attitude on stage.{{sfn|The Beatles|2000|p=67}} Lennon initially resisted his attempts to encourage the band to present a professional appearance, but eventually complied, saying \"I'll wear a bloody balloon if somebody's going to pay me.\"{{sfn|Frankel|2007}} McCartney took over on bass after Sutcliffe decided to stay in Hamburg, and Best was replaced with drummer [[Ringo Starr]]; this completed the four-piece line-up that would remain until the group's break-up in 1970. The band's first single, \"[[Love Me Do]]\", was released in October 1962 and reached No. 17 on the British charts. They recorded their debut album, ''[[Please Please Me]]'', in under 10 hours on 11 February 1963,{{sfn|Harry|2000b|p=721}} a day when Lennon was suffering the effects of a cold,{{sfn|Lewisohn |1988|pp=24\u201326: \"Twist and Shout, which had to be recorded last because John Lennon had a particularly bad cold\"}} which is evident in the vocal on the last song to be recorded that day, \"[[Twist and Shout]]\".{{sfn|Spitz|2005|p=376: \"He had been struggling all day to reach notes, but this was different, this hurt\"}} The Lennon\u2013McCartney songwriting partnership yielded eight of its fourteen tracks. With a few exceptions, one being the album title itself, Lennon had yet to bring his love of wordplay to bear on his song lyrics, saying: \"We were just writing songs{{nbsp}}... pop songs with no more thought of them than that \u2013 to create a sound. And the words were almost irrelevant\".{{sfn|Harry|2000b|p=721}} In a 1987 interview, McCartney said that the other Beatles idolised Lennon: \"He was like our own little Elvis{{nbsp}}...

Lennon was on tour when his first son, [[Julian Lennon|Julian]], was born in April. During their [[Royal Variety Show]] performance, which was attended by the Queen Mother and other British royalty, Lennon poked fun at the audience: \"For our next song, I'd like to ask for your help.

Lennon described the venture as an attempt to achieve \"artistic freedom within a business structure\".{{sfn|Harry|2000b|p=31}} Released amid a period of [[Protests of 1968|civic unrest and protests]], the band's debut single for the Apple label included Lennon's B-side \"[[Revolution (Beatles song)|Revolution]]\", in which he called for a \"plan\" rather than committing to [[Maoist]] revolution. The song's pacifist message led to ridicule from political radicals in the [[New Left]] press.{{sfn|Wiener|1990|p=60}} Adding to the tensions at the Beatles' recording sessions that year, Lennon insisted on having his new girlfriend, the Japanese artist [[Yoko Ono]], beside him, thereby contravening the band's policy regarding wives and girlfriends in the studio. He was especially pleased with his songwriting contributions to the double album and identified it as a superior work to ''Sgt.

Lennon asked [[Lord Beeching]] to take on the role, but he declined, advising Lennon to go back to making records. Lennon was approached by [[Allen Klein]], who had managed [[the Rolling Stones]] and other bands during the [[British Invasion]]. In early 1969, Klein was appointed as Apple's chief executive by Lennon, Harrison and Starr,{{sfn|TelegraphKlein|2010}} but McCartney never signed the management contract.{{sfn|Miles|1997|p=549: \"Paul never did sign the management contract\"}} Lennon and Ono were married on 20 March 1969, and soon released a series of 14 [[lithograph]]s called \"Bag One\" depicting scenes from their honeymoon,{{sfn|Fawcett|1976|p=185}} eight of which were deemed indecent and most of which were banned and confiscated.{{sfn|Coleman|1984a|p=279}} Lennon's creative focus continued to move beyond the Beatles, and between 1968 and 1969 he and Ono recorded three albums of experimental music together: ''[[Unfinished Music No. 1: Two Virgins]]''{{sfn|Coleman|1984a|pp=48\u201349}} (known more for its cover than for its music), ''[[Unfinished Music No. 2: Life with the Lions]]'' and ''[[Wedding Album]]''.

Epstein was homosexual, and according to biographer [[Philip Norman (author)|Philip Norman]], one of Epstein's reasons for wanting to manage the group was that he was attracted to Lennon. Almost as soon as Julian was born, Lennon went on holiday to Spain with Epstein, which led to speculation about their relationship. When he was later questioned about it, Lennon said, \"Well, it was almost a love affair, but not quite. It was never consummated. But it was a pretty intense relationship. It was my first experience with a homosexual that I was conscious was homosexual. We used to sit in a caf\u00e9 in [[Torremolinos]] looking at all the boys and I'd say, 'Do you like that one?

Lennon was touring with the Beatles when Julian was born on 8 April 1963. Julian's birth, like his mother Cynthia's marriage to Lennon, was kept secret because Epstein was convinced that public knowledge of such things would threaten the Beatles' commercial success. Julian recalled that as a small child in [[Weybridge]] some four years later, \"I was trundled home from school and came walking up with one of my watercolour paintings. It was just a bunch of stars and this blonde girl I knew at school. And Dad said, 'What's this?' I said, 'It's Lucy in the sky with diamonds.'\"{{sfn|Harry|2000b|p=517}} Lennon used it as the title of a [[Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds|Beatles song]], and though it was later reported to have been derived from the initials [[Lysergic acid diethylamide|LSD]], Lennon insisted, \"It's not an acid song.\"{{sfn|Harry|2000b|p=574}} Lennon was distant from Julian, who felt closer to McCartney than to his father. During a car journey to visit Cynthia and Julian during Lennon's divorce, McCartney composed a song, \"Hey Jules\", to comfort him. It would evolve into the Beatles song \"[[Hey Jude]]\". Lennon later said, \"That's his best song. It started off as a song about my son Julian{{nbsp}} ... he turned it into 'Hey Jude'.

They were introduced by gallery owner [[John Dunbar (artist)|John Dunbar]].{{sfn|Harry|2000b|p=682}} Lennon was intrigued by Ono's \"Hammer A Nail\": patrons hammered a nail into a wooden board, creating the art piece. Although the exhibition had not yet begun, Lennon wanted to hammer a nail into the clean board, but Ono stopped him. Dunbar asked her, \"Don't you know who this is? He's a millionaire! He might buy it.\" According to Lennon's recollection in 1980, Ono had not heard of the Beatles, but she relented on condition that Lennon pay her five [[wikt:shilling|shillings]], to which Lennon said he replied, \"I'll give you an imaginary five shillings and hammer an imaginary nail in.\"{{sfn|Sheff|2000|p=104}} Ono subsequently related that Lennon had taken a bite out of the apple on display in her work ''[[Apple (artwork)|Apple]]'', much to her fury.<ref name='MOMA'>{{cite web|title=Apple.

They were married in [[Gibraltar]] on 20 March 1969,{{sfn|Coleman|1992|p=705}} and spent their honeymoon at the [[Hilton Amsterdam]], campaigning with a week-long [[Bed-In|Bed-In for Peace]]. They planned another Bed-In in the United States, but were denied entry,{{sfn|Kruse|2009|p=16}} so held one instead at the [[Queen Elizabeth Hotel]] in Montreal, where they recorded \"[[Give Peace a Chance]]\".{{sfn|Harry|2000b|p=276}} They often combined advocacy with performance art, as in their \"[[Bagism]]\", first introduced during a Vienna press conference. Lennon detailed this period in the Beatles song \"[[The Ballad of John and Yoko]]\".{{sfn|Coleman|1992|p=550}} Lennon changed his name by [[deed poll]] on 22 April 1969, adding \"Ono\" as a middle name. The brief ceremony took place on the roof of the [[Apple Corps]] building, where the Beatles had performed [[The Beatles' rooftop concert|their rooftop concert]] three months earlier. Although he used the name John Ono Lennon thereafter, official documents referred to him as John Winston Ono Lennon, since he was not permitted to revoke a name given at birth.{{sfn|Coleman|1984b|p=64}} The couple settled at [[Tittenhurst Park]] at [[Sunninghill, Berkshire|Sunninghill]] in [[Berkshire]].{{sfn|Norman|2008|p=615 et seq}} After Ono was injured in a car accident, Lennon arranged for a king-size bed to be brought to the recording studio as he worked on the Beatles' last album, ''[[Abbey Road]]''.{{sfn|Emerick|Massey|2006|pp=279\u2013280}}\n\nOno and Lennon moved to New York, to a flat on [[Bank Street (Manhattan)|Bank Street]], [[Greenwich Village]].

Klein hired [[May Pang]] as a receptionist in 1969. Through involvement in a project with ABKCO, Lennon and Ono met her the following year. She became their personal assistant. In 1973, after she had been working with the couple for three years, Ono confided that she and Lennon were becoming estranged. She went on to suggest that Pang should begin a physical relationship with Lennon, telling her, \"He likes you a lot.\" Astounded by Ono's proposition, Pang nevertheless agreed to become Lennon's companion. The pair soon left for Los Angeles, beginning an 18-month period he later called his \"[[May Pang#\"Lost Weekend\"|lost weekend]]\".{{sfn|Harry|2000b|pp=698\u2013699}} In Los Angeles, Pang encouraged Lennon to develop regular contact with Julian, whom he had not seen for two years. He also rekindled friendships with Starr, McCartney, Beatles roadie [[Mal Evans]], and [[Harry Nilsson]]. While Lennon was drinking with Nilsson, he misunderstood something that Pang had said and attempted to strangle her. Lennon relented only after he was physically restrained by Nilsson.{{sfn|Harry|2000b|p=700}}\n\nIn June, Lennon and Pang returned to Manhattan in their newly rented penthouse apartment where they prepared a spare room for Julian when he visited them.{{sfn|Harry|2000b|p=700}}  Lennon, who had been inhibited by Ono in this regard, began to reestablish contact with other relatives and friends. By December, he and Pang were considering a house purchase, and he refused to accept Ono's telephone calls. In January 1975, he agreed to meet Ono, who claimed to have found a cure for smoking. After the meeting, he failed to return home or call Pang. When Pang telephoned the next day, Ono told her that Lennon was unavailable because he was exhausted after a hypnotherapy session. Two days later, Lennon reappeared at a joint dental appointment; he was stupefied and confused to such an extent that Pang believed he had been brainwashed. Lennon told Pang that his separation from Ono was now over, although Ono would allow him to continue seeing her as his [[mistress (lover)|mistress]].{{sfn|Harry|2000b|pp=700\u2013701}}\n\n===Sean Lennon===\n[[File:Sean Lennon.jpg|thumb|upright=0.6|right|Sean Lennon at a [[Free Tibet]] event in 1998]]\nOno had previously suffered three [[miscarriage]]s in her attempt to have a child with Lennon. When Ono and Lennon were reunited, she became pregnant again. She initially said that she wanted to have an abortion but changed her mind and agreed to allow the pregnancy to continue on condition that Lennon adopt the role of [[househusband]], which he agreed to do.{{sfn|Harry|2000b|pp=535, 690}}\n\nFollowing Sean's birth, Lennon's subsequent hiatus from the music industry would span five years. He had a photographer take pictures of Sean every day of his first year and created numerous drawings for him, which were posthumously published as ''Real Love: The Drawings for Sean''. Lennon later proudly declared, \"He didn't come out of my belly but, by God, I made his bones, because I've attended to every meal, and to how he sleeps, and to the fact that he swims like a fish.\"{{sfn|Harry|2000b|p=535}}\n\n===Former Beatles===\n{{Further|Collaborations between ex-Beatles|Paul McCartney|George Harrison|Ringo Starr}}\n\n[[File:The Beatles in America.JPG|thumb|right|alt=Black-and-white picture of four young men outdoors in front of a staircase, surrounded by a large assembled crowd.

He was initially close to Harrison, but the two drifted apart after Lennon moved to the US in 1971. When Harrison was in New York for his December 1974 ''[[Dark Horse (George Harrison album)|Dark Horse]]'' tour, Lennon agreed to join him on stage, but failed to appear after an argument over Lennon's refusal to sign an agreement that would finally dissolve the Beatles' legal partnership.{{sfn|Harry|2000b|p=195}}{{refn|group=nb|Lennon eventually signed the papers while he was on holiday in Florida with Pang and Julian.{{sfn|Harry|2000b|p=195}}}} Harrison later said that when he visited Lennon during his five years away from music, he sensed that Lennon was trying to communicate, but his bond with Ono prevented him.{{sfn|The Editors of ''Rolling Stone''|2002|p=146}} Harrison offended Lennon in 1980 when he published an autobiography that made little mention of him.{{sfn|Tillery|2011|p=121}} Lennon told ''[[Playboy]]'', \"I was hurt by it. By glaring omission{{nbsp}}... my influence on his life is absolutely zilch{{nbsp}}... he remembers every two-bit sax player or guitarist he met in subsequent years. I'm not in the book.\"{{sfn|Harry|2000b|p=327}}\n\nLennon's most intense feelings were reserved for McCartney. In addition to attacking him with the lyrics of \"[[How Do You Sleep? (John Lennon song)|How Do You Sleep?]]\", Lennon argued with him through the press for three years after the group split. The two later began to reestablish something of the close friendship they had once known, and in 1974, they even played music together again before eventually growing apart once more. During McCartney's final visit in April 1976, Lennon said that they watched the episode of ''[[Saturday Night Live]]'' in which [[Lorne Michaels]] made a $3,000 offer to get the Beatles to reunite on the show.{{sfn|Harry|2000b|pp=934\u2013935}} According to Lennon, the pair considered going to the studio to make a joke appearance, attempting to claim their share of the money, but were too tired.{{sfn|Sheff|2000|pp=81\u201382}} Lennon summarised his feelings towards McCartney in an interview three days before his death: \"Throughout my career, I've selected to work with{{nbsp}}... only two people: Paul McCartney and Yoko Ono{{nbsp}}... That ain't bad picking.\"{{sfn|Cohn|2010\u20132011|p=95}}\n\nAlong with his estrangement from McCartney, Lennon always felt a musical competitiveness with him and kept an ear on his music. During his career break from 1975 until shortly before his death, according to Fred Seaman, Lennon and Ono's assistant at the time, Lennon was content to sit back as long as McCartney was producing what Lennon saw as mediocre material.{{sfn|Seaman|1991|p=122}} Lennon took notice when McCartney released \"[[Coming Up (song)|Coming Up]]\" in 1980, which was the year Lennon returned to the studio. \"It's driving me crackers!\" he jokingly complained, because he could not get the tune out of his head.{{sfn|Seaman|1991|p=122}} That same year, Lennon was asked whether the group were dreaded enemies or the best of friends, and he replied that they were neither, and that he had not seen any of them in a long time. But he also said, \"I still love those guys. The Beatles are over, but John, Paul, George and Ringo go on.\"{{sfn|Sheff|2000|p=82}}\n\n==Political activism==\n{{Further|Bed-In|Bagism}}\n\n[[File:Jlbedin3.JPG|thumb|alt=Lennon and Ono sit in front of flowers and placards bearing the word \"peace.\" Lennon is only partly visible, and he holds an acoustic guitar.

It took 14 years of litigation to force the FBI to release the withheld pages.{{sfn|Friedman|2005|p=252}} The ACLU, representing Wiener, won a favourable decision in their suit against the FBI in the [[United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit|Ninth Circuit]] in 1991.{{sfn|Wiener|1999|p=315}} The [[United States Department of Justice|Justice Department]] appealed the decision to the [[Supreme Court of the United States|Supreme Court]] in April 1992, but the court declined to review the case.{{sfn|Wiener|1999|pp=52\u201354, 76}} In 1997, respecting President [[Bill Clinton]]'s newly instigated rule that documents should be withheld only if releasing them would involve \"foreseeable harm\", the Justice Department settled most of the outstanding issues outside court by releasing all but 10 of the contested documents.{{sfn|Wiener|1999|pp=52\u201354, 76}}\n\nWiener published the results of his 14-year campaign in January 2000. ''Gimme Some Truth: The John Lennon FBI Files'' contained facsimiles of the documents, including \"lengthy reports by confidential informants detailing the daily lives of anti-war activists, memos to the White House, transcripts of TV shows on which Lennon appeared, and a proposal that Lennon be arrested by local police on drug charges\".{{sfn|Wiener|1999|p=27}} The story is told in the documentary ''The US vs. John Lennon''. The final 10 documents in Lennon's FBI file, which reported on his ties with London anti-war activists in 1971 and had been withheld as containing \"national security information provided by a foreign government under an explicit promise of confidentiality\", were released in December 2006. They contained no indication that the British government had regarded Lennon as a serious threat; one example of the released material was a report that two prominent British leftists had hoped Lennon would finance a left-wing bookshop and reading room.{{sfn|The Associated Press|2006}}\n\n==Writing and art==\n<!-- Put in-line references into this article from books (with page numbers) or from web pages. -->\n\nBeatles biographer [[Bill Harry]] wrote that Lennon began drawing and writing creatively at an early age with the encouragement of his uncle. He collected his stories, poetry, cartoons and caricatures in a Quarry Bank High School exercise book that he called the ''Daily Howl''. The drawings were often of crippled people, and the writings satirical, and throughout the book was an abundance of wordplay. According to classmate Bill Turner, Lennon created the ''Daily Howl'' to amuse his best friend and later Quarrymen bandmate [[Pete Shotton]], to whom he would show his work before he let anyone else see it. Turner said that Lennon \"had an obsession for [[Wigan Pier]]. It kept cropping up\", and in Lennon's story ''A Carrot in a Potato Mine'', \"the mine was at the end of Wigan Pier.\" Turner described how one of Lennon's cartoons depicted a bus stop sign annotated with the question, \"Why?\" Above was a flying pancake, and below, \"a blind man wearing glasses leading along a blind dog \u2013 also wearing glasses\".{{sfn|Harry|2000b|pp=179\u2013181}}\n\nLennon's love of wordplay and nonsense with a twist found a wider audience when he was 24. Harry writes that ''[[In His Own Write]]'' (1964) was published after \"Some journalist who was hanging around the Beatles came to me and I ended up showing him the stuff. They said, 'Write a book' and that's how the first one came about\". Like the ''Daily Howl'' it contained a mix of formats including short stories, poetry, plays and drawings. One story, \"Good Dog Nigel\", tells the tale of \"a happy dog, urinating on a lamp post, barking, wagging his tail \u2013 until he suddenly hears a message that he will be killed at three o'clock\". ''[[The Times Literary Supplement]]'' considered the poems and stories \"remarkable&nbsp;... also very funny&nbsp;... the nonsense runs on, words and images prompting one another in a chain of pure fantasy\". ''Book Week'' reported, \"This is nonsense writing, but one has only to review the [[Literary nonsense|literature of nonsense]] to see how well Lennon has brought it off. While some of his homonyms are gratuitous word play, many others have not only double meaning but a double edge.\" Lennon was not only surprised by the positive reception, but that the book was reviewed at all, and suggested that readers \"took the book more seriously than I did myself. It just began as a laugh for me\".{{sfn|Harry|2000b|pp=393\u2013394}}\n\nIn combination with ''[[A Spaniard in the Works]]'' (1965), ''In His Own Write'' formed the basis of the stage play ''The John Lennon Play: In His Own Write'', co-adapted by [[Victor Spinetti]] and [[Adrienne Kennedy]]. After negotiations between Lennon, Spinetti and the artistic director of the [[Royal National Theatre|National Theatre]], [[Laurence Olivier|Sir Laurence Olivier]], the play opened at [[The Old Vic]] in 1968. Lennon and Ono attended the opening night performance, their second public appearance together.{{sfn|Harry|2000b|pp=396\u2013397}} In 1969, Lennon wrote \"Four in Hand\", a skit based on his teenage experiences of [[Circle jerk (sexual practice)|group masturbation]], for [[Kenneth Tynan]]'s play ''[[Oh! Calcutta!]]''<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.specialsections.absoluteelsewhere.net/LennonLoreLegacy/oh_calcutta.html|title=Oh!

''[[The Beatles Anthology]]'' (2000) also presented examples of his writings and drawings.\n\n==Musicianship==\n\n===Instruments played===\n{{Further|John Lennon's musical instruments|List of the Beatles' instruments}}\n\n[[File:John Lennon's Les Paul Jr..jpg|thumb|Lennon's [[Gibson Les Paul Junior|Les Paul Jr.]]]]\n\nLennon played a mouth organ during a bus journey to visit his cousin in Scotland; the music caught the driver's ear. Impressed, the driver told Lennon of a harmonica he could have if he came to Edinburgh the following day, where one had been stored in the bus depot since a passenger had left it on a bus.{{sfn|Harry|2000b|p=313}} The professional instrument quickly replaced Lennon's toy. He would continue to play the harmonica, often using the instrument during the Beatles' Hamburg years, and it became a signature sound in the group's early recordings. His mother taught him how to play the banjo, later buying him an acoustic guitar. At 16, he played rhythm guitar with the Quarrymen.{{sfn|Harry|2000b|pp=738\u2013740}}\n\nAs his career progressed, he played a variety of electric guitars, predominantly the [[Rickenbacker 325]], [[Epiphone Casino]] and [[Gibson J-160E]], and, from the start of his solo career, the [[Gibson Les Paul Junior]].{{sfn|Prown and Newquist|2003|p=213}}{{sfn|Lawrence|2009|p=27}} ''[[Double Fantasy]]'' producer Jack Douglas claimed that since his Beatle days Lennon habitually tuned his D-string slightly flat, so his Aunt Mimi could tell which guitar was his on recordings.<ref>{{cite web |first=Steve |last=Appleford |title=Yoko Ono Discusses New John Lennon Documentary |work=Rolling Stone |date=6 August 2010 |url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/yoko-ono-discusses-new-john-lennon-documentary-20100806#ixzz2myfyJ4yY |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170614163611/http://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/yoko-ono-discusses-new-john-lennon-documentary-20100806#ixzz2myfyJ4yY |archivedate=14 June 2017  }}</ref> Occasionally he played a six-string bass guitar, the [[Fender Bass VI]], providing bass on some Beatles numbers (\"[[Back in the U.S.S.R.]]\", \"[[The Long and Winding Road]]\", \"[[Helter Skelter (song)|Helter Skelter\"]]) that occupied McCartney with another instrument.{{sfn|Everett|1999|p=297}} His other instrument of choice was the piano, on which he composed many songs, including \"Imagine\", described as his best-known solo work.{{sfn|Blaney|2005|p=83}} His jamming on a piano with McCartney in 1963 led to the creation of the Beatles' first US number one, \"[[I Want to Hold Your Hand]]\".{{sfn|Everett|2001|p=200}} In 1964, he became one of the first British musicians to acquire a [[Mellotron]] keyboard, though it was not heard on a Beatles recording until \"Strawberry Fields Forever\" in 1967.{{sfn|Babiuk|2002|pp=164\u2013165}}\n\n===Vocal style===\nWhen the Beatles recorded \"[[Twist and Shout]]\", the final track during the mammoth one-day session that produced the band's 1963 debut album, ''[[Please Please Me]]'', Lennon's voice, already compromised by a cold, came close to giving out. Lennon said, \"I couldn't sing the damn thing, I was just screaming.\"{{sfn|Wenner|2000|p=14}} In the words of biographer Barry Miles, \"Lennon simply shredded his vocal cords in the interests of rock 'n' roll.\"{{sfn|Miles|2001|p=90}} The Beatles' producer, [[George Martin]], tells how Lennon \"had an inborn dislike of his own voice which I could never understand. He was always saying to me: 'DO something with my voice!{{nbsp}} ... put something on it{{nbsp}}... Make it ''different''.'\"{{sfn|Coleman|1992|pp=369\u2013370}} Martin obliged, often using [[double tracking|double-tracking]] and other techniques.\n\nAs his Beatles era segued into his solo career, his singing voice found a widening range of expression. Biographer Chris Gregory writes of Lennon \"tentatively beginning to expose his insecurities in a number of acoustic-led 'confessional' ballads, so beginning the process of 'public therapy' that will eventually culminate in the primal screams of '[[Cold Turkey]]' and the cathartic ''[[John Lennon/Plastic Ono Band]]''.\"{{sfn|Gregory|2007|p=75}} Music critic Robert Christgau calls this Lennon's \"greatest vocal performance{{nbsp}}... from scream to whine, is modulated electronically{{nbsp}}... echoed, filtered, and double tracked.\"{{sfn|Wiener|1990|p=143}} David Stuart Ryan notes Lennon's vocal delivery to range from \"extreme vulnerability, sensitivity and even naivety\" to a hard \"rasping\" style.{{sfn|Ryan|1982|pp=118, 241}} Wiener too describes contrasts, saying the singer's voice can be \"at first subdued; soon it almost cracks with despair\".{{sfn|Wiener|1990|p=35}} Music historian Ben Urish recalls hearing the Beatles' ''[[The Ed Sullivan Show|Ed Sullivan Show]]'' performance of \"[[This Boy]]\" played on the radio a few days after Lennon's murder: \"As Lennon's vocals reached their peak{{nbsp}}... it hurt too much to hear him scream with such anguish and emotion.

They said that the Beatles' influence cannot be overstated: having \"revolutionised the sound, style, and attitude of popular music and opened rock and roll's doors to a tidal wave of British rock acts\", the group then \"spent the rest of the 1960s expanding rock's stylistic frontiers\".{{sfn|Schinder|Schwartz|2007|p=160}} [[Liam Gallagher]] and his group [[Oasis (band)|Oasis]] were among the many who acknowledged the band's influence; he identified Lennon as a hero.

After the [[Break-up of the Beatles|Beatles disbanded]] in 1970, Lennon continued as a solo artist and as Ono's collaborator.\n\nBorn in [[Liverpool]], Lennon became involved in the [[Skiffle#Revival in the United Kingdom|skiffle craze]] as a teenager. In 1956, he formed his first band, [[the Quarrymen]], which evolved into the Beatles in 1960. He was initially the group's de facto leader, a role gradually ceded to McCartney. Lennon was characterised for the rebellious nature and acerbic wit in his music, writing, drawings, on film and in interviews.  In the mid-1960s, he had two books published: ''[[In His Own Write]]'' and ''[[A Spaniard in the Works]]'', both collections of [[literary nonsense|nonsensical writings]] and line drawings. Starting with 1967's \"[[All You Need Is Love]]\", his songs were adopted as anthems by the [[anti-war movement]] and the larger [[Counterculture of the 1960s|counterculture]].\n\nFrom 1968 to 1972, Lennon produced more than a dozen records with Ono, including a trilogy of [[avant-garde music|avant-garde]] albums, his first solo LP ''[[John Lennon/Plastic Ono Band]]'', and the international top 10 singles <!-- Before adding to this list of Lennon's most significant songs, please seek consensus on the talk page first. Thank you. --> \"[[Give Peace a Chance]]\", \"[[Instant Karma!]]\", \"[[Imagine (John Lennon song)|Imagine]]\" and \"[[Happy Xmas (War Is Over)]]\". Controversial through his political and peace activism, after moving to New York City in 1971, his criticism of the [[Vietnam War]] resulted in a three-year attempt by the [[Presidency of Richard Nixon|Nixon administration]] to deport him. In 1975, Lennon disengaged from the music business to raise his infant son [[Sean Lennon|Sean]], and in 1980, returned with the Ono collaboration ''[[Double Fantasy]]''. He was [[Murder of John Lennon|shot and killed]] in the archway of his [[Manhattan, New York City|Manhattan]] apartment building by a Beatles fan, [[Mark David Chapman]], three weeks after the album's release.\n\nBy 2018, Lennon's solo equivalent album sales had exceeded 72 million units worldwide.<ref name=\"chartmasters.org\">{{cite web |url=https://chartmasters.org/2017/10/best-selling-artists-albums-and-singles-of-all-time/18/ |title=John Lennon's albums and songs sales |date=19 October 2017}}</ref> In 2002, he was voted eighth in a BBC poll of the [[100 Greatest Britons]], and in 2008, ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' ranked him the fifth-greatest singer of all time. In 1987, he was inducted into the [[Songwriters Hall of Fame]].

Alfred was a [[Merchant Navy|merchant seaman]] of [[Irish people|Irish]] descent who was away at the time of his son's birth.{{sfn|Harry|2000b|p=504}} His parents named him John Winston Lennon after his paternal grandfather, John \"Jack\" Lennon, and Prime Minister [[Winston Churchill]].{{sfn|Spitz|2005|p=24: \"Julia offered the name in honour of&nbsp;...

In July 1946, Lennon's father visited her and took his son to [[Blackpool]], secretly intending to emigrate to New Zealand with him.{{sfn|Lennon|2005|p=56: \"Alf admitted to her that he had planned to take John to live in New Zealand\"}} Julia followed them \u2013 with her partner at the time, Bobby Dykins \u2013 and after a heated argument, his father forced the five-year-old to choose between them. In one account of this incident, Lennon twice chose his father, but as his mother walked away, he began to cry and followed her.{{sfn|Spitz|2005|p=30: \"Julia went out of the door&nbsp;... John ran after her\"}} According to author [[Mark Lewisohn]], however, Lennon's parents agreed that Julia should take him and give him a home. A witness who was there that day, Billy Hall, has said that the dramatic portrayal of a young John Lennon being forced to make a decision between his parents is inaccurate.{{sfn|Lewisohn|2013|p=41-42}} Lennon had no further contact with Alf for close to 20 years.{{sfn|Spitz|2005|p=497}}\n\nThroughout the rest of his childhood and adolescence, Lennon lived at [[251 Menlove Avenue|Mendips, 251{{nbsp}}Menlove Avenue]], [[Woolton]], with Mimi and her husband [[George Toogood Smith]], who had no children of their own.{{sfn|Lennon|2005|p=56: \"Hard to see why Mimi wanted John, as she had always said she didn't want children\"}} His aunt purchased volumes of short stories for him, and his uncle, a dairyman at his family's farm, bought him a mouth organ and engaged him in solving {{linktext|crossword}} puzzles.{{sfn|Spitz|2005|p=32: \"When he was old enough, taught John how to solve crossword puzzles\"}} Julia visited Mendips on a regular basis, and when John was 11 years old, he often visited her at 1&nbsp;Blomfield Road, Liverpool, where she played him [[Elvis Presley]] records, taught him the banjo, and showed him how to play \"[[Ain't That a Shame]]\" by [[Fats Domino]].{{sfn|Spitz|2005|p=48: \"To get them started, she applied the triad to 'Ain't That a Shame'\"}} In September 1980, Lennon commented about his family and his rebellious nature:\n\n{{quote|A part of me would like to be accepted by all facets of society and ''not'' be this loudmouthed lunatic poet/musician.

Five ''strong'', ''intelligent'', ''beautiful'' women, five sisters. One happened to be my mother. [She] just couldn't deal with life.

The instrument was an inexpensive [[Gallotone Champion]] acoustic for which she lent her son five pounds and ten shillings on the condition that the guitar be delivered to her own house and not Mimi's, knowing well that her sister was not supportive of her son's musical aspirations.{{sfn|Spitz|2005|p=45}} Mimi was sceptical of his claim that he would be famous one day, and she hoped that he would grow bored with music, often telling him, \"The guitar's all very well, John, but you'll never make a living out of it.\"{{sfn|Norman|2008|p=89}} On 15 July 1958, Lennon's mother was struck and killed by a car while she was walking home after visiting the Smiths' house.{{sfn|Miles|1997|p=48}}\n\nLennon's high school years were marked by a shift in his behaviour.

Named after Quarry Bank High School, the group was established by Lennon in September 1956.{{sfn|Harry|2000b|p=738}} By the summer of 1957, the Quarrymen played a \"spirited set of songs\" made up of half-skiffle and half-[[rock and roll]].{{sfn|Spitz|2005|p=95}} Lennon first met Paul McCartney at the Quarrymen's second performance, which was held in Woolton on 6 July at the [[St Peter's Church, Woolton, Liverpool|St Peter's Church]] garden f\u00eate. Lennon then asked McCartney to join the band.{{sfn|Spitz|2005|pp=93\u201399}}\n\nMcCartney said that Aunt Mimi \"was very aware that John's friends were lower class\", and would often patronise him when he arrived to visit Lennon.{{sfn|Miles|1997|p=44}} According to McCartney's brother [[Mike McGear|Mike]], their father similarly disapproved of Lennon, declaring that Lennon would get his son \"into trouble\".{{sfn|Miles|1997|p=32}} McCartney's father nevertheless allowed the fledgling band to rehearse in the family's front room at [[20 Forthlin Road|20{{nbsp}}Forthlin Road]].{{sfn|Miles|1997|pp=38\u201339}}{{sfn|Lennon|2005|p=47}} During this time Lennon wrote his first song, \"[[Hello Little Girl]]\", which became a UK top 10 hit for [[the Fourmost]] in 1963.{{sfn|Harry|2000b|pp=337\u2013338}}\n\nMcCartney recommended his friend [[George Harrison]] to be the lead guitarist.{{sfn|Miles|1997|pp=47, 50}} Lennon thought that Harrison, then 14 years old, was too young. McCartney engineered an audition on the upper deck of a Liverpool bus, where Harrison played \"[[Raunchy (instrumental)|Raunchy]]\" for Lennon and was asked to join.{{sfn|Miles|1997|pp=47}} [[Stuart Sutcliffe]], Lennon's friend from art school, later joined as bassist.{{sfn|Lennon|2005|p=64}} Lennon, McCartney, Harrison and Sutcliffe became \"The Beatles\" in early 1960. In August that year, the Beatles were engaged for a 48-night [[The Beatles in Hamburg|residency in Hamburg]], in West Germany, and were desperately in need of a drummer. They asked [[Pete Best]] to join them.{{sfn|Miles|1997|p=57}} Lennon's aunt, horrified when he told her about the trip, pleaded with Lennon to continue his art studies instead.{{sfn|Lennon|2005|p=53}} After the first Hamburg residency, the band accepted another in April 1961, and a third in April 1962. As with the other band members, Lennon was introduced to [[Preludin]] while in Hamburg,{{sfn|Miles|1997|pp=66\u201367}} and regularly took the drug as a stimulant during their long, overnight performances.{{sfn|Lennon|2005|p=57}}\n\n[[File:John Lennon (cropped).jpg|left|thumb|upright=0.6|Lennon in 1964]]\n[[Brian Epstein]] managed the Beatles from 1962 until his death in 1967. He had no previous experience managing artists, but he had a strong influence on the group's dress code and attitude on stage.{{sfn|The Beatles|2000|p=67}} Lennon initially resisted his attempts to encourage the band to present a professional appearance, but eventually complied, saying \"I'll wear a bloody balloon if somebody's going to pay me.\"{{sfn|Frankel|2007}} McCartney took over on bass after Sutcliffe decided to stay in Hamburg, and Best was replaced with drummer [[Ringo Starr]]; this completed the four-piece line-up that would remain until the group's break-up in 1970. The band's first single, \"[[Love Me Do]]\", was released in October 1962 and reached No. 17 on the British charts. They recorded their debut album, ''[[Please Please Me]]'', in under 10 hours on 11 February 1963,{{sfn|Harry|2000b|p=721}} a day when Lennon was suffering the effects of a cold,{{sfn|Lewisohn |1988|pp=24\u201326: \"Twist and Shout, which had to be recorded last because John Lennon had a particularly bad cold\"}} which is evident in the vocal on the last song to be recorded that day, \"[[Twist and Shout]]\".{{sfn|Spitz|2005|p=376: \"He had been struggling all day to reach notes, but this was different, this hurt\"}} The Lennon\u2013McCartney songwriting partnership yielded eight of its fourteen tracks. With a few exceptions, one being the album title itself, Lennon had yet to bring his love of wordplay to bear on his song lyrics, saying: \"We were just writing songs{{nbsp}}... pop songs with no more thought of them than that \u2013 to create a sound. And the words were almost irrelevant\".{{sfn|Harry|2000b|p=721}} In a 1987 interview, McCartney said that the other Beatles idolised Lennon: \"He was like our own little Elvis{{nbsp}}... We all looked up to John. He was older and he was very much the leader; he was the quickest wit and the smartest.\"{{sfn|Doggett|2010|p=33}}\n[[File:The Beatles i H\u00f6torgscity 1963.jpg|thumb|Ringo Starr, George Harrison, John Lennon and Paul McCartney in 1963]]\nThe Beatles achieved mainstream success in the UK early in 1963. Lennon was on tour when his first son, [[Julian Lennon|Julian]], was born in April. During their [[Royal Variety Show]] performance, which was attended by the Queen Mother and other British royalty, Lennon poked fun at the audience: \"For our next song, I'd like to ask for your help. For the people in the cheaper seats, clap your hands{{nbsp}}... and the rest of you, if you'll just rattle your jewellery.\"{{sfn|Shennan|2007}} After a year of [[Beatlemania in the United Kingdom|Beatlemania in the UK]], the group's historic February 1964 US debut appearance on ''[[The Ed Sullivan Show]]'' marked their breakthrough to international stardom. A two-year period of constant touring, filmmaking, and songwriting followed, during which Lennon wrote two books, ''[[In His Own Write]]'' and ''[[A Spaniard in the Works]]''.{{sfn|Coleman|1984a|pp=239\u2013240}} The Beatles received recognition from the British establishment when they were appointed [[Order of the British Empire|Members of the Order of the British Empire]] (MBE) in the [[1965 Birthday Honours|1965 Queen's Birthday Honours]].{{sfn|London Gazette|1965|pp=5487\u20135489}}\n\nLennon grew concerned that fans who attended Beatles concerts were unable to hear the music above the screaming of fans, and that the band's musicianship was beginning to suffer as a result.{{sfn|Coleman|1984a|p=288}} Lennon's \"[[Help!

It was me singing 'help'\".{{sfn|Gould|2008|p=268}} He had put on weight (he would later refer to this as his \"Fat Elvis\" period),{{sfn|Lawrence|2005|p=62}} and felt he was subconsciously seeking change.{{sfn|The Beatles|2000|p=171}} In March that year he and Harrison were unknowingly introduced to [[LSD]] when a dentist, hosting a dinner party attended by the two musicians and their wives, spiked the guests' coffee with the drug.{{sfn|Rodriguez|2012|pp=51\u201352}} When they wanted to leave, their host revealed what they had taken, and strongly advised them not to leave the house because of the likely effects. Later, in a lift at a nightclub, they all believed it was on fire; Lennon recalled: \"We were all screaming{{nbsp}}... hot and hysterical.\"{{sfn|Harry|2000b|p=570}}\n{{Anchor|BiggerThanJesus}} In March 1966, during an interview with ''Evening Standard'' reporter [[Maureen Cleave]], Lennon remarked, \"Christianity will go. It will vanish and shrink{{nbsp}}... We're more popular than Jesus now \u2013 I don't know which will go first, rock and roll or Christianity.\"{{sfn|Cleave|2007}} The comment went virtually unnoticed in England but caused [[More popular than Jesus|great offence in the US]] when quoted by a magazine there five months later.

He said that the Beatles song \"[[Getting Better]]\" told his own story, \"I used to be cruel to my woman, and physically \u2013 any woman. I was a hitter. I couldn't express myself and I hit. I fought men and I hit women. That is why I am always on about peace.\"{{sfn|Sheff|2000|p=182}}\n\nRecalling his July 1962 reaction when he learned that Cynthia was pregnant, Lennon said, \"There's only one thing for it Cyn. We'll have to get married.\"{{sfn|Lennon|2005|p=91}} The couple wed on 23 August at the [[Mount Pleasant, Liverpool|Mount Pleasant]] [[Register Office]] in Liverpool, with Brian Epstein serving as best man. His marriage began just as [[Beatlemania in the United Kingdom|Beatlemania]] was taking off across the UK. He performed on the evening of his wedding day and would continue to do so almost daily from then on.{{sfn|Harry|2000b|pp=493\u2013495}} Epstein feared that fans would be alienated by the idea of a married Beatle, and he asked the Lennons to keep their marriage secret. Julian was born on 8 April 1963; Lennon was on tour at the time and did not see his infant son until three days later.{{sfn|Lennon|2005|p=113}}\n\nCynthia attributed the start of the marriage breakdown to Lennon's use of [[LSD]], and she felt that he slowly lost interest in her as a result of his use of the drug.{{sfn|Harry|2000b|pp=496\u2013497}} When the group travelled by train to [[Bangor, Gwynedd|Bangor]], Wales in 1967 for the [[Maharishi Yogi]]'s Transcendental Meditation seminar, a policeman did not recognise her and stopped her from boarding. She later recalled how the incident seemed to symbolise the end of their marriage.{{sfn|Warner Brothers|1988}} After Cynthia arrived home at [[Kenwood, St. George's Hill|Kenwood]], she found Lennon with Ono and left the house to stay with friends. [[Magic Alex|Alexis Mardas]] later claimed to have had sex with her that night, and a few weeks later he informed her that Lennon was seeking a divorce and custody of Julian on the grounds of her adultery with him. After negotiations, Lennon capitulated and agreed to let her divorce him on the same grounds. The case was settled out of court in November 1968, with Lennon giving her \u00a3100,000 ($240,000 in US dollars at the time), a small annual payment and custody of Julian.{{sfn|Lennon|2005|p=305\u2013306: \"He had agreed that I should have custody of Julian\", \"He raised his offer to \u00a3100,000\"}}\n\n===Brian Epstein===\n\n[[File:Aankomst Brian Epstein (manager Beatles) op Schiphol (Grand Gala du Disque 1965), Bestanddeelnr 918-2516 ShiftN.jpg|thumb|upright=0.7|left|Brian Epstein in 1965]]\n\nThe Beatles were performing at Liverpool's [[The Cavern Club|Cavern Club]] in November 1961 when they were introduced to [[Brian Epstein]] after a midday concert. Epstein was homosexual, and according to biographer [[Philip Norman (author)|Philip Norman]], one of Epstein's reasons for wanting to manage the group was that he was attracted to Lennon. Almost as soon as Julian was born, Lennon went on holiday to Spain with Epstein, which led to speculation about their relationship. When he was later questioned about it, Lennon said, \"Well, it was almost a love affair, but not quite. It was never consummated. But it was a pretty intense relationship. It was my first experience with a homosexual that I was conscious was homosexual. We used to sit in a caf\u00e9 in [[Torremolinos]] looking at all the boys and I'd say, 'Do you like that one? Do you like this one?' I was rather enjoying the experience, thinking like a writer all the time: I am experiencing this.\"{{sfn|Harry|2000a|p=232}} Soon after their return from Spain, at McCartney's twenty-first birthday party in June 1963, Lennon physically attacked Cavern Club master of ceremonies [[Bob Wooler]] for saying \"How was your honeymoon, John?\" The MC, known for his wordplay and affectionate but cutting remarks, was making a joke,{{sfn|Harry|2000a|pp=1165, 1169}} but ten months had passed since Lennon's marriage, and the deferred honeymoon was still two months in the future.{{sfn|Lennon|2005|pp=94, 119\u2013120}} Lennon was drunk at the time and the matter was simple: \"He called me a [[queer]] so I battered his bloody ribs in.\"{{sfn|Harry|2000a|p=1169}}\n\nLennon delighted in mocking Epstein for his homosexuality and for the fact that he was Jewish.{{sfn|Harry|2000b|p=232}} When Epstein invited suggestions for the title of his autobiography, Lennon offered ''Queer Jew''; on learning of the eventual title, ''[[A Cellarful of Noise]]'', he parodied, \"More like ''A Cellarful of Boys''\".{{sfn|Coleman|1992|pp=298\u2013299}} He demanded of a visitor to Epstein's flat, \"Have you come to blackmail him? If not, you're the only bugger in London who hasn't.\"{{sfn|Harry|2000b|p=232}} During the recording of \"[[Baby, You're a Rich Man]]\", he sang altered choruses of \"Baby, you're a rich fag Jew\".{{sfn|Norman|2008|p=503}}{{sfn|MacDonald|2005|p=206}}\n\n===Julian Lennon===\n\n[[File:Julian Lennon.jpg|thumb|upright=0.75|[[Julian Lennon]] at the unveiling of the John Lennon Peace Monument]]\n\nDuring his marriage to Cynthia, Lennon's first son [[Julian Lennon|Julian]] was born at the same time that his commitments with the Beatles were intensifying at the height of [[Beatlemania in the United Kingdom|Beatlemania]]. Lennon was touring with the Beatles when Julian was born on 8 April 1963. Julian's birth, like his mother Cynthia's marriage to Lennon, was kept secret because Epstein was convinced that public knowledge of such things would threaten the Beatles' commercial success. Julian recalled that as a small child in [[Weybridge]] some four years later, \"I was trundled home from school and came walking up with one of my watercolour paintings. It was just a bunch of stars and this blonde girl I knew at school. And Dad said, 'What's this?' I said, 'It's Lucy in the sky with diamonds.'\"{{sfn|Harry|2000b|p=517}} Lennon used it as the title of a [[Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds|Beatles song]], and though it was later reported to have been derived from the initials [[Lysergic acid diethylamide|LSD]], Lennon insisted, \"It's not an acid song.\"{{sfn|Harry|2000b|p=574}} Lennon was distant from Julian, who felt closer to McCartney than to his father. During a car journey to visit Cynthia and Julian during Lennon's divorce, McCartney composed a song, \"Hey Jules\", to comfort him. It would evolve into the Beatles song \"[[Hey Jude]]\". Lennon later said, \"That's his best song. It started off as a song about my son Julian{{nbsp}} ... he turned it into 'Hey Jude'. I always thought it was about me and Yoko but he said it wasn't.\"{{sfn|Harry|2000b|p=341}}\n\nLennon's relationship with Julian was already strained, and after Lennon and Ono moved to New York in 1971, Julian did not see his father again until 1973.{{sfn|Pang|2008|loc=back cover}} With Pang's encouragement, arrangements were made for Julian and his mother to visit Lennon in Los Angeles, where they went to [[Disneyland]].{{sfn|Lennon|2005|pp=252\u2013255}} Julian started to see his father regularly, and Lennon gave him a drumming part on a ''[[Walls and Bridges]]'' track.{{sfn|Lennon|2005|p=258}} He bought Julian a [[Gibson Les Paul]] guitar and other instruments, and encouraged his interest in music by demonstrating guitar chord techniques.{{sfn|Lennon|2005|p=258}} Julian recalls that he and his father \"got on a great deal better\" during the time he spent in New York: \"We had a lot of fun, laughed a lot and had a great time in general.\"{{sfn|Times Online|2009}}\n\nIn a ''Playboy'' interview with David Sheff shortly before his death, Lennon said, \"Sean is a planned child, and therein lies the difference. I don't love Julian any less as a child. He's still my son, whether he came from a bottle of whiskey or because they didn't have pills in those days. He's here, he belongs to me, and he always will.\"{{sfn|Sheff|2000|p=63}} He said he was trying to reestablish a connection with the then 17-year-old, and confidently predicted, \"Julian and I will have a relationship in the future.\"{{sfn|Sheff|2000|p=63}} After his death it was revealed that he had left Julian very little in his will.{{sfn|Badman|2003|p=393}}\n\n===Yoko Ono===\n<!-- Put in-line references into this article from books (with page numbers) or from web pages. -->\n[[File:Lennons by Jack Mitchell.jpg|thumb|upright=0.8|right|Lennon and Ono in 1980]]\nLennon first met Yoko Ono on 9 November 1966 at the [[Indica Gallery]] in London, where Ono was preparing her conceptual art exhibit. They were introduced by gallery owner [[John Dunbar (artist)|John Dunbar]].{{sfn|Harry|2000b|p=682}} Lennon was intrigued by Ono's \"Hammer A Nail\": patrons hammered a nail into a wooden board, creating the art piece. Although the exhibition had not yet begun, Lennon wanted to hammer a nail into the clean board, but Ono stopped him. Dunbar asked her, \"Don't you know who this is? He's a millionaire! He might buy it.\" According to Lennon's recollection in 1980, Ono had not heard of the Beatles, but she relented on condition that Lennon pay her five [[wikt:shilling|shillings]], to which Lennon said he replied, \"I'll give you an imaginary five shillings and hammer an imaginary nail in.\"{{sfn|Sheff|2000|p=104}} Ono subsequently related that Lennon had taken a bite out of the apple on display in her work ''[[Apple (artwork)|Apple]]'', much to her fury.<ref name='MOMA'>{{cite web|title=Apple.

They spent the night recording what would become the ''[[Two Virgins]]'' album, after which, he said, they \"made love at dawn\".<ref>''[[Two Virgins]]'' liner notes</ref> When Lennon's wife returned home she found Ono wearing her bathrobe and drinking tea with Lennon who simply said, \"Oh, hi.\"{{sfn|Lennon|1978|p=183}} Ono became pregnant in 1968 and miscarried a male child on 21 November 1968,{{sfn|Harry|2000b|p=510}} a few weeks after Lennon's divorce from Cynthia was granted.{{sfn|Spitz|2005|p=800}}\n\nTwo years before the Beatles disbanded, Lennon and Ono began public protests against the [[Vietnam War]]. They were married in [[Gibraltar]] on 20 March 1969,{{sfn|Coleman|1992|p=705}} and spent their honeymoon at the [[Hilton Amsterdam]], campaigning with a week-long [[Bed-In|Bed-In for Peace]]. They planned another Bed-In in the United States, but were denied entry,{{sfn|Kruse|2009|p=16}} so held one instead at the [[Queen Elizabeth Hotel]] in Montreal, where they recorded \"[[Give Peace a Chance]]\".{{sfn|Harry|2000b|p=276}} They often combined advocacy with performance art, as in their \"[[Bagism]]\", first introduced during a Vienna press conference. Lennon detailed this period in the Beatles song \"[[The Ballad of John and Yoko]]\".{{sfn|Coleman|1992|p=550}} Lennon changed his name by [[deed poll]] on 22 April 1969, adding \"Ono\" as a middle name. The brief ceremony took place on the roof of the [[Apple Corps]] building, where the Beatles had performed [[The Beatles' rooftop concert|their rooftop concert]] three months earlier. Although he used the name John Ono Lennon thereafter, official documents referred to him as John Winston Ono Lennon, since he was not permitted to revoke a name given at birth.{{sfn|Coleman|1984b|p=64}} The couple settled at [[Tittenhurst Park]] at [[Sunninghill, Berkshire|Sunninghill]] in [[Berkshire]].{{sfn|Norman|2008|p=615 et seq}} After Ono was injured in a car accident, Lennon arranged for a king-size bed to be brought to the recording studio as he worked on the Beatles' last album, ''[[Abbey Road]]''.{{sfn|Emerick|Massey|2006|pp=279\u2013280}}\n\nOno and Lennon moved to New York, to a flat on [[Bank Street (Manhattan)|Bank Street]], [[Greenwich Village]].

Klein hired [[May Pang]] as a receptionist in 1969. Through involvement in a project with ABKCO, Lennon and Ono met her the following year. She became their personal assistant. In 1973, after she had been working with the couple for three years, Ono confided that she and Lennon were becoming estranged. She went on to suggest that Pang should begin a physical relationship with Lennon, telling her, \"He likes you a lot.\" Astounded by Ono's proposition, Pang nevertheless agreed to become Lennon's companion. The pair soon left for Los Angeles, beginning an 18-month period he later called his \"[[May Pang#\"Lost Weekend\"|lost weekend]]\".{{sfn|Harry|2000b|pp=698\u2013699}} In Los Angeles, Pang encouraged Lennon to develop regular contact with Julian, whom he had not seen for two years. He also rekindled friendships with Starr, McCartney, Beatles roadie [[Mal Evans]], and [[Harry Nilsson]]. While Lennon was drinking with Nilsson, he misunderstood something that Pang had said and attempted to strangle her. Lennon relented only after he was physically restrained by Nilsson.{{sfn|Harry|2000b|p=700}}\n\nIn June, Lennon and Pang returned to Manhattan in their newly rented penthouse apartment where they prepared a spare room for Julian when he visited them.{{sfn|Harry|2000b|p=700}}  Lennon, who had been inhibited by Ono in this regard, began to reestablish contact with other relatives and friends. By December, he and Pang were considering a house purchase, and he refused to accept Ono's telephone calls. In January 1975, he agreed to meet Ono, who claimed to have found a cure for smoking. After the meeting, he failed to return home or call Pang. When Pang telephoned the next day, Ono told her that Lennon was unavailable because he was exhausted after a hypnotherapy session. Two days later, Lennon reappeared at a joint dental appointment; he was stupefied and confused to such an extent that Pang believed he had been brainwashed. Lennon told Pang that his separation from Ono was now over, although Ono would allow him to continue seeing her as his [[mistress (lover)|mistress]].{{sfn|Harry|2000b|pp=700\u2013701}}\n\n===Sean Lennon===\n[[File:Sean Lennon.jpg|thumb|upright=0.6|right|Sean Lennon at a [[Free Tibet]] event in 1998]]\nOno had previously suffered three [[miscarriage]]s in her attempt to have a child with Lennon. When Ono and Lennon were reunited, she became pregnant again. She initially said that she wanted to have an abortion but changed her mind and agreed to allow the pregnancy to continue on condition that Lennon adopt the role of [[househusband]], which he agreed to do.{{sfn|Harry|2000b|pp=535, 690}}\n\nFollowing Sean's birth, Lennon's subsequent hiatus from the music industry would span five years. He had a photographer take pictures of Sean every day of his first year and created numerous drawings for him, which were posthumously published as ''Real Love: The Drawings for Sean''. Lennon later proudly declared, \"He didn't come out of my belly but, by God, I made his bones, because I've attended to every meal, and to how he sleeps, and to the fact that he swims like a fish.\"{{sfn|Harry|2000b|p=535}}\n\n===Former Beatles===\n{{Further|Collaborations between ex-Beatles|Paul McCartney|George Harrison|Ringo Starr}}\n\n[[File:The Beatles in America.JPG|thumb|right|alt=Black-and-white picture of four young men outdoors in front of a staircase, surrounded by a large assembled crowd.

He was initially close to Harrison, but the two drifted apart after Lennon moved to the US in 1971. When Harrison was in New York for his December 1974 ''[[Dark Horse (George Harrison album)|Dark Horse]]'' tour, Lennon agreed to join him on stage, but failed to appear after an argument over Lennon's refusal to sign an agreement that would finally dissolve the Beatles' legal partnership.{{sfn|Harry|2000b|p=195}}{{refn|group=nb|Lennon eventually signed the papers while he was on holiday in Florida with Pang and Julian.{{sfn|Harry|2000b|p=195}}}} Harrison later said that when he visited Lennon during his five years away from music, he sensed that Lennon was trying to communicate, but his bond with Ono prevented him.{{sfn|The Editors of ''Rolling Stone''|2002|p=146}} Harrison offended Lennon in 1980 when he published an autobiography that made little mention of him.{{sfn|Tillery|2011|p=121}} Lennon told ''[[Playboy]]'', \"I was hurt by it.

I'm not in the book.\"{{sfn|Harry|2000b|p=327}}\n\nLennon's most intense feelings were reserved for McCartney. In addition to attacking him with the lyrics of \"[[How Do You Sleep? (John Lennon song)|How Do You Sleep?]]\", Lennon argued with him through the press for three years after the group split. The two later began to reestablish something of the close friendship they had once known, and in 1974, they even played music together again before eventually growing apart once more. During McCartney's final visit in April 1976, Lennon said that they watched the episode of ''[[Saturday Night Live]]'' in which [[Lorne Michaels]] made a $3,000 offer to get the Beatles to reunite on the show.{{sfn|Harry|2000b|pp=934\u2013935}} According to Lennon, the pair considered going to the studio to make a joke appearance, attempting to claim their share of the money, but were too tired.{{sfn|Sheff|2000|pp=81\u201382}} Lennon summarised his feelings towards McCartney in an interview three days before his death: \"Throughout my career, I've selected to work with{{nbsp}}... only two people: Paul McCartney and Yoko Ono{{nbsp}}... That ain't bad picking.\"{{sfn|Cohn|2010\u20132011|p=95}}\n\nAlong with his estrangement from McCartney, Lennon always felt a musical competitiveness with him and kept an ear on his music. During his career break from 1975 until shortly before his death, according to Fred Seaman, Lennon and Ono's assistant at the time, Lennon was content to sit back as long as McCartney was producing what Lennon saw as mediocre material.{{sfn|Seaman|1991|p=122}} Lennon took notice when McCartney released \"[[Coming Up (song)|Coming Up]]\" in 1980, which was the year Lennon returned to the studio. \"It's driving me crackers!\" he jokingly complained, because he could not get the tune out of his head.{{sfn|Seaman|1991|p=122}} That same year, Lennon was asked whether the group were dreaded enemies or the best of friends, and he replied that they were neither, and that he had not seen any of them in a long time.

In 1983, Wiener sued the FBI with the help of the [[American Civil Liberties Union]] of [[Southern California]]. It took 14 years of litigation to force the FBI to release the withheld pages.{{sfn|Friedman|2005|p=252}} The ACLU, representing Wiener, won a favourable decision in their suit against the FBI in the [[United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit|Ninth Circuit]] in 1991.{{sfn|Wiener|1999|p=315}} The [[United States Department of Justice|Justice Department]] appealed the decision to the [[Supreme Court of the United States|Supreme Court]] in April 1992, but the court declined to review the case.{{sfn|Wiener|1999|pp=52\u201354, 76}} In 1997, respecting President [[Bill Clinton]]'s newly instigated rule that documents should be withheld only if releasing them would involve \"foreseeable harm\", the Justice Department settled most of the outstanding issues outside court by releasing all but 10 of the contested documents.{{sfn|Wiener|1999|pp=52\u201354, 76}}\n\nWiener published the results of his 14-year campaign in January 2000. ''Gimme Some Truth: The John Lennon FBI Files'' contained facsimiles of the documents, including \"lengthy reports by confidential informants detailing the daily lives of anti-war activists, memos to the White House, transcripts of TV shows on which Lennon appeared, and a proposal that Lennon be arrested by local police on drug charges\".{{sfn|Wiener|1999|p=27}} The story is told in the documentary ''The US vs. John Lennon''. The final 10 documents in Lennon's FBI file, which reported on his ties with London anti-war activists in 1971 and had been withheld as containing \"national security information provided by a foreign government under an explicit promise of confidentiality\", were released in December 2006. They contained no indication that the British government had regarded Lennon as a serious threat; one example of the released material was a report that two prominent British leftists had hoped Lennon would finance a left-wing bookshop and reading room.{{sfn|The Associated Press|2006}}\n\n==Writing and art==\n<!-- Put in-line references into this article from books (with page numbers) or from web pages. -->\n\nBeatles biographer [[Bill Harry]] wrote that Lennon began drawing and writing creatively at an early age with the encouragement of his uncle. He collected his stories, poetry, cartoons and caricatures in a Quarry Bank High School exercise book that he called the ''Daily Howl''. The drawings were often of crippled people, and the writings satirical, and throughout the book was an abundance of wordplay. According to classmate Bill Turner, Lennon created the ''Daily Howl'' to amuse his best friend and later Quarrymen bandmate [[Pete Shotton]], to whom he would show his work before he let anyone else see it. Turner said that Lennon \"had an obsession for [[Wigan Pier]]. It kept cropping up\", and in Lennon's story ''A Carrot in a Potato Mine'', \"the mine was at the end of Wigan Pier.\" Turner described how one of Lennon's cartoons depicted a bus stop sign annotated with the question, \"Why?\" Above was a flying pancake, and below, \"a blind man wearing glasses leading along a blind dog \u2013 also wearing glasses\".{{sfn|Harry|2000b|pp=179\u2013181}}\n\nLennon's love of wordplay and nonsense with a twist found a wider audience when he was 24. Harry writes that ''[[In His Own Write]]'' (1964) was published after \"Some journalist who was hanging around the Beatles came to me and I ended up showing him the stuff. They said, 'Write a book' and that's how the first one came about\". Like the ''Daily Howl'' it contained a mix of formats including short stories, poetry, plays and drawings. One story, \"Good Dog Nigel\", tells the tale of \"a happy dog, urinating on a lamp post, barking, wagging his tail \u2013 until he suddenly hears a message that he will be killed at three o'clock\". ''[[The Times Literary Supplement]]'' considered the poems and stories \"remarkable&nbsp;... also very funny&nbsp;... the nonsense runs on, words and images prompting one another in a chain of pure fantasy\". ''Book Week'' reported, \"This is nonsense writing, but one has only to review the [[Literary nonsense|literature of nonsense]] to see how well Lennon has brought it off. While some of his homonyms are gratuitous word play, many others have not only double meaning but a double edge.\" Lennon was not only surprised by the positive reception, but that the book was reviewed at all, and suggested that readers \"took the book more seriously than I did myself. It just began as a laugh for me\".{{sfn|Harry|2000b|pp=393\u2013394}}\n\nIn combination with ''[[A Spaniard in the Works]]'' (1965), ''In His Own Write'' formed the basis of the stage play ''The John Lennon Play: In His Own Write'', co-adapted by [[Victor Spinetti]] and [[Adrienne Kennedy]]. After negotiations between Lennon, Spinetti and the artistic director of the [[Royal National Theatre|National Theatre]], [[Laurence Olivier|Sir Laurence Olivier]], the play opened at [[The Old Vic]] in 1968. Lennon and Ono attended the opening night performance, their second public appearance together.{{sfn|Harry|2000b|pp=396\u2013397}} In 1969, Lennon wrote \"Four in Hand\", a skit based on his teenage experiences of [[Circle jerk (sexual practice)|group masturbation]], for [[Kenneth Tynan]]'s play ''[[Oh!

He would continue to play the harmonica, often using the instrument during the Beatles' Hamburg years, and it became a signature sound in the group's early recordings.

Make it ''different''.'\"{{sfn|Coleman|1992|pp=369\u2013370}} Martin obliged, often using [[double tracking|double-tracking]] and other techniques.\n\nAs his Beatles era segued into his solo career, his singing voice found a widening range of expression. Biographer Chris Gregory writes of Lennon \"tentatively beginning to expose his insecurities in a number of acoustic-led 'confessional' ballads, so beginning the process of 'public therapy' that will eventually culminate in the primal screams of '[[Cold Turkey]]' and the cathartic ''[[John Lennon/Plastic Ono Band]]''.\"{{sfn|Gregory|2007|p=75}} Music critic Robert Christgau calls this Lennon's \"greatest vocal performance{{nbsp}}... from scream to whine, is modulated electronically{{nbsp}}... echoed, filtered, and double tracked.\"{{sfn|Wiener|1990|p=143}} David Stuart Ryan notes Lennon's vocal delivery to range from \"extreme vulnerability, sensitivity and even naivety\" to a hard \"rasping\" style.{{sfn|Ryan|1982|pp=118, 241}} Wiener too describes contrasts, saying the singer's voice can be \"at first subdued; soon it almost cracks with despair\".{{sfn|Wiener|1990|p=35}} Music historian Ben Urish recalls hearing the Beatles' ''[[The Ed Sullivan Show|Ed Sullivan Show]]'' performance of \"[[This Boy]]\" played on the radio a few days after Lennon's murder: \"As Lennon's vocals reached their peak{{nbsp}}... it hurt too much to hear him scream with such anguish and emotion.

They said that the Beatles' influence cannot be overstated: having \"revolutionised the sound, style, and attitude of popular music and opened rock and roll's doors to a tidal wave of British rock acts\", the group then \"spent the rest of the 1960s expanding rock's stylistic frontiers\".{{sfn|Schinder|Schwartz|2007|p=160}} [[Liam Gallagher]] and his group [[Oasis (band)|Oasis]] were among the many who acknowledged the band's influence; he identified Lennon as a hero.

The V-2 rocket also became the first artificial object to travel into space by crossing the [[K\u00e1rm\u00e1n line]] with the vertical launch of [[MW 18014]] on 20 June 1944.<ref>{{cite book |title=The Rocket and the Reich: Peenem\u00fcnde and the Coming of the Ballistic Missile Era |url=https://archive.org/details/isbn_9780029228951 |url-access=registration |last=Neufeld |first=Michael J. |publisher=The Free Press |year=1995 |location=New York |pages=[https://archive.org/details/isbn_9780029228951/page/158 158], 160\u2013162, 190}}</ref>\n\nResearch into military use of long-range rockets began when the studies of graduate student [[Wernher von Braun]] attracted the attention of the German Army. A series of prototypes culminated in the A-4, which went to war as the V-2. Beginning in September 1944, over 3,000 V-2s were launched by the German [[Wehrmacht]] against Allied targets, first [[London]] and later [[Antwerp]] and [[Li\u00e8ge]]. According to a 2011 BBC documentary,{{sfn|Ramsey|2016|p=89}} the attacks from V-2s resulted in the deaths of an estimated 9,000 civilians and military personnel, and a further 12,000 forced laborers and concentration camp prisoners died as a result of their forced participation in the production of the weapons.<ref name=\"Thimm\">''Am Anfang war die V2.

Wernher von Braun and over 100 key V-2 personnel surrendered to the Americans and many of the original V-2 team ended up [[Operation Paperclip|working]] at the [[Redstone Arsenal]]. The US also captured enough V-2 hardware to build approximately 80 of the missiles. The Soviets gained possession of the V-2 manufacturing facilities after the war, re-established V-2 production, and moved it to the Soviet Union.\n\n==Developmental history==\nIn the late 1920s, a young [[Wernher von Braun]] bought a copy of [[Hermann Oberth]]'s book, ''[[Wege zur Raumschiffahrt|Die Rakete zu den Planetenr\u00e4umen]]'' (''The Rocket into Interplanetary Spaces'').<ref name=\"WvB\">[[Wernher von Braun#Early life]].</ref> Starting in 1930, he attended the [[Technical University of Berlin]], where he assisted Oberth in liquid-fueled rocket motor tests.<ref name=\"WvB\"/> Von Braun was working on his doctorate when the [[National Socialist German Workers Party|Nazi Party]] gained power in Germany.<ref name=\"PrusRocketeer\">[[Wernher von Braun#The Prussian rocketeer and working under the Nazis]].</ref> An artillery captain, [[Walter Dornberger]], arranged an Ordnance Department research grant for von Braun, who from then on worked next to Dornberger's existing solid-fuel rocket test site at [[Kummersdorf]].<ref name=\"PrusRocketeer\"/> Von Braun's thesis, ''Construction, Theoretical, and Experimental Solution to the Problem of the Liquid Propellant Rocket'' (dated 16 April 1934), was kept classified by the [[German Army (Wehrmacht)|German Army]] and was not published until 1960.<ref>''Konstruktive, theoretische und experimentelle Beitr\u00e4ge zu dem Problem der Fl\u00fcssigkeitsrakete.

The rocket reached a height of {{cvt|80|km}} after shutting off the engine.<ref>[[History (U.S. TV channel)|The History Channel]] V2 Factory: Nordhausen 070723</ref>\n\nThe fuel and oxidizer pumps were driven by a steam turbine, and the steam was produced by concentrated [[hydrogen peroxide]] ([[T-Stoff]]) with [[sodium permanganate]] ([[Z-Stoff]]) [[catalyst]]. Both the alcohol and oxygen tanks were an aluminium-magnesium alloy.<ref name=Kennedy>{{cite book |last=Kennedy |first=Gregory P. |title=Vengeance Weapon 2: The V-2 Guided Missile |year=1983 |publisher=Smithsonian Institution Press |location=Washington, DC |pages=27, 74}}</ref>\n\nThe [[turbopump]], rotating at 4000 [[rpm]], forced the alcohol and oxygen into the combustion chamber at 33 gallons per second, where they were ignited by a spinning electrical igniter.  Thrust increased to 8 tons during this preliminary stage, before increasing to 25 tons, lifting the 13.5 ton rocket.  Combustion gases exited the chamber at {{convert|5100|\u00b0F|\u00b0C}}, and a speed of 6500 feet per second.  The oxygen to fuel mixture was 1.0:0.85 at 25 tons of thrust, but as [[ambient pressure]] decreased with flight altitude, thrust increased until it reached 29 tons.<ref name=walter>{{cite book |last1=Dornberger |first1=Walter |title=V-2 |date=1954 |publisher=The Viking Press, Inc. |location=New York |pages=17\u201318,120,122\u2013123,132}}</ref><ref name=\"steven\">{{cite book |last1=Zaloga |first1=Steven |title=V-2 Ballistic Missile, 1942\u201352 |date=2003 |publisher=Osprey Publishing |location=Oxford |isbn=9781841765419 |page=19}}</ref><ref name=redstone/>\n\nDr. Thiel's development of the 25 ton rocket motor relied on pump feeding, rather than on the earlier pressure feeding.  The motor was also based on centrifugal injection and film cooling, in which alcohol was admitted into the motor and exhaust nozzle under slight pressure through numerous small perforations.  The injection head was removed from the combustion chamber, which was reduced from 6 to 1 foot, and the connection to the nozzle made cone shaped.  The resultant 1.5 ton chamber operated at a combustion pressure of 220 [[pounds per square inch]].  Thiel's 1.5 ton chamber was then scaled up to a 4.5 ton motor by arranging three injection heads above the combustion chamber.  By 1939, eighteen injection heads in two concentric circles at the head of the 0.12-inch thick sheet-steel chamber, were used to make the 25 ton motor.<ref name=walter/>{{rp|52\u201355}}\n\nThe alcohol-water fuel was pumped along the double wall of the main combustion burner. This [[regenerative cooling (rocket)|regenerative cooling]] heated the fuel and cooled the [[combustion chamber]]. The fuel was then pumped into the main burner chamber through 1,224 nozzles, which assured the correct mixture of alcohol and oxygen at all times. Small holes also permitted some alcohol to escape directly into the combustion chamber, forming a cooled [[boundary layer]] that further protected the wall of the chamber, especially at the throat where the chamber was narrowest. The boundary layer alcohol ignited on contact with the atmosphere, accounting for the long, diffuse exhaust plume. By contrast, later, post-V-2 engine designs not employing this alcohol boundary layer cooling show a translucent plume with [[shock diamond]]s.\n\nThe warhead was another source of troubles. The explosive employed was [[amatol|amatol 60/40]] detonated by an electric [[contact fuze]]. Amatol had the advantage of stability, and the warhead was protected by a thick layer of [[fiberglass]], but even so it could still explode in the re-entry phase. The warhead weighed {{convert|975|kg|lb}} and contained {{convert|910|kg|lb}} of explosive. The warhead's percentage by weight that was explosive was 93%, a very high percentage when compared with other types of munition.\n\nThe protective layer was used for the fuel tanks as well and the A-4 did not have the tendency to form ice, which was common to other early missiles (like the [[balloon tank]]-design [[SM-65 Atlas]]). The tanks held {{convert|4173|kg|lb}} of ethyl alcohol and {{convert|5553|kg|lb}} of oxygen.<ref>War machine encyclopedia, Limited publishing, London 1983 p 1690-92</ref>\n\n[[File:Antwerp V-2.jpg|thumb|Captured V-2 on public display in Antwerp, 1945.

The LEV-3 guidance system consisted of two free [[gyroscope]]s (a horizontal and a vertical) for lateral stabilization, and a [[PIGA accelerometer]] to control engine cutoff at a specified velocity. The V-2 was launched from a pre-surveyed location, so the distance and [[azimuth]] to the target were known. Fin 1 of the missile was aligned to the target azimuth.<ref>Stakem, Patrick H.

Nevertheless, the threat of what was then code-named \"Big Ben\" was great enough that efforts were made to seek countermeasures. The situation was similar to the pre-war concerns about manned bombers and led to a similar solution, the formation of the Crossbow Committee, to collect, examine and develop countermeasures.\n\nEarly on, it was believed that the V-2 employed some form of radio guidance, a belief that persisted in spite of several rockets being examined without discovering anything like a radio receiver. This led to efforts to jam this non-existent guidance system as early as September 1944, using both ground and air-based jammers flying over the UK. In October, a group had been sent to jam the missiles during launch. By December it was clear these systems were having no obvious effect, and jamming efforts ended.<ref name=\"stock25\">Jeremy Stocker, [https://books.google.com/books?id=rr-RAgAAQBAJ&pg=PA20 \"Britain and Ballistic Missile Defence, 1942\u20132002\"], pp. 20\u201328.</ref>\n\n===Anti-aircraft gun system===\nGeneral [[Frederick Alfred Pile]], commander of [[Anti-Aircraft Command]], studied the problem and proposed that enough [[anti-aircraft gun]]s were available to produce a barrage of fire in the rocket's path, but only if provided with a reasonable prediction of the trajectory. The first estimates suggested that 320,000 shells would have to be fired for each rocket. About 2% of these were expected to fall back to the ground, almost 90 tons of rounds, which would cause far more damage than the missile. At a 25 August 1944 meeting of the Crossbow Committee, the concept was rejected.<ref name=stock25/>\n\nPile continued studying the problem, and returned with a proposal to fire only 150 shells at a single rocket, with those shells using a new fuse that would greatly reduce the number that fell back to Earth unexploded. Some low-level analysis suggested that this would be successful against 1 in 50 rockets, provided that accurate trajectories were forwarded to the gunners in time. Work on this basic concept continued and developed into a plan to deploy a large number of guns in [[Hyde Park, London|Hyde Park]] that were provided with pre-configured firing data for {{convert|2.5|mi|km|1|adj=mid|abbr=off}} grids of the London area. After the trajectory was determined, the guns would aim and fire between 60 and 500 rounds.<ref name=stock25/>\n\nAt a Crossbow meeting on 15 January 1945 Pile's updated plan was presented with some strong advocacy from [[Roderic Hill]] and [[Charles Drummond Ellis]]. However, the Committee suggested that a test not be carried out as no technique for tracking the missiles with sufficient accuracy had yet been developed. By March this had changed significantly, with 81% of incoming missiles correctly allotted to the grid square each fell into, or the one beside it. At a 26 March meeting the plan moved ahead, and Pile was directed to a subcommittee with [[RV Jones]] and Ellis to further develop the statistics. Three days later the team returned a report stating that if the guns fired 2,000 rounds at a missile there was a 1 in 60 chance of shooting it down. Plans for an operational test began, but as Pile later put it, \"[[Bernard Montgomery|Monty]] beat us to it\", as the attacks ended with the Allied liberation of their launching areas.<ref name=stock25/>\n\nWith the Germans no longer in control of any part of the continent that could be used as a launching site capable of striking London, they turned their attention to Antwerp. Plans were made to move the Pile system to protect that city, but the war ended before anything could be done.<ref name=stock25/>\n\n===Direct attack===\nAnother defence against the V-2 campaign was to destroy the launch infrastructure\u2014expensive in terms of bomber resources and casualties\u2014or to cause the Germans to aim at the wrong place through [[disinformation]]. The British were able to convince the Germans to direct [[V-1 flying bomb|V-1]]s and V-2s aimed at London to less populated areas east of the city. This was done by sending deceptive reports on the damage caused and sites hit via the German espionage network in Britain, which was controlled by the British (the [[Double-Cross System]]).{{sfn|Ramsey|2016|p=100}}\n\nAccording to the BBC television presenter [[Raymond Baxter]], who served with the RAF during the war, in February 1945 his squadron was carrying out a mission against a V2 launch site, when one missile was launched in front of them. One member of Baxter's squadron opened fire on it, without effect.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.v2rocket.com/start/deployment/denhaag.html|title=V2ROCKET.COM \u2013 Den Haag, Wassenaar, Hoek van Holland|website=www.v2rocket.com}}</ref>\n\nOn 3 March 1945 the Allies attempted to destroy V-2s and launching equipment in the \"Haagse Bos\" in The Hague by a [[Bombing of the Bezuidenhout|large-scale bombardment]], but due to navigational errors the [[Bezuidenhout]] quarter was destroyed, killing 511 Dutch civilians.

A series of prototypes culminated in the A-4, which went to war as the V-2. Beginning in September 1944, over 3,000 V-2s were launched by the German [[Wehrmacht]] against Allied targets, first [[London]] and later [[Antwerp]] and [[Li\u00e8ge]]. According to a 2011 BBC documentary,{{sfn|Ramsey|2016|p=89}} the attacks from V-2s resulted in the deaths of an estimated 9,000 civilians and military personnel, and a further 12,000 forced laborers and concentration camp prisoners died as a result of their forced participation in the production of the weapons.<ref name=\"Thimm\">''Am Anfang war die V2.

Wernher von Braun and over 100 key V-2 personnel surrendered to the Americans and many of the original V-2 team ended up [[Operation Paperclip|working]] at the [[Redstone Arsenal]]. The US also captured enough V-2 hardware to build approximately 80 of the missiles.

The rocket reached a height of {{cvt|80|km}} after shutting off the engine.<ref>[[History (U.S. TV channel)|The History Channel]] V2 Factory: Nordhausen 070723</ref>\n\nThe fuel and oxidizer pumps were driven by a steam turbine, and the steam was produced by concentrated [[hydrogen peroxide]] ([[T-Stoff]]) with [[sodium permanganate]] ([[Z-Stoff]]) [[catalyst]]. Both the alcohol and oxygen tanks were an aluminium-magnesium alloy.<ref name=Kennedy>{{cite book |last=Kennedy |first=Gregory P. |title=Vengeance Weapon 2: The V-2 Guided Missile |year=1983 |publisher=Smithsonian Institution Press |location=Washington, DC |pages=27, 74}}</ref>\n\nThe [[turbopump]], rotating at 4000 [[rpm]], forced the alcohol and oxygen into the combustion chamber at 33 gallons per second, where they were ignited by a spinning electrical igniter.  Thrust increased to 8 tons during this preliminary stage, before increasing to 25 tons, lifting the 13.5 ton rocket.  Combustion gases exited the chamber at {{convert|5100|\u00b0F|\u00b0C}}, and a speed of 6500 feet per second.  The oxygen to fuel mixture was 1.0:0.85 at 25 tons of thrust, but as [[ambient pressure]] decreased with flight altitude, thrust increased until it reached 29 tons.<ref name=walter>{{cite book |last1=Dornberger |first1=Walter |title=V-2 |date=1954 |publisher=The Viking Press, Inc. |location=New York |pages=17\u201318,120,122\u2013123,132}}</ref><ref name=\"steven\">{{cite book |last1=Zaloga |first1=Steven |title=V-2 Ballistic Missile, 1942-52 |date=2003 |publisher=Osprey Publishing |location=Oxford |isbn=9781841765419 |page=19}}</ref><ref name=redstone/>\n\nDr. Thiel's development of the 25 ton rocket motor relied on pump feeding, rather than on the earlier pressure feeding.  The motor was also based on centrifugal injection and film cooling, in which alcohol was admitted into the motor and exhaust nozzle under slight pressure through numerous small perforations.  The injection head was removed from the combustion chamber, which was reduced from 6 to 1 foot, and the connection to the nozzle made cone shaped.  The resultant 1.5 ton chamber operated at a combustion pressure of 220 [[pounds per square inch]].  Thiel's 1.5 ton chamber was then scaled up to a 4.5 ton motor by arranging three injection heads above the combustion chamber.  By 1939, eighteen injection heads in two concentric circles at the head of the 0.12-inch thick sheet-steel chamber, were used to make the 25 ton motor.<ref name=walter/>{{rp|52\u201355}}\n\nThe alcohol-water fuel was pumped along the double wall of the main combustion burner. This [[regenerative cooling (rocket)|regenerative cooling]] heated the fuel and cooled the [[combustion chamber]]. The fuel was then pumped into the main burner chamber through 1,224 nozzles, which assured the correct mixture of alcohol and oxygen at all times. Small holes also permitted some alcohol to escape directly into the combustion chamber, forming a cooled [[boundary layer]] that further protected the wall of the chamber, especially at the throat where the chamber was narrowest. The boundary layer alcohol ignited on contact with the atmosphere, accounting for the long, diffuse exhaust plume. By contrast, later, post-V-2 engine designs not employing this alcohol boundary layer cooling show a translucent plume with [[shock diamond]]s.\n\nThe warhead was another source of troubles. The explosive employed was [[amatol|amatol 60/40]] detonated by an electric [[contact fuze]]. Amatol had the advantage of stability, and the warhead was protected by a thick layer of [[fiberglass]], but even so it could still explode in the re-entry phase. The warhead weighed {{convert|975|kg|lb}} and contained {{convert|910|kg|lb}} of explosive. The warhead's percentage by weight that was explosive was 93%, a very high percentage when compared with other types of munition.\n\nThe protective layer was used for the fuel tanks as well and the A-4 did not have the tendency to form ice, which was common to other early missiles (like the [[balloon tank]]-design [[SM-65 Atlas]]). The tanks held {{convert|4173|kg|lb}} of ethyl alcohol and {{convert|5553|kg|lb}} of oxygen.<ref>War machine encyclopedia, Limited publishing, London 1983 p 1690-92</ref>\n\n[[File:Antwerp V-2.jpg|thumb|Captured V-2 on public display in Antwerp, 1945. Exhaust vanes and external rudders in tail section shown.]]\nThe V-2 was guided by four external rudders on the tail fins, and four internal [[graphite]] vanes in the jet stream at the exit of the motor. The LEV-3 guidance system consisted of two free [[gyroscope]]s (a horizontal and a vertical) for lateral stabilization, and a [[PIGA accelerometer]] to control engine cutoff at a specified velocity. The V-2 was launched from a pre-surveyed location, so the distance and [[azimuth]] to the target were known. Fin 1 of the missile was aligned to the target azimuth.<ref>Stakem, Patrick H.

Nevertheless, the threat of what was then code-named \"Big Ben\" was great enough that efforts were made to seek countermeasures. The situation was similar to the pre-war concerns about manned bombers and led to a similar solution, the formation of the Crossbow Committee, to collect, examine and develop countermeasures.\n\nEarly on, it was believed that the V-2 employed some form of radio guidance, a belief that persisted in spite of several rockets being examined without discovering anything like a radio receiver. This led to efforts to jam this non-existent guidance system as early as September 1944, using both ground and air-based jammers flying over the UK. In October, a group had been sent to jam the missiles during launch. By December it was clear these systems were having no obvious effect, and jamming efforts ended.<ref name=\"stock25\">Jeremy Stocker, [https://books.google.com/books?id=rr-RAgAAQBAJ&pg=PA20 \"Britain and Ballistic Missile Defence, 1942\u20132002\"], pp. 20\u201328.</ref>\n\n===Anti-aircraft gun system===\nGeneral [[Frederick Alfred Pile]], commander of [[Anti-Aircraft Command]], studied the problem and proposed that enough [[anti-aircraft gun]]s were available to produce a barrage of fire in the rocket's path, but only if provided with a reasonable prediction of the trajectory. The first estimates suggested that 320,000 shells would have to be fired for each rocket. About 2% of these were expected to fall back to the ground, almost 90 tons of rounds, which would cause far more damage than the missile. At a 25 August 1944 meeting of the Crossbow Committee, the concept was rejected.<ref name=stock25/>\n\nPile continued studying the problem, and returned with a proposal to fire only 150 shells at a single rocket, with those shells using a new fuse that would greatly reduce the number that fell back to Earth unexploded. Some low-level analysis suggested that this would be successful against 1 in 50 rockets, provided that accurate trajectories were forwarded to the gunners in time. Work on this basic concept continued and developed into a plan to deploy a large number of guns in [[Hyde Park, London|Hyde Park]] that were provided with pre-configured firing data for {{convert|2.5|mi|km|1|adj=mid|abbr=off}} grids of the London area. After the trajectory was determined, the guns would aim and fire between 60 and 500 rounds.<ref name=stock25/>\n\nAt a Crossbow meeting on 15 January 1945 Pile's updated plan was presented with some strong advocacy from [[Roderic Hill]] and [[Charles Drummond Ellis]]. However, the Committee suggested that a test not be carried out as no technique for tracking the missiles with sufficient accuracy had yet been developed. By March this had changed significantly, with 81% of incoming missiles correctly allotted to the grid square each fell into, or the one beside it. At a 26 March meeting the plan moved ahead, and Pile was directed to a subcommittee with [[RV Jones]] and Ellis to further develop the statistics. Three days later the team returned a report stating that if the guns fired 2,000 rounds at a missile there was a 1 in 60 chance of shooting it down. Plans for an operational test began, but as Pile later put it, \"[[Bernard Montgomery|Monty]] beat us to it\", as the attacks ended with the Allied liberation of their launching areas.<ref name=stock25/>\n\nWith the Germans no longer in control of any part of the continent that could be used as a launching site capable of striking London, they turned their attention to Antwerp. Plans were made to move the Pile system to protect that city, but the war ended before anything could be done.<ref name=stock25/>\n\n===Direct attack===\nAnother defence against the V-2 campaign was to destroy the launch infrastructure\u2014expensive in terms of bomber resources and casualties\u2014or to cause the Germans to aim at the wrong place through [[disinformation]]. The British were able to convince the Germans to direct [[V-1 flying bomb|V-1]]s and V-2s aimed at London to less populated areas east of the city. This was done by sending deceptive reports on the damage caused and sites hit via the German espionage network in Britain, which was controlled by the British (the [[Double-Cross System]]).{{sfn|Ramsey|2016|p=100}}\n\nAccording to the BBC television presenter [[Raymond Baxter]], who served with the RAF during the war, in February 1945 his squadron was carrying out a mission against a V2 launch site, when one missile was launched in front of them. One member of Baxter's squadron opened fire on it, without effect.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.v2rocket.com/start/deployment/denhaag.html|title=V2ROCKET.COM - Den Haag, Wassenaar, Hoek van Holland|website=www.v2rocket.com}}</ref>\n\nOn 3 March 1945 the Allies attempted to destroy V-2s and launching equipment in the \"Haagse Bos\" in The Hague by a [[Bombing of the Bezuidenhout|large-scale bombardment]], but due to navigational errors the [[Bezuidenhout]] quarter was destroyed, killing 511 Dutch civilians.

The setup may look similar to the [[R-7 Semyorka|R-7]] launch procedure but in the case of the R-7 the trusses hold the full weight of the rocket, rather than just reacting to side forces.\n\nThe [[PGM-11 Redstone]] rocket is a direct descendant of the V-2.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.centennialofflight.net/essay/Dictionary/REDSTONE/DI149.htm |title=Redstone rocket |publisher=centennialofflight.net |accessdate=27 April 2010 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140220003451/http://www.centennialofflight.net/essay/Dictionary/REDSTONE/DI149.htm |archivedate=20 February 2014 |df=dmy-all }}</ref>\n\n===USSR===\n{{Main|Soviet space program}}\n[[File:\u0410\u0432\u0442\u043e\u043f\u043e\u0435\u0437\u0434 \u0441 \u0440\u0430\u043a\u0435\u0442\u043e\u0439 \u0420-1.jpg|thumb|right|R-1 rocket (V-2 rebuilt by Russia) on a ''Vidalwagen'' at Kapustin Yar]]\nThe [[Soviet Union|USSR]] also captured a number of V-2s and staff, letting them stay in Germany for a time.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.russianspaceweb.com/a4_team_moscow.html#end|title=End of a honeymoon|access-date=2019-06-23|last=Zak|first=Anatoly|publication-date=2012}}</ref> The first work contracts were signed in the middle of 1945.
