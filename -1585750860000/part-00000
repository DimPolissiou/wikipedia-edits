This equilibrium was thought to occur because the climax community is composed of species best adapted to average conditions in that area.  The term is sometimes also applied in [[soil]] development. Nevertheless, it has been found that a \"steady state\" is more apparent than real, particularly if long-enough periods of time are taken into consideration. Notwithstanding, it remains a useful concept.\n\nThe idea of a single climax, which is defined in relation to regional climate, originated with [[Frederic Clements]] in the early 1900s. The first analysis of succession as leading to something like a climax was written by [[Henry Chandler Cowles|Henry Cowles]] in 1899, but it was Clements who used the term \"climax\" to describe the idealized endpoint of succession.<ref>Cowles, Henry Chandler (1899). \"The Ecological Relations of the Vegetation on the Sand Dunes of Lake Michigan\". ''Botanical Gazette'' 27(2): 95-117; 27(3): 167-202; 27(4): 281-308; 27(5): 361-391.</ref>\n\n==Frederic Clements' use of \"climax\"== \nClements described the successional development of an ecological communities comparable to the [[ontogeny|ontogenetic]] development of individual [[organism]]s.<ref>Clements, Frederic E. 1916.

Washington D.C.: Carnegie Institution of Washington.</ref> Clements suggested only comparisons to very simple organisms.<ref>Hagen, Joel B. 1992. An Entangled Bank: The Origins of Ecosystem Ecology. New Brunswick: Rutgers University Press.</ref> Later ecologists developed this idea that the ecological community is a \"[[superorganism]]\" and even sometimes claimed that communities could be homologous to complex organisms and sought to define a single climax-type for each area. The English botanist [[Arthur Tansley]] developed this idea with the \"polyclimax\"\u2014multiple steady-state end-points, determined by [[edaphic]] factors, in a given climatic zone. Clements had called these end-points other terms, not climaxes, and had thought they were not stable because by definition, climax [[vegetation]] is best-adapted to the climate of a given area. [[Henry Gleason]]'s early challenges to Clements's organism simile, and other strategies of his for describing vegetation were largely disregarded for several decades until substantially vindicated by research in the 1950s and 1960s (below). Meanwhile, climax theory was deeply incorporated in both [[theoretical ecology]] and in vegetation management.  Clements's terms such as pre-climax, post-climax, [[plagioclimax]] and disclimax continued to be used to describe the many communities which persist in states that diverge from the climax ideal for a particular area.\n\nThough the views are sometimes attributed to him, Clements never argued that climax communities must always occur, or that the different species in an ecological community are tightly integrated physiologically, or that plant communities have sharp boundaries in time or space. Rather, he employed the idea of a climax community\u2014of the form of vegetation best adapted to some idealized set of environmental conditions\u2014as a conceptual starting point for describing the vegetation in a given area. There are good reasons to believe that the species best adapted to some conditions might appear there when those conditions occur. But much of Clements's work was devoted to characterizing what happens when those ideal conditions do not occur. In those circumstances, vegetation other than the ideal climax will often occur instead. But those different kinds of vegetation can still be described as deviations from the climax ideal. Therefore, Clements developed a very large vocabulary of theoretical terms describing the various possible causes of vegetation, and various non-climax states vegetation adopts as a consequence. His method of dealing with ecological complexity was to define an ideal form of vegetation\u2014the climax community\u2014and describe other forms of vegetation as deviations from that ideal.<ref>Eliot, Christopher. 2007.

May and Simon A. Levin, editors. 1989. Perspectives in Ecological Theory. Princeton: Princeton University Press.</ref> Many authors and nature-enthusiasts continue to use the term \"climax\" in a diluted form to refer to what might otherwise be called mature or [[old growth|old-growth]] communities. The term \"climax\" has also been adopted as a description for a late successional stage for marine macroinvertebrate communities.<ref>Rosenberg R., S. Agrenius, B. Hellman, H. C. Nilsson, and K.

This concept borrows from Clement's earliest interpretation of climax as referring to an ecosystem that is resistant to colonization by outside species. The term disclimax was used in-context by Clements (1936), and despite being an [[Human impact on the environment|anthropogenic]] phenomenon which prevents the facilitation and succession to a true climax community, it is one of the only examples of climax that can be observed in nature.<ref>Clements, Frederic E. 1936.

It was released in January 1976 as the title track and opener of his tenth studio album ''[[Station to Station]]'', as well as on a promotional [[Gramophone record|7-inch single]] in France the same month. Co-produced by Bowie and [[Harry Maslin]], it was written and recorded at [[Cherokee Studios]] in Los Angeles between September and November 1975. At over 10&nbsp;minutes in length, it is Bowie's longest studio recording. Opening with a train-like noise, the song's first half is a slow march, built around an atonal guitar riff, while the second half takes the form of a [[Progressive rock|prog]]-[[disco]] suite that's in a different key and tempo than the first. The song dabbles in [[art rock]] and is influenced by the German electronic bands [[Kraftwerk]] and [[Tangerine Dream]].\n\nLyrically, the song introduces Bowie's sinister persona [[the Thin White Duke]], who became the mouthpiece for ''Station to Station'' and, throughout 1976, often the embodiment of Bowie himself. During the recording, Bowie was heavily dependent on drugs such as [[cocaine]], which is referenced directly throughout the song. \"Station to Station\" also makes references to the [[Kabbalah]], [[occultism]], [[gnosticism]], [[paranoia]] and other fixations that affected Bowie's mind at the time. The opening sound effect is a [[red herring]] meant to represent the [[Stations of the Cross]], along with a juncture connecting two different stages of his career; it combined the [[funk]] and [[Soul music|soul]] of his previous album ''[[Young Americans]]'' with the experimental sound he would take on his [[Berlin Trilogy]].\n\n\"Station to Station\" has received acclaim from music critics, who have praised the performance of the band and Bowie himself. Retrospectively, it has been named one of Bowie's greatest songs and, like its parent album, is seen as the indicator of where Bowie's career was heading at the time. He performed the track throughout the [[Isolar \u2013 1976 Tour|1976 Isolar Tour]], often in character as the Thin White Duke, and continued to perform it on different tours throughout his career. It was remastered, along with its parent album, as part of the box set ''[[Who Can I Be Now? (1974\u20131976)]]'' in 2016.\n\n==Composition==\n\"Station to Station\" was recorded at [[Cherokee Studios]] in Los Angeles between September and November 1975.{{sfn|Doggett|2012|p=285}} During the song's recording, Bowie starved himself of all nutrients except [[milk]], red peppers, and [[cocaine]].<ref name=\"NME\">{{cite web |last1=Barker |first1=Emily |title=David Bowie's 40 greatest songs \u2013 as decided by ''NME'' and friends |url=https://www.nme.com/photos/david-bowie-s-40-greatest-songs-as-decided-by-nme-and-friends-1418012 |website=[[NME]] |accessdate=16 February 2020 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20191103063248/https://www.nme.com/photos/david-bowie-s-40-greatest-songs-as-decided-by-nme-and-friends-1418012 |archivedate=3 November 2019 |date=8 January 2018}}</ref> Bowie would recall later that he could not remember recording the album at all, other than a memory of standing with lead guitarist [[Earl Slick]] in the studio and asking him to play a [[Chuck Berry]]-style riff in the same key throughout the opening of \"Station to Station\".{{sfn|Buckley|2005|p=234}} At over 10 minutes in length, it is Bowie's longest studio recording.{{sfn|Pegg|2016|p=467}} Structurally, the song builds from a droning, guitar-driven introductory portion that mimics a train building up speed.{{sfn|Carr|Murray|1981|pp=78\u201380}} Following the train noise, the band begins to awaken, with percussion and keyboards playing chords in and out of key before the entire band erupts.{{sfn|Doggett|2012|p=287}} What follows is a \"slow, hypnotic instrumental march\", led by an atonal guitar riff played by Bowie and Slick with syncopated accents across three bars in {{music|time|4|4}} and one in {{music|time|2|4}}.<ref name=\"Light RS\" />{{sfn|Doggett|2012|p=287}} The march lasts for more than three minutes before Bowie begins his vocals.<ref name=\"Light RS\" /> After several verses, at the five-minute mark, a thud of drums signals a change of tempo and key and the band erupts into a prog-disco \"celebratory groove\" which lasts for the rest of the track.<ref name=\"Light RS\" /><ref name=\"Needham Guardian\">{{cite web |last1=Needham |first1=Alex |title=My favorite album: ''Station to Station'' by David Bowie |url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/musicblog/2011/sep/16/station-station-david-bowie |website=[[The Guardian]] |accessdate=14 March 2020 |date=16 September 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190406095256/https://www.theguardian.com/music/musicblog/2011/sep/16/station-station-david-bowie |archive-date=6 April 2019 |url-status=live }}</ref>{{sfn|Doggett|2012|p=288}} Doggett likens the section to a [[progressive rock]] suite by the 1970s bands [[Genesis (band)|Genesis]] and [[Jethro Tull (band)|Jethro Tull]].{{sfn|Doggett|2012|p=287}} Like the album, the entire song dabbles in [[art rock]].<ref name=\"AllMusic album\">{{cite web|url=https://www.allmusic.com/album/station-to-station-mw0000098920|title=''Station to Station'' \u2013 David Bowie {{!}} Songs, Reviews, Credits|last=Erlewine|first=Stephen Thomas|website=[[AllMusic]]|access-date=1 August 2019|quote=At its heart, ''Station to Station'' is an avant-garde art-rock album, most explicitly on 'TVC 15' and the epic sprawl of the title track|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190424115507/https://www.allmusic.com/album/station-to-station-mw0000098920|archive-date=24 April 2019|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nThe train sound effect was created by Slick using [[Flanging|flangers]] and delay effects.{{sfn|Carr|Murray|1981|pp=78\u201380}}{{sfn|Doggett|2012|p=287}} The noise pans from right to left across the stereo channels before \"disappearing into a tunnel\" using [[feedback]].{{sfn|Doggett|2012|p=287}} According to biographer [[Nicholas Pegg]], the effect \"acknowledges\" the influence of the 1974 album ''[[Autobahn (album)|Autobahn]]'' by the German [[Electronic music|electronic]] band [[Kraftwerk]], which begins with a car starting up and driving across the stereo speakers.{{sfn|Pegg|2016|p=468}} Pegg believes another influence is from [[Edgar Froese]] of the German electronic band [[Tangerine Dream]], whom Bowie befriended during his \"Berlin\" years; Froese's 1975 album ''[[Epsilon in Malaysian Pale]]'' also begins with a train sound effect.{{sfn|Pegg|2016|p=468}} However, he notes that the train is a [[red herring]] in that it expresses what Bowie later called \"the album's 'wayward spiritual search'.\"{{sfn|Pegg|2016|p=468}} More specifically, it reinstates the \"travelling metaphor\" of earlier compositions: \"the stations recall the 'new surroundings' of \"[[Rock 'n' Roll with Me]]\" [from ''[[Diamond Dogs]]''], and the \"mountains on mountains\" reprise the questing motifs of \"[[Wild Eyed Boy from Freecloud]]\" [from ''[[David Bowie (1969 album)|David Bowie]]'' (1969)] and ''[[The Man Who Sold the World]]''.\"{{sfn|Pegg|2016|p=468}} Bowie would later state, \"the 'Station to Station' track itself is very much concerned with the [[Stations of the Cross]]\",<ref name=Q97X /> the sequence of 14 landmarks on [[Jesus|Christ]]'s path to the [[Crucifixion of Jesus|crucifixion]], each a symbolic stopping-point for prayer.{{sfn|Pegg|2016|p=468}} Stuart Berman of ''[[Pitchfork (website)|Pitchfork]]'' supports this, saying: \"the title track's momentous prog-disco suite&nbsp;[...] charts a course from spiritual void toward ecstatic religious reawakening.\"<ref name=\"Berman Pitchfork\">{{cite web|last=Berman|first=Stuart|url=http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14687-station-to-station-deluxe-edition/|title=David Bowie: ''Station to Station'' (Deluxe Edition)|work=[[Pitchfork (website)|Pitchfork]]|date=29 September 2010|accessdate=22 October 2010|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101021073153/http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14687-station-to-station-deluxe-edition/|archive-date=21 October 2010|url-status=live}}</ref> Another possible influence is guitarist [[Jimmy Page]] of the English rock band [[Led Zeppelin]]. Page was a session musician on Bowie's earliest recordings and had been an occasional acquaintance ever since.{{sfn|Pegg|2016|p=469}} During the same time Bowie became dependant on cocaine, Page had become dependant on [[heroin]] which, according to Pegg, was \"even more fearful\" than Bowie's addiction.{{sfn|Pegg|2016|p=469}} Led Zeppelin's ''[[Physical Graffiti]]'' was released in March 1975,<ref>{{cite AV media notes|title=Physical Graffiti|others=[[Led Zeppelin]]|year=1975|publisher=[[Swan Song Records]]|location=UK|type=liner notes|id=SSK 894007}}</ref> months ahead of the ''Station to Station'' sessions.{{sfn|Pegg|2016|p=469}} Pegg writes: \"It's possible to discern in [\"Station to Station\"] a distinct flavour of the groove, tempo and sense of building tension created by the famous rising riff of ''Physical Graffiti''<nowiki/>'s standout track '[[Kashmir (song)|Kashmir]]'\", an epic track that evokes a \"troubled spiritual journey\" through its music and lyrics.{{sfn|Pegg|2016|p=469}}\n\n==Lyrics==\n[[File:The Thin White Duke 76.jpg|thumb|160px|left|alt=David Bowie performing in 1976 and in character as the Thin White Duke|Bowie in character as the Thin White Duke performing on the [[Isolar \u2013 1976 Tour|1976 Isolar Tour]].]]\n\"Station to Station\" introduces Bowie's persona [[the Thin White Duke]], a sinister figure who became the mouthpiece for ''Station to Station'' and, often throughout 1976, for Bowie himself.<ref>{{cite web |last=Light |first=Alan |url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-features/how-david-bowie-brought-thin-white-duke-to-life-on-station-to-station-125797/ |title=How David Bowie Brought Thin White Duke to Life on 'Station to Station' |work=[[Rolling Stone]] |accessdate=26 December 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181227040904/https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-features/how-david-bowie-brought-thin-white-duke-to-life-on-station-to-station-125797/ |archive-date=27 December 2018 |url-status=live }}</ref>{{sfn|Pegg|2016|p=467}} The persona was noticeably darker than Bowie's previous characters, being described as \"a mad aristocrat\",{{sfn|Carr|Murray|1981|pp=78\u201380}} an \"amoral zombie\",{{sfn|Buckley|2000|p=258}} and \"an emotionless ''[[Aryan race|Aryan]]'' superman\".{{sfn|Pegg|2004|pp=297\u2013300}} For Bowie himself, the Duke was \"a nasty character indeed\".{{sfn|Wilcken|2005|p=24}} The lyrics themselves contain very cryptic messages. Author [[Peter Doggett]] believes the main themes of the track are magic, the arts of legendary musicians, both real and fictitious, the [[Kabbalah]]'s mythical account of progress from Kether to Malkuth, love and cocaine.{{sfn|Doggett|2012|p=286}} Doggett further argues: \"just as [the ''[[Hunky Dory]]'' track] \"[[Quicksand (David Bowie song)|Quicksand]]\" offered a catalogue of avenues open to the inquisitive imagination of David Bowie circa 1971, so \"Station to Station\" present a more confused medley of the themes that were haunting his nightmares in the final weeks of 1975.\"{{sfn|Doggett|2012|p=286}}\n\nThe Duke introduces himself by saying \"the return of the Thin White Duke/throwing darts in lovers' eyes.\"<ref name=\"Needham Guardian\" /> Darts, or arrows, are interpreted to be a symbol of direction revealing the dynamic of the True Will.{{sfn|Doggett|2012|p=286}} Doggett argues that other than the Thin White Duke, another duke was at the heart of the action: [[Prospero]], the Duke of [[Milan]] and protagonist of [[William Shakespeare]]'s play ''[[The Tempest]]''.{{sfn|Doggett|2012|p=285}} He writes that Prospero, like the Thin White Duke, is a \"master of magic\", who can control elements while \"lost in my [magic] circle\", as well as cast spells over \"lovers' eyes\" (mirroring throwing darts), as Prospero does with his daughter [[Miranda (The Tempest)|Miranda]] and her lover [[Ferdinand (The Tempest)|Ferdinand]] over the course of the play.{{sfn|Doggett|2012|pp=285\u2013286}} Fixation with the English [[occultist]] [[Aleister Crowley]] is evident in such phrases as \"[[White Stains|white stains]]\", the name of a book of poetry by Crowley,{{sfn|Wilcken|2005|p=7}} who was previously mentioned by Bowie on \"Quicksand\".{{sfn|Pegg|2016|p=469}} Other references include the 13th century Jewish mystical system known as the Kabbalah and [[gnosticism]].<ref name=Q97X>{{cite book| last=Cavanagh | first=David | title=ChangesFiftyBowie | journal=[[Q (magazine)|Q magazine]] |date=February 1997 | pages=52\u201359}}</ref> Bowie would later claim in 1997: \"All the references within [\"Station to Station\"] have to do with the Kabbalah.\"{{sfn|Doggett|2012|p=286}} Once the song changes into the prog-disco section, the lyrics become brighter. Punctuated by the refrain \"It's too late\",{{sfn|Carr|Murray|1981|pp=78\u201380}} Bowie enters a landscape of \"mountains and sunbirds\".{{sfn|Doggett|2012|p=288}} Themes in this section include drug use, as presented in the lyrics \"It's not the side effects of the cocaine/I'm thinking that it must be love\",{{sfn|Wilcken|2005|p=9}} which he sings in a joyous tone.{{sfn|Doggett|2012|p=288}} Other themes present on the track are [[paranoia]] and odd fixations that were present in Bowie's mind at the time are also recurring themes.<ref name=\"Light RS\" /> At different points Bowie declares \"the European canon (or cannon) is here\", which Doggett believes is a \"pretentious way\" of summarising Bowie's interest in Kraftwerk and [[Brechtian]] theatre.{{sfn|Doggett|2012|p=286}}\n\n==Release and reception==\n\"Station to Station\" was released as the opening title track to Bowie's tenth studio album [[Station to Station|of the same name]] on 23&nbsp;January 1976.<ref name=\"AllMusic album\" /><ref>{{cite AV media notes|title=Station to Station|others=[[David Bowie]]|year=1976|publisher=[[RCA Records|RCA Victor]]|location=UK|type=liner notes|id=APL1 1327}}</ref> The song was also released as a [[promotional single]] (as 42549 A) in January 1976 in France by [[RCA Records]], with a shortened duration of&nbsp;3:40 and \"[[TVC 15]]\" as the B-side.<ref name=\"single liner notes\" /> The single version begins at the central section of the song with the drums just prior to the \"once there were mountains...\" lyric.{{sfn|Pegg|2016|p=470}} The single edit appears on the 2010 Deluxe Edition of ''[[Station to Station]]'' and on ''Re:Call&nbsp;2'', as part of the 2016 box set ''[[Who Can I Be Now?

It was released in January 1976 as the title track and opener of his tenth studio album ''[[Station to Station]]'', as well as on a promotional [[Gramophone record|7-inch single]] in France the same month. Co-produced by Bowie and [[Harry Maslin]], it was written and recorded at [[Cherokee Studios]] in Los Angeles between September and November 1975. At over 10&nbsp;minutes in length, it is Bowie's longest studio recording. Opening with a train-like noise, the song's first half is a slow march, built around an atonal guitar riff, while the second half takes the form of a [[Progressive rock|prog]]-[[disco]] suite that's in a different key and tempo than the first. The song dabbles in [[art rock]] and is influenced by the German electronic bands [[Kraftwerk]] and [[Tangerine Dream]].\n\nLyrically, the song introduces Bowie's sinister persona [[the Thin White Duke]], who became the mouthpiece for ''Station to Station'' and, throughout 1976, often the embodiment of Bowie himself. During the recording, Bowie was heavily dependent on drugs such as [[cocaine]], which is referenced directly throughout the song. \"Station to Station\" also makes references to the [[Kabbalah]], [[occultism]], [[gnosticism]], [[paranoia]] and other fixations that affected Bowie's mind at the time. The opening sound effect is a [[red herring]] meant to represent the [[Stations of the Cross]], along with a juncture connecting two different stages of his career; it combined the [[funk]] and [[Soul music|soul]] of his previous album ''[[Young Americans]]'' with the experimental sound he would take on his [[Berlin Trilogy]].\n\n\"Station to Station\" has received acclaim from music critics, who have praised the performance of the band and Bowie himself. Retrospectively, it has been named one of Bowie's greatest songs and, like its parent album, is seen as the indicator of where Bowie's career was heading at the time. He performed the track throughout the [[Isolar \u2013 1976 Tour|1976 Isolar Tour]], often in character as the Thin White Duke, and continued to perform it on different tours throughout his career. It was remastered, along with its parent album, as part of the box set ''[[Who Can I Be Now? (1974\u20131976)]]'' in 2016.\n\n==Composition==\n\"Station to Station\" was recorded at [[Cherokee Studios]] in Los Angeles between September and November 1975.{{sfn|Doggett|2012|p=285}} During the song's recording, Bowie starved himself of all nutrients except [[milk]], red peppers, and [[cocaine]].<ref name=\"NME\">{{cite web |last1=Barker |first1=Emily |title=David Bowie's 40 greatest songs \u2013 as decided by ''NME'' and friends |url=https://www.nme.com/photos/david-bowie-s-40-greatest-songs-as-decided-by-nme-and-friends-1418012 |website=[[NME]] |accessdate=16 February 2020 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20191103063248/https://www.nme.com/photos/david-bowie-s-40-greatest-songs-as-decided-by-nme-and-friends-1418012 |archivedate=3 November 2019 |date=8 January 2018}}</ref> Bowie would recall later that he could not remember recording the album at all, other than a memory of standing with lead guitarist [[Earl Slick]] in the studio and asking him to play a [[Chuck Berry]]-style riff in the same key throughout the opening of \"Station to Station\".{{sfn|Buckley|2005|p=234}} At over 10 minutes in length, it is Bowie's longest studio recording.{{sfn|Pegg|2016|p=467}} Structurally, the song builds from a droning, guitar-driven introductory portion that mimics a train building up speed.{{sfn|Carr|Murray|1981|pp=78\u201380}} Following the train noise, the band begins to awaken, with percussion and keyboards playing chords in and out of key before the entire band erupts.{{sfn|Doggett|2012|p=287}} What follows is a \"slow, hypnotic instrumental march\", led by an atonal guitar riff played by Bowie and Slick with syncopated accents across three bars in {{music|time|4|4}} and one in {{music|time|2|4}}.<ref name=\"Light RS\" />{{sfn|Doggett|2012|p=287}} The march lasts for more than three minutes before Bowie begins his vocals.<ref name=\"Light RS\" /> After several verses, at the five-minute mark, a thud of drums signals a change of tempo and key and the band erupts into a prog-disco \"celebratory groove\" which lasts for the rest of the track.<ref name=\"Light RS\" /><ref name=\"Needham Guardian\">{{cite web |last1=Needham |first1=Alex |title=My favorite album: ''Station to Station'' by David Bowie |url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/musicblog/2011/sep/16/station-station-david-bowie |website=[[The Guardian]] |accessdate=14 March 2020 |date=16 September 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190406095256/https://www.theguardian.com/music/musicblog/2011/sep/16/station-station-david-bowie |archive-date=6 April 2019 |url-status=live }}</ref>{{sfn|Doggett|2012|p=288}} Doggett likens the section to a [[progressive rock]] suite by the 1970s bands [[Genesis (band)|Genesis]] and [[Jethro Tull (band)|Jethro Tull]].{{sfn|Doggett|2012|p=287}} Like the album, the entire song dabbles in [[art rock]].<ref name=\"AllMusic album\">{{cite web|url=https://www.allmusic.com/album/station-to-station-mw0000098920|title=''Station to Station'' \u2013 David Bowie {{!}} Songs, Reviews, Credits|last=Erlewine|first=Stephen Thomas|website=[[AllMusic]]|access-date=1 August 2019|quote=At its heart, ''Station to Station'' is an avant-garde art-rock album, most explicitly on 'TVC 15' and the epic sprawl of the title track|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190424115507/https://www.allmusic.com/album/station-to-station-mw0000098920|archive-date=24 April 2019|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nThe train sound effect was created by Slick using [[Flanging|flangers]] and delay effects.{{sfn|Carr|Murray|1981|pp=78\u201380}}{{sfn|Doggett|2012|p=287}} The noise pans from right to left across the stereo channels before \"disappearing into a tunnel\" using [[feedback]].{{sfn|Doggett|2012|p=287}} According to biographer [[Nicholas Pegg]], the effect \"acknowledges\" the influence of the 1974 album ''[[Autobahn (album)|Autobahn]]'' by the German [[Electronic music|electronic]] band [[Kraftwerk]], which begins with a car starting up and driving across the stereo speakers.{{sfn|Pegg|2016|p=468}} Pegg believes another influence is from [[Edgar Froese]] of the German electronic band [[Tangerine Dream]], whom Bowie befriended during his \"Berlin\" years; Froese's 1975 album ''[[Epsilon in Malaysian Pale]]'' also begins with a train sound effect.{{sfn|Pegg|2016|p=468}} However, he notes that the train is a [[red herring]] in that it expresses what Bowie later called \"the album's 'wayward spiritual search'.\"{{sfn|Pegg|2016|p=468}} More specifically, it reinstates the \"travelling metaphor\" of earlier compositions: \"the stations recall the 'new surroundings' of \"[[Rock 'n' Roll with Me]]\" [from ''[[Diamond Dogs]]''], and the \"mountains on mountains\" reprise the questing motifs of \"[[Wild Eyed Boy from Freecloud]]\" [from ''[[David Bowie (1969 album)|David Bowie]]'' (1969)] and ''[[The Man Who Sold the World]]''.\"{{sfn|Pegg|2016|p=468}} Bowie would later state, \"the 'Station to Station' track itself is very much concerned with the [[Stations of the Cross]]\",<ref name=Q97X /> the sequence of 14 landmarks on [[Jesus|Christ]]'s path to the [[Crucifixion of Jesus|crucifixion]], each a symbolic stopping-point for prayer.{{sfn|Pegg|2016|p=468}} Stuart Berman of ''[[Pitchfork (website)|Pitchfork]]'' supports this, saying: \"the title track's momentous prog-disco suite&nbsp;[...] charts a course from spiritual void toward ecstatic religious reawakening.\"<ref name=\"Berman Pitchfork\">{{cite web|last=Berman|first=Stuart|url=http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14687-station-to-station-deluxe-edition/|title=David Bowie: ''Station to Station'' (Deluxe Edition)|work=[[Pitchfork (website)|Pitchfork]]|date=29 September 2010|accessdate=22 October 2010|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101021073153/http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14687-station-to-station-deluxe-edition/|archive-date=21 October 2010|url-status=live}}</ref> Another possible influence is guitarist [[Jimmy Page]] of the English rock band [[Led Zeppelin]]. Page was a session musician on Bowie's earliest recordings and had been an occasional acquaintance ever since.{{sfn|Pegg|2016|p=469}} During the same time Bowie became dependant on cocaine, Page had become dependant on [[heroin]] which, according to Pegg, was \"even more fearful\" than Bowie's addiction.{{sfn|Pegg|2016|p=469}} Led Zeppelin's ''[[Physical Graffiti]]'' was released in March 1975,<ref>{{cite AV media notes|title=Physical Graffiti|others=[[Led Zeppelin]]|year=1975|publisher=[[Swan Song Records]]|location=UK|type=liner notes|id=SSK 894007}}</ref> months ahead of the ''Station to Station'' sessions.{{sfn|Pegg|2016|p=469}} Pegg writes: \"It's possible to discern in [\"Station to Station\"] a distinct flavour of the groove, tempo and sense of building tension created by the famous rising riff of ''Physical Graffiti''<nowiki/>'s standout track '[[Kashmir (song)|Kashmir]]'\", an epic track that evokes a \"troubled spiritual journey\" through its music and lyrics.{{sfn|Pegg|2016|p=469}}\n\n==Lyrics==\n[[File:The Thin White Duke 76.jpg|thumb|160px|left|alt=David Bowie performing in 1976 and in character as the Thin White Duke|Bowie in character as the Thin White Duke performing on the [[Isolar \u2013 1976 Tour|1976 Isolar Tour]].]]\n\"Station to Station\" introduces Bowie's persona [[the Thin White Duke]], a sinister figure who became the mouthpiece for ''Station to Station'' and, often throughout 1976, for Bowie himself.<ref>{{cite web |last=Light |first=Alan |url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-features/how-david-bowie-brought-thin-white-duke-to-life-on-station-to-station-125797/ |title=How David Bowie Brought Thin White Duke to Life on 'Station to Station' |work=[[Rolling Stone]] |accessdate=26 December 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181227040904/https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-features/how-david-bowie-brought-thin-white-duke-to-life-on-station-to-station-125797/ |archive-date=27 December 2018 |url-status=live }}</ref>{{sfn|Pegg|2016|p=467}} The persona was noticeably darker than Bowie's previous characters, being described as \"a mad aristocrat\",{{sfn|Carr|Murray|1981|pp=78\u201380}} an \"amoral zombie\",{{sfn|Buckley|2000|p=258}} and \"an emotionless ''[[Aryan race|Aryan]]'' superman\".{{sfn|Pegg|2004|pp=297\u2013300}} For Bowie himself, the Duke was \"a nasty character indeed\".{{sfn|Wilcken|2005|p=24}} The lyrics themselves contain very cryptic messages. Author [[Peter Doggett]] believes the main themes of the track are magic, the arts of legendary musicians, both real and fictitious, the [[Kabbalah]]'s mythical account of progress from Kether to Malkuth, love and cocaine.{{sfn|Doggett|2012|p=286}} Doggett further argues: \"just as [the ''[[Hunky Dory]]'' track] \"[[Quicksand (David Bowie song)|Quicksand]]\" offered a catalogue of avenues open to the inquisitive imagination of David Bowie circa 1971, so \"Station to Station\" present a more confused medley of the themes that were haunting his nightmares in the final weeks of 1975.\"{{sfn|Doggett|2012|p=286}}\n\nThe Duke introduces himself by saying \"the return of the Thin White Duke/throwing darts in lovers' eyes.\"<ref name=\"Needham Guardian\" /> Darts, or arrows, are interpreted to be a symbol of direction revealing the dynamic of the True Will.{{sfn|Doggett|2012|p=286}} Doggett argues that other than the Thin White Duke, another duke was at the heart of the action: [[Prospero]], the Duke of [[Milan]] and protagonist of [[William Shakespeare]]'s play ''[[The Tempest]]''.{{sfn|Doggett|2012|p=285}} He writes that Prospero, like the Thin White Duke, is a \"master of magic\", who can control elements while \"lost in my [magic] circle\", as well as cast spells over \"lovers' eyes\" (mirroring throwing darts), as Prospero does with his daughter [[Miranda (The Tempest)|Miranda]] and her lover [[Ferdinand (The Tempest)|Ferdinand]] over the course of the play.{{sfn|Doggett|2012|pp=285\u2013286}} Fixation with the English [[occultist]] [[Aleister Crowley]] is evident in such phrases as \"[[White Stains|white stains]]\", the name of a book of poetry by Crowley,{{sfn|Wilcken|2005|p=7}} who was previously mentioned by Bowie on \"Quicksand\".{{sfn|Pegg|2016|p=469}} Other references include the 13th century Jewish mystical system known as the Kabbalah and [[gnosticism]].<ref name=Q97X>{{cite book| last=Cavanagh | first=David | title=ChangesFiftyBowie | journal=[[Q (magazine)|Q magazine]] |date=February 1997 | pages=52\u201359}}</ref> Bowie would later claim in 1997: \"All the references within [\"Station to Station\"] have to do with the Kabbalah.\"{{sfn|Doggett|2012|p=286}} Once the song changes into the prog-disco section, the lyrics become brighter. Punctuated by the refrain \"It's too late\",{{sfn|Carr|Murray|1981|pp=78\u201380}} Bowie enters a landscape of \"mountains and sunbirds\".{{sfn|Doggett|2012|p=288}} Themes in this section include drug use, as presented in the lyrics \"It's not the side effects of the cocaine/I'm thinking that it must be love\",{{sfn|Wilcken|2005|p=9}} which he sings in a joyous tone.{{sfn|Doggett|2012|p=288}} Other themes present on the track are [[paranoia]] and odd fixations that were present in Bowie's mind at the time are also recurring themes.<ref name=\"Light RS\" /> At different points Bowie declares \"the European canon (or cannon) is here\", which Doggett believes is a \"pretentious way\" of summarising Bowie's interest in Kraftwerk and [[Brechtian]] theatre.{{sfn|Doggett|2012|p=286}}\n\n==Release and reception==\n\"Station to Station\" was released as the opening title track to Bowie's tenth studio album [[Station to Station|of the same name]] on 23&nbsp;January 1976.<ref name=\"AllMusic album\" /><ref>{{cite AV media notes|title=Station to Station|others=[[David Bowie]]|year=1976|publisher=[[RCA Records|RCA Victor]]|location=UK|type=liner notes|id=APL1 1327}}</ref> The song was also released as a [[promotional single]] (as 42549 A) in January 1976 in France by [[RCA Records]], with a shortened duration of&nbsp;3:40 and \"[[TVC 15]]\" as the B-side.<ref name=\"single liner notes\" /> The single version begins at the central section of the song with the drums just prior to the \"once there were mountains...\" lyric.{{sfn|Pegg|2016|p=470}} The single edit appears on the 2010 Deluxe Edition of ''[[Station to Station]]'' and on ''Re:Call&nbsp;2'', as part of the 2016 box set ''[[Who Can I Be Now?

Collins of ''[[Pitchfork (website)|Pitchfork]]'' calls the track a \"teutonic-occult behemoth\" and a standout of the album.

The municipality covers {{convert|465|km2}} and is on the peninsula of [[Bergenshalv\u00f8yen]]. The city centre and northern neighbourhoods are on [[Byfjorden (Hordaland)|Byfjorden]], 'the city fjord', and the city is surrounded by mountains; Bergen is known as the 'city of [[Seven Mountains, Bergen|seven mountains]]'. Many of the extra-municipal suburbs are on islands. Bergen is the [[administrative centre]] of Hordaland, and consists of eight boroughs: [[Arna, Norway|Arna]], [[Bergenhus]], [[Fana]], [[Fyllingsdalen]], [[Laksev\u00e5g]], [[Ytrebygda]], [[\u00c5rstad, Bergen|\u00c5rstad]], and [[\u00c5sane]].\n\nTrading in Bergen may have started as early as the 1020s. According to tradition, the city was founded in 1070 by king [[Olaf III of Norway|Olav Kyrre]] and was named Bj\u00f8rgvin, 'the green meadow among the mountains'. It served as Norway's capital in the 13th century, and from the end of the 13th century became a [[Kontor|bureau city]] of the [[Hanseatic League]]. Until 1789, Bergen enjoyed exclusive rights to mediate trade between [[Northern Norway]] and abroad and it was the largest city in Norway until the 1830s when it was overtaken by the capital, Christiania (now known as [[Oslo]]). What remains of the quays, [[Bryggen]], is a [[World Heritage Site]]. The city was hit by numerous fires over the years. The [[Bergen School of Meteorology]] was developed at the [[Geophysical Institute, University of Bergen|Geophysical Institute]] starting in 1917, the [[Norwegian School of Economics]] was founded in 1936, and the [[University of Bergen]] in 1946. From 1831 to 1972, Bergen was its own [[counties of Norway|county]]. In 1972 the municipality absorbed four surrounding municipalities and became a part of Hordaland county.\n\nThe city is an international center for [[aquaculture]], [[ship transport|shipping]], the offshore [[petroleum industry]] and [[subsea]] technology, and a national centre for higher education, media, tourism and finance.

Four large bridges connect Bergen to its suburban municipalities.\n\nBergen has a mild winter climate, though with a lot of precipitation. From December to March, Bergen can be, in rare cases, up to 20&nbsp;\u00b0C warmer than Oslo, even though both cities are at about 60\u00b0 North.

Few city blocks akin to those in Nyg\u00e5rd and M\u00f8hlenpris were planned. Many of the worker class built their own homes, and many small, detached apartment buildings were built. After World War II, Bergen had again run short of land to build on, and, contrary to the original plans, many large apartment buildings were built in [[Land\u00e5s]] in the 1950s and 1960s. Bergen acquired [[Fyllingsdalen]] from [[Fana (municipality)|Fana]] municipality in 1955. Like similar areas in Oslo (e.g. [[Lambertseter]]), Fyllingsdalen was developed into a modern suburb with large apartment buildings, [[Tower block|mid-rise]]s, and some single-family homes, in the 1960s and 1970s. Similar developments took place beyond Bergen's city limits, for example in [[Loddefjord]].<ref name=\"bl961\">{{cite encyclopedia |last=Hagen Hartvedt|first=Gunnar|editor= |encyclopedia=Bergen Byleksikon|title=Bergen|url= |edition=1st|year=1994|publisher=Kunnskapsforlaget|location=Oslo|id= |isbn=82-573-0485-9|oclc= |pages=9\u201361|quote= }}</ref>\n[[File:06.05.25 16 Fra Nordnes i Bergen.JPG|thumb|200x200px|View from the Nordnes part of Bergen.]]\nAt the same time as [[New town|planned city]] expansion took place inside Bergen, its extra-municipal suburbs also grew rapidly. Wealthy citizens of Bergen had been living in Fana since the 19th century, but as the city expanded it became more convenient to settle in the municipality. Similar processes took place in [[\u00c5sane]] and Laksev\u00e5g. Most of the homes in these areas are detached [[Terraced house|row house]]s, single family homes or small apartment buildings.<ref name=\"bl961\"/> After the surrounding municipalities were merged with Bergen in 1972, expansion has continued in largely the same manner, although the municipality encourages condensing near commercial centres, future [[Bergen Light Rail]] stations, and elsewhere.<ref name=\"bt_fortetting1\">{{cite news | first=P\u00e5l Andreas | last=M\u00e6land | title=N\u00e5 kommer slangen til Paradis | date=16 May 2008 | url=http://www.bt.no/lokalt/bergen/article564560.ece | archive-url=https://archive.today/20130112052521/http://www.bt.no/lokalt/bergen/article564560.ece | url-status=dead | archive-date=12 January 2013 | work=[[Bergens Tidende]] | accessdate=18 December 2008 | language=Norwegian }}</ref><ref name=\"bt_fortetting2\">{{cite news|first=Eva |last=R\u00f8yrane |title=Bergen bygges tettere |date=9 May 2007 |url=http://bt.no/forbruker/husoghjem/article361530.ece |work=[[Bergens Tidende]] |accessdate=18 December 2008 |language=Norwegian |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110807100820/http://www.bt.no/forbruker/husoghjem/article361530.ece |archivedate=7 August 2011 |df=dmy }}</ref>\n\nAs part of the modernisation wave of the 1950s and 1960s, and due to damage caused by World War II, the [[Local government|city government]] ambitiously planned redevelopment of many areas in central Bergen. The plans involved demolition of several neighbourhoods of wooden houses, namely [[Nordnes]], [[Marken, Bergen|Marken]], and [[St\u00f8len, Bergen|St\u00f8len]]. None of the plans was carried out in its original form; the Marken and St\u00f8len redevelopment plans were discarded and that of Nordnes only carried out in the area that had been most damaged by war. The city council of Bergen had in 1964 voted to demolish the entirety of Marken, however, the decision proved to be highly controversial and the decision was reversed in 1974. Bryggen was under threat of being wholly or partly demolished after the fire of 1955, when a large number of the buildings burned to the ground. Instead of being demolished, the remaining buildings were restored and accompanied by reconstructions of some of the burned buildings.<ref name=\"bl961\"/>\n\nDemolition of old buildings and occasionally whole city blocks is still taking place, the most recent major example being the 2007 razing of Jonsvollskvartalet at [[N\u00f8stet, Bergen|N\u00f8stet]].<ref name=\"bt_jonsvoll\">{{cite news | first=Liv Solli | last=Okkenhaug | title=Rev de siste husene | date=21 April 2007 | url=http://www.bt.no/lokalt/bergen/article357421.ece | work=[[Bergens Tidende]] | accessdate=18 December 2008 | language=Norwegian | url-status=dead | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070427074218/http://www.bt.no/lokalt/bergen/article357421.ece | archivedate=27 April 2007 | df=dmy-all }}</ref>\n\n[[Billboard]]s are banned in the city.<ref>[http://www.amusingplanet.com/2013/07/sao-paulo-city-with-no-outdoor.html S\u00e3o Paulo: The City With No Outdoor Advertisements]</ref>\n\n{{wide image|Brygge Norway 2005-08-18.jpg|1100px|Panorama of the reconstructed Hanseatic buildings of [[Bryggen]], a World Heritage Site}}\n\n==Administration==\n[[File:Kong Oscars gate, Bergen 2018.jpg|thumb|[[Kong Oscars gate]]]]Since 2000, the city of Bergen has been governed by a city government (''byr\u00e5d'') based on the principle of [[parliamentary system|parliamentarism]].<ref name=\"styring\">{{cite web|url=http://www3.bergen.kommune.no/bystyre_/ekstern/styringssystem.html |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071015152459/http://bergen.kommune.no/bystyre_/ekstern/styringssystem.html |archivedate=15 October 2007 |title=Styringssystem |accessdate=9 October 2007 |publisher=Bergen kommune |language=Norwegian |url-status=dead |df=dmy }}</ref> The government consists of seven government members called commissioners, and is appointed by the city council, the supreme authority of the city.

The Danish influence removed the female [[grammatical gender]] in the 16th century, making Bergensk one of very few Norwegian dialects with only two instead of three grammatical genders. The Rs are [[uvular trill]]s, as in French, which probably spread to Bergen some time in the 18th century, overtaking the [[alveolar trill]] in the time span of two to three generations. Owing to an improved [[literacy rate]], Bergensk was influenced by [[Norwegian Bokm\u00e5l|riksm\u00e5l]] and bokm\u00e5l in the 19th and 20th centuries. This led to large parts of the German-inspired [[vocabulary]] disappearing and pronunciations shifting slightly towards East Norwegian.<ref name=\"slikblevi\">{{cite book | title=Slik ble vi bergensere - Hanseatene og bergensdialekten| last=Nesse| first=Agnete|year=2003| publisher=Sigma Forlag| isbn=82-7916-028-0}}</ref>\n\nThe [[Eurovision Song Contest 1986|1986 edition]] of the [[Eurovision Song Contest]] took place in Bergen.

The municipality covers {{convert|465|km2}} and is on the peninsula of [[Bergenshalv\u00f8yen]]. The city centre and northern neighbourhoods are on [[Byfjorden (Hordaland)|Byfjorden]], 'the city fjord', and the city is surrounded by mountains; Bergen is known as the 'city of [[Seven Mountains, Bergen|seven mountains]]'. Many of the extra-municipal suburbs are on islands. Bergen is the [[administrative centre]] of Hordaland, and consists of eight boroughs: [[Arna, Norway|Arna]], [[Bergenhus]], [[Fana]], [[Fyllingsdalen]], [[Laksev\u00e5g]], [[Ytrebygda]], [[\u00c5rstad, Bergen|\u00c5rstad]], and [[\u00c5sane]].\n\nTrading in Bergen may have started as early as the 1020s. According to tradition, the city was founded in 1070 by king [[Olaf III of Norway|Olav Kyrre]] and was named Bj\u00f8rgvin, 'the green meadow among the mountains'. It served as Norway's capital in the 13th century, and from the end of the 13th century became a [[Kontor|bureau city]] of the [[Hanseatic League]]. Until 1789, Bergen enjoyed exclusive rights to mediate trade between [[Northern Norway]] and abroad and it was the largest city in Norway until the 1830s when it was overtaken by the capital, Christiania (now known as [[Oslo]]). What remains of the quays, [[Bryggen]], is a [[World Heritage Site]]. The city was hit by numerous fires over the years. The [[Bergen School of Meteorology]] was developed at the [[Geophysical Institute, University of Bergen|Geophysical Institute]] starting in 1917, the [[Norwegian School of Economics]] was founded in 1936, and the [[University of Bergen]] in 1946. From 1831 to 1972, Bergen was its own [[counties of Norway|county]]. In 1972 the municipality absorbed four surrounding municipalities and became a part of Hordaland county.\n\nThe city is an international center for [[aquaculture]], [[ship transport|shipping]], the offshore [[petroleum industry]] and [[subsea]] technology, and a national centre for higher education, media, tourism and finance.

Natives speak a distinct dialect, known as '[[Bergensk]]'. The city features [[Bergen Airport, Flesland]] and [[Bergen Light Rail]], and is the terminus of the [[Bergen Line]]. Four large bridges connect Bergen to its suburban municipalities.\n\nBergen has a mild winter climate, though with a lot of precipitation. From December to March, Bergen can be, in rare cases, up to 20&nbsp;\u00b0C warmer than Oslo, even though both cities are at about 60\u00b0 North.

Few city blocks akin to those in Nyg\u00e5rd and M\u00f8hlenpris were planned. Many of the worker class built their own homes, and many small, detached apartment buildings were built. After World War II, Bergen had again run short of land to build on, and, contrary to the original plans, many large apartment buildings were built in [[Land\u00e5s]] in the 1950s and 1960s. Bergen acquired [[Fyllingsdalen]] from [[Fana (municipality)|Fana]] municipality in 1955. Like similar areas in Oslo (e.g. [[Lambertseter]]), Fyllingsdalen was developed into a modern suburb with large apartment buildings, [[Tower block|mid-rise]]s, and some single-family homes, in the 1960s and 1970s. Similar developments took place beyond Bergen's city limits, for example in [[Loddefjord]].<ref name=\"bl961\">{{cite encyclopedia |last=Hagen Hartvedt|first=Gunnar|editor= |encyclopedia=Bergen Byleksikon|title=Bergen|url= |edition=1st|year=1994|publisher=Kunnskapsforlaget|location=Oslo|id= |isbn=82-573-0485-9|oclc= |pages=9\u201361|quote= }}</ref>\n[[File:06.05.25 16 Fra Nordnes i Bergen.JPG|thumb|200x200px|View from the Nordnes part of Bergen.]]\nAt the same time as [[New town|planned city]] expansion took place inside Bergen, its extra-municipal suburbs also grew rapidly. Wealthy citizens of Bergen had been living in Fana since the 19th century, but as the city expanded it became more convenient to settle in the municipality. Similar processes took place in [[\u00c5sane]] and Laksev\u00e5g. Most of the homes in these areas are detached [[Terraced house|row house]]s, single family homes or small apartment buildings.<ref name=\"bl961\"/> After the surrounding municipalities were merged with Bergen in 1972, expansion has continued in largely the same manner, although the municipality encourages condensing near commercial centres, future [[Bergen Light Rail]] stations, and elsewhere.<ref name=\"bt_fortetting1\">{{cite news | first=P\u00e5l Andreas | last=M\u00e6land | title=N\u00e5 kommer slangen til Paradis | date=16 May 2008 | url=http://www.bt.no/lokalt/bergen/article564560.ece | archive-url=https://archive.today/20130112052521/http://www.bt.no/lokalt/bergen/article564560.ece | url-status=dead | archive-date=12 January 2013 | work=[[Bergens Tidende]] | accessdate=18 December 2008 | language=Norwegian }}</ref><ref name=\"bt_fortetting2\">{{cite news|first=Eva |last=R\u00f8yrane |title=Bergen bygges tettere |date=9 May 2007 |url=http://bt.no/forbruker/husoghjem/article361530.ece |work=[[Bergens Tidende]] |accessdate=18 December 2008 |language=Norwegian |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110807100820/http://www.bt.no/forbruker/husoghjem/article361530.ece |archivedate=7 August 2011 |df=dmy }}</ref>\n\nAs part of the modernisation wave of the 1950s and 1960s, and due to damage caused by World War II, the [[Local government|city government]] ambitiously planned redevelopment of many areas in central Bergen. The plans involved demolition of several neighbourhoods of wooden houses, namely [[Nordnes]], [[Marken, Bergen|Marken]], and [[St\u00f8len, Bergen|St\u00f8len]]. None of the plans was carried out in its original form; the Marken and St\u00f8len redevelopment plans were discarded and that of Nordnes only carried out in the area that had been most damaged by war. The city council of Bergen had in 1964 voted to demolish the entirety of Marken, however, the decision proved to be highly controversial and the decision was reversed in 1974. Bryggen was under threat of being wholly or partly demolished after the fire of 1955, when a large number of the buildings burned to the ground. Instead of being demolished, the remaining buildings were restored and accompanied by reconstructions of some of the burned buildings.<ref name=\"bl961\"/>\n\nDemolition of old buildings and occasionally whole city blocks is still taking place, the most recent major example being the 2007 razing of Jonsvollskvartalet at [[N\u00f8stet, Bergen|N\u00f8stet]].<ref name=\"bt_jonsvoll\">{{cite news | first=Liv Solli | last=Okkenhaug | title=Rev de siste husene | date=21 April 2007 | url=http://www.bt.no/lokalt/bergen/article357421.ece | work=[[Bergens Tidende]] | accessdate=18 December 2008 | language=Norwegian | url-status=dead | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070427074218/http://www.bt.no/lokalt/bergen/article357421.ece | archivedate=27 April 2007 | df=dmy-all }}</ref>\n\n[[Billboard]]s are banned in the city.<ref>[http://www.amusingplanet.com/2013/07/sao-paulo-city-with-no-outdoor.html S\u00e3o Paulo: The City With No Outdoor Advertisements]</ref>\n\n{{wide image|Brygge Norway 2005-08-18.jpg|1100px|Panorama of the reconstructed Hanseatic buildings of [[Bryggen]], a World Heritage Site}}\n\n==Administration==\n[[File:Kong Oscars gate, Bergen 2018.jpg|thumb|[[Kong Oscars gate]]]]Since 2000, the city of Bergen has been governed by a city government (''byr\u00e5d'') based on the principle of [[parliamentary system|parliamentarism]].<ref name=\"styring\">{{cite web|url=http://www3.bergen.kommune.no/bystyre_/ekstern/styringssystem.html |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071015152459/http://bergen.kommune.no/bystyre_/ekstern/styringssystem.html |archivedate=15 October 2007 |title=Styringssystem |accessdate=9 October 2007 |publisher=Bergen kommune |language=Norwegian |url-status=dead |df=dmy }}</ref> The government consists of seven government members called commissioners, and is appointed by the city council, the supreme authority of the city.

The Danish influence removed the female [[grammatical gender]] in the 16th century, making Bergensk one of very few Norwegian dialects with only two instead of three grammatical genders. The Rs are [[uvular trill]]s, as in French, which probably spread to Bergen some time in the 18th century, overtaking the [[alveolar trill]] in the time span of two to three generations. Owing to an improved [[literacy rate]], Bergensk was influenced by [[Norwegian Bokm\u00e5l|riksm\u00e5l]] and bokm\u00e5l in the 19th and 20th centuries. This led to large parts of the German-inspired [[vocabulary]] disappearing and pronunciations shifting slightly towards East Norwegian.<ref name=\"slikblevi\">{{cite book | title=Slik ble vi bergensere - Hanseatene og bergensdialekten| last=Nesse| first=Agnete|year=2003| publisher=Sigma Forlag| isbn=82-7916-028-0}}</ref>\n\nThe [[Eurovision Song Contest 1986|1986 edition]] of the [[Eurovision Song Contest]] took place in Bergen.
