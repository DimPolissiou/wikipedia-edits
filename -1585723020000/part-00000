It is associated with several well-known composers such as [[Richard Wagner]] and [[Felix Mendelssohn Bartholdy]], but mostly with [[Johann Sebastian Bach]] who worked here as a ''Kapellmeister'' (music director) from 1723 until his death in 1750. Today, the church also holds his remains. [[Martin Luther]] preached here in 1539.\n\nAlthough rebuilt over the centuries and damaged by Allied incendiary bombs in 1943, the church today mainly retains the character of a late-Gothic hall church. The [[Thomanerchor]], the choir of the Thomaskirche, likely founded in 1212, remains a well-known boys' choir.\n\n==History==\nThere has been a church at the current site of the Thomaskirche at least since the 12th century. Foundations of a [[Romanesque architecture|Romanesque]] building have been discovered in the [[Choir (architecture)|choir]] and [[Crossing (architecture)|crossing]] of the current church.<ref name=\"Flyer\"/>{{rp|2}}\n \nBetween 1212 and 1222 the earlier structure became the church of the new St. Thomas Monastery (''Stift'') of the [[Augustinian]] order founded by Markgraf Dietrich von Meissen. This monastery later became the core of the [[University of Leipzig]] (founded in 1409).<ref name=\"Flyer\"/>{{rp|2}} \n\nIn 1217, The Minnesinger, or [[troubadour]] (see [[Minnesang]]), [[Heinrich von Morungen]] bequeathed to the church a relic of [[Thomas the Apostle|St. Thomas]] as he entered the order of canons after a trip to [[India]]. \n\nIn 1355, the Romanesque choir was changed to [[Gothic architecture|Gothic style]]. Following an inflow of wealth into Leipzig from the discovery of silver in the [[Erzgebirge]], the Romanesque nave was demolished and replaced in 1482-96 by the current late-Gothic [[hall church]].<ref name=\"Flyer\"/>{{rp|2}}\n\nThe current building was consecrated by Thilo of Trotha, the [[Bishop of Merseburg]], on 10 April 1496. The [[protestant reformer|reformer]] [[Martin Luther]] preached here on Pentecost Sunday in 1539. The monastic buildings were demolished in 1541 following the monastery's dissolution.\n\nThe current church tower was first built in 1537 and rebuilt in 1702. Chapels added in the 17th century and an ante-building along the northern front of the nave with two stairways were removed at the end of the 19th century.<ref name=\"Flyer\"/>{{rp|2}}\n\n[[File:Vxla-jsbach-at-thomaskirsche.jpg|thumb|upright|Statue of Johann Sebastian Bach at the Thomaskirche]]\n[[File: Grave of Johann Sebastian Bach.jpg|thumb|upright|Bach's grave beneath the floor of the choir (sanctuary) of the church]]\n\nThe composer [[Johann Sebastian Bach]] was choir director of music at St. Thomas Church from 1723 until his death in 1750 and taught at its [[Thomasschule zu Leipzig|affiliated school]]. A statue of Johann Sebastian Bach by the Leipzig sculptor [[Carl Seffner]] that stands next to the church was dedicated in 1908.<ref name=\"Flyer\"/>{{rp|3,5}}\n\nOn 12 May 1789, [[Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart]] played the organ here. In 1806, the church served as a munitions depot for the French army. During the [[Battle of Leipzig]], the Thomaskirche was used as a military hospital.<ref name=\"Flyer\"/>{{rp|5}}\n\n[[Richard Wagner]] was baptized here on 16 August 1813.<ref>''Kirchliches Archiv Leipzig'' (Church Archives of Leipzig): ''Taufbuch Thomas'' 1811-1817 (Baptismal Book for St. Thomas 1811-1817), p. 156</ref> In 1828, he studied piano and counterpoint with the then ''Thomaskantor'', Christian Th. Weinlig.<ref>The Great Composers, Michael Steen, p. 461</ref><ref name=\"Flyer\"/>{{rp|4}}\n\nMost of the Baroque internal trappings of the church known to Bach were removed in a [[Gothic revival]] renovation of 1884-9. Also from this period date the pulpit and the main portal in the west facade.<ref name=\"Flyer\"/>{{rp|2}}\n\nOn 4 December 1943, the tower was damaged in an [[Strategic bombing during World War II|Allied bombing raid]] on Leipzig, requiring repair. The authorities demolished the Johanneskirche, also damaged by bombs in 1943, in 1949 and the remains of Johann Sebastian Bach were moved from there to the Thomaskirche in 1950. \n\nIn the 20th century, [[sulfur]] emitted from nearby [[coal mines]], and other [[Air pollution|pollutants]] in the atmospheric air caused the deterioration of exterior stonework and statuary, and even of interior [[Gothic art#Gothic painting|Gothic paintings]]. In addition, the roof structure suffered from damage due to insects and moisture. For these reasons, the church was listed in the [[2000 World Monuments Watch]] by the [[World Monuments Fund]].<ref>[http://www.wmf.org/project/thomaskirche World Monuments Fund - Thomaskirche]</ref> Repairs were swiftly undertaken with financial support from the Fund and from [[American Express]].\n\nRepairs on the church in 1961 to 1964 also attempted to emphasize the Gothic hall church character of the building. Another renovation followed in 1991.<ref name=\"Flyer\"/>{{rp|2-3}}\n\nFrom 1993 to 2014, a 15th-century Gothic altar (originally in the [[Paulinerkirche, Leipzig|Paulinerkirche]], the church of the University of Leipzig, destroyed in 1968 by the Communist authorities) was located in the Thomaskirche. It was moved to the new St. Pauli church (2014) and replaced in 2016 with a Gothic-revival altar by Constantin Lipsius made in 1888, which had been removed in 1964.<ref name=\"church\">{{cite web|url=https://www.thomaskirche.org/r-bauwerk-a-296.html|title=Kunstwerke (German)|publisher=Ev.- Luth. Kirchgemeinde St. Thomas Leipzig|last=|first=|accessdate=16 January 2018}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Mendelssohn Statue Thomaskirche.jpg|thumb|upright|Mendelssohn statue]]\nA statue of [[Felix Mendelssohn Bartholdy]], who lived in Leipzig from 1835 until his death in 1847, was dedicated on 18 October 2008, when it was re-erected opposite the St. Thomas Church on the occasion of the year of his 200th birthday. The {{convert|6|m|ft|adj=on|sp=us}} statue depicts the former [[Gewandhaus Orchestra]] director and composer in bronze. Celebratory speeches were given by [[Kurt Masur]], also a former Gewandhaus Orchestra director, and Burkhard Jung, mayor of Leipzig. The original statue designed by Werner Stein was first dedicated on 26 May 1892. It had been located on the east side of the Gewandhaus until 9 November 1936, when it was taken down by the [[Nazis]] because of the composer\u2019s Jewish background.\n\n==Description==\nThe churches measures 76 meters in length, of which the nave accounts for 50 meters. The nave is 25 meters wide and its walls reach a maximum height of 18 meters. The church's roof is unusually steep with a [[roof pitch]] of 63 degrees. It rises to a crown that is 45 meters high. The tower is 68 meters in height.<ref name=\"Flyer\">{{cite book|last=|first=|title=Die Thomaskirche zu Leipzig (German)|publisher=Evang. Luthergemeinde St. Thomas-Matth\u00e4i|year=|isbn=|page=}}</ref>{{rp|3}}\n\n===Works of art===\nThe church features a number of works of art, including a baptismal font (1614-5) made by Franz D\u00f6teber and Portraits show the ''Stadtsuperintenden'' of Leipzig, the oldest dating from 1614. A crucifix made by Caspar Freidrich L\u00f6bel is one of the few remaining pieces from the times of Bach. The church also contains a number of notable epitaphs, such as the one for the knight Harras (d. 1451) and for councilor Daniel Leicher (1612). The colored windows in the choir were added after 1889. They show a number of historic motives: a memorial to the fallen of World War I, King [[Gustavus Adolphus of Sweden]], Johann Sebastian Bach, Martin Luther with Elector ''[[Frederick III, Elector of Saxony|Friedrich der Weise]]'' and [[Philip Melanchthon]] as well as Emperor [[Wilhelm I, German Emperor|Wilhelm I]].<ref name=\"Flyer\"/>{{rp|3}} \n\n===Tomb of Johann Sebastian Bach===\nThe remains of Johann Sebastian Bach have been buried in the Thomaskirche since 1950. After his death on 28 July 1750, Bach was laid to rest in the hospital cemetery of the Johanniskirche in Leipzig. With the start of the Bach renaissance in the 19th century, the public started to become interested in his remains and their whereabouts. So, in 1894, the anatomy professor [[Wilhelm His, Sr.|Wilhelm His]] was commissioned to identify the composer\u2019s remains amongst disinterred bones from the cemetery where Bach had been buried. He concluded that \"the assumption that the bones of an elderly man, which had been found in an oak coffin near the Johanneskirche, were the remains of Johann Sebastian Bach\" (translated from German) was very likely. On 16 July 1900 the bones were placed into a stone sarcophagus underneath the Johanniskirche.\n\nFollowing the bombardment of the Johanniskirche on 4 December 1943, the bones were transferred to the Thomaskirche. The new grave with a bronze cover was inaugurated on 28 July 1950, 200 years after the death of the composer, who is now buried in the sanctuary of the Thomaskirche.\n\n===Organs===\nAnother notable feature of the Thomaskirche is that it contains two [[pipe organ|organs]]. The older one is a [[Romanticism|Romantic]] organ by [[Wilhelm Sauer]], built from 1884\u201389. Since this organ was considered \"unsuitable\" for Bach's music, a second organ was built in 1966/7 (by Alexander Schuke). This was later replaced in 1999/2000 by a new organ, built by [[Gerald Woehl]]'s organ building company from 1999\u20132000. This \"Bach organ\" was designed to look similar to the instrument on which Bach had played in the Paulinerkirche.\n\n===Church bells===\nThere are four bells in the St. Thomas bell tower. The largest is the ''Gloriosa'', which was cast by Theodericus Reinhard in 1477. It weighs 5200&nbsp;kg, has a diameter of 2.04 meters, and a strike pitch of a\u00b0. It is used on days of celebration. The second-largest bell was cast by Wolf Hilliger in 1574 and has a [[strike tone|strike note]] of c\u2032. The third largest bell is called either the Monks\u2019 or Confessional Bell (''M\u00f6nchs- oder Beichtglocke''), which has a strike pitch of d\u2032. Jakob K\u00f6nig cast it in 1634 and it serves as the hourly bell. The fourth bell was cast by Christophorus Gros in 1585 and has a strike note of f\u2033. Its resonance is dampened by shortened yokes from which it hangs. The tower lantern holds separately a bell that is rung each quarter-hour. This bell was cast in 1539 by the Schilling bell foundry in [[Apolda]]. It was modelled on its predecessor.\n\n==Choir==\nThe [[Thomanerchor]], the choir of the Thomaskirche, was founded in 1212 and is one of the oldest and most famous boys' [[choir]]s in Germany.

It is associated with several well-known composers such as [[Richard Wagner]] and [[Felix Mendelssohn Bartholdy]], but mostly with [[Johann Sebastian Bach]] who worked here as a ''Kapellmeister'' (music director) from 1723 until his death in 1750. Today, the church also holds his remains. [[Martin Luther]] preached here in 1539.\n\nAlthough rebuilt over the centuries and damaged by Allied incendiary bombs in 1943, the church today mainly retains the character of a late-Gothic hall church. The [[Thomanerchor]], the choir of the Thomaskirche, likely founded in 1212, remains a well-known boys' choir.\n\n==History==\nThere has been a church at the current site of the Thomaskirche at least since the 12th century. Foundations of a [[Romanesque architecture|Romanesque]] building have been discovered in the [[Choir (architecture)|choir]] and [[Crossing (architecture)|crossing]] of the current church.<ref name=\"Flyer\"/>{{rp|2}}\n \nBetween 1212 and 1222 the earlier structure became the church of the new St. Thomas Monastery (''Stift'') of the [[Augustinian]] order founded by Markgraf Dietrich von Meissen. This monastery later became the core of the [[University of Leipzig]] (founded in 1409).<ref name=\"Flyer\"/>{{rp|2}} \n\nIn 1217, The Minnesinger, or [[troubadour]] (see [[Minnesang]]), [[Heinrich von Morungen]] bequeathed to the church a relic of [[Thomas the Apostle|St. Thomas]] as he entered the order of canons after a trip to [[India]]. \n\nIn 1355, the Romanesque choir was changed to [[Gothic architecture|Gothic style]]. Following an inflow of wealth into Leipzig from the discovery of silver in the [[Erzgebirge]], the Romanesque nave was demolished and replaced in 1482-96 by the current late-Gothic [[hall church]].<ref name=\"Flyer\"/>{{rp|2}}\n\nThe current building was consecrated by Thilo of Trotha, the [[Bishop of Merseburg]], on 10 April 1496. The [[protestant reformer|reformer]] [[Martin Luther]] preached here on Pentecost Sunday in 1539. The monastic buildings were demolished in 1541 following the monastery's dissolution.\n\nThe current church tower was first built in 1537 and rebuilt in 1702. Chapels added in the 17th century and an ante-building along the northern front of the nave with two stairways were removed at the end of the 19th century.<ref name=\"Flyer\"/>{{rp|2}}\n\n[[File:Vxla-jsbach-at-thomaskirsche.jpg|thumb|upright|Statue of Johann Sebastian Bach at the Thomaskirche]]\n[[File: Grave of Johann Sebastian Bach.jpg|thumb|upright|Bach's grave beneath the floor of the choir (sanctuary) of the church]]\n\nThe composer [[Johann Sebastian Bach]] was choir director of music at St. Thomas Church from 1723 until his death in 1750 and taught at its [[Thomasschule zu Leipzig|affiliated school]]. A statue of Johann Sebastian Bach by the Leipzig sculptor [[Carl Seffner]] that stands next to the church was dedicated in 1908.<ref name=\"Flyer\"/>{{rp|3,5}}\n\nOn 12 May 1789, [[Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart]] played the organ here. In 1806, the church served as a munitions depot for the French army. During the [[Battle of Leipzig]], the Thomaskirche was used as a military hospital.<ref name=\"Flyer\"/>{{rp|5}}\n\n[[Richard Wagner]] was baptized here on 16 August 1813.<ref>''Kirchliches Archiv Leipzig'' (Church Archives of Leipzig): ''Taufbuch Thomas'' 1811-1817 (Baptismal Book for St. Thomas 1811-1817), p. 156</ref> In 1828, he studied piano and counterpoint with the then ''Thomaskantor'', Christian Th. Weinlig.<ref>The Great Composers, Michael Steen, p. 461</ref><ref name=\"Flyer\"/>{{rp|4}}\n\nMost of the Baroque internal trappings of the church known to Bach were removed in a [[Gothic revival]] renovation of 1884-9. Also from this period date the pulpit and the main portal in the west facade.<ref name=\"Flyer\"/>{{rp|2}}\n\nOn 4 December 1943, the tower was damaged in an [[Strategic bombing during World War II|Allied bombing raid]] on Leipzig, requiring repair. The authorities demolished the Johanneskirche, also damaged by bombs in 1943, in 1949 and the remains of Johann Sebastian Bach were moved from there to the Thomaskirche in 1950. \n\nIn the 20th century, [[sulfur]] emitted from nearby [[coal mines]], and other [[Air pollution|pollutants]] in the atmospheric air caused the deterioration of exterior stonework and statuary, and even of interior [[Gothic art#Gothic painting|Gothic paintings]]. In addition, the roof structure suffered from damage due to insects and moisture. For these reasons, the church was listed in the [[2000 World Monuments Watch]] by the [[World Monuments Fund]].<ref>[http://www.wmf.org/project/thomaskirche World Monuments Fund - Thomaskirche]</ref> Repairs were swiftly undertaken with financial support from the Fund and from [[American Express]].\n\nRepairs on the church in 1961 to 1964 also attempted to emphasize the Gothic hall church character of the building. Another renovation followed in 1991.<ref name=\"Flyer\"/>{{rp|2-3}}\n\nFrom 1993 to 2014, a 15th-century Gothic altar (originally in the [[Paulinerkirche, Leipzig|Paulinerkirche]], the church of the University of Leipzig, destroyed in 1968 by the Communist authorities) was located in the Thomaskirche. It was moved to the new St. Pauli church (2014) and replaced in 2016 with a Gothic-revival altar by Constantin Lipsius made in 1888, which had been removed in 1964.<ref name=\"church\">{{cite web|url=https://www.thomaskirche.org/r-bauwerk-a-296.html|title=Kunstwerke (German)|publisher=Ev.- Luth. Kirchgemeinde St. Thomas Leipzig|last=|first=|accessdate=16 January 2018}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Mendelssohn Statue Thomaskirche.jpg|thumb|upright|Mendelssohn statue]]\nA statue of [[Felix Mendelssohn Bartholdy]], who lived in Leipzig from 1835 until his death in 1847, was dedicated on 18 October 2008, when it was re-erected opposite the St. Thomas Church on the occasion of the year of his 200th birthday. The {{convert|6|m|ft|adj=on|sp=us}} statue depicts the former [[Gewandhaus Orchestra]] director and composer in bronze. Celebratory speeches were given by [[Kurt Masur]], also a former Gewandhaus Orchestra director, and Burkhard Jung, mayor of Leipzig. The original statue designed by Werner Stein was first dedicated on 26 May 1892. It had been located on the east side of the Gewandhaus until 9 November 1936, when it was taken down by the [[Nazis]] because of the composer\u2019s Jewish background.\n\n==Description==\nThe churches measures 76 meters in length, of which the nave accounts for 50 meters. The nave is 25 meters wide and its walls reach a maximum height of 18 meters. The church's roof is unusually steep with a [[roof pitch]] of 63 degrees. It rises to a crown that is 45 meters high. The tower is 68 meters in height.<ref name=\"Flyer\">{{cite book|last=|first=|title=Die Thomaskirche zu Leipzig (German)|publisher=Evang. Luthergemeinde St. Thomas-Matth\u00e4i|year=|isbn=|page=}}</ref>{{rp|3}}\n\n===Works of art===\nThe church features a number of works of art, including a baptismal font (1614-5) made by Franz D\u00f6teber and Portraits show the ''Stadtsuperintenden'' of Leipzig, the oldest dating from 1614. A crucifix made by Caspar Freidrich L\u00f6bel is one of the few remaining pieces from the times of Bach. The church also contains a number of notable epitaphs, such as the one for the knight Harras (d. 1451) and for councilor Daniel Leicher (1612). The colored windows in the choir were added after 1889. They show a number of historic motives: a memorial to the fallen of World War I, King [[Gustavus Adolphus of Sweden]], Johann Sebastian Bach, Martin Luther with Elector ''[[Frederick III, Elector of Saxony|Friedrich der Weise]]'' and [[Philip Melanchthon]] as well as Emperor [[Wilhelm I, German Emperor|Wilhelm I]].<ref name=\"Flyer\"/>{{rp|3}} \n\n===Tomb of Johann Sebastian Bach===\nThe remains of Johann Sebastian Bach have been buried in the Thomaskirche since 1950. After his death on 28 July 1750, Bach was laid to rest in the hospital cemetery of the Johanniskirche in Leipzig. With the start of the Bach renaissance in the 19th century, the public started to become interested in his remains and their whereabouts. So, in 1894, the anatomy professor [[Wilhelm His, Sr.|Wilhelm His]] was commissioned to identify the composer\u2019s remains amongst disinterred bones from the cemetery where Bach had been buried. He concluded that \"the assumption that the bones of an elderly man, which had been found in an oak coffin near the Johanneskirche, were the remains of Johann Sebastian Bach\" (translated from German) was very likely. On 16 July 1900 the bones were placed into a stone sarcophagus underneath the Johanniskirche.\n\nFollowing the bombardment of the Johanniskirche on 4 December 1943, the bones were transferred to the Thomaskirche. The new grave with a bronze cover was inaugurated on 28 July 1950, 200 years after the death of the composer, who is now buried in the sanctuary of the Thomaskirche.\n\n===Organs===\nAnother notable feature of the Thomaskirche is that it contains two [[pipe organ|organs]]. The older one is a [[Romanticism|Romantic]] organ by [[Wilhelm Sauer]], built from 1884\u201389. Since this organ was considered \"unsuitable\" for Bach's music, a second organ was built in 1966/7 (by Alexander Schuke). This was later replaced in 1999/2000 by a new organ, built by [[Gerald Woehl]]'s organ building company from 1999\u20132000. This \"Bach organ\" was designed to look similar to the instrument on which Bach had played in the Paulinerkirche.\n\n===Church bells===\nThere are four bells in the St. Thomas bell tower. The largest is the ''Gloriosa'', which was cast by Theodericus Reinhard in 1477. It weighs 5200&nbsp;kg, has a diameter of 2.04 meters, and a strike pitch of a\u00b0. It is used on days of celebration. The second-largest bell was cast by Wolf Hilliger in 1574 and has a [[strike tone|strike note]] of c\u2032. The third largest bell is called either the Monks\u2019 or Confessional Bell (''M\u00f6nchs- oder Beichtglocke''), which has a strike pitch of d\u2032. Jakob K\u00f6nig cast it in 1634 and it serves as the hourly bell. The fourth bell was cast by Christophorus Gros in 1585 and has a strike note of f\u2033. Its resonance is dampened by shortened yokes from which it hangs. The tower lantern holds separately a bell that is rung each quarter-hour. This bell was cast in 1539 by the Schilling bell foundry in [[Apolda]]. It was modelled on its predecessor.\n\n==Choir==\nThe [[Thomanerchor]], the choir of the Thomaskirche, was founded in 1212 and is one of the oldest and most famous boys' [[choir]]s in Germany. It is headed by the [[Thomaskantor]], an office that has been held by many well-known composers and musicians, including Johann Sebastian Bach from 1723 until his death in 1750.\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery>\nImage:Leipzig-ChurchStThomas-Sauer-Organ.jpg|The Sauer organ\nImage:Leipzig-ChurchStThomas-Woehl-Organ.jpg|The Woehl organ\nFile:Vxla-thomaskirsche-exerior.jpg|Exterior of Thomaskirche\nImage:Thomaskirche leipzig pulpit.jpg|Interior with pulpit\nImage:StThomas_Leipzig_hb.JPG|Altar\nFile:Exterior of St. Thomas Church, Leipzig, with Bach statue.jpg|Exterior with Bach monument\n\nFile: Bach Window Thomaskirche.jpg|Stained-glass Bach church window (detail)\n\nFile:Vxla-jsbach-at-thomaskirsche.jpg|Statue of J.S.

The ship the Patapons and Zigotons have constructed has been finally completed and they have set sail for new lands. On their way there, they are attacked by a kraken who easily defeats them and sends the Patapons into the ocean to be washed ashore in a strange new land (which is actually and originally their homeland, the Patapolis) where they come up against another tribe called the Karmen. Now it is a battle to defeat the Karmen and find out who is their true enemy. Early in the game, the Patapons discover the mysterious \"Hero\", who wears a mask which boosts his abilities. He has lost his memory, and his true identity is forgotten, hidden and unknown. Later, the Patapons fight against the Akumapons, and the \"Dark One\" (who is actually Makoton, the Zigoton that was killed in the first game with Baban, and now was reincarnated), who gave his soul to the demons for power. Gong the Hawkeye and his fellow Zigotons appear once more, to assist the Patapons against the Karmen.\n\nDuring the course of a game, the player learns of a legend, that the world was broken and the Patapons ruined because a Wakapon broke the \"World Egg\". At the second to last stage, the player finds out that the Hero was actually the Wakapon who broke the egg, and that the Karmen tribe was the Patapon's ancestral enemy, knowing them as the ones who overtook the Patapon Ancients. The Patapon Princess was trapped inside an egg by Ormen Karmen, the leader of the Karmens, who plans to make the Princess his queen.\n\nAfter defeating the demon Dettankarmen that the Karmens summoned, the Patapons journey to the end of a bridge, only to find and break an egg. Dazzled by the bright light that emerges from the egg, the Patapons assume they have found \"IT\" at Earthend, which they have been searching since the first game. However, the Patapon Princess emerges from the egg, compliments them on their job well done, and tells the Hero that he has a new task - to restore the world and find the true Earthend.\n\nAt the end of the game, the Patapons are seen working with the Karmen and Zigotons to fix the bridge that will lead them to the other side of the land.\n\n==Characters==\nRob Smith writes that new \"characters such as the bird-riding Toripon, the Robopon with huge fists, and the magic-using Mahopon provide fresh attack types and original personalities for your almighty ruler to manage.\"<ref>Rob Smith, \"''Patapon 2: Don Chaka'': The beat goes on,\" ''PlayStation: The Official Magazine'' 13 (Holiday 2008): 20.</ref> In an interview attached to the same article, [[Hiroyuki Kotani]] adds that all \"the new characters ended up... attractive from a fundamental gameplay standpoint, so I picked the ones I liked the most.\"<ref name=\"Patapon 2 2008\">As quoted in \"''Patapon 2'': He Bangs The Drums,\" ''PlayStation: The Official Magazine'' 13 (Holiday 2008): 21.</ref>  When asked, \"From all the characters...is any one of them your personal favorite?\"  Kotani answered,\"I love Gong, the leader of the Zigotons.  In fact, I love him so much you can probably expect to see him in ''Patapon 2''.\"<ref name=\"Patapon 2 2008\"/>\n\n==Gameplay==\nThe core gameplay of Patapon 2 is almost identical to its predecessor. It is a video game that the player controls in a manner similar to rhythm games. The player is put in direct control of a tribe of Patapon warriors; to command the warriors, the player inputs specific sequences using the face buttons on the PSP, each representing a \"talking drum\", in time to a drum rhythm. These sequences order the tribe to move forward on the linear battlefield, attack, defend, and other actions. If the player inputs an unknown sequence or enters them off the main rhythm, the tribe will become confused and stop whatever they are doing. However, repeatedly entering a proper sequence in sync with the rhythm will lead the tribe into a \"Fever\" increasing their attack and defensive bonuses. The tribe will stop doing anything after performing the last entered command if the player does not enter any more commands. For example, some commands are square, square, square, circle (Pata, Pata, Pata, Pon.), which has them march forward and circle, circle, square, circle (Pon, Pon, Pata, Pon.), which makes them attack.\n\nThe game is divided into several missions. Prior to each mission, the player can recruit new troops and assemble formations, equip troops with weapons and armor gained from the spoils of war or crafted from certain minigames. The player can return to an earlier mission to acquire additional resources and equipment to build up their troops before a larger battle.\n\n===Units===\nA notable change is the inclusion of three new units for each group and another way to access new patapon classes. Another change is the evolutionary tree. To access different Patapon classes, they need to reach certain points in the tree, some not available until later parts of the game. Also Rarepon can be made without sacrificing Patapon to make space for newer ones. To maintain incentive for collecting items, there is an abundant amount of classes of Patapon to rely upon, some Patapon such as the \"Pyokoran\" Rarepon being nimble in battle as well as being immune to freezing but are vulnerable to fire damage. Another change is that a Patapon can level up by using more material with effects amplifying at every 5 level to maximum of 10.\n\nThe most notable change is the Heropon, a hero unit which can adopt the persona of any class of their choice with a powerful special attack to deliver to unsuspecting foes. You can change their masks for different stats, like elemental resistance or attack speed. They also can be revived but takes longer to revive with each death. In addition, if Hatapon is alone while the Heropon is reviving, the mission ends. Each \"Hero\" persona also has a special move that can only be activated in Fever mode and must have perfect beat. This special ability shows a spirit above him and allows him to have a special damage effect on opponents like: The Iron Fist (Yaripon), Broken Arrow (Yumipon).\n\n===Multiplayer===\n''Patapon'' designer Hiroyuki Kotani has revealed that the multiplayer mode stems from the single-player mode, the former of which will involve giant eggs. These eggs contain Masks for the Hero Patapon to wear, or new CPU Kumopons. To hatch the eggs, four players must defend the egg on an enemy-laden multiplayer battleground, while moving it to a special egg-hatching altar. At this altar, all players must perform a hatching ceremony, which involves playing their rhythms in synchronization to crack the egg.<ref>[http://www.1up.com/do/newsStory?cId=3168612 Information on Patapon 2 Multi]</ref>\n\n==''Patapon 2: Art of War''==\n''Patapon 2: Art of War'' is a flash game created by Rolito and Interlink to promote ''Patapon 2''.

Upon seeing one of his possible futures dying old with Jessica, Morty begins taking whatever action would lead to that future, resulting in him inadvertently killing Rick. Holographic Rick then appears and instructs Morty to collect Rick's DNA so he can be cloned and resurrected. Seeing that following Holographic Rick's instructions won't give him the future he wants, Morty refuses to clone Rick. Meanwhile, Rick's consciousness is routed into clones of alternate universe Ricks. All of the alternate Ricks end up being fascist and hostile except for Wasp Rick, who agrees to help. Morty meanwhile causes chaos as he kills numerous people and uses special ferro-fluid to turn himself into a cyborg abomination to pursue his desired future. Rick, Wasp Rick, and Holographic Rick team up to turn Morty back to normal. The ferro-fluid then bonds with Holographic Rick, causing him to become hostile and forcing Wasp Rick to kill him.

While Rick is gone, Jerry disobeys his explicit instructions and asks Rick's new intern Glootie to develop an app for him. Glootie develops a matchmaking app that Jerry names \"Lovefinderrz\", whose advice its users, including Summer, impulsively follow as the app constantly changes who they should be matched with. Beth attempts to block Summer's relationships due to her still being underage. Morty forces Glootie to take him and Jerry to his mothership, where it is revealed Glootie's species plans to use the app to distract humanity while they invade Earth for its water. Jerry convinces Glootie to help by showing him that they both are considered incompatible to anybody by the app, and Glootie sabotages the app by implementing an ad wall. Meanwhile, Rick finds out someone else used his toilet and tracks down an alien businessman named Tony, who admits his guilt and points out they are both private poopers since pooping is the only amount of control they feel they have in their lives. Despite many threats, Rick never follows through with killing Tony, and when he dies in an accident, Rick provides Tony's father with a means to clone him. It's then revealed that Rick prepared an elaborate holographic routine that would have insulted Tony the next time he used his toilet. \n----\n''Post-credit scene'': Jerry ingests a fluid developed by Rick to show its user their deepest desire.

Rick then assembles a crew to gain entry into HeistCon to confront Miles. They agree to a bet to see who can steal the Crystal Skull of Horowitz first. Miles then reveals he already stole the Crystal Skull by recruiting Rick's team, but Rick reveals with the help of Heist-o-Tron, he predicted Miles' plan and hypnotized his team to steal the Crystal Skull for him instead. He then orders the HeistCon crowd, who have also been hypnotized by Heist-o-Tron, to steal HeistCon, which results in Miles' death. Heist-o-Tron then goes rogue and begins stealing planets, forcing Rick to organize a second team which includes Mr. Poopybutthole. To counter Heist-o-Tron, Rick builds Rand-o-Tron, whose random instructions help the team track down Heist-o-Tron. Rick and Heist-o-Tron then get into an argument over whose plan is superior before Heist-o-Tron realizes the perfect heist is the one that will never be written and self destructs.

The cat convinces Jerry to take it to Florida to find fun at beach party, but the cat betrays Jerry by accusing him of defecating on the beach. However, the cat only ends up annoying everybody at the party, resulting in it getting kicked out along with Jerry. Morty tries to play with Balthromaw, but it is clear Balthromaw doesn't like Morty, which frustrates him. Angered at Balthromaw stealing Morty's attention, Rick tries to kill the dragon, but they both end up realizing they have much in common and inadvertently soul bond. The Wizard then arrives, accuses Balthromaw of being a \"slut dragon\", and takes him away to be executed. Rick helps Morty rescue Balthromaw, since the soul bond means he will die if Balthromaw does. With the help of other slut dragons, Rick and Morty are able to rescue Balthromaw, kill the Wizard, and break the soul bond.

While traveling through space, Rick's spaceship gets a \"flat tire\", which requires Rick to stop to repair it. Morty disobeys Rick's order to stay in the spaceship, and is bitten by a space snake. As Rick analyzes the snake for an antidote, he and Morty learn that it is in fact an astronaut from a planet of intelligent snakes that are on the brink of a world war. Feeling guilty, Morty secretly replaces the dead snake astronaut with a regular snake and drops it off at the snake planet. The alien snakes soon realize Morty's snake is not native to their planet. Later, time-traveling robot snakes arrive at Morty's house to try to protect and kill him. With help from a future version of himself, Rick travels back in time and leaves the secrets of time travel to the snakes earlier in their timeline, which eventually results in them abusing time travel enough to attract the attention of the Time Police, who destroy their civilization by eliminating their first intelligent ancestor. Jerry manages to make his way back home but ends up injuring himself like Rick predicted.

Upon seeing one of his possible futures dying old with Jessica, Morty begins taking whatever action would lead to that future, resulting in him inadvertently killing Rick. Holographic Rick then appears and instructs Morty to collect Rick's DNA so he can be cloned and resurrected. Seeing that following Holographic Rick's instructions won't give him the future he wants, Morty refuses to clone Rick. Meanwhile, Rick's consciousness is routed into clones of alternate universe Ricks. All of the alternate Ricks end up being fascist and hostile except for Wasp Rick, who agrees to help. Morty meanwhile causes chaos as he kills numerous people and uses special ferro-fluid to turn himself into a cyborg abomination to pursue his desired future. Rick, Wasp Rick, and Holographic Rick team up to turn Morty back to normal. The ferro-fluid then bonds with Holographic Rick, causing him to become hostile and forcing Wasp Rick to kill him. Jerry and Beth are angry at Rick, but Morty takes responsibility for the damage he caused. Rick and Morty agree to share responsibility in future adventures.\n----\n''Post-credit scene'': Morty overhears Jessica telling her friends that she plans to become a hospice worker to care for the elderly in their dying moments, causing him to become angry that the future the crystal showed him was misleading. \n| LineColor       = 000900\n}}\n{{Episode list/sublist|Rick and Morty (season 4)\n | EpisodeNumber   = 33\n | EpisodeNumber2  = 2\n | Title           = [[The Old Man and the Seat]]\n | DirectedBy      = Jacob Hair\n | WrittenBy       = Michael Waldron\n | OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2019|11|17}}\n | Viewers         = 1.67<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.showbuzzdaily.com/articles/showbuzzdailys-top-150-sunday-cable-originals-network-finals-11-17-2019.html|title=Top 150 Sunday Cable Originals & Network Finals: 11.17.2019|work=Showbuzz Daily|author=Mitch Metcalf|date=November 19, 2019|access-date=November 19, 2019}}</ref>\n | ShortSummary    = Rick leaves the house for his personal toilet since he is a private pooper. While Rick is gone, Jerry disobeys his explicit instructions and asks Rick's new intern Glootie to develop an app for him. Glootie develops a matchmaking app that Jerry names \"Lovefinderrz\", whose advice its users, including Summer, impulsively follow as the app constantly changes who they should be matched with. Beth attempts to block Summer's relationships due to her still being underage. Morty forces Glootie to take him and Jerry to his mothership, where it is revealed Glootie's species plans to use the app to distract humanity while they invade Earth for its water. Jerry convinces Glootie to help by showing him that they both are considered incompatible to anybody by the app, and Glootie sabotages the app by implementing an ad wall. Meanwhile, Rick finds out someone else used his toilet and tracks down an alien businessman named Tony, who admits his guilt and points out they are both private poopers since pooping is the only amount of control they feel they have in their lives. Despite many threats, Rick never follows through with killing Tony, and when he dies in an accident, Rick provides Tony's father with a means to clone him. It's then revealed that Rick prepared an elaborate holographic routine that would have insulted Tony the next time he used his toilet. \n----\n''Post-credit scene'': Jerry ingests a fluid developed by Rick to show its user their deepest desire.

Rick then assembles a crew to gain entry into HeistCon to confront Miles. They agree to a bet to see who can steal the Crystal Skull of Horowitz first. Miles then reveals he already stole the Crystal Skull by recruiting Rick's team, but Rick reveals with the help of Heist-o-Tron, he predicted Miles' plan and hypnotized his team to steal the Crystal Skull for him instead. He then orders the HeistCon crowd, who have also been hypnotized by Heist-o-Tron, to steal HeistCon, which results in Miles' death. Heist-o-Tron then goes rogue and begins stealing planets, forcing Rick to organize a second team which includes Mr. Poopybutthole. To counter Heist-o-Tron, Rick builds Rand-o-Tron, whose random instructions help the team track down Heist-o-Tron. Rick and Heist-o-Tron then get into an argument over whose plan is superior before Heist-o-Tron realizes the perfect heist is the one that will never be written and self destructs. Morty then goes to Netflix to submit his heist screenplay but loses motivation when he realizes how formulaic his screenplay is. It is then revealed that Rick orchestrated the entire heist adventure to sour Morty on heists so that he won't join Netflix and continue adventuring with Rick instead.  \n----\n''Post-credit scene'': Rick has a beer with Mr. Poopybutthole on the roof, where he admits he paid Mr. Poopybutthole's students to attack him to test his karate skills.

Meanwhile, Jerry encounters a talking cat in his bedroom, but Rick insists he has nothing to do with it. The cat convinces Jerry to take it to Florida to find fun at beach party, but the cat betrays Jerry by accusing him of defecating on the beach. However, the cat only ends up annoying everybody at the party, resulting in it getting kicked out along with Jerry. Morty tries to play with Balthromaw, but it is clear Balthromaw doesn't like Morty, which frustrates him. Angered at Balthromaw stealing Morty's attention, Rick tries to kill the dragon, but they both end up realizing they have much in common and inadvertently soul bond. The Wizard then arrives, accuses Balthromaw of being a \"slut dragon\", and takes him away to be executed. Rick helps Morty rescue Balthromaw, since the soul bond means he will die if Balthromaw does. With the help of other slut dragons, Rick and Morty are able to rescue Balthromaw, kill the Wizard, and break the soul bond. Now uncomfortable with how sexual dragons are, Rick and Morty part ways with Balthromaw. Rick and Jerry scan the cat's mind to figure out why it can talk, and are horrified at what they see. They chase the cat away and Rick erases Jerry's memory of the incident. \n----\n''Post-credit scene'': The talking cat crosses paths with Balthromaw, and asks him if he can fly him to Florida. \n | LineColor       = 000900\n}}\n{{Episode list/sublist|Rick and Morty (season 4)\n | EpisodeNumber   = 36\n | EpisodeNumber2  = 5\n | Title           = [[Rattlestar Ricklactica]]\n | DirectedBy      = Jacob Hair\n | WrittenBy       = James Siciliano\n | OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2019|12|15}}\n | Viewers         = 1.32<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.showbuzzdaily.com/articles/showbuzzdailys-top-150-sunday-cable-originals-network-finals-12-15-2019.html|title=Top 150 Sunday Cable Originals & Network Finals: 12.15.2019|work=Showbuzz Daily|author=Mitch Metcalf|date=December 17, 2019|access-date=December 17, 2019}}</ref>\n| ShortSummary    = In order to keep Jerry from hurting himself while putting up Christmas lights, Rick makes him lighter than air, but Jerry later loses his shoe which causes him to float away and get lost. While traveling through space, Rick's spaceship gets a \"flat tire\", which requires Rick to stop to repair it. Morty disobeys Rick's order to stay in the spaceship, and is bitten by a space snake. As Rick analyzes the snake for an antidote, he and Morty learn that it is in fact an astronaut from a planet of intelligent snakes that are on the brink of a world war. Feeling guilty, Morty secretly replaces the dead snake astronaut with a regular snake and drops it off at the snake planet. The alien snakes soon realize Morty's snake is not native to their planet. Later, time-traveling robot snakes arrive at Morty's house to try to protect and kill him. With help from a future version of himself, Rick travels back in time and leaves the secrets of time travel to the snakes earlier in their timeline, which eventually results in them abusing time travel enough to attract the attention of the Time Police, who destroy their civilization by eliminating their first intelligent ancestor. Jerry manages to make his way back home but ends up injuring himself like Rick predicted. Rick and Morty then meet their future selves, who remind them they need to help their past selves solve the snake problem and close the time loop.\n----\n''Post-credit scene'': Rick and Morty finish preparing the items they need to give to their past selves.

The title is created from two Japanese onomatopoeia, pata (marching) and pon (drumming). The game is presented in a cartoonish, [[silhouette]]d two-[[dimension]]al environment, and features the player acting as a [[deity]] who commands an army of caricatured miniature tribal creatures by beating traditional [[talking drums]]. The game was developed by Pyramid and produced by Japan Studios.<ref name=\"sonyblog_patapon\" />\n\n==Gameplay==\n''Patapon'' is a video game that the player controls in a manner similar to [[music video game|rhythm games]]. The player is put in direct control of a [[tribe]] of Patapon warriors; to command the warriors, the player inputs specific sequences using the face buttons on the PSP, each representing a \"talking drum\", in time to a drum rhythm. These sequences order the tribe to move forward on the linear battlefield, attack, defend, and other actions. If the player inputs an unknown sequence or enters them off the main rhythm, the tribe will become confused and stop whatever they are doing. However, repeatedly entering a proper sequence in sync with the rhythm will lead the tribe into a \"Fever\" increasing their attack and defensive bonuses. The tribe will stop doing anything after performing the last entered command if the player does not enter any more commands. For example, some commands are square, square, square, circle (Pata, Pata, Pata, Pon.), which has them march forward and circle, circle, square, circle (Pon, Pon, Pata, Pon.), which makes them attack.\n\nThe game is divided into several missions. Prior to each mission, the player can recruit new troops and assemble formations, equip troops with weapons and armor gained from the [[War looting|spoils of war]] or crafted from certain minigames. The player can return to an earlier mission to acquire additional resources and equipment to build up their troops before a larger battle.\n\n==Story==\nThe Patapon Tribe were flourishing people until they experienced many tragic losses and later on, they were maltreated by the Zigoton Empire (although Ormen Karmen of the Karmen Tribe originally defeated them and overtook the Patapole Palace). The player takes the role of their god, the \"Almighty\", and uses sacred war drums (Pata, Pon, Chaka, Don) to direct the Patapons to recover their land. As the story progresses, the Patapons embark on a journey to Earthend to look upon \"IT\", a sacred object whose appearance is unknown to the tribe and whose purpose is to grant the Patapons eternal contentment and true happiness. The enemy of the Patapons is the evil Zigoton Empire, a powerful tribe of slightly squarish creatures with red-and-black eyes (as opposed to the white-and-black-eyed Patapons) that have oppressed the Patapons since their fall from power. It becomes apparent later in the game that the Zigotons have their own prophecy which foretells that when the Patapons finally see and gaze at \"IT\", the world will fall into chaos. Towards the end of the game, many of the main Zigoton warriors sell their souls to the dark forces in an attempt to gain more power. Eventually Queen Kharma, ruler of the Zigotons, sells her soul in a final attempt to destroy the Patapons. When she is defeated, the Patapons have to kill Gorl, the demon that once threatened the world. Once defeated, the 3 Yaripons from the beginning arrive at the coast, which they assumed to be Earthend, and see the rising sun, which they assume to be \"IT\". However, unfulfilled by the anticlimactic end of their journey, they come to the conclusion that \"IT\" is, in fact, not the sun and to realize their destiny, they must cross the ocean to the real Earthend and continue their quest. At the end of the game, there is a scene in which the Patapons and the Zigotons are working together to build a boat to cross the sea.\n\n==Playable demo==\nOn January 25, [[2008 in video gaming|2008]]. a playable demo was announced by Patapon's associate producer Chris Hinojosa-Miranda via the official PlayStation blog.

The title is created from two Japanese onomatopoeia, pata (marching) and pon (drumming). The game is presented in a cartoonish, [[silhouette]]d two-[[dimension]]al environment, and features the player acting as a [[deity]] who commands an army of caricatured miniature tribal creatures by beating traditional [[talking drums]]. The game was developed by Pyramid and produced by Japan Studios.<ref name=\"sonyblog_patapon\" />\n\n==Gameplay==\n''Patapon'' is a video game that the player controls in a manner similar to [[music video game|rhythm games]]. The player is put in direct control of a [[tribe]] of Patapon warriors; to command the warriors, the player inputs specific sequences using the face buttons on the PSP, each representing a \"talking drum\", in time to a drum rhythm. These sequences order the tribe to move forward on the linear battlefield, attack, defend, and other actions. If the player inputs an unknown sequence or enters them off the main rhythm, the tribe will become confused and stop whatever they are doing. However, repeatedly entering a proper sequence in sync with the rhythm will lead the tribe into a \"Fever\" increasing their attack and defensive bonuses. The tribe will stop doing anything after performing the last entered command if the player does not enter any more commands. For example, some commands are square, square, square, circle (Pata, Pata, Pata, Pon.), which has them march forward and circle, circle, square, circle (Pon, Pon, Pata, Pon.), which makes them attack.\n\nThe game is divided into several missions. Prior to each mission, the player can recruit new troops and assemble formations, equip troops with weapons and armor gained from the [[War looting|spoils of war]] or crafted from certain minigames. The player can return to an earlier mission to acquire additional resources and equipment to build up their troops before a larger battle.\n\n==Story==\nThe Patapon Tribe were flourishing people until they experienced many tragic losses and later on, they were maltreated by the Zigoton Empire (although Ormen Karmen of the Karmen Tribe originally defeated them and overtook the Patapole Palace). The player takes the role of their god, the \"Almighty\", and uses sacred war drums (Pata, Pon, Chaka, Don) to direct the Patapons to recover their land. As the story progresses, the Patapons embark on a journey to Earthend to look upon \"IT\", a sacred object whose appearance is unknown to the tribe and whose purpose is to grant the Patapons eternal contentment and true happiness. The enemy of the Patapons is the evil Zigoton Empire, a powerful tribe of slightly squarish creatures with red-and-black eyes (as opposed to the white-and-black-eyed Patapons) that have oppressed the Patapons since their fall from power. It becomes apparent later in the game that the Zigotons have their own prophecy which foretells that when the Patapons finally see and gaze at \"IT\", the world will fall into chaos. Towards the end of the game, many of the main Zigoton warriors sell their souls to the dark forces in an attempt to gain more power. Eventually Queen Kharma, ruler of the Zigotons, sells her soul in a final attempt to destroy the Patapons. When she is defeated, the Patapons have to kill Gorl, the demon that once threatened the world. Once defeated, the 3 Yaripons from the beginning arrive at the coast, which they assumed to be Earthend, and see the rising sun, which they assume to be \"IT\". However, unfulfilled by the anticlimactic end of their journey, they come to the conclusion that \"IT\" is, in fact, not the sun and to realize their destiny, they must cross the ocean to the real Earthend and continue their quest. At the end of the game, there is a scene in which the Patapons and the Zigotons are working together to build a boat to cross the sea.\n\n==Playable demo==\nOn January 25, [[2008 in video gaming|2008]]. a playable demo was announced by Patapon's associate producer Chris Hinojosa-Miranda via the official PlayStation blog. He revealed that the demo would be available for those who pre-ordered a copy of ''Patapon'' through GameStop.

The group stars in the television series ''[[Impractical Jokers]]'', which premiered on December 15, 2011. The program airs on [[truTV]] in the U.S. and on [[Comedy Central]] in the UK, Ireland, and India.\n\n==Origin==\nThe comedians met in religion class during freshman year at [[Monsignor Farrell High School]] on [[Staten Island]] in 1990. They became interested in drama and improv and joined an improv club because \"it was the only way to meet girls\", as their private high school was only for boys.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.greenbaypressgazette.com/story/entertainment/television/2016/06/09/murr-impractical-jokers-jokes-us/85351692/|title=Murr of 'Impractical Jokers': 'The joke's on us'|work=Green Bay Press-Gazette|date=June 9, 2016|accessdate=July 21, 2016|first= Kendra |last= Meinert}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://nypost.com/2013/12/16/staten-island-quartet-takes-pranks-to-impractical-heights/|title=Staten Island quartet takes pranks to 'Impractical' heights|work=New York Post|date=December 16, 2013|accessdate=July 21, 2016|first= Andrea |last= Morabito}}</ref> Sal Vulcano kept a list of words that they felt embarrassed to say in a public setting. When searching for a name for their comedy troupe, Sal's list, which included \"culottes\", \"gargoyle\", and \"nougat\", was used. The group eventually chose \"The Tenderloins\".\n\n==Career==\n\n===Stage===\nAfter finishing college, James Murray worked for the Staten Island Ferry where he ran into his friend Sal. They reminisced about their enjoyment doing improv. After reuniting with Joe and another friend, Mike Boccio, they practiced improv at Joe's house three days a week, for six months. The Tenderloins began in 1999 as a live [[improv comedy]] and [[sketch comedy]] troupe.\n\nThe troupe briefly consisted of five members. However, Gideon Horowitz soon left the group for personal reasons. After the success of ''Impractical Jokers'', the Tenderloins have also taken part in several American and international tours. They have performed in New York, Los Angeles, and Chicago, and participated in the San Francisco Sketch Comedy Festival and the Miami Improv Festival.{{Citation needed|date=December 2012}}\n\n===Internet success===\nIn 2006, following years of live shows, the Tenderloins redirected their talents to filmed comedic sketches. Brian Quinn subsequently replaced Mike Boccio as the troupe's fourth member.\n\nThe Tenderloins' comedic sketches have accumulated millions of views on [[YouTube]], [[MySpace]], [[Metacafe]], and other websites. In 2007, the troupe won the $100,000 grand prize in the [[NBC]] ''It's Your Show'' competition for the sketch \"Time Thugs\".\n\n===Television===\nFollowing the troupe's online successes, the four were signed to develop a scripted comedy pilot for [[Spike (TV channel)|Spike TV]] based on their own lives. The pilot was shot on location in 2008 on [[Staten Island]], as well as at other locations around [[New York City]]. Spike TV ultimately passed on the series. A second pilot starring the Tenderloins was officially selected for the 2009 New York Television Festival.\n\nOn April 12, 2011, truTV announced a new series to star the Tenderloins. ''[[Impractical Jokers]]'' premiered on December 15, 2011, executive-produced by the troupe themselves. Season 1 consisted of 16 episodes. The first season was watched by over 32 million viewers.\n\nThe show's second season premiered on December 13, 2012 and consisted of 28 episodes.

The group stars in the television series ''[[Impractical Jokers]]'', which premiered on December 15, 2011. The program airs on [[truTV]] in the U.S. and on [[Comedy Central]] in the UK, Ireland, and India.\n\n==Origin==\nThe comedians met in religion class during freshman year at [[Monsignor Farrell High School]] on [[Staten Island]] in 1990. They became interested in drama and improv and joined an improv club because \"it was the only way to meet girls\", as their private high school was only for boys.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.greenbaypressgazette.com/story/entertainment/television/2016/06/09/murr-impractical-jokers-jokes-us/85351692/|title=Murr of 'Impractical Jokers': 'The joke's on us'|work=Green Bay Press-Gazette|date=June 9, 2016|accessdate=July 21, 2016|first= Kendra |last= Meinert}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://nypost.com/2013/12/16/staten-island-quartet-takes-pranks-to-impractical-heights/|title=Staten Island quartet takes pranks to 'Impractical' heights|work=New York Post|date=December 16, 2013|accessdate=July 21, 2016|first= Andrea |last= Morabito}}</ref> Sal Vulcano kept a list of words that they felt embarrassed to say in a public setting. When searching for a name for their comedy troupe, Sal's list, which included \"culottes\", \"gargoyle\", and \"nougat\", was used. The group eventually chose \"The Tenderloins\".\n\n==Career==\n\n===Stage===\nAfter finishing college, James Murray worked for the Staten Island Ferry where he ran into his friend Sal. They reminisced about their enjoyment doing improv. After reuniting with Joe and another friend, Mike Boccio, they practiced improv at Joe's house three days a week, for six months. The Tenderloins began in 1999 as a live [[improv comedy]] and [[sketch comedy]] troupe.\n\nThe troupe briefly consisted of five members. However, Gideon Horowitz soon left the group for personal reasons. After the success of ''Impractical Jokers'', the Tenderloins have also taken part in several American and international tours. They have performed in New York, Los Angeles, and Chicago, and participated in the San Francisco Sketch Comedy Festival and the Miami Improv Festival.{{Citation needed|date=December 2012}}\n\n===Internet success===\nIn 2006, following years of live shows, the Tenderloins redirected their talents to filmed comedic sketches. Brian Quinn subsequently replaced Mike Boccio as the troupe's fourth member.\n\nThe Tenderloins' comedic sketches have accumulated millions of views on [[YouTube]], [[MySpace]], [[Metacafe]], and other websites. In 2007, the troupe won the $100,000 grand prize in the [[NBC]] ''It's Your Show'' competition for the sketch \"Time Thugs\".\n\n===Television===\nFollowing the troupe's online successes, the four were signed to develop a scripted comedy pilot for [[Spike (TV channel)|Spike TV]] based on their own lives. The pilot was shot on location in 2008 on [[Staten Island]], as well as at other locations around [[New York City]]. Spike TV ultimately passed on the series. A second pilot starring the Tenderloins was officially selected for the 2009 New York Television Festival.\n\nOn April 12, 2011, truTV announced a new series to star the Tenderloins. ''[[Impractical Jokers]]'' premiered on December 15, 2011, executive-produced by the troupe themselves. Season 1 consisted of 16 episodes. The first season was watched by over 32 million viewers.\n\nThe show's second season premiered on December 13, 2012 and consisted of 28 episodes.

It may be used at home or in a nursing or rehabilitation institution if patients have chronic illnesses that require long-term ventilatory assistance.  Due to the anatomy of the human [[pharynx]], [[larynx]], and [[esophagus]] and the circumstances for which ventilation is needed, additional measures are often required to secure the [[Artificial airway|airway]] during positive-pressure ventilation in order to allow unimpeded passage of air into the trachea and avoid air passing into the esophagus and stomach. The common method is by [[Artificial airway|insertion of a tube into the trachea]]: intubation, which provides a clear route for the air. This can be either an [[tracheal tube|endotracheal tube]], inserted through the natural openings of mouth or nose, or a [[tracheostomy]] inserted through an artificial opening in the neck. In other circumstances simple [[Airway management#Airway maneuvers|airway maneuvres]], an [[oropharyngeal airway]] or [[laryngeal mask airway]] may be employed. If the patient is able to protect his/her own airway and [[non-invasive ventilation]] or [[Negative pressure ventilator|negative-pressure ventilation]] is used then an [[Artificial airway|airway adjunct]] may not be needed.{{citation needed|date=March 2016}}\n\n===Negative pressure machines===\n[[Image:Poumon artificiel.jpg|thumb|An iron lung]]\n{{main|Negative pressure ventilator}}\nThe [[Negative pressure ventilator|iron lung]], also known as the Drinker and Shaw tank, was developed in 1929 and was one of the first negative-pressure machines used for long-term ventilation. It was refined and used in the 20th century largely as a result of the [[polio]] [[epidemic]] that struck the world in the 1940s. The machine is, in effect, a large elongated [[tank]], which encases the patient up to the neck. The neck is sealed with a rubber [[gasket]] so that the patient's face (and airway) are exposed to the room air.{{citation needed|date=March 2016}}\n\nWhile the exchange of [[oxygen]] and [[carbon dioxide]] between the bloodstream and the pulmonary airspace works by [[diffusion]] and requires no external work, air must be moved into and out of the [[human lung|lungs]] to make it available to the [[gas exchange]] process. In spontaneous breathing, a negative pressure is created in the [[pleural cavity]] by the muscles of respiration, and the resulting gradient between the [[atmospheric pressure]] and the pressure inside the [[human thorax|thorax]] generates a flow of air.\n\nIn the iron lung by means of a pump, the air is withdrawn mechanically to produce a vacuum inside the tank, thus creating negative pressure. This negative pressure leads to expansion of the chest, which causes a decrease in intrapulmonary pressure, and increases flow of ambient air into the lungs. As the vacuum is released, the pressure inside the tank equalizes to that of the ambient pressure, and the elastic coil of the chest and lungs leads to passive exhalation. However, when the vacuum is created, the abdomen also expands along with the lung, cutting off venous flow back to the heart, leading to pooling of venous blood in the lower extremities. There are large portholes for nurse or home assistant access. The patients can talk and eat normally, and can see the world through a well-placed series of mirrors. Some could remain in these iron lungs for years at a time quite successfully.{{citation needed|date=March 2016}}\n\nToday, negative pressure mechanical ventilators are still in use, notably with the polio wing hospitals in [[England]] such as [[St Thomas' Hospital]] in London and the [[John Radcliffe Hospital|John Radcliffe]] in [[Oxford]]. The prominent device used is a smaller device known as the [[cuirass]]. The cuirass is a shell-like unit, creating negative pressure only to the chest using a combination of a fitting shell and a soft bladder. Its main use is in patients with neuromuscular disorders that have some residual muscular function. However, it was prone to falling off and caused severe chafing and skin damage and was not used as a long-term device. In recent years this device has re-surfaced as a modern [[polycarbonate]] shell with multiple seals and a high-pressure [[oscillation pump]] in order to carry out [[biphasic cuirass ventilation]].\n\n=== Positive pressure ===\n{{main|Ventilator}}\n{{See also|COVID\u201319 related shortages}}\n[[File:Commonly used intensive care ventilators.png|thumb|Examples of commonly used modern intensive care ventilators: A.

Covidien PB840. ]]\n[[Image:VIP Bird2.jpg|thumb|Neonatal mechanical ventilator]]\nThe design of the modern positive-pressure ventilators were based mainly on technical developments by the military during World War II to supply oxygen to fighter pilots in high altitude. Such ventilators replaced the iron lungs as safe endotracheal tubes with high-volume/low-pressure cuffs were developed. The popularity of positive-pressure ventilators rose during the polio epidemic in the 1950s in Scandinavia and the United States and was the beginning of [[modern ventilation therapy]]. Positive pressure through manual supply of 50% oxygen through a [[tracheostomy]] tube led to a reduced mortality rate among patients with polio and respiratory paralysis. However, because of the sheer amount of man-power required for such manual intervention, mechanical positive-pressure ventilators became increasingly popular.{{citation needed|date=March 2016}}\n\nPositive-pressure ventilators work by increasing the patient's airway pressure through an endotracheal or tracheostomy tube. The positive pressure allows air to flow into the airway until the ventilator breath is terminated. Then, the airway pressure drops to zero, and the elastic recoil of the chest wall and lungs push the [[tidal volume]] \u2014 the breath-out through passive exhalation.\n\n==== Transairway pressure ====\n:::<math> P_\\text{TA} = P_\\text{AO} - P_\\text{ALV}</math>\n* ''P''<sub>TA</sub> = Transairway pressure\n* ''P''<sub>AO</sub> = Pressure at airway opening\n* ''P''<sub>ALV</sub> = Pressure in alveoli\n\n=== Intermittent abdominal pressure ventilator ===\nAnother type is the ''intermittent abdominal pressure ventilator'' that applies pressure externally via an inflated bladder, forcing exhalation, sometimes termed [[exsufflation]].

Mechanical ventilators are ventilators not requiring operator effort and are typically computer-controlled or pneumatic-controlled.\n\n=== Mechanical ventilators ===\nMechanical ventilators typically require power by a battery or a wall outlet (DC or AC) though some ventilators work on a pneumatic system not requiring power.\n* '''Transport ventilators''' \u2014 These ventilators are small and more rugged, and can be powered pneumatically or via AC or DC power sources.\n* '''Intensive-care ventilators''' \u2014 These ventilators are larger and usually run on AC power (though virtually all contain a battery to facilitate intra-facility transport and as a back-up in the event of a power failure).  This style of ventilator often provides greater control of a wide variety of ventilation parameters (such as inspiratory rise time).  Many ICU ventilators also incorporate graphics to provide visual feedback of each breath.\n* '''Neonatal ventilators''' ([[Bubble CPAP]]) \u2014 Designed with the preterm neonate in mind, these are a specialized subset of ICU ventilators that are designed to deliver the smaller, more precise volumes and pressures required to ventilate these patients.\n* '''[[Positive airway pressure]] ventilators''' ('''PAP''') \u2014 These ventilators are specifically designed for [[non-invasive ventilation]].  This includes ventilators for use at home for treatment of chronic conditions such as [[sleep apnea]] or [[COPD]].\n\n== Breath delivery ==\n{{unsourced|section|date=March 2020}}\n=== Trigger ===\nThe trigger is what causes a breath to be delivered by a mechanical ventilator.  Breaths may be triggered by a patient taking their own breath, a ventilator operator pressing a manual breath button, or by the ventilator based on the set breath rate and mode of ventilation.\n\n=== Cycle ===\nThe cycle is what causes the breath to transition from the inspiratory phase to the exhalation phase.  Breaths may be cycled by a mechanical ventilator when a set time has been reached, or when a preset flow or percentage of the maximum flow delivered during a breath is reached depending on the breath type and the settings. Breaths can also be cycled when an alarm condition such as a high pressure limit has been reached, which is a primary strategy in [[pressure regulated volume control]].\n\n=== Limit ===\nLimit is how the breath is controlled. Breaths may be limited to a set maximum circuit\npressure or a set maximum flow.\n\n== Breath exhalation ==\nExhalation in mechanical ventilation is almost always completely passive. The ventilator's expiratory valve is opened, and expiratory flow is allowed until the baseline pressure ([[PEEP]]) is reached. Expiratory flow is determined by patient factors such as compliance and resistance.\n\n== Dead space ==\nMechanical dead space is defined as the volume of gas breathed again as the result of use in a mechanical device.{{citation needed|date=March 2016}}\n\n;Example of calculation for mechanical dead space \n<math chem> V_{Dmech} = V_T - V_{Dphys} - \\frac{Pa\\ce{CO2}(V_T - V_D - V_{Dmech})}{P_{A\\ce{CO2}}}</math>\n\n;Simplified version\n<math chem> \\frac{V_D}{V_T} = \\frac{Pa\\ce{CO2} - P\\bar{E}\\ce{CO2}}{Pa\\ce{CO2}}</math>\n\n== Modes of ventilation ==\n{{Main|Modes of mechanical ventilation}}\nMechanical ventilation utilizes several separate systems for ventilation referred to as the mode.  Modes come in many different delivery concepts but all modes fall into one of three categories;  volume-cycled, pressure-cycled, spontaneously cycled.  In general, the selection of which mode of mechanical ventilation to use for a given patient is based on the familiarity of [[clinician]]s with modes and the equipment availability at a particular institution.<ref name=\"pmid10806138\">{{cite journal |vauthors=Esteban A, Anzueto A, Al\u00eda I, Gordo F, Apeztegu\u00eda C, P\u00e1lizas F, etal | title=How is mechanical ventilation employed in the intensive care unit?

The estimated shunt fraction refers to the amount of oxygen not being absorbed into the circulation. In normal physiology, gas exchange (oxygen/carbon dioxide) occurs at the level of the [[Pulmonary alveolus|alveoli]] in the lungs. The existence of a shunt refers to any process that hinders this gas exchange, leading to wasted oxygen inspired and the flow of un-oxygenated blood back to the left heart (which ultimately supplies the rest of the body with unoxygenated blood).\n\nWhen using 100% O2 (''Fi''{{chem|O|2}} 1.00), the degree of shunting is estimated by subtracting the measured ''Pa''{{chem|O|2}} (from an [[arterial blood gas]]) from 700 mmHg. For each difference of 100 mmHg, the shunt is 5%. A shunt of more than 25% should prompt a search for the cause of this hypoxemia, such as mainstem intubation or [[pneumothorax]], and should be treated accordingly. If such complications are not present, other causes must be sought after, and [[positive end-expiratory pressure]] (PEEP) should be used to treat this intrapulmonary shunt. Other such causes of a shunt include:\n* Alveolar collapse from major [[atelectasis]]\n* Alveolar collection of material other than gas, such as pus from [[pneumonia]], water and protein from [[acute respiratory distress syndrome]], water from [[congestive heart failure]], or blood from haemorrhage{{citation needed|date=March 2016}}\n\n=== Weaning from mechanical ventilation ===\nTiming of withdrawal from mechanical ventilation\u2014also known as weaning\u2014should be carefully considered. Patients should have their ventilation considered for withdrawal if they are able to support their own ventilation and oxygenation, and this should be assessed continuously. There are several objective parameters to look for when considering withdrawal, but there are no specific criteria that generalizes to all patients.\n\nThe [[Rapid Shallow Breathing Index]] (RSBI, the ratio of respiratory frequency to tidal volume (f/VT), previously referred to as the \"Tobin Index\" after Dr. Martin Tobin of [[Loyola University Medical Center]]) is one of the best studied and most commonly used weaning predictors, with no other predictor having been shown to be superior. It was described in a prospective cohort study of mechanically ventilated patients which found that a RSBI > 105 breaths/min/L was associated with weaning failure, while a RSBI < 105 breaths/min/L predicted weaning success with a sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value and negative predictive value of 97%, 64%, 78%, 95% respectively.<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Yang KL, Tobin MJ |title=A prospective study of indexes predicting the outcome of trials of weaning from mechanical ventilation |journal=N.

In patients who have diffused loss of aeration, PEEP can be used provided it does not cause the plateau pressure to rise above the upper inflection point.\n\nMost modern ventilators have basic monitoring tools. There are also monitors that work independently of the ventilator which allow for measuring patients after the ventilator has been removed, such as a [[tracheal tube |T tube test]].\n\n==Artificial airways as a connection to the ventilator==\n{{Main|Artificial airway}}\nThere are various procedures and mechanical devices that provide protection against airway collapse, air leakage, and [[Pulmonary aspiration|aspiration]]:\n* [[Respirator|Face mask]] \u2014 In resuscitation and for minor procedures under anaesthesia, a face mask is often sufficient to achieve a seal against air leakage. Airway patency of the unconscious patient is maintained either by manipulation of the jaw or by the use of ''nasopharyngeal'' or ''[[oropharyngeal airway]]''. These are designed to provide a passage of air to the [[pharynx]] through the nose or mouth, respectively. Poorly fitted masks often cause nasal bridge ulcers, a problem for some patients. Face masks are also used for [[non-invasive ventilation]] in conscious patients. A full-face mask does not, however, provide protection against aspiration. [[Non-invasive ventilation]] can be considered for epidemics of [[COVID-19]] where sufficient invasive ventilation capacity is not available (or in some milder cases) but pressurized protection suits for caregivers are recommended due to the risks of poorly fitting masks emitting contaminating aerosols.<ref> {{cite journal |vauthors=Murthy S, Gomersall CD, Fowler RA |title=Care for Critically Ill Patients With COVID-19 |journal=JAMA |volume= |issue= |pages= |date=2020-03-11 |doi=10.1001/jama.2020.3633 |pmid=32159735 |url=https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/10.1001/jama.2020.3633}}</ref>\n* ''[[Tracheal intubation]]'' is often performed for mechanical ventilation of hours to weeks duration. A tube is inserted through the nose (nasotracheal intubation) or mouth (orotracheal intubation) and advanced into the [[Vertebrate trachea|trachea]]. In most cases, tubes with inflatable cuffs are used for protection against leakage and aspiration. Intubation with a cuffed tube is thought to provide the best protection against aspiration. Tracheal tubes inevitably cause pain and coughing. Therefore, unless a patient is unconscious or anaesthetized for other reasons, sedative drugs are usually given to provide tolerance of the tube. Other disadvantages of tracheal intubation include damage to the mucosal lining of the [[nasopharynx]] or [[oropharynx]] and [[subglottic stenosis]].\n* ''[[Supraglottic airway]]'' \u2014 a supraglottic airway (SGA) is any airway device that is seated above and outside the trachea, as an alternative to endotracheal intubation. Most devices work via masks or cuffs that inflate to isolate the trachea for oxygen delivery. Newer devices feature esophageal ports for suctioning or ports for tube exchange to allow intubation. Supraglottic airways differ primarily from tracheal intubation in that they do not prevent aspiration. After the introduction of the [[laryngeal mask airway]] (LMA) in 1998, supraglottic airway devices have become mainstream in both elective and emergency anesthesia.<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Cook T, Howes B |title=Supraglottic airway devices: recent advances |journal=Contin Educ Anaesth Crit Care |volume=11 |issue=2 |pages=56\u201361 |date=December 2011 |doi=10.1093/bjaceaccp/mkq058 |url=http://ceaccp.oxfordjournals.org/content/11/2/56.full}}</ref> There are many types of SGAs available including the [[Combitube|Esophageal-tracheal Combitube]] (ETC), [[Laryngeal tube]] (LT), and the obsolete [[Esophageal obturator airway]] (EOA).\n*''[[Cricothyrotomy]]'' \u2014 Patients requiring emergency airway management, in whom tracheal intubation has been unsuccessful, may require an airway inserted through a surgical opening in the [[cricothyroid membrane]]. This is similar to a [[tracheostomy]] but a [[cricothyrotomy]] is reserved for emergency access.<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Carley SD, Gwinnutt C, Butler J, Sammy I, Driscoll P |title=Rapid sequence induction in the emergency department: a strategy for failure |journal=Emerg Med J |volume=19 |issue=2 |pages=109\u201313 |date=March 2002 |pmid=11904254 |pmc=1725832 |doi=10.1136/emj.19.2.109 |url=http://emj.bmj.com/content/19/2/109.full}}</ref>\n* ''[[Tracheostomy]]'' \u2014 When patients require mechanical ventilation for several weeks, a tracheostomy may provide the most suitable access to the trachea. A tracheostomy is a surgically created passage into the [[Vertebrate trachea|trachea]]. Tracheostomy tubes are well tolerated and often do not necessitate any use of sedative drugs. Tracheostomy tubes may be inserted early during treatment in patients with pre-existing severe respiratory disease, or in any patient expected to be difficult to wean from mechanical ventilation, i.e., patients with little muscular reserve.\n* ''Mouthpiece'' \u2014 Less common interface, does not provide protection against aspiration.

It may be used at home or in a nursing or rehabilitation institution if patients have chronic illnesses that require long-term ventilatory assistance.  Due to the anatomy of the human [[pharynx]], [[larynx]], and [[esophagus]] and the circumstances for which ventilation is needed, additional measures are often required to secure the [[Artificial airway|airway]] during positive-pressure ventilation in order to allow unimpeded passage of air into the trachea and avoid air passing into the esophagus and stomach. The common method is by [[Artificial airway|insertion of a tube into the trachea]]: intubation, which provides a clear route for the air. This can be either an [[tracheal tube|endotracheal tube]], inserted through the natural openings of mouth or nose, or a [[tracheostomy]] inserted through an artificial opening in the neck. In other circumstances simple [[Airway management#Airway maneuvers|airway maneuvres]], an [[oropharyngeal airway]] or [[laryngeal mask airway]] may be employed. If the patient is able to protect his/her own airway and [[non-invasive ventilation]] or [[Negative pressure ventilator|negative-pressure ventilation]] is used then an [[Artificial airway|airway adjunct]] may not be needed.{{citation needed|date=March 2016}}\n\n===Negative pressure machines===\n[[Image:Poumon artificiel.jpg|thumb|An iron lung]]\n{{main|Negative pressure ventilator}}\nThe [[Negative pressure ventilator|iron lung]], also known as the Drinker and Shaw tank, was developed in 1929 and was one of the first negative-pressure machines used for long-term ventilation. It was refined and used in the 20th century largely as a result of the [[polio]] [[epidemic]] that struck the world in the 1940s. The machine is, in effect, a large elongated [[tank]], which encases the patient up to the neck. The neck is sealed with a rubber [[gasket]] so that the patient's face (and airway) are exposed to the room air.{{citation needed|date=March 2016}}\n\nWhile the exchange of [[oxygen]] and [[carbon dioxide]] between the bloodstream and the pulmonary airspace works by [[diffusion]] and requires no external work, air must be moved into and out of the [[human lung|lungs]] to make it available to the [[gas exchange]] process. In spontaneous breathing, a negative pressure is created in the [[pleural cavity]] by the muscles of respiration, and the resulting gradient between the [[atmospheric pressure]] and the pressure inside the [[human thorax|thorax]] generates a flow of air.\n\nIn the iron lung by means of a pump, the air is withdrawn mechanically to produce a vacuum inside the tank, thus creating negative pressure. This negative pressure leads to expansion of the chest, which causes a decrease in intrapulmonary pressure, and increases flow of ambient air into the lungs. As the vacuum is released, the pressure inside the tank equalizes to that of the ambient pressure, and the elastic coil of the chest and lungs leads to passive exhalation. However, when the vacuum is created, the abdomen also expands along with the lung, cutting off venous flow back to the heart, leading to pooling of venous blood in the lower extremities. There are large portholes for nurse or home assistant access. The patients can talk and eat normally, and can see the world through a well-placed series of mirrors. Some could remain in these iron lungs for years at a time quite successfully.{{citation needed|date=March 2016}}\n\nToday, negative pressure mechanical ventilators are still in use, notably with the polio wing hospitals in [[England]] such as [[St Thomas' Hospital]] in London and the [[John Radcliffe Hospital|John Radcliffe]] in [[Oxford]]. The prominent device used is a smaller device known as the [[cuirass]]. The cuirass is a shell-like unit, creating negative pressure only to the chest using a combination of a fitting shell and a soft bladder. Its main use is in patients with neuromuscular disorders that have some residual muscular function. However, it was prone to falling off and caused severe chafing and skin damage and was not used as a long-term device. In recent years this device has re-surfaced as a modern [[polycarbonate]] shell with multiple seals and a high-pressure [[oscillation pump]] in order to carry out [[biphasic cuirass ventilation]].\n\n=== Positive pressure ===\n{{main|Ventilator}}\n{{See also|COVID\u201319 related shortages}}\n[[Image:VIP Bird2.jpg|thumb|Neonatal mechanical ventilator]]\nThe design of the modern positive-pressure ventilators were based mainly on technical developments by the military during World War II to supply oxygen to fighter pilots in high altitude. Such ventilators replaced the iron lungs as safe endotracheal tubes with high-volume/low-pressure cuffs were developed. The popularity of positive-pressure ventilators rose during the polio epidemic in the 1950s in Scandinavia and the United States and was the beginning of [[modern ventilation therapy]]. Positive pressure through manual supply of 50% oxygen through a [[tracheostomy]] tube led to a reduced mortality rate among patients with polio and respiratory paralysis. However, because of the sheer amount of man-power required for such manual intervention, mechanical positive-pressure ventilators became increasingly popular.{{citation needed|date=March 2016}}\n\nPositive-pressure ventilators work by increasing the patient's airway pressure through an endotracheal or tracheostomy tube. The positive pressure allows air to flow into the airway until the ventilator breath is terminated. Then, the airway pressure drops to zero, and the elastic recoil of the chest wall and lungs push the [[tidal volume]] \u2014 the breath-out through passive exhalation.\n\n==== Transairway pressure ====\n:::<math> P_\\text{TA} = P_\\text{AO} - P_\\text{ALV}</math>\n* ''P''<sub>TA</sub> = Transairway pressure\n* ''P''<sub>AO</sub> = Pressure at airway opening\n* ''P''<sub>ALV</sub> = Pressure in alveoli\n\n=== Intermittent abdominal pressure ventilator ===\nAnother type is the ''intermittent abdominal pressure ventilator'' that applies pressure externally via an inflated bladder, forcing exhalation, sometimes termed [[exsufflation]].

There are manual ventilators such as [[bag valve mask]]s and [[anesthesia bag]]s that require the users to hold the ventilator to the face or to an [[artificial airway]] and maintain breaths with their hands.  Mechanical ventilators are ventilators not requiring operator effort and are typically computer-controlled or pneumatic-controlled.\n\n=== Mechanical ventilators ===\nMechanical ventilators typically require power by a battery or a wall outlet (DC or AC) though some ventilators work on a pneumatic system not requiring power.\n* '''Transport ventilators''' \u2014 These ventilators are small and more rugged, and can be powered pneumatically or via AC or DC power sources.\n* '''Intensive-care ventilators''' \u2014 These ventilators are larger and usually run on AC power (though virtually all contain a battery to facilitate intra-facility transport and as a back-up in the event of a power failure).  This style of ventilator often provides greater control of a wide variety of ventilation parameters (such as inspiratory rise time).  Many ICU ventilators also incorporate graphics to provide visual feedback of each breath.\n* '''Neonatal ventilators''' ([[Bubble CPAP]]) \u2014 Designed with the preterm neonate in mind, these are a specialized subset of ICU ventilators that are designed to deliver the smaller, more precise volumes and pressures required to ventilate these patients.\n* '''[[Positive airway pressure]] ventilators''' ('''PAP''') \u2014 These ventilators are specifically designed for [[non-invasive ventilation]].  This includes ventilators for use at home for treatment of chronic conditions such as [[sleep apnea]] or [[COPD]].\n\n== Breath delivery ==\n{{unsourced|section|date=March 2020}}\n=== Trigger ===\nThe trigger is what causes a breath to be delivered by a mechanical ventilator.  Breaths may be triggered by a patient taking their own breath, a ventilator operator pressing a manual breath button, or by the ventilator based on the set breath rate and mode of ventilation.\n\n=== Cycle ===\nThe cycle is what causes the breath to transition from the inspiratory phase to the exhalation phase.  Breaths may be cycled by a mechanical ventilator when a set time has been reached, or when a preset flow or percentage of the maximum flow delivered during a breath is reached depending on the breath type and the settings. Breaths can also be cycled when an alarm condition such as a high pressure limit has been reached, which is a primary strategy in [[pressure regulated volume control]].\n\n=== Limit ===\nLimit is how the breath is controlled. Breaths may be limited to a set maximum circuit\npressure or a set maximum flow.\n\n== Breath exhalation ==\nExhalation in mechanical ventilation is almost always completely passive. The ventilator's expiratory valve is opened, and expiratory flow is allowed until the baseline pressure ([[PEEP]]) is reached. Expiratory flow is determined by patient factors such as compliance and resistance.\n\n== Dead space ==\nMechanical dead space is defined as the volume of gas breathed again as the result of use in a mechanical device.{{citation needed|date=March 2016}}\n\n;Example of calculation for mechanical dead space \n<math chem> V_{Dmech} = V_T - V_{Dphys} - \\frac{Pa\\ce{CO2}(V_T - V_D - V_{Dmech})}{P_{A\\ce{CO2}}}</math>\n\n;Simplified version\n<math chem> \\frac{V_D}{V_T} = \\frac{Pa\\ce{CO2} - P\\bar{E}\\ce{CO2}}{Pa\\ce{CO2}}</math>\n\n== Modes of ventilation ==\n{{Main|Modes of mechanical ventilation}}\nMechanical ventilation utilizes several separate systems for ventilation referred to as the mode.  Modes come in many different delivery concepts but all modes fall into one of three categories;  volume-cycled, pressure-cycled, spontaneously cycled.  In general, the selection of which mode of mechanical ventilation to use for a given patient is based on the familiarity of [[clinician]]s with modes and the equipment availability at a particular institution.<ref name=\"pmid10806138\">{{cite journal |vauthors=Esteban A, Anzueto A, Al\u00eda I, Gordo F, Apeztegu\u00eda C, P\u00e1lizas F, etal | title=How is mechanical ventilation employed in the intensive care unit?

The estimated shunt fraction refers to the amount of oxygen not being absorbed into the circulation. In normal physiology, gas exchange (oxygen/carbon dioxide) occurs at the level of the [[Pulmonary alveolus|alveoli]] in the lungs. The existence of a shunt refers to any process that hinders this gas exchange, leading to wasted oxygen inspired and the flow of un-oxygenated blood back to the left heart (which ultimately supplies the rest of the body with unoxygenated blood).\n\nWhen using 100% O2 (''Fi''{{chem|O|2}} 1.00), the degree of shunting is estimated by subtracting the measured ''Pa''{{chem|O|2}} (from an [[arterial blood gas]]) from 700 mmHg. For each difference of 100 mmHg, the shunt is 5%. A shunt of more than 25% should prompt a search for the cause of this hypoxemia, such as mainstem intubation or [[pneumothorax]], and should be treated accordingly. If such complications are not present, other causes must be sought after, and [[positive end-expiratory pressure]] (PEEP) should be used to treat this intrapulmonary shunt. Other such causes of a shunt include:\n* Alveolar collapse from major [[atelectasis]]\n* Alveolar collection of material other than gas, such as pus from [[pneumonia]], water and protein from [[acute respiratory distress syndrome]], water from [[congestive heart failure]], or blood from haemorrhage{{citation needed|date=March 2016}}\n\n=== Weaning from mechanical ventilation ===\nTiming of withdrawal from mechanical ventilation\u2014also known as weaning\u2014should be carefully considered. Patients should have their ventilation considered for withdrawal if they are able to support their own ventilation and oxygenation, and this should be assessed continuously. There are several objective parameters to look for when considering withdrawal, but there are no specific criteria that generalizes to all patients.\n\nThe [[Rapid Shallow Breathing Index]] (RSBI, the ratio of respiratory frequency to tidal volume (f/VT), previously referred to as the \"Tobin Index\" after Dr. Martin Tobin of [[Loyola University Medical Center]]) is one of the best studied and most commonly used weaning predictors, with no other predictor having been shown to be superior. It was described in a prospective cohort study of mechanically ventilated patients which found that a RSBI > 105 breaths/min/L was associated with weaning failure, while a RSBI < 105 breaths/min/L predicted weaning success with a sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value and negative predictive value of 97%, 64%, 78%, 95% respectively.<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Yang KL, Tobin MJ |title=A prospective study of indexes predicting the outcome of trials of weaning from mechanical ventilation |journal=N.

In patients who have diffused loss of aeration, PEEP can be used provided it does not cause the plateau pressure to rise above the upper inflection point.\n\nMost modern ventilators have basic monitoring tools. There are also monitors that work independently of the ventilator which allow for measuring patients after the ventilator has been removed, such as a [[tracheal tube |T tube test]].\n\n==Artificial airways as a connection to the ventilator==\n{{Main|Artificial airway}}\nThere are various procedures and mechanical devices that provide protection against airway collapse, air leakage, and [[Pulmonary aspiration|aspiration]]:\n* [[Respirator|Face mask]] \u2014 In resuscitation and for minor procedures under anaesthesia, a face mask is often sufficient to achieve a seal against air leakage. Airway patency of the unconscious patient is maintained either by manipulation of the jaw or by the use of ''nasopharyngeal'' or ''[[oropharyngeal airway]]''. These are designed to provide a passage of air to the [[pharynx]] through the nose or mouth, respectively. Poorly fitted masks often cause nasal bridge ulcers, a problem for some patients. Face masks are also used for [[non-invasive ventilation]] in conscious patients. A full-face mask does not, however, provide protection against aspiration. [[Non-invasive ventilation]] can be considered for epidemics of [[COVID-19]] where sufficient invasive ventilation capacity is not available (or in some milder cases) but pressurized protection suits for caregivers are recommended due to the risks of poorly fitting masks emitting contaminating aerosols.<ref> {{cite journal |vauthors=Murthy S, Gomersall CD, Fowler RA |title=Care for Critically Ill Patients With COVID-19 |journal=JAMA |volume= |issue= |pages= |date=2020-03-11 |doi=10.1001/jama.2020.3633 |pmid=32159735 |url=https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/10.1001/jama.2020.3633}}</ref>\n* ''[[Tracheal intubation]]'' is often performed for mechanical ventilation of hours to weeks duration. A tube is inserted through the nose (nasotracheal intubation) or mouth (orotracheal intubation) and advanced into the [[Vertebrate trachea|trachea]]. In most cases, tubes with inflatable cuffs are used for protection against leakage and aspiration. Intubation with a cuffed tube is thought to provide the best protection against aspiration. Tracheal tubes inevitably cause pain and coughing. Therefore, unless a patient is unconscious or anaesthetized for other reasons, sedative drugs are usually given to provide tolerance of the tube. Other disadvantages of tracheal intubation include damage to the mucosal lining of the [[nasopharynx]] or [[oropharynx]] and [[subglottic stenosis]].\n* ''[[Supraglottic airway]]'' \u2014 a supraglottic airway (SGA) is any airway device that is seated above and outside the trachea, as an alternative to endotracheal intubation. Most devices work via masks or cuffs that inflate to isolate the trachea for oxygen delivery. Newer devices feature esophageal ports for suctioning or ports for tube exchange to allow intubation. Supraglottic airways differ primarily from tracheal intubation in that they do not prevent aspiration. After the introduction of the [[laryngeal mask airway]] (LMA) in 1998, supraglottic airway devices have become mainstream in both elective and emergency anesthesia.<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Cook T, Howes B |title=Supraglottic airway devices: recent advances |journal=Contin Educ Anaesth Crit Care |volume=11 |issue=2 |pages=56\u201361 |date=December 2011 |doi=10.1093/bjaceaccp/mkq058 |url=http://ceaccp.oxfordjournals.org/content/11/2/56.full}}</ref> There are many types of SGAs available including the [[Combitube|Esophageal-tracheal Combitube]] (ETC), [[Laryngeal tube]] (LT), and the obsolete [[Esophageal obturator airway]] (EOA).\n*''[[Cricothyrotomy]]'' \u2014 Patients requiring emergency airway management, in whom tracheal intubation has been unsuccessful, may require an airway inserted through a surgical opening in the [[cricothyroid membrane]].

The next season, the SuperSonics traded Haywood to [[New York Knicks|New York]] forcing the remaining players to pick up the offensive slack. Guard [[Fred Brown (basketball)|Fred Brown]], now in his fifth season, was selected to the [[1976 NBA All-Star Game]] and finished fifth in the league in scoring average and free throw percentage. Burleson's game continued to strengthen, while Watts led the NBA in both assists and steals and was named to the [[NBA All-Defensive Team|All-NBA Defensive First Team]]. The SuperSonics again [[1976 NBA Playoffs|made the playoffs]], but lost to the [[Phoenix Suns]] in six games in spite of strong performances from both Brown (28.5 ppg) and Burleson (20.8 ppg) during the series.\n\nRussell left the SuperSonics after the [[1976\u201377 NBA season|1976\u201377 season]], and under new coach [[Bob Hopkins]] the team started the season dismally at 5\u201317. Lenny Wilkens was brought back to replace Hopkins, and the team's fortunes immediately turned around. The SuperSonics won 11 of their first 12 games under Wilkens, finished the season at 47\u201335, won the Western Conference title, and led the [[Washington Bullets]] three games to two before losing in seven games in the [[1978 NBA Finals]]. Other than the loss of center [[Marvin Webster]] to New York, the SuperSonics roster stayed largely intact during the off-season, and in the [[1978\u201379 NBA season|1978\u201379 season]] they went on to win their first division title. [[1979 NBA Playoffs|In the playoffs]], the SuperSonics defeated the Phoenix Suns in a tough seven game conference final series to set up a rematch with the Washington Bullets in the finals. This time, the Bullets lost to the SuperSonics in five games to give Seattle its first, and only, NBA title.

In 1984, Fred Brown retired after playing 13 productive seasons, all with Seattle. His career reflected much of the SuperSonics' history to that time because he had been on the same team roster as Rule and Wilkens during his rookie season, playing a key role on Seattle's first playoff teams, and being the team's important sixth man during the championship series years. In recognition of his many contributions to the team, Brown's number was retired in 1986. Lenny Wilkens left the organization following the [[1984\u201385 NBA season|1984\u201385 season]], and when Jack Sikma was traded after the 1985\u201386 season, the last remaining tie to the SuperSonics' championship team (aside from trainer Frank Furtado) had been severed.\n\nAmong the few SuperSonics highlights of second half of the 1980s were [[Tom Chambers (basketball)|Tom Chambers]]' [[NBA All-Star Game MVP Award|All-Star Game MVP]] award in 1987, Seattle's surprise appearance in the 1987 Western Conference Finals, despite posting a 39\u201343 regular season record during the [[1986-87 NBA season|1986-87 season]], and the performance of the power trio of Chambers, [[Xavier McDaniel]], and [[Dale Ellis]].

With the continued improvement of Gary Payton and Shawn Kemp, the SuperSonics posted a 55\u201327 record in the [[1992\u201393 NBA season|1992\u201393 season]] and took the Phoenix Suns to seven games in the Western Conference Finals.\n\nThe next year, [[1993\u201394 NBA season|1993\u201394]], the SuperSonics had the best record in the NBA at 63\u201319, but suffered a [[1994 NBA Playoffs|first round loss]] to the [[Denver Nuggets]], becoming the first #1 seed to lose a playoff series to an 8th seed. The Sonics moved to the [[Tacoma Dome]] for the [[1994\u201395 NBA season|1994\u201395 season]] while the Coliseum underwent renovations and went on to earn a second place 57-25 record. Again, the Sonics were eliminated in the first round, this time to the [[Los Angeles Lakers]] in four games. The team returned to the rebuilt Coliseum, renamed [[KeyArena]] for the [[1995\u201396 NBA season|1995\u201396 season]].\n\nPerhaps the strongest roster the SuperSonics ever had was the 1995\u201396 team, which had a franchise best 64\u201318 record. With a deep roster of All-NBA Second Team selections Kemp and Payton, forward [[Detlef Schrempf]], forward [[Sam Perkins]], guard [[Hersey Hawkins]], and guard [[Nate McMillan]], the team reached the [[1996 NBA Finals|NBA Finals]], but lost to the [[Michael Jordan|Michael Jordan-led]] [[Chicago Bulls]] in six games. Seattle continued to be a Western Conference powerhouse during the next two seasons, winning 57 games in [[1996\u201397 NBA season|1996\u201397]] and 61 games in [[1997\u201398 NBA season|1997\u201398]] for their second and third straight Pacific Division titles. At the end of the 1997\u201398 season long-time Sonic and defensive specialist McMillan retired, and disagreements with management led Karl to end his tenure as head coach. He was replaced by former Sonic [[Paul Westphal]] for the 1998\u201399 season.\n\n===1998\u20132008: A decade of struggles===\n[[File:Lipofsky-Vin Baker.jpg|thumb|160px|[[Vin Baker]] was an [[NBA All-Star]] with the [[SuperSonics]] during the 1997\u201398 season.]]\nThe 1998\u201399 season saw the SuperSonics struggle.

The Sonics would proceed to lose in 6 games to the established trio of [[Tony Parker]], [[Tim Duncan]], and [[Manu Gin\u00f3bili]] and the [[San Antonio Spurs]], who subsequently defeated the [[Detroit Pistons]] in the [[2005 NBA Finals]]. This appearance also marked the last time that this incarnation of the SuperSonics would make the playoffs. During the off-season in 2005, head coach McMillan left the Sonics to accept a high-paying position to coach the [[Portland Trail Blazers]]. After his departure, the team regressed the following season with a 35\u201347 record.\n\n====2007\u201308: Arrival of Kevin Durant====\nOn May 22, 2007, the SuperSonics were awarded the 2nd pick in the [[2007 NBA draft]], equaling the highest draft position the team has ever held. They selected [[Kevin Durant]] from the [[Texas Longhorns men's basketball|University of Texas]]. On June 28, 2007, the SuperSonics traded [[Ray Allen]] and the 35th pick of the 2nd round ([[Glen Davis (basketball)|Glen Davis]]) in the [[2007 NBA draft]] to the [[Boston Celtics]] for rights to the 5th pick [[Jeff Green (basketball)|Jeff Green]], [[Wally Szczerbiak]], and [[Delonte West]]. On July 11, 2007, the SuperSonics and the [[Orlando Magic]] agreed to a sign and trade for [[Rashard Lewis]]. The SuperSonics received a future second-round draft pick and a $9.5 million trade exception from the Magic. On July 20 the SuperSonics used the trade exception and a second-round draft pick to acquire [[Kurt Thomas (basketball)|Kurt Thomas]] and two first-round draft picks from the [[Phoenix Suns]].{{citation needed|date=January 2017}}\n\nIn 2008, morale was low at the beginning of the SuperSonics season as talks with the City of Seattle for a new arena had broken down. The Sonics had gotten a franchise player with second overall pick in the NBA draft with Durant. However, with the Allen trade the Sonics did not have much talent to surround their rookie forward, as they lost their first eight games under coach [[P. J. Carlesimo]] on the way to a 3-14 record in the first month of the season. Durant would live up to expectations, as he led all rookies in scoring at 20.3 ppg and won the Rookie of the Year. However, the Seattle SuperSonics posted a franchise worst record of 20-62. It would end up being the final season in Seattle as Bennett ended up getting the rights to move the team after settling all the legal issues with the city.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sportsecyclopedia.com/nba/seattle/sonics.html |title=Seattle Supersonics (1967\u20132008) |publisher=Sportsecyclopedia.com |date= |accessdate=July 20, 2012}}</ref> The Seattle SuperSonics played their last game on April 13, 2008, winning 99-95 versus the [[Dallas Mavericks]].

The team, which starred Haywood, guards [[Fred Brown (basketball)|Fred Brown]] and [[Slick Watts]], and rookie center [[Tommy Burleson]], defeated the [[Detroit Pistons]] in a three-game mini-series before falling to the eventual champion [[Golden State Warriors]] in six games. The next season, the SuperSonics traded Haywood to [[New York Knicks|New York]] forcing the remaining players to pick up the offensive slack. Guard [[Fred Brown (basketball)|Fred Brown]], now in his fifth season, was selected to the [[1976 NBA All-Star Game]] and finished fifth in the league in scoring average and free throw percentage. Burleson's game continued to strengthen, while Watts led the NBA in both assists and steals and was named to the [[NBA All-Defensive Team|All-NBA Defensive First Team]]. The SuperSonics again [[1976 NBA Playoffs|made the playoffs]], but lost to the [[Phoenix Suns]] in six games in spite of strong performances from both Brown (28.5 ppg) and Burleson (20.8 ppg) during the series.\n\nRussell left the SuperSonics after the [[1976\u201377 NBA season|1976\u201377 season]], and under new coach [[Bob Hopkins]] the team started the season dismally at 5\u201317. Lenny Wilkens was brought back to replace Hopkins, and the team's fortunes immediately turned around. The SuperSonics won 11 of their first 12 games under Wilkens, finished the season at 47\u201335, won the Western Conference title, and led the [[Washington Bullets]] three games to two before losing in seven games in the [[1978 NBA Finals]]. Other than the loss of center [[Marvin Webster]] to New York, the SuperSonics roster stayed largely intact during the off-season, and in the [[1978\u201379 NBA season|1978\u201379 season]] they went on to win their first division title. [[1979 NBA Playoffs|In the playoffs]], the SuperSonics defeated the Phoenix Suns in a tough seven game conference final series to set up a rematch with the Washington Bullets in the finals. This time, the Bullets lost to the SuperSonics in five games to give Seattle its first, and only, NBA title.

In 1984, Fred Brown retired after playing 13 productive seasons, all with Seattle. His career reflected much of the SuperSonics' history to that time because he had been on the same team roster as Rule and Wilkens during his rookie season, playing a key role on Seattle's first playoff teams, and being the team's important sixth man during the championship series years. In recognition of his many contributions to the team, Brown's number was retired in 1986. Lenny Wilkens left the organization following the [[1984\u201385 NBA season|1984\u201385 season]], and when Jack Sikma was traded after the 1985\u201386 season, the last remaining tie to the SuperSonics' championship team (aside from trainer Frank Furtado) had been severed.\n\nAmong the few SuperSonics highlights of second half of the 1980s were [[Tom Chambers (basketball)|Tom Chambers]]' [[NBA All-Star Game MVP Award|All-Star Game MVP]] award in 1987, Seattle's surprise appearance in the 1987 Western Conference Finals, despite posting a 39\u201343 regular season record during the [[1986-87 NBA season|1986-87 season]], and the performance of the power trio of Chambers, [[Xavier McDaniel]], and [[Dale Ellis]]. In 1987\u201388, the three players each averaged over 20 points per game with Ellis at 25.8 ppg, McDaniel at 21.4, and Chambers at 20.4. In the [[1988\u201389 NBA season|1988\u201389 season]], with Chambers having signed with Phoenix, Ellis improved his scoring average to 27.5 points per game and finished second in the league in three-point percentage. The SuperSonics finished with a 47\u201335 record, and made it to the second round of the [[1989 NBA Playoffs|1989 playoffs]].\n\n===1989\u20131998: The Payton/Kemp era===\n[[File:George Karl.jpg|thumb|150px|[[George Karl]] served as Seattle's head coach for six seasons (1992\u20131998).]]\nThe SuperSonics began setting a new foundation with the drafting of forward [[Shawn Kemp]] in 1989 and guard [[Gary Payton]] in 1990, and the trading of [[Dale Ellis]] and [[Xavier McDaniel]] to other teams during the [[1990\u201391 NBA season|1990\u201391 season]]. It was [[George Karl]]'s arrival as head coach in 1992, however, that marked a return to regular season and playoff competitiveness for the SuperSonics. With the continued improvement of Gary Payton and Shawn Kemp, the SuperSonics posted a 55\u201327 record in the [[1992\u201393 NBA season|1992\u201393 season]] and took the Phoenix Suns to seven games in the Western Conference Finals.\n\nThe next year, [[1993\u201394 NBA season|1993\u201394]], the SuperSonics had the best record in the NBA at 63\u201319, but suffered a [[1994 NBA Playoffs|first round loss]] to the [[Denver Nuggets]], becoming the first #1 seed to lose a playoff series to an 8th seed. The Sonics moved to the [[Tacoma Dome]] for the [[1994\u201395 NBA season|1994\u201395 season]] while the Coliseum underwent renovations and went on to earn a second place 57-25 record. Again, the Sonics were eliminated in the first round, this time to the [[Los Angeles Lakers]] in four games. The team returned to the rebuilt Coliseum, renamed [[KeyArena]] for the [[1995\u201396 NBA season|1995\u201396 season]].\n\nPerhaps the strongest roster the SuperSonics ever had was the 1995\u201396 team, which had a franchise best 64\u201318 record. With a deep roster of All-NBA Second Team selections Kemp and Payton, forward [[Detlef Schrempf]], forward [[Sam Perkins]], guard [[Hersey Hawkins]], and guard [[Nate McMillan]], the team reached the [[1996 NBA Finals|NBA Finals]], but lost to the [[Michael Jordan|Michael Jordan-led]] [[Chicago Bulls]] in six games. Seattle continued to be a Western Conference powerhouse during the next two seasons, winning 57 games in [[1996\u201397 NBA season|1996\u201397]] and 61 games in [[1997\u201398 NBA season|1997\u201398]] for their second and third straight Pacific Division titles. At the end of the 1997\u201398 season long-time Sonic and defensive specialist McMillan retired, and disagreements with management led Karl to end his tenure as head coach. He was replaced by former Sonic [[Paul Westphal]] for the 1998\u201399 season.\n\n===1998\u20132008: A decade of struggles===\n[[File:Lipofsky-Vin Baker.jpg|thumb|160px|[[Vin Baker]] was an [[NBA All-Star]] with the [[SuperSonics]] during the 1997\u201398 season.]]\nThe 1998\u201399 season saw the SuperSonics struggle.

The Sonics would proceed to lose in 6 games to the established trio of [[Tony Parker]], [[Tim Duncan]], and [[Manu Gin\u00f3bili]] and the [[San Antonio Spurs]], who subsequently defeated the [[Detroit Pistons]] in the [[2005 NBA Finals]]. This appearance also marked the last time that this incarnation of the SuperSonics would make the playoffs. During the off-season in 2005, head coach McMillan left the Sonics to accept a high-paying position to coach the [[Portland Trail Blazers]]. After his departure, the team regressed the following season with a 35\u201347 record.\n\n====2007\u201308: Arrival of Kevin Durant====\nOn May 22, 2007, the SuperSonics were awarded the 2nd pick in the [[2007 NBA draft]], equaling the highest draft position the team has ever held. They selected [[Kevin Durant]] from the [[Texas Longhorns men's basketball|University of Texas]]. On June 28, 2007, the SuperSonics traded [[Ray Allen]] and the 35th pick of the 2nd round ([[Glen Davis (basketball)|Glen Davis]]) in the [[2007 NBA draft]] to the [[Boston Celtics]] for rights to the 5th pick [[Jeff Green (basketball)|Jeff Green]], [[Wally Szczerbiak]], and [[Delonte West]]. On July 11, 2007, the SuperSonics and the [[Orlando Magic]] agreed to a sign and trade for [[Rashard Lewis]].

The Sonics had gotten a franchise player with second overall pick in the NBA draft with Durant. However, with the Allen trade the Sonics did not have much talent to surround their rookie forward, as they lost their first eight games under coach [[P. J. Carlesimo]] on the way to a 3-14 record in the first month of the season. Durant would live up to expectations, as he led all rookies in scoring at 20.3 ppg and won the Rookie of the Year. However, the Seattle SuperSonics posted a franchise worst record of 20-62. It would end up being the final season in Seattle as Bennett ended up getting the rights to move the team after settling all the legal issues with the city.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sportsecyclopedia.com/nba/seattle/sonics.html |title=Seattle Supersonics (1967\u20132008) |publisher=Sportsecyclopedia.com |date= |accessdate=July 20, 2012}}</ref> The Seattle SuperSonics played their last game on April 13, 2008, winning 99-95 versus the [[Dallas Mavericks]].

Following the outbreak of the [[French Revolution]], he exhibited great military talent, rapidly rising through the ranks and was made a [[brigadier general]] by 1794. He served with distinction in Italy and Germany, and was briefly Minister of War. His relationship with [[Napoleon]] was turbulent; nevertheless, Napoleon named him a [[Marshal of the Empire]] on the proclamation of the [[First French Empire|French Empire]]. Bernadotte played a significant role in the French victory at [[Battle of Austerlitz|Austerlitz]], and was made [[Principality of Pontecorvo|Prince of Pontecorvo]] as a reward.\n\nIn 1810, Bernadotte was unexpectedly elected the [[heir-presumptive]] to the childless King [[Charles XIII of Sweden]], thanks to the advocacy of Baron [[Carl Otto M\u00f6rner]], a Swedish courtier and obscure member of the [[Riksdag of the Estates]].{{sfn|Cronholm|1902|pp=249\u201371}} He assumed the name Charles John and became the ''[[de facto]]'' regent and head of state. In 1813, following the sudden unprovoked French invasion of [[Swedish Pomerania]], Crown Prince Charles John aligned Sweden with Napoleon's enemies in the [[War of the Sixth Coalition|Sixth Coalition]], wherein he authored the Allied campaign plan, and commanded the Allied Army of the North that made the decisive attack on the last day of the catastrophic French defeat at [[Battle of Leipzig|Leipzig]]. He went on to defeat Denmark and forced Norway into a [[Union between Sweden and Norway|union with Sweden]].\n\nUpon the death of [[Charles XIII of Sweden|Charles XIII]] in 1818, Charles John ascended to the throne as the first monarch from the [[House of Bernadotte]]. He presided over a period of peace and prosperity, and reigned until his death in 1844.\n\n==Early life and family==\n[[File:Pau Bernadotte.JPG|100px|thumb|left|Bernadotte's birthplace in [[Pau, Pyr\u00e9n\u00e9es-Atlantiques|Pau]], France]]\nBernadotte was born in [[Pau, Pyr\u00e9n\u00e9es-Atlantiques|Pau]], France, as the son of Jean Henri Bernadotte (1711\u20131780), [[prosecutor]] at Pau, and his wife (married at [[Boeil-Bezing|Boeil]], 20 February 1754) Jeanne de Saint-Jean (1728\u20131809), [[niece]] of the [[Lay Abbot]] of [[Sireix]]. The family name was originally du Poey (or de Pouey), but was changed to Bernadotte\u2014a surname of an ancestress at the beginning of the 17th century.{{sfn|Bain|1911|p=931}} Soon after his birth, Baptiste was added to his name, to distinguish him from his elder brother Jean \u00c9vangeliste. Bernadotte himself added Jules to his first names as a tribute to the French Empire under [[Napoleon I]].{{sfn|Bain|1911|p=931}}\n\nAt the age of 14, he was apprenticed to a local attorney. However, the death of his father when Bernadotte was just 17 stopped the youth from following his father's career.<ref>Palmer, Alan (1990). p. 6</ref>\n\n==Early military career==\nBernadotte joined the army as a private in the [[R\u00e9giment Royal\u2013La Marine]] on 3 September 1780,<ref>Barton, Dunbar Plunket (1930). p. 5</ref> and first served in the newly conquered territory of [[Corsica]].{{sfn|Bain|1911|p=931}} Subsequently, the R\u00e9giment stationed in [[Besan\u00e7on]], [[Grenoble]], [[Vienne]], [[Marseille]] and [[\u00cele de R\u00e9]].<ref>Palmer, Alan (1990). pp. 8\u201313</ref><ref>Barton, Dunbar Plunket (1930). p. 14</ref> He reached the rank of sergeant in August 1785 and was nicknamed ''Sergeant Belle-Jambe'', for his smart appearance.<ref>Barton, Dunbar Plunket (1930). p. 11</ref> In early 1790 he was promoted to [[Adjudant-Major]], the highest rank for [[non-commissioned officer]]s in the Ancien R\u00e9gime.<ref>Palmer, Alan (1990). p. 15</ref>\n\n==Revolutionary Wars==\nFollowing the outbreak of the [[French Revolution]], his eminent military qualities brought him speedy promotion.{{sfn|Bain|1911|p=931}} Bernadotte's promotions came both from the esteem of his commanders as well as from his men; having been elected to the rank of lieutenant colonel and colonel by his men, though he refused both nominations in favor of traditional advancement.<ref>Barton, Dunbar Plunket (1914). ''Bernadotte: The First Phase''. pp. 50\u201352, 70\u201371.</ref>\n\nIt was during this period of rapid advancement that the military qualities he became known for, daring assaults and Gasconades, came to the fore. Of the latter, Bernadotte was gifted in his ability to inspire his men to prodigious feats of valor. As Colonel and commander of the 71st Demi-Brigade, Bernadotte rallied his men, who were retreating in disorder before an Austrian attack, by tearing off his epaulettes, throwing them to the ground before his men and shouting \u201cIf you dishonor yourselves by flight, I refuse to remain your colonel!\u201d Soldiers left the ranks, gathered his epaulettes, pressed them into his hands, formed ranks and reformed the line and counter-attacked.<ref>Ibid, pp. 76\u201377.</ref>\n\nBy 1794 he was promoted to brigadier, attached to the [[Army of Sambre-et-Meuse]].{{sfn|Bain|1911|p=931}} After [[Jean-Baptiste Jourdan|Jourdan]]'s victory at [[Battle of Fleurus (1794)|Fleurus]] (26 June 1794), where he distinguished himself with a decisive attack and seizure of key terrain that led to the Austrian retreat, he then became a divisional general.<ref>Barton, Dunbar Plunket (1914). ''Bernadotte: The First Phase''. pp. 92\u201394</ref>\n\nBernadotte played key roles throughout the next 18 months during the three French invasions into Germany; often employed in the place of honor during offensives leading the vanguard, and in retreat as a defensive specialist commanding the rearguard.<ref>Ibid. pp. 98\u2013101</ref>\n\nAt the [[Battle of Theiningen]] (1796), Bernadotte contributed, more than anyone else, to the successful retreat of the French army over the [[Rhine]] after its defeat by the [[Archduke Charles of Austria]].<ref>Ibid. pp. 110\u201314.</ref>\n\nAt the beginning of 1797 he was ordered by the Directory to march with 20,000 men as reinforcements to [[Napoleon Bonaparte]]'s army in Italy.{{sfn|The American Cyclop\u00e6dia |1879|p=571}} His successful crossing of the Alps through the storm in midwinter was highly praised but coldly received by the Italian Army.<ref>Barton, Dunbar Plunket (1930). p. 42</ref><ref>Palmer, Alan (1990). p. 42</ref> Upon receiving insult from [[Dominique Martin Dupuy]], the commander of Milan, Bernadotte was to arrest him for insubordination.<ref>Palmer, Alan (1990). pp. 42\u201343</ref> However, Dupuy was a close friend of [[Louis-Alexandre Berthier]] and this started a long-lasting feud between Bernadotte and Napoleon's Chief of Staff.<ref>Barton, Dunbar Plunket (1930). p. 44</ref>\n\nHe had his first interview with Napoleon in Mantua and was appointed the commander of the 4th division.<ref>Palmer, Alan (1990). p. 43</ref> During the invasion of Friuli and Istria, Bernadotte distinguished himself greatly at the passage of the [[Tagliamento]] where he led the vanguard, and at the capture of the fortress of Gradisca (19 March 1797).{{sfn|The American Cyclop\u00e6dia |1879|p=571}} After the [[Coup of 18 Fructidor|18th Fructidor]], Napoleon ordered his generals to collect from their respective divisions' addresses in favor of the coup d'\u00e9tat of that day; but Bernadotte sent an address to the directory different from that which Napoleon wished for and without conveying it through Napoleon's hands.{{sfn|The American Cyclop\u00e6dia |1879|p=571}}\n\nAfter the [[treaty of Campo Formio]], Napoleon gave Bernadotte a friendly visit at his headquarters at Udine, but immediately after deprived him of half his division of the army of the Rhine, and commanded him to march the other half back to France.{{sfn|The American Cyclop\u00e6dia |1879|p=571}} [[Paul Barras]], one of five directors, was cautious that Napoleon would overturn the Republic, so he appointed Bernadotte commander-in-chief of the Italian Army in order to offset Napoleon's power.<ref>Palmer, Alan (1990). pp. 60\u201361</ref> Bernadotte was pleased with this appointment but Napoleon lobbied [[Charles Maurice de Talleyrand-P\u00e9rigord|Talleyrand-P\u00e9rigord]], the Minister of Foreign Affairs, to appoint him to the embassy of [[Vienna]] instead.<ref>Palmer, Alan (1990). p. 61</ref> Bernadotte was very dissatisfied; he finally accepted the post in Vienna, but had to quit owing to the disturbances caused by his hoisting the [[Flag of France|tricolour]] over the [[embassy]].{{sfn|Bain|1911|p=931}}{{sfn|The American Cyclop\u00e6dia |1879|p=571}}\n\nAfter returning from Vienna, he resided in Paris. He married [[D\u00e9sir\u00e9e Clary]] in August 1798, the daughter of a Marseilles merchant and [[Joseph Bonaparte]]'s sister-in-law.{{sfn|The American Cyclop\u00e6dia |1879|p=571}} In November of the same year he was made commander of the army of observation on the upper Rhine. Although solicited to do so by Barras and Joseph Bonaparte, he did not take part in [[Coup of 30 Prairial VII|the coup d'\u00e9tat of the 30th Prairial]].<ref>Palmer, Alan (1990). p. 84</ref> From 2 July to 14 September he was [[List of Defence Ministers of France|Minister of War]], in which capacity he displayed great ability.{{sfn|The American Cyclop\u00e6dia |1879|p=571}} However, his popularity and contacts with radical Jacobins aroused antipathy towards him in the government.<ref>Palmer, Alan (1990). p. 88</ref> On the morning of 13 September he found his resignation announced in the Moniteur before he was aware that he had tendered it. This was a trick; played upon him by [[Emmanuel Joseph Siey\u00e8s|Siey\u00e8s]] and [[Roger Ducos]], the directors allied to Napoleon.{{sfn|The American Cyclop\u00e6dia |1879|p=571}}\n\nHe declined to help Napoleon Bonaparte stage his [[Coup of 18 Brumaire|''coup d'\u00e9tat'' of November 1799]] but nevertheless accepted employment from the [[French Consulate|Consulate]], and from April 1800 to 18 August 1801 Commander-in-Chief of the Army of the West, in the rebellious [[Vend\u00e9e]], and successfully restored its tranquility.{{sfn|Bain|1911|p=931}}{{sfn|The American Cyclop\u00e6dia |1879|p=571}}\n\nIn 1802, Napoleon Bonaparte proposed that Bernadotte head to New France to serve as governor of [[Louisiana]], which was to be transferred back to French control following the [[Third Treaty of San Ildefonso]]. In accepting the position, Bernadotte requested additional soldiers, settlers, and funding to support the colony, but Napoleon refused. In response, Bernadotte, declined the posting and instead was named plenipotentiary ambassador to the United States.

In this capacity, as well as during his later command of the army of northern Germany, he created for himself a reputation for independence, incorruptibility, moderation, and administrative ability.{{sfn|The American Cyclop\u00e6dia |1879|p=571}}\n\nDuring the campaign of 1805, Bernadotte, with his army corps from Hanover formed into the I Corps, commanded the Left Wing of the Grand Army overseeing Marmont's II Corps and having the majority of the Bavarian Army attached to his command; some 65,000 men or 1/4th of the Army. Bernadotte was also tasked with assuring France's newest ally, the Elector of Bavaria, [[Maximilian_I_Joseph_of_Bavaria|Maximillian Joseph]], that the Austrians would be driven from his country.<ref>Maude, F.A (1912) pp. 150-151</ref><ref>Barton, D.

Plunkett (1921) pp. 108-109</ref> I Corps then co-operated in the great movement which resulted in the shutting off of [[Karl Mack von Leiberich|Mack]] in the Battle of [[Battle of Ulm|Ulm]]. Bernadotte's troops then captured [[Salzburg]] on 30 October.<ref>Maude, F.A (1912) pp. 222-226</ref>\n\nIn the Battle of [[Battle of Austerlitz|Austerlitz]] (2 December 1805) he was posted with his corps in the center between [[Jean-de-Dieu Soult|Soult]] and [[Jean Lannes|Lannes]], and contributed to defeating the attempt of the right wing of the allies to outflank the French army.{{sfn|The American Cyclop\u00e6dia |1879|p=571}} As a reward for his services at Austerlitz, he became the 1st Sovereign [[Prince]] of [[Ponte Corvo]] (5 June 1806), a district of Naples formerly subject to the Pope.{{sfn|Bain|1911|p=932}}{{sfn|The American Cyclop\u00e6dia |1879|p=571}}\n\nHowever, during the campaign against [[Prussia]], in the same year, he was severely reproached by Napoleon for not participating with his army corps in the battles of [[Battle of Jena|Jena]] and [[Battle of Auerst\u00e4dt|Auerst\u00e4dt]] (14 October 1806).{{sfn|Bain|1911|p=932}} Napoleon, on the night of 13 October, thinking he had faced the whole Prussian army at Jena, sent orders to Bernadotte and [[Louis-Nicolas Davout|Davout]] to fall back from [[Naumburg]] and get across the Prussian line of retreat. In pursuance of these orders, Bernadotte, separately from Davout, left Naumburg at dawn on the morning of the 14th for [[Dornburg]] and marched towards [[Apolda]], which he reached by 16:00. Hampered by the very poor state of the roads, he could not engage in the Battle of Jena, though he effectively compelled the Prussians to retreat from both battlefields by posting his troops on the heights of Apolda.{{sfn|Titeux, Eugene|1903|pp=86\u2013104}}{{sfn|Foucart, Paul Jean|1887|pp=694\u201397}}{{sfn|Alison, Sir Archibald|1836|pp=758, 764\u201365}}\nAfterwards, Bernadotte was accused of deliberately refusing to support Davout, who had unexpectedly encountered the Prussian main army at Auerst\u00e4dt, out of jealousy, and Napoleon, if reminiscences from St. Helena may be believed, once intended to put Bernadotte before a court-martial.{{sfn|Favier, Franck|2010|pp=137\u201339}}{{sfn|Palmer, Alan|1990|p=135}} In fact, he did what he had been ordered to do, and more fundamental responsibility for his absence rests upon the ambiguous and indirect orders issued by Berthier and Napoleon's unawareness of the Prussian position.{{sfn|Alison, Sir Archibald|1836|p=765}}{{sfn|Scott, Franklin D.|1962|p=284}}\n\nAfter the Battle of Jena, Bernadotte crushed the Prussian Reserve Army, all fresh troops fortified behind a marsh and the River Saale, under [[Duke Eugen of W\u00fcrttemberg (1758\u20131822)|Duke Eugen of W\u00fcrttemberg]] at [[Battle of Halle|Halle]] (17 October 1806), though Imperial Headquarters did not much appreciate this victory.<ref>Barton, Dunbar Plunket (1930). p. 193</ref> When visiting Halle after the battle, and commenting on the degree of difficulty of storming a fortified position accessible only by a single bridge, Napoleon enigmatically commented \"Bernadotte stops at nothing.

Bernadotte, struggling desperately to prevent his men from sacking, was given six horses from the Council of L\u00fcbeck as their appreciation.<ref>Barton, Dunbar Plunket (1930). pp. 198\u201399</ref><ref>Palmer, Alan (1990). pp. 132\u201337</ref> He also treated captured Swedish soldiers with courtesy and allowed them to return to their home country. The impressed Swedes went home with a tale of Bernadotte's fairness in maintaining order within the city.<ref>Palmer, Alan (1990). pp. 136\u201337</ref>\n\nThereafter he marched to Poland in command of the French Left Wing, composed of his I Corps and Ney's VI Corps. Left unsupported by Ney's unexpected movement toward [[K\u00f6nigsberg]], the Russians under [[Levin August von Bennigsen]], passed over to the offensive and attempted to destroy Bernadotte's and Ney's isolated Corps.<ref>Barton, D. Plunkett (1921) pp. 172\u201376</ref> Napoleon, having received word of the Russian offensive, gave word to Bernadotte to retreat West as to draw the Russians toward him so that Napoleon could then cut-off and surround the Russians. Bernadotte moved West as ordered, pursued by Bennigsen where he ably defeated the numerically superior Russian vanguard at [[Battle of Mohrungen|Mohrungen]] (25 January 1807).{{sfn|The American Cyclop\u00e6dia |1879|p=571}} Due to the capture of a courier carrying the Emperor's latest orders, Bernadotte was not informed of a change of strategy to move East toward the rest of the French Army. As a consequence, Bernadotte's I Corps was too far away to take part in the [[Battle of Eylau]] (7 to 8 February 1807). Napoleon rebuked him for his absence but it became acknowledged that it was not due to Bernadotte, but Berthier's carelessness in dispatching the orderly.<ref>Palmer, Alan (1990). pp. 140\u201341</ref> The Russians resumed the offensive that summer and Bernadotte was attacked by, and defeated, a strong Prussian Corps at  [[Battle of Guttstadt-Deppen|Spanden]], preserving the French bridgehead over the [[Pas\u0142\u0119ka]], where he was nearly killed when a spent ball struck him in the neck.<ref>Barton, D. Plunkett (1921) pp. 178\u201383</ref> Due to this near fatal wound, Bernadotte was invalided to the rear and missed the remainder of the Polish Campaign.\n\nAfter the [[Peace of Tilsit]], in 1808, as well-liked governor of the [[Hanseatic League|Hanseatic towns]], where he once again proved his administrative and diplomatic abilities,<ref>Barton, pp. 197\u2013201</ref> he was to direct the expedition against Sweden, via the [[Denmark|Danish]] islands, but the plan came to naught because of the want of transports and the defection of the [[Division of the North|Spanish contingent]].{{sfn|Bain|1911|p=931}} Pursuant to the projected invasion of Sweden, and by virtue of Denmark becoming an ally of France in 1808, Bernadotte found himself de facto head of a French occupation of Denmark. However, Bernadotte maintained strict discipline amongst his troops and his good treatment of the Danes made him popular with the populace and Danish Royal Family. Upon his departure from Denmark he was one of few Frenchmen of the period to be awarded the [[Order of the Elephant]].<ref>Barton, pp. 194\u201396</ref>\n\nDuring Bernadotte's time as governor of the Hanseatic cities, the [[Abdications of Bayonne]] occurred, an event that triggered the [[Peninsular War]] that would play so large a role in Napoleon's defeat. For a time Napoleon considered the notion of placing Bernadotte on the Spanish throne; going so far as to hint at it in a letter to him. However, Bernadotte made it known to Napoleon that he didn't want the Spanish Crown.<ref>Barton, D. Plunkett (1921) pp. 192\u201393.</ref> [[Joseph Bonaparte]], Bernadotte's friend and brother-in-law, was chosen instead. It was not the first, or last time, that Napoleon thought of placing Bernadotte on a foreign throne. Indeed, Napoleon on several occasions, both during his days as First Consul and then as Emperor, thought of naming Bernadotte (Napoleon also considered Murat) as his successor by adoption. Despite their rivalry, Napoleon felt that Bernadotte alone had the popularity, administrative and military skill to safeguard the Empire he had built. However, the birth of the [[Napoleon II|King of Rome]] put an end to Napoleon's need for an heir.<ref>Ibid. p. 209.</ref> Ironically, Bernadotte did eventually wear a crown, not through the auspices of Napoleon, but as an enemy of France.<ref>Ibid, pp. 192\u201395</ref>\n\nBeing recalled to Germany to assist in the new war between France and Austria, he received the command of the 9th Corps, which was mainly composed of [[Saxony|Saxons]].{{sfn|The American Cyclop\u00e6dia |1879|p=571}}  Further difficulties with Berthier, and being saddled with ill-prepared Saxons, combined with an illness, compelled Bernadotte to beg for release from service.{{sfn|Scott, Franklin D.|1962|p=284}} Bernadotte wrote to Napoleon that \"I see my efforts perpetually paralyzed by a hidden force over which I can not prevail.\"{{sfn|Barton, Sir Dunbar Plunket |1930|pp=216\u201317}} Napoleon disregarded these appeals and Bernadotte proceeded with the campaign, commanding mostly foreign troops with few French troops under his command.{{sfn|Scott, Franklin D.|1962|pp=284\u201385}}\nAt the [[Battle of Wagram]] (5 July 1809), he entered battle with his Saxon corps, to which the division of [[Pierre-Louis Dupas|Dupas]] was attached and which formed his reserve. Resting on the French Left, Bernadotte's corps was battered during the night but resisted the full fury of the Austrian attack facing superior numbers. At a critical moment he ordered Dupas forward to his support; the latter replied that he had orders from the emperor to remain where he was. Having been badly mauled, and fully exposed ahead of the main French line, IX Corps withdrew from the village of Aderklaa against Napoleon's orders. On the second day of battle, 6 July 1809, IX Corps, having been mauled the night before, wherein Bernadotte struggled to rally his demoralized Saxons, was attacked by two Austrian corps, as part of [[Archduke Charles, Duke of Teschen|Archduke Charles's]] effort to break the French line. This time Bernadotte's depleted forces - he had only 6,000 infantry left - broke and fled (Bernadotte's Corps was not the only one to have broken that day, Mass\u00e9na's troops were also routed by the attack). The routed Saxons retreated in disorder toward Raasdorf as Bernadotte attempted to rally his men, where he encountered Napoleon. IX Corps rallied and played a further role in the battle. Rumors that Napoleon relieved Bernadotte of command on the spot at Raasdorf have long been the stuff of legend, but are not verified.<ref>Barton, D. Plunkett (1921). pp. 223\u201325.</ref> After the battle, Bernadotte complained to Napoleon for having, in violation of all military rules, ordered Dupas to act independently of his command, and for having thereby caused great loss of life to the Saxons, and tendered his resignation. Napoleon accepted after he had become aware of an order of the day issued by Bernadotte in which he gave the Saxons credit for their courage in terms inconsistent with the emperor's official bulletin.{{sfn|The American Cyclop\u00e6dia |1879|p=571}} Accounts of Bernadotte's role at Wagram are contradictory. While it is true that IX Corps broke on 6 July, as did other French formations, they later rallied and played a part in the victory. Moreover, Bernadotte fought with exceptional personal courage, at the head of his troops, and narrowly averted death when attacked by Austrian cavalry. It is likely that IX Corps' poor performance would have been forgotten, and Bernadotte would have retained his command, had he never published the controversial Order of the Day.<ref>Barton, D. Plunkett (1921). pp. 227\u201328.</ref> However, Bernadotte's praise for the Saxons, as well as his mild and courteous treatment of them while under his command, was never forgotten by the Saxon officers and this would later have disastrous consequences for the French when a whole Saxon division defected to Bernadotte's Army of the North during a key moment of the [[Battle of Leipzig]].<ref>Smith, Digby (2001). pp. 225\u201329</ref>\n\nWith Bernadotte having returned to Paris, the [[Walcheren Campaign]] (July 1809) caused the French ministry in the absence of the emperor to entrust him with the defense of [[Antwerp]] with both regular French and Dutch troops along with the [[National Guard (France)|National Guard]].<ref>Palmer, Alan (1990). p. 153</ref> Bernadotte, with his customary skill, took command of a chaotic situation wherein troops from all over the Empire and its vassal states, and raw conscripts, were sent to Holland under divided command. He re-organized and trained his forces, named by the Emperor as the Army of Antwerp, by instilling discipline in old soldiers too long at the depots and teaching raw conscripts their trade. Everywhere he instilled a fighting spirit, making an army out of a mob, and thus he rapidly brought the defenses of Antwerp to a high order of readiness.<ref>Barton, Plunkett (1921). pp. 237\u201340</ref> With Antwerp bristling with cannon and numerous defenders, and with the Army of Antwerp whipped into fighting shape, the British, vexed by poor leadership and with half the army immobilized with fever thanks to the insalubrious islands upon which they were quartered, realized that it was no longer possible to close the [[Scheldt]], or take Antwerp, and withdrew their forces.<ref>Howard, Martin (2012). pp. 139\u201347.</ref> In a proclamation issued to his troops at Antwerp he made an implied charge against Napoleon of having neglected to prepare the proper means of defense for the Belgian coast. A displeased Napoleon relieved Bernadotte of command of his ad-hoc army, and ordered his return to Paris to leave for Catalonia and take command of the Army there.<ref>Palmer, Alan( 1990). pp. 153\u201354</ref><ref>Favier, Franck (2010). p. 158</ref> Refusing to comply with the order, he was summoned to Vienna, and after an interview with Napoleon at [[Sch\u00f6nbrunn Palace|Sch\u00f6nbrunn]] accepted the general government of the Roman states.{{sfn|The American Cyclop\u00e6dia |1879|p=571}}\n\n==Offer of the Swedish throne==\n[[File:Statyn av Karl XIV Johan Norrk\u00f6ping april 2006.jpg|180px|thumb|Statue in [[Norrk\u00f6ping]] erected in 1846]]\nIn 1810 Bernadotte was about to enter his new post as governor of [[Rome]] when he was unexpectedly elected the heir-presumptive to King [[Charles XIII of Sweden|Charles XIII]] of [[Sweden]].{{sfn|Bain|1911|p=932}} The problem of Charles' successor had been acute almost from the time he had ascended the throne a year earlier, as it was apparent that the Swedish branch of the House of Holstein-Gottorp would die with him. He was 61 years old and in poor health. He was also childless; [[Hedvig Elisabeth Charlotte of Holstein-Gottorp|Queen Charlotte]] had given birth to two children who had died in infancy, and there was no prospect of her bearing another child. The king had adopted a Danish prince, [[Charles August, Crown Prince of Sweden|Charles August]], as his son soon after his coronation, but he had died just a few months after his arrival.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/107273/Charles-XIII|title=Charles XIII \u2013 king of Sweden|publisher=}}</ref> Despite the fact that Napoleon favored his ally Danish King Frederick VI, Danish Prince [[Frederick Christian II, Duke of Schleswig-Holstein-Sonderburg-Augustenburg|Frederick Christian]] initially had the most support to become Swedish Crown Prince as well.<ref name=norgoal>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=JSZ8CwAAQBAJ&pg=PA221&lpg=PA221&dq=napoleon+prince+charles+john#v=onepage&q=napoleon%20prince%20charles%20john&f=false|title=Napoleon's Empire: European Politics in Global Perspective|first=Ute|last=Planert|page=221|date= 2015|accessdate=27 December 2018|isbn=978-1137455475}}</ref>\n\nThe Swedish court initially sounded out the emperor for his preferences on candidates for crown prince, whereupon Napoleon made it clear he preferred his son-in-law [[Eug\u00e8ne de Beauharnais]], one of his nephews or one of his brothers. However, Eug\u00e8ne, serving as viceroy in Italy, did not wish to convert to Lutheranism, a prerequisite for accepting the Swedish offer. Moreover, none of Napoleon's brothers was interested in going to Sweden and his nephews were too young, as the Swedes did not want the hazards of minority rule in the event King Charles died prematurely.<ref>Barton, D. Plunkett (1921). pp. 250\u201356, 268\u201372.</ref> The matter was decided by an obscure Swedish courtier, son of Baron Gustav M\u00f6rner, a commander of the Swedish force captured by Bernadotte at L\u00fcbeck, Baron [[Karl Otto M\u00f6rner]], who, entirely on his own initiative, offered the succession to the Swedish crown to Bernadotte. Bernadotte communicated M\u00f6rner's offer to Napoleon who at first treated the situation as an absurdity, but later came around to the idea and diplomatically and financially supported Bernadotte's candidacy.<ref>Ibid. pp. 268\u201378.</ref>\n\nAlthough the [[Privy Council of Sweden|Swedish government]], amazed at M\u00f6rner's [[wikt:effrontery|effrontery]], at once placed him under arrest on his return to Sweden, the candidature of Bernadotte gradually gained favour and on 21 August 1810{{sfn|Bain|1911|p=932}} he was elected by the [[Riksdag of the Estates]] in [[\u00d6rebro]] to be the new [[Crown Prince|crown prince]],{{sfn|Bain|1911|p=932}} and was subsequently made [[Generalissimus]] of the [[Swedish Armed Forces]] by the king.<ref>{{cite book |year=1813 |title=Anciennet\u00e9 och Rang-Rulla \u00f6fver Krigsmagten \u00e5r 1813 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=4sN1NQEACAAJ |page= |language=Sv}}</ref>{{page needed|date=June 2014}} Bernadotte was elected partly because a large part of the [[Swedish Army]], in view of future complications with [[Russia]], were in favour of electing a soldier, and partly because he was also personally popular, owing to the kindness he had shown to the Swedish prisoners in L\u00fcbeck.<ref>Favier, Franck (2010). p. 12</ref> Another factor which favored Bernadotte's election was his (presumed) close ties to French Emperor [[Napoleon Bonaparte]],<ref name=napoleonrevealed /> who had recently defeated Sweden in the [[Franco-Swedish War]].<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=BPoLAQAAIAAJ&pg=PA473&lpg=PA473&dq=france+captures+swedish+pomerania+1810#v=onepage&q=france%20captures%20swedish%20pomerania%201810&f=false|title=Epitome of Ancient, Mediaeval and Modern History|page=473|author=Carl Ploetz|date=1911|accessdate=26 December 2018}}</ref>\n\nBefore freeing Bernadotte from his allegiance to France, Napoleon asked him to agree never to take up arms against France.

The keynote of his whole policy was the acquisition of Norway as a compensation for the loss of Finland and Bernadotte proved anything but a puppet of France.{{sfn|Bain|1911|p=932}} Many Swedes expected him to reconquer Finland, which had been ceded to Russia; however, the Crown Prince was aware of its difficulty for reasons of the desperate situation of the state finance and the reluctance of the Finnish people to return to Sweden.<ref>Berdah, Jean-Francois (2009). p. 39</ref> Even if Finland was regained, he thought, it would put Sweden into a new cycle of conflicts with a powerful neighbor because there was no guarantee Russia would accept the loss as final.<ref>Palmer, Alan (1990). p. 181</ref> Therefore, he made up his mind to make a united [[Scandinavian Peninsula|Scandinavian peninsula]], which was easier to defend, by taking Norway (intentionally without the ancient and remote provinces of [[Greenland]], [[Iceland]] and the [[Faroe Islands]]) from Denmark and uniting her to Sweden. He tried to divert public opinion from Finland to Norway, by arguing that to create a compact peninsula, with sea for its natural boundary, was to inaugurate an era of peace, and that waging war with Russia would lead to ruinous consequences.<ref>Barton, Sir Dunbar Plunket (1930). pp. 257\u201358</ref>\n\nSoon after Charles John's arrival in Sweden, Napoleon compelled him to accede to the [[Continental System]] and declare war against Great Britain; otherwise, Sweden would have to face the determination of France, Denmark and Russia. This demand would mean a hard blow to the national economy and the Swedish population. Sweden reluctantly declared war against Great Britain but it was treated by both countries as being merely nominal, although Swedish imports of British goods decreased from \u00a34,871 million in 1810 to \u00a3523 million in the following year.<ref>Berdah, Jean-Francois (2009). pp. 40\u201341</ref><ref>Barton, Sir Dunbar Plunket (1930). p. 259</ref>\n\nIn January 1812, French troops suddenly invaded [[Swedish Pomerania]] and the [[island of R\u00fcgen]].<ref>Barton, Sir Dunbar Plunket (1930). p. 265</ref> The decisive reason was that Napoleon, before marching to Moscow, had to secure his rear and dared not trust a Swedish continental foothold behind him.<ref name=\"Scott, Franklin D.1988.

Bernadotte's Army of the North would continue to guard Berlin and keep watch on Davout's forces in Hamburg while the Allies, in accordance with the plan conceived at [[Trachenberg Plan|Trachenberg]], maneuvered toward Napoleon's army at Leipzig. With the other Allied armies engaged in battle on 17 October, Bernadotte's army finally crossed the Elbe and joined in the [[Battle of Leipzig]] on 19 October. His fresh troops, reinforced by 30,000 Prussians, joined the fray against the already battered French lines where Swedish forces entered battle in numbers for the first time in the campaign. At a critical moment an entire Saxon division went over to his army in response to a proclamation released a week prior  in which Bernadotte invited the Saxons to join their old commander in defeating Napoleon.<ref>Barton, Dunbar (1925). p. 94,</ref> The Army of the North committed the ''coup de gr\u00e2ce'' on the already depleted French and Bernadotte was the first of the Allied sovereigns to enter Leipzig.<ref>Ibid, pp. 101\u201308.</ref>\n\nAfter the [[Battle of Leipzig]] he went his own way, determined at all hazards to cripple Denmark and to [[Norway in 1814|secure Norway]],{{sfn|Bain|1911|p=932}}  defeating the Danes in [[Battle of Bornh\u00f6ved (1813)|a relatively quick campaign]].

Ultimately the British and Austrians vetoed the idea, and the Allies agreed that if Napoleon were to be deposed, the only acceptable alternative was the restoration of the [[House of Bourbon]].\n\n==King of Sweden and Norway==\n[[File:Kroning 1818 s.JPG|thumb|right|218px|Coronation of Karl III Johan as King of Norway in [[Nidaros Cathedral]], Trondheim]]\nCharles John had been regent and ''de facto'' head of state upon his arrival, and took an increasing role in government from 1812 onward, with Charles XIII reduced to a mute witness in government councils following a stroke.\n\nUpon Charles' death on 5 February 1818, Charles John ascended as the union King, reigning as Charles XIV John in Sweden and Charles III John in Norway.

The Norwegian constitution gave the Norwegian parliament, the [[Storting]], more power than any legislature in Europe.  While Charles John had the power of absolute veto in Sweden, he only had a suspensive veto in Norway.

The construction began in 1825, but the [[Storting]] halted the funding after the costly foundation was laid and demanded that the appointed architect, [[Hans Linstow]], construct a simpler palace. This was seen by many as a protest against unnecessary spending and the king's authority. The palace itself was not completed until 1849, long after the death of Charles John, and was inaugurated by [[Oscar I of Sweden|Oscar I]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.kongehuset.no/artikkel.html?tid=33470&sek=33469|title=History of the Royal Palace|website=www.kongehuset.no|language=no|access-date=14 August 2018}}</ref> The main street in Oslo, ''Slottsgate''n, would later be named after Charles John as [[Karl Johans gate]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.kongehuset.no/artikkel.html?tid=28686|title=King Carl Johan (1763\u20131844)|website=www.kongehuset.no|language=no|access-date=14 August 2018}}</ref>\n\nHis popularity decreased for a time in the 1830s, culminating in the [[Rabulist riots]] after the [[L\u00e8se-majest\u00e9]] conviction of the journalist [[Magnus Jacob Crusenstolpe]], and some calls for his abdication.<ref name=Britannica/> Charles John survived the abdication controversy and he went on to have his [[silver jubilee]], which was celebrated with great enthusiasm on 18 February 1843.

Following the outbreak of the [[French Revolution]], he exhibited great military talent, rapidly rising through the ranks and was made a [[brigadier general]] by 1794. He served with distinction in Italy and Germany, and was briefly Minister of War. His relationship with [[Napoleon]] was turbulent; nevertheless, Napoleon named him a [[Marshal of the Empire]] on the proclamation of the [[First French Empire|French Empire]]. Bernadotte played a significant role in the French victory at [[Battle of Austerlitz|Austerlitz]], and was made [[Principality of Pontecorvo|Prince of Pontecorvo]] as a reward.\n\nIn 1810, Bernadotte was unexpectedly elected the [[heir-presumptive]] to the childless King [[Charles XIII of Sweden]], thanks to the advocacy of Baron [[Carl Otto M\u00f6rner]], a Swedish courtier and obscure member of the [[Riksdag of the Estates]].{{sfn|Cronholm|1902|pp=249\u201371}} He assumed the name Charles John and became the ''[[de facto]]'' regent and head of state. In 1813, following the sudden unprovoked French invasion of [[Swedish Pomerania]], Crown Prince Charles John aligned Sweden with Napoleon's enemies in the [[War of the Sixth Coalition|Sixth Coalition]], wherein he authored the Allied campaign plan, and commanded the Allied Army of the North that made the decisive attack on the last day of the catastrophic French defeat at [[Battle of Leipzig|Leipzig]]. He went on to defeat Denmark and forced Norway into a [[Union between Sweden and Norway|union with Sweden]].\n\nUpon the death of [[Charles XIII of Sweden|Charles XIII]] in 1818, Charles John ascended to the throne as the first monarch from the [[House of Bernadotte]]. He presided over a period of peace and prosperity, and reigned until his death in 1844.\n\n==Early life and family==\n[[File:Pau Bernadotte.JPG|100px|thumb|left|Bernadotte's birthplace in [[Pau, Pyr\u00e9n\u00e9es-Atlantiques|Pau]], France]]\nBernadotte was born in [[Pau, Pyr\u00e9n\u00e9es-Atlantiques|Pau]], France, as the son of Jean Henri Bernadotte (1711\u20131780), [[prosecutor]] at Pau, and his wife (married at [[Boeil-Bezing|Boeil]], 20 February 1754) Jeanne de Saint-Jean (1728\u20131809), [[niece]] of the [[Lay Abbot]] of [[Sireix]]. The family name was originally du Poey (or de Pouey), but was changed to Bernadotte\u2014a surname of an ancestress at the beginning of the 17th century.{{sfn|Bain|1911|p=931}} Soon after his birth, Baptiste was added to his name, to distinguish him from his elder brother Jean \u00c9vangeliste. Bernadotte himself added Jules to his first names as a tribute to the French Empire under [[Napoleon I]].{{sfn|Bain|1911|p=931}}\n\nAt the age of 14, he was apprenticed to a local attorney. However, the death of his father when Bernadotte was just 17 stopped the youth from following his father's career.<ref>Palmer, Alan (1990). p. 6</ref>\n\n==Early military career==\nBernadotte joined the army as a private in the [[R\u00e9giment Royal\u2013La Marine]] on 3 September 1780,<ref>Barton, Dunbar Plunket (1930). p. 5</ref> and first served in the newly conquered territory of [[Corsica]].{{sfn|Bain|1911|p=931}} Subsequently, the R\u00e9giment stationed in [[Besan\u00e7on]], [[Grenoble]], [[Vienne]], [[Marseille]] and [[\u00cele de R\u00e9]].<ref>Palmer, Alan (1990). pp. 8\u201313</ref><ref>Barton, Dunbar Plunket (1930). p. 14</ref> He reached the rank of sergeant in August 1785 and was nicknamed ''Sergeant Belle-Jambe'', for his smart appearance.<ref>Barton, Dunbar Plunket (1930). p. 11</ref> In early 1790 he was promoted to [[Adjudant-Major]], the highest rank for [[non-commissioned officer]]s in the Ancien R\u00e9gime.<ref>Palmer, Alan (1990). p. 15</ref>\n\n==Revolutionary Wars==\nFollowing the outbreak of the [[French Revolution]], his eminent military qualities brought him speedy promotion.{{sfn|Bain|1911|p=931}} Bernadotte's promotions came both from the esteem of his commanders as well as from his men; having been elected to the rank of lieutenant colonel and colonel by his men, though he refused both nominations in favor of traditional advancement.<ref>Barton, Dunbar Plunket (1914). ''Bernadotte: The First Phase''. pp. 50\u201352, 70\u201371.</ref>\n\nIt was during this period of rapid advancement that the military qualities he became known for, daring assaults and Gasconades, came to the fore. Of the latter, Bernadotte was gifted in his ability to inspire his men to prodigious feats of valor. As Colonel and commander of the 71st Demi-Brigade, Bernadotte rallied his men, who were retreating in disorder before an Austrian attack, by tearing off his epaulettes, throwing them to the ground before his men and shouting \u201cIf you dishonor yourselves by flight, I refuse to remain your colonel!\u201d Soldiers left the ranks, gathered his epaulettes, pressed them into his hands, formed ranks and reformed the line and counter-attacked.<ref>Ibid, pp. 76\u201377.</ref>\n\nBy 1794 he was promoted to brigadier, attached to the [[Army of Sambre-et-Meuse]].{{sfn|Bain|1911|p=931}} After [[Jean-Baptiste Jourdan|Jourdan]]'s victory at [[Battle of Fleurus (1794)|Fleurus]] (26 June 1794), where he distinguished himself with a decisive attack and seizure of key terrain that led to the Austrian retreat, he then became a divisional general.<ref>Barton, Dunbar Plunket (1914). ''Bernadotte: The First Phase''. pp. 92\u201394</ref>\n\nBernadotte played key roles throughout the next 18 months during the three French invasions into Germany; often employed in the place of honor during offensives leading the vanguard, and in retreat as a defensive specialist commanding the rearguard.<ref>Ibid. pp. 98\u2013101</ref>\n\nAt the [[Battle of Theiningen]] (1796), Bernadotte contributed, more than anyone else, to the successful retreat of the French army over the [[Rhine]] after its defeat by the [[Archduke Charles of Austria]].<ref>Ibid. pp. 110\u201314.</ref>\n\nAt the beginning of 1797 he was ordered by the Directory to march with 20,000 men as reinforcements to [[Napoleon Bonaparte]]'s army in Italy.{{sfn|The American Cyclop\u00e6dia |1879|p=571}} His successful crossing of the Alps through the storm in midwinter was highly praised but coldly received by the Italian Army.<ref>Barton, Dunbar Plunket (1930). p. 42</ref><ref>Palmer, Alan (1990). p. 42</ref> Upon receiving insult from [[Dominique Martin Dupuy]], the commander of Milan, Bernadotte was to arrest him for insubordination.<ref>Palmer, Alan (1990). pp. 42\u201343</ref> However, Dupuy was a close friend of [[Louis-Alexandre Berthier]] and this started a long-lasting feud between Bernadotte and Napoleon's Chief of Staff.<ref>Barton, Dunbar Plunket (1930). p. 44</ref>\n\nHe had his first interview with Napoleon in Mantua and was appointed the commander of the 4th division.<ref>Palmer, Alan (1990). p. 43</ref> During the invasion of Friuli and Istria, Bernadotte distinguished himself greatly at the passage of the [[Tagliamento]] where he led the vanguard, and at the capture of the fortress of Gradisca (19 March 1797).{{sfn|The American Cyclop\u00e6dia |1879|p=571}} After the [[Coup of 18 Fructidor|18th Fructidor]], Napoleon ordered his generals to collect from their respective divisions' addresses in favor of the coup d'\u00e9tat of that day; but Bernadotte sent an address to the directory different from that which Napoleon wished for and without conveying it through Napoleon's hands.{{sfn|The American Cyclop\u00e6dia |1879|p=571}}\n\nAfter the [[treaty of Campo Formio]], Napoleon gave Bernadotte a friendly visit at his headquarters at Udine, but immediately after deprived him of half his division of the army of the Rhine, and commanded him to march the other half back to France.{{sfn|The American Cyclop\u00e6dia |1879|p=571}} [[Paul Barras]], one of five directors, was cautious that Napoleon would overturn the Republic, so he appointed Bernadotte commander-in-chief of the Italian Army in order to offset Napoleon's power.<ref>Palmer, Alan (1990). pp. 60\u201361</ref> Bernadotte was pleased with this appointment but Napoleon lobbied [[Charles Maurice de Talleyrand-P\u00e9rigord|Talleyrand-P\u00e9rigord]], the Minister of Foreign Affairs, to appoint him to the embassy of [[Vienna]] instead.<ref>Palmer, Alan (1990). p. 61</ref> Bernadotte was very dissatisfied; he finally accepted the post in Vienna, but had to quit owing to the disturbances caused by his hoisting the [[Flag of France|tricolour]] over the [[embassy]].{{sfn|Bain|1911|p=931}}{{sfn|The American Cyclop\u00e6dia |1879|p=571}}\n\nAfter returning from Vienna, he resided in Paris. He married [[D\u00e9sir\u00e9e Clary]] in August 1798, the daughter of a Marseilles merchant and [[Joseph Bonaparte]]'s sister-in-law.{{sfn|The American Cyclop\u00e6dia |1879|p=571}} In November of the same year he was made commander of the army of observation on the upper Rhine. Although solicited to do so by Barras and Joseph Bonaparte, he did not take part in [[Coup of 30 Prairial VII|the coup d'\u00e9tat of the 30th Prairial]].<ref>Palmer, Alan (1990). p. 84</ref> From 2 July to 14 September he was [[List of Defence Ministers of France|Minister of War]], in which capacity he displayed great ability.{{sfn|The American Cyclop\u00e6dia |1879|p=571}} However, his popularity and contacts with radical Jacobins aroused antipathy towards him in the government.<ref>Palmer, Alan (1990). p. 88</ref> On the morning of 13 September he found his resignation announced in the Moniteur before he was aware that he had tendered it. This was a trick; played upon him by [[Emmanuel Joseph Siey\u00e8s|Siey\u00e8s]] and [[Roger Ducos]], the directors allied to Napoleon.{{sfn|The American Cyclop\u00e6dia |1879|p=571}}\n\nHe declined to help Napoleon Bonaparte stage his [[Coup of 18 Brumaire|''coup d'\u00e9tat'' of November 1799]] but nevertheless accepted employment from the [[French Consulate|Consulate]], and from April 1800 to 18 August 1801 Commander-in-Chief of the Army of the West, in the rebellious [[Vend\u00e9e]], and successfully restored its tranquility.{{sfn|Bain|1911|p=931}}{{sfn|The American Cyclop\u00e6dia |1879|p=571}}\n\nIn 1802, Napoleon Bonaparte proposed that Bernadotte head to New France to serve as governor of [[Louisiana]], which was to be transferred back to French control following the [[Third Treaty of San Ildefonso]]. In accepting the position, Bernadotte requested additional soldiers, settlers, and funding to support the colony, but Napoleon refused. In response, Bernadotte, declined the posting and instead was named plenipotentiary ambassador to the United States. His posting was cancelled, however, after the [[Louisiana Purchase|Sale of Louisiana]].<ref>{{cite conference | url = https://hal.archives-ouvertes.fr/hal-00974220/document | title = Bernadotte, Bonaparte, and Louisiana: the last dream of a French Empire in North America | first = Jean-Marc | last = Olivier | date = 2010 | editor-last = Belaubre | editor-first = Christope | editor-last2 = Dym | editor-first2 = Jordana | editor-last3 = Savage | editor-first3 = John | book-title = Napoleon's Atlantic: The Impact of Napoleonic Empire in the Atlantic World | publisher = Brill | location = Leiden, Netherlands | pages = 141\u201350 | format = PDF | isbn = 978-9004181540 | access-date = 11 November 2018 }}</ref>\n\n==Marshal of the French Empire==\n[[File:Jean-Baptiste Jules Bernadotte.jpg|180px|thumbnail|left|Bernadotte as a Marshal of the Empire]]On the introduction of the [[First French Empire]], Bernadotte became one of the eighteen [[Marshal of the Empire|Marshals of the Empire]], and from June 1804 to September 1805 served as governor of the recently occupied [[Hanover]]. In this capacity, as well as during his later command of the army of northern Germany, he created for himself a reputation for independence, incorruptibility, moderation, and administrative ability.{{sfn|The American Cyclop\u00e6dia |1879|p=571}}\n\nDuring the campaign of 1805, Bernadotte, with his army corps from Hanover formed into the I Corps, commanded the Left Wing of the Grand Army overseeing Marmont's II Corps and having the majority of the Bavarian Army attached to his command; some 65,000 men or 1/4th of the Army. Bernadotte was also tasked with assuring France's newest ally, the Elector of Bavaria, [[Maximilian_I_Joseph_of_Bavaria|Maximillian Joseph]], that the Austrians would be driven from his country.<ref>Maude, F.A (1912) pp. 150-151</ref><ref>Barton, D. Plunkett (1921) pp. 106-109</ref>\n\nBernadotte, with Davout's III Corps attached to his command, and the Bavarians, gained a victory over the Austrians driving them out of Munich on October 12th, taking some 3000 prisoners and 19 guns and installing Maximillian Joseph back onto his throne.<ref>Barton, D. Plunkett (1921) pp. 108-109</ref> I Corps then co-operated in the great movement which resulted in the shutting off of [[Karl Mack von Leiberich|Mack]] in the Battle of [[Battle of Ulm|Ulm]].

In pursuance of these orders, Bernadotte, separately from Davout, left Naumburg at dawn on the morning of the 14th for [[Dornburg]] and marched towards [[Apolda]], which he reached by 16:00. Hampered by the very poor state of the roads, he could not engage in the Battle of Jena, though he effectively compelled the Prussians to retreat from both battlefields by posting his troops on the heights of Apolda.{{sfn|Titeux, Eugene|1903|pp=86\u2013104}}{{sfn|Foucart, Paul Jean|1887|pp=694\u201397}}{{sfn|Alison, Sir Archibald|1836|pp=758, 764\u201365}}\nAfterwards, Bernadotte was accused of deliberately refusing to support Davout, who had unexpectedly encountered the Prussian main army at Auerst\u00e4dt, out of jealousy, and Napoleon, if reminiscences from St. Helena may be believed, once intended to put Bernadotte before a court-martial.{{sfn|Favier, Franck|2010|pp=137\u201339}}{{sfn|Palmer, Alan|1990|p=135}} In fact, he did what he had been ordered to do, and more fundamental responsibility for his absence rests upon the ambiguous and indirect orders issued by Berthier and Napoleon's unawareness of the Prussian position.{{sfn|Alison, Sir Archibald|1836|p=765}}{{sfn|Scott, Franklin D.|1962|p=284}}\n\nAfter the Battle of Jena, Bernadotte crushed the Prussian Reserve Army, all fresh troops fortified behind a marsh and the River Saale, under [[Duke Eugen of W\u00fcrttemberg (1758\u20131822)|Duke Eugen of W\u00fcrttemberg]] at [[Battle of Halle|Halle]] (17 October 1806), though Imperial Headquarters did not much appreciate this victory.<ref>Barton, Dunbar Plunket (1930). p. 193</ref> When visiting Halle after the battle, and commenting on the degree of difficulty of storming a fortified position accessible only by a single bridge, Napoleon enigmatically commented \"Bernadotte stops at nothing.

Plunkett (1921) pp. 172\u201376</ref> Napoleon, having received word of the Russian offensive, gave word to Bernadotte to retreat West as to draw the Russians toward him so that Napoleon could then cut-off and surround the Russians.

As a consequence, Bernadotte's I Corps was too far away to take part in the [[Battle of Eylau]] (7 to 8 February 1807). Napoleon rebuked him for his absence but it became acknowledged that it was not due to Bernadotte, but Berthier's carelessness in dispatching the orderly.<ref>Palmer, Alan (1990). pp. 140\u201341</ref> The Russians resumed the offensive that summer and Bernadotte was attacked by, and defeated, a strong Prussian Corps at  [[Battle of Guttstadt-Deppen|Spanden]], preserving the French bridgehead over the [[Pas\u0142\u0119ka]], where he was nearly killed when a spent ball struck him in the neck.<ref>Barton, D.

However, Bernadotte maintained strict discipline amongst his troops and his good treatment of the Danes made him popular with the populace and Danish Royal Family. Upon his departure from Denmark he was one of few Frenchmen of the period to be awarded the [[Order of the Elephant]].<ref>Barton, pp. 194\u201396</ref>\n\nDuring Bernadotte's time as governor of the Hanseatic cities, the [[Abdications of Bayonne]] occurred, an event that triggered the [[Peninsular War]] that would play so large a role in Napoleon's defeat. For a time Napoleon considered the notion of placing Bernadotte on the Spanish throne; going so far as to hint at it in a letter to him. However, Bernadotte made it known to Napoleon that he didn't want the Spanish Crown.<ref>Barton, D. Plunkett (1921) pp. 192\u201393.</ref> [[Joseph Bonaparte]], Bernadotte's friend and brother-in-law, was chosen instead. It was not the first, or last time, that Napoleon thought of placing Bernadotte on a foreign throne. Indeed, Napoleon on several occasions, both during his days as First Consul and then as Emperor, thought of naming Bernadotte (Napoleon also considered Murat) as his successor by adoption. Despite their rivalry, Napoleon felt that Bernadotte alone had the popularity, administrative and military skill to safeguard the Empire he had built. However, the birth of the [[Napoleon II|King of Rome]] put an end to Napoleon's need for an heir.<ref>Ibid. p. 209.</ref> Ironically, Bernadotte did eventually wear a crown, not through the auspices of Napoleon, but as an enemy of France.<ref>Ibid, pp. 192\u201395</ref>\n\nBeing recalled to Germany to assist in the new war between France and Austria, he received the command of the 9th Corps, which was mainly composed of [[Saxony|Saxons]].{{sfn|The American Cyclop\u00e6dia |1879|p=571}}  Further difficulties with Berthier, and being saddled with ill-prepared Saxons, combined with an illness, compelled Bernadotte to beg for release from service.{{sfn|Scott, Franklin D.|1962|p=284}} Bernadotte wrote to Napoleon that \"I see my efforts perpetually paralyzed by a hidden force over which I can not prevail.\"{{sfn|Barton, Sir Dunbar Plunket |1930|pp=216\u201317}} Napoleon disregarded these appeals and Bernadotte proceeded with the campaign, commanding mostly foreign troops with few French troops under his command.{{sfn|Scott, Franklin D.|1962|pp=284\u201385}}\nAt the [[Battle of Wagram]] (5 July 1809), he entered battle with his Saxon corps, to which the division of [[Pierre-Louis Dupas|Dupas]] was attached and which formed his reserve. Resting on the French Left, Bernadotte's corps was battered during the night but resisted the full fury of the Austrian attack facing superior numbers. At a critical moment he ordered Dupas forward to his support; the latter replied that he had orders from the emperor to remain where he was. Having been badly mauled, and fully exposed ahead of the main French line, IX Corps withdrew from the village of Aderklaa against Napoleon's orders. On the second day of battle, 6 July 1809, IX Corps, having been mauled the night before, wherein Bernadotte struggled to rally his demoralized Saxons, was attacked by two Austrian corps, as part of [[Archduke Charles, Duke of Teschen|Archduke Charles's]] effort to break the French line. This time Bernadotte's depleted forces - he had only 6,000 infantry left - broke and fled (Bernadotte's Corps was not the only one to have broken that day, Mass\u00e9na's troops were also routed by the attack). The routed Saxons retreated in disorder toward Raasdorf as Bernadotte attempted to rally his men, where he encountered Napoleon. IX Corps rallied and played a further role in the battle. Rumors that Napoleon relieved Bernadotte of command on the spot at Raasdorf have long been the stuff of legend, but are not verified.<ref>Barton, D. Plunkett (1921). pp. 223\u201325.</ref> After the battle, Bernadotte complained to Napoleon for having, in violation of all military rules, ordered Dupas to act independently of his command, and for having thereby caused great loss of life to the Saxons, and tendered his resignation. Napoleon accepted after he had become aware of an order of the day issued by Bernadotte in which he gave the Saxons credit for their courage in terms inconsistent with the emperor's official bulletin.{{sfn|The American Cyclop\u00e6dia |1879|p=571}} Accounts of Bernadotte's role at Wagram are contradictory. While it is true that IX Corps broke on 6 July, as did other French formations, they later rallied and played a part in the victory. Moreover, Bernadotte fought with exceptional personal courage, at the head of his troops, and narrowly averted death when attacked by Austrian cavalry. It is likely that IX Corps' poor performance would have been forgotten, and Bernadotte would have retained his command, had he never published the controversial Order of the Day.<ref>Barton, D. Plunkett (1921). pp. 227\u201328.</ref> However, Bernadotte's praise for the Saxons, as well as his mild and courteous treatment of them while under his command, was never forgotten by the Saxon officers and this would later have disastrous consequences for the French when a whole Saxon division defected to Bernadotte's Army of the North during a key moment of the [[Battle of Leipzig]].<ref>Smith, Digby (2001). pp. 225\u201329</ref>\n\nWith Bernadotte having returned to Paris, the [[Walcheren Campaign]] (July 1809) caused the French ministry in the absence of the emperor to entrust him with the defense of [[Antwerp]] with both regular French and Dutch troops along with the [[National Guard (France)|National Guard]].<ref>Palmer, Alan (1990). p. 153</ref> Bernadotte, with his customary skill, took command of a chaotic situation wherein troops from all over the Empire and its vassal states, and raw conscripts, were sent to Holland under divided command. He re-organized and trained his forces, named by the Emperor as the Army of Antwerp, by instilling discipline in old soldiers too long at the depots and teaching raw conscripts their trade. Everywhere he instilled a fighting spirit, making an army out of a mob, and thus he rapidly brought the defenses of Antwerp to a high order of readiness.<ref>Barton, Plunkett (1921). pp. 237\u201340</ref> With Antwerp bristling with cannon and numerous defenders, and with the Army of Antwerp whipped into fighting shape, the British, vexed by poor leadership and with half the army immobilized with fever thanks to the insalubrious islands upon which they were quartered, realized that it was no longer possible to close the [[Scheldt]], or take Antwerp, and withdrew their forces.<ref>Howard, Martin (2012). pp. 139\u201347.</ref> In a proclamation issued to his troops at Antwerp he made an implied charge against Napoleon of having neglected to prepare the proper means of defense for the Belgian coast.

He was 61 years old and in poor health. He was also childless; [[Hedvig Elisabeth Charlotte of Holstein-Gottorp|Queen Charlotte]] had given birth to two children who had died in infancy, and there was no prospect of her bearing another child.

However, Eug\u00e8ne, serving as viceroy in Italy, did not wish to convert to Lutheranism, a prerequisite for accepting the Swedish offer. Moreover, none of Napoleon's brothers was interested in going to Sweden and his nephews were too young, as the Swedes did not want the hazards of minority rule in the event King Charles died prematurely.<ref>Barton, D. Plunkett (1921). pp. 250\u201356, 268\u201372.</ref> The matter was decided by an obscure Swedish courtier, son of Baron Gustav M\u00f6rner, a commander of the Swedish force captured by Bernadotte at L\u00fcbeck, Baron [[Karl Otto M\u00f6rner]], who, entirely on his own initiative, offered the succession to the Swedish crown to Bernadotte.

The keynote of his whole policy was the acquisition of Norway as a compensation for the loss of Finland and Bernadotte proved anything but a puppet of France.{{sfn|Bain|1911|p=932}} Many Swedes expected him to reconquer Finland, which had been ceded to Russia; however, the Crown Prince was aware of its difficulty for reasons of the desperate situation of the state finance and the reluctance of the Finnish people to return to Sweden.<ref>Berdah, Jean-Francois (2009). p. 39</ref> Even if Finland was regained, he thought, it would put Sweden into a new cycle of conflicts with a powerful neighbor because there was no guarantee Russia would accept the loss as final.<ref>Palmer, Alan (1990). p. 181</ref> Therefore, he made up his mind to make a united [[Scandinavian Peninsula|Scandinavian peninsula]], which was easier to defend, by taking Norway (intentionally without the ancient and remote provinces of [[Greenland]], [[Iceland]] and the [[Faroe Islands]]) from Denmark and uniting her to Sweden. He tried to divert public opinion from Finland to Norway, by arguing that to create a compact peninsula, with sea for its natural boundary, was to inaugurate an era of peace, and that waging war with Russia would lead to ruinous consequences.<ref>Barton, Sir Dunbar Plunket (1930). pp. 257\u201358</ref>\n\nSoon after Charles John's arrival in Sweden, Napoleon compelled him to accede to the [[Continental System]] and declare war against Great Britain; otherwise, Sweden would have to face the determination of France, Denmark and Russia. This demand would mean a hard blow to the national economy and the Swedish population. Sweden reluctantly declared war against Great Britain but it was treated by both countries as being merely nominal, although Swedish imports of British goods decreased from \u00a34,871 million in 1810 to \u00a3523 million in the following year.<ref>Berdah, Jean-Francois (2009). pp. 40\u201341</ref><ref>Barton, Sir Dunbar Plunket (1930). p. 259</ref>\n\nIn January 1812, French troops suddenly invaded [[Swedish Pomerania]] and the [[island of R\u00fcgen]].<ref>Barton, Sir Dunbar Plunket (1930). p. 265</ref> The decisive reason was that Napoleon, before marching to Moscow, had to secure his rear and dared not trust a Swedish continental foothold behind him.<ref name=\"Scott, Franklin D.1988.

The construction began in 1825, but the [[Storting]] halted the funding after the costly foundation was laid and demanded that the appointed architect, [[Hans Linstow]], construct a simpler palace.

The palace itself was not completed until 1849, long after the death of Charles John, and was inaugurated by [[Oscar I of Sweden|Oscar I]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.kongehuset.no/artikkel.html?tid=33470&sek=33469|title=History of the Royal Palace|website=www.kongehuset.no|language=no|access-date=14 August 2018}}</ref> The main street in Oslo, ''Slottsgate''n, would later be named after Charles John as [[Karl Johans gate]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.kongehuset.no/artikkel.html?tid=28686|title=King Carl Johan (1763\u20131844)|website=www.kongehuset.no|language=no|access-date=14 August 2018}}</ref>\n\nHis popularity decreased for a time in the 1830s, culminating in the [[Rabulist riots]] after the [[L\u00e8se-majest\u00e9]] conviction of the journalist [[Magnus Jacob Crusenstolpe]], and some calls for his abdication.<ref name=Britannica/> Charles John survived the abdication controversy and he went on to have his [[silver jubilee]], which was celebrated with great enthusiasm on 18 February 1843.

The development of the Proto-Nilotes as a group may have been connected with their domestication of [[livestock]]. The Eastern Sudanic unity must have been considerably earlier still, perhaps around the 5th millennium BC (while the proposed [[Nilo-Saharan]] unity would date to the [[Upper Paleolithic]] about 15kya). The original locus of the early Nilotic speakers was presumably east of the Nile in what is now [[South Sudan]]. The Proto-Nilotes of the 3rd millennium BC were [[pastoralists]], while their neighbors, the Proto-[[Central Sudanic]] peoples, were mostly agriculturalists.<ref>John Desmond Clark, ''From Hunters to Farmers: The Causes and Consequences of Food Production in Africa'', University of California Press, 1984, p. 31</ref>\n\n===Early Expansion===\n{{see also|Elmenteitan}}\nLanguage evidence indicates an initial southward expansion out of the Nilotic nursery into far southern Sudan beginning in the second millennium B.C.,\nthe [[Southern Nilotic]] communities that participated in this expansion would eventually reach western Kenya between 1000 and 500 B.C.<ref>Ehret, Christopher.

These groups spread from the [[Sudd]] marshlands, where archaeological evidence shows that a culture based on [[transhumance|transhumant]] cattle raising had been present since 3000 BCE, and the Nilotic culture in that area may thus be continuous to that date.<ref name=\"Robertshaw1987\">{{cite journal|last1=Robertshaw|first1=Peter|title=Prehistory in the Upper Nile Basin|journal=Journal of African History|date=1987|volume=28|issue=2|pages=177\u2013189|url=http://docdro.id/1l6KU4f|accessdate=20 November 2017|doi=10.1017/S002185370002973X}}</ref>\n\nThe Nilotic expansion from the Sudd Marshes into the rest of South Sudan seems to have begun in the 14th century. This coincides with the collapse of the Christian Nubian kingdoms of [[Makuria]] and [[Alodia]] and the penetration of Arab traders into central Sudan. From the Arabs the South Sudanese may have obtained new breeds of hump-less cattle.<ref name=\"Robertshaw1987\"/> Archaeologist [[Roland Oliver]] notes that the period also shows an [[Iron Age]] beginning among the Nilotics.

The C\u00f8ll\u00f8 controlled the west bank of the White Nile, but the other side was controlled by the Funj Sultanate, and there were regular conflict between the two. The C\u00f8ll\u00f8 had the ability to quickly raid outside areas by [[war canoe]], and had control of the waters of the Nile. The Funj had a standing army of armoured cavalry, and this force allowed them to dominated the plains of the [[sahel]].\n\nC\u00f8ll\u00f8 traditions tell of R\u00e4dh [[Odak Ocollo]] who ruled c. 1630 and led them in a three decade war with Sennar over control of the White Nile trade routes. The C\u00f8ll\u00f8 allied with the [[Sultanate of Darfur]] and the Kingdom of [[Takali]] against the Funj, but the capitulation of Takali ended the war in the Funj's favour. In the later 17th century the C\u00f8ll\u00f8 and Funj allied against the [[Jieng]], a group of [[Dinka]] who rose to power in the border area between the Funj and C\u00f8ll\u00f8. The C\u00f8ll\u00f8 political structure gradually centralized under the a king or ''reth''. The most important is R\u00e4dh Tug\u00f8 (son of R\u00e4dh Dh\u00f8k\u00f6\u00f6dh\u00f8) who ruled c. 1690 to 1710 and established the C\u00f8ll\u00f8 capital of [[Fashoda]]. The same period saw the gradual collapse of the Funj sultanate, leaving the C\u00f8ll\u00f8 in complete control of the White Nile and its trade routes. The C\u00f8ll\u00f8 military power was based on control of the river.<ref>{{cite book\n|editor1-first=B.

The [[Dinka religion]] has a [[pantheon (religion)|pantheon]] of deities.

[[Dengdit]] or Deng, is the sky God of rain and fertility, empowered by Nhialic.<ref>Lienhardt, p 104</ref> Deng's mother is [[Abuk]], the patron Goddess of gardening and all women, represented by a snake.<ref>Lienhardt, p 90</ref> Garang, another deity, is believed or assumed by some Dinka to be a god suppressed by Deng; his spirits can cause most Dinka women, and some men, to scream. The term ''\"Jok\"'' refers to a group of ancestral spirits.\n\nIn the [[Lotuko mythology]], the chief God is called [[Ajok]]. He is generally seen as kind and benevolent, but can be angered. He once reportedly answered a woman's prayer for the resurrection of her son. Her husband, however, was angry and killed the child. According to the Lotuko religion, Ajok was annoyed by the man's actions and swore never to resurrect any Lotuko again.

They often possess exceptionally long limbs, particularly vis-a-vis the distal segments (forearms, calves). This characteristic is thought to be a climatic adaptation to allow their bodies to shed heat more efficiently.\n\nSudanese Nilotes are regarded as one of the tallest peoples in the world.

The development of the Proto-Nilotes as a group may have been connected with their domestication of [[livestock]]. The Eastern Sudanic unity must have been considerably earlier still, perhaps around the 5th millennium BC (while the proposed [[Nilo-Saharan]] unity would date to the [[Upper Paleolithic]] about 15kya). The original locus of the early Nilotic speakers was presumably east of the Nile in what is now [[South Sudan]]. The Proto-Nilotes of the 3rd millennium BC were [[pastoralists]], while their neighbors, the Proto-[[Central Sudanic]] peoples, were mostly agriculturalists.<ref>John Desmond Clark, ''From Hunters to Farmers: The Causes and Consequences of Food Production in Africa'', University of California Press, 1984, p. 31</ref>\n\n===Early Expansion===\n{{see also|Elmenteitan}}\nLanguage evidence indicates an initial southward expansion out of the Nilotic nursery into far southern Sudan beginning in the second millennium B.C.,\nthe [[Southern Nilotic]] communities that participated in this expansion would eventually reach western Kenya between 1000 and 500 B.C.<ref>Ehret, Christopher.

From the Arabs the South Sudanese may have obtained new breeds of hump-less cattle.<ref name=\"Robertshaw1987\"/> Archaeologist [[Roland Oliver]] notes that the period also shows an [[Iron Age]] beginning among the Nilotics.

The C\u00f8ll\u00f8 controlled the west bank of the White Nile, but the other side was controlled by the Funj Sultanate, and there were regular conflict between the two. The C\u00f8ll\u00f8 had the ability to quickly raid outside areas by [[war canoe]], and had control of the waters of the Nile. The Funj had a standing army of armoured cavalry, and this force allowed them to dominated the plains of the [[sahel]].\n\nC\u00f8ll\u00f8 traditions tell of R\u00e4dh [[Odak Ocollo]] who ruled c. 1630 and led them in a three decade war with Sennar over control of the White Nile trade routes. The C\u00f8ll\u00f8 allied with the [[Sultanate of Darfur]] and the Kingdom of [[Takali]] against the Funj, but the capitulation of Takali ended the war in the Funj's favour. In the later 17th century the C\u00f8ll\u00f8 and Funj allied against the [[Jieng]], a group of [[Dinka]] who rose to power in the border area between the Funj and C\u00f8ll\u00f8. The C\u00f8ll\u00f8 political structure gradually centralized under the a king or ''reth''. The most important is R\u00e4dh Tug\u00f8 (son of R\u00e4dh Dh\u00f8k\u00f6\u00f6dh\u00f8) who ruled c. 1690 to 1710 and established the C\u00f8ll\u00f8 capital of [[Fashoda]]. The same period saw the gradual collapse of the Funj sultanate, leaving the C\u00f8ll\u00f8 in complete control of the White Nile and its trade routes. The C\u00f8ll\u00f8 military power was based on control of the river.<ref>{{cite book\n|editor1-first=B.

The term ''\"Jok\"'' refers to a group of ancestral spirits.\n\nIn the [[Lotuko mythology]], the chief God is called [[Ajok]]. He is generally seen as kind and benevolent, but can be angered. He once reportedly answered a woman's prayer for the resurrection of her son. Her husband, however, was angry and killed the child. According to the Lotuko religion, Ajok was annoyed by the man's actions and swore never to resurrect any Lotuko again.

They often possess exceptionally long limbs, particularly vis-a-vis the distal segments (forearms, calves). This characteristic is thought to be a climatic adaptation to allow their bodies to shed heat more efficiently.\n\nSudanese Nilotes are regarded as one of the tallest peoples in the world.
