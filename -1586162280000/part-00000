An overarching theme in examples is that children acquire grammatical rules based on evidence that is consistent with multiple generalizations. And since children are not instructed in the grammar of their language, the gap must be filled in by properties of the learner.\n\n===Syntax===\n====Binding theory \u2013 Principle C====\n# While he was dancing, the Ninja Turtle ate pizza.\n# He ate pizza while the Ninja Turtle was dancing.\nIn general, pronouns can refer to any prominent individual in the discourse context. However, a pronoun cannot find its antecedent in certain structural positions, as defined by the [[Binding (linguistics)|Binding Theory]]. For example, the pronoun \"he\" can refer to the Ninja Turtle in (1) but not (2), above. Given that speech to children does not indicate what interpretations are impossible, the input is equally consistent with a grammar that allows coreference between \"he\" and \"the Ninja Turtle\" in (2) and one that does not. But, since all speakers of English recognize that (2) does not allow this coreference, this aspect of the grammar must come from some property internal to the learner.<ref name=\"Oh Jeffrey Boy\" />\n\n====Passives====\n# I believe the dog to be hungry\n# The dog is believed to be hungry\n# I believe the dog's owner to be hungry.\n# The dog's owner is believed to be hungry.\n# * The dog is believed's owner to be hungry.\nThe sentences in (1) and (2) illustrate the [[English passive voice|active-passive alternation in English]]. The Noun Phrase after the verb in the active (1) is the subject in the passive (2). Data like (2) would be compatible with a passive rule stated in terms of linear order (move the 1st NP after the verb) or syntactic structure (move the highest NP after the verb). The data in (3-5) illustrate that the actual rule is formulated in terms of structure. If it were stated in terms of linear order, then (4) would be ungrammatical and (5) would be grammatical. But the opposite is true. However, children may not be exposed to sentences like (3-5) as evidence in favor of the correct grammar. Thus, the fact that all adult speakers agree that (4) is grammatical and (5) is not suggests that the linear rule was never even considered and that children are predisposed to a structure based grammatical system.<ref name=\"Oh Jeffrey Boy\" />\n\n====Anaphoric \"one\"====\nThe English word \"one\" can refer back to a previously mentioned property in the discourse. For example in (1), \"one\" can mean \"ball\". \n# I like this ball and you like that one. \n# I like this red ball and you like that one. \nIn (2), one is interpreted as \"red ball.\" However, even if a speaker intends (2) in this way, it would be difficult to distinguish that interpretation from one in which \"one\" simply meant \"ball\". This is because when a speaker refers to a red ball, they are also referring to a ball since the set of red balls is a subset of balls in general. 18-month-olds, like adults, show that they believe 'one' refers to 'red ball' and not 'ball'.<ref name=\"Infants\">{{cite journal|last1=Lidz|first1=J.|last2=Freedman|first2=J.|last3=Waxman|first3=S.|date=October 2003|title=What infants know about syntax but couldn't have learned: experimental evidence for syntactic structure at 18 months|journal=Cognition|volume=89|pages=295\u2013303|number=3|doi=10.1016/s0010-0277(03)00116-1}}</ref> The evidence available to children is systematically ambiguous between a grammar in which \"one\" refers back to Nouns and one in which \"one\" refers back to noun phrases. Despite this ambiguity, children learn the more narrow interpretation, suggesting that some property other than the input is responsible for their interpretations.\n\n====Island effects====\nIn Wh-questions, the Wh-word at the beginning of the sentence (the filler) is related to a position later in the sentence (the gap). This relation can hold over an unbounded distance, as in (1). However, there are restrictions on the gap positions that a filler can be related to. These restrictions are called [[Wh-movement#Extraction islands|syntactic islands]] (2). Because questions with islands are ungrammatical, they are not included in the speech that children hear\u2014but neither are grammatical Wh-questions that span multiple clauses. Because the speech children are exposed to is consistent with grammars which have island constraints and grammars which don't, something internal to the child must contribute this knowledge.\n#What did you claim that Jack bought _ ?\n#<nowiki>*What did you make the claim that Jack bought _ ?

If the last vowel was long, then it bore [[stress (linguistics)|stress]]. Otherwise, stress fell on the first syllable. This pattern is consistent with two grammars. In one grammar, a long vowel bears stress if it is the last segment in the word. This is a rule based on absolute finality. In the other grammar, a long vowel bears stress only if it is the last vowel in the word (i.e., even if it is not the last segment of the word). This is a rule based on relative finality. In natural languages stress rules make reference to relative finality but not to absolute finality. After being exposed to these words, participants were then tested to see whether they thought that a word with a long vowel in a closed syllable (CVVC) would bear stress. If it did, then that would be consistent with the relative-final grammar, but not with the absolute-final grammar. English-speaking adults (tested through computer software) were more likely to accept the words from the relative-final grammar than from the absolute-final grammar. Since the data they were exposed to was equally consistent with both grammars, and since neither rule is a rule of English, the source of this decision must have come from the participants, not from any aspect of their experience. In addition, eighth-month-old children (tested via the [[Statistical language acquisition#Headturn Preference Procedure (HPP)|Headturn Preference Procedure]]) were found to have the same preference as adults. Given that this preference could not have come from their exposure to either the artificial language or to their native language, the researchers concluded that human language acquisition mechanisms are \"hardwired\" to lead infants towards certain generalizations, consistent with the argument for the poverty of the stimulus.\n\n==== English plural marker ====\n\nHalle (1978)<ref name=\"Halle\" /> argues that the morphophonological rule governing the [[English plurals|English plural]] produces forms that are consistent with two grammars. In one grammar, the plural is pronounced as [s] if it follows one of the sounds [p, t, k, f, \u03b8]; otherwise it is pronounced as [z]. In the other grammar, the plural is pronounced as [s] if it follows a voiceless consonant. These rules are exactly equal in their coverage of English since the set of consonants that triggers the [s] pronunciation is identical in the two cases. However, Halle also observes that English speakers consistently pluralize the German name ''Bach'' (pronounced ''/bax/'') as ''/baxs/'', despite not having any experience with the ''/x/'' sound, which is nonexistent in English. Since there is \"no indication\" that speakers could have acquired this knowledge, Halle argues that the tendency to build rules in terms of natural classes comes from a factor internal to the child and not from their experience.<ref name=\"Halle\">{{Cite book|url=https://mitpress.mit.edu/sites/default/files/titles/content/9780262580434_sch_0009.pdf|title=From Memory to Speech and Back: Papers on Phonetics and Phonology|last=Halle|first=Morris|publisher=Walter de Gruyter|year=2003|isbn=|location=|pages=294\u2013303}}</ref>\n\n=== Semantics ===\n\n==== Word learning ====\n\nThe poverty of the stimulus also applies in the domain of word learning. When learning a new word, children are exposed to examples of the word's referent, but not to the full extent of the category. For example, in learning the word \"dog\", a child might see a German Shepherd, a Great Dane and a Poodle. How do they know to extend this category to include Dachshunds and Bulldogs? The situations in which the word is used cannot provide the relevant information. Thus, something internal to learners must shape the way that they generalize. This problem is closely related to [[Willard Van Orman Quine|Quine]]'s [[Indeterminacy of translation|gavagai]] problem.\n\n==== Attitude verbs ====\nIn other cases, words refer to aspects of the world that cannot be observed directly. For example [[Lila R. Gleitman|Lila Gleitman]] poses a POS argument with respect to verbs that label mental states. She observes that a learner cannot see inside another person's mind, and so an utterance of \"Kim thinks that it is raining\" is likely to occur in the same kinds of [[context (language use)|context]]s as \"Kim wonders if it is raining\" or even \"Kim wants it to rain\". If no aspect of the context can determine whether a mental state verb refers to thinkings, wanting or wonderings, then some aspect of children's minds must direct their attention to other cues. Thus, our ability to learn these word meanings must be shaped by factors internal to the child and not simply from the conditions of their use.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Gleitman|first=Lila R.|last2=Cassidy|first2=Kimberly|last3=Nappa|first3=Rebecca|last4=Papafragou|first4=Anna|last5=Trueswell|first5=John C.|date=2005-01-01|title=Hard Words|journal=Language Learning and Development|volume=1|issue=1|pages=23\u201364|doi=10.1207/s15473341lld0101_4|issn=1547-5441}}</ref>\n\n==Rejection by the scientific community==\nCritics demonstrated in the 1980s and 1990s that Chomsky's purported linguistic evidence for Poverty of the Stimulus had been false.<ref>{{cite journal |last1= Pullum|first1=GK|last2=Scholz |first2=BC |date=2002|title=Empirical assessment of stimulus poverty arguments |url= http://www.ucd.ie/artspgs/research/pullum.pdf|journal=The Linguistic Review |volume=18|issue=1\u20142|pages= 9\u201450 |doi=10.1515/tlir.19.1-2.9|access-date=2020-02-28 }}</ref> Around the same time there was research in [[applied linguistics]] and [[neuroscience]] that rejected the idea of languages being innate and not learned.<ref name=Fernald&Marchman_2006 /> This led to the rejection of innatism by the mainstream child [[language acquisition]] community, with [[generative grammar]] being pushed into the margins.<ref name=DeBot_2015>{{cite book |last=de Bot |first=Kees |year=2015| title=A History of Applied Linguistics: From 1980 to the Present |publisher=Routledge |url= |pages= |isbn= 9781138820654 |access-date=}}</ref> According to some professionals, decades of research were wasted between 1964 and 2014 due to Chomsky's influence;

An overarching theme in examples is that children acquire grammatical rules based on evidence that is consistent with multiple generalizations. And since children are not instructed in the grammar of their language, the gap must be filled in by properties of the learner.\n\n===Syntax===\n====Binding theory \u2013 Principle C====\n# While he was dancing, the Ninja Turtle ate pizza.\n# He ate pizza while the Ninja Turtle was dancing.\nIn general, pronouns can refer to any prominent individual in the discourse context. However, a pronoun cannot find its antecedent in certain structural positions, as defined by the [[Binding (linguistics)|Binding Theory]]. For example, the pronoun \"he\" can refer to the Ninja Turtle in (1) but not (2), above. Given that speech to children does not indicate what interpretations are impossible, the input is equally consistent with a grammar that allows coreference between \"he\" and \"the Ninja Turtle\" in (2) and one that does not. But, since all speakers of English recognize that (2) does not allow this coreference, this aspect of the grammar must come from some property internal to the learner.<ref name=\"Oh Jeffrey Boy\" />\n\n====Passives====\n# I believe the dog to be hungry\n# The dog is believed to be hungry\n# I believe the dog's owner to be hungry.\n# The dog's owner is believed to be hungry.\n# * The dog is believed's owner to be hungry.\nThe sentences in (1) and (2) illustrate the [[English passive voice|active-passive alternation in English]]. The Noun Phrase after the verb in the active (1) is the subject in the passive (2). Data like (2) would be compatible with a passive rule stated in terms of linear order (move the 1st NP after the verb) or syntactic structure (move the highest NP after the verb). The data in (3-5) illustrate that the actual rule is formulated in terms of structure. If it were stated in terms of linear order, then (4) would be ungrammatical and (5) would be grammatical. But the opposite is true. However, children may not be exposed to sentences like (3-5) as evidence in favor of the correct grammar. Thus, the fact that all adult speakers agree that (4) is grammatical and (5) is not suggests that the linear rule was never even considered and that children are predisposed to a structure based grammatical system.<ref name=\"Oh Jeffrey Boy\" />\n\n====Anaphoric \"one\"====\nThe English word \"one\" can refer back to a previously mentioned property in the discourse. For example in (1), \"one\" can mean \"ball\". \n# I like this ball and you like that one. \n# I like this red ball and you like that one. \nIn (2), one is interpreted as \"red ball.\" However, even if a speaker intends (2) in this way, it would be difficult to distinguish that interpretation from one in which \"one\" simply meant \"ball\". This is because when a speaker refers to a red ball, they are also referring to a ball since the set of red balls is a subset of balls in general. 18-month-olds, like adults, show that they believe 'one' refers to 'red ball' and not 'ball'.<ref name=\"Infants\">{{cite journal|last1=Lidz|first1=J.|last2=Freedman|first2=J.|last3=Waxman|first3=S.|date=October 2003|title=What infants know about syntax but couldn't have learned: experimental evidence for syntactic structure at 18 months|journal=Cognition|volume=89|pages=295\u2013303|number=3|doi=10.1016/s0010-0277(03)00116-1}}</ref> The evidence available to children is systematically ambiguous between a grammar in which \"one\" refers back to Nouns and one in which \"one\" refers back to noun phrases. Despite this ambiguity, children learn the more narrow interpretation, suggesting that some property other than the input is responsible for their interpretations.\n\n====Island effects====\nIn Wh-questions, the Wh-word at the beginning of the sentence (the filler) is related to a position later in the sentence (the gap). This relation can hold over an unbounded distance, as in (1). However, there are restrictions on the gap positions that a filler can be related to. These restrictions are called [[Wh-movement#Extraction islands|syntactic islands]] (2). Because questions with islands are ungrammatical, they are not included in the speech that children hear\u2014but neither are grammatical Wh-questions that span multiple clauses. Because the speech children are exposed to is consistent with grammars which have island constraints and grammars which don't, something internal to the child must contribute this knowledge.\n#What did you claim that Jack bought _ ?\n#<nowiki>*What did you make the claim that Jack bought _ ?

If the last vowel was long, then it bore [[stress (linguistics)|stress]]. Otherwise, stress fell on the first syllable. This pattern is consistent with two grammars. In one grammar, a long vowel bears stress if it is the last segment in the word. This is a rule based on absolute finality. In the other grammar, a long vowel bears stress only if it is the last vowel in the word (i.e., even if it is not the last segment of the word). This is a rule based on relative finality. In natural languages stress rules make reference to relative finality but not to absolute finality. After being exposed to these words, participants were then tested to see whether they thought that a word with a long vowel in a closed syllable (CVVC) would bear stress. If it did, then that would be consistent with the relative-final grammar, but not with the absolute-final grammar. English-speaking adults (tested through computer software) were more likely to accept the words from the relative-final grammar than from the absolute-final grammar. Since the data they were exposed to was equally consistent with both grammars, and since neither rule is a rule of English, the source of this decision must have come from the participants, not from any aspect of their experience. In addition, eighth-month-old children (tested via the [[Statistical language acquisition#Headturn Preference Procedure (HPP)|Headturn Preference Procedure]]) were found to have the same preference as adults. Given that this preference could not have come from their exposure to either the artificial language or to their native language, the researchers concluded that human language acquisition mechanisms are \"hardwired\" to lead infants towards certain generalizations, consistent with the argument for the poverty of the stimulus.\n\n==== English plural marker ====\n\nHalle (1978)<ref name=\"Halle\" /> argues that the morphophonological rule governing the [[English plurals|English plural]] produces forms that are consistent with two grammars. In one grammar, the plural is pronounced as [s] if it follows one of the sounds [p, t, k, f, \u03b8]; otherwise it is pronounced as [z]. In the other grammar, the plural is pronounced as [s] if it follows a voiceless consonant. These rules are exactly equal in their coverage of English since the set of consonants that triggers the [s] pronunciation is identical in the two cases. However, Halle also observes that English speakers consistently pluralize the German name ''Bach'' (pronounced ''/bax/'') as ''/baxs/'', despite not having any experience with the ''/x/'' sound, which is nonexistent in English. Since there is \"no indication\" that speakers could have acquired this knowledge, Halle argues that the tendency to build rules in terms of natural classes comes from a factor internal to the child and not from their experience.<ref name=\"Halle\">{{Cite book|url=https://mitpress.mit.edu/sites/default/files/titles/content/9780262580434_sch_0009.pdf|title=From Memory to Speech and Back: Papers on Phonetics and Phonology|last=Halle|first=Morris|publisher=Walter de Gruyter|year=2003|isbn=|location=|pages=294\u2013303}}</ref>\n\n=== Semantics ===\n\n==== Word learning ====\n\nThe poverty of the stimulus also applies in the domain of word learning. When learning a new word, children are exposed to examples of the word's referent, but not to the full extent of the category. For example, in learning the word \"dog\", a child might see a German Shepherd, a Great Dane and a Poodle. How do they know to extend this category to include Dachshunds and Bulldogs? The situations in which the word is used cannot provide the relevant information. Thus, something internal to learners must shape the way that they generalize. This problem is closely related to [[Willard Van Orman Quine|Quine]]'s [[Indeterminacy of translation|gavagai]] problem.\n\n==== Attitude verbs ====\nIn other cases, words refer to aspects of the world that cannot be observed directly. For example [[Lila R. Gleitman|Lila Gleitman]] poses a POS argument with respect to verbs that label mental states. She observes that a learner cannot see inside another person's mind, and so an utterance of \"Kim thinks that it is raining\" is likely to occur in the same kinds of [[context (language use)|context]]s as \"Kim wonders if it is raining\" or even \"Kim wants it to rain\". If no aspect of the context can determine whether a mental state verb refers to thinkings, wanting or wonderings, then some aspect of children's minds must direct their attention to other cues. Thus, our ability to learn these word meanings must be shaped by factors internal to the child and not simply from the conditions of their use.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Gleitman|first=Lila R.|last2=Cassidy|first2=Kimberly|last3=Nappa|first3=Rebecca|last4=Papafragou|first4=Anna|last5=Trueswell|first5=John C.|date=2005-01-01|title=Hard Words|journal=Language Learning and Development|volume=1|issue=1|pages=23\u201364|doi=10.1207/s15473341lld0101_4|issn=1547-5441}}</ref>\n\n==Rejection by the scientific community==\nCritics demonstrated in the 1980s and 1990s that Chomsky's purported linguistic evidence for Poverty of the Stimulus had been false.<ref>{{cite journal |last1= Pullum|first1=GK|last2=Scholz |first2=BC |date=2002|title=Empirical assessment of stimulus poverty arguments |url= http://www.ucd.ie/artspgs/research/pullum.pdf|journal=The Linguistic Review |volume=18|issue=1\u20142|pages= 9\u201450 |doi=10.1515/tlir.19.1-2.9|access-date=2020-02-28 }}</ref> Around the same time there was research in [[applied linguistics]] and [[neuroscience]] that rejected the idea of languages being innate and not learned.<ref name=Fernald_Marchman_2006>{{cite book |last1=Fernald |first1=Anne| last2=Marchman |first2=Virginia A. |editor-last= Traxler and Gernsbacher |title=Handbook of Psycholinguistics |publisher=Academic Press |date=2006 |pages=1027\u20141071 |chapter= 27: Language learning in infancy |isbn= 9780080466415 |url=https://dinus.ac.id/repository/docs/ajar/Handbook-of-Psycho-Linguistics.pdf | access-date=2020-04-05}}</ref> This led to the rejection of innatism by the mainstream child [[language acquisition]] community, with [[generative grammar]] being pushed into the margins.<ref name=DeBot_2015>{{cite book |last=de Bot |first=Kees |year=2015| title=A History of Applied Linguistics: From 1980 to the Present |publisher=Routledge |url= |pages= |isbn= 9781138820654 |access-date=}}</ref> According to some professionals, decades of research were wasted between 1964 and 2014 due to Chomsky's influence;

She was the orphaned daughter of Mordecai's uncle, another Benjamite named Abihail. Upon the king's orders Esther was taken to palace where Hegai prepared her for meeting the king. Even as she advanced to the highest position of the harem, perfumed with [[myrrh]] and allocated certain foods and servants, she was under strict instructions from Mordecai, who met with her each day, to conceal her Jewish origins. The king falls in love with her and makes her Queen.<ref name=art01 />\n\nLater, Mordecai refuses to bow to [[Haman (Bible)|Haman]] the [[Agagite]], who was recently made Ahasuerus' highest advisor, and Haman requests and is given permission to order all the Jews in Persia to be killed. When Esther learns of this, Mordecai tells her to reveal to the king that she is Jewish and to ask him to repeal the order. Esther hesitates, saying that she could be put to death if she goes to the king without being summoned and the king does not want to see her; Mordecai urges her to try. She goes to the king, and the king welcomes her, and says he will give her anything she wants.  Instead of asking directly about the order, she invites the king and Haman to a banquet the next day. During the banquet, the king again asked Esther if there is anything she wants, and this time she asks the king to spare her life and that of all of the Jews. The king asks who was threatening them, and she names Haman. Haman throws himself at her feet; the king thinks that Haman is attacking her and orders him to be put to death, and gives all Haman's possessions to Esther. Esther tells the king about Mordecai's role in her life, and the king makes Mordecai his highest advisor. Esther then asks the king to revoke the order, and king allows Esther and Mordecai to do so, however they wish. They send out an order in the king's name that Jews can assemble and defend themselves, and can kill anyone who threatens them, and their families, and take their goods. On the thirteenth day of Adar, the same day that Haman had set for them to be killed, the Jews do so in one city, killing 500 people but not taking plunder, and they kill around 75,000 the next day again not taking plunder, and then they feast.<ref name=je>{{cite book |last1=Hirsch |first1=Emil G. |last2=Prince |first2=John Dyneley |last3=Schechter |first3=Solomon |title=Jewish Encyclopedia |date=1936 |publisher=Funk & Wagnalls Co. |location=New York |chapter-url=http://www.jewishencyclopedia.com/articles/5872-esther |chapter=Esther}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Ester y Mardoqueo escribiendo la primera carta del Purim (Ester, 9-20-21) - Aert de GELDER - Google Cultural Institute.jpg|thumbnail|File:Ester y Mardoqueo escribiendo la primera carta del Purim (Ester, 9-20-21) - Aert de GELDER - Google Cultural Institute.jpg|260px|Esther talking to Mordecai]]\n\n==Purim==\n{{Main article|Purim}}\nThe Jews established an annual feast, the feast of [[Purim]], in memory of their deliverance.

She was the orphaned daughter of Mordecai's uncle, another Benjamite named Abihail. Upon the king's orders Esther was taken to palace where Hegai prepared her for meeting the king.

When Esther learns of this, Mordecai tells her to reveal to the king that she is Jewish and to ask him to repeal the order. Esther hesitates, saying that she could be put to death if she goes to the king without being summoned and the king does not want to see her; Mordecai urges her to try. She goes to the king, and the king welcomes her, and says he will give her anything she wants.  Instead of asking directly about the order, she invites the king and Haman to a banquet the next day. During the banquet, the king again asked Esther if there is anything she wants, and this time she asks the king to spare her life and that of all of the Jews. The king asks who was threatening them, and she names Haman. Haman throws himself at her feet; the king thinks that Haman is attacking her and orders him to be put to death, and gives all Haman's possessions to Esther. Esther tells the king about Mordecai's role in her life, and the king makes Mordecai his highest advisor. Esther then asks the king to revoke the order, and king allows Esther and Mordecai to do so, however they wish. They send out an order in the king's name that Jews can assemble and defend themselves, and can kill anyone who threatens them, and their families, and take their goods.

\u00dcr\u00fcmqi has seen significant economical development since the 1990s and currently serves as a [[List of transport topics#Nodes|regional transport node]] and a cultural, political and commercial center.\n\n== History ==\n\nAlthough \u00dcr\u00fcmqi is situated near the northern route of the [[Silk Road]], the present city is a relatively young city. The earliest known settlement in the area can be dated to the 7th century CE, but there was no permanent settlement for a long period and it was not known as \u00dcr\u00fcmqi until the [[Dzungar Khanate]] in the 17th century. The current city dates from the rebuilding started in the 18th century.\n\n=== Early period ===\nDuring prehistory, the [[Gushi culture|Jushi]] or Gushi, a nomadic people who lived on the northern slopes of the Tianshan Mountains, inhabited the area.\n\nThe oldest known settlement in the area, a village called '''Urabo''' (or Wulabo), was located about {{convert|10|km|0|abbr=off}} from the southern suburbs of present-day \u00dcr\u00fcmqi.  Under the name '''Luntai''', the  city was established near Urabo by the [[Tang dynasty|Tang]] government during the 22nd year of [[Emperor Taizong of Tang|Emperor Taizong]]'s reign (648 AD), as part of the [[Protectorate General to Pacify the West]] that controlled Xinjiang.<ref name=chinatoday>{{cite web|url=http://www.chinatoday.com.cn/English/chinatours/urumqi.htm |title=Urumqi |publisher=Chinatoday.com.cn |date=1 February 1954 |access-date=19 February 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20021021001913/http://www.chinatoday.com.cn/English/chinatours/urumqi.htm |archive-date=21 October 2002 |url-status=dead }}</ref> It was a seat of local government, and collected taxes from the [[caravan (travellers)|caravans]] along the northern route of the Silk Road.<ref name=chinatoday />\n\nAfter the Tang retreated from the [[Western Regions]], the region came under the control of the [[Uyghurs]] of the [[Uyghur Khaganate|Khaganate]] and [[Gaochang]]/[[Qocho]]. After the Tang until the Qing Dynasty, there was little information about the \u00dcr\u00fcmqi area, and there appeared to be no permanent settlement here for most of this period.

The earliest known settlement in the area can be dated to the 7th century CE, but there was no permanent settlement for a long period and it was not known as \u00dcr\u00fcmqi until the [[Dzungar Khanate]] in the 17th century. The current city dates from the rebuilding started in the 18th century.\n\n=== Early period ===\nDuring prehistory, the [[Gushi culture|Jushi]] or Gushi, a nomadic people who lived on the northern slopes of the Tianshan Mountains, inhabited the area.\n\nThe oldest known settlement in the area, a village called '''Urabo''' (or Wulabo), was located about {{convert|10|km|0|abbr=off}} from the southern suburbs of present-day \u00dcr\u00fcmqi.  Under the name '''Luntai''', the  city was established near Urabo by the [[Tang dynasty|Tang]] government during the 22nd year of [[Emperor Taizong of Tang|Emperor Taizong]]'s reign (648 AD), as part of the [[Protectorate General to Pacify the West]] that controlled Xinjiang.<ref name=chinatoday>{{cite web|url=http://www.chinatoday.com.cn/English/chinatours/urumqi.htm |title=Urumqi |publisher=Chinatoday.com.cn |date=1 February 1954 |access-date=19 February 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20021021001913/http://www.chinatoday.com.cn/English/chinatours/urumqi.htm |archive-date=21 October 2002 |url-status=dead }}</ref> It was a seat of local government, and collected taxes from the [[caravan (travellers)|caravans]] along the northern route of the Silk Road.<ref name=chinatoday />\n\nAfter the Tang retreated from the [[Western Regions]], the region came under the control of the [[Uyghurs]] of the [[Uyghur Khaganate|Khaganate]] and [[Gaochang]]/[[Qocho]]. After the Tang until the Qing Dynasty, there was little information about the \u00dcr\u00fcmqi area, and there appeared to be no permanent settlement here for most of this period. The Mongols referred to the wider area as [[Beshbalik|Bishbalik]] meaning five cities, referring to the five towns that surrounded the present-day \u00dcr\u00fcmqi area.<ref name=\"piper\"/>\n\n===Dzungar period===\nThe [[Oirats]] [[Dzungar people|Dzungar]] tribes that formed the [[Dzungar Khanate]] were the last major power to control \u00dcr\u00fcmqi before the Manchus gained control of Xinjiang, and their language gave \u00dcr\u00fcmqi its modern-day name.

Because of the mountainous terrain, the existing network consisted of {{RailGauge|1067mm|lk=on}} narrow-gauge lines, which generally took indirect routes and could not be adapted to higher speeds. Consequently, Japan had a greater need for new high-speed lines than countries where the existing [[standard gauge]] or [[broad gauge]] rail system had more upgrade potential.\n\nAmong the key people credited with the construction of the first Shinkansen are [[Hideo Shima]], the Chief Engineer, and [[Shinji Sog\u014d]], the first President of [[Japanese National Railways]] (JNR) who managed to persuade politicians to back the plan. Other significant people responsible for its technical development were Tadanao Miki, Tadashi Matsudaira, and Hajime Kawanabe based at the [[Railway Technical Research Institute]] (RTRI), part of JNR. They were responsible for much of the technical development of the first line, the [[T\u014dkaid\u014d Shinkansen]]. All three had worked on aircraft design during [[World War II]].<ref name=\"Hood\">{{Cite book | last = Hood | first = Christopher P. | title = Shinkansen \u2013 From Bullet Train to Symbol of Modern Japan | series = Routledge Contemporary Japan Series | publisher = Routledge | location=London | url =https://books.google.com/books?id=cwbklrvmS-oC | year = 2007 | isbn = 978-0-415-32052-8 | pages = 18\u201343}}</ref>\n\n=== Early proposals ===\nThe popular English name ''bullet train'' is a literal translation of the Japanese term {{Nihongo|''dangan ressha''|\u5f3e\u4e38\u5217\u8eca}}, a nickname given to the project while it was initially being discussed in the 1930s. The name stuck because of the original [[0 Series Shinkansen]]'s resemblance to a bullet and its high speed.\n\nThe ''Shinkansen'' name was first formally used in 1940 for a proposed standard gauge passenger and freight line between Tokyo and [[Shimonoseki]] that would have used steam and electric locomotives with a top speed of {{convert|200|km/h|mph|abbr=on}}. Over the next three years, the Ministry of Railways drew up more ambitious plans to extend the line to Beijing (through a [[Japan\u2013Korea Undersea Tunnel|tunnel to Korea]]) and even [[Singapore]], and build connections to the [[Trans-Siberian Railway]] and other trunk lines in Asia. These plans were abandoned in 1943 as Japan's position in World War II worsened. However, some construction did commence on the line; several tunnels on the present-day Shinkansen date to the war-era project.\n\n=== Construction ===\nFollowing the end of World War II, high-speed rail was forgotten for several years while traffic of passengers and freight steadily increased on the conventional [[T\u014dkaid\u014d Main Line]] along with the reconstruction of Japanese industry and economy. By the mid-1950s the T\u014dkaid\u014d Line was operating at full capacity, and the Ministry of Railways decided to revisit the Shinkansen project. In 1957, [[Odakyu Electric Railway]] introduced its [[Odakyu 3000 series SE|3000 series SE]] [[Romancecar]] train, setting a world speed record of {{convert|145|km/h|mph|0|abbr=on}} for a narrow gauge train. This train gave designers the confidence that they could safely build an even faster standard gauge train. Thus the first Shinkansen, the 0 series, was built on the success of the Romancecar.\n\nIn the 1950s, the Japanese national attitude was that railways would soon be outdated and replaced by air travel and highways as in America and many countries in Europe. However, [[Shinji Sog\u014d]], President of [[Japanese National Railways]], insisted strongly on the possibility of [[high-speed rail]], and the Shinkansen project was implemented.\n\nGovernment approval came in December 1958, and construction of the first segment of the [[T\u014dkaid\u014d Shinkansen]] between Tokyo and [[Osaka]] started in April 1959. The cost of constructing the Shinkansen was at first estimated at nearly 200 billion yen, which was raised in the form of a government loan, railway bonds and a low-interest loan of US$80 million from the [[World Bank]]. Initial cost estimates, however, had been deliberately understated and the actual figures were nearly double at about 400 billion yen.

Prime Minister [[Kakuei Tanaka]] was an ardent supporter of the Shinkansen, and his government proposed an extensive network paralleling most existing trunk lines. Two new lines, the [[T\u014dhoku Shinkansen]] and [[J\u014detsu Shinkansen]], were built following this plan. Many other planned lines were delayed or scrapped entirely as [[Japanese National Railways|JNR]] slid into debt throughout the late 1970s, largely because of the high cost of building the Shinkansen network. By the early 1980s, the company was practically insolvent, leading to its privatization in 1987.\n\nDevelopment of the Shinkansen by the privatised regional JR companies has continued, with new train models developed, each generally with its own distinctive appearance (such as the [[500 Series Shinkansen|500 series]] introduced by [[JR West]]). Since 2014, Shinkansen trains run regularly at speeds up to {{convert|320|km/h|mph|round=5|abbr=on}} on the [[T\u014dhoku Shinkansen]], only the [[Shanghai maglev train]] and [[China Railway High-speed]] networks have commercial services that operate faster.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.cntraveler.com/stories/2016-05-18/the-10-fastest-trains-in-the-world |title=The 10 fastest trains in the world |publisher=cntraveler.com |date= |accessdate=8 December 2019}}</ref> \n\nSince 1970, development has also been underway for the [[Ch\u016b\u014d Shinkansen]], a planned [[maglev]] line from Tokyo to Osaka. On 21 April 2015, a seven-car [[L0 series]] maglev trainset set a [[Land speed record for railed vehicles|world speed record]] of {{convert|603|km/h|mph|0|abbr=on}}.<ref name=\"guardian20150421\"/>\n\n== Technology ==\nTo enable high-speed operation Shinkansen uses a range of advanced technology compared with conventional rail, achieving not only high speed but also a high standard of safety and comfort. Its success has influenced other railways in the world and the importance and advantage of [[high-speed rail]] has consequently been reevaluated.\n\n=== Routing ===\nShinkansen routes are completely separate from conventional rail lines (except [[Mini-shinkansen]] which goes through to conventional lines). Consequently, the shinkansen is not affected by slower local or freight trains (except for [[Hokkaido Shinkansen]] while traveling through the [[Seikan Tunnel]]), and has the capacity to operate many high-speed trains punctually. The lines have been built without [[level crossing|road crossings at grade]]. Tracks are strictly off-limits with penalties against trespassing strictly regulated by law. It uses tunnels and [[viaduct]]s to go through and over obstacles rather than around them, with a minimum curve radius of 4,000&nbsp;meters (2,500&nbsp;meters on the oldest T\u014dkaid\u014d Shinkansen).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.jrtr.net/jrtr11/history.html|title=Railway Modernization and Shinkansen|publisher=Japan Railway & Transport Review|date=30 April 2011|accessdate=30 April 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110613154641/http://www.jrtr.net/jrtr11/history.html|archive-date=13 June 2011|url-status=dead|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\n=== Track ===\n[[File:Toyohashi Station 001.JPG|thumb|Shinkansen [[standard gauge]] track, with welded rails to reduce vibration]]\nThe Shinkansen uses {{RailGauge|1435mm}} [[standard gauge]] in contrast to the {{RailGauge|1067mm}} narrow gauge of older lines. [[Continuous welded rail]] and [[swingnose crossing]] points are employed, eliminating gaps at turnouts and crossings. Long rails are used, joined by expansion joints to minimize gauge fluctuation due to thermal elongation and shrinkage.\n\nA combination of [[track ballast|ballasted]] and [[slab track]] is used, with slab track exclusively employed on concrete bed sections such as viaducts and tunnels. Slab track is significantly more cost-effective in tunnel sections, since the lower track height reduces the cross-sectional area of the tunnel, thereby reducing construction costs by up to 30%.<ref>Miura, S., Takai, H., Uchida, M., and Fukada, Y. The Mechanism of Railway Tracks. Japan Railway & Transport Review, 15, 38\u201345, 1998</ref>\nHowever, the smaller diameter of Shinkansen tunnels compared to some other high-speed lines has resulted in the issue of [[Piston effect|tunnel boom]] becoming a concern for residents living close to tunnel portals.\n\nThe slab track consists of rails, fasteners and track slabs with a cement asphalt mortar. On the roadbed and in tunnels, circular upstands (measuring 400\u2013520&nbsp;mm in diameter and 200&nbsp;mm high) are located at 5 metre intervals. The \nprefabricated upstands are made of either [[reinforced concrete]] or pre-stressed reinforced concrete; they prevent the track slab from moving along either the latitudinal or the longitudinal directions. One track slab weighs approximately 5 tons, measuring 2220\u20132340&nbsp;mm wide, 4900\u20134950&nbsp;mm long and 160\u2013200&nbsp;mm thick.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Ando |first1=Katsutoshi |display-authors=etal |date=2001 |title=Development of Slab Tracks for Hokuriku Shinkansen Line |journal=Quarterly Report of RTRI |volume=42 |issue=1 |pages=35\u201341 |doi=10.2219/rtriqr.42.35 }}</ref>\n\n=== Signal system ===\n[[File:ATC TEC.png|thumb|Braking curve for the original ATC-1 used on the [[Tokaido Shinkansen]] (vertical axis represents the speed of the train whereas the horizontal axis represents the distance)]]\n[[File:\u65b0\u5e79\u7dda\u7dcf\u5408\u6307\u4ee4\u6240(\u4eac\u90fd\u9244\u9053\u535a\u7269\u9928).jpg|thumb|Replica of the Shinkansen CTC as seen at the [[Kyoto Railway Museum]]]]\nThe Shinkansen employs an [[Automatic Train Control|ATC]] (Automatic Train Control) system, eliminating the need for trackside signals. It uses a comprehensive system of [[Automatic Train Protection]].<ref name=\"Smith\" /> [[Centralized traffic control]] manages all train operations, and all tasks relating to train movement, track, station and schedule are networked and computerized.\n\n=== Electrical systems ===\nShinkansen uses a [[25 kV AC railway electrification|25 kV AC]] overhead power supply (20 kV AC on [[Mini-shinkansen]] lines), to overcome the limitations of the 1,500 V [[direct current]] used on the existing electrified narrow-gauge system. Power is distributed along the axles of the train to reduce the heavy axle loads under single power cars.<ref name=\"Smith\" /> The AC frequency of the power supply for the Tokaido Shinkansen is 60&nbsp;Hz.\n\n=== Trains ===\nShinkansen trains are [[electric multiple unit]]s, offering fast acceleration, deceleration and reduced damage to the track because of the use of lighter vehicles compared to locomotives or power cars. The coaches are air-sealed to ensure stable air pressure when entering tunnels at high speed.\n[[File:Close look at Shinkansen coaches.JPG|thumb|A passenger's view of Shinkansen coaches]]\n\n=== Punctuality ===\nThe Shinkansen is very reliable thanks to several factors, including its near-total separation from slower traffic. In 2016, [[JR Central]] reported that the Shinkansen's average delay from schedule per train was 24 seconds. This includes delays due to uncontrollable causes, such as natural disasters.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://english.jr-central.co.jp/company/ir/annualreport/_pdf/annualreport2016.pdf|title=Central Japan Railway Company Annual Report 2016|page=18|accessdate=24 July 2016}}</ref> The record, in 1997, was 18 seconds.\n\n=== Traction ===\nThe Shinkansen has used the [[electric multiple unit]] configuration from the outset, with the [[0 Series Shinkansen]] having all axles powered. Other railway manufacturers were traditionally reluctant, or unable to use distributed traction configurations ([[Talgo]], the German [[ICE 2]] and the French (and subsequently South Korean) [[TGV]] (and [[KTX-I]] and [[KTX-II]]) use the [[locomotive]] (also known as power car) configuration with the [[AVE Class 102]] and continues with it for the [[Talgo AVRIL]] on account of the fact that it is not possible to use powered bogies as part of Talgo's bogie design, which uses a modified [[Jacobs bogie]] with a single axle instead of two and allows the wheels to rotate independently of each other, on the ICE 2, TGV and KTX it is because it easily allows for a high ride quality and less electrical equipment.<ref>http://www.ejrcf.or.jp/jrtr/jrtr17/pdf/f40_technology.pdf</ref>) In Japan, significant engineering desirability exists for the electric multiple unit configuration. A greater proportion of motored axles results in higher acceleration, meaning that the Shinkansen does not lose as much time if stopping frequently. Shinkansen lines have more stops in proportion to their lengths than high-speed lines elsewhere in the world.\n\n=== Safety record ===\nOver the Shinkansen's 50-plus year history, carrying over 10&nbsp;billion passengers, there have been no passenger fatalities due to train accidents such as derailments or collisions,<ref name=\"Safety\"/> despite frequent earthquakes and typhoons. Injuries and a single fatality have been caused by doors closing on passengers or their belongings; attendants are employed at platforms to prevent such accidents.<ref>{{citation |url= https://www.japantimes.co.jp/news/2001/03/08/national/railway-to-pay-for-1995-fatality/ |newspaper=[[The Japan Times]] |date=March 8, 2001 |title= Railway to pay for 1995 fatality; Shinkansen victim's parents win 49 million yen in damages  }}</ref> There have, however, been suicides by passengers jumping both from and in front of moving trains.<ref name=\"fact\">{{cite web|url=http://factsanddetails.com/japan.php?itemid=852&catid=23&subcatid=153|title=Shinkansen (Japanese Bullet Trains) and Maglev Magnetic Trains |url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://archive.is/20130122174638/http://factsanddetails.com/japan.php?itemid=852&catid=23&subcatid=153 |archivedate=22 January 2013 |df=dmy-all}}</ref> On 30 June 2015, a passenger committed suicide on board a Shinkansen train by setting himself on fire, killing another passenger and seriously injuring seven other people.<ref name=BBC33322794>{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-33322794 |title=Japan bullet train passenger starts fire injuring eight |work=BBC News Online |accessdate=30 June 2015}}</ref>\n\nThere have been two derailments of Shinkansen trains in passenger service.

Shinkansen lines, particularly in the very crowded coastal [[Taiheiy\u014d Belt]] [[megalopolis (city type)|megalopolis]], met two primary goals:\n\n* Shinkansen trains reduced the congestion burden on regional transportation by increasing throughput on a minimal land footprint, therefore being economically preferable compared to modes (such as airports or highways) common in less densely populated regions of the world. \n* As rail was already the primary urban mode of passenger travel, from that perspective it was akin to a [[sunk cost]]; there was not a significant number of motorists to convince to switch modes. The initial megalopolitan Shinkansen lines were profitable and paid for themselves. Connectivity rejuvenated rural towns such as [[Kakegawa, Shizuoka|Kakegawa]] that would otherwise be too distant from major cities.<ref name=\"jrtr-okada\"/>\n\nHowever, upon the introduction of the 1973 Basic Plan the initial prudence in developing Shinkansen lines gave way to political considerations to extend the mode to far less populated regions of the country, partly to spread these benefits beyond the key centres of [[Kant\u014d region|Kanto]] and [[Kinki]]. Although in some cases regional extension was frustrated by protracted land acquisition issues (sometimes influenced by the cancellation of the Narita Shinkansen following fierce protests by locals), over time Shinkansen lines were built to relatively sparsely populated areas with the intent the network would disperse the population away from the capital.\n\nSuch expansion had a significant cost. JNR, the national railway company, was already burdened with subsidizing unprofitable rural and regional railways. Additionally it assumed Shinkansen construction debt to the point the government corporation eventually owed some {{JPY|28 trillion}}, contributing to it being regionalised and privatized in 1987.<ref name=\"jrtr-kakumoto\">{{cite web |url=http://www.jrtr.net/jrtr22/F23_Kakumoto.html |title=Sensible Politics and Transport Theories? |publisher=Jrtr.net |accessdate=30 November 2009 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090606151933/http://www.jrtr.net/jrtr22/F23_Kakumoto.html |archive-date=6 June 2009 |url-status=dead |df=dmy-all }}</ref> The privatized JRs eventually paid a total of {{JPY|9.2 trillion}} to acquire JNR's Shinkansen network.<ref name=\"jrtr-okada\"/>\n\nFollowing privatization, the JR group of companies have continued Shinkansen network expansion to less populated areas, but with far more flexibility to [[Corporate spin-off|spin off]] unprofitable railways or cut costs than in JNR days. Currently an important factor is the post [[Japanese asset price bubble|bubble]] [[zero interest-rate policy]] that allows JR to borrow huge sums of capital without significant concern regarding [[Amortization schedule|repayment timing]].\n\n=== Environmental impact ===\nTraveling by the Tokaido Shinkansen from Tokyo to Osaka produces only around 16% of the [[carbon dioxide]] of the equivalent journey by car, a saving of 15,000 tons of {{co2}} per year.<ref name=\"jrtr-okada\"/>\n\n== Challenges encountered ==\n\n=== Noise pollution ===\n[[Noise pollution]] concerns mean that increasing speed is becoming more difficult. In Japan, the [[population density]] is high and there have been severe protests against the Shinkansen's noise pollution, meaning that its noise is now limited to less than 70 [[Decibel|dB]] in residential areas.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.env.go.jp/kijun/oto3.html |title=\u65b0\u5e79\u7dda\u9244\u9053\u9a12\u97f3\u306b\u4fc2\u308b\u74b0\u5883\u57fa\u6e96\u306b\u3064\u3044\u3066\uff08\u662d\u548c50\u5e74\u74b0\u5883\u5e81\u544a\u793a\uff09 The Environmental Regulation of Shinkansen Noise Pollution (1975, Environmental Agency) (Japanese) |publisher=Env.go.jp |date= |accessdate=30 November 2009}}</ref>\nHence, improvement and reduction of the [[pantograph (rail)|pantograph]], weight saving of cars, and construction of [[noise barrier]]s and other measures have been implemented. Current research is primarily aimed at reducing operational noise, particularly the [[Piston effect#Tunnel boom|tunnel boom]] phenomenon caused when trains transit tunnels at high speed.\n\n=== Earthquake ===\nBecause of the risk of earthquakes, the Urgent Earthquake Detection and Alarm System (UrEDAS) ([[earthquake warning system]]) was introduced in 1992. It enables automatic braking of bullet trains in the case of large earthquakes.\n\n=== Heavy snow ===\nThe [[T\u014dkaid\u014d Shinkansen]] often experiences heavy snow in the area around [[Maibara Station]] in winter. Trains have to reduce speed, which can disrupt the timetable. Sprinkler systems were later installed, but delays of 10 to 20 minutes still occur during snowy weather. Additionally, treefalls related to excess snow have caused service interruptions. Along the route of the [[J\u014detsu Shinkansen]], winter snow can be very heavy, with snow depths of two to three metres, so the line is equipped with stronger sprinklers and [[Ballastless track|slab track]], to mitigate the effects of deep snow.\n\n== Ridership ==\n\n===Annual===\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:right\"\n|+  Annual ridership figures for selected years (in million of passengers)<ref name=\"mlit\">{{cite web |url=http://www.mlit.go.jp/k-toukei/10/10a0excel.html |title=\u56fd\u571f\u4ea4\u901a\u7701\u9244\u9053\u8f38\u9001\u7d71\u8a08\u5e74\u5831\uff08\u5e73\u621019\u5e74\u5ea6\uff09 |access-date=19 December 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110514103232/http://www.mlit.go.jp/k-toukei/10/10a0excel.html |archive-date=14 May 2011 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n! !!

Shinkansen services to these lines traverse the [[Tohoku Shinkansen]] line from Tokyo before branching off to traditional main lines. On both the Yamagata/Shinjo and Akita lines, the narrow gauge lines were regauged, resulting in the local services being operated by [[701 series#701-5000 series|standard gauge versions]] of 1,067&nbsp;mm gauge suburban/interurban rolling stock. On the Akita line between Omagari and Akita, one of the two narrow gauge lines was regauged, and a section of the remaining narrow gauge line is dual gauge, providing the opportunity for Shinkansen services to pass each other without stopping.\n\nThe maximum speed on these lines is 130&nbsp;km/h, however the overall travel time to/from Tokyo is improved due to the elimination of the need for passengers to change trains at [[Fukushima, Fukushima|Fukushima]] and [[Morioka, Iwate|Morioka]] respectively.\n\nAs the [[Loading gauge]] (size of the train that can travel on a line) was not altered when the rail gauge was widened, only Shinkansen trains specially built for these routes can travel on the lines. At present they are the E3 and E6 series trains.\n\nWhilst no further Mini-shinkansen routes have been proposed to date, it remains an option for providing Shinkansen services to cities on the narrow gauge network.\n\n=== Gauge Change Train ===\n{{Main|Gauge Change Train}}\n\nThis is the name for the concept of using a single train that is specially designed to travel on both {{RailGauge|1067mm}} narrow gauge railway lines and the {{RailGauge|1435mm}} standard gauge used by Shinkansen train services in Japan. The trucks/bogies of the Gauge Change Train (GCT) allow the wheels to be unlocked from the axles, narrowed or widened as necessary, and then relocked. This allows a GCT to traverse both standard gauge and narrow gauge tracks without the expense of regauging lines.\n\nThree test trains have been constructed, with the second set having completed reliability trials on the [[Yosan Line]] east of [[Matsuyama, Ehime|Matsuyama]] (in [[Shikoku]]) in September 2013.

While no construction work was ever started, land along the proposed track, including an underground section leading to Shinjuku Station, remains reserved. If capacity on the current Tokyo\u2013\u014cmiya section proves insufficient, at some point, construction of the Shinjuku\u2013\u014cmiya link may be reconsidered.\n\nThe [[Narita Shinkansen]] project to connect Tokyo to [[Narita International Airport]], initiated in the 1970s but halted in 1983 after landowner protests, has been officially cancelled and removed from the Basic Plan governing Shinkansen construction. Parts of its planned right-of-way were used by the [[Narita Sky Access Line]] which opened in 2010. Although the Sky Access Line uses standard-gauge track, it was not built to Shinkansen specifications and there are no plans to convert it into a full Shinkansen line.\n\nIn December 2009, then transport minister [[Seiji Maehara]] proposed a bullet train link to [[Haneda Airport]], using an existing spur that connects the [[T\u014dkaid\u014d Shinkansen]] to a train depot.

has several advantages, including scheduling frequency and flexibility, punctual operation, comfortable seats, and convenient city-centre terminals.\n\nShinkansen fares are generally competitive with domestic air fares. From a speed and convenience perspective, the Shinkansen's market share has surpassed that of air travel for journeys of less than 750&nbsp;km, while air and rail remain highly competitive with each other in the 800\u2013900&nbsp;km range and air has a higher market share for journeys of more than 1,000&nbsp;km.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Shiomi|first1=Eiji|title=Do Faster Trains Challenge Air Carriers?|url=http://www.jrtr.net/jrtr19/F04_Shiomi.html|website=Japan Railway & Transport Review|accessdate=7 August 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150930083648/http://www.jrtr.net/jrtr19/F04_Shiomi.html|archive-date=30 September 2015|url-status=dead|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\n* Tokyo \u2013 Nagoya (342&nbsp;km), Tokyo \u2013 Sendai (325&nbsp;km), Tokyo \u2013 [[Hanamaki, Iwate|Hanamaki]] ([[Morioka, Iwate|Morioka]]) (496&nbsp;km), Tokyo \u2013 Niigata (300&nbsp;km): There were air services between these cities, but they were withdrawn after Shinkansen services started. Shinkansen runs between these cities in about two hours or less.\n* Tokyo \u2013 Osaka (515&nbsp;km): Shinkansen is dominant because of fast (2 hours 22 minutes) and frequent service (up to every 10 minutes by ''Nozomi''); however, air travel has a certain share (~20\u201330%).\n* Tokyo \u2013 Okayama (676&nbsp;km), Tokyo \u2013 Hiroshima (821&nbsp;km): Shinkansen is reported to have increased its market share from ~40% to ~60% over the last decade.<ref name=\"asia.nikkei.com\">{{cite web |url=http://asia.nikkei.com/Business/Trends/Japanese-airlines-facing-threat-from-below |title=Japanese airlines facing threat from below- Nikkei Asian Review |publisher=Asia.nikkei.com |date=25 November 2013 |accessdate=7 February 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140301141326/http://asia.nikkei.com/Business/Trends/Japanese-airlines-facing-threat-from-below |archive-date=1 March 2014 |url-status=dead |df=dmy-all }}</ref> The Shinkansen takes about three to four hours and there are ''Nozomi'' trains every 30 minutes, but airlines may provide cheaper fares, attracting price-conscious passengers.\n* Tokyo \u2013 Fukuoka (1,069&nbsp;km): The Shinkansen takes about five hours on the fastest ''Nozomi'', and discount carriers have made air travel far cheaper, so most people choose air. Additionally, unlike many cities, there is very little convenience advantage for the location of the Shinkansen stations of the two cities as [[Fukuoka Airport]] is located near the central [[Tenjin, Fukuoka|Tenjin]] district, and [[Fukuoka City Subway]] [[K\u016bk\u014d Line (Fukuoka City Subway)|Line 1]] connects the Airport and Tenjin via Hakata Station and [[Haneda Airport]] is similarly conveniently located.\n* Osaka \u2013 Fukuoka (554&nbsp;km): One of the most competitive sections. The Shinkansen takes about two and a half hours by ''Nozomi'' or ''Mizuho'', and the JR West ''Hikari Rail Star'' or JR West/JR Kyushu ''Sakura'' trains operate twice an hour, taking about 2 hours and 40 minutes between the two cities. Again the location of the airports involved helps with the popularity of air travel.\n* Tokyo \u2013 Aomori (675&nbsp;km): The fastest Shinkansen service between these cities is 3 hours.

Because of the mountainous terrain, the existing network consisted of {{RailGauge|1067mm|lk=on}} narrow-gauge lines, which generally took indirect routes and could not be adapted to higher speeds. Consequently, Japan had a greater need for new high-speed lines than countries where the existing [[standard gauge]] or [[broad gauge]] rail system had more upgrade potential.\n\nAmong the key people credited with the construction of the first Shinkansen are [[Hideo Shima]], the Chief Engineer, and [[Shinji Sog\u014d]], the first President of [[Japanese National Railways]] (JNR) who managed to persuade politicians to back the plan. Other significant people responsible for its technical development were Tadanao Miki, Tadashi Matsudaira, and Hajime Kawanabe based at the [[Railway Technical Research Institute]] (RTRI), part of JNR. They were responsible for much of the technical development of the first line, the [[T\u014dkaid\u014d Shinkansen]]. All three had worked on aircraft design during [[World War II]].<ref name=\"Hood\">{{Cite book | last = Hood | first = Christopher P. | title = Shinkansen \u2013 From Bullet Train to Symbol of Modern Japan | series = Routledge Contemporary Japan Series | publisher = Routledge | location=London | url =https://books.google.com/books?id=cwbklrvmS-oC | year = 2007 | isbn = 978-0-415-32052-8 | pages = 18\u201343}}</ref>\n\n=== Early proposals ===\nThe popular English name ''bullet train'' is a literal translation of the Japanese term {{Nihongo|''dangan ressha''|\u5f3e\u4e38\u5217\u8eca}}, a nickname given to the project while it was initially being discussed in the 1930s. The name stuck because of the original [[0 Series Shinkansen]]'s resemblance to a bullet and its high speed.\n\nThe ''Shinkansen'' name was first formally used in 1940 for a proposed standard gauge passenger and freight line between Tokyo and [[Shimonoseki]] that would have used steam and electric locomotives with a top speed of {{convert|200|km/h|mph|abbr=on}}. Over the next three years, the Ministry of Railways drew up more ambitious plans to extend the line to Beijing (through a [[Japan\u2013Korea Undersea Tunnel|tunnel to Korea]]) and even [[Singapore]], and build connections to the [[Trans-Siberian Railway]] and other trunk lines in Asia. These plans were abandoned in 1943 as Japan's position in World War II worsened. However, some construction did commence on the line; several tunnels on the present-day Shinkansen date to the war-era project.\n\n=== Construction ===\nFollowing the end of World War II, high-speed rail was forgotten for several years while traffic of passengers and freight steadily increased on the conventional [[T\u014dkaid\u014d Main Line]] along with the reconstruction of Japanese industry and economy. By the mid-1950s the T\u014dkaid\u014d Line was operating at full capacity, and the Ministry of Railways decided to revisit the Shinkansen project. In 1957, [[Odakyu Electric Railway]] introduced its [[Odakyu 3000 series SE|3000 series SE]] [[Romancecar]] train, setting a world speed record of {{convert|145|km/h|mph|0|abbr=on}} for a narrow gauge train. This train gave designers the confidence that they could safely build an even faster standard gauge train. Thus the first Shinkansen, the 0 series, was built on the success of the Romancecar.\n\nIn the 1950s, the Japanese national attitude was that railways would soon be outdated and replaced by air travel and highways as in America and many countries in Europe. However, [[Shinji Sog\u014d]], President of [[Japanese National Railways]], insisted strongly on the possibility of [[high-speed rail]], and the Shinkansen project was implemented.\n\nGovernment approval came in December 1958, and construction of the first segment of the [[T\u014dkaid\u014d Shinkansen]] between Tokyo and [[Osaka]] started in April 1959. The cost of constructing the Shinkansen was at first estimated at nearly 200 billion yen, which was raised in the form of a government loan, railway bonds and a low-interest loan of US$80 million from the [[World Bank]]. Initial cost estimates, however, had been deliberately understated and the actual figures were nearly double at about 400 billion yen. As the budget shortfall became clear in 1963, Sogo resigned to take responsibility.<ref name=\"Smith\">{{Cite journal |last=Smith |first = Roderick A. |title = The Japanese Shinkansen |journal = The Journal of Transport History |volume =24/2 |issue =2 |pages = 222\u2013236 |publisher = Imperial College, London |year = 2003 |doi =10.7227/TJTH.24.2.6 }}</ref>\n\nA test facility for rolling stock, now part of the line, opened in [[Odawara, Kanagawa|Odawara]] in 1962.\n\n=== Initial success ===\n[[File:JNR 19641001 Table1.png|thumb|1964 JNR Passenger Timetable, Table 1, showing shinkansen service on the New Tokaido Line]]\nThe T\u014dkaid\u014d Shinkansen began service on 1 October 1964, in time for the [[1964 Summer Olympics|first Tokyo Olympics]].<ref>Fukada, Takahiro, \"[http://search.japantimes.co.jp/cgi-bin/nn20081209i1.html Shinkansen about more than speed]\", ''[[The Japan Times]]'', 9 December 2008, p. 3.</ref> The conventional Limited Express service took six hours and 40 minutes from Tokyo to Osaka, but the Shinkansen made the trip in just four hours, shortened to three hours and ten minutes by 1965.

Prime Minister [[Kakuei Tanaka]] was an ardent supporter of the Shinkansen, and his government proposed an extensive network paralleling most existing trunk lines. Two new lines, the [[T\u014dhoku Shinkansen]] and [[J\u014detsu Shinkansen]], were built following this plan. Many other planned lines were delayed or scrapped entirely as [[Japanese National Railways|JNR]] slid into debt throughout the late 1970s, largely because of the high cost of building the Shinkansen network. By the early 1980s, the company was practically insolvent, leading to its privatization in 1987.\n\nDevelopment of the Shinkansen by the privatised regional JR companies has continued, with new train models developed, each generally with its own distinctive appearance (such as the [[500 Series Shinkansen|500 series]] introduced by [[JR West]]). Since 2014, Shinkansen trains run regularly at speeds up to {{convert|320|km/h|mph|round=5|abbr=on}} on the [[T\u014dhoku Shinkansen]], only the [[Shanghai maglev train]] and [[China Railway High-speed]] networks have commercial services that operate faster.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.cntraveler.com/stories/2016-05-18/the-10-fastest-trains-in-the-world |title=The 10 fastest trains in the world |publisher=cntraveler.com |date= |accessdate=8 December 2019}}</ref> \n\nSince 1970, development has also been underway for the [[Ch\u016b\u014d Shinkansen]], a planned [[maglev]] line from Tokyo to Osaka. On 21 April 2015, a seven-car [[L0 series]] maglev trainset set a [[Land speed record for railed vehicles|world speed record]] of {{convert|603|km/h|mph|0|abbr=on}}.<ref name=\"guardian20150421\"/>\n\n== Technology ==\nTo enable high-speed operation Shinkansen uses a range of advanced technology compared with conventional rail, achieving not only high speed but also a high standard of safety and comfort. Its success has influenced other railways in the world and the importance and advantage of [[high-speed rail]] has consequently been reevaluated.\n\n=== Routing ===\nShinkansen routes are completely separate from conventional rail lines (except [[Mini-shinkansen]] which goes through to conventional lines). Consequently, the shinkansen is not affected by slower local or freight trains (except for [[Hokkaido Shinkansen]] while traveling through the [[Seikan Tunnel]]), and has the capacity to operate many high-speed trains punctually. The lines have been built without [[level crossing|road crossings at grade]]. Tracks are strictly off-limits with penalties against trespassing strictly regulated by law. It uses tunnels and [[viaduct]]s to go through and over obstacles rather than around them, with a minimum curve radius of 4,000&nbsp;meters (2,500&nbsp;meters on the oldest T\u014dkaid\u014d Shinkansen).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.jrtr.net/jrtr11/history.html|title=Railway Modernization and Shinkansen|publisher=Japan Railway & Transport Review|date=30 April 2011|accessdate=30 April 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110613154641/http://www.jrtr.net/jrtr11/history.html|archive-date=13 June 2011|url-status=dead|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\n=== Track ===\n[[File:Toyohashi Station 001.JPG|thumb|Shinkansen [[standard gauge]] track, with welded rails to reduce vibration]]\nThe Shinkansen uses {{RailGauge|1435mm}} [[standard gauge]] in contrast to the {{RailGauge|1067mm}} narrow gauge of older lines. [[Continuous welded rail]] and [[swingnose crossing]] points are employed, eliminating gaps at turnouts and crossings. Long rails are used, joined by expansion joints to minimize gauge fluctuation due to thermal elongation and shrinkage.\n\nA combination of [[track ballast|ballasted]] and [[slab track]] is used, with slab track exclusively employed on concrete bed sections such as viaducts and tunnels. Slab track is significantly more cost-effective in tunnel sections, since the lower track height reduces the cross-sectional area of the tunnel, thereby reducing construction costs by up to 30%.<ref>Miura, S., Takai, H., Uchida, M., and Fukada, Y. The Mechanism of Railway Tracks. Japan Railway & Transport Review, 15, 38\u201345, 1998</ref>\nHowever, the smaller diameter of Shinkansen tunnels compared to some other high-speed lines has resulted in the issue of [[Piston effect|tunnel boom]] becoming a concern for residents living close to tunnel portals.\n\nThe slab track consists of rails, fasteners and track slabs with a cement asphalt mortar. On the roadbed and in tunnels, circular upstands (measuring 400\u2013520&nbsp;mm in diameter and 200&nbsp;mm high) are located at 5 metre intervals. The \nprefabricated upstands are made of either [[reinforced concrete]] or pre-stressed reinforced concrete; they prevent the track slab from moving along either the latitudinal or the longitudinal directions. One track slab weighs approximately 5 tons, measuring 2220\u20132340&nbsp;mm wide, 4900\u20134950&nbsp;mm long and 160\u2013200&nbsp;mm thick.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Ando |first1=Katsutoshi |display-authors=etal |date=2001 |title=Development of Slab Tracks for Hokuriku Shinkansen Line |journal=Quarterly Report of RTRI |volume=42 |issue=1 |pages=35\u201341 |doi=10.2219/rtriqr.42.35 }}</ref>\n\n=== Signal system ===\n[[File:ATC TEC.png|thumb|Braking curve for the original ATC-1 used on the [[Tokaido Shinkansen]] (vertical axis represents the speed of the train whereas the horizontal axis represents the distance)]]\n[[File:\u65b0\u5e79\u7dda\u7dcf\u5408\u6307\u4ee4\u6240(\u4eac\u90fd\u9244\u9053\u535a\u7269\u9928).jpg|thumb|Replica of the Shinkansen CTC as seen at the [[Kyoto Railway Museum]]]]\nThe Shinkansen employs an [[Automatic Train Control|ATC]] (Automatic Train Control) system, eliminating the need for trackside signals. It uses a comprehensive system of [[Automatic Train Protection]].<ref name=\"Smith\" /> [[Centralized traffic control]] manages all train operations, and all tasks relating to train movement, track, station and schedule are networked and computerized.\n\n=== Electrical systems ===\nShinkansen uses a [[25 kV AC railway electrification|25 kV AC]] overhead power supply (20 kV AC on [[Mini-shinkansen]] lines), to overcome the limitations of the 1,500 V [[direct current]] used on the existing electrified narrow-gauge system. Power is distributed along the axles of the train to reduce the heavy axle loads under single power cars.<ref name=\"Smith\" /> The AC frequency of the power supply for the Tokaido Shinkansen is 60&nbsp;Hz.\n\n=== Trains ===\nShinkansen trains are [[electric multiple unit]]s, offering fast acceleration, deceleration and reduced damage to the track because of the use of lighter vehicles compared to locomotives or power cars. The coaches are air-sealed to ensure stable air pressure when entering tunnels at high speed.\n[[File:Close look at Shinkansen coaches.JPG|thumb|A passenger's view of Shinkansen coaches]]\n\n=== Punctuality ===\nThe Shinkansen is very reliable thanks to several factors, including its near-total separation from slower traffic. In 2016, [[JR Central]] reported that the Shinkansen's average delay from schedule per train was 24 seconds. This includes delays due to uncontrollable causes, such as natural disasters.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://english.jr-central.co.jp/company/ir/annualreport/_pdf/annualreport2016.pdf|title=Central Japan Railway Company Annual Report 2016|page=18|accessdate=24 July 2016}}</ref> The record, in 1997, was 18 seconds.\n\n=== Traction ===\nThe Shinkansen has used the [[electric multiple unit]] configuration from the outset, with the [[0 Series Shinkansen]] having all axles powered. Other railway manufacturers were traditionally reluctant, or unable to use distributed traction configurations ([[Talgo]], the German [[ICE 2]] and the French (and subsequently South Korean) [[TGV]] (and [[KTX-I]] and [[KTX-II]]) use the [[locomotive]] (also known as power car) configuration with the [[AVE Class 102]] and continues with it for the [[Talgo AVRIL]] on account of the fact that it is not possible to use powered bogies as part of Talgo's bogie design, which uses a modified [[Jacobs bogie]] with a single axle instead of two and allows the wheels to rotate independently of each other, on the ICE 2, TGV and KTX it is because it easily allows for a high ride quality and less electrical equipment.<ref>http://www.ejrcf.or.jp/jrtr/jrtr17/pdf/f40_technology.pdf</ref>) In Japan, significant engineering desirability exists for the electric multiple unit configuration. A greater proportion of motored axles results in higher acceleration, meaning that the Shinkansen does not lose as much time if stopping frequently. Shinkansen lines have more stops in proportion to their lengths than high-speed lines elsewhere in the world.\n\n=== Safety record ===\nOver the Shinkansen's 50-plus year history, carrying over 10&nbsp;billion passengers, there have been no passenger fatalities due to train accidents such as derailments or collisions,<ref name=\"Safety\"/> despite frequent earthquakes and typhoons.

Shinkansen lines, particularly in the very crowded coastal [[Taiheiy\u014d Belt]] [[megalopolis (city type)|megalopolis]], met two primary goals:\n\n* Shinkansen trains reduced the congestion burden on regional transportation by increasing throughput on a minimal land footprint, therefore being economically preferable compared to modes (such as airports or highways) common in less densely populated regions of the world. \n* As rail was already the primary urban mode of passenger travel, from that perspective it was akin to a [[sunk cost]]; there was not a significant number of motorists to convince to switch modes. The initial megalopolitan Shinkansen lines were profitable and paid for themselves. Connectivity rejuvenated rural towns such as [[Kakegawa, Shizuoka|Kakegawa]] that would otherwise be too distant from major cities.<ref name=\"jrtr-okada\"/>\n\nHowever, upon the introduction of the 1973 Basic Plan the initial prudence in developing Shinkansen lines gave way to political considerations to extend the mode to far less populated regions of the country, partly to spread these benefits beyond the key centres of [[Kant\u014d region|Kanto]] and [[Kinki]]. Although in some cases regional extension was frustrated by protracted land acquisition issues (sometimes influenced by the cancellation of the Narita Shinkansen following fierce protests by locals), over time Shinkansen lines were built to relatively sparsely populated areas with the intent the network would disperse the population away from the capital.\n\nSuch expansion had a significant cost. JNR, the national railway company, was already burdened with subsidizing unprofitable rural and regional railways. Additionally it assumed Shinkansen construction debt to the point the government corporation eventually owed some {{JPY|28 trillion}}, contributing to it being regionalised and privatized in 1987.<ref name=\"jrtr-kakumoto\">{{cite web |url=http://www.jrtr.net/jrtr22/F23_Kakumoto.html |title=Sensible Politics and Transport Theories? |publisher=Jrtr.net |accessdate=30 November 2009 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090606151933/http://www.jrtr.net/jrtr22/F23_Kakumoto.html |archive-date=6 June 2009 |url-status=dead |df=dmy-all }}</ref> The privatized JRs eventually paid a total of {{JPY|9.2 trillion}} to acquire JNR's Shinkansen network.<ref name=\"jrtr-okada\"/>\n\nFollowing privatization, the JR group of companies have continued Shinkansen network expansion to less populated areas, but with far more flexibility to [[Corporate spin-off|spin off]] unprofitable railways or cut costs than in JNR days. Currently an important factor is the post [[Japanese asset price bubble|bubble]] [[zero interest-rate policy]] that allows JR to borrow huge sums of capital without significant concern regarding [[Amortization schedule|repayment timing]].\n\n=== Environmental impact ===\nTraveling by the Tokaido Shinkansen from Tokyo to Osaka produces only around 16% of the [[carbon dioxide]] of the equivalent journey by car, a saving of 15,000 tons of {{co2}} per year.<ref name=\"jrtr-okada\"/>\n\n== Challenges encountered ==\n\n=== Noise pollution ===\n[[Noise pollution]] concerns mean that increasing speed is becoming more difficult. In Japan, the [[population density]] is high and there have been severe protests against the Shinkansen's noise pollution, meaning that its noise is now limited to less than 70 [[Decibel|dB]] in residential areas.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.env.go.jp/kijun/oto3.html |title=\u65b0\u5e79\u7dda\u9244\u9053\u9a12\u97f3\u306b\u4fc2\u308b\u74b0\u5883\u57fa\u6e96\u306b\u3064\u3044\u3066\uff08\u662d\u548c50\u5e74\u74b0\u5883\u5e81\u544a\u793a\uff09 The Environmental Regulation of Shinkansen Noise Pollution (1975, Environmental Agency) (Japanese) |publisher=Env.go.jp |date= |accessdate=30 November 2009}}</ref>\nHence, improvement and reduction of the [[pantograph (rail)|pantograph]], weight saving of cars, and construction of [[noise barrier]]s and other measures have been implemented. Current research is primarily aimed at reducing operational noise, particularly the [[Piston effect#Tunnel boom|tunnel boom]] phenomenon caused when trains transit tunnels at high speed.\n\n=== Earthquake ===\nBecause of the risk of earthquakes, the Urgent Earthquake Detection and Alarm System (UrEDAS) ([[earthquake warning system]]) was introduced in 1992. It enables automatic braking of bullet trains in the case of large earthquakes.\n\n=== Heavy snow ===\nThe [[T\u014dkaid\u014d Shinkansen]] often experiences heavy snow in the area around [[Maibara Station]] in winter. Trains have to reduce speed, which can disrupt the timetable. Sprinkler systems were later installed, but delays of 10 to 20 minutes still occur during snowy weather. Additionally, treefalls related to excess snow have caused service interruptions. Along the route of the [[J\u014detsu Shinkansen]], winter snow can be very heavy, with snow depths of two to three metres, so the line is equipped with stronger sprinklers and [[Ballastless track|slab track]], to mitigate the effects of deep snow.\n\n== Ridership ==\n\n===Annual===\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:right\"\n|+  Annual ridership figures for selected years (in million of passengers)<ref name=\"mlit\">{{cite web |url=http://www.mlit.go.jp/k-toukei/10/10a0excel.html |title=\u56fd\u571f\u4ea4\u901a\u7701\u9244\u9053\u8f38\u9001\u7d71\u8a08\u5e74\u5831\uff08\u5e73\u621019\u5e74\u5ea6\uff09 |access-date=19 December 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110514103232/http://www.mlit.go.jp/k-toukei/10/10a0excel.html |archive-date=14 May 2011 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n! !!

The 211.3&nbsp;km extension will be approximately 76% in tunnels, including major tunnels such as Oshima (~26.5&nbsp;km), Teine (~18.8&nbsp;km) and Shiribeshi (~18&nbsp;km).<ref>http://www.mlit.go.jp/common/000215188.pdf</ref>\n\nAlthough an extension from Sapporo to Asahikawa was included in the 1973 list of planned lines, at this time it is unknown whether the Hokkaido Shinkansen will be extended beyond Sapporo.\n\n=== Nagasaki Shinkansen ===\n[[JR Kyushu]] is constructing an extension (to be known as the West Kyushu Shinkansen) line of the [[Kyushu Shinkansen]] to {{STN|Nagasaki|Nagasaki}}, partly to full Shinkansen standard gauge construction standards (Takeo Onsen \u2013 Nagasaki) with the existing narrow gauge section between Shin-Tosu and Takeo Onsen to be upgraded as part of this project.\n\nThis proposal initially involved introducing [[Gauge Change Train]]s (GCT) travelling from Hakata to Shin-Tosu (26.3&nbsp;km) on the existing Kyushu Shinkansen line, then passing through a specific gauge changing (standard to narrow) section of track linking to the existing [[Nagasaki Main Line]], along which it would travel to Hizen Yamaguchi (37.6&nbsp;km), then onto the [[Sasebo Line]] to Takeo Onsen (13.7&nbsp;km), where another gauge changing section (narrow to standard) would lead onto the final Shinkansen line to Nagasaki (66.7&nbsp;km). However, technical issues with the development of the GCT bogies means the train will not be available for service until at least 2025, requiring consideration of other options such as [[Tsubame (train)#Relay Tsubame|'relay']] service to ensure the line can open on schedule in fiscal 2022.<ref name=\"ajw.asahi.com\">{{cite web|url=http://ajw.asahi.com/article/behind_news/social_affairs/AJ201602240076 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2016-11-23 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160225105059/http://ajw.asahi.com/article/behind_news/social_affairs/AJ201602240076 |archivedate=25 February 2016 }}</ref>\n\nThe proposal shortens the distance between Hakata and Nagasaki by 6.2% (9.6&nbsp;km), and while only 64% of the route will be built to full Shinkansen standards, it will eliminate the slowest sections of the existing narrow gauge route. Use of the GCT was estimated to result in a time saving of 28.5% (32 minutes) on the current timetable. The proposed time saving if a 'relay' service is introduced is unknown at this time.\n\nAs part of this proposal, the current 12.8&nbsp;km section of single track between Hizen Yamaguchi and Takeo Onsen is proposed to be duplicated. However, due to the delay in the development of the GCT, the proposal has not advanced.\n\nWith the completion of excavation of the 1351m Enogushi tunnel, being the sixth tunnel completed in this section, approximately 25% of the 40.7&nbsp;km of tunnel excavation work on the Takeo Onsen \u2013 Nagasaki section has been finished.

Shinkansen services to these lines traverse the [[Tohoku Shinkansen]] line from Tokyo before branching off to traditional main lines. On both the Yamagata/Shinjo and Akita lines, the narrow gauge lines were regauged, resulting in the local services being operated by [[701 series#701-5000 series|standard gauge versions]] of 1,067&nbsp;mm gauge suburban/interurban rolling stock. On the Akita line between Omagari and Akita, one of the two narrow gauge lines was regauged, and a section of the remaining narrow gauge line is dual gauge, providing the opportunity for Shinkansen services to pass each other without stopping.\n\nThe maximum speed on these lines is 130&nbsp;km/h, however the overall travel time to/from Tokyo is improved due to the elimination of the need for passengers to change trains at [[Fukushima, Fukushima|Fukushima]] and [[Morioka, Iwate|Morioka]] respectively.\n\nAs the [[Loading gauge]] (size of the train that can travel on a line) was not altered when the rail gauge was widened, only Shinkansen trains specially built for these routes can travel on the lines. At present they are the E3 and E6 series trains.\n\nWhilst no further Mini-shinkansen routes have been proposed to date, it remains an option for providing Shinkansen services to cities on the narrow gauge network.\n\n=== Gauge Change Train ===\n{{Main|Gauge Change Train}}\n\nThis is the name for the concept of using a single train that is specially designed to travel on both {{RailGauge|1067mm}} narrow gauge railway lines and the {{RailGauge|1435mm}} standard gauge used by Shinkansen train services in Japan. The trucks/bogies of the Gauge Change Train (GCT) allow the wheels to be unlocked from the axles, narrowed or widened as necessary, and then relocked. This allows a GCT to traverse both standard gauge and narrow gauge tracks without the expense of regauging lines.\n\nThree test trains have been constructed, with the second set having completed reliability trials on the [[Yosan Line]] east of [[Matsuyama, Ehime|Matsuyama]] (in [[Shikoku]]) in September 2013. The third set was undertaking gauge changing trials at [[Shin-Yatsushiro Station]] (on [[Kyushu]]), commencing in 2014 for a proposed three-year period, however testing was suspended in December 2014 after accumulating approximating 33,000&nbsp;km, following the discovery of defective thrust bearing oil seals on the bogies.<ref name=\"mynavi20141224\">{{cite web |url= http://news.mynavi.jp/news/2014/12/24/335/ |script-title=ja:\u4e5d\u5dde\u65b0\u5e79\u7dda\u306e\u30d5\u30ea\u30fc\u30b2\u30fc\u30b8\u30c8\u30ec\u30a4\u30f3\u3001\u6b20\u640d\u304c\u898b\u3064\u304b\u308a\u8010\u4e45\u8d70\u884c\u8a66\u9a13\u3092\u4e00\u6642\u4f11\u6b62 |trans-title= Kyushu Shinkansen Free Gauge Train endurance testing suspended following discovery of defects |date= 24 December 2014|work= Mynavi News|publisher= Mynavi Corporation |location= Japan|language= Japanese|accessdate= 27 December 2014}}</ref> The train was being trialled between [[Kumamoto]], travelling on the narrow gauge line to Shin-Yatsushiro, where a gauge changer has been installed, so the GCT could then be trialled on the Shinkansen line to [[Kagoshima]].

Parts of its planned right-of-way were used by the [[Narita Sky Access Line]] which opened in 2010. Although the Sky Access Line uses standard-gauge track, it was not built to Shinkansen specifications and there are no plans to convert it into a full Shinkansen line.\n\nIn December 2009, then transport minister [[Seiji Maehara]] proposed a bullet train link to [[Haneda Airport]], using an existing spur that connects the [[T\u014dkaid\u014d Shinkansen]] to a train depot. [[JR Central]] called the plan \"unrealistic\" due to tight train schedules on the existing line, but reports said that Maehara wished to continue discussions on the idea.<ref>{{Cite news|title= Maehara sounds out JR Tokai over shinkansen link for Haneda airport|newspaper= Japan Today|date= 28 December 2009|url= http://www.japantoday.com/category/national/view/maehara-sounds-out-jr-tokai-over-shinkansen-link-for-haneda-airport|accessdate= 28 December 2009}}{{dead link|date=May 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref> The current minister has not indicated whether this proposal remains supported. While the plan may become more feasible after the opening the Chuo Shinkansen (sometimes referred to as a bypass to the Tokaido Shinkansen) frees up capacity, construction is already underway for other rail improvements between Haneda and Tokyo station expected to be completed prior to the opening of the 2020 Tokyo Olympics, so any potential Shinkansen service would likely offer only marginal benefit beyond that.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!rowspan=2|Line\n!colspan=2|Speed\n!colspan=2|Length\n!rowspan=2|Construction began/proposed\n!rowspan=2|Expected start of revenue services\n|-\n!km/h\n!mph\n!km\n!mi\n|-\n| [[Kyushu Shinkansen]] (West Kyushu Route)\n|{{convert|260|km/h|mph|disp=table}}\n|{{convert|66.7|km|mi|disp=table}} \n|2009 \n|FY2022\n|-\n| [[Hokuriku Shinkansen]] Phase 3 (Kanazawa \u2013 Tsuruga)\n|{{convert|260|km/h|mph|disp=table}}\n|{{convert|120.7|km|mi|disp=table}} \n|2012 \n|FY2023\n|-\n| [[Hokkaido Shinkansen]] Phase 2 (Shin-Hakodate-Hokuto \u2013 Sapporo)\n|{{convert|260|km/h|mph|disp=table}}\n|{{convert|211.3|km|mi|disp=table}}\n|2012 \n|FY2030\n|-\n| Hokuriku Shinkansen Phase 4 (Tsuruga \u2013 Obama \u2013 Kyoto \u2013 Shin-Osaka)\n|{{convert|260|km/h|mph|disp=table}}\n|{{TBD|disp=table}}\n|{{TBD|disp=table}} \n|2030 \n|FY2045\n|}\n\n== List of train types ==\nTrains are up to sixteen cars long.

has several advantages, including scheduling frequency and flexibility, punctual operation, comfortable seats, and convenient city-centre terminals.\n\nShinkansen fares are generally competitive with domestic air fares. From a speed and convenience perspective, the Shinkansen's market share has surpassed that of air travel for journeys of less than 750&nbsp;km, while air and rail remain highly competitive with each other in the 800\u2013900&nbsp;km range and air has a higher market share for journeys of more than 1,000&nbsp;km.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Shiomi|first1=Eiji|title=Do Faster Trains Challenge Air Carriers?|url=http://www.jrtr.net/jrtr19/F04_Shiomi.html|website=Japan Railway & Transport Review|accessdate=7 August 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150930083648/http://www.jrtr.net/jrtr19/F04_Shiomi.html|archive-date=30 September 2015|url-status=dead|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\n* Tokyo \u2013 Nagoya (342&nbsp;km), Tokyo \u2013 Sendai (325&nbsp;km), Tokyo \u2013 [[Hanamaki, Iwate|Hanamaki]] ([[Morioka, Iwate|Morioka]]) (496&nbsp;km), Tokyo \u2013 Niigata (300&nbsp;km): There were air services between these cities, but they were withdrawn after Shinkansen services started. Shinkansen runs between these cities in about two hours or less.\n* Tokyo \u2013 Osaka (515&nbsp;km): Shinkansen is dominant because of fast (2 hours 22 minutes) and frequent service (up to every 10 minutes by ''Nozomi''); however, air travel has a certain share (~20\u201330%).\n* Tokyo \u2013 Okayama (676&nbsp;km), Tokyo \u2013 Hiroshima (821&nbsp;km): Shinkansen is reported to have increased its market share from ~40% to ~60% over the last decade.<ref name=\"asia.nikkei.com\">{{cite web |url=http://asia.nikkei.com/Business/Trends/Japanese-airlines-facing-threat-from-below |title=Japanese airlines facing threat from below- Nikkei Asian Review |publisher=Asia.nikkei.com |date=25 November 2013 |accessdate=7 February 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140301141326/http://asia.nikkei.com/Business/Trends/Japanese-airlines-facing-threat-from-below |archive-date=1 March 2014 |url-status=dead |df=dmy-all }}</ref> The Shinkansen takes about three to four hours and there are ''Nozomi'' trains every 30 minutes, but airlines may provide cheaper fares, attracting price-conscious passengers.\n* Tokyo \u2013 Fukuoka (1,069&nbsp;km): The Shinkansen takes about five hours on the fastest ''Nozomi'', and discount carriers have made air travel far cheaper, so most people choose air. Additionally, unlike many cities, there is very little convenience advantage for the location of the Shinkansen stations of the two cities as [[Fukuoka Airport]] is located near the central [[Tenjin, Fukuoka|Tenjin]] district, and [[Fukuoka City Subway]] [[K\u016bk\u014d Line (Fukuoka City Subway)|Line 1]] connects the Airport and Tenjin via Hakata Station and [[Haneda Airport]] is similarly conveniently located.\n* Osaka \u2013 Fukuoka (554&nbsp;km): One of the most competitive sections. The Shinkansen takes about two and a half hours by ''Nozomi'' or ''Mizuho'', and the JR West ''Hikari Rail Star'' or JR West/JR Kyushu ''Sakura'' trains operate twice an hour, taking about 2 hours and 40 minutes between the two cities. Again the location of the airports involved helps with the popularity of air travel.\n* Tokyo \u2013 Aomori (675&nbsp;km): The fastest Shinkansen service between these cities is 3 hours.
