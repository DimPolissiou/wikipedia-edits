It is the 56th [[List of Walt Disney Animation Studios films|Disney animated feature film]]. Directed by [[Ron Clements]] and [[John Musker]], co-directed by [[Don Hall (filmmaker)|Don Hall]] and [[Chris Williams (director)|Chris Williams]], the film introduces [[Auli\u02bbi Cravalho]] as Moana and features the voices of [[Dwayne Johnson]], [[Rachel House (actress)|Rachel House]], [[Temuera Morrison]], [[Jemaine Clement]], [[Nicole Scherzinger]], and [[Alan Tudyk]]. The film features songs written by [[Lin-Manuel Miranda]], [[Te Vaka|Opetaia Foa'i]] and [[Mark Mancina]], and an orchestral score also composed by Mancina.\n\nThe film tells the story of [[Moana (Disney character)|Moana]], the strong-willed daughter of a chief of a [[Polynesians|Polynesian]] village, who is chosen by the ocean itself to reunite a mystical relic with the goddess Te Fiti. When a [[blight]] strikes her island, Moana sets sail in search of [[M\u0101ui (mythology)|Maui]], a legendary [[demigod]], in the hope of returning the relic to Te Fiti and saving her people.\n\n''Moana'' was released theatrically in the United States on November 23, 2016 to positive reviews from critics, with particular praise going towards its animation, music, and vocal performances. The film went on to gross over $690&nbsp;million worldwide. Along with ''[[Zootopia]]'', it marked the first time since 2002 that Walt Disney Animation Studios released two feature films in the same year. It received two [[Academy Awards|Academy Award]] nominations at the [[89th Academy Awards]]: one for [[Academy Award for Best Animated Feature|Best Animated Feature]] and another for [[Academy Award for Best Original Song|Best Original Song]] (\"[[How Far I'll Go]]\").<ref>{{cite news|url=https://variety.com/2017/film/news/2017-oscar-nominations-academy-awards-nominees-1201968107/|title=Oscar Nominations: Complete List|date=January 24, 2017|work=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]|publisher=Variety Media|location=Los Angeles|accessdate=January 24, 2017}}</ref>\n\n==Plot==\n<!-- Per WP:FILMPLOT, plots should be between 400 and 700 words. Please do not add more material to this summary; instead, adjust what is already here. -->\nOn the [[Polynesia]]n island of Motunui, the inhabitants worship the goddess Te Fiti, who brought life to the ocean using a [[pounamu]] stone as her heart and the source of her power. [[M\u0101ui (mythology)|Maui]], the shape-shifting demigod and master of sailing, steals the heart to give humanity the power of creation. However, Te Fiti disintegrates, and Maui is attacked by another who seeks the heart: Te K\u0101, a volcanic demon. Maui is blasted out of the sky, losing both his magical giant [[fishhook]] and the heart to the depths of the sea.\n\nA millennium later, the ocean chooses Moana, daughter of Motunui's chief Tui, to return the heart to Te Fiti. Tui takes Moana away, causing her to lose the heart. Tui and Sina, Moana's mother, try to keep her away from the ocean to prepare her for ascension as the island's chief. Sixteen years later, a [[blight]] strikes the island, killing vegetation and shrinking the fish catch. Moana suggests going beyond the island's reef to find more fish and figure out what is happening, but Tui forbids it. Moana tries conquering the reef but is overpowered by the tides and shipwrecked back to Motunui with Pua the pig.\n\nMoana's grandmother, Tala, shows her a secret cave of ships, revealing that their people were voyagers until Maui stole Te Fiti's heart; the ocean was no longer safe without it. Tala explains that Te K\u0101's darkness is poisoning the island, but can be cured if Moana finds Maui and makes him restore the heart of Te Fiti, which she gives to Moana. Tala falls ill and, on her death bed, tells Moana that she must depart to find Maui.\n\nSetting sail on a [[camakau]] from the cavern, Moana is caught in a typhoon and shipwrecked on an island where she finds Maui, who boasts about his achievements. She demands that Maui return the heart, but he refuses and traps her in a cave. She escapes and confronts Maui, who reluctantly lets her on the camakau. They are attacked by Kakamora\u2014small, coconut-armored pirates\u2014who seek the heart, but Moana and Maui outwit them. Moana realizes Maui is no longer a hero since he stole the heart and cursed the world, and convinces him to redeem himself by returning the heart. Maui first needs to retrieve his magical [[fishhook]] in Lalotai, the Realm of Monsters, from Tamatoa, a giant [[coconut crab]]. While Moana distracts Tamatoa, Maui retrieves his hook but discovers he can no longer control his shape-shifting. He is overpowered by Tamatoa, but Moana's quick thinking allows them to escape with the hook. Maui reveals that his first tattoo was earned when his mortal parents rejected him. After reassurance from Moana, Maui teaches her the art of sailing, regaining control of his powers, and the two grow closer.\n\nThey arrive at Te Fiti's island, only to be attacked by Te K\u0101. Moana refuses to turn back, resulting in Maui's hook being badly damaged. Unwilling to lose his hook in another confrontation with Te K\u0101, Maui abandons Moana, who tearfully asks the ocean to find someone else to restore the heart. The ocean obliges and takes the heart, but Tala's spirit appears, inspiring Moana to find her true calling. She retrieves the heart and sails back to confront Te K\u0101. Maui returns, having had a change of heart, and buys Moana time to reach Te Fiti by fighting Te K\u0101, destroying his hook in the process. Moana discovers Te Fiti is missing, and realizes Te K\u0101 is Te Fiti, corrupted without her heart. Moana tells the ocean to clear a path, allowing her to return Te Fiti's heart, and the restored goddess heals the ocean and islands of the blight. Maui apologizes to Te Fiti, who restores his hook and gives Moana a new boat before falling into a deep sleep and becoming a mountain.\n\nMoana bids farewell to Maui, returning home where she reunites with her parents. She takes up her role as chief and [[Polynesian navigation|wayfinder]], leading her people as they resume voyaging.\n\n==Cast==\n[[File:Auli'i Cravalho December 2016.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Auli\u02bbi Cravalho]] at the film's premiere in [[Samoa]] in December 2016]]\n* [[Auli\u02bbi Cravalho]] as Moana, the curious daughter of village chief Tui and his wife Sina, who is chosen by the ocean to restore the heart of Te Fiti\n** Cravalho reprised her role in the [[Hawaiian language|Hawaiian-language]] version of the movie.<ref name=\"instagram\">{{cite web|url=https://www.instagram.com/p/BbAOujigpkd/|title=Auli'i on Instagram: 'Aloha nui k\u0101kou!

The film features songs written by [[Lin-Manuel Miranda]], [[Te Vaka|Opetaia Foa'i]] and [[Mark Mancina]], and an orchestral score also composed by Mancina.\n\nThe film tells the story of [[Moana (Disney character)|Moana]], the strong-willed daughter of a chief of a [[Polynesians|Polynesian]] village, who is chosen by the ocean itself to reunite a mystical relic with the goddess Te Fiti. When a [[blight]] strikes her island, Moana sets sail in search of [[M\u0101ui (mythology)|Maui]], a legendary [[demigod]], in the hope of returning the relic to Te Fiti and saving her people.\n\n''Moana'' was released theatrically in the United States on November 23, 2016 to positive reviews from critics, with particular praise going towards its animation, music, and vocal performances.

Please do not add more material to this summary; instead, adjust what is already here. -->\nOn the [[Polynesia]]n island of Motunui, the inhabitants worship the goddess Te Fiti, who brought life to the ocean using a [[pounamu]] stone as her heart and the source of her power. [[M\u0101ui (mythology)|Maui]], the shape-shifting demigod and master of sailing, steals the heart to give humanity the power of creation. However, Te Fiti disintegrates, and Maui is attacked by another who seeks the heart: Te K\u0101, a volcanic demon. Maui is blasted out of the sky, losing both his magical giant [[fishhook]] and the heart to the depths of the sea.\n\nA millennium later, the ocean chooses Moana, daughter of Motunui's chief Tui, to return the heart to Te Fiti. Tui takes Moana away, causing her to lose the heart. Tui and Sina, Moana's mother, try to keep her away from the ocean to prepare her for ascension as the island's chief. Sixteen years later, a [[blight]] strikes the island, killing vegetation and shrinking the fish catch. Moana suggests going beyond the island's reef to find more fish and figure out what is happening, but Tui forbids it. Moana tries conquering the reef but is overpowered by the tides and shipwrecked back to Motunui with Pua the pig.\n\nMoana's grandmother, Tala, shows her a secret cave of ships, revealing that their people were voyagers until Maui stole Te Fiti's heart; the ocean was no longer safe without it. Tala explains that Te K\u0101's darkness is poisoning the island, but can be cured if Moana finds Maui and makes him restore the heart of Te Fiti, which she gives to Moana. Tala falls ill and, on her death bed, tells Moana that she must depart to find Maui.\n\nSetting sail on a [[camakau]] from the cavern, Moana is caught in a typhoon and shipwrecked on an island where she finds Maui, who boasts about his achievements. She demands that Maui return the heart, but he refuses and traps her in a cave. She escapes and confronts Maui, who reluctantly lets her on the camakau. They are attacked by Kakamora\u2014small, coconut-armored pirates\u2014who seek the heart, but Moana and Maui outwit them. Moana realizes Maui is no longer a hero since he stole the heart and cursed the world, and convinces him to redeem himself by returning the heart. Maui first needs to retrieve his magical [[fishhook]] in Lalotai, the Realm of Monsters, from Tamatoa, a giant [[coconut crab]]. While Moana distracts Tamatoa, Maui retrieves his hook but discovers he can no longer control his shape-shifting. He is overpowered by Tamatoa, but Moana's quick thinking allows them to escape with the hook. Maui reveals that his first tattoo was earned when his mortal parents rejected him. After reassurance from Moana, Maui teaches her the art of sailing, regaining control of his powers, and the two grow closer.\n\nThey arrive at Te Fiti's island, only to be attacked by Te K\u0101. Moana refuses to turn back, resulting in Maui's hook being badly damaged. Unwilling to lose his hook in another confrontation with Te K\u0101, Maui abandons Moana, who tearfully asks the ocean to find someone else to restore the heart. The ocean obliges and takes the heart, but Tala's spirit appears, inspiring Moana to find her true calling. She retrieves the heart and sails back to confront Te K\u0101. Maui returns, having had a change of heart, and buys Moana time to reach Te Fiti by fighting Te K\u0101, destroying his hook in the process. Moana discovers Te Fiti is missing, and realizes Te K\u0101 is Te Fiti, corrupted without her heart. Moana tells the ocean to clear a path, allowing her to return Te Fiti's heart, and the restored goddess heals the ocean and islands of the blight. Maui apologizes to Te Fiti, who restores his hook and gives Moana a new boat before falling into a deep sleep and becoming a mountain.\n\nMoana bids farewell to Maui, returning home where she reunites with her parents. She takes up her role as chief and [[Polynesian navigation|wayfinder]], leading her people as they resume voyaging.\n\n==Cast==\n[[File:Auli'i Cravalho December 2016.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Auli\u02bbi Cravalho]] at the film's premiere in [[Samoa]] in December 2016]]\n* [[Auli\u02bbi Cravalho]] as Moana, the curious daughter of village chief Tui and his wife Sina, who is chosen by the ocean to restore the heart of Te Fiti\n** Cravalho reprised her role in the [[Hawaiian language|Hawaiian-language]] version of the movie.<ref name=\"instagram\">{{cite web|url=https://www.instagram.com/p/BbAOujigpkd/|title=Auli'i on Instagram: 'Aloha nui k\u0101kou!

Melford''' (born '''George Henry Knauff''', February 19, 1877 \u2013 April 25, 1961) was an American stage and film actor, director, producer, and screenwriter. Often taken for granted as a director today, the stalwart Melford's name by the 1920s was, like Cecil B. DeMille's, appearing in big bold letters above the title of his films.<ref>{{cite news |title=Lost Film Files #23: Burning Sands (1922)|work=MOVIES SILENTLY Celebrate Silent Film|author=Kramer, Fritzi|date=December 30, 2013|accessdate=August 12, 2019| url=http://moviessilently.com/tag/george-melford/}}</ref>\n\n==Early years==\nBorn in [[Rochester, New York]], in 1877 (though older sources state 1888), he was the son of German immigrant Henrietta Knauff. Melford had four sisters: Mary Knauff (Mrs. Godfrey Willis Wainwright); Henrietta Knauff; Alice Irene Knauff (Mrs. Edmond Francois Bernoudy) \u2014 all of Los Angeles \u2014 and Mrs. Frederick Kells/Keils of Ottawa, Canada. Melford graduated from [[McGill University]] in [[Montreal, Quebec]], Canada.{{Citation needed |date=September 2019}}\n\n== Career ==\nHe was an accomplished stage actor working in [[Cincinnati, Ohio]], before joining the [[Kalem Company]] motion picture studio in New York City in 1909. Hired by director [[Sidney Olcott]] for [[character actor]] roles, in the fall of 1910 he was sent to work with a film crew on the [[West Coast of the United States|West Coast]]. In 1911, with [[Robert Vignola]], he co-directed [[Ruth Roland]] in his first short film, ''Arizona Bill'' based on a script he had written. From there, Melford went on to direct another 30 films for Kalem Studios until 1915, when he was hired by [[Jesse L. Lasky]] to direct feature-length films for Lasky's [[Paramount Pictures|Feature Play Company]]. That same year, Melford became one of the founding members of the [[Motion Picture Directors Association]].\n[[File:The Sheik with Agnes Ayres and Rudolph Valentino, movie poster, 1921.jpg|thumb|upright|left|Poster for ''[[The Sheik (film)|The Sheik]]'' (1921), directed by George Melford]]\nIn 1916 Melford directed ''[[To Have and to Hold (1916 film)|To Have and to Hold]]'', a film based on the [[Mary Johnston]] novel that had been the [[List of bestselling novels in the United States|bestselling novel in the United States]] for 1900. In 1921 he directed what is probably his most famous [[silent film]]\u2014''[[The Sheik (film)|The Sheik]]'', starring [[Rudolph Valentino]].\n\nMelford remained with Lasky's company for ten years, then joined [[Universal Pictures]], where he directed his first [[Sound film|talkie]] in 1929. The following year, he co-directed four Spanish-language films including the acclaimed [[Dracula (1931 Spanish-language film)|Spanish version of ''Dracula'']]. Melford filmed it simultaneously with the English version on the same sets at night using a different cast and crew. Somewhat of a controversy has arisen about this film. Some sources say that Melford was assigned the job because he could speak Spanish, but other sources claim that Melford could not speak a word of Spanish and had to use a translator to communicate with the actors. The issue was cleared up when actress [[Lupita Tovar]]\u2014who was in the film\u2014said in an interview on the 75th anniversary DVD of the film that Melford, in fact, did not speak Spanish and had to use a translator.\n\nHis last major work as a director came in 1937 when he and [[Harry L. Fraser]] co-directed [[Columbia Pictures]]' first [[Serial (film)|serial]], a 15-episode, five-hour-long [[adventure film]] titled [[Jungle Menace]] starring [[Frank Buck (animal collector)|Frank Buck]]. At age 60, the [[workaholic]] Melford needed to slow down and decided to give up the stressful job of directing to take on simple [[character actor]] roles. However, in 1946, Harry Fraser convinced him to co-direct \"''Jungle Terror'',\" a feature-length sequel to their successful ''Jungle Menace'' serial.\n\n==Later career and death==\nMelford loved the film business, and although financially independent, he never stopped working. Having directed more than 140 films, he continued to work in small character roles.  In the 1940s he was part of [[Preston Sturges]]' unofficial [[Preston Sturges Unofficial Stock Company Actors|\"stock company\" of character actors]], appearing in six films written and directed by Sturges.{{efn|Melford appeared in ''[[The Great McGinty]]'', ''[[The Lady Eve]]'', ''[[The Miracle of Morgan's Creek]]'', ''[[Hail the Conquering Hero]]'', ''[[Unfaithfully Yours (1948 film)|Unfaithfully Yours]]'', ''[[The Beautiful Blonde from Bashful Bend]]'', Sturges' last American film. Earlier, Melford had also appeared in ''[[Remember the Night]]'', which Sturges wrote.}} He also made a notable appearance in the 1956 epic ''[[The Ten Commandments (1956 movie)|The Ten Commandments]]''.\n\nHe appeared in his last film in 1960 at the age of 83,{{Citation needed |date=September 2019}} dying in Hollywood on April 25, 1961, of heart failure at age 84. He is interred in [[Valhalla Memorial Park Cemetery]] in [[North Hollywood, Los Angeles, California]].<ref>{{cite book |last1=Ellenberger |first1=Allan R. |title=Celebrities in Los Angeles Cemeteries: A Directory |date=2001 |publisher=McFarland |isbn=9780786409839 |page=206 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8bOJCgAAQBAJ&pg=PA206&dq=%22George+Melford%22+actor&hl=en&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwiYzI6BmtnkAhWRfCsKHas7Dg0Q6AEwAHoECAEQAg#v=onepage&q=%22George%20Melford%22%20actor&f=false |accessdate=September 17, 2019 |language=en}}</ref>\n\n==Personal life==\nOn May 9, 1904, Melford married Louise Leroy.

Melford''' (born '''George Henry Knauff''', February 19, 1877 \u2013 April 25, 1961) was an American stage and film actor, director, producer, and screenwriter. Often taken for granted as a director today, the stalwart Melford's name by the 1920s was, like Cecil B. DeMille's, appearing in big bold letters above the title of his films.<ref>{{cite news |title=Lost Film Files #23: Burning Sands (1922)|work=MOVIES SILENTLY Celebrate Silent Film|author=Kramer, Fritzi|date=December 30, 2013|accessdate=August 12, 2019| url=http://moviessilently.com/tag/george-melford/}}</ref>\n\n==Early years==\nBorn in [[Rochester, New York]], in 1877 (though older sources state 1888), he was the son of German immigrant Henrietta Knauff. Melford had four sisters: Mary Knauff (Mrs. Godfrey Willis Wainwright); Henrietta Knauff; Alice Irene Knauff (Mrs. Edmond Francois Bernoudy) \u2014 all of Los Angeles \u2014 and Mrs. Frederick Kells/Keils of Ottawa, Canada. Melford graduated from [[McGill University]] in [[Montreal, Quebec]], Canada.{{Citation needed |date=September 2019}}\n\n== Career ==\nHe was an accomplished stage actor working in [[Cincinnati, Ohio]], before joining the [[Kalem Company]] motion picture studio in New York City in 1909. Hired by director [[Sidney Olcott]] for [[character actor]] roles, in the fall of 1910 he was sent to work with a film crew on the [[West Coast of the United States|West Coast]]. In 1911, with [[Robert Vignola]], he co-directed [[Ruth Roland]] in his first short film, ''Arizona Bill'' based on a script he had written. From there, Melford went on to direct another 30 films for Kalem Studios until 1915, when he was hired by [[Jesse L. Lasky]] to direct feature-length films for Lasky's [[Paramount Pictures|Feature Play Company]]. That same year, Melford became one of the founding members of the [[Motion Picture Directors Association]].\n[[File:The Sheik with Agnes Ayres and Rudolph Valentino, movie poster, 1921.jpg|thumb|upright|left|Poster for ''[[The Sheik (film)|The Sheik]]'' (1921), directed by George Melford]]\nIn 1916 Melford directed ''[[To Have and to Hold (1916 film)|To Have and to Hold]]'', a film based on the [[Mary Johnston]] novel that had been the [[List of bestselling novels in the United States|bestselling novel in the United States]] for 1900. In 1921 he directed what is probably his most famous [[silent film]]\u2014''[[The Sheik (film)|The Sheik]]'', starring [[Rudolph Valentino]].\n\nMelford remained with Lasky's company for ten years, then joined [[Universal Pictures]], where he directed his first [[Sound film|talkie]] in 1929. The following year, he co-directed four Spanish-language films including the acclaimed [[Dracula (1931 Spanish-language film)|Spanish version of ''Dracula'']]. Melford filmed it simultaneously with the English version on the same sets at night using a different cast and crew. Somewhat of a controversy has arisen about this film. Some sources say that Melford was assigned the job because he could speak Spanish, but other sources claim that Melford could not speak a word of Spanish and had to use a translator to communicate with the actors. The issue was cleared up when actress [[Lupita Tovar]]\u2014who was in the film\u2014said in an interview on the 75th anniversary DVD of the film that Melford, in fact, did not speak Spanish and had to use a translator.\n\nHis last major work as a director came in 1937 when he and [[Harry L. Fraser]] co-directed [[Columbia Pictures]]' first [[Serial (film)|serial]], a 15-episode, five-hour-long [[adventure film]] titled [[Jungle Menace]] starring [[Frank Buck (animal collector)|Frank Buck]]. At age 60, the [[workaholic]] Melford needed to slow down and decided to give up the stressful job of directing to take on simple [[character actor]] roles. However, in 1946, Harry Fraser convinced him to co-direct \"''Jungle Terror'',\" a feature-length sequel to their successful ''Jungle Menace'' serial.\n\n==Later career and death==\nMelford loved the film business, and although financially independent, he never stopped working. Having directed more than 140 films, he continued to work in small character roles.  In the 1940s he was part of [[Preston Sturges]]' unofficial [[Preston Sturges Unofficial Stock Company Actors|\"stock company\" of character actors]], appearing in six films written and directed by Sturges.{{efn|Melford appeared in ''[[The Great McGinty]]'', ''[[The Lady Eve]]'', ''[[The Miracle of Morgan's Creek]]'', ''[[Hail the Conquering Hero]]'', ''[[Unfaithfully Yours (1948 film)|Unfaithfully Yours]]'', ''[[The Beautiful Blonde from Bashful Bend]]'', Sturges' last American film. Earlier, Melford had also appeared in ''[[Remember the Night]]'', which Sturges wrote.}} He also made a notable appearance in the 1956 epic ''[[The Ten Commandments (1956 movie)|The Ten Commandments]]''.\n\nHe appeared in his last film in 1960 at the age of 83,{{Citation needed |date=September 2019}} dying in Hollywood on April 25, 1961, of heart failure at age 84. He is interred in [[Valhalla Memorial Park Cemetery]] in [[North Hollywood, Los Angeles, California]].<ref>{{cite book |last1=Ellenberger |first1=Allan R. |title=Celebrities in Los Angeles Cemeteries: A Directory |date=2001 |publisher=McFarland |isbn=9780786409839 |page=206 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8bOJCgAAQBAJ&pg=PA206&dq=%22George+Melford%22+actor&hl=en&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwiYzI6BmtnkAhWRfCsKHas7Dg0Q6AEwAHoECAEQAg#v=onepage&q=%22George%20Melford%22%20actor&f=false |accessdate=September 17, 2019 |language=en}}</ref>\n\n==Personal life==\nOn May 9, 1904, Melford married Louise Leroy.

Hoyle was originally elected for the [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]], but in 2019 became the [[Speaker of the House of Commons (United Kingdom)|Speaker]], making him unaffiliated.\n\n==Boundaries==\n'''1885\u20131918''': The Sessional Division of Leyland Hundred, and part of the Sessional Division of Leyland.\n\n'''1918\u20131950''': The Municipal Borough of Chorley, the Urban Districts of Adlington, Croston, Leyland, and Withnell, the Rural District of Chorley, and in the Rural District of Wigan the civil parishes of Haigh, Parbold, Worthington, and Wrightington.\n\n'''1950\u20131983''': The Municipal Borough of Chorley, the Urban Districts of Adlington and Leyland, and the Rural District of Chorley.\n\n'''1983\u20131997''': The Borough of Chorley, and the District of West Lancashire wards of Parbold and Wrightington.\n\n'''1997\u20132010''': The Borough of Chorley.\n\n'''2010\u2013present''': The Borough of Chorley wards of Adlington and Anderton, Astley and Buckshaw, Brindle and Hoghton, Chisnall, Chorley East, Chorley North East, Chorley North West, Chorley South East, Chorley South West, Clayton-le-Woods and Whittle-le-Woods, Clayton-le-Woods North, Clayton-le-Woods West and Cuerden, Coppull, Euxton North, Euxton South, Heath Charnock and Rivington, Pennine, and Wheelton and Withnell.\n\nChorley constituency consists of the majority of the [[Chorley (borough)|borough of Chorley]]. As well as the central market town of Chorley itself, the seat extends into southern Lancashire rural hinterland with three major villages and minor villages.\n\nChorley's expansion is assured with the building of [[Buckshaw Village]], an urban development sprawling over the former Royal Ordnance Site east of [[Leyland, Lancashire|Leyland]] in the seat.\n\nFollowing their review of parliamentary representation in [[Lancashire]] leading up to the [[2010 United Kingdom general election]] the [[Boundary Commission for England]] created a new seat of [[Wyre and Preston North (UK Parliament constituency)|Wyre and Preston North]] in the central part of the county, which caused \"knock-on\" effects elsewhere. [[Chorley]] constituency was one of the largest in electorate at the start of the review, which was a factor in the alterations to both its own composition and the changes to surrounding constituencies. These changes took away from the seat all the areas to the west of the [[M6 motorway|M6]] motorway, namely [[Croston]], [[Eccleston, Lancashire|Eccleston]], [[Bretherton]] and [[Mawdesley]]. These move to [[South Ribble (UK Parliament constituency)|South Ribble]].\n\n==History==\nSince the [[1945 United Kingdom general election|1945 general election]] Chorley has proved to be a [[bellwether#United Kingdom|bellwether]], changing hands between Labour and the Conservatives; however, this pattern was broken in [[2010 United Kingdom general election|2010]] when Labour MP Lindsay Hoyle retained the seat against the national trend. Chorley itself is Labour's strongest seat in the area, with the rural hinterland and smaller towns and villages more inclined to vote Conservative.\n\n==Members of Parliament==\n[[Lindsay Hoyle]] has been [[Member of Parliament (United Kingdom)|MP]] for Chorley since [[1997 United Kingdom general election|1997]] as a member of the [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]]. In November 2019 Hoyle [[2019 Speaker of the British House of Commons election|was elected]] as [[Speaker of the House of Commons (United Kingdom)|Speaker of the House of Commons]] following the resignation of [[John Bercow]]; Sir Lindsay had been [[Deputy Speaker of the House of Commons]] under Bercow since 2010. \n\nThere is an inconsistently followed convention, which is mostly kept by the major parties, not to oppose the Speaker at elections. In keeping with this, the previously announced Liberal Democrat candidate, Paul Valentine, subsequently withdrew from the general election once Sir Lindsay was appointed Speaker.<ref>{{cite web |title=Twitter |url=https://mobile.twitter.com/iampav/status/1191457989091373062 |website=mobile.twitter.com}}</ref> However the Green Party candidate, James Melling, confirmed that he will stand against the incumbent Speaker.<ref>{{cite web |title=James Melling for Chorley |url=https://www.facebook.com/JamesMellingChorley/?hc_ref=ARRAt1OLzJ2DEG60mzJb1RHK4y5upqsMJJRcSttwBhK-T6nT60YrXJjSrLNJFR7EBR0&fref=nf&__xts__[0]=68.ARCeE0Snsyi7b2SlJdCs-5lXAvjQb-ffO1h3pgQvEuoKniKDOK6c4Qp4nwX9hw8D-0aP-wbp8ceXEh0xwWCiHg-y1xils6Xpv__93XB3ZGLXWGksSv2vkjvmKKwRwIt5MNt8NvyeEEL-zPOkAcZuuIsZWpcdIn6JaC1YuFq4YayxcXwz286yrB_OG7YpC9wA9Le8Ue60z5BPgVM38K6lq6oAboJG9R3yJJWgqSgZehrchwFw0pMoKTFxvgmN_cBcgiyFUOeu3iXq7AXDmbJPZ_i_O875TIJGVH_jdL5HciIEMwI8tyO_xJP2ibTLgsX88hKjEMhwwswaeX3On-AGmh-Ifi1_8moc_hIPdmu9OPsLoiU2cJCg6o9WSyMwyA63cdp4Lq2WU01SBd_zoHmNvxvsxYhpGJ_0A13MRKgOHkAKuloU-oKz79wKJSn8suffYhW_OU_tcYahb710eXNRW2mZnDgMm7gHWy4_hXfQC4aUUeekUvg&__tn__=kCH-R |website=www.facebook.com |language=en}}</ref>\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!colspan=\"2\"|Election\n!Member<ref>{{cite web|title=Chorley 1885\u2013|url=http://hansard.millbanksystems.com/constituencies/chorley|website=Hansard 1803\u20132005|publisher=UK Parliament|accessdate=2 February 2015}}</ref><ref name=\"rayment\">{{Rayment-hc|c|4|date=March 2012}}</ref>\n!Party\n|-\n| rowspan=\"3\" style=\"background-color: {{Conservative Party (UK)/meta/color}}\" |\n| [[1885 United Kingdom general election|1885]]\n| [[Joseph Feilden]]\n| rowspan=\"3\"|[[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative]]\n|-\n| 1895 by-election <!-- 7 June -->\n| [[David Lindsay, 27th Earl of Crawford|David Lindsay]]\n|-\n| [[1913 Chorley by-election|1913 by-election]] <!-- 19 February -->\n| [[Henry Hibbert]]\n|-\n| style=\"background-color: {{Coalition Conservative/meta/color}}\" |\n| [[1918 United Kingdom general election|1918]]\n| rowspan=\"2\"| [[Douglas Hacking, 1st Baron Hacking|Douglas Hacking]]\n| [[Coalition Conservative]]\n|-\n| style=\"background-color: {{Conservative Party (UK)/meta/color}}\" |\n| [[1922 United Kingdom general election|1922]]\n| [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative]]\n|-\n| style=\"background-color: {{Labour Party (UK)/meta/color}}\" |\n| [[1945 United Kingdom general election|1945]]\n| [[Clifford Kenyon]]\n| [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour]]\n|-\n| style=\"background-color: {{Conservative Party (UK)/meta/color}}\" |\n| [[1970 United Kingdom general election|1970]]\n| [[Constance Monks|Connie Monks]]\n| [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative]]\n|-\n| style=\"background-color: {{Labour Party (UK)/meta/color}}\" |\n| [[February 1974 United Kingdom general election|Feb 1974]]\n| [[George Rodgers (politician)|George Rodgers]]\n| [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour]]\n|-\n| style=\"background-color: {{Conservative Party (UK)/meta/color}}\" |\n| [[1979 United Kingdom general election|1979]]\n| [[Den Dover]]\n| [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative]]\n|-\n| style=\"background-color: {{Labour Party (UK)/meta/color}}\" |\n|[[1997 United Kingdom general election|1997]]\n| rowspan=\"2\" |[[Lindsay Hoyle]] \n| [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour]]\n|-\n| style=\"background-color: {{Speaker of the House of Commons (United Kingdom)/meta/color}}\" |\n|[[2019 United Kingdom general election|2019]]\n| [[Speaker of the House of Commons (United Kingdom)|Speaker]]\n|-\n|}\n\n==Elections==\n===Elections in the 2010s===\nThe Liberal Democrats, the Conservatives, and Labour traditionally do not stand against the sitting [[Speaker of the House of Commons (United Kingdom)|Speaker of the House of Commons]], and consequently did not oppose Lindsay Hoyle's re-election bid.

(for the purposes of election expenses and type of returning officer)|group= n}}{{#tag:ref|As with all constituencies, the constituency elects one [[Member of Parliament]] (MP) by the [[first past the post]] system of election at least every five years.|group= n}} in [[Lancashire]] represented in the [[House of Commons of the United Kingdom|House of Commons]] of the [[Parliament of the United Kingdom|UK Parliament]] since 1997 by [[Lindsay Hoyle]]. Hoyle was originally elected for the [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]], but in 2019 became the [[Speaker of the House of Commons (United Kingdom)|Speaker]], making him unaffiliated.\n\n==Boundaries==\n'''1885\u20131918''': The Sessional Division of Leyland Hundred, and part of the Sessional Division of Leyland.\n\n'''1918\u20131950''': The Municipal Borough of Chorley, the Urban Districts of Adlington, Croston, Leyland, and Withnell, the Rural District of Chorley, and in the Rural District of Wigan the civil parishes of Haigh, Parbold, Worthington, and Wrightington.\n\n'''1950\u20131983''': The Municipal Borough of Chorley, the Urban Districts of Adlington and Leyland, and the Rural District of Chorley.\n\n'''1983\u20131997''': The Borough of Chorley, and the District of West Lancashire wards of Parbold and Wrightington.\n\n'''1997\u20132010''': The Borough of Chorley.\n\n'''2010\u2013present''': The Borough of Chorley wards of Adlington and Anderton, Astley and Buckshaw, Brindle and Hoghton, Chisnall, Chorley East, Chorley North East, Chorley North West, Chorley South East, Chorley South West, Clayton-le-Woods and Whittle-le-Woods, Clayton-le-Woods North, Clayton-le-Woods West and Cuerden, Coppull, Euxton North, Euxton South, Heath Charnock and Rivington, Pennine, and Wheelton and Withnell.\n\nChorley constituency consists of the majority of the [[Chorley (borough)|borough of Chorley]]. As well as the central market town of Chorley itself, the seat extends into southern Lancashire rural hinterland with three major villages and minor villages.\n\nChorley's expansion is assured with the building of [[Buckshaw Village]], an urban development sprawling over the former Royal Ordnance Site east of [[Leyland, Lancashire|Leyland]] in the seat.\n\nFollowing their review of parliamentary representation in [[Lancashire]] leading up to the [[2010 United Kingdom general election]] the [[Boundary Commission for England]] created a new seat of [[Wyre and Preston North (UK Parliament constituency)|Wyre and Preston North]] in the central part of the county, which caused \"knock-on\" effects elsewhere. [[Chorley]] constituency was one of the largest in electorate at the start of the review, which was a factor in the alterations to both its own composition and the changes to surrounding constituencies. These changes took away from the seat all the areas to the west of the [[M6 motorway|M6]] motorway, namely [[Croston]], [[Eccleston, Lancashire|Eccleston]], [[Bretherton]] and [[Mawdesley]]. These move to [[South Ribble (UK Parliament constituency)|South Ribble]].\n\n==History==\nSince the [[1945 United Kingdom general election|1945 general election]] Chorley has proved to be a [[bellwether#United Kingdom|bellwether]], changing hands between Labour and the Conservatives; however, this pattern was broken in [[2010 United Kingdom general election|2010]] when Labour MP Lindsay Hoyle retained the seat against the national trend. Chorley itself is Labour's strongest seat in the area, with the rural hinterland and smaller towns and villages more inclined to vote Conservative.\n\n==Members of Parliament==\n[[Lindsay Hoyle]] has been [[Member of Parliament (United Kingdom)|MP]] for Chorley since [[1997 United Kingdom general election|1997]] as a member of the [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]]. In November 2019 Hoyle [[2019 Speaker of the British House of Commons election|was elected]] as [[Speaker of the House of Commons (United Kingdom)|Speaker of the House of Commons]] following the resignation of [[John Bercow]]; Sir Lindsay had been [[Deputy Speaker of the House of Commons]] under Bercow since 2010. \n\nThere is an inconsistently followed convention, which is mostly kept by the major parties, not to oppose the Speaker at elections. In keeping with this, the previously announced Liberal Democrat candidate, Paul Valentine, subsequently withdrew from the general election once Sir Lindsay was appointed Speaker.<ref>{{cite web |title=Twitter |url=https://mobile.twitter.com/iampav/status/1191457989091373062 |website=mobile.twitter.com}}</ref> However the Green Party candidate, James Melling, confirmed that he will stand against the incumbent Speaker.<ref>{{cite web |title=James Melling for Chorley |url=https://www.facebook.com/JamesMellingChorley/?hc_ref=ARRAt1OLzJ2DEG60mzJb1RHK4y5upqsMJJRcSttwBhK-T6nT60YrXJjSrLNJFR7EBR0&fref=nf&__xts__[0]=68.ARCeE0Snsyi7b2SlJdCs-5lXAvjQb-ffO1h3pgQvEuoKniKDOK6c4Qp4nwX9hw8D-0aP-wbp8ceXEh0xwWCiHg-y1xils6Xpv__93XB3ZGLXWGksSv2vkjvmKKwRwIt5MNt8NvyeEEL-zPOkAcZuuIsZWpcdIn6JaC1YuFq4YayxcXwz286yrB_OG7YpC9wA9Le8Ue60z5BPgVM38K6lq6oAboJG9R3yJJWgqSgZehrchwFw0pMoKTFxvgmN_cBcgiyFUOeu3iXq7AXDmbJPZ_i_O875TIJGVH_jdL5HciIEMwI8tyO_xJP2ibTLgsX88hKjEMhwwswaeX3On-AGmh-Ifi1_8moc_hIPdmu9OPsLoiU2cJCg6o9WSyMwyA63cdp4Lq2WU01SBd_zoHmNvxvsxYhpGJ_0A13MRKgOHkAKuloU-oKz79wKJSn8suffYhW_OU_tcYahb710eXNRW2mZnDgMm7gHWy4_hXfQC4aUUeekUvg&__tn__=kCH-R |website=www.facebook.com |language=en}}</ref>\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!colspan=\"2\"|Election\n!Member<ref>{{cite web|title=Chorley 1885\u2013|url=http://hansard.millbanksystems.com/constituencies/chorley|website=Hansard 1803\u20132005|publisher=UK Parliament|accessdate=2 February 2015}}</ref><ref name=\"rayment\">{{Rayment-hc|c|4|date=March 2012}}</ref>\n!Party\n|-\n| rowspan=\"3\" style=\"background-color: {{Conservative Party (UK)/meta/color}}\" |\n| [[1885 United Kingdom general election|1885]]\n| [[Joseph Feilden]]\n| rowspan=\"3\"|[[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative]]\n|-\n| 1895 by-election <!-- 7 June -->\n| [[David Lindsay, 27th Earl of Crawford|David Lindsay]]\n|-\n| [[1913 Chorley by-election|1913 by-election]] <!-- 19 February -->\n| [[Henry Hibbert]]\n|-\n| style=\"background-color: {{Coalition Conservative/meta/color}}\" |\n| [[1918 United Kingdom general election|1918]]\n| rowspan=\"2\"| [[Douglas Hacking, 1st Baron Hacking|Douglas Hacking]]\n| [[Coalition Conservative]]\n|-\n| style=\"background-color: {{Conservative Party (UK)/meta/color}}\" |\n| [[1922 United Kingdom general election|1922]]\n| [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative]]\n|-\n| style=\"background-color: {{Labour Party (UK)/meta/color}}\" |\n| [[1945 United Kingdom general election|1945]]\n| [[Clifford Kenyon]]\n| [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour]]\n|-\n| style=\"background-color: {{Conservative Party (UK)/meta/color}}\" |\n| [[1970 United Kingdom general election|1970]]\n| [[Constance Monks|Connie Monks]]\n| [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative]]\n|-\n| style=\"background-color: {{Labour Party (UK)/meta/color}}\" |\n| [[February 1974 United Kingdom general election|Feb 1974]]\n| [[George Rodgers (politician)|George Rodgers]]\n| [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour]]\n|-\n| style=\"background-color: {{Conservative Party (UK)/meta/color}}\" |\n| [[1979 United Kingdom general election|1979]]\n| [[Den Dover]]\n| [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative]]\n|-\n| style=\"background-color: {{Labour Party (UK)/meta/color}}\" |\n|[[1997 United Kingdom general election|1997]]\n| rowspan=\"2\" |[[Lindsay Hoyle]] \n| [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour]]\n|-\n| style=\"background-color: {{Speaker of the House of Commons (United Kingdom)/meta/color}}\" |\n|[[2019 United Kingdom general election|2019]]\n| [[Speaker of the House of Commons (United Kingdom)|Speaker]]\n|-\n|}\n\n==Elections==\n===Elections in the 2010s===\nThe Liberal Democrats, the Conservatives, and Labour traditionally do not stand against the sitting [[Speaker of the House of Commons (United Kingdom)|Speaker of the House of Commons]], and consequently did not oppose Lindsay Hoyle's re-election bid.

Pan-nationalism can occur as a specific variant of all common forms of nationalism. In relation to classical [[state nationalism]], pan-nationalism manifests itself through various political movements that are advocating the creation of \"higher\" (pan-national) forms of political identity, based on a regional or continental grouping of national states (for examples: [[Pan-Americanism]], [[Pan-Africanism]]), [[Pan-Arabism]], [[Pan-Iranism]]. In terms of [[ethnic nationalism]], pan-nationalism can also manifest itself through specific ethnic movements that are advocating the creation of \"higher\" (pan-national) forms of common identity that is based on [[ethnicity|ethnic]] grouping (for example: [[Pan-Germanism]] or [[Pan-Slavism]]). Other forms of nationalism also have their ''pan-national'' variants.\n\nSome forms of pan-nationalism, such as [[Pan-Germanism]], manifest themselves on two levels: wider - relating to the unity of all [[Germanic peoples]] - and narrower - relating to the unity of all ethnic [[Germans]], also including (on either of those two levels) German-speaking [[Austrians]] and German-speaking [[Swiss people]], many of who may not identify as strictly \"German\", while still belonging to the wider family of Germanic peoples. For adherents of [[Pan-Turkism]], by contrast, the marginalisation or suppression of separate national or ethnic identities of the non-[[Turkish people|Turkish]] [[Turkic peoples]], like the [[Kazakh people]] of Kazakhstan and the [[Kyrgyz people]] of Kyrgyzstan, {{Clarify span|text=is much less accepted by non-adherents of the ideology|reason=confusing non-sequitur run-on sentence. the role of the leading paragraphs is to simply explain the idea first. criticism can come in a later paragraph after the reader understands what the idea is.|date=September 2018}}\n\n==History and outcomes==\n[[Image:German1910.png|right|300px|thumb|German language area in 1910\u201311.

German pan-nationalists wanted to unite much of the green areas into one German nation-state.]]\n\nPan-nationalism emerged from the nineteenth-century [[Pan-European nationalism|European nationalism]], beginning with the [[Pan-Slavism]] movement, which developed among various Slavic nations within the [[Austria-Hungary|Austro-Hungarian]] and [[Ottoman Empire|Turkish]] empires.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite book|title=Political Ideology Today|last=Adams|first=Ian|publisher=Manchester University Press|year=2001|isbn=978-0719060199|location=Manchester|pages=[https://archive.org/details/politicalideolog0000adam/page/73 73]|url=https://archive.org/details/politicalideolog0000adam/page/73}}</ref> At the heart of this development was [[J\u00e1n Koll\u00e1r]], who maintained that the Slavs as a fundamentally single people, sharing the same cultural heritage.<ref name=\":0\" /> This was later followed by the Pan-German thought, which assumed a somewhat similar view, with a goal of German unification where a greater Germany can be created, including Austrians and other German speakers.<ref name=\":0\" /> These pan-nationalistic movements embraced the European intellectual discourses on race particularly those about the preservation of the racial unit.<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite book|title=Nationalism and Globalisation: Conflicting Or Complementary?|last=Halikiopoulou|first=Daphne|last2=Vasilopoulou|first2=Sofia|publisher=Routledge|year=2011|isbn=9780415581967|location=Oxon|pages=56}}</ref> This gave the concept a mantle of permanence because it called upon a biological connection that bound a \"Volk\" together.<ref name=\":1\" /> \n\nPan-nationalism implies that the national group is dispersed over several existing states. It is not identical to [[irredentism]] \u2013 nationalist claims on adjoining territories on the grounds that they form part of the national homeland. Scale is a factor here, however. [[Greater Albania]], even in the largest version, would still be a small country. An irredentist Greater Germany, even if it is limited to contiguous German-speaking regions, would have about 100 million inhabitants. Pan-nationalism is not the same as diaspora nationalism, such as [[Zionism]], which implies the concentration of a dispersed group on an ancestral homeland. [[Colonialism|Colonies]] (other than [[Settler colonialism|settler colonies]]) fall outside most definitions of a nation, since both coloniser and colonised recognise that they share no ethnicity, culture, and language. \n\nNationalist movements in large nations, such as the German and Russian nations, are therefore difficult to distinguish from pan-nationalist movements, and often there are explicitly pan-nationalist elements. Aside from these cases, however, most pan-nationalist movements failed. Specifically pan-national states are rare. [[Yugoslavia]] attempted to unify a category of [[Yugoslav Committee|South Slavs]], the prefix \"jugo\" means \"south\". After 1945, it did recognise separate internal nations, with their own governments.\n\nOther large states are difficult to classify as pan-national. Around 1942 [[Nazi Germany]] controlled a vast collection of annexed territories, German-administered civilian entities, puppet states, collaborationist states, and front-line areas run by the military. The conquests were partly inspired by the idea of [[Lebensraum]], but that is not in itself a pan-nationalist concept. The [[Soviet Union]] had a Soviet identity, but no \"Soviet\" ethnicity, culture, or language. It was influenced by pan-Russian ideas, but also by other geopolitical ideals which implied a large territory. [[China]] has a long tradition of cultural and administrative unity. (The fact that both China and India [[annexation|annexed]] territories does not necessarily make the state pan-national in character.)\n\nThe general failure of the pan-nationalist movements is illustrated by several examples, which had a clear idea of their ideal state, but never got anywhere near achieving it. Modern [[Turkey]] is the former core area of the [[Ottoman Empire]]. The present state is closely modelled on the classic European nation state, and was a deliberate break with that empire. Beside the very strong Turkish nationalism there are three pan-nationalisms. In ascending order of scale: [[pan-Turkism]], a sometimes distinct pan-Turkic ideology referring to the [[Turkic peoples]], and pan-[[Turanism]], which covers most of [[central Asia]] and even Finland and Hungary. As in Turkey, pan-nationalist movements often operate on the margin of a more limited \"standard-nationalist\" movement, in the existing core area of the claimed mega-state.\n\n[[Pan-Slavism]] is another notable example of an influential ideal that never resulted in the corresponding mega-state \u2013 if Russian territory was included, it would extend from the Baltic to the Pacific (west to east) and right down to central Asia and the Caucasus/Black Sea/Mediterranean in the south.\n\n[[Pan-Americanism]] as an ideal was influential around the time of the [[Sim\u00f3n Bol\u00edvar|independence movements]] in [[Latin America]]. However, the new nation-states soon diverged in policy and interests, and no federation emerged. The term acquired another meaning, namely U.S.-led co-operation among the separate nation-states, with a connotation of U.S. [[hegemony]]. That is why there is a pan-Latin-Americanism which proposes inter-Americanism with the [[United States]]. An important exponent of this philosophy is [[V\u00edctor Ra\u00fal Haya de la Torre]], from Peru, while [[Bolivarianism]] represents a current variation on the theme.\n\n[[Pan-Arabism]] favors the unification of the countries of the [[Arab world]], from the [[Atlantic Ocean]] to the [[Arabian Sea]]. Unlike most traditional pan-nationalist movements in Europe, this is not based on race or ethnicity because it has been revitalised with religion at its core.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Major Issues in Islam: The Challenges Within and Without|last=Sindima|first=Harvey|publisher=Hamilton Books|year=2018|isbn=9780761870166|location=Lanham, MD|pages=435}}</ref>\n\n==Recent developments==\nThomas Hegghammer of the [[Norwegian Defence Research Establishment]] has outlined the emergence of \"macro-nationalism\" in the late Cold War era, which kept a low profile until the [[September 11 attacks]].

Final assembly was at EMD's plant at [[La Grange, Illinois|LaGrange]] ([[McCook, Illinois|McCook]]) Illinois. The SW1 was the second generation of {{convert|3402 |cuin|L|abbr=on}} switcher from EMD, succeeding the [[EMC SC|SC]] (cast frame) and [[EMC SW|SW]] (welded frame). The most significant change from those earlier models was the use of an engine of EMD's own design, the then-new [[EMD 567|567]] engine, here in {{convert|600|hp|abbr=on}} [[V6 engine|V6]] form. 661 locomotives of this design were built, no SW1s were built after March 1943 until production started again in September 1945.\n\n==Engine and powertrain==\nThe SW1 introduced a 6-cylinder version of the 567 (later 567A) series engine to EMC/EMD switchers.  Developing {{convert|600|hp|adj=on}} at [[Revolutions per minute|800 rpm]]., this engine remained in production until 1966. Designed specifically for railroad locomotives, this was a supercharged 2 stroke 49 degree C type, with an {{convert|8+1/2|by|10|in|mm|0|abbr=on}}, [[Bore (engine)|bore]] by [[Stroke (engine)|stroke]], giving {{convert|567|cuin|L}} displacement per cylinder. A D.C. generator provides power to three motors, two on each truck, in a B-B arrangement. The SW1, like most EMD switchers, use the [[Association of American Railroads|AAR]] [[AAR type A switcher truck|Type B switcher truck]]. EMC/EMD has built all its own components since 1939.<ref name=pin73>{{cite book|last=Pinkepank|first=Jerry A|title=The Second Diesel Spotter\u2019s Guide|year=1973|publisher=Kalmbach Books|lccn=66-22894|isbn=|pages=10, 26, 35}}</ref><ref name=ros03>{{cite book|editor-first=David|editor-last=Ross|title=The Encyclopedia of Trains and Locomotives|year=2003|publisher=|lccn=|isbn=978-0-7607-9679-5|page=264}}</ref>\n\n== Production changes ==\nLike most long-running locomotive models, a number of changes were made to the SW1 over its production life. Internally, the post-war locomotives were somewhat improved, and used the 567A engine.\n\nOne easily spotted change is the shape of the two center cab windows over the hood, which were curved to follow the roofline originally, but became flat-topped after mid-1950. Another easily seen is the taper of the hood to the cab, which was a two-stage taper in earlier units but became a single taper in later production. Very early locomotives were delivered with a stubby exhaust stack, but this did not lift the diesel exhaust sufficiently clear of crew visibility. All later units were delivered with EMD's standard conical switcher stack, while early units were generally modified with taller stacks too. Early locomotives had a single large headlight, while later had twin sealed-beam headlights.<ref>{{cite book|last=Pinkepank|first=Jerry A|title=The Second Diesel Spotter\u2019s Guide|year=1973|publisher=Kalmbach Books|lccn=66-22894|isbn=|page=35}}</ref>\n\n== Identification ==\nThe SW1 appears very similar to its SC and SW predecessors, but has only a single stack instead of two, a significantly shorter hood and a larger rear platform, no small louvers on the front top hood sides, and a large grille instead of lifting vents on top of the hood front. The sandbox in front of the radiator is somewhat smaller on the SW1.\n\nCompared to later EMD switchers, the SW1 has a much shorter hood, large platforms at each end, a single exhaust stack, and a large 'satchel' type sandbox.\n\n== Original owners ==\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!

Final assembly was at EMD's plant at [[La Grange, Illinois|LaGrange]] ([[McCook, Illinois|McCook]]) Illinois. The SW1 was the second generation of {{convert|3402 |cuin|L|abbr=on}} switcher from EMD, succeeding the [[EMC SC|SC]] (cast frame) and [[EMC SW|SW]] (welded frame). The most significant change from those earlier models was the use of an engine of EMD's own design, the then-new [[EMD 567|567]] engine, here in {{convert|600|hp|abbr=on}} [[V6 engine|V6]] form. 661 locomotives of this design were built, no SW1s were built after March 1943 until production started again in September 1945.\n\n==Engine and powertrain==\nThe SW1 introduced a 6-cylinder version of the 567 (later 567A) series engine to EMC/EMD switchers.  Developing {{convert|600|hp|adj=on}} at [[Revolutions per minute|800 rpm]]., this engine remained in production until 1966. Designed specifically for railroad locomotives, this was a supercharged 2 stroke 45 degree V type, with an {{convert|8+1/2|by|10|in|mm|0|abbr=on}}, [[Bore (engine)|bore]] by [[Stroke (engine)|stroke]], giving {{convert|567|cuin|L}} displacement per cylinder. A D.C. generator provides power to four motors, two on each truck, in a B-B arrangement. The SW1, like most EMD switchers, use the [[Association of American Railroads|AAR]] [[AAR type A switcher truck|Type A switcher truck]]. EMC/EMD has built all its own components since 1939.<ref name=pin73>{{cite book|last=Pinkepank|first=Jerry A|title=The Second Diesel Spotter\u2019s Guide|year=1973|publisher=Kalmbach Books|lccn=66-22894|isbn=|pages=10, 26, 35}}</ref><ref name=ros03>{{cite book|editor-first=David|editor-last=Ross|title=The Encyclopedia of Trains and Locomotives|year=2003|publisher=|lccn=|isbn=978-0-7607-9679-5|page=264}}</ref>\n\n== Production changes ==\nLike most long-running locomotive models, a number of changes were made to the SW1 over its production life. Internally, the post-war locomotives were somewhat improved, and used the 567A engine.\n\nOne easily spotted change is the shape of the two center cab windows over the hood, which were curved to follow the roofline originally, but became flat-topped after mid-1950. Another easily seen is the taper of the hood to the cab, which was a two-stage taper in earlier units but became a single taper in later production. Very early locomotives were delivered with a stubby exhaust stack, but this did not lift the diesel exhaust sufficiently clear of crew visibility. All later units were delivered with EMD's standard conical switcher stack, while early units were generally modified with taller stacks too. Early locomotives had a single large headlight, while later had twin sealed-beam headlights.<ref>{{cite book|last=Pinkepank|first=Jerry A|title=The Second Diesel Spotter\u2019s Guide|year=1973|publisher=Kalmbach Books|lccn=66-22894|isbn=|page=35}}</ref>\n\n== Identification ==\nThe SW1 appears very similar to its SC and SW predecessors, but has only a single stack instead of two, a significantly shorter hood and a larger rear platform, no small louvers on the front top hood sides, and a large grille instead of lifting vents on top of the hood front. The sandbox in front of the radiator is somewhat smaller on the SW1.\n\nCompared to later EMD switchers, the SW1 has a much shorter hood, large platforms at each end, a single exhaust stack, and a large 'satchel' type sandbox.\n\n== Original owners ==\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!
