He is god of justice therefore known as '''Dharmaraja'''. Upon their death, Chitragupta has the task of deciding [[Svarga|heaven]] or the [[Naraka (Hinduism)|hell]] for the humans, depending on their actions on the earth. Chitragupta Maharaj is the seventeenth [[Manasputra]] of Lord [[Brahma]]. Chitragupta is believed to be created from Lord Bramha's soul & mind(chitt) and thus, alloted the right to write [[Vedas]] like [[Brahmins]] with the duty of a [[Kshatriya]] (''Chitragupta  is the patron deity of [[Kayastha]]s, a Hindu caste of India and Nepal).{{cn|date=April 2020}}\n\nLord Brahma had many various sons and daughters in various  structures, including many seers born of his mind, such as Vashishta, Narada, and Atri, and many sons born of his body, such as Dharma, Delusion, Lust, Death, and Bharata. The story of the birth of Chitragupta is related in different ways, but he is nearly always delineated differently from the other children of Lord Brahma, and a common thread is that many Rishi's are born directly of Lord Brahma\u2019s body.\n\nIn one popular version of the creation myth of Chitragupta, it is said that Lord Brahma gave the land of the dead over to the god Yama, also known as Yamraj. Yama would become confused sometimes when dead souls would come to him, and would occasionally send the wrong souls to either heaven or hell. Lord Brahma commanded him to keep better track of everyone, and Yama declared that he could not reasonably be expected to keep track of the many people born of the eighty-four hundred thousand different life forms of planet Earth.\n\nLord Brahma, determined to solve this problem for Yama, sat in meditation for many thousands of years. Finally he opened his eyes, and a man stood before him with a sword, pen and paper. As Chitragupta was born of Brahma's body or kaya in Sanskrit, Brahma declared that his children would forever be known as Kayasthas. \nChitragupta is sometimes also referred to as the first man to use letters, and is hailed that way in the Garud Puran. He is known as being incredibly meticulous, and with his pen and paper he tracks every action of every sentient life form, building up a record of them over the course of their life so that when they die the fate of their soul can be easily determined. These perfect and complete documents are referred to in mystical traditions as the Akashic records, and as they contain the actions of each person from birth to death, they can be said to contain every action taken in the universe.\n\nItems associated with Chitragupta in his puja include the Sword, paper and pen, ink, honey, betel nut, matches, mustard, ginger, jaggery, sugar, sandalwood, and frankincense. A puja is often performed to Chitragupta in reverence of the four virtues he is seen to embody: justice, peace, literacy, and knowledge. Part of the Chitragupta puja also includes writing down how much money you make in your household, and how much you need to make to survive in the following year, while making offerings of turmeric, flowers, and vermilion\n\n==Family==\n\nFirst Wife: Nandini Aravati, Grand daughter of Sun God and daughter of [[Shraddhadeva Manu]].\nSons from her:\n# Dhramdhwaja, he founded [[Srivastava]] [[Kayastha]]\n# Dhramyuj, he founded Gaur [[Kayastha]]\n# Samdayalu, he founded [[Saxena]] [[Kayastha]]\n# Yugandhar, he founded [[Mathur (subcaste)|Mathur]] [[Kayastha]]\n\nSecond wife: Shobhvati, daughter of [[Yamaraj]]. \n# Sumti, he founded [[Karan Kayastha]]\n# Damodar, he founded [[Nigam]] [[Kayastha]]\n# Bhanuprakash, he founded [[Bhatnagar]] [[Kayastha]]\n# Himvaan, he founded [[Ambashtha]]  [[Kayastha]]\n# Dindayalu, he founded [[Asthana]] [[Kayastha]]\n# Sadanand, he founded [[Kulshreshtha]] [[Kayastha]]\n# Raghavram, he founded [[Valmiki]] [[Kayastha]]\n# Vibhanu, he founded Suryadhwaj [[Kayastha]]\nAll Kayastha are descendants of Brahma and hence considered as equal to brahmins but, Lord Brahma ordained the role of upholding dharna followed by Lord Chitragupta and his descendants to dispense knowledge of justice.\n\nBrahmin varna man is allowed to marry woman of Kshatriya varna according to Anuloma Marriage law of Hindus.

The souls of men after death go to Yamapuri, which is presided over by the deities called Yamas who keep records of men's actions and accordingly give them their dues. The principal Yama is called Yamaraja or Dharamaraja, that is, the ruler of Yamapuri or the king of laws.\n\n[[File:Hindu hell.jpg|thumb|A large central panel portrays [[Yama]] the god of death (often referred to as Dharma) seated on a throne; to the left stands a demon.

Lord Brahma went into meditation. Chitragupta sprang from his body and stood before him bearing an inkpot and a pen. The god Brahma (creator) said: \"Because you are sprung from my body (kaya), therefore you shall be called Kayastha and as you existed in my body unseen I give you the name of Chitragupta. Let the Kshatriya dharma be followed by you and your progeny.\" He then assumed charge of Yamapuri. Dharmaraja married his daughter Irawati to Chitragupta and [[Sraddhadeva Manu]](Manu), son of Surya (the Sun) married his daughter Sudakhina(some people say dakshina or nandini) to him.\" Chitragupta had eight sons from the former and four from the latter and these twelve sons became the progenitors of the twelve subdivisions of the Chitraguptavansi Kayasthas, namely Saxena, Mathur, Gaur, Nigam, Ashthana, Kulshrestha, Suryadwaja, Bhatnagar, Ambastha, Shrivastava, Karna and Vaalmik.\n*'''[[Padma Purana]]''' after stating the legend says: \"Chitragupta was placed near Dharamaraj to register the good and evil actions of all sentient beings, that he was possessed of supernatural wisdom and became the partaker of sacrifices offered to the gods and fire. It is for this reason that the twice-born always give him oblations from their food. As he sprang from the body of Lord Brahma he was called Kayastha of numerous gotras on the face of the earth.\"\n*'''[[Bhavishya Purana]]''' states that God, the Creator, gave the name and duties of Chitragupta as follows: Because you have sprung from my body, therefore, you shall be called Kayastha and shall be famous in the world by the name of Chitragupta. Oh my son, let your residence be always in the region of the God of justice for the purpose of determining the merits and demerits of men.\n*'''Vignana Tantra''' says the same thing.\n*The same is the enjoinment of Lord Brahma to Chitragupta according to '''Brihat Brahma Khanda'''. He was named Kayastha having sprung from the body (kaya) of Lord Brahma. He was directed to perform all sanskars and to have writing as his profession.\n*'''[[Garuda Purana]]''' describes the imperial throne of Chitragupta in Yamapuri holding his Court and dispensing justice according to the deeds of men and maintaining their record, in the following words: (There Dharmaraja, Chitragupta, Sravana and others see all sins and virtues remaining concealed in the bodies of men).\n*'''[[The Mahabharata]] (Anusasan Parva, chapter 130)''' recites the teaching of Chitragupta requiring men to do virtuous and charitable acts and performing Yagya, saying that men are rewarded or punished according to their good or bad deeds.\n\n==Legends==\nChitragupta came into being after Brahma, the creator, having established the four varnas \u2014 [[Brahmin]](The Learned), [[Kshatriya]](The Warriors), [[Vaishya]](Merchant) and [[Shudra]](Labourer or Farmer) \u2014 ordained Dharamraj (also called Yamraj, the god of death) to keep record of the deeds \u2014 good and evil \u2014 of all life-forms born and yet to be born on earth, in the heavens above and in the lands below. Dharamraj, however, complained, \"O Lord, how can I alone keep record of the deeds of the beings born into 84 lakh yonis <!-- Female genitalia, divine passage, womb or sacred temple ?? This was introduced 11:04, 3 April 2006 by 210.18.119.115 --> (life-forms) in the three worlds\"\n\nLord Brahma went into meditation for 11, 000 years and when he opened his eyes he saw a man holding pen and ink-pot in his hands and a sword girdled to his waist. Brahma spoke: ''\"Thou hast been created from my body (Kaya), therefore shall thy progeny be known as the Kayasthas. Thou hast been conceived in my mind (Chitta or Chitra) and in secrecy (gupta), thy name shall also be Chitragupta.

He is god of justice therefore known as '''Dharmaraja'''. Upon their death, Chitragupta has the task of deciding [[Svarga|heaven]] or the [[Naraka (Hinduism)|hell]] for the humans, depending on their actions on the earth. Chitragupta Maharaj is the seventeenth [[Manasputra]] of Lord [[Brahma]]. Chitragupta is believed to be created from Lord Bramha's soul & mind(chitt) and thus, alloted the right to write [[Vedas]] like [[ Brahmins]] with the duty of \na [[Kshatriya]] (''Chitragupta  is the patron deity of [[Kayastha]]s, a Hindu caste of India and Nepal).{{cn|date=April 2020}}\n\nLord Brahma had many various sons and daughters in various  structures, including many seers born of his mind, such as Vashishta, Narada, and Atri, and many sons born of his body, such as Dharma, Delusion, Lust, Death, and Bharata. The story of the birth of Chitragupta is related in different ways, but he is nearly always delineated differently from the other children of Lord Brahma, and a common thread is that many Rishi's are born directly of Lord Brahma\u2019s body.\n\nIn one popular version of the creation myth of Chitragupta, it is said that Lord Brahma gave the land of the dead over to the god Yama, also known as Yamraj. Yama would become confused sometimes when dead souls would come to him, and would occasionally send the wrong souls to either heaven or hell. Lord Brahma commanded him to keep better track of everyone, and Yama declared that he could not reasonably be expected to keep track of the many people born of the eighty-four hundred thousand different life forms of planet Earth.\n\nLord Brahma, determined to solve this problem for Yama, sat in meditation for many thousands of years. Finally he opened his eyes, and a man stood before him with a sword, pen and paper. As Chitragupta was born of Brahma's body or kaya in Sanskrit, Brahma declared that his children would forever be known as Kayasthas. \nChitragupta is sometimes also referred to as the first man to use letters, and is hailed that way in the Garud Puran. He is known as being incredibly meticulous, and with his pen and paper he tracks every action of every sentient life form, building up a record of them over the course of their life so that when they die the fate of their soul can be easily determined. These perfect and complete documents are referred to in mystical traditions as the Akashic records, and as they contain the actions of each person from birth to death, they can be said to contain every action taken in the universe.\n\nItems associated with Chitragupta in his puja include the Sword, paper and pen, ink, honey, betel nut, matches, mustard, ginger, jaggery, sugar, sandalwood, and frankincense. A puja is often performed to Chitragupta in reverence of the four virtues he is seen to embody: justice, peace, literacy, and knowledge. Part of the Chitragupta puja also includes writing down how much money you make in your household, and how much you need to make to survive in the following year, while making offerings of turmeric, flowers, and vermilion\n\n==Family==\n\nFirst Wife: Nandini Aravati, Grand daughter of Sun God and daughter of [[Shraddhadeva Manu]].\nSons from her:\n# Dhramdhwaja, he founded [[Srivastava]] [[Kayastha]]\n# Dhramyuj, he founded Gaur [[Kayastha]]\n# Samdayalu, he founded [[Saxena]] [[Kayastha]]\n# Yugandhar, he founded [[Mathur (subcaste)|Mathur]] [[Kayastha]]\n\nSecond wife: Shobhvati, daughter of [[Yamaraj]]. \n# Sumti, he founded [[Karan Kayastha]]\n# Damodar, he founded [[Nigam]] [[Kayastha]]\n# Bhanuprakash, he founded [[Bhatnagar]] [[Kayastha]]\n# Himvaan, he founded [[Ambashtha]]  [[Kayastha]]\n# Dindayalu, he founded [[Asthana]] [[Kayastha]]\n# Sadanand, he founded [[Kulshreshtha]] [[Kayastha]]\n# Raghavram, he founded [[Valmiki]] [[Kayastha]]\n# Vibhanu, he founded Suryadhwaj [[Kayastha]]\nAll Kayastha are descendants of Brahma and hence considered as equal to brahmins but, Lord Brahma ordained the role of upholding dharna followed by Lord Chitragupta and his descendants to dispense knowledge of justice.\n\nBrahmin varna man is allowed to marry woman of Kshatriya varna according to Anuloma Marriage law of Hindus.

The souls of men after death go to Yamapuri, which is presided over by the deities called Yamas who keep records of men's actions and accordingly give them their dues. The principal Yama is called Yamaraja or Dharamaraja, that is, the ruler of Yamapuri or the king of laws.\n\n[[File:Hindu hell.jpg|thumb|A large central panel portrays [[Yama]] the god of death (often referred to as Dharma) seated on a throne; to the left stands a demon.

Lord Brahma went into meditation. Chitragupta sprang from his body and stood before him bearing an inkpot and a pen. The god Brahma (creator) said: \"Because you are sprung from my body (kaya), therefore you shall be called Kayastha and as you existed in my body unseen I give you the name of Chitragupta. Let the Kshatriya dharma be followed by you and your progeny.\" He then assumed charge of Yamapuri. Dharmaraja married his daughter Irawati to Chitragupta and [[Sraddhadeva Manu]](Manu), son of Surya (the Sun) married his daughter Sudakhina(some people say dakshina or nandini) to him.\" Chitragupta had eight sons from the former and four from the latter and these twelve sons became the progenitors of the twelve subdivisions of the Chitraguptavansi Kayasthas, namely Saxena, Mathur, Gaur, Nigam, Ashthana, Kulshrestha, Suryadwaja, Bhatnagar, Ambastha, Shrivastava, Karna and Vaalmik.\n*'''[[Padma Purana]]''' after stating the legend says: \"Chitragupta was placed near Dharamaraj to register the good and evil actions of all sentient beings, that he was possessed of supernatural wisdom and became the partaker of sacrifices offered to the gods and fire. It is for this reason that the twice-born always give him oblations from their food. As he sprang from the body of Lord Brahma he was called Kayastha of numerous gotras on the face of the earth.\"\n*'''[[Bhavishya Purana]]''' states that God, the Creator, gave the name and duties of Chitragupta as follows: Because you have sprung from my body, therefore, you shall be called Kayastha and shall be famous in the world by the name of Chitragupta. Oh my son, let your residence be always in the region of the God of justice for the purpose of determining the merits and demerits of men.\n*'''Vignana Tantra''' says the same thing.\n*The same is the enjoinment of Lord Brahma to Chitragupta according to '''Brihat Brahma Khanda'''. He was named Kayastha having sprung from the body (kaya) of Lord Brahma. He was directed to perform all sanskars and to have writing as his profession.\n*'''[[Garuda Purana]]''' describes the imperial throne of Chitragupta in Yamapuri holding his Court and dispensing justice according to the deeds of men and maintaining their record, in the following words: (There Dharmaraja, Chitragupta, Sravana and others see all sins and virtues remaining concealed in the bodies of men).\n*'''[[The Mahabharata]] (Anusasan Parva, chapter 130)''' recites the teaching of Chitragupta requiring men to do virtuous and charitable acts and performing Yagya, saying that men are rewarded or punished according to their good or bad deeds.\n\n==Legends==\nChitragupta came into being after Brahma, the creator, having established the four varnas \u2014 [[Brahmin]](The Learned), [[Kshatriya]](The Warriors), [[Vaishya]](Merchant) and [[Shudra]](Labourer or Farmer) \u2014 ordained Dharamraj (also called Yamraj, the god of death) to keep record of the deeds \u2014 good and evil \u2014 of all life-forms born and yet to be born on earth, in the heavens above and in the lands below. Dharamraj, however, complained, \"O Lord, how can I alone keep record of the deeds of the beings born into 84 lakh yonis <!-- Female genitalia, divine passage, womb or sacred temple ?? This was introduced 11:04, 3 April 2006 by 210.18.119.115 --> (life-forms) in the three worlds\"\n\nLord Brahma went into meditation for 11, 000 years and when he opened his eyes he saw a man holding pen and ink-pot in his hands and a sword girdled to his waist. Brahma spoke: ''\"Thou hast been created from my body (Kaya), therefore shall thy progeny be known as the Kayasthas. Thou hast been conceived in my mind (Chitta or Chitra) and in secrecy (gupta), thy name shall also be Chitragupta. Let the role of a Kshatriya be followed by thee and thy progeny \"'' Brahma then enjoined him to dispense justice and punish those who violated the dharma.\n\nIn the ''Garuda Purana'', Chitragupta is hailed as the first man to give the script.\n\n:::'''''Chitragupta namastubhyam vedaksaradatre'''''\n::: (Obeisance to Chitragupta, the giver of letters)\n\nIn the legends of Chitragupta as well as in the Vedas, he is referred to as the greatest king, while the rest are \"Rajakas,\" or little kings.\n\n\u091a\u093f\u0924\u094d\u0930 \u0907\u0926 \u0930\u093e\u091c\u093e \u0930\u093e\u091c\u0915\u093e \u0907\u0926\u0928\u094d\u092f\u0915\u0947 \u092f\u0915\u0947 \u0938\u0930\u0938\u094d\u0935\u0924\u0940\u092e\u0928\u0941\u0964<br>\n\u092a\u0930\u094d\u091c\u0928\u094d\u092f \u0907\u0935 \u0924\u0924\u0928\u0926 \u0927\u093f \u0935\u0930\u094d\u0937\u094d\u091f\u094d\u092f\u093e \u0938\u0939\u0938\u094d\u0930\u092e\u092f\u0941\u0924\u093e \u0926\u0926\u0924\u0965 RIG VEDA Book 8/ Hymn 21/ Stanza 18\n<ref>{{Cite book|url=\nhttps://books.google.co.in/books?id=fHYnGde4BS4C&pg=PA68&lpg=PA68&dq=chitra+id+raja+rigveda&source=bl&ots=qE_jNycDIZ&sig=ACfU3U32mqIyNlaPHo_IqcXEYhHmyKOaiw&hl=en&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwjYhv-a4-DoAhUTWX0KHYXQDcEQ6AEwAHoECAcQAQ#v=onepage&q=chitra%20id%20raja%20rigveda&f=false}}</ref>\nThe Rig Veda mentions an invocation to be made to Chitragupta before offering sacrifice.
