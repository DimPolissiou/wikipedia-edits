A large proportion of them were built in Bombay, where the Company had established a small shipyard. In 1736 Parsi carpenters were brought in from Surat to work there and, when their European supervisor died, one of the carpenters, Lowji Nuserwanji Wadia, was appointed Master Builder in his place.\n\nWadia oversaw the construction of thirty-five ships, twenty-one of them for the Company. Following his death in 1774, his sons took charge of the shipyard and between them built a further thirty ships over the next sixteen years. The Britannia, a ship of 749 tons launched in 1778, so impressed the Court of Directors when it reached Britain that several new ships were commissioned from Bombay, some of which later passed into the hands of the Royal Navy. In all, between 1736 and 1821, 159 ships of over 100 tons were built at Bombay, including 15 of over 1,000 tons.

A large proportion of them were built in Bombay, where the Company had established a small shipyard. In 1736 Parsi carpenters were brought in from Surat to work there and, when their European supervisor died, one of the carpenters, Lowji Nuserwanji Wadia, was appointed Master Builder in his place.\n\nWadia oversaw the construction of thirty-five ships, twenty-one of them for the Company. Following his death in 1774, his sons took charge of the shipyard and between them built a further thirty ships over the next sixteen years. The Britannia, a ship of 749 tons launched in 1778, so impressed the Court of Directors when it reached Britain that several new ships were commissioned from Bombay, some of which later passed into the hands of the Royal Navy.

The work is no longer extant but several later adaptations still exist \u2014 the ''Kath\u0101sarits\u0101gara'', ''[[Brihatkathamanjari|B\u1e5bhatkathamanjari]]'' and ''[[B\u1e5bhatkath\u0101\u015blokasa\u1e43graha]]''. However, none of these recensions necessarily derives directly from Gunadhya, and each may have intermediate versions. Scholars compare [[Gu\u1e47\u0101\u1e0dhya]] with [[Vyasa]] and [[Valmiki]] even though he did not write the now long-lost ''[[Brihatkatha|B\u1e5bhatkath\u0101]]'' in Sanskrit. Presently available are its two Sanskrit recensions, the ''[[Brihatkathamanjari|B\u1e5bhatkathamanjari]]'' by [[Kshemendra|K\u1e63emendra]] and the ''Kath\u0101sarits\u0101gara'' by Somadeva.\n\n==Author and structure==\n[[File:Brhatkatha stemma.svg|thumb|upright=2.5|Probable relationship between versions of the [[Brihatkatha]]]]\n\nThe author of ''Kathasaritsagara'', or rather its compiler, was [[Somadeva]], the son of R\u0101ma, a \u015aaiva Br\u0101hman of Kashmir. He tells us that his ''magnum opus'' was written (sometime between 1063-81 CE) for the amusement of S\u016bryavat\u012b, wife of King Ananta of Kashmir, at whose court Somadeva was poet. The tragic history of Kashmir at this period - Ananta\u2019s two sons, Kala\u015ba and Har\u1e63a, the worthless degenerate life of the former, the brilliant but ruthless life of the latter, the suicide of Ananta himself, the self-immolation of S\u016bryavat\u012b on his funeral pyre, and the resulting chaos - forms as a dark and grim background for the setting of Somadeva\u2019s tales. The frame story is the narrative of the adventures of Naravahanadatta, son of the legendary king Udayana, his romances with damsels of great beauty and wars with enemies. As many as 350 tales are built around this central story, making it the largest existing collection of Indian tales.\n\nSomadeva declares that his work is a faithful though abridged translation of a much larger collection of stories known as the ''[[Brihatkatha|B\u1e5bhatkath\u0101]]'', or Great Tale written in the lost [[Paisaci]] dialect by [[Gunadhya|Gu\u1e47\u0101\u1e0dhya]]. But the Kashmirian (or \"Northwestern\") ''B\u1e5bhatkath\u0101'' that [[Somadeva]] adapted may be quite different from the Paisaci [[wikt:urtext|ur-text]], as at least 5 apparent descendants of Gu\u1e47\u0101\u1e0dhya's work exist \u2014 all quite different in form and content, the best-known (after the ''Kath\u0101sarits\u0101gara'' itself) probably being the ''[[B\u1e5bhatkath\u0101\u015blokasa\u1e43graha]]'' of [[Budhasvamin]] from [[Nepal]]. Like the ''Panchatantra'', tales from the ''Kath\u0101sarits\u0101gara'' (or its related versions) travelled to many parts of the world.\n\n''Kath\u0101sarits\u0101gara'' consists of 18 ''lambhakas'' (\"books\") of 124 ''taramgas'' (chapters called as \"waves\") and approximately 22,000 [[shloka|\u015bloka]]s (distichs) in addition to prose sections.<ref>Penzer 1924 Vol I, p xxxi.</ref> The \u015bloka consists of 2 half-verses of 16 syllables each. Thus, syllabically, the ''Kath\u0101sarits\u0101gara'' is approximately equal to 66,000 lines of iambic pentameter; by comparison, [[John Milton]]'s ''[[Paradise Lost]]'' weighs in at 10,565 lines. All this pales in comparison to the (presumably legendary) 700,000 \u015blokas of the lost original ''[[Brihatkatha]]''. \n\nSomadeva\u2019s narrative captivates both by its simple and clear, though very elegant, style and diction and by his skill in drawing with a few strokes pictures of types and characters taken from the real every-day life. Hence it is that even in the miraculous and fantastical facts and events that make up the bulk of the main story and of a great deal of the incidental tales the interest of the reader is uninterruptedly kept. His lively and pleasant art of story-telling \u2014 though now and then encumbered with inflatedness or vitiated by far-fetched false wit \u2014 is enhanced also by his native humor and the elegant and pointed sentences strewn about here and there with a good taste.<ref>J. S. Speyer, ''Studies about the Kathasaritsagara'' (Wiesbaden: M. Sandig, 1968)</ref>\n\n==Synopsis==\nThe ''Kath\u0101sarits\u0101gara'' is a large work. Each book comprises a number of stories loosely strung together, by being narrated for the recreation or information of the same individuals, or arising out of their adventures. These are [[Udayana]], king of [[Kosambi]], and his son Naravahanadatta. The marriage of the latter with various damsels of terrestrial or celestial origin, and his elevation to the rank of king of the [[Vidyadhara]]s, a class of heavenly spirits, are the leading topics of most of the books; but they merely constitute the skeleton of the composition, the substance being made up of stories growing out of these circumstances, or springing from one another with an ingenuity of intricacy which is one of the great charms of all such collections.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable floatright\"\n|+ style=\"text-align: center;\" | ''Kath\u0101sarits\u0101gara''\n|-\n!

One of the attendants of the god, Pushpadanta, took the liberty of listening, and he repeated them, under the seal of secrecy, to his wife, Jaya, a sort of lady\u2019s maid to the goddess. Jaya takes an opportunity of intimating to her mistress that she is acquainted with the stories narrated by Siva to the great mortification of Parvati who had flattered herself that they had been communicated to her alone. She accordingly complains to Siva of his having deceived her and he vindicates himself by discovering the truth. Parvati thereupon pronounces an imprecation upon Pushpadanta, condemning him to be born upon the earth as a man; and she sentences his friend Malyavan, who had ventured to intercede for him, to a like destination. Parvati tells the culprits that they shall resume their celestial condition when Pushpadanta, encountering a Yaksha, a follower of [[Kubera]], the god of wealth, doomed for a certain time to walk the earth, as a Pisacha or goblin, shall recollect his own former state, and shall repeat to the Pisacha the stories he overheard from Siva; and when Malyavan, falling in with the Pisacha, shall hear from him again the stories that his friend Pushpadanta had narrated. The recitation of the stories forms also the limit of the Pisacha\u2019s sojourn amongst mortals.\n\nThe two demigods, Pushpadanta and Malyavan, are born as two Brahmans, named [[Vararuchi]] and [[Gunadhya]], and their adventures as mortals constitute the subject of several tales. Some of these possess much local interest: we have in them literary anecdotes relating to celebrated works and authors, as to [[P\u0101\u1e47ini|Panini]] the grammarian; notices of historical persons and events, as of the accession of [[Chandragupta Maurya]]; and traditions of the origin of celebrated places, as of that of [[Pataliputra]]. One of the best-told stories in the whole work occurs here. Upakosha the wife of Vararuchi, becomes during the absence of her husband, the object of the addresses of the king's family priest, the commander of the guards, the prince's tutor, and her husband's banker. She makes assignations with them all: each as he arrives is quickly followed by his successor, and is secreted only to be finally exposed and punished. \n\nMalyavan, or Gunadhya, in consequence of a dispute with a rival Brahman, forgoes the use of the Sanskrit, Prakrit and Desya, or vernacular languages. He afterwards learns the Paisachi language, or that of the goblins, which enables him to receive the narrations as they are told him by the metamorphosed Yaksha or Pisacha. Gunadhya having heard the stories, extending to seven hundred thousand stanzas, wrote them with his blood, for there was no ink in the forest. He then offered the work to [[Satavahana dynasty|Satavahana]], king of [[Pratishthan]], who rejected it with abhorrence, on which the author kindled a fire in the forest, and reading it aloud, to the great edification of spirits and goblins, and birds and beasts, he burned it leaf by leaf as he finished the perusal. The news of this proceeding at last reached the king, and he repented of what he had done, and repaired to Gunadhya to solicit the gift of the work. The sage consented to present the king with the hundred thousand verses that had not yet been consigned to the flames. Satavahana took it to his capital, and having received an explanation of it from two of Gunadhya's disciples, he translated it from the language of the Pisachas. \n\n===Books 2 to 5===\nThe second book (''Kathamukha'') is supposed to commence that part of the original narrative which was not consumed, and records the adventures of [[Udayana]], king of Kosambi, a prince of great celebrity in Sanskrit plays and poems, and his marriage with Vasavadatta, princess of [[Ujjain]]. The major sub-stories include the tales of Sridatta, Devasmita and Lohajangha. The third book (''Lavanaka'') describes his acquisition of a second bride, Padmavati, princess of [[Magadha]] and his subsequent conquests. This book is especially rich in mythological sub-stories like [[Durvasa]] and [[Kunti]], [[Urvashi]] and [[Pururavas]], [[Indra]] and [[Ahalya]], Sunda and Upasunda &c. The fourth book (''Naravahanadattajanana'') narrates the birth of the son of Udayana, by Vasavadatta, Naravahanadatta; at the same time sons are born to the chief ministers of Udayana, and they become the companions and councilors of the young prince. The book contains the famous story of [[Jimutavahana]]. The fifth book (''Caturdarika'') records the adventures of a mortal, Saktivega who became king of the heavenly beings termed Vidyadharas, a class of spirits who reside upon the loftiest peaks of the Himalaya mountains, who possess superhuman longevity and faculties, and the knowledge of what is passing beyond their presence. The story of their king is told to illustrate the manner in which the destiny of Naravahanadatta, who it is foretold will be king of the Vidyadharas, can be fulfilled. \n\n[[File:BK relations.svg|thumb|upright=2.5|Relationships of chief characters in the ''Brihatkatha'' (as evidenced by the derived texts ''Brihatkathashlokasamgraha'', ''Brihatkathamanjari'', and ''Kathasaritsagara'').]]\n\n=== Book 6 ===\nThe main purpose of the sixth book (''Madanamanchuka'') is the marriage of the young prince with the daughter of Kalingasena, a princess sprung from a celestial nymph, and who at first had been enamoured of Udayana, and desirous of becoming his wife. Udayana is well enough disposed to marry her; but as he has two wives already, his chief minister suggests to him that he may be contented. A friend of the princess, a nymph of air, is also opposed to the match, and a variety of tales are recited on either side in support of the reasonings for and against the union. In the end, a spirit of air, in love with the princess, assumes the semblance of Udayana, and in his person weds her. She becomes reconciled to what is without remedy, and has a daughter, Madanamanchuka who is the bride of Udayana's son. The book features the famous story of Usha and [[Aniruddha]].\n\n===Book 7 ===\nIn the next book (''Ratnaprabha'') Naravahanadatta marries a Vidyadhari; the wedding is celebrated at the residence of the lady's father, on one of the snow-crowned summits of the Himalaya. When the married couple return to Kosambi the young bride persuades her husband to throw open the doors of the inner apartments, and allow free ingress to his friends and associates. \u201cThe honour of women,\u201d she affirms, \u201cis protected by their own principles alone; and where these are corrupt, all precautions are vain.\u201d The object of this arrangement is not only, however, the emancipation of the women from jealous restraint, but provision for the carrying on of the series of tales, as the prince's companions are their ordinary narrators. The stories that then ensue (for e.g. Somasvamin, Sringabhuja and Rupasikha) bear hard in general upon the conduct of women; but some are told in their vindication. \n\n=== Books 8 and 9 ===\nThe eighth book (''Suryaprabha'') is devoted to the further illustration of the mode in which the prince may attain the elevation that has been promised him, by the relation of the adventures of a prince named Suryaprabha, who became king of the Vidyadharas. The scene of action is mostly in the regions below or those above the earth, and the ''dramatis personae'' are the [[N\u0101ga|Nagas]] or snake-gods of [[Patala]] and the Vidyadharas of mid-air. In the ninth book (''Alamkaravati'') are narrated a number of stories for the consolation of Naravahanadatta, on the disappearance of his favorite bride Madanamanchuka, their subjects being the temporary separation and final reunion of faithful couples. They wind up with a compendious recital of the adventures of [[Nala]] and [[Damayanti]]. \n\n=== Book 10 ===\nThe next book (''Saktiyasas''), the tenth, is of still greater importance than any of its predecessors in the history of fiction, as it includes the whole of the ''[[Panchatantra]]''. The stories and the order in which they succeed agree better with the tales and arrangement of the ''Kalila wa Demna'' than even the ''Panchatantra'', and it would appear therefore that we have in the ''Kathasaritsagara'' an earlier representative of the original collection than even the Panchatantra, at least as it is now met with. We have in this book also what may be perhaps the original of another well-known story, that of King Shahryar and His Brother in the ''[[One Thousand and One Nights]]''. Two young Brahmins travelling are benighted in a forest, and take up their lodging in a tree near a lake. Early in the night a number of people come from the water, and having made preparation for an entertainment retire; a Yaksha, a genie, then comes out of the lake with his two wives, and spends the night there; when he and one of his wives are asleep, the other, seeing the youths, invites them to approach her, and to encourage them, shows them a hundred rings received from former gallants, notwithstanding her husband's precautions, who keeps her locked up in a chest at the bottom of the lake. The youths reject her advances; she wakes the genie who is going to put them to death, but the rings are produced in evidence against the unfaithful wife, and she is turned away with the loss of her nose.\n\n=== Books 11 to 13 ===\nThe eleventh book (''Vela'') is occupied with one story only, that of Vela, a damsel married to a merchant's son; the leading incidents are their shipwreck, separation and re-union. The twelfth book (''Sasankavati'') narrates the huge tale of Mrigankadatta, prince of Ayodhya. The scheme of this series of narratives is similar to that of the excellent and popular Sanskrit work, ascribed to [[Da\u1e47\u1e0din]], the [[Dashakumaracharita]], the Tale of the Ten Princes, in which a prince and his nine companions are separated for a season, and recount what has happened to each when they meet again. The stories, however, are different. The twelfth book is also important as it contains the plan and details of a collection of tales extremely popular in India, existing both in Sanskrit and in all the vernacular dialects, called the [[Vetala Panchavimshati]]: twenty-five tales of a Vetala being related by a sprite, who haunts cemeteries and animates dead bodies, to Vikramaditya, king of Ujjain, according to the usual version, to Trivikramasena, king of [[Pratishthan]], on the Godavari, according to the ''Kathasaritsagara''. The thirteenth book (''Madiravati'') is short and recounts the adventures of two young Brahmans, who effect secret marriages with a princess and her friend. The incidents are curious and diverting, but they are chiefly remarkable from being the same as the contrivances by which Madhava and Makaranda obtain their mistresses in the drama entitled ''Malatimadhava'' by [[Bhavabhuti]]. \n\n{{multiple image\n| total_width = 440\n| header = Illustrations from an edition of the Kathasaritsagara, c.1590\n| image1 = Tale of the Cunning Siddhikari.jpg\n| width1      = 520\n| height1     = 640\n| caption1 = ''Tale of the Cunning Siddhikari''\n| image2 = Somaprabha and a Celestial Nymph Listening to Music.jpg\n| width2      = 640\n| height2     = 610\n| caption2 = ''Somaprabha and a Celestial Nymph Listening to Music''\n}}\n\n=== Book 14 and 15 ===\nThe two next books, the fourteenth (''Panca'') and fifteenth (''Mahabhisheka''), the scene of action is laid chiefly amongst the fabulous regions of the Vidyadharas. In the first, the prince Naravahanadatta loses his queen Madanamanchuka to his rival Vidyadhara Manasavega, the prince subsequently makes an addition to his domestic arrangements, of five Vidyadhari wives and finally kills Manasavega and regains his queen. In the second, he is crowned emperor of the Vidyadhara race. \n\n=== Book 16 ===\nThe connecting thread of the series of tales should here terminate; but in the next book (''Suratamanjari''), the sixteenth, we have an account of the death of Udayana, who resigns his throne to Gopalaka, the brother of his wife Vasavadatta, and, accompanied by his wives and ministers, goes to Mount Kalanjana, where a heavenly chariot descends, and conveys them all to heaven. Gopalaka, inconsolable for the loss of his brother-in-law, soon relinquishes his regal state, and making over Kosambi to his younger brother, Palaka, repairs to the White Mountain, and spends the rest of his days in the hermitage of [[Kashyapa]]. We have then an account of the son of Palaka falling in love with a young girl of low caste, a Chandali, and different stories illustrative of unequal matches, some of which have been told before. A very convenient doctrine is maintained by Palaka's ministers, that the very circumstance of the prince's being enamoured of the Chandali is a proof that she cannot be truly of so base an origin, but that she must be a princess or goddess in disguise; otherwise it were impossible that she should have attracted the affections of any noble individual. They therefore counsel the king to demand the nymph of her father. The father consents, on condition that the Brahmins of Ujjain eat in his house. Palaka issues orders that the Brahmins, to the number of eighteen thousand, shall dine with the Chandala. They are of course in great alarm, as this is a virtual degradation and loss of caste, and they apply to [[Mahakala]], the form of Siva especially worshipped in Ujjain, to know what to do. He commands them in a dream to comply, as Matanga, the supposed Chandala, is in truth a Vidyadhara. He had conspired against the life of Naravahanadatta, in order to prevent his becoming emperor of the Vidyadharas, and had been therefore condemned by Siva to live in Ujjain with his family as Chandalas. The curse was to terminate when eighteen thousand Brahmins should eat in his house; and this being accomplished, he is restored to his rank, and his daughter is a fit bride for the son of the king. \n\n=== Books 17 and 18 ===\nThe two last books are composed of narratives told by Naravahanadatta, when on a visit to his uncle Gopalaka at the hermitage of Kashyapa. He repeats those stories which were communicated to him when he was separated from Madanamanchuka, to console him under the anguish of separation. The first book (''Padmavati'') treats entirely of the loves of Muktaphalaketu, a prince of the Vidyadharas, and Padmavati, daughter of the king of the Gandharvas. The former is condemned by a holy person to become a man, and he is thus for a season separated from the latter. He is, after a short time, restored to his station and his wife. The last book (''Visamasila'') is of a more diversified description, and has Vikramaditya or Vikramasila, son of Mahendraditya, king of Ujjain, for its hero, and describes his victories over hostile princes, and his acquirement of various princesses. These are interspersed with love adventures, some of which reiterate the calumnies against women, and with stories relating the tricks of professed cheats.\n\n==History: versions and translations==\n=== Sanskrit antecedents: ''B\u1e5bhatkath\u0101ma\u00f1jar\u012b'' and ''B\u1e5bhatkath\u0101\u015blokasa\u1e43graha'' ===\n==== ''B\u1e5bhatkath\u0101ma\u00f1jar\u012b'' ====\n{| class=\"wikitable floatright\"\n|+ style=\"text-align: center;\" | ''B\u1e5bhatkath\u0101ma\u00f1jar\u012b''\n|-\n!

The ''Kath\u0101sarits\u0101gara'' is not the only rendition of the ''B\u1e5bhatkath\u0101'', for twenty or thirty years previously K\u1e63emendra, the great Sanskrit aesthete from Kashmir, had written his ''B\u1e5bhatkath\u0101ma\u00f1jar\u012b'', an epitome of the ''B\u1e5bhatkath\u0101''. The ''Kath\u0101sarits\u0101gara'' and the ''B\u1e5bhatkath\u0101ma\u00f1jar\u012b'' agree in the number and the titles of the different ''lambhakas'' but, after ''lambhaka'' 5, disagree in the order of them, even to a considerable degree. However, all the books of the same name in both versions overlap with each other exactly (excluding a few minor details), except for two. Book 8 (''Vela'') in K\u1e63emendra is a combination of Book 11 (''Vela'') and the beginning of Book 14 (''Panca'') in ''Kath\u0101sarits\u0101gara''. Considering that K\u1e63emendra composed two near faithful extracts of the celebrated epics: the ''Bharatamanjari'' and the ''Ramayanamanjari'', it is more probable that it was K\u1e63emendra, and not Somadeva, who drew up the faithful reproduction of the old Paisaci poem. Compared with Somadeva\u2019s work, the ''B\u1e5bhatkath\u0101ma\u00f1jar\u012b'' pales into insignificance, lacking the charm of language, elegance of style, masterly arrangement and metrical skill of the later production. Moreover, K\u1e63emendra\u2019s collection is only a third the length of the ''Kath\u0101sarits\u0101gara'', the printed text amounting to a little more than 7,561 slokas. \n\nAs early as 1871 Professor B\u00fchler (''Indian Antiquary'', p. 302 et seq.) proved two important facts: firstly, that Somadeva and K\u1e63emendra used the same text, and secondly, that they worked entirely independently from one another. A ''B\u1e5bhatkath\u0101'' such as the two writers reproduced, a prose work in the Pai\u015b\u0101c\u012b dialect, existed, therefore, in Kashmir. But it was no longer the book which Gu\u1e47\u0101\u1e0dhya had composed. It was a huge compilation, incorporating not only many particular stories from heterogeneous sources, but even whole books such as the ''Pa\u00f1catantra'', the ''Vet\u0101lapa\u00f1cavi\u1e43\u015bati'' and the story of [[Nala]]. The charge of abridging, obscuring and dislocating the main narrative is valid, not against Somadeva and K\u1e63emendra, but against predecessors, whose work of amplification had been completed, so far as completion can be predicated, perhaps two or three centuries earlier.<ref>J. S. Speyer, ''Studies about the Kathasaritsagara'' (Wiesbaden: M. Sandig, 1968)</ref> \n\n==== ''B\u1e5bhatkath\u0101\u015blokasa\u1e43graha'' ====\nApart from the Kashmir redactions there exists a Sanskrit version of Gu\u1e47\u0101\u1e0dhya\u2019s work, bearing the title ''B\u1e5bhatkath\u0101\u015blokasa\u1e43graha,'' i.e. the \u201cGreat Tale: Verse Epitome.\u201d In spite of its rather unassuming title, it must in its complete form have been \u2014 for we possess only about six of the twenty-six l\u0101bhas, \u201cemprizes\u201d \u2014 of very considerable extent, say about 25,000 slokas or couplets. Its discoverer and editor, M. F\u00e9lix Lac\u00f4te, had published (''Essai sur Gu\u1e47\u0101\u1e0dhya et la B\u1e5bhatkath\u0101'', Paris, 1908) along with the text an elaborate discussion of all the questions of higher criticism relating to the ''Kath\u0101sarits\u0101gara'' and the other recensions. M. Lac\u00f4te\u2019s conclusions, which are developed with great perspicacity, may be summarised as follows.<ref>Lac\u00f4te, F\u00e9lix, ''Essai s\u00fbr Gu\u1e47\u0101\u1e0dhya et la B\u1e5bhatkath\u0101'' (Paris: Ernest Leroux, 1908)</ref>\n\nThe ''B\u1e5bhatkath\u0101\u015blokasa\u1e43graha'' of which the MS. came from Nepal, is the work of a Nepalese writer, by name Budhasv\u0101min. It is of relatively early date, say the eighth to the ninth century CE and is based upon the Pai\u015b\u0101ci original. In its arrangement, and still more in its contents, it differs widely from the Kashmir versions. The most significant feature of these differences, however, is that they are largely by way of defect. Great masses of the subsidiary tales in the ''Kath\u0101sarits\u0101gara'' are wanting, and thus the main narrative stands out in much greater distinctness and amplitude. It is not that K\u1e63emendra and Somadeva have greatly perverted the story although there are some rather considerable dislocations, which deface its logical coherence. The chief difference is that the story is reduced to a rather slender trickle, which tends to be lost in the deluge of adventitious matter. The Pai\u015b\u0101c\u012b original, though including, like other Indian narratives, a quota of incidental tales and episodes, was concerned predominantly with the actual adventures of Narav\u0101hanadatta, a hero of Gu\u1e47\u0101\u1e0dhya\u2019s own invention. \n\n=== Persian adaptations: ''Bahr al-asmar'' and ''Darya-yi asmar'' ===\n''Kath\u0101sarits\u0101gara'' was translated into Persian in Kashmir during the reign of [[Zain-ul-Abidin|Zayn al-\u2018Abidin]] (r. 1418/20-1470) under the name of ''Bahr al-asmar'' (\u201cOcean of Stories\u201d). Nowadays this version is not extant; it is known solely through the evidence from other sources. A likely reference to it can be found in the ''[[Rajatarangini]]'' by \u015ar\u012bvara (fl. 1459-1505). \u015ar\u012bvara, the poet laureate at the court, refers to the commissioning of the translation of Sanskrit works into Persian and vice versa by his patron Zayn al-\u2018Abidin, among them a translation of \u201ca digest of the ''[[B\u1e5bhatkath\u0101]]''\u201d (''b\u1e5bhatkath\u0101s\u0101ra'') which may refer to the ''Kath\u0101sarits\u0101gara''.<ref>Walter Slaje,\u201cKaschmir im Mittelalter und die Quellen der Geschichtswissenschaft,\u201d ''Indo-Iranian Journal'' 48, 1 (2005): 23.</ref>\n\nAnother Persian version was commissioned in the second half of the 16th century during [[Akbar]]\u2019s reign and accomplished by a certain Mustafa Khaliqdad \u2018Abbasi also known as the translator of other works. This work was presumably carried out after 1590 following the military annexation of Kashmir.<ref>Heike Franke, \u201cAkbar\u2019s Kath\u0101sarits\u0101gara: The Translator and Illustrations of an Imperial Manuscript,\u201d ''Muqarnas'' 27 (2010): 313\u2013356, 321-322.</ref> Abbasi named it ''Darya-yi asmar'' (\u201cRiver of Stories\u201d) to distinguish it from the Kashmirian translation. In its preface, \u02bfAbbasi mentions that he was assigned to rewrite an earlier version \u201cof the book ''barhatkata'' [\u2026] which the Kashmirian Brahmin Sumdevbat [\u2026] had shortened\u201d and which \u201csomeone had undertaken during Zayn al-\u2018Abidin\u2019s reign\u201d, being fraught with Arabic expressions, in a more readable style.\u201d In conformity with the Sanskrit text, the Persian adaptation is likewise divided into eighteen main chapters, called ''nahr'' (rivers), each subdivided into several ''mauj'' (waves).<ref>Khaliqdad \u2018Abbasi, Mustafa, ''Darya-yi asmar tarjuma-yi katasaritsagar'', ed. Tara Chand, Sayyid Amir Hasan \u2018Abidi (New Delhi: Aligarh Muslim University and Markaz-i tahqiqat-i farsi, Rayzan-i farhangi-yi sifarat-i jumhuri-yi islami-yi Iran, 1997).</ref> This translation was discovered around 1968-9 (National Museum, New Delhi no. 62.1005). It was edited by Dr. Tara Chand and Prof. Syed Amir Hasan Abidi. It is worth mentioning that today only two manuscripts of the Persian version are available; both are incomplete and contain only 8 out of the original 18 chapters of the Sanskrit version each, which Chand and \u2018Abidi based their edition upon.<ref>The Manuscripts are stored in the State Central Library of Hyderabad and the India Office Collection, London. See Khaliqdad \u2018Abbasi, ''Darya-yi asmar tarjuma-yi katasaritsagar'', Introduction, 8.</ref> \n\nIn contrast to other examples from similar kind of literature like Abu al-Ma\u02bfali Nasrullah Munshi\u2019s ''Kalila va Dimna'', the ''Darya-yi asmar'' was retold not in artificial prose (''nasr-i musajja\u2018'') aimed at connoisseurs but rather in simple prose with features that remind of an oral recital. In the Persian narrative we encounter a mix of adaptation techniques: some sections display a transfer close to the Indian version, whereas most parts indicate a more narrative approach. This means that special attention was given to the transmission of the narrated story and not to the preservation of as many textual features as possible. One of the adaptation techniques applied in the ''Kath\u0101sarits\u0101gara'' is the use of explanations and glosses to single words that refer to persons, objects or concepts. The translator-compiler \u2018Abb\u0101s\u012b remarks, for example, that \u201cthis story is elaborated upon in [other] Indian books\u201d, or comments on certain passages by adding: \u201c[\u2026] according to the sayings of the people of India [\u2026].\u201d The second type of strategy encountered is that of inserting poetic quotations from the pool of Persian poetry such as ''[[Gulistan (book)|Gulistan]]'', ''[[Hafez|Divan-i Hafiz]]'', ''Divan-i Salman-i Savaji'', ''Manzumat-i Sharaf al-Din Yazdi'', [[Nizami Ganjavi|Nizami]]\u2019s ''Khusrau-u-Shirin'', ''Makhzan al-asrar'', ''Haft paykar'', and various others.<ref>Anna Martin, \u201c\u2018Translator\u2019s Invisibility\u2019: Strategies of Adaptation in Persian Versions of Indian Tales from the Mughal Period,\u201d ''Iran Namag'', Volume 2, Number 2 (Summer 2017), XXIV-XXXVII.</ref>\n\n=== Printed editions and modern translations ===\nProfessor H. H. Wilson was the first European scholar who drew the attention of the Western world to this storehouse of fables. In 1824, he gave a summary of the first five books in the ''Oriental Quarterly Magazine''. The first edition of the work was undertaken by Professor Brockhaus. In 1839 he issued the first five chapters only, and it was not till 1862 that the remaining thirteen appeared. Both publications formed part of the ''Abhandlungen der Deutschen Morgenl\u00e4ndischen Gesellschaft''.\n\nIt was this text which C. H. Tawney used for his excellent translation (''Ocean of the River of Streams'') published by the Asiatic Society of Bengal in the ''Bibliotheca Indica'', 1880-1884 (the index not appearing till 1887). Brockhaus\u2019 edition was based primarily on six MSS., though in the second part of the work he apparently had not so many at his disposal. Tawney was not satisfied with several of Brockhaus\u2019 readings, and consequently made numerous fresh renderings or suggestions largely taken from MSS. borrowed from the Calcutta College and from three India Office MSS. lent him by Dr Rost.\n\nIn 1889 Durg\u0101pras\u0101d issued the Bombay edition, printed at the Nir\u1e47ayas\u0101gara Press, which was produced from Brockhaus\u2019 edition and two Bombay MSS. This is the latest text now available.\n\nIn 1919, N. M. Penzer first approached Tawney with the suggestion of reissuing his ''Ocean of the River of Streams''. But he revised and published Tawney\u2019s 2 volumes in 10 volumes in 1924. The first volume gave an introduction of Hindu fiction and the other famous story-collections like ''Panchatantra'', ''Hitopadesha'' etc. Volumes 2 to 10 published the original translation with extensive comments. Penzer invited different scholars to write forewords to each volume resulting in nine excellent essays dealing with all aspects of the great collection.\n\nA project to translate the full work into modern English prose, translated by Sir James Mallinson, began to appear in 2007 from the Clay Sanskrit Library, published by New York University Press. The translation was based on the Nirnaya Press\u2019s 1915 edition of the Sanskrit text, the edition favored by Sanskritists today. Currently available are 2 volumes of the projected 7-volume edition.\n\n==== Printed editions ====\n\n* {{citation | year=1889 | title = The Kath\u00e2sarits\u00e2gara of Somadevabhatta | editor1=Pandit Durg\u0101pras\u0101da | editor2=K\u0101\u015b\u012bn\u0101tha P\u0101\u1e47\u1e0dura\u1e45ga Paraba | publisher=The Nirnaya-S\u00e2gara Press | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=OKlDAAAAYAAJ}}\n* {{citation | year=1915 | title = The Kath\u00e2sarits\u00e2gara of Somadevabhatta | editor1=Pandit Durg\u0101pras\u0101da | editor2=K\u0101\u015b\u012bn\u0101tha P\u0101\u1e47\u1e0dura\u1e45ga Paraba | publisher=The Nirnaya-S\u00e2gara Press | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=OKlDAAAAYAAJ|last=|first=|volume=|pages=|edition=3rd|editor3-last=Wasudev Laxman Shastri Pansikar}}\n\n==== Translations ====\n\n*[[Charles Henry Tawney|C.

The work is no longer extant but several later adaptations still exist \u2014 the ''Kath\u0101sarits\u0101gara'', ''[[Brihatkathamanjari|B\u1e5bhatkathamanjari]]'' and ''[[B\u1e5bhatkath\u0101\u015blokasa\u1e43graha]]''. However, none of these recensions necessarily derives directly from Gunadhya, and each may have intermediate versions. Scholars compare [[Gu\u1e47\u0101\u1e0dhya]] with [[Vyasa]] and [[Valmiki]] even though he did not write the now long-lost ''[[Brihatkatha|B\u1e5bhatkath\u0101]]'' in Sanskrit. Presently available are its two Sanskrit recensions, the ''[[Brihatkathamanjari|B\u1e5bhatkathamanjari]]'' by [[Kshemendra|K\u1e63emendra]] and the ''Kath\u0101sarits\u0101gara'' by Somadeva.\n\n==Author and structure==\n[[File:Brhatkatha stemma.svg|thumb|upright=2.5|Probable relationship between versions of the [[Brihatkatha]]]]\n\nThe author of ''Kathasaritsagara'', or rather its compiler, was [[Somadeva]], the son of R\u0101ma, a \u015aaiva Br\u0101hman of Kashmir. He tells us that his ''magnum opus'' was written (sometime between 1063-81 CE) for the amusement of S\u016bryavat\u012b, wife of King Ananta of Kashmir, at whose court Somadeva was poet. The tragic history of Kashmir at this period - Ananta\u2019s two sons, Kala\u015ba and Har\u1e63a, the worthless degenerate life of the former, the brilliant but ruthless life of the latter, the suicide of Ananta himself, the self-immolation of S\u016bryavat\u012b on his funeral pyre, and the resulting chaos - forms as a dark and grim background for the setting of Somadeva\u2019s tales. The frame story is the narrative of the adventures of Naravahanadatta, son of the legendary king Udayana, his romances with damsels of great beauty and wars with enemies. As many as 350 tales are built around this central story, making it the largest existing collection of Indian tales.\n\nSomadeva declares that his work is a faithful though abridged translation of a much larger collection of stories known as the ''[[Brihatkatha|B\u1e5bhatkath\u0101]]'', or Great Tale written in the lost [[Paisaci]] dialect by [[Gunadhya|Gu\u1e47\u0101\u1e0dhya]]. But the Kashmirian (or \"Northwestern\") ''B\u1e5bhatkath\u0101'' that [[Somadeva]] adapted may be quite different from the Paisaci [[wikt:urtext|ur-text]], as at least 5 apparent descendants of Gu\u1e47\u0101\u1e0dhya's work exist \u2014 all quite different in form and content, the best-known (after the ''Kath\u0101sarits\u0101gara'' itself) probably being the ''[[B\u1e5bhatkath\u0101\u015blokasa\u1e43graha]]'' of [[Budhasvamin]] from [[Nepal]]. Like the ''Panchatantra'', tales from the ''Kath\u0101sarits\u0101gara'' (or its related versions) travelled to many parts of the world.\n\n''Kath\u0101sarits\u0101gara'' consists of 18 ''lambhakas'' (\"books\") of 124 ''taramgas'' (chapters called as \"waves\") and approximately 22,000 [[shloka|\u015bloka]]s (distichs) in addition to prose sections.<ref>Penzer 1924 Vol I, p xxxi.</ref> The \u015bloka consists of 2 half-verses of 16 syllables each. Thus, syllabically, the ''Kath\u0101sarits\u0101gara'' is approximately equal to 66,000 lines of iambic pentameter; by comparison, [[John Milton]]'s ''[[Paradise Lost]]'' weighs in at 10,565 lines. All this pales in comparison to the (presumably legendary) 700,000 \u015blokas of the lost original ''[[Brihatkatha]]''. \n\nSomadeva\u2019s narrative captivates both by its simple and clear, though very elegant, style and diction and by his skill in drawing with a few strokes pictures of types and characters taken from the real every-day life. Hence it is that even in the miraculous and fantastical facts and events that make up the bulk of the main story and of a great deal of the incidental tales the interest of the reader is uninterruptedly kept. His lively and pleasant art of story-telling \u2014 though now and then encumbered with inflatedness or vitiated by far-fetched false wit \u2014 is enhanced also by his native humor and the elegant and pointed sentences strewn about here and there with a good taste.<ref>J. S. Speyer, ''Studies about the Kathasaritsagara'' (Wiesbaden: M. Sandig, 1968)</ref>\n\n==Synopsis==\nThe ''Kath\u0101sarits\u0101gara'' is a large work. Each book comprises a number of stories loosely strung together, by being narrated for the recreation or information of the same individuals, or arising out of their adventures. These are [[Udayana]], king of [[Kosambi]], and his son Naravahanadatta. The marriage of the latter with various damsels of terrestrial or celestial origin, and his elevation to the rank of king of the [[Vidyadhara]]s, a class of heavenly spirits, are the leading topics of most of the books; but they merely constitute the skeleton of the composition, the substance being made up of stories growing out of these circumstances, or springing from one another with an ingenuity of intricacy which is one of the great charms of all such collections.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable floatright\"\n|+ style=\"text-align: center;\" | ''Kath\u0101sarits\u0101gara''\n|-\n!

One of the attendants of the god, Pushpadanta, took the liberty of listening, and he repeated them, under the seal of secrecy, to his wife, Jaya, a sort of lady\u2019s maid to the goddess. Jaya takes an opportunity of intimating to her mistress that she is acquainted with the stories narrated by Siva to the great mortification of Parvati who had flattered herself that they had been communicated to her alone. She accordingly complains to Siva of his having deceived her and he vindicates himself by discovering the truth. Parvati thereupon pronounces an imprecation upon Pushpadanta, condemning him to be born upon the earth as a man; and she sentences his friend Malyavan, who had ventured to intercede for him, to a like destination. Parvati tells the culprits that they shall resume their celestial condition when Pushpadanta, encountering a Yaksha, a follower of [[Kubera]], the god of wealth, doomed for a certain time to walk the earth, as a Pisacha or goblin, shall recollect his own former state, and shall repeat to the Pisacha the stories he overheard from Siva; and when Malyavan, falling in with the Pisacha, shall hear from him again the stories that his friend Pushpadanta had narrated. The recitation of the stories forms also the limit of the Pisacha\u2019s sojourn amongst mortals.\n\nThe two demigods, Pushpadanta and Malyavan, are born as two Brahmans, named [[Vararuchi]] and [[Gunadhya]], and their adventures as mortals constitute the subject of several tales. Some of these possess much local interest: we have in them literary anecdotes relating to celebrated works and authors, as to [[Panini]] the grammarian; notices of historical persons and events, as of the accession of [[Chandragupta Maurya]]; and traditions of the origin of celebrated places, as of that of [[Pataliputra]]. One of the best-told stories in the whole work occurs here. Upakosha the wife of Vararuchi, becomes during the absence of her husband, the object of the addresses of the king's family priest, the commander of the guards, the prince's tutor, and her husband's banker. She makes assignations with them all: each as he arrives is quickly followed by his successor, and is secreted only to be finally exposed and punished. \n\nMalyavan, or Gunadhya, in consequence of a dispute with a rival Brahman, forgoes the use of the Sanskrit, Prakrit and Desya, or vernacular languages. He afterwards learns the Paisachi language, or that of the goblins, which enables him to receive the narrations as they are told him by the metamorphosed Yaksha or Pisacha. Gunadhya having heard the stories, extending to seven hundred thousand stanzas, wrote them with his blood, for there was no ink in the forest. He then offered the work to [[Satavahana dynasty|Satavahana]], king of [[Pratishthan]], who rejected it with abhorrence, on which the author kindled a fire in the forest, and reading it aloud, to the great edification of spirits and goblins, and birds and beasts, he burned it leaf by leaf as he finished the perusal. The news of this proceeding at last reached the king, and he repented of what he had done, and repaired to Gunadhya to solicit the gift of the work. The sage consented to present the king with the hundred thousand verses that had not yet been consigned to the flames. Satavahana took it to his capital, and having received an explanation of it from two of Gunadhya's disciples, he translated it from the language of the Pisachas. \n\n===Books 2 to 5===\nThe second book (''Kathamukha'') is supposed to commence that part of the original narrative which was not consumed, and records the adventures of [[Udayana]], king of Kosambi, a prince of great celebrity in Sanskrit plays and poems, and his marriage with Vasavadatta, princess of [[Ujjain]]. The major sub-stories include the tales of Sridatta, Devasmita and Lohajangha. The third book (''Lavanaka'') describes his acquisition of a second bride, Padmavati, princess of [[Magadha]] and his subsequent conquests. This book is especially rich in mythological sub-stories like [[Durvasa]] and [[Kunti]], [[Urvashi]] and [[Pururavas]], [[Indra]] and [[Ahalya]], Sunda and Upasunda &c. The fourth book (''Naravahanadattajanana'') narrates the birth of the son of Udayana, by Vasavadatta, Naravahanadatta; at the same time sons are born to the chief ministers of Udayana, and they become the companions and councilors of the young prince. The book contains the famous story of [[Jimutavahana]]. The fifth book (''Caturdarika'') records the adventures of a mortal, Saktivega who became king of the heavenly beings termed Vidyadharas, a class of spirits who reside upon the loftiest peaks of the Himalaya mountains, who possess superhuman longevity and faculties, and the knowledge of what is passing beyond their presence. The story of their king is told to illustrate the manner in which the destiny of Naravahanadatta, who it is foretold will be king of the Vidyadharas, can be fulfilled. \n\n[[File:BK relations.svg|thumb|upright=2.5|Relationships of chief characters in the ''Brihatkatha'' (as evidenced by the derived texts ''Brihatkathashlokasamgraha'', ''Brihatkathamanjari'', and ''Kathasaritsagara'').]]\n\n=== Book 6 ===\nThe main purpose of the sixth book (''Madanamanchuka'') is the marriage of the young prince with the daughter of Kalingasena, a princess sprung from a celestial nymph, and who at first had been enamoured of Udayana, and desirous of becoming his wife. Udayana is well enough disposed to marry her; but as he has two wives already, his chief minister suggests to him that he may be contented. A friend of the princess, a nymph of air, is also opposed to the match, and a variety of tales are recited on either side in support of the reasonings for and against the union. In the end, a spirit of air, in love with the princess, assumes the semblance of Udayana, and in his person weds her. She becomes reconciled to what is without remedy, and has a daughter, Madanamanchuka who is the bride of Udayana's son. The book features the famous story of Usha and [[Aniruddha]].\n\n===Book 7 ===\nIn the next book (''Ratnaprabha'') Naravahanadatta marries a Vidyadhari; the wedding is celebrated at the residence of the lady's father, on one of the snow-crowned summits of the Himalaya. When the married couple return to Kosambi the young bride persuades her husband to throw open the doors of the inner apartments, and allow free ingress to his friends and associates. \u201cThe honour of women,\u201d she affirms, \u201cis protected by their own principles alone; and where these are corrupt, all precautions are vain.\u201d The object of this arrangement is not only, however, the emancipation of the women from jealous restraint, but provision for the carrying on of the series of tales, as the prince's companions are their ordinary narrators. The stories that then ensue (for e.g. Somasvamin, Sringabhuja and Rupasikha) bear hard in general upon the conduct of women; but some are told in their vindication. \n\n=== Books 8 and 9 ===\nThe eighth book (''Suryaprabha'') is devoted to the further illustration of the mode in which the prince may attain the elevation that has been promised him, by the relation of the adventures of a prince named Suryaprabha, who became king of the Vidyadharas. The scene of action is mostly in the regions below or those above the earth, and the ''dramatis personae'' are the [[Naga]]s or snake-gods of [[Patala]] and the Vidyadharas of mid-air. In the ninth book (''Alamkaravati'') are narrated a number of stories for the consolation of Naravahanadatta, on the disappearance of his favorite bride Madanamanchuka, their subjects being the temporary separation and final reunion of faithful couples. They wind up with a compendious recital of the adventures of [[Nala]] and [[Damayanti]]. \n\n=== Book 10 ===\nThe next book (''Saktiyasas''), the tenth, is of still greater importance than any of its predecessors in the history of fiction, as it includes the whole of the ''[[Panchatantra]]''. The stories and the order in which they succeed agree better with the tales and arrangement of the ''Kalila wa Demna'' than even the ''Panchatantra'', and it would appear therefore that we have in the ''Kathasaritsagara'' an earlier representative of the original collection than even the Panchatantra, at least as it is now met with. We have in this book also what may be perhaps the original of another well-known story, that of King Shahryar and His Brother in the ''[[One Thousand and One Nights]]''. Two young Brahmins travelling are benighted in a forest, and take up their lodging in a tree near a lake. Early in the night a number of people come from the water, and having made preparation for an entertainment retire; a Yaksha, a genie, then comes out of the lake with his two wives, and spends the night there; when he and one of his wives are asleep, the other, seeing the youths, invites them to approach her, and to encourage them, shows them a hundred rings received from former gallants, notwithstanding her husband's precautions, who keeps her locked up in a chest at the bottom of the lake. The youths reject her advances; she wakes the genie who is going to put them to death, but the rings are produced in evidence against the unfaithful wife, and she is turned away with the loss of her nose.\n\n=== Books 11 to 13 ===\nThe eleventh book (''Vela'') is occupied with one story only, that of Vela, a damsel married to a merchant's son; the leading incidents are their shipwreck, separation and re-union. The twelfth book (''Sasankavati'') narrates the huge tale of Mrigankadatta, prince of Ayodhya. The scheme of this series of narratives is similar to that of the excellent and popular Sanskrit work, ascribed to [[Da\u1e47\u1e0din]], the [[Dashakumaracharita]], the Tale of the Ten Princes, in which a prince and his nine companions are separated for a season, and recount what has happened to each when they meet again. The stories, however, are different. The twelfth book is also important as it contains the plan and details of a collection of tales extremely popular in India, existing both in Sanskrit and in all the vernacular dialects, called the [[Vetala Panchavimshati]]: twenty-five tales of a Vetala being related by a sprite, who haunts cemeteries and animates dead bodies, to Vikramaditya, king of Ujjain, according to the usual version, to Trivikramasena, king of [[Pratishthan]], on the Godavari, according to the ''Kathasaritsagara''. The thirteenth book (''Madiravati'') is short and recounts the adventures of two young Brahmans, who effect secret marriages with a princess and her friend. The incidents are curious and diverting, but they are chiefly remarkable from being the same as the contrivances by which Madhava and Makaranda obtain their mistresses in the drama entitled ''Malatimadhava'' by [[Bhavabhuti]]. \n\n{{multiple image\n| total_width = 440\n| header = Illustrations from an edition of the Kathasaritsagara, c.1590\n| image1 = Tale of the Cunning Siddhikari.jpg\n| width1      = 520\n| height1     = 640\n| caption1 = ''Tale of the Cunning Siddhikari''\n| image2 = Somaprabha and a Celestial Nymph Listening to Music.jpg\n| width2      = 640\n| height2     = 610\n| caption2 = ''Somaprabha and a Celestial Nymph Listening to Music''\n}}\n\n=== Book 14 and 15 ===\nThe two next books, the fourteenth (''Panca'') and fifteenth (''Mahabhisheka''), the scene of action is laid chiefly amongst the fabulous regions of the Vidyadharas. In the first, the prince Naravahanadatta loses his queen Madanamanchuka to his rival Vidyadhara Manasavega, the prince subsequently makes an addition to his domestic arrangements, of five Vidyadhari wives and finally kills Manasavega and regains his queen. In the second, he is crowned emperor of the Vidyadhara race. \n\n=== Book 16 ===\nThe connecting thread of the series of tales should here terminate; but in the next book (''Suratamanjari''), the sixteenth, we have an account of the death of Udayana, who resigns his throne to Gopalaka, the brother of his wife Vasavadatta, and, accompanied by his wives and ministers, goes to Mount Kalanjana, where a heavenly chariot descends, and conveys them all to heaven. Gopalaka, inconsolable for the loss of his brother-in-law, soon relinquishes his regal state, and making over Kosambi to his younger brother, Palaka, repairs to the White Mountain, and spends the rest of his days in the hermitage of [[Kashyapa]]. We have then an account of the son of Palaka falling in love with a young girl of low caste, a Chandali, and different stories illustrative of unequal matches, some of which have been told before. A very convenient doctrine is maintained by Palaka's ministers, that the very circumstance of the prince's being enamoured of the Chandali is a proof that she cannot be truly of so base an origin, but that she must be a princess or goddess in disguise; otherwise it were impossible that she should have attracted the affections of any noble individual. They therefore counsel the king to demand the nymph of her father. The father consents, on condition that the Brahmins of Ujjain eat in his house. Palaka issues orders that the Brahmins, to the number of eighteen thousand, shall dine with the Chandala. They are of course in great alarm, as this is a virtual degradation and loss of caste, and they apply to [[Mahakala]], the form of Siva especially worshipped in Ujjain, to know what to do. He commands them in a dream to comply, as Matanga, the supposed Chandala, is in truth a Vidyadhara. He had conspired against the life of Naravahanadatta, in order to prevent his becoming emperor of the Vidyadharas, and had been therefore condemned by Siva to live in Ujjain with his family as Chandalas. The curse was to terminate when eighteen thousand Brahmins should eat in his house; and this being accomplished, he is restored to his rank, and his daughter is a fit bride for the son of the king. \n\n=== Books 17 and 18 ===\nThe two last books are composed of narratives told by Naravahanadatta, when on a visit to his uncle Gopalaka at the hermitage of Kashyapa. He repeats those stories which were communicated to him when he was separated from Madanamanchuka, to console him under the anguish of separation. The first book (''Padmavati'') treats entirely of the loves of Muktaphalaketu, a prince of the Vidyadharas, and Padmavati, daughter of the king of the Gandharvas. The former is condemned by a holy person to become a man, and he is thus for a season separated from the latter. He is, after a short time, restored to his station and his wife. The last book (''Visamasila'') is of a more diversified description, and has Vikramaditya or Vikramasila, son of Mahendraditya, king of Ujjain, for its hero, and describes his victories over hostile princes, and his acquirement of various princesses. These are interspersed with love adventures, some of which reiterate the calumnies against women, and with stories relating the tricks of professed cheats.\n\n==History: versions and translations==\n=== Sanskrit antecedents: ''B\u1e5bhatkath\u0101ma\u00f1jar\u012b'' and ''B\u1e5bhatkath\u0101\u015blokasa\u1e43graha'' ===\n==== ''B\u1e5bhatkath\u0101ma\u00f1jar\u012b'' ====\n{| class=\"wikitable floatright\"\n|+ style=\"text-align: center;\" | ''B\u1e5bhatkath\u0101ma\u00f1jar\u012b''\n|-\n!

The ''Kath\u0101sarits\u0101gara'' is not the only rendition of the ''B\u1e5bhatkath\u0101'', for twenty or thirty years previously K\u1e63emendra, the great Sanskrit aesthete from Kashmir, had written his ''B\u1e5bhatkath\u0101ma\u00f1jar\u012b'', an epitome of the ''B\u1e5bhatkath\u0101''. The ''Kath\u0101sarits\u0101gara'' and the ''B\u1e5bhatkath\u0101ma\u00f1jar\u012b'' agree in the number and the titles of the different ''lambhakas'' but, after ''lambhaka'' 5, disagree in the order of them, even to a considerable degree. However, all the books of the same name in both versions overlap with each other exactly (excluding a few minor details), except for two. Book 8 (''Vela'') in K\u1e63emendra is a combination of Book 11 (''Vela'') and the beginning of Book 14 (''Panca'') in ''Kath\u0101sarits\u0101gara''. Considering that K\u1e63emendra composed two near faithful extracts of the celebrated epics: the ''Bharatamanjari'' and the ''Ramayanamanjari'', it is more probable that it was K\u1e63emendra, and not Somadeva, who drew up the faithful reproduction of the old Paisaci poem. Compared with Somadeva\u2019s work, the ''B\u1e5bhatkath\u0101ma\u00f1jar\u012b'' pales into insignificance, lacking the charm of language, elegance of style, masterly arrangement and metrical skill of the later production. Moreover, K\u1e63emendra\u2019s collection is only a third the length of the ''Kath\u0101sarits\u0101gara'', the printed text amounting to a little more than 7,561 slokas. \n\nAs early as 1871 Professor B\u00fchler (''Indian Antiquary'', p. 302 et seq.) proved two important facts: firstly, that Somadeva and K\u1e63emendra used the same text, and secondly, that they worked entirely independently from one another. A ''B\u1e5bhatkath\u0101'' such as the two writers reproduced, a prose work in the Pai\u015b\u0101c\u012b dialect, existed, therefore, in Kashmir. But it was no longer the book which Gu\u1e47\u0101\u1e0dhya had composed. It was a huge compilation, incorporating not only many particular stories from heterogeneous sources, but even whole books such as the ''Pa\u00f1catantra'', the ''Vet\u0101lapa\u00f1cavi\u1e43\u015bati'' and the story of [[Nala]]. The charge of abridging, obscuring and dislocating the main narrative is valid, not against Somadeva and K\u1e63emendra, but against predecessors, whose work of amplification had been completed, so far as completion can be predicated, perhaps two or three centuries earlier.<ref>J. S. Speyer, ''Studies about the Kathasaritsagara'' (Wiesbaden: M. Sandig, 1968)</ref> \n\n==== ''B\u1e5bhatkath\u0101\u015blokasa\u1e43graha'' ====\nApart from the Kashmir redactions there exists a Sanskrit version of Gu\u1e47\u0101\u1e0dhya\u2019s work, bearing the title ''B\u1e5bhatkath\u0101\u015blokasa\u1e43graha,'' i.e. the \u201cGreat Tale: Verse Epitome.\u201d In spite of its rather unassuming title, it must in its complete form have been \u2014 for we possess only about six of the twenty-six l\u0101bhas, \u201cemprizes\u201d \u2014 of very considerable extent, say about 25,000 slokas or couplets. Its discoverer and editor, M. F\u00e9lix Lac\u00f4te, had published (''Essai sur Gu\u1e47\u0101\u1e0dhya et la B\u1e5bhatkath\u0101'', Paris, 1908) along with the text an elaborate discussion of all the questions of higher criticism relating to the ''Kath\u0101sarits\u0101gara'' and the other recensions. M. Lac\u00f4te\u2019s conclusions, which are developed with great perspicacity, may be summarised as follows.<ref>Lac\u00f4te, F\u00e9lix, ''Essai s\u00fbr Gu\u1e47\u0101\u1e0dhya et la B\u1e5bhatkath\u0101'' (Paris: Ernest Leroux, 1908)</ref>\n\nThe ''B\u1e5bhatkath\u0101\u015blokasa\u1e43graha'' of which the MS. came from Nepal, is the work of a Nepalese writer, by name Budhasv\u0101min. It is of relatively early date, say the eighth to the ninth century CE and is based upon the Pai\u015b\u0101ci original. In its arrangement, and still more in its contents, it differs widely from the Kashmir versions. The most significant feature of these differences, however, is that they are largely by way of defect. Great masses of the subsidiary tales in the ''Kath\u0101sarits\u0101gara'' are wanting, and thus the main narrative stands out in much greater distinctness and amplitude. It is not that K\u1e63emendra and Somadeva have greatly perverted the story although there are some rather considerable dislocations, which deface its logical coherence. The chief difference is that the story is reduced to a rather slender trickle, which tends to be lost in the deluge of adventitious matter. The Pai\u015b\u0101c\u012b original, though including, like other Indian narratives, a quota of incidental tales and episodes, was concerned predominantly with the actual adventures of Narav\u0101hanadatta, a hero of Gu\u1e47\u0101\u1e0dhya\u2019s own invention. \n\n=== Persian adaptations: ''Bahr al-asmar'' and ''Darya-yi asmar'' ===\n''Kath\u0101sarits\u0101gara'' was translated into Persian in Kashmir during the reign of [[Zain-ul-Abidin|Zayn al-\u2018Abidin]] (r. 1418/20-1470) under the name of ''Bahr al-asmar'' (\u201cOcean of Stories\u201d). Nowadays this version is not extant; it is known solely through the evidence from other sources. A likely reference to it can be found in the ''[[Rajatarangini]]'' by \u015ar\u012bvara (fl. 1459-1505). \u015ar\u012bvara, the poet laureate at the court, refers to the commissioning of the translation of Sanskrit works into Persian and vice versa by his patron Zayn al-\u2018Abidin, among them a translation of \u201ca digest of the ''[[B\u1e5bhatkath\u0101]]''\u201d (''b\u1e5bhatkath\u0101s\u0101ra'') which may refer to the ''Kath\u0101sarits\u0101gara''.<ref>Walter Slaje,\u201cKaschmir im Mittelalter und die Quellen der Geschichtswissenschaft,\u201d ''Indo-Iranian Journal'' 48, 1 (2005): 23.</ref>\n\nAnother Persian version was commissioned in the second half of the 16th century during [[Akbar]]\u2019s reign and accomplished by a certain Mustafa Khaliqdad \u2018Abbasi also known as the translator of other works. This work was presumably carried out after 1590 following the military annexation of Kashmir.<ref>Heike Franke, \u201cAkbar\u2019s Kath\u0101sarits\u0101gara: The Translator and Illustrations of an Imperial Manuscript,\u201d ''Muqarnas'' 27 (2010): 313\u2013356, 321-322.</ref> Abbasi named it ''Darya-yi asmar'' (\u201cRiver of Stories\u201d) to distinguish it from the Kashmirian translation. In its preface, \u02bfAbbasi mentions that he was assigned to rewrite an earlier version \u201cof the book ''barhatkata'' [\u2026] which the Kashmirian Brahmin Sumdevbat [\u2026] had shortened\u201d and which \u201csomeone had undertaken during Zayn al-\u2018Abidin\u2019s reign\u201d, being fraught with Arabic expressions, in a more readable style.\u201d In conformity with the Sanskrit text, the Persian adaptation is likewise divided into eighteen main chapters, called ''nahr'' (rivers), each subdivided into several ''mauj'' (waves).<ref>Khaliqdad \u2018Abbasi, Mustafa, ''Darya-yi asmar tarjuma-yi katasaritsagar'', ed. Tara Chand, Sayyid Amir Hasan \u2018Abidi (New Delhi: Aligarh Muslim University and Markaz-i tahqiqat-i farsi, Rayzan-i farhangi-yi sifarat-i jumhuri-yi islami-yi Iran, 1997).</ref> This translation was discovered around 1968-9 (National Museum, New Delhi no. 62.1005). It was edited by Dr. Tara Chand and Prof. Syed Amir Hasan Abidi. It is worth mentioning that today only two manuscripts of the Persian version are available; both are incomplete and contain only 8 out of the original 18 chapters of the Sanskrit version each, which Chand and \u2018Abidi based their edition upon.<ref>The Manuscripts are stored in the State Central Library of Hyderabad and the India Office Collection, London. See Khaliqdad \u2018Abbasi, ''Darya-yi asmar tarjuma-yi katasaritsagar'', Introduction, 8.</ref> \n\nIn contrast to other examples from similar kind of literature like Abu al-Ma\u02bfali Nasrullah Munshi\u2019s ''Kalila va Dimna'', the ''Darya-yi asmar'' was retold not in artificial prose (''nasr-i musajja\u2018'') aimed at connoisseurs but rather in simple prose with features that remind of an oral recital. In the Persian narrative we encounter a mix of adaptation techniques: some sections display a transfer close to the Indian version, whereas most parts indicate a more narrative approach. This means that special attention was given to the transmission of the narrated story and not to the preservation of as many textual features as possible. One of the adaptation techniques applied in the ''Kath\u0101sarits\u0101gara'' is the use of explanations and glosses to single words that refer to persons, objects or concepts. The translator-compiler \u2018Abb\u0101s\u012b remarks, for example, that \u201cthis story is elaborated upon in [other] Indian books\u201d, or comments on certain passages by adding: \u201c[\u2026] according to the sayings of the people of India [\u2026].\u201d The second type of strategy encountered is that of inserting poetic quotations from the pool of Persian poetry such as ''[[Gulistan (book)|Gulistan]]'', ''[[Hafez|Divan-i Hafiz]]'', ''Divan-i Salman-i Savaji'', ''Manzumat-i Sharaf al-Din Yazdi'', [[Nizami Ganjavi|Nizami]]\u2019s ''Khusrau-u-Shirin'', ''Makhzan al-asrar'', ''Haft paykar'', and various others.<ref>Anna Martin, \u201c\u2018Translator\u2019s Invisibility\u2019: Strategies of Adaptation in Persian Versions of Indian Tales from the Mughal Period,\u201d ''Iran Namag'', Volume 2, Number 2 (Summer 2017), XXIV-XXXVII.</ref>\n\n=== Printed editions and modern translations ===\nProfessor H. H. Wilson was the first European scholar who drew the attention of the Western world to this storehouse of fables. In 1824, he gave a summary of the first five books in the ''Oriental Quarterly Magazine''. The first edition of the work was undertaken by Professor Brockhaus. In 1839 he issued the first five chapters only, and it was not till 1862 that the remaining thirteen appeared. Both publications formed part of the ''Abhandlungen der Deutschen Morgenl\u00e4ndischen Gesellschaft''.\n\nIt was this text which C. H. Tawney used for his excellent translation (''Ocean of the River of Streams'') published by the Asiatic Society of Bengal in the ''Bibliotheca Indica'', 1880-1884 (the index not appearing till 1887). Brockhaus\u2019 edition was based primarily on six MSS., though in the second part of the work he apparently had not so many at his disposal. Tawney was not satisfied with several of Brockhaus\u2019 readings, and consequently made numerous fresh renderings or suggestions largely taken from MSS. borrowed from the Calcutta College and from three India Office MSS. lent him by Dr Rost.\n\nIn 1889 Durg\u0101pras\u0101d issued the Bombay edition, printed at the Nir\u1e47ayas\u0101gara Press, which was produced from Brockhaus\u2019 edition and two Bombay MSS. This is the latest text now available.\n\nIn 1919, N. M. Penzer first approached Tawney with the suggestion of reissuing his ''Ocean of the River of Streams''. But he revised and published Tawney\u2019s 2 volumes in 10 volumes in 1924. The first volume gave an introduction of Hindu fiction and the other famous story-collections like ''Panchatantra'', ''Hitopadesha'' etc. Volumes 2 to 10 published the original translation with extensive comments. Penzer invited different scholars to write forewords to each volume resulting in nine excellent essays dealing with all aspects of the great collection.\n\nA project to translate the full work into modern English prose, translated by Sir James Mallinson, began to appear in 2007 from the Clay Sanskrit Library, published by New York University Press. The translation was based on the Nirnaya Press\u2019s 1915 edition of the Sanskrit text, the edition favored by Sanskritists today. Currently available are 2 volumes of the projected 7-volume edition.\n\n==== Printed editions ====\n\n* {{citation | year=1889 | title = The Kath\u00e2sarits\u00e2gara of Somadevabhatta | editor1=Pandit Durg\u0101pras\u0101da | editor2=K\u0101\u015b\u012bn\u0101tha P\u0101\u1e47\u1e0dura\u1e45ga Paraba | publisher=The Nirnaya-S\u00e2gara Press | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=OKlDAAAAYAAJ}}\n* {{citation | year=1915 | title = The Kath\u00e2sarits\u00e2gara of Somadevabhatta | editor1=Pandit Durg\u0101pras\u0101da | editor2=K\u0101\u015b\u012bn\u0101tha P\u0101\u1e47\u1e0dura\u1e45ga Paraba | publisher=The Nirnaya-S\u00e2gara Press | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=OKlDAAAAYAAJ|last=|first=|volume=|pages=|edition=3rd|editor3-last=Wasudev Laxman Shastri Pansikar}}\n\n==== Translations ====\n\n*[[Charles Henry Tawney|C.

The [[Kom language (Cameroon)|Kom language]] is also called Kom or [[Itangikom]]\n\n==History==\nDuring the 19th century migration in [[Cameroon]], most tribes moved south in search of better economic opportunities. The Kom people, who originated from upper Mbam in Tikari, moved in search of fertile soils. They first settled in Babessi. While in Babessi, their population began to grow drastically, and rapidly. The Fon of Babessi feared a possible attack from the Kom people. He then tricked the Fon of kom (Njinabo I) into believing that the increase in their male population may some day lead to them being overthrown. The fon of Kom believed this and subsequently accepted his proposal to burn all the healthy men in two separate rooms.\n\nAfter the act was committed, the Fon of Kom realized that he had been tricked.  The Babessi Fon had built a secret door for his men to escape when the fire started.  Unable to bear the loss and betrayal, the Fon of Kom committed suicide by hanging himself. He died without a son.  Legend has it that a [[pythonidae|python]] appeared and led the people of Kom to their present settlement in Laikom.

Some buy right from Dubai; to retail in the main towns of [[Fundong]], [[Njinikom]] and [[Belo, Cameroon|Belo]].\n\n==Society, culture, customs==\nKom society is [[patriarchal]]. Males hold the vast majority of power and privilege, while females labour mostly in domestic roles in kitchens and on farms. A man's power and wealth is measured by the number of his wives. Polygamy is a thing of pride. This makes a man with one wife voiceless in a men's gathering. Girls get married as young as 15 years old.\n\nAlthough Kom males hold most of the power in day-to-day affairs, Kom society is [[matrilineal]] in matters of succession. In this way, Kom society differs significantly from other tribes of Cameroon. Lineage in the Kom culture continues on the side of the mother and not the father in such a way that when an adult Kom male dies, ownership of his property including his compound, wives and children is transferred to his nephew (son of his sister) and not his own son. The process of matrilineal succession in Kom society is more complex if a deceased male did not have a nephew to inherit his property. In this case, succession is continued on the side of first cousin. As of the late 20th century, this practice is growing obsolete.\n\nKom society also places a great emphasis on respect for elders.\n\nThere are numerous dance groups like the Njang and chong, which performs in many occasions including funerals. Prince Yerima Afo\u2019o kom and Ateh Bazor are two of Kom's most prominent folklore musicians.\n\n==External links==\n{{Commons category|Kom people}}\n{{Scholia|topic}}\n\n*[http://www.kompeople.org Kompeople.org]\n\n{{Ethnic groups in Cameroon}}\n{{Authority control}}\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Kom People (Cameroon)}}\n[[Category:Ethnic groups in Cameroon]]\n<references />\n", "text_old": "{{Unreferenced|date=December 2009}}\n{{multiple image\n<!-- Essential parameters -->\n| align =\n| total_width = 300\n| direction = horizontal\n| footer =\n<!-- Image 1 -->\n| image1 = Bekom-Porteur de coupe-Mus\u00e9e du quai Branly.jpg\n| width1 = 140\n| height1 =\n| alt1 =\n| caption1 = Antropomorphic figure; 19th century; wood; from [[Cameroon]]; [[Mus\u00e9e du quai Branly]] (Paris)\n<!-- Image 2 -->\n| image2 = Masque anthropomorphe, Bekom, Mus\u00e9e du quai Branly.jpg\n| width2 =\n| height2 =\n| alt2 =\n| caption2 = Antropomorphic mask; 19th-20th century; wood; from [[Cameroon]]; Mus\u00e9e du quai Branly\n<!-- Image 3 -->\n| image3 = Helmet Mask MET vs1977 45.jpg\n| width3 =\n| height3 =\n| alt3 =\n| caption3 = Black-and-white photo of a helmet mask; circa 1830-1855; wood, iron, copper, pigment & wax; [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]] (New York City)\n}}\nThe '''Kom''' are one of the principal ethnic groups of the North-West province of [[Cameroon]], where traditional government institutions are very important.

[[Coffee]]<ref>{{Cite book|title='Kfaang' and its technologies : towards a social history of mobility in Kom, Cameroon, 1928-1998|last=Nkwi, Walter Gam.|date=2011|publisher=African Studies Centre|isbn=9789054481010|oclc=725791942}}</ref> is the only cash crop produced in Kom. In trade, there are many cooperative unions that help in the marketing of coffee. Many Kom retailers buy stuff from places like [[Nigeria]], [[Bamenda]] and [[Baffoussam]]. Some buy right from Dubai; to retail in the main towns of [[Fundong]], [[Njinikom]] and [[Belo, Cameroon|Belo]].\n\n==Society, culture, customs==\nKom society is [[patriarchal]]. Males hold the vast majority of power and privilege, while females labour mostly in domestic roles in kitchens and on farms. A man's power and wealth is measured by the number of his wives. Polygamy is a thing of pride. This makes a man with one wife voiceless in a men's gathering. Girls get married as young as 15 years old.\n\nAlthough Kom males hold most of the power in day-to-day affairs, Kom society is [[matrilineal]] in matters of succession. In this way, Kom society differs significantly from other tribes of Cameroon. Lineage in the Kom culture continues on the side of the mother and not the father in such a way that when an adult Kom male dies, ownership of his property including his compound, wives and children is transferred to his nephew (son of his sister) and not his own son. The process of matrilineal succession in Kom society is more complex if a deceased male did not have a nephew to inherit his property. In this case, succession is continued on the side of first cousin. As of the late 20th century, this practice is growing obsolete.\n\nKom society also places a great emphasis on respect for elders.\n\nThere are numerous dance groups like the Njang and chong, which performs in many occasions including funerals. Prince Yerima Afo\u2019o kom and Ateh Bazor are two of Kom\u2019s most prominent folklore musicians.\n\n==External links==\n{{Commons category|Kom people}}\n{{Scholia|topic}}\n\n*[http://www.kompeople.org Kompeople.org]\n\n{{Ethnic groups in Cameroon}}\n{{Authority control}}\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Kom People (Cameroon)}}\n[[Category:Ethnic groups in Cameroon]]\n<references />\n", "name_user": "Iridescent", "label": "safe", "comment": "Cleanup andtypo fixing,typo(s) fixed: \u2019s \u2192 's (2)", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kom_people_(Cameroon)"}

Often thought to be a [[volcanic plug]], it is not.  Two other mamelons exist nearby, created in the same period: [[Camels Hump]], to the south on Mount Macedon and, to the east, Crozier's Rocks.{{citation needed|date=January 2012|reason=this appears to be a local name and contradictory to some sources}} Alternative names for Crozier's Rocks are Brock's Monument, Alexander's Head and Mount Crystal.  All three mamelons are composed of soda [[trachyte]]. As Hanging Rock's magma cooled and contracted it split into rough columns.  These weathered over time into the many pinnacles that can be seen today. \n\nThe significance of these three mamelons demonstrates the mechanism of plate tectonics.  As the Australian Plate moved northwards towards East Asia, over a period of 27 million years it passed over a volcanic hotspot. This resulted in a chain of volcanoes stretching from Hillsborough (33 million years ago) in Northern Queensland  to Hanging Rock (6.5 million years ago) which is part of the southernmost end of this volcanic activity.  This chain also includes the Warrumbungles (New South Wales, 15.5 million years ago) and the Glass House Mountains (Southern Queensland, 24.3 million years ago). These volcanoes all have the same chemical composition.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Hanging rock : a history|last=McConville|first=Chris|publisher=Friends of Hanging Rock Inc.|year=2017|isbn=9780648166603|edition=First|location=Woodend, Vic.|pages=65|oclc=1011492509}}</ref> <ref>{{Cite journal|last=Wellman|first=P.|date=20 July 1983|title=Hotspot Volcanism in Australia and New Zealand: Cainozoic and Mid-Mesozoic|url=|doi=10.1016/0040-1951(83)90219-6|journal=Tectonophysics|volume=Volume 96, Issues 3\u20134|pages=225\u201343}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal|last=Wellman, P.

The novel dealt with the disappearance of a number of schoolgirls during a visit to the site. Their disappearance was explained in the final chapter, but Lindsay deleted this chapter at the suggestion of her editor, thinking the mystery was greater without it.\n\nThe novel inspired the film ''[[Picnic at Hanging Rock (film)|Picnic at Hanging Rock]]'', made in 1975 and directed by [[Peter Weir]].

Yvonne Rousseau wrote a book called ''The Murders at Hanging Rock'', published in 1980, which examined possible explanations for the disappearance of the girls.\n\nThe deleted final chapter of the novel was finally published in 1987 after the death of Joan Lindsay.

Often thought to be a [[volcanic plug]], it is not.  Two other mamelons exist nearby, created in the same period: [[Camels Hump]], to the south on Mount Macedon and, to the east, Crozier's Rocks.{{citation needed|date=January 2012|reason=this appears to be a local name and contradictory to some sources}} Alternative names for Crozier's Rocks are Brock's Monument, Alexander's Head and Mount Crystal.  All three mamelons are composed of soda [[trachyte]]. As Hanging Rock's magma cooled and contracted it split into rough columns.  These weathered over time into the many pinnacles that can be seen today. \n\nThe significance of these three mamelons demonstrates the mechanism of plate tectonics.  As the Australian Plate moved northwards towards East Asia, over a period of 27 million years it passed over a volcanic hotspot. This resulted in a chain of volcanoes stretching from Hillsborough (33 million years ago) in Northern Queensland  to Hanging Rock (6.5 million years ago) which is part of the southernmost end of this volcanic activity.  This chain also includes the Warrumbungles (New South Wales, 15.5 million years ago) and the Glass House Mountains (Southern Queensland, 24.3 million years ago). These volcanoes all have the same chemical composition.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Hanging rock : a history|last=McConville|first=Chris|publisher=Friends of Hanging Rock Inc.|year=2017|isbn=9780648166603|edition=First|location=Woodend, Vic.|pages=65|oclc=1011492509}}</ref> <ref>{{Cite journal|last=Wellman|first=P.|date=20 July 1983|title=Hotspot Volcanism in Australia and New Zealand: Cainozoic and Mid-Mesozoic|url=|doi=10.1016/0040-1951(83)90219-6|journal=Tectonophysics|volume=Volume 96, Issues 3\u20134|pages=225\u201343}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal|last=Wellman, P.

The interpretation process that occurs between interactions helps create and recreate meaning. It is the shared understanding and interpretations of meaning that affect the interaction between individuals. Individuals act on the premise of a shared understanding of meaning within their social context. Thus, interaction and behavior is framed through the shared meaning that objects and concepts have attached to them. From this view, people live in both natural and symbolic environments. \n\nSymbolic interactionism comes from a [[sociology|sociological]] perspective which developed around the middle of the twentieth century and that continues to be influential in some areas of the discipline. It is particularly important in [[microsociology]] and [[Social psychology (sociology)|social psychology]].

Strangely, he never set forth his wide-ranging ideas in a book or systematic treatise. After his death in 1931, his students pulled together class notes and conversations their mentor and published ''[[Mind, Self and Society]]'' in his name.<ref name=\":2\" /> It is a common misconception that [[John Dewey]] was the leader of this sociological theory; according to ''The Handbook of Symbolic Interactionism,'' Mead was undoubtedly the individual who \"transformed the inner structure of the theory, moving it to a higher level of theoretical complexity.\"<ref name=\":3\">Reynolds, Larry T., and Nancy J.

This means that humans exist not in the physical space composed of realities, but in the \"world\" composed only of \"objects\".\n\nThree assumptions frame symbolic interactionism:<ref name=\":1\" />\n# ''Individuals construct meaning via the communication process.''\n# ''[[Self-concept]] is a motivation for behavior.''\n# ''A unique relationship exists between the individual and society.''\n\n=== Premises ===\nHaving defined some of the underlying assumptions of symbolic interactionism, it is necessary to address the premises that each assumption supports. According to Blumer (1969), there are three premises that can be derived from the assumptions above.<ref name=\":4\" />\n\n1) '''''\"Humans act toward things on the basis of the meanings they ascribe to those things.\"'''''<ref name=\":4\" />\n\nThe first premise includes everything that a human being may note in their world, including physical objects, actions and concepts. Essentially, individuals behave towards objects and others based on the personal meanings that the individual has already given these items. Blumer was trying to put emphasis on the meaning behind individual behaviors, specifically speaking, psychological and sociological explanations for those actions and behaviors.\n\n2) '''''\"The meaning of such things is derived from, or arises out of, the social interaction that one has with others and the society.\"'''''<ref name=\":4\" />\n\nThe second premise explains the meaning of such things is derived from, or arises out of, the social interaction that one has with other humans. Blumer, following Mead, claimed people interact with each other by interpreting or defining each other's actions instead of merely reacting to each other's actions. Their \"response\" is not made directly to the actions of one another but instead is based on the meaning which they attach to such actions. Thus, human interaction is mediated by the use of [[Significant symbols|symbols]] and [[Sign (semiotics)|signification]], by [[Language interpretation|interpretation]], or by ascertaining the meaning of one another's actions. [[Meaning (linguistics)|Meaning]] is either taken for granted and pushed aside as an unimportant element which need not to be investigated, or it is regarded as a mere neutral link or one of the [[causal chain]]s between the causes or factors responsible for human behavior and this behavior as the product of such factors.\n\n3) '''''\"The Meanings are handled in, and modified through, an interpretative process used by the person in dealing with the things he/she encounters.\"'''''\n\nSymbolic interactionists describe thinking as an [[Inner conversations|inner conversation]].<ref name=\":2\" /> Mead called this inner dialogue ''minding'', which is the delay in one's thought process that happens when one thinks about what they will do next. These meanings are handled in, and modified through, an interpretive process{{efn|This process occurs in the form of ''interaction with oneself'' or ''taking into account of taking into account''.}}<ref>Kuwabara T., and K.

We naturally talk to ourselves in order to sort out the meaning of a difficult situation. But first, we need language. Before we can think, we must be able to interact symbolically.<ref name=\":2\" /> The emphasis on symbols, negotiated meaning, and social construction of society brought attention to the [[role]]s people play. [[Role-taking theory|Role-taking]] is a key mechanism that permits people to see another person's perspective to understand what an action might mean to another person. Role-taking is a part of our lives at an early age, for instance, playing house and pretending to be someone else. There is an improvisational quality to roles; however, [[Free will|actors]] often take on a script that they follow. Because of the uncertainty of roles in social contexts, the burden of role-making is on the person in the situation. In this sense, we are proactive participants in our environment.<ref name=\":5\">{{Cite book|last=Garfinkel|first=Harold|title=Studies in Ethnomethodology|publisher=Prentice-Hall|year=1967|isbn=978-0745600055|location=Englewood Cliffs, NJ|pages=|oclc=356659}}</ref>\n\n=== Research methodology ===\nThe majority of interactionist research uses [[qualitative research]] methods, like [[participant observation]], to study aspects of [[social interaction]], and/or individuals' selves. Participant observation allows researchers to access symbols and meanings, as in [[Howard S. Becker|Howard Becker]]'s ''Art Worlds'' and [[Arlie Russell Hochschild|Arlie Hochschild]]'s ''[[The Managed Heart]]''.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.encyclopedia.com/social-sciences-and-law/sociology-and-social-reform/sociology-general-terms-and-concepts/symbolic-interactionism#symbolicinteractionism|title=Symbolic Interactionism|date=|website=www.encyclopedia.com|language=en|others=International Encyclopedia of Marriage and Family|archive-url=|archive-date=|url-status=|access-date=2011-09-20}}</ref> They argue that close contact and immersion in the everyday activities of the participants is necessary for understanding the meaning of actions, defining situations and the process that actors construct the situation through their interaction. Because of this close contact, interactions cannot remain completely liberated of value commitments. In most cases, they make use of their values in choosing what to study; however, they seek to be objective in how they conduct the research. Therefore, the symbolic-interaction approach is a micro-level orientation focusing on human interaction in specific situations.\n\n==Five central ideas==\n\nThere are five central ideas to symbolic interactionism according to [[Joel M. Charon]] (2004):<ref>{{cite book|last=Charon|first=Joel M.|title=Symbolic Interactionism: An Introduction, An Interpretation, An Integration|publisher=Pearson|year=2004|isbn=978-0-13-605193-0|location=Boston|page=31}}</ref>\n\n#\"The human being must be understood as a social person. It is the constant search for social interaction that leads us to do what we do. Instead of focusing on the individual and his or her personality, or on how the society or social situation causes human behavior, symbolic interactionism focuses on the activities that take place between actors. Interaction is the basic unit of study. Individuals are created through interaction; society too is created through social interaction. What we do depends on interaction with others earlier in our lifetimes, and it depends on our interaction right now. Social interaction is central to what we do. If we want to understand cause, focus on social interaction.\n#The human being must be understood as a thinking being. Human action is not only interaction among individuals but also interaction within the individual. It is not our ideas or attitudes or values that are as important as the constant active ongoing process of thinking. We are not simply conditioned, we are not simply beings who are influenced by those around us, we are not simply products of society. We are, to our very core, thinking animals, always conversing with ourselves as we interact with others. If we want to understand cause, focus on human thinking.\n#Humans do not sense their environment directly, instead, humans define the situation they are in. An environment may actually exist, but it is our definition of it that is important. Definition does not simply randomly happen; instead, it results from ongoing social interaction and thinking. \n#The cause of human action is the result of what is occurring in our present situation. Cause unfolds in the present social interaction, present thinking, and present definition. It is not society's encounters with us in our past, that causes action nor is it our own past experience that does. It is, instead, social interaction, thinking, definition of the situation that takes place in the present. Our past enters into our actions primarily because we think about it and apply it to the definition of the present situation. \n#Human beings are described as active beings in relation to their environment. Words such as conditioning, responding, controlled, imprisoned, and formed are not used to describe the human being in symbolic interaction. In contrast to other social-scientific perspectives humans are not thought of as being passive in relation to their surroundings, but actively involved in what they do.\"\n\n==Central interactionist themes==\nTo Blumer's conceptual perspective, he put them in three core propositions: that people act toward things, including each other, on the basis of the meanings they have for them; that these meanings are derived through social interaction with others; and that these meanings are managed and transformed through an interpretive process that people use to make sense of and handle the objects that constitute their social worlds. This perspective can also be described as three core principles- Meaning, Language and Thinking- in which social constructs are formed. The principle of meaning is the center of human behavior. Language provides meaning by providing means to symbols. These symbols differentiate social relations of humans from that of animals. By humans giving meaning to symbols, they can express these things with language. In turn, symbols form the basis of communication. Symbols become imperative components for the formation of any kind of communicative act. Thinking then changes the interpretation of individuals as it pertains to symbols.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.colorado.edu/Communications/meta-discourse/Papers/App_Papers/Nelson.htm|title=Herbert Blumer's symbolic interactionism|last=Nelson|first=Lindsey D.|date=1998|website=University of Colorado Boulder|url-status=dead|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref>\n\n=== Snow's Four Principles ===\nKeeping Blumer's earlier work in mind [[David A. Snow]], professor of sociology at the [[University of California, Irvine]], suggests four broader and even more basic orienting principles: [[human agency]], interactive determination, symbolization, and [[emergence]]. Snow uses these four principles as the thematic bases for identifying and discussing contributions to the study of social movements.\n\n# '''Human agency''': emphasizes the active, willful, goal-seeking character of human actors. The emphasis on agency focuses attention on those actions, events, and moments in social life in which agentic action is especially palpable.\n# '''Interactive determination''': specifies that understanding of focal objects of analysis, whether they are self-concepts, identities, roles, practices, or even social movements. Basically this means, neither individual, society, self, or others exist only in relation to each other and therefore can be fully understood only in terms of their interaction.\n# '''Symbolization''''':'' highlights the processes through which events and conditions, artifacts, people, and other environmental features that take on particular meanings, becoming nearly only objects of orientation. Human behavior is partly contingent on what the object of orientation symbolizes or means.\n# '''Emergence''': focuses on attention on the processual and non-habituated side of social life, focusing not only on organization and texture of social life, but also associated meaning and feelings. The principal of emergence tells us not only to possibility of new forms of social life and system meaning but also to transformations in existing forms of social organization.<ref name=\":3\" />\n\n== Applications ==\nSymbolic interaction can be used to explain one's identity in terms of roles being \"ideas and principles on 'what to do' in a given situation,\" as noted by Hewitt.<ref name=\":03\">{{Cite journal|last=|first=|date=2012|title=Symbolic interactionist perspective on linking privacy and identity in social networking sites|url=https://web-b-ebscohost-com.libdata.lib.ua.edu/ehost/pdfviewer/pdfviewer?vid=1&sid=11c6a4ba-2f40-42a8-9384-bba00a780929%40sessionmgr103|journal=International Communication Association|series=Conference Papers|volume=|pages=1\u201327|via=}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book|last=Hewitt|first=J.

Situated identity refers to the ability to view themselves as others do. This is often a snapshot view in that it is short, but can be very impactful. From this experience, one wishes to differentiate themselves from others and the personal identity comes to exist. This view is when one wishes to make themselves known for who they truly are, not the view of others. From the personal identity taking place, comes the social identity where connections and likeness are made with individuals sharing similar identities or identity traits.<ref name=\":03\" />\n\nThis viewpoint of symbolic interactionism can be applied to the use of social networking sites and how one's identity is presented on those sites. With social networking sites, one can boast (or post) their identity through their newsfeed. The personal identity presents itself in the need for individuals to post milestones that one has achieved, in efforts to differentiate themselves. The social identity presents itself when individuals \"tag\" others in their posts, pictures, etc.  <ref name=\":03\" /> Situated identities may be present in the need to defend something on social media or arguments that occur in comments, where one feels it necessary to \"prove\" themselves.\n\nComing from the viewpoint that we learn, or at least desire, how to expect other people's reactions/responses to things, Bruce Link and his colleagues studied how expectations of the reactions of others can affect the mental illness stigma. The participants of the study were individuals with psychosis who answered questions relating to discrimination, stigma, and rejection. The goal of the study was to determine whether others' expectations affect the participants' internalized stigmas, anticipated rejection, concerns with staying in, and other. Results found that high levels of internalized stigma were only present in the minority, however, anticipation of rejection, stigma consciousness, perceived devaluation discrimination and concerns with staying in were found to be more prevalent in participants. These perceptions were correlated with the outcomes of withdrawal, self-esteem and isolation from relatives. The study found that anticipation of rejection played the largest role in internalized stigmas.<ref>Link, Bruce, Jennifer Wells, Jo Phelan, Lawrence Yang. 2015. \"Understanding the importance of 'symbolic interaction stigma': How expectations about the reactions of others adds to the burden of mental illness stigma.\" ''[[Psychiatric Rehabilitation Journal]]'' 38(2):117\u201324.

As a result, people act in their communities according to the meanings they derive about their environment, whether online or offline, from those interactions. This perspective reveals that online communication may very well take on different meanings for different people depending on information, circumstance, relationships, power, and other systems that make up [[communities of practice]]. People enact community the way it is conceived and the meaning of community evolves as they come up with new ways to utilize it. Given this reality, scholars are continually challenged to research and understand how online communities are comprised, how they function, and how they are connected to offline social life.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Fernback|first=Jan|date=February 2007|title=Beyond the diluted community concept: A symbolic interactionist perspective on online social relations|url=https://semanticscholar.org/paper/3ce2c1676e77d3be084222973e5e93c5916d622e|journal=New Media & Society|language=en|volume=9|issue=1|pages=49\u201369|doi=10.1177/1461444807072417|issn=1461-4448|via=}}</ref>\n\nSymbolic interaction theory was discussed in ''The Cyberself: The Self-ing Project goes online, Symbolic Interaction in the Digital Age''.

It is argued that the theory is not one theory, but rather, the [[Conceptual framework|''framework'']] for many different theories. Additionally, some theorists have a problem with symbolic interaction theory due to its lack of [[testability]]. These objections, combined with the fairly narrow focus of interactionist research on small-group interactions and other social psychological issues, have relegated the interactionist camp to a minority position among sociologists (albeit a fairly substantial minority). Much of this criticism arose during the 1970s in the U.S. when [[quantitative research|quantitative]] approaches to sociology were dominant, and perhaps the best known of these is by [[Alvin Ward Gouldner|Alvin Gouldner]].<ref>{{Cite book|last=Gouldner|first=Alvin Ward|title=The Coming Crisis of Western Sociology|publisher=Heinemann|year=1971|isbn=978-0435821500|location=London|pages=|oclc=16192914}}</ref>\n\n===Framework and theories===\nSome critiques of symbolic interactionism are based on the assumption that it is a [[theory]], and the critiques apply the criteria for a \"good\" theory to something that does not claim to be a theory. Some critics find the symbolic interactionist framework too broad and general when they are seeking specific theories. Symbolic interactionism is a theoretical ''framework'' rather than a theory{{efn|see: Stryker and Vryan (2006) for a clear distinction between the two as it pertains to [[Interactionism|interactionist]]-inspired conceptualizations.}}<ref>{{cite book|title=Handbook of Social Psychology|last=Stryker|first1=Sheldon|last2=Vryan|first2=Kevin D.|date=January 2006|isbn=978-0-387-32515-6|location=|pages=3\u201328|chapter=The Symbolic Interactionist Frame|doi=10.1007/0-387-36921-X_1|issn=1389-6903|accessdate=2018-09-22|chapter-url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/227124775|series=Handbooks of Sociology and Social Research}}</ref> and can be assessed on the basis of effective conceptualizations. The theoretical framework, as with any theoretical framework, is vague when it comes to analyzing [[empirical data]] or predicting outcomes in social life. As a framework rather than a theory, many scholars find it difficult to use. Interactionism being a framework rather than a theory makes it impossible to test interactionism in the manner that a specific theoretical claim about the relationship between specific variables in a given context allows. Unlike the symbolic interactionist framework, the many theories derived from symbolic interactionism, such as [[role theory]] and the versions of identity theory developed by [[Sheldon Stryker]],<ref name=\":6\">{{Cite journal|last=Stryker|first=Sheldon|date=1968|title=Identity salience and role performance: The relevance of symbolic interaction theory for family research|url=|journal=Journal of Marriage and Family|volume=30|issue=4|pages=558\u201364|doi=10.2307/349494|jstor=349494}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal|last=Stryker|first=Sheldon|date=January 1994|title=Identity theory: Its development, research base, and prospects|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/285539542|journal=Studies in Symbolic Interaction|volume=16|pages=9\u201320|via=ResearchGate}}</ref> as well as Peter Burke and colleagues,<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Burke|first=Peter J.|date=1980|title=The self: Measurement requirements from an interactionist perspective|url=|journal=Social Psychology Quarterly|volume=43|issue=1|pages=18\u201329|doi=10.2307/3033745|jstor=3033745}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal|last=Burke|first=Peter J.|last2=Reitzes|first2=Donald C.|date=1981|title=The link between identity and role performance|url=https://semanticscholar.org/paper/b6a4aa6b219fbd95a5e1a9719a685a9c56843fd4|journal=Social Psychology Quarterly|volume=44|issue=2|pages=83\u201392|doi=10.2307/3033704|jstor=3033704|via=}}</ref> clearly define concepts and the relationships between them in a given context, thus allowing for the opportunity to develop and test hypotheses. Further, especially among Blumerian processual interactionists, a great number of very useful conceptualizations have been developed and applied in a very wide range of social contexts, types of populations, types of behaviors, and cultures and subcultures.\n\n===Social structure===\nSymbolic interactionism is often related and connected with social structure. This concept suggests that symbolic interactionism is a construction of people's social reality.<ref name=\":6\" /> It also implies that from a realistic point of view, the interpretations that are being made will not make much difference. When the reality of a situation is defined, the situation becomes a meaningful reality. This includes methodological criticisms, and critical sociological issues. A number of symbolic interactionists have addressed these topics, the best known being Stryker's structural symbolic interactionism<ref name=\":6\" /><ref>Stryker, Sheldon. 1980. ''Symbolic Interactionism: A Social Structural Version''. Menlo Park, Calif.: [[Benjamin/Cummings Pub. Co.]] {{ISBN|9780805391541}}. [[OCLC]] [https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/5707030 5707030].</ref> and the formulations of interactionism heavily influenced by this approach (sometimes referred to as the \"Indiana School\" of symbolic interactionism), including the works of key scholars in sociology and psychology using different methods and theories applying a [[Structuralism|structural]] version of interactionism that are represented in a 2003 collection edited by Burke ''et al''.<ref>Burke, Peter, Timothy J. Owens, Richard T. Serpe, and Peggy  A. Thoits. 2003. ''Advances in Identity Theory and Research''. Boston: [[Springer Publishing|Springer]]. {{ISBN|9781441991881}}. [[OCLC]]&nbsp;[https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/853269009 853269009].</ref> Another well-known structural variation of symbolic interactionism that applies quantitative methods is Manford H. Kuhn's formulation which is often referred to in sociological literature as the \"Iowa School.\" [[Negotiated order|Negotiated order theory]] also applies a structural approach.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Day|first=Robert|last2=Day|first2=JoAnne V.|date=January 1977|title=A review of the current state of negotiated order theory: An appreciation and a critique|url=|journal=The Sociological Quarterly|language=en|volume=18|issue=1|pages=126\u201342|doi=10.1111/j.1533-8525.1977.tb02165.x|issn=0038-0253}}</ref>\n\n==== Language ====\nLanguage is viewed as the source of all meaning.<ref name=\":5\" /> Blumer illuminates several key features about social interactionism. Most people interpret things based on assignment and purpose. The interaction occurs once the meaning of something has become identified. This concept of meaning is what starts to construct the framework of social reality. By aligning social reality, Blumer suggests that language is the meaning of interaction. Communication, especially in the form of symbolic interactionism is connected with language. Language initiates all forms of communication, verbal and non-verbal. Blumer defines this source of meaning as a connection that arises out of the social interaction that people have with each other.\n\n==== Critical perspective ====\nAccording to [[social theorist]] Patricia Burbank, the concepts of synergistic and diverging properties are what shape the viewpoints of humans as social beings. These two concepts are different in a sense because of their views of human freedom and their level of focus. According to Burbank, actions are based on the effects of situations that occur during the process of social interaction. Another important factor in meaningful situations is the environment in which the social interaction occurs. The environment influences interaction, which leads to a reference group and connects with perspective, and then concludes to a definition of the situation. This illustrates the proper steps to define a situation. An approval of the action occurs once the situation is defined. An interpretation is then made upon that action, which may ultimately influence the perspective, action, and definition.\n\nStryker emphasizes that the sociology world at large is the most viable and vibrant intellectual framework.<ref name=\":6\" /> By being made up of our thoughts and self-belief, the social interactionism theory is the purpose of all human interaction, and is what causes society to exist. This fuels criticisms of the symbolic interactionist framework for failing to account for social structure, as well as criticisms that interactionist theories cannot be assessed via [[Quantitative Methods|quantitative methods]], and cannot be [[Falsifiability|falsifiable]] or tested [[Empiricism|empirically]]. Framework is important for the symbolic interaction theory because for in order for the social structure to form, there are certain bonds of communication that need to be established to create the interaction. Much of the symbolic interactionist framework's basic tenets can be found in a very wide range of sociological and psychological work, without being explicitly cited as interactionist, making the influence of symbolic interactionism difficult to recognize given this general acceptance of its assumptions as \"common knowledge.\"\n\nAnother problem with this model is two-fold, in that it 1) does not take into account human emotions very much, implying that symbolic interaction is not completely psychological; and 2) is interested in social structure to a limited extent, implying that symbolic interaction is not completely sociological. These incompetencies frame meaning as something that occurs naturally within an interaction under a certain condition, rather than taking into account the basic social context in which interaction is positioned. From this view, meaning has no source and does not perceive a social reality beyond what humans create with their own interpretations.<ref>Aksan, Nilgun, Buket Kisac, Mufit Aydin, and Sumeyra Demirbuken. 2009. \"Symbolic Interaction Theory.\" ''Procedia \u2013 Social and Behavioral Sciences'' 1(1): 902\u20134.

Thus, interaction and behavior is framed through the shared meaning that objects and concepts have attached to them. From this view, people live in both natural and symbolic environments. \n\nSymbolic interactionism comes from a [[sociology|sociological]] perspective which developed around the middle of the twentieth century and that continues to be influential in some areas of the discipline.

Strangely, he never set forth his wide-ranging ideas in a book or systematic treatise. After his death in 1931, his students pulled together class notes and conversations their mentor and published ''[[Mind, Self and Society]]'' in his name.<ref name=\":2\" /> It is a common misconception that [[John Dewey]] was the leader of this sociological theory; according to ''The Handbook of Symbolic Interactionism,'' Mead was undoubtedly the individual who \"transformed the inner structure of the theory, moving it to a higher level of theoretical complexity.\"<ref name=\":3\">Reynolds, Larry T., and Nancy J.

''Mind'' refers to an individual's ability to use symbols to create meanings for the world around the individual \u2013 individuals use language and thought to accomplish this goal. ''Self'' refers to an individual's ability to reflect on the way that the individual is perceived by others. Finally, ''society'', according to Mead, is where all of these interactions are taking place.

According to [[behaviorism]], [[Darwinism]], [[pragmatism]], as well as [[Max Weber]], [[Action theory (philosophy)|action theory]] contributed significantly to the formation of social interactionism as a theoretical perspective in [[communication studies]].<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n==Assumptions, premises, and research methodology==\n=== Assumptions ===\nMost symbolic interactionists believe a physical reality does indeed exist by an individual's social definitions, and that social definitions do develop in part or in relation to something \"real\". People thus do not respond to this reality directly, but rather to the [[Social reality|social understanding of reality]]; i.e., they respond to this reality indirectly through a kind of filter which consists of individuals' different perspectives. This means that humans exist not in the physical space composed of realities, but in the \"world\" composed only of \"objects\".\n\nThree assumptions frame symbolic interactionism:<ref name=\":1\" />\n# ''Individuals construct meaning via the communication process.''\n# ''[[Self-concept]] is a motivation for behavior.''\n# ''A unique relationship exists between the individual and society.''\n\n=== Premises ===\nHaving defined some of the underlying assumptions of symbolic interactionism, it is necessary to address the premises that each assumption supports. According to Blumer (1969), there are three premises that can be derived from the assumptions above.<ref name=\":4\" />\n\n1) '''''\"Humans act toward things on the basis of the meanings they ascribe to those things.\"'''''<ref name=\":4\" />\n\nThe first premise includes everything that a human being may note in their world, including physical objects, actions and concepts. Essentially, individuals behave towards objects and others based on the personal meanings that the individual has already given these items. Blumer was trying to put emphasis on the meaning behind individual behaviors, specifically speaking, psychological and sociological explanations for those actions and behaviors.\n\n2) '''''\"The meaning of such things is derived from, or arises out of, the social interaction that one has with others and the society.\"'''''<ref name=\":4\" />\n\nThe second premise explains the meaning of such things is derived from, or arises out of, the social interaction that one has with other humans. Blumer, following Mead, claimed people interact with each other by interpreting or defining each other's actions instead of merely reacting to each other's actions. Their \"response\" is not made directly to the actions of one another but instead is based on the meaning which they attach to such actions. Thus, human interaction is mediated by the use of [[Significant symbols|symbols]] and [[Sign (semiotics)|signification]], by [[Language interpretation|interpretation]], or by ascertaining the meaning of one another's actions. [[Meaning (linguistics)|Meaning]] is either taken for granted and pushed aside as an unimportant element which need not to be investigated, or it is regarded as a mere neutral link or one of the [[causal chain]]s between the causes or factors responsible for human behavior and this behavior as the product of such factors.\n\n3) '''''\"The Meanings are handled in, and modified through, an interpretative process used by the person in dealing with the things he/she encounters.\"'''''\n\nSymbolic interactionists describe thinking as an [[Inner conversations|inner conversation]].<ref name=\":2\" /> Mead called this inner dialogue ''minding'', which is the delay in one's thought process that happens when one thinks about what they will do next. These meanings are handled in, and modified through, an interpretive process{{efn|This process occurs in the form of ''interaction with oneself'' or ''taking into account of taking into account''.}}<ref>Kuwabara T., and K. Yamaguchi. 2013. \"An Introduction to the Sociological Perspective of Symbolic Interactionism.\" ''The Joint Journal of the National Universities in Kyushu, Education and Humanities'' 1(1):1-11.</ref> used by the person in dealing with the things he or she encounters. We naturally talk to ourselves in order to sort out the meaning of a difficult situation. But first, we need language. Before we can think, we must be able to interact symbolically.<ref name=\":2\" /> The emphasis on symbols, negotiated meaning, and social construction of society brought attention to the [[role]]s people play. [[Role-taking theory|Role-taking]] is a key mechanism that permits people to see another person's perspective to understand what an action might mean to another person. Role-taking is a part of our lives at an early age, for instance, playing house and pretending to be someone else. There is an improvisational quality to roles; however, [[Free will|actors]] often take on a script that they follow. Because of the uncertainty of roles in social contexts, the burden of role-making is on the person in the situation. In this sense, we are proactive participants in our environment.<ref name=\":5\">{{Cite book|last=Garfinkel|first=Harold|title=Studies in Ethnomethodology|publisher=Prentice-Hall|year=1967|isbn=978-0745600055|location=Englewood Cliffs, NJ|pages=|oclc=356659}}</ref>\n\n=== Research methodology ===\nThe majority of interactionist research uses [[qualitative research]] methods, like [[participant observation]], to study aspects of [[social interaction]], and/or individuals' selves. Participant observation allows researchers to access symbols and meanings, as in [[Howard S. Becker|Howard Becker]]'s ''Art Worlds'' and [[Arlie Russell Hochschild|Arlie Hochschild]]'s ''[[The Managed Heart]]''.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.encyclopedia.com/social-sciences-and-law/sociology-and-social-reform/sociology-general-terms-and-concepts/symbolic-interactionism#symbolicinteractionism|title=Symbolic Interactionism|date=|website=www.encyclopedia.com|language=en|others=International Encyclopedia of Marriage and Family|archive-url=|archive-date=|url-status=|access-date=2011-09-20}}</ref> They argue that close contact and immersion in the everyday activities of the participants is necessary for understanding the meaning of actions, defining situations and the process that actors construct the situation through their interaction. Because of this close contact, interactions cannot remain completely liberated of value commitments. In most cases, they make use of their values in choosing what to study; however, they seek to be objective in how they conduct the research. Therefore, the symbolic-interaction approach is a micro-level orientation focusing on human interaction in specific situations.\n\n==Five central ideas==\n\nThere are five central ideas to symbolic interactionism according to [[Joel M. Charon]] (2004):<ref>{{cite book|last=Charon|first=Joel M.|title=Symbolic Interactionism: An Introduction, An Interpretation, An Integration|publisher=Pearson|year=2004|isbn=978-0-13-605193-0|location=Boston|page=31}}</ref>\n\n#\"The human being must be understood as a social person. It is the constant search for social interaction that leads us to do what we do. Instead of focusing on the individual and his or her personality, or on how the society or social situation causes human behavior, symbolic interactionism focuses on the activities that take place between actors. Interaction is the basic unit of study. Individuals are created through interaction; society too is created through social interaction. What we do depends on interaction with others earlier in our lifetimes, and it depends on our interaction right now. Social interaction is central to what we do. If we want to understand cause, focus on social interaction.\n#The human being must be understood as a thinking being. Human action is not only interaction among individuals but also interaction within the individual. It is not our ideas or attitudes or values that are as important as the constant active ongoing process of thinking. We are not simply conditioned, we are not simply beings who are influenced by those around us, we are not simply products of society. We are, to our very core, thinking animals, always conversing with ourselves as we interact with others. If we want to understand cause, focus on human thinking.\n#Humans do not sense their environment directly, instead, humans define the situation they are in. An environment may actually exist, but it is our definition of it that is important. Definition does not simply randomly happen; instead, it results from ongoing social interaction and thinking. \n#The cause of human action is the result of what is occurring in our present situation. Cause unfolds in the present social interaction, present thinking, and present definition. It is not society's encounters with us in our past, that causes action nor is it our own past experience that does. It is, instead, social interaction, thinking, definition of the situation that takes place in the present. Our past enters into our actions primarily because we think about it and apply it to the definition of the present situation. \n#Human beings are described as active beings in relation to their environment. Words such as conditioning, responding, controlled, imprisoned, and formed are not used to describe the human being in symbolic interaction. In contrast to other social-scientific perspectives humans are not thought of as being passive in relation to their surroundings, but actively involved in what they do.\"\n\n==Central interactionist themes==\nTo Blumer's conceptual perspective, he put them in three core propositions: that people act toward things, including each other, on the basis of the meanings they have for them; that these meanings are derived through social interaction with others; and that these meanings are managed and transformed through an interpretive process that people use to make sense of and handle the objects that constitute their social worlds. This perspective can also be described as three core principles- Meaning, Language and Thinking- in which social constructs are formed. The principle of meaning is the center of human behavior. Language provides meaning by providing means to symbols. These symbols differentiate social relations of humans from that of animals. By humans giving meaning to symbols, they can express these things with language. In turn, symbols form the basis of communication. Symbols become imperative components for the formation of any kind of communicative act. Thinking then changes the interpretation of individuals as it pertains to symbols.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.colorado.edu/Communications/meta-discourse/Papers/App_Papers/Nelson.htm|title=Herbert Blumer's symbolic interactionism|last=Nelson|first=Lindsey D.|date=1998|website=University of Colorado Boulder|url-status=dead|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref>\n\n=== Snow's Four Principles ===\nKeeping Blumer's earlier work in mind [[David A. Snow]], professor of sociology at the [[University of California, Irvine]], suggests four broader and even more basic orienting principles: [[human agency]], interactive determination, symbolization, and [[emergence]]. Snow uses these four principles as the thematic bases for identifying and discussing contributions to the study of social movements.\n\n# '''Human agency''': emphasizes the active, willful, goal-seeking character of human actors. The emphasis on agency focuses attention on those actions, events, and moments in social life in which agentic action is especially palpable.\n# '''Interactive determination''': specifies that understanding of focal objects of analysis, whether they are self-concepts, identities, roles, practices, or even social movements. Basically this means, neither individual, society, self, or others exist only in relation to each other and therefore can be fully understood only in terms of their interaction.\n# '''Symbolization''''':'' highlights the processes through which events and conditions, artifacts, people, and other environmental features that take on particular meanings, becoming nearly only objects of orientation. Human behavior is partly contingent on what the object of orientation symbolizes or means.\n# '''Emergence''': focuses on attention on the processual and non-habituated side of social life, focusing not only on organization and texture of social life, but also associated meaning and feelings. The principal of emergence tells us not only to possibility of new forms of social life and system meaning but also to transformations in existing forms of social organization.<ref name=\":3\" />\n\n== Applications ==\nSymbolic interaction can be used to explain one's identity in terms of roles being \"ideas and principles on 'what to do' in a given situation,\" as noted by Hewitt.<ref name=\":03\">{{Cite journal|last=|first=|date=2012|title=Symbolic interactionist perspective on linking privacy and identity in social networking sites|url=https://web-b-ebscohost-com.libdata.lib.ua.edu/ehost/pdfviewer/pdfviewer?vid=1&sid=11c6a4ba-2f40-42a8-9384-bba00a780929%40sessionmgr103|journal=International Communication Association|series=Conference Papers|volume=|pages=1\u201327|via=}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book|last=Hewitt|first=J.

Situated identity refers to the ability to view themselves as others do. This is often a snapshot view in that it is short, but can be very impactful. From this experience, one wishes to differentiate themselves from others and the personal identity comes to exist. This view is when one wishes to make themselves known for who they truly are, not the view of others. From the personal identity taking place, comes the social identity where connections and likeness are made with individuals sharing similar identities or identity traits.<ref name=\":03\" />\n\nThis viewpoint of symbolic interactionism can be applied to the use of social networking sites and how one's identity is presented on those sites. With social networking sites, one can boast (or post) their identity through their newsfeed. The personal identity presents itself in the need for individuals to post milestones that one has achieved, in efforts to differentiate themselves. The social identity presents itself when individuals \"tag\" others in their posts, pictures, etc.  <ref name=\":03\" /> Situated identities may be present in the need to defend something on social media or arguments that occur in comments, where one feels it necessary to \"prove\" themselves.\n\nComing from the viewpoint that we learn, or at least desire, how to expect other people's reactions/responses to things, Bruce Link and his colleagues studied how expectations of the reactions of others can affect the mental illness stigma. The participants of the study were individuals with psychosis who answered questions relating to discrimination, stigma, and rejection. The goal of the study was to determine whether others' expectations affect the participants' internalized stigmas, anticipated rejection, concerns with staying in, and other. Results found that high levels of internalized stigma were only present in the minority, however, anticipation of rejection, stigma consciousness, perceived devaluation discrimination and concerns with staying in were found to be more prevalent in participants. These perceptions were correlated with the outcomes of withdrawal, self-esteem and isolation from relatives. The study found that anticipation of rejection played the largest role in internalized stigmas.<ref>Link, Bruce, Jennifer Wells, Jo Phelan, Lawrence Yang. 2015. \"Understanding the importance of 'symbolic interaction stigma': How expectations about the reactions of others adds to the burden of mental illness stigma.\" ''[[Psychiatric Rehabilitation Journal]]'' 38(2):117\u201324.

As a result, people act in their communities according to the meanings they derive about their environment, whether online or offline, from those interactions. This perspective reveals that online communication may very well take on different meanings for different people depending on information, circumstance, relationships, power, and other systems that make up [[communities of practice]]. People enact community the way it is conceived and the meaning of community evolves as they come up with new ways to utilize it. Given this reality, scholars are continually challenged to research and understand how online communities are comprised, how they function, and how they are connected to offline social life.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Fernback|first=Jan|date=February 2007|title=Beyond the diluted community concept: A symbolic interactionist perspective on online social relations|url=https://semanticscholar.org/paper/3ce2c1676e77d3be084222973e5e93c5916d622e|journal=New Media & Society|language=en|volume=9|issue=1|pages=49\u201369|doi=10.1177/1461444807072417|issn=1461-4448|via=}}</ref>\n\nSymbolic interaction theory was discussed in ''The Cyberself: The Self-ing Project goes online, Symbolic Interaction in the Digital Age''.

However, she believes advances in technology have changed this. The article investigates the manner in which individuals form their online identity. She uses symbolic interaction theory to examine the formation of the cyber \"I\" and a digital \"generalized other\". In the article, Robinson suggests individuals form new identities on the internet. She argues these cyber identities are not necessarily the way the individual would be perceived offline.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Robinson|first=Laura|date=February 2007|title=The cyberself: The self-ing project goes online, symbolic interaction in the digital age|url=https://semanticscholar.org/paper/d13b4ae191eb001fb65b1b9767d7db4e710e6435|journal=New Media & Society|language=en|volume=9|issue=1|pages=93\u2013110|doi=10.1177/1461444807072216|issn=1461-4448|via=}}</ref>\n\n==Criticisms==\nSymbolic interactionists are often criticized for being overly impressionistic in their research methods and somewhat unsystematic in their theories. It is argued that the theory is not one theory, but rather, the [[Conceptual framework|''framework'']] for many different theories. Additionally, some theorists have a problem with symbolic interaction theory due to its lack of [[testability]]. These objections, combined with the fairly narrow focus of interactionist research on small-group interactions and other social psychological issues, have relegated the interactionist camp to a minority position among sociologists (albeit a fairly substantial minority). Much of this criticism arose during the 1970s in the U.S. when [[quantitative research|quantitative]] approaches to sociology were dominant, and perhaps the best known of these is by [[Alvin Ward Gouldner|Alvin Gouldner]].<ref>{{Cite book|last=Gouldner|first=Alvin Ward|title=The Coming Crisis of Western Sociology|publisher=Heinemann|year=1971|isbn=978-0435821500|location=London|pages=|oclc=16192914}}</ref>\n\n===Framework and theories===\nSome critiques of symbolic interactionism are based on the assumption that it is a [[theory]], and the critiques apply the criteria for a \"good\" theory to something that does not claim to be a theory. Some critics find the symbolic interactionist framework too broad and general when they are seeking specific theories. Symbolic interactionism is a theoretical ''framework'' rather than a theory{{efn|see: Stryker and Vryan (2006) for a clear distinction between the two as it pertains to [[Interactionism|interactionist]]-inspired conceptualizations.}}<ref>{{cite book|title=Handbook of Social Psychology|last=Stryker|first1=Sheldon|last2=Vryan|first2=Kevin D.|date=January 2006|isbn=978-0-387-32515-6|location=|pages=3\u201328|chapter=The Symbolic Interactionist Frame|doi=10.1007/0-387-36921-X_1|issn=1389-6903|accessdate=2018-09-22|chapter-url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/227124775|series=Handbooks of Sociology and Social Research}}</ref> and can be assessed on the basis of effective conceptualizations. The theoretical framework, as with any theoretical framework, is vague when it comes to analyzing [[empirical data]] or predicting outcomes in social life. As a framework rather than a theory, many scholars find it difficult to use. Interactionism being a framework rather than a theory makes it impossible to test interactionism in the manner that a specific theoretical claim about the relationship between specific variables in a given context allows. Unlike the symbolic interactionist framework, the many theories derived from symbolic interactionism, such as [[role theory]] and the versions of identity theory developed by [[Sheldon Stryker]],<ref name=\":6\">{{Cite journal|last=Stryker|first=Sheldon|date=1968|title=Identity salience and role performance: The relevance of symbolic interaction theory for family research|url=|journal=Journal of Marriage and Family|volume=30|issue=4|pages=558\u201364|doi=10.2307/349494|jstor=349494}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal|last=Stryker|first=Sheldon|date=January 1994|title=Identity theory: Its development, research base, and prospects|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/285539542|journal=Studies in Symbolic Interaction|volume=16|pages=9\u201320|via=ResearchGate}}</ref> as well as Peter Burke and colleagues,<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Burke|first=Peter J.|date=1980|title=The self: Measurement requirements from an interactionist perspective|url=|journal=Social Psychology Quarterly|volume=43|issue=1|pages=18\u201329|doi=10.2307/3033745|jstor=3033745}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal|last=Burke|first=Peter J.|last2=Reitzes|first2=Donald C.|date=1981|title=The link between identity and role performance|url=https://semanticscholar.org/paper/b6a4aa6b219fbd95a5e1a9719a685a9c56843fd4|journal=Social Psychology Quarterly|volume=44|issue=2|pages=83\u201392|doi=10.2307/3033704|jstor=3033704|via=}}</ref> clearly define concepts and the relationships between them in a given context, thus allowing for the opportunity to develop and test hypotheses. Further, especially among Blumerian processual interactionists, a great number of very useful conceptualizations have been developed and applied in a very wide range of social contexts, types of populations, types of behaviors, and cultures and subcultures.\n\n===Social structure===\nSymbolic interactionism is often related and connected with social structure. This concept suggests that symbolic interactionism is a construction of people's social reality.<ref name=\":6\" /> It also implies that from a realistic point of view, the interpretations that are being made will not make much difference. When the reality of a situation is defined, the situation becomes a meaningful reality. This includes methodological criticisms, and critical sociological issues. A number of symbolic interactionists have addressed these topics, the best known being Stryker's structural symbolic interactionism<ref name=\":6\" /><ref>Stryker, Sheldon. 1980. ''Symbolic Interactionism: A Social Structural Version''. Menlo Park, Calif.: [[Benjamin/Cummings Pub. Co.]] [[International Standard Book Number|ISBN]] [[Special:BookSources/9780805391541|9780805391541]]. [[OCLC]] [https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/5707030 5707030].</ref> and the formulations of interactionism heavily influenced by this approach (sometimes referred to as the \"Indiana School\" of symbolic interactionism), including the works of key scholars in sociology and psychology using different methods and theories applying a [[Structuralism|structural]] version of interactionism that are represented in a 2003 collection edited by Burke ''et al''.<ref>Burke, Peter, Timothy J. Owens, Richard T. Serpe, and Peggy  A. Thoits. 2003. ''Advances in Identity Theory and Research''. Boston: [[Springer Publishing|Springer]]. [[International Standard Book Number|ISBN]]&nbsp;[[Special:BookSources/9781441991881|<bdi>9781441991881</bdi>]]. [[OCLC]]&nbsp;[https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/853269009 853269009].</ref> Another well-known structural variation of symbolic interactionism that applies quantitative methods is Manford H. Kuhn's formulation which is often referred to in sociological literature as the \"Iowa School.\" [[Negotiated order|Negotiated order theory]] also applies a structural approach.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Day|first=Robert|last2=Day|first2=JoAnne V.|date=January 1977|title=A review of the current state of negotiated order theory: An appreciation and a critique|url=|journal=The Sociological Quarterly|language=en|volume=18|issue=1|pages=126\u201342|doi=10.1111/j.1533-8525.1977.tb02165.x|issn=0038-0253}}</ref>\n\n==== Language ====\nLanguage is viewed as the source of all meaning.<ref name=\":5\" /> Blumer illuminates several key features about social interactionism. Most people interpret things based on assignment and purpose. The interaction occurs once the meaning of something has become identified. This concept of meaning is what starts to construct the framework of social reality. By aligning social reality, Blumer suggests that language is the meaning of interaction. Communication, especially in the form of symbolic interactionism is connected with language. Language initiates all forms of communication, verbal and non-verbal. Blumer defines this source of meaning as a connection that arises out of the social interaction that people have with each other.\n\n==== Critical perspective ====\nAccording to [[social theorist]] Patricia Burbank, the concepts of synergistic and diverging properties are what shape the viewpoints of humans as social beings. These two concepts are different in a sense because of their views of human freedom and their level of focus. According to Burbank, actions are based on the effects of situations that occur during the process of social interaction. Another important factor in meaningful situations is the environment in which the social interaction occurs. The environment influences interaction, which leads to a reference group and connects with perspective, and then concludes to a definition of the situation. This illustrates the proper steps to define a situation. An approval of the action occurs once the situation is defined. An interpretation is then made upon that action, which may ultimately influence the perspective, action, and definition.\n\nStryker emphasizes that the sociology world at large is the most viable and vibrant intellectual framework.<ref name=\":6\" /> By being made up of our thoughts and self-belief, the social interactionism theory is the purpose of all human interaction, and is what causes society to exist. This fuels criticisms of the symbolic interactionist framework for failing to account for social structure, as well as criticisms that interactionist theories cannot be assessed via [[Quantitative Methods|quantitative methods]], and cannot be [[Falsifiability|falsifiable]] or tested [[Empiricism|empirically]]. Framework is important for the symbolic interaction theory because for in order for the social structure to form, there are certain bonds of communication that need to be established to create the interaction. Much of the symbolic interactionist framework's basic tenets can be found in a very wide range of sociological and psychological work, without being explicitly cited as interactionist, making the influence of symbolic interactionism difficult to recognize given this general acceptance of its assumptions as \"common knowledge.\"\n\nAnother problem with this model is two-fold, in that it 1) does not take into account human emotions very much, implying that symbolic interaction is not completely psychological; and 2) is interested in social structure to a limited extent, implying that symbolic interaction is not completely sociological. These incompetencies frame meaning as something that occurs naturally within an interaction under a certain condition, rather than taking into account the basic social context in which interaction is positioned. From this view, meaning has no source and does not perceive a social reality beyond what humans create with their own interpretations.<ref>Aksan, Nilgun, Buket Kisac, Mufit Aydin, and Sumeyra Demirbuken. 2009. \"Symbolic Interaction Theory.\" ''Procedia \u2013 Social and Behavioral Sciences'' 1(1): 902\u20134. DOI: [[doi:10.1016/j.sbspro.2009.01.160|10.1016/j.sbspro.2009.01.160]].</ref>\n\nAnother criticism of symbolic interactionism is more so on the scholars themselves. They are noted to not take interest in the history of this sociological approach. This has the ability to produce shallow understanding and can make the subject \"hard to teach\" based on the lack of organization in its teachings to relate with other theories or studies. <ref>{{Cite journal|last=Dingwall|first=Robert|date=2001|title=Notes toward an intellectual history of symbolic interaction|url=|journal=Symbolic Interaction|volume=24|issue=2|pages=237\u201342|doi=10.1525/si.2001.24.2.237|jstor=10.1525/si.2001.24.2.237}}</ref>\n\n==Society for the Study of Symbolic Interaction==\nThe Society for the Study of Symbolic Interaction (SSSI)<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://symbolicinteraction.org/|title=About SSSI|date=2020|website=Society for the Study of Symbolic Interaction|url-status=live|access-date=27 March 2020}}</ref> is an international professional organization for scholars, who are interested in the study of symbolic interaction.

Ideology, in his view, is not a deliberate distortion of reality or a fa\u00e7ade for material interests; rather, it is the conceptual lens through which groups of people perceive the world around them.

At a time when social history was ascendant, and cultural history was associated with the study of the arts, taste, and popular culture, and intellectual history with the study of abstract ideas largely divorced from specific social contexts, he called for a history that focused on beliefs, values, fears, aspirations, and emotions.<ref>\u201cSome Recent Directions in American Cultural History,\u201d ''American Historical Review'', Feb. 1968, 696-707.</ref>\n\n''Antebellum American Culture'' (1979), his panoramic look at the cultural discourse surrounding ethnicity, gender, family, race, science, and wealth and power in the pre-Civil War United States, advanced the argument that American culture needs to be understood in terms of an ongoing \u201cmoral civil war.\u201d Diverse groups of Americans debated \u201cwhat was happening, who was doing what to whom, what to fear and what to fight for.\u201d He suggests that a relatively small group of Northeastern writers, preachers, and reformers in the 19th century United States ultimately succeeded in defining a set of middle-class norms regarding education, taste, sex roles, sensibility, and moral respectability.<ref>David Brion Davis, ''Antebellum American Culture: An Interpretive Anthology'' (State College: Pennsylvania State University Press), xxii</ref>\n\n===Study of slavery===\n[[University of Maryland]] historian [[Ira Berlin]] wrote that \u201cno scholar has played a larger role in expanding contemporary understanding of how slavery shaped the history of the United States, the Americas, and the world than David Brion Davis.\u201d<ref>Quoted in Goodman (2006)</ref>  In a series of landmark books, articles, and lectures, Davis moved beyond a view of slavery that focuses on the institution in individual nations to look at the \u201cbig picture,\u201d the multinational view of the origins, development, and abolition of New World slavery.<ref>Davis, David Brion.

Ideology, in his view, is not a deliberate distortion of reality or a fa\u00e7ade for material interests; rather, it is the conceptual lens through which groups of people perceive the world around them.

At a time when social history was ascendant, and cultural history was associated with the study of the arts, taste, and popular culture, and intellectual history with the study of abstract ideas largely divorced from specific social contexts, he called for a history that focused on beliefs, values, fears, aspirations, and emotions.<ref>\u201cSome Recent Directions in American Cultural History,\u201d ''American Historical Review'', Feb. 1968, 696-707.</ref>\n\n''Antebellum American Culture'' (1979), his panoramic look at the cultural discourse surrounding ethnicity, gender, family, race, science, and wealth and power in the pre-Civil War United States, advanced the argument that American culture needs to be understood in terms of an ongoing \u201cmoral civil war.\u201d Diverse groups of Americans debated \u201cwhat was happening, who was doing what to whom, what to fear and what to fight for.\u201d He suggests that a relatively small group of Northeastern writers, preachers, and reformers in the 19th century United States ultimately succeeded in defining a set of middle-class norms regarding education, taste, sex roles, sensibility, and moral respectability.<ref>David Brion Davis, ''Antebellum American Culture: An Interpretive Anthology'' (State College: Pennsylvania State University Press), xxii</ref>\n\n===Study of slavery===\n[[University of Maryland]] historian [[Ira Berlin]] wrote that \u201cno scholar has played a larger role in expanding contemporary understanding of how slavery shaped the history of the United States, the Americas, and the world than David Brion Davis.\u201d<ref>Quoted in Goodman (2006)</ref>  In a series of landmark books, articles, and lectures, Davis moved beyond a view of slavery that focuses on the institution in individual nations to look at the \u201cbig picture,\u201d the multinational view of the origins, development, and abolition of New World slavery.<ref>Davis, David Brion.

The 2nd Earl was murdered by [[George Gordon, 1st Marquess of Huntly|George Gordon, Earl of Huntly]], as the culmination of a vendetta. Known as \"the Bonnie Earl\" for his good looks, he became the subject of a popular ballad, ''[[The Bonnie Earl of Moray]]''.\n\n==Life==\nHe was the eldest son of [[James Stewart, 1st Lord Doune|James Stewart]], and was a male-line descendant of [[Robert II of Scotland]]'s second son, the [[Robert Stewart, Duke of Albany|Duke of Albany]], through an [[James \"Beg\" Stewart|illegitimate line]]. His father was created Lord Doune on 24 November 1581. From his distant relative [[James VI and I|King James VI]], he received in the year 1580 a gift of the ward and marriage of the two daughters of the [[James Stewart, 1st Earl of Moray|Regent Moray]]. In January 1581 he married [[Elizabeth Stuart, 2nd Countess of Moray|Elizabeth Stewart]], the elder daughter. The wedding was celebrated on 31 January in Fife with a tournament of \"running at the ring\" and [[James VI of Scotland]] took part. Two day after the party came to Leith, where a water pageant culminated with a theatrical assault on a Papal [[Castel Sant'Angelo]], built on boats on the [[water of Leith]] Some of her relatives thought the Lord Doune's son was not of sufficient status to marry her.<ref>''Calendar State Papers Scotland: 1574-1581'', vol. 5 (Edinburgh, 1907), p. 611.</ref> He soon after assumed, ''[[jure uxoris]]'', the title of the [[Earl of Moray]]. Stewart held the office of Collector General, receiving income from the church.\n\nStewart was an extremely ambitious man who aimed to make himself the most powerful lord in the north-east at the expense of his neighbour, the Earl of Huntly. On 1 August 1588 he was appointed a commissioner for executing the act against the [[Spanish armada]], and on 5 March 1590 was commissioned to execute the acts against the [[Jesuits]]. He then foolishly entered into an alliance with his wife's famous cousin [[Francis Stewart, 5th Earl of Bothwell]] who was a notorious conspirator greatly feared by the King. In late 1590 he decided, along with the [[Earl of Atholl]], to assist the [[Laird]] of [[Clan Grant|Grant]] when his house was being besieged by Huntly; Huntly retreated to [[Edinburgh]] and on 23 January 1591 presented a supplication against Moray for his \"having taken part with the malefactors in the north\", both earls were then commanded to proceed to Edinburgh and sign bands to keep the peace.\n\nHuntly then obtained a special commission to pursue Bothwell and his associates, whom the King feared were planning a rebellion. To prevent Bothwell from obtaining shelter with the Earl of Moray, a distant cousin and ally, Moray was induced by [[Lord Ochiltree]], who was specially deputed by the King, to come south on the condition of receiving a [[pardon]]. It is claimed in the traditional ballad that James was jealous of Moray's favour with his Queen, [[Anne of Denmark]], on account of his good looks. Moray, in expectation of a summons to the court, had arrived at [[Donibristle]], a house of his mother on the [[Fife]] coast, when on 7 February 1592 it was suddenly beset by the followers of Huntly, who called on him to surrender. He declined to do so, and Huntly set fire to the house. Moray stayed for a time inside, and, suddenly dashing out, he broke through the cordon surrounding the house, and made for the rocks on the seashore. The glow of his burning helmet tassle, however, was said to have betrayed his location and he was killed. The corpses of the earl and of Dunbar, Sheriff of Moray, who was also killed, were brought by the earl's mother to [[Leith]] to be placed in the tomb of the Regent Moray in the Church of St. Giles; but for some months they remained in their coffins unburied, their friends refusing to bury them until the killing was punished. Captain Gordon, one of Huntly's followers, who being wounded was unable to escape to the north, was brought to Edinburgh and executed; but this was not enough to satisfy popular feeling, and the King deemed it prudent to retire from Edinburgh to Glasgow, until Huntly entered himself in ward in [[Blackness Castle]]. This Huntly did on 12 March, but on the 20th he was released on giving surety that on six days' notice he would appear and stand his trial whenever called on to do so. This murder remains famous to this day as the earl was just 27 years old at the time of his death and his murderer's punishment was a mere week-long house arrest.\n\n==Family==\nBy his wife, Elizabeth Stewart, whom he married between 23 January 1580 and 1581 and who died three months before he did, he had two sons and three daughters:\n* Lady Grizel Stuart, married Sir Robert Innes, 1st Baronet Innes, by whom she had issue.<ref>''Ane Account of the Familie of Innes'' (Aberdeen, 1864), pp. 43-4.</ref> \n* [[Margaret Howard, Countess of Nottingham|Lady Margaret Stuart]] (1591- 4 August 1639), married firstly, as his second wife, [[Charles Howard, 1st Earl of Nottingham]], by whom she had issue; and secondly [[William Monson, Viscount Monson]]\n* [[James Stuart, 3rd Earl of Moray]] (before 1591- 6 August 1638), married Lady Anne Gordon, by whom he had issue, including [[James Stuart, 4th Earl of Moray]]\n* Lady Elizabeth Stuart, married John Abernathy, 8th Lord Abernathy of Saltoun\n* [[Francis Stuart (sailor)|Sir Francis Stewart]], [[Knight]] of the [[Order of the Bath]], who was well known in London literary society, and is said to have frequented the literary meetings at the Mermaid tavern\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n;Attribution\n{{DNB|wstitle=Stewart, James (d.1592)}}\n\n==Further reading==\n{{commons category}}\n*Potter, Harry, Bloodfeud: The Morays and Gordons at War in the Age of Mary Queen of Scots (Tempus, 2004), the definitive account.\n\n{{S-start}}\n{{s-reg|sct}}\n{{succession box | title=[[Earl of Moray]] | before=[[Elizabeth Stewart, 2nd Countess of Moray|Elizabeth Stewart]] | after=[[James Stuart, 3rd Earl of Moray|James Stuart]] | years=}}\n{{S-end}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Moray, James Stewart, 2nd Earl Of}}\n[[Category:House of Stuart|James, 2nd Earl of Moray]]\n[[Category:1592 deaths]]\n[[Category:Earls of Moray]]\n[[Category:Scottish murder victims]]\n[[Category:Year of birth uncertain]]\n[[Category:16th-century Scottish peers]]\n[[Category:Court of James VI and I]]\n", "text_old": "{{Use dmy dates|date=October 2019}}\n[[File:James Stewart, 2nd Earl of Moray.jpg|thumb|right|James Stewart, 2nd Earl of Moray.
