[[Tyrone Power]] stars as the scrappy Irish immigrant whose 50-year career at [[United States Military Academy|West Point]] took him from a [[Dishwashing|dishwasher]] to a [[non-commissioned officer]] and athletic instructor. Maher was buried there in January 1961.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.irish-society.org/home/hedgemaster-archives-2/people/maher-marty|title=irish-society|website=irish-society|accessdate=31 May 2017}}</ref>\n\n[[Maureen O'Hara]], one of [[John Ford|Ford's]] favorite leading ladies, plays Maher's wife and fellow [[Immigration|immigrant]], Mary O'Donnell. The film co-stars [[Ward Bond]] as [[Herman Koehler]], the Master of the Sword (athletic director) and Army's head football coach (1897\u20131900), who first befriends Maher. [[Milburn Stone]] appears as [[John J. Pershing]], who in 1898 swears Maher into the Army. [[Harry Carey, Jr.]], makes a brief appearance as the young cadet [[Dwight D. Eisenhower]]. [[Philip Carey]] plays (fictional) Army football player and future general Chuck Dotson. In addition, actress [[Betsy Palmer]] makes her screen debut as Kitty Carter.\n\nThe phrase \"The Long Gray Line\" is used to describe, as a continuum, all graduates and cadets of the [[United States Military Academy]] at [[West Point]], New York. Many of the scenes in the film were shot on location at West Point, including the \"million dollar view\" of the [[Hudson River]] near the parade grounds. The film was the last one in which actor [[Robert Francis (actor)|Robert Francis]] appeared before his death at age 25 in an air crash. His rising stardom had reached third billing behind Power and O'Hara at the time of his death.\n\n==Plot==\nThe movie is framed as the reminiscences of Master Sergeant Martin Maher ([[Tyrone Power]]), who first came to West Point in 1898 as a civilian employee. Arriving from [[County Tipperary]], Ireland, Marty begins as a waiter. When he realizes that enlisted men receive better treatment than do hired laborers, he immediately signs up and joins the U.S. Army. Capt. Koehler ([[Ward Bond]]), impressed with his boxing skills, wants him as an assistant in athletics instruction.\n\nMarty meets Mrs. Koehler's cook, Mary O'Donnell ([[Maureen O'Hara]]), also recently arrived from Ireland. They marry and settle into a house on campus. Marty becomes a corporal, and Mary saves enough money to bring his father ([[Donald Crisp]]) and brother ([[Sean McClory]]) to America. Mary becomes pregnant, but the baby dies only hours after birth, and Mary learns that she may never have another child. The cadets become the children they will never have. Over time, Marty continues to earn the love and respect of cadets such as [[Omar Bradley]], [[James Van Fleet]], [[George Patton]] and [[Dwight D. Eisenhower]]. The Mahers grow close to the family of \"Red\" Sundstrom, a West Point cadet killed in World War I.\n\nYears later, Marty is still at West Point, and James \"Red\" Sundstrom, Jr. ([[Robert Francis (actor)|Robert Francis]]), along with the sons of others whom Marty had trained, has become a cadet. At the outbreak of World War II Sundstrom confesses to Marty that he has illegally married his girlfriend which could disqualify him from graduating. Although his marriage is annulled, Sundstrom resigns from West Point to join the regular U.S. Army. Later, Mary attempts to view one of the parades she so loves but her poor health forces her to watch from her porch. She quietly dies while Marty is fetching her shawl. On Christmas Eve, Marty prepares for quiet evening but is joined by a group of cadets. Kitty ([[Betsy Palmer]]) arrives with Red, Jr., who has earned his captain's bars in [[Western Front (World War II)|Europe]] and wants Marty to pin them on.\n\nAfter Marty is faced with retirement, he heads to Washington to see the President (a West Point graduate) about the matter. He is met by the Superintendent of the United States Military Academy along with several high-ranking officers on his return to West Point. Slightly bemused by the attention, he is taken to the parade field. The film concludes with a full dress parade in Marty's honor. As the band plays a series of Irish tunes, all the people Marty loves, both living and dead, join the parade to honor him.<ref name=tcm>{{cite web|url=http://www.tcm.com/tcmdb/title/81751/The-Long-Gray-Line/|title=The Long Gray Line (1955) - Overview - TCM.com|website=Turner Classic Movies|accessdate=31 May 2017}}</ref>\n\n==Cast==\n{{div col}}\n*[[Tyrone Power]] as [[Martin Maher (soldier)|Martin Maher]]\n*[[Maureen O'Hara]] as Mary O'Donnell\n*[[Robert Francis (actor)|Robert Francis]] as James N.

{"title_page": "SS Columbia Eagle incident", "text_new": "{{DISPLAYTITLE:SS ''Columbia Eagle'' incident}}\nThe '''SS ''Columbia Eagle'' incident''' refers to a [[mutiny]] that occurred aboard the U.S. flagged merchant vessel ''Columbia Eagle'' in March 1970 when two crewmembers seized the vessel with the threat of a bomb and handgun, and forced the master to sail to [[Cambodia]]. The ship was under contract with the [[Military Sea Transportation Service]] to carry [[napalm]] bombs to be used by the [[U.S. Air Force]] during the Vietnam War and was originally bound for [[Sattahip]], [[Thailand]]. During the mutiny, 24 of the crew were forced into two lifeboats and set adrift in the [[Gulf of Thailand]] while the remainder of the crew were forced to take the ship to a bay near [[Sihanoukville (city)|Sihanoukville]], Cambodia. The two mutineers requested political asylum from the Cambodian government which was initially granted but they were later arrested and jailed. ''Columbia Eagle'' was returned to U.S. control in April 1970.

She was designed to carry all types of dry supplies and munitions to Pacific theaters of World War II. SS ''Pierre Victory'' survived three separate [[kamikaze]] attacks by the Japanese in 1945.<ref>[https://www.sdhspress.com/blog/naval-ships-and-a-land-locked-state ''Pierre Victory'' and landlock state, 14 February 2019]</ref> After World War II the ''Pierre Victory'' was converted to a [[livestock]] ship, also called a [[Seagoing cowboys]] ship. ''Pierre Victory'' made 6 trips with 780 horses on each trip to war torn [[Poland]] and [[Greece]].<ref>[https://www.heifer.org/ Heifer International]</ref><ref>[https://seagoingcowboys.com/seagoing-cowboys/cowboy-stories/ Sea going cowboys]</ref><ref>[https://seagoingcowboyswebsite.files.wordpress.com/2015/11/about_unrrareport_withlosses.pdf Seacowboys report]</ref><ref>[https://northerncatskillshistory.com/ArticlesHTML/0301CHS%20Cowboys/0301CHS%20Cowboys.pdf Who were the Seagoing Cowboys, by Jackie Turnquist]</ref><ref>[https://seagoingcowboysblog.wordpress.com/tag/s-s-pierre-victory/ Seagoing Cowboys, S.

Like most of the ships of the Victory-type, ''Pierre Victory'' was decommissioned after the war then sold to commercial shipping company. In 1968, she was purchased by the Columbia Steamship Company, renamed ''Columbia Eagle'' and contracted out to the Military Sea Transportation Service for the purpose of hauling supplies and ammunition to Southeast Asian ports in South Vietnam and Thailand during the Vietnam War.<ref name=Linnett67>Linnett, pp 67\u201368</ref> Because ''Columbia Eagle'' was a U.S. flagged ship, she was a part of the [[Merchant Marine]] fleet and therefore eligible under government contracting rules to haul military supplies to the war zone.<ref name=Cutler142>Cutler, p 142</ref>\n\n==History==\n\n===Clyde William McKay, Jr.===\nClyde McKay was born on 20 May 1944 near [[Hemet, California]]. His father was in the military at the time and often had duty away from the family. While a teenager, he suffered a misdiagnosed bowel obstruction and was seriously ill for a year. Because of this, he lost a year in school and never finished high school and decided to join the merchant marine. McKay received his [[Merchant Mariner's Document|merchant marine documents]] on 23 October 1963 and joined the [[Seafarers International Union]] shortly thereafter.<ref name=Linnett13>Linnett, pp 13\u201315</ref>\n\n===Alvin Leonard Glatkowski===\nAlvin Glatkowski was born on 11 September 1949 at [[Augusta, Georgia]]. His father was also in the military at the time of his birth but shortly after Glatkowski was born, his father abandoned the family. His mother married a Navy third-class machinist mate named Ralph Hagan when Glatkowski was three. Hagan was abusive to Glatkowski when he was home, but was often on duty or cruises and Glatkowski learned to be independent at an early age. As a teenager, Glatkowski assumed the role of head of the household when Hagan was at sea and this made Hagan very angry when he returned home. He often took out his frustrations on Glatkowski violently, which led him to leave home at eighteen. Glatkowski went to New York and enrolled in the [[Seafarers Harry Lundeberg School of Seamanship]] operated by the [[Seafarers International Union]]. Lundeberg School taught the skills needed to get deck, engine and steward jobs on merchant marine ships. On 17 April 1967, Glatkowski received his merchant mariner papers stating he was eligible for entry-level jobs on U.S. flagged ships.<ref name=Linnett43>Linnett, pp 43\u201356</ref>\n\n===Mutiny===\nOn 14 March 1970, McKay and Glatkowski used guns they had smuggled aboard to seize control of their ship, SS ''Columbia Eagle'', in the first armed [[mutiny]] aboard an American ship in 150 years.  The ship had been sailing on a [[United States Department of Defense|Department of Defense]] supply charter carrying [[Napalm]] to the [[U.S. Air Force]] bases in [[Thailand]] for use in the [[Vietnam War]].\n\nThe mutineers claimed that there was a live bomb on board the ship, and forced the captain to order 24 of the crewmen to abandon ship in the lifeboats.  The ship's cargo, 3,500 500-pound bombs and 1,225 750-pound bombs, gave this threat credibility.\n\nWhen the crewmen departed in lifeboats, an [[SOS]] was transmitted. A [[Lockheed P-3 Orion|Lockheed P-3B]] from [[VP-1]] operating from [[U-Tapao Royal Thai Navy Airfield]], Thailand, were directed to launch a [[search and rescue]] (SAR) mission to find the SS ''Columbia Eagle'' and assist as needed.  Upon arrival at the ship, they found a small crew and the presence of small arms, they immediately reported the hijacking and their assessment that the ship was heading for Cambodia. Communications and status reporting was maintained until they were relieved. Other P-3 Orion aircrews kept the ''Columbia Eagle'' under constant surveillance.\n\nThe merchant ship ''Rappahanock'' picked up the lifeboats and crew members and broadcast the news of the mutiny.  The [[United States Coast Guard]] cutter {{USCGC|Mellon|WHEC-717|2}} was the first US military vessel to pursue the ''Columbia Eagle''.  The [[amphibious transport dock]] {{USS|Denver|LPD-9|6}} was diverted to relieve ''Mellon'' in its pursuit.  The destroyer, {{USS|Turner Joy|DD-951|6}}, was detached from station at I Corps to pursue the ''Columbia Eagle'' at flank speed and to intervene. However, the ''Columbia Eagle'' reached Cambodian waters before any U.S. naval ships could intercept.<ref name=\"NHHC2\">{{cite web|title=1970 Command History of USS ''Denver'' (LPD-9)|url=http://www.history.navy.mil/shiphist/d/lpd-9/1970.pdf|work=Command Operations Reports|publisher=US Navy Naval History and Heritage Command|pages=2\u20133|format=pdf|accessdate=31 May 2013}}{{dead link|date=May 2017}}</ref>\n\nWith only 13 crewmen remaining aboard besides the mutineers, they sailed into Cambodian waters, where they assumed they would be welcomed as heroes. They anchored within the {{convert|12|mi}} territorial limit claimed by Cambodia on the afternoon of 15 March.\n\nAt 09:51 on 16 March, ''Denver'' anchored {{convert|15.6|mi}} from the coast in the [[Gulf of Siam]], remaining outside Cambodian waters.  ''Mellon'' joined shortly thereafter with Commander, Amphibious Squadron Seven, as the senior officer present.  Two [[CH-53 Sea Stallion]] helicopters landed on ''Denver'' from bases in [[South Vietnam]] to assist in visual surveillance.  Meanwhile, the mutineers had turned the ship over to Cambodia's Prince [[Norodom Sihanouk]]'s government, declared themselves anti-war revolutionaries, and were granted asylum.<ref name=\"NHHC2\" />\n\nOn 17 March, the helicopters were detached and ''Denver'', with Commander, Amphibious Squadron Seven, departed for [[Singapore]], passing on-scene command to ''Mellon''.<ref name=\"NHHC2\" />\n''Turner Joy'' remained on station in a cruising pattern within shipping lanes and in sight of the harbor channel.\n\nOn 18 March at 06:36, ''Denver'' reversed her course; Prince Sihanouk had been [[Cambodian coup of 1970|deposed by a coup]] led by the pro-U.S. [[Sirik Matak]] and [[Lon Nol]]. If the Cambodians could be persuaded to release ''Columbia Eagle'', ''Denver'''s flight deck could help the rescued crew members rejoin their ship. The coup was unfortunate for mutineers, McKay and Glatkowski; as they had hoped to find asylum in a pro-Communist country; instead, they became prisoners of the new Cambodian government.

The ship was under contract with the [[Military Sea Transportation Service]] to carry [[napalm]] bombs to be used by the [[U.S. Air Force]] during the Vietnam War and was originally bound for [[Sattahip]], [[Thailand]]. During the mutiny, 24 of the crew were forced into two lifeboats and set adrift in the [[Gulf of Thailand]] while the remainder of the crew were forced to take the ship to a bay near [[Sihanoukville (city)|Sihanoukville]], Cambodia. The two mutineers requested political asylum from the Cambodian government which was initially granted but they were later arrested and jailed. ''Columbia Eagle'' was returned to U.S. control in April 1970.

She was designed to carry all types of dry supplies and munitions to Pacific theaters of World War II. SS ''Pierre Victory'' survived three separate [[kamikaze]] attacks by the Japanese in 1945.<ref>[https://www.sdhspress.com/blog/naval-ships-and-a-land-locked-state ''Pierre Victory'' and landlock state, 14 February 2019]</ref> After World War II the ''Pierre Victory'' was converted to a [[livestock]] ship, also called a [[Seagoing cowboys]] ship.

Like most of the ships of the Victory-type, ''Pierre Victory'' was decommissioned after the war then sold to commercial shipping company. In 1968, she was purchased by the Columbia Steamship Company, renamed ''Columbia Eagle'' and contracted out to the Military Sea Transportation Service for the purpose of hauling supplies and ammunition to Southeast Asian ports in South Vietnam and Thailand during the Vietnam War.<ref name=Linnett67>Linnett, pp 67\u201368</ref> Because ''Columbia Eagle'' was a U.S. flagged ship, she was a part of the [[Merchant Marine]] fleet and therefore eligible under government contracting rules to haul military supplies to the war zone.<ref name=Cutler142>Cutler, p 142</ref>\n\n==History==\n\n===Clyde William McKay, Jr.===\nClyde McKay was born on 20 May 1944 near [[Hemet, California]]. His father was in the military at the time and often had duty away from the family. While a teenager, he suffered a misdiagnosed bowel obstruction and was seriously ill for a year. Because of this, he lost a year in school and never finished high school and decided to join the merchant marine. McKay received his [[Merchant Mariner's Document|merchant marine documents]] on 23 October 1963 and joined the [[Seafarers International Union]] shortly thereafter.<ref name=Linnett13>Linnett, pp 13\u201315</ref>\n\n===Alvin Leonard Glatkowski===\nAlvin Glatkowski was born on 11 September 1949 at [[Augusta, Georgia]]. His father was also in the military at the time of his birth but shortly after Glatkowski was born, his father abandoned the family. His mother married a Navy third-class machinist mate named Ralph Hagan when Glatkowski was three. Hagan was abusive to Glatkowski when he was home, but was often on duty or cruises and Glatkowski learned to be independent at an early age. As a teenager, Glatkowski assumed the role of head of the household when Hagan was at sea and this made Hagan very angry when he returned home. He often took out his frustrations on Glatkowski violently, which led him to leave home at eighteen. Glatkowski went to New York and enrolled in the [[Seafarers Harry Lundeberg School of Seamanship]] operated by the [[Seafarers International Union]]. Lundeberg School taught the skills needed to get deck, engine and steward jobs on merchant marine ships. On 17 April 1967, Glatkowski received his merchant mariner papers stating he was eligible for entry-level jobs on U.S. flagged ships.<ref name=Linnett43>Linnett, pp 43\u201356</ref>\n\n===Mutiny===\nOn 14 March 1970, McKay and Glatkowski used guns they had smuggled aboard to seize control of their ship, SS ''Columbia Eagle'', in the first armed [[mutiny]] aboard an American ship in 150 years.  The ship had been sailing on a [[United States Department of Defense|Department of Defense]] supply charter carrying [[Napalm]] to the [[U.S. Air Force]] bases in [[Thailand]] for use in the [[Vietnam War]].\n\nThe mutineers claimed that there was a live bomb on board the ship, and forced the captain to order 24 of the crewmen to abandon ship in the lifeboats.  The ship's cargo, 3,500 500-pound bombs and 1,225 750-pound bombs, gave this threat credibility.\n\nWhen the crewmen departed in lifeboats, a [[SOS]] was transmitted. A [[Lockheed P-3 Orion|Lockheed P-3B]] from [[VP-1]] operating from [[U-Tapao Royal Thai Navy Airfield]], Thailand, were directed to launch a [[search and rescue]] (SAR) mission to find the SS ''Columbia Eagle'' and assist as needed.  Upon arrival at the ship, they found a small crew and the presence of small arms, they immediately reported the hijacking and their assessment that the ship was heading for Cambodia. Communications and status reporting was maintained until they were relieved. Other P-3 Orion aircrews kept the ''Columbia Eagle'' under constant surveillance.\n\nThe merchant ship ''Rappahanock'' picked up the lifeboats and crew members and broadcast the news of the mutiny.  The [[United States Coast Guard]] cutter {{USCGC|Mellon|WHEC-717|2}} was the first US military vessel to pursue the ''Columbia Eagle''.  The [[amphibious transport dock]] {{USS|Denver|LPD-9|6}} was diverted to relieve ''Mellon'' in its pursuit.  The destroyer, {{USS|Turner Joy|DD-951|6}}, was detached from station at I Corps to pursue the ''Columbia Eagle'' at flank speed and to intervene. However, the ''Columbia Eagle'' reached Cambodian waters before any U.S. naval ships could intercept.<ref name=\"NHHC2\">{{cite web|title=1970 Command History of USS ''Denver'' (LPD-9)|url=http://www.history.navy.mil/shiphist/d/lpd-9/1970.pdf|work=Command Operations Reports|publisher=US Navy Naval History and Heritage Command|pages=2\u20133|format=pdf|accessdate=31 May 2013}}{{dead link|date=May 2017}}</ref>\n\nWith only 13 crewmen remaining aboard besides the mutineers, they sailed into Cambodian waters, where they assumed they would be welcomed as heroes. They anchored within the {{convert|12|mi}} territorial limit claimed by Cambodia on the afternoon of 15 March.\n\nAt 09:51 on 16 March, ''Denver'' anchored {{convert|15.6|mi}} from the coast in the [[Gulf of Siam]], remaining outside Cambodian waters.  ''Mellon'' joined shortly thereafter with Commander, Amphibious Squadron Seven, as the senior officer present.  Two [[CH-53 Sea Stallion]] helicopters landed on ''Denver'' from bases in [[South Vietnam]] to assist in visual surveillance.  Meanwhile, the mutineers had turned the ship over to Cambodia's Prince [[Norodom Sihanouk]]'s government, declared themselves anti-war revolutionaries, and were granted asylum.<ref name=\"NHHC2\" />\n\nOn 17 March, the helicopters were detached and ''Denver'', with Commander, Amphibious Squadron Seven, departed for [[Singapore]], passing on-scene command to ''Mellon''.<ref name=\"NHHC2\" />\n''Turner Joy'' remained on station in a cruising pattern within shipping lanes and in sight of the harbor channel.\n\nOn 18 March at 06:36, ''Denver'' reversed her course; Prince Sihanouk had been [[Cambodian coup of 1970|deposed by a coup]] led by the pro-U.S. [[Sirik Matak]] and [[Lon Nol]]. If the Cambodians could be persuaded to release ''Columbia Eagle'', ''Denver'''s flight deck could help the rescued crew members rejoin their ship. The coup was unfortunate for mutineers, McKay and Glatkowski; as they had hoped to find asylum in a pro-Communist country; instead, they became prisoners of the new Cambodian government.  At 23:59 on 18 March, ''Denver'' anchored in the Gulf of Siam {{convert|17|mi}} from the coast of Cambodia.<ref name=\"NHHC2\" />\n\nSihanouk, now in exile, charged that the CIA had masterminded the mutiny to deliver weapons to Lon Nol.
