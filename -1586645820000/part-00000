It is Cartoon Network's first animated series to be created solely by a woman. It is the [[coming-of-age story]] of a young boy, [[Steven Universe (character)|Steven Universe]] (voiced by [[Zach Callison]]), who lives with the Crystal Gems\u2014magical, humanoid aliens named [[Garnet (Steven Universe)|Garnet]] ([[Estelle (musician)|Estelle]]), [[Amethyst (Steven Universe)|Amethyst]] ([[Michaela Dietz]]), and [[Pearl (Steven Universe)|Pearl]] ([[Deedee Magno Hall]])\u2014in the fictional town of Beach City. Steven, who is half-Gem, has adventures with his friends and helps the Gems protect the world from their own kind. Its pilot was first shown on May 21, 2013, and the series premiered on November 4, 2013. Its fifth and final season concluded in January 2019. The TV film ''[[Steven Universe: The Movie]]'' was released on September 2, 2019, and an epilogue [[Limited series (television)|limited series]], ''[[Steven Universe Future]]'', premiered on December 7, 2019 and ended on March 27, 2020.\n\nThe themes of the series include love, family, and the importance of healthy interpersonal relationships. Sugar based the lead character on her younger brother Steven, who is an artist for the series. She developed ''Steven Universe'' while she was a writer and storyboard artist on ''[[Adventure Time]]'', which she left when Cartoon Network commissioned her series for full production. The series is storyboard-driven; when episodes are being produced the show's storyboard artists are responsible for writing the dialogue and creating the action. Books, comics and video games based on the series have been released. \n\nThe series has developed a broad fan base and has been critically acclaimed for its design, music, voice acting, characterization, prominence of [[LGBT|LGBTQ]] themes and [[science fantasy]] worldbuilding.

The Gems are ageless alien warriors who project female humanoid forms from magical gemstones at the core of their being. The Crystal Gems comprise Garnet, Amethyst, Pearl and Steven\u2014a young, half-human, half-Gem boy who inherited his gemstone from his mother, the Crystal Gems' former leader Rose Quartz. As Steven tries to understand his gradually expanding range of powers, he spends his days with his father Greg, his best friend Connie, his magical pet lion, other residents of Beach City, and the Gems. He explores the abilities inherited from his mother, which include fusion\u2014the ability of Gems to merge their bodies and abilities to form new, more powerful personalities.\n\nThe series's first season gradually reveals that the Crystal Gems are remnants of a great interstellar empire. During their missions they visit ruins that were once important to Gem culture but have been derelict for millennia. The Gems are cut off from the Gem homeworld, and Steven learns that many of the monsters and artifacts they encounter are Gems who were corrupted by a Gem weapon of mass destruction and can no longer maintain rational, humanoid form. By the end of the first season, Steven learns that, millennia ago, the Gem empire intended to sterilize the Earth to incubate new Gems, but Rose Quartz led her supporters, the Crystal Gems, in a violent and apparently successful rebellion against this genocidal plan. The discovery and release of Lapis Lazuli, a Gem trapped on Earth for millennia, puts the Crystal Gems at risk from the Gem empire once more, leading to the arrival of hostile envoys Peridot and Jasper.\n\nIn the second season, Peridot allies with and eventually joins the Crystal Gems to prevent Earth's destruction by a Gem \"geo-weapon\" buried in the planet. During the third season, Lapis Lazuli decides to live on Earth with Peridot; Jasper is defeated and captured; and Steven learns that his mother assassinated one of the Gem empire's matriarchs, Pink Diamond. In the fourth season, as Steven wrestles with his conflicted feelings about his mother's actions, the Gem empire leaders Blue Diamond and Yellow Diamond begin to turn their full attention to Earth. In the fifth and final season, Steven learns that in fact his mother ''was'' Pink Diamond, who faked her death to assume the identity of Rose Quartz; he uses this revelation to persuade the other Diamonds to try to take responsibility for and fix the damage they have caused.\n\n==Conception==\n[[File:Rebecca Sugar Speaking at New York Comic Con 2014 - Peter Dzubay (cropped).jpeg|thumb|upright|alt=Rebecca Sugar, a smiling, bespectacled young woman|Rebecca Sugar (creator of ''Steven Universe'') is the first woman to create a show for Cartoon Network.]]\nIn 2011, after former Cartoon Network vice-president of comedy animation Curtis Lelash asked the staff for ideas for a new series, Rebecca Sugar\u2014an artist working for the network's series ''[[Adventure Time]]''\u2014described her initial ideas for what would become ''Steven Universe'', and the project was chosen for development. While developing her show, Sugar continued working on ''Adventure Time''.<ref>{{harvnb|McDonnell|2017|p=19}}</ref> The series evolved from a short story written by Sugar entitled \"Ballad of Margo and Dread\", about a sensitive child helping teenagers with problems they cannot verbalize.<ref>{{harvnb|McDonnell|2017|p=14}}</ref>\n\nCartoon Network executives commissioned the show after the crew's art presentation and Sugar became the first woman to create a show independently for the network.<ref name=\":8\">{{harvnb|McDonnell|2017|p=25}}</ref> Before a production team had been appointed, Sugar tried to alter elements of the show's plot and developed the character's identity so her crew would have the freedom she did when she worked for ''Adventure Time''.<ref name=\":3\">{{harvnb|McDonnell|2017|p=43}}</ref>\n\n=== Development ===\nWhen Sugar's show was commissioned, she resigned from her role as a storyboard artist on ''Adventure Time'' to focus on her own series.<ref name=\":3\" /> Sugar focused the pilot short on the main characters and their personalities to demonstrate the series' humor. The pilot is a [[Slice of life|slice-of-life]] episode that does not involve major events because the series' world was still in development.<ref name=\":0\" /> Sugar and her production team focused the plot on interaction between the Crystal Gems and Steven.<ref>{{harvnb|McDonnell|2017|pp=24\u201325}}</ref> Sugar strove to make her pilot distinctive in terms of its artistic and aesthetic detail but the time limit imposed upon her by Cartoon Network hampered her.

Her brother had no problem with it and trusted Sugar to use his name wisely.<ref name=\":4\" /> In an interview with the ''[[The New York Times|New York Times]],'' Sugar discussed developing the background of the show's protagonist, saying she wanted to base the character's viewpoint on her brother growing up \"where you're so comfortable in your life because you get all the attention, but you also want to rise up and not be the little brother\".<ref name=\"Ito 2013-07-26\">{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2013/07/28/movies/rising-animators-spring-into-motion.html|title=Rising Animators Spring Into Motion|last=Ito|first=Robert|date=July 26, 2013|work=New York Times|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130803055430/http://www.nytimes.com/2013/07/28/movies/rising-animators-spring-into-motion.html|archivedate=August 3, 2013|url-status=live|author2=Jeremy Egner|df=}}</ref>\n\nWhen the original pilot was presented to Cartoon Network executives, they told the crew the series would air in 2013.<ref name=\":8\" /> Cartoon Network released the original pilot in May 2013. Sugar and her team panicked because the series was going to be very different from the pilot episode. The pilot was popular when it was released, engendering forum discussions in which people expressed their hopes of seeing it on the air soon. Those who knew Rebecca Sugar from ''Adventure Time'' were also interested. Positive reaction to the show reassured its crew.<ref name=\":9\">{{harvnb|McDonnell|2017|p=77}}</ref>\n\nTo prepare for the show's commissioning by Cartoon Network, Sugar began assembling a production crew.<ref name=\":3\" /> Jackie Buscarino was engaged as a producer in September 2012 and was tasked with hiring people and supervising the show's crew.<ref name=\":5\">{{harvnb|McDonnell|2017|p=48}}</ref> During this period of development, Sugar and her team were moved to a building behind the main Cartoon Network studio and based on the same floor as the crew of ''[[The Powerpuff Girls]]'' CGI special. Some artists who had worked on the special, such as colorist Tiffany Ford and art directors Kevin Dart, Ellie Michalka and Jasmin Lai, were later invited to join the ''Steven Universe'' team.<ref name=\":6\">{{harvnb|McDonnell|2017|p=49}}</ref> Cartoon Network also provided Sugar with a list of suggested writers; when she saw Ben Levin and Matt Burnett (former writers for ''[[Level Up (U.S. TV series)|Level Up]]'') on the list she immediately asked them to join her team because she was familiar with their work.<ref>{{harvnb|McDonnell|2017|pp=48\u201349}}</ref> Freelance artist Danny Hynes, whom the former supervising director Ian Jones-Quartey knew from his own project ''[[OK K.O.!

The drawings play a major role in forming episode ideas; Sugar looks at these designs and occasionally makes changes to key poses. Sugar likes to review and re-draw scenes and characters to add extra pathos and emotion to storyboards.<ref>{{harvnb|McDonnell|2017|p=207}}</ref> Each episode's storyboards are created by two artists, each of whom writes half of the dialogue and draws panels similar to comic strips. This process can be quite complex; the storyboard artists must create the [[cinematography]] and focus on [[scenic design]] in a way similar to film production. After the panels are made, the thumbnail-storyboard artists draw mannerisms and dialogue based on their own experiences; Sugar draws \"quintessential\" scenes from her memories of hanging out with her brother after school.<ref>{{harvnb|McDonnell|2017|p=118}}</ref> The storyboard artists then discuss their work with the rest of the crew and make any necessary changes.<ref>{{harvnb|McDonnell|2017|p=119}}</ref> After the team discussion, the storyboard artists draw a revised board\u2014based on the thumbnail board\u2014on a full-size panel with notes.

They discuss episode pacing and vary each season's texture by balancing \"lighter\" and \"heavier\" story arcs.<ref name=\":17\" /> Changes in major-character appearances\u2014such as Yellow Diamond\u2014in a storyline can be difficult for the writers.<ref name=\":15\" /> According to Ben Levin, writing a season of ''Steven Universe'' is like a \"jigsaw puzzle\" because the writing team must assemble a number of plot ideas, which are discarded if they do not benefit character growth. After further discussion and questions about the writing, an idea becomes an episode. After discussing a season's proposed episodes the \"puzzle\" is complete, and they begin writing a major story arc or a season finale. Burnett said writing a season is like an algebraic equation \"where one side is the season finale, and the x's and y's are the episodes we need for that solution to make sense\"; he cited \"Ocean Gem\", \"[[Steven the Sword Fighter]]\", \"Monster Buddies\", \"An Indirect Kiss\" and \"Serious Steven\" as examples. Those episodes led to the season-one finale as a minor story arc.<ref name=\":17\">{{harvnb|McDonnell|2017|p=106}}</ref> To develop new ideas for episodes, the writers play writing games. In one, a scenario with characters is drawn and passed to another writer. The second writer adds a few sentences before giving it to a third, until the drawing has a three-act story. Episodes such as \"Island Adventure\", \"Future Boy Zoltron\" and \"Onion Friend\" were written this way.<ref>{{harvnb|McDonnell|2017|pp=107\u2013108}}</ref> The writers also play drawing games, which design new Gem characters and technological ideas. Burnett said he and Levin use fewer ideas from the storyboarders than they previously did; storyboarders change fewer things than they did before because the episodes have a \"stronger continuity\".<ref name=\":15\" />\n\nAccording to Levin, he and Burnett try to balance the focus between the main characters\u2014with Steven in the center\u2014and the theme of episodes in their writing. The balance indicates Steven has the same interests on his human side as he does on his Gem side. Levin said the Gem mythology and drama would have been less interesting if Steven was not as well-developed in the first few episodes. Grateful to work on a show which is unafraid to be \"sincere and vulnerable\", he said if every episode was emotional the series would become formulaic; happy episodes balance out emotional ones.<ref name=\":17\" /> Levin said he and Burnett have found ways to integrate Steven's powers into the plot. The character's powers and home-world technology are revealed at a \"measured (very slow) pace\", satisfying the viewer and keeping the series clear of superhero territory.<ref name=\":15\" />\n\nBefore significant plotlines air, the writers reveal information relevant to a \"climactic\" episode for the audience. According to storyboard artist Hilary Florido, much of the series' action and magic are narrative climaxes, demonstrating the characters' discoveries, difficulties and views. Florido said if a character's evolution is not directly related to the plot, there is no drama.<ref name=\":15\" /> The crew is discouraged from breaking perspective involving episode development as they want the audience to know the protagonist's point of view. Although the writers could hint at future events, they prefer to focus on plot and develop Steven in real time. Levin said if the pilot tried to present Gem history in five minutes, the audience and protagonist would be equally confused.<ref name=\":14\" />\n\n=== Backgrounds ===\nThe production of background art begins after the approved storyboards are received. If the characters visit old locations, the pre-existing backgrounds are modified for authenticity; it is likely locations would change slightly over time. Steven Sugar likes to hide narrative bits in the backgrounds because he believes the key to world-building is \"having a cohesive underlying structure to everything\".<ref name=\":22\">{{harvnb|McDonnell|2017|p=174}}</ref> Former art director Elle Michalka said the backgrounds' artistic style was inspired by French post-impressionist painter [[Paul C\u00e9zanne]], whose apparent lack of focus belied detail and specificity. The art was also inspired by [[Tao Te Ching]], whose work highlights the importance of empty spaces, \"like the space within a vase as being part of the vase that makes it useful\".<ref name=\":22\"/> During the painting phase, the painters see the lines as \"descriptive bones\" and color is used loosely, meaning the color is intentionally slightly off register, highlighting the distinction between color and line.<ref name=\":22\"/> The painters used \"superimposed\" watercolor texture before switching to [[Adobe Photoshop|Photoshop]] because the former made the backgrounds \"very chunky\". When painting the backgrounds, they use one primary and several secondary colors; Amanda Winterston and Jasmin Lai found suitable color combinations. After the primary backgrounds are painted, they are sent to the color stylist, who chooses colors for a character or prop from model sheets, matching and complementing the storyboard and background. The lines of the character or prop are rarely colored. The lines are removed when scenes need light effects. The coloring in early season-one episodes was experimental because the stylist would have difficulty if a storyboard's character and background mixed together or a bright character walked unchanged into a shadow. Mistakes became rare as the crew planned and checked storyboards. The primary backgrounds are made in Burbank; the secondary ones by Korean artists.<ref name=\":23\">{{harvnb|McDonnell|2017|p=175}}</ref>\n\n=== Animation ===\nAfter the crew finishes constructing an episode, the production team sends it to animators in Korea. The animation is produced by [[Sunmin Image Pictures]] and [[Rough Draft Studios|Rough Draft Korea]]. The production team and animators communicate by email and sometimes use video chat when animating a major episode. Before sending the episode to one of the studios, animation director Nick DeMayo and his team create a plan for the animators after reviewing the [[Storyboard#Animatics|animatics]].<ref>{{harvnb|McDonnell|2017|p=197}}</ref> They then add character movements on [[exposure sheet]]s to guide the animators. Mouth assignments for the characters, describing mouth shapes and timing for lip-syncing, follow.<ref>{{harvnb|McDonnell|2017|pp=197\u2013198}}</ref> The episode is then sent to one of the animation studios. The black-and-white version is sent first, followed about two weeks later by the colored version<ref>{{harvnb|McDonnell|2017|p=198}}</ref> The animation is drawn and inked on paper, then scanned and colored digitally. The crew then arranges a \"work print\" meeting to discuss the episode and review it for errors. DeMayo notes any errors, removes them and sends the episode back to the animation studio or to Cartoon Network's post-production department to fix any remaining issues.<ref>{{harvnb|McDonnell|2017|p=199}}</ref> Minor animation mistakes or omissions are fixed by the crew.<ref>{{harvnb|McDonnell|2017|p=202}}</ref>\n\n=== Voice cast ===\n{{multiple image|perrow = 2|total_width=220\n| image1 = Zach Callison January 2015.jpg  |width1=1182|height1=1769 |alt1= Zach Callison smiling, wearing a blue \"85\" numbered shirt\n| image2 = Michaela Dietz at the Florida Supercon 2016 (4) (cropped).jpg  |width2=1791|height2=2602 |alt2= Michaela Dietz, smiling and holding a microphone\n| image3 = Deedee Magno Hall (2010).jpg  |width3=1096|height3=1677 |alt3= A smiling Deedee Magno in a black jacket.\n| image4 = Estelle Swaray (headshot).jpg|width4=197|height4=244 |alt4= Estelle, smiling, in a blue jacket\n| footer = The main voice cast ''(clockwise from top left''): [[Zach Callison]] ([[Steven Universe (character)|Steven]]), [[Michaela Dietz]] ([[Amethyst (Steven Universe)|Amethyst]]), [[Estelle (musician)|Estelle]] ([[Garnet (Steven Universe)|Garnet]]) and [[Deedee Magno]] ([[Pearl (Steven Universe)|Pearl]]) \n}}\nAmerican actor [[Zach Callison]] voices Steven.

Sound motifs and palettes were also created for locations, objects and abstract concepts.<ref name=\":21\" /> When Sugar or the other writers write a song for an episode, they record a demo that is sent to the composers. The same musical style for a song and the character singing it is used for each song. Over time, the songs have become increasingly complex and production has become more difficult because the show's original musical style no longer fits perfectly with the newer lyrical themes. An example is \"Here Comes a Thought\", sung by Estelle and [[AJ Michalka]] (who voices Stevonnie). The two were less inspired by a specific musical style, but rather by the song's \"feel\", which Sugar had explained to them.<ref>{{harvnb|McDonnell|2017|p=163}}</ref>\n\n==Broadcast==\nThe pilot episode of ''Steven Universe'' was released on Cartoon Network's video platform on May 21, 2013,<ref name=\"Amidi 2013-05-21\">{{cite web|url=http://www.cartoonbrew.com/tv/steven-universe-rebecca-sugar-cartoon-network-83118.html|title=Sneak Peek: Cartoon Network's ''Steven Universe'' by Rebecca Sugar|work=[[Cartoon Brew]]|date=May 21, 2013|last=Amidi|first=Amid|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130715224455/http://www.cartoonbrew.com/tv/steven-universe-rebecca-sugar-cartoon-network-83118.html|archivedate=July 15, 2013|df=}}</ref> and an edited version was released on July 20.<ref name=\"Bricken 2013-07-20\">{{cite news|url=http://io9.com/the-first-look-at-rebecca-sugars-amazing-new-cartoon-s-853310801|title=The first look at Rebecca Sugar's amazing new cartoon ''Steven Universe''|work=io9|date=July 20, 2013|last=Bricken|first=Rob|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130822113319/http://io9.com/the-first-look-at-rebecca-sugars-amazing-new-cartoon-s-853310801|archivedate=August 22, 2013|df=}}</ref> The pilot was shown at the 2013 [[San Diego Comic-Con]],<ref name=\"Wolfe 2013-07-22\">{{cite news|url=http://www.awn.com/news/cartoons/cn-sneak-peeks-rebecca-sugar-s-steven-universe|title=Cartoon Network Sneak Peeks Rebecca Sugar's ''Steven Universe''|work=Animation World Network|date=July 22, 2013|last=Wolfe|first=Jennifer|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130807004758/http://www.awn.com/news/cartoons/cn-sneak-peeks-rebecca-sugar-s-steven-universe|archivedate=August 7, 2013|df=}}</ref> and Sugar hosted a 30-minute panel discussion about the series at the 2013 [[New York Comic Con]] on October 13.<ref name=\"New York Comic Con 2013\">{{cite web|url=http://nycc13.mapyourshow.com/5_0/sessions/sessiondetails.cfm?ScheduledSessionID=18ABC9C6 |title=Cartoon Network presents ''Steven Universe'' |publisher=[[New York Comic Con]] |work=Panels & Autographing |year=2013 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130925210604/http://nycc13.mapyourshow.com/5_0/sessions/sessiondetails.cfm?ScheduledSessionID=18ABC9C6 |archivedate=September 25, 2013 |df= }}</ref> Initially, thirteen half-hours (26 episodes) were ordered for the first season; on November 14, the season was picked up for an additional thirteen half-hours.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://deadline.com/2013/11/paw-patrol-season-two-cartoon-network-634956/|title=Cartoon Network Orders More Episodes Of Rookies \u2018Uncle Grandpa\u2019, \u2018Steven Universe\u2019|work=Deadline|author=The Deadline Team|date=November 14, 2013|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140829043225/https://deadline.com/2013/11/paw-patrol-season-two-cartoon-network-634956/|archivedate=August 29, 2014|url-status=live|df=}}</ref> The series was renewed for a second season of 26 half-hours on July 25, 2014,<ref>{{cite web|url=https://hollywoodreporter.com/live-feed/comic-con-cartoon-network-renews-721092|title=Comic-Con Exclusive: Cartoon Network Renews 'Adventure Time,' 'Regular Show,' 3 More|last1=Goldberg|first1=Lesley|date=July 25, 2014|work=[[The Hollywood Reporter]]|publisher=[[Prometheus Global Media]]|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140726013349/http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/live-feed/comic-con-cartoon-network-renews-721092|archivedate=July 26, 2014|df=}}</ref> which began airing on March 13, 2015, and for a third season of 26 half-hours in July 2015.

This is reflected in the series' outreach to minorities that seldom appear elsewhere in animation and its broader themes; instead of delivering genre-typical, mustache-twirling villains, ''Steven Universe'' \"deals with issues of extraordinary violence and horror, depicts its characters in shades of grey, and subtly plays with matters of philosophy, morality, and interpersonal conflicts, all while refusing to reset any development to a ''status quo''\".<ref name=\"Pop Matters 15 January 2016\" />\n\n====Gender and sexuality====\n[[File:Pearl and Rose embracing in Steven Universe.jpg|thumb|Pearl (left) and Steven's mother, Rose Quartz, embrace in a [[Flashback (narrative)|flashback]] shot edited out of the British broadcast.

Club'', who noted that \"the show's superheroes are all women\".<ref name=\"A.V. Club 4 November 2015\" /> As a self-aware pastiche of \"[[magical girl]]\" anime, the series subverts the genre's premises by having Steven embody the loving femininity of the typical magical-girl protagonist without ridicule or losing his masculine side. Whitbrook characterized the series as being \"about love\u2014''all'' kinds of love\", including non-traditional forms such as the motherly and friendly bond between Steven and the Gems; and Garnet as the \"physical embodiment of a lesbian relationship\".<ref name=\"io9 16 June 2015\" />\n\nWhen placing the series on the honor list of the 2015 [[James Tiptree Jr. Award|Tiptree Award]], which recognizes works of science fiction or fantasy that explore and expand gender roles, the jury wrote; \"In the context of children's television, this show deals with gender in a much more open and mature way than is typical for the genre, and has some of the best writing of any cartoon&nbsp;... In addition to showing men and women who do not necessarily conform to standard American gender ideals, the show also gives us an agender/non-binary character and a thoughtful exploration of growing up\".<ref name=\"Tiptree 2016\" />\n\n[[Autostraddle]]'s Mey Rude wrote that ''Steven Universe'' was the most-recent animated series for a younger audience with significant [[queer]] themes, such as the  [[Androgyny|androgynous]] fusion [[Stevonnie]] and the romantic relationship between the Gems Ruby and Sapphire, whose fusion is the main character Garnet. This, according to Rude, reflects the growing prominence of these themes in children's cartoons; previous depictions were subtextual or minimal, such as the 2011 ''Adventure Time'' episode \"[[What Was Missing]]\", the 2014 series ''[[Clarence (2014 TV series)|Clarence]]'' or (more explicit but unexplored) the 2014 finale of Nickelodeon's ''[[The Legend of Korra]]''.

In her view, queer youth deserve to see themselves in stories as much as other children\u2014and, given pervasive [[heteronormativity]], not allowing them to do so can be harmful.

It is Cartoon Network's first animated series to be created solely by a woman. It is the [[coming-of-age story]] of a young boy, [[Steven Universe (character)|Steven Universe]] (voiced by [[Zach Callison]]), who lives with the Crystal Gems\u2014magical, humanoid aliens named [[Garnet (Steven Universe)|Garnet]] ([[Estelle (musician)|Estelle]]), [[Amethyst (Steven Universe)|Amethyst]] ([[Michaela Dietz]]), and [[Pearl (Steven Universe)|Pearl]] ([[Deedee Magno Hall]])\u2014in the fictional town of Beach City. Steven, who is half-Gem, has adventures with his friends and helps the Gems protect the world from their own kind. Its pilot was first shown on May 21, 2013, and the series premiered on November 4, 2013. Its fifth and final season concluded in January 2019. The TV film ''[[Steven Universe: The Movie]]'' was released on September 2, 2019, and an epilogue [[Limited series (television)|limited series]], ''[[Steven Universe Future]]'', premiered on December 7, 2019 and ended on March 27, 2020.\n\nThe themes of the series include love, family, and the importance of healthy interpersonal relationships. Sugar based the lead character on her younger brother Steven, who is an artist for the series. She developed ''Steven Universe'' while she was a writer and storyboard artist on ''[[Adventure Time]]'', which she left when Cartoon Network commissioned her series for full production. The series is storyboard-driven; when episodes are being produced the show's storyboard artists are responsible for writing the dialogue and creating the action. Books, comics and video games based on the series have been released. \n\nThe series has developed a broad fan base and has been critically acclaimed for its design, music, voice acting, characterization, prominence of [[LGBT|LGBTQ]] themes and [[science fantasy]] worldbuilding. The series won its first [[GLAAD Media Award]] for Outstanding Kids & Family Program in [[30th GLAAD Media Awards|2019]], becoming the first animated series to win the award. It also received its first [[Peabody Award]] for Children's & Youth Programming in 2019. It has been nominated for five [[Primetime Emmy Award for Short-format Animation|Emmy Awards]] and five [[Annie Awards]].\n\n==Synopsis==\n''Steven Universe'' is set in the fictional town of Beach City, [[Delmarva]],<ref>{{cite web|last1=Sugar|first1=Rebecca|title=I am Rebecca Sugar, creator of Steven Universe, and former Adventure Time storyboarder, AMA!|date=August 20, 2014|url=https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/2e4gmx/i_am_rebecca_sugar_creator_of_steven_universe_and/cjw4mo6|website=[[Reddit]]|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151213200144/https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/2e4gmx/i_am_rebecca_sugar_creator_of_steven_universe_and/cjw4mo6|archivedate=December 13, 2015|df=}}</ref> where the Crystal Gems live in an ancient beachside temple and protect humanity from monsters and other threats. The Gems are ageless alien warriors who project female humanoid forms from magical gemstones at the core of their being. The Crystal Gems comprise Garnet, Amethyst, Pearl and Steven\u2014a young, half-human, half-Gem boy who inherited his gemstone from his mother, the Crystal Gems' former leader Rose Quartz. As Steven tries to understand his gradually expanding range of powers, he spends his days with his father Greg, his best friend Connie, his magical pet lion, other residents of Beach City, and the Gems. He explores the abilities inherited from his mother, which include fusion\u2014the ability of Gems to merge their bodies and abilities to form new, more powerful personalities.\n\nThe series's first season gradually reveals that the Crystal Gems are remnants of a great interstellar empire. During their missions they visit ruins that were once important to Gem culture but have been derelict for millennia. The Gems are cut off from the Gem homeworld, and Steven learns that many of the monsters and artifacts they encounter are Gems who were corrupted by a Gem weapon of mass destruction and can no longer maintain rational, humanoid form. By the end of the first season, Steven learns that, millennia ago, the Gem empire intended to sterilize the Earth to incubate new Gems, but Rose Quartz led her supporters, the Crystal Gems, in a violent and apparently successful rebellion against this genocidal plan. The discovery and release of Lapis Lazuli, a Gem trapped on Earth for millennia, puts the Crystal Gems at risk from the Gem empire once more, leading to the arrival of hostile envoys Peridot and Jasper.\n\nIn the second season, Peridot allies with and eventually joins the Crystal Gems to prevent Earth's destruction by a Gem \"geo-weapon\" buried in the planet. During the third season, Lapis Lazuli decides to live on Earth with Peridot; Jasper is defeated and captured; and Steven learns that his mother assassinated one of the Gem empire's matriarchs, Pink Diamond. In the fourth season, as Steven wrestles with his conflicted feelings about his mother's actions, the Gem empire leaders Blue Diamond and Yellow Diamond begin to turn their full attention to Earth. In the fifth and final season, Steven learns that in fact his mother ''was'' Pink Diamond, who faked her death to assume the identity of Rose Quartz; he uses this revelation to persuade the other Diamonds to try to take responsibility for and fix the damage they have caused.\n\n==Conception==\n[[File:Rebecca Sugar Speaking at New York Comic Con 2014 - Peter Dzubay (cropped).jpeg|thumb|upright|alt=Rebecca Sugar, a smiling, bespectacled young woman|Rebecca Sugar (creator of ''Steven Universe'') is the first woman to create a show for Cartoon Network.]]\nIn 2011, after former Cartoon Network vice-president of comedy animation Curtis Lelash asked the staff for ideas for a new series, Rebecca Sugar\u2014an artist working for the network's series ''[[Adventure Time]]''\u2014described her initial ideas for what would become ''Steven Universe'', and the project was chosen for development. While developing her show, Sugar continued working on ''Adventure Time''.<ref>{{harvnb|McDonnell|2017|p=19}}</ref> The series evolved from a short story written by Sugar entitled \"Ballad of Margo and Dread\", about a sensitive child helping teenagers with problems they cannot verbalize.<ref>{{harvnb|McDonnell|2017|p=14}}</ref>\n\nCartoon Network executives commissioned the show after the crew's art presentation and Sugar became the first woman to create a show independently for the network.<ref name=\":8\">{{harvnb|McDonnell|2017|p=25}}</ref> Before a production team had been appointed, Sugar tried to alter elements of the show's plot and developed the character's identity so her crew would have the freedom she did when she worked for ''Adventure Time''.<ref name=\":3\">{{harvnb|McDonnell|2017|p=43}}</ref>\n\n=== Development ===\nWhen Sugar's show was commissioned, she resigned from her role as a storyboard artist on ''Adventure Time'' to focus on her own series.<ref name=\":3\" /> Sugar focused the pilot short on the main characters and their personalities to demonstrate the series' humor. The pilot is a [[Slice of life|slice-of-life]] episode that does not involve major events because the series' world was still in development.<ref name=\":0\" /> Sugar and her production team focused the plot on interaction between the Crystal Gems and Steven.<ref>{{harvnb|McDonnell|2017|pp=24\u201325}}</ref> Sugar strove to make her pilot distinctive in terms of its artistic and aesthetic detail but the time limit imposed upon her by Cartoon Network hampered her. This unsuccessful experience helped Sugar develop the show's concept; she said, \"to know that there is so much more that you can't see and the way that knowledge frustrates and excites and confuses and scares you\".<ref name=\":8\" />\n\nThe title character Steven is loosely based on Steven Sugar, Rebecca's younger brother.<ref name=\"Cavna 2013-11-01\" /> During ''Steven Universe''{{'s}} development, Sugar repeatedly asked her brother whether naming the show after him was a good idea; she stopped asking when it was commissioned. Her brother had no problem with it and trusted Sugar to use his name wisely.<ref name=\":4\" /> In an interview with the ''[[The New York Times|New York Times]],'' Sugar discussed developing the background of the show's protagonist, saying she wanted to base the character's viewpoint on her brother growing up \"where you're so comfortable in your life because you get all the attention, but you also want to rise up and not be the little brother\".<ref name=\"Ito 2013-07-26\">{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2013/07/28/movies/rising-animators-spring-into-motion.html|title=Rising Animators Spring Into Motion|last=Ito|first=Robert|date=July 26, 2013|work=New York Times|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130803055430/http://www.nytimes.com/2013/07/28/movies/rising-animators-spring-into-motion.html|archivedate=August 3, 2013|url-status=live|author2=Jeremy Egner|df=}}</ref>\n\nWhen the original pilot was presented to Cartoon Network executives, they told the crew the series would air in 2013.<ref name=\":8\" /> Cartoon Network released the original pilot in May 2013. Sugar and her team panicked because the series was going to be very different from the pilot episode. The pilot was popular when it was released, engendering forum discussions in which people expressed their hopes of seeing it on the air soon. Those who knew Rebecca Sugar from ''Adventure Time'' were also interested. Positive reaction to the show reassured its crew.<ref name=\":9\">{{harvnb|McDonnell|2017|p=77}}</ref>\n\nTo prepare for the show's commissioning by Cartoon Network, Sugar began assembling a production crew.<ref name=\":3\" /> Jackie Buscarino was engaged as a producer in September 2012 and was tasked with hiring people and supervising the show's crew.<ref name=\":5\">{{harvnb|McDonnell|2017|p=48}}</ref> During this period of development, Sugar and her team were moved to a building behind the main Cartoon Network studio and based on the same floor as the crew of ''[[The Powerpuff Girls]]'' CGI special. Some artists who had worked on the special, such as colorist Tiffany Ford and art directors Kevin Dart, Ellie Michalka and Jasmin Lai, were later invited to join the ''Steven Universe'' team.<ref name=\":6\">{{harvnb|McDonnell|2017|p=49}}</ref> Cartoon Network also provided Sugar with a list of suggested writers; when she saw Ben Levin and Matt Burnett (former writers for ''[[Level Up (U.S. TV series)|Level Up]]'') on the list she immediately asked them to join her team because she was familiar with their work.<ref>{{harvnb|McDonnell|2017|pp=48\u201349}}</ref> Freelance artist Danny Hynes, whom the former supervising director Ian Jones-Quartey knew from his own project ''[[OK K.O.! Let's Be Heroes|Lakewood Plaza Turbo]]'', became the show's lead character designer.<ref name=\":6\" /><ref>{{harvnb|McDonnell|2017|pp=49; 54}}</ref> Steven Sugar was assigned as the background designer after his work on the original pilot,<ref name=\":5\" /> and was assisted by Dart, Michalka, Lai, background painter Amanda Winterston and others.<ref name=\":7\">{{harvnb|McDonnell|2017|p=55}}</ref>\n\nDuring the art presentation, Jones-Quartey, Guy, Hynes and Steven Sugar created artwork that differed from their previous work. Jones-Quartey wanted to work with something new, retaining elements of the show's previous project.<ref name=\"McDonnell 2017 55; 60\">{{harvnb|McDonnell|2017|pp=55; 60}}</ref> He worked with Elle Michalka, who later took over his role as background painter for the presentation, to create concept art for an \"action-comedy\" series.<ref name=\":4\">{{harvnb|McDonnell|2017|p=60}}</ref> Around this time, Jones-Quartey added stars to the series' logo because he saw them as a versatile symbol. He later said he over-used them, and they were criticized at the art presentation.<ref name=\"McDonnell 2017 55; 60\" /> The art presentation's drawings were by Rebecca Sugar, Jones-Quartey, Hynes, Paul Villeco (a writer and storyboard artist) and Steven Sugar. Michalka did the painting.<ref>{{harvnb|McDonnell|2017|p=62}}</ref>\n\n=== Design ===\nDuring the development of the ''Steven Universe'' pilot, Sugar focused much attention on the design of the world, adding notes to her drawings.<ref name=\":1\">{{harvnb|McDonnell|2017|p=20}}</ref> Inspired by the idea of foreign figures (Gems) living human lives, she drew many sketches depicting their world and history. The series' design was also inspired by her and her brother's interest in video games, comics and animation.<ref name=\":0\" /> After the series was commissioned, Sugar decided to redesign everything to make the series \"flexible and simple\" for future production staff to add ideas of their own.<ref name=\":3\" /> During this time, the art director was Kevin Dart, followed by Jasmin Lai, Elle Michalka, and Ricky Cometa.<ref>{{harvnb|McDonnell|2017|p=169}}</ref> Dart's artistic style has remained a great influence on the show long after his departure. Steven Sugar praised Dart's work and was inspired by him in college years, saying Dart had more ideas for the art than he did.<ref name=\":7\" />\n\nIn the pilot, only two locations appeared (the Temple and the Big Donut). The Temple was designed by Ian Jones-Quartey, Steven Sugar, Ben Levin, Matt Burnett and [[Andy Ristaino]].

The series' storyboard artists are also its writers.]]\nDuring storyboard meetings, artists draw their ideas on [[post-it note]]s, which are then attached to walls, table and boxes in the corners of their conference room. The drawings play a major role in forming episode ideas; Sugar looks at these designs and occasionally makes changes to key poses. Sugar likes to review and re-draw scenes and characters to add extra pathos and emotion to storyboards.<ref>{{harvnb|McDonnell|2017|p=207}}</ref> Each episode's storyboards are created by two artists, each of whom writes half of the dialogue and draws panels similar to comic strips. This process can be quite complex; the storyboard artists must create the [[cinematography]] and focus on [[scenic design]] in a way similar to film production. After the panels are made, the thumbnail-storyboard artists draw mannerisms and dialogue based on their own experiences; Sugar draws \"quintessential\" scenes from her memories of hanging out with her brother after school.<ref>{{harvnb|McDonnell|2017|p=118}}</ref> The storyboard artists then discuss their work with the rest of the crew and make any necessary changes.<ref>{{harvnb|McDonnell|2017|p=119}}</ref> After the team discussion, the storyboard artists draw a revised board\u2014based on the thumbnail board\u2014on a full-size panel with notes. The storyboards are again discussed, corrected and finally approved.<ref>{{harvnb|McDonnell|2017|p=124}}</ref>\n\n=== Writing ===\nDuring the pilot development, Sugar wrote and sketched a number of plot ideas that later became episodes.<ref>{{harvnb|McDonnell|2017|p=21}}</ref> The series' initial premise focused mostly on Steven's human side, rather than his magic side, but the premise was later changed.<ref>{{harvnb|McDonnell|2017|pp=43; 48}}</ref> Sugar developed the Gems' history in conjunction with the pilot episode.<ref name=\":0\" /> While the first season of the show introduced the human and Gem characters and their relationships, Sugar began to plot and explore second-season storylines involving the Crystal Gems.<ref name=\":16\">{{harvnb|McDonnell|2017|p=111}}</ref> Eventually, Sugar created a chart with taped printouts about a 2,000-year Gem and Earth history, with a number of events needing to be \"fleshed out\" for production. Although the series' overall plot is established, the writers improvise to arrive at its ending; according to Matt Burnett, the storylines will be resolved by the series' end.<ref name=\":10\">{{harvnb|McDonnell|2017|p=105}}</ref> Sugar wanted the series to focus on comedy and positivity before exploring controversial subjects involving the main characters, thinking it was \"more honest\" to begin the show with happiness instead of action or drama.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nThe writers\u2014formerly Levin and Burnett\u2014would write the premises and outlines while the storyboarders wrote and drew the episodes.<ref name=\":13\">{{harvnb|McDonnell|2017|p=107}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |url=http://ianjq.tumblr.com/post/74241332119/hey-i-am-a-screenwriting-student-from-emerson |title=Hey!

They discuss episode pacing and vary each season's texture by balancing \"lighter\" and \"heavier\" story arcs.<ref name=\":17\" /> Changes in major-character appearances\u2014such as Yellow Diamond\u2014in a storyline can be difficult for the writers.<ref name=\":15\" /> According to Ben Levin, writing a season of ''Steven Universe'' is like a \"jigsaw puzzle\" because the writing team must assemble a number of plot ideas, which are discarded if they do not benefit character growth. After further discussion and questions about the writing, an idea becomes an episode. After discussing a season's proposed episodes the \"puzzle\" is complete, and they begin writing a major story arc or a season finale. Burnett said writing a season is like an algebraic equation \"where one side is the season finale, and the x's and y's are the episodes we need for that solution to make sense\"; he cited \"Ocean Gem\", \"[[Steven the Sword Fighter]]\", \"Monster Buddies\", \"An Indirect Kiss\" and \"Serious Steven\" as examples. Those episodes led to the season-one finale as a minor story arc.<ref name=\":17\">{{harvnb|McDonnell|2017|p=106}}</ref> To develop new ideas for episodes, the writers play writing games. In one, a scenario with characters is drawn and passed to another writer. The second writer adds a few sentences before giving it to a third, until the drawing has a three-act story. Episodes such as \"Island Adventure\", \"Future Boy Zoltron\" and \"Onion Friend\" were written this way.<ref>{{harvnb|McDonnell|2017|pp=107\u2013108}}</ref> The writers also play drawing games, which design new Gem characters and technological ideas. Burnett said he and Levin use fewer ideas from the storyboarders than they previously did; storyboarders change fewer things than they did before because the episodes have a \"stronger continuity\".<ref name=\":15\" />\n\nAccording to Levin, he and Burnett try to balance the focus between the main characters\u2014with Steven in the center\u2014and the theme of episodes in their writing. The balance indicates Steven has the same interests on his human side as he does on his Gem side. Levin said the Gem mythology and drama would have been less interesting if Steven was not as well-developed in the first few episodes. Grateful to work on a show which is unafraid to be \"sincere and vulnerable\", he said if every episode was emotional the series would become formulaic; happy episodes balance out emotional ones.<ref name=\":17\" /> Levin said he and Burnett have found ways to integrate Steven's powers into the plot. The character's powers and home-world technology are revealed at a \"measured (very slow) pace\", satisfying the viewer and keeping the series clear of superhero territory.<ref name=\":15\" />\n\nBefore significant plotlines air, the writers reveal information relevant to a \"climactic\" episode for the audience. According to storyboard artist Hilary Florido, much of the series' action and magic are narrative climaxes, demonstrating the characters' discoveries, difficulties and views. Florido said if a character's evolution is not directly related to the plot, there is no drama.<ref name=\":15\" /> The crew is discouraged from breaking perspective involving episode development as they want the audience to know the protagonist's point of view. Although the writers could hint at future events, they prefer to focus on plot and develop Steven in real time. Levin said if the pilot tried to present Gem history in five minutes, the audience and protagonist would be equally confused.<ref name=\":14\" />\n\n=== Backgrounds ===\nThe production of background art begins after the approved storyboards are received. If the characters visit old locations, the pre-existing backgrounds are modified for authenticity; it is likely locations would change slightly over time. Steven Sugar likes to hide narrative bits in the backgrounds because he believes the key to world-building is \"having a cohesive underlying structure to everything\".<ref name=\":22\">{{harvnb|McDonnell|2017|p=174}}</ref> Former art director Elle Michalka said the backgrounds' artistic style was inspired by French post-impressionist painter [[Paul C\u00e9zanne]], whose apparent lack of focus belied detail and specificity. The art was also inspired by [[Tao Te Ching]], whose work highlights the importance of empty spaces, \"like the space within a vase as being part of the vase that makes it useful\".<ref name=\":22\"/> During the painting phase, the painters see the lines as \"descriptive bones\" and color is used loosely, meaning the color is intentionally slightly off register, highlighting the distinction between color and line.<ref name=\":22\"/> The painters used \"superimposed\" watercolor texture before switching to [[Adobe Photoshop|Photoshop]] because the former made the backgrounds \"very chunky\". When painting the backgrounds, they use one primary and several secondary colors; Amanda Winterston and Jasmin Lai found suitable color combinations. After the primary backgrounds are painted, they are sent to the color stylist, who chooses colors for a character or prop from model sheets, matching and complementing the storyboard and background. The lines of the character or prop are rarely colored. The lines are removed when scenes need light effects. The coloring in early season-one episodes was experimental because the stylist would have difficulty if a storyboard's character and background mixed together or a bright character walked unchanged into a shadow. Mistakes became rare as the crew planned and checked storyboards. The primary backgrounds are made in Burbank; the secondary ones by Korean artists.<ref name=\":23\">{{harvnb|McDonnell|2017|p=175}}</ref>\n\n=== Animation ===\nAfter the crew finishes constructing an episode, the production team sends it to animators in Korea. The animation is produced by [[Sunmin Image Pictures]] and [[Rough Draft Studios|Rough Draft Korea]]. The production team and animators communicate by email and sometimes use video chat when animating a major episode. Before sending the episode to one of the studios, animation director Nick DeMayo and his team create a plan for the animators after reviewing the [[Storyboard#Animatics|animatics]].<ref>{{harvnb|McDonnell|2017|p=197}}</ref> They then add character movements on [[exposure sheet]]s to guide the animators. Mouth assignments for the characters, describing mouth shapes and timing for lip-syncing, follow.<ref>{{harvnb|McDonnell|2017|pp=197\u2013198}}</ref> The episode is then sent to one of the animation studios. The black-and-white version is sent first, followed about two weeks later by the colored version<ref>{{harvnb|McDonnell|2017|p=198}}</ref> The animation is drawn and inked on paper, then scanned and colored digitally. The crew then arranges a \"work print\" meeting to discuss the episode and review it for errors. DeMayo notes any errors, removes them and sends the episode back to the animation studio or to Cartoon Network's post-production department to fix any remaining issues.<ref>{{harvnb|McDonnell|2017|p=199}}</ref> Minor animation mistakes or omissions are fixed by the crew.<ref>{{harvnb|McDonnell|2017|p=202}}</ref>\n\n=== Voice cast ===\n{{multiple image|perrow = 2|total_width=220\n| image1 = Zach Callison January 2015.jpg  |width1=1182|height1=1769 |alt1= Zach Callison smiling, wearing a blue \"85\" numbered shirt\n| image2 = Michaela Dietz at the Florida Supercon 2016 (4) (cropped).jpg  |width2=1791|height2=2602 |alt2= Michaela Dietz, smiling and holding a microphone\n| image3 = Deedee Magno Hall (2010).jpg  |width3=1096|height3=1677 |alt3= A smiling Deedee Magno in a black jacket.\n| image4 = Estelle Swaray (headshot).jpg|width4=197|height4=244 |alt4= Estelle, smiling, in a blue jacket\n| footer = The main voice cast ''(clockwise from top left''): [[Zach Callison]] ([[Steven Universe (character)|Steven]]), [[Michaela Dietz]] ([[Amethyst (Steven Universe)|Amethyst]]), [[Estelle (musician)|Estelle]] ([[Garnet (Steven Universe)|Garnet]]) and [[Deedee Magno]] ([[Pearl (Steven Universe)|Pearl]]) \n}}\nAmerican actor [[Zach Callison]] voices Steven.

The same musical style for a song and the character singing it is used for each song.

An example is \"Here Comes a Thought\", sung by Estelle and [[AJ Michalka]] (who voices Stevonnie).

Club 11 November 2013\" /> Thurm wrote that a notable emotional difference between ''Steven Universe'', and ''Adventure Time'' and ''[[Regular Show]]'', is that the latter two series deal with their protagonists' transitions to adulthood whereas during its first season, ''Steven Universe'' was content to be \"enamored with the simplicity of childhood\".<ref name=\"A.V.

Club 12 March 2015\" /> Joe Cain noted in ''[[The Mary Sue]]'' that unlike heroes from antiquity ([[Hercules]]) and modern fiction ([[Luke Skywalker]]), Steven is defined by his mother's legacy rather than his father's; the preponderance of mother figures in the series underscores their rarity in other fiction.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Cain|first1=Joseph|title=Superheroes, Steven Universe, and the Maternal Narrative|url=http://www.themarysue.com/steven-universe-maternal-narrative/|work=The Mary Sue|date=May 13, 2016|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160514112356/http://www.themarysue.com/steven-universe-maternal-narrative/|archivedate=May 14, 2016|df=}}</ref> According to Kat Smalley of [[PopMatters]], the Gems' alien nature, which prevents them from fully understanding the world they protect, is handled with \"remarkable depth and intellectual rigor\", even as they deal with human issues such as \"[[Depression (mood)|depression]], [[Posttraumatic stress disorder|post-traumatic stress]], and self-loathing\" remaining from the long-past war for Earth.<ref name=\"Pop Matters 15 January 2016\">{{Cite news |url=https://popmatters.com/feature/steven-universe-cartoon-networks-avant-garde-animation/ |title='Steven Universe': Cartoon Network's Avant-Garde Animation |last=Smalley |first=Kat |date=January 15, 2016 |work=[[Pop Matters]] |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170906004121/http://www.popmatters.com/feature/steven-universe-cartoon-networks-avant-garde-animation/ |archive-date=September 6, 2017 |url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nSmalley characterized ''Steven Universe'' as part of a growing trend of cartoons that appeal to adults and children alike; which includes ''[[Avatar: The Last Airbender]]'' (2005), its sequel ''[[The Legend of Korra]]'' (2012), ''Adventure Time'' (2010) and ''Regular Show'' (2010). This is reflected in the series' outreach to minorities that seldom appear elsewhere in animation and its broader themes; instead of delivering genre-typical, mustache-twirling villains, ''Steven Universe'' \"deals with issues of extraordinary violence and horror, depicts its characters in shades of grey, and subtly plays with matters of philosophy, morality, and interpersonal conflicts, all while refusing to reset any development to a ''status quo''\".<ref name=\"Pop Matters 15 January 2016\" />\n\n====Gender and sexuality====\n[[File:Pearl and Rose embracing in Steven Universe.jpg|thumb|Pearl (left) and Steven's mother, Rose Quartz, embrace in a [[Flashback (narrative)|flashback]] shot edited out of the British broadcast.

Club'', who noted that \"the show's superheroes are all women\".<ref name=\"A.V. Club 4 November 2015\" /> As a self-aware pastiche of \"[[magical girl]]\" anime, the series subverts the genre's premises by having Steven embody the loving femininity of the typical magical-girl protagonist without ridicule or losing his masculine side. Whitbrook characterized the series as being \"about love\u2014''all'' kinds of love\", including non-traditional forms such as the motherly and friendly bond between Steven and the Gems; and Garnet as the \"physical embodiment of a lesbian relationship\".<ref name=\"io9 16 June 2015\" />\n\nWhen placing the series on the honor list of the 2015 [[James Tiptree Jr. Award|Tiptree Award]], which recognizes works of science fiction or fantasy that explore and expand gender roles, the jury wrote; \"In the context of children's television, this show deals with gender in a much more open and mature way than is typical for the genre, and has some of the best writing of any cartoon&nbsp;... In addition to showing men and women who do not necessarily conform to standard American gender ideals, the show also gives us an agender/non-binary character and a thoughtful exploration of growing up\".<ref name=\"Tiptree 2016\" />\n\n[[Autostraddle]]'s Mey Rude wrote that ''Steven Universe'' was the most-recent animated series for a younger audience with significant [[queer]] themes, such as the  [[Androgyny|androgynous]] fusion [[Stevonnie]] and the romantic relationship between the Gems Ruby and Sapphire, whose fusion is the main character Garnet. This, according to Rude, reflects the growing prominence of these themes in children's cartoons; previous depictions were subtextual or minimal, such as the 2011 ''Adventure Time'' episode \"[[What Was Missing]]\", the 2014 series ''[[Clarence (2014 TV series)|Clarence]]'' or (more explicit but unexplored) the 2014 finale of Nickelodeon's ''[[The Legend of Korra]]''.

In her view, queer youth deserve to see themselves in stories as much as other children\u2014and, given pervasive [[heteronormativity]], not allowing them to do so can be harmful. LGBT children deserve to see the prospect of love for themselves in the characters with whom they identify\u2014the ideal of fulfilling partnership and true love, established as the thing to aspire to

He was a grandson of the ninth president, [[William Henry Harrison]], creating the only grandfather{{endash}}grandson duo to have held the office. He was also a great-grandson of [[Benjamin Harrison V]], a [[Founding Fathers of the United States|founding father]] who signed the [[United States Declaration of Independence]].\n\nHarrison was born on a farm by the [[Ohio River]] and graduated from Miami University in Oxford, Ohio.  After moving to [[Indianapolis]], Harrison established himself as a prominent local attorney, Presbyterian church leader, and politician in [[Indiana]]. During the [[American Civil War]], he served in the [[Union Army]] as a [[Colonel (United States)|colonel]], and was confirmed by the [[United States Senate|U.S. Senate]] as a [[Brevet (military)|brevet]] [[Brigadier general (United States)|brigadier general]] of volunteers in 1865. Harrison unsuccessfully ran for [[governor of Indiana]] in 1876. The [[Indiana General Assembly]] elected Harrison to a six-year term in the [[United States Senate|U.S. Senate]], where he served from 1881 to 1887.\n\nA [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]], Harrison was elected to the presidency in [[1888 United States presidential election|1888]], defeating the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic]] incumbent, [[Grover Cleveland]]. Hallmarks of Harrison's administration included unprecedented economic legislation, including the [[McKinley Tariff]], which imposed historic protective trade rates, and the [[Sherman Antitrust Act]]. Harrison also facilitated the creation of the [[United States National Forest|national forest reserves]] through an amendment to the Land Revision Act of 1891. During his administration six western states were admitted to the Union. In addition, Harrison substantially strengthened and modernized the [[United States Navy|U.S. Navy]] and conducted an active foreign policy, but his proposals to secure federal education funding as well as voting rights enforcement for [[African Americans]] were unsuccessful.\n\nDue in large part to surplus revenues from the tariffs, federal spending reached one billion dollars for the first time during his term. The spending issue in part led to the defeat of the Republicans in the [[1890 United States House election|1890 mid-term elections]]. Cleveland defeated Harrison for re-election in [[1892 United States presidential election|1892]], due to the growing unpopularity of the high tariff and high federal spending. Harrison returned to private life and his law practice in Indianapolis. In 1899 Harrison represented the [[Republic of Venezuela]] in their [[British Guiana]] boundary dispute against the [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland|United Kingdom]]. Harrison traveled to the court of [[Paris]] as part of the case and after a brief stay returned to Indianapolis. He died at his home in Indianapolis in 1901 of complications from [[influenza]]. Although many have praised Harrison's commitment to African Americans' voting rights, scholars and historians generally regard his administration as below-average, and [[Historical rankings of Presidents of the United States|rank him in the bottom half]] among U.S. presidents. Historians, however, have not questioned Harrison's commitment to personal and official integrity.\n\n==Family and education==\n[[File:JSHarrison.jpg|thumb|left|upright=.5|John Scott Harrison]]\n[[File:Benjamin Harrison Birth Site.jpg|thumb|right|Birthplace marker in [[North Bend, Ohio]]]]\n\nHarrison was born on August 20, 1833, in [[North Bend, Ohio]], the second of Elizabeth Ramsey (Irwin) and [[John Scott Harrison]]'s ten children.  His paternal ancestors were the [[Harrison family of Virginia]], whose immigrant ancestor, Benjamin Harrison, arrived in [[Jamestown, Virginia]], circa 1630 from [[England]].

Fr\u00e9mont]].{{sfn|Calhoun|2005|p=18}} In 1857 Harrison was elected as the Indianapolis city attorney, a position that paid an annual salary of $400 ({{Inflation|US|400|1857|fmt=eq}}).{{sfn|Moore|Hale|2006|p=29}}{{sfn|Boomhower|p=50}}\n\nIn 1858, Harrison entered into a law partnership with William Wallace to form the law office of Wallace and Harrison.{{sfnm|Calhoun|2005|1p=28|Sievers|1968|2loc=v. 1, p. 105}} Two years later, in 1860, Harrison successfully ran as the Republican candidate for [[Reporter of decisions|reporter]] of the [[Indiana Supreme Court]].{{sfn|Boomhower|p=50}} Harrison was an active supporter of the Republican Party's platform and served as Republican State Committee's secretary. After Wallace, his law partner, was elected as county clerk in 1860, Harrison established a new firm with William Fishback that was named Fishback and Harrison. The new partners worked together until Harrison entered the [[Union Army]] after the start of the [[American Civil War]].{{sfn|Sievers|1968|loc=v. 1|p=171}}\n\n==Civil War==\n[[File:General-Benjamin-Harrison-in-uniform,-1865.jpg|thumb|upright|Brigadier General Harrison (left) with other commanders of the XX Corps, 1865]]\nIn 1862, [[President of the United States|President]] [[Abraham Lincoln]] issued a call for more recruits for the Union Army; Harrison wanted to enlist, but worried about how to support his young family.{{sfn|Calhoun|2005|p=20}} While visiting Governor [[Oliver Morton]], Harrison found him distressed over the shortage of men answering the latest call.

Harrison recruited throughout northern Indiana to raise a regiment. Morton offered him the command, but Harrison declined, as he had no military experience. He was initially commissioned as a captain and company commander on July 22, 1862. Governor Morton commissioned Harrison as a colonel on August 7, 1862, and the newly formed [[70th Indiana Infantry Regiment|70th Indiana]] was mustered into Federal service on August 12, 1862. Once mustered, the regiment left Indiana to join the Union Army at Louisville, Kentucky.{{sfnm|Wallace|1888|1pp=180\u2013181|Calhoun|2005|2pp=21\u201323, 41, 44}}<ref>{{cite book|last1=Terrell|first1=W.H.H.|title=Report of the Adjutant General of the State of Indiana|date=1865|publisher=W.R.

In 1864, Harrison and his regiment joined [[William T. Sherman]]'s [[Atlanta Campaign]] and moved to the front lines. On January 2, 1864, Harrison was promoted to command the 1st Brigade of the 1st Division of the [[XX Corps (Union Army)|XX Corps]]. He commanded the [[brigade]] at the battles of [[Battle of Resaca|Resaca]], [[Cassville, Georgia|Cassville]], [[Battle of New Hope Church|New Hope Church]], Lost Mountain, [[Battle of Kennesaw Mountain|Kennesaw Mountain]], [[Battle of Marietta|Marietta]], [[Battle of Peachtree Creek|Peachtree Creek]], and [[Battle of Atlanta|Atlanta]].

Democrats wanted to reduce the [[tariff]] and limit the amount of money the government took in; Republicans instead wanted to spend the money on [[internal improvements]] and pensions for Civil War veterans. Harrison took his party's side and advocated for generous [[pension]]s for veterans and their widows.{{sfn|Calhoun|2005|p=39}} He also unsuccessfully supported aid for the education of Southerners, especially the children of the freedmen; he believed that education was necessary to help the black population rise to political and economic equality with whites. {{sfn|Calhoun|2005|pp=39\u201340}} Harrison opposed the [[Chinese Exclusion Act (United States)|Chinese Exclusion Act of 1882]], which his party supported, because he thought it violated existing treaties with [[China]].{{sfn|Calhoun|2005|p=40}}\n\nIn 1884, Harrison and Gresham competed for influence at the [[1884 Republican National Convention]]; the delegation ended up supporting [[James G.

Harrison reprised a more traditional [[front porch campaign|front-porch campaign]], abandoned by his immediate predecessors; he received visiting delegations to Indianapolis and made over ninety pronouncements from his hometown.{{sfn|Socolofsky & Spetter|p=11}} The Republicans campaigned heavily in favor of [[tariff|protective tariffs]], turning out protectionist voters in the important industrial states of the North. The election focused on the swing states of New York, New Jersey, Connecticut, and Harrison's home state of Indiana.{{sfn|Socolofsky & Spetter|p=10}} Harrison and Cleveland split these four states, with Harrison winning in New York and Indiana.{{sfnm|Calhoun|2005|1p=43|Socolofsky & Spetter || 2p=13}} Voter turnout was 79.3%, reflecting a large interest in the campaign; nearly eleven million votes were cast.{{sfn|Calhoun|2005|p=57}} Although Harrison received 90,000 fewer popular votes than Cleveland, he carried the [[Electoral College (United States)|Electoral College]] 233 to 168.<ref name=\"EV 1888\" /> Allegations were made against Republicans for engaging in irregular ballot practices; an example was described as [[Blocks of Five]].{{sfnm|Socolofsky & Spetter || 1p=13|Williams || 2pp=191\u2013192}} On October 31 the ''Indiana Sentinel'' published a letter allegedly written by Harrison's friend and supporter, [[William Wade Dudley]], to bribe voters in \"blocks of five\" to ensure Harrison's election. Harrison neither defended nor repudiated Dudley, but allowed him to remain on the campaign for the remaining few days. After the election, Harrison never spoke to Dudley again.{{sfn|Williams|pp=191\u2013192}}\n\nAlthough Harrison had made no political bargains, his supporters had given many pledges upon his behalf. When Boss [[Matthew Quay]] of Pennsylvania, who was rebuffed for a Cabinet position for his political support during the convention, heard that Harrison ascribed his narrow victory to [[Divine Providence|Providence]], Quay exclaimed that Harrison would never know \"how close a number of men were compelled to approach...the penitentiary to make him President\".{{sfn|Calhoun|2005|pp=55, 60}} Harrison was known as the Centennial President because his inauguration celebrated the [[George Washington's legacy#Centennial celebration|centenary of the first inauguration]] of [[George Washington]] in 1789.{{sfn|Calhoun|2005|pp=47\u201354}} In congressional elections, the Republicans increased their membership in the House of Representatives by nineteen seats.{{sfn|Socolofsky & Spetter|p=14}}\n{{clear}}\n\n==Presidency 1889\u20131893==\n{{Main|Presidency of Benjamin Harrison}}\n\n===Inauguration and cabinet===\n{{CSS image crop|Image = HARRISON, Benjamin-President (BEP engraved portrait).jpg |bSize = 325|cWidth = 230|cHeight = 270|oTop = 50|oLeft = 50|Location = right|Description = [[Bureau of Engraving and Printing|BEP]] engraved portrait of Harrison as President }}\n\nHarrison was sworn into office on Monday, March 4, 1889, by [[Chief Justice of the United States|Chief Justice]] [[Melville Fuller]]. His speech was brief \u2013 half as long as that of his grandfather, William Henry Harrison, whose speech holds the record for the longest inaugural address of a U.S. president.{{sfn|Socolofsky & Spetter|pp=1\u20132}} In his speech, Benjamin Harrison credited the nation's growth to the influences of education and religion, urged the cotton states and mining territories to attain the industrial proportions of the eastern states and promised a protective tariff. Concerning commerce, he said, \"If our great corporations would more scrupulously observe their legal obligations and duties, they would have less call to complain of the limitations of their rights or of interference with their operations.\"{{sfn|Socolofsky & Spetter|p=3}} Harrison also urged early statehood for the territories and advocated pensions for veterans, a statement that was met with enthusiastic applause. In foreign affairs, Harrison reaffirmed the [[Monroe Doctrine]] as a mainstay of foreign policy, while urging modernization of the Navy and a merchant marine force. He gave his commitment to international peace through noninterference in the affairs of foreign governments.<ref name=\"Benjamin Harrison Inauguration\" />\n\n[[John Philip Sousa]]'s [[Marine Corps]] band played at the Inaugural Ball inside the [[National Building Museum|Pension Building]] with a large crowd attending.{{sfn|Socolofsky & Spetter|pp=5\u20136}} After moving into the White House, Harrison noted, quite prophetically, \"There is only a door \u2013 one that is never locked \u2013 between the president's office and what are not very accurately called his private apartments. There should be an executive office building, not too far away, but wholly distinct from the dwelling house.

Cleveland held Harrison's umbrella.]]\n\nHarrison acted quite independently in selecting his cabinet, much to the dismay of the Republican bosses. He began by delaying the presumed nomination of James G. Blaine as Secretary of State so as to preclude Blaine's involvement in the formation of the administration, as had occurred in President Garfield's term.{{sfn|Socolofsky & Spetter|pp=20\u201322}} In fact, other than Blaine, the only Republican boss initially nominated was Redfield Proctor, as Secretary of War. Senator Shelby Cullom's comment symbolizes Harrison's steadfast aversion to use federal positions for patronage: \"I suppose Harrison treated me as well as he did any other Senator; but whenever he did anything for me, it was done so ungraciously that the concession tended to anger rather than please.\"{{sfn|Socolofsky & Spetter|p=33}} Harrison's selections shared particular alliances \u2013 such as their service in the Civil War, Indiana citizenship and membership in the Presbyterian Church.{{sfn|Socolofsky & Spetter|p=20}} Nevertheless, Harrison with these choices had alienated pivotal Republican operatives from New York to Pennsylvania to Iowa and prematurely compromised his political power and future.{{sfn|Socolofsky & Spetter|pp=22\u201330}} Harrison's normal schedule provided for two full cabinet meetings per week, as well as separate weekly one-on-one meetings with each cabinet member.{{sfn|Socolofsky & Spetter|p=85}}\n\nIn June 1890, Harrison's Postmaster General [[John Wanamaker]] and several Philadelphia friends purchased a large new cottage at [[Cape May Point, New Jersey|Cape May Point]] for Harrison's wife [[Caroline Harrison|Caroline]]. Many believed the cottage gift appeared to be improper and amounted to a bribe for a cabinet position. Harrison made no comment on the matter until after two weeks when he said he had always intended to purchase the cottage once Caroline gave approval. On July 2, perhaps a little tardily to avoid suspicion, Harrison gave Wanamaker a check for $10,000 ({{Inflation|US|10000|1890|fmt=eq}}) to pay for the cottage.{{sfn|Williams|p=194}}\n\n===Civil service reform and pensions===\n[[File:Benjamin Harrison by Eastman Johnson.png|thumb|upright=.75|[[Eastman Johnson]]'s portrait of Benjamin Harrison, c. 1890\u20131900]]\n\n[[Civil service]] reform was a prominent issue following Harrison's election. Harrison had campaigned as a supporter of the [[merit system]], as opposed to the [[spoils system]].{{sfn|Socolofsky & Spetter|p=32}} Although some of the civil service had been classified under the [[Pendleton Civil Service Reform Act|Pendleton Act]] by previous administrations, Harrison spent much of his first months in office deciding on political appointments.{{sfn|Socolofsky & Spetter|pp=32\u201336}} Congress was widely divided on the issue and Harrison was reluctant to address the issue in hope of preventing the alienation of either side. The issue became a [[political football]] of the time and was immortalized in a cartoon captioned \"What can I do when both parties insist on kicking?\"{{sfn|Moore|Hale|2006|pp=83, 86}} Harrison appointed [[Theodore Roosevelt]] and [[Hugh Smith Thompson]], both reformers, to the [[United States Civil Service Commission|Civil Service Commission]], but otherwise did little to further the reform cause.{{sfn|Socolofsky & Spetter|pp=39\u201341}}\n\n[[File:Harrison Football Political Cartoon.jpg|thumb|left|[[Political football]]]]\n\nHarrison quickly saw the enactment of the [[Dependent and Disability Pension Act]] in 1890, a cause he had championed while in Congress. In addition to providing pensions to disabled Civil War veterans (regardless of the cause of their disability), the Act depleted some of the troublesome federal budget surplus. Pension expenditures reached $135&nbsp;million under Harrison (equivalent to ${{Inflation|US|.135|1893|r=1}}&nbsp;billion in {{Inflation/year|US}}), the largest expenditure of its kind to that point in American history, a problem exacerbated by [[Pension Bureau]] commissioner [[James R. Tanner]]'s expansive interpretation of the pension laws.{{sfnm|Socolofsky & Spetter || 1pp=36\u201337|Calhoun|2005|2pp=72\u201373}} An investigation into the Pension Bureau by Harrison's Secretary of Interior [[John Willock Noble]] found evidence of lavish and illegal handouts under Tanner.{{sfn|Williams|p=193}} Harrison, who privately believed that appointing Tanner had been a mistake, due to his apparent loose management style and tongue, asked Tanner to resign and replaced him with [[Green Berry Raum|Green B. Raum]].{{sfn|Socolofsky & Spetter|pp=34\u201336}} Raum was also accused of accepting loan payments in return for expediting pension cases. Harrison, having accepted a dissenting Congressional Republican investigation report that exonerated Raum, kept him in office for the rest of his administration.{{sfn|Williams|pp=193\u2013194}}\n\nOne of the first appointments Harrison was forced to reverse was that of James S. Clarkson as an assistant postmaster. Clarkson, who had expected a full cabinet position, began sabotaging the appointment from the outset, gaining the reputation for \"decapitating a fourth class postmaster every three minutes\". Clarkson himself stated, \"I am simply on detail from the Republican Committee&nbsp;... I am most anxious to get through this task and leave.\" He resigned in September 1890.{{sfn|Socolofsky & Spetter|pp=34\u201336}}\n\n===Tariff===\n[[File:Billion dollar Congress.jpg|thumb|upright=.75|Harrison and the [[51st United States Congress|Billion-Dollar Congress]] are portrayed as wasting the surplus in this cartoon from ''[[Puck (magazine)|Puck]]''.]]\nThe [[tariff]] levels had been a major political issue since before the Civil War, and they became the most dominant matter of the 1888 election.{{sfn|Socolofsky & Spetter|p=51}} The high tariff rates had created a surplus of money in the Treasury, which led many Democrats (as well as the growing Populist movement) to call for lowering them. Most Republicans preferred to maintain the rates, spend the surplus on [[Public works|internal improvements]] and eliminate some internal taxes.{{sfn|Socolofsky & Spetter|p=49}}\n\nRepresentative [[William McKinley]] and Senator [[Nelson W. Aldrich]] framed the [[McKinley Tariff]] that would raise the tariff even higher, including making some rates intentionally prohibitive.{{sfnm|Calhoun|2005|1pp=100\u2013104|Socolofsky & Spetter || 2pp=51\u201352}} At Secretary of State James Blaine's urging, Harrison attempted to make the tariff more acceptable by urging Congress to add [[Reciprocity (international relations)|reciprocity]] provisions, which would allow the president to reduce rates when other countries reduced their rates on American exports.{{sfn|Socolofsky & Spetter|p=51}} The tariff was removed from imported raw [[sugar]], and sugar growers in the United States were given a two cent per pound subsidy on their production.{{sfnm|Calhoun|2005|1pp=100\u2013104|Socolofsky & Spetter || 2pp=51\u201352}} Even with the reductions and reciprocity, the McKinley Tariff enacted the highest average rate in American history, and the spending associated with it contributed to the reputation of the [[51st United States Congress|Billion-Dollar Congress]].{{sfn|Socolofsky & Spetter|p=51}}\n\n===Antitrust laws and the currency===\n[[File:John-Sherman-2.jpg|thumb|left|upright=.75|Senator [[John Sherman]] worked closely with Harrison, writing bills regulating [[Sherman Antitrust Act|monopolies]] and [[Sherman Silver Purchase Act|monetary policy]].]]\nMembers of both parties were concerned with the growth of the power of [[Trust (19th century)|trusts]] and [[Monopoly|monopolies]], and one of the first acts of the [[51st United States Congress|51st Congress]] was to pass the [[Sherman Antitrust Act]], sponsored by Senator [[John Sherman]] of Ohio. The Act passed by wide margins in both houses, and Harrison signed it into law.{{sfn|Socolofsky & Spetter|p=53}} The Sherman Act was the first Federal act of its kind, and marked a new use of federal government power.{{sfn|Calhoun|2005|pp=92\u201393}} While Harrison approved of the law and its intent, his administration was not particularly vigorous in enforcing it.{{sfnm|Socolofsky & Spetter || 1p=54|Calhoun|2005|2p=94}} However, the government successfully concluded a case during Harrison's time in office (against a Tennessee coal company),{{efn|name=coal case}} and had initiated several other cases against trusts.{{sfnm|Socolofsky & Spetter || 1p=54|Calhoun|2005|2p=94}}\n\nOne of the most volatile questions of the 1880s was whether the currency should be backed by [[Bimetallism|gold and silver]], or by [[gold standard|gold alone]].{{sfn|Calhoun|2005|pp=94\u201395}} The issue cut across party lines, with western Republicans and southern Democrats joining together in the call for the free coinage of silver, and both parties' representatives in the northeast holding firm for the gold standard. Because silver was worth less than its legal equivalent in gold, taxpayers paid their government bills in silver, while international creditors demanded payment in gold, resulting in a depletion of the nation's gold supply. Owing to worldwide [[deflation]] in the late 19th century, however, a strict gold standard had resulted in reduction of incomes without the equivalent reduction in debts, pushing debtors and the poor to call for silver coinage as an inflationary measure.{{sfnm|Calhoun|2005|1pp=94\u201395|Socolofsky & Spetter || 2pp=55\u201359}}\n\nThe silver coinage issue had not been much discussed in the 1888 campaign and Harrison is said to have favored a bimetallist position.{{sfn|Socolofsky & Spetter|p=53}} However, his appointment of a silverite Treasury Secretary, [[William Windom]], encouraged the free silver supporters.{{sfn|Socolofsky & Spetter|pp=56\u201357}} Harrison attempted to steer a middle course between the two positions, advocating a free coinage of silver, but at its own value, not at a fixed ratio to gold.{{sfnm|Socolofsky & Spetter || 1p=58|Calhoun|2005|2p=96}} This failed to facilitate a compromise between the factions. In July 1890, Senator Sherman achieved passage of a bill, the [[Sherman Silver Purchase Act]], in both houses.{{sfnm|Socolofsky & Spetter || 1p=58|Calhoun|2005|2p=96}} Harrison thought that the bill would end the controversy, and he signed it into law.{{sfn|Socolofsky & Spetter|p=59}} The effect of the bill, however, was the increased depletion of the nation's gold supply, a problem that would persist until the second Cleveland administration [[Grover Cleveland#Economic panic and the silver issue|resolved it]].{{sfn|Socolofsky & Spetter|p=60}}\n{{clear}}\n\n===Civil rights===\n[[File:President Benjamin Harrison on ship.jpg|thumb|Harrison with Secretary Blaine and Representative [[Henry Cabot Lodge]] off the coast of [[Maine]], 1889]]\nAfter regaining the majority in both Houses of Congress, some Republicans, led by Harrison, attempted to pass legislation to protect black Americans' civil rights. Harrison's Attorney General, [[William H. H. Miller]], through the Justice Department, ordered the prosecutions for violation of voting rights in the South; however, white juries often failed to convict or indict violators. This prompted Harrison to urge Congress to pass legislation that would \"secure all our people a free exercise of the right of suffrage and every other civil right under the Constitution and laws\".{{sfn|Calhoun|2005|pp=89\u201390}} Harrison endorsed the proposed [[Lodge Bill|Federal Elections Bill]] written by Representative [[Henry Cabot Lodge]] and Senator [[George Frisbie Hoar]] in 1890, but the bill was defeated in the Senate.{{sfn|Wilson|pp=32\u201333}} Following the failure to pass the bill, Harrison continued to speak in favor of [[African American]] civil rights in addresses to Congress. Most notably, on December 3, 1889, Harrison had gone before Congress and stated:\n\n<blockquote>The colored people did not intrude themselves upon us; they were brought here in chains and held in communities where they are now chiefly bound by a cruel slave code...when and under what conditions is the black man to have a free ballot? When is he in fact to have those full civil rights which have so long been his in law? When is that quality of influence which our form of government was intended to secure to the electors to be restored? \u2026 in many parts of our country where the colored population is large the people of that race are by various devices deprived of any effective exercise of their political rights and of many of their civil rights. The wrong does not expend itself upon those whose votes are suppressed. Every constituency in the Union is wronged.{{sfn|Socolofsky & Spetter|p=62}}</blockquote>\n\nHe severely questioned the states' civil rights records, arguing that if states have the authority over civil rights, then \"we have a right to ask whether they are at work upon it.\"{{sfn|Wilson|pp=32\u201333}} Harrison also supported a bill proposed by Senator [[Henry W. Blair]], which would have granted federal funding to schools regardless of the students' races.{{sfn|Socolofsky & Spetter|pp=65\u201367}} He also endorsed a proposed constitutional amendment to overturn the Supreme Court ruling in the ''[[Civil Rights Cases]]'' (1883) that declared much of the [[Civil Rights Act of 1875]] unconstitutional. None of these measures gained congressional approval.{{sfnm|Calhoun|2005|1pp=89\u201390|Smith || 2p=170}}\n\n===National forests===\nIn March 1891 Congress enacted, and Harrison signed, the [[Land Revision Act of 1891]]. This legislation resulted from a bipartisan desire to initiate [[land reclamation|reclamation]] of surplus lands that had been, up to that point, granted from the public domain, for potential settlement or use by railroad syndicates. As the law's drafting was finalized, Section 24 was added at the behest of Harrison by his Secretary of the Interior John Noble, which read as follows:\n<blockquote>That the President of the United States may, from time to time, set apart and reserve, in any State or Territory having public land bearing forests, in any part of the public lands wholly or in part covered with timber or undergrowth, whether of commercial value or not, as public reservations, and the president shall, by public proclamation, declare the establishment of such reservations and the limits thereof.{{sfn|Socolofsky & Spetter|p=71}}</blockquote>\n\nWithin a month of the enactment of this law Harrison authorized the first forest reserve, to be located on public domain adjacent to Yellowstone Park, in Wyoming. Other areas were so designated by Harrison, bringing the first forest reservations total to 22&nbsp;million acres in his term.{{sfn|Socolofsky & Spetter|p=72}} Harrison was also the first to give a prehistoric Indian Ruin, Casa Grande in Arizona, federal protection.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.presidentbenjaminharrison.org/learn/benjamin-harrison-1/president|title=President|last=Administrator|first=Joomla!|website=www.presidentbenjaminharrison.org|access-date=September 18, 2016}}</ref>\n\n===Native American policy===\nDuring Harrison's administration, the [[Lakota Sioux]], previously confined to reservations in South Dakota, grew restive under the influence of [[Wovoka]], a medicine man, who encouraged them to participate in a spiritual movement called the [[Ghost Dance]].{{sfn|Socolofsky & Spetter|p=106}} Many in Washington did not understand the predominantly religious nature of the Ghost Dance, and thought it was a militant movement being used to rally Native Americans against the government. On December 29, 1890, troops from the [[7th Cavalry Regiment (United States)|Seventh Cavalry]] clashed with the Sioux at [[Wounded Knee Massacre|Wounded Knee]]. The result was a massacre of at least 146 Sioux, including many women and children; the dead Sioux were buried in a mass grave.{{sfn|Moore|Hale|2006|pp=121\u2013122}}{{sfn|Socolofsky & Spetter || pp=106\u2013107}} In reaction Harrison directed Major General [[Nelson A.

Harrison was the earliest president whose voice is known to be preserved. That {{Audio|Benjamin Harrison speech.ogg| thirty-six-second recording}} was originally made on a wax [[phonograph cylinder]] in 1889 by [[Gianni Bettini]].<ref name=\"Vincent Voice Library\" /> Harrison also had electricity installed in the White House for the first time by [[General Electric|Edison General Electric Company]], but he and his wife would not touch the light switches for fear of electrocution and would often go to sleep with the lights on.{{sfn|Moore|Hale|2006|p=96}}\n\nOver the course of his administration, Harrison marshaled the country's technology to clothe the nation with a credible naval power. When he took office there were only two commissioned warships in the Navy. In his inaugural address he said, \"construction of a sufficient number of warships and their necessary armaments should progress as rapidly as is consistent with care and perfection.\"{{sfn|Socolofsky & Spetter|p=97}} Harrison's Secretary of the Navy [[Benjamin F.

By 1898, with the help of the Carnegie Corporation, no less than ten modern warships, including steel hulls and greater displacements and armaments, had transformed the United States into a legitimate naval power. Seven of these had begun during the Harrison term.{{sfn|Socolofsky & Spetter|p=102}}\n\n===Foreign policy===\n====Latin America and Samoa====\nHarrison and [[United States Secretary of State|Secretary of State]] Blaine were often not the most cordial of friends, but harmonized in an aggressive foreign policy and commercial reciprocity with other nations.{{sfn|Calhoun|2005|pp=74\u201376}} Blaine's persistent medical problems warranted more of a hands-on effort by Harrison in the conduct of foreign policy. In [[San Francisco]], while on tour of the United States in 1891, Harrison proclaimed that the United States was in a \"new epoch\" of trade and that the expanding navy would protect oceanic shipping and increase American influence and prestige abroad.{{sfn|Calhoun|2005|pp=119\u2013121}} The [[First International Conference of American States]] met in [[Washington, D.C.|Washington]] in 1889; Harrison set an aggressive agenda including customs and currency integration and named a bipartisan delegation to the conference, led by [[John B. Henderson]] and [[Andrew Carnegie]]. The conference failed to achieve any diplomatic breakthrough, due in large part to an atmosphere of suspicion fostered by the Argentinian delegation. It did succeed in establishing an information center that became the [[Organization of American States|Pan American Union]].{{sfn|Moore|Hale|2006|p=108}} In response to the diplomatic bust, Harrison and Blaine pivoted diplomatically and initiated a crusade for tariff reciprocity with Latin American nations; the Harrison administration concluded eight reciprocity treaties among these countries.{{sfn|Socolofsky & Spetter|pp=117\u2013120}} On another front, Harrison sent [[Frederick Douglass]] as ambassador to [[Haiti]], but failed in his attempts to establish a naval base there.{{sfn|Socolofsky & Spetter|pp=126\u2013128}}\n\nIn 1889, the United States, the United Kingdom, and the [[German Empire]] were locked in a dispute over control of the Samoan Islands. Historian George H. Ryden's research indicates Harrison played a key role in determining the status of this Pacific outpost by taking a firm stand on every aspect of Samoa conference negotiations; this included selection of the local ruler, refusal to allow an indemnity for Germany, as well as the establishment of a three power protectorate, a first for the U.S.. These arrangements facilitated the future dominant power of the U.S. in the Pacific; Secretary of State Blaine was absent due to complication of [[Low back pain|lumbago]].{{sfn|Socolofsky & Spetter|pp=115\u2013116}}\n\n====European embargo of U.S. pork====\nThroughout the 1880s various European countries had imposed a ban on importation of United States pork out of an unconfirmed concern of [[trichinosis]]; at issue was over one billion pounds of pork products with a value of $80&nbsp;million annually (equivalent to ${{Inflation|US|.08|1885|r=1}}&nbsp;billion in {{Inflation/year|US}}). Harrison engaged Whitelaw Reid, minister to France, and [[William Walter Phelps]], minister to Germany, to restore these exports for the country without delay. Harrison also successfully asked the congress to enact the Meat Inspection Act to eliminate the accusations of product compromise. The president also partnered with Agriculture Secretary Rusk to threaten Germany with retaliation \u2013 by initiating an embargo in the U.S. against Germany's highly demanded beet sugar. By September 1891 Germany relented, and was soon followed by Denmark, France and Austria-Hungary.{{sfn|Socolofsky & Spetter|pp=131\u2013136}}\n\n====Crises in Aleutian Islands and Chile====\nThe first international crisis Harrison faced arose from disputed fishing rights on the [[Alaska]]n coast. [[Canada]] claimed fishing and [[Seal hunting|sealing]] rights around many of the [[Aleutian Islands]], in violation of U.S. law. As a result, the [[United States Navy]] seized several Canadian ships.{{sfn|Socolofsky & Spetter|pp=137\u2013138}} In 1891, the administration began negotiations with the British that would eventually lead to a compromise over fishing rights after international arbitration, with the British government paying compensation in 1898.{{sfn|Moore|Hale|2006|pp=135\u2013136}}{{sfn|Socolofsky & Spetter || pp=139\u2013143}}\n\nIn 1891, a diplomatic crisis emerged in [[Chile]], otherwise known as the [[Baltimore Crisis|''Baltimore'' Crisis]]. The American minister to Chile, [[Patrick Egan (land reformer and diplomat)|Patrick Egan]], granted asylum to Chileans who were seeking refuge during the [[1891 Chilean Civil War]]. Egan, previously a militant Irish immigrant to the U.S., was motivated by a personal desire to thwart Great Britain's influence in Chile;{{sfn|Socolofsky & Spetter|p=146}} his action increased tensions between Chile and the United States, which began in the early 1880s when Secretary Blaine had alienated the Chileans in the [[War of the Pacific]].\n[[File:Uss baltimore c-3.jpg|thumb|Attack on sailors from {{USS|Baltimore|C-3|6}} spawned the 1891 Chilean crisis.]]\nThe crisis began in earnest when sailors from {{USS|Baltimore|C-3|6}} took [[shore leave]] in [[Valparaiso]] and a fight ensued, resulting in the deaths of two American sailors and the arrest of three dozen others.{{sfn|Calhoun|2005|p=127}} ''Baltimore''{{'}}s captain, Winfield Schley, based on the nature of the sailors' wounds, insisted the sailors had been bayonet-attacked by Chilean police without provocation. With Blaine incapacitated, Harrison drafted a demand for reparations. The Chilean Minister of Foreign Affairs Manuel Matta replied that Harrison's message was \"erroneous or deliberately incorrect,\" and said that the Chilean government was treating the affair the same as any other criminal matter.{{sfnm|Calhoun|2005|1pp=128\u2013129|Socolofsky & Spetter || 2pp=147\u2013149}}\n\nTensions increased to the brink of war \u2013 Harrison threatened to break off diplomatic relations unless the United States received a suitable apology, and said the situation required, \"grave and patriotic consideration\". The president also remarked, \"If the dignity as well as the prestige and influence of the United States are not to be wholly sacrificed, we must protect those who in foreign ports display the flag or wear the colors.\"{{sfn|Socolofsky & Spetter|p=151}} The Navy was also placed on a high level of preparedness.{{sfnm|Calhoun|2005|1pp=128\u2013129|Socolofsky & Spetter || 2pp=147\u2013149}} A recuperated Blaine made brief conciliatory overtures to the Chilean government which had no support in the administration; he then reversed course, joined the chorus for unconditional concessions and apology by the Chileans, who ultimately obliged, and war was averted. Theodore Roosevelt later applauded Harrison for his use of the \"big stick\" in the matter.{{sfn|Moore|Hale|2006|p=134}}{{sfn|Socolofsky & Spetter|pp=150\u2013151}}\n\n====Annexation of Hawaii====\nIn the last days of his administration, Harrison dealt with the issue of [[Hawaii]]an annexation. Following [[Overthrow of the Kingdom of Hawaii|a coup d'\u00e9tat]] against Queen [[Liliuokalani]], the new government of Hawaii led by [[Sanford B. Dole|Sanford Dole]] petitioned for annexation by the United States.{{sfn|Socolofsky & Spetter|pp=204\u2013205}} Harrison was interested in expanding American influence in Hawaii and in establishing a naval base at [[Pearl Harbor]] but had not previously expressed an opinion on annexing the islands.{{sfn|Calhoun|2005|pp=125\u2013126}} The United States [[Consul (representative)|consul]] in Hawaii, [[John L. Stevens]], recognized the new government on February 1, 1893, and forwarded their proposals to Washington. With just one month left before leaving office, the administration signed a treaty on February 14 and submitted it to the Senate the next day with Harrison's recommendation.{{sfn|Socolofsky & Spetter|pp=204\u2013205}} The Senate failed to act, and President Cleveland withdrew the treaty shortly after taking office.{{sfn|Calhoun|2005|p=132}}{{sfn|Moore|Hale|2006|p=147}}\n\n===Cabinet===\n[[File:BHarrison cabinet.jpg|thumb|Harrison's cabinet in 1889<br />Front row, left to right: '''Harrison''', [[William Windom]], [[John Wanamaker]], [[Redfield Proctor]], [[James G.

The first was [[David Josiah Brewer]], a judge on the [[United States Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit|Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit]]. Brewer, the nephew of Justice [[Stephen Johnson Field|Field]], had previously been considered for a cabinet position. Shortly after Brewer's nomination, Justice [[Stanley Matthews (lawyer)|Matthews]] died, creating another vacancy. Harrison had considered [[Henry Billings Brown]], a [[Michigan]] judge and [[admiralty law]] expert, for the first vacancy and now nominated him for the second. For the third vacancy, which arose in 1892, Harrison nominated [[George Shiras Jr.|George Shiras]]. Shiras's appointment was somewhat controversial because his age\u2014sixty\u2014was older than usual for a newly appointed Justice. Shiras also drew the opposition of Senator [[Matthew Quay]] of Pennsylvania because they were in different factions of the Pennsylvania Republican party, but his nomination was nonetheless approved. Finally, at the end of his term, Harrison nominated [[Howell Edmunds Jackson]] to replace Justice [[Lucius Quintus Cincinnatus Lamar (II)|Lamar]], who died in January 1893. Harrison knew the incoming Senate would be controlled by Democrats, so he selected Jackson, a respected Tennessee Democrat with whom he was friendly to ensure his nominee would not be rejected. Jackson's nomination was indeed successful, but he died after only two years on the Court.{{sfn|Socolofsky & Spetter|pp=188\u2013190}}\n\nIn addition to his Supreme Court appointments, Harrison appointed ten judges to the [[United States court of appeals|courts of appeals]], two judges to the [[United States circuit court|circuit courts]], and 26 judges to the [[United States district court|district courts]].\n\n===States admitted to the Union===\nSix new states were [[Admission to the Union|admitted to the Union]] while Harrison was in office:{{sfn|Socolofsky & Spetter|pp=44\u201345}}\n* [[North Dakota]]{{spaced ndash}}[[Enabling Act of 1889|November 2, 1889]]\n* [[South Dakota]]{{spaced ndash}}[[Enabling Act of 1889|November 2, 1889]]\n* [[Montana]]{{spaced ndash}}[[Enabling Act of 1889|November 8, 1889]]\n* [[Washington (state)|Washington]]{{spaced ndash}}[[Enabling Act of 1889|November 11, 1889]]\n* [[Idaho]]{{spaced ndash}}July 3, 1890\n* [[Wyoming]]{{spaced ndash}}July 10, 1890\nMore states were admitted during Harrison's presidency than any other.\n\n===Vacations and travel===\nHarrison attended a grand, three-day [[Legacy of George Washington#Centennial celebration|centennial celebration]] of George Washington's inauguration in [[New York City]] on April 30, 1889, and made the following remarks \"We have come into the serious but always inspiring presence of Washington. He was the incarnation of duty and he teaches us today this great lesson: that those who would associate their names with events that shall outlive a century can only do so by high consecration to duty. Self-seeking has no public observance or anniversary.\"{{sfn|Socolofsky & Spetter|p=160}}\n\nThe Harrisons made many trips out of the capital, which included speeches at most stops \u2013 including Philadelphia, New England, Indianapolis and Chicago. The President typically made his best impression speaking before large audiences, as opposed to more intimate settings.{{sfn|Socolofsky & Spetter|p=157}} The most notable of his presidential trips, theretofore unequaled, was a five-week tour of the west in the spring of 1891, aboard a lavishly outfitted train.{{sfn|Socolofsky & Spetter|p=171}} Harrison enjoyed a number of short trips out of the capital\u2014usually for hunting\u2014to nearby Virginia or Maryland.{{sfn|Socolofsky & Spetter|p=166}}\n\nDuring the hot Washington summers, the Harrisons took refuge in [[Deer Park, Maryland]] and [[Cape May Point, New Jersey]]. In 1890, John Wanamaker joined with other Philadelphia devotees of the Harrisons and made a gift to them of a summer cottage at Cape May. Harrison, though appreciative, was uncomfortable with the appearance of impropriety; a month later, he paid Wanamaker $10,000 ({{Inflation|US|10000|1890|fmt=eq}}) as reimbursement to the donors. Nevertheless, Harrison's opponents made the gift the subject of national ridicule, and Mrs. Harrison and the president were vigorously criticized.{{sfn|Socolofsky & Spetter|p=168}}\n\n===Reelection campaign in 1892===\n{{main|1892 United States presidential election}}\n[[File:Eastman Johnson - Benjamin Harrison - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|upright=.6|Official [[White House]] portrait of Benjamin Harrison, painted by [[Eastman Johnson]]]]\nThe treasury surplus had evaporated and the nation's economic health was worsening \u2013 precursors to the eventual [[Panic of 1893]].{{sfn|Calhoun|2005|pp=107, 126\u2013127}} Congressional elections in 1890 had gone against the Republicans; and although Harrison had cooperated with Congressional Republicans on legislation, several party leaders withdrew their support for him because of his adamant refusal to give party members the nod in the course of his executive appointments. Specifically, Thomas C. Platt, Matthew S. Quay, Thomas B. Reed and James Clarkson quietly organized the Grievance Committee, the ambition of which was to initiate a dump-Harrison offensive. They solicited the support of Blaine, without effect however, and Harrison in reaction resolved to run for re-election \u2013 seemingly forced to choose one of two options \u2013 \"become a candidate or forever wear the name of a political coward\".{{sfn|Socolofsky & Spetter|p=81}}\n\nIt was clear that Harrison would not be re-nominated unanimously.{{sfn|Calhoun|2005|pp=134\u2013137}} Many of Harrison's detractors persisted in pushing for an incapacitated Blaine, though he announced that he was not a candidate in February 1892.{{sfn|Calhoun|2005|pp=134\u2013137}} Some party leaders still hoped to draft Blaine into running, and speculation increased when he resigned at the 11th hour as Secretary of State in June.{{sfn|Calhoun|2005|pp=138\u2013139}} At the [[1892 Republican National Convention|convention]] in [[Minneapolis]], Harrison prevailed on the first ballot, but encountered significant opposition.{{sfn|Calhoun|2005|pp=140\u2013141}}\n\nThe Democrats renominated former President Cleveland, making the 1892 election a rematch of the one four years earlier.

Historians have often given Secretary of State Blaine credit for foreign-policy initiatives. However, Calhoun argues that Harrison was even more responsible for the success of trade negotiations, the buildup of the steel Navy, overseas expansion, and emphasis on the American role in dominating the hemisphere through the Monroe Doctrine. The major weakness which Calhoun sees was that the public and indeed the grassroots Republican Party was not fully prepared for this onslaught of major activity. The Democrats scored a sweeping landslide in 1890 by attacking the flagship legislation, especially the McKinley tariff, because it would raise the cost of living of the average American family. McKinley himself was defeated for reelection.<ref>Charles Calhoun, ''Benjamin Harrison'' (2005).</ref><ref>Charles Calhoun, \"Reimagining the \"Lost Men\" of the Gilded Age: Perspectives on the Late Nineteenth Century Presidents\".

Hal Williams, Harrison had a \"widespread reputation for personal and official integrity\". Closely scrutinized by Democrats, Harrison's reputation was largely intact when he left the White House. Having an advantage few 19th-century presidents had, Harrison's own party, the Republicans, controlled Congress, while his administration actively advanced a Republican program of a higher tariff, moderate control of corporations, protecting [[African American]] voting rights, a generous Civil War pension, and compromising over the controversial [[bimetallism|silver issue]]. Historians have not raised \"serious questions about Harrison's own integrity or the integrity of his administration\". {{sfn|Williams|p=191}}\n\nFollowing the [[Panic of 1893]], Harrison became more popular in retirement.{{sfn|Calhoun|2005|p=6}} His legacy among historians is scant, and \"general accounts of his period inaccurately treat Harrison as a cipher\".{{sfn|Socolofsky & Spetter|p=x}} More recently,\n<blockquote>historians have recognized the importance of the Harrison administration\u2014and Harrison himself\u2014in the new foreign policy of the late nineteenth century.

He was a grandson of the ninth president, [[William Henry Harrison]], creating the only grandfather{{endash}}grandson duo to have held the office. He was also a great-grandson of [[Benjamin Harrison V]], a [[Founding Fathers of the United States|founding father]] who signed the [[United States Declaration of Independence]]. \n\nHarrison was born on a farm by the [[Ohio River]] and graduated from Miami University in Oxford, Ohio.  After moving to [[Indianapolis]], Harrison established himself as a prominent local attorney, Presbyterian church leader, and politician in [[Indiana]]. During the [[American Civil War]], he served in the [[Union Army]] as a [[Colonel (United States)|colonel]], and was confirmed by the [[United States Senate|U.S. Senate]] as a [[Brevet (military)|brevet]] [[Brigadier general (United States)|brigadier general]] of volunteers in 1865. Harrison unsuccessfully ran for [[governor of Indiana]] in 1876. The [[Indiana General Assembly]] elected Harrison to a six-year term in the [[United States Senate|U.S. Senate]], where he served from 1881 to 1887.\n\nA [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]], Harrison was elected to the presidency in [[1888 United States presidential election|1888]], defeating the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic]] incumbent, [[Grover Cleveland]]. Hallmarks of Harrison's administration included unprecedented economic legislation, including the [[McKinley Tariff]], which imposed historic protective trade rates, and the [[Sherman Antitrust Act]]. Harrison also facilitated the creation of the [[United States National Forest|national forest reserves]] through an amendment to the Land Revision Act of 1891. During his administration six western states were admitted to the Union. In addition, Harrison substantially strengthened and modernized the [[United States Navy|U.S. Navy]] and conducted an active foreign policy, but his proposals to secure federal education funding as well as voting rights enforcement for [[African Americans]] were unsuccessful.\n\nDue in large part to surplus revenues from the tariffs, federal spending reached one billion dollars for the first time during his term. The spending issue in part led to the defeat of the Republicans in the [[1890 United States House election|1890 mid-term elections]]. Cleveland defeated Harrison for re-election in [[1892 United States presidential election|1892]], due to the growing unpopularity of the high tariff and high federal spending. Harrison returned to private life and his law practice in Indianapolis. In 1899 Harrison represented the [[Republic of Venezuela]] in their [[British Guiana]] boundary dispute against the [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland|United Kingdom]]. Harrison traveled to the court of [[Paris]] as part of the case and after a brief stay returned to Indianapolis. He died at his home in Indianapolis in 1901 of complications from [[influenza]]. Although many have praised Harrison's commitment to African Americans' voting rights, scholars and historians generally regard his administration as below-average, and [[Historical rankings of Presidents of the United States|rank him in the bottom half]] among U.S. presidents.

Harrison had campaigned as a supporter of the [[merit system]], as opposed to the [[spoils system]].{{sfn|Socolofsky & Spetter|p=32}} Although some of the civil service had been classified under the [[Pendleton Civil Service Reform Act|Pendleton Act]] by previous administrations, Harrison spent much of his first months in office deciding on political appointments.{{sfn|Socolofsky & Spetter|pp=32\u201336}} Congress was widely divided on the issue and Harrison was reluctant to address the issue in hope of preventing the alienation of either side. The issue became a [[political football]] of the time and was immortalized in a cartoon captioned \"What can I do when both parties insist on kicking?\"{{sfn|Moore|Hale|2006|pp=83, 86}} Harrison appointed [[Theodore Roosevelt]] and [[Hugh Smith Thompson]], both reformers, to the [[United States Civil Service Commission|Civil Service Commission]], but otherwise did little to further the reform cause.{{sfn|Socolofsky & Spetter|pp=39\u201341}}\n\n[[File:Harrison Football Political Cartoon.jpg|thumb|left|[[Political football]]]]\n\nHarrison quickly saw the enactment of the [[Dependent and Disability Pension Act]] in 1890, a cause he had championed while in Congress. In addition to providing pensions to disabled Civil War veterans (regardless of the cause of their disability), the Act depleted some of the troublesome federal budget surplus. Pension expenditures reached $135&nbsp;million under Harrison (equivalent to ${{Inflation|US|.135|1893|r=1}}&nbsp;billion in {{Inflation/year|US}}), the largest expenditure of its kind to that point in American history, a problem exacerbated by [[Pension Bureau]] commissioner [[James R. Tanner]]'s expansive interpretation of the pension laws.{{sfnm|Socolofsky & Spetter || 1pp=36\u201337|Calhoun|2005|2pp=72\u201373}} An investigation into the Pension Bureau by Harrison's Secretary of Interior [[John Willock Noble]] found evidence of lavish and illegal handouts under Tanner.{{sfn|Williams|p=193}} Harrison, who privately believed that appointing Tanner had been a mistake, due to his apparent loose management style and tongue, asked Tanner to resign and replaced him with [[Green Berry Raum|Green B. Raum]].{{sfn|Socolofsky & Spetter|pp=34\u201336}} Raum was also accused of accepting loan payments in return for expediting pension cases. Harrison, having accepted a dissenting Congressional Republican investigation report that exonerated Raum, kept him in office for the rest of his administration.{{sfn|Williams|pp=193\u2013194}}\n\nOne of the first appointments Harrison was forced to reverse was that of James S. Clarkson as an assistant postmaster. Clarkson, who had expected a full cabinet position, began sabotaging the appointment from the outset, gaining the reputation for \"decapitating a fourth class postmaster every three minutes\". Clarkson himself stated, \"I am simply on detail from the Republican Committee&nbsp;... I am most anxious to get through this task and leave.\" He resigned in September 1890.{{sfn|Socolofsky & Spetter|pp=34\u201336}}\n\n===Tariff===\n[[File:Billion dollar Congress.jpg|thumb|upright=.75|Harrison and the [[51st United States Congress|Billion-Dollar Congress]] are portrayed as wasting the surplus in this cartoon from ''[[Puck (magazine)|Puck]]''.]]\nThe [[tariff]] levels had been a major political issue since before the Civil War, and they became the most dominant matter of the 1888 election.{{sfn|Socolofsky & Spetter|p=51}} The high tariff rates had created a surplus of money in the Treasury, which led many Democrats (as well as the growing Populist movement) to call for lowering them. Most Republicans preferred to maintain the rates, spend the surplus on [[Public works|internal improvements]] and eliminate some internal taxes.{{sfn|Socolofsky & Spetter|p=49}}\n\nRepresentative [[William McKinley]] and Senator [[Nelson W. Aldrich]] framed the [[McKinley Tariff]] that would raise the tariff even higher, including making some rates intentionally prohibitive.{{sfnm|Calhoun|2005|1pp=100\u2013104|Socolofsky & Spetter || 2pp=51\u201352}} At Secretary of State James Blaine's urging, Harrison attempted to make the tariff more acceptable by urging Congress to add [[Reciprocity (international relations)|reciprocity]] provisions, which would allow the president to reduce rates when other countries reduced their rates on American exports.{{sfn|Socolofsky & Spetter|p=51}} The tariff was removed from imported raw [[sugar]], and sugar growers in the United States were given a two cent per pound subsidy on their production.{{sfnm|Calhoun|2005|1pp=100\u2013104|Socolofsky & Spetter || 2pp=51\u201352}} Even with the reductions and reciprocity, the McKinley Tariff enacted the highest average rate in American history, and the spending associated with it contributed to the reputation of the [[51st United States Congress|Billion-Dollar Congress]].{{sfn|Socolofsky & Spetter|p=51}}\n\n===Antitrust laws and the currency===\n[[File:John-Sherman-2.jpg|thumb|left|upright=.75|Senator [[John Sherman]] worked closely with Harrison, writing bills regulating [[Sherman Antitrust Act|monopolies]] and [[Sherman Silver Purchase Act|monetary policy]].]]\nMembers of both parties were concerned with the growth of the power of [[Trust (19th century)|trusts]] and [[Monopoly|monopolies]], and one of the first acts of the [[51st United States Congress|51st Congress]] was to pass the [[Sherman Antitrust Act]], sponsored by Senator [[John Sherman]] of Ohio. The Act passed by wide margins in both houses, and Harrison signed it into law.{{sfn|Socolofsky & Spetter|p=53}} The Sherman Act was the first Federal act of its kind, and marked a new use of federal government power.{{sfn|Calhoun|2005|pp=92\u201393}} While Harrison approved of the law and its intent, his administration was not particularly vigorous in enforcing it.{{sfnm|Socolofsky & Spetter || 1p=54|Calhoun|2005|2p=94}} However, the government successfully concluded a case during Harrison's time in office (against a Tennessee coal company),{{efn|name=coal case}} and had initiated several other cases against trusts.{{sfnm|Socolofsky & Spetter || 1p=54|Calhoun|2005|2p=94}}\n\nOne of the most volatile questions of the 1880s was whether the currency should be backed by [[Bimetallism|gold and silver]], or by [[gold standard|gold alone]].{{sfn|Calhoun|2005|pp=94\u201395}} The issue cut across party lines, with western Republicans and southern Democrats joining together in the call for the free coinage of silver, and both parties' representatives in the northeast holding firm for the gold standard. Because silver was worth less than its legal equivalent in gold, taxpayers paid their government bills in silver, while international creditors demanded payment in gold, resulting in a depletion of the nation's gold supply. Owing to worldwide [[deflation]] in the late 19th century, however, a strict gold standard had resulted in reduction of incomes without the equivalent reduction in debts, pushing debtors and the poor to call for silver coinage as an inflationary measure.{{sfnm|Calhoun|2005|1pp=94\u201395|Socolofsky & Spetter || 2pp=55\u201359}}\n\nThe silver coinage issue had not been much discussed in the 1888 campaign and Harrison is said to have favored a bimetallist position.{{sfn|Socolofsky & Spetter|p=53}} However, his appointment of a silverite Treasury Secretary, [[William Windom]], encouraged the free silver supporters.{{sfn|Socolofsky & Spetter|pp=56\u201357}} Harrison attempted to steer a middle course between the two positions, advocating a free coinage of silver, but at its own value, not at a fixed ratio to gold.{{sfnm|Socolofsky & Spetter || 1p=58|Calhoun|2005|2p=96}} This failed to facilitate a compromise between the factions. In July 1890, Senator Sherman achieved passage of a bill, the [[Sherman Silver Purchase Act]], in both houses.{{sfnm|Socolofsky & Spetter || 1p=58|Calhoun|2005|2p=96}} Harrison thought that the bill would end the controversy, and he signed it into law.{{sfn|Socolofsky & Spetter|p=59}} The effect of the bill, however, was the increased depletion of the nation's gold supply, a problem that would persist until the second Cleveland administration [[Grover Cleveland#Economic panic and the silver issue|resolved it]].{{sfn|Socolofsky & Spetter|p=60}}\n{{clear}}\n\n===Civil rights===\n[[File:President Benjamin Harrison on ship.jpg|thumb|Harrison with Secretary Blaine and Representative [[Henry Cabot Lodge]] off the coast of [[Maine]], 1889]]\nAfter regaining the majority in both Houses of Congress, some Republicans, led by Harrison, attempted to pass legislation to protect black Americans' civil rights. Harrison's Attorney General, [[William H. H. Miller]], through the Justice Department, ordered the prosecutions for violation of voting rights in the South; however, white juries often failed to convict or indict violators. This prompted Harrison to urge Congress to pass legislation that would \"secure all our people a free exercise of the right of suffrage and every other civil right under the Constitution and laws\".{{sfn|Calhoun|2005|pp=89\u201390}} Harrison endorsed the proposed [[Lodge Bill|Federal Elections Bill]] written by Representative [[Henry Cabot Lodge]] and Senator [[George Frisbie Hoar]] in 1890, but the bill was defeated in the Senate.{{sfn|Wilson|pp=32\u201333}} Following the failure to pass the bill, Harrison continued to speak in favor of [[African American]] civil rights in addresses to Congress. Most notably, on December 3, 1889, Harrison had gone before Congress and stated:\n\n<blockquote>The colored people did not intrude themselves upon us; they were brought here in chains and held in communities where they are now chiefly bound by a cruel slave code...when and under what conditions is the black man to have a free ballot? When is he in fact to have those full civil rights which have so long been his in law? When is that quality of influence which our form of government was intended to secure to the electors to be restored? \u2026 in many parts of our country where the colored population is large the people of that race are by various devices deprived of any effective exercise of their political rights and of many of their civil rights. The wrong does not expend itself upon those whose votes are suppressed. Every constituency in the Union is wronged.{{sfn|Socolofsky & Spetter|p=62}}</blockquote>\n\nHe severely questioned the states' civil rights records, arguing that if states have the authority over civil rights, then \"we have a right to ask whether they are at work upon it.\"{{sfn|Wilson|pp=32\u201333}} Harrison also supported a bill proposed by Senator [[Henry W. Blair]], which would have granted federal funding to schools regardless of the students' races.{{sfn|Socolofsky & Spetter|pp=65\u201367}} He also endorsed a proposed constitutional amendment to overturn the Supreme Court ruling in the ''[[Civil Rights Cases]]'' (1883) that declared much of the [[Civil Rights Act of 1875]] unconstitutional. None of these measures gained congressional approval.{{sfnm|Calhoun|2005|1pp=89\u201390|Smith || 2p=170}}\n\n===National forests===\nIn March 1891 Congress enacted, and Harrison signed, the [[Land Revision Act of 1891]]. This legislation resulted from a bipartisan desire to initiate [[land reclamation|reclamation]] of surplus lands that had been, up to that point, granted from the public domain, for potential settlement or use by railroad syndicates. As the law's drafting was finalized, Section 24 was added at the behest of Harrison by his Secretary of the Interior John Noble, which read as follows:\n<blockquote>That the President of the United States may, from time to time, set apart and reserve, in any State or Territory having public land bearing forests, in any part of the public lands wholly or in part covered with timber or undergrowth, whether of commercial value or not, as public reservations, and the president shall, by public proclamation, declare the establishment of such reservations and the limits thereof.{{sfn|Socolofsky & Spetter|p=71}}</blockquote>\n\nWithin a month of the enactment of this law Harrison authorized the first forest reserve, to be located on public domain adjacent to Yellowstone Park, in Wyoming. Other areas were so designated by Harrison, bringing the first forest reservations total to 22 million acres in his term.{{sfn|Socolofsky & Spetter|p=72}} Harrison was also the first to give a prehistoric Indian Ruin, Casa Grande in Arizona, federal protection.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.presidentbenjaminharrison.org/learn/benjamin-harrison-1/president|title=President|last=Administrator|first=Joomla!|website=www.presidentbenjaminharrison.org|access-date=September 18, 2016}}</ref>\n\n===Native American policy===\nDuring Harrison's administration, the [[Lakota Sioux]], previously confined to reservations in South Dakota, grew restive under the influence of [[Wovoka]], a medicine man, who encouraged them to participate in a spiritual movement called the [[Ghost Dance]].{{sfn|Socolofsky & Spetter|p=106}} Many in Washington did not understand the predominantly religious nature of the Ghost Dance, and thought it was a militant movement being used to rally Native Americans against the government. On December 29, 1890, troops from the [[7th Cavalry Regiment (United States)|Seventh Cavalry]] clashed with the Sioux at [[Wounded Knee Massacre|Wounded Knee]]. The result was a massacre of at least 146 Sioux, including many women and children; the dead Sioux were buried in a mass grave.{{sfn|Moore|Hale|2006|pp=121\u2013122}}{{sfn|Socolofsky & Spetter || pp=106\u2013107}} In reaction Harrison directed Major General [[Nelson A. Miles]] to investigate and ordered 3500 federal troops to South Dakota; the uprising was brought to an end.{{sfn|Socolofsky & Spetter|p=106}} Wounded Knee is considered the last major American Indian battle in the 19th century.{{sfn|Moore|Hale|2006|pp=121\u2013122}} Harrison's general policy on American Indians was to encourage assimilation into white society and, despite the massacre, he believed the policy to have been generally successful.{{sfn|Socolofsky & Spetter|p=92}} This policy, known as the [[Allotment Era|allotment system]] and embodied in the [[Dawes Severalty Act|Dawes Act]], was favored by liberal reformers at the time, but eventually proved detrimental to American Indians as they sold most of their land at low prices to white speculators.{{sfnm|Calhoun|2005|1pp=112\u2013114|Stuart || 2pp=452\u2013454}}\n\n===Technology and naval modernization===\n[[File:USS Texas2.jpg|thumb|{{USS|Texas|1892|6}}, America's first battleship, built in 1892]]\nDuring Harrison's time in office, the United States was continuing to experience advances in science and technology. Harrison was the earliest president whose voice is known to be preserved. That {{Audio|Benjamin Harrison speech.ogg| thirty-six-second recording}} was originally made on a wax [[phonograph cylinder]] in 1889 by [[Gianni Bettini]].<ref name=\"Vincent Voice Library\" /> Harrison also had electricity installed in the White House for the first time by [[General Electric|Edison General Electric Company]], but he and his wife would not touch the light switches for fear of electrocution and would often go to sleep with the lights on.{{sfn|Moore|Hale|2006|p=96}}\n\nOver the course of his administration, Harrison marshaled the country's technology to clothe the nation with a credible naval power. When he took office there were only two commissioned warships in the Navy. In his inaugural address he said, \"construction of a sufficient number of warships and their necessary armaments should progress as rapidly as is consistent with care and perfection.\"{{sfn|Socolofsky & Spetter|p=97}} Harrison's Secretary of the Navy [[Benjamin F. Tracy]] spearheaded the rapid construction of vessels, and within a year congressional approval was obtained for building of the warships {{USS|Indiana|BB-1|2}}, {{USS|Texas|1892|2}}, {{USS|Oregon|BB-3|2}}, and {{USS|Columbia|C-12|2}}. By 1898, with the help of the Carnegie Corporation, no less than ten modern warships, including steel hulls and greater displacements and armaments, had transformed the United States into a legitimate naval power. Seven of these had begun during the Harrison term.{{sfn|Socolofsky & Spetter|p=102}}\n\n===Foreign policy===\n====Latin America and Samoa====\nHarrison and [[United States Secretary of State|Secretary of State]] Blaine were often not the most cordial of friends, but harmonized in an aggressive foreign policy and commercial reciprocity with other nations.{{sfn|Calhoun|2005|pp=74\u201376}} Blaine's persistent medical problems warranted more of a hands-on effort by Harrison in the conduct of foreign policy. In [[San Francisco]], while on tour of the United States in 1891, Harrison proclaimed that the United States was in a \"new epoch\" of trade and that the expanding navy would protect oceanic shipping and increase American influence and prestige abroad.{{sfn|Calhoun|2005|pp=119\u2013121}} The [[First International Conference of American States]] met in [[Washington, D.C.|Washington]] in 1889; Harrison set an aggressive agenda including customs and currency integration and named a bipartisan delegation to the conference, led by [[John B. Henderson]] and [[Andrew Carnegie]]. The conference failed to achieve any diplomatic breakthrough, due in large part to an atmosphere of suspicion fostered by the Argentinian delegation. It did succeed in establishing an information center that became the [[Organization of American States|Pan American Union]].{{sfn|Moore|Hale|2006|p=108}} In response to the diplomatic bust, Harrison and Blaine pivoted diplomatically and initiated a crusade for tariff reciprocity with Latin American nations; the Harrison administration concluded eight reciprocity treaties among these countries.{{sfn|Socolofsky & Spetter|pp=117\u2013120}} On another front, Harrison sent [[Frederick Douglass]] as ambassador to [[Haiti]], but failed in his attempts to establish a naval base there.{{sfn|Socolofsky & Spetter|pp=126\u2013128}}\n\nIn 1889, the United States, the United Kingdom, and the [[German Empire]] were locked in a dispute over control of the Samoan Islands. Historian George H. Ryden's research indicates Harrison played a key role in determining the status of this Pacific outpost by taking a firm stand on every aspect of Samoa conference negotiations; this included selection of the local ruler, refusal to allow an indemnity for Germany, as well as the establishment of a three power protectorate, a first for the U.S.. These arrangements facilitated the future dominant power of the U.S. in the Pacific; Secretary of State Blaine was absent due to complication of [[Low back pain|lumbago]].{{sfn|Socolofsky & Spetter|pp=115\u2013116}}\n\n====European embargo of U.S. pork====\nThroughout the 1880s various European countries had imposed a ban on importation of United States pork out of an unconfirmed concern of [[trichinosis]]; at issue was over one billion pounds of pork products with a value of $80 million annually (equivalent to ${{Inflation|US|.08|1885|r=1}}&nbsp;billion in {{Inflation/year|US}}). Harrison engaged Whitelaw Reid, minister to France, and [[William Walter Phelps]], minister to Germany, to restore these exports for the country without delay. Harrison also successfully asked the congress to enact the Meat Inspection Act to eliminate the accusations of product compromise. The president also partnered with Agriculture Secretary Rusk to threaten Germany with retaliation \u2013 by initiating an embargo in the U.S. against Germany's highly demanded beet sugar. By September 1891 Germany relented, and was soon followed by Denmark, France and Austria-Hungary.{{sfn|Socolofsky & Spetter|pp=131\u2013136}}\n\n====Crises in Aleutian Islands and Chile====\nThe first international crisis Harrison faced arose from disputed fishing rights on the [[Alaska]]n coast. [[Canada]] claimed fishing and [[Seal hunting|sealing]] rights around many of the [[Aleutian Islands]], in violation of U.S. law. As a result, the [[United States Navy]] seized several Canadian ships.{{sfn|Socolofsky & Spetter|pp=137\u2013138}} In 1891, the administration began negotiations with the British that would eventually lead to a compromise over fishing rights after international arbitration, with the British government paying compensation in 1898.{{sfn|Moore|Hale|2006|pp=135\u2013136}}{{sfn|Socolofsky & Spetter || pp=139\u2013143}}\n\nIn 1891, a diplomatic crisis emerged in [[Chile]], otherwise known as the [[Baltimore Crisis|''Baltimore'' Crisis]]. The American minister to Chile, [[Patrick Egan (land reformer and diplomat)|Patrick Egan]], granted asylum to Chileans who were seeking refuge during the [[1891 Chilean Civil War]]. Egan, previously a militant Irish immigrant to the U.S., was motivated by a personal desire to thwart Great Britain's influence in Chile;{{sfn|Socolofsky & Spetter|p=146}} his action increased tensions between Chile and the United States, which began in the early 1880s when Secretary Blaine had alienated the Chileans in the [[War of the Pacific]].\n[[File:Uss baltimore c-3.jpg|thumb|Attack on sailors from {{USS|Baltimore|C-3|6}} spawned the 1891 Chilean crisis.]]\nThe crisis began in earnest when sailors from {{USS|Baltimore|C-3|6}} took [[shore leave]] in [[Valparaiso]] and a fight ensued, resulting in the deaths of two American sailors and the arrest of three dozen others.{{sfn|Calhoun|2005|p=127}} ''Baltimore''{{'}}s captain, Winfield Schley, based on the nature of the sailors' wounds, insisted the sailors had been bayonet-attacked by Chilean police without provocation. With Blaine incapacitated, Harrison drafted a demand for reparations. The Chilean Minister of Foreign Affairs Manuel Matta replied that Harrison's message was \"erroneous or deliberately incorrect,\" and said that the Chilean government was treating the affair the same as any other criminal matter.{{sfnm|Calhoun|2005|1pp=128\u2013129|Socolofsky & Spetter || 2pp=147\u2013149}}\n\nTensions increased to the brink of war \u2013 Harrison threatened to break off diplomatic relations unless the United States received a suitable apology, and said the situation required, \"grave and patriotic consideration\". The president also remarked, \"If the dignity as well as the prestige and influence of the United States are not to be wholly sacrificed, we must protect those who in foreign ports display the flag or wear the colors.\"{{sfn|Socolofsky & Spetter|p=151}} The Navy was also placed on a high level of preparedness.{{sfnm|Calhoun|2005|1pp=128\u2013129|Socolofsky & Spetter || 2pp=147\u2013149}} A recuperated Blaine made brief conciliatory overtures to the Chilean government which had no support in the administration; he then reversed course, joined the chorus for unconditional concessions and apology by the Chileans, who ultimately obliged, and war was averted. Theodore Roosevelt later applauded Harrison for his use of the \"big stick\" in the matter.{{sfn|Moore|Hale|2006|p=134}}{{sfn|Socolofsky & Spetter|pp=150\u2013151}}\n\n====Annexation of Hawaii====\nIn the last days of his administration, Harrison dealt with the issue of [[Hawaii]]an annexation. Following [[Overthrow of the Kingdom of Hawaii|a coup d'\u00e9tat]] against Queen [[Liliuokalani]], the new government of Hawaii led by [[Sanford B. Dole|Sanford Dole]] petitioned for annexation by the United States.{{sfn|Socolofsky & Spetter|pp=204\u2013205}} Harrison was interested in expanding American influence in Hawaii and in establishing a naval base at [[Pearl Harbor]] but had not previously expressed an opinion on annexing the islands.{{sfn|Calhoun|2005|pp=125\u2013126}} The United States [[Consul (representative)|consul]] in Hawaii, [[John L.

With just one month left before leaving office, the administration signed a treaty on February 14 and submitted it to the Senate the next day with Harrison's recommendation.{{sfn|Socolofsky & Spetter|pp=204\u2013205}} The Senate failed to act, and President Cleveland withdrew the treaty shortly after taking office.{{sfn|Calhoun|2005|p=132}}{{sfn|Moore|Hale|2006|p=147}}\n\n===Cabinet===\n[[File:BHarrison cabinet.jpg|thumb|Harrison's cabinet in 1889<br />Front row, left to right: '''Harrison''', [[William Windom]], [[John Wanamaker]], [[Redfield Proctor]], [[James G.

The first was [[David Josiah Brewer]], a judge on the [[United States Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit|Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit]]. Brewer, the nephew of Justice [[Stephen Johnson Field|Field]], had previously been considered for a cabinet position. Shortly after Brewer's nomination, Justice [[Stanley Matthews (lawyer)|Matthews]] died, creating another vacancy. Harrison had considered [[Henry Billings Brown]], a [[Michigan]] judge and [[admiralty law]] expert, for the first vacancy and now nominated him for the second. For the third vacancy, which arose in 1892, Harrison nominated [[George Shiras Jr.|George Shiras]]. Shiras's appointment was somewhat controversial because his age\u2014sixty\u2014was older than usual for a newly appointed Justice. Shiras also drew the opposition of Senator [[Matthew Quay]] of Pennsylvania because they were in different factions of the Pennsylvania Republican party, but his nomination was nonetheless approved. Finally, at the end of his term, Harrison nominated [[Howell Edmunds Jackson]] to replace Justice [[Lucius Quintus Cincinnatus Lamar (II)|Lamar]], who died in January 1893. Harrison knew the incoming Senate would be controlled by Democrats, so he selected Jackson, a respected Tennessee Democrat with whom he was friendly to ensure his nominee would not be rejected. Jackson's nomination was indeed successful, but he died after only two years on the Court.{{sfn|Socolofsky & Spetter|pp=188\u2013190}}\n\nIn addition to his Supreme Court appointments, Harrison appointed ten judges to the [[United States court of appeals|courts of appeals]], two judges to the [[United States circuit court|circuit courts]], and 26 judges to the [[United States district court|district courts]].\n\n===States admitted to the Union===\nSix new states were [[Admission to the Union|admitted to the Union]] while Harrison was in office:{{sfn|Socolofsky & Spetter|pp=44\u201345}}\n* [[North Dakota]]{{spaced ndash}}[[Enabling Act of 1889|November 2, 1889]]\n* [[South Dakota]]{{spaced ndash}}[[Enabling Act of 1889|November 2, 1889]]\n* [[Montana]]{{spaced ndash}}[[Enabling Act of 1889|November 8, 1889]]\n* [[Washington (state)|Washington]]{{spaced ndash}}[[Enabling Act of 1889|November 11, 1889]]\n* [[Idaho]]{{spaced ndash}}July 3, 1890\n* [[Wyoming]]{{spaced ndash}}July 10, 1890\nMore states were admitted during Harrison's presidency than any other.\n\n===Vacations and travel===\nHarrison attended a grand, three-day [[Legacy of George Washington#Centennial celebration|centennial celebration]] of George Washington's inauguration in [[New York City]] on April 30, 1889, and made the following remarks \"We have come into the serious but always inspiring presence of Washington.

The President typically made his best impression speaking before large audiences, as opposed to more intimate settings.{{sfn|Socolofsky & Spetter|p=157}} The most notable of his presidential trips, theretofore unequaled, was a five-week tour of the west in the spring of 1891, aboard a lavishly outfitted train.{{sfn|Socolofsky & Spetter|p=171}} Harrison enjoyed a number of short trips out of the capital\u2014usually for hunting\u2014to nearby Virginia or Maryland.{{sfn|Socolofsky & Spetter|p=166}}\n\nDuring the hot Washington summers, the Harrisons took refuge in [[Deer Park, Maryland]] and [[Cape May Point, New Jersey]]. In 1890, John Wanamaker joined with other Philadelphia devotees of the Harrisons and made a gift to them of a summer cottage at Cape May. Harrison, though appreciative, was uncomfortable with the appearance of impropriety; a month later, he paid Wanamaker $10,000 ({{Inflation|US|10000|1890|fmt=eq}}) as reimbursement to the donors. Nevertheless, Harrison's opponents made the gift the subject of national ridicule, and Mrs. Harrison and the president were vigorously criticized.{{sfn|Socolofsky & Spetter|p=168}}\n\n===Reelection campaign in 1892===\n{{main|1892 United States presidential election}}\n[[File:Eastman Johnson - Benjamin Harrison - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|upright=.6|Official [[White House]] portrait of Benjamin Harrison, painted by [[Eastman Johnson]]]]\nThe treasury surplus had evaporated and the nation's economic health was worsening \u2013 precursors to the eventual [[Panic of 1893]].{{sfn|Calhoun|2005|pp=107, 126\u2013127}} Congressional elections in 1890 had gone against the Republicans; and although Harrison had cooperated with Congressional Republicans on legislation, several party leaders withdrew their support for him because of his adamant refusal to give party members the nod in the course of his executive appointments. Specifically, Thomas C. Platt, Matthew S. Quay, Thomas B. Reed and James Clarkson quietly organized the Grievance Committee, the ambition of which was to initiate a dump-Harrison offensive. They solicited the support of Blaine, without effect however, and Harrison in reaction resolved to run for re-election \u2013 seemingly forced to choose one of two options \u2013 \"become a candidate or forever wear the name of a political coward\".{{sfn|Socolofsky & Spetter|p=81}}\n\nIt was clear that Harrison would not be re-nominated unanimously.{{sfn|Calhoun|2005|pp=134\u2013137}} Many of Harrison's detractors persisted in pushing for an incapacitated Blaine, though he announced that he was not a candidate in February 1892.{{sfn|Calhoun|2005|pp=134\u2013137}} Some party leaders still hoped to draft Blaine into running, and speculation increased when he resigned at the 11th hour as Secretary of State in June.{{sfn|Calhoun|2005|pp=138\u2013139}} At the [[1892 Republican National Convention|convention]] in [[Minneapolis]], Harrison prevailed on the first ballot, but encountered significant opposition.{{sfn|Calhoun|2005|pp=140\u2013141}}\n\nThe Democrats renominated former President Cleveland, making the 1892 election a rematch of the one four years earlier.

Harrison had been elected a companion of the [[Military Order of the Loyal Legion of the United States]] in 1882, and was elected as commander (president) of the Ohio Commandery on May 3, 1893. For a few months in 1894, Harrison lived in San Francisco, California, where he gave law lectures at [[Stanford University]].{{sfn|Calhoun|2005|p=158}} In 1896, some of Harrison's friends in the Republican party tried to convince him to seek the presidency again, but he declined.

Historians have often given Secretary of State Blaine credit for foreign-policy initiatives. However, Calhoun argues that Harrison was even more responsible for the success of trade negotiations, the buildup of the steel Navy, overseas expansion, and emphasis on the American role in dominating the hemisphere through the Monroe Doctrine. The major weakness which Calhoun sees was that the public and indeed the grassroots Republican Party was not fully prepared for this onslaught of major activity. The Democrats scored a sweeping landslide in 1890 by attacking the flagship legislation, especially the McKinley tariff, because it would raise the cost of living of the average American family. McKinley himself was defeated for reelection.<ref>Charles Calhoun, ''Benjamin Harrison'' (2005).</ref><ref>Charles Calhoun, \"Reimagining the \"Lost Men\" of the Gilded Age: Perspectives on the Late Nineteenth Century Presidents\". ''Journal of the Gilded Age and Progressive Era'' (2002) 1#3: 225\u2013257.</ref>\n\nAccording to historian R. Hal Williams, Harrison had a \"widespread reputation for personal and official integrity\". Closely scrutinized by Democrats, Harrison's reputation was largely intact when he left the White House. Having an advantage few 19th-century presidents had, Harrison's own party, the Republicans, controlled Congress, while his administration actively advanced a Republican program of a higher tariff, moderate control of corporations, protecting [[African American]] voting rights, a generous Civil War pension, and compromising over the controversial [[bimetallism|silver issue]]. Historians have not raised \"serious questions about Harrison's own integrity or the integrity of his administration\". {{sfn|Williams|p=191}}\n\nFollowing the [[Panic of 1893]], Harrison became more popular in retirement.{{sfn|Calhoun|2005|p=6}} His legacy among historians is scant, and \"general accounts of his period inaccurately treat Harrison as a cipher\".{{sfn|Socolofsky & Spetter|p=x}} More recently,\n<blockquote>historians have recognized the importance of the Harrison administration\u2014and Harrison himself\u2014in the new foreign policy of the late nineteenth century. The administration faced challenges throughout the hemisphere, in the Pacific, and in relations with the European powers, involvements that would be taken for granted in the twenty first century.{{sfn|Socolofsky & Spetter|p=x}}</blockquote>\n\nHarrison's presidency belongs properly to the 19th century, but he \"clearly pointed the way\" to the modern presidency that would emerge under [[William McKinley]].{{sfn|Calhoun|2005|p=166}} The bi-partisan [[Sherman Anti-Trust Act]] signed into law by Harrison remains in effect over 120 years later and was the most important legislation passed by the Fifty-first Congress. Harrison's support for [[African American]] voting rights and education would be the last significant attempts to protect [[Civil and political rights|civil rights]] until the 1930s.

Their father came from [[Tann, Hesse|Tann]] and studied singing, piano, organ and violin at the [[State University of Music and Performing Arts Stuttgart|Stuttgart Conservatory]], meeting there his future wife Ida Frick.

In the collection of the Klee Foundation, [[Bern, Switzerland]]]]\nIn his early years, following his parents' wishes, Klee focused on becoming a musician; but he decided on the [[visual arts]] during his teen years, partly out of rebellion and partly because modern music lacked meaning for him.

He excelled at drawing but seemed to lack any natural color sense.  He later recalled, \"During the third winter I even realized that I probably would never learn to paint.\"<ref name=\"Kagan, p. 22\"/> During these times of youthful adventure, Klee spent much time in pubs and had affairs with lower-class women and artists' models. He had an illegitimate son in 1900 who died several weeks after birth.<ref name=\"Partsch, p. 11\">Partsch, p. 11</ref>\n\nAfter receiving his Fine Arts degree, Klee traveled in Italy from October 1901 to May 1902<ref>Olga's Gallery [http://www.abcgallery.com/K/klee/kleebio.html Paul Klee]</ref> with friend [[Hermann Haller (sculptor)|Hermann Haller]]. They visited in Rome, Florence, Naples and the Amalfi Coast, studying the master painters of past centuries.<ref name=\"Partsch, p. 11\"/> He exclaimed, \"The [[Roman Forum|Forum]] and the [[Holy See|Vatican]] have spoken to me.

By 1905, he was developing some experimental techniques, including drawing with a needle on a blackened pane of glass, resulting in fifty-seven works including his ''Portrait of My Father'' (1906).<ref name=\"Partsch, p. 10\"/> In the years 1903\u201305 he also completed a cycle of eleven zinc-plate [[etching]]s called ''Inventions'', his first exhibited works, in which he illustrated several grotesque characters.<ref name=\"Partsch, p. 11\"/><ref>''[http://artinvestment.ru/en/news/exhibitions/20090418_paul_klee_inventions.html \u201cInvention\u201d Paul Klee at the Museum of Contemporary Art San Francisco]'' ARTinvestment.RU \u2013 18 April 2009</ref> He commented, \"though I'm fairly satisfied with my etchings I can't go on like this.

They lived in a suburb of Munich, and while she gave piano lessons and occasional performances, he kept house and tended to his art work. His attempt to be a magazine illustrator failed.<ref name=\"Partsch, p. 12\"/> Klee's art work progressed slowly for the next five years, partly from having to divide his time with domestic matters, and partly as he tried to find a new approach to his art.  In 1910, he had his first solo exhibition in Bern, which then travelled to three Swiss cities.\n\n=== Affiliation to the \"Blaue Reiter\", 1911 ===\nIn January 1911 [[Alfred Kubin]] met Klee in Munich and encouraged him to illustrate [[Voltaire]]'s ''[[Candide]]''. His resultant drawings were published later in a 1920 version of the book edited by Kurt Wolff. Around this time, Klee's graphic work increased. His early inclination towards the absurd and the sarcastic was well received by Kubin, who befriended Klee and became one of his first significant collectors.<ref name=\"Baumgartner207\">Beate Ofczarek, Stefan Frey: ''Chronologie einer Freundschaft''. Michael Baumgartner, Cathrin Klings\u00f6hr-Leroy, Katja Schneider, p. 207</ref> Klee met, through Kubin, the art critic Wilhelm Hausenstein in 1911.

On meeting Kandinsky, Klee recorded, \"I came to feel a deep trust in him.  He is somebody, and has an exceptionally beautiful and lucid mind.\"<ref>Jardi, p. 12</ref> Other members included Macke, [[Gabriele M\u00fcnter]] and [[Marianne von Werefkin]]. Klee became in a few months one of the most important and independent members of the ''Blaue Reiter'', but he was not yet fully integrated.<ref>G\u00f6ttler: ''Der Blaue Reiter'', p. 118</ref>\n\nThe release of the almanac was delayed for the benefit of an exhibition. The first ''Blaue Reiter'' exhibition took place from 18 December 1911 to 1 January 1912 in the Moderne Galerie Heinrich Thannhauser in Munich. Klee did not attend it, but in the second exhibition, which occurred from 12 February to 18 March 1912 in the [[Hans Goltz|Galerie Goltz]], 17 of his graphic works were shown. The name of this art exhibition was ''Schwarz-Wei\u00df'', as it only regarded graphic painting.<ref>Dietmar Elger, ''Expressionismus''. 1988, p. 141, {{ISBN|3-8228-0093-7}}</ref> Initially planned to be released in 1911, the release date of the ''Der Blau Reiter'' almanac by Kandinsky and Marc was delayed in May 1912, including the reproduced ink drawing ''Steinhauer'' by Klee. At the same time, Kandinsky published his art history writing ''\u00dcber das Geistige in der Kunst''.<ref>Catalogue raisonn\u00e9, volume 1, 1998, p. 512; Thomas Kain, Mona Meister, Franz-Joachim Verspohl; ''Paul Klee in Jena 1924.

His travels to Paris in 1912 also exposed him to the ferment of [[Cubism]] and the pioneering examples of \"pure painting\", an early term for [[abstract art]]. The use of bold color by [[Robert Delaunay]] and [[Maurice de Vlaminck]] also inspired him.<ref>Partsch, p. 18</ref> Rather than copy these artists, Klee began working out his own color experiments in pale watercolors and did some primitive landscapes, including ''In the Quarry'' (1913) and ''Houses near the Gravel Pit'' (1913), using blocks of color with limited overlap.<ref>Jardi, plate 7, 9</ref> Klee acknowledged that \"a long struggle lies in store for me in this field of color\" in order to reach his \"distant noble aim.\"  Soon, he discovered \"the style which connects drawing and the realm of color.\"<ref name=\"Kagan, p. 23\"/>\n\n===Trip to Tunis, 1914===\nKlee's artistic breakthrough came in 1914 when he briefly visited Tunisia with [[August Macke]] and [[Louis Moilliet]] and was impressed by the quality of the light there.  He wrote, \"Color has taken possession of me; no longer do I have to chase after it, I know that it has hold of me forever... Color and I are one. I am a painter.\"<ref name=\"Partsch, p. 20\">Partsch, p. 20</ref> With that realization, faithfulness to nature faded in importance. Instead, Klee began to delve into the \"cool romanticism of abstraction\".<ref name=\"Partsch, p. 20\"/> In gaining a second artistic vocabulary, Klee added color to his abilities in draftsmanship, and in many works combined them successfully, as he did in one series he called \"operatic paintings\".<ref>Partsch, pp. 24\u201325</ref><ref>Kagan, p. 33</ref> One of the most literal examples of this new synthesis is ''The Bavarian Don Giovanni'' (1919).<ref>Kagan, p. 35</ref>\n\nAfter returning home, Klee painted his first pure abstract, ''In the Style of Kairouan'' (1914), composed of colored rectangles and a few circles.<ref>Partsch, p. 27</ref> The colored rectangle became his basic building block, what some scholars associate with a musical note, which Klee combined with other colored blocks to create a color harmony analogous to a musical composition. His selection of a particular color palette emulates a musical key. Sometimes he uses complementary pairs of colors, and other times \"dissonant\" colors, again reflecting his connection with musicality.<ref>Kagan, pp. 27, 29.</ref>\n\n===Military career===\n[[File:Paul Klee, 1916.jpg|right|upright|thumb|Paul Klee as a soldier, 1916]]\nA few weeks later, [[World War I]] began. At first, Klee was somewhat detached from it, as he wrote ironically, \"I have long had this war in me. That is why, inwardly, it is none of my concern.\"<ref>Partsch, p. 31</ref> Klee was [[conscription|conscripted]] as a ''Landsturmsoldat'' (soldier of the reserve forces in [[Prussia]] or Imperial Germany) on 5 March 1916. The deaths of his friends [[August Macke]] and [[Franz Marc]] in battle began to affect him. Venting his distress, he created several pen and ink [[lithograph]]s on war themes including ''Death for the Idea'' (1915).<ref>Reproduced alongside Gerg Traki's poem in Zeit-Echo 1915.A reverse [[ekphrasis]].</ref> After finishing the military training course, which began on 11 March 1916, he was committed as a soldier behind the front. Klee moved on 20 August to the aircraft maintenance company{{Ref label|fn_2|b|b}} in [[Oberschleissheim]], executing skilled manual work, such as restoring aircraft [[camouflage]], and accompanying aircraft transports. On 17 January 1917, he was transferred to the Royal Bavarian flying school in [[Gersthofen]] (which 54 years later became the [[USASA Field Station Augsburg]]) to work as a clerk for the treasurer until the end of the war. This allowed him to stay in a small room outside of the barrack block and continue painting.<ref name=\"Baumgartner214f\">Beate Ofczarek, Stefan Frey: ''Chronologie einer Freundschaft'', pp.&nbsp;214&nbsp;et seqq</ref><ref>Partsch, p. 35</ref>\n\nHe continued to paint during the entire war and managed to exhibit in several shows. By 1917, Klee's work was selling well and art critics acclaimed him as the best of the new German artists.<ref>Partsch, p. 36</ref> His ''[[Ab ovo (painting)|Ab ovo]]'' (1917) is particularly noteworthy for its sophisticated technique. It employs watercolor on gauze and paper with a chalk ground, which produces a rich texture of triangular, circular, and crescent patterns.<ref name=\"Partsch, p. 20\"/> Demonstrating his range of exploration, mixing color and line, his ''Warning of the Ships'' (1918) is a colored drawing filled with symbolic images on a field of suppressed color.<ref>Partsch, p. 40</ref>\n\n== Mature career ==\n[[File:Paul Klee, 1922, Red Balloon, oil on chalk-primed gauze, mounted on board, 31.7 x 31.1 cm, Solomon R.

That same year, Klee had his first exhibits in Paris, and he became a hit with the French Surrealists.<ref>Jardi, pp. 18\u201319</ref> Klee visited Egypt in 1928, which impressed him less than Tunisia. In 1929, the first major [[monograph]] on Klee's work was published, written by Will Grohmann.<ref>Jardi, p. 20</ref>\n[[File:Nocturnal Festivity.JPG|thumb|''Nocturnal Festivity'', 1921, The Solomon R.

His ''[[Ad Parnassum (Klee)|Ad Parnassum]]'' (1932) is considered his masterpiece and the best example of his [[Pointillism|pointillist style]]; it is also one of his largest, most finely worked paintings.<ref>Partsch, p. 64</ref><ref>Kagan, p. 42</ref> He produced nearly 500 works in 1933 during his last year in Germany.<ref>Partsch, p. 74</ref> However, in 1933, Klee began experiencing the symptoms of what was diagnosed as [[scleroderma]] after his death. The progression of his fatal disease, which made swallowing very difficult, can be followed through the art he created in his last years. His output in 1936 was only 25 pictures. In the later 1930s, his health recovered somewhat and he was encouraged by a visit from Kandinsky and Picasso.<ref>Jardi, p. 25</ref> Klee's simpler and larger designs enabled him to keep up his output in his final years, and in 1939 he created over 1,200 works, a career high for one year.<ref>Partsch, p. 76</ref> He used heavier lines and mainly geometric forms with fewer but larger blocks of color. His varied color palettes, some with bright colors and others somber, perhaps reflected his alternating moods of optimism and pessimism.<ref>Partsch, pp. 77\u201380</ref> Back in Germany in 1937, seventeen of Klee's pictures were included in an exhibition of \"[[Degenerate art]]\" and 102 of his works in public collections were seized by the Nazis.<ref>Partsch, p. 94</ref>\n\n== Death ==\n[[File:Bern Schosshaldenfriedhof Grabstein Paul Klee DSC01491.JPG|left|thumb|Klee's grave in Schosshalden cemetery]]\nKlee suffered from a wasting disease, [[scleroderma]], toward the end of his life, enduring pain that seems to be reflected in his last works of art. One of his last paintings, ''[[Death and Fire]]'', features a skull in the center with the German word for death, \"Tod\", appearing in the face. He died in [[Muralto]], Locarno, Switzerland, on 29 June 1940 without having obtained Swiss citizenship, despite his birth in that country.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.swissinfo.ch/ger/ein-berner--aber-kein-schweizer-kuenstler/624962|title=Ein Berner, aber kein Schweizer K\u00fcnstler|last=swissinfo.ch|first=S.

In the collection of the [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]], New York]]\nKlee has been variously associated with [[Expressionism]], [[Cubism]], [[Futurism]], [[Surrealism]], and [[Abstract art|Abstraction]], but his pictures are difficult to classify. He generally worked in isolation from his peers, and interpreted new art trends in his own way. He was inventive in his methods and technique. Klee worked in many different media\u2014[[oil paint]], [[watercolor]], [[ink]], [[pastel]], [[etching]], and others. He often combined them into one work. He used canvas, burlap, muslin, linen, gauze, cardboard, metal foils, fabric, wallpaper, and newsprint.<ref>Kagan, p. 26</ref> Klee employed spray paint, knife application, stamping, glazing, and impasto, and [[mixed media]] such as oil with watercolor, watercolor with pen and India ink, and oil with tempera.<ref>Partsch, pp. 58\u201360</ref>\n\nHe was a natural draftsman, and through long experimentation developed a mastery of color and tonality. Many of his works combine these skills. He uses a great variety of color palettes from nearly [[Monochrome|monochromatic]] to highly [[polychrome|polychromatic]]. His works often have a fragile childlike quality to them and are usually on a small scale. He often used geometric forms and [[grid format]] compositions as well as letters and numbers, frequently combined with playful figures of animals and people. Some works were completely abstract. Many of his works and their titles reflect his dry humor and varying moods; some express political convictions. They frequently allude to poetry, music and dreams and sometimes include words or [[musical notation]]. The later works are distinguished by spidery [[Egyptian hieroglyphs|hieroglyph]]-like symbols. [[Rainer Maria Rilke]] wrote about Klee in 1921, \"Even if you hadn\u2019t told me he plays the violin, I would have guessed that on many occasions his drawings were transcriptions of music.\"<ref name=\"Jardi, p. 8\"/>\n\nPamela Kort observed: \"Klee's 1933 drawings present their beholder with an unparalleled opportunity to glimpse a central aspect of his [[aesthetics]] that has remained largely unappreciated: his lifelong concern with the possibilities of [[parody]] and [[wit]]. Herein lies their real significance, particularly for an audience unaware that Klee's art has [[political]] dimensions.\"<ref>[http://www.culturekiosque.com/art/exhibiti/paulklee.html Paul Klee 1933<!-- bot-generated title -->] at www.culturekiosque.com</ref>\n\nAmong the few plastic works are [[hand puppet]]s made between 1916 and 1925, for his son Felix.

''Jungfrau im Baum'' ties on the motive ''[[Le cattive madri]]'' (1894) by [[Giovanni Segantini]]. The picture was influenced by grotesque lyric poetries of [[Alfred Jarry]], [[Max Jacob]] and [[Christian Morgenstern]].<ref>Giedion-Welcker: ''Klee'', pp.&nbsp;23&nbsp;et seqq</ref> It features a cultural pessimism, which can be found at the turn of the 20th century in works by [[Symbolism (arts)|Symbolists]].

The aim was not to imitate nature, but to create compositions analogous to nature's formative principle, as in the works ''In den H\u00e4usern von Saint-Germain'' (In the Houses of Saint-Germain) and ''Stra\u00dfencaf\u00e9'' (Streetcaf\u00e9). Klee conveyed the scenery in a grid, so that it dissolves into colored harmony. He also created abstract works in that period such as ''Abstract'' and ''Farbige Kreise durch Farbb\u00e4nder verbunden'' (Colored Circles Tied Through Inked Ribbons).<ref>{{cite web|publisher=Meisterwerke der Kunst, Isis Verlag|url=http://www.drklaas.de/German/Kunst/klee/klee_info.html|title=Paul Klee|accessdate=25 September 2008|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090109074533/http://www.drklaas.de/German/Kunst/klee/klee_info.html|archivedate=9 January 2009}}</ref> He never abandoned the object; a permanent segregation never took place. It took over ten years that Klee worked on experiments and analysis of the color, resulting to an independent artificial work, whereby his design ideas were based on the colorful oriental world.\n<div align=\"center\"><gallery perrow=\"4\" widths=\"160\">\nFile:Fenster u.

It indicates the relations between color and the stimulus of Macke and Delaunay. Although elements of the garden are clearly visible, a further steering towards abstraction is noticeable. In his diary Klee wrote the following note at that time:\n\n<blockquote>In the large molding pit are lying ruins, on which one partially hangs. They provide the material for the abstraction. [\u2026] The terrible the world, the abstract the art, while a happy world produces secularistic art.<ref>G\u00f6ttler: ''Der Blaue Reiter''. pp. 118&nbsp;et seq</ref></blockquote>\nUnder the impression of his military service he created the painting ''Trauerblumen'' (Velvetbells) in 1917, which, with its graphical signs, vegetal and phantastic shapes, is a forerunner of his future works, harmonically combining graphic, color and object. For the first time birds appear in the pictures, such as in ''Blumenmythos'' (Flower Myth) from 1918, mirroring the flying and falling planes he saw in Gersthofen, and the photographed plane crashes.\n\nIn the 1918 watercolor painting ''Einst dem Grau der Nacht enttaucht'', a compositional implemented poem, possible written by Klee, he incorporated letters in small, in terms of color separated squares, cutting off the first verse from the second one with silver paper. At the top of the cardboard, which carries the picture, the verses are inscribed in manuscript form. Here, Klee did not lean on Delaunay's colors, but on Marc's, although the picture content of both painters does not correspond with each other. [[Herwarth Walden]], Klee's art dealer, saw in them a \"Wachabl\u00f6sung\" (changing of the guard) of his art.<ref>Partsch: ''Klee'', p.&nbsp;41</ref> Since 1919 he often used oil colors, with which he combined watercolors and colored pencil. The ''Villa R'' (Kunstmuseum Basel) from 1919 unites visible realities such as sun, moon, mountains, trees and architectures, as well as surreal pledges and sentiment readings.<ref>{{cite web|publisher=augen.de|url=http://www.drklaas.de/German/Kunst/klee/klee_info.html|title=Kunst \u00f6ffnet Augen|accessdate=26 October 2008|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090109074533/http://www.drklaas.de/German/Kunst/klee/klee_info.html|archivedate=9 January 2009}}</ref>\n\n=== Works in the Bauhaus period and in D\u00fcsseldorf ===\nHis works during this time include ''[[Camel (in rhythmic landscape with trees)]]'' as well as other paintings with abstract graphical elements such as ''betroffener Ort'' (Affected Place) (1922). From that period he created ''[[Twittering Machine|Die Zwitscher-Maschine]]'' (The Twittering Machine), which was later removed from the [[National Gallery (Berlin)|National Gallery]]. After being named defamatory in the Munich exhibition \"[[Entartete Kunst]]\", the painting was later bought by the Buchholz Gallery, New York, and then transferred in 1939 to the [[Museum of Modern Art]]. The \"twittering\" in the title refers to the open-beaked birds, while the \"machine\" is illustrated by the crank.<ref>[http://www.moma.org/collection/provenance/provenance_object.php?object_id=37347 ''The Twittering-Machine''], moma.org, retrieved on 10 January 2011.</ref> [[File:GUGG_In_Angel%27s_Care.jpg|thumb|''In Engelshut,'' 1931, watercolor and colored inks on paper, mounted on paper, [[Solomon R.

The picture can be interpreted as a critic by Klee, who shows through denaturation of the birds, that the world technization heist the creatures' self-determination.<ref>Siglind Bruhn: [https://books.google.com/books?id=E2CEqASxLSQC ''Das t\u00f6nende Museum''], Gorz Verlag 2004, pp.&nbsp;34&nbsp; et seq</ref>\n\nOther examples from that period are ''der Goldfisch'' (The Goldfish) from 1925, ''Katze und Vogel'' (Cat and Bird), from 1928, and ''Hauptweg und Nebenwege'' (Main Road and Byways) from 1929. Through variations of the canvas ground and his combined painting techniques Klee created new color effects and picture impressions.\n\nFrom 1916 to 1925, Klee created 50 hand puppets for his son Felix.

Among these figurations is \"In Engelshut\" (In the Angel's Care). Its overlaying technique evinces the polyphonic character of his drawing method between 1920 and 1932.<ref>Andrew Kagan, ''Paul Klee at the Guggenheim Museum,'' New York: Guggenheim Museum Library, 2003, 41.</ref>\n\nThe 1932 painting ''Ad Parnassum'' was also created in the D\u00fcsseldorf period. {{convert|100|\u00d7|126|cm|in|abbr=on}} This is one of his largest paintings, as he usually worked with small formats. In this mosaic-like work in the style of [[pointillism]] he combined different techniques and compositional principles. Influenced by his trip to Egypt from 1928 to 1929, Klee built a color field from individually stamped dots, surrounded by similarly stamped lines, which results in a pyramid. Above the roof of the \"[[Parnassus]]\" there is a sun. The title identifies the picture as the home of [[Apollo]] and the [[Muse]]s.<ref>Partsch: ''Klee'', p.&nbsp;67</ref> During his 1929 travels through Egypt, Klee developed a sense of connection to the land, described by art historian [[Olivier Berggruen]] as a mystical feeling: \"In the desert, the sun's intense rays seemed to envelop all living things, and at night, the movement of the stars felt even more palpable. In the architecture of the ancient funerary moments Klee discovered a sense of proportion and measure in which human beings appeared to establish a convincing relationship with the immensity of the landscape; furthermore, he was drawn to the esoteric numerology that governed the way in which these monuments had been built.\"<ref>Berggruen, \"Paul Klee \u2013 In Search of Natural Signs\" in ''The Writing of Art'' (London: Pushkin Press, 2011), 63.</ref> In 1933, his last year in Germany, he created a range of paintings and drawings; the catalogue raisonn\u00e9 comprised 482 works. The self-portrait in the same year\u2014with the programmatic title ''von der Liste gestrichen'' (removed from the list)\u2014provides information about his feeling after losing his professorship. The abstract portrait was painted in dark colors and shows closed eyes and compressed lips, while on the back of his head there is a large \"X\", symbolizing that his art was no longer valued in Germany.<ref>Partsch: ''Klee'', p.&nbsp;75</ref>\n<div align=\"center\"><gallery perrow=\"4\" widths=\"160\">\nFile:Red Green Architecture yellow violet gradation by Paul Klee.jpeg|''Red/Green Architecture (yellow/violet gradation)'', 1922, oil on canvas on cardboard mat, [[Yale University Art Gallery]], [[Yale University]], [[New Haven, Connecticut]]\nFile:Paul Klee, 1922, Senecio, oil on gauze, 40.3 \u00d7 37.4 cm, Kunstmuseum Basel.jpg|''[[Senecio (Klee)|Senecio]]'', 1922, oil on gauze, [[Kunstmuseum Basel]], Basel\nFile:GUGG Fright of a Girl.jpg| ''Fright of a Girl'', 1922, Watercolor, India ink and oil transfer drawing on paper, with India ink on paper mount, [[Solomon R.

After the onset of illness, there were about 25 works in the 1936 catalogue, but his productivity increased in 1937 to 264 pictures, 1938 to 489, and 1939\u2014his most productive year\u2014to 1254. They dealt with [[Ambivalence|ambivalent]] themes, expressing his personal fate, the political situation and his wit. Examples are the watercolor painting ''Musiker'' (musician), a stick-man face with partially serious, partially smiling mouth; and the ''Revolution des Viadukts'' (Revolution of the Viadukt), an [[Anti-fascism|anti-fascist]] art. In ''Viadukt'' (1937) the bridge arches split from the bank as they refuse to be linked to a chain and are therefore rioting.<ref>Partsch: ''Klee'', p.&nbsp;92</ref>\nSince 1938, Klee worked more intensively with hieroglyphic-like elements. The painting ''[[Insula dulcamara]]'' from the same year, which is one of his largest ({{convert|88|\u00d7|176|cm|in|abbr=on}}), shows a white face in the middle of the elements, symbolizing death with its black-circled eye sockets. Bitterness and sorrow are not rare in much of his works during this time.\n<div align=\"center\"><gallery perrow=\"4\">\nFile:Paul Klee Zeichen in Gelb 1937.jpg|''Zeichen in Gelb'', 1937, pastel on cotton on colored paste on jute on stretcher frame, Fondation Beyeler, Riehen near Basel\nFile:Paul Klee Nach der \u00dcberschwemmung.jpg|''Nach der \u00dcberschwemmung'', 1936, wallpaper glue and watercolors on Ingres paper on cardboard\nFile:Paul Klee, Revolution des Viadukts, 1937.jpg|''Revolution des Viadukts'', 1937, oil on oil grounding on cotton on stretcher frame, [[Kunsthalle Hamburg|Hamburger Kunsthalle]]\nFile:Paul Klee Die Vase.jpg|''Die Vase'', 1938, oil on jute, Fondation Beyeler, Riehen near Basel\nFile:Heroic Roses.JPG|''Heroische Rosen'' (Heroic Roses), 1938, oil on canvas, [[Kunstsammlung Nordrhein-Westfalen]], D\u00fcsseldorf\nFile:Paul Klee, Insula dulcamara.jpg|''[[Insula dulcamara]]'', 1938, oil color and colored paste on newsprint on jute on stretcher frame, [[Zentrum Paul Klee]], Bern\nFile:Paul Klee, Ohne Titel (Der Todesengel).jpg|''Ohne Titel (Letztes Stillleben)'', 1940, oil on canvas on stretcher frame, Zentrum Paul Klee, Bern\nFile:Death and Fire.JPG|''[[Death and Fire|Tod und Feuer]]'' (Death and Fire), 1940, oil on distemper on jute, Zentrum Paul Klee, Bern\n</gallery></div>\nKlee created in 1940 a picture which strongly differs from the previous works, leaving it unsigned on the scaffold. The comparatively realistic [[still life]], ''Ohne Titel'', later named as ''Der Todesengel'' (Angel of Death), depicts flowers, a green pot, sculpture and an angel. The moon on black ground is separated from these groups.

In a minimum of one line he can reveal his wisdom.

[\u2026] For Klee, the German classic painter of the Cubism, the world music became his companion, possibly even a part of his art; the composition, written in notes, seems to be not dissimilar.\"<ref>Giedion-Welcker: ''Klee'', p.&nbsp;162</ref>\n\nWhen Klee visited the Paris surrealism exhibition in 1925, [[Max Ernst]] was impressed by his work. His partially morbid motifs appealed to the surrealists. [[Andr\u00e9 Breton]] helped to develop the surrealism and renamed Klee's 1912 painting ''Zimmerperspektive mit Einwohnern'' (Room Perspective with People) to ''chambre spirit'' in a catalogue. Critic [[Ren\u00e9 Crevel]] called the artist a \"dreamer\" who \"releases a swarm of small lyrical louses from mysterious abysses.\" Paul Klee's confidante [[Will Grohmann]] argued in the ''Cahiers d'art'' that he \"stands definitely well solid on his feet. He is by no means a dreamer; he is a modern person, who teaches as a professor at the Bauhaus.\" Whereupon Breton, as [[Joan Mir\u00f3]] remembers, was critical of Klee: \"Masson and I have both discovered Paul Klee. [[Paul \u00c9luard]] and Crevel are also interested in Klee, and they have even visited him. But Breton despises him.\"<ref>{{cite news|author=Catrin Lorch|newspaper=Frankfurter Allgemeine|date=4 January 2007|url=http://g26.ch/memo/paul_klee_01.html|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110714133553/http://g26.ch/memo/paul_klee_01.html|archivedate=14 July 2011|title=Klees feine kleine Klumpgeister|language=German|accessdate=2 October 2008}}</ref>\n\nThe art of mentally ill people inspired Klee as well as Kandinsky and Max Ernst, after [[Hans Prinzhorn]]s book ''Bildnerei der Geisteskranken'' (Artistry of the Mentally Ill) was published in 1922. In 1937, some papers from Prinzhorn's anthology were presented at the National Socialist [[propaganda]] exhibition \"[[Entartete Kunst]]\" in Munich, with the purpose of defaming the works of [[Ernst Ludwig Kirchner|Kirchner]], Klee, [[Emil Nolde|Nolde]] and other artists by likening them to the works of the insane.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.jena.de/sixcms/detail.php?id=79234&_nav_id1=58181&_nav_id2=58182&_lang=de|title=Sammlung Prinzhorn der Psychiatrischen Universit\u00e4tsklinik Heidelberg|publisher=St\u00e4dtische Museen Jena|language=German|accessdate=2 January 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131101223320/http://www.jena.de/sixcms/detail.php?id=79234&_nav_id1=58181&_nav_id2=58182&_lang=de|archive-date=1 November 2013|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\nIn 1949 [[Marcel Duchamp]] commented on Paul Klee: \"The first reaction in front of a Klee painting is the very pleasant discovery, what everyone of us could or could have done, to try drawing like in our childhood. Most of his compositions show at the first glance a plain, naive expression, found in children's drawings. [\u2026] At a second analyse one can discover a technique, which takes as a basis a large maturity in thinking. A deep understanding of dealing with watercolors to paint a personal method in oil, structured in decorative shapes, let Klee stand out in the contemporary art and make him incomparable. On the other side, his experiment was adopted in the last 30 years by many other artists as a basis for newer creations in the most different areas in painting. His extreme productivity never shows evidence of repetition, as is usually the case. He had so much to say, that a Klee never became another Klee.\"<ref name=\"Herbert376\">Robert L.

In his \"Theses on the Philosophy of History\" Benjamin suggests that the angel depicted in the painting might be seen as representing the angel of history.\n\nAnother aspect of his legacy, and one demonstrating his multi-faceted presence in the modern artistic imagination, is his appeal for those interested in the history of the algorithm as exemplified by ''Homage to Paul Klee'' by computer art pioneer Frieder Nake.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.mdpi.com/2076-0752/8/2/69|author=Smith, Glenn|date=31 May 2019|title=An Interview with Frieder Nake|publisher=Arts|accessdate=2 June 2019}}</ref>\n\n=== Musical interpretations ===\n[[File:Paul Klee Zentrum.jpg|thumb|[[Zentrum Paul Klee]] in Bern, Switzerland, designed by [[Renzo Piano]]]]\nUnlike his taste for adventurous modern experiment in painting, Klee, though musically talented, was attracted to older traditions of music; he neither appreciated composers of the late 19th century, such as [[Richard Wagner|Wagner]], [[Anton Bruckner|Bruckner]] and [[Gustav Mahler|Mahler]], nor contemporary music. [[Johann Sebastian Bach|Bach]] and [[Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart|Mozart]] were for him the greatest composers; he most enjoyed playing the works by the latter.<ref name=\"Baumgartner208\">Beate Ofczarek, Stefan Frey: ''Chronologie einer Freundschaft''.

His highly individual style was influenced by movements in art that included [[Expressionism]], [[Cubism]], and [[Surrealism]]. Klee was a natural draftsman who experimented with and eventually deeply explored [[color theory]], writing about it extensively; his lectures ''Writings on Form and Design Theory'' (''Schriften zur Form und Gestaltungslehre''), published in English as the ''[[Paul Klee Notebooks]]'', are held to be as important for modern art as [[Leonardo da Vinci]]'s ''[[A Treatise on Painting]]'' for the [[Renaissance]].<ref>Disegno e progettazione By Marcello Petrignani p. 17</ref><ref>[[Guilo Carlo Argan]] \"Preface\", Paul Klee, The Thinking Eye, (ed.

His sister Mathilde (died 6 December 1953) was born on 28 January 1876 in [[Walzenhausen]]. Their father came from [[Tann, Hesse|Tann]] and studied singing, piano, organ and violin at the [[State University of Music and Performing Arts Stuttgart|Stuttgart Conservatory]], meeting there his future wife Ida Frick. Hans Wilhelm Klee was active as a music teacher at the Bern State Seminary in [[Hofwil]] near Bern until 1931.

In the collection of the Klee Foundation, [[Bern, Switzerland]]]]\nIn his early years, following his parents' wishes, Klee focused on becoming a musician; but he decided on the [[visual arts]] during his teen years, partly out of rebellion and partly because modern music lacked meaning for him. He stated, \"I didn't find the idea of going in for music creatively particularly attractive in view of the decline in the history of musical achievement.\"<ref name=\"Partsch, p. 9\">Partsch, p. 9</ref> As a musician, he played and felt emotionally bound to traditional works of the [[Classical period (music)|eighteenth]] and [[Romantic music|nineteenth]] century, but as an artist he craved the freedom to explore radical ideas and styles.<ref name=\"Partsch, p. 9\"/> At sixteen, Klee's landscape drawings already show considerable skill.<ref name=\"Kagan, p. 54\">Kagan p. 54</ref>\n\nAround 1897, Klee started his diary, which he kept until 1918, and which has provided scholars with valuable insight into his life and thinking.<ref>Partsch, p. 7</ref> During his school years, he avidly drew in his school books, in particular drawing [[caricatures]], and already demonstrating skill with line and volume.<ref name=\"Partsch, p. 10\">Partsch, p. 10</ref> He barely passed his final exams at the \"Gymnasium\" of Bern, where he qualified in the [[Humanities]]. With his characteristic dry wit, he wrote, \"After all, it\u2019s rather difficult to achieve the ''exact'' minimum, and it involves risks.\"<ref name=\"Kagan, p. 22\">Kagan, p. 22</ref> On his own time, in addition to his deep interests in music and art, Klee was a great reader of literature, and later a writer on [[art theory]] and [[aesthetics]].<ref name=\"Jardi, p. 8\">Jardi, p. 8</ref>\n\nWith his parents' reluctant permission, in 1898 Klee began studying art at the [[Academy of Fine Arts, Munich|Academy of Fine Arts]] in [[Munich]] with [[Heinrich Knirr]] and [[Franz von Stuck]].  He excelled at drawing but seemed to lack any natural color sense.  He later recalled, \"During the third winter I even realized that I probably would never learn to paint.\"<ref name=\"Kagan, p. 22\"/> During these times of youthful adventure, Klee spent much time in pubs and had affairs with lower class women and artists' models. He had an illegitimate son in 1900 who died several weeks after birth.<ref name=\"Partsch, p. 11\">Partsch, p. 11</ref>\n\nAfter receiving his Fine Arts degree, Klee traveled in Italy from October 1901 to May 1902<ref>Olga's Gallery [http://www.abcgallery.com/K/klee/kleebio.html Paul Klee]</ref> with friend [[Hermann Haller (sculptor)|Hermann Haller]]. They visited in Rome, Florence, Naples and the Amalfi Coast, studying the master painters of past centuries.<ref name=\"Partsch, p. 11\"/> He exclaimed, \"The [[Roman Forum|Forum]] and the [[Holy See|Vatican]] have spoken to me.  [[Humanism]] wants to suffocate me.\"<ref>Jardi, p. 9</ref> He responded to the colors of Italy, but sadly noted, \"that a long struggle lies in store for me in this field of color.\"<ref name=\"Kagan, p. 23\">Kagan, p. 23</ref> For Klee, color represented the optimism and nobility in art, and a hope for relief from the pessimistic nature he expressed in his black-and-white grotesques and satires.<ref name=\"Kagan, p. 23\"/> Returning to Bern, he lived with his parents for several years, and took occasional art classes. By 1905, he was developing some experimental techniques, including drawing with a needle on a blackened pane of glass, resulting in fifty-seven works including his ''Portrait of My Father'' (1906).<ref name=\"Partsch, p. 10\"/> In the years 1903\u201305 he also completed a cycle of eleven zinc-plate [[etching]]s called ''Inventions'', his first exhibited works, in which he illustrated several grotesque characters.<ref name=\"Partsch, p. 11\"/><ref>''[http://artinvestment.ru/en/news/exhibitions/20090418_paul_klee_inventions.html \u201cInvention\u201d Paul Klee at the Museum of Contemporary Art San Francisco]'' ARTinvestment.RU \u2013 18 April 2009</ref> He commented, \"though I'm fairly satisfied with my etchings I can't go on like this.

They lived in a suburb of Munich, and while she gave piano lessons and occasional performances, he kept house and tended to his art work. His attempt to be a magazine illustrator failed.<ref name=\"Partsch, p. 12\"/> Klee's art work progressed slowly for the next five years, partly from having to divide his time with domestic matters, and partly as he tried to find a new approach to his art.  In 1910, he had his first solo exhibition in Bern, which then travelled to three Swiss cities.\n\n=== Affiliation to the \"Blaue Reiter\", 1911 ===\nIn January 1911 [[Alfred Kubin]] met Klee in Munich and encouraged him to illustrate [[Voltaire]]'s ''[[Candide]]''. His resultant drawings were published later in a 1920 version of the book edited by Kurt Wolff. Around this time, Klee's graphic work increased. His early inclination towards the absurd and the sarcastic was well received by Kubin, who befriended Klee and became one of his first significant collectors.<ref name=\"Baumgartner207\">Beate Ofczarek, Stefan Frey: ''Chronologie einer Freundschaft''. Michael Baumgartner, Cathrin Klings\u00f6hr-Leroy, Katja Schneider, p. 207</ref> Klee met, through Kubin, the art critic Wilhelm Hausenstein in 1911. Klee was a foundation member and manager of the Munich artists' union ''Sema'' that summer.<ref name=\"Verspohl90\">Thomas Kain, Mona Meister, Franz-Joachim Verspohl, Jena 1999, p. 90</ref> In autumn he made an acquaintance with [[August Macke]] and [[Wassily Kandinsky]], and in winter he joined the editorial team of the almanac ''[[Der Blaue Reiter]]'', founded by [[Franz Marc]] and Kandinsky. On meeting Kandinsky, Klee recorded, \"I came to feel a deep trust in him.  He is somebody, and has an exceptionally beautiful and lucid mind.\"<ref>Jardi, p. 12</ref> Other members included Macke, [[Gabriele M\u00fcnter]] and [[Marianne von Werefkin]]. Klee became in a few months one of the most important and independent members of the ''Blaue Reiter'', but he was not yet fully integrated.<ref>G\u00f6ttler: ''Der Blaue Reiter'', p. 118</ref>\n\nThe release of the almanac was delayed for the benefit of an exhibition. The first ''Blaue Reiter'' exhibition took place from 18 December 1911 to 1 January 1912 in the Moderne Galerie Heinrich Thannhauser in Munich. Klee did not attend it, but in the second exhibition, which occurred from 12 February to 18 March 1912 in the [[Hans Goltz|Galerie Goltz]], 17 of his graphic works were shown. The name of this art exhibition was ''Schwarz-Wei\u00df'', as it only regarded graphic painting.<ref>Dietmar Elger, ''Expressionismus''. 1988, p. 141, {{ISBN|3-8228-0093-7}}</ref> Initially planned to be released in 1911, the release date of the ''Der Blau Reiter'' almanac by Kandinsky and Marc was delayed in May 1912, including the reproduced ink drawing ''Steinhauer'' by Klee. At the same time, Kandinsky published his art history writing ''\u00dcber das Geistige in der Kunst''.<ref>Catalogue raisonn\u00e9, volume 1, 1998, p. 512; Thomas Kain, Mona Meister, Franz-Joachim Verspohl; ''Paul Klee in Jena 1924.

His travels to Paris in 1912 also exposed him to the ferment of [[Cubism]] and the pioneering examples of \"pure painting\", an early term for [[abstract art]]. The use of bold color by [[Robert Delaunay]] and [[Maurice de Vlaminck]] also inspired him.<ref>Partsch, p. 18</ref> Rather than copy these artists, Klee began working out his own color experiments in pale watercolors and did some primitive landscapes, including ''In the Quarry'' (1913) and ''Houses near the Gravel Pit'' (1913), using blocks of color with limited overlap.<ref>Jardi, plate 7, 9</ref> Klee acknowledged that \"a long struggle lies in store for me in this field of color\" in order to reach his \"distant noble aim.\"  Soon, he discovered \"the style which connects drawing and the realm of color.\"<ref name=\"Kagan, p. 23\"/>\n\n===Trip to Tunis, 1914===\nKlee's artistic breakthrough came in 1914 when he briefly visited Tunisia with [[August Macke]] and [[Louis Moilliet]] and was impressed by the quality of the light there.  He wrote, \"Color has taken possession of me; no longer do I have to chase after it, I know that it has hold of me forever... Color and I are one. I am a painter.\"<ref name=\"Partsch, p. 20\">Partsch, p. 20</ref> With that realization, faithfulness to nature faded in importance. Instead, Klee began to delve into the \"cool romanticism of abstraction\".<ref name=\"Partsch, p. 20\"/> In gaining a second artistic vocabulary, Klee added color to his abilities in draftsmanship, and in many works combined them successfully, as he did in one series he called \"operatic paintings\".<ref>Partsch, pp. 24\u201325</ref><ref>Kagan, p. 33</ref> One of the most literal examples of this new synthesis is ''The Bavarian Don Giovanni'' (1919).<ref>Kagan, p. 35</ref>\n\nAfter returning home, Klee painted his first pure abstract, ''In the Style of Kairouan'' (1914), composed of colored rectangles and a few circles.<ref>Partsch, p. 27</ref> The colored rectangle became his basic building block, what some scholars associate with a musical note, which Klee combined with other colored blocks to create a color harmony analogous to a musical composition. His selection of a particular color palette emulates a musical key. Sometimes he uses complementary pairs of colors, and other times \"dissonant\" colors, again reflecting his connection with musicality.<ref>Kagan, pp. 27, 29.</ref>\n\n===Military career===\n[[File:Paul Klee, 1916.jpg|right|upright|thumb|Paul Klee as a soldier, 1916]]\nA few weeks later, [[World War I]] began. At first, Klee was somewhat detached from it, as he wrote ironically, \"I have long had this war in me. That is why, inwardly, it is none of my concern.\"<ref>Partsch, p. 31</ref> Klee was [[conscription|conscripted]] as a ''Landsturmsoldat'' (soldier of the reserve forces in [[Prussia]] or Imperial Germany) on 5 March 1916. The deaths of his friends [[August Macke]] and [[Franz Marc]] in battle began to affect him. Venting his distress, he created several pen and ink [[lithograph]]s on war themes including ''Death for the Idea'' (1915).<ref>Reproduced alongside Gerg Traki's poem in Zeit-Echo 1915.A reverse [[ekphrasis]].</ref> After finishing the military training course, which began on 11 March 1916, he was committed as a soldier behind the front. Klee moved on 20 August to the aircraft maintenance company{{Ref label|fn_2|b|b}} in [[Oberschleissheim]], executing skilled manual work, such as restoring aircraft [[camouflage]], and accompanying aircraft transports. On 17 January 1917, he was transferred to the Royal Bavarian flying school in [[Gersthofen]] (which 54 years later became the [[USASA Field Station Augsburg]]) to work as a clerk for the treasurer until the end of the war. This allowed him to stay in a small room outside of the barrack block and continue painting.<ref name=\"Baumgartner214f\">Beate Ofczarek, Stefan Frey: ''Chronologie einer Freundschaft'', pp.&nbsp;214&nbsp;et seqq</ref><ref>Partsch, p. 35</ref>\n\nHe continued to paint during the entire war and managed to exhibit in several shows. By 1917, Klee's work was selling well and art critics acclaimed him as the best of the new German artists.<ref>Partsch, p. 36</ref> His ''[[Ab ovo (painting)|Ab ovo]]'' (1917) is particularly noteworthy for its sophisticated technique. It employs watercolor on gauze and paper with a chalk ground, which produces a rich texture of triangular, circular, and crescent patterns.<ref name=\"Partsch, p. 20\"/> Demonstrating his range of exploration, mixing color and line, his ''Warning of the Ships'' (1918) is a colored drawing filled with symbolic images on a field of suppressed color.<ref>Partsch, p. 40</ref>\n\n== Mature career ==\n[[File:Paul Klee, 1922, Red Balloon, oil on chalk-primed gauze, mounted on board, 31.7 x 31.1 cm, Solomon R.

The progression of his fatal disease, which made swallowing very difficult, can be followed through the art he created in his last years. His output in 1936 was only 25 pictures. In the later 1930s, his health recovered somewhat and he was encouraged by a visit from Kandinsky and Picasso.<ref>Jardi, p. 25</ref> Klee's simpler and larger designs enabled him to keep up his output in his final years, and in 1939 he created over 1,200 works, a career high for one year.<ref>Partsch, p. 76</ref> He used heavier lines and mainly geometric forms with fewer but larger blocks of color.

In the collection of the [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]], New York]]\nKlee has been variously associated with [[Expressionism]], [[Cubism]], [[Futurism]], [[Surrealism]], and [[Abstract art|Abstraction]], but his pictures are difficult to classify. He generally worked in isolation from his peers, and interpreted new art trends in his own way. He was inventive in his methods and technique. Klee worked in many different media\u2014[[oil paint]], [[watercolor]], [[ink]], [[pastel]], [[etching]], and others. He often combined them into one work. He used canvas, burlap, muslin, linen, gauze, cardboard, metal foils, fabric, wallpaper, and newsprint.<ref>Kagan, p. 26</ref> Klee employed spray paint, knife application, stamping, glazing, and impasto, and [[mixed media]] such as oil with watercolor, watercolor with pen and India ink, and oil with tempera.<ref>Partsch, pp. 58\u201360</ref>\n\nHe was a natural draftsman, and through long experimentation developed a mastery of color and tonality. Many of his works combine these skills. He uses a great variety of color palettes from nearly [[Monochrome|monochromatic]] to highly [[polychrome|polychromatic]]. His works often have a fragile childlike quality to them and are usually on a small scale. He often used geometric forms and [[grid format]] compositions as well as letters and numbers, frequently combined with playful figures of animals and people. Some works were completely abstract. Many of his works and their titles reflect his dry humor and varying moods; some express political convictions. They frequently allude to poetry, music and dreams and sometimes include words or [[musical notation]]. The later works are distinguished by spidery [[Egyptian hieroglyphs|hieroglyph]]-like symbols. [[Rainer Maria Rilke]] wrote about Klee in 1921, \"Even if you hadn\u2019t told me he plays the violin, I would have guessed that on many occasions his drawings were transcriptions of music.\"<ref name=\"Jardi, p. 8\"/>\n\nPamela Kort observed: \"Klee's 1933 drawings present their beholder with an unparalleled opportunity to glimpse a central aspect of his [[aesthetics]] that has remained largely unappreciated: his lifelong concern with the possibilities of [[parody]] and [[wit]]. Herein lies their real significance, particularly for an audience unaware that Klee's art has [[political]] dimensions.\"<ref>[http://www.culturekiosque.com/art/exhibiti/paulklee.html Paul Klee 1933<!-- bot-generated title -->] at www.culturekiosque.com</ref>\n\nAmong the few plastic works are [[hand puppet]]s made between 1916 and 1925, for his son Felix.

''Jungfrau im Baum'' ties on the motive ''[[Le cattive madri]]'' (1894) by [[Giovanni Segantini]].

The aim was not to imitate nature, but to create compositions analogous to nature's formative principle, as in the works ''In den H\u00e4usern von Saint-Germain'' (In the Houses of Saint-Germain) and ''Stra\u00dfencaf\u00e9'' (Streetcaf\u00e9). Klee conveyed the scenery in a grid, so that it dissolves into colored harmony. He also created abstract works in that period such as ''Abstract'' and ''Farbige Kreise durch Farbb\u00e4nder verbunden'' (Colored Circles Tied Through Inked Ribbons).<ref>{{cite web|publisher=Meisterwerke der Kunst, Isis Verlag|url=http://www.drklaas.de/German/Kunst/klee/klee_info.html|title=Paul Klee|accessdate=25 September 2008|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090109074533/http://www.drklaas.de/German/Kunst/klee/klee_info.html|archivedate=9 January 2009}}</ref> He never abandoned the object; a permanent segregation never took place. It took over ten years that Klee worked on experiments and analysis of the color, resulting to an independent artificial work, whereby his design ideas were based on the colorful oriental world.\n<div align=\"center\"><gallery perrow=\"4\" widths=\"160\">\nFile:Fenster u.

It indicates the relations between color and the stimulus of Macke and Delaunay. Although elements of the garden are clearly visible, a further steering towards abstraction is noticeable. In his diary Klee wrote the following note at that time:\n\n<blockquote>In the large molding pit are lying ruins, on which one partially hangs. They provide the material for the abstraction. [\u2026] The terrible the world, the abstract the art, while a happy world produces secularistic art.<ref>G\u00f6ttler: ''Der Blaue Reiter''. pp. 118&nbsp;et seq</ref></blockquote>\nUnder the impression of his military service he created the painting ''Trauerblumen'' (Velvetbells) in 1917, which, with its graphical signs, vegetal and phantastic shapes, is a forerunner of his future works, harmonically combining graphic, color and object. For the first time birds appear in the pictures, such as in ''Blumenmythos'' (Flower Myth) from 1918, mirroring the flying and falling planes he saw in Gersthofen, and the photographed plane crashes.\n\nIn the 1918 watercolor painting ''Einst dem Grau der Nacht enttaucht'', a compositional implemented poem, possible written by Klee, he incorporated letters in small, in terms of color separated squares, cutting off the first verse from the second one with silver paper. At the top of the cardboard, which carries the picture, the verses are inscribed in manuscript form. Here, Klee did not lean on Delaunay's colors, but on Marc's, although the picture content of both painters does not correspond with each other. [[Herwarth Walden]], Klee's art dealer, saw in them a \"Wachabl\u00f6sung\" (changing of the guard) of his art.<ref>Partsch: ''Klee'', p.&nbsp;41</ref> Since 1919 he often used oil colors, with which he combined watercolors and colored pencil. The ''Villa R'' (Kunstmuseum Basel) from 1919 unites visible realities such as sun, moon, mountains, trees and architectures, as well as surreal pledges and sentiment readings.<ref>{{cite web|publisher=augen.de|url=http://www.drklaas.de/German/Kunst/klee/klee_info.html|title=Kunst \u00f6ffnet Augen|accessdate=26 October 2008|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090109074533/http://www.drklaas.de/German/Kunst/klee/klee_info.html|archivedate=9 January 2009}}</ref>\n\n=== Works in the Bauhaus period and in D\u00fcsseldorf ===\nHis works during this time include ''[[Camel (in rhythmic landscape with trees)]]'' as well as other paintings with abstract graphical elements such as ''betroffener Ort'' (Affected Place) (1922). From that period he created ''[[Twittering Machine|Die Zwitscher-Maschine]]'' (The Twittering Machine), which was later removed from the [[National Gallery (Berlin)|National Gallery]]. After being named defamatory in the Munich exhibition \"[[Entartete Kunst]]\", the painting was later bought by the Buchholz Gallery, New York, and then transferred in 1939 to the [[Museum of Modern Art]]. The \"twittering\" in the title refers to the open-beaked birds, while the \"machine\" is illustrated by the crank.<ref>[http://www.moma.org/collection/provenance/provenance_object.php?object_id=37347 ''The Twittering-Machine''], moma.org, retrieved on 10 January 2011.</ref> [[File:GUGG_In_Angel%27s_Care.jpg|thumb|''In Engelshut,'' 1931, watercolor and colored inks on paper, mounted on paper, [[Solomon R.

The picture can be interpreted as a critic by Klee, who shows through denaturation of the birds, that the world technization heist the creatures' self-determination.<ref>Siglind Bruhn: [https://books.google.com/books?id=E2CEqASxLSQC ''Das t\u00f6nende Museum''], Gorz Verlag 2004, pp.&nbsp;34&nbsp; et seq</ref>\n\nOther examples from that period are ''der Goldfisch'' (The Goldfish) from 1925, ''Katze und Vogel'' (Cat and Bird), from 1928, and ''Hauptweg und Nebenwege'' (Main Road and Byways) from 1929. Through variations of the canvas ground and his combined painting techniques Klee created new color effects and picture impressions.\n\nFrom 1916 to 1925, Klee created 50 hand puppets for his son Felix.

In this mosaic-like work in the style of [[pointillism]] he combined different techniques and compositional principles. Influenced by his trip to Egypt from 1928 to 1929, Klee built a color field from individually stamped dots, surrounded by similarly stamped lines, which results in a pyramid. Above the roof of the \"[[Parnassus]]\" there is a sun. The title identifies the picture as the home of [[Apollo]] and the [[Muse]]s.<ref>Partsch: ''Klee'', p.&nbsp;67</ref> During his 1929 travels through Egypt, Klee developed a sense of connection to the land, described by art historian [[Olivier Berggruen]] as a mystical feeling: \"In the desert, the sun's intense rays seemed to envelop all living things, and at night, the movement of the stars felt even more palpable. In the architecture of the ancient funerary moments Klee discovered a sense of proportion and measure in which human beings appeared to establish a convincing relationship with the immensity of the landscape; furthermore, he was drawn to the esoteric numerology that governed the way in which these monuments had been built.\"<ref>Berggruen, \"Paul Klee \u2013 In Search of Natural Signs\" in ''The Writing of Art'' (London: Pushkin Press, 2011), 63.</ref> In 1933, his last year in Germany, he created a range of paintings and drawings; the catalogue raisonn\u00e9 comprised 482 works. The self-portrait in the same year\u2014with the programmatic title ''von der Liste gestrichen'' (removed from the list)\u2014provides information about his feeling after losing his professorship.

They dealt with [[Ambivalence|ambivalent]] themes, expressing his personal fate, the political situation and his wit. Examples are the watercolor painting ''Musiker'' (musician), a stick-man face with partially serious, partially smiling mouth; and the ''Revolution des Viadukts'' (Revolution of the Viadukt), an [[Anti-fascism|anti-fascist]] art. In ''Viadukt'' (1937) the bridge arches split from the bank as they refuse to be linked to a chain and are therefore rioting.<ref>Partsch: ''Klee'', p.&nbsp;92</ref>\nSince 1938, Klee worked more intensively with hieroglyphic-like elements. The painting ''[[Insula dulcamara]]'' from the same year, which is one of his largest ({{convert|88|\u00d7|176|cm|in|abbr=on}}), shows a white face in the middle of the elements, symbolizing death with its black-circled eye sockets.

Critic [[Ren\u00e9 Crevel]] called the artist a \"dreamer\" who \"releases a swarm of small lyrical louses from mysterious abysses.\" Paul Klee's confidante [[Will Grohmann]] argued in the ''Cahiers d'art'' that he \"stands definitely well solid on his feet. He is by no means a dreamer; he is a modern person, who teaches as a professor at the Bauhaus.\" Whereupon Breton, as [[Joan Mir\u00f3]] remembers, was critical of Klee: \"Masson and I have both discovered Paul Klee. [[Paul \u00c9luard]] and Crevel are also interested in Klee, and they have even visited him. But Breton despises him.\"<ref>{{cite news|author=Catrin Lorch|newspaper=Frankfurter Allgemeine|date=4 January 2007|url=http://g26.ch/memo/paul_klee_01.html|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110714133553/http://g26.ch/memo/paul_klee_01.html|archivedate=14 July 2011|title=Klees feine kleine Klumpgeister|language=German|accessdate=2 October 2008}}</ref>\n\nThe art of mentally ill people inspired Klee as well as Kandinsky and Max Ernst, after [[Hans Prinzhorn]]s book ''Bildnerei der Geisteskranken'' (Artistry of the Mentally Ill) was published in 1922. In 1937, some papers from Prinzhorn's anthology were presented at the National Socialist [[propaganda]] exhibition \"[[Entartete Kunst]]\" in Munich, with the purpose of defaming the works of [[Ernst Ludwig Kirchner|Kirchner]], Klee, [[Emil Nolde|Nolde]] and other artists by likening them to the works of the insane.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.jena.de/sixcms/detail.php?id=79234&_nav_id1=58181&_nav_id2=58182&_lang=de|title=Sammlung Prinzhorn der Psychiatrischen Universit\u00e4tsklinik Heidelberg|publisher=St\u00e4dtische Museen Jena|language=German|accessdate=2 January 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131101223320/http://www.jena.de/sixcms/detail.php?id=79234&_nav_id1=58181&_nav_id2=58182&_lang=de|archive-date=1 November 2013|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\nIn 1949 [[Marcel Duchamp]] commented on Paul Klee: \"The first reaction in front of a Klee painting is the very pleasant discovery, what everyone of us could or could have done, to try drawing like in our childhood. Most of his compositions show at the first glance a plain, naive expression, found in children's drawings. [\u2026] At a second analyse one can discover a technique, which takes as a basis a large maturity in thinking. A deep understanding of dealing with watercolors to paint a personal method in oil, structured in decorative shapes, let Klee stand out in the contemporary art and make him incomparable. On the other side, his experiment was adopted in the last 30 years by many other artists as a basis for newer creations in the most different areas in painting. His extreme productivity never shows evidence of repetition, as is usually the case. He had so much to say, that a Klee never became an other Klee.\"<ref name=\"Herbert376\">Robert L.

In his \"Theses on the Philosophy of History\" Benjamin suggests that the angel depicted in the painting might be seen as representing the angel of history.\n\nAnother aspect of his legacy, and one demonstrating his multi-faceted presence in the modern artistic imagination, is his appeal for those interested in the history of the algorithm as exemplified by ''Homage to Paul Klee'' by computer art pioneer Frieder Nake.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.mdpi.com/2076-0752/8/2/69|author=Smith, Glenn|date=31 May 2019|title=An Interview with Frieder Nake|publisher=Arts|accessdate=2 June 2019}}</ref>\n\n=== Musical interpretations ===\n[[File:Paul Klee Zentrum.jpg|thumb|[[Zentrum Paul Klee]] in Bern, Switzerland, designed by [[Renzo Piano]]]]\nUnlike his taste for adventurous modern experiment in painting, Klee, though musically talented, was attracted to older traditions of music; he neither appreciated composers of the late 19th century, such as [[Richard Wagner|Wagner]], [[Anton Bruckner|Bruckner]] and [[Gustav Mahler|Mahler]], nor contemporary music. [[Johann Sebastian Bach|Bach]] and [[Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart|Mozart]] were for him the greatest composers; he most enjoyed playing the works by the latter.<ref name=\"Baumgartner208\">Beate Ofczarek, Stefan Frey: ''Chronologie einer Freundschaft''.

Regarding water policies, economic instruments comprise regulations like those creating virtual market conditions (tradable permits), charges for public services, payments for [[ecosystem services]], and transfer payments such as incentives based on taxation, levies, fees and royalties and subsidies. They represent an alternative to more traditional command and control instruments. Whereas already introduced into climate policies, air quality and energy policies, their application to water policies represents some specific challenges.\n\nIn [[Environmental Policy]], economic instruments have received increasing attention over the last decades, and have been implemented to achieve environmental policy objectives such as climate policy under the form of [[Emission Trading]]. However, although EPIs have been proved to perform better than alternative instruments (command and control instruments or voluntary agreements) in other domains of environmental policies, their application to tackle water management issues ([[drought]]/[[water scarcity]], [[flood]]s, and [[water quality]]) are beset by many difficulties both of practical and ethical character: Despite the Dublin statement on sustainable water management adopted by the UN in 1992 which stating, in its fourth principle, that \"Water has an economic value in all its competing uses and should be recognized as an economic good\"<ref>THE DUBLIN STATEMENT\nON WATER AND SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT, http://www.wmo.int/pages/prog/hwrp/documents/english/icwedece.html</ref> the conception of water as an economic (and tradable) good is not accepted unanimously; especially Human rights groups see this principle in contradiction to the [[Right to water]].\n\n== Categories of instruments ==\n\n=== Water tariffs ===\nCharges for the use of water are among the best known economic instruments for water policies. They can contribute to the transmission of  market signals which are coherent with policy aims, if their design is transparent and revenues are earmarked to uses connected to the service or to the mitigation of impacts from water uses. Charges for water uses potentially aim at different objectives: (a) redistribution the costs water service operators bear for water related services among the users,  cover costs for service provision; (b) distribute social costs of resource uses, for instance environmental costs, among users, (c) attribute water uses to the economically most efficient type of uses according to their ability to pay for water uses.\n\n== Environmental taxes ==\nTaxes on the use of water as an environmental good, for instance on the use of ground water, can help internalizing negative environmental impacts and/or collect financial resources for the public budget. The earmarking of environmental taxes (making the use of the resources collected transparent and coherent to the environmental function of the tax) is a central issue for the acceptance of the tool.\n\n== Environmental charges ==\nLike environmental taxes, charges can transmit signals for internalizing negative environmental impacts and influence behaviour, and to collect financial resources that are allocated to support environmental friendly practices and projects.\n\n=== Tradable permits ===\nAs water normally is not a traded good, the establishment of specific rights or tradeable permits are a means for using market mechanisms for the allocation of limited water resources. Creating  virtual markets tradeable permits for water uses can improve the allocation (increase the efficiency) of resources to the economically most efficient uses. Virtual markets can be created either with regards to quantities of water to be used/abstracted or levels of pollution conceded to potential polluters.\n\n{| style=\"float: right; background: #B8D2DD; border:1px solid\" margin:.46em 0 0 .2em;\" \n|+ \n !

Compensation can also be provided by third parties, for instance insurances.\n\n=== Payment for ecosystem services ===\nWater bodies provide [[ecosystem services]] consisting of [[flood protection]], [[biodiversity]] support and remediation. These functions are generally not considered as economic benefits, although they are used as inputs for social activities. [[Payment for ecosystem services|Introduction of payment schemes]] can potentially support the maintenance of natural functions of water bodies.\n\n== Evaluating Economic Policy Instruments for Water Policies ==\n\nThe [http://www.feem-project.net/epiwater/index.html EPI-WATER] research project funded by the founded by [[European Commission]] under the 7th [[Framework Programme]], sets to assess the effectiveness and the efficiency of Economic Policy Instruments in achieving water policy goals, and to identify the preconditions under which they complement or perform better than alternative (e.g. regulatory or voluntary) policy instruments. Using a common multi-dimensional assessment framework, the project will compare the performance of single economic instruments or their apposite combinations with the performance otherwise achievable with regulatory (command & control) interventions (such as water restriction/rationing, licensing or permitting), persuasive instruments or voluntary commitments. Furthermore the project will identify remaining research and methodological issues that need to be addressed, in particular with regards to the further development and use of national accounting, for supporting the design, implementation and evaluation of EPI in the field of water management.\n\nThe assessment is based on the analysis of case studies on experiences for the implementation of economic policy instruments for water policies throughout European Member states and beyond and on ex post simulation of impacts and environmental outcomes of the application of selected instruments to water policy issues in EU member states. \nThe project is coordinated by [http://www.feem.it Fondazione Eni Enrico Mattei].\n\n== References ==\n<references />\n\n[[Category:Water supply]]\n", "text_old": "{{Orphan|date=June 2013}}\n\n'''Economic Instruments''' for [[water policies]] are tools based on incentives ad disincentives; they change conditions to enable economic transactions or reduce risk, aiming at increasing [[environmental quality]].\n\nIn a world of ever increasing [[water demand]] and decline in [[water resources|water availability]] and/or reliability, where water-related hazards are on rise, where [[climate change]] threatens to undo decades of development efforts, the only way to sustainability is a right mix of mutually strengthening policy instruments.

Charges for water uses potentially aim at different objectives: (a) redistribution the costs water service operators bear for water related services among the users,  cover costs for service provision; (b) distribute social costs of resource uses, for instance environmental costs, among users, (c) attribute water uses to the economically most efficient type of uses according to their ability to pay for water uses.\n\n== Environmental taxes ==\nTaxes on the use of water as an environmental good, for instance on the use of ground water, can help internalizing negative environmental impacts and/or collect fincnacial resources for the public budget. The earmarking of environmental taxes (making the use of the resources collected transparent and coherent to the environmental function of the tax) is a central issue for the acceptance of the tool.\n\n== Environmental charges ==\nLike environmental taxes, charges can transmit signals for internalizing negative environmental impacts and influence behaviour, and to collect financial resources that are allocated to support environmental friendly practices and projects.\n\n=== Tradable permits ===\nAs water normally is not a traded good, the establishment of specific rights or tradeable permits are a means for using market mechanisms for the allocation of limited water resources. Creating  virtual markets tradeable permits for water uses can improve the allocation (increase the efficiency) of resources to the economically most efficient uses. Virtual markets can be created either with regards to quantities of water to be used/abstracted or levels of pollution conceded to potential polluters.\n\n{| style=\"float: right; background: #B8D2DD; border:1px solid\" margin:.46em 0 0 .2em;\" \n|+ \n !

Compensation can also be provided by third parties, for instance insurances.\n\n=== Payment for ecosystem services ===\nWater bodies provide [[ecosystem services]] consisting of [[flood protection]], [[biodiversity]] support and remediation. These functions are generally not considered as economic benefits, although they are used as inputs for social activities. [[Payment for ecosystem services|Introduction of payment schemes]] can potentially support the maintenance of natural functions of water bodies.\n\n== Evaluating Economic Policy Instruments for Water Policies ==\n\nThe [http://www.feem-project.net/epiwater/index.html EPI-WATER] research project funded by the founded by [[European Commission]] under the 7th [[Framework Programme]], sets to assess the effectiveness and the efficiency of Economic Policy Instruments in achieving water policy goals, and to identify the preconditions under which they complement or perform better than alternative (e.g. regulatory or voluntary) policy instruments. Using a common multi-dimensional assessment framework, the project will compare the performance of single economic instruments or their apposite combinations with the performance otherwise achievable with regulatory (command & control) interventions (such as water restriction/rationing, licensing or permitting), persuasive instruments or voluntary commitments. Furthermore the project will identify remaining research and methodological issues that need to be addressed, in particular with regards to the further development and use of national accounting, for supporting the design, implementation and evaluation of EPI in the field of water management.\n\nThe assessment is based on the analysis of case studies on experiences for the implementation of economic policy instruments for water policies throughout European Member states and beyond and on ex post simulation of impacts and environmental outcomes of the application of selected instruments to water policy issues in EU member states. \nThe project is coordinated by [http://www.feem.it Fondazione Eni Enrico Mattei].\n\n== References ==\n<references />\n\n[[Category:Water supply]]\n", "name_user": "Ira Leviton", "label": "safe", "comment": "Fixed a typo found withWikipedia:Typo_Team/moss.", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economic_Instruments_for_Water_Policies"}
