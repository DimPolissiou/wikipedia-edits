The designer of the early Pianet models was [[Ernst Zacharias]]. The Pianet was a variant of his earlier reed-based Hohner electric piano, the [[Cembalet]], which, like the Pianet, was intended for home use. Hohner offered both keyboards in their range until 1968. The Pianet production consisted of two distinctly different mechanism groups with characteristically different sound. The first group, lasting from introduction to 1977, had ground stainless steel reeds, a pick-up using variable capacitance, and leather-faced activation pads. The second group from 1977 until the end of production used rolled spring-steel reeds, electro-magnetic pick-ups, and moulded silicone rubber activation pads.\n\n==General description==\nThe Pianet is an electro-mechanical piano requiring amplification to produce a usable sound level.  Pianets in the first group of models have 61 keys and a keyboard range of F1 to F6 (43.6&nbsp;Hz \u2013 1396.9&nbsp;Hz). The second group have 60 keys and finish at E6 (1318.5&nbsp;Hz). The keyboard action is very simple. Each key is a single lever element pivoted on a fulcrum point with a spring to return it to the rest position. The key is extended at the rear so that a pad can be mounted over a tuned spring steel reed. This pad adheres to the reed when at rest, and lifts and releases the reed causing it to vibrate when the key is depressed. The vibration of the reed is converted to an electrical signal by a pick-up. The unique playing feel of a Pianet comes from the activation pads adhering to the steel reeds until they reach their point of release.\n\n==1960s Pianets==\nThe signature sound of the Pianet, the sound that brought them to prominence and popularity in early 1960s recordings, is the voice of the first production group from the Pianet to the Pianet N and Combo Pianet. This distinctive voice had the presence to cut through the increasingly louder amplified bands of the time. Pianets in this group have bass notes that growl and purr coupled with a bright percussive treble. The sound is complex and warm. The absence of any mechanism to sustain notes in a Pianet means that its sound is generally relatively staccato. The lack of blurring from sustain improves its ability to stand out in recordings.\n\nIn this first group, sound is generated by an array of 61 ground stainless steel reeds which are plucked by leather pads saturated with silicone oil. Silicone oil had the benefit of not evaporating from the leather pads, not corroding the steel reeds, and remaining at a consistent viscosity across a wide temperature range. The leather pads are mounted to aluminum rod extensions of the keys via a damping layer of urethane foam and a rubber extrusion. On pressing a key, the pad is raised and released from the reed making it vibrate. An electrostatic pick-up consisting of a segmented vertical plate mounted orthogonal to and just beyond the ends of the reeds transmits the sound to an [[amplifier]]. The Pianet's sound was piano-like, sharing sonic similarities to the Wurlitzer series of electric pianos as both relied on metal reeds and variable capacitance as their sound generation source.\n<!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Hohner Pianet L.jpg|thumb|right|The Pianet L from the Hohner A190 product catalogue 1961]] -->\n[[File:Hohner Pianet N Version II.jpg|thumb|right|Pianet N (Version II). This is a US voltage model sold around 1968.]]\n[[File:Hohner Combo Pianet circa 1976.jpg|thumb|right|Hohner Combo Pianet sold from 1972 onward.]]\n\nDuring its period of manufacture, the Pianet evolved through a number of model changes. These included both self-amplified versions and versions that required the use of an external amplifier and speaker. The most numerous model, the Pianet N, evolved through two different specifications. The N had side-mounted \u2018inverted-V\u2019 legs, and could be equipped with an optional 12-watt valve amplifier, the Amplifier CP, which mounted below the unit in front of the player's knees. The Pianet N (version II) was joined by the Combo Pianet in 1972. These were the final incarnations of the first group of Pianets.\n \nThe early 1960s Pianets (Pianet, Pianet C, Pianet CH, and Pianet N) featured lids which opened in an upright 'V' to form a music stand. This feature was introduced on [[Cembalet]]s and became common to both Cembalets and Pianets. This similarity of appearance results in the misidentification of models in historic images. The C and N models were equipped with a vibrato circuit operated by a switch mounted next to the keyboard. The Pianet L had no additional effects and used a knee lever to control the volume.  The N models used a variable-resistance volume pedal cabled to a socket on the rear of the keyboard. The Pianet soon found popularity with music groups of the 1960s, leading Hohner to produce the Combo Pianet model in the early 1970s. It was designed for the performing musician, without legs, and intended to be sat on top of an [[organ (music)|organ]] or [[piano|acoustic piano]].\n\n==Late 1970s Pianets==\n[[image:Hohner Pianet.jpg|thumb|Hohner Pianet T]]\nIn the late 1970s Hohner produced the second group of models and ceased production of the Pianet N and Combo Pianet. The second group consisted of two models, the Pianet T and M, and a hybrid version combined with a Clavinet, the Pianet/Clavinet Duo. These featured a change in design from electrostatic pick-ups and leather and foam pads to electromagnetic pick-ups (like the [[Rhodes piano]]) and silicone rubber pads. The reeds were also changed from the ground finish of the earlier type to a smooth milled finish. This resulted in a different sound, mellower than that of the early models, better suited to the sounds of the late 1970s/early 1980s. While popular with semi-pro musicians due to its low price and portability, the Pianet T made a limited impact on major recording artists. The M model, designed for home use, was built with a wooden console case with internal speakers and a phaser effect circuit. The T model, most commonly found on the used market today, was built for the gigging musician. It had an optional stand and, in a departure from earlier models finished in wood veneer, is finished in black vinyl leathercloth. Its final incarnation came in the Hohner Pianet/Clavinet Duo model which combined a Hohner Clavinet (essentially an electric [[clavichord]]) with the Pianet T in one compact (albeit heavy) instrument. Production ceased by the early 1980s.\n\n==Models==\nDuring the production life of the Pianet the case, mechanical features and electronics changed to keep pace with developments in electronics manufacture, reductions in manufacturing costs, and fashion. Changes to the Pianet coordinated with [[Cembalet]] production changes from the C models onward. Dating the manufacturing envelope and availability of the various Pianet models is confused by undated sales literature and differing sales availability of models between Europe and the United States.\n\n===Pianet===\nApproximate manufacturing span 1962\u20131963\n\nThe Pianet has a case side profile with a taper towards the front.

The control panels at the left hand end of the instrument include keyboard splits and mixtures of the two instruments as well as normal Clavinet mixture controls.\n\n==Users==\nEarly Pianets were used on a number of hit recordings from the 1960s and 1970s, including \"[[She's Not There]]\" by [[The Zombies]]; \"[[Louie Louie]]\" by [[The Kingsmen]]; \"[[I Am the Walrus]]\", \"[[Getting Better]]\", \"[[The Night Before (song)|The Night Before]]\", \"[[Tell Me What You See]]\", \"[[You Like Me Too Much]]\" by [[The Beatles]];  \"[[This Guy's in Love With You]]\" by [[Herb Alpert]]; \"[[These Eyes]]\" by [[The Guess Who]]; and \"[[Joy to the World (Three Dog Night song)|Joy to the World]]\" by [[Three Dog Night]].  In the [[glam rock]] era, the Pianet was used by [[Bryan Ferry]] on the first few [[Roxy Music]] albums, for instance featuring prominently in their hit ''[[Editions of You]]''. It was a staple of the \"classic lineup\" sound of [[Curved Air]] (1970\u20131972), featuring prominently on their first 3 albums, played by both guitarist/keyboardist [[Francis Monkman]] and violinist [[Darryl Way]]. The 1972\u201374 lineup of [[progressive rock]] pioneers [[King Crimson]] used a pair of Pianets in live performance, played both by the group's violinist [[David Cross (musician)|David Cross]], and the guitarist, [[Robert Fripp]]{{ref|1}}. [[Tony Banks (musician)|Tony Banks]] of [[Genesis (band)|Genesis]] used one prominently on the group's first four albums, as a lead instrument through a homemade fuzz box and to simulate piano sounds onstage.\n\n[[Fleetwood Mac]]'s [[Christine McVie]] was a noted proponent of the Pianet N and Combo Pianet from the first group of products. In an article written by Bob Doerschuk in the October 1980 issue of ''Contemporary Keyboard'' she outlined why she preferred the sound of the 1960s Pianets and why she eventually replaced them.\n\nThe Pianet is enjoying a renaissance (e.g. [[Bugge Wesseltoft]]'s ''Change'') due to its unique sound and the availability of new pads for the earlier models, most of which had been reduced to unplayability due to pad decay. It is also popular as a substitute for the [[Wurlitzer electric piano]], which has a related reed-based mechanism for generating sound but is typically much heavier, requires more maintenance than the Pianet, and is overall more expensive.\n\n==Restoration issues==\nFor two decades in the 1980s and 90s replacement parts for Pianets became progressively harder to find because they were no longer being supported by Hohner. The principal problem was the activation pads for the first group of Pianets, the 1960s instruments. [[Polyurethane|Urethane]] foam was used as the damper behind the leather surface of the pad. The urethane decomposed with age, making the pads unusable. Hohner intended the pads to be a service-replaceable item (like the strings of a guitar). Restorers and players who wanted to keep a Pianet working were obliged to manufacture their own pads. The second group of Pianets, the T and M, used [[silicone rubber]] for their pads. They have aged extremely well and are still functional in most keyboards, as of 2012. The silicone pads of the T & M are not suitable for the 1960s Pianets. Their adhesion properties don't suit the ground reeds of the first group of instruments, and they produce a static discharge that is amplified by the capacitive pick-up of the instrument. In the 2000s, a number of businesses took up the servicing and maintenance of vintage keyboards, so pads suitable for both groups of Pianets are now available.\n\nThe mechanical structure of keys, pivot rail, reeds, reed bar and pick-up are the same in the 1960s Pianets from the \"Mk.1\" and C to the Combo, so spares to get a Pianet working can come from most models. While the electronics differ from model to model, they can be exchanged if the aim is to make a keyboard playable rather than to restore it.\n\n==References==\n\n* {{cite web |title=Robert Fripp's Diary: Tuesday, 15th September 1998 |url=http://www.dgmlive.com/diaries.htm?entry=1592 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141013205400/http://www.dgmlive.com/diaries.htm?entry=1592 |archivedate=13 October 2014 |url-status=dead}}\n*[https://www.classickeysbook.com/ Classic Keys: Keyboard sounds that launched rock music] (12/2019), Alan Lenhoff and David Robertson\n\n==Bibliography==\n*Vintage Synthesizers by Mark Vail, Backbeat Books, 1993 & 2000, {{ISBN|0-87930-603-3}} \u2013 Chapter on Electric Pianos, Harpsichords & Clavichords of the 50s & 60s by Barry Carson.\n\n==External links==\n*[http://from.ph/319869 Pressed+metal 2003/228/1 Electric keyboard, Hohner Pianet, timber / metal / plastic, designed by Ernst Zacharias, made by Hohner AG, West Germany, 1962\u20131970 Powerhouse Museum, Sydney, Australia]\n*[http://www.vintageaudioberlin.de/vabgalerien_2/tasteninstrumente_elektronisch/Hohner_Pianet_T/index.htm Detail pictures of a Pianet T and a Cembalet.]\n*[http://www.clavinet.com Manufactures replacement pads for all Pianets]\n*[http://kenrichsounds.com/index.html Manufactures replica replacement pads for group one 1960s Pianets C, L, N (versions I & II), Combo Pianet.]\n*[http://bla.fleetwoodmac.net/index.php?page=index_v2&id=11&c=2 Contemporary Keyboard (10/1980), Christine McVie]\n\n[[Category:Electric pianos]]\n[[Category:The Beatles' musical instruments]]\n", "text_old": "<!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Hohner Pianet C from a 1961 product range catalogue.jpg|thumb|right|The Pianet C from the Hohner A190 product catalogue 1961]] -->\n{{no footnotes|date=September 2012}}\nThe '''Pianet''' is a type of [[electric piano|electro-mechanical piano]] built by the [[Hohner]] company of [[Trossingen]], [[West Germany]], from the early 1960s to the early 1980s.

These included both self-amplified versions and versions that required the use of an external amplifier and speaker. The most numerous model, the Pianet N, evolved through two different specifications. The N had side-mounted \u2018inverted-V\u2019 legs, and could be equipped with an optional 12-watt valve amplifier, the Amplifier CP, which mounted below the unit in front of the player's knees. The Pianet N (version II) was joined by the Combo Pianet in 1972. These were the final incarnations of the first group of Pianets.\n \nThe early 1960s Pianets (Pianet, Pianet C, Pianet CH, and Pianet N) featured lids which opened in an upright 'V' to form a music stand. This feature was introduced on [[Cembalet]]s and became common to both Cembalets and Pianets. This similarity of appearance results in the misidentification of models in historic images. The C and N models were equipped with a vibrato circuit operated by a switch mounted next to the keyboard. The Pianet L had no additional effects and used a knee lever to control the volume.  The N models used a variable-resistance volume pedal cabled to a socket on the rear of the keyboard. The Pianet soon found popularity with music groups of the 1960s, leading Hohner to produce the Combo Pianet model in the early 1970s. It was designed for the performing musician, without legs, and intended to be sat on top of an [[organ (music)|organ]] or [[piano|acoustic piano]].\n\n==Late 1970s Pianets==\n[[image:Hohner Pianet.jpg|thumb|Hohner Pianet T]]\nIn the late 1970s Hohner produced the second group of models and ceased production of the Pianet N and Combo Pianet. The second group consisted of two models, the Pianet T and M, and a hybrid version combined with a Clavinet, the Pianet/Clavinet Duo. These featured a change in design from electrostatic pick-ups and leather and foam pads to electromagnetic pick-ups (like the [[Rhodes piano]]) and silicone rubber pads. The reeds were also changed from the ground finish of the earlier type to a smooth milled finish. This resulted in a different sound, mellower than that of the early models, better suited to the sounds of the late 1970s/early 1980s. While popular with semi-pro musicians due to its low price and portability, the Pianet T made a limited impact on major recording artists. The M model, designed for home use, was built with a wooden console case with internal speakers and a phaser effect circuit. The T model, most commonly found on the used market today, was built for the gigging musician. It had an optional stand and, in a departure from earlier models finished in wood veneer, is finished in black vinyl leathercloth. Its final incarnation came in the Hohner Pianet/Clavinet Duo model which combined a Hohner Clavinet (essentially an electric [[clavichord]]) with the Pianet T in one compact (albeit heavy) instrument. Production ceased by the early 1980s.\n\n==Models==\nDuring the production life of the Pianet the case, mechanical features and electronics changed to keep pace with developments in electronics manufacture, reductions in manufacturing costs, and fashion. Changes to the Pianet coordinated with [[Cembalet]] production changes from the C models onward.

It has a transistorised pre-amplifier and a volume control knob is fitted at the left end of the keyboard.\n\n===Pianet T===\nApproximate manufacturing span 1977\u20131983\n\nThe Pianet T has a rectangular case profile with rounded corners and a hinged integral lid with central handle. With the lid latched closed the instrument forms its own carry case. The body of the case is covered with black vinyl leathercloth and the ends are padded with vinyl-skinned urethane foam. There are no legs supplied as standard. An optional stand can be fixed to threaded mounting points on the ends of the case. The keys are injection-moulded plastic over pressed metal frames. The words 'Pianet T' are screen printed in silver on the rear of the case and on the inside surface of the lid.\n\n===Pianet M===\nApproximate manufacturing span 1977\u20131983\n\nThe Pianet M has the Pianet T mechanism built into a rectilinear wood grain console case. There is no lid over the keys. Sitting above the box that holds the playing mechanism is an amplifier housing with a sloped front face and two player facing cloth speaker-grills. An acrylic music rest slots into the top of this housing. The leg panels are wood-grained boards finished with a timber foot and joined by a horizontal wood grained panel. The word 'Hohner' is printed in gold centrally above the keys. The model 'Pianet \u2013 M' is printed on the amplifier cover panel at the rear. Built in Hohner Modulator, another invention of Ernst Zacharias.\n\n===Pianet/Clavinet Duo===\nApproximate manufacturing span 1978\u20131983\n\nThis hybrid model uses a black case in the style of a [[Clavinet]] E7. The Duo has a rectangular case profile with rounded corners and a removable lid to protect the keys and control surface for transport. Samples can be found with both versions of the name: Pianet Clavinet Duo and Clavinet Pianet Duo. The control panels at the left hand end of the instrument include keyboard splits and mixtures of the two instruments as well as normal Clavinet mixture controls.\n\n==Users==\nEarly Pianets were used on a number of hit recordings from the 1960s and 1970s, including \"[[She's Not There]]\" by [[The Zombies]]; \"[[Louie Louie]]\" by [[The Kingsmen]]; \"[[I Am the Walrus]]\", \"[[Getting Better]]\", \"[[The Night Before (song)|The Night Before]]\", \"[[Tell Me What You See]]\", \"[[You Like Me Too Much]]\" by [[The Beatles]];  \"[[This Guy's in Love With You]]\" by [[Herb Alpert]]; \"[[These Eyes]]\" by [[The Guess Who]]; and \"[[Joy to the World (Three Dog Night song)|Joy to the World]]\" by [[Three Dog Night]].  In the [[glam rock]] era, the Pianet was used by [[Bryan Ferry]] on the first few [[Roxy Music]] albums, for instance featuring prominently in their hit ''[[Editions of You]]''. It was a staple of the \"classic lineup\" sound of [[Curved Air]] (1970\u20131972), featuring prominently on their first 3 albums, played by both guitarist/keyboardist [[Francis Monkman]] and violinist [[Darryl Way]]. The 1972\u201374 lineup of [[progressive rock]] pioneers [[King Crimson]] used a pair of Pianets in live performance, played both by the group's violinist [[David Cross (musician)|David Cross]], and the guitarist, [[Robert Fripp]]{{ref|1}}. [[Tony Banks (musician)|Tony Banks]] of [[Genesis (band)|Genesis]] used one prominently on the group's first four albums, as a lead instrument through a homemade fuzz box and to simulate piano sounds onstage.\n\n[[Fleetwood Mac]]'s [[Christine McVie]] was a noted proponent of the Pianet N and Combo Pianet from the first group of products. In an article written by Bob Doerschuk in the October 1980 issue of ''Contemporary Keyboard'' she outlined why she preferred the sound of the 1960s Pianets and why she eventually replaced them.\n\nThe Pianet is enjoying a renaissance (e.g. [[Bugge Wesseltoft]]'s ''Change'') due to its unique sound and the availability of new pads for the earlier models, most of which had been reduced to unplayability due to pad decay. It is also popular as a substitute for the [[Wurlitzer electric piano]], which has a related reed-based mechanism for generating sound but is typically much heavier, requires more maintenance than the Pianet, and is overall more expensive.\n\n==Restoration issues==\nFor two decades in the 1980s and 90s replacement parts for Pianets became progressively harder to find because they were no longer being supported by Hohner. The principal problem was the activation pads for the first group of Pianets, the 1960s instruments. [[Polyurethane|Urethane]] foam was used as the damper behind the leather surface of the pad. The urethane decomposed with age, making the pads unusable. Hohner intended the pads to be a service-replaceable item (like the strings of a guitar). Restorers and players who wanted to keep a Pianet working were obliged to manufacture their own pads. The second group of Pianets, the T and M, used [[silicone rubber]] for their pads. They have aged extremely well and are still functional in most keyboards, as of 2012. The silicone pads of the T & M are not suitable for the 1960s Pianets. Their adhesion properties don't suit the ground reeds of the first group of instruments, and they produce a static discharge that is amplified by the capacitive pick-up of the instrument. In the 2000s, a number of businesses took up the servicing and maintenance of vintage keyboards, so pads suitable for both groups of Pianets are now available.\n\nThe mechanical structure of keys, pivot rail, reeds, reed bar and pick-up are the same in the 1960s Pianets from the \"Mk.1\" and C to the Combo, so spares to get a Pianet working can come from most models. While the electronics differ from model to model, they can be exchanged if the aim is to make a keyboard playable rather than to restore it.\n\n==References==\n\n* {{cite web |title=Robert Fripp's Diary: Tuesday, 15th September 1998 |url=http://www.dgmlive.com/diaries.htm?entry=1592 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141013205400/http://www.dgmlive.com/diaries.htm?entry=1592 |archivedate=13 October 2014 |url-status=dead}}\n\n==Bibliography==\n*Vintage Synthesizers by Mark Vail, Backbeat Books, 1993 & 2000, {{ISBN|0-87930-603-3}} \u2013 Chapter on Electric Pianos, Harpsichords & Clavichords of the 50s & 60s by Barry Carson.\n\n==External links==\n*[http://from.ph/319869 Pressed+metal 2003/228/1 Electric keyboard, Hohner Pianet, timber / metal / plastic, designed by Ernst Zacharias, made by Hohner AG, West Germany, 1962\u20131970 Powerhouse Museum, Sydney, Australia]\n*[http://www.vintageaudioberlin.de/vabgalerien_2/tasteninstrumente_elektronisch/Hohner_Pianet_T/index.htm Detail pictures of a Pianet T and a Cembalet.]\n*[http://www.clavinet.com Manufactures replacement pads for all Pianets]\n*[http://kenrichsounds.com/index.html Manufactures replica replacement pads for group one 1960s Pianets C, L, N (versions I & II), Combo Pianet.]\n*[http://bla.fleetwoodmac.net/index.php?page=index_v2&id=11&c=2 Contemporary Keyboard (10/1980), Christine McVie]\n*[https://www.classickeysbook.com/ Classic Keys: Keyboard sounds that launched rock music] (12/2019), Alan Lenhoff and David Robertson\n\n[[Category:Electric pianos]]\n[[Category:The Beatles' musical instruments]]\n", "name_user": "Rodak98", "label": "safe", "comment": "Moved book reference out of Links and into Bibliography", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pianet"}

It is also used by [[Presbyterians]], [[Moravian Church|Moravians]], [[Methodists]] and [[Congregational church|Congregationalists]].\n\nThe Apostles' Creed is [[Trinity|trinitarian]] in structure with sections affirming belief in [[God the Father]], [[God the Son]] and [[Holy Spirit in Christianity|God the Holy Spirit]]<ref>{{Cite book|last=Bayes|first=Jonathan F.|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=y5FMAwAAQBAJ&pg=PA22&lpg=PA22&dq=The+Apostles'+Creed+is+trinitarian+in+structure+with+sections+affirming+belief+in+God+the+Father,+God+the+Son+and+God+the+Holy+Spirit&source=bl&ots=LlEdVomgjC&sig=ACfU3U3ABZnPJmgUlY96f5f0SBV_Ak9Zgg&hl=en&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwih9Puj0qnoAhXJMMAKHcB1BjoQ6AEwDXoECAoQAQ#v=onepage&q=The%20Apostles'%20Creed%20is%20trinitarian%20in%20structure%20with%20sections%20affirming%20belief%20in%20God%20the%20Father,%20God%20the%20Son%20and%20God%20the%20Holy%20Spirit&f=false|title=The Apostles' Creed: Truth with Passion|date=2010-09-09|publisher=Wipf and Stock Publishers|isbn=978-1-60899-539-4|language=en}}</ref>. The Apostles' Creed was based on Christian theological understanding of the [[canonical gospels]], the letters of the [[New Testament]] and to a lesser extent the [[Old Testament]]. Its basis appears to be the old Roman Creed known also as the [[Old Roman Symbol]].\n\nBecause of the early origin of its original form, it does not address some [[Christology|Christological]] issues defined in the [[Nicene Creed|Nicene]] and other [[List of Christian creeds|Christian creeds]]. It thus says nothing explicitly about the [[Divinity of Jesus|divinity]] of either [[Jesus]] or the Holy Spirit. Nor does it address many other theological questions which became objects of dispute centuries later.\n\nThe earliest known mention of the expression \"Apostles' Creed\" occurs in a letter of AD&nbsp;390 from a [[Synod of Milan|synod in Milan]] and may have been associated with the belief, widely accepted in the 4th century, that, under the inspiration of the Holy Spirit, each of the [[Twelve Apostles]] contributed an article to the twelve articles of the creed.<ref>{{Citation | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=gqrEpBuBGIgC&pg=PA63 | first = Jack | last = Rogers | title =

In the fourth line, it replaced the personal pronoun \"he\" with the relative \"who\", and changed the punctuation, so as no longer to present the Creed as a series of separate statements. In the same line it removed the words \"the power of\".

In the official English translation ([[International Commission on English in the Liturgy|ICEL]], 1974) the minister of baptism asks:\n:Do you believe in God, the Father almighty, creator of heaven and earth?\n:Do you believe in Jesus Christ, his only Son, our Lord, who was born of the Virgin Mary, was crucified, died, and was buried, rose from the dead, and is now seated at the right hand of the Father?\n:Do you believe in the Holy Spirit, the holy catholic Church, the communion of saints, the forgiveness of sins, the resurrection of the body, and life everlasting?\n\nTo each question, the catechumen, or, in the case of an infant, the parents and sponsor(s) (godparent(s)) in his or her place, answers \"I do.\" Then the celebrant says:\n:This is our faith. This is the faith of the Church. We are proud to profess it, in Christ Jesus our Lord.\n\nAnd all respond: Amen.\n\nThe [[Presbyterian Church of Aotearoa New Zealand]] uses the Apostles' Creed in its baptism rite in spite of the reservations of some of its members regarding the phrase \"born of the virgin Mary\".<ref>[https://knoxchurch.net/2015/09/30/why-use-the-apostles-creed-in-a-baptism/ Knox Church Dunedin: \"Why use the Apostles\u2019 Creed in a baptism?\"]</ref>\n\nThe [[Episcopal Church in the United States of America]] uses the Apostles' Creed as part of a Baptismal Covenant for those who are to receive the Rite of Baptism.

F. S. Grundtvig|Grundtvig]]. See [[:da:Den apostolske trosbekendelse|Den apostolske trosbekendelse]].\n\n===United Methodist Church===\nThe [[United Methodist Church|United Methodists]] commonly incorporate the Apostles' Creed into their worship services.

Nashville: The Methodist Publishing House. #738.</ref>\n\nHowever, when the Methodist Episcopal Church was organized in the United States in 1784, John Wesley sent the new American Church a Sunday Service which included the phrase \"he descended into hell\" in the text of The Apostles' Creed.  <ref>Wesley, John (1784). \"The Sunday Service of the Methodists in North America with other Occasional Services,\" p. 12.</ref> It is clear that Wesley intended American Methodists to use the phrase in the recitation of the Creed. \n\nThe ''United Methodist Hymnal'' of 1989 also contains (at #882) what it terms the \"Ecumenical Version\" of this creed which is the ecumenically accepted modern translation of the International Committee on English Texts (1975) as amended by the subsequent successor body, the English Language Liturgical Consultation (1987).<ref>{{Citation | chapter = The Worship Resources | title = United Methodist Hymnal | editor-first = Hoyt | editor-last = Hickman | year = 1989 | page = 200}}.</ref> This form of the Apostles' Creed can be found incorporated into the Eucharistic and Baptismal Liturgies in the Hymnal and in ''The United Methodist Book of Worship'', and hence it is growing in popularity and use. The word \"catholic\" is intentionally left lowercase in the sense that the word catholic applies to the universal and ecumenical Christian church.\n\n:I believe in God the Father Almighty,\n::maker of heaven and earth;\n\n:And in Jesus Christ, his only Son, our Lord, \n::who was conceived by the Holy Spirit, \n::born of the Virgin Mary, \n::suffered under Pontius Pilate, \n::was crucified, died, and was buried;\n::he descended to the dead.\n::On the third day he rose again; \n::he ascended into heaven, \n::is seated at the right hand of the Father, \n::and will come again to judge the living and the dead.\n\n:I believe in the Holy Spirit,\n::the holy catholic church,\n::the communion of saints,\n::the forgiveness of sins,\n::the resurrection of the body \n::and the life everlasting.

In the official English translation ([[International Commission on English in the Liturgy|ICEL]], 1974) the minister of baptism asks:\n:Do you believe in God, the Father almighty, creator of heaven and earth?\n:Do you believe in Jesus Christ, his only Son, our Lord, who was born of the Virgin Mary, was crucified, died, and was buried, rose from the dead, and is now seated at the right hand of the Father?\n:Do you believe in the Holy Spirit, the holy catholic Church, the communion of saints, the forgiveness of sins, the resurrection of the body, and life everlasting?\n\nTo each question, the catechumen, or, in the case of an infant, the parents and sponsor(s) (godparent(s)) in his or her place, answers \"I do.\" Then the celebrant says:\n:This is our faith. This is the faith of the Church. We are proud to profess it, in Christ Jesus our Lord.\n\nAnd all respond: Amen.\n\nThe [[Presbyterian Church of Aotearoa New Zealand]] uses the Apostles' Creed in its baptism rite in spite of the reservations of some of its members regarding the phrase \"born of the virgin Mary\".<ref>[https://knoxchurch.net/2015/09/30/why-use-the-apostles-creed-in-a-baptism/ Knox Church Dunedin: \"Why use the Apostles\u2019 Creed in a baptism?\"]</ref>\n\nThe [[Episcopal Church in the United States of America]] uses the Apostles' Creed as part of a Baptismal Covenant for those who are to receive the Rite of Baptism. The Apostles' Creed is recited by candidates, sponsors and congregation, each section of the Creed being an answer to the celebrant's question, \"Do you believe in God the Father (God the Son, God the Holy Spirit)?\"<ref>{{cite book|title=\"Holy Baptism,\" The (Online) Book of Common Prayer|date=1979|publisher=The Episcopal Church|edition=revised 2007|url=https://www.bcponline.org/Baptism/holybaptism.html|accessdate=22 April 2018}}</ref> It is also used in an interrogative form at the [[Easter Vigil]] in The Renewal of Baptismal Vows.<ref>''The Book of Common Prayer'' (1979).
