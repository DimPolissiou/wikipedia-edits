These guidelines mention, for the first time in China's formal policy and regulations, the words \"animal welfare\".<ref name=\":02\">{{Cite book|title=Animals in China: Law and Society|last=Cao|first=Deborah|publisher=The Palgrave Macmillan|year=2015|isbn=|location=New York|pages=}}</ref> This regulation was issued in addition to other laboratory animal-related policies in China like the 1988 Statute on the Administration of Laboratory Animals, 1997 Laboratory Animal Development Program for the Ninth Five-Year Plan, the 2005 Guidelines on Beijing Municipality on the Review of Welfare and Ethics of Laboratory Animals.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Kong|first=Qi|last2=Qin|first2=Chuan|date=2010|title=Analysis of Current Laboratory Animal Science Policies and Administration in China|url=|journal=ILAR e-Journal|volume=51|pages=|pmid=20075493}}</ref> Unlike the 1988 Statute on the Administration of Laboratory Animals which focuses solely on controlling the quality of the laboratory animals being tested on, the Guidelines on the Humane Treatment of Laboratory Animals officially expands into the realm of animal welfare and protection through addressing problems in procurement, husbandry, environmental conditions, experimental usage and transportation.<ref name=\":02\" />\n\nA particular focus that the Guidelines on the Humane Treatment of Laboratory Animals has is on animal suffering. Concerning the level of pain that laboratory animals feel during the experimental process, the Guidelines require that pain and panic be inflicted as little as possible. Pain relief medication and anesthesia must be prescribed to laboratory animals undergoing procedures like surgery and dissection.<ref name=\":02\" /> When the animal is deemed unusable for further testing, the Guidelines also require that the lives of the animals be ended humanely.<ref name=\":02\" />\n\nMany scientists like Jianfei Wang, the director of laboratory animal science at GlaxoSmithKline Research and Development Center in China, maintain that China has made considerable progress to work towards animal protection and welfare, especially considering that the concept of laboratory animal science did not exist in China until the late twentieth century.<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite journal|last=|first=|date=2012|title=International Animal Research Regulations: Impact on Neuroscience Research: Workshop Summary: The Evolving Regulatory Environment|url=|department=Institute of Medicine|journal=National Academies Press|volume=|pages=|via=Institute of Medicine}}</ref> According to Wang, international collaboration with research institutions have brought animal welfare concepts from abroad back to China.<ref name=\":1\" /> Additionally, as China gets more involved in international trade, there are many pressures placed on China throughout the world over concerns for animal welfare and protection. For example, organizations like PETA were instrumental with stopping a shipment research primates from Chinese laboratories to Los Angeles, the U.S.'s largest port of entry for research primates.<ref name=\":2\">{{Cite journal|last=Lu|first=Jiaqi|last2=Bayne|first2=Kathryn|last3=Wang|first3=Jianfei|date=2013|title=Current Status of Animal Welfare and Animal Rights in China|url=|journal=Association for Assessment and Accreditation of Laboratory Animal Care International|volume=|pages=|via=ATLA}}</ref> Major airlines such as Air China and China Eastern Airlines have also joined in on the global challenge of stopping laboratory tests on animals like primates and rodents.<ref name=\":2\" /> China's entry in the World Trade Organization could also be stymied if adequate progress is not made towards pressuring Chinese laboratories to follow international regulations for laboratory animal welfare.\n\nChina has also felt domestic pressures to give laboratory animals more protection. In 2007, a photo taken by Li Feng depicting captive primates in cages waiting to be tested on won prizes in the economy and science categories in the China International Press Photo Contest.<ref name=\":02\" /> Such glimpses into the conditions that laboratory animals in China are subject to have sparked outrage amongst the Chinese population and cries for further reform.\n\nDespite foreign and domestic pressures, the country still uses, on average, about 12 to 13 million laboratory animals every year, with many being used towards making advances in drug and medical discovery.<ref name=\":02\" /><ref name=\":2\" /> Because international research institutions and companies face strict laws regarding ensuring the welfare of laboratory animals, many of these institutions and companies look towards China as the place to outsource animal testing and as a market for buying research animals.<ref name=\":02\" />\n\nHowever, some animals are also being tested for cosmetic purposes as well. China has a $32 billion beauty market, and over 300,000 animals are thought to be used each year for required product tests.<ref name=\"LinBeauty2013\">{{cite news|last1=Lin|first1=Liza|title=An Ugly Dilemma for Beauty Companies|url=http://www.businessweek.com/articles/2013-09-26/cosmetics-makers-dilemma-animal-testing-rules-differ-in-china-europe|accessdate=16 July 2014|agency=Bloomberg Businessweek|date=26 Sep 2013}}</ref> China is the only major buyer where mascaras and lotions need to be tested on animals.<ref name=\"LinBeauty2013\" />\n\n{{Quote box\n|quote = \"Our R&D isn't as sophisticated, and the consumer here doesn't think as much about ideals such as animal testing.

It had been previously run by the [[Cardiff Tramway Company]]. The resultant [[Cardiff Corporation Tramways]] spent the next three decades extending its electric tram network, and at its peak in 1927 ran 141 electric trams over 18 miles of line. On Christmas Eve 1920, the corporation introduced its first bus, although the first motor bus route was operated by the Tramway Company from 1907.<ref name=History>[http://www.cardiffbus.com/english/page.shtml?pageid=361#_subnav04 The Cardiff Story], Cardiff Bus. Retrieved 19 October 2017.</ref>\n\nThe first [[Trolleybuses in Cardiff|Cardiff trolleybuses]] were introduced in 1942, their introduction having been delayed by the outbreak of [[World War II]]. The intention was to convert the remaining tramway system to trolleybus operation, then to extend the network. While the first stage was completed in 1950, the only extension made to the system was to [[Ely, Cardiff|Ely]] which took place in 1955. Although powers had been obtained to considerably expand the network, a policy U-turn occurred in 1961 when the decision was made to replace all the trolleybuses with motor buses. This task was completed in 1970, bringing to an end 68 years of electric traction on the streets of Cardiff.<ref name=History/>\n\nThe [[Transport Act 1985|Transport Act of 1985]] [[bus deregulation|deregulated bus services]] outside London and required all Local Authorities to establish private \"arm's length\" bus companies. In October 1986 the council established a subsidiary company.<ref name=company2001229>[http://data.companieshouse.gov.uk/doc/company/02001229 Companies House extract company no 2001229] Cardiff City Transport Services Limited</ref> In 1992, the closure of the National Welsh bus company led Cardiff Bus to extend and intensify its network in the areas and towns surrounding Cardiff, including [[Barry, Wales|Barry]], the [[Vale of Glamorgan]] and [[Caerphilly]]. The Caerphilly local network of services including links between Cardiff, Caerphilly, [[Blackwood, Caerphilly|Blackwood]] and [[Tredegar]] were discontinued in 2001 and are now provided by [[Stagecoach Wales|Stagecoach in South Wales]].\n\nSome loss-making services have been withdrawn and are now operated under local authority tender by other operators, including Watts Coaches and [[NAT Group]].\n\nFrom September 2016, four of Cardiff Bus' services (routes 51/53, 86 and X91) were transferred to its new Capital Links sister brand,<ref>{{cite web|title=Capital Links|url=http://www.cardiffbus.com/english/article.shtml?articleid=6016|website=Cardiff Bus|publisher=Cardiff Bus|accessdate=23 July 2017}}{{Dead link|date=April 2019 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref> with a further four services transferring over to Capital Links two months later.<ref>{{cite web|title=New Routes for Capital Links|url=http://www.capitallinks.co.uk/article.shtml?articleid=6215|website=Capital Links|publisher=Capital Links|accessdate=23 July 2017}}{{Dead link|date=April 2019 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref> Vehicles used on these services are in either an orange or green base livery, and as of July 2017, Capital Links operate seven routes.\n\n==Operations==\nCardiff Bus has a turnover of \u00a327million, employs around 705 people, on an average weekday carries around 100,000 passengers.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wtuclearn.org.uk/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=86&Itemid=49|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150610221345/http://www.wtuclearn.org.uk/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=86&Itemid=49|url-status=dead|archive-date=10 June 2015|title=Staff turnover plummets to record low levels|publisher=TUC Wales|accessdate=2 November 2008}}</ref> In 2009 the company started to operate the park and ride service from Cardiff City Stadium to the city centre.\n\n===Fares===\nCardiff Bus operates an exact fare policy and no change is given. The city used to be divided into four fare zones, but on 5 April 2009, Cardiff Bus introduced a flat fare of \u00a31.60 for a one-way journey or \u00a33.20 for all-day travel in Cardiff and Penarth, or \u00a31.40/\u00a32.80 for travel within Barry. This has since been increased to \u00a32.00 for a one-way journey or \u00a34.00 for all-day travel in Cardiff and Penarth, or \u00a31.90 and \u00a33.80 in Barry (\u00a33.20/\u00a35.50 Cardiff and Barry). A weekly ticket can be purchased for travel within Cardiff for \u00a315, but an \"iff card\" will need to be presented as this type of ticket is not printed out on their machine. Tickets can also be purchased on the mobile app (available for iOS and Android).\nSpecial fares apply for travel between Cardiff and Barry.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cardiffbus.com/english/faresandtickets.shtml#_subnav02|title=Our Fares|publisher=Cardiff Bus|accessdate=20 October 2017}}</ref> Special fares also apply for Newport, with a \u00a34.50 return ticket offered along with the Day to Go Plus ticket also being accepted.\n\n===Iff card===\n{{main|Iff card}}\n\nIff card is a [[contactless smart card]] introduced by Cardiff Bus in October 2010, allowing customers to travel on its services after having pre-paid. The first 30,000 cards were issued free of charge and preloaded with \u00a33 of credit, after which the cards will be charged at \u00a35.\n\nAn amount of money is electronically loaded onto the card, either upon boarding a bus or at the Cardiff Bus customer service centre. A passenger then chooses a ticket type. The card can also be used as a season ticket. The card should be topped-up when the balance is low, however, the card allows the customer to acquire a negative balance up to \u00a33.<ref>[http://www.cardiffbus.com/smartcard.shtml Smartcard] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101007204320/http://www.cardiffbus.com/smartcard.shtml |date=7 October 2010 }} Cardiff Bus</ref>\n\nThe card can be topped-up in units of \u00a31, \u00a32, \u00a33, \u00a34, \u00a35, \u00a310, \u00a315 or \u00a320, up to maximum amount of \u00a350.

Single deck vehicles dominate the fleet, accounting for 90.7% of the overall fleet. Since 2013, 90 brand new vehicles have been purchased, with the most recent being delivered in August 2017.\n\nOn the double deck side of the fleet, of which there are 23 vehicles, ten high capacity [[Alexander Dennis Enviro400]]s joined the fleet in 2015. Prior to the delivery of the former, thirteen [[East Lancs Olympus]] bodied [[Scania N-series|Scania N230UDs]] entered service in 2007.\n\nThe most common single deck type is the [[Plaxton Pointer|Pointer]]-bodied [[Dennis Dart|Alexander Dennis/Dennis/TransBus Dart SLF]], with 72 vehicles of three different lengths in the fleet. The second most common type is the [[Scania OmniCity]], with 43 in total. Nineteen of the OmniCitys are the articulated variant.\n\nThe [[Alexander Dennis Enviro200]] also dominates, with 40 examples in the fleet, including ten with the \"MMC\" body. The [[Mercedes-Benz Citaro]] has become the standard large single deck type in recent years, with 40 Citaros in service as of August 2017. Operated in smaller numbers are the [[Alexander Dennis Enviro300|TransBus Enviro300]], with twelve examples, and seven [[Wright Solar]] bodied [[Scania K-series|Scania K230UBs]].\n\n===Branding===\nAlthough the predominant colour of Cardiff is blue, the original branding in both the entire tram, trolley bus and early bus operations until the 1970s was [[Carmine|crimson lake]] and cream livery. This then changed to orange with white lining, from August 1972 with \"City of Cardiff\" on the left hand side and \"Dinas Caerdydd\" on the right hand side. This changed in 1986 when the business became Cardiff Bus. However, since the 1990s the dominant colouring has been green, first with cream lining and since the introduction of modern wrapping, a return for orange in the adjustments/outline.\n\nJust before the introduction of the Iff Card, the company started a \"your bus service\" campaign, fronted by a series of local people's faces being applied in large scale on the sides and rears of selected buses.\n\nBus 472 had a grey vinyl wrapped livery advertising the IFF card following its launch in 2008. It was then repainted into a heritage orange and white livery to celebrate 30 years since the formation of Cardiff Bus (after the 1986 deregulation of buses) and it currently sports a vinyl wrap celebrating Cardiff's sporting success with Cardiff City Football Club, Cardiff Blues, Cardiff Devils ice hockey team and Gerraint Thomas winning the Tour De France.\n\n==Controversy==\nCardiff Bus's dominant position has sometimes come in for criticism and investigation. In 2004, 2Travel,<ref>[http://data.companieshouse.gov.uk/doc/company/03823139 Companies House extract company no 3823139] 2 Travel Group plc</ref> a company operating significant numbers of school contract services in South Wales, launched low-cost services in Cardiff and Swansea to utilise its fleet between the school runs. Low fares were achieved by omitting major bus stations avoiding hefty access fees.

It had been previously run by the [[Cardiff Tramway Company]]. The resultant [[Cardiff Corporation Tramways]] spent the next three decades extending its electric tram network, and at its peak in 1927 ran 141 electric trams over 18 miles of line. On Christmas Eve 1920, the corporation introduced its first bus, although the first motor bus route was operated by the Tramway Company from 1907.<ref name=History>[http://www.cardiffbus.com/english/page.shtml?pageid=361#_subnav04 The Cardiff Story], Cardiff Bus. Retrieved 19 October 2017.</ref>\n\nThe first [[Trolleybuses in Cardiff|Cardiff trolleybuses]] were introduced in 1942, their introduction having been delayed by the outbreak of [[World War II]]. The intention was to convert the remaining tramway system to trolleybus operation, then to extend the network. While the first stage was completed in 1950, the only extension made to the system was to [[Ely, Cardiff|Ely]] which took place in 1955. Although powers had been obtained to considerably expand the network, a policy U-turn occurred in 1961 when the decision was made to replace all the trolleybuses with motor buses. This task was completed in 1970, bringing to an end 68 years of electric traction on the streets of Cardiff.<ref name=History/>\n\nThe [[Transport Act 1985|Transport Act of 1985]] [[bus deregulation|deregulated bus services]] outside London and required all Local Authorities to establish private \"arm's length\" bus companies. In October 1986 the council established a subsidiary company.<ref name=company2001229>[http://data.companieshouse.gov.uk/doc/company/02001229 Companies House extract company no 2001229] Cardiff City Transport Services Limited</ref> In 1992, the closure of the National Welsh bus company led Cardiff Bus to extend and intensify its network in the areas and towns surrounding Cardiff, including [[Barry, Wales|Barry]], the [[Vale of Glamorgan]] and [[Caerphilly]]. The Caerphilly local network of services including links between Cardiff, Caerphilly, [[Blackwood, Caerphilly|Blackwood]] and [[Tredegar]] were discontinued in 2001 and are now provided by [[Stagecoach Wales|Stagecoach in South Wales]].\n\nSome loss-making services have been withdrawn and are now operated under local authority tender by other operators, including Watts Coaches and [[NAT Group]].\n\nFrom September 2016, four of Cardiff Bus' services (routes 51/53, 86 and X91) were transferred to its new Capital Links sister brand,<ref>{{cite web|title=Capital Links|url=http://www.cardiffbus.com/english/article.shtml?articleid=6016|website=Cardiff Bus|publisher=Cardiff Bus|accessdate=23 July 2017}}{{Dead link|date=April 2019 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref> with a further four services transferring over to Capital Links two months later.<ref>{{cite web|title=New Routes for Capital Links|url=http://www.capitallinks.co.uk/article.shtml?articleid=6215|website=Capital Links|publisher=Capital Links|accessdate=23 July 2017}}{{Dead link|date=April 2019 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref> Vehicles used on these services are in either an orange or green base livery, and as of July 2017, Capital Links operate seven routes.\n\n==Operations==\nCardiff Bus has a turnover of \u00a327million, employs around 705 people, on an average weekday carries around 100,000 passengers.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wtuclearn.org.uk/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=86&Itemid=49|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150610221345/http://www.wtuclearn.org.uk/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=86&Itemid=49|url-status=dead|archive-date=10 June 2015|title=Staff turnover plummets to record low levels|publisher=TUC Wales|accessdate=2 November 2008}}</ref> In 2009 the company started to operate the park and ride service from Cardiff City Stadium to the city centre.\n\n===Fares===\nCardiff Bus operates an exact fare policy and no change is given. The city used to be divided into four fare zones, but on 5 April 2009, Cardiff Bus introduced a flat fare of \u00a31.60 for a one-way journey or \u00a33.20 for all-day travel in Cardiff and Penarth, or \u00a31.40/\u00a32.80 for travel within Barry. This has since been increased to \u00a32.00 for a one-way journey or \u00a34.00 for all-day travel in Cardiff and Penarth, or \u00a31.90 and \u00a33.80 in Barry (\u00a33.20/\u00a35.50 Cardiff and Barry). A weekly ticket can be purchased for travel within Cardiff for \u00a315, but an \"iff card\" will need to be presented as this type of ticket is not printed out on their machine. Tickets can also be purchased on the mobile app (available for iOS and Android).\nSpecial fares apply for travel between Cardiff and Barry.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cardiffbus.com/english/faresandtickets.shtml#_subnav02|title=Our Fares|publisher=Cardiff Bus|accessdate=20 October 2017}}</ref> Special fares also apply for Newport, with a \u00a34.50 return ticket offered along with the Day to Go Plus ticket also being accepted.\n\n===Iff card===\n{{main|Iff card}}\n\nIff card is a [[contactless smart card]] introduced by Cardiff Bus in October 2010, allowing customers to travel on its services after having pre-paid. The first 30,000 cards were issued free of charge and preloaded with \u00a33 of credit, after which the cards will be charged at \u00a35.\n\nAn amount of money is electronically loaded onto the card, either upon boarding a bus or at the Cardiff Bus customer service centre. A passenger then chooses a ticket type. The card can also be used as a season ticket. The card should be topped-up when the balance is low, however, the card allows the customer to acquire a negative balance up to \u00a33.<ref>[http://www.cardiffbus.com/smartcard.shtml Smartcard] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101007204320/http://www.cardiffbus.com/smartcard.shtml |date=7 October 2010 }} Cardiff Bus</ref>\n\nThe card can be topped-up in units of \u00a31, \u00a32, \u00a33, \u00a34, \u00a35, \u00a310, \u00a315 or \u00a320, up to maximum amount of \u00a350. The card may be used by persons aged between 6 and 60. The Iff card cannot be used to pay a partial amount. The card is cancelled if not used for a continuous period of one year.<ref>[http://www.cardiffbus.com/terms_conditions.htm Iff: Terms and Conditions] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101010044719/http://www.cardiffbus.com/terms_conditions.htm |date=10 October 2010 }} Cardiff Bus</ref>\n\n=== Contactless ===\nIn March 2018 the company introduced the [[Ticketer]] contactless card payment system on all its routes.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.walesonline.co.uk/news/wales-news/cardiff-bus-introducing-contactless-payments-14385816|title=Cardiff Bus is introducing contactless payments this month|last=Hughes|first=Marcus|date=2018-03-08|website=walesonline|access-date=2020-03-15}}</ref> As well as including an [[EFTPOS]] reader for Visa/Mastercard cards, fares can be bought and scanned using the Cardiff Bus app (which on most tickets including day to go and week to go tickets is cheaper than using cash).<ref name=\":0\" /> The reader can also scan [[QR code|QR codes]] from paper multi-journey tickets.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n===Fleet===\n[[File:Park Place, Cathays, Cardiff (23714174510).jpg|thumb|right|A Mercedes-Benz Citaro and an Alexander Dennis Enviro400 in [[Cathays]]]]\nAs of August 2018, the fleet consists of 224 vehicles, all of which are low floor. Single deck vehicles dominate the fleet, accounting for 90.7% of the overall fleet. Since 2013, 90 brand new vehicles have been purchased, with the most recent being delivered in August 2017.\n\nOn the double deck side of the fleet, of which there are 23 vehicles, ten high capacity [[Alexander Dennis Enviro400]]s joined the fleet in 2015. Prior to the delivery of the former, thirteen [[East Lancs Olympus]] bodied [[Scania N-series|Scania N230UDs]] entered service in 2007.\n\nThe most common single deck type is the [[Plaxton Pointer|Pointer]]-bodied [[Dennis Dart|Alexander Dennis/Dennis/TransBus Dart SLF]], with 72 vehicles of three different lengths in the fleet. The second most common type is the [[Scania OmniCity]], with 43 in total. Nineteen of the OmniCitys are the articulated variant.\n\nThe [[Alexander Dennis Enviro200]] also dominates, with 40 examples in the fleet, including ten with the \"MMC\" body. The [[Mercedes-Benz Citaro]] has become the standard large single deck type in recent years, with 40 Citaros in service as of August 2017. Operated in smaller numbers are the [[Alexander Dennis Enviro300|TransBus Enviro300]], with twelve examples, and seven [[Wright Solar]] bodied [[Scania K-series|Scania K230UBs]].\n\n===Branding===\nAlthough the predominant colour of Cardiff is blue, the original branding in both the entire tram, trolley bus and early bus operations until the 1970s was [[Carmine|crimson lake]] and cream livery. This then changed to orange with white lining, from August 1972 with \"City of Cardiff\" on the left hand side and \"Dinas Caerdydd\" on the right hand side. This changed in 1986 when the business became Cardiff Bus. However, since the 1990s the dominant colouring has been green, first with cream lining and since the introduction of modern wrapping, a return for orange in the adjustments/outline.\n\nJust before the introduction of the Iff Card, the company started a \"your bus service\" campaign, fronted by a series of local people's faces being applied in large scale on the sides and rears of selected buses.\n\nBus 472 had a grey vinyl wrapped livery advertising the IFF card following its launch in 2008. It was then repainted into a heritage orange and white livery to celebrate 30 years since the formation of Cardiff Bus (after the 1986 deregulation of buses) and it currently sports a vinyl wrap celebrating Cardiff's sporting success with Cardiff City Football Club, Cardiff Blues, Cardiff Devils ice hockey team and Gerraint Thomas winning the Tour De France.\n\n==Controversy==\nCardiff Bus's dominant position has sometimes come in for criticism and investigation. In 2004, 2Travel,<ref>[http://data.companieshouse.gov.uk/doc/company/03823139 Companies House extract company no 3823139] 2 Travel Group plc</ref> a company operating significant numbers of school contract services in South Wales, launched low-cost services in Cardiff and Swansea to utilise its fleet between the school runs. Low fares were achieved by omitting major bus stations avoiding hefty access fees. Cardiff Bus launched a basic service in competition with 2Travel, using white buses bearing no livery also stopping short of the bus station. The [[Office of Fair Trading]] launched an investigation in 2007 into claims of predatory behaviour 18 months after 2Travel had ceased trading and gone into liquidation.<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/wales/south_east/6657685.stm Bus firm predatory tactics claim] ''BBC News'' 15 May 2007</ref><ref>[http://icwales.icnetwork.co.uk/0300business/0100news/tm_headline=oft-under-fire-for-delays-in-cardiff-bus-case&method=full&objectid=19109312&siteid=50082-name_page.html OFT under fire for delays in Cardiff Bus case] ''Western Mail'' 16 May 2007</ref> The investigation found that Cardiff Bus had engaged in predatory behaviour.<ref>[http://www.oft.gov.uk/OFTwork/competition-act-and-cartels/ca98/decisions/cardiffbus#.UlfmXVDI1PI Cardiff Bus] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130816105639/http://oft.gov.uk/OFTwork/competition-act-and-cartels/ca98/decisions/cardiffbus#.UlfmXVDI1PI |date=16 August 2013 }} Office of Fair Trading 2008</ref>\n\n==Gallery==\n===Branding===\nDifferent branding worn by Cardiff Bus vehicles.\n\n<gallery>\nFile:Metrider bus, Cardiff Bus.jpg|A ''MetRider'' branded TransBus Dart SLF in Cardiff City Centre\nFile:Baycar bus, Cardiff.jpg|A ''baycar'' branded Scania OmniCity\n</gallery>\n\n===Livery chronology===\nThe different liveries used by Cardiff Bus to the present day.\n\n<gallery>\nFile:Cardiff Corporation's Leyland PD3A1 404 CKG.jpg|A Leyland PD3A1 in the crimson and cream livery used until 1972\nFile:Cardiff Bus Station - geograph.org.uk - 1528163.jpg|A Bristol LH in the orange livery used from 1972 until the 1980s\nFile:143a.JPG|An Optare MetroRider in the ''Clipper'' livery used from 1987\nFile:Easyrider - Cardiff Bus.jpg|A Dennis Dart in the ''EasyRider'' livery used from 1987 to 1999\nFile:Cardiff Bus to Barry Island - geograph.org.uk - 1783959.jpg|A Dennis Dart in the blue and cream livery used from 1999 until 2007\nFile:Cardiff Bus double decker (Central Bus Station).jpg|An Optare Olympus in the current livery used since 2007\n</gallery>\n\n==See also==\n* [[Bus transport in Cardiff]]\n* [[List of bus operators of the United Kingdom]]\n* [[Municipal bus companies]]\n* [[Transport in Wales]]\n* [[Transport in Cardiff]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|2}}\n\n== External links ==\n{{commons category}}\n* {{Official website}}\n* [http://www.cardiffbus.com/pdfs/network%20map.
