{"title_page": "Klaus Mertens (artist)", "text_new": "{{Multiple issues|\n{{BLP sources|date=March 2020}}\n{{Copy edit|date=March 2020}}\n}}\n'''Klaus Mertens''' (born 1950 in [[Bonn]]) is a German contemporary artist, currently living in [[Berlin]], Germany, [[Addis Ababa]] capital of Ethiopia.\n\n==Life and art==\nIn the 1970s, Klaus Mertens first studied architecture. After some years on the job he started his studies of fine arts in 1984 at [[Berlin University of the Arts|UDK]] Berlin. In 1991, he graduated with his master in the class of [[Georg Baselitz]]. For many years he lived and worked in Berlin as an artist. \n\nHaving been attracted by [[Culture of Africa|African culture]] and art, he traveled to Ethiopia for the first time in 2007. Mertens stayed in Addis Ababa to work, and lives there to this day. He started teaching at the Addis Ababa University, Ale School of Fine Arts and Design (ASFAD), in 2010, where he founded a new class for [[lithography]]. \n\nIn 2013, he established a partnership between the Ale School of fine Arts and Design and the Hochschule f\u00fcr Bildende K\u00fcnste in [[Dresden]], Germany. He now coordinates the exchange program between both academies.\n\nIn his early career, Klaus Mertens attributed to figurative art by a series of large woodcuts he called \u201cWoodcut Tattoos\u201d. This work celebrated the human body; appearing as grand, austere images, playing with patterns, and giving the surface an occult and strong expression. \n\nHis handy \u201cSocial Prints\u201d are graphics showing poetic, sensitive images like landscapes and portraits combining elements of pop art and traditional woodcarving. When he moved to Ethiopia, Mertens artwork expanded to sculpturing, photography and design. There, he transferred his kind of work with ornaments and patterns \u2013 known for his woodcut prints \u2013 into the third dimension. Using materials of a lower aesthetic value like plastic bags, branches, bones or animal skulls, he created emblematic pieces of art like the ''Fashion Racks'' (2008), ''Jungle Fighter'' (2009), ''Knitted Egg'' (2014), ''True to Nature'' (2015), ''Global Suit'' (2015), ''Hypoxylon Addis'' (2015). \n\nIt was for this reason that one of his exhibitions in Addis Ababa, at the Asni Gallery in 2012, was called: ''Big Pretenders, Trophies and a Drunken Donkey''. Mertens\u2018 work reflects the human behavior of wasting nature or hunting for trophies practiced all over the African Continent. That this kind of power counts more than knowledge, spirit and science provokes Mertens\u2018 reflections in his art. Deconstructing perceptions, materials and meanings are part of his work. \n\nSince 2010, Klaus Mertens has created sculptures that can be used as furniture as well. Working with this kind of design, Mertens can be seen in the tradition of artists like [[Richard Artschwager]] or Ron Aaron. His stool design received a prize in [[Vienna]] in 2010 by Habari and branded ato klaus. The stool is now distributed worldwide. Other \"furniture objects\u201c are the ''ato goethe'' collection constructed from recycled floor wood of the German institution in Addis. Also, he has created what are called ''ato goma'', objects shaped from woven rubber stripes of car tires.\n\n==Selected exhibitions==\nSolo shows:\n* 2016 Lela Gallery, Addis Ababa\n* 2015 Alliance Ethio Francaise, Addis Ababa\n* 2012 Asni Gallery,  Addis Ababa\n* 2011 Alliance Ethio Francaise, Addis Ababa\n* 2010 German House, Addis Abeba\n* 2009 Commerzbank Representative Office, Addis Abeba\n* 2008 Showroom, Addis Ababa.
