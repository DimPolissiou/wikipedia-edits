Its neighbours are the [[Democratic Republic of the Congo]] to the north, [[Tanzania]] to the north-east, [[Malawi]] to the east, [[Mozambique]] to the southeast, [[Zimbabwe]] and [[Botswana]] to the south, [[Namibia]] to the southwest, and [[Angola]] to the west. The capital city is [[Lusaka]], located in the south-central part of Zambia. The population is concentrated mainly around Lusaka in the south and the [[Copperbelt Province]] to the northwest, the core economic hubs of the country.\n\nOriginally inhabited by [[Khoisan]] peoples, the region was affected by the [[Bantu expansion]] of the thirteenth century. Following [[European exploration of Africa|European explorers]] in the eighteenth century, the British colonised the region into the British protectorates of [[Barotziland-North-Western Rhodesia]] and [[North-Eastern Rhodesia]] towards the end of the nineteenth century. These were merged in 1911 to form [[Northern Rhodesia]]. For most of the colonial period, Zambia was governed by an administration appointed from London with the advice of the [[British South Africa Company]].\n\nOn 24 October 1964, Zambia became independent of the United Kingdom and prime minister [[Kenneth Kaunda]] became the inaugural president. Kaunda's socialist [[United National Independence Party]] (UNIP) maintained power from 1964 until 1991. Kaunda played a key role in regional diplomacy, cooperating closely with the United States in search of solutions to conflicts in Rhodesia (Zimbabwe), Angola, and Namibia.<ref>Andy DeRoche, ''Kenneth Kaunda, the United States and Southern Africa'' (London: Bloomsbury, 2016).</ref> From 1972 to 1991 Zambia was a [[one-party state]] with the UNIP as the sole legal political party under the motto \"One Zambia, One Nation\". Kaunda was succeeded by [[Frederick Chiluba]] of the social-democratic [[Movement for Multi-Party Democracy]] in 1991, beginning a period of social-economic growth and government decentralisation. [[Levy Mwanawasa]], Chiluba's chosen successor, presided over Zambia from January 2002 until his death in August 2008, and is credited with campaigns to reduce corruption and increase the standard of living. After Mwanawasa's death, [[Rupiah Banda]] presided as Acting President before being elected President in 2008. Holding office for only three years, Banda stepped down after his defeat in the [[Zambian general election, 2011|2011 elections]] by [[Patriotic Front (Zambia)|Patriotic Front]] party leader [[Michael Sata]]. Sata died on 28 October 2014, making him the second Zambian president to die in office.<ref>[https://www.bbc.com/news/world-africa-29813612 Zambian President Michael Sata dies in London&nbsp;\u2013 BBC News].

The most prominent of these was [[David Livingstone]], who had a vision of ending the [[History of slavery|slave trade]] through the \"3 Cs\": Christianity, Commerce and Civilisation. He was the first European to see the magnificent waterfalls on the [[Zambezi River]] in 1855, naming them the [[Victoria Falls]] after [[Queen Victoria]] of the United Kingdom.

In Zambia's situation, the cost of transporting the copper great distances to market was an additional strain. Zambia turned to foreign and international lenders for relief, but, as copper prices remained depressed, it became increasingly difficult to service its growing debt. By the mid-1990s, despite limited debt relief, Zambia's per capita foreign debt remained among the highest in the world.\n\n===Democratisation===\n\nIn June 1990 riots against Kaunda accelerated. Many protesters were killed by the regime in breakthrough June 1990 protests. In 1990 Kaunda survived an [[1990 Zambian coup d'\u00e9tat attempt|attempted coup]], and in 1991 he agreed to reinstate multiparty democracy, having instituted one-party rule under the Choma Commission of 1972. Following multiparty elections, Kaunda was removed from office (see below).\n\nIn the 2000s, the economy stabilised, attaining single-digit inflation in 2006\u20132007, real GDP growth, decreasing interest rates, and increasing levels of trade. Much of its growth is due to foreign investment in mining and to higher world copper prices. All this led to Zambia being courted enthusiastically by aid donors, and saw a surge in investor confidence in the country.\n\n==Politics==\n{{Main|Politics of Zambia}}\n\n[[File:Zambia National Assembly Building.jpg|thumb|Zambia National Assembly building in [[Lusaka]]]]\n\nPolitics in Zambia take place in a framework of a [[presidential system|presidential]] [[representative democracy|representative democratic]] republic, whereby the [[List of Presidents of Zambia|President of Zambia]] is both [[head of state]] and [[head of government]] in a pluriform [[multi-party system]].

At {{convert|752614|km2|sqmi|0|abbr=on}} it is the 39th-largest country in the world, slightly smaller than [[Chile]]. The country lies mostly between latitudes [[8th parallel south|8\u00b0]] and [[18th parallel south|18\u00b0S]], and longitudes [[22nd meridian east|22\u00b0]] and [[34th meridian east|34\u00b0E]].\n\nZambia is drained by two major river basins: the [[Zambezi River|Zambezi]]/Kafue basin in the centre, west and south covering about three-quarters of the country; and the [[Congo River|Congo]] basin in the north covering about one-quarter of the country. A very small area in the northeast forms part of the internal drainage basin of [[Lake Rukwa]] in Tanzania.\n\nIn the Zambezi basin, there are a number of major rivers flowing wholly or partially through Zambia: the [[Kabompo River|Kabompo]], [[Lungwebungu River|Lungwebungu]], [[Kafue River|Kafue]], [[Luangwa River|Luangwa]], and the Zambezi itself, which flows through the country in the west and then forms its southern border with [[Namibia]], Botswana and [[Zimbabwe]]. Its source is in Zambia but it diverts into Angola, and a number of its tributaries rise in Angola's central highlands. The edge of the [[Cuando River]] floodplain (not its main channel) forms Zambia's southwestern border, and via the [[Chobe River]] that river contributes very little water to the Zambezi because most is lost by evaporation.<ref name=\"Beilfuss\">Beilfuss, Richard and dos Santos, David (2001)  [http://files.gorongosa.net/filestore/348-patterns_hydrological_change_zambezi_delta.pdf \"Patterns of Hydrological Change in the Zambezi Delta, Mozambique\".] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081217180850/http://files.gorongosa.net/filestore/348-patterns_hydrological_change_zambezi_delta.pdf |date=17 December 2008 }} Working Paper No 2 Program for the Sustainable Management of Cahora Bassa Dam and The Lower Zambezi Valley.</ref>\n\nTwo of the Zambezi's longest and largest tributaries, the Kafue and the Luangwa, flow mainly in Zambia. Their confluences with the Zambezi are on the border with Zimbabwe at Chirundu and [[Luangwa, Zambia|Luangwa town]] respectively. Before its confluence, the Luangwa River forms part of Zambia's border with [[Mozambique]]. From Luangwa town, the Zambezi leaves Zambia and flows into Mozambique, and eventually into the [[Mozambique Channel]].\n\nThe Zambezi falls about {{convert|100|m|ft|0}} over the {{convert|1.6|km|mi|abbr=on}} wide [[Victoria Falls]], located in the south-west corner of the country, subsequently flowing into [[Lake Kariba]]. The Zambezi valley, running along the southern border, is both deep and wide. From Lake Kariba going east it is formed by [[graben]]s and like the Luangwa, Mweru-Luapula, [[Mweru-wa-Ntipa]] and Lake Tanganyika valleys, is a [[rift valley]].\n\nThe north of Zambia is very flat with broad plains. In the west the most notable being the [[Barotse Floodplain]] on the Zambezi, which floods from December to June, lagging behind the annual rainy season (typically November to April). The [[floodplain|flood]] dominates the natural environment and the lives, society and culture of the inhabitants and those of other smaller, floodplains throughout the country.\n\n[[File:Cataratas Victoria, Zambia-Zimbabue, 2018-07-27, DD 05.jpg|thumb|[[Victoria Falls]]]]\nIn Eastern Zambia the plateau which extends between the Zambezi and Lake Tanganyika valleys is tilted upwards to the north, and so rises imperceptibly from about {{convert|900|m|ft|0|abbr=on}} in the south to {{convert|1200|m|ft|0|abbr=on}} in the centre, reaching {{convert|1800|m|ft|0|abbr=on}} in the north near Mbala.

The border of the [[Congo Pedicle]] was drawn around this mountain.\n\nThe southernmost headstream of the Congo River rises in Zambia and flows west through its northern area firstly as the [[Chambeshi River|Chambeshi]] and then, after the [[Lake Bangweulu|Bangweulu Swamps]] as the [[Luapula River|Luapula]], which forms part of the border with the [[Democratic Republic of the Congo]]. The Luapula flows south then west before it turns north until it enters [[Lake Mweru]]. The lake's other major tributary is the [[Kalungwishi River]], which flows into it from the east. The [[Luvua River]] drains Lake Mweru, flowing out of the northern end to the [[Lualaba River]] (Upper Congo River).\n\n[[Lake Tanganyika]] is the other major [[hydrography|hydrographic]] feature that belongs to the Congo basin. Its south-eastern end receives water from the [[Kalambo River]], which forms part of Zambia's border with Tanzania. This river has Africa's second highest uninterrupted waterfall, the [[Kalambo Falls]].\n\n===Climate===\n{{Main|Climate of Zambia}}\nZambia is located on the plateau of [[Central Africa]], between 1000 and 1600 m above sea level. The average altitude of {{convert|1200|m}} generally has a moderate climate. The climate of Zambia is tropical, modified by elevation.

The dry season is subdivided into the cool dry season (May/June to August), and the hot dry season (September to October/November). The modifying influence of altitude gives the country pleasant [[subtropical]] weather rather than tropical conditions during the cool season of May to August.<ref>''Spectrum Guide to Zambia''.

The total number of languages spoken in Zambia is 73.\n\n{{Dominant regional languages in Zambia}}\nUrbanisation has had a dramatic effect on some of the indigenous languages, including the assimilation of words from other languages. Urban dwellers sometimes differentiate between urban and rural dialects of the same language by prefixing the rural languages with 'deep'.\n\nMost will thus speak Bemba and Nyanja in the Copperbelt; Nyanja is dominantly spoken in Lusaka and Eastern Zambia. English is used in official communications and is the language of choice at home among&nbsp;\u2013 now common&nbsp;\u2013 intertribal families.

One of the results of the colonial era was the growth of urbanisation. Different ethnic groups started living together in towns and cities, influencing each other as well as adopting a lot of the [[European culture]]. The original cultures have largely survived in the rural areas with some outside influence such as Christianity being widely practiced. In the urban setting there is a continuous integration and evolution of these cultures to produce what is now called \"Zambian culture\".\n\n[[File:African Art, Yombe sculpture, Louvre.jpg|thumb|left|upright|A [[Yombe people|Yombe]] sculpture, 19th century.]]\nTraditional culture is very visible through colourful annual [[Zambian traditional ceremonies]]. Some of the more prominent are: [[Kuomboka]] and [[Kathanga]] (Western Province), [[Kazembe#Mutomboko Festival|Mutomboko]] (Luapula Province), [[Kulamba ceremony|Kulamba]] and [[Ncwala]] (Eastern Province), [[Lwiindi]] and [[Shimunenga]] (Southern Province), [[Lunda Lubanza]] (North Western), [[Likumbi Lyamize]] (North Western), [[Mbunda Lukwakwa]] (North Western Province), [[Chibwela Kumushi]] (Central Province), [[Vinkhakanimba]] (Muchinga Province), [[Ukusefya Pa Ng'wena]] (Northern Province).\n\nPopular traditional arts are mainly in pottery, basketry (such as [[Tonga baskets]]), stools, fabrics, mats, wooden carvings, ivory carvings, wire craft and copper crafts. Most [[Music of Zambia|Zambian traditional music]] is based on drums (and other percussion instruments) with a lot of singing and dancing. In the urban areas foreign genres of music are popular, in particular Congolese [[Soukous|rumba]], African-American music and Jamaican reggae. Several psychedelic rock artists emerged in the 1970s to create a genre known as [[Zam-rock]], including WITCH, Musi-O-Tunya, Rikki Ililonga, Amanaz, the Peace, Chrissy Zebby Tembo, Blackfoot, and the Ngozi Family.\n\n===Media===\n{{Main|Media in Zambia|Telecommunications in Zambia}}\nThe [https://web.archive.org/web/20130919070712/http://www.statehouse.gov.zm/en/ministry-of-information-and-broadcasting-services-p-o-box-50200-lusaka-zambia-tel-260-211-235410/ Ministry of Information, Broadcasting Services and Tourism In Zambia] is responsible for the [[Zambian News Agency]], while there are also numerous media outlets throughout the country which include; [[television station]]s, [[newspaper]]s, [[FM broadcasting|FM radio stations]], and [[Online journalism|Internet news websites]].\n\n===Sports===\n{{Main|Sport in Zambia}}\nZambia declared its independence on the day of the closing ceremony of the [[1964 Summer Olympics]], thereby becoming the first country ever to have entered an Olympic games as one country, and left it as another. In 2016, Zambia participated for the thirteenth time in the Olympic games. Two medals were won. The medals were won successively in boxing and in track. In 1984 Keith Mwila won the bronze medal in the light flyweights. In 1996 Samuel Matete won the silver medal in the 400 meter hurdles. Zambia has never participated in the Winter olympics.\n\n[[Association football|Football]] is the most popular sport in Zambia, and the [[Zambia national football team]] has had its triumphant moments in football history. At the [[Seoul Olympics]] of 1988, the national team defeated the [[Italy national football team|Italian national team]] by a score of 4\u20130. [[Kalusha Bwalya]], Zambia's most celebrated football player and one of Africa's greatest football players in history had a hat trick in that match. However, to this day, many pundits say the greatest team Zambia has ever assembled was the one that perished on 28 April 1993 in a [[1993 Zambia national football team air disaster|plane crash]] at [[Libreville, Gabon]]. Despite this, in 1996, Zambia was ranked 15th on the official FIFA World Football Team rankings, the highest attained by any southern African team. In 2012, Zambia won the [[African Cup of Nations]] for the first time after losing in the final twice. They beat C\u00f4te d'Ivoire 8\u20137 in a penalty shoot-out in the final, which was played in Libreville, just a few kilometres away from the plane crash 19 years previously.<ref name=\"Africa Cup\">{{cite news|url=http://news.smh.com.au/breaking-news-sport/zambia-score-emotional-african-cup-win-20120213-1t0fb.html|title=Zambia score emotional African Cup win |work=Sydney Morning Herald |accessdate=11 February 2012|date=13 February 2012}}</ref>\n\n[[Rugby Union]], [[boxing]] and [[cricket]] are also popular sports in Zambia.

The capital city is [[Lusaka]], located in the south-central part of Zambia. The population is concentrated mainly around Lusaka in the south and the [[Copperbelt Province]] to the northwest, the core economic hubs of the country.\n\nOriginally inhabited by [[Khoisan]] peoples, the region was affected by the [[Bantu expansion]] of the thirteenth century. Following [[European exploration of Africa|European explorers]] in the eighteenth century, the British colonised the region into the British protectorates of [[Barotziland-North-Western Rhodesia]] and [[North-Eastern Rhodesia]] towards the end of the nineteenth century. These were merged in 1911 to form [[Northern Rhodesia]]. For most of the colonial period, Zambia was governed by an administration appointed from London with the advice of the [[British South Africa Company]].\n\nOn 24 October 1964, Zambia became independent of the United Kingdom and prime minister [[Kenneth Kaunda]] became the inaugural president. Kaunda's socialist [[United National Independence Party]] (UNIP) maintained power from 1964 until 1991. Kaunda played a key role in regional diplomacy, cooperating closely with the United States in search of solutions to conflicts in Rhodesia (Zimbabwe), Angola, and Namibia.<ref>Andy DeRoche, ''Kenneth Kaunda, the United States and Southern Africa'' (London: Bloomsbury, 2016).</ref> From 1972 to 1991 Zambia was a [[one-party state]] with the UNIP as the sole legal political party under the motto \"One Zambia, One Nation\". Kaunda was succeeded by [[Frederick Chiluba]] of the social-democratic [[Movement for Multi-Party Democracy]] in 1991, beginning a period of social-economic growth and government decentralisation. [[Levy Mwanawasa]], Chiluba's chosen successor, presided over Zambia from January 2002 until his death in August 2008, and is credited with campaigns to reduce corruption and increase the standard of living. After Mwanawasa's death, [[Rupiah Banda]] presided as Acting President before being elected President in 2008. Holding office for only three years, Banda stepped down after his defeat in the [[Zambian general election, 2011|2011 elections]] by [[Patriotic Front (Zambia)|Patriotic Front]] party leader [[Michael Sata]].

The most prominent of these was [[David Livingstone]], who had a vision of ending the [[History of slavery|slave trade]] through the \"3 Cs\": Christianity, Commerce and Civilisation. He was the first European to see the magnificent waterfalls on the [[Zambezi River]] in 1855, naming them the [[Victoria Falls]] after [[Queen Victoria]] of the United Kingdom. He described them thus: \"Scenes so lovely must have been gazed upon by angels in their flight\".\n\nLocally the falls are known as \"Mosi-o-Tunya\" or \"thundering smoke\" in the Lozi or Kololo dialect. The town of [[Livingstone, Zambia|Livingstone]], near the Falls, is named after him. Highly publicised accounts of his journeys motivated a wave of European visitors, missionaries and traders after his death in 1873.<ref>\"First to the Falls\" by Gervas and Gill Clay</ref>{{unreliable source?|date=October 2014}}\n\n===British South Africa Company===\nIn 1888, the [[British South Africa Company]] (BSA Company), led by [[Cecil Rhodes]], obtained mineral rights from the [[Litunga]] of the Lozi people, the Paramount Chief of the [[Lozi people|Lozi (Ba-rotse)]] for the area which later became [[Barotziland-North-Western Rhodesia]].<ref name=\"livingstone\">{{cite web\n| title=Destination:Zambia&nbsp;\u2013 History and Culture\n| url=http://www.livingstonetourism.com/pages/history.htm\n| author=Livingstone Tourism Association | accessdate=29 October 2007\n| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20071012153527/http://livingstonetourism.com/pages/history.htm |archivedate = 12 October 2007}}</ref>\n\n[[File:CecilRhodes.jpg|thumb|upright|left|Cecil Rhodes]]\nTo the east, in December 1897 a group of the [[Ngoni people|Angoni or Ngoni]] (originally from Zululand) rebelled under Tsinco, son of King [[Mpezeni]], but the rebellion was put down,<ref name=\"unam\">{{cite web\n| title=Zambia: Historical Background |author1=Human Rights  |author2=Documentation Centre  |lastauthoramp=yes | url=http://www.hrdc.unam.na/zm_history.htm\n| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20070311093653/http://www.hrdc.unam.na/zm_history.htm\n| archivedate=11 March 2007 | accessdate=14 January 2011\n}}</ref> and [[Mpezeni]] accepted the [[Pax Britannica]].

The council passed resolutions calling for Northern Rhodesia's secession from the federation and demanding full internal self-government under a new constitution and a new [[National Assembly of Zambia|National Assembly]] based on a broader, more democratic franchise.\n\nThe federation was dissolved on 31 December 1963, and in January 1964, Kaunda won the only election for Prime Minister of Northern Rhodesia. The [[Governor of Northern Rhodesia|Colonial Governor]], Sir [[Evelyn Dennison Hone|Evelyn Hone]], was very close to Kaunda and urged him to stand for the post. Soon after, there was an uprising in the north of the country known as the [[Lumpa Church|Lumpa Uprising]] led by [[Alice Lenshina]]&nbsp;\u2013 Kaunda's first internal conflict as leader of the nation.\n\nNorthern Rhodesia became the Republic of Zambia on 24 October 1964, with [[Kenneth Kaunda]] as the first president.

By the mid-1990s, despite limited debt relief, Zambia's per capita foreign debt remained among the highest in the world.\n\n===Democratisation===\n\nIn June 1990 riots against Kaunda accelerated. Many protesters were killed by the regime in breakthrough June 1990 protests. In 1990 Kaunda survived an [[1990 Zambian coup d'\u00e9tat attempt|attempted coup]], and in 1991 he agreed to reinstate multiparty democracy, having instituted one-party rule under the Choma Commission of 1972. Following multiparty elections, Kaunda was removed from office (see below).\n\nIn the 2000s, the economy stabilised, attaining single-digit inflation in 2006\u20132007, real GDP growth, decreasing interest rates, and increasing levels of trade. Much of its growth is due to foreign investment in mining and to higher world copper prices. All this led to Zambia being courted enthusiastically by aid donors, and saw a surge in investor confidence in the country.\n\n==Politics==\n{{Main|Politics of Zambia}}\n\n[[File:Zambia National Assembly Building.jpg|thumb|Zambia National Assembly building in [[Lusaka]]]]\n\nPolitics in Zambia take place in a framework of a [[presidential system|presidential]] [[representative democracy|representative democratic]] republic, whereby the [[List of Presidents of Zambia|President of Zambia]] is both [[head of state]] and [[head of government]] in a pluriform [[multi-party system]].

At {{convert|752614|km2|sqmi|0|abbr=on}} it is the 39th-largest country in the world, slightly smaller than [[Chile]]. The country lies mostly between latitudes [[8th parallel south|8\u00b0]] and [[18th parallel south|18\u00b0S]], and longitudes [[22nd meridian east|22\u00b0]] and [[34th meridian east|34\u00b0E]].\n\nZambia is drained by two major river basins: the [[Zambezi River|Zambezi]]/Kafue basin in the centre, west and south covering about three-quarters of the country; and the [[Congo River|Congo]] basin in the north covering about one-quarter of the country. A very small area in the northeast forms part of the internal drainage basin of [[Lake Rukwa]] in Tanzania.\n\nIn the Zambezi basin, there are a number of major rivers flowing wholly or partially through Zambia: the [[Kabompo River|Kabompo]], [[Lungwebungu River|Lungwebungu]], [[Kafue River|Kafue]], [[Luangwa River|Luangwa]], and the Zambezi itself, which flows through the country in the west and then forms its southern border with [[Namibia]], Botswana and [[Zimbabwe]]. Its source is in Zambia but it diverts into Angola, and a number of its tributaries rise in Angola's central highlands. The edge of the [[Cuando River]] floodplain (not its main channel) forms Zambia's southwestern border, and via the [[Chobe River]] that river contributes very little water to the Zambezi because most is lost by evaporation.<ref name=\"Beilfuss\">Beilfuss, Richard and dos Santos, David (2001)  [http://files.gorongosa.net/filestore/348-patterns_hydrological_change_zambezi_delta.pdf \"Patterns of Hydrological Change in the Zambezi Delta, Mozambique\".] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081217180850/http://files.gorongosa.net/filestore/348-patterns_hydrological_change_zambezi_delta.pdf |date=17 December 2008 }} Working Paper No 2 Program for the Sustainable Management of Cahora Bassa Dam and The Lower Zambezi Valley.</ref>\n\nTwo of the Zambezi's longest and largest tributaries, the Kafue and the Luangwa, flow mainly in Zambia. Their confluences with the Zambezi are on the border with Zimbabwe at Chirundu and [[Luangwa, Zambia|Luangwa town]] respectively. Before its confluence, the Luangwa River forms part of Zambia's border with [[Mozambique]]. From Luangwa town, the Zambezi leaves Zambia and flows into Mozambique, and eventually into the [[Mozambique Channel]].\n\nThe Zambezi falls about {{convert|100|m|ft|0}} over the {{convert|1.6|km|mi|abbr=on}} wide [[Victoria Falls]], located in the south-west corner of the country, subsequently flowing into [[Lake Kariba]]. The Zambezi valley, running along the southern border, is both deep and wide. From Lake Kariba going east it is formed by [[graben]]s and like the Luangwa, Mweru-Luapula, [[Mweru-wa-Ntipa]] and Lake Tanganyika valleys, is a [[rift valley]].\n\nThe north of Zambia is very flat with broad plains. In the west the most notable being the [[Barotse Floodplain]] on the Zambezi, which floods from December to June, lagging behind the annual rainy season (typically November to April). The [[floodplain|flood]] dominates the natural environment and the lives, society and culture of the inhabitants and those of other smaller, floodplains throughout the country.\n\n[[File:Cataratas Victoria, Zambia-Zimbabue, 2018-07-27, DD 05.jpg|thumb|[[Victoria Falls]]]]\nIn Eastern Zambia the plateau which extends between the Zambezi and Lake Tanganyika valleys is tilted upwards to the north, and so rises imperceptibly from about {{convert|900|m|ft|0|abbr=on}} in the south to {{convert|1200|m|ft|0|abbr=on}} in the centre, reaching {{convert|1800|m|ft|0|abbr=on}} in the north near Mbala. These plateau areas of northern Zambia have been categorised by the [[World Wildlife Fund]] as a large section of the [[Central Zambezian Miombo woodlands]] [[ecoregion]].\n\nEastern Zambia shows great diversity. The Luangwa Valley splits the plateau in a curve north-east to south-west, extended west into the heart of the plateau by the deep valley of the [[Lunsemfwa River]]. Hills and mountains are found by the side of some sections of the valley, notably in its north-east the Nyika Plateau ({{convert|2200|m|ft|0|abbr=on|disp=or}}) on the Malawi border, which extend into Zambia as the [[Mafinga Hills]], containing the country's highest point, [[Mafinga Central]] ({{convert|2339|m|ft|0|abbr=on|disp=or}}).<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.markhorrell.com/blog/2014/mafinga-south-and-mafinga-central-the-highest-peaks-in-zambia/ |title=Mafinga South and Mafinga Central: the highest peaks in Zambia |publisher=Footsteps on the Mountain blog |accessdate=16 October 2014 }}</ref>\n\nThe Muchinga Mountains, the watershed between the Zambezi and Congo drainage basins, run parallel to the deep valley of the Luangwa River and form a sharp backdrop to its northern edge, although they are almost everywhere below {{convert|1700|m|ft|0|abbr=on}}. Their culminating peak Mumpu is at the western end and at {{convert|1892|m|ft|0|abbr=on}} is the highest point in Zambia away from the eastern border region. The border of the [[Congo Pedicle]] was drawn around this mountain.\n\nThe southernmost headstream of the Congo River rises in Zambia and flows west through its northern area firstly as the [[Chambeshi River|Chambeshi]] and then, after the [[Lake Bangweulu|Bangweulu Swamps]] as the [[Luapula River|Luapula]], which forms part of the border with the [[Democratic Republic of the Congo]]. The Luapula flows south then west before it turns north until it enters [[Lake Mweru]]. The lake's other major tributary is the [[Kalungwishi River]], which flows into it from the east. The [[Luvua River]] drains Lake Mweru, flowing out of the northern end to the [[Lualaba River]] (Upper Congo River).\n\n[[Lake Tanganyika]] is the other major [[hydrography|hydrographic]] feature that belongs to the Congo basin. Its south-eastern end receives water from the [[Kalambo River]], which forms part of Zambia's border with Tanzania. This river has Africa's second highest uninterrupted waterfall, the [[Kalambo Falls]].\n\n===Climate===\n{{Main|Climate of Zambia}}\nZambia is located on the plateau of [[Central Africa]], between 1000 and 1600 m above sea level. The average altitude of {{convert|1200|m}} generally has a moderate climate. The climate of Zambia is tropical, modified by elevation. In the [[K\u00f6ppen climate classification]], most of the country is classified as [[humid subtropical]] or [[tropical wet and dry climate|tropical wet and dry]], with small stretches of semi-arid [[steppe climate]] in the south-west and along the [[Zambezi valley]].\n\nThere are two main seasons, the [[rainy season]] (November to April) corresponding to summer, and the [[dry season]] (May/June to October/November), corresponding to winter. The dry season is subdivided into the cool dry season (May/June to August), and the hot dry season (September to October/November). The modifying influence of altitude gives the country pleasant [[subtropical]] weather rather than tropical conditions during the cool season of May to August.<ref>''Spectrum Guide to Zambia''.

In the Copperbelt [[Bemba language|Bemba]] is the main language and [[Nyanja]] second. [[Bemba language|Bemba]] and [[Nyanja]] are spoken in the urban areas in addition to other indigenous languages which are commonly spoken in Zambia. These include [[Lozi language|Lozi]], [[Kaonde]], [[Tonga language (Zambia and Zimbabwe)|Tonga]], [[Lunda languages|Lunda]] and [[Luvale]], which feature on the [[Zambia National Broadcasting Corporation]] (ZNBC)'s local languages section. The total number of languages spoken in Zambia is 73.\n\n{{Dominant regional languages in Zambia}}\nUrbanisation has had a dramatic effect on some of the indigenous languages, including the assimilation of words from other languages. Urban dwellers sometimes differentiate between urban and rural dialects of the same language by prefixing the rural languages with 'deep'.\n\nMost will thus speak Bemba and Nyanja in the Copperbelt; Nyanja is dominantly spoken in Lusaka and Eastern Zambia. English is used in official communications and is the language of choice at home among&nbsp;\u2013 now common&nbsp;\u2013 intertribal families. This evolution of languages has led to [[Zambian slang]] heard throughout Lusaka and other major cities.

Initially, Zambia hoped to reach the HIPC completion point, and benefit from substantial debt forgiveness, in late 2003.\n\n[[File:GDP per capita (current), % of world average, 1960-2012; Zimbabwe, South Africa, Botswana, Zambia, Mozambique.png|thumb|GDP per capita (current), compared to neighbouring countries (world average = 100)]]\nIn January 2003, the Zambian government informed the International Monetary Fund and [[World Bank]] that it wished to renegotiate some of the agreed performance criteria calling for privatisation of the Zambia National Commercial Bank and the national telephone and electricity utilities. Although agreements were reached on these issues, subsequent overspending on civil service wages delayed Zambia's final HIPC debt forgiveness from late 2003 to early 2005, at the earliest. In an effort to reach HIPC completion in 2004, the government drafted an austerity budget for 2004, freezing civil service salaries and increasing a number of taxes. The tax hike and public sector wage freeze prohibited salary increases and new hires. This sparked a nationwide strike in February 2004.<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20090724213759/http://www.eurodad.org/whatsnew/articles.aspx?id=2108 The World Bank and IMF's long shadow in Zambia's copper mines]. eurodad.org. 20 February 2008</ref>\n\nThe Zambian government is pursuing an economic diversification program to reduce the economy's reliance on the copper industry.

Output of copper had fallen to a low of 228,000 metric tons in 1998 after a 30-year decline in output due to lack of investment, low copper prices, and uncertainty over privatisation. In 2002, following privatisation of the industry, copper production rebounded to 337,000 metric tons.

One of the results of the colonial era was the growth of urbanisation. Different ethnic groups started living together in towns and cities, influencing each other as well as adopting a lot of the [[European culture]]. The original cultures have largely survived in the rural areas with some outside influence such as Christianity being widely practiced. In the urban setting there is a continuous integration and evolution of these cultures to produce what is now called \"Zambian culture\".\n\n[[File:African Art, Yombe sculpture, Louvre.jpg|thumb|left|upright|A [[Yombe people|Yombe]] sculpture, 19th century.]]\nTraditional culture is very visible through colourful annual [[Zambian traditional ceremonies]].

Most [[Music of Zambia|Zambian traditional music]] is based on drums (and other percussion instruments) with a lot of singing and dancing. In the urban areas foreign genres of music are popular, in particular Congolese [[Soukous|rumba]], African-American music and Jamaican reggae. Several psychedelic rock artists emerged in the 1970s to create a genre known as [[Zam-rock]], including WITCH, Musi-O-Tunya, Rikki Ililonga, Amanaz, the Peace, Chrissy Zebby Tembo, Blackfoot, and the Ngozi Family.\n\n===Media===\n{{Main|Media in Zambia|Telecommunications in Zambia}}\nThe [https://web.archive.org/web/20130919070712/http://www.statehouse.gov.zm/en/ministry-of-information-and-broadcasting-services-p-o-box-50200-lusaka-zambia-tel-260-211-235410/ Ministry of Information, Broadcasting Services and Tourism In Zambia] is responsible for the [[Zambian News Agency]], while there are also numerous media outlets throughout the country which include; [[television station]]s, [[newspaper]]s, [[FM broadcasting|FM radio stations]], and [[Online journalism|Internet news websites]].\n\n===Sports===\n{{Main|Sport in Zambia}}\nZambia declared its independence on the day of the closing ceremony of the [[1964 Summer Olympics]], thereby becoming the first country ever to have entered an Olympic games as one country, and left it as another.

In 1984 Keith Mwila won the bronze medal in the light flyweights. In 1996 Samuel Matete won the silver medal in the 400 meter hurdles. Zambia has never participated in the Winter olympics.\n\n[[Association football|Football]] is the most popular sport in Zambia, and the [[Zambia national football team]] has had its triumphant moments in football history.

[[Kalusha Bwalya]], Zambia's most celebrated football player and one of Africa's greatest football players in history had a hat trick in that match. However, to this day, many pundits say the greatest team Zambia has ever assembled was the one that perished on 28 April 1993 in a [[1993 Zambia national football team air disaster|plane crash]] at [[Libreville, Gabon]]. Despite this, in 1996, Zambia was ranked 15th on the official FIFA World Football Team rankings, the highest attained by any southern African team. In 2012, Zambia won the [[African Cup of Nations]] for the first time after losing in the final twice.

Although there is a difference between street and candid photography, it is usually subtle with most street photography being candid in nature and some [[candid photography]] being classifiable as street photography. Street photography does not necessitate the presence of a street or even the urban environment.  Though people usually feature directly, street photography might be absent of people and can be of an object or environment where the image projects a decidedly human character in facsimile or aesthetic.<ref name=\"West\">[[Colin Westerbeck]].

Allen Lane, London p. 55</ref>\n\nFraming and timing can be key aspects of the craft with the aim of some street photography being to create images at a decisive or poignant moment.\n\nStreet photography can focus on people and their behavior in public, thereby also recording [[people's history]]. This motivation entails having also to navigate or negotiate changing expectations and laws of privacy, security and property. In this respect the street photographer is similar to [[social documentary photography|social documentary photographers]] or [[Photojournalism|photojournalists]] who also work in public places, but with the aim of capturing newsworthy events; any of these photographers' images may capture people and property visible within or from public places. The existence of services like [[Google Street View]], recording public space at a massive scale, and the burgeoning trend of self-photography ([[selfies]]), further complicate ethical issues reflected in attitudes to street photography.\n\nHowever, street photography does not need to exclusively feature people within the frame.  It can also focus on traces left by humanity that say something about life.  Photographers such as [[William Eggleston]] often produce street photography where there are no people in the frame, but their presence is suggested by the subject matter.\n\nMuch of what is regarded, stylistically and subjectively, as definitive street photography was made in the era spanning the end of the 19th century<ref name=\"watts-independent\">{{cite news | url = https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/art/reviews/london-street-photography-museum-of-london-2238534.html | date = 11 March 2011 | accessdate = 28 April 2015 | first = Peter | last = Watts | newspaper = [[The Independent]] | title = London Street Photography, Museum of London}}</ref> through to the late 1970s, a period which saw the emergence of portable cameras that enabled [[candid photography]] in public places.\n\n==History==\n[[Genre art|Depictions of everyday public life form a genre]] in almost every period of world art, beginning in the pre-historic, Sumerian, Egyptian and early Buddhist art periods. Art dealing with the life of the street, whether within views of cityscapes, or as the dominant [[Motif (visual arts)|motif]], appears in the West in the canon of the [[Northern Renaissance]], [[Baroque]], [[Rococo]], of [[Romanticism]], [[Realism (art movement)|Realism]], [[Impressionism]] and [[Post-Impressionism]]. With the type having been so long established in other media, it followed that photographers would also pursue the subject as soon as technology enabled them.\n\n===Nineteenth-century precursors===\n[[File:Boulevard du Temple by Daguerre (unmirrored).jpg|thumb|[[Louis Daguerre]]: ''\"Boulevard du Temple\"'' (1838 or 1839)]]\nIn 1838 or 1839 the first photograph of figures in the street was recorded by [[Louis Daguerre|Louis-Jacques-Mand\u00e9 Daguerre]] in one of a pair of [[daguerreotype]] views taken from his studio window of the [[Boulevard du Temple]] in Paris. The second, made at the height of the day, shows an unpopulated stretch of street, while the other was taken at about 8:00 am, and as Beaumont Newhall reports, \"The Boulevard, so constantly filled with a moving throng of pedestrians and carriages was perfectly solitary, except an individual who was having his boots brushed.

However, there are no exclusions as to what might be used.\n\nTwo commonly used alternative focusing techniques are [[scale-focus|zone focusing]] and [[hyperfocal distance]], either to free the photographer from manual-focus; or where [[autofocus]] is too slow, or the photographer cannot be sure the focus point will fall where the photographer chooses to place their subject in a quickly changing situation; and which also facilitate shooting \"from the hip\" i.e. without bringing the camera up to the eye.\n\nWith ''zone focusing'', the photographer chooses to set the focus to a specific distance, knowing that a certain area in front of and beyond that point will be in focus. The photographer only has to remember to keep their subject between those set distances.\n\nThe ''hyperfocal distance'' technique makes as much as possible ''acceptably'' sharp so that the photographer is freed up even further, from not having to consider the subject's distance, other than not being too close. The photographer sets the focus to a fixed point particular to the lens focal length, and the chosen [[aperture]], and in the case of digital cameras their [[crop factor]]. Thus everything from a specific distance (that will typically be close to the camera), all the way to [[infinity]], will be acceptably sharp. The wider the focal length of the lens (i.e. 28&nbsp;mm), and the smaller the aperture it is set to (i.e. {{f/|11|link=yes}}), and with digital cameras the smaller their crop factor, the closer to the camera is the point at which starts to become acceptably sharp.\n\nAlternatively [[waist-level finder]]s and the [[articulating screen]]s of some digital cameras allow for composing, or adjusting focus, without bringing the camera up to the eye and drawing unwanted attention to the photographer.\n\nAnticipation plays a role where a relevant or ironic background that might act as a foil to a foreground incident or passer-by is carefully framed beforehand; it was a strategy much used for early street photographs, most famously in Cartier-Bresson's figure leaping across a puddle in front of a dance poster in ''Place de l'Europe, Gare Saint Lazare'', 1932.\n\nTony Ray-Jones listed the following shooting advice to himself in his personal journal:<ref>Ray-Jones' archive, [[National Media Museum]], Bradford, England and exhibited by them in the touring exhibition ''Only in England'' in 2015</ref>\n<blockquote>\n* Be more aggressive\n* Get more involved (talk to people)\n* Stay with the subject matter (be patient)\n* Take simpler pictures\n* See if everything in background relates to subject matter\n* Vary compositions and angles more\n* Be more aware of composition\n* Don\u2019t take boring pictures\n* Get in closer (use 50mm lens [or possibly \u2018less,\u2019 the writing is unclear])\n* Watch camera shake (shoot 250 sec or above)\n* Don\u2019t shoot too much\n* Not all eye level\n* No middle distance\n</blockquote>\n\n== Street photography versus documentary photography ==\nStreet photography and [[documentary photography]] can be very similar genres of photography that often overlap while having distinct individual qualities.\n\nDocumentary photographers typically have a defined, premeditated message and an intention to record particular events in history.<ref>Newhall, \"Documentary Approach to Photography\", Parnassus 10, no. 3 (March 1938): pp. 2\u20136. 22</ref> The gamut of the documentary approach encompasses aspects of journalism, art, education, sociology and history.<ref>{{Cite book | author1=Becker, Karin E | title=Dorothea Lange and the documentary tradition | date=1980 | publisher=Louisiana State University Press | page=36|isbn=978-0-8071-0551-1 }}</ref> In social investigation, often documentary images are intended to provoke, or to highlight the need for, societal change.

Photographing people and places in public is legal in most countries protecting freedom of expression and journalistic freedom. There are usually limits on how photos of people may be used and most countries have specific laws regarding people's privacy.\n\nStreet photography may also conflict with laws that were originally established to protect against [[paparazzi]], [[defamation]] or [[harassment]]; and special laws will sometimes apply when taking pictures of minors.\n\n===Canada===\nWhile the common-law provinces follow the United Kingdom, with respect to the freedom to take pictures in a public place, [[Quebec]] law provides that, in most circumstances, their publication can take place only with the consent of the subjects therein.<ref>{{cite CanLII|litigants=Aubry v \u00c9ditions Vice-Versa Inc|link=Aubry v \u00c9ditions Vice-Versa Inc|year=1998|court=scc|num=817|format=canlii|pinpoint=par. 55{{en dash}}59|parallelcite=[1998] 1 SCR 591|date=1998-04-09}}</ref>\n\n===European Union===\nThe European Union's [[Human Rights Act 1998]], which all EU countries have to uphold in their domestic law, establishes in a [[right to privacy]].

The law also protects specifically against defamation\u201d.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.co-berlin.org/en/watch-out|title=Watch Out!|date=21 August 2015}}</ref>\n\nThis right to one's picture, however, does not extend to people who are not the main focus of the picture (e.g. who just wandered into a scene), or who are not even recognizable in the photo. It also does not usually extend to people who are public figures (e.g. politicians or celebrities).\n\nIf a picture is considered art, the courts will also consider the photographer's freedom of artistic expression; meaning that \"artful\" street photography can still be legally published in certain cases.\n\n===Greece===\nProduction, publication and non-commercial sale of street photography is legal in [[Greece]], without the need to have the consent of the shown person or persons.

People have rights to their images (''sh\u014dz\u014dken'', ''droit de image''). The law is especially strict when that which is taken, or the taking, is in any sense shameful.

Although there is a difference between street and candid photography, it is usually subtle with most street photography being candid in nature and some [[candid photography]] being classifiable as street photography. Street photography does not necessitate the presence of a street or even the urban environment.  Though people usually feature directly, street photography might be absent of people and can be of an object or environment where the image projects a decidedly human character in facsimile or aesthetic.<ref name=\"West\">[[Colin Westerbeck]].

Allen Lane, London p. 55</ref>\n\nFraming and timing can be key aspects of the craft with the aim of some street photography being to create images at a decisive or poignant moment.\n\nStreet photography can focus on people and their behavior in public, thereby also recording [[people's history]]. This motivation entails having also to navigate or negotiate changing expectations and laws of privacy, security and property. In this respect the street photographer is similar to [[social documentary photography|social documentary photographers]] or [[Photojournalism|photojournalists]] who also work in public places, but with the aim of capturing newsworthy events; any of these photographers' images may capture people and property visible within or from public places. The existence of services like [[Google Street View]], recording public space at a massive scale, and the burgeoning trend of self-photography ([[selfies]]), further complicate ethical issues reflected in attitudes to street photography.\n\nHowever, street photography does not need to exclusively feature people within the frame.  It can also focus on traces left by humanity that say something about life.  Photographers such as [[William Eggleston]] often produce street photography where there are no people in the frame, but their presence is suggested by the subject matter.\n\nMuch of what is regarded, stylistically and subjectively, as definitive street photography was made in the era spanning the end of the 19th century<ref name=\"watts-independent\">{{cite news | url = https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/art/reviews/london-street-photography-museum-of-london-2238534.html | date = 11 March 2011 | accessdate = 28 April 2015 | first = Peter | last = Watts | newspaper = [[The Independent]] | title = London Street Photography, Museum of London}}</ref> through to the late 1970s, a period which saw the emergence of portable cameras that enabled [[candid photography]] in public places.\n\n==History==\n[[Genre art|Depictions of everyday public life form a genre]] in almost every period of world art, beginning in the pre-historic, Sumerian, Egyptian and early Buddhist art periods.

The acerbic comic vein of Ray-Jones' high-contrast monochromes, which before his premature death were popularized by ''[[Creative Camera]]'' (for which he conducted an interview with [[Brassa\u00ef]]),<ref>'Brassai talking about photography: An interview with Tony Ray-Jones', ''Creative Camera'', April 1970, p. 120.</ref> is mined more recently by [[Martin Parr]] in hyper-saturated colour.\n\n== Technique ==\n{{More citations needed section|date=March 2016}} \nMost kinds of portable camera are used for street photography; for example [[Rangefinder camera|rangefinders]], digital and film [[Single-lens reflex camera|SLR]]s, and [[point-and-shoot cameras]].\n\n[[File:Cartier-Bresson's first Leica.jpg|thumb|right|An example of a hand-held portable camera, the Leica I]]\nThe commonly used [[35mm format|35&nbsp;mm]] full-frame format [[Focal length#In photography|focal lengths]] of [[Wide-angle lens|28]]&nbsp;mm to 50&nbsp;mm, are used particularly for their [[angle of view]] and increased [[depth of field]], with wide-angle lenses potentially permitting a candid close approach to the human subjects without their suspecting they are in the frame. However, there are no exclusions as to what might be used.\n\nTwo commonly used alternative focusing techniques are [[scale-focus|zone focusing]] and [[hyperfocal distance]], either to free the photographer from manual-focus; or where [[autofocus]] is too slow, or the photographer cannot be sure the focus point will fall where the photographer chooses to place their subject in a quickly changing situation; and which also facilitate shooting \"from the hip\" i.e. without bringing the camera up to the eye.\n\nWith ''zone focusing'', the photographer chooses to set the focus to a specific distance, knowing that a certain area in front of and beyond that point will be in focus. The photographer only has to remember to keep their subject between those set distances.\n\nThe ''hyperfocal distance'' technique makes as much as possible ''acceptably'' sharp so that the photographer is freed up even further, from not having to consider the subject's distance, other than not being too close. The photographer sets the focus to a fixed point particular to the lens focal length, and the chosen [[aperture]], and in the case of digital cameras their [[crop factor]]. Thus everything from a specific distance (that will typically be close to the camera), all the way to [[infinity]], will be acceptably sharp. The wider the focal length of the lens (i.e. 28&nbsp;mm), and the smaller the aperture it is set to (i.e. {{f/|11|link=yes}}), and with digital cameras the smaller their crop factor, the closer to the camera is the point at which starts to become acceptably sharp.\n\nAlternatively [[waist-level finder]]s and the [[articulating screen]]s of some digital cameras allow for composing, or adjusting focus, without bringing the camera up to the eye and drawing unwanted attention to the photographer.\n\nAnticipation plays a role where a relevant or ironic background that might act as a foil to a foreground incident or passer-by is carefully framed beforehand; it was a strategy much used for early street photographs, most famously in Cartier-Bresson's figure leaping across a puddle in front of a dance poster in ''Place de l'Europe, Gare Saint Lazare'', 1932.\n\nTony Ray-Jones listed the following shooting advice to himself in his personal journal:<ref>Ray-Jones' archive, [[National Media Museum]], Bradford, England and exhibited by them in the touring exhibition ''Only in England'' in 2015</ref>\n<blockquote>\n* Be more aggressive\n* Get more involved (talk to people)\n* Stay with the subject matter (be patient)\n* Take simpler pictures\n* See if everything in background relates to subject matter\n* Vary compositions and angles more\n* Be more aware of composition\n* Don\u2019t take boring pictures\n* Get in closer (use 50mm lens [or possibly \u2018less,\u2019 the writing is unclear])\n* Watch camera shake (shoot 250 sec or above)\n* Don\u2019t shoot too much\n* Not all eye level\n* No middle distance\n</blockquote>\n\n== Street photography versus documentary photography ==\nStreet photography and [[documentary photography]] can be very similar genres of photography that often overlap while having distinct individual qualities.\n\nDocumentary photographers typically have a defined, premeditated message and an intention to record particular events in history.<ref>Newhall, \"Documentary Approach to Photography\", Parnassus 10, no. 3 (March 1938): pp. 2\u20136. 22</ref> The gamut of the documentary approach encompasses aspects of journalism, art, education, sociology and history.<ref>{{Cite book | author1=Becker, Karin E | title=Dorothea Lange and the documentary tradition | date=1980 | publisher=Louisiana State University Press | page=36|isbn=978-0-8071-0551-1 }}</ref> In social investigation, often documentary images are intended to provoke, or to highlight the need for, societal change.

Photographing people and places in public is legal in most countries protecting freedom of expression and journalistic freedom. There are usually limits on how photos of people may be used and most countries have specific laws regarding people's privacy.\n\nStreet photography may also conflict with laws that were originally established to protect against [[paparazzi]], [[defamation]] or [[harassment]]; and special laws will sometimes apply when taking pictures of minors.\n\n===Canada===\nWhile the common-law provinces follow the United Kingdom, with respect to the freedom to take pictures in a public place, [[Quebec]] law provides that, in most circumstances, their publication can take place only with the consent of the subjects therein.<ref>{{cite CanLII|litigants=Aubry v \u00c9ditions Vice-Versa Inc|link=Aubry v \u00c9ditions Vice-Versa Inc|year=1998|court=scc|num=817|format=canlii|pinpoint=par. 55{{en dash}}59|parallelcite=[1998] 1 SCR 591|date=1998-04-09}}</ref>\n\n===European Union===\nThe European Union's [[Human Rights Act 1998]], which all EU countries have to uphold in their domestic law, establishes in a [[right to privacy]]. This can result in restrictions on the publication of photography.<ref>[[Human Rights Act 1998]] sections 2 & 3</ref> The right to privacy is protected by [[Article 8 of the European Convention on Human Rights|Article 8]] of the convention. In the context of photography, it stands at odds to the [[Article 10 of the European Convention on Human Rights|Article 10]] right of freedom of expression. As such, courts will usually consider the public interest in balancing the rights through the legal test of [[Proportionality (law)|proportionality]].<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/>\n\n===France===\nWhile also limiting photography in order to protect privacy rights, street photography can still be legal in [[France]] when pursued as an art form under certain circumstances. While in one prominent case the freedom of artistic expression trumped the individual's right to privacy, the legality will much depend on the individual case.<ref name=\"laurent-nytimes\">{{cite news | url = http://lens.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/04/23/paris-city-of-rights/ | date = 23 April 2013 | accessdate = 15 February 2015 | first = Olivier | last = Laurent | newspaper = [[The New York Times]] | title = Protecting the Right to Photograph, or Not to Be Photographed}}</ref>\n\n===Germany===\nGermany protects the right to take photos in public, but also recognizes a \"right to one's own picture\". That means that even though pictures can often be ''taken'' without someones consent, they must not be published without the permission of the person in the picture. The law also protects specifically against defamation\u201d.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.co-berlin.org/en/watch-out|title=Watch Out!|date=21 August 2015}}</ref>\n\nThis right to one's picture, however, does not extend to people who are not the main focus of the picture (e.g. who just wandered into a scene), or who are not even recognizable in the photo. It also does not usually extend to people who are public figures (e.g. politicians or celebrities).\n\nIf a picture is considered art, the courts will also consider the photographer's freedom of artistic expression; meaning that \"artful\" street photography can still be legally published in certain cases.\n\n===Greece===\nProduction, publication and non-commercial sale of street photography is legal in [[Greece]], without the need to have the consent of the shown person or persons. In Greece the right to take photographs and publish them or sell licensing rights over them as fine art or editorial content is protected by the [[Constitution of Greece]] (Article 14<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.hellenicparliament.gr/Vouli-ton-Ellinon/To-Politevma/Syntagma/article-14/|title=\u03a3\u03cd\u03bd\u03c4\u03b1\u03b3\u03bc\u03b1}}</ref> and other articles) and free speech laws as well as by [[Precedent|case law]] and legal cases. Photographing the police and publishing the photographs is also legal.\n\nPhotography and video-taking is also permitted across the whole [[Athens Metro]] transport network,<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.synigoros.gr/resources/docs/199930.pdf|title=synigoros.gr}}</ref> which is very popular among Greek street photographers.\n\n===Hungary===\nIn [[Hungary]], from 15 March 2014 anyone taking photographs is technically breaking the law if someone wanders into shot, under a new civil code that outlaws taking pictures without the permission of everyone in the photograph. This expands the law on consent to include the taking of photographs, in addition to their publication.<ref>{{cite news | url = https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/mar/14/hungary-law-photography-permission-take-pictures | date = 14 March 2014 | accessdate = 20 May 2014 | first = Daniel | last = Nolan | publisher = [[The Guardian]] | title = Hungary law requires photographers to ask permission to take pictures}}</ref>\n\n===Japan===\nIn Japan permission, or at least signification of intent to photo and the absence of refusal, is needed both for photography and for publication of photos of ''recognisable'' people even in public places. 'Hidden photography' (''kakushidori'' hidden, surreptitious photography) 'stolen photography' (''nusumitori'' with no intention of getting permission) and \"fast photography' (''hayayori'' before permission and refusal can be given) are forbidden unless in the former permission is obtained from the subject immediately after taking the photo. People have rights to their images (''sh\u014dz\u014dken'', ''droit de image''). The law is especially strict when that which is taken, or the taking, is in any sense shameful. Exception is made for photos of famous people in public places and news photography by registered news media outlets where favour is given to the public right to know.<ref name=\"ISSN\">{{cite journal |title=\u8096\u50cf\u6a29\u3068\u305d\u306e\u5468\u8fba : \u5199\u771f\u306e\u64ae\u5f71\u30fb\u516c\u8868\u3092\u3081\u3050\u308b\u6cd5\u5f8b\u554f\u984c\u3068\u5224\u4f8b\u306e\u5c55\u958b |journal=Journal of Law and Politics |language=Japanese |trans-title=Study on the Rules for taking a Photograph of a Person and its Publication in Japan |year=2000| last=Murakami |first=Takashi |volume=39 |pages= 25\u2013112 |url=http://ci.nii.ac.jp/lognavi?name=nels&lang=en&type=pdf&id=ART0009133241 |format=PDF |issn=0915-0463 |accessdate=2016-12-07 }}</ref>\n\n===South Africa===\nIn [[South Africa]], photographing people in public is legal.{{Citation needed|date=October 2016}} Reproducing and selling photographs of people is legal for editorial and limited fair use commercial purposes.
