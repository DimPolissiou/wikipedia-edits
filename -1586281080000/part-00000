The first phase comprises abstract [[Modernist literature|modernist]] works influenced by writers such as [[Franz Kafka]], [[Samuel Beckett]], [[Alain Robbe-Grillet]] and [[James Joyce]]. These works examine the capacity of [[language]] to depict [[reality]]; they include the experimental novels ''The Visit'' (''Bes\u00f8get'', 1963) and ''Additions'' (''Tilf\u00f8jelser'', 1967), the \"unnovel\" ''Pictures of Lust'' (''Lystbilleder'', 1964), and the collection of short stories ''Eight Times Orphan'' (''Otte gange orphan'', 1965).\n\nMadsen would later define these novels as \"anti-art\". The change to the next phase of his work was, according to him, a shift from \"anti-art\" to \"anti-anti-art\", which accepted the result of the first phase: \"that reality can not be described\", but that one may attempt to build a meaningful literature from a [[Relativism|relativistic]] stance. The project was now to show how \"lower\" genres (such as [[crime fiction]], [[Romance novel|romantic fiction]] and [[science fiction]]) could be a mosaic of equal truths that make up reality. This change is also a change from modernist literature to [[postmodern literature]].\n\nThe third phase of Madsen's work comprises some novels that are less abstract and more realistic than his earlier works, but are still highly imaginative. At the same time, Madsen started working on a \"macro\"-text in which characters are used repeatedly in different novels, main characters becoming minor characters and vice versa. All of these novels take places in the [[city]] of [[Aarhus]] in Denmark. Through a complex net of bizarre stories, Madsen creates an alternative Aarhus in which everything is possible and extreme philosophical positions are explored. Madsen's late literature is quite unique but can perhaps best be likened to the [[magical realism]] of [[Latin America]].\n\nA recurring trait in his books is that the [[Fictional character|characters]] face some sort of extreme situation which enables a philosophical theme to emerge.\n\nPerhaps Madsen's most famous work is ''Vice and Virtue in the Middle Time'' (''Tugt og utugt i mellemtiden'', 1976) which has been translated into English. In this novel, a man from a very distant future takes on the experiment of writing a novel of the age called Middle Time, which is the western world in the 1970s. This creates an amusing philosophical position, in which everything we take for granted is questioned in the light of a totally different perspective on life. The main [[Plot (narrative)|plot]] is a rewriting of [[Alexandre Dumas, p\u00e8re]]'s ''[[The Count of Monte Cristo]]'', but there are references to many classic novels.\n\n==Bibliography==\nMadsen's books, and some of his plays, have been translated in to a wide array of languages, from Czech and Greek to Latvian, French and Japanese. This includes English as well, however, most of them have not been translated.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.svendaagemadsen.dk/oversaettelser?lang=en|title=Translations|website=www.svendaagemadsen.dk|publisher=Svend Aage Madsen|accessdate=13 September 2018}}</ref>\n\nThe following books may be considered to be Madsen's most important:\n* The Windrose, (Vindrosen) 1962 [Short story]\n* The Visit (Bes\u00f8get), 1963\n* Pictures of Lust (Lystbilleder), 1964\n* Eight Times Orphan (Otte gange Orphan), 1965.\n* Additions (Tilf\u00f8jelser), 1967\n* The Corpse and the Lust (Liget og lysten), 1968\n* The Third Time, We'll Take Him (Tredje gang s\u00e5 ta'r vi ham...), 1969\n* The Masked Ball (Maskeballet), 1970.

Madsen's late literature is quite unique but can perhaps best be likened to the [[magical realism]] of [[Latin America]].\n\nA recurring trait in his books is that the [[Fictional character|characters]] face some sort of extreme situation which enables a philosophical theme to emerge.\n\nPerhaps Madsen's most famous work is ''Vice and Virtue in the Middle Time'' (''Tugt og utugt i mellemtiden'', 1976) which has been translated into English. In this novel, a man from a very distant future takes on the experiment of writing a novel of the age called Middle Time, which is the western world in the 1970s. This creates an amusing philosophical position, in which everything we take for granted is questioned in the light of a totally different perspective on life. The main [[Plot (narrative)|plot]] is a rewriting of [[Alexandre Dumas, p\u00e8re]]'s ''[[The Count of Monte Cristo]]'', but there are references to many classic novels.\n\n==Bibliography==\nMadsen's books, and some of his plays, have been translated in to a wide array of languages, from Czech and Greek to Latvian, French and Japanese.

Jin's Chunzhi Yangyan was so strong that Tushan couldn't fight against him. However, Dongfang Yuechu asked Tushan Honghong to use her hand through his heart and he kissed her immediately. Honghong got strong spirit power from that and finally Jin failed. After the attack. Yuechu used his diluted blood to wash her hands so that she was not afraid of Chunzhi Yangyan. Yuechu loved Honghong so much that he was ready to confess to her on Double Seventh Festival which day that Niulang and Zhinu meet each other every year in Chinese traditional legend. After Tushan Rongrong knew his idea, she told him that Honghong often went to Shuangsheng Mountain(\u53cc\u751f\u5cf0) on that festival. When Yuechu arrived there, he just saw Honghong walked into an icy cave and sat in front of a dead little Taoist body. Honghong knew he was nearby and said something to him on propose. Then Yuechu knew that she and Rongrong were caught by two Taoists when they were young. But while the elder one sleeping, the little one wanted to save these two fox spirits. Honghong remaineded of something that be told by an elder fox spirit, she just thought the little one would kill her so she uesd her hand through his heart but she understood his real motivation at that moment. The little Taoist told her his thoughts and died soon. Honghong was very guilty and it left a shadow in her heart. She couldn't do what she wanted even couldn't love others. Yuechu was distressed after knowing the fact and left Tushan for 50 years.\n\nIn these years, the friendship between human beings and spirits became worse than before. Yuechu experienced something important and became much stronger. He became the host of Yiqi Taoist League. At that time, people still thought Tushan fox spirits often killed people. Only Yuechu and Wangquan Fugui knew the fact: the black fox spirits(\u9ed1\u72d0) broke the peace. Yuechu and Fugui talked about how to let people belive the fact. Yuechu pretended to believe black fox spirits' plan and fight Honghong in order to lure black fox spirit to show up. But he knew the end clearly, it's a bet of his whole life. After fighting, the Queen of balck fox spirit showed up. Honghong knew his real idea and was moved. Yuechu left Tushan 50 years ago just wanted to achieve her dream, a dream about the peace between people and spirits. Until this moment, Honghong expressed her love to Yuechu and Yuechu got his magic item, Xukong Zhilei(\u865a\u7a7a\u4e4b\u6cea, means the tears of void).

But Tushan was attacked by black fox spirits, Beishan Yaodi(real name is Shi Kuan(\u77f3\u5bbd)) and Tushan Meimei(\u6d82\u5c71\u7f8e\u7f8e, a member of black fox spirits). Tushan Susu became Honghong temporarily but was controlled by Meimei. To save her, Bai and Rongrong came into her dream and finally saw Honghong and Dongfang Yuechu's soul. Susu became back. With the help of Bai and Susu's help, Shi Kuan was back to normal and accepted a girl whose reincarnation was the Princess of Yuyao Guo(\u5fa1\u5996\u56fd) and Shi was her lover in their former life.\n\nAll of spirits in Tushan and people in Yiqi Taoist League wanted Tushan Honghong could really be back, so Tushan Yaya asked Bai to marry Susu.

It tells about the love between Dongfang Yuechu and Tushan Honghong. Tushan Honghong was the Queen of Tushan. Dongfang Yuechu came from Dongfang family, whose members could use magic kill-spirit fire, Chunzhi Yangyan(\u7eaf\u8d28\u9633\u708e, means pure sun fire). His parents were killed by Huhe Shuangxian(\u864e\u9e64\u53cc\u4ed9, a two-spirits group) so he ran to Tushan and was saved by Tushan Honghong.

Jin's Chunzhi Yangyan was so strong that Tushan couldn't fight against him. However, Dongfang Yuechu asked Tushan Honghong to use her hand through his heart and he kissed her immediately. Honghong got strong spirit power from that and finally Jin failed. After the attack. Yuechu used his diluted blood to wash her hands so that she was not afraid of Chunzhi Yangyan. Yuechu loved Honghong so much that he was ready to confess to her on Double Seventh Festival which day that Niulang and Zhinu meet each other every year in Chinese traditional legend. After Tushan Rongrong knew his idea, she told him that Honghong often went to Shuangsheng Mountain(\u53cc\u751f\u5cf0) on that festival. When Yuechu arrived there, he just saw Honghong walked into an icy cave and sat in front of a dead little Taoist body. Honghong knew he was nearby and said something to him on propose. Then Yuechu knew that she and Rongrong were caught by two Taoists when they were young. But while the elder one sleeping, the little one wanted to save these two fox spirits. Honghong remaineded of something that be told by an elder fox spirit, she just thought the little one would kill her so she uesd her hand through his heart but she understood his real motivation at that moment. The little Taoist told her his thoughts and died soon. Honghong was very guilty and it left a shadow in her heart. She couldn't do what she wanted even couldn't love others. Yuechu was distressed after knowing the fact and left Tushan for 50 years.\n\nIn these years, the friendship between human beings and spirits became worse than before. Yuechu experienced something important and became much stronger. He became the host of Yiqi Taoist League. At that time, people still thought Tushan fox spirits often killed people. Only Yuechu and Wangquan Fugui knew the fact: the black fox spirits(\u9ed1\u72d0) broke the peace. Yuechu and Fugui talked about how to let people belive the fact. Yuechu pretended to believe black fox spirits' plan and fight Honghong in order to lure black fox spirit to show up. But he knew the end clearly, it's a bet of his whole life. After fighting, the Queen of balck fox spirit showed up. Honghong knew his real idea and was moved. Yuechu left Tushan 50 years ago just wanted to achieve her dream, a dream about the peace between people and spirits. Until this moment, Honghong expressed her love to Yuechu and Yuechu got his magic item, Xukong Zhilei(\u865a\u7a7a\u4e4b\u6cea, means the tears of void). The Queen really wanted to get it, she seriously hurt Yuechu. But the magic item had been become Yuechu and Honghong's magic item of love continuation in their heart. The Queen couldn't kill them if she wanted the complete item. Honghong started the love continuation, Dongfang Yuechu was dead and Tushan Honghong lost her spirit power and memory, become Tushan Susu.\n\nIn Tushan Theater, people knew what happened 500 years ago in Bai Yuechu's reincarnation and Tushan Susu. But Tushan was attacked by black fox spirits, Beishan Yaodi(real name is Shi Kuan(\u77f3\u5bbd)) and Tushan Meimei(\u6d82\u5c71\u7f8e\u7f8e, a member of black fox spirits). Tushan Susu became Honghong temporarily but was controlled by Meimei. To save her, Bai and Rongrong came into her dream and finally saw Honghong and Dongfang Yuechu's soul. Susu became back. With the help of Bai and Susu's help, Shi Kuan was back to normal and accepted a girl whose reincarnation was the Princess of Yuyao Guo(\u5fa1\u5996\u56fd) and Shi was her lover in their former life.\n\nAll of spirits in Tushan and people in Yiqi Taoist League wanted Tushan Honghong could really be back, so Tushan Yaya asked Bai to marry Susu. At the wedding ceremony. Bai sightly asked Susu whether she wanted to be a real excellent matchmaker or not. Susu was exhuasted but finally she expressed her real idea that she didn't want to marry, she just wanted to be an excellent matchmaker. Bai kissed her and she bacame Honghong flying away. Yaya wanted to catch her but Bai said if she did that he would die again. \"If you don't force us to marry right now, I can promise you, I will bring her back, and as she becomes the best matchmaker, I'll woo her, and make her truly fall in love with me.\"\n\n== Anime ==\nThe Japanese version was broadcast in [[Tokyo MX]] between 2017-7-1 and 2017-12-16.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://enmusuyouko.com/news-01/|title=\u7e01\u7d50\u3073\u306e\u5996\u72d0\u3061\u3083\u3093-2017\u5e747\u67081\u65e5\u30aa\u30f3\u30a8\u30a2\u958b\u59cb\uff01\uff01 {{!}} \u30a2\u30cb\u30e1 \u300c\u7e01\u7d50\u3073\u306e\u5996\u72d0\u3061\u3083\u3093\u300d \u516c\u5f0f\u30b5\u30a4\u30c8|language=ja|access-date=2020-02-15}}</ref>\n\nSince Zhuye Chapter, the broadcasting rights only belongs to Tencent Video.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://ent.huanqiu.com/article/9CaKrnKiAqD|title=\u56fd\u6f2b\u300a\u72d0\u5996\u5c0f\u7ea2\u5a18\u300b\"\u7af9\u4e1a\u7bc7\"\u817e\u8baf\u72ec\u5bb6\u5f00\u64ad|website=ent.huanqiu.com|access-date=2020-02-15}}</ref>\n\n== Mobile Game ==\nThe game was operated by [[Tencent Game]] Aurora Studios and tested publicly in November 2019.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.9game.cn/hyxhn/3907653.html|title=\u300a\u72d0\u5996\u5c0f\u7ea2\u5a18\u300b\u4ec0\u4e48\u65f6\u5019\u516c\u6d4b \u5168\u5e73\u53f0\u516c\u6d4b\u65f6\u95f4\u516c\u5e03_\u72d0\u5996\u5c0f\u7ea2\u5a18\u624b\u6e38_\u4e5d\u6e38\u624b\u673a\u6e38\u620f|website=www.9game.cn|access-date=2020-02-15}}</ref> It uses [[Unity3D]] as its engine and game type is [[MMORPG]] with traditional Chinese style.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://cloud.tencent.com/developer/news/510964|title=\u72d0\u5996\u5c0f\u7ea2\u5a18\u624b\u6e38\uff1a\u56fd\u6f2b\u98ce\u683c\u7684RPG\u7c7b\u6e38\u620f\uff0c\u6e38\u620f\u4ee3\u5165\u611f\u8d85\u5f3a\uff01 - \u4e91+\u793e\u533a - \u817e\u8baf\u4e91|website=cloud.tencent.com|access-date=2020-02-15}}</ref>\n\n== Influence ==\nWhen Fox Spirit Matchmaker was appeared, it has had a lot of impact, there have high clicks on many major platforms.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.sohu.com/a/322224170_565158|title=\u72d0\u5996\u5c0f\u7ea2\u5a18\u64ad\u653e\u91cf\u7a81\u783450\u4ebf\uff0c\u9605\u6587\u52a8\u753b\u70b9\u51fb\u91cf\u7834\u767e\u4ebf\uff0c\u56fd\u6f2bIP\u664b\u7ea7\u4e0b\u4e00\u7ad9\uff1aIP\u884d\u751f\u6388\u6743\u5e02\u573a_\u4e2d\u56fd|website=www.sohu.com|language=en|access-date=2020-02-19}}</ref> To enrich Chinese culture industry and improve cultural travel level, Tencent has carried out many multi-faceted cooperation.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://k.sina.cn/article_6216747334_1728c094601900j6oe.html|title=\u5e03\u5c40\u5168\u56fd\u3001\u64ac\u52a8\u5168\u7f51\uff0c\u300a\u72d0\u5996\u5c0f\u7ea2\u5a18\u300bIP\u5f71\u54cd\u529b\u5230\u5e95\u6709\u591a\u5f3a\uff1f|last=sina_mobile|date=2019-05-17|website=k.sina.cn|access-date=2020-02-19}}</ref>\n\nIn December 2018, Hangzhou Animation Bus officially joined hands with Tencent Animation to launch No.51 \"pure love bus\".
