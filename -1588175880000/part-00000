The team is coached by [[Kurtis Foster]] and the general manager is Darren Keily. The Frontenacs play home games at the [[Rogers K-Rock Centre|Leon's Centre]], which opened in 2008.\n\nTeam history predates the OHA, back to 1945, to a team known as the Kingston Victorias. This franchise was founded in the OHA in [[1973\u201374 OHA season|1973\u201374]], then known as the [[Kingston Canadians]] until [[1987\u201388 OHL season|1987\u201388]]. The team was briefly known as the [[Kingston Raiders]] in [[1988\u201389 OHL season|1988\u201389]], and as the Frontenacs ever since.\n\n==History==\nThe original Kingston Frontenacs were founded in 1897, named after [[Louis de Buade de Frontenac]], governor of New France, who established [[Fort Frontenac]] on the site of present-day Kingston.<ref>{{cite book|last=Fitsell|first=J.W.

Sutherland: The Grand Old Man of Hockey & The Battle for the Original Hockey Hall of Fame|publisher=Quarry Heritage Books|page=30|date=2012|location=Kingston, Ontario|isbn=978-1-55082-374-5}}</ref>\n\nFrom 1959 to 1963, there was also a [[Kingston Frontenacs (EPHL)|Kingston Frontenacs team]] in the [[Eastern Professional Hockey League (1959\u201363)|Eastern Professional Hockey League]].\n\n===Before 1945===\nThe city had a team in the Ontario Hockey Association (OHA) Jr. league in the 1910s. NHL Alumni from this team are [[Alec Connell]], [[Bill Cook]], [[Scotty Davidson|Allan Davidson]] and [[Flat Walsh]].\n\nAn Ontario Hockey Association (OHA) Sr. League team also existed from the 1910s to 1940s. NHL Alumni from this team are [[Mickey Blake]], [[Glen Brydson]], [[Bill Cook]], [[Gus Giesebrecht]], [[Doug Stevenson]], [[Charles Stewart (ice hockey)|Charles Stewart]], [[Carl Voss]] and [[Flat Walsh]].\n\nSome members of this team then formed an entry in the Ontario Veteran's Hockey League (OVHL) during [[World War II]]. NHL Alumni from this team are [[Hub Macey]], [[Gus Marker]], [[Walt McCartney]] and [[Ed Nicholson]].\n\n===1952\u20131973===\nIn 1952, the Kingston Victoria were renamed the Kingston Frontenacs. This team played at the Junior B level, then later at the Junior A level. This Frontenacs team lost in the 1963 [[Sutherland Cup]] final to the [[St. Marys Lincolns]], 4 games to 1.\n[[File:Kingston Junior Frontenacs OHA Jr Semi-Finalists 1963-64.jpg|thumb|Kingston Junior Frontenacs OHA Jr Semi-Finalists 1963-64]]\n\n===Kingston Canadians (1973\u20131988)===\nThe Kingston Canadians arrival in the Ontario Hockey Association (OHA) for the 1973\u201374 season, was a result of the [[Montreal Junior Canadiens]] switch to the [[Quebec Major Junior Hockey League]] (QMJHL) in 1972. During the summer of 1972, the QMJHL had threatened a lawsuit against the OHA to force the Junior Canadiens to return to the Quebec-based league. To solve the problem, the OHA granted the Junior Canadiens franchise a \"one-year suspension\" of operations, while team ownership transferred the team and players into the QMJHL, renaming themselves the [[Montreal Bleu Blanc Rouge]] in the process.\n\nAfter a one-year hiatus, the OHA then reactivated the suspended franchise under new ownership and with new players, calling the team the Kingston Canadians. The new Kingston team was essentially an expansion franchise promoted from the OHA's [[Ontario Provincial Junior A Hockey League|Tier II]] league, that had only common name to share with the old Junior Canadiens. The Tier II Frontenacs originated in the [[Eastern Junior B Hockey League]] and date back to at least the early 1940s as the Kingston Victorias. However, in some OHA histories (such as the annual Media Guide) the Kingston team is still shown as the legitimate successors of the Junior Canadiens' legacy.\n\n===Kingston Raiders (1988\u201389)===\nFollowing a change in ownership the club was renamed '''[[Kingston Raiders]]''' for one season in 1988\u201389. Due to ownership problems, the team was sold again following that season.\n\n===Kingston Frontenacs (1989\u2013present)===\nIn 1989, the new ownership, including Wren Blair, Don Anderson and Bob Attersley, renamed the team '''Kingston Frontenacs''' after the [[Kingston Frontenacs (EPHL)|Eastern Professional Hockey League team]]. The [[Boston Bruins]]-style uniforms and logos were revived from the old franchise. The city embraced and welcomed the new ownership.  Wren Blair and Bob Attersley were both hockey legends in their own right. In 1997 Wren Blair would be honoured with the '''Bill Long Award''' for distinguished service in the OHL.  The club was sold to the Springer family of Kingston in June 1998, with Doug Springer becoming the owner and governor.\n\nThe Frontenacs franchise has the second-longest [[List of CHL franchise post-season droughts|championship drought]] in the OHL (to the [[Sudbury Wolves]] by one year), and the fourth-longest in the [[Canadian Hockey League]]. The Frontenacs won the [[Leyden Trophy]] as the OHL's East Division champions in the [[1994\u201395 OHL season|1994\u201395]] and [[2015\u201316 OHL season|2015\u201316]]. In the [[1992\u201393 OHL season|1992\u201393 season]], the Frontenacs reached the Eastern Conference Final but lost to the Peterborough Petes. In [[2017-18 OHL season|2017-18]], Kingston reached the Eastern Conference final for the second time in club history, however, they lost to the Hamilton Bulldogs.\n\n==Coaches==\nDuring the inaugural season of the [[Kingston Canadians]] in 1973\u201374, [[Jack Bownass]] was awarded the [[Matt Leyden Trophy]] as OHA Coach of the Year. Former NHL defenceman [[Jim Morrison (ice hockey)|Jim Morrison]] coached the team from 1975 to 1982, which was the longest stint a coach had when the club was known as the Canadians.\n\n[[Larry Mavety]] coached the Frontenacs for much of the team's history. He originally coached the team in 1988\u201389, when they were still known as the [[Kingston Raiders]]. In 1989\u201390, the first season the franchise was known as the Frontenacs, he won the [[Matt Leyden Trophy]] as the OHL Coach of the Year. Mavety returned to Kingston in 1997 to become the head coach once again, and stayed in that position until midway through the 2002\u201303 season when he stepped down to focus on his general manager duties. After a slow start in the 2007\u201308 season, Mavety once again found himself coaching the Frontenacs until November 2008. Mavety remained as the general manager until the end of the 2010\u201311 season.\n\nThe Frontenacs had head coaches that were also head coaches in the [[National Hockey League]], including [[Dave Allison]],  [[Gary Agnew]], and [[Bruce Cassidy]].\n\n===List of coaches===\n''(Multiple years in parentheses, totals include all incarnations of the Kingston franchise)''\n{|\n|-\n| valign=top width=40% |\n*'''1973\u201375''' [[Jack Bownass]] (2)\n*'''1975\u201382''' [[Jim Morrison (ice hockey)|Jim Morrison]] (7)\n*'''1982\u201383''' [[Rod Graham]]\n*'''1983\u201385''' Rick Cornacchia (2)\n*'''1985\u201385''' [[Jim Dorey]] (2)\n*'''1985\u201387''' [[Fred O'Donnell]] (2)\n*'''1987\u201388''' Jacques Tremblay\n*'''1988\u201388''' [[Jim Dorey]] (2)\n*'''1988\u201390''' [[Larry Mavety]] (10)\n*'''1990\u201391''' Randy Hall\n*'''1991\u201392''' Paul Cook\n*'''1992\u201394''' [[Dave Allison]] (2)\n| valign=top width=40% |\n*'''1994\u201397''' [[Gary Agnew]] (3)\n*'''1997\u20132003''' Larry Mavety (10)\n*'''2002\u201303''' Greg Bignell\n*'''2003\u201306''' [[Jim Hulton]] (3)\n*'''2006\u201307''' [[Bruce Cassidy]] (2)\n*'''2007\u201308''' Larry Mavety (10)\n*'''2008\u201311''' [[Doug Gilmour]] (3)\n*'''2011\u201314''' [[Todd Gill]] (3)\n*'''2014\u201317''' Paul McFarland (3)\n*'''2017\u201318''' Jay Varady<ref>{{cite web |url=http://kingstonfrontenacs.com/article/news-frontenacs-announce-jay-varady-as-head-coach |title=[NEWS] Frontenacs announce Jay Varady as Head Coach |publisher=Frontenacs |date=July 13, 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.nhl.com/coyotes/news/coyotes-name-varady-head-coach-of-tucson-roadrunners/c-299391598 |title=Coyotes Name Varady Head Coach of Tucson Roadrunners |publisher=[[Arizona Coyotes]] |date=July 2, 2018}}</ref>\n*'''2018\u201320''' [[Kurtis Foster]]<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.oursportscentral.com/services/releases/kurtis-foster-promoted-to-head-coach-luca-caputi-named-as-associate-coach/n-5370244 |title=Kurtis Foster Promoted to Head Coach, Luca Caputi Named as Associate Coach |website=OurSportsCentral.com |date=July 16, 2018}}</ref>\n|}\n\n==Players==\n'''[[Paul Coffey]]''' is the only former member of the Kingston franchise to be inducted into the [[Hockey Hall of Fame]], getting the honour in 2004.

The logo featured a yellow letter 'K' with a black outline, surrounded by black spokes leading to a yellow circle border with the name Kingston Frontenacs in black.\n\nIn 2002, the team adopted a new logo with a stylized [[Louis de Buade de Frontenac|Count Frontenac]]. The jerseys feature a star striping pattern similar to Dallas of the NHL, and a modified version of the former \"K\" logo is used on the shoulder.\n\nIn 2007, the Frontenacs unveiled a 3rd jersey, which was black, yellow and white, and very similar looking to the [[Boston Bruins]] jerseys from the early 1970s. The \"K\" logo was used on the front of the jersey.  The Frontenacs began wearing these jerseys on February 22, 2008, which was the same night that they opened their new arena.\n\nIn 2008, The Frontenacs unveiled a new 3rd jersey which was worn at home between opening night and New Years barring 2 games where the black star jersey was worn. The {{sic|hide=yes|new jersey}} was a white version of the black alternate which was worn for the second half of the season.\n\nIn 2009, the Frontenacs, along with all CHL teams unveiled new uniforms using RBK EDGE templates. In 2012, the Frontenacs began wearing a newly designed set of uniforms featuring a large K as a logo.\n\n==Arenas==\nThe former home arena of the Frontenacs was the [[Kingston Memorial Centre]], with a [[seating capacity]] 3,079 seated, and 3,300 including standing room. Built in 1950, its ice size has unique dimensions of 200' x 92'. The Frontenacs' final game was played at the Memorial Center on February 15, 2008, a 6\u20134 win over the [[London Knights]]. Kyle Paige scored the final goal ever at the Memorial Centre.\n\nThe Kingston Frontenacs began play at their new downtown arena, the [[Rogers K-Rock Centre|Leon's Centre]] (then the K-Rock Centre) on February 22, 2008, in a 3\u20132 loss to the [[Belleville Bulls]]. The Frontenacs' first win at the Leon's Centre came on February 24, 2008 when they defeated the [[Peterborough Petes]] by a score of 7\u20134.\n\n==See also==\n*[[List of ice hockey teams in Ontario]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* {{official website|http://www.kingstonfrontenacs.com}}\n\n{{Kingston Frontenacs}}\n{{OHL}}\n{{OPJAHL}}\n{{Ontario Sports}}\n\n[[Category:Ice hockey clubs established in 1989]]\n[[Category:Ontario Hockey League teams]]\n[[Category:Sport in Kingston, Ontario]]\n[[Category:1989 establishments in Ontario]]\n", "text_old": "{{distinguish|Kingston Frontenacs (EPHL)}}\n{{Multiple issues|\n{{original research|date=April 2015}}\n{{more citations needed|date=August 2017}}\n}}\n\n{{Infobox hockey team\n| team       = Kingston Frontenacs\n| colour      = background:#FFFFFF; border-top:#FDB827 5px solid; border-bottom:#000000 5px solid;\n| colour text = #000000\n| logo       = Kingston_Frontenacs_Logo.png\n| city       = [[Kingston, Ontario]]\n| league     = [[Ontario Hockey League]]\n| conference = Eastern\n| division   = East\n| founded    = [[1989\u201390 OHL season|{{Start date|1989}}\u201390]]\n| arena      = [[Leon's Centre]]\n| colours    = Black, gold and white <br> {{Color box|#000000}} {{Color box|#FDB827}} {{Color box|#FFFFFF}}\n| coach      = [[Kurtis Foster]]\n| GM         = Darren Keily\n| affiliates = [[Kingston Voyageurs]]\n| website    = [http://www.kingstonfrontenacs.com/ www.kingstonfrontenacs.com]\n<!-- Franchise history below -->\n| name1      = Kingston Victorias\n| dates1     = 1945\u20131952\n| name2      = Kingston Frontenacs\n| dates2     = 1952\u20131973\n| name3      = [[Kingston Canadians]]\n| dates3     = 1973\u20131988\n| name4      = [[Kingston Raiders]]\n| dates4     = 1988\u20131989\n| name5      = Kingston Frontenacs\n| dates5     = 1989\u2013present\n}}\n\n[[Image:frontsaction.jpg|thumb|Frontenacs pre-game skate.]]\nThe '''Kingston Frontenacs''' are a [[junior ice hockey]] team in the [[Ontario Hockey League]], based in [[Kingston, Ontario]], Canada.

The team was briefly known as the [[Kingston Raiders]] in [[1988\u201389 OHL season|1988\u201389]], and as the Frontenacs ever since.\n\n==History==\nThe original Kingston Frontenacs were founded in 1897, named after [[Louis de Buade de Frontenac]], governor of New France, who established [[Fort Frontenac]] on the site of present-day Kingston.<ref>{{cite book|last=Fitsell|first=J.W.

NHL Alumni from this team are [[Alec Connell]], [[Bill Cook]], [[Scotty Davidson|Allan Davidson]] and [[Flat Walsh]].\n\nAn Ontario Hockey Association (OHA) Sr. League team also existed from the 1910s to 1940s. NHL Alumni from this team are [[Mickey Blake]], [[Glen Brydson]], [[Bill Cook]], [[Gus Giesebrecht]], [[Doug Stevenson]], [[Charles Stewart (ice hockey)|Charles Stewart]], [[Carl Voss]] and [[Flat Walsh]].\n\nSome members of this team then formed an entry in the Ontario Veteran's Hockey League (OVHL) during [[World War II]]. NHL Alumni from this team are [[Hub Macey]], [[Gus Marker]], [[Walt McCartney]] and [[Ed Nicholson]].\n\n===1952\u20131973===\nIn 1952, the Kingston Victoria were renamed the Kingston Frontenacs. This team played at the Junior B level, then later at the Junior A level. This Frontenacs team lost in the 1963 [[Sutherland Cup]] final to the [[St. Marys Lincolns]], 4 games to 1.\n[[File:Kingston Junior Frontenacs OHA Jr Semi-Finalists 1963-64.jpg|thumb|Kingston Junior Frontenacs OHA Jr Semi-Finalists 1963-64]]\n\n===Kingston Canadians (1973\u20131988)===\nThe Kingston Canadians arrival in the Ontario Hockey Association (OHA) for the 1973\u201374 season, was a result of the [[Montreal Junior Canadiens]] switch to the [[Quebec Major Junior Hockey League]] (QMJHL) in 1972. During the summer of 1972, the QMJHL had threatened a lawsuit against the OHA to force the Junior Canadiens to return to the Quebec-based league. To solve the problem, the OHA granted the Junior Canadiens franchise a \"one-year suspension\" of operations, while team ownership transferred the team and players into the QMJHL, renaming themselves the [[Montreal Bleu Blanc Rouge]] in the process.\n\nAfter a one-year hiatus, the OHA then reactivated the suspended franchise under new ownership and with new players, calling the team the Kingston Canadians. The new Kingston team was essentially an expansion franchise promoted from the OHA's [[Ontario Provincial Junior A Hockey League|Tier II]] league, that had only common name to share with the old Junior Canadiens. The Tier II Frontenacs originated in the [[Eastern Junior B Hockey League]] and date back to at least the early 1940s as the Kingston Victorias. However, in some OHA histories (such as the annual Media Guide) the Kingston team is still shown as the legitimate successors of the Junior Canadiens' legacy.\n\n===Kingston Raiders (1988\u201389)===\nFollowing a change in ownership the club was renamed '''[[Kingston Raiders]]''' for one season in 1988\u201389. Due to ownership problems, the team was sold again following that season.\n\n===Kingston Frontenacs (1989\u2013present)===\nIn 1989, the new ownership, including Wren Blair, Don Anderson and Bob Attersley, renamed the team '''Kingston Frontenacs''' after the [[Kingston Frontenacs (EPHL)|Eastern Professional Hockey League team]]. The [[Boston Bruins]]-style uniforms and logos were revived from the old franchise. The city embraced and welcomed the new ownership.  Wren Blair and Bob Attersley were both hockey legends in their own right. In 1997 Wren Blair would be honoured with the '''Bill Long Award''' for distinguished service in the OHL.  The club was sold to the Springer family of Kingston in June 1998, with Doug Springer becoming the owner and governor.\n\nThe Frontenacs franchise has the second-longest [[List of CHL franchise post-season droughts|championship drought]] in the OHL (to the [[Sudbury Wolves]] by one year), and the fourth-longest in the [[Canadian Hockey League]]. The Frontenacs won the [[Leyden Trophy]] as the OHL's East Division champions in the [[1994\u201395 OHL season|1994\u201395]] and [[2015\u201316 OHL season|2015\u201316]]. In the [[1992\u201393 OHL season|1992\u201393 season]], the Frontenacs reached the Eastern Conference Final but lost to the Peterborough Petes. In [[2017-18 OHL season|2017-18]], Kingston reached the Eastern Conference final for the second time in club history, however, they lost to the Hamilton Bulldogs.\n\n==Coaches==\nDuring the inaugural season of the [[Kingston Canadians]] in 1973\u201374, [[Jack Bownass]] was awarded the [[Matt Leyden Trophy]] as OHA Coach of the Year. Former NHL defenceman [[Jim Morrison (ice hockey)|Jim Morrison]] coached the team from 1975 to 1982, which was the longest stint a coach had when the club was known as the Canadians.\n\n[[Larry Mavety]] coached the Frontenacs for much of the team's history. He originally coached the team in 1988\u201389, when they were still known as the [[Kingston Raiders]]. In 1989\u201390, the first season the franchise was known as the Frontenacs, he won the [[Matt Leyden Trophy]] as the OHL Coach of the Year. Mavety returned to Kingston in 1997 to become the head coach once again, and stayed in that position until midway through the 2002\u201303 season when he stepped down to focus on his general manager duties. After a slow start in the 2007\u201308 season, Mavety once again found himself coaching the Frontenacs until November 2008. Mavety remained as the general manager until the end of the 2010\u201311 season.\n\nThe Frontenacs had head coaches that were also head coaches in the [[National Hockey League]], including [[Dave Allison]],  [[Gary Agnew]], and [[Bruce Cassidy]].\n\n===List of coaches===\n''(Multiple years in parentheses, totals include all incarnations of the Kingston franchise)''\n{|\n|-\n| valign=top width=40% |\n*'''1973\u201375''' [[Jack Bownass]] (2)\n*'''1975\u201382''' [[Jim Morrison (ice hockey)|Jim Morrison]] (7)\n*'''1982\u201383''' [[Rod Graham]]\n*'''1983\u201385''' Rick Cornacchia (2)\n*'''1985\u201385''' [[Jim Dorey]] (2)\n*'''1985\u201387''' [[Fred O'Donnell]] (2)\n*'''1987\u201388''' Jacques Tremblay\n*'''1988\u201388''' [[Jim Dorey]] (2)\n*'''1988\u201390''' [[Larry Mavety]] (10)\n*'''1990\u201391''' Randy Hall\n*'''1991\u201392''' Paul Cook\n*'''1992\u201394''' [[Dave Allison]] (2)\n| valign=top width=40% |\n*'''1994\u201397''' [[Gary Agnew]] (3)\n*'''1997\u20132003''' Larry Mavety (10)\n*'''2002\u201303''' Greg Bignell\n*'''2003\u201306''' [[Jim Hulton]] (3)\n*'''2006\u201307''' [[Bruce Cassidy]] (2)\n*'''2007\u201308''' Larry Mavety (10)\n*'''2008\u201311''' [[Doug Gilmour]] (3)\n*'''2011\u201314''' [[Todd Gill]] (3)\n*'''2014\u201317''' Paul McFarland (3)\n*'''2017\u201318''' Jay Varady<ref>{{cite web |url=http://kingstonfrontenacs.com/article/news-frontenacs-announce-jay-varady-as-head-coach |title=[NEWS] Frontenacs announce Jay Varady as Head Coach |publisher=Frontenacs |date=July 13, 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.nhl.com/coyotes/news/coyotes-name-varady-head-coach-of-tucson-roadrunners/c-299391598 |title=Coyotes Name Varady Head Coach of Tucson Roadrunners |publisher=[[Arizona Coyotes]] |date=July 2, 2018}}</ref>\n*'''2018\u2013present''' [[Kurtis Foster]]<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.oursportscentral.com/services/releases/kurtis-foster-promoted-to-head-coach-luca-caputi-named-as-associate-coach/n-5370244 |title=Kurtis Foster Promoted to Head Coach, Luca Caputi Named as Associate Coach |website=OurSportsCentral.com |date=July 16, 2018}}</ref>\n|}\n\n==Players==\n'''[[Paul Coffey]]''' is the only former member of the Kingston franchise to be inducted into the [[Hockey Hall of Fame]], getting the honour in 2004.

The logo featured a yellow letter 'K' with a black outline, surrounded by black spokes leading to a yellow circle border with the name Kingston Frontenacs in black.\n\nIn 2002, the team adopted a new logo with a stylized [[Louis de Buade de Frontenac|Count Frontenac]]. The jerseys feature a star striping pattern similar to Dallas of the NHL, and a modified version of the former \"K\" logo is used on the shoulder.\n\nIn 2007, the Frontenacs unveiled a 3rd jersey, which was black, yellow and white, and very similar looking to the [[Boston Bruins]] jerseys from the early 1970s. The \"K\" logo was used on the front of the jersey.  The Frontenacs began wearing these jerseys on February 22, 2008, which was the same night that they opened their new arena.\n\nIn 2008, The Frontenacs unveiled a new 3rd jersey which was worn at home between opening night and New Years barring 2 games where the black star jersey was worn. The {{sic|hide=yes|new jersey}} was a white version of the black alternate which was worn for the second half of the season.\n\nIn 2009, the Frontenacs, along with all CHL teams unveiled new uniforms using RBK EDGE templates. In 2012, the Frontenacs began wearing a newly designed set of uniforms featuring a large K as a logo.\n\n==Arenas==\nThe former home arena of the Frontenacs was the [[Kingston Memorial Centre]], with a [[seating capacity]] 3,079 seated, and 3,300 including standing room. Built in 1950, its ice size has unique dimensions of 200' x 92'. The Frontenacs' final game was played at the Memorial Center on February 15, 2008, a 6\u20134 win over the [[London Knights]]. Kyle Paige scored the final goal ever at the Memorial Centre.\n\nThe Kingston Frontenacs began play at their new downtown arena, the [[Rogers K-Rock Centre|Leon's Centre]] (then the K-Rock Centre) on February 22, 2008, in a 3\u20132 loss to the [[Belleville Bulls]]. The Frontenacs' first win at the Leon's Centre came on February 24, 2008 when they defeated the [[Peterborough Petes]] by a score of 7\u20134.\n\n==See also==\n*[[List of ice hockey teams in Ontario]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* {{official website|http://www.kingstonfrontenacs.com}}\n\n{{Kingston Frontenacs}}\n{{OHL}}\n{{OPJAHL}}\n{{Ontario Sports}}\n\n[[Category:Ice hockey clubs established in 1989]]\n[[Category:Ontario Hockey League teams]]\n[[Category:Sport in Kingston, Ontario]]\n[[Category:1989 establishments in Ontario]]\n", "name_user": "Frontsfan2005", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eList of coaches", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kingston_Frontenacs"}

[[Hernando de Soto]]'s troops were the first visitors to the area in 1540, and today a bridge stands where the Pensacola Trading Path crossed the Coosa River. A paved highway now traces the trail that was cut from [[Nashville, Tennessee|Nashville]] to Horseshoe Bend by [[Andrew Jackson]] on his way to fight the [[Muscogee|Creek]] [[Native Americans in the United States|Native Americans]] in what is now known as the [[Battle of Horseshoe Bend (1814)|Battle of Horseshoe Bend]].\n\nOriginally called \"Coosa Bend\", the area was later called \"Morgan's Cross Road\". It was located at the intersection of the Gadsden-Ashville Road and Gilbert's Ferry Road. The land was passed from Edmond Jones to his son Clayton, who never married. When he died, the land passed to his sister, Luvica Morgan, who was also the wife of William Morgan.\n\nKnowing the importance of education, John Sheffield Jones, the grandson of Edmond Jones, an original settler, donated $1,000 and the land for the construction of the first John S. Jones Elementary School. Later, John S. Jones burned to the ground and a new elementary school was built and serves the Rainbow City area today. \n\nOn Saturday, April 2, 1831, a church was organized at the Harmony Meeting House. Thomas Morgan served as the first pastor. A few years later, the first [[Baptist]] association was organized by Rev. John Gilliland. Harmony was one of the first five members in the association. The adjoining cemetery, Old Harmony Cemetery, has been declared a historic landmark. This cemetery has black and white slaves buried in it, Native Americans, single and double interment, and most of the tombstones have poems and writings on them. They say one man is buried crosswise because he lived crosswise with the world.\n\n==Education==\nThe city is served by the Etowah County Board of Education. The city has one public elementary school, and shares a middle and high school with neighboring Southside. There is also a private school for the city, Westbrook Christian School. Westbrook is a 3k-12 school. \n\n===John S. Jones Elementary===\nJohn S. Jones Elementary has been awarded an \"A\" on the state report card for the last two years. John S. Jones Elementary was awarded the National Blue Ribbon School Award in 2001. John S. Jones is also a CLAS Banner School of Distinction and A Bicentennial School. Students can join various school clubs and activities. The school started a recycling program to promote it throughout the community. The mission of John S. Jones Elementary is to develop competent, respectful, and resourceful students who pursue life-long learning.  We will accomplish this by providing a comprehensive, challenging, and diverse curriculum taught by enthusiastic, dedicated professionals in a safe, healthy, child-centered environment. \n\n===Rainbow Middle School===\nRainbow Middle School is the shared middle school for the area of Southside and Rainbow City. It houses grades 6-8. The mission of Rainbow Middle School is to assure the development of successful, caring, responsible students by providing a nurturing learning environment.\n\n===Southside High School===\nSouthside is the shared high school for the area of Southside and Rainbow City. It houses grades 9-12. The Southside mascot is a Panther. The mission of Southside High School is to make certain that each student realizes his or her own unique potential.  We strive to provide progressive instruction and a broad curriculum to ensure that all students meet state standards and are prepared for future challenges.  \n\n\n==Geography==\nRainbow City is located in southern Etowah County at {{coord|33|56|38|N|86|3|42|W|type:city}} (33.943964, -86.061546).<ref name=\"GR1\">{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/geographies/reference-files/time-series/geo/gazetteer-files.html|publisher=[[United States Census Bureau]]|accessdate=2011-04-23|date=2011-02-12|title=US Gazetteer files: 2010, 2000, and 1990}}</ref> It is bordered to the northeast by [[Gadsden, Alabama|Gadsden]], the [[county seat]], to the southeast by the [[Coosa River]], across which is the city of [[Southside, Alabama|Southside]], and to the southwest, across Little Canoe Creek, by the town of [[Steele, Alabama|Steele]] in [[St. Clair County, Alabama|St. Clair County]].\n\n[[U.S. Route 411]] (Rainbow Drive) is the main road through the city, leading northeast {{convert|6|mi|0}} to the center of Gadsden and southwest {{convert|15|mi}} to [[Ashville, Alabama|Ashville]].

[[Hernando de Soto]]'s troops were the first visitors to the area in 1540, and today a bridge stands where the Pensacola Trading Path crossed the Coosa River. A paved highway now traces the trail that was cut from [[Nashville, Tennessee|Nashville]] to Horseshoe Bend by [[Andrew Jackson]] on his way to fight the [[Muscogee|Creek]] [[Native Americans in the United States|Native Americans]] in what is now known as the [[Battle of Horseshoe Bend (1814)|Battle of Horseshoe Bend]].\n\nOriginally called \"Coosa Bend\", the area was later called \"Morgan's Cross Road\". It was located at the intersection of the Gadsden-Ashville Road and Gilbert's Ferry Road. The land was passed from Edmond Jones to his son Clayton, who never married. When he died, the land passed to his sister, Luvica Morgan, who was also the wife of William Morgan.\n\nKnowing the importance of education, John Sheffield Jones, the grandson of Edmond Jones, an original settler, donated $1,000 and the land for the construction of the first John S. Jones Elementary School. Later, John S. Jones burned to the ground and a new elementary school was built and serves the Rainbow City area today. \n\nOn Saturday, April 2, 1831, a church was organized at the Harmony Meeting House. Thomas Morgan served as the first pastor. A few years later, the first [[Baptist]] association was organized by Rev. John Gilliland. Harmony was one of the first five members in the association. The adjoining cemetery, Old Harmony Cemetery, has been declared a historic landmark. This cemetery has black and white slaves buried in it, Native Americans, single and double interment, and most of the tombstones have poems and writings on them. They say one man is buried crosswise because he lived crosswise with the world.\n\n==Education==\nThe city is served by the Etowah County Board of Education. The city has one public elementary school, and shares a middle and high school with neighboring Southside. There is also a private school for the city, Westbrook Christian School. Westbrook is a 3k-12 school. \n\n===John S. Jones Elementary===\nJohn S. Jones Elementary has been awarded an \"A\" on the state report card for the last two years. John S. Jones Elementary was awarded the National Blue Ribbon School Award in 2001. John S. Jones is also a CLAS Banner School of Distinction and A Bicentennial School. Students can join various school clubs and activities. The school started a recycling program to promote it throughout the community. The mission of John S. Jones Elementary is to develop competent, respectful, and resourceful students who pursue life-long learning.  We will accomplish this by providing a comprehensive, challenging, and diverse curriculum taught by enthusiastic, dedicated professionals in a safe, healthy, child-centered environment. \n\n===Rainbow Middle School===\nRainbow Middle School is the shared middle school for the area of Southside and Rainbow City. It houses grades 6-8. The mission of Rainbow Middle School is to assure the development of successful, caring, responsible students by providing a nurturing learning environment.\n\n===Southside High School===\nSouthside is the shared high school for the area of Southside and Rainbow City. It houses grades 9-12. The Southside mascot is a Panther. The mission of Southside High School is to make certain that each student realizes his or her own unique potential.  We strive to provide progressive instruction and a broad curriculum to ensure that all students meet state standards and are prepared for future challenges.  \n\n\n==Geography==\nRainbow City is located in southern Etowah County at {{coord|33|56|38|N|86|3|42|W|type:city}} (33.943964, -86.061546).<ref name=\"GR1\">{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/geographies/reference-files/time-series/geo/gazetteer-files.html|publisher=[[United States Census Bureau]]|accessdate=2011-04-23|date=2011-02-12|title=US Gazetteer files: 2010, 2000, and 1990}}</ref> It is bordered to the northeast by [[Gadsden, Alabama|Gadsden]], the [[county seat]], to the southeast by the [[Coosa River]], across which is the city of [[Southside, Alabama|Southside]], and to the southwest, across Little Canoe Creek, by the town of [[Steele, Alabama|Steele]] in [[St. Clair County, Alabama|St. Clair County]].\n\n[[U.S. Route 411]] (Rainbow Drive) is the main road through the city, leading northeast {{convert|6|mi|0}} to the center of Gadsden and southwest {{convert|15|mi}} to [[Ashville, Alabama|Ashville]].

Hall]] and performed by country singer [[Jeannie C. Riley]]. The film starred [[Barbara Eden]], [[Nanette Fabray]], [[Ronny Cox]], [[Louis Nye]] and [[Susan Swift]], directed by Richard Bennett and [[Ralph Senensky]] (who left the production during filming, and was replaced by Bennett), and primarily released to [[drive-in theater]]s throughout the summer of 1978. The film has a cult following in fans of the original song. The film's promotional [[tagline]] is: \"The song was scandalous. The movie is hilarious!\"\n\n==Plot==\nStella Johnson is a beautiful widowed single mother who lives in the town of Harper Valley, Ohio. She sells cosmetics door-to-door for the fictitious AngelGlo Cosmetics and is not afraid to enjoy life. Her fourteen-year-old daughter, Dee, is a student at Harper Valley Junior High School.\n\nAfter leaving school, Dee brings her mother a letter from the school's Parent Teacher Association board, which is led by the pompous and snobbish Flora Simpson-Reilly. The letter denounces her for her not following the societal mores of the day and the community and further stating that if she does not change her ways more to the board's liking, Dee will be punished for her mother's \"sins\" by being expelled from school.\n\nInfuriated by the board's supposed superiority and their glaring hypocrisy, Stella storms to the PTA meeting being held that day, and proceeds to tell most of the PTA members off by exposing their hidden skeletons for the town to see.\n\nAfter her house is TP'ed (Toilet-Papered) and a rock with a vile note attached is thrown through her window in retaliation, Stella prepares to get even with those who would want her driven out of town. She teams up with her friends, beautician Alice Finley and bartender Herbie Maddox, and (along with Dee's help) wreaks hilarious and justified revenge on six of the hypocritical PTA members, with methods including: (1) tricking a married male board member who has repeatedly tried to date Stella into a disastrous rendezvous, (2) embarrassing Mrs. Simpson-Reilly at one of her grand social gatherings, (3) exposing the secret antics of a supposedly prim-and-proper female board member/teacher, and (4) sending a herd of pink-painted elephants into the bedroom of an alcoholic board member.\n\nDuring the course of the movie, she finds out that one of the male PTA members, wealthy Willis Newton (who was not a party to the PTA letter), has fallen in love with her.\n\nWill and another male on the PTA board, Skeeter Duggan, the town's [[Notary public]], are sympathetic to Stella and do not agree with Flora and her cronies. After being informed by Will of the current PTA Board's incompetence and mismanagement and with his help, Stella is convinced to make a run for President of the PTA, a move which infuriates Flora and her allies.\n\nAfter a makeover, which sees her braces removed and her hair styled, Dee also finds a boyfriend in handsome Carlyle, a popular school track star, which incurs the jealousy of Bettina Reilly, the equally snobbish granddaughter of Flora. Also shown are Edwina, Bettina's identical twin sister who is just as snobbish as Bettina, and Dee's best friend Mavis.\n\n[[Real estate]] agent Kirby Baker, a member of the PTA Board, plans to ruin Stella by [[foreclosure|foreclosing]] on her house (which his company owns), but is arrested for assaulting Myrna Wong, an Asian-American martial arts expert helping Stella to set up the lecherous Baker. Now things become more and more desperate.\n\nThe board finally decide to resort to criminal means to maintain the power they hold, which is fast slipping away thanks to Stella's growing popularity. The board members then decide to hire a couple of kidnappers named Dutch and Tex to have Skeeter abducted so they can commit [[election fraud]].\n\nThe kidnappers snatch Skeeter as he is taking the trash out and take him in a nearby abbey, where he is imprisoned and made drunk on wine.\n\nOlive Glover, the PTA's Recording Secretary who has a hardcore [[gambling addiction]], has stolen money from the Milk Fund Rally, one of the PTA's numerous fund raisers, and intends to having Mavis framed for the crime and arrested. Leaving Dee to stall the PTA Board meeting, Stella and Alice follow Olive to a racing stable and recover the stolen money, some of which had been marked by Will.\n\nAs Stella and Alice race back to town, Will and Herbie spot the kidnappers and Skeeter outside the abbey from a helicopter and notify the girls. Disguised as nuns, Stella and Alice find Skeeter, free him and manage to escape with him after a wild car chase ending with the kidnappers crashing into a stream.\n\nUltimately, Flora's scheme to prevent Stella's nomination fails miserably: Olive, who would have been the swing vote against Stella, is arrested for embezzlement just as the PTA Board is about to vote against Stella's candidacy. Dutch and Tex, already in custody for the Skeeter Duggan kidnapping, tell the police that Flora was behind it all to keep Stella off the PTA Board.\n\nStella decisively wins the election and becomes the new PTA president, with the whole town voting to get rid of Flora and her snobbish friends. Will and Stella then fly off in his helicopter (which is trailing a sign saying \"Stella Johnson for Mayor\") to get married.\n\n==Cast and characters==\n* [[Barbara Eden]] as Stella Johnson, a widowed cosmetics salesperson with a young daughter, whose joie de vivre, her principles, and her individuality anger most of the powerful people in town and on the Parent Teachers Association board.  She inevitably becomes PTA president after embarrassing Flora, the snobby former President and her equally snobby friends.\n* [[Ronny Cox]] as Willis \"Will\" Newton, a wealthy member of the PTA who doesn't agree with Flora and her snobby allies and is in love with Stella. He and Stella get married at the end of the movie.\n* [[Nanette Fabray]] as Alice Finley, Stella's best friend and co-conspirator against the snobs of Harper Valley. She owns and operates the La Moderne Beauty Shop.\n* [[Louis Nye]] as Kirby Baker, a local real estate agent who is allied with Flora and her friends. Notorious for being a lecherous playboy and infamous for impregnating his secretaries, one of whom, Gladys Wilmot, left town to see an abortionist in Cincinnati. As part of a plan to discredit Stella, he tries to foreclose on Stella's house, which infuriates her. He then gets arrested and jailed for attacking Myrna Wong, a friend of Stella's, who rebuffs his advances, throwing him by use of martial arts and destroying the office.\n* [[John Fiedler]] as Bobby Taylor, a man on the PTA who lusts after Stella. Overly dominated by his wife, Holly. Although open to allow Stella to speak, he is not above having a fellow PTA board member kidnapped to commit election fraud. He was arrested for [[indecent exposure]] after being set up by Stella.\n* [[Ron Masak]] as Herbie Maddox, the head bartender at Kelly's bar, and Stella's ally against Flora and her friends. He has a crush on Stella, and is one of her friends.\n* [[Clint Howard]] as Corley, a young delivery person, who works for the local florist shop, who brings Stella flowers from Will.\n* [[Susan Swift]] as Dee Johnson, Stella's 14-year-old daughter, who is threatened with expulsion from school if her mother doesn't conform to the way the PTA wants her to behave. She has a hand in assisting her mother and Alice with one of their revenge schemes. She loses her braces, gets a makeover, and ends up with a boyfriend, Carlyle.\n* [[Pat Paulsen]] as Otis Harper, the descendant of the founding family of Harper Valley. A PTA member who is allied with Flora and her friends. Has a tendency to drink all the time, which annoys his wife, Bertha. He had a stampede of elephants, painted pink, stormed through his house, destroying it.\n* [[Amzie Strickland]] as Shirley Thompson, a member of the PTA board who tends to drink a lot of gin. Though she is allied with Flora and her friends, she is one of four PTA members (Will, Skeeter and Holly Taylor are the others) who are spared any retribution from Stella. She was seen as the most sympathetic of the board, as she tended to be more ''manipulated'' as opposed to being manipulative. It was never revealed whether or not she retained her seat on the PTA, but it is presumed that she became more sympathetic towards Stella as she was seen waving goodbye at Olive as she was being arrested.\n* [[Bob Hastings]] as Skeeter Duggan, a member of the PTA board, and the town's [[Notary public]] who is sympathetic to Stella. He is kidnapped by Dutch and Tex at Flora Simpson Reilly's orders.\n* [[Audrey Christie]] as Flora Simpson-Reilly, The movie's main antagonist. She is the pompous and extremely snobbish president of the PTA board who thoroughly despises Stella (who defeats her for president at the end of the movie) and all she stands for. So desperate is she to retain her power and prestige in the community that she has a fellow member of the PTA (Skeeter Duggan) kidnapped so she and her allies can commit election fraud. She is embarrassed when her permanent set is destroyed by a hair depilatory at the beauty salon.\n* [[Molly Dodd]] as Olive Glover, the recording secretary of the PTA who is a gambling addict. Clearly the most corrupt and most vindictive member of the PTA board, she is eventually arrested for embezzlement after having a load of hay and horse manure dumped on top of her. She is the one who initially angers Stella by sending her the letter denouncing her, and tries to get Dee's friend, Mavis, arrested for embezzlement.\n* Fay DeWitt as Willamae Jones, a snide biology teacher at the junior high school who is also a member of the PTA. She makes no secret of the fact that she favors the Reilly twins, due to the connections between her and Flora. Notorious for being a nymphomaniac (though she hides it under a prim-and-proper fa\u00e7ade), she is caught ''in flagrante delicto'' with Barney Crunk, the town's mailman, on film.\n* DeVera Marcus as Holly Taylor, Bobby's obviously overbearing wife, who tends to drink a lot when Bobby is out of town, and doesn't approve of Bobby's lusting, or of anything else he does (this is different from the character in the song, who \"seems to use a lot of ice whenever [her husband]'s away\", implying adultery with the iceman). However, despite her ties to Flora and her scheming friends, she, like Shirley Thompson, is spared any retribution from Stella, due to Stella refusing to date Bobby.\n* Louise Foley as Mavis, Dee Johnson's best friend, who is nearly framed for a crime she did not commit by the vindictive Olive Glover.\n* Brian Cook as Carlyle, a popular track star who chooses Dee, after she gets a makeover, and angers Bettina Reilly in the process.\n* Laura Teige as Bettina Reilly, One of Flora's twin granddaughters, who wants to be with Carlyle, and is jealous when he chooses Dee over her. She tends to be as snotty as her grandmother.\n* Jan Teige as Edwina Reilly, Bettina's twin sister, who is just as snotty.\n* Irene Yah-Ling Sun as Myrna Wong, a friend of Stella's who is a [[judo]] expert; she is assaulted by Kirby Baker, destroys him and his office in retaliation, and has him sent to jail for assault.\n* Tobias Anderson as \"Cranky\" Barney Crunk, the town's nosy mailman who had the bad habit of peeking in everyone's mail. He is caught ''in flagrante delicto'' on film with Willamae Jones.\n* [[Royce D. Applegate]] as Dutch, one of two kidnappers who abduct Skeeter Duggan at Flora Simpson-Reilly's orders.\n* J. J. Barry as Tex, the mastermind of the kidnap plot to get Skeeter Duggan out of the way so Flora Simpson-Reilly and her friends could commit election fraud. He and his accomplice Dutch are arrested and the two of them rat out Flora and her friends on their scheme.\n* Pitt Herbert as Henry Reilly, Flora's overly dominated husband and grandfather to Edwina and Bettina.

Hall]] and performed by country singer [[Jeannie C. Riley]]. The film starred [[Barbara Eden]], [[Nanette Fabray]], [[Ronny Cox]], [[Louis Nye]] and [[Susan Swift]], directed by Richard Bennett and [[Ralph Senensky]] (who left the production during filming, and was replaced by Bennett), and primarily released to [[drive-in theater]]s throughout the summer of 1978. The film has a cult following in fans of the original song. The film's promotional [[tagline]] is: \"The song was scandalous. The movie is hilarious!\"\n\n==Plot==\nStella Johnson is a beautiful widowed single mother who lives in the town of Harper Valley, Ohio. She sells cosmetics door-to-door for the fictitious AngelGlo Cosmetics and is not afraid to enjoy life. Her fourteen-year-old daughter, Dee, is a student at Harper Valley Junior High School.\n\nAfter leaving school, Dee brings her mother a letter from the school's Parent Teacher Association board, which is led by the pompous and snobbish Flora Simpson-Reilly. The letter denounces her for her not following the societal mores of the day and the community and further stating that if she does not change her ways more to the board's liking, Dee will be punished for her mother's \"sins\" by being expelled from school.\n\nInfuriated by the board's supposed superiority and their glaring hypocrisy, Stella storms to the PTA meeting being held that day, and proceeds to tell most of the PTA members off by exposing their hidden skeletons for the town to see.\n\nAfter her house is TP'ed (Toilet-Papered) and a rock with a vile note attached is thrown through her window in retaliation, Stella prepares to get even with those who would want her driven out of town. She teams up with her friends, beautician Alice Finley and bartender Herbie Maddox, and (along with Dee's help) wreaks hilarious and justified revenge on six of the hypocritical PTA members, with methods including: (1) tricking a married male board member who has repeatedly tried to date Stella into a disastrous rendezvous, (2) embarrassing Mrs. Simpson-Reilly at one of her grand social gatherings, (3) exposing the secret antics of a supposedly prim-and-proper female board member/teacher, and (4) sending a herd of pink-painted elephants into the bedroom of an alcoholic board member.\n\nDuring the course of the movie, she finds out that one of the male PTA members, wealthy Willis Newton (who was not a party to the PTA letter), has fallen in love with her.\n\nWill and another male on the PTA board, Skeeter Duggan, the town's [[Notary public]], are sympathetic to Stella and do not agree with Flora and her cronies. After being informed by Will of the current PTA Board's incompetence and mismanagement and with his help, Stella is convinced to make a run for President of the PTA, a move which infuriates Flora and her allies.\n\nAfter a makeover, which sees her braces removed and her hair styled, Dee also finds a boyfriend in handsome Carlyle, a popular school track star, which incurs the jealousy of Bettina Reilly, the equally snobbish granddaughter of Flora. Also shown are Edwina, Bettina's identical twin sister who is just as snobbish as Bettina, and Dee's best friend Mavis.\n\n[[Real estate]] agent Kirby Baker, a member of the PTA Board, plans to ruin Stella by [[foreclosure|foreclosing]] on her house (which his company owns), but is arrested for assaulting Myrna Wong, an Asian-American martial arts expert helping Stella to set up the lecherous Baker. Now things become more and more desperate.\n\nThe board finally decide to resort to criminal means to maintain the power they hold, which is fast slipping away thanks to Stella's growing popularity. The board members then decide to hire a couple of kidnappers named Dutch and Tex to have Skeeter abducted so they can commit [[election fraud]].\n\nThe kidnappers snatch Skeeter as he is taking the trash out and take him in a nearby abbey, where he is imprisoned and made drunk on wine.\n\nOlive Glover, the PTA's Recording Secretary who has a hardcore [[gambling addiction]], has stolen money from the Milk Fund Rally, one of the PTA's numerous fund raisers, and intends to having Mavis framed for the crime and arrested. Leaving Dee to stall the PTA Board meeting, Stella and Alice follow Olive to a racing stable and recover the stolen money, some of which had been marked by Will.\n\nAs Stella and Alice race back to town, Will and Herbie spot the kidnappers and Skeeter outside the abbey from a helicopter and notify the girls. Disguised as nuns, Stella and Alice find Skeeter, free him and manage to escape with him after a wild car chase ending with the kidnappers crashing into a stream.\n\nUltimately, Flora's scheme to prevent Stella's nomination fails miserably: Olive, who would have been the swing vote against Stella, is arrested for embezzlement just as the PTA Board is about to vote against Stella's candidacy. Dutch and Tex, already in custody for the Skeeter Duggan kidnapping, tell the police that Flora was behind it all to keep Stella off the PTA Board.\n\nStella decisively wins the election and becomes the new PTA president, with the whole town voting to get rid of Flora and her snobbish friends. Will and Stella then fly off in his helicopter (which is trailing a sign saying \"Stella Johnson for Mayor\") to get married.\n\n==Cast and characters==\n* [[Barbara Eden]] as Stella Johnson, a widowed cosmetics salesperson with a young daughter, whose joie de vivre, her principles, and her individuality anger most of the powerful people in town and on the Parent Teachers Association board.  She inevitably becomes PTA president after embarrassing Flora, the snobby former President and her equally snobby friends.\n* [[Ronny Cox]] as Willis \"Will\" Newton, a wealthy member of the PTA who doesn't agree with Flora and her snobby allies and is in love with Stella. He and Stella get married at the end of the movie.\n* [[Nanette Fabray]] as Alice Finley, Stella's best friend and co-conspirator against the snobs of Harper Valley. She owns and operates the La Moderne Beauty Shop.\n* [[Louis Nye]] as Kirby Baker, a local real estate agent who is allied with Flora and her friends. Notorious for being a lecherous playboy and infamous for impregnating his secretaries, one of whom, Gladys Wilmot, left town to see an abortionist in Cincinnati. As part of a plan to discredit Stella, he tries to foreclose on Stella's house, which infuriates her. He then gets arrested and jailed for attacking Myrna Wong, a friend of Stella's, who rebuffs his advances, throwing him by use of martial arts and destroying the office.\n* [[John Fiedler]] as Bobby Taylor, a man on the PTA who lusts after Stella. Overly dominated by his wife, Holly. Although open to allow Stella to speak, he is not above having a fellow PTA board member kidnapped to commit election fraud. He was arrested for [[indecent exposure]] after being set up by Stella.\n* [[Ron Masak]] as Herbie Maddox, the head bartender at Kelly's bar, and Stella's ally against Flora and her friends. He has a crush on Stella, and is one of her friends.\n* [[Clint Howard]] as Corley, a young delivery person, who works for the local florist shop, who brings Stella flowers from Will.\n* [[Susan Swift]] as Dee Johnson, Stella's 14-year-old daughter, who is threatened with expulsion from school if her mother doesn't conform to the way the PTA wants her to behave. She has a hand in assisting her mother and Alice with one of their revenge schemes. She loses her braces, gets a makeover, and ends up with a boyfriend, Carlyle.\n* [[Pat Paulsen]] as Otis Harper, the descendant of the founding family of Harper Valley. A PTA member who is allied with Flora and her friends. Has a tendency to drink all the time, which annoys his wife, Bertha. He had a stampede of elephants, painted pink, stormed through his house, destroying it.\n* [[Amzie Strickland]] as Shirley Thompson, a member of the PTA board who tends to drink a lot of gin. Though she is allied with Flora and her friends, she is one of four PTA members (Will, Skeeter and Holly Taylor are the others) who are spared any retribution from Stella. She was seen as the most sympathetic of the board, as she tended to be more ''manipulated'' as opposed to being manipulative. It was never revealed whether or not she retained her seat on the PTA, but it is presumed that she became more sympathetic towards Stella as she was seen waving goodbye at Olive as she was being arrested.\n* [[Bob Hastings]] as Skeeter Duggan, a member of the PTA board, and the town's [[Notary public]] who is sympathetic to Stella. He is kidnapped by Dutch and Tex at Flora Simpson Reilly's orders.\n* [[Audrey Christie]] as Flora Simpson-Reilly, The movie's main antagonist. She is the pompous and extremely snobbish president of the PTA board who thoroughly despises Stella (who defeats her for president at the end of the movie) and all she stands for. So desperate is she to retain her power and prestige in the community that she has a fellow member of the PTA (Skeeter Duggan) kidnapped so she and her allies can commit election fraud. She is embarrassed when her permanent set is destroyed by a hair depilatory at the beauty salon.\n* [[Molly Dodd]] as Olive Glover, the recording secretary of the PTA who is a gambling addict. Clearly the most corrupt and most vindictive member of the PTA board, she is eventually arrested for embezzlement after having a load of hay and horse manure dumped on top of her. She is the one who initially angers Stella by sending her the letter denouncing her, and tries to get Dee's friend, Mavis, arrested for embezzlement.\n* Fay DeWitt as Willamae Jones, a snide biology teacher at the junior high school who is also a member of the PTA. She makes no secret of the fact that she favors the Reilly twins, due to the connections between her and Flora. Notorious for being a nymphomaniac (though she hides it under a prim-and-proper fa\u00e7ade), she is caught ''in flagrante delicto'' with Barney Crunk, the town's mailman, on film.\n* DeVera Marcus as Holly Taylor, Bobby's obviously overbearing wife, who tends to drink a lot when Bobby is out of town, and doesn't approve of Bobby's lusting, or of anything else he does (this is different from the character in the song, who \"seems to use a lot of ice whenever [her husband]'s away\", implying adultery with the iceman). However, despite her ties to Flora and her scheming friends, she, like Shirley Thompson, is spared any retribution from Stella, due to Stella refusing to date Bobby.\n* Louise Foley as Mavis, Dee Johnson's best friend, who is nearly framed for a crime she did not commit by the vindictive Olive Glover.\n* Brian Cook as Carlyle, a popular track star who chooses Dee, after she gets a makeover, and angers Bettina Reilly in the process.\n* Laura Teige as Bettina Reilly, One of Flora's twin granddaughters, who wants to be with Carlyle, and is jealous when he chooses Dee over her. She tends to be as snotty as her grandmother.\n* Jan Teige as Edwina Reilly, Bettina's twin sister, who is just as snotty.\n* Irene Yah-Ling Sun as Myrna Wong, a friend of Stella's who is a [[judo]] expert; she is assaulted by Kirby Baker, destroys him and his office in retaliation, and has him sent to jail for assault.\n* Tobias Anderson as \"Cranky\" Barney Crunk, the town's nosy mailman who had the bad habit of peeking in everyone's mail. He is caught ''in flagrante delicto'' on film with Willamae Jones.\n* [[Royce D. Applegate]] as Dutch, one of two kidnappers who abduct Skeeter Duggan at Flora Simpson-Reilly's orders.\n* J. J. Barry as Tex, the mastermind of the kidnap plot to get Skeeter Duggan out of the way so Flora Simpson-Reilly and her friends could commit election fraud. He and his accomplice Dutch are arrested and the two of them rat out Flora and her friends on their scheme.\n* Pitt Herbert as Henry Reilly, Flora's overly dominated husband and grandfather to Edwina and Bettina. Henry is wealthy, but is very weak-willed and is known for acquiescing to his wife's schemes.\n* Arlen Stuart as Bertha Harper, wife of Otis Harper, who gets annoyed by her husband's continual drinking. She is terrified when her house is destroyed by pink-painted elephants.\n* [[Woody Harrelson]] as an extra.
