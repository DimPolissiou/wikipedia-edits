Because the Russian-made Kornet is an accurate, laser-guided weapon, it appeared that the bus was intentionally targeted. The attackers were never apprehended.

Israel said the yellow color of the bus made it easily identifiable and accused Hamas of \"crossing a line. The missile hit the bus after all but one of the children had been dropped off.

The suspect then shot the man and a child. An ambulance took the man to John Peter Smith Hospital, while the 10-year-old was taken to Cook Children's Hospital in a private vehicle. The boy was expected to undergo surgery, possibly to retrieve a projectile. The game was not a school-sponsored event. The shooting also did not involve any  students.

A second strategy, subunit vaccines, aims to create a vaccine that sensitises the immune system to certain subunits of the virus. In the case of SARS-CoV-2, such research focuses on the S-spike protein that helps the virus intrude the [[ACE2 enzyme]] receptor. A third strategy is that of the nucleic acid vaccines ([[DNA vaccination|DNA]] or [[RNA vaccines]], a novel technique for creating a vaccination).

A second strategy, subunit vaccines, aims to create a vaccine that sensitises the immune system to certain subunits of the virus. In the case of SARS-CoV-2, such research focuses on the S-spike protein that helps the virus intrude the [[ACE2 enzyme]] receptor. A third strategy is that of the nucleic acid vaccines ([[DNA vaccination|DNA]] or [[RNA vaccines]], a novel technique for creating a vaccination).

[[Central Europe|Central]] and [[Western Europe]]. Covering an area of {{convert|357022|km2|sqmi}}, it lies between the [[Baltic Sea|Baltic]] and [[North Sea|North]] seas to the north, and the [[Alps]] to the south. It borders [[Denmark]] to the north, [[Poland]] and the [[Czech Republic]] to the east, [[Austria]] and [[Switzerland]] to the south, and [[France]], [[Luxembourg]], [[Belgium]], and the [[Netherlands]] to the west.\n\nVarious [[Germanic tribes]] have inhabited the northern parts of modern Germany since [[classical antiquity]]. A region named [[Germania]] was documented before AD 100. Beginning in the 10th century, German territories formed a central part of the [[Holy Roman Empire]]. During the 16th century, [[Northern Germany|northern German regions]] became the centre of the [[Protestant Reformation]]. After the collapse of the Holy Roman Empire, the [[German Confederation]] was formed in 1815. In 1871, Germany became a nation state when [[unification of Germany|most of the German states unified]] into the [[Prussia]]n-dominated [[German Empire]]. After World War I and the [[German Revolution of 1918\u201319|revolution of 1918\u201319]], the Empire was replaced by the parliamentary [[Weimar Republic]]. The [[Nazi seizure of power]] in 1933 led to the establishment of [[Nazi Germany|a dictatorship]], World War II, and the [[Holocaust]]. After the end of World War II in Europe and a period of [[Allied-occupied Germany|Allied occupation]], two new German states were founded: [[West Germany]] and [[East Germany]]. The Federal Republic of Germany was a founding member of the [[European Economic Community]] and the European Union.

Its capital and largest city is [[Berlin]], and its financial centre is [[Frankfurt]]; the largest urban area is the [[Ruhr]].\n\nGermany is a [[great power]] with [[Economy of Germany|a strong economy]]; it has the [[List of sovereign states in Europe by GDP (nominal)|largest economy in Europe]], the world's [[List of countries by GDP (nominal)|fourth-largest economy by nominal GDP]], and the [[List of countries by GDP (PPP)|fifth-largest by PPP]].

[[Central Europe|Central]] and [[Western Europe]]. Covering an area of {{convert|357022|km2|sqmi}}, it lies between the [[Baltic Sea|Baltic]] and [[North Sea|North]] seas to the north, and the [[Alps]] to the south. It borders [[Denmark]] to the north, [[Poland]] and the [[Czech Republic]] to the east, [[Austria]] and [[Switzerland]] to the south, and [[France]], [[Luxembourg]], [[Belgium]], and the [[Netherlands]] to the west.\n\nVarious [[Germanic tribes]] have inhabited the northern parts of modern Germany since [[classical antiquity]]. A region named [[Germania]] was documented before AD 100. Beginning in the 10th century, German territories formed a central part of the [[Holy Roman Empire]]. During the 16th century, [[Northern Germany|northern German regions]] became the centre of the [[Protestant Reformation]]. After the collapse of the Holy Roman Empire, the [[German Confederation]] was formed in 1815. In 1871, Germany became a nation state when [[unification of Germany|most of the German states unified]] into the [[Prussia]]n-dominated [[German Empire]]. After World War I and the [[German Revolution of 1918\u201319|revolution of 1918\u201319]], the Empire was replaced by the parliamentary [[Weimar Republic]]. The [[Nazi seizure of power]] in 1933 led to the establishment of [[Nazi Germany|a dictatorship]], World War II, and the [[Holocaust]]. After the end of World War II in Europe and a period of [[Allied-occupied Germany|Allied occupation]], two new German states were founded: [[West Germany]] and [[East Germany]]. The Federal Republic of Germany was a founding member of the [[European Economic Community]] and the European Union. The country [[German reunification|was reunified]] on [[German Unity Day|3 October 1990]].\n\nToday, Germany is a [[Federalism|federal]] [[Parliamentary system|parliamentary]] [[republic]] led by a [[Chancellor of Germany (Federal Republic of Germany)|chancellor]]. With 83 million inhabitants of its 16 [[States of Germany|constituent states]], it is the [[List of European countries by population|second-most populous]] country in Europe after [[Russia]], as well as the most populous [[member state of the European Union|member state]] of the [[European Union]]. Its capital and largest city is [[Berlin]], and its financial centre is [[Frankfurt]]; the largest urban area is the [[Ruhr]].\n\nGermany is a [[great power]] with [[Economy of Germany|a strong economy]]; it has the [[List of sovereign states in Europe by GDP (nominal)|largest economy in Europe]], the world's [[List of countries by GDP (nominal)|fourth-largest economy by nominal GDP]], and the [[List of countries by GDP (PPP)|fifth-largest by PPP]]. As a global leader in several industrial and technological sectors, it is both the world's [[List of countries by exports|third-largest exporter]] and [[List of countries by imports|importer]] of goods. A [[Developed country|highly developed country]] with a [[List of countries by Human Development Index|very high standard of living]], it offers [[Social security in Germany|social security]] and a [[Healthcare in Germany|universal health care]] system, environmental protections, and a [[Higher education in Germany|tuition-free university education]]. Germany is also a member of the [[United Nations]], [[NATO]], the [[G7]], the [[G20]], and the [[OECD]].

It is in [[Northumberland County, Ontario|Northumberland County]], in the township of [[Alnwick/Haldimand]]. It is 12&nbsp;km east of [[Cobourg, Ontario]] on the former [[Highway 2 (Ontario)|Highway 2]] (now County Road 2), with close access to [[Highway 401 (Ontario)|Highway 401]]. The hamlet is near the geographically significant [[Oak Ridges Moraine]] at [[Rice Lake (Ontario)|Rice Lake]]. Grafton was originally called Grover's Tavern until March, 1832. The original Grover's Tavern, the namesake building of the hamlet, still stands today as the Grafton Village Inn, a restaurant and B & B in the heart of the hamlet. It was also referred to early in its history as Haldimand, which is the name of the township it is located in.\n\nGrafton is an excellent example of the type of hamlets that flourished in the 19th century. Grafton had a bustling port for many years, shipping grain, barley and other commodities to communities along the Great Lakes. In addition, the hamlet included a [[Sons of Temperance]] group, an order of Freemasons, and numerous other social leagues. Bolstered by satellite communities such as [[Centreton, Ontario|Centreton]], [[Castleton, Ontario|Castleton]], Wicklow, and Vernonville, Grafton was a productive hamlet that supported itself through both agriculture and services.\n\nBy the late 1870s the hamlet could boast of having a doctor, several taverns and inns, a cheese factory, a blacksmith, a public scale, and a train station on the G.T.R line. Milk and dairy products were shipped daily to both [[Kingston, Ontario|Kingston]] and [[Toronto]], and regular passenger service was also available. Grafton was successful enough at this time to earn a weekly column in the Cobourg daily newspaper, entitled \"Latest Items from Grafton\", which ran from 1875 through 1877. The column included news of the surrounding communities and hamlets and detailed various social, political, and economic on-goings in the area, such as picnics, local crime, sporting contests, and harvest reports.\n\n[[Benjamin Ewing]] is believed to be one of the first settlers in Grafton, and his property was located on what is currently Benlock road. Another early settler was Eliakim Barnum, the original owner of the [[Barnum house|Barnum House]]  on Hwy #2. [[Barnum house|Barnum House]] is now a museum in Grafton, and it is thought that Eliakim Barnum bought the house from another family who owned it before. Ben Ewing and Eliakim Barnum were good friends and Barnum married Ben's sister Hannah Ewing Blanchard just after 1812. The Original Barnum house was accidentally burned down during the [[War of 1812]] by British soldiers who were billeting there; it was rebuilt a few years later. This building is a historical site in Ontario and has visiting hours in the summer (Wednesday to Sunday, 10:00 am \u2013 4:00 pm).\n\nThe town of Grafton currently has a small population of under one thousand, but it has considerable history. Many early settlers continue to have descendants living in the area; notable family names include Calnan, McBride, Johnston, Inglis, Harnden, Harrison, Raymond, Owens, Davis, Bryden, Broomfield, Chamberlain, Lackey, Lawless, Bryson and others. Many of these early settler families have routes, roads, and landmarks named for them in the hamlets and surrounding areas, such as Broomfield Road, which runs roughly between Vernonville and Centreton.\n\nSome current businesses and community buildings include the Haldimand Memorial Arena, the Grafton Community Centre & Library, Grafton Public School, St. Marys Elementary School, Grafton Variety, Prentice's Garage, The Durham Farmers Co-op farm and feed store, the Bullpen, 1812 Antiques, Lantern Books, the Grafton Village Inn, and the Lawless Art Gallery. Grafton is currently home to such notable places as St. Annes Inn & Spa, the former home of [[Bob Homme]] (\"The Friendly Giant\"), the [[Barnum house|Barnum House]] museum, and a defunct canning factory (since converted into a private residence<ref>https://www.azuremagazine.com/article/from-cannery-to-rustic-home/</ref>).\n\nGrafton is now supported by these smaller businesses and tourism. Agriculture is still prevalent in the surrounding area, predominantly with crops such as corn, soybeans, and wheat, and livestock including beef, dairy, and poultry. The processing and shipping elements of the agricultural business have moved on beyond Grafton. There continues to be development and residential growth in and around the hamlet as the area grows in size.\n\nGrafton is the current site where Kirkland Signature brand (Costco) sources their spring water (sold in stores across the province). Also the source for water for the RealCanadian water bottle company.\n\nGrafton is home to the HBK\u2014a Ukrainian Boy Scout\u2019s fraternity characterized by their passion \u2018for the kids\u2019. Since their inception, HBK has tirelessly volunteered their time to create and improve the experiences of children at summer camp. HBK also organizes an annual baseball game that realizes members of the fraternity sliding, jumping and engaging in healthy camaraderie. HBK\u2019s passions extend beyond kids and sport, with a rooted interest in fantasy games including, Excaliball. Yonkatora Evans is chief of the HBK.\n\nGrafton has an active community facebook group.\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n{{Commons category-inline}}\n\n{{Geographic location\n|Centre = Grafton, Ontario\n|North = [[Centreton, Ontario|Centreton]]<br /><small>''[[Northumberland County Road 23]]''</small>\n|Northwest = [[Cobourg, Ontario|Cobourg]]<br /><small>''[[Ontario Highway 401|Highway 401]]''</small>\n|Northeast = [[Vernonville, Ontario|Vernonville]]<br /><small>''[[Ontario Highway 2|Northumberland County Road 2]] (formerly [[Ontario Highway 2|Highway 2]])'', ''[[Northumberland County Road 23]]''</small>\n|West = [[Cobourg, Ontario|Cobourg]]<br /><small>''[[Ontario Highway 2|Northumberland County Road 2]] (formerly [[Ontario Highway 2|Highway 2]])''</small>\n|East = [[Wicklow, Ontario|Wicklow]], [[Colborne, Ontario|Colborne]]<br /><small>''[[Ontario Highway 2|Northumberland County Road 2]] (formerly [[Ontario Highway 2|Highway 2]])'', ''[[Ontario Highway 401|Highway 401]]''</small>\n|South = ''[[Lake Ontario]]''\n}} \n{{coord|43.99109|N|78.02387|W|source:placeopedia|display=title}}\n\n{{authority control}}\n\n[[Category:Communities in Northumberland County, Ontario]]\n", "text_old": "{{more citations needed|date=June 2019}}\n[[File:Grafton ON.JPG|thumb|right|270px|Grafton]]\n'''Grafton''' is a community in the  [[Canadian province|province]] of [[Ontario]].

Milk and dairy products were shipped daily to both [[Kingston, Ontario|Kingston]] and [[Toronto]], and regular passenger service was also available. Grafton was successful enough at this time to earn a weekly column in the Cobourg daily newspaper, entitled \"Latest Items from Grafton\", which ran from 1875 through 1877. The column included news of the surrounding communities and hamlets and detailed various social, political, and economic on-goings in the area, such as picnics, local crime, sporting contests, and harvest reports.\n\n[[Benjamin Ewing]] is believed to be one of the first settlers in Grafton, and his property was located on what is currently Benlock road. Another early settler was Eliakim Barnum, the original owner of the [[Barnum house|Barnum House]]  on Hwy #2. [[Barnum house|Barnum House]] is now a museum in Grafton, and it is thought that Eliakim Barnum bought the house from another family who owned it before. Ben Ewing and Eliakim Barnum were good friends and Barnum married Ben's sister Hannah Ewing Blanchard just after 1812. The Original Barnum house was accidentally burned down during the [[War of 1812]] by British soldiers who were billeting there; it was rebuilt a few years later. This building is a historical site in Ontario and has visiting hours in the summer (Wednesday to Sunday, 10:00 am \u2013 4:00 pm).\n\nThe town of Grafton currently has a small population of under one thousand, but it has considerable history. Many early settlers continue to have descendants living in the area; notable family names include Calnan, McBride, Johnston, Inglis, Harnden, Harrison, Raymond, Owens, Davis, Bryden, Broomfield, Chamberlain, Lackey, Lawless, Bryson and others. Many of these early settler families have routes, roads, and landmarks named for them in the hamlets and surrounding areas, such as Broomfield Road, which runs roughly between Vernonville and Centreton.\n\nSome current businesses and community buildings include the Haldimand Memorial Arena, the Grafton Community Centre & Library, Grafton Public School, St. Marys Elementary School, Grafton Variety, Prentice's Garage, The Durham Farmers Co-op farm and feed store, the Bullpen, 1812 Antiques, Lantern Books, the Grafton Village Inn, and the Lawless Art Gallery. Grafton is currently home to such notable places as St. Annes Inn & Spa, the former home of [[Bob Homme]] (\"The Friendly Giant\"), the [[Barnum house|Barnum House]] museum, and a defunct canning factory (since converted into a private residence<ref>https://www.azuremagazine.com/article/from-cannery-to-rustic-home/</ref>).\n\nGrafton is now supported by these smaller businesses and tourism. Agriculture is still prevalent in the surrounding area, predominantly with crops such as corn, soybeans, and wheat, and livestock including beef, dairy, and poultry. The processing and shipping elements of the agricultural business have moved on beyond Grafton. There continues to be development and residential growth in and around the hamlet as the area grows in size.\n\nGrafton is the current site where Kirkland Signature brand (Costco) sources their spring water (sold in stores across the province). Also the source for water for the RealCanadian water bottle company.\n\nGrafton is home to the HBK\u2014a Ukrainian Boy Scout\u2019s fraternity characterized by their passion \u2018for the kids\u2019. Since their inception, HBK has tirelessly volunteered their time to create and improve the experiences of children at summer camp. HBK also organizes an annual baseball game that realizes members of the fraternity sliding, jumping and engaging in healthy camaraderie. HBK\u2019s passions extend beyond kids and sport, with a rooted interest in fantasy games including, Excaliball. Yonkatora Evans is chief of the HBK.\n\nGrafton has an active community facebook group.\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n{{Commons category-inline}}\n\n{{Geographic location\n|Centre = Grafton, Ontario\n|North = [[Centreton, Ontario|Centreton]]<br /><small>''[[Northumberland County Road 23]]''</small>\n|Northwest = [[Cobourg, Ontario|Cobourg]]<br /><small>''[[Ontario Highway 401|Highway 401]]''</small>\n|Northeast = [[Vernonville, Ontario|Vernonville]]<br /><small>''[[Ontario Highway 2|Northumberland County Road 2]] (formerly [[Ontario Highway 2|Highway 2]])'', ''[[Northumberland County Road 23]]''</small>\n|West = [[Cobourg, Ontario|Cobourg]]<br /><small>''[[Ontario Highway 2|Northumberland County Road 2]] (formerly [[Ontario Highway 2|Highway 2]])''</small>\n|East = [[Wicklow, Ontario|Wicklow]], [[Colborne, Ontario|Colborne]]<br /><small>''[[Ontario Highway 2|Northumberland County Road 2]] (formerly [[Ontario Highway 2|Highway 2]])'', ''[[Ontario Highway 401|Highway 401]]''</small>\n|South = ''[[Lake Ontario]]''\n}} \n{{coord|43.99109|N|78.02387|W|source:placeopedia|display=title}}\n\n{{authority control}}\n\n[[Category:Communities in Northumberland County, Ontario]]\n", "name_user": "Gromte", "label": "safe", "comment": "linked sons of temperance", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grafton,_Ontario"}

This aircraft is now in Virgin Australia livery.]]\nThe timing of Virgin Blue's entry into the Australian market was fortunate as it was able to fill the vacuum created by the failure of [[Ansett Australia]] in September 2001. Ansett's failure allowed Virgin to grow rapidly to become Australia's second domestic carrier, rather than staying just a cut-price alternative to the established players. It also gave Virgin access to terminal space without which growth would have been significantly limited. Delays in negotiating access to the former Ansett terminal at [[Sydney Airport]] however, forced Virgin to use its original terminal there\u2014a collection of prefabricated buildings without [[Jet bridge|aerobridges]]\u2014longer than was needed. As the airline grew, it acquired new equipment, enabling it to phase-out its older 737-400s in favour of [[Boeing 737 Next Generation|737-700 and \u2212800]] series aircraft with modern glass cockpits, winglets and greater fuel efficiency.\n\nVirgin Group's holding in Virgin Australia has since been reduced, initially via a sale of a half interest to Australian logistics conglomerate [[Patrick Corporation]], and later by a public [[Initial Public Offering|float]]. In early 2005 Patrick launched a hostile takeover for Virgin Blue. Patrick had been unhappy for some time with the company's direction. By the closure of the offer, Patrick held 62% of the company, giving it control. Virgin Group retains a 25% share.\n\nIn May 2006 [[Toll Holdings]] acquired Patrick and became the majority owner of Virgin Blue. In July 2008 Toll sold its majority holding via a special dividend to hold 1.7% of the company. In June 2013 Air New Zealand owned 23% of the company.<ref name=Australian6Jun13>[http://www.theaustralian.com.au/business/aviation/air-nz-revealed-as-buyer-of-3pc-additional-virgin-stake/story-e6frg95x-1226658272262 Air NZ revealed as buyer of 3pc additional Virgin stake] ''The Australian'' 6 June 2013</ref>\n\n[[File:Virgin Blue Boeing 737-800 PER Monty-3.jpg|thumb|[[Boeing 737 Next Generation|Boeing 737\u2013800]] in the old Virgin Blue red livery at [[Perth Airport]] in 2004]]\nVirgin Blue previously used a familiar formula pioneered by airlines such as [[Southwest Airlines]] and [[Ryanair]] of eliminating costs such as included [[airline meal|in-flight meals]] and printed tickets in favour of selling food on-board and using telephone and internet booking systems.

Originally this was called ''The Blue Room'' and provided facilities to members and guests on a pay-as-you-go basis. Many of these facilities became available when Virgin relocated into the former [[Ansett Australia|Ansett]] terminals across the country, with the defunct ''Golden Wing club'' lounges left behind being used as Blue Room lounges, complete with furnishings.\n\nIn 2006, Virgin revamped the lounge facilities and re-launched the product as ''The Lounge'', which offered all-inclusive facilities on a membership fee or casual fee basis. Upgraded facilities provided included [[buffet]] food and refreshments, newspapers, showers, computers, and [[WiFi]] internet access for travellers.\n\nIn May 2011, Virgin again renamed the lounge simply referring to it as ''Virgin Australia lounge'' \u2013 designed to be a premium experience, with spaces designed for specific uses and 'moods'.{{citation needed|date=June 2019}}\n\n===Access===\nMembership can be purchased online by logging into a passenger's Velocity Frequent Flyer account. Membership fees vary depending on the elite status level. Lifetime memberships are also available for purchase.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.virginaustralia.com/au/en/experience/at-the-airport/lounge/#prices-and-membership |title=Virgin Australia Lounge Membership Prices |publisher=Virginaustralia.com |date=31 December 2011 |accessdate=3 April 2013}}</ref>\n\n==Velocity Frequent Flyer Program==\n{{main|Velocity Frequent Flyer}}\nVirgin Australia launched its [[frequent-flyer program]] Velocity Rewards in 2005, with partner [[National Australia Bank]] offering a companion credit card. By 2007, points collected from selected [[Westpac]], [[American Express]] and [[Diners Club]] cards could be transferred to Velocity Rewards, and effective September 2008, ANZ reward visa card points as well. The program reached 4 million members by the end of 2014.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.virginaustralia.com/au/en/about-us/media/2014/VEL__FOUR_MILLION_MEMBERS/ |title=Velocity Frequent Flyer reaches four million members |publisher=Virgin Australia |accessdate=15 August 2015}}</ref>\n\nStatus levels were introduced to the program in late 2007 as part of continued efforts to attract business travellers. Alongside the entry-level \"red\" status, frequent travellers were given the opportunity to attain \"silver\" and \"gold\" status, each with its own set of benefits.\n\nInitially, Velocity was different from most other frequent flyer programs, as points were earned relative to the cost of a flight, rather than distance. Velocity members originally earned 6 points per dollar spent on Virgin Australia flights. This was later altered due to the introduction of status levels; Red members now earned 5 points per dollar, Silver members remained at 6 points, and Gold members earned 7. Points accrual on V Australia, as well as the majority of Velocity's airline partners, have always based on distance.\n\nVelocity was the first frequent flyer program in Australia to offer \"any seat, any time\" reward flight availability. The number of points required to redeem an award seat directly corresponds to the current fare of that seat, allowing any seat currently available to be redeemed. [[Qantas]] introduced a similar feature to their frequent flyer program in May 2008.\n\nIn August 2011, the program was relaunched as \"Velocity Frequent Flyer\" and a platinum status level was introduced, among other changes.\n\nIn July 2013, Velocity introduced the Global Wallet function, which was the first prepaid traveller card in Australia.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ausbt.com.au/virgin-australia-s-new-global-wallet-travel-money-card |title=Virgin Australia's new Global Wallet travel money card |publisher=Australian Business Traveller |accessdate=15 August 2015}}</ref> The key feature of this card is it allows you to load your money and store it in other supported currencies before travelling. You can access to ATMs around the world as well as shop at anywhere where visa is accepted. Supported currencies include Australian Dollar (AUD), Canadian Dollar (CAD), Euro (EUR), Pound Sterling (GBP), Hong Kong Dollar (HKD), Japanese Yen (JPY), New Zealand Dollar (NZD), Singapore Dollar (SGD), Thai Baht (THB), US Dollar (USD) and South African Rand (ZAR). You also earn 1 Velocity Point per $1 spent overseas and 1 point per $2 spent in Australia.\n\nIn 2015, Velocity Frequent Flyer won the 'Program of the Year\" in the Middle East & Asia/Oceania District category at the Freddie Awards.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://freddieawards.com/2015-annual-freddie-awards-27th/ |title=2015 Annual Freddie Awards (27th) Results |publisher=Freddie Awards |accessdate=15 August 2015}}</ref>\n\n==Controversies==\n* In 2003, a man with a disability and having incomplete [[quadriplegia]] was removed from a Virgin Blue flight because staff thought he was drunk or a terrorist.

Ansett's failure allowed Virgin to grow rapidly to become Australia's second domestic carrier, rather than staying just a cut-price alternative to the established players. It also gave Virgin access to terminal space without which growth would have been significantly limited. Delays in negotiating access to the former Ansett terminal at [[Sydney Airport]] however, forced Virgin to use its original terminal there\u2014a collection of prefabricated buildings without [[Jet bridge|aerobridges]]\u2014longer than was needed. As the airline grew, it acquired new equipment, enabling it to phase-out its older 737-400s in favour of [[Boeing 737 Next Generation|737-700 and \u2212800]] series aircraft with modern glass cockpits, winglets and greater fuel efficiency.\n\nVirgin Group's holding in Virgin Australia has since been reduced, initially via a sale of a half interest to Australian logistics conglomerate [[Patrick Corporation]], and later by a public [[Initial Public Offering|float]]. In early 2005 Patrick launched a hostile takeover for Virgin Blue. Patrick had been unhappy for some time with the company's direction. By the closure of the offer, Patrick held 62% of the company, giving it control. Virgin Group retains a 25% share.\n\nIn May 2006 [[Toll Holdings]] acquired Patrick and became the majority owner of Virgin Blue. In July 2008 Toll sold its majority holding via a special dividend to hold 1.7% of the company. In June 2013 Air New Zealand owned 23% of the company.<ref name=Australian6Jun13>[http://www.theaustralian.com.au/business/aviation/air-nz-revealed-as-buyer-of-3pc-additional-virgin-stake/story-e6frg95x-1226658272262 Air NZ revealed as buyer of 3pc additional Virgin stake] ''The Australian'' 6 June 2013</ref>\n\n[[File:Virgin Blue Boeing 737-800 PER Monty-3.jpg|thumb|[[Boeing 737 Next Generation|Boeing 737\u2013800]] in the old Virgin Blue red livery at [[Perth Airport]] in 2004]]\nVirgin Blue previously used a familiar formula pioneered by airlines such as [[Southwest Airlines]] and [[Ryanair]] of eliminating costs such as included [[airline meal|in-flight meals]] and printed tickets in favour of selling food on-board and using telephone and internet booking systems.

However, after the collapse of its domestic competitor Ansett Australia, it began a codeshare agreement with [[United Airlines]]. This allowed United customers to fly from the United States to any of Virgin Blue's Australian destinations that United did not already serve. In 2006, in an effort to compete with Qantas, Virgin Blue started exploring these relationships, forming frequent flyer agreements with [[Emirates (airline)|Emirates]], [[Hawaiian Airlines]] and [[Malaysia Airlines]]. Virgin Blue also has an Interline Agreement with Regional Express Airlines for travellers to and from smaller regional centres in the eastern states of Australia, and operates its own two routes with [[Virgin Australia Regional Airlines]] in Western Australia. In November 2007, the airline announced an agreement with [[Garuda Indonesia]], offering easy transfer from a domestic Virgin Blue flight to an international Garuda Indonesia service departing from [[Perth, Western Australia|Perth]], Melbourne, Sydney or [[Darwin, Northern Territory|Darwin]]. Since then Virgin Blue also announced an agreement with [[Vietnam Airlines]] which allows passengers to fly from Melbourne and Sydney and connect with Vietnam Airlines' destinations through its flight network.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.virginaustralia.com/au/en/about-us/media/2008/D_020039/ |title=A \"V\" Good Partnership \u2013 Virgin Blue And Vietnam Airlines Sign Interline Agreement |publisher=Virginaustralia.com |date=7 April 2008 |accessdate=3 April 2013}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Forward fuselage of Virgin Australia (VH-YFC) Boeing 737-81D at Sydney Airport.jpg|thumb|Close-up of the new Virgin Australia titles on Boeing 737 ''[[Bondi Beach]]'', at [[Sydney Airport]] for the launch of the new brand]]\n[[File:Virgin Blue logo.svg|thumb|The former Virgin Blue logo, used until May 2011]] \nIn 2008, premium economy class was introduced throughout its entire fleet.

Originally this was called ''The Blue Room'' and provided facilities to members and guests on a pay-as-you-go basis. Many of these facilities became available when Virgin relocated into the former [[Ansett Australia|Ansett]] terminals across the country, with the defunct ''Golden Wing club'' lounges left behind being used as Blue Room lounges, complete with furnishings.\n\nIn 2006, Virgin revamped the lounge facilities and re-launched the product as ''The Lounge'', which offered all-inclusive facilities on a membership fee or casual fee basis. Upgraded facilities provided included [[buffet]] food and refreshments, newspapers, showers, computers, and [[WiFi]] internet access for travellers.\n\nIn May 2011, Virgin again renamed the lounge simply referring to it as ''Virgin Australia lounge'' \u2013 designed to be a premium experience, with spaces designed for specific uses and 'moods'.{{citation needed|date=June 2019}}\n\n===Access===\nMembership can be purchased online by logging into a passenger's Velocity Frequent Flyer account. Membership fees vary depending on the elite status level. Lifetime memberships are also available for purchase.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.virginaustralia.com/au/en/experience/at-the-airport/lounge/#prices-and-membership |title=Virgin Australia Lounge Membership Prices |publisher=Virginaustralia.com |date=31 December 2011 |accessdate=3 April 2013}}</ref>\n\n==Velocity Frequent Flyer Program==\n{{main|Velocity Frequent Flyer}}\nVirgin Australia launched its [[frequent-flyer program]] Velocity Rewards in 2005, with partner [[National Australia Bank]] offering a companion credit card. By 2007, points collected from selected [[Westpac]], [[American Express]] and [[Diners Club]] cards could be transferred to Velocity Rewards, and effective September 2008, ANZ reward visa card points as well. The program reached 4 million members by the end of 2014.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.virginaustralia.com/au/en/about-us/media/2014/VEL__FOUR_MILLION_MEMBERS/ |title=Velocity Frequent Flyer reaches four million members |publisher=Virgin Australia |accessdate=15 August 2015}}</ref>\n\nStatus levels were introduced to the program in late 2007 as part of continued efforts to attract business travellers. Alongside the entry-level \"red\" status, frequent travellers were given the opportunity to attain \"silver\" and \"gold\" status, each with its own set of benefits.\n\nInitially, Velocity was different from most other frequent flyer programs, as points were earned relative to the cost of a flight, rather than distance. Velocity members originally earned 6 points per dollar spent on Virgin Australia flights. This was later altered due to the introduction of status levels; Red members now earned 5 points per dollar, Silver members remained at 6 points, and Gold members earned 7. Points accrual on V Australia, as well as the majority of Velocity's airline partners, have always based on distance.\n\nVelocity was the first frequent flyer program in Australia to offer \"any seat, any time\" reward flight availability. The number of points required to redeem an award seat directly corresponds to the current fare of that seat, allowing any seat currently available to be redeemed. [[Qantas]] introduced a similar feature to their frequent flyer program in May 2008.\n\nIn August 2011, the program was relaunched as \"Velocity Frequent Flyer\" and a platinum status level was introduced, among other changes.\n\nIn July 2013, Velocity introduced the Global Wallet function, which was the first prepaid traveller card in Australia.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ausbt.com.au/virgin-australia-s-new-global-wallet-travel-money-card |title=Virgin Australia's new Global Wallet travel money card |publisher=Australian Business Traveller |accessdate=15 August 2015}}</ref> The key feature of this card is it allows you to load your money and store it in other supported currencies before travelling. You can access to ATMs around the world as well as shop at anywhere where visa is accepted. Supported currencies include Australian Dollar (AUD), Canadian Dollar (CAD), Euro (EUR), Pound Sterling (GBP), Hong Kong Dollar (HKD), Japanese Yen (JPY), New Zealand Dollar (NZD), Singapore Dollar (SGD), Thai Baht (THB), US Dollar (USD) and South African Rand (ZAR). You also earn 1 Velocity Point per $1 spent overseas and 1 point per $2 spent in Australia.\n\nIn 2015, Velocity Frequent Flyer won the 'Program of the Year\" in the Middle East & Asia/Oceania District category at the Freddie Awards.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://freddieawards.com/2015-annual-freddie-awards-27th/ |title=2015 Annual Freddie Awards (27th) Results |publisher=Freddie Awards |accessdate=15 August 2015}}</ref>\n\n==Controversies==\n* In 2003, a man with a disability and having incomplete [[quadriplegia]] was removed from a Virgin Blue flight because staff thought he was drunk or a terrorist.

It was notably the first original American musical to be produced by Lincoln Center Theatre. Flaherty would eventually go on to write three additional original musicals for Lincoln Center Theatre, all in collaboration with Ms. Ahrens: [[A Man of No Importance (musical)|A Man Of No Importance]] (2002, with a book by Terrence McNally), [[Dessa Rose (musical)|Dessa Rose]] (2005) and [[The Glorious Ones]] (2007.)

After an out of town run in Boston, the show opened at the Richard Rodgers Theater on November 30, 2000.\n\nThe original Broadway cast album was nominated for a Grammy, and Flaherty also received a Drama Desk nomination for Best Music.\n\nWhen the stock and amateur rights to the show were released following the Broadway run and its subsequent national tour, ''Seussical'' immediately became the most performed show in America.  In 2008, there was a critically acclaimed off-Broadway revival directed by Marcia Milgrom Dodge, who would also go on to direct the Tony-nominated revival of ''Ragtime'' the following year.\n\nAfter writing three shows for Lincoln Center Theatre, Flaherty and Ahrens next returned to Broadway with the musical ''[[Rocky]]''.

All the vignettes are danced without words. Lynn Ahrens wrote the lyrics for the title song.  The show starred [[Donna McKechnie]] and [[George Chakiris]] and eighteen powerhouse dancers.  The musical had a staged workshop during the summer of 2014 at New York Stage and Film & Vassar's [[Powerhouse Theater]] at Vassar College.[[Stephen Flaherty#cite note-21|.]]\n\nFor the concert hall, Flaherty wrote the music for \u201cWith Voices Raised\u201d (text by Lynn Ahrens), which was commissioned by the Boston Pops Orchestra in 1999.

It was notably the first original American musical to be produced by Lincoln Center Theatre. Flaherty would eventually go on to write three additional original musicals for Lincoln Center Theatre, all in collaboration with Ms. Ahrens: [[A Man of No Importance (musical)|A Man Of No Importance]] (2002, with a book by Terrence McNally), [[Dessa Rose (musical)|Dessa Rose]] (2005) and [[The Glorious Ones]] (2007.)

After an out of town run in Boston, the show opened at the Richard Rodgers Theater on November 30, 2000.\n\nThe original Broadway cast album was nominated for a Grammy, and Flaherty also received a Drama Desk nomination for Best Music.\n\nWhen the stock and amateur rights to the show were released following the Broadway run and its subsequent national tour, ''Seussical'' immediately became the most performed show in America.  In 2008, there was a critically acclaimed off-Broadway revival directed by Marcia Milgrom Dodge, who would also go on to direct the Tony-nominated revival of ''Ragtime'' the following year.\n\nAfter writing three shows for Lincoln Center Theatre, Flaherty and Ahrens next returned to Broadway with the musical ''[[Rocky]]''.

The show premiered at the Kennedy Center's Eisenhower Theater in October 2014. The cast included [[Rebecca Luker]], [[Boyd Gaines]] and [[Tiler Peck]].  The musical is inspired by true events and focuses on the relationship between a young ballerina and 19th century French painter and sculptor [[Edgar Degas]]. Much of the action is set in the [[Paris Opera Ballet]].  A re-working of the show, now titled ''Marie, Dancing Still'' (after the name of the young ballerina),had its west coast premiere at Seattle's 5th Avenue Theatre in March 2019.\n\nFlaherty's next Broadway musical was [[Anastasia (musical)|Anastasia]], featuring lyrics by Ms. Ahrens, a book by Terrence McNally, and based on the Twentieth Century Fox films.

The show was subsequently produced in Madrid, Stuttgart and on tour in the United States in 2018, with a production in The Hague to open in 2019. During the 2017-2018 Broadway season Flaherty and Ahrens had the rare honor of having two shows running on Broadway at the same time, ''Anastasia'' and the revival of ''Once On This Island.''\n\nFor his work in film, Flaherty was nominated for two Academy Awards with lyricist Ahrens (for Best Song and Best Score, the latter shared with David Newman) and two Golden Globe Awards for his first film, Twentieth Century Fox's animated [[Anastasia (1997 film)|''Anastasia'']] (1997).

He composed the song score and co-wrote the film score for ''Lucky Stiff'' (2014), which was based on his and Ms. Ahrens\u2019 stage musical of the same name.\n\nOccasionally Mr. Flaherty writes with other collaborators.  His \u201cchamber-scale musical,\u201d ''Loving Repeating: A Musical of Gertrude Stein'', written with his ''Ragtime'' director, [[Frank Galati]], premiered in Chicago in February 2006, in a co-production between the About Face Theatre and the Museum of Contemporary Art.<sup>[[Stephen Flaherty#cite note-gert-17|[11]]]</sup>  The musical won Chicago's Joseph Jefferson Award as the \u201cBest New Work\u201d of the year.  An earlier version of the show was initially titled ''A Long Gay Book'', and had its premiere at [[Northwestern University]] in May 2003.<sup>[[Stephen Flaherty#cite note-book-18|[12]]]</sup>\n\nFlaherty collaborated with the director-choreographer [[Christopher Gattelli]] on a new \"dance-theatre musical\", ''In Your Arms'', which premiered at the [[Old Globe Theatre]], San Diego, California,September 24, 2015. The show consists of 10 vignettes on the topic of \u201cromantic destiny\u201d, which were written by [[Douglas Carter Beane]], [[Nilo Cruz]], [[Christopher Durang]], [[Carrie Fisher]], [[David Henry Hwang]], [[Rajiv Joseph]], [[Terrence McNally]], [[Marsha Norman]], [[Lynn Nottage]] and [[Alfred Uhry]], all of which were set to music by Flaherty. All the vignettes are danced without words. Lynn Ahrens wrote the lyrics for the title song.  The show starred [[Donna McKechnie]] and [[George Chakiris]] and eighteen powerhouse dancers.  The musical had a staged workshop during the summer of 2014 at New York Stage and Film & Vassar's [[Powerhouse Theater]] at Vassar College.[[Stephen Flaherty#cite note-21|.]]\n\nFor the concert hall, Flaherty wrote the music for \u201cWith Voices Raised\u201d (text by Lynn Ahrens), which was commissioned by the Boston Pops Orchestra in 1999.  It had its world premiere in Boston on July 4, 1999,  which was nationally televised, featuring Senator Ted Kennedy as one of the speakers.  It was subsequently released on the Pops\u2019 recording \u201cA Splash Of Pops\u201d on the RCA Victor Label, July 13, 1999 .He also wrote the music for the \"American River Suite\", with lyrics by Bill Schermerhorn and commissioned by [[Macy's]].

It was broadcast nationally on the Fourth of July of that same year.\n\nHe has received several commissions from Carnegie Hall, the [[Solomon R.

Among Norwegians, the day is referred to simply as '''''syttende mai''''' (lit. \"seventeenth May\"), ''Nasjonaldagen'' (The National Day) or ''Grunnlovsdagen'' (The Constitution Day), although the latter is less frequent.<ref name =n0517>[https://www.visitnorway.com/about/history-traditions/national-day/ Norway's national day - Hurray! It's the 17th of May] www.visitnorway.com {{in lang|en}}</ref>\n\n== Historical background ==\n[[Image:Krohg-17.mai.1893.jpg|thumb|''17th of May 1893'' by Norwegian painter [[Christian Krohg]] (1852\u20131925). The flag does not have the [[Union badge of Norway and Sweden]], the so-called [[sildesalaten]] (Herring salad).]]\n\nThe [[Constitution of Norway]] was [[Norway in 1814|signed]] at [[Eidsvoll]] on May 17 in the year 1814. The constitution declared Norway to be an independent kingdom in an attempt to avoid being ceded to Sweden after [[Denmark\u2013Norway]]'s devastating defeat in the [[Napoleonic Wars]].\n\nThe celebration of this day began spontaneously among students and others from early on. However, Norway was at that time in a union with Sweden (following the [[Convention of Moss]] in August 1814) and for some years the King of Sweden and Norway was reluctant to allow the celebrations. For a few years during the 1820s, King [[Charles XIV John of Sweden|Karl Johan]] actually banned it, believing that celebrations like this were, in fact, a kind of protest and disregard \u2014 even revolt \u2014 against the union.<ref>{{cite news |title=Kampen om toget |author=Stein Erik Kirkeb\u00f8en |url=http://www.aftenposten.no/fakta/innsikt/article2425297.ece |newspaper=Aftenposten |date=16 May 2008 |accessdate=21 Jan 2013|language=Norwegian}}</ref> The king's attitude changed after the [[Battle of the Square]] in 1829, an incident which resulted in such a commotion that the king had to allow commemorations on the day. It was, however, not until 1833 that public addresses were held, and official celebration was initiated near the monument of former government minister [[Christian Krohg (government minister)|Christian Krohg]], who had spent much of his political life curbing the personal power of the monarch. The address was held by [[Henrik Wergeland]], thoroughly witnessed and accounted for by an [[informant]] dispatched by the king himself.\n\nAfter 1864 the day became more established when the first children's parade was launched in [[Christiania, Norway|Christiania]], at first consisting only of boys. This initiative was taken by [[Bj\u00f8rnstjerne Bj\u00f8rnson]], although Wergeland made the first known children's parade at [[Eidsvoll]] around 1820. It was only in 1899 that girls were allowed to join in the parade for the first time. In 1905, the union with Sweden was dissolved and Prince Carl of Denmark was chosen to be King of an independent Norway, under the name Haakon VII. Obviously, this ended any Swedish concern for the activities of the National Day.\n\nBy historical coincidence, the [[World War II|Second World War]] ended in Norway nine days before that year's Constitution Day, on May 8, 1945, when the occupying German forces surrendered. Even if The Liberation Day is an official flag day in Norway, the day is not an official holiday and is not widely celebrated. Instead, a new and broader meaning has been added to the celebration of Norwegian Constitution Day on May 17.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.17thofmay.org/history/|title=History of the 17th of May in Norway & Seattle|first=The Norwegian Seventeenth of May Committee|website=17th of May Festival|url-status=live|access-date=4/20/2020}}</ref>\n\n==Children's parades==\n{{unreferenced|section|date=May 2017}}\n[[File:The Norwegian Royal Family in 2007.jpg|thumb|In Oslo, the children's parade ends in the palace gardens of the [[Royal Palace, Oslo|Royal Palace]] with the [[Norwegian Royal Family]] present on the balcony. <small>2006</small>]]\n[[File:Barnetog 17mai.jpg|thumb|The kindergarten part of a Children's parade. The [[G\u00e1kti]], the traditional clothing of the [[Sami people]], is used by one of the small children.]]\n\nA noteworthy aspect of the Norwegian Constitution Day is its very non-military nature. All over Norway, children's parades with an abundance of [[Flag of Norway|flags]] form the central elements of the celebration. Each elementary school district arranges its own parade<ref>The Norwegian language has several distinct words for the English term \"parade\": \"Parade\", which refers to a military-like parade, and \"tog\" or \"opptog\", which refer to people walking in a predefined route just like a train moving along its track. The Norwegian word for \"train\", \"tog\", is derived from the [[Old Norse]] word for \"rope\" \u2014 indicating a row of people walking in a long line. The word \"tog\" was used of people walking in procession before the country ever got trains. In [[Bergen, Norway|Bergen]], the parade is known as a \"prosesjon\" (procession).</ref> with marching bands between schools. The parade takes the children through the community, often making stops at homes of senior citizens, war memorials, etc. The longest parade is in [[Oslo]], where some 100,000 people travel to the city centre to participate in the main festivities. This is broadcast on TV every year, with comments on costumes, banners, etc., together with local reports from celebrations around the country. The massive Oslo parade includes some 100 schools, marching bands, and passes the royal palace where the royal family greet the people from the main balcony.\n\nTypically, a school's children parade will consist of some senior school children carrying the school's official banner, followed by a handful of other older children carrying full-size Norwegian flags, and the school's marching band. After the band, the rest of the school children follow with hand-sized flags, often with the junior forms first, and often behind self-made banners for each form or even individual class. Nearby kindergartens may also have been invited to join in. As the parade passes, bystanders often join in behind the official parade and follow the parade back to the school.\n\nDepending on the community, the parade may make stops at particular sites along the route, such as a nursing home or war memorial. In Oslo, the parade stops at the [[Royal Palace, Oslo|Royal Palace]] while [[Skaugum]], the home of the crown prince, has been a traditional waypoint for parades in [[Asker]].\n\nDuring the parade, a marching band will play and the children will sing lyrics about the celebration of the National Day. The parade concludes with the stationary singing of the national anthem \"[[Ja, vi elsker dette landet]]\" (typically verses 1, 7 and 8), and the royal anthem \"[[Kongesangen]]\".\n\nIn addition to flags, people typically wear red, white and blue ribbons. Although a long-standing tradition, it has lately become more popular for men, women and children to wear traditional outfits, called ''[[bunad]]''. The children also make a lot of noise shouting \"Hurra!\", singing, blowing whistles and shaking rattles.\n\n==Additional celebration==\nAll over Norway are memorials to the fallen at wars and to other notable national people honoured with speeches and [[wreaths]] early in the morning. At many places (like in Oslo) at noon, [[21-gun salute|salute]] is fired.\n\nIn addition to children's parades, there are parades for the public (''borgertog''), where every citizen is welcome to join in. These are led by marching bands and often local boy scouts and girl guides, local choirs, [[Non-governmental organization|NGOs]] etc. This takes place in the early morning or in the afternoon, before or after the school's parade.\n\nAll parades begin or end with speeches. Both grown-ups and older children are invited to speak. After the parades, there are games for the children, and often a lot of ice cream, pop, sweets and hot-dogs are consumed.<ref name=\"n0517\" />\n\n==Russ==\n[[File:Russ med russeluer.jpg|thumb|High school graduates, \u00abruss\u00bb, during the children's parade in [[Trondheim]]]]\nThe graduating class from videreg\u00e5ende (upper secondary school, sixth form) the Norwegian equivalent of high school, known as [[Russefeiring|russ]], has its own celebration on May 17, staying up all night and making the rounds through the community. The russ also have their own parades later in the day, usually around 4 or 5 PM. In this parade, russ will parade through the street with their '''russebuss or russebil''' (russ bus or russ car) carrying signs and pickets. They may parody various local and political aspects, although recently this has become less frequent. Russ parades have lately become smaller and smaller due to diligent police discouragement.<ref name=\"n0517\" />\n\n==Celebration across the country==\n[[File:VestreTorggatenTorgallmenningenMay172009.jpg|thumb|350|The city of [[Bergen]] is full of people, and May 17 has a strong tradition in the city.]]\n[[File:17Mai2009 1.jpg|thumb|left|Norwegian constitution day celebration in [[Bergen]], Norway]]\nThe Constitution Day is celebrated in most small settlements and larger towns across Norway, with many variations.\n*In [[Oslo]], children from all the city's schools gather to parade past the Royal Palace, where they and the [[Norwegian Royal Family|Royal Family]] exchange waves and greetings.\n*In the municipality of [[Asker]], outside Oslo, the children gather outside the residence of the [[Haakon, Crown Prince of Norway|Crown Prince]] and [[Mette-Marit, Crown Princess of Norway|Princess]] at [[Skaugum]] Estate in the morning (giving the Prince and his family time to attend the parade in Oslo later in the day).\n*[[Bergen, Norway|Bergen]] has its own traditions for the parade, including comic troupes, various local organizations, a children's parade, and the unique [[buekorps]].\n*In [[Trondheim]], children from all the city's schools parade the streets of Trondheim in the morning. Later in the afternoon, the \"Citizens Parade\" (Borgertoget) starts. This is a parade where firefighters, sports teams, students associations and other associations are represented.\n*In [[Stavanger]] the day starts with a salute at 7 am. Later there are Children's Parade, Russ Parade and finally Citizens Parade. The British school has since the 1970s, later followed up by the Dutch school and the American school, carried flags from a number of countries from all over the world. An international party day is also arranged in the central Bjerkstedparken every May 17.\n*In [[Kristiansand]], in addition to parades of schoolchildren and citizens earlier that day, the city is known for the conclusion of the National Day with running through the city center (\"Tapto\") and spectacular [[fireworks]]. For those who want to continue the party until midnight, a [[trad jazz]] band with local touches plays until midnight in front of the [[Christiansholm Fortress]] (Free entrance).<ref>[https://www.kristiansand.kommune.no/globalassets/aktuelt/2017/program-may-17th-2017-english.pdf Program in City centre, City of Kristiansand May 17th 2017] {{in lang|en}}</ref>\n\nIn addition to the children's parades the streets across the country are filled with young and old, turning out in festive attire, and vendors selling ice cream, hot dogs, and lately, kebabs.\n\nIn many neighborhoods, small towns and villages, it is common to have their own events with easy dining and fun, unpretentious competitions for children.\n\nAlthough May 17 is the National Day, foreigners are welcome to join in with all activities.<ref name=\"n0517\" />\n\n==Celebration abroad==\n[[File:17MaiLutefisk2006-05-17.JPG|thumb|17 May dinner in the United States of [[lutefisk]], [[rutabaga]], [[Swedish meatballs|meatballs]], [[lingonberry jam]], and [[lefse]].]]\nSyttende Mai is also celebrated in many [[Norwegian-American|Norwegian immigrant communities]] throughout the world, with traditional foods, sometimes including [[lutefisk]]. In the United States and Canada, the local lodges of the [[Sons of Norway]] often play a central part in organizing the festivities.\n\nThe Bay Ridge neighborhood in [[Brooklyn]], [[New York City]] has had an annual 17 May Parade and celebration since 1952.  It is well-attended and celebrated by Norwegian-Americans who immigrated to Brooklyn in the early 20th century.<ref>[http://www.may17paradeny.com/ 17th of May Parade Committee] Norwegian-American 17th of May Committee of Greater New York {{in lang|en}}</ref>\n\nOne major celebration occurs in [[Petersburg, Alaska]] also known as \"Little Norway\". The town is a Norwegian settlement and strongly retains its roots. The festival occurs the weekend closest to May 17 and includes a parade, [[Leikarring dancers]], herring toss, Norwegian pastries such as [[lefse]] and even a pack of [[Vikings]] and [[Valkyries]].<ref>[http://www.petersburg.org/visitor/littlenorway.html Velkommen til Petersburg], petersburg.org</ref>\n\nAnother major Syttende Mai celebration occurs in [[Stoughton, Wisconsin]] which, along with [[Seattle, Washington]],<ref name=\"Syttende Mai in Seattle\">{{cite web|url=http://www.syttendemaiseattle.com/|title=Syttende Mai in Seattle}}</ref> claims to be the 2nd largest in the world, and the largest in the U.S. Festivities include canoe racing, two parades, an art fair, a 20-mile run that starts in [[Madison, Wisconsin]], and a great deal of bratwurst consumption. The festival features the Stoughton High School Norwegian Dancers, a group that tours the country showcasing [[List of ethnic, regional, and folk dances sorted by origin#Scandinavia|traditional ethnic dances]] of [[Scandinavia]].<ref>[http://www.stoughtonwi.com/syttendemai.shtml Syttende Mai], stoughtonwi.com</ref>\n\nSmaller Syttende Mai celebrations are held in Norwegian-heritage communities throughout western Wisconsin, Minnesota, and elsewhere in the Midwestern United States.<ref>[http://www.norway.org/culture/May+17/May17.htm Syttende Mai in the Midwest], norway.org</ref> Members of Norway's Parliament [[Storting]] travel to [[Chicago]] to attend a three-day celebration consisting of a concert, banquet and parade hosted by the [[Norwegian National League]].<ref>[http://www.nnleague.org/parade.htm Syttende Mai Parade], nnleague.org</ref> [[Spring Grove, Minnesota]] also hosts a 3-day festival on the weekend nearest to Syttende Mai, while nearby [[Decorah, Iowa]], the home of [[Nordic Fest]] and the [[Vesterheim Norwegian-American Museum]], also hosts a parade.  Syttende Mai is also celebrated in [[Oswego, New York]].  Since 1969, the city of [[Westby, Wisconsin|Westby]] in western Wisconsin has celebrated a four-day festival featuring authentic Norwegian foods, crafts, a \"frokost\" and Norwegian church service.\n\nOther large celebrations are held in the [[Ballard, Seattle|Ballard]] neighborhood of [[Seattle]], Washington, (which also claims to be the largest Syttende Mai parade outside of Oslo)<ref name=\"Syttende Mai in Seattle\"/> [[Poulsbo, Washington]],<ref>[http://www.vikingfest.org/ Viking Fest Carnival], vikingfest.org</ref> and [[Bay Ridge, Brooklyn]]. [[Epcot]]'s Norwegian Pavilion in Florida, celebrates Constitution Day with numerous flags around the pavilion, as well as parades around the World Showcase Lagoon. [http://utah17mai.com/index.html Salt Lake City, Utah], holds its annual celebration at the International Peace Gardens where 400-700 people attend each year.\n\nThe Norwegian community in [[London]] holds a May 17 celebration each year in [[Southwark Park]]. The celebration is attended by a large number of Norwegians abroad and includes a small parade, a traditional service in the church, and the selling of traditional Norwegian foods such as ''Solo'' and ''makrell i tomat'', and a lot of Norwegian flags for Norwegians who have left theirs at home. \n\nIn [[Orkney]], Scotland, 17. May is celebrated by the Orkney Norway Friendship Association in recognition of the islands' strong historic links with Norway,<ref>[http://www.orkney.com/norway Orkney Norway Friendship Association], orkney.com</ref> with similar celebrations taking place in neighbouring [[Shetland]].\n\nIn [[Glasgow]], Scotland, the 17th of May is celebrated at Murano Street Student Village where Norwegian students and their friends congregate to enjoy the traditional festivities of the day. This includes the wearing of Norwegian traditional colours as well as the consumption of copious amounts of alcoholic beverages.\n\n[[Stockholm]], Sweden, has a big celebration with a parade starting at Engelbrektsplan and ending at [[Skansen]], in which more than 10,000 participate every year. The event includes Stockholm's only dedicated 17. May marching band, Det Norske Korps.<ref>[http://www.dnk.se 17. May in Stockholm], Det Norske Korps {{in lang|no}}</ref>\n\nIt is also common for Norwegians living abroad to gather and celebrate. In some countries, typically where the population of Norwegian expatriates is small, the Norwegian embassy or the diplomats' spouses arrange the event.\n\nIn New Zealand the 17th of May is celebrated in Fiordland, a small piece of Norway in the fjords and mountains of southwest New Zealand. All Fjordland buildings are made of eucalyptus and are inspired by Norwegian architecture. They have an exposition of photos and facts about Norway, typical food, and a presentation with six Fjord Horses making a choreography with Norwegian music Vi p\u00e5 Langedrag by Sigmund Groven.\n\nNorsewood in New Zealand also Celebrates Norway Day with Church service, Folk dancing displays by school children and Norwegian songs performed by village choir.\n\n\n<gallery>\nSoldiers celebrating the national holiday of Norway in Afghanistan.jpg|Soldiers celebrating the national holiday in [[Meymaneh]], [[Afghanistan]].\nSyttende Mai, Ballard, Seattle, 2010-3.jpg|Norwegian Constitution Day, celebrated in [[Ballard, Seattle]].\n17th of May in Sydney, New South Wales, Australia.jpg|17 May in [[Sydney]]\n</gallery>\n\n==Henrik Wergeland==\nThe poet [[Henrik Wergeland]] is credited with making ''S\u00f8ttende/Syttende mai'' a celebratory day for the children rather than a day of patriotic pride. Actually, the day demonstrates that the children, i.e. the country's future, ''are'' the patriotic pride, if we follow Wergeland's thought. Flags and music dominate the day, and there are few military parades. To commemorate his contribution, the russ in Oslo place an oversized hat on his statue near the Norwegian [[Stortinget|parliament]]; the [[Jews in Norway|Jewish community]] place a [[wreath]] on his grave in the morning as a tribute to his efforts on their behalf.\n\n==Military participation==\n[[File:Garden 1.jpg|thumb|220px|The Royal Guard Norwegian Constitution Day parade]]\nThe [[Hans Majestet Kongens Garde|Royal Guard]] performs on the main street of the capital city, Oslo. During the parade, the Guard display their drill and musical skills. The marching band of the Royal Guard also attend the children's parade in central Oslo together with the schools' own marching bands, their black uniforms and impeccable drill being a very popular part of the Oslo parade.<ref name=\"n0517\" />\n\nForsvarets Musikkorps Vestlandet (Norwegian Armed Forces' Music Corps Western Norway), followed by parts of the military defence is participating in the parade of Bergen.\n\n==An inclusive holiday==\nThe former Norwegian president of parliament [[Jo Benkow]] noted that the day has increasingly become a celebration of Norway's growing ethnic diversity.\n\nSeveral factors have probably contributed to the inclusive nature of the celebration:\n*The central position of the children\u2019s parade, including all lower level school children, and therefore also their parents in the celebration.\n*The celebration is focused around local schools and their children\u2019s parade.\n*The children\u2019s parade reaches outwards, trying to cover as many roads as possible in the local community.\n*The low focus on elected government during the celebration. In the capital, for example, the children\u2019s parade passes the left side of the parliament building, and the president of parliament is allowed to wave to the passing parade from a small balcony,<ref>A funny side-note showing the low focus of elected government is the balcony the president of parliament is using: In the earlier days this was a small, temporary balcony added to one of the windows of the parliament building just before the National Day and removed afterwards. Prior to the parade the president of parliament must have carefully climbed out of the window and onto the balcony, while during the parade itself his mind must have switched between remembering to wave to the children parading and worrying if the balcony would fall down. Today the parliament building has a quite small, but permanent balcony that looks less likely to collapse.</ref> but the main focus of the parade is the Royal Palace and the Royal Family. The office of president of parliament is mainly ceremonial and administrative, often awarded in the later part of a political career.

The flag does not have the [[Union badge of Norway and Sweden]], the so-called [[sildesalaten]] (Herring salad).]]\n\nThe [[Constitution of Norway]] was [[Norway in 1814|signed]] at [[Eidsvoll]] on May 17 in the year 1814. The constitution declared Norway to be an independent kingdom in an attempt to avoid being ceded to Sweden after [[Denmark\u2013Norway]]'s devastating defeat in the [[Napoleonic Wars]].\n\nThe celebration of this day began spontaneously among students and others from early on. However, Norway was at that time in a union with Sweden (following the [[Convention of Moss]] in August 1814) and for some years the King of Sweden and Norway was reluctant to allow the celebrations. For a few years during the 1820s, King [[Charles XIV John of Sweden|Karl Johan]] actually banned it, believing that celebrations like this were, in fact, a kind of protest and disregard \u2014 even revolt \u2014 against the union.<ref>{{cite news |title=Kampen om toget |author=Stein Erik Kirkeb\u00f8en |url=http://www.aftenposten.no/fakta/innsikt/article2425297.ece |newspaper=Aftenposten |date=16 May 2008 |accessdate=21 Jan 2013|language=Norwegian}}</ref> The king's attitude changed after the [[Battle of the Square]] in 1829, an incident which resulted in such a commotion that the king had to allow commemorations on the day. It was, however, not until 1833 that public addresses were held, and official celebration was initiated near the monument of former government minister [[Christian Krohg (government minister)|Christian Krohg]], who had spent much of his political life curbing the personal power of the monarch. The address was held by [[Henrik Wergeland]], thoroughly witnessed and accounted for by an [[informant]] dispatched by the king himself.\n\nAfter 1864 the day became more established when the first children's parade was launched in [[Christiania, Norway|Christiania]], at first consisting only of boys. This initiative was taken by [[Bj\u00f8rnstjerne Bj\u00f8rnson]], although Wergeland made the first known children's parade at [[Eidsvoll]] around 1820. It was only in 1899 that girls were allowed to join in the parade for the first time. In 1905, the union with Sweden was dissolved and Prince Carl of Denmark was chosen to be King of an independent Norway, under the name Haakon VII. Obviously, this ended any Swedish concern for the activities of the National Day.\n\nBy historical coincidence, the [[World War II|Second World War]] ended in Norway nine days before that year's Constitution Day, on May 8, 1945, when the occupying German forces surrendered. Even if The Liberation Day is an official flag day in Norway, the day is not an official holiday and is not widely celebrated. Instead, a new and broader meaning has been added to the celebration of Norwegian Constitution Day on May 17.{{Citation needed|date=June 2011}}\n\n==Children's parades==\n{{unreferenced|section|date=May 2017}}\n[[File:The Norwegian Royal Family in 2007.jpg|thumb|In Oslo, the children's parade ends in the palace gardens of the [[Royal Palace, Oslo|Royal Palace]] with the [[Norwegian Royal Family]] present on the balcony. <small>2006</small>]]\n[[File:Barnetog 17mai.jpg|thumb|The kindergarten part of a Children's parade. The [[G\u00e1kti]], the traditional clothing of the [[Sami people]], is used by one of the small children.]]\n\nA noteworthy aspect of the Norwegian Constitution Day is its very non-military nature. All over Norway, children's parades with an abundance of [[Flag of Norway|flags]] form the central elements of the celebration. Each elementary school district arranges its own parade<ref>The Norwegian language has several distinct words for the English term \"parade\": \"Parade\", which refers to a military-like parade, and \"tog\" or \"opptog\", which refer to people walking in a predefined route just like a train moving along its track. The Norwegian word for \"train\", \"tog\", is derived from the [[Old Norse]] word for \"rope\" \u2014 indicating a row of people walking in a long line. The word \"tog\" was used of people walking in procession before the country ever got trains. In [[Bergen, Norway|Bergen]], the parade is known as a \"prosesjon\" (procession).</ref> with marching bands between schools. The parade takes the children through the community, often making stops at homes of senior citizens, war memorials, etc. The longest parade is in [[Oslo]], where some 100,000 people travel to the city centre to participate in the main festivities. This is broadcast on TV every year, with comments on costumes, banners, etc., together with local reports from celebrations around the country. The massive Oslo parade includes some 100 schools, marching bands, and passes the royal palace where the royal family greet the people from the main balcony.\n\nTypically, a school's children parade will consist of some senior school children carrying the school's official banner, followed by a handful of other older children carrying full-size Norwegian flags, and the school's marching band. After the band, the rest of the school children follow with hand-sized flags, often with the junior forms first, and often behind self-made banners for each form or even individual class. Nearby kindergartens may also have been invited to join in. As the parade passes, bystanders often join in behind the official parade and follow the parade back to the school.\n\nDepending on the community, the parade may make stops at particular sites along the route, such as a nursing home or war memorial. In Oslo, the parade stops at the [[Royal Palace, Oslo|Royal Palace]] while [[Skaugum]], the home of the crown prince, has been a traditional waypoint for parades in [[Asker]].\n\nDuring the parade, a marching band will play and the children will sing lyrics about the celebration of the National Day. The parade concludes with the stationary singing of the national anthem \"[[Ja, vi elsker dette landet]]\" (typically verses 1, 7 and 8), and the royal anthem \"[[Kongesangen]]\".\n\nIn addition to flags, people typically wear red, white and blue ribbons. Although a long-standing tradition, it has lately become more popular for men, women and children to wear traditional outfits, called ''[[bunad]]''. The children also make a lot of noise shouting \"Hurra!\", singing, blowing whistles and shaking rattles.\n\n==Additional celebration==\nAll over Norway are memorials to the fallen at wars and to other notable national people honoured with speeches and [[wreaths]] early in the morning. At many places (like in Oslo) at noon, [[21-gun salute|salute]] is fired.\n\nIn addition to children's parades, there are parades for the public (''borgertog''), where every citizen is welcome to join in. These are led by marching bands and often local boy scouts and girl guides, local choirs, [[Non-governmental organization|NGOs]] etc. This takes place in the early morning or in the afternoon, before or after the school's parade.\n\nAll parades begin or end with speeches. Both grown-ups and older children are invited to speak. After the parades, there are games for the children, and often a lot of ice cream, pop, sweets and hot-dogs are consumed.<ref name=\"n0517\" />\n\n==Russ==\n[[File:Russ med russeluer.jpg|thumb|High school graduates, \u00abruss\u00bb, during the children's parade in [[Trondheim]]]]\nThe graduating class from videreg\u00e5ende (upper secondary school, sixth form) the Norwegian equivalent of high school, known as [[Russefeiring|russ]], has its own celebration on May 17, staying up all night and making the rounds through the community. The russ also have their own parades later in the day, usually around 4 or 5 PM. In this parade, russ will parade through the street with their '''russebuss or russebil''' (russ bus or russ car) carrying signs and pickets. They may parody various local and political aspects, although recently this has become less frequent. Russ parades have lately become smaller and smaller due to diligent police discouragement.<ref name=\"n0517\" />\n\n==Celebration across the country==\n[[File:VestreTorggatenTorgallmenningenMay172009.jpg|thumb|350|The city of [[Bergen]] is full of people, and May 17 has a strong tradition in the city.]]\n[[File:17Mai2009 1.jpg|thumb|left|Norwegian constitution day celebration in [[Bergen]], Norway]]\nThe Constitution Day is celebrated in most small settlements and larger towns across Norway, with many variations.\n*In [[Oslo]], children from all the city's schools gather to parade past the Royal Palace, where they and the [[Norwegian Royal Family|Royal Family]] exchange waves and greetings.\n*In the municipality of [[Asker]], outside Oslo, the children gather outside the residence of the [[Haakon, Crown Prince of Norway|Crown Prince]] and [[Mette-Marit, Crown Princess of Norway|Princess]] at [[Skaugum]] Estate in the morning (giving the Prince and his family time to attend the parade in Oslo later in the day).\n*[[Bergen, Norway|Bergen]] has its own traditions for the parade, including comic troupes, various local organizations, a children's parade, and the unique [[buekorps]].\n*In [[Trondheim]], children from all the city's schools parade the streets of Trondheim in the morning. Later in the afternoon, the \"Citizens Parade\" (Borgertoget) starts. This is a parade where firefighters, sports teams, students associations and other associations are represented.\n*In [[Stavanger]] the day starts with a salute at 7 am. Later there are Children's Parade, Russ Parade and finally Citizens Parade. The British school has since the 1970s, later followed up by the Dutch school and the American school, carried flags from a number of countries from all over the world. An international party day is also arranged in the central Bjerkstedparken every May 17.\n*In [[Kristiansand]], in addition to parades of schoolchildren and citizens earlier that day, the city is known for the conclusion of the National Day with running through the city center (\"Tapto\") and spectacular [[fireworks]]. For those who want to continue the party until midnight, a [[trad jazz]] band with local touches plays until midnight in front of the [[Christiansholm Fortress]] (Free entrance).<ref>[https://www.kristiansand.kommune.no/globalassets/aktuelt/2017/program-may-17th-2017-english.pdf Program in City centre, City of Kristiansand May 17th 2017] {{in lang|en}}</ref>\n\nIn addition to the children's parades the streets across the country are filled with young and old, turning out in festive attire, and vendors selling ice cream, hot dogs, and lately, kebabs.\n\nIn many neighborhoods, small towns and villages, it is common to have their own events with easy dining and fun, unpretentious competitions for children.\n\nAlthough May 17 is the National Day, foreigners are welcome to join in with all activities.<ref name=\"n0517\" />\n\n==Celebration abroad==\n[[File:17MaiLutefisk2006-05-17.JPG|thumb|17 May dinner in the United States of [[lutefisk]], [[rutabaga]], [[Swedish meatballs|meatballs]], [[lingonberry jam]], and [[lefse]].]]\nSyttende Mai is also celebrated in many [[Norwegian-American|Norwegian immigrant communities]] throughout the world, with traditional foods, sometimes including [[lutefisk]].

Since 1969, the city of [[Westby, Wisconsin|Westby]] in western Wisconsin has celebrated a four-day festival featuring authentic Norwegian foods, crafts, a \"frokost\" and Norwegian church service.\n\nOther large celebrations are held in the [[Ballard, Seattle|Ballard]] neighborhood of [[Seattle]], Washington, (which also claims to be the largest Syttende Mai parade outside of Oslo)<ref name=\"Syttende Mai in Seattle\"/> [[Poulsbo, Washington]],<ref>[http://www.vikingfest.org/ Viking Fest Carnival], vikingfest.org</ref> and [[Bay Ridge, Brooklyn]].

The celebration is attended by a large number of Norwegians abroad and includes a small parade, a traditional service in the church, and the selling of traditional Norwegian foods such as ''Solo'' and ''makrell i tomat'', and a lot of Norwegian flags for Norwegians who have left theirs at home. \n\nIn [[Orkney]], Scotland, 17. May is celebrated by the Orkney Norway Friendship Association in recognition of the islands' strong historic links with Norway,<ref>[http://www.orkney.com/norway Orkney Norway Friendship Association], orkney.com</ref> with similar celebrations taking place in neighbouring [[Shetland]].\n\nIn [[Glasgow]], Scotland, the 17th of May is celebrated at Murano Street Student Village where Norwegian students and their friends congregate to enjoy the traditional festivities of the day. This includes the wearing of Norwegian traditional colours as well as the consumption of copious amounts of alcoholic beverages.\n\n[[Stockholm]], Sweden, has a big celebration with a parade starting at Engelbrektsplan and ending at [[Skansen]], in which more than 10,000 participate every year.

Actually, the day demonstrates that the children, i.e. the country's future, ''are'' the patriotic pride, if we follow Wergeland's thought. Flags and music dominate the day, and there are few military parades. To commemorate his contribution, the russ in Oslo place an oversized hat on his statue near the Norwegian [[Stortinget|parliament]]; the [[Jews in Norway|Jewish community]] place a [[wreath]] on his grave in the morning as a tribute to his efforts on their behalf.\n\n==Military participation==\n[[File:Garden 1.jpg|thumb|220px|The Royal Guard Norwegian Constitution Day parade]]\nThe [[Hans Majestet Kongens Garde|Royal Guard]] performs on the main street of the capital city, Oslo.

In the capital, for example, the children\u2019s parade passes the left side of the parliament building, and the president of parliament is allowed to wave to the passing parade from a small balcony,<ref>A funny side-note showing the low focus of elected government is the balcony the president of parliament is using: In the earlier days this was a small, temporary balcony added to one of the windows of the parliament building just before the National Day and removed afterwards. Prior to the parade the president of parliament must have carefully climbed out of the window and onto the balcony, while during the parade itself his mind must have switched between remembering to wave to the children parading and worrying if the balcony would fall down. Today the parliament building has a quite small, but permanent balcony that looks less likely to collapse.</ref> but the main focus of the parade is the Royal Palace and the Royal Family. The office of president of parliament is mainly ceremonial and administrative, often awarded in the later part of a political career. The prime minister and the rest of the ruling government on the other hand have no official duties during the celebrations.\n*The virtual lack of any military-centred celebration.\n\nOne can add that the day should be regarded as an expression of thankfulness, on behalf of the old values [[Freedom (political)|freedom]], [[egalitarianism|equality]] and brotherhood, the ideological basis for the constitution, and also on behalf of the circumstances that led up to the constitution. The aspect of \"thanksgiving\" in the national celebrations of Norway is easily forgotten in the long span of years from 1814.\n\nThere has been dispute over whether foreign flags should be allowed in the parade.
