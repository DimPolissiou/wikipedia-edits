According to Carey, \"[The] ''U.S. News'' ranking system is deeply flawed. Instead of focusing on the fundamental issues of how well colleges and universities educate their students and how well they prepare them to be successful after college, the magazine's rankings are almost entirely a function of three factors: fame, wealth, and exclusivity.\" He suggested more important characteristics are how well students are learning and how likely students are to earn a degree.<ref name=\"educationsector.org\">Carey, Kevin. \"College Rankings Reformed\".

In the category \"Faculty resources,\" even though few of us had significant changes in our faculty or student numbers, our class sizes, or our finances, the rankings' producers created a mad scramble in rank order [... data ...].  Then there is \"Financial resources,\" where Stanford dropped from #6 to #9, Harvard from #5 to #7. Our resources did not fall; did other institutions' rise so sharply?

The rankings were created in response to the finding in Science magazine which showed that among developed nations, the United States now provides the least economic opportunity and mobility for its citizens.  The rankings were also created to combat the rising costs of tuition, much of which is attributed to the efforts of some colleges to increase their own fame and wealth in ways that increase their rank in media periodicals that put an emphasis on such measures. In 2014, according to the SMI, the top five colleges are Montana Tech, Rowan University, Florida A&M, Cal Poly Pomona, and Cal State Northridge.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://socialmobilityindex.org/ |title=Social Mobility Index |publisher=CollegeNet and Payscale |accessdate=October 21, 2014}}</ref>\n\n===The Top American Research Universities===\n[[Center for Measuring University Performance|The Center for Measuring University Performance]] has ranked American research universities in the Top American Research Universities since 2000.

According to Carey, \"[The] ''U.S. News'' ranking system is deeply flawed. Instead of focusing on the fundamental issues of how well colleges and universities educate their students and how well they prepare them to be successful after college, the magazine's rankings are almost entirely a function of three factors: fame, wealth, and exclusivity.\" He suggested more important characteristics are how well students are learning and how likely students are to earn a degree.<ref name=\"educationsector.org\">Carey, Kevin. \"College Rankings Reformed\".

The peer survey is by nature [[Subjectivity|subjective]], but the technique of asking industry leaders to rate their competitors is a commonly accepted practice.

''U.S. News'' has been supplying this exact college information for many years already. And it appears that NAICU will be doing it with significantly less comparability and functionality.''U.S. News'' first collects all these data (using an agreed-upon set of definitions from the Common Data Set). Then we post the data on our website in easily accessible, comparable tables. In other words, the Annapolis Group and the others in the NAICU initiative actually are following the lead of ''U.S. News''.\"<ref name=autogenerated1 /></blockquote>\n\nIn 1996, according to [[Gerhard Casper]], then-president of [[Stanford University]], ''U.S. News & World Report'' changed its formula to calculated financial resources:\n\n<blockquote>Knowing that universities\u2014and, in most cases, the statistics they submit\u2014change little from one year to the next, I can only conclude that what are changing are the formulas the magazine's number massagers employ. And, indeed, there is marked evidence of that this year. In the category \"Faculty resources,\" even though few of us had significant changes in our faculty or student numbers, our class sizes, or our finances, the rankings' producers created a mad scramble in rank order [... data ...].  Then there is \"Financial resources,\" where Stanford dropped from #6 to #9, Harvard from #5 to #7. Our resources did not fall; did other institutions' rise so sharply?  I infer that, in each case, the formulas were simply changed, with notification to no one, not even your readers, who are left to assume that some schools have suddenly soared, others precipitously plummeted.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.stanford.edu/dept/pres-provost/president/speeches/961206gcfallow.html |title=Criticism of College Rankings \u2013 September 23, 1996 |publisher=Stanford.edu |date=1996-09-23|accessdate=2010-06-08}}</ref></blockquote>\n\n==See also==\n* [[College admissions in the United States]]\n* [[University and College Accountability Network]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|2}}\n\n==External links==\n* [http://sites.nationalacademies.org/PGA/Resdoc/ The National Academies Assessment of Research Doctorate Programs]\n\n{{University ranking systems}}\n\n[[Category:University and college rankings]]\n[[Category:Universities and colleges in the United States]]\n[[Category:University and college rankings in the United States|*]]\n", "name_user": "Andrewmoody71", "label": "safe", "comment": "", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rankings_of_universities_in_the_United_States"}

Senate and Assembly districts consisted of approximately the same number of inhabitants, the area being apportioned contiguously without restrictions regarding county boundaries.\n\nAt this time there were two major political parties: the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]] and the [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican Party]]. The [[Conservative Party of New York State|Conservative Party]], the [[New York State Right to Life Party|Right to Life Party]], the [[Liberal Party of New York|Liberal Party]], the [[New Alliance Party]], the [[Libertarian Party (United States)|Libertarian Party]], and the [[Socialist Workers Party (United States)|Socialist Workers Party]] also nominated tickets.\n\n==Elections==\nThe [[New York gubernatorial election, 1990|New York state election, 1990]], was held on November 6.  Governor [[Mario Cuomo]] and Lieutenant Governor [[Stan Lundine]] were re-elected, both Democrats. The elections to the other two statewide elective offices resulted in the re-election of the two incumbent officeholders: a Republican Comptroller, and a Democratic Attorney General. The approximate party strength at this election, as expressed by the vote for Governor, was: Democrats 2,086,000; Republicans 866,000; Conservatives 828,000; Right to Life 138,000; Liberals 71,000; New Alliance 31,000; Libertarians 25,000; and Socialist Workers 13,000.\n\n22 of the sitting 23 women members of the legislature\u2014State Senators [[Mary B.

Sullivan]] (Rep.), of [[Fulton, Oswego County, New York|Fulton]]; were also elected to the Assembly.\n\nThe New York state election, 1991, was held on November 5. Three vacancies in the Assembly were filled. Assemblywoman [[Helen M. Marshall]] was elected to the [[New York City Council]].\n\nOn January 28, 1992, [[Joni A. Yoswein]] (Dem.), of [[Brooklyn]], was elected to fill a vacancy in the Assembly. Thus the 189th Legislature began and ended with 28 women members, setting a new record.\n\n==Sessions==\nThe Legislature met for the first regular session (the 214th) at the State Capitol in [[Albany, New York|Albany]] on January 9, 1991;<ref>[https://www.nytimes.com/1991/01/10/nyregion/cuomo-prescribes-austerity-not-activism.html ''Cuomo Prescribes Austerity, Not Activism''] by Kevin Sack, in ''[[The New York Times]]'' on January 10, 1991</ref> and recessed indefinitely in the early morning of July 4.<ref>[https://www.nytimes.com/1991/07/05/nyregion/political-memo-cuomo-s-tax-shift-reflects-fiscal-squeeze.html ''Cuomo's Tax Shift Reflects Fiscal Squeeze''] by Kevin Sack, in ''The New York Times'' on July 5, 1991</ref>\n\n[[Mel Miller]] (Dem.) was re-elected [[Speaker of the New York State Assembly|Speaker of the Assembly]].\n\n[[Ralph J.
