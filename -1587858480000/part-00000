The [[American Civil War]] began in 1861. The 13th Amendment, effective December 1865, abolished slavery in the U.S.]]\nIn the United States before 1865, a '''slave state''' was a state in which [[Slavery in the United States#The slave trade|the slave trade]] was legal, while a '''free state''' was one in which it was not. There were enslaved persons in most free states in the 1840 census, and the [[Fugitive Slave Act of 1850]] specifically stated that an enslaved person remained enslaved even if their owner took them to a free state.\n\nHistorically, in the 18th century, slavery existed in all [[First British Empire|the British colonies]] of North America. In 1776, slavery was legal throughout the [[Thirteen Colonies]], when colonies started to abolish the legality of the practice. Pennsylvania abolished slavery in 1780, and about half the states abolished slavery during the [[American Revolutionary War|Revolutionary War]] or in the first decades of the new country. Although not one of the Thirteen Colonies, [[Vermont]] declared its independence from Britain in 1777 and at the same time abolished slavery, before being admitted as a state in 1791. Slavery became a very divisive issue and was a major issue during the writing of the U.S. Constitution, and slavery was the primary [[Origins of the American Civil War|cause of the American Civil War]]. Before the Civil War, there were 19 free states and 15 slave states. During the war slavery was abolished on some of these jurisdictions, and the [[Thirteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution]], ratified in December of 1865, finally abolished slavery throughout the United States.\n\nIn the [[District of Columbia (until 1871)|District of Columbia]], formed with land from two slave states, Maryland and Virginia, the trade was abolished by the [[Compromise of 1850]]. So as to avoid losing the profitable slave trading businesses in Alexandria (one was [[Franklin and Armfield]]), Alexandria County, D.C., requested that it be returned to Virginia, where the slave trade was legal; this took place in 1847. [[Slavery in the District of Columbia]] remained legal until 1862, when the walkout of all the Southern legislators permitted those remaining to pass the ban, which [[abolitionism in the United States|abolitionists]] had been seeking for decades.\n{{Slavery}}\n\n==Early history==\n[[File:US SlaveFree1789.gif|upright=1.40|right|thumb]]\n[[File:US SlaveFree1800.gif|upright=1.40|right|thumb]]\nHistorically, slavery as a legal institution in eastern North America began in [[English overseas possessions|the English colonies]] during the 17th and 18th centuries. [[Slavery in the colonial United States|Slavery in the colonial US]] was established in each of the [[Thirteen Colonies]]. During British colonization, the number of people in slavery expanded, primarily drawn from the [[Atlantic slave trade]].<ref>Betty Wood, ''Slavery in Colonial America, 1619\u20131776'' (2013) [https://www.amazon.com/Slavery-Colonial-1619-1776-American-ebook/dp/B00C0WEEUS/ excerpt and text search]</ref> Organized political and social movements to end slavery began in the mid-18th century.<ref name=\"Painter\">{{cite book|last=Painter|first=Nell Irvin|authorlink=Nell Irvin Painter|title=Creating Black Americans: African-American History and Its Meanings, 1619 to the Present|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=2006|pages=70\u201372|isbn=978-0195137569}}</ref> The sentiments of the [[American Revolution]] (1775-1783) and the equality evoked by the [[United States Declaration of Independence|Declaration of Independence]] stood in contrast to the status of most black Americans. Despite this, thousands of black Americans fought against the British in hopes of a new order. Thousands also joined the British army, encouraged by British offers of freedom in exchange for military service.<ref name=\"Painter\" /> (See [[Black Patriot]] and [[Black Loyalist]]).\n\nIn the 1770s, blacks throughout [[New England]] began sending petitions to northern legislatures demanding freedom. Five of the Northern self-declared states adopted policies to at least gradually abolish slavery: [[Pennsylvania]] in 1780, [[New Hampshire]] and [[Massachusetts]] in 1783, and [[Connecticut]] and [[Rhode Island]] in 1784. The [[Republic of Vermont]] had abolished slavery in 1777, while it was still independent before it joined the United States as the 14th state in 1791. These state jurisdictions thus enacted the first abolition laws in the [[Americas]].<ref>{{cite book |title= The Fiery Trial: Abraham Lincoln and American Slavery |publisher= W. W.

This sentiment, added to economic considerations, led to the immediate or gradual abolition of slavery in six Northern states, while there was a swelling flood of private [[manumission]]s in the South. Little actual gain was made by the free Negro even in this period, and by the turn of the century the downward trend had begun again. Thereafter the only important change in that trend before the Civil War was that after 1831 the decline in the status of the free Negro became more precipitate.\"</ref> although there were still hundreds of slaves in Northern \"free\" states as late as the [[1840]] census (see [[Slavery in the United States#Abolitionism in the North]]).\n\nIn the South, [[Kentucky]] was created a slave state from Virginia (1792), and [[Tennessee]] was created a slave state from [[North Carolina]] (1796). By 1804, before the creation of new states from the federal western territories, the number of slave and free states was 8 each. Beginning with the [[Missouri Compromise]] of 1820, the dividing line between the slave and free states was called the [[Mason-Dixon line]] (between [[Maryland]] and Pennsylvania).\n\nThe 1787 [[Constitutional Convention (United States)|Constitutional Convention]] debated slavery, and for a time slavery was a major impediment to passage of the new constitution. As a compromise, the institution was acknowledged though never mentioned directly in the constitution, as in the case of the [[Fugitive Slave Clause]]. The Constitution prohibited federal law ending slave importation, but in a compromise, the prohibition would be lifted in twenty years. [[Act Prohibiting Importation of Slaves|Legislation ending it]] passed easily in 1807, effective in 1808. However, the lack of imports spurred a compensatory expansion in the domestic (internal) commerce in slaves, which remained legal under federal law until 1865.\n[[File:US SlaveFree1821.gif |upright=1.40|right|thumb|The Missouri Compromise of 1820, trading the admission of Missouri (slave) for Maine (free), drew a line extending west from Missouri's southern border, which was intended to divide any new territory into slave (south of the line) and free (north of the line).]]\n==New territories==\n[[File: US SlaveFree1837.gif |upright=1.40 |right|thumb|With the statehood of Arkansas in 1836, the number of slave states grew to 13, but the statehood of Michigan in 1837 maintained the balance between slave and free states.]]\nThe [[Northwest Ordinance]] of 1787, passed just before the [[U.S. Constitution]] was ratified, had prohibited slavery in the federal [[Northwest Territory]]. The southern boundary of the territory was the [[Ohio River]], which was regarded as a westward extension of the Mason-Dixon line. The territory was generally settled by [[New England]]ers and [[American Revolutionary War]] veterans granted land there. The 6&nbsp;states created from the territory were all free states: [[Ohio]] (1803), [[Indiana]] (1816), [[Illinois]] (1818), [[Michigan]] (1837), [[Wisconsin]] (1848), and [[Minnesota]] (1858).\n\nDuring the [[War of 1812]], the British accepted as free all slaves who came into their hands, with no conditions as to military service such as had been made in [[Dunmore's Proclamation]] in the [[American Revolutionary War|Revolutionary War]]. By the end of the War of 1812, the momentum for antislavery reform, state by state, appeared to run out of steam, with half of the states having already abolished slavery ([[the Northeastern United States|Northeast]]), prohibited from the start ([[Midwest]]) or committed to eliminating slavery, and half committed to continuing the institution indefinitely ([[Southern United States|South]]).\n[[File: US SlaveFree1846 Wilmot.gif |upright=1.40 |right|thumb|By 1845, with Texas and Florida in the Union as slave states, slave states once again outnumbered the free states for a year until Iowa was admitted as a free state in 1846.]]\nThe potential for political conflict over slavery at a federal level made politicians concerned about the balance of power in the [[United States Senate]], where each State was represented by two Senators. With an equal number of slave states and free states, the Senate was equally divided on issues important to the South. As the population of the free states began to outstrip the population of the slave states, leading to control of the [[United States House of Representatives|House of Representatives]] by free states, the Senate became the preoccupation of slave-state politicians interested in maintaining a Congressional veto over federal policy in regard to slavery and other issues important to the South. As a result of this preoccupation, slave states and free states were often admitted into the Union in opposite pairs to maintain the existing Senate balance between slave and free states.\n[[File:US SlaveFree1858.gif |upright=1.40 |right|thumb|By 1858, 17 free states, which included Wisconsin (1848), California (1850), and Minnesota (1858), outnumbered the 15 slave states.]]\n===Missouri Compromise===\nControversy over whether [[Missouri]] should be admitted as a slave state resulted in the [[Missouri Compromise]] of 1820, which specified that [[Louisiana Purchase]] territory north of latitude 36\u00b0 30', which described most of Missouri's southern boundary, would be organized as free states and territory south of that line would be reserved for organization as slave states. As part of the compromise, the admission of [[Maine]] (1820) as a free state was enabled by  Missouri's compromise to join the union as a slave state (1820).\n\n===Texas and the Mexican Cession===\n{{Further|Wilmot Proviso}}\nThe admission of [[Texas]] (1845) and the acquisition of the vast new [[Mexican Cession]] territories (1848), after the [[Mexican\u2013American War]], created further North-South conflict. Although the settled portion of Texas was an area rich in cotton plantations and dependent on slave labor, the territory acquired in the Mountain West did not seem hospitable to cotton or slavery.\n\nAs part of the [[Compromise of 1850]], [[California]] was admitted as a free state without a slave state pair. To avoid creating a free state majority in the Senate, California agreed to send one pro-slavery and one anti-slavery senator to Congress.{{citation needed|date=July 2014}}\n\n===Last battles===\nThe difficulty of identifying territory that could be organized into additional slave states stalled the process of opening the western territories to settlement, while slave state politicians sought a solution, with efforts being made to acquire [[Cuba]] (see: [[Ostend Manifesto]], 1852) and to annex [[Nicaragua]] (see: [[Walker affair]], 1856\u201357), both to be slave states.\n\nIn 1854, the Missouri Compromise of 1820 was superseded by the [[Kansas\u2013Nebraska Act]], which allowed white male settlers in the new territories to determine through [[Popular sovereignty in the United States|popular sovereignty]] whether they would allow slavery within each territory. The result was that pro- and anti-slavery elements flooded into Kansas with the goal of voting slavery up or down, leading to [[Bleeding Kansas|bloody fighting]].<ref>Nicole Etcheson. ''Bleeding Kansas: Contested Liberty in the Civil War Era'' (2006). ch 1.</ref> An effort was initiated to organize [[Kansas]] for admission as a slave state, paired with [[Minnesota]], but the admission of Kansas as a slave state was blocked because of questions over the legitimacy of its [[Lecompton Constitution|slave state constitution]]. Anti-slavery proponents during the \"[[Bleeding Kansas]]\" era of the 1850s were called ''[[Free-Stater (Kansas)|Free-Staters]]'' and ''Free-Soilers'', and fought against [[Border Ruffians]] to combat pro-slavery supporters. The animosity escalated throughout the 1850's, culminating in numerous skirmishes and devastation on both sides of the border. Nevertheless, Free-Staters endured leading to the approval of Kansas to join the Union as a free state in 1861.\n\nWhen the admission of Minnesota proceeded unimpeded in 1858, the balance in the Senate was lost; a loss that was compounded by the subsequent admission of [[Oregon]] as a free state in 1859.\n\n===Slave and free state pairs===\nBefore 1812, the concern about balancing slave-states and free states was not deeply considered.

The new state would eventually incorporate 50 counties. The issue of slavery in the new state delayed approval of the bill. In the Senate [[Charles Sumner]] objected to the admission of a new slave state, while [[Benjamin Wade]] defended statehood as long as a gradual emancipation clause would be included in the new state constitution.<ref>James Oakes, ''Freedom National: The Destruction of Slavery in the United States, 1861\u20131865'', W.W. Norton, 2012, pgs. 296-97</ref> Two senators represented the Unionist Virginia government, [[John S. Carlile]] and [[Waitman T. Willey]]. Senator Carlile objected that Congress had no right to impose emancipation on [[West Virginia]], while Willey proposed a compromise amendment to the state constitution for gradual abolition. Sumner attempted to add his own amendment to the bill, which was defeated, and the statehood bill passed both houses of Congress with the addition of what became known as the Willey Amendment. President Lincoln signed the bill on December 31, 1862.

Two additional counties were added to West Virginia in late 1863, [[Berkeley County, West Virginia|Berkeley]] and [[Jefferson County, West Virginia|Jefferson]]. The slaves in Berkeley were also under exemption but not those in Jefferson County.

The [[American Civil War]] began in 1861. The 13th Amendment, effective December 1865, abolished slavery in the U.S.]]\nIn the United States before 1865, a '''slave state''' was a state in which [[Slavery in the United States#The slave trade|the slave trade]] was legal, while a '''free state''' was one in which it was not. There were enslaved persons in most free states in the 1840 census, and the [[Fugitive Slave Act of 1850]] specifically stated that an enslaved person remained enslaved even if their owner took them to a free state.\n\nHistorically, in the 18th century, slavery existed in all [[First British Empire|the British colonies]] of North America. In 1776, slavery was legal throughout the [[Thirteen Colonies]], when colonies started to abolish the legality of the practice. Pennsylvania abolished slavery in 1780, and about half the states abolished slavery during the [[American Revolutionary War|Revolutionary War]] or in the first decades of the new country. Although not one of the Thirteen Colonies, [[Vermont]] declared its independence from Britain in 1777 and at the same time abolished slavery, before being admitted as a state in 1791. Slavery became a very divisive issue and was a major issue during the writing of the U.S. Constitution, and slavery was the primary [[Origins of the American Civil War|cause of the American Civil War]]. Before the Civil War, there were 19 free states and 15 slave states. During the war slavery was abolished on some of these jurisdictions, and the [[Thirteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution]], ratified in December of 1865, finally abolished slavery throughout the United States.\n\nIn the [[District of Columbia (until 1871)|District of Columbia]], formed with land from two slave states, Maryland and Virginia, the trade was abolished by the [[Compromise of 1850]]. So as to avoid losing the profitable slave trading businesses in Alexandria (one was [[Franklin and Armfield]]), Alexandria County, D.C., requested that it be returned to Virginia, where the slave trade was legal; this took place in 1847. [[Slavery in the District of Columbia]] remained legal until 1862, when the walkout of all the Southern legislators permitted those remaining to pass the ban, which [[abolitionism in the United States|abolitionists]] had been seeking for decades.\n{{Slavery}}\n\n==Early history==\n[[File:US SlaveFree1789.gif|upright=1.40|right|thumb]]\n[[File:US SlaveFree1800.gif|upright=1.40|right|thumb]]\nHistorically, slavery as a legal institution in eastern North America began in [[English overseas possessions|the English colonies]] during the 17th and 18th centuries. [[Slavery in the colonial United States|Slavery in the colonial US]] was established in each of the [[Thirteen Colonies]]. During British colonization, the number of people in slavery expanded, primarily drawn from the [[Atlantic slave trade]].<ref>Betty Wood, ''Slavery in Colonial America, 1619\u20131776'' (2013) [https://www.amazon.com/Slavery-Colonial-1619-1776-American-ebook/dp/B00C0WEEUS/ excerpt and text search]</ref> Organized political and social movements to end slavery began in the mid-18th century.<ref name=\"Painter\">{{cite book|last=Painter|first=Nell Irvin|authorlink=Nell Irvin Painter|title=Creating Black Americans: African-American History and Its Meanings, 1619 to the Present|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=2006|pages=70\u201372|isbn=978-0195137569}}</ref> The sentiments of the [[American Revolution]] (1775-1783) and the equality evoked by the [[United States Declaration of Independence|Declaration of Independence]] stood in contrast to the status of most black Americans. Despite this, thousands of black Americans fought against the British in hopes of a new order. Thousands also joined the British army, encouraged by British offers of freedom in exchange for military service.<ref name=\"Painter\" /> (See [[Black Patriot]] and [[Black Loyalist]]).\n\nIn the 1770s, blacks throughout [[New England]] began sending petitions to northern legislatures demanding freedom. Five of the Northern self-declared states adopted policies to at least gradually abolish slavery: [[Pennsylvania]] in 1780, [[New Hampshire]] and [[Massachusetts]] in 1783, and [[Connecticut]] and [[Rhode Island]] in 1784. The [[Republic of Vermont]] had abolished slavery in 1777, while it was still independent before it joined the United States as the 14th state in 1791. These state jurisdictions thus enacted the first abolition laws in the [[Americas]].<ref>{{cite book |title= The Fiery Trial: Abraham Lincoln and American Slavery |publisher= W. W.

This sentiment, added to economic considerations, led to the immediate or gradual abolition of slavery in six Northern states, while there was a swelling flood of private [[manumission]]s in the South. Little actual gain was made by the free Negro even in this period, and by the turn of the century the downward trend had begun again. Thereafter the only important change in that trend before the Civil War was that after 1831 the decline in the status of the free Negro became more precipitate.\"</ref> although there were still hundreds of slaves in Northern \"free\" states as late as the [[1840]] census (see [[Slavery in the United States#Abolitionism in the North]]).\n\nIn the South, [[Kentucky]] was created a slave state from Virginia (1792), and [[Tennessee]] was created a slave state from [[North Carolina]] (1796). By 1804, before the creation of new states from the federal western territories, the number of slave and free states was 8 each. Beginning with the [[Missouri Compromise]] of 1820, the dividing line between the slave and free states was called the [[Mason-Dixon line]] (between [[Maryland]] and Pennsylvania).\n\nThe 1787 [[Constitutional Convention (United States)|Constitutional Convention]] debated slavery, and for a time slavery was a major impediment to passage of the new constitution. As a compromise, the institution was acknowledged though never mentioned directly in the constitution, as in the case of the [[Fugitive Slave Clause]]. The Constitution prohibited federal law ending slave importation, but in a compromise, the prohibition would be lifted in twenty years. [[Act Prohibiting Importation of Slaves|Legislation ending it]] passed easily in 1807, effective in 1808. However, the lack of imports spurred a compensatory expansion in the domestic (internal) commerce in slaves, which remained legal under federal law until 1865.\n[[File:US SlaveFree1821.gif |upright=1.40|right|thumb|The Missouri Compromise of 1820, trading the admission of Missouri (slave) for Maine (free), drew a line extending west from Missouri's southern border, which was intended to divide any new territory into slave (south of the line) and free (north of the line).]]\n==New territories==\n[[File: US SlaveFree1837.gif |upright=1.40 |right|thumb|With the statehood of Arkansas in 1836, the number of slave states grew to 13, but the statehood of Michigan in 1837 maintained the balance between slave and free states.]]\nThe [[Northwest Ordinance]] of 1787, passed just before the [[U.S. Constitution]] was ratified, had prohibited slavery in the federal [[Northwest Territory]]. The southern boundary of the territory was the [[Ohio River]], which was regarded as a westward extension of the Mason-Dixon line. The territory was generally settled by [[New England]]ers and [[American Revolutionary War]] veterans granted land there. The 6&nbsp;states created from the territory were all free states: [[Ohio]] (1803), [[Indiana]] (1816), [[Illinois]] (1818), [[Michigan]] (1837), [[Wisconsin]] (1848), and [[Minnesota]] (1858).\n\nDuring the [[War of 1812]], the British accepted as free all slaves who came into their hands, with no conditions as to military service such as had been made in [[Dunmore's Proclamation]] in the [[American Revolutionary War|Revolutionary War]]. By the end of the War of 1812, the momentum for antislavery reform, state by state, appeared to run out of steam, with half of the states having already abolished slavery ([[the Northeastern United States|Northeast]]), prohibited from the start ([[Midwest]]) or committed to eliminating slavery, and half committed to continuing the institution indefinitely ([[Southern United States|South]]).\n[[File: US SlaveFree1846 Wilmot.gif |upright=1.40 |right|thumb|By 1845, with Texas and Florida in the Union as slave states, slave states once again outnumbered the free states for a year until Iowa was admitted as a free state in 1846.]]\nThe potential for political conflict over slavery at a federal level made politicians concerned about the balance of power in the [[United States Senate]], where each State was represented by two Senators. With an equal number of slave states and free states, the Senate was equally divided on issues important to the South. As the population of the free states began to outstrip the population of the slave states, leading to control of the [[United States House of Representatives|House of Representatives]] by free states, the Senate became the preoccupation of slave-state politicians interested in maintaining a Congressional veto over federal policy in regard to slavery and other issues important to the South. As a result of this preoccupation, slave states and free states were often admitted into the Union in opposite pairs to maintain the existing Senate balance between slave and free states.\n[[File:US SlaveFree1858.gif |upright=1.40 |right|thumb|By 1858, 17 free states, which included Wisconsin (1848), California (1850), and Minnesota (1858), outnumbered the 15 slave states.]]\n===Missouri Compromise===\nControversy over whether [[Missouri]] should be admitted as a slave state resulted in the [[Missouri Compromise]] of 1820, which specified that [[Louisiana Purchase]] territory north of latitude 36\u00b0 30', which described most of Missouri's southern boundary, would be organized as free states and territory south of that line would be reserved for organization as slave states. As part of the compromise, the admission of [[Maine]] (1820) as a free state was enabled by  Missouri's compromise to join the union as a slave state (1820).\n\n===Texas and the Mexican Cession===\n{{Further|Wilmot Proviso}}\nThe admission of [[Texas]] (1845) and the acquisition of the vast new [[Mexican Cession]] territories (1848), after the [[Mexican\u2013American War]], created further North-South conflict. Although the settled portion of Texas was an area rich in cotton plantations and dependent on slave labor, the territory acquired in the Mountain West did not seem hospitable to cotton or slavery.\n\nAs part of the [[Compromise of 1850]], [[California]] was admitted as a free state without a slave state pair. To avoid creating a free state majority in the Senate, California agreed to send one pro-slavery and one anti-slavery senator to Congress.{{citation needed|date=July 2014}}\n\n===Last battles===\nThe difficulty of identifying territory that could be organized into additional slave states stalled the process of opening the western territories to settlement, while slave state politicians sought a solution, with efforts being made to acquire [[Cuba]] (see: [[Ostend Manifesto]], 1852) and to annex [[Nicaragua]] (see: [[Walker affair]], 1856\u201357), both to be slave states.\n\nIn 1854, the Missouri Compromise of 1820 was superseded by the [[Kansas\u2013Nebraska Act]], which allowed white male settlers in the new territories to determine through [[Popular sovereignty in the United States|popular sovereignty]] whether they would allow slavery within each territory. The result was that pro- and anti-slavery elements flooded into Kansas with the goal of voting slavery up or down, leading to [[Bleeding Kansas|bloody fighting]].<ref>Nicole Etcheson. ''Bleeding Kansas: Contested Liberty in the Civil War Era'' (2006). ch 1.</ref> An effort was initiated to organize [[Kansas]] for admission as a slave state, paired with [[Minnesota]], but the admission of Kansas as a slave state was blocked because of questions over the legitimacy of its [[Lecompton Constitution|slave state constitution]]. Anti-slavery proponents during the \"[[Bleeding Kansas]]\" era of the 1850s were called ''[[Free-Stater (Kansas)|Free-Staters]]'' and ''Free-Soilers'', and fought against [[Border Ruffians]] to combat pro-slavery supporters. The animosity escalated throughout the 1850's, culminating in numerous skirmishes and devastation on both sides of the border. Nevertheless, Free-Staters endured leading to the approval of Kansas to join the Union as a free state in 1861.\n\nWhen the admission of Minnesota proceeded unimpeded in 1858, the balance in the Senate was lost; a loss that was compounded by the subsequent admission of [[Oregon]] as a free state in 1859.\n\n===Slave and free state pairs===\nBefore 1812, the concern about balancing slave-states and free states was not deeply considered.

The new state would eventually incorporate 50 counties. The issue of slavery in the new state delayed approval of the bill. In the Senate [[Charles Sumner]] objected to the admission of a new slave state, while [[Benjamin Wade]] defended statehood as long as a gradual emancipation clause would be included in the new state constitution.<ref>James Oakes, ''Freedom National: The Destruction of Slavery in the United States, 1861\u20131865'', W.W. Norton, 2012, pgs. 296-97</ref> Two senators represented the Unionist Virginia government, [[John S. Carlile]] and [[Waitman T. Willey]]. Senator Carlile objected that Congress had no right to impose emancipation on [[West Virginia]], while Willey proposed a compromise amendment to the state constitution for gradual abolition. Sumner attempted to add his own amendment to the bill, which was defeated, and the statehood bill passed both houses of Congress with the addition of what became known as the Willey Amendment.

Though presumed set in the continuity of the 2004 reboot, the visuals were based on the designs of the original 1978 series and like the original series, the game featured alien races and their technologies even though no aliens or alien technologies were ever suggested to exist in the 2004 continuity. The game also features the voice talents of [[Dirk Benedict]] as Lieutenant Starbuck and Richard Hatch as Captain Apollo, though both characters were hidden content available only through the use of cheat codes and did not feature in the storyline of the main game.

The Cylons evolved. The Cylons Rebelled. The game begins 40 years after the first Cylon war. The Cylons paid a visit to the Twelve Colonies to annihilate the humans and take their resources. The aging Battlestar Galactica managed to escape the attack, gather a fleet of civilian ships, and set out for the home of the legendary 13th Colony (Earth). The Cylons pursued Battlestar Galactica for months until Battlestar Galactica reunited with Pegasus, the other survivor from the Cylon attack. Together, they were strong enough to retaliate and destroy the Cylon's Resurrection Ship.\n\nWhen the Cylons discovered that the humans destroyed the Resurrection Ship, they launched a colossal counter strike against the Colonial Fleet. The unsuspecting Colonials were forced to jump away to safety, but they suffered a mechanical malfunction in the process. A massive pulse of energy overloaded the FTL drives on both fleets, which triggered an uncontrolled jump that threw them off target.\n\nIn Battlestar Galactica Online, the Cylons and Colonials are stranded at the edge of one of the galactic arms. Both Colonial fleets are heavily damaged and low on critical resources. The race begins for the Colonials to repair and rearm their ships, escape and continue their quest for Earth before the Cylons gain enough strength to obliterate them once and for all.\n\n====Battlestar Galactica Deadlock (2017)====\nBattlestar Galactica Deadlock is a 3D strategy game (released on PC, Xbox One and PS4) featuring the First Cylon War. The game is developed by the Australian studio Black Lab Games and published by the British developer [[Slitherine Software]]. It was originally announced on May 16, 2017 and it opened its closed beta shortly after.<ref>http://slitherine.com/news/2240/Battlestar.Galactica.Deadlock.is.announced! Battlestar Galactica Deadlock is announced!, May 16, 2017, Slitherine.com</ref>\n\nBattlestar Galactica Deadlock takes the player into the heart of the First Cylon War, to fight 3D battles. The player takes control of the Colonial Fleet from the bridge of the mobile shipyard, Daidalos, and free the Twelve Colonies from the Cylon threat.\n\nSince the release of the game in August 31, 2017, the game has had 4 releases of DLC content to expand the content of the game. The first DLC introduced additional ships and weapons while the remaining three DLCs added additional ships, new locations, terrain, and new story missions that occur during and after the main game.\n\nWith the release of the Sin and Sacrifice DLC on March 19, 2019, the creators of Battlestar Galactica Deadlock have announced the end of \"Season 1\" of the game series and a new DLC titled Battlestar Galactica Deadlock: Resurrection which starts season 2, was released on August 29, 2019.\n\n===Fan-made games===\n\n====BSG: Beyond the Red Line====\nA fan made total conversion for ''[[FreeSpace 2]]'' known as ''[[Beyond the Red Line]]'' had a demo version released on March 31, 2007.

Many have been centered on the rag-tag fleet theme and usually provide themed events, Viper vs. Raider dogfights, and general combat.\n\n=====Currently active=====\nBattlestar: Thesis (BSG-82nd) was created by a new team of BSG fans and running under the fair trade rule set by Universal Studios to use BSG content in Second Life. The story is set in the Second Cylon War but with the idea that the colonies didn't fall but survived, with the goal of expanding the BSG universe. The ships and fighters are based on the RDM Series all Mesh build and the sim features the colonial 82nd Recon Fleet consisting of the Battlestar Thesis, Stealth Gunstar Aeon, Heavy Gunstar Cerberus, Support Gunstar Sirius. The Cylon fleet contains the Warstar Cylonica, Strikestar Regen, Strikestar Relic, Cylonbase and Djerba Outpost. BSG 82 RP Sim has a [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-T-8FVKN1pU promotional video] to show what the sim offers. The sim started in 2011 and is still open today. It is called Sniper Eye: Battlestar Thesis.\n\n=====Closed / inactive=====\n\nUntil December, 2010, there were several active sims based on the Re-imagined Series, with several more under development.  These were:\n\nBattlestar Pacifica (BSG-47): The Columbia Class Pacifica was the first of the sims based on the series. It opened in 2007 and was the oldest of the sims that were active as of December, 2010. The Sim restarted their story, having completed their storyline in December 2009. The sim featured a number of ships seen in both series, including a version of the Celestra. As of August 2012, this sim is closed.\n\nBattlestar Mercury (BSG-21): In May 2008, The Battlestar Mercury sim opened and was created by former members of the Pacifica sim. The Mercury, a Mercury Class Battlestar similar to the Pegasus, featured the signature double sided landing decks, which allowed participating residents to land their ship upside down. In January 2010, the Mercury concluded their first story and following a restructure of their leadership, began a new story, this one centered on an original story concept inspired by a prop painting that hung in Commander Adama's quarters. However, as of January, 2011, the second story line was suspended and scrapped due to the situation with [[NBCUniversal]] (see below) and began their third story. Like their predecessor, the Mercury sim also featured ships from the Reimagined series, including a version of the Zephyr.    \nAs of August 2012, this sim was closed, however, in December 2012, the owners of the sim announced a new, unique version of the Galactica Story called Battlestar Mercury: New Genesis. the story, set 150,000 years after the end of the reimagined series, on modern day Earth, combines elements of the Galactica story and a Hunger Games-style environment that promises to take the story into a new direction unique to the genre. On November 5, 2014, the owners of the Mercury sim, citing the ongoing erosion of interest in the genre, announced the sim's impending closure after six years of existence ([https://web.archive.org/web/20131217145503/http://battlestarmercury.com/wordpress/ Official Website])\n\nBattlestar Universe (BSG-33): Currently inactive.  In September 2009, the Columbia Class Battlestar Olympia opened their story. Unlike their predecessors, The Olympia sim was set during the first Cylon War.  Several months ago, Battlestar Universe closed their doors and the sim on which play occurred was sold. In early 2011 former owners of the original BSG-33 attempted to revive their project with a slightly changed concept on a homestead instead of a full sim. As of August 2012, this sim is closed.\n\nBattlestar: The Twelve Colonies (BSG-118):  In January 2010, this particular BSG sim opened featuring a pre-Cylon attack cityscape as well as a new, non-canon class of Battlestar, the Phoenix. This particular sim differed from others in that when the Cylon attacks occur, the Twelve Colonies were not completely lost, resulting in expanded roleplay potential located on the various Colonies themselves.  Set partially in Caprica City, the city contained familiar sets from the series, including the Riverwalk Market and other notable landmarks.  This sim closed after Universal Studios' actions against Battlestar Galactica themes in Second Life, but as of August 2012, part of its former administrative team is now working on a new project called Battlestar: Resurrection.\n\nBSG: Exodus (BSG-104): Following a new concept and original story using the re-imagined series as a backdrop, this sim began construction when disputes over owner conduct, fragmented the BSG47 sim for the third time.  This sim closed in mid-2012 for reasons unrelated to NBCUniversal's DMCA against Battlestar Galactica intellectual property in Second Life.\n\n=====NBCUniversal controversy=====\nAlthough the number of sims have paled in comparison to the [[Star Trek]] and [[Star Wars]] sims in Second Life, there has been a very dedicated following amongst them. However, in July 2010, [[NBCUniversal]] began efforts to have the sims removed from Second Life by claiming an intellectual property infringement by both individual creators and Linden Labs for hosting such work. The initial campaign moved to stop the sale of items such as flyable ships and uniforms from the series made available to residents of second life by a number of vendors, not necessarily related to the sims.  Despite the efforts of the various BSG themed sims, Universal began demands that the sims cease and desist using their trademarked images and content in their role-play sims. By December 7, 2010, the majority of the sims had either shut down or changed their content and storylines away from that in the series.\n\nExodus, a newcomer in the BSG fan roleplay world staffed by longtime members of the community, took up the cause and recruited Anthony Hasledge of the 'IFT Sci-Fi Alliance', to open dialogue with licensing executives and resolve the trademark issue. Other former and current BSG sim owners joined the effort, as did players from every quarter of the BSG roleplay community. Their efforts were successful and, so long as the BSG sims in Second Life comply with a set of rules including no sale of any products related to BSG, they are allowed to continue. As of February 5, 2011, Universal has allowed fair-use of intellectual property related to Battlestar Galactica.\n\nIn April, 2011, an announcement was released that the Exodus and Twelve Colonies, who had changed their name to the Tocana Colonies after the controversy, had agreed to a merger that would take place as of April 8, 2011. However, it was later revealed to be an [[April Fools' Day|April Fool's Day]] Hoax.\n\n===Fan-made game mods===\n[[Mod (computer gaming)|Game modifications]] of various games have been made.\n\n====BSG: Fleet Commander====\n''Battlestar Galactica: Fleet Commander'' is a ''[[Homeworld 2]]'' total conversion. Beta versions of ''BSG: Fleet Commander'' are available for Windows and the Macintosh.

The mod is set to be completed under a new name, [http://www.moddb.com/mods/battlestar-galactica-at-war ''Battlestar Galactica: At War'']. This uses the same concept for the game, and is set to totally convert Star Wars: Empire at War into Battlestar Galactica. Sadly this mod ceased development and is no longer available.

Though presumed set in the continuity of the 2004 reboot, the visuals were based on the designs of the original 1978 series and like the original series, the game featured alien races and their technologies even though no aliens or alien technologies were ever suggested to exist in the 2004 continuity. The game also features the voice talents of Dirk Benedict as Lieutenant Starbuck and Richard Hatch as Captain Apollo, though both characters were hidden content available only through the use of cheat codes and did not feature in the storyline of the main game. It was developed by [[Warthog Games]] and it was the last game ever to be published by [[Universal Interactive]], as the company would dissolve shortly after the game's release.\n\n=== Others ===\nIn 1976, [[Mattel]] released a handheld electronic game called \"Missile Attack\", which was later resold as \"''Battlestar Galactica Space Alert''\" due to difficulties with [[NBC]] who refused to air commercials for the Missile Attack game.

The Cylons evolved. The Cylons Rebelled. The game begins 40 years after the first Cylon war. The Cylons paid a visit to the Twelve Colonies to annihilate the humans and take their resources. The aging Battlestar Galactica managed to escape the attack, gather a fleet of civilian ships, and set out for the home of the legendary 13th Colony (Earth). The Cylons pursued Battlestar Galactica for months until Battlestar Galactica reunited with Pegasus, the other survivor from the Cylon attack. Together, they were strong enough to retaliate and destroy the Cylon's Resurrection Ship.\n\nWhen the Cylons discovered that the humans destroyed the Resurrection Ship, they launched a colossal counter strike against the Colonial Fleet. The unsuspecting Colonials were forced to jump away to safety, but they suffered a mechanical malfunction in the process. A massive pulse of energy overloaded the FTL drives on both fleets, which triggered an uncontrolled jump that threw them off target.\n\nIn Battlestar Galactica Online, the Cylons and Colonials are stranded at the edge of one of the galactic arms. Both Colonial fleets are heavily damaged and low on critical resources. The race begins for the Colonials to repair and rearm their ships, escape and continue their quest for Earth before the Cylons gain enough strength to obliterate them once and for all.\n\n====Battlestar Galactica Deadlock (2017)====\nBattlestar Galactica Deadlock is a 3D strategy game (released on PC, Xbox One and PS4) featuring the First Cylon War. The game is developed by the Australian studio Black Lab Games and published by the British developer [[Slitherine Software]]. It was originally announced on May 16, 2017 and it opened its closed beta shortly after.<ref>http://slitherine.com/news/2240/Battlestar.Galactica.Deadlock.is.announced! Battlestar Galactica Deadlock is announced!, May 16, 2017, Slitherine.com</ref>\n\nBattlestar Galactica Deadlock takes the player into the heart of the First Cylon War, to fight 3D battles. The player takes control of the Colonial Fleet from the bridge of the mobile shipyard, Daidalos, and free the Twelve Colonies from the Cylon threat.\n\nSince the release of the game in August 31, 2017, the game has had 4 releases of DLC content to expand the content of the game. The first DLC introduced additional ships and weapons while the remaining three DLCs added additional ships, new locations, terrain, and new story missions that occur during and after the main game.\n\nWith the release of the Sin and Sacrifice DLC on March 19, 2019, the creators of Battlestar Galactica Deadlock have announced the end of \"Season 1\" of the game series and a new DLC titled Battlestar Galactica Deadlock: Resurrection which starts season 2, was released on August 29, 2019.\n\n===Fan-made games===\n\n====BSG: Beyond the Red Line====\nA fan made total conversion for ''[[FreeSpace 2]]'' known as ''[[Beyond the Red Line]]'' had a demo version released on March 31, 2007.

It has also been updated to allow third-party campaigns, of which there are currently two.\n\n====Diaspora====\nA fan game based on the open source ''[[FreeSpace 2 Source Code Project|FreeSpace 2 engine]]'' known as ''Diaspora'' began development in May 2008 and was released in September, 2012. It was begun by the majority of the members of the ''[[Beyond the Red Line]]'' team, who split off due to creative and management differences.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.diaspora-game.com/faq.html |title=diaspora-game.com |publisher=diaspora-game.com |accessdate=January 3, 2012 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120218141053/http://www.diaspora-game.com/faq.html |archivedate=February 18, 2012 }}</ref> ([http://www.diasporagame.com Official Website])\n\n====Battlestar Galactica in Second life====\nAs well with other popular scifi shows, there have been several Battlestar Galactica themed sims (simulators) in [[Second Life]]. Many have been centered on the rag-tag fleet theme and usually provide themed events, Viper vs. Raider dogfights, and general combat.\n\n=====Currently active=====\nBattlestar: Thesis (BSG-82nd) was created by a new team of BSG fans and running under the fair trade rule set by Universal Studios to use BSG content in Second Life. The story is set in the Second Cylon War but with the idea that the colonies didn't fall but survived, with the goal of expanding the BSG universe. The ships and fighters are based on the RDM Series all Mesh build and the sim features the colonial 82nd Recon Fleet consisting of the Battlestar Thesis, Stealth Gunstar Aeon, Heavy Gunstar Cerberus, Support Gunstar Sirius. The Cylon fleet contains the Warstar Cylonica, Strikestar Regen, Strikestar Relic, Cylonbase and Djerba Outpost. BSG 82 RP Sim has a [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-T-8FVKN1pU promotional video] to show what the sim offers. The sim started in 2011 and is still open today. It is called Sniper Eye: Battlestar Thesis.\n\n=====Closed / inactive=====\n\nUntil December, 2010, there were several active sims based on the Re-imagined Series, with several more under development.  These were:\n\nBattlestar Pacifica (BSG-47): The Columbia Class Pacifica was the first of the sims based on the series. It opened in 2007 and was the oldest of the sims that were active as of December, 2010. The Sim restarted their story, having completed their storyline in December 2009. The sim featured a number of ships seen in both series, including a version of the Celestra. As of August 2012, this sim is closed.\n\nBattlestar Mercury (BSG-21): In May 2008, The Battlestar Mercury sim opened and was created by former members of the Pacifica sim. The Mercury, a Mercury Class Battlestar similar to the Pegasus, featured the signature double sided landing decks, which allowed participating residents to land their ship upside down. In January 2010, the Mercury concluded their first story and following a restructure of their leadership, began a new story, this one centered on an original story concept inspired by a prop painting that hung in Commander Adama's quarters. However, as of January, 2011, the second story line was suspended and scrapped due to the situation with [[NBCUniversal]] (see below) and began their third story. Like their predecessor, the Mercury sim also featured ships from the Reimagined series, including a version of the Zephyr.    \nAs of August 2012, this sim was closed, however, in December 2012, the owners of the sim announced a new, unique version of the Galactica Story called Battlestar Mercury: New Genesis. the story, set 150,000 years after the end of the reimagined series, on modern day Earth, combines elements of the Galactica story and a Hunger Games-style environment that promises to take the story into a new direction unique to the genre. On November 5, 2014, the owners of the Mercury sim, citing the ongoing erosion of interest in the genre, announced the sim's impending closure after six years of existence ([https://web.archive.org/web/20131217145503/http://battlestarmercury.com/wordpress/ Official Website])\n\nBattlestar Universe (BSG-33): Currently inactive.  In September 2009, the Columbia Class Battlestar Olympia opened their story. Unlike their predecessors, The Olympia sim was set during the first Cylon War.  Several months ago, Battlestar Universe closed their doors and the sim on which play occurred was sold. In early 2011 former owners of the original BSG-33 attempted to revive their project with a slightly changed concept on a homestead instead of a full sim. As of August 2012, this sim is closed.\n\nBattlestar: The Twelve Colonies (BSG-118):  In January 2010, this particular BSG sim opened featuring a pre-Cylon attack cityscape as well as a new, non-canon class of Battlestar, the Phoenix. This particular sim differed from others in that when the Cylon attacks occur, the Twelve Colonies were not completely lost, resulting in expanded roleplay potential located on the various Colonies themselves.  Set partially in Caprica City, the city contained familiar sets from the series, including the Riverwalk Market and other notable landmarks.  This sim closed after Universal Studios' actions against Battlestar Galactica themes in Second Life, but as of August 2012, part of its former administrative team is now working on a new project called Battlestar: Resurrection.\n\nBSG: Exodus (BSG-104): Following a new concept and original story using the re-imagined series as a backdrop, this sim began construction when disputes over owner conduct, fragmented the BSG47 sim for the third time.  This sim closed in mid-2012 for reasons unrelated to NBCUniversal's DMCA against Battlestar Galactica intellectual property in Second Life.\n\n=====NBCUniversal controversy=====\nAlthough the number of sims have paled in comparison to the [[Star Trek]] and [[Star Wars]] sims in Second Life, there has been a very dedicated following amongst them. However, in July 2010, [[NBCUniversal]] began efforts to have the sims removed from Second Life by claiming an intellectual property infringement by both individual creators and Linden Labs for hosting such work. The initial campaign moved to stop the sale of items such as flyable ships and uniforms from the series made available to residents of second life by a number of vendors, not necessarily related to the sims.  Despite the efforts of the various BSG themed sims, Universal began demands that the sims cease and desist using their trademarked images and content in their role-play sims. By December 7, 2010, the majority of the sims had either shut down or changed their content and storylines away from that in the series.\n\nExodus, a newcomer in the BSG fan roleplay world staffed by longtime members of the community, took up the cause and recruited Anthony Hasledge of the 'IFT Sci-Fi Alliance', to open dialogue with licensing executives and resolve the trademark issue. Other former and current BSG sim owners joined the effort, as did players from every quarter of the BSG roleplay community. Their efforts were successful and, so long as the BSG sims in Second Life comply with a set of rules including no sale of any products related to BSG, they are allowed to continue. As of February 5, 2011, Universal has allowed fair-use of intellectual property related to Battlestar Galactica.\n\nIn April, 2011, an announcement was released that the Exodus and Twelve Colonies, who had changed their name to the Tocana Colonies after the controversy, had agreed to a merger that would take place as of April 8, 2011. However, it was later revealed to be an [[April Fools' Day|April Fool's Day]] Hoax.\n\n===Fan-made game mods===\n[[Mod (computer gaming)|Game modifications]] of various games have been made.\n\n====BSG: Fleet Commander====\n''Battlestar Galactica: Fleet Commander'' is a ''[[Homeworld 2]]'' total conversion. Beta versions of ''BSG: Fleet Commander'' are available for Windows and the Macintosh. This is a [[real-time strategy]] game in which players command human or Cylon fleets from both the original series and the 2003 reimagined version of the series.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.battlestarmod.com/ |title=BSG: Fleet Commander |publisher=Battlestarmod.com |accessdate=January 3, 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120217004738/http://www.battlestarmod.com/ |archive-date=February 17, 2012 |url-status=dead }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.hw2bsg.org |title=Fleet Commander Development forum |publisher=Hw2bsg.org |accessdate=January 3, 2012}}</ref> It has been mentioned by many gaming publications.

The mod is set to be completed under a new name, [http://www.moddb.com/mods/battlestar-galactica-at-war ''Battlestar Galactica: At War''].

The two finalists face off for gold and silver medals. Each wrestler who loses to one of the two finalists moves into the repechage, culminating in a pair of bronze medal matches featuring the semifinal losers each facing the remaining repechage opponent from their half of the bracket.\n\nEach bout consists of up to three rounds, lasting two minutes apiece. The wrestler who scores more points in each round is the winner of that rounds; the bout ends when one wrestler has won two rounds (and thus the match).\n\n==Schedule==\n<small>All times are [[British

[[freestyle wrestling]] competition consists of a single-elimination tournament, with a [[repechage]] used to determine the winner of two bronze medals. The two finalists face off for gold and silver medals. Each wrestler who loses to one of the two finalists moves into the repechage, culminating in a pair of bronze medal matches featuring the semifinal losers each facing the remaining repechage opponent from their half of the bracket.\n\nEach bout consists of up to three rounds, lasting two minutes apiece. The wrestler who scores more points in each round is the winner of that rounds; the bout ends when one wrestler has won two rounds (and thus the match).\n\n==Schedule==\n<small>All times are [[British

{"title_page": "Symbolic regression", "text_new": "{{Use American English|date = January 2019}}\n{{Short description|Type of regression analysis}}\n'''Symbolic regression''' is a type of [[regression analysis]] that searches the space of mathematical expressions to find the model that best fits a given dataset, both in terms of accuracy and simplicity. No particular model is provided as a starting point to the algorithm. Instead, initial expressions are formed by randomly combining mathematical building blocks such as [[Operation (mathematics)|mathematical operators]], [[analytic function]]s, [[Constant (mathematics)|constants]], and [[state variable]]s. Usually, a subset of these primitives will be specified by the person operating it, but that's not a requirement of the technique. The symbolic regression problem for mathematical functions has been tackled with a variety of methods, including recombining equations using [[genetic programming]]<ref name=\"schmidt2009distilling\"/> and physics inspired AI.<ref name=\"aifeynman\"/>\n\nBy not requiring a specific model to be specified, symbolic regression isn't affected by human bias, or unknown gaps in [[domain knowledge]]. It attempts to uncover the intrinsic relationships of the dataset, by letting the patterns in the data itself reveal the appropriate models, rather than imposing a model structure that is deemed mathematically tractable from a human perspective. The [[fitness function]] that drives the evolution of the models takes into account not only [[Residual (numerical analysis)|error metrics]] (to ensure the models accurately predict the data), but also special complexity measures,<ref name=\"complexity\"/> thus ensuring that the resulting models reveal the data's underlying structure in a way that's understandable from a human perspective. This facilitates reasoning and favors the odds of getting insights about the data-generating system.\n\n== Difference from classical regression ==\n\nWhile conventional regression techniques seek to optimize the parameters for a pre-specified model structure, symbolic regression avoids imposing prior assumptions, and instead infers the model from the data. In other words, it attempts to discover both model structures and model parameters.\n\nThis approach has the disadvantage of having a much larger space to search, because not only the search space in symbolic regression is infinite, but there are an infinite number of models which will perfectly fit a finite data set (provided that the model complexity isn't artificially limited). This means that it will possibly take a symbolic regression algorithm longer to find an appropriate model and parametrization, than traditional regression techniques. This can be attenuated by limiting the set of building blocks provided to the algorithm, based on existing knowledge of the system that produced the data; but in the end, using symbolic regression is a decision that has to be balanced with how much is known about the underlying system.\n\nNevertheless, this characteristic of symbolic regression also has advantages: because the [[evolutionary algorithm]] requires diversity in order to effectively explore the search space, the end result is likely to be a selection of high-scoring models (and their corresponding set of parameters). Examining this collection could provide better insight into the underlying process, and allows the user to identify an approximation that better fits their needs in terms of accuracy and simplicity.\n\n== See also ==\n* [[Eureqa]], a symbolic regression engine\n* [[HeuristicLab]], a software environment for heuristic and evolutionary algorithms, including symbolic regression\n* [[Closed-form expression#Conversion from numerical forms|Closed-form expression \u00a7 Conversion from numerical forms]]\n* [[Genetic programming]]<ref name=\"aifeynman\"/>\n* [[Kolmogorov complexity]]\n* [[Mathematical optimization]]\n* [[Regression analysis]]\n* [[Reverse mathematics]]\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist|refs=\n<ref name=\"schmidt2009distilling\">{{cite journal\n  | title      = Distilling free-form natural laws from experimental data\n  | author1    = Michael Schmidt\n  | author2    = Hod Lipson\n  | journal    = Science\n  | volume     = 324\n  | number     = 5923\n  | pages      = 81-85\n  | year       = 2009\n  | publisher  = American Association for the Advancement of Science\n  | url        = https://science.sciencemag.org/content/324/5923/81\n  | doi=10.1126/science.1165893\n  | citeseerx   = 10.1.1.308.2245\n  }}</ref>\n<ref name=\"aifeynman\">{{cite journal\n  | title     = AI Feynman: A physics-inspired method for symbolic regression\n  | author1   = Silviu-Marian Udrescu\n  | author2   = Max Tegmark\n  | journal   = Science_Advances\n  | volume    = 6\n  | number    = 16\n  | year      = 2020\n  | publisher = American Association for the Advancement of Science\n  | url       = https://advances.sciencemag.org/content/6/16/eaay2631\n  | doi       = 10.1126/sciadv.aay2631 \n  }}</ref>\n<ref name=\"complexity\">{{cite journal\n  | title     = Order of nonlinearity as a complexity measure for models generated by symbolic regression via pareto genetic programming\n  | author1   = Ekaterina J.

He founded the [[Mission San Xavier del Bac]] in 1700 about {{convert|7|mi|0|abbr=on}} upstream from the site of the settlement of Tucson. A separate Convento settlement was founded downstream along the Santa Cruz River, near the base of what is now known as [[Sentinel Peak (Arizona)|\"A\" mountain]]. [[Hugo Ocon\u00f3r|Hugo O'Conor]], the founding father of the city of Tucson, Arizona, authorized the construction of a military fort in that location, ''[[Presidio San Augustin del Tucson|Presidio San Agust\u00edn del Tucs\u00f3n]],'' on August 20, 1775 (the present downtown [[Pima County Courthouse]] was built near this site). During the Spanish period of the presidio, attacks such as the [[Second Battle of Tucson]] were repeatedly mounted by the [[Apache]]. Eventually the town came to be called ''Tucs\u00f3n,'' a Spanish version of the O'odham word for the area. It was included in the state of [[Sonora, Mexico|Sonora]] after [[Mexico]] gained independence from the [[Kingdom of Spain]] and its [[Spanish Empire]] in 1821.{{Citation needed|date=November 2018}}\n\nDuring the [[Mexican\u2013American War]] in 1846\u20131848, Tucs\u00f3n was [[capture of Tucson (1846)|captured]] by [[Philip St. George Cooke]] with the [[Mormon Battalion]], but it soon returned to Mexican control as Cooke proceeded to the west, establishing [[Cooke's Wagon Road]] to California. Tucs\u00f3n was not included in the [[Mexican Cession]] to the United States following the war. Cooke's road through Tucs\u00f3n became one of the important routes into California during the [[California Gold Rush]] of 1849.{{Citation needed|date=November 2018}}\n\nThe US acquired Arizona, south of the [[Gila River]], via treaty from Mexico in the [[Gadsden Purchase]] on June 8, 1854. Under this treaty and purchase, Tucs\u00f3n became a part of the United States of America. The American military did not formally take over control until March 1856. In time, the name of the town became standardized in English in its current form, where the stress is on the first syllable, the \"u\" is long, and the \"c\" is silent. \n\nIn 1857, Tucson was established as a stage station on the [[San Antonio-San Diego Mail Line]]. In 1858 it became 3rd division headquarters of the [[Butterfield Overland Mail]] and operated until the line was shut down in March 1861. The [[San Antonio-San Diego Mail Line|Overland Mail Corporation]] attempted to continue running; however, following the [[Bascom Affair]], devastating Apache attacks on the stations and coaches ended operations in August 1861.{{citation needed|date=November 2011}}\n\nFrom August 1861 to mid-1862, Tucson served as the western capital of the [[Confederate States of America|Confederate]] [[Arizona Territory (CSA)|Arizona Territory]], the eastern capital being [[Mesilla, New Mexico]]. In 1862, the [[California Column]] drove the Confederate forces out of Arizona. Tucson and all of what is now Arizona were included within the US [[New Mexico Territory]] until 1863, when they became part of the new [[Arizona Territory]].

The 6-member city council holds exclusive legislative authority, and shares executive authority with the mayor, who is elected by the voters independently of the council. An appointed city manager is responsible for the day-to-day operations of the city. Tucson is the only city in Arizona that holds officially partisan elections for city offices, with candidates being nominated through party primaries.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://ballot-access.org/2018/01/05/arizona-legislature/|title=Arizona Legislature {{!}} Ballot Access News|website=ballot-access.org|language=en-US|access-date=2018-01-05|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180105212401/http://ballot-access.org/2018/01/05/arizona-legislature/|archive-date=January 5, 2018|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nBoth the council members and the mayor serve four-year terms; none face term limits. Council members are nominated by their wards via a ward-level primary held in August. The top vote-earners from each party then compete at-large for their ward's seat on the November ballot. In other words, on [[Election Day (politics)|election day]] the whole city votes on all the council races up for that year. Council elections are severed: Wards 1, 2, and 4 (as well as the mayor) are up for election in the same year (most recently 2015), while Wards 3, 5, and 6 share another year (most recently 2017).\n\nTucson is known for being a trailblazer in voluntary partial [[campaign finance|publicly financed campaigns]]. Since 1985, both mayoral and council candidates have been eligible to receive matching public funds from the city. To become eligible, council candidates must receive 200 donations of $10 or more (300 for a mayoral candidate). Candidates must then agree to spending limits equal to 33\u00a2 for every registered Tucson voter, or $79,222 in 2005 (the corresponding figures for mayor are 64\u00a2 per registered voter, or $142,271 in 2003). In return, candidates receive matching funds from the city at a 1:1 ratio of public money to private donations. The only other limitation is that candidates may not exceed 75% of the limit by the date of the primary. Many cities, such as San Francisco and New York City, have copied this system, albeit with more complex spending and matching formulas.\n\nMayor [[Regina Romero]] (D) was sworn into office on December 2, 2019, succeeding [[Jonathan Rothschild]] (D) who was sworn into office on December 5, 2011, succeeding [[Robert E.

During the Spanish period of the presidio, attacks such as the [[Second Battle of Tucson]] were repeatedly mounted by the [[Apache]]. Eventually the town came to be called ''Tucs\u00f3n,'' a Spanish version of the O'odham word for the area.

Tucson is the only city in Arizona that holds officially partisan elections for city offices, with candidates being nominated through party primaries.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://ballot-access.org/2018/01/05/arizona-legislature/|title=Arizona Legislature {{!}} Ballot Access News|website=ballot-access.org|language=en-US|access-date=2018-01-05|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180105212401/http://ballot-access.org/2018/01/05/arizona-legislature/|archive-date=January 5, 2018|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nBoth the council members and the mayor serve four-year terms; none face term limits. Council members are nominated by their wards via a ward-level primary held in August. The top vote-earners from each party then compete at-large for their ward's seat on the November ballot. In other words, on [[Election Day (politics)|election day]] the whole city votes on all the council races up for that year. Council elections are severed: Wards 1, 2, and 4 (as well as the mayor) are up for election in the same year (most recently 2015), while Wards 3, 5, and 6 share another year (most recently 2017).\n\nTucson is known for being a trailblazer in voluntary partial [[campaign finance|publicly financed campaigns]]. Since 1985, both mayoral and council candidates have been eligible to receive matching public funds from the city. To become eligible, council candidates must receive 200 donations of $10 or more (300 for a mayoral candidate). Candidates must then agree to spending limits equal to 33\u00a2 for every registered Tucson voter, or $79,222 in 2005 (the corresponding figures for mayor are 64\u00a2 per registered voter, or $142,271 in 2003). In return, candidates receive matching funds from the city at a 1:1 ratio of public money to private donations. The only other limitation is that candidates may not exceed 75% of the limit by the date of the primary. Many cities, such as San Francisco and New York City, have copied this system, albeit with more complex spending and matching formulas.\n\nMayor [[Regina Romero]] (D) was sworn into office on December 2, 2019, succeeding [[Jonathan Rothschild]] (D) who was sworn into office on December 5, 2011, succeeding [[Robert E.
