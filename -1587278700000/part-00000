The following summer, the Currie Cup was established as a domestic competition. The trophy was donated by and named after [[Donald Currie|Sir Donald Currie]]. An earlier competition, the [[Champion Bat Tournament]], was established in 1876 and played on five occasions, generally between towns from the major settlements in the Cape. Only the final edition of the Champion Bat was accorded first-class status, contested by Eastern Province, Griqualand West, and Western Province during the 1890\u201391 season.\n\nThe [[1889\u201390 Currie Cup|inaugural competition, in 1889\u201390]], consisted of a single match between [[Griqualand West cricket team|Kimberley]] and [[Gauteng cricket team|Transvaal]]. In this match, Bernard Tancred (106), for Kimberley and Monty Bowden (126*), for Transvaal, both in the second innings, scored the first centuries in Currie Cup cricket. In the first innings of the same match, George Glover took 6/50 for Kimberley. The following season saw a rematch between Kimberley and Transvaal; Charlie Finlason scored 154* for Kimberley, and John Piton took 13/204 for Transvaal in the match. Each team won one of these initial two encounters.\n\nBetween then and the First World War, the competition expanded. Kimberley (who became known as [[Griqualand West cricket team|Griqualand West]] for the 1892-93 season) and Transvaal were joined by [[Western Province cricket team|Western Province]] (1892\u201393), [[KwaZulu-Natal cricket team|Natal]], [[Eastern Province cricket team|Eastern Province]] (both 1893-94), [[Border cricket team|Border]] (1897\u201398) and [[Free State cricket team|Orange Free State]] (1903\u201304) &mdash; although not all of these teams competed in every season after they were established. [[Rhodesia cricket team|Rhodesia]] and [[South Western Districts cricket team|South Western Districts]] also competed on a once-off basis in the 1904-05 season.\n\nThe Currie Cup was not contested every year, and a total of fourteen seasons were contested between inception and the [[First World War]]. Aside from a recess during the [[Boer War]], typically seasons were not held when the English team was touring. The tournament took on several different formats, including a knock-out tournament, and a round robin followed by a challenge final against the previous year's winner; but in 1906-07, a round robin league format was established, which would be unchanged until 1982-83.\n\n===Between the wars===\nFirst class cricket recommenced after the war in the 1920-21 season. The series continued to be held roughly two out of every three years, being cancelled during seasons which coincided with test tours. After the 1925-26, all seven provincial teams featured in every season. They were joined temporarily by [[Rhodesia cricket team|Rhodesia]] (who contested the consecutive 1929-30 and 1931-32 season), and permanently by [[Northerns cricket team|North Eastern Transvaal]] in 1937-38, which was the final season before [[World War II]]. In all, eleven seasons were played between the wars.\n\n===World War II to Isolation===\nAfter an eight-year hiatus, the Currie Cup restarted in 1946-47 with all eight provincial teams and Rhodesia, who would now feature permanently.\n\nIn 1951-52, the competition adopted a two-tiered structure, which was retained in some format until 1999-2000 (except for a once-off recombination into a single division in 1960-61). From its inception until South Africa's international isolation in 1971, a promotion/relegation structure linked the two tiers, with the winner of the lower division generally replacing the last placed team from the top division &mdash; although this was not adhered to every season. The top division generally consisted of four or five teams.\n\nDuring this time, the stronger provinces began to field a 'B' team in the lower division. [[Gauteng cricket team|Transvaal B]] was the first to appear (1959\u201360), followed by [[KwaZulu-Natal cricket team|Natal B]] (1965\u201366). These B-teams were not promoted to the top division when they won the lower competition.\n\nSince the 1965-66 season, the Currie Cup has been contested every year, and was no longer suspended during international tours.\n\n===Isolation - the 1970s===\nDomestic cricket in South Africa reached its peak during the years of isolation in the 1970s and 1980s. With standards exceptionally high, spectators came in their thousands to watch Currie Cup cricket.\n\nThe two-division format was retained, but promotion/relegation was abandoned, and from 1971\u201372, the top division remained constant with five teams: Transvaal, Natal, Eastern Province, Western Province and Rhodesia. The second division expanded with more B-teams: [[Western Province cricket team|Western Province B]] joining in 1975-76, and [[Eastern Province cricket team|Eastern Province B]] and [[Rhodesia cricket team|Rhodesia B]] joining in 1977-78.\n\nDuring the 1970s, the second division became a separate competition from the Currie Cup, known initially as the Castle Bowl (and later under different commercial names, such as UCB Bowl). In 1971-72, North Eastern Transvaal became known as [[Northern Transvaal]].\n\n===Isolation and restoration - the 1980s and 1990s===\nThrough the 1980s and 1990s, the weaker provincial teams began to gradually migrate back from the Bowl competition to the Currie Cup. At the same time, those provinces' B-teams began to contest the Bowl, which gradually turned the Bowl entirely into a Currie Cup seconds competition. By 1996-97, the Bowl had split into a two-tier competition (with only the top division given first-class status); by 1999-2000, all stand-alone provincial teams had returned to the Currie Cup, and the Bowl was stripped of first-class status entirely.\n\nNorthern Transvaal was the first team to return to the Currie Cup, in 1979-80; that same year was the final year for Rhodesia, which did not participate following the country's independence as [[Zimbabwe]] from the [[United Kingdom]]. Orange Free State returned to the Currie Cup in 1985-86. Border returned permanently in 1991-92 (following an unsuccessful two-season return in 1985-86 and 1986\u201387). Griqualand West returned in 1996-97. In addition, three new provincial teams entered during this time: [[Boland cricket team|Boland]], who entered the Bowl in 1980-81, and entered the Cup in 1993-94; and [[Easterns cricket team|Eastern Transvaal]] and [[North West cricket team|Western Transvaal]], who entered the Bowl in 1991-92, and were the last two teams promoted to the top level in 1999-2000 before the Bowl concluded.\n\nDuring the same time, the Bowl competition was joined by [[Northerns cricket team|Northern Transvaal B]] (1982\u201383), [[Free State cricket team|Orange Free State B]] (1989\u201390), [[Border cricket team|Border B]] and [[Boland cricket team|Boland B]] (1993\u201394) and [[Griqualand West cricket team|Griqualand West B]] (1997\u201398), as well as a [[Zimbabwe national cricket team|Zimbabwean Board XI]] (1993\u201394) and [[Namibia cricket team]] (1996\u201397).\n\nDuring the 1990s, as South Africa underwent political changes, several teams changed their names to adapt: Orange Free State became [[Free State cricket team|Free State]] (1995\u201396); Eastern Transvaal became [[Easterns cricket team|Easterns]] (1995\u201396); Western Transvaal became [[North West cricket team|North West]] (1996\u201397); Transvaal became [[Gauteng cricket team|Gauteng]] (1997\u201398); Northern Transvaal became [[Northerns cricket team|Northerns]] (1997\u201398); and Natal became [[KwaZulu-Natal cricket team|KwaZulu-Natal]] (1998\u201399). The competition itself also changed its name for commercial reasons, becoming the Castle Cup in 1990-91, and then the SuperSport Series in 1996-97.\n\nDuring this era, the format of the competition changed several times. In 1982-83, a final was played between the top two teams; this was expanded to a four-team knock-out in 1983-84, and contracted to a three-team knock-out in 1985-86. In 1987-88, the league was split into two pools with a single final between the pool winners. In 1990-91, the league returned to a single pool with no final. The final returned in 1998-99. Then, with eleven teams from 1999\u20132000, the league adopted a format similar to the [[1999 Cricket World Cup]], with a super eight or super six round before a single final.\n\nThe most notable feature of this era was the end of the dominance of Transvaal, Natal and Western Province. Prior to the 1988-89 season, the three teams had amongst them won 59 of the 60 Currie Cups contested &mdash; the only exception being Kimberley's win in the second tournament in 1890-91, won based on the result of a single game against Transvaal. In 1988-89, Eastern Province finally broke the dominance when it beat Transvaal in the final. Orange Free State would win its first championship in the 1990s, and Easterns would also win a championship in the 2000s.\n\n===Current Era===\nIn 2004-05, the format of South African domestic cricket was changed entirely. The eleven provincial teams were rationalised into six new teams: Western Province and Boland merged to form the [[Cape Cobras]]; Griqualand West and Free State formed the [[Knights (cricket team)|Eagles]] (who later became the [[Knights (cricket team)|Knights]] in 2010-11); Eastern Province and Border became the [[Warriors cricket team|Warriors]]; North West and Gauteng became the [[Highveld Lions cricket team|Lions]]; Northerns and Easterns became the [[Titans cricket team|Titans]]; and KwaZulu-Natal became the [[Dolphins cricket team|Dolphins]]. These changes occurred across limited overs cricket as well as first class cricket.\n\nThe format of the new competition is a double-round robin. In its first two seasons, the top two contested a final to determine the winner, but both finals finished in draws and the titles were shared (in contrast to most domestic cricket leagues, including earlier Currie Cup formats, where in the case of a drawn final, the title is awarded to the team which finished with the better record). The final was abandoned in 2006-07, and the title is awarded solely on regular season record.\n\nThe eleven provincial Currie Cup teams, as well as South Western Districts, [[KwaZulu-Natal Inland cricket team|KwaZulu-Natal Inland]] and Namibia, continue to compete separately in the [[South African Airways Provincial Challenges|South African Airways Provincial Three-Day Challenge]], which remains a first-class competition, despite no longer being the top level of red-ball cricket in South Africa.\n\n==Winners==\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|- bgcolor=#efefef\n| '''Season''' ||

'''Sunfoil Series''' is the main domestic [[First-class cricket|first class]] [[cricket]] competition in [[South Africa]], first contested (as the ''Currie Cup'') in [[1889-90 South African cricket season|1889-90]]. From [[1990-91 South African cricket season|1990-91]] it became known as the ''Castle Cup'', from [[1996-97 South African cricket season|1996-97]] as the ''Supersport Series'' and from [[2012-13 South African cricket season|2012-13]] by The Sunfoil series. The [[Highveld Lions cricket team|Highveld Lions]] (formerly Transvaal) have won the title the most times (25, plus four shared titles).\n\n== Current teams ==\n{{col-begin}}\n{{col-break}}\n{|class=\"wikitable\"\n|-bgcolor=#bdb76b\n!Team!!Province\n|-\n|| [[Cape Cobras]] || [[Western Cape]]\n|-\n|| [[Dolphins cricket team|Dolphins]] || [[KwaZulu-Natal]]\n|-\n|| [[Knights (cricket team)|Knights]]* || [[Free State (South African province)|Free State]] & [[Northern Cape]] \n|-\n|| [[Highveld Lions cricket team|Lions]] || Central [[Gauteng]] & [[North West (South African province)|North West]]\n|-\n|| [[Titans cricket team|Titans]] || Northern and eastern [[Gauteng]]\n|-\n|| [[Warriors cricket team|Warriors]] || [[Eastern Cape]]\n|-\n|}\n{{col-end}}\nKnights were known as the Eagles prior to the 2010-11 season.\n\n== Current points System ==\nTeams are awarded points based on the result of the match as follows:\n* Outright victory: 16 points\n* Tie: 8 points\n* Draw: 6 points\n* Any other result: 0 points\n\nIn addition, teams earn bonus points based on their performance in the first 100 overs of each team's first innings:\n* Batting bonus points: 1 point for reaching 150 runs, then 0.02 points for each run thereafter\n* Bowling bonus points: 1 point for taking three wickets, then 1 point for each two wickets thereafter\n\nA points system of this basic structure was first introduced in 1971-72, and has been used in almost all seasons since; the exact points values used today were first introduced in the 2017-18 season.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://cricket.co.za/news/20810/CSA-announces-new-points-system-for-first-class-cricket|title=CSA announces new points system for first-class cricket|website=cricket.co.za|access-date=2018-03-15}}</ref>\n\n==History==\n===Early Years===\nCricket in South Africa was established by the British, and the first tour by a side from England took place in 1888-89. The following summer, the Currie Cup was established as a domestic competition. The trophy was donated by and named after [[Donald Currie|Sir Donald Currie]]. An earlier competition, the [[Champion Bat Tournament]], was established in 1876 and played on five occasions, generally between towns from the major settlements in the Cape. Only the final edition of the Champion Bat was accorded first-class status, contested by Eastern Province, Griqualand West, and Western Province during the 1890\u201391 season.\n\nThe [[1889\u201390 Currie Cup|inaugural competition, in 1889\u201390]], consisted of a single match between [[Griqualand West cricket team|Kimberley]] and [[Gauteng cricket team|Transvaal]]. In this match, Bernard Tancred (106), for Kimberley and Monty Bowden (126*), for Transvaal, both in the second innings, scored the first centuries in Currie Cup cricket. In the first innings of the same match, George Glover took 6/50 for Kimberley. The following season saw a rematch between Kimberley and Transvaal; Charlie Finlason scored 154* for Kimberley, and John Piton took 13/204 for Transvaal in the match. Each team won one of these initial two encounters.\n\nBetween then and the First World War, the competition expanded. Kimberley (who became known as [[Griqualand West cricket team|Griqualand West]] for the 1892-93 season) and Transvaal were joined by [[Western Province cricket team|Western Province]] (1892\u201393), [[KwaZulu-Natal cricket team|Natal]], [[Eastern Province cricket team|Eastern Province]] (both 1893-94), [[Border cricket team|Border]] (1897\u201398) and [[Free State cricket team|Orange Free State]] (1903\u201304) &mdash; although not all of these teams competed in every season after they were established. [[Rhodesia cricket team|Rhodesia]] and [[South Western Districts cricket team|South Western Districts]] also competed on a once-off basis in the 1904-05 season.\n\nThe Currie Cup was not contested every year, and a total of fourteen seasons were contested between inception and the [[First World War]]. Aside from a recess during the [[Boer War]], typically seasons were not held when the English team was touring. The tournament took on several different formats, including a knock-out tournament, and a round robin followed by a challenge final against the previous year's winner; but in 1906-07, a round robin league format was established, which would be unchanged until 1982-83.\n\n===Between the wars===\nFirst class cricket recommenced after the war in the 1920-21 season. The series continued to be held roughly two out of every three years, being cancelled during seasons which coincided with test tours. After the 1925-26, all seven provincial teams featured in every season. They were joined temporarily by [[Rhodesia cricket team|Rhodesia]] (who contested the consecutive 1929-30 and 1931-32 season), and permanently by [[Northerns cricket team|North Eastern Transvaal]] in 1937-38, which was the final season before [[World War II]]. In all, eleven seasons were played between the wars.\n\n===World War II to Isolation===\nAfter an eight-year hiatus, the Currie Cup restarted in 1946-47 with all eight provincial teams and Rhodesia, who would now feature permanently.\n\nIn 1951-52, the competition adopted a two-tiered structure, which was retained in some format until 1999-2000 (except for a once-off recombination into a single division in 1960-61). From its inception until South Africa's international isolation in 1971, a promotion/relegation structure linked the two tiers, with the winner of the lower division generally replacing the last placed team from the top division &mdash; although this was not adhered to every season. The top division generally consisted of four or five teams.\n\nDuring this time, the stronger provinces began to field a 'B' team in the lower division. [[Gauteng cricket team|Transvaal B]] was the first to appear (1959\u201360), followed by [[KwaZulu-Natal cricket team|Natal B]] (1965\u201366). These B-teams were not promoted to the top division when they won the lower competition.\n\nSince the 1965-66 season, the Currie Cup has been contested every year, and was no longer suspended during international tours.\n\n===Isolation - the 1970s===\nDomestic cricket in South Africa reached its peak during the years of isolation in the 1970s and 1980s. With standards exceptionally high, spectators came in their thousands to watch Currie Cup cricket.\n\nThe two-division format was retained, but promotion/relegation was abandoned, and from 1971\u201372, the top division remained constant with five teams: Transvaal, Natal, Eastern Province, Western Province and Rhodesia. The second division expanded with more B-teams: [[Western Province cricket team|Western Province B]] joining in 1975-76, and [[Eastern Province cricket team|Eastern Province B]] and [[Rhodesia cricket team|Rhodesia B]] joining in 1977-78.\n\nDuring the 1970s, the second division became a separate competition from the Currie Cup, known initially as the Castle Bowl (and later under different commercial names, such as UCB Bowl). In 1971-72, North Eastern Transvaal became known as [[Northern Transvaal]].\n\n===Isolation and restoration - the 1980s and 1990s===\nThrough the 1980s and 1990s, the weaker provincial teams began to gradually migrate back from the Bowl competition to the Currie Cup. At the same time, those provinces' B-teams began to contest the Bowl, which gradually turned the Bowl entirely into a Currie Cup seconds competition. By 1996-97, the Bowl had split into a two-tier competition (with only the top division given first-class status); by 1999-2000, all stand-alone provincial teams had returned to the Currie Cup, and the Bowl was stripped of first-class status entirely.\n\nNorthern Transvaal was the first team to return to the Currie Cup, in 1979-80; that same year was the final year for Rhodesia, which did not participate following the country's independence as [[Zimbabwe]] from the [[United Kingdom]]. Orange Free State returned to the Currie Cup in 1985-86. Border returned permanently in 1991-92 (following an unsuccessful two-season return in 1985-86 and 1986\u201387). Griqualand West returned in 1996-97. In addition, three new provincial teams entered during this time: [[Boland cricket team|Boland]], who entered the Bowl in 1980-81, and entered the Cup in 1993-94; and [[Easterns cricket team|Eastern Transvaal]] and [[North West cricket team|Western Transvaal]], who entered the Bowl in 1991-92, and were the last two teams promoted to the top level in 1999-2000 before the Bowl concluded.\n\nDuring the same time, the Bowl competition was joined by [[Northerns cricket team|Northern Transvaal B]] (1982\u201383), [[Free State cricket team|Orange Free State B]] (1989\u201390), [[Border cricket team|Border B]] and [[Boland cricket team|Boland B]] (1993\u201394) and [[Griqualand West cricket team|Griqualand West B]] (1997\u201398), as well as a [[Zimbabwe national cricket team|Zimbabwean Board XI]] (1993\u201394) and [[Namibia cricket team]] (1996\u201397).\n\nDuring the 1990s, as South Africa underwent political changes, several teams changed their names to adapt: Orange Free State became [[Free State cricket team|Free State]] (1995\u201396); Eastern Transvaal became [[Easterns cricket team|Easterns]] (1995\u201396); Western Transvaal became [[North West cricket team|North West]] (1996\u201397); Transvaal became [[Gauteng cricket team|Gauteng]] (1997\u201398); Northern Transvaal became [[Northerns cricket team|Northerns]] (1997\u201398); and Natal became [[KwaZulu-Natal cricket team|KwaZulu-Natal]] (1998\u201399). The competition itself also changed its name for commercial reasons, becoming the Castle Cup in 1990-91, and then the SuperSport Series in 1996-97.\n\nDuring this era, the format of the competition changed several times. In 1982-83, a final was played between the top two teams; this was expanded to a four-team knock-out in 1983-84, and contracted to a three-team knock-out in 1985-86. In 1987-88, the league was split into two pools with a single final between the pool winners. In 1990-91, the league returned to a single pool with no final. The final returned in 1998-99. Then, with eleven teams from 1999\u20132000, the league adopted a format similar to the [[1999 Cricket World Cup]], with a super eight or super six round before a single final.\n\nThe most notable feature of this era was the end of the dominance of Transvaal, Natal and Western Province. Prior to the 1988-89 season, the three teams had amongst them won 59 of the 60 Currie Cups contested &mdash; the only exception being Kimberley's win in the second tournament in 1890-91, won based on the result of a single game against Transvaal. In 1988-89, Eastern Province finally broke the dominance when it beat Transvaal in the final. Orange Free State would win its first championship in the 1990s, and Easterns would also win a championship in the 2000s.\n\n===Current Era===\nIn 2004-05, the format of South African domestic cricket was changed entirely. The eleven provincial teams were rationalised into six new teams: Western Province and Boland merged to form the [[Cape Cobras]]; Griqualand West and Free State formed the [[Knights (cricket team)|Eagles]] (who later became the [[Knights (cricket team)|Knights]] in 2010-11); Eastern Province and Border became the [[Warriors cricket team|Warriors]]; North West and Gauteng became the [[Highveld Lions cricket team|Lions]]; Northerns and Easterns became the [[Titans cricket team|Titans]]; and KwaZulu-Natal became the [[Dolphins cricket team|Dolphins]]. These changes occurred across limited overs cricket as well as first class cricket.\n\nThe format of the new competition is a double-round robin. In its first two seasons, the top two contested a final to determine the winner, but both finals finished in draws and the titles were shared (in contrast to most domestic cricket leagues, including earlier Currie Cup formats, where in the case of a drawn final, the title is awarded to the team which finished with the better record). The final was abandoned in 2006-07, and the title is awarded solely on regular season record.\n\nThe eleven provincial Currie Cup teams, as well as South Western Districts, [[KwaZulu-Natal Inland cricket team|KwaZulu-Natal Inland]] and Namibia, continue to compete separately in the [[South African Airways Provincial Challenges|South African Airways Provincial Three-Day Challenge]], which remains a first-class competition, despite no longer being the top level of red-ball cricket in South Africa.\n\n==Winners==\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|- bgcolor=#efefef\n| '''Season''' ||

He is best known for his hit singles \"Smoke and Fly\", \"Reggae Souljahs\" and \"Smuggling Weed\". He was a full-time employee for the Ministry of Education Youth and Culture in [[Jamaica]] when he recorded all three songs. His stage name was derived from the [[Jamaican creole]] for \"teacher\" and a shortening of his childhood [[nickname]] \"Demus\".<ref name=\"Jamaica-Gleaner\">{{cite news | url=http://jamaica-gleaner.com/article/entertainment/20161112/positive-tracks-jameik-king-teacha-dee | title=Positive tracks Jameik king, Teacha Dee | work=The Jamaica Gleaner|author=Carl Gilchrist}}</ref><ref name=\"The Jamaica Star\">{{cite news | url=http://jamaica-star.com/article/entertainment/20161021/teacha-dee-does-it-rastafari-way | title=Teacha Dee does it Rastafari Way | work=Jamaica Star |author=Jamaica Star}}</ref><ref name=\"The Jamaica Observer\">{{cite news | url=http://www.jamaicaobserver.com/entertainment/Teacha-Dee-travels-Rastafari-way_78907 | title=Teacha Dee travels Rastafari way | work=The Jamaica Observer |author=Jamaica Observer}}</ref>\n\n==Early life and education==\nWarren was born on 21 September 1980 in [[Westmoreland, Jamaica]]. He grew up in a little district called Bath where he attended the Unity Primary School. Being successful in his Common Entrance Exams, he was rewarded a place at the prestigious Manning's School from which he graduated in 1997 before relocating to [[Montego Bay]] to live with his mother. Warren then attended the Sam Sharpe Teachers College secondary programme to pursue his teaching career.\n\n==Teaching career==\nIn September 2000, Warren was employed by the Ministry of Education Youth and Culture to teach Mathematics, Integrated Science and Information Communication Technology. He worked at the Glendevon Primary and Junior High School located in Montego Bay, up until his resignation in May 2012, to pursue entertainment.<ref name=\"Jamaica-Gleaner\"/>\n\n== Music career ==\nIn May 2005, Teacha Dee began his professional recordings with The Mighty Powpow Productions a major German production label. He recorded \"Life Goes on\" which is a reggae song sung in the melody of [[The Beatles]] hit \"[Ob La Di]\". This song was released in 2006 as part of a compilation CD titled \"First Sight Riddim\". However, \"life goes on\" was not published as \"Teacha Dee\" but as \"Damian Warren\". This resulted in the song been listed on many reggae database sites as belonging to a separate artiste.<ref name=\"Jamaica-Gleaner\"/><ref name=\"The Jamaica Star\"/><ref name=\"The Jamaica Observer\"/>\n\nIn late 2006, he recorded a song titled \"Them A Play\" for Dasvibes Productions. This was released on a riddim compilation called \"Gloria Riddim\". The single was the first song on which he was officially recognized as \"Teacha Dee\". All songs recorded after this date were released as Teacha Dee and not his given name.[[File:Teacha Dee Ras Tafarian Picture.jpg|thumb|left|Teacha Dee Ras Tafarian Picture]]\n\nIn 2007, he recorded \"Smuggling Weed\" for Powpow Movements which became his first popular song within the European scene. However, his most successful song at that time was \"Smoke and Fly\". This was recorded as a sound system dub on the \"Kingston Town\" instrumental made popular by an Italian reggae superstar [[Alborosie|Alberto Dascola aka Alborosie]]. This song\" quickly became a sound system's favorite and a huge hit within the reggae clubs.\n\nEarly 2008, Teacha Dee recorded \"Blaming Game\" for Master J Productions. This was a record label based in Montego Bay, Jamaica. \"Blaming Game\" was the first single that was in circulation on the radio stations in Jamaica. Prior to this, his music was gaining a lot of attention outside of Jamaica without the knowledge of many Jamaicans and the Ministry of Education. Teacha Dee also recorded \"Reggae Souljahs\" later that same year that quickly became a popular reggae anthem in Germany. This song was produced by Rootdown Records and released on a various artiste compilation called \"Ilove Riddim\". In August 2008, Teacha Dee started his own label called \"Tenfloor Records\".\n\nAfter some years of study, Teacha Dee accepted the Ras Tafari way of life in June 2010. This brought about a remarkable change in the messages in his music as well as his overall image. In August 2010, he began to focus on his own production company and produced his first collaboration titled \"what i pray\". This song features 'Determine', an artiste famous for a massive hit with [[Beenie Man]]. Teacha Dee released two various artiste compilations quickly after on his label. These were \"Hot Box Riddim\" and \"Thirteen Riddim\" both released in late 2010 and early 2011 respectively.[[File:Teacha Dee April 2013.jpg|thumb|Teacha Dee Rastafarian Picture as of April 2013]]\n\nIn the summer of 2011, Teacha Dee embarked on his first European tour during his vacation leave from teaching.

He is best known for his hit singles \"Smoke and Fly\", \"Reggae Souljahs\" and \"Smuggling Weed\". He was a full-time employee for the Ministry of Education Youth and Culture in [[Jamaica]] when he recorded all three songs. His stage name was derived from the [[Jamaican creole]] for \"teacher\" and a shortening of his childhood [[nickname]] \"Demus\".<ref name=\"Jamaica-Gleaner\">{{cite news | url=http://jamaica-gleaner.com/article/entertainment/20161112/positive-tracks-jameik-king-teacha-dee | title=Positive tracks Jameik king, Teacha Dee | work=The Jamaica Gleaner|author=Carl Gilchrist}}</ref><ref name=\"The Jamaica Star\">{{cite news | url=http://jamaica-star.com/article/entertainment/20161021/teacha-dee-does-it-rastafari-way | title=Teacha Dee does it Rastafari Way | work=Jamaica Star |author=Jamaica Star}}</ref><ref name=\"The Jamaica Observer\">{{cite news | url=http://www.jamaicaobserver.com/entertainment/Teacha-Dee-travels-Rastafari-way_78907 | title=Teacha Dee travels Rastafari way | work=The Jamaica Observer |author=Jamaica Observer}}</ref>\n\n==Early life and education==\nWarren was born on 21 September 1980 in [[Westmoreland, Jamaica]]. He grew up in a little district called Bath where he attended the Unity Primary School. Being successful in his Common Entrance Exams, he was rewarded a place at the prestigious Manning's School from which he graduated in 1997 before relocating to [[Montego Bay]] to live with his mother. Warren then attended the Sam Sharpe Teachers College secondary programme to pursue his teaching career.\n\n==Teaching career==\nIn September 2000, Warren was employed by the Ministry of Education Youth and Culture to teach Mathematics, Integrated Science and Information Communication Technology. He worked at the Glendevon Primary and Junior High School located in Montego Bay, up until his resignation in May 2012, to pursue entertainment.<ref name=\"Jamaica-Gleaner\"/>\n\n== Music career ==\nIn May 2005, Teacha Dee began his professional recordings with The Mighty Powpow Productions a major German production label. He recorded \"Life Goes on\" which is a reggae song sung in the melody of [[The Beatles]] hit \"[Ob La Di]\". This song was released in 2006 as part of a compilation CD titled \"First Sight Riddim\". However, \"life goes on\" was not published as \"Teacha Dee\" but as \"Damian Warren\". This resulted in the song been listed on many reggae database sites as belonging to a separate artiste.<ref name=\"Jamaica-Gleaner\"/><ref name=\"The Jamaica Star\"/><ref name=\"The Jamaica Observer\"/>\n\nIn late 2006, he recorded a song titled \"Them A Play\" for Dasvibes Productions. This was released on a riddim compilation called \"Gloria Riddim\". The single was the first song on which he was officially recognized as \"Teacha Dee\". All songs recorded after this date were released as Teacha Dee and not his given name.[[File:Teacha Dee Ras Tafarian Picture.jpg|thumb|left|Teacha Dee Ras Tafarian Picture]]\n\nIn 2007, he recorded \"Smuggling Weed\" for Powpow Movements which became his first popular song within the European scene. However, his most successful song at that time was \"Smoke and Fly\". This was recorded as a sound system dub on the \"Kingston Town\" instrumental made popular by an Italian reggae superstar [[Alborosie|Alberto Dascola aka Alborosie]]. This song\" quickly became a sound system's favorite and a huge hit within the reggae clubs.\n\nEarly 2008, Teacha Dee recorded \"Blaming Game\" for Master J Productions. This was a record label based in Montego Bay, Jamaica. \"Blaming Game\" was the first single that was in circulation on the radio stations in Jamaica. Prior to this, his music was gaining a lot of attention outside of Jamaica without the knowledge of many Jamaicans and the Ministry of Education. Teacha Dee also recorded \"Reggae Souljahs\" later that same year that quickly became a popular reggae anthem in Germany. This song was produced by Rootdown Records and released on a various artiste compilation called \"Ilove Riddim\". In August 2008, Teacha Dee started his own label called \"Tenfloor Records\".\n\nAfter some years of study, Teacha Dee accepted the Ras Tafari way of life in June 2010. This brought about a remarkable change in the messages in his music as well as his overall image. In August 2010, he began to focus on his own production company and produced his first collaboration titled \"what i pray\". This song features 'Determine', an artiste famous for a massive hit with [[Beenie Man]]. Teacha Dee released two various artiste compilations quickly after on his label. These were \"Hot Box Riddim\" and \"Thirteen Riddim\" both released in late 2010 and early 2011 respectively.[[File:Teacha Dee April 2013.jpg|thumb|Teacha Dee Rastafarian Picture as of April 2013]]\n\nIn the summer of 2011, Teacha Dee embarked on his first European tour during his vacation leave from teaching. This tour gave a strong boost to his career on the international scene. The people who loved his songs, could now put a face to his music. His first tour included appearances at Yaam and Insel Clubs in Berlin, Faust in Hannover, Magnapop in Krefeld, Petit Prince and L\u00fcxor in K\u00f6ln, Rude 7 in Mannheim, Kulturfabrik in Hildeshiem, Wagen Bau in Hamburg and U-club in Wupertal. The highlight of his tour was his performance at the prestigious Reggaejam Festival in Bersenbr\u00fcck, Germany.<ref name=\"Reggaejam - Bersenbr\u00fcck Festivalerinnerungen\">{{cite news | url=http://www.reggaestory.de/stories/reggae-jam-2011.html | title= Reggaejam \u2013 Bersenbr\u00fcck Festivalerinnerungen 2011 | work=reggaestory.de | author=Reggaestory}}</ref>\n\nDuring this trip Teacha Dee recorded for several producers. \"Symbiz Productions\" based in Germany, \"Catchy Grezzly\" based in Italy and \"Soul Force Music\" also based in Germany. In October 2011 immediately after his first tour, Teacha Dee released his debut album entitled \"Reggae Souljahs: Beating Babylon With Music\". This album was released on his own independent record label.\n\nIn April 2012, Teacha Dee returned to Europe for a mini tour. On this trip, he performed in Cantu Italy, Bern Switzerland and Oldenburg Germany. He also did repeated performances in Osnabruck and Mannheim. It was during this time he recorded a collaboration with 'Skarra Mucci' entitled \"Summer Time\" for \"Weedy G SoundForce\" a Swiss-based label. This was how his affiliation with Weedy G Soundforce for whom he recorded many singles began. In May 2012, Teacha Dee recorded \"Sound System\" for Reggaeville/Oneness Productions both based in Germany. He also worked with producers such as \"Catchy Greezly\" based in Italy, Jugglers Music and Deebuzz Music both based in Germany. A total of 12 singles were released that same year for various producers including his own record label.\n\nIn August 2013, Teacha Dee and Utan Green collaborated on a single entitled \"Reggae Show\" on the \" Reggae Jam Riddim\" which was released at the 19th staging of the Reggae Jam festival held in Bersenbruck, Germany. Teacha Dee was a headliner for this festival.<ref name=\"Reggaejam 2013 line up\">{{cite news | url=http://www.reggaeville.com/nc/festival-details/festival/reggae-jam-2013/ac/festivalLineup.html | title=Reggaejam 2013 line up | work=Reggaeville festival-details|author=Reggaeville}}</ref>\n\nOn 4 July 2014, \"Party Day\" recorded for Germany-based upcoming producers \"Dancehallrulerz\" made it to the number one spot on the official German reggae charts. This chart presented by Jugglerz radio and Riddim Magazine, was the official Reggae chart of Germany. \"Party Day\" held the number one spot on two separate occasions. It went down the charts for a short time before returning to number one spot a few days later. These charts numbered 30/2014 and 33/2014 were posted on 26 August and 22 September respectively.<ref>{{cite news | url=http://www.jugglerz.de/2014/08/reggae-charts-germany-302014/| title=German Reggae Chart 30/2014| work=Jugglerz Radioshow | date=26 August 2014| author=Lasse}}</ref><ref>{{cite news | url=http://www.jugglerz.de/2014/09/reggae-charts-germany-342014/| title=German Reggae Chart 34/2014| work=Jugglerz Radioshow | date=22 September 2014| author=Lasse}}</ref>\n\nIn July 2015, Teacha Dee released his first artiste mix-tape titled \"Rasta Ting\". It consisted of 26 tracks which were released within the European market and was presented by Europe's female sound sensation, Big Mama Sound. In that same month at the 21st staging of the Reggae Jam Festival in Bersenbruck, Teacha Dee's performance was reviewed as \"one of the most reviting\" by irieites.de. Their list of highlights also included [[David Rodigan]], [[Anthony B]], Alpheus, [[Ken Boothe]], Winston Francis and [[Bitty McLean]].<ref>{{cite news | url=http://www.irieites.de/wordpress/?p=9828/| title=Teacha Dee \u2013 Rasta Ting Mixtape| work=Irieites.de | date=24 August 2015| author=Karsten}}</ref><ref>{{cite news | url=http://www.irieites.de/wordpress/?p=9354/| title=Reggae Jam 2015 \u2013 Highlights| work=Irieites.de | date=27 July 2015| author=Karsten}}</ref><ref name=\"Reggaejam 2015 line up\">{{cite news | url=http://www.reggaeville.com/nc/festival-details/festival/reggae-jam-2015/ac/festivalLineup.html | title=Reggaejam 2015 full line up | work=Reggaeville festival-details|author=Reggaeville}}</ref>\n\nIn 2016, Teacha Dee released a total of ten singles.
