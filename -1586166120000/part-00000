(tennis)|Bob Lutz]], formed one of the most successful [[Doubles (tennis)|doubles]] teams of all time. Together, they won many major titles all over the world. In 1970, Smith won the first year end championship [[ATP World Tour Finals|Masters Grand Prix]] title. Smith's two major singles titles were the [[1971 US Open \u2013 Men's Singles|1971 US Open]] (over [[Jan Kode\u0161]] in the final), and [[1972 Wimbledon Championships \u2013 Men's Singles|1972 Wimbledon]] (over [[Ilie N\u0103stase]] in the final). In 1972, he was the year-ending world No. 1 singles player.<ref name=\"nyt1972\"/> In 1973, he won his second and last year end championship title at the Dallas [[WCT Finals]]. In addition, he won four [[Grand Prix Tennis Championship Series 1970\u20131989|Grand Prix Championship Series]] titles. His name is also used in a popular brand of tennis shoes. In his early years he improved his tennis game through lessons from [[Pancho Segura]], the Pasadena Tennis Patrons,<ref>{{cite book | title=Players: How sports became a business | publisher=Simon & Schuster | author=Futterman, Matthew | year=2016 | pages=95 | isbn=978-1-4767-1695-4}}</ref> and the sponsorship of the Southern California Tennis Association headed by [[Perry T. Jones]].\n\n==Career==\nSmith grew up in Pasadena, California and was coached mainly by [[Pancho Segura]]. He played collegiate tennis at the [[University of Southern California]] (USC), under Coach [[George Toley]], where he was a three-time [[All-American]] and won the [[1968 NCAA University Division Tennis Championships|1968 NCAA Singles Championship]] as well as the 1967 and 1968 doubles titles. At USC, Smith was a member of [[Beta Theta Pi]] fraternity's Gamma Tau chapter.\n\nAs a kid, he went to get a job as a ball boy for the Davis Cup, but was turned down because the organizers thought he was too clumsy.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.onlinecollege.org/2010/02/16/50-famously-successful-people-who-failed-at-first |title=50 Famously Successful People Who Failed At First |publisher=OnlineCollege.org |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111211080443/http://www.onlinecollege.org/2010/02/16/50-famously-successful-people-who-failed-at-first/ |archivedate=December 11, 2011 |df=mdy-all }}</ref>\n\nIn his 1979 autobiography, [[Jack Kramer (tennis)|Jack Kramer]], the long-time tennis promoter and great player himself, ranked Smith as one of the 21 best players of all time.<ref>Kramer considered the best player ever to have been either [[Don Budge]] (for consistent play) or [[Ellsworth Vines]] (at the height of his game). The next four best were, chronologically, [[Bill Tilden]], [[Fred Perry]], [[Bobby Riggs]], and [[Pancho Gonzales]].

They lived throughout northeastern South America, [[Trinidad and Tobago]], [[Barbados]], the [[Windward Islands]], [[Dominica]], and possibly the southern [[Leeward Islands]]. Historically, it was thought their ancestors were mainland Caribs who had conquered the islands from their previous inhabitants, the [[Igneri]]. However, linguistic and archaeological evidence contradicts the notion of a mass emigration and conquest; the Island Carib language appears not to have been [[Cariban languages|Cariban]], but like that of their neighbors, the [[Ta\u00edno]]. Irving Rouse and others suggest that a smaller group of mainland Caribs conquered the islands without displacing their inhabitants, eventually adopting the local language but retaining their traditions of a South American origin.<ref>{{cite book |last= Rouse |first= Irving |date= 1992 |title= The Tainos |url= https://archive.org/details/tainosrisedeclin00rous |url-access= registration |quote= Island Carib. |location= |publisher= Yale University Press |page= [https://archive.org/details/tainosrisedeclin00rous/page/21 21] |isbn= 0300051816 |accessdate= May 22, 2014}}</ref>\n\nIn the early colonial period, the Caribs had a reputation as warriors who raided neighboring islands.

Some claim there is evidence as to the taking of human trophies and the ritual cannibalism of war captives among both Carib and other Amerindian groups such as the [[Arawak]] and [[Tupinamba]]. Others argue Europeans misunderstood rituals, or falsely portrayed them to justify conquest and genocide. Today, the Caribs and their descendants continue to live in the Antilles, notably on the island of [[Dominica]]. The [[Garifuna people|Garifuna]] or \"[[Black Caribs]]\", a group of mixed Carib, Arawak and African ancestry, also live principally in Central America.\n\n==History==\nThe Caribs are believed to have migrated from the [[Orinoco]] River area in South America to settle in the Caribbean islands about 1200 AD, according to [[carbon dating]] {{Citation needed|date=July 2017}}. Over the two centuries leading up to [[Christopher Columbus]]' arrival in the Caribbean archipelago in 1492, the Caribs mostly displaced the [[Maipurean language|Maipurean]]-speaking [[Ta\u00ednos]] by warfare, extermination, and assimilation. The Ta\u00edno had settled the island chains earlier in history, migrating from the mainland.<ref>[http://www.diaspora.uiuc.edu/news0307/news0307-7.pdf Sweeney, James L.

None of the insular Amerindians mined for gold but obtained it by trade from the mainland. The Caribs were skilled boat builders and sailors. They appeared to have owed their dominance in the Caribbean basin to their mastery of warfare.\n\nAccording to Floyd, \"The question arose in [[Christopher Columbus|Columbus's]] time whether Indians could be enslaved and [[Isabella I of Castile|Queen Isabel]] had ruled against it.  At about the same time, however, [[Alonso de Ojeda|Ojeda]], [[Rodrigo de Bastidas|Bastidas]], and other explorers voyaging along the [[Spanish Main]] had been attacked by Indians with poisoned arrows - all such Indians were considered Caribs - which took a considerable toll of Spanish lives.

The most famous form is [[punta]].  Its associated musical style, which has the dancers move their hips in a circular motion. An evolved form of traditional music, still usually played using traditional instruments, punta has seen some modernization and electrification in the 1970s; this is called [[punta rock]].  Traditional punta dancing is consciously competitive. Artists like [[Pen Cayetano]] helped innovate modern punta rock by adding [[guitar]]s to the traditional music, and paved the way for later artists like [[Andy Palacio]], [[Children of the Most High]] and [[Black Coral]]. Punta was popular across the region, especially in Belize, by the mid-1980s, culminating in the release of ''[[Punta Rockers]]'' in 1987, a compilation featuring many of the genre's biggest stars.\n\nOther forms of Garifuna music and dance include: hungu-hungu, combination, wanaragua, abaimahani, matamuerte, laremuna wadaguman, gunjai, sambai, charikanari, eremuna egi, paranda, berusu, punta rock, teremuna ligilisi, arumahani, and Mali-amalihani. Punta is the most popular dance in Garifuna culture.  It is performed around holidays and at parties and other social events. Punta lyrics are usually composed by the women. [[Chumba]] and [[hunguhungu]] are a circular dance in a three-beat rhythm, which is often combined with punta. There are other songs typical to each gender, women having [[eremwu eu]] and [[abaimajani]], rhythmic [[a cappella]] songs, and [[laremuna wadaguman]], men's [[work song]]s, [[chumba]] and [[hunguhungu]], a circular dance in a three-beat rhythm, which is often combined with punta.\n\nDrums play a very important role in Garifuna music. There are primarily two types of drums used: the ''primero'' (tenor drum) and the ''segunda'' (bass drum). These drums are typically made of hollowed-out hardwood such as mahogany or mayflower, with the skins coming from the peccary (wild bush pig), deer, or sheep.\n\nAlso used in combination with the drums are the ''sisera''. These shakers are made from the dried fruit of the gourd tree, filled with seeds, then fitted with hardwood handles.\n\nParanda music developed soon after the Garifunas arrival in Central America. The music is instrumental and [[percussion instrument|percussion]]-based.  The music was barely recorded until the 1990s, when [[Ivan Duran]] of [[Stonetree Records]] began the [[Paranda Project]].\n\nIn contemporary Belize there has been a resurgence of Garifuna music, popularized by musicians such as Andy Palacio, Mohobub Flores, & Adrian Martinez. These musicians have taken many aspects from traditional Garifuna music forms and fused them with more modern sounds. Described as a mixture of punta rock and paranda. One great example is Andy Palacio's album ''Watina'', and ''Umalali: The Garifuna Women's Project'', both released on the Belizean record label Stonetree Records.\n\nIn the Garifuna culture, there is another dance called Dugu. This dance is a ritual done for a death in the family to pay their respect to their loved ones. In 2001, Garifuna music was proclaimed one of the [[masterpieces of the oral and intangible heritage of humanity]] by [[UNESCO]].\n\n==Ancestral honor==\n\nThe [[Island Carib language|Island Carib]] word ''karibna'' meant \"person\".

For a sprain, oils from coconuts, snakes, and bay leaves are used to heal the injury.  In Carib history, a more extensive use of plant and animal products were used for medicine, but with modernization and discovery of more effective and safe techniques, more Caribs are seen using local hospitals today.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Regan |first1=Seann |title=Healthcare Use Patterns in Dominica: Ethnomedical Integration in an Era of Biomedicine |url=https://etd.ohiolink.edu/!etd.send_file?accession=miami1281448409&disposition=inline}}</ref>\n\n==Kalinago canoe project==\nIn 1997 [[Dominica]] Carib artist Jacob Frederick and [[Tortola]] artist Aragorn Dick Read joined forces and set out to build a traditional canoe based on the fishing canoes still used in Dominica, [[Guadeloupe]] and [[Martinique]].

Historically, it was thought their ancestors were mainland Caribs who had conquered the islands from their previous inhabitants, the [[Igneri]]. However, linguistic and archaeological evidence contradicts the notion of a mass emigration and conquest; the Island Carib language appears not to have been [[Cariban languages|Cariban]], but like that of their neighbors, the [[Ta\u00edno]]. Irving Rouse and others suggest that a smaller group of mainland Caribs conquered the islands without displacing their inhabitants, eventually adopting the local language but retaining their traditions of a South American origin.<ref>{{cite book |last= Rouse |first= Irving |date= 1992 |title= The Tainos |url= https://archive.org/details/tainosrisedeclin00rous |url-access= registration |quote= Island Carib. |location= |publisher= Yale University Press |page= [https://archive.org/details/tainosrisedeclin00rous/page/21 21] |isbn= 0300051816 |accessdate= May 22, 2014}}</ref>\n\nIn the early colonial period, the Caribs had a reputation as warriors who raided neighboring islands.

Some claim there is evidence as to the taking of human trophies and the ritual cannibalism of war captives among both Carib and other Amerindian groups such as the [[Arawak]] and [[Tupinamba]]. Others argue Europeans misunderstood rituals, or falsely portrayed them to justify conquest and genocide. Today, the Caribs and their descendants continue to live in the Antilles, notably on the island of [[Dominica]]. The [[Garifuna people|Garifuna]] or \"[[Black Caribs]]\", a group of mixed Carib, Arawak and African ancestry, also live principally in Central America.\n\n==History==\nThe Caribs are believed to have migrated from the [[Orinoco]] River area in South America to settle in the Caribbean islands about 1200 AD, according to [[carbon dating]] {{Citation needed|date=July 2017}}. Over the two centuries leading up to [[Christopher Columbus]]' arrival in the Caribbean archipelago in 1492, the Caribs mostly displaced the [[Maipurean language|Maipurean]]-speaking [[Ta\u00ednos]] by warfare, extermination, and assimilation.

The most famous form is [[punta]].  Its associated musical style, which has the dancers move their hips in a circular motion. An evolved form of traditional music, still usually played using traditional instruments, punta has seen some modernization and electrification in the 1970s; this is called [[punta rock]].  Traditional punta dancing is consciously competitive. Artists like [[Pen Cayetano]] helped innovate modern punta rock by adding [[guitar]]s to the traditional music, and paved the way for later artists like [[Andy Palacio]], [[Children of the Most High]] and [[Black Coral]]. Punta was popular across the region, especially in Belize, by the mid-1980s, culminating in the release of ''[[Punta Rockers]]'' in 1987, a compilation featuring many of the genre's biggest stars.\n\nOther forms of Garifuna music and dance include: hungu-hungu, combination, wanaragua, abaimahani, matamuerte, laremuna wadaguman, gunjai, sambai, charikanari, eremuna egi, paranda, berusu, punta rock, teremuna ligilisi, arumahani, and Mali-amalihani. Punta is the most popular dance in Garifuna culture.  It is performed around holidays and at parties and other social events. Punta lyrics are usually composed by the women. [[Chumba]] and [[hunguhungu]] are a circular dance in a three-beat rhythm, which is often combined with punta. There are other songs typical to each gender, women having [[eremwu eu]] and [[abaimajani]], rhythmic [[a cappella]] songs, and [[laremuna wadaguman]], men's [[work song]]s, [[chumba]] and [[hunguhungu]], a circular dance in a three-beat rhythm, which is often combined with punta.\n\nDrums play a very important role in Garifuna music. There are primarily two types of drums used: the ''primero'' (tenor drum) and the ''segunda'' (bass drum). These drums are typically made of hollowed-out hardwood such as mahogany or mayflower, with the skins coming from the peccary (wild bush pig), deer, or sheep.\n\nAlso used in combination with the drums are the ''sisera''. These shakers are made from the dried fruit of the gourd tree, filled with seeds, then fitted with hardwood handles.\n\nParanda music developed soon after the Garifunas arrival in Central America. The music is instrumental and [[percussion instrument|percussion]]-based.  The music was barely recorded until the 1990s, when [[Ivan Duran]] of [[Stonetree Records]] began the [[Paranda Project]].\n\nIn contemporary Belize there has been a resurgence of Garifuna music, popularized by musicians such as Andy Palacio, Mohobub Flores, & Adrian Martinez. These musicians have taken many aspects from traditional Garifuna music forms and fused them with more modern sounds. Described as a mixture of punta rock and paranda. One great example is Andy Palacio's album ''Watina'', and ''Umalali: The Garifuna Women's Project'', both released on the Belizean record label Stonetree Records.\n\nIn the Garifuna culture, there is another dance called Dugu. This dance is a ritual done for a death in the family to pay their respect to their loved ones. In 2001, Garifuna music was proclaimed one of the [[masterpieces of the oral and intangible heritage of humanity]] by [[UNESCO]].\n\n==Ancestral honor==\n\nThe [[Island Carib language|Island Carib]] word ''karibna'' meant \"person\". It became the origin of the English \"cannibal\".<ref>{{cite web|last1=Harper|first1=Douglas|title=Cannibal|url=http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=cannibal|website=Online Etymological Dictionary|accessdate=12 February 2015|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150212222145/http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=cannibal|archivedate=12 February 2015}}</ref> Although, among the Caribs, it was apparently associated with rituals related to the eating of war enemies.

[[Missionaries]], such as P\u00e8re [[Jean Baptiste Labat]] and [[Cesar de Rochefort]], described the practice as part of a belief that the ancestral spirits would always look after the bones and protect their descendants. The Caribs have been described as vicious and violent people in the history of the people who battled against other tribes.

Today, a combination of bush medicine and modern medicine is used by the Caribs of Dominica.  For example, various fruits and leaves are used to heal common ailments.  For a sprain, oils from coconuts, snakes, and bay leaves are used to heal the injury.  In Carib history, a more extensive use of plant and animal products were used for medicine, but with modernization and discovery of more effective and safe techniques, more Caribs are seen using local hospitals today.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Regan |first1=Seann |title=Healthcare Use Patterns in Dominica: Ethnomedical Integration in an Era of Biomedicine |url=https://etd.ohiolink.edu/!etd.send_file?accession=miami1281448409&disposition=inline}}</ref>\n\n==Kalinago canoe project==\nIn 1997 [[Dominica]] Carib artist Jacob Frederick and [[Tortola]] artist Aragorn Dick Read joined forces and set out to build a traditional canoe based on the fishing canoes still used in Dominica, [[Guadeloupe]] and [[Martinique]]. The project consisted of a return voyage by canoe to the Orinoco delta to meet up with the Kalinago tribes still living in those parts.

After a successful course of study at the [[Coll\u00e8ge-lyc\u00e9e Jacques-Decour|Coll\u00e8ge Rollin]], he went to [[University of Munich|Munich]] in autumn 1839, where he attended the lectures of [[Friedrich Wilhelm Joseph Schelling|Schelling]], and took his degree in philosophy in 1836. In the following year he published the first volume of his famous work ''Essai sur la m\u00e9taphysique d'Aristote'' (\"Essay on the Metaphysics of Aristotle\"), to which in 1846 he added a supplementary volume. This work not only criticizes and comments on the theories of [[Aristotle]] and the [[Peripatetic school|Peripatetic]]s, but also develops from them a modern philosophical system.\n\nIn 1838 he received his doctorate, his thesis entitled \"De l'habitude\" (\"On Habit\"), which was to become a classic text (a metaphysical 'poem' on nature in general apprehended through an intuitive analysis of acquired habit as a particular manifestation of its essential being, much admired by Bergson and Heidegger), and became professor of philosophy at [[Rennes]]. From 1840 he was inspector-general of public libraries, and in 1860 became inspector-general in the department of higher education. He was also a member of the [[Acad\u00e9mie des Sciences Morales et Politiques|Academy of Moral and Political Sciences]], and curator of the Department of Antiquities at the [[Louvre]] (from 1870). He died in [[Paris]].\n\nIn philosophy, he was one of the school of [[Victor Cousin]], with whom he was at issue in many important points. The act of consciousness, according to him, is the basis of all knowledge. Acts of consciousness are manifestations of will, which is the motive and creative power of the intellectual life. The idea of God is a cumulative intuition given by all the various faculties of the mind, in its observation of harmony in nature and in man. This theory had considerable influence on speculative philosophy in France during the later years of the 19th century.\n\n==Bibliography==\n\nRavaisson's 'complete' 'three major' philosophical works are: ''Essai sur la m\u00e9taphysique d\u2019Aristote'' [Vol. 1 & Vol. 2] (1837 and 1846); ''De l\u2019habitude'' (''On Habit'', 1838); and ''Rapport sur la philosophie en France au XIXeme si\u00e8cle'' (1867).<ref name=\"SinclairBI-6\">\"Sinclair (2019), p. 6</ref><ref name=\"Carlisle&Sinclair-4-5\">\"Carlisle & Sinclair (2008), pp. 4-5</ref> Ravaisson also produced a number of other 'noteworthy essays' such as \"La Philosophie contemporaine\" (\"Contemporary Philosophy\", 1840); \"La Philosophie de Pascale\" (\"Pascal\u2019s Philosophy\", 1887), and \"M\u00e9taphysique et Morale\" (\"Metaphysics and Morals\", 1893).<ref name=\"Carlisle&Sinclair-5\">\"Carlisle & Sinclair (2008), p. 5</ref> Upon his death he also 'left unfinished fragments of a major work, which were published posthumously', first as \"Testament philosophique\" in ''Revue de m\u00e9taphysique et de morale'' (\"Philosophical Testament\", 1901), then later in extended form as ''Testament philosophique'' (''Philosophical Testament'', 1933).<ref name=\"Carlisle&Sinclair-5\">\"Carlisle & Sinclair (2008), p. 5</ref><ref name=\"SinclairI-vii\">\"Sinclair (2016), p. vii</ref>\n\n{|class=\"wikitable\" style=\"border:none\"\n|-\n!

After a successful course of study at the [[Coll\u00e8ge-lyc\u00e9e Jacques-Decour|Coll\u00e8ge Rollin]], he went to [[University of Munich|Munich]] in autumn 1839, where he attended the lectures of [[Friedrich Wilhelm Joseph Schelling|Schelling]], and took his degree in philosophy in 1836. In the following year he published the first volume of his famous work ''Essai sur la m\u00e9taphysique d'Aristote'' (\"Essay on the Metaphysics of Aristotle\"), to which in 1846 he added a supplementary volume. This work not only criticizes and comments on the theories of [[Aristotle]] and the [[Peripatetic school|Peripatetic]]s, but also develops from them a modern philosophical system.\n\nIn 1838 he received his doctorate, his thesis entitled \"De l'habitude\" (\"On Habit\"), which was to become a classic text (a metaphysical 'poem' on nature in general apprehended through an intuitive analysis of acquired habit as a particular manifestation of its essential being, much admired by Bergson and Heidegger), and became professor of philosophy at [[Rennes]]. From 1840 he was inspector-general of public libraries, and in 1860 became inspector-general in the department of higher education. He was also a member of the [[Acad\u00e9mie des Sciences Morales et Politiques|Academy of Moral and Political Sciences]], and curator of the Department of Antiquities at the [[Louvre]] (from 1870). He died in [[Paris]].\n\nIn philosophy, he was one of the school of [[Victor Cousin]], with whom he was at issue in many important points. The act of consciousness, according to him, is the basis of all knowledge. Acts of consciousness are manifestations of will, which is the motive and creative power of the intellectual life. The idea of God is a cumulative intuition given by all the various faculties of the mind, in its observation of harmony in nature and in man. This theory had considerable influence on speculative philosophy in France during the later years of the 19th century.\n\n==Bibliography==\n\nRavaisson\u2019s 'complete' 'three major' philosophical works are: ''Essai sur la m\u00e9taphysique d\u2019Aristote'' [Vol. 1 & Vol. 2] (1837 and 1846); ''De l\u2019habitude'' (''On Habit'', 1838); and ''Rapport sur la philosophie en France au XIXeme si\u00e8cle'' (1867).<ref name=\"SinclairBI-6\">\"Sinclair (2019), p. 6</ref><ref name=\"Carlisle&Sinclair-4-5\">\"Carlisle & Sinclair (2008), pp. 4-5</ref> Ravaisson also produced a number of other 'noteworthy essays' such as \"La Philosophie contemporaine\" (\"Contemporary Philosophy\", 1840); \"La Philosophie de Pascale\" (\"Pascal\u2019s Philosophy\", 1887), and \"M\u00e9taphysique et Morale\" (\"Metaphysics and Morals\", 1893).<ref name=\"Carlisle&Sinclair-5\">\"Carlisle & Sinclair (2008), p. 5</ref> Upon his death he also 'left unfinished fragments of a major work, which were published posthumously', first as \"Testament philosophique\" in ''Revue de m\u00e9taphysique et de morale'' (\"Philosophical Testament\", 1901), then later in extended form as ''Testament philosophique'' (''Philosophical Testament'', 1933).<ref name=\"Carlisle&Sinclair-5\">\"Carlisle & Sinclair (2008), p. 5</ref><ref name=\"SinclairI-vii\">\"Sinclair (2016), p. vii</ref>\n\n{|class=\"wikitable\" style=\"border:none\"\n|-\n!

He is notable for his 1920 book ''[[The Animate and the Inanimate]]'', in which he postulates the existence of [[dark matter]], [[entropy]], and the origin of life in the context of [[thermodynamics]]. Sidis was raised in a particular manner by his father, psychologist [[Boris Sidis]], who wished his son to be gifted. Sidis first became famous for his precocity and later for his [[Eccentricity (behavior)|eccentricity]] and withdrawal from public life. Eventually, he avoided mathematics altogether, writing on other subjects under a number of [[pseudonym]]s. He entered [[Harvard University|Harvard]] at age 11 and, as an adult, was claimed to have an extremely high IQ, and to be conversant in about 25 languages and dialects. Some of these claims have not been verified, but many of his contemporaries, including [[Norbert Wiener]], [[Daniel Frost Comstock]] and [[William James]], supported the assertion that he was extremely intelligent.\n\n==Biography==\n\n===Parents and upbringing (1898\u20131908)===\nWilliam James Sidis was born to Jewish emigrants from Ukraine,<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.todayifoundout.com/index.php/2013/12/genius-among-us-sad-story-william-j-sidis/|title=A Genius Among Us: The Sad Story of William J.

In early 1910, Sidis' mastery of higher mathematics was such that he lectured the Harvard Mathematical Club on [[Four-dimensional space|four-dimensional bodies]] which brought him nationwide attention.<ref>{{cite journal| url= https://psycnet.apa.org/record/1977-31409-001| via= APA.org| title= William James Sidis, the broken twig| last= Montour| first= Kathleen| work= [[American Psychologist]]| volume= 32| number= 4| pages= 265\u2013279| doi= 10.1037/0003-066X.32.4.265| date= April 1977| access-date= February 13, 2020}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|title=Wonderful Boys of History Compared With Sidis.

He granted an interview to a reporter from the ''[[Boston Herald]]''. The paper reported Sidis's vows to remain [[Celibacy|celibate]] and never to marry, as he said women did not appeal to him. Later he developed a strong affection for a young woman named [[Martha Foley]]. He later enrolled at [[Harvard Graduate School of Arts and Sciences]].\n\nAccording to ''The Prodigy: a Biography of William James Sidis'', he briefly served at the [[League of Nations]] before leaving because U.S. president [[Woodrow Wilson]] would not withdraw troops deployed during [[World War I|the Great War]]. He was outspoken about his [[pacifism]].\n\n===Teaching and further education (1915\u20131919)===\nAfter a group of Harvard students threatened Sidis physically, his parents secured him a job at the [[William Marsh Rice]] Institute for the Advancement of Letters, Science, and Art (now [[Rice University]]) in [[Houston, Texas]], as a mathematics teaching assistant. He arrived at Rice in December 1915 at the age of 17. He was a graduate fellow working toward his doctorate.\n\nSidis taught three classes: [[Euclidean geometry]], [[non-Euclidean geometry]], and freshman math (he wrote a textbook for the Euclidean geometry course in Greek).<ref name= Wallace />{{rp|112}} After less than a year, frustrated with the department, his teaching requirements, and his treatment by students older than himself, Sidis left his post and returned to New England.

He was sentenced to 18 months in prison under the [[Sedition Act of 1918]] by Roxbury Municipal Court Judge [[Albert F Hayden]]. Sidis' arrest featured prominently in newspapers, as his early graduation from Harvard had garnered considerable local celebrity status. During the trial, Sidis stated that he had been a [[conscientious objector]] to the [[World War I]] draft, was a [[socialism|socialist]], and did not believe in a god like the \"big boss of the Christians,\" but rather in something that is in a way apart from a human being.<ref>{{cite news|title=Sidis Gets Year and Half in Jail|url=http://www.sidis.net/herald1919.htm |accessdate= January 12, 2018 |work= [[Boston Herald]] |date=May 14, 1919|quote='Do you believe in a god?'

He only took work running adding machines or other fairly menial tasks. He worked in New York City and became estranged from his parents.

He obsessively collected streetcar [[Transfer (public transit)|transfers]], wrote self-published periodicals, and taught small circles of interested friends his version of American history.

Everything outside of what we would today call a [[galaxy]] would be such a region. Sidis claimed that the matter in this region would not generate light. Sidis's ''[[The Tribes and the States]]'' (ca. 1935) employs the [[pseudonym]] \"John W.

He granted an interview to a reporter from the ''[[Boston Herald]]''. The paper reported Sidis's vows to remain [[Celibacy|celibate]] and never to marry, as he said women did not appeal to him. Later he developed a strong affection for a young woman named [[Martha Foley]]. He later enrolled at [[Harvard Graduate School of Arts and Sciences]].\n\nAccording to ''The Prodigy: a Biography of William James Sidis'', he briefly served at the [[League of Nations]] before leaving because U.S. president [[Woodrow Wilson]] would not withdraw troops deployed during [[World War I|the Great War]].

He was sentenced to 18 months in prison under the [[Sedition Act of 1918]] by Roxbury Municipal Court Judge [[Albert F Hayden]]. Sidis' arrest featured prominently in newspapers, as his early graduation from Harvard had garnered considerable local celebrity status. During the trial, Sidis stated that he had been a [[conscientious objector]] to the [[World War I]] draft, was a [[socialism|socialist]], and did not believe in a god like the \"big boss of the Christians,\" but rather in something that is in a way apart from a human being.<ref>{{cite news|title=Sidis Gets Year and Half in Jail|url=http://www.sidis.net/herald1919.htm |accessdate= January 12, 2018 |work= [[Boston Herald]] |date=May 14, 1919|quote='Do you believe in a god?'

Sidis's ''[[The Tribes and the States]]'' (ca. 1935) employs the [[pseudonym]] \"John W.

He was educated in [[English literature]] at [[College of the Holy Cross|Holy Cross College]], a Catholic college in [[Massachusetts]], and after graduation spent two years in [[San Francisco, California|San Francisco]] doing law-related work.

{"title_page": "Intelligence", "text_new": "{{pp-protected|small=yes}}\n{{About||the human faculty of thinking and understanding|Intellect|human intelligence|Human intelligence|other uses}}\n{{Intellectualism sidebar}}\n'''Intelligence''' has been defined in many ways: the capacity for [[logic]], [[understanding]], [[self-awareness]], [[learning]], [[emotional knowledge]], [[reason]]ing, [[planning]], [[creativity]], [[critical thinking]], and [[problem-solving]]. More generally, it can be described as the ability to perceive or infer [[information]], and to retain it as [[knowledge]] to be applied towards adaptive behaviors within an environment or context.\n\nIntelligence is most often studied in humans but has also been observed in both non-human animals and in [[plant intelligence|plants]]. Intelligence in machines is called [[artificial intelligence]], which is commonly implemented in [[computer system]]s using [[Computer program|programs]] and, sometimes, specialized [[Computer hardware|hardware]].\n{{TOC limit|limit=3}}\n\n== History of the term ==\n{{Main|Nous}}\nThe word \"''[[wikt:intelligence#English|Intelligence]]''\" derives from the Latin [[noun]]s ''[[wikt:intelligentia|intelligentia]]'' or ''[[wikt:intellectus|intell\u0113ctus]]'', which in turn stem from the verb ''[[wikt:intelligere|intelligere]]'', to comprehend or perceive. In the [[Middle Ages]], the word ''intellectus'' became the scholarly technical term for understanding, and a translation for the Greek philosophical term ''[[nous]]''. This term, however, was strongly linked to the [[metaphysics|metaphysical]] and [[cosmology|cosmological]] theories of [[teleology|teleological]] [[scholasticism]], including theories of the immortality of the soul, and the concept of the [[Active Intellect]] (also known as the Active Intelligence). This entire approach to the study of nature was strongly rejected by the [[early modern era|early modern]] philosophers such as [[Francis Bacon]], [[Thomas Hobbes]], [[John Locke]], and [[David Hume]], all of whom preferred the word \"understanding\" (in place of \"''intellectus''\" or \"intelligence\") in their English philosophical works.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Maich|page=305|title=A Hobbes Dictionary|first=Aloysius|publisher=Blackwell|year=1995}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book|last=Nidditch|first=Peter|chapter=Foreword|page=xxii|publisher=Oxford University Press|title=An Essay Concerning Human Understanding}}</ref> Hobbes for example, in his Latin ''[[De Corpore]]'', used \"''intellectus intelligit''\", translated in the English version as \"the understanding understandeth\", as a typical example of a logical [[absurdity]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://archive.org/details/thomhobbesmalme03molegoog|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131105204954/http://www.archive.org/stream/thomhobbesmalme03molegoog|url-status=dead|title=Opera philosophica qu\u00e6 latine scripsit omnia, in unum corpus nunc primum collecta studio et labore Gulielmi Molesworth ..|first1=Thomas|last1=Hobbes|first2=William|last2=Molesworth|date=15 February 1839|archivedate=5 November 2013|publisher=Londoni, apud Joannem Bohn|via=Internet Archive}}</ref> The term \"intelligence\" has therefore become less common in English language philosophy, but it has later been taken up (with the scholastic theories which it now implies) in more contemporary [[psychology]].<ref>This paragraph almost verbatim from {{cite book|last1=Goldstein|first1=Sam|last2=Princiotta|first2=Dana|last3=Naglieri|first3=Jack A., Eds.|title=Handbook of Intelligence: Evolutionary Theory, Historical Perspective, and Current Concepts|date=2015|publisher=Springer|location=New York, Heidelberg, Dordrecht, London|isbn=978-1-4939-1561-3|page=3}}</ref>\n\n== Definitions ==\nThe [[definition]] of intelligence is controversial.<ref name=\"LeggHutter2007\">{{cite book\n |author1=S.

It is a cognitive process. It gives humans the [[cognition|cognitive]] abilities to [[learning|learn]], [[Concept learning|form concepts]], [[understanding|understand]], and [[reason]], including the capacities to [[pattern recognition|recognize patterns]], innovate, [[planning|plan]], [[problem solving|solve problems]], and employ [[language]] to [[Human communication|communicate]]. Intelligence enables humans to [[experience]] and [[thought|think]].\n\nMuch of the above definition applies also to the intelligence of non-human animals.\n\n== Nonhuman animal intelligence ==\n{{Main|Animal cognition}}\n[[File:Chimpanzee and stick.jpg|250px|thumb|right|The common [[Common chimpanzee|chimpanzee]] can [[Tool use by animals|use tools]]. This chimpanzee is using a stick to get food.]]\n\nAlthough humans have been the primary focus of intelligence researchers, scientists have also attempted to investigate animal intelligence, or more broadly, animal [[cognition]]. These researchers are interested in studying both mental ability in a particular [[species]], and comparing abilities between species. They study various measures of problem solving, as well as numerical and verbal reasoning abilities. Some challenges in this area are defining intelligence so that it has the same meaning across species (e.g. comparing intelligence between literate humans and illiterate animals), and also [[operational definition|operationalizing]] a measure that accurately compares mental ability across different species and contexts.\n\n[[Wolfgang K\u00f6hler]]'s research on the intelligence of apes is an example of research in this area. Stanley Coren's book, ''[[The Intelligence of Dogs]]'' is a notable book on the topic of dog intelligence.<ref>{{Cite book |last=Coren |first=Stanley |title=The Intelligence of Dogs |publisher=Bantam Books |isbn=978-0-553-37452-0 |year=1995 |oclc=30700778 |url=https://archive.org/details/intelligenceofdo00core }}</ref> (See also: [[Dog intelligence]].) Non-human animals particularly noted and studied for their intelligence include [[Common chimpanzee|chimpanzee]]s, [[bonobo]]s (notably the language-using [[Kanzi]]) and other [[great ape]]s, [[dolphin]]s, [[elephant]]s and to some extent [[parrot]]s, [[Rat IQ|rats]] and [[raven]]s.\n\n[[Cephalopod intelligence]] also provides important comparative study. [[Cephalopod]]s appear to exhibit characteristics of significant intelligence, yet their [[nervous system]]s differ radically from those of backboned animals. Vertebrates such as [[mammal]]s, [[bird]]s, [[reptile]]s and [[fish]] have shown a fairly high degree of intellect that varies according to each species. The same is true with [[arthropod]]s.\n\n=== ''g'' factor in non-humans ===\n{{main|g Factor in Non-Humans}}\n\nEvidence of a general factor of intelligence has been observed in non-human animals. The general factor of intelligence, or [[g factor (psychometrics)|''g'' factor]], is a [[psychometric]] construct that summarizes the correlations observed between an individual's scores on a wide range of [[cognitive abilities]]. First described in [[humans]], the ''g'' factor has since been identified in a number of non-human species.<ref name=\"Reader\">Reader, S. M., Hager, Y., & Laland, K. N. (2011). The evolution of primate general and cultural intelligence. Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society B: Biological Sciences, 366(1567), 1017\u20131027.</ref>\n\nCognitive ability and intelligence cannot be measured using the same, largely verbally dependent, scales developed for humans. Instead, intelligence is measured using a variety of interactive and observational tools focusing on [[innovation]], [[habit]] reversal, [[social learning theory|social learning]], and responses to [[novelty]]. Studies have shown that ''g'' is responsible for 47% of the individual variance in cognitive ability measures in [[primates]]<ref name=\"Reader\" /> and between 55% and 60% of the variance in [[mus musculus|mice]] (Locurto, Locurto). These values are similar to the accepted variance in [[IQ]] explained by ''g'' in humans (40\u201350%).<ref>Kamphaus, R. W. (2005). Clinical assessment of child and adolescent intelligence. Springer Science & Business Media.</ref>\n\n== Plant intelligence ==\n{{Main|Plant perception (physiology)#Plant cognition|Plant cognition}}\n\nIt has been argued that plants should also be classified as intelligent based on their ability to sense and model external and internal environments and adjust their [[morphology (biology)|morphology]], [[plant physiology|physiology]] and [[phenotypic plasticity|phenotype]] accordingly to ensure self-preservation and reproduction.<ref>{{Cite journal |last=Trewavas |first=Anthony |date = September 2005|title=Green plants as intelligent organisms |journal=Trends in Plant Science |pmid=16054860 |volume=10 |issue=9 |pages=413\u2013419 |doi=10.1016/j.tplants.2005.07.005}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal| page = 841| year = 2002| pmid = 11859344| doi = 10.1038/415841a| issue = 6874| volume = 415| title = Mindless mastery| journal = Nature| last1 = Trewavas | first1 = A.| bibcode = 2002Natur.415..841T}}</ref>\n\nA counter argument is that intelligence is commonly understood to involve the creation and use of persistent memories as opposed to computation that does not involve learning. If this is accepted as definitive of intelligence, then it includes the artificial intelligence of robots capable of \"machine learning\", but excludes those purely autonomic sense-reaction responses that can be observed in many plants. Plants are not limited to automated sensory-motor responses, however, they are capable of discriminating positive and negative experiences and of \"learning\" (registering memories) from their past experiences. They are also capable of communication, accurately computing their circumstances, using sophisticated [[cost\u2013benefit analysis]] and taking tightly controlled actions to mitigate and control the diverse environmental stressors.<ref>{{Cite journal | last1 = Goh | first1 = C.

In the [[Middle Ages]], the word ''intellectus'' became the scholarly technical term for understanding, and a translation for the Greek philosophical term ''[[nous]]''. This term, however, was strongly linked to the [[metaphysics|metaphysical]] and [[cosmology|cosmological]] theories of [[teleology|teleological]] [[scholasticism]], including theories of the immortality of the soul, and the concept of the [[Active Intellect]] (also known as the Active Intelligence). This entire approach to the study of nature was strongly rejected by the [[early modern era|early modern]] philosophers such as [[Francis Bacon]], [[Thomas Hobbes]], [[John Locke]], and [[David Hume]], all of whom preferred the word \"understanding\" (in place of \"''intellectus''\" or \"intelligence\") in their English philosophical works.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Maich|page=305|title=A Hobbes Dictionary|first=Aloysius|publisher=Blackwell|year=1995}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book|last=Nidditch|first=Peter|chapter=Foreword|page=xxii|publisher=Oxford University Press|title=An Essay Concerning Human Understanding}}</ref> Hobbes for example, in his Latin ''[[De Corpore]]'', used \"''intellectus intelligit''\", translated in the English version as \"the understanding understandeth\", as a typical example of a logical [[absurdity]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://archive.org/details/thomhobbesmalme03molegoog|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131105204954/http://www.archive.org/stream/thomhobbesmalme03molegoog|url-status=dead|title=Opera philosophica qu\u00e6 latine scripsit omnia, in unum corpus nunc primum collecta studio et labore Gulielmi Molesworth ..|first1=Thomas|last1=Hobbes|first2=William|last2=Molesworth|date=15 February 1839|archivedate=5 November 2013|publisher=Londoni, apud Joannem Bohn|via=Internet Archive}}</ref> The term \"intelligence\" has therefore become less common in English language philosophy, but it has later been taken up (with the scholastic theories which it now implies) in more contemporary [[psychology]].<ref>This paragraph almost verbatim from {{cite book|last1=Goldstein|first1=Sam|last2=Princiotta|first2=Dana|last3=Naglieri|first3=Jack A., Eds.|title=Handbook of Intelligence: Evolutionary Theory, Historical Perspective, and Current Concepts|date=2015|publisher=Springer|location=New York, Heidelberg, Dordrecht, London|isbn=978-1-4939-1561-3|page=3}}</ref>\n\n== Definitions ==\nThe [[definition]] of intelligence is controversial.<ref name=\"LeggHutter2007\">{{cite book\n |author1=S.

It is a cognitive process. It gives humans the [[cognition|cognitive]] abilities to [[learning|learn]], [[Concept learning|form concepts]], [[understanding|understand]], and [[reason]], including the capacities to [[pattern recognition|recognize patterns]], comprehend ideas, [[planning|plan]], [[problem solving|solve problems]], and use [[language]] to [[Human communication|communicate]]. Intelligence enables humans to [[experience]] and [[thought|think]].\n\nMuch of the above definition applies also to the intelligence of non-human animals.\n\n== Nonhuman animal intelligence ==\n{{Main|Animal cognition}}\n[[File:Chimpanzee and stick.jpg|250px|thumb|right|The common [[Common chimpanzee|chimpanzee]] can [[Tool use by animals|use tools]]. This chimpanzee is using a stick to get food.]]\n\nAlthough humans have been the primary focus of intelligence researchers, scientists have also attempted to investigate animal intelligence, or more broadly, animal [[cognition]]. These researchers are interested in studying both mental ability in a particular [[species]], and comparing abilities between species. They study various measures of problem solving, as well as numerical and verbal reasoning abilities. Some challenges in this area are defining intelligence so that it has the same meaning across species (e.g. comparing intelligence between literate humans and illiterate animals), and also [[operational definition|operationalizing]] a measure that accurately compares mental ability across different species and contexts.\n\n[[Wolfgang K\u00f6hler]]'s research on the intelligence of apes is an example of research in this area. Stanley Coren's book, ''[[The Intelligence of Dogs]]'' is a notable book on the topic of dog intelligence.<ref>{{Cite book |last=Coren |first=Stanley |title=The Intelligence of Dogs |publisher=Bantam Books |isbn=978-0-553-37452-0 |year=1995 |oclc=30700778 |url=https://archive.org/details/intelligenceofdo00core }}</ref> (See also: [[Dog intelligence]].) Non-human animals particularly noted and studied for their intelligence include [[Common chimpanzee|chimpanzee]]s, [[bonobo]]s (notably the language-using [[Kanzi]]) and other [[great ape]]s, [[dolphin]]s, [[elephant]]s and to some extent [[parrot]]s, [[Rat IQ|rats]] and [[raven]]s.\n\n[[Cephalopod intelligence]] also provides important comparative study. [[Cephalopod]]s appear to exhibit characteristics of significant intelligence, yet their [[nervous system]]s differ radically from those of backboned animals. Vertebrates such as [[mammal]]s, [[bird]]s, [[reptile]]s and [[fish]] have shown a fairly high degree of intellect that varies according to each species. The same is true with [[arthropod]]s.\n\n=== ''g'' factor in non-humans ===\n{{main|g Factor in Non-Humans}}\n\nEvidence of a general factor of intelligence has been observed in non-human animals. The general factor of intelligence, or [[g factor (psychometrics)|''g'' factor]], is a [[psychometric]] construct that summarizes the correlations observed between an individual's scores on a wide range of [[cognitive abilities]]. First described in [[humans]], the ''g'' factor has since been identified in a number of non-human species.<ref name=\"Reader\">Reader, S. M., Hager, Y., & Laland, K. N. (2011). The evolution of primate general and cultural intelligence. Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society B: Biological Sciences, 366(1567), 1017\u20131027.</ref>\n\nCognitive ability and intelligence cannot be measured using the same, largely verbally dependent, scales developed for humans. Instead, intelligence is measured using a variety of interactive and observational tools focusing on [[innovation]], [[habit]] reversal, [[social learning theory|social learning]], and responses to [[novelty]]. Studies have shown that ''g'' is responsible for 47% of the individual variance in cognitive ability measures in [[primates]]<ref name=\"Reader\" /> and between 55% and 60% of the variance in [[mus musculus|mice]] (Locurto, Locurto). These values are similar to the accepted variance in [[IQ]] explained by ''g'' in humans (40\u201350%).<ref>Kamphaus, R. W. (2005). Clinical assessment of child and adolescent intelligence. Springer Science & Business Media.</ref>\n\n== Plant intelligence ==\n{{Main|Plant perception (physiology)#Plant cognition|Plant cognition}}\n\nIt has been argued that plants should also be classified as intelligent based on their ability to sense and model external and internal environments and adjust their [[morphology (biology)|morphology]], [[plant physiology|physiology]] and [[phenotypic plasticity|phenotype]] accordingly to ensure self-preservation and reproduction.<ref>{{Cite journal |last=Trewavas |first=Anthony |date = September 2005|title=Green plants as intelligent organisms |journal=Trends in Plant Science |pmid=16054860 |volume=10 |issue=9 |pages=413\u2013419 |doi=10.1016/j.tplants.2005.07.005}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal| page = 841| year = 2002| pmid = 11859344| doi = 10.1038/415841a| issue = 6874| volume = 415| title = Mindless mastery| journal = Nature| last1 = Trewavas | first1 = A.| bibcode = 2002Natur.415..841T}}</ref>\n\nA counter argument is that intelligence is commonly understood to involve the creation and use of persistent memories as opposed to computation that does not involve learning. If this is accepted as definitive of intelligence, then it includes the artificial intelligence of robots capable of \"machine learning\", but excludes those purely autonomic sense-reaction responses that can be observed in many plants. Plants are not limited to automated sensory-motor responses, however, they are capable of discriminating positive and negative experiences and of \"learning\" (registering memories) from their past experiences. They are also capable of communication, accurately computing their circumstances, using sophisticated [[cost\u2013benefit analysis]] and taking tightly controlled actions to mitigate and control the diverse environmental stressors.<ref>{{Cite journal | last1 = Goh | first1 = C.
