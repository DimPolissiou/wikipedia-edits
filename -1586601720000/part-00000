After this, he lived with the Aborigines and functioned as an intermediary between them and the settlers. In 1797 Wilson returned to Sydney, claiming to have explored up to a hundred miles in all directions around Sydney, including across the mountains. His descriptions and observations were generally accurate, and it is possible that he had crossed the mountains via the Coxs River corridor, guided by the Aborigines.<ref>{{cite book |title=The Blue Mountains Rediscovered |author= |publisher= |location= |year= |pages=76\u201377 |isbn= }}</ref>\n\nGovernor Macquarie named both Coxs River and Coxs Pass in honour of [[William Cox (pioneer)|William Cox]], a military officer, roadmaker and builder.<ref name=adb/> In 1815 the naming of the Coxs River is mentioned:<ref>{{cite book |title=[[Historical Records of Australia]]|series= Series I |volume= Volume VIII |page=572 |date=24 June 1815 }}</ref>{{quotation|The junction of these two streams a very handsome river, now called by the Governor \"Cox's River\" which takes its course...and empties itself into the River Nepean...|''[[Historical Records of Australia]]'' (Series I, Volume VIII, p. 572).}}\n\n==Pollution==\n\nAs of 2008, there were concerns about water quality in upper Coxs River. Testing carried out by researchers from the Blue Mountains Conservation Society showed that this part of the river had high levels of heavy metals including zinc, copper and manganese, 125 times more sulphate than surrounding streams and only 5% of the oxygen that fish need. The [[pH level]], a test of acidity, was up to 1000 times higher than that of neighbouring creeks, while the river was 80 times as salty as it should be. The [[Sydney Catchment Authority]] confirmed that the test was accurate, but said the water gets safer to drink in the lower river, approaching Warragamba Dam. The [[Department of Environment and Climate Change (New South Wales)|Department of Environment and Climate Change]] stated that the contamination could be caused by [[Delta Electricity]]'s Wallerawang Power Station reusing its water as a result of drought. Delta stated that it was operating within the conditions of its licence.<ref>{{cite news |work=[[Sydney Morning Herald]] |title=River 'killed' by pollution feeds city water supply |date=2 December 2008 |page=5 |author=Cubby, Ben |accessdate=1 April 2013 |url=http://www.smh.com.au/articles/2008/12/01/1227979933075.html }}</ref>\n\nIn 2009, Dr Ian Wright of the [[University of Western Sydney]] reported that the water flowing into Coxs River contained high levels of copper, boron and other metals at \"many times\" the levels found upstream of the Wallerawang Power Station. High arsenic levels were found down stream of the plant, although it was diluted further downstream and was not thought to pose a risk to humans. The Blue Mountains Conservation Society was taking a case to the [[Land and Environment Court of New South Wales]] with the backing of Environment Defenders Office of New South Wales, intending to argue that Delta Electricity are polluting Coxs River. The Society also intended to challenge the New South Wales system of environmental licences. The Society's president, Tara Cameron, said: \"These licences are just licences to pollute.

regions of [[New South Wales]], [[Australia]].\n\n==Course and features==\nThe Coxs River rises in Gardiners Gap, within Ben Bullen State Forest, east of [[Cullen Bullen, New South Wales|Cullen Bullen]], and flows through the [[Megalong Valley]] and parts of the [[Greater Blue Mountains Area]] [[World Heritage Site]] including the [[Blue Mountains National Park|Blue Mountains]] and [[Kanangra-Boyd National Park|Kanangra-Boyd]] national parks, heading generally south and then east, joined by fifteen [[tributary|tributaries]] including the [[Little River (Oberon)|Little]],

Coxs River was the easiest way to cross the mountains, but this fact was unknown to the European settlers, for whom the mountains were a seemingly impassable barrier.{{citation needed|date=April 2013}}\n\nA former convict, John Wilson, may have been the first European to cross the Blue Mountains.<!--NOTE: it is NOT certain that Wilson was the first to cross the mountains; if you disagree, please provide references--> Wilson arrived with the [[First Fleet]] in 1788 as a [[convict]] and was released in 1792. After this, he lived with the Aborigines and functioned as an intermediary between them and the settlers. In 1797 Wilson returned to Sydney, claiming to have explored up to a hundred miles in all directions around Sydney, including across the mountains. His descriptions and observations were generally accurate, and it is possible that he had crossed the mountains via the Coxs River corridor, guided by the Aborigines.<ref>{{cite book |title=The Blue Mountains Rediscovered |author= |publisher= |location= |year= |pages=76\u201377 |isbn= }}</ref>\n\nGovernor Macquarie named both Coxs River and Coxs Pass in honour of [[William Cox (pioneer)|William Cox]], a military officer, roadmaker and builder.<ref name=adb/> In 1815 the naming of the Coxs River is mentioned:<ref>{{cite book |title=[[Historical Records of Australia]]|series= Series I |volume= Volume VIII |page=572 |date=24 June 1815 }}</ref>{{quotation|The junction of these two streams a very handsome river, now called by the Governor \"Cox's River\" which takes its course...and empties itself into the River Nepean...|''[[Historical Records of Australia]]'' (Series I, Volume VIII, p. 572).}}\n\n==Pollution==\n\nAs of 2008, there were concerns about water quality in upper Coxs River. Testing carried out by researchers from the Blue Mountains Conservation Society showed that this part of the river had high levels of heavy metals including zinc, copper and manganese, 125 times more sulphate than surrounding streams and only 5% of the oxygen that fish need. The [[pH level]], a test of acidity, was up to 1000 times higher than that of neighbouring creeks, while the river was 80 times as salty as it should be. The [[Sydney Catchment Authority]] confirmed that the test was accurate, but said the water gets safer to drink in the lower river, approaching Warragamba Dam. The [[Department of Environment and Climate Change (New South Wales)|Department of Environment and Climate Change]] stated that the contamination could be caused by [[Delta Electricity]]'s Wallerawang Power Station reusing its water as a result of drought. Delta stated that it was operating within the conditions of its licence.<ref>{{cite news |work=[[Sydney Morning Herald]] |title=River 'killed' by pollution feeds city water supply |date=2 December 2008 |page=5 |author=Cubby, Ben |accessdate=1 April 2013 |url=http://www.smh.com.au/articles/2008/12/01/1227979933075.html }}</ref>\n\nIn 2009, Dr Ian Wright of the [[University of Western Sydney]] reported that the water flowing into Coxs River contained high levels of copper, boron and other metals at \"many times\" the levels found upstream of the Wallerawang Power Station. High arsenic levels were found down stream of the plant, although it was diluted further downstream and was not thought to pose a risk to humans. The Blue Mountains Conservation Society was taking a case to the [[Land and Environment Court of New South Wales]] with the backing of Environment Defenders Office of New South Wales, intending to argue that Delta Electricity are polluting Coxs River. The Society also intended to challenge the New South Wales system of environmental licences. The Society's president, Tara Cameron, said: \"These licences are just licences to pollute. They are just allowing the status quo and making people feel good without actually protecting the environment.\"<ref>{{cite news |work=[[Sydney Morning Herald]] |title=Toxic metals threat |date=18 June 2009 |page=1 |author=Cubby, Ben |accessdate=1 April 2013 |url=http://www.smh.com.au/environment/water-issues/toxic-metals-threat-20090617-chxk.html }}</ref> Journalists Ben Cubby and Erik Jensen maintained that the [[Government of New South Wales|NSW Government]] had known about the pollution for over two years.<ref>{{cite news |work=[[Sydney Morning Herald]] |title=Labor knew about toxic water threat |date=19 June 2009 |page=1 |author1=Cubby, Ben |author2=Jensen, Erik |accessdate=1 April 2013 |url=http://www.smh.com.au/environment/water-issues/labor-knew-about-toxic-water-threat-20090618-cm02.html }}</ref>\n\n==Activities and access==\nA range of leisure activities are accessible adjacent to the river, including the [[Katoomba to Mittagong Trail]], the [[Six Foot Track]] and camping.\n\nVehicle access is available at many locations along the river. There are several areas close to [[Hartley, New South Wales|Hartley]]. As the river progresses towards [[Lake Burragorang]], vehicle access is not permitted. [[Bushwalking]] is the most popular access method to the Coxs River. There are several well maintained historic walks that follow along scenic sections of the river.

{"title_page": "Henry Van Asselt", "text_new": "[[File:Henry Van Asselt.jpeg|thumb|Henry Van Asselt, circa 1902]]\n'''Henry Van Asselt''' (11 April 1817, [[Elspeet]] - 7 December 1902, [[Seattle]]) was a [[Dutch people|Dutch]] immigrant to the US, one of the first to settle the area that is now [[Seattle, Washington]]. He came to the area in 1847 and was the longest surviving original settler of [[King County, Washington]], dying at age 85. He married late in life, in December, 1862, to Jane, the daughter of Jacob Maples, and they had four children.<ref name=\"seattlepi.com\"/>\n\n==Biography==\n\n===Early life===\nHe was born '''Hendrik van Asselt''' as the eldest child of Helmert van Asselt and Adriana Drost. At the age of 19, Van Asselt was drafted into the army, joining the Dutch Second Battalion of Yagers, and was stationed on the frontier between [[The Netherlands]]  and [[Belgium]]. He served a little over three years, until peace was consummated between the two countries. He then hunted on local noble estates and farmed with his parents up to 1847.\n\n===The Journey West===\nHe sailed for America on the bark Suelhyd, from [[Amsterdam]], and after a passage of forty-nine days landed in New York, on July 17, 1847. He went to [[New Jersey]] and worked nine months for $35, then proceeded from [[Albany, New York]] by canal to [[Buffalo, New York]], and thence by lakes and river to [[St. Louis, Missouri]] where he worked five months; then to [[Bloomington, Iowa]], where he remained until the spring of 1850, when he joined a party of eight, including James Thornton and Charles Hendricks, to cross the plains to California, paying $100 for his food and transportation.\n\nAt the fork of California and Oregon roads, they decided to go to Oregon, and arrived at [[Oregon City, Oregon|Oregon City]] on September 21. Near Oregon City he hired on with a farmer for two months at $75 per month, then began a new job making shingles, which he did until February, 1851, when he joined with Thornton, Hendricks and others and went to the gold mines of northern California.\n\nThey spent about five and a half weeks mining when the water gave out, so they divided their gold, giving each of them about $1,000. But supplies were costly, with flour selling at $1 per pound, and bacon $1.25, so he decided to return to the [[Willamette Valley]]. On the way the party of five fell in with L. M. Collins, who had a claim on the [[Nisqually River]], [[Washington Territory]], and was traveling with Jacob and Samuel Maple. Collins convinced Van Asselt, Thornton, and Hendricks to join them. They spent July 4, 1851, at Oregon City, then proceeded, by the [[Tualatin Plains]], to [[St. Helens, Oregon|St. Helens]].\n\nWhile crossing the river from that point Mr. Van Asselt accidentally shot himself in the shoulder and returned to St. Helens for treatment, where he remained for thirty days, then joined his friends on the Nisqually.\n\n===Settlement===\n[[File:Boeing Field Maple marker 02.jpg|thumb|Henry Van Asselt's name on a Boeing Field plaque]]\nWhile staying with Collins he explored the surrounding country for a place to settle, but did not find anything satisfactory, so he decided to return to the Willamette Valley with his friends.  Collins convinced him to look for farmland forty miles down the Sound, where the Indians were still numerous. Van Asselt and Samuel and Jacob Maples agreed to go with him, and on September 12, 1851, they started their journey by canoe to the [[Duwamish River]], then traveling upstream until they reached the junction of the [[White River (Washington)|White]] and [[Black River (Duwamish River)|Black]] rivers, where they found land and staked out claims. Van Asselt's claim is now part of [[Boeing Field]].

He came to the area in 1847 and was the longest surviving original settler of [[King County, Washington]], dying at age 85. He married late in life, in December, 1862, to Jane, the daughter of Jacob Maples, and they had four children.<ref name=\"seattlepi.com\"/>\n\n==Biography==\n\n===Early life===\nHe was born '''Hendrik van Asselt''' as the eldest child of Helmert van Asselt and Adriana Drost. At the age of 19, Van Asselt was drafted into the army, joining the Dutch Second Battalion of Yagers, and was stationed on the frontier between [[The Netherlands]]  and [[Belgium]]. He served a little over three years, until peace was consummated between the two countries. He then hunted on local noble estates and farmed with his parents up to 1847.\n\n===The Journey West===\nHe sailed for America on the bark Suelhyd, from [[Amsterdam]], and after a passage of forty-nine days landed in New York, on July 17, 1847. He went to [[New Jersey]] and worked nine months for $35, then proceeded from [[Albany, New York]] by canal to [[Buffalo, New York]], and thence by lakes and river to [[St. Louis, Missouri]] where he worked five months; then to [[Bloomington, Iowa]], where he remained until the spring of 1850, when he joined a party of eight, including James Thornton and Charles Hendricks, to cross the plains to California, paying $100 for his food and transportation.\n\nAt the fork of California and Oregon roads, they decided to go to Oregon, and arrived at [[Oregon City, Oregon|Oregon City]] on September 21. Near Oregon City he hired on with a farmer for two months at $75 per month, then began a new job making shingles, which he did until February, 1851, when he joined with Thornton, Hendricks and others and went to the gold mines of northern California.\n\nThey spent about five and a half weeks mining when the water gave out, so they divided their gold, giving each of them about $1,000. But supplies were costly, with flour selling at $1 per pound, and bacon $1.25, so he decided to return to the [[Willamette Valley]]. On the way the party of five fell in with L. M. Collins, who had a claim on the [[Nisqually River]], [[Washington Territory]], and was traveling with Jacob and Samuel Maple. Collins convinced Van Asselt, Thornton, and Hendricks to join them. They spent July 4, 1851, at Oregon City, then proceeded, by the [[Tualatin Plains]], to [[St. Helens, Oregon|St. Helens]].\n\nWhile crossing the river from that point Mr. Van Asselt accidentally shot himself in the shoulder and returned to St. Helens for treatment, where he remained for thirty days, then joined his friends on the Nisqually.\n\n===Settlement===\n[[File:Boeing Field Maple marker 02.jpg|thumb|Henry Van Asselt's name on a Boeing Field plaque]]\nWhile staying with Collins he explored the surrounding country for a place to settle, but did not find anything satisfactory, so he decided to return to the Willamette Valley with his friends.  Collins convinced him to look for farmland forty miles down the Sound, where the Indians were still numerous. Van Asselt and Samuel and Jacob Maples agreed to go with him, and on September 12, 1851, they started their journey by canoe to the [[Duwamish River]], then traveling upstream until they reached the junction of the [[White River (Washington)|White]] and [[Black River (Duwamish River)|Black]] rivers, where they found land and staked out claims. Van Asselt's claim is now part of [[Boeing Field]]. The site now occupied by Seattle was inhabited solely by Indians, and there were no settlers within the boundaries of what is now King County.<ref name=\"seattlepi.com\"/>\n\nReturning to the Nisqually, Collins sold his claim there, and with a scow purchased at [[Olympia, Washington]] the combined party moved their animals and effects to the new claims, where they built log cabins, becoming the first settlers in the Seattle area.

The word \"Malankara\" is a combination of two words, 'Mala' which means mountains and 'Kara' which means land surface; and refers to the modern-day state of [[Kerala]] in India. This land had a historical trade connection with the [[Middle East]] nations from the ancient era and the traders from [[Ancient Egypt|Egypt]], [[Sasanian Empire|Persia]], and the [[Levant]] frequently visited this land for getting [[Spice|spices]]. These groups included Arabs, Jews and also Christians, and the Christians who visited here maintained contact with the Malankara Church. As such the Church in Malankara was in touch with other Eastern churches such as the [[Coptic Orthodox Church of Alexandria|Coptic]] and [[Church of the East|Persian churches]]. The Malankara Church was headed by the 'Malankara Moopan' (also Malankara Metropolitan) who is the successor of Thomas the Apostle and also the heir of the Apostolic Throne of St Thomas in Malankara. \nThe Malankara Church was unique and unanimous till the 16th century and later some rifts happened due to the colonization of the [[Latin Church|Latin Catholic]] Portuguese [[padroado]] missionaries. A group of people split off from the church in 1663 under the leadership of [[Palliveettil Mar Chandy|Palliveettil Mar Chandy Kathanar]] who joined with the [[Roman Catholic Church|Church of Rome]]; this split caused to the emergence of the first [[Eastern Catholic Churches|Uniate Rite]] (modern-day [[Syro-Malabar Catholic Church|Syro-Malabar Church]]) in Malankara. Although in full communion with the Holy See of Rome, the Syro-Malabar Church employs the [[East Syriac Rite]] (Chaldean) liturgy of the Persian Church.  The people who stood with the Malankara Moopan remained independent as Malankara Nasranis. With the arrival of [[Gregorios Abdal Jaleel|Mar Gregorios Abdal Jaleel Bawa]] in 1665 from the [[Syriac Orthodox Church|Syriac Orthodox Church of Antioch]], he was able to re-establish ties between the Malankara Church and the Syriac Orthodox Church. And adopt over the [[Malankara Rite|Malankara Rite liturgy]] from the [[West Syriac Rite|West Syriac]] [[liturgical rite]] of the Syriac Orthodox Church. \n\nLater a number of splits happened in the Malankara Church due to the influence of foreign missionaries and internal conflicts. In the year 1772 a Syriac Orthodox bishop consecrated Kattumangatt Kurien (Mar Cyril) as his successor against the wishes of the Metropolitan, [[Mar Dionysius I]]; Cyril led a faction that eventually became the [[Malabar Independent Syrian Church]] (''Thozhiyur Church'').<ref name=Neill70>Neill 2002, p. 70.</ref><ref name=Vadakkekara92>Vadakkekara, p. 92.</ref> In the 19th century, a reform movement inspired by British [[Anglicanism|Anglican]] missionaries led to the formation of the independent [[Mar Thoma Syrian Church]], while the rest of the church, resistant to British influence, came under the direct jurisdiction of the Syriac Orthodox Patriarch in 1876.<ref name=Gregorios285/> In 1911, a dispute over authority between supporters of the Metropolitan and supporters of the Patriarch made a factional conflict in the Malankara Church and it made two factions in the church namely Bavakakshi, the people who support the Patriarch of Antioch and Methrankakshi, the people who support Malankara Metropolitan. This conflict led to a century lasting internal conflicts and litigation in the church. The Apex Court of India  passed  a remarkable judgement on Malankara Church dispute on 3rd July 2017 and this put an end to  all the internal conflicts\nin the Malankara Church. In 1930, under the leadership of [[Geevarghese Ivanios|Mar Geevarghese Ivanios]], a faction from the Malankara Church joined with the Catholic Church to form the [[Syro-Malankara Catholic Church|Malankara Catholic Church]], which employs the West Syriac liturgical rite of the Orthodox churches.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.cnewa.org/default.aspx?ID=66&pagetypeID=9&sitecode=hq&pageno=1 | title=The Syro-Malankara Catholic Church |publisher=E Catholic Near East Welfare Association  |first=Ronald|last= Roberson| access-date=2 August 2018 |url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n==Terminology==\nInitially the terms \"[[Malankara Christians]]\" or \"Malankara Nasranis\" were applied to all Saint Thomas Christians,<ref>Frykenberg, p. 109.</ref> but following the split the term was generally restricted to the faction loyal to [[Mar Thoma I]] the then Malankara Metropolitan, and distinguishing them from the Roman Catholic faction.<ref name=Frykenberg136>Frykenberg, p. 136.</ref> Later, many of the churches that subsequently branched off have maintained the word in their names. At the time of the split, the branch affiliated with Mar Thoma was called the ''Puttankuttukar'', or \"New Party\", while the branch that entered into Catholic obedience was designated the ''Pazhayakuttukar'', or \"Old Party\". The Portuguese Roman Catholics were not in familiar with the traditions of Eastern Christianity . In the view of Portuguese Missioneries the Nasranis who practice the Rituals of Eastern Christianity are new traditionals and there for they called the Malankara Nazranis ''Puttankuttukar'', or \"New Party\" and they called themselves as ''Pazhayakuttukar'', or \"Old Party\".  Following the association with the [[Syriac Orthodox Church]], the church was often known as the Malankara Syrian Church (Malayalam: \u0d2e\u0d32\u0d19\u0d4d\u0d15\u0d30 \u0d38\u0d41\u0d31\u0d3f\u0d2f\u0d3e\u0d28\u0d3f \u0d38\u0d2d) in reference to their connection to the [[West Syriac Rite|West Syriac tradition]].\n\n==Early history of Christianity in India==\n[[File:SaintThomasChristian'sDivisionsHistoryFinal-en.svg|alt=|thumb|265x265px|Saint Thomas Christians - Divisions- History in a nutshell]]\nAs a Saint Thomas Christian group, the Malankara Church traced its origins to [[Thomas the Apostle]], said to have proselytized in India in the 1st century.<ref name=Gregorios285/> Different strains of the tradition have him arriving either by sea<ref name=\"T.K.

From the early 4th century the [[Patriarch of the Church of the East]] provided India with clergy, holy texts, and ecclesiastical infrastructure, and around 650 Patriarch [[Ishoyahb III]] solidified the Church of the East's jurisdiction over the Saint Thomas Christian community.<ref>Baum & Winkler, p. 53.</ref> In the 8th century Patriarch [[Timothy I (Nestorian Patriarch)|Timothy I]] organised the community as the [[India (East Syrian Ecclesiastical Province)|Ecclesiastical Province of India]], one of the church's illustrious Provinces of the Exterior. After this point the Province of India was headed by a [[metropolitan bishop]], provided from Persia, the \"Metropolitan-Bishop of the Seat of Saint Thomas and the Whole Christian Church of India\".<ref name=Baum52/> His [[metropolitan see]] was probably in [[Cranganore]], or (perhaps nominally) in [[Mylapore]], where the shrine of Thomas was located.<ref name=Baum52/> Under him were a varying number of [[bishops]], as well as a native [[Archdeacon]], who had authority over the clergy and who wielded a great amount of secular power.<ref name=Baum52/>\n\n===Cheppeds: Collection of deeds on copper plates===\nThe Rulers of [[Kerala]], in appreciation for their assistance, gave to the Malankara Nazranis, three deeds on copper plates.

Though technically subordinate to the metropolitan, the archdeacon wielded great ecclesiastical and secular power, to the extent that he was considered the secular leader of the community and served as effective head of the Indian Church in times when the province was absent a bishop. Unlike the metropolitan, who was evidently always an East Syriac sent by the patriarch, the archdeacon was a native Saint Thomas Christian. In the documented period the position was evidently hereditary, belonging to the [[Pakalomattam]] family, who claimed a privileged connection to Thomas the Apostle.<ref name=Baum52/><ref>Vadakkekara, pp. 271\u2013272.</ref>\n\nDetails on the archidiaconate prior to the arrival of the Portuguese are elusive, but Patriarch [[Timothy I (Nestorian Patriarch)|Timothy I]] (780 \u2013 823) called the Archdeacon of India the \"head of the faithful in India\", implying an elevated status by at least that time.<ref>Vadakkekara, pp. 271.</ref> In the recorded period of its history, the office of archdeacon was substantially different in India than in the rest of the Church of the East or other Christian churches. In the broader Church of the East, each bishop was attended by an archdeacon, but in India, there was only ever one archdeacon, even when the province had multiple bishops serving it.<ref>Vadakkekara, p. 272.</ref>\n\nFollowing the collapse of the Church of the East's hierarchy in most of Asia in the 14th century, India was effectively cut off from the church's heartland in Mesopotamia and formal contact was severed. By the late 15th century India had had no metropolitan for several generations, and the authority traditionally associated with him had been vested in the archdeacon.<ref name=\"Baum105\">Baum & Winkler, p. 105.</ref> In 1491 the archdeacon sent envoys to the Patriarch of the Church of the East, as well as to the [[Coptic Orthodox Church of Alexandria|Coptic]] [[Pope of Alexandria]] and to the [[Syriac Orthodox Patriarch of Antioch]], requesting a new bishop for India. The Patriarch of the Church of the East [[Shem'on IV Basidi|Shem\u02bfon IV Basidi]] responded by consecrating two bishops, Thoma and Yuhanon, and dispatching them to India.<ref name=Baum105/> These bishops helped rebuild the ecclesiastical infrastructure and reestablish fraternal ties with the patriarchate, but the years of separation had greatly affected the structure of the Indian church. Though receiving utmost respect, the metropolitan was treated as a guest in his own diocese; the Archdeacon was firmly established as the real power in the Malankara community.<ref>Vadakkekara, p. 274.</ref>\n\n==Arrival of the Portuguese==\n{{See also|Portuguese India}}\nAt the time the [[Portugal|Portuguese]] arrived in India in 1498, the Saint Thomas Christians were in a difficult position. Though prosperous owing to their large stake in the [[spice trade]] and protected by a formidable militia, the tumultuous political climate of the time had placed the small community under pressure from the forces of the powerful [[raja]]s of [[Kozhikode|Calicut]], [[Kingdom of Cochin|Cochin]], and the various smaller kingdoms in the area. When the Portuguese under [[Vasco da Gama]] arrived on the South Indian coast, the leaders of the Saint Thomas community greeted them and proffered a formal alliance to their fellow Christians.<ref>Frykenberg, pp. 122\u2013124.</ref> The Portuguese, who had keen interest in implanting themselves in the spice trade and in expanding the domain of their bellicose form of Christianity, jumped at this opportunity.<ref>Frykenberg, pp. 125\u2013127.</ref>\n\nThe Portuguese brought to India a particularly militant brand of Christianity, the product of several centuries of struggle during the [[Reconquista]], which they hoped to spread across the world.<ref>Frykenberg, p. 127.</ref> Facilitating this objective was the ''[[Padroado Real]]'', a series of treaties and decrees in which the [[Pope]] conferred upon the Portuguese government certain authority in ecclesiastical matters in the foreign territories they conquered.<ref>Frykenberg, pp. 127\u2013128.</ref> Upon reaching India the Portuguese quickly ensconced themselves in [[Goa]] and established a church hierarchy; soon they set themselves to bringing the native Christians under their dominion. Towards this goal, the colonial establishment felt it necessary to conduct the Saint Thomas Christians fully into the [[Latin Rite]], both in bringing them into conformity with Latin church customs and in subjecting them to the authority of the [[Archbishop of Goa]].\n\nFollowing the death of Metropolitan Mar Jacob in 1552, the Portuguese became more aggressive in their efforts to subjugate the Saint Thomas Christians.<ref>Frykenberg, p. 130.</ref> Protests on the part of the natives were frustrated by events back in the Church of the East's Mesopotamian heartland, which left them devoid of consistent leadership. In 1552, the year of Jacob's death, a [[Schism of 1552|schism in the Church of the East]] resulted in there being two rival patriarchates, one of which entered into communion with the [[Catholic Church]], and the other of which remained independent. At different times both patriarchs sent bishops to India, but the Portuguese were consistently able to outmaneuver the newcomers or else convert them to Latin Rite Catholicism outright.<ref>Frykenberg, pp. 130\u2013133.</ref> In 1575 the Padroado declared that neither patriarch could appoint prelates to the community without Portuguese consent, thereby cutting the Thomas Christians off from their hierarchy.<ref>Frykenberg, p. 134.</ref>\n\nBy 1599 the last Metropolitan, Abraham, had died, and the Archbishop of Goa, [[Aleixo de Menezes]], had secured the submission of the young Archdeacon George, the highest remaining representative of the native church hierarchy.<ref>Neill 2004, pp. 208\u2013210.</ref> That year Menezes convened the [[Synod of Diamper]], which instituted a number of structural and liturgical reforms to the Indian church. At the synod, the parishes were brought directly under the Archbishop's authority, certain \"superstitious\" customs were anathematized, and the traditional variant of the [[East Syriac Rite]], was purged of elements unacceptable by the Latin standards.<ref>Neill 2004, p. 214.</ref> Though the Saint Thomas Christians were now formally part of the Catholic Church, the conduct of the Portuguese over the next decades fueled resentment in parts of the community, ultimately leading to open resistance.<ref name=\"Frykenberg136\"/>\n\n==Coonan Cross and the independent church==\n{{See also|Coonan Cross Oath}}\nOver the next several decades, tensions seethed between the Latin prelates and what remained of the native hierarchy. This came to a head in 1641 with the ascension of two new protagonists on either side of the contention: Francis Garcia, the new Archbishop of Kodungalloor, and Archdeacon [[Mar Thoma I|Thomas]], the nephew and successor to Archdeacon George.<ref name=\"Frykenberg367\">Frykenberg, p. 367.</ref> In 1652, the escalating situation was further complicated by the arrival in India of a mysterious figure named [[Ahatallah]].<ref name=Frykenberg367/><ref>Neill 2004, p. 316.</ref>\n\nAhatallah arrived in [[Mylapore]] in 1652, claiming to be the rightful [[Patriarch of Antioch]] who had been sent by the Catholic pope to serve as \"Patriarch of the Whole of India and of China\".<ref name=\"Neill317\">Neill 2004, p. 317.</ref> Ahatallah's true biography is obscure, but some details have been established. He appears to have been a [[Syriac Orthodox]] Bishop of Damascus who converted to Catholicism and went to Rome in 1632. He then returned to Syria in order to bring the Syriac Orthodox Patriarch [[Ignatius Hidayat Allah]] into communion with Rome. He had not accomplished this by the time Hidayat Allah died in 1639, after which point Ahatallah began claiming he was Hidayat Allah's rightful successor. In 1646 he was in [[Egypt]] at the court of the [[Coptic Pope]] [[Pope Mark VI of Alexandria|Mark VI]], who dispatched him to India in 1652, evidently in response to a request for aid from Archdeacon Thomas. Reckoning him an impostor, the Portuguese arrested him, but allowed him to meet with members of the Saint Thomas Christian clergy, whom he impressed greatly. The Portuguese put him on a ship bound for Cochin and Goa, and Archdeacon Thomas led his militia to Cochin demanding to meet with the Patriarch. The Portuguese refused, asserting that he was a dangerous invader and that the ship had already sailed on to Goa.<ref name=Neill317/>\n\nAhatallah was never heard from again in India, and rumours soon spread that Archbishop Garcia had disposed of him before he ever reached Goa.<ref name=\"Neill319\">Neill 2004, p. 319.</ref> Contemporary accounts allege that he was drowned in Cochin harbour, or even that the Portuguese burned him at the stake.<ref name=Neill319/><ref>Frykenberg, p. 368.</ref> In reality, it appears that Ahatallah did in fact reach Goa, from whence he was sent on to Europe, but he evidently died in [[Paris]] before reaching Rome where his case was to be heard.<ref name=Neill319/> In any event, Garcia's dismissiveness towards the Saint Thomas Christians' appeals only embittered the community further.<ref name=Neill319/>\n\nThis was the last straw for the Saint Thomas Christians, and in 1653 Thomas and representatives of the community met at the Church of Our Lady in [[Mattancherry]] to take bold action. In a great ceremony before a crucifix and lighted candles, they swore a solemn oath that they would never obey Garcia or the Portuguese again, and that they accepted only the Archdeacon as their shepherd.<ref name=Neill319/> The Malankara Church and all its successor churches regard this declaration, known as the [[Coonan Cross Oath]] (Malayalam: ''\u0d15\u0d42\u0d28\u0d7b \u0d15\u0d41\u0d30\u0d3f\u0d36\u0d41 \u0d38\u0d24\u0d4d\u0d2f\u0d02''), after the outdoor cross in the churchyard, as the moment when their church regained its independence.<ref name=Neill319/>\n\n==Later development==\n[[File:Raja Ravi Varma, Gheevarghese Mar Gregorios of Parumala (1905).jpg|thumbnail|right|360px|The first saint of India Malankara church [[Gheevarghese Mar Gregorios of Parumala]] ]]\n[[File:Mar Thoma III.jpg|thumb|360px|[[Mar Thoma III]], 3rd Malankara Metropolitan]]\n\nThe oppressive rule of the Portuguese padroado provoked a violent reaction on the part of the indigenous Christian community.  The first solemn protest took place in 1653, known as the Coonan Kurishu Satyam ([[Coonan Cross Oath]]). Under the leadership of Archdeacon Thoma, the [[St. Thomas Christians]] publicly took an oath in [[Mattancherry]], Cochin, that they would not obey the Portuguese Catholic bishops and the [[Jesuit]] missionaries. Until the Portuguese arrival, Malankara Christians never even heard of the [[Roman Catholic Pope]]. Unfortunately there was no Metropolitan present in the Malankara Church at that time. Hence in the same year, at Alangad, Archdeacon Thoma was ordained, by the laying on of hands of twelve priests, as the first known indigenous Metropolitan of Kerala, under the name [[Mar Thoma I]]. The Portuguese missionaries attempted for reconciliation with Saint Thomas Christians but was not successful. Later Pope Alexander VII sent the Syrian bishop Joseph Sebastiani at the head of a Carmelite delegation who succeeded in convincing majority of Saint Thomas Christians, including [[Parambil Mar Chandy|Palliveettil Chandy Kathanar]] and Kadavil Chandy Kathanar.Episcopal consecration of [[Mar Thoma I]] as a Bishop was regularized in the year 1665 by Mar [[Gregorios Abdal Jaleel]].Later Palliveettil Chandy Kathanar was consecrated as the bishop for the Syriac Catholics This led to the first permanent split in the Saint Thomas Christian community. Thereafter, the faction affiliated with the Catholic Church under Parambil Mar Chandy was designated the ''Pazhayakoottukar'', or \"Old Party\", while the branch affiliated with Mar Thoma was called the ''Puthankoottukar'', or \"New Party\".<ref name=\"Vadakkekara86\" /><ref name=\"Frykenberg, p. 361\"/><ref name=\"Fernando, p. 79\"/><ref name=\"Chaput, pp. 7\u20138\"/> These appellations have been somewhat controversial, as both groups considered themselves the true heirs to the Saint Thomas tradition, and saw the other as heretical.<ref name=\"Vadakkekara, p. 84 and note\"/>\n\n[[Mar Thoma I]] with 44 churches(out of 69 total churches)and their congregations were the body from which the [[Malankara Syrian Church]]es ([[Malankara Orthodox Syrian Church]], [[Jacobite Syrian Christian Church]], [[Mar Thoma Syrian Church]], [[Syro-Malankara Catholic Church]] and [[Malabar Independent Syrian Church]] originated. The Catholic faction constantly challenged the legitimacy of the consecration of Archdeacon as Metropolitan .This made it essential to rectify the illegitimacy of the consecration of Archdeacon as Metropolitan. In 1665, [[Mar Gregorios Abdul Jaleel]], a Bishop sent by the Syriac Orthodox Patriarch of Antioch arrived in India and the Saint Thomas Christians under the leadership of the Archdeacon welcomed him.<ref name=\"Geddes\">Claudius Buchanan 1811 ., Menachery G; 1973, 1982, 1998; Podipara, Placid J. 1970; Leslie Brown, 1956; Tisserant, E. 1957; [[Michael Geddes]], 1694;</ref><ref name=\"ReferenceA\">Dr. Thekkedath, History of Christianity in India\"</ref> [[Gregorios Abdal Jaleel]] regularised the consecration of Archdeacon as Metropolitan as per the apostolic standards of Kaiveppu (traditional legitimate way of laying hands by a valid Bishop). This resulted in the spiritual relationship the Syriac Orthodox Patriarch and the reaffirmation of the orthodox faith in the Church. The 18th century saw the gradual introduction of West Syriac liturgy and script to the Malabar Coast, a process that continued through the 19th century.\n\nThe arrival of Mar Gregorios in 1665, marked the introduction of [[Oriental Orthodoxy]] in the Malankara Church.\n\nIn 1912, a Catholicate was instituted in Malankara by the Syriac orthodox Patriarch [[Ignatius Abdul Masih II|Abdul Masih]], thereby starting a century of legal proceedings between factions of the church which supported the Catholicate, and those who opposed it on behalf of the claims that, the [[Ignatius Abdul Masih II|Abdul Masih]] was excommunicated.\n\nThe Malankara Church experienced a series of splits over the centuries, resulting in the formation of several churches, some of which embraced the jurisdiction of foreign churches, while others remained autocephalous and autonomous churches.\n\nThe churches that share the Malankara Church tradition are:\n#[[Malankara Orthodox Syrian Church]]: an autonomous and autocephalous oriental orthodox church.<ref>http://www.cnewa.org/default.aspx?ID=9&pagetypeID=9&sitecode=hq&pageno=1</ref> Catholicos of the East and [[Malankara Metropolitan]] entroned on the apostolic throne of [[Thomas the Apostle|Saint Thomas]] is the primate of the church.\n#[[Jacobite Syrian Christian Church]]: an autonomous oriental orthodox church under the jurisdiction of the [[Syriac Orthodox Patriarch of Antioch]].\n#[[Malankara Mar Thoma Syrian Church]]: an Independent and autonomous Malankara church under the jurisdiction of Marthoma Metropolitan\n#[[Syro-Malankara Catholic Church]]: a [[Sui iuris|self-governing]] [[Eastern Catholic]] church within the [[Catholic Church|Catholic]] communion.\n#[[Malabar Independent Syrian Church]]: an autonomous and autocephalous church under the jurisdiction of its own independent Metropolitan.\n\n==See also==\n<!---only for articles not mentioned above--->\n*'''Pazhaya Seminary''' [[Orthodox Theological Seminary, Kottayam]]\n* [[Malankara Metropolitan]]\n* [[List of Malankara Metropolitans]]\n\n==Footnotes==\n{{notelist}}\n\n==Notes==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==References==\n* {{Cite book|ref=harv|last1=Baum|first1=Wilhelm|authorlink1=Wilhelm Baum|last2=Winkler|first2=Dietmar W.|title=The Church of the East: A Concise History|year=2003|location=London-New York|publisher=Routledge-Curzon|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=CnSCAgAAQBAJ}}\n* {{Cite journal |last1= Chaput|first1= Pascale|year= 1999 |title= La Double identit\u00e9 des chr\u00e9tiens keralais : confessions et castes chr\u00e9tiennes au Kerala (Inde du Sud) / The Double Identity of Kerala Christians: Confessions and Christian Castes (South India)|journal= Archives des sciences sociales des religions|publisher= |volume= 106|issue= |pages= 5\u201323|url= http://www.persee.fr/web/revues/home/prescript/article/assr_0335-5985_1999_num_106_1_1084#|doi= }}\n* Fernando, Leonard; Gispert-Sauch, G.

The word \"Malankara\" is a combination of two words, 'Mala' which means mountains and 'Kara' which means land surface; and refers to the modern-day state of [[Kerala]] in India. This land had a historical trade connection with the [[Middle East]] nations from the ancient era and the traders from [[Ancient Egypt|Egypt]], [[Sasanian Empire|Persia]], and the [[Levant]] frequently visited this land for getting [[Spice|spices]]. These groups included Arabs, Jews and also Christians, and the Christians who visited here maintained contact with the Malankara Church. As such the Church in Malankara was in touch with other Eastern churches such as the [[Coptic Orthodox Church of Alexandria|Coptic]] and [[Church of the East|Persian churches]]. The Malankara Church was headed by the 'Malankara Moopan' (also Malankara Metropolitan) who is the successor of Thomas the Apostle and also the heir of the Apostolic Throne of St Thomas in Malankara. \nThe Malankara Church was unique and unanimous till the 16th century and later some rifts happened due to the colonization of the [[Latin Church|Latin Catholic]] Portuguese [[padroado]] missionaries. A group of people split off from the church in 1663 under the leadership of [[Palliveettil Mar Chandy|Palliveettil Mar Chandy Kathanar]] who joined with the [[Roman Catholic Church|Church of Rome]]; this split caused to the emergence of the first [[Eastern Catholic Churches|Uniate Rite]] (modern-day [[Syro-Malabar Catholic Church|Syro-Malabar Church]]) in Malankara. Although in full communion with the Holy See of Rome, the Syro-Malabar Church employs the [[East Syriac Rite]] (Chaldean) liturgy of the Persian Church.  The people who stood with the Malankara Moopan remained independent as Malankara Nasranis. With the arrival of [[Gregorios Abdal Jaleel|Mar Gregorios Abdal Jaleel Bawa]] in 1665 from the [[Syriac Orthodox Church|Syriac Orthodox Church of Antioch]], he was able to re-establish ties between the Malankara Church and the Syriac Orthodox Church. And adopt over the [[Malankara Rite|Malankara Rite liturgy]] from the [[West Syriac Rite|West Syriac]] [[liturgical rite]] of the Syriac Orthodox Church. \n\nLater a number of splits happened in the Malankara Church due to the influence of foreign missionaries and internal conflicts. In the year 1772 a Syriac Orthodox bishop consecrated Kattumangatt Kurien (Mar Cyril) as his successor against the wishes of the Metropolitan, [[Mar Dionysius I]]; Cyril led a faction that eventually became the [[Malabar Independent Syrian Church]] (''Thozhiyur Church'').<ref name=Neill70>Neill 2002, p. 70.</ref><ref name=Vadakkekara92>Vadakkekara, p. 92.</ref> In the 19th century, a reform movement inspired by British [[Anglicanism|Anglican]] missionaries led to the formation of the independent [[Mar Thoma Syrian Church]], while the rest of the church, resistant to British influence, came under the direct jurisdiction of the Syriac Orthodox Patriarch in 1876.<ref name=Gregorios285/> In 1911, a dispute over authority between supporters of the Metropolitan and supporters of the Patriarch made a factional conflict in the Malankara Church and it made two factions in the church namely Bavakakshi, the people who support the Patriarch of Antioch and Methrankakshi, the people who support Malankara Metropolitan. This conflict led to a century lasting internal conflicts and litigation in the church. The Apex Court of India  passed  a remarkable judgement on Malankara Church dispute on 3rd July 2017 and this put an end to  all the internal conflicts\nin the Malankara Church. In 1930, under the leadership of [[Geevarghese Ivanios|Mar Geevarghese Ivanios]], a faction from the Malankara Church joined with the Catholic Church to form the [[Syro-Malankara Catholic Church|Malankara Catholic Church]], which employs the West Syriac liturgical rite of the Orthodox churches.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.cnewa.org/default.aspx?ID=66&pagetypeID=9&sitecode=hq&pageno=1 | title=The Syro-Malankara Catholic Church |publisher=E Catholic Near East Welfare Association  |first=Ronald|last= Roberson| access-date=2 August 2018 |url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n==Terminology==\nInitially the terms \"[[Malankara Christians]]\" or \"Malankara Nasranis\" were applied to all Saint Thomas Christians,<ref>Frykenberg, p. 109.</ref> but following the split the term was generally restricted to the faction loyal to [[Mar Thoma I]] the then Malankara Metropolitan, and distinguishing them from the Roman Catholic faction.<ref name=Frykenberg136>Frykenberg, p. 136.</ref> Later, many of the churches that subsequently branched off have maintained the word in their names.

In the view of Portuguese Missioneries the Nasranis who practice the Rituals of Eastern Christianity are new traditionals and there for they called the Malankara Nazranis ''Puttankuttukar'', or \"New Party\" and they called themselves as ''Pazhayakuttukar'', or \"Old Party\".

From the early 4th century the [[Patriarch of the Church of the East]] provided India with clergy, holy texts, and ecclesiastical infrastructure, and around 650 Patriarch [[Ishoyahb III]] solidified the Church of the East's jurisdiction over the Saint Thomas Christian community.<ref>Baum & Winkler, p. 53.</ref> In the 8th century Patriarch [[Timothy I (Nestorian Patriarch)|Timothy I]] organised the community as the [[India (East Syrian Ecclesiastical Province)|Ecclesiastical Province of India]], one of the church's illustrious Provinces of the Exterior. After this point the Province of India was headed by a [[metropolitan bishop]], provided from Persia, the \"Metropolitan-Bishop of the Seat of Saint Thomas and the Whole Christian Church of India\".<ref name=Baum52/> His [[metropolitan see]] was probably in [[Cranganore]], or (perhaps nominally) in [[Mylapore]], where the shrine of Thomas was located.<ref name=Baum52/> Under him were a varying number of [[bishops]], as well as a native [[Archdeacon]], who had authority over the clergy and who wielded a great amount of secular power.<ref name=Baum52/>\n\n===Cheppeds: Collection of deeds on copper plates===\nThe Rulers of [[Kerala]], in appreciation for their assistance, gave to the Malankara Nazranis, three deeds on copper plates.

Though technically subordinate to the metropolitan, the archdeacon wielded great ecclesiastical and secular power, to the extent that he was considered the secular leader of the community and served as effective head of the Indian Church in times when the province was absent a bishop. Unlike the metropolitan, who was evidently always an East Syriac sent by the patriarch, the archdeacon was a native Saint Thomas Christian. In the documented period the position was evidently hereditary, belonging to the [[Pakalomattam]] family, who claimed a privileged connection to Thomas the Apostle.<ref name=Baum52/><ref>Vadakkekara, pp. 271\u2013272.</ref>\n\nDetails on the archidiaconate prior to the arrival of the Portuguese are elusive, but Patriarch [[Timothy I (Nestorian Patriarch)|Timothy I]] (780 \u2013 823) called the Archdeacon of India the \"head of the faithful in India\", implying an elevated status by at least that time.<ref>Vadakkekara, pp. 271.</ref> In the recorded period of its history, the office of archdeacon was substantially different in India than in the rest of the Church of the East or other Christian churches. In the broader Church of the East, each bishop was attended by an archdeacon, but in India, there was only ever one archdeacon, even when the province had multiple bishops serving it.<ref>Vadakkekara, p. 272.</ref>\n\nFollowing the collapse of the Church of the East's hierarchy in most of Asia in the 14th century, India was effectively cut off from the church's heartland in Mesopotamia and formal contact was severed. By the late 15th century India had had no metropolitan for several generations, and the authority traditionally associated with him had been vested in the archdeacon.<ref name=\"Baum105\">Baum & Winkler, p. 105.</ref> In 1491 the archdeacon sent envoys to the Patriarch of the Church of the East, as well as to the [[Coptic Orthodox Church of Alexandria|Coptic]] [[Pope of Alexandria]] and to the [[Syriac Orthodox Patriarch of Antioch]], requesting a new bishop for India. The Patriarch of the Church of the East [[Shem'on IV Basidi|Shem\u02bfon IV Basidi]] responded by consecrating two bishops, Thoma and Yuhanon, and dispatching them to India.<ref name=Baum105/> These bishops helped rebuild the ecclesiastical infrastructure and reestablish fraternal ties with the patriarchate, but the years of separation had greatly affected the structure of the Indian church. Though receiving utmost respect, the metropolitan was treated as a guest in his own diocese; the Archdeacon was firmly established as the real power in the Malankara community.<ref>Vadakkekara, p. 274.</ref>\n\n==Arrival of the Portuguese==\n{{See also|Portuguese India}}\nAt the time the [[Portugal|Portuguese]] arrived in India in 1498, the Saint Thomas Christians were in a difficult position. Though prosperous owing to their large stake in the [[spice trade]] and protected by a formidable militia, the tumultuous political climate of the time had placed the small community under pressure from the forces of the powerful [[raja]]s of [[Kozhikode|Calicut]], [[Kingdom of Cochin|Cochin]], and the various smaller kingdoms in the area. When the Portuguese under [[Vasco da Gama]] arrived on the South Indian coast, the leaders of the Saint Thomas community greeted them and proffered a formal alliance to their fellow Christians.<ref>Frykenberg, pp. 122\u2013124.</ref> The Portuguese, who had keen interest in implanting themselves in the spice trade and in expanding the domain of their bellicose form of Christianity, jumped at this opportunity.<ref>Frykenberg, pp. 125\u2013127.</ref>\n\nThe Portuguese brought to India a particularly militant brand of Christianity, the product of several centuries of struggle during the [[Reconquista]], which they hoped to spread across the world.<ref>Frykenberg, p. 127.</ref> Facilitating this objective was the ''[[Padroado Real]]'', a series of treaties and decrees in which the [[Pope]] conferred upon the Portuguese government certain authority in ecclesiastical matters in the foreign territories they conquered.<ref>Frykenberg, pp. 127\u2013128.</ref> Upon reaching India the Portuguese quickly ensconced themselves in [[Goa]] and established a church hierarchy; soon they set themselves to bringing the native Christians under their dominion. Towards this goal, the colonial establishment felt it necessary to conduct the Saint Thomas Christians fully into the [[Latin Rite]], both in bringing them into conformity with Latin church customs and in subjecting them to the authority of the [[Archbishop of Goa]].\n\nFollowing the death of Metropolitan Mar Jacob in 1552, the Portuguese became more aggressive in their efforts to subjugate the Saint Thomas Christians.<ref>Frykenberg, p. 130.</ref> Protests on the part of the natives were frustrated by events back in the Church of the East's Mesopotamian heartland, which left them devoid of consistent leadership. In 1552, the year of Jacob's death, a [[Schism of 1552|schism in the Church of the East]] resulted in there being two rival patriarchates, one of which entered into communion with the [[Catholic Church]], and the other of which remained independent. At different times both patriarchs sent bishops to India, but the Portuguese were consistently able to outmaneuver the newcomers or else convert them to Latin Rite Catholicism outright.<ref>Frykenberg, pp. 130\u2013133.</ref> In 1575 the Padroado declared that neither patriarch could appoint prelates to the community without Portuguese consent, thereby cutting the Thomas Christians off from their hierarchy.<ref>Frykenberg, p. 134.</ref>\n\nBy 1599 the last Metropolitan, Abraham, had died, and the Archbishop of Goa, [[Aleixo de Menezes]], had secured the submission of the young Archdeacon George, the highest remaining representative of the native church hierarchy.<ref>Neill 2004, pp. 208\u2013210.</ref> That year Menezes convened the [[Synod of Diamper]], which instituted a number of structural and liturgical reforms to the Indian church. At the synod, the parishes were brought directly under the Archbishop's authority, certain \"superstitious\" customs were anathematized, and the traditional variant of the [[East Syriac Rite]], was purged of elements unacceptable by the Latin standards.<ref>Neill 2004, p. 214.</ref> Though the Saint Thomas Christians were now formally part of the Catholic Church, the conduct of the Portuguese over the next decades fueled resentment in parts of the community, ultimately leading to open resistance.<ref name=\"Frykenberg136\"/>\n\n==Coonan Cross and the independent church==\n{{See also|Coonan Cross Oath}}\nOver the next several decades, tensions seethed between the Latin prelates and what remained of the native hierarchy. This came to a head in 1641 with the ascension of two new protagonists on either side of the contention: Francis Garcia, the new Archbishop of Kodungalloor, and Archdeacon [[Mar Thoma I|Thomas]], the nephew and successor to Archdeacon George.<ref name=\"Frykenberg367\">Frykenberg, p. 367.</ref> In 1652, the escalating situation was further complicated by the arrival in India of a mysterious figure named [[Ahatallah]].<ref name=Frykenberg367/><ref>Neill 2004, p. 316.</ref>\n\nAhatallah arrived in [[Mylapore]] in 1652, claiming to be the rightful [[Patriarch of Antioch]] who had been sent by the Catholic pope to serve as \"Patriarch of the Whole of India and of China\".<ref name=\"Neill317\">Neill 2004, p. 317.</ref> Ahatallah's true biography is obscure, but some details have been established. He appears to have been a [[Syriac Orthodox]] Bishop of Damascus who converted to Catholicism and went to Rome in 1632. He then returned to Syria in order to bring the Syriac Orthodox Patriarch [[Ignatius Hidayat Allah]] into communion with Rome. He had not accomplished this by the time Hidayat Allah died in 1639, after which point Ahatallah began claiming he was Hidayat Allah's rightful successor. In 1646 he was in [[Egypt]] at the court of the [[Coptic Pope]] [[Pope Mark VI of Alexandria|Mark VI]], who dispatched him to India in 1652, evidently in response to a request for aid from Archdeacon Thomas. Reckoning him an impostor, the Portuguese arrested him, but allowed him to meet with members of the Saint Thomas Christian clergy, whom he impressed greatly. The Portuguese put him on a ship bound for Cochin and Goa, and Archdeacon Thomas led his militia to Cochin demanding to meet with the Patriarch. The Portuguese refused, asserting that he was a dangerous invader and that the ship had already sailed on to Goa.<ref name=Neill317/>\n\nAhatallah was never heard from again in India, and rumours soon spread that Archbishop Garcia had disposed of him before he ever reached Goa.<ref name=\"Neill319\">Neill 2004, p. 319.</ref> Contemporary accounts allege that he was drowned in Cochin harbour, or even that the Portuguese burned him at the stake.<ref name=Neill319/><ref>Frykenberg, p. 368.</ref> In reality, it appears that Ahatallah did in fact reach Goa, from whence he was sent on to Europe, but he evidently died in [[Paris]] before reaching Rome where his case was to be heard.<ref name=Neill319/> In any event, Garcia's dismissiveness towards the Saint Thomas Christians' appeals only embittered the community further.<ref name=Neill319/>\n\nThis was the last straw for the Saint Thomas Christians, and in 1653 Thomas and representatives of the community met at the Church of Our Lady in [[Mattancherry]] to take bold action. In a great ceremony before a crucifix and lighted candles, they swore a solemn oath that they would never obey Garcia or the Portuguese again, and that they accepted only the Archdeacon as their shepherd.<ref name=Neill319/> The Malankara Church and all its successor churches regard this declaration, known as the [[Coonan Cross Oath]] (Malayalam: ''\u0d15\u0d42\u0d28\u0d7b \u0d15\u0d41\u0d30\u0d3f\u0d36\u0d41 \u0d38\u0d24\u0d4d\u0d2f\u0d02''), after the outdoor cross in the churchyard, as the moment when their church regained its independence.<ref name=Neill319/>\n\n==Later development==\n[[File:Raja Ravi Varma, Gheevarghese Mar Gregorios of Parumala (1905).jpg|thumbnail|right|360px|The first saint of India Malankara church [[Gheevarghese Mar Gregorios of Parumala]] ]]\n[[File:Mar Thoma III.jpg|thumb|360px|[[Mar Thoma III]], 3rd Malankara Metropolitan]]\n\nThe oppressive rule of the Portuguese padroado provoked a violent reaction on the part of the indigenous Christian community.  The first solemn protest took place in 1653, known as the Coonan Kurishu Satyam ([[Coonan Cross Oath]]). Under the leadership of Archdeacon Thoma, the [[St. Thomas Christians]] publicly took an oath in [[Mattancherry]], Cochin, that they would not obey the Portuguese Catholic bishops and the [[Jesuit]] missionaries. Until the Portuguese arrival, Malankara Christians never even heard of the [[Roman Catholic Pope]]. Unfortunately there was no Metropolitan present in the Malankara Church at that time. Hence in the same year, at Alangad, Archdeacon Thoma was ordained, by the laying on of hands of twelve priests, as the first known indigenous Metropolitan of Kerala, under the name [[Mar Thoma I]]. The Portuguese missionaries attempted for reconciliation with Saint Thomas Christians but was not successful. Later Pope Alexander VII sent the Syrian bishop Joseph Sebastiani at the head of a Carmelite delegation who succeeded in convincing majority of Saint Thomas Christians, including [[Parambil Mar Chandy|Palliveettil Chandy Kathanar]] and Kadavil Chandy Kathanar.Episcopal consecration of [[Mar Thoma I]] as a Bishop was regularized in the year 1665 by Mar [[Gregorios Abdal Jaleel]].Later Palliveettil Chandy Kathanar was consecrated as the bishop for the Syriac Catholics This led to the first permanent split in the Saint Thomas Christian community. Thereafter, the faction affiliated with the Catholic Church under Parambil Mar Chandy was designated the ''Pazhayakoottukar'', or \"Old Party\", while the branch affiliated with Mar Thoma was called the ''Puthankoottukar'', or \"New Party\".<ref name=\"Vadakkekara86\" /><ref name=\"Frykenberg, p. 361\"/><ref name=\"Fernando, p. 79\"/><ref name=\"Chaput, pp. 7\u20138\"/> These appellations have been somewhat controversial, as both groups considered themselves the true heirs to the Saint Thomas tradition, and saw the other as heretical.<ref name=\"Vadakkekara, p. 84 and note\"/>\n\n[[Mar Thoma I]] with 44 churches(out of 69 total churches)and their congregations were the body from which the [[Malankara Syrian Church]]es ([[Malankara Orthodox Syrian Church]], [[Jacobite Syrian Christian Church]], [[Mar Thoma Syrian Church]], [[Syro-Malankara Catholic Church]] and [[Malabar Independent Syrian Church]] originated. The Catholic faction constantly challenged the legitimacy of the consecration of Archdeacon as Metropolitan .This made it essential to rectify the illegitimacy of the consecration of Archdeacon as Metropolitan. In 1665, [[Mar Gregorios Abdul Jaleel]], a Bishop sent by the Syriac Orthodox Patriarch of Antioch arrived in India and the Saint Thomas Christians under the leadership of the Archdeacon welcomed him.<ref name=\"Geddes\">Claudius Buchanan 1811 ., Menachery G; 1973, 1982, 1998; Podipara, Placid J. 1970; Leslie Brown, 1956; Tisserant, E. 1957; [[Michael Geddes]], 1694;</ref><ref name=\"ReferenceA\">Dr. Thekkedath, History of Christianity in India\"</ref> [[Gregorios Abdal Jaleel]] regularised the consecration of Archdeacon as Metropolitan as per the apostolic standards of Kaiveppu (traditional legitimate way of laying hands by a valid Bishop). This resulted in the spiritual relationship the Syriac Orthodox Patriarch and the reaffirmation of the orthodox faith in the Church. The 18th century saw the gradual introduction of West Syriac liturgy and script to the Malabar Coast, a process that continued through the 19th century.\n\nThe arrival of Mar Gregorios in 1665, marked the introduction of [[Oriental Orthodoxy]] in the Malankara Church.\n\nIn 1912, a Catholicate was instituted in Malankara by the Syriac orthodox Patriarch [[Ignatius Abdul Masih II|Abdul Masih]], thereby starting a century of legal proceedings between factions of the church which supported the Catholicate, and those who opposed it on behalf of the claims that, the [[Ignatius Abdul Masih II|Abdul Masih]] was excommunicated.\n\nThe Malankara Church experienced a series of splits over the centuries, resulting in the formation of several churches, some of which embraced the jurisdiction of foreign churches, while others remained autocephalous and autonomous churches.\n\nThe churches that share the Malankara Church tradition are:\n#[[Malankara Orthodox Syrian Church]]: an autonomous and autocephalous oriental orthodox church.<ref>http://www.cnewa.org/default.aspx?ID=9&pagetypeID=9&sitecode=hq&pageno=1</ref> Catholicos of the East and [[Malankara Metropolitan]] entroned on the apostolic throne of [[Thomas the Apostle|Saint Thomas]] is the primate of the church.\n#[[Jacobite Syrian Christian Church]]: an autonomous oriental orthodox church under the jurisdiction of the [[Syriac Orthodox Patriarch of Antioch]].\n#[[Malankara Mar Thoma Syrian Church]]: an Independent and autonomous Malankara church under the jurisdiction of Marthoma Metropolitan\n#[[Syro-Malankara Catholic Church]]: a [[Sui iuris|self-governing]] [[Eastern Catholic]] church within the [[Catholic Church|Catholic]] communion.\n#[[Malabar Independent Syrian Church]]: an autonomous and autocephalous church under the jurisdiction of its own independent Metropolitan.\n\n==See also==\n<!---only for articles not mentioned above--->\n*'''Pazhaya Seminary''' [[Orthodox Theological Seminary, Kottayam]]\n* [[Malankara Metropolitan]]\n* [[List of Malankara Metropolitans]]\n\n==Footnotes==\n{{notelist}}\n\n==Notes==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==References==\n* {{Cite book|ref=harv|last1=Baum|first1=Wilhelm|authorlink1=Wilhelm Baum|last2=Winkler|first2=Dietmar W.|title=The Church of the East: A Concise History|year=2003|location=London-New York|publisher=Routledge-Curzon|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=CnSCAgAAQBAJ}}\n* {{Cite journal |last1= Chaput|first1= Pascale|year= 1999 |title= La Double identit\u00e9 des chr\u00e9tiens keralais : confessions et castes chr\u00e9tiennes au Kerala (Inde du Sud) / The Double Identity of Kerala Christians: Confessions and Christian Castes (South India)|journal= Archives des sciences sociales des religions|publisher= |volume= 106|issue= |pages= 5\u201323|url= http://www.persee.fr/web/revues/home/prescript/article/assr_0335-5985_1999_num_106_1_1084#|doi= }}\n* Fernando, Leonard; Gispert-Sauch, G.
