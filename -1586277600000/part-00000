Thousands of opposition activists were [[Internment|imprisoned]] without charge and as many as 91 killed.<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/6175517.stm Poland marks communist crackdown], [[BBC News]], 13 December 2006</ref> Although martial law was lifted in 1983, many of the [[political prisoner]]s were not released until a general [[amnesty]] in 1986.\n\nSince the 1970s, communist Poland was struggling economically. The First Secretary and ''de facto'' leader, [[Edward Gierek]], made large incessant loans from western creditors to achieve a better economic output that instead resulted in a domestic crisis. Basic goods and food were being heavily [[Rationing|rationed]] which acted as a stimuli for the establishment of a first anti-communist [[trade union]] in the [[Eastern Bloc]], known as Solidarity, in 1980. Gierek, who permitted the trade union to appear per the [[Gda\u0144sk Agreement]], was dismissed from his post less than a month later under pressure from the USSR and confined to [[house arrest]]. Poland's already somewhat liberal policies concerning the opposition were worrisome for hardliners in the [[Soviet Union]], who feared that the Poles may overthrow communism and ally themselves with the [[Western Bloc]]. The Soviets were particularly uneasy as the departure of Eastern Bloc's most populous nation from [[Comecon]] would trigger further financial and economic problems that would bring an end to communist rule in Central-Eastern Europe. After a series of strikes and demonstrations by employees of chief industrial regions, Poland was directly heading towards bankruptcy. \n\nThe [[Military Council of National Salvation]] was formed by the new First Secretary of the Polish United Workers' Party, General [[Wojciech Jaruzelski]], who was determined to put an end to the demonstrations and crush the opposition by force if necessary. There is speculation whether Jaruzelski instigated martial law to prevent bloodshed if the Soviets and other [[Warsaw Pact]] countries were to enter Poland under the mutual assistance treaty, like in the [[Hungarian Revolution of 1956]] and the [[invasion of Czechoslovakia in 1968]]. On 13 December 1981, Jaruzelski announced the introduction of martial law in a televised speech addressed to the entire nation. The Polish People's Army, [[Citizen's Militia]] (MO), [[ZOMO]] special units and tanks rolled onto the streets to scare off demonstrators, begin regular patrols and maintain [[curfew]]. Intercity travelling was forbidden unless a permit was granted by the authorities, food shortages intensified and censorship was placed on all media and [[post]]. The [[S\u0142u\u017cba Bezpiecze\u0144stwa|secret services (SB)]] [[wiretapped]] phones in public booths and state institutions. \n\nOn 16 December, pro-Solidarity miners organized a strike against the declaration of the martial law at the [[Wujek Coal Mine]] in the industrial city of [[Katowice]]. The ZOMO squads, nicknamed \"Communist [[Gestapo]]\" by the opposition, brutally [[Pacification of Wujek|pacified Wujek]], which resulted in the deaths of 9 miners. All other [[1982 demonstrations in Poland|demonstrations across Poland]] were met with armed force of the services, which utilized [[water cannons]], [[tear gas]], [[Baton (law enforcement)|batons]], truncheons and clubs to disperse crowds and beat protesters. Thousands were detained and some were tortured in state prisons. On 31 August 1982, in the copper-mining town of [[Lubin]], 3 people were mortally wounded by ZOMO. Until the end of the martial law on 22 July 1983, approximately 91 people were killed, though this figure varies and is still debated among historians.<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/6175517.stm Poland marks communist crackdown], [[BBC News]], 13 December 2006</ref>\n\n==Declaration==\nLed by [[General of the Army]] [[Wojciech Jaruzelski]], the [[Military Council of National Salvation]] (''Wojskowa Rada Ocalenia Narodowego'', WRON) usurped for itself powers reserved for wartime, hence the name. The plan was presented to the government of the [[Soviet Union]] before the declaration in March 1981.\n\nAppearing on Polish television at 6:00 a.m. on 13 December 1981, General Jaruzelski said:<ref>The original is available at [http://www.konflikty.pl/a,395,Czasy_najnowsze,Przemowienie_gen._Jaruzelskiego.html Konflikty.pl] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121112060937/http://www.konflikty.pl/a,395,Czasy_najnowsze,Przemowienie_gen._Jaruzelskiego.html |date=2012-11-12 }}</ref>\n\n<blockquote>Today I address myself to you as a soldier and as the head of the Polish government. I address you concerning extraordinarily important questions. Our homeland is at the edge of an abyss. The achievements of many generations and the Polish home that has been built up from the dust are about to turn into ruins. State structures are ceasing to function. Each day delivers new blows to the waning economy./.../<br>The atmosphere of conflicts, misunderstanding, hatred causes moral degradation, surpasses the limits of toleration. Strikes, the readiness to strike, actions of protest have become a norm of life. Even school youth are being drawn into this. Yesterday evening, many public buildings remained seized. The cries are voiced to physical reprisals with the 'reds', with people who have different opinions. <br>The cases of terror, threats and moral vendetta, of even direct violence are on the rise. A wave of impudent crimes, robberies and burglaries is running across the country. The underground business sharks' fortunes, already reaching millions, are growing. Chaos and demoralization have reached the magnitude of a catastrophe. People have reached the limit of psychological toleration. Many people are struck by despair. Not only days, but hours as well are bringing forth the all-national disaster./.../<br>Citizens!<br>The load of responsibility that falls on me on this dramatic moment in the Polish history is huge. It is my duty to take this responsibility - concerning the future of Poland, that my generation fought for on all the fronts of the war and for which they sacrificed the best years of their life. I declare, that today the Military Council of National Salvation has been formed. In accordance with the Constitution, the State Council has imposed martial law all over the country. I wish that everyone understood the motives of our actions.

period between 13 December 1981 and 22 July 1983, when the [[authoritarian]] [[communist government]] of the [[Polish People's Republic]] drastically restricted normal life by introducing [[martial law]] in an attempt to throttle political opposition, in particular the [[Solidarity Movement]]. Thousands of opposition activists were [[Internment|imprisoned]] without charge and as many as 91 killed.<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/6175517.stm Poland marks communist crackdown], [[BBC News]], 13 December 2006</ref> Although martial law was lifted in 1983, many of the [[political prisoner]]s were not released until a general [[amnesty]] in 1986.\n\nSince the 1970s, communist Poland was struggling economically. The First Secretary and ''de facto'' leader, [[Edward Gierek]], made large incessant loans from western creditors to achieve a better economic output that instead resulted in a domestic crisis. Basic goods and food were being heavily [[Rationing|rationed]] which acted as a stimuli for the establishment of a first anti-communist [[trade union]] in the [[Eastern Bloc]], known as Solidarity, in 1980. Gierek, who permitted the trade union to appear per the [[Gda\u0144sk Agreement]], was dismissed from his post less than a month later under pressure from the USSR and confined to [[house arrest]]. Poland's already somewhat liberal policies concerning the opposition were worrisome for hardliners in the [[Soviet Union]], who feared that the Poles may overthrow communism and ally themselves with the [[Western Bloc]]. The Soviets were particularly uneasy as the departure of Eastern Bloc's most populous nation from [[Comecon]] would trigger further financial and economic problems that would bring an end to communist rule in Central-Eastern Europe. After a series of strikes and demonstrations by employees of chief industrial regions, Poland was directly heading towards bankruptcy. \n\nThe [[Military Council of National Salvation]] was formed by the new First Secretary of the Polish United Workers' Party, General [[Wojciech Jaruzelski]], who was determined to put an end to the demonstrations and crush the opposition by force if necessary. There is speculation whether Jaruzelski instigated martial law to prevent bloodshed if the Soviets and other [[Warsaw Pact]] countries were to enter Poland under the mutual assistance treaty, like in the [[Hungarian Revolution of 1956]] and the [[invasion of Czechoslovakia in 1968]]. On 13 December 1981, Jaruzelski announced the introduction of martial law in a televised speech addressed to the entire nation. The Polish People's Army, [[Citizen's Militia]] (MO), [[ZOMO]] special units and tanks rolled onto the streets to scare off demonstrators, begin regular patrols and maintain [[curfew]]. Intercity travelling was forbidden unless a permit was granted by the authorities. Food rationing intensified and there were shortages of every basic product. The [[S\u0142u\u017cba Bezpiecze\u0144stwa|secret services (SB)]] [[wiretapped]] phones in public booths and state institutions. \n\nOn 16 December, pro-Solidarity miners organized a strike against the declaration of the martial law at the [[Wujek Coal Mine]] in the industrial city of [[Katowice]]. The ZOMO squads, nicknamed \"Communist [[Gestapo]]\" by the opposition, brutally [[Pacification of Wujek|pacified Wujek]], which resulted in the deaths of 9 miners. All other [[1982 demonstrations in Poland|demonstrations across Poland]] were met with armed force of the services, which utilized [[water cannons]], [[tear gas]], [[Baton (law enforcement)|batons]], truncheons and clubs to disperse crowds and beat protesters. Thousands were detained and some were tortured in state prisons. On 31 August 1982, in the copper-mining town of [[Lubin]], 3 people were mortally wounded by ZOMO. Until the end of the martial law on 22 July 1983, approximately 91 people were killed, though this figure varies and is still debated among historians.<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/6175517.stm Poland marks communist crackdown], [[BBC News]], 13 December 2006</ref>\n\n==Declaration==\nLed by [[General of the Army]] [[Wojciech Jaruzelski]], the [[Military Council of National Salvation]] (''Wojskowa Rada Ocalenia Narodowego'', WRON) usurped for itself powers reserved for wartime, hence the name.

Although most of their lyrics are in English, vocalist Carmelo Orlando sings in Italian occasionally in many of their songs. They released their first two albums, ''Wish I Could Dream It Again'' and ''Arte Novecento'', through Italian label [[Polyphemus]]. In the mid-1990s, they signed with [[Century Media]] to release their next three albums, ''[[Classica (Novembre album)|Classica]]'', ''[[Novembrine Waltz]]'', and ''[[Dreams d'Azur]]''. More recently, Novembre signed to [[Peaceville Records]], to release their sixth album ''[[Materia (Novembre album)|Materia]]'', which took on a progressive rock influence, and their seventh album, ''[[The Blue (Novembre album)|The Blue]]'', which saw a return to addition of [[death metal]]-esque passages. After 8 years of absence, Novembre completed work on a new studio album, which was released on Peaceville Records on April 1, 2016 called Ursa. Simultaneously, it was also announced that the band\u2019s longtime drummer & co-founder Giuseppe Orlando left the band, leaving Carmelo Orlando as the only original member.\n\n==Band

|title=Novembre {{!}} Biography {{!}} AllMusic |publisher=[[AllMusic]] |author=Eduardo Rivadavia |accessdate=December 22, 2013}}</ref>\n\n==Biography==\nStarting out in 1990 as an Italian [[death metal]] band (then called Catacomb), Novembre grew to develop a unique, atmospheric sound. Although most of their lyrics are in English, vocalist Carmelo Orlando sings in Italian occasionally in many of their songs. They released their first two albums, ''Wish I Could Dream It Again'' and ''Arte Novecento'', through Italian label [[Polyphemus]]. In the mid-90's, they signed with [[Century Media]] to release their next three albums, ''[[Classica (Novembre album)|Classica]]'', ''[[Novembrine Waltz]]'', and ''[[Dreams d'Azur]]''. More recently, Novembre signed to [[Peaceville Records]], to release their sixth album ''[[Materia (Novembre album)|Materia]]'', which took on a progressive rock influence, and their seventh album, ''[[The Blue (Novembre album)|The Blue]]'', which saw a return to addition of [[death metal]]-esque passages. After 8 years of absence, Novembre completed work on a new studio album, which was released on Peaceville Records on April 1, 2016 called Ursa. Simultaneously, it was also announced that the band\u2019s longtime drummer & co-founder Giuseppe Orlando left the band, leaving Carmelo Orlando as the only original member.\n\n==Band

For example, because the [[atmosphere of Mars]] does not contain an [[ozone layer]], it is also possible to make [[UV astronomy|UV observation]]s from the surface of Mars.\n\n==Seasons==\n{{See also|Climate of Mars|Timekeeping on Mars}}\n\nMars has an [[axial tilt]] of 25.19\u00b0, quite close to the value of 23.44\u00b0 for [[Earth]], and thus Mars has seasons of spring, summer, autumn, winter as Earth does. As on Earth, the southern and northern hemispheres have summer and winter at opposing times. You can also follow @tristan.w999 on instagram for more information \n\nHowever, the orbit of Mars has significantly greater [[eccentricity (orbit)|eccentricity]] than that of Earth. Therefore, the seasons are of unequal length, much more so than on Earth:\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!Season !! Sols<br />(on Mars) !! Days<br />(on Earth)\n|-\n| Northern spring, southern autumn: || 193.30 || 92.764\n|-\n| Northern summer, southern winter: || 178.64 || 93.647\n|-\n| Northern autumn, southern spring: || 142.70 || 89.836\n|-\n| Northern winter, southern summer: || 153.95 || 88.997\n|}\n\nIn practical terms, this means that summers and winters have different lengths and intensities in the northern and southern [[Hemispheres of Earth|hemispheres]]. Winters in the north are warm and short (because Mars is moving fast near its [[perihelion]]), while winters in the south are long and cold (Mars is moving slowly near [[aphelion]]). Similarly, summers in the north are long and cool, while summers in the south are short and hot. Therefore, extremes of temperature are considerably wider in the southern hemisphere than in the north.\n[[File:Mars sky at noon PIA01546.jpg|left|thumb|Mars sky at noon, as imaged by ''[[Mars Pathfinder]]'' (June, 1999).]]\n[[File:Mars sunset PIA01547.jpg|left|thumb|Mars sky at sunset, as imaged by ''[[Mars Pathfinder]]'' (June, 1999).]]\n[[File:MarsSunset losslesscrop.jpg|left|thumb|Mars sky at sunset, as imaged by the [[Spirit rover|''Spirit'' rover]] (May, 2005).]]\n[[File:Martian-Sunset-O-de-Goursac-Curiosity-2013.jpg|left|thumb|[[Extraterrestrial skies#Mars|Mars sky]] at [[Sunset#Planets|sunset]], as imaged by the [[Curiosity rover|''Curiosity'' rover]] (February 2013; Sun simulated by artist).]]\nThe [[seasonal lag]] on Mars is no more than a couple of days,<ref>[http://pds-atmospheres.nmsu.edu/education_and_outreach/encyclopedia/radiative_time_constant.htm radiative time constant<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> due to its lack of large bodies of water and similar factors that would provide a buffering effect. Thus, for temperatures on Mars, \"spring\" is approximately the mirror image of \"summer\" and \"autumn\" is approximately the mirror image of \"winter\" (if you consider the solstices and equinoxes to be the beginnings of their respective seasons), and if Mars had a circular orbit the maximum and minimum temperatures would occur a couple of days after the summer and winter [[solstice]]s rather than about one month after as on Earth. The only difference between spring temperatures and summer temperatures is due to the relatively high eccentricity of Mars's orbit: in northern spring Mars is farther from the Sun than during northern summer, and therefore by coincidence spring is slightly cooler than summer and autumn is slightly warmer than winter. However, in the southern hemisphere the opposite is true.\n\nThe temperature variations between spring and summer are much less than the very sharp variations that occur within a single Martian sol (solar day). On a daily basis, temperatures peak at local solar noon and reach a minimum at local midnight. This is similar to the effect in Earth's deserts, only much more pronounced.\n\nThe axial tilt and eccentricity of Earth (or Mars) are by no means fixed, but rather vary due to [[Perturbation (astronomy)|gravitational perturbations]] from other planets in the [[Solar System]] on a timescale of tens of thousands or hundreds of thousands of years. Thus, for example Earth's eccentricity of about 1% regularly fluctuates and can increase up to 6%, and at some point in the distant future the Earth will also have to deal with the calendrical implications of seasons of widely differing length and the major climate disruptions that go along with it.\n\nAside from the eccentricity, the Earth's [[axial tilt]] can also vary from 21.5\u00b0 to 24.5\u00b0, and the length of this \"obliquity cycle\" is 41,000 years. These and other similar cyclical changes are thought to be responsible for [[ice age]]s (see [[Milankovitch cycles]]). By contrast, the obliquity cycle for Mars is much more extreme: from 15\u00b0 to 35\u00b0 over a 124,000-year cycle. Some recent studies even suggest that over tens of millions of years, the swing may be as much as 0\u00b0 to 60\u00b0.<ref>[http://www.spacedaily.com/news/mars-water-science-00d.html The Obliquity of Mars<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>  Earth's large Moon apparently plays an important role in keeping Earth's axial tilt within reasonable bounds; Mars has no such stabilizing influence and its axial tilt can vary more chaotically.\n\n==The color of the sky==\nThe normal hue of the sky during the daytime is a pinkish-red; however, in the vicinity of the setting or rising sun it is blue. This is the exact opposite of the situation on Earth. However, during the day the sky is a yellow-brown \"butterscotch\" color.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://humbabe.arc.nasa.gov/mgcm/faq/sky.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2005-04-23 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20040810170442/http://humbabe.arc.nasa.gov/mgcm/faq/sky.html |archivedate=2004-08-10 }}</ref> On Mars, [[Rayleigh scattering]] is usually a very small effect. It is believed that the color of the sky is caused by the presence of 1% by volume of [[magnetite]] in the dust particles. Twilight lasts a long time after the Sun has set and before it rises, because of all the dust in Mars's atmosphere. At times, the Martian sky takes on a violet color, due to scattering of light by very small water ice particles in clouds.<ref>[https://www.jpl.nasa.gov/spaceimages/details.php?id=PIA00915 JPL: A Violet Martian Sky]</ref>\n\nGenerating accurate true-color images of Mars's surface is surprisingly complicated.<ref>[http://www.badastronomy.com/bad/misc/hoagland/mars_colors.html Phil Plait's Bad Astronomy: Misconceptions: What Color is Mars?]</ref> There is much variation in the color of the sky as reproduced in published images; many of those images, however, are using filters to maximize the science value and are not trying to show true color.

The maximum angular separation of the Earth and Moon varies considerably according to the relative distance between the Earth and Mars: it is about 17\u2032 when Earth is closest to Mars (near [[inferior conjunction]]) but only about 3.5\u2032 when the Earth is farthest from Mars (near [[superior conjunction]]). For comparison, the apparent diameter of the Moon from Earth is 31\u2032.\n[[Image:Earth and Moon from Mars PIA04531.jpg|thumb|left|200px|Earth and Moon from Mars, imaged by [[Mars Global Surveyor]] on May 8, 2003, 13:00 [[UTC]].

The former case would correspond to a lunar [[occultation]] of Mars as seen from Earth, and because the Moon's [[albedo]] is considerably less than that of the Earth, a dip in overall brightness would occur, although this would be too small to be noticeable by casual naked eye observers because the size of the Moon is much smaller than that of the Earth and it would cover only a small fraction of the Earth's disk.\n\n[[Mars Global Surveyor]] imaged the Earth and Moon on May 8, 2003 13:00 UTC, very close to maximum angular [[Elongation (astronomy)|elongation]] from the [[Sun]] and at a distance of 0.930 AU from Mars. The [[apparent magnitude]]s were given as \u22122.5 and +0.9.<ref>[http://www.msss.com/mars_images/moc/2003/05/22/ Mars Global Surveyor MOC2-368 Release]</ref> At different times the actual magnitudes will vary considerably depending on distance and the phases of the Earth and Moon.\n\nFrom one day to the next, the view of the Moon would change very differently for an observer on Mars than for an observer on Earth. The [[lunar phase|phase of the Moon]] as seen from Mars would not change much from day to day; it would match the phase of the Earth, and would only gradually change as both Earth and Moon move in their orbits around the Sun. On the other hand, an observer on Mars would see the Moon rotate, with the same period as its orbital period, and would see far side features that can never be seen from Earth.\n\nSince Earth is an inner planet, observers on Mars can occasionally view [[transit of Earth from Mars|transits of Earth]] across the [[Sun]]. The next one will take place in 2084. They can also view [[transit of Mercury from Mars|transits of Mercury]] and transits of Venus.\n\n===Phobos and Deimos===\n[[Image:PIA05553.gif|thumb|Phobos [[Transit of Phobos from Mars|eclipses]] the Sun, imaged by [[Mars Exploration Rover|MER]]]]\n\nThe moon [[Phobos (moon)|Phobos]] appears about one third the angular diameter that the full [[Moon]] appears from Earth; on the other hand, [[Deimos (moon)|Deimos]] appears more or less starlike with a disk barely discernible if at all. Phobos orbits so fast (with a period of just under one third of a sol) that it rises in the west and sets in the east, and does so twice per sol; Deimos on the other hand rises in the east and sets in the west, but orbits only a few hours slower than a Martian sol, so it spends about two and a half sols above the horizon at a time.\n\nThe maximum brightness of Phobos at \"full moon\" is about magnitude \u22129 or \u221210, while for Deimos it is about \u22125.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.arm.ac.uk/~aac/mars/Information.html |title=Astronomical Phenomena From Mars |access-date=2005-04-23 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080602015650/http://www.arm.ac.uk/~aac/mars/Information.html |archive-date=2008-06-02 |url-status=dead }}</ref> By comparison, the full [[Moon]] as seen from Earth is considerably brighter at magnitude \u221212.7. Phobos is still bright enough to cast shadows; Deimos is only slightly brighter than [[Venus]] is from Earth. Just like Earth's Moon, both Phobos and Deimos are considerably fainter at non-full phases. Unlike Earth's Moon, Phobos's phases and angular diameter visibly change from hour to hour; Deimos is too small for its phases to be visible with the naked eye.\n\nBoth Phobos and Deimos have low-inclination equatorial orbits and orbit fairly close to Mars. As a result, Phobos is not visible from latitudes north of 70.4\u00b0N or south of 70.4\u00b0S; Deimos is not visible from latitudes north of 82.7\u00b0N or south of 82.7\u00b0S. Observers at high latitudes (less than 70.4\u00b0) would see a noticeably smaller angular diameter for Phobos because they are farther away from it. Similarly, equatorial observers of Phobos would see a noticeably smaller angular diameter for Phobos when it is rising and setting, compared to when it is overhead.\n[[Image:Spirit phobos deimos.jpg|left|thumb|Phobos and Deimos from the [[Spirit rover]]. Courtesy NASA/JPL-Caltech]]\n\nObservers on Mars can view [[transit of Phobos from Mars|transits of Phobos]] and [[transit of Deimos from Mars|transits of Deimos]] across the [[Sun]]. The transits of Phobos could also be called partial [[Solar eclipses on Mars|eclipses of the Sun]] by Phobos, since the angular diameter of Phobos is up to half the angular diameter of the Sun. However, in the case of Deimos the term \"transit\" is appropriate, since it appears as a small dot on the Sun's disk.\n\nSince Phobos orbits in a low-inclination equatorial orbit, there is a seasonal variation in the latitude of the position of [[shadow of Phobos on Mars|Phobos's shadow]] projected onto the Martian surface, cycling from far north to far south and back again. At any given fixed geographical location on Mars, there are two intervals per Martian year when the shadow is passing through its latitude and about half a dozen transits of Phobos can be observed at that geographical location over a couple of weeks during each such interval. The situation is similar for Deimos, except only zero or one transits occur during such an interval.\n\nIt is easy to see that the shadow always falls on the \"winter hemisphere\", except when it crosses the equator during the [[vernal equinox]] and the [[autumnal equinox]]. Thus transits of Phobos and Deimos happen during Martian autumn and winter in the northern hemisphere and the southern hemisphere. Close to the equator they tend to happen around the autumnal equinox and the vernal equinox; farther from the equator they tend to happen closer to the [[solstice|winter solstice]]. In either case, the two intervals when transits can take place occur more or less symmetrically before and after the winter solstice (however, the large eccentricity of Mars's orbit prevents true symmetry).\n[[Image:Earth Sol63A UFO-A067R1.jpg|thumb|First meteor photographed from Mars, March 7, 2004, by [[Spirit rover|MER ''Spirit'']]]]\n\nObservers on Mars can also view [[lunar eclipse]]s of Phobos and Deimos. Phobos spends about an hour in Mars's shadow; for Deimos it is about two hours. Surprisingly, despite its orbit being nearly in the plane of Mars's equator and despite its very close distance to Mars, there are some occasions when Phobos escapes being eclipsed.\n \nPhobos and Deimos both have [[synchronous rotation]], which means that they have a \"far side\" that observers on the surface of Mars can't see. The phenomenon of [[libration]] occurs for Phobos as it does for Earth's [[Moon]], despite the low inclination and eccentricity of Phobos's orbit.<ref>[http://adsbit.harvard.edu/cgi-bin/nph-iarticle_query?1990A%26A...233..235B 1990A&A...233..235B Page 235<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref><ref>[http://adsbit.harvard.edu/cgi-bin/nph-iarticle_query?1991BAICz..42..271P 1991BAICz..42..271P Page 271<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>\nDue to the effect of librations and the [[parallax]] due to the close distance of Phobos, by observing at high and low latitudes and observing as Phobos is rising and setting, the overall total coverage of Phobos's surface that is visible at one time or another from one location or another on Mars's surface is considerably higher than 50%.\n\nThe large [[Stickney crater]] is visible along one edge of the face of Phobos. It is easily visible with the naked eye from the surface of Mars.\n\n===Comets and meteors===\n[[File:Mars-C2013A1SidingSpring-Orbits-20141019.png|thumb|right|250px|Projected path of [[C/2013 A1|Comet Siding Spring]] [[Astronomy on Mars#Comets and meteors|passing]] [[Mars]] on 19 October 2014.]]\nSince Mars has an atmosphere that is relatively transparent at optical wavelengths (just like Earth, albeit much thinner), [[meteor]]s will occasionally be seen. [[Meteor shower]]s on Earth occur when the Earth intersects the orbit of a [[comet]], and likewise, Mars also has meteor showers, although these are different from the ones on Earth.\n[[File:NASA-14090-Comet-C2013A1-SidingSpring-Hubble-20140311.jpg|thumb|left|200px|[[C/2013 A1|Comet Siding Spring]] as seen by [[Hubble Space Telescope|Hubble]] on 11 March 2014.]]\nThe first meteor photographed on Mars (on March 7, 2004 by the ''[[Spirit (rover)|Spirit]]'' rover) is now believed to have been part of a meteor shower whose parent body was comet [[114P/Wiseman-Skiff]].

Because of its proximity to the pole, Deneb never sets in nearly all of Mars's northern hemisphere. Except in areas close to the equator, Deneb permanently circles the North pole. The orientation of Deneb and Sadr would make a useful clock hand for telling [[sidereal time]].\n\nMars's north celestial pole is also only a few degrees away from the [[galactic plane]]. Thus the [[Milky Way]], especially rich in the area of Cygnus, is always visible from the northern hemisphere.\n\nThe South celestial pole is correspondingly found at {{RA|9|10|42}} and {{DEC|-52|53.0}}, which is a couple of degrees from the 2.5-magnitude star [[Kappa Velorum]] (which is at {{RA|9|22|06.85}} {{DEC|-55|00.6}}), which could therefore be considered the southern polar star. The star [[Canopus (star)|Canopus]], second-brightest in the sky, is a circumpolar star for most southern latitudes.\n\nThe [[zodiac]] constellations of Mars's [[ecliptic]] are almost the same as those of Earth &mdash; after all, the two ecliptic planes only have a mutual inclination of 1.85\u00b0 &mdash; but on Mars, the Sun spends 6 days in the [[constellation]] [[Cetus]], leaving and re-entering [[Pisces (constellation)|Pisces]] as it does so, making a total of 14 zodiacal constellations. The equinoxes and [[solstice]]s are different as well: for the northern hemisphere, [[vernal equinox]] is in [[Ophiuchus]] (compared to [[Pisces (constellation)|Pisces]] on Earth), summer solstice is at the border of [[Aquarius (constellation)|Aquarius]] and Pisces, [[autumnal equinox]] is in [[Taurus (constellation)|Taurus]], and winter solstice is in [[Virgo (constellation)|Virgo]].\n\nAs on Earth, [[precession]] will cause the solstices and equinoxes to cycle through the zodiac constellations over thousands and tens of thousands of years.\n\n===Long-term variations===<!-- This section is linked from [[Precession (astronomy)]] -->\n[[Image:Mars Ice Age PIA04933 modest.jpg|thumb|An illustration of what Mars may have looked like during an [[ice age]] about 400,000 years ago caused by a large [[axial tilt]]]]\n\nAs on Earth, the effect of [[Precession (astronomy)|precession]] causes the north and south celestial poles to move in a very large circle, but on Mars the cycle is 175,000 Earth years\n<ref>{{cite journal\n |author1=Alex S.

However, on Mars, this cycle is 83,600 years rather than 112,000 years as on Earth.\n\nOn both Earth and Mars, these two precessions are in opposite directions, and therefore add, to make the precession cycle between the [[Year#Sidereal.2C tropical.2C and anomalistic years|tropical and anomalistic years]] 21,000 years on Earth and 56,600 years on Mars.\n\nAs on Earth, the period of rotation of Mars (the length of its day) is slowing down. However, this effect is three orders of magnitude smaller than on Earth because the gravitational effect of Phobos is negligible and the effect is mainly due to the Sun.<ref>[http://adsbit.harvard.edu/cgi-bin/nph-iarticle_query?1988BAICz..39..168B 1988BAICz..39..168B Page 168<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> On Earth, the gravitational influence of the Moon has a much greater effect. Eventually, in the far future, the length of a day on Earth will equal and then exceed the length of a day on Mars.\n\nAs on Earth, Mars experiences [[Milankovitch cycles]] that cause its [[axial tilt]] (obliquity) and orbital [[eccentricity (orbit)|eccentricity]] to vary over long periods of time, which has long-term effects on its climate. The variation of Mars's axial tilt is much larger than for Earth because it lacks the stabilizing influence of a large moon like Earth's moon.

For example, because the [[atmosphere of Mars]] does not contain an [[ozone layer]], it is also possible to make [[UV astronomy|UV observation]]s from the surface of Mars.\n\n==Seasons==\n{{See also|Climate of Mars|Timekeeping on Mars}}\n\nMars has an [[axial tilt]] of 25.19\u00b0, quite close to the value of 23.44\u00b0 for [[Earth]], and thus Mars has seasons of spring, summer, autumn, winter as Earth does. As on Earth, the southern and northern hemispheres have summer and winter at opposing times.\n\nHowever, the orbit of Mars has significantly greater [[eccentricity (orbit)|eccentricity]] than that of Earth. Therefore, the seasons are of unequal length, much more so than on Earth:\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!Season !! Sols<br />(on Mars) !! Days<br />(on Earth)\n|-\n| Northern spring, southern autumn: || 193.30 || 92.764\n|-\n| Northern summer, southern winter: || 178.64 || 93.647\n|-\n| Northern autumn, southern spring: || 142.70 || 89.836\n|-\n| Northern winter, southern summer: || 153.95 || 88.997\n|}\n\nIn practical terms, this means that summers and winters have different lengths and intensities in the northern and southern [[Hemispheres of Earth|hemispheres]]. Winters in the north are warm and short (because Mars is moving fast near its [[perihelion]]), while winters in the south are long and cold (Mars is moving slowly near [[aphelion]]). Similarly, summers in the north are long and cool, while summers in the south are short and hot. Therefore, extremes of temperature are considerably wider in the southern hemisphere than in the north.\n[[File:Mars sky at noon PIA01546.jpg|left|thumb|Mars sky at noon, as imaged by ''[[Mars Pathfinder]]'' (June, 1999).]]\n[[File:Mars sunset PIA01547.jpg|left|thumb|Mars sky at sunset, as imaged by ''[[Mars Pathfinder]]'' (June, 1999).]]\n[[File:MarsSunset losslesscrop.jpg|left|thumb|Mars sky at sunset, as imaged by the [[Spirit rover|''Spirit'' rover]] (May, 2005).]]\n[[File:Martian-Sunset-O-de-Goursac-Curiosity-2013.jpg|left|thumb|[[Extraterrestrial skies#Mars|Mars sky]] at [[Sunset#Planets|sunset]], as imaged by the [[Curiosity rover|''Curiosity'' rover]] (February 2013; Sun simulated by artist).]]\nThe [[seasonal lag]] on Mars is no more than a couple of days,<ref>[http://pds-atmospheres.nmsu.edu/education_and_outreach/encyclopedia/radiative_time_constant.htm radiative time constant<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> due to its lack of large bodies of water and similar factors that would provide a buffering effect. Thus, for temperatures on Mars, \"spring\" is approximately the mirror image of \"summer\" and \"autumn\" is approximately the mirror image of \"winter\" (if you consider the solstices and equinoxes to be the beginnings of their respective seasons), and if Mars had a circular orbit the maximum and minimum temperatures would occur a couple of days after the summer and winter [[solstice]]s rather than about one month after as on Earth. The only difference between spring temperatures and summer temperatures is due to the relatively high eccentricity of Mars's orbit: in northern spring Mars is farther from the Sun than during northern summer, and therefore by coincidence spring is slightly cooler than summer and autumn is slightly warmer than winter. However, in the southern hemisphere the opposite is true.\n\nThe temperature variations between spring and summer are much less than the very sharp variations that occur within a single Martian sol (solar day). On a daily basis, temperatures peak at local solar noon and reach a minimum at local midnight. This is similar to the effect in Earth's deserts, only much more pronounced.\n\nThe axial tilt and eccentricity of Earth (or Mars) are by no means fixed, but rather vary due to [[Perturbation (astronomy)|gravitational perturbations]] from other planets in the [[Solar System]] on a timescale of tens of thousands or hundreds of thousands of years. Thus, for example Earth's eccentricity of about 1% regularly fluctuates and can increase up to 6%, and at some point in the distant future the Earth will also have to deal with the calendrical implications of seasons of widely differing length and the major climate disruptions that go along with it.\n\nAside from the eccentricity, the Earth's [[axial tilt]] can also vary from 21.5\u00b0 to 24.5\u00b0, and the length of this \"obliquity cycle\" is 41,000 years. These and other similar cyclical changes are thought to be responsible for [[ice age]]s (see [[Milankovitch cycles]]). By contrast, the obliquity cycle for Mars is much more extreme: from 15\u00b0 to 35\u00b0 over a 124,000-year cycle. Some recent studies even suggest that over tens of millions of years, the swing may be as much as 0\u00b0 to 60\u00b0.<ref>[http://www.spacedaily.com/news/mars-water-science-00d.html The Obliquity of Mars<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>  Earth's large Moon apparently plays an important role in keeping Earth's axial tilt within reasonable bounds; Mars has no such stabilizing influence and its axial tilt can vary more chaotically.\n\n==The color of the sky==\nThe normal hue of the sky during the daytime is a pinkish-red; however, in the vicinity of the setting or rising sun it is blue. This is the exact opposite of the situation on Earth. However, during the day the sky is a yellow-brown \"butterscotch\" color.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://humbabe.arc.nasa.gov/mgcm/faq/sky.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2005-04-23 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20040810170442/http://humbabe.arc.nasa.gov/mgcm/faq/sky.html |archivedate=2004-08-10 }}</ref> On Mars, [[Rayleigh scattering]] is usually a very small effect.

At times, the Martian sky takes on a violet color, due to scattering of light by very small water ice particles in clouds.<ref>[https://www.jpl.nasa.gov/spaceimages/details.php?id=PIA00915 JPL: A Violet Martian Sky]</ref>\n\nGenerating accurate true-color images of Mars's surface is surprisingly complicated.<ref>[http://www.badastronomy.com/bad/misc/hoagland/mars_colors.html Phil Plait's Bad Astronomy: Misconceptions: What Color is Mars?]</ref> There is much variation in the color of the sky as reproduced in published images; many of those images, however, are using filters to maximize the science value and are not trying to show true color. Nevertheless, for many years, the sky on Mars was thought to be more pinkish than it now is believed to be.\n\n==Astronomical phenomena==\n\n===Earth and Moon===\n[[File:PIA21260 - Earth and Its Moon, as Seen From Mars.jpg|thumb|center|400px|<center>[[Earth]] and the [[Moon]] as viewed from [[Mars]]<br />([[Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter|MRO]]; [[HiRISE]]; November 20, 2016)<ref name=\"NYT-20170109\">{{cite news |last=St. Fleur |first=Nicholas |title=Looking at Your Home Planet from Mars |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2017/01/09/science/earth-from-mars-photo.html |date=January 9, 2017 |work=[[The New York Times]] |accessdate=January 9, 2017 }}</ref></center>]]\nAs seen from Mars, the Earth is an inner planet like Venus (a \"morning star\" or \"evening star\").

By contrast, observers on Earth cannot see any other planet's satellites with the naked eye, and it was not until soon after the invention of the telescope that the first such satellites were discovered ([[Jupiter]]'s [[Galilean moons]]).\n[[Image:PIA05547-Spirit Rover-Earth seen from Mars.png|thumb|right|200px|Earth as morning star, imaged by [[Spirit rover|MER ''Spirit'']] on March 7, 2004]]\nAt maximum angular separation, the Earth and Moon would be easily distinguished as a double planet, but about one week later they would merge into a single point of light (to the naked eye), and then about a week after that, the Moon would reach maximum angular separation on the opposite side. The maximum angular separation of the Earth and Moon varies considerably according to the relative distance between the Earth and Mars: it is about 17\u2032 when Earth is closest to Mars (near [[inferior conjunction]]) but only about 3.5\u2032 when the Earth is farthest from Mars (near [[superior conjunction]]). For comparison, the apparent diameter of the Moon from Earth is 31\u2032.\n[[Image:Earth and Moon from Mars PIA04531.jpg|thumb|left|200px|Earth and Moon from Mars, imaged by [[Mars Global Surveyor]] on May 8, 2003, 13:00 [[UTC]]. South America is visible.]]\nThe minimum angular separation would be less than 1\u2032, and occasionally the Moon would be seen to [[astronomical transit|transit]] in front of or pass behind (be occulted by) the Earth. The former case would correspond to a lunar [[occultation]] of Mars as seen from Earth, and because the Moon's [[albedo]] is considerably less than that of the Earth, a dip in overall brightness would occur, although this would be too small to be noticeable by casual naked eye observers because the size of the Moon is much smaller than that of the Earth and it would cover only a small fraction of the Earth's disk.\n\n[[Mars Global Surveyor]] imaged the Earth and Moon on May 8, 2003 13:00 UTC, very close to maximum angular [[Elongation (astronomy)|elongation]] from the [[Sun]] and at a distance of 0.930 AU from Mars. The [[apparent magnitude]]s were given as \u22122.5 and +0.9.<ref>[http://www.msss.com/mars_images/moc/2003/05/22/ Mars Global Surveyor MOC2-368 Release]</ref> At different times the actual magnitudes will vary considerably depending on distance and the phases of the Earth and Moon.\n\nFrom one day to the next, the view of the Moon would change very differently for an observer on Mars than for an observer on Earth. The [[lunar phase|phase of the Moon]] as seen from Mars would not change much from day to day; it would match the phase of the Earth, and would only gradually change as both Earth and Moon move in their orbits around the Sun. On the other hand, an observer on Mars would see the Moon rotate, with the same period as its orbital period, and would see far side features that can never be seen from Earth.\n\nSince Earth is an inner planet, observers on Mars can occasionally view [[transit of Earth from Mars|transits of Earth]] across the [[Sun]]. The next one will take place in 2084. They can also view [[transit of Mercury from Mars|transits of Mercury]] and transits of Venus.\n\n===Phobos and Deimos===\n[[Image:PIA05553.gif|thumb|Phobos [[Transit of Phobos from Mars|eclipses]] the Sun, imaged by [[Mars Exploration Rover|MER]]]]\n\nThe moon [[Phobos (moon)|Phobos]] appears about one third the angular diameter that the full [[Moon]] appears from Earth; on the other hand, [[Deimos (moon)|Deimos]] appears more or less starlike with a disk barely discernible if at all. Phobos orbits so fast (with a period of just under one third of a sol) that it rises in the west and sets in the east, and does so twice per sol; Deimos on the other hand rises in the east and sets in the west, but orbits only a few hours slower than a Martian sol, so it spends about two and a half sols above the horizon at a time.\n\nThe maximum brightness of Phobos at \"full moon\" is about magnitude \u22129 or \u221210, while for Deimos it is about \u22125.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.arm.ac.uk/~aac/mars/Information.html |title=Astronomical Phenomena From Mars |access-date=2005-04-23 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080602015650/http://www.arm.ac.uk/~aac/mars/Information.html |archive-date=2008-06-02 |url-status=dead }}</ref> By comparison, the full [[Moon]] as seen from Earth is considerably brighter at magnitude \u221212.7. Phobos is still bright enough to cast shadows; Deimos is only slightly brighter than [[Venus]] is from Earth. Just like Earth's Moon, both Phobos and Deimos are considerably fainter at non-full phases. Unlike Earth's Moon, Phobos's phases and angular diameter visibly change from hour to hour; Deimos is too small for its phases to be visible with the naked eye.\n\nBoth Phobos and Deimos have low-inclination equatorial orbits and orbit fairly close to Mars. As a result, Phobos is not visible from latitudes north of 70.4\u00b0N or south of 70.4\u00b0S; Deimos is not visible from latitudes north of 82.7\u00b0N or south of 82.7\u00b0S. Observers at high latitudes (less than 70.4\u00b0) would see a noticeably smaller angular diameter for Phobos because they are farther away from it. Similarly, equatorial observers of Phobos would see a noticeably smaller angular diameter for Phobos when it is rising and setting, compared to when it is overhead.\n[[Image:Spirit phobos deimos.jpg|left|thumb|Phobos and Deimos from the [[Spirit rover]]. Courtesy NASA/JPL-Caltech]]\n\nObservers on Mars can view [[transit of Phobos from Mars|transits of Phobos]] and [[transit of Deimos from Mars|transits of Deimos]] across the [[Sun]]. The transits of Phobos could also be called partial [[Solar eclipses on Mars|eclipses of the Sun]] by Phobos, since the angular diameter of Phobos is up to half the angular diameter of the Sun. However, in the case of Deimos the term \"transit\" is appropriate, since it appears as a small dot on the Sun's disk.\n\nSince Phobos orbits in a low-inclination equatorial orbit, there is a seasonal variation in the latitude of the position of [[shadow of Phobos on Mars|Phobos's shadow]] projected onto the Martian surface, cycling from far north to far south and back again. At any given fixed geographical location on Mars, there are two intervals per Martian year when the shadow is passing through its latitude and about half a dozen transits of Phobos can be observed at that geographical location over a couple of weeks during each such interval. The situation is similar for Deimos, except only zero or one transits occur during such an interval.\n\nIt is easy to see that the shadow always falls on the \"winter hemisphere\", except when it crosses the equator during the [[vernal equinox]] and the [[autumnal equinox]]. Thus transits of Phobos and Deimos happen during Martian autumn and winter in the northern hemisphere and the southern hemisphere. Close to the equator they tend to happen around the autumnal equinox and the vernal equinox; farther from the equator they tend to happen closer to the [[solstice|winter solstice]]. In either case, the two intervals when transits can take place occur more or less symmetrically before and after the winter solstice (however, the large eccentricity of Mars's orbit prevents true symmetry).\n[[Image:Earth Sol63A UFO-A067R1.jpg|thumb|First meteor photographed from Mars, March 7, 2004, by [[Spirit rover|MER ''Spirit'']]]]\n\nObservers on Mars can also view [[lunar eclipse]]s of Phobos and Deimos. Phobos spends about an hour in Mars's shadow; for Deimos it is about two hours. Surprisingly, despite its orbit being nearly in the plane of Mars's equator and despite its very close distance to Mars, there are some occasions when Phobos escapes being eclipsed.\n \nPhobos and Deimos both have [[synchronous rotation]], which means that they have a \"far side\" that observers on the surface of Mars can't see. The phenomenon of [[libration]] occurs for Phobos as it does for Earth's [[Moon]], despite the low inclination and eccentricity of Phobos's orbit.<ref>[http://adsbit.harvard.edu/cgi-bin/nph-iarticle_query?1990A%26A...233..235B 1990A&A...233..235B Page 235<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref><ref>[http://adsbit.harvard.edu/cgi-bin/nph-iarticle_query?1991BAICz..42..271P 1991BAICz..42..271P Page 271<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>\nDue to the effect of librations and the [[parallax]] due to the close distance of Phobos, by observing at high and low latitudes and observing as Phobos is rising and setting, the overall total coverage of Phobos's surface that is visible at one time or another from one location or another on Mars's surface is considerably higher than 50%.\n\nThe large [[Stickney crater]] is visible along one edge of the face of Phobos. It is easily visible with the naked eye from the surface of Mars.\n\n===Comets and meteors===\n[[File:Mars-C2013A1SidingSpring-Orbits-20141019.png|thumb|right|250px|Projected path of [[C/2013 A1|Comet Siding Spring]] [[Astronomy on Mars#Comets and meteors|passing]] [[Mars]] on 19 October 2014.]]\nSince Mars has an atmosphere that is relatively transparent at optical wavelengths (just like Earth, albeit much thinner), [[meteor]]s will occasionally be seen. [[Meteor shower]]s on Earth occur when the Earth intersects the orbit of a [[comet]], and likewise, Mars also has meteor showers, although these are different from the ones on Earth.\n[[File:NASA-14090-Comet-C2013A1-SidingSpring-Hubble-20140311.jpg|thumb|left|200px|[[C/2013 A1|Comet Siding Spring]] as seen by [[Hubble Space Telescope|Hubble]] on 11 March 2014.]]\nThe first meteor photographed on Mars (on March 7, 2004 by the ''[[Spirit (rover)|Spirit]]'' rover) is now believed to have been part of a meteor shower whose parent body was comet [[114P/Wiseman-Skiff]]. Because the radiant was in the constellation [[Cepheus (constellation)|Cepheus]], this meteor shower could be dubbed the Martian Cepheids.<ref>https://www.researchgate.net/publication/7811359_Extraterrestrial_meteors_A_martian_meteor_and_its_parent_comet</ref>\n\nAs on Earth, when a meteor is large enough to actually impact with the surface (without burning up completely in the atmosphere), it becomes a [[meteorite]].

Because of its proximity to the pole, Deneb never sets in nearly all of Mars's northern hemisphere. Except in areas close to the equator, Deneb permanently circles the North pole. The orientation of Deneb and Sadr would make a useful clock hand for telling [[sidereal time]].\n\nMars's north celestial pole is also only a few degrees away from the [[galactic plane]]. Thus the [[Milky Way]], especially rich in the area of Cygnus, is always visible from the northern hemisphere.\n\nThe South celestial pole is correspondingly found at {{RA|9|10|42}} and {{DEC|-52|53.0}}, which is a couple of degrees from the 2.5-magnitude star [[Kappa Velorum]] (which is at {{RA|9|22|06.85}} {{DEC|-55|00.6}}), which could therefore be considered the southern polar star. The star [[Canopus (star)|Canopus]], second-brightest in the sky, is a circumpolar star for most southern latitudes.\n\nThe [[zodiac]] constellations of Mars's [[ecliptic]] are almost the same as those of Earth &mdash; after all, the two ecliptic planes only have a mutual inclination of 1.85\u00b0 &mdash; but on Mars, the Sun spends 6 days in the [[constellation]] [[Cetus]], leaving and re-entering [[Pisces (constellation)|Pisces]] as it does so, making a total of 14 zodiacal constellations. The equinoxes and [[solstice]]s are different as well: for the northern hemisphere, [[vernal equinox]] is in [[Ophiuchus]] (compared to [[Pisces (constellation)|Pisces]] on Earth), summer solstice is at the border of [[Aquarius (constellation)|Aquarius]] and Pisces, [[autumnal equinox]] is in [[Taurus (constellation)|Taurus]], and winter solstice is in [[Virgo (constellation)|Virgo]].\n\nAs on Earth, [[precession]] will cause the solstices and equinoxes to cycle through the zodiac constellations over thousands and tens of thousands of years.\n\n===Long-term variations===<!-- This section is linked from [[Precession (astronomy)]] -->\n[[Image:Mars Ice Age PIA04933 modest.jpg|thumb|An illustration of what Mars may have looked like during an [[ice age]] about 400,000 years ago caused by a large [[axial tilt]]]]\n\nAs on Earth, the effect of [[Precession (astronomy)|precession]] causes the north and south celestial poles to move in a very large circle, but on Mars the cycle is 175,000 Earth years\n<ref>{{cite journal\n |author1=Alex S.

However, on Mars, this cycle is 83,600 years rather than 112,000 years as on Earth.\n\nOn both Earth and Mars, these two precessions are in opposite directions, and therefore add, to make the precession cycle between the [[Year#Sidereal.2C tropical.2C and anomalistic years|tropical and anomalistic years]] 21,000 years on Earth and 56,600 years on Mars.\n\nAs on Earth, the period of rotation of Mars (the length of its day) is slowing down. However, this effect is three orders of magnitude smaller than on Earth because the gravitational effect of Phobos is negligible and the effect is mainly due to the Sun.<ref>[http://adsbit.harvard.edu/cgi-bin/nph-iarticle_query?1988BAICz..39..168B 1988BAICz..39..168B Page 168<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> On Earth, the gravitational influence of the Moon has a much greater effect. Eventually, in the far future, the length of a day on Earth will equal and then exceed the length of a day on Mars.\n\nAs on Earth, Mars experiences [[Milankovitch cycles]] that cause its [[axial tilt]] (obliquity) and orbital [[eccentricity (orbit)|eccentricity]] to vary over long periods of time, which has long-term effects on its climate. The variation of Mars's axial tilt is much larger than for Earth because it lacks the stabilizing influence of a large moon like Earth's moon.

The group was short lived however, possibly because of insufficient support/promotion from their label, Payday, but the two continued to collaborate on many occasions afterwards, starting with an appearance on \"Fat Cat Song\" and its remix, from [[Slum Village]]'s ''[[Fan-Tas-Tic (Vol. 1)]]''.\n\nIn an interview, he spoke in regards to his time and music creations alongside Dilla, as well as the producer's work ethic:\n\n{{cquote|Dilla didn\u2019t fuck around in the studio. Everybody else had to adjust their style to keep up with Dilla, or if they ever wanted the chance to work with Dilla. You had to be able to knock out your verse in one take. I\u2019ve seen Dilla make beats in 10 minutes. We made that track off of [[Welcome 2 Detroit]] in 10 minutes flat. We completed the whole Dedication To The Suckers EP from scratch in less than one night. He did the beats and I laid the verses. We started at 9 p.m. and finished by 12 midnight.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.stonesthrow.com/news/2006/03/spiritualized|title=Spiritualized - Stones Throw Records|work=stonesthrow.com}}</ref>}}\n \nHis first full-length album, ''[[The Undeniable LP]]'' was released on June 22, 2004, on ''Barak Records''.  It featured appearances from Slum Village, [[Dwele]], Big Tone of 87 Wasted Youth, and [[Obie Trice]].  Kat released a [[12-inch single]] in late 2006 for the song Cold Steel produced by J Dilla, he then followed it with his latest LP, [[Carte Blanche (Phat Kat album)|Carte Blanche]], on April 24 on Look Records.
