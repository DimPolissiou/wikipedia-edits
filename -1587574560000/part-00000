National law may become international law when treaties permit national jurisdiction to [[supranational union|supranational]] tribunals such as the [[European Court of Human Rights]] or the [[International Criminal Court]].

Among the earliest examples are peace treaties between the [[Mesopotamia]]n city-states of [[Lagash]] and [[Umma]] (approximately 2100 BCE), and [[Egyptian\u2013Hittite peace treaty|an agreement]] between the Egyptian pharaoh [[Ramesses II|Ramses II]] and the Hittite king, [[\u1e2aattu\u0161ili III|Hattusilis III]], concluded in 1258 BCE. Interstate pacts and agreements of various kinds were also negotiated and concluded by [[Polity|polities]] across the world, from the eastern Mediterranean to East Asia.\n\n[[Ancient Greece]], which developed basic notions of governance and international relations, contributed to the formation of the international legal system; many of the [[List of ancient treaties|earliest peace treaties]] on record were concluded among the Greek city-states or with neighboring states. The [[Roman Empire]] established an early conceptual framework for international law, ''jus gentium'' (\"law of nations\"), which governed both the status of foreigners living in Rome and relations between foreigners and [[Roman citizenship|Roman citizens]]. Adopting the Greek concept of [[natural law]]\u2014<nowiki/>the idea that certain rights are inherent to all humans\u2014the Romans conceived of ''jus gentiumas'' as being universal. However, in contrast to modern international law, the Roman law of nations applied to relations with and between foreign individuals rather than among political units such as states.\n\nBeginning with the [[Spring and Autumn period]] of the eighth century BCE, China was divided into numerous [[ethnic Han]] states that were often at war with each other. Subsequently, there emerged rules for diplomacy and treaty-making, including notions regarding the just grounds for war, the rights of neutral parties, and the consolidation and partition of states; these concepts were sometimes applied to relations with [[Ethnic minorities in China|non-Han]] \"barbarians\" along China's western periphery.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=deLisle|first=Jacques|date=2000|title=China's Approach to International Law: A Historical Perspective|journal=Proceedings of the Annual Meeting (American Society of International Law)|volume=94|pages=267\u2013275|issn=0272-5037|jstor=25659409|doi=10.1017/S0272503700055956}}</ref> The subsequent [[Warring States period]] saw the development of two major schools of thought, [[Confucianism]] and [[Legalism (Chinese philosophy)|Legalism]], both of which held that the domestic and international legal spheres were closely interlinked, and sought to establish competing normative principles to guide foreign relations. Similarly, the [[Indian subcontinent]] was characterized by an ever-changing panoply of states, which over time developed rules of neutrality, treaty law, and international conduct. Embassies both temporary and permanent were established between states to maintain diplomatic relations, and relations were conducted with distant states in Europe and East Asia.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Alexander|first=C.

As in China and India, these divisions prompted the development of rules aimed at providing stable and predictable relations. Early examples include [[canon law]], which governed [[Ecclesiology|ecclesiastical]] institutions and clergy throughout Europe; the ''[[lex mercatoria]]''  (\"merchant law\"), which concerned trade and commerce; and various codes of [[maritime law]], such as the [[Rolls of Ol\u00e9ron]]\u2014<nowiki/>which drew from the ancient Roman [[Byzantine law#The Sea Laws|''Lex Rhodia'']]\u2014and the [[Laws of Wisbuy|Laws of Wisby]] (Visby), enacted among the commercial [[Hanseatic League]] of northern Europe and the Baltic region.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=hOVRAAAAcAAJ&pg=PA13|title=A Law Dictionary: Adapted to the Constitution and Laws of the United States of America, and of the Several States of the American Union : with References to the Civil and Other Systems of Foreign Law : to which is Added Kelham's Dictionary of the Norman and Old French Lanuage|last=Bouvier|first=John|date=1864|publisher=G.W.

The influx of [[Greek scholars in the Renaissance|Greek scholars]] from the [[Fall of byzantine empire|collapsing Byzantine Empire]], along with the introduction of the [[printing press]], spurred the [[Renaissance|development of science, humanism, and notions of individual rights]]. Increased [[Age of Discovery|navigation and exploration]] by Europeans challenged scholars to devise a conceptual framework for relations with different peoples and cultures. The formation of centralized states such as Spain and France brought more wealth, ambition, and trade, which in turn required increasingly more sophisticated rules and regulations.\n\nThe Italian peninsula, divided among various city-states with complex and often fractious relationships, was subsequently an early incubator of international law theory. Jurist and law professor [[Bartolus de Saxoferrato|Bartolus da Saxoferrato]] (1313\u20131357), who was well versed in Roman and Byzantine law, contributed to the increasingly relevant area of \"[[Conflict of laws|conflicts of law]]\", which concerns disputes between private individuals and entities in different sovereign jurisdictions; he is thus considered the founder of [[private international law]]. Another Italian jurist and law professor, [[Baldus de Ubaldis]] (1327\u20131400), provided voluminous commentaries and compilations of Roman, ecclesiastical, and [[feudal law]], thus creating an organized source of law that could be referenced by different nations. The most famous contributor from the region, [[Alberico Gentili]] (1552\u20131608), is considered a founder of international law, authoring one of the earliest works on the subject, ''De Legationibus Libri Tres'', in 1585. He wrote several more books on various issues in international law, notably ''De jure belli libri tres'' (''Three Books on the Law of War''), which provided comprehensive commentary on the laws of war and treaties,\n\nSpain, whose [[Spanish Empire|global empire]] spurred [[Spanish Golden Age|a golden age]] of economic and intellectual development in the 16th and 17th centuries, produced major contributors to international law. [[Francisco de Vitoria]] (1486\u20131546), who was concerned with the treatment of the indigenous peoples by Spain, invoked the law of nations as a basis for their innate dignity and rights, articulating an early version of sovereign equality between peoples. [[Francisco Su\u00e1rez]] (1548\u20131617) emphasized that international law was founded upon the law of nature.\n[[File:Grotius - De jure belli ac pacis, 1680 - 206.tif|thumb|Hugo Grotius' ''De jure belli ac pacis'', is considered one of the foundational texts of international law. (Pictured is the title page from the second edition of 1631).]]\nThe Dutch jurist [[Hugo Grotius]] (1583\u20131645) is widely regarded as the most seminal figure in international law, being one of the first scholars to articulate an international order that consists of a \"society of states\" governed not by [[force]] or [[warfare]] but by actual laws, mutual agreements, and customs.<ref>Hedley Bull; [[Adam Roberts (scholar)|Adam Roberts]]; Benedict Kingsbury) (eds.). ''Hugo Grotius and International Relations''. Oxford: Oxford UP. {{ISBN|978-0-19-825569-7}}.</ref> Grotius secularized international law and organized it into a comprehensive system; his 1625 work, ''[[De jure belli ac pacis|De Jure Belli ac Pacis]]'' (''On the Law of War and Peace''), laid down a system of [[Sources of international law|principles of natural law]] that bind all nations regardless of local custom or law. He also emphasized the [[Freedom of the seas|freedom of the high seas]], which was not only relevant to the growing number of European states exploring and colonising the world, but remains a cornerstone of international law today. Although the modern study of international law would not begin until the early 19th century, the 16th-century scholars Gentili, Vitoria and Grotius laid the foundations and are widely regarded as the \"fathers of international law.\"<ref name=\"Jr.20122\">{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=jYvmAgAAQBAJ|title=How the Catholic Church Built Western Civilization|author=Thomas Woods Jr.|date=18 September 2012|publisher=Regnery Publishing, Incorporated, An Eagle Publishing Company|isbn=978-1-59698-328-1|pages=5, 141\u2013142}}</ref>\n\nGrotius inspired two nascent schools of international law, the naturalists and the positivists. In the former camp was German jurist [[Samuel von Pufendorf]] (1632\u201394), who stressed the supremacy of the law of nature over states. His 1672 work, ''De iure naturae et gentium,'' expanded on the theories of Grotius and grounded natural law to [[reason]] and the secular world, asserting that it regulates only the external acts of states. Pufendorf challenged the [[Hobbesian|Hobbesian notion]] that the state of nature was one of war and conflict, arguing that the natural state of the world is actually peaceful but weak and uncertain without adherence to the law of nations. The actions of a state consist of nothing more than the sum of the individuals within that state, thereby requiring the state to apply a fundamental law of reason, which is the basis of natural law. He was among the earliest scholars to expand international law beyond European Christian nations, advocating for its application and recognition among all peoples on the basis of shared humanity.\n\nIn contrast, positivist writers, such as [[Richard Zouch]]e (1590\u20131661) in England and [[Cornelius van Bynkershoek|Cornelis van Bynkershoek]] (1673\u20131743) in the Netherlands, argued that international law should derive from the actual practice of states rather than Christian or Greco-Roman sources. The study of international law shifted away from its core concern on the law of war and towards the domains such as the law of the sea and commercial treaties. The positivist school made use of the new scientific method and was in that respect consistent with the empiricist and inductive approach to philosophy that was then gaining acceptance in Europe.\n\n==== Establishment of \"Westphalian system\" ====\n[[File:Alberico Gentili.jpg|right|thumb|[[Alberico Gentili|Sir Alberico Gentili]] is regarded as the Father of international law.<ref>{{cite book|title=How The Catholic Church Built Western Civilization|last=Woods|first=Thomas E.

The resulting \"[[Westphalian sovereignty]]\" established the current international legal order characterized by independent sovereign entities known as \"[[nation state]]s\", which have equality of sovereignty regardless of size and power, defined primarily by the inviolability of borders and non-interference in the domestic affairs of sovereign states. From this period onward, the concept of the sovereign nation-state evolved rapidly, and with it the development of complex relations that required predictable, widely accepted rules and guidelines. The idea of [[nationalism]], in which people began to see themselves as citizens of a particular group with a distinct national identity, further solidified the concept and formation of nation-states.\n\nElements of the naturalist and positivist schools became synthesised, most notably by German philosopher [[Christian Wolff (philosopher)|Christian Wolff]] (1679\u20131754) and Swiss jurist [[Emer de Vattel|Emerich de Vattel]] (1714\u201367), both of whom sought a middle-ground approach in international law. During the 18th century, the positivist tradition gained broader acceptance, although the concept of natural rights remained influential in international politics, particularly through the republican revolutions of the United States and France. Not until the 20th century would natural rights gain further salience in international law.\n\nSeveral legal systems developed in [[Europe]], including the codified systems of continental European states known as [[Civil law (legal system)|civil law]], and [[English common law]], which is based on decisions by judges and not by written codes. Other areas around the world developed differing legal systems, with the Chinese legal tradition dating back more than four thousand years, although at the end of the 19th century, there was still no written code for civil proceedings in China.<ref>''China and Her People'', [[Charles Harvey Denby|Charles Denby]], L. C. Page, Boston 1906 page 203</ref>\n\nUntil the mid-19th century, relations between states were dictated mostly by treaties, agreements between states to behave in a certain way, unenforceable except by force, and nonbinding except as matters of honor and faithfulness. One of the first instruments of modern international law was the [[Lieber Code]] of 1863, which governed the conduct of U.S. forces during the [[United States Civil War|U.S. Civil War]], and is considered to be the first written recitation of the rules and articles of war adhered to by all civilized nations. This led to the first prosecution for war crimes, in which a Confederate commandant was tried and hanged for holding prisoners of war in cruel and depraved conditions at [[Andersonville National Historic Site|Andersonville]], Georgia. In the years that followed, other states subscribed to limitations of their conduct, and numerous other treaties and bodies were created to regulate the conduct of states towards one another, including the [[Permanent Court of Arbitration]] in 1899, and the [[Hague Conventions (1899 and 1907)|Hague]] and [[Geneva Conventions]], the first of which was passed in 1864.[[File:Original Geneva Conventions.jpg|thumb|upright=1.05|The [[First Geneva Convention]] (1864) is one of the earliest formulations of international law|alt=|left]]\n\nThe concept of sovereignty was spread throughout the world by European powers, which had established colonies and spheres of influences over virtually every society. Positivism reached its peak in the late 19th century and its influence began to wane following the unprecedented bloodshed of the [[World War I|First World War]], which spurred the creation of international organisations such as the [[League of Nations]], founded in 1919 to safeguard peace and security. International law began to incorporate more naturalist notions such as [[Self-determination|self determination]] and [[human rights]]. The [[World War II|Second World War]] accelerated this development, leading to the establishment of the [[United Nations]], whose [[Charter of the United Nations|Charter]] enshrined principles such as nonaggression, nonintervention, and collective security. A more robust international legal order followed, which was buttressed by institutions such as the [[International Court of Justice]] and the [[United Nations Security Council]], and by multilateral agreements such as the [[Genocide Convention]]. The [[International Law Commission]] (ILC) was established in 1947 to help develop, codify, and strengthen international law\n\nHaving become geographically international through the colonial expansion of the European powers, international law became truly international in the 1960s and 1970s, when rapid [[Decolonization|decolonisation]] across the world resulted in the establishment of scores of newly independent states. The varying political and economic interests and needs of these states, along with their diverse cultural backgrounds, infused the hitherto European-dominated principles and practices of international law with new influences. A flurry of institutions, ranging from the [[World Health Organization|World Health Organisation]] to the [[World Trade Organization|World Trade Organisation]], furthered the development of a stable, predictable legal order with rules governing virtually every domain. The phenomenon of [[Globalization|globalisation]], which has led to the rapid integration of the world in economic, political, and even cultural terms, presents one of the greatest challenges to devising a truly international legal system.\n\n== Sources of International Law ==\n{{Main|Sources of international law|List of ICJ cases}}\nSources of international law have been influenced by a range of political and legal theories. During the 20th century, it was recognized by legal [[legal positivism|positivists]] that a [[sovereign state]] could limit its authority to act by consenting to an agreement according to the contract principle ''[[pacta sunt servanda]]''. This consensual view of international law was reflected in the 1920 Statute of the Permanent Court of International Justice, and remains preserved in Article 7 of the ICJ Statute.<ref>[https://www.un.org/en/documents/charter/index.shtml ''Charter of the United Nations''], United Nations, 24 October 1945, 1 UNTS, XVI</ref> The [[sources of international law]] applied by the community of nations are listed under Article 38 of the [[Statute of the International Court of Justice]], which is considered authoritative in this regard:\n\n# International treaties and conventions; \n# International custom as derived from the \"general practice\" of states; and\n# General legal principles \"recognized by civilized nations\".\n\nAdditionally, judicial decisions and the teachings of prominent international law scholars may be applied as \"subsidiary means for the determination of rules of law\".\n\nMany scholars agree that the fact that the sources are arranged sequentially suggests an implicit hierarchy of sources.<ref>{{cite book|title=Fundamental Perspectives on International Law|last=Slomanson|first=William|publisher=Wadsworth|year=2011|location=Boston, USA|pages=26\u201327}}</ref> However, the language of Article 38 does not explicitly hold such a hierarchy, and the decisions of the international courts and tribunals do not support such a strict hierarchy. By contrast, Article 21 of the [[Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court]] clearly defines a hierarchy of applicable law (or sources of international law).\n\n=== Treaties ===\nInternational treaty law comprises obligations expressly and voluntarily accepted by states between themselves in [[treaty|treaties]]. The [[Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties]] defines a treaty as follows<blockquote>''\u201ctreaty\u201d means an international agreement concluded between States in written form and  governed by international law, whether embodied in a single instrument or in two or more related instruments and whatever its particular designation\u201d''<ref>Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties, 1969, Article 2, 1(a)</ref></blockquote>This definition has led case-law to define a treaty as an international agreement that meets the following criteria: \n\n# Criterion 1: Requirement of an agreement, meetings of wills (''concours de volont\u00e9'')\n# Criterion 2: Requirement of being concluded between subjects of international law: this criterion excludes agreements signed between States and private corporations, such as [[Production sharing agreement|Production Sharing Agreements]]. In the 1952 ''[[United Kingdom v Iran]]'' case, the ICJ did not have jurisdiction for a dispute over the [[Anglo-Iranian Oil Company]] being nationalized as the dispute emerged from an alleged breach of contract between a private company and a State.\n# Criterion 3: Requirement to be governed by international law: any agreement governed by any domestic law will not be considered a treaty.\n# Criterion 4: No requirement of instrument: A treaty can be embodied in a single instrument or in two or more related instruments. This is best exemplified in exchange of letters - (''\u00e9change de lettres''). Per exemple, if France sends a letter to the United States to say, increase their contribution in the budget of the North Atlantic Alliance, and the US accepts the commitment, a treaty can be said to have emerged out of the exchange.\n# Criterion 5: No requirement of designation: the designation of the treaty, whether it is a \"convention\", \"pact\" or \"agreement\" has no impact on the qualification of said agreement as being a treaty.\n# Unwritten Criterion: requirement for the agreement to produce legal effects: this unwritten criterion is meant to exclude agreements which fulfill the above-listed conditions, but are not meant to produce legal effets, such as [[Memorandum of understanding|Memoranda of Understanding.]]\n\nWhere there are disputes about the exact meaning and application of national laws, it is the responsibility of the courts to decide what the law means. In international law, interpretation is within the domain of the states concerned, but may also be conferred on judicial bodies such as the International Court of Justice, by the terms of the treaties or by consent of the parties. Thus, while it is generally the responsibility of states to interpret the law for themselves, the processes of diplomacy and availability of supra-national judicial organs routinely provide assistance to that end.\n\nThe [[Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties]], which codifies several bedrock principles of treaty interpretation, holds that a treaty \"shall be interpreted in [[good faith]] in accordance with the ordinary meaning to be given to the terms of the treaty in their context and in the light of its object and purpose.\" This represents a compromise between three different theories of interpretation:\n\n* The '''textual approach,''' a restrictive interpretation that looks to the \"ordinary meaning\" of the text, assigning considerable weight to the actual text.\n* The '''subjective approach''', which takes into consideration factors such as the ideas behind the treaty, the context of the treaty's creation, and what the drafters intended.\n* The '''effective approach''', which interprets a treaty \"in the light of its object and purpose\", i.e. based on what best suits the goal of the treaty.\n\nThe foregoing are general rules of interpretation, and do no preclude the application of specific rules for particular areas of international law.\n\n*''[[Greece v United Kingdom]]'' [1952] [http://www.worldlii.org/int/cases/ICJ/1952/1.html ICJ 1], ICJ had no jurisdiction to hear a dispute between the UK government and a private Greek businessman under the terms of a treaty.\n*''[[United Kingdom v Iran]]'' [1952] [http://www.worldlii.org/int/cases/ICJ/1952/2.html ICJ 2], the ICJ did not have jurisdiction for a dispute over the [[Anglo-Iranian Oil Company]] being nationalized.\n*''[[Oil Platforms case]] (Islamic Republic of Iran v United States of America)'' [2003] [http://www.worldlii.org/int/cases/ICJ/2003/4.html ICJ 4], rejected dispute over damage to ships which hit a mine.\n\n=== International custom ===\nCustomary international law is derived from the consistent practice of States accompanied by ''[[opinio juris]]'', i.e. the conviction of states that the consistent practice is required by a legal obligation. Judgments of international tribunals as well as scholarly works have traditionally been looked to as persuasive sources for custom in addition to direct evidence of state behavior. Attempts to codify customary international law picked up momentum after the Second World War with the formation of the International Law Commission (ILC) under the aegis of the UN. Codified customary law is made the binding interpretation of the underlying custom by agreement through treaty. For states not party to such treaties, the work of the ILC may still be accepted as custom applying to those states. General principles of law are those commonly recognized by the major legal systems of the world. Certain norms of international law achieve the binding force of [[peremptory norm]]s (''jus cogens'') as to include all states with no permissible derogations.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.irwinlaw.com/cold/non-derogable_norm_of_international_law|title=Non-derogable norm of international law {{!}} Irwin Law|website=www.irwinlaw.com|access-date=2019-04-22}}</ref>\n\n*''[[Asylum case|Colombia v Per\u00fa]]''  (1950), recognizing custom as a source of international law, but a practice of giving asylum was not part of it.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.worldlii.org/int/cases/ICJ/1950/6.html|title=Colombia/Peru - Asylum - Judgment of 20 November 1950 - (including the declaration of Judge Zoricic) - Judgments [1950] ICJ 6; ICJ Reports 1950, p 266; [1950] ICJ Rep 266 (20 November 1950)|website=www.worldlii.org|access-date=2019-04-22}}</ref>\n*''[[Belgium v Spain]]'' (1970), finding that only the state where a corporation is incorporated (not where its major shareholders reside) has standing to bring an action for damages for economic loss.\n\n=== Statehood and responsibility ===\n{{See also|Monism and dualism in international law}}\nInternational law establishes the framework and the criteria for identifying [[Sovereign state|states]] as the principal actors in the international legal system. As the existence of a state presupposes control and [[jurisdiction]] over territory, international law deals with the acquisition of territory, [[state immunity]] and the legal responsibility of states in their conduct with each other. International law is similarly concerned with the treatment of individuals within state boundaries. There is thus a comprehensive regime dealing with group rights, the treatment of [[alien (law)|aliens]], the rights of [[refugee]]s, [[Transnational crime|international crimes]], [[nationality]] problems, and [[human rights]] generally. It further includes the important functions of the maintenance of international peace and security, arms control, the pacific settlement of disputes and the regulation of the [[use of force]] in international relations. Even when the law is not able to stop the outbreak of war, it has developed principles to govern the conduct of hostilities and the treatment of [[prisoners of war|prisoners]]. International law is also used to govern issues relating to the global environment, the global commons such as [[international waters]] and [[outer space]], global communications, and [[International trade|world trade]].\n\nIn theory all states are [[Sovereignty|sovereign]] and equal. As a result of the notion of sovereignty, the value and authority of international law is dependent upon the voluntary participation of states in its formulation, observance, and enforcement. Although there may be exceptions, it is thought by many international academics that most states enter into legal commitments with other states out of [[enlightened self-interest]] rather than adherence to a body of law that is higher than their own. As [[D. W. Greig]] notes, \"international law cannot exist in isolation from the political factors operating in the sphere of [[international relations]]\".<ref>Greig, D. W., ''International Law'', 2nd edn (Butterworths: London, 1976)</ref>\n\nTraditionally, [[sovereign state]]s and the [[Holy See#Status of the Holy See in international law|Holy See]] were the sole subjects of international law. With the proliferation of [[international organizations]] over the last century, they have in some cases been recognized as relevant parties as well. Recent interpretations of [[international human rights law]], [[international humanitarian law]], and [[international trade law]] (e.g., [[North American Free Trade Agreement]] (NAFTA) Chapter 11 actions) have been inclusive of corporations, and even of certain individuals.\n\nThe conflict between international law and national sovereignty is subject to vigorous debate and dispute in academia, diplomacy, and politics. Certainly, there is a growing trend toward judging a state's domestic actions in the light of international law and standards. Numerous people now view the nation-state as the primary unit of international affairs, and believe that only states may choose to voluntarily enter into commitments under international law, and that they have the right to follow their own counsel when it comes to interpretation of their commitments. Certain scholars{{who|date=August 2012}} and political leaders feel that these modern developments endanger nation states by taking power away from state governments and ceding it to international bodies such as the U.N. and the World Bank, argue that international law has evolved to a point where it exists separately from the mere consent of states, and discern a legislative and judicial process to international law that parallels such processes within domestic law.  This especially occurs when states violate or deviate from the expected standards of conduct adhered to by all civilized nations.\n\nA number of states place emphasis on the principle of territorial sovereignty, thus seeing states as having free rein over their internal affairs. Other states oppose this view. One group of opponents of this point of view, including many [[Europe]]an nations, maintain that all civilized nations have certain norms of conduct expected of them, including the prohibition of [[genocide]], [[slavery]] and the [[slave trade]], [[war of aggression|wars of aggression]], [[torture]], and [[piracy]], and that violation of these universal norms represents a crime, not only against the individual victims, but against humanity as a whole. States and individuals who subscribe to this view opine that, in the case of the individual responsible for violation of international law, he \"is become, like the [[piracy|pirate]] and the [[slave trade]]r before him, ''[[hostis humani generis]]'', an enemy of all mankind\",<ref>Janis, M. and Noyes, J. International Law\": Cases and Commentary (3rd ed.), Prosecutor v. Furund\u017eija, Page 148 (2006)</ref> and thus subject to prosecution in a fair trial before any fundamentally just tribunal, through the exercise of [[universal jurisdiction]].\n\nThough the European democracies tend to support broad, universalistic interpretations of international law, many other democracies have differing views on international law. Several democracies, including [[India]], [[Israel]] and the [[United States]], take a flexible, eclectic approach, recognizing aspects of international law such as territorial rights as universal, regarding other aspects as arising from treaty or custom, and viewing certain aspects as not being subjects of international law at all. Democracies in the developing world, due to their past colonial histories, often insist on non-interference in their internal affairs, particularly regarding human rights standards or their peculiar institutions, but often strongly support international law at the bilateral and multilateral levels, such as in the United Nations, and especially regarding the use of force, disarmament obligations, and the terms of the UN Charter.\n\n*''[[Case Concerning United States Diplomatic and Consular Staff in Tehran]]'' [1980] [http://www.worldlii.org/int/cases/ICJ/1980/1.html ICJ 1]\n*''[[Democratic Republic of the Congo v Belgium]]'' [2002] [http://www.worldlii.org/int/cases/ICJ/2002/1.html ICJ 1]\n\n=== Territory and the sea ===\n{{Main|Law of the Sea}}The law of the sea is the area of international law concerning the principles and rules by which states and other entities interact in maritime matters.<ref>James Harrison, ''Making the Law of the Sea: A Study in the Development of International Law'' (2011), p. 1. {{verify source |date=August 2019 |reason=This ref was deleted ([[Special:Diff/903683450]]) by a bug in VisualEditor and later restored by a bot from the original cite at [[Special:Permalink/899677351]] cite #1 - please verify the cite's accuracy and remove this {verify source} template.

However, there are means by which breaches are brought to the attention of the international community and some means for resolution. For example, there are judicial or quasi-judicial tribunals in international law in certain areas such as trade and human rights. The formation of the [[United Nations]], for example, created a means for the world community to enforce international law upon members that violate its charter through the Security Council.\n\nSince international law exists in a legal environment without an overarching \"sovereign\" (i.e., an external power able and willing to compel compliance with international norms), \"enforcement\" of international law is very different from in the domestic context. In many cases, enforcement takes on [[Ronald Coase|Coasian]] characteristics, where the norm is self-enforcing.  In other cases, defection from the norm can pose a real risk, particularly if the international environment is changing.  When this happens, and if enough states (or enough powerful states) continually ignore a particular aspect of international law, the norm may actually change according to concepts of customary international law.  For example, prior to World War I, [[unrestricted submarine warfare]] was considered a violation of international law and ostensibly the [[casus belli]] for the United States' declaration of war against Germany.  By World War II, however, the practice was so widespread that during the [[Nuremberg trials]], the charges against German Admiral [[Karl D\u00f6nitz]] for ordering unrestricted submarine warfare were dropped, notwithstanding that the activity constituted a clear violation of the Second London Naval Treaty of 1936.\n\n=== Domestic enforcement ===\nApart from a state's natural inclination to uphold certain norms, the force of international law comes from the pressure that states put upon one another to behave consistently and to honor their obligations. As with any system of law, many violations of international law obligations are overlooked. If addressed, it may be through [[diplomacy]] and the consequences upon an offending state's reputation, submission to international judicial determination,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.icj-cij.org/homepage/index.php|title=Home \u2013 International Court of Justice|publisher=|accessdate=17 August 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130627014957/http://www.icj-cij.org/homepage/index.php|archive-date=27 June 2013|url-status=dead}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.icj-cij.org/docket/index.php?p1=3&p2=3&k=cd&case=1|title=Contentious Cases \u2013 International Court of Justice|publisher=|accessdate=17 August 2015}}</ref> arbitration,<ref>{{cite journal|jstor=2194880|title=Arbitral Opinion Relative to the Gold of the National Bank of Albania|date=1 January 1955|journal=The American Journal of International Law|volume=49|issue=3|pages=403\u2013405|doi=10.2307/2194880}}</ref> sanctions<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.treasury.gov/resource-center/sanctions/Programs/pages/syria.aspx|title=Syria Sanctions|website=Treasury.gov|accessdate=17 August 2015}}</ref> or force including war.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.falklandswar.org.uk|title=The Falklands Conflict|website=Falkslandswar.org.uk|accessdate=17 August 2015}}</ref> Though violations may be common in fact, states try to avoid the appearance of having disregarded international obligations. States may also unilaterally adopt sanctions against one another such as the severance of economic or diplomatic ties, or through reciprocal action. In some cases, domestic courts may render judgment against a foreign state (the realm of private international law) for an injury, though this is a complicated area of law where international law intersects with domestic law.\n\nIt is implicit in the Westphalian system of nation-states, and explicitly recognized under Article 51 of the [[Charter of the United Nations]], that all states have the inherent right to individual and collective self-defense if an armed attack occurs against them. Article 51 of the UN Charter guarantees the right of states to defend themselves until (and unless) the Security Council takes measures to keep the peace.\n\n===International bodies===\n{{Main|International legal system|United Nations General Assembly Resolution 377}}\nAs a \"deliberative, policymaking and representative organ\", the [[United Nations General Assembly]] \"is empowered to make recommendations\"; it can neither codify international law nor make binding resolutions.<ref name=\"UN_GA-Powers\">{{cite web |title=Functions and powers of the General Assembly |url=http://www.un.org/en/ga/about/background.shtml |website=un.org |publisher=United Nations |accessdate=5 October 2018}}</ref><ref name=\"UN_Int-Law\">{{cite web |title=International Law and Justice |url=http://www.un.org/en/sections/issues-depth/international-law-and-justice/index.html |website=un.org |publisher=United Nations |accessdate=5 October 2018|date=2016-08-30 }}</ref> Merely internal resolutions, such as budgetary matters, may be binding on the operation of the General Assembly itself. Violations of the UN Charter by members of the United Nations may be raised by the aggrieved state in the General Assembly for debate.\n\n[[United Nations General Assembly resolution|General Assembly resolution]]s are generally non-binding towards member states, but through its adoption of the [[United Nations General Assembly Resolution 377|\"Uniting for Peace\" resolution (A/RES/377 A)]], of 3 November 1950, the Assembly declared that it had the power to authorize the use of force, under the terms of the UN Charter, in cases of breaches of the peace or acts of aggression, provided that the Security Council, owing to the negative vote of a permanent member, fails to act to address the situation. The Assembly also declared, by its adoption of [[United Nations General Assembly Resolution 377|resolution 377 A]], that it could call for other collective measures\u2014such as economic and diplomatic sanctions\u2014in situations constituting the milder \"threat to the Peace\".\n\nThe Uniting for Peace resolution was initiated by the United States in 1950, shortly after the outbreak of the [[Korean War]], as a means of circumventing possible future Soviet vetoes in the [[United Nations Security Council|Security Council]]. The legal role of the resolution is clear, given that the General Assembly can neither issue binding resolutions nor codify law. It was never argued by the \"Joint Seven-Powers\" that put forward the draft resolution,<ref>United States, United Kingdom, France, Canada, Turkey, Philippines and Uruguay</ref> during the corresponding discussions, that it in any way afforded the Assembly new powers. Instead, they argued that the resolution simply declared what the Assembly's powers already were, according to the UN Charter, in the case of a dead-locked Security Council.<ref name=\"UN_APV299\">{{UN document |docid=A-PV.299 |type=Proces Verbal |body=General Assembly |session=5 |year=1950 |date=1 November 1950 |accessdate=2008-04-13}}</ref><ref name=\"UN_APV300\">{{UN document |docid=A-PV.300 |type=Proces Verbal |body=General Assembly |session=5 |year=1950 |date=2 November 1950 |accessdate=2008-04-13}}</ref><ref name=\"UN_APV301\">{{UN document |docid=A-PV.301 |type=Proces Verbal |body=General Assembly |session=5 |year=1950 |date=2 November 1950 |accessdate=2008-04-13}}</ref><ref name=\"UN_APV302\">{{UN document |docid=A-PV.302 |type=Proces Verbal |body=General Assembly |session=5 |year=1950 |date=3 November 1950 |accessdate=2008-04-13}}</ref> The Soviet Union was the only permanent member of the Security Council to vote against the Charter interpretations that were made recommendation by the Assembly's adoption of resolution 377 A.\n\nAlleged violations of the Charter can also be raised by states in the Security Council. The Security Council could subsequently pass resolutions under Chapter VI of the UN Charter to recommend the \"Pacific Resolution of Disputes.\" Such resolutions are not binding under international law, though they usually are expressive of the Council's convictions.  In rare cases, the Security Council can adopt resolutions under Chapter VII of the UN Charter, related to \"threats to Peace, Breaches of the Peace and Acts of Aggression,\" which are legally binding under international law, and can be followed up with economic sanctions, military action, and similar uses of force through the auspices of the United Nations.\n\nIt has been argued that resolutions passed outside of Chapter VII can also be binding; the legal basis for that is the Council's broad powers under Article 24(2), which states that \"in discharging these duties (exercise of primary responsibility in international peace and security), it shall act in accordance with the Purposes and Principles of the United Nations\". The mandatory nature of such resolutions was upheld by the [[International Court of Justice]]  (ICJ) in its advisory opinion on [[Namibia]]. The binding nature of such resolutions can be deduced from an interpretation of their language and intent.\n\nStates can also, upon mutual consent, submit disputes for arbitration by the [[International Court of Justice]], located in [[The Hague]], [[Netherlands]]. The judgments given by the Court in these cases are binding, although it possesses no means to enforce its rulings.\nThe Court may give an advisory opinion on any legal question at the request of whatever body may be authorized by or in accordance with the Charter of the United Nations to make such a request. Some of the advisory cases brought before the court have been controversial with respect to the court's competence and jurisdiction.\n\nOften enormously complicated matters, ICJ cases (of which there have been less than 150 since the court was created from the [[Permanent Court of International Justice]] in 1945) can stretch on for years and generally involve thousands of pages of pleadings, evidence, and the world's leading specialist international lawyers. As of November 2019, there are 16 cases pending at the ICJ. Decisions made through other means of arbitration may be binding or non-binding depending on the nature of the arbitration agreement, whereas decisions resulting from contentious cases argued before the ICJ are always binding on the involved states.\n\nThough states (or increasingly, [[international organizations]]) are usually the only ones with standing to address a violation of international law, some treaties, such as the [[International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights]] have an optional [[Protocol (treaty)|protocol]] that allows individuals who have had their rights violated by member states to petition the international [[Human Rights Committee]].

Others are: the United Nations [[International Court of Justice]], and the [[International Criminal Court]] (when national systems have totally failed and the [[Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court|Treaty of Rome]] is applicable) and the [[Court of Arbitration for Sport]].\n\n===East African Community===\n{{Main|East African Community}}\nThere were ambitions to make the East African Community, consisting of [[Kenya]], [[Tanzania]], [[Uganda]], [[Burundi]] and [[Rwanda]], a political federation with its own form of binding supranational law, but this effort has not materialized.\n\n===Union of South American Nations===\n{{Main|Union of South American Nations}}\nThe Union of South American Nations serves the South American continent. It intends to establish a framework akin to the [[European Union]] by the end of 2019. It is envisaged to have its own passport and currency, and limit barriers to trade.\n\n===Andean Community of Nations===\n{{Main|Andean Community of Nations}}\nThe Andean Community of Nations is the first attempt to integrate the countries of the [[Andes Mountains]] in South America. It started with the Cartagena Agreement of 26 May 1969, and consists of four countries: [[Bolivia]], [[Colombia]], [[Ecuador]] and [[Peru]]. The Andean Community follows supranational laws, called Agreements, which are mandatory for these countries.\n\n==International legal theory==\n{{Main|International legal theories}}\nInternational legal theory comprises a variety of theoretical and methodological approaches used to explain and analyse the content, formation and effectiveness of international law and institutions and to suggest improvements. Some approaches center on the question of compliance: why states follow international norms in the absence of a coercive power that ensures compliance. Other approaches focus on the problem of the formation of international rules: why states voluntarily adopt international law norms, that limit their freedom of action, in the absence of a world legislature; while other perspectives are policy oriented: they elaborate theoretical frameworks and instruments to criticize the existing norms and to make suggestions on how to improve them. Some of these approaches are based on domestic [[legal theory]], some are [[interdisciplinary]], and others have been developed expressly to analyse international law. Classical approaches to International legal theory are the [[Natural law]], the Eclectic and the [[Legal positivism]] schools of thought.\n\nThe [[natural law]] approach argues that international norms should be based on [[axiomatic]] truths. 16th-century natural law writer, [[Francisco de Vitoria]], a professor of [[theology]] at the [[University of Salamanca]], examined the questions of the [[just war]], the Spanish authority in the [[Americas]], and the rights of the Native American peoples.\n\nIn 1625 [[Hugo Grotius]] argued that nations as well as persons ought to be governed by universal principle based on [[morality]] and [[Divine retribution|divine justice]] while the relations among polities ought to be governed by the law of peoples, the ''[[jus gentium]]'', established by the consent of the community of nations on the basis of the principle of ''[[pacta sunt servanda]]'', that is, on the basis of the observance of commitments. On his part, [[Emmerich de Vattel]] argued instead for the equality of states as articulated by 18th-century natural law and suggested that the law of nations was composed of custom and law on the one hand, and natural law on the other. During the 17th century, the basic tenets of the Grotian or [[Eclecticism|eclectic]] school, especially the doctrines of legal equality, [[territorial sovereignty]], and independence of states, became the fundamental principles of the European political and legal system and were enshrined in the 1648 [[Peace of Westphalia]].\n\nThe early [[legal positivism|positivist]] school emphasized the importance of custom and treaties as sources of international law. 16th-century [[Alberico Gentili]] used historical examples to posit that positive law (''jus voluntarium'') was determined by general consent. [[Cornelius van Bynkershoek]] asserted that the bases of international law were customs and treaties commonly consented to by various states, while [[John Jacob Moser]] emphasized the importance of state practice in international law. The positivism school narrowed the range of international practice that might qualify as law, favouring [[rationality]] over [[morality]] and [[ethic]]s. The 1815 [[Congress of Vienna]] marked the formal recognition of the political and international legal system based on the conditions of Europe.\n\nModern legal positivists consider international law as a unified system of rules that emanates from the states' will. International law, as it is, is an \"[[Objectivity (philosophy)|objective]]\" reality that needs to be distinguished from law \"as it should be.\" Classic positivism demands rigorous tests for [[law|legal]] [[Validity (logic)|validity]] and it deems irrelevant all extralegal arguments.<ref>[[Bruno Simma]] and Andreas L.Paulus \"Symposium on method in International Law: The Responsibility of Individuals for Human Rights Abuses in Internal Conflicts: A Positivist View\" 93 American Journal of International Law 302  (April, 1999)</ref>\n\n== Criticisms ==\nNation-states observe the principle of {{lang-la|[[par in parem non habet imperium]]|lit=Between equals there is no sovereign power|label=none}}. [[John Austin (legal philosopher)|John Austin]] therefore asserted that 'so-called' international law, lacking a sovereign power and so unenforceable, was not really law at all, but 'positive morality', consisting of 'opinions and sentiments...more ethical than legal in nature.'<ref name=\"auto\">James B Scott, \"The legal nature of international law\", ''[[Columbia Law Review]]'', vol 5 no 2, Feb 1905, p 128-30</ref>\n\nArticle 2 (1) of the [[UN Charter]] confirms this Sovereignty of Nations; no state is in subjection to any other state.\n\nAlso, since the bulk of international law is treaty law, binding only on signatories, then; <blockquote> 'If legislation is the making of laws by a person or assembly binding on the whole community, there is no such thing as international law. For treaties bind only those who sign them.' </blockquote>\nSince states are few in number, diverse and atypical in character, unindictable, lacking a centralised sovereign power, and their agreements unpoliced and decentralised,<ref name=\"auto2\">Wight, power politics, p 109</ref> then, says Wight, 'international society is not a society at all. The condition of international relations is best described as international anarchy;\n<blockquote> 'While in domestic politics the struggle for power is governed and circumscribed by law, in international politics, law is governed and circumscribed by the struggle for power. (This is why) international politics is called [[power politics]]... War is the only means by which states can in the last resort defend vital interests...the causes of war are inherent in power politics.' </blockquote>\n\nOn the subject of treaty law, [[Charles de Gaulle]] said this; 'Treaties are like pretty girls, or roses; they last only as long as they last.'<ref name=\"auto3\">speech, 2/7/1963; [[Oxford Dictionary of Quotations]], OUP 1999, p. 255</ref>\n\nFor [[Hans Morgenthau]], international law is the weakest and most primitive system of law enforcement. Its decentralised nature makes it similar to the law that prevails in preliterate tribal societies.<ref name=\"auto4\">Morgenthau, Politics among nations, fifth edition, Knopf, 1976, p273</ref> A [[monopoly on violence]] is what makes domestic law enforceable; but between nations, there are multiple competing sources of force.<ref name=\"auto5\">ibid, p273-4</ref> The confusion created by treaty laws, which resemble private contracts between persons, is mitigated only by the relatively small number of states.<ref name=\"auto6\">ibid, p 275</ref> On the vital subject of war, it is unclear whether the [[Nuremberg trials]] created new law, or applied the existing law of the [[Kellogg-Briand pact]].\n\nMorgenthau asserts that no state may be compelled to submit a dispute to an international tribunal, making laws unenforceable and voluntary.<ref name=\"auto8\">ibid, p281</ref> International law is also unpoliced, lacking agencies for enforcement.<ref name=\"auto9\">ibid, p 289</ref> He cites a 1947 US opinion poll in which 75% of respondents wanted 'an international police to maintain world peace'; but only 13% wanted that force to exceed the US armed forces.

Consequently, states may choose to not abide by international law, and even to break a treaty.<ref>{{cite book|title=Fundamental Perspectives on International Law|last=Slomanson|first=William|publisher=Wadsworth|year=2011|location=Boston, USA|pages=4}}</ref> However, such violations, particularly of customary international law and peremptory norms (''[[Peremptory norm|jus cogens]]''), can be met with coercive action, ranging from military intervention to diplomatic and economic pressure.\n\nThe [[Monism and dualism in international law|relationship and interaction]] between a national legal system ([[municipal law]]) and international law is complex and variable. National law may become international law when treaties permit national jurisdiction to [[supranational union|supranational]] tribunals such as the [[European Court of Human Rights]] or the [[International Criminal Court]].

Among the earliest examples are peace treaties between the [[Mesopotamia]]n city-states of [[Lagash]] and [[Umma]] (approximately 2100 BCE), and [[Egyptian\u2013Hittite peace treaty|an agreement]] between the Egyptian pharaoh [[Ramesses II|Ramses II]] and the Hittite king, [[\u1e2aattu\u0161ili III|Hattusilis III]], concluded in 1258 BCE. Interstate pacts and agreements of various kinds were also negotiated and concluded by [[Polity|polities]] across the world, from the eastern Mediterranean to East Asia.\n\n[[Ancient Greece]], which developed basic notions of governance and international relations, contributed to the formation of the international legal system; many of the [[List of ancient treaties|earliest peace treaties]] on record were concluded among the Greek city-states or with neighboring states. The [[Roman Empire]] established an early conceptual framework for international law, ''jus gentium'' (\"law of nations\"), which governed both the status of foreigners living in Rome and relations between foreigners and [[Roman citizenship|Roman citizens]]. Adopting the Greek concept of [[natural law]]\u2014<nowiki/>the idea that certain rights are inherent to all humans\u2014the Romans conceived of ''jus gentiumas'' as being universal. However, in contrast to modern international law, the Roman law of nations applied to relations with and between foreign individuals rather than among political units such as states.\n\nBeginning with the [[Spring and Autumn period]] of the eighth century BCE, China was divided into numerous [[ethnic Han]] states that were often at war with each other. Subsequently, there emerged rules for diplomacy and treaty-making, including notions regarding the just grounds for war, the rights of neutral parties, and the consolidation and partition of states; these concepts were sometimes applied to relations with [[Ethnic minorities in China|non-Han]] \"barbarians\" along China's western periphery.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=deLisle|first=Jacques|date=2000|title=China's Approach to International Law: A Historical Perspective|journal=Proceedings of the Annual Meeting (American Society of International Law)|volume=94|pages=267\u2013275|issn=0272-5037|jstor=25659409|doi=10.1017/S0272503700055956}}</ref> The subsequent [[Warring States period]] saw the development of two major schools of thought, [[Confucianism]] and [[Legalism (Chinese philosophy)|Legalism]], both of which held that the domestic and international legal spheres were closely interlinked, and sought to establish competing normative principles to guide foreign relations. Similarly, the [[Indian subcontinent]] was characterized by an ever-changing panoply of states, which over time developed rules of neutrality, treaty law, and international conduct.

The influx of [[Greek scholars in the Renaissance|Greek scholars]] from the [[Fall of byzantine empire|collapsing Byzantine Empire]], along with the introduction of the [[printing press]], spurred the [[Renaissance|development of science, humanism, and notions of individual rights]]. Increased [[Age of Discovery|navigation and exploration]] by Europeans challenged scholars to devise a conceptual framework for relations with different peoples and cultures. The formation of centralized states such as Spain and France brought more wealth, ambition, and trade, which in turn required increasingly more sophisticated rules and regulations.\n\nThe Italian peninsula, divided among various city-states with complex and often fractious relationships, was subsequently an early incubator of international law theory. Jurist and law professor [[Bartolus de Saxoferrato|Bartolus da Saxoferrato]] (1313\u20131357), who was well versed in Roman and Byzantine law, contributed to the increasingly relevant area of \"[[Conflict of laws|conflicts of law]]\", which concerns disputes between private individuals and entities in different sovereign jurisdictions; he is thus considered the founder of [[private international law]]. Another Italian jurist and law professor, [[Baldus de Ubaldis]] (1327\u20131400), provided voluminous commentaries and compilations of Roman, ecclesiastical, and [[feudal law]], thus creating an organized source of law that could be referenced by different nations. The most famous contributor from the region, [[Alberico Gentili]] (1552\u20131608), is considered a founder of international law, authoring one of the earliest works on the subject, ''De Legationibus Libri Tres'', in 1585. He wrote several more books on various issues in international law, notably ''De jure belli libri tres'' (''Three Books on the Law of War''), which provided comprehensive commentary on the laws of war and treaties,\n\nSpain, whose [[Spanish Empire|global empire]] spurred [[Spanish Golden Age|a golden age]] of economic and intellectual development in the 16th and 17th centuries, produced major contributors to international law. [[Francisco de Vitoria]] (1486\u20131546), who was concerned with the treatment of the indigenous peoples by Spain, invoked the law of nations as a basis for their innate dignity and rights, articulating an early version of sovereign equality between peoples. [[Francisco Su\u00e1rez]] (1548\u20131617) emphasized that international law was founded upon the law of nature.\n[[File:Grotius - De jure belli ac pacis, 1680 - 206.tif|thumb|Hugo Grotius' ''De jure belli ac pacis'', is considered one of the foundational texts of international law. (Pictured is the title page from the second edition of 1631).]]\nThe Dutch jurist [[Hugo Grotius]] (1583\u20131645) is widely regarded as the most seminal figure in international law, being one of the first scholars to articulate an international order that consists of a \"society of states\" governed not by [[force]] or [[warfare]] but by actual laws, mutual agreements, and customs.<ref>Hedley Bull; [[Adam Roberts (scholar)|Adam Roberts]]; Benedict Kingsbury) (eds.). ''Hugo Grotius and International Relations''. Oxford: Oxford UP. {{ISBN|978-0-19-825569-7}}.</ref> Grotius secularized international law and organized it into a comprehensive system; his 1625 work, ''[[De jure belli ac pacis|De Jure Belli ac Pacis]]'' (''On the Law of War and Peace''), laid down a system of [[Sources of international law|principles of natural law]] that bind all nations regardless of local custom or law. He also emphasized the [[Freedom of the seas|freedom of the high seas]], which was not only relevant to the growing number of European states exploring and colonising the world, but remains a cornerstone of international law today. Although the modern study of international law would not begin until the early 19th century, the 16th-century scholars Gentili, Vitoria and Grotius laid the foundations and are widely regarded as the \"fathers of international law.\"<ref name=\"Jr.20122\">{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=jYvmAgAAQBAJ|title=How the Catholic Church Built Western Civilization|author=Thomas Woods Jr.|date=18 September 2012|publisher=Regnery Publishing, Incorporated, An Eagle Publishing Company|isbn=978-1-59698-328-1|pages=5, 141\u2013142}}</ref>\n\nGrotius inspired two nascent schools of international law, the naturalists and the positivists. In the former camp was German jurist [[Samuel von Pufendorf]] (1632\u201394), who stressed the supremacy of the law of nature over states. His 1672 work, ''De iure naturae et gentium,'' expanded on the theories of Grotius and grounded natural law to [[reason]] and the secular world, asserting that it regulates only the external acts of states. Pufendorf challenged the [[Hobbesian|Hobbesian notion]] that the state of nature was one of war and conflict, arguing that the natural state of the world is actually peaceful but weak and uncertain without adherence to the law of nations. The actions of a state consist of nothing more than the sum of the individuals within that state, thereby requiring the state to apply a fundamental law of reason, which is the basis of natural law. He was among the earliest scholars to expand international law beyond European Christian nations, advocating for its application and recognition among all peoples on the basis of shared humanity.\n\nIn contrast, positivist writers, such as [[Richard Zouch]]e (1590\u20131661) in England and [[Cornelius van Bynkershoek|Cornelis van Bynkershoek]] (1673\u20131743) in the Netherlands, argued that international law should derive from the actual practice of states rather than Christian or Greco-Roman sources. The study of international law shifted away from its core concern on the law of war and towards the domains such as the law of the sea and commercial treaties. The positivist school made use of the new scientific method and was in that respect consistent with the empiricist and inductive approach to philosophy that was then gaining acceptance in Europe.\n\n==== Establishment of \"Westphalian system\" ====\n[[File:Alberico Gentili.jpg|right|thumb|[[Alberico Gentili|Sir Alberico Gentili]] is regarded as the Father of international law.<ref>{{cite book|title=How The Catholic Church Built Western Civilization|last=Woods|first=Thomas E. (Jr.)|publisher=Regnery Publishing|year=2005|isbn=978-0-89526-038-3|location=Washington, DC|url-access=registration|url=https://archive.org/details/howcatholicchurc0000wood}}</ref>]]\nThe developments of the 16th century came to a head at the conclusion of the \"[[Peace of Westphalia]]\" in 1648, which is considered to be the seminal event in international law. The resulting \"[[Westphalian sovereignty]]\" established the current international legal order characterized by independent sovereign entities known as \"[[nation state]]s\", which have equality of sovereignty regardless of size and power, defined primarily by the inviolability of borders and non-interference in the domestic affairs of sovereign states. From this period onward, the concept of the sovereign nation-state evolved rapidly, and with it the development of complex relations that required predictable, widely accepted rules and guidelines. The idea of [[nationalism]], in which people began to see themselves as citizens of a particular group with a distinct national identity, further solidified the concept and formation of nation-states.\n\nElements of the naturalist and positivist schools became synthesised, most notably by German philosopher [[Christian Wolff (philosopher)|Christian Wolff]] (1679\u20131754) and Swiss jurist [[Emer de Vattel|Emerich de Vattel]] (1714\u201367), both of whom sought a middle-ground approach in international law. During the 18th century, the positivist tradition gained broader acceptance, although the concept of natural rights remained influential in international politics, particularly through the republican revolutions of the United States and France. Not until the 20th century would natural rights gain further salience in international law.\n\nSeveral legal systems developed in [[Europe]], including the codified systems of continental European states known as [[Civil law (legal system)|civil law]], and [[English common law]], which is based on decisions by judges and not by written codes. Other areas around the world developed differing legal systems, with the Chinese legal tradition dating back more than four thousand years, although at the end of the 19th century, there was still no written code for civil proceedings in China.<ref>''China and Her People'', [[Charles Harvey Denby|Charles Denby]], L. C. Page, Boston 1906 page 203</ref>\n\nUntil the mid-19th century, relations between states were dictated mostly by treaties, agreements between states to behave in a certain way, unenforceable except by force, and nonbinding except as matters of honor and faithfulness. One of the first instruments of modern international law was the [[Lieber Code]] of 1863, which governed the conduct of U.S. forces during the [[United States Civil War|U.S. Civil War]], and is considered to be the first written recitation of the rules and articles of war adhered to by all civilized nations. This led to the first prosecution for war crimes, in which a Confederate commandant was tried and hanged for holding prisoners of war in cruel and depraved conditions at [[Andersonville National Historic Site|Andersonville]], Georgia. In the years that followed, other states subscribed to limitations of their conduct, and numerous other treaties and bodies were created to regulate the conduct of states towards one another, including the [[Permanent Court of Arbitration]] in 1899, and the [[Hague Conventions (1899 and 1907)|Hague]] and [[Geneva Conventions]], the first of which was passed in 1864.[[File:Original Geneva Conventions.jpg|thumb|upright=1.05|The [[First Geneva Convention]] (1864) is one of the earliest formulations of international law|alt=|left]]\n\nThe concept of sovereignty was spread throughout the world by European powers, which had established colonies and spheres of influences over virtually every society. Positivism reached its peak in the late 19th century and its influence began to wane following the unprecedented bloodshed of the [[World War I|First World War]], which spurred the creation of international organisations such as the [[League of Nations]], founded in 1919 to safeguard peace and security. International law began to incorporate more naturalist notions such as [[Self-determination|self determination]] and [[human rights]]. The [[World War II|Second World War]] accelerated this development, leading to the establishment of the [[United Nations]], whose [[Charter of the United Nations|Charter]] enshrined principles such as nonaggression, nonintervention, and collective security. A more robust international legal order followed, which was buttressed by institutions such as the [[International Court of Justice]] and the [[United Nations Security Council]], and by multilateral agreements such as the [[Genocide Convention]]. The [[International Law Commission]] (ILC) was established in 1947 to help develop, codify, and strengthen international law\n\nHaving become geographically international through the colonial expansion of the European powers, international law became truly international in the 1960s and 1970s, when rapid [[Decolonization|decolonisation]] across the world resulted in the establishment of scores of newly independent states. The varying political and economic interests and needs of these states, along with their diverse cultural backgrounds, infused the hitherto European-dominated principles and practices of international law with new influences. A flurry of institutions, ranging from the [[World Health Organization|World Health Organisation]] to the [[World Trade Organization|World Trade Organisation]], furthered the development of a stable, predictable legal order with rules governing virtually every domain. The phenomenon of [[Globalization|globalisation]], which has led to the rapid integration of the world in economic, political, and even cultural terms, presents one of the greatest challenges to devising a truly international legal system.\n\n== Sources of International Law ==\n{{Main|Sources of international law|List of ICJ cases}}\nSources of international law have been influenced by a range of political and legal theories. During the 20th century, it was recognized by legal [[legal positivism|positivists]] that a [[sovereign state]] could limit its authority to act by consenting to an agreement according to the contract principle ''[[pacta sunt servanda]]''. This consensual view of international law was reflected in the 1920 Statute of the Permanent Court of International Justice, and remains preserved in Article 7 of the ICJ Statute.<ref>[https://www.un.org/en/documents/charter/index.shtml ''Charter of the United Nations''], United Nations, 24 October 1945, 1 UNTS, XVI</ref> The [[sources of international law]] applied by the community of nations are listed under Article 38 of the [[Statute of the International Court of Justice]], which is considered authoritative in this regard:\n\n# International treaties and conventions; \n# International custom as derived from the \"general practice\" of states; and\n# General legal principles \"recognized by civilized nations\".\n\nAdditionally, judicial decisions and the teachings of prominent international law scholars may be applied as \"subsidiary means for the determination of rules of law\".\n\nMany scholars agree that the fact that the sources are arranged sequentially suggests an implicit hierarchy of sources.<ref>{{cite book|title=Fundamental Perspectives on International Law|last=Slomanson|first=William|publisher=Wadsworth|year=2011|location=Boston, USA|pages=26\u201327}}</ref> However, the language of Article 38 does not explicitly hold such a hierarchy, and the decisions of the international courts and tribunals do not support such a strict hierarchy. By contrast, Article 21 of the [[Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court]] clearly defines a hierarchy of applicable law (or sources of international law).\n\n=== Treaties ===\nInternational treaty law comprises obligations expressly and voluntarily accepted by states between themselves in [[treaty|treaties]]. The [[Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties]] defines a treaty as follows<blockquote>''\u201ctreaty\u201d means an international agreement concluded between States in written form and  governed by international law, whether embodied in a single instrument or in two or more related instruments and whatever its particular designation\u201d''<ref>Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties, 1969, Article 2, 1(a)</ref></blockquote>This definition has led case-law to define a treaty as an international agreement that meets the following criteria: \n\n# Criterion 1: Requirement of an agreement, meetings of wills (''concours de volont\u00e9'')\n# Criterion 2: Requirement of being concluded between subjects of international law: this criterion excludes agreements signed between States and private corporations, such as [[Production sharing agreement|Production Sharing Agreements]]. In the 1952 ''[[United Kingdom v Iran]]'' case, the ICJ did not have jurisdiction for a dispute over the [[Anglo-Iranian Oil Company]] being nationalized as the dispute emerged from an alleged breach of contract between a private company and a State.\n# Criterion 3: Requirement to be governed by international law: any agreement governed by any domestic law will not be considered a treaty.\n# Criterion 4: No requirement of instrument: A treaty can be embodied in a single instrument or in two or more related instruments. This is best exemplified in exchange of letters - (''\u00e9change de lettres''). Per exemple, if France sends a letter to the United States to say, increase their contribution in the budget of the North Atlantic Alliance, and the US accepts the commitment, a treaty can be said to have emerged out of the exchange.\n# Criteron 5: No requirement of designation: the designation of the treaty, whether it is a \"convention\", \"pact\" or \"agreement\" has no impact on the qualification of said agreement as being a treaty.\n# Unwritten Criterion: requirement for the agreement to produce legal effects: this unwritten criterion is meant to exclude agreements which fulfill the above-listed conditions, but are not meant to produce legal effets, such as [[Memorandum of understanding|Memoranda of Understanding.]]\n\nWhere there are disputes about the exact meaning and application of national laws, it is the responsibility of the courts to decide what the law means. In international law, interpretation is within the domain of the states concerned, but may also be conferred on judicial bodies such as the International Court of Justice, by the terms of the treaties or by consent of the parties. Thus, while it is generally the responsibility of states to interpret the law for themselves, the processes of diplomacy and availability of supra-national judicial organs routinely provide assistance to that end.\n\nThe [[Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties]], which codifies several bedrock principles of treaty interpretation, holds that a treaty \"shall be interpreted in [[good faith]] in accordance with the ordinary meaning to be given to the terms of the treaty in their context and in the light of its object and purpose.\" This represents a compromise between three different theories of interpretation:\n\n* The '''textual approach,''' a restrictive interpretation that looks to the \"ordinary meaning\" of the text, assigning considerable weight to the actual text.\n* The '''subjective approach''', which takes into consideration factors such as the ideas behind the treaty, the context of the treaty's creation, and what the drafters intended.\n* The '''effective approach''', which interprets a treaty \"in the light of its object and purpose\", i.e. based on what best suits the goal of the treaty.\n\nThe foregoing are general rules of interpretation, and do no preclude the application of specific rules for particular areas of international law.\n\n*''[[Greece v United Kingdom]]'' [1952] [http://www.worldlii.org/int/cases/ICJ/1952/1.html ICJ 1], ICJ had no jurisdiction to hear a dispute between the UK government and a private Greek businessman under the terms of a treaty.\n*''[[United Kingdom v Iran]]'' [1952] [http://www.worldlii.org/int/cases/ICJ/1952/2.html ICJ 2], the ICJ did not have jurisdiction for a dispute over the [[Anglo-Iranian Oil Company]] being nationalized.\n*''[[Oil Platforms case]] (Islamic Republic of Iran v United States of America)'' [2003] [http://www.worldlii.org/int/cases/ICJ/2003/4.html ICJ 4], rejected dispute over damage to ships which hit a mine.\n\n=== International custom ===\nCustomary international law is derived from the consistent practice of States accompanied by ''[[opinio juris]]'', i.e. the conviction of states that the consistent practice is required by a legal obligation. Judgments of international tribunals as well as scholarly works have traditionally been looked to as persuasive sources for custom in addition to direct evidence of state behavior. Attempts to codify customary international law picked up momentum after the Second World War with the formation of the International Law Commission (ILC) under the aegis of the UN. Codified customary law is made the binding interpretation of the underlying custom by agreement through treaty. For states not party to such treaties, the work of the ILC may still be accepted as custom applying to those states. General principles of law are those commonly recognized by the major legal systems of the world. Certain norms of international law achieve the binding force of [[peremptory norm]]s (''jus cogens'') as to include all states with no permissible derogations.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.irwinlaw.com/cold/non-derogable_norm_of_international_law|title=Non-derogable norm of international law {{!}} Irwin Law|website=www.irwinlaw.com|access-date=2019-04-22}}</ref>\n\n*''[[Asylum case|Colombia v Per\u00fa]]''  (1950), recognizing custom as a source of international law, but a practice of giving asylum was not part of it.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.worldlii.org/int/cases/ICJ/1950/6.html|title=Colombia/Peru - Asylum - Judgment of 20 November 1950 - (including the declaration of Judge Zoricic) - Judgments [1950] ICJ 6; ICJ Reports 1950, p 266; [1950] ICJ Rep 266 (20 November 1950)|website=www.worldlii.org|access-date=2019-04-22}}</ref>\n*''[[Belgium v Spain]]'' (1970), finding that only the state where a corporation is incorporated (not where its major shareholders reside) has standing to bring an action for damages for economic loss.\n\n=== Statehood and responsibility ===\n{{See also|Monism and dualism in international law}}\nInternational law establishes the framework and the criteria for identifying [[Sovereign state|states]] as the principal actors in the international legal system. As the existence of a state presupposes control and [[jurisdiction]] over territory, international law deals with the acquisition of territory, [[state immunity]] and the legal responsibility of states in their conduct with each other. International law is similarly concerned with the treatment of individuals within state boundaries. There is thus a comprehensive regime dealing with group rights, the treatment of [[alien (law)|aliens]], the rights of [[refugee]]s, [[Transnational crime|international crimes]], [[nationality]] problems, and [[human rights]] generally. It further includes the important functions of the maintenance of international peace and security, arms control, the pacific settlement of disputes and the regulation of the [[use of force]] in international relations. Even when the law is not able to stop the outbreak of war, it has developed principles to govern the conduct of hostilities and the treatment of [[prisoners of war|prisoners]]. International law is also used to govern issues relating to the global environment, the global commons such as [[international waters]] and [[outer space]], global communications, and [[International trade|world trade]].\n\nIn theory all states are [[Sovereignty|sovereign]] and equal. As a result of the notion of sovereignty, the value and authority of international law is dependent upon the voluntary participation of states in its formulation, observance, and enforcement. Although there may be exceptions, it is thought by many international academics that most states enter into legal commitments with other states out of [[enlightened self-interest]] rather than adherence to a body of law that is higher than their own. As [[D. W. Greig]] notes, \"international law cannot exist in isolation from the political factors operating in the sphere of [[international relations]]\".<ref>Greig, D. W., ''International Law'', 2nd edn (Butterworths: London, 1976)</ref>\n\nTraditionally, [[sovereign state]]s and the [[Holy See#Status of the Holy See in international law|Holy See]] were the sole subjects of international law. With the proliferation of [[international organizations]] over the last century, they have in some cases been recognized as relevant parties as well. Recent interpretations of [[international human rights law]], [[international humanitarian law]], and [[international trade law]] (e.g., [[North American Free Trade Agreement]] (NAFTA) Chapter 11 actions) have been inclusive of corporations, and even of certain individuals.\n\nThe conflict between international law and national sovereignty is subject to vigorous debate and dispute in academia, diplomacy, and politics. Certainly, there is a growing trend toward judging a state's domestic actions in the light of international law and standards. Numerous people now view the nation-state as the primary unit of international affairs, and believe that only states may choose to voluntarily enter into commitments under international law, and that they have the right to follow their own counsel when it comes to interpretation of their commitments. Certain scholars{{who|date=August 2012}} and political leaders feel that these modern developments endanger nation states by taking power away from state governments and ceding it to international bodies such as the U.N. and the World Bank, argue that international law has evolved to a point where it exists separately from the mere consent of states, and discern a legislative and judicial process to international law that parallels such processes within domestic law.  This especially occurs when states violate or deviate from the expected standards of conduct adhered to by all civilized nations.\n\nA number of states place emphasis on the principle of territorial sovereignty, thus seeing states as having free rein over their internal affairs. Other states oppose this view. One group of opponents of this point of view, including many [[Europe]]an nations, maintain that all civilized nations have certain norms of conduct expected of them, including the prohibition of [[genocide]], [[slavery]] and the [[slave trade]], [[war of aggression|wars of aggression]], [[torture]], and [[piracy]], and that violation of these universal norms represents a crime, not only against the individual victims, but against humanity as a whole. States and individuals who subscribe to this view opine that, in the case of the individual responsible for violation of international law, he \"is become, like the [[piracy|pirate]] and the [[slave trade]]r before him, ''[[hostis humani generis]]'', an enemy of all mankind\",<ref>Janis, M. and Noyes, J. International Law\": Cases and Commentary (3rd ed.), Prosecutor v. Furund\u017eija, Page 148 (2006)</ref> and thus subject to prosecution in a fair trial before any fundamentally just tribunal, through the exercise of [[universal jurisdiction]].\n\nThough the European democracies tend to support broad, universalistic interpretations of international law, many other democracies have differing views on international law. Several democracies, including [[India]], [[Israel]] and the [[United States]], take a flexible, eclectic approach, recognizing aspects of international law such as territorial rights as universal, regarding other aspects as arising from treaty or custom, and viewing certain aspects as not being subjects of international law at all. Democracies in the developing world, due to their past colonial histories, often insist on non-interference in their internal affairs, particularly regarding human rights standards or their peculiar institutions, but often strongly support international law at the bilateral and multilateral levels, such as in the United Nations, and especially regarding the use of force, disarmament obligations, and the terms of the UN Charter.\n\n*''[[Case Concerning United States Diplomatic and Consular Staff in Tehran]]'' [1980] [http://www.worldlii.org/int/cases/ICJ/1980/1.html ICJ 1]\n*''[[Democratic Republic of the Congo v Belgium]]'' [2002] [http://www.worldlii.org/int/cases/ICJ/2002/1.html ICJ 1]\n\n=== Territory and the sea ===\n{{Main|Law of the Sea}}The law of the sea is the area of international law concerning the principles and rules by which states and other entities interact in maritime matters.<ref>James Harrison, ''Making the Law of the Sea: A Study in the Development of International Law'' (2011), p. 1. {{verify source |date=August 2019 |reason=This ref was deleted ([[Special:Diff/903683450]]) by a bug in VisualEditor and later restored by a bot from the original cite at [[Special:Permalink/899677351]] cite #1 - please verify the cite's accuracy and remove this {verify source} template.

However, there are means by which breaches are brought to the attention of the international community and some means for resolution. For example, there are judicial or quasi-judicial tribunals in international law in certain areas such as trade and human rights. The formation of the [[United Nations]], for example, created a means for the world community to enforce international law upon members that violate its charter through the Security Council.\n\nSince international law exists in a legal environment without an overarching \"sovereign\" (i.e., an external power able and willing to compel compliance with international norms), \"enforcement\" of international law is very different from in the domestic context. In many cases, enforcement takes on [[Ronald Coase|Coasian]] characteristics, where the norm is self-enforcing.  In other cases, defection from the norm can pose a real risk, particularly if the international environment is changing.  When this happens, and if enough states (or enough powerful states) continually ignore a particular aspect of international law, the norm may actually change according to concepts of customary international law.  For example, prior to World War I, [[unrestricted submarine warfare]] was considered a violation of international law and ostensibly the [[casus belli]] for the United States' declaration of war against Germany.  By World War II, however, the practice was so widespread that during the [[Nuremberg trials]], the charges against German Admiral [[Karl D\u00f6nitz]] for ordering unrestricted submarine warfare were dropped, notwithstanding that the activity constituted a clear violation of the Second London Naval Treaty of 1936.\n\n=== Domestic enforcement ===\nApart from a state's natural inclination to uphold certain norms, the force of international law comes from the pressure that states put upon one another to behave consistently and to honor their obligations. As with any system of law, many violations of international law obligations are overlooked. If addressed, it may be through [[diplomacy]] and the consequences upon an offending state's reputation, submission to international judicial determination,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.icj-cij.org/homepage/index.php|title=Home \u2013 International Court of Justice|publisher=|accessdate=17 August 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130627014957/http://www.icj-cij.org/homepage/index.php|archive-date=27 June 2013|url-status=dead}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.icj-cij.org/docket/index.php?p1=3&p2=3&k=cd&case=1|title=Contentious Cases \u2013 International Court of Justice|publisher=|accessdate=17 August 2015}}</ref> arbitration,<ref>{{cite journal|jstor=2194880|title=Arbitral Opinion Relative to the Gold of the National Bank of Albania|date=1 January 1955|journal=The American Journal of International Law|volume=49|issue=3|pages=403\u2013405|doi=10.2307/2194880}}</ref> sanctions<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.treasury.gov/resource-center/sanctions/Programs/pages/syria.aspx|title=Syria Sanctions|website=Treasury.gov|accessdate=17 August 2015}}</ref> or force including war.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.falklandswar.org.uk|title=The Falklands Conflict|website=Falkslandswar.org.uk|accessdate=17 August 2015}}</ref> Though violations may be common in fact, states try to avoid the appearance of having disregarded international obligations. States may also unilaterally adopt sanctions against one another such as the severance of economic or diplomatic ties, or through reciprocal action. In some cases, domestic courts may render judgment against a foreign state (the realm of private international law) for an injury, though this is a complicated area of law where international law intersects with domestic law.\n\nIt is implicit in the Westphalian system of nation-states, and explicitly recognized under Article 51 of the [[Charter of the United Nations]], that all states have the inherent right to individual and collective self-defense if an armed attack occurs against them. Article 51 of the UN Charter guarantees the right of states to defend themselves until (and unless) the Security Council takes measures to keep the peace.\n\n===International bodies===\n{{Main|International legal system|United Nations General Assembly Resolution 377}}\nAs a \"deliberative, policymaking and representative organ\", the [[United Nations General Assembly]] \"is empowered to make recommendations\"; it can neither codify international law nor make binding resolutions.<ref name=\"UN_GA-Powers\">{{cite web |title=Functions and powers of the General Assembly |url=http://www.un.org/en/ga/about/background.shtml |website=un.org |publisher=United Nations |accessdate=5 October 2018}}</ref><ref name=\"UN_Int-Law\">{{cite web |title=International Law and Justice |url=http://www.un.org/en/sections/issues-depth/international-law-and-justice/index.html |website=un.org |publisher=United Nations |accessdate=5 October 2018|date=2016-08-30 }}</ref> Merely internal resolutions, such as budgetary matters, may be binding on the operation of the General Assembly itself. Violations of the UN Charter by members of the United Nations may be raised by the aggrieved state in the General Assembly for debate.\n\n[[United Nations General Assembly resolution|General Assembly resolution]]s are generally non-binding towards member states, but through its adoption of the [[United Nations General Assembly Resolution 377|\"Uniting for Peace\" resolution (A/RES/377 A)]], of 3 November 1950, the Assembly declared that it had the power to authorize the use of force, under the terms of the UN Charter, in cases of breaches of the peace or acts of aggression, provided that the Security Council, owing to the negative vote of a permanent member, fails to act to address the situation. The Assembly also declared, by its adoption of [[United Nations General Assembly Resolution 377|resolution 377 A]], that it could call for other collective measures\u2014such as economic and diplomatic sanctions\u2014in situations constituting the milder \"threat to the Peace\".\n\nThe Uniting for Peace resolution was initiated by the United States in 1950, shortly after the outbreak of the [[Korean War]], as a means of circumventing possible future Soviet vetoes in the [[United Nations Security Council|Security Council]]. The legal role of the resolution is clear, given that the General Assembly can neither issue binding resolutions nor codify law. It was never argued by the \"Joint Seven-Powers\" that put forward the draft resolution,<ref>United States, United Kingdom, France, Canada, Turkey, Philippines and Uruguay</ref> during the corresponding discussions, that it in any way afforded the Assembly new powers. Instead, they argued that the resolution simply declared what the Assembly's powers already were, according to the UN Charter, in the case of a dead-locked Security Council.<ref name=\"UN_APV299\">{{UN document |docid=A-PV.299 |type=Proces Verbal |body=General Assembly |session=5 |year=1950 |date=1 November 1950 |accessdate=2008-04-13}}</ref><ref name=\"UN_APV300\">{{UN document |docid=A-PV.300 |type=Proces Verbal |body=General Assembly |session=5 |year=1950 |date=2 November 1950 |accessdate=2008-04-13}}</ref><ref name=\"UN_APV301\">{{UN document |docid=A-PV.301 |type=Proces Verbal |body=General Assembly |session=5 |year=1950 |date=2 November 1950 |accessdate=2008-04-13}}</ref><ref name=\"UN_APV302\">{{UN document |docid=A-PV.302 |type=Proces Verbal |body=General Assembly |session=5 |year=1950 |date=3 November 1950 |accessdate=2008-04-13}}</ref> The Soviet Union was the only permanent member of the Security Council to vote against the Charter interpretations that were made recommendation by the Assembly's adoption of resolution 377 A.\n\nAlleged violations of the Charter can also be raised by states in the Security Council. The Security Council could subsequently pass resolutions under Chapter VI of the UN Charter to recommend the \"Pacific Resolution of Disputes.\" Such resolutions are not binding under international law, though they usually are expressive of the Council's convictions.  In rare cases, the Security Council can adopt resolutions under Chapter VII of the UN Charter, related to \"threats to Peace, Breaches of the Peace and Acts of Aggression,\" which are legally binding under international law, and can be followed up with economic sanctions, military action, and similar uses of force through the auspices of the United Nations.\n\nIt has been argued that resolutions passed outside of Chapter VII can also be binding; the legal basis for that is the Council's broad powers under Article 24(2), which states that \"in discharging these duties (exercise of primary responsibility in international peace and security), it shall act in accordance with the Purposes and Principles of the United Nations\". The mandatory nature of such resolutions was upheld by the [[International Court of Justice]]  (ICJ) in its advisory opinion on [[Namibia]]. The binding nature of such resolutions can be deduced from an interpretation of their language and intent.\n\nStates can also, upon mutual consent, submit disputes for arbitration by the [[International Court of Justice]], located in [[The Hague]], [[Netherlands]]. The judgments given by the Court in these cases are binding, although it possesses no means to enforce its rulings.\nThe Court may give an advisory opinion on any legal question at the request of whatever body may be authorized by or in accordance with the Charter of the United Nations to make such a request. Some of the advisory cases brought before the court have been controversial with respect to the court's competence and jurisdiction.\n\nOften enormously complicated matters, ICJ cases (of which there have been less than 150 since the court was created from the [[Permanent Court of International Justice]] in 1945) can stretch on for years and generally involve thousands of pages of pleadings, evidence, and the world's leading specialist international lawyers. As of November 2019, there are 16 cases pending at the ICJ. Decisions made through other means of arbitration may be binding or non-binding depending on the nature of the arbitration agreement, whereas decisions resulting from contentious cases argued before the ICJ are always binding on the involved states.\n\nThough states (or increasingly, [[international organizations]]) are usually the only ones with standing to address a violation of international law, some treaties, such as the [[International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights]] have an optional [[Protocol (treaty)|protocol]] that allows individuals who have had their rights violated by member states to petition the international [[Human Rights Committee]]. Investment treaties commonly and routinely provide for enforcement by individuals or investing entities.<ref>{{Cite web | url=http://finlayson.id.au/index.php/practising-law/australia-indonesia-agreements/ | archive-url=https://archive.today/20120712220742/http://finlayson.id.au/index.php/practising-law/australia-indonesia-agreements/ | url-status=dead | archive-date=2012-07-12 | title=Australia Indonesia Treaties}}</ref> and commercial agreements of foreigners with sovereign governments may be enforced on the international plane.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mondaq.com/australia/article.asp?articleid=12836|title=The Sandline Affair Illegality And International Law* - International Law \u2013 Australia|website=Mondaq.com|accessdate=27 December 2017}}</ref>\n\n===International courts===\nThere are numerous international bodies created by treaties adjudicating on legal issues where they may have jurisdiction. The only one claiming [[universal jurisdiction]] is the [[United Nations Security Council]]. Others are: the United Nations [[International Court of Justice]], and the [[International Criminal Court]] (when national systems have totally failed and the [[Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court|Treaty of Rome]] is applicable) and the [[Court of Arbitration for Sport]].\n\n===East African Community===\n{{Main|East African Community}}\nThere were ambitions to make the East African Community, consisting of [[Kenya]], [[Tanzania]], [[Uganda]], [[Burundi]] and [[Rwanda]], a political federation with its own form of binding supranational law, but this effort has not materialized.\n\n===Union of South American Nations===\n{{Main|Union of South American Nations}}\nThe Union of South American Nations serves the South American continent. It intends to establish a framework akin to the [[European Union]] by the end of 2019. It is envisaged to have its own passport and currency, and limit barriers to trade.\n\n===Andean Community of Nations===\n{{Main|Andean Community of Nations}}\nThe Andean Community of Nations is the first attempt to integrate the countries of the [[Andes Mountains]] in South America. It started with the Cartagena Agreement of 26 May 1969, and consists of four countries: [[Bolivia]], [[Colombia]], [[Ecuador]] and [[Peru]]. The Andean Community follows supranational laws, called Agreements, which are mandatory for these countries.\n\n==International legal theory==\n{{Main|International legal theories}}\nInternational legal theory comprises a variety of theoretical and methodological approaches used to explain and analyse the content, formation and effectiveness of international law and institutions and to suggest improvements. Some approaches center on the question of compliance: why states follow international norms in the absence of a coercive power that ensures compliance. Other approaches focus on the problem of the formation of international rules: why states voluntarily adopt international law norms, that limit their freedom of action, in the absence of a world legislature; while other perspectives are policy oriented: they elaborate theoretical frameworks and instruments to criticize the existing norms and to make suggestions on how to improve them. Some of these approaches are based on domestic [[legal theory]], some are [[interdisciplinary]], and others have been developed expressly to analyse international law. Classical approaches to International legal theory are the [[Natural law]], the Eclectic and the [[Legal positivism]] schools of thought.\n\nThe [[natural law]] approach argues that international norms should be based on [[axiomatic]] truths. 16th-century natural law writer, [[Francisco de Vitoria]], a professor of [[theology]] at the [[University of Salamanca]], examined the questions of the [[just war]], the Spanish authority in the [[Americas]], and the rights of the Native American peoples.\n\nIn 1625 [[Hugo Grotius]] argued that nations as well as persons ought to be governed by universal principle based on [[morality]] and [[Divine retribution|divine justice]] while the relations among polities ought to be governed by the law of peoples, the ''[[jus gentium]]'', established by the consent of the community of nations on the basis of the principle of ''[[pacta sunt servanda]]'', that is, on the basis of the observance of commitments. On his part, [[Emmerich de Vattel]] argued instead for the equality of states as articulated by 18th-century natural law and suggested that the law of nations was composed of custom and law on the one hand, and natural law on the other. During the 17th century, the basic tenets of the Grotian or [[Eclecticism|eclectic]] school, especially the doctrines of legal equality, [[territorial sovereignty]], and independence of states, became the fundamental principles of the European political and legal system and were enshrined in the 1648 [[Peace of Westphalia]].\n\nThe early [[legal positivism|positivist]] school emphasized the importance of custom and treaties as sources of international law. 16th-century [[Alberico Gentili]] used historical examples to posit that positive law (''jus voluntarium'') was determined by general consent. [[Cornelius van Bynkershoek]] asserted that the bases of international law were customs and treaties commonly consented to by various states, while [[John Jacob Moser]] emphasized the importance of state practice in international law. The positivism school narrowed the range of international practice that might qualify as law, favouring [[rationality]] over [[morality]] and [[ethic]]s. The 1815 [[Congress of Vienna]] marked the formal recognition of the political and international legal system based on the conditions of Europe.\n\nModern legal positivists consider international law as a unified system of rules that emanates from the states' will. International law, as it is, is an \"[[Objectivity (philosophy)|objective]]\" reality that needs to be distinguished from law \"as it should be.\" Classic positivism demands rigorous tests for [[law|legal]] [[Validity (logic)|validity]] and it deems irrelevant all extralegal arguments.<ref>[[Bruno Simma]] and Andreas L.Paulus \"Symposium on method in International Law: The Responsibility of Individuals for Human Rights Abuses in Internal Conflicts: A Positivist View\" 93 American Journal of International Law 302  (April, 1999)</ref>\n\n== Criticisms ==\nNation-states observe the principle of {{lang-la|[[par in parem non habet imperium]]|lit=Between equals there is no sovereign power|label=none}}. [[John Austin (legal philosopher)|John Austin]] therefore asserted that 'so-called' international law, lacking a sovereign power and so unenforceable, was not really law at all, but 'positive morality', consisting of 'opinions and sentiments...more ethical than legal in nature.'<ref name=\"auto\">James B Scott, \"The legal nature of international law\", ''[[Columbia Law Review]]'', vol 5 no 2, Feb 1905, p 128-30</ref>\n\nArticle 2 (1) of the [[UN Charter]] confirms this Sovereignty of Nations; no state is in subjection to any other state.\n\nAlso, since the bulk of international law is treaty law, binding only on signatories, then; <blockquote> 'If legislation is the making of laws by a person or assembly binding on the whole community, there is no such thing as international law. For treaties bind only those who sign them.' </blockquote>\nSince states are few in number, diverse and atypical in character, unindictable, lacking a centralised sovereign power, and their agreements unpoliced and decentralised,<ref name=\"auto2\">Wight, power politics, p 109</ref> then, says Wight, 'international society is not a society at all. The condition of international relations is best described as international anarchy;\n<blockquote> 'While in domestic politics the struggle for power is governed and circumscribed by law, in international politics, law is governed and circumscribed by the struggle for power. (This is why) international politics is called [[power politics]]... War is the only means by which states can in the last resort defend vital interests...the causes of war are inherent in power politics.' </blockquote>\n\nOn the subject of treaty law, [[Charles de Gaulle]] said this; 'Treaties are like pretty girls, or roses; they last only as long as they last.'<ref name=\"auto3\">speech, 2/7/1963; [[Oxford Dictionary of Quotations]], OUP 1999, p. 255</ref>\n\nFor [[Hans Morgenthau]], international law is the weakest and most primitive system of law enforcement. Its decentralised nature makes it similar to the law that prevails in preliterate tribal societies.<ref name=\"auto4\">Morgenthau, Politics among nations, fifth edition, Knopf, 1976, p273</ref> A [[monopoly on violence]] is what makes domestic law enforceable; but between nations, there are multiple competing sources of force.<ref name=\"auto5\">ibid, p273-4</ref> The confusion created by treaty laws, which resemble private contracts between persons, is mitigated only by the relatively small number of states.<ref name=\"auto6\">ibid, p 275</ref> On the vital subject of war, it is unclear whether the [[Nuremberg trials]] created new law, or applied the existing law of the [[Kellogg-Briand pact]].\n\nMorgenthau asserts that no state may be compelled to submit a dispute to an international tribunal, making laws unenforceable and voluntary.<ref name=\"auto8\">ibid, p281</ref> International law is also unpoliced, lacking agencies for enforcement.<ref name=\"auto9\">ibid, p 289</ref> He cites a 1947 US opinion poll in which 75% of respondents wanted 'an international police to maintain world peace'; but only 13% wanted that force to exceed the US armed forces. Later surveys have produced similar contradictory results.<ref name=\"auto10\">ibid, p 324</ref>\n\n==See also==\n{{div col|colwidth=30em}}\n*[[List of International Court of Justice cases]]\n* [[List of international public law topics]]\n* [[List of treaties]]\n* [[Lex Junia Licinia|Consular law]]\n* [[Arbitration]]\n* [[Anarchy (international relations)]]\n* [[Aviation law]] and [[Space law]]\n* [[Chapeau (disambiguation)|Chapeau]]\n* [[Centre for International Law (CIL)]]\n* [[Commissions of the Danube River]]\n* [[Comparative law]]\n* [[Conference of the parties]]\n* [[Diplomatic law]] and [[Diplomatic recognition]]\n* [[Environmental agreements]]\n* [[Global administrative law]]\n* [[Global policeman]]\n* [[Graduate Institute of International and Development Studies]]\n* [[International Law Commission]]\n* [[International litigation]]\n* [[International community]]\n* [[International constitutional law]]\n* [[International Law Commission]]\n* [[Internationalization of the Danube River]]\n* [[INTERPOL]]\n* [[Martens Clause]]\n* [[Prize law]]\n* [[Speaking truth to power]]\n* [[Third World Approaches to International Law (TWAIL)]]\n* [[UNIDROIT]]\n* [[United Nations General Assembly Sixth Committee (Legal)]]\n* [[University for Peace]]\n* [[The European Institute for International Law and International Relations]]\n* ''[[Pacta sunt servanda]]'' (agreements are to be kept)\n* [[Roerich Pact]]\n* [[Rule of Law in Armed Conflicts Project (RULAC)]]\n{{div col end}}\n\n== References ==\n=== Citations ===\n{{Reflist}}\n\n{{Ibid|date=May 2018}}\n\n=== Sources ===\n{{refbegin}}\n* I Brownlie, ''Principles of Public International Law'' (7th edn, [[Oxford University Press]], 2008) {{ISBN|0-19-926071-0}}\n* Dominique Carreau, Droit international, Pedone, 10e \u00e9dition, 2009 {{ISBN|9782233005618}}.\n* [[Pierre-Marie Dupuy|P.-M.

During his service in the Air Force, he was promoted to sergeant and worked as an aircraft mechanic and flight engineer for the [[Military Air Transport Service]] ([[Military Air Transport Service|MATS]]).\n\n==Career==\nAfter his discharge from the military, Cussler went to work in the advertising industry, first as a copywriter and later as a creative director for two of the nation's most successful advertising agencies.<ref name=\"numanet\"/> As part of his duties, Cussler produced radio and television commercials, many of which won international awards including an award at the Cannes Lions International Advertising Festival.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Arnold |first1=Helen Ruth |title=The historic novels, true adventures of Clive Cussler |url=https://www.mccookgazette.com/story/2465258.html |accessdate=11 April 2020 |work=McCook Gazette |date=1 December 2017}}</ref>\n\nFollowing the publication in 1996 of Cussler's first nonfiction work, ''[[The Sea Hunters: True Adventures With Famous Shipwrecks|The Sea Hunters]]'', he was awarded a [[Doctor of Letters]] degree in 1997 by the Board of Governors of the [[State University of New York Maritime College]] who accepted the work [[in lieu]] of a Ph.D. thesis. This was the first time in the college's 123-year history that such a degree had been awarded.<ref name=\"numanet\"/>\n\nIn 2002 Cussler was awarded the Naval Heritage Award from the U.S. Navy Memorial Foundation for his efforts in the area of marine exploration.<ref>{{cite web |title=Naval Heritage Award Recipients |url=https://www.navymemorial.org/previous-lone-sailor-award-recipients |publisher=The US Navy Memorial |accessdate=11 April 2020}}</ref>\n\nCussler was a fellow of the [[Explorers Club|Explorers Club of New York]], the [[Royal Geographical Society]] in London, and the American Society of [[Oceanographer]]s.<ref>{{cite web|url= http://www.simonsays.com/content/destination.cfm?tab=1&pid=329146&agid=13|title= Simon Says.com Clive Cussler Biography|accessdate=22 February 2007|format=Web Article|work= |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20060629232050/http://simonsays.com/content/destination.cfm?tab=1&pid=329146&agid=13 |archivedate = 29 June 2006}}</ref>\n\n===Literary career===\nClive Cussler began writing in 1965 when his wife took a job working nights for the local police department where they lived in [[California]]. After making dinner for the children and putting them to bed, he had no one to talk to and nothing to do, so he decided to start writing.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bookreporter.com/authors/au-cussler-clive.asp|title= Bookreporter.com Clive Cussler Biography|accessdate=22 February 2007|format=Web Article|work= }}</ref> His most famous creation is marine engineer, government agent and adventurer [[Dirk Pitt]]. The Dirk Pitt novels frequently take on an alternative history perspective, such as \"what if [[Atlantis]] were real?\" or \"what if [[Abraham Lincoln]] wasn't assassinated, but was kidnapped?\"\n\nThe first two Pitt novels, ''[[The Mediterranean Caper]]'' and ''[[Iceberg (Cussler novel)|Iceberg]]'', were relatively conventional maritime thrillers. The third, ''[[Raise the Titanic!]]'', made Cussler's reputation and established the pattern that subsequent Pitt novels would follow: a blend of high adventure and high technology, generally involving [[megalomania]]cal villains, lost ships, beautiful women, and sunken treasure.\n\nCussler's novels almost always begin with a chapter taking place in the past. These contain none of the novel's main characters and often seem disconnected from the plot until the main characters discover a mystery or secret connecting the events in the first chapter to the rest of the story. This almost always comes in the form of a long-lost artifact which holds the key to the villain's or hero's objectives. Often in the first chapter, a ship or plane carrying a top-secret, important, or dangerous cargo is lost and never found, until it is recovered by a modern character later in the book.\n\nCussler's novels, like those of [[Michael Crichton]], are examples of [[techno-thriller]]s that do not use military plots and settings. Where Crichton strove for scrupulous realism, however, Cussler prefers fantastic spectacles and outlandish plot devices. The Pitt novels, in particular, have the anything-goes quality of the [[James Bond]] or [[Indiana Jones]] movies, while also sometimes borrowing from [[Alistair MacLean]]'s novels. Pitt himself is a larger-than-life hero reminiscent of [[Doc Savage]] and other characters from [[pulp magazines]].\n\nCussler had 17 consecutive titles reach ''[[The New York Times]]'' fiction [[The New York Times Best Seller list|best seller list]]. <ref>{{cite news |last1=Cain |first1=Sian |title=Clive Cussler, bestselling adventure novelist, dies aged 88 |url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/2020/feb/26/clive-cussler-novelist-dies-88 |accessdate=11 April 2020 |work=The Guardian |date=26 February 2020}}</ref> In 2014, [[McFarland Publishing]] released ''The Clive Cussler Adventures: A Critical Review'' by [[Steven Philip Jones]], the first critical review textbook of Cussler's novels.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Ayers |first1=Jeff |title=The Clive Cussler Adventures: A Critical Review by Steven Philip Jones |url=http://www.thebigthrill.org/2014/06/the-clive-cussler-adventures-a-critical-review-by-steven-philip-jones/ |publisher=The Big Thrill |accessdate=11 April 2020 |date=30 June 2014}}</ref>\n\n===NUMA===\nAs an underwater [[List of explorers|explorer]], Cussler discovered more than 60 [[shipwreck]] sites<ref name=\"ValhallaRising\">{{cite book| last =Cussler| first =Clive| title =Valhalla Rising| publisher = Berkley Trade\n|date = 26 October 2004| pages = Inside dust jacket flap| isbn = 978-0-425-20404-7| id =039914787X| nopp =true}}</ref> and wrote non-fiction books about his findings. He was also the founder of the [[National Underwater and Marine Agency]] (NUMA), a non-profit organization with the same name as the fictional government agency that employs Dirk Pitt. \n\nImportant finds by NUMA include:\n\n* {{RMS|Carpathia}}, the ship famed for being the first to come to the aid of {{RMS|Titanic}} survivors.\n* {{ship|CSS|Manassas}}, the first ironclad of the civil war, formerly the icebreaker ''Enoch Train''.\n* ''[[H. L. Hunley (submarine)|H. L. Hunley]]'', the first submarine to successfully sink an enemy vessel - during the American Civil War.\n\nA visual and interactive depiction of Cussler's NUMA Foundation Expeditions has been made available as an extension of NUMA's original website.\n\nFinds formerly believed to be important include:\n* ''[[Mary Celeste]]'', the famed ghost ship that was found abandoned with cargo intact (the identification of this wreck as the ''Mary Celeste'' has since been placed into a state of question after one researcher disputed the claim's authenticity).<ref>{{cite web\n|url=http://news.independent.co.uk/uk/this_britain/article16409.ece\n|title=Dating of wreck's timbers puts wind in sails of the 'Mary Celeste' mystery\n|accessdate=22 July 2009 |publisher=[[The Independent]] |author=Jonathan Thompson |date=23 January 2005}}</ref>\n\n===Media appearances===\nIn what started as a joke in the novel ''Dragon'' that Cussler expected his editor to remove, he would often write himself into his books. At first he wrote himself simple cameos, but later as something of a [[deus ex machina]], providing the novel's protagonists with an essential bit of assistance or information. Often, the character is given an alias and not revealed as Cussler until his exit with the characters remarking on his odd name. The cameos include the Dirk Pitt Adventures, as well as the Fargo Adventures books ''Lost Empire'', ''Spartan Gold'', ''Kingdom'', and ''The Tombs''. ''The Tombs'' also includes his wife, Barbara.\n\nThere are at least two other types of recurring in-jokes that are less obvious to a casual reader. One is the frequent reuse of the name Leigh Hunt for different characters in different novels. Seventeen books have had a character with this name, frequently in the opening prologues, frequently a sailor, usually dying; a notable exception is the first (in chronological order) Dirk Pitt adventure, ''Pacific Vortex!'', in which Admiral Leigh Hunter is a major character, commander of the 101st Recovery Fleet in Hawaii. In the introduction to ''Arctic Drift'', Cussler says there was a real Leigh Hunt who died in 2007 and the novel is dedicated to him. Another is that significant events in several novels occur on July 15 (Cussler's birthday). He also used the name \"Periwinkle\" in his works. In ''The Adventures of Vin Fiz'' (and in other works as well) there appears a donkey named Periwinkle. In ''Valhalla Rising'', the ''Periwinkle'' is the name of a catamaran in which Pitt, Giordino, and Misty Graham are rescued by none other than Cussler himself. Cussler's friend [[Craig Dirgo]] is mentioned in several books.{{citation needed|date=April 2016}}\n\n==Adaptations==\n* The first film of a Clive Cussler novel was ''[[Raise the Titanic (film)|Raise the Titanic!]]'' (1980), starring [[Richard Jordan]] as [[Dirk Pitt]], [[Jason Robards]] as Admiral [[James Sandecker]], [[David Selby]] as Gene Seagram, and [[Anne Archer]] as Dana Seagram.\n* [[Paramount Pictures]] released ''[[Sahara (2005 film)|Sahara]]'' on April 8, 2005, starring [[Matthew McConaughey]] as [[Dirk Pitt]], [[Steve Zahn]] as Al Giordino, [[William H.

The ship is run like a business, with its crew being shareholders, taking jobs for the [[CIA]] and other agencies to help stop crime and terrorism. The crew is adept at disguises, combat, computer hacking and more to aid them in their missions. Kurt Austin, Joe Zavala, and Dirk Pitt all make cameo appearances in the fourth volume, ''Skeleton Coast'' (Cabrillo speaks to Pitt on the telephone; and Austin and Zavala appear at the end).\n\n{| class=wikitable\n|-\n! &nbsp;#&nbsp;\n!

They center around Isaac Bell, a brilliant investigator for the Van Dorn Detective Agency, which appears to be modeled after the real-life [[Pinkerton National Detective Agency|Pinkerton]] Agency. Like Pitt, Bell has an affinity for automobiles and is a crack shot. The first book reveals that Bell survives into 1950 with a wife and grown children. Though the setting is a century ago, the books still qualify as techno-thrillers, since they feature the advanced technology of that time such as private express trains, telegraphs, telephones, dreadnought battleships and early airplanes. Isaac Bell also is a principal character of the background story in the Fargo Adventures novel ''The Gray Ghost''.\n\n{| class=wikitable\n|-\n! &nbsp;#&nbsp; \n! Title\n!

After making dinner for the children and putting them to bed, he had no one to talk to and nothing to do, so he decided to start writing.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bookreporter.com/authors/au-cussler-clive.asp|title= Bookreporter.com Clive Cussler Biography|accessdate=22 February 2007|format=Web Article|work= }}</ref> His most famous creation is marine engineer, government agent and adventurer [[Dirk Pitt]]. The Dirk Pitt novels frequently take on an alternative history perspective, such as \"what if [[Atlantis]] were real?\" or \"what if [[Abraham Lincoln]] wasn't assassinated, but was kidnapped?\"\n\nThe first two Pitt novels, ''[[The Mediterranean Caper]]'' and ''[[Iceberg (Cussler novel)|Iceberg]]'', were relatively conventional maritime thrillers. The third, ''[[Raise the Titanic!]]'', made Cussler's reputation and established the pattern that subsequent Pitt novels would follow: a blend of high adventure and high technology, generally involving [[megalomania]]cal villains, lost ships, beautiful women, and sunken treasure.\n\nCussler's novels almost always begin with a chapter taking place in the past. These contain none of the novel's main characters and often seem disconnected from the plot until the main characters discover a mystery or secret connecting the events in the first chapter to the rest of the story. This almost always comes in the form of a long-lost artifact which holds the key to the villain's or hero's objectives. Often in the first chapter, a ship or plane carrying a top-secret, important, or dangerous cargo is lost and never found, until it is recovered by a modern character later in the book.\n\nCussler's novels, like those of [[Michael Crichton]], are examples of [[techno-thriller]]s that do not use military plots and settings. Where Crichton strove for scrupulous realism, however, Cussler prefers fantastic spectacles and outlandish plot devices. The Pitt novels, in particular, have the anything-goes quality of the [[James Bond]] or [[Indiana Jones]] movies, while also sometimes borrowing from [[Alistair MacLean]]'s novels. Pitt himself is a larger-than-life hero reminiscent of [[Doc Savage]] and other characters from [[pulp magazines]].\n\nCussler had 17 consecutive titles reach ''[[The New York Times]]'' fiction [[The New York Times Best Seller list|best seller list]]. <ref>{{cite news |last1=Cain |first1=Sian |title=Clive Cussler, bestselling adventure novelist, dies aged 88 |url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/2020/feb/26/clive-cussler-novelist-dies-88 |accessdate=11 April 2020 |work=The Guardian |date=26 February 2020}}</ref> In 2014, [[McFarland Publishing]] released ''The Clive Cussler Adventures: A Critical Review'' by [[Steven Philip Jones]], the first critical review textbook of Cussler's novels.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Ayers |first1=Jeff |title=The Clive Cussler Adventures: A Critical Review by Steven Philip Jones |url=http://www.thebigthrill.org/2014/06/the-clive-cussler-adventures-a-critical-review-by-steven-philip-jones/ |publisher=The Big Thrill |accessdate=11 April 2020 |date=30 June 2014}}</ref>\n\n===NUMA===\nAs an underwater [[List of explorers|explorer]], Cussler discovered more than 60 [[shipwreck]] sites<ref name=\"ValhallaRising\">{{cite book| last =Cussler| first =Clive| title =Valhalla Rising| publisher = Berkley Trade\n|date = 26 October 2004| pages = Inside dust jacket flap| isbn = 978-0-425-20404-7| id =039914787X| nopp =true}}</ref> and wrote non-fiction books about his findings. He was also the founder of the [[National Underwater and Marine Agency]] (NUMA), a non-profit organization with the same name as the fictional government agency that employs Dirk Pitt. \n\nImportant finds by NUMA include:\n\n* {{RMS|Carpathia}}, the ship famed for being the first to come to the aid of {{RMS|Titanic}} survivors.\n* {{ship|CSS|Manassas}}, the first ironclad of the civil war, formerly the icebreaker ''Enoch Train''.\n* ''[[H. L. Hunley (submarine)|H. L. Hunley]]'', the first submarine to successfully sink an enemy vessel - during the American Civil War.\n\nA visual and interactive depiction of Cussler's NUMA Foundation Expeditions has been made available as an extension of NUMA's original website.\n\nFinds formerly believed to be important include:\n* ''[[Mary Celeste]]'', the famed ghost ship that was found abandoned with cargo intact (the identification of this wreck as the ''Mary Celeste'' has since been placed into a state of question after one researcher disputed the claim's authenticity).<ref>{{cite web\n|url=http://news.independent.co.uk/uk/this_britain/article16409.ece\n|title=Dating of wreck's timbers puts wind in sails of the 'Mary Celeste' mystery\n|accessdate=22 July 2009 |publisher=[[The Independent]] |author=Jonathan Thompson |date=23 January 2005}}</ref>\n\n===Media appearances===\nIn what started as a joke in the novel ''Dragon'' that Cussler expected his editor to remove, he would often write himself into his books. At first he wrote himself simple cameos, but later as something of a [[deus ex machina]], providing the novel's protagonists with an essential bit of assistance or information. Often, the character is given an alias and not revealed as Cussler until his exit with the characters remarking on his odd name. The cameos include the Dirk Pitt Adventures, as well as the Fargo Adventures books ''Lost Empire'', ''Spartan Gold'', ''Kingdom'', and ''The Tombs''. ''The Tombs'' also includes his wife, Barbara.\n\nThere are at least two other types of recurring in-jokes that are less obvious to a casual reader. One is the frequent reuse of the name Leigh Hunt for different characters in different novels. Seventeen books have had a character with this name, frequently in the opening prologues, frequently a sailor, usually dying; a notable exception is the first (in chronological order) Dirk Pitt adventure, ''Pacific Vortex!'', in which Admiral Leigh Hunter is a major character, commander of the 101st Recovery Fleet in Hawaii. In the introduction to ''Arctic Drift'', Cussler says there was a real Leigh Hunt who died in 2007 and the novel is dedicated to him. Another is that significant events in several novels occur on July 15 (Cussler's birthday). He also used the name \"Periwinkle\" in his works. In ''The Adventures of Vin Fiz'' (and in other works as well) there appears a donkey named Periwinkle. In ''Valhalla Rising'', the ''Periwinkle'' is the name of a catamaran in which Pitt, Giordino, and Misty Graham are rescued by none other than Cussler himself. Cussler's friend [[Craig Dirgo]] is mentioned in several books.{{citation needed|date=April 2016}}\n\n==Adaptations==\n* The first film of a Clive Cussler novel was ''[[Raise the Titanic (film)|Raise the Titanic!]]'' (1980), starring [[Richard Jordan]] as [[Dirk Pitt]], [[Jason Robards]] as Admiral [[James Sandecker]], [[David Selby]] as Gene Seagram, and [[Anne Archer]] as Dana Seagram.\n* [[Paramount Pictures]] released ''[[Sahara (2005 film)|Sahara]]'' on April 8, 2005, starring [[Matthew McConaughey]] as [[Dirk Pitt]], [[Steve Zahn]] as Al Giordino, [[William H.

Like Pitt, Bell has an affinity for automobiles and is a crack shot. The first book reveals that Bell survives into 1950 with a wife and grown children. Though the setting is a century ago, the books still qualify as techno-thrillers, since they feature the advanced technology of that time such as private express trains, telegraphs, telephones, dreadnought battleships and early airplanes. Isaac Bell also is a principal character of the background story in the Fargo Adventures novel ''The Gray Ghost''.\n\n{| class=wikitable\n|-\n! &nbsp;#&nbsp; \n! Title\n!

Of the 300 villages around Urmia, 60 were exclusively Assyrians and 60 were mixed villages with Assyrian, Armenian, and [[Azeri]] communities. Nevertheless, there were over 115 documented Assyrian villages to the west of [[Lake Urmia]] prior to 1918. The home of the Assyrians in Iran has traditionally been along the western shore of [[Lake Urmia]] from the [[Salmas]] area to the Urmia plain.\n\nAlthough similar to Iraq Koine, where Koine ultimately derives from it, the Urmian dialect of this region has [[Farsi language|Farsi]] influence (such as the use of [v] instead of [w]), where, for instance, ''warda'' (\"flower\") will pronounced as \"varda\". Furthermore, unlike many Iraqi Koine speakers, Urmians use /[[Voiceless postalveolar affricate|t\u0283]]/ instead of /k/ and /[[Voiced postalveolar affricate|d\u0292]]/ instead of /g/ \u2013 So for example, words like ''kma'' (\"how much\") in Standard Assyrian (Iraqi Koine) will be ''chma'', and ''gana'' will be ''jana'' (\"self\"), respectively. Incidentally, /d\u0292/ may also be used in some Tyari dialects as well. Furthermore, in many Urmian speakers, namely those who come from Iran, the [[Vowel length#Traditional long and short vowels in English orthography|long /a/]] sound as heard in \"r'''a'''b'''a'''\" (\"plenty\") will be turned into an /\u0252/ sound, so the word may sound like \"''r'''o'''b'''o'''''\".<ref name=\"jaas.org\">http://www.jaas.org/edocs/v20n1/Arianne-diaspora.pdf</ref>\n\nThe [[Urmia]] dialect was the prestige dialect of Assyrian Neo-Aramaic in the 19th and early 20th century, when it was chosen by [[Justin Perkins]], an American [[Presbyterian]] missionary, for the creation of a standard literary dialect of Assyrian, before ultimately a second standard dialect derived from ''General Urmian'' known as \"''Iraqi Koine''\" was developed in the 20th century.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">Rev.

The village takes its name from the historic figure of King Aziz of Tal, who lived in the 4th-5th centuries AD and was the father of St. Talya (Mar Tlaye). In 1935, many Assyrians from Be-Aziza, who are called \"Aziznaye\", were resettled, with other Assyrians from Tal, in the village of Tell-Tal, on the banks of the Khabur River in Syria.\n\n===[[Barwar Tribe|Barwar]] (Upper)===\nSituated to the northwest of Upper Tyari in Hakkari, Turkey, Upper Barwaris speak a dialect very similar to Jilu and Diz people \u2013 Rather distinct to those in the Lower Barwari in Northern Iraq, who speak more like those of the Lower Tyari tribes.

Its main church of St. Shallita, built at the turn of the 17th century, therefore served as the [[List of Patriarchs of the Church of the East|patriarchal cathedral of the Church of the East]] from its founding in 1692 until 1918. The neighboring tribes were subservient to the Patriarch, based in Qochanis, and paid him [[taxes]], with which the patriarch then gave to the Ottomans.<ref>\"The wild Christian tribes of Hakkari, whither no Government of any sort has ever extended, still pay tribute to their Patriarch for transmission to the Sultan; and not taxes through the tax-collector\"</ref> The [[confederation]] was in effect almost like a [[vassal state]] ruled by the Ottoman Empire, and even then the Assyrians were not subservient to the [[Sultan]], but rather the Patriarch.

From that point on the village functioned as the [[de facto]] capital of the Assyrian tribes in the region. The Patriarch residing in the Church of M\u0101r Shal\u012b\u1e6da enjoyed both spiritual and political power over his subjects.

In 1914 it was home to about 500 people and 100 families, with two ancient churches. Around the mid-19th century the Assyrians of Bejo converted from the [[Church of the East]] to [[Catholicism]] and came under the authority of the [[Chaldean Church|Chaldean Patriarchate]] of Babylon. Because of Bejo's location right on the Iraqi-Turkish border, the villagers were expelled by the Turkish military in 1925. After their final expulsion from Turkey, the Assyrians of Bejo (\"Bejwaye\") were resettled in a new village which they named [[Bejo]] (or Bajwa), near Zakho in north Iraq.

Prior to 1915, this area contained more than 20 Assyrian settlements, with about 30 churches and monasteries. Up to 6,000 Assyrians resided there, belonging mostly to the [[Chaldean Catholic Church]] and the [[Church of the East]]. The spiritual centre of the district was the village of Atel, which was the seat of an important [[bishopric]].

After the 1920s, though, with the rest of their community having been banished from Turkey, they turned to either the Chaldean Catholic and [[Syriac Orthodox Church]]es in order to be supplemented with the fundamental spiritual and sacramental necessities.\n\nThe Assyrians of Gaznakh were not forced out of their village in either 1915 or 1924/5, and remained there until the conflict between the Turkish military and rebels from the [[Kurdistan Workers' Party]] (PKK) got worse in 1988. The district of [[Beyt\u00fc\u015f\u015febap]], in which Gaznakh is located, remained part of Hakkari province until 1990, when it added to the newly-created province of \u015e\u0131rnak. At that time there were at least 300 Assyrians living in Gaznakh, but by 1995 all of them had left. By 2000 it was estimated that there were as many as 1,600 Gaznakh people dispersed in countries such as Turkey, Iraq, [[France]], and [[Belgium]].\n\nIn 2004, Assyrians began to return to Gaznakh, spearheading a movement in which another 3 Assyrian villages have also been resettled by their former inhabitants, in the same province. Currently, there are about 50 Assyrians who live in Gaznakh all year round, with many more returning to spend their holidays there in the summer months. The village has [[electricity]], telephone lines, [[running water]], and is accessible by way of an unsealed dirt road.\n\n===Harmanis===\nLocated in G\u00f6velek, [[Van Province]], Harmanis was a mixed settlement in the Timar district of [[Van, Turkey|Van]] around Lake Ercheg. It was home to roughly 30 Assyrian households (150 people) with a church dedicated to the Virgin Mary. The village also had a population of 3 [[Armenian people|Armenian]] families (24 people) and 50 [[Kurds]] families (250 people). Some Assyrians from Harmanis were settled in the village of Umm al-Kayf, on the banks of the Khabur River in Syria, in 1935.\n\n===Iyil===\nLocated in Kamber, Y\u00fcksekova, Iyil was housed 90 families with an ancient church dedicated to Rabban Mar Yonan (the saint and monk [[Jonah]]). Its name probably derives from the [[Aramaic language|Aramaic]] phrase \"'Ayna d-El\", meaning God's spring. This was the birthplace of Mar Thoma Darmo, first Catholicos-Patriarch of the Ancient Church of the East, and many well-known Assyrians originate from here. A group of Assyrians from Iyil settled in the village of Tell-Jazirah, along the Khabur River in Syria, in 1935. There they built a new church dedicated to Rabban Mar Yonan. Significantly, the Rabban Mar Yonan church at Iyil is now the first Assyrian church in Hakkari province to undergo a major and official restoration project.\n\n===[[Jilu]]===\nLocated between the tribes of Baz and Gawar. The Tyari tribes are just to the west. Its speakers tend to have a distinct dialect, with shortened vowels, where /a/ turns into /e/ (e.g. ''raba'' or \"plenty\" is ''reba''). They tend drop the ''t'' in some words and/or use 'y\" instead (''kteta'' or \"''chicken''\" is ''kteya'' and ''khata'' or \"''sister''\" is ''kha''). ''Ta'' in Standard Assyrian (meaning \"come\") is ''hiya'' in the Jilu dialect. Those of Baz and Gawar tribes may also have these features in their speech, but it's mostly Jilu people that have retained these conservative sounds in the modern era. \n[[File:Jiluassyrian.jpg|thumb|230px|Lake nestled by [[orchard]]s and a mountain in Jilu.]]\n\n;Alsan and Meedi\nLocated in Demirli, Y\u00fcksekova, Alsan was native to roughly 100 households with an ancient church dedicated to [[St. Michael]]. Nearby Meedi, was a mixed settlement of Assyrians and Kurds under the jurisdiction of Greater Jilu. Before 1915 there were about 10 Assyrian households in that village.\n\n;Isht\u0101zin\nLocated in [[Ye\u015filta\u015f, Y\u00fcksekova]], the Isht\u0101zin valley was a sub-district of J\u012bl\u016b. This long [[valley]], which runs from northwest to southeast, near a [[tributary]] of the [[Great Zab]]. By the 1840s it was the only Kurdish-inhabited village in the Isht\u0101zin valley. In 1850 the Assyrian population of these villages was about 250 households, and by 1915 they would have increased to about 450 families. There were also five churches in the Isht\u0101zin valley, two of which were dedicated to St. George and St. Mary. The Assyrians of Isht\u0101zin were led by a [[Malik]] ([[chieftain]]), who resided in the village of Samsikk\u00e9. After 1918, the Assyrians of Isht\u0101zin were dispersed. Many of them went on to form communities in [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]], [[Iran]], and also in Russia, [[Iraq]] and Syria.<ref>L\u0101l\u0101y\u0101n, K.A., ''\u0100thor\u0101y\u00e9 d-M\u0101hal d-W\u0101n'', Tehran: Assyrian Youth Cultural Society Press, 1968, pp. 27-31</ref>\n\n;Mata d-Mar Zay'a\nThe village of Mar Zay'a, in \u00c7evrecik, Y\u00fcksekova, was a purely Assyrian settlement occupied by 70 households before 1915. Its ancient church was built by [[Zayya|St. Zaya]] and his disciple St. Tavor in 427 AD. For centuries the village served as the seat of the Mar Sargis metropolitan bishops of Jilu, whose jurisdiction also extended as far as the districts of Baz, Tkhuma and Rekan. The church of Sts. Zay'a and Tavor served as their [[cathedral]]. The Assyrians of Mata d-Mar Zay'a were mostly settled in the village of Khirsheniya, in the [[Dohuk province]] of north Iraq, in 1922. Most of them, however, went on to create urban neighbourhoods, such as the Jilu Camp (Camp al-Sikak) in [[Baghdad]], Jilo Mahallesi in [[Kirkuk]] and Sarbaz in [[Tehran]].\n\n;S\u0101t\nLocated in \u0130kiyaka, Y\u00fcksekova, S\u0101t (also known as S\u0101ten) was mixed Assyrian-Kurdish settlement. The Upper and Middle sections of the [[village]] were occupied by Kurds, the Lower part was populated solely by Assyrians. At that time, it was home to more than 300 people with an ancient church dedicated to St. M\u0101r\u012b the Apostle and Proselytiser of the East, and a village school run by the local [[Chaldean Christians|Chaldean Catholic]] priest. The church was significant as being the only one in the Hakk\u00e2ri highlands dedicated to that particular [[saint]], and it was believed to have been built in the 3rd or 4th century. Also near the village was a mountain [[shrine]] called ''M\u0101r\u012b'm'', sacrosanct to both Christian Assyrians and Muslim Kurds alike.<ref>Chabot, J.B., ''Synodicon Orientale'', Paris, 1902, p. 285</ref>\n\n===Kespiyanish===\nLocated in Mutluca, [[Beyt\u00fc\u015f\u015febap]], [[\u015e\u0131rnak Province]], the village of Kespiyanish is now a Kurdish settlement and it is not mentioned in any [[Syriac language|Syriac]] sources, manuscripts, or travelers' accounts from the 19th and 20th centuries. Its name though is similar to that of other known Assyrian villages, such as Minyanish, Sharanish, Alanish, Maranish, Azyanish, etc. Furthermore, author and scholar Gordon Taylor reported that, when he visited Kespiyanish in 1977, he was shown the intact structure of the village's old Assyrian church. It is not known if this structure still stands today.\n\n===Lewin===\n[[File:Lewinbeekeeping.jpg|thumb|220px|[[Beekeeping]] by a lake in Lewin.]]\nLocated in Ge\u00e7itli Buca\u011f\u0131, Hakkari, the district of Lewin (Levin) is located in the northwest of Hakkari province and contained roughly 11 Assyrian settlements, with about 7 churches and monasteries before 1915. Up to 3,600 Assyrians (about 600 families) lived there, all of whom belonged to the Church of the East. The religious centre of the district was the village of Mata d-\u2018Umra d-Mar Giwargis d-Khargil which, in 1607, was the seat of a bishop named Mar Dinkha. In 1935, many Assyrians from Lewin were resettled in the village of Tell-Kayfchi, on the banks of the Khabur River in Syria. There they built a new church dedicated to St. George of Khargil.\n\n===[[Karakilise, \u015eemdinli|Mar b'Ishu]]===\nLocated in Sar\u0131kaya, Y\u00fcksekova, on the Turkish-Iranian border, close to the tribes in [[Targavar Rural District]] in [[Iran]], Mar b'Ishu was inhabited by roughly 350 menages. It was home to a 5th century monastery dedicated to St. Beh-Isho' of Kmol, which was destroyed in the war between the [[Turkish military]] and the [[PKK]] in the 1980s. At the end of the 19th century, the Kurds ravaged the villages in Mar Bisho with so many of the residents fleeing to Iran, where they founded seven villages in [[Bradost]], eight in [[Margawar]] and seventeen in [[Tergawar]]. A group of Assyrians from Mar-Bhishu settled in the village of Tell-Shamiran, along the Khabur River in Syria, in 1935. Others settled in the village of Qal'ah d-Qasha Avner, near [[Urmia]] in Iran. In both villages they built new churches in honor of St. Beh-Isho'.\n\n===Marga===\nSituated in Yemi\u015fli, Uludere in the \u015e\u0131rnak Province, Marga was a purely Assyrian settlement prior to 1925. Its name in Syriac means a [[pasture]] or [[meadow]]. In 1914 it was home to about 800 people (150 families), with an ancient church dedicated to St. Abraham. Around the mid-19th century the Assyrians of Marga converted from the Church of the East to [[Catholicism]] and came under the authority of the Chaldean Patriarchate of Babylon. Because of Marga's location right on the Iraqi-Turkish border, the villagers were displaced by the [[Turkish military]] in 1925. After their final banishment from Turkey, the Assyrians of Marga were resettled in the villages of Levo, Navkandala and Pirakka, near [[Zakho]] in north Iraq. In Levo they built a new church dedicated to St. Abraham. The largest community of \"Margaye\" outside the Middle East is now in [[Melbourne]], Australia. Margaye people are known to pronounce words that have a T sound with an S, so for instance \"beta\" ('house') will be \"besa\". This is a feature also present in the [[Senaya]] dialect, an Assyrian variety based in [[Iranian Kurdistan]].\n\n===[[Nochiya Tribe|Nochiya]]===\nLocated on the eastern periphery of Hakkari, on the Turkey-Iran border. The Nochiya dialect is the most similar to Urmian of the Hakkari varieties, where they pronounce words akin to those of Standard Assyrian or Iraqi Koine (''beta'', ''kteta'', ''ta'', ''dooli''). Unlike the Urmian dialect though, they lack [[Farsi language|Farsi]] influence, such as the use of [v] instead of [w], and they would use an [e] sound instead of [i] for ''ika'' (\"where\"), just like the other adjacent Hakkari dialects. Moreover, some varieties may say \"msawoteh\" (\"speaking\"), akin to the Tyari dialects, instead of \"hamzomeh\", which is in Urmian and Standard Assyrian.\n\n;B\u00e9-D\u012bw\u00e9\nB\u00e9-D\u012bw\u00e9, in [[Beyyurdu, \u015eemdinli]], was home to upwards of 25 households with two ancient churches dedicated to [[St. John the Baptist]] and [[St. Cyriacus]], as well as a shrine to St. 'Avd\u0101. The name B\u00e9-D\u012bw\u00e9 is Assyrian, and derives from the [[Syriac language|Syriac]] or [[Aramaic language|Aramaic]] phrase Beth-D\u012bv\u00e9, meaning, \"Home of the [[Wolves]]\". In 1922 the Assyrians of B\u00e9-D\u012bw\u00e9 (B\u0101d\u016bn\u0101y\u00e9) were mostly resettled in villages of Iraq's [[Erbil governorate]]. Some of them were later resettled in the village of Fell-Faydhah, on the banks of the Khabur River in Syria, in 1935.\n[[File:Nochiyahregion.jpg|thumb|220px|Road to Saranus in Nochiya.]]\n\n;M\u0101r Dinkh\u0101 and T\u012bs\nLocated in So\u011fuksu, \u015eemdinli was home to upwards of 30 homes. Nearby T\u012bs had the ancient monastery of M\u0101r Dinkh\u0101. The last bishop of this family was killed by invading [[Ottoman Turks|Ottoman]] personnel outside the village of Charbash, near Urmia (Iran), in February 1915, during the [[Assyrian Genocide]]. The former [[Catholicos]]-Patriarch of the Assyrian Church of the East, [[Mar Dinkha IV]], belongs to this family, and T\u012bs is his ancestral village. In 1922 the Assyrians of T\u012bs and 'Umra were mostly relocated in the village of Darbandoke in Iraq's Erbil province. Some of them were later resettled in the village of Fell-Faydhah, on the banks of the Khabur River in Syria, in 1935.<ref>{{citation|last1=Stafford|first1=Ronald Sempill|title=The Tragedy of the Assyrians|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=LSzuzsRh37gC&pg=PA32|year=2006|page=41|publisher=Gorgias Press LLC|isbn=978-1-59333-413-0}}</ref>\n\n;Rustaqa\nSituated in Yaylak, \u015eemdinli, the village of Rustaqa was the spiritual capital of the Nochiya district's Assyrian Christians. Before 1915 it was a purely Assyrian settlement inhabited by 25 households, including that of the Matran family. It was both home to a 5th century monastery dedicated to St. Isho', as well as the seat of the Mar Khnanishu metropolitans of the Church of the East. Rustaqa was the birthplace of St. Mar Yosip Khnanishu. The Assyrians of Rustaqa were mostly settled in the village of Harir, in Erbil province of north Iraq, in 1922.<ref>Stafford, Ronald S., \"The Assyrians in the Mosul Vilayet,\" Royal Central Asian Society Journal, 1934, Vol. XXI, p. 237.</ref>\n\n;Sarunis\nLocated in [[\u00d6ve\u00e7, \u015eemdinli]] in Hakkari, Saranus was home to as much as 40 households with an ancient church ordained to the Virgin Mary, Mother of Christ. In 1922 the Assyrians of Sarunis were mostly resettled in the villages of Hinnare and Darbandoke in Iraq's Erbil province. Some of them were later relocated in the village of Fell-Faydhah, on the banks of the Khabur River in Syria, in 1935.\n\n;Shapatan\n[[File:Shaputnochiya.jpg|thumb|240px|The meadows of Shaput.]]\nIn modern-day \u015eemdinli, [[Hakkari]], the district of Nochiya (Nav\u00e7iya, [[Da\u011f \u0130\u00e7inde]]) was flecked with more than 30 Assyrian communities preceding 1915. At that time, over 700 Assyrian families dwelled there, and they had approximately 34 churches and monasteries. The name Shapatan goes back to ancient times, when it was a province of the [[Assyrian Empire]]. The Assyrians of Nochiya were mostly settled in villages of [[Erbil]] province in northern Iraq, such as [[Diyana]], Hawdiyan, [[Harir]], Batas and Darbandoke, in 1922. A few relocated in the village of Tell-Faydah, along the Khabur River in Syria, in 1935.<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=dgDi9qFT41oC&pg=PA47 A modern history of the Kurds], David McDowall</ref>\n\n;[[Silvaneh District]]\nIn [[Targavar Rural District]], there are 1,019 Assyrians in the purely Assyrian town of [[Mavana]], along with a few thousand more in other villages throughout the district and in the [[Margavar Rural District]] to the south.\n\n===Bentur\u00e9===\nLocated in \u00c7ubuklu, [[\u015eemdinli]], Benture was home to more than 20 households with an ancient church. Its name may [[Derivation (linguistics)|derive]] from the [[Syriac language|Syriac]] phrase \"Beth-Natur\u00e9\", which means \"Place of the Guards\", but most likely comes from the Syriac phrase \"Bayn-Tur\u00e9\", meaning \"Between the Mountains\". The Kurdish name for the region around the village derives from the phrase \"Nav-\u00c7iya\", which also has the same definition. In 1922 the Assyrians of Bentur\u00e9 were mostly relocated in villages of Iraq's Erbil province. Some were later resettled in the village of Fell-Faydhah, on the banks of the Khabur River in Syria, in 1935.<ref name=autogenerated1>Solomon (Sawa) Solomon from Nineveh Magazine 1st & 2nd quarter 1997, vol. 20, no 1&2.</ref>\n\n===[[Tkhuma Tribe|Tkhuma]]===\n[[File:Waterchannel.jpg|190px|thumb|An ancient [[Canal|water channel]] in the village of Berijaye]]\n[[File:Tkhumatribe.jpg|thumb|right|220px|Gawaya village.]]\nJust to the east of Tyari and southwest of Jilu, they have a dialect similar to Tyari, except they say \"''sha''\" for \"''ta''\" ('come') whereas Tyari people say \"''hayo''\".\n\n;Berijaye\nLying in Kaynakl\u0131, \u00c7ukurca, Berijaye contained three churches, the largest of which was dedicated to St. Cyriacus (Mar Quryaqus), located outside the village near a water-powered [[Watermill|mill]] - called D\u00eara La\u015faw\u00ea by local Kurds today. The others were dedicated to St. George (Mar Gewargis) and St. [[Jonah]]. It was one of the last villages to capitulate on 15 September 1915, when the Assyrians were forced out of Hakkari by Ottoman troops and their Kurdish allies. The Assyrians of Berijaye were mostly settled in the hamlet of Tell-Mukhadah, along the Khabur River in Syria, in 1935. There they built a new church dedicated to St. Cyriacus.\n\n;Gawaya\nLocated in \u00c7eltik, \u00c7ukurca, the village was the literal centre of the Tkhuma Assyrian tribal district. Prior to the [[First World War]] it was a purely Assyrian settlement, inhabited by 650 Assyrian families. It was also home to an ancient church dedicated to St. Shallita, and was the residence of the chieftains or maliks of Tkhuma. The Assyrians of Tkhuma Gawaya were mostly resettled in the villages of Tell-Hirmiz and Umm-Ghargan, along the Khabur River in Syria, in 1935. In Tell-Hirmiz, they built a new church dedicated to St. Shallita.\n\n;Gundiktha\nSituated in what's now Ba\u015fak, \u00c7ukurca, to the west of Baz and Jelu and just east of Tyari, it was home to 350 families. Its ancient church was dedicated to [[Ananias of Damascus|St. Ananias]] of the Oaths (Beth-Khanya d-Momatha). Local Kurds now know the church as Der\u00e2 Miskin. This church was notable for a cross called the \"Oath Cross\". The belief was that if someone incorrectly swore an [[oath]] on this cross they would suddenly die. The Assyrians of Gundiktha speak a dialect similar to Tyari people. They mostly settled in the villages of Tell-Sakrah and Tell-Shamah, along the Khabur River in Syria, in 1935. In each village they built a church dedicated to St. Ananias.<ref>Dodge, Bayard, \"The Settlement of the Assyrians on the Khabur,\" Royal Central Asian Society Journal, July 1940, pp. 301-320.</ref>\n\n;Gissa\nLocated in Yaprakl\u0131, \u00c7ukurca contained 75 families and featured an ancient church dedicated to the 4th century Martyr Saint and Catholicos Mar Shim'on Bar-Sabba'e. It was one of the last villages to [[capitulation (surrender)|surrender]] on 15 September 1915, when the Assyrians were forced out of Hakkari by Ottoman troops and their Kurdish allies.

Its Turkish name today is Yaylak. Its [[place of worship|spiritual]] centre was the 4th century Monastery of Rabban Pithyon, which was also a highly regarded place of pilgrimage across the Hakkari highlands, famed for its golden cross. This monastery is located between Mazra'ya and nearby Tkhuma Gawaya, and is known to local Kurds as Der\u00e2 Beruj\u00ee. It was established by the monk Rabban Pithyon, who was a nephew and disciple of St. Eugene.

Tyari (and incidentally, Barwari) people have a distinguishable dialect which features, and rather retains, the [[Conservative (language)|conservative]] [[Voiceless dental fricative|voiceless ''th'']] and [[Voiced dental fricative|voiced ''th'']] sounds instead of [[dental stop]]s, ''t'' and ''d'', which are used in many other Assyrian dialects. A distinctive feature among Tyari speakers is saying ''hayo'' for ''ta'' (\"come\") and ''hola'' for ''doola'' (\"there\"). Each Tyari village will have subtle dialect differences. Most of the Assyrians from Lower Tyari resettled in Northern Iraq.\n\n;[[Ortak\u00f6y, Uludere|Arosh]]\nAn Assyrian tribe in Ortak\u00f6y, [[Uludere]], just south of Geramon and Halmon. Located in [[Sirnak province]], it closely borders the [[Hakkari province]] and also the Iraq border. The Sirnak portion is known as ''\u0100rosh Taxtayta'' (Lower Arosh) and the Hakkari part is called ''\u0100rosh Alayta'' (Upper Arosh), which is now designated as Yukariarus, a small hamlet. Due to the close proximity of the tribes, some Arosh people have mixed with those in Geramon, which lies a few kilometers north of the tribe, and they may be confused for them.\n\n;[[\u00c7\u0131\u011fl\u0131, \u00c7ukurca|Ashith\u0101]]\n[[File:Ashitatribe.jpg|thumb|right|230px|Entrance to Ashita.]]\nLocated in [[\u00c7\u0131\u011fl\u0131, \u00c7ukurca]], Ashita was home to nearly 800 families with a church dedicated to St. George and a shrine to St. [[Abraham]]. The village was divided into the following quarters: Isroor, Meweetha, Matha d-'Umra (Khateebin), Chammaneh and Chammaneh Khtaitha. The name Ashitha comes from the Assyrian word meaning \"[[avalanche]]\", because a part of the village is prone to that natural phenomenon. Even the modern Turkish name of the village, \u00c7\u0131\u011fl\u0131, comes from the Turkish word \u00c7\u0131\u011f, meaning \"avalanche\". In 1922, the Assyrians of Ashitha were mostly resettled in villages of [[Nineveh Governorate]] and Dohuk provinces in northern Iraq, mainly in [[Sharafiya]], [[Bakhetme]] and [[Sarsing]]. Furthermore, most Tyari Assyrians tend to be from Ashita (''Ashetnaye'') and it is one of the most common Assyrian tribe.<ref>Sykes, BG Sir Percy, \"The Assyrians in Iraq: A summary of their history from 1918-1933,\" Royal Central Asian Society Journal, 1934, Vol. XXI, p. 269.</ref>\n\n;Bel\u0101th\u0101\nSituated in Ta\u015fl\u0131k, \u00c7ukurca, Belatha was home to 100 families, and was also the village where the chiefs of Lower Tyare resided. Belatha is held to be one of the four original villages of the Tyare districts. Many Assyrians from the districts of Upper Tyare and Tkhuma, as well as the Be-Nikho and Be-Majje clans of Ashitha, have their heritage here. Above the village was the ancient monastery of [[Babai (Nestorian patriarch)|St. Babai]], which still stands today. The name Belatha comes from the Syriac phrase \"Beth-'Allatha,\" meaning \"place of fruits\" or \"place of crops\". It may also derive from the Syriac phrase \"Beth-'Ilyatha,\" meaning \"place of the heights\". The Assyrian dance \"Belati\" originate from this village. After 1924, Assyrians from Belatha settled in several villages of north of [[Amadiya]] and in the [[Nahla valley]] in the district of '[[Aqrah]] in Iraq. In the 1960s, the Assyrians of Chamme-Sineh were forced out by Kurds and eventually resettled in the nearby village of Kashkawa. Unlike other Lower Tyari dialects, they would say ''didan'', as instead of ''diyen'' for \"our\" ([[possessive plural]]).<ref>http://soc-wus.org/ourchurch/Pat_V_Adiyaman.htm</ref>\n\n;Bne Gipa\nAn Assyrian settlement just to the south of Minyanish, in Cukurca. At the start of [[World War I]], the people of the Bne Gipa village were dispossessed and impoverished. Had enough of sharing villages with other Assyrians, they had patiently waited for the end of the War with the anticipation that they would be allowed to return to their native homelands in the Hakkiari Mountains. They temporarily settled in Mayeh village in the Barwar region where they were to stay there from 1914 to 1916. They consequentially moved to Male Arab, a village near Zakho, for a year and a half. In 1922, around eighty families built three villages on a remote track of empty land alongside the Khabour River in Northern Iraq. The 3 villages were Gonda Kosa, Gonda Naze and Hara Kunda Sindy. \n\n;G\u00e9r\u0101mon\nLocated in Yarma, [[Uludere]] in [[Sirnak province]], in the valleys (Galliyane) west of Tyare, Geramon was home to more than 80 households, containing a 6th-century church that was dedicated to [[John of Damascus|St. John the Arab]]. From 1922 onward, the Assyrians of Geramon immigrated to Iraq. Its inhabitants are called ''Geresenayeh''. Due to its very close proximity to Halmon, the tribes share a cultural [[symbiosis]] and have an affinity towards each other. As such, many Assyrians from Iraq fallaciously consider ''Halmonaye'' as being ''Geresnaye'', whereas those [[Syrian Assyrians|from Syria]], conversely, label people from Geramon as ''Halmonaye''. Moreover, ''Aroshnaye'' are a tribe within their vicinity who may also be confused for either of them.<ref>Rassam, A.

The village consisted of over 60 households, with a 4th century church dedicated to St. Shmuni. The Assyrians of Halmon were eventually settled in the village of Cham-Suske, in the Dohuk province of northern Iraq, in 1922, after violence and persecution. Afterwards, some were resettled in the village of Tell-Jum'ah, along the Khabur River in Syria, in 1935.\n\nThere are many [[Assyrian folk/pop music|Assyrian songs]] that have the word ''Halmon'' in their titles and lyrics. The songs are usually associated with the [[Assyrian folk dance]]. [[Adwar Mousa]] is a prominent Assyrian singer and lyricist from Halmon.\n\nUnlike other Assyrian tribes, Halmonites are the only speakers who have [[Conservative (language)|retained]] the [[classical Syriac]] [[diphthong]] {{IPA|[e\u026a\u032f]}} in words like ''psh'''ey'''na'' (\"greetings\") and ''kh'''ey'''la'' (\"power\"), where in other dialects and also Standard Assyrian speech (or Iraqi Koine), the [[monophthong]] /\u025b/ is used instead. Nonetheless, in formal speech, [[hymns]] and some forms of [[anthems|nationalistic music]], /\u025b/ may be diphthongized in Standard Assyrian as well.<ref>Chevalier, Michel, Les Montagnards Chr\u00e9tiens du Hakkari et du Kurdistan Septentrional (Paris, 1985)</ref>\n\n;Lizan\n[[File:Lizantyari.jpg|thumb|230px|The lush village of Lizan.]]\nIn K\u00f6pr\u00fcl\u00fc, \u00c7ukurca, Lizan was contained 80 households with an ancient church dedicated to [[St. George]]. The Assyrians of Lizan were forced out of their village in 1915 and again in 1924. The village was known for its famous bridge, which spanned the Upper Zab River between Lizan and the Kurdish village of Geyman. As such, the contemporary [[Turkish name]] for the village means \"bridged\". Currently, the church of St. George in Lizan is being used as a [[barracks]] by the Turkish military, which supervises the nearby Kurdish village of Geyman, as well as the Iraqi border nearby. The Assyrians of Lizan originated from the village of Matha d-Qasra (Qasran, now known as G\u00fcll\u00fcce). After 1925 the Assyrians of Lizan were resettled in the districts of Barwari-Bala and Nahla in northern Iraq's Dohuk and Ninawa governorates.<ref>Brigadier-Gen. H.H. Austin, \"The Baqubah Refugee Camp\", The Faith Press, london 1920.</ref>\n\n;Miny\u0101nish\nLocated in G\u00fczeldere, \u00c7ukurca, Miny\u0101nish was one of the largest villages in Lower Ty\u0101r\u00e9 inhabited by more than 100 menages. The four ancient churches of the village were dedicated to the Virgin Mary, St. Shmuni, Rabb\u0101n Y\u0101qu and Rabb\u0101n S\u0101hd\u0101. The Assyrians of Miny\u0101nish are believed to originate from the ancient village of Lagipp\u0101, also in Lower Ty\u0101r\u00e9, and they must have settled there sometime prior to the 10th century, over 1,000 years ago.  After 1924, the Assyrians of Miny\u0101nish were settled in northern Iraq. Their most important settlement there, right now, is the village of Kashk\u0101w\u0101 in the Nahl\u0101 Valley north of the town of 'Aqrah (Akre). Unlike the other Lower Tyari tribes, they use \"sh\" sound instead of \"th\" or \"t\" \u2013 So \"beta\" (''house'') will be \"besha\".<ref>Bird, Isabella. \"Journeys in Persia and Kurdistan, including a summer in the Upper Karun region and a visit to the Nestorian rayahs\".

[[Zawita]] in Northern Iraq was named after this village, after the Assyrians settled there.\n\n===Tyari (Upper)===\nThe valley of Upper Tyare, in Hakkari, straddles the banks of the Upper Zab River. Up until 1915, this [[valley]] contained 20 purely Assyrian settlements (not including those in side valleys, such as Koh, Malota d-Malik, Mabbuwa, Rumta, Qallayatha, Sarspidho, etc.). At that time, these 20 settlements contained as much as 450 Assyrian families with 8 ancient churches. The dialects of the Assyrians in the Upper Tyari area, unlike those in Lower Tyari, generally use an \"sh\" sound instead of \"th\" for words like \"beta\" (\"besha\"), meaning \"house\"\n\nThe Assyrian settlements in the Upper Zab valley of Uper Tyare included: Zorawa, Chamba d-Badal, Dizza, Chamba Khadta (Chamba d-Mira), Darawa d-Walto, Chamba d-Hasso, Roma Smoqa, Be-Mariggo, Chamba d-Kurkhe, Dadosh, Chamba d-Tuwan, Be-Dalyatha, Chamba d-Malik, Be-Samano, Chamba d-Rora, Mazra d-Rumta, Chamba d-Be-Eliya, Chamba d-Qurdaye and ''Siyadhor.\n\nThe descendants of Assyrians from the Upper Tyare valley now live in the village of Kore-Gavana in northern Iraq's Dohuk province, as well as the villages of Tell-Tamr and [[Tell Tawil]] on the banks of the Khabur River in Syria.\n\n;Mazra d-Rumta\nIn Kaynakl\u0131, Hakkari, Mazra d-Rumta was a purely Assyrian settlement home to roughly 5 households. This was one of the more than 10 [[hamlets]] in the Rumta sub-district of Upper Tyare, known in [[Kurdish language|Kurdish]] as Rumtik or Rindke. The village of Mazra d-Rumta was based around the 5th century Monastery of St. Sava, which was a major pilgrimage site and served as an abode for the [[patriarchs]] of the Church of the East, whenever they would visit the Upper Tyare valley. Most Assyrians from Rumta were resettled in the village of Tel-Taweel, on the banks of the Khabur River in Syria, in 1935. Unlike the majority of Tyari tribes, they use \"sh\" sound instead of \"th\" or \"t\" \u2013 So \"beta\" (''house''), which is in standard Assyrian, will be ''besha''. They would also say ''didan'' as instead of ''diyen'', for \"our\", like those of Belatha and unlike other Assyrian dialects.<ref>Browne, W.H. The Catholicos of the East and His People, Being the Impressions of Five Years' Work in the Archbishop of Canterbury's Assyrian Mission (London, 1892)</ref> \n[[File:Qalaythatribe.jpg|thumb|230px|Qalyatha village.]]\n\n;Qalaytha\nLocated in Ge\u00e7imli, Hakkari, Qalaytha (or Kelayta) was home to roughly 65 households. Their main church was built in 1818 and was dedicated to Christ's [[Holy Sepulcher]] in [[Jerusalem]] (Qaddishta). Other shrines in the village were dedicated to St. John and [[Macarius of Egypt|St. Abba Macarius]]. Today the village, which has been repopulated by Kurds, mainly serves as the location of an important Turkish military base. The Assyrians of Qalayatha were largely resettled in Tell-Tamr, on the banks of the Khabur River in Syria, in 1935.\n\n;Chamba d-Malik\nSituated in the modern village of Olgunlar in Hakkari, the village was home to more than 60 households and was the residence of the Maliks of Upper Tyare 'Most notifiable the MalikIsmail Family'. The ancient church in was dedicated to St. Sergius the Martyr (Mar Sargis). There was also a monastery near the village dedicated to [[Abraham Kidunaia|St. Abraham]], where the [[Chaldean Catholic]] bishop Mar Abraham d-Bet Mar Shimun died in 1915. In 1935, the Assyrians of Chamba d-Malik (\"Chammanaye\") were relocated in the village of Tell-Tamr, on the banks of the Khabur River in Syria. There they built a new church dedicated to [[Sergius and Bacchus|St. Sergius]] and St. George, which belongs to the Ancient Church of the East.\n\n;Walto\n;Khidhyana and Resha d-Nahra\n[[File:KhidhyanaWalto.jpg|thumb|220px|The village of Khidyana.]]\nLocated in Ceylanl\u0131, Hakkari, the villages of Khidhyana and Resha d-Nahra (\"Head of the River\") were purely Assyrian settlements. At that time, Khidhyana was had about 100 Assyrian households with an ancient church dedicated to St. John. Resha d-Nahra was inhabited by roughly 50 households and its church was dedicated to the Virgin Mary. In 1935, most of the Assyrians of Khidhyana and Resha d-Nahra were resettled in the village of [[Tell Nasri]], on the banks of the Khabur River in Syria. There, with other Assyrians from the Walto valley, they built a new church dedicated to the Virgin Mary.\n\n;;Sirta\nLocated in S\u00fct\u00e7\u00fcler, Hakkari, the village of Sirta was home to at least 80 households. It was situated in the district of Walto, and its church was dedicated to St. John. The Assyrians of Sirta were mostly resettled in the village of Tell-Nasri, along the Khabur River in Syria, in 1935. There, they inhabit their own neighbourhood in a village populated only by other Assyrians from the Walto district.\n\n;;Ishta d-Nahra\nLocated in Derav, Hakkari, its Assyrian name means \"the end of the river\", since it was located at the concourse of the Walto River with the Upper Zab. Its more ancient name, found in Syriac manuscripts, is \"Tra'-Nahra\" (meaning the River's Gate). Prior to 1915, Ishta d-Nahra was home to more than 30 Assyrian households, with an ancient church dedicated to St. Eugene the Blessed (Mar Awgin, or Mar Marogen), who lived in the 4th century. The Assyrians of Ishta d-Nahra were mostly resettled in Tell-Tamer on the banks of the Khabur River in Syria, in 1935. They did not build a new church dedicated to St. Eugene, but still kept the cross from this church and celebrate his [[feast day]] every year.\n\n===[[Turoyo|Western Assyrian]] tribes===\n;[[Batman

Lucie returns to her mother's house when Gracie has fallen ill. While her mother is in the hospital, Lucie stays at Gracies house, and her memories take her back to different parts of her childhood. We are offered a glimpse into a very bleak reality. Lucie is required, at the age of four, to make breakfast for Gracie and her current boyfriend, J.D. One morning while Gracie is sleeping off the drinking from the previous night, J.D. begins to verbally abuse Lucie. He mimics her; he tells her shes trash and so is her mother. All of this is being said while the four-year-old makes him breakfast. After J.D. sexually molests her, Gracie decides to take Lucie to the farm to stay with Lizzie. Unaware of the abuse, she only sees that J.D. is upset with Lucies lack of respect for two years, and most of the novel takes place during this time. It is here that Lucie hears more stories of her heritage. Arriving a child wise beyond her years to the pain of the world, Lucie's time at the farm allows her to learn how to be a child, to play, to pretend.<ref>Voices from the Gaps: Women Artists and Writers of Color,\nAn International Website. \u00a92004 Regents of the University of Minnesota. http://voices.cla.umn.edu/vg/Critique/review_fiction/faces_in_the_moon_by_betty_louise_bell.html Accessed 20 April 2008.</ref>\n\nIt is Lizzie, a \"full-blooded\" woman, who mediates the young girl's relationship to the traditional past. Lizzie not only represents an alternative to Gracie's dissolute lifestyle, but she also helps preserve the history and meaning of the lives of the women in the family by telling and retelling stories imbued with what she thinks it means to be an Indian woman. Years later, when Gracie is hospitalized, Lucie returns to [[Oklahoma]], and with her return come the memories of childhood.<ref>Sanchez, Greg.\nAmerican Indian Quarterly, Vol. 19, No. 2 (Spring, 1995), pp. 268-269.

Helen spent much of her childhood with Lizzie, Emmie, and their mother. She is Gracie and Rozella's mother and Lucie's grandmother. She got pregnant by a [[Scottish people|Scotch]] preacher who left her after Rozella was born. Helen and her daughters lived in an abandoned car. She worked during The Great Depression in order to make a living for her family. Helen and Lucie are linked through their love of the story of Quanah Parker. The title of the book refers to Helen's face; Lucie, as a child and as an adult, comments that she sees Helen's face in the moon.\n* '''Gracie Evers'''- Gracie is Lucie's mother, Rozella's sister, Helen's daughter, and Lizzie's niece. Gracie represents internalized white, mainstream culture. She has been through numerous husbands and has altered her appearance to look as far from native as possible. She sends Lucie to live with Lizzie at the request of J.D. It is Gracie's death that summons Lucie back to [[Oklahoma]]. As an older woman, Gracie stores numerous cans of food in an attempt to ensure she is never hungry like she was as a child.\n* '''Lucie Evers'''- Lucie Gracie's daughter and is the protagonist of the story. She is a mixed-blood ([[Cherokee]] and [[Scottish people|Scotch]]) that is trying to cope with an identity crisis. Lucie is taken to her Aunt Lizzie's house around the age of four and lives with her for the majority of her childhood. She escapes to [[California]] and lives there as an adult. However, she returns to [[Oklahoma]] when she learns her mother is ill. Lucie is often described as looking like her grandmother Helen. Her memories and experiences are the substance of the book. In an autobiographical fiction context, Betty Louise Bell and Lucie are synonymous.\n* '''Rozella'''- Rozella is Gracie's younger sister, Helen's daughter, and Lucie's \"Auney.\" She has been through four marriages yet never divorced. When she grows bored with her husband, she always goes to Gracie for comfort. Lucie describes her as \"silent and placid, she told no tales and didn't hit\" (11). She is a heavy smoker who always seemed to marry heavy drinkers. When she dies, she leaves Lucie a lighter and a letter (written by Gracie) telling her how proud she was of her.\n* '''Lizzie Evers'''- Lizzie is a full blood [[Cherokee]] Indian woman. She is a sister-in-law to Helen Evers. Lizzie is Gracie's aunt and Lucie's great aunt. She takes care of Lucie after the incident with J.D and introduces her to the native heritage that her mother (Gracie) has suppressed. Lizzie suffers, and eventually dies, from ''tuberculosis''. She represents the traditional culture of Native Americans and serves as a foil character to Gracie.\n* '''Uncle Jerry'''- Uncle Jerry is Lizzie's husband that suffers from war-induced post traumatic stress syndrome. He constantly talks to his radio. At the end of the novel, he uses the money Lizzie saved for her burial to buy a television set.\n*'''Jeeter'''- \"Old man Jeeter\" is the man Helen married to ensure a home and food for her children. He is not represented in a very positive way. Gracie says she and her sister talked to their mother \"about old man Jeeter and the hard life they had without her\" (18). Nevertheless, the Gracie and Rozella stayed with him after Helen's death.\n* '''Mabel'''- Mabel is Gracie's landlady and the woman who tells Lucie of her mother's illness. She is often represented as the prying neighbor.\n* '''J.D.'''- J.D. is a supply sergeant stationed at Fort Hill. He is a heavy drinker and steals cigarettes, alcohol, and food from the government. J.D. dislikes Lucie and teases her constantly. He is also very abusive, hitting both Lucie and her mother. In a horrible incident when Lucie is only four years old, J.D. rapes her in the kitchen while Gracie sleeps. He threatens to leave Gracie if she does not get Lucie out of the house.\n* '''Donny Khatib'''- Donny is a [[Lebanon|Lebanese]] hairdresser and Gracie's third husband. He came to the [[United States]] in his late forties. He and Gracie originally set up barber's chairs in the corner of a laundromat to make a living. Donny physically abuses Gracie throughout their marriage. He served seven years in prison after assaulting a teenage boy for making a racist comment against him.\n* '''Johnnie Bevis'''- Johnnie is Gracie's current boyfriend. Johnnie is known for dating Indian women. He has children with an Indian woman named Delores but is now interested in Gracie.\n*'''Uncle Henry'''- Uncle Henry is Bertha's husband. He spent time in an Indian Boarding School run by [[Southern Baptists]]. He and Bertha have ten children who all went to college. Uncle Henry has one leg due to an injury sustained in [[World War I]]. Gracie calls him an \"uppity Indian\" (43).\n*'''Aunt Bertha'''- Aunt Bertha is Henry's [[Choctaw]] wife. She is short and plump with a round face. In an important part of the novel, Aunt Bertha makes the comment, alluding to Lucie, that mixed bloods are beautiful people.\n*'''Melvin'''- Melvin is Lucie's ex-husband. He and his family did not respond kindly to Gracie when she came to Melvin and Lucie's wedding.\n*'''Emmie'''- Emmie is Lizzie's sister. Lizzie makes brief reference to her when she describes Helen to Lucie.\n\n==Major Themes==\n* '''Oral Storytelling'''\nOral storytelling is prevalent throughout ''Faces in the Moon''. Oral storytelling is very important in [[Cherokee]] culture because it is a communal activity. Gracie and Rozella sit around the kitchen table and tell stories. Lizzie tells stories to Lucie. Although Gracie constantly reminds readers that Lucie does not have a story, Lucie is in fact telling her own story through the novel. Lucie often complains that she is tired of living in the past through stories. However, she acknowledges their importance in her life and says, \"no matter how great my desire to run away from home, to live in a place and history free from secrets, I always take up my position at the table\" (5). The novel itself also sounds like the spoken word. Readers get the sense that they are listening in on a conversation, maybe even participating at times, rather than having limited participation as outsiders. The book is dense with women's voices. Perhaps this is Bell's way of giving agency back to women after their voices had been left out due to [[colonization]].\n\n* '''Identity Crisis'''\nThe best example of identity crisis can be seen through Lucie, the character representing the youngest generation. A cause of her identity crisis is through naming. As a child, she lived with an aunt who \u201cnever bothered with divorce, she simply lived in one married name until the opportunity for another came along\" (11). Not only was it her aunt that did this, but her mother switched names as well. Her mother and aunt constantly moving from man to man and name to name is consistent with how the Cherokee's culture was changing as a result of their removal. This leads Lucie to confusion, and she asks to be baptized as Antoinette. Since she is so young, one may think making up a name is childish play, but baptism is not usually an act taken lightly. It is also important to notice that neither Lucie nor the reader knows her last name, adding to her confused identity.\n\n* '''Confusion Regarding Cherokee Heritage'''\nBell makes her characters question their [[Cherokee]] heritage. Lucie can be seen as a victim of this confusion because she cannot relate to her non-native or her native side. Gracie and Auney send mixed signals by choosing \u201chigh heels over moccasins, blue eyes over black eyes\u201d (58). They alter their looks to seem less [[Cherokee]] but claim to be [[Cherokee]]. The women are also mixed bloods (Scotch and Cherokee). Because of the mixed signals from her relatives, Lucie struggles with the notion of whether she is Cherokee or not because she knows she too is of mixed blood and she has conflicting identities. To complicate things even further, she hears Reverend Tom Cottonmouth say, \u201cif youse got Cherokee blood a-running through your veins, no matter how distant, no matter how pre-e-e posterous, no matter how recent, the Cherokee loves y\u2019all\u201d(57). He makes a mockery of the Cherokee saying \u201cFor a ten dollar bill, no checks please, we\u2019ll send ya a authentic certificate of Cherokee blood. And wait Indian brothers and sisters, ifn ya do that \u2018fore midnight tonight, we\u2019ll send ya a genuine rock from the Cherokee nation\u201d(57). Reverend Cottonmouth's claim is so ridiculous that it makes being Cherokee seem accessible for everyone. It's like the ultimate slap on the face for true [[Cherokee]] who suffered through the [[Indian Removal]]. This leaves Lucie confused because there is nothing she can relate to.\n\n*'''Traditional vs. New'''\nThroughout the novel, Bell juxtaposes what it means to live closer to the traditional way of native life as compared to the new way. She uses Lizzie and Gracie as representations of the traditional and new way of life, respectively. She farms the same land that she has always lived on and refuses to accept the stolen goods from Gracie's current love interest. Lizzie shows power and strength as she deals with the terrible disease of tuberculosis. She also tells many stories to Lucie and encourages her to dream. Also, Lizzie and Uncle Jerry share the workload on the farm; this shows the importance of a balance of power between men and women and is another stark contrast to the patriarchal society of mainstream culture.\nWhereas Lizzie has retained her native qualities, Gracie has internalized mainstream white culture. Her hair is dyed an unnatural platinum blonde. She tried to dye Rozella's hair, and nearly burned it all off. She even shaved Lucie's eyebrows and lined her eyes with dark makeup. Instead of working for her food like Lizzie does, Gracie stores the stolen goods from J.D. and sometimes profits from them. Bell is not only critiquing the internalization of mainstream, white culture, but she is saying that this goes hand-in-hand with the unnatural. Lizzie is connected to nature whereas Gracie seems in a way, concerned only with the synthetic.\n\n* '''Generational Gap'''\nGracie and Auney's attempt to maintain [[Cherokee]] culture through storytelling roles has in a sense failed, or caused a gap, in generations because at this point, the [[Cherokee]] are so far removed from their original customs that the next generation (or Lucie) cannot identify with the stories. Lucie says on page 58 that she \u201cknew no Indian princesses, no buckskin, no feathers, no tomahawks.\u201d She goes on to say that she tried to see the women in her life as Indians but that she can\u2019t. Her lack of understanding the stories further complicates her identity as she has no first hand experience with tradition but at the same time is too far gone to get it back. Bell introduces a sense of worry in the text by making the reader question \u201cwell what is going to happen to the next generation?\u201d\n\n*'''Stability'''\nBell relates stability to both physical and psychological firmness and strength. She constructs characters that differ in their reactions to their [[Cherokee]] heritage in order to show that the strongest, most stable characters are those who do not run away from who they are. As a child and as an adult, Lucie struggles with the concept of her mixed blood heritage. She is connected to images of movement as she tries to figure out who she is. There is the image of physical movement as Lucie rides in her mother's car on the way to Lizzie's house. Lucie's physical movement is linked to psychological insecurity because she is unsure of what to expect. While at Lizzie's, Lucie comes down with an illness and has nights of restless sleep. In her dreams, she is running from wild dogs. She sees a native woman in the dream but cannot reach her. In the previous pages, Lucie and Lizzie were discussing why Lucie could not smile and wave to white men in the general store. When Lucie asked why she had to walk with her head down, Lizzie replied, \u201cYou\u2019re just different\u201d (107). Lucie's dream and the physical movement of running and reaching within it can be connected to a lack of psychological strength concerning who she is. Lucie tries to run and reach out to her native side, but her actions fall short because she does not understand what it means to be mixed blood, Cherokee, and/or \u201cdifferent.\u201d The movement continues into Lucie's adulthood; she moves to California to escape the psychological hardships of her life in Oklahoma. At the end of the novel, Lucie is at her mother's funeral and sees three does. Her moment of physical and psychological stability emerges when \u201ca stillness surrounded her, no leaf fluttered, and no bird sang, the earth paused waiting as I waited, giving up this moment to her peace\u201d (186).\n\n*'''Critique of Historical Documents'''\nThe United States Government told [[Cherokee]] Indians that they would get a certain amount of land in [[Indian Territory]]. However, many Cherokee did not understand the complicated diction that the officials used. Bell spends five and a half pages critiquing the historical documents related to these incidents. Colonel Needles asks Robert Evers, Helen's father, a list of questions regarding his family. Evers answers them to the best of his ability even when some are obviously meant to belittle the Cherokee. For example, the Colonel treats him like a suspect when he asks if he has ever discussed seceding from the Union. The Colonel's last question is intricately worded and ends with the agreement that Evers\u2019 land can be revoked at any time. Evers, not understand, replies with \u201cSir?\u201d. This scene represents how the government manipulated the Cherokee through complicated language and ultimately made it possible to legally strip them of their promised land. Bell also critiques Helen Evers\u2019 death certificate.  Both her date and place of birth is unknown. Her father's name is listed as \u201cnone.\u201d Bell expresses, through Lucie's viewpoint, the sickening feeling she gets when she reads this. Critiquing these documents also allows Bell to comment on how the Cherokee people are/were viewed as disposable and in some cases, nonexistent.\n\n==Historical, Cultural, and Artistic Allusions==\n* '''[[Quanah Parker]]'''\nLizzie tells Lucie a story about the mixed blood warrior, Quanah Parker. Later, Lucie dreams about him and wonders if she should tell her great aunt. When Gracie comes to visit, Lucie mentions that she has seen Quanah Parker. Lizzie warns the child of calling up spirits whereas Gracie laughs and calls it another one of Lizzie's stories. In history, Quanah Parker was an \"able metis chief of the [[Comanche]] people at the end of the nineteenth century during a difficult transition period that took the [[Plains Indians]] from their classical age into a new era. A leader of the Quahada band that ranged over [[Llano Estacado]] and through its deep canyons on the southern [[Great Plains]], he was one of the last warriors to lead his people permanently to the reservation in [[Indian Territory]].\"<ref>Hagan, William T. ''Quanah Parker, Comanche Chief''. ''The Oklahoma Western Biographies''. p. 141. Norman and London: University of Oklahoma Press, 1993.</ref>\n\n* '''Cherokee Rolls, [[Dawes Commission]]'''\nAt the end of the book, Lucie returns to Oklahoma City and goes to the Oklahoma Historical Society room. She asks to see the Cherokee Rolls so she can look up her grandmother's father. The Dawes Rolls, also known as the \"Final Rolls\", are the lists of individuals who were accepted as eligible for tribal membership in the \"Five Civilized Tribes\": Cherokees, Creeks, Choctaws, Chickasaws, and Seminoles. (It does not include those whose applications were stricken, rejected or judged as doubtful.) Those found eligible for the Final Rolls were entitled to an allotment of land, usually as a homestead.<ref>The U.S. National Archives and Records Administration. https://www.archives.gov/genealogy/tutorial/dawes/#about Accessed 16 April 2008</ref>\n\n* '''[[Deer Woman]]'''\nWhen Lucie is at her mother's funeral, she sees three does. This alludes to the Cherokee story of the Deer Woman. \"The Deer Woman spirit teaches us that marriage and family life within the community are important and these relationships cannot be entered into lightly. Her tales are morality narratives: she teaches us that the misuse of sexual power is a transgression that will end in madness and death. The only way to save oneself from the magic of Deer Woman is to look to her feet, see her hooves, and recognize her for what she is. To know the story and act appropriately is to save oneself from a lifetime lived in pain and sorrow; to ignore the story is to continue in the death dance with Deer Woman.\"<ref>Dunn, Carolyn.

This piece of information is important because it helps to explain why Uncle Jerry talks to himself and to the radio. Gracie tells Lucie that the stress from the war caused Uncle Jerry to \"lose his piece of mind\" (90).\n\n* '''''Layers of Stories'''''\nThe cover of Bell's ''Faces in the Moon'' is an image of Connie Seaborn's 30\" X 22\" watercolor, ''Layers of Stories.'' It shows a woman holding up a child with a moon in the background. It is from the collection of Michael Hunt.<ref>Bell, Betty L. ''Faces in the Moon.''University of Oklahoma Press, 1994.</ref>\n\n*'''[[Tonto]]'''\nUncle Jerry make a brief reference to [[Tonto]] when he talks to Lucie about Indian names. Tonto was a Native American character on the television show ''[[The Lone Ranger (TV series)|The Lone Ranger]]''.\n\n==Literary Techniques==\n\n*'''Italicized Text'''\nBell uses italicized text liberally in ''Faces in the Moon''. The italicized portions of the book are dedicated to times of intense emotion rather than the facts that make up the backbone of the story. It is important to notice when Bell utilizes italics. She uses it in the horrendous rape scene between Lucie and J.D as well as in Lucie's dreams when she is running from the wild dogs. Changing from regular font to italicized font signals the reader to pay attention to the differences between the two. Bell uses italics to not only convey powerful feeling but also as an escape for Lucie. For example, when Lucie wants to hear her mother's words, she \u201chears\u201d them through the italicized text. However, she can also use the italicized words as a way to escape unpleasant feelings by dismissing them as dreams.\n\n*'''Language and Diction'''\nBell's choice of language and diction helps to form a story reminiscent of an oral narrative. Gracie and Rozella's conversation at the kitchen table is one of the best examples of this literary technique. Bell gives her characters certain attributes that allow readers to easily connect to the story. Rozella and Gracie talk over a cup of coffee and a cigarette. They use slang and other expressions that make them relatable to readers. This technique is so rampant throughout the novel that I have identified it as a theme. For more information on oral storytelling in ''Faces in the Moon'', please see the listing under Major Themes.\n\n==Criticism==\n\nLiterary critics have commented on both the novel's structure as well as thematic content of ''Faces in the Moon.'' Below are sections taken from published criticism.\n\n* In what seems to be an effort to capture the psychological processes of memory coupled with the dynamism of storytelling, the novel presents a series of non-chronological episodes conveyed through first- and third-person narrative perspectives. The text is frequently interrupted by italicized snippets of conversations, memories, dreams, and fanciful thoughts, all of which are presumably important aspects of Lucie's identity as it is being reconstructed; unfortunately, the relevance of these textual fragments is not always clear, and the structure of the novel alone is not enough to sustain the reader's interest in the fictional world. Characters who tell stories are expected, even welcome in a novel structured around the ritual of storytelling. However, so much exposition comes directly from the mouths of the characters, their conversations often appear implausible. Some characters seem to function merely as vehicles for imparting information, rather than interesting individuals with meaningful lives. In addition, an overreliance on trite and commonplace utterances seems an injustice to the uneducated, rural characters of the novel. Overall the narrative is hindered with explanation when drama is wanted. It is curious to note that the stories recast in the novel, stories that are central to the reconstruction of Lucie's identity, often conjure up the reified mythic image of the Native American. For example, reticence and pride, qualities that have been ascribed to the American Indian as invented by outside cultures, are given credence in such phrases as, \"that, my mother said, was the Indian in her\" (p.&nbsp;13). As a result, Lucie's remembering, or reconstruction of her Indian identity is tainted with a sense of falsehood, of the stereotypical. But more to the point, Lucie's self-discovery and reconciliation with the traditional past, her Cherokee heritage, is ultimately undermined by the ease with which it occurs. Never is it convincingly established that she has suffered estrangement from the world as a result of her childhood experiences; never is it established that her identity is in need of reconstruction, or rearticulation. It thus remains for Bell to create a cast of characters who are worthy of the thematic concerns evinced in ''Faces in the Moon''.<ref>Sanchez, Greg.\n''American Indian Quarterly'', Vol. 19, No. 2 (Spring, 1995), pp. 268-269. University of Nebraska Press, 1994</ref>\n\n* In time Lucie learned to communicate with nature and glimpsed the healing presence of the red earth of Oklahoma. Red, the color that symbolizes power and victory to the Cherokee, appears several times in association with Lizzie's home and in conjunction with Lucie's sickness. In a matter of a few pages red is revealed in bursts of color as a gift of a red jawbreaker, a red shawl, and in the repeated phrase \"To tsu hwa ha tlv we da\" (Redbird, where have you been?). In a dream image her grandmother healed Lucie, but as an adult Lucie states that she remained cut off from Oklahoma, the Cherokee people, and God. At first reading, the ending seems unnecessary and detracts from the book. However, after reflection, it clearly serves the important purpose of illustrating the continuing cycle of fear and abuse, as Lucie threatens \"a pink middle-aged man\" at the Oklahoma Historical Society. Lucie has suffered so much throughout her life but is now in a position of power to dish out the grief, as the cycle continues.<ref>Howard, Meredith.

University of Oklahoma, 1995.</ref>\n* Told largely in flashbacks by Lucie, who has returned home following her hated mother's stroke, the novel is elegantly written in spare prose replete with meaningful details and realistic dialogue. Bell, herself a Cherokee, deeply understands the culture she writes about and conveys that understanding unobtrusively, yet with great emotional power.<ref>''Publishers Weekly'' Vol. 241, No. 6 (Feb. 1994), p. 70.

Lucie returns to her mother's house when Gracie has fallen ill. While her mother is in the hospital, Lucie stays at Gracies house, and her memories take her back to different parts of her childhood. We are offered a glimpse into a very bleak reality. Lucie is required, at the age of four, to make breakfast for Gracie and her current boyfriend, J.D. One morning while Gracie is sleeping off the drinking from the previous night, J.D. begins to verbally abuse Lucie. He mimics her; he tells her shes trash and so is her mother. All of this is being said while the four-year-old makes him breakfast. After J.D. sexually molests her, Gracie decides to take Lucie to the farm to stay with Lizzie. Unaware of the abuse, she only sees that J.D. is upset with Lucies lack of respect for two years, and most of the novel takes place during this time. It is here that Lucie hears more stories of her heritage. Arriving a child wise beyond her years to the pain of the world, Lucie's time at the farm allows her to learn how to be a child, to play, to pretend.<ref>Voices from the Gaps: Women Artists and Writers of Color,\nAn International Website. \u00a92004 Regents of the University of Minnesota. http://voices.cla.umn.edu/vg/Critique/review_fiction/faces_in_the_moon_by_betty_louise_bell.html Accessed 20 April 2008.</ref>\n\nIt is Lizzie, a \"full-blooded\" woman, who mediates the young girl's relationship to the traditional past. Lizzie not only represents an alternative to Gracie's dissolute lifestyle, but she also helps preserve the history and meaning of the lives of the women in the family by telling and retelling stories imbued with what she thinks it means to be an Indian woman. Years later, when Gracie is hospitalized, Lucie returns to [[Oklahoma]], and with her return come the memories of childhood.<ref>Sanchez, Greg.\nAmerican Indian Quarterly, Vol. 19, No. 2 (Spring, 1995), pp. 268-269.

Helen spent much of her childhood with Lizzie, Emmie, and their mother. She is Gracie and Rozella's mother and Lucie's grandmother. She got pregnant by a [[Scottish people|Scotch]] preacher who left her after Rozella was born. Helen and her daughters lived in an abandoned car. She worked during The Great Depression in order to make a living for her family. Helen and Lucie are linked through their love of the story of Quanah Parker. The title of the book refers to Helen's face; Lucie, as a child and as an adult, comments that she sees Helen's face in the moon.\n* '''Gracie Evers'''- Gracie is Lucie's mother, Rozella's sister, Helen's daughter, and Lizzie's niece.

She is short and plump with a round face. In an important part of the novel, Aunt Bertha makes the comment, alluding to Lucie, that mixed bloods are beautiful people.\n*'''Melvin'''- Melvin is Lucie's ex-husband. He and his family did not respond kindly to Gracie when she came to Melvin and Lucie's wedding.\n*'''Emmie'''- Emmie is Lizzie's sister. Lizzie makes brief reference to her when she describes Helen to Lucie.\n\n==Major Themes==\n* '''Oral Storytelling'''\nOral storytelling is prevalent throughout ''Faces in the Moon''. Oral storytelling is very important in [[Cherokee]] culture because it is a communal activity. Gracie and Rozella sit around the kitchen table and tell stories. Lizzie tells stories to Lucie. Although Gracie constantly reminds readers that Lucie does not have a story, Lucie is in fact telling her own story through the novel. Lucie often complains that she is tired of living in the past through stories. However, she acknowledges their importance in her life and says, \"no matter how great my desire to run away from home, to live in a place and history free from secrets, I always take up my position at the table\" (5). The novel itself also sounds like the spoken word. Readers get the sense that they are listening in on a conversation, maybe even participating at times, rather than having limited participation as outsiders. The book is dense with women's voices. Perhaps this is Bell's way of giving agency back to women after their voices had been left out due to [[colonization]].\n\n* '''Identity Crisis'''\nThe best example of identity crisis can be seen through Lucie, the character representing the youngest generation. A cause of her identity crisis is through naming. As a child, she lived with an aunt who \u201cnever bothered with divorce, she simply lived in one married name until the opportunity for another came along\" (11). Not only was it her aunt that did this, but her mother switched names as well. Her mother and aunt constantly moving from man to man and name to name is consistent with how the Cherokee's culture was changing as a result of their removal. This leads Lucie to confusion, and she asks to be baptized as Antoinette. Since she is so young, one may think making up a name is childish play, but baptism is not usually an act taken lightly. It is also important to notice that neither Lucie nor the reader knows her last name, adding to her confused identity.\n\n* '''Confusion Regarding Cherokee Heritage'''\nBell makes her characters question their [[Cherokee]] heritage. Lucie can be seen as a victim of this confusion because she cannot relate to her non-native or her native side. Gracie and Auney send mixed signals by choosing \u201chigh heels over moccasins, blue eyes over black eyes\u201d (58). They alter their looks to seem less [[Cherokee]] but claim to be [[Cherokee]]. The women are also mixed bloods (Scotch and Cherokee). Because of the mixed signals from her relatives, Lucie struggles with the notion of whether she is Cherokee or not because she knows she too is of mixed blood and she has conflicting identities. To complicate things even further, she hears Reverend Tom Cottonmouth say, \u201cif youse got Cherokee blood a-running through your veins, no matter how distant, no matter how pre-e-e posterous, no matter how recent, the Cherokee loves y\u2019all\u201d(57). He makes a mockery of the Cherokee saying \u201cFor a ten dollar bill, no checks please, we\u2019ll send ya a authentic certificate of Cherokee blood. And wait Indian brothers and sisters, ifn ya do that \u2018fore midnight tonight, we\u2019ll send ya a genuine rock from the Cherokee nation\u201d(57). Reverend Cottonmouth's claim is so ridiculous that it makes being Cherokee seem accessible for everyone. It's like the ultimate slap on the face for true [[Cherokee]] who suffered through the [[Indian Removal]]. This leaves Lucie confused because there is nothing she can relate to.\n\n*'''Traditional vs. New'''\nThroughout the novel, Bell juxtaposes what it means to live closer to the traditional way of native life as compared to the new way. She uses Lizzie and Gracie as representations of the traditional and new way of life, respectively. She farms the same land that she has always lived on and refuses to accept the stolen goods from Gracie's current love interest. Lizzie shows power and strength as she deals with the terrible disease of tuberculosis. She also tells many stories to Lucie and encourages her to dream. Also, Lizzie and Uncle Jerry share the workload on the farm; this shows the importance of a balance of power between men and women and is another stark contrast to the patriarchal society of mainstream culture.\nWhereas Lizzie has retained her native qualities, Gracie has internalized mainstream white culture. Her hair is dyed an unnatural platinum blonde. She tried to dye Rozella's hair, and nearly burned it all off. She even shaved Lucie's eyebrows and lined her eyes with dark makeup. Instead of working for her food like Lizzie does, Gracie stores the stolen goods from J.D. and sometimes profits from them. Bell is not only critiquing the internalization of mainstream, white culture, but she is saying that this goes hand-in-hand with the unnatural. Lizzie is connected to nature whereas Gracie seems in a way, concerned only with the synthetic.\n\n* '''Generational Gap'''\nGracie and Auney's attempt to maintain [[Cherokee]] culture through storytelling roles has in a sense failed, or caused a gap, in generations because at this point, the [[Cherokee]] are so far removed from their original customs that the next generation (or Lucie) cannot identify with the stories. Lucie says on page 58 that she \u201cknew no Indian princesses, no buckskin, no feathers, no tomahawks.\u201d She goes on to say that she tried to see the women in her life as Indians but that she can\u2019t. Her lack of understanding the stories further complicates her identity as she has no first hand experience with tradition but at the same time is too far gone to get it back. Bell introduces a sense of worry in the text by making the reader question \u201cwell what is going to happen to the next generation?\u201d\n\n*'''Stability'''\nBell relates stability to both physical and psychological firmness and strength. She constructs characters that differ in their reactions to their [[Cherokee]] heritage in order to show that the strongest, most stable characters are those who do not run away from who they are. As a child and as an adult, Lucie struggles with the concept of her mixed blood heritage. She is connected to images of movement as she tries to figure out who she is. There is the image of physical movement as Lucie rides in her mother's car on the way to Lizzie's house. Lucie's physical movement is linked to psychological insecurity because she is unsure of what to expect. While at Lizzie's, Lucie comes down with an illness and has nights of restless sleep. In her dreams, she is running from wild dogs. She sees a native woman in the dream but cannot reach her. In the previous pages, Lucie and Lizzie were discussing why Lucie could not smile and wave to white men in the general store. When Lucie asked why she had to walk with her head down, Lizzie replied, \u201cYou\u2019re just different\u201d (107). Lucie's dream and the physical movement of running and reaching within it can be connected to a lack of psychological strength concerning who she is. Lucie tries to run and reach out to her native side, but her actions fall short because she does not understand what it means to be mixed blood, Cherokee, and/or \u201cdifferent.\u201d The movement continues into Lucie's adulthood; she moves to California to escape the psychological hardships of her life in Oklahoma. At the end of the novel, Lucie is at her mother's funeral and sees three does. Her moment of physical and psychological stability emerges when \u201ca stillness surrounded her, no leaf fluttered, and no bird sang, the earth paused waiting as I waited, giving up this moment to her peace\u201d (186).\n\n*'''Critique of Historical Documents'''\nThe United States Government told [[Cherokee]] Indians that they would get a certain amount of land in [[Indian Territory]]. However, many Cherokee did not understand the complicated diction that the officials used. Bell spends five and a half pages critiquing the historical documents related to these incidents. Colonel Needles asks Robert Evers, Helen's father, a list of questions regarding his family. Evers answers them to the best of his ability even when some are obviously meant to belittle the Cherokee. For example, the Colonel treats him like a suspect when he asks if he has ever discussed seceding from the Union. The Colonel's last question is intricately worded and ends with the agreement that Evers\u2019 land can be revoked at any time. Evers, not understand, replies with \u201cSir?\u201d. This scene represents how the government manipulated the Cherokee through complicated language and ultimately made it possible to legally strip them of their promised land. Bell also critiques Helen Evers\u2019 death certificate.  Both her date and place of birth is unknown. Her father's name is listed as \u201cnone.\u201d Bell expresses, through Lucie's viewpoint, the sickening feeling she gets when she reads this. Critiqing these documents also allows Bell to comment on how the Cherokee people are/were viewed as disposable and in some cases, nonexistent.\n\n==Historical, Cultural, and Artistic Allusions==\n* '''[[Quanah Parker]]'''\nLizzie tells Lucie a story about the mixed blood warrior, Quanah Parker. Later, Lucie dreams about him and wonders if she should tell her great aunt. When Gracie comes to visit, Lucie mentions that she has seen Quanah Parker. Lizzie warns the child of calling up spirits whereas Gracie laughs and calls it another one of Lizzie's stories. In history, Quanah Parker was an \"able metis chief of the [[Comanche]] people at the end of the nineteenth century during a difficult transition period that took the [[Plains Indians]] from their classical age into a new era. A leader of the Quahada band that ranged over [[Llano Estacado]] and through its deep canyons on the southern [[Great Plains]], he was one of the last warriors to lead his people permanently to the reservation in [[Indian Territory]].\"<ref>Hagan, William T. ''Quanah Parker, Comanche Chief''. ''The Oklahoma Western Biographies''. p. 141. Norman and London: University of Oklahoma Press, 1993.</ref>\n\n* '''Cherokee Rolls, [[Dawes Commission]]'''\nAt the end of the book, Lucie returns to Oklahoma City and goes to the Oklahoma Historical Society room. She asks to see the Cherokee Rolls so she can look up her grandmother's father. The Dawes Rolls, also known as the \"Final Rolls\", are the lists of individuals who were accepted as eligible for tribal membership in the \"Five Civilized Tribes\": Cherokees, Creeks, Choctaws, Chickasaws, and Seminoles. (It does not include those whose applications were stricken, rejected or judged as doubtful.) Those found eligible for the Final Rolls were entitled to an allotment of land, usually as a homestead.<ref>The U.S. National Archives and Records Administration. https://www.archives.gov/genealogy/tutorial/dawes/#about Accessed 16 April 2008</ref>\n\n* '''[[Deer Woman]]'''\nWhen Lucie is at her mother's funeral, she sees three does. This alludes to the Cherokee story of the Deer Woman. \"The Deer Woman spirit teaches us that marriage and family life within the community are important and these relationships cannot be entered into lightly. Her tales are morality narratives: she teaches us that the misuse of sexual power is a transgression that will end in madness and death. The only way to save oneself from the magic of Deer Woman is to look to her feet, see her hooves, and recognize her for what she is. To know the story and act appropriately is to save oneself from a lifetime lived in pain and sorrow; to ignore the story is to continue in the death dance with Deer Woman.\"<ref>Dunn, Carolyn.

This piece of information is important because it helps to explain why Uncle Jerry talks to himself and to the radio. Gracie tells Lucie that the stress from the war caused Uncle Jerry to \"lose his piece of mind\" (90).\n\n* '''''Layers of Stories'''''\nThe cover of Bell's ''Faces in the Moon'' is an image of Connie Seaborn's 30\" X 22\" watercolor, ''Layers of Stories.'' It shows a woman holding up a child with a moon in the background. It is from the collection of Michael Hunt.<ref>Bell, Betty L. ''Faces in the Moon.''University of Oklahoma Press, 1994.</ref>\n\n*'''[[Tonto]]'''\nUncle Jerry make a brief reference to [[Tonto]] when he talks to Lucie about Indian names. Tonto was a Native American character on the television show ''[[The Lone Ranger (TV series)|The Lone Ranger]]''.\n\n==Literary Techniques==\n\n*'''Italicized Text'''\nBell uses italicized text liberally in ''Faces in the Moon''. The italicized portions of the book are dedicated to times of intense emotion rather than the facts that make up the backbone of the story. It is important to notice when Bell utilizes italics. She uses it in the horrendous rape scene between Lucie and J.D as well as in Lucie's dreams when she is running from the wild dogs. Changing from regular font to italicized font signals the reader to pay attention to the differences between the two. Bell uses italics to not only convey powerful feeling but also as an escape for Lucie. For example, when Lucie wants to hear her mother's words, she \u201chears\u201d them through the italicized text. However, she can also use the italicized words as a way to escape unpleasant feelings by dismissing them as dreams.\n\n*'''Language and Diction'''\nBell's choice of language and diction helps to form a story reminiscent of an oral narrative. Gracie and Rozella's conversation at the kitchen table is one of the best examples of this literary technique. Bell gives her characters certain attributes that allow readers to easily connect to the story. Rozella and Gracie talk over a cup of coffee and a cigarette. They use slang and other expressions that make them relatable to readers. This technique is so rampant throughout the novel that I have identified it as a theme. For more information on oral storytelling in ''Faces in the Moon'', please see the listing under Major Themes.\n\n==Criticism==\n\nLiterary critics have commented on both the novel's structure as well as thematic content of ''Faces in the Moon.'' Below are sections taken from published criticism.\n\n* In what seems to be an effort to capture the psychological processes of memory coupled with the dynamism of storytelling, the novel presents a series of non-chronological episodes conveyed through first- and third-person narrative perspectives. The text is frequently interrupted by italicized snippets of conversations, memories, dreams, and fanciful thoughts, all of which are presumably important aspects of Lucie's identity as it is being reconstructed; unfortunately, the relevance of these textual fragments is not always clear, and the structure of the novel alone is not enough to sustain the reader's interest in the fictional world. Characters who tell stories are expected, even welcome in a novel structured around the ritual of storytelling. However, so much exposition comes directly from the mouths of the characters, their conversations often appear implausible. Some characters seem to function merely as vehicles for imparting information, rather than interesting individuals with meaningful lives. In addition, an overreliance on trite and commonplace utterances seems an injustice to the uneducated, rural characters of the novel. Overall the narrative is hindered with explanation when drama is wanted. It is curious to note that the stories recast in the novel, stories that are central to the reconstruction of Lucie's identity, often conjure up the reified mythic image of the Native American. For example, reticence and pride, qualities that have been ascribed to the American Indian as invented by outside cultures, are given credence in such phrases as, \"that, my mother said, was the Indian in her\" (p.&nbsp;13). As a result, Lucie's remembering, or reconstruction of her Indian identity is tainted with a sense of falsehood, of the stereotypical. But more to the point, Lucie's self-discovery and reconciliation with the traditional past, her Cherokee heritage, is ultimately undermined by the ease with which it occurs. Never is it convincingly established that she has suffered estrangement from the world as a result of her childhood experiences; never is it established that her identity is in need of reconstruction, or rearticulation. It thus remains for Bell to create a cast of characters who are worthy of the thematic concerns evinced in ''Faces in the Moon''.<ref>Sanchez, Greg.\n''American Indian Quarterly'', Vol. 19, No. 2 (Spring, 1995), pp. 268-269. University of Nebraska Press, 1994</ref>\n\n* In time Lucie learned to communicate with nature and glimpsed the healing presence of the red earth of Oklahoma. Red, the color that symbolizes power and victory to the Cherokee, appears several times in association with Lizzie's home and in conjunction with Lucie's sickness. In a matter of a few pages red is revealed in bursts of color as a gift of a red jawbreaker, a red shawl, and in the repeated phrase \"To tsu hwa ha tlv we da\" (Redbird, where have you been?). In a dream image her grandmother healed Lucie, but as an adult Lucie states that she remained cut off from Oklahoma, the Cherokee people, and God. At first reading, the ending seems unnecessary and detracts from the book. However, after reflection, it clearly serves the important purpose of illustrating the continuing cycle of fear and abuse, as Lucie threatens \"a pink middle-aged man\" at the Oklahoma Historical Society. Lucie has suffered so much throughout her life but is now in a position of power to dish out the grief, as the cycle continues.<ref>Howard, Meredith.

University of Oklahoma, 1995.</ref>\n* Told largely in flashbacks by Lucie, who has returned home following her hated mother's stroke, the novel is elegantly written in spare prose replete with meaningful details and realistic dialogue. Bell, herself a Cherokee, deeply understands the culture she writes about and conveys that understanding unobtrusively, yet with great emotional power.<ref>''Publishers Weekly'' Vol. 241, No. 6 (Feb. 1994), p. 70.

(retrieved 7 September 2010)</ref>]]\n'''Choctaw mythology''' is part of the culture of the [[Choctaw]], a [[Native Americans in the United States|Native American]] tribe originally occupying a large territory in the present-day [[Southeastern United States]]: much of the states of [[Mississippi]], [[Alabama]], and [[Louisiana]]. In the 19th century, the Choctaw were known to European Americans as one of the \"[[Five Civilized Tribes]].\" \n\nToday the Choctaw have three federally recognized tribes: the largest is the [[Choctaw Nation of Oklahoma]], next is the [[Mississippi Band of Choctaw Indians]], made up of descendants of individuals who did not remove in the 1830s, and the smallest is the [[Jena Band of Choctaw Indians]], located in Louisiana. In addition, the [[MOWA Band of Choctaw Indians]] is state-recognized by Alabama, but it has not achieved federal recognition. It, too, is made up of descendants of individuals who remained in the Southeast in the 1830s.\n\nThe Choctaw and their ancestors have lived in the Mississippi region for an estimated 4000 to 8000 years. Thousands of years of [[myth]] and story-making have contributed to a rich collection of history that spans the centuries. The Choctaw continue to tell and write about their legends based in the what is now known as the American [[Deep South]].\n\n==Choctaw creation==\n\n===First version===\n\nThe Choctaw who remain in [[Mississippi]] tell the following creation story of their coming to this land, and how [[Nanih Waiya]] Mound, built of earthwork by ancestors, came to be.\n\nTwo brothers, [[Choctaw|Chata]] and [[Chickasaw|Chicksah]], led the original people from a land in the far west that had ceased to prosper. The people traveled for a long time, guided by a [[Southeastern Ceremonial Complex#Cosmology|magical pole]] or staff. Each night, when the people stopped to camp, the pole was placed in the ground, and in the morning the people would travel in the direction in which the pole leaned.\n\nAfter traveling for an extremely long time, they finally came to a place where the pole remained upright. In this place, they laid to rest the bones of their ancestors, which they had carried in buffalo sacks from the original land in the west.\n-\u2026-\nThe earthwork [[Mound#North American archaeology|mound]] developed from that great burial. After the burial, the brothers discovered that the land could not support all the people. Chicksah took half the people and departed to the North, where they eventually emerged as the historic [[Chickasaw]] tribe.\n\nChatah and the others remained near the mound, which became known as Nanih Waiya, and became known as the [[Choctaw]].<ref>Taken from [http://www.indianlegend.com/choctaw/choctaw_001.htm Choctaw Creation Myth], Indian Legend website {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20130126045548/http://www.indianlegend.com/choctaw/choctaw_001.htm |date=26 January 2013 }} where it is listed as being in the public domain</ref>\n\n===Second version===\nAt the beginning there was a great mound. It was called [[Nanih Waiya]]. It was from this mound that the Creator fashioned the first of the people. These people crawled through a long, dark cave into daylight and became the first Choctaw.\n\n==Supernatural Native America==\n[[File:MacoocheeMoundEffigyPipe.png|thumb|Effigy pipe from the [[Nacoochee Mound]] in Georgia, U.S.A.]]\nSome early writers, and in later times Cushman and Bushnell, report that the Choctaw believed in a great good spirit and a great evil spirit. Choctaw oral histories mentioned numerous supernatural beings. In addition to their terms for what might also be called the Great Spirit or God and the Devil, the Choctaw believed they had many other \"powerful beings\" in their midst.\n\n==={{anchor|Hushtahli}} Ancient religion===\nThe [[Great Spirit]] of the Choctaw was referred to by various names. Rev. Alfred Wright wrote that the Great Spirit was referred to as ''Nanapesa,'' ''Ishtahullo-chito'', or ''Nanishta-hullo-chito,'' ''Hushtahli,'' and ''Uba P<u>i</u>ke'' or ''Aba.''<ref name=john_swanton>{{Google books|hSy7fZR5bQgC|Source Material for the Social and Ceremonial Life of the Choctaw Indians}}</ref><ref>Jobes, Gertrude. ''Dictionary of Mythology Folklore and Symbols''. New York: The Scarecrow Press, 1962.</ref> ''Shilup chitoh osh'' is a term anglicized to mean The Great Spirit. ''Chitokaka'' means The Great One. The terms ''lshtahullo'' or ''nanishtahullo'' are applied to anything or person thought to possess some occult or superior power - such as a witch.\n\n{{quote|Anthropologists theorize that the [[Mississippian culture|Mississippian]] ancestors of the Choctaw placed the sun at the center of their cosmological system. Mid-eighteenth-century Choctaws did view the sun as a being endowed with life. Choctaw diplomats, for example, spoke only on sunny days. If the day of a conference were cloudy or rainy, Choctaws delayed the meeting, usually on the pretext that they needed more time to discuss particulars, until the sun returned. The sun made sure that all talks were honest. The sun as a symbol of great power and reverence is a major component of southeastern Indian cultures.<!--|20px|20px|-->\n|2=Greg O'Brien |3=''Choctaws in a Revolutionary Age, 1750-1830''<ref name=greg_obrien>\n{{Cite book\n | last = O'Brien\n | first = Greg\n | title = Choctaws in a Revolutionary Age, 1750-1830\n | origyear = 2002, 2005\n | url =\n | access-date =\n | publisher = University of Nebraska Press\n | location =\n | chapter = Choctaw and Power\n | chapterurl =\n }}</ref>\n}}\n\n''Hushtahli'' is from ''Hashi'' (sun) and ''Tahli'' (to complete an action). ''Hushtahli'' is believed to have originated as a Choctaw term without European influence; the Choctaw were believed to be sun worshippers. Fire was the \"most striking representation of the sun\"; it was believed to have intelligence, and was considered to be in constant communication with the sun.\n\n===Interactions between animals and people===\n{{Expand Section|date=April 2013}}\n{{Unreferenced section|date=April 2013}}\n[[File:Chromesun moundville stone palette01.jpg|right|thumb|225px|A digital graphic based on a ceremonial stone palette found at the [[Moundville Archaeological Site]] in [[Moundville, Alabama]]]]\nThe Choctaw venerated ''[[Sinti lapitta]]'', a horned serpent that visited unusually wise young men.<ref>{{cite web|last=Alchin|first=Linda|title=Horned Serpent Symbol|url=http://www.warpaths2peacepipes.com/native-american-symbols/horned-serpent-symbol.htm|work=Native Indian Tribes|access-date=2 November 2013|quote=[...] The Choctaw tribe honored a spirit called 'Sinti lapitta' who was a horned serpent which visited exceptionally wise young men.

In both beliefs, the Great Serpent was a water monster with great power. [...]}}</ref>\n\n===Little people and other human-like creatures===\nThey believed in a little man, about two feet high, who dwelled alone in the thick, dark woods. The little man was called ''Bohpoli'' or ''Kowi anukasha'', both names being used alone or together. The translation of ''Bohpoli'' is the \"Thrower\". The translation of ''Kowi anuskasha ''is \"The one who stays in the woods\", or to give a more concise translation, \"Forest dweller\". Little man can be compared to the European counterparts- [[dwarf (mythology)|dwarf]]s, [[Elf|elves]], [[gnome]]s, and [[leprechaun]]s.\n\nThe little wood sprite (''ole'') was known to be rather mischievous, but not malicious. The Choctaw believed that he often playfully threw sticks and stones at them. All unexplained sounds heard in the woods were attributed to Bohpoli. The Choctaw believed that he took a special pleasure in hitting the pine trees to create noise.\n\nBohpoli was never seen by the common Choctaw, only by the prophets and shaman. The Indian shamans or doctors would report that Bohpoli assisted them in creating their medicines. Some stories said that  Bohpoli would \"steal\" little children and take them into the woods, to teach them about herbs and medicines. After returning the children to their homes, Bohpoli would leave them alone, letting them grow up to become doctors of the tribe.\n\nSome of the history writings refer to ''Kashehotapalo'', a combination of man and deer who delighted in frightening hunters. He was much admired for his speed and agility. If the Choctaw angered ''Kashehotapalo'', he would race ahead of them and warn the enemy or animals being hunted.\n\n''Okwa Naholo'' or ''Oka Nahullo'' (white people of the water) dwelled in deep pools and had light skins like the skins of trout. They were believed to sometimes capture human beings, whom they converted into beings like themselves.\n\n''Hoklonote'' was a bad spirit who could assume any shape it desired; it was believed to read people's thoughts.\n\n===Shadow-like beings===\nThe Choctaw have stories about [[Shadow people|shadow beings]]. ''Nalusa Chito'', also known as a ''Impa Shilup'', was the soul-eater, a great black being.<ref name=john_swanton /> If individuals allowed evil thoughts or depression to enter their minds, Impa Shilup would creep inside them and eat their souls. Many people of Choctaw Nation will not say his name, in fear of summoning the spirit.\n\n''Nalusa Falaya'' (long black being) resembled a man, but with very small eyes and long, pointed ears. He sometimes frightened hunters or transferred his power of doing harm. Some believed that ''Nalusa Falaya'' preferred to approach men by sliding on his stomach like a snake.\n\n''Hashok Okwa Hui'ga'' (Grass Water Drop) was believed to have a connection to what is termed [[will-o-the-wisp]]. Only its heart is visible, and that only at night. ''Hashok Okwa Hui'ga'' leads astray anyone who looks at it.\n\nIt was also believed that every man had a ''shilombish'' (the outside shadow) which always followed him, and ''shilup'' (the inside shadow, or ghost) which after death goes to the land of ghosts. The ''shilombish'' was supposed to remain upon the earth, and wander restlessly about its former home, often moaning, to frighten its surviving friends. It tried to make them forsake the spot, and seek another place to live. It was also supposed to assume the form of a fox, or owl; and by barking like the one, and screeching like the other at night, cause great consternation, for the cry was considered ominous of bad things. The Choctaw could differentiate between the ''shilombish'' and the animals it imitates. When a fox barks, or an owl screeches, another fox or owl replies. But when the ''shilombish'' imitates the sound of either animal, no response is heard. The shadow-like beings would often stalk children of younger adult age.\n\nThe ''Kashehotapolo'' is a creature that is neither man nor beast. While having the legs and hoofs of a deer, its body is that of a man. His head and face are small and shriveled, and it is said that a person who looks at it will be visited by evil. When hunters go near the swamps it inhabits, it sneaks behind them to call loudly before quickly fleeing. Although it does not harm man, it takes delight in their fright as it yells a sound that resembles a woman\u2019s scream. For that reason it was named ''Kashehotapolo'' (''kashesho'', \u201cwoman\u201d; ''tapalo'', \u201ccall\u201d).<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite book|title=Native American Legends\u202f: Southeastern Legends--Tales from the Natchez, Caddo, Biloxi, Chickasaw, and Other Nations|last=Lankford|first=George|publisher=August House|year=1987|isbn=|location=Little Rock|pages=}}</ref>\n\n===Birds of the dark===\n''Ishkitini'', or the [[horned owl]], was believed to prowl about at night killing men and animals. Many believed that when ''ishkitini'' screeched, it meant sudden death, such as a murder. If the ''ofunlo'' ([[screech owl]]) was heard, it was a sign that a child under seven in the family was going to die. Such a child was likened to a small owl. If ''opa'' (a common owl) perched in a barn or on trees near the house and hooted, its call was a foreboding of death among the near relatives of the residents.\n\n''Biskinik'', the [[sapsucker]], was known as the newsbird. If he landed on a tree in a family's yard early in the morning, some \"hasty\" news would come before noon. If he perched there late at night, the news would come before morning.\n\n===Animal-explained occurrences===\nAnimals figure significantly in Choctaw mythology, as they do in most [[Native Americans in the United States|Native American]] myth cycles. For example, in Choctaw history, [[solar eclipse]]s were attributed to black squirrels, and [[maize]] was a gift from the birds.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n''Heloha'' (thunder) and ''Melatha'' (lightning) were responsible for the dramatic thunderstorms. In Choctaw mythology, they were two huge [[Thunderbird (mythology)|birds]]. ''Heloha'' would lay her giant eggs in the clouds, and they would rumble as they rolled around atop the clouds. Despite his size, her mate, ''Melatha'', was extremely fast and left a trail of sparks as he streaked across the sky.\n\n== Mythological tales ==\n\n=== Origin of Poison ===\nIn a shallow pool of water where the Choctaw people would bathe, there was a poison vine. All that would touch the vine would die. The vine liked the Choctaw people and did not want them to die, but could not warn them when its poison would infect the water. It decided to rid itself of its poison and called the chiefs of the snakes, bees, and wasps because they had all been trampled on and accidentally killed by the men. The chiefs of these small creatures came to an agreement to take and share the vine\u2019s poison among themselves as a warning and deterrent against being trampled.\n\nThe bees were the first to take the poison, and said that they will take a small amount so as to protect their hives. They too liked the Choctaw people and did not want to kill them with the poison. To show that they were not man's enemy, the bees promised that, after they had been forced to use their stinger, they would die. \n\nThe next to take the poison were the wasps, who said they would buzz in the ear of man as a warning before they attacked to protect their nests.\n\nFinally, the snakes took the rest of the poison. They promised that they would always warn man with their rattle before they strike, in order to give the man a chance to flee.\n\nFrom then on, it was only the foolish persons who did not heed the warnings of the small, who were hurt from the vine\u2019s poison.<ref name=\":0\" /><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.firstpeople.us/FP-Html-Legends/HowPoisonCameIntoTheWorld-Choctaw.html|title=How Poison came into the World - A Choctaw Legend|website=www.firstpeople.us|access-date=2019-04-14}}</ref>\n\n=== Brothers Tashka and Walo ===\nTwo brothers named Tashka and Walo followed the sun for many years from childhood to adulthood. They would follow it throughout its life in the day, until it died over the horizon in the evening. One day, the sun rested over a great expanse of water, and the boys swam into it, going underneath.\n\nThey emerged in the home of the sun, finding women all around. These women were the moon and the stars. The moon was the sun\u2019s wife and asked the brothers how they entered this realm. The brothers said that they followed the sun for many years since they were boys. The sun then told his wife to boil water, and he placed the brothers in it, keeping them there until their skin fell off. The sun asked if they knew their way back home. The boys replied \"no\", as they looked over the edge of the sky, seeing land, but were not able to discern their home from such a height.\n\nThe sun asked why they had followed him for all these years, to which the brothers replied only to see where he had died. The sun agreed to send them home, but instructed them not to talk for four days after they returned, or they would surely die. He called a giant buzzard to fly them home, and after they had landed, an old man recognized them and went to tell their mother. The mother, frightened since she had not seen them for many days, made them tell her where they had been.

Many years passed -- the young men became old and the old men died -- and people continued to talk about him. He finally returned, as an old man, with the answer to this question.

Storytelling can be difficult if someone is not sharing the same accurate information. Storytelling is important to the Choctaw Nation and many other Indigenous groups because the person sharing the story helps the younger generation understand their history and people. If the story is told inaccurately, it will lose its value. Storytelling is very beneficial in the Choctaw Nation to share Choctaw legacies because it helps people get a better understanding of their culture. \n\nFor example, before the creation of a written language, history was established by sacred myths, legend, and personal reminiscences. These sacred myths were the record of the history of the Choctaw and many other Indigenous groups, as they were for other cultures around the world. During these sacred stories and myths, names were mentioned, but dates were hardly included. An example was Choctaw Chief [[Pushmataha]]. While he is known to have lived from 1764-1824, the stories told about him emphasize his character and the influence he had on people's lives. They are stories told by family members to others close to them. If accounts are told by people outside his circle, the stories lose their passion. \n\n==See also==\n* [[Creek mythology]]\n* [[Green Corn Ceremony]]\n* [[Stomp dance]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* [http://www.indigenouspeople.net/spider.htm Grandmother Spider Steals Fire] - creation myth of the Choctaw People of Tennessee and Mississippi\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20060413192858/http://www.tc.umn.edu/~mboucher/mikebouchweb/choctaw/legends2.htm Choctaw legends and stories]\n* [https://archive.is/20130126045548/http://www.indianlegend.com/choctaw/choctaw_001.htm Choctaw Creation Myth]\n*[http://www.bigfootencounters.com/legends/shampe.htm Shampe (Bigfoot like creature)]\n*http://www.native-languages.org/choctaw-legends.htm\n\n{{Choctaw}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Choctaw Mythology}}\n[[Category:Choctaw culture]]\n[[Category:Creation myths]]\n[[Category:Mythologies of the indigenous peoples of North America]]\n", "text_old": "{{Use dmy dates|date=July 2013}}\n[[File:Choctaw group.png|325px|thumb|Mississippi Choctaw in traditional clothing, ca. 1908]]\n[[File:Choctaw Eagle Dance.jpg|thumb|325px|''Eagle Dance, Choctaw'', painted by [[George Catlin]] near [[Fort Gibson, Oklahoma]], 1835-1837<ref>[http://americanart.si.edu/luce/object.cfm?key=338&artistmedia=0&subkey=678 \"Eagle Dance, Choctaw.\"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120922011434/http://americanart.si.edu/luce/object.cfm?key=338&artistmedia=0&subkey=678 |date=22 September 2012 }} ''Luce Foundation for American Art.'' (retrieved 7 September 2010)</ref>]]\n'''Choctaw mythology''' is part of the culture of the [[Choctaw]], a [[Native Americans in the United States|Native American]] tribe originally occupying a large territory in the present-day [[Southeastern United States]]: much of the states of [[Mississippi]], [[Alabama]], and [[Louisiana]]. In the 19th century, the Choctaw were known to European Americans as one of the \"[[Five Civilized Tribes]].\" \n\nToday the Choctaw have three federally recognized tribes: the largest is the [[Choctaw Nation of Oklahoma]], next is the [[Mississippi Band of Choctaw Indians]], made up of descendants of individuals who did not remove in the 1830s, and the smallest is the [[Jena Band of Choctaw Indians]], located in Louisiana. In addition, the [[MOWA Band of Choctaw Indians]] is state-recognized by Alabama, but it has not achieved federal recognition. It, too, is made up of descendants of individuals who remained in the Southeast in the 1830s.\n\nThe Choctaw and their ancestors have lived in the Mississippi region for an estimated 4000 to 8000 years. Thousands of years of [[myth]] and story-making have contributed to a rich collection of history that spans the centuries. The Choctaw continue to tell and write about their legends based in the what is now known as the American [[Deep South]].\n\n==Choctaw creation==\n\n===First version===\n\nThe Choctaw who remain in [[Mississippi]] tell the following creation story of their coming to this land, and how [[Nanih Waiya]] Mound, built of earthwork by ancestors, came to be.\n\nTwo brothers, [[Choctaw|Chata]] and [[Chickasaw|Chicksah]], led the original people from a land in the far west that had ceased to prosper. The people traveled for a long time, guided by a [[Southeastern Ceremonial Complex#Cosmology|magical pole]] or staff. Each night, when the people stopped to camp, the pole was placed in the ground, and in the morning the people would travel in the direction in which the pole leaned.\n\nAfter traveling for an extremely long time, they finally came to a place where the pole remained upright. In this place, they laid to rest the bones of their ancestors, which they had carried in buffalo sacks from the original land in the west.\n\nThe earthwork [[Mound#North American archaeology|mound]] developed from that great burial. After the burial, the brothers discovered that the land could not support all the people. Chicksah took half the people and departed to the North, where they eventually emerged as the historic [[Chickasaw]] tribe.\n\nChatah and the others remained near the mound, which became known as Nanih Waiya, and became known as the [[Choctaw]].<ref>Taken from [http://www.indianlegend.com/choctaw/choctaw_001.htm Choctaw Creation Myth], Indian Legend website {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20130126045548/http://www.indianlegend.com/choctaw/choctaw_001.htm |date=26 January 2013 }} where it is listed as being in the public domain</ref>\n\n===Second version===\nAt the beginning there was a great mound. It was called [[Nanih Waiya]]. It was from this mound that the Creator fashioned the first of the people. These people crawled through a long, dark cave into daylight and became the first Choctaw.\n\n==Supernatural Native America==\n[[File:MacoocheeMoundEffigyPipe.png|thumb|Effigy pipe from the [[Nacoochee Mound]] in Georgia, U.S.A.]]\nSome early writers, and in later times Cushman and Bushnell, report that the Choctaw believed in a great good spirit and a great evil spirit. Choctaw oral histories mentioned numerous supernatural beings. In addition to their terms for what might also be called the Great Spirit or God and the Devil, the Choctaw believed they had many other \"powerful beings\" in their midst.\n\n==={{anchor|Hushtahli}} Ancient religion===\nThe [[Great Spirit]] of the Choctaw was referred to by various names. Rev. Alfred Wright wrote that the Great Spirit was referred to as ''Nanapesa,'' ''Ishtahullo-chito'', or ''Nanishta-hullo-chito,'' ''Hushtahli,'' and ''Uba P<u>i</u>ke'' or ''Aba.''<ref name=john_swanton>{{Google books|hSy7fZR5bQgC|Source Material for the Social and Ceremonial Life of the Choctaw Indians}}</ref><ref>Jobes, Gertrude. ''Dictionary of Mythology Folklore and Symbols''. New York: The Scarecrow Press, 1962.</ref> ''Shilup chitoh osh'' is a term anglicized to mean The Great Spirit. ''Chitokaka'' means The Great One. The terms ''lshtahullo'' or ''nanishtahullo'' are applied to anything or person thought to possess some occult or superior power - such as a witch.\n\n{{quote|Anthropologists theorize that the [[Mississippian culture|Mississippian]] ancestors of the Choctaw placed the sun at the center of their cosmological system. Mid-eighteenth-century Choctaws did view the sun as a being endowed with life. Choctaw diplomats, for example, spoke only on sunny days. If the day of a conference were cloudy or rainy, Choctaws delayed the meeting, usually on the pretext that they needed more time to discuss particulars, until the sun returned. The sun made sure that all talks were honest. The sun as a symbol of great power and reverence is a major component of southeastern Indian cultures.<!--|20px|20px|-->\n|2=Greg O'Brien |3=''Choctaws in a Revolutionary Age, 1750-1830''<ref name=greg_obrien>\n{{Cite book\n | last = O'Brien\n | first = Greg\n | title = Choctaws in a Revolutionary Age, 1750-1830\n | origyear = 2002, 2005\n | url =\n | access-date =\n | publisher = University of Nebraska Press\n | location =\n | chapter = Choctaw and Power\n | chapterurl =\n }}</ref>\n}}\n\n''Hushtahli'' is from ''Hashi'' (sun) and ''Tahli'' (to complete an action). ''Hushtahli'' is believed to have originated as a Choctaw term without European influence; the Choctaw were believed to be sun worshippers. Fire was the \"most striking representation of the sun\"; it was believed to have intelligence, and was considered to be in constant communication with the sun.\n\n===Interactions between animals and people===\n{{Expand Section|date=April 2013}}\n{{Unreferenced section|date=April 2013}}\n[[File:Chromesun moundville stone palette01.jpg|right|thumb|225px|A digital graphic based on a ceremonial stone palette found at the [[Moundville Archaeological Site]] in [[Moundville, Alabama]]]]\nThe Choctaw venerated ''[[Sinti lapitta]]'', a horned serpent that visited unusually wise young men.<ref>{{cite web|last=Alchin|first=Linda|title=Horned Serpent Symbol|url=http://www.warpaths2peacepipes.com/native-american-symbols/horned-serpent-symbol.htm|work=Native Indian Tribes|access-date=2 November 2013|quote=[...] The Choctaw tribe honored a spirit called 'Sinti lapitta' who was a horned serpent which visited exceptionally wise young men.

[...]}}</ref>\n\n===Little people and other human-like creatures===\nThey believed in a little man, about two feet high, who dwelled alone in the thick, dark woods. The little man was called ''Bohpoli'' or ''Kowi anukasha'', both names being used alone or together. The translation of ''Bohpoli'' is the \"Thrower\". The translation of ''Kowi anuskasha ''is \"The one who stays in the woods\", or to give a more concise translation, \"Forest dweller\". Little man can be compared to the European counterparts- [[dwarf (mythology)|dwarf]]s, [[Elf|elves]], [[gnome]]s, and [[leprechaun]]s.\n\nThe little wood sprite (''ole'') was known to be rather mischievous, but not malicious. The Choctaw believed that he often playfully threw sticks and stones at them. All unexplained sounds heard in the woods were attributed to Bohpoli. The Choctaw believed that he took a special pleasure in hitting the pine trees to create noise.\n\nBohpoli was never seen by the common Choctaw, only by the prophets and shaman. The Indian shamans or doctors would report that Bohpoli assisted them in creating their medicines. Some stories said that  Bohpoli would \"steal\" little children and take them into the woods, to teach them about herbs and medicines. After returning the children to their homes, Bohpoli would leave them alone, letting them grow up to become doctors of the tribe.\n\nSome of the history writings refer to ''Kashehotapalo'', a combination of man and deer who delighted in frightening hunters. He was much admired for his speed and agility. If the Choctaw angered ''Kashehotapalo'', he would race ahead of them and warn the enemy or animals being hunted.\n\n''Okwa Naholo'' or ''Oka Nahullo'' (white people of the water) dwelled in deep pools and had light skins like the skins of trout. They were believed to sometimes capture human beings, whom they converted into beings like themselves.\n\n''Hoklonote'' was a bad spirit who could assume any shape it desired; it was believed to read people's thoughts.\n\n===Shadow-like beings===\nThe Choctaw have stories about [[Shadow people|shadow beings]]. ''Nalusa Chito'', also known as a ''Impa Shilup'', was the soul-eater, a great black being.<ref name=john_swanton /> If individuals allowed evil thoughts or depression to enter their minds, Impa Shilup would creep inside them and eat their souls. Many people of Choctaw Nation will not say his name, in fear of summoning the spirit.\n\n''Nalusa Falaya'' (long black being) resembled a man, but with very small eyes and long, pointed ears. He sometimes frightened hunters or transferred his power of doing harm. Some believed that ''Nalusa Falaya'' preferred to approach men by sliding on his stomach like a snake.\n\n''Hashok Okwa Hui'ga'' (Grass Water Drop) was believed to have a connection to what is termed [[will-o-the-wisp]]. Only its heart is visible, and that only at night. ''Hashok Okwa Hui'ga'' leads astray anyone who looks at it.\n\nIt was also believed that every man had a ''shilombish'' (the outside shadow) which always followed him, and ''shilup'' (the inside shadow, or ghost) which after death goes to the land of ghosts. The ''shilombish'' was supposed to remain upon the earth, and wander restlessly about its former home, often moaning, to frighten its surviving friends. It tried to make them forsake the spot, and seek another place to live. It was also supposed to assume the form of a fox, or owl; and by barking like the one, and screeching like the other at night, cause great consternation, for the cry was considered ominous of bad things. The Choctaw could differentiate between the ''shilombish'' and the animals it imitates. When a fox barks, or an owl screeches, another fox or owl replies. But when the ''shilombish'' imitates the sound of either animal, no response is heard. The shadow-like beings would often stalk children of younger adult age.\n\nThe ''Kashehotapolo'' is a creature that is neither man nor beast. While having the legs and hoofs of a deer, its body is that of a man. His head and face are small and shriveled, and it is said that a person who looks at it will be visited by evil. When hunters go near the swamps it inhabits, it sneaks behind them to call loudly before quickly fleeing. Although it does not harm man, it takes delight in their fright as it yells a sound that resembles a woman\u2019s scream. For that reason it was named ''Kashehotapolo'' (''kashesho'', \u201cwoman\u201d; ''tapalo'', \u201ccall\u201d).<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite book|title=Native American Legends\u202f: Southeastern Legends--Tales from the Natchez, Caddo, Biloxi, Chickasaw, and Other Nations|last=Lankford|first=George|publisher=August House|year=1987|isbn=|location=Little Rock|pages=}}</ref>\n\n===Birds of the dark===\n''Ishkitini'', or the [[horned owl]], was believed to prowl about at night killing men and animals. Many believed that when ''ishkitini'' screeched, it meant sudden death, such as a murder. If the ''ofunlo'' ([[screech owl]]) was heard, it was a sign that a child under seven in the family was going to die. Such a child was likened to a small owl. If ''opa'' (a common owl) perched in a barn or on trees near the house and hooted, its call was a foreboding of death among the near relatives of the residents.\n\n''Biskinik'', the [[sapsucker]], was known as the newsbird. If he landed on a tree in a family's yard early in the morning, some \"hasty\" news would come before noon. If he perched there late at night, the news would come before morning.\n\n===Animal-explained occurrences===\nAnimals figure significantly in Choctaw mythology, as they do in most [[Native Americans in the United States|Native American]] myth cycles. For example, in Choctaw history, [[solar eclipse]]s were attributed to black squirrels, and [[maize]] was a gift from the birds.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n''Heloha'' (thunder) and ''Melatha'' (lightning) were responsible for the dramatic thunderstorms. In Choctaw mythology, they were two huge [[Thunderbird (mythology)|birds]]. ''Heloha'' would lay her giant eggs in the clouds, and they would rumble as they rolled around atop the clouds. Despite his size, her mate, ''Melatha'', was extremely fast and left a trail of sparks as he streaked across the sky.\n\n== Mythological tales ==\n\n=== Origin of Poison ===\nIn a shallow pool of water where the Choctaw people would bathe, there was a poison vine. All that would touch the vine would die. The vine liked the Choctaw people and did not want them to die, but could not warn them when its poison would infect the water. It decided to rid itself of its poison and called the chiefs of the snakes, bees, and wasps because they had all been trampled on and accidentally killed by the men. The chiefs of these small creatures came to an agreement to take and share the vine\u2019s poison among themselves as a warning and deterrent against being trampled.\n\nThe bees were the first to take the poison, and said that they will take a small amount so as to protect their hives. They too liked the Choctaw people and did not want to kill them with the poison. To show that they were not man's enemy, the bees promised that, after they had been forced to use their stinger, they would die. \n\nThe next to take the poison were the wasps, who said they would buzz in the ear of man as a warning before they attacked to protect their nests.\n\nFinally, the snakes took the rest of the poison. They promised that they would always warn man with their rattle before they strike, in order to give the man a chance to flee.\n\nFrom then on, it was only the foolish persons who did not heed the warnings of the small, who were hurt from the vine\u2019s poison.<ref name=\":0\" /><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.firstpeople.us/FP-Html-Legends/HowPoisonCameIntoTheWorld-Choctaw.html|title=How Poison came into the World - A Choctaw Legend|website=www.firstpeople.us|access-date=2019-04-14}}</ref>\n\n=== Brothers Tashka and Walo ===\nTwo brothers named Tashka and Walo followed the sun for many years from childhood to adulthood. They would follow it throughout its life in the day, until it died over the horizon in the evening. One day, the sun rested over a great expanse of water, and the boys swam into it, going underneath.\n\nThey emerged in the home of the sun, finding women all around. These women were the moon and the stars. The moon was the sun\u2019s wife and asked the brothers how they entered this realm. The brothers said that they followed the sun for many years since they were boys. The sun then told his wife to boil water, and he placed the brothers in it, keeping them there until their skin fell off. The sun asked if they knew their way back home. The boys replied \"no\", as they looked over the edge of the sky, seeing land, but were not able to discern their home from such a height.\n\nThe sun asked why they had followed him for all these years, to which the brothers replied only to see where he had died. The sun agreed to send them home, but instructed them not to talk for four days after they returned, or they would surely die. He called a giant buzzard to fly them home, and after they had landed, an old man recognized them and went to tell their mother. The mother, frightened since she had not seen them for many days, made them tell her where they had been. They told her of their journey and said that they will now surely die because they did not keep their promise to the sun of silence for four days.\n\nAfter this the mother was very worried, but they all returned home. The brothers told the tales of the many years they had followed the sun.
