The Terrapins compete in the [[NCAA Division I Football Bowl Subdivision]] (FBS) and the [[Big Ten Conference]]. The Terrapins joined the Big Ten Conference on July 1, 2014, following 62 years in the [[Atlantic Coast Conference]] as a founding member. [[Mike Locksley]] is the head coach.\n\nSince 1950, the Terrapins have played their home games at [[Maryland Stadium]] in [[College Park, Maryland]] with occasional home games from time to time in [[Baltimore]], making them one of two FBS football teams in the [[Baltimore\u2013Washington metropolitan area]] ([[Navy Midshipmen]]) and the closest [[Football Bowl Subdivision]] team to Washington, D.C. The team's official colors of red, white, black, and gold have been in use in some combination since the 1920s and are taken from [[Flag of Maryland|Maryland's state flag]], and the Terrapins nickname \u2014 often abbreviated as \"Terps\" \u2014 was adopted in 1933 after [[diamondback terrapin|a turtle species]] native to the state. Maryland shares storied rivalries with [[Maryland\u2013Virginia football rivalry|Virginia]] and [[Maryland\u2013West Virginia football rivalry|West Virginia]].\n\nThe program's achievements have included one [[NCAA Division I FBS National Football Championship|national championship]],<ref name=\"ncaa.org\"/> nine [[List of Atlantic Coast Conference football champions|ACC championships]], two [[List of Southern Conference football champions|Southern Conference championships]], 11 consensus [[List of Maryland Terrapins football All-Americans|All-Americans]], several [[List of Maryland Terrapins football honorees#Hall of Fame inductees|Hall of Fame inductees]], and 24 bowl game appearances.

{"title_page": "Yan Tan Tethera", "text_new": "{{about|the counting system|the opera|Yan Tan Tethera (opera)}}\n{{Refimprove|date=November 2009}}\n\n'''Yan Tan Tethera''' is a sheep-counting rhyme/system traditionally used by [[shepherd]]s in [[Northern England]] and earlier in some other parts of Britain.<ref>{{cite book|title=Cultural Evolution|first=Kate |last=Distin|year=2010 |publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0-521-18971-2|page=93}}</ref> Until the [[Industrial Revolution]], the use of traditional number systems was common among shepherds, especially in the [[fells]] of the [[Lake District]]. The ''Yan Tan Tethera'' system was also used for counting stitches in knitting. The words derive from a [[Brythonic languages|Brythonic Celtic]] language. Though most of these number systems fell out of use by 1910, some are still in use. \n\nThe word ''yan'' or ''yen'' for \"one\" in some northern English [[dialect]]s generally represents a regular development in [[Northern England English|Northern English]] in which the [[Old English]] long vowel {{IPA|/\u0251\u02d0/}} <\u0101> was broken into /ie/, /ia/ and so on. This explains the shift to ''yan'' and ''ane'' from the Old English ''\u0101n'', which is itself derived from the [[Proto-Germanic language|Proto-Germanic]] ''*ainaz''.<ref>{{cite book |first=Dick |last=Leith |title=A Social History of English |year=1997 |publisher=Routledge |isbn=0-415-09797-5 |page=45}} (Alternate {{ISBN| 978-0-415-09797-0}})</ref><ref>{{cite book |first=Bill |last=Griffiths |authorlink=Bill Griffiths (poet)  |title=A Dictionary of North East Dialect |year=2004 |publisher=Northumbria University Press |isbn=1-904794-16-5 |page=191}}</ref> Another example of this development is the Northern English word for \"home\", ''hame'', which has forms such as ''hyem, yem'' and ''yam'' all deriving from the Old English ''h\u0101m''.<ref>{{cite book |first=Bill |last=Griffiths |title=A Dictionary of North East Dialect |year=2004 |publisher=Northumbria University Press |isbn=1-904794-16-5 |page=79}}</ref>\n\n== Importance of keeping count ==\nIn order to keep accurate records (e.g. of birth and death) and to be alert to instances of straying, shepherds must perform frequent head-counts of their flocks. Dating back at least to the [[Middle Ages|medieval]] period, and continuing to the present in some areas like [[Slaidburn]], farms were granted [[Fell farming|fell rights]], allowing them access to common grazing land. To prevent [[overgrazing]], it was vitally important for each farm to keep accurate, updated head-counts.\n\nThough fell rights are largely obsolete in modern agriculture except in upland areas, farms are often [[subsidy|subsidised]] and [[taxation|taxed]] according to the quantity of their sheep. For this reason, accurate counts are still necessary, and must be performed frequently.\n\nGenerally, a count is the first action performed in the morning and the last action performed at night. A count is made after moving the sheep from one pasture to another, and after any operation involving the sheep, such as [[sheep shearing|shearing]], [[Ear tag|tagging]], foot-trimming, [[mulesing]], etc., although sheep are far less likely to stray while being moved in a group than when grazing at large on open ground.\n\n== Origin and usage ==\n\nSheep-counting systems ultimately derive from [[Brythonic languages|Brythonic]] [[Celtic languages]], such as [[Cumbric language|Cumbric]]; Tim Gay writes: \u201c[Sheep-counting systems from all over the British Isles] all compared very closely to 18th-century [[Cornish language|Cornish]] and modern [[Welsh language|Welsh]]\".<ref>{{cite journal |last=Gay |first=Tim |title=Rural dialects and surviving Britons |url=https://reader.exacteditions.com/magazines/1291/search?q=yan |journal=[[British Archaeology]] |date=July 1999|issue=46 |url-access=subscription |page=18}}</ref> It is impossible, given the corrupted form in which they have survived, to be sure of their exact origin. The counting systems have changed considerably over time.  A particularly common tendency is for certain pairs of adjacent numbers to come to resemble each other by [[rhyme]] (notably the words for 1 and 2, 3 and 4, 6 and 7, or 8 and 9). Still, multiples of five tend to be fairly conservative; compare ''bumfit'' with Welsh ''pymtheg'', in contrast with standard English ''fifteen''.\n\nLike most Celtic numbering systems, they tend to be [[vigesimal]] ([[radix|based]] on the number twenty), but they usually lack words to describe quantities larger than twenty; though this is not a limitation of either modernised decimal Celtic counting systems or the older ones. To count a large number of sheep, a shepherd would repeatedly count to twenty, placing a mark on the ground, or move his hand to another mark on his crook, or drop a pebble into his pocket to represent each [[20 (number)|score]] (e.g. 5 score sheep = 100 sheep).\n\nTheir use is also attested in a knitting song from Yorkshire.<ref>{{cite journal |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=40wAAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA205 |journal=[[Notes and Queries]] |title=Knitting Song |author=R.

"text_old": "{{about|the counting system|the opera|Yan Tan Tethera (opera)}}\n{{Refimprove|date=November 2009}}\n\n'''Yan Tan Tethera''' is a sheep-counting rhyme/system traditionally used by [[shepherd]]s in [[Northern England]] and earlier in some other parts of Britain.<ref>{{cite book|title=Cultural Evolution|first=Kate |last=Distin|year=2010 |publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0-521-18971-2|page=93}}</ref> Until the [[Industrial Revolution]], the use of traditional number systems was common among shepherds, especially in the [[fells]] of the [[Lake District]]. The ''Yan Tan Tethera'' system was also used for counting stitches in knitting. The words derive from a [[Brythonic languages|Brythonic Celtic]] language. Though most of these number systems fell out of use by 1910, some are still in use. \n\nThe word ''yan'' or ''yen'' for \"one\" in some northern English [[dialect]]s generally represents a regular development in [[Northern England English|Northern English]] in which the [[Old English]] long vowel {{IPA|/\u0251\u02d0/}} <\u0101> was broken into /ie/, /ia/ and so on. This explains the shift to ''yan'' and ''ane'' from the Old English ''\u0101n'', which is itself derived from the [[Proto-Germanic language|Proto-Germanic]] ''*ainaz''.<ref>{{cite book |first=Dick |last=Leith |title=A Social History of English |year=1997 |publisher=Routledge |isbn=0-415-09797-5 |page=45}} (Alternate {{ISBN| 978-0-415-09797-0}})</ref><ref>{{cite book |first=Bill |last=Griffiths |authorlink=Bill Griffiths (poet)  |title=A Dictionary of North East Dialect |year=2004 |publisher=Northumbria University Press |isbn=1-904794-16-5 |page=191}}</ref> Another example of this development is the Northern English word for \"home\", ''hame'', which has forms such as ''hyem, yem'' and ''yam'' all deriving from the Old English ''h\u0101m''.<ref>{{cite book |first=Bill |last=Griffiths |title=A Dictionary of North East Dialect |year=2004 |publisher=Northumbria University Press |isbn=1-904794-16-5 |page=79}}</ref>\n\n== Importance of keeping count ==\nIn order to keep accurate records (e.g. of birth and death) and to be alert to instances of straying, shepherds must perform frequent head-counts of their flocks. Dating back at least to the [[Middle Ages|medieval]] period, and continuing to the present in some areas like [[Slaidburn]], farms were granted [[Fell farming|fell rights]], allowing them access to common grazing land. To prevent [[overgrazing]], it was vitally important for each farm to keep accurate, updated head-counts.\n\nThough fell rights are largely obsolete in modern agriculture except in upland areas, farms are often [[subsidy|subsidised]] and [[taxation|taxed]] according to the quantity of their sheep. For this reason, accurate counts are still necessary, and must be performed frequently.\n\nGenerally, a count is the first action performed in the morning and the last action performed at night. A count is made after moving the sheep from one pasture to another, and after any operation involving the sheep, such as [[sheep shearing|shearing]], [[Ear tag|tagging]], foot-trimming, [[mulesing]], etc., although sheep are far less likely to stray while being moved in a group than when grazing at large on open ground.\n\n== Origin and usage ==\n\nSheep-counting systems ultimately derive from [[Brythonic languages|Brythonic]] [[Celtic languages]], such as [[Cumbric language|Cumbric]]; Tim Gay writes: \u201c[Sheep-counting systems from all over the British Isles] all compared very closely to 18th-century [[Cornish language|Cornish]] and modern [[Welsh language|Welsh]]\".<ref>{{cite journal |last=Gay |first=Tim |title=Rural dialects and surviving Britons |url=https://reader.exacteditions.com/magazines/1291/search?q=yan |journal=[[British Archaeology]] |date=July 1999|issue=46 |url-access=subscription |page=18}}</ref> It is impossible, given the corrupted form in which they have survived, to be sure of their exact origin. The counting systems have changed considerably over time.  A particularly common tendency is for certain pairs of adjacent numbers to come to resemble each other by [[rhyme]] (notably the words for 1 and 2, 3 and 4, 6 and 7, or 8 and 9). Still, multiples of five tend to be fairly conservative; compare ''bumfit'' with Welsh ''pymtheg'', in contrast with standard English ''fifteen''.\n\nLike most Celtic numbering systems, they tend to be [[vigesimal]] ([[radix|based]] on the number [[20 (number)|twenty]]), but they usually lack words to describe quantities larger than twenty; though this is not a limitation of either modernised decimal Celtic counting systems or the older ones. To count a large number of sheep, a shepherd would repeatedly count to twenty, placing a mark on the ground, or move his hand to another mark on his crook, or drop a pebble into his pocket to represent each [[20 (number)|score]] (e.g. 5 score sheep = 100 sheep).\n\nTheir use is also attested in a knitting song from Yorkshire.<ref>{{cite journal |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=40wAAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA205 |journal=[[Notes and Queries]] |title=Knitting Song |author=R. S.

The message which the founders of these religions brought was, therefore, essentially the same as that of Islam, albeit incomplete.

However, the global conveyance, recognition and eventual acceptance of his message (i.e. the perfection of the ''manifestation'' of Muhammad's prophethood) was destined to occur with the coming of the [[Mahdi]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.alislam.org/quran/tafseer/?page=2739&region=E1&CR=EN,E2 |title=The Holy Quran |publisher=Alislam.org |accessdate=13 August 2011 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110725000651/http://www.alislam.org/quran/tafseer/?page=2739&region=E1&CR=EN%2CE2 |archivedate=25 July 2011 |url-status=live }}</ref> Thus, Ahmadi Muslims regard [[Mirza Ghulam Ahmad]] as that Mahdi and, by extension, the \"Promised One\" of all religions fulfilling eschatological prophecies found in the scriptures of the [[Abrahamic religions]], as well as [[Zoroastrianism]], the [[Indian religions]], [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Native American traditions]] and others.<ref name=\"ita_4\">Invitation to Ahmadiyyat by Mirza Bashir-ud-Din Mahmood Ahmad Part II, Argument 4, Chapter \"Promised Messiah, Promised One of All Religions\"</ref> Ahmadi Muslims believe that Ahmad was divinely commissioned as a true reflection of Muhammad's prophethood to establish the unity of God and to remind mankind of their duties towards God and His creation.<ref>{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/?id=Q78O1mjX2tMC&printsec=frontcover&dq=simon+ross+valentine+ahmadiyya#v=onepage | title=Islam and the Ahmadiyya jama\u02bbat: history, belief, practice | pages=32\u201333 | author=Simon Ross Valentine | publisher=Columbia University Press | isbn=978-0-231-70094-8 | year=2008 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.alislam.org/library/articles/2007WCJSSpeech_20071228.pdf | title=Raising Ahmadi Children in the West | author=Nasir Mahmood Malik | publisher=Al Islam | accessdate=10 June 2011 | year=2007}}</ref> Summarising the Islamic faith, Ahmad writes:\n\n{{Quote|There are only two complete parts of faith.

Acknowledgement of this principle is the most important and the cardinal principle of Islam as interpreted by the Community. All other Islamic beliefs spring from this belief. The belief in the Unity of God is thought to influence a person's life in all its aspects and is believed to have much wider meaning and deeper applications. For example, elaborating on the Oneness of God, the Quranic verse \"There is no all-encompassing power except God\" is believed to negate all forms of fear with the exception of the fear of God. It instills a sense of complete dependence on God and that every good emanates from Him. In general, the belief in unity of God is thought to liberate believers from all forms of carnal passions, slavery and perceptions of earthly imprisonment. The founder of the Community writes:\n{{quote|The Unity of God is a light which illumines the heart only after the negation of all deities, whether they belong to the inner world or the outer world. It permeates every particle of man's being. How can this be acquired without the aid of God and His Messenger? The duty of man is only to bring death upon his ego and turn his back to devilish pride. He should not boast of his having been reared in the cradle of knowledge but should consider himself as if he were merely an ignorant person, and occupy himself in supplications. Then the light of Unity will descend upon him from God and will bestow new life upon Him.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.alislam.org/allah/roohani%20khazain.html |title=Mirza Ghulam Ahmad on the Unity of Allah |publisher=Al Islam |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140703080224/http://www.alislam.org/allah/roohani%20khazain.html |archivedate=3 July 2014 |df=dmy-all }}</ref>}} It is further believed that the Islamic concept of Oneness of God inculcates the realization of the Oneness of the human species and thus removes all impediments in this regard. The diversity of all human races, ethnicities and colours are considered worthy of acceptance. Moreover, it is thought that a belief in the Unity of God creates a sense of absolute harmony between the Creator and the creation. It is understood that there can be no contradiction between the ''word of God'' and ''work of God''.<ref name=\"welcome_54\">{{cite book | url=http://www.alislam.org/books/ahmadiyyat/WelcomeBook2ndEd.pdf | title=Welcome to Ahmadiyyat, the True Islam | page=54 | publisher=Islami International Publications}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.alislam.org/allah/ |title=Allah |publisher=Alislam.org |accessdate=13 August 2011 | archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20110725000636/http://www.alislam.org/allah/ | archivedate= 25 July 2011 | url-status= live}}</ref>\n\nIslam recognises God as the fountain-head of all excellences, free from all imperfection as understood by the Community. God is recognised as a Living God who manifests himself everywhere and listens to the prayers of his servants. Distinctively, however, Ahmadi Muslims recognise that the attributes of God are eternal. On account of this, Ahmadi teachings propound the view that God communicates with mankind as he did before.\n\n===Angels===\n{{Main|Islamic view of angels}}\nThe belief in angels is fundamental to the Ahmadiyya Muslim Community. They are spiritual beings created by God to obey him and implement his commandments. Unlike human beings, angels have no free will and cannot act independently. Under God's command, they bring revelations to the Prophets, bring punishment on the Prophets' enemies, glorify God with his praise, and keep records of human beings' deeds. Angels are not visible to the physical eye. Yet, according to the Ahmadiyya Muslim Community, they do sometimes appear to man in one form or another. This appearance, however, is not physical but a spiritual manifestation.<ref name=\"welcome_64\">{{cite book | url=http://www.alislam.org/books/ahmadiyyat/WelcomeBook2ndEd.pdf | title=Welcome to Ahmadiyyat, the True Islam | page=64 | publisher=Islam International Publications}}</ref> Ahmadi Muslims regards angels as celestial beings who have their own entity as persons. The major role they play is the transmission of messages from God to human beings. According to the Quran, the entire material universe as well as the religious universe is governed by some spiritual powers, which are referred to as angels. Whatever they do is in complete submission to the Will of God and the design that he created for things. According to Islam, as interpreted by Ahmadi Muslims, they cannot deviate from the set course or functions allocated to them, or from the overall plan of things made by God.<ref name=\"welcome_65\">{{cite book | url=http://www.alislam.org/books/ahmadiyyat/WelcomeBook2ndEd.pdf | title=Welcome to Ahmadiyyat, the True Islam | page=65 | publisher=Islam International Publications}}</ref>\n\n===Books===\n{{Main|Islamic holy books}}\n[[File:Einige Koran \u00dcbersetzungen der Ahmadiyya.JPG|right|thumb|Some of the many [[Quran translations]] by Ahmadi translators at the 2009 [[Frankfurt Book Fair]]]]\nFor Ahmadi Muslims, the third article in Islam is concerned with the belief in all the divine scriptures as revealed by God to his Prophets. This includes, the [[Torah]], the [[Gospel (Islam)|Gospel]], the [[Zabur|Psalms]], the [[scrolls of Abraham|scrolls]] of Abraham, and the [[Quran]]. Before the advent of Islam, the history of religion is understood as a series of dispensations where each messenger brought teachings suitable for the time and place. Thus, at the time of their inception, the divine teachings sent by God concurred in their fundamentals, with the exception of minor details that were chosen to complement the time and place. With the exception of the Quran, it is believed that the divine scriptures are susceptible to human interpolation. Islam recognises that God sent his prophets to every nation and isolated communities of the world. Thus, according to the Ahmadi teachings, books outside of the Abrahamic tradition, such as the [[Vedas]] and [[Avesta]] are too considered as being of divine origin.

Ahmadi Muslims believe that when the world is filled with unrighteousness and immorality, or when a specific part of the world displays these attributes, or when the followers of a certain law (religion) become corrupt or incorporate [[Bid\u2018ah|corrupted teachings]] into the faith, thus making the faith obsolete or in need of a Divine Sustainer, then a Prophet of God is sent to re-establish His Divine Will. Aside from the belief in all prophets in the Quran and the Old Testament, the Community also regards [[Zoroaster]], [[Krishna]], [[Gautama Buddha|Buddha]], [[Confucius]] as prophets.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.alislam.org/books/truth/finality.html |title=Finality of Prophet hood &#124; Hadhrat Muhammad (PUBH) the Last Prophet \u2013 Al Islam Online |publisher=Alislam.org |date=29 November 1966 |accessdate=13 August 2011| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20110724234544/http://www.alislam.org/books/truth/finality.html | archivedate= 24 July 2011 | url-status= live}}</ref>{{Failed verification |date=May 2017 |reason=failed to find \"other prophets\"; please review [[Special:Diff/624147438]]}}\n\nAccording to the Ahmadiyya belief, the technical Islamic terms \"warner\" (''natheer''), \"prophet\" (''nabi''), \"messenger\" (''rasul'') and \"envoy\" (''mursal'') are synonymous in meaning. However, there are two kinds of prophethood as understood by the Community: Law-bearing prophets, who bring a new law and dispensation, such as [[Moses]] (given the [[Torah]]) and [[Muhammad]] (given the [[Quran]]); and non-law-bearing prophets, who appear within a given dispensation such as [[Jeremiah]], [[Jesus]] and [[Mirza Ghulam Ahmad]]. [[Adam]] is regarded as the first human with whom God spoke and revealed to him his divine will and thus the first prophet, but is not regarded as the first human on earth by the Ahmadiyya Muslim Community, contrary to mainstream Islamic, Jewish and Christian beliefs.

The Caliph's [[Jumu'ah|Friday Sermon]] is televised live throughout the world, via [[Muslim Television Ahmadiyya International|MTA]] TV]]\nAhmadi Muslims believe that the [[Khalifatul Masih|Ahmadiyya caliphate]] is the resumption of the [[Rightly Guided Caliph]]ate. This is believed to have been re-established with the appearance of Mirza Ghulam Ahmad whom Ahmadis believe was the promised [[Messiah]] and [[Mahdi]]. Ahmadi Muslims maintain that in accordance with Quranic verses (such as {{Cite quran|24|55}}) and numerous [[Hadith]] on the issue, ''Khil\u0101fah'' or the Caliphate can only be established by God Himself and is a divine blessing given to ''those who believe and work righteousness'' and uphold the unity of God. Therefore, any movement to establish the Caliphate centred around human endeavours alone is bound to fail, particularly when the condition of the people diverges from the ''precepts of prophethood'' and they are as a result disunited, their inability to elect a caliph caused fundamentally by the lack of righteousness in them. It is believed that through visions, dreams and spiritual guidance, God instils into the hearts and minds of the believers of whom to elect. No campaigning, speeches or speculation of any kind are permitted. Thus the caliph is designated neither necessarily by right (i.e. the rightful or competent one in the eyes of the people) nor merely by election but primarily by God.<ref>{{cite book | url=https://archive.org/details/holyquranwitheng0003unse/page/1870 | title=The Holy Quran with English Translation and Commentary | place=Surrey | publisher=Islam International Publications | page=[https://archive.org/details/holyquranwitheng0003unse/page/1870 1870] | isbn=1-85372-045-3 }}</ref>\n\nAccording to Ahmadiyya thought, it is not essential for a caliph to be the head of a state, rather the spiritual and religious significance of the Caliphate is emphasised. It is above all a spiritual office, with the purpose to uphold, strengthen, spread the teachings of Islam and maintain the high spiritual and moral standards within the global community established by [[Muhammad]]. If a caliph does happen to bear governmental authority as a head of state, it is incidental and subsidiary in relation to his overall function as a caliph.<ref>{{cite book | url=http://www.alislam.org/library/books/Khilafat-e-Rashida.pdf | title=Khilafat-e-Rashidah | author=Mirza Basheer-ud-Din Mahmood Ahmad | author-link=Mirza Basheer-ud-Din Mahmood Ahmad | publisher=Islam International Publications | isbn=1-85372-620-6}}</ref><ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.alislam.org/egazette/updates/the-islamic-khilafat-its-rise-fall-and-re-emergence/ | title=The Islamic Khilafat \u2013 Its Rise, Fall, and Re-emergence | author=Rafi Ahmad| date=3 March 2011 }}</ref> The caliph is also referred to by Ahmadi Muslims as [[Amir al-Mu'minin]] (Leader of the Faithful).

It was established in 1922 by the second caliph, [[Mirza Basheer-ud-Din Mahmood Ahmad]]. This advisory body meets formally at least once a year. At the international level, the council is presided over by the caliph. Its main purpose is to advise the caliph on important matters such as finance, projects, education and other issues relating to members of the Community. It is required for the caliph to carry out his duties through consultation, taking into consideration the views of the members of the council. However, it is not incumbent upon him to always accept the views and recommendations of the members. The caliph may comment, issue instructions, announce his decisions on the proposals during the course of the proceedings or may postpone the matter under further reflection. However, in most cases the caliph accepts the advice given by the majority. At the national level, the council is presided over by the ''\u02be[[Emir|Am\u012br]]'' (National President). At the conclusion of the proceedings, the recommendations are sent to the caliph for approval which he may accept, reject or partially accept.<ref>{{cite book | url=http://www.alislam.org/books/ahmadiyyat/WelcomeBook2ndEd.pdf | title=Welcome to Ahmadiyyat, the true Islam | publisher=Islam International Publications | pages=318\u2013324 | accessdate=24 August 2014}}</ref>\n\n===The Headquarters===\n[[File:Fazl-Moschee 2010.jpg|right|thumb|[[Fazl Mosque, London|The Fazl Mosque]], the first mosque in [[London]], represents the current world headquarters of the Ahmadiyya Muslim Community]]\nThe principal headquarters of the Ahmadiyya Muslim Community is the city, town or place where the caliph resides.

However, the global conveyance, recognition and eventual acceptance of his message (i.e. the perfection of the ''manifestation'' of Muhammad's prophethood) was destined to occur with the coming of the [[Mahdi]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.alislam.org/quran/tafseer/?page=2739&region=E1&CR=EN,E2 |title=The Holy Quran |publisher=Alislam.org |accessdate=13 August 2011 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110725000651/http://www.alislam.org/quran/tafseer/?page=2739&region=E1&CR=EN%2CE2 |archivedate=25 July 2011 |url-status=live }}</ref> Thus, Ahmadi Muslims regard [[Mirza Ghulam Ahmad]] as that Mahdi and, by extension, the \"Promised One\" of all religions fulfilling eschatological prophecies found in the scriptures of the [[Abrahamic religions]], as well as [[Zoroastrianism]], the [[Indian religions]], [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Native American traditions]] and others.<ref name=\"ita_4\">Invitation to Ahmadiyyat by Mirza Bashir-ud-Din Mahmood Ahmad Part II, Argument 4, Chapter \"Promised Messiah, Promised One of All Religions\"</ref> Ahmadi Muslims believe that Ahmad was divinely commissioned as a true reflection of Muhammad's prophethood to establish the unity of God and to remind mankind of their duties towards God and His creation.<ref>{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/?id=Q78O1mjX2tMC&printsec=frontcover&dq=simon+ross+valentine+ahmadiyya#v=onepage | title=Islam and the Ahmadiyya jama\u02bbat: history, belief, practice | pages=32\u201333 | author=Simon Ross Valentine | publisher=Columbia University Press | isbn=978-0-231-70094-8 | year=2008 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.alislam.org/library/articles/2007WCJSSpeech_20071228.pdf | title=Raising Ahmadi Children in the West | author=Nasir Mahmood Malik | publisher=Al Islam | accessdate=10 June 2011 | year=2007}}</ref> Summarising the Islamic faith, Ahmad writes:\n\n{{Quote|There are only two complete parts of faith.

Acknowledgement of this principle is the most important and the cardinal principle of Islam as interpreted by the Community. All other Islamic beliefs spring from this belief. The belief in the Unity of God is thought to influence a person's life in all its aspects and is believed to have much wider meaning and deeper applications. For example, elaborating on the Oneness of God, the Quranic verse \"There is no all-encompassing power except God\" is believed to negate all forms of fear with the exception of the fear of God. It instills a sense of complete dependence on God and that every good emanates from Him. In general, the belief in unity of God is thought to liberate believers from all forms of carnal passions, slavery and perceptions of earthly imprisonment. The founder of the Community writes:\n{{quote|The Unity of God is a light which illumines the heart only after the negation of all deities, whether they belong to the inner world or the outer world. It permeates every particle of man's being. How can this be acquired without the aid of God and His Messenger? The duty of man is only to bring death upon his ego and turn his back to devilish pride. He should not boast of his having been reared in the cradle of knowledge but should consider himself as if he were merely an ignorant person, and occupy himself in supplications. Then the light of Unity will descend upon him from God and will bestow new life upon Him.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.alislam.org/allah/roohani%20khazain.html |title=Mirza Ghulam Ahmad on the Unity of Allah |publisher=Al Islam |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140703080224/http://www.alislam.org/allah/roohani%20khazain.html |archivedate=3 July 2014 |df=dmy-all }}</ref>}} It is further believed that the Islamic concept of Oneness of God inculcates the realization of the Oneness of the human species and thus removes all impediments in this regard. The diversity of all human races, ethnicities and colours are considered worthy of acceptance. Moreover, it is thought that a belief in the Unity of God creates a sense of absolute harmony between the Creator and the creation. It is understood that there can be no contradiction between the ''word of God'' and ''work of God''.<ref name=\"welcome_54\">{{cite book | url=http://www.alislam.org/books/ahmadiyyat/WelcomeBook2ndEd.pdf | title=Welcome to Ahmadiyyat, the True Islam | page=54 | publisher=Islami International Publications}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.alislam.org/allah/ |title=Allah |publisher=Alislam.org |accessdate=13 August 2011 | archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20110725000636/http://www.alislam.org/allah/ | archivedate= 25 July 2011 | url-status= live}}</ref>\n\nIslam recognises God as the fountain-head of all excellences, free from all imperfection as understood by the Community. God is recognised as a Living God who manifests himself everywhere and listens to the prayers of his servants. Distinctively, however, Ahmadi Muslims recognise that the attributes of God are eternal. On account of this, Ahmadi teachings propound the view that God communicates with mankind as he did before.\n\n===Angels===\n{{Main|Islamic view of angels}}\nThe belief in angels is fundamental to the Ahmadiyya Muslim Community. They are spiritual beings created by God to obey him and implement his commandments. Unlike human beings, angels have no free will and cannot act independently. Under God's command, they bring revelations to the Prophets, bring punishment on the Prophets' enemies, glorify God with his praise, and keep records of human beings' deeds. Angels are not visible to the physical eye. Yet, according to the Ahmadiyya Muslim Community, they do sometimes appear to man in one form or another. This appearance, however, is not physical but a spiritual manifestation.<ref name=\"welcome_64\">{{cite book | url=http://www.alislam.org/books/ahmadiyyat/WelcomeBook2ndEd.pdf | title=Welcome to Ahmadiyyat, the True Islam | page=64 | publisher=Islam International Publications}}</ref> Ahmadi Muslims regards angels as celestial beings who have their own entity as persons. The major role they play is the transmission of messages from God to human beings. According to the Quran, the entire material universe as well as the religious universe is governed by some spiritual powers, which are referred to as angels. Whatever they do is in complete submission to the Will of God and the design that he created for things. According to Islam, as interpreted by Ahmadi Muslims, they cannot deviate from the set course or functions allocated to them, or from the overall plan of things made by God.<ref name=\"welcome_65\">{{cite book | url=http://www.alislam.org/books/ahmadiyyat/WelcomeBook2ndEd.pdf | title=Welcome to Ahmadiyyat, the True Islam | page=65 | publisher=Islam International Publications}}</ref>\n\n===Books===\n{{Main|Islamic holy books}}\n[[File:Einige Koran \u00dcbersetzungen der Ahmadiyya.JPG|right|thumb|Some of the many [[Quran translations]] by Ahmadi translators at the 2009 [[Frankfurt Book Fair]]]]\nFor Ahmadi Muslims, the third article in Islam is concerned with the belief in all the divine scriptures as revealed by God to his Prophets. This includes, the [[Torah]], the [[Gospel (Islam)|Gospel]], the [[Zabur|Psalms]], the [[scrolls of Abraham|scrolls]] of Abraham, and the [[Quran]]. Before the advent of Islam, the history of religion is understood as a series of dispensations where each messenger brought teachings suitable for the time and place. Thus, at the time of their inception, the divine teachings sent by God concurred in their fundamentals, with the exception of minor details that were chosen to complement the time and place. With the exception of the Quran, it is believed that the divine scriptures are susceptible to human interpolation. Islam recognises that God sent his prophets to every nation and isolated communities of the world. Thus, according to the Ahmadi teachings, books outside of the Abrahamic tradition, such as the [[Vedas]] and [[Avesta]] are too considered as being of divine origin. Among the recognised books, the Community believes that the Quran is the final divine scripture revealed by God to mankind. The teachings of the Quran are considered timeless.<ref name=\"knowledge_34\">\"A Book of Religious Knowledge\" by Waheed Ahmad, pg. 34</ref>\n\n===Prophets===\n{{Main|Prophets in Islam| Prophethood (Ahmadiyya)|Khatam an-Nabiyyin}}\nAccording to the Ahmadi Muslim view, the fourth article of faith in Islam is concerned with the belief in all divine prophets sent by God. Ahmadi Muslims believe that when the world is filled with unrighteousness and immorality, or when a specific part of the world displays these attributes, or when the followers of a certain law (religion) become corrupt or incorporate [[Bid\u2018ah|corrupted teachings]] into the faith, thus making the faith obsolete or in need of a Divine Sustainer, then a Prophet of God is sent to re-establish His Divine Will. Aside from the belief in all prophets in the Quran and the Old Testament, the Community also regards [[Zoroaster]], [[Krishna]], [[Gautama Buddha|Buddha]], [[Confucius]] as prophets.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.alislam.org/books/truth/finality.html |title=Finality of Prophet hood &#124; Hadhrat Muhammad (PUBH) the Last Prophet \u2013 Al Islam Online |publisher=Alislam.org |date=29 November 1966 |accessdate=13 August 2011| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20110724234544/http://www.alislam.org/books/truth/finality.html | archivedate= 24 July 2011 | url-status= live}}</ref>{{Failed verification |date=May 2017 |reason=failed to find \"other prophets\"; please review [[Special:Diff/624147438]]}}\n\nAccording to the Ahmadiyya belief, the technical Islamic terms \"warner\" (''natheer''), \"prophet\" (''nabi''), \"messenger\" (''rasul'') and \"envoy\" (''mursal'') are synonymous in meaning. However, there are two kinds of prophethood as understood by the Community: Law-bearing prophets, who bring a new law and dispensation, such as [[Moses]] (given the [[Torah]]) and [[Muhammad]] (given the [[Quran]]); and non-law-bearing prophets, who appear within a given dispensation such as [[Jeremiah]], [[Jesus]] and [[Mirza Ghulam Ahmad]]. [[Adam]] is regarded as the first human with whom God spoke and revealed to him his divine will and thus the first prophet, but is not regarded as the first human on earth by the Ahmadiyya Muslim Community, contrary to mainstream Islamic, Jewish and Christian beliefs. This view is based on the [[Quran]] itself, according to the Ahmadiyya Muslim Community.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.alislam.org/library/links/00000179.html |title=Man Lived on Earth Even Before the Advent of Adam |publisher=Alislam.org |date= 16 February 2000 |accessdate=18 June 2012}}</ref> Ahmadis believe Muhammad to be the final law-bearing prophet but teach the continuity of prophethood.\n\n===Day of Judgement===\n{{Main|Qiyamat}}\nThe fifth article of faith relates to the Day of Judgment.<ref name=\"tti_72\">{{cite book | url=http://www.alislam.org/books/ahmadiyyat/WelcomeBook2ndEd.pdf | title=Welcome to Ahmadiyyat, The True Islam | page=72 | publisher=Islam International Publications}}</ref> According to the Ahmadis, after belief in one God, belief in the [[Day of Judgement]] is the most emphasized doctrine mentioned in the Quran.<ref name=\"tti_72\" /> According to Ahmadi Muslim beliefs, the entire universe will come to an end on the Day of Judgment, a position also taken by all other Islamic sects and schools of thought. The dead will be resurrected and accounts will be taken of their deeds. People with good records will enter into Heaven while those with bad records will be thrown into Hell.<ref name=\"tti_72\" /> Hell is understood in Ahmadiyya as a temporary abode, lasting an extremely long time but not everlasting, much like in mainstream [[Judaism]].

Ahmadis believe that science is the study of the acts of God and religion is the study of the word of God and the two cannot possibly contradict each other.

He established the organizational structure of the Community and directed extensive missionary activity outside the subcontinent of India. Several weeks following his election, delegates from all over India were invited to [[Majlis-ash-Shura|discuss]] about propagation of Islam. Two decades later, Mahmood Ahmad launched a twofold scheme for the establishment of foreign missions and the moral upbringing of Ahmadi Muslims.

The Caliph's [[Jumu'ah|Friday Sermon]] is televised live throughout the world, via [[Muslim Television Ahmadiyya International|MTA]] TV]]\nAhmadi Muslims believe that the [[Khalifatul Masih|Ahmadiyya caliphate]] is the resumption of the [[Rightly Guided Caliph]]ate. This is believed to have been re-established with the appearance of Mirza Ghulam Ahmad whom Ahmadis believe was the promised [[Messiah]] and [[Mahdi]]. Ahmadi Muslims maintain that in accordance with Quranic verses (such as {{Cite quran|24|55}}) and numerous [[Hadith]] on the issue, ''Khil\u0101fah'' or the Caliphate can only be established by God Himself and is a divine blessing given to ''those who believe and work righteousness'' and uphold the unity of God. Therefore, any movement to establish the Caliphate centred around human endeavours alone is bound to fail, particularly when the condition of the people diverges from the ''precepts of prophethood'' and they are as a result disunited, their inability to elect a caliph caused fundamentally by the lack of righteousness in them. It is believed that through visions, dreams and spiritual guidance, God instils into the hearts and minds of the believers of whom to elect. No campaigning, speeches or speculation of any kind are permitted. Thus the caliph is designated neither necessarily by right (i.e. the rightful or competent one in the eyes of the people) nor merely by election but primarily by God.<ref>{{cite book | url=https://archive.org/details/holyquranwitheng0003unse/page/1870 | title=The Holy Quran with English Translation and Commentary | place=Surrey | publisher=Islam International Publications | page=[https://archive.org/details/holyquranwitheng0003unse/page/1870 1870] | isbn=1-85372-045-3 }}</ref>\n\nAccording to Ahmadiyya thought, it is not essential for a caliph to be the head of a state, rather the spiritual and religious significance of the Caliphate is emphasised. It is above all a spiritual office, with the purpose to uphold, strengthen, spread the teachings of Islam and maintain the high spiritual and moral standards within the global community established by [[Muhammad]].

At the international level, the council is presided over by the caliph. Its main purpose is to advise the caliph on important matters such as finance, projects, education and other issues relating to members of the Community. It is required for the caliph to carry out his duties through consultation, taking into consideration the views of the members of the council. However, it is not incumbent upon him to always accept the views and recommendations of the members. The caliph may comment, issue instructions, announce his decisions on the proposals during the course of the proceedings or may postpone the matter under further reflection. However, in most cases the caliph accepts the advice given by the majority. At the national level, the council is presided over by the ''\u02be[[Emir|Am\u012br]]'' (National President). At the conclusion of the proceedings, the recommendations are sent to the caliph for approval which he may accept, reject or partially accept.<ref>{{cite book | url=http://www.alislam.org/books/ahmadiyyat/WelcomeBook2ndEd.pdf | title=Welcome to Ahmadiyyat, the true Islam | publisher=Islam International Publications | pages=318\u2013324 | accessdate=24 August 2014}}</ref>\n\n===The Headquarters===\n[[File:Fazl-Moschee 2010.jpg|right|thumb|[[Fazl Mosque, London|The Fazl Mosque]], the first mosque in [[London]], represents the current world headquarters of the Ahmadiyya Muslim Community]]\nThe principal headquarters of the Ahmadiyya Muslim Community is the city, town or place where the caliph resides.
