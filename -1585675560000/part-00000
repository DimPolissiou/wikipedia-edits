However, a number of artificial systems have since been established.\n\n==Static vs. dynamic==\nMolecular recognition can be subdivided into ''static molecular recognition'' and ''dynamic molecular recognition''. Static molecular recognition is likened to the interaction between a key and a keyhole; it is a 1:1 type complexation reaction between a host molecule and a guest molecule to form a [[host\u2013guest chemistry|host\u2013guest complex]]. To achieve advanced static molecular recognition, it is necessary to make recognition sites that are specific for guest molecules.\n\nIn the case of dynamic molecular recognition the binding of the first guest to the first binding site of a host affects the association constant of a second guest with a second binding site. leading to [[cooperativity]] of binding.<ref>{{Cite journal|doi=10.1021/ar000177y |pmid=11412086 |year=2001 |last1=Shinkai |first1=Seiji |last2=Ikeda |first2=Masato |last3=Sugasaki |first3=Atsushi |last4=Takeuchi |first4=Masayuki |title=Positive allosteric systems designed on dynamic supramolecular scaffolds: toward switching and amplification of guest affinity and selectivity |volume=34 |issue=6 |pages=494\u2013503 |journal=Accounts of Chemical Research}}</ref>  In the case of positive allosteric systems the binding of the first guest increases the association constant of the second guest. While for negative allosteric systems the binding of the first guest decreases the association constant with the second. The dynamic nature of this type of molecular recognition is particularly important since it provides a mechanism to regulate binding in biological systems.\nDynamic molecular recognition may enhance the ability to discriminate between several competing targets via the [[conformational proofreading]] mechanism. Dynamic molecular recognition is also being studied for application in highly functional [[chemical sensors]] and [[molecular devices]].\n\n==Complexity==\nA recent study based on molecular simulations and compliance constants describes molecular recognition as a phenomenon of organisation. Even for small molecules like carbohydrates, the recognition process can not be predicted or designed even assuming that each individual hydrogen bond's strength is exactly known.<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1039/C1CP20097F|pmid=21503359|title=Complexity in molecular recognition|journal=Physical Chemistry Chemical Physics|volume=13|issue=21|pages=10136\u201346|year=2011|last1=Grunenberg|first1=J\u00f6rg|bibcode=2011PCCP...1310136G}}</ref> However, as Mobley et al.<ref>{{Cite journal |pmid = 19368882|pmc = 2756098|year = 2009|last1 = Mobley|first1 = D.

However, a number of artificial systems have since been established.\n\n==Static vs. dynamic==\nMolecular recognition can be subdivided into ''static molecular recognition'' and ''dynamic molecular recognition''. Static molecular recognition is likened to the interaction between a key and a keyhole; it is a 1:1 type complexation reaction between a host molecule and a guest molecule to form a [[host\u2013guest chemistry|host\u2013guest complex]]. To achieve advanced static molecular recognition, it is necessary to make recognition sites that are specific for guest molecules.\n\nIn the case of dynamic molecular recognition the binding of the first guest to the first binding site of a host affects the association constant of a second guest with a second binding site. leading to [[cooperativity]] of binding.<ref>{{Cite journal|doi=10.1021/ar000177y |pmid=11412086 |year=2001 |last1=Shinkai |first1=Seiji |last2=Ikeda |first2=Masato |last3=Sugasaki |first3=Atsushi |last4=Takeuchi |first4=Masayuki |title=Positive allosteric systems designed on dynamic supramolecular scaffolds: toward switching and amplification of guest affinity and selectivity |volume=34 |issue=6 |pages=494\u2013503 |journal=Accounts of Chemical Research}}</ref>  In the case of positive allosteric systems the binding of the first guest increases the association constant of the second guest. While for negative allosteric systems the binding of the first guest decreases the association constant with the second. The dynamic nature of this type of molecular recognition is particularly important since it provides a mechanism to regulate binding in biological systems.\nDynamic molecular recognition may enhance the ability to discriminate between several competing targets via the [[conformational proofreading]] mechanism. Dynamic molecular recognition is also being studied for application in highly functional [[chemical sensors]] and [[molecular devices]].\n\n==Complexity==\nA recent study based on molecular simulations and compliance constants describes molecular recognition as a phenomenon of organisation. Even for small molecules like carbohydrates, the recognition process can not be predicted or designed even assuming that each individual hydrogen bond's strength is exactly known.<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1039/C1CP20097F|pmid=21503359|title=Complexity in molecular recognition|journal=Physical Chemistry Chemical Physics|volume=13|issue=21|pages=10136\u201346|year=2011|last1=Grunenberg|first1=J\u00f6rg|bibcode=2011PCCP...1310136G}}</ref> However, as Mobley et al.<ref>{{Cite journal |pmid = 19368882|pmc = 2756098|year = 2009|last1 = Mobley|first1 = D.

The Movement for the Actualization of the Sovereign State of Biafra ([[Movement for the Actualization of the Sovereign State of Biafra|MASSOB]]) began gaining attention in the early 2000s, along with the Biafra Zionist Movement (BZM) which rose to the spotlight in 2012.

These conflicts contributed to the formation of another faction named BZM. BZM leader Benjamin Igwe Onwuka and many members of the group were arrested for treason by the Nigerian government at a rally that took place on 5 November, 2012 in the region of Enugu. BZM\u2019s activities were scaled down because of arrests and trials of many lead members of the organization.

The organizations leader and a prominent activist named Nnamdi Kanu has been arrested by Nigeria\u2019s Department of State Services on 19 October, 2015. In response to his arrest there has been a group of pro-Biafran protesters who have been leading marches in eastern parts of Nigeria to push for his release. His arrest has pushed IPOB supporters into gaining further traction, as their mobilization grew<ref name=\":0\" />.

Some Pakistani artists began experimenting with [[rap]] and [[hip hop]] as early as 1993 when [[Fakhar-e-Alam]] released his first album ''Rap Up'', where his single ''Bhangra Pao'' is commonly acknowledged as the \"first rap song in Pakistan\". In particular, the rise in popularity of [[Eminem]] in the late 1990s and [[50 Cent]] in the early 2000s influenced many of today's hip hop artists in Pakistan such as \"Party Wrecker\" (Mustafa Khan) of the Pashto rap group Fortitude, Qzer (Qasim Naqvi) and DirtJaw.<ref name=Muftah>https://muftah.org/pakistani-hip-hop/ {{unreliable?|date=January 2020}}</ref>\n\nThe first Pakistani rap song was \"Bhangra Rap\" (1993) by Yatagaan ([[Fakhar-e-Alam]]), which became a major headliner on Pakistani music charts.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Horn |first1=David |last2=Laing |first2=Dave |title=Continuum Encyclopedia of Popular Music of the World Part 2 Locations (5 Vol Set): Volumes III to VII |date=2005 |publisher=Bloomsbury Academic |isbn=9780826474360 |page=126 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ShUKAQAAMAAJ |quote=The styles associated with rap, hip-hop and house all make their appearance in Pakistani popular music.

Pakistani hip hop and rap artists at this time were mainly underground English acts and were dismissed by the media and mainstream as \"''Eminem ki aolad''\" (Eminem's children) and \"''yo-bache''\" (yo-kids).\n\n==Genre development==\nPakistani hip hop music is still an emerging genre. Since the early 90s, hip hop music has trended slowly from underground English scenes to regional Punjabi rap in the early 2000s, before branching out into various other languages.\n\nBy the late 2000s, Punjabi rap began influencing non-Punjabi speakers to experiment with hip hop in other [[Language of Pakistan|Pakistani languages]], thus leading to new Sindhi and Pashto hip hop scenes. Urdu rap artists tried initially but failed to make a mark on the Pakistan hip hop scene. This was due to class and linguistic politics dictated in the mid-nineteenth century by the [[British Raj]], who had replaced [[Persian language|Persian]] with [[Urdu]] as the official language. Combined with Pakistan's own tendency to privilege Urdu over indigenous languages a dichotomy was created in the country whereby Urdu is associated with urbanity, power, privilege and sophistication, while other Pakistani languages such as Punjabi, Sindhi and Pashto were considered \"crass vernacularism\". Although the genre has grown considerably in recent years, it is still considered fringe and underground by the older generation who tend to stick to traditional Pakistani music or [[Pakistani pop music]].\n\n===Languages===\n====Punjabi rap====\nIn February 2006, [[Universal Music]] produced the first commercially backed album of [[Pakistani American]] rapper, [[Bohemia]].

''[[Pesa Nasha Pyar]]'' (Punjabi for \"Money Drugs Love\") was Bohemia's second album and stood out as lyrically groundbreaking.

They are the most famous mainstream Pashto Rap group from [[Pakistan]].\n\n====Sindhi rap====\nThe Sindhi hip hop scene draws on a history of linguistic nationalism of Sindhis. Many Sindhi rap artists are attempting to resurrect and mainstream Sindhi culture in Pakistan using hip hop. Many Sindhi rap artists are also continuing the long Sindhi tradition of Sufi poetry, by including them into rhymes.

To date, it is the most persuasive decision of the most persuasive state supreme court in the United States during the latter half of the 20th century: ''Dillon'' has been favorably cited and followed by at least twenty reported out-of-state appellate decisions, more than any other California appellate decision in the period from 1940 to 2005.<ref>Jake Dear and Edward W.

Dillon, and her daughter Cheryl witnessed the death of her other child in a car accident caused by a [[negligent]] driver, David Luther Legg. Two-year-old Erin Dillon was fatally struck by Legg's vehicle while crossing Bluegrass Road near its intersection with Clover Lane (near the Dillons' residence in the [[unincorporated area]] of [[Arden-Arcade, California|Arden-Arcade]] in [[Sacramento County, California|Sacramento County]]). The mother and daughter sued for emotional distress as a result of witnessing the accident. The trial court dismissed the claim under the prevailing zone of danger rule: the plaintiff needed to be in physical danger of the accident itself to recover for emotional distress.<ref>Henderson, J.A. et al.

The court urged a case-by-case analysis of several factors to determine if foreseeability would create a duty to a bystander:\n\n*Whether the plaintiff was near the scene of the accident,\n*Whether the plaintiff suffered an emotional shock from contemporaneously observing the accident, and\n*Whether the plaintiff is closely related to the victim\n\nUsing these criteria, the court determined that it was foreseeable that the negligent operation of an automobile could cause emotional distress to a mother witnessing the injury of her child in an accident.<ref>Henderson, J.A. et al., p. 307</ref>\n\n===Traynor's dissent===\nIn his dissenting opinion, Justice Traynor asserted that the case should have been decided according to the zone of danger rule enunciated in the case ''Amaya v.

Burke criticized the guidelines offered by the majority as insufficient protection against possibly limitless liability.  Burke viewed the limitations on liability inherent in the zone of danger rule as logical and necessary, and thought that such a pronounced change in liability rules should be adopted by the legislature and not the courts.<ref>''Dillon'', 68 Cal.2d at 749-52</ref>\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==See also==\n*''[[Thing v.

Legg''''', [[case citation|68 Cal. 2d 728]] (1968), was a [[legal case|case]] decided by the [[Supreme Court of California]] that established the [[tort]] of [[negligent infliction of emotional distress]].  To date, it is the most persuasive decision of the most persuasive state supreme court in the United States during the latter half of the 20th century: ''Dillon'' has been favorably cited and followed by at least twenty reported out-of-state appellate decisions, more than any other California appellate decision in the period from 1940 to 2005.<ref>Jake Dear and Edward W. Jessen, ''\" Followed Rates\" and Leading State Cases, 1940-2005'', <span style=\"font-variant: small-caps;\">[http://lawreview.law.ucdavis.edu/issues/41/2/essay/DavisVol41No2_Dear.pdf 41 U.C.

Dillon, and her daughter Cheryl witnessed the death of her other child in a car accident caused by a [[negligent]] driver, David Luther Legg. Two-year-old Erin Dillon was fatally struck by Legg's vehicle while crossing Bluegrass Road near its intersection with Clover Lane (near the Dillons' residence in the [[unincorporated area]] of [[Arden-Arcade, California|Arden-Arcade]] in [[Sacramento County, California|Sacramento County]]). The mother and daughter sued for emotional distress as a result of witnessing the accident. The trial court dismissed the claim under the prevailing zone of danger rule: the plaintiff needed to be in physical danger of the accident itself to recover for emotional distress.<ref>Henderson, J.A. et al.

The court urged a case by case analysis of several factors to determine if foreseeability would create a duty to a bystander:\n\n*Whether the plaintiff was near the scene of the accident,\n*Whether the plaintiff suffered an emotional shock from contemporaneously observing the accident, and\n*Whether the plaintiff is closely related to the victim\n\nUsing these criteria, the court determined that it was foreseeable that the negligent operation of an automobile could cause emotional distress to a mother witnessing the injury of her child in an accident.<ref>Henderson, J.A. et al., p. 307</ref>\n\n===Traynor's dissent===\nIn his dissenting opinion, Justice Traynor asserted that the case should have been decided according to the zone of danger rule enunciated in the case ''Amaya v. Home Ice, Fuel & Supply Co.''<ref>''Dillon v. Legg'', 68 Cal.2d 728, 748 (1968)</ref>\n\n===Burke's dissent===\nIn dissent, Justice Burke asserted that the majority had adopted arguments that were previously rejected in ''Amaya''.  Burke criticized the guidelines offered by the majority as insufficient protection against possibly limitless liability.  Burke viewed the limitations on liability inherent in the zone of danger rule as logical and necessary, and thought that such a pronounced change in liability rules should be adopted by the legislature and not the courts.<ref>''Dillon'', 68 Cal.2d at 749-52</ref>\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==See also==\n*''[[Thing v.
