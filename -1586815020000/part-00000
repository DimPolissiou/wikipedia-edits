The oldest said that if she married the royal butler, she would give the entire court a drink out of one glass, with water left over.  The second said that if she married the keeper of the royal wardrobe, she would dress the entire court in one piece of cloth, and have some left over.  The [[Youngest daughter|youngest]] said that if she married the king, she would bear two sons with apples in their hands, and a daughter with a star on her forehead.\n\nThe next morning, the king ordered the older two sisters to do as they said, and then married them to the butler and the keeper of the royal wardrobe, and the youngest to himself.  The queen became pregnant, and the king had to go to war, leaving behind news that he was to hear of the birth of his children.  The queen gave birth to the children she had promised, but her sisters, jealous, put three puppies in their place, sent word to the king, and handed over the children to be abandoned.  The king ordered that his wife be put in a [[treadwheel crane]].\n\nThree [[fairy|fairies]] saw the abandoned children and gave them a deer to nurse them, a purse full of money, and a ring that changed color when misfortune befell one of them.  When they were grown, they left for the city and took a house.\n\nTheir aunts saw them and were terror-struck.  They sent their nurse to visit the daughter and tell her that the house needed the Dancing Water to be perfect and her brothers should get it for her.  The oldest son left and found three hermits in turn.  The first two could not help him, but the third told him how to retrieve the Dancing Water, and he brought it back to the house.  On seeing it, the aunts sent their nurse to tell the girl that the house needed the Singing Apple as well, but the brother got it, as he had the Dancing Water.  The [[Rule of three (writing)|third time]], they sent him after the Speaking Bird, but as one of the conditions was that he not respond to the bird, and it told him that his aunts were trying to kill him and his mother was in the treadmill, it shocked him into speech, and he was turned to stone.  The ring changed colors.  His brother came after him, but suffered the same fate.  Their sister came after them both, said nothing, and transformed her brother and many other statues back to life.\n\nThey returned home, and the king saw them and thought that if he did not know his wife had given birth to three puppies, he would think these his children.  They invited him to dinner, and the Speaking Bird told the king all that had happened.  The king executed the aunts and their nurse and took his wife and children back to the palace.\n\n==Overview==\nThe following summary was based on [[Joseph Jacobs]]'s tale reconstruction in his ''Europa's Fairy Book'', on the general analyses made by Arthur Bernard Cook in his ''Zeus, a Study in Ancient Religion'',<ref>Extracted from Cook, Arthur Bernard. ''Zeus, A Study In Ancient Religion''. Cambridge University Press. 1925. Vol. II, Part I. Appendix F. pp. 1003-1019.</ref> and on the description of the tale-type in the [[Aarne-Thompson|Aarne-Thompson-Uther index]] classification of folk and fairy tales.<ref>''Lesebuchgeschichten: Erz\u00e4hlstoffe in Schulleseb\u00fcchern, 1770-1920''. Ingrid Tomkowiak. Berlin: De Gruyter. 1993. p. 254.</ref> This type follows an almost fixed structure, with very similar characteristics, regardless of their geographic distribution:<ref>Cook, Arthur Bernard. ''Zeus, A Study In Ancient Religion''. Cambridge University Press. 1925. Vol. II, Part I. Appendix F. pp. 1003-1019.</ref>\n\nThe king passes by a house or other place where [[Rule of three (writing)|three]] sisters are gossiping or talking, and the [[Youngest daughter|youngest]] says, if the king married her, she would bear him \"wondrous children\" (their peculiar appearances tend to vary, but they are usually connected with astronomical motifs on some part of their bodies, such as the Sun, the moon or stars). The king overhears their talk and marries the youngest sister, to the envy of the older ones or to the chagrin of the grandmother. As such, the jealous relatives deprive the mother of her newborn children (in some tales, [[Twins|twins]] or [[Triplets|triplets]], or [[Rule of three (writing)|three consecutive births]], but the boy is usually the firstborn, and the girl is the youngest), either by replacing the children with animals or accusing the mother of having devoured them. Their mother is banished from the kingdom or severely punished (imprisoned in the dungeon or in a cage; walled in; buried up to the torso). Meanwhile, the children are either hidden by a servant of the castle (gardener, cook, butcher) or cast into the water, but they are found and brought up at a distance from the father's home by a childless foster family (fisherman, miller, etc.).\n\nYears later, after they reach a certain age, a magical helper (a fairy, or the Virgin Mary in more religious variants) gives them means to survive in the world. Soon enough, the children move next to the palace where the king lives, and either the aunts, or grandmother realize their nephews/grandchildren are alive and send the midwife (or a maid; a witch; a slave) or disguise themselves to tell the sister that her house needs some marvellous items, and incite the girl to convince her brother(s) to embark on the (perilous) quest. The items also tend to vary, but in many versions there are three treasures: (1) water, or some water source (e.g., spring, fountain, sea, stream) with fantastic properties (e.g., a golden fountain, or a rejuvenating liquid); (2) a magical tree (or branch, or bough, or flower, or a fruit - usually apples) with strange powers (e.g., makes music or sings); and (3) a wondrous bird that can tell the truth, knows many languages and/or turns people to stone.<ref>However, Stith Thompson, in his book of Folklore Motifs, indicates that the formula is \"a dancing item, a singing item and the bird\".</ref> \n\nThe brother(s) set(s) off on his (their) journey, but give(s) a token to the sister so she knows the brother(s) is(are) alive. Eventually, the brothers meet a character (a sage, an ogre, etc.) that warns them not to listen to the bird, otherwise he will be petrified (or turned to salt, or to marble pillars). The first brother fails the quest, and so does the next one. The sister, seeing that the tokens changed colour, realizes her siblings are in danger and departs to finish the quest for the wonderful items and rescue her brother(s).\n\nAfterwards, either the siblings invite the king or the king invites the brothers and their sister for a feast in the palace. As per the bird's instructions, the siblings display their etiquette during the meal (in some versions, they make a suggestion to invite the disgraced queen; in others, they give their poisoned meal to some dogs). Then, the bird reveals the whole truth, the children are reunited with their parents, and the jealous relatives are punished.\n\n==Variations==\n\nWhile the formula is almost followed to the letter, some variatons occur in the second part of the story (the quest for the magical items), and even in the conclusion of the tale:\n\n===The Brother Quests for a Bride===\n\nIn some tales, when the sister is lured by the antagonist's agent, she is told to look for the belongings (mirror, flower, handkerchief) of a woman of unearthly beauty or a fairy. Such variants occur in Albania, as in the tales collected by [[Johann Georg von Hahn|J. G. Von Hahn]] in his ''Griechische und Albanische M\u00e4rchen'' (Leipzig, 1864), in the village of [[Zagori]] in [[Epirus]],<ref>''Zeus, a Study in Ancient Religion''. Arthur Bernard Cook. Cambridge University Press. 1925. p. 1006-1007.</ref> and by Auguste Dozon in ''Contes Albanais'' (Paris, 1881).

In this version, it is a king who overhears the sisters' nightly conversation in his search for a wife for his son. At the end, the brother marries the foreign princess and his sister reveals the truth to the court.<ref name=\"autogenerated111\">Seklemian, A. G.

In this tale, the [[Rule of Seven|seventh]] queen begets the wonder-children ([[fraternal twins]], a girl and a boy); the antagonists are the other six queens, who, overcome with jealousy, trick the new queen with puppies and expose the children. When they both grow up, the jealous queens set the siblings on a quest for a ''kataki'' flower, with the brother rescuing Lady Pushpavati from [[Rakshasas]]. Lady Pushpavati marries the titular \"boy with the moon on his forehead\" and reveals to the King her mother-in-law's ordeal and the deceit of the King's co-wives.<ref name=\"archive236\">Folk-Tales of Bengal.

D'Aulnoy, where the heroine rescues her cousin, Prince Ch\u00e9ri, and marries him. Another French variant, collected by [[Henry Carnoy]] (''L'Arbre qui chante, l'Oiseau qui parle et l'Eau d'or'', or \"The tree that sings, the bird that speaks and the water of gold\"), has the youngest daughter, the princess, marry an enchanted old man she meets in her journey and who gives her advice on how to obtain the items.<ref>Carnoy, Henry. ''Contes fran\u00e7ais''. France, Paris: E.

Their sister arrives at a field of white and black stones and, after a bird gives her instructions, sprinkles magic water on the stones, restoring her brothers and many others - among them, a young man, whom she later marries.<ref>Franzisci, Franz. ''M\u00e4rchen aus K\u00e4rnten: Jugendbuch''. 2006. {{ISBN 978-3-900531-61-4}}</ref>\n\nIn the [[Armenian language|Armenian]] variant ''Th\u00e9odore, le Danseur'', the brother ventures on a quest for the belongings of the eponymous character and, at the conclusion of the tale, this fabled male dancer marries the sister.<ref>Hoogasian-Villa, Susie. ''100 Armenian Tales and Their Folkloristic Relevance''. Detroit: Wayne State University Press. 1966. pp. 492.</ref><ref>Drower, E. S. (Ethel Stefana), Lady, b. 1879. Folktales of Iraq. Mineola, NY: Dover Publications. 2006. p. 294.</ref>\n\nA similar conclusion happens in the commedia dell'arte ''[[The Green Bird]]'', where the brother undergoes the quest for the items, and the titular green bird is a cursed prince, who, after being released from its avian form, marries the sister.\n\n===The Tale of Tsar Saltan===\n\nSome versions of the tale have the mother being cast out with the babies into the sea in a box, after the king is tricked into thinking his wife did not deliver her promised wonder children. The box eventually washes ashore on the beaches of an island or another country. There, the child (or children) magically grows up in hours or days and builds an enchanted castle or house that attracts the attention of the common folk (or merchants, or travellers). Word reaches the ears of the despondent king, who hears about the mysterious owners of such fantastic abode, who just happen to look like the children he would have had.\n\nRussian tale collections attest to the presence of [[Baba Yaga]], the witch of [[Slavic folklore]], as the antagonist in many of the stories.<ref>Johns, Andreas. ''Baba Yaga: The Ambiguous Mother and Witch of the Russian Folktale''. New York: Peter Lang. 2010. pp. 244-246. {{ISBN|978-0-8204-6769-6}}</ref>\n\nIn some variants, the castaway boy sets a trap to rescue his brothers and release them from a [[Shapeshifting|transformation curse]]. For example, in ''N\u00e1d P\u00e9ter'' (\"Schilf-Peter\"), a Hungarian variant,<ref>R\u00f3na-Sklarek, Elisabet. ''Ungarische Volksm\u00e4rchen''. Neue Folge. Leipzig: Dieterich. 1909. pp. 53-65.</ref> when the hero of the tale sees a flock of eleven swans flying, he recognizes them as their brothers, who have been transformed into birds due to divine intervention by [[Jesus Christ|Christ]] and [[St. Peter]].\n\nIn another format, the boy asks his mother to prepare a meal with her \"breast milk\" and prepares to invade his brothers' residence to confirm if they are indeed his siblings. This plot happens in a Finnish variant, from [[Ingermanland]], collected in ''Finnische und Estnische Volksm\u00e4rchen'' (''Bruder und Schwester und die goldlockigen K\u00f6nigss\u00f6hne'', or \"Brother and Sister, and the golden-haired sons of the King\").<ref>L\u00f6wis of Menar, August von. ''Finnische und estnische Volksm\u00e4rchen''. Jena: Eugen Diederichs. 1922. pp. 53-59.</ref> The mother gives birth to six sons with special traits who are sold to a devil by the old midwife. Some time later, their youngest brother enters the devil's residence and succeeds in rescuing his siblings.\n\n===The Boys With The Golden Stars===\n\nThe motif of a woman's babies, born with wonderful attributes after she claimed she could bear such children, but stolen from her, is a common fairy tale motif. In this plot-type, an evil stepmother (or grandmother, or gypsy, or slave, or maid) kills the babies, but the twins go through a resurrective reincarnation: from trees to animals and finally into humans babies again. This [[Transformation chase|transformation chase]] where the stepmother is unable to prevent the children's reappearance is unusual, although it appears in \"[[A String of Pearls Twined with Golden Flowers]]\" and in \"The Count's Evil Mother\", a [[Croatia]]n tale from the [[Karlovac]] area.<ref name=\"vrki\u01071997\">{{cite book|last=Vrki\u0107|first= Jozo|authorlink=Jozo Vrki\u0107 |title=Hrvatske bajke|location= Glagol, Zagreb|year= 1997}} The tale first published in written form by Rudolf Strohal.</ref>\n\nMost versions of ''The Boys With Golden Stars''<ref>''A Companion to the Fairy Tale''. Edited by Hilda Ellis Davidson and Anna Chaudhri. Cambridge: D. S. Brewer. 2003. p. 43. {{ISBN|0-85991-784-3}}</ref> begin with the birth of male twins, but very rarely there are fraternal twins, a boy and a girl. When they transform into human babies again, the siblings grow up at an impossibly fast rate and hide their supernatural trait under a hood or a cap. Soon after, they show up in their father's court or house to reveal the truth through a riddle or through a ballad.\n\nThis tale's format happens in many variants collected in the [[Balkan]] area, specially in Romenia,<ref name=\"autogenerated121\">''Die goldenen kinder''.

Very rarely, it is one of the children themselves that reveal the aunts' treachery to their father, as seen in the [[Armenia|Armenian]] variants ''The Twins'' and ''Theodore, le Danseur''.<ref>Hoogasian-Villa, Susie.

This version of the tale preserves the motif of the wonder-children, which are born \"with golden chains around their necks\", the substitution for animals and the degradation of the mother, but merges with the fairy tale ''[[The Six Swans]]'', where brothers transformed into birds are rescued by the efforts of their sister{{sfnp|Schlauch|1969|p=80}}, which is [[Aarne-Thompson]] 451, \"The boys or brothers transformed into birds\".\n\nIn a brief summary:<ref name=OFCC-Dolopathos/><ref name=Hibbard240-1>{{Harvnb|Hibbard|1963|pp=240-1}}</ref> a lord encounters a mysterious woman (clearly a [[swan maiden]] or [[fairy]]) in the act of bathing, while clutching a gold necklace, they marry and she gives birth to a [[septuplet]], six boys and a girl, with golden chains about their necks. But her evil mother-in-law swaps the newborn with seven puppies. The servant with orders to kill the children in the forest just [[Child abandonment#In fiction|abandons]] them under a tree. The young lord is told by his wicked mother that his bride gave birth to a litter of pups, and he punishes her by burying her up to the neck for seven years.  Some time later, the young lord while hunting encounters the children in the forest, and the wicked mother's lie starts to unravel. The servant is sent out to search them, and find the boys bathing in the form of swans, with their sister guarding their gold chains. The servant steals the boys' chains, preventing them from changing back to human form, and the chains are taken to a goldsmith to be melted down to make a goblet. The swan-boys land in the young lord's pond, and their sister, who can still transform back and forth into human shape by the magic of her chain, goes to the castle to obtain bread to her brothers. Eventually the young lord asks her story so the truth comes out. The goldsmith was actually unable to melt down the chains, and had kept them for himself. These are now restored back to the six boys, and they regain their powers, except one, whose chain the smith had damaged in the attempt. So he alone is stuck in swan form. The work goes on to say obliquely hints that this is the swan in the Swan Knight tale, more precisely, that this was the swan \u201c''quod cathena aurea militem in navicula trahat armatum'' (that tugged by a gold chain an armed knight in a boat).\u201d<ref name=OFCC-Dolopathos/>\n\nThe motif of the heroine persecuted by the queen, on false pretenses, also happens in ''Istoria della Regina Stella e Mattabruna'',<ref>''Istoria della Regina Stella e Mattabruna: dove leggendo sentirete come farono mandati i figliuoli ad annegare, e le fu posto nel letto quattro cagnoli, e dopo fu messa prigione, i condannata a morte per false accuse, e fu liberata dai suni figliuoli con la morte del gigante.'' 1822.

While the royal husband is away at war, she gives birth to Prince Gvidon Saltanovitch, but her sisters conspire to cast mother and child to the sea in a barrel. Both she and the baby wash ashore in the island of [[Buyan]], where Prince Gvidon grows up to an adult male.

In the second part of the tale, the youngest child, a girl, witnesses her brothers' transformation into crows, but she is eventually found and marries a Rajah of a neighboring region. Her child, the prince, learns of his family history and ventures on a quest to reverse his uncles's transformation.

The oldest said that if she married the royal butler, she would give the entire court a drink out of one glass, with water left over.  The second said that if she married the keeper of the royal wardrobe, she would dress the entire court in one piece of cloth, and have some left over.  The [[Youngest daughter|youngest]] said that if she married the king, she would bear two sons with apples in their hands, and a daughter with a star on her forehead.\n\nThe next morning, the king ordered the older two sisters to do as they said, and then married them to the butler and the keeper of the royal wardrobe, and the youngest to himself.  The queen became pregnant, and the king had to go to war, leaving behind news that he was to hear of the birth of his children.  The queen gave birth to the children she had promised, but her sisters, jealous, put three puppies in their place, sent word to the king, and handed over the children to be abandoned.  The king ordered that his wife be put in a [[treadwheel crane]].\n\nThree [[fairy|fairies]] saw the abandoned children and gave them a deer to nurse them, a purse full of money, and a ring that changed color when misfortune befell one of them.  When they were grown, they left for the city and took a house.\n\nTheir aunts saw them and were terror-struck.  They sent their nurse to visit the daughter and tell her that the house needed the Dancing Water to be perfect and her brothers should get it for her.  The oldest son left and found three hermits in turn.  The first two could not help him, but the third told him how to retrieve the Dancing Water, and he brought it back to the house.  On seeing it, the aunts sent their nurse to tell the girl that the house needed the Singing Apple as well, but the brother got it, as he had the Dancing Water.  The [[Rule of three (writing)|third time]], they sent him after the Speaking Bird, but as one of the conditions was that he not respond to the bird, and it told him that his aunts were trying to kill him and his mother was in the treadmill, it shocked him into speech, and he was turned to stone.  The ring changed colors.  His brother came after him, but suffered the same fate.  Their sister came after them both, said nothing, and transformed her brother and many other statues back to life.\n\nThey returned home, and the king saw them and thought that if he did not know his wife had given birth to three puppies, he would think these his children.  They invited him to dinner, and the Speaking Bird told the king all that had happened.  The king executed the aunts and their nurse and took his wife and children back to the palace.\n\n==Overview==\nThe following summary was based on [[Joseph Jacobs]]'s tale reconstruction in his ''Europa's Fairy Book'', on the general analyses made by Arthur Bernard Cook in his ''Zeus, a Study in Ancient Religion'',<ref>Extracted from Cook, Arthur Bernard. ''Zeus, A Study In Ancient Religion''. Cambridge University Press. 1925. Vol. II, Part I. Appendix F. pp. 1003-1019.</ref> and on the description of the tale-type in the [[Aarne-Thompson|Aarne-Thompson-Uther index]] classification of folk and fairy tales.<ref>''Lesebuchgeschichten: Erz\u00e4hlstoffe in Schulleseb\u00fcchern, 1770-1920''. Ingrid Tomkowiak. Berlin: De Gruyter. 1993. p. 254.</ref> This type follows an almost fixed structure, with very similar characteristics, regardless of their geographic distribution:<ref>Cook, Arthur Bernard. ''Zeus, A Study In Ancient Religion''. Cambridge University Press. 1925. Vol. II, Part I. Appendix F. pp. 1003-1019.</ref>\n\nThe king passes by a house or other place where [[Rule of three (writing)|three]] sisters are gossiping or talking, and the [[Youngest daughter|youngest]] says, if the king married her, she would bear him \"wondrous children\" (their peculiar appearances tend to vary, but they are usually connected with astronomical motifs on some part of their bodies, such as the Sun, the moon or stars). The king overhears their talk and marries the youngest sister, to the envy of the older ones or to the chagrin of the grandmother. As such, the jealous relatives deprive the mother of her newborn children (in some tales, [[Twins|twins]] or [[Triplets|triplets]], or [[Rule of three (writing)|three consecutive births]], but the boy is usually the firstborn, and the girl is the youngest), either by replacing the children with animals or accusing the mother of having devoured them. Their mother is banished from the kingdom or severely punished (imprisoned in the dungeon or in a cage; walled in; buried up to the torso). Meanwhile, the children are either hidden by a servant of the castle (gardener, cook, butcher) or cast into the water, but they are found and brought up at a distance from the father's home by a childless foster family (fisherman, miller, etc.).\n\nYears later, after they reach a certain age, a magical helper (a fairy, or the Virgin Mary in more religious variants) gives them means to survive in the world. Soon enough, the children move next to the palace where the king lives, and either the aunts, or grandmother realize their nephews/grandchildren are alive and send the midwife (or a maid; a witch; a slave) or disguise themselves to tell the sister that her house needs some marvellous items, and incite the girl to convince her brother(s) to embark on the (perilous) quest. The items also tend to vary, but in many versions there are three treasures: (1) water, or some water source (e.g., spring, fountain, sea, stream) with fantastic properties (e.g., a golden fountain, or a rejuvenating liquid); (2) a magical tree (or branch, or bough, or flower, or a fruit - usually apples) with strange powers (e.g., makes music or sings); and (3) a wondrous bird that can tell the truth, knows many languages and/or turns people to stone.<ref>However, Stith Thompson, in his book of Folklore Motifs, indicates that the formula is \"a dancing item, a singing item and the bird\".</ref> \n\nThe brother(s) set(s) off on his (their) journey, but give(s) a token to the sister so she knows the brother(s) is(are) alive. Eventually, the brothers meet a character (a sage, an ogre, etc.) that warns them not to listen to the bird, otherwise he will be petrified (or turned to salt, or to marble pillars). The first brother fails the quest, and so does the next one. The sister, seeing that the tokens changed colour, realizes her siblings are in danger and departs to finish the quest for the wonderful items and rescue her brother(s).\n\nAfterwards, either the siblings invite the king or the king invites the brothers and their sister for a feast in the palace. As per the bird's instructions, the siblings display their etiquette during the meal (in some versions, they make a suggestion to invite the disgraced queen; in others, they give their poisoned meal to some dogs). Then, the bird reveals the whole truth, the children are reunited with their parents, and the jealous relatives are punished.\n\n==Variations==\n\nWhile the formula is almost followed to the letter, some variatons occur in the second part of the story (the quest for the magical items), and even in the conclusion of the tale:\n\n===The Brother Quests for a Bride===\n\nIn some tales, when the sister is lured by the antagonist's agent, she is told to look for the belongings (mirror, flower, handkerchief) of a woman of unearthly beauty or a fairy. Such variants occur in Albania, as in the tales collected by [[Johann Georg von Hahn|J. G. Von Hahn]] in his ''Griechische und Albanische M\u00e4rchen'' (Leipzig, 1864), in the village of [[Zagori]] in [[Epirus]],<ref>''Zeus, a Study in Ancient Religion''. Arthur Bernard Cook. Cambridge University Press. 1925. p. 1006-1007.</ref> and by Auguste Dozon in ''Contes Albanais'' (Paris, 1881). These stories substitute the quest for the items for the search for a fairy named ''[[E Bukura e Dheut]]'' (\"Beauty of the Land\"), a woman of extraordinary beauty and magical powers.<ref>Elsie, Robert (2001).

When they both grow up, the jealous queens set the siblings on a quest for a ''kataki'' flower, with the brother rescuing Lady Pushpavati from [[Rakshasas]]. Lady Pushpavati marries the titular \"boy with the moon on his forehead\" and reveals to the King her mother-in-law's ordeal and the deceit of the King's co-wives.<ref name=\"archive236\">Folk-Tales of Bengal.

D'Aulnoy, where the heroine rescues her cousin, Prince Ch\u00e9ri, and marries him. Another French variant, collected by [[Henry Carnoy]] (''L'Arbre qui chante, l'Oiseau qui parle et l'Eau d'or'', or \"The tree that sings, the bird that speaks and the water of gold\"), has the youngest daughter, the princess, marry an enchanted old man she meets in her journey and who gives her advice on how to obtain the items.<ref>Carnoy, Henry.

The box eventually washes ashore on the beaches of an island or another country. There, the child (or children) magically grows up in hours or days and builds an enchanted castle or house that attracts the attention of the common folk (or merchants, or travellers). Word reaches the ears of the despondent king, who hears about the mysterious owners of such fantastic abode, who just happen to look like the children he would have had.\n\nRussian tale collections attest to the presence of [[Baba Yaga]], the witch of [[Slavic folklore]], as the antagonist in many of the stories.<ref>Johns, Andreas. ''Baba Yaga: The Ambiguous Mother and Witch of the Russian Folktale''. New York: Peter Lang. 2010. pp. 244-246. {{ISBN|978-0-8204-6769-6}}</ref>\n\nIn some variants, the castaway boy sets a trap to rescue his brothers and release them from a [[Shapeshifting|transformation curse]]. For example, in ''N\u00e1d P\u00e9ter'' (\"Schilf-Peter\"), a Hungarian variant,<ref>R\u00f3na-Sklarek, Elisabet. ''Ungarische Volksm\u00e4rchen''. Neue Folge. Leipzig: Dieterich. 1909. pp. 53-65.</ref> when the hero of the tale sees a flock of eleven swans flying, he recognizes them as their brothers, who have been transformed into birds due to divine intervention by [[Jesus Christ|Christ]] and [[St. Peter]].\n\nIn another format, the boy asks his mother to prepare a meal with her \"breast milk\" and prepares to invade his brothers' residence to confirm if they are indeed his siblings. This plot happens in a Finnish variant, from [[Ingermanland]], collected in ''Finnische und Estnische Volksm\u00e4rchen'' (''Bruder und Schwester und die goldlockigen K\u00f6nigss\u00f6hne'', or \"Brother and Sister, and the golden-haired sons of the King\").<ref>L\u00f6wis of Menar, August von. ''Finnische und estnische Volksm\u00e4rchen''. Jena: Eugen Diederichs. 1922. pp. 53-59.</ref> The mother gives birth to six sons with special traits who are sold to a devil by the old midwife. Some time later, their youngest brother enters the devil's residence and succeeds in rescuing his siblings.\n\n===The Boys With The Golden Stars===\n\nThe motif of a woman's babies, born with wonderful attributes after she claimed she could bear such children, but stolen from her, is a common fairy tale motif. In this plot-type, an evil stepmother (or grandmother, or gypsy, or slave, or maid) kills the babies, but the twins go through a resurrective reincarnation: from trees to animals and finally into humans babies again. This [[Transformation chase|transformation chase]] where the stepmother is unable to prevent the children's reappearance is unusual, although it appears in \"[[A String of Pearls Twined with Golden Flowers]]\" and in \"The Count's Evil Mother\", a [[Croatia]]n tale from the [[Karlovac]] area.<ref name=\"vrki\u01071997\">{{cite book|last=Vrki\u0107|first= Jozo|authorlink=Jozo Vrki\u0107 |title=Hrvatske bajke|location= Glagol, Zagreb|year= 1997}} The tale first published in written form by Rudolf Strohal.</ref>\n\nMost versions of ''The Boys With Golden Stars''<ref>''A Companion to the Fairy Tale''. Edited by Hilda Ellis Davidson and Anna Chaudhri. Cambridge: D. S. Brewer. 2003. p. 43. {{ISBN|0-85991-784-3}}</ref> begin with the birth of male twins, but very rarely there are fraternal twins, a boy and a girl. When they transform into human babies again, the siblings grow up at an impossibly fast rate and hide their supernatural trait under a hood or a cap. Soon after, they show up in their father's court or house to reveal the truth through a riddle or through a ballad.\n\nThis tale's format happens in many variants collected in the [[Balkan]] area, specially in Romenia,<ref name=\"autogenerated121\">''Die goldenen kinder''.

Very rarely, it is one of the children themselves that reveal the aunts' treachery to their father, as seen in the [[Armenia|Armenian]] variants ''The Twins'' and ''Theodore, le Danseur''.<ref>Hoogasian-Villa, Susie.

This version of the tale preserves the motif of the wonder-children, which are born \"with golden chains around their necks\", the substitution for animals and the degradation of the mother, but merges with the fairy tale ''[[The Six Swans]]'', where brothers transformed into birds are rescued by the efforts of their sister{{sfnp|Schlauch|1969|p=80}}, which is [[Aarne-Thompson]] 451, \"The boys or brothers transformed into birds\".\n\nIn a brief summary:<ref name=OFCC-Dolopathos/><ref name=Hibbard240-1>{{Harvnb|Hibbard|1963|pp=240-1}}</ref> a lord encounters a mysterious woman (clearly a [[swan maiden]] or [[fairy]]) in the act of bathing, while clutching a gold necklace, they marry and she gives birth to a [[septuplet]], six boys and a girl, with golden chains about their necks. But her evil mother-in-law swaps the newborn with seven puppies. The servant with orders to kill the children in the forest just [[Child abandonment#In fiction|abandons]] them under a tree. The young lord is told by his wicked mother that his bride gave birth to a litter of pups, and he punishes her by burying her up to the neck for seven years.  Some time later, the young lord while hunting encounters the children in the forest, and the wicked mother's lie starts to unravel. The servant is sent out to search them, and find the boys bathing in the form of swans, with their sister guarding their gold chains. The servant steals the boys' chains, preventing them from changing back to human form, and the chains are taken to a goldsmith to be melted down to make a goblet. The swan-boys land in the young lord's pond, and their sister, who can still transform back and forth into human shape by the magic of her chain, goes to the castle to obtain bread to her brothers. Eventually the young lord asks her story so the truth comes out. The goldsmith was actually unable to melt down the chains, and had kept them for himself. These are now restored back to the six boys, and they regain their powers, except one, whose chain the smith had damaged in the attempt. So he alone is stuck in swan form. The work goes on to say obliquely hints that this is the swan in the Swan Knight tale, more precisely, that this was the swan \u201c''quod cathena aurea militem in navicula trahat armatum'' (that tugged by a gold chain an armed knight in a boat).\u201d<ref name=OFCC-Dolopathos/>\n\nThe motif of the heroine persecuted by the queen, on false pretenses, also happens in ''Istoria della Regina Stella e Mattabruna'',<ref>''Istoria della Regina Stella e Mattabruna: dove leggendo sentirete come farono mandati i figliuoli ad annegare, e le fu posto nel letto quattro cagnoli, e dopo fu messa prigione, i condannata a morte per false accuse, e fu liberata dai suni figliuoli con la morte del gigante.'' 1822.

While the royal husband is away at war, she gives birth to Prince Gvidon Saltanovitch, but her sisters conspire to cast mother and child to the sea in a barrel. Both she and the baby wash ashore in the island of [[Buyan]], where Prince Gvidon grows up to an adult male.

In the second part of the tale, the youngest child, a girl, witnesses her brothers' transformation into crows, but she is eventually found and marries a Rajah of a neighboring region. Her child, the prince, learns of his family history and ventures on a quest to reverse his uncles's transformation.

As they camp overnight, Jimmy tells Mike that Kim knows of his work for Lalo, and Mike warns Jimmy that if she knows details about the Salamancas, Kim is now \"in the game\". Jimmy and Mike resume their trek the following morning.\n\nWhen Jimmy fails to return, Kim pretends to be Lalo's attorney, tells him she is Jimmy's wife and asks him for Jimmy's location so she can search.

Hogan accepted his challenge later that night.<ref name=\"SDMar61\"/> Two weeks later on the March 20 episode of ''SmackDown!'', McMahon and Hogan had a contract signing for their match at WrestleMania. As Hogan was preparing to sign the contract, McMahon attacked with a steel chair from behind. Shortly afterward, McMahon hit Hogan several times with the chair in the head, causing him to [[Blading (professional wrestling)|bleed]]. McMahon then signed the contract and forced Hogan to sign with his blood.<ref name=\"SDMar201\"/>\n\nAnother feud on the Raw brand was between [[Triple H]] and [[Booker T (wrestler)|Booker T]], with the two feuding over the [[World Heavyweight Championship (WWE)|World Heavyweight Championship]]. Triple H won the title three months prior at [[Armageddon (2002)|Armageddon]] by defeating then-champion [[Shawn Michaels]] in a [[Professional wrestling match types#Two out of three falls|3 Stages of Hell match]].<ref name=\"Armageddon - HHH vs HBK\">{{cite web|date=2002-12-15|url=http://www.wwe.com/shows/armageddon/history/2002/mainevent/|title=Triple H defeated Shawn Michaels in a Three Stages of Hell Match to win the World Heavyweight Championship|publisher=WWE|accessdate=2008-02-23}}</ref> Since that event, Triple H had wrestled [[Scott Steiner]] during the following two pay-per-view events for the World Heavyweight Championship. First was at the [[Royal Rumble (2003)|Royal Rumble]], where Triple H got himself disqualified when he nailed Steiner with the [[sledgehammer]] but retained the title. Then at No Way Out, he defeated Steiner by [[Professional wrestling#Pinfall|pinfall]] to retain the title. On the February 24 episode of ''Raw'', Booker T won a [[Battle royal (professional wrestling)|20-man battle royal]] by last eliminating The Rock to become the number one contender to the World Heavyweight Championship at WrestleMania.<ref name=\"RAWFeb242\"/> On the March 3 episode of ''Raw'', World Heavyweight Champion Triple H cut a controversial promo on Booker T. Triple H downplayed Booker T's WCW success, pointing out that the [[WCW World Heavyweight Championship]] had been held by non-wrestlers like [[Vince Russo]] and actor [[David Arquette]] calling WCW and its title \"a joke\". He implied that Booker T, as a convicted criminal, would never win a world championship in WWE. In the WrestleMania XIX press conference [[Michael Cole (wrestling)|Michael Cole]] questioned Triple H as to whether he had cut a racist promo, Triple H confirmed this was not the case and was indeed referring to Booker's criminal past.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.onlineworldofwrestling.com/results/raw/030303.html|title=RAW Results March 3, 2003|publisher=Online World of Wrestling}}</ref> On the March 10 episode of ''Raw'', Booker T got revenge by attacking Triple H in the bathroom, laying him out.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.onlineworldofwrestling.com/results/raw/030310.html|title=RAW Results March 10, 2003|publisher=Online World of Wrestling}}</ref> On the March 24 episode of ''Raw'', Booker T and [[Goldust]] defeated Triple H and [[Ric Flair]] in a [[Professional wrestling match types#Tag team match|tag team match]].\n\nAnother feud from the Raw brand was the squabble over the [[WWE Women's Championship (1956\u20132010)|Women's Championship]]; the champion Victoria had captured the title from Trish Stratus at [[Survivor Series (2002)|Survivor Series]]. Then at Armageddon, Victoria defeated Stratus and Jacqueline in a [[Professional wrestling#Triple Threat match|triple threat match]] to retain the Women's Championship. Stratus and the returning Jazz had a match on ''Raw'' to determine who would challenge Victoria for the title at WrestleMania. During the match, Victoria entered the ring and hit both women with the title belt, earning a double disqualification. It was then announced that Victoria would defend the title against both Stratus and Jazz in a triple threat match at the event.\n\nA smaller feud, also from the Raw brand was between [[Chris Jericho]] and [[Shawn Michaels]]. After Shawn Michaels lost the World Heavyweight Championship to Triple H at Armageddon, he appeared in an in-ring segment with Chris Jericho, during which Jericho stated Michaels was washed up. After mocking Michaels and threatening to attack him, Jericho turned around into a [[superkick]]. When Michaels was a guest on Jericho's in-ring show ''The Highlight Reel'' the following month, Jericho claimed he had idolized Michaels from a young age and that he had been his inspiration to become a wrestler. At the Royal Rumble, Jericho eliminated Michaels from the Royal Rumble match. Michaels returned later in the match and attacked Jericho, helping to lead to his elimination. The two agreed to meet at WrestleMania XIX in a match.\n\n== Event ==\n{| class=wikitable style=\"font-size:90%; margin: 0.5em 0 0.5em 1em; float: right; clear: right;\"\n|+ Other on-screen personnel<ref name=\"WMFacts\"/>\n!|Role:\n!|Name:\n|-\n|rowspan=4|English [[Sports commentator|commentators]]\n|[[Michael Cole (wrestling)|Michael Cole]] {{small|(SmackDown!)}}\n|-\n|[[Tazz]] {{small|(SmackDown!)}}\n|-\n|[[Jerry Lawler]] {{small|(Raw)}}\n|-\n|[[Jim Ross]] {{small|(Raw)}}\n|-\n|rowspan=2|Spanish commentators\n|[[Carlos Cabrera]]\n|-\n|[[Hugo Savinovich]]\n|-\n|rowspan=2|[[Interviewer]]s\n|[[Jonathan Coachman]]\n|-\n|[[Josh Mathews]]\n|-\n|rowspan=2|[[Ring announcer]]s\n|[[Howard Finkel]] {{small|(Raw)}}\n|-\n|[[Tony Chimel]] {{small|(SmackDown!)}}\n|-\n|rowspan=9|[[Referee (professional wrestling)|Referee]]s\n|[[Charles Robinson (referee)|Charles Robinson]] {{small|(Raw)}}\n|-\n|[[Nick Hamilton|Nick Patrick]] {{small|(Raw)}}\n|-\n|[[Jack Doan]] {{small|(Raw)}}\n|-\n|[[Earl Hebner]] {{small|(Raw)}}\n|-\n|Chad Patton {{small|(Raw)}}\n|-\n|[[Mike Chioda]] {{small|(SmackDown!)}}\n|-\n|[[Jim Korderas]] {{small|(SmackDown!)}}\n|-\n|[[Brian Hebner]] {{small|(SmackDown!)}}\n|-\n|Mike Sparks {{small|(SmackDown!)}}\n|}\n\n===Sunday Night Heat===\nBefore the event aired [[live television|live]] on [[pay-per-view]], [[Kane (wrestler)|Kane]] and [[Rob Van Dam]] faced [[Val Venis|Chief Morley]] and [[Lance Storm]] (with [[The Dudley Boyz]], ([[Bubba Ray Dudley]] and [[D-Von Dudley]])) for the [[World Tag Team Championship (WWE)|World Tag Team Championship]] on ''[[WWE Heat|Sunday Night Heat]]''.

He then told Hogan that he hated him for leaving WWE (then known as the WWF) for [[Ted Turner]]'s [[World Championship Wrestling]] (WCW) and for testifying against him in the [[Vince McMahon#Legal trial|steroid trial]] in the 1990s. McMahon proceeded by challenging Hogan to a match at WrestleMania where if Hogan lost, he would have to retire from [[professional wrestling]]. Hogan accepted his challenge later that night.<ref name=\"SDMar61\"/> Two weeks later on the March 20 episode of ''SmackDown!'', McMahon and Hogan had a contract signing for their match at WrestleMania. As Hogan was preparing to sign the contract, McMahon attacked with a steel chair from behind. Shortly afterward, McMahon hit Hogan several times with the chair in the head, causing him to [[Blading (professional wrestling)|bleed]].

He implied that Booker T, as a convicted criminal, would never win a world championship in WWE.

Then at Armageddon, Victoria defeated Stratus and Jacqueline in a [[Professional wrestling#Triple Threat match|triple threat match]] to retain the Women's Championship. Stratus and the returning Jazz had a match on ''Raw'' to determine who would challenge Victoria for the title at WrestleMania. During the match, Victoria entered the ring and hit both women with the title belt, earning a double disqualification. It was then announced that Victoria would defend the title against both Stratus and Jazz in a triple threat match at the event.\n\nA smaller feud, also from the Raw brand was between [[Chris Jericho]] and [[Shawn Michaels]]. After Shawn Michaels lost the World Heavyweight Championship to Triple H at Armageddon, he appeared in an in-ring segment with Chris Jericho, during which Jericho stated Michaels was washed up. After mocking Michaels and threatening to attack him, Jericho turned around into a [[superkick]]. When Michaels was a guest on Jericho's in-ring show ''The Highlight Reel'' the following month, Jericho claimed he had idolized Michaels from a young age and that he had been his inspiration to become a wrestler. At the Royal Rumble, Jericho eliminated Michaels from the Royal Rumble match. Michaels returned later in the match and attacked Jericho, helping to lead to his elimination.
