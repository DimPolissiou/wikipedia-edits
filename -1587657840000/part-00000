Dubbed \"The Orchid Lady of the Screen,\"{{sfn|Porter|2005|p=301}} she was widely regarded as one of the most beautiful actresses of the [[silent film]] era. In addition to her beauty, Griffith achieved critical recognition for her performance in [[Frank Lloyd]]'s ''[[The Divine Lady]]'' (1929), which earned her a nomination for the [[Academy Award for Best Actress]].\n\nA native of [[Texas]], Griffith pursued a film career after winning a beauty contest in Southern California. In 1916, she signed a contract with [[Vitagraph Studios]], appearing in numerous films for the studio through the remainder of the decade. In 1920, she began making films for [[First National Pictures]], and became one of the studio's bigger stars. In the mid-1920s, she began executive-producing features, and served as a producer on 1925's ''[[D\u00e9class\u00e9e]]'' and ''[[Classified (1925 film)|Classified]]'', in both of which she starred.\n\nIn the latter part of the 1920s, Griffith's film career slowed, though she had lead performances in ''[[Outcast (1928 film)|Outcast]]'' (1928) and the drama ''[[The Garden of Eden (1928 film)|The Garden of Eden]]'' (also 1928). The following year, she was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Actress for her performance in ''The Divine Lady''. She starred in ''[[Lilies of the Field (1930 film)|Lilies of the Field]]'', a remake of the [[Lilies of the Field (1924 film)|1924 film]] in which she had also starred. Her following film, ''[[Back Pay]]'' (1930), was promoted as Griffith's final screen appearance before her retirement. She did, however, appear as the lead in ''[[Lily Christine]]'', her first sound film, two years later.\n\nAfter 1932, Griffith retired from acting and became a successful author and businesswoman, writing numerous fiction and non-fiction books, as well as venturing into real estate, in which she had begun investing in the 1920s. She married her third husband, [[Washington Redskins]] owner [[George Preston Marshall]], in 1936, and remained married to him until 1958. She made her final film appearance with a minor role in ''Paradise Alley'' (1962), which marked her first screen appearance in 28 years. A biographical film about Griffith's life was released in 1963 titled ''[[Papa's Delicate Condition]]'', based on her 1952 memoir and focusing on the relationship between her and her father. After suffering a stroke in July 1979, Griffith was hospitalized in Santa Monica, California, where she died shortly after of a heart attack. She left behind a reported estate of $150 million, making her one of the wealthier women in the world at that time.{{sfn|Slide|2010|p=170}}\n\n==Biography==\n===1894\u20131932: Early life and Vitagraph films===\nGriffith was born Corinne Griffin on November 21, 1894{{efn|Some sources state Griffith was born November 24,<ref name=wfpp/> though biographer [[Anthony Slide]]{{sfn|Slide|2010|p=168}} as well as the [[National Museum of American History]]<ref>{{cite web|url=https://americanhistory.si.edu/collections/search/object/nmah_1464539|work=[[National Museum of American History]]|title=Corinne Griffith cinema card|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191010215121/https://americanhistory.si.edu/collections/search/object/nmah_1464539|archive-date=October 10, 2019|url-status=live}}</ref> among others{{sfn|Wilson|2016|p=300}} cite November 21 as her birthdate.

Dubbed \"The Orchid Lady of the Screen,\"{{sfn|Porter|2005|p=301}} she was widely regarded as one of the most beautiful actresses of the [[silent film]] era. In addition to her beauty, Griffith achieved critical recognition for her performance in [[Frank Lloyd]]'s ''[[The Divine Lady]]'' (1929), which earned her a nomination for the [[Academy Award for Best Actress]].\n\nA native of [[Texas]], Griffith pursued a film career after winning a beauty contest in Southern California. In 1916, she signed a contract with [[Vitagraph Studios]], appearing in numerous films for the studio through the remainder of the decade. In 1920, she began making films for [[First National Pictures]], and became one of the studio's bigger stars. In the mid-1920s, she began executive-producing features, and served as a producer on 1925's ''[[D\u00e9class\u00e9e]]'' and ''[[Classified (1925 film)|Classified]]'', in both of which she starred.\n\nIn the latter part of the 1920s, Griffith's film career slowed, though she had lead performances in ''[[Outcast (1928 film)|Outcast]]'' (1928) and the drama ''[[The Garden of Eden (1928 film)|The Garden of Eden]]'' (also 1928). The following year, she was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Actress for her performance in ''The Divine Lady''. She starred in ''[[Lilies of the Field (1930 film)|Lilies of the Field]]'', a remake of the [[Lilies of the Field (1924 film)|1924 film]] in which she had also starred. Her following film, ''[[Back Pay]]'' (1930), was promoted as Griffith's final screen appearance before her retirement. She did, however, appear as the lead in ''[[Lily Christine]]'', her first sound film, two years later.\n\nAfter 1932, Griffith retired from acting and became a successful author and businesswoman, writing numerous fiction and non-fiction books, as well as venturing into real estate, in which she had begun investing in the 1920s. She married her third husband, [[Washington Redskins]] owner [[George Preston Marshall]], in 1936, and remained married to him until 1958. She made her final film appearance with a minor role in ''Paradise Alley'' (1962), which marked her first screen appearance in 28 years. A biographical film about Griffith's life was released in 1963 titled ''[[Papa's Delicate Condition]]'', based on her 1952 memoir and focusing on the relationship between her and her father. After suffering a stroke in July 1979, Griffith was hospitalized in Santa Monica, California, where she died shortly after of a heart attack. She left behind a reported estate of $150 million, making her one of the wealthier women in the world at that time.{{sfn|Slide|2010|p=170}}\n\n==Biography==\n===1894\u20131932: Early life and Vitagraph films===\nGriffith was born Corinne Griffin on November 21, 1894{{efn|Some sources state Griffith was born November 24,<ref name=wfpp/> though biographer [[Anthony Slide]]{{sfn|Slide|2010|p=168}} as well as the [[National Museum of American History]]<ref>{{cite web|url=https://americanhistory.si.edu/collections/search/object/nmah_1464539|work=[[National Museum of American History]]|title=Corinne Griffith cinema card|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191010215121/https://americanhistory.si.edu/collections/search/object/nmah_1464539|archive-date=October 10, 2019|url-status=live}}</ref> among others{{sfn|Wilson|2016|p=300}} cite November 21 as her birthdate.

Built on the same platform as the fourth generation F-series trucks, the fifth generation had sharper styling lines, a larger cab and greenhouse, and expanded engine options.\n\nThree trim levels were available during the production of the fifth generation F-series, though the names were changed in 1970.  The \"Base\" trim became the \"Custom\" and the \"Custom Cab\" became the \"Sport Custom\" joining \"Ranger\" as optional levels of equipment and trim.  Late in production the Ranger trim level was upgraded with the additional \"Ranger XLT\" option.<ref>http://www.oldcarbrochures.com/static/NA/FMC%20Trucks-Vans/1967_Trucks-Vans/1967_Ford_Pickup_Brochure/1967%20Ford%20Pickup-05.html</ref>\n\n==Year by year changes==\n*'''1967''': Introduction of fifth-generation F-Series in 1966 for the 1967 model year.

Trim levels are \"Base\", \"Custom Cab\", and \"Ranger\".\n*'''1968''': As federal regulations required all automotive manufacturers to install side marker reflectors or lights, Ford redesigned the hood emblems to incorporate reflectors as well as added reflectors to the rear of the bed. Interior fittings changed due to new safety standards. New versions of the FE-Series engine added (360 truck and 390). First year of factory-installed air conditioning (air conditioning was installed by the dealer before 1968).\n*'''1969''': New grille design, new 302 Windsor V8 engine option.\n*'''1970''': Mid-cycle update with many detail changes including a completely new grille including wraparound front turn signals, exterior trim changes, and new side marker lights. \"Sport Custom\" trim replaces \"Custom Cab\", and \"Ranger XLT\" added as top trim level.\n\n===Argentina===\nA new engine choice to the local market is introduced in that year: the diesel engine, which was a [[Perkins_Engines|Perkins]] 3.3 L (203 cu in) l4 engine with 120&nbsp;hp SAE at 3,000 RPM.\nAlso, another change are the alternator, replacing the dynamo.\n\n===Mexico===\nThe new 335 cu in (5.4 L) V8 engine was introduced as a new engine option, only in medium duty trucks. This engine was designed by Mexican Ford engineers and was relative of the Windsor family and was based in the 351 and 302 ones, with a stronger crankshaft and elongated stroke. The 335 had a Holley 2-barrel carburetor and had an output of 200&nbsp;hp at 4,000 RPM. This engine co-existed with the 289 cu in V8 up to 1972.\n*'''1971''': New grille inserts, steering wheel design, and colors.  AM/FM radios are added as an option.\n*'''1972''': Final year of production (in North America).

Built on the same platform as the fourth generation F-series trucks, the fifth generation had sharper styling lines, a larger cab and greenhouse, and expanded engine options.\n\nThree trim levels were available during the production of the fifth generation F-series, though the names were changed in 1970.  The \"Base\" trim became the \"Custom\" and the \"Custom Cab\" became the \"Sport Custom\" joining \"Ranger\" as optional levels of equipment and trim.  Late in production the Ranger trim level was upgraded with the additional \"Ranger XLT\" option.<ref>http://www.oldcarbrochures.com/static/NA/FMC%20Trucks-Vans/1967_Trucks-Vans/1967_Ford_Pickup_Brochure/1967%20Ford%20Pickup-05.html</ref>\n\n==Year by year changes==\n*'''1967''': Introduction of fifth-generation F-Series in 1966 for the 1967 model year.  Cab is {{convert|3|in|cm}} wider than predecessor and frame is heavier.  Grille, exterior trim, interior cab fittings and engine choices are unique to this year.  Trim levels are \"Base\", \"Custom Cab\", and \"Ranger\".\n*'''1968''': As federal regulations required all automotive manufacturers to install side marker reflectors or lights, Ford redesigned the hood emblems to incorporate reflectors as well as added reflectors to the rear of the bed. Interior fittings changed due to new safety standards. New versions of the FE-Series engine added (360 truck and 390). First year of factory-installed air conditioning (air conditioning was installed by the dealer before 1968).\n*'''1969''': New grille design, new 302 Windsor V8 engine option.\n*'''1970''': Mid-cycle update with many detail changes including a completely new grille including wraparound front turn signals, exterior trim changes, and new side marker lights. \"Sport Custom\" trim replaces \"Custom Cab\", and \"Ranger XLT\" added as top trim level.\n\n===Argentina===\nA new engine choice to the local market is introduced in that year: the diesel engine, which was a [[Perkins_Engines|Perkins]] 3.3 L (203 cu in) l4 engine with 120&nbsp;hp SAE at 3,000 RPM.\nAlso, another change are the alternator, replacing the dynamo.\n\n===Mexico===\nThe new 335 cu in (5.4 L) V8 engine was introduced as a new engine option, only in medium duty trucks. This engine was designed by Mexican Ford engineers and was relative of the Windsor family and was based in the 351 and 302 ones, with a stronger crankshaft and elongated stroke. The 335 had a Holley 2-barrel carburetor and had an output of 200&nbsp;hp at 4,000 RPM. This engine co-existed with the 289 cu in V8 up to 1972.\n*'''1971''': New grille inserts, steering wheel design, and colors.  AM/FM radios are added as an option.\n*'''1972''': Final year of production (in North America). Minor detail changes and power brakes become a new option on upper level trim options.\n\n==Special models==\n[[File:1969 Ford F-100 Ranger 390, front left.jpg|thumb|left|1969 Ford F-100 Ranger]]\n[[File:69f100explorer.jpg|left|thumb|A 1969 Ford F-100 Explorer (Canada)]]\n[[File:1971 Ford F250 Camper Special.JPG|thumb|left|1971 F-250 Camper Special]]\nAfter 1968, Ford discontinued the '''\"Low GVWR\"''' versions. Still available was the '''Camper Special''' option (heavy duty cooling, camper pre-wiring, and larger alternator) along with the new '''Explorer Special''' (a limited edition trim and option package that combined many of the \"Ranger\" trim pieces with a lower overall price), '''Contractor's Special '''(including a behind the seat toolbox and 3/4 ton (F-250) suspension), '''Farm and Ranch Special '''(extra toolboxes and heavy springs), and '''Heavy-Duty Special '''(extra hauling abilities).
