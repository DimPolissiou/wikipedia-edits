A species of ctenophore, [[Mnemiopsis|Mnemiopsis leidei]], has had a negative impact on many of the economically important fishing industries in the Chesapeake Bay. However, due to the fact that ''C. chesapeakei'' regularly feeds on the ctenophores, this species has been kept in check.<ref name=\":1\" /> It is possible that as climate change becomes a greater issue, there may be fluctuations in the availability of the populations of both species. <ref>{{Cite journal|last=|first=|date=March 2009|title=Potential climate-change impacts on the Chesapeake Bay|url=https://www.nrs.fs.fed.us/pubs/jrnl/2010/nrs_2010_najjar_001.pdf|journal=Estuarine, Coastal and Shelf Science|volume=86|pages=|via=Elsevier Science Direct}}</ref>\n\n== Distribution ==\n[[File:1859 U.S. Coast Survey Chart or Map of the Chesapeake Bay - Geographicus - ChesapeakeBay-uscs-1859.jpg|left|thumb|105x105px|The Chesapeake Bay]]\n''C. chesapeakei'' can be found in several different types of water, including the open ocean, brackish water, bays, and estuaries.
