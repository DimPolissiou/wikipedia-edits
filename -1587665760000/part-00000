He started his career as a watchmaker and a few years later was articled to [[Alexander Kennedy Smith]], a renowned civil and mechanical engineer of the period.\nHe served as a sergeant in the Victorian Engineers under the command of Captain [[John_James_Clark |J. J. Clark]].\nBrennan invented the idea of a steerable [[torpedo]] in 1874, from observing that if a thread is pulled on a reel at an angle with suitable leverage, the reel will move away from the thread side. Brennan spent some years working out his invention, and received a grant of \u00a3700 from the [[Victoria, Australia|Victorian]] government towards his expenses. He patented the [[Brennan Torpedo]] in 1877. The idea was trialled at [[Camden Fort Meagher|Camden Fort]] near [[Crosshaven]], [[County Cork|Cork]], [[Republic of Ireland|Ireland]].<ref>{{cite journal |first=Walter |last=McGrath |year=1986 |journal=Journal of the Irish Railway Records Society |volume=16 |number=100 |pages=82\u201386 |issn= }}</ref>\n\nBrennan went to England in 1880 and brought his invention before the War Office. Sir [[Andrew Clarke (British Army officer, born 1824)|Andrew Clarke]] alerted the authorities to the possibilities of the torpedo if used in the defence of harbours and channels, and the patent was eventually bought for a sum believed to be more than \u00a3100,000 (\u00a3 {{formatnum:{{Inflation|UK|100000|1879|r=-2}}}} in {{CURRENTYEAR}}). In 1887 Brennan was appointed superintendent of the Brennan torpedo factory, and was consulting engineer 1896\u20131907.\n\n[[Image:Einschienerp.jpg|thumb|Brennan's gyroscopically balanced monorail on a demonstration run.]]\nHe did much work on a [[Gyro Monorail|monorail]] locomotive which was kept upright by a [[gyrostat]]. In 1903 he patented a [[Gyro Monorail|gyroscopically-balanced monorail]] system that he designed for military use; he successfully demonstrated the full sized system on 10 November 1909, at [[Gillingham, Medway|Gillingham]], [[England]]. At the [[Japan\u2013British Exhibition]] of 1910 at [[White City, London]] he built a mile long monorail track and gave rides for around 40 people at a time on his gyro stabilised 22-ton prototype. [[Winston Churchill]] (then Home Secretary) was one of the passengers and then drove the vehicle himself for one circuit. He was so impressed that he brought along the Prime Minister and other cabinet members and family to see it the following week. The exhibit was awarded the Grand Prize for the exhibition. Although the ability of the vehicle to balance itself on a single rail was amazing, especially when stationary, it was not to prove a commercial success, partly due to fears that the gyroscopes might fail, and partly because any wagons or coaches towed by the locomotive would also need powered gyroscopic stabilisation.<ref>{{cite web |publisher=The Monorail Society |url=http://www.monorails.org/tMspages/History.html |title=Monorails in History: Part I |accessdate=8 November 2005 }}</ref>\n\nFrom 1916 to 1919 Brennan served in the munitions inventions department.

In 1903 he patented a [[Gyro Monorail|gyroscopically-balanced monorail]] system that he designed for military use; he successfully demonstrated the full sized system on 10 November 1909, at [[Gillingham, Medway|Gillingham]], [[England]]. At the [[Japan\u2013British Exhibition]] of 1910 at [[White City, London]] he built a mile long monorail track and gave rides for around 40 people at a time on his gyro stabilised 22-ton prototype. [[Winston Churchill]] (then Home Secretary) was one of the passengers and then drove the vehicle himself for one circuit. He was so impressed that he brought along the Prime Minister and other cabinet members and family to see it the following week. The exhibit was awarded the Grand Prize for the exhibition. Although the ability of the vehicle to balance itself on a single rail was amazing, especially when stationary, it was not to prove a commercial success, partly due to fears that the gyroscopes might fail, and partly because any wagons or coaches towed by the locomotive would also need powered gyroscopic stabilisation.<ref>{{cite web |publisher=The Monorail Society |url=http://www.monorails.org/tMspages/History.html |title=Monorails in History: Part I |accessdate=8 November 2005 }}</ref>\n\nFrom 1916 to 1919 Brennan served in the munitions inventions department.

Due to the poor quality of radio parts Mr. Kikuchi had to deal with, he decided to start his private radio part manufacturer facility in December 1944 in Yoyogi, Tokyo. He picked transformers as his initial product line. Kikuchi's thought was \"Even with higher prices, let's make the higher quality of products.\"<ref>[http://www.tube-amps.net/Sansui_Early_History.htm tube-amps.net 2015-01-02, Sansui in Early Days], retrieved 2020-04-23.</ref> By the 1960s Sansui had developed a reputation for making serious audio components. They were sold in foreign markets through that and the next decade. Sansui's amplifiers and tuners from the 1960s and 1970s remain in demand by audio enthusiasts<ref name=audiocircuit/>\n\nIn 1971, Sansui introduced the Quadphonic Synthesizer QS-1, which could make simulated four channel stereo from two channel sources. Sansui developed the [[QS Regular Matrix]] system, which made it possible to transmit four channel [[Quadraphonic]] sound from a standard LP. The channel separation was only 3&nbsp;dB, but because of the human way of hearing it sounded relatively good. In 1973, Sansui introduced the more advanced QS Vario Matrix decoder with 20&nbsp;dB separation. Unfortunately the [[Stereo Quadraphonic|SQ]] system developed by  Columbia/[[CBS]] was the most popular matrix system. But later QS decoders could also play SQ records. Some Sansui receivers could also play the most advanced four channel system - [[Compatible Discrete 4|CD-4]] (or Quadradisc) by Japanese [[JVC]] and American [[RCA]]. Most big record companies used either SQ or CD-4, but [[Decca Records|Decca]] used the Sansui QS system.\n\nIn 1974 Kosaku Kikuchi resigned, vice-president Kenzo Fujiwara became president.<ref>[https://books.google.de/books?id=swcEAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA4&lpg=PA4&dq=Leben+Kosaku+Kikuchi++Sansui&source=bl&ots=Zr3rwstVZh&sig=ACfU3U0SskFJn4kiLWlRHNRQhFn20yMhbA&hl=de&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwic14SiuffoAhUB36QKHTXKAz8Q6AEwEnoECAwQQQ#v=onepage&q=Leben%20Kosaku%20Kikuchi%20%20Sansui&f=false Billboard 1974-10-26, page 4; at Google Books], retrieved 2020-04-22.</ref>\n\nDuring the late 1970s, the iconic matte-black-faced AU-series amplifiers were released. The first-generation '07' models included the dual-mono power supply AU-517 and AU-717, and the second generation featured the updated AU-719, 819 and 919. The separate pre-amp/power-amp CA-F1/BA-F1 topped the model range along with the AU-X1 integrated amplifier.\n\nIn the UK around 1982, the Sansui AU-D101 amplifier and its more powerful sibling the AU-D33,<ref>Bigger version AU-D55, https://audio-database.com/SANSUI/amp/au-d55f-e.html , retrieved 2020-04-22.</ref> were highly acclaimed by audiophiles{{citation needed|date=April 2013}} and were so well matched{{citation needed|date=April 2013}} to a pair of [[KEF]] Coda III speakers that they could be bought as a set from some outlets.<ref name=audiocircuit/> These amplifiers used a complex [[Feed forward (control)|feed-forward]] servo system which resulted in very low 2nd order [[harmonic]] [[distortion]].  Despite this success, Sansui completely failed to follow up with further mass market [[audiophile]] components.<ref name=audiocircuit/>\n\nAs the mid-1980s arrived, sales were lost to competitors ([[Sony]], [[Pioneer Corporation|Pioneer]], [[Panasonic Corporation|Matsushita]]'s [[Technics (brand)|Technics]]).<ref name=audiocircuit/> Sansui began to lose visibility in the [[United States]] around 1988, and then focused on manufacturing high-end components in Japan.<ref name=audiocircuit/> The company began to manufacture high-end television sets and other video equipment, but ceased exportation. In the late 1990s, the company's brand was used on video equipment manufactured by other companies. The current manufacturer of the rebranded sets is [[Orion Electric]], based in [[Osaka]] and [[Fukui, Fukui|Fukui]], Japan. Its U.S. subsidiary markets products under the Sansui brand, among others. Sansui is thus a mere [[umbrella brand]] at present.

Due to the poor quality of radio parts Mr. Kikuchi had to deal with, he decided to start his private radio part manufacturer facility in December 1944 in Yoyogi, Tokyo. He picked transformers as his initial product line. Kikuchi's thought was \"Even with higher prices, let's make the higher quality of products.\"<ref>[http://www.tube-amps.net/Sansui_Early_History.htm tube-amps.net 2015-01-02, Sansui in Early Days, retrieved 2020-04-23.</ref> By the 1960s Sansui had developed a reputation for making serious audio components. They were sold in foreign markets through that and the next decade. Sansui's amplifiers and tuners from the 1960s and 1970s remain in demand by audio enthusiasts<ref name=audiocircuit/>\n\nIn 1971, Sansui introduced the Quadphonic Synthesizer QS-1, which could make simulated four channel stereo from two channel sources. Sansui developed the [[QS Regular Matrix]] system, which made it possible to transmit four channel [[Quadraphonic]] sound from a standard LP. The channel separation was only 3&nbsp;dB, but because of the human way of hearing it sounded relatively good. In 1973, Sansui introduced the more advanced QS Vario Matrix decoder with 20&nbsp;dB separation. Unfortunately the [[Stereo Quadraphonic|SQ]] system developed by  Columbia/[[CBS]] was the most popular matrix system. But later QS decoders could also play SQ records. Some Sansui receivers could also play the most advanced four channel system - [[Compatible Discrete 4|CD-4]] (or Quadradisc) by Japanese [[JVC]] and American [[RCA]]. Most big record companies used either SQ or CD-4, but [[Decca Records|Decca]] used the Sansui QS system.\n\nIn 1974 Kosaku Kikuchi resigned, vice-president Kenzo Fujiwara became president.<ref>[https://books.google.de/books?id=swcEAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA4&lpg=PA4&dq=Leben+Kosaku+Kikuchi++Sansui&source=bl&ots=Zr3rwstVZh&sig=ACfU3U0SskFJn4kiLWlRHNRQhFn20yMhbA&hl=de&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwic14SiuffoAhUB36QKHTXKAz8Q6AEwEnoECAwQQQ#v=onepage&q=Leben%20Kosaku%20Kikuchi%20%20Sansui&f=false Billboard 1974-10-26, page 4; at Google Books], retrieved 2020-04-22.</ref>\n\nDuring the late 1970s, the iconic matte-black-faced AU-series amplifiers were released. The first-generation '07' models included the dual-mono power supply AU-517 and AU-717, and the second generation featured the updated AU-719, 819 and 919. The separate pre-amp/power-amp CA-F1/BA-F1 topped the model range along with the AU-X1 integrated amplifier.\n\nIn the UK around 1982, the Sansui AU-D101 amplifier and its more powerful sibling the AU-D33,<ref>Bigger version AU-D55, https://audio-database.com/SANSUI/amp/au-d55f-e.html , retrieved 2020-04-22.</ref> were highly acclaimed by audiophiles{{citation needed|date=April 2013}} and were so well matched{{citation needed|date=April 2013}} to a pair of [[KEF]] Coda III speakers that they could be bought as a set from some outlets.<ref name=audiocircuit/> These amplifiers used a complex [[Feed forward (control)|feed-forward]] servo system which resulted in very low 2nd order [[harmonic]] [[distortion]].  Despite this success, Sansui completely failed to follow up with further mass market [[audiophile]] components.<ref name=audiocircuit/>\n\nAs the mid-1980s arrived, sales were lost to competitors ([[Sony]], [[Pioneer Corporation|Pioneer]], [[Panasonic Corporation|Matsushita]]'s [[Technics (brand)|Technics]]).<ref name=audiocircuit/> Sansui began to lose visibility in the [[United States]] around 1988, and then focused on manufacturing high-end components in Japan.<ref name=audiocircuit/> The company began to manufacture high-end television sets and other video equipment, but ceased exportation. In the late 1990s, the company's brand was used on video equipment manufactured by other companies. The current manufacturer of the rebranded sets is [[Orion Electric]], based in [[Osaka]] and [[Fukui, Fukui|Fukui]], Japan. Its U.S. subsidiary markets products under the Sansui brand, among others. Sansui is thus a mere [[umbrella brand]] at present.
