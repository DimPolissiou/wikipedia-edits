There were two weather delays in the first half which effectively made it a night game. It ended up being a back-and-forth contest with Iowa kicker Keith Duncan hitting four crucial field goals to keep the Hawkeyes in the game. Iowa held the Cyclones on a critical fourth down, however Iowa State still had a chance with over a minute in regulation. An Iowa state player ran into his teammate attempting to field the punt and it resulted in a muffed ball that Iowa pounced on. With the Cyclones having spent all their timeouts already, the Hawkeyes were simply able to run out the clock and the Cy-Hawk trophy remained in Iowa City for a fifth year in a row.\n\n<ref>{{cite web | publisher=[[Iowa Hawkeyes|University of Iowa Athletics]] | title=Game Notes: Iowa Corn Cy-Hawk Series | url=https://hawkeyesports.com/news/2019/9/9/football-game-notes-iowa-corn-cy-hawk-series.aspx | date=September 9, 2019 | access-date=September 15, 2019 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web | publisher=[[Associated Press]] | title=No. 19 Iowa rallies to beat Iowa State, 18-17 | url=https://apnews.com/7c9f1a126bb54b5ab902f654a2dbee50 | date=September 14, 2019 | access-date=September 15, 2019 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web | publisher=[[Big Ten Network]] | title=Keith Duncan, 5 first-time winners claim Week 3 individual honors | url=https://btn.com/2019/09/16/keith-duncan-5-first-time-winners-claim-week-3-individual-honors/ | date=September 16, 2019 | access-date=November 18, 2019 }}</ref>\n\n{{-}}\n\n===Middle Tennessee===\n{{see also|2019 Middle Tennessee Blue Raiders football team}}\n{{AFB game box start\n| Title = '''Middle Tennessee at Iowa'''\n| Visitor = Blue Raiders\n| V1=0 |V2=0 |V3=3 |V4=0\n| Host = '''No. 14 Hawkeyes'''\n| H1=17 |H2=7 |H3=10 |H4=14\n| Date = September 28\n| Location = <br>[[Kinnick Stadium]]<br>[[Iowa City, Iowa|Iowa City, IA]]\n| StartTime = 11:01\n| TimeZone = CDT\n| ElapsedTime = 3:06\n| Attendance = 63,706\n| Weather = 61&deg; F, Overcast, Wind NE 12 mph\n| Referee = Ron Snodgrass\n| TVAnnouncers = Kevin Brown (play-by-play), [[Andre Ware]] (analyst)\n| TVStation = [[ESPN2]]\n}}\n*'''Source''': [https://hawkeyesports.com/boxscore.aspx?id=12320 Box Score]\n{{AFB game box scoring entry |FirstEntry=yes|Quarter=1 |QuarterEntries=3 |Time=11:01 |Team=Iowa |Event=Mekhi Sargent 4-yard run (Keith Duncan kick) |Score=Iowa 7\u20130 }}\n{{AFB game box scoring entry |Time=4:54 |Team=Iowa |Event=Keith Duncan 49-yard field goal |Score=Iowa 10\u20130 }}\n{{AFB game box scoring entry |Time=0:15 |Team=Iowa |Event=Brandon Smith 18-yard pass from Nate Stanley (Keith Duncan kick) |Score=Iowa 17\u20130 }}\n{{AFB game box scoring entry |Quarter=2 |QuarterEntries=1 |Time=8:33 |Team=Iowa |Event=Brady Ross 1-yard run (Keith Duncan kick) |Score=Iowa 24\u20130 }}\n{{AFB game box scoring entry |Quarter=3 |QuarterEntries=3 |Time=10:52 |Team=Iowa |Event=Keith Duncan 42-yard field goal |Score=Iowa 27\u20130 }}\n{{AFB game box scoring entry |Time=5:24 |Team=MTSU |Event=Crews Holt 43-yard field goal |Score=Iowa 27\u20133 }}\n{{AFB game box scoring entry |Time=2:19 |Team=Iowa |Event=Ihmir Smith-Marsette 14-yard run (Keith Duncan kick) |Score=Iowa 34\u20133 }}\n{{AFB game box scoring entry |Quarter=4 |QuarterEntries=2 |Time=10:01 |Team=Iowa |Event=Brandon Smith 10-yard pass from Nate Stanley (Keith Duncan kick) |Score=Iowa 41\u20133 }}\n{{AFB game box scoring entry |Time=0:47 |Team=Iowa |Event=Spencer Petras 1-yard run (Keith Duncan kick) |Score='''Iowa 48\u20133''' |LastEntry=yes}}\n{{AFB game box end}}\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|- align=\"center\"\n{{CollegePrimaryHeader|team=Iowa Hawkeyes|Overall record|Last meeting|Result}}\n|- align=\"center\"\n| colspan=3 |''First meeting''\n|}\n\nThe Hawkeyes put up 644 yards of total offense (tops in the Ferentz era) as the Blue Raiders were unable to stop them.

The family moved to Missouri around 1845, and shortly after, William, along with three of his brothers, took the [[Oregon Trail]] West to [[Laramie, Wyoming]], where the oldest brother, John, died of [[Cholera]].<ref>Johnston, p. 10-11.</ref>\n\nExactly how and when the brothers made their way to California is not certain, but the next documented story relating to William takes place in [[Sonoma, California]].

Bradshaw\u2019s own accounts have been viewed with skepticism.<ref>Johnston, pp. 17-18.</ref> His description of the flag, both the size and the motto, do not agree with what is known about the actual flag.  Whatever his role in the Bear Flag Rebellion, the following account of Bradshaw was reported in the Pacific Echo newspaper on September 7, 1861;\n\n:''\u201cIn 1846, a party of 33 men took the post of Sonoma; the Mexican flag was taken down, and it was proposed that we should have a flag of our own.  I went to Marcus Baca\u2019s store and bought nine yards of bleached domestic; this was torn in twain and sewed together, making a flag 6 feet broad and 13 \u00bd feet long, upon which Wm. Todd and myself painted a bear, a lone star, and wrote the words \u201cThe Invincible.\u201d  After we were disbanded, most of us joined Uncle Sam, and having the greater right in the flag, I made a present of it to the son of Capt.

Bradshaw\u2019s own accounts have been viewed with skepticism.<ref>Johnston, pp. 17-18.</ref> His description of the flag, both the size and the motto, do not agree with what is known about the actual flag.  Whatever his role in the Bear Flag Rebellion, the following account of Bradshaw was reported in the Pacific Echo newspaper on September 7, 1861;\n\n:''\u201cIn 1846, a party of 33 men took the post of Sonoma; the Mexican flag was taken down, and it was proposed that we should have a flag of our own.  I went to Marcus Baca\u2019s store and bought nine yards of bleached domestic; this was torn in twain and sewed together, making a flag 6 feet broad and 13 \u00bd feet long, upon which Wm. Todd and myself painted a bear, a lone star, and wrote the words \u201cThe Invincible.\u201d  After we were disbanded, most of us joined Uncle Sam, and having the greater right in the flag, I made a present of it to the son of Capt. Montgomery, of the Portsmouth, then laying in the harbor at Yerba Buena.\u201d'' -- Wm. D. Bradshaw<ref>{{cite news |last1=Bradshaw |first1=Wm.

Its powers and responsibilities are derived from Buffalo's [https://ecode360.com/11767343 Preservation Ordinance], which declares \"as a matter of public policy that preservation, protection, conservation, enhancement, perpetuation, and utilization of sites, buildings, improvements, and districts of special character, historical or aesthetic interest, or value are necessary and required in the interest of the health, education, culture, prosperity, safety, and high quality of life of the people.\"\n\n== Designation Criteria ==\nThe City of Buffalo designates landmarks and historic districts according to a process and criteria established in the Preservation Ordinance. The Preservation Board makes a recommendation, and the Common Council makes a decision, as to whether a proposed landmark, landmark site, or historic district meets one or more of the following criteria:\n\n# It has character, interest, or value as part of the development, heritage, or cultural characteristics of the city, state, or nation.\n# Its location is a site of a significant local, state, or national event.\n# It exemplifies the historic, aesthetic, architectural, archaeological, educational, economic, or cultural heritage of the city, state, or nation.\n# It is identified with a person or persons who significantly contributed to the development of the city, state, or nation.\n# It embodies distinguishing characteristics of an architectural style valuable for the study of a period, type, method of construction, or use of indigenous materials.\n# It is the work of a master builder, engineer, designer, architect, or landscape architect whose individual work has influenced the development of the city, state, or nation.\n# It embodies elements of design, detailing, materials, or craftsmanship that render it architecturally significant.\n# It embodies elements that make it structurally or architecturally innovative.\n# It is a unique location or contains singular physical characteristics that make it an established or familiar visual feature within the city.\n\nAny structure, property, or area that meets one or more of the above criteria must also have sufficient integrity of location, design, materials, and workmanship to make it worthy of preservation or restoration.\n\n== Project Review ==\nOnce the City of Buffalo has designated a landmark or historic district, the designated property or properties fall under the purview of the Preservation Board.

He was known as Lal Sahib (\"Friend of God\") by his  followers.<ref name=Joo>{{cite web|url=http://www.koausa.org/Saints/LakshmanJoo/index.html|title=Swami Lakshmanjoo|accessdate=2008-02-28}}</ref>\n\n== Biography ==\nLakshman Joo was born in the city of [[Srinagar]] in [[Kashmir]]. He was the fifth child in a household of four boys and five girls. His father, Narayandas (\"Nav Narayan\") Raina, was the first person to have introduced [[houseboat]]s in the [[Kashmir Valley]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.searchkashmir.org/2010/10/origin-of-kashmiri-house-boat-and-some.html|title=Search Kashmir - in bits and pieces.|last=Razdan|first=Vinayak|date=10 October 2010|website=Origin of Kashmir|publisher=Search Kashmir|access-date= 29 March 2016}}</ref>{{citation needed|date=November 2015}} His mother's name was Arnyamali Raina.\n\nAt the age of five he was introduced to the path of spirituality by his elder brother Maheshvaranath. Up to the age of eight his spiritual progress in the lineage of [[Kashmir Shaivism|Kashmiri Shaivam]] was monitored by his family priest, [[Pandit]] Swami Ram Joo (1854-1915), and later by his chief disciple Swami Mehatab Kak (1870?-1942). At the age of 19, it is said, he experienced a clear taste of [[Self-realisation]]. Shortly afterwards he left home, as he wrote, \"in search of the Supreme\" and moved to the famous [[ashram]] of Sadhamalyun (Sadhuganga) in [[Handwara]]. Persuaded by his father to return to Srinagar, he continued to study [[Sanskrit]] and [[Shaiva philosophy]] under the guidance of a scholar named Maheshwar Razdan.\n\nIn 1934-35, he moved to an isolated place above the village of Gupta Ganga near [[Nishat]] suburb of [[Srinagar]] where his parents built him a house. This was a place where [[Abhinavagupta]] had lived nine centuries before. In 1962 he moved down the hill to a place closer to the famous [[Dal Lake]] a few hundred metres from the [[Nishat Gardens]].\n\nAround the age of 30 he travelled in India, spending time on a [[Bombay]] beach and a short time with [[Mahatma Gandhi]] at [[Sevagram]] and then with [[Sri Aurobindo]] at [[Pondicherry]]. From there he found his way to [[Tiruvannamalai]] to meet [[Ramana Maharshi]]. There he spent some weeks and later commented; \"I felt those golden days were indeed divine\".\n\nLittle was known about the Swami for almost three decades (1930-1960), as it was his habit to spend the winter months in silence and seclusion. Still, in the summer he had occasional visits from both scholars and saints. The Indian Spiritual Master [[Meher Baba]] visited his ashram in 1944. In 1948 [[Lilian Silburn]] from the [[National Centre for Scientific Research]], Paris, visited the Swami. She would return regularly for the next ten years, during which time she studied the major texts of Kashmir Shaiva philosophy, all of which were published in French. It was through Silburn that [[Andr\u00e9 Padoux]], another prolific scholar of Kashmir Shaivism came to meet the Swami. [[Paul Reps]], the American artist, author and poet stumbled across the Ashram in 1957. With Swami Lakshmanjoo he studied the ancient text of ''[[Vijnana Bhairava Tantra]]'', and later published the 112 practices of transcending in the fourth chapter of his book ''[[Zen Flesh, Zen Bones]]''. This teaching also influenced [[Rajneesh|Osho]], and formed the basis of ''The Book of Secrets''. It was a few years later, in 1965, after attending a Sanskrit conference in [[Varanasi]], chaired by the renowned Sanskrit Tantra scholar [[Gopinath Kaviraj]], that the word quickly spread that the tradition of Kashmir Shaivism was alive and well, and fully embodied in the person of Swami Lakshmanjoo. [[Maharishi Mahesh Yogi]] visited the Swami each summer from 1966 to 1969. The two saints formed a lasting relationship. Baba [[Muktananda]], of [[Siddha Yoga]] also visited on two occasions. Until his death in 1991, Swami Lakshmanjoo freely taught, giving  weekly lectures on the mystical and philosophical texts of Kashmir Shaivism.  Many of these lectures were audio recorded by John Hughes and later published. Lakshman Joo's interpretation of Kashmir Shavism attracted the attention of both Indian of western [[Indologist]]s. The Swami has correspondence with Professor [[Giuseppe Tucci]] of the [[University of Rome La Sapienza]], and his regular visitors included scholars, such as, [[Jaideva Singh]], [[Professor Nilkanth Gurtoo]], [[Acharya Rameshwar Jha]], [[Jankinath Kaul|Jankinath Kaul \"Kamal\"]], [[Raniero Gnoli]], [[Alexis Sanderson]] and [[Mark Dyczkowski]]. \n\nIn 1991 the Swami traveled to the United States and established the Universal Shaiva Fellowship where he designated John Hughes and his wife Denise to continue publishing his teachings of Kashmir Shaivism. In India the teachings of Lakshman Joo are carried on by a local organisation Ishwar Ashram Trust which was founded by him.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.oneindia.com/2006/10/27/swami-lakshmanjoos-birth-centenary-celebtns-to-commence-from-to-tom-1161959813.html |title=Swami Lakshmanjoo's birth centenary |publisher=One India |date=27 October 2006 |accessdate=3 February 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://news.webindia123.com/news/articles/India/20060925/460681.html |title=International seminar on Kashmir Shaivism in Srinagar |publisher=Webindia123.com |date=25 September 2006 |accessdate=3 February 2017}}</ref>\n\nThe very same year by virtue of the will of Swami Lakshmanjoo, Ishwar Ashram Trust was established. Ishwar Ashram Trust is presently engaged in spreading the message and knowledge of Kashmir Shaivism as mandated my Swami Lakshmanjoo.

The Swami has correspondence with Professor [[Giuseppe Tucci]] of the [[University of Rome La Sapienza]], and his regular visitors included scholars, such as, [[Jaideva Singh]], [[Professor Nilkanth Gurtoo]], [[Acharya Rameshwar Jha]], [[Jankinath Kaul|Jankinath Kaul \"Kamal\"]], [[Raniero Gnoli]], [[Alexis Sanderson]] and [[Mark Dyczkowski]]. \n\nIn 1991 the Swami traveled to the United States and established the Universal Shaiva Fellowship where he designated John Hughes and his wife Denise to continue publishing his teachings of Kashmir Shaivism. In India the teachings of Lakshman Joo are carried on by a local organisation Ishwar Ashram Trust which was founded by him.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.oneindia.com/2006/10/27/swami-lakshmanjoos-birth-centenary-celebtns-to-commence-from-to-tom-1161959813.html |title=Swami Lakshmanjoo's birth centenary |publisher=One India |date=27 October 2006 |accessdate=3 February 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://news.webindia123.com/news/articles/India/20060925/460681.html |title=International seminar on Kashmir Shaivism in Srinagar |publisher=Webindia123.com |date=25 September 2006 |accessdate=3 February 2017}}</ref>\n\nThe very same year by virtue of the will of Swami Lakshmanjoo, Ishwar Ashram Trust was established.

Known as \"Rabbeinu\" (our teacher), he acquired the Hebrew [[Suffix (name)|suffix]] \"Tam\" meaning straightforward; it was originally used in the [[Book of Genesis]] to describe his biblical namesake, [[Jacob]].\n\n== Biography ==\n\nJacob ben Meir was born in the French country village of [[Ramerupt]], in the [[Aube]] [[d\u00e9partement]] of northern-central [[France]], to [[Meir ben Shmuel]] and Yocheved, [[Rashi's daughters|daughter of Rashi]]. His primary teachers were his father and his brother, [[Rashbam|Shmuel ben Meir]], known as [[Rashbam]]. His other brothers were Isaac, known as the [[Rivam]], and Solomon the Grammarian. He married Miriam, the sister of R. Shimshon ben Yosef of [[Falaise, Calvados]], who may have been his second wife.\n\nHis reputation as a legal scholar spread far beyond France. [[Avraham ibn Daud]], the [[Spanish people|Spanish]] chronicler of the sages, mentioned Rabbeinu Tam in his ''[[Sefer ha-Qabbalah|Sefer HaKabbalah]]'', but not Rashi. The Italian Mishnaic exegete, Rabbi [[Isaac ben Melchizedek]] of [[Siponto]], maintained a written correspondence with Rabbeinu Tam.<ref>\"Or Zarua',\" ii., \u00a7 52</ref> Rabbeinu Tam's work is also cited by Rabbi Zerachya HaLevi, a [[Provence|Proven\u00e7al]] critic. He maintained a scholarly correspondence with [[Aaron ben Joseph of Beaugency]] and received questions from students throughout France and from the [[Italy|Italian]] communities of [[Bari]] and [[Otranto]].\n\nRabbeinu Tam gave his [[Beth Din]] the title of \"the generation's [most] significant court\", and indeed, he is known for communal enactments improving Jewish family life, education, and women's status. At times, he criticised Halakhic opponents, notably in his controversies with Meshullam of [[Melun]] and Efraim of [[Regensburg]].\n\n== Halakhic disputes ==\n=== Tefillin Argument ===\nLegend has it that when [[Rashi]] was holding his infant grandson, the baby touched the [[tefillin]] that were on Rashi's head. Rashi predicted that this grandson would later disagree with him about the order of the scripts that are put in the head [[tefillin]]. Regardless of the episode's veracity, Rabbeinu Tam did disagree with the opinion of his antecedent. Today, both \"Rashi tefillin\" and \"Rabbeinu Tam tefillin\" are produced: the ''[[Shulchan Aruch]]'' requires wearing Rashi's version and recommends that God-fearing Jews wear both in order to satisfy both halakhic opinions. However:<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.tzemachdovid.org/thepracticaltorah/bo.shtml|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070713184523/http://www.tzemachdovid.org/thepracticaltorah/bo.shtml|url-status=dead|title=Parshas Bo: Rabbeinu Tam Tefillin|archive-date=July 13, 2007|website=www.tzemachdovid.org}}</ref> {{quote|\"It is worth noting that the Shulchan Aruch ... rules that Rabbeinu Tam Tefillin should be worn only by one who is known to be a very pious person; the [[Mishnah Berurah]] ... explains that it is a sign of haughtiness for anyone else to do this because the accepted practice is to wear Rashi Tefillin.\"}}\n\nHowever, many [[Sephardi Jews|Sephardic]] and [[chasidism|chasidic]] Jews<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.stam.net/what_is_stam.aspx |title=Torah scrolls, Sefer Torah projects, tefillin, mezuzah scrolls & Megillah scrolls from Israel |publisher=Stam.net |access-date=2013-04-05}}</ref> wear Rabbeinu Tam's Tefillin (in addition to wearing Rashi's) per opinions presented in the ''Shulchan Aruch'' and its extensive commentaries authored throughout the early-modern and modern era. The rise and articulation of chasidic philosophy has conflated the kabbalistic and halakhic aspects of Rabbeinu Tam's position, popularizing the custom to wear both pairs every day. Wearing Rabbeinu Tam tefillin is an almost universal custom among the many and diverse communities that follow the teachings of the [[Baal Shem Tov]] and his students.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.biu.ac.il/JH/Parasha/ekev/eli.html|title=\u05e9\u05e0\u05d9 \u05d6\u05d5\u05d2\u05d5\u05ea \u05ea\u05e4\u05d9\u05dc\u05d9\u05df|website=www.biu.ac.il|author=\u05de\u05e0\u05e9\u05d4 \u05d0\u05dc\u05d9\u05e9\u05d9\u05d1|language=he}}</ref>\n\n=== Mezuzah Placement Argument ===\nAnother halakhic disagreement between Rabbeinu Tam and Rashi concerns the placement of the [[mezuzah]]. Rashi rules that it should be mounted on the doorpost in a vertical position; Rabbeinu Tam holds that it should be mounted horizontally. In a compromise solution, many [[Ashkenazi]] Jews place the mezuzah on the door in a slanted position.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.faqs.org/faqs/judaism/FAQ/03-Torah-Halacha/section-61.html |title=soc.culture.jewish FAQ: Torah and Halachic Authority (3/12)Section \u2013 Question 4.12: Who was Rabbeinu Tam? |publisher=Faqs.org |date=2012-08-08 |access-date=2013-04-05}}</ref> Sephardi Jews mount the mezuzah vertically, per the opinions of Rashi, [[Maimonides]], and the ''Shulchan Aruch''.\n\n== Liturgical poet ==\n\nIn the field of Hebrew poetry the importance of R. Tam is not slight. He was influenced by the poetry of the Spaniards, and is the chief representative of the transition period, in Christian lands, from the old \"payye\u1e6danic\" mode of expression to the more graceful forms of the Spanish school. According to Zunz,<ref>Zunz, ''Literaturgesch.'' pp.&nbsp;265 et seq.</ref> he composed the following pieces for the synagogue: (1) several poems for the evening prayer of [[Sukkot]] and of [[Shemini Atzeret]]; (2) a hymn for the close of Sabbath on which a wedding is celebrated; (3) a hymn for the replacing of the [[Torah]] rolls in the Ark on [[Simchat Torah]]; (4) an \"ofan\" in four metric strophes;<ref>see Luzzatto in ''Kerem \u1e24emed'', vii.35</ref> (5) four [[Aramaic]] ''reshut''; (6) two ''selichot'' (the second is reproduced by Zunz in ''S.P.'' p.&nbsp;248, in German verse).<ref>see also \"Nachalat SHeDaL\" in Berliner's ''Magazin'' [\"O\u1e93ar \u1e6cob\"], 1880, p.&nbsp;36.</ref> It must, however, be remarked that there was a synagogal poet by the name of Jacob ben Me\u00efr (Levi) who might easily have been confounded with the subject of this article, and therefore Tam's authorship of all of these poems is not above doubt.<ref>See [[Landshuth]], \"'Ammude ha-'Abodah\", p.&nbsp;106; comp. also Harkavy, \"\u1e24adashim gam Yeshanim\", supplement to the Hebrew edition of Graetz, \"Hist.\" v. 39; Brody, \"\u1e32un\u1e6dras ha-Piyyu\u1e6dim\", p.&nbsp;72</ref>\n\nThe short poems which sometimes precede his ''[[responsa]]'' also show great poetic talent and a pure Hebrew style (see Bacher in ''Monatsschrift'', xliv.56 et seq.). When [[Abraham ibn Ezra]] was traveling through France R. Tam greeted him in verse, whereupon Ibn Ezra exclaimed in astonishment: \"Who has admitted the French into the temple of poetry?\" (''Kerem \u1e24emed'', vii.35). Another work of his in metric form is his poem on the accents, which contains forty-five strophes riming in; it is found in various libraries (Padua, Hamburg, Parma), and is entitled ''Ma\u1e25beret.'' Luzzatto has given the first four strophes in ''Kerem \u1e24emed'' (vii.38), and Halberstam has printed the whole poem in Kobak's \"Jeschurun\" (v.123).\n\n== Gravesite ==\n\nRabbeinu Tam and his brothers, the Rashbam and the Rivam, as well as other Tosafists, were buried in Ramerupt. The unmarked, ancient cemetery in which they are buried lies adjacent to a street called Street of the Great Cemetery. In 2005, Rabbi [[Yisroel Meir Gabbai]], a [[Breslov (Hasidic dynasty)|Breslover]] [[Hasidic Judaism|Hasid]] who renovates and repairs neglected gravesites of Jewish leaders around the world, helped to determine the exact boundaries of the cemetery. In addition, a member of the Jewish religious community in [[Paris]] bought a house at the site and converted it into a [[beth midrash]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://chareidi.shemayisrael.com/archives5764/VYC64features.htm |title=A Man with a Grave Mission \u2013 Part I |last=Friedman |first=Yisroel |date=7 January 2004 |access-date=28 December 2010 |publisher=Dei'ah VeDibur |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091230162815/http://chareidi.shemayisrael.com/archives5764/VYC64features.htm |archive-date=30 December 2009}}</ref>\n\n== Works ==\n\nRabbeinu Tam's best known work is ''Sefer HaYashar'', which contained both ''[[novellae]]'' and ''responsa'', its main purpose to resolve Talmudic textual problems without resorting to emendations of the received text.

Known as \"Rabbeinu\" (our teacher), he acquired the Hebrew [[Suffix (name)|suffix]] \"Tam\" meaning straightforward; it was originally used in the [[Book of Genesis]] to describe his biblical namesake, [[Jacob]].\n\n== Biography ==\n\nJacob ben Meir was born in the French country village of [[Ramerupt]], in the [[Aube]] [[d\u00e9partement]] of northern-central [[France]], to [[Meir ben Shmuel]] and Yocheved, [[Rashi's daughters|daughter of Rashi]]. His primary teachers were his father and his brother, [[Rashbam|Shmuel ben Meir]], known as [[Rashbam]]. His other brothers were Isaac, known as the [[Rivam]], and Solomon the Grammarian. He married Miriam, the sister of R. Shimshon ben Yosef of [[Falaise, Calvados]], who may have been his second wife.\n\nHis reputation as a legal scholar spread far beyond France. [[Avraham ibn Daud]], the [[Spanish people|Spanish]] chronicler of the sages, mentioned Rabbeinu Tam in his ''[[Sefer ha-Qabbalah|Sefer HaKabbalah]]'', but not Rashi. The Italian Mishnaic exegete, Rabbi [[Isaac ben Melchizedek]] of [[Siponto]], maintained a written correspondence with Rabbeinu Tam.<ref>\"Or Zarua',\" ii., \u00a7 52</ref> Rabbeinu Tam's work is also cited by Rabbi Zerachya HaLevi, a [[Provence|Proven\u00e7al]] critic. He maintained a scholarly correspondence with [[Aaron ben Joseph of Beaugency]] and received questions from students throughout France and from the [[Italy|Italian]] communities of [[Bari]] and [[Otranto]].\n\nRabbeinu Tam gave his [[Beth Din]] the title of \"the generation's [most] significant court\", and indeed, he is known for communal enactments improving Jewish family life, education, and women's status. At times, he criticised Halakhic opponents, notably in his controversies with Meshullam of [[Melun]] and Efraim of [[Regensburg]].\n\n== Halakhic disputes ==\n\nLegend has it that when [[Rashi]] was holding his infant grandson, the baby touched the [[tefillin]] that were on Rashi's head. Rashi predicted that this grandson would later disagree with him about the order of the scripts that are put in the head [[tefillin]]. Regardless of the episode's veracity, Rabbeinu Tam did disagree with the opinion of his antecedent. Today, both \"Rashi tefillin\" and \"Rabbeinu Tam tefillin\" are produced: the ''[[Shulchan Aruch]]'' requires wearing Rashi's version and recommends that God-fearing Jews wear both in order to satisfy both halakhic opinions. However:<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.tzemachdovid.org/thepracticaltorah/bo.shtml|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070713184523/http://www.tzemachdovid.org/thepracticaltorah/bo.shtml|url-status=dead|title=Parshas Bo: Rabbeinu Tam Tefillin|archive-date=July 13, 2007|website=www.tzemachdovid.org}}</ref> {{quote|\"It is worth noting that the Shulchan Aruch ... rules that Rabbeinu Tam Tefillin should be worn only by one who is known to be a very pious person; the [[Mishnah Berurah]] ... explains that it is a sign of haughtiness for anyone else to do this because the accepted practice is to wear Rashi Tefillin.\"}}\n\nHowever, many [[Sephardi Jews|Sephardic]] and [[chasidism|chasidic]] Jews<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.stam.net/what_is_stam.aspx |title=Torah scrolls, Sefer Torah projects, tefillin, mezuzah scrolls & Megillah scrolls from Israel |publisher=Stam.net |access-date=2013-04-05}}</ref> wear Rabbeinu Tam's Tefillin (in addition to wearing Rashi's) per opinions presented in the ''Shulchan Aruch'' and its extensive commentaries authored throughout the early-modern and modern era. The rise and articulation of chasidic philosophy has conflated the kabbalistic and halakhic aspects of Rabbeinu Tam's position, popularizing the custom to wear both pairs every day. Wearing Rabbeinu Tam tefillin is an almost universal custom among the many and diverse communities that follow the teachings of the [[Baal Shem Tov]] and his students.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.biu.ac.il/JH/Parasha/ekev/eli.html|title=\u05e9\u05e0\u05d9 \u05d6\u05d5\u05d2\u05d5\u05ea \u05ea\u05e4\u05d9\u05dc\u05d9\u05df|website=www.biu.ac.il|author=\u05de\u05e0\u05e9\u05d4 \u05d0\u05dc\u05d9\u05e9\u05d9\u05d1|language=he}}</ref>\n\nAnother halakhic disagreement between Rabbeinu Tam and Rashi concerns the placement of the [[mezuzah]]. Rashi rules that it should be mounted on the doorpost in a vertical position; Rabbeinu Tam holds that it should be mounted horizontally. In a compromise solution, many [[Ashkenazi]] Jews place the mezuzah on the door in a slanted position.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.faqs.org/faqs/judaism/FAQ/03-Torah-Halacha/section-61.html |title=soc.culture.jewish FAQ: Torah and Halachic Authority (3/12)Section \u2013 Question 4.12: Who was Rabbeinu Tam? |publisher=Faqs.org |date=2012-08-08 |access-date=2013-04-05}}</ref> Sephardi Jews mount the mezuzah vertically, per the opinions of Rashi, [[Maimonides]], and the ''Shulchan Aruch''.\n\n== Liturgical poet ==\n\nIn the field of Hebrew poetry the importance of R. Tam is not slight. He was influenced by the poetry of the Spaniards, and is the chief representative of the transition period, in Christian lands, from the old \"payye\u1e6danic\" mode of expression to the more graceful forms of the Spanish school. According to Zunz,<ref>Zunz, ''Literaturgesch.'' pp.&nbsp;265 et seq.</ref> he composed the following pieces for the synagogue: (1) several poems for the evening prayer of [[Sukkot]] and of [[Shemini Atzeret]]; (2) a hymn for the close of Sabbath on which a wedding is celebrated; (3) a hymn for the replacing of the [[Torah]] rolls in the Ark on [[Simchat Torah]]; (4) an \"ofan\" in four metric strophes;<ref>see Luzzatto in ''Kerem \u1e24emed'', vii.35</ref> (5) four [[Aramaic]] ''reshut''; (6) two ''selichot'' (the second is reproduced by Zunz in ''S.P.'' p.&nbsp;248, in German verse).<ref>see also \"Nachalat SHeDaL\" in Berliner's ''Magazin'' [\"O\u1e93ar \u1e6cob\"], 1880, p.&nbsp;36.</ref> It must, however, be remarked that there was a synagogal poet by the name of Jacob ben Me\u00efr (Levi) who might easily have been confounded with the subject of this article, and therefore Tam's authorship of all of these poems is not above doubt.<ref>See [[Landshuth]], \"'Ammude ha-'Abodah\", p.&nbsp;106; comp. also Harkavy, \"\u1e24adashim gam Yeshanim\", supplement to the Hebrew edition of Graetz, \"Hist.\" v. 39; Brody, \"\u1e32un\u1e6dras ha-Piyyu\u1e6dim\", p.&nbsp;72</ref>\n\nThe short poems which sometimes precede his ''[[responsa]]'' also show great poetic talent and a pure Hebrew style (see Bacher in ''Monatsschrift'', xliv.56 et seq.). When [[Abraham ibn Ezra]] was traveling through France R. Tam greeted him in verse, whereupon Ibn Ezra exclaimed in astonishment: \"Who has admitted the French into the temple of poetry?\" (''Kerem \u1e24emed'', vii.35). Another work of his in metric form is his poem on the accents, which contains forty-five strophes riming in; it is found in various libraries (Padua, Hamburg, Parma), and is entitled ''Ma\u1e25beret.'' Luzzatto has given the first four strophes in ''Kerem \u1e24emed'' (vii.38), and Halberstam has printed the whole poem in Kobak's \"Jeschurun\" (v.123).\n\n== Gravesite ==\n\nRabbeinu Tam and his brothers, the Rashbam and the Rivam, as well as other Tosafists, were buried in Ramerupt. The unmarked, ancient cemetery in which they are buried lies adjacent to a street called Street of the Great Cemetery. In 2005, Rabbi [[Yisroel Meir Gabbai]], a [[Breslov (Hasidic dynasty)|Breslover]] [[Hasidic Judaism|Hasid]] who renovates and repairs neglected gravesites of Jewish leaders around the world, helped to determine the exact boundaries of the cemetery. In addition, a member of the Jewish religious community in [[Paris]] bought a house at the site and converted it into a [[beth midrash]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://chareidi.shemayisrael.com/archives5764/VYC64features.htm |title=A Man with a Grave Mission \u2013 Part I |last=Friedman |first=Yisroel |date=7 January 2004 |access-date=28 December 2010 |publisher=Dei'ah VeDibur |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091230162815/http://chareidi.shemayisrael.com/archives5764/VYC64features.htm |archive-date=30 December 2009}}</ref>\n\n== Works ==\n\nRabbeinu Tam's best known work is ''Sefer HaYashar'', which contained both ''[[novellae]]'' and ''responsa'', its main purpose to resolve Talmudic textual problems without resorting to emendations of the received text. Even the best editions show considerable corruption of the original work, and all present editions of ''Sefer HaYashar'' are fragments collected from it.

It may be as thin as see-through bangs or as thick as blunt bangs. Mostly trimmed using a point cutting technique, in which hair is cut using the tip of the shears rather than its blade to achieve a more feathered or uneven or natural look.\n*'''Blunt bangs''': The hair is cut straight across the forehead in a blunt manner.

Usually, it acts as a versatile, less commitment fringe style and is considered by some to suit all types of faces. It can be worn as a full fringe or as a side swept fringe. Commonly, it is done by the point cutting technique, in which the shears are held vertically or slightly at an angle rather than a horizontally blunt cut. Unlike the typical straight across or full bangs, see-through can easily be concealed by its thinness without the trimmed portion even being noticed. Unlike the straight-across or side-swept styles, which each have their respective lengths, see-through can be of eyebrow length or even as long as side-swept or peekaboo bangs, where the hair can reach eye level. Unlike typical bangs that require high maintenance, such as brushing while being heavily blow-dried, ironing, and/or styling, see-through bangs need just a simple light combing with a narrow-toothed comb after a shower and light blow-drying.\n*'''Angled or asymmetrical bangs''': The bangs are cut into layers at an angle, such that there are different lengths of hair overlapping each other.

The style is similar to full bangs but the bangs are longer as they approach the two sides of the forehead.

The hair towards the hairline is usually longer than the hair above, creating a [[feathered hair|feathered]] effect.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-MByu22Uvbj0/UgpqGBTOGjI/AAAAAAAADxM/AWuLMrekzGE/s1600/Tiffany.jpg |title=Photo |publisher=2.bp.blogspot.com |date= |accessdate=2019-11-13}}</ref>  It can also be cut into a side-swept style and brushed back to enhance the effect.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://i.pinimg.com/736x/68/7c/25/687c2515beafd6acea93c2369602aca1--hairstyles-for-round-faces-curly-hairstyles.jpg |title=Photo |publisher=i.pinimg.com |date= |accessdate=2019-11-13}}</ref>\n*'''Arch or rounded bangs''': A more rounded type of cut, in which the bangs form the shape on an arch, similar to a crescent moon shape pointing upward. The style is similar to full bangs but the bangs are longer as they approach the two sides of the forehead. Usually, it is achieved by twisting the hair on the fringe area using one's dominant hand and substituting it with the non-dominant hand to form a cross hair and underneath the fingers is the amount of hair that must be cut off.<ref>{{cite web|author=Sam Villa |url=http://www.samvilla.com/pro/blog/2013/02/perfecting-the-fringe-twist-cut-front-and-side-sweeping-fringes/ |title=Cutting The Perfect Fringe Using The Twist Bang Cut Technique |publisher=Sam Villa |date=2016-02-05 |accessdate=2016-09-04}}</ref> Usually, this style is thicker and looks heavier than straight-across bangs.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://dy6g3i6a1660s.cloudfront.net/Cl2tPU2OaTDZuNtL_mjHTAEsATs/orig.jpg |format=JPG |title=Photographic image |website=Dy6g3i6a1660s.cloudfront.net |accessdate=2016-09-10}}</ref>\n*'''Curtain bangs''': The hair is parted down the middle or slightly off center. It is rather similar to side-swept in terms of length and to see-through in terms of styling and thickness. It flows outwards the sides of the face and is commonly longer as it goes on the sides. Similar to arch/rounded fringe in structure yet longer in terms of length.\n*'''Baby or statement short bangs''': The hair is usually cut above the brows, normally bluntly across the middle of the forehead, but may be shorter. It usually complements a child's short haircut or a [[bob cut]].{{cn|date=November 2019}}\n*'''Brow-skimming or Textured bangs''': A style that falls below the brow and can look \"heavy\" or \"light\" on the face which is more of the uneven, choppy looking fringe to make a peek-a-boo effect on the forehead.<ref name=\"teamsugar\">{{cite web|url=http://images.teamsugar.com/files/upl2/0/3987/09_2009/b4040ff9e1c6f05d_Lauren-Conrad.preview.jpg|title=Image: b4040ff9e1c6f05d_Lauren-Conrad.preview.jpg, (550 \u00d7 425 px)|publisher=images.teamsugar.com|accessdate=5 September 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://encrypted-tbn2.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:ANd9GcTiWm2MjrSNCH0vy3OZ63Ld7HZXK_s4TfilyJFKk1Uu2F_A15nj |title=Photographic image |website=Encrypted-tbn2.gstatic.com |accessdate=2016-09-10}}</ref>\n\n==History and development==\nBangs occur naturally in many styles of short hair-cuts.\n\nHairstyles that feature bangs have come and gone out of fashion as frequently as other hairstyles, and they can be worn in any number of ways. Influential people with bangs in modern times have included silent movie actress [[Louise Brooks]], 1950s glamor model [[Bettie Page]], [[the Beatles]], and actress [[Elizabeth Taylor]] in the role of [[Cleopatra (1963 film)|Cleopatra]].\n\nIn the 1970s, English actress and singer [[Jane Birkin]] helped establish the iconic look of brow-length bangs combined with overall long hair.{{citation needed|date=September 2013}}\n\nIn the 1980s and early 1990s, curly, teased bangs were in fashion, often held high in place with copious amounts of [[hair spray]].\n\nIn 2007, bangs saw another massive revival as a hair trend, this time thick, deep and blunt-cut. In October 2007, style icon and model [[Kate Moss]] changed her hairstyle to have bangs, signalling the continuation of the trend into 2008.<ref name=\"fashionising\">{{cite web|url=http://www.fashionising.com/trends/b--Kate-Moss-gets-a-new-hairstyle-with-fringe-807.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071029091825/http://www.fashionising.com/trends/b--Kate-Moss-gets-a-new-hairstyle-with-fringe-807.html |archive-date=29 October 2007 |url-status=dead |title=Kate Moss gets a new hairstyle, with fringe - Fashionising.com |accessdate=5 September 2015 }}</ref>\n\n==See also==\n*[[Bowl cut]]\n*[[Mop top|Mop top haircut]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* {{Commons category-inline}}\n* {{Wiktionary-inline}}\n\n{{Human hair}}\n\n[[Category:20th-century fashion]]\n[[Category:21st-century fashion]]\n[[Category:Hairstyles]]\n", "name_user": "2a02:1812:c6b:5200:894d:be8a:a80b:6d35", "label": "unsafe", "comment": "", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bangs_(hair)"}
