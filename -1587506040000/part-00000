Instituted in 2 January 1954, the award is conferred \"in recognition of exceptional service/performance of the highest order\", without distinction of race, occupation, position, or sex.<ref name=\"award1\"/><ref name=\"award2\"/><ref name=\"scheme\"/> The award was originally limited to achievements in the arts, literature, science, and public services, but the [[Government of India|government]] expanded the criteria to include \"any field of human endeavour\" in December 2011.<ref name=\"sports\"/> The recommendations for the Bharat Ratna are made by the [[Prime Minister of India|Prime Minister]] to the [[President of India|President]], with a maximum of three nominees being awarded per year. Recipients receive a ''Sanad'' (certificate) signed by the President and a [[peepal]]-leaf\u2013shaped medallion; there is no monetary grant associated with the award. Bharat Ratna recipients rank seventh in the [[Indian order of precedence]].\n\nThe first recipients of the Bharat Ratna were politician [[C. Rajagopalachari]], philosopher [[Sarvepalli Radhakrishnan]], and scientist [[C. V. Raman]], who was honoured in 1954. Since then, the award has been bestowed upon 48 individuals, including 16 who were awarded posthumously. The original statutes did not provide for posthumous awards but were amended in January 1955 to permit them. Former Prime Minister [[Lal Bahadur Shastri]] became the first individual to be honoured posthumously. In 2014, cricketer [[Sachin Tendulkar]], then aged 40, became the youngest recipient; while social reformer [[Dhondo Keshav Karve]] was awarded on his 100th birthday. The first singer to be awarded Bharat Ratna was Smt. [[M. S. Subbulakshmi]]. Though usually conferred on India-born citizens, the Bharat Ratna has been awarded to one naturalised citizen, [[Mother Teresa]], and to two non-Indians, Pakistan national [[Khan Abdul Ghaffar Khan]] and former [[President of South Africa|South African President]] [[Nelson Mandela]]. On 25 January 2019, the government announced the award to social activist [[Nanaji Deshmukh]] (posthumously), singer-music director [[Bhupen Hazarika]] (posthumously) and to former President of India [[Pranab Mukherjee]].\n\nThe Bharat Ratna, along with other personal [[Indian honours system#Civilian awards|civil honours]], was briefly suspended from July 1977 to January 1980, during the change in the national government; and for a second time from August 1992 to December 1995, when several [[public-interest litigation]]s challenged the constitutional validity of the awards. In 1992, the government's decision to confer the award posthumously on [[Subhas Chandra Bose]] was opposed by those who had refused to accept the fact of his [[Death of Subhas Chandra Bose|death]], including some members of his extended family. Following a 1997 [[Supreme Court of India|Supreme Court]] decision, the press communiqu\u00e9 announcing Bose's award was cancelled; it is the only time when the award was announced but not conferred.\n\nSeveral bestowals of the award have met with criticism. The posthumous award for [[M. G. Ramachandran]] (1988) was considered to have been aimed at placating the voters for the upcoming assembly election and posthumous awards of [[Madan Mohan Malaviya]] (2015) and [[Vallabhbhai Patel]] (1991) drew criticism for they died before the award was instituted.\n\n==History==\nOn 2 January 1954, a press communiqu\u00e9 was released from the office of the secretary to the President announcing the creation of two civilian awards\u2014Bharat Ratna, the highest civilian award, and the three-tier [[Padma Vibhushan]], classified into \"Pahela Warg\" (Class I), \"Dusra Warg\" (Class II), and \"Tisra Warg\" (Class III), which rank below the Bharat Ratna.<ref name=\"award1\">{{cite journal|url=http://www.egazette.nic.in/WriteReadData/1954/E-2233-1954-0001-103507.pdf|title=The Gazette of India\u2014Extraordinary\u2014Part I|last=Lal|first=Shavax A.|year=1954|journal=The Gazette of India|publisher=The President's Secretariat|publication-date=2 January 1954|accessdate=12 May 2014|format=PDF|pages=2|quote=The President is pleased to institute an award to be designated Bharat Ratna and to make the following Regulations|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140514155953/http://www.egazette.nic.in/WriteReadData/1954/E-2233-1954-0001-103507.pdf|archivedate=14 May 2014}}</ref> On 15 January 1955, the Padma Vibhushan was reclassified into three different awards; the Padma Vibhushan, the highest of the three, followed by the [[Padma Bhushan]] and the [[Padma Shri]].<ref name=\"award2\">{{cite journal|url=http://www.egazette.nic.in/WriteReadData/1955/O-2196-1955-0003-100533.pdf|title=The Gazette of India\u2014Extraordinary\u2014Part I|last=Ayyar|first=N.

Instituted in 2 January 1954, the award is conferred \"in recognition of exceptional service/performance of the highest order\", without distinction of race, occupation, position, or sex.<ref name=\"award1\"/><ref name=\"award2\"/><ref name=\"scheme\"/> The award was originally limited to achievements in the arts, literature, science, and public services, but the [[Government of India|government]] expanded the criteria to include \"any field of human endeavour\" in December 2011.<ref name=\"sports\"/> The recommendations for the Bharat Ratna are made by the [[Prime Minister of India|Prime Minister]] to the [[President of India|President]], with a maximum of three nominees being awarded per year. Recipients receive a ''Sanad'' (certificate) signed by the President and a [[peepal]]-leaf\u2013shaped medallion; there is no monetary grant associated with the award. Bharat Ratna recipients rank seventh in the [[Indian order of precedence]].\n\nThe first recipients of the Bharat Ratna were politician [[C. Rajagopalachari]], philosopher [[Sarvepalli Radhakrishnan]], and scientist [[C. V. Raman]], who was honoured in 1954. Since then, the award has been bestowed upon 48 individuals, including 16 who were awarded posthumously. The original statutes did not provide for posthumous awards but were amended in January 1955 to permit them. Former Prime Minister [[Lal Bahadur Shastri]] became the first individual to be honoured posthumously. In 2014, cricketer [[Sachin Tendulkar]], then aged 40, became the youngest recipient; while social reformer [[Dhondo Keshav Karve]] was awarded on his 100th birthday. The first singer to be awarded Bharat Ratna was Smt. [[M. S. Subbulakshmi]]. Though usually conferred on India-born citizens, the Bharat Ratna has been awarded to one naturalised citizen, [[Mother Teresa]], and to two non-Indians, Pakistan national [[Khan Abdul Ghaffar Khan]] and former [[President of South Africa|South African President]] [[Nelson Mandela]]. On 25 January 2019, the government announced the award to social activist [[Nanaji Deshmukh]] (posthumously), singer-music director [[Bhupen Hazarika]] (posthumously) and to former President of India [[Pranab Mukherjee]].\n\nThe Bharat Ratna, along with other personal [[Indian honours system#Civilian awards|civil honours]], was briefly suspended from July 1977 to January 1980, during the change in the national government; and for a second time from August 1992 to December 1995, when several [[public-interest litigation]]s challenged the constitutional validity of the awards. In 1992, the government's decision to confer the award posthumously on [[Subhas Chandra Bose]] was opposed by those who had refused to accept the fact of his [[Death of Subhas Chandra Bose|death]], including some members of his extended family. Following a 1997 [[Supreme Court of India|Supreme Court]] decision, the press communiqu\u00e9 announcing Bose's award was cancelled; it is the only time when the award was announced but not conferred.\n\nSeveral bestowals of the award have met with criticism. The posthumous award for [[M. G. Ramachandran]] (1988) was considered to have been aimed at placating the voters for the upcoming assembly election and posthumous awards of [[Madan Mohan Malaviya]] (2015) and [[Vallabhbhai Patel]] (1991) drew criticism for they died before the award was instituted.\n\n==History==\nOn 2 January 1954, a press communiqu\u00e9 was released from the office of the secretary to the President announcing the creation of two civilian awards\u2014Bharat Ratna, the highest civilian award, and the three-tier [[Padma Vibhushan]], classified into \"Pahela Warg\" (Class I), \"Dusra Warg\" (Class II), and \"Tisra Warg\" (Class III), which rank below the Bharat Ratna.<ref name=\"award1\">{{cite journal|url=http://www.egazette.nic.in/WriteReadData/1954/E-2233-1954-0001-103507.pdf|title=The Gazette of India\u2014Extraordinary\u2014Part I|last=Lal|first=Shavax A.|year=1954|journal=The Gazette of India|publisher=The President's Secretariat|publication-date=2 January 1954|accessdate=12 May 2014|format=PDF|pages=2|quote=The President is pleased to institute an award to be designated Bharat Ratna and to make the following Regulations|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140514155953/http://www.egazette.nic.in/WriteReadData/1954/E-2233-1954-0001-103507.pdf|archivedate=14 May 2014}}</ref> On 15 January 1955, the Padma Vibhushan was reclassified into three different awards; the Padma Vibhushan, the highest of the three, followed by the [[Padma Bhushan]] and the [[Padma Shri]].<ref name=\"award2\">{{cite journal|url=http://www.egazette.nic.in/WriteReadData/1955/O-2196-1955-0003-100533.pdf|title=The Gazette of India\u2014Extraordinary\u2014Part I|last=Ayyar|first=N.
