Of the others, [[Kos]] and [[Patmos]] are historically the more important; the remaining twelve are [[Agathonisi]], [[Astypalaia]], [[Halki (Greece)|Chalki]], [[Kalymnos]], [[Karpathos]], [[Kasos]], [[Leipsoi]], [[Leros]], [[Nisyros]], [[Symi]], [[Tilos]], and [[Kastellorizo]]. Other islands in the chain include  [[Alimia]], [[Arkoi]], [[Chalki]], [[Farmakonisi]], [[Gyali]], [[Kinaros]], [[Lebynthos|Levitha]], [[Marathos Island|Marathos]], [[Nimos]], [[Pserimos]], [[Saria Island|Saria]], [[Strongyli Megistis|Strongyli]], [[Syrna (island)|Syrna]] and [[Telendos]].\n\n==Name==\nThe name \"Dodecanese\" (older form \u1f21 \u0394\u03c9\u03b4\u03b5\u03ba\u03ac\u03bd\u03b7\u03c3\u03bf\u03c2, ''h\u0113 D\u014ddekan\u0113sos''; modern \u03c4\u03b1 \u0394\u03c9\u03b4\u03b5\u03ba\u03ac\u03bd\u03b7\u03c3\u03b1, ''ta D\u014ddekan\u0113sa''), meaning \"The Twelve Islands\", denotes today an island group in the southeastern [[Aegean Sea]], comprising fifteen major islands ([[Agathonisi]], [[Astypalaia]], [[Chalki]], [[Kalymnos]], [[Karpathos]], [[Kasos]], [[Kastellorizo]], [[Kos]], [[Lipsi]], [[Leros]], [[Nisyros]], [[Patmos]], [[Rhodes]], [[Symi]], and [[Tilos]]) and 93 smaller islets.{{sfn|Giannopoulos|2006|pp=275\u2013276}} Since Antiquity, these islands formed part of the group known as the \"[[Southern Sporades]]\" (\u039d\u03cc\u03c4\u03b9\u03b5\u03c2 \u03a3\u03c0\u03bf\u03c1\u03ac\u03b4\u03b5\u03c2).{{sfn|Giannopoulos|2006|p=275}}\n\nThe name ''D\u014ddekan\u0113sos'' first appears in [[Byzantine]] sources in the 8th century, as a naval command under a ''[[droungarios]]'', encompassing the southern Aegean Sea, which eventually evolved into the [[Theme of Samos]].{{sfn|Ahrweiler|1966|pp=79\u201381}} However it was not applied to the current island group, but to the twelve [[Cyclades]] islands clustered around [[Delos]]. The name may indeed be of far earlier date, and modern historians suggest that the 12 islands mentioned by [[Strabo]] (''[[Geographica]]'' \u03a7.485)<ref>Strabo, ''[[Geographica]]'', [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Strabo/10E*.html X, 485]: \"Now at first the Cyclades are said to have been only twelve in number, but later several others were added\".</ref> was the origin of the term. The term remained in use throughout the medieval period and was still used for the Cyclades in both colloquial usage and scholarly Greek-language literature until the 18th century.{{sfn|Giannopoulos|2006|pp=276\u2013278}}\n\nThe transfer of the name to the present-day Dodecanese has its roots in the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] period. Following the [[Siege of Rhodes (1522)|Ottoman conquest]] in 1522, the two larger islands, Rhodes and Kos, came under [[Sanjak of Rhodes|direct Ottoman rule]], while the others, of which the twelve main islands were usually named, enjoyed extensive privileges pertaining to taxation and self-government. Concerted attempts to abolish these privileges were made after 1869, as the Ottoman Empire attempted to modernize and centralize its administrative structure, and the last vestiges of the old privileges were finally abolished after the [[Young Turks]] [[Young Turk Revolution|took power]]  in 1908.{{sfn|Giannopoulos|2006|pp=278\u2013280}} It was at that time that the press in the independent [[Kingdom of Greece (Gl\u00fccksburg)|Kingdom of Greece]] began referring to the twelve privileged islands (Astypalaia, Chalki, [[Ikaria]], Kalymnos, Karpathos, Kasos, Kastellorizo, Leros, Nisyros, Patmos, Symi, Tilos), in the context of their attempts to preserve their privileges, collectively as the \"Dodecanese\". Shortly after, in 1912, most of the Southern Sporades were captured by the Italians in the [[Italo-Turkish War]], except for Ikaria, which joined Greece in 1912 during the [[First Balkan War]], and Kastellorizo, which came under Italian rule only in 1921. The place of the latter two was taken by Kos and Rhodes, bringing the number of the major islands under Italian rule back to twelve. Thus, when the Greek press began agitating for the cession of the islands to Greece in 1913, the term used was still the \"Dodecanese\". The Italian occupation authorities helped to establish the term when they named the islands under their control \"[[Rhodes and the Dodecanese]]\" (''Rodi e Dodecaneso''), adding [[Leipsoi]] to the list of the major islands to make up for considering Rhodes separately.{{sfn|Giannopoulos|2006|pp=280\u2013284}} \n\nBy 1920, the name had become firmly established for the entire island group, a fact acknowledged by the Italian government when it appointed the islands' first civilian governor, Count {{ill|Carlo Senni|it}}, as \"Viceroy of the Dodecanese\". As the name was associated with Greek irredentism, from 1924 [[Mussolini]]'s [[Fascist Italy (1922\u20131943)|Fascist regime]] tried to abolish its use by referring to them as the \"[[Italian Islands of the Aegean]]\", but this name never acquired any wider currency outside Italian administrative usage.{{sfn|Giannopoulos|2006|pp=284\u2013294}} The islands [[Treaty of Paris (1947)|joined Greece]] in 1947 following as the \"Governorate-General of the Dodecanese\" (\u0393\u03b5\u03bd\u03b9\u03ba\u03ae \u0394\u03b9\u03bf\u03af\u03ba\u03b7\u03c3\u03b9\u03c2 \u0394\u03c9\u03b4\u03b5\u03ba\u03b1\u03bd\u03ae\u03c3\u03bf\u03c5), since 1955 the \"Dodecanese Prefecture\" (\u039d\u03bf\u03bc\u03cc\u03c2 \u0394\u03c9\u03b4\u03b5\u03ba\u03b1\u03bd\u03ae\u03c3\u03bf\u03c5).{{sfn|Giannopoulos|2006|p=294}}\n\n==History==\n\n===Pre-history and the Archaic period===\n[[File:Colosse de Rhodes (Barclay).jpg|thumb|left|180px|[[Colossus of Rhodes]], one of the [[Seven Wonders of the Ancient World]]]]\n[[File:Doric Temple of Athena Lindia.jpg|thumb|The Doric temple of Athena Lindia, [[Lindos]]]]\nThe Dodecanese have been inhabited since prehistoric times. In the [[Minoan civilization#History|Neopalatial period]] on Crete, the islands were heavily [[Minoan civilization#Minoans beyond Crete|Minoanized]] (contact beginning in the second millennium BC). Following the downfall of the Minoans, the islands were ruled by the [[Mycenaean Greeks]] from circa 1400 BC, until the arrival of the [[Dorians]] circa 1100 BC. It is in the Dorian period that they began to prosper as an independent entity, developing a thriving economy and culture through the following centuries. By the early [[Archaic period in Greece|Archaic period]] Rhodes and Kos emerged as the major islands in the group, and in the 6th century BC the Dorians founded three major cities on Rhodes ([[Lindos]], [[Kameiros]] and [[Ialyssos]]). Together with the island of Kos and the cities of [[Knidos]] and [[Halicarnassos]] on the mainland of [[Asia Minor]], these made up the [[Dorian Hexapolis]].\n\n===Classical period===\n\nThis development was interrupted around 499 BC by the [[Persian Wars]], during which the islands were captured by the Persians for a brief period. Following the defeat of the Persians by the [[Classical Athens|Athenians]] in 478 BC, the cities joined the Athenian-dominated [[Delian League]]. When the [[Peloponnesian War]] broke out in 431 BC, they remained largely neutral although they were still members of the League.\n\nBy the time the Peloponnesian War ended in 404 BC, the Dodecanese were mostly removed from the larger Aegean conflicts, and had begun a period of relative quiet and prosperity. In 408 BC, the three cities of Rhodes had united to form one state, which built a new capital on the northern end of the island, also named ''Rhodes''; this united Rhodes was to dominate the region for the coming millennia. Other islands in the Dodecanese also developed into significant economic and cultural centers; most notably, Kos served as the site of the school of [[medicine]] founded by [[Hippocrates]].\n\nHowever, the Peloponnesian War had so weakened the entire Greek civilization's military strength that it lay open to invasion. In 357 BC, the islands were conquered by the king [[Mausolus]] of [[Caria]], then in 340 BC by the Persians. But this second period of Persian rule proved to be nearly as short as the first, and the islands became part of the rapidly growing [[Macedon|Macedonian Empire]] as [[Alexander the Great]] swept through and defeated the Persians in 332 BC, to the great relief of the islands' inhabitants.\n\nFollowing the death of Alexander, the islands, and even Rhodes itself, were split up among the [[Diadochi|many generals]] who [[Wars of the Diadochi|contended to succeed him]]. The islands formed strong commercial ties with the [[Ptolemies]] in [[Egypt]], and together they formed the [[Rhodo-Egyptian alliance]] which controlled trade throughout the Aegean in the 3rd century BC. Led by Rhodes, the islands developed into maritime, commercial and cultural centers: coins of Rhodes circulated almost everywhere in the Mediterranean, and the islands' schools of philosophy, literature and rhetoric were famous. The [[Colossus of Rhodes]], built in 304 BC, perhaps best symbolized their wealth and power.\n\nIn 164 BC, Rhodes signed a treaty with [[Ancient Rome|Rome]], and the islands became aligned to greater or lesser extent with the [[Roman Republic]] while mostly maintaining their autonomy. Rhodes quickly became a major schooling center for Roman noble families, and, as the islands (and particularly Rhodes) were important allies of Rome, they enjoyed numerous privileges and generally friendly relations. These were eventually lost in 42 BC, in the [[Liberators' civil war|turmoil]] following the assassination of [[Julius Caesar]] in 44 BC, after which [[Gaius Cassius Longinus|Cassius]] invaded and sacked the islands. Thereafter, they became part of the Roman Empire proper. [[Titus]] made Rhodes capital of the ''[[Provincia Insularum]]'', and eventually the islands were joined with [[Crete]] as part of the 18th Province of the Roman Empire.\n\nIn the 1st century, [[Paul of Tarsus|Saint Paul]] visited the islands twice, and [[John the Apostle|Saint John]] visited numerous times; they succeeded in converting the islands to Christianity, placing them among the first dominantly Christian regions. Saint John eventually came to reside among them, being exiled to Patmos, where he wrote his famous ''Revelation''.\n\n===Middle Ages===\n{{Main article|Cibyrrhaeot Theme|Knights Hospitaller}}\n[[File:Chora di Patmos con il Monastero di San Giovanni \"il teologo\".JPG|thumb|[[Monastery of Saint John the Theologian]], [[Patmos]]]]\n[[File:Rhodes old town Greece 6.jpg|thumb|[[Palace of the Grand Master of the Knights of Rhodes]]]]\n\nAs the Roman Empire split in AD 395 into Eastern and Western halves, the islands became part of the Eastern part, which later evolved into the [[Byzantine Empire]]. They would remain there for nearly a thousand years, though these were punctuated by numerous invasions. It was during this period that they began to re-emerge as an independent entity, and the term ''Dodecanese'' itself dates to around the 8th century. Copious evidence of the Byzantine period remains on the islands today, most notably in hundreds of churches from the period which can be seen in various states of preservation.\n\nIn the 13th century, with the [[Fourth Crusade]], Italians began invading portions of the Dodecanese, which had remained under the nominal power of the [[Empire of Nicea]]; [[Venice|Venetians]] (Querini, [[Cornaro]]) and [[Genoa|Genoese]] families ([[Vignoli]]) each held some islands for brief periods, while Orthodox monks ruled on Patmos and Leros. Finally, in the 14th century, the Byzantine era came to an end when the islands were taken by forces of the [[Knights Hospitaller]] (Knights of St John): [[Hospitaller conquest of Rhodes|Rhodes was conquered]] in 1309, and the rest of the islands fell gradually over the next few decades. The Knights made Rhodes their stronghold, transforming its capital into a grandiose medieval city dominated by an impressive fortress, and scattered fortresses and citadels through the rest of the islands as well.\n\nThese massive fortifications proved sufficient to repel invasions by the Sultan of Egypt in 1444 and [[Mehmed II]] in [[Siege of Rhodes (1480)|1480]]. Finally, however, the citadel at Rhodes fell to the large army of [[Suleiman the Magnificent]] in [[Siege of Rhodes (1522)|1522]], and the other islands were overrun within the year. The few remaining Knights fled to [[Malta]].\n\n===Ottoman rule===\n{{Main article|Ottoman Greece}}\n[[File:The Mosque of Suleiman (view from below). Rhodes cityscape, the island of Rhodes, the Dodecanese, Greece.jpg|thumb|Suleiman mosque (view from below), [[Rhodes (city)]]]]\n\nThus began a period of several hundred years in the [[Ottoman Empire]]. The Dodecanese formed a [[Sanjak of Rhodes|separate province]] within the [[Eyalet of the Archipelago]]. The population was allowed to retain a number of privileges provided it submitted to Ottoman rule. By Suleiman's edict, they paid a special tax in return for a special autonomous status that prohibited Ottoman generals from interfering in their civil affairs or mistreating the population. These guarantees, combined with a strategic location at the crossroads of Mediterranean shipping, allowed the islands to prosper. The overwhelmingly Greek population (only Rhodes and Kos had Turkish communities) leaned heavily towards Greece following its declaration of independence in 1822, and many of the islanders joined the [[Greek War of Independence]], with the result that the northern portion of the Dodecanese (including [[Samos]]) became briefly the Greek provinces of the [[Eastern Sporades]] and [[Southern Sporades]]. [[Kasos]] in particular played  a prominent role due to its skilled mariners, until its [[Kasos massacre|destruction]] by the Egyptians in 1824. Most of the islands were slated to become part of the new Greek state in the [[London Protocol of 1828]], but when Greek independence was recognized in the [[London Protocol of 1830]], the islands were left outside the new [[Kingdom of Greece (Gl\u00fccksburg)|Kingdom of Greece]]. Indeed, the 19th century turned out to be one of the islands' most prosperous, and a number of mansions date from this era.\n\n====Turks of the Dodecanese====\n{{Main article|Turks of the Dodecanese}}\nThere is a [[Turkish people|Turkish]] Muslim minority living in [[Rhodes]] and [[Kos]].

The occupation continued after Italy declared war on the Ottoman Empire (21 August 1915) during the First World War.\n\nDuring the war, the islands became an important [[naval base]] for Britain and France; Italy was allied with both nations during [[World War I]]. The Dodecanese were used as a [[staging area]] for numerous campaigns, most famously the one at [[Gallipoli Campaign|Gallipoli]]. Some of the smaller islands were occupied by the French and British, but Rhodes remained under Italian occupation. In 1915, the French also occupied Kastellorizo.\n\nFollowing the war, the [[Tommaso Tittoni|Tittoni]]\u2013[[Eleftherios Venizelos|Venizelos]] agreement, signed on July 29, 1919, called for the smaller islands to join with Greece, while Italy maintained control of Rhodes. The treaty further outlined an exchange where Italy would receive [[Antalya]] for southwest [[Anatolia]]. The Greek defeat in the [[Greco-Turkish War (1919-1922)|Greco-Turkish War]] and the foundation of modern Turkey prevented the exchange. Italy formally annexed the Dodecanese as the ''[[Possedimenti Italiani dell'Egeo]]'' under the terms of the [[Treaty of Lausanne]]. Mussolini embarked on a program of [[Italianization]], hoping to make Rhodes a modern transportation hub that would serve as a focal point for the spread of Italian culture in the Levant. The islands were overwhelmingly [[Greek language|Greek-speaking]], with a [[Turkish language|Turkish-speaking]] minority and an even smaller [[Ladino language|Ladino]]-speaking [[Jew]]ish minority. Immigrant [[Italian language|Italian speakers]] were a marginal language community.\n\nThe Fascist program, in its many attempts to modernize the islands, eradicated [[malaria]], and constructed [[hospital]]s, [[aqueduct (watercourse)|aqueducts]], a [[power plant]] to provide Rhodes' capital with [[electric lighting]], and established the Dodecanese [[Cadastre]]. The main castle of the Knights of St. John was also rebuilt. The concrete-dominated Fascist architectural style detracted significantly from the islands' picturesque scenery (and also reminded the inhabitants of Italian rule), and has consequently been largely demolished or remodeled, apart from the famous example of the [[Leros]] town of [[Lakki, Leros|Lakki]], which remains a prime example of the architecture.\n\nFrom 1936 to 1940 [[Cesare Maria De Vecchi]] acted as Governor of the [[Italian Islands of the Aegean]] promoting the official use of the Italian language and favoring a process of [[italianization]], interrupted by the beginning of [[World War II]].<ref>{{cite book |url={{Google books |plainurl=yes |id=fJ3gVGqB1uQC |page=436 }} |title=The Dodecanese and the East Aegean ... |publisher= |date= |accessdate=2009-07-19 |page=436 | isbn=978-1-85828-883-3}}</ref> In the 1936 Italian census of the Dodecanese islands, the total population was 129,135, of which 7,015 were Italians.\n\n===World War II===\n{{main|Dodecanese campaign}}\n[[File:LerosWarCemetery2.JPG|thumb|WWII cemetery in [[Leros]]]]\n\nDuring World War II, Italy joined the [[Axis Powers]], which used the Dodecanese as a naval staging area for their [[invasion of Crete]] in 1941. After the [[Armistice with Italy|surrender of Italy]] in September 1943, the islands briefly became a battleground between the [[Nazi Germany|Germans]] and [[Allies of World War II|Allied]] forces, including the Italians. The Germans prevailed in the [[Dodecanese Campaign]], and although they were driven out of mainland Greece in 1944, the Dodecanese remained occupied until the end of the war in 1945, during which time nearly the entire Jewish population of 6,000 was [[Holocaust|deported and killed]]. Only 1,200 of these [[Judaeo-Spanish|Ladino]]-speaking Jews survived by escaping to the nearby coast of [[Turkey]]. On 8 May 1945 the German garrison commander [[Otto Wagener]] surrendered the islands to the British on Rhodes handing over 5,000 German and 600 Italian military personnel.<ref>{{cite web|last=Hearfield|first=John|title=German surrender of the Dodecanese islands|url=http://www.johnhearfield.com/Bob/Dodecanese/Occupation.htm|accessdate=23 April 2014}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Diaf\u00e1ni \u2013 Fountain of Neptune - 1.jpg|thumb|Modern fountain of Neptune in Diaf\u00e1ni, [[Karpathos]]]]\n[[File:Kalymnos port.JPG|thumb|[[Kalymnos]]]]\n\n===Post-World War II===\n[[File:Symi houses Greece.jpg|thumb|[[Symi]]]]\n[[File:Kastro.jpg|thumb|[[Leros]]]]\n[[File:IMFJ Astypalea 2006 1.jpg|thumb|[[Astypalaia]]]]\n\nFollowing the war, the islands became a British military protectorate, and were almost immediately allowed to run their own civil affairs, upon which the islands became informally united with Greece, though under separate sovereignty and military control.

The name may indeed be of far earlier date, and modern historians suggest that the 12 islands mentioned by [[Strabo]] (''[[Geographica]]'' \u03a7.485)<ref>Strabo, ''[[Geographica]]'', [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Strabo/10E*.html X, 485]: \"Now at first the Cyclades are said to have been only twelve in number, but later several others were added\".</ref> was the origin of the term. The term remained in use throughout the medieval period and was still used for the Cyclades in both colloquial usage and scholarly Greek-language literature until the 18th century.{{sfn|Giannopoulos|2006|pp=276\u2013278}}\n\nThe transfer of the name to the present-day Dodecanese has its roots in the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] period. Following the [[Siege of Rhodes (1522)|Ottoman conquest]] in 1522, the two larger islands, Rhodes and Kos, came under [[Sanjak of Rhodes|direct Ottoman rule]], while the others, of which the twelve main islands were usually named, enjoyed extensive privileges pertaining to taxation and self-government. Concerted attempts to abolish these privileges were made after 1869, as the Ottoman Empire attempted to modernize and centralize its administrative structure, and the last vestiges of the old privileges were finally abolished after the [[Young Turks]] [[Young Turk Revolution|took power]]  in 1908.{{sfn|Giannopoulos|2006|pp=278\u2013280}} It was at that time that the press in the independent [[Kingdom of Greece (Gl\u00fccksburg)|Kingdom of Greece]] began referring to the twelve privileged islands (Astypalaia, Chalki, [[Ikaria]], Kalymnos, Karpathos, Kasos, Kastellorizo, Leros, Nisyros, Patmos, Symi, Tilos), in the context of their attempts to preserve their privileges, collectively as the \"Dodecanese\". Shortly after, in 1912, most of the Southern Sporades were captured by the Italians in the [[Italo-Turkish War]], except for Ikaria, which joined Greece in 1912 during the [[First Balkan War]], and Kastellorizo, which came under Italian rule only in 1921. The place of the latter two was taken by Kos and Rhodes, bringing the number of the major islands under Italian rule back to twelve. Thus, when the Greek press began agitating for the cession of the islands to Greece in 1913, the term used was still the \"Dodecanese\". The Italian occupation authorities helped to establish the term when they named the islands under their control \"[[Rhodes and the Dodecanese]]\" (''Rodi e Dodecaneso''), adding [[Leipsoi]] to the list of the major islands to make up for considering Rhodes separately.{{sfn|Giannopoulos|2006|pp=280\u2013284}} \n\nBy 1920, the name had become firmly established for the entire island group, a fact acknowledged by the Italian government when it appointed the islands' first civilian governor, Count {{ill|Carlo Senni|it}}, as \"Viceroy of the Dodecanese\". As the name was associated with Greek irredentism, from 1924 [[Mussolini]]'s [[Fascist Italy (1922\u20131943)|Fascist regime]] tried to abolish its use by referring to them as the \"[[Italian Islands of the Aegean]]\", but this name never acquired any wider currency outside Italian administrative usage.{{sfn|Giannopoulos|2006|pp=284\u2013294}} The islands [[Treaty of Paris (1947)|joined Greece]] in 1947 following as the \"Governorate-General of the Dodecanese\" (\u0393\u03b5\u03bd\u03b9\u03ba\u03ae \u0394\u03b9\u03bf\u03af\u03ba\u03b7\u03c3\u03b9\u03c2 \u0394\u03c9\u03b4\u03b5\u03ba\u03b1\u03bd\u03ae\u03c3\u03bf\u03c5), since 1955 the \"Dodecanese Prefecture\" (\u039d\u03bf\u03bc\u03cc\u03c2 \u0394\u03c9\u03b4\u03b5\u03ba\u03b1\u03bd\u03ae\u03c3\u03bf\u03c5).{{sfn|Giannopoulos|2006|p=294}}\n\n==History==\n\n===Pre-history and the Archaic period===\n[[File:Colosse de Rhodes (Barclay).jpg|thumb|left|180px|[[Colossus of Rhodes]], one of the [[Seven Wonders of the Ancient World]]]]\n[[File:Doric Temple of Athena Lindia.jpg|thumb|The Doric temple of Athena Lindia, [[Lindos]]]]\nThe Dodecanese have been inhabited since prehistoric times. In the [[Minoan civilization#History|Neopalatial period]] on Crete, the islands were heavily [[Minoan civilization#Minoans beyond Crete|Minoanized]] (contact beginning in the second millennium BC). Following the downfall of the Minoans, the islands were ruled by the [[Mycenaean Greeks]] from circa 1400 BC, until the arrival of the [[Dorians]] circa 1100 BC. It is in the Dorian period that they began to prosper as an independent entity, developing a thriving economy and culture through the following centuries. By the early [[Archaic period in Greece|Archaic period]] Rhodes and Kos emerged as the major islands in the group, and in the 6th century BC the Dorians founded three major cities on Rhodes ([[Lindos]], [[Kameiros]] and [[Ialyssos]]). Together with the island of Kos and the cities of [[Knidos]] and [[Halicarnassos]] on the mainland of [[Asia Minor]], these made up the [[Dorian Hexapolis]].\n\n===Classical period===\n\nThis development was interrupted around 499 BC by the [[Persian Wars]], during which the islands were captured by the Persians for a brief period. Following the defeat of the Persians by the [[Classical Athens|Athenians]] in 478 BC, the cities joined the Athenian-dominated [[Delian League]]. When the [[Peloponnesian War]] broke out in 431 BC, they remained largely neutral although they were still members of the League.\n\nBy the time the Peloponnesian War ended in 404 BC, the Dodecanese were mostly removed from the larger Aegean conflicts, and had begun a period of relative quiet and prosperity. In 408 BC, the three cities of Rhodes had united to form one state, which built a new capital on the northern end of the island, also named ''Rhodes''; this united Rhodes was to dominate the region for the coming millennia. Other islands in the Dodecanese also developed into significant economic and cultural centers; most notably, Kos served as the site of the school of [[medicine]] founded by [[Hippocrates]].\n\nHowever, the Peloponnesian War had so weakened the entire Greek civilization's military strength that it lay open to invasion. In 357 BC, the islands were conquered by the king [[Mausolus]] of [[Caria]], then in 340 BC by the Persians. But this second period of Persian rule proved to be nearly as short as the first, and the islands became part of the rapidly growing [[Macedon|Macedonian Empire]] as [[Alexander the Great]] swept through and defeated the Persians in 332 BC, to the great relief of the islands' inhabitants.\n\nFollowing the death of Alexander, the islands, and even Rhodes itself, were split up among the [[Diadochi|many generals]] who [[Wars of the Diadochi|contended to succeed him]]. The islands formed strong commercial ties with the [[Ptolemies]] in [[Egypt]], and together they formed the [[Rhodo-Egyptian alliance]] which controlled trade throughout the Aegean in the 3rd century BC. Led by Rhodes, the islands developed into maritime, commercial and cultural centers: coins of Rhodes circulated almost everywhere in the Mediterranean, and the islands' schools of philosophy, literature and rhetoric were famous. The [[Colossus of Rhodes]], built in 304 BC, perhaps best symbolized their wealth and power.\n\nIn 164 BC, Rhodes signed a treaty with [[Ancient Rome|Rome]], and the islands became aligned to greater or lesser extent with the [[Roman Republic]] while mostly maintaining their autonomy. Rhodes quickly became a major schooling center for Roman noble families, and, as the islands (and particularly Rhodes) were important allies of Rome, they enjoyed numerous privileges and generally friendly relations. These were eventually lost in 42 BC, in the [[Liberators' civil war|turmoil]] following the assassination of [[Julius Caesar]] in 44 BC, after which [[Gaius Cassius Longinus|Cassius]] invaded and sacked the islands. Thereafter, they became part of the Roman Empire proper. [[Titus]] made Rhodes capital of the ''[[Provincia Insularum]]'', and eventually the islands were joined with [[Crete]] as part of the 18th Province of the Roman Empire.\n\nIn the 1st century, [[Paul of Tarsus|Saint Paul]] visited the islands twice, and [[John the Apostle|Saint John]] visited numerous times; they succeeded in converting the islands to Christianity, placing them among the first dominantly Christian regions. Saint John eventually came to reside among them, being exiled to Patmos, where he wrote his famous ''Revelation''.\n\n===Middle Ages===\n{{Main article|Cibyrrhaeot Theme|Knights Hospitaller}}\n[[File:Chora di Patmos con il Monastero di San Giovanni \"il teologo\".JPG|thumb|[[Monastery of Saint John the Theologian]], [[Patmos]]]]\n[[File:Rhodes old town Greece 6.jpg|thumb|[[Palace of the Grand Master of the Knights of Rhodes]]]]\n\nAs the Roman Empire split in AD 395 into Eastern and Western halves, the islands became part of the Eastern part, which later evolved into the [[Byzantine Empire]]. They would remain there for nearly a thousand years, though these were punctuated by numerous invasions. It was during this period that they began to re-emerge as an independent entity, and the term ''Dodecanese'' itself dates to around the 8th century. Copious evidence of the Byzantine period remains on the islands today, most notably in hundreds of churches from the period which can be seen in various states of preservation.\n\nIn the 13th century, with the [[Fourth Crusade]], Italians began invading portions of the Dodecanese, which had remained under the nominal power of the [[Empire of Nicea]]; [[Venice|Venetians]] (Querini, [[Cornaro]]) and [[Genoa|Genoese]] families ([[Vignoli]]) each held some islands for brief periods, while Orthodox monks ruled on Patmos and Leros. Finally, in the 14th century, the Byzantine era came to an end when the islands were taken by forces of the [[Knights Hospitaller]] (Knights of St John): [[Hospitaller conquest of Rhodes|Rhodes was conquered]] in 1309, and the rest of the islands fell gradually over the next few decades. The Knights made Rhodes their stronghold, transforming its capital into a grandiose medieval city dominated by an impressive fortress, and scattered fortresses and citadels through the rest of the islands as well.\n\nThese massive fortifications proved sufficient to repel invasions by the Sultan of Egypt in 1444 and [[Mehmed II]] in [[Siege of Rhodes (1480)|1480]]. Finally, however, the citadel at Rhodes fell to the large army of [[Suleiman the Magnificent]] in [[Siege of Rhodes (1522)|1522]], and the other islands were overrun within the year. The few remaining Knights fled to [[Malta]].\n\n===Ottoman rule===\n{{Main article|Ottoman Greece}}\n[[File:The Mosque of Suleiman (view from below). Rhodes cityscape, the island of Rhodes, the Dodecanese, Greece.jpg|thumb|Suleiman mosque (view from below), [[Rhodes (city)]]]]\n\nThus began a period of several hundred years in the [[Ottoman Empire]]. The Dodecanese formed a [[Sanjak of Rhodes|separate province]] within the [[Eyalet of the Archipelago]]. The population was allowed to retain a number of privileges provided it submitted to Ottoman rule. By Suleiman's edict, they paid a special tax in return for a special autonomous status that prohibited Ottoman generals from interfering in their civil affairs or mistreating the population. These guarantees, combined with a strategic location at the crossroads of Mediterranean shipping, allowed the islands to prosper. The overwhelmingly Greek population (only Rhodes and Kos had Turkish communities) leaned heavily towards Greece following its declaration of independence in 1822, and many of the islanders joined the [[Greek War of Independence]], with the result that the northern portion of the Dodecanese (including [[Samos]]) became briefly the Greek provinces of the [[Eastern Sporades]] and [[Southern Sporades]]. [[Kasos]] in particular played  a prominent role due to its skilled mariners, until its [[Kasos massacre|destruction]] by the Egyptians in 1824. Most of the islands were slated to become part of the new Greek state in the [[London Protocol of 1828]], but when Greek independence was recognized in the [[London Protocol of 1830]], the islands were left outside the new [[Kingdom of Greece (Gl\u00fccksburg)|Kingdom of Greece]]. Indeed, the 19th century turned out to be one of the islands' most prosperous, and a number of mansions date from this era.\n\n====Turks of the Dodecanese====\n{{Main article|Turks of the Dodecanese}}\nThere is a [[Turkish people|Turkish]] Muslim minority living in [[Rhodes]] and [[Kos]].

The occupation continued after Italy declared war on the Ottoman Empire (21 August 1915) during the First World War.\n\nDuring the war, the islands became an important [[naval base]] for Britain and France; Italy was allied with both nations during [[World War I]]. The Dodecanese were used as a [[staging area]] for numerous campaigns, most famously the one at [[Gallipoli Campaign|Gallipoli]]. Some of the smaller islands were occupied by the French and British, but Rhodes remained under Italian occupation. In 1915, the French also occupied Kastellorizo.\n\nFollowing the war, the [[Tommaso Tittoni|Tittoni]]\u2013[[Eleftherios Venizelos|Venizelos]] agreement, signed on July 29, 1919, called for the smaller islands to join with Greece, while Italy maintained control of Rhodes. The treaty further outlined an exchange where Italy would receive [[Antalya]] for southwest [[Anatolia]]. The Greek defeat in the [[Greco-Turkish War (1919-1922)|Greco-Turkish War]] and the foundation of modern Turkey prevented the exchange. Italy formally annexed the Dodecanese as the ''[[Possedimenti Italiani dell'Egeo]]'' under the terms of the [[Treaty of Lausanne]]. Mussolini embarked on a program of [[Italianization]], hoping to make Rhodes a modern transportation hub that would serve as a focal point for the spread of Italian culture in the Levant. The islands were overwhelmingly [[Greek language|Greek-speaking]], with a [[Turkish language|Turkish-speaking]] minority and an even smaller [[Ladino language|Ladino]]-speaking [[Jew]]ish minority. Immigrant [[Italian language|Italian speakers]] were a marginal language community.\n\nThe Fascist program, in its many attempts to modernize the islands, eradicated [[malaria]], and constructed [[hospital]]s, [[aqueduct (watercourse)|aqueducts]], a [[power plant]] to provide Rhodes' capital with [[electric lighting]], and established the Dodecanese [[Cadastre]]. The main castle of the Knights of St. John was also rebuilt. The concrete-dominated Fascist architectural style detracted significantly from the islands' picturesque scenery (and also reminded the inhabitants of Italian rule), and has consequently been largely demolished or remodeled, apart from the famous example of the [[Leros]] town of [[Lakki, Leros|Lakki]], which remains a prime example of the architecture.\n\nFrom 1936 to 1940 [[Cesare Maria De Vecchi]] acted as Governor of the [[Italian Islands of the Aegean]] promoting the official use of the Italian language and favoring a process of [[italianization]], interrupted by the beginning of [[World War II]].<ref>{{cite book |url={{Google books |plainurl=yes |id=fJ3gVGqB1uQC |page=436 }} |title=The Dodecanese and the East Aegean ... |publisher= |date= |accessdate=2009-07-19 |page=436 | isbn=978-1-85828-883-3}}</ref> In the 1936 Italian census of the Dodecanese islands, the total population was 129,135, of which 7,015 were Italians.\n\n===World War II===\n{{main|Dodecanese campaign}}\n[[File:LerosWarCemetery2.JPG|thumb|WWII cemetery in [[Leros]]]]\n\nDuring World War II, Italy joined the [[Axis Powers]], which used the Dodecanese as a naval staging area for their [[invasion of Crete]] in 1941. After the [[Armistice with Italy|surrender of Italy]] in September 1943, the islands briefly became a battleground between the [[Nazi Germany|Germans]] and [[Allies of World War II|Allied]] forces, including the Italians. The Germans prevailed in the [[Dodecanese Campaign]], and although they were driven out of mainland Greece in 1944, the Dodecanese remained occupied until the end of the war in 1945, during which time nearly the entire Jewish population of 6,000 was [[Holocaust|deported and killed]]. Only 1,200 of these [[Judaeo-Spanish|Ladino]]-speaking Jews survived by escaping to the nearby coast of [[Turkey]]. On 8 May 1945 the German garrison commander [[Otto Wagener]] surrendered the islands to the British on Rhodes handing over 5,000 German and 600 Italian military personnel.<ref>{{cite web|last=Hearfield|first=John|title=German surrender of the Dodecanese islands|url=http://www.johnhearfield.com/Bob/Dodecanese/Occupation.htm|accessdate=23 April 2014}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Diaf\u00e1ni \u2013 Fountain of Neptune - 1.jpg|thumb|Modern fountain of Neptune in Diaf\u00e1ni, [[Karpathos]]]]\n[[File:Kalymnos port.JPG|thumb|[[Kalymnos]]]]\n\n===Post-World War II===\n[[File:Symi houses Greece.jpg|thumb|[[Symi]]]]\n[[File:Kastro.jpg|thumb|[[Leros]]]]\n[[File:IMFJ Astypalea 2006 1.jpg|thumb|[[Astypalaia]]]]\n\nFollowing the war, the islands became a British military protectorate, and were almost immediately allowed to run their own civil affairs, upon which the islands became informally united with Greece, though under separate sovereignty and military control. Despite objections from [[Turkey]], which desired the islands as well, they were formally united with Greece by the [[Treaty of peace with Italy (1947)|1947 Peace Treaty with Italy]], ending 740 years of foreign rule over the islands. \n\nAs a legacy of its former status as a jurisdiction separate from Greece, it is still considered a separate \"entity\" for [[amateur radio]] purposes, essentially maintaining its status as an independent country \"on the air.\" Amateur Radio call signs in the Dodecanese begin with the [[ITU prefix|prefix]] SV5 instead of SV for Greece.<ref>{{cite web|title=European DXCC Entities|url=http://www.ng3k.com/Dxcc/dxcceu.html|website=www.ng3k.com|accessdate=18 December 2016}}</ref>\n\nThe 70th anniversary of the incorporation of the Dodecanese within Greece was marked in 2017,<ref>''[http://www.jp-newsgate.net/en/2017/03/06/30625#more-30625 HIS BEATITUDE THE PATRIARCH OF JERUSALEM AT THE CEREMONY OF THE 70TH INCORPORATION ANNIVERSARY OF THE DODECANESE WITHIN GREECE].''

From its early beginnings to the present day, almost all historical styles are represented, including many monuments from various historical periods. Some of them are [[List of World Heritage Sites in the Czech Republic|UNESCO World Heritage Sites]].\n\n== Gothic ==\n{{main|Czech Gothic architecture}}\n\n== Renaissance ==\n{{main|Czech Renaissance architecture}}\n\n== Baroque ==\n{{main|Czech Baroque architecture}}\n\n== Classicism ==\nAlthough [[Rococo|late Baroque]] in the Czech lands is mainly associated with the reign of [[Maria Theresa]] (1740-1780), after her death, this style was more and more often replaced by [[Neoclassical architecture|classicism]], and ultimately by [[Empire style|imperial style]]. The transition from Baroque to [[Classicism]] is announced by the reconstruction of [[Prague Castle]] by the Viennese architect [[Nicolo Pacassi]]. He and [[Kilian Ignaz Dientzenhofer|Kili\u00e1n Ign\u00e1c Dientzenhofer]] were followed by [[Ign\u00e1c Jan Nepomuk Palliardi]], in whom the already high Baroque tradition is combined with Classicist decor. [[Anton\u00edn Haffenecker]], another architect who went from Baroque to Classicism ([[Estates Theatre]]), is associated with [[Nicol\u00f2 Pacassi|Pacassi]] and [[Johann Bernhard Fischer von Erlach|Johann Bernhard Fischer]].\n\nIn the entire [[Austrian Empire]], i.e. in the Czech lands, there were no suitable conditions for the equally successful development of classical architecture as in [[French architecture|France]] or [[Russian architecture|Russia]]. In the Czech Republic, it is difficult to find a building from the early Classicist period. The reason for the slow development was the ideals of the Enlightenment, which were more restrictive of the old than the new. \n\nDuring Maria Theresa's reign, compulsory schooling was introduced, which clearly contributed to the education of the empire's population. Her son, [[Joseph II, Holy Roman Emperor|Emperor Joseph II]], initiated the so-called [[Josephinism|Josephine reforms]], during which hundreds of churches and monasteries were abolished throughout the Empire, entire orders were dissolved, and the abandoned buildings were transformed into offices, public hospitals or barracks. In Austria the [[bourgeoisie]] developed slowly, which was not strong enough to push through the changes and put an end to [[Feudalism in the Holy Roman Empire|feudalism]] because it feared the atrocities that took place in [[French Revolution|revolutionary France]]. That's why classicism in the Czech lands was lagging behind and manifested itself sporadically in less important buildings. \n[[File:Schloss-Kolosoruk-1.jpg|thumb|[[Korozluky]] Castle]]\nThe evolution of Classicism from the Baroque period is quite evident, as figurative ornaments are gradually being abandoned and the richness of the ornamentation gives way to late Classicism buildings, which have been transformed into strict empire-building lines.\n\nExamples might include [[Duchcov Chateau]], [[Karlova Koruna Chateau]], [[Kyn\u017evart Castle]].\n\n== Empire style ==\n[[File:Z\u00e1mek Ka\u010dina - 01.jpg|thumb|[[Ka\u010dina]] Castle in Chotkov]]\nThe period of [[Empire style|imperial style]] is mainly associated with the [[First French Empire]] under Napoleon I. \n{{main|Empire style}}\nTypical for Empire buildings are clean, regular shapes with minimal decoration, lines are straight to raw. The main feature of Empire architecture is a frequent use of characteristic columns and triangular facades of larger buildings.\n\nThe most important building in the Empire style is [[Ka\u010dina|Ka\u010dina Chotkov Castle]], but also interesting are Fry\u0161t\u00e1t (Lottyhaus) castle in [[Karvin\u00e1]], Boskovice, Pohansko ([[Lednice\u2013Valtice Cultural Landscape]]) and [[Kostelec nad Orlic\u00ed]] Castle. An interesting example of the transition from classicism to the Empire style is the new chateau in [[Da\u010dice]].\n\n== Modern period ==\n\n=== Secession ===\nThe wave of [[Art Nouveau]] at the turn of the 19th and 20th centuries was significant in Czech architecture. Typical are Art Nouveau buildings, especially as private villas, hotels or public buildings (town hall, schools, crematoria), as well as several churches or castle buildings.\n[[Image:Jugendstil Prag Gemeindehaus 1.jpg|thumb|[[Municipal House]]]]\n\nThe most important Czech architects of this period are [[Anton\u00edn Bal\u0161\u00e1nek]], [[Osvald Pol\u00edvka]], [[Josef Fanta]], [[Jan Letzel]], [[Alphonse Mucha|Alfons Mucha]].\n\nImportant monuments include [[Municipal House]], [[Vr\u0161ovice Savings Bank Building]], [[Praha hlavn\u00ed n\u00e1dra\u017e\u00ed]], [[Brno hlavn\u00ed n\u00e1dra\u017e\u00ed]], [[Villa B\u00edlek]], [[\u0160aloun Villa]], [[Hotel Paris (Prague)]], [[Vinohrady Theatre]], [[J. K. Tyl Theatre]], [[City of Prague Museum]].\n\n=== Cubism ===\n{{main|Czech cubism}}\n[[File:Prag Kubismus Schwarze Madonna 1.jpg|thumb|left|[[House of the Black Madonna]]]]\nCubism appeared at the beginning of the 20th century as an avant-garde artistic movement based on completely new ideas. The term \"[[Cubism]]\" was first used by the French art critic [[Louis Vauxcelles]] in 1908.\nThe principle of Cubism is based on the [[Spatial analysis|spatial]] concept of a work of art, in which it captures objects not only from one angle but from several angles at once. The presented object has been distributed into basic geometric shapes (mainly [[Cube|cubes]]). Therefore, Cubism had to solve new problems of perspective and create new spatial relations between the objects. Three-dimensional objects created many views with unusual angles.[[File:Czech-03841 - Cubist Building (32865168462).jpg|thumb|Cubist architecture in Prague]]\nCubism directly or indirectly influenced the development of new artistic styles ([[futurism]], [[Constructivism (art)|constructivism]], and [[expressionism]]). However, unlike other movements, Cubism had no expression in literature. It manifested itself mainly in painting, sculpture, and partly also in the architecture of the former [[First Czechoslovak Republic|Czechoslovakia]], where it became an independent artistic style.\n[[File:D\u016fm_U_\u010dern\u00e9_Matky_Bo\u017e\u00ed_kav\u00e1rna_2.jpg|thumb|Grand Caf\u00e9 Orient in Prague]]\nCubism manifested itself primarily in the fine arts ([[Pablo Picasso|Picasso]], [[Georges Braque|Braque]], [[Paul C\u00e9zanne|C\u00e9zanne]]), which strongly influenced some architects, but one cannot speak of pure cubism, because of course, they had to be primarily functional. The architects working under the influence of Cubism created characteristic objects that seem a bit strange. Cubist architecture in Czechoslovakia has been operating since around 1911. In the 1920s, it developed in Prague. Its most prominent representatives gathered in the Manes Fine Arts Association. They include painters [[Emil Filla]], [[Anton\u00edn Proch\u00e1zka (painter)|Anton\u00edn Proch\u00e1zka]] and [[Josef \u010capek]], sculptor [[Otto Gutfreund]],  architects [[Josef Go\u010d\u00e1r]], [[Josef Chochol]], [[Pavel Jan\u00e1k]], and others. \n\nThe Cubist style is unique in the world and nowhere else has Cubist architecture reached such a boom as in the Czech Republic.\n\nArchitects:\n\n* [[Josef Go\u010d\u00e1r]]\n* [[Josef Chochol]]\n* [[Pavel Jan\u00e1k]]\n* [[Otakar Novotn\u00fd]]\n* [[Vlastislav Hofman]]\n\n=== Rondocubism ===\n[[Rondocubism]] is an independent local formula of Czech architecture. It developed as an independent branch of the Cubist style after World War I in the newly established [[Czechoslovakia]], where it became the national style for a short time. \n[[File:Prague Cubim Adria Palace.jpg|thumb|Adria Palace (Prague)]]\nRondocubism, as the name suggests, is characterized by the use of round shapes such as arches, circles, and ovals, which are based on Cubist foundations. These were to commemorate national [[List of Slavic cultures|Slavic traditions]]. Rondocubism was most evident in Prague, but also in other places, especially in the form of industrial architecture. The highest buildings in the world of Rondocubism are considered to be [[Legiobanka]] by [[Josef Go\u010d\u00e1r]] and Adria Palace by [[Pavel Jan\u00e1k]] in Prague.\n\nRondo-Cubism has also manifested itself in art, for example in the paintings of [[Josef \u010capek|Josef \u010cape]]<nowiki/>k and Objectdesign. Furniture created by [[Bohumil Waigant]] and Josef Go\u010d\u00e1r is still preserved.\n\nRondocubism in architecture tried to contain characteristic Slavic elements. The use of national colors: red and white should also help. The shapes of rondocubist buildings are usually massive, cylindrical, round, similar to annual wooden rings.\n\nThe seat of the Legiobanka in Na Po\u0159\u00ed\u010d\u00ed Street is a rondocubist monument from 1921-1923. Its facade was decorated by [[Otto Gutfreund]] and [[Jan \u0160tursa]]. The stained-glass windows in the hall and decorative bricks are the work of [[Franti\u0161ek Kysel]].\n\nThe Adria Palace, built in 1925 by Pavel Jan\u00e1k and German architect Josef Zasch from Prague, on Jungmann Square for the Italian insurance company Riunione Adriatica di Sicurt\u00e0. The sculptural decoration is the work of [[Jan \u0160tursa]] and Karl Dvo\u0159\u00e1k. In 1926, during a conference in Prague, when the French architect [[Le Corbusier]] saw the Adria Palace, he called it \"a massive structure with an [[Assyria|Assyrian]] appearance\".\n\nThe Rondocubist furniture in the house on Kamenick\u00e1 Street in [[Hole\u0161ovice]] is the work of Otakar Novotny.\n\n=== Functionalism ===\n[[File:Brno, Lipov\u00e1.jpg|thumb|left|Semi-detached villa in [[Brno]] by [[Otto Eisler]], according to [[Museum of Modern Art|MoMA]]'s [[Henry-Russell Hitchcock]] and [[Philip Johnson]], is a defining building of the [[International Style (architecture)|International style]].]]\n[[Functionalism (architecture)|Functionalist]] [[Villa Tugendhat]] is one of the most famous examples of Czech architecture of the 20th century and is a [[World Heritage Site|UNESCO World Heritage Site]].\n[[File:Praha,_Spo\u0159ilov,_kostel_sv._Ane\u017eky_-_v\u011b\u017e.jpg|thumb|Church of Saint Agnes of Bohemia (Spo\u0159ilov)]]\nSince the 1920s, architecture has been striving for functionalism, an architectural style that primarily applies the criteria of functionality, usability and practical purpose. This direction is guided by the motto \"form follows function\", which in practice manifests itself in simple, sometimes even austere lines.\n\nThe main representatives of this direction in the Czech lands were architects [[Jan Kot\u011bra]] and [[Josef Go\u010d\u00e1r]], as well as the prominent [[Architecture of Slovenia|Slovenian]] architect [[Jo\u017ee Ple\u010dnik|Josip Ple\u010dnik]]. He was the author of the [[Church of the Most Sacred Heart of Our Lord|Church of the Sacred Heart of Jesus]] in Prague. Another important foreign architect working in Czechoslovakia was [[Ludwig Mies van der Rohe]], author of ''Villa Tugendhat''.\n\nImportant monuments include: [[National Gallery Prague]], [[Ba\u0165a's Skyscraper]], [[Tomas Bata Memorial]], [[Barrandov Terraces]], [[Hus Congregational House]], [[Agudas Achim Synagogue (Brno)]], [[Sm\u00edchov Synagogue]].\n\n== Late and postmodernism ==\n\n=== Socialist realism ===\nIn the 1950s [[socialist realism]] (also called sorela) was required as an official style. Characteristic buildings in its spirit are the Jalta Hotel on [[Wenceslas Square]] or the [[Poruba (Ostrava)|Poruba]] housing estate in [[Ostrava]]. A specific branch of Sorela was the so-called [[Stalinist architecture|Stalinist neoclassicism]], which represents [[Hotel International Prague|Hotel International]] in Prague's [[Dejvice]].\n\n=== Brussels style ===\nHowever, in the late 1950s, the new style, known as \"Brussels\", became popular in architecture (and of course in design), as it was presented at [[Expo 58]] in [[Brussels]]. It was characterized by round shapes and glass facades. A typical building in the Brussels style was the Czech Expo pavilion (no longer existing) and the building of the Czech restaurant (currently in [[Letn\u00e1 Park]], Prague). Other important buildings in the Brussels style are the Z pavilion in the [[Brno Exhibition Centre|exhibition center in Brno]], the [[Podol\u00ed Swimming Stadium|swimming pool in Podol\u00ed]] and the [[Hav\u00ed\u0159ov railway station|railway station]] in [[Hav\u00ed\u0159ov]].\n\n=== Czech brutalism ===\n[[File:Transgas II., model.jpg|thumb|[[Transgas (building)]]]]\nIn the late 1960s, the Czech version of [[Brutalist architecture|brutalism]] replaced the Brussels style. The projects of [[V\u011bra Machoninov\u00e1]] and her husband Vladim\u00edr Machon\u00edn (residential community center in Prague, Hotel Thermal in [[Karlovy Vary]], [[Kotva Department Store|Kotva]] in Prague, the Czechoslovak embassy in Berlin) are particularly appreciated. \n\nOther buildings include the [[Embassy of the Czech Republic, London|Czechoslovak embassy in London]] (architects [[Jan Bo\u010dan]], Jan \u0160r\u00e1mek and [[Karel \u0160t\u011bp\u00e1nsk\u00fd]]), the [[Hotel InterContinental Prague|Intercontinental Hotel]] (Karel Buben\u00ed\u010dek and Karel Filsak), [[Karel Prager]] buildings (former [[Federal Assembly (Czechoslovakia)|Federal Assembly building]], New Stage of the [[National Theatre (Prague)|National Theatre]]). However, the most valued building of that time was a transmitter and hotel on [[Je\u0161t\u011bd Tower|Je\u0161t\u011bd]], by [[Karel Hub\u00e1\u010dek]].\n\n=== Postmodern architecture ===\nThe [[Dancing House]] of Frank Gehry and Vlado Milu\u0148 in Prague, which was initiated directly by [[V\u00e1clav Havel]], is often referred to as a symbol of [[Postmodern architecture|post-modern architecture]]. [[Jean Nouvel]] ([[Golden Angel]] in Prague's [[Sm\u00edchov|Smichov]]) or [[Ricardo Bofill]] were among the most important architects in Prague at that time. \n\nOthers include the project of transforming the [[Central Business District Praha|surroundings of the Masaryk station]], which was prepared by the [[Pritzker Architecture Prize|Pritzker Prize]] winner [[Zaha Hadid]]. Among other projects, the [[Czech National Library of Technology|National Technical Library]] in Prague's [[Dejvice]] district received the greatest recognition. The widely discussed design of the new building of the [[National Library of the Czech Republic|National Library]] of [[Jan Kaplick\u00fd|Jan Kaplicky]] remained only on paper. Among the successful contemporary Czech architects is [[Eva Ji\u0159i\u010dn\u00e1]], who designed, for example, the Orangery at Prague Castle, Zl\u00edn Congress Centre and other buildings abroad.\n\n==Literature and sources==\n* \u010cERN\u00c1, Marie.

From its early beginnings to the present day, almost all historical styles are represented, including many monuments from various historical periods. Some of them are [[List of World Heritage Sites in the Czech Republic|UNESCO World Heritage Sites]].\n\n== Gothic ==\n{{main|Czech Gothic architecture}}\n\n== Renaissance ==\n{{main|Czech Renaissance architecture}}\n\n== Baroque ==\n{{main|Czech Baroque architecture}}\n\n== Classicism ==\nAlthough [[Rococo|late Baroque]] in the Czech lands is mainly associated with the reign of [[Maria Theresa]] (1740-1780), after her death, this style was more and more often replaced by [[Neoclassical architecture|classicism]], and ultimately by [[Empire style|imperial style]]. The transition from Baroque to [[Classicism]] is announced by the reconstruction of [[Prague Castle]] by the Viennese architect [[Nicolo Pacassi]]. He and [[Kilian Ignaz Dientzenhofer|Kili\u00e1n Ign\u00e1c Dientzenhofer]] were followed by [[Ign\u00e1c Jan Nepomuk Palliardi]], in whom the already high Baroque tradition is combined with Classicist decor. [[Anton\u00edn Haffenecker]], another architect who went from Baroque to Classicism ([[Estates Theatre]]), is associated with [[Nicol\u00f2 Pacassi|Pacassi]] and [[Johann Bernhard Fischer von Erlach|Johann Bernhard Fischer]].\n\nIn the entire [[Austrian Empire]], i.e. in the Czech lands, there were no suitable conditions for the equally successful development of classical architecture as in [[French architecture|France]] or [[Russian architecture|Russia]]. In the Czech Republic, it is difficult to find a building from the early Classicist period. The reason for the slow development was the ideals of the Enlightenment, which were more restrictive of the old than the new. \n\nDuring Maria Theresa's reign, compulsory schooling was introduced, which clearly contributed to the education of the empire's population. Her son, [[Joseph II, Holy Roman Emperor|Emperor Joseph II]], initiated the so-called [[Josephinism|Josephine reforms]], during which hundreds of churches and monasteries were abolished throughout the Empire, entire orders were dissolved, and the abandoned buildings were transformed into offices, public hospitals or barracks. In Austria the [[bourgeoisie]] developed slowly, which was not strong enough to push through the changes and put an end to [[Feudalism in the Holy Roman Empire|feudalism]] because it feared the atrocities that took place in [[French Revolution|revolutionary France]].

[[Jean Nouvel]] ([[Golden Angel]] in Prague's [[Sm\u00edchov|Smichov]]) or [[Ricardo Bofill]] were among the most important architects in Prague at that time. \n\nOthers include the project of transforming the [[Central Business District Praha|surroundings of the Masaryk station]], which was prepared by the [[Pritzker Architecture Prize|Pritzker Prize]] winner [[Zaha Hadid]]. Among other projects, the [[Czech National Library of Technology|National Technical Library]] in Prague's [[Dejvice]] district received the greatest recognition. The widely discussed design of the new building of the [[National Library of the Czech Republic|National Library]] of [[Jan Kaplick\u00fd|Jan Kaplicky]] remained only on paper. Among the successful contemporary Czech architects is [[Eva Ji\u0159i\u010dn\u00e1]], who designed, for example, the Orangery at Prague Castle, Zl\u00edn Congress Centre and other buildings abroad.\n\n==Literature and sources==\n* \u010cERN\u00c1, Marie.
