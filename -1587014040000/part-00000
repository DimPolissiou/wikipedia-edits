He envisioned Sand Springs as a haven for orphans and widows.  He helped found and develop Sand Springs as a model city that included all components of a total community.<ref name=\"EOHC-SS\">[http://www.okhistory.org/publications/enc/entry.php?entry=SA017 Carl N. Gregory, \"Sand Springs\", ''Encyclopedia of Oklahoma History and Culture''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150402133246/http://www.okhistory.org/publications/enc/entry.php?entry=SA017 |date=2015-04-02 }}, Accessed May 6, 2011.</ref>\n\nPage bought 160 acres of land in Tulsa County, Oklahoma in 1908, intending to build a home for orphan children. The first 27 children, who had been abandoned by the Hook & Anchor Orphanage in Tulsa,<!-- what does this mean? they threw the orphans out? --> were housed in a tent. This was soon replaced by a frame building large enough to house 50 children.\n\nPage decided to form a model community, to be called Sand Springs, on land west of the children's home. He offered free land to any person who wished to move there, and a $20,000 bonus (the amount varied and he also offered free utilities) to companies that would relocate there. In 1911, Page created the [[Sand Springs Railway]], an interurban connecting Sand Springs to Tulsa. The townsite was laid out the same year.<ref name = \"EOHC-SS\"/> Sand Springs was incorporated as a city in 1912, with a population of 400.<ref name=\"Davenport\">{{cite web|url=http://www.tulsaokhistory.com/cities/sandsprings.html|title=History of Sand Springs, OK|website=www.tulsaokhistory.com|accessdate=24 April 2018|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171107112750/http://www.tulsaokhistory.com/cities/sandsprings.html|archivedate=7 November 2017}}</ref>\n\nIn 1911 Page also built the Sand Springs Power Plant, on the southeast corner of Main Street and Morrow Road. It anchored an area that Page intended to use for industrial development. Several significant additions were made to the facility, and it was the sole source of electric power for Sand Springs until 1947.<ref>National Register of Historic Places Registration Form. \"Sand Springs Power Plant.\"</ref>\n\nSome of the earliest manufacturing industries were: Kerr Glass Manufacturing; Commander Mills, Kerr, Hubbard and Kelley Lamp, and Chimney; Southwest Box Company; and Sinclair Prairie Refining Company. Medical and social welfare institutions other than the Sand Springs Home included the Oakwood Sanitorium for nervous and mental diseases, Poole Hospital, the Salvation Army Maternity Home, and the Sand Springs School for the Deaf.<ref name = \"Davenport\" /> Sand Springs became a center of glass production in Oklahoma. Kerr Glass Manufacturing moved to Sand Springs from Chicago in 1913. It and the Alexander H. Kerr company, which made fruit jars, were the only glass companies remaining in business as recently as 1955.<ref name=\"EOHC-Glass\">[http://digital.library.okstate.edu/encyclopedia/entries/G/GL002.html Everett, Dianna. \"Glass Manufacturing\"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110609161551/http://digital.library.okstate.edu/encyclopedia/entries/G/GL002.html |date=2011-06-09 }}, ''Encyclopedia of Oklahoma History and Culture''.</ref>\n\nThe Children's Home is still operating. What used to be the Widows Colony now accepts single mothers with two or more children.\n\nAn EF2 tornado hit Sand Springs on March 25, 2015, killing one resident, injuring 30 citizens, and damaging 50 mobile homes.<ref>https://www.weather.gov/oun/tornadodata-county-ok-tulsa</ref>\n\nOn November 26, 2018, Clyde Boyd Middle School had a [[Carbon Monoxide]] leak. The leak started sometime around the morning. Between 11:15 and 12:58, five students went homesick. And between 1:15 to 1:35, seven more students got sick.<ref>https://www.newson6.com/story/39546855/middle-school-students-treated-after-sand-springs-carbon-monoxide-leak</ref> Around 2:27, an announcement on the intercom told all the students to \"go to the new gym\". Many students went to the hospital from [[Carbon Monoxide Poisoning]]. \"There was no evidence of the presence of carbon monoxide in the 6th Grade Center\". Over 50 students were sent to nearby hospitals. The school didn't have carbon monoxide detectors at the time which the district says \"it'll resolve\". The School was closed for several days while they fixed the problem. <ref>https://www.newson6.com/story/39553912/sand-springs-school-still-closed-after-carbon-monoxide-leak</ref> \nThe district has now installed [[carbon monoxide detectors]].\n\n==Geography==\nSand Springs is located at {{coord|36|8|23|N|96|6|32|W|type:city}} (36.1398102, -96.1088911).<ref>{{GNIS|1092617}}</ref> According to the [[United States Census Bureau]], the city has a total area of 21.0&nbsp;square miles (54.3&nbsp;km\u00b2), of which, 18.7&nbsp;square miles (48.4&nbsp;km\u00b2) of it is land and 2.3&nbsp;square miles (5.9&nbsp;km\u00b2) of it (10.84%) is water.

He envisioned Sand Springs as a haven for orphans and widows.  He helped found and develop Sand Springs as a model city that included all components of a total community.<ref name=\"EOHC-SS\">[http://www.okhistory.org/publications/enc/entry.php?entry=SA017 Carl N.

The first 27 children, who had been abandoned by the Hook & Anchor Orphanage in Tulsa,<!-- what does this mean? they threw the orphans out? --> were housed in a tent. This was soon replaced by a frame building large enough to house 50 children.\n\nPage decided to form a model community, to be called Sand Springs, on land west of the children's home. He offered free land to any person who wished to move there, and a $20,000 bonus (the amount varied and he also offered free utilities) to companies that would relocate there. In 1911, Page created the [[Sand Springs Railway]], an interurban connecting Sand Springs to Tulsa. The townsite was laid out the same year.<ref name = \"EOHC-SS\"/> Sand Springs was incorporated as a city in 1912, with a population of 400.<ref name=\"Davenport\">{{cite web|url=http://www.tulsaokhistory.com/cities/sandsprings.html|title=History of Sand Springs, OK|website=www.tulsaokhistory.com|accessdate=24 April 2018|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171107112750/http://www.tulsaokhistory.com/cities/sandsprings.html|archivedate=7 November 2017}}</ref>\n\nIn 1911 Page also built the Sand Springs Power Plant, on the southeast corner of Main Street and Morrow Road. It anchored an area that Page intended to use for industrial development. Several significant additions were made to the facility, and it was the sole source of electric power for Sand Springs until 1947.<ref>National Register of Historic Places Registration Form. \"Sand Springs Power Plant.\"</ref>\n\nSome of the earliest manufacturing industries were: Kerr Glass Manufacturing; Commander Mills, Kerr, Hubbard and Kelley Lamp, and Chimney; Southwest Box Company; and Sinclair Prairie Refining Company. Medical and social welfare institutions other than the Sand Springs Home included the Oakwood Sanitorium for nervous and mental diseases, Poole Hospital, the Salvation Army Maternity Home, and the Sand Springs School for the Deaf.<ref name = \"Davenport\" /> Sand Springs became a center of glass production in Oklahoma. Kerr Glass Manufacturing moved to Sand Springs from Chicago in 1913. It and the Alexander H.

{"title_page": "Journalistic objectivity", "text_new": "With objectivity being something that can be extremely difficult to achieve due to its guidelines, comes many critics. Some believe that objectivity becomes meaningless because it is impossible from journalists to achieve truthfulness, fairness, and detachment to the fullest extent because it rests on the observation that 'journalists are human beings\"-- meaning that they have a gender, ethnicity, family, a social background, personal history, this all meaning that when a journalist believes they can put all of these factors aside they fail to see how their own conscious and unconscious motivations are affecting how they report. It is also critiqued because as journalism has expanded any basically anyone can be a self-proclaimed journalist, not all of the same rules are in place for those who are professionals or those who have a small blog. To further that, journalistic writing is seen as a discipline rather than just a personal platform for ideas and opinions. The lines begin to become blurred, but they can only be meaningful when they support the wider project of objectivity: which is an open-ended pursuit of truth. If, on the other hand, the norms of professional journalistic practice become hardened into a strict set of rules, then journalism is just a discipline reduced to meaningless habits[[User:Taylorbruce23|Taylorbruce23]] ([[User talk:Taylorbruce23|talk]]) 02:48, 16 April 2020 (UTC)\n\nthe rise and fall of objectivity \n\nThe rise of objectivity has many layers of how it came to be, and it was most prominent throughout history when reporting on wars were at the forefront of journalism. The establishment of objectivity as a clear professional ethic of journalism after the First World War went hand in hand with a joint and conscious effort to \u2018manage\u2019 a dangerous public opinion. And during these times news platforms like the BBC were presented with the opportunity of \u201cimpartiality\u201d The explicit promotion of journalistic objectivity was an attempt to cope with this situation by finding ways to retain credibility with the mass audience. It was also a tool for managing public opinion: the rise of public relations in the inter-war period indicated the elite\u2019s pressing concern with handling an unruly and unpredictable mass public by \u2018engineering\u2019 or \u2018manufacturing\u2019 consent as stated by Edward Bernays and Walter Lippmann the fall of objectivity The traditional professional routines of journalism were potentially more than mere \u2018rituals\u2019: practices such as fact-checking or seeking out both sides of a story offered ways to overcome the limitations of one\u2019s own subjective impressions and to get at the truth. Today, there is less sense of a necessity to transcend the personal and impressionistic.\n\nIt is often suggested that traditional forms of journalism have been undermined by the wide availability of access to journalism, as masses of amateurs with camera phones and laptops present a variety of perspectives directly to the public that the formerly authoritative discourse of the professional reporter is reduced to merely one voice among many. But it could just as plausibly be argued that \u2013 at least potentially \u2013 new technologies could help to overcome many of the obstacles to objective journalism.[[User:Taylorbruce23|Taylorbruce23]] ([[User talk:Taylorbruce23|talk]]) 02:48, 16 April 2020 (UTC) \n\n# '''[[User talk:Taylorbruce23/sandbox#cite%20ref-1|^]]''' Calcutt, Andrew, and Philip Hammond.

Journalistic [[objectivity (philosophy)|objectivity]] may refer to [[social justice|fairness]], [[impartiality|disinterestedness]], [[fact]]uality, and [[partisan (political)|nonpartisanship]], but most often encompasses all of these qualities. First evolving as a practice in the 18th century, a number of critiques and alternatives to the notion have emerged since, fuelling ongoing and dynamic [[discourse]]<nowiki> surrounding the ideal of objectivity in journalism. {{</nowiki>'''Citation needed'''<nowiki>}}</nowiki>\n\nMost newspapers and TV stations depend upon [[news agencies]] for their material, and each of the four major global agencies ([[Agence France-Presse]] (formerly the Havas agency), [[Associated Press]], [[Reuters]], and [[Agencia EFE]]) began with and continue to operate on a basic philosophy of providing a single objective news feed to all subscribers. That is, they do not provide separate feeds for conservative or liberal newspapers.  Journalist [[Jonathan Fenby]] has explained  the notion:\n\n<blockquote>''To achieve such wide acceptability, the agencies avoid overt partiality.  Demonstrably correct information is their stock-in-trade.  Traditionally, they report at a reduced level of responsibility, attributing their information to a spokesman, the press, or other sources.  They avoid making judgments and steer clear of doubt and ambiguity.  Though their founders did not use the word, objectivity is the philosophical basis for their enterprises \u2013 or failing that, widely acceptable [[Neutrality (philosophy)|neutrality]].<ref>Jonathan Fenby, ''The International News Services'' (1986) p. 25</ref>''</blockquote>\n\nObjectivity in journalism aims to help the audience make up their own mind about a story, providing the facts alone and then letting audiences interpret those on their own. To maintain objectivity in journalism, journalists should present the facts whether or not they like or agree with those facts. Objective reporting is meant to portray issues and events in a neutral and unbiased manner, regardless of the writer's opinion or personal beliefs.<ref name=\":0\">Clark, Roy Peter.

The journalist must report only the facts and not a personal attitude toward the facts.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=bAP5MOcnH8EC&pg=PA203|title=Discovering Journalism|publisher=Greenwood|year=1999|page=203|author=Warren G. Bov\u00e9e}}</ref> While objectivity is a complex and dynamic notion that may refer to a multitude of techniques and practices, it generally refers to the idea of \"three distinct, yet interrelated, concepts\": truthfulness, [[Neutrality (philosophy)|neutrality]], and detachment.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\nTruthfulness is a commitment to reporting only accurate and truthful information, without skewing any facts or details to improve the story or better align an issue with any certain agenda.<ref name=\":1\" /> Neutrality suggests that stories be reported in an unbiased, even-handed, and impartial manner. Under this notion, journalists are to side with none of the parties involved, and simply provide the relevant facts and information of all.<ref name=\":1\" /> The third idea, detachment, refers to the emotional approach of the journalist. Essentially, reporters should not only approach issues in an unbiased manner but also with a dispassionate and emotionless attitude. Through this strategy, stories can be presented in a rational and calm manner, letting the audience make up their minds without any influences from the media.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\nHistorically, journalism as a profession comes with objectivity. However, journalism objectivity has been challenged by many scholars and criticizing  journalistic objectivity. They argue that objectivity is supposed to be promoting truth and defined as a \u2018correspondence, grounded incorrectness, between thought and reality\u2019 (Heidegger, 1943:1). But  journalism is a bit off track nowadays.\n\n==History==\nThe modern notion of objectivity in journalism is largely due to the work of [[Walter Lippmann]].<ref>[https://www.americanpressinstitute.org/journalism-essentials/bias-objectivity/lost-meaning-objectivity/ The lost meaning of \u2018objectivity\u2019]</ref>  Lippmann was the first to widely call for journalists to use the scientific method for gathering information.<ref>[http://www.nordicom.gu.se/sites/default/files/kapitel-pdf/222_wien.pdf Defining Objectivity within Journalism], [[University of Gothenburg]]</ref> Lippmann called for journalistic objectivity after the excesses of [[yellow journalism]].  He noted that the yellows at the time had served their purpose, but that the people needed to receive the actual news, and not a \"romanticized version of it\".<ref>[https://archive.org/details/KSULKSInd193031V57N1733 Kansas industrialist]. p. 6</ref>\n\nThe term ''objectivity'' was not applied to journalistic work until the 20th century, but it had fully emerged as a guiding principle by the 1890s. Michael Schudson,<ref>[http://www.journalism.columbia.edu/profile/62-michael-schudson/10 Michael Schudson's faculty page] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160405061527/http://www.journalism.columbia.edu/profile/62-michael-schudson/10 |date=2016-04-05 }}; Columbia Journalism School, accessed 20 December 2012</ref> among a number of other communication scholars and historians, agree that the idea of objectivity has prevailed in dominant discourse among journalists in the United States since the appearance of modern newspapers in the [[Jacksonian democracy|Jacksonian Era]] of the 1830s. These papers transformed the press amidst the democratization of politics, the expansion of a market economy, and the growing authority of an entrepreneurial, urban middle class. Before then, American newspapers were expected to present a partisan viewpoint, not a neutral one.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=uLois7_nNMgC&printsec=frontcover&dq=inauthor:%22Michael+Schudson%22&hl=da&ei=7tZHT8m-CIOngwePioX2DQ&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=book-thumbnail&resnum=1&ved=0CDMQ6wEwAA#v=onepage&q=inauthor%3A%22Michael%20Schudson%22&f=false|title=Discovering the News|last=Schudson|first=Michael|year=1978|pages=4}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.mediaethicsmagazine.com/index.php/browse-back-issues/179-fall-2013-vol-25-no-1/3999003-objectivity-and-advocacy-in-journalism|title=Objectivity and Advocacy in Journalism - mediaethicsmagazine.com|website=www.mediaethicsmagazine.com|language=en-gb|access-date=2017-04-19}}</ref>\n\nThe need for objectivity first occurred to Associated Press editors who realize that partisanship would narrow their potential market. Their goal was to reach all newspapers, and leave it to the individual papers to decide on what slanting and commentary were needed.  Lawrence Gobright, the AP chief in Washington, explained the philosophy of objectivity to Congress in 1856:\n\n<blockquote>''My business is to communicate facts.  My instructions do not allow me to make any comments upon the facts which I communicate.  My dispatches are sent to papers of all manner of politics, and the editors say they are able to make their own comments upon the facts which are sent to them.  I, therefore confine myself to what I consider legitimate news.  I do not act as a politician belonging to any school, but try to be truthful and impartial.  My dispatches are merely dry matter of fact and detail.<ref>Richard Schwarzlose, ''Nation's Newsbrokers Volume 1: The Formative Years: From Pretelegraph to 1865'' (1989) p. 179</ref><ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8_Q283mkIIkC&pg=PA81|title=Covering America: A Narrative History of a Nation's Journalism|publisher=Univ of Massachusetts Press|year=2012|page=81|author=Christopher B. Daly}}</ref>''</blockquote>\n\nBut into the first decade of the twentieth century, it was uncommon to see a sharp divide between facts and values. However, during [[World War I]], scholar Stuart Allan (1997) suggests that propaganda campaigns, as well the rise of \"press agents and publicity experts\", fostered the growing cynicism among the public towards state institutions and \"official channels of information\".<ref name=\":1\" /> The elevation of objectivity thus constituted as an effort to re-legitimatize the news-press, as well as the state in general.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\nSome historians, like Gerald Baldasty, have observed that objectivity went hand in hand with the need to make profits in the newspaper business by attracting advertisers. In this economic analysis, publishers did not want to offend any potential advertising clients and therefore encouraged news editors and reporters to strive to present all sides of an issue. Advertisers would remind the press that partisanship hurts circulation, and, consequently, advertising revenues - thus, objectivity was sought.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=sKExQuza2EUC&pg=PA29&lpg=PA29&dq=Gerald+Baldasty+the+rise+of+objectivity#v=onepage&q=Gerald%20Baldasty%20the%20rise%20of%20objectivity&f=false|title=Advertising and a Democratic Press|last=Baker|first=Edwin C.|year=1994|pages=29}}</ref>\n\nOthers have proposed a political explanation for the rise of objectivity; scholars like Richard Kaplan have argued that political parties needed to lose their hold over the loyalties of voters and the institutions of government before the press could feel free to offer a nonpartisan, \"impartial\" account of news events.<ref name=\":2\" /> This change occurred following the critical [[1896 United States presidential election|1896 election]] and the subsequent reform of the [[Progressive Era]].<ref name=\":2\">{{cite book|title=Politics and the American Press: The Rise of Objectivity, 1865\u20131920|last=Kaplan|first=Richard L.|year=2002}}</ref>\n\nLater, during the period following [[World War II]], the newly formalized rules and practices of objectivity led to a brief national consensus and temporary suspension of negative public opinion;<ref name=\":1\" /> however, doubts and uncertainties in \"the institutions of [[democracy]] and [[capitalism]]\" resurfaced in the period of civil unrest during the 1960s and 1970s, ultimately leading to the emergence of the ''critique'' of objectivity.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\nIn conclusion, there are three key factors in the origin of objectivity. The transition from a political model of journalism to a commercial model requires the production of content that can be marketed across the political and ideological spectrum. The telegraph imposes pressures on journalists to prioritize the most important facts at the beginning of the story and adopt a simplified, homogenized and generic style that could appeal to geographically diverse audiences. In the early 20th century, journalism started to define itself as a professional occupation that required special training, unique skills and self-regulation according to ethical principles (Professionalization normalized the regime of objectivity as the foundation of good journalism, providing benefits to journalists and editors/publishers.\n\n== Criticisms ==\n{{See also|View from nowhere}}\n[[File:Megan Willams -Objectivity does not exist (not even for jurnalists).webm|thumb|left|Megan Willams (journalist), ...''Objectivity does not exist (especially for journalists)...'' interviewed in [[Varanasi]] in December 2010 by Vrinda Dar]]\n\nSome scholars and journalists criticize the understanding of objectivity as neutrality or nonpartisanship, arguing that it does a disservice to the public because it fails to attempt to find truth.<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite book|title=Journalism Studies: A Critical Introduction |last=Calcutt |first=Andrew |last2=Hammond |first2=Phillip |publisher=Routledge |year=2011 |isbn=0-203-83174-8 |location=USA & Canada|pages=97\u2013114}}</ref> They also argue that such objectivity is nearly impossible to apply in practice\u2014newspapers inevitably take a point of view in deciding what stories to cover, which to feature on the front page, and what sources they quote.<ref name=\":1\" /> The media critics [[Edward S. Herman]] and [[Noam Chomsky]] have advanced a [[propaganda model]] hypothesis proposing that such a notion of objectivity results in heavily favoring government viewpoints and large corporations.<ref name=\":1\" /> Mainstream commentators accept that [[news value]] drives selection of stories, but there is some debate as to whether catering to an audience's level of interest in a story makes the selection process non-objective.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\nAnother example of an objection to objectivity, according to communication scholar [[David Mindich]], was the coverage that the major papers (most notably the ''[[New York Times]]'') gave to the [[lynching]] of thousands of African Americans during the 1890s.<ref name=\":4\" /> News stories of the period described the hanging, immolation and mutilation of people by mobs with detachment and, through the regimen of objectivity, news writers often attempted to construct a \"[[false balance]]\" of these accounts by recounting the alleged transgressions of the victims that provoked the lynch mobs to fury.<ref name=\":4\">{{Cite book|title=African American Journalists: Autobiography as Memoir and Manifesto|last=Hall|first=Calvin|publisher=Scarecrow Press|year=2009|isbn=978-0-8108-6931-8|location=USA|pages=8}}</ref> Mindich suggests that by enabling practices of objectivity and allowing them to \"[go] basically unquestioned\",<ref name=\":4\" /> it may have had the effect of normalizing the practice of lynching.<ref>''Just the Facts: How \"Objectivity\" Came to Define American Journalism'', 1998</ref>\n\nIn a more recent example, scholars Andrew Calcutt and Phillip Hammond (2011) note that since the 1990s, war reporting (especially) has increasingly come to criticize and reject the practice of objectivity.<ref name=\":1\" /> In 1998, a [[BBC News|BBC]] reporter, [[Martin Bell]], noted that he favoured a \"journalism of attachment\", over the previously sought after dispassionate approach.<ref name=\":1\" /><ref>Bell, Martin (1998) \u2018The Journalism of Attachment\u2019, in Matthew Kieran (ed.), Media Ethics, London and New York, NY: Routledge.</ref> Similarly, a [[CNN]] [[war correspondent]] from the US, [[Christiane Amanpour]], stated that in some circumstances \"neutrality can mean you are an accomplice to all sorts of evil\".<ref>Ricchiardi, Sherry (1996) \u2018Over the Line?\u2019, American Journalism Review, 18 (September): 24\u201331.</ref><ref name=\":1\" /> Each of these opinions stems from scholar's and journalist's critique of objectivity as too \"heartless\" or \"forensic\" to report the human natured and emotionally charged issues found in war and conflict reporting.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\nAs discussed above, with the growth of mass media, especially from the 19th century, news advertising became the most important source of media revenue. Whole audiences needed to be engaged across communities and regions to maximize advertising revenue. This led to \"[j]ournalistic [o]bjectivity as an industry standard [\u2026] a set of conventions allowing the news to be presented as all things to all people\".<ref name=\":3\">Lynch, J. & McGoldrick, A. (2005). ''Peace Journalism''. Gloucestershire: Hawthorn Press, p. 203</ref> In modern journalism, especially with the emergence of 24-hour news cycles, speed is of the essence in responding to breaking stories. It is therefore not possible for reporters to decide \"from first principles\" how they will report each and every story that presents itself - thus, some scholars argue that mere convention (versus a true devotion to truth-seeking) has come to govern much of journalism.<ref name=\":3\" />\n\n{{rquote|right|Reporters are biased toward conflict because it is more interesting than stories without conflict; we are biased toward sticking with the pack because it is safe; we are biased toward event-driven coverage because it is easier; we are biased toward existing narratives because they are safe and easy.

He suggests that objectivity makes us passive recipients of news, rather than aggressive analyzers and critics of it.<ref name=\"cjr.org\" /> According to Cunningham, the nut of the tortured relationship with objectivity lies within a number of conflicting diktats that the press was subjected to operate under: be neutral yet investigative; be disengaged yet have an impact; and be fair-minded yet have an edge.<ref name=\"cjr.org\" /> Cunningham, however, argues that reporters by and large are not ideological warriors; rather, they are imperfect people performing a difficult job that is crucial to society and, \"[d]espite all our important and necessary attempts to minimize [individual's] humanity, it can't be any other way,\" Cunningham concludes.<ref name=\"cjr.org\" />\n\nThe debate about objectivity is lit also within the photojournalism field. In 2011, Italian photographer [[Ruben Salvadori]] challenged the expectation of objective truth that the general public associates to photojournalism with his project \"Photojournalism Behind the Scenes\".<ref>{{cite news|title=Hinter den Kulissen des Fotojournalismus|url=http://www.zeit.de/politik/ausland/2012-03/fs-ruben-salvadori-2|newspaper=Die Zeit}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=CBC / Radio Canada - Les Lionnes|url=http://vimeo.com/36256731}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|title=Dietro le Quinte|url=http://www.internazionale.it/portfolio/dietro-le-quinte/|newspaper=Internazionale}}</ref> By including the traditionally invisible photographer into the frame, Salvadori sought to ignite a discussion about the ethics of the profession, and indicate a need for audiences to be  active viewers who understand and recognize the potential subjectivity of the photographic medium.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.nocaptionneeded.com/2012/02/ruben-salvadoris-photojournalism-behind-the-scenes/|title=Ruben Salvadori's Photojournalism Behind the Scenes|date=2012-02-24|work=NO CAPTION NEEDED|access-date=2017-04-19|language=en-US}}</ref>\n\nAnother notion circulating around the critique of objectivity is proposed by scholar [http://explore.georgetown.edu/people/JL537/ Judith Lichtenberg]. She points to the logical inconsistency that arises when scholars or journalists criticize journalism for failing to be objective, while simultaneously proposing that ''there is no such thing'' as objectivity.<ref name=\":1\" /> Underpinning critiques of objectivity that arose in the 1970s and 1980s, this dual theory - which Lichtenberg refers to as a \"compound assault on objectivity\"<ref name=\":5\">Lichtenberg, Judith (1991) \u2018In Defense of Objectivity\u2019, in James Curran and Michael Gurevitch (eds.), Mass Media and Society, London: Arnold.</ref> - invalidates itself, as each element of the argument repudiates the other.<ref name=\":1\" /> Lichtenberg agrees with other scholars that view objectivity as mere conventional practice: she states that \"much of what goes under the name of objectivity reflects shallow understanding of it\".<ref name=\":1\" /><ref name=\":5\" /> Thus, she suggests that these practices, rather than the overall notion of objectivity (whose primary aim, according to Lichtenberg, is only to seek and pursue truth), should really be the target of critique.<ref name=\":1\" /><ref name=\":5\" />\n\n==Alternatives==\nSome argue that a more appropriate standard should be [[Fairness Doctrine|fairness]] and [[accuracy]] (as enshrined in the names of groups like [[Fairness and Accuracy in Reporting]]). Under this standard, taking sides on an issue would be permitted as long as the side taken was accurate and the other side was given a fair chance to respond.  Many professionals believe that true objectivity in journalism is not possible and reporters must seek balance in their stories (giving all sides their respective points of view), which fosters fairness.\n\n{{rquote|right|A good reporter who is well-steeped in his subject matter and who isn\u2019t out to prove his cleverness, but rather is sweating out a detailed understanding of a topic worth exploring, will probably develop intelligent opinions that will inform and perhaps be expressed in his journalism.|[[Timothy Noah]], 1999<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.washingtonmonthly.com/features/1999/9901.symposium.noah.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304040258/http://www.washingtonmonthly.com/features/1999/9901.symposium.noah.html |title=Two imperatives in contemporary journalism |archive-date=2016-03-04}}</ref>}}\n\nBrent Cunningham suggests that reporters should understand their inevitable biases, so they can explore what the accepted narratives may be, and then work against these as much as possible.<ref name=\"cjr.org\" /> He points out that \u201c[w]e need deep reporting and real understanding, but we also need reporters to acknowledge all that they don\u2019t know, and not try to mask that shortcoming behind a gloss of attitude, or drown it in a roar of oversimplified assertions\u201d.<ref name=\"cjr.org\"/>\n\nCunningham suggests the following to solve the apparent controversies of objectivity:<ref name=\"cjr.org\" />  \n* Journalists should acknowledge, humbly and publicly, that what they do is far more subjective and far less detached than the aura of 'objectivity' implies. He proposes that this will not end the charges of bias, but rather allow journalists to defend what they do from a more realistic and less hypocritical position.\n* Journalists should be free and encouraged to develop expertise and to use it to sort through competing claims, identifying and explaining the underlying assumptions of those claims, and making judgments about what readers and viewers need to know and understand about what is happening. \nIn the words of another scholar, Faina (2012) suggests that modern journalists may function as \"sensemakers\" within the shifting contemporary journalistic environment.<ref name=\":6\">Faina, J.

The application of this \u201cempirical\u201d \u201cresearch\u201d to the reporting of conflict may thus replace the \u201cunacknowledged\u201d conventions (see above) which govern the \u201cnon-scientific\u201d practices of 'objectivity' of journalism.\n\n== Crowdfunding ==\nRecently, many scholars and journalists have increasingly become attuned to the shifts occurring within the newspaper industry, and general upheaval of the journalistic environment, as it adjusts to the new [[digital era]] of the 21st century.<ref name=\":7\">Hunter, Andrea (2014). \"Crowdfunding independent and freelance journalism: Negotiating journalistic norms of autonomy and objectivity\". ''new media & society''. Sage. 17 (2): 272\u2013288.</ref> In the face of this, the practice of [[crowdfunding]] is increasingly being utilized by journalists to fund independent and/or alternative projects,<ref name=\":7\" /> establishing it as another relevant alternative practice to consider in the discussion of journalistic objectivity. Crowdfunding allows journalists to pursue stories of interest to them or that otherwise may not be covered adequately for a number of reasons.<ref name=\":72\">Hunter, Andrea (2014). \"Crowdfunding independent and freelance journalism: Negotiating journalistic norms of autonomy and objectivity\". ''new media & society''. Sage. 17 (2): 272\u2013288.</ref> Crowdfunding supports journalists by funding necessary components like reporting equipment, computers, travel expenses if necessary, and overhead costs like office space or paying other staff on their team.<ref name=\":72\" /> A key component of crowdfunding and a significant motivator for journalists to use it is the lack of corporate backing.<ref name=\":72\" /> This means that the journalist has the autonomy to make editorial decisions at their sole discrection but there is equally no financial support.\n\nAccording to a study conducted by Hunter (2014), journalist's engaged in a crowdfunding campaign all held a similar opinion that their funders did not have control over the content and that it was the journalist who maintained ultimate jurisdiction.<ref name=\":7\" /> However, this pronouncement was complicated by the sense of accountability or responsibility incited in journalists towards their funders.<ref name=\":7\" /> Hunter (2014) notes that this may have the effect of creating a power imbalance between funders and the journalist, as journalists want to maintain editorial control, but it is in fact the funders that decide whether the project will be a success or not.<ref name=\":7\" />\n\nTo combat this, Hunter (2014) proposes the following strategies that journalists may employ to maintain a more objective approach if desired:<ref name=\":7\" />\n\n* Constructing an imaginary 'firewall' between themselves and their audiences\n* Limiting investment from any single source \n* Clearly defining the relationship they desire with funders at the outset of the project\n\nThe type of relationship and potential pressures the journalist may feel depends on the type of investor with whom they are working, as there are passive and active investors. Passive investors will not be involved beyond making a donation on the crowdfunding platform, leaving everything up to the discretion of the journalist.<ref name=\":7\" />  In contrast, active investors have a more active role in the production of the journalistic piece, which can take various forms that may include the investor providing feedback or ideas as well as receiving early copies of the work prior to its public release.<ref name=\":7\" />\n\nSome journalists from the study firmly held the opinion that impartial accounts and a detached, namely \"objective\", reporting style should continue to govern, even within a crowdfunding context.<ref name=\":7\" /> Others, however, advocated that [[Point of view (philosophy)|point-of-view]] journalism and accurate reporting are not [[Mutual exclusivity|mutually exclusive]] ideals, and thus journalists still may ascribe to quality factual reporting, sans the traditional practices or understanding of objectivity.<ref name=\":7\" />\n\nAs mentioned at the top of the article, objectivity is a centuries long practice associated with what is considered professional journalism. However, crowdfunding shows that there is a great deal of interest and support for jounralism with a strong point of view. The study on crowdfunding done by Hunter (2014) showed that audiences are keen to fund projects with a specific point of view or pieces of advocacy journalism.<ref name=\":7\" /> Journalists are often using crowdfunding to pursue stories with a point-of-view that large corporations do not pursue adequately.<ref name=\":7\" /> The journalist explains the goal of the work they are trying to pursue and what resources are needed for it on crowdfunding platforms. Based on this information, funders decide to contribute or not.<ref name=\":7\" /> The desire or acceptance of opinionated journalism is especially clear with passive investors because they donate based on the journalist's pitch and let the journalist produce what they want. They essentially just want to support the journalist as an individual and allow them the freedom to pursue the project.\n\n== See also ==\n{{div col|colwidth=30em}}\n*[[Advocacy journalism]]\n*[[Access journalism]]\n*[[Corporate media]]\n*[[Journalistic professionalism]]\n*[[Media bias]]\n*[[Peace Journalism]]\n*[[Crowdfunding]]\n*[[War correspondent]]\n{{div col end}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|colwidth=30em}}\n\n==Sources==\n* Kaplan, Richard.  2002.

Some believe that objectivity becomes meaningless because it is impossible from journalists to achieve truthfulness, fairness, and detachment to the fullest extent because it rests on the observation that 'journalists are human beings\"-- meaning that they have a gender, ethnicity, family, a social background, personal history, this all meaning that when a journalist believes they can put all of these factors aside they fail to see how their own conscious and unconscious motivations are affecting how they report. It is also critiqued because as journalism has expanded any basically anyone can be a self-proclaimed journalist, not all of the same rules are in place for those who are professionals or those who have a small blog. To further that, journalistic writing is seen as a discipline rather than just a personal platform for ideas and opinions. The lines begin to become blurred, but they can only be meaningful when they support the wider project of objectivity: which is an open-ended pursuit of truth. If, on the other hand, the norms of professional journalistic practice become hardened into a strict set of rules, then journalism is just a discipline reduced to meaningless habits[[User:Taylorbruce23|Taylorbruce23]] ([[User talk:Taylorbruce23|talk]]) 02:48, 16 April 2020 (UTC)\n\nthe rise and fall of objectivity \n\nThe rise of objectivity has many layers of how it came to be, and it was most prominent throughout history when reporting on wars were at the forefront of journalism. The establishment of objectivity as a clear professional ethic of journalism after the First World War went hand in hand with a joint and conscious effort to \u2018manage\u2019 a dangerous public opinion. And during these times news platforms like the BBC were presented with the opportunity of \u201cimpartiality\u201d The explicit promotion of journalistic objectivity was an attempt to cope with this situation by finding ways to retain credibility with the mass audience. It was also a tool for managing public opinion: the rise of public relations in the inter-war period indicated the elite\u2019s pressing concern with handling an unruly and unpredictable mass public by \u2018engineering\u2019 or \u2018manufacturing\u2019 consent as stated by Edward Bernays and Walter Lippmann the fall of objectivity The traditional professional routines of journalism were potentially more than mere \u2018rituals\u2019: practices such as fact-checking or seeking out both sides of a story offered ways to overcome the limitations of one\u2019s own subjective impressions and to get at the truth. Today, there is less sense of a necessity to transcend the personal and impressionistic.\n\nIt is often suggested that traditional forms of journalism have been undermined by the wide availability of access to journalism, as masses of amateurs with camera phones and laptops present a variety of perspectives directly to the public that the formerly authoritative discourse of the professional reporter is reduced to merely one voice among many. But it could just as plausibly be argued that \u2013 at least potentially \u2013 new technologies could help to overcome many of the obstacles to objective journalism.[[User:Taylorbruce23|Taylorbruce23]] ([[User talk:Taylorbruce23|talk]]) 02:48, 16 April 2020 (UTC) \n\n# '''[[User talk:Taylorbruce23/sandbox#cite%20ref-1|^]]''' Calcutt, Andrew, and Philip Hammond.

Journalistic [[objectivity (philosophy)|objectivity]] may refer to [[social justice|fairness]], [[impartiality|disinterestedness]], [[fact]]uality, and [[partisan (political)|nonpartisanship]], but most often encompasses all of these qualities. First evolving as a practice in the 18th century, a number of critiques and alternatives to the notion have emerged since, fuelling ongoing and dynamic [[discourse]]<nowiki> surrounding the ideal of objectivity in journalism. {{</nowiki>'''Citation needed'''<nowiki>}}</nowiki>\n\nMost newspapers and TV stations depend upon [[news agencies]] for their material, and each of the four major global agencies ([[Agence France-Presse]] (formerly the Havas agency), [[Associated Press]], [[Reuters]], and [[Agencia EFE]]) began with and continue to operate on a basic philosophy of providing a single objective news feed to all subscribers. That is, they do not provide separate feeds for conservative or liberal newspapers.  Journalist [[Jonathan Fenby]] has explained  the notion:\n\n<blockquote>To achieve such wide acceptability, the agencies avoid overt partiality.  Demonstrably correct information is their stock-in-trade.  Traditionally, they report at a reduced level of responsibility, attributing their information to a spokesman, the press, or other sources.  They avoid making judgments and steer clear of doubt and ambiguity.  Though their founders did not use the word, objectivity is the philosophical basis for their enterprises \u2013 or failing that, widely acceptable [[Neutrality (philosophy)|neutrality]].<ref>Jonathan Fenby, ''The International News Services'' (1986) p. 25</ref></blockquote>\n\nObjectivity in journalism aims to help the audience make up their own mind about a story, providing the facts alone and then letting audiences interpret those on their own. To maintain objectivity in journalism, journalists should present the facts whether or not they like or agree with those facts. Objective reporting is meant to portray issues and events in a neutral and unbiased manner, regardless of the writer's opinion or personal beliefs.<ref name=\":0\">Clark, Roy Peter.

The journalist must report only the facts and not a personal attitude toward the facts.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=bAP5MOcnH8EC&pg=PA203|title=Discovering Journalism|publisher=Greenwood|year=1999|page=203|author=Warren G. Bov\u00e9e}}</ref> While objectivity is a complex and dynamic notion that may refer to a multitude of techniques and practices, it generally refers to the idea of \"three distinct, yet interrelated, concepts\": truthfulness, [[Neutrality (philosophy)|neutrality]], and detachment.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\nTruthfulness is a commitment to reporting only accurate and truthful information, without skewing any facts or details to improve the story or better align an issue with any certain agenda.<ref name=\":1\" /> Neutrality suggests that stories be reported in an unbiased, even-handed, and impartial manner. Under this notion, journalists are to side with none of the parties involved, and simply provide the relevant facts and information of all.<ref name=\":1\" /> The third idea, detachment, refers to the emotional approach of the journalist. Essentially, reporters should not only approach issues in an unbiased manner but also with a dispassionate and emotionless attitude. Through this strategy, stories can be presented in a rational and calm manner, letting the audience make up their minds without any influences from the media.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\nHistorically, journalism as a profession comes with objectivity. However, journalism objectivity has been challenged by many scholars and criticizing  journalistic objectivity. They argue that objectivity is supposed to be promoting truth and defined as a \u2018correspondence, grounded incorrectness, between thought and reality\u2019 (Heidegger, 1943:1). But  journalism is a bit off track nowadays.\n\n==History==\nThe modern notion of objectivity in journalism is largely due to the work of [[Walter Lippmann]].<ref>[https://www.americanpressinstitute.org/journalism-essentials/bias-objectivity/lost-meaning-objectivity/ The lost meaning of \u2018objectivity\u2019]</ref>  Lippmann was the first to widely call for journalists to use the scientific method for gathering information.<ref>[http://www.nordicom.gu.se/sites/default/files/kapitel-pdf/222_wien.pdf Defining Objectivity within Journalism], [[University of Gothenburg]]</ref> Lippmann called for journalistic objectivity after the excesses of [[yellow journalism]].  He noted that the yellows at the time had served their purpose, but that the people needed to receive the actual news, and not a \"romanticized version of it\".<ref>[https://archive.org/details/KSULKSInd193031V57N1733 Kansas industrialist]. p. 6</ref>\n\nThe term ''objectivity'' was not applied to journalistic work until the 20th century, but it had fully emerged as a guiding principle by the 1890s. Michael Schudson,<ref>[http://www.journalism.columbia.edu/profile/62-michael-schudson/10 Michael Schudson's faculty page] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160405061527/http://www.journalism.columbia.edu/profile/62-michael-schudson/10 |date=2016-04-05 }}; Columbia Journalism School, accessed 20 December 2012</ref> among a number of other communication scholars and historians, agree that the idea of objectivity has prevailed in dominant discourse among journalists in the United States since the appearance of modern newspapers in the [[Jacksonian democracy|Jacksonian Era]] of the 1830s. These papers transformed the press amidst the democratization of politics, the expansion of a market economy, and the growing authority of an entrepreneurial, urban middle class. Before then, American newspapers were expected to present a partisan viewpoint, not a neutral one.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=uLois7_nNMgC&printsec=frontcover&dq=inauthor:%22Michael+Schudson%22&hl=da&ei=7tZHT8m-CIOngwePioX2DQ&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=book-thumbnail&resnum=1&ved=0CDMQ6wEwAA#v=onepage&q=inauthor%3A%22Michael%20Schudson%22&f=false|title=Discovering the News|last=Schudson|first=Michael|year=1978|pages=4}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.mediaethicsmagazine.com/index.php/browse-back-issues/179-fall-2013-vol-25-no-1/3999003-objectivity-and-advocacy-in-journalism|title=Objectivity and Advocacy in Journalism - mediaethicsmagazine.com|website=www.mediaethicsmagazine.com|language=en-gb|access-date=2017-04-19}}</ref>\n\nThe need for objectivity first occurred to Associated Press editors who realize that partisanship would narrow their potential market. Their goal was to reach all newspapers, and leave it to the individual papers to decide on what slanting and commentary were needed.  Lawrence Gobright, the AP chief in Washington, explained the philosophy of objectivity to Congress in 1856:\n\n<blockquote>My business is to communicate facts.  My instructions do not allow me to make any comments upon the facts which I communicate.  My dispatches are sent to papers of all manner of politics, and the editors say they are able to make their own comments upon the facts which are sent to them.  I, therefore confine myself to what I consider legitimate news.  I do not act as a politician belonging to any school, but try to be truthful and impartial.  My dispatches are merely dry matter of fact and detail.<ref>Richard Schwarzlose, ''Nation's Newsbrokers Volume 1: The Formative Years: From Pretelegraph to 1865'' (1989) p. 179</ref><ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8_Q283mkIIkC&pg=PA81|title=Covering America: A Narrative History of a Nation's Journalism|publisher=Univ of Massachusetts Press|year=2012|page=81|author=Christopher B. Daly}}</ref></blockquote>\n\nBut into the first decade of the twentieth century, it was uncommon to see a sharp divide between facts and values. However, during [[World War I]], scholar Stuart Allan (1997) suggests that propaganda campaigns, as well the rise of \"press agents and publicity experts\", fostered the growing cynicism among the public towards state institutions and \"official channels of information\".<ref name=\":1\" /> The elevation of objectivity thus constituted as an effort to re-legitimatize the news-press, as well as the state in general.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\nSome historians, like Gerald Baldasty, have observed that objectivity went hand in hand with the need to make profits in the newspaper business by attracting advertisers. In this economic analysis, publishers did not want to offend any potential advertising clients and therefore encouraged news editors and reporters to strive to present all sides of an issue. Advertisers would remind the press that partisanship hurts circulation, and, consequently, advertising revenues - thus, objectivity was sought.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=sKExQuza2EUC&pg=PA29&lpg=PA29&dq=Gerald+Baldasty+the+rise+of+objectivity#v=onepage&q=Gerald%20Baldasty%20the%20rise%20of%20objectivity&f=false|title=Advertising and a Democratic Press|last=Baker|first=Edwin C.|year=1994|pages=29}}</ref>\n\nOthers have proposed a political explanation for the rise of objectivity; scholars like Richard Kaplan have argued that political parties needed to lose their hold over the loyalties of voters and the institutions of government before the press could feel free to offer a nonpartisan, \"impartial\" account of news events.<ref name=\":2\" /> This change occurred following the critical [[1896 United States presidential election|1896 election]] and the subsequent reform of the [[Progressive Era]].<ref name=\":2\">{{cite book|title=Politics and the American Press: The Rise of Objectivity, 1865\u20131920|last=Kaplan|first=Richard L.|year=2002}}</ref>\n\nLater, during the period following [[World War II]], the newly formalized rules and practices of objectivity led to a brief national consensus and temporary suspension of negative public opinion;<ref name=\":1\" /> however, doubts and uncertainties in \"the institutions of [[democracy]] and [[capitalism]]\" resurfaced in the period of civil unrest during the 1960s and 1970s, ultimately leading to the emergence of the ''critique'' of objectivity.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\nIn conclusion, there are three key factors in the origin of objectivity. The transition from a political model of journalism to a commercial model requires the production of content that can be marketed across the political and ideological spectrum. The telegraph imposes pressures on journalists to prioritize the most important facts at the beginning of the story and adopt a simplified, homogenized and generic style that could appeal to geographically diverse audiences. In the early 20th century, journalism started to define itself as a professional occupation that required special training, unique skills and self-regulation according to ethical principles (Professionalization normalized the regime of objectivity as the foundation of good journalism, providing benefits to journalists and editors/publishers.\n\n== Criticisms ==\n{{See also|View from nowhere}}\n[[File:Megan Willams -Objectivity does not exist (not even for jurnalists).webm|thumb|left|Megan Willams (journalist), ...''Objectivity does not exist (especially for journalists)...'' interviewed in [[Varanasi]] in December 2010 by Vrinda Dar]]\n\nSome scholars and journalists criticize the understanding of objectivity as neutrality or nonpartisanship, arguing that it does a disservice to the public because it fails to attempt to find truth.<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite book|title=Journalism Studies: A Critical Introduction |last=Calcutt |first=Andrew |last2=Hammond |first2=Phillip |publisher=Routledge |year=2011 |isbn=0-203-83174-8 |location=USA & Canada|pages=97\u2013114}}</ref> They also argue that such objectivity is nearly impossible to apply in practice\u2014newspapers inevitably take a point of view in deciding what stories to cover, which to feature on the front page, and what sources they quote.<ref name=\":1\" /> The media critics [[Edward S. Herman]] and [[Noam Chomsky]] have advanced a [[propaganda model]] hypothesis proposing that such a notion of objectivity results in heavily favoring government viewpoints and large corporations.<ref name=\":1\" /> Mainstream commentators accept that [[news value]] drives selection of stories, but there is some debate as to whether catering to an audience's level of interest in a story makes the selection process non-objective.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\nAnother example of an objection to objectivity, according to communication scholar [[David Mindich]], was the coverage that the major papers (most notably the ''[[New York Times]]'') gave to the [[lynching]] of thousands of African Americans during the 1890s.<ref name=\":4\" /> News stories of the period described the hanging, immolation and mutilation of people by mobs with detachment and, through the regimen of objectivity, news writers often attempted to construct a \"[[false balance]]\" of these accounts by recounting the alleged transgressions of the victims that provoked the lynch mobs to fury.<ref name=\":4\">{{Cite book|title=African American Journalists: Autobiography as Memoir and Manifesto|last=Hall|first=Calvin|publisher=Scarecrow Press|year=2009|isbn=978-0-8108-6931-8|location=USA|pages=8}}</ref> Mindich suggests that by enabling practices of objectivity and allowing them to \"[go] basically unquestioned\",<ref name=\":4\" /> it may have had the effect of normalizing the practice of lynching.<ref>''Just the Facts: How \"Objectivity\" Came to Define American Journalism'', 1998</ref>\n\nIn a more recent example, scholars Andrew Calcutt and Phillip Hammond (2011) note that since the 1990s, war reporting (especially) has increasingly come to criticize and reject the practice of objectivity.<ref name=\":1\" /> In 1998, a [[BBC News|BBC]] reporter, [[Martin Bell]], noted that he favoured a \"journalism of attachment\", over the previously sought after dispassionate approach.<ref name=\":1\" /><ref>Bell, Martin (1998) \u2018The Journalism of Attachment\u2019, in Matthew Kieran (ed.), Media Ethics, London and New York, NY: Routledge.</ref> Similarly, a [[CNN]] [[war correspondent]] from the US, [[Christiane Amanpour]], stated that in some circumstances \"neutrality can mean you are an accomplice to all sorts of evil\".<ref>Ricchiardi, Sherry (1996) \u2018Over the Line?\u2019, American Journalism Review, 18 (September): 24\u201331.</ref><ref name=\":1\" /> Each of these opinions stems from scholar's and journalist's critique of objectivity as too \"heartless\" or \"forensic\" to report the human natured and emotionally charged issues found in war and conflict reporting.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\nAs discussed above, with the growth of mass media, especially from the 19th century, news advertising became the most important source of media revenue. Whole audiences needed to be engaged across communities and regions to maximize advertising revenue. This led to \"[j]ournalistic [o]bjectivity as an industry standard [\u2026] a set of conventions allowing the news to be presented as all things to all people\".<ref name=\":3\">Lynch, J. & McGoldrick, A. (2005). ''Peace Journalism''. Gloucestershire: Hawthorn Press, p. 203</ref> In modern journalism, especially with the emergence of 24-hour news cycles, speed is of the essence in responding to breaking stories. It is therefore not possible for reporters to decide \"from first principles\" how they will report each and every story that presents itself - thus, some scholars argue that mere convention (versus a true devotion to truth-seeking) has come to govern much of journalism.<ref name=\":3\" />\n\n{{rquote|right|Reporters are biased toward conflict because it is more interesting than stories without conflict; we are biased toward sticking with the pack because it is safe; we are biased toward event-driven coverage because it is easier; we are biased toward existing narratives because they are safe and easy.

He suggests that objectivity makes us passive recipients of news, rather than aggressive analyzers and critics of it.<ref name=\"cjr.org\" /> According to Cunningham, the nut of the tortured relationship with objectivity lies within a number of conflicting diktats that the press was subjected to operate under: be neutral yet investigative; be disengaged yet have an impact; and be fair-minded yet have an edge.<ref name=\"cjr.org\" /> Cunningham, however, argues that reporters by and large are not ideological warriors; rather, they are imperfect people performing a difficult job that is crucial to society and, \"[d]espite all our important and necessary attempts to minimize [individual's] humanity, it can't be any other way,\" Cunningham concludes.<ref name=\"cjr.org\" />\n\nThe debate about objectivity is lit also within the photojournalism field. In 2011, Italian photographer [[Ruben Salvadori]] challenged the expectation of objective truth that the general public associates to photojournalism with his project \"Photojournalism Behind the Scenes\".<ref>{{cite news|title=Hinter den Kulissen des Fotojournalismus|url=http://www.zeit.de/politik/ausland/2012-03/fs-ruben-salvadori-2|newspaper=Die Zeit}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=CBC / Radio Canada - Les Lionnes|url=http://vimeo.com/36256731}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|title=Dietro le Quinte|url=http://www.internazionale.it/portfolio/dietro-le-quinte/|newspaper=Internazionale}}</ref> By including the traditionally invisible photographer into the frame, Salvadori sought to ignite a discussion about the ethics of the profession, and indicate a need for audiences to be  active viewers who understand and recognize the potential subjectivity of the photographic medium.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.nocaptionneeded.com/2012/02/ruben-salvadoris-photojournalism-behind-the-scenes/|title=Ruben Salvadori's Photojournalism Behind the Scenes|date=2012-02-24|work=NO CAPTION NEEDED|access-date=2017-04-19|language=en-US}}</ref>\n\nAnother notion circulating around the critique of objectivity is proposed by scholar [http://explore.georgetown.edu/people/JL537/ Judith Lichtenberg]. She points to the logical inconsistency that arises when scholars or journalists criticize journalism for failing to be objective, while simultaneously proposing that ''there is no such thing'' as objectivity.<ref name=\":1\" /> Underpinning critiques of objectivity that arose in the 1970s and 1980s, this dual theory - which Lichtenberg refers to as a \"compound assault on objectivity\"<ref name=\":5\">Lichtenberg, Judith (1991) \u2018In Defense of Objectivity\u2019, in James Curran and Michael Gurevitch (eds.), Mass Media and Society, London: Arnold.</ref> - invalidates itself, as each element of the argument repudiates the other.<ref name=\":1\" /> Lichtenberg agrees with other scholars that view objectivity as mere conventional practice: she states that \"much of what goes under the name of objectivity reflects shallow understanding of it\".<ref name=\":1\" /><ref name=\":5\" /> Thus, she suggests that these practices, rather than the overall notion of objectivity (whose primary aim, according to Lichtenberg, is only to seek and pursue truth), should really be the target of critique.<ref name=\":1\" /><ref name=\":5\" />\n\n==Alternatives==\nSome argue that a more appropriate standard should be [[Fairness Doctrine|fairness]] and [[accuracy]] (as enshrined in the names of groups like [[Fairness and Accuracy in Reporting]]). Under this standard, taking sides on an issue would be permitted as long as the side taken was accurate and the other side was given a fair chance to respond.  Many professionals believe that true objectivity in journalism is not possible and reporters must seek balance in their stories (giving all sides their respective points of view), which fosters fairness.\n\n{{rquote|right|A good reporter who is well-steeped in his subject matter and who isn\u2019t out to prove his cleverness, but rather is sweating out a detailed understanding of a topic worth exploring, will probably develop intelligent opinions that will inform and perhaps be expressed in his journalism.|[[Timothy Noah]], 1999<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.washingtonmonthly.com/features/1999/9901.symposium.noah.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304040258/http://www.washingtonmonthly.com/features/1999/9901.symposium.noah.html |title=Two imperatives in contemporary journalism |archive-date=2016-03-04}}</ref>}}\n\nBrent Cunningham suggests that reporters should understand their inevitable biases, so they can explore what the accepted narratives may be, and then work against these as much as possible.<ref name=\"cjr.org\" /> He points out that \u201c[w]e need deep reporting and real understanding, but we also need reporters to acknowledge all that they don\u2019t know, and not try to mask that shortcoming behind a gloss of attitude, or drown it in a roar of oversimplified assertions\u201d.<ref name=\"cjr.org\"/>\n\nCunningham suggests the following to solve the apparent controversies of objectivity:<ref name=\"cjr.org\" />  \n* Journalists should acknowledge, humbly and publicly, that what they do is far more subjective and far less detached than the aura of 'objectivity' implies.

The application of this \u201cempirical\u201d \u201cresearch\u201d to the reporting of conflict may thus replace the \u201cunacknowledged\u201d conventions (see above) which govern the \u201cnon-scientific\u201d practices of 'objectivity' of journalism.\n\n== Crowdfunding ==\nRecently, many scholars and journalists have increasingly become attuned to the shifts occurring within the newspaper industry, and general upheaval of the journalistic environment, as it adjusts to the new [[digital era]] of the 21st century.<ref name=\":7\">Hunter, Andrea (2014). \"Crowdfunding independent and freelance journalism: Negotiating journalistic norms of autonomy and objectivity\". ''new media & society''. Sage. 17 (2): 272\u2013288.</ref> In the face of this, the practice of [[crowdfunding]] is increasingly being utilized by journalists to fund independent and/or alternative projects,<ref name=\":7\" /> establishing it as another relevant alternative practice to consider in the discussion of journalistic objectivity. Crowdfunding allows journalists to pursue stories of interest to them or that otherwise may not be covered adequately for a number of reasons.<ref name=\":72\">Hunter, Andrea (2014). \"Crowdfunding independent and freelance journalism: Negotiating journalistic norms of autonomy and objectivity\". ''new media & society''. Sage. 17 (2): 272\u2013288.</ref> Crowdfunding supports journalists by funding necessary components like reporting equipment, computers, travel expenses if necessary, and overhead costs like office space or paying other staff on their team.<ref name=\":72\" /> A key component of crowdfunding and a significant motivator for journalists to use it is the lack of corporate backing.<ref name=\":72\" /> This means that the journalist has the autonomy to make editorial decisions at their sole discrection but there is equally no financial support.\n\nAccording to a study conducted by Hunter (2014), journalist's engaged in a crowdfunding campaign all held a similar opinion that their funders did not have control over the content and that it was the journalist who maintained ultimate jurisdiction.<ref name=\":7\" /> However, this pronouncement was complicated by the sense of accountability or responsibility incited in journalists towards their funders.<ref name=\":7\" /> Hunter (2014) notes that this may have the effect of creating a power imbalance between funders and the journalist, as journalists want to maintain editorial control, but it is in fact the funders that decide whether the project will be a success or not.<ref name=\":7\" />\n\nTo combat this, Hunter (2014) proposes the following strategies that journalists may employ to maintain a more objective approach if desired:<ref name=\":7\" />\n\n* Constructing an imaginary 'firewall' between themselves and their audiences\n* Limiting investment from any single source \n* Clearly defining the relationship they desire with funders at the outset of the project\n\nThe type of relationship and potential pressures the journalist may feel depends on the type of investor with whom they are working, as there are passive and active investors. Passive investors will not be involved beyond making a donation on the crowdfunding platform, leaving everything up to the discretion of the journalist.<ref name=\":7\" />  In contrast, active investors have a more active role in the production of the journalistic piece, which can take various forms that may include the investor providing feedback or ideas as well as receiving early copies of the work prior to its public release.<ref name=\":7\" />\n\nSome journalists from the study firmly held the opinion that impartial accounts and a detached, namely \"objective\", reporting style should continue to govern, even within a crowdfunding context.<ref name=\":7\" /> Others, however, advocated that [[Point of view (philosophy)|point-of-view]] journalism and accurate reporting are not [[Mutual exclusivity|mutually exclusive]] ideals, and thus journalists still may ascribe to quality factual reporting, sans the traditional practices or understanding of objectivity.<ref name=\":7\" />\n\nAs mentioned at the top of the article, objectivity is a centuries long practice associated with what is considered professional journalism. However, crowdfunding shows that there is a great deal of interest and support for jounralism with a strong point of view. The study on crowdfunding done by Hunter (2014) showed that audiences are keen to fund projects with a specific point of view or pieces of advocacy journalism.<ref name=\":7\" /> Journalists are often using crowdfunding to pursue stories with a point-of-view that large corporations do not pursue adequately.<ref name=\":7\" /> The journalist explains the goal of the work they are trying to pursue and what resources are needed for it on crowdfunding platforms. Based on this information, funders decide to contribute or not.<ref name=\":7\" /> The desire or acceptance of opinionated journalism is especially clear with passive investors because they donate based on the journalist's pitch and let the journalist produce what they want. They essentially just want to support the journalist as an individual and allow them the freedom to pursue the project.\n\n== See also ==\n{{div col|colwidth=30em}}\n*[[Advocacy journalism]]\n*[[Access journalism]]\n*[[Corporate media]]\n*[[Journalistic professionalism]]\n*[[Media bias]]\n*[[Peace Journalism]]\n*[[Crowdfunding]]\n*[[War correspondent]]\n{{div col end}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|colwidth=30em}}\n\n==Sources==\n* Kaplan, Richard.  2002.

''BSE'' was an [[Open-ended (gameplay)|open-ended]] \"space opera\" with a single available game that began in playtesting in 1981.<ref name=Marte6/> According to Stephen Marte, like \"[[The Tribes of Crane|Tribes of Crane]] and [[Midgard (game)|Midgard]], BSE is the stomping ground of many of PBM's best power gamers\".<ref>[[#Mar87|Marte 1987]]. p. 6., Marte bolded Tribes of Crane, Midgard, and BSE in the original text.</ref> The game comprised two variants, one monitored by Game Masters who imposed artificial constraints, and another without constraints. Gameplay took place on a vast space stage where [[mega-corporation]]s formed the dominant organizing framework, alongside various other groups that players could join to pursue tasks to advance, collaborate with other players, and progress to more senior positions such as colony governors. ''Beyond the Stellar Empire'' placed #5 and #11 in 1987 and 1988, respectively, in ''[[Paper Mayhem]]'', a magazine for play-by-mail games, for Best PBM Game of the Year. In subsequent years, the game did not score well in ''Paper Mayhem'' reader ratings for playability, use, and product understanding. ''Beyond the Stellar Empire: The New System'' won the [[Origins Award]] for Best New Play-By-Mail Game of 1989.\n\n==Development==\nReviewer Stephen Marte stated in 1987 that he had contact information for 150 PBM players but speculated that as many as 450 actually played the game.<ref>[[#Mui13|Muir 2013]]. p. 14.</ref>\n\nIn the January/February 1990 issue of ''[[Paper Mayhem]]'', a magazine for [[Play-by-mail game|play-by-mail games]], Mike Popolizio, Liz Leblanc, and Marti Popolizio described a redesign conducted on ''BSE''.<ref name=Poplizio>[[#Pop90|Popolizio, Leblanc, and Popolizio1990]]. p. 8\u201310.</ref> The overhaul included faster turnaround times for turns, additional options for diplomacy, increased ability to implement player suggestions, introduction of black-markets, and other changes.<ref name=Poplizio/> \n\nIn a 1992 issue of ''Paper Mayhem'', Wayne Alexander identified two variants of ''Beyond the Stellar Empire'': the Capellan Periphery and the Draconian Variant.<ref name=Alex31>[[#Ale92|Alexander 1992]]. p. 31.</ref> Alexander noted that the Capellan Periphery was the initial variant and was open-ended in the sense that it had no victory conditions\u2013players could continue to progress through work and expenditures, requesting and completing assignments, acquiring larger ships and colonies, etc.<ref name=Alex31/> However, he lamented that the Capellan Periphery was not truly open-ended in that the Game Masters (GMs) eventually would impose an artificial constraint on play that he called \"The Wall\".<ref name=Alex31/> This didn't prevent the players from having an enjoyable playing experience, but it limited \"power players\".<ref name=Alex31/> In other words, according to Alexander, \"The Capellan Periphery has a lot of sizzle, but the steak is just dog meat.\"<ref name=Alex31/> The Draconian Variant, while nascent in 1992, and saddled with some minor gameplay challenges, put players on the \"ground floor\" of a truly open-ended game, causing Alexander to describe it as one \"with very little sizzle at this point, but the steak is filet mignon in potential\".<ref name=Alex31/>\n\n==Gameplay==\nThe game took place on a vast space stage. Stephen Marte stated the following about the field of play in 1987: <blockquote>The playing field consists of 80 systems. Each system is 30X30 hexes and each hex is 46,000 square miles. Five hundred planets, moons, and gas giants have been found in the 52 systems of the Capellan Periphery and it is estimated there are another 500 worlds in the 38 systems of the less explored Transhole Region. Planets and moons may be mapped, scanned, and geologically proved down to a 10 square mile sector. For all intents and purposes the scope of the playing field is as large as your imagination.<ref name=Marte6>[[#Mar87|Marte 1987]]. p. 6.</ref></blockquote>\n\nThe central element of the game was its thirteen [[mega-corporation]]s.<ref name=Marte6/> Most of these were directed by a Game Master employed by Adventures by Mail, but run by a board of coordinators made up of players which managed a large hierarchy of players.<ref name=Marte6/> These corporations provided frameworks that enabled players to choose, pursue, and accomplish tasks, but also generated interesting competition dynamics between corporations as well as internal competition struggles that sometimes caused cleavages serious enough to cause banishments or voluntary departures.<ref name=Marte6/> Players did not have to join a mega-corporation: other possible groups included \"seven alien races, a religious sect, and a small piratical band know[n] as the Raiders of the Imperial Periphery (RIP)\".<ref name=Marte6/>\n\nPlayers were limited to two starcaptains at the outset, but had significant variety among the 16 ship types and great room for game progression.<ref name=Marte6/> For example, by 1987, there were 250 players acting as colony governors of varying sizes.<ref name=Marte6/> Powerful players in mature roles could shift to a research focus to keep gameplay from getting stale.<ref name=Marte6/>\n\n==Reception and Legacy==\nReviewer Stephen Marte observed in 1987 that ''Beyond the Stellar Empire'' was in some ways \"the \"ultimate PBM game\".<ref name=Marte6/> In the November/December 1987 issue of ''Paper Mayhem'', ''Beyond the Stellar Empire'' tied for the #5 spot on the list of Best PBM Games of 1987 with [[Beyond the Quadra Zone (play-by-mail game)|''Beyond the Quadra Zone'']].<ref>[[#Maa87|Paper Mayhem 1987]]. p. 2.</ref> In 1988, the game tied for 11th place in the list of Best PBM Games of 1988 along with [[Rimworlds (play-by-mail game)|''Rimworlds'']].<ref>[[#Maa88|Paper Mayhem 1988]]. p. 2.</ref> However, the game did not perform well in reader ratings in ''Paper Mayhem'' during the following years.
