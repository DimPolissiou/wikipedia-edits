It is a silvery-grey [[metal]] in the [[actinide]] series of the [[periodic table]]. A uranium atom has 92 [[proton]]s and 92 [[electron]]s, of which 6 are [[valence electron]]s. Uranium is weakly [[radioactive decay|radioactive]] because all [[isotopes of uranium]] are unstable; the [[half-lives]] of its naturally occurring isotopes range between 159,200 years and 4.5 billion years. The most common isotopes in [[natural uranium]] are [[uranium-238]] (which has 146 [[neutron]]s and accounts for over 99% of uranium on Earth) and [[uranium-235]] (which has 143 neutrons). Uranium has the highest [[atomic weight]] of the [[primordial nuclide|primordially]] occurring elements. Its [[density]] is about 70% higher than that of [[lead]], and slightly lower than that of [[gold]] or [[tungsten]]. It occurs naturally in low concentrations of a few [[Parts-per notation#Parts-per expressions|parts per million]] in soil, rock and water, and is commercially [[uranium mining|extracted]] from uranium-bearing [[mineral]]s such as [[uraninite]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Uranium|url=https://www.britannica.com/science/uranium|website=Encyclopaedia Britannica|accessdate= 22 April 2017}}</ref>\n\nIn nature, uranium is found as uranium-238 (99.2739\u201399.2752%), uranium-235 (0.7198\u20130.7202%), and a very small amount of [[uranium-234]] (0.0050\u20130.0059%).<ref>{{cite Q|Q91488549}}</ref> Uranium decays slowly by emitting an [[alpha particle]].

Uranium-235 is the only naturally occurring [[fissile]] [[isotope]], which makes it widely used in [[nuclear power plant]]s and [[nuclear weapon]]s. However, because of the tiny amounts found in nature, uranium needs to undergo [[uranium enrichment|enrichment]] so that enough uranium-235 is present. Uranium-238 is fissionable by fast neutrons, and is [[fertile material|fertile]], meaning it can be [[Nuclear transmutation|transmuted]] to fissile [[plutonium-239]] in a [[nuclear reactor]]. Another fissile isotope, [[uranium-233]], can be produced from natural [[thorium]] and is also important in nuclear technology. Uranium-238 has a small probability for [[spontaneous fission]] or even induced fission with fast neutrons; uranium-235 and to a lesser degree uranium-233 have a much higher fission cross-section for slow neutrons. In sufficient concentration, these isotopes maintain a sustained [[nuclear chain reaction]]. This generates the heat in nuclear power reactors, and produces the fissile material for nuclear weapons. [[Depleted uranium]] (<sup>238</sup>U) is used in [[kinetic energy penetrator]]s and [[vehicle armour|armor plating]].<ref name=\"BuildingBlocks479\">{{Harvnb|Emsley|2001|p=479}}.</ref> Uranium is used as a colorant in [[uranium glass]], producing lemon yellow to green colors. Uranium glass fluoresces green in ultraviolet light. It was also used for tinting and shading in early [[photography]].\n\nThe 1789 [[discovery of the chemical elements|discovery]] of uranium in the mineral [[uraninite|pitchblende]] is credited to [[Martin Heinrich Klaproth]], who named the new element after the recently discovered planet [[Uranus]]. [[Eug\u00e8ne-Melchior P\u00e9ligot]] was the first person to isolate the metal and its radioactive properties were discovered in 1896 by [[Henri Becquerel]]. Research by [[Otto Hahn]], [[Lise Meitner]], [[Enrico Fermi]] and others, such as [[J. Robert Oppenheimer]] starting in 1934 led to its use as a fuel in the nuclear power industry and in ''[[Little Boy]]'', the [[Atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki|first nuclear weapon used in war]]. An ensuing [[arms race]] during the [[Cold War]] between the [[United States]] and the [[Soviet Union]] produced tens of thousands of nuclear weapons that used uranium metal and uranium-derived [[plutonium-239]]. The security of those weapons and their fissile material following the [[Collapse of the Soviet Union (1985\u20131991)#Dissolution of the USSR|breakup of the Soviet Union]] in 1991 is an ongoing concern for public health and safety.<ref>[http://en.rian.ru/world/20100218/157925732.html \"U.S. to pump money into nuke stockpile, increase security,\"] ''RIA Novosti'' 18 February 2010</ref> See [[Nuclear proliferation]].\n\n==Characteristics==\n[[File:Nuclear fission.svg|thumb|left|upright=0.7|A neutron-induced nuclear fission event involving uranium-235|alt=A diagram showing a chain transformation of uranium-235 to uranium-236 to barium-141 and krypton-92]]\nWhen [[refining (metallurgy)|refined]], uranium is a silvery white, weakly radioactive [[metal]].

If too many of these neutrons are absorbed by other uranium-235 nuclei, a [[nuclear chain reaction]] occurs that results in a burst of heat or (in special circumstances) an explosion.

Initially, two major types of fission bombs were built: a relatively simple device that uses uranium-235 and a more complicated mechanism that uses [[plutonium-239]] derived from uranium-238. Later, a much more complicated and far more powerful type of fission/fusion bomb ([[thermonuclear weapon]]) was built, that uses a plutonium-based device to cause a mixture of [[tritium]] and [[deuterium]] to undergo [[nuclear fusion]].

The {{chem|UO|2|2+}} ion represents the uranium(VI) state and is known to form compounds such as [[uranyl carbonate]], [[uranyl chloride]] and [[uranyl sulfate]]. {{chem|UO|2|2+}} also forms [[complex (chemistry)|complexes]] with various [[organic compound|organic]] [[chelation|chelating]] agents, the most commonly encountered of which is [[uranyl acetate]].<ref name=\"EncyChem778\"/>\n\nUnlike the uranyl salts of uranium and [[polyatomic ion]] uranium-oxide cationic forms, the [[uranate]]s, salts containing a polyatomic uranium-oxide anion, are generally not water-soluble.\n\n====Carbonates====\nThe interactions of carbonate anions with uranium(VI) cause the [[Pourbaix diagram]] to change greatly when the medium is changed from water to a carbonate containing solution. While the vast majority of carbonates are insoluble in water (students are often taught that all carbonates other than those of alkali metals are insoluble in water), uranium carbonates are often soluble in water. This is because a U(VI) cation is able to bind two terminal oxides and three or more carbonates to form anionic complexes.\n\n{|class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center; float:center\"\n|+[[Pourbaix diagram]]s<ref name=\"medusa\">Puigdomenech, Ignasi ''Hydra/Medusa Chemical Equilibrium Database and Plotting Software'' (2004) KTH Royal Institute of Technology, freely downloadable software at {{cite web |url=http://www.kemi.kth.se/medusa/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2007-09-29 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070929153029/http://www.kemi.kth.se/medusa/ |archivedate=29 September 2007 |df=dmy-all }}</ref>\n|[[File:Uranium pourdaix diagram in water.png|thumb|center|upright=0.8|alt=A graph of potential vs. pH showing stability regions of various uranium compounds]]\n|[[File:Uranium pourdiax diagram in carbonate media.png|center|thumb|upright=0.8|alt=A graph of potential vs. pH showing stability regions of various uranium compounds]]\n|-\n|Uranium in a non-complexing aqueous medium (e.g. [[perchloric acid]]/sodium hydroxide).<ref name=\"medusa\"/>\n|Uranium in carbonate solution\n|-\n|[[File:Uranium fraction diagram with no carbonate.png|thumb|center|alt=A graph of potential vs. pH showing stability regions of various uranium compounds]]\n|[[File:Uranium fraction diagram with carbonate present.png|thumb|center|upright=1.05|alt=A graph of potential vs. pH showing stability regions of various uranium compounds]]\n|-\n|Relative concentrations of the different chemical forms of uranium in a non-complexing aqueous medium (e.g. [[perchloric acid]]/sodium hydroxide).<ref name=\"medusa\"/>\n|Relative concentrations of the different chemical forms of uranium in an aqueous carbonate solution.<ref name=\"medusa\"/>\n|}\n\n====Effects of pH====\nThe uranium fraction diagrams in the presence of carbonate illustrate this further: when the pH of a uranium(VI) solution increases, the uranium is converted to a hydrated uranium oxide hydroxide and at high pHs it becomes an anionic hydroxide complex.\n\nWhen carbonate is added, uranium is converted to a series of carbonate complexes if the pH is increased. One effect of these reactions is increased solubility of uranium in the pH range 6 to 8, a fact that has a direct bearing on the long term stability of spent uranium dioxide nuclear fuels.\n\n===Hydrides, carbides and nitrides===\nUranium metal heated to {{convert|250|to|300|C|F}} reacts with [[hydrogen]] to form [[uranium hydride]].

All three are [[radioactive decay|radioactive]], emitting [[alpha particle]]s, with the exception that all three of these isotopes have small probabilities of undergoing [[spontaneous fission]]. There are also five other trace isotopes: uranium-239, which is formed when <sup>238</sup>U undergoes spontaneous fission, releasing neutrons that are captured by another <sup>238</sup>U atom; uranium-237, which is formed when <sup>238</sup>U captures a neutron but emits two more, which then decays to [[neptunium-237]]; and finally, uranium-233, which is formed in the [[decay chain]] of that neptunium-237. It is also expected that [[thorium-232]] should be able to undergo [[double beta decay]], which would produce uranium-232, but this has not yet been observed experimentally.<ref name=NUBASE>{{NUBASE 2003}}</ref>\n\nUranium-238 is the most stable isotope of uranium, with a [[half-life]] of about 4.468{{e|9}} years, roughly the [[age of the Earth]]. Uranium-235 has a half-life of about 7.13{{e|8}} years, and uranium-234 has a half-life of about 2.48{{e|5}} years.<ref name=\"EncyChem777\">{{Harvnb|Seaborg|1968|p=777}}.</ref>\nFor natural uranium, about 49% of its alpha rays are emitted by <sup>238</sup>U, and also 49% by <sup>234</sup>U (since the latter is formed from the former) and about 2.0% of them by the <sup>235</sup>U. When the Earth was young, probably about one-fifth of its uranium was uranium-235, but the percentage of <sup>234</sup>U was probably much lower than this.\n\nUranium-238 is usually an \u03b1 emitter (occasionally, it undergoes spontaneous fission), decaying through the [[decay chain#Uranium series|uranium series]], which has 18 members, into [[lead#Isotopes|lead-206]], by a variety of different decay paths.<ref name=\"ColumbiaEncy\"/>\n\nThe [[decay chain]] of <sup>235</sup>U, which is called the [[decay chain#Actinium series|actinium series]], has 15 members and eventually decays into lead-207.<ref name=\"ColumbiaEncy\"/> The constant rates of decay in these decay series makes the comparison of the ratios of parent to [[decay product|daughter elements]] useful in [[radiometric dating]].\n\nUranium-234, which is a member of the uranium series (the decay chain of uranium-238), decays to lead-206 through a series of relatively short-lived isotopes.\n\nUranium-233 is made from [[thorium#Isotopes|thorium-232]] by neutron bombardment, usually in a nuclear reactor, and <sup>233</sup>U is also fissile.<ref name=\"LANL\"/> Its decay chain forms part of the [[decay chain#Neptunium series|neptunium series]] and ends at [[bismuth-209]] and [[thallium]]-205.\n\nUranium-235 is important for both [[nuclear reactor]]s and [[nuclear weapon]]s, because it is the only uranium isotope existing in nature on Earth in any significant amount that is [[fissile]].

Indeed, the <sup>238</sup>U nucleus can absorb one neutron to produce the radioactive isotope [[uranium-239]]. <sup>239</sup>U decays by [[beta emission]] to [[neptunium]]-239, also a beta-emitter, that decays in its turn, within a few days into plutonium-239. <sup>239</sup>Pu was used as fissile material in the first [[atomic bomb]] detonated in the \"[[Trinity test]]\" on 15 July 1945 in [[New Mexico]].<ref name=\"EncyChem773\"/>\n\n===Enrichment===\n{{Main|Enriched uranium}}\n[[File:Gas centrifuge cascade.jpg|thumb|Cascades of [[gas centrifuge]]s are used to enrich uranium ore to concentrate its fissionable isotopes.|alt=A photo of a large hall filled with arrays of long white standing cylinders.]]\nIn nature, uranium is found as uranium-238 (99.2742%) and uranium-235 (0.7204%).

It is a silvery-grey [[metal]] in the [[actinide]] series of the [[periodic table]]. A uranium atom has 92 [[proton]]s and 92 [[electron]]s, of which 6 are [[valence electron]]s. Uranium is weakly [[radioactive decay|radioactive]] because all [[isotopes of uranium]] are unstable; the [[half-lives]] of its naturally occurring isotopes range between 159,200 years and 4.5 billion years. The most common isotopes in [[natural uranium]] are [[uranium-238]] (which has 146 [[neutron]]s and accounts for over 99% of uranium on Earth) and [[uranium-235]] (which has 143 neutrons). Uranium has the highest [[atomic weight]] of the [[primordial nuclide|primordially]] occurring elements. Its [[density]] is about 70% higher than that of [[lead]], and slightly lower than that of [[gold]] or [[tungsten]]. It occurs naturally in low concentrations of a few [[Parts-per notation#Parts-per expressions|parts per million]] in soil, rock and water, and is commercially [[uranium mining|extracted]] from uranium-bearing [[mineral]]s such as [[uraninite]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Uranium|url=https://www.britannica.com/science/uranium|website=Encyclopaedia Britannica|accessdate= 22 April 2017}}</ref>\n\nIn nature, uranium is found as uranium-238 (99.2739\u201399.2752%), uranium-235 (0.7198\u20130.7202%), and a very small amount of [[uranium-234]] (0.0050\u20130.0059%).<ref>{{cite Q|Q91488549}}</ref> Uranium decays slowly by emitting an [[alpha particle]].

Uranium-235 is the only naturally occurring [[fissile]] [[isotope]], which makes it widely used in [[nuclear power plant]]s and [[nuclear weapon]]s. However, because of the tiny amounts found in nature, uranium needs to undergo [[uranium enrichment|enrichment]] so that enough uranium-235 is present. Uranium-238 is fissionable by fast neutrons, and is [[fertile material|fertile]], meaning it can be [[Nuclear transmutation|transmuted]] to fissile [[plutonium-239]] in a [[nuclear reactor]]. Another fissile isotope, [[uranium-233]], can be produced from natural [[thorium]] and is also important in nuclear technology. Uranium-238 has a small probability for [[spontaneous fission]] or even induced fission with fast neutrons; uranium-235 and to a lesser degree uranium-233 have a much higher fission cross-section for slow neutrons. In sufficient concentration, these isotopes maintain a sustained [[nuclear chain reaction]]. This generates the heat in nuclear power reactors, and produces the fissile material for nuclear weapons. [[Depleted uranium]] (<sup>238</sup>U) is used in [[kinetic energy penetrator]]s and [[vehicle armour|armor plating]].<ref name=\"BuildingBlocks479\">{{Harvnb|Emsley|2001|p=479}}.</ref> Uranium is used as a colorant in [[uranium glass]], producing lemon yellow to green colors. Uranium glass fluoresces green in ultraviolet light. It was also used for tinting and shading in early [[photography]].\n\nThe 1789 [[discovery of the chemical elements|discovery]] of uranium in the mineral [[uraninite|pitchblende]] is credited to [[Martin Heinrich Klaproth]], who named the new element after the recently discovered planet [[Uranus]]. [[Eug\u00e8ne-Melchior P\u00e9ligot]] was the first person to isolate the metal and its radioactive properties were discovered in 1896 by [[Henri Becquerel]]. Research by [[Otto Hahn]], [[Lise Meitner]], [[Enrico Fermi]] and others, such as [[J. Robert Oppenheimer]] starting in 1934 led to its use as a fuel in the nuclear power industry and in ''[[Little Boy]]'', the [[Atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki|first nuclear weapon used in war]]. An ensuing [[arms race]] during the [[Cold War]] between the [[United States]] and the [[Soviet Union]] produced tens of thousands of nuclear weapons that used uranium metal and uranium-derived [[plutonium-239]]. The security of those weapons and their fissile material following the [[Collapse of the Soviet Union (1985\u20131991)#Dissolution of the USSR|breakup of the Soviet Union]] in 1991 is an ongoing concern for public health and safety.<ref>[http://en.rian.ru/world/20100218/157925732.html \"U.S. to pump money into nuke stockpile, increase security,\"] ''RIA Novosti'' 18 February 2010</ref> See [[Nuclear proliferation]].\n\n==Characteristics==\n[[File:Nuclear fission.svg|thumb|left|upright=0.7|A neutron-induced nuclear fission event involving uranium-235|alt=A diagram showing a chain transformation of uranium-235 to uranium-236 to barium-141 and krypton-92]]\nWhen [[refining (metallurgy)|refined]], uranium is a silvery white, weakly radioactive [[metal]].

Other naturally occurring isotopes are fissionable, but not fissile. On bombardment with slow neutrons, its uranium-235 [[isotope]] will most of the time divide into two smaller [[atomic nucleus|nuclei]], releasing nuclear [[binding energy]] and more neutrons. If too many of these neutrons are absorbed by other uranium-235 nuclei, a [[nuclear chain reaction]] occurs that results in a burst of heat or (in special circumstances) an explosion. In a nuclear reactor, such a chain reaction is slowed and controlled by a [[neutron poison]], absorbing some of the free neutrons. Such neutron absorbent materials are often part of reactor [[control rod]]s (see [[nuclear reactor physics]] for a description of this process of reactor control).\n\nAs little as 15&nbsp;lb (7&nbsp;kg) of uranium-235 can be used to make an atomic bomb.<ref name=\"EncyIntel\">{{cite encyclopedia|encyclopedia=Encyclopedia of Espionage, Intelligence, and Security|publisher=The Gale Group, Inc.|title=uranium|url=http://www.answers.com/uranium}}</ref> The first nuclear bomb used in war, ''[[Little Boy]]'', relied on uranium fission, but the very first nuclear explosive (the ''Gadget'' used at [[Trinity (nuclear test)|Trinity]]) and the bomb that destroyed Nagasaki (''[[Fat Man]]'') were both plutonium bombs.\n\nUranium metal has three [[allotropy|allotropic]] forms:<ref>{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/?id=KWGu-LYMYjMC&pg=PA108 |page=108 |title=Applications of Texture Analysis |author=Rollett, A.

Initially, two major types of fission bombs were built: a relatively simple device that uses uranium-235 and a more complicated mechanism that uses [[plutonium-239]] derived from uranium-238. Later, a much more complicated and far more powerful type of fission/fusion bomb ([[thermonuclear weapon]]) was built, that uses a plutonium-based device to cause a mixture of [[tritium]] and [[deuterium]] to undergo [[nuclear fusion]]. Such bombs are jacketed in a non-fissile (unenriched) uranium case, and they derive more than half their power from the fission of this material by [[fast neutron]]s from the nuclear fusion process.<ref>{{cite web\n |url=https://fas.org/nuke/intro/nuke/design.htm\n |title=Nuclear Weapon Design\n |publisher=Federation of American Scientists\n |date=1998\n |accessdate=19 February 2007\n |url-status=dead\n |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081226091803/https://fas.org/nuke/intro/nuke/design.htm\n |archivedate=26 December 2008\n}}</ref>\n\n===Civilian===\n[[File:Nuclear Power Plant 2.jpg|thumb|The most visible civilian use of uranium is as the thermal power source used in [[nuclear power plant]]s.|alt=Photograph featuring sunflowers in front and a plant on the back.

One effect of these reactions is increased solubility of uranium in the pH range 6 to 8, a fact that has a direct bearing on the long term stability of spent uranium dioxide nuclear fuels.\n\n===Hydrides, carbides and nitrides===\nUranium metal heated to {{convert|250|to|300|C|F}} reacts with [[hydrogen]] to form [[uranium hydride]].

In \"The Letter\", writer [[Vernon Green]] made up the word ''puppetutes'', meaning a paper-doll erotic fantasy figure;<ref>[http://www.straightdope.com/classics/a4_065.html 'In Steve Miller's \"The

That the picture used most of two pages was in itself unusual.  The photograph was part of the magazine's coverage of the [[3rd Sculpture International]] exhibition, which was organized by the Fairmount Park Art Association (now the [[Association for Public Art]]) and held at the [[Philadelphia Museum of Art]] from May 15 to September 11, 1949.

All modern rails are [[hot rolled]] [[steel]] with a cross section [[Profile (engineering)|(profile)]] approximate to an [[I-beam]], but asymmetric about a horizontal axis (however see grooved rail below). The head is profiled to resist wear and to give a good ride, and the foot profiled to suit the fixing system.\n\nUnlike some other uses of [[iron]] and steel, railway rails are subject to very high stresses and are made of very high quality steel. It took many decades to improve the quality of the materials, including the change from iron to steel. Minor flaws in the steel that may pose no problems in other applications can lead to broken rails and dangerous [[derailment]]s when used on railway tracks.\n\nBy and large, the heavier the rails and the rest of the trackwork, the heavier and faster the [[train]]s these tracks can carry.\n\nRails represent a substantial fraction of the cost of a railway line. Only a small number of rail sizes are made by steelworks at one time, so a railway must choose the nearest suitable size. Worn, heavy rail from a mainline is often reclaimed and downgraded for re-use on a [[Branch line|branchline]], [[Rail siding|siding]] or [[Classification yard|yard]].\n\n==Rail weights and sizes==\n[[Image:Rail profile nmbs.JPG|thumb|Two commonly used rail profiles: a heavily worn 50-kg/m profile and a new 60-kg/m profile]]\nThe weight of a rail per length is an important factor in determining rail strength and hence [[axleload]]s and speeds.\n\nWeights are measured in pounds per yard ([[imperial units]] are used in Canada, the United Kingdom and United States) or kilograms per metre (metric units are used in Australia and [[Continental Europe|mainland Europe]]).  As a kilogram is approximately 2.2&nbsp;lb and a metre is roughly 1.1 yards, the pounds-per-yard figure is almost exactly double the kilograms-per-metre figure.  (More specifically {{cvt|1|kg/m|4|disp=x|{{sp}}{{=}}{{sp}}}}.)\n\nCommonly, in rail terminology ''pound'' is a contraction of the expression ''pounds per yard'' and hence a 132\u2013pound rail means a rail of 132&nbsp;pounds per yard.\n\n=== Europe ===\nRails are made in a large number of different sizes.

Thermally hardened {{cvt|75|kg/m|0}} rails also have been used on heavy-duty railroads like [[Baikal\u2013Amur Mainline]], but have proven themselves deficient in operation and were mainly rejected in favor of {{cvt|65|kg/m|0}} rails.<ref>{{cite web| url=http://finance.groups.yahoo.com/group/1520mm/message/90710| title=message in the mailing list '1520 mm' on \u042075 rails| url-status=live| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090705135244/http://finance.groups.yahoo.com/group/1520mm/message/90710| archivedate=5 July 2009| df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\n=== North America ===\n[[File:THORN-155lb-PS-jointed.jpg|thumb|Weight mark \"155 PS\" on a jointed segment of {{cvt|155|lb/yd|1}} \"Pennsylvania Special\" rail, the heaviest grade of rail ever mass-produced]]\n[[File:PRR rail section drawing.png|thumb|Cross-section drawing showing measurements in Imperial units for {{cvt|100|lb/yd|1|adj=on}} rail used in the United States, c. 1890s]]\n[[File:NYCS DUDLEY 127 LBS.png|thumb|New York Central System Dudley {{cvt|127|lb/yd|1|adj=on}} rail cross section]]\nThe [[American Society of Civil Engineers]] (or ASCE) specified rail profiles in 1893 for {{cvt|5|lb/yd|1|adj=on}} increments from {{cvt|40|to|100|lb/yd|1}}. Height of rail equaled width of foot for each ASCE tee-rail weight; and the profiles specified fixed proportion of weight in head, web and foot of 42%, 21% and 37%, respectively. ASCE {{cvt|90|lb/yd|1}} profile was adequate; but heavier weights were less satisfactory. In 1909, the [[American Railway Association]] (or ARA) specified standard profiles for {{cvt|10|lb/yd|2|adj=on}} increments from {{cvt|60|to|100|lb/yd|1}}. The American Railway Engineering Association (or AREA) specified standard profiles for {{cvt|100|lb/yd|1}}, {{cvt|110|lb/yd|1}} and {{cvt|120|lb/yd|1}} rails in 1919, for {{cvt|130|lb/yd|1}} and {{cvt|140|lb/yd|1}} rails in 1920, and for {{cvt|150|lb/yd|1}} rails in 1924. The trend was to increase rail height/foot-width ratio and strengthen the web. Disadvantages of the narrower foot were overcome through use of [[tie plate]]s. AREA recommendations reduced the relative weight of rail head down to 36%, while alternative profiles reduced head weight to 33% in heavier weight rails. Attention was also focused on improved fillet radii to reduce stress concentration at the web junction with the head. AREA recommended the ARA {{cvt|90|lb/yd|1}} profile.<ref>{{cite book|last=Raymond|first= William G.|title=The Elements of Railroad Engineering|edition= 5th |publisher=  John Wiley and Sons|date= 1937}}</ref> Old ASCE rails of lighter weight remained in use, and satisfied the limited demand for light rail for a few decades. AREA merged into the [[American Railway Engineering and Maintenance-of-Way Association]] in 1997. By the mid-20th century, most rail production was ''medium heavy'' ({{cvt|112|to|119|lb/yd|1|disp=or}}) and ''heavy'' ({{cvt|127|to|140|lb/yd|1|disp=or}}). Sizes under {{cvt|100|lb/yd|1}} rail are usually for lighter duty freight, low use trackage, or [[light rail]]. Track using {{cvt|100|to|120|lb/yd|1}} rail is for lower speed freight [[branch line]]s or [[rapid transit]] (for example, most of the [[New York City Subway]] system track is constructed with {{cvt|100|lb/yd|1}} rail).

However, the long-term expense involved in frequent maintenance outweighed any savings.<ref>{{cite web|title=What was a Railroad?|url=http://www.buffalohistoryworks.com/ptracks/chapter4/chapter4.htm|work=(Includes illustration of a length of strap rail.)|publisher=Past Tracks|accessdate=1 February 2011|url-status =dead|archiveurl =https://web.archive.org/web/20110523074609/http://www.buffalohistoryworks.com/ptracks/chapter4/chapter4.htm|archivedate =23 May 2011}}</ref><ref name=\"Bianculli2002\" />\n\nThese were superseded by cast iron rails that were flanged (i.e. 'L' shaped) and with the wagon wheels flat. An early proponent of this design was [[Benjamin Outram]]. His partner [[William Jessop]] preferred the use of \"[[edge rail]]s\" in 1789 where the wheels were flanged and, over time, it was realised that this combination worked better.\n\nThe earliest of these in general use were the so-called cast iron '''fishbelly''' rails from their shape. Rails made from cast iron were [[brittle]] and broke easily. They could only be made in short lengths which would soon become uneven. [[John Birkinshaw]]'s 1820 patent,<ref>\n{{cite book|title=Specification of John Birkinshaw's Patent, for an Improvement in the Construction of Malleable Iron Rails, to be used in Rail roads; with Remarks on the comparative Merits of Cast Metal and Malleable Iron Railways|first=Michael|last= Longridge|location=Newcastle|publisher= E.

The cross-section varied widely from one line to another, but were of three basic types as shown in the diagram. The parallel cross-section which developed in later years was referred to as '''Bullhead'''.\n\nMeanwhile, in May 1831, the first [[flanged T rail]] (also called T-section) arrived in America from Britain and was laid into the [[Pennsylvania Railroad]] by [[Camden and Amboy Railroad]]. They were also used by [[Charles Blacker Vignoles|Charles Vignoles]] in Britain.\n\nThe first steel rails were made in 1857 by [[Robert Forester Mushet]], who laid them at [[Derby Midland railway station|Derby station]] in England.<ref>{{cite book|last=Marshall|first= John|title=The Guinness Book of Rail Facts & Feats|date=1979|isbn=0-900424-56-7}}</ref> Steel is a much stronger material, which steadily replaced iron for use on railway rail and allowed much longer lengths of rails to be rolled.\n\nThe [[American Railway Engineering Association]] (AREA) and the [[ASTM International|American Society for Testing Materials]] (ASTM) specified carbon, manganese, silicon and phosphorus content for steel rails. Tensile strength increases with carbon content, while ductility decreases. AREA and ASTM specified 0.55 to 0.77 percent carbon in {{convert|70|to|90|lb/yd|kg/m|1|adj=on}} rail, 0.67 to 0.80 percent in rail weights from {{convert|90|to|120|lb/yd|kg/m|1|abbr=on}}, and 0.69 to 0.82 percent for heavier rails. Manganese increases strength and resistance to abrasion. AREA and ASTM specified 0.6 to 0.9 percent manganese in 70 to 90&nbsp;pound rail and 0.7 to 1 percent in heavier rails.

To resist wear a thin iron strap was laid on top of the timber rail.  This saved money as wood was cheaper than metal. The system had the flaw that every so often the passage of the wheels on the train would cause the strap to break away from the timber. The problem was first reported by [[Richard Trevithick#\"Pen-y-Darren\" locomotive|Richard Trevithick]] in 1802.  The use of strap rails in the United States (for instance on the [[Albany and Schenectady Railroad]] {{circa}} 1837) led to passengers being threatened by \"snake-heads\" when the straps curled up and penetrated the carriages.<ref name=\"Bianculli2002\" />\n\n===Plate rail===\n<!-- \"flanged rail\" redirects here -->\n{{Main|Plateway}}\n'''Plate rail''' was an early type of rail and had an 'L' cross section in which the flange kept an unflanged wheel on the track.  The flanged rail has seen a minor revival in the 1950s, as [[guide bar]]s, with the Paris M\u00e9tro (''[[Rubber-tyred metro]]'' or French ''[[:fr:M\u00e9tro sur pneumatiques|M\u00e9tro sur pneus]]'') and more recently as the [[Guided bus]].  In the [[Cambridgeshire Guided Busway]] the rail is a {{convert|350|mm|abbr=on}} thick concrete beam with a {{convert|180|mm|abbr=on}} lip to form the flange.  The buses run on normal road wheels with side-mounted guidewheels to run against the flanges.  Buses are steered normally when off the busway, analogous to the 18th-century wagons which could be manoeuvered around pitheads before joining the track for the longer haul.\n\n=== Bridge rail ===\n[[File:Baulk road crossing.jpg|thumb|right|A GWR [[baulk road]] laid in bridge rail]]\n'''Bridge rail''' is a rail with an inverted-U profile. Its simple shape is easy to manufacture, and it was widely used before more sophisticated profiles became cheap enough to make in bulk. It was notably used on [[Isambard Kingdom Brunel]]'s Great Western Railway which was built to a gauge of {{RailGauge|7ft0.25in|lk=on}} and used a [[baulk road]].\n\n===Barlow rail===\n[[Image:Arhs barlow.jpg|thumb|left|Cross section of [[Barlow rail]] as used by [[Sydney Railway Company]]]]\n{{main|Barlow rail}}\n'''Barlow rail''' was invented by [[William Henry Barlow]] in 1849. It was designed to be laid straight onto the [[Track ballast|ballast]], but the lack of [[Railroad tie|sleepers]] (ties) meant that it was difficult to keep it in [[Rail gauge|gauge]].\n\n===Flat bottomed rail===\n[[Image:FT Rail.jpg|thumb|right|Cross section of new flat bottomed rail]]\nFlat bottomed rail is the dominant rail profile in worldwide use.\n\n==== Flanged T rail ====\n'''Flanged T rail''' (also called T-section) is the name for flat bottomed rail used in [[North-America]].\nIron-strapped wooden rails were used on all American railways until 1831. Col. [[Robert L. Stevens]], the President of the [[Camden and Amboy Railroad]], conceived the idea that an all-iron rail would be better suited for building a railroad. There were no steel mills in America capable of rolling long lengths, so he sailed to the United Kingdom which was the only place where his flanged T rail (also called T-section) could be rolled. Railways in the UK had been using rolled rail of other cross-sections which the [[ironmaster]]s had produced.\n\nIn May 1831, the first 500 rails, each {{convert|15|ft}} long and weighing {{convert|36|lb/yd|kg/m|1}}, reached [[Philadelphia]] and were placed in the track, marking the first use of the flanged T rail. Afterwards, the flanged T rail became employed by all railroads in the United States.\n\nCol. Stevens also invented the [[Rail spike|hooked spike]] for attaching the rail to the [[Railroad tie|crosstie]] (or [[Sleeper (rail)|sleeper]]). At the present time, the screw spike is being used widely in place of the hooked spike.\n\n==== Vignoles rail ====\n[[Image:Vignoles rail early.jpg|thumb|Vignoles Rail as used for the [[London and Croydon Railway]] in 1839]]\n[[Image:Vignoles rail.jpg|thumb|Vignoles rail as used for the [[Birmingham and Gloucester Railway]] in 1840]]\n'''Vignoles rail''' is the popular name of the flat-bottomed rail, recognising engineer [[Charles Vignoles]] who introduced it to [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland|Britain]].\nCharles Vignoles observed that wear was occurring with [[wrought iron]] rails and [[cast iron]] chairs upon stone blocks, the most common system at that time. In 1836 he recommended flat-bottomed rail to the [[London and Croydon Railway]] for which he was consulting engineer.\nHis original rail had a smaller cross-section than the Stevens rail, with a wider base than modern rail, fastened with screws through the base. Other lines which adopted it were the [[Hull and Selby Railway|Hull and Selby]], the [[Newcastle & North Shields Railway|Newcastle and North Shields]], and the [[Manchester, Bolton and Bury Canal|Manchester, Bolton and Bury Canal Navigation and Railway Company.]]<ref>{{cite book|last=Ransom|first= P.J.G.|date=1990|title=The Victorian Railway and How it Evolved|location=London|publisher= Heinemann}}</ref>\n\nWhen it became possible to preserve wooden sleepers with [[mercuric chloride]] (a process called [[Kyanising]]) and [[creosote]], they gave a much quieter ride than stone blocks and it was possible to fasten the rails directly using [[Rail anchor|clips]] or [[rail spike]]s. Their use spread worldwide and acquired Vignoles' name.\n\nThe joint where the ends of two rails are connected to each other is the weakest part of a rail line. The earliest iron rails were joined by a simple fishplate or bar of metal bolted through the web of the rail. Stronger methods of joining two rails together have been developed. When sufficient metal is put into the rail joint, the joint is almost as strong as the rest of the rail length. The noise generated by trains passing over the rail joints, described as \"the clickity clack of the railroad track\", can be eliminated by welding the rail sections together. [[Continuously welded rail]] has a uniform top profile even at the joints.\n\n=== Double-headed rail ===\n[[File:Double-headed_rail.jpg|thumb|right|Double-headed rail on the [[Mid-Norfolk Railway]].]]\nIn late 1830s Britain, railway lines had a vast range of different patterns. One of the earliest lines to use double-headed rail was the [[London and Birmingham Railway]], which had offered a prize for the best design. This rail was supported by [[Chair (railway)|chairs]] and the head and foot of the rail had the same profile. The supposed advantage was that, when the head became worn, the rail could be turned over and re-used. In practice, this form of recycling was not very successful as the chair caused dents in the lower surface, and double-headed rail evolved into bullhead rail in which the head was more substantial than the foot.\n\n=== Bullhead rail ===\nBullhead rail was the standard for the British railway system from the mid-19th until the mid-20th century. For example, in 1954 bullhead rail was used for {{convert|449|mi}} of new track and flat-bottom for {{convert|923|mi}}.<ref>{{cite magazine |magazine=The Railway Magazine |date=June 1954 |page=433 |editor-first=B.W.C. |editor-last=Cooke |publisher=Tothill Press |location=Westminster |number=638 |volume=100 |title=B.R. Track Renewal Programme }}</ref> One of the first [[British Standards]], BS 9, was for bullhead rail - it was originally published in 1905, and revised in 1924.  Rails manufactured to the 1905 standard were referred to as \"O.B.S.\" (Original), and those manufactured to the 1924 standard as \"R.B.S.\" (Revised).<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.valleysignals.org.nz/railbrands/railbrands.html |title=Handbook For Permanent Way Staff |year=1958 |work=Rail Brands |accessdate=13 September 2010 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110723143905/http://www.valleysignals.org.nz/railbrands/railbrands.html |archivedate=23 July 2011  }}</ref>\n\nBullhead rail is similar to double-headed rail except that the profile of the head of the rail is not the same as that of the foot. Bullhead rail evolved from double-headed rail but, because it did not have a symmetrical profile, it was never possible to flip it over and use the foot as the head. Therefore, because the rail no longer had the originally-perceived benefit of reusability, it was a very expensive method of laying track. Heavy cast iron [[Rail chair|chairs]] were needed to support the rail, which was secured in the chairs by wooden (later steel) wedges or \"keys\" which required regular attention.\n\nBullhead rail has now been almost completely replaced by flat-bottom rail on British railways, although it survives on the national rail system in some [[Rail siding|sidings]] or branch lines. It can also be found on [[heritage railways]], due both to the desire to maintain an historic appearance, and the salvage and reuse of old track components from the main lines. The [[London Underground]] continued to use bullhead rail after it had been phased out elsewhere in Britain, but in the last few years has there been a concerted effort to convert its track to flat-bottom rail.<ref>{{cite web|title=London Underground Track and Traction Current|url=http://www.trainweb.org/tubeprune/tractioncurr.htm|publisher=The Tubeprune|accessdate=22 March 2013|url-status =live|archiveurl =https://web.archive.org/web/20120924051652/http://www.trainweb.org/tubeprune/tractioncurr.htm|archivedate= 24 September 2012}}</ref> However, the process of replacing track in tunnels is a slow process due to the impossibility of using heavy plant and machinery.\n\n=== Grooved rail ===\n{{See also|Tramway track#Grooved rail}}\n[[File:Szyny G\u0142ogowska RB2.JPG|thumb|right|upright|Cross section of a grooved tram rail]]\n[[File:TreinTramwielprofiel.svg|thumb|right|Difference in form and profile of the wheel and the rail of a train (left, blue) and a [[tram]] (right, green).]]\n\nWhere a rail is laid in a [[Road surface]] (pavement) or within grassed surfaces, there has to be accommodation for the flange.  This is provided by a [[Groove (engineering)|slot]] called the flangeway.  The rail is then known as '''grooved rail''', '''groove rail''', or '''girder rail'''.  The flangeway has the railhead on one side and the guard on the other.  The guard carries no weight, but may act as a checkrail.\n\nGrooved rail was invented in 1852 by [[Alphonse Loubat]], a French inventor who developed improvements in [[tram]] and rail equipment, and helped develop tram lines in New York City and Paris.  The invention of grooved rail enabled tramways to be laid without causing a nuisance to other road users, except unsuspecting cyclists, who could get their wheels caught in the groove.  The grooves may become filled with gravel and dirt (particularly if infrequently used or after a period of idleness) and need clearing from time to time, this being done by a \"scrubber\" tram.  Failure to clear the grooves can lead to a bumpy ride for the passengers, damage to either wheel or rail and possibly derailing.\n\nA modern grooved rail is the LR55 which is polyurethane grouted into a prefabricated concrete beam set in the grooves cut into an existing asphalt road bed for ULT Ultra Light Rail (trams).{{cite web|url=http://www.bathtram.org/tfb/LR55.gif |title=LR55 rail in comparison with a British Standard B.R.3 tramway rail}}\n\n====Girder guard rail====\nThe traditional form of grooved rail is the girder guard section illustrated to the right.  This rail is a modified form of flanged rail and requires a special mounting for weight transfer and gauge stabilisation.  If the weight is carried by the roadway subsurface, steel ties are needed at regular intervals to maintain the gauge.  Installing these means that the whole surface needs to be excavated and reinstated.\n\n====Block rail====\nBlock rail is a lower profile form of girder guard rail with the web eliminated.  In profile it is more like a solid form of bridge rail, with a flangeway and guard added.  Simply removing the web and combining the head section directly with the foot section would result in a weak rail, so additional thickness is required in the combined section.<ref>{{webarchive| url= https://web.archive.org/web/20131004231441/http://www.skelton-metals.com/railsections_eurogirderguardrail.htm |title=Grooved or girder rail }}</ref>\n\n== Rail lengths ==\n{{main|Rail lengths}}\nRails should be made as long as possible since joints between raillengths are a source of weakness.

All modern rails are [[hot rolled]] [[steel]] with a cross section [[Profile (engineering)|(profile)]] approximate to an [[I-beam]], but asymmetric about a horizontal axis (however see grooved rail below). The head is profiled to resist wear and to give a good ride, and the foot profiled to suit the fixing system.\n\nUnlike some other uses of [[iron]] and steel, railway rails are subject to very high stresses and are made of very high quality steel. It took many decades to improve the quality of the materials, including the change from iron to steel. Minor flaws in the steel that may pose no problems in other applications can lead to broken rails and dangerous [[derailment]]s when used on railway tracks.\n\nBy and large, the heavier the rails and the rest of the trackwork, the heavier and faster the [[train]]s these tracks can carry.\n\nRails represent a substantial fraction of the cost of a railway line. Only a small number of rail sizes are made by steelworks at one time, so a railway must choose the nearest suitable size. Worn, heavy rail from a mainline is often reclaimed and downgraded for re-use on a [[Branch line|branchline]], [[Rail siding|siding]] or [[Classification yard|yard]].\n\n==Rail weights and sizes==\n[[Image:Rail profile nmbs.JPG|thumb|Two commonly used rail profiles: a heavily worn 50-kg/m profile and a new 60-kg/m profile]]\nThe weight of a rail per length is an important factor in determining rail strength and hence [[axleload]]s and speeds.\n\nWeights are measured in pounds per yard ([[imperial units]] are used in Canada, the United Kingdom and United States) or kilograms per metre (metric units are used in Australia and [[Continental Europe|mainland Europe]]).  As a kilogram is approximately 2.2&nbsp;lb and a metre is roughly 1.1 yards, the pounds-per-yard figure is almost exactly double the kilograms-per-metre figure.  (More specifically {{cvt|1|kg/m|4|disp=x|{{sp}}{{=}}{{sp}}}}.)\n\nCommonly, in rail terminology ''pound'' is a contraction of the expression ''pounds per yard'' and hence a 132\u2013pound rail means a rail of 132&nbsp;pounds per yard.\n\n=== Europe ===\nRails are made in a large number of different sizes.

Height of rail equaled width of foot for each ASCE tee-rail weight; and the profiles specified fixed proportion of weight in head, web and foot of 42%, 21% and 37%, respectively. ASCE {{cvt|90|lb/yd|1}} profile was adequate; but heavier weights were less satisfactory. In 1909, the [[American Railway Association]] (or ARA) specified standard profiles for {{cvt|10|lb/yd|2|adj=on}} increments from {{cvt|60|to|100|lb/yd|1}}. The American Railway Engineering Association (or AREA) specified standard profiles for {{cvt|100|lb/yd|1}}, {{cvt|110|lb/yd|1}} and {{cvt|120|lb/yd|1}} rails in 1919, for {{cvt|130|lb/yd|1}} and {{cvt|140|lb/yd|1}} rails in 1920, and for {{cvt|150|lb/yd|1}} rails in 1924. The trend was to increase rail height/foot-width ratio and strengthen the web. Disadvantages of the narrower foot were overcome through use of [[tie plate]]s. AREA recommendations reduced the relative weight of rail head down to 36%, while alternative profiles reduced head weight to 33% in heavier weight rails. Attention was also focused on improved fillet radii to reduce stress concentration at the web junction with the head. AREA recommended the ARA {{cvt|90|lb/yd|1}} profile.<ref>{{cite book|last=Raymond|first= William G.|title=The Elements of Railroad Engineering|edition= 5th |publisher=  John Wiley and Sons|date= 1937}}</ref> Old ASCE rails of lighter weight remained in use, and satisfied the limited demand for light rail for a few decades. AREA merged into the [[American Railway Engineering and Maintenance-of-Way Association]] in 1997. By the mid-20th century, most rail production was ''medium heavy'' ({{cvt|112|to|119|lb/yd|1|disp=or}}) and ''heavy'' ({{cvt|127|to|140|lb/yd|1|disp=or}}). Sizes under {{cvt|100|lb/yd|1}} rail are usually for lighter duty freight, low use trackage, or [[light rail]].

Strap rails sometimes separated from the wooden base and speared into the floor of the carriages above, creating what was referred to as a \"snake head\".  However, the long-term expense involved in frequent maintenance outweighed any savings.<ref>{{cite web|title=What was a Railroad?|url=http://www.buffalohistoryworks.com/ptracks/chapter4/chapter4.htm|work=(Includes illustration of a length of strap rail.)|publisher=Past Tracks|accessdate=1 February 2011|url-status =dead|archiveurl =https://web.archive.org/web/20110523074609/http://www.buffalohistoryworks.com/ptracks/chapter4/chapter4.htm|archivedate =23 May 2011}}</ref><ref name=\"Bianculli2002\" />\n\nThese were superseded by cast iron rails that were flanged (i.e. 'L' shaped) and with the wagon wheels flat. An early proponent of this design was [[Benjamin Outram]]. His partner [[William Jessop]] preferred the use of \"[[edge rail]]s\" in 1789 where the wheels were flanged and, over time, it was realised that this combination worked better.\n\nThe earliest of these in general use were the so-called cast iron '''fishbelly''' rails from their shape. Rails made from cast iron were [[brittle]] and broke easily. They could only be made in short lengths which would soon become uneven. [[John Birkinshaw]]'s 1820 patent,<ref>\n{{cite book|title=Specification of John Birkinshaw's Patent, for an Improvement in the Construction of Malleable Iron Rails, to be used in Rail roads; with Remarks on the comparative Merits of Cast Metal and Malleable Iron Railways|first=Michael|last= Longridge|location=Newcastle|publisher= E.

The cross-section varied widely from one line to another, but were of three basic types as shown in the diagram. The parallel cross-section which developed in later years was referred to as '''Bullhead'''.\n\nMeanwhile, in May 1831, the first [[flanged T rail]] (also called T-section) arrived in America from Britain and was laid into the [[Pennsylvania Railroad]] by [[Camden and Amboy Railroad]]. They were also used by [[Charles Blacker Vignoles|Charles Vignoles]] in Britain.\n\nThe first steel rails were made in 1857 by [[Robert Forester Mushet]], who laid them at [[Derby Midland railway station|Derby station]] in England.<ref>{{cite book|last=Marshall|first= John|title=The Guinness Book of Rail Facts & Feats|date=1979|isbn=0-900424-56-7}}</ref> Steel is a much stronger material, which steadily replaced iron for use on railway rail and allowed much longer lengths of rails to be rolled.\n\nThe [[American Railway Engineering Association]] (AREA) and the [[ASTM International|American Society for Testing Materials]] (ASTM) specified carbon, manganese, silicon and phosphorus content for steel rails. Tensile strength increases with carbon content, while ductility decreases. AREA and ASTM specified 0.55 to 0.77 percent carbon in {{convert|70|to|90|lb/yd|kg/m|1|adj=on}} rail, 0.67 to 0.80 percent in rail weights from {{convert|90|to|120|lb/yd|kg/m|1|abbr=on}}, and 0.69 to 0.82 percent for heavier rails. Manganese increases strength and resistance to abrasion. AREA and ASTM specified 0.6 to 0.9 percent manganese in 70 to 90&nbsp;pound rail and 0.7 to 1 percent in heavier rails. Silicon is preferentially oxidised by oxygen and is added to reduce the formation of weakening metal oxides in the rail rolling and casting procedures.<ref>{{cite book|last=Hay|first= William W.|title= Railroad engineering|volume= Vol 1|chapter= Ch 24 Rail|pp=484\u2013485|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ygKio-Ks0doC&lpg=PA484}}</ref> AREA and ASTM specified 0.1 to 0.23 percent silicon.

To resist wear a thin iron strap was laid on top of the timber rail.  This saved money as wood was cheaper than metal. The system had the flaw that every so often the passage of the wheels on the train would cause the strap to break away from the timber. The problem was first reported by [[Richard Trevithick#\"Pen-y-Darren\" locomotive|Richard Trevithick]] in 1802.  The use of strap rails in the United States (for instance on the [[Albany and Schenectady Railroad]] {{circa}} 1837) led to passengers being threatened by \"snake-heads\" when the straps curled up and penetrated the carriages.<ref name=\"Bianculli2002\" />\n\n===Plate rail===\n<!-- \"flanged rail\" redirects here -->\n{{Main|Plateway}}\n'''Plate rail''' was an early type of rail and had an 'L' cross section in which the flange kept an unflanged wheel on the track.  The flanged rail has seen a minor revival in the 1950s, as [[guide bar]]s, with the Paris M\u00e9tro (''[[Rubber-tyred metro]]'' or French ''[[:fr:M\u00e9tro sur pneumatiques|M\u00e9tro sur pneus]]'') and more recently as the [[Guided bus]].  In the [[Cambridgeshire Guided Busway]] the rail is a {{convert|350|mm|abbr=on}} thick concrete beam with a {{convert|180|mm|abbr=on}} lip to form the flange.  The buses run on normal road wheels with side-mounted guidewheels to run against the flanges.  Buses are steered normally when off the busway, analogous to the 18th-century wagons which could be manoeuvered around pitheads before joining the track for the longer haul.\n\n=== Bridge rail ===\n[[File:Baulk road crossing.jpg|thumb|right|A GWR [[baulk road]] laid in bridge rail]]\n'''Bridge rail''' is a rail with an inverted-U profile. Its simple shape is easy to manufacture, and it was widely used before more sophisticated profiles became cheap enough to make in bulk. It was notably used on [[Isambard Kingdom Brunel]]'s Great Western Railway which was built to a gauge of {{RailGauge|7ft0.25in|lk=on}} and used a [[baulk road]].\n\n===Barlow rail===\n[[Image:Arhs barlow.jpg|thumb|left|Cross section of [[Barlow rail]] as used by [[Sydney Railway Company]]]]\n{{main|Barlow rail}}\n'''Barlow rail''' was invented by [[William Henry Barlow]] in 1849. It was designed to be laid straight onto the [[Track ballast|ballast]], but the lack of [[Railroad tie|sleepers]] (ties) meant that it was difficult to keep it in [[Rail gauge|gauge]].\n\n===Flat bottomed rail===\n[[Image:FT Rail.jpg|thumb|right|Cross section of new flat bottomed rail]]\nFlat bottomed rail is the dominant rail profile in worldwide use.\n\n==== Flanged T rail ====\n'''Flanged T rail''' (also called T-section) is the name for flat bottomed rail used in [[North-America]].\nIron-strapped wooden rails were used on all American railways until 1831. Col. [[Robert L. Stevens]], the President of the [[Camden and Amboy Railroad]], conceived the idea that an all-iron rail would be better suited for building a railroad. There were no steel mills in America capable of rolling long lengths, so he sailed to the United Kingdom which was the only place where his flanged T rail (also called T-section) could be rolled. Railways in the UK had been using rolled rail of other cross-sections which the [[ironmaster]]s had produced.\n\nIn May 1831, the first 500 rails, each {{convert|15|ft}} long and weighing {{convert|36|lb/yd|kg/m|1}}, reached [[Philadelphia]] and were placed in the track, marking the first use of the flanged T rail. Afterwards, the flanged T rail became employed by all railroads in the United States.\n\nCol. Stevens also invented the [[Rail spike|hooked spike]] for attaching the rail to the [[Railroad tie|crosstie]] (or [[Sleeper (rail)|sleeper]]). At the present time, the screw spike is being used widely in place of the hooked spike.\n\n==== Vignoles rail ====\n[[Image:Vignoles rail early.jpg|thumb|Vignoles Rail as used for the [[London and Croydon Railway]] in 1839]]\n[[Image:Vignoles rail.jpg|thumb|Vignoles rail as used for the [[Birmingham and Gloucester Railway]] in 1840]]\n'''Vignoles rail''' is the popular name of the flat-bottomed rail, recognising engineer [[Charles Vignoles]] who introduced it to [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland|Britain]].\nCharles Vignoles observed that wear was occurring with [[wrought iron]] rails and [[cast iron]] chairs upon stone blocks, the most common system at that time. In 1836 he recommended flat-bottomed rail to the [[London and Croydon Railway]] for which he was consulting engineer.\nHis original rail had a smaller cross-section than the Stevens rail, with a wider base than modern rail, fastened with screws through the base. Other lines which adopted it were the [[Hull and Selby Railway|Hull and Selby]], the [[Newcastle & North Shields Railway|Newcastle and North Shields]], and the [[Manchester, Bolton and Bury Canal|Manchester, Bolton and Bury Canal Navigation and Railway Company.]]<ref>{{cite book|last=Ransom|first= P.J.G.|date=1990|title=The Victorian Railway and How it Evolved|location=London|publisher= Heinemann}}</ref>\n\nWhen it became possible to preserve wooden sleepers with [[mercuric chloride]] (a process called [[Kyanising]]) and [[creosote]], they gave a much quieter ride than stone blocks and it was possible to fasten the rails directly using [[Rail anchor|clips]] or [[rail spike]]s. Their use spread worldwide and acquired Vignoles' name.\n\nThe joint where the ends of two rails are connected to each other is the weakest part of a rail line. The earliest iron rails were joined by a simple fishplate or bar of metal bolted through the web of the rail. Stronger methods of joining two rails together have been developed. When sufficient metal is put into the rail joint, the joint is almost as strong as the rest of the rail length. The noise generated by trains passing over the rail joints, described as \"the clickity clack of the railroad track\", can be eliminated by welding the rail sections together. [[Continuously welded rail]] has a uniform top profile even at the joints.\n\n=== Double-headed rail ===\n[[File:Double-headed_rail.jpg|thumb|right|Double-headed rail on the [[Mid-Norfolk Railway]].]]\nIn late 1830s Britain, railway lines had a vast range of different patterns. One of the earliest lines to use double-headed rail was the [[London and Birmingham Railway]], which had offered a prize for the best design. This rail was supported by [[Chair (railway)|chairs]] and the head and foot of the rail had the same profile. The supposed advantage was that, when the head became worn, the rail could be turned over and re-used. In practice, this form of recycling was not very successful as the chair caused dents in the lower surface, and double-headed rail evolved into bullhead rail in which the head was more substantial than the foot.\n\n=== Bullhead rail ===\nBullhead rail was the standard for the British railway system from the mid-19th until the mid-20th century. For example, in 1954 bullhead rail was used for {{convert|449|mi}} of new track and flat-bottom for {{convert|923|mi}}.<ref>{{cite magazine |magazine=The Railway Magazine |date=June 1954 |page=433 |editor-first=B.W.C. |editor-last=Cooke |publisher=Tothill Press |location=Westminster |number=638 |volume=100 |title=B.R. Track Renewal Programme }}</ref> One of the first [[British Standards]], BS 9, was for bullhead rail - it was originally published in 1905, and revised in 1924.  Rails manufactured to the 1905 standard were referred to as \"O.B.S.\" (Original), and those manufactured to the 1924 standard as \"R.B.S.\" (Revised).<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.valleysignals.org.nz/railbrands/railbrands.html |title=Handbook For Permanent Way Staff |year=1958 |work=Rail Brands |accessdate=13 September 2010 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110723143905/http://www.valleysignals.org.nz/railbrands/railbrands.html |archivedate=23 July 2011  }}</ref>\n\nBullhead rail is similar to double-headed rail except that the profile of the head of the rail is not the same as that of the foot. Bullhead rail evolved from double-headed rail but, because it did not have a symmetrical profile, it was never possible to flip it over and use the foot as the head. Therefore, because the rail no longer had the originally-perceived benefit of reusability, it was a very expensive method of laying track. Heavy cast iron [[Rail chair|chairs]] were needed to support the rail, which was secured in the chairs by wooden (later steel) wedges or \"keys\" which required regular attention.\n\nBullhead rail has now been almost completely replaced by flat-bottom rail on British railways, although it survives on the national rail system in some [[Rail siding|sidings]] or branch lines. It can also be found on [[heritage railways]], due both to the desire to maintain an historic appearance, and the salvage and reuse of old track components from the main lines. The [[London Underground]] continued to use bullhead rail after it had been phased out elsewhere in Britain, but in the last few years has there been a concerted effort to convert its track to flat-bottom rail.<ref>{{cite web|title=London Underground Track and Traction Current|url=http://www.trainweb.org/tubeprune/tractioncurr.htm|publisher=The Tubeprune|accessdate=22 March 2013|url-status =live|archiveurl =https://web.archive.org/web/20120924051652/http://www.trainweb.org/tubeprune/tractioncurr.htm|archivedate= 24 September 2012}}</ref> However, the process of replacing track in tunnels is a slow process due to the impossibility of using heavy plant and machinery.\n\n=== Grooved rail ===\n{{See also|Tramway track#Grooved rail}}\n[[File:Szyny G\u0142ogowska RB2.JPG|thumb|right|upright|Cross section of a grooved tram rail]]\n[[File:TreinTramwielprofiel.svg|thumb|right|Difference in form and profile of the wheel and the rail of a train (left, blue) and a [[tram]] (right, green).]]\n\nWhere a rail is laid in a [[Road surface]] (pavement) or within grassed surfaces, there has to be accommodation for the flange.  This is provided by a [[Groove (engineering)|slot]] called the flangeway.  The rail is then known as '''grooved rail''', '''groove rail''', or '''girder rail'''.  The flangeway has the railhead on one side and the guard on the other.  The guard carries no weight, but may act as a checkrail.\n\nGrooved rail was invented in 1852 by [[Alphonse Loubat]], a French inventor who developed improvements in [[tram]] and rail equipment, and helped develop tram lines in New York City and Paris.  The invention of grooved rail enabled tramways to be laid without causing a nuisance to other road users, except unsuspecting cyclists, who could get their wheels caught in the groove.  The grooves may become filled with gravel and dirt (particularly if infrequently used or after a period of idleness) and need clearing from time to time, this being done by a \"scrubber\" tram.  Failure to clear the grooves can lead to a bumpy ride for the passengers, damage to either wheel or rail and possibly derailing.\n\nA modern grooved rail is the LR55 which is polyurethane grouted into a prefabricated concrete beam set in the grooves cut into an existing asphalt road bed for ULT Ultra Light Rail (trams).{{cite web|url=http://www.bathtram.org/tfb/LR55.gif |title=LR55 rail in comparison with a British Standard B.R.3 tramway rail}}\n\n====Girder guard rail====\nThe traditional form of grooved rail is the girder guard section illustrated to the right.  This rail is a modified form of flanged rail and requires a special mounting for weight transfer and gauge stabilisation.  If the weight is carried by the roadway subsurface, steel ties are needed at regular intervals to maintain the gauge.  Installing these means that the whole surface needs to be excavated and reinstated.\n\n====Block rail====\nBlock rail is a lower profile form of girder guard rail with the web eliminated.  In profile it is more like a solid form of bridge rail, with a flangeway and guard added.  Simply removing the web and combining the head section directly with the foot section would result in a weak rail, so additional thickness is required in the combined section.<ref>{{webarchive| url= https://web.archive.org/web/20131004231441/http://www.skelton-metals.com/railsections_eurogirderguardrail.htm |title=Grooved or girder rail }}</ref>\n\n== Rail lengths ==\n{{main|Rail lengths}}\nRails should be made as long as possible since joints between raillengths are a source of weakness.  As manufacturing processes have improved, rail lengths have increased.
