His father was a [[Vicar (Anglicanism)|Church of England vicar]], and the family lived adjacent to the father's church \u2013 first in [[Ormond, Victoria|Ormond]], then later in [[Ashburton, Victoria|Ashburton]]. Harvey sang in the [[church choir]] from an early age.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.last.fm/music/Mick+Harvey/+wiki|title=Mick Harvey\u2019s Biography \u2014 Free listening, videos, concerts, stats and photos at Last.fm|website=Last.fm|accessdate=1 December 2017}}</ref>\n\nHarvey, his elder brother Philip, and younger brother Sebastian all attended the private boys' school [[Caulfield Grammar School]].

The band played at parties and school functions, with a repertoire of [[Lou Reed]], [[David Bowie]], [[Roxy Music]], [[Alice Cooper]] and the [[Sensational Alex Harvey Band]], among others. Harvey was also a member of the school choir (conducted by actor [[Norman Kaye]]), and took extracurricular lessons from [[Bruce Clarke (musician)|Bruce Clarke]], the [[jazz guitar]]ist.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mickharvey.com/biography.php|title=Mick Harvey - Biography|website=www.mickharvey.com|accessdate=1 December 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171115181727/http://www.mickharvey.com/biography.php|archive-date=15 November 2017|url-status=dead|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\n==Music career==\n\n===The Birthday Party===\n{{Main|The Birthday Party (band)}}\nAfter their final school year in 1975, the band decided to continue with Pew as bassist. Greatly influenced by the [[punk rock|punk]] explosion of 1976, which saw Australian bands [[The Saints (Australian band)|The Saints]] and [[Radio Birdman]] make their first recordings and tours, [[The Birthday Party (band)#The Boys Next Door|The Boys Next Door]], as Harvey's band was now called, began performing fast, original [[New wave music|new wave]] material.<ref>[https://www.discogs.com/artist/78466-The-Boys-Next-Door Discogs - ''The Boys Next Door'' - Aliases, Members, Discography]</ref> Harvey's guitar style was influenced by [[James Williamson (musician)|James Williamson]] of [[The Stooges]] and [[Paul Weller (singer)|Paul Weller]] of [[The Jam]]. The Boys Next Door regularly played at Melbourne pubs between 1977 and 1980. [[Rowland S. Howard]] joined the band in 1978, bringing with him a chaotic [[audio feedback|feedback]] guitar style.\n\nAfter extensive touring, recordings, and moderate success in Australia, the Boys Next Door relocated to [[London]], England in 1980, and changed their name to The Birthday Party. This period was defined by innovative and aggressive music composition, underpinned by Harvey's guitar playing.\n\nHarvey's girlfriend Katy Beale followed the band to London.\n\n===Crime and the City Solution===\n''Main article: [[Crime & the City Solution]]''\n\nAfter the breakup of The Birthday Party while initiating the early recordings of what would become The Bad Seeds with Nick Cave, Harvey contacted his friend [[Simon Bonney]], with whom he reformed Bonney's old Australian band [[Crime & the City Solution]]. Rowland S. Howard, [[Harry Howard (musician)|Harry Howard]] (bass) and Epic Soundtracks (drums), all of whom a few years later would form the basis of [[These Immortal Souls]], also participated. This line-up of the band found its peak and demise with its appearance in the [[Wim Wenders]] film [[Wings of Desire]]. Bonney then stayed in Berlin and formed the next line-up of the band with his partner [[Bronwyn Adams]], Harvey (drums), [[Alexander Hacke]] of [[Einst\u00fcrzende Neubauten]] (guitar), [[Chrislo Haas]] of [[Liaisons Dangereuses (band)|Liaisons Dangereuses]] and DAF (synthesiser) and Thomas Stern (bass). This line-up made 3 studio albums and toured until 1991.\n\n=== Nick Cave and The Bad Seeds ===\n''Main article: [[Nick Cave and the Bad Seeds]]''\n\nHarvey and Cave formed Nick Cave and The Bad Seeds in 1983. Harvey was principally the drummer on the first 2 albums before line-up changes saw him move to the bass until the arrival of [[Martyn P. Casey]] in 1990 when he moved back to his original instrument, guitar. Throughout the 80s and 90 Harvey was the band member charged with the responsibility for the production of the recordings along with Cave. His arrangement skills also saw him putting together most of the band\u2019s string arrangements during this time and led to the perception of him as a kind of musical director. He also managed much of the band\u2019s business affairs right up until his departure. Harvey remained with the Bad Seeds for 25 years until his his last show in Perth, Australia on 20 January 2009, when he cited both professional and personal factors as reasons for leaving.<sup>[5]</sup> Regarding Cave, Harvey informed the media: <blockquote>\nI'm confident Nick [Cave] will continue to be a creative force and that this is the right time to pass on my artistic and managerial role to what has become a tremendous group of people who can support him in his endeavours, both musically and organisationally.<ref name=\"Quit\">{{cite news|url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/stories/2009/01/22/2472215.htm?section=entertainment|title=Bad Seeds co-founder Harvey quits|date=23 January 2009|work=ABC News|accessdate=28 August 2014}}</ref></blockquote>\n\nIn 2010, Harvey explained further that his frustration with song arrangements strained his relationship with Cave; and a desire to spend time with family was also a significant reason for his decision. The split marked the end of a 36-year-long collaboration between Harvey and Cave.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://meltingpod.free.fr/?p=214|title=Podcast 103 Live interview with Mick Harvey in Paris 2010 : some reasons to have left the band Nick Cave and The Bad Seeds\u2026Part 2 (25\u2032)|author1=Mardi|date=2 March 2010|website=Meltingpod|publisher=Meltingpod|format=Audio file|accessdate=28 August 2014}}</ref>\n\n=== '''Anita Lane''' ===\n''Main article: [[Anita Lane]]''\n\nHarvey worked extensively with Nick Cave\u2019s muse and partner of many years on two albums - Dirty Pearl (1993 ) and Sex O\u2019Clock (200)\n\n===The Wallbangers===\nIn 2007, the Spanish label [[Bang!

Records (BANG!-21) Spain]</ref> featuring songs written by Harvey alone, and songs he co-wote with [[Tex Perkins]] and [[Loene Carmen]].

Howard ===\n''Main article: [[Pop Crimes]]'' \n\nDuring 2008 and 2009 Harvey worked on what would be [[Rowland S. Howard]]\u2019s last album \u2018Pop Crimes\u2019 playing drums with his future close collaborator J.P. Shilo providing bass and violin. The album was released just a few months before Howard succumbed to liver cancer in late 2009.\n\n===Solo===\nAfter Bonney left Crime & the City Solution for a solo career in the United States, Harvey recorded two solo albums of [[Serge Gainsbourg]] songs, translated from French into English: ''[[Intoxicated Man]]'' (1995) and ''[[Pink Elephants]]'' (1997). He has also collaborated with UK rock musician [[PJ Harvey]] (no relation), and produced for other Australian artists, including [[Anita Lane]], [[Robert Forster (musician)|Robert Forster]], [[Conway Savage]] and Rowland S. Howard. Harvey's third solo release, ''[[One Man's Treasure]]'', was issued in September 2005.\n\nHe undertook his first solo tours of Europe and Australia in 2006, accompanied by fellow Bad Seeds [[Thomas Wydler]] and [[James Johnston (English musician)|James Johnston]], as well as Melbourne-based double bassist Rosie Westbrook.

His father was a [[Vicar (Anglicanism)|Church of England vicar]], and the family lived adjacent to the father's church \u2013 first in [[Ormond, Victoria|Ormond]], then later in [[Ashburton, Victoria|Ashburton]]. Harvey sang in the [[church choir]] from an early age.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.last.fm/music/Mick+Harvey/+wiki|title=Mick Harvey\u2019s Biography \u2014 Free listening, videos, concerts, stats and photos at Last.fm|website=Last.fm|accessdate=1 December 2017}}</ref>\n\nHarvey, his elder brother Philip, and younger brother Sebastian all attended the private boys' school [[Caulfield Grammar School]]. It was at school in the early 1970s that Harvey met fellow students Cave and [[Phill Calvert]], as well as [[Tracy Pew]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/2008/feb/23/popandrock.features|title=Interview with Nick Cave|first=Interview by Simon|last=Hattenstone|date=23 February 2008|publisher=|accessdate=1 December 2017|via=www.theguardian.com}}</ref> A rock group was formed with Cave (vocals), Harvey (guitar), Calvert (drums), and other students on guitar, bass and saxophone. The band played at parties and school functions, with a repertoire of [[Lou Reed]], [[David Bowie]], [[Roxy Music]], [[Alice Cooper]] and the [[Sensational Alex Harvey Band]], among others. Harvey was also a member of the school choir (conducted by actor [[Norman Kaye]]), and took extracurricular lessons from [[Bruce Clarke (musician)|Bruce Clarke]], the [[jazz guitar]]ist.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mickharvey.com/biography.php|title=Mick Harvey - Biography|website=www.mickharvey.com|accessdate=1 December 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171115181727/http://www.mickharvey.com/biography.php|archive-date=15 November 2017|url-status=dead|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\n==Music career==\n\n===The Birthday Party===\n{{Main|The Birthday Party (band)}}\nAfter their final school year in 1975, the band decided to continue with Pew as bassist. Greatly influenced by the [[punk rock|punk]] explosion of 1976, which saw Australian bands [[The Saints (Australian band)|The Saints]] and [[Radio Birdman]] make their first recordings and tours, [[The Birthday Party (band)#The Boys Next Door|The Boys Next Door]], as Harvey's band was now called, began performing fast, original [[New wave music|new wave]] material.<ref>[https://www.discogs.com/artist/78466-The-Boys-Next-Door Discogs - ''The Boys Next Door'' - Aliases, Members, Discography]</ref> Harvey's guitar style was influenced by [[James Williamson (musician)|James Williamson]] of [[The Stooges]] and [[Paul Weller (singer)|Paul Weller]] of [[The Jam]]. The Boys Next Door regularly played at Melbourne pubs between 1977 and 1980. [[Rowland S. Howard]] joined the band in 1978, bringing with him a chaotic [[audio feedback|feedback]] guitar style.\n\nAfter extensive touring, recordings, and moderate success in Australia, the Boys Next Door relocated to [[London]], England in 1980, and changed their name to The Birthday Party. This period was defined by innovative and aggressive music composition, underpinned by Harvey's guitar playing.\n\nHarvey's girlfriend Katy Beale followed the band to London.\n\n===Crime and the City Solution===\n''Main article: [[Crime & the City Solution]]''\n\nAfter the breakup of The Birthday Party while initiating the early recordings of what would become The Bad Seeds with Nick Cave, Harvey contacted his friend [[Simon Bonney]], with whom he reformed Bonney's old Australian band [[Crime & the City Solution]]. Rowland S. Howard, [[Harry Howard (musician)|Harry Howard]] (bass) and Epic Soundtracks (drums), all of whom a few years later would form the basis of [[These Immortal Souls]], also participated. This line-up of the band found its peak and demise with its appearance in the [[Wim Wenders]] film [[Wings of Desire]]. Bonney then stayed in Berlin and formed the next line-up of the band with his partner [[Bronwyn Adams]], Harvey (drums), [[Alexander Hacke]] of [[Einst\u00fcrzende Neubauten]] (guitar), [[Chrislo Haas]] of [[Liaisons Dangereuses (band)|Liaisons Dangereuses]] and DAF (synthesiser) and Thomas Stern (bass). This line-up made 3 studio albums and toured until 1991.\n\n=== Nick Cave and The Bad Seeds ===\n''Main article: [[Nick Cave and the Bad Seeds]]''\n\nHarvey and Cave formed Nick Cave and The Bad Seeds in 1983. Harvey was principally the drummer on the first 2 albums before line-up changes saw him move to the bass until the arrival of Martyn P. Casey in 1990 when he moved back to his original instrument, guitar. Throughout the 80s and 90 Harvey was the band member charged with the responsibility for the production of the recordings along with Cave. His arrangement skills also saw him putting together most of the band\u2019s string arrangements during this time and led to the perception of him as a kind of musical director. He also managed much of the band\u2019s business affairs right up until his departure. Harvey remained with the Bad Seeds for 25 years until his his last show in Perth, Australia on 20 January 2009, when he cited both professional and personal factors as reasons for leaving.<sup>[5]</sup> Regarding Cave, Harvey informed the media: <blockquote>\nI'm confident Nick [Cave] will continue to be a creative force and that this is the right time to pass on my artistic and managerial role to what has become a tremendous group of people who can support him in his endeavours, both musically and organisationally.<ref name=\"Quit\">{{cite news|url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/stories/2009/01/22/2472215.htm?section=entertainment|title=Bad Seeds co-founder Harvey quits|date=23 January 2009|work=ABC News|accessdate=28 August 2014}}</ref></blockquote>\n\nIn 2010, Harvey explained further that his frustration with song arrangements strained his relationship with Cave; and a desire to spend time with family was also a significant reason for his decision.

Howard ===\n''Main article: [[Pop Crimes]]'' \n\nDuring 2008 and 2009 Harvey worked on what would be [[Rowland S. Howard]]\u2019s last album \u2018Pop Crimes\u2019 playing drums with his future close collaborator J.P. Shilo providing bass and violin. The album was released just a few months before Howard succumbed to liver cancer in late 2009.\n\n===Solo===\nAfter Bonney left Crime & the City Solution for a solo career in the United States, Harvey recorded two solo albums of [[Serge Gainsbourg]] songs, translated from French into English: ''[[Intoxicated Man]]'' (1995) and ''[[Pink Elephants]]'' (1997). He has also collaborated with UK rock musician [[PJ Harvey]] (no relation), and produced for other Australian artists, including [[Anita Lane]], [[Robert Forster (musician)|Robert Forster]], [[Conway Savage]] and Rowland S. Howard. Harvey's third solo release, ''[[One Man's Treasure]]'', was issued in September 2005.\n\nHe undertook his first solo tours of Europe and Australia in 2006, accompanied by fellow Bad Seeds [[Thomas Wydler]] and [[James Johnston (English musician)|James Johnston]], as well as Melbourne-based double bassist Rosie Westbrook.
