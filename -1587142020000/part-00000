Schulz]] based on the ''[[Peanuts]]'' [[comic strip]]. The film marks the on-screen debut of [[Woodstock (Peanuts)|Woodstock]], who had first appeared in the strip in 1967. It was the only Peanuts film during composer [[Vince Guaraldi]]\u2019s lifetime that did not have a score composed by him. Its music was composed by the [[Sherman Brothers]], who composed the music for various [[The Walt Disney Company|Disney]] films like ''[[Mary Poppins (1964 film)|Mary Poppins]]'' (1964), ''[[The Jungle Book (1967 film)|The Jungle Book]]'' (1967), and ''[[Bedknobs and Broomsticks]]'' (1971). The film was released on August 9, 1972 by [[National General Pictures]], produced by [[Lee Mendelson Films]] and [[Cinema Center Films]] (in the latter's final production).\n\n==Plot==\n<!-- NOTICE: Per WP:FILMPLOT, plot summaries in film articles should be 400-700 words. -->\n[[Snoopy]] and the rest of the ''[[Peanuts]]'' gang go to the beach for the day. Once there, Snoopy promises to go back to the beach the next day to meet up with [[Peppermint Patty]]. After [[Charlie Brown]] has gone home to play ''[[Monopoly (game)|Monopoly]]'' with the others, he notices Snoopy is late and remarks he is tired of Snoopy being late. Charlie Brown vents his frustrations at Snoopy, who silences him by taking off his collar. The next day, Snoopy is thrown off the beach due to a new \"No Dogs Allowed on this beach\" rule (thus setting a running gag in the film). Then Snoopy gets thrown out of a library due to his disruptive behavior and another \"No Dogs Allowed in library\" rule. He then takes out his anger by getting into a fight with [[Linus van Pelt|Linus]] over his blanket, and later beats [[Lucy van Pelt|Lucy]] in a boxing match.\n\nLater, Snoopy receives a letter from a girl named [[List of minor characters in Peanuts#Lillian \"Lila\" Emmons Allcroft|Lila]], who has been in the hospital for three weeks for unspecified reasons and needs Snoopy to keep her company. Upon receiving the letter, Snoopy immediately sets off with [[Woodstock (Peanuts)|Woodstock]] to go see her, leaving Charlie Brown completely in the dark as to who Lila is. Linus decides to do some investigating, and discovers that Lila is Snoopy's original owner; Charlie Brown faints upon hearing this.  Lila and Snoopy were great friends and found out they can't keep Snoopy anymore they had to take him back to Daisy Hill Puppy Farm.  When Lila was in the hospital and Snoopy decided to go visit her. \n\nEn route to see Lila, Snoopy and Woodstock are forced to face the challenges of a world full of signs declaring \"No Dogs Allowed.\" Each instance - on a bus, a train, and elsewhere - is musically accented by the deep tones of [[Thurl Ravenscroft]]. The pair are briefly adopted as pets by an [[List of minor characters in Peanuts#Clara|animal-obsessed girl]] (identified as Clara in the theatrical poster, the soundtrack album's back cover and label, and [[closed captioning]]), and she ties Snoopy up. Then Clara locks Woodstock in a cage while he's trying to save Snoopy. Clara's mother lets her keep the beagle; Clara is so excited to have Snoopy (whom she calls \"Rex\") as her \"sheepdog\". She bathes him (and he tries to escape, but fails) and dresses him up. Clara starts a tea party, but Snoopy escapes Clara's clutches and tries to call for help, but Clara catches him, takes his dress off, and ties him up again. Then Clara tells Snoopy, \"Mom says, if I'm gonna keep you, I gotta take you to the vet for a check up. You probably need about a dozen shots.\" \nClara walks Snoopy to the vet and when they get there, he causes a fight and escapes.  He returns to Clara's house and frees Woodstock, but Clara returns and a chases ensues until she ends up with a full fishbowl stuck on her head, prompting their escape.  Later that evening, Snoopy and Woodstock camp out, play football and make music while preparing dinner.\n\nSnoopy finally reaches the hospital, but again no dogs are allowed inside. To add further insult, the hospital does not allow birds to enter either. Snoopy is foiled in his first attempt to sneak into Lila's room, but his second attempt is successful. He then keeps Lila company for the rest of his stay. Lila tells Snoopy that his visit helped her to get better. She then asks Snoopy to go home with her, but he has doubts about this idea. Snoopy decides to go back home to Charlie Brown. However, when he sees Lila watching him tearfully from her hospital window,  Snoopy finds that it's too hard to leave her and he runs back to her, which she takes as a sign that he wants to live with her. But first, he needs to return to \"settle his affairs\" and say goodbye. Snoopy writes a letter directing that certain items of his will be given away: Linus is given his croquet and chess sets, while [[Schroeder (Peanuts)|Schroeder]] receives Snoopy's record collection.\n\nThe kids throw Snoopy a large, tearful going-away party, each one bringing a gift. The kids closest to Snoopy get up to say a few words in his honor. But when it is Charlie Brown's turn to speak, he is overwhelmed to the point of silence. After giving Snoopy his present, he finally wails out in pain with Snoopy doing likewise. The rest of the gang, even Lucy, eventually follows suit when Schroeder plays \"[[It's a Long Way to Tipperary]]\" on his piano.\n\nAfter Snoopy leaves, Charlie Brown is unable to sleep or eat. When Snoopy arrives at Lila's apartment building the next day, he sees a sign next to the front door that says \"No dogs allowed in this building\". Snoopy is overjoyed that this gives him an excuse to return to Charlie Brown.  Lila arrives and Snoopy is reluctantly introduced to her pet cat. Snoopy shows Lila the sign, and Lila has no choice but to allow Snoopy to leave.  Snoopy leaves Lila behind and joyfully returns to Charlie Brown and the others.\n\nBack home, the children are overjoyed to see Snoopy return, carrying him on high to his dog house. Once there, using his typewriter, Snoopy demands that the kids return the items he had given them before he left, turning their feelings to annoyance. Charlie Brown reads his document and tells the gang, \"Mine says, that since he gave me ''nothing'', I owe ''him'' nothing.\"\nLucy then snaps, \"That does it, Charlie Brown! He's ''your'' dog ''and you're welcome to him''!\" \nThe gang then leaves Charlie Brown and Snoopy together, then Charlie Brown walks crossly away.

Patton and Stephen Mitchell have seen in the Gita a religious defense of the warrior class's ([[Kshatriya]] [[Varna (Hinduism)|Varna]]) duty (''svadharma''), which is to conduct combat and [[war]] with courage and do not see this as only an allegorical teaching, but also a real defense of [[just war]].<ref>Rosen, Steven; Krishna's Song: A New Look at the Bhagavad Gita, p. 22.</ref><ref>Patton, Laurie L.; The Failure of Allegory in ''Fighting Words''</ref>\n\nIndian independence leaders like [[Lala Lajpat Rai]] and [[Bal Gangadhar Tilak]] saw the Gita as a text which defended war when necessary and used it to promote war against the British Empire. Lajpat Rai wrote an article on the \"Message of the Bhagavad Gita\". He saw the main message as the bravery and courage of Arjuna to fight as a warrior.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">{{harvnb|M.V.

''[[\u0100tman (Hinduism)|\u0100tman]]'' (Soul) and Self-knowledge, along with the loss of egotistic ignorance, the goal of ''moksha'', is something that is always present as the essence of the self, and must be realized by each person by one's own effort. While the [[Upanishads]] largely uphold such a monistic viewpoint of liberation, the ''Bhagavad Gita'' also accommodates the dualistic and theistic aspects of ''moksha''. The ''Gita'', while including impersonal ''Nirguna Brahman'' as the goal, mainly revolves around the relationship between the Self and a personal God or ''[[Saguna Brahman]]''. A synthesis of knowledge, devotion, and desireless action is offered by Krishna as a spectrum of choices to Arjuna; the same combination is suggested to the reader as a way to moksha.<ref>{{harvnb|Fowler|2012|pages=xlv\u2013xlviii}}</ref> Christopher Chapple \u2013 a Comparative Theology scholar focusing on Indian religions, in [[Winthrop Sargeant]] translation of the ''Gita'', states, \"In the model presented by the ''Bhagavad G\u012bt\u0101'', every aspect of life is in fact a way of salvation.\"{{sfn|Sargeant|2009|pages=xxii\u2013xxiii}}\n\n===Pancaratra Agama===\nAccording to Dennis Hudson, there is an overlap between Vedic and Tantric rituals with the teachings found in the ''Bhagavad Gita''.{{sfn|Hudson|2002|pp=9, 160\u2013163}} He places the ''Pancaratra Agama'' in the last three or four centuries of 1st-millennium BCE, and proposes that both the tantric and vedic, the Agama and the Gita share the same Vasudeva-Krishna roots.{{sfn|Hudson|2002|p=133}} Some of the ideas in the ''Bhagavad Gita'' connect it to the ''Shatapatha Brahmana'' of ''[[Yajurveda]]''. The ''Shatapatha Brahmana'', for example, mentions the absolute Purusha who dwells in every human being. A story in this vedic text, states Hudson, highlights the meaning of the name Vasudeva as the 'shining one (deva) who dwells (vasu) in all things and in whom all things dwell', and the meaning of Vishnu to be the 'pervading actor'.

He is advised by Krishna to do his ''sva-dharma'', a term that has been variously interpreted. According to the Indologist Paul Hacker, the contextual meaning in the ''Gita'' is the \"dharma of a particular varna\".{{sfn|Hacker|Halbfass|1995|p=264}} Neo-Hindus such as Bankim Chandra Chatterjee, states Hacker, have preferred to not translate it in those terms, or \"dharma\" as religion, but leave ''Gita's'' message as \"everyone must follow his ''sva-dharma''\".{{sfn|Hacker|Halbfass|1995|pp=261\u2013262}} According to Chatterjee, the Hindus already understand the meaning of that term. To render it in English for non-Hindus for its better understanding, one must ask ''what is the sva-dharma for the non-Hindus''? The Lord, states Chatterjee, created millions and millions of people, and he did not ordain ''dharma'' only for Indians [Hindus] and \"make all the others dharma-less\", for \"are not the non-Hindus also his children\"? According to Chatterjee, the Krishna's religion of ''Gita'' is \"not so narrow-minded\".{{sfn|Hacker|Halbfass|1995|pp=261\u2013262}} This argument, states Hacker, is an attempt to \"universalize Hinduism\".{{sfn|Hacker|Halbfass|1995|pp=261\u2013262}}\n\nThe ''Gita'' has been cited and criticized as a Hindu text that supports ''varna-dharma'' and the caste system.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Olcott |first=Mason |title=The Caste System of India |journal=American Sociological Review | publisher=Sage Publications | volume=9 |issue=6 |year=1944 |doi=10.2307/2085128 |pages=648\u2013657|jstor=2085128 }}</ref><ref>{{cite book|author=Susan Bayly|title=Caste, Society and Politics in India from the Eighteenth Century to the Modern Age| url=https://books.google.com/books?id=HbAjKR_iHogC | year=2001| publisher=Cambridge University Press| isbn=978-0-521-79842-6| pages=13\u201314}}</ref>{{sfn|Maitra|2018|p=22}} [[B.

P. Blavatsky, Subba Rao and Anne Besant writings.{{sfn|Minor|1986|pp=11\u201314}} Their attempt was to present their \"universalist religion\". These late 19th-century theosophical writings called the ''Gita'' as a \"path of true spirituality\" and \"teaching nothing more than the basis of every system of philosophy and scientific endeavor\", triumphing over other \"Samkhya paths\" of Hinduism that \"have degenerated into superstition and demoralized India by leading people away from practical action\".{{sfn|Minor|1986|pp=11\u201314}}\n\n====Political violence====\nIn the ''Gita'', Krishna persuades Arjuna to wage war where the enemy includes some of his own relatives and friends. In light of the ''[[Ahimsa]]'' (non-violence) teachings in Hindu scriptures, the ''Gita'' has been criticized as violating the ''Ahimsa'' value, or alternatively, as supporting political violence.{{sfn|Minor|1986|pp=65\u201373}} The justification of political violence when peaceful protests and all else fails, states Varma, has been a \"fairly common feature of modern Indian political thought\" along with the \"mighty antithesis of Gandhian thought on non-violence\". During the freedom movement in India, Hindus considered active \"burning and drowning of British goods\" which technically illegal under the colonial laws, were viewed as a moral and [[Just war theory|just-war]] for the sake of liberty and righteous values of the type ''Gita'' discusses.<ref name=\"Varma1990p232\">{{cite book|author=Vishwanath Prasad Varma|title=The Political Philosophy of Sri Aurobindo|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=bLrp0c0hizAC |year=1990|publisher=Motilal Banarsidass|isbn=978-81-208-0686-3|pages=232\u2013235}}</ref> According to Paul Schaffel the influential Hindu nationalist [[Vinayak Damodar Savarkar|V.D.

Wesleyan University, 2012, p. 38.</ref>\n\nMahatma Gandhi credited his commitment for ''ahimsa'' to the ''Gita''. For Gandhi, the ''Gita'' is teaching that people should fight for justice and righteous values, that they should never meekly suffer injustice to avoid a war. According to the Indologist Ananya Vajpeyi, the ''Gita'' does not elaborate on the means or stages of war, nor on ''ahimsa'', except for stating that \"''ahimsa'' is virtuous and characterizes an awakened, steadfast, ethical man\" in verses such as 13.7\u201310 and 16.1\u20135.<ref name=\"Vajpeyi2012p66\">{{cite book|author=Ananya Vajpeyi|title=Righteous Republic: The Political Foundations of Modern India |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=knCDsvJYy1EC&pg=PA66 |year=2012|publisher=Harvard University Press |isbn=978-0-674-06728-8|pages=66\u201367}}</ref> For Gandhi, states Vajpeyi, ''ahimsa'' is the \"relationship between self and other\" while he and his fellow Indians battled against the colonial rule. Gandhian ahimsa is in fact \"the essence of the entire ''Gita''\", according to Vajpeyi.<ref name=\"Vajpeyi2012p66\"/> The teachings of the ''Gita'' on ''ahimsa'' are ambiguous, states Arvind Sharma, and this is best exemplified by the fact that Nathuram Godse stated the ''Gita'' as his inspiration to do his ''dharma'' after he [[Assassination of Mahatma Gandhi|assassinated Mahatma Gandhi]].{{sfn|Sharma|1986|pp=xiv\u2013xv}} [[Thomas Merton]], the Trappist monk and author of books on Zen Buddhism, concurs with Gandhi and states that the ''Gita'' is not teaching violence nor propounding a \"make war\" ideology. Instead, it is teaching peace and discussing one's duty to examine what is right and then act with pure intentions, when one's faces difficult and repugnant choices.{{sfn|Miller|1986|pp=149\u2013150}}\n\n=== Largest copy ===\nThe world's largest Bhagavad Gita is in the [[ISKCON Temple Delhi]], which claims to be the world's largest sacred book of any religion.

The term ''dharma'' has a number of meanings.{{sfn|Fowler|2012|p=2}} Fundamentally, it means \"what is right\".{{sfn|Fowler|2012|p=2}} Contexually, it also means the essence of \"duty, law, class, social norms, ritual and cosmos itself\" in the text, in the sense \"the way things should be in all these different dimensions\", states Fowler.{{sfn|Fowler|2012|p=2}} According to Zaehner, the term ''dharma'' means \"duty\" in Gita's context, in verse 2.7 refers to the \"right [and wrong]\", and in 14.27 to \"eternal law of righteousness\".{{sfn|Zaehner|1969|pp=123, 382}}\n\nFew verses in the ''Bhagavad Gita'' deal with ''dharma'', according to the Indologist Paul Hacker, but the theme of ''dharma'' is important in it.{{sfn|Hacker|Halbfass|1995|p=260}} In Chapter 1, responding to [[Arjuna|Arjuna's]] despondency, [[Krishna]] asks him to follow his ''sva-dharma'',{{sfn|Hacker|1958|pp=1\u201315}} \"the ''dharma'' that belongs to a particular man (Arjuna) as a member of a particular ''[[Varna (Hinduism)|varna]]'', (i.e., the ''kshatriya'' \u2013 the warrior varna)\".{{sfn|Hacker||1958|p=261}} According to Paul Hacker, the term ''dharma'' has additional meanings in the context of Arjuna. It is more broadly, the \"duty\" and a \"metaphysically congealed act\" for Arjuna.{{sfn|Hacker|Halbfass|1995|p=261}} According to the Indologist Jacqueline Hirst, the ''dharma'' theme is \"of significance only at the beginning and end of the ''Gita''\" and this may have been a way to perhaps link the ''Gita'' to the context of the ''Mahabharata''.<ref name=\"Hirst1997p48\">{{cite book|author=Jacqueline Hirst|editor=Julius Lipner|title=The Fruits of Our Desiring: An Enquiry Into the Ethics of the Bhagavadg\u012bt\u0101 for Our Times |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=tk9YBPOl36UC&pg=PA48|year=1997|publisher=Bayeux|isbn=978-1-896209-30-2|page=48}}</ref>\n\nAccording to Malinar, \"Arjuna's crisis and some of the arguments put forward to call him to action are connected to the debates on war and peace in the ''[[Udyoga Parva]]''.\"{{sfn|Malinar|2007|p=36}} The ''Udyoga Parva'' presents many views about the nature of a warrior, his duty and what calls for heroic action. While [[Duryodhana]] presents it as a matter of status, social norms, and fate, [[Vidura]] states that the heroic warrior never submits, knows no fear and has the duty to protect people.{{sfn|Malinar|2007|pp=36\u201341}} The ''[[Bhishma Parva|Bhishma parva]]'' sets the stage of two ideologies in conflict and two massive armies gathered for what each considers as a righteous and necessary war. In this context, the ''Gita'' advises Arjuna to do his holy duty (''sva-dharma'') as a warrior, fight and kill.{{sfn|Miller|2004|p=3}}{{sfn|Michaels|2004|p=59}}{{sfn|Malinar|2007|pp=36\u201339}}\n\nAccording to the Indologist Barbara Miller, the text frames heroism not in terms of physical abilities, but instead in terms of effort and inner commitment to fulfill a warrior's ''dharma'' in the battlefield.{{sfn| Miller|1986|pp=1\u20138}} War is depicted as a horror, the impending slaughter a cause of self-doubts, yet at stake is the spiritual struggle against evil.{{sfn| Miller|1986|pp=1\u20138}} The ''Gita'' message emphasizes that the personal moral confusion and struggle must be addressed, the warrior needs to rise beyond \"personal and social values\" and understand what is at stake and \"why he must fight\", states Miller. The text explores the \"paradoxical interconnectedness of disciplined action and freedom\".{{sfn| Miller|1986|pp=1\u20138}}\n\n==== ''The Field of Dharma'' ====\nThe first reference to ''dharma'' in the ''Bhagavad Gita'' occurs in its first verse, where [[Dhritarashtra]] refers to the Kurukshetra, the location of the battlefield, as the ''Field of Dharma'', \"The Field of Righteousness or Truth\".{{sfn|Fowler|2012|p=2}} According to Fowler, ''dharma'' in this verse may refer to the ''[[sanatana dharma]]'', \"what Hindus understand as their religion, for it is a term that encompasses wide aspects of religious and traditional thought and is more readily used for religion\".{{sfn|Fowler|2012|p=2}} Therefore, 'Field of action' implies the field of righteousness, where truth will eventually triumph, states Fowler.{{sfn|Fowler|2012|p=2}} According to Jacqueline Hirst, the \"field of ''dharma''\" phrase in the ''Gita'' epitomizes that the struggle concerns ''dharma'' itself. This ''dharma'' has \"resonances at many different levels\".<ref>{{cite book|author=Jacqueline Hirst|editor=Julius Lipner|title=The Fruits of Our Desiring: An Enquiry Into the Ethics of the Bhagavadg\u012bt\u0101 for Our Times |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=tk9YBPOl36UC&pg=PA48|year=1997|publisher=Bayeux|isbn=978-1-896209-30-2|pages=50\u201358}}</ref>\n\n\"The Field of Dharma\" is also called the \"Field of action\" by [[Sri Aurobindo]], a freedom fighter and philosopher.{{sfn|Fowler|2012|p=2}} [[Sarvapalli Radhakrishnan]], a professor of Philosophy at the Oxford University and the second president of India, saw \"The Field of Dharma\" as the world (Bhavsagar), which is a \"battleground for moral struggle\".<ref>{{harvnb|Fowler|2012|page=2}}</ref>\n\n==== Allegory of war ====\nUnlike any other religious scripture, the ''Bhagavad Gita'' broadcasts its message in the centre of the battlefield.<ref>{{harvnb|Krishnananda|1980|pages=12\u201313}}</ref> Several modern Indian writers have interpreted the battlefield setting as an allegory of \"the war within\".{{sfn|Easwaran|2007|p=15}} [[Eknath Easwaran]] writes that the ''Gita''{{'}}s subject is \"the war within, the struggle for self-mastery that every human being must wage if he or she is to emerge from life victorious\".<ref>{{harvnb|Easwaran|2007|page=15}}</ref>\n\n[[Swami Nikhilananda]], takes Arjuna as an allegory of \u0100tman, Krishna as an allegory of ''[[Brahman]]'', Arjuna's chariot as the body, and Dhritarashtra as the ignorance filled mind.{{refn|group=note|{{harvnb|Nikhilananda|Hocking|2006|page=2}} \"Arjuna represents the individual soul, and Sri Krishna the Supreme Soul dwelling in every heart.

But there is this much of truth in the view, that the setting of the doctrine though not symbolical, is certainly typical.<ref name=\"THD\"/>}}\n\n==== Promotion of [[just war]] and duty ====\nOther scholars such as Steven Rosen, Laurie L. Patton and Stephen Mitchell have seen in the Gita a religious defense of the warrior class's ([[Kshatriya]] [[Varna (Hinduism)|Varna]]) duty (''svadharma''), which is to conduct combat and [[war]] with courage and do not see this as only an allegorical teaching, but also a real defense of [[just war]].<ref>Rosen, Steven; Krishna's Song: A New Look at the Bhagavad Gita, p. 22.</ref><ref>Patton, Laurie L.; The Failure of Allegory in ''Fighting Words''</ref>\n\nIndian independence leaders like [[Lala Lajpat Rai]] and [[Bal Gangadhar Tilak]] saw the Gita as a text which defended war when necessary and used it to promote war against the British Empire. Lajpat Rai wrote an article on the \"Message of the Bhagavad Gita\". He saw the main message as the bravery and courage of Arjuna to fight as a warrior.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">{{harvnb|M.V. Nadkarni|2016|pp=Chapter 4}}</ref> [[Bal Gangadhar Tilak]] saw the Gita as defending killing when necessary for the betterment of society, such as, for example, the killing of [[Afzal Khan (general)|Afzal Khan]].<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/>\n\n=== Moksha: Liberation ===\n{{Main|Moksha}}\nLiberation or ''[[moksha]]'' in [[Vedanta]] philosophy is not something that can be acquired. ''[[\u0100tman (Hinduism)|\u0100tman]]'' (Soul) and Self-knowledge, along with the loss of egotistic ignorance, the goal of ''moksha'', is something that is always present as the essence of the self, and must be realized by each person by one's own effort. While the [[Upanishads]] largely uphold such a monistic viewpoint of liberation, the ''Bhagavad Gita'' also accommodates the dualistic and theistic aspects of ''moksha''. The ''Gita'', while including impersonal ''Nirguna Brahman'' as the goal, mainly revolves around the relationship between the Self and a personal God or ''[[Saguna Brahman]]''. A synthesis of knowledge, devotion, and desireless action is offered by Krishna as a spectrum of choices to Arjuna; the same combination is suggested to the reader as a way to moksha.<ref>{{harvnb|Fowler|2012|pages=xlv\u2013xlviii}}</ref> Christopher Chapple \u2013 a Comparative Theology scholar focusing on Indian religions, in [[Winthrop Sargeant]] translation of the ''Gita'', states, \"In the model presented by the ''Bhagavad G\u012bt\u0101'', every aspect of life is in fact a way of salvation.\"{{sfn|Sargeant|2009|pages=xxii\u2013xxiii}}\n\n===Pancaratra Agama===\nAccording to Dennis Hudson, there is an overlap between Vedic and Tantric rituals with the teachings found in the ''Bhagavad Gita''.{{sfn|Hudson|2002|pp=9, 160\u2013163}} He places the ''Pancaratra Agama'' in the last three or four centuries of 1st-millennium BCE, and proposes that both the tantric and vedic, the Agama and the Gita share the same Vasudeva-Krishna roots.{{sfn|Hudson|2002|p=133}} Some of the ideas in the ''Bhagavad Gita'' connect it to the ''Shatapatha Brahmana'' of ''[[Yajurveda]]''. The ''Shatapatha Brahmana'', for example, mentions the absolute Purusha who dwells in every human being. A story in this vedic text, states Hudson, highlights the meaning of the name Vasudeva as the 'shining one (deva) who dwells (vasu) in all things and in whom all things dwell', and the meaning of Vishnu to be the 'pervading actor'. In Bhagavad Gita, similarly, 'Krishna identified himself both with Vasudeva, Vishnu and their meanings'.{{sfn|Hudson|2002|pp=156\u2013157}}{{refn|group=note|Other parallelism include verse 10.21 of Gita replicating the structure of verse 1.2.5 of the Shatapatha Brahmana.{{sfn|Hudson|2002|p=157}}}} The ideas at the center of Vedic rituals in ''Shatapatha Brahmana'' and the teachings of the ''Bhagavad Gita'' revolve around this absolute Person, the primordial genderless absolute, which is same as the goal of Pancaratra Agama and Tantra.{{sfn|Hudson|2002|pp=162\u2013163}}\n\n== Translations ==\n{{multiple image\n| align = right\n| image1 = 1785 Bhagavad Gita translation English.jpg\n| width1 = 150\n| alt1 = \n| caption1 = \n| image2 = 1787 Bhagavad Gita re-translation French.jpg\n\n| width2 = 143\n| alt2 = \n| caption2 = \n| image3 = Bhagvat - Geeta, Wesleyan Mission Press, Bangalore, 1849.jpg\n| width3 = 200\n| alt3 = \n| caption3 = \n| footer = Cover pages of early ''Gita'' translations.

He is advised by Krishna to do his ''sva-dharma'', a term that has been variously interpreted. According to the Indologist Paul Hacker, the contextual meaning in the ''Gita'' is the \"dharma of a particular varna\".{{sfn|Hacker|Halbfass|1995|p=264}} Neo-Hindus such as Bankim Chandra Chatterjee, states Hacker, have preferred to not translate it in those terms, or \"dharma\" as religion, but leave ''Gita's'' message as \"everyone must follow his ''sva-dharma''\".{{sfn|Hacker|Halbfass|1995|pp=261\u2013262}} According to Chatterjee, the Hindus already understand the meaning of that term. To render it in English for non-Hindus for its better understanding, one must ask ''what is the sva-dharma for the non-Hindus''? The Lord, states Chatterjee, created millions and millions of people, and he did not ordain ''dharma'' only for Indians [Hindus] and \"make all the others dharma-less\", for \"are not the non-Hindus also his children\"? According to Chatterjee, the Krishna's religion of ''Gita'' is \"not so narrow-minded\".{{sfn|Hacker|Halbfass|1995|pp=261\u2013262}} This argument, states Hacker, is an attempt to \"universalize Hinduism\".{{sfn|Hacker|Halbfass|1995|pp=261\u2013262}}\n\nThe ''Gita'' has been cited and criticized as a Hindu text that supports ''varna-dharma'' and the caste system.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Olcott |first=Mason |title=The Caste System of India |journal=American Sociological Review | publisher=Sage Publications | volume=9 |issue=6 |year=1944 |doi=10.2307/2085128 |pages=648\u2013657|jstor=2085128 }}</ref><ref>{{cite book|author=Susan Bayly|title=Caste, Society and Politics in India from the Eighteenth Century to the Modern Age| url=https://books.google.com/books?id=HbAjKR_iHogC | year=2001| publisher=Cambridge University Press| isbn=978-0-521-79842-6| pages=13\u201314}}</ref>{{sfn|Maitra|2018|p=22}} [[B.

According to the Indologist Ananya Vajpeyi, the ''Gita'' does not elaborate on the means or stages of war, nor on ''ahimsa'', except for stating that \"''ahimsa'' is virtuous and characterizes an awakened, steadfast, ethical man\" in verses such as 13.7\u201310 and 16.1\u20135.<ref name=\"Vajpeyi2012p66\">{{cite book|author=Ananya Vajpeyi|title=Righteous Republic: The Political Foundations of Modern India |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=knCDsvJYy1EC&pg=PA66 |year=2012|publisher=Harvard University Press |isbn=978-0-674-06728-8|pages=66\u201367}}</ref> For Gandhi, states Vajpeyi, ''ahimsa'' is the \"relationship between self and other\" while he and his fellow Indians battled against the colonial rule. Gandhian ahimsa is in fact \"the essence of the entire ''Gita''\", according to Vajpeyi.<ref name=\"Vajpeyi2012p66\"/> The teachings of the ''Gita'' on ''ahimsa'' are ambiguous, states Arvind Sharma, and this is best exemplified by the fact that Nathuram Godse stated the ''Gita'' as his inspiration to do his ''dharma'' after he [[Assassination of Mahatma Gandhi|assassinated Mahatma Gandhi]].{{sfn|Sharma|1986|pp=xiv\u2013xv}} [[Thomas Merton]], the Trappist monk and author of books on Zen Buddhism, concurs with Gandhi and states that the ''Gita'' is not teaching violence nor propounding a \"make war\" ideology. Instead, it is teaching peace and discussing one's duty to examine what is right and then act with pure intentions, when one's faces difficult and repugnant choices.{{sfn|Miller|1986|pp=149\u2013150}}\n\n=== Largest copy ===\nThe world's largest Bhagavad Gita is in the [[ISKCON Temple Delhi]], which claims to be the world's largest sacred book of any religion.

The ''Ramayana'' describes Mandodari as beautiful, pious, and righteous. She is extolled as one of the ''[[Panchakanya]]'' (\"Five Girls\"), the recital of whose names is believed to dispel sin.\n\nMandodari was the daughter of [[Mayasura]], the King of the [[Asura]]s (demons), and the ''[[apsara]]'' (celestial nymphs) Hema. Mandodari bears two sons: Meghanada ([[Indrajit]]) and [[Akshayakumara]]. According to some Ramayana adaptations, Mandodari is also the mother of [[Rama]]'s wife [[Sita]],  who is infamously kidnapped by Ravana. Despite her husband's faults, Mandodari loves him and advises him to follow the path of righteousness. Mandodari repeatedly advises Ravana to return Sita to Rama, but her advice falls on deaf ears. Her love and loyalty to Ravana are praised in the ''Ramayana''.\n\nDifferent versions of the ''Ramayana'' record her ill-treatment at the hands of Rama's monkey generals. Some versions say they disturb a sacrifice by Ravana, and some that they destroy her chastity, which was the last protection for Ravana's life. [[Hanuman]] tricks her into disclosing the location of a magical arrow which Rama uses to kill Ravana. After Ravana's death, [[Vibhishana]]\u2014Ravana's younger brother who joins forces with Rama and is responsible for Ravana's death\u2014marries Mandodari on the advice of Rama.\n\n==Marriage and later life==\n[[File:Mandodaree Repressing the Wrath Of Ravana.jpg|thumb|Mandodari stops Ravana from slaying Sita.]]\nRavana comes to the house of Mayasura and falls in love with Mandodari. Mandodari and Ravana are soon married with [[Vedic]] rites. Mandodari bears Ravana three sons: [[Meghanada]] (Indrajit), [[Atikaya]] and [[Akshayakumara]].<ref name = \"Mani476\"/> [[Mandore]], a town located 9 km north of [[Jodhpur]], is believed to be the native place of Mandodari.

She is aware of Ravana's weakness towards women.{{sfn|Mukherjee|1999|p=39}}{{sfn|Ayyer|2006|pp=50-51}} A righteous woman, Mandodari tries to lead Ravana to righteousness, but Ravana always ignores her advice. She advises him to not to subdue the ''[[Navagraha]]'', the nine celestial beings that govern one's destiny, and not to seduce [[Vedavati]], who would be reborn as Sita and cause the destruction of Ravana.{{sfn|Ayyer|2006|pp=50-51}}\n\nRavana kidnaps [[Sita]], the wife of [[Rama]], the exiled prince of [[Ayodhya]], who is an incarnation of the god [[Vishnu]]. Mandodari advises Ravana to return Sita to Rama, but to no avail. Mandodari knows this lust will bring the downfall of Ravana.{{sfn|Mukherjee|1999|p=39}}{{sfn|Ayyer|2006|pp=50-51}}\nMandodari is described as a beautiful woman in Valmiki's Ramayana. When [[Hanuman]], the monkey messenger of Rama, comes to Lanka in search of Sita, he is stupefied by Mandodari's beauty when he enters Ravana's bed chambers and mistakes Mandodari for Sita.<ref name = \"Mani476\">Mani p. 476</ref> When Hanuman finally finds Sita, he finds Ravana threatening to kill Sita unless she marries him. Ravana raises his sword to behead Sita when she refuses. Mandodari saves Sita by holding Ravana's hand. Mandodari says that the murder of a woman is a heinous sin and thus Ravana should not kill Sita. She asks Ravana to entertain himself with his other wives and give up the idea of having Sita as his wife. Ravana spares Sita's life, but does not give up his wish to marry Sita.{{sfn|Wheeler|1869|p=338}} Though Mandodari considers Sita inferior to her in beauty and ancestry, Mandodari acknowledges Sita's devotion to Rama and compares her to goddesses like [[Sachi]] and [[Rohini (nakshatra)|Rohini]].{{sfn|Mukherjee|1999|p=39}}\n\nWhen all attempts for a peaceful return of Sita fail, Rama declares war on Ravana's Lanka. Before the final battle against Rama, Mandodari makes a last attempt to dissuade Ravana, but to no avail.{{sfn|Wheeler|1869|p=365}} Finally, Mandodari stands by her husband in the final battle like an obedient and faithful wife,{{sfn|Mukherjee|1999|p=39}} though she advises her son Meghanada, alias Indrajit (\"One who had conquered [[Indra]]; the god-king of heaven\"), not to fight Rama.{{sfn|Wheeler|1869|p=370}}\n\nSeveral manuscripts of the ''Ramayana'' mention a story in which Angada drags Mandodari by her hair in presence of Ravana as a punishment for Ravana's treatment of Sita. Satyatirtha, a commentator on ''Ramayana'', dismisses this story as spurious.{{sfn|Goldman et al.|2009|p=1320}} According to this story: When all of Ravana's sons and warriors die, Ravana organizes a ''[[yajna]]'' (\"fire sacrifice\") to assure his victory. Rama sends a troop of monkeys headed by Hanuman and the monkey prince [[Angada]] to destroy this ''yajna''. The monkeys create havoc in Ravana's palace, but Ravana continues the ''yajna''. Angada drags Mandodari by her hair in front of Ravana. Mandodari pleads to her husband to save her and reminds him what Rama is doing for his wife. The enraged Ravana abandons the ''yajna'' and strikes Angada with his sword. With the ''yajna'' disturbed, Angada's purpose is served and he leaves Mandodari and escapes. Mandodari again implores Ravana to surrender Sita to Rama, but he refuses.{{sfn|Wheeler|1869|pp=373-4}} Other Ramayana adaptations present more gruesome descriptions of the incident. The ''[[Krittivasi Ramayan]]'' narrates that the monkeys dragged Mandodari and tore off her clothes. In ''Bicitra Ramayana'', it is Hanuman who humiliates Mandodari. The Thai adaptation ''[[Ramakien]]'' narrates  a symbolic rape of Mandodari. Hanuman sleeps with her in the form of Ravana and destroys her chastity, which protects Ravana's life.{{sfn|Lutgendorf|2007|p=211}}\n\n[[File:Ravana is grieved.jpg|thumb|350px|While preparations for Ravana's funeral are underway, Ravana's wives headed by Mandodari (with her back to the viewer, upbraiding her hair) lament his death.]]\n\nRavana fights the final duel with Rama. Rama fails to kill Ravana with his ordinary arrows, but finally kills with a magical arrow. While Valmiki's Ramayana narrates that the magical arrow was given to Rama by Indra, in other versions the magical arrow is hidden in Mandodari's bed chambers or under her bed. While Mandodari is engrossed in worshipping the goddess [[Parvati]] for Ravana's wellbeing, Hanuman comes to her disguised as a [[Brahmin]]. After winning her confidence, he tricks her into revealing the secret location of the arrow. Hanuman seizes the arrow and gives it to Rama, leading to Ravana's end.{{sfn|Lutgendorf|2007|pp=154, 217}} Mandodari appears at the death scene of Ravana in a disarrayed state and laments his death.{{sfn|Mukherjee|1999|p=39}}{{sfn|Wheeler|1869|p=382}} In this battle, Mandodari loses her husband, her sons and her kinsmen.<ref name=\"Bhattacharya\"/>\n\nAfter the death of Ravana, Rama advises Vibhishana to take Mandodari as his wife, even though he already has a wife. A theory suggests that Ravana's race may have had [[Matrilineality|matrilineal]] families and thus, to restore order in the kingdom after Ravana's death, it was necessary for Vibhishana to marry the reigning queen to get the right to rule.{{sfn|Shashi|1998|p=222}} Another theory suggests it may be a non-[[Aryan]] custom to marry the reigning queen.<ref name=\"Bhattacharya\"/> The marriage between Mandodari and Vibhishana is purely an \"act of statesmanship\", rather than a marriage based on their \"mutual sexual interference\".{{sfn|Shashi|1998|p=222}} Mandodari may have agreed to marry Vibhishana, her younger brother-in-law, as this would lead the kingdom to prosperity and stability as allies of Rama's Ayodhya, and she would continue to have a say in governance.<ref name=\"Bhattacharya\"/> Another reason for the marriage is as an alternative to suicide for the widowed Mandodari, which is averted by Rama.{{sfn|Shashi|1998|p=222}}\n\n==Mother of Sita?==\n[[File:Ravi Varma-Ravana Sita Jathayu.jpg|thumb|right|Ravana abducts Rama's wife, Sita. According to some ''Ramayana'' adaptations, Ravana was abducting his own daughter from a union with Mandodari.]]\nThough Valmiki's Ramayana does not record Mandodari as being the mother of Sita, some later adaptations of the Ramayana depict Mandodari as the mother of Sita or at least the cause of the latter's birth.\n\nThe ''[[Adbhuta Ramayana]]'' narrates: Ravana used to store the blood of sages he killed in a large pot. The sage Gritsamada was practicing penance to acquire the goddess Lakshmi as his daughter. He stored milk from Darbha grass and purified it with [[mantra]]s in a pot so that Lakshmi would inhabit it. Ravana poured the milk from this pot into his blood pot. Mandodari is frustrated seeing the evil deeds of Ravana, so she decides to commit suicide by drinking the contents of the blood-pot, which is described to be more poisonous than poison. Instead of dying, Mandodari gets pregnant with the incarnation of Lakshmi due to the power of Gritsamada's milk. Mandodari buries the foetus in [[Kurukshetra]], where it is discovered by Janaka, who named her Sita.<ref name = \"Mani721\"/>{{sfn|Shashi|1998|pp=14-15, Sarga VIII of Adbhuta Ramayana}}\n\nThe ''[[Devi Bhagavata Purana]]'' says: When Ravana wants to marry Mandodari, Maya warns him that her horoscope indicated her first-born would destroy her clan and should be killed. Ignoring Maya's advice, Ravana buries his first child by Mandodari in a casket in Janaka\u2019s city, where it is discovered and grew up as Sita.<ref name = \"Mani721\"/> [[Jain]] adaptations of the Ramayana like ''Vasudevahindi'', ''Uttara-purana'', and others also state that Sita is the daughter of Ravana and Mandodari, and is abandoned when she is prophesied to be the cause of the end of Ravana and his family.{{sfn|Shashi|1998|p=237}}\n\nIn the [[Malay language|Malay]] ''Seri Rama'' and the [[Indonesian language|Indonesian]]-[[Java]]nese ''Rama Keling'', Ravana wants to possess Mandodari, the mother of Rama, but instead marries a pseudo-Mandodari, who looks like the real one. Rama's father has a union with this pseudo-Mandodari, resulting in the birth of Sita, who is nominally Ravana's daughter.{{sfn|Shashi|1998|p=243}}\n\nAccording to the ''Ananda Ramayana'', king Padmaksha had a daughter named Padma - an incarnate of the goddess Lakshmi. When her marriage is organized, Rakshasas (demons) kill the king. The grief-stricken Padma jumps into fire. Ravana discovers her body, which had turned into five jewels, in the fire and takes it to Lanka sealed in a box. Mandodari opens the box and finds Padma inside it. She advises Ravana to cast off the box containing the ill-fated Padma, who led to the doom of her father. When the lid of the box is closed, Padma curses Ravana that she will return to Lanka and cause his doom. Ravana buries the box in the city of Janaka, who discovers Padma and brings her up as Sita.<ref name = \"Mani721\">Mani p. 721</ref>\n\n==Assessment==\n[[File:COLLECTIE TROPENMUSEUM Reli\u00ebf op de aan Brahma gewijde tempel op de Candi Lara Jonggrang oftewel het Prambanan tempelcomplex TMnr 10016175.jpg|thumb|right|Queen Mandodari and the women of Lanka mourning the death of [[Ravana]].

Mandodari defies the stereotype of this racism. She is simple, unswerving, and self-effacing, driven by the light of knowledge which gives meaning to solid materialism in an age that is shrouded by impulse, passion, and desire. She is the instrument that awakens the mind and counsels reason when irrationality becomes the core being. That she goes unheard and unheeded does not change her path. To her, the [[dharmic]] part is inward-looking, while the role of the dutiful wife is the external self. Mandodari thought that her duty to her husband on issues of morals and values ended with her telling him what she thought of his actions. She neither put up any brave fight to stop him nor considered it her duty to do so.\n</blockquote>\n\nMandodari's role is short in the Ramayana but very important.

The ''Ramayana'' describes Mandodari as beautiful, pious, and righteous. She is extolled as one of the ''[[Panchakanya]]'' (\"Five Girls\"), the recital of whose names is believed to dispel sin.\n\nMandodari was the daughter of [[Mayasura]], the King of the [[Asura]]s (demons), and the ''[[apsara]]'' (celestial nymphs) Hema. Mandodari bears two sons: Meghanada ([[Indrajit]]) and [[Akshayakumara]]. According to some Ramayana adaptations, Mandodari is also the mother of [[Rama]]'s wife [[Sita]],  who is infamously kidnapped by Ravana. Despite her husband's faults, Mandodari loves him and advises him to follow the path of righteousness. Mandodari repeatedly advises Ravana to return Sita to Rama, but her advice falls on deaf ears. Her love and loyalty to Ravana are praised in the ''Ramayana''.\n\nDifferent versions of the ''Ramayana'' record her ill-treatment at the hands of Rama's monkey generals. Some versions say they disturb a sacrifice by Ravana, and some that they destroy her chastity, which was the last protection for Ravana's life. [[Hanuman]] tricks her into disclosing the location of a magical arrow which Rama uses to kill Ravana. After Ravana's death, [[Vibhishana]]\u2014Ravana's younger brother who joins forces with Rama and is responsible for Ravana's death\u2014marries Mandodari on the advice of Rama.\n\n==Birth==\nThe ''Uttara Ramayana'' narrates a story about the birth of Mandodari. [[Mayasura]] (Maya), the son of sage [[Kashyapa]] is married to the ''[[apsara]]'' (heavenly nymph) Hema. They have two sons, Mayavi and Dundubhi, but long for a daughter, so they start performing penances to seek the favour of the god [[Shiva]].<ref name = \"Mani476\"/>\n\nMeanwhile, an apsara named Madhura arrives at [[Mount Kailash]], the abode of Shiva, to pay her respects. In absence of his wife [[Parvati]], Madhura has clandestine coitus with Shiva. When Parvati returns, she finds traces of ashes from Shiva\u2019s body on the breasts of Madhura. Agitated, Parvati curses Madhura and sends her to live in a well as a frog for twelve years. Shiva consoles Madhura and says she will become a beautiful woman and be married to a great valorous man. After twelve years, Madhura becomes a beautiful maiden again and cries out loudly from the well. Mayasura and Hema, who are performing penance nearby, answer her call and adopt her as their daughter. They bring her up as Mandodari.<ref name = \"Mani476\"/>\n\n==Marriage and later life==\n[[File:Mandodaree Repressing the Wrath Of Ravana.jpg|thumb|Mandodari stops Ravana from slaying Sita.]]\nRavana comes to the house of Mayasura and falls in love with Mandodari. Mandodari and Ravana are soon married with [[Vedic]] rites. Mandodari bears Ravana three sons: [[Meghanada]] (Indrajit), [[Atikaya]] and [[Akshayakumara]].<ref name = \"Mani476\"/> [[Mandore]], a town located 9 km north of [[Jodhpur]], is believed to be the native place of Mandodari. Ravana is treated as a son-in-law among some local [[Brahmin]]s and has a temple dedicated to him here.<ref name=\"Times Of India#\">{{cite news | url=http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/lucknow/Saluting-the-virtues-of-Ravan/articleshow/49344194.cms | title=Saluting the virtues of Ravan | work=Shailvee Sharda | date=14 October 2015 | agency=Times Of India | accessdate=14 October 2015 | author=Times Of India | location=Lucknow}}</ref>\n\nDespite Ravana's faults, Mandodari loves him and is proud of his strength. She is aware of Ravana's weakness towards women.{{sfn|Mukherjee|1999|p=39}}{{sfn|Ayyer|2006|pp=50-51}} A righteous woman, Mandodari tries to lead Ravana to righteousness, but Ravana always ignores her advice. She advises him to not to subdue the ''[[Navagraha]]'', the nine celestial beings that govern one's destiny, and not to seduce [[Vedavati]], who would be reborn as Sita and cause the destruction of Ravana.{{sfn|Ayyer|2006|pp=50-51}}\n\nRavana kidnaps [[Sita]], the wife of [[Rama]], the exiled prince of [[Ayodhya]], who is an incarnation of the god [[Vishnu]]. Mandodari advises Ravana to return Sita to Rama, but to no avail. Mandodari knows this lust will bring the downfall of Ravana.{{sfn|Mukherjee|1999|p=39}}{{sfn|Ayyer|2006|pp=50-51}}\nMandodari is described as a beautiful woman in Valmiki's Ramayana. When [[Hanuman]], the monkey messenger of Rama, comes to Lanka in search of Sita, he is stupefied by Mandodari's beauty when he enters Ravana's bed chambers and mistakes Mandodari for Sita.<ref name = \"Mani476\">Mani p. 476</ref> When Hanuman finally finds Sita, he finds Ravana threatening to kill Sita unless she marries him. Ravana raises his sword to behead Sita when she refuses. Mandodari saves Sita by holding Ravana's hand. Mandodari says that the murder of a woman is a heinous sin and thus Ravana should not kill Sita. She asks Ravana to entertain himself with his other wives and give up the idea of having Sita as his wife. Ravana spares Sita's life, but does not give up his wish to marry Sita.{{sfn|Wheeler|1869|p=338}} Though Mandodari considers Sita inferior to her in beauty and ancestry, Mandodari acknowledges Sita's devotion to Rama and compares her to goddesses like [[Sachi]] and [[Rohini (nakshatra)|Rohini]].{{sfn|Mukherjee|1999|p=39}}\n\nWhen all attempts for a peaceful return of Sita fail, Rama declares war on Ravana's Lanka. Before the final battle against Rama, Mandodari makes a last attempt to dissuade Ravana, but to no avail.{{sfn|Wheeler|1869|p=365}} Finally, Mandodari stands by her husband in the final battle like an obedient and faithful wife,{{sfn|Mukherjee|1999|p=39}} though she advises her son Meghanada, alias Indrajit (\"One who had conquered [[Indra]]; the god-king of heaven\"), not to fight Rama.{{sfn|Wheeler|1869|p=370}}\n\nSeveral manuscripts of the ''Ramayana'' mention a story in which Angada drags Mandodari by her hair in presence of Ravana as a punishment for Ravana's treatment of Sita. Satyatirtha, a commentator on ''Ramayana'', dismisses this story as spurious.{{sfn|Goldman et al.|2009|p=1320}} According to this story: When all of Ravana's sons and warriors die, Ravana organizes a ''[[yajna]]'' (\"fire sacrifice\") to assure his victory. Rama sends a troop of monkeys headed by Hanuman and the monkey prince [[Angada]] to destroy this ''yajna''. The monkeys create havoc in Ravana's palace, but Ravana continues the ''yajna''. Angada drags Mandodari by her hair in front of Ravana. Mandodari pleads to her husband to save her and reminds him what Rama is doing for his wife. The enraged Ravana abandons the ''yajna'' and strikes Angada with his sword. With the ''yajna'' disturbed, Angada's purpose is served and he leaves Mandodari and escapes. Mandodari again implores Ravana to surrender Sita to Rama, but he refuses.{{sfn|Wheeler|1869|pp=373-4}} Other Ramayana adaptations present more gruesome descriptions of the incident. The ''[[Krittivasi Ramayan]]'' narrates that the monkeys dragged Mandodari and tore off her clothes. In ''Bicitra Ramayana'', it is Hanuman who humiliates Mandodari. The Thai adaptation ''[[Ramakien]]'' narrates  a symbolic rape of Mandodari. Hanuman sleeps with her in the form of Ravana and destroys her chastity, which protects Ravana's life.{{sfn|Lutgendorf|2007|p=211}}\n\n[[File:Ravana is grieved.jpg|thumb|350px|While preparations for Ravana's funeral are underway, Ravana's wives headed by Mandodari (with her back to the viewer, upbraiding her hair) lament his death.]]\n\nRavana fights the final duel with Rama. Rama fails to kill Ravana with his ordinary arrows, but finally kills with a magical arrow. While Valmiki's Ramayana narrates that the magical arrow was given to Rama by Indra, in other versions the magical arrow is hidden in Mandodari's bed chambers or under her bed. While Mandodari is engrossed in worshipping the goddess [[Parvati]] for Ravana's wellbeing, Hanuman comes to her disguised as a [[Brahmin]]. After winning her confidence, he tricks her into revealing the secret location of the arrow. Hanuman seizes the arrow and gives it to Rama, leading to Ravana's end.{{sfn|Lutgendorf|2007|pp=154, 217}} Mandodari appears at the death scene of Ravana in a disarrayed state and laments his death.{{sfn|Mukherjee|1999|p=39}}{{sfn|Wheeler|1869|p=382}} In this battle, Mandodari loses her husband, her sons and her kinsmen.<ref name=\"Bhattacharya\"/>\n\nAfter the death of Ravana, Rama advises Vibhishana to take Mandodari as his wife, even though he already has a wife. A theory suggests that Ravana's race may have had [[Matrilineality|matrilineal]] families and thus, to restore order in the kingdom after Ravana's death, it was necessary for Vibhishana to marry the reigning queen to get the right to rule.{{sfn|Shashi|1998|p=222}} Another theory suggests it may be a non-[[Aryan]] custom to marry the reigning queen.<ref name=\"Bhattacharya\"/> The marriage between Mandodari and Vibhishana is purely an \"act of statesmanship\", rather than a marriage based on their \"mutual sexual interference\".{{sfn|Shashi|1998|p=222}} Mandodari may have agreed to marry Vibhishana, her younger brother-in-law, as this would lead the kingdom to prosperity and stability as allies of Rama's Ayodhya, and she would continue to have a say in governance.<ref name=\"Bhattacharya\"/> Another reason for the marriage is as an alternative to suicide for the widowed Mandodari, which is averted by Rama.{{sfn|Shashi|1998|p=222}}\n\n==Mother of Sita?==\n[[File:Ravi Varma-Ravana Sita Jathayu.jpg|thumb|right|Ravana abducts Rama's wife, Sita. According to some ''Ramayana'' adaptations, Ravana was abducting his own daughter from a union with Mandodari.]]\nThough Valmiki's Ramayana does not record Mandodari as being the mother of Sita, some later adaptations of the Ramayana depict Mandodari as the mother of Sita or at least the cause of the latter's birth.\n\nThe ''[[Adbhuta Ramayana]]'' narrates: Ravana used to store the blood of sages he killed in a large pot. The sage Gritsamada was practicing penance to acquire the goddess Lakshmi as his daughter. He stored milk from Darbha grass and purified it with [[mantra]]s in a pot so that Lakshmi would inhabit it. Ravana poured the milk from this pot into his blood pot. Mandodari is frustrated seeing the evil deeds of Ravana, so she decides to commit suicide by drinking the contents of the blood-pot, which is described to be more poisonous than poison. Instead of dying, Mandodari gets pregnant with the incarnation of Lakshmi due to the power of Gritsamada's milk. Mandodari buries the foetus in [[Kurukshetra]], where it is discovered by Janaka, who named her Sita.<ref name = \"Mani721\"/>{{sfn|Shashi|1998|pp=14-15, Sarga VIII of Adbhuta Ramayana}}\n\nThe ''[[Devi Bhagavata Purana]]'' says: When Ravana wants to marry Mandodari, Maya warns him that her horoscope indicated her first-born would destroy her clan and should be killed. Ignoring Maya's advice, Ravana buries his first child by Mandodari in a casket in Janaka\u2019s city, where it is discovered and grew up as Sita.<ref name = \"Mani721\"/> [[Jain]] adaptations of the Ramayana like ''Vasudevahindi'', ''Uttara-purana'', and others also state that Sita is the daughter of Ravana and Mandodari, and is abandoned when she is prophesied to be the cause of the end of Ravana and his family.{{sfn|Shashi|1998|p=237}}\n\nIn the [[Malay language|Malay]] ''Seri Rama'' and the [[Indonesian language|Indonesian]]-[[Java]]nese ''Rama Keling'', Ravana wants to possess Mandodari, the mother of Rama, but instead marries a pseudo-Mandodari, who looks like the real one. Rama's father has a union with this pseudo-Mandodari, resulting in the birth of Sita, who is nominally Ravana's daughter.{{sfn|Shashi|1998|p=243}}\n\nAccording to the ''Ananda Ramayana'', king Padmaksha had a daughter named Padma - an incarnate of the goddess Lakshmi. When her marriage is organized, Rakshasas (demons) kill the king. The grief-stricken Padma jumps into fire. Ravana discovers her body, which had turned into five jewels, in the fire and takes it to Lanka sealed in a box. Mandodari opens the box and finds Padma inside it. She advises Ravana to cast off the box containing the ill-fated Padma, who led to the doom of her father. When the lid of the box is closed, Padma curses Ravana that she will return to Lanka and cause his doom. Ravana buries the box in the city of Janaka, who discovers Padma and brings her up as Sita.<ref name = \"Mani721\">Mani p. 721</ref>\n\n==Assessment==\n[[File:COLLECTIE TROPENMUSEUM Reli\u00ebf op de aan Brahma gewijde tempel op de Candi Lara Jonggrang oftewel het Prambanan tempelcomplex TMnr 10016175.jpg|thumb|right|Queen Mandodari and the women of Lanka mourning the death of [[Ravana]].

She is the instrument that awakens the mind and counsels reason when irrationality becomes the core being. That she goes unheard and unheeded does not change her path. To her, the [[dharmic]] part is inward-looking, while the role of the dutiful wife is the external self. Mandodari thought that her duty to her husband on issues of morals and values ended with her telling him what she thought of his actions.

It is one of three ''Peanuts'' projects to date (the others being ''[[Snoopy, Come Home]]'' and ''[[The Peanuts Movie]]'') not to have \"Charlie Brown\" in the title (though the working title was ''Those Were the Days, Charlie Brown'') and one of the few ''Peanuts'' specials to feature adults on-screen.\n\n==Summary==\nThe story begins with a [[cold open]]ing at the Daisy Hill Puppy Farm, set at the time of [[Snoopy|Snoopy's]] puppyhood.  While still puppies, he and his [[Snoopy's siblings|siblings]] quickly become adults and adept musicians. Each one learns to play an instrument. Snoopy plays the guitar, Spike plays the first fiddle, Belle on the second fiddle, Marbles on banjo, Olaf on jug, Molly on mandolin, Rover on steel guitar, and finally Andy on drum set. As the years go by, the owner creates a sign (which reads \"PUPPIES FOR SALE\"). By that, the puppies are going to be leaving their mother some years later. As the years go by, the puppies quickly mature as they are all put up for sale. Missy (Snoopy and his siblings's mother) and the puppies cry as when they see the sign (and read it), which says \"PUPPIES FOR SALE\". After Missy and the puppies read the sign, the puppies know they are going to be parting ways forever when they are sold from the puppy farm. When they are sold, the puppies are going to not only leave their mother but also each other (in other words: \"their whole family\"). However, they do know that they can visit each other every once in a while and can sometimes have reunions with each other (and even the potential for their mother). \n\nMeanwhile, [[Charlie Brown]], apparently depressed from a recent defeat, arrives home to an empty, unwelcoming house.  He tells his sister [[Sally Brown|Sally]] he needs to have someone to welcome him home after a defeat, like a dog.\n\nBack at the Daisy Hill Puppy Farm, Snoopy and his siblings are all playing music together.  Snoopy is sold to [[List of minor characters in Peanuts#Lila|Lila]], his first owner.  As he is removed from his family, his guitar is removed from the music.  His siblings are then sold, one by one. Each time a puppy is sold, their name on the list of names (on the chalkboard) gets crossed out (Snoopy is the first puppy on the list). As they are removed, the music continues to decompose until the last one, Olaf, is sold (Olaf is marked as the third puppy on the list). Lila and Snoopy have fun together for a brief time in Lila's house (which is at first shown with her family living in a neighborhood).  However, when Lila and her family have moved from their old neighborhood to an apartment building, they are told by the landlord and they say that no pets are allowed in the building. Because pets are not allowed, her family tells her they can no longer keep Snoopy. At this point, her mother tells Lila that Snoopy has to go back to the Daisy Hill Puppy Farm. Lila responds by crying out loud (she says, \"But Mom...! They can't do that! It's too unfair! It's heartful break! How can I ever tell him?\"). \n\nLila goes over to Snoopy (who is still sleeping in his dog bed), and then has a word with Snoopy (starting off with the first line, \"Snoopy? I have to talk to you. You are a good puppy. And I love you very much\".). Snoopy (not in trouble), Lila tells him about the sad news. She says that she and her family can no longer keep him because the building has a new law. According to the law, pets are not allowed in the building. After she tells him that, she is very sorry and he has to go back to the puppy farm. But she promises to him that she can always visit him anytime. Lila sadly (but eventually obedient), is aware about the \"NO PETS ALLOWED\" policy from her building's landlord. So with her mother, she returns him back. She returns Snoopy to the Daisy Hill Puppy Farm and tearfully says goodbye (and says she is going to miss him). \n\nThe owner of the puppy farm tells Snoopy (back at the puppy farm) that he promises to find him a new home and owner. He has not failed yet. The original owner (the one of the puppy farm) goes back to the chalkboard (which previously has all the puppy names crossed off). But since Snoopy has returned back, he reinstates Snoopy's name on the list. The used puppy Snoopy is back at the puppy farm. In the film, Snoopy is the only puppy who becomes purchased by an owner, only to be returned back, and (temporarily) still living at the puppy farm. This reverts to the fact that he's back to living with his mother (Missy) at the puppy farm until someone buys him again. Later in the film, it turns out to be Charlie Brown. \n\nNot very long after that, next customer turns out that it is going to be Charlie Brown. Charlie Brown firmly decides it's time for him to get a dog.  He and [[Linus van Pelt|Linus]] head to the Daisy Hill Puppy Farm.  He negotiates with the owner and is able to purchase Snoopy for $5, as that is all he has.  While talking to the owner, Linus oversees some paperwork and is concerned with knowing that Snoopy has a previous owner and is a \"used dog\".  Charlie Brown happily takes him home, tries to train him, and soon realizes that he is an unusual dog.  A [[Montage (filmmaking)|montage]] showcases some of his abilities, such as playing baseball, sledding, surfing, and tennis. Snoopy been with Charlie Brown and the gang for four years.\n\nAfter about a [[lustrum]], Charlie Brown realizes that Snoopy misses his family and invites him and his siblings to a reunion at the Daisy Hill Puppy Farm, to which he eagerly agrees.  Before that, on the night before, Charlie Brown explains that Snoopy has been with him and Sally for four or five years. Invitations are sent to Belle, Spike, Olaf, Marbles, Molly, Rover, and Andy, who unanimously agree to it.  Each one excitedly heads to the reunion, carrying their respective instruments.\n\nThey all arrive at Charlie Brown's house.  He, Sally, Snoopy, and Snoopy's siblings get on a bus to visit the Daisy Hill Puppy Farm for their reunion.  Eventually, they arrive at the Daisy Hill bus stop. But instead of the puppy farm, all they see is a parking garage (a parking garage, a small pile of dirt, and no puppy farm). Charlie Brown is confused. But when he asks the bus driver if it's the Daisy Hill Puppy Farm, however the bus driver (though he does not know that the puppy farm was demolished for a parking garage) insists that it is. Undaunted, Snoopy and his siblings exit the bus and play music on the sidewalk in front of the parking garage (forgetting at first that the puppy farm which was their old home is now a parking lot). Really (before the notice), the Daisy Hill Puppy Farm during this time had been demolished and replaced with a parking garage (after it had been in operation for a lustrum). \n\nMeanwhile, Charlie Brown explores the area and discovers an old \"Puppy For Sale\" sign half buried in the dirt pile. He says out loud that (now after he finds the old sign) it is it (the puppy farm). Continuing his talk, he shows Snoopy and his siblings their old home (which had been replaced with a parking garage) and tells them that the said location (where is the puppy farm used to be) is the place where their old home was. Lastly, he realizes the farm is now sold, excavated, and discontinued (no longer existing) in favor of the urban parking garage development. In fact, now the puppy farm has ceased operations and is now a parking garage, it is no longer even possible to go to the puppy farm either. The \"puppy farm\" is no longer a puppy farm but a five story parking garage. However, despite the permanent loss of the puppy farm, Snoopy and his siblings (even though that they now know it's not there anymore) seem happy to be together again, and without sadness, they continue to play more music.\n\nCharlie Brown later (as now he's shown with Linus) comes to acceptance. He realizes that it made Snoopy and his brothers and sisters happy, and declares it was a reunion even if it was not the best.  He then wonders how Snoopy's siblings are going to get home. Snoopy responds by getting into his [[World War I]] [[flying ace]] costume, and ushers them up on top of his [[Snoopy#Doghouse|doghouse]] (i.e. [[Sopwith Camel]]).  The camera cuts back to Charlie Brown and Linus, with several off-screen sound effects insinuating that Snoopy is flying his 'plane'.  When the camera cuts back to it, all his siblings have gone back home (and back to their real sold owners who previously purchased them from the puppy farm four years ago), and Snoopy is standing on the ground next to it, picking his teeth.  Charlie Brown is shocked and wonders aloud how he could do that, to which Linus replies, \"Well, he's your dog, Charlie Brown\".\n\n==Contradictions with the Peanuts comic strip and Snoopy Come Home==\nCharles Schulz did not consider material from the television specials and films to be [[Canon (fiction)|canonical]] with the Peanuts comic strip.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.peanutscollectorclub.com/peantfaq.txt |title=Peanuts FAQ }}</ref>  This results in the following continuity errors:\n*In the comic strip, Snoopy existed as Charlie Brown's dog long before Sally and Linus were born.

In this special, they both go to get him.\n*In the strip and ''Snoopy, Come Home'', Linus calls the Daisy Hill Puppy Farm to find out about Snoopy's history when he goes to see Lila in the hospital, and finds out that he was a \"used dog\".  In this special, when Charlie Brown and Linus go to pick him up, Linus finds out about his history in a ledger sitting on a desk.\n*In the strip, Snoopy (and Woodstock) find out on their own that the Daisy Hill Puppy Farm (Snoopy's old home) was closed and demolished and turned into a parking garage. In the special Charlie Brown discovers this and shows this to Snoopy and his siblings. Charlie Brown even says a line similar to what Snoopy says in the strip: \"Do you realize what happened? They're parking on your memories!\". In the strip, however, Snoopy is shown with Woodstock at this. Snoopy (as Woodstock looks on) says about the parking garage (which is what the puppy farm was turned into after it was demolished), \"YOU STUPID PEOPLE!

Relatively little-known for a half-century after its introduction, it achieved iconic status in the [[post-war period]] as the preferred typeface of many [[Switzerland|Swiss]] graphic designers in what became called the [[International Typographic Style|'International' or 'Swiss' design style]] which became popular across the [[Western world]] in the 1950s and 1960s.

Relatively little-known for a half-century after its introduction, it achieved iconic status in the [[post-war period]] as the preferred typeface of many [[Switzerland|Swiss]] graphic designers in what became called the [[International Typographic Style|'International' or 'Swiss' design style]] which became popular across the [[Western world]] in the 1950s and 1960s. Its simple, neutral design has also influenced many later typefaces. It has sometimes been sold as '''Standard''' or '''Basic Commercial''' in English-speaking countries.\n\n==Design characteristics==\n[[Image:Akzidenz-Grotesk variations.svg|thumb|Digital variants of Akzidenz-Grotesk, showing the slight inconsistencies and idiosyncrasies between different weights and widths.]]\nLike most sans-serifs, Akzidenz-Grotesk is 'monoline' in structure, with all strokes of the letter of similar width.

The first [[prototype]] was built in 1959. In 1961 the first sample series were built and starting from October 1963 the vehicles were produced in [[Lublin]], Poland by [[Fabryka Samochod\u00f3w Ci\u0119\u017carowych]]. [[Czechoslovakia]] supplied the [[driveline]] components, i.e. the engine, transmission and [[axle]]s. The first production vehicles were delivered in 1964 to both the [[Ludowe Wojsko Polskie|Polish Army]] and [[Czechoslovak People's Army|Czechoslovak Army]]. They were also acquired by the Hungarian army. Today they are gradually being replaced by newer vehicles.\n\n==Technology==\n[[File:SKOT 2A TBiU9 2.jpg|left|thumb|OT-64 SKOT in an amphibious assault exercise]]\n[[File:SKOT-2 AP.JPG|thumb|right|SKOT-2AP]]\nThe OT-64's engine, transmission, suspension and axles were produced in [[Czechoslovakia]]. The engine was produced by [[Tatra (company)|Tatra]]. The gearbox was manufactured by [[Praga (company)|Praga Hostiva\u0159]]. It has a pre-select Praga-Wilson gearbox, (5 forward +1 reverse gears.) A gear is selected using the gear stick then when the gear is required the left pedal (gear change action/clutch combined) is pressed to the floor, giving a hiss of air sound, on release of the pedal the dry plate clutch engages after about half the return spring controlled movement. The drive then passes to an auxiliary gearbox with low, neutral and high ratios which needs to be selected before moving off, for road/neutral/off-road use, this gives option to the driver of 10 forward and 2 reverse ratios. The gear change pedal is hydraulic and on action opens an air valve which causes the selected gear to engage. The armored hull and weapons were produced in Poland.\n\nThe OT-64 was the answer to the [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] [[BTR-60]]. Contrary to this, the OT-64 used a diesel set in place of a petrol engine. That diminished the danger of fire and at the same time increased the range. The main advantage in relation to the Russian counterpart was the full-armored interior. The entrance is at the rear of the vehicle via twin doors. The OT-64 had an NBC protection facility and night-vision equipment. It also has central inflation for all wheels which can be controlled by driver during a drive. The OT-64 was air-transportable and [[Amphibious vehicle|amphibious]], for the transport on [[water]] used two propellers installed at the back.\n\nSeveral variants were built. Some OT-64 were re-equipped for air defense or built as tank hunters. The latter used the [[AT-3 Sagger]] missile as a weapon.\n\n==Service history==\nOT-64 SKOT entered service with Polish and Czechoslovak armies in 1963. It was produced until the early 1970s. It is still in service in Poland and Slovakia, among other operated by the Slovak police.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.minv.sk/swift_data/source/mvsr/galerie/summit_eu_16092016/2/summit-ba-opatrenia-september2016%20(1).jpg?v=2|title=Photo of police SKOT vehicles used during the informal EU summit on September 16, 2016, in Bratislava.|last=|first=|date=2016-09-16|work=|access-date=2017-01-25|via=http://www.minv.sk/?predsednictvo-eu-mv&sprava=na-bezpecnost-pocas-neformalneho-summitu-eu-v-bratislave-dohliadalo-vyse-4-tisic-policajtov|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170202072137/http://www.minv.sk/swift_data/source/mvsr/galerie/summit_eu_16092016/2/summit-ba-opatrenia-september2016%20(1).jpg?v=2|archive-date=February 2, 2017|url-status=live}}</ref> Czech units were replaced in 2006 by new armoured vehicles [[Pandur II]] CZ.<ref name=\"fanda\"/> During the 1990s, Slovakia purchased hundreds of these units from the Czech Republic (150 in 1994, 100 in 1998).

The first [[prototype]] was built in 1959. In 1961 the first sample series were built and starting from October 1963 the vehicles were produced in [[Lublin]], Poland by [[Fabryka Samochod\u00f3w Ci\u0119\u017carowych]]. [[Czechoslovakia]] supplied the [[driveline]] components, i.e. the engine, transmission and [[axle]]s. The first production vehicles were delivered in 1964 to both the [[Ludowe Wojsko Polskie|Polish Army]] and [[Czechoslovak People's Army|Czechoslovak Army]]. They were also acquired by the Hungarian army. Today they are gradually being replaced by newer vehicles.\n\n==Technology==\n[[File:SKOT 2A TBiU9 2.jpg|left|thumb|OT-64 SKOT in an amphibious assault exercise]]\n[[File:SKOT-2 AP.JPG|thumb|right|SKOT-2AP]]\nThe OT-64's engine, transmission, suspension and axles were produced in [[Czechoslovakia]]. The engine was produced by [[Tatra (company)|Tatra]]. The gearbox was manufactured by [[Praga (company)|Praga Hostiva\u0159]]. It has a pre-select Praga-Wilson gearbox, (5 forward +1 reverse gears.) A gear is selected using the gear stick then when the gear is required the left pedal (gear change action/clutch combined) is pressed to the floor, giving a hiss of air sound, on release of the pedal the dry plate clutch engages after about half the return spring controlled movement. The drive then passes to an auxiliary gearbox with low, neutral and high ratios which needs to be selected before moving off, for road/neutral/off-road use, this gives option to the driver of 10 forward and 2 reverse ratios. The gear change pedal is hydraulic and on action opens an air valve which causes the selected gear to engage. The armored hull and weapons were produced in Poland.\n\nThe OT-64 was the answer to the [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] [[BTR-60]]. Contrary to this, the OT-64 used a diesel set in place of a petrol engine. That diminished the danger of fire and at the same time increased the range. The main advantage in relation to the Russian counterpart was the full-armored interior. The entrance is at the rear of the vehicle via twin doors. The OT-64 had an NBC protection facility and night-vision equipment. It also has central inflation for all wheels which can be controlled by driver during a drive. The OT-64 was air-transportable and [[Amphibious vehicle|amphibious]], for the transport on [[water]] used two propellers installed at the back.\n\nSeveral variants were built. Some OT-64 were re-equipped for air defense or built as tank hunters. The latter used the [[AT-3 Sagger]] missile as a weapon.\n\n==Service history==\nOT-64 SKOT entered service with Polish and Czechoslovak armies in 1963. It was produced until the early 1970s. It is still in service in Poland and Slovakia, among other operated by the Slovak police.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.minv.sk/swift_data/source/mvsr/galerie/summit_eu_16092016/2/summit-ba-opatrenia-september2016%20(1).jpg?v=2|title=Photo of police SKOT vehicles used during the informal EU summit on September 16, 2016, in Bratislava.|last=|first=|date=2016-09-16|work=|access-date=2017-01-25|via=http://www.minv.sk/?predsednictvo-eu-mv&sprava=na-bezpecnost-pocas-neformalneho-summitu-eu-v-bratislave-dohliadalo-vyse-4-tisic-policajtov|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170202072137/http://www.minv.sk/swift_data/source/mvsr/galerie/summit_eu_16092016/2/summit-ba-opatrenia-september2016%20(1).jpg?v=2|archive-date=February 2, 2017|url-status=live}}</ref> Czech units were replaced in 2006 by new armoured vehicles [[Pandur II]] CZ.<ref name=\"fanda\"/> During the 1990s, Slovakia purchased hundreds of these units from the Czech Republic (150 in 1994, 100 in 1998).
