Although mainland Yemen is in the southern Arabian Peninsula and thus part of [[Asia]], and its [[Hanish Islands]] and [[Perim]] in the Red Sea are associated with Asia, the [[archipelago]] of Socotra, which lies east of the horn of [[Somalia]] and is much closer to Africa than to Asia.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.worldwildlife.org/ecoregions/at1318|work=WorldWildlife.org|publisher=World Wildlife Fund|title=Islands east of the Horn of Africa and south of Yemen|access-date=4 February 2019}}</ref>\n\n=== Regions and climate ===\n{{multiple image |align=right |direction=vertical |width=\n |image1=Water reservoir, yemen.jpg |caption1=A water reservoir in [[Jabal Haraz]]\n |image2=Haraz 200612 Yemen-115 (353667843).jpg |caption2=A terraced side of one of the Haraz Mountains in [[Al Mahwit Governorate]] near [[Jabal An-Nabi Shu'ayb]] (the highest mountain in the [[Arabian Peninsula]]), west of [[Sanaa]]\n}}\n\nYemen can be divided geographically into four main regions: the coastal plains in the west, the western highlands, the eastern highlands, and the [[Rub' al Khali]] in the east. The [[Tihamah|Tih\u0101mah]] (\"hot lands\" or \"hot earth\") form a very arid and flat coastal plain along Yemen's entire Red Sea coastline. Despite the aridity, the presence of many lagoons makes this region very marshy and a suitable breeding ground for [[malaria]] [[mosquito]]s. Extensive crescent-shaped sand dunes are present. The evaporation in the Tihamah is so great that streams from the highlands never reach the sea, but they do contribute to extensive [[groundwater]] reserves. Today, these are heavily exploited for agricultural use. Near the village of [[Madar, Yemen|Madar]] about {{convert|50|km|mi|-1|abbr=on}} north of Sana'a, [[dinosaur]] footprints were found, indicating that the area was once a muddy flat. The Tihamah ends abruptly at the [[escarpment]] of the western highlands. This area, now heavily [[terrace (agriculture)|terraced]] to meet the demand for food, receives the highest rainfall in Arabia, rapidly increasing from {{convert|100|mm|in|1|abbr=on}} per year to about {{convert|760|mm|in|1|abbr=on}} in Taiz and over {{convert|1000|mm|in|1|abbr=on}} in Ibb. Temperatures are hot in the day, but fall dramatically at night. Perennial streams occur in the highlands, but these never reach the sea because of high evaporation in the Tihamah.{{citation needed|date=April 2019}}\n\nThe central highlands are an extensive high plateau over {{convert|2000|m|ft|0|abbr=on}} in elevation. This area is drier than the western highlands because of rain-shadow influences, but still receives sufficient rain in wet years for extensive cropping. Water storage allows for [[irrigation]] and the growing of [[wheat]] and [[barley]]. Sana'a is in this region.

The Sudanian element\u2014characterized by relatively high rainfall\u2014dominates the western mountains and parts of the highland plains. The Saharo-Arabian element dominates in the coastal plains, eastern mountain, and the eastern and northern desert plains. A high percentage of Yemen plants belong to tropical African plants of Sudanian regions. Among the Sudanian element species, the following may be mentioned: ''[[Ficus]]'' spp., ''[[Acacia mellifera]], [[Grewia villosa]], [[Commiphora]]'' spp., ''[[Rose|Rosa]] abyssinica'', ''[[Cadaba]] farinosa'' and others.<ref>Abdul Wali A. al-Khulaidi, ''Flora of Yemen'', Sustainable Environmental Management Program (YEM/97/100), Republic of Yemen, June 2000, p. 7</ref> Among the Saharo-Arabian species, these may be mentioned: ''[[Panicum turgidum]], [[Aerva javanica]], [[Zygophyllum]] simplex, [[Fagonia]] indica, [[Salsola]]'' spp., ''[[Acacia tortilis]], A. hamulos, [[Acacia ehrenbergiana|A. ehrenbergiana]], [[Phoenix dactylifera]], [[Hyphaene thebaica]], [[Capparis decidua]], [[Salvadora persica]], [[Balanites aegyptiaca]]'', and many others.

Under the 1991 constitution, an elected President, an elected 301-seat [[Assembly of Representatives of Yemen|Assembly of Representatives]], and an appointed 111-member [[Shura|Shura Council]] share power. The [[President of Yemen|President]] is the [[head of state]], and the [[Prime Minister of Yemen|Prime Minister]] is the [[head of government]]. In Sana'a, a [[Supreme Political Council]] (not recognized internationally) forms the government.\n\nThe 1991 constitution provides that the president be elected by popular vote from at least two candidates endorsed by at least 15 members of the Parliament. The prime minister, in turn, is appointed by the president and must be approved by two-thirds of the Parliament. The presidential term of office is seven years, and the parliamentary term of elected office is six years. [[Suffrage]] is universal for people age 18 and older, but only Muslims may hold elected office.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://2001-2009.state.gov/g/drl/rls/irf/2005/51614.htm |title=Yemen |work=State.gov |date=8 November 2005 |accessdate=17 October 2010}}</ref>\n\nPresident [[Ali Abdullah Saleh]] became the first elected President in reunified Yemen in 1999 (though he had been President of unified Yemen since 1990 and president of North Yemen since 1978).

The former northern and southern legal codes have been unified. The legal system includes separate commercial courts and a Supreme Court based in Sana'a. [[Sharia]] is the main source of laws, with many court cases being debated according to the religious basis of law and many judges being religious scholars as well as legal authorities. The Prison Authority Organization Act, Republican decree no. 48 (1981), and Prison Act regulations, provide the legal framework for management of the country's prison system.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Mangan|first1=Fiona|title=Prisons in Yemen|date=March 2015|publisher=United States Institute of Peace|location=Washington, DC|page=9|url=https://purl.fdlp.gov/GPO/gpo58370|accessdate=21 June 2015}}</ref>\n\n===Foreign relations===\n{{Main|Foreign relations of Yemen}}\n[[File:Ali Abdullah Saleh meets Donald H.

The country's relations with Saudi Arabia were defined by the [[Taif Agreement]] of 1934, which delineated the northernmost part of the border between the two kingdoms and set the framework for commercial and other intercourse. The Taif Agreement has been renewed periodically in 20-year increments, and its validity was reaffirmed in 1995. Relations with the British colonial authorities in Aden and the south were usually tense.\n\nThe Soviet and Chinese Aid Missions established in 1958 and 1959 were the first important non-Muslim presences in North Yemen. Following the September 1962 revolution, the [[Yemen Arab Republic]] became closely allied with and heavily dependent upon Egypt. Saudi Arabia aided the royalists in their attempt to defeat the Republicans and did not recognize the Yemen Arab Republic until 1970. At the same time, Saudi Arabia maintained direct contact with Yemeni tribes, which sometimes strained its official relations with the Yemeni Government. Saudi Arabia remained hostile to any form of political and social reform in Yemen<ref>{{cite book |last=[[Robin Leonard Bidwell|Bidwell]] |first=Robin |title=The Two Yemens |url=https://archive.org/details/twoyemens00bidw|url-access=registration|year=1983 |publisher=Longman and Westview Press |location=Harlow |isbn=978-0-865-31295-1 |pages=[https://archive.org/details/twoyemens00bidw/page/243 243\u2013244]}}</ref> and continued to provide financial support for tribal elites.<ref>F.

After unification, the Republic of Yemen was accepted as a member of the ACC in place of its YAR predecessor. In the wake of the Persian Gulf crisis, the ACC has remained inactive.

Some agricultural practices are drying the Sana'a Basin and displaced vital crops, which has resulted in increasing food prices.

Yemen had reserves of foreign exchange and gold of around $5.538 billion in 2013. Its inflation rate over the same period based on consumer prices was 11.8%. Yemen's external debt totaled $7.806 billion.<ref name=\"CIA\"/>\n\n=== International relations ===\nBeginning in the mid-1950s, the [[Soviet Union]] and China provided large-scale assistance. For example, China and the United States are involved with the expansion of the [[Sana'a International Airport]]. In the south, pre-independence economic activity was overwhelmingly concentrated in the port city of Aden. The seaborne transit trade, which the port relied upon, collapsed with the closure of the [[Suez Canal]] and Britain's withdrawal from Aden in 1967.\n\nSince the conclusion of the war, the government made an agreement with the [[International Monetary Fund]] (IMF) to implement a [[structural adjustment]] program. Phase one of the program included major financial and monetary reforms, including floating the currency, reducing the budget deficit, and cutting subsidies. Phase two addresses structural issues, such as civil service reform.\n\nIn early 1995, the government of Yemen launched an economic, financial, and administrative reform program (EFARP) with the support of the [[World Bank]] and the IMF, as well as international donors. These programs had a positive impact on Yemen's economy and led to the reduction of the budget deficit to less than 3% of gross domestic product during the period 1995\u20131999 and the correction of macro-financial imbalances.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.imf.org/external/NP/prsp/2000/yem/01/123100.pdf |title=Republic of Yemen: Interim Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper |publisher=International Monetary Fund |date=December 2000 |accessdate=21 March 2010}}</ref> The real growth rate in the non-oil sector rose by 5.6% from 1995 to 1997.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.imf.org/external/np/pfp/1999/yemen/index.htm#I |title=Republic of Yemen Enhanced Structural Adjustment Facility Medium-Term Economic and Financial Policy Framework Paper 1999\u20132001 |publisher=International Monetary Fund |date=5 March 1999 |accessdate=13 December 2013}}</ref>\n\n=== Water supply and sanitation ===\n{{Main|Water supply and sanitation in Yemen}}\n\nA key challenge is severe [[Environmental impacts of the Yemeni Civil War (2015\u2013present)|water scarcity]], especially in the Highlands, prompting ''[[The Times]]'' to write \"Yemen could become first nation to run out of water.\"<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/yemen-could-become-first-nation-to-run-out-of-water-6jvzddjrl0v|title=Yemen could become first nation to run out of water|last=Evans|first=Judith|date=21 October 2009|work=The Times|access-date=11 March 2017|archive-url=https://archive.today/20170311100235/http://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/yemen-could-become-first-nation-to-run-out-of-water-6jvzddjrl0v|archive-date=11 March 2017|url-status=live|language=en-gb}}</ref> A second key challenge is a high level of poverty, making it difficult to recover the costs of service provision. Access to water supply sanitation is as low as in some sub-Saharan African countries. Yemen is both the poorest country and the most water-scarce country in the [[Arab world]]. Third, the capacity of sector institutions to plan, build, operate and maintain infrastructure remains limited. Last but not least the security situation makes it even more difficult to improve or even maintain existing levels of service.\n\nThe average Yemeni has access to only 140 cubic meters of water per year (101 gallons per day) for all uses, while the Middle Eastern average is 1000 m<sup>3</sup>/yr, and the internationally defined threshold for water stress is 1700 cubic meters per year.<ref>{{cite web|url = http://www.grida.no/climate/ipcc_tar/wg2/180.htm|title = Climate Change 2001: Impacts, Adaptation and Vulnerability|accessdate = 25 June 2015|url-status=dead|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20150626113733/http://www.grida.no/climate/ipcc_tar/wg2/180.htm|archivedate = 26 June 2015|df = dmy-all}}</ref> Yemen's groundwater is the main source of water in the country but the water tables have dropped severely leaving Yemen without a viable source of water.

Both amateur and professional (government-sponsored) theatre troupes perform in the country's major urban centres. Many of Yemen's significant poets and authors, like Ali Ahmed Ba Kathir, Muhammad al-Sharafi, and [[Wajdi al-Ahdal]], have written dramatic works; poems, novels, and short stories by Yemeni authors like [[Mohammad Abdul-Wali]] and [[Abdulaziz Al-Maqaleh]] have also been adapted for the stage. There have been Yemeni productions of plays by Arab authors such as [[Tawfiq al-Hakim]] and [[Saadallah Wannous]] and by Western authors, including [[Shakespeare]], [[Pirandello]], [[Brecht]], and [[Tennessee Williams]]. Historically speaking, the southern port city of Aden is the cradle of Yemeni theatre; in recent decades the capital, Sana'a, has hosted numerous theatre festivals, often in conjunction with [[World Theatre Day]].\n\n===Sport===\n{{more citations needed|date=January 2019}}\n[[Association football|Football]] is the most popular sport in Yemen. The [[Yemen Football Association]] is a member of [[FIFA]] and [[Asian Football Confederation|AFC]]. The [[Yemen national football team|Yemeni national football team]] participates internationally. The country also hosts many football clubs. They compete in the national and international leagues.\n\nYemen's mountains provide many opportunities for outdoor sports, such as [[Mountain biking|biking]], [[rock climbing]], [[trekking]], [[hiking]], and other more challenging sports, including [[mountain climbing]].

Socotra island is home to some of the best surfing destinations in the world.\n\n[[Camel jumping]] is a traditional sport that is becoming increasingly popular among the Zaraniq tribe on the west coast of Yemen in a desert plain by the [[Red Sea]].

It played an important role for many centuries because of its university, which was a centre of learning for the whole Arab and Islamic world. Algebra is said to have been invented there in the early 9th century by the little-known scholar [[Al-Jazari]].\n\nThe latest addition to Yemen's list of World Heritage Sites is the [[Socotra]] Archipelago. Mentioned by [[Marco Polo]] in the 13th century, this remote and isolated archipelago consists of four islands and two rocky islets delineating the southern limit of the Gulf of Aden. The site has a rich biodiversity. Nowhere else in the world do 37% of Socotra's 825 plants, 90% of its reptiles and 95% of its snails occur. It is home to 192 bird species, 253 species of coral, 730 species of coastal fish, and 300 species of crab and lobster, as well as a range of ''[[Aloe]]s'' and the Dragon's Blood Tree (''[[Dracaena cinnabari]]'').

Yemen's public healthcare system is compiled of four levels: (1) 2929 primary health care units (2) 184 district hospitals (3) 53 general hospitals (4) two specialist referral hospitals. However, many of these facilities lack resources and employees due to the small budget spent on public healthcare in Yemen.<ref name=\":02\" /> However, in 2002 Yemen created the District [[Healthcare]] System (DHS) in order to deliver primary health care through community-based services, which in the end failed due to poor management.

Yemen then made significant progress, with the rate falling to 44.5 children per 1000 births in 2015. Subsequently, the ongoing [[2016\u201319 Yemen cholera outbreak|cholera outbreak]] caused the death toll of children to rise. As of 2018, more than 20 million Yemeni people are in need of humanitarian assistance, including 9 million children.\n\nMalnutrition is one of the leading causes of child mortality. By 2018, about two million Yemeni children suffered from acute malnutrition, as a result of the civil war consuming their nation's economy. Geographically, Yemen also has the world's most depleted water sources. According to UNICEF, nearly 462,000 children are suffering from [[Severe Acute Malnutrition]].

A reported 6,500 children have been killed or injured from violence as the country's infrastructure collapses. It is reported that upwards of 800 children being recruited to participate in the civil war.\n\n===Disease===\nCholera has broken out within Yemen because of its poor infrastructure that deteriorated due wide spread war in the country. Yemen faces issues in control and provisions of fresh, clean water as Yemen does not have the capacity to create the infrastructure needed to provide it; thus, people are forced to obtain unsanitary water from rivers, lakes, and wells. Cholera is prominently found in contaminated drinking water, making the Yemeni people, especially children, the most prone to such a disease. There have been more than 815,000 suspected cases of Cholera in Yemen over the past three years, 60% percent of them being children.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2017/oct/12/yemen-cholera-outbreak-worst-in-history-1-million-cases-by-end-of-year|title=Yemen's cholera outbreak now the worst in history as millionth case looms|first=Kate|last=Lyons|date=12 October 2017|via=www.theguardian.com}}</ref> Cholera can be found throughout a majority of Yemen, mostly concentrated in the cities closest to water.

The coalition included the [[United Arab Emirates]], [[Kuwait]], [[Qatar]], [[Bahrain]], [[Jordan]], [[Morocco]], [[Sudan]], [[Egypt]], and [[Pakistan]]. The United States announced that it was assisting with intelligence, targeting, and logistics. Saudi Arabia and Egypt would not rule out ground operations.

The [[Tihamah|Tih\u0101mah]] (\"hot lands\" or \"hot earth\") form a very arid and flat coastal plain along Yemen's entire Red Sea coastline. Despite the aridity, the presence of many lagoons makes this region very marshy and a suitable breeding ground for [[malaria]] [[mosquito]]s. Extensive crescent-shaped sand dunes are present. The evaporation in the Tihamah is so great that streams from the highlands never reach the sea, but they do contribute to extensive [[groundwater]] reserves. Today, these are heavily exploited for agricultural use. Near the village of [[Madar, Yemen|Madar]] about {{convert|50|km|mi|-1|abbr=on}} north of Sana'a, [[dinosaur]] footprints were found, indicating that the area was once a muddy flat. The Tihamah ends abruptly at the [[escarpment]] of the western highlands. This area, now heavily [[terrace (agriculture)|terraced]] to meet the demand for food, receives the highest rainfall in Arabia, rapidly increasing from {{convert|100|mm|in|1|abbr=on}} per year to about {{convert|760|mm|in|1|abbr=on}} in Taiz and over {{convert|1000|mm|in|1|abbr=on}} in Ibb. Temperatures are hot in the day, but fall dramatically at night. Perennial streams occur in the highlands, but these never reach the sea because of high evaporation in the Tihamah.{{citation needed|date=April 2019}}\n\nThe central highlands are an extensive high plateau over {{convert|2000|m|ft|0|abbr=on}} in elevation. This area is drier than the western highlands because of rain-shadow influences, but still receives sufficient rain in wet years for extensive cropping. Water storage allows for [[irrigation]] and the growing of [[wheat]] and [[barley]]. Sana'a is in this region. The highest point in Yemen and Arabia is [[Jabal An-Nabi Shu'ayb]], at about {{convert|3666|m|ft|0|abbr=on}}.<ref name=\"Burrows2010\"/><ref name=\"Laughlin2008\">{{cite book |last=McLaughlin |first=Daniel |title=Yemen |publisher=[[Bradt Travel Guides]] |chapter=1: Background |page=3 |isbn=978-1-8416-2212-5 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=eQvhZaEVzjcC&pg |year=2008|ref={{harvid|McLaughlin|2008}} }}</ref>\n\nYemen's portion of the Rub al Khali desert in the east is much lower, generally below {{convert|1000|m|ft|0|abbr=on}}, and receives almost no rain.

The Sudanian element\u2014characterized by relatively high rainfall\u2014dominates the western mountains and parts of the highland plains. The Saharo-Arabian element dominates in the coastal plains, eastern mountain, and the eastern and northern desert plains. A high percentage of Yemen plants belong to tropical African plants of Sudanian regions.

Under the 1991 constitution, an elected President, an elected 301-seat [[Assembly of Representatives of Yemen|Assembly of Representatives]], and an appointed 111-member [[Shura|Shura Council]] share power. The [[President of Yemen|President]] is the [[head of state]], and the [[Prime Minister of Yemen|Prime Minister]] is the [[head of government]]. In Sana'a, a [[Supreme Political Council]] (not recognized internationally) forms the government.\n\nThe 1991 constitution provides that the president be elected by popular vote from at least two candidates endorsed by at least 15 members of the Parliament. The prime minister, in turn, is appointed by the president and must be approved by two-thirds of the Parliament. The presidential term of office is seven years, and the parliamentary term of elected office is six years. [[Suffrage]] is universal for people age 18 and older, but only Muslims may hold elected office.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://2001-2009.state.gov/g/drl/rls/irf/2005/51614.htm |title=Yemen |work=State.gov |date=8 November 2005 |accessdate=17 October 2010}}</ref>\n\nPresident [[Ali Abdullah Saleh]] became the first elected President in reunified Yemen in 1999 (though he had been President of unified Yemen since 1990 and president of North Yemen since 1978).

The former northern and southern legal codes have been unified. The legal system includes separate commercial courts and a Supreme Court based in Sana'a. [[Sharia]] is the main source of laws, with many court cases being debated according to the religious basis of law and many judges being religious scholars as well as legal authorities. The Prison Authority Organization Act, Republican decree no. 48 (1981), and Prison Act regulations, provide the legal framework for management of the country's prison system.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Mangan|first1=Fiona|title=Prisons in Yemen|date=March 2015|publisher=United States Institute of Peace|location=Washington, DC|page=9|url=https://purl.fdlp.gov/GPO/gpo58370|accessdate=21 June 2015}}</ref>\n\n===Foreign relations===\n{{Main|Foreign relations of Yemen}}\n[[File:Ali Abdullah Saleh meets Donald H.

The country's relations with Saudi Arabia were defined by the [[Taif Agreement]] of 1934, which delineated the northernmost part of the border between the two kingdoms and set the framework for commercial and other intercourse. The Taif Agreement has been renewed periodically in 20-year increments, and its validity was reaffirmed in 1995. Relations with the British colonial authorities in Aden and the south were usually tense.\n\nThe Soviet and Chinese Aid Missions established in 1958 and 1959 were the first important non-Muslim presences in North Yemen. Following the September 1962 revolution, the [[Yemen Arab Republic]] became closely allied with and heavily dependent upon Egypt. Saudi Arabia aided the royalists in their attempt to defeat the Republicans and did not recognize the Yemen Arab Republic until 1970. At the same time, Saudi Arabia maintained direct contact with Yemeni tribes, which sometimes strained its official relations with the Yemeni Government.

After unification, the Republic of Yemen was accepted as a member of the ACC in place of its YAR predecessor. In the wake of the Persian Gulf crisis, the ACC has remained inactive.

Some agricultural practices are drying the Sana'a Basin and displaced vital crops, which has resulted in increasing food prices.

Yemen had reserves of foreign exchange and gold of around $5.538 billion in 2013. Its inflation rate over the same period based on consumer prices was 11.8%. Yemen's external debt totaled $7.806 billion.<ref name=\"CIA\"/>\n\n=== International relations ===\nBeginning in the mid-1950s, the [[Soviet Union]] and China provided large-scale assistance. For example, China and the United States are involved with the expansion of the [[Sana'a International Airport]]. In the south, pre-independence economic activity was overwhelmingly concentrated in the port city of Aden. The seaborne transit trade, which the port relied upon, collapsed with the closure of the [[Suez Canal]] and Britain's withdrawal from Aden in 1967.\n\nSince the conclusion of the war, the government made an agreement with the [[International Monetary Fund]] (IMF) to implement a [[structural adjustment]] program. Phase one of the program included major financial and monetary reforms, including floating the currency, reducing the budget deficit, and cutting subsidies. Phase two addresses structural issues, such as civil service reform.\n\nIn early 1995, the government of Yemen launched an economic, financial, and administrative reform program (EFARP) with the support of the [[World Bank]] and the IMF, as well as international donors. These programs had a positive impact on Yemen's economy and led to the reduction of the budget deficit to less than 3% of gross domestic product during the period 1995\u20131999 and the correction of macro-financial imbalances.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.imf.org/external/NP/prsp/2000/yem/01/123100.pdf |title=Republic of Yemen: Interim Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper |publisher=International Monetary Fund |date=December 2000 |accessdate=21 March 2010}}</ref> The real growth rate in the non-oil sector rose by 5.6% from 1995 to 1997.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.imf.org/external/np/pfp/1999/yemen/index.htm#I |title=Republic of Yemen Enhanced Structural Adjustment Facility Medium-Term Economic and Financial Policy Framework Paper 1999\u20132001 |publisher=International Monetary Fund |date=5 March 1999 |accessdate=13 December 2013}}</ref>\n\n=== Water supply and sanitation ===\n{{Main|Water supply and sanitation in Yemen}}\n\nA key challenge is severe [[Environmental impacts of the Yemeni Civil War (2015\u2013present)|water scarcity]], especially in the Highlands, prompting ''[[The Times]]'' to write \"Yemen could become first nation to run out of water.\"<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/yemen-could-become-first-nation-to-run-out-of-water-6jvzddjrl0v|title=Yemen could become first nation to run out of water|last=Evans|first=Judith|date=21 October 2009|work=The Times|access-date=11 March 2017|archive-url=https://archive.today/20170311100235/http://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/yemen-could-become-first-nation-to-run-out-of-water-6jvzddjrl0v|archive-date=11 March 2017|url-status=live|language=en-gb}}</ref> A second key challenge is a high level of poverty, making it difficult to recover the costs of service provision. Access to water supply sanitation is as low as in some sub-Saharan African countries. Yemen is both the poorest country and the most water-scarce country in the [[Arab world]]. Third, the capacity of sector institutions to plan, build, operate and maintain infrastructure remains limited. Last but not least the security situation makes it even more difficult to improve or even maintain existing levels of service.\n\nThe average Yemeni has access to only 140 cubic meters of water per year (101 gallons per day) for all uses, while the Middle Eastern average is 1000 m<sup>3</sup>/yr, and the internationally defined threshold for water stress is 1700 cubic meters per year.<ref>{{cite web|url = http://www.grida.no/climate/ipcc_tar/wg2/180.htm|title = Climate Change 2001: Impacts, Adaptation and Vulnerability|accessdate = 25 June 2015|url-status=dead|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20150626113733/http://www.grida.no/climate/ipcc_tar/wg2/180.htm|archivedate = 26 June 2015|df = dmy-all}}</ref> Yemen's groundwater is the main source of water in the country but the water tables have dropped severely leaving Yemen without a viable source of water.

Both amateur and professional (government-sponsored) theatre troupes perform in the country's major urban centres. Many of Yemen's significant poets and authors, like Ali Ahmed Ba Kathir, Muhammad al-Sharafi, and [[Wajdi al-Ahdal]], have written dramatic works; poems, novels, and short stories by Yemeni authors like [[Mohammad Abdul-Wali]] and [[Abdulaziz Al-Maqaleh]] have also been adapted for the stage. There have been Yemeni productions of plays by Arab authors such as [[Tawfiq al-Hakim]] and [[Saadallah Wannous]] and by Western authors, including [[Shakespeare]], [[Pirandello]], [[Brecht]], and [[Tennessee Williams]]. Historically speaking, the southern port city of Aden is the cradle of Yemeni theatre; in recent decades the capital, Sana'a, has hosted numerous theatre festivals, often in conjunction with [[World Theatre Day]].\n\n===Sport===\n{{more citations needed|date=January 2019}}\n[[Association football|Football]] is the most popular sport in Yemen. The [[Yemen Football Association]] is a member of [[FIFA]] and [[Asian Football Confederation|AFC]]. The [[Yemen national football team|Yemeni national football team]] participates internationally. The country also hosts many football clubs. They compete in the national and international leagues.\n\nYemen's mountains provide many opportunities for outdoor sports, such as [[Mountain biking|biking]], [[rock climbing]], [[trekking]], [[hiking]], and other more challenging sports, including [[mountain climbing]].

Socotra island is home to some of the best surfing destinations in the world.\n\n[[Camel jumping]] is a traditional sport that is becoming increasingly popular among the Zaraniq tribe on the west coast of Yemen in a desert plain by the [[Red Sea]].

It played an important role for many centuries because of its university, which was a centre of learning for the whole Arab and Islamic world. Algebra is said to have been invented there in the early 9th century by the little-known scholar [[Al-Jazari]].\n\nThe latest addition to Yemen's list of World Heritage Sites is the [[Socotra]] Archipelago. Mentioned by [[Marco Polo]] in the 13th century, this remote and isolated archipelago consists of four islands and two rocky islets delineating the southern limit of the Gulf of Aden. The site has a rich biodiversity. Nowhere else in the world do 37% of Socotra's 825 plants, 90% of its reptiles and 95% of its snails occur. It is home to 192 bird species, 253 species of coral, 730 species of coastal fish, and 300 species of crab and lobster, as well as a range of ''[[Aloe]]s'' and the Dragon's Blood Tree (''[[Dracaena cinnabari]]'').

Yemen's public healthcare system is compiled of four levels: (1) 2929 primary health care units (2) 184 district hospitals (3) 53 general hospitals (4) two specialist referral hospitals. However, many of these facilities lack resources and employees due to the small budget spent on public healthcare in Yemen.<ref name=\":02\" /> However, in 2002 Yemen created the District [[Healthcare]] System (DHS) in order to deliver primary health care through community-based services, which in the end failed due to poor management.

Yemen faces issues in control and provisions of fresh, clean water as Yemen does not have the capacity to create the infrastructure needed to provide it; thus, people are forced to obtain unsanitary water from rivers, lakes, and wells. Cholera is prominently found in contaminated drinking water, making the Yemeni people, especially children, the most prone to such a disease.

It was released on 15 March 2013 as a single from the re-release of Guetta's fifth studio album, ''[[Nothing but the Beat]]'' (2011). This is the second collaboration between Guetta and Akon since \"[[Sexy Bitch]]\" in 2009. All three artists co-wrote the song along with Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Riesterer and Giorgio Tuinfort, both of whom produced the song with Guetta. Akon's vocals were written and recorded at [[Sonic Vista Studios]] in [[Ibiza]] in July 2012.{{Citation needed|date=March 2014}} The song samples the 1998 Eurodance song \"[[Better Off Alone (Alice Deejay song)|Better Off Alone]]\" by [[Alice Deejay]] and \"In My Dreams (XXL Remix)\" by [[Noemi (singer)|Noemi]]. \"Play Hard\" peaked at number six on the [[UK Singles Chart]], thus becoming his fourteenth top 10 hit in the UK as a lead artist. It also charted within the top 10 of the charts in several other countries including Austria, Belgium, Czech Republic, France, Germany, Ireland, Israel, Italy, Luxembourg, Poland, Scotland, Slovakia, South Korea, Spain and Switzerland; as well as the top 20 in Australia, Denmark, Finland, Iceland and New Zealand.\n\nGuetta reported on [[Twitter]] shortly before the release that he planned to release an edited version of \"Play Hard\" as the next single from ''Nothing but the Beat 2.0'' for a long while, which would make it the tenth single from ''Nothing but the Beat''.<ref>{{cite web|title=Back to the studio on Monday to finish the new version of play hard , my next single.

Born near [[Savannah, Georgia]] at [[Bonaventure Plantation]] in the early 1760s (he was the first native-born Georgian governor after the state was admitted into the Union) to Mary Mullryne and Josiah Tattnall, he studied at [[Eton School]] before joining [[Anthony Wayne]]'s troops at Ebenezer during the [[American Revolutionary War]].<ref>Smith, p. 343</ref>  After the war, he was elected brigadier general of the 1st Regiment in the [[Georgia Militia]].

Mullryne, who also built the third [[Tybee Lighthouse]] in 1773, established a small family graveyard on the grounds, which eventually formed the nucleus of the present-day [[Bonaventure Cemetery]].

Josiah Tattnall joined the [[Continental army]] under General [[Anthony Wayne]], helping remove [[Capture of Savannah|Savannah]] from British rule. After the war, Tattnall bought back a portion of Bonaventure from [[John Habersham]] and continued his interest in the military. He commanded the Georgia militia in 1787 and led troops against the [[Creek Indians]] in 1788 and 1793. He was captain of the Chatham Artillery, the oldest militia unit in Georgia, and later colonel of an infantry regiment.

Jackson resigned his position as [[U.S. senator]] to return to the Georgia General Assembly, where he and Tattnall led the campaign against the sale of the Yazoo lands. After the Rescinding Act of 1796 was passed, Tattnall was elected by the General Assembly to take Jackson's Senate seat, where he served from 1796 to 1799.\n\nAfter serving in the U.S. Senate, Tattnall returned to Georgia and to his beloved Bonaventure. He was elected [[List of Governors of Georgia|governor]], but only served for one year. During his administration, the [[University of Georgia]] (formerly [[Franklin College of Arts and Sciences|Franklin College]]) moved to its present campus in [[Athens, Georgia|Athens]], and the Hawkins Line was run by [[Benjamin Hawkins]], establishing Georgia's northern border with the [[Cherokee Nation]].

Born near [[Savannah, Georgia]] at [[Bonaventure Plantation]] in the early 1760s (he was the first native-born Georgian governor after the state was admitted into the Union) to Mary Mullryne and Josiah Tattnall, he studied at [[Eton School]] before joining [[Anthony Wayne]]'s troops at Ebenezer during the [[American Revolutionary War]].<ref>Smith, p. 343</ref>  After the war, he was elected brigadier general of the 1st Regiment in the [[Georgia Militia]].

Mullryne, who also built the third [[Tybee Lighthouse]] in 1773, established a small family graveyard on the grounds, which eventually formed the nucleus of the present-day [[Bonaventure Cemetery]]. Bonaventure was one of the largest structures in the colony of Georgia.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Pressly|first1=Paul M.|title=On the rim of the Caribbean : colonial Georgia and the British Atlantic world|date=2013|publisher=University of Georgia Press|location=Athens|isbn=9780820335674|page=190|url=http://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=e000xna&AN=516915&site=eds-live&scope=site&ebv=EB&ppid=pp_190|accessdate=June 10, 2016}}</ref>\n\nTattnall and his family left Georgia at the outbreak of the [[American Revolutionary War]].

Josiah Tattnall joined the [[Continental army]] under General [[Anthony Wayne]], helping remove [[Capture of Savannah|Savannah]] from British rule. After the war, Tattnall bought back a portion of Bonaventure from [[John Habersham]] and continued his interest in the military. He commanded the Georgia militia in 1787 and led troops against the [[Creek Indians]] in 1788 and 1793. He was captain of the Chatham Artillery, the oldest militia unit in Georgia, and later colonel of an infantry regiment.

Jackson resigned his position as [[U.S. senator]] to return to the Georgia General Assembly, where he and Tattnall led the campaign against the sale of the Yazoo lands. After the Rescinding Act of 1796 was passed, Tattnall was elected by the General Assembly to take Jackson's Senate seat, where he served from 1796 to 1799.\n\nAfter serving in the U.S. Senate, Tattnall returned to Georgia and to his beloved Bonaventure. He was elected [[List of Governors of Georgia|governor]], but only served for one year. During his administration, the [[University of Georgia]] (formerly [[Franklin College of Arts and Sciences|Franklin College]]) moved to its present campus in [[Athens, Georgia|Athens]], and the Hawkins Line was run by [[Benjamin Hawkins]], establishing Georgia's northern border with the [[Cherokee Nation]]. Tattnall wrote a letter to President [[Thomas Jefferson]] in 1802, seeking guidance on the situation.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Tattnall|first1=Josiah|title=To Thomas Jefferson from Josiah Tattnall Jr., 20 July 1802|url=https://founders.archives.gov/documents/Jefferson/01-38-02-0102|website=Founders Online|publisher=National Archives|accessdate=May 17, 2016}}</ref> The Western border with the [[Creek Indians|Creeks]] was yet to be solidified, as evidenced by a letter from the Justices of the Inferior Court and Justices of the Peace for [[Camden County, Georgia]] on June 12, 1802.<ref>{{cite web|last1=King|first1=Thomas|title=[Letter] 1802 June 12, St. Mary's, [Georgia to] Josiah Tattnall, Governor [of Georgia], Savannah / Tho[ma]s King . . .

The couple had several children, but only three lived to adulthood.

Reference to this can be found in an inscription of his son, [[Rana (title)|Rana]] Hathad or Hardatt, dated v.s 1162 (A.D.1105) According to bardic sources such as the khyat of Muhnot Nainsi, Hathad was fifth in the line of the ruling family of [[Eastern Ganga Dynasty|Ganga]] or Dhandha through the latter's son [[Indra]], while another bardic account make the Mohils descendants of Vachhra or Kanha, both sons of Ganga.\n<ref>Director (Muslim Epigraphy), Archaeological Survey of India, Nagpur.</ref>\n\n== Location ==\n\nThe Mohil Chauhans possibly ruled over the Chhapar-Dronapur, Ladnun parganas, which are near modern Gopalpur in the [[Churu]] District of [[Rajasthan]].<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?ei=YjGxTYebM5CYvAOdtdSRBw&ct=result&id=AZIMAQAAMAAJ&dq=mohil+rajputs&q=mohil Mediaeval history of Rajasthan \u2013 Google Books<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref><ref>Mediaeval history of Rajasthan, Volume 1</ref>\n\nAccording to some contemporary sources<!-- needs references -->Chhapar -Dronapur was conquered by the [[Rathod]]s of [[Jodhpur]] in 1474 A.D., but the Ladnun pargana continued to be held by the Mohil chiefs, one of whom was Rao Jai Singh, granted land to a bard, Jasudan, son of the poet Samaur Teja.<!-- needs references -->\n\n==Conversion to Islam==\n\nAccording to local tradition, the ruler of Ladaun region, [[Raja|Rao]] Jai Singh, was once watching a group of women passing through the town gate to fetch water. A menacing bull blocked the road. One of the women, who was a [[Muslim]], took the bull in hand and pushed it out of the way. The Rao was greatly impressed by the woman's show of courage and valour. Thinking that the offspring of such a brave woman would be as brave, the Raja formally proposed marriage with her to her father.

They compete in [[Major League Baseball]] (MLB) as a member club of the [[American League]] (AL) [[American League West|West division]]. In 2020, they will move to the new [[Globe Life Field]] after having played at [[Globe Life Park in Arlington]] from 1994 to 2019. The team's name is borrowed from the famous [[Texas Ranger Division|law enforcement agency]] of the same name.\n\nThe franchise was established in 1961 as the '''Washington Senators''', an [[expansion team]] awarded to [[Washington, D.C.]], after the city's first AL ballclub, the [[History of the Washington Senators (1901\u201360)|second Washington Senators]], moved to [[Minnesota]] and became the [[Minnesota Twins|Twins]] (the [[Washington Senators (1891\u201399)|original Washington Senators]] played primarily in the [[National League]] during the 1890s). After the {{MLBy|1971}} season, the new Senators moved to Arlington, and debuted as the Rangers the following spring.\n\nThe Rangers have made eight appearances in the MLB postseason, seven following division championships in 1996, 1998, 1999, 2010, 2011, 2015, and 2016 and as a [[Major League Baseball wild card|wild card]] team in 2012. In 2010, the Rangers advanced past the Division Series for the first time, defeating the [[Tampa Bay Rays]]. The team then brought home their [[2010 American League Championship Series|first American League pennant]] after beating the [[New York Yankees]] in six games. In the [[2010 World Series]], the franchise's first, the Rangers fell to the [[San Francisco Giants]] in five games. They repeated as American League champions the following year, then lost the [[2011 World Series]] to the [[St. Louis Cardinals]] in seven games.\n\n==History==\n{{main|History of the Texas Rangers (baseball)}}\n\n===Washington Senators (1961\u20131971)===\nWhen the  [[Washington Senators (1901\u201360)|Washington Senators]] moved to [[Minnesota]] in 1960 to become the [[Minnesota Twins|Twins]], Major League Baseball decided to expand a year earlier than planned to stave off the twin threats of competition from the proposed [[Continental League]] and loss of its [[Federal Baseball Club v. National League|exemption]] from the [[Sherman Antitrust Act]]. As part of the expansion, the American League added two new teams for the 1961 season\u2013the [[Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim|Los Angeles Angels]] and a new Washington Senators team. However, the new Senators were (and still are) considered an expansion team since the Twins retained the old Senators' records and history. The Senators and Angels began to fill their rosters with American League players in an [[1960 MLB Expansion Draft|expansion draft]]. The team played the {{MLBy|1961}} season at old [[Griffith Stadium]] before moving to the new [[District of Columbia Stadium]] under a 10-year lease.\n\n[[File:Richard Nixon throwing out opening pitch at Senators game, 1969.jpg|thumb|right|U.S. President [[Richard Nixon]] throwing [[Opening Day]] [[ceremonial first pitch]] at [[Robert F. Kennedy Memorial Stadium|RFK Stadium]] on April 7, 1969, with [[Ted Williams]] (left) and [[Bob Short]] (right, partially obscured by [[Ralph Houk]])]]\n\nFor most of their existence, the new Senators were the definition of futility, losing an average of 90 games a season. The team's struggles led to a twist on a joke about the old Senators: \"Washington: [[Henry Lee III#Political career|first in war, first in peace]] and ''still'' last in the American League.\" Their only winning season was in {{MLBy|1969}} when [[Baseball Hall of Fame|Hall of Famer]] [[Ted Williams]] managed the club to an 86\u201376 record, placing fourth in the AL East. [[Frank Howard (baseball)|Frank Howard]], an [[outfielder]]/[[first baseman]] from 1965 to 1972 known for his towering home runs, was the team's most accomplished player, winning two home run titles. The concurrent rise of the [[Baltimore Orioles]] to regular championship contenders (winning their first World Series in {{wsy|1966}}) did not help the Senators' cause either.\n\nOwnership changed hands several times during the franchise's stay in Washington and was often plagued by poor decision-making and planning. Following their brief success in 1969, owner [[Bob Short]] was forced to make many questionable trades to lower the debt he had incurred to pay for the team. By the end of the {{MLBy|1970}} campaign, Short had issued an ultimatum: unless someone was willing to buy the Senators for $12 million (by comparison, the [[New York Yankees]] were sold in 1973 for $8.8 million), he would not renew the stadium lease and would move the team elsewhere.\n\nShort was especially receptive to an offer brought up by [[Arlington, Texas]], mayor [[Tom Vandergriff]], who had been trying to obtain a major league sports team to play in the Metroplex for over a decade. Years earlier, [[Charles O. Finley]], the owner of the [[Kansas City Athletics]], sought to relocate his baseball team to Dallas, but the idea was rebuffed and ultimately declined by the other AL team owners. Arlington's [[hole card]] was [[Turnpike Stadium]], a 10,000-seat park which had been built in {{MLBy|1965}} to house the [[Double-A (baseball)|Double-A]] [[Dallas-Fort Worth Spurs]] of the [[Texas League]]. However, it had been built to MLB specifications, and only minor excavations would be necessary to expand the park to accommodate major league crowds.\n\nVandergriff's offer of a multimillion-dollar down payment prompted Short to make the move to Arlington. On September 21, 1971, by a vote of 10 to 2, American League owners granted approval to move the franchise to Arlington for the {{MLBy|1972}} season.<ref>{{cite news|last=Minot, Jr.|first=George|title=Short Takes Senators to Texas|newspaper=The Washington Post|date=September 22, 1971}}</ref> Senators fans were livid. Enmity came to a head at the club's last game in Washington. Thousands of fans simply walked in without paying after the security guards left early, swelling the paid attendance of 14,460 to around 25,000, while fans unfurled a banner reading \"SHORT STINKS\". With the Senators leading 7\u20135 and two outs in the top of the ninth inning, several hundred youths stormed the field, raiding it for souvenirs. One man grabbed [[first base]] and ran off with it. With no security in sight and only three bases, [[umpire (baseball)|umpire]] crew chief [[Jim Honochick]] forfeited the game to the New York Yankees.<ref name=\"sensforfeit\">{{cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/sports/redskins/history/rfk/articles/baseball.htm|last=McPherson|first=Myra |last2=Huth|first2=Tom|title=Rowdy Fans Hand Senators Final Loss|newspaper=The Washington Post|date=October 1, 1971}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|last2=Shannon|first2=Bill|last=Kalinsky|first=George|title=The Ballparks|location=New York|publisher=Hawthorn Books, Inc|year=1975|authorlink=George Kalinsky}}</ref> The nation's capital went without Major League Baseball for 33&nbsp;years until the relocation of the [[National League]]'s [[Montreal Expos]] who became the [[Washington Nationals]].\n\n===Texas Rangers (1972\u2013present)===\n\n====First years in Texas (1972\u20131984)====\n[[File:FrankLucchesiFlickr.jpg|thumb|left|[[Frank Lucchesi]], Rangers manager from 1975 to 1977]]\n\nPrior to the [[1972 Major League Baseball season|1972 season]], improvements were made to Turnpike Stadium, which reopened as [[Arlington Stadium]], in preparation for the inaugural season of the Texas Rangers. The team played its first game on April 15, 1972, a 1\u20130 loss at the hands of the [[California Angels]], their 1961 expansion cousins. The next day, the Rangers defeated the Angels, 5\u20131, for the club's first victory.\n\nIn 1974, the Rangers experienced their first winning season after finishing last in both 1972 and 1973. Under the ownership of [[Brad Corbett]], they finished second in the American League West with an 84\u201376 record, behind the eventual [[World Series]] champion [[Oakland Athletics]]. The [[1974 Texas Rangers season|1974 Rangers]] are still the only MLB team to finish above .500 after two consecutive 100-loss seasons. [[Mike Hargrove]] was awarded [[American League Rookie of the Year]], [[Billy Martin]] was named [[AL Manager of the Year]], [[Jeff Burroughs]] won [[AL MVP]], and [[Ferguson Jenkins]] was named the [[Sporting News Comeback Player of the Year Award|Comeback Player of the Year]] after winning 25 games, a club record to this day. The team posted winning records again from 1977 to 1979 but fell short of reaching the playoffs. The Rangers came very close to clinching a playoff spot in 1981, but wound up losing the first half of the AL West by one-and-a-half games to Oakland at the time of the [[1981 Major League Baseball strike|players' strike]]. Texas went on to finish under .500 each season through 1985.\n\nThe Rangers faced an attendance problem for a few years in Texas, due in part to both the team's inconsistent performance and the oppressive heat and humidity that can encompass the area in the summer. Until the [[Florida Marlins]] arrived in 1993, Arlington Stadium was often the hottest stadium in the majors, with temperatures frequently topping {{convert|100|F-change|0}} throughout the summer. So, the Rangers began playing most of their weekend games between May and September at night, a tradition that continues to this day.\n\n====Valentine, Ryan, and Bush (1985\u20131994)====\n[[File:Nolan Ryan Tiger Stadium 1990 CROP.jpg|thumb|right|[[Nolan Ryan]] pitched for the Rangers from 1989 to 1993.]]\n\nManager [[Bobby Valentine]] became steward over an influx of talent in the late 1980s and early 1990s. A winning season in 1986 was a shock to pundits and fans alike as the Rangers remained in the race for the American League pennant for the entire season. With a team consisting of stellar young rookies such as [[Rub\u00e9n Sierra]], [[Pete Incaviglia]], [[Mitch Williams (baseball)|Mitch Williams]], [[Bobby Witt]], and [[Edwin Correa]], the Rangers finished the season in second place with an 87\u201375 record, just five games behind the division-champion Angels. The season marked a dramatic 25-win improvement over the 1985 season, which resulted in yet another last-place finish in the West. The signing of 41-year-old star pitcher [[Nolan Ryan]] prior to the 1989 season allowed Ryan to reach his 5,000th [[strikeout]], 300th [[Win (baseball)|win]], and 6th and 7th [[no-hitter]]s with the Rangers. Despite powerful lineups including the likes of [[Juan Gonz\u00e1lez (baseball)|Juan Gonz\u00e1lez]], Rub\u00e9n Sierra, [[Julio Franco]], and [[Rafael Palmeiro]] and a pitching staff that also included [[Charlie Hough]], Bobby Witt, [[Kevin Brown (right-handed pitcher)|Kevin Brown]], and [[Kenny Rogers (baseball)|Kenny Rogers]], Valentine's Rangers never finished above second place and he was relieved of his duties during the 1992 season.\n\nIn April 1989, Rangers owner and oil tycoon [[Eddie Chiles]], sold the team to an investment group headed by [[George W. Bush]] for $89 million.<ref>[http://articles.latimes.com/1988-08-27/sports/sp-855_1_purchase-agreement Los Angeles Times: \"Chiles Reaches Agreement on Sale of Rangers\"] August 27, 1988</ref> While his own equity in the team was a small one ($500,000), Bush was named Managing General Partner of the new ownership group. He increased his investment to $600,000 the following year.<ref>[http://static.espn.go.com/mlb/bush/timeline.html ESPN: \"A series of beneficial moves\" By Tom Farrey] November 1, 1999</ref> Bush left his position with the Rangers when he was elected [[Governor of Texas]] in 1994, and he sold his stake in the team in 1998. Bush went on to be elected [[President of the United States]] in [[2000 United States presidential election|2000]].\n\nDuring Bush's tenure, the Rangers and the City of Arlington decided to replace the aging Arlington Stadium with a new publicly funded stadium, at a cost of $193 million, financed by Arlington residents, through a sales tax increase. Ground was broken on October 30, 1991, on what would become The Ballpark in Arlington (now named [[Globe Life Park in Arlington]]).\n\nIn 1993, [[Kevin Kennedy (baseball)|Kevin Kennedy]] took over managerial duties, presiding over the team for two seasons, keeping the 1993 Rangers in the hunt for a playoff berth into mid-September; Nolan Ryan also retired after that season. Kennedy was let go in 1994, although the team led the AL West prior to the [[1994\u201395 Major League Baseball strike|players' strike]] which prompted commissioner [[Bud Selig]] to cancel the remainder of the season and the playoffs. On July 28, Kenny Rogers pitched the 12th [[Perfect game (baseball)|perfect game]] in major league history in Arlington against the California Angels.\n\n====First division titles (1995\u20132000)====\n[[File:Rangersballparkinarlington.jpg|thumb|left|[[Globe Life Park]]  opened in 1994.]]\n\n[[Johnny Oates]] was hired as the Rangers' manager in 1995. Oates and company helped to bring home the 1996 AL Western Division Championship, the first division championship in franchise history. The first playoff series, 24 years after the franchise came to Texas, saw the Rangers lose to the New York Yankees, 3 games to 1. Oates was named AL Manager of the Year and [[Juan Gonz\u00e1lez (baseball)|Juan Gonz\u00e1lez]] was named AL MVP. The team featured a powerful lineup of hitters including Gonz\u00e1lez, [[Iv\u00e1n Rodr\u00edguez]], and [[Rusty Greer]], but continued to struggle with pitching despite having [[Rick Helling]] and [[Aaron Sele]] on their roster. Oates led the team to consecutive AL West championships in 1998 and 1999. Neither of Oates' last two playoff teams could win a single game, losing all six in back-to-back sweeps at the hands of the Yankees, a team that won three World Series in the 1990s after defeating Rangers teams in the first round. The 1999 team was to be the last playoff-bound team until 2010. En route to a second-straight last-place finish, Oates resigned his position 28&nbsp;games into the 2001 season.\n\nIn 1998, venture capital billionaire [[Tom Hicks]] bought the team for $250 million.<ref name=test>[http://static.espn.go.com/mlb/bush/timeline.html George W. Bush and the Texas Rangers], Espn.com. Retrieved on 2009-03-04.</ref>\n\n====The lean years (2001\u20132004)====\n[[File:Michael Young on April 25, 2009.jpg|thumb|right|[[Michael Young (baseball)|Michael Young]] was selected for the [[Major League Baseball All-Star Game|MLB All-Star Game]] seven times (2004\u20132009, 2011).]]\n\nPrior to the 2001 season, star free agent shortstop [[Alex Rodriguez]] was signed by the Rangers in the most lucrative deal in baseball history: a 10-year, $252 million contract. The move was controversial and is frequently maligned by fans and writers who thought that owner Tom Hicks was placing too much emphasis on one player instead of utilizing team resources to acquire several players, especially for a team that lacked pitching talent. Club officials maintained that Rodriguez would be the cornerstone of future postseason success. Although Rodriguez's individual performance was outstanding, the Rangers continued to struggle, and manager [[Jerry Narron]] was fired following the 2002 season and was replaced by seasoned manager [[Buck Showalter]]. The 2003 season signified the Rangers' fourth-straight last-place finish, and after a postseason fallout between Rodriguez and club management, the reigning AL MVP and newly appointed Rangers captain was traded to the New York Yankees for second baseman [[Alfonso Soriano]] and infield prospect [[Joaqu\u00edn \u00c1rias (baseball)|Joaquin Arias]].\n\nThe Rangers battled with the [[Anaheim Angels]] and Oakland Athletics for first place in the AL West for much of the 2004 season. [[Mark Teixeira]], Alfonso Soriano, [[Michael Young (baseball)|Michael Young]], and [[Hank Blalock]] became some of the best-hitting infielders in the league, with Young, Blalock, and Soriano being selected for the [[2004 Major League Baseball All-Star Game|2004 All-Star Game]]. Soriano was named the All-Star MVP after going 2 for 3 with a three-run [[home run]]. Despite a late-season push, the Rangers ended up losing six of their final ten games and finished in third place behind the Angels and A's, a mere three games out of first place.\n\n====Making changes (2005\u20132009)====\n[[File:Nelson Cruz.jpg|thumb|left|[[Nelson Cruz]], Rangers outfielder from 2006 to 2013]]\n\nIn 2005, the Rangers again struggled to find consistency amid controversy and injuries. [[John Hart (baseball)|John Hart]] stepped down as general manager following the 2005 season. [[Jon Daniels]] was promoted from assistant general manager to replace him. Daniels, at 28 years and one month, became the youngest general manager in major league history.\n\nDaniels and the Rangers front office were very active in acquiring new players before and during the 2006 season. New acquisitions included [[Brad Wilkerson]], [[Adam Eaton (pitcher)|Adam Eaton]], [[Kevin Millwood]], [[Carlos Lee]], and [[Nelson Cruz]]. Despite bolstering their roster, the Rangers' 2006 season ended with a disappointing 80\u201382 record and a third-place finish in the AL West. Buck Showalter was dismissed as manager after the season. The team hired Oakland third base coach [[Ron Washington]] as their next manager.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://texas.rangers.mlb.com/NASApp/mlb/news/article.jsp?ymd=20061105&content_id=1733731|title=Rangers select Washington to manage|first=T.R.|last=Sullivan|publisher=MLB.com|date=2006-11-06|accessdate=2006-05-30}}</ref> A change at manager was the first of several moves to strengthen the team in yet another busy offseason.

A number of roster moves before the 2007 trade deadline were the beginnings of a rebuilding project headed by Jon Daniels with a focus on the acquisition and development of young players. In the coming years, more club resources would be dedicated to improving the quality of the farm system and scouting departments, most notably in Latin America and the Far East. Daniels' objective was to field a legitimately competitive team by the 2010 season.\n\nThe Rangers began the 2008 season exceptionally well, headlined by newcomer [[Josh Hamilton]] who looked to be a threat to win the [[Major League Baseball Triple Crown|Triple Crown]], before fading off as the season wore on. During the All-Star festivities at [[Yankee Stadium (1923)|Yankee Stadium]], Hamilton crushed a first round home run record in the 2008 [[Home Run Derby]] with 28. Hamilton hit another four in the second round and three during the final round, for a total of 35 home runs, but lost to the Twins' [[Justin Morneau]]. Four Rangers played in the All Star Game: Hamilton, [[Ian Kinsler]], [[Milton Bradley (baseball)|Milton Bradley]], and Michael Young, who would repeat his 2006 All-Star Game feat by driving in the winning run via a sac fly.\n\nThe Rangers finished the season with yet another sub-.500 record (79\u201383), yet ended the season second in the AL West, the club's best finish since 1999. The 2009 season saw the Rangers soar into playoff contention for the first time since 2004.

He has multiple uniforms to match each of the variants the team wears. Captain's outfits sometimes match a theme the team is promoting; on April 24, 2010, he was dressed up like [[Elvis Presley]] as part of an Elvis themed night.\n\n==Roster==\n{{For|a complete list of all-time Rangers players|Texas Rangers all-time roster}}\n{{Texas Rangers roster}}\n\n==Achievements==\n===Baseball Hall of Famers===\n{{Main|National Baseball Hall of Fame and Museum}}\n{{Baseball hall of fame list\n|Current Team Name = Texas Rangers\n|   All Team Names = Rangers or Senators\n|          ColorA# = 003278\n|          ColorB# = FFFFFF\n|          ColorC# = C0111F\n|          ColorD# = FFFFFF\n|      Team Name 1 = '''Washington Senators'''\n|         List 1.1 =\n|         List 1.2 = [[Nellie Fox]]\n|         List 1.3 =\n|         List 1.4 = [[Ted Williams]]\n|         List 1.5 =\n|      Team Name 2 = '''Texas Rangers'''\n|         List 2.1 = [[Harold Baines]]<br />[[Bert Blyleven]]\n|         List 2.2 = [[Goose Gossage]]<br />[[Vladimir Guerrero]]\n|         List 2.3 = [[Whitey Herzog]]<br />\n|         List 2.4 = [[Ferguson Jenkins]]<br />[[Gaylord Perry]]\n|         List 2.5 = '''[[Iv\u00e1n Rodr\u00edguez]]''' *<br />'''[[Nolan Ryan]]'''\n|        Footnote1 = * Texas Rangers listed as primary team according to the Hall of Fame\n|        Footnote2 =\n|        Footnote3 =\n|        Footnote4 =\n|}}\n\n[[Chuck Hinton]] and [[Frank Howard (baseball)|Frank Howard]], who played for the franchise in Washington (although Howard played for the Rangers in 1972), are listed on the Washington Hall of Stars display at [[Nationals Park]] in Washington.

They compete in [[Major League Baseball]] (MLB) as a member club of the [[American League]] (AL) [[American League West|West division]]. In 2020, they will move to the new [[Globe Life Field]] after having played at [[Globe Life Park in Arlington]] from 1994 to 2019. The team's name is borrowed from the famous [[Texas Ranger Division|law enforcement agency]] of the same name.\n\nThe franchise was established in 1961 as the '''Washington Senators''', an [[expansion team]] awarded to [[Washington, D.C.]], after the city's first AL ballclub, the [[History of the Washington Senators (1901\u201360)|second Washington Senators]], moved to [[Minnesota]] and became the [[Minnesota Twins|Twins]] (the [[Washington Senators (1891\u201399)|original Washington Senators]] played primarily in the [[National League]] during the 1890s). After the {{MLBy|1971}} season, the new Senators moved to Arlington, and debuted as the Rangers the following spring.\n\nThe Rangers have made eight appearances in the MLB postseason, seven following division championships in 1996, 1998, 1999, 2010, 2011, 2015, and 2016 and as a [[Major League Baseball wild card|wild card]] team in 2012. In 2010, the Rangers advanced past the Division Series for the first time, defeating the [[Tampa Bay Rays]]. The team then brought home their [[2010 American League Championship Series|first American League pennant]] after beating the [[New York Yankees]] in six games. In the [[2010 World Series]], the franchise's first, the Rangers fell to the [[San Francisco Giants]] in five games. They repeated as American League champions the following year, then lost the [[2011 World Series]] to the [[St. Louis Cardinals]] in seven games.\n\n==History==\n{{main|History of the Texas Rangers (baseball)}}\n\n===Washington Senators (1961\u20131971)===\nWhen the  [[Washington Senators (1901\u201360)|Washington Senators]] moved to [[Minnesota]] in 1960 to become the [[Minnesota Twins|Twins]], Major League Baseball decided to expand a year earlier than planned to stave off the twin threats of competition from the proposed [[Continental League]] and loss of its [[Federal Baseball Club v. National League|exemption]] from the [[Sherman Antitrust Act]]. As part of the expansion, the American League added two new teams for the 1961 season\u2013the [[Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim|Los Angeles Angels]] and a new Washington Senators team. However, the new Senators were (and still are) considered an expansion team since the Twins retained the old Senators' records and history. The Senators and Angels began to fill their rosters with American League players in an [[1960 MLB Expansion Draft|expansion draft]]. The team played the {{MLBy|1961}} season at old [[Griffith Stadium]] before moving to the new [[District of Columbia Stadium]] under a 10-year lease.\n\n[[File:Richard Nixon throwing out opening pitch at Senators game, 1969.jpg|thumb|right|U.S. President [[Richard Nixon]] throwing [[Opening Day]] [[ceremonial first pitch]] at [[Robert F. Kennedy Memorial Stadium|RFK Stadium]] on April 7, 1969, with [[Ted Williams]] (left) and [[Bob Short]] (right, partially obscured by [[Ralph Houk]])]]\n\nFor most of their existence, the new Senators were the definition of futility, losing an average of 90 games a season. The team's struggles led to a twist on a joke about the old Senators: \"Washington: [[Henry Lee III#Political career|first in war, first in peace]] and ''still'' last in the American League.\" Their only winning season was in {{MLBy|1969}} when [[Baseball Hall of Fame|Hall of Famer]] [[Ted Williams]] managed the club to an 86\u201376 record, placing fourth in the AL East. [[Frank Howard (baseball)|Frank Howard]], an [[outfielder]]/[[first baseman]] from 1965 to 1972 known for his towering home runs, was the team's most accomplished player, winning two home run titles. The concurrent rise of the [[Baltimore Orioles]] to regular championship contenders (winning their first World Series in {{wsy|1966}}) did not help the Senators' cause either.\n\nOwnership changed hands several times during the franchise's stay in Washington and was often plagued by poor decision-making and planning. Following their brief success in 1969, owner [[Bob Short]] was forced to make many questionable trades to lower the debt he had incurred to pay for the team. By the end of the {{MLBy|1970}} campaign, Short had issued an ultimatum: unless someone was willing to buy the Senators for $12 million (by comparison, the [[New York Yankees]] were sold in 1973 for $8.8 million), he would not renew the stadium lease and would move the team elsewhere.\n\nShort was especially receptive to an offer brought up by [[Arlington, Texas]], mayor [[Tom Vandergriff]], who had been trying to obtain a major league sports team to play in the Metroplex for over a decade. Years earlier, [[Charles O. Finley]], the owner of the [[Kansas City Athletics]], sought to relocate his baseball team to Dallas, but the idea was rebuffed and ultimately declined by the other AL team owners. Arlington's [[hole card]] was [[Turnpike Stadium]], a 10,000-seat park which had been built in {{MLBy|1965}} to house the [[Double-A (baseball)|Double-A]] [[Dallas-Fort Worth Spurs]] of the [[Texas League]]. However, it had been built to MLB specifications, and only minor excavations would be necessary to expand the park to accommodate major league crowds.\n\nVandergriff's offer of a multimillion-dollar down payment prompted Short to make the move to Arlington. On September 21, 1971, by a vote of 10 to 2, American League owners granted approval to move the franchise to Arlington for the {{MLBy|1972}} season.<ref>{{cite news|last=Minot, Jr.|first=George|title=Short Takes Senators to Texas|newspaper=The Washington Post|date=September 22, 1971}}</ref> Senators fans were livid. Enmity came to a head at the club's last game in Washington. Thousands of fans simply walked in without paying after the security guards left early, swelling the paid attendance of 14,460 to around 25,000, while fans unfurled a banner reading \"SHORT STINKS\". With the Senators leading 7\u20135 and two outs in the top of the ninth inning, several hundred youths stormed the field, raiding it for souvenirs. One man grabbed [[first base]] and ran off with it. With no security in sight and only three bases, [[umpire (baseball)|umpire]] crew chief [[Jim Honochick]] forfeited the game to the New York Yankees.<ref name=\"sensforfeit\">{{cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/sports/redskins/history/rfk/articles/baseball.htm|last=McPherson|first=Myra |last2=Huth|first2=Tom|title=Rowdy Fans Hand Senators Final Loss|newspaper=The Washington Post|date=October 1, 1971}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|last2=Shannon|first2=Bill|last=Kalinsky|first=George|title=The Ballparks|location=New York|publisher=Hawthorn Books, Inc|year=1975|authorlink=George Kalinsky}}</ref> The nation's capital went without Major League Baseball for 33&nbsp;years until the relocation of the [[National League]]'s [[Montreal Expos]] who became the [[Washington Nationals]].\n\n===Texas Rangers (1972\u2013present)===\n\n====First years in Texas (1972\u20131984)====\n[[File:FrankLucchesiFlickr.jpg|thumb|left|[[Frank Lucchesi]], Rangers manager from 1975 to 1977]]\n\nPrior to the [[1972 Major League Baseball season|1972 season]], improvements were made to Turnpike Stadium, which reopened as [[Arlington Stadium]], in preparation for the inaugural season of the Texas Rangers. The team played its first game on April 15, 1972, a 1\u20130 loss at the hands of the [[California Angels]], their 1961 expansion cousins. The next day, the Rangers defeated the Angels, 5\u20131, for the club's first victory.\n\nIn 1974, the Rangers experienced their first winning season after finishing last in both 1972 and 1973. Under the ownership of [[Brad Corbett]], they finished second in the American League West with an 84\u201376 record, behind the eventual [[World Series]] champion [[Oakland Athletics]]. The [[1974 Texas Rangers season|1974 Rangers]] are still the only MLB team to finish above .500 after two consecutive 100-loss seasons. [[Mike Hargrove]] was awarded [[American League Rookie of the Year]], [[Billy Martin]] was named [[AL Manager of the Year]], [[Jeff Burroughs]] won [[AL MVP]], and [[Ferguson Jenkins]] was named the [[Sporting News Comeback Player of the Year Award|Comeback Player of the Year]] after winning 25 games, a club record to this day. The team posted winning records again from 1977 to 1979 but fell short of reaching the playoffs. The Rangers came very close to clinching a playoff spot in 1981, but wound up losing the first half of the AL West by one-and-a-half games to Oakland at the time of the [[1981 Major League Baseball strike|players' strike]]. Texas went on to finish under .500 each season through 1985.\n\nThe Rangers faced an attendance problem for a few years in Texas, due in part to both the team's inconsistent performance and the oppressive heat and humidity that can encompass the area in the summer. Until the [[Florida Marlins]] arrived in 1993, Arlington Stadium was often the hottest stadium in the majors, with temperatures frequently topping {{convert|100|F-change|0}} throughout the summer. So, the Rangers began playing most of their weekend games between May and September at night, a tradition that continues to this day.\n\n====Valentine, Ryan, and Bush (1985\u20131994)====\n[[File:Nolan Ryan Tiger Stadium 1990 CROP.jpg|thumb|right|[[Nolan Ryan]] pitched for the Rangers from 1989 to 1993.]]\n\nManager [[Bobby Valentine]] became steward over an influx of talent in the late 1980s and early 1990s. A winning season in 1986 was a shock to pundits and fans alike as the Rangers remained in the race for the American League pennant for the entire season. With a team consisting of stellar young rookies such as [[Rub\u00e9n Sierra]], [[Pete Incaviglia]], [[Mitch Williams (baseball)|Mitch Williams]], [[Bobby Witt]], and [[Edwin Correa]], the Rangers finished the season in second place with an 87\u201375 record, just five games behind the division-champion Angels. The season marked a dramatic 25-win improvement over the 1985 season, which resulted in yet another last-place finish in the West. The signing of 41-year-old star pitcher [[Nolan Ryan]] prior to the 1989 season allowed Ryan to reach his 5,000th [[strikeout]], 300th [[Win (baseball)|win]], and 6th and 7th [[no-hitter]]s with the Rangers. Despite powerful lineups including the likes of [[Juan Gonz\u00e1lez (baseball)|Juan Gonz\u00e1lez]], Rub\u00e9n Sierra, [[Julio Franco]], and [[Rafael Palmeiro]] and a pitching staff that also included [[Charlie Hough]], Bobby Witt, [[Kevin Brown (right-handed pitcher)|Kevin Brown]], and [[Kenny Rogers (baseball)|Kenny Rogers]], Valentine's Rangers never finished above second place and he was relieved of his duties during the 1992 season.\n\nIn April 1989, Rangers owner and oil tycoon [[Eddie Chiles]], sold the team to an investment group headed by [[George W. Bush]] for $89 million.<ref>[http://articles.latimes.com/1988-08-27/sports/sp-855_1_purchase-agreement Los Angeles Times: \"Chiles Reaches Agreement on Sale of Rangers\"] August 27, 1988</ref> While his own equity in the team was a small one ($500,000), Bush was named Managing General Partner of the new ownership group. He increased his investment to $600,000 the following year.<ref>[http://static.espn.go.com/mlb/bush/timeline.html ESPN: \"A series of beneficial moves\" By Tom Farrey] November 1, 1999</ref> Bush left his position with the Rangers when he was elected [[Governor of Texas]] in 1994, and he sold his stake in the team in 1998. Bush went on to be elected [[President of the United States]] in [[2000 United States presidential election|2000]].\n\nDuring Bush's tenure, the Rangers and the City of Arlington decided to replace the aging Arlington Stadium with a new publicly funded stadium, at a cost of $193 million, financed by Arlington residents, through a sales tax increase. Ground was broken on October 30, 1991, on what would become The Ballpark in Arlington (now named [[Globe Life Park in Arlington]]).\n\nIn 1993, [[Kevin Kennedy (baseball)|Kevin Kennedy]] took over managerial duties, presiding over the team for two seasons, keeping the 1993 Rangers in the hunt for a playoff berth into mid-September; Nolan Ryan also retired after that season. Kennedy was let go in 1994, although the team led the AL West prior to the [[1994\u201395 Major League Baseball strike|players' strike]] which prompted commissioner [[Bud Selig]] to cancel the remainder of the season and the playoffs. On July 28, Kenny Rogers pitched the 12th [[Perfect game (baseball)|perfect game]] in major league history in Arlington against the California Angels.\n\n====First division titles (1995\u20132000)====\n[[File:Rangersballparkinarlington.jpg|thumb|left|[[Globe Life Park]]  opened in 1994.]]\n\n[[Johnny Oates]] was hired as the Rangers' manager in 1995. Oates and company helped to bring home the 1996 AL Western Division Championship, the first division championship in franchise history. The first playoff series, 24 years after the franchise came to Texas, saw the Rangers lose to the New York Yankees, 3 games to 1. Oates was named AL Manager of the Year and [[Juan Gonz\u00e1lez (baseball)|Juan Gonz\u00e1lez]] was named AL MVP. The team featured a powerful lineup of hitters including Gonz\u00e1lez, [[Iv\u00e1n Rodr\u00edguez]], and [[Rusty Greer]], but continued to struggle with pitching despite having [[Rick Helling]] and [[Aaron Sele]] on their roster. Oates led the team to consecutive AL West championships in 1998 and 1999. Neither of Oates' last two playoff teams could win a single game, losing all six in back-to-back sweeps at the hands of the Yankees, a team that won three World Series in the 1990s after defeating Rangers teams in the first round. The 1999 team was to be the last playoff-bound team until 2010. En route to a second-straight last-place finish, Oates resigned his position 28&nbsp;games into the 2001 season.\n\nIn 1998, venture capital billionaire [[Tom Hicks]] bought the team for $250 million.<ref name=test>[http://static.espn.go.com/mlb/bush/timeline.html George W. Bush and the Texas Rangers], Espn.com. Retrieved on 2009-03-04.</ref>\n\n====The lean years (2001\u20132004)====\n[[File:Michael Young on April 25, 2009.jpg|thumb|right|[[Michael Young (baseball)|Michael Young]] was selected for the [[Major League Baseball All-Star Game|MLB All-Star Game]] seven times (2004\u20132009, 2011).]]\n\nPrior to the 2001 season, star free agent shortstop [[Alex Rodriguez]] was signed by the Rangers in the most lucrative deal in baseball history: a 10-year, $252 million contract. The move was controversial and is frequently maligned by fans and writers who thought that owner Tom Hicks was placing too much emphasis on one player instead of utilizing team resources to acquire several players, especially for a team that lacked pitching talent. Club officials maintained that Rodriguez would be the cornerstone of future postseason success. Although Rodriguez's individual performance was outstanding, the Rangers continued to struggle, and manager [[Jerry Narron]] was fired following the 2002 season and was replaced by seasoned manager [[Buck Showalter]]. The 2003 season signified the Rangers' fourth-straight last-place finish, and after a postseason fallout between Rodriguez and club management, the reigning AL MVP and newly appointed Rangers captain was traded to the New York Yankees for second baseman [[Alfonso Soriano]] and infield prospect [[Joaqu\u00edn \u00c1rias (baseball)|Joaquin Arias]].\n\nThe Rangers battled with the [[Anaheim Angels]] and Oakland Athletics for first place in the AL West for much of the 2004 season. [[Mark Teixeira]], Alfonso Soriano, [[Michael Young (baseball)|Michael Young]], and [[Hank Blalock]] became some of the best-hitting infielders in the league, with Young, Blalock, and Soriano being selected for the [[2004 Major League Baseball All-Star Game|2004 All-Star Game]]. Soriano was named the All-Star MVP after going 2 for 3 with a three-run [[home run]]. Despite a late-season push, the Rangers ended up losing six of their final ten games and finished in third place behind the Angels and A's, a mere three games out of first place.\n\n====Making changes (2005\u20132009)====\n[[File:Nelson Cruz.jpg|thumb|left|[[Nelson Cruz]], Rangers outfielder from 2006 to 2013]]\n\nIn 2005, the Rangers again struggled to find consistency amid controversy and injuries. [[John Hart (baseball)|John Hart]] stepped down as general manager following the 2005 season. [[Jon Daniels]] was promoted from assistant general manager to replace him. Daniels, at 28 years and one month, became the youngest general manager in major league history.\n\nDaniels and the Rangers front office were very active in acquiring new players before and during the 2006 season. New acquisitions included [[Brad Wilkerson]], [[Adam Eaton (pitcher)|Adam Eaton]], [[Kevin Millwood]], [[Carlos Lee]], and [[Nelson Cruz]]. Despite bolstering their roster, the Rangers' 2006 season ended with a disappointing 80\u201382 record and a third-place finish in the AL West. Buck Showalter was dismissed as manager after the season. The team hired Oakland third base coach [[Ron Washington]] as their next manager.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://texas.rangers.mlb.com/NASApp/mlb/news/article.jsp?ymd=20061105&content_id=1733731|title=Rangers select Washington to manage|first=T.R.|last=Sullivan|publisher=MLB.com|date=2006-11-06|accessdate=2006-05-30}}</ref> A change at manager was the first of several moves to strengthen the team in yet another busy offseason.

A number of roster moves before the 2007 trade deadline were the beginnings of a rebuilding project headed by Jon Daniels with a focus on the acquisition and development of young players. In the coming years, more club resources would be dedicated to improving the quality of the farm system and scouting departments, most notably in Latin America and the Far East. Daniels' objective was to field a legitimately competitive team by the 2010 season.\n\nThe Rangers began the 2008 season exceptionally well, headlined by newcomer [[Josh Hamilton]] who looked to be a threat to win the [[Major League Baseball Triple Crown|Triple Crown]], before fading off as the season wore on. During the All-Star festivities at [[Yankee Stadium (1923)|Yankee Stadium]], Hamilton crushed a first round home run record in the 2008 [[Home Run Derby]] with 28. Hamilton hit another four in the second round and three during the final round, for a total of 35 home runs, but lost to the Twins' [[Justin Morneau]]. Four Rangers played in the All Star Game: Hamilton, [[Ian Kinsler]], [[Milton Bradley (baseball)|Milton Bradley]], and Michael Young, who would repeat his 2006 All-Star Game feat by driving in the winning run via a sac fly.\n\nThe Rangers finished the season with yet another sub-.500 record (79\u201383), yet ended the season second in the AL West, the club's best finish since 1999. The 2009 season saw the Rangers soar into playoff contention for the first time since 2004. Despite injuries to Josh Hamilton and [[Ian Kinsler]], the Rangers held first place in their division for long stretches of the summer before fading after September 1, losing the division to the Los Angeles Angels. The Rangers finished the season at 87\u201375, their first winning season since 2004 and good enough for second place in the AL West. Michael Young responded to his move to third base by posting one of his best offensive seasons ever while committing just nine errors and earning a sixth-straight All-Star appearance.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://sports.espn.go.com/mlb/players/stats?playerId=4566 |title=Michael Young Stats \u2013 Texas Rangers \u2013 ESPN |publisher=Sports.espn.go.com |date=1976-10-19 |accessdate=2013-08-29}}</ref> Josh Hamilton and [[Nelson Cruz]] were also named 2009 AL All-Stars.\n\n====Rangers Baseball Express, LLC====\nFollowing financial problems, including defaulting on a $525 million loan,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.finalternatives.com/node/7478 |title=Tom Hicks' Sports Group Defaults On $525 Million In Loans |publisher=FINalternatives |date=2009-04-03 |accessdate=2013-08-29}}</ref> [[Tom Hicks]] and Hicks Sports Group reached an agreement to sell the Texas Rangers to group headed by Pittsburgh sports lawyer [[Chuck Greenberg (businessman)|Chuck Greenberg]] and Rangers team president Nolan Ryan for approximately $570 million on January 22, 2010.<ref name=\"mlb.mlb.com\">[http://mlb.mlb.com/news/article.jsp?ymd=20100122&content_id=7958194&vkey=news_tex&fext=.jsp&c_id=tex&partnerId=rss_tex Hicks' sale of Rangers finalized] ''MLB.com''</ref> Hicks also sold much of the land surrounding Rangers Ballpark to Greenberg and Ryan's group in a separate deal.\n\nHowever, one of HSG's principal lenders, [[Monarch Alternative Capital]], opposed the sale on grounds that the proceeds would not fully repay the defaulted HSG notes.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://bizofbaseball.com/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=4309:brown-time-for-mlb-to-play-hardball-on-the-texas-rangers-sale&catid=26:editorials&Itemid=39 |title=Brown: Time for MLB to Play Hardball on the Texas Rangers Sale |publisher=Bizofbaseball.com |date=2010-04-22 |accessdate=2013-08-29}}</ref> On April 21, Major League Baseball issued a statement declaring the Rangers' sale to be under the control of the Commissioner to expedite the process.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://rangersblog.dallasnews.com/archives/2010/04/mlb-statement-on-rangers-sale.html |title=MLB statement on Rangers sale : Texas Rangers Blog &#124; |work=The Dallas Morning News |publisher=Rangersblog.dallasnews.com |date=2010-04-21 |accessdate=2013-08-29}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|author=Fort Worth Star-Telegram |url=http://startelegramsports.typepad.com/foul_territory/2010/04/mlb-says-its-in-control-of-sale.html |title=Foul Territory: MLB says it's in control of sale |publisher=Startelegramsports.typepad.com |date=2010-04-21 |accessdate=2013-08-29}}</ref> As the stalemate between HSG and its creditors continued, the Texas Rangers filed for [[Chapter 11, Title 11, United States Code|Chapter 11 bankruptcy]] on May 24.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.nydailynews.com/sports/baseball/yankees/2010/05/24/2010-05-24_arod_takes_a_hit_texas_rangers_file_for_bankrupcty_could_cost_yankees_alex_rodri.html | location=New York | work=Daily News | title=A-Rod takes a hit: Texas Rangers file for bankruptcy, could cost Yankees' Alex Rodriguez $25 million | first1=Bill | last1=Madden | first2=Corky | last2=Siemaszko | date=May 24, 2010}}</ref><ref name=\"blogs.wsj.com\">{{cite news| url=https://blogs.wsj.com/bankruptcy/2010/05/24/texas-rangers-owe-alex-rodriguez-249-million/ | work=The Wall Street Journal | title=Texas Rangers Owe Alex Rodriguez $24.9 Million | first=Eric | last=Morath | date=May 24, 2010}}</ref> As of that date, the Rangers and HSG had an estimated debt of $575 million.<ref name=\"blogs.wsj.com\"/> Much of the unsecured debt was owed in back salary.

Between them, \"[[House of Love (RuPaul song)|House of Love]]\" was released without a video. It failed to place on any U.S. charts, despite rising to 68 on the [[UK Singles Chart]].\n\nRuPaul was signed to a modeling contract for [[Make-up Art Cosmetics|MAC Cosmetics]]. Various billboards featured him in full drag, often with the text \"I am the MAC girl\". He also released his [[autobiography]], ''[[Lettin' It All Hang Out]]''. He promoted the book in part with a 1995 guest appearance on [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]]'s ''[[All My Children]]'', in a storyline that put it on the set of [[Erica Kane]]'s talk show \"The Cutting Edge\".\n\nThe next year he landed a talk show of his own on [[VH1]], called ''[[The RuPaul Show]]'', interviewing [[celebrity]] guests and musical acts. [[Diana Ross]], [[Nirvana (band)|Nirvana]], [[Duran Duran]], [[Pat Benatar]], [[Mary J. Blige]], [[Bea Arthur]], [[Dionne Warwick]], [[Cyndi Lauper]], [[Olivia Newton-John]], [[Beenie Man]], [[Pete Burns]], [[Bow Wow Wow]], and the [[Backstreet Boys]] were notable guests. His co-host was [[Michelle Visage]], with whom he also co-hosted on [[WKTU]] radio. On one episode, RuPaul featured guests [[Chi Chi LaRue]] and [[Tom Chase]] speaking about the [[gay]] [[pornography|porn]] industry.\n\nLater in the year he released his second album, ''[[Foxy Lady (RuPaul album)|Foxy Lady]]'', this time on the L.A.-based [[Rhino Records]] label. Despite his growing celebrity, he failed to chart on the ''Billboard'' 200. However, the first single \"[[Snapshot (song)|Snapshot]]\" found success in the dance market and went to number four on the [[Hot Dance Club Songs|Hot Dance Music/Club Play]] chart. It also enjoyed limited mainstream success, charting at 95 on the ''Billboard'' Hot 100, which was his second and only other Hot 100 entry to date (1996?). The second single \"[[A Little Bit of Love (RuPaul song)|A Little Bit of Love]]\" only charted at 28 on the Hot Dance Music/Club Play chart. The album featured covers of a 1981 [[Diana Ross]] song \"Work That Body\", co-written by [[Paul Jabara]] and \"[[If You Were a Woman (And I Was a Man)|If You Were a Woman and I Was a Man]]\", originally recorded by [[Bonnie Tyler]]. Because of his strong fan base within the [[gay community]], RuPaul has performed at [[gay pride]] events and numerous [[gay club]]s. During this time RuPaul helped launch the return of WKTU radio in [[New York City]] and would serve as host of the morning show until 1998.\n\nIn 1997, he released his third album, a [[Christmas]] album entitled ''[[Ho Ho Ho (album)|Ho Ho Ho]]''. He has had guest appearances in many films, including both [[The Brady Bunch Movie|''Brady Bunch'' movies]], in which he played Jan's female guidance counselor. In 1997 RuPaul teamed with [[Martha Wash]] to remake the classic disco anthem, \"[[It's Raining Men]]\". The song was included on the 1998 compilation CD ''[[Rupaul's Go-Go Box Classics|RuPaul's Go Go Box Classics]]'', which was a collection of some of his favorite dance songs by other artists; this would be his third and final release through [[Rhino Records]] and a major record label. It was during this time that he appeared in [[Webex]] TV commercials and magazine ads. In 2002 he recorded with [[Brigitte Nielsen]], credited as Gitta, the [[Eurodance]] track \"You're No Lady\".\n\n===2004\u20132007: ''Red Hot'', ''ReWorked'', and ''Starrbooty''===\n[[File:RuPaul by David Shankbone.jpg|thumb|RuPaul in 2007]]\nIn 2004, RuPaul released his fourth album, ''[[Red Hot (album)|Red Hot]]'' on his own RuCo Inc. music label. It received some dance radio and club play, but very little press coverage. On his [[blog]], RuPaul discussed how he felt betrayed by the entertainment industry, particularly the [[gay press]]. In one incident, it was noted that ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]'' refused to review the album, instead asking him to make a comedic contribution to a fashion article. He likened the experience to \"a black person being invited to a party, but only if they'll serve.\" Despite his apparent dissatisfaction with the release, ''Red Hot'' showed RuPaul returning to the top of the dance charts in the US with the lead off single \"[[Looking Good, Feeling Gorgeous]]\" hitting number two on the dance chart. The second, \"[[Workout (RuPaul song)|WorkOut]]\", peaked at number five. The third and final single from the album \"People Are People\" a duet with Tom Trujillo peaked at number 10. The album itself only charted on the [[Dance/Electronic Albums|Top Electronic Albums]] chart, where it hit number nine.<ref>{{cite magazine|url=http://www.billboard.com/charts/2004-10-16/dance-electronic-albums |title=Dance/Electronic Albums : Oct 16, 2004 &#124; Billboard Chart Archive |magazine=Billboard.com |accessdate=December 3, 2013}}</ref> When asked about this in an interview, RuPaul said, \"Well, betrayed might be the wrong word. 'Betrayed' alludes to an idea that there was some kind of a promise made to me, and there never was. More so, I was disappointed. I don't feel like it was a betrayal. Nobody promises anything in show business and you understand that from day one. But, I don't know what happened. It seemed I couldn't get press on my album unless I was willing to play into the role that the mainstream press has assigned to gay people, which is as servants of straight ideals.\"<ref name=DS>RuPaul in Shankbone, David.

Initially participating in [[gender bender]]-style performances, RuPaul performed solo and in collaboration with other bands at several [[New York City]] nightclubs, most notably the [[Pyramid Club (New York)|Pyramid Club]]. He played opposite New York City drag performer Mona Foote (Nashom Benjamin) in the one-act [[science-fiction]] parody \"My Pet Homo\" written and directed by Jon Michael Johnson for Cooper Square Productions. He appeared for many years at the annual [[Wigstock]] [[Drag (clothing)|drag]] festival and appeared in the [[documentary film|documentary]] ''[[Wigstock: The Movie]]''.

It was released through the rap label [[Tommy Boy Entertainment|Tommy Boy]], spawning the [[Dance music|dance track]] hit \"[[Supermodel (You Better Work)]]\". The [[music video]] was an unexpected success on MTV channels, as [[grunge]] and [[gangsta rap]] were popular at the time. The song peaked at 45 on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]]. It charted on the [[UK Singles Chart]], peaking on the top 40 at 39. The song found the most success on the ''Billboard'' [[Hot Dance Club Songs|Hot Dance Music/Club Play]] chart, where it peaked at 2.

Between them, \"[[House of Love (RuPaul song)|House of Love]]\" was released without a video. It failed to place on any U.S. charts, despite rising to 68 on the [[UK Singles Chart]].\n\nRuPaul was signed to a modeling contract for [[Make-up Art Cosmetics|MAC Cosmetics]]. Various billboards featured him in full drag, often with the text \"I am the MAC girl\". He also released his [[autobiography]], ''[[Lettin' It All Hang Out]]''. He promoted the book in part with a 1995 guest appearance on [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]]'s ''[[All My Children]]'', in a storyline that put it on the set of [[Erica Kane]]'s talk show \"The Cutting Edge\".\n\nThe next year he landed a talk show of his own on [[VH1]], called ''[[The RuPaul Show]]'', interviewing [[celebrity]] guests and musical acts.

His co-host was [[Michelle Visage]], with whom he also co-hosted on [[WKTU]] radio. On one episode, RuPaul featured guests [[Chi Chi LaRue]] and [[Tom Chase]] speaking about the [[gay]] [[pornography|porn]] industry.\n\nLater in the year he released his second album, ''[[Foxy Lady (RuPaul album)|Foxy Lady]]'', this time on the L.A.-based [[Rhino Records]] label. Despite his growing celebrity, he failed to chart on the ''Billboard'' 200. However, the first single \"[[Snapshot (song)|Snapshot]]\" found success in the dance market and went to number four on the [[Hot Dance Club Songs|Hot Dance Music/Club Play]] chart. It also enjoyed limited mainstream success, charting at 95 on the ''Billboard'' Hot 100, which was his second and only other Hot 100 entry to date (1996?). The second single \"[[A Little Bit of Love (RuPaul song)|A Little Bit of Love]]\" only charted at 28 on the Hot Dance Music/Club Play chart.

Because of his strong fan base within the [[gay community]], RuPaul has performed at [[gay pride]] events and numerous [[gay club]]s. During this time RuPaul helped launch the return of WKTU radio in [[New York City]] and would serve as host of the morning show until 1998.\n\nIn 1997, he released his third album, a [[Christmas]] album entitled ''[[Ho Ho Ho (album)|Ho Ho Ho]]''.

The song was included on the 1998 compilation CD ''[[Rupaul's Go-Go Box Classics|RuPaul's Go Go Box Classics]]'', which was a collection of some of his favorite dance songs by other artists; this would be his third and final release through [[Rhino Records]] and a major record label.

It received some dance radio and club play, but very little press coverage. On his [[blog]], RuPaul discussed how he felt betrayed by the entertainment industry, particularly the [[gay press]]. In one incident, it was noted that ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]'' refused to review the album, instead asking him to make a comedic contribution to a fashion article. He likened the experience to \"a black person being invited to a party, but only if they'll serve.\" Despite his apparent dissatisfaction with the release, ''Red Hot'' showed RuPaul returning to the top of the dance charts in the US with the lead off single \"[[Looking Good, Feeling Gorgeous]]\" hitting number two on the dance chart. The second, \"[[Workout (RuPaul song)|WorkOut]]\", peaked at number five. The third and final single from the album \"People Are People\" a duet with Tom Trujillo peaked at number 10.

'Betrayed' alludes to an idea that there was some kind of a promise made to me, and there never was. More so, I was disappointed. I don't feel like it was a betrayal. Nobody promises anything in show business and you understand that from day one. But, I don't know what happened. It seemed I couldn't get press on my album unless I was willing to play into the role that the mainstream press has assigned to gay people, which is as servants of straight ideals.\"<ref name=DS>RuPaul in Shankbone, David.
