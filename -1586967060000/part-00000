As soon as the remote infrared detects pedestrians or larger animals on course for collision in the dark, the system directs two separately controlled Dynamic Light Spots at them without creating an unpleasant glare.

Administratively, Aars is the municipal seat of [[Vesthimmerland Municipality]] and biggest town of [[Vesthimmerland Municipality]], [[Region Nordjylland]] since 2007 and it was also the seat of the mayor in the now abolished [[Aars Municipality]]. The town was founded in the 14th century. It is one of the four principal towns  of Vesthimmerland, the other ones being [[Fars\u00f8]], [[L\u00f8gst\u00f8r]] and [[Aalestrup]]. Aars is a former [[railway town]]. It is currently the 76 largest city in Denmark just behind [[Ribe]] but in front of [[Helsinge]]. It is the 9th biggest town/city in [[Region Nordjylland]] in front of [[Skagen]] but behind [[S\u00e6by]].

The site name researcher Svend Aakj\u00e6r's statement was that it originates from the [[Old Norse]] / Old English word \u00e1rr or \u00e1rmadr (Ar in old English). Which in Danish means the king's ombudsman or [[earl]]. Another explanation is that it comes from the man name Aar / Ar.<ref>{{cite book|title=Nudansk Ordbog|date=1989|publisher=Politikens Forlag}}</ref>\n\n===Aars stone===\n[[File:\u00c5rs2 600px.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Aars stone]]\nAt the church in Aars there is a [[rune stone]] with the following inscription: (front) Asser put this stone after his lord Valtoke, (backside) The stone proclaims that it will stand here for a long time, it should mention Valtoke's varie. Valtoke full name was [[Valtoke Gormsson]] but he was also called [[Toke Gormsson]], and he was son of [[Gorm the old]] (Danish: Gorm den gamle).

From 1660, it was a part of Aalborghus Amt, but from 1970 to 2007, it was a part of [[Aalborg]] Amt until [[Aalborg]] Amt melted together with [[Hj\u00f8rring]] Amt and created Nordjyllands Amt (English: [[North Jutland County|North Jutland amt]]).<ref>{{cite web|title=Amt-herred-sogn siderne|url=https://www.slaegtogdata.dk/kilder/amt-herred-sogn}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=\u00c5rs Herred|url=https://da.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C3%85rs_Herred|website=da.wikipedia}}{{Circular reference|date=May 2017}}</ref>\n\n=== Railway town ===\n[[File:AalestrupL\u00f8gst\u00f8r28Baneg\u00e5rdsvej.JPG|thumb|The decommissioned railway has now been repurposed as the pathway ''Himmerlandsstien'']]\nIn 1875, there were 782 residents in [[Aars parish]]. In a description from around that time of the city is said \"Aars with Church, Priestegaard, School and Inn with Grocery Store, Bakery and Meltyard\". In 1880 there was another grocery store. The end of the 18th century was there a post office.\n\nIn 1893, the city received a state railway station on the Himmerlandsbaner from [[Hobro]] / [[Viborg, Denmark|Viborg]] via [[Aalestrup]] to [[L\u00f8gst\u00f8r]]. In 1899, Aars became [[Himmerland]]'s railroad junction. The private railway Aars-[[Nibe]]-[[Svenstrup, Aalborg Municipality|Svenstrup]] (-Aalborg) got a terminal here and was extended in 1910 from Aars to [[Hvalpsund (city)|Hvalpsund]]. The Great Rail Act of 1918 even opened the possibility that there should also be a Himmelland crossroads Aars-Arden-B\u00e6lum-\u00d8ster Hurup, but this course was never brought, like most projects in this law.\n\n[[Aalborg]]-[[Hvalpsund (city)|Hvalpsund]] Railway was closed in 1969. As early as 1966, DSB's passenger traffic at Aars Station was terminated. The freight traffic Viborg-L\u00f8gst\u00f8r continued with the expedition station in Aars, but ended in 1999. The station has been demolished, the track was taken up in 2006 and the former railway station is now shopstores. It will be used by the Himmerlands path to [[Viborg, Denmark|Viborg]] and [[L\u00f8gst\u00f8r]]. Nature trail [[Nibe]]-[[Hvalpsund (city)|Hvalpsund]] uses the railway line to Nibe, but follows L\u00f8gst\u00f8rvej in the first 2&nbsp;km towards [[Havbro]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Himmerlandsbanerne|url=http://www.baner-omkring-aalborg.dk/?Himmerlandsbanerne|website=Nordjyllands jernbaner}}</ref>\n\n{{clear left}}\n\n===Aars Municipality===\n{{main|Aars Municipality}}\n[[Aars Municipality]] was formed by Kommunalreformen in 1970 which made the Parishes into municipalities and in the Aars municipality the town of Aars was the head city/capital/municipal seat of the municipality. The municipality covered an area of 223&nbsp;km\u00b2 and had a total population of 13,284 in 2005. But in 2007, Aars Municipality ceased to exist and was merged with the former [[Fars\u00f8]], [[L\u00f8gst\u00f8r]], and [[Aalestrup]] municipalities to form the new [[Vesthimmerland Municipality]], with an area of 768.08&nbsp;km\u00b2 (2013)<ref>{{cite web|title=noegletal.dk|url=http://www.noegletal.dk/}}</ref> and a total population of 38,277 (2008). The reason behind the merge was [[Municipalities of Denmark#Municipal Reform 2007|''Kommunalreformen'' (\"The Municipal Reform\" of 2007)]] which merged many of the now former municipalities into bigger municipalities. Aars Municipality also had what is called a Municipality shield which was a Cimbrian bull (Danish:cimbrertyren) with a red background. The bull symbolized that the [[Cimbri]] were present in what was the area in Aars Municipality. Even though Aars Municipality is a thing of the past, the municipality shield can still be found around the city, for example in manhole covers and in the city entrance sign.\n\n===Excavation===\nThe construction of a new bypass revealed 4000 year-old buildings. The archaeologists from [[Vesthimmerland Museum]] in Aars found a collection of houses they estimated to be around 4000 years old. However, there are only staggered tracks and other tracks, but overall, the findings show that the Aars area has been populated, and probably also densely populated for several thousands of years.\n\nThey have found traces of more houses. They assume that at least five of the houses are simultaneous. There is a trace of the [[plow]] type called an ard. Other things have also been found at the old houses. There have been found remains of an [[amber]], ceramic cut, Flintafslags and two [[axe]]s, a mountain axe and a single-grave axe.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Hansen|first1=Torsten|title=4000 \u00e5r gamle bygninger kom frem i lyset|url=http://www.aars.dk/nyheder/4000-aar-gamle-bygninger-kom-frem-i-lyset-3511|website=Aars.dk}}</ref>\n\n== Buildings ==\n[[File:Aars Kirke2.JPG|thumb|Aars Church]]\n\n=== The church ===\n{{main|Aars Church}}\n[[Aars Church]] is a Lutheran church. It was the church of the medieval {{Interlanguage link|Aars parish|da|Aars Sogn|vertical-align=sup}}. The original Romanesque building was extensively remodeled and was transformed into a cruciform church of considerable size in 1921. The oldest part is from around 1200.

The museum was initiated in 1920 by [[Johannes V. Jensen]], and eventually built in 1935. In 1999 the native artist [[Per Kirkeby]] and architect [[Jens Bertelsen]] designed the new extension buildings and the museum has some of Per Kirkeby's artwork on display.\n\n===Water tower===\n{{main|Aars water tower}}\nThe tower is called Aars water tower since it is located in Aars city. The tower is built right in the middle of a very old water tank from where the city's original water supply went out. As it sounds, it was Aars's water tower. The building has many beautiful handicrafts. In the past, the tower used to have a neon logo on top showing the [[Cimbrian bull]] from Aars and [[Aars Municipality]] coat of arm/shield, but it was taken down. The tower was also a shop where you could buy yarn and many other things like tea cups. But the shop moved away from the tower.<ref>{{cite web|title=Aars Vandt\u00e5rn|url=http://www.aars.dk/aars-vandtaarn|website=Aars.dk}}</ref>\n\n===Aars Cinema===\nAars Cinema is the local [[Movie theater|cinema]] and the only one in Aars. It is a union-driven cinema, where the tasks are mainly performed by volunteers. The cinema is located in Aars hovedgade (English: Main street). The building has a man on the front of the building and other part of the building is painted with persons, some of the people painted are from ''[[Olsen-banden]]'' and it the 3 main characters Egon, Benny and Kjeld.

An [[EU]] grant of DKK 11.5 million became vacant, because the fiddle plug for the Aalborg House of Music ''[[Musikkens Hus]]'' project was waiting. In addition, the ALFA project received a grant of DKK 3.2 million from the [[EU]]. In 2008, Vesthimmerlands Musikhus ALFA (aka. Musikhuset) was finished, designed by architectural firm [[Kj\u00e6r & Richter]] in collaboration with Per Kirkeby.<ref>[http://vmalfa.dk/forside.aspx Vesthimmerlands Musikhus ALFA] {{in lang|da}}</ref>\n\nThe ALFA House of Music comprise a concert hall with room for 420 guests and several teaching facilities. ALFA is an acronym for [[Aalestrup]], [[L\u00f8gst\u00f8r]], [[Fars\u00f8]] and Aars, the four largest towns in the Vesthimmerland municipality, thus symbolizing the regional status of this cultural center.<ref>[http://vmalfa.dk/om-alfa.aspx Om ALFA] {{in lang|da}}</ref>\n\n==Education facilities==\n[[File:AarsSkoleMMadsensVej.jpg|thumb|Aars School]]\n\n===Aars School===\nAars skole or Aars school is one of two city schools located in Aars city.

Administratively, Aars is the municipal seat of [[Vesthimmerland municipality]] and biggest town of [[Vesthimmerland municipality]], [[Region Nordjylland]] since 2007 and it was also the seat of the mayor in the now abolished [[Aars Municipality]]. The town was founded in the 14th century. It is one of the four principal towns  of Vesthimmerland, the other ones being [[Fars\u00f8]], [[L\u00f8gst\u00f8r]] and [[Aalestrup]]. Aars is a former [[railway town]]. It is currently the 76 largest city in Denmark just behind [[Ribe]] but in front of [[Helsinge]]. It is the 9th biggest town/city in [[Region Nordjylland]] in front of [[Skagen]] but behind [[S\u00e6by]].

The site name researcher Svend Aakj\u00e6r's statement was that it originates from the [[Old Norse]] / Old English word \u00e1rr or \u00e1rmadr (Ar in old English). Which in Danish means the king's ombudsman or [[earl]]. Another explanation is that it comes from the man name Aar / Ar.<ref>{{cite book|title=Nudansk Ordbog|date=1989|publisher=Politikens Forlag}}</ref>\n\n===Aars stone===\n[[File:\u00c5rs2 600px.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Aars stone]]\nAt the church in Aars there is a [[rune stone]] with the following inscription: (front) Asser put this stone after his lord Valtoke, (backside) The stone proclaims that it will stand here for a long time, it should mention Valtoke's varie. Valtoke full name was [[Valtoke Gormsson]] but he was also called [[Toke Gormsson]], and he was son of [[Gorm the old]] (Danish: Gorm den gamle).

From 1660, it was a part of Aalborghus Amt, but from 1970 to 2007, it was a part of [[Aalborg]] Amt until [[Aalborg]] Amt melted together with [[Hj\u00f8rring]] Amt and created Nordjyllands Amt (English: [[North Jutland County|North Jutland amt]]).<ref>{{cite web|title=Amt-herred-sogn siderne|url=https://www.slaegtogdata.dk/kilder/amt-herred-sogn}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=\u00c5rs Herred|url=https://da.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C3%85rs_Herred|website=da.wikipedia}}{{Circular reference|date=May 2017}}</ref>\n\n=== Railway town ===\n[[File:AalestrupL\u00f8gst\u00f8r28Baneg\u00e5rdsvej.JPG|thumb|The decommissioned railway has now been repurposed as the pathway ''Himmerlandsstien'']]\nIn 1875, there were 782 residents in [[Aars parish]]. In a description from around that time of the city is said \"Aars with Church, Priestegaard, School and Inn with Grocery Store, Bakery and Meltyard\". In 1880 there was another grocery store. The end of the 18th century was there a post office.\n\nIn 1893, the city received a state railway station on the Himmerlandsbaner from [[Hobro]] / [[Viborg, Denmark|Viborg]] via [[Aalestrup]] to [[L\u00f8gst\u00f8r]]. In 1899, Aars became [[Himmerland]]'s railroad junction. The private railway Aars-[[Nibe]]-[[Svenstrup, Aalborg Municipality|Svenstrup]] (-Aalborg) got a terminal here and was extended in 1910 from Aars to [[Hvalpsund (city)|Hvalpsund]]. The Great Rail Act of 1918 even opened the possibility that there should also be a Himmelland crossroads Aars-Arden-B\u00e6lum-\u00d8ster Hurup, but this course was never brought, like most projects in this law.\n\n[[Aalborg]]-[[Hvalpsund (city)|Hvalpsund]] Railway was closed in 1969. As early as 1966, DSB's passenger traffic at Aars Station was terminated. The freight traffic Viborg-L\u00f8gst\u00f8r continued with the expedition station in Aars, but ended in 1999. The station has been demolished, the track was taken up in 2006 and the former railway station is now shopstores. It will be used by the Himmerlands path to [[Viborg, Denmark|Viborg]] and [[L\u00f8gst\u00f8r]]. Nature trail [[Nibe]]-[[Hvalpsund (city)|Hvalpsund]] uses the railway line to Nibe, but follows L\u00f8gst\u00f8rvej in the first 2&nbsp;km towards [[Havbro]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Himmerlandsbanerne|url=http://www.baner-omkring-aalborg.dk/?Himmerlandsbanerne|website=Nordjyllands jernbaner}}</ref>\n\n{{clear left}}\n\n===Aars Municipality===\n{{main|Aars Municipality}}\n[[Aars Municipality]] was formed by Kommunalreformen in 1970 which made the Parishes into municipalities and in the Aars municipality the town of Aars was the head city/capital/municipal seat of the municipality. The municipality covered an area of 223&nbsp;km\u00b2 and had a total population of 13,284 in 2005. But in 2007, Aars Municipality ceased to exist and was merged with the former [[Fars\u00f8]], [[L\u00f8gst\u00f8r]], and [[Aalestrup]] municipalities to form the new [[Vesthimmerland municipality]], with an area of 768.08&nbsp;km\u00b2 (2013)<ref>{{cite web|title=noegletal.dk|url=http://www.noegletal.dk/}}</ref> and a total population of 38,277 (2008). The reason behind the merge was [[Municipalities of Denmark#Municipal Reform 2007|''Kommunalreformen'' (\"The Municipal Reform\" of 2007)]] which merged many of the now former municipalities into bigger municipalities. Aars Municipality also had what is called a Municipality shield which was a Cimbrian bull (Danish:cimbrertyren) with a red background. The bull symbolized that the [[Cimbri]] were present in what was the area in Aars Municipality. Even though Aars Municipality is a thing of the past, the municipality shield can still be found around the city, for example in manhole covers and in the city entrance sign.\n\n===Excavation===\nThe construction of a new bypass revealed 4000 year-old buildings. The archaeologists from [[Vesthimmerland Museum]] in Aars found a collection of houses they estimated to be around 4000 years old. However, there are only staggered tracks and other tracks, but overall, the findings show that the Aars area has been populated, and probably also densely populated for several thousands of years.\n\nThey have found traces of more houses. They assume that at least five of the houses are simultaneous. There is a trace of the [[plow]] type called an ard. Other things have also been found at the old houses. There have been found remains of an [[amber]], ceramic cut, Flintafslags and two [[axe]]s, a mountain axe and a single-grave axe.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Hansen|first1=Torsten|title=4000 \u00e5r gamle bygninger kom frem i lyset|url=http://www.aars.dk/nyheder/4000-aar-gamle-bygninger-kom-frem-i-lyset-3511|website=Aars.dk}}</ref>\n\n== Buildings ==\n[[File:Aars Kirke2.JPG|thumb|Aars Church]]\n\n=== The church ===\n{{main|Aars Church}}\n[[Aars Church]] is a Lutheran church. It was the church of the medieval {{Interlanguage link|Aars parish|da|Aars Sogn|vertical-align=sup}}. The original Romanesque building was extensively remodeled and was transformed into a cruciform church of considerable size in 1921. The oldest part is from around 1200. In 1937 Christian Andersen made the baptismal font.<ref>[http://www.visitnordjylland.com/ln-int/aars-church-gdk1079313 VisitNordjylland.com: Aars Church]</ref>\n\n=== The museum ===\nAars is renowned for the Vesthimmerlands Museum, with various exhibits on important regional cultural history and art. The museum was initiated in 1920 by [[Johannes V. Jensen]], and eventually built in 1935. In 1999 the native artist [[Per Kirkeby]] and architect [[Jens Bertelsen]] designed the new extension buildings and the museum has some of Per Kirkeby's artwork on display.\n\n===Water tower===\n{{main|Aars water tower}}\nThe tower is called Aars water tower since it is located in Aars city. The tower is built right in the middle of a very old water tank from where the city's original water supply went out. As it sounds, it was Aars's water tower. The building has many beautiful handicrafts. In the past, the tower used to have a neon logo on top showing the [[Cimbrian bull]] from Aars and [[Aars Municipality]] coat of arm/shield, but it was taken down. The tower was also a shop where you could buy yarn and many other things like tea cups. But the shop moved away from the tower.<ref>{{cite web|title=Aars Vandt\u00e5rn|url=http://www.aars.dk/aars-vandtaarn|website=Aars.dk}}</ref>\n\n===Aars Cinema===\nAars Cinema is the local [[Movie theater|cinema]] and the only one in Aars. It is a union-driven cinema, where the tasks are mainly performed by volunteers. The cinema is located in Aars hovedgade (English: Main street). The building has a man on the front of the building and other part of the building is painted with persons, some of the people painted are from ''[[Olsen-banden]]'' and it the 3 main characters Egon, Benny and Kjeld. It has two halls to show films in.

An [[EU]] grant of DKK 11.5 million became vacant, because the fiddle plug for the Aalborg House of Music ''[[Musikkens Hus]]'' project was waiting. In addition, the ALFA project received a grant of DKK 3.2 million from the [[EU]]. In 2008, Vesthimmerlands Musikhus ALFA (aka. Musikhuset) was finished, designed by architectural firm [[Kj\u00e6r & Richter]] in collaboration with Per Kirkeby.<ref>[http://vmalfa.dk/forside.aspx Vesthimmerlands Musikhus ALFA] {{in lang|da}}</ref>\n\nThe ALFA House of Music comprise a concert hall with room for 420 guests and several teaching facilities. ALFA is an acronym for [[Aalestrup]], [[L\u00f8gst\u00f8r]], [[Fars\u00f8]] and Aars, the four largest towns in the Vesthimmerland municipality, thus symbolizing the regional status of this cultural center.<ref>[http://vmalfa.dk/om-alfa.aspx Om ALFA] {{in lang|da}}</ref>\n\n==Education facilities==\n[[File:AarsSkoleMMadsensVej.jpg|thumb|Aars School]]\n\n===Aars School===\nAars skole or Aars school is one of two city schools located in Aars city.

Vestermarkskolen was founded as one of several schools around [[Denmark]] that was called: \"de gr\u00f8nne skoler\"(English: The green schools). The architect behind the schools was [[Erik Ejlers]]. He expressed himself Thus about the schools: \"The purpose of this work is to achieve harmony with the area in which the school is to be placed. The urbanization means that these schools will lie in gardens - in the best sense of the word.\" Since 1966, major improvements have been made to the buildings and the areas around the buildings. They are proud of their frameworks and, they receive much recognition for those of daily users and guests.

This began an exchange of artillery fire that continued for three hours. Several of the American guns were silenced, including the 32-pounder, a 24-pounder, and a 12-pounder, while some damage was done to the earthworks.

Percy Moran]], ''The Battle of New Orleans'' (1910)]]\nThe 93rd Highlanders were ordered to leave Keane's assault column advancing along the river, possibly because of Thornton's delay in crossing the river and the artillery fire that might hit them, and to move across the open field to join the main force on the right. Keane fell wounded as he crossed the field with the 93rd. Rennie's men managed to attack and overrun an American advance redoubt next to the river, but they could neither hold the position nor successfully storm the main American line behind it without reinforcements. Within a few minutes, the American 7th Infantry arrived, moved forward, and fired upon the British in the captured redoubt; within half an hour, Rennie and nearly all of his men were dead. In the main attack on the right, the British infantrymen flung themselves to the ground, huddled in the canal, or were mowed down by a combination of musket fire and grapeshot from the Americans. A handful made it to the top of the parapet on the right, but they were killed or captured. The 95th Rifles had advanced in open skirmish order ahead of the main assault force and were concealed in the ditch below the parapet, unable to advance further without support.\n\nThe two large main assaults were repulsed. Pakenham and Major General Samuel Gibbs, his second in command, were fatally wounded while on horseback by grapeshot fired from the earthworks. Major Wilkinson of the 21st Regiment reformed his lines and made a third assault. They were able to reach the entrenchments and attempted to scale them. Wilkinson made it to the top before being shot. The Americans were amazed at his bravery and carried him behind the rampart. The British soldiers stood out in the open and were shot apart with grapeshot from Line Jackson, including the 93rd Highlanders, having no orders to advance further or retreat. General Lambert was in the reserve and took command. He gave the order for his reserve to advance and ordered the withdrawal of the army.

The expedition to New Orleans originated with that colleague\u2026.

The Americans suffered roughly 250 casualties, while the British suffered roughly 2,000 overall.\n\n==Background==\nIn August 1814, Britain and the United States began diplomatic negotiations to end the [[War of 1812]].<ref>https://smallwarsjournal.com/jrnl/art/battle-new-orleans-joint-strategic-and-operational-planning-lessons-learned</ref> However, British Secretary of War [[Henry Bathurst, 3rd Earl Bathurst|Henry Bathurst]] wrote Pakenham's secret orders of October 24, 1814, commanding him to continue prosecuting the war even if he heard rumors of a peace treaty being signed. Bathurst expressed concern that the United States might not ratify such a treaty, thus continuing the war, and he did not want Pakenham to endanger his troops or miss an opportunity to gain an advantage over the American army.<ref>https://www.napoleon-series.org/military/Warof1812/2011/Issue16/c_PakenhamOrders.html}</ref>\n\n==Prelude==\n===Lake Borgne===\n{{main|Battle of Lake Borgne}}\n[[File:Lake Borgne de la Tour map 1720.jpg|left|thumb|[[Lake Borgne]], Louisiana, 1720.]]\nSixty British ships had anchored in the Gulf of Mexico to the east of [[Lake Pontchartrain]] and [[Lake Borgne]] by December 14, 1814 with 14,450 soldiers and sailors aboard under the command of Admiral Sir [[Alexander Cochrane]].<ref>Smith, Zachary F., pp.1-2.<br>Smith describes the expedition as a fleet of 60 ships, nearly half of which were \"formidable warships, the best of the English navy\" that had transported some 18,000 men, including 14,450 soldiers and sailors, \"veterans in the service of their country in the lines of their respective callings, to complete the equipment of this powerful armada\".</ref><ref>Refer to the map of Louisiana.</ref> An American flotilla of five gunboats prevented their access to the lakes, commanded by Lieutenant [[Thomas ap Catesby Jones]].

This began an exchange of artillery fire that continued for three hours. Several of the American guns were silenced, including the 32-pounder, a 24-pounder, and a 12-pounder, while some damage was done to the earthworks. The British artillery finally exhausted its ammunition, and Pakenham canceled the attack. He did not know that his attack had come close to success, as the American defenders on the left of Line Jackson near the swamp had broken under the fire and abandoned their position. Pakenham decided to wait for his entire force of over 8,000 men to assemble before continuing his attack. The British regulars included the [[King's Own Royal Regiment (Lancaster)|4th]], [[Royal Fusiliers|7th]], [[Royal Fusiliers|21st]], [[27th (Inniskilling) Regiment of Foot|27th]], [[43rd (Monmouthshire) Regiment of Foot|43rd]], [[44th (East Essex) Regiment of Foot|44th]], [[Royal Fusiliers|85th]], [[93rd (Sutherland Highlanders) Regiment of Foot|93rd Highlanders]], a 500-man \"demi-battalion\" of the [[Rifle Brigade (The Prince Consort's Own)|95th Rifle Brigade]], [[14th King's Hussars|14th Light Dragoons]], and the 1st and 5th [[West India Regiments]] of several hundred free black soldiers recruited from the British West Indies colonies.

Percy Moran]], ''The Battle of New Orleans'' (1910)]]\nThe 93rd Highlanders were ordered to leave Keane's assault column advancing along the river, possibly because of Thornton's delay in crossing the river and the artillery fire that might hit them, and to move across the open field to join the main force on the right. Keane fell wounded as he crossed the field with the 93rd. Rennie's men managed to attack and overrun an American advance redoubt next to the river, but they could neither hold the position nor successfully storm the main American line behind it without reinforcements. Within a few minutes, the American 7th Infantry arrived, moved forward, and fired upon the British in the captured redoubt; within half an hour, Rennie and nearly all of his men were dead. In the main attack on the right, the British infantrymen flung themselves to the ground, huddled in the canal, or were mowed down by a combination of musket fire and grapeshot from the Americans. A handful made it to the top of the parapet on the right, but they were killed or captured. The 95th Rifles had advanced in open skirmish order ahead of the main assault force and were concealed in the ditch below the parapet, unable to advance further without support.\n\nThe two large main assaults were repulsed. Pakenham and Major General Samuel Gibbs, his second in command, were fatally wounded while on horseback by grapeshot fired from the earthworks. Major Wilkinson of the 21st Regiment reformed his lines and made a third assault. They were able to reach the entrenchments and attempted to scale them. Wilkinson made it to the top before being shot. The Americans were amazed at his bravery and carried him behind the rampart. The British soldiers stood out in the open and were shot apart with grapeshot from Line Jackson, including the 93rd Highlanders, having no orders to advance further or retreat. General Lambert was in the reserve and took command. He gave the order for his reserve to advance and ordered the withdrawal of the army.

The [[Arthur Wellesley, 1st Duke of Wellington|Duke of Wellington]] held that Cochrane was largely at fault for the campaign's failure, and that the British attack could have succeeded were it not for the Admiral's shortcomings. He held Pakenham in high regard and commented in his eulogy:<blockquote>\nI cannot but regret that he was ever employed on such a service or with such a colleague. The expedition to New Orleans originated with that colleague\u2026. The Americans were prepared with an army in a fortified position which still would have been carried, if the duties of others, that is of the Admiral [Cochrane], had been as well performed as that of he whom we now lament.<ref>Holmes, Richard (2003).

They spent the night before the battle praying and crying before the statue, begging for the Virgin Mary's intercession. Rev. William Dubourg offered Mass at the altar on the morning of January 8, and Mother Ste. Marie Olivier de Vezin, prioress of the abbey, vowed to have a Mass of Thanksgiving sung annually should the American forces win. A courier ran into the chapel during communion to inform them that the British had been defeated. General Jackson went to the convent himself to thank the nuns for their prayers. \"By the blessing of heaven, directing the valor of the troops under my command, one of the most brilliant victories in the annals of war was obtained.\"<ref>Records of the American Catholic Historical Society of Philadelphia, Volume 23, By American Catholic Historical Society of Philadelphia, p. 128 (1912).</ref>  The vow made by Mother Ste.

Teleserye is derived from two [[Filipino language|Filipino]] words: \"tele\", which is short for \"''telebisy\u00f3n''\" (television) and \"''s\u00e9rye''\" (series).\n\nTeleseryes share some characteristics and have similar roots with classic soap operas and ''telenovelas'', yet the teleserye has evolved into a genre with its own unique characteristics, often working as a social realist reflection of Filipino reality. Teleseryes are aired in prime-time,  afternoon, five days a week. They attract a broad audience crossing age and gender lines, and command the highest advertising rates in the Philippine television industry. The series last anywhere from three months to a year, or even longer, depending on their rating.\n\nOther forms of Philippine dramas include \"serials\" and \"anthologies\", which are usually shown on a weekly basis. These dramas are also intended to air a finite number of episodes usually lasting one season depending on the ratings.\n\n==History==\n\n===1950s-1980s===\nSoap operas in the Philippines originated when ''[[Gulong ng Palad]]'' (Wheel of Fortune) was first heard on the radio in 1949. The genre then expanded into television in the early 1960s. The first Philippine TV soap opera was ''[[Hiwaga sa Bahay na Bato]]'' (Mystery at the Stone House) in 1963, and was produced by [[ABS-CBN]]. ''Larawan ng Pag-ibig'' (Picture of Love), ''Prinsipe Amante'' (Prince Amante), and many others soon followed.<ref>[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8kokyGX5B_M 60 Years of Philippine Soap Operas]</ref>\n\n''[[Gulong ng Palad]]'', co-written by revival writer Loida Virina, was the longest-running radio serial that spanned for two decades until the mid 80s. It was made into a television soap opera starring [[Marianne Dela Riva]] and [[Ronald Corveau]], created stars out of many young actors like [[Romnick Sarmenta]] and starred veteran actress [[Caridad Sanchez]] whose popularity helped sustain the soap's lifetime.\n\nDuring the [[Martial law in the Philippines|martial law period]] from 1972 to 1986, the government closed several networks, including [[ABS-CBN]], leaving [[Radio Philippines Network|RPN-9]] and [[GMA Network|GMA]] as the only two commercial television networks in the country, but the lack of multi-network media base also aided the emergence of nationwide satellite broadcasting, spurring a dramatic growth of afternoon and primetime sitcoms and serials as a result of the fierce competition between the two networks. During this time, Philippine TV schedules resemble those in the U.S., with networks scheduling different shows per timeblock daily, in contrast with the country's modern weekday setup among its teleseryes, and separate weekend programming.\n\nRPN-9 produced ''[[Maria Flordeluna|Flordeluna]]'', starring award-winning actress [[Janice de Belen]]. The cast also included \"Drama King\" Dindo Fernando and award-winning actress and director [[Laurice Guillen]]. At the same time, GMA produced the hit tale ''[[Anna Liza]]'' starring child actress and FAMAS awardee [[Julie Vega]]. Prior to the formal introduction of [[AGB Nielsen Philippines|TV ratings system]] in the Philippines in the 1990s, both shows epitomized one of the biggest rivalries in Philippine showbiz history between Vega and de Belen (despite being highlighted as bestfriends offscreen). However, ''Anna Liza'' was cancelled in 1985 due to Julie Vega's death and as a result, the series had an unfinished storyline and a two-hour special in 1986, which was supposedly its final year on air. Both series were controversial from the start due to the rivalry between the fanbases of the two lead young actresses.\n\n===1990s===\nUntil the late 1980s, Philippine television dramas were broadcast in afternoon timeblocks. ABS-CBN resumed operations after the expulsion of the [[Ferdinand Marcos|Marcos dictatorship]] in 1986 and regained its lead among rival networks in audience ratings by the end of the decade. In the early and around the mid-1990s, local sitcoms dominated Philippine television, with the rise of ABS-CBN's ''[[Palibhasa Lalake]]'' and political satire ''[[Abangan Ang Susunod Na Kabanata]]'', and GMA Network's ''[[Bubble Gang]]''. The same decade, however, saw a new wave of international television phenomenon sweeping the Philippines, starting with the '[[telenovela|telenovela craze]]' over ABS-CBN's imported Mexican dramas.\n\nThe most popular were the ''Las Tres Marias'' Trilogy produced by the world-leading [[Televisa]] and starred by [[Thal\u00eda]] (starting with ''[[Maria Mercedes (telenovela)|Maria Mercedes]]'' shown on ABS-CBN and ''[[Marimar (Mexican telenovela)|Marimar]]'' and later, ''[[Maria la del Barrio]]'', shown on RPN-9, both as primetime shows). By this time, major networks began to reschedule locally made telenovelas into primetime slots to encourage more Filipino audiences to watch at night and for advertisers to invest more on these shows. By the mid-1990s, teleseryes surpassed sitcoms (both in number of shows produced and in nationwide audience ratings) as the most dominant form of primetime television in the Philippines.\n\nOne of the country's most well-known TV shows is ABS-CBN's pioneering network-grown drama ''[[Mara Clara]]'', which run from 1992 to 1997, gaining nationwide popularity due to the intense rivalry between its two stars and characters - [[Judy Ann Santos]] as the protagonist Mara and [[Gladys Reyes]] as the evil antagonist Clara. The series still stands as the longest-running teleserye in the post-Martial Law era of Philippine television, experiencing frequent timeslot changes before settling into the standard 7:00 P.M.-8:00 P.M. primetime block by late 1995 head-to-head with the ongoing re-airing of ''Marimar'' on RPN-9. ''Mara Clara'' is also credited for being the country's first successful teleserye to spawn a similarly successful movie under the same name. Santos' career would peak between 1997 and 1999 with her ABS-CBN series ''[[Esperanza (Philippine TV series)|Esperanza]]'', which also had a separate film made after its finale. A 1997 ''Esperanza'' episode currently holds the record for the [[List of most watched television broadcasts|all-time highest rated single episode]] for any Philippine television series.\n\nIn mid-1997, another ABS-CBN series, ''[[Mula sa Puso]]'', marked the rise of [[Claudine Barretto]] as one of the country's most prominent actresses, where she played the heiress Via in the 2-year-long soap, together with the late [[Rico Yan]] and [[Diether Ocampo]] as her leading men, and [[Princess Punzalan]] as Selina, the most influential character of the series. The show also marked a shift in the Philippine television market by the late 1990s, as ''Mula Sa Puso'' became known for being the country's first middle-class primetime series - a huge break from the preceding Filipino telenovelas with mass-appealing protagonists from the lower socio-economic classes.\n\nPunzalan's antagonist performance is highly regarded among the best on Philippine television and is still widely touted as the basis for all of the succeeding teleserye villains, and the rivalry between her character and [[Jacklyn Jose]]'s (as Via's mother Magda) became a standard for confrontation scenes of TV series in the succeeding decades on Philippine television. Simultaneously running with ''Esperanza'', both programs pioneered crossover episodes among Philippine teleserye during the same period, and ''Mula sa Puso'' spawned another successful movie after its finale in 1999. Both shows also helped ABS-CBN dominate as the country's leading television network by the late 1990s for more than 10 straight years running, ranking competitively as Philippines' 2 most watched overall TV series in every year on air.\n\nMeanwhile, rival network's GMA retained and even popularized their afternoon serialized dramas form such as ''[[Villa Quintana]]'' with lead stars [[Donna Cruz]] as Lynette Quintana and [[Keempee de Leon]] as Isagani Samonte with [[Isabel Rivas]] as Stella Quintana which airs from 1995 to 1997. This was followed by ''[[Ikaw Na Sana]]'' with lead characters [[Angelu de Leon]] as Blanca Rosales Perez / Susan Saavedra and [[Bobby Andrews]] as Rafael Huico with Gladys Reyes as Angela Rosales which airs between 1997 and 1998, and a film was made after this show. At the peak of both these GMA afternoon shows' fame, they were moved to primetime slots by the end of the 1990s to compete with ABS-CBN's rise on national television with their primetime serials, a foreshadow of what would eventually be the touted primetime television series blocks for both rival networks.\n\n===2000s===\nModern Philippine television dramas have begun to evolve to today's modern form called ''teleserye'', a portmanteau of the Filipino words \"telebisyon\" (\"television\") and \"serye\" (\"series\"). The term originated from the ABS-CBN hit drama ''[[Pangako Sa 'Yo]]'', airing from 2000 to 2002 and starring [[Jericho Rosales]] and [[Kristine Hermosa]], and the iconic rivalry between actresses [[Eula Valdez]] as the original Amor de Jesus-Powers and [[Jean Garcia]] as the original Claudia Buenavista. The tandem of Valdez and Garcia in the original ''Pangako Sa'Yo'' is widely regarded as the most successful rivalry of main characters in all of Philippine television, setting the standards for future teleserye ensemble casts.\n\n''Pangako Sa'Yo'' is dubbed as the country's first ever teleserye and was considered one of the most significant turning points in Philippine television history due to its pioneering cinematic production and modified fast-paced, multiple-arc story structure distinguishing it from previous Filipino telenovelas. It was broadcast internationally in many networks across the Americas, Africa and Asia, and remains the most successful Philippine television series internationally. At the end of its run in 2002, ''Pangako Sa 'Yo'' remains as the record-holder of the [[List of most watched television broadcasts|all-time highest rated series finale episode]] for any locally made program in Philippine television history, and firmly established the current primetime block of ABS-CBN.\n\n''Pangako Sa 'Yo'' effectively became the highest rated teleserye by average, both domestically and internationally, in all of Philippine television history, and inspired ABS-CBN to produce (in mid-2002) its leadout teleserye, ''[[Kay Tagal Kang Hinintay]]''. Already concluded in 2003, the show introduced the highly acclaimed tandem of [[John Lloyd Cruz]] and [[Bea Alonzo]] as one of the country's most successful long-established television and film loveteams until today. Also known for the iconic performance of [[Lorna Tolentino]] as the protagonist twins Lorrea and Lorrinda Guinto, it became the nation's first ever local television series to become a finalist to the Best Drama Series category of the [[International Academy of Television Arts and Sciences|International Emmy Awards]] in 2003, marking the rise of the Philippines on the world television programming stage.\n\nRosales and Hermosa, along with [[Diether Ocampo]] and [[Angelika dela Cruz]], would altogether star in another teleserye classic, ''[[Sana'y Wala Nang Wakas]]''. Airing between 2003 and 2004, ''Sana'y Wala Nang Wakas'' became the world's first ever drama series allowing its viewers to choose the story's ending through text messaging. Another groundbreaking teleserye of ABS-CBN was ''[[Basta't Kasama Kita]]'', airing around the same period as of ''Sana'y Wala Nang Wakas''. Starring Judy Ann Santos and [[Robin Padilla]], the show was notable for its depiction of the country's [[National Bureau of Investigation (Philippines)|National Bureau of Investigation]] and for being the country's first ever local television series to broadcast a [[live television|live]] series finale episode in 2004. This introduced the live format of series finales among fictional series on Philippine television - a feat only few teleseryes had accomplished until today. Both series followed ''Pangako Sa'Yo'' to be broadcast abroad, marking the rise of Philippines to international prominence in television drama production.\n\nABS-CBN's fortunes would soon increase with its 1999-2001 series ''[[Saan Ka Man Naroroon]]'' starring [[Claudine Barretto]] on lead role as triplets Rosemarie, Rosenda and Rosario. The show was critically acclaimed and became one of the few groundbreaking shows of the 2000s in the Philippines starring a female lead character, as well as the country's first teleserye with at least two characters portrayed simultaneously by one actor.\n\nBarretto would consequently gain prominence for her lead role on ''[[Sa Dulo Ng Walang Hanggan]]'' a timeless love story of the undying love of Angeline Crisostomo/Angelina whose mistakes that appear in the present had also happened in the past; it uncovered the lies and the love of all around her which was actually reincarnated into the present. She was also the lead star of the popular teleserye ''[[Marina (Philippine TV series)|Marina]]''. Airing in 2004, the show popularized the [[Fantaserye and telefantasya|fantasy]] theme throughout most of the incoming teleseryes in the Philippines, becoming the first original fantasy series made for television to score success on Philippine primetime television ratings.\n\nThe Philippines began emerging as one of the world's largest television drama-producing nations in the mid-2000s. Several of its international hits include the 2006 remake of ''[[Gulong ng Palad]]'' on ABS-CBN, with its cast including [[Kristine Hermosa]] as Luisa, [[TJ Trinidad]] as Carding and [[Cherie Gil]] as Philiomena \"Menang\" Medel, the corrupt town mayor and also the main antagonist of the series. The role of Mimi was given to [[Andrea del Rosario]] and [[Rio Locsin]] as Caridad \"Idad\" Santos. The series was popular amongst international viewers, through [[The Filipino Channel|TFC]]. In 2007, the remake of ''[[Maria Flordeluna]]'', which previously aired on RPN-9 through most of the 1970s and 1980s, starred young actress [[Eliza Pineda]] as the titular character. It also starred [[Albert Martinez]] as Leo Alicante, [[Eula Valdez]] as Mary Jo Esperitu and [[John Estrada]] as Gary Alvarado. The series ran on ABS-CBN for 93 episodes and won the PMPC Star Awards Best Television Series in 2008, and popularized the trend of remaking classic child-starred Philippine telenovelas of the past.\n\nTo pit against its rival network, GMA Network started producing their own set of primetime soap opera starting with the top-rating drama series, ''[[Ikaw Lang Ang Mamahalin]]'' starring drama actress [[Angelika dela Cruz]] which aired from 2001 to 2002 and ''[[Sana Ay Ikaw Na Nga]]'' starring [[Dingdong Dantes]].  It was successfully shown in Malaysia and other Asian countries. Another was the political drama, ''[[Kung Mawawala Ka]]'' also became one of the most loved powerful dramas which revolved on politics and even on issues of corruption. Starring [[Eddie Garcia]] as the show's main character (and lead antagonist), it also showed the dramatic abilities of actresses [[Hilda Koronel]], Liza Lorena and [[Gloria Diaz]] as the powerful wives. The series ran between 2001 and 2002 and also won a PMPC Award from the Philippine Movie Press Club. It was also the most popular GMA-made drama (as well as the most successful single telenovela) pitted against the ongoing television drama ''Pangako Sa 'Yo'' which also reached its end in 2002.\n\nIt was not until 2004, however, when GMA Network overtook ABS-CBN in the national ratings when the former introduced an all-fantaserye (a portmanteau of \"fantasy\" and teleserye, i.e. fantasy-themed teleseryes) primetime slate by 2005, through the successful broadcasts of female-lead shows such as ''[[Encantadia]]'', which originally starred [[Iza Calzado]], [[Karylle]], [[Sunshine Dizon]] and [[Diana Zubiri]], and ''[[Mulawin]]'', starring the successful tandem of [[Angel Locsin]] and [[Richard Gutierrez]]. GMA earned ratings foothold against its main rival ABS-CBN during this time when it brought life to ''[[Darna (2005 TV series)|Darna]]'', a role reprised by the most famous Darna of all time, [[Vilma Santos]] (in the late 1970s and early 1980s), and starring [[Angel Locsin]] in its first television remake, and ushered the era of film-turned-TV remakes on Philippine television.\n\nProminent film-turned-TV remakes in the Philippines in the 2000s include ''[[Panday (2005 TV series)|Panday]]'' which starred [[Jericho Rosales]] and [[Heart Evangelista]], and the remake of ''[[Mga Anghel na Walang Langit]]'' and ''[[Kampanerang Kuba]]'' which starred [[Anne Curtis]], all made by ABS-CBN. The \"''sineserye''\" genre was introduced on Philippine television in this decade through ''[[Bituing Walang Ningning]]'' which starred [[Sarah Geronimo]] and [[Angelika de la Cruz]], reprising the iconic roles of [[Sharon Cuneta]] and [[Cherie Gil]] won prominence and also produced a concert. It also came to be known as having \"The Grand Finale\" as this introduced the format of series finale stretched to 5 days on the final week on Philippine television. ''Bituing Walang Ningning'' remains the all-time highest rated regular musical television drama series in the Philippines.\n\nBy the late 2000s, GMA-7 and ABS-CBN would soon embark on one of the country's most heated rivalries for the most watched television network. GMA aired its 2007 remake of the international telenovela ''[[Marimar (2007 TV series)|MariMar]]'' which starred [[Marian Rivera]] and [[Dingdong Dantes]] (then remade in 2015 for a second time with [[Marimar (2015 TV series)|the same title]] starring [[Megan Young]] and [[Tom Rodriguez]]). The remake, highlighted as one of the world's most successful international remakes of any former Latinovela, boosted GMA's short-term dominance as the most watched television network in the country during the year. Meanwhile, during the second half of the 2000s, three ABS-CBN-made TV series became popular: the remake of the 1977\u20131985 soap opera ''[[Gulong ng Palad]]'', the teleserye ''[[Sa Piling Mo]]'' and the series ''[[Maging Sino Ka Man]]''. The latter became the most popular teleserye internationally after ''Pangako Sa'Yo'' and boosted the careers of [[John Lloyd Cruz]], [[Bea Alonzo]], [[Sam Milby]] and [[Anne Curtis]].\n\nOn the year 2008, ABS-CBN produced its most expensive series ''[[Lobo (TV series)|Lobo]]'', about two opposing groups in the story\u2014the Luna and the Waya. The show starred [[Piolo Pascual]] and [[Angel Locsin]], in the latter's first major project on ABS-CBN after transferring from GMA Network in one of Philippine television's most controversial network switches by any actor to date. Locsin's performance was the first from any Filipino to be nominated to the [[International Emmy Award for Best Actress|International Emmys]] for a leading role. The members of the Luna organization have a grudge against the werewolves while the Waya are the protectors of the Lobo (the werewolves), and they want them to co-exist harmoniously with normal humans.\n\nThe year 2008 also marked the international success of the [[I Love Betty La Fea|Philippine remake]] of the world-hit Colombian original telenovela ''[[Yo soy Betty, la fea]]''. Starring Bea Alonzo, it became the most successful Philippine remake of any Latinovela since the 2007 Marimar remake starring Marian Rivera on GMA Network. Alonzo's portrayal gained widespread prominence through most of Asia on her titular character, and was vital in ABS-CBN's defeat of GMA as the country's most watched television network at the end of the decade.\n\n===2010s===\n\nBy the 2010s, ABS-CBN and GMA Network would rival in their claims as the most watched network in the Philippines. While GMA Network appeals to most of the viewers in [[Mega Manila]] (through their shows that are said to be [[Imperial Manila|Manila-centric]] in setting) beginning the mid-2000s, most primetime shows from ABS-CBN appeal widely to other regions in the country, particularly in the sought-after audiences of [[Visayas]] and [[Mindanao]]. Local media experts attribute this trend to ABS-CBN's return to original Filipino programming.\n\nABS-CBN's ratings success since the late 2000s was initiated by the success of the 2009 teleserye ''[[May Bukas Pa]]''. Starring [[Zaijian Jaranilla]] as the iconic Santino, the show became the first successful religious-themed series on Philippine television, as well as the most successful child-starred Philippine television series since the 1985 demise of the original ''Anna Liza'' of Julie Vega on GMA Network. ''May Bukas Pa'' also became the first Philippine primetime television series to have lasted at least one full year (since ''Sa Dulo ng Walang Hanggan'' in 2001-2003), ending in 2010 as the country's all-time most watched TV show since Philippine television [[Kantar Media|switched to nationwide TV ratings system]].\n\n2010 featured some of Philippine television's strongest original teleseryes such as ''[[Dahil May Isang Ikaw]]'', which became the comeback project of the tandem of Kristine Hermosa and Jericho Rosales, and revitalized the careers of veteran actors such as [[Lorna Tolentino]], [[John Estrada]], [[Chin Chin Gutierrez]] and [[Gabby Concepcion]]. The show, which aired on ABS-CBN, was the first primetime project of GMA Network transferees [[Karylle]] and [[Sid Lucero]], the latter of whom remains the only Filipino male to be nominated at the [[International Emmy Awards]] for a leading role in any TV series. This was followed up by the fantaserye ''[[Agua Bendita]]'', which was the first primetime show with titular characters starred by [[Xyriel Manabat]] and [[Andi Eigenmann]] in its earlier and latter stages, marking the trend for child-starred original Filipino programming. Manabat would soon star in ABS-CBN's critical hit ''[[100 Days to Heaven]]'', which also marked the primetime return of actresses [[Coney Reyes]] and [[Jodi Santamaria|Jodi Sta. Maria]].\n\nBeginning 2011, however, the mass transfer of some actors and actresses between ABS-CBN and GMA became a common trend on Philippine television. Moreover, both networks' hold on primetime television programming in the country would soon be challenged by [[TV5 (Philippines)|TV5]] with its debut teleserye offering in ''[[Babaeng Hampaslupa]]'', which starred with [[Alex Gonzaga]], [[Alice Dixson]] and [[Susan Roces]]. To date, its most recent offering was the 2016 series ''[[Bakit Manipis ang Ulap?]]'' (produced by [[Viva Entertainment]], based on the 1985 film of the same title created by Danny Zialcita) with [[Diether Ocampo]], [[Claudine Barretto]], [[Cesar Montano]] and [[Meg Imperial]].\n\n2010s also marked the start of broadcast of teleseryes induced with storylines known to have reflected some of the controversial issues facing the Philippines nowadays. For instance, Julia Montes and newcomer [[Coco Martin]] starred in the 2012 ABS-CBN hit ''[[Walang Hanggan (TV series)|Walang Hanggan]]''. Known for tackling issues on [[adultery]] and [[infidelity]] among Filipino households, the romantic drama featured the primetime return of veteran actors [[Richard Gomez]] and [[Dawn Zulueta]], and also gained wide popularity in most of Southeast Asia during its run, becoming the first Philippine television series to win in its ratings timeslot in all of its episodes. The show is also the country's second all-time highest-rated TV show since its final episode in 2012, and marked Martin's successful transition from the [[independent film|Filipino indie scene]] to become the foremost actor of the current era of Philippine television.\n\nAnother popular ABS-CBN teleserye was the 2012-2013 series ''[[Ina, Kapatid, Anak (TV series)|Ina, Kapatid, Anak]]''. Known for the heated on-and-offscreen rivalry of both actresses [[Kim Chiu]] and [[Maja Salvador]] during its run, as well as the primetime comeback of veteran actresses [[Cherry Pie Picache]] and Janice de Belen, the show gained national prominence for its open discussion of [[surrogacy|mother surrogacy]] - a topic previously but highly prohibited on Philippine media - and using the [[University of the Philippines Diliman|University of the Philippines]] (the country's national university) as its main setting.\n\nSalvador would later team up with Angel Locsin in the highly acclaimed 2014 series ''[[The Legal Wife]]'' in the same network. The show, which also talked about infidelity and adultery, marked the Jericho Rosales's first work with Salvador and Locsin, and the first ABS-CBN primetime show by GMA Network transferee [[JC de Vera]], was known for its controversial open-ended series finale among Locsin, Salvador and Rosales' characters, and for ranking to date as the country's most watched TV show nationwide for a late primetime slot. The family-oriented ABS-CBN daytime romantic drama ''[[Be Careful With My Heart]]'' (aired by ABS-CBN) introduced the highly successful tandem of [[Jodi Santamaria|Jodi Sta. Maria]] and [[Richard Yap]], and became the first teleserye to exceed 2 years in its overall run (from July 9, 2012 until November 28, 2014 with a total of 622 episodes). The show has since become the most successful Philippine television series on daytime block in and out of the Philippines.\n\n2013 also marked the television comeback of [[Judy Ann Santos]] through the ABS-CBN revenge thriller drama ''[[Huwag Ka Lang Mawawala]]'', which also starred [[Sam Milby]] and [[KC Concepcion]] (in both of their debut antagonist roles). The short-lived series, however, was notable for its depiction of [[women's empowerment]] in the Philippine context, as well as infidelity, and would peak in the ratings after it was transferred to the late primetime slot, eventually emerging as the country's second highest-rated TV show of all time in that timeblock. The show marked one of the very few times a Filipino TV program was transferred to a much latter airing time and attract more viewers leading up to any series finale.\n\nGMA Network, however, scored a major milestone by being the country's most expersive and first historical drama series ''[[Amaya (TV series)|Amaya]]'', starting [[Marian Rivera]] as a title role with [[Sid Lucero]], who transfer to the network after leaving ABS-CBN and newcomer [[Mikael Daez]]. It becomes the most highest ratings of all time including the finale episode. It was also Rivera's breakthrough role since Marimar. Also that year, Rivera gained another fame through the Philippine adaptation of a popular Korean series, ''[[Temptation of Wife (2012 TV series)|Temptation Of Wife]]'' alongside with [[Dennis Trillo]],  [[Glaiza de Castro]] & formerly ABS-CBN star [[Rafael Rosell]]. It becomes the most watching ratings of the series, with de Castro character Heidi, was widspread accliam praised by critcs for her antagonist role and her character rival with Rivera's character. \n\nTrillo later appears on the first ever television network to air a [[homosexuality|gay-themed]] primetime series. In 2013, the short-lived but popular teleserye ''[[My Husband's Lover]]'', starring newcomer [[Tom Rodriguez]] and [[Carla Abellana]], emerged as a hot topic of national conversation due to their portrayal in the show, which discussed about [[homosexuality]] - a widespread but controversial topic given the country's longstanding [[Roman Catholic Church|Catholic]] values and teachings. It has also gained prominence for being a widely viewed show despite being pitted against the simultaneously running ''Ina, Kapatid, Anak'' that has also since become a hit in and out of the Philippines. GMA Network would soon gain its ratings momentum with its [[Encantadia (2016 TV series)|2016-2017 remake]] of its iconic fantaserye (portmanteau for \"fantasy-themed\" teleserye) ''[[Encantadia (2005 TV series)|Encantadia]]'', marking the continuity of the trend for revivals of 2000s teleseryes on Philippine television initially popularized by ABS-CBN.\n\nIn 2009, the series remake of AnnaLiza was shelved which was to star Maja Salvador and Jason Abalos, but finally revived again in 2013 (with child star Andrea Brillantes in the title role). Together with the earlier success of the 2007 remake of ''Maria Flordeluna'' and the 2010 remake of ''[[Mara Clara (2010 TV series)|Mara Clara]]'', which introduced mainstream actresses [[Julia Montes]] and [[Kathryn Bernardo]], ABS-CBN popularized the concept of revival of previously massive hit teenager-starred telenovelas of the previous decades on Philippine television. The 2010 remake of ''Mara Clara'' is regarded as the single most successful remake of any previous Filipino telenovela dating from the 20th century.\n\nThis would be followed up by the [[Pangako Sa 'Yo (2015 TV series)|2015 remake]] of ''Pangako Sa'Yo'' (still under ABS-CBN), starring the trio of Jodi Sta. Maria, [[Angelica Panganiban]] and [[Ian Veneracion]] as the new-generation characters Amor de Jesus-Powers, Claudia Buenavista and Eduardo Buenavista, respectively. Also known as the first major drama project of the widely popular tandem of [[Kathryn Bernardo]] and [[Daniel Padilla]] as the leads Yna Macaspac and Angelo Buenavista, respectively, the show, which ended in 2016, garnered mixed reviews but wide commercial success, making it the most successful remake of any 2000s Philippine teleserye to date. However, Sta. Maria, who portrayed the role of Lia Buenavista in the original ''Pangako Sa'Yo'' (and of which was portrayed by Brillantes in the remake), garnered rave reviews for her new-generation portrayal of Amor de Jesus-Powers (previously acted by Eula Valdez), and remains the most recent Asian actress to be nominated at the [[International Emmy Awards]] for a leading role as of {{CURRENT YEAR}}.\n\nMore teleseryes earned renewed international popularity by 2016, courtesy of ''[[Bridges of Love]]'' (that ran from March 16 to August 7, 2015 on ABS-CBN), starring Rosales, Salvador and [[Paulo Avelino]], under the title ''Puentes de Amor'', the first Philippine drama aired in Latin America, which began on April 25, 2016 on [[Panamericana Televisi\u00f3n]] in [[Peru]]. The same year, Martin starred in the currently running 2015 series ''[[Ang Probinsyano]]'', gaining national attention for its bold portrayal of the country's ongoing [[Philippine Drug War|anti-illegal drugs campaign]] and the [[Philippine National Police]] despite renewed nationwide television censors by the [[Movie and Television Review and Classification Board|MTRCB]].\n\nABS-CBN's recent announcement of the show's run extension until 2020 made ''Ang Probinsyano'' the longest-running overall teleserye to ever debut in the 21st century on Philippine television, which the show is slated to overtake the 1992-1997 original run of ''Mara Clara'' as the country's longest-running TV series since the [[People Power Revolution]] in 1986. The show is also the all-time most dominant show on Philippine television based on [[Kantar Media|TV ratings]], as it has occupied the [[AGB Nielsen Philippines|top spot]] non-stop every year since its inception in 2015.\n\nSalvador would soon star in the hit 2017-2018 series ''[[Wildflower (TV series)|Wildflower]]'' as the main characters Lily Cruz/Ivy Aguas. The show was notable for revitalizing the careers of veteran actors [[Tirso Cruz III]], [[Aiko Melendez]], [[Sunshine Cruz]], [[Christian Vasquez]] and [[Wendell Ramos]], for the primetime debuts of television newcomers [[Joseph Marco]], [[Vin Abrenica]], [[RK Bagatsing]], [[Yen Santos]] and [[Roxanne Barcelo]], and for being the first Philippine teleserye to portray controversial political topics such as [[nepotism]] and [[human rights abuses]], as well as mental disorders like [[schizophrenia]] and [[paranoid]] on primetime. The show became one of Philippine television's most frequent social media-trending shows online, and became the highest-rated Filipino show for an early primetime television slot to date in the 21st century, becoming the first show to do so since the 1999 series finale of the original version of ''Mula Sa Puso''. Despite its finale in 2018, ''Wildflower'' is still shown to over 40 countries across Africa and Asia to date, reaching an audience of nearly 300 million viewers in all.\n\n2010s also marked the renewed popularity of long-term afternoon dramas on Philippine television after a temporary decline in the late 1990s. From 2014 to 2016, GMA broadcast ''[[The Half Sisters]]'' which starred teen actresses [[Barbie Forteza]] and [[Thea Tolentino]]. Also noted for the performances of veteran actors [[Jomari Yllana]] and [[Jean Garcia]], the show became the network's most successful teleserye in and out of the Philippines since the 2013 final episode of ''My Husband's Lover''. GMA would soon dominate the late afternoon timeslots between 2016 and 2018 with its adult, infidelity-themed teleserye ''[[Ika-6 na Utos]]'', which marks the television comeback of [[Sunshine Dizon]] and [[Gabby Concepcion]], and starred both [[Ryza Cenon]] and [[Angelika dela Cruz]] as sisters and antagonists of the show.\n\nTo pit against GMA on daytime, Julia Montes topbilled the ABS-CBN hit afternoon teleserye ''[[Doble Kara]]'', which ran between 2015 and 2017. The show was moved in early 2016 to the 3:20 PM time slot after its noontime show ''[[It's Showtime (variety show)|It's Showtime]]'' extended their time occupation then it competed the remake of ''[[Sinungaling Mong Puso]]'' in its rival GMA Network. Due to its continuous high ratings, it was extended and became the network's first teleserye to air for more than a year since the 2014 final episode of ''Be Careful With My Heart''. Its leadout teleserye ''[[Tubig at Langis]]'', airing in 2016, earned nationwide popularity because of the intense rivalry of lead actresses [[Cristine Reyes]] and [[Isabelle Daza]] as Irene and Clara, respectively. The network would soon overtake GMA in the afternoon timeslots with the rise of its 2018 series ''[[Kadenang Ginto]]''. The show features the rivaling tandems of [[Dimples Romana]] and [[Beauty Gonzalez]], and the up-and-coming teen duo [[Andrea Brillantes]] and [[Francine Diaz]], and is the country's first TV drama with an all-female prime lead cast group. The show also marked the television comebacks of leading men [[Albert Martinez]], [[Luis Alandy]] and [[Richard Yap]].\n\nDuring the same decade, the live format for teleserye final episodes returned on Philippine television for the first time since the finale of GMA's 2007 Philippine remake of ''Marimar''. ABS-CBN earned national attention in 2016 alone for concluding the runs of short-lived but otherwise popular teen-oriented primetime shows ''[[On the Wings of Love (TV series)|On the Wings of Love]]'' and ''[[Born for You]]''. ''On the Wings of Love'' was the first primetime show starring newcomer tandem [[James Reid (entertainer)|James Reid]] and [[Nadine Lustre]], while ''Born for You'' became the first musical-themed teleserye on Philippine television since the end of ABS-CBN's 2006 television adaptation of ''Bituing Walang Ningning'', and marked the primetime debut of [[Janella Salvador]] (after starring in ''Be Careful With My Heart'') and network newcomer [[Elmo Magalona]].\n\nThe 2008 hit series ''Lobo'' produced 2 more sequels ''[[Imortal]]'' in 2010 and ''[[La Luna Sangre]]'' in 2017, with all three shows airing on ABS-CBN and starred by Angel Locsin. While ''Imortal'' previously starred [[John Lloyd Cruz]], ''La Luna Sangre'' was the first primetime project of Daniel Padilla and Kathryn Bernardo since the 2016 series finale of the ''Pangako Sa'Yo'' remake, as well as the first major project on ABS-CBN by [[Richard Gutierrez]] after his tenure on GMA Network and TV5. It was also the first project of Locsin and Gutierrez as a tandem since their popularity on ''Mulawin'' on GMA in the mid-2000s. Also, 2018's ''[[Halik (TV series)|Halik]]'', also by ABS-CBN, marked the television comeback of [[Jericho Rosales]] and featured the rise to prominence of actresses [[Yen Santos]] and [[Yam Concepcion]], with the show continuing the trend of controversial dramas on adultery and infidelity of married couples on primetime. The show was soon replaced in 2019 in the timeslot by ''[[The Killer Bride]]''. The ongoing gothic romance-thriller show, which marked the first ever collaboration of real-life relatives [[Maja Salvador]] and [[Janella Salvador]], is widely praised for its script having perceived commentaries on the country's contemporary issues in the current [[Presidency of Rodrigo Duterte|Duterte administration]].<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.interaksyon.com/trends-spotlights/2019/10/01/155708/why-some-clips-abs-cbn-primetime-show-the-killer-bride-viral/amp/|title=Some clips of ABS-CBN primetime show \u2018The Killer Bride\u2019 are going viral.

The show also marked the television comebacks of [[Eula Valdez]], [[Janice de Belen]], [[Tirso Cruz III]], [[Paulo Avelino]] and [[JC de Vera]], and by mid-2019, firmly established the first ever all-adult-themed Philippine primetime television lineup (with Martin's police-themed ''Ang Probinsyano'', ''The General's Daughter'' and Salvador's ''The Killer Bride''), marking a huge shift from the once predominantly family-drama-driven primetime television network schedules in the country.\n\n===2020s===\n\nThe year [[2020 in Philippine television|2020]] was defined early on by [[Impact of the 2019\u201320 coronavirus pandemic on television|indefinite suspension of teleserye productions]] as a result of the [[2019-20 coronavirus pandemic|ongoing coronavirus pandemic]], affecting long-running teleseryes such as ''[[Ang Probinsyano]]'', which became the longest-running teleserye to span at least 2 separate decades in the 21st-century Philippine television.\n\n==Impact of teleseryes==\nThe range of popularity of Philippine drama since the early 2000s had spun overseas, becoming popular throughout [[Asia]] and [[Africa]], and has appealed widely to overseas Filipino communities in [[North America]] as well. Teleseryes have since evolved distinctly from most of the world's telenovelas throughout decades and highlight the country's position among the world's most successful television drama producers. Several of the Philippine teleseryes had emerged as among the most watched television programs in even difficult and huge non-Anglophonic markets such as [[Indonesia]], [[Malaysia]] and [[China]]. Considered one of the country's most vital economic and cultural exports, they are often dubbed into local languages, and sometimes has English and other foreign subtitles displayed when imported into those markets.\n\nABS-CBN and GMA are among the pioneering television producers in Asia to have exported their classical dramas, several of which reflect the reality of Filipino (and other similar Asian) societies, and have a universal message. ''Pangako Sa 'Yo'' is Philippines' all-time most successful TV series globally. Prior to topping the national television ratings in China in the mid-2000s, the story gained wide popularity to more than 1 billion viewers alone in Southeast Asia and Africa. ABS-CBN also introduced a website called ABS-CBN International Sales,<ref>[http://www.abs-cbnglobal.com/InternationalSales/tabid/247/Default.aspx abs-cbnglobal.com]</ref> for easy access to their shows. Other ABS-CBN shows like ''[[Sana Maulit Muli]]'' ([[Taiwan]]), ''[[Lobo (TV series)|Lobo]]'' (dubbed as ''She-Wolf: The Last Sentinel''), ''[[Tayong Dalawa]]'', ''[[Dahil May Isang Ikaw]]'', ''[[Kahit Isang Saglit]]'', ''[[Katorse]]'', the 2010 version of ''[[Mara Clara (2010 TV series)|Mara Clara]]'' (remake), ''[[Magkaribal]]'', ''[[Be Careful With My Heart]]'' ([[Vietnam]]) and ''Walang Hanggan'' were also exported. These were followed by simultaneous broadcasts of shows such as ''[[Ina, Kapatid, Anak (TV series)|Ina, Kapatid, Anak]]'', [[May Bukas Pa (2009 TV series)|''May'' ''Bukas'' ''Pa'']], ''[[Forevermore (TV series)|Forevermore]]'', ''[[Till I Met You (TV series)|Till I Met You]]'', ''[[Wildflower (TV series)|Wildflower]]'' and the currently airing television adaptation of ''Ang Probinsyano'' at around the same time in the Philippines and overseas by the mid-2010s as a result of their popularity in and out of the country.\n\nGMA Network still holds the record for the highest-rated pilot episodes with both ''Darna'' and ''Encantadia'' in 2005, and firmly established [[fantaserye]] as one of the most viable genres on Philippine primetime television. The network followed suit through the trend of Asianovelas this century with ''Boys Next Door'', a teen melodrama, which was the first Philippine television series aired in [[South Korea]] (which is considered one of the top rival exporters of television series in Asia). The 2007 Philippine adaptation of ''[[Marimar (2007 TV series)|MariMar]]'' became GMA's all-time most successful television series in and out of the Philippines, and was aired to wide popularity in Thailand, Malaysia, China, Singapore, Indonesia, Cambodia, Vietnam, Uganda, Tanzania, Kenya and [[Hawaii]]. Other GMA shows such as ''[[Habang Kapiling Ka]]'', ''[[Kahit Kailan]]'', ''[[Bakekang]]'', ''[[Muli (TV series)|Muli]]'', ''[[Impostora]]'', ''[[Mga Mata ni Anghelita]]'', ''[[Dyesebel (TV series)|Dyesebel]]'' and ''[[Encantadia (2016 TV series)|Encantadia]]'' are still broadcast in some countries in Asia and Africa.\n\nIn recent years, Philippine television drama has gained international recognition from international award-giving bodies, cementing the reputation of the Philippines among the world's most prolific television drama producers. Most of these nominated dramas were from ABS-CBN. It started with ''[[Lobo (TV series)|Lobo]]'', winning the Best Telenovela category in the 30th BANFF World Television Festival. Several dramas were also nominated in the [[International Emmy]] for the [[telenovela]] category, including ABS-CBN's ''Kay Tagal Kang Hinintay'', ''Dahil May Isang Ikaw'', ''[[Kahit Isang Saglit]]'', ''Bridges of Love'' and GMA's ''[[Magdusa Ka]]'' and ''[[My Husband's Lover]]''. ''[[Be Careful With My Heart]]'' of ABS-CBN was recently nominated in the 2013 New York Festivals TV and Film Awards. [[Angel Locsin]], [[Sid Lucero]] and [[Jodi Santamaria|Jodi Sta. Maria]] are, to date, the only Filipinos to be nominated at the International Emmys for Best Actor and Best Actress in a Drama Series for their respective leading TV program roles in the 2009 series ''Lobo'', 2010 series ''Dahil May Isang Ikaw'' and the 2015-2016 remake of ''Pangako Sa 'Yo''.\n\n==See also==\n* [[Television in the Philippines]]\n* [[List of Philippine television shows]]\n* [[List of Philippine drama series]]\n* [[List of ABS-CBN drama series]]\n* [[List of programs aired by 5 (TV channel)]]\n* [[List of GMA Network drama series]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n{{Dramatic television series}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Philippine Drama}}\n[[Category:Philippine culture]]\n[[Category:Television in the Philippines| ]]\n[[Category:Soap operas by genre]]\n[[Category:Television drama]]\n", "text_old": "{{multiple issues|\n{{more citations needed|date=March 2010}}\n{{Overly detailed|date=April 2011}}\n}}\n'''Philippine television drama''', also known as ''teleserye'', [[Philippines|Filipino]] [[telenovela]]s or P-drama, is a form of melodramatic serialized fiction in television in the Philippines. Teleserye is derived from two [[Filipino language|Filipino]] words: \"tele\", which is short for \"''telebisy\u00f3n''\" (television) and \"''s\u00e9rye''\" (series).\n\nTeleseryes share some characteristics and have similar roots with classic soap operas and ''telenovelas'', yet the teleserye has evolved into a genre with its own unique characteristics, often working as a social realist reflection of Filipino reality. Teleseryes are aired in prime-time,  afternoon, five days a week. They attract a broad audience crossing age and gender lines, and command the highest advertising rates in the Philippine television industry. The series last anywhere from three months to a year, or even longer, depending on their rating.\n\nOther forms of Philippine dramas include \"serials\" and \"anthologies\", which are usually shown on a weekly basis. These dramas are also intended to air a finite number of episodes usually lasting one season depending on the ratings.\n\n==History==\n\n===1950s-1980s===\nSoap operas in the Philippines originated when ''[[Gulong ng Palad]]'' (Wheel of Fortune) was first heard on the radio in 1949. The genre then expanded into television in the early 1960s. The first Philippine TV soap opera was ''[[Hiwaga sa Bahay na Bato]]'' (Mystery at the Stone House) in 1963, and was produced by [[ABS-CBN]]. ''Larawan ng Pag-ibig'' (Picture of Love), ''Prinsipe Amante'' (Prince Amante), and many others soon followed.<ref>[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8kokyGX5B_M 60 Years of Philippine Soap Operas]</ref>\n\n''[[Gulong ng Palad]]'', co-written by revival writer Loida Virina, was the longest-running radio serial that spanned for two decades until the mid 80s. It was made into a television soap opera starring [[Marianne Dela Riva]] and [[Ronald Corveau]], created stars out of many young actors like [[Romnick Sarmenta]] and starred veteran actress [[Caridad Sanchez]] whose popularity helped sustain the soap's lifetime.\n\nDuring the [[Martial law in the Philippines|martial law period]] from 1972 to 1986, the government closed several networks, including [[ABS-CBN]], leaving [[Radio Philippines Network|RPN-9]] and [[GMA Network|GMA]] as the only two commercial television networks in the country, but the lack of multi-network media base also aided the emergence of nationwide satellite broadcasting, spurring a dramatic growth of afternoon and primetime sitcoms and serials as a result of the fierce competition between the two networks. During this time, Philippine TV schedules resemble those in the U.S., with networks scheduling different shows per timeblock daily, in contrast with the country's modern weekday setup among its teleseryes, and separate weekend programming.\n\nRPN-9 produced ''[[Maria Flordeluna|Flordeluna]]'', starring award-winning actress [[Janice de Belen]]. The cast also included \"Drama King\" Dindo Fernando and award-winning actress and director [[Laurice Guillen]]. At the same time, GMA produced the hit tale ''[[Anna Liza]]'' starring child actress and FAMAS awardee [[Julie Vega]]. Prior to the formal introduction of [[AGB Nielsen Philippines|TV ratings system]] in the Philippines in the 1990s, both shows epitomized one of the biggest rivalries in Philippine showbiz history between Vega and de Belen (despite being highlighted as bestfriends offscreen). However, ''Anna Liza'' was cancelled in 1985 due to Julie Vega's death and as a result, the series had an unfinished storyline and a two-hour special in 1986, which was supposedly its final year on air. Both series were controversial from the start due to the rivalry between the fanbases of the two lead young actresses.\n\n===1990s===\nUntil the late 1980s, Philippine television dramas were broadcast in afternoon timeblocks. ABS-CBN resumed operations after the expulsion of the [[Ferdinand Marcos|Marcos dictatorship]] in 1986 and regained its lead among rival networks in audience ratings by the end of the decade. In the early and around the mid-1990s, local sitcoms dominated Philippine television, with the rise of ABS-CBN's ''[[Palibhasa Lalake]]'' and political satire ''[[Abangan Ang Susunod Na Kabanata]]'', and GMA Network's ''[[Bubble Gang]]''. The same decade, however, saw a new wave of international television phenomenon sweeping the Philippines, starting with the '[[telenovela|telenovela craze]]' over ABS-CBN's imported Mexican dramas.\n\nThe most popular were the ''Las Tres Marias'' Trilogy produced by the world-leading [[Televisa]] and starred by [[Thal\u00eda]] (starting with ''[[Maria Mercedes (telenovela)|Maria Mercedes]]'' shown on ABS-CBN and ''[[Marimar (Mexican telenovela)|Marimar]]'' and later, ''[[Maria la del Barrio]]'', shown on RPN-9, both as primetime shows). By this time, major networks began to reschedule locally made telenovelas into primetime slots to encourage more Filipino audiences to watch at night and for advertisers to invest more on these shows. By the mid-1990s, teleseryes surpassed sitcoms (both in number of shows produced and in nationwide audience ratings) as the most dominant form of primetime television in the Philippines.\n\nOne of the country's most well-known TV shows is ABS-CBN's pioneering network-grown drama ''[[Mara Clara]]'', which run from 1992 to 1997, gaining nationwide popularity due to the intense rivalry between its two stars and characters - [[Judy Ann Santos]] as the protagonist Mara and [[Gladys Reyes]] as the evil antagonist Clara. The series still stands as the longest-running teleserye in the post-Martial Law era of Philippine television, experiencing frequent timeslot changes before settling into the standard 7:00 P.M.-8:00 P.M. primetime block by late 1995 head-to-head with the ongoing re-airing of ''Marimar'' on RPN-9. ''Mara Clara'' is also credited for being the country's first successful teleserye to spawn a similarly successful movie under the same name. Santos' career would peak between 1997 and 1999 with her ABS-CBN series ''[[Esperanza (Philippine TV series)|Esperanza]]'', which also had a separate film made after its finale. A 1997 ''Esperanza'' episode currently holds the record for the [[List of most watched television broadcasts|all-time highest rated single episode]] for any Philippine television series.\n\nIn mid-1997, another ABS-CBN series, ''[[Mula sa Puso]]'', marked the rise of [[Claudine Barretto]] as one of the country's most prominent actresses, where she played the heiress Via in the 2-year-long soap, together with the late [[Rico Yan]] and [[Diether Ocampo]] as her leading men, and [[Princess Punzalan]] as Selina, the most influential character of the series. The show also marked a shift in the Philippine television market by the late 1990s, as ''Mula Sa Puso'' became known for being the country's first middle-class primetime series - a huge break from the preceding Filipino telenovelas with mass-appealing protagonists from the lower socio-economic classes.\n\nPunzalan's antagonist performance is highly regarded among the best on Philippine television and is still widely touted as the basis for all of the succeeding teleserye villains, and the rivalry between her character and [[Jacklyn Jose]]'s (as Via's mother Magda) became a standard for confrontation scenes of TV series in the succeeding decades on Philippine television. Simultaneously running with ''Esperanza'', both programs pioneered crossover episodes among Philippine teleserye during the same period, and ''Mula sa Puso'' spawned another successful movie after its finale in 1999. Both shows also helped ABS-CBN dominate as the country's leading television network by the late 1990s for more than 10 straight years running, ranking competitively as Philippines' 2 most watched overall TV series in every year on air.\n\nMeanwhile, rival network's GMA retained and even popularized their afternoon serialized dramas form such as ''[[Villa Quintana]]'' with lead stars [[Donna Cruz]] as Lynette Quintana and [[Keempee de Leon]] as Isagani Samonte with [[Isabel Rivas]] as Stella Quintana which airs from 1995 to 1997. This was followed by ''[[Ikaw Na Sana]]'' with lead characters [[Angelu de Leon]] as Blanca Rosales Perez / Susan Saavedra and [[Bobby Andrews]] as Rafael Huico with Gladys Reyes as Angela Rosales which airs between 1997 and 1998, and a film was made after this show. At the peak of both these GMA afternoon shows' fame, they were moved to primetime slots by the end of the 1990s to compete with ABS-CBN's rise on national television with their primetime serials, a foreshadow of what would eventually be the touted primetime television series blocks for both rival networks.\n\n===2000s===\nModern Philippine television dramas have begun to evolve to today's modern form called ''teleserye'', a portmanteau of the Filipino words \"telebisyon\" (\"television\") and \"serye\" (\"series\"). The term originated from the ABS-CBN hit drama ''[[Pangako Sa 'Yo]]'', airing from 2000 to 2002 and starring [[Jericho Rosales]] and [[Kristine Hermosa]], and the iconic rivalry between actresses [[Eula Valdez]] as the original Amor de Jesus-Powers and [[Jean Garcia]] as the original Claudia Buenavista. The tandem of Valdez and Garcia in the original ''Pangako Sa'Yo'' is widely regarded as the most successful rivalry of main characters in all of Philippine television, setting the standards for future teleserye ensemble casts.\n\n''Pangako Sa'Yo'' is dubbed as the country's first ever teleserye and was considered one of the most significant turning points in Philippine television history due to its pioneering cinematic production and modified fast-paced, multiple-arc story structure distinguishing it from previous Filipino telenovelas. It was broadcast internationally in many networks across the Americas, Africa and Asia, and remains the most successful Philippine television series internationally. At the end of its run in 2002, ''Pangako Sa 'Yo'' remains as the record-holder of the [[List of most watched television broadcasts|all-time highest rated series finale episode]] for any locally made program in Philippine television history, and firmly established the current primetime block of ABS-CBN.\n\n''Pangako Sa 'Yo'' effectively became the highest rated teleserye by average, both domestically and internationally, in all of Philippine television history, and inspired ABS-CBN to produce (in mid-2002) its leadout teleserye, ''[[Kay Tagal Kang Hinintay]]''. Already concluded in 2003, the show introduced the highly acclaimed tandem of [[John Lloyd Cruz]] and [[Bea Alonzo]] as one of the country's most successful long-established television and film loveteams until today. Also known for the iconic performance of [[Lorna Tolentino]] as the protagonist twins Lorrea and Lorrinda Guinto, it became the nation's first ever local television series to become a finalist to the Best Drama Series category of the [[International Academy of Television Arts and Sciences|International Emmy Awards]] in 2003, marking the rise of the Philippines on the world television programming stage.\n\nRosales and Hermosa, along with [[Diether Ocampo]] and [[Angelika dela Cruz]], would altogether star in another teleserye classic, ''[[Sana'y Wala Nang Wakas]]''. Airing between 2003 and 2004, ''Sana'y Wala Nang Wakas'' became the world's first ever drama series allowing its viewers to choose the story's ending through text messaging. Another groundbreaking teleserye of ABS-CBN was ''[[Basta't Kasama Kita]]'', airing around the same period as of ''Sana'y Wala Nang Wakas''. Starring Judy Ann Santos and [[Robin Padilla]], the show was notable for its depiction of the country's [[National Bureau of Investigation (Philippines)|National Bureau of Investigation]] and for being the country's first ever local television series to broadcast a [[live television|live]] series finale episode in 2004. This introduced the live format of series finales among fictional series on Philippine television - a feat only few teleseryes had accomplished until today. Both series followed ''Pangako Sa'Yo'' to be broadcast abroad, marking the rise of Philippines to international prominence in television drama production.\n\nABS-CBN's fortunes would soon increase with its 1999-2001 series ''[[Saan Ka Man Naroroon]]'' starring [[Claudine Barretto]] on lead role as triplets Rosemarie, Rosenda and Rosario. The show was critically acclaimed and became one of the few groundbreaking shows of the 2000s in the Philippines starring a female lead character, as well as the country's first teleserye with at least two characters portrayed simultaneously by one actor.\n\nBarretto would consequently gain prominence for her lead role on ''[[Sa Dulo Ng Walang Hanggan]]'' a timeless love story of the undying love of Angeline Crisostomo/Angelina whose mistakes that appear in the present had also happened in the past; it uncovered the lies and the love of all around her which was actually reincarnated into the present. She was also the lead star of the popular teleserye ''[[Marina (Philippine TV series)|Marina]]''. Airing in 2004, the show popularized the [[Fantaserye and telefantasya|fantasy]] theme throughout most of the incoming teleseryes in the Philippines, becoming the first original fantasy series made for television to score success on Philippine primetime television ratings.\n\nThe Philippines began emerging as one of the world's largest television drama-producing nations in the mid-2000s. Several of its international hits include the 2006 remake of ''[[Gulong ng Palad]]'' on ABS-CBN, with its cast including [[Kristine Hermosa]] as Luisa, [[TJ Trinidad]] as Carding and [[Cherie Gil]] as Philiomena \"Menang\" Medel, the corrupt town mayor and also the main antagonist of the series. The role of Mimi was given to [[Andrea del Rosario]] and [[Rio Locsin]] as Caridad \"Idad\" Santos. The series was popular amongst international viewers, through [[The Filipino Channel|TFC]]. In 2007, the remake of ''[[Maria Flordeluna]]'', which previously aired on RPN-9 through most of the 1970s and 1980s, starred young actress [[Eliza Pineda]] as the titular character. It also starred [[Albert Martinez]] as Leo Alicante, [[Eula Valdez]] as Mary Jo Esperitu and [[John Estrada]] as Gary Alvarado. The series ran on ABS-CBN for 93 episodes and won the PMPC Star Awards Best Television Series in 2008, and popularized the trend of remaking classic child-starred Philippine telenovelas of the past.\n\nTo pit against its rival network, GMA Network started producing their own set of primetime soap opera starting with the top-rating drama series, ''[[Ikaw Lang Ang Mamahalin]]'' starring drama actress [[Angelika dela Cruz]] which aired from 2001 to 2002 and ''[[Sana Ay Ikaw Na Nga]]'' starring [[Dingdong Dantes]].  It was successfully shown in Malaysia and other Asian countries. Another was the political drama, ''[[Kung Mawawala Ka]]'' also became one of the most loved powerful dramas which revolved on politics and even on issues of corruption. Starring [[Eddie Garcia]] as the show's main character (and lead antagonist), it also showed the dramatic abilities of actresses [[Hilda Koronel]], Liza Lorena and [[Gloria Diaz]] as the powerful wives. The series ran between 2001 and 2002 and also won a PMPC Award from the Philippine Movie Press Club. It was also the most popular GMA-made drama (as well as the most successful single telenovela) pitted against the ongoing television drama ''Pangako Sa 'Yo'' which also reached its end in 2002.\n\nIt was not until 2004, however, when GMA Network overtook ABS-CBN in the national ratings when the former introduced an all-fantaserye (a portmanteau of \"fantasy\" and teleserye, i.e. fantasy-themed teleseryes) primetime slate by 2005, through the successful broadcasts of female-lead shows such as ''[[Encantadia]]'', which originally starred [[Iza Calzado]], [[Karylle]], [[Sunshine Dizon]] and [[Diana Zubiri]], and ''[[Mulawin]]'', starring the successful tandem of [[Angel Locsin]] and [[Richard Gutierrez]]. GMA earned ratings foothold against its main rival ABS-CBN during this time when it brought life to ''[[Darna (2005 TV series)|Darna]]'', a role reprised by the most famous Darna of all time, [[Vilma Santos]] (in the late 1970s and early 1980s), and starring [[Angel Locsin]] in its first television remake, and ushered the era of film-turned-TV remakes on Philippine television.\n\nProminent film-turned-TV remakes in the Philippines in the 2000s include ''[[Panday (2005 TV series)|Panday]]'' which starred [[Jericho Rosales]] and [[Heart Evangelista]], and the remake of ''[[Mga Anghel na Walang Langit]]'' and ''[[Kampanerang Kuba]]'' which starred [[Anne Curtis]], all made by ABS-CBN. The \"''sineserye''\" genre was introduced on Philippine television in this decade through ''[[Bituing Walang Ningning]]'' which starred [[Sarah Geronimo]] and [[Angelika de la Cruz]], reprising the iconic roles of [[Sharon Cuneta]] and [[Cherie Gil]] won prominence and also produced a concert. It also came to be known as having \"The Grand Finale\" as this introduced the format of series finale stretched to 5 days on the final week on Philippine television. ''Bituing Walang Ningning'' remains the all-time highest rated regular musical television drama series in the Philippines.\n\nBy the late 2000s, GMA-7 and ABS-CBN would soon embark on one of the country's most heated rivalries for the most watched television network. GMA aired its 2007 remake of the international telenovela ''[[Marimar (2007 TV series)|MariMar]]'' which starred [[Marian Rivera]] and [[Dingdong Dantes]] (then remade in 2015 for a second time with [[Marimar (2015 TV series)|the same title]] starring [[Megan Young]] and [[Tom Rodriguez]]). The remake, highlighted as one of the world's most successful international remakes of any former Latinovela, boosted GMA's short-term dominance as the most watched television network in the country during the year. Meanwhile, during the second half of the 2000s, three ABS-CBN-made TV series became popular: the remake of the 1977\u20131985 soap opera ''[[Gulong ng Palad]]'', the teleserye ''[[Sa Piling Mo]]'' and the series ''[[Maging Sino Ka Man]]''. The latter became the most popular teleserye internationally after ''Pangako Sa'Yo'' and boosted the careers of [[John Lloyd Cruz]], [[Bea Alonzo]], [[Sam Milby]] and [[Anne Curtis]].\n\nOn the year 2008, ABS-CBN produced its most expensive series ''[[Lobo (TV series)|Lobo]]'', about two opposing groups in the story\u2014the Luna and the Waya. The show starred [[Piolo Pascual]] and [[Angel Locsin]], in the latter's first major project on ABS-CBN after transferring from GMA Network in one of Philippine television's most controversial network switches by any actor to date. Locsin's performance was the first from any Filipino to be nominated to the [[International Emmy Award for Best Actress|International Emmys]] for a leading role. The members of the Luna organization have a grudge against the werewolves while the Waya are the protectors of the Lobo (the werewolves), and they want them to co-exist harmoniously with normal humans.\n\nThe year 2008 also marked the international success of the [[I Love Betty La Fea|Philippine remake]] of the world-hit Colombian original telenovela ''[[Yo soy Betty, la fea]]''. Starring Bea Alonzo, it became the most successful Philippine remake of any Latinovela since the 2007 Marimar remake starring Marian Rivera on GMA Network. Alonzo's portrayal gained widespread prominence through most of Asia on her titular character, and was vital in ABS-CBN's defeat of GMA as the country's most watched television network at the end of the decade.\n\n===2010s===\n\nBy the 2010s, ABS-CBN and GMA Network would rival in their claims as the most watched network in the Philippines. While GMA Network appeals to most of the viewers in [[Mega Manila]] (through their shows that are said to be [[Imperial Manila|Manila-centric]] in setting) beginning the mid-2000s, most primetime shows from ABS-CBN appeal widely to other regions in the country, particularly in the sought-after audiences of [[Visayas]] and [[Mindanao]]. Local media experts attribute this trend to ABS-CBN's return to original Filipino programming.\n\nABS-CBN's ratings success since the late 2000s was initiated by the success of the 2009 teleserye ''[[May Bukas Pa]]''. Starring [[Zaijian Jaranilla]] as the iconic Santino, the show became the first successful religious-themed series on Philippine television, as well as the most successful child-starred Philippine television series since the 1985 demise of the original ''Anna Liza'' of Julie Vega on GMA Network. ''May Bukas Pa'' also became the first Philippine primetime television series to have lasted at least one full year (since ''Sa Dulo ng Walang Hanggan'' in 2001-2003), ending in 2010 as the country's all-time most watched TV show since Philippine television [[Kantar Media|switched to nationwide TV ratings system]].\n\n2010 featured some of Philippine television's strongest original teleseryes such as ''[[Dahil May Isang Ikaw]]'', which became the comeback project of the tandem of Kristine Hermosa and Jericho Rosales, and revitalized the careers of veteran actors such as [[Lorna Tolentino]], [[John Estrada]], [[Chin Chin Gutierrez]] and [[Gabby Concepcion]]. The show, which aired on ABS-CBN, was the first primetime project of GMA Network transferees [[Karylle]] and [[Sid Lucero]], the latter of whom remains the only Filipino male to be nominated at the [[International Emmy Awards]] for a leading role in any TV series. This was followed up by the fantaserye ''[[Agua Bendita]]'', which was the first primetime show with titular characters starred by [[Xyriel Manabat]] and [[Andi Eigenmann]] in its earlier and latter stages, marking the trend for child-starred original Filipino programming. Manabat would soon star in ABS-CBN's critical hit ''[[100 Days to Heaven]]'', which also marked the primetime return of actresses [[Coney Reyes]] and [[Jodi Santamaria|Jodi Sta. Maria]].\n\nBeginning 2011, however, the mass transfer of some actors and actresses between ABS-CBN and GMA became a common trend on Philippine television. Moreover, both networks' hold on primetime television programming in the country would soon be challenged by [[TV5 (Philippines)|TV5]] with its debut teleserye offering in ''[[Babaeng Hampaslupa]]'', which starred with [[Alex Gonzaga]], [[Alice Dixson]] and [[Susan Roces]]. To date, its most recent offering was the 2016 series ''[[Bakit Manipis ang Ulap?]]'' (produced by [[Viva Entertainment]], based on the 1985 film of the same title created by Danny Zialcita) with [[Diether Ocampo]], [[Claudine Barretto]], [[Cesar Montano]] and [[Meg Imperial]].\n\n2010s also marked the start of broadcast of teleseryes induced with storylines known to have reflected some of the controversial issues facing the Philippines nowadays. For instance, Julia Montes and newcomer [[Coco Martin]] starred in the 2012 ABS-CBN hit ''[[Walang Hanggan (TV series)|Walang Hanggan]]''. Known for tackling issues on [[adultery]] and [[infidelity]] among Filipino households, the romantic drama featured the primetime return of veteran actors [[Richard Gomez]] and [[Dawn Zulueta]], and also gained wide popularity in most of Southeast Asia during its run, becoming the first Philippine television series to win in its ratings timeslot in all of its episodes. The show is also the country's second all-time highest-rated TV show since its final episode in 2012, and marked Martin's successful transition from the [[independent film|Filipino indie scene]] to become the foremost actor of the current era of Philippine television.\n\nAnother popular ABS-CBN teleserye was the 2012-2013 series ''[[Ina, Kapatid, Anak (TV series)|Ina, Kapatid, Anak]]''. Known for the heated on-and-offscreen rivalry of both actresses [[Kim Chiu]] and [[Maja Salvador]] during its run, as well as the primetime comeback of veteran actresses [[Cherry Pie Picache]] and Janice de Belen, the show gained national prominence for its open discussion of [[surrogacy|mother surrogacy]] - a topic previously but highly prohibited on Philippine media - and using the [[University of the Philippines Diliman|University of the Philippines]] (the country's national university) as its main setting.\n\nSalvador would later team up with Angel Locsin in the highly acclaimed 2014 series ''[[The Legal Wife]]'' in the same network. The show, which also talked about infidelity and adultery, marked the Jericho Rosales's first work with Salvador and Locsin, and the first ABS-CBN primetime show by GMA Network transferee [[JC de Vera]], was known for its controversial open-ended series finale among Locsin, Salvador and Rosales' characters, and for ranking to date as the country's most watched TV show nationwide for a late primetime slot. The family-oriented ABS-CBN daytime romantic drama ''[[Be Careful With My Heart]]'' (aired by ABS-CBN) introduced the highly successful tandem of [[Jodi Santamaria|Jodi Sta. Maria]] and [[Richard Yap]], and became the first teleserye to exceed 2 years in its overall run (from July 9, 2012 until November 28, 2014 with a total of 622 episodes). The show has since become the most successful Philippine television series on daytime block in and out of the Philippines.\n\n2013 also marked the television comeback of [[Judy Ann Santos]] through the ABS-CBN revenge thriller drama ''[[Huwag Ka Lang Mawawala]]'', which also starred [[Sam Milby]] and [[KC Concepcion]] (in both of their debut antagonist roles). The short-lived series, however, was notable for its depiction of [[women's empowerment]] in the Philippine context, as well as infidelity, and would peak in the ratings after it was transferred to the late primetime slot, eventually emerging as the country's second highest-rated TV show of all time in that timeblock. The show marked one of the very few times a Filipino TV program was transferred to a much latter airing time and attract more viewers leading up to any series finale.\n\nGMA Network, however, scored a major milestone by being the country's most expersive and first historical drama series ''[[Amaya (TV series)|Amaya]]'', starting [[Marian Rivera]] as a title role with [[Sid Lucero]], who transfer to the network after leaving ABS-CBN and newcomer [[Mikael Daez]]. It becomes the most highest ratings of all time including the finale episode. It was also Rivera's breakthrough role since Marimar. Also that year, Rivera gained another fame through the Philippine adaptation of a popular Korean series, ''[[Temptation of Wife (2012 TV series)|Temptation Of Wife]]'' alongside with [[Dennis Trillo]],  [[Glaiza de Castro]] & formerly ABS-CBN star [[Rafael Rosell]]. It becomes the most watching ratings of the series, with de Castro character Heidi, was widspread accliam praised by critcs for her antagonist role and her character rival with Rivera's character. \n\nTrillo later appears on the first ever television network to air a [[homosexuality|gay-themed]] primetime series. In 2013, the short-lived but popular teleserye ''[[My Husband's Lover]]'', starring newcomer [[Tom Rodriguez]] and [[Carla Abellana]], emerged as a hot topic of national conversation due to their portrayal in the show, which discussed about [[homosexuality]] - a widespread but controversial topic given the country's longstanding [[Roman Catholic Church|Catholic]] values and teachings. It has also gained prominence for being a widely viewed show despite being pitted against the simultaneously running ''Ina, Kapatid, Anak'' that has also since become a hit in and out of the Philippines. GMA Network would soon gain its ratings momentum with its [[Encantadia (2016 TV series)|2016-2017 remake]] of its iconic fantaserye (portmanteau for \"fantasy-themed\" teleserye) ''[[Encantadia (2005 TV series)|Encantadia]]'', marking the continuity of the trend for revivals of 2000s teleseryes on Philippine television initially popularized by ABS-CBN.\n\nIn 2009, the series remake of AnnaLiza was shelved which was to star Maja Salvador and Jason Abalos, but finally revived again in 2013 (with child star Andrea Brillantes in the title role). Together with the earlier success of the 2007 remake of ''Maria Flordeluna'' and the 2010 remake of ''[[Mara Clara (2010 TV series)|Mara Clara]]'', which introduced mainstream actresses [[Julia Montes]] and [[Kathryn Bernardo]], ABS-CBN popularized the concept of revival of previously massive hit teenager-starred telenovelas of the previous decades on Philippine television. The 2010 remake of ''Mara Clara'' is regarded as the single most successful remake of any previous Filipino telenovela dating from the 20th century.\n\nThis would be followed up by the [[Pangako Sa 'Yo (2015 TV series)|2015 remake]] of ''Pangako Sa'Yo'' (still under ABS-CBN), starring the trio of Jodi Sta. Maria, [[Angelica Panganiban]] and [[Ian Veneracion]] as the new-generation characters Amor de Jesus-Powers, Claudia Buenavista and Eduardo Buenavista, respectively. Also known as the first major drama project of the widely popular tandem of [[Kathryn Bernardo]] and [[Daniel Padilla]] as the leads Yna Macaspac and Angelo Buenavista, respectively, the show, which ended in 2016, garnered mixed reviews but wide commercial success, making it the most successful remake of any 2000s Philippine teleserye to date. However, Sta. Maria, who portrayed the role of Lia Buenavista in the original ''Pangako Sa'Yo'' (and of which was portrayed by Brillantes in the remake), garnered rave reviews for her new-generation portrayal of Amor de Jesus-Powers (previously acted by Eula Valdez), and remains the most recent Asian actress to be nominated at the [[International Emmy Awards]] for a leading role as of {{CURRENT YEAR}}.\n\nMore teleseryes earned renewed international popularity by 2016, courtesy of ''[[Bridges of Love]]'' (that ran from March 16 to August 7, 2015 on ABS-CBN), starring Rosales, Salvador and [[Paulo Avelino]], under the title ''Puentes de Amor'', the first Philippine drama aired in Latin America, which began on April 25, 2016 on [[Panamericana Televisi\u00f3n]] in [[Peru]]. The same year, Martin starred in the currently running 2015 series ''[[Ang Probinsyano]]'', gaining national attention for its bold portrayal of the country's ongoing [[Philippine Drug War|anti-illegal drugs campaign]] and the [[Philippine National Police]] despite renewed nationwide television censors by the [[Movie and Television Review and Classification Board|MTRCB]].\n\nABS-CBN's recent announcement of the show's run extension until 2020 made ''Ang Probinsyano'' the longest-running overall teleserye to ever debut in the 21st century on Philippine television, which the show is slated to overtake the 1992-1997 original run of ''Mara Clara'' as the country's longest-running TV series since the [[People Power Revolution]] in 1986. The show is also the all-time most dominant show on Philippine television based on [[Kantar Media|TV ratings]], as it has occupied the [[AGB Nielsen Philippines|top spot]] non-stop every year since its inception in 2015.\n\nSalvador would soon star in the hit 2017-2018 series ''[[Wildflower (TV series)|Wildflower]]'' as the main characters Lily Cruz/Ivy Aguas. The show was notable for revitalizing the careers of veteran actors [[Tirso Cruz III]], [[Aiko Melendez]], [[Sunshine Cruz]], [[Christian Vasquez]] and [[Wendell Ramos]], for the primetime debuts of television newcomers [[Joseph Marco]], [[Vin Abrenica]], [[RK Bagatsing]], [[Yen Santos]] and [[Roxanne Barcelo]], and for being the first Philippine teleserye to portray controversial political topics such as [[nepotism]] and [[human rights abuses]], as well as mental disorders like [[schizophrenia]] and [[paranoid]] on primetime. The show became one of Philippine television's most frequent social media-trending shows online, and became the highest-rated Filipino show for an early primetime television slot to date in the 21st century, becoming the first show to do so since the 1999 series finale of the original version of ''Mula Sa Puso''. Despite its finale in 2018, ''Wildflower'' is still shown to over 40 countries across Africa and Asia to date, reaching an audience of nearly 300 million viewers in all.\n\n2010s also marked the renewed popularity of long-term afternoon dramas on Philippine television after a temporary decline in the late 1990s. From 2014 to 2016, GMA broadcast ''[[The Half Sisters]]'' which starred teen actresses [[Barbie Forteza]] and [[Thea Tolentino]]. Also noted for the performances of veteran actors [[Jomari Yllana]] and [[Jean Garcia]], the show became the network's most successful teleserye in and out of the Philippines since the 2013 final episode of ''My Husband's Lover''. GMA would soon dominate the late afternoon timeslots between 2016 and 2018 with its adult, infidelity-themed teleserye ''[[Ika-6 na Utos]]'', which marks the television comeback of [[Sunshine Dizon]] and [[Gabby Concepcion]], and starred both [[Ryza Cenon]] and [[Angelika dela Cruz]] as sisters and antagonists of the show.\n\nTo pit against GMA on daytime, Julia Montes topbilled the ABS-CBN hit afternoon teleserye ''[[Doble Kara]]'', which ran between 2015 and 2017. The show was moved in early 2016 to the 3:20 PM time slot after its noontime show ''[[It's Showtime (variety show)|It's Showtime]]'' extended their time occupation then it competed the remake of ''[[Sinungaling Mong Puso]]'' in its rival GMA Network. Due to its continuous high ratings, it was extended and became the network's first teleserye to air for more than a year since the 2014 final episode of ''Be Careful With My Heart''. Its leadout teleserye ''[[Tubig at Langis]]'', airing in 2016, earned nationwide popularity because of the intense rivalry of lead actresses [[Cristine Reyes]] and [[Isabelle Daza]] as Irene and Clara, respectively. The network would soon overtake GMA in the afternoon timeslots with the rise of its 2018 series ''[[Kadenang Ginto]]''. The show features the rivaling tandems of [[Dimples Romana]] and [[Beauty Gonzalez]], and the up-and-coming teen duo [[Andrea Brillantes]] and [[Francine Diaz]], and is the country's first TV drama with an all-female prime lead cast group. The show also marked the television comebacks of leading men [[Albert Martinez]], [[Luis Alandy]] and [[Richard Yap]].\n\nDuring the same decade, the live format for teleserye final episodes returned on Philippine television for the first time since the finale of GMA's 2007 Philippine remake of ''Marimar''. ABS-CBN earned national attention in 2016 alone for concluding the runs of short-lived but otherwise popular teen-oriented primetime shows ''[[On the Wings of Love (TV series)|On the Wings of Love]]'' and ''[[Born for You]]''. ''On the Wings of Love'' was the first primetime show starring newcomer tandem [[James Reid (entertainer)|James Reid]] and [[Nadine Lustre]], while ''Born for You'' became the first musical-themed teleserye on Philippine television since the end of ABS-CBN's 2006 television adaptation of ''Bituing Walang Ningning'', and marked the primetime debut of [[Janella Salvador]] (after starring in ''Be Careful With My Heart'') and network newcomer [[Elmo Magalona]].\n\nThe 2008 hit series ''Lobo'' produced 2 more sequels ''[[Imortal]]'' in 2010 and ''[[La Luna Sangre]]'' in 2017, with all three shows airing on ABS-CBN and starred by Angel Locsin. While ''Imortal'' previously starred [[John Lloyd Cruz]], ''La Luna Sangre'' was the first primetime project of Daniel Padilla and Kathryn Bernardo since the 2016 series finale of the ''Pangako Sa'Yo'' remake, as well as the first major project on ABS-CBN by [[Richard Gutierrez]] after his tenure on GMA Network and TV5. It was also the first project of Locsin and Gutierrez as a tandem since their popularity on ''Mulawin'' on GMA in the mid-2000s. Also, 2018's ''[[Halik (TV series)|Halik]]'', also by ABS-CBN, marked the television comeback of [[Jericho Rosales]] and featured the rise to prominence of actresses [[Yen Santos]] and [[Yam Concepcion]], with the show continuing the trend of controversial dramas on adultery and infidelity of married couples on primetime. The show was soon replaced in 2019 in the timeslot by ''[[The Killer Bride]]''. The ongoing gothic romance-thriller show, which marked the first ever collaboration of real-life relatives [[Maja Salvador]] and [[Janella Salvador]], is widely praised for its script having perceived commentaries on the country's contemporary issues in the current [[Presidency of Rodrigo Duterte|Duterte administration]].<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.interaksyon.com/trends-spotlights/2019/10/01/155708/why-some-clips-abs-cbn-primetime-show-the-killer-bride-viral/amp/|title=Some clips of ABS-CBN primetime show \u2018The Killer Bride\u2019 are going viral.

The show also marked the television comebacks of [[Eula Valdez]], [[Janice de Belen]], [[Tirso Cruz III]], [[Paulo Avelino]] and [[JC de Vera]], and by mid-2019, firmly established the first ever all-adult-themed Philippine primetime television lineup (with Martin's police-themed ''Ang Probinsyano'', ''The General's Daughter'' and Salvador's ''The Killer Bride''), marking a huge shift from the once predominantly family-drama-driven primetime television network schedules in the country.\n\n===2020s===\n\nThe year [[2020 in Philippine television|2020]] was defined early on by [[Impact of the 2019\u201320 coronavirus pandemic on television|indefinite suspension of teleserye productions]] as a result of the [[2019-20 coronavirus pandemic|ongoing coronavirus pandemic]], affecting long-running teleseryes such as ''[[Ang Probinsyano]]'', which became the longest-running teleserye to span at least 2 separate decades in the 21st-century Philippine television.\n\n==Impact of teleseryes==\nThe range of popularity of Philippine drama since the early 2000s had spun overseas, becoming popular throughout [[Asia]] and [[Africa]], and has appealed widely to overseas Filipino communities in [[North America]] as well. Teleseryes have since evolved distinctly from most of the world's telenovelas throughout decades and highlight the country's position among the world's most successful television drama producers. Several of the Philippine teleseryes had emerged as among the most watched television programs in even difficult and huge non-Anglophonic markets such as [[Indonesia]], [[Malaysia]] and [[China]]. Considered one of the country's most vital economic and cultural exports, they are often dubbed into local languages, and sometimes has English and other foreign subtitles displayed when imported into those markets.\n\nABS-CBN and GMA are among the pioneering television producers in Asia to have exported their classical dramas, several of which reflect the reality of Filipino (and other similar Asian) societies, and have a universal message. ''Pangako Sa 'Yo'' is Philippines' all-time most successful TV series globally. Prior to topping the national television ratings in China in the mid-2000s, the story gained wide popularity to more than 1 billion viewers alone in Southeast Asia and Africa. ABS-CBN also introduced a website called ABS-CBN International Sales,<ref>[http://www.abs-cbnglobal.com/InternationalSales/tabid/247/Default.aspx abs-cbnglobal.com]</ref> for easy access to their shows. Other ABS-CBN shows like ''[[Sana Maulit Muli]]'' ([[Taiwan]]), ''[[Lobo (TV series)|Lobo]]'' (dubbed as ''She-Wolf: The Last Sentinel''), ''[[Tayong Dalawa]]'', ''[[Dahil May Isang Ikaw]]'', ''[[Kahit Isang Saglit]]'', ''[[Katorse]]'', the 2010 version of ''[[Mara Clara (2010 TV series)|Mara Clara]]'' (remake), ''[[Magkaribal]]'', ''[[Be Careful With My Heart]]'' ([[Vietnam]]) and ''Walang Hanggan'' were also exported. These were followed by simultaneous broadcasts of shows such as ''[[Ina, Kapatid, Anak (TV series)|Ina, Kapatid, Anak]]'', [[May Bukas Pa (2009 TV series)|''May'' ''Bukas'' ''Pa'']], ''[[Forevermore (TV series)|Forevermore]]'', ''[[Till I Met You (TV series)|Till I Met You]]'', ''[[Wildflower (TV series)|Wildflower]]'' and the currently airing television adaptation of ''Ang Probinsyano'' at around the same time in the Philippines and overseas by the mid-2010s as a result of their popularity in and out of the country.\n\nGMA Network still holds the record for the highest-rated pilot episodes with both ''Darna'' and ''Encantadia'' in 2005, and firmly established [[fantaserye]] as one of the most viable genres on Philippine primetime television. The network followed suit through the trend of Asianovelas this century with ''Boys Next Door'', a teen melodrama, which was the first Philippine television series aired in [[South Korea]] (which is considered among one of the top rival exporters of television series in Asia). The 2007 Philippine adaptation of ''[[Marimar (2007 TV series)|MariMar]]'' became GMA's all-time most successful television series in and out of the Philippines, and was aired to wide popularity in Thailand, Malaysia, China, Singapore, Indonesia, Cambodia, Vietnam, Uganda, Tanzania, Kenya and [[Hawaii]]. Other GMA shows such as ''[[Habang Kapiling Ka]]'', ''[[Kahit Kailan]]'', ''[[Bakekang]]'', ''[[Muli (TV series)|Muli]]'', ''[[Impostora]]'', ''[[Mga Mata ni Anghelita]]'', ''[[Dyesebel (TV series)|Dyesebel]]'' and ''[[Encantadia (2016 TV series)|Encantadia]]'' are still broadcast in some countries in Asia and Africa.\n\nIn recent years, Philippine television drama has gained international recognition from international award-giving bodies, cementing the reputation of the Philippines among the world's most prolific television drama producers. Most of these nominated dramas were from ABS-CBN. It started with ''[[Lobo (TV series)|Lobo]]'', winning the Best Telenovela category in the 30th BANFF World Television Festival. Several dramas were also nominated in the [[International Emmy]] for the [[telenovela]] category, including ABS-CBN's ''Kay Tagal Kang Hinintay'', ''Dahil May Isang Ikaw'', ''[[Kahit Isang Saglit]]'', ''Bridges of Love'' and GMA's ''[[Magdusa Ka]]'' and ''[[My Husband's Lover]]''. ''[[Be Careful With My Heart]]'' of ABS-CBN was recently nominated in the 2013 New York Festivals TV and Film Awards. [[Angel Locsin]], [[Sid Lucero]] and [[Jodi Santamaria|Jodi Sta. Maria]] are, to date, the only Filipinos to be nominated at the International Emmys for Best Actor and Best Actress in a Drama Series for their respective leading TV program roles in the 2009 series ''Lobo'', 2010 series ''Dahil May Isang Ikaw'' and the 2015-2016 remake of ''Pangako Sa 'Yo''.\n\n==See also==\n* [[Television in the Philippines]]\n* [[List of Philippine television shows]]\n* [[List of Philippine drama series]]\n* [[List of ABS-CBN drama series]]\n* [[List of programs aired by 5 (TV channel)]]\n* [[List of GMA Network drama series]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n{{Dramatic television series}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Philippine Drama}}\n[[Category:Philippine culture]]\n[[Category:Television in the Philippines| ]]\n[[Category:Soap operas by genre]]\n[[Category:Television drama]]\n", "name_user": "Arjayay", "label": "safe", "comment": "Reword - you can't be \"among one\"", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philippine_television_drama"}

Although it won the 1964 [[Golden Globe]] award for Best Television Series, the show was cancelled after one season consisting of thirty episodes.\n\n==Production==\nNiven and Boyer were two of the owners of [[Four Star Television]], the show\u2019s production company. Although sometimes appearing together, the three leads tended to rotate appearances as their schedules permitted, which meant that Young helmed more shows since he was not as busy as Boyer or Niven (who, still enjoying a career as a major movie leading man, had won the [[Academy Award for Best Actor]] six years earlier). [[Larry Hagman]] was brought aboard for the last two episodes to help fill in for Young, who had been the lead in most of the previous episodes. The only episode in which Niven and Boyer had more or less equal roles was \"Bless You, G. Carter Huntington,\" which also featured Young in a substantial capacity. Niven briefly appears in a number of episodes but takes the lead in only three because of his schedule constraints due to making theatrical films. Also lending continuity were the presences of [[Gladys Cooper]] and [[Robert Coote]], who appeared as supporting players in most episodes. Guest appearances included [[Walter Matthau]], [[Everett Sloane]], [[Gia Scala]], [[George Sanders]], [[Broderick Crawford]], [[Darren McGavin]], [[Sally Kellerman]], [[Tol Avery]], [[Dina Merrill]], [[Eddie Albert]], [[Ida Lupino]], [[Marie Windsor]], [[Raquel Welch]], [[Elsa Martinelli]], and [[Telly Savalas]]. Four Star President, David Charnay announced a feature film revival starring David Niven and Charles Boyer in 1968, but nothing came of it. In 1989, [[Blake Edwards]] optioned the series for a revival, but ABC passed on the unproduced pilot script in 1990. \n\nRepeats of the series were aired on [[Me-TV]] during 2011-2012 and again in September 2014, and on [[Decades (TV network)|Decades]] in March 2015.

He led the first expedition to traverse the [[Northwest Passage]] by sea, from 1903 to 1906, and the first [[Amundsen's South Pole expedition|expedition to the South Pole]] in 1911. He led the first expedition proven to have reached the [[North Pole]] in a [[dirigible]] in 1926.<ref name=\"whowasfirstatthenorthpole\" /><ref name=\"flyingtothenorthpole\" /> He disappeared while taking part in a rescue mission for the airship {{ship|Airship|Italia||2}} in 1928.\n\nyes very gay\n\n== Polar treks ==\n{{more citations needed|section|date=February 2019}}\n\n=== Belgian Antarctic Expedition ===\n[[File:Belgica schiff.jpg|thumb|{{RV|Belgica|1884|6}} frozen in the ice, 1898]]\nAmundsen joined the [[Belgian Antarctic Expedition]] as first mate. This expedition, led by [[Adrien de Gerlache]] using the ship the RV ''Belgica'', became the first expedition to overwinter in Antarctica.<ref name=\"Mifflin\" /> The ''Belgica'', whether by mistake or design, became locked in the sea ice at 70\u00b030\u2032S off [[Alexander Island]], west of the [[Antarctic Peninsula]]. The crew endured a winter for which they were poorly prepared.\n\nBy Amundsen's own estimation, the doctor for the expedition, the American [[Frederick Cook]], probably saved the crew from [[scurvy]] by hunting for animals and feeding the crew fresh meat. In cases where citrus fruits are lacking, fresh meat from animals that make their own [[vitamin C]] contains enough of the vitamin to prevent scurvy, and even partly treat it. This was an important lesson for Amundsen's future expeditions.\n\n=== Northwest Passage ===\n[[File:Nlc amundsen.jpg|thumb|left|Roald Amundsen, around 1908.]]\nIn 1903, Amundsen led the first expedition to successfully traverse Canada's [[Northwest Passage]] between the [[Atlantic Ocean|Atlantic]] and [[Pacific Ocean|Pacific]] oceans. He planned a small expedition of six men in a {{nowr|45-ton}} fishing vessel, {{ship||Gj\u00f8a||2}}, in order to have flexibility. His ship had relatively shallow draft. His technique was to use a small ship and hug the coast. Amundsen had the ship outfitted with a small 13&nbsp;horsepower single-screw paraffin engine.<ref name=\"Derry\" />\n\nThey traveled via [[Baffin Bay]], the [[Parry Channel]] and then south through [[Peel Sound]], [[James Ross Strait]], [[Simpson Strait]] and [[Rae Strait]]. They spent two winters at [[King William Island]], in the harbor of what is today [[Gjoa Haven, Nunavut|Gjoa Haven]].<ref name=\"Mifflin\" /><ref name=\"Derry\" /> During this time, Amundsen and the crew learned from the local [[Netsilik Inuit]] people about [[Arctic]] survival skills, which he found invaluable in his later expedition to the South Pole. For example, he learned to use sled dogs for transportation of goods and to wear animal skins in lieu of heavy, woolen parkas, which could not keep out the cold when wet.\n\nLeaving Gjoa Haven, he sailed west and passed [[Cambridge Bay]], which had been reached from the west by [[Richard Collinson]] in 1852. Continuing to the south of [[Victoria Island (Canada)|Victoria Island]], the ship cleared the [[Canadian Arctic Archipelago]] on {{nowr|17 August 1905}}. It had to stop for the winter before going on to [[Nome, Alaska|Nome]] on Alaska's Pacific coast. The nearest telegraph station was {{convert|500|mi}} away in [[Eagle, Alaska|Eagle]]. Amundsen traveled there overland to wire a success message on 5 December, then returned to Nome in 1906. Later that year he was elected to the [[American Antiquarian Society]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.americanantiquarian.org/memberlista|title=MemberListA|publisher=}}</ref>\n\nAt this time, Amundsen learned of the [[dissolution of the union between Norway and Sweden]], and that he had a new king. The explorer sent the new king, [[Haakon VII of Norway|Haakon VII]], news that his traversing the Northwest Passage \"was a great achievement for Norway\".<ref name=\"explore\"/> He said he hoped to do more and signed it \"Your loyal subject, Roald Amundsen.\"<ref name=\"explore\"/> The crew returned to Oslo in November 1906, after almost three-and-a-half years abroad. ''Gj\u00f8a'' was returned to Norway in 1972. After a {{nowr|45-day}} trip from San Francisco on a bulk carrier, she was placed on land outside the [[Fram Museum]] in Oslo<ref name=\"explore\">{{cite book|title=''Roald Amundsen and the Exploration of the Northwest Passage''|publisher=[[Fram Museum]]|location=Oslo|year=2008|isbn=9788282350013|pages=63\u201365}}</ref>, where she is now situated inside her own dedicated building at the museum.\n\n=== South Pole Expedition ===\n{{seemain|Amundsen's South Pole expedition}}\n\n[[File:Aan de Zuidpool - p1913-160.jpg|thumb|upright=1.2|Norwegian flag at the South Pole]]\nAmundsen next planned to take an expedition to the North Pole and explore the [[Arctic Basin]]. Finding it difficult to raise funds, when he heard in 1909 that the Americans Frederick Cook and [[Robert Peary]] had claimed to reach the North Pole as a result of two different expeditions, he decided to reroute to Antarctica.<ref name=\"Simpson\" /> He was not clear about his intentions, and [[Robert F. Scott]] and the Norwegian supporters felt misled.<ref name=\"Simpson\" /> Scott was planning his own expedition to the South Pole that year. Using the ship {{ship||Fram||2}}, earlier used by [[Fridtjof Nansen]], Amundsen left Oslo for the south on 3 June 1910.<ref name=\"Simpson\" /><ref name=\"Amundsen\" /> At [[Madeira]], Amundsen alerted his men that they would be heading to Antarctica, and sent a telegram to Scott: \"Beg to inform you ''Fram'' proceeding Antarctic\u2014Amundsen.\"<ref name=\"Simpson\" />\n\nNearly six months later, the expedition arrived at the eastern edge of the [[Ross Ice Shelf]] (then known as \"the Great Ice Barrier\"), at a large inlet called the [[Bay of Whales]], on 14 January 1911. Amundsen established his base camp there, calling it {{ship||Framheim||2}}. Amundsen eschewed the heavy wool clothing worn on earlier Antarctic attempts in favour of adopting [[Inuit]]-style furred skins.<ref name=\"Thomas\" />\n\nUsing skis and dog sleds for transportation, Amundsen and his men created supply depots at 80\u00b0, 81\u00b0 and 82\u00b0&nbsp;South on the Barrier, along a line directly south to the Pole.<ref name=\"Thomas\" /> Amundsen also planned to kill some of his dogs on the way and use them as a source for fresh meat. A small group, including [[Hjalmar Johansen]], [[Kristian Prestrud]] and [[J\u00f8rgen Stubberud]], set out on 8 September, but had to abandon their trek due to extreme temperatures. The painful retreat caused a quarrel within the group, and Amundsen sent Johansen and the other two men to explore [[Edward VII Peninsula|King Edward VII Land]].\n\nA second attempt, with a team of five made up of [[Olav Bjaaland]], [[Helmer Hanssen]], [[Sverre Hassel]], [[Oscar Wisting]], and Amundsen, departed base camp on 19 October. They took four sledges and 52&nbsp;dogs. Using a route along the previously unknown [[Axel Heiberg Glacier]], they arrived at the edge of the Polar Plateau on 21 November after a four-day climb. The team  and 16&nbsp;dogs arrived at the pole on 14 December, a month before Scott's group.{{refn | name = polar date | group = n | Some sources give the date as 15 December. ''Fram'' crossed the [[International Date Line]] shortly before arriving at the [[Bay of Whales]], and thereby \"lost\" a day. Since the western and eastern hemispheres are conjoined at the South Pole, either date can be considered as correct, though Amundsen gives 14 December, both in his first telegraphed report on arrival in Hobart, and in his fuller account ''The South Pole''.{{sfn|Amundsen | loc=Vol. I, p. xvii}} }} Amundsen named their South Pole camp [[Polheim]]. Amundsen renamed the [[Antarctic Plateau]] as King Haakon VII's Plateau. They left a small tent and letter stating their accomplishment, in case they did not return safely to Framheim.\n\nThe team arrived at Framheim on 25 January 1912, with 11&nbsp;surviving dogs. They made their way off the continent and to [[Hobart]], [[Australia]], where Amundsen publicly announced his success on 7 March. He telegraphed news to backers.\n\nAmundsen's expedition benefited from his careful preparation, good equipment, appropriate clothing, a simple primary task, an understanding of dogs and their handling, and the effective use of skis. In contrast to the misfortunes of Scott's team, Amundsen's trek proved relatively smooth and uneventful.\n\n== North Polar Expeditions and Northeast Passage ==\n=== Northeast Passage ===\n{{more citations needed section|date=August 2011}}\n[[File:Polarskipet Maud.jpg|thumb|{{ship||Maud|ship|2}} in June 1918]]\nIn 1918, an expedition Amundsen began with a new ship, {{ship||Maud|ship|2}}, lasted until 1925. ''Maud'' was carefully navigated through the ice west to east through the [[Northern Sea Route|Northeast Passage]]. With him on this expedition were Oscar Wisting and Helmer Hanssen, both of whom had been part of the team to reach the South Pole. In addition, Henrik Lindstr\u00f8m was included as a cook. He suffered a stroke and was so physically reduced that he could not participate.\n\nThe goal of the expedition was to explore the unknown areas of the Arctic Ocean, strongly inspired by Fridtjof Nansen's earlier expedition with ''Fram''. The plan was to sail along the coast of [[Siberia]] and go into the ice farther to the north and east than Nansen had. In contrast to Amundsen's earlier expeditions, this was expected to yield more material for academic research, and he carried the geophysicist [[Harald Sverdrup (oceanographer)|Harald Sverdrup]] on board.\n\nThe voyage was to the northeasterly direction over the [[Kara Sea]]. Amundsen planned to freeze the ''Maud'' into the [[Arctic ice pack|polar ice cap]] and drift towards the North Pole\u2014as Nansen had done with the ''Fram''\u2014and he did so off [[Cape Chelyuskin]]. But, the ice became so thick that the ship was unable to break free, although it was designed for such a journey in heavy ice. In September 1919, the crew got the ship loose from the ice, but it froze again after eleven days somewhere between the [[New Siberian Islands]] and [[Wrangel Island]].\n\nDuring this time, Amundsen suffered a broken arm and was attacked by polar bears.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://faculty.washington.edu/karpoff/Research/Amundsen.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=16 December 2013 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130520123322/http://faculty.washington.edu/karpoff/Research/Amundsen.pdf |archivedate=20 May 2013  }}</ref> As a result, he participated little in the work outdoors, such as sleigh rides and hunting. He, Hanssen, and Wisting, along with two other men, embarked on an expedition by dog sled to Nome, Alaska, more than {{convert|1000|km}} away. But they found that the ice was not frozen solid in the [[Bering Strait]], and it could not be crossed. They sent a telegram from [[Anadyr (town)|Anadyr]] to signal their location.\n\nAfter two winters frozen in the ice, without having achieved the goal of drifting over the North Pole, Amundsen decided to go to Nome to repair the ship and buy provisions. Several of the crew ashore there, including Hanssen, did not return on time to the ship. Amundsen considered Hanssen to be in breach of contract, and dismissed him from the crew.\n\nDuring the third winter, ''Maud'' was frozen in the western Bering Strait. She finally became free and the expedition sailed south, reaching [[Seattle]], in the American Pacific Northwest in 1921 for repairs. Amundsen returned to Norway, needing to put his finances in order. He took with him two young indigenous girls, a four-year-old he adopted, Kakonita, and her companion Camilla. When Amundsen went bankrupt two years later, however, he sent the girls to be cared for by Camilla's father, who lived in eastern Russia.<ref name=\"Amundsen adoption\" />\n\nIn June 1922, Amundsen returned to ''Maud'', which had been sailed to Nome.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.sewardpeninsula.com/s/roald-amundsen.pdf|title=The Northern Explorer Roald Amundsen|last=|first=|archive-url=|archive-date=|url-status= |access-date=}}</ref> He decided to shift from the planned naval expedition to aerial ones, and arranged to charter a plane. He divided the expedition team in two: one part, led by him, was to winter over and prepare for an attempt to fly over the pole in 1923. The second team on ''Maud'', under the command of Wisting, was to resume the original plan to drift over the North Pole in the ice. The ship drifted in the ice for three years east of the New Siberian Islands, never reaching the North Pole. It was finally seized by Amundsen's creditors as  collateral for his mounting debt.\n\n=== Aerial Expeditions to the North Pole ===\n[[File:Roald Amundsen Svalbard 1925.jpg|thumb|Roald Amundsen in Svalbard (1925)]]\n\nThe 1923 attempt to fly over the Pole failed. Amundsen and [[Oskar Omdal]], of the [[Royal Norwegian Navy]], tried to fly from [[Wainwright, Alaska]], to [[Spitsbergen]] across the North Pole. When their aircraft was damaged, they abandoned the journey. To raise additional funds, Amundsen traveled around the United States in 1924 on a lecture tour. Although he was unable to reach the North Pole, the scientific results of the expedition, mainly the work of Sverdrup, have proven to be of considerable value. Much of the carefully collected scientific data was lost during the ill-fated journey of [[Peter Tessem and Paul Knutsen]], two crew members sent on a mission by Amundsen. The scientific materials were later retrieved by Russian scientist [[Nikolay Urvantsev]] from where they had been abandoned on the shores of the Kara Sea.<ref name=\"Barr1919\" />\n\nIn 1925, accompanied by [[Lincoln Ellsworth]], pilot [[Hjalmar Riiser-Larsen]], flight mechanic [[Karl Feucht]] and two other team members, Amundsen took two [[Dornier Do J]] [[flying boat]]s, the N-24 and N-25, to 87\u00b0&nbsp;44\u2032&nbsp;north. It was the northernmost latitude reached by plane up to that time. The aircraft landed a few miles apart without radio contact, yet the crews managed to reunite. The N-24 was damaged. Amundsen and his crew worked for more than three weeks to clean up an airstrip to take off from ice.<ref name=\"historynet\" /> They shovelled 600 tons of ice while consuming only one pound (400&nbsp;g) of daily food rations. In the end, the six crew members were packed into the N-25. In a remarkable feat, Riiser-Larsen took off, and they barely became airborne over the cracking ice. They returned triumphant when everyone thought they had been lost forever.\n\nIn 1926, Amundsen and 15 other men (including Ellsworth, Riiser-Larsen, Oscar Wisting, and the Italian air crew led by aeronautical engineer [[Umberto Nobile]] made the first crossing of the Arctic in the [[airship]] ''[[Norge (airship)|Norge]],'' designed by Nobile.<ref name=\"PBSorg\" /> They left [[Spitsbergen]] on 11 May 1926, flew over the North Pole on 12 May,<ref name=\"dailytelegraph\">{{cite web\n| title = South Pole conqueror Roald Amundsen won air race to the North Pole |author= Troy Lennon |publisher=  The Daily Telegraph| url = https://www.dailytelegraph.com.au/news/today-in-history/south-pole-conqueror-roald-amundsen-won-air-race-to-the-north-pole/news-story/37de4bb45a376ce3ff4c25c9d1b828ec| accessdate = 22 November 2019| date = 12 May 2016}}</ref> and landed in Alaska the following day.\n\n===Controversy over Polar Priority===\nThe three previous claims to have arrived at the North Pole: [[Frederick Cook]] in 1908; [[Robert Peary]] in 1909; and [[Richard E. Byrd]] in 1926 (just a few days before the ''Norge'') are disputed by some, as being either of dubious accuracy or outright fraud.<ref name=\"Henderson2005\" /><ref name=\"Rawlins2000\" /> If these other claims are false, the crew of the ''Norge'' would be the first explorers verified to have reached the North Pole, floated over it in the Norge in 1926.<ref name=\"whowasfirstatthenorthpole\" /><ref name=\"dailytelegraph\" /> If the ''Norge'' expedition was the first to the North Pole, Amundsen and Oscar Wisting were the first men to have reached both geographical poles, by ground or by air.\n\n== Disappearance and death ==\n{{unreferenced section|date=February 2019}}\n[[File:Latham 47 Roald Amundsen 1928.jpg|thumb|Amundsen's [[Latham 47]] flying boat]]\nAmundsen disappeared on 18 June 1928 while flying on a rescue mission in the Arctic. His team included Norwegian pilot [[Leif Dietrichson]], French pilot [[Ren\u00e9 Guilbaud]], and three more Frenchmen. They were seeking missing members of Nobile's crew, whose new airship {{ship|Airship|Italia||2}} had crashed while returning from the North Pole.

It is believed{{by whom|date=February 2019}} that the plane crashed in fog in the [[Barents Sea]], and that Amundsen and his crew were killed in the wreck, or died shortly afterward. The search for Amundsen and team was called off in September 1928 by the Norwegian government, and the bodies were never found.\n\nIn 2004 and in late August 2009, the [[Royal Norwegian Navy]] used the [[AUV|unmanned submarine]] ''Hugin 1000'' to search for the wreckage of Amundsen's plane. The searches focused on a {{convert|40|sqmi|adj=on}} area of the sea floor, and were documented by the German production company ContextTV.<ref name=\"Rincon\" /><ref name=\"searchforamundsen\" /> They found nothing from the Amundsen flight.\n\n==Honours==\nIn 1925, Amundsen was awarded the [[Hans Egede Medal]] by the [[Royal Danish Geographical Society]].<ref>{{cite journal|url=https://tidsskrift.dk/index.php/geografisktidsskrift/article/view/4567/8563|title=Geografisk Tidsskrift|via=tidsskrift.dk|journal=\u2014|access-date=9 January 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170210042432/https://tidsskrift.dk/index.php/geografisktidsskrift/article/view/4567/8563|archive-date=10 February 2017|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\n==Legacy==\n{{see also|List of things named after Roald Amundsen}}\n[[File:Amundsen-scott-south pole station 2007.jpg|thumb|[[Amundsen\u2013Scott South Pole Station]]]]\n\nOwing to Amundsen's numerous significant accomplishments in polar exploration, many places in both the Arctic and Antarctic are named after him. The [[Amundsen\u2013Scott South Pole Station]], operated by the [[United States Antarctic Program]], was jointly named in honour of Amundsen and his rival. British novelist [[Roald Dahl]] was named after Amundsen, as was Nobel Prize laureate [[Roald Hoffmann]].\n\nThe 1969 film ''[[The Red Tent (film)|The Red Tent]]'' tells the story of the Nobile expedition and Amundsen's disappearance.

He led the first expedition to traverse the [[Northwest Passage]] by sea, from 1903 to 1906, and the first [[Amundsen's South Pole expedition|expedition to the South Pole]] in 1911. He led the first expedition proven to have reached the [[North Pole]] in a [[dirigible]] in 1926.<ref name=\"whowasfirstatthenorthpole\" /><ref name=\"flyingtothenorthpole\" /> He disappeared while taking part in a rescue mission for the airship {{ship|Airship|Italia||2}} in 1928.\n\n== Early life ==\nAmundsen was born into a family of Norwegian shipowners and captains in [[Borge, \u00d8stfold|Borge]], between the towns [[Fredrikstad]] and [[Sarpsborg]]. His parents were Jens Amundsen and Hanna Sahlqvist. Roald was the fourth son in the family. His mother wanted him to avoid the family maritime trade and encouraged him to become a doctor, a promise that Amundsen kept until his mother died when he was aged 21. He promptly quit university for a life at sea.<ref name=\"Thomas\" />\n\nWhen he was fifteen years old, Amundsen was enthralled by reading Sir [[John Franklin]]'s narratives of his overland Arctic expeditions. Amundsen wrote \"I read them with a fervid fascination which has shaped the whole course of my life\".<ref name=\"Life\">{{cite book | title=My Life as an Explorer | publisher=Doubleday, Page & company | author=Amundsen, Roald | year=1927 | location=Garden City, NY}}</ref>\n\n== Polar treks ==\n{{more citations needed|section|date=February 2019}}\n\n=== Belgian Antarctic Expedition ===\n[[File:Belgica schiff.jpg|thumb|{{RV|Belgica|1884|6}} frozen in the ice, 1898]]\nAmundsen joined the [[Belgian Antarctic Expedition]] as first mate. This expedition, led by [[Adrien de Gerlache]] using the ship the RV ''Belgica'', became the first expedition to overwinter in Antarctica.<ref name=\"Mifflin\" /> The ''Belgica'', whether by mistake or design, became locked in the sea ice at 70\u00b030\u2032S off [[Alexander Island]], west of the [[Antarctic Peninsula]]. The crew endured a winter for which they were poorly prepared.\n\nBy Amundsen's own estimation, the doctor for the expedition, the American [[Frederick Cook]], probably saved the crew from [[scurvy]] by hunting for animals and feeding the crew fresh meat. In cases where citrus fruits are lacking, fresh meat from animals that make their own [[vitamin C]] contains enough of the vitamin to prevent scurvy, and even partly treat it. This was an important lesson for Amundsen's future expeditions.\n\n=== Northwest Passage ===\n[[File:Nlc amundsen.jpg|thumb|left|Roald Amundsen, around 1908.]]\nIn 1903, Amundsen led the first expedition to successfully traverse Canada's [[Northwest Passage]] between the [[Atlantic Ocean|Atlantic]] and [[Pacific Ocean|Pacific]] oceans. He planned a small expedition of six men in a {{nowr|45-ton}} fishing vessel, {{ship||Gj\u00f8a||2}}, in order to have flexibility. His ship had relatively shallow draft. His technique was to use a small ship and hug the coast. Amundsen had the ship outfitted with a small 13&nbsp;horsepower single-screw paraffin engine.<ref name=\"Derry\" />\n\nThey traveled via [[Baffin Bay]], the [[Parry Channel]] and then south through [[Peel Sound]], [[James Ross Strait]], [[Simpson Strait]] and [[Rae Strait]]. They spent two winters at [[King William Island]], in the harbor of what is today [[Gjoa Haven, Nunavut|Gjoa Haven]].<ref name=\"Mifflin\" /><ref name=\"Derry\" /> During this time, Amundsen and the crew learned from the local [[Netsilik Inuit]] people about [[Arctic]] survival skills, which he found invaluable in his later expedition to the South Pole. For example, he learned to use sled dogs for transportation of goods and to wear animal skins in lieu of heavy, woolen parkas, which could not keep out the cold when wet.\n\nLeaving Gjoa Haven, he sailed west and passed [[Cambridge Bay]], which had been reached from the west by [[Richard Collinson]] in 1852. Continuing to the south of [[Victoria Island (Canada)|Victoria Island]], the ship cleared the [[Canadian Arctic Archipelago]] on {{nowr|17 August 1905}}. It had to stop for the winter before going on to [[Nome, Alaska|Nome]] on Alaska's Pacific coast. The nearest telegraph station was {{convert|500|mi}} away in [[Eagle, Alaska|Eagle]]. Amundsen traveled there overland to wire a success message on 5 December, then returned to Nome in 1906. Later that year he was elected to the [[American Antiquarian Society]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.americanantiquarian.org/memberlista|title=MemberListA|publisher=}}</ref>\n\nAt this time, Amundsen learned of the [[dissolution of the union between Norway and Sweden]], and that he had a new king. The explorer sent the new king, [[Haakon VII of Norway|Haakon VII]], news that his traversing the Northwest Passage \"was a great achievement for Norway\".<ref name=\"explore\"/> He said he hoped to do more and signed it \"Your loyal subject, Roald Amundsen.\"<ref name=\"explore\"/> The crew returned to Oslo in November 1906, after almost three-and-a-half years abroad. ''Gj\u00f8a'' was returned to Norway in 1972. After a {{nowr|45-day}} trip from San Francisco on a bulk carrier, she was placed on land outside the [[Fram Museum]] in Oslo<ref name=\"explore\">{{cite book|title=''Roald Amundsen and the Exploration of the Northwest Passage''|publisher=[[Fram Museum]]|location=Oslo|year=2008|isbn=9788282350013|pages=63\u201365}}</ref>, where she is now situated inside her own dedicated building at the museum.\n\n=== South Pole Expedition ===\n{{seemain|Amundsen's South Pole expedition}}\n\n[[File:Aan de Zuidpool - p1913-160.jpg|thumb|upright=1.2|Norwegian flag at the South Pole]]\nAmundsen next planned to take an expedition to the North Pole and explore the [[Arctic Basin]]. Finding it difficult to raise funds, when he heard in 1909 that the Americans Frederick Cook and [[Robert Peary]] had claimed to reach the North Pole as a result of two different expeditions, he decided to reroute to Antarctica.<ref name=\"Simpson\" /> He was not clear about his intentions, and [[Robert F. Scott]] and the Norwegian supporters felt misled.<ref name=\"Simpson\" /> Scott was planning his own expedition to the South Pole that year. Using the ship {{ship||Fram||2}}, earlier used by [[Fridtjof Nansen]], Amundsen left Oslo for the south on 3 June 1910.<ref name=\"Simpson\" /><ref name=\"Amundsen\" /> At [[Madeira]], Amundsen alerted his men that they would be heading to Antarctica, and sent a telegram to Scott: \"Beg to inform you ''Fram'' proceeding Antarctic\u2014Amundsen.\"<ref name=\"Simpson\" />\n\nNearly six months later, the expedition arrived at the eastern edge of the [[Ross Ice Shelf]] (then known as \"the Great Ice Barrier\"), at a large inlet called the [[Bay of Whales]], on 14 January 1911. Amundsen established his base camp there, calling it {{ship||Framheim||2}}. Amundsen eschewed the heavy wool clothing worn on earlier Antarctic attempts in favour of adopting [[Inuit]]-style furred skins.<ref name=\"Thomas\" />\n\nUsing skis and dog sleds for transportation, Amundsen and his men created supply depots at 80\u00b0, 81\u00b0 and 82\u00b0&nbsp;South on the Barrier, along a line directly south to the Pole.<ref name=\"Thomas\" /> Amundsen also planned to kill some of his dogs on the way and use them as a source for fresh meat. A small group, including [[Hjalmar Johansen]], [[Kristian Prestrud]] and [[J\u00f8rgen Stubberud]], set out on 8 September, but had to abandon their trek due to extreme temperatures. The painful retreat caused a quarrel within the group, and Amundsen sent Johansen and the other two men to explore [[Edward VII Peninsula|King Edward VII Land]].\n\nA second attempt, with a team of five made up of [[Olav Bjaaland]], [[Helmer Hanssen]], [[Sverre Hassel]], [[Oscar Wisting]], and Amundsen, departed base camp on 19 October. They took four sledges and 52&nbsp;dogs. Using a route along the previously unknown [[Axel Heiberg Glacier]], they arrived at the edge of the Polar Plateau on 21 November after a four-day climb. The team  and 16&nbsp;dogs arrived at the pole on 14 December, a month before Scott's group.{{refn | name = polar date | group = n | Some sources give the date as 15 December. ''Fram'' crossed the [[International Date Line]] shortly before arriving at the [[Bay of Whales]], and thereby \"lost\" a day. Since the western and eastern hemispheres are conjoined at the South Pole, either date can be considered as correct, though Amundsen gives 14 December, both in his first telegraphed report on arrival in Hobart, and in his fuller account ''The South Pole''.{{sfn|Amundsen | loc=Vol. I, p. xvii}} }} Amundsen named their South Pole camp [[Polheim]]. Amundsen renamed the [[Antarctic Plateau]] as King Haakon VII's Plateau. They left a small tent and letter stating their accomplishment, in case they did not return safely to Framheim.\n\nThe team arrived at Framheim on 25 January 1912, with 11&nbsp;surviving dogs. They made their way off the continent and to [[Hobart]], [[Australia]], where Amundsen publicly announced his success on 7 March. He telegraphed news to backers.\n\nAmundsen's expedition benefited from his careful preparation, good equipment, appropriate clothing, a simple primary task, an understanding of dogs and their handling, and the effective use of skis. In contrast to the misfortunes of Scott's team, Amundsen's trek proved relatively smooth and uneventful.\n\n== North Polar Expeditions and Northeast Passage ==\n=== Northeast Passage ===\n{{more citations needed section|date=August 2011}}\n[[File:Polarskipet Maud.jpg|thumb|{{ship||Maud|ship|2}} in June 1918]]\nIn 1918, an expedition Amundsen began with a new ship, {{ship||Maud|ship|2}}, lasted until 1925. ''Maud'' was carefully navigated through the ice west to east through the [[Northern Sea Route|Northeast Passage]]. With him on this expedition were Oscar Wisting and Helmer Hanssen, both of whom had been part of the team to reach the South Pole. In addition, Henrik Lindstr\u00f8m was included as a cook. He suffered a stroke and was so physically reduced that he could not participate.\n\nThe goal of the expedition was to explore the unknown areas of the Arctic Ocean, strongly inspired by Fridtjof Nansen's earlier expedition with ''Fram''. The plan was to sail along the coast of [[Siberia]] and go into the ice farther to the north and east than Nansen had. In contrast to Amundsen's earlier expeditions, this was expected to yield more material for academic research, and he carried the geophysicist [[Harald Sverdrup (oceanographer)|Harald Sverdrup]] on board.\n\nThe voyage was to the northeasterly direction over the [[Kara Sea]]. Amundsen planned to freeze the ''Maud'' into the [[Arctic ice pack|polar ice cap]] and drift towards the North Pole\u2014as Nansen had done with the ''Fram''\u2014and he did so off [[Cape Chelyuskin]]. But, the ice became so thick that the ship was unable to break free, although it was designed for such a journey in heavy ice. In September 1919, the crew got the ship loose from the ice, but it froze again after eleven days somewhere between the [[New Siberian Islands]] and [[Wrangel Island]].\n\nDuring this time, Amundsen suffered a broken arm and was attacked by polar bears.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://faculty.washington.edu/karpoff/Research/Amundsen.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=16 December 2013 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130520123322/http://faculty.washington.edu/karpoff/Research/Amundsen.pdf |archivedate=20 May 2013  }}</ref> As a result, he participated little in the work outdoors, such as sleigh rides and hunting. He, Hanssen, and Wisting, along with two other men, embarked on an expedition by dog sled to Nome, Alaska, more than {{convert|1000|km}} away. But they found that the ice was not frozen solid in the [[Bering Strait]], and it could not be crossed. They sent a telegram from [[Anadyr (town)|Anadyr]] to signal their location.\n\nAfter two winters frozen in the ice, without having achieved the goal of drifting over the North Pole, Amundsen decided to go to Nome to repair the ship and buy provisions. Several of the crew ashore there, including Hanssen, did not return on time to the ship. Amundsen considered Hanssen to be in breach of contract, and dismissed him from the crew.\n\nDuring the third winter, ''Maud'' was frozen in the western Bering Strait. She finally became free and the expedition sailed south, reaching [[Seattle]], in the American Pacific Northwest in 1921 for repairs. Amundsen returned to Norway, needing to put his finances in order. He took with him two young indigenous girls, a four-year-old he adopted, Kakonita, and her companion Camilla. When Amundsen went bankrupt two years later, however, he sent the girls to be cared for by Camilla's father, who lived in eastern Russia.<ref name=\"Amundsen adoption\" />\n\nIn June 1922, Amundsen returned to ''Maud'', which had been sailed to Nome.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.sewardpeninsula.com/s/roald-amundsen.pdf|title=The Northern Explorer Roald Amundsen|last=|first=|archive-url=|archive-date=|url-status= |access-date=}}</ref> He decided to shift from the planned naval expedition to aerial ones, and arranged to charter a plane. He divided the expedition team in two: one part, led by him, was to winter over and prepare for an attempt to fly over the pole in 1923. The second team on ''Maud'', under the command of Wisting, was to resume the original plan to drift over the North Pole in the ice. The ship drifted in the ice for three years east of the New Siberian Islands, never reaching the North Pole. It was finally seized by Amundsen's creditors as  collateral for his mounting debt.\n\n=== Aerial Expeditions to the North Pole ===\n[[File:Roald Amundsen Svalbard 1925.jpg|thumb|Roald Amundsen in Svalbard (1925)]]\n\nThe 1923 attempt to fly over the Pole failed. Amundsen and [[Oskar Omdal]], of the [[Royal Norwegian Navy]], tried to fly from [[Wainwright, Alaska]], to [[Spitsbergen]] across the North Pole. When their aircraft was damaged, they abandoned the journey. To raise additional funds, Amundsen traveled around the United States in 1924 on a lecture tour. Although he was unable to reach the North Pole, the scientific results of the expedition, mainly the work of Sverdrup, have proven to be of considerable value. Much of the carefully collected scientific data was lost during the ill-fated journey of [[Peter Tessem and Paul Knutsen]], two crew members sent on a mission by Amundsen. The scientific materials were later retrieved by Russian scientist [[Nikolay Urvantsev]] from where they had been abandoned on the shores of the Kara Sea.<ref name=\"Barr1919\" />\n\nIn 1925, accompanied by [[Lincoln Ellsworth]], pilot [[Hjalmar Riiser-Larsen]], flight mechanic [[Karl Feucht]] and two other team members, Amundsen took two [[Dornier Do J]] [[flying boat]]s, the N-24 and N-25, to 87\u00b0&nbsp;44\u2032&nbsp;north. It was the northernmost latitude reached by plane up to that time. The aircraft landed a few miles apart without radio contact, yet the crews managed to reunite. The N-24 was damaged. Amundsen and his crew worked for more than three weeks to clean up an airstrip to take off from ice.<ref name=\"historynet\" /> They shovelled 600 tons of ice while consuming only one pound (400&nbsp;g) of daily food rations. In the end, the six crew members were packed into the N-25. In a remarkable feat, Riiser-Larsen took off, and they barely became airborne over the cracking ice. They returned triumphant when everyone thought they had been lost forever.\n\nIn 1926, Amundsen and 15 other men (including Ellsworth, Riiser-Larsen, Oscar Wisting, and the Italian air crew led by aeronautical engineer [[Umberto Nobile]] made the first crossing of the Arctic in the [[airship]] ''[[Norge (airship)|Norge]],'' designed by Nobile.<ref name=\"PBSorg\" /> They left [[Spitsbergen]] on 11 May 1926, flew over the North Pole on 12 May,<ref name=\"dailytelegraph\">{{cite web\n| title = South Pole conqueror Roald Amundsen won air race to the North Pole |author= Troy Lennon |publisher=  The Daily Telegraph| url = https://www.dailytelegraph.com.au/news/today-in-history/south-pole-conqueror-roald-amundsen-won-air-race-to-the-north-pole/news-story/37de4bb45a376ce3ff4c25c9d1b828ec| accessdate = 22 November 2019| date = 12 May 2016}}</ref> and landed in Alaska the following day.\n\n===Controversy over Polar Priority===\nThe three previous claims to have arrived at the North Pole: [[Frederick Cook]] in 1908; [[Robert Peary]] in 1909; and [[Richard E. Byrd]] in 1926 (just a few days before the ''Norge'') are disputed by some, as being either of dubious accuracy or outright fraud.<ref name=\"Henderson2005\" /><ref name=\"Rawlins2000\" /> If these other claims are false, the crew of the ''Norge'' would be the first explorers verified to have reached the North Pole, floated over it in the Norge in 1926.<ref name=\"whowasfirstatthenorthpole\" /><ref name=\"dailytelegraph\" /> If the ''Norge'' expedition was the first to the North Pole, Amundsen and Oscar Wisting were the first men to have reached both geographical poles, by ground or by air.\n\n== Disappearance and death ==\n{{unreferenced section|date=February 2019}}\n[[File:Latham 47 Roald Amundsen 1928.jpg|thumb|Amundsen's [[Latham 47]] flying boat]]\nAmundsen disappeared on 18 June 1928 while flying on a rescue mission in the Arctic. His team included Norwegian pilot [[Leif Dietrichson]], French pilot [[Ren\u00e9 Guilbaud]], and three more Frenchmen. They were seeking missing members of Nobile's crew, whose new airship {{ship|Airship|Italia||2}} had crashed while returning from the North Pole. Amundsen's French [[Latham 47]] flying boat\n[[List of aerial disappearances|never returned]].\n\nLater, a wing-float and bottom gasoline tank from the plane, which had been adapted as a replacement wing-float, were found near the [[Troms\u00f8]] coast. It is believed{{by whom|date=February 2019}} that the plane crashed in fog in the [[Barents Sea]], and that Amundsen and his crew were killed in the wreck, or died shortly afterward. The search for Amundsen and team was called off in September 1928 by the Norwegian government, and the bodies were never found.\n\nIn 2004 and in late August 2009, the [[Royal Norwegian Navy]] used the [[AUV|unmanned submarine]] ''Hugin 1000'' to search for the wreckage of Amundsen's plane. The searches focused on a {{convert|40|sqmi|adj=on}} area of the sea floor, and were documented by the German production company ContextTV.<ref name=\"Rincon\" /><ref name=\"searchforamundsen\" /> They found nothing from the Amundsen flight.\n\n==Honours==\nIn 1925, Amundsen was awarded the [[Hans Egede Medal]] by the [[Royal Danish Geographical Society]].<ref>{{cite journal|url=https://tidsskrift.dk/index.php/geografisktidsskrift/article/view/4567/8563|title=Geografisk Tidsskrift|via=tidsskrift.dk|journal=\u2014|access-date=9 January 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170210042432/https://tidsskrift.dk/index.php/geografisktidsskrift/article/view/4567/8563|archive-date=10 February 2017|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\n==Legacy==\n{{see also|List of things named after Roald Amundsen}}\n[[File:Amundsen-scott-south pole station 2007.jpg|thumb|[[Amundsen\u2013Scott South Pole Station]]]]\n\nOwing to Amundsen's numerous significant accomplishments in polar exploration, many places in both the Arctic and Antarctic are named after him. The [[Amundsen\u2013Scott South Pole Station]], operated by the [[United States Antarctic Program]], was jointly named in honour of Amundsen and his rival. British novelist [[Roald Dahl]] was named after Amundsen, as was Nobel Prize laureate [[Roald Hoffmann]].\n\nThe 1969 film ''[[The Red Tent (film)|The Red Tent]]'' tells the story of the Nobile expedition and Amundsen's disappearance.
