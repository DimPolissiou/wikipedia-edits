[[England]] has never possessed a formal written [[constitution]], with the result that modern administration (and the judicial system) is based on precedent, and is derived from administrative powers granted (usually by [[the Crown]]) to older systems, such as that of the [[shire]]s.\n\nThe concept of [[local government in England]] spans back into the [[history of Anglo-Saxon England]] (c. 700-1066), and certain aspects of its modern system are directly derived from this time; particularly the paradigm that towns and the countryside should be administrated separately. In this context, the [[feudalism|feudal system]] introduced by the [[Normans]], and perhaps lasting 300 years, can be seen as a 'blip', before earlier patterns of administration re-emerged.\n\nThe dramatic increase in population, and change in population distribution caused by the [[Industrial Revolution]] necessitated similarly dramatic reform in local administration in England, which was achieved gradually throughout the 19th century. Much of the 20th century was spent searching for an idealised system of local government. The most sweeping change in that period was the [[Local Government Act 1972]], which resulted in a uniform two-tier system of counties and districts being introduced in 1974; however, further waves of reform have led to a more heterogeneous system in use today.\n\n==Origins of local government in England==\n{{Refimprove|original research|date=March 2020}}\nMuch of the basic structure of local government in [[England]] is derived directly from the [[Kingdom of England]] (which became part of the [[Kingdom of Great Britain]] in 1707 then later part of the [[United Kingdom]]). There are thus aspects of the modern system which are not shared with the other constituent parts of the UK, namely [[Scotland]], [[Wales]] and [[Northern Ireland]].\n\nThe Kingdom of England was by origin an extension of the [[Anglo-Saxons|Saxon]] [[Wessex|Kingdom of Wessex]] into the other regions, supplanting amongst others the former kingdoms of [[Mercia]], [[Northumbria]] and [[Kingdom of East Anglia]], and unifying the [[Anglo-Saxons|Anglo-Saxon peoples]] of the [[British Isles]]. Some of the basic elements of modern local government therefore derive from the ancient system of Wessex.\n\n===Anglo-Saxon local government (700\u20131066 AD)===\nThe [[Kingdom of Wessex]], c. 790 AD, was divided into administrative units known as [[shire]]s. Each shire was governed by an [[Ealdorman]], a major nobleman of Wessex appointed to the post by the King. The term 'Ealdorman' (meaning 'elder-man') gradually merged with the Scandinavian Eorl/Jarl (designating an important chieftain), to form the modern 'Earl'. However, the Shires were not comparable with later [[Earldoms]], and were not held in the Ealdorman's own right.\n\nThe shires of Wessex at this time have essentially survived to the present day, as [[County|counties]] of England (currently [[ceremonial counties]]). They included Defnascir ([[Devon]]), Sumorsaete ([[Somerset]]), Dornsaete ([[Dorset]]), Wiltunscir ([[Wiltshire]]), Hamptunscir ([[Hampshire]]). When Wessex conquered the petty kingdoms of southern England, namely [[Kingdom of Kent|Cent]] and that of the [[Kingdom of Sussex|South Saxons]], these were simply reconstituted as shires (modern [[Kent]] and [[Sussex]] respectively).\n\nAs Wessex took over progressively larger areas of Mercia, East Anglia and Northumbria, the new lands were divided into shires, usually named after the principal town in the new shire; hence [[Northamptonshire]], [[Oxfordshire]], [[Derbyshire]] and so on. Most of the [[Historic counties of England|historic counties]] of England (and modern [[Ceremonial counties]]) south of the [[Mersey]] and [[Humber]] derive directly from this time.\n\nAnother important official of the shire was the shire-reeve, from whence the more modern [[sheriff]] is derived. The shire-reeve was responsible for upholding the law, and holding civil and criminal courts in the shire.<ref>W. Blackstone, COMMENTARIES ON THE LAWS OF ENGLAND 339, 343 (1541)</ref> The office of sheriff is still important in some Anglophone countries (e.g. the USA), but now a ceremonial role in England.\n\nBelow the level of the shire, the Anglo-Saxon system was very different from the later systems of local government. The shire was divided into an unlimited number of [[Hundred (administrative division)|hundreds]] (or [[Hundred (administrative division)|wapentakes]] in the [[Danelaw]] counties of [[Yorkshire]], [[Derbyshire]], [[Leicestershire]], [[Northamptonshire]], [[Nottinghamshire]], [[Rutland]] and [[Lincolnshire]]). Each hundred consisted of 10 groups of 10 households. A group of 10 households was a [[Tithing (country subdivision)|tithing]] and each household held one [[Hide (unit)|hide]] of land. The hide was an arbitrary unit of land which was deemed able to support one household, and thus could vary in size. The whole hundred system was thus both very flexible and fluid, varying with changes in population etc.\n\nHundreds were led by a 'hundred-man', and had their own 'hundred' courts. The members of the hundreds (or tithings, etc.) were collectively held responsible for each individuals conduct, thereby decentralising the administration of justice upon the people themselves. Hundreds were used as administrative units for the raising of armies, collection of taxes and so forth.\n\n===The Norman conquest (1066\u20131100)===\n[[File:DomesdayEnglandMap.png|England in 1086 showing hundreds, wapentakes and wards|thumb|upright=2.0|right]]\nThe conquest of England by the [[Normans]] in 1066 brought about many changes in the local administration of the country, but some aspects were retained. One of the biggest changes was the introduction of a severe feudal system by the Normans. Although [[Anglo-Saxons|Anglo-Saxon]] society had also been essentially [[feudal]] in character, the Norman system was much more rigid, centralised and thorough. [[William the Conqueror]] claimed ultimate possession of virtually all the land in England and asserted the right to dispose of it as he saw fit. Thenceforth, all land was \"held\" from the King.<ref>Carpenter, D. (2004) The Struggle for Mastery: Britain 1066-1284, Penguin history of Britain, London : Penguin, {{ISBN|0-14-014824-8}} pp. 81, 84, 86.</ref> The country was divided up into fiefs which William distributed amongst his followers. The [[fiefdom|fiefs]] were generally small and given out piecemeal, to deprive William's vassals of large power-bases.\n\nSince each fiefdom was governed more or less independently of each other by the feudal lords, the Anglo-Saxon [[shire]] system became less important. However, the system did continue in use. The shires (referred to by the Normans as 'counties', in analogy to the system in use in medieval France) remained the major geographical division of England. North of the Humber, the Normans reorganised the shires to form one new large county, that of [[Yorkshire]]. Immediately after the conquest the rest of northern England does not seem to have been in Norman hands; as the remainder of England came under Norman rule it too was also constituted into new counties (e.g. [[Lancashire]], [[Northumberland]]) In the period immediately after the Norman conquest, hundreds also remained as the basic administrative unit. In the [[Domesday Book]], the great Norman work of bureaucracy, the survey is taken shire by shire, and hundred by hundred. At this time, if not before, hundreds must have become more static units of land, since the more fluid nature of the original system would not have been compatible with the rigid feudal system of the Normans. Although hundreds continued to alter in size and number after the Domesday Book, they became more permanent administrative divisions, rather than groups of households.\n\n===The medieval period (1100\u20131300)===\nDuring the medieval period, local administration basically remained in the hands of the feudal aristocracy, who governed affairs in their fiefs. The enserfment of the population by the Norman system diminished the importance of hundreds as self-regulating [[social unit]]s since law was not imposed from above, and since the population was immobilised. Instead the basic [[social unit]] became the [[parish]], [[manorialism|manor]] or [[township]].\n\nThe counties remained important as the basis for the legal system. The sheriff remained the paramount legal officer in each county, and each county eventually had its own court system for trials (the [[Quarter Sessions]]). Although the Hundred Courts continued in use resolving local disputes, they diminished in importance. During the reigns of Henry III, Edward I and Edward II a new system emerged. Knights in each county were appointed as [[Conservator of the Peace]], being required to help keep the King's Peace. Eventually they were given the right to try petty offences which had formerly been tried in the Hundred Courts. These officers were the forerunners of the modern [[Magistrates' Court (England and Wales)|magistrates' court]]s and [[justices of the peace]].\n\n====The rise of the town====\nThe feudal system introduced by the Normans was designed to govern rural areas which could easily be controlled by a lord. Since the system was based upon the exploitation of the labour and produce of enserfed peasant farmers, the system was unsuited to governing larger towns, where more complex economic activity was required. At the time of the Norman conquest true urban centres were few in England, but during the early medieval period a growing population and increased mercantile activity led to an increase in the importance of towns.\n\nLondon, by far the largest settlement in England during the medieval period, had been marked out for special status as early as the reign of [[Alfred the Great]]. William the Conqueror granted London a royal charter in 1075, confirming some of the autonomy and privileges that the city had accumulated during the Saxon period. The charter gave London self-governing status, paying taxes directly to the king in return for remaining outside the feudal system. The citizens were therefore 'burgesses' rather than serfs, and in effect free men. William's son [[Henry I of England|Henry I]] granted charters to other towns, often to establish market towns.\n\nHowever, it was [[Henry II of England|Henry II]] who greatly expanded the separation of towns from the countryside. He granted around 150 royal charters to towns around England, which were thereafter referred to as '[[borough]]s'.<ref>[http://www.bedford.gov.uk/Default.aspx/Web/TheRoyalCharter The Royal Charter<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> For an annual rent to the crown, the towns were given various privileges, such as the exemption from feudal dues, the right to hold a market and the rights to levy certain taxes. It should be noted however, that not all market towns established during this period were self-governing.\n\nThe self-governing boroughs are the first recognisably modern aspect of local government in England. Generally they were run by a town [[corporation]], made up of council [[aldermen]], the town 'elders'. Although each corporation was different, they were usually self-elected, new members being co-opted by the existing members. A [[mayor]] was often elected by the council to serve for a given period. The idea of a town council to run the affairs of an individual town remains an important tenet of local government in England today.\n\n====Political representation====\nThe [[Parliament of England|English Parliament]] developed during the 13th century, and would eventually become the ''de facto'' governing body for the country. In 1297, it was decreed that the representatives to the [[House of Commons of the United Kingdom|House of Commons]] would be allocated based on the administrative units of counties and boroughs \u2014 two knights from each shire, and two burgesses from each borough. This system would remain essentially unchanged (despite massive increases in population in some non-borough areas, and the decreased importance of some boroughs) until the [[Reform Act of 1832]].\n\n===The medieval period (1300\u20131500)===\n\n====The decline of the feudal system====\nBy the beginning of the 14th century, the feudal system in England was in decline; the [[Black Death]] (1348\u20131350) causing mass depopulation, is widely held to signal the effective end of feudalism. Thereafter the relationship between lord and vassal become more a relationship between landlord and tenant. The breakdown of the feudal power left the shires without ''de jure'' administration. The legal system and sheriffs remained for each county, and what local administration was required was undoubtedly provided by individual parishes or by the local landowners. In an era of very 'small government', the requirement for higher levels of administration was probably minimal. In towns, where more governance would have been required, the town councils continued to manage local affairs.\n\n====Counties corporate====\n{{Main|County corporate}}\nA further extension of the borough system occurred in the later medieval period. While borough status gave towns specific rights ''within'' counties, some cities petitioned for greater independence. Those cities (or towns) were therefore awarded complete effective independence from the county including their own [[sheriff]]s, [[Quarter Sessions]] and other officials, and were sometimes given governing rights over a swath of surrounding countryside. They were referred to in the form \"Town and County of ...\" or \"City and County of ...\", and became known as the counties corporate. They included the City and County of York, Bristol, Canterbury and Chester.\n\nOther counties corporate were created to deal with specific local problems, such as border conflict (in the case of [[Berwick-upon-Tweed]]) and [[piracy]] (in the case of [[Poole]] and [[Haverfordwest]]).\n\n===Later changes in local government (1500\u20131832)===\nIn the 1540s the office of [[Lord Lieutenant]] was instituted in each county, effectively replacing feudal lords as the Crown's direct representative in that county. The lieutenants had a military role, previously exercised by the sheriffs, and were made responsible for raising and organising the county [[militia]]. The county lieutenancies were subsequently given responsibility for the [[Volunteer Force (Great Britain)|Volunteer Force]]. In 1871 the lieutenants lost their position as head of the militia, and the office became largely ceremonial.<ref>Regulation of Forces Act 1871</ref> The [[Cardwell Reforms|Cardwell]] and [[Childers Reforms]] of the [[British Army]] linked the recruiting areas of infantry regiments to the counties.\n\nFrom the 16th century the county was increasingly used as a unit of [[local government]]. Although 'small government' was still the accepted norm, there were an increasing number of responsibilities which could not be fulfilled by individual communities. The justices of the peace therefore took on various administrative functions known as \"county business\". This was transacted at the [[Quarter Sessions]], summoned four times a year by the Lord Lieutenant. By the 19th century the county magistrates exercised powers over the licensing of alehouses, the construction of bridges, prisons and asylums, superintendence of main roads, public buildings and charitable institutions, and the regulation of weights and measures.<ref>Carl H. E. Zangerl, ''The Social Composition of the County Magistracy in England and Wales, 1831\u20131887'', ''The Journal of British Studies'', Vol. 11, No. 1. (November 1971), pp. 113\u201325.</ref> The justices were empowered to levy local taxes to support these activities, and in 1739 these were unified as a single \"county rate\" under the control of a county treasurer.<ref>''An Act for the more easy assessing, collecting and levying of County Rates'', (12 Geo. II c. 29)</ref> In order to build and maintain roads and bridges, a salaried county surveyor was to be appointed.<ref>Bridges Act 1803 (1803 c. 59) and Grand Jury Act 1833 (1833 c. 78)</ref>\n\nThese county functions were attached to the legal system, since this was the only body which acted county-wide at that time. However, in this ''ad hoc'' system the beginnings of county councils, another central element in modern local government, can be observed. The counties themselves remained more-or-less static between the [[Law in Wales Acts]] of 1535\u201342, and the Great Reform Act of 1832.\n\n====Parishes====\nThe ecclesiastical [[parish#England|parishes]] of the Church of England also came to play a ''de jure'' roles in local government from this time. It is probable that this merely confirmed the status quo \u2014 people of rural communities would have taken care of what local administration was required. Although the parishes were in no sense governmental organisations, laws were passed requiring parishes to carry out certain responsibilities. From 1555, parishes were responsible for the upkeep of nearby roads. From 1605 parishes were responsible for administering the [[English Poor Laws|Poor Law]], and were required to collect money for their own poor. The parishes were run by parish councils, known as \"[[vestry#Administrative vestry|vestries]]\", often elected from amongst the rate-payers, but often self-selecting.\n\n==The evolution of modern local government (1832-1974)==\n===The Great Reform Act (1832)===\nThe development of modern government in England began with the [[Reform Act 1832|Great Reform Act]] of 1832. The impetus for this act was provided by corrupt practices in the House of Commons, and by the massive increase in population occurring during the [[Industrial Revolution]]. Boroughs and counties were generally able to send two representatives to the Commons. Theoretically, the honour of electing members of Parliament belonged to the wealthiest and most flourishing towns in the kingdom, thus, boroughs that ceased to be successful could be disenfranchised by the Crown.<ref>Blackstone (1765), p. 168.</ref> In practice, however, many tiny [[hamlet (place)|hamlet]]s became boroughs, especially between the reigns of [[Henry VIII of England|Henry VIII]] and [[Charles II of Great Britain|Charles II]]. Likewise, boroughs that had flourished during the Middle Ages, but had since fallen into decay, were allowed to continue sending representatives to Parliament. The royal prerogative of enfranchising and disfranchising boroughs fell into disuse after the reign of Charles II; as a result, these historical anomalies became set in stone.<ref>May (1896), vol. I, p. 329.</ref>\n\nIn addition, only male owners of [[fee simple|freehold property]] or land worth at least forty shillings in a particular county were entitled to vote in that county; but those who owned property in multiple constituencies could vote in every constituency for which he owned sufficiently valuable property; there was normally no requirement for an individual to actually inhabit a constituency in order to vote there. The size of the English county electorate in 1831 has been estimated at only 200,000.<ref>Phillips and Wetherell (1995), p. 413.</ref> This meant that the very wealthy formed the majority of the electorate and could often vote multiple times. In small boroughs that had fallen into decay, there were often only a handful of eligible voters; these \u201crotten\u201d boroughs were therefore effectively controlled by the local aristocracy.\n\nThe Reform Act (and its successors) attempted to address these issues, by abolishing rotten boroughs (as both constituencies and administrative units), enfranchising the industrial towns as new parliamentary boroughs, increasing the proportion of the population eligible to vote, and ending corrupt practices in parliament. Although this did not directly affect local government, it provided impetus to reform outdated, obsolete and unfair practices elsewhere in government.\n\n===The Municipal Corporations Act (1835)===\nAfter the reform of parliamentary constituencies, the boroughs established by royal charter during the previous seven centuries were reformed by the [[Municipal Corporations Act 1835]]. The Act required members of town councils ([[municipal corporation]]s) in [[England and Wales]] to be elected by [[Rates (tax)|ratepayers]] and councils to publish their financial accounts.\n\nBefore the passing of the Act, the [[municipal borough]]s varied depending upon their charters.  In some boroughs, corporations had become self-perpetuating [[oligarchy|oligarchies]], with membership of the corporation being for life, and vacancies filled by [[co-option]].\n\nThe Act reformed 178 boroughs immediately; there remained more than one hundred [[Unreformed boroughs in England and Wales 1835 - 1886|unreformed boroughs]], which generally either fell into [[desuetude]] or were replaced later under the terms of the Act. The last of these were not reformed or abolished until 1886. The [[City of London]] remains unreformed to the present day. The Act allowed unincorporated towns to petition for incorporation. The industrial towns of the Midlands and North quickly took advantage of this, with [[Birmingham]] and [[Manchester]] becoming boroughs as soon as 1838.  Altogether, [[Boroughs incorporated in England and Wales 1835 - 1882|62 additional boroughs]] were incorporated under the act. With this Act, the boroughs (thereafter \u201cmunicipal boroughs\u201d) began to take a more noticeably modern and democratic form.\n\n===Public welfare reforms===\nDuring the industrial revolution there were massive population increases, massively increased urbanisation (especially in previously unimportant towns), and the creation of an urban poor, who had no means of subsistence. This created many new problems that the small-scale local government apparatus existing in England could not cope with. Between 1832 and 1888, several laws were passed to try and address these problems.\n\nIn 1837 laws were passed allowing rural parishes to group together as [[Poor Law Union]]s, in order to administer the [[Poor Law]] more effectively; these unions were able to collect taxes (\u201crates\u201d) in order to carry out poor-relief. Each union was run by a [[Board of Guardians]], partly elected but also including local Justices of the Peace. In 1866, all land which was not part of ecclesiastical parishes was formed into Civil Parishes for administration of the poor law. In the municipal boroughs the poor law was administered by the town corporation.\n\nIn 1848, a [[Public Health Act 1848|Public Health Act]] was passed, establishing a [[Local Board of Health]] in towns, to regulate sewerage and the spread of diseases. In municipal boroughs, the town corporation selected the board; in other urban areas, the rate-payers elected the boards. Although the boards had legal powers, they were non-governmental organisations.\n\nIn 1873 and 1875, further Public Health Acts ([[Public Health Act 1873]] & [[Public Health Act 1875]]) were passed, which established new quasi-governmental organisations to administer both the poor law, and public health and sanitation. Urban [[sanitary districts]] were created from the Local Boards of Health, and continued to be run by in similar fashion. Rural sanitary districts were created from the Poor Law Unions, and, again were similarly governed.\n\n===Expansion of the franchise===\nIn local government elections, single women [[ratepayer]]s received the right to vote in the Municipal Franchise Act 1869. This right was confirmed in the [[Local Government Act 1894]] and extended to include some married women.<ref name=\"Heater2006\">{{cite book|last1=Heater|first1=Derek|title=Citizenship in Britain: A History|date=2006|publisher=Edinburgh University Press |isbn=9780748626724|page=136|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=js-qBgAAQBAJ&pg=PA136}}</ref><ref name=\"Women's rights\">{{cite web|title=Women's rights|url=http://www.nationalarchives.gov.uk/pathways/citizenship/brave_new_world/women.htm|publisher=The National Archives|accessdate=11 February 2015}}</ref><ref name=Synonym>{{cite web|title=Which Act Gave Women the Right to Vote in Britain?|url=http://classroom.synonym.com/act-gave-women-right-vote-britain-5469.html|website=Synonym|accessdate=11 February 2015}}</ref>\n\n===The Local Government Act 1888===\n[[Image:England Administrative 1931.jpg|thumb|400px|right|Administrative map of [[England]] in 1931.]]\nBy 1888, it was clear that the piecemeal system that had developed over the previous century in response to the vastly increased need for local administration could no longer cope. The sanitary districts and parish councils had legal status, but were not part of the mechanism of government. They were run by volunteers; often there was no-one who could be held responsible for the failure to undertake the required duties. Furthermore, the increased \"county business\" could not be handled by the Quarter Sessions, nor was it appropriate to do so. Finally, there was a desire to see local administration performed by elected officials, as in the reformed municipal boroughs. The [[Local Government Act 1888|Local Government Act]] was therefore the first systematic attempt to impose a standardised system of local government in England\n\nThe counties of England at the time (now known as the [[Historic counties of England|historic counties]], since the major boundary changes of 1974) were used as the basis of the system. The counties themselves had undergone some boundary changes in the preceding 50 years, mainly to remove [[Historic counties of England#Detached parts|enclaves and exclaves]]. The act called for the creation of statutory counties, based on the ancient/historic counties, but completely corrected for enclaves and exclaves, and adjusted so that all settlements were completely within a single county. These statutory counties were to be used for non-administrative functions: \"[[high sheriff|sheriff]], [[lord lieutenant|lieutenant]], [[custos rotulorum]], justices, militia, coroner, or other\". With the advent of elected councils, the offices of lord lieutenant and sheriff became largely ceremonial.\n\nThe statutory counties formed the basis for the so-called \u201cadministrative counties\u201d. However, it was felt that large cities and primarily rural areas in the same county could not be well administered by the same body. Thus 59 \u201ccounties in themselves\u201d, or \u201ccounty boroughs\u201d, were created to administer the urban centres of England. These were part of the statutory counties, but not part of the administrative counties. The qualifying limit for county borough status was a population of 50,000, although some historic county towns were given county borough status despite lower populations (e.g., [[Canterbury]], [[Oxford]]). Each county borough and administrative county would then become governed by an elected county or borough council, providing services specifically for those areas. The act also created a (metropolitan) [[County of London]] from the urban areas (\u201cmetropolis\u201d) of London, which was a full statutory county by itself. This county absorbed the [[Metropolitan Board of Works]], which had been established in 1855 specifically to maintain the infrastructure of London.\n\nBy this time, many towns possessed liberties and franchises from royal charters and grants which were anomalous, obsolete or otherwise irrelevant, but nevertheless often cherished by the townspeople. Some of these towns were municipal boroughs, in which case the powers remained with the municipal corporation. However, there were others (such as the towns of the [[Cinque Ports]]) which were not boroughs. Rather than abolish these rights and powers, the act directed that the powers should be taken over by the new county council; these powers would now be vested in the county (or county borough) council. Although counties corporate were not abolished by the act, their administration was taken over by their parent administrative county (or county borough). The Act therefore abolished them in all but name; they were however still able to appoint their own sheriffs, and describe themselves and 'county and city', both purely ceremonial privileges.\n\nA second Act in 1894 ([[Local Government Act 1894]]) also created a second tier of local government. Henceforth, all administrative counties and county boroughs would be divided into either rural or urban districts, allowing more localised administration. The municipal boroughs reformed after 1835 were brought into this system as special cases of urban districts. The urban and rural districts were based upon, and incorporated the [[sanitary district]]s which had been created in 1875 (with adjustments, so that districts did not overlap two counties).\n\nThe Act also provided for the establishment of [[civil parishes]]. The 1894 Act formed an official system of civil parishes, separated from the ecclesiastical parishes, to carry on some of these responsibilities (others being transferred to the district/county councils). However, the civil parishes were not a complete third-tier of local government. Instead, they were 'community councils' for smaller, rural settlements, which did not have a local government district to themselves. The act automatically created them in all settlements with more than 300 residents in rural districts; settlements with between 100-300 residents could apply to form a civil parish. Where urban parish councils had previously existed, they were absorbed into the new urban districts.\n\nA final relevant piece of legislation, the [[London Government Act 1899]], divided the new [[County of London]] into districts, (rather confusingly) known as [[Metropolitan Borough]]s.\n\n===Attempts at reform (1945-1974)===\nInitially the new administrative system worked quite well, and several more county boroughs were created in the next decades. However, from 1926 the population requirement increased to 75,000. There was also some concern about the viability of some county boroughs which had declined since 1888. For instance, viability of the county borough of Merthyr Tydfil came into question in the 1930s. Due to [[Merthyr Tydfil#The decline of coal and iron|a decline in the heavy industries]] of the town, by 1932 more than half the male population was unemployed, resulting in very high municipal rates in order to make public assistance payments. At the same time the population of the borough was lower than when it had been created in 1908.<ref>[http://www.visionofbritain.org.uk/data_cube_table_page.jsp?data_theme=T_POP&data_cube=N_TPop&u_id=10243646&c_id=10001043&add=N Census data on population of Merthyr Tydfil]</ref> A [[royal commission]] was appointed in May 1935 to \"investigate whether the existing status of Merthyr Tydfil as a county borough should be continued, and if not, what other arrangements should be made\".<ref>London Gazette, 1 May 1935</ref> The commission reported the following November, and recommended that Merthyr should revert to the status of a non-county borough, and that public assistance should be taken over by central government. In the event county borough status was retained by the town, with the chairman of the Welsh Board of Health appointed as administrative adviser in 1936.<ref>Report of the Royal Commission on the status of the County Borough of Merthyr Tydfil (Cmd.5039)</ref>\n\nAfter the [[Second World War]] the creation of new county boroughs in [[England and Wales]] was effectively suspended, pending a local government review. A government [[white paper]] published in 1945 stated that \"it is expected that there will be a number of Bills for extending or creating county boroughs\" and proposed the creation of a boundary commission to bring coordination to local government reform. The policy in the paper also ruled out the creation of new county boroughs in [[Middlesex]] \"owing to its special problems\".<ref>''Local government in England and Wales during the period of reconstruction'' (Cmd.6579)</ref> The [[Local Government Boundary Commission (1945 -1949)|Local Government Boundary Commission]] was appointed on 26 October 1945, under the chairmanship of Sir [[Malcolm Eve|Malcolm Trustram Eve]],<ref>London Gazette, 26 October 1945</ref> delivering its report in 1947.<ref>Report of the Local Government Boundary Commission for the year 1947</ref> The Commission recommended that towns with a population of 200,000 or more should become one-tier \"new counties\", with \"new county boroughs\" having a population of 60,000 - 200,000 being \"most-purpose authorities\", with the county council of the administrative county providing certain limited services. The report envisaged the creation of 47 two-tiered \"new counties\", 21 one-tiered \"new counties\" and 63 \"new county boroughs\". The recommendations of the Commission extended to a review of the division of functions between different tiers of local government, and thus fell outside its terms of reference, and its report was not acted upon.\n\nThe next attempt at reform was by the Local Government Act 1958, which established the [[Local Government Commission for England (1958 - 1967)|Local Government Commission for England]] and the [[Local Government Commission for Wales]] to carry out reviews of existing local government structures and recommend reforms. Although the Commissions did not complete their work before being dissolved, a few new county boroughs were constituted between 1964 and 1968.  [[Luton]], [[Torbay]], and [[Solihull]] gained county borough status. Additionally, [[Teesside]] county borough was formed from the merger of the existing county borough of [[Middlesbrough]], and the non-county boroughs of [[Stockton-on-Tees]] and [[Redcar]]; [[County Borough of Warley|Warley]] was formed from the county borough of [[Smethwick]] and the non-county boroughs of [[Oldbury, West Midlands|Oldbury]] and [[Rowley Regis]]; and [[West Hartlepool]] was merged with [[Hartlepool]]. Following these changes, there were a total of 79 county boroughs in England. The Commission also recommended the downgrading of [[Barnsley]] to be a non-county borough, but this was not carried out. The commission did succeed in merging two pairs of small administrative counties to form [[Huntingdon and Peterborough]] and [[Cambridgeshire and Isle of Ely]].\n\nIn 1965, a major reform in London was undertaken in reflection of the size, and specific problems of London. The counties of London and Middlesex were abolished and along with parts of Essex, Surrey and Kent, formed into a new county of [[Greater London]]. This also resulted in the abolition of several county boroughs in the London area, and Greater London was thereafter divided into 32 metropolitan boroughs. This reform provided some the basis for the next major nationwide reform in 1974, although other options were seriously considered.\n\nThe Local Government Commission was wound up in 1966, and replaced with a Royal Commission (known as the [[Redcliffe-Maud Report|Redcliffe-Maud commission]]). In 1969 it recommended a system of single-tier [[unitary authorities]] for the whole of England, apart from three metropolitan areas of [[Merseyside]], [[Greater Manchester|Selnec]] (Greater Manchester) and [[West Midlands (county)|West Midlands]] ([[Birmingham]] and the [[Black Country]]), which were to have both a metropolitan council and district councils. This report was accepted by the [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]] government of the time despite considerable opposition, but the [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative Party]] won the [[1970 United Kingdom general election|June 1970 general election]], and on a manifesto that committed them to a two-tier structure.\n\n===The Local Government Act (1972)===\n[[Image:England Administrative 1974.png|thumb|400px|right|Administrative map of [[England]] in 1974.]]\n{{Further|Local Government Act 1972}}\n\nThe reforms arising from the Local Government Act of 1972 resulted in the most uniform and simplified system of local government which has been used in England. They effectively wiped away everything that had gone before, and built an administrative system from scratch. All previous administrative districts - statutory counties, administrative counties, county boroughs, municipal boroughs, counties corporate, civil parishes - were abolished, with the exceptions of Greater London and the Isles of Scilly.\n\nThe aim of the act was to establish a uniform two tier system across the country. Onto the blank canvas, new counties were created to cover the entire country; many of these were obviously based on the [[Historic counties of England|historic counties]], but there were some major changes, especially in the north. The tiny county of [[Rutland]] was joined with [[Leicestershire]]; [[Cumberland]], [[Westmorland]] and the [[Furness]] exclave of [[Lancashire]] were fused into the new county of Cumbria; [[Herefordshire]] and [[Worcestershire]] were joined to form [[Hereford & Worcester]]; the three ridings of [[Yorkshire]] were replaced by [[North Yorkshire|North]], [[South Yorkshire|South]] and [[West Yorkshire]], along with [[Humberside]]. The act also created six new 'metropolitan' counties, modelled on [[Greater London]], to specifically address the problems of administering large conurbations; these were [[Greater Manchester]], [[Merseyside]], [[Tyne & Wear]], [[West Yorkshire]], [[South Yorkshire]] and [[West Midlands (county)|West Midlands]]. The new counties of [[Avon (county)|Avon]] (the city of [[Bristol]], north [[Somerset]] and south [[Gloucestershire]]), [[Cleveland, England|Cleveland]] (the [[Teesside]] area) and [[Humberside]] were designed with the idea of uniting areas based on river estuaries.\n\nEach of the new counties was then endowed with a county council, to generally administer the county, and provide certain county-wide services, such as policing, social services and public transport. The Act substituted the new counties \"for counties of any other description\" for purposes of law.<ref>Local Government Act 1972 (c.70), s.216</ref>  The new counties therefore replaced the statutory counties created in 1888 for judicial and ceremonial purposes (such as [[Lord-Lieutenant|lieutenancy]], [[custos rotulorum|custodes rotulorum]], [[High Sheriff|shrievalty]], [[commission of the peace|commissions of the peace]] and [[magistrate|magistrates']] courts);<ref>Elcock, H., ''Local Government'', (1994)</ref><ref>Her Majesty's Stationery Office, ''Aspects of Britain: Local Government'', (1996)</ref> and replaced administrative counties and county boroughs for administrative purposes.\n\nThe second tier of the local government varied between the metropolitan and non-metropolitan counties. The metropolitan counties were divided into [[metropolitan boroughs]], whilst the non-metropolitan counties were divided into districts. The metropolitan boroughs had greater powers than the districts, sharing some of the county council responsibilities with the metropolitan county councils, and having control of others that districts did not (e.g. education was administered by the non-metropolitan county councils, but by the metropolitan borough councils). The metropolitan boroughs were supposed to have a minimum population of 250,000 and districts 40,000; in practice some exceptions were allowed for the sake of convenience.\n\nWhere municipal boroughs still existed, they were dissolved. However, the charter grants made to those boroughs (where transfer had not already occurred), were generally transferred to the district or metropolitan borough which contained area in question. Districts which succeeded to such powers were permitted to style themselves 'borough councils' as opposed to 'district councils' - however, the difference was purely ceremonial. The powers of some municipal boroughs were transferred to either civil parish councils, or to charter trustees; see [[Borough status in the United Kingdom]] for details.\n\nThe act also dealt with [[civil parishes]]. These were maintained in rural areas, but those existing in large urban areas were abolished. Conversely, the Act actually provided the legislation such that the whole country could be divided into parishes if this was desirable at some point in the future. However, at the time urban parishes were strongly discouraged. However, since 1974, several urban areas have applied for and received parish councils. Much of the country remains unparished, since the parish councils are not a necessary part of local government, but exist to give civic identity to smaller settlements.\n\nThe new system of local government came into force on 1 April 1974, but in the event the uniformity proved to be short lived.\n\n==Further reform (1974-)==\n===Abolition of the metropolitan county councils===\nThis uniform two-tier system lasted only 12 years. In 1986, the metropolitan county councils and Greater London were abolished under the [[Local Government Act 1985]]. This restored autonomy (in effect the old county borough status) to the metropolitan and London boroughs. While the abolition of the Greater London Council was highly controversial, the abolition of the MCCs was less so. The government's stated reason for the abolition of the MCCs, in its 1983 white paper ''[[Streamlining the cities]]'', was based on efficiency and their overspending. However the fact that all of the county councils were controlled at the time by the opposition Labour Party led to accusations that their abolition was motivated by party politics: the general secretary of [[NALGO]] described it as a \"completely cynical manoeuvre\".<ref name=angry_reaction>''Angry reaction to councils White Paper''.

The metropolitan counties thus continued to exist as geographical entities, and lived a shadowy semi-existence, since services such as the police force continued to call themselves e.g. 'Greater Manchester Police'. This gave rise to the concept of the '[[ceremonial county]]'. From a geographical and ceremonial point of view, England continues to be made up of the counties established in 1974, with one or two exceptions (see below). These counties still have a lord lieutenant and sheriff, and are therefore usually referred to as ceremonial counties.\n\n===Local Government Act (1992)===\n{{Further|Local Government Commission for England (1992)}}\n{{Further|Ceremonial Counties of England}}\n\nBy the 1990s, it was apparent that the 'one-size fits all' approach of the 1974 reforms did not work equally well in all cases. The consequent loss of education, social services and libraries to county control, was strongly regretted by the larger towns outside the new [[metropolitan county|metropolitan counties]], such as Bristol, Plymouth, Stoke, Leicester and Nottingham.<ref name=reformed>{{cite book|last=Redcliffe-Maud|first=Lord|others=Wood, Bruce|title=English Local Government Reformed|url=https://archive.org/details/englishlocalgove0000redc|url-access=registration|year=1974|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=0-19-888091-X}}</ref><ref name=process>{{cite book|last=Wood|first=Bruce|title=The Process of Local Government Reform: 1966-1974|year=1976|publisher=George Allen & Unwin|isbn=0-04-350052-8}}</ref>  The abolition of metropolitan county councils in 1986 had left the metropolitan boroughs operating as 'unitary' (i.e., only one tier) authorities, and other large cities (and former county boroughs) wished for a return to unitary governance.\n\n[[Image:EnglandSubdivisions1998 rainbow.png|thumb|200px|Map showing counties and unitary authorities from 1998. Pink (non-metropolitan) and green (metropolitan and London) areas were left unchanged. Yellow areas are unitary authorities created as a result of the review, whilst blue areas are remaining two-tier counties reduced by the creation of unitary authorities.]]\n\nThe Local Government Act (1992) established a commission ([[Local Government Commission for England (1992)|Local Government Commission for England]]) to examine the issues, and make recommendations on where unitary authorities should be established. It was considered too expensive to make the system entirely unitary, and also there would doubtlessly be cases where the two-tier system functioned well. The commission recommended that many counties be moved to completely unitary systems; that some cities become unitary authorities, but that the remainder of their parent counties remain two-tier; and that in some counties the ''status quo'' should remain.\n\nThe first major changes to be recommended were for unpopular new counties created in 1974. Three of these had artificially united the areas around rivers/estuaries ([[Cleveland, England|Cleveland]], [[Humberside]] and [[Avon (county)|Avon]]), and the commission recommended that they be split into four new unitary authorities. This effectively gave a 'metropolitan borough-like' status to the cities of [[Kingston upon Hull|Hull]], [[Bristol]] and [[Middlesbrough]]. It also restored the [[East Riding of Yorkshire]] as a ''de facto'' county. [[Rutland]] was reestablished as a unitary authority, thus regaining its cherished 'independence' from Leicestershire. The merged county of [[Hereford & Worcester]] was restored to [[Herefordshire]] (as a unitary authority) and [[Worcestershire]] (as a two-tier authority).\n\nThe only other county to be moved to a wholly unitary system was [[Berkshire]]; the county council was abolished and 6 unitary authorities established in its place. In [[County Durham]], [[North Yorkshire]], [[Lancashire]], [[Cheshire]], [[Staffordshire]], [[Nottinghamshire]], [[Derbyshire]], [[Leicestershire]], [[Cambridgeshire]], [[Wiltshire]], [[Hampshire]], [[Devon]], [[Dorset]], [[East Sussex]], [[Shropshire]], [[Kent]], [[Essex]], [[Bedfordshire]] and [[Buckinghamshire]], one or two major towns/cities were established as unitary authorities, with the rest of the county remaining two tier. All other counties were unaffected.\n\nWhilst these reforms had removed unpopular new counties, they created a rather haphazard situation, which was for the most part like the old counties & county borough system; but in which areas taken to make the abolished new counties was not returned to the historic county. Thus, for instance, the non-urban unitary authority of, e.g., [[Cleveland]] & [[Redcar]] was not, administratively, in any county. In recognition of these problems, the [[Lieutenancies Act 1997]] was passed. This firmly separated all local authority areas (whether unitary or two-tier), from the geographical concept of a county as  high level spatial unit. The lieutenancies it established became known as [[ceremonial counties]], since they were no longer administrative divisions. The counties represent a compromise between the [[historic counties of England|historic counties]] and the counties established in 1974. They are as 1974 except that; north Lincolnshire returned to [[Lincolnshire]] and the remainder of Humberside became East Riding of Yorkshire; Bristol is established as a county; the remainder of Avon returned to [[Somerset]] and [[Gloucestershire]]; Cleveland was split between County Durham and North Yorkshire; Herefordshire and Worcestershire were separated; and Rutland was re-established as a county.\n\n===Creation of additional unitary authorities after 2000===\nThe years after 2000 saw further substantial changes, leading to a still more varied (some might say haphazard) system. Various Counties were made into unitary authorities: some by abolition of Districts (e.g. Cornwall, Northumberland), others by geographical division into two or more unitaries (e.g. Bedfordshire).\n \nThe Labour government (1997\u20132010) of the United Kingdom had planned to introduce eight regional assemblies around England, to devolve power to the regions. This would have sat alongside the devolved [[Welsh Assembly|Welsh]], [[Scottish Assembly|Scottish]] and [[Northern Ireland Assembly|Northern Irish]] Assemblies. In the event, only a [[London Assembly]] (and directly elected [[Mayor]]) was established. Rejection in a referendum of a proposed North-East Assembly in 2004 effectively scrapped those plans.\n\n===Local enterprise partnerships and local authority leaders' boards===\nThe abolition of [[regional development agency|regional development agencies]] and the creation of [[local enterprise partnership]]s were announced as part of the [[June 2010 United Kingdom budget]].<ref name=\"Budget June 2010\">{{cite book | url=http://www.direct.gov.uk/prod_consum_dg/groups/dg_digitalassets/@dg/@en/documents/digitalasset/dg_188581.pdf | date=22 June 2010 | accessdate=7 October 2010 | publisher=HM Treasury | author=Mark Hoban | title=Budget 2010 | archive-url=http://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/20121015000000/http://www.direct.gov.uk/prod_consum_dg/groups/dg_digitalassets/%40dg/%40en/documents/digitalasset/dg_188581.pdf | archive-date=15 October 2012 | url-status=dead }}</ref> On 29 June 2010 a letter was sent from the [[Department of Communities and Local Government]] and the [[Department for Business, Innovation and Skills]] to local authority and business leaders, inviting proposals to replace regional development agencies in their areas by 6 September 2010.<ref name=\"DCLG 1626854\">{{ cite web | url= http://www.communities.gov.uk/localgovernment/local/localenterprisepartnerships/ | title= Local enterprise partnerships | author= | publisher=Department of Communities and Local Government | date=29 June 2010 | accessdate=7 October 2010 }}</ref>\n\nMany of the [[regional development agency|regional development agencies]] were transferred to the unelected [[Local authority leaders' board]]s following abolition in March 2010, but funding was also cut for them by the Government in July 2010.

In 2010 the Government accepted a proposal from the [[Association of Greater Manchester Authorities]] to establish a Greater Manchester Combined Authority as an indirectly elected, top tier, strategic authority for [[Greater Manchester]]. Following the unsuccessful [[2012 English mayoral referendums|English mayoral referendums]] in 2012 combined authorities have been used as an alternative means to receive additional powers and funding as part of 'city deals' to metropolitan areas. In 2014 indirectly elected combined authorities were established for the metropolitan counties of [[South Yorkshire]] and [[West Yorkshire]], and two combined authorities were established which each covered a metropolitan county and adjacent non-metropolitan districts:  the [[Liverpool City Region Combined Authority]] for [[Merseyside]] and the [[Borough of Halton]] unitary authority, and the [[North East Combined Authority]] for [[Tyne and Wear]] and the unitary authorities of [[County Durham]] and [[Northumberland]].  Further combined authorities are proposed for a number of areas.\n\n==The City of London==\n{{Further|City of London}}\n\nThe one exception to the general trends in the development of local government in England has been (and remains) the City of London. This refers only to the actual City of London (as distinct from the Greater London area, and the nearby [[City of Westminster]]). In the UK, [[City status in the United Kingdom|city status]] is granted by royal charter; whilst in common parlance 'city' (lower case) is used to mean a large urban area, 'City' refers specifically to a specific legal entity. Thus, what might be considered the 'city of London' contains both the 'City of London' and 'City of Westminster'. The City of London, covering a relatively small area, (often called 'The Square Mile' or just 'The City') is the main financial district of London, and only houses c.7,200 permanent residents.\n\nFor a variety of reasons, including a singular relationship with the Crown, the City of London has remained an archaic oddity within the English system of local government. As discussed above, the City of London was administered separately from the reign of [[Alfred the Great]] onwards, and was very quickly granted self-governance after the Norman conquest. Until 1835, the City of London was a fairly normal (municipal) [[borough]], run by the [[Lord Mayor of London|Lord Mayor]] and [[Corporation of London]], which had also received [[county corporate]] status (and thus was technically 'The County and City of London'). However, unlike most other cities and boroughs of the time, London was not reformed by the [[Municipal Corporations Act 1835]]; and unlike the other unreformed cities and boroughs of the time, never has been.\n\nIn the major local government reforms of 1888 the City of London, unlike other municipal boroughs and counties corporate, was not made into either a [[county borough]] or a district within an [[administrative county]]. Nor indeed was it placed within a statutory county at that time, remaining administratively separate from the [[County of London]] (though within it geographically). Nor was the status of the City of London as a county corporate abolished in 1974, unlike the (by then ceremonial) status of the other counties corporate, nor was the City of London included in any of the London boroughs created in 1965; although at that time it did become included within the [[Greater London]] county, as a ''de facto'' 33rd borough in the second tier of local government. The City of London has continued in name and administration to be a municipal borough and county corporate since 1888, whilst acting as a ''de facto'' county borough until 1965, and since 1965 as a ''de facto'' London borough.\n\nWhen Greater London Council was abolished in 1986, the City of London reverted to being a unitary authority (like the London boroughs). Under the terms of the [[Lieutenancies Act 1997]], it is now classed as a ceremonial county by itself, separate from the Greater London ceremonial county (in to which the 32 London Boroughs are grouped). However, the City of London does now form part of the new Greater London [[Regions of England|region]] (which is the modern Greater London ceremonial county, plus the City of London; i.e., the post-1965 Greater London administrative area), and as such falls under the strategic management of the [[Greater London Authority]].\n\nThe current system retains non-democratic elements to the election of the local government. The primary justification for this is that the services provided by the City of London are used by approximately 450,000 workers who dwell outside the City, and only by 7200 residents (a ratio not found elsewhere in the UK). In reflection of this, businesses based in the City can [[Plural voting|vote]] in the local elections, a practice abolished elsewhere in England in 1969.<ref>{{cite hansard|house=House of Lords|url=https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/vo060525/wmstext/60525m0001.htm|title=Elections: City of London|date=25 May 2006|column_start=91WS|column_end=92WS}}</ref>\n\n[[File:City of London Ward Map, 1870.svg|thumb|A map of the wards of the City as they were in the late 19th century.]]\nThe City of London has a [[Wards of the City of London|different type of ward]] than used presently elsewhere in the country, another remnant of ancient local government found in the \"square mile\" of the City.

[[England]] has never possessed a formal written [[constitution]], with the result that modern administration (and the judicial system) is based on precedent, and is derived from administrative powers granted (usually by [[the Crown]]) to older systems, such as that of the [[shire]]s.\n\nThe concept of [[local government in England]] spans back into the [[history of Anglo-Saxon England]] (c. 700-1066), and certain aspects of its modern system are directly derived from this time; particularly the paradigm that towns and the countryside should be administrated separately. In this context, the [[feudalism|feudal system]] introduced by the [[Normans]], and perhaps lasting 300 years, can be seen as a 'blip', before earlier patterns of administration re-emerged.\n\nThe dramatic increase in population, and change in population distribution caused by the [[Industrial Revolution]] necessitated similarly dramatic reform in local administration in England, which was achieved gradually throughout the 19th century. Much of the 20th century was spent searching for an idealised system of local government. The most sweeping change in that period was the [[Local Government Act 1972]], which resulted in a uniform two-tier system of counties and districts being introduced in 1974; however, further waves of reform have led to a more heterogeneous system in use today.\n\n==Origins of local government in England==\n{{Refimprove|original research|date=March 2020}}\nMuch of the basic structure of local government in [[England]] is derived directly from the [[Kingdom of England]] (which became part of the [[Kingdom of Great Britain]] in 1707 then later part of the [[United Kingdom]]). There are thus aspects of the modern system which are not shared with the other constituent parts of the UK, namely [[Scotland]], [[Wales]] and [[Northern Ireland]].\n\nThe Kingdom of England was by origin an extension of the [[Anglo-Saxons|Saxon]] [[Wessex|Kingdom of Wessex]] into the other regions, supplanting amongst others the former kingdoms of [[Mercia]], [[Northumbria]] and [[Kingdom of East Anglia]], and unifying the [[Anglo-Saxons|Anglo-Saxon peoples]] of the [[British Isles]]. Some of the basic elements of modern local government therefore derive from the ancient system of Wessex.\n\n===Anglo-Saxon local government (700\u20131066 AD)===\nThe [[Kingdom of Wessex]], c. 790 AD, was divided into administrative units known as [[shire]]s. Each shire was governed by an [[Ealdorman]], a major nobleman of Wessex appointed to the post by the King. The term 'Ealdorman' (meaning 'elder-man') gradually merged with the Scandinavian Eorl/Jarl (designating an important chieftain), to form the modern 'Earl'. However, the Shires were not comparable with later [[Earldoms]], and were not held in the Ealdorman's own right.\n\nThe shires of Wessex at this time have essentially survived to the present day, as [[County|counties]] of England (currently [[ceremonial counties]]). They included Defnascir ([[Devon]]), Sumorsaete ([[Somerset]]), Dornsaete ([[Dorset]]), Wiltunscir ([[Wiltshire]]), Hamptunscir ([[Hampshire]]). When Wessex conquered the petty kingdoms of southern England, namely [[Kingdom of Kent|Cent]] and that of the [[Kingdom of Sussex|South Saxons]], these were simply reconstituted as shires (modern [[Kent]] and [[Sussex]] respectively).\n\nAs Wessex took over progressively larger areas of Mercia, East Anglia and Northumbria, the new lands were divided into shires, usually named after the principal town in the new shire; hence [[Northamptonshire]], [[Oxfordshire]], [[Derbyshire]] and so on. Most of the [[Historic counties of England|historic counties]] of England (and modern [[Ceremonial counties]]) south of the [[Mersey]] and [[Humber]] derive directly from this time.\n\nAnother important official of the shire was the shire-reeve, from whence the more modern [[sheriff]] is derived. The shire-reeve was responsible for upholding the law, and holding civil and criminal courts in the shire.<ref>W. Blackstone, COMMENTARIES ON THE LAWS OF ENGLAND 339, 343 (1541)</ref> The office of sheriff is still important in some Anglophone countries (e.g. the USA), but now a ceremonial role in England.\n\nBelow the level of the shire, the Anglo-Saxon system was very different from the later systems of local government. The shire was divided into an unlimited number of [[Hundred (administrative division)|hundreds]] (or [[Hundred (administrative division)|wapentakes]] in the [[Danelaw]] counties of [[Yorkshire]], [[Derbyshire]], [[Leicestershire]], [[Northamptonshire]], [[Nottinghamshire]], [[Rutland]] and [[Lincolnshire]]). Each hundred consisted of 10 groups of 10 households. A group of 10 households was a [[Tithing (country subdivision)|tithing]] and each household held one [[Hide (unit)|hide]] of land. The hide was an arbitrary unit of land which was deemed able to support one household, and thus could vary in size. The whole hundred system was thus both very flexible and fluid, varying with changes in population etc.\n\nHundreds were led by a 'hundred-man', and had their own 'hundred' courts. The members of the hundreds (or tithings, etc.) were collectively held responsible for each individuals conduct, thereby decentralising the administration of justice upon the people themselves. Hundreds were used as administrative units for the raising of armies, collection of taxes and so forth.\n\n===The Norman conquest (1066\u20131100)===\n[[File:DomesdayEnglandMap.png|England in 1086 showing hundreds, wapentakes and wards|thumb|upright=2.0|right]]\nThe conquest of England by the [[Normans]] in 1066 brought about many changes in the local administration of the country, but some aspects were retained. One of the biggest changes was the introduction of a severe feudal system by the Normans. Although [[Anglo-Saxons|Anglo-Saxon]] society had also been essentially [[feudal]] in character, the Norman system was much more rigid, centralised and thorough. [[William the Conqueror]] claimed ultimate possession of virtually all the land in England and asserted the right to dispose of it as he saw fit. Thenceforth, all land was \"held\" from the King.<ref>Carpenter, D. (2004) The Struggle for Mastery: Britain 1066-1284, Penguin history of Britain, London : Penguin, {{ISBN|0-14-014824-8}} pp. 81, 84, 86.</ref> The country was divided up into fiefs which William distributed amongst his followers. The [[fiefdom|fiefs]] were generally small and given out piecemeal, to deprive William's vassals of large power-bases.\n\nSince each fiefdom was governed more or less independently of each other by the feudal lords, the Anglo-Saxon [[shire]] system became less important. However, the system did continue in use. The shires (referred to by the Normans as 'counties', in analogy to the system in use in medieval France) remained the major geographical division of England. North of the Humber, the Normans reorganised the shires to form one new large county, that of [[Yorkshire]]. Immediately after the conquest the rest of northern England does not seem to have been in Norman hands; as the remainder of England came under Norman rule it too was also constituted into new counties (e.g. [[Lancashire]], [[Northumberland]]) In the period immediately after the Norman conquest, hundreds also remained as the basic administrative unit. In the [[Domesday Book]], the great Norman work of bureaucracy, the survey is taken shire by shire, and hundred by hundred. At this time, if not before, hundreds must have become more static units of land, since the more fluid nature of the original system would not have been compatible with the rigid feudal system of the Normans. Although hundreds continued to alter in size and number after the Domesday Book, they became more permanent administrative divisions, rather than groups of households.\n\n===The medieval period (1100\u20131300)===\nDuring the medieval period, local administration basically remained in the hands of the feudal aristocracy, who governed affairs in their fiefs. The enserfment of the population by the Norman system diminished the importance of hundreds as self-regulating [[social unit]]s since law was not imposed from above, and since the population was immobilised. Instead the basic [[social unit]] became the [[parish]], [[manorialism|manor]] or [[township]].\n\nThe counties remained important as the basis for the legal system. The sheriff remained the paramount legal officer in each county, and each county eventually had its own court system for trials (the [[Quarter Sessions]]). Although the Hundred Courts continued in use resolving local disputes, they diminished in importance. During the reigns of Henry III, Edward I and Edward II a new system emerged. Knights in each county were appointed as [[Conservator of the Peace]], being required to help keep the King's Peace. Eventually they were given the right to try petty offences which had formerly been tried in the Hundred Courts. These officers were the forerunners of the modern [[Magistrates' Court (England and Wales)|magistrates' court]]s and [[justices of the peace]].\n\n====The rise of the town====\nThe feudal system introduced by the Normans was designed to govern rural areas which could easily be controlled by a lord. Since the system was based upon the exploitation of the labour and produce of enserfed peasant farmers, the system was unsuited to governing larger towns, where more complex economic activity was required. At the time of the Norman conquest true urban centres were few in England, but during the early medieval period a growing population and increased mercantile activity led to an increase in the importance of towns.\n\nLondon, by far the largest settlement in England during the medieval period, had been marked out for special status as early as the reign of [[Alfred the Great]]. William the Conqueror granted London a royal charter in 1075, confirming some of the autonomy and privileges that the city had accumulated during the Saxon period. The charter gave London self-governing status, paying taxes directly to the king in return for remaining outside the feudal system. The citizens were therefore 'burgesses' rather than serfs, and in effect free men. William's son [[Henry I of England|Henry I]] granted charters to other towns, often to establish market towns.\n\nHowever, it was [[Henry II of England|Henry II]] who greatly expanded the separation of towns from the countryside. He granted around 150 royal charters to towns around England, which were thereafter referred to as '[[borough]]s'.<ref>[http://www.bedford.gov.uk/Default.aspx/Web/TheRoyalCharter The Royal Charter<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> For an annual rent to the crown, the towns were given various privileges, such as the exemption from feudal dues, the right to hold a market and the rights to levy certain taxes. It should be noted however, that not all market towns established during this period were self-governing.\n\nThe self-governing boroughs are the first recognisably modern aspect of local government in England. Generally they were run by a town [[corporation]], made up of council [[aldermen]], the town 'elders'. Although each corporation was different, they were usually self-elected, new members being co-opted by the existing members. A [[mayor]] was often elected by the council to serve for a given period. The idea of a town council to run the affairs of an individual town remains an important tenet of local government in England today.\n\n====Political representation====\nThe [[Parliament of England|English Parliament]] developed during the 13th century, and would eventually become the ''de facto'' governing body for the country. In 1297, it was decreed that the representatives to the [[House of Commons of the United Kingdom|House of Commons]] would be allocated based on the administrative units of counties and boroughs \u2014 two knights from each shire, and two burgesses from each borough. This system would remain essentially unchanged (despite massive increases in population in some non-borough areas, and the decreased importance of some boroughs) until the [[Reform Act of 1832]].\n\n===The medieval period (1300\u20131500)===\n\n====The decline of the feudal system====\nBy the beginning of the 14th century, the feudal system in England was in decline; the [[Black Death]] (1348\u20131350) causing mass depopulation, is widely held to signal the effective end of feudalism. Thereafter the relationship between lord and vassal become more a relationship between landlord and tenant. The breakdown of the feudal power left the shires without ''de jure'' administration. The legal system and sheriffs remained for each county, and what local administration was required was undoubtedly provided by individual parishes or by the local landowners. In an era of very 'small government', the requirement for higher levels of administration was probably minimal. In towns, where more governance would have been required, the town councils continued to manage local affairs.\n\n====Counties corporate====\n{{Main|County corporate}}\nA further extension of the borough system occurred in the later medieval period. While borough status gave towns specific rights ''within'' counties, some cities petitioned for greater independence. Those cities (or towns) were therefore awarded complete effective independence from the county including their own [[sheriff]]s, [[Quarter Sessions]] and other officials, and were sometimes given governing rights over a swath of surrounding countryside. They were referred to in the form \"Town and County of ...\" or \"City and County of ...\", and became known as the counties corporate. They included the City and County of York, Bristol, Canterbury and Chester.\n\nOther counties corporate were created to deal with specific local problems, such as border conflict (in the case of [[Berwick-upon-Tweed]]) and [[piracy]] (in the case of [[Poole]] and [[Haverfordwest]]).\n\n===Later changes in local government (1500\u20131832)===\nIn the 1540s the office of [[Lord Lieutenant]] was instituted in each county, effectively replacing feudal lords as the Crown's direct representative in that county. The lieutenants had a military role, previously exercised by the sheriffs, and were made responsible for raising and organising the county [[militia]]. The county lieutenancies were subsequently given responsibility for the [[Volunteer Force (Great Britain)|Volunteer Force]]. In 1871 the lieutenants lost their position as head of the militia, and the office became largely ceremonial.<ref>Regulation of Forces Act 1871</ref> The [[Cardwell Reforms|Cardwell]] and [[Childers Reforms]] of the [[British Army]] linked the recruiting areas of infantry regiments to the counties.\n\nFrom the 16th century the county was increasingly used as a unit of [[local government]]. Although 'small government' was still the accepted norm, there were an increasing number of responsibilities which could not be fulfilled by individual communities. The justices of the peace therefore took on various administrative functions known as \"county business\". This was transacted at the [[Quarter Sessions]], summoned four times a year by the Lord Lieutenant. By the 19th century the county magistrates exercised powers over the licensing of alehouses, the construction of bridges, prisons and asylums, superintendence of main roads, public buildings and charitable institutions, and the regulation of weights and measures.<ref>Carl H. E. Zangerl, ''The Social Composition of the County Magistracy in England and Wales, 1831\u20131887'', ''The Journal of British Studies'', Vol. 11, No. 1. (November 1971), pp. 113\u201325.</ref> The justices were empowered to levy local taxes to support these activities, and in 1739 these were unified as a single \"county rate\" under the control of a county treasurer.<ref>''An Act for the more easy assessing, collecting and levying of County Rates'', (12 Geo. II c. 29)</ref> In order to build and maintain roads and bridges, a salaried county surveyor was to be appointed.<ref>Bridges Act 1803 (1803 c. 59) and Grand Jury Act 1833 (1833 c. 78)</ref>\n\nThese county functions were attached to the legal system, since this was the only body which acted county-wide at that time. However, in this ''ad hoc'' system the beginnings of county councils, another central element in modern local government, can be observed. The counties themselves remained more-or-less static between the [[Law in Wales Acts]] of 1535\u201342, and the Great Reform Act of 1832.\n\n====Parishes====\nThe ecclesiastical [[parish#England|parishes]] of the Church of England also came to play a ''de jure'' roles in local government from this time. It is probable that this merely confirmed the status quo \u2014 people of rural communities would have taken care of what local administration was required. Although the parishes were in no sense governmental organisations, laws were passed requiring parishes to carry out certain responsibilities. From 1555, parishes were responsible for the upkeep of nearby roads. From 1605 parishes were responsible for administering the [[English Poor Laws|Poor Law]], and were required to collect money for their own poor. The parishes were run by parish councils, known as \"[[vestry#Administrative vestry|vestries]]\", often elected from amongst the rate-payers, but often self-selecting.\n\n==The evolution of modern local government (1832-1974)==\n===The Great Reform Act (1832)===\nThe development of modern government in England began with the [[Reform Act 1832|Great Reform Act]] of 1832. The impetus for this act was provided by corrupt practices in the House of Commons, and by the massive increase in population occurring during the [[Industrial Revolution]]. Boroughs and counties were generally able to send two representatives to the Commons. Theoretically, the honour of electing members of Parliament belonged to the wealthiest and most flourishing towns in the kingdom, thus, boroughs that ceased to be successful could be disenfranchised by the Crown.<ref>Blackstone (1765), p. 168.</ref> In practice, however, many tiny [[hamlet (place)|hamlet]]s became boroughs, especially between the reigns of [[Henry VIII of England|Henry VIII]] and [[Charles II of Great Britain|Charles II]]. Likewise, boroughs that had flourished during the Middle Ages, but had since fallen into decay, were allowed to continue sending representatives to Parliament. The royal prerogative of enfranchising and disfranchising boroughs fell into disuse after the reign of Charles II; as a result, these historical anomalies became set in stone.<ref>May (1896), vol. I, p. 329.</ref>\n\nIn addition, only male owners of [[fee simple|freehold property]] or land worth at least forty shillings in a particular county were entitled to vote in that county; but those who owned property in multiple constituencies could vote in every constituency for which he owned sufficiently valuable property; there was normally no requirement for an individual to actually inhabit a constituency in order to vote there. The size of the English county electorate in 1831 has been estimated at only 200,000.<ref>Phillips and Wetherell (1995), p. 413.</ref> This meant that the very wealthy formed the majority of the electorate and could often vote multiple times. In small boroughs that had fallen into decay, there were often only a handful of eligible voters; these \u201crotten\u201d boroughs were therefore effectively controlled by the local aristocracy.\n\nThe Reform Act (and its successors) attempted to address these issues, by abolishing rotten boroughs (as both constituencies and administrative units), enfranchising the industrial towns as new parliamentary boroughs, increasing the proportion of the population eligible to vote, and ending corrupt practices in parliament. Although this did not directly affect local government, it provided impetus to reform outdated, obsolete and unfair practices elsewhere in government.\n\n===The Municipal Corporations Act (1835)===\nAfter the reform of parliamentary constituencies, the boroughs established by royal charter during the previous seven centuries were reformed by the [[Municipal Corporations Act 1835]]. The Act required members of town councils ([[municipal corporation]]s) in [[England and Wales]] to be elected by [[Rates (tax)|ratepayers]] and councils to publish their financial accounts.\n\nBefore the passing of the Act, the [[municipal borough]]s varied depending upon their charters.  In some boroughs, corporations had become self-perpetuating [[oligarchy|oligarchies]], with membership of the corporation being for life, and vacancies filled by [[co-option]].\n\nThe Act reformed 178 boroughs immediately; there remained more than one hundred [[Unreformed boroughs in England and Wales 1835 - 1886|unreformed boroughs]], which generally either fell into [[desuetude]] or were replaced later under the terms of the Act. The last of these were not reformed or abolished until 1886. The [[City of London]] remains unreformed to the present day. The Act allowed unincorporated towns to petition for incorporation. The industrial towns of the Midlands and North quickly took advantage of this, with [[Birmingham]] and [[Manchester]] becoming boroughs as soon as 1838.  Altogether, [[Boroughs incorporated in England and Wales 1835 - 1882|62 additional boroughs]] were incorporated under the act. With this Act, the boroughs (thereafter \u201cmunicipal boroughs\u201d) began to take a more noticeably modern and democratic form.\n\n===Public welfare reforms===\nDuring the industrial revolution there were massive population increases, massively increased urbanisation (especially in previously unimportant towns), and the creation of an urban poor, who had no means of subsistence. This created many new problems that the small-scale local government apparatus existing in England could not cope with. Between 1832 and 1888, several laws were passed to try and address these problems.\n\nIn 1837 laws were passed allowing rural parishes to group together as [[Poor Law Union]]s, in order to administer the [[Poor Law]] more effectively; these unions were able to collect taxes (\u201crates\u201d) in order to carry out poor-relief. Each union was run by a [[Board of Guardians]], partly elected but also including local Justices of the Peace. In 1866, all land which was not part of ecclesiastical parishes was formed into Civil Parishes for administration of the poor law. In the municipal boroughs the poor law was administered by the town corporation.\n\nIn 1848, a [[Public Health Act 1848|Public Health Act]] was passed, establishing a [[Local Board of Health]] in towns, to regulate sewerage and the spread of diseases. In municipal boroughs, the town corporation selected the board; in other urban areas, the rate-payers elected the boards. Although the boards had legal powers, they were non-governmental organisations.\n\nIn 1873 and 1875, further Public Health Acts ([[Public Health Act 1873]] & [[Public Health Act 1875]]) were passed, which established new quasi-governmental organisations to administer both the poor law, and public health and sanitation. Urban [[sanitary districts]] were created from the Local Boards of Health, and continued to be run by in similar fashion. Rural sanitary districts were created from the Poor Law Unions, and, again were similarly governed.\n\n===Expansion of the franchise===\nIn local government elections, single women [[ratepayer]]s received the right to vote in the Municipal Franchise Act 1869. This right was confirmed in the [[Local Government Act 1894]] and extended to include some married women.<ref name=\"Heater2006\">{{cite book|last1=Heater|first1=Derek|title=Citizenship in Britain: A History|date=2006|publisher=Edinburgh University Press |isbn=9780748626724|page=136|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=js-qBgAAQBAJ&pg=PA136}}</ref><ref name=\"Women's rights\">{{cite web|title=Women's rights|url=http://www.nationalarchives.gov.uk/pathways/citizenship/brave_new_world/women.htm|publisher=The National Archives|accessdate=11 February 2015}}</ref><ref name=Synonym>{{cite web|title=Which Act Gave Women the Right to Vote in Britain?|url=http://classroom.synonym.com/act-gave-women-right-vote-britain-5469.html|website=Synonym|accessdate=11 February 2015}}</ref>\n\n===The Local Government Act 1888===\n[[Image:England Administrative 1931.jpg|thumb|400px|right|Administrative map of [[England]] in 1931.]]\nBy 1888, it was clear that the piecemeal system that had developed over the previous century in response to the vastly increased need for local administration could no longer cope. The sanitary districts and parish councils had legal status, but were not part of the mechanism of government. They were run by volunteers; often there was no-one who could be held responsible for the failure to undertake the required duties. Furthermore, the increased \"county business\" could not be handled by the Quarter Sessions, nor was it appropriate to do so. Finally, there was a desire to see local administration performed by elected officials, as in the reformed municipal boroughs. The [[Local Government Act 1888|Local Government Act]] was therefore the first systematic attempt to impose a standardised system of local government in England\n\nThe counties of England at the time (now known as the [[Historic counties of England|historic counties]], since the major boundary changes of 1974) were used as the basis of the system. The counties themselves had undergone some boundary changes in the preceding 50 years, mainly to remove [[Historic counties of England#Detached parts|enclaves and exclaves]]. The act called for the creation of statutory counties, based on the ancient/historic counties, but completely corrected for enclaves and exclaves, and adjusted so that all settlements were completely within a single county. These statutory counties were to be used for non-administrative functions: \"[[high sheriff|sheriff]], [[lord lieutenant|lieutenant]], [[custos rotulorum]], justices, militia, coroner, or other\". With the advent of elected councils, the offices of lord lieutenant and sheriff became largely ceremonial.\n\nThe statutory counties formed the basis for the so-called \u201cadministrative counties\u201d. However, it was felt that large cities and primarily rural areas in the same county could not be well administered by the same body. Thus 59 \u201ccounties in themselves\u201d, or \u201ccounty boroughs\u201d, were created to administer the urban centres of England. These were part of the statutory counties, but not part of the administrative counties. The qualifying limit for county borough status was a population of 50,000, although some historic county towns were given county borough status despite lower populations (e.g., [[Canterbury]], [[Oxford]]). Each county borough and administrative county would then become governed by an elected county or borough council, providing services specifically for those areas. The act also created a (metropolitan) [[County of London]] from the urban areas (\u201cmetropolis\u201d) of London, which was a full statutory county by itself. This county absorbed the [[Metropolitan Board of Works]], which had been established in 1855 specifically to maintain the infrastructure of London.\n\nBy this time, many towns possessed liberties and franchises from royal charters and grants which were anomalous, obsolete or otherwise irrelevant, but nevertheless often cherished by the townspeople. Some of these towns were municipal boroughs, in which case the powers remained with the municipal corporation. However, there were others (such as the towns of the [[Cinque Ports]]) which were not boroughs. Rather than abolish these rights and powers, the act directed that the powers should be taken over by the new county council; these powers would now be vested in the county (or county borough) council. Although counties corporate were not abolished by the act, their administration was taken over by their parent administrative county (or county borough). The Act therefore abolished them in all but name; they were however still able to appoint their own sheriffs, and describe themselves and 'county and city', both purely ceremonial privileges.\n\nA second Act in 1894 ([[Local Government Act 1894]]) also created a second tier of local government. Henceforth, all administrative counties and county boroughs would be divided into either rural or urban districts, allowing more localised administration. The municipal boroughs reformed after 1835 were brought into this system as special cases of urban districts. The urban and rural districts were based upon, and incorporated the [[sanitary district]]s which had been created in 1875 (with adjustments, so that districts did not overlap two counties).\n\nThe Act also provided for the establishment of [[civil parishes]]. The 1894 Act formed an official system of civil parishes, separated from the ecclesiastical parishes, to carry on some of these responsibilities (others being transferred to the district/county councils). However, the civil parishes were not a complete third-tier of local government. Instead, they were 'community councils' for smaller, rural settlements, which did not have a local government district to themselves. The act automatically created them in all settlements with more than 300 residents in rural districts; settlements with between 100-300 residents could apply to form a civil parish. Where urban parish councils had previously existed, they were absorbed into the new urban districts.\n\nA final relevant piece of legislation, the [[London Government Act 1899]], divided the new [[County of London]] into districts, (rather confusingly) known as [[Metropolitan Borough]]s.\n\n===Attempts at reform (1945-1974)===\nInitially the new administrative system worked quite well, and several more county boroughs were created in the next decades. However, from 1926 the population requirement increased to 75,000. There was also some concern about the viability of some county boroughs which had declined since 1888. For instance, viability of the county borough of Merthyr Tydfil came into question in the 1930s. Due to [[Merthyr Tydfil#The decline of coal and iron|a decline in the heavy industries]] of the town, by 1932 more than half the male population was unemployed, resulting in very high municipal rates in order to make public assistance payments. At the same time the population of the borough was lower than when it had been created in 1908.<ref>[http://www.visionofbritain.org.uk/data_cube_table_page.jsp?data_theme=T_POP&data_cube=N_TPop&u_id=10243646&c_id=10001043&add=N Census data on population of Merthyr Tydfil]</ref> A [[royal commission]] was appointed in May 1935 to \"investigate whether the existing status of Merthyr Tydfil as a county borough should be continued, and if not, what other arrangements should be made\".<ref>London Gazette, 1 May 1935</ref> The commission reported the following November, and recommended that Merthyr should revert to the status of a non-county borough, and that public assistance should be taken over by central government. In the event county borough status was retained by the town, with the chairman of the Welsh Board of Health appointed as administrative adviser in 1936.<ref>Report of the Royal Commission on the status of the County Borough of Merthyr Tydfil (Cmd.5039)</ref>\n\nAfter the [[Second World War]] the creation of new county boroughs in [[England and Wales]] was effectively suspended, pending a local government review. A government [[white paper]] published in 1945 stated that \"it is expected that there will be a number of Bills for extending or creating county boroughs\" and proposed the creation of a boundary commission to bring coordination to local government reform. The policy in the paper also ruled out the creation of new county boroughs in [[Middlesex]] \"owing to its special problems\".<ref>''Local government in England and Wales during the period of reconstruction'' (Cmd.6579)</ref> The [[Local Government Boundary Commission (1945 -1949)|Local Government Boundary Commission]] was appointed on 26 October 1945, under the chairmanship of Sir [[Malcolm Eve|Malcolm Trustram Eve]],<ref>London Gazette, 26 October 1945</ref> delivering its report in 1947.<ref>Report of the Local Government Boundary Commission for the year 1947</ref> The Commission recommended that towns with a population of 200,000 or more should become one-tier \"new counties\", with \"new county boroughs\" having a population of 60,000 - 200,000 being \"most-purpose authorities\", with the county council of the administrative county providing certain limited services. The report envisaged the creation of 47 two-tiered \"new counties\", 21 one-tiered \"new counties\" and 63 \"new county boroughs\". The recommendations of the Commission extended to a review of the division of functions between different tiers of local government, and thus fell outside its terms of reference, and its report was not acted upon.\n\nThe next attempt at reform was by the Local Government Act 1958, which established the [[Local Government Commission for England (1958 - 1967)|Local Government Commission for England]] and the [[Local Government Commission for Wales]] to carry out reviews of existing local government structures and recommend reforms. Although the Commissions did not complete their work before being dissolved, a few new county boroughs were constituted between 1964 and 1968.  [[Luton]], [[Torbay]], and [[Solihull]] gained county borough status. Additionally, [[Teesside]] county borough was formed from the merger of the existing county borough of [[Middlesbrough]], and the non-county boroughs of [[Stockton-on-Tees]] and [[Redcar]]; [[County Borough of Warley|Warley]] was formed from the county borough of [[Smethwick]] and the non-county boroughs of [[Oldbury, West Midlands|Oldbury]] and [[Rowley Regis]]; and [[West Hartlepool]] was merged with [[Hartlepool]]. Following these changes, there were a total of 79 county boroughs in England. The Commission also recommended the downgrading of [[Barnsley]] to be a non-county borough, but this was not carried out. The commission did succeed in merging two pairs of small administrative counties to form [[Huntingdon and Peterborough]] and [[Cambridgeshire and Isle of Ely]].\n\nIn 1965, a major reform in London was undertaken in reflection of the size, and specific problems of London. The counties of London and Middlesex were abolished and along with parts of Essex, Surrey and Kent, formed into a new county of [[Greater London]]. This also resulted in the abolition of several county boroughs in the London area, and Greater London was thereafter divided into 32 metropolitan boroughs. This reform provided some the basis for the next major nationwide reform in 1974, although other options were seriously considered.\n\nThe Local Government Commission was wound up in 1966, and replaced with a Royal Commission (known as the [[Redcliffe-Maud Report|Redcliffe-Maud commission]]). In 1969 it recommended a system of single-tier [[unitary authorities]] for the whole of England, apart from three metropolitan areas of [[Merseyside]], [[Greater Manchester|Selnec]] (Greater Manchester) and [[West Midlands (county)|West Midlands]] ([[Birmingham]] and the [[Black Country]]), which were to have both a metropolitan council and district councils. This report was accepted by the [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]] government of the time despite considerable opposition, but the [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative Party]] won the [[1970 United Kingdom general election|June 1970 general election]], and on a manifesto that committed them to a two-tier structure.\n\n===The Local Government Act (1972)===\n[[Image:England Administrative 1974.png|thumb|400px|right|Administrative map of [[England]] in 1974.]]\n{{Further|Local Government Act 1972}}\n\nThe reforms arising from the Local Government Act of 1972 resulted in the most uniform and simplified system of local government which has been used in England. They effectively wiped away everything that had gone before, and built an administrative system from scratch. All previous administrative districts - statutory counties, administrative counties, county boroughs, municipal boroughs, counties corporate, civil parishes - were abolished, with the exceptions of Greater London and the Isles of Scilly.\n\nThe aim of the act was to establish a uniform two tier system across the country. Onto the blank canvas, new counties were created to cover the entire country; many of these were obviously based on the [[Historic counties of England|historic counties]], but there were some major changes, especially in the north. The tiny county of [[Rutland]] was joined with [[Leicestershire]]; [[Cumberland]], [[Westmorland]] and the [[Furness]] exclave of [[Lancashire]] were fused into the new county of Cumbria; [[Herefordshire]] and [[Worcestershire]] were joined to form [[Hereford & Worcester]]; the three ridings of [[Yorkshire]] were replaced by [[North Yorkshire|North]], [[South Yorkshire|South]] and [[West Yorkshire]], along with [[Humberside]]. The act also created six new 'metropolitan' counties, modelled on [[Greater London]], to specifically address the problems of administering large conurbations; these were [[Greater Manchester]], [[Merseyside]], [[Tyne & Wear]], [[West Yorkshire]], [[South Yorkshire]] and [[West Midlands (county)|West Midlands]]. The new counties of [[Avon (county)|Avon]] (the city of [[Bristol]], north [[Somerset]] and south [[Gloucestershire]]), [[Cleveland, England|Cleveland]] (the [[Teesside]] area) and [[Humberside]] were designed with the idea of uniting areas based on river estuaries.\n\nEach of the new counties was then endowed with a county council, to generally administer the county, and provide certain county-wide services, such as policing, social services and public transport. The Act substituted the new counties \"for counties of any other description\" for purposes of law.<ref>Local Government Act 1972 (c.70), s.216</ref>  The new counties therefore replaced the statutory counties created in 1888 for judicial and ceremonial purposes (such as [[Lord-Lieutenant|lieutenancy]], [[custos rotulorum|custodes rotulorum]], [[High Sheriff|shrievalty]], [[commission of the peace|commissions of the peace]] and [[magistrate|magistrates']] courts);<ref>Elcock, H., ''Local Government'', (1994)</ref><ref>Her Majesty's Stationery Office, ''Aspects of Britain: Local Government'', (1996)</ref> and replaced administrative counties and county boroughs for administrative purposes.\n\nThe second tier of the local government varied between the metropolitan and non-metropolitan counties. The metropolitan counties were divided into [[metropolitan boroughs]], whilst the non-metropolitan counties were divided into districts. The metropolitan boroughs had greater powers than the districts, sharing some of the county council responsibilities with the metropolitan county councils, and having control of others that districts did not (e.g. education was administered by the non-metropolitan county councils, but by the metropolitan borough councils). The metropolitan boroughs were supposed to have a minimum population of 250,000 and districts 40,000; in practice some exceptions were allowed for the sake of convenience.\n\nWhere municipal boroughs still existed, they were dissolved. However, the charter grants made to those boroughs (where transfer had not already occurred), were generally transferred to the district or metropolitan borough which contained area in question. Districts which succeeded to such powers were permitted to style themselves 'borough councils' as opposed to 'district councils' - however, the difference was purely ceremonial. The powers of some municipal boroughs were transferred to either civil parish councils, or to charter trustees; see [[Borough status in the United Kingdom]] for details.\n\nThe act also dealt with [[civil parishes]]. These were maintained in rural areas, but those existing in large urban areas were abolished. Conversely, the Act actually provided the legislation such that the whole country could be divided into parishes if this was desirable at some point in the future. However, at the time urban parishes were strongly discouraged. However, since 1974, several urban areas have applied for and received parish councils. Much of the country remains unparished, since the parish councils are not a necessary part of local government, but exist to give civic identity to smaller settlements.\n\nThe new system of local government came into force on 1 April 1974, but in the event the uniformity proved to be short lived.\n\n==Further reform (1974-)==\n===Abolition of the metropolitan county councils===\nThis uniform two-tier system lasted only 12 years. In 1986, the metropolitan county councils and Greater London were abolished under the [[Local Government Act 1985]]. This restored autonomy (in effect the old county borough status) to the metropolitan and London boroughs. While the abolition of the Greater London Council was highly controversial, the abolition of the MCCs was less so. The government's stated reason for the abolition of the MCCs, in its 1983 white paper ''[[Streamlining the cities]]'', was based on efficiency and their overspending. However the fact that all of the county councils were controlled at the time by the opposition Labour Party led to accusations that their abolition was motivated by party politics: the general secretary of [[NALGO]] described it as a \"completely cynical manoeuvre\".<ref name=angry_reaction>''Angry reaction to councils White Paper''. ''The Times''. 8 October 1983.</ref><ref name=\"Political\">[http://www.politics.co.uk/issuebrief/domestic-policy/local-government/local-government-structure/local-government-structure-$366613.htm politics.co.uk Issue Brief] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071113045315/http://www.politics.co.uk/issuebrief/domestic-policy/local-government/local-government-structure/local-government-structure-%24366613.htm |date=13 November 2007 }} and [http://jonathan.rawle.org/hyperpedia/counties/history.php Jonathan Rawle's website] refer.</ref> This created an unusual situation where seven counties had, administratively, ceased to exist, but the area had not been annexed to any other county. The metropolitan counties thus continued to exist as geographical entities, and lived a shadowy semi-existence, since services such as the police force continued to call themselves e.g. 'Greater Manchester Police'. This gave rise to the concept of the '[[ceremonial county]]'. From a geographical and ceremonial point of view, England continues to be made up of the counties established in 1974, with one or two exceptions (see below). These counties still have a lord lieutenant and sheriff, and are therefore usually referred to as ceremonial counties.\n\n===Local Government Act (1992)===\n{{Further|Local Government Commission for England (1992)}}\n{{Further|Ceremonial Counties of England}}\n\nBy the 1990s, it was apparent that the 'one-size fits all' approach of the 1974 reforms did not work equally well in all cases. The consequent loss of education, social services and libraries to county control, was strongly regretted by the larger towns outside the new [[metropolitan county|metropolitan counties]], such as Bristol, Plymouth, Stoke, Leicester and Nottingham.<ref name=reformed>{{cite book|last=Redcliffe-Maud|first=Lord|others=Wood, Bruce|title=English Local Government Reformed|url=https://archive.org/details/englishlocalgove0000redc|url-access=registration|year=1974|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=0-19-888091-X}}</ref><ref name=process>{{cite book|last=Wood|first=Bruce|title=The Process of Local Government Reform: 1966-1974|year=1976|publisher=George Allen & Unwin|isbn=0-04-350052-8}}</ref>  The abolition of metropolitan county councils in 1986 had left the metropolitan boroughs operating as 'unitary' (i.e., only one tier) authorities, and other large cities (and former county boroughs) wished for a return to unitary governance.\n\n[[Image:EnglandSubdivisions1998 rainbow.png|thumb|200px|Map showing counties and unitary authorities from 1998. Pink (non-metropolitan) and green (metropolitan and London) areas were left unchanged. Yellow areas are unitary authorities created as a result of the review, whilst blue areas are remaining two-tier counties reduced by the creation of unitary authorities.]]\n\nThe Local Government Act (1992) established a commission ([[Local Government Commission for England (1992)|Local Government Commission for England]]) to examine the issues, and make recommendations on where unitary authorities should be established. It was considered too expensive to make the system entirely unitary, and also there would doubtlessly be cases where the two-tier system functioned well. The commission recommended that many counties be moved to completely unitary systems; that some cities become unitary authorities, but that the remainder of their parent counties remain two-tier; and that in some counties the ''status quo'' should remain.\n\nThe first major changes to be recommended were for unpopular new counties created in 1974. Three of these had artificially united the areas around rivers/estuaries ([[Cleveland, England|Cleveland]], [[Humberside]] and [[Avon (county)|Avon]]), and the commission recommended that they be split into four new unitary authorities. This effectively gave a 'metropolitan borough-like' status to the cities of [[Kingston upon Hull|Hull]], [[Bristol]] and [[Middlesbrough]]. It also restored the [[East Riding of Yorkshire]] as a ''de facto'' county. [[Rutland]] was reestablished as a unitary authority, thus regaining its cherished 'independence' from Leicestershire. The merged county of [[Hereford & Worcester]] was restored to [[Herefordshire]] (as a unitary authority) and [[Worcestershire]] (as a two-tier authority).\n\nThe only other county to be moved to a wholly unitary system was [[Berkshire]]; the county council was abolished and 6 unitary authorities established in its place. In [[County Durham]], [[North Yorkshire]], [[Lancashire]], [[Cheshire]], [[Staffordshire]], [[Nottinghamshire]], [[Derbyshire]], [[Leicestershire]], [[Cambridgeshire]], [[Wiltshire]], [[Hampshire]], [[Devon]], [[Dorset]], [[East Sussex]], [[Shropshire]], [[Kent]], [[Essex]], [[Bedfordshire]] and [[Buckinghamshire]], one or two major towns/cities were established as unitary authorities, with the rest of the county remaining two tier. All other counties were unaffected.\n\nWhilst these reforms had removed unpopular new counties, they created a rather haphazard situation, which was for the most part like the old counties & county borough system; but in which areas taken to make the abolished new counties was not returned to the historic county. Thus, for instance, the non-urban unitary authority of, e.g., [[Cleveland]] & [[Redcar]] was not, administratively, in any county. In recognition of these problems, the [[Lieutenancies Act 1997]] was passed. This firmly separated all local authority areas (whether unitary or two-tier), from the geographical concept of a county as  high level spatial unit. The lieutenancies it established became known as [[ceremonial counties]], since they were no longer administrative divisions. The counties represent a compromise between the [[historic counties of England|historic counties]] and the counties established in 1974. They are as 1974 except that; north Lincolnshire returned to [[Lincolnshire]] and the remainder of Humberside became East Riding of Yorkshire; Bristol is established as a county; the remainder of Avon returned to [[Somerset]] and [[Gloucestershire]]; Cleveland was split between County Durham and North Yorkshire; Herefordshire and Worcestershire were separated; and Rutland was re-established as a county.\n\n===Creation of additional unitary authorities after 2000===\nThe years after 2000 saw further substantial changes, leading to a still more varied (some might say haphazard) system. Various Counties were made into unitary authorities: some by abolition of Districts (e.g. Cornwall, Northumberland), others by geographical division into two or more unitaries (e.g. Bedfordshire).\n \nThe Labour government (1997\u20132010) of the United Kingdom had planned to introduce eight regional assemblies around England, to devolve power to the regions. This would have sat alongside the devolved [[Welsh Assembly|Welsh]], [[Scottish Assembly|Scottish]] and [[Northern Ireland Assembly|Northern Irish]] Assemblies. In the event, only a [[London Assembly]] (and directly elected [[Mayor]]) was established. Rejection in a referendum of a proposed North-East Assembly in 2004 effectively scrapped those plans.\n\n===Local enterprise partnerships and local authority leaders' boards===\nThe abolition of [[regional development agency|regional development agencies]] and the creation of [[local enterprise partnership]]s were announced as part of the [[June 2010 United Kingdom budget]].<ref name=\"Budget June 2010\">{{cite book | url=http://www.direct.gov.uk/prod_consum_dg/groups/dg_digitalassets/@dg/@en/documents/digitalasset/dg_188581.pdf | date=22 June 2010 | accessdate=7 October 2010 | publisher=HM Treasury | author=Mark Hoban | title=Budget 2010 | archive-url=http://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/20121015000000/http://www.direct.gov.uk/prod_consum_dg/groups/dg_digitalassets/%40dg/%40en/documents/digitalasset/dg_188581.pdf | archive-date=15 October 2012 | url-status=dead }}</ref> On 29 June 2010 a letter was sent from the [[Department of Communities and Local Government]] and the [[Department for Business, Innovation and Skills]] to local authority and business leaders, inviting proposals to replace regional development agencies in their areas by 6 September 2010.<ref name=\"DCLG 1626854\">{{ cite web | url= http://www.communities.gov.uk/localgovernment/local/localenterprisepartnerships/ | title= Local enterprise partnerships | author= | publisher=Department of Communities and Local Government | date=29 June 2010 | accessdate=7 October 2010 }}</ref>\n\nMany of the [[regional development agency|regional development agencies]] were transferred to the unelected [[Local authority leaders' board]]s following abolition in March 2010, but funding was also cut for them by the Government in July 2010.

In 2010 the Government accepted a proposal from the [[Association of Greater Manchester Authorities]] to establish a Greater Manchester Combined Authority as an indirectly elected, top tier, strategic authority for [[Greater Manchester]]. Following the unsuccessful [[2012 English mayoral referendums|English mayoral referendums]] in 2012 combined authorities have been used as an alternative means to receive additional powers and funding as part of 'city deals' to metropolitan areas. In 2014 indirectly elected combined authorities were established for the metropolitan counties of [[South Yorkshire]] and [[West Yorkshire]], and two combined authorities were established which each covered a metropolitan county and adjacent non-metropolitan districts:  the [[Liverpool City Region Combined Authority]] for [[Merseyside]] and the [[Borough of Halton]] unitary authority, and the [[North East Combined Authority]] for [[Tyne and Wear]] and the unitary authorities of [[County Durham]] and [[Northumberland]].  Further combined authorities are proposed for a number of areas.\n\n==The City of London==\n{{Further|City of London}}\n\nThe one exception to the general trends in the development of local government in England has been (and remains) the City of London. This refers only to the actual City of London (as distinct from the Greater London area, and the nearby [[City of Westminster]]). In the UK, [[City status in the United Kingdom|city status]] is granted by royal charter; whilst in common parlance 'city' (lower case) is used to mean a large urban area, 'City' refers specifically to a specific legal entity. Thus, what might be considered the 'city of London' contains both the 'City of London' and 'City of Westminster'. The City of London, covering a relatively small area, (often called 'The Square Mile' or just 'The City') is the main financial district of London, and only houses c.7,200 permanent residents.\n\nFor a variety of reasons, including a singular relationship with the Crown, the City of London has remained an archaic oddity within the English system of local government. As discussed above, the City of London was administered separately from the reign of [[Alfred the Great]] onwards, and was very quickly granted self-governance after the Norman conquest. Until 1835, the City of London was a fairly normal (municipal) [[borough]], run by the [[Lord Mayor of London|Lord Mayor]] and [[Corporation of London]], which had also received [[county corporate]] status (and thus was technically 'The County and City of London'). However, unlike most other cities and boroughs of the time, London was not reformed by the [[Municipal Corporations Act 1835]]; and unlike the other unreformed cities and boroughs of the time, never has been.\n\nIn the major local government reforms of 1888 the City of London, unlike other municipal boroughs and counties corporate, was not made into either a [[county borough]] or a district within an [[administrative county]]. Nor indeed was it placed within a statutory county at that time, remaining administratively separate from the [[County of London]] (though within it geographically). Nor was the status of the City of London as a county corporate abolished in 1974, unlike the (by then ceremonial) status of the other counties corporate, nor was the City of London included in any of the London boroughs created in 1965; although at that time it did become included within the [[Greater London]] county, as a ''de facto'' 33rd borough in the second tier of local government. The City of London has continued in name and administration to be a municipal borough and county corporate since 1888, whilst acting as a ''de facto'' county borough until 1965, and since 1965 as a ''de facto'' London borough.\n\nWhen Greater London Council was abolished in 1986, the City of London reverted to being a unitary authority (like the London boroughs). Under the terms of the [[Lieutenancies Act 1997]], it is now classed as a ceremonial county by itself, separate from the Greater London ceremonial county (in to which the 32 London Boroughs are grouped). However, the City of London does now form part of the new Greater London [[Regions of England|region]] (which is the modern Greater London ceremonial county, plus the City of London; i.e., the post-1965 Greater London administrative area), and as such falls under the strategic management of the [[Greater London Authority]].\n\nThe current system retains non-democratic elements to the election of the local government. The primary justification for this is that the services provided by the City of London are used by approximately 450,000 workers who dwell outside the City, and only by 7200 residents (a ratio not found elsewhere in the UK). In reflection of this, businesses based in the City can vote in the local elections, a practice abolished elsewhere in England in 1969.<ref>{{cite hansard|house=House of Lords|url=https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/vo060525/wmstext/60525m0001.htm|title=Elections: City of London|date=25 May 2006|column_start=91WS|column_end=92WS}}</ref>\n\n[[File:City of London Ward Map, 1870.svg|thumb|A map of the wards of the City as they were in the late 19th century.]]\nThe City of London has a [[Wards of the City of London|different type of ward]] than used presently elsewhere in the country, another remnant of ancient local government found in the \"square mile\" of the City.

Bonfigli's method is also similar to his teacher, [[Benozzo Gozzoli]], who had been Fra Angelico's assistant and had worked in Umbria from 1450 to 1456, in that he uses softer colors on the garments of his figures that brings additional depth to his paintings.<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite book|title=The Earlier Italian Schools|last=Davies|first=Martin|publisher=National Gallery Catalogues|year=1951|isbn=|location=London|pages=72}}</ref>\n\n== Early life and first works ==\nBonfigli trained in Perugia from 1430 to 1440, while the late-Gothic style was still dominant.

A close interpretation of Bonfigli's style is evident in a fresco dated 1446 of ''SS Catherine and Clement I'' in S. Cristoforo, Passigano; this piece, likely not the work of Bonfigli, demonstrates the influence the painter had on the region.{{Citation needed|date=May 2017}}<!-- link to subscriber page, no date <ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.oxfordartonline.com/subscriber/|title=Bonfigli, Benedetto|last=|first=|date=March 6, 2017|website=Oxford Art Online|archiveurl=|archivedate=|accessdate=}}</ref>-->\n[[File:Madonna_and_Child_with_Angels_(ca._1450).jpg|left|thumb|''Madonna and Child with Angels (ca. 1450),'' Altarpiece, Benedetto Bonfigli, [[Galleria Nazionale dell'Umbria]]]]\n\n== Maturity ==\nBonfigli reached maturity as an artist after returning to Perugia from the Rome between 1453 and 1470.<ref name=\":3\" /> During this period, he painted the&nbsp;''Annunciation'', a smaller piece but among his most well known and preserved, held in the [[Thyssen-Bornemisza Museum]] in Madrid. Bonfigli was influenced by the style of&nbsp;[[Benozzo Gozzoli|Gozzoli]], a Florentine Renaissance painter; his stylistic method is evident in Bonfigli's&nbsp;''Annunciation with St. Luke''&nbsp;and&nbsp;''Vigin and the Four Saints'', both held in the&nbsp;[[Galleria Nazionale dell'Umbria]]&nbsp;in Perugia, Italy. According to&nbsp;[[Giorgio Vasari]], the Perugian artist painted the&nbsp;''Adoration of the Magi''&nbsp;coupled with a predella of&nbsp;''Episodes from the Life of Christ and a Miracle of St Nicholas''&nbsp;in 1466 for&nbsp;the chapel of San Vincenzo in [[Basilica di San Domenico di Perugia|San Domenico]], collaborating with&nbsp;[[Bartolomeo Caporali]].<ref name=\":3\" /><ref name=\":1\" /> One of his masterpieces is a series of frescoes in the chapel of the [[Palazzo dei Priori]] in [[Perugia]], which represent the&nbsp;''Lives of St. Louis of Toulouse and St. Herculanus''; the frescoes were commenced in 1454 and not finished in 1496, in which year Bonfigli's will is dated. One&nbsp;''gonfalone,''&nbsp;or banner, was painted in 1465 for the brotherhood of San Bernardino, and representing the deeds of their patron saint. Another&nbsp;''gonfalone''&nbsp;was painted for the brotherhood of San Fiorenzo in 1476. He painted the&nbsp;''Virgin of Mercy''&nbsp;(1478) for the church of the Commenda di Santa Croce. All of these works comprised a collection of&nbsp;''gonfaloni''&nbsp;across Perugia.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n===The Palazzo dei Priori===\nChaplain Bartolomeo da Siena commissioned Bonfigli in 1454 to decorate half of the Priori Chapel. The chaplain intended to have the chapel painted with the Crucifixion with the Virgin and SS [[John the Evangelist]], Laurence and [[Herculanus of Perugia|Herculanus]] on the altar wall; and four scenes from the life of [[Louis of Toulouse|St Louis of Toulouse]]. The commission was altered later, and the fresco of the Crucifixion on the altar wall was not painted. The other four scenes of St Louis of Toulouse were arranged counter-clockwise from the right of the altar wall. One scene shows St Louis professing the Franciscan Rule before Pope Boniface VIII; another shows St Louis posthumously reuniting a merchant, with the church of San Domenico in Perugia clearly visible in the background; the third, badly damaged, depicts a miracle performed by St Louis; and the fourth shows St Louis burial in a church resembling the church of St Pietro in Perugia. This half of the Priori chapel was finished in 1461, and the artist [[Filippo Lippi]] adjudicated the work and priced it at 400 Florentine florins. The works are now held in the [[Galleria Nazionale dell'Umbria]].<ref name=\":2\" />[[File:Per-Gal-Bonfigli-Herculanus.jpg|thumb|300x300px|''Totila's Siege of Perugia,'' Benedetto Bonfigli, [[Galleria Nazionale dell'Umbria]]]]\n\n==== ''Totila's siege of Perugia'' ====\nThe second half of the chapel was also commissioned to Bonfigli to decorate. The frescoes on the second half depict the scenes from the life of St Herculanus. The original commission was for four frescoes, but Bonfigli only painted three. The right of the back wall was painted with the fresco ''Totila's siege of Perugia.'' This wildly active fresco is divided into two scenes, with the siege of Totila depicted on the left and the scene after the city has fallen on the right. The left side shows Totila's army camped out around the ruins of the amphitheater outside Porta Marzia that effected the siege when it began in 542. The left scene takes place in 549, where the soldiers gather around an ox. This ox was thrown over the city walls by St. Herculanus to convince the army the city still had provisions, but the trick was ruined by a cleric who revealed the lie. The right side of the fresco shows a few citizens of Perugia laying a beheaded St. Herculanus and a young boy into a grave after the city had fallen. The city in the background provides a depiction of the Colle Landone, a hill in Perugia occupied by the Etruscans in 4th century B.C., before the building of the Roman wall Rocca Paolina in 1540. The fresco shows historical buildings of Perugia, including the Porta Marzia, the church of Sant' Ercolano, and the towers of Baglioni palaces.<ref name=\":2\"/>\n[[File:Per-Bonfigli-S-Pietro.jpg|left|thumb|''Translation to San Pietro,'' Benedetto Bonfigli, [[Galleria Nazionale dell'Umbria]]]]\n\n==== ''Translation to San Pietro'' ====\nLeft of the altar wall in the Priori Chapel is the fresco ''Translation to San Pietro.'' The scene takes place after the fall of Perugia to Totila and the martyrdom of St. Herculanus. A procession carries the uncorrupt body of St. Herculanus, having passed Sant\u2019 Ercolano&nbsp;and&nbsp;San Domenico and about to enter San Pietro. Herculanus is carried on a [[bier]], and a small boy behind him to the left represents the boy whom had been buried with him and brought back to life.<ref name=\":2\"/>\n\n==== ''Translation to the Duomo'' ====\nThe whole of the left wall of the Chapel was covered with a scene that has been badly damaged. The frescos depict the translation of the relics of St. Herculanus in 936 from San Pietro to the Duomo. The surviving fragments show three different scenes; a group of Dominicans entering the Duomo, the Palazzo dei Priori with city magistrates passing along the side; and a group of women passing alongside the San Domenico Vecchio.

The work is believed to have been executed between 1440 and 1445. The Virgin Mary appears to pray on the right next to the Archangel Gabriel with gold wings on the left. Gabriel is kneeling with a lily in his left hand, and his right hand raised in blessing while he pronounces the phrase on the marbel-panelled parapet, \"AVE MARIA GRATIA PLENA,\" or \"Hail Mary full of grace.\"<ref name=\":3\" /> Within the open terrace enclosed by the decorated parapet is Mary's lectern and wooden chair in the middle distance. An open prayer book rests on the lectern, which has an open cupboard containing various books. The background depicts a walled city on the shores of a lake, active with merchant vessels.\n\nBonfigli demonstrates his style combining gold elements with gothic features, contrasting the divine halos and wings with the Gothic windows of the double loggia, presumed to be the Virgin's house, on the right.<ref name=\":3\" /> Bonfigli uses gold not only to accentuate the divine elements in the piece, but also in the greater, more earthly areas of the sky and textiles worn by Mary and the angel. This use of gold is often attributed with an earlier Gothic style, but does not detract from the sense of depth or reality in the scene. Bonfigli contrasts the Gothic details of the piece with classical ones, including the low wall separating the foreground and background that appears to be more modern in material and design. The landscape in the ''Annunciation'' is also attributed to the influence of [[Domenico Veneziano]], another Renaissance painter who worked in Perugia from 1438 to 1454. This piece is often compared with Veneziano's earliest dated work, ''Adoration of the Magi'', held in the Gem\u00e4ldegalerie in Berlin, where Bonfigli derived the sense of depth created by the pine trees in the middle of the painting.  [[Fra Angelico]]'s influence can also be noticed in the fine details of the work in the immediate foreground, such as the glass vase filled with roses.\n\nThe ''Annunciation'' belonged to the collection of Thomas Pelham Hood in Ulster during the 19th century, and was passed to another private collection in Rome before being sold on the Italian art market. In 1977, the first year the piece was on the market, it was purchased by [[Hans Heinrich Thyssen-Bornemisza|Baron Hans Heinrich Thyssen-Bornemisza]].<ref name=\"The Annunciation\"/> The painting has suffered wear; the colors are rubbed and the modeling in the faces has suffered damage, and vertical cracks exist in the painted surface.

Bonfigli was influenced by the style of&nbsp;[[Benozzo Gozzoli|Gozzoli]], a Florentine Renaissance painter; his stylistic method is evident in Bonfigli's&nbsp;''Annunciation with St. Luke''&nbsp;and&nbsp;''Vigin and the Four Saints'', both held in the&nbsp;[[Galleria Nazionale dell'Umbria]]&nbsp;in Perugia, Italy. According to&nbsp;[[Giorgio Vasari]], the Perugian artist painted the&nbsp;''Adoration of the Magi''&nbsp;coupled with a predella of&nbsp;''Episodes from the Life of Christ and a Miracle of St Nicholas''&nbsp;in 1466 for&nbsp;the chapel of San Vincenzo in [[Basilica di San Domenico di Perugia|San Domenico]], collaborating with&nbsp;[[Bartolomeo Caporali]].<ref name=\":3\" /><ref name=\":1\" /> One of his masterpieces is a series of frescoes in the chapel of the [[Palazzo dei Priori]] in [[Perugia]], which represent the&nbsp;''Lives of St. Louis of Toulouse and St. Herculanus''; the frescoes were commenced in 1454 and not finished in 1496, in which year Bonfigli's will is dated. One&nbsp;''gonfalone,''&nbsp;or banner, was painted in 1465 for the brotherhood of San Bernardino, and representing the deeds of their patron saint. Another&nbsp;''gonfalone''&nbsp;was painted for the brotherhood of San Fiorenzo in 1476. He painted the&nbsp;''Virgin of Mercy''&nbsp;(1478) for the church of the Commenda di Santa Croce. All of these works comprised a collection of&nbsp;''gonfaloni''&nbsp;across Perugia.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n===The Palazzo dei Priori===\nChaplain Bartolomeo da Siena commissioned Bonfigli in 1454 to decorate half of the Priori Chapel. The chaplain intended to have the chapel painted with the Crucifixion with the Virgin and SS [[John the Evangelist]], Laurence and [[Herculanus of Perugia|Herculanus]] on the altar wall; and four scenes from the life of [[Louis of Toulouse|St Louis of Toulouse]]. The commission was altered later, and the fresco of the Crucifixion on the altar wall was not painted. The other four scenes of St Louis of Toulouse were arranged counter-clockwise from the right of the altar wall. One scene shows St Louis professing the Franciscan Rule before Pope Boniface VIII; another shows St Louis posthumously reuniting a merchant, with the church of San Domenico in Perugia clearly visible in the background; the third, badly damaged, depicts a miracle performed by St Louis; and the fourth shows St Louis burial in a church resembling the church of St Pietro in Perugia. This half of the Priori chapel was finished in 1461, and the artist [[Filippo Lippi]] adjudicated the work and priced it at 400 Florentine florins. The works are now held in the [[Galleria Nazionale dell'Umbria]].<ref name=\":2\" />[[File:Per-Gal-Bonfigli-Herculanus.jpg|thumb|300x300px|''Totila's Siege of Perugia,'' Benedetto Bonfigli, [[Galleria Nazionale dell'Umbria]]]]\n\n==== ''Totila's siege of Perugia'' ====\nThe second half of the chapel was also commissioned to Bonfigli to decorate. The frescoes on the second half depict the scenes from the life of St Herculanus. The original commission was for four frescoes, but Bonfigli only painted three. The right of the back wall was painted with the fresco ''Totila's siege of Perugia.'' This wildly active fresco is divided into two scenes, with the siege of Totila depicted on the left and the scene after the city has fallen on the right. The left side shows Totila's army camped out around the ruins of the amphitheater outside Porta Marzia that effected the siege when it began in 542. The left scene takes place in 549, where the soldiers gather around an ox. This ox was thrown over the city walls by St. Herculanus to convince the army the city still had provisions, but the trick was ruined by a cleric who revealed the lie. The right side of the fresco shows a few citizens of Perugia laying a beheaded St. Herculanus and a young boy into a grave after the city had fallen. The city in the background provides a depiction of the Colle Landone, a hill in Perugia occupied by the Etruscans in 4th century B.C., before the building of the Roman wall Rocca Paolina in 1540. The fresco shows historical buildings of Perugia, including the Porta Marzia, the church of Sant' Ercolano, and the towers of Baglioni palaces.<ref name=\":2\"/>\n[[File:Per-Bonfigli-S-Pietro.jpg|left|thumb|''Translation to San Pietro,'' Benedetto Bonfigli, [[Galleria Nazionale dell'Umbria]]]]\n\n==== ''Translation to San Pietro'' ====\nLeft of the altar wall in the Priori Chapel is the fresco ''Translation to San Pietro.'' The scene takes place after the fall of Perugia to Totila and the martyrdom of St. Herculanus. A procession carries the uncorrupt body of St. Herculanus, having passed Sant\u2019 Ercolano&nbsp;and&nbsp;San Domenico and about to enter San Pietro.
