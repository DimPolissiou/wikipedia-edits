Prior to statehood, the [[Northwest Ordinance]] of 1787 included a provision to establish an institution of higher education in what became Ohio. American Western University was chartered in 1802 as a result, but never opened. Two years later, the new [[Ohio General Assembly]] chartered [[Ohio University]], which opened for classes in 1809, followed by [[Miami University]], which was chartered in 1809 and opened in 1824.  In northern Ohio, Western Reserve College (now [[Case Western Reserve University]]) was established in 1826.<ref>See [[College Lands]]: Ohio University Chartered, and [[Land Ordinance of 1785]], and {{cite book|title = A compilation of laws, treaties, resolutions, and ordinances: of the general and state governments, which relate to lands in the state of Ohio; including the laws adopted by the governor and judges; the laws of the territorial legislature; and the laws of this state, to the years 1815\u201316 | publisher = G.

Lewis]] Building at [[Case Western Reserve University]].]]\n\nThe [[Ohio Board of Regents]] oversees the public institutions of higher education in Ohio. This system has come under some criticism in recent years as contributing greatly to overlap and redundancies in the higher education system. For example, Ohio's public university system supports nine doctoral programs in history and five law schools while four different public universities in Ohio operate airports and offer aviation programs. At the same time, the system has been lauded for creating powerful \"utility\" organizations, such as [[OhioLINK]] and the [[Ohio Supercomputer Center]], which allow campuses to collaborate and achieve significant efficiencies. A new credit transfer program makes transferring among Ohio's public campuses much easier, and allows students to preview academic programs.\n\n11 of the 14 public universities top the state's enrollment statistics. The remaining three public institutions\u2014[[Shawnee State University]], [[Central State University]] and [[Northeast Ohio Medical University]]\u2014are relatively small.  [[Case Western Reserve University]] is the state's largest private university by enrollment, followed by the [[University of Dayton]], [[Xavier University]], [[Franklin University]], [[Ashland University]], and [[University of Findlay]].\n\n== Institutions ==\n\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:left;\"\n|+\nActive institutions\n!School\n!Location(s)\n!Control\n!Type<ref>As noted by [[Carnegie Classification of Institutions of Higher Education]].</ref>\n!Enrollment<ref>As noted by [[Carnegie Classification of Institutions of Higher Education]].

higher learning. Prior to statehood, the [[Northwest Ordinance]] of 1787 included a provision to establish an institution of higher education in what became Ohio. American Western University was chartered in 1802 as a result, but never opened. Two years later, the new [[Ohio General Assembly]] chartered [[Ohio University]], which opened for classes in 1809, followed by [[Miami University]], which was chartered in 1809 and opened in 1824.  In northern Ohio, Western Reserve College (now [[Case Western Reserve University]]) was established in 1826.<ref>See [[College Lands]]: Ohio University Chartered, and [[Land Ordinance of 1785]], and {{cite book|title = A compilation of laws, treaties, resolutions, and ordinances: of the general and state governments, which relate to lands in the state of Ohio; including the laws adopted by the governor and judges; the laws of the territorial legislature; and the laws of this state, to the years 1815\u201316 | publisher = G.

Lewis]] Building at [[Case Western Reserve University]].]]\n\nThe [[Ohio Board of Regents]] oversees the public institutions of higher education in Ohio. This system has come under some criticism in recent years as contributing greatly to overlap and redundancies in the higher education system. For example, Ohio's public university system supports nine doctoral programs in history and five law schools while four different public universities in Ohio operate airports and offer aviation programs. At the same time, the system has been lauded for creating powerful \"utility\" organizations, such as [[OhioLINK]] and the [[Ohio Supercomputer Center]], which allow campuses to collaborate and achieve significant efficiencies. A new credit transfer program makes transferring among Ohio's public campuses much easier, and allows students to preview academic programs.\n\n11 of the 14 public universities top the state's enrollment statistics. The remaining three public institutions\u2014[[Shawnee State University]], [[Central State University]] and [[Northeast Ohio Medical University]]\u2014are relatively small.  [[Case Western Reserve University]] is the state's largest private university by enrollment, followed by the [[University of Dayton]], [[Xavier University]], [[Franklin University]], [[Ashland University]], and [[University of Findlay]].\n\n== Institutions ==\n\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:left;\"\n|+\nActive institutions\n!School\n!Location(s)\n!Control\n!Type<ref>As noted by [[Carnegie Classification of Institutions of Higher Education]].</ref>\n!Enrollment<ref>As noted by [[Carnegie Classification of Institutions of Higher Education]].

He campaigned for [[Catholic emancipation]]\u2014including the right for Catholics to sit in the [[Westminster Parliament]], denied for over 100 years\u2014and repeal of the [[Acts of Union 1800|Acts of Union]] which combined [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland|Great Britain and Ireland]].\n\nThroughout his career in Irish politics, O'Connell was able to gain a large following among the Irish masses in support of him and his [[Catholic Association]]. O'Connell's main strategy was one of political [[reformism]], working within the parliamentary structures of the British state in Ireland and forming an alliance of convenience with the [[Whigs (British political party)|Whigs]]. More radical elements broke with O'Connell to found the [[Young Ireland]] movement.\n\n==Early life==\nO'Connell was born at Carhan near [[Cahersiveen]], [[County Kerry]], to the [[O'Connells of Derrynane]], a wealthy Roman Catholic family  that had been dispossessed of its lands. His parents were Morgan O'Connell  and Catherine O'Mullane. Among his uncles was [[Daniel Charles, Count O'Connell]], an officer in the Irish Brigades of the [[French Army]].  A famous aunt was [[Eibhl\u00edn Dubh N\u00ed Chonaill]], while [[Sir James O'Connell, 1st Baronet]], was his younger brother.  Under the patronage of his wealthy bachelor uncle [[Maurice O'Connell (Hunting Cap)|Maurice \"Hunting Cap\" O'Connell]]. O'Connell was first sent with his brother Maurice to Reddington Academy at Long Island, near Queenstown (Cobh)<ref>J. J. Fr. Harrington's Reddington Academy Walterstown (Baile Ualtair) is a townland in Cobh Rural ED, in Templerobin Civil Parish, in Barony, in Co. Cork, Ireland. O'Kelly \"O'Connell Calling: the Liberator\u2019s place in the world\" (Kerryman, 1949)</ref> They both studied at [[Douai]] in France from 1790 and O'Connell was admitted as a [[barrister]] to [[Lincoln's Inn]] in 1794, transferring to [[Dublin]]'s [[King's Inns]] two years later. In his early years, he became acquainted with the pro-democracy radicals of the time and committed himself to bringing equal rights and religious tolerance to his own country.<ref name=\"Boylan1998\">{{cite book | last = Boylan | first = Henry | year = 1998 | title = A Dictionary of Irish Biography | edition = 3rd | page = 306 | location = Dublin | publisher = Gill and MacMillan | isbn = 0-7171-2945-4 }}</ref>\n\n[[File:O'Connells Home At Derrynane Abby.JPG|thumb|left|O'Connell's home at [[Derrynane House|Derrynane]]]]\nWhile in Dublin studying for the law, O'Connell was under his Uncle Maurice's instructions not to become involved in any militia activity. When [[Theobald Wolfe Tone|Wolfe Tone]]'s [[Wolfe Tone#Hoche's expedition and the 1798 rebellion|French invasion fleet]] entered [[Bantry Bay]] in December 1796, O'Connell found himself in a quandary. Politics was the cause of his unsettlement.<ref name=\"Gywnn\">\nDennis Gywnn, ''Daniel O'Connell The Irish Liberator'', Hutchinson & Co. Ltd pg 71</ref> Dennis Gwynn in his ''Daniel O'Connell: The Irish Liberator'' suggests that the unsettlement was because he was enrolled as a volunteer in defence of Government, yet the Government was intensifying its persecution of the Catholic people\u2014of which he was one.<ref name=\"Gywnn\" /> He desired to enter Parliament, yet every allowance that the Catholics had been led to anticipate, two years previously, was now flatly vetoed.<ref name=\"Gywnn\" />\n\nAs a law student, O'Connell was aware of his own talents, but the higher ranks of the Bar were closed to him. He read the ''[[Jockey Club]]'' as a picture of the governing class in England and was persuaded by it that, \"vice reigns triumphant in the English court at this day. The spirit of [[liberty]] shrinks to protect property from the attacks of French innovators. The corrupt higher orders tremble for their vicious enjoyments.\"<ref name=\"Gywnn\" />\n\nO'Connell's studies at the time had concentrated upon the legal and political history of Ireland, and the debates of the Historical Society concerned the records of governments, and from this he was to conclude, according to one of his biographers, \"in Ireland the whole policy of the Government was to repress the people and to maintain the ascendancy of a privileged and corrupt minority\".<ref name=\"Gywnn\" />\n\nOn 3 January 1797, in an atmosphere of alarm over the French invasion fleet in Bantry Bay, he wrote to his uncle saying that he was the last of his colleagues to join a volunteer corps and \"being young, active, healthy and single\" he could offer no plausible excuse.<ref>O'Connell Correspondence, Vol I, Letter No. 24a</ref> Later that month, for the sake of expediency, he joined the Lawyers' Artillery Corps.<ref>O'Ferrall, F., ''Daniel O'Connell, Dublin'', 1981, p. 12</ref>\n\nOn 19 May 1798, O'Connell was called to the [[Irish Bar]] and became a [[barrister]]. Four days later, the [[Society of the United Irishmen|United Irishmen]] staged their [[Irish Rebellion of 1798|rebellion]] which was put down by the British with great bloodshed. O'Connell did not support the rebellion; he believed that the Irish would have to assert themselves politically rather than by force.\n\nHe went on the [[Munster]] circuit, and for over a decade, he went into a fairly quiet period of private law practice in the south of Ireland.<ref name=\"Boylan1998\" /> He was reputed to have the largest income of any Irish barrister but, due to natural extravagance and a growing family, was usually in debt; his brother remarked caustically that Daniel was in debt all his life from the age of seventeen. Although he was ultimately to inherit Derrynane from his uncle Maurice, the old man lived to be almost 100 and in the event Daniel's inheritance did not cover his debts.\n\nHe also condemned [[Robert Emmet]]'s [[Irish Rebellion of 1803|Rebellion of 1803]]. Of Emmet, a Protestant, he wrote: \"A man who could coolly prepare so much bloodshed, so many murders\u2014and such horrors of every kind has ceased to be an object of compassion.\"<ref>O'Connell Correspondence, Vol I, Letter No. 97</ref>\n\nDespite his opposition to the use of violence, he was willing to defend those accused of political crimes, particularly if he suspected that they had been falsely accused, as in the [[Doneraile]] conspiracy trials of 1829, his last notable court appearance. He was noted for his fearlessness in court: if he thought poorly of a judge (as was very often the case) he had no hesitation in making this clear. Most famous perhaps was his retort to [[James McClelland (Solicitor-General)|Baron McClelland]], who had said that as a barrister he would never have taken the course O'Connell had adopted: O'Connell said that McClelland had never been his model as a barrister, neither would he take directions from him as a judge.<ref>O'Faol\u00e1in, Sean (1936). ''King of the Beggars: a life of Daniel O'Connell''. Alan Figgis reissue, p. 97</ref> He did not lack the ambition to become a judge himself: in particular he was attracted by the position of [[Master of the Rolls in Ireland]], yet although he was offered it more than once, finally refused.\n\n==Family==\n[[File:Mary O'Connell.tif|thumb| 1836 Portrait of Mary O'Connell by John Gubbins]]\n[[File:Daniel O'Connell.png|thumb|left|Daniel O'Connell, in an 1836 watercolour by Bernard Mulrenin. <!--''Daniel O'Connell'', 1836, by [[Bernard Mulrenin]]-->]]\n[[File:St Patricks Cathedral (Daniel O'Connell Statue).jpg|thumb|Statue of Daniel O'Connell outside [[St Patrick's Cathedral, Melbourne]]|alt=]]In 1802 O'Connell married his third cousin, [[Mary O'Connell (1778-1836)|Mary O'Connell]]. It was a love marriage, and to persist in it was an act of considerable courage, since Daniel's uncle Maurice was outraged (as Mary had no fortune) and for a time threatened to disinherit them.<ref>Geoghegan  ''King Dan''  pp.94\u20137</ref> They had four daughters (three surviving), [[Ellen Bridget O'Connell|Ellen]] (1805\u20131883), Catherine (1808), Elizabeth (1810), and Rickarda (1815) and four sons. The sons\u2014[[Maurice O'Connell (MP)|Maurice]] (1803), [[Morgan O'Connell|Morgan]]  (1804), [[John O'Connell (MP)|John]] (1810), and [[Daniel O'Connell Jnr|Daniel]] (1816)\u2014all sat in [[Parliament of the United Kingdom|Parliament]]. The marriage was happy and Mary's death in 1837 was a blow from which her husband never fully recovered. He was a devoted father; O'Faol\u00e1in suggests that despite his wide acquaintance he had few close friends and therefore the family circle meant a great deal to him.<ref>O'Faol\u00e1in p.87</ref>\n\n=== O'Connell's Ale and connection with the 'licensed trade' ===\nO'Connell assisted his younger son, Daniel junior, to acquire the Phoenix Brewery in James's Street, Dublin in 1831.<ref>''Irish Whiskey: A 1000 Year Tradition'', Malachy Magee, O'Brien Press, Dublin, {{ISBN|0-86278-228-7}}. pg 68\u201374.</ref> The brewery produced a brand known as \"O'Connell's Ale\" and enjoyed some popularity. By 1832, O'Connell was forced to state that he would not be a political patron of the brewing trade or his son's company, until he was no longer a member of parliament, particularly because O'Connell and [[Arthur Guinness]] were political enemies. Guinness was the \"moderate\" liberal candidate, O'Connell was the \"radical\" liberal candidate. The rivalry caused dozens of Irish firms to boycott Guinness during the 1841 Repeal election. It was at this time that Guinness was accused of supporting the \"Orange system\", and its beer was known as \"Protestant porter\". When the O'Connell family left brewing, the rights to \"O'Connell Dublin Ale\" was sold to John D'Arcy. The brewing business proved to be unsuccessful though, and after a few years was taken over by the manager, John Brennan, while Daniel junior embraced a political career. Brennan changed the name back to the Phoenix Brewery but continued to brew and sell O'Connell's Ale. When the Phoenix Brewery was effectively closed after being absorbed into the Guinness complex in 1909, the brewing of O'Connell's Ale was carried out by John D'Arcy and Son Ltd at the Anchor Brewery in Usher Street. In 1926, D'Arcy's ceased trading and the firm of Watkins, Jameson and Pim carried on the brewing until they too succumbed to the pressures of trying to compete with Guinness.<ref>T. Halpin: History of the Irish Brewing Industry, 1988</ref><ref name=\"sim\">[http://www.simtec.us/dublinbrewing/history.html History of Brewing in Dublin]</ref>\n\nDaniel junior was the committee chairman of the licensed trade association of the period and gave considerable and valuable support to Daniel O'Connell in his public life. Some time later a quarrel arose and O'Connell turned his back on the association and became a strong advocate of [[temperance movement|temperance]]. During the period of [[Theobald Mathew (temperance reformer)|Fr. Mathew]]'s total abstinence crusades many temperance rallies were held, the most notable being a huge rally held on [[St. Patrick's Day]] in 1841. Daniel O'Connell was a guest of honour at another such rally held at the [[Rotunda Hospital]].<ref name=\"sim\" /><ref>St Martin Magazine (ISSN 1393-1008), June 2003 St Martin Apostolate, Dublin</ref>\n\n== Political beliefs and programme ==\n[[File:Daniel O'Connell2.jpg|thumb|\"Daniel O'Connell: The Champion of Liberty\" poster published in [[Pennsylvania]], 1847]]\n\nA critic of violent insurrection ''in Ireland'', O'Connell once said that \"the altar of liberty totters when it is cemented only with blood\", and yet as late as 1841, O'Connell had whipped his MPs into line to keep the [[First Opium War|(First) Opium War]] going in China. The Tories at the time had proposed a motion of censure over the war, and O'Connell had to call upon his MPs to support the Whig Government. As a result of this intervention, the Government was saved.<ref>''[[Charles Gavan Duffy]]: Conversations With Carlyle (1892), with Introduction, Stray Thoughts on Young Ireland'', Brendan Clifford, Athol Books, Belfast, {{ISBN|0-85034-114-0}}.pg 17 &21</ref>\n\nPolitically, he focused on parliamentary and populist methods to force change and made regular declarations of his loyalty to the British Crown. He often warned the British establishment that if they did not reform the governance of Ireland, Irishmen would start to listen to the \"counsels of violent men\". Successive British governments continued to ignore this advice, long after his death, although he succeeded in extracting by the sheer force of will and the power of the Catholic peasants and clergy much of what he wanted, i.e., eliminating disabilities on Roman Catholics; ensuring that lawfully elected Roman Catholics could serve their constituencies in the British Parliament (until the [[Parliament of Ireland|Irish Parliament]] was restored); and amending the Oath of Allegiance so as to remove clauses offensive to Roman Catholics who could then take the Oath in good conscience.<ref name=\"Boylan1998\" />\n\nAlthough a native speaker of the [[Irish language]], O'Connell encouraged Irish people to learn English to better themselves.<ref name=\"Boylan1998\" /> Although he is best known for the campaign for Catholic emancipation; he also supported similar efforts for Irish Jews. At his insistence, in 1846, the British law \"[[History of the Jews in Ireland#18th and 19th century|De Judaismo]]\", which prescribed a special dress for Jews, was repealed. O'Connell said: \"Ireland has claims on your ancient race, it is the only country that I know of unsullied by any one act of persecution of the Jews\".<ref>[http://www.jewishireland.org/history_2.html Jewish Ireland] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100222092245/http://www.jewishireland.org/history_2.html|date=22 February 2010}}</ref>\n\n== Campaigning for Catholic emancipation ==\nO'Connell returned to politics in the 1810s. In 1811, he established the Catholic Board, which campaigned for [[Catholic emancipation]], that is, the opportunity for Irish Catholics to become members of parliament. In 1823, he set up the [[Catholic Association]] which embraced other aims to better Irish Catholics, such as: electoral reform, reform of the [[Church of Ireland]], tenants' rights, and economic development.<ref>Paul Adelmann and Robert Pearce, ''Great Britain and the Irish Question 1798\u20131922'', Hodder Murray, London, {{ISBN|0-340-88901-2}}, p. 33</ref>\n\nThe Association was funded by membership dues of one penny per month, a minimal amount designed to attract Catholic peasants. The subscription was highly successful, and the Association raised a large sum of money in its first year. The money was used to campaign for Catholic emancipation, specifically funding pro-emancipation members of parliament (MPs) standing for the [[British House of Commons]].<ref>Geoghegan, Patrick M.

O'Connell was often briefed for the defence, and showed extraordinary vigour in pleading the rights of Catholics to argue for emancipation. He clashed repeatedly with [[William Saurin]], the [[Attorney General for Ireland]] and most influential figure in the Dublin administration, and political differences between the two men were fuelled by a bitter personal antipathy.<ref>O'Faol\u00e1in pp. 151\u2013179</ref>\n\nIn 1815 a serious event in his life occurred. [[Dublin Corporation]] was considered a stronghold of the [[Protestant Ascendancy]] and O'Connell, in an 1815 speech, referred to it as a \"beggarly corporation\".<ref>{{cite book|last=Millingen|first=John Gideon|title=The history of duelling: including, narratives of the most remarkable personal encounters that have taken place from the earliest period to the present time, Volume 2|year=1841|publisher=R.

The duel had filled [[Dublin Castle]] (from where the [[Dublin Castle administration|British Government administered Ireland]]) with tense excitement at the prospect that O'Connell would be killed. They regarded O'Connell as \"worse than a public nuisance\", and would have welcomed any prospect of seeing him removed at this time.<ref name=\"Dennis Gywnn Pg 138-145\">Dennis Gywnn, ''Daniel O'Connell The Irish Liberator'', Hutchinson & Co.

His conscience was bitterly sore by the fact that, not only had he killed a man, but he had left his family almost destitute.<ref>Geoghegan, ''King Dan''  p. 155</ref>\n\nO'Connell offered to \"share his income\" with D'Esterre's widow, but she declined; however, she consented to accept an allowance for her daughter, which O'Connell regularly paid for more than thirty years until his death. The memory of the duel haunted him for the remainder of his life, and he refused ever to fight another, being prepared to risk accusations of cowardice rather than kill again.<ref name=\"Dennis Gywnn Pg 138-145\" />\n\nAs part of his campaign for Catholic emancipation, O'Connell created the Catholic Association in 1823; this organisation acted as a pressure group against the British government so as to achieve emancipation. The [[Catholic Rent]], which was established in 1824 by O'Connell and the Catholic Church raised funds from which O'Connell was able to help finance the Catholic Association in its push for emancipation. Official opinion was gradually swinging towards emancipation, as shown by the summary dismissal of William Saurin, the Attorney General and a leading opponent of religious toleration, whom O'Connell called \"our mortal foe\".\n\nO'Connell stood in a [[1828 Clare by-election|by-election]] to the British House of Commons in 1828 for [[Clare (UK Parliament constituency)|County Clare]] against [[William Vesey-FitzGerald, 2nd Baron FitzGerald and Vesey|William Vesey Fitzgerald]], who had just joined the British Cabinet as President of the Board of Trade. By law at the time, Cabinet office was deemed to be \"an office of profit\" under the Crown, requiring the promoted man to obtain the endorsement of his constituents by standing for re-election.\n\nAfter O'Connell won election, he was unable to take his seat as members of parliament had to take the [[Oath of Supremacy]], which was incompatible with Catholicism. The Prime Minister, the [[Arthur Wellesley, 1st Duke of Wellington|Duke of Wellington]], and the [[Home Secretary]], Sir [[Robert Peel]], even though they opposed Catholic participation in Parliament, saw that denying O'Connell his seat would cause outrage and could lead to another rebellion or uprising in Ireland, which was about 85% Catholic.<ref>Oliver MacDonagh (1991), ''The Life of Daniel O'Connell''</ref>\n\nPeel and Wellington managed to convince [[George IV of the United Kingdom|King George IV]] that Catholic emancipation and the right of Catholics and [[Presbyterian]]s and members of all Christian faiths other than the established [[Church of Ireland]] to sit in Parliament needed to be established; with the help of the [[Whig (British political party)|Whigs]], the [[Roman Catholic Relief Act 1829|Catholic Relief Act]] became law in 1829.\n\nHowever, the Emancipation Act was not made retroactive, meaning that O'Connell had either to seek re-election or to attempt to take the oath of supremacy. When O'Connell attempted on 15 May to take his seat without taking the oath of supremacy,  Solicitor-General [[Nicholas Conyngham Tindal]] moved that his seat be declared vacant and another election ordered; O'Connell was elected unopposed on 30 July 1829.<ref name=\"Hist Parl\">''[[The History of Parliament]] 1820\u20131832'' vol VI pp. 535\u2013536.</ref>\n\nHe took his seat when Parliament resumed in February 1830, by which time [[Henry Charles Howard, 13th Duke of Norfolk]] and Earl of Surrey, had already become the first Roman Catholic to have taken advantage of the Emancipation Act and sit in Parliament.<ref name=\"Not first\">''[[History of Parliament]] 1820\u20131832'' vol I p. 253.</ref><ref name=\"Not first2\">{{cite web|url=http://www.deskeenan.com/1GrChap8.htm|title=The Grail Chapter Eight|work=deskeenan.com}}</ref>\n\n\"Wellington is the King of England\", King George IV once complained, \"O'Connell is King of Ireland, and I am only the dean of Windsor.\" The regal jest expressed the general admiration for O'Connell at the height of his career.\n\nThe Catholic emancipation campaign led by O'Connell served as the precedent and model for the emancipation of [[British Jews]], the subsequent [[Jews Relief Act 1858]] allowing Jewish MPs to omit the words in the [[Oath of Allegiance]] \"and I make this Declaration upon the true Faith of a Christian\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/Vict/21-22/49/enacted|title=Jews Relief Act 1858|work=legislation.gov.uk}}</ref> O'Connell himself was an opponent of the persecution of Jews praising Ireland as the \"only Christian country that I know of unsullied by any one act of persecution of the Jews.<ref>{{Cite web | url=https://books.google.com/?id=CkULAAAAIAAJ&q=Ireland+has+claims+on+your+ancient+race,+it+is+the+only+country+that+I+know+of+unsullied+by+any+one+act+of+persecution+of+the+Jews%E2%80%9D&dq=Ireland+has+claims+on+your+ancient+race,+it+is+the+only+country+that+I+know+of+unsullied+by+any+one+act+of+persecution+of+the+Jews%E2%80%9D | title=Transactions - the Jewish Historical Society of England| year=1908}}</ref>\n\n===Comments on emancipation===\n[[Michael Doheny]], in his ''The Felon's Track'', says that the very character of emancipation has assumed an \"exaggerated and false guise\" and that it is an error to call it emancipation.

Nonetheless O'Connell rejected [[William Sharman Crawford]]'s call for the complete abolition of tithes in 1838, as he felt he could not embarrass the Whigs (the [[Lichfield House Compact]] secured an alliance between Whigs, radicals and Irish MPs in 1835).<ref name=ste/> In 1838, parliament introduced a {{anchor|Tithe Commutation Act}}Tithe Commutation Act for Ireland.<ref>{{cite book|editor1=Moody, T.

They in turn were to pass payment to the authorities. Tithes were thus effectively added to a tenant's rent payment. This partial relief and elimination of the confrontational collections ended the violent aspect of the Tithe War.\n\nFull relief from the tax was not achieved until the [[Irish Church Act 1869]], which disestablished the Church of Ireland, by the [[William Ewart Gladstone|Gladstone]] government.\n\n\nIn 1841, Daniel O'Connell became the first Roman Catholic [[Lord Mayor of Dublin]] since the reign of [[James II of England|James II]], who had been the last Roman Catholic monarch of England, Ireland and Scotland.<ref name=\"Boylan1998\" />\n\n==Campaign for repeal of the Union==\n[[Image:The Monster Meeting at Clifden in 1843.png|thumb|''The Monster Meeting at [[Clifden]] in 1843'' by [[Joseph Patrick Haverty]].

To campaign for repeal, O'Connell set up the [[Repeal Association]]. He argued for the re-creation of an independent Kingdom of Ireland to govern itself, with [[Victoria of the United Kingdom|Queen Victoria]] as the Queen of Ireland.\n\nTo push for this, he held a series of \"Monster Meetings\" throughout much of Ireland outside the Protestant and Unionist-dominated province of [[Ulster]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.bartleby.com/268/6/17.html|title=In Favor of the Repeal of the Union by Daniel O'Connell.

Clontarf was symbolic because of its association with the [[Battle of Clontarf]] in 1014, when the Irish King [[Brian Boru]] defeated his rival Maelmordha, although Brian himself died during the battle. Despite appeals from his supporters, O'Connell refused to defy the authorities and he called off the meeting, as he was unwilling to risk bloodshed and had no others.<ref name=\"Boylan1998\" /> He was arrested, charged with conspiracy and sentenced to a year's imprisonment and a fine of \u00a32,000, although he was released after three months by the [[House of Lords]], which quashed the conviction and severely criticised the unfairness of the trial.

He campaigned for [[Catholic emancipation]]\u2014including the right for Catholics to sit in the [[Westminster Parliament]], denied for over 100 years\u2014and repeal of the [[Acts of Union 1800|Acts of Union]] which combined [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland|Great Britain and Ireland]].\n\nThroughout his career in Irish politics, O'Connell was able to gain a large following among the Irish masses in support of him and his [[Catholic Association]]. O'Connell's main strategy was one of political [[reformism]], working within the parliamentary structures of the British state in Ireland and forming an alliance of convenience with the [[Whigs (British political party)|Whigs]]. More radical elements broke with O'Connell to found the [[Young Ireland]] movement.\n\n==Early life==\nO'Connell was born at Carhan near [[Cahersiveen]], [[County Kerry]], to the [[O'Connells of Derrynane]], a wealthy Roman Catholic family  that had been dispossessed of its lands. His parents were Morgan O'Connell  and Catherine O'Mullane. Among his uncles was [[Daniel Charles, Count O'Connell]], an officer in the Irish Brigades of the [[French Army]].  A famous aunt was [[Eibhl\u00edn Dubh N\u00ed Chonaill]], while [[Sir James O'Connell, 1st Baronet]], was his younger brother.  Under the patronage of his wealthy bachelor uncle [[Maurice O'Connell (Hunting Cap)|Maurice \"Hunting Cap\" O'Connell]]. O'Connell was first sent with his brother Maurice to Reddington Academy at Long Island, near Queenstown (Cobh)<ref>J. J. Fr.

O'Kelly \"O'Connell Calling: the Liberator\u2019s place in the world\" (Kerryman, 1949)</ref> They both studied at [[Douai]] in France from 1790 and O'Connell was admitted as a [[barrister]] to [[Lincoln's Inn]] in 1794, transferring to [[Dublin]]'s [[King's Inns]] two years later. In his early years, he became acquainted with the pro-democracy radicals of the time and committed himself to bringing equal rights and religious tolerance to his own country.<ref name=\"Boylan1998\">{{cite book | last = Boylan | first = Henry | year = 1998 | title = A Dictionary of Irish Biography | edition = 3rd | page = 306 | location = Dublin | publisher = Gill and MacMillan | isbn = 0-7171-2945-4 }}</ref>\n\n[[File:O'Connells Home At Derrynane Abby.JPG|thumb|left|O'Connell's home at [[Derrynane House|Derrynane]]]]\nWhile in Dublin studying for the law, O'Connell was under his Uncle Maurice's instructions not to become involved in any militia activity. When [[Theobald Wolfe Tone|Wolfe Tone]]'s [[Wolfe Tone#Hoche's expedition and the 1798 rebellion|French invasion fleet]] entered [[Bantry Bay]] in December 1796, O'Connell found himself in a quandary. Politics was the cause of his unsettlement.<ref name=\"Gywnn\">\nDennis Gywnn, ''Daniel O'Connell The Irish Liberator'', Hutchinson & Co. Ltd pg 71</ref> Dennis Gwynn in his ''Daniel O'Connell: The Irish Liberator'' suggests that the unsettlement was because he was enrolled as a volunteer in defence of Government, yet the Government was intensifying its persecution of the Catholic people\u2014of which he was one.<ref name=\"Gywnn\" /> He desired to enter Parliament, yet every allowance that the Catholics had been led to anticipate, two years previously, was now flatly vetoed.<ref name=\"Gywnn\" />\n\nAs a law student, O'Connell was aware of his own talents, but the higher ranks of the Bar were closed to him. He read the ''[[Jockey Club]]'' as a picture of the governing class in England and was persuaded by it that, \"vice reigns triumphant in the English court at this day. The spirit of [[liberty]] shrinks to protect property from the attacks of French innovators. The corrupt higher orders tremble for their vicious enjoyments.\"<ref name=\"Gywnn\" />\n\nO'Connell's studies at the time had concentrated upon the legal and political history of Ireland, and the debates of the Historical Society concerned the records of governments, and from this he was to conclude, according to one of his biographers, \"in Ireland the whole policy of the Government was to repress the people and to maintain the ascendancy of a privileged and corrupt minority\".<ref name=\"Gywnn\" />\n\nOn 3 January 1797, in an atmosphere of alarm over the French invasion fleet in Bantry Bay, he wrote to his uncle saying that he was the last of his colleagues to join a volunteer corps and \"being young, active, healthy and single\" he could offer no plausible excuse.<ref>O'Connell Correspondence, Vol I, Letter No. 24a</ref> Later that month, for the sake of expediency, he joined the Lawyers' Artillery Corps.<ref>O'Ferrall, F., ''Daniel O'Connell, Dublin'', 1981, p. 12</ref>\n\nOn 19 May 1798, O'Connell was called to the [[Irish Bar]] and became a [[barrister]]. Four days later, the [[Society of the United Irishmen|United Irishmen]] staged their [[Irish Rebellion of 1798|rebellion]] which was put down by the British with great bloodshed. O'Connell did not support the rebellion; he believed that the Irish would have to assert themselves politically rather than by force.\n\nHe went on the [[Munster]] circuit, and for over a decade, he went into a fairly quiet period of private law practice in the south of Ireland.<ref name=\"Boylan1998\" /> He was reputed to have the largest income of any Irish barrister but, due to natural extravagance and a growing family, was usually in debt; his brother remarked caustically that Daniel was in debt all his life from the age of seventeen. Although he was ultimately to inherit Derrynane from his uncle Maurice, the old man lived to be almost 100 and in the event Daniel's inheritance did not cover his debts.\n\nHe also condemned [[Robert Emmet]]'s [[Irish Rebellion of 1803|Rebellion of 1803]]. Of Emmet, a Protestant, he wrote: \"A man who could coolly prepare so much bloodshed, so many murders\u2014and such horrors of every kind has ceased to be an object of compassion.\"<ref>O'Connell Correspondence, Vol I, Letter No. 97</ref>\n\nDespite his opposition to the use of violence, he was willing to defend those accused of political crimes, particularly if he suspected that they had been falsely accused, as in the [[Doneraile]] conspiracy trials of 1829, his last notable court appearance. He was noted for his fearlessness in court: if he thought poorly of a judge (as was very often the case) he had no hesitation in making this clear. Most famous perhaps was his retort to [[James McClelland (Solicitor-General)|Baron McClelland]], who had said that as a barrister he would never have taken the course O'Connell had adopted: O'Connell said that McClelland had never been his model as a barrister, neither would he take directions from him as a judge.<ref>O'Faol\u00e1in, Sean (1936). ''King of the Beggars: a life of Daniel O'Connell''. Alan Figgis reissue, p. 97</ref> He did not lack the ambition to become a judge himself: in particular he was attracted by the position of [[Master of the Rolls in Ireland]], yet although he was offered it more than once, finally refused.\n\n==Family==\n[[File:Mary O'Connell.tif|thumb| 1836 Portrait of Mary O'Connell by John Gubbins]]\n[[File:Daniel O'Connell.png|thumb|left|Daniel O'Connell, in an 1836 watercolour by Bernard Mulrenin. <!--''Daniel O'Connell'', 1836, by [[Bernard Mulrenin]]-->]]\n[[File:St Patricks Cathedral (Daniel O'Connell Statue).jpg|thumb|Statue of Daniel O'Connell outside [[St Patrick's Cathedral, Melbourne]]|alt=]]In 1802 O'Connell married his third cousin, [[Mary O'Connell (1778-1836)|Mary O'Connell]]. It was a love marriage, and to persist in it was an act of considerable courage, since Daniel's uncle Maurice was outraged (as Mary had no fortune) and for a time threatened to disinherit them.<ref>Geoghegan  ''King Dan''  pp.94\u20137</ref> They had four daughters (three surviving), [[Ellen Bridget O'Connell|Ellen]] (1805\u20131883), Catherine (1808), Elizabeth (1810), and Rickarda (1815) and four sons. The sons\u2014[[Maurice O'Connell (MP)|Maurice]] (1803), [[Morgan O'Connell|Morgan]]  (1804), [[John O'Connell (MP)|John]] (1810), and [[Daniel O'Connell Jnr|Daniel]] (1816)\u2014all sat in [[Parliament of the United Kingdom|Parliament]]. The marriage was happy and Mary's death in 1837 was a blow from which her husband never fully recovered. He was a devoted father; O'Faol\u00e1in suggests that despite his wide acquaintance he had few close friends and therefore the family circle meant a great deal to him.<ref>O'Faol\u00e1in p.87</ref>\n\n=== O'Connell's Ale and connection with the 'licensed trade' ===\nO'Connell assisted his younger son, Daniel junior, to acquire the Phoenix Brewery in James's Street, Dublin in 1831.<ref>''Irish Whiskey: A 1000 Year Tradition'', Malachy Magee, O'Brien Press, Dublin, {{ISBN|0-86278-228-7}}. pg 68\u201374.</ref> The brewery produced a brand known as \"O'Connell's Ale\" and enjoyed some popularity. By 1832, O'Connell was forced to state that he would not be a political patron of the brewing trade or his son's company, until he was no longer a member of parliament, particularly because O'Connell and [[Arthur Guinness]] were political enemies. Guinness was the \"moderate\" liberal candidate, O'Connell was the \"radical\" liberal candidate. The rivalry caused dozens of Irish firms to boycott Guinness during the 1841 Repeal election. It was at this time that Guinness was accused of supporting the \"Orange system\", and its beer was known as \"Protestant porter\". When the O'Connell family left brewing, the rights to \"O'Connell Dublin Ale\" was sold to John D'Arcy. The brewing business proved to be unsuccessful though, and after a few years was taken over by the manager, John Brennan, while Daniel junior embraced a political career. Brennan changed the name back to the Phoenix Brewery but continued to brew and sell O'Connell's Ale. When the Phoenix Brewery was effectively closed after being absorbed into the Guinness complex in 1909, the brewing of O'Connell's Ale was carried out by John D'Arcy and Son Ltd at the Anchor Brewery in Usher Street. In 1926, D'Arcy's ceased trading and the firm of Watkins, Jameson and Pim carried on the brewing until they too succumbed to the pressures of trying to compete with Guinness.<ref>T. Halpin: History of the Irish Brewing Industry, 1988</ref><ref name=\"sim\">[http://www.simtec.us/dublinbrewing/history.html History of Brewing in Dublin]</ref>\n\nDaniel junior was the committee chairman of the licensed trade association of the period and gave considerable and valuable support to Daniel O'Connell in his public life. Some time later a quarrel arose and O'Connell turned his back on the association and became a strong advocate of [[temperance movement|temperance]]. During the period of [[Theobald Mathew (temperance reformer)|Fr. Mathew]]'s total abstinence crusades many temperance rallies were held, the most notable being a huge rally held on [[St. Patrick's Day]] in 1841. Daniel O'Connell was a guest of honour at another such rally held at the [[Rotunda Hospital]].<ref name=\"sim\" /><ref>St Martin Magazine (ISSN 1393-1008), June 2003 St Martin Apostolate, Dublin</ref>\n\n== Political beliefs and programme ==\n[[File:Daniel O'Connell2.jpg|thumb|\"Daniel O'Connell: The Champion of Liberty\" poster published in [[Pennsylvania]], 1847]]\n\nA critic of violent insurrection ''in Ireland'', O'Connell once said that \"the altar of liberty totters when it is cemented only with blood\", and yet as late as 1841, O'Connell had whipped his MPs into line to keep the [[First Opium War|(First) Opium War]] going in China. The Tories at the time had proposed a motion of censure over the war, and O'Connell had to call upon his MPs to support the Whig Government. As a result of this intervention, the Government was saved.<ref>''[[Charles Gavan Duffy]]: Conversations With Carlyle (1892), with Introduction, Stray Thoughts on Young Ireland'', Brendan Clifford, Athol Books, Belfast, {{ISBN|0-85034-114-0}}.pg 17 &21</ref>\n\nPolitically, he focused on parliamentary and populist methods to force change and made regular declarations of his loyalty to the British Crown. He often warned the British establishment that if they did not reform the governance of Ireland, Irishmen would start to listen to the \"counsels of violent men\". Successive British governments continued to ignore this advice, long after his death, although he succeeded in extracting by the sheer force of will and the power of the Catholic peasants and clergy much of what he wanted, i.e., eliminating disabilities on Roman Catholics; ensuring that lawfully elected Roman Catholics could serve their constituencies in the British Parliament (until the [[Parliament of Ireland|Irish Parliament]] was restored); and amending the Oath of Allegiance so as to remove clauses offensive to Roman Catholics who could then take the Oath in good conscience.<ref name=\"Boylan1998\" />\n\nAlthough a native speaker of the [[Irish language]], O'Connell encouraged Irish people to learn English to better themselves.<ref name=\"Boylan1998\" /> Although he is best known for the campaign for Catholic emancipation; he also supported similar efforts for Irish Jews. At his insistence, in 1846, the British law \"[[History of the Jews in Ireland#18th and 19th century|De Judaismo]]\", which prescribed a special dress for Jews, was repealed. O'Connell said: \"Ireland has claims on your ancient race, it is the only country that I know of unsullied by any one act of persecution of the Jews\".<ref>[http://www.jewishireland.org/history_2.html Jewish Ireland] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100222092245/http://www.jewishireland.org/history_2.html|date=22 February 2010}}</ref>\n\n== Campaigning for Catholic emancipation ==\nO'Connell returned to politics in the 1810s. In 1811, he established the Catholic Board, which campaigned for [[Catholic emancipation]], that is, the opportunity for Irish Catholics to become members of parliament. In 1823, he set up the [[Catholic Association]] which embraced other aims to better Irish Catholics, such as: electoral reform, reform of the [[Church of Ireland]], tenants' rights, and economic development.<ref>Paul Adelmann and Robert Pearce, ''Great Britain and the Irish Question 1798\u20131922'', Hodder Murray, London, {{ISBN|0-340-88901-2}}, p. 33</ref>\n\nThe Association was funded by membership dues of one penny per month, a minimal amount designed to attract Catholic peasants. The subscription was highly successful, and the Association raised a large sum of money in its first year. The money was used to campaign for Catholic emancipation, specifically funding pro-emancipation members of parliament (MPs) standing for the [[British House of Commons]].<ref>Geoghegan, Patrick M. (2008). ''King Dan''. Gill and Macmillan, Dublin, p. 168</ref>\n\nThe Crown moved to suppress the Association by a series of prosecutions, with mixed success. O'Connell was often briefed for the defence, and showed extraordinary vigour in pleading the rights of Catholics to argue for emancipation. He clashed repeatedly with [[William Saurin]], the [[Attorney General for Ireland]] and most influential figure in the Dublin administration, and political differences between the two men were fuelled by a bitter personal antipathy.<ref>O'Faol\u00e1in pp. 151\u2013179</ref>\n\nIn 1815 a serious event in his life occurred. [[Dublin Corporation]] was considered a stronghold of the [[Protestant Ascendancy]] and O'Connell, in an 1815 speech, referred to it as a \"beggarly corporation\".<ref>{{cite book|last=Millingen|first=John Gideon|title=The history of duelling: including, narratives of the most remarkable personal encounters that have taken place from the earliest period to the present time, Volume 2|year=1841|publisher=R.

The duel had filled [[Dublin Castle]] (from where the [[Dublin Castle administration|British Government administered Ireland]]) with tense excitement at the prospect that O'Connell would be killed. They regarded O'Connell as \"worse than a public nuisance\", and would have welcomed any prospect of seeing him removed at this time.<ref name=\"Dennis Gywnn Pg 138-145\">Dennis Gywnn, ''Daniel O'Connell The Irish Liberator'', Hutchinson & Co. Ltd pp 138\u2013145</ref>\n\nO'Connell met D'Esterre and [[Oughter Ard#Duel|mortally wounded him]] (he was shot in the hip, the bullet then lodging in his stomach), in a duel at [[Oughterard, County Kildare]]. His conscience was bitterly sore by the fact that, not only had he killed a man, but he had left his family almost destitute.<ref>Geoghegan, ''King Dan''  p. 155</ref>\n\nO'Connell offered to \"share his income\" with D'Esterre's widow, but she declined; however, she consented to accept an allowance for her daughter, which O'Connell regularly paid for more than thirty years until his death. The memory of the duel haunted him for the remainder of his life, and he refused ever to fight another, being prepared to risk accusations of cowardice rather than kill again.<ref name=\"Dennis Gywnn Pg 138-145\" />\n\nAs part of his campaign for Catholic emancipation, O'Connell created the Catholic Association in 1823; this organisation acted as a pressure group against the British government so as to achieve emancipation. The [[Catholic Rent]], which was established in 1824 by O'Connell and the Catholic Church raised funds from which O'Connell was able to help finance the Catholic Association in its push for emancipation. Official opinion was gradually swinging towards emancipation, as shown by the summary dismissal of William Saurin, the Attorney General and a leading opponent of religious toleration, whom O'Connell called \"our mortal foe\".\n\nO'Connell stood in a [[1828 Clare by-election|by-election]] to the British House of Commons in 1828 for [[Clare (UK Parliament constituency)|County Clare]] against [[William Vesey-FitzGerald, 2nd Baron FitzGerald and Vesey|William Vesey Fitzgerald]], who had just joined the British Cabinet as President of the Board of Trade. By law at the time, Cabinet office was deemed to be \"an office of profit\" under the Crown, requiring the promoted man to obtain the endorsement of his constituents by standing for re-election.\n\nAfter O'Connell won election, he was unable to take his seat as members of parliament had to take the [[Oath of Supremacy]], which was incompatible with Catholicism. The Prime Minister, the [[Arthur Wellesley, 1st Duke of Wellington|Duke of Wellington]], and the [[Home Secretary]], Sir [[Robert Peel]], even though they opposed Catholic participation in Parliament, saw that denying O'Connell his seat would cause outrage and could lead to another rebellion or uprising in Ireland, which was about 85% Catholic.<ref>Oliver MacDonagh (1991), ''The Life of Daniel O'Connell''</ref>\n\nPeel and Wellington managed to convince [[George IV of the United Kingdom|King George IV]] that Catholic emancipation and the right of Catholics and [[Presbyterian]]s and members of all Christian faiths other than the established [[Church of Ireland]] to sit in Parliament needed to be established; with the help of the [[Whig (British political party)|Whigs]], the [[Roman Catholic Relief Act 1829|Catholic Relief Act]] became law in 1829.\n\nHowever, the Emancipation Act was not made retroactive, meaning that O'Connell had either to seek re-election or to attempt to take the oath of supremacy. When O'Connell attempted on 15 May to take his seat without taking the oath of supremacy,  Solicitor-General [[Nicholas Conyngham Tindal]] moved that his seat be declared vacant and another election ordered; O'Connell was elected unopposed on 30 July 1829.<ref name=\"Hist Parl\">''[[The History of Parliament]] 1820\u20131832'' vol VI pp. 535\u2013536.</ref>\n\nHe took his seat when Parliament resumed in February 1830, by which time [[Henry Charles Howard, 13th Duke of Norfolk]] and Earl of Surrey, had already become the first Roman Catholic to have taken advantage of the Emancipation Act and sit in Parliament.<ref name=\"Not first\">''[[History of Parliament]] 1820\u20131832'' vol I p. 253.</ref><ref name=\"Not first2\">{{cite web|url=http://www.deskeenan.com/1GrChap8.htm|title=The Grail Chapter Eight|work=deskeenan.com}}</ref>\n\n\"Wellington is the King of England\", King George IV once complained, \"O'Connell is King of Ireland, and I am only the dean of Windsor.\" The regal jest expressed the general admiration for O'Connell at the height of his career.\n\nThe Catholic emancipation campaign led by O'Connell served as the precedent and model for the emancipation of [[British Jews]], the subsequent [[Jews Relief Act 1858]] allowing Jewish MPs to omit the words in the [[Oath of Allegiance]] \"and I make this Declaration upon the true Faith of a Christian\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/Vict/21-22/49/enacted|title=Jews Relief Act 1858|work=legislation.gov.uk}}</ref> O'Connell himself was an opponent of the persecution of Jews praising Ireland as the \"only Christian country that I know of unsullied by any one act of persecution of the Jews.<ref>{{Cite web | url=https://books.google.com/?id=CkULAAAAIAAJ&q=Ireland+has+claims+on+your+ancient+race,+it+is+the+only+country+that+I+know+of+unsullied+by+any+one+act+of+persecution+of+the+Jews%E2%80%9D&dq=Ireland+has+claims+on+your+ancient+race,+it+is+the+only+country+that+I+know+of+unsullied+by+any+one+act+of+persecution+of+the+Jews%E2%80%9D | title=Transactions - the Jewish Historical Society of England| year=1908}}</ref>\n\n===Comments on emancipation===\n[[Michael Doheny]], in his ''The Felon's Track'', says that the very character of emancipation has assumed an \"exaggerated and false guise\" and that it is an error to call it emancipation.

There was an obligation for those working the land to support the established Church (i.e., the [[United Church of England and Ireland]]) by payments known as [[tithes]]. The fact that the vast majority of those working the land in Ireland were Catholic or Presbyterian tenant farmers, supporting what was a minority religion within that island (but not the United Kingdom as a whole), had been causing tension for some time.<ref name=ste>{{cite book|last=Stewart|first= Jay Brown |year=2001|title=The National Churches of England, Ireland and Scotland, 1801\u201346|pages=20\u201345|location=Oxford|publisher= Oxford University Press|isbn= 0-19-924235-6}}</ref>\n\nIn December 1830, he and several others were tried for holding a meeting as an association or assemblage in violation of the orders of the Lord Lieutenant of Ireland, but the statute expired in course of judgment and the prosecution was terminated by the judiciary.<ref>State Trials (New Series) II, 629</ref>\n\nAn initially peaceful campaign of non-payment turned violent in 1831 when the newly founded [[Royal Irish Constabulary|Irish Constabulary]] were used to seize property in lieu of payment resulting in the [[Tithe War]] of 1831\u20131836.\n\nAlthough opposed to the use of force, O'Connell successfully defended participants in the [[Tithe War|Battle of Carrickshock]] and all the defendants were acquitted. Nonetheless O'Connell rejected [[William Sharman Crawford]]'s call for the complete abolition of tithes in 1838, as he felt he could not embarrass the Whigs (the [[Lichfield House Compact]] secured an alliance between Whigs, radicals and Irish MPs in 1835).<ref name=ste/> In 1838, parliament introduced a {{anchor|Tithe Commutation Act}}Tithe Commutation Act for Ireland.<ref>{{cite book|editor1=Moody, T.

They in turn were to pass payment to the authorities. Tithes were thus effectively added to a tenant's rent payment. This partial relief and elimination of the confrontational collections ended the violent aspect of the Tithe War.\n\nFull relief from the tax was not achieved until the [[Irish Church Act 1869]], which disestablished the Church of Ireland, by the [[William Ewart Gladstone|Gladstone]] government.\n\n\nIn 1841, Daniel O'Connell became the first Roman Catholic [[Lord Mayor of Dublin]] since the reign of [[James II of England|James II]], who had been the last Roman Catholic monarch of England, Ireland and Scotland.<ref name=\"Boylan1998\" />\n\n==Campaign for repeal of the Union==\n[[Image:The Monster Meeting at Clifden in 1843.png|thumb|''The Monster Meeting at [[Clifden]] in 1843'' by [[Joseph Patrick Haverty]].

To campaign for repeal, O'Connell set up the [[Repeal Association]]. He argued for the re-creation of an independent Kingdom of Ireland to govern itself, with [[Victoria of the United Kingdom|Queen Victoria]] as the Queen of Ireland.\n\nTo push for this, he held a series of \"Monster Meetings\" throughout much of Ireland outside the Protestant and Unionist-dominated province of [[Ulster]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.bartleby.com/268/6/17.html|title=In Favor of the Repeal of the Union by Daniel O'Connell.

Clontarf was symbolic because of its association with the [[Battle of Clontarf]] in 1014, when the Irish King [[Brian Boru]] defeated his rival Maelmordha, although Brian himself died during the battle. Despite appeals from his supporters, O'Connell refused to defy the authorities and he called off the meeting, as he was unwilling to risk bloodshed and had no others.<ref name=\"Boylan1998\" /> He was arrested, charged with conspiracy and sentenced to a year's imprisonment and a fine of \u00a32,000, although he was released after three months by the [[House of Lords]], which quashed the conviction and severely criticised the unfairness of the trial.

Wales played its first fixture in March 1876, four years after [[Scotland national football team|Scotland]] and [[England national football team|England]] had contested the first-ever international match. The team played annual fixtures against Scotland, England, and later [[Ireland national football team (1882\u20131950)|Ireland]] and these were eventually organised into the [[British Home Championship]], an annual competition between the [[Home Nations]]. Wales did not win its first championship until the [[1906\u201307 British Home Championship|1906\u201307 edition]] of the competition and the triumph remained the nation's only one before the First World War. Wales improved considerably in the post-war period, and claimed three titles during the 1920s, despite the team was often hindered by the reluctance of [[English Football League|Football League]] clubs to release its players for international duty. The situation was so grave that, in the early 1930s, Wales was forced to select a team of lower league and amateur players in a side that became known as \"Keenor and the 10 unknowns\", a reference to captain [[Fred Keenor]] and the relative obscurity of his teammates.\n\nAble to call upon its strongest side, Wales enjoyed its most successful period in the British Home Championship, winning four titles in the six years before the Second World War. When competitive football resumed after the war, Wales began facing opponents from farther afield and played matches against numerous other European nations for the first time. The side also began competing in qualification groups for the [[FIFA World Cup]], but failed to qualify for the [[1950 FIFA World Cup|1950]] and [[1954 FIFA World Cup|1954]] editions. Under manager [[Jimmy Murphy (footballer)|Jimmy Murphy]], Wales qualified for its first World Cup in [[1958 FIFA World Cup|1958]] and progressed from its group before being defeated by [[Brazil national football team|Brazil]] in the quarter-final in its following match. \n\nThe side suffered a decline in the 1960s as the 1958 World Cup generation gradually retired. [[Dave Bowen]] replaced Murphy and managed the team for a decade on a part-time basis but enjoyed little success, failing to qualify for a World Cup or the early editions of the [[UEFA European Championship|European Nations' Cup]] (later known as the European Championships). He did help the side to share the British Home Championship during the [[1969\u201370 British Home Championship|1969\u201370 season]], the last time Wales won the tournament before the competition was discontinued. In total, Wales won the championship 12 times, sharing five titles. \n\nBowen left the role in 1974, having turned down the chance to take the position full-time. He was replaced by Englishman [[Mike Smith (football manager)|Mike Smith]] who led the side to the quarter-finals of [[UEFA Euro 1976]] in its centenary year, before being defeated by [[Yugoslavia national football team|Yugoslavia]].{{#tag:ref|For the 1976 tournament, quarter-finals were played as a two-legged, home and away tie with the finals hosting only the semi-finals and beyond.<ref name=\"1976rsssf\"/>|group=lower-alpha}}\n\n==Formation and early matches==\n[[File:Wales V Scotland 3386999.tif|thumb|A newspaper report of Wales' first competitive match against Scotland in 1876|alt=A newspaper report of a football match]]\nThe [[1872 Scotland v England football match|first]] official international [[association football]] match was held in November 1872 between [[Scotland national football team|Scotland]] and [[England national football team|England]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/scotland/sportscotland/asportingnation/article/0012/ |title=The first international football match |publisher=BBC |last=Mitchell |first=Paul |accessdate=25 November 2019}}</ref> Four years later, G.

In November of the same year, Roose suffered a broken arm while playing for his club side but declared himself fit for the British Home Championship internationals in March 1911.

Davies scored again in Wales' second match, a 2\u20131 victory over England with [[Ted Vizard]] scoring the winning goal. A final victory over Ireland, via a [[Moses Russell]] penalty, secured the title for Wales having beaten all three sides in the same tournament for the first time.<ref>{{harvnb|Stead|2013|pp=98\u201399}}</ref> The success was partly attributed to the team's star players being released to play, but this trend soon reverted to type for the opening match of the [[1924\u201325 British Home Championship|1924\u201325 tournament]]; six players withdrew from the squad for the opening match, a 3\u20131 defeat to Scotland.

The refusal of clubs to release players for international duty or to not allow a player to travel until a day before the match often disrupted the team. In his book ''Red Dragons: The Story of Welsh Football'', Phil Stead writes that Dave Bowen often could \"not pick a side until the day of the game because he was never sure who would be available.\"<ref name=\"s195197\">{{harvnb|Stead|2013|pp=195\u2013197}}</ref> The final match of the 1970 World Cup qualification group against Italy was nearly forfeited as Wales struggled to name a squad.

Sprake later admitted to feigning injury under the guidance of his club manager [[Don Revie]] in order to avoid selection with the national side.<ref name=\"s186187\"/> [[John Toshack]], who made his debut in 1969, made similar comments: \"The whole set-up was a bit of a shambles [...] some of the players with more fashionable clubs were not too concerned about turning up for the less glamorous games.\"<ref name=\"s186187\"/> An incident in 1969 drew considerable criticism of the FAW when it failed to book enough seats for the ten travelling Welsh players and the organisation's members. When none of the officials offered to give up their seat, the crew declared that the last person to board the craft, winger [[Gil Reece]], would have to disembark.

Wales played its first fixture in March 1876, four years after [[Scotland national football team|Scotland]] and [[England national football team|England]] had contested the first-ever international match. The team played annual fixtures against Scotland, England, and later [[Ireland national football team (1882\u20131950)|Ireland]] and these were eventually organised into the [[British Home Championship]], an annual competition between the [[Home Nations]]. Wales did not win its first championship until the [[1906\u201307 British Home Championship|1906\u201307 edition]] of the competition and the triumph remained the nation's only one before the First World War. Wales improved considerably in the post-war period, and claimed three titles during the 1920s, despite the team was often hindered by the reluctance of [[English Football League|Football League]] clubs to release its players for international duty. The situation was so grave that, in the early 1930s, Wales was forced to select a team of lower league and amateur players in a side that became known as \"Keenor and the 10 unknowns\", a reference to captain [[Fred Keenor]] and the relative obscurity of his teammates.\n\nAble to call upon its strongest side, Wales enjoyed its most successful period in the British Home Championship, winning four titles in the six years before the Second World War. When competitive football resumed after the war, Wales began facing opponents from farther afield and played matches against numerous other European nations for the first time. The side also began competing in qualification groups for the [[FIFA World Cup]], but failed to qualify for the [[1950 FIFA World Cup|1950]] and [[1954 FIFA World Cup|1954]] editions. Under manager [[Jimmy Murphy (footballer)|Jimmy Murphy]], Wales qualified for its first World Cup in [[1958 FIFA World Cup|1958]] and progressed from its group before being defeated by [[Brazil national football team|Brazil]] in the quarter-final in its following match. \n\nThe side suffered a decline in the 1960s as the 1958 World Cup generation gradually retired. [[Dave Bowen]] replaced Murphy and managed the team for a decade on a part-time basis but enjoyed little success, failing to qualify for a World Cup or the early editions of the [[UEFA European Championship|European Nations' Cup]] (later known as the European Championships). He did help the side to share the British Home Championship during the [[1969\u201370 British Home Championship|1969\u201370 season]], the last time Wales won the tournament before the competition was discontinued. In total, Wales won the championship 12 times, sharing five titles. \n\nBowen left the role in 1974, having turned down the chance to take the position full-time. He was replaced by Englishman [[Mike Smith (football manager)|Mike Smith]] who led the side to the quarter-finals of [[UEFA Euro 1976]] in its centenary year, before being defeated by [[Yugoslavia national football team|Yugoslavia]].{{#tag:ref|For the 1976 tournament, quarter-finals were played as a two-legged, home and away tie with the finals hosting only the semi-finals and beyond.<ref name=\"1976rsssf\"/>|group=lower-alpha}}\n\n==Formation and early matches==\n[[File:Wales V Scotland 3386999.tif|thumb|A newspaper report of Wales' first competitive match against Scotland in 1876|alt=A newspaper report of a football match]]\nThe [[1872 Scotland v England football match|first]] official international [[association football]] match was held in November 1872 between [[Scotland national football team|Scotland]] and [[England national football team|England]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/scotland/sportscotland/asportingnation/article/0012/ |title=The first international football match |publisher=BBC |last=Mitchell |first=Paul |accessdate=25 November 2019}}</ref> Four years later, G.

The refusal of clubs to release players for international duty or to not allow a player to travel until a day before the match often disrupted the team.

O'Brian himself was present, and he casually mentioned to ''Rose''{{'}}s captain Richard Bailey that if ''Rose'' were painted in an 1805 colour scheme she would be a \"dead ringer\" for the frigate ''Surprise'' that appeared in his books. Bailey quickly ordered his crew to get out the paint and make the changes. O'Brian was so impressed that he changed his mind about his prohibition of having any of his books converted into film, and Norton immediately started looking for a Hollywood production company.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Millar|first1=John Fitzhugh|title=Building the Replicas of Revolutionary War Ships Rose and Providence|url=http://smallstatebighistory.com/building-replicas-revolutionary-war-ships-rose-providence/|website=smallstatebighistory|accessdate=26 December 2017}}</ref>\n[[File:HMS Rose - 1971 under sail off Massachusetts.png|thumb|200px|right|Replica HMS ''Rose'' off Massachusetts in 1971, the hull painted as her namesake]]\n\n==Transformation into HMS ''Surprise''==\n\nThe ship was sold to the [[20th Century Fox]] film studio in March 2001,<ref>{{cite web|last1=Cummings|first1=Bill|title=Goodbye, Rose: Filmmaker Pays $1.5m for Bridgeport Frigate|url=http://www.peterweircave.com/master/rose1.html|accessdate=17 December 2017}}</ref> and underwent extensive modifications to be used in the making of the film ''[[Master and Commander: The Far Side of the World]]'', in which she portrayed the [[Royal Navy]] frigate HMS {{HMS|Surprise|1796|2}} with a story based on several of the books by Patrick O'Brian.
