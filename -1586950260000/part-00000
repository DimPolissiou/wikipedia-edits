Such Rebuilt toasters bear the suffix 'R' to their road numbers.           \n\n<br />     \n\n== Sheds that hold WDP- 3A ==\nThe following loco sheds have stabled this locomotive type: \n[[File:Trivandrum rajdhani.jpg|alt=|thumb|300x300px|left|GOC WDP-3A with Thiruvananthapuram Rajdhani Express]]\n[[File:WDP3A c 15543 PUSHPAK.jpg|alt=|thumb|Tughlakabad WDP-3A]]\n\n* [[Kalyan Junction railway station|Kalyan]] (KYN)- 10\n* [[Golden Rock railway station|Golden Rock]] (GOC)- 9\n* [[Izzatnagar railway station|Izzatnagar]] (IZN), all of which were previously homed at [[Tughlakabad railway station|Tughlakabad]] (TKD)- 20<br />'''Total Active Locomotives in Service as of 01-03-2020:''' 39<br />('''Note-'''Before updating the information here anybody should check out the railways current official data first in the  '''Source''' link then change the data.) \n<br />'''Source:''' http://www.indianrailways.gov.in/railwayboard/view_section.jsp?lang=0&id=0,1,304,366,541,710,717\n\n[[File:Monsoon Train - Flickr - Dr. Santulan Mahanta.jpg|thumb|KYN WDP-3A hauling the Mumbai-Karmali Tejas Express]]\n\n== See also ==\n\n* [[History of rail transport in India]]\n* [[Indian Railways]]\n* [[Locomotives of India]]\n* [[Rail transport in India]]\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist}}\n\n{{Broad gauge locomotives of India|state=open}}\n\n[[Category:Diesel-electric locomotives of India]]\n[[Category:DLW locomotives]]\n[[Category:Co-Co locomotives]]\n[[Category:5 ft 6 in gauge locomotives]]\n[[Category:Railway locomotives introduced in 1994]]\n", "name_user": "Materialscientist", "label": "unsafe", "comment": "(Reverted edits by150.129.132.82(talk) to last version by Richard Lee Keiffer)", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indian_locomotive_class_WDP-3A"}

It was released on July 11, 2003, in the United States, and distributed by [[20th Century Fox]]. It was directed by [[Stephen Norrington]] and starred [[Sean Connery]] (in his final live-action role before retiring), [[Naseeruddin Shah]], [[Peta Wilson]], [[Tony Curran]], [[Stuart Townsend]], [[Shane West]], [[Jason Flemyng]] and [[Richard Roxburgh]].\n\nAs with the comic book source material, the film features prominent [[pastiche]] and [[Fictional crossover|crossover]] themes<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.allmovie.com/movie/the-league-of-extraordinary-gentlemen-v281053|work=Allmovie|title=The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen|author=Tobey, Matthew|accessdate=November 10, 2012}}</ref> set in the late 19th century.  It features an assortment of fictional literary characters appropriate to the period who act as [[Victorian era]] [[superhero]]es. It draws on the works of [[Jules Verne]], [[H. G. Wells]], [[Bram Stoker]], [[Sir Arthur Conan Doyle]], [[H. Rider Haggard]], [[Ian Fleming]], [[Herman Melville]], [[Oscar Wilde]], [[Robert Louis Stevenson]], [[Edgar Allan Poe]], [[Gaston Leroux]] and [[Mark Twain]], albeit all adapted for the film.\n\nThe film grossed over $175&nbsp;million worldwide at the box office, rental revenue of $48.6&nbsp;million, and DVD sales as of 2003 at $36.4&nbsp;million.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.the-numbers.com/movies/2003/TLOEG.php|title=The Numbers: Box Office Data|publisher=|accessdate=October 4, 2014}}</ref>\n\n==Plot==\nIn 1899, a [[Terrorism|terrorist group]] led by the [[Fant\u00f4mas|Fantom]] break into the [[Bank of England]] to steal [[Leonardo da Vinci]]'s blueprints of [[Venice]]'s foundations and kidnap several [[German Empire|German]] scientists. The [[British Empire]] sends Sanderson Reed to [[Kenya Colony]] to recruit adventurer and hunter [[Allan Quatermain]], who had retired following the death of his son. Quatermain at first refuses until a group of assassins are sent to kill him, resulting in the death of his longtime friend, Nigel. In [[London]], Quatermain meets \"[[M (James Bond)|M]]\", who reveals that the Fantom plans to start a [[World War I|world war]] by bombing a secret meeting of world leaders in Venice. To prevent this, M is forming the latest generation of the [[History of The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen|League of Extraordinary Gentlemen]], consisting of Quatermain, [[Captain Nemo]], [[Vampire|vampiric]] chemist [[Mina Harker]], and [[The Invisible Man|invisible thief Rodney Skinner]].\n\nThe League travel to the [[London Docklands|London docks]] to recruit [[Dorian Gray]], Mina's former lover who is immortal due to a missing portrait. The Fantom's assassins attack, but the League fend them off, aided by [[U.S. Secret Service]] Agent [[Tom Sawyer]]. Dorian and Sawyer join the League. They then capture [[Edward Hyde (fictional character)|Edward Hyde]] in [[Paris]], who transforms back into his alter ego [[Dr. Jekyll]] and joins the League after being offered [[amnesty]]. The League travel to Venice in Nemo's [[submarine]], the ''[[Nautilus (Verne)|Nautilus]]'', but it soon becomes clear there may be a [[Mole (espionage)|mole]] on board: a camera's [[flash powder]] residue is found in the wheelhouse, and one of Jekyll's transformation formulas disappears. Suspicion falls on the missing Skinner.\n\nThe ''Nautilus'' arrives in Venice just as the bombs go off, causing the city to start collapsing in a [[domino effect]]. Sawyer uses Nemo's automobile to stop the destruction, while Quatermain confronts the Fantom, who is unmasked as M. Dorian is also revealed to be the traitor, who then murders Nemo's [[Chief mate|first mate]] [[Ishmael (Moby-Dick)|Ishmael]] and steals the ''Nautilus''{{'s}} exploration pod. M and Dorian leave a [[phonograph]] recording for the League revealing that their true goal is to ignite the world war, and that Dorian has been collecting physical elements of the League to create Nautiloid, heavily armed version of the ''Nautilus'', invisible spies, army like-Hyde, vampiric assassins and to sell the superhuman formulas off to the highest bidder. The ''Nautilus'' is damaged by bombs hidden on board, but Hyde saves it by draining the flooded engine rooms. Skinner sends a message to the League, revealing he has snuck aboard the exploration pod and telling them to follow his heading.\n\nThe League reach northern [[Mongolia]], where they reunite with Skinner and plot to destroy M's factory with explosives. Nemo and Hyde rescue the scientists, Skinner sets the explosive charges, and Mina battles and eventually kills Dorian by exposing him to his portrait. Quatermain and Sawyer confront M, identifying him as [[Professor James Moriarty]], [[Sherlock Holmes]]'s archenemy who had taken on a new alias following his [[The Final Problem|alleged death]] at the [[Reichenbach Falls]]. Sawyer is taken hostage by an invisible Reed; Quatermain shoots the latter, only to be fatally stabbed by Moriarty. Moriarty flees outside, but Sawyer successfully shoots him, and the formulas sink into the icy water. Quatermain then dies.\n\nQuatermain is buried beside his son in Kenya. The surviving League members recall how a [[witch doctor]] had blessed Quatermain for saving his village, promising that [[Africa]] would never let him die. The remaining League members depart, agreeing to continue using their powers for good in the [[20th century|new century]]. Following this, the witch doctor arrives and performs a ritual that summons an unnatural storm, with a bolt of lightning striking the rifle Sawyer left on Quatermain's grave.\n\n== Cast ==\n* [[Sean Connery]] as [[Allan Quatermain]]\n* [[Naseeruddin Shah]] as [[Captain Nemo]]\n* [[Peta Wilson]] as [[Mina Harker]]\n* [[Tony Curran]] as [[Rodney Skinner]]\n* [[Stuart Townsend]] as [[Dorian Gray]]\n* [[Shane West]] as [[Tom Sawyer]]\n* [[Jason Flemyng]] as [[The Strange Case of Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde|Dr. Henry Jekyll / Edward Hyde]]\n* [[Richard Roxburgh]] as [[Phantom of the Opera|The Fantom]] / \"[[M (James Bond)|M\"]] / [[Professor Moriarty|Professor James Moriarty]]\n* [[Max Ryan]] as Dante\n* [[Tom Goodman-Hill]] as Sanderson Reed\n* [[David Hemmings]] as Nigel\n* [[Terry O'Neill (martial artist)|Terry O'Neill]] as [[Ishmael (Moby-Dick)|Ishmael]]\n\n==Production==\n===Writing===\nFor the script, the character \"The Invisible Man\" was changed to \"An Invisible Man\" since Fox was unable to obtain the rights to the title character of [[H. G. Wells]]' ''[[The Invisible Man]]'', and his name was changed from \"Hawley Griffin\" to \"Rodney Skinner\". The [[Fu Manchu]] character was also dropped from the script. At Fox's request, the character of [[Tom Sawyer]] was added for [[United States|American]] audiences and to give the movie some \"youth appeal\". Producer [[Don Murphy]], who described the request as a \"stupid studio note\", later said that the move to add Sawyer was \"brilliant\".<ref name=\"lat\"/>\n\n===Casting===\nAfter Sean Connery previously declined the roles of the [[Architect (The Matrix)|Architect]] in ''[[The Matrix (franchise)|The Matrix]]'' trilogy and [[Gandalf]] in ''[[The Lord of the Rings (film series)|The Lord of the Rings]]'' trilogy, the latter of which would have reportedly earned him $450 million, he agreed to appear as Quatermain despite not understanding the script.<ref>Norrington, Stephen (Director) (December 16, 2003).

It features an assortment of fictional literary characters appropriate to the period who act as [[Victorian era]] [[superhero]]es. It draws on the works of [[Jules Verne]], [[H. G. Wells]], [[Bram Stoker]], [[Sir Arthur Conan Doyle]], [[H. Rider Haggard]], [[Ian Fleming]], [[Herman Melville]], [[Oscar Wilde]], [[Robert Louis Stevenson]], [[Edgar Allan Poe]], [[Gaston Leroux]] and [[Mark Twain]], albeit all adapted for the film.\n\nThe film grossed over $175&nbsp;million worldwide at the box office, rental revenue of $48.6&nbsp;million, and DVD sales as of 2003 at $36.4&nbsp;million.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.the-numbers.com/movies/2003/TLOEG.php|title=The Numbers: Box Office Data|publisher=|accessdate=October 4, 2014}}</ref>\n\n==Plot==\nIn 1899, a [[Terrorism|terrorist group]] led by the [[Fant\u00f4mas|Fantom]] break into the [[Bank of England]] to steal [[Leonardo da Vinci]]'s blueprints of [[Venice]]'s foundations and kidnap several [[German Empire|German]] scientists. The [[British Empire]] sends Sanderson Reed to [[Kenya Colony]] to recruit adventurer and hunter [[Allan Quatermain]], who had retired following the death of his son. Quatermain at first refuses until a group of assassins are sent to kill him, resulting in the death of his longtime friend, Nigel. In [[London]], Quatermain meets \"[[M (James Bond)|M]]\", who reveals that the Fantom plans to start a [[World War I|world war]] by bombing a secret meeting of world leaders in Venice. To prevent this, M is forming the latest generation of the [[History of The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen|League of Extraordinary Gentlemen]], consisting of Quatermain, [[Captain Nemo]], [[Vampire|vampiric]] chemist [[Mina Harker]], and [[The Invisible Man|invisible thief Rodney Skinner]].\n\nThe League travel to the [[London Docklands|London docks]] to recruit [[Dorian Gray]], Mina's former lover who is immortal due to a missing portrait. The Fantom's assassins attack, but the League fend them off, aided by [[U.S. Secret Service]] Agent [[Tom Sawyer]]. Dorian and Sawyer join the League. They then capture [[Edward Hyde (fictional character)|Edward Hyde]] in [[Paris]], who transforms back into his alter ego [[Dr. Jekyll]] and joins the League after being offered [[amnesty]]. The League travel to Venice in Nemo's [[submarine]], the ''[[Nautilus (Verne)|Nautilus]]'', but it soon becomes clear there may be a [[Mole (espionage)|mole]] on board: a camera's [[flash powder]] residue is found in the wheelhouse, and one of Jekyll's transformation formulas disappears. Suspicion falls on the missing Skinner.\n\nThe ''Nautilus'' arrives in Venice just as the bombs go off, causing the city to start collapsing in a [[domino effect]]. Sawyer uses Nemo's automobile to stop the destruction, while Quatermain confronts the Fantom, who is unmasked as M. Dorian is also revealed to be the traitor, who then murders Nemo's [[Chief mate|first mate]] [[Ishmael (Moby-Dick)|Ishmael]] and steals the ''Nautilus''{{'s}} exploration pod. M and Dorian leave a [[phonograph]] recording for the League revealing that their true goal is to ignite the world war, and that Dorian has been collecting physical elements of the League to create a heavily armed version of the ''Nautilus'', invisible spies, vampire assassins, and Hyde-like soldiers, and to sell the superhuman formulas off to the highest bidder. The ''Nautilus'' is damaged by bombs hidden on board, but Hyde saves it by draining the flooded engine rooms. Skinner sends a message to the League, revealing he has snuck aboard the exploration pod and telling them to follow his heading.\n\nThe League reach northern [[Mongolia]], where they reunite with Skinner and plot to destroy M's factory with explosives. Nemo and Hyde rescue the scientists, Skinner sets the explosive charges, and Mina battles and eventually kills Dorian by exposing him to his portrait. Quatermain and Sawyer confront M, identifying him as [[Professor James Moriarty]], [[Sherlock Holmes]]'s archenemy who had taken on a new alias following his [[The Final Problem|alleged death]] at the [[Reichenbach Falls]]. Sawyer is taken hostage by an invisible Reed; Quatermain shoots the latter, only to be fatally stabbed by Moriarty. Moriarty flees outside, but Sawyer successfully shoots him, and the formulas sink into the icy water. Quatermain then dies.\n\nQuatermain is buried beside his son in Kenya. The surviving League members recall how a [[witch doctor]] had blessed Quatermain for saving his village, promising that [[Africa]] would never let him die. The remaining League members depart, agreeing to continue using their powers for good in the [[20th century|new century]]. Following this, the witch doctor arrives and performs a ritual that summons an unnatural storm, with a bolt of lightning striking the rifle Sawyer left on Quatermain's grave.\n\n== Cast ==\n* [[Sean Connery]] as [[Allan Quatermain]]\n* [[Naseeruddin Shah]] as [[Captain Nemo]]\n* [[Peta Wilson]] as [[Mina Harker]]\n* [[Tony Curran]] as [[Rodney Skinner]]\n* [[Stuart Townsend]] as [[Dorian Gray]]\n* [[Shane West]] as [[Tom Sawyer]]\n* [[Jason Flemyng]] as [[The Strange Case of Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde|Dr. Henry Jekyll / Edward Hyde]]\n* [[Richard Roxburgh]] as [[Phantom of the Opera|The Fantom]] / \"[[M (James Bond)|M\"]] / [[Professor Moriarty|Professor James Moriarty]]\n* [[Max Ryan]] as Dante\n* [[Tom Goodman-Hill]] as Sanderson Reed\n* [[David Hemmings]] as Nigel\n* [[Terry O'Neill (martial artist)|Terry O'Neill]] as [[Ishmael (Moby-Dick)|Ishmael]]\n\n==Production==\n===Writing===\nFor the script, the character \"The Invisible Man\" was changed to \"An Invisible Man\" since Fox was unable to obtain the rights to the title character of [[H. G. Wells]]' ''[[The Invisible Man]]'', and his name was changed from \"Hawley Griffin\" to \"Rodney Skinner\". The [[Fu Manchu]] character was also dropped from the script. At Fox's request, the character of [[Tom Sawyer]] was added for [[United States|American]] audiences and to give the movie some \"youth appeal\". Producer [[Don Murphy]], who described the request as a \"stupid studio note\", later said that the move to add Sawyer was \"brilliant\".<ref name=\"lat\"/>\n\n===Casting===\nAfter Sean Connery previously declined the roles of the [[Architect (The Matrix)|Architect]] in ''[[The Matrix (franchise)|The Matrix]]'' trilogy and [[Gandalf]] in ''[[The Lord of the Rings (film series)|The Lord of the Rings]]'' trilogy, the latter of which would have reportedly earned him $450 million, he agreed to appear as Quatermain despite not understanding the script.<ref>Norrington, Stephen (Director) (December 16, 2003).

Another version is that chickens were so abundant in the town that hawks swept down on the place to snatch chicks from their mothers. When hawks flew overhead, as warning to their neighborhood, people shouted \u201cHawk Manok\u201d or \u201cLawin-Manok\u201d.\n\nOn January 1, 1917 the village of Laguimanoc, which was formerly a barrio of Atimonan, became a municipality. Ten years after, the town\u2019s council changed the name to Padre Burgos, in honor of one of the country\u2019s martyrs, [[gomburza|Fr. Jose P. Burgos]]. The streets were named after local leaders who rendered valuable services to the community. Because of the physical and topographic conditions of the town, four sitios where clusters of houses were became the main district of the town namely Campo, Burgos, Basiao and Bundok-Punta. The community converged to be in this particular spot because of its sea which made this town as port of Laguimanoc. In the early days this port offered a good wharf for vessels plying between Manila and southern Luzon. This was also a port of call for ships exporting lumber to Europe during the Spanish regime. In this town was the residence of the \u201cAlcalde Mar\u201d or Port Officer.\n\nBusiness and other industries prospered and people conglomerated in this spot. Spots of the historical interest are the wharf symbol of commercial progress, the old church with the old-fashioned \u201ccanyon\u201d markers of the people\u2019s religious faith, the Bag Cement Slabs and Stone quarries mute testimonies of the effervescent power and grandeur of the early foreign settlers, the hills near the railroad station where the Japanese tortured and massacred civilians in the barrios of Marao and Polo where the Hunter\u2019s guerillas built their camps.\n\n==Laguimanoc Festival==\n\nA festival celebrated on February 17 every year. This feast explains the history of the municipality. '''Laguimanoc''' was the former name of the municipality before it was renamed to Padre Burgos.\n\n==Popular culture==\nThis island was also set from the movie ''Alkitrang Dugo'' in 1975.\n\n==Notes==\n\n{{notelist}}\n\n==References==\n\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* [http://www.nscb.gov.ph/activestats/psgc/default.asp Philippine Standard Geographic Code]\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20131004104825/http://census.gov.ph/ Philippine Census Information]\n* [http://www.blgs.gov.ph/lgpmsv2/cmshome/index.php?pageID=23&frmIdDcfCode=7&fLguType=CM&frmIdRegion=6&frmIdProvince=37&frmIdLgu=728 Local Governance Performance Management System]\n\n{{Geographic location\n|Centre    = Padre Burgos\n|North     = [[Atimonan, Quezon|Atimonan]]\n|East      = [[Agdangan, Quezon|Agdangan]]\n|South     = ''[[Tayabas Bay]]''\n|West      = [[Pagbilao, Quezon|Pagbilao]]\n}}\n{{Quezon}}\n\n[[Category:Municipalities of Quezon]]\n", "text_old": "{{Infobox settlement\n| name                            = {{PH wikidata|name}}\n| image_skyline                   = \n| image_caption                   = \n| image_seal                      = Ph seal quezon padre burgos.png\n| seal_size                       = 100x80px\n| image_map                       = {{PH wikidata|image_map}}\n| map_caption                     = {{PH wikidata|map_caption}}\n| image_map1                      = {{Infobox mapframe|id={{#invoke:Wikibase|id}}}}\n| pushpin_map                     = Philippines\n| pushpin_label_position          = left\n| pushpin_map_caption             = Location within the {{PH wikidata|country}}\n| coordinates                     = {{PH wikidata|coordinates}}\n| settlement_type                 = {{PH wikidata|settlement_type}}\n| subdivision_type                = [[List of sovereign states|Country]]\n| subdivision_name                = {{flag|Philippines}}\n| subdivision_type1               = [[Regions of the Philippines|Region]]\n| subdivision_name1               = {{PH wikidata|region}}\n| subdivision_type2               = [[Provinces of the Philippines|Province]]\n| subdivision_name2               = {{PH wikidata|province}}\n| official_name                   = {{PH wikidata|official_name}}\n| etymology                       = <!--origin of name-->\n| named_for                       = [[Jos\u00e9 Burgos]]\n| native_name                     = \n| other_name                      = \n| nickname                        = \n| motto                           = \n| anthem                          = \n| subdivision_type3               = [[House of Representatives of the Philippines#District representation|District]]\n| subdivision_name3               = [[Legislative districts of Quezon#3rd District|3rd District]]\n| established_title               = Founded\n| established_date                = February 17, 1917\n| parts_type                      = [[Barangay]]s\n| parts                           = 22 (see [[#Barangays|Barangays]])\n| leader_title                    = {{PH wikidata|leader_title}} <!--mayor-->\n| leader_name                     = Ruben B.

All the population are of [[Tagalog people|Tagalog]] descent. The economy is primarily based on [[coconut]] husking and farming. Local tourism is also on the rise.\n\n==Barangays==\n\nPadre Burgos is administratively divided into 22 barangays.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|-\n! Barangay name\n!

Another version is that chickens were so abundant in the town that hawks swept down on the place to snatch chicks from their mothers. When hawks flew overhead, as warning to their neighborhood, people shouted \u201cHawk Manok\u201d or \u201cLawin-Manok\u201d.\n\nOn January 1, 1917 the village of Laguimanoc, which was formerly a barrio of Atimonan, became a municipality. Ten years after, the town\u2019s council changed the name to Padre Burgos, in honor of one of the country\u2019s martyrs, [[gomburza|Fr. Jose P. Burgos]]. The streets were named after local leaders who rendered valuable services to the community. Because of the physical and topographic conditions of the town, four sitios where clusters of houses were became the main district of the town namely Campo, Burgos, Basiao and Bundok-Punta. The community converged to be in this particular spot because of its sea which made this town as port of Laguimanoc. In the early days this port offered a good wharf for vessels plying between Manila and southern Luzon. This was also a port of call for ships exporting lumber to Europe during the Spanish regime. In this town was the residence of the \u201cAlcalde Mar\u201d or Port Officer.\n\nBusiness and other industries prospered and people conglomerated in this spot. Spots of the historical interest are the wharf symbol of commercial progress, the old church with the old-fashioned \u201ccanyon\u201d markers of the people\u2019s religious faith, the Bag Cement Slabs and Stone quarries mute testimonies of the effervescent power and grandeur of the early foreign settlers, the hills near the railroad station where the Japanese tortured and massacred civilians in the barrios of Marao and Polo where the Hunter\u2019s guerillas built their camps.\n\n==Laguimanoc Festival==\n\nA festival celebrated on February 17 every year. This feast explains the history of the municipality. '''Laguimanoc''' was the former name of the municipality before it was renamed to Padre Burgos.\n\n==Popular culture==\nThis island was also set from the movie ''Alkitrang Dugo'' in 1975.\n\n==Notes==\n\n{{notelist}}\n\n==References==\n\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* [http://www.nscb.gov.ph/activestats/psgc/default.asp Philippine Standard Geographic Code]\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20131004104825/http://census.gov.ph/ Philippine Census Information]\n* [http://www.blgs.gov.ph/lgpmsv2/cmshome/index.php?pageID=23&frmIdDcfCode=7&fLguType=CM&frmIdRegion=6&frmIdProvince=37&frmIdLgu=728 Local Governance Performance Management System]\n\n{{Geographic location\n|Centre    = Padre Burgos\n|North     = [[Atimonan, Quezon|Atimonan]]\n|East      = [[Agdangan, Quezon|Agdangan]]\n|South     = ''[[Tayabas Bay]]''\n|West      = [[Pagbilao, Quezon|Pagbilao]]\n}}\n{{Quezon}}\n\n[[Category:Municipalities of Quezon]]\n", "name_user": "Etagyam", "label": "unsafe", "comment": "(Edit official Website)", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Padre_Burgos,_Quezon"}
