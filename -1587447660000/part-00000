Eleven appears to have been born [[Psychokinesis|telekinetic]]. However, the use of her abilities temporarily weakens her and causes her [[nosebleeds|nose to bleed]]. At birth, Eleven was taken away from her mother by Dr. Martin Brenner and was raised in the National Laboratory in Hawkins, Indiana as a test subject to develop her [[Psychokinesis|psychokinetic]] skills. When placed in a [[isolation tank|sensory deprivation tank]] she can use [[Remote Viewing|remote viewing]] and access other [[parallel universes in fiction|dimension]]s, primarily for the purposes of international espionage. Eleven encounters a creature living in the Upside Down dimension, and on the evening of November 6, 1983, she finally makes contact with it. In efforts to make contact, Eleven opens a gate between the Hawkins Laboratory and the Upside Down dimension and the creature gains the ability to travel between the human world and the Upside Down.\n\nIn the first season, Eleven escapes from Hawkins Laboratory and attempts to steal food from a local restaurant. She and the owner bond, but the owner calls social services. The responding social worker, who turns out to be a Hawkins Laboratory agent, kills the owner. Eleven flees before being taken once again. She is then found by Mike Wheeler ([[Finn Wolfhard]]), Dustin Henderson ([[Gaten Matarazzo]]) and Lucas Sinclair ([[Caleb McLaughlin]]), who are looking for their missing friend, Will Byers ([[Noah Schnapp]]). The boys learn that her name is Eleven based on a \"011\" tattoo found on her left forearm. After learning this, Mike decides to call her \"El\" for short. Mike allows Eleven to live in his basement in a blanket fort. Fearing recapture, Eleven convinces Mike not to tell any adults so the social workers will not find her.\n\nEleven helps to locate Will using her supernatural abilities, and determines that he is trapped in the Upside Down. The group sets out to find Will using their compasses, but Eleven interferes with their search when she realizes that they are being led towards the laboratory. Lucas, noticing her deception, becomes angry at her (having mistrusted her from the beginning). She flees, steals boxes of frozen waffles from a store, and consumes them in a forest. Mike and Dustin are threatened by bullies where Mike is forced to jump off a high cliff into a river with Dustin being held hostage but Eleven returns, immediately intervenes before Mike hits the water and saves both Mike and Dustin.\n\nEleven, Mike, and Dustin reunite with Lucas and make amends. They travel to the town junkyard with Dr. Brenner and his associates in close pursuit. During the chase, Eleven uses her powers to cause a laboratory van to flip through the air. The group is aided by Joyce Byers ([[Winona Ryder]]), Police Chief [[Jim Hopper (character)|Jim Hopper]] ([[David Harbour]]), [[Nancy Wheeler (character)|Nancy Wheeler]] ([[Natalia Dyer]]), and Jonathan Byers ([[Charlie Heaton]]), produce a makeshift isolation tank with a pool and bags of salt. Eleven accesses the Upside Down and confirms that Will is alive. As laboratory personnel close in on the school, Mike tells Eleven she can be a part of his family and asks her to the school dance. He then kisses her after struggling to explain his feelings towards her. Eleven helps the group escape by using her powers to kill most of the agents, although doing so leaves her drained. The monster from the Upside Down makes its way into their dimension, and Eleven seemingly sacrifices herself to destroy the creature and save her friends.\n\nOne month later, after a [[Christmas]] party, Hopper leaves the police station and drives to the woods. There, he leaves waffles in a concealed box. The whereabouts or condition of Eleven are left ambiguous.<ref>{{cite news |last=Berkshire |first=Geoff |date=July 18, 2016 |title='Stranger Things' Finale: Duffer Brothers Talk Cliffhangers, Death and Season 2 |url=https://variety.com/2016/tv/news/stranger-things-finale-duffer-brothers-interview-season-2-1201816664/ |work=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]|access-date=October 16, 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |last=Stephens |first=Emily |date=July 29, 2016 |title=On Stranger Things' season finale, promises are made to be broken |url=http://www.avclub.com/tvclub/stranger-things-season-finale-promises-are-made-be-240275 |work=[[The A.V.

She escapes through a portal, leading her back to the school. With the government still searching for her, she is forced to hide in the forest. Eleven eventually finds the [[Eggos]] Hopper left for her and seeks him out. The two move into a cabin in the woods where he forbids her to leave, fearing for her safety. Hopper hides Eleven indoors for almost a year, telling no one of her whereabouts, not even Mike. During this time, Eleven gains better control over her powers; she is less weakened by the use of her telekinesis, and she is now able to project her mind without the use of a sensory deprivation tank. She uses the latter ability to listen to Mike's attempts to contact her, though she is increasingly frustrated at her inability to reply. Eleven also significantly expands her vocabulary during this time, learning from both Hopper and television.\n\nEleven becomes restless and longs to reunite with Mike, and this causes tension between her and Hopper. She runs away from home one day and travels to Hawkins Middle School. When she finds Mike, he is with Max, a new student. Eleven mistakenly thinks Max is flirting with Mike and, out of spite, uses her powers to knock her off of her skateboard before leaving. Upon returning to the cabin, she gets into a heated argument with Hopper over her leaving the cabin, ending with her using her powers to damage the cabin out of anger. The next day, cleaning the mess she made of the cabin, she discovers by looking through records in the cabin's basement her birth mother is alive, a contradiction to what Hopper had told her. She then goes to meet her birth mother, Terry, and her aunt, Becky, and discovers what happened to Terry at Hawkins Laboratory. While there, she realizes Terry is trying to talk with her, but due to her catatonic state, is unable to. Eleven, using her powers, views a flashback from her mother. Terry, after her daughter was taken from her, attempted to force her way into Hawkins Lab to save her. As a response, Brenner and his assistants captured her and subjected her to electroshock therapy, resulting in her current condition. Eleven then uses her abilities to find out she has a \"sister\"{{spaced endash}}another gifted girl taken by Dr. Brenner for experimentations{{spaced endash}}and sets out to find her.\n\nUsing her abilities once again, Eleven locates her sister and discovers that she is an older girl named Kali (\"Eight\"), with the ability to cause people to have visual hallucinations. Eleven stays with Kali and her friends{{spaced endash}}runaways who are determined to take revenge on people who have hurt them. Kali tells Eleven that while using her powers, she needs to think about what makes her most angry. When they go to get revenge on Brenner's assistant who helped hurt Eleven's mother, Eleven begins to choke him to death but stops upon realizing that he has two daughters. She then stops Kali from shooting him. Back at the hideout, Eleven witnesses Hopper and Mike in danger through the void. While the gang are about to flee, Eleven realizes she needs to go back to her friends because they need her help.\n\nEleven goes back to Hawkins and finally reunites with Mike with a heartfelt embrace and her friends after saving them from a Demodog. The group realizes that she needs to close the gate to the Upside Down, and she and Hopper head to Hawkins Laboratory. There, Eleven uses Kali's advice and focuses her anger into her powers, closing the gate and draining her powers. Afterward, it is discovered that Dr. Owens has forged a birth certificate allowing for Hopper to become her legal adoptive father as a way to help keep Eleven in hiding. Eleven's new legal name is Jane Hopper. Hopper lets her attend the Snow Ball at Hawkins Middle School. She meets up with Mike, dances with him, and they share their first kiss as a couple.\n\n===Season 3===\n{{see also|Stranger Things (season 3)}}\nAt the start of season three, Eleven and Mike have been dating for seven months, much to the dismay of Hopper, who is annoyed that El and Mike are constantly together, spending all of their time alone kissing. When Hopper confesses to Joyce that he feels uncomfortable about the situation, she asserts that he should sit down and calmly talk to El and Mike about how he feels. This backfires, however, and Hopper resorts to verbally threatening Mike to stay away from Eleven, or he will end their relationship. When Mike is forced to lie to Eleven about why he can no longer visit her, she becomes suspicious and seeks advice from Max, who asserts that Mike is pushing her aside to spend time playing games with the boys, and suggests that they have some fun of their own by going shopping at the new Starcourt mall. The girls spend quality time together, shopping, where they encounter Lucas, Will and Mike, who are attempting to buy Eleven a makeup present. When Mike lies and says the present is for his sick grandmother, Eleven angrily breaks up with him and leaves on a bus with Max, where the girls spend the night sleeping over at Hopper's house and use Eleven's telepathic powers to spy on the boys. This leads to a game they create in which they spin a bottle and spy on whoever it lands on. Eleven spies on Billy and it appears he has kidnapped someone, so the girls go to look for him and discover a fellow lifeguard has also gone missing. They discover that Billy has been taken over by the Mind Flayer. They reunite with Mike, Lucas, and Will. Mike is annoyed that El would spy on him and has an argument with Max about his feelings for Eleven while she is spying on the Flayed. She holds off the Mind Flayer when the cabin is attacked, but the Flayer wounds her and leaves a piece of itself in the wound. El and Mike make up, but the Flayer and Billy track them due to the wound. Eleven loses her powers, but the group defeat the Mind Flayer by closing the portal to the Upside Down. Hopper is presumed dead in the explosion that closes the gate and Eleven is taken in by the Byers. While the Byers are packing to leave Hawkins, El reveals to Mike that she loves him too and they share a kiss. Joyce gives her a letter written by Hopper that he intended to use when talking to her and Mike about how he felt about them dating. Eleven and the Byers then leave Hawkins.\n\n== Development ==\n\n=== Conception and writing ===\n[[The Duffer Brothers]] originally based the character of Eleven on survivors of the [[Project MKUltra]] experiments, with influences from ''[[E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial|E.T.]]'' and the idea of being an outsider.

Eleven appears to have been born [[Psychokinesis|telekinetic]]. However, the use of her abilities temporarily weakens her and causes her [[nosebleeds|nose to bleed]]. At birth, Eleven was taken away from her mother by Dr. Martin Brenner and was raised in the National Laboratory in Hawkins, Indiana as a test subject to develop her [[Psychokinesis|psychokinetic]] skills. When placed in a [[isolation tank|sensory deprivation tank]] she can use [[Remote Viewing|remote viewing]] and access other [[parallel universes in fiction|dimension]]s, primarily for the purposes of international espionage. Eleven encounters a creature living in the Upside Down dimension, and on the evening of November 6, 1983, she finally makes contact with it. In efforts to make contact, Eleven opens a gate between the Hawkins Laboratory and the Upside Down dimension and the creature gains the ability to travel between the human world and the Upside Down.\n\nIn the first season, Eleven escapes from Hawkins Laboratory and attempts to steal food from a local restaurant. She and the owner bond, but the owner calls social services. The responding social worker, who turns out to be a Hawkins Laboratory agent, kills the owner. Eleven flees before being taken once again. She is then found by Mike Wheeler ([[Finn Wolfhard]]), Dustin Henderson ([[Gaten Matarazzo]]) and Lucas Sinclair ([[Caleb McLaughlin]]), who are looking for their missing friend, Will Byers ([[Noah Schnapp]]). The boys learn that her name is Eleven based on a \"011\" tattoo found on her left forearm. After learning this, Mike decides to call her \"El\" for short. Mike allows Eleven to live in his basement in a blanket fort. Fearing recapture, Eleven convinces Mike not to tell any adults so the social workers will not find her.\n\nEleven helps to locate Will using her supernatural abilities, and determines that he is trapped in the Upside Down. The group sets out to find Will using their compasses, but Eleven interferes with their search when she realizes that they are being led towards the laboratory. Lucas, noticing her deception, becomes angry at her (having mistrusted her from the beginning). She flees, steals boxes of frozen waffles from a store, and consumes them in a forest. Mike and Dustin are threatened by bullies where Mike is forced to jump off a high cliff into a river with Dustin being held hostage but Eleven returns, immediately intervenes before Mike hits the water and saves both Mike and Dustin.\n\nEleven, Mike, and Dustin reunite with Lucas and make amends. They travel to the town junkyard with Dr. Brenner and his associates in close pursuit. During the chase, Eleven uses her powers to cause a laboratory van to flip through the air. The group is aided by Joyce Byers ([[Winona Ryder]]), Police Chief [[Jim Hopper (character)|Jim Hopper]] ([[David Harbour]]), [[Nancy Wheeler (character)|Nancy Wheeler]] ([[Natalia Dyer]]), and Jonathan Byers ([[Charlie Heaton]]), produce a makeshift isolation tank with a pool and bags of salt. Eleven accesses the Upside Down and confirms that Will is alive. As laboratory personnel close in on the school, Mike tells Eleven she can be a part of his family and asks her to the school dance. He then kisses her after struggling to explain his feelings towards her. Eleven helps the group escape by using her powers to kill most of the agents, although doing so leaves her drained. The monster from the Upside Down makes its way into their dimension, and Eleven seemingly sacrifices herself to destroy the creature and save her friends.\n\nOne month later, after a [[Christmas]] party, Hopper leaves the police station and drives to the woods. There, he leaves waffles in a concealed box. The whereabouts or condition of Eleven are left ambiguous.<ref>{{cite news |last=Berkshire |first=Geoff |date=July 18, 2016 |title='Stranger Things' Finale: Duffer Brothers Talk Cliffhangers, Death and Season 2 |url=https://variety.com/2016/tv/news/stranger-things-finale-duffer-brothers-interview-season-2-1201816664/ |work=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]|access-date=October 16, 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |last=Stephens |first=Emily |date=July 29, 2016 |title=On Stranger Things' season finale, promises are made to be broken |url=http://www.avclub.com/tvclub/stranger-things-season-finale-promises-are-made-be-240275 |work=[[The A.V.

She escapes through a portal, leading her back to the school. With the government still searching for her, she is forced to hide in the forest. Eleven eventually finds the [[Eggos]] Hopper left for her and seeks him out. The two move into a cabin in the woods where he forbids her to leave, fearing for her safety. Hopper hides Eleven indoors for almost a year, telling no one of her whereabouts, not even Mike. During this time, Eleven gains better control over her powers; she is less weakened by the use of her telekinesis, and she is now able to project her mind without the use of a sensory deprivation tank. She uses the latter ability to listen to Mike's attempts to contact her, though she is increasingly frustrated at her inability to reply. Eleven also significantly expands her vocabulary during this time, learning from both Hopper and television.\n\nEleven becomes restless and longs to reunite with Mike, and this causes tension between her and Hopper. She runs away from home one day and travels to Hawkins Middle School. When she finds Mike, he is with Max, a new student. Eleven mistakenly thinks Max is flirting with Mike and, out of spite, uses her powers to knock her off of her skateboard before leaving.

A room in his medical institution (numbered 404) is rumoured to be haunted by the ghost of a student named Gaurav, who previously stayed in that room and had committed suicide there, which he surely doesn\u2019t believe. A rational student Abhimanyu (Rajvvir Aroraa) now occupies that room. The seniors rag him and tell him to collect all the information about Gaurav. One day the ragging increases so much that he starts seeing visions of Gaurav. He visits Gaurav's house and brings over his stuff. He goes to Prof. Anirudh and discusses it with him to which he replies that it's just an illusion. His wife, Dr Mira, who's also a Professor at the same institute, suggests him to change his room to which Prof. Anirudh refuses and tells him to stop thinking about Gaurav. Abhimanyu starts hallucinating about Gaurav to an extent that he starts talking to him. Prof. Anirudh interviews Abhimanyu about his experience with Gaurav and how it all started. Prof. Anirudh tells Abhimanyu that ghosts don't exist to which Abimanyu disagrees and tells him that Gaurav really exists. It is later discovered that Prof. Anirudh was using him for his thesis and told the seniors to rag him. Abhimanyu finds about it and feels betrayed. Prof. Anirudh later comes to Abhimanyu and tells him about how he was doing it for a good cause. Abhimanyu tells Prof. Anirudh that he can still prove him wrong and invites him to his room and there it is seen that Abhimanyu's body is hanging from the fan and that Prof. Anirudh, himself, was talking to Abhimanyu's ghost.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.indianexpress.com/news/404-It-s-all-in-the-mind/766829/|title=404-It\u2019s all in the mind|newspaper=Indian Express|accessdate=2011-08-03}}</ref>\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Imaad Shah]] as Chris\n* [[Nishikant Kamath]] as Professor Anirudh\n* [[Ruchir Raj]] in and as Gaurav\n* [[Ritika Silas]] in and as Tara\n* [[Rajvvir Aroraa]] as Abhimanyu\n* [[Satish Kaushik]] as Professor Vaidya\n* [[Tisca Chopra]] as Dr Mira\n* [[Sara Arjun|Baby Sarah]]\n* [[Prabhat Raghunandan]] as Mustafa\n* [[Meenakshi Thapa]]\n* [[Vishal Pal]]\n\n==Reception==\nThe film was generally well received by critics.

Her assistant Whitney (Betty Gilpin), a fan of rom-coms, believes their co-worker Josh (Adam DeVine) to be in love with Natalie, but Natalie dismisses the notion because Josh appears to spend all his time staring at the model (Pryanka Chopra) on a billboard across the street. \n\nOne day, Natalie (Rebel Wilson) is knocked unconscious during an attempted mugging on a subway platform and finds herself trapped in the world of stereotypical romantic comedies that she despises. In this world, Whitney is her enemy, and her uninterested neighbor Donny (Brandon Scott Jones) is a flamboyant gay friend offering advice, while Blake (Liam Hemsworth), a billionaire client of her company who previously paid her no attention, develops a romantic interest in her. Additionally, Josh enters into a relationship with the billboard model, who identifies herself as a \"yoga ambassador\" named Isabella.\n\nDesperate to return to her reality, Natalie deduces that in the tradition of romantic comedies, she can only leave by finding true love. When her relationship with Blake turns sour, Natalie recognizes that she has feelings for Josh, who has become engaged to Isabella. Natalie attempts to stop their wedding, but soon realizes that instead of loving another person, she needs to learn to love herself. Following this revelation, Natalie winds up in a car accident and loses consciousness.\n\nNatalie wakes up back in the real world, but with new self-confidence, which she uses to successfully propose an idea to Blake. After reuniting with Josh, she learns that he has not been staring at the model, but at Natalie's reflection, and the two begin a relationship. As Natalie prepares to head home, Whitney tells her that despite her dislike for romantic comedies, everything she just experienced has been comparable to one. Natalie realizes that she has actually been in a romantic comedy in the real world the entire time. \n\nUltimately, Natalie and everyone else engage in a rendition of \"[[Express Yourself (Madonna song)|Express Yourself]]\" at the intersection of [[Park Avenue]] and East 40th Street in New York City.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Rebel Wilson]] as Natalie, an Australian architect living in New York.<ref name=\"May2016V\" />\n** Alex Kis as 12-year-old Natalie\n* [[Liam Hemsworth]] as Blake, a billionaire client of Natalie's company and potential love interest in the fantasy world.<ref name=\"May2017THR\" />\n* [[Adam DeVine]] as Josh, Natalie's best friend and co-worker.<ref name=\"May2017THR\" />\n* [[Priyanka Chopra]] as Isabella, a billboard model who appears as a yoga ambassador in the fantasy world.<ref name=\"ChopraCast\" />\n* [[Betty Gilpin]] as Whitney, Natalie's assistant and friend who becomes her nemesis in fantasy world.<ref name=\"GilpinCast\" />\n* Brandon Scott Jones as Donny, Natalie's neighbor, depicted as a flamboyant gay friend in the fantasy world.\n* [[Jennifer Saunders]] as Natalie's mother\n* [[Big Jay Oakerson]] as Gary\n* [[Tom Ellis (actor)|Tom Ellis]] as Dr. Todd, the doctor in the fantasy world.\n* [[Michelle Buteau]] as Martina\n*[[Bowen Yang]] as Donny\u2019s Guy\n*[[Eugenia Kuzmina]] as Eugenia\n\n==Production==\nOn May 23, 2016, it was reported that [[Rebel Wilson]] would star as Natalie in an untitled romantic comedy film by [[New Line Cinema]], from an original script by [[Erin Cardillo]] and rewrite by [[Dana Fox]] and [[Katie Silberman]], while producers would be [[Todd Garner]], Grant Scharbo, and Gina Matthews.<ref name=\"May2016V\">{{cite news|last1=McNary|first1=Dave|title=Rebel Wilson to Star in Romantic Comedy for New Line (EXCLUSIVE)|url=https://variety.com/2016/film/news/rebel-wilson-romantic-comedy-new-line-1201781569/|accessdate=July 11, 2017|work=Variety|date=May 23, 2016}}</ref> On March 22, 2017, [[Todd Strauss-Schulson]] was hired to direct the film, titled ''Isn't It Romantic.''

Her assistant Whitney, a fan of romantic comedies, believes their co-worker Josh is in love with Natalie, but Natalie dismisses the notion because Josh appears to spend all his time staring at the model on a billboard across the street. One day, Natalie is knocked unconscious during an attempted mugging on a subway platform and finds herself trapped in the world of stereotypical romantic comedies that she despises. In this world, Whitney is her enemy, and her uninterested neighbor Donny is a flamboyant gay friend offering advice, while Blake, a billionaire client of her company who previously paid her no attention, develops a romantic interest in her. Additionally, Josh enters into a relationship with the billboard model, who identifies herself as a \"yoga ambassador\" named Isabella.\n\nDesperate to return to her reality, Natalie deduces that in the tradition of romantic comedies, she can only leave by finding true love. When her relationship with Blake turns sour, Natalie recognizes that she has feelings for Josh, who has become engaged to Isabella. Natalie attempts to stop their wedding, but soon realizes that instead of loving another person, she needs to learn to love herself. Following this revelation, Natalie winds up in a car accident and loses consciousness.\n\nNatalie wakes up back in the real world, but with new self-confidence, which she uses to successfully propose an idea to Blake. After reuniting with Josh, she learns that he has not been staring at the model, but at Natalie's reflection, and the two begin a relationship. As Natalie prepares to head home, Whitney tells her that despite her dislike for romantic comedies, everything she just experienced has been comparable to one. Natalie realizes that she has actually been in a romantic comedy in the real world the entire time. \n\nUltimately, Natalie and everyone else engage in a rendition of \"[[Express Yourself (Madonna song)|Express Yourself]]\" at the intersection of [[Park Avenue]] and East 40th Street in New York City.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Rebel Wilson]] as Natalie, an Australian architect living in New York.<ref name=\"May2016V\" />\n** Alex Kis as 12-year-old Natalie\n* [[Liam Hemsworth]] as Blake, a billionaire client of Natalie's company and potential love interest in the fantasy world.<ref name=\"May2017THR\" />\n* [[Adam DeVine]] as Josh, Natalie's best friend and co-worker.<ref name=\"May2017THR\" />\n* [[Priyanka Chopra]] as Isabella, a billboard model who appears as a yoga ambassador in the fantasy world.<ref name=\"ChopraCast\" />\n* [[Betty Gilpin]] as Whitney, Natalie's assistant and friend who becomes her nemesis in fantasy world.<ref name=\"GilpinCast\" />\n* Brandon Scott Jones as Donny, Natalie's neighbor, depicted as a flamboyant gay friend in the fantasy world.\n* [[Jennifer Saunders]] as Natalie's mother\n* [[Big Jay Oakerson]] as Gary\n* [[Tom Ellis (actor)|Tom Ellis]] as Dr. Todd, the doctor in the fantasy world.\n* [[Michelle Buteau]] as Martina\n*[[Bowen Yang]] as Donny\u2019s Guy\n*[[Eugenia Kuzmina]] as Eugenia\n\n==Production==\nOn May 23, 2016, it was reported that [[Rebel Wilson]] would star as Natalie in an untitled romantic comedy film by [[New Line Cinema]], from an original script by [[Erin Cardillo]] and rewrite by [[Dana Fox]] and [[Katie Silberman]], while producers would be [[Todd Garner]], Grant Scharbo, and Gina Matthews.<ref name=\"May2016V\">{{cite news|last1=McNary|first1=Dave|title=Rebel Wilson to Star in Romantic Comedy for New Line (EXCLUSIVE)|url=https://variety.com/2016/film/news/rebel-wilson-romantic-comedy-new-line-1201781569/|accessdate=July 11, 2017|work=Variety|date=May 23, 2016}}</ref> On March 22, 2017, [[Todd Strauss-Schulson]] was hired to direct the film, titled ''Isn't It Romantic.''
