They are named for the [[Borough of Halton]]. They were formed in 2014, and play in the [[BAFANL]] Division 1 NFC South.Their current general manager is Ian Derbyshire.\n\n==History==\nInitially named the '''[[Runcorn|Runcorn Spartans]]''', they were formed in early 2014. After contacting former members of the Halton Demons, a team that existed from the late 1980s to early 1990s,<ref>[http://www.britballnow.co.uk/History/Britball%20Teams/HALTONDEMONS.htm Britball Now - Halton Demons]</ref> the first training sessions were organised in the local Heath Park.\n\nThe organisation changed their name to their current guise, the Halton Spartans to better represent their recruitment area. They were also more likely to play in nearby Widnes than Runcorn.<ref>[http://www.haltonspartans.com/#!maintenance/c66t Halton Spartans - History]</ref>\n\nThey completed their schedule of associate games, first defeating the [[Liverpool John Moores University|LJMU Fury]], and defeating fellow associate teams the [[Tynedale Fury]] and the [[Humber Warhawks]] in their first game at the [[Select Security Stadium]]. In December 2014, they were admitted into the BAFANL for the 2015 season and were placed in Division Two NFC West.\n\nAhead of the 2015 season, Double Coverage, a site that covers American Football in Britain made their annual predictions. Only one writer, Richard Penwright, predicted that the Spartans would win their division.<ref>[http://dblcoverage.com/dc-writers-preseason-picks-bafa-national-leagues/3/ DC Writers Pre-Season Picks]</ref> This kick-started the \"#InRichWeTrust\" campaign on Twitter and Facebook.<ref>[http://dblcoverage.com/what-we-learned-national-leagues-week-2/ Double Coverage - What We Learned: National Leagues Week 2]</ref> They won their first competitive game, away to the [[Crewe Railroaders]], 24-15.<ref>[http://www.crewechronicle.co.uk/sport/other-sport/crewe-railroaders-slip-opening-day-9051524 Crewe Railroaders slip to opening day defeat]</ref> The Spartans went on to complete their first season within the BAFANL with a 5-5 record. It was also noted how well managed the Spartans were for a young britball programme, most obviously for their ability to be able to draw a sizeable crowd for an amateur sport, with numbers varying from 300-600 at their peak.<ref>[https://www.footballamerica.co.uk/blog/drawing-a-crowd-with-the-halton-spartans-10.html]</ref>\n\nThe 2016 season again saw the Spartans utilise the select security stadium as their home ground. Defeating every team in their division at least once, barring the Leeds Bobcats. The Spartans were able to clinch their first winning season since joining the BAFANL the year prior. The Spartans finished a respectable 6-4, narrowly missing out on playoffs in only their second competitive season.\n\nBefore the start of the 2017 season, offence coordinator Chris Henry left the Spartans due to work commitments outside of football. Thus Halton recruited Jason Smith to take over, then head coach of Staffordshire Surge.<ref>[http://dblcoverage.com/halton-spartans-announce-coaching-staff-for-britball17]</ref> The Spartans endured a disappointing campaign in their third season which ultimately left them with their first ever losing record finishing 4-6.

They are named for the [[Borough of Halton]]. They were formed in 2014, and play in the [[BAFANL]] Division 1 NFC South.Their current general manager is Ian Derbyshire.\n\n==History==\nInitially named the '''[[Runcorn|Runcorn Spartans]]''', they were formed in early 2014. After contacting former members of the Halton Demons, a team that existed from the late 1980s to early 1990's,<ref>[http://www.britballnow.co.uk/History/Britball%20Teams/HALTONDEMONS.htm Britball Now - Halton Demons]</ref> the first training sessions were organised in the local Heath Park.\n\nThe organisation changed their name to their current guise, the Halton Spartans to better represent their recruitment area. They were also more likely to play in nearby Widnes than Runcorn.<ref>[http://www.haltonspartans.com/#!maintenance/c66t Halton Spartans - History]</ref>\n\nThey completed their schedule of associate games, first defeating the [[Liverpool John Moores University|LJMU Fury]], and defeating fellow associate teams the [[Tynedale Fury]] and the [[Humber Warhawks]] in their first game at the [[Select Security Stadium]]. In December 2014, they were admitted into the BAFANL for the 2015 season and were placed in Division Two NFC West.\n\nAhead of the 2015 season, Double Coverage, a site that covers American Football in Britain made their annual predictions. Only one writer, Richard Penwright, predicted that the Spartans would win their division.<ref>[http://dblcoverage.com/dc-writers-preseason-picks-bafa-national-leagues/3/ DC Writers Pre-Season Picks]</ref> This kick-started the \"#InRichWeTrust\" campaign on Twitter and Facebook.<ref>[http://dblcoverage.com/what-we-learned-national-leagues-week-2/ Double Coverage - What We Learned: National Leagues Week 2]</ref> They won their first competitive game, away to the [[Crewe Railroaders]], 24-15.<ref>[http://www.crewechronicle.co.uk/sport/other-sport/crewe-railroaders-slip-opening-day-9051524 Crewe Railroaders slip to opening day defeat]</ref> The Spartans went on to complete their first season within the BAFANL with a 5-5 record. It was also noted how well managed the Spartans were for a young britball programme, most obviously for their ability to be able to draw a sizeable crowd for an amateur sport, with numbers varying from 300-600 at their peak.<ref>[https://www.footballamerica.co.uk/blog/drawing-a-crowd-with-the-halton-spartans-10.html]</ref>\n\nThe 2016 season again saw the Spartans utilise the select security stadium as their home ground. Defeating every team in their division at least once, barring the Leeds Bobcats. The Spartans were able to clinch their first winning season since joining the BAFANL the year prior. The Spartans finished a respectable 6-4, narrowly missing out on playoffs in only their second competitive season.\n\nBefore the start of the 2017 season, offence coordinator Chris Henry left the Spartans due to work commitments outside of football. Thus Halton recruited Jason Smith to take over, then head coach of Staffordshire Surge.<ref>[http://dblcoverage.com/halton-spartans-announce-coaching-staff-for-britball17]</ref> The Spartans endured a disappointing campaign in their third season which ultimately left them with their first ever losing record finishing 4-6.

{"title_page": "Treadwheel crane", "text_new": "[[File:Treadmillcrane.jpg|thumb|A 13th century drawing of a treadwheel crane]]\nA '''treadwheel crane''' ([[Latin]]: ''magna rota'') is a [[wood|wooden]], [[animal engine|human powered]], [[Crane (machine)|hoisting and lowering device]]. It was primarily used during the [[Roman Empire|Roman]] period and the [[Middle Ages]] in the building of [[castle]]s and [[cathedral]]s. The often heavy charge is lifted as the individual inside the [[treadwheel]] crane walks. The [[rope]] attached to a [[pulley]] is turned onto a [[Spindle (textiles)|spindle]] by the rotation of the [[wheel]] thus allowing the device to hoist or lower the affixed [[pallet]].\n\n== History ==\n=== Ancient Rome ===\n[[File:KranIBN.JPG|thumb|Reconstruction of a Roman treadwheel crane, the ''Polyspaston'', at [[Bonn]], Germany]]\nThe Roman ''Polyspaston'' crane, when worked by four men at both sides of the [[winch]], could lift 3000&nbsp;[[kg]]. In case the winch was replaced by a treadwheel, the maximum load even doubled to 6000&nbsp;kg at only half the crew, since the treadwheel possesses a much bigger [[mechanical advantage]] due to its larger [[diameter]]. This meant that, in comparison to the construction of the ancient [[Egyptian pyramids]], where about 50 men were needed to move a 2.5 ton stone block up the ramp (50&nbsp;kg per person), the lifting capability of the Roman ''Polyspaston'' proved to be ''60 times'' more efficient (3000&nbsp;kg per person).<ref>{{harvnb|Dienel|Meigh\u00f6rner|1997|p=13}}</ref> There are two surviving reliefs of Roman treadwheel cranes, the [[Quintus Haterius|Haterii]] [[tombstone]] from the late first century [[AD]] being particularly detailed.\n\nFor larger weights of up to 100 t, Roman engineers set up a wooden lifting tower, a rectangular [[trestle]] which was so constructed that the column could be lifted upright in the middle of the structure by the means of human and animal-powered [[Capstan (nautical)|capstans]] placed on the ground around the tower.<ref>{{harvnb|Lancaster|1999|pp=426\u2212432}}</ref>\n\n=== Middle Ages ===\n[[File:Tretkran (Bruegel).jpg|thumb|Pieter Bruegel's construction of ''[[The Tower of Babel (Bruegel)]]'' featuring a double treadwheel crane]]\n\nDuring the [[High Middle Ages]], the treadwheel crane was reintroduced on a large scale after the technology had fallen into disuse in [[western Europe]] with the demise of the [[Western Roman Empire]].<ref>{{harvnb|Matthies|1992|p=514}}</ref> The earliest reference to a treadwheel (''magna rota'') reappears in archival literature in [[France]] about 1225,<ref name=\"Andrea Matthies, p.515\">{{harvnb|Matthies|1992|p=515}}</ref> followed by an illuminated depiction in a [[manuscript]] of probably also French origin dating to 1240.<ref>{{harvnb|Matthies|1992|p=526}}</ref> In [[navigation]], the earliest uses of harbor cranes are documented for [[Utrecht (city)|Utrecht]] in 1244, [[Antwerp]] in 1263, [[Brugge]] in 1288 and [[Hamburg]] in 1291,<ref name=\"Matheus 1996, 345\">{{harvnb|Matheus|1996|p=345}}</ref> while in [[England]] the treadwheel is not recorded before 1331.<ref name=\"Matthies 1992, 524\">{{harvnb|Matthies|1992|p=524}}</ref>\n\nGenerally, vertical transport could be done more safely and inexpensively by cranes than by customary methods. Typical areas of application were [[harbour]]s, [[Mining|mines]], and, in particular, building sites where the treadwheel crane played a pivotal role in the construction of the lofty [[Gothic architecture|Gothic cathedrals]]. Nevertheless, both archival and pictorial sources of the time suggest that newly introduced machines like treadwheels or [[wheelbarrow]]s did not completely replace more labor-intensive methods like [[ladder]]s, [[Brick hod|hods]] and handbarrows. Rather, old and new machinery continued to coexist on medieval construction sites<ref>{{harvnb|Matthies|1992|p=545}}</ref> and harbours.<ref name=\"Matheus 1996, 345\"/>\n\nApart from treadwheels, medieval depictions also show cranes to be powered manually by [[windlass]]es with radiating [[spoke]]s, [[Crank (mechanism)|cranks]] and by the 15th century also by windlasses shaped like a [[ship's wheel]]. To smooth out irregularities of [[impulse]] and get over 'dead-spots' in the lifting process [[flywheel]]s are known to be in use as early as 1123.<ref>{{harvnb|Matthies|1992|p=518}}</ref>\n\nThe exact process by which the treadwheel crane was reintroduced is not recorded,<ref name=\"Andrea Matthies, p.515\"/> although its return to construction sites has undoubtedly to be viewed in close connection with the simultaneous rise of [[Gothic architecture]]. The reappearance of the treadwheel crane may have resulted from a technological development of the [[windlass]] from which the treadwheel structurally and mechanically evolved. Alternatively, the [[medieval]] treadwheel may represent a deliberate reinvention of its Roman counterpart drawn from [[Vitruvius]]' ''[[De architectura]]'' which was available in many [[monastery|monastic libraries]]. Its reintroduction may have been inspired, as well, by the observation of the labor-saving qualities of the [[Water wheel|waterwheel]] with which early treadwheels shared many structural similarities.<ref name=\"Matthies 1992, 524\"/>\n\n==== Structure and placement ====\n[[File:Reconstruction of the temple of Jerusalem.jpg|thumb|Single treadwheel crane working from top of the building]]\n\nThe medieval treadwheel was a large wooden wheel turning around a [[Axle|central shaft]] with a treadway wide enough for two workers walking side by side. While the earlier 'compass-arm' wheel had spokes directly driven into the central shaft, the more advanced 'clasp-arm' type featured arms arranged as chords to the wheel rim,<ref>{{harvnb|Matthies|1992|pp=525f.}}</ref> giving the possibility of using a thinner shaft and providing thus a greater mechanical advantage.<ref>{{harvnb|Matthies|1992|p=536}}</ref>\n\nContrary to a popularly held belief, cranes on medieval building sites were neither placed on the extremely lightweight [[scaffolding]] used at the time nor on the thin walls of the Gothic churches which were incapable of supporting the weight of both hoisting machine and load. Rather, cranes were placed in the initial stages of construction on the ground, often within the building. When a new floor was completed, and massive tie beams of the roof connected the walls, the crane was dismantled and reassembled on the roof beams from where it was moved from bay to bay during construction of the vaults.<ref name=\"Matthies 1992, 533\">{{harvnb|Matthies|1992|p=533}}</ref> Thus, the crane \u2018grew\u2019 and \u2018wandered\u2019 with the building with the result that today all extant construction cranes in England are found in church towers above the vaulting and below the roof, where they remained after building construction for bringing material for repairs aloft.<ref>{{harvnb|Matthies|1992|pp=532ff.}}</ref>\n\nLess frequently, medieval illuminations also show cranes mounted on the outside of walls with the stand of the machine secured to putlogs.<ref>{{harvnb|Matthies|1992|p=535}}</ref>\n\n==== Mechanics and operation ====\n[[File:Medieval crane - Brugge.jpg|thumb|Reconstructed gantry crane of [[Brugge]] operated by two lateral treadwheels]]\n\nIn contrast to modern cranes, medieval cranes and hoists - much like their counterparts in Greece and Rome<ref name=\"Coulton 1974, 6\" >{{harvnb|Coulton|1974|p=6}}</ref> - were primarily capable of a vertical lift, and not used to move loads for a considerable distance horizontally as well.<ref name=\"Matthies 1992, 533\"/> Accordingly, lifting work was organized at the workplace in a different way than today. In building construction, for example, it is assumed that the crane lifted the stone blocks either from the bottom directly into place,<ref name=\"Matthies 1992, 533\"/> or from a place opposite the centre of the wall from where it could deliver the blocks for two teams working at each end of the wall.<ref name=\"Coulton 1974, 6\"/> Additionally, the crane master who usually gave orders at the treadwheel workers from outside the crane was able to manipulate the movement laterally by a small rope attached to the load.<ref name=\"Dienel, Meigh\u00f6rner 1997, 17\">{{harvnb|Dienel|Meigh\u00f6rner|1997|p=17}}</ref> Slewing cranes which allowed a rotation of the load and were thus particularly suited for dockside work appeared as early as 1340.<ref>{{harvnb|Matthies|1992|p=534}}</ref> While ashlar blocks were directly lifted by sling, lewis or devil's clamp (German ''Teufelskralle''), other objects were placed before in containers like [[pallet]]s, [[basket]]s, wooden boxes or [[barrel]]s.<ref>{{harvnb|Matthies|1992|p=531}}</ref>\n\nIt is noteworthy that medieval cranes rarely featured [[Ratchet (device)|ratchets]] or [[brake]]s to forestall the load from running backward.<ref>{{harvnb|Matthies|1992|p=540}}</ref> This curious absence is explained by the high [[Friction|friction force]] exercised by medieval treadwheels which normally prevented the wheel from accelerating beyond control.<ref name=\"Dienel, Meigh\u00f6rner 1997, 17\"/>\n\n==== Harbour usage ====\n[[File:Trier Germany Alter Krahnen.jpg|thumb|left|Tower crane at the inland harbour of [[Trier]] from 1413]]\n\nAccording to the \"present state of knowledge\" unknown in antiquity, stationary harbour cranes are considered a new development of the Middle Ages.<ref name=\"Matheus 1996, 345\"/> The typical harbour crane was a pivoting structure equipped with double treadwheels. These cranes were placed docksides for the loading and unloading of cargo where they replaced or complemented older lifting methods like [[see-saw]]s, [[winch]]es and [[Yard (sailing)|yards]].<ref name=\"Matheus 1996, 345\"/>\n\nTwo different types of harbour cranes can be identified with a varying geographical distribution: While gantry cranes which pivoted on a central vertical axle were commonly found at the Flemish and Dutch coastside, German sea and inland harbours typically featured tower cranes where the windlass and treadwheels were situated in a solid tower with only jib arm and roof rotating.<ref name=\"Matheus 1996, 346\">{{harvnb|Matheus|1996|p=346}}</ref> Dockside cranes were not adopted in the Mediterranean region and the highly developed Italian ports where authorities continued to rely on the more labor-intensive method of unloading goods by ramps beyond the Middle Ages.<ref>{{harvnb|Matheus|1996|p=347}}</ref>\n\nUnlike construction cranes where the work speed was determined by the relatively slow progress of the masons, harbour cranes usually featured double treadwheels to speed up loading. The two treadwheels whose diameter is estimated to be 4&nbsp;m or larger were attached to each side of the axle and rotated together.<ref name=\"Matheus 1996, 345\"/> Their capacity was 2\u20133 tons which apparently corresponded to the customary size of marine cargo.<ref name=\"Matheus 1996, 345\"/> Today, according to one survey, fifteen treadwheel harbour cranes from pre-industrial times are still extant throughout Europe.<ref>These are Bergen, Stockholm, Karlskrona (Sweden), Kopenhagen (Denmark), Harwich (England), Gda\u0144sk (Poland), L\u00fcneburg, Stade, Otterndorf, Marktbreit, W\u00fcrzburg, \u00d6strich, Bingen, Andernach and Trier (Germany). Cf. {{harvnb|Matheus|1996|p=346}}</ref> Some harbour cranes were specialised at mounting masts to newly built sailing ships, such as in [[Danzig]], [[Cologne]] and [[Bremen]].<ref name=\"Matheus 1996, 346\"/> Beside these stationary cranes, [[crane vessel|floating cranes]] which could be flexibly deployed in the whole port basin came into use by the 14th century.<ref name=\"Matheus 1996, 346\"/>\n\n== Surviving examples ==\n{{Further|List of historical harbour cranes}}\n\n=== Original ===\nA treadwheel crane survives at [[Chesterfield]], [[Derbyshire]] and is housed in the Museum. It has been dated to the early 14th century and was housed in the top of the church tower until its removal in 1947. It was reconstructed in the Museum for its opening in 1994.\n\nA treadwheel crane survives at [[Guildford]], [[Surrey]], [[United Kingdom]]. It dates from the late 17th or early 18th century and formerly stood in Friary Street. It was moved in 1970, having last been used ''ca.'' 1960 to move materials for [[Guildford Cathedral]]. It is a [[Scheduled monument|Scheduled Ancient Monument]] and a [[Listed building|Grade II* listed building]].<ref name=Guildford>{{NHLE|num=1377866 |desc=THE TREADWHEEL CRANE, MILLBROOK (west side), GUILDFORD, GUILDFORD, SURREY |accessdate=28 October 2009}}</ref>\n\nA treadwheel crane survives at [[Harwich]], [[Essex]], United Kingdom.

It was primarily used during the [[Roman Empire|Roman]] period and the [[Middle Ages]] in the building of [[castle]]s and [[cathedral]]s. The often heavy charge is lifted as the individual inside the [[treadwheel]] crane walks. The [[rope]] attached to a [[pulley]] is turned onto a [[Spindle (textiles)|spindle]] by the rotation of the [[wheel]] thus allowing the device to hoist or lower the affixed [[pallet]].\n\n== History ==\n=== Ancient Rome ===\n[[File:KranIBN.JPG|thumb|Reconstruction of a Roman treadwheel crane, the ''Polyspaston'', at [[Bonn]], Germany]]\nThe Roman ''Polyspaston'' crane, when worked by four men at both sides of the [[winch]], could lift 3000&nbsp;[[kg]]. In case the winch was replaced by a treadwheel, the maximum load even doubled to 6000&nbsp;kg at only half the crew, since the treadwheel possesses a much bigger [[mechanical advantage]] due to its larger [[diameter]]. This meant that, in comparison to the construction of the ancient [[Egyptian pyramids]], where about 50 men were needed to move a 2.5 ton stone block up the ramp (50&nbsp;kg per person), the lifting capability of the Roman ''Polyspaston'' proved to be ''60 times'' more efficient (3000&nbsp;kg per person).<ref>{{harvnb|Dienel|Meigh\u00f6rner|1997|p=13}}</ref> There are two surviving reliefs of Roman treadwheel cranes, the [[Quintus Haterius|Haterii]] [[tombstone]] from the late first century [[AD]] being particularly detailed.\n\nFor larger weights of up to 100 t, Roman engineers set up a wooden lifting tower, a rectangular [[trestle]] which was so constructed that the column could be lifted upright in the middle of the structure by the means of human and animal-powered [[Capstan (nautical)|capstans]] placed on the ground around the tower.<ref>{{harvnb|Lancaster|1999|pp=426\u2212432}}</ref>\n\n=== Middle Ages ===\n[[File:Tretkran (Bruegel).jpg|thumb|Pieter Bruegel's construction of ''[[The Tower of Babel (Bruegel)]]'' featuring a double treadwheel crane]]\n\nDuring the [[High Middle Ages]], the treadwheel crane was reintroduced on a large scale after the technology had fallen into disuse in [[western Europe]] with the demise of the [[Western Roman Empire]].<ref>{{harvnb|Matthies|1992|p=514}}</ref> The earliest reference to a treadwheel (''magna rota'') reappears in archival literature in [[France]] about 1225,<ref name=\"Andrea Matthies, p.515\">{{harvnb|Matthies|1992|p=515}}</ref> followed by an illuminated depiction in a [[manuscript]] of probably also French origin dating to 1240.<ref>{{harvnb|Matthies|1992|p=526}}</ref> In [[navigation]], the earliest uses of harbor cranes are documented for [[Utrecht (city)|Utrecht]] in 1244, [[Antwerp]] in 1263, [[Brugge]] in 1288 and [[Hamburg]] in 1291,<ref name=\"Matheus 1996, 345\">{{harvnb|Matheus|1996|p=345}}</ref> while in [[England]] the treadwheel is not recorded before 1331.<ref name=\"Matthies 1992, 524\">{{harvnb|Matthies|1992|p=524}}</ref>\n\nGenerally, vertical transport could be done more safely and inexpensively by cranes than by customary methods. Typical areas of application were [[harbour]]s, [[mines]], and, in particular, building sites where the treadwheel crane played a pivotal role in the construction of the lofty [[Gothic architecture|Gothic cathedrals]]. Nevertheless, both archival and pictorial sources of the time suggest that newly introduced machines like treadwheels or [[wheelbarrow]]s did not completely replace more labor-intensive methods like [[ladder]]s, [[Brick hod|hods]] and handbarrows. Rather, old and new machinery continued to coexist on medieval construction sites<ref>{{harvnb|Matthies|1992|p=545}}</ref> and harbours.<ref name=\"Matheus 1996, 345\"/>\n\nApart from treadwheels, medieval depictions also show cranes to be powered manually by [[windlass]]es with radiating [[spoke]]s, [[Crank (mechanism)|cranks]] and by the 15th century also by windlasses shaped like a [[ship's wheel]]. To smooth out irregularities of [[impulse]] and get over 'dead-spots' in the lifting process [[flywheel]]s are known to be in use as early as 1123.<ref>{{harvnb|Matthies|1992|p=518}}</ref>\n\nThe exact process by which the treadwheel crane was reintroduced is not recorded,<ref name=\"Andrea Matthies, p.515\"/> although its return to construction sites has undoubtedly to be viewed in close connection with the simultaneous rise of [[Gothic architecture]]. The reappearance of the treadwheel crane may have resulted from a technological development of the [[windlass]] from which the treadwheel structurally and mechanically evolved. Alternatively, the [[medieval]] treadwheel may represent a deliberate reinvention of its Roman counterpart drawn from [[Vitruvius]]' ''[[De architectura]]'' which was available in many [[monastery|monastic libraries]]. Its reintroduction may have been inspired, as well, by the observation of the labor-saving qualities of the [[Water wheel|waterwheel]] with which early treadwheels shared many structural similarities.<ref name=\"Matthies 1992, 524\"/>\n\n==== Structure and placement ====\n[[File:Reconstruction of the temple of Jerusalem.jpg|thumb|Single treadwheel crane working from top of the building]]\n\nThe medieval treadwheel was a large wooden wheel turning around a [[Axle|central shaft]] with a treadway wide enough for two workers walking side by side. While the earlier 'compass-arm' wheel had spokes directly driven into the central shaft, the more advanced 'clasp-arm' type featured arms arranged as chords to the wheel rim,<ref>{{harvnb|Matthies|1992|pp=525f.}}</ref> giving the possibility of using a thinner shaft and providing thus a greater mechanical advantage.<ref>{{harvnb|Matthies|1992|p=536}}</ref>\n\nContrary to a popularly held belief, cranes on medieval building sites were neither placed on the extremely lightweight [[scaffolding]] used at the time nor on the thin walls of the Gothic churches which were incapable of supporting the weight of both hoisting machine and load. Rather, cranes were placed in the initial stages of construction on the ground, often within the building. When a new floor was completed, and massive tie beams of the roof connected the walls, the crane was dismantled and reassembled on the roof beams from where it was moved from bay to bay during construction of the vaults.<ref name=\"Matthies 1992, 533\">{{harvnb|Matthies|1992|p=533}}</ref> Thus, the crane \u2018grew\u2019 and \u2018wandered\u2019 with the building with the result that today all extant construction cranes in England are found in church towers above the vaulting and below the roof, where they remained after building construction for bringing material for repairs aloft.<ref>{{harvnb|Matthies|1992|pp=532ff.}}</ref>\n\nLess frequently, medieval illuminations also show cranes mounted on the outside of walls with the stand of the machine secured to putlogs.<ref>{{harvnb|Matthies|1992|p=535}}</ref>\n\n==== Mechanics and operation ====\n[[File:Medieval crane - Brugge.jpg|thumb|Reconstructed gantry crane of [[Brugge]] operated by two lateral treadwheels]]\n\nIn contrast to modern cranes, medieval cranes and hoists - much like their counterparts in Greece and Rome<ref name=\"Coulton 1974, 6\" >{{harvnb|Coulton|1974|p=6}}</ref> - were primarily capable of a vertical lift, and not used to move loads for a considerable distance horizontally as well.<ref name=\"Matthies 1992, 533\"/> Accordingly, lifting work was organized at the workplace in a different way than today. In building construction, for example, it is assumed that the crane lifted the stone blocks either from the bottom directly into place,<ref name=\"Matthies 1992, 533\"/> or from a place opposite the centre of the wall from where it could deliver the blocks for two teams working at each end of the wall.<ref name=\"Coulton 1974, 6\"/> Additionally, the crane master who usually gave orders at the treadwheel workers from outside the crane was able to manipulate the movement laterally by a small rope attached to the load.<ref name=\"Dienel, Meigh\u00f6rner 1997, 17\">{{harvnb|Dienel|Meigh\u00f6rner|1997|p=17}}</ref> Slewing cranes which allowed a rotation of the load and were thus particularly suited for dockside work appeared as early as 1340.<ref>{{harvnb|Matthies|1992|p=534}}</ref> While ashlar blocks were directly lifted by sling, lewis or devil's clamp (German ''Teufelskralle''), other objects were placed before in containers like [[pallet]]s, [[basket]]s, wooden boxes or [[barrel]]s.<ref>{{harvnb|Matthies|1992|p=531}}</ref>\n\nIt is noteworthy that medieval cranes rarely featured [[Ratchet (device)|ratchets]] or [[brake]]s to forestall the load from running backward.<ref>{{harvnb|Matthies|1992|p=540}}</ref> This curious absence is explained by the high [[Friction|friction force]] exercised by medieval treadwheels which normally prevented the wheel from accelerating beyond control.<ref name=\"Dienel, Meigh\u00f6rner 1997, 17\"/>\n\n==== Harbour usage ====\n[[File:Trier Germany Alter Krahnen.jpg|thumb|left|Tower crane at the inland harbour of [[Trier]] from 1413]]\n\nAccording to the \"present state of knowledge\" unknown in antiquity, stationary harbour cranes are considered a new development of the Middle Ages.<ref name=\"Matheus 1996, 345\"/> The typical harbour crane was a pivoting structure equipped with double treadwheels. These cranes were placed docksides for the loading and unloading of cargo where they replaced or complemented older lifting methods like [[see-saw]]s, [[winch]]es and [[Yard (sailing)|yards]].<ref name=\"Matheus 1996, 345\"/>\n\nTwo different types of harbour cranes can be identified with a varying geographical distribution: While gantry cranes which pivoted on a central vertical axle were commonly found at the Flemish and Dutch coastside, German sea and inland harbours typically featured tower cranes where the windlass and treadwheels were situated in a solid tower with only jib arm and roof rotating.<ref name=\"Matheus 1996, 346\">{{harvnb|Matheus|1996|p=346}}</ref> Dockside cranes were not adopted in the Mediterranean region and the highly developed Italian ports where authorities continued to rely on the more labor-intensive method of unloading goods by ramps beyond the Middle Ages.<ref>{{harvnb|Matheus|1996|p=347}}</ref>\n\nUnlike construction cranes where the work speed was determined by the relatively slow progress of the masons, harbour cranes usually featured double treadwheels to speed up loading. The two treadwheels whose diameter is estimated to be 4&nbsp;m or larger were attached to each side of the axle and rotated together.<ref name=\"Matheus 1996, 345\"/> Their capacity was 2\u20133 tons which apparently corresponded to the customary size of marine cargo.<ref name=\"Matheus 1996, 345\"/> Today, according to one survey, fifteen treadwheel harbour cranes from pre-industrial times are still extant throughout Europe.<ref>These are Bergen, Stockholm, Karlskrona (Sweden), Kopenhagen (Denmark), Harwich (England), Gda\u0144sk (Poland), L\u00fcneburg, Stade, Otterndorf, Marktbreit, W\u00fcrzburg, \u00d6strich, Bingen, Andernach and Trier (Germany). Cf. {{harvnb|Matheus|1996|p=346}}</ref> Some harbour cranes were specialised at mounting masts to newly built sailing ships, such as in [[Danzig]], [[Cologne]] and [[Bremen]].<ref name=\"Matheus 1996, 346\"/> Beside these stationary cranes, [[crane vessel|floating cranes]] which could be flexibly deployed in the whole port basin came into use by the 14th century.<ref name=\"Matheus 1996, 346\"/>\n\n== Surviving examples ==\n{{Further|List of historical harbour cranes}}\n\n=== Original ===\nA treadwheel crane survives at [[Chesterfield]], [[Derbyshire]] and is housed in the Museum.

In the United States the truck system and associated debt bondage persisted until the strikes of the newly formed [[United Mine Workers]] and affiliated [[labour union|unions]] forced an end to such practices.\n\n==Other versions==\n{{Infobox song\n| name       = Sixteen Tons\n| cover      =\n| alt        =\n| type       = Song\n| artist     = [[Tennessee Ernie Ford]]\n| album      = Ford Favorites\n| A-side     = [[You Don't Have to Be a Baby to Cry]]\n| released   = October 1955\n| format     = [[Gramophone record|7\" 45, 10\" 78]]\n| recorded   = 1955\n| studio     =\n| venue      =\n| genre      = [[Country music|Country]]\n| length     = 2:34\n| label      = [[Capitol Records|Capitol]]\n| writer     = [[Merle Travis]]\n| producer   = Jack Fascinato\n| prev_title = His Hands\n| prev_year  = 1955\n| next_title = [[That's All (1952 song)|That's All]]\n| next_year  = 1955\n| misc       = [[File:Sixteen Tons - Chorus - Ernie Ford.ogg|thumb|right|The chorus sung by Tennessee Ernie Ford]]\n}}\n[[Tennessee Ernie Ford]] recorded \"Sixteen Tons\" in 1955 as the [[A-side and B-side|B-side]] of his cover of the [[Moon Mullican]] standard \"[[You Don't Have to Be a Baby to Cry]]\".
