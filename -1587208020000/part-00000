He debuted for them in 1919 and became Kiwi number 125<ref>{{cite news\n| title = Kiwis Roll of Honour\n| publisher = New Zealand Rugby League\n| url =https://nzrl.co.nz/kiwis-home/past-kiwis/\n| accessdate = 2020-04-08}}</ref>. He played his club rugby league for the [[Grafton Athletic]] and [[Newton Rangers]] teams in the [[Auckland Rugby League]] competition. He later moved to [[Tauranga]] and played for Tauranga and [[Bay of Plenty Steamers|Bay of Plenty]] at rugby union including against the touring [[Springbok national rugby union team|Springbok]] team in 1921. In 1922 he made an effort to establish Rugby League in the Tauranga area which failed however he did play matches for Tauranga and a Bay of Plenty league team who played against Auckland and the touring [[New South Wales rugby league team|New South Wales]] team.\n\n==Early Life==\nGeorge Iles grew up in [[Christchurch]]. He was the son of Harriet and Albert Iles, whose parents had come to New Zealand in one of the first \u201cfour ships\u201d which brought settlers to [[Canterbury, New Zealand|Canterbury]]<ref>{{cite news\n| title = Obituary/Mr Albert Iles\n| page = 2\n| publisher = Bay of Plenty Times, Volume LV, Issue 9359\n| date = 1926-12-09\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/BOPT19261209.2.9\n| accessdate = 2020-04-09}}</ref>.\nAlbert was a successful sportsman in his own right captaining the Sydenham Football Club in the 1880s and representing [[Canterbury Rugby Football Union|Canterbury]] and [[Rugby Southland|Southland]] for several years. He was also a champion runner. In 1912 the family moved to [[Auckland]] where they lived until 1919 and it was during these years that George made a name for himself as a rugby league player.\n\n==Rugby League and Rugby Union Playing Career==\n===Auckland and New Zealand Rugby League===\nGeorge Iles began his playing career for [[Grafton Athletic]] with his name first appearing in a team list for their second grade team in 1914 along with his brother Arthur Iles <ref>{{cite news\n| title = Under League Rules/Fixtures and Teams/Grafton Club\n| page = 10\n| publisher = New Zealand Herald, Volume LI, Issue 15621\n| date = 1914-05-29\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/NZH19140529.2.132.1\n| accessdate = 2020-04-08}}</ref>. The following season he debuted for the Grafton senior team and played in the [[1915 Auckland Rugby League season|Auckland first grade competition]]. He was fortunate to play alongside the likes of New Zealand rugby league legends [[Karl Ifwersen]] and [[Dougie McGregor]], the later having already played for the [[New Zealand national rugby union team|All Blacks]] rugby team<ref>{{cite news\n| title = The League Game Notes and Comments\n| page = 10\n| publisher = New Zealand Herald, Volume LII, Issue 15915\n| date = 1915-05-12\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/NZH19150512.2.124.1\n| accessdate = 2020-04-08}}</ref>. Grafton were to win the Auckland title [[1915 Auckland Rugby League season|this season]].\n\nBoth George and Arthur were to transfer to the [[Newton Rangers]] team for the [[1916 Auckland Rugby League season|1916 season]]. Newton struggled and finished last however Iles did score 7 out of Newton\u2019s 20 tries making him the second highest try scorer for the entire competition. The following year he went even better scoring 12 tries and leading the try scorer lists in the [[1917 Auckland Rugby League season|1917 competition]].\n\nIn 1918 Iles scored 4 tries for Newton and was also elected secretary of the club at their annual meeting<ref>{{cite news\n| title = Newton Rangers Club\n| page = 7\n| publisher = New Zealand Herald, Volume LV, Issue 16814\n| date = 1918-04-03\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/NZH19180403.2.60\n| accessdate = 2020-04-08}}</ref>. He gained his first representative jersey when he was selected for the [[Auckland rugby league team|Auckland]] team for, at that time, a very rare representative fixture. During the war years the [[Auckland Rugby League]] had deliberately played almost no representative matches. The match was against [[Canterbury rugby league team|Canterbury]] and played at the [[Auckland Domain]] in front of 10,000 spectators. Auckland won 45-9 with Iles scoring a try in the corner \u201cafter a cross-field run\u201d <ref>{{cite news\n| title =Auckland Defeats Canterbury/Forty-Five Points to Nine\n| page =3\n| publisher = New Zealand Herald, Volume LV, Issue 16956\n| date = 1918-09-16\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/NZH19180916.2.15.1\n| accessdate = 2019-08-10}}</ref>.\n\nOnce again in [[1919 Auckland Rugby League season|1919]] Iles was a prolific try scorer for Newton notching 10 tries in total including tries in the Roope Rooster semi final against [[Ponsonby Ponies|Ponsonby United]], and the semi final replay against the same opponents when the first match was abandoned near the end after Ponsonby fans encroached on the field and refused to move. Newton went on to win the Roope Rooster for the first time in their clubs history<ref>{{cite news\n| title =Roope Rooster Competition/Final Won by Newton/Game Played in Downpour\n| page =4\n| publisher =New Zealand Herald, Volume LVI, Issue 17253\n| date = 1919-09-01\n| url = https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/NZH19190901.2.9.1\n| accessdate = 2019-08-20}}</ref>. \n\nIles was picked to play for Auckland against New Zealand on May 24. It was the first of 3 games he would play for them this season. The match was a warmup for the Australian Tour for the New Zealand side and was won by New Zealand 25-19 in front of 8,000 spectators at the [[Auckland Domain]] <ref>{{cite news\n| title =New Zealand Beats Auckland/Keenly Contested Game\n| page =9\n| publisher = New Zealand Herald, Volume LVI, Issue 17170\n| date = 1919-05-26\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/NZH19190526.2.105.1\n| accessdate = 2019-08-10}}</ref>. His next appearance was against the Returned Soldiers team as part of the Peace Day celebration program. It was held at the Auckland Domain on July 20 and featured athletics, rugby union, rugby league, football, and hockey matches. The Returned Soldiers team won 26-24 with Iles scoring two second half tries for the losing Auckland team<ref>{{cite news\n| title =Northern Union Grade\n| page =9\n| publisher = Auckland Star, Volume L, Issue 172\n| date = 1919-07-22\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/AS19190722.2.130\n| accessdate = 2019-08-10}}</ref>. His last ever match in an Auckland jersey was played against [[Rugby League Hawkes Bay|Hawke\u2019s Bay]] at [[Eden Park]] on August 9 with 9,000 watching on. Iles scored two more tries. The first after receiving a pass from [[Bert Laing]] and \u201ccutting in neatly and scoring\u201d, while his second saw him picking up the ball in the open \u201coutpacing the opposition and swerving past McCarthy [to score] a good try\u201d<ref>{{cite news\n| title =Representative Match/Auckland V Hawke\u2019s Bay\n| page =9\n| publisher =New Zealand Herald, Volume LVI, Issue 17235\n| date = 1911-08-11\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/NZH19190811.2.111.1\n| accessdate = 2019-08-18}}</ref>.\n\nIles was to make his [[New Zealand national rugby league team|New Zealand]] debut two weeks later. He played all of his 4 matches for New Zealand in 4 consecutive weekends. New Zealand had sent a touring team to [[Australia]] where they had played 11 matches against various teams but no tests<ref>{{cite news\n| title = All Blacks Tour 1919\n| publisher = Rugby League Project\n| url = https://www.rugbyleagueproject.org/competitions/all-blacks-tour-1919/summary.html\n| accessdate = 2020-04-08}}</ref>.

Iles had played in a trial on May 14 to make the tour but was not selected.\n\nOn August 23 he played his first test for New Zealand at the [[Basin Reserve]] in [[Wellington]] and went down 21-44 in front of 8,000 spectators<ref>{{cite news\n| title = League Football/Australia V New Zealand\n| page = 7\n| publisher = Dominion, Volume 12, Issue 282\n| date = 1919-08-25\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/DOM19190825.2.88\n| accessdate = 2020-04-08}}</ref>. Iles had a happier time of it in the second test which New Zealand won at Sydenham Park in [[Christchurch]]. Iles scored a try which was described \u201cfollowing an exchange of kicks between the two full-backs the New Zealanders swept down in a line and Iles got over\u201d, this made the score 21-2 to New Zealand.

Iles was listed to play in the reserves a week later for the Auckland team to play Australia but he did not take the field in an 8-32 loss.\n\n===Move to Tauranga and Switch to Rugby Union===\nIn 1920 George Iles moved to Tauranga with his family. There because rugby league was barely played he largely played rugby union over the following decade for Tauranga and the [[Bay of Plenty Steamers|Bay of Plenty]] representative team. In July 1920 he played for Tauranga against Grammar Old Boys. It was said \u201cof the Tauranga team the Isles [sic] brothers, three quarters, played well, and if supported by other members of the back division, would have made things a bit more awkward for the visitors. They both handled the ball well\u201d <ref>{{cite news\n| title = Grammar Old Boys v Tauranga\n| page = 8\n| publisher = Observer, Volume XL, Issue 45\n| date = 1920-07-10\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/TO19200710.2.13.1\n| accessdate = 2020-04-08}}</ref>. In a bizarre situation Iles played for Auckland against his own Bay of Plenty union in a match on 31 July when an Auckland back was unable to make the trip to Tauranga and Iles was asked to take his place. Bay of Plenty won 17-10 but Iles played brilliantly and comment was made that he shouldn't have been left out of the Bay team in the first place\n<ref>{{cite news\n| title =Bay of Plenty Footballers Defeat Auckland Representatives\n| page =3\n| publisher =Bay of Plenty Times, Volume XLVIII, Issue 7464, 2 August 1920, Page 3\n| date = 1920-08-02\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/BOPT19200802.2.9\n| accessdate = 2020-04-10}}</ref>. In September Iles made a return to [[Eden Park]], this time in a Bay of Plenty rugby jersey where they were defeated 17-34 to Auckland.

His debut season in the code continued to be an impressive one. In a match for Tauranga against Te Puke in the Kusab Cup he ran in 3 tries in a 9-6 win\n<ref>{{cite news\n| title =Keen Football Contest in Te Puke on Saturday for the Kusab Cup\n| page =2\n| publisher =Bay of Plenty Times, Volume XLVIII, Issue 7474, 16 August 1920, Page 2\n| date = 1920-08-16\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/BOPT19200816.2.8\n| accessdate = 2020-04-10}}</ref>.

The match was played at [[Rotorua]] with 5,000 spectators present to witness the Springboks win by 17 points to 9. Iles helped set up the Bay of Plenty sides only try to David Werahiko Borell when Montgomery \u201csent the ball across to Iles who opened up splendidly, and the ball came across to Borell, who scored near the corner\u201d <ref>{{cite news\n| title = Springboks Beat Bay of Plenty\n| page = 3\n| publisher = Bay of Plenty Times, Volume 49, Issue 7781\n| date = 1921-08-25\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/BOPT19210825.2.13\n| accessdate = 2020-04-08}}</ref>.\n\n===Effort to Introduce Rugby League to Tauranga===\nDespite these fine rugby achievements it appears that Iles had not forgotten his rugby league background. He was part of an effort to establish rugby league in the [[Tauranga]] area in 1922. The Tauranga Rugby League was started and they looked to play rugby league teams from other areas. The league was officially formed in March, 1922 <ref>{{cite news| title = Under League Rules/Decisions of Executive\n| page = 3\n| publisher = New Zealand Herald, Volume LIX, Issue 18053, 30 March 1922, Page 3\n| date = 1922-03-30\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/NZH19220330.2.16.8\n| accessdate = 2020-04-10}}</ref>.

On April 12 he wrote a letter to the [[Bay of Plenty Times]] about the strength of the rugby league code in various places and was writing in response to a query about why rugby league had been started in the area by Mr. Phelan, a past member of the Tauranga rugby selection committee. Iles responded in a lengthy letter \u201cthe answer is the same as that to why the League game was first commenced \u2013 that is dissatisfaction with Rugby management\u201d, he went on to say \u201ctouching on the standard of play in League, as one who has played both codes I give it as my opinion that League is played on a far higher standard in [[Australia]] and [[Auckland]] than Rugby\u201d <ref>{{cite news\n| title = Public Opinion/Rival Codes\n| page = 4\n| publisher = Bay of Plenty Times, Volume L, Issue 7961\n| date = 1922-04-13\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/BOPT19220413.2.27\n| accessdate = 2020-04-08}}</ref>.

Tauranga took on the Rotorua team on the Tauranga Domain. As well as George Iles playing, David Borell and Arthur Iles also played in the match. Rotorua won a high scoring match 29-28 with both Iles and Borell scoring tries\n<ref>{{cite news\n| title =Rotorua Wins by One Point\n| page =4\n| publisher =Bay of Plenty Times, Volume LI, Issue 8092\n| date = 1922-09-18\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/BOPT19220918.2.24\n| accessdate = 2020-04-10}}</ref>.\n\nA game against the touring [[New South Wales rugby league team|New South Wales]] was also arranged which was a remarkable achievement in itself given that rugby league was not even played in the area until a month earlier. The match was between New South Wales and Bay of Plenty. George Iles naturally played and the team also featured future Kiwi [[George Gardiner (rugby league)|George Gardiner]] while the visiting NSW team featured the likes of [[Frank Burge]] and [[Reg Latta]].

Efforts were then made to arrange a match with an Auckland team and this eventuated with Auckland sending a very strong team down to play in Tauranga on October 7. It wasn\u2019t a Tauranga side who took on Auckland rather a Bay of Plenty team with players from throughout the district. George Iles captained the Bay of Plenty side and they performed well only going down 27-33 to an Auckland team which featured a large number of New Zealand international players such as [[Clarrie Polson]], [[Wally Somers]], and future Kiwi\u2019s [[Lou Brown (rugby league)|Lou Brown]], [[Neville St George]], and [[James Lawrence O\u2019Brien|Jim Brown]].<ref>{{cite news\n| title =Auckland League Team in Tauranga/Match Against Bay of Plenty\n| page = 3\n| work = Bay of Plenty Times| volume=LI| issue=8109\n| date = 1922-10-07\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/BOPT19221007.2.15\n| accessdate = 2020-03-11}}</ref>. Iles scored a try against his former team.\n\nIn September Iles went on the attack again, this time in response to the suggestion by rugby supporters that league players were being paid. He was writing as a member of Tauranga Rugby League and challenged \u201cany member of the Rugby Union to produce evidence of proof of any monetary benefits received by players or officers of the Tauranga Rugby League.

These efforts to grow the game in the area, while somewhat remarkable, ultimately proved futile and Iles returned to the rugby union field the following season.\n\n===Back to Rugby Union===\nIn 1923 he played for Tauranga rugby team against Te Puke in [[Te Puke]] and then again in the return match in [[Tauranga]].

He debuted for them in 1919 and became Kiwi number 125<ref>{{cite news\n| title = Kiwis Roll of Honour\n| publisher = New Zealand Rugby League\n| url =https://nzrl.co.nz/kiwis-home/past-kiwis/\n| accessdate = 2020-04-08}}</ref>. He played his club rugby league for the [[Grafton Athletic]] and [[Newton Rangers]] teams in the [[Auckland Rugby League]] competition. He later moved to [[Tauranga]] and played for Tauranga and [[Bay of Plenty Steamers|Bay of Plenty]] at rugby union including against the touring [[Springbok national rugby union team|Springbok]] team in 1921. In 1922 he made an effort to establish Rugby League in the Tauranga area which failed however he did play matches for Tauranga and a Bay of Plenty league team who played against Auckland and the touring [[New South Wales rugby league team|New South Wales]] team.\n\n==Early Life==\nGeorge Iles grew up in [[Christchurch]]. He was the son of Harriet and Albert Iles, whose parents had come to New Zealand in one of the first \u201cfour ships\u201d which brought settlers to [[Canterbury, New Zealand|Canterbury]]<ref>{{cite news\n| title = Obituary/Mr Albert Iles\n| page = 2\n| publisher = Bay of Plenty Times, Volume LV, Issue 9359\n| date = 1926-12-09\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/BOPT19261209.2.9\n| accessdate = 2020-04-09}}</ref>.\nAlbert was a successful sportsman in his own right captaining the Sydenham Football Club in the 1880s and representing [[Canterbury Rugby Football Union|Canterbury]] and [[Rugby Southland|Southland]] for several years. He was also a champion runner. In 1912 the family moved to [[Auckland]] where they lived until 1919 and it was during these years that George made a name for himself as a rugby league player.\n\n==Rugby League and Rugby Union Playing Career==\n===Auckland and New Zealand Rugby League===\nGeorge Iles began his playing career for [[Grafton Athletic]] with his name first appearing in a team list for their second grade team in 1914 along with his brother Arthur Iles <ref>{{cite news\n| title = Under League Rules/Fixtures and Teams/Grafton Club\n| page = 10\n| publisher = New Zealand Herald, Volume LI, Issue 15621\n| date = 1914-05-29\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/NZH19140529.2.132.1\n| accessdate = 2020-04-08}}</ref>. The following season he debuted for the Grafton senior team and played in the [[1915 Auckland Rugby League season|Auckland first grade competition]]. He was fortunate to play alongside the likes of New Zealand rugby league legends [[Karl Ifwersen]] and [[Dougie McGregor]], the later having already played for the [[New Zealand national rugby union team|All Blacks]] rugby team<ref>{{cite news\n| title = The League Game Notes and Comments\n| page = 10\n| publisher = New Zealand Herald, Volume LII, Issue 15915\n| date = 1915-05-12\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/NZH19150512.2.124.1\n| accessdate = 2020-04-08}}</ref>. Grafton were to win the Auckland title [[1915 Auckland Rugby League season|this season]].\n\nBoth George and Arthur were to transfer to the [[Newton Rangers]] team for the [[1916 Auckland Rugby League season|1916 season]]. Newton struggled and finished last however Iles did score 7 out of Newton\u2019s 20 tries making him the second highest try scorer for the entire competition. The following year he went even better scoring 12 tries and leading the try scorer lists in the [[1917 Auckland Rugby League season|1917 competition]].\n\nIn 1918 Iles scored 4 tries for Newton and was also elected secretary of the club at their annual meeting<ref>{{cite news\n| title = Newton Rangers Club\n| page = 7\n| publisher = New Zealand Herald, Volume LV, Issue 16814\n| date = 1918-04-03\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/NZH19180403.2.60\n| accessdate = 2020-04-08}}</ref>. He gained his first representative jersey when he was selected for the [[Auckland rugby league team|Auckland]] team for, at that time, a very rare representative fixture. During the war years the [[Auckland Rugby League]] had deliberately played almost no representative matches. The match was against [[Canterbury rugby league team|Canterbury]] and played at the [[Auckland Domain]] in front of 10,000 spectators. Auckland won 45-9 with Iles scoring a try in the corner \u201cafter a cross-field run\u201d <ref>{{cite news\n| title =Auckland Defeats Canterbury/Forty-Five Points to Nine\n| page =3\n| publisher = New Zealand Herald, Volume LV, Issue 16956\n| date = 1918-09-16\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/NZH19180916.2.15.1\n| accessdate = 2019-08-10}}</ref>.\n\nOnce again in [[1919 Auckland Rugby League season|1919]] Iles was a prolific try scorer for Newton notching 10 tries in total including tries in the Roope Rooster semi final against [[Ponsonby Ponies|Ponsonby United]], and the semi final replay against the same opponents when the first match was abandoned near the end after Ponsonby fans encroached on the field and refused to move. Newton went on to win the Roope Rooster for the first time in their clubs history<ref>{{cite news\n| title =Roope Rooster Competition/Final Won by Newton/Game Played in Downpour\n| page =4\n| publisher =New Zealand Herald, Volume LVI, Issue 17253\n| date = 1919-09-01\n| url = https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/NZH19190901.2.9.1\n| accessdate = 2019-08-20}}</ref>. \n\nIles was picked to play for Auckland against New Zealand on May 24. It was the first of 3 games he would play for them this season. The match was a warmup for the Australian Tour for the New Zealand side and was won by New Zealand 25-19 in front of 8,000 spectators at the [[Auckland Domain]] <ref>{{cite news\n| title =New Zealand Beats Auckland/Keenly Contested Game\n| page =9\n| publisher = New Zealand Herald, Volume LVI, Issue 17170\n| date = 1919-05-26\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/NZH19190526.2.105.1\n| accessdate = 2019-08-10}}</ref>. His next appearance was against the Returned Soldiers team as part of the Peace Day celebration program. It was held at the Auckland Domain on July 20 and featured athletics, rugby union, rugby league, football, and hockey matches. The Returned Soldiers team won 26-24 with Iles scoring two second half tries for the losing Auckland team<ref>{{cite news\n| title =Northern Union Grade\n| page =9\n| publisher = Auckland Star, Volume L, Issue 172\n| date = 1919-07-22\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/AS19190722.2.130\n| accessdate = 2019-08-10}}</ref>. His last ever match in an Auckland jersey was played against [[Rugby League Hawkes Bay|Hawke\u2019s Bay]] at [[Eden Park]] on August 9 with 9,000 watching on. Iles scored two more tries. The first after receiving a pass from [[Bert Laing]] and \u201ccutting in neatly and scoring\u201d, while his second saw him picking up the ball in the open \u201coutpacing the opposition and swerving past McCarthy [to score] a good try\u201d<ref>{{cite news\n| title =Representative Match/Auckland V Hawke\u2019s Bay\n| page =9\n| publisher =New Zealand Herald, Volume LVI, Issue 17235\n| date = 1911-08-11\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/NZH19190811.2.111.1\n| accessdate = 2019-08-18}}</ref>.\n\nIles was to make his [[New Zealand national rugby league team|New Zealand]] debut two weeks later. He played all of his 4 matches for New Zealand in 4 consecutive weekends. New Zealand had sent a touring team to [[Australia]] where they had played 11 matches against various teams but no tests<ref>{{cite news\n| title = All Blacks Tour 1919\n| publisher = Rugby League Project\n| url = https://www.rugbyleagueproject.org/competitions/all-blacks-tour-1919/summary.html\n| accessdate = 2020-04-08}}</ref>.

Iles had played in a trial on May 14 to make the tour but was not selected.\n\nOn August 23 he played his first test for New Zealand at the [[Basin Reserve]] in [[Wellington]] and went down 21-44 in front of 8,000 spectators<ref>{{cite news\n| title = League Football/Australia V New Zealand\n| page = 7\n| publisher = Dominion, Volume 12, Issue 282\n| date = 1919-08-25\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/DOM19190825.2.88\n| accessdate = 2020-04-08}}</ref>. Iles had a happier time of it in the second test which New Zealand won at Sydenham Park in [[Christchurch]]. Iles scored a try which was described \u201cfollowing an exchange of kicks between the two full-backs the New Zealanders swept down in a line and Iles got over\u201d, this made the score 21-2 to New Zealand.

Iles was listed to play in the reserves a week later for the Auckland team to play Australia but he did not take the field in an 8-32 loss.\n\n===Move to Tauranga and Switch to Rugby Union===\nIn 1920 George Iles moved to Tauranga with his family. There because rugby league was barely played he largely played rugby union over the following decade for Tauranga and the [[Bay of Plenty Steamers|Bay of Plenty]] representative team. In July 1920 he played for Tauranga against Grammar Old Boys. It was said \u201cof the Tauranga team the Isles [sic] brothers, three quarters, played well, and if supported by other members of the back division, would have made things a bit more awkward for the visitors. They both handled the ball well\u201d <ref>{{cite news\n| title = Grammar Old Boys v Tauranga\n| page = 8\n| publisher = Observer, Volume XL, Issue 45\n| date = 1920-07-10\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/TO19200710.2.13.1\n| accessdate = 2020-04-08}}</ref>. In a bizarre situation Iles played for Auckland against his own Bay of Plenty union in a match on 31 July when an Auckland back was unable to make the trip to Tauranga and Iles was asked to take his place. Bay of Plenty won 17-10 but Iles played brilliantly and comment was made that he shouldn't have been left out of the Bay team in the first place\n<ref>{{cite news\n| title =Bay of Plenty Footballers Defeat Auckland Representatives\n| page =3\n| publisher =Bay of Plenty Times, Volume XLVIII, Issue 7464, 2 August 1920, Page 3\n| date = 1920-08-02\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/BOPT19200802.2.9\n| accessdate = 2020-04-10}}</ref>.

His debut season in the code continued to be an impressive one. In a match for Tauranga against Te Puke in the Kusab Cup he ran in 3 tries in a 9-6 win\n<ref>{{cite news\n| title =Keen Football Contest in Te Puke on Saturday for the Kusab Cup\n| page =2\n| publisher =Bay of Plenty Times, Volume XLVIII, Issue 7474, 16 August 1920, Page 2\n| date = 1920-08-16\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/BOPT19200816.2.8\n| accessdate = 2020-04-10}}</ref>.

The match was played at [[Rotorua]] with 5,000 spectators present to witness the Springboks win by 17 points to 9. Iles helped set up the Bay of Plenty sides only try to David Werahiko Borell when Montgomery \u201csent the ball across to Iles who opened up splendidly, and the ball came across to Borell, who scored near the corner\u201d <ref>{{cite news\n| title = Springboks Beat Bay of Plenty\n| page = 3\n| publisher = Bay of Plenty Times, Volume 49, Issue 7781\n| date = 1921-08-25\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/BOPT19210825.2.13\n| accessdate = 2020-04-08}}</ref>.\n\n===Effort to Introduce Rugby League to Tauranga===\nDespite these fine rugby achievements it appears that Iles had not forgotten his rugby league background. He was part of an effort to establish rugby league in the [[Tauranga]] area in 1922. The Tauranga Rugby League was started and they looked to play rugby league teams from other areas. The league was officially formed in March, 1922 <ref>{{cite news| title = Under League Rules/Decisions of Executive\n| page = 3\n| publisher = New Zealand Herald, Volume LIX, Issue 18053, 30 March 1922, Page 3\n| date = 1922-03-30\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/NZH19220330.2.16.8\n| accessdate = 2020-04-10}}</ref>.

On April 12 he wrote a letter to the [[Bay of Plenty Times]] about the strength of the rugby league code in various places and was writing in response to a query about why rugby league had been started in the area by Mr. Phelan, a past member of the Tauranga rugby selection committee. Iles responded in a lengthy letter \u201cthe answer is the same as that to why the League game was first commenced \u2013 that is dissatisfaction with Rugby management\u201d, he went on to say \u201ctouching on the standard of play in League, as one who has played both codes I give it as my opinion that League is played on a far higher standard in [[Australia]] and [[Auckland]] than Rugby\u201d <ref>{{cite news\n| title = Public Opinion/Rival Codes\n| page = 4\n| publisher = Bay of Plenty Times, Volume L, Issue 7961\n| date = 1922-04-13\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/BOPT19220413.2.27\n| accessdate = 2020-04-08}}</ref>.

Tauranga took on the Rotorua team on the Tauranga Domain. As well as George Iles playing, David Borell and Arthur Iles also played in the match. Rotorua won a high scoring match 29-28 with both Iles and Borell scoring tries\n<ref>{{cite news\n| title =Rotorua Wins by One Point\n| page =4\n| publisher =Bay of Plenty Times, Volume LI, Issue 8092\n| date = 1922-09-18\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/BOPT19220918.2.24\n| accessdate = 2020-04-10}}</ref>.\n\nA game against the touring [[New South Wales rugby league team|New South Wales]] was also arranged which was a remarkable achievement in itself given that rugby league was not even played in the area until a month earlier. The match was between New South Wales and Bay of Plenty. George Iles naturally played and the team also featured future Kiwi [[George Gardiner (rugby league)|George Gardiner]] while the visiting NSW team featured the likes of [[Frank Burge]] and [[Reg Latta]]. New South Wales won the match 29 points to 5 with Borell scoring a try and Joseph Rogers kicking a goal for the local team\n<ref>{{cite news\n| title =Kangaroos 29 Bay of Plenty 5\n| page =4\n| publisher =Bay of Plenty Times, Volume LI, Issue 8101\n| date = 1922-09-28\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/BOPT19220928.2.33\n| accessdate = 2020-04-11}}</ref>.\n\nOn September 30 Tauranga again made history by playing in the first ever rugby league game in [[Te Puke]] <ref>{{cite news\n| title = Local and General\n| page = 2\n| publisher = Bay of Plenty Times, Volume LI, Issue 8102\n| date = 1922-09-29\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/BOPT19220929.2.3\n| accessdate = 2020-04-10}}</ref>. Efforts were then made to arrange a match with an Auckland team and this eventuated with Auckland sending a very strong team down to play in Tauranga on October 7. It wasn\u2019t a Tauranga side who took on Auckland rather a Bay of Plenty team with players from throughout the district. George Iles captained the Bay of Plenty side and they performed well only going down 27-33 to an Auckland team which featured a large number of New Zealand international players such as [[Clarrie Polson]], [[Wally Somers]], and future Kiwi\u2019s [[Lou Brown (rugby league)|Lou Brown]], [[Neville St George]], and [[James Lawrence O\u2019Brien|Jim Brown]].<ref>{{cite news\n| title =Auckland League Team in Tauranga/Match Against Bay of Plenty\n| page = 3\n| work = Bay of Plenty Times| volume=LI| issue=8109\n| date = 1922-10-07\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/BOPT19221007.2.15\n| accessdate = 2020-03-11}}</ref>. Iles scored a try against his former team.\n\nIn September Iles went on the attack again, this time in response to the suggestion by rugby supporters that league players were being paid. He was writing as a member of Tauranga Rugby League and challenged \u201cany member of the Rugby Union to produce evidence of proof of any monetary benefits received by players or officers of the Tauranga Rugby League.

These efforts to grow the game in the area, while somewhat remarkable, ultimately proved futile and Iles returned to the rugby union field the following season.\n\n===Back to Rugby Union===\nIn 1923 he played for Tauranga rugby team against Te Puke in [[Te Puke]] and then again in the return match in [[Tauranga]].

He was most famous for his campaign in the [[Indian Ocean]], in which he fought a series of intense and evenly matched battles for [[Command of the sea|supremacy]] against the established British power there, led by Vice-Admiral Sir [[Edward Hughes (admiral)|Edward Hughes]]. [[Alfred T. Mahan]] praised Suffren as \"a very great man\" and evaluated him in terms he usually reserved for praising decisively victorious admirals.<ref>Mahan, ''Influence of Sea Power'', p. 416 et passim</ref>\n\n== Biography ==\n===Early life===\nPierre Andr\u00e9 de Suffren was born on July 17, 1729 in the Ch\u00e2teau de [[Saint-Cannat]] in the present ''[[d\u00e9partement in France|d\u00e9partement]]'' of [[Bouches-du-Rh\u00f4ne]]. He was the third son of [[Paul de Suffren]] (1679\u20131756), the marquis de [[Saint Tropez]], head of a family of nobles of [[Provence]].<ref>[http://gw.geneanet.org/pierfit?lang=en;p=paul;n=de+suffren Geneanet: Paul de Suffren]</ref> He grew up at the [[H\u00f4tel de Suffren]], a [[h\u00f4tel particulier]] located at 40 on the [[Cours Mirabeau]] in [[Aix-en-Provence]].\n\n===Early naval career===\nThe [[French Navy|French navy]] and the [[Knights Hospitaller|Order of Malta]] (where he received the title '''Bailli de Suffren''') offered the usual careers for the younger sons of noble families of the south of France who did not elect to go into the Church. The connection between the Order and the old French royal navy was close. Pierre Andr\u00e9 de Suffren was destined by his parents to belong to both. He entered the close and aristocratic corps of French naval officers as a \"garde de la marine\"\u2014cadet or midshipman, in October 1743, in ''Solide'', one of the line of battleships which took part in the confused engagement off [[Toulon]] in 1744. He was then in ''Pauline'' in the squadron of M. Macn\u00e9mara on a cruise in the [[West Indies]].{{sfn|Chisholm|1911}}\n\nIn 1746 he went through the [[Jean-Baptiste Louis Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric de La Rochefoucauld de Roye|duc D'Anville]]'s disastrous expedition to retake [[Cape Breton Island|Cape Breton]], which was ruined by shipwreck and plague. \nThe following year, in 1747, he was taken prisoner by [[Edward Hawke, 1st Baron Hawke|Hawke]] in the action with the French convoy in the [[Bay of Biscay]]. \nHis biographer [[Charles Cunat]] reports that he found the British arrogance offensive. When peace was made in 1748 he went to [[Malta]] to perform the cruises with the galleys of the Order technically called \"caravans,\" a reminiscence of the days when the knights protected the pilgrims going from [[Saint John d'Acre]] to [[Jerusalem]]. \nIn Suffren's time this service rarely went beyond a peaceful tour among the Greek islands, but it also involved piracy suppression operations against the wily [[Barbary states]] of North Africa.\n\n===Seven Years' War and afterward===\n{{further|France in the Seven Years War}}\n[[File:BailliDeSuffrenByBatoni.jpg|thumb|left|Suffren, by [[Pompeo Batoni]].]]\nDuring the [[Seven Years' War]] he was present as lieutenant in ''Orph\u00e9e'' in the action with [[John Byng|Admiral Byng]], which, if not strictly speaking a victory, was at least not a defeat for the French, and was followed by the surrender of the English garrison of [[Menorca]]. But in 1759 he was again taken prisoner, when [[Edward Boscawen|Boscawen]] captured his ship, {{ship|French ship|Oc\u00e9an|1756|2}}, at the [[Battle of Lagos (1759)|Battle of Lagos]]. On the return of peace in 1763 Suffren intended again to do the service in the caravans which was required to qualify him to hold the high and lucrative posts of the Order. He was, however, named to the command of ''Cam\u00e9l\u00e9on'', a [[xebec]]\u2014a vessel of mixed square and lateen rig peculiar to the [[Mediterranean]]\u2014in which he cruised against the [[Barbary pirates]].{{sfn|Chisholm|1911}}\n\nBetween 1767 and 1771 he performed his caravans, and was promoted from knight to commander of the Order. From that time till the beginning of the [[War of American Independence]] he commanded vessels in the squadron of evolution which the French government had established for the purpose of giving practice to its officers. His nerve and skill in handling his ship were highly commended by his chiefs;{{sfn|Chisholm|1911}} he has been called the best French naval commander of the 18th Century.\n\n===Operations against the British, 1770s\u20131780s===\n{{Main|Franco-American alliance}}\n[[File:Saint-Tropez Suffren (1)-white.jpg|thumb|Suffren's statue in [[Saint Tropez]].]]\nIn 1778 and 1779, Suffren formed part of the squadron of Vice-Amiral \u00e8s Mers d'Asie et d'Amerique [[Charles Hector, comte d'Estaing|D'Estaing]] throughout its operations on the coast of [[North America]] and in the [[West Indies]]. He led the line in the [[Battle of Grenada|action]] with [[John Byron|Admiral John Byron]] off [[Grenada]], and his ship, ''Fantasque'' (64), lost 62 men. His letters to his admiral show that he strongly disapproved of D'Estaing's half-hearted methods.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911}}\n\nIn 1780, he was captain of {{ship|French ship|Z\u00e9l\u00e9|1764|2}} (74), in the combined French and Spanish fleets which [[Action of 9 August 1780|captured a great English]] convoy in the [[Atlantic Ocean|Atlantic]]. His candour towards his chief, [[Luis de C\u00f3rdova y C\u00f3rdova]], had done him no harm in the opinion of D'Estaing.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911}}\n\nIt is said to have been largely by the advice of this admiral that Suffren was chosen to command a squadron of five ships of the line sent out to help the Dutch who had joined France and Spain to defend the Cape against an expected English attack, and then to go on to the East Indies. He sailed from [[Brest, France|Brest]] on March 22. On April 16, 1781 he found the English expedition on its way to the Cape under the command of Commodore, commonly called Governor, [[George Johnstone (royal navy)|George Johnstone]] (1730\u20131787), at anchor in [[Porto Praya]], [[Cape Verde Islands]]. Remembering how little respect Boscawen had shown for the neutrality of [[Portugal]] at [[Battle of Lagos (1759)|Lagos]], he attacked at once, in the [[Battle of Porto Praya]]. No serious losses were sustained by either side. Suffren pushed on to the Cape, which he saved from capture by Johnstone, and then made his way to the [[Isle de France (Mauritius)|Isle de France]] (now [[Mauritius]]), then held by the French. M. D'Orves, his superior officer, died as the united squadrons, now eleven sail of the line, were on their way to the Bay of Bengal.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911}}\n\n===Campaign against Sir Edward Hughes===\n{{Main|Franco-Indian alliances}}\n[[File:Lestevenon-buys-1784.jpg|thumb|upright|The envoys [[Mattheus Lestevenon]] and [[Gerard Brantsen]] presenting vice-admiral Pierre Andr\u00e9 Bailly de Suffren de Saint Tropez with a golden sword in 1784]]\n[[File:Suffren meeting with Haider Ali, 26 july 1782 engraved by J B Morret 1789.jpg|thumb|left|Suffren meeting with [[Hyder Ali]] in 1782, J.B. Morret engraving, 1789.]]\nThe campaign, which Suffren now conducted against the English admiral [[Edward Hughes (Royal Navy officer)|Sir Edward Hughes]] (1720?\u20131794), is famous for the number, severity and indecisiveness of the encounters between them. Four actions took place in 1782: the [[Battle of Sadras]] on February 17, 1782, south of [[Chennai|Madras]]; the [[Battle of Providien]] on April 12 near [[Trincomalee]]; the [[Battle of Negapatam (1782)]] on July 6 off [[Cuddalore]], after which Suffren seized upon the anchorage of Trincomalee compelling the small British garrison to surrender; and finally the [[Battle of Trincomalee]] near that port on September 3. No ship was lost by either side in any of these battles.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911}}\n\nHis activity encouraged [[Hyder Ali]], who was then at war with the [[British East India Company]]. He refused to return to the islands for the purpose of escorting the troops coming out under command of Bussy, maintaining that his proper purpose was to cripple the squadron of Sir Edward Hughes. During the north-east monsoon he would not go to the islands but refitted in the Malay ports in Sumatra, and returned with the south-west [[monsoon]] in 1783. Hyder Ali was dead, but [[Tipu Sahib|Tipu Sultan]], his son, was still at war with the Company. Bussy arrived and landed. He was slack in his conduct of the operations on shore, which hampered Suffren. Still, when Suffren met Hughes at the [[Battle of Cuddalore (1783)|Battle of Cuddalore]] (20 April 1783), with fifteen ships to eighteen, Suffren forced Hughes to retire to Madras, leaving the army then besieging C\u00fcddalore in a very dangerous position. The arrival of the news that peace had been made in Europe put a stop to hostilities, and Suffren returned to France.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911}}\n\n===Death===\n[[File:Suffren mg 7244.jpg|thumb|upright|Bust of Suffren by [[Isidore-Hippolyte Brion|Brion]], on display at [[Paris naval museum]].]]\nWhile refitting at the Cape on his way home, several of the vessels also returning put in, and the captains waited on him. Suffren said in one of his letters that their praise gave him more pleasure than any other compliment paid him. In France he was received with enthusiasm, and in 1781 he succeeded Comte d'Aubigny unopposed to the office of vice-[[admiral of France]] (Ponant or the Atlantic). He had been promoted bailli in the Order of Malta during his absence. His death occurred very suddenly, when he was about to take command of a fleet collected in Brest. He died of apoplexy, due to a \"gout travelling upwards added to a putrid abscess\"<ref>Letter of Suffren's valet, quote in Glachant, p.377; quoted in Taillemite, p.323</ref><ref group=note>\"''Goutte remont\u00e9e jointe \u00e0 un abc\u00e8s putride</ref>\n\nA legend has it that many years afterwards his body servant told M. Jal, the historiographer of the French navy, that he had been killed in a duel by the Prince de Mirepoix. The cause of the encounter, according to the servant, was that Suffren had refused in very strong language to use his influence to secure the restoration to the navy of two of the prince's relations who had been dismissed for misconduct.\n\n==Legacy==\nSuffren was crippled to a large extent by the want of loyal and capable co-operation on the part of his captains. This was, in no small part, his own fault: his bullying and openly expressed contempt for his subordinates undermined their support for him in battle, depriving him of the successes which his undoubted tactical ability and determination might otherwise have made possible. He had, however, an indefatigable energy, a wealth of resource and a thorough understanding of the fact that success at sea is won by defeating an enemy and not by merely outmanoeuvering him. This made him a formidable foe.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911}} Suffren was perhaps the ablest sea-commander that France ever produced.<ref>{{Cite EB1911 |wstitle=Hughes, Sir Edward |volume=13 |page=660}}</ref>\n \nSuffren's achievements may seem modest but even this record stands in stark contrast to the failures of most contemporary French naval commanders. Any assessment must acknowledge that he succeeded at the tasks assigned to him. He  revived French fortunes in India when Paris had conceived his tasks as essentially ones of armed transportation and privateering. That his achievement went beyond these duties despite a lack of support from his uncomprehending superiors and battle shy captains adds greatly to his credit and  perhaps explains his personal fury. Ironically, if anybody learned from his example, it was the British, who were confirmed in their longstanding policy of seeking outright victory in naval engagements. French military policy made naval operations subordinate to land operations, yet Suffren realized that in wars fought overseas from the mother country, the nation which controlled the sea first had a great advantage in supporting the land war:\n\n{{quote|The military situation... demanded first the disabling of the hostile fleet, next the capture of certain strategic ports. That this diagnosis was correct is as certain as that it reversed the common French maxims, which would have put the port first and the fleet second as objectives.<ref>Mahan, A.T., ''The Influence of Sea Power Upon History 1660\u20131783, p. 433 {{ISBN|0-486-25509-3}}</ref>}}\n\nSeven ships of the French Navy have been named ''Suffren'' in honour of Suffren de Saint Tropez.

D'Orves, his superior officer, died as the united squadrons, now eleven sail of the line, were on their way to the Bay of Bengal.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911}}\n\n===Campaign against Sir Edward Hughes===\n{{Main|Franco-Indian alliances}}\n[[File:Lestevenon-buys-1784.jpg|thumb|upright|The envoys [[Mattheus Lestevenon]] and [[Gerard Brantsen]] presenting vice-admiral Pierre Andr\u00e9 Bailly de Suffren de Saint Tropez with a golden sword in 1784]]\n[[File:Suffren meeting with Haider Ali, 26 july 1782 engraved by J B Morret 1789.jpg|thumb|left|Suffren meeting with [[Hyder Ali]] in 1782, J.B. Morret engraving, 1789.]]\nThe campaign, which Suffren now conducted against the English admiral [[Edward Hughes (Royal Navy officer)|Sir Edward Hughes]] (1720?\u20131794), is famous for the number, severity and indecisiveness of the encounters between them. Four actions took place in 1782: the [[Battle of Sadras]] on February 17, 1782, south of [[Chennai|Madras]]; the [[Battle of Providien]] on April 12 near [[Trincomalee]]; the [[Battle of Negapatam (1782)]] on July 6 off [[Cuddalore]], after which Suffren seized upon the anchorage of Trincomalee compelling the small British garrison to surrender; and finally the [[Battle of Trincomalee]] near that port on September 3. No ship was lost by either side in any of these battles.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911}}\n\nHis activity encouraged [[Hyder Ali]], who was then at war with the [[British East India Company]]. He refused to return to the islands for the purpose of escorting the troops coming out under command of Bussy, maintaining that his proper purpose was to cripple the squadron of Sir Edward Hughes. During the north-east monsoon he would not go to the islands but refitted in the Malay ports in Sumatra, and returned with the south-west [[monsoon]] in 1783. Hyder Ali was dead, but [[Tipu Sahib|Tipu Sultan]], his son, was still at war with the Company. Bussy arrived and landed. He was slack in his conduct of the operations on shore, which hampered Suffren. Still, when Suffren met Hughes at the [[Battle of Cuddalore (1783)|Battle of Cuddalore]] (20 April 1783), with fifteen ships to eighteen, Suffren forced Hughes to retire to Madras, leaving the army then besieging C\u00fcddalore in a very dangerous position. The arrival of the news that peace had been made in Europe put a stop to hostilities, and Suffren returned to France.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911}}\n\n==Death==\n[[File:Suffren mg 7244.jpg|thumb|upright|Bust of Suffren by [[Isidore-Hippolyte Brion|Brion]], on display at [[Paris naval museum]].]]\nWhile refitting at the Cape on his way home, several of the vessels also returning put in, and the captains waited on him. Suffren said in one of his letters that their praise gave him more pleasure than any other compliment paid him. In France he was received with enthusiasm, and in 1781 he succeeded Comte d'Aubigny unopposed to the office of vice-[[admiral of France]] (Ponant or the Atlantic). He had been promoted bailli in the Order of Malta during his absence. His death occurred very suddenly, when he was about to take command of a fleet collected in Brest. He died of apoplexy, due to a \"gout travelling upwards added to a putrid abscess\"<ref>Letter of Suffren's valet, quote in Glachant, p.377; quoted in Taillemite, p.323</ref><ref group=note>\"''Goutte remont\u00e9e jointe \u00e0 un abc\u00e8s putride</ref>\n\nA legend has it that many years afterwards his body servant told M. Jal, the historiographer of the French navy, that he had been killed in a duel by the Prince de Mirepoix. The cause of the encounter, according to the servant, was that Suffren had refused in very strong language to use his influence to secure the restoration to the navy of two of the prince's relations who had been dismissed for misconduct.\n\n==Legacy==\nSuffren was crippled to a large extent by the want of loyal and capable co-operation on the part of his captains. This was, in no small part, his own fault: his bullying and openly expressed contempt for his subordinates undermined their support for him in battle, depriving him of the successes which his undoubted tactical ability and determination might otherwise have made possible. He had, however, an indefatigable energy, a wealth of resource and a thorough understanding of the fact that success at sea is won by defeating an enemy and not by merely outmanoeuvering him. This made him a formidable foe.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911}} Suffren was perhaps the ablest sea-commander that France ever produced.<ref>{{Cite EB1911 |wstitle=Hughes, Sir Edward |volume=13 |page=660}}</ref>\n \nSuffren's achievements may seem modest but even this record stands in stark contrast to the failures of most contemporary French naval commanders. Any assessment must acknowledge that he succeeded at the tasks assigned to him. He  revived French fortunes in India when Paris had conceived his tasks as essentially ones of armed transportation and privateering. That his achievement went beyond these duties despite a lack of support from his uncomprehending superiors and battle shy captains adds greatly to his credit and  perhaps explains his personal fury. Ironically, if anybody learned from his example, it was the British, who were confirmed in their longstanding policy of seeking outright victory in naval engagements. French military policy made naval operations subordinate to land operations, yet Suffren realized that in wars fought overseas from the mother country, the nation which controlled the sea first had a great advantage in supporting the land war:\n\n{{quote|The military situation... demanded first the disabling of the hostile fleet, next the capture of certain strategic ports. That this diagnosis was correct is as certain as that it reversed the common French maxims, which would have put the port first and the fleet second as objectives.<ref>Mahan, A.T., ''The Influence of Sea Power Upon History 1660\u20131783, p. 433 {{ISBN|0-486-25509-3}}</ref>}}\n\nSeven ships of the French Navy have been named ''Suffren'' in honour of Suffren de Saint Tropez.

Kirkbride appealed to Samuel for instructions. The political officer had a total force of only 50 Arab policemen at his disposal and quite simply did not know what to do. Several weeks later he received the following reply from Jerusalem: \u201cIt is considered most unlikely that the Emir Abdullah would advance into territory which is under British control... Two days later Abdullah\u2019s troops marched into British-controlled [[Moab]]. Unable to stop him, Kirkbride decided to welcome him instead. With Abdullah's arrival, the National Government of Moab went out of existence. Buoyed by his easy success, he decided to proceed to Amman. By the end of March 1921, Abdullah and his small army had effectively occupied most of Trans-Jordan unopposed... There seemed to be only two options. Either the British army had to be sent in to evict him or the French had to be allowed to cross the frontier to accomplish the task. Both courses of action were considered to be completely unacceptable. The government was simply not prepared to go to the expense of sending an army to fight in a territory of such marginal importance as Trans-Jordan, and it was equally inconceivable that British policy would permit French intervention and occupation of the area. There was, however, another alternative, which was suggested by Churchill. He observed that it was most important that the government of Trans-Jordan be compatible with that of Iraq because British strategy called for a direct overland link between Egypt and the Persian Gulf, which would have to cross both territories. Since in the meantime Feisal had been given the throne of Iraq, it might well serve British purposes to make his brother, Abdullah, ruler of Trans-Jordan or to appoint an indigenous leader approved by him.|isbn= 9780275966393}}</ref>\n\n===Relationship with Palestine===\n{{main|British Mandate for Palestine (legal instrument)}}\nIn early 1921, prior to the convening of the Cairo Conference, the Middle East Department of the [[Colonial Office]] set out the situation as follows:\n<blockquote>Distinction to be drawn between Palestine and Trans-Jordan under the Mandate. His Majesty's Government are responsible under the terms of the Mandate for establishing in Palestine a national home for the Jewish people. They are also pledged by the assurances given to the Sherif of Mecca in 1915 to recognise and support the independence of the Arabs in those portions of the (Turkish) vilayet of Damascus in which they are free to act without detriment to French interests. The western boundary of the Turkish vilayet of Damascus before the war was the River Jordan. Palestine and Trans-Jordan do not, therefore, stand upon quite the same footing. At the same time, the two areas are economically interdependent, and their development must be considered as a single problem. Further, His Majesty's Government have been entrusted with the Mandate for \"Palestine\". If they wish to assert their claim to Trans-Jordan and to avoid raising with other Powers the legal status of that area, they can only do so by proceeding upon the assumption that Trans-Jordan forms part of the area covered by the Palestine Mandate. In default of this assumption Trans-Jordan would be left, under article 132 of the [[Treaty of S\u00e8vres]], to the disposal of the principal Allied Powers. Some means must be found of giving effect in Trans-Jordan to the terms of the Mandate consistently with \"recognition and support of the independence of the Arabs\".<ref>[''Memorandum drawn up in London by Middle East Department Prior to Palestine Conference''].

With the mandates of Palestine and Iraq awarded to Britain, Churchill wished to consult with Middle East experts. At his request, [[Gertrude Bell]], Sir Percy Cox, T. E. Lawrence, Sir [[Kinahan Cornwallis]], Sir Arnold T. Wilson, Iraqi minister of war Ja\u02bffar alAskari, Iraqi minister of finance Sasun Effendi (Sasson Heskayl), and others gathered in Cairo, Egypt. An additional outstanding question was the policy to be adopted in Transjordan to prevent anti-French military actions from being launched within the allied British zone of influence. The Hashemites were Associated Powers during the war, and a peaceful solution was urgently needed. The two most significant decisions of the conference were to offer the throne of Iraq to emir Faisal ibn Hussein (who became [[Faisal I of Iraq]]) and an emirate of Transjordan (now Jordan) to his brother Abdullah ibn Hussein (who became [[Abdullah I of Jordan]]). The conference provided the political blueprint for British administration in both Iraq and Transjordan, and in offering these two regions to the sons of Hussein bin Ali, Churchill stated that the spirit, if not the letter, of Britain's wartime promises to the Arabs might be fulfilled. After further discussions between Churchill and Abdullah in Jerusalem, it was mutually agreed that Transjordan was accepted into the mandatory area as an Arab country apart from Palestine with the proviso that it would be, initially for six months, under the nominal rule of the emir Abdullah and that it would not form part of the [[Homeland for the Jewish people|Jewish national home]] to be established west of the River Jordan.<ref>Palestine Papers, 1917\u20131922, Doreen Ingrams, George Braziller 1973 Edition, pages 116\u2013117</ref><ref name=Lustick>{{Cite book|title=''For the Land and the Lord: Jewish Fundamentalism in Israel''|author=Ian Lustick|year=1988|publisher=Council on Foreign Relations|page=[https://archive.org/details/forlandlordjewis0000lust/page/37 37]|isbn=978-0-87609-036-7|url-access=registration|url=https://archive.org/details/forlandlordjewis0000lust/page/37}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |last1= Wilson|first1= Mary|title= King Abdullah, Britain and the Making of Jordan |url= https://books.google.com/?id=yUGYsBRpqPkC|accessdate= 26 February 2012|year= 1990|pages= 53|quote= Abdullah began by suggesting the unification of Palestine and Transjordan under an Arab ruler, or the unification of Transjordan and Iraq.

The government of the territory was, subject to the mandate, formed by Abdullah, brother of King Faisal I of Iraq, who had been at Amman since February 1921. Britain recognized Transjordan as an independent government on 15 May 1923, and gradually relinquished control, limiting its oversight to financial, military and foreign policy matters. This affected the goals of [[Revisionist Zionism]], which sought a state on both banks of the Jordan.

The southern region of [[Ma'an Governorate|Ma'an]]-[[Aqaba Governorate|Aqaba]], a large area with a small population of just 10,000,{{sfn|Wilson|1990|p=229 (footnote 70)}} was [[Occupation of Ma'an|administered by OETA East (later the Arab Kingdom of Syria, and then Mandatory Transjordan) and claimed by the Kingdom of Hejaz]].{{sfn|Leatherdale|1983|pp=41\u201342}}{{sfn|Baker|1979|p=220}} In OETA East, Faisal had appointed a [[kaymakam]] (or sub-governor) at Ma'an, whereas the kaymakam at Aqaba, who \"disregarded both Husein in Mecca and Feisal in Damascus with impunity\" had been instructed by Hussein to extend his authority to Ma'an.{{sfn|Leatherdale|1983|pp=41\u201342}} This technical dispute did not rise to any form of open struggle, and the Kingdom of Hejaz was to take de facto control after Faisal's administration was defeated by the French.{{efn|Baker explained that \"The British had moved in to take advantage of the situation created by Husain's presence in Aqaba and pressed for the annexation of the Hejaz Vilayet of Ma'an to the mandated territory of Transjordan. This disputed area, containing Maan, Aqaba and Petra, had originally been part of the Damascus Vilayet during Ottoman times, though boundaries had never been very precise. It was seized first by the Army as it pushed north from Aqaba after 1917 and had then been included in O.E.T.A. East and, later, in Faisal's kingdom of Syria. Husain, however, had never accepted this and had stationed a Vali alongside Faisal's administrator, but the two men had worked in harmony so that the dispute never came to an open struggle. After Faisal's exile, the French mandate boundary had excluded this area and the British then considered it to be part of the Syrian rump which became Transjordan, though nothing was done to realise that claim, so Hejaz administration held de facto control. Britain had, however, made its position clear in August 1924 when it cabled Bullard: \"Please inform King Hussein officially that H.M.G. cannot acquiesce in his claim to concern himself directly with the administration of any portion of the territory of Transjordan for which H.M.G. are responsible under the mandate for Palestine\"\"{{sfn|Baker|1979|p=220}}}} Following the 1924-25 [[Saudi conquest of Hejaz]], Hussein's army fled to the Ma'an region, which was then formally announced as annexed by Abdullah's Transjordan. Ibn Saud privately agreed to respect this position in an exchange of letters at the time of the [[Treaty of Jeddah (1927)|1927 Treaty of Jeddah]].{{sfn|Wilson|1990|p=100}}\n\nThe [[Negev]] region was added to Palestine on 10 July 1922, having been conceded by British representative John Philby \"in Trans-Jordan's name\".{{efn| Biger described this meeting as follows: \"Sovereignty over the Arava, from the south of the Dead Sea to Aqaba, was also discussed. Philby agreed, in Trans-Jordan's name, to give up the western bank of Wadi Arava (and thus all of the Negev area). Nevertheless, a precise borderline was still not determined along the territories of Palestine and Trans-Jordan. Philby's relinquishment of the Negev was necessary, because the future of this area was uncertain. In a discussion regarding the southern boundary, the Egyptian aspiration to acquire the Negev area was presented. On the other hand the southern part of Palestine belonged, according to one of the versions, to the sanjak (district) of Ma'an within the vilayet (province) of Hejaz. King Hussein of Hijaz demanded to receive this area after claiming that a transfer action, to add it to the vilayet of Syria (A-Sham) was supposed to be done in 1908. It is not clear whether this action was completed. Philby claimed that Emir Abdullah had his father's permission to negotiate over the future of the sanjak of Ma'an, which was actually ruled by him, and that he could therefore 'afford to concede' the area west of the Arava in favour of Palestine. This concession was made following British pressure and against the background of the demands of the Zionist Organization for direct contact between Palestine and the Red Sea. It led to the inclusion of the Negev triangle in Palestine's territory, although this area was not considered as part of the country in the many centuries that preceded the British occupation.\"{{sfn|Biger|2004|p=181; Biger references 10 July 1922 meeting notes, file 2.179, CZA}}}} Abdullah made a request for the Negev to be added to Transjordan in late 1922, and again in 1925, but this was rejected.{{sfn|Biger|2004|p=184}}\n\nThe location of the Eastern border between Transjordan and Iraq was considered strategic with respect to the proposed construction of what became the [[Kirkuk\u2013Haifa oil pipeline]].{{sfn|Wilson|1990|p=100}} It was first set out on 2 December 1922, in a treaty to which Transjordan was not party to \u2013 the [[Uqair Protocol of 1922|Uqair Protocol]] between Iraq and Nejd.{{sfn|Amadouny|2012|p=132-133}} It described the western end of the Iraq-Nejd boundary as \"the Jebel Anazan situated in the neighbourhood of the intersection of latitude [[32nd parallel north|32 degrees north]] longitude [[39th meridian east|39 degrees east]] where the Iraq-Najd boundary terminated\", thereby implicitly confirming this as the point at which the Iraq-Nejd boundary became the Transjordan-Nejd boundary.{{sfn|Amadouny|2012|p=132-133}} This followed a proposal from Lawrence in January 1922 that Transjordan be extended to include [[Wadi Sirhan]] as far south as [[Dumat al-Jandal|al-Jauf]], in order to protect Britain's route to India and contain Ibn Saud.{{sfn|Amadouny|2012|p=132-133; Amadouny cites Lawrence, 'Transjordan-Extension of Territory', 5 January 1922, CO 733 33}}\n\nFrance transferred the District of Ramtha from Syria in 1921.<ref>{{cite book|author=Michael R.

He dissolved the local governments formed by the British and established three administrative provinces (liwa\u2019): cAjlun, Balqa\u2019 and Karak. On 11 April 1921 he formed his first government. The newly appointed central administration was mainly staffed by Arab nationalist exiles. The first government was composed of four Syrians, a Palestinian, a Hijazi and only one native Transjordanian. The British offered financial assistance, administrative guidance and military support from Palestine upon request and maintained a watchful position. The sole organised and effective military force at hand was a Hijazi household army of some 200 men under Hashemite command. Peake's Reserve Force was still under construction and dysfunctional. (pg 40); From early 1922 until the autumn of 1923 the country enjoyed a period of stability during which the central administration succeeded in asserting its authority over the settled population. A change of personalities, resulting in more sympathetic British Representatives, Abdullah's recognition of his precarious situation, and an improved attitude of the Palestine government towards the independent administration of the country, contributed to the stabilisation of Transjordan and the subjugation of the settled tribes to the government's authority. More importantly, the resurrection of the Reserve Force, later renamed the Arab Legion, allowed for this success. (pg 49); Thus, in the summer of 1922, the government managed to gain the submission of the settled and semi-settled tribes. Peake and Philby reported on the satisfactory collection of taxes and good public order.45 Macan Abu Nowar asserts that, as early as August 1922, Abdullah could already point to several achievements in the process of state-building. His government maintained law and order, improved tax-collection, opened new schools and clinics, built roads, established telegraph and post office services and created sharci and civil courts.

Assisted by the British and the famous Lawrence of Arabia (T. E. Lawrence), Sharif Hussein of Mecca led this successful revolt, which contributed to the Ottoman defeat in World War I and to the eventual establishment of the various Arab states. Jordan originally fell under the rule of King Faisal, son of Sharif Hussein and the principal military leader of the Arab Revolt. Jordanians, along with their Arab brothers from other regions, served in the new Arab government and sat in its parliament. After King Faisal was forced from the throne in July 1920 by the French military, the British high commissioner of Palestine, Sir Herbert Samuel, went to the town of Salt in Transjordan and declared that the territory, as had been secretly agreed by the British and French in the Sykes-Picot Agreement during World War I, was part of the British Mandatory Palestine. Amir (Prince) Abdullah, a younger son of Sharif Hussein, arrived in Jordan in the fall of 1920 with the intent of regaining Damascus for his Hashemite family. Because he had gained a following, the British decided to recognise his leadership in that territory and provide him with a subsidy in exchange for his not pursuing his original Damascus intentions. This arrangement was confirmed in a 27 March 1921, meeting between then colonial secretary, Winston Churchill, and Amir Abdullah. In addition, Jordan was officially removed from Britain's Palestine mandate and given a mandate status of its own. Between the two world wars, Amir Abdullah, with considerable assistance from Britain, established Hashemite authority in Jordan, basing his rule in the new capital of Amman.\"{{sfn|Gubser|1991|p= 45\u201346}}}}\n\nDuring the eleventh session of the [[League of Nations]]' [[Permanent Mandates Commission]] in 1927, Sir John Shuckburgh summarised the status of Transjordan:\n<blockquote>It is not part of Palestine but it is part of the area administered by the British Government under the authority of the Palestine Mandate. The special arrangements there really go back to the old controversy about our war time pledges to the Arabs which I have no wish to revive. The point is that on our own interpretation of those pledges the country East of the Jordan \u2013 though not the country West of the Jordan \u2013 falls within the area in respect of which we promised during the war to recognise and support the independence of the Arabs.

Several weeks later he received the following reply from Jerusalem: \u201cIt is considered most unlikely that the Emir Abdullah would advance into territory which is under British control... Two days later Abdullah\u2019s troops marched into British-controlled [[Moab]]. Unable to stop him, Kirkbride decided to welcome him instead.

Both courses of action were considered to be completely unacceptable. The government was simply not prepared to go to the expense of sending an army to fight in a territory of such marginal importance as Trans-Jordan, and it was equally inconceivable that British policy would permit French intervention and occupation of the area. There was, however, another alternative, which was suggested by Churchill. He observed that it was most important that the government of Trans-Jordan be compatible with that of Iraq because British strategy called for a direct overland link between Egypt and the Persian Gulf, which would have to cross both territories. Since in the meantime Feisal had been given the throne of Iraq, it might well serve British purposes to make his brother, Abdullah, ruler of Trans-Jordan or to appoint an indigenous leader approved by him.|isbn= 9780275966393}}</ref>\n\n===Relationship with Palestine===\n{{main|British Mandate for Palestine (legal instrument)}}\nIn early 1921, prior to the convening of the Cairo Conference, the Middle East Department of the [[Colonial Office]] set out the situation as follows:\n<blockquote>Distinction to be drawn between Palestine and Trans-Jordan under the Mandate. His Majesty's Government are responsible under the terms of the Mandate for establishing in Palestine a national home for the Jewish people. They are also pledged by the assurances given to the Sherif of Mecca in 1915 to recognise and support the independence of the Arabs in those portions of the (Turkish) vilayet of Damascus in which they are free to act without detriment to French interests. The western boundary of the Turkish vilayet of Damascus before the war was the River Jordan. Palestine and Trans-Jordan do not, therefore, stand upon quite the same footing. At the same time, the two areas are economically interdependent, and their development must be considered as a single problem. Further, His Majesty's Government have been entrusted with the Mandate for \"Palestine\". If they wish to assert their claim to Trans-Jordan and to avoid raising with other Powers the legal status of that area, they can only do so by proceeding upon the assumption that Trans-Jordan forms part of the area covered by the Palestine Mandate. In default of this assumption Trans-Jordan would be left, under article 132 of the [[Treaty of S\u00e8vres]], to the disposal of the principal Allied Powers. Some means must be found of giving effect in Trans-Jordan to the terms of the Mandate consistently with \"recognition and support of the independence of the Arabs\".<ref>[''Memorandum drawn up in London by Middle East Department Prior to Palestine Conference''].

With the mandates of Palestine and Iraq awarded to Britain, Churchill wished to consult with Middle East experts. At his request, [[Gertrude Bell]], Sir Percy Cox, T. E. Lawrence, Sir [[Kinahan Cornwallis]], Sir Arnold T. Wilson, Iraqi minister of war Ja\u02bffar alAskari, Iraqi minister of finance Sasun Effendi (Sasson Heskayl), and others gathered in Cairo, Egypt. An additional outstanding question was the policy to be adopted in Transjordan to prevent anti-French military actions from being launched within the allied British zone of influence. The Hashemites were Associated Powers during the war, and a peaceful solution was urgently needed. The two most significant decisions of the conference were to offer the throne of Iraq to emir Faisal ibn Hussein (who became [[Faisal I of Iraq]]) and an emirate of Transjordan (now Jordan) to his brother Abdullah ibn Hussein (who became [[Abdullah I of Jordan]]). The conference provided the political blueprint for British administration in both Iraq and Transjordan, and in offering these two regions to the sons of Hussein bin Ali, Churchill stated that the spirit, if not the letter, of Britain's wartime promises to the Arabs might be fulfilled. After further discussions between Churchill and Abdullah in Jerusalem, it was mutually agreed that Transjordan was accepted into the mandatory area as an Arab country apart from Palestine with the proviso that it would be, initially for six months, under the nominal rule of the emir Abdullah and that it would not form part of the [[Homeland for the Jewish people|Jewish national home]] to be established west of the River Jordan.<ref>Palestine Papers, 1917\u20131922, Doreen Ingrams, George Braziller 1973 Edition, pages 116\u2013117</ref><ref name=Lustick>{{Cite book|title=''For the Land and the Lord: Jewish Fundamentalism in Israel''|author=Ian Lustick|year=1988|publisher=Council on Foreign Relations|page=[https://archive.org/details/forlandlordjewis0000lust/page/37 37]|isbn=978-0-87609-036-7|url-access=registration|url=https://archive.org/details/forlandlordjewis0000lust/page/37}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |last1= Wilson|first1= Mary|title= King Abdullah, Britain and the Making of Jordan |url= https://books.google.com/?id=yUGYsBRpqPkC|accessdate= 26 February 2012|year= 1990|pages= 53|quote= Abdullah began by suggesting the unification of Palestine and Transjordan under an Arab ruler, or the unification of Transjordan and Iraq.

The government of the territory was, subject to the mandate, formed by Abdullah, brother of King Faisal I of Iraq, who had been at Amman since February 1921. Britain recognized Transjordan as an independent government on 15 May 1923, and gradually relinquished control, limiting its oversight to financial, military and foreign policy matters. This affected the goals of [[Revisionist Zionism]], which sought a state on both banks of the Jordan. The movement claimed that it effectively severed Transjordan from Palestine, and so reduced the area on which a future Jewish state in the region could be established.{{sfn|Wasserstein|2008}}<ref name=\"MakingofJordan\">{{cite web|url=http://www.kinghussein.gov.jo/his_transjordan.html|title=Jordan \u2013 History \u2013 The Making of Transjordan|first=Business Optimization Consultants|last=B.O.C.|publisher=}}</ref>\n\n===Borders===\nThe southern border between Transjordan and Arabia was considered strategic for Transjordan in order to avoid being [[Landlocked country|landlocked]], with intended access to the sea via the [[Port of Aqaba]]. The southern region of [[Ma'an Governorate|Ma'an]]-[[Aqaba Governorate|Aqaba]], a large area with a small population of just 10,000,{{sfn|Wilson|1990|p=229 (footnote 70)}} was [[Occupation of Ma'an|administered by OETA East (later the Arab Kingdom of Syria, and then Mandatory Transjordan) and claimed by the Kingdom of Hejaz]].{{sfn|Leatherdale|1983|pp=41\u201342}}{{sfn|Baker|1979|p=220}} In OETA East, Faisal had appointed a [[kaymakam]] (or sub-governor) at Ma'an, whereas the kaymakam at Aqaba, who \"disregarded both Husein in Mecca and Feisal in Damascus with impunity\" had been instructed by Hussein to extend his authority to Ma'an.{{sfn|Leatherdale|1983|pp=41\u201342}} This technical dispute did not rise to any form of open struggle, and the Kingdom of Hejaz was to take de facto control after Faisal's administration was defeated by the French.{{efn|Baker explained that \"The British had moved in to take advantage of the situation created by Husain's presence in Aqaba and pressed for the annexation of the Hejaz Vilayet of Ma'an to the mandated territory of Transjordan. This disputed area, containing Maan, Aqaba and Petra, had originally been part of the Damascus Vilayet during Ottoman times, though boundaries had never been very precise. It was seized first by the Army as it pushed north from Aqaba after 1917 and had then been included in O.E.T.A. East and, later, in Faisal's kingdom of Syria. Husain, however, had never accepted this and had stationed a Vali alongside Faisal's administrator, but the two men had worked in harmony so that the dispute never came to an open struggle. After Faisal's exile, the French mandate boundary had excluded this area and the British then considered it to be part of the Syrian rump which became Transjordan, though nothing was done to realise that claim, so Hejaz administration held de facto control. Britain had, however, made its position clear in August 1924 when it cabled Bullard: \"Please inform King Hussein officially that H.M.G. cannot acquiesce in his claim to concern himself directly with the administration of any portion of the territory of Transjordan for which H.M.G. are responsible under the mandate for Palestine\"\"{{sfn|Baker|1979|p=220}}}} Following the 1924-25 [[Saudi conquest of Hejaz]], Hussein's army fled to the Ma'an region, which was then formally announced as annexed by Abdullah's Transjordan. Ibn Saud privately agreed to respect this position in an exchange of letters at the time of the [[Treaty of Jeddah (1927)|1927 Treaty of Jeddah]].{{sfn|Wilson|1990|p=100}}\n\nThe [[Negev]] region was added to Palestine on 10 July 1922, having been conceded by British representative John Philby \"in Trans-Jordan's name\".{{efn| Biger described this meeting as follows: \"Sovereignty over the Arava, from the south of the Dead Sea to Aqaba, was also discussed. Philby agreed, in Trans-Jordan's name, to give up the western bank of Wadi Arava (and thus all of the Negev area). Nevertheless, a precise borderline was still not determined along the territories of Palestine and Trans-Jordan. Philby's relinquishment of the Negev was necessary, because the future of this area was uncertain. In a discussion regarding the southern boundary, the Egyptian aspiration to acquire the Negev area was presented. On the other hand the southern part of Palestine belonged, according to one of the versions, to the sanjak (district) of Ma'an within the vilayet (province) of Hejaz. King Hussein of Hijaz demanded to receive this area after claiming that a transfer action, to add it to the vilayet of Syria (A-Sham) was supposed to be done in 1908. It is not clear whether this action was completed. Philby claimed that Emir Abdullah had his father's permission to negotiate over the future of the sanjak of Ma'an, which was actually ruled by him, and that he could therefore 'afford to concede' the area west of the Arava in favour of Palestine. This concession was made following British pressure and against the background of the demands of the Zionist Organization for direct contact between Palestine and the Red Sea. It led to the inclusion of the Negev triangle in Palestine's territory, although this area was not considered as part of the country in the many centuries that preceded the British occupation.\"{{sfn|Biger|2004|p=181; Biger references 10 July 1922 meeting notes, file 2.179, CZA}}}} Abdullah made a request for the Negev to be added to Transjordan in late 1922, and again in 1925, but this was rejected.{{sfn|Biger|2004|p=184}}\n\nThe location of the Eastern border between Transjordan and Iraq was considered strategic with respect to the proposed construction of what became the [[Kirkuk\u2013Haifa oil pipeline]].{{sfn|Wilson|1990|p=100}} It was first set out on 2 December 1922, in a treaty to which Transjordan was not party to \u2013 the [[Uqair Protocol of 1922|Uqair Protocol]] between Iraq and Nejd.{{sfn|Amadouny|2012|p=132-133}} It described the western end of the Iraq-Nejd boundary as \"the Jebel Anazan situated in the neighbourhood of the intersection of latitude [[32nd parallel north|32 degrees north]] longitude [[39th meridian east|39 degrees east]] where the Iraq-Najd boundary terminated\", thereby implicitly confirming this as the point at which the Iraq-Nejd boundary became the Transjordan-Nejd boundary.{{sfn|Amadouny|2012|p=132-133}} This followed a proposal from Lawrence in January 1922 that Transjordan be extended to include [[Wadi Sirhan]] as far south as [[Dumat al-Jandal|al-Jauf]], in order to protect Britain's route to India and contain Ibn Saud.{{sfn|Amadouny|2012|p=132-133; Amadouny cites Lawrence, 'Transjordan-Extension of Territory', 5 January 1922, CO 733 33}}\n\nFrance transferred the District of Ramtha from Syria in 1921.<ref>{{cite book|author=Michael R.

He dissolved the local governments formed by the British and established three administrative provinces (liwa\u2019): cAjlun, Balqa\u2019 and Karak. On 11 April 1921 he formed his first government. The newly appointed central administration was mainly staffed by Arab nationalist exiles. The first government was composed of four Syrians, a Palestinian, a Hijazi and only one native Transjordanian. The British offered financial assistance, administrative guidance and military support from Palestine upon request and maintained a watchful position. The sole organised and effective military force at hand was a Hijazi household army of some 200 men under Hashemite command. Peake's Reserve Force was still under construction and dysfunctional. (pg 40); From early 1922 until the autumn of 1923 the country enjoyed a period of stability during which the central administration succeeded in asserting its authority over the settled population. A change of personalities, resulting in more sympathetic British Representatives, Abdullah's recognition of his precarious situation, and an improved attitude of the Palestine government towards the independent administration of the country, contributed to the stabilisation of Transjordan and the subjugation of the settled tribes to the government's authority. More importantly, the resurrection of the Reserve Force, later renamed the Arab Legion, allowed for this success. (pg 49); Thus, in the summer of 1922, the government managed to gain the submission of the settled and semi-settled tribes.

Assisted by the British and the famous Lawrence of Arabia (T. E. Lawrence), Sharif Hussein of Mecca led this successful revolt, which contributed to the Ottoman defeat in World War I and to the eventual establishment of the various Arab states. Jordan originally fell under the rule of King Faisal, son of Sharif Hussein and the principal military leader of the Arab Revolt. Jordanians, along with their Arab brothers from other regions, served in the new Arab government and sat in its parliament. After King Faisal was forced from the throne in July 1920 by the French military, the British high commissioner of Palestine, Sir Herbert Samuel, went to the town of Salt in Transjordan and declared that the territory, as had been secretly agreed by the British and French in the Sykes-Picot Agreement during World War I, was part of the British Mandatory Palestine. Amir (Prince) Abdullah, a younger son of Sharif Hussein, arrived in Jordan in the fall of 1920 with the intent of regaining Damascus for his Hashemite family. Because he had gained a following, the British decided to recognise his leadership in that territory and provide him with a subsidy in exchange for his not pursuing his original Damascus intentions. This arrangement was confirmed in a 27 March 1921, meeting between then colonial secretary, Winston Churchill, and Amir Abdullah. In addition, Jordan was officially removed from Britain's Palestine mandate and given a mandate status of its own. Between the two world wars, Amir Abdullah, with considerable assistance from Britain, established Hashemite authority in Jordan, basing his rule in the new capital of Amman.\"{{sfn|Gubser|1991|p= 45\u201346}}}}\n\nDuring the eleventh session of the [[League of Nations]]' [[Permanent Mandates Commission]] in 1927, Sir John Shuckburgh summarised the status of Transjordan:\n<blockquote>It is not part of Palestine but it is part of the area administered by the British Government under the authority of the Palestine Mandate. The special arrangements there really go back to the old controversy about our war time pledges to the Arabs which I have no wish to revive. The point is that on our own interpretation of those pledges the country East of the Jordan \u2013 though not the country West of the Jordan \u2013 falls within the area in respect of which we promised during the war to recognise and support the independence of the Arabs.

It was further provided in the application of the Mandate to Transjordan that the action which in Palestine is taken by the Administration of Palestine will be taken by the Administration of Transjordan under the general supervision of the Mandatory.

W. Norton 3rd Ed, 2009 {{ISBN|978-0393196566}}</ref> Each layer can be as thin as a sheet of paper, or over a meter in thickness.<ref name=EG/> The word comes from the Latin ''folium'', meaning \"leaf\", and refers to the sheet-like planar structure.<ref name=EG/> It is caused by [[shearing forces]] (pressures pushing different sections of the rock in different directions), or [[differential pressure]] (higher pressure from one direction than in others). The layers form parallel to the direction of the shear, or perpendicular to the direction of higher pressure. Nonfoliated [[metamorphic rock]]s are typically formed in the absence of significant differential pressure or shear.<ref name = EG/> Foliation is common in rocks affected by the regional [[metamorphism|metamorphic]] compression typical of areas of mountain belt formation ([[orogeny|orogenic belts]]).  \n\nMore technically, foliation is any penetrative planar [[Fabric (geology)|fabric]] present in metamorphic rocks. Rocks exhibiting foliation include the standard sequence formed by the [[Metamorphism#Prograde_and_retrograde_metamorphism|prograde metamorphism]] of [[mudrock]]s; [[slate]], [[phyllite]], [[schist]] and [[gneiss]]. The ''slatey [[Cleavage (geology)|cleavage]]'' typical of slate is due to the preferred orientation of microscopic [[phyllosilicate]] [[crystal]]s. In gneiss, the foliation is more typically represented by compositional banding due to segregation of mineral phases. Foliated rock is also known as [[Tectonite|S-tectonite]] in [[Shear (geology)|sheared]] rock masses. \n\nExamples include the bands in [[gneiss]] (gneissic banding), a preferred orientation of planar ''large'' mica flakes in [[schist]] (schistosity), the preferred orientation of ''small'' mica flakes in [[phyllite]] (with its planes having a silky sheen, called ''phylitic luster'' \u2013 the Greek word, ''phyllon'', also means \"leaf\"), the extremely fine grained preferred orientation of clay flakes in [[slate]] (called \"[[slaty cleavage]]\"), and the layers of flattened, smeared, pancake-like [[clasts]] in [[metaconglomerate]].<ref name=EG/>\n\n==Formation mechanisms==\nFoliation is usually formed by the preferred orientation of [[mineral]]s within a rock.  \n\nUsually, this is a result of some physical force and its effect on the growth of minerals. The planar fabric of a foliation typically forms at [[right angle]]s to the maximum principal stress direction. In [[Shear (geology)|sheared zone]]s, however, planar fabric within a rock may not be directly perpendicular to the principal stress direction due to rotation, mass transport, and shortening. \n\nFoliation may be formed by realignment of [[mica]]s and [[Clay mineral|clay]]s via physical rotation of the minerals within the rock. Often this foliation is associated with [[diagenesis|diagenetic]] metamorphism and low-grade burial metamorphism. Foliation may parallel original sedimentary bedding, but more often is oriented at some angle to it.\n\nThe growth of platy minerals, typically of the mica group, is usually a result of [[Metamorphism#Prograde and retrograde metamorphism|prograde metamorphic]] reactions during deformation. Often, [[retrograde metamorphism]] will not form a foliation because the unroofing of a metamorphic belt is not accompanied by significant compressive stress. Thermal metamorphism in the [[Metamorphism#Contact (thermal) metamorphism|aureole]] of a [[granite]] is also unlikely to result in the growth of mica in a foliation, although the growth of new minerals may overprint existing foliation(s).\n\nAlignment of tabular minerals in [[metamorphic rock]]s, [[igneous rock]]s and [[intrusive rock]]s may form a foliation. Typical examples of metamorphic rocks include [[porphyroblast]]ic schists where large, oblate minerals form an alignment either due to growth or rotation in the groundmass. \n\nIgneous rocks can become [https://www.draughtsmancivilnotes.in/2020/04/classification-of-rocks.html foliated rock] by alignment of [[Cumulate rock|cumulate crystal]]s during [[convection]] in large [[magma chamber]]s, especially [[ultramafic]] intrusions, and typically [[plagioclase]] [[lath]]s. Granite may form foliation due to frictional drag on [[viscous]] magma by the wall rocks. Lavas may preserve a flow foliation, or even compressed [[eutaxitic]] texture, typically in highly viscous [[felsic]] [[agglomerate]], [[Tuff#Welded tuff|welded tuff]] and [[pyroclastic]] surge deposits. \n\nMetamorphic differentiation, typical of [[gneiss]]es, is caused by chemical and compositional banding within the metamorphic rock mass. Usually, this represents the [[protolith]] chemistry, which forms distinct mineral assemblages. However, compositional banding can be the result of [[nucleation]] processes which cause chemical and mineralogical differentiation into bands. This typically follows the same principle as mica growth, perpendicular to the principal stress.\nMetamorphic differentiation can be present at angles to protolith compositional banding. \n\n''[[Crenulation]] cleavage'' and ''[[oblique foliation]]'' are particular types of foliation.\n\n==Interpretation==\nFoliation, as it forms generally perpendicular to the direction of principal stress, records the direction of shortening. This is related to the axis of folds, which generally form an ''axial-planar'' foliation within their axial regions. \n\nMeasurement of the intersection between a fold's axial plane and a surface on the fold will provide the [[fold plunge]]. If a foliation does not match the observed plunge of a fold, it is likely associated with a different deformation event.\n\nFoliation in areas of shearing, and within the plane of [[thrust fault]]s, can provide information on the transport direction or sense of movement on the thrust or shear. Generally, the acute intersection angle shows the direction of transport. Foliations typically bend or curve into a shear, which provides the same information, if it is of a scale which can be observed.\n\nFoliations, in a regional sense, will tend to curve around rigid, incompressible bodies such as granite. Thus, they are not always 'planar' in the strictest sense and may violate the rule of being perpendicular to the regional stress field, due to local influences. This is a megascopic version of what may occur around porphyroblasts. Often, fine observation of foliations on outcrop, hand specimen and on the microscopic scale complements observations on a map or regional scale.  \n<!-- Someone need to expand on intersection lineations; Rolinator -->\n\n==Description==\nWhen describing a foliation it is useful to note\n* the mineralogy of the folia; this can provide information on the conditions of formation\n* the mineralogy in intrafolial areas \n* foliation spacing\n* any [[porphyroblasts]] or minerals associated with the foliation and whether they overprint it or are cut by it\n* whether it is planar, undulose, vague or well developed\n* its orientation in space, as strike and dip, or dip and dip direction\n* its relationship to other foliations, to bedding and any folding\n* measure [[intersection lineation]]s \n\nFollowing such a methodology allows eventual correlations in style, metamorphic grade, and intensity throughout a region, relationship to [[Fault (geology)|faults]], [[Shear (geology)|shears]], structures and mineral assemblages.\n\n==Engineering considerations==\nIn [[geotechnical engineering]] a foliation plane may form a [[Discontinuity (Geotechnical engineering)|discontinuity]] that may have a large influence on the mechanical behavior (strength, deformation, etc.) of rock masses in, for example, [[tunnel]], [[Foundation (engineering)|foundation]], or [[Slope stability analysis|slope]] construction.\n\n==See also==\n{{Div col|small=yes}}\n* [[Cleavage (geology)]]\n* [[Discontinuity (geotechnical engineering)]]\n* [[Exfoliating granite]]\n* [[Fissility (geology)]]\n* [[Fold (geology)]]\n* [[List of rock textures]]\n* [[List of rock types]]\n* [[Rock microstructure]]\n* [[Shear (geology)]]\n{{Div col end}}\n\n==References==\n\n<references />\n* Blatt, Harvey and Tracy, Robert J.; 1996, ''Petrology: Igneous, Sedimentary, and Metamorphic'', 2nd ed., p. 359-360, W.

Rocks exhibiting foliation include the standard sequence formed by the [[Metamorphism#Prograde_and_retrograde_metamorphism|prograde metamorphism]] of [[mudrock]]s; [[slate]], [[phyllite]], [[schist]] and [[gneiss]].

The planar fabric of a foliation typically forms at [[right angle]]s to the maximum principal stress direction. In [[Shear (geology)|sheared zone]]s, however, planar fabric within a rock may not be directly perpendicular to the principal stress direction due to rotation, mass transport, and shortening. \n\nFoliation may be formed by realignment of [[mica]]s and [[Clay mineral|clay]]s via physical rotation of the minerals within the rock. Often this foliation is associated with [[diagenesis|diagenetic]] metamorphism and low-grade burial metamorphism.

Basalt commonly features a very fine-grained or [[volcanic glass|glassy]] matrix interspersed with visible mineral grains. The average density is 3.0 g/cm<sup>3</sup>.\n\n[https://www.draughtsmancivilnotes.in/2020/04/classification-of-rocks.html Basalt] is defined by its mineral content and [[Igneous textures|texture]], and physical descriptions without mineralogical context may be unreliable in some circumstances. Basalt is usually grey to black in colour, but rapidly weathers to brown or rust-red due to oxidation of its [[mafic]] (iron-rich) minerals into [[hematite]] and other iron oxides and hydroxides. Although usually characterized as \"dark\", basaltic rocks exhibit a wide range of shading due to regional geochemical processes. Due to weathering or high concentrations of plagioclase, some basalts can be quite light-coloured, superficially resembling [[andesite]] to untrained eyes. Basalt has a [[fine-grained]] mineral texture due to the molten rock cooling too quickly for large mineral crystals to grow; it is often [[porphyritic]], containing larger crystals ([[phenocryst]]s) formed prior to the extrusion that brought the magma to the surface, embedded in a finer-grained [[Matrix (geology)|matrix]].  These phenocrysts usually are of [[olivine]] or a calcium-rich plagioclase, which have the highest melting temperatures of the typical [[mineral]]s that can crystallize from the melt.\n\nBasalt with a [[vesicular texture]] is called vesicular basalt, when the bulk of the rock is mostly solid; when the vesicles are over half the volume of a specimen, it is called [[scoria]].  This texture forms when dissolved gases come out of solution and form bubbles as the magma decompresses as it reaches the surface, yet are trapped as the erupted lava hardens before the gases can escape.\n\nThe term basalt is at times applied to shallow [[intrusive rock]]s with a composition typical of basalt, but rocks of this composition with a [[phaneritic]] (coarser) groundmass are generally referred to as [[diabase]] (also called dolerite) or, when more coarse-grained (crystals over 2&nbsp;mm across), as [[gabbro]].  Gabbro is often marketed commercially as \"black granite.\"\n[[File:Szentgy\u00f6rgyhegy03.jpg|thumb|upright|Columnar basalt at Szent Gy\u00f6rgy Hill, Hungary]]\n[[File:VessicularBasalt1.JPG|thumb|Vesicular basalt at [[Sunset Crater]], Arizona. [[US quarter]] for scale.]]\n\nIn the [[Hadean]], [[Archean]], and early [[Proterozoic]] eras of Earth's history, the chemistry of erupted magmas was significantly different from today's, due to immature crustal and [[asthenosphere]] differentiation.  These [[Ultramafic rock|ultramafic]] volcanic rocks, with silica (SiO<sub>2</sub>) contents below 45% are usually classified as [[komatiite]]s.\n\n=== Etymology ===\nThe word \"basalt\" is ultimately derived from [[Late Latin]] ''basaltes'', a misspelling of Latin ''basanites'' \"very hard stone\", which was imported from [[Ancient Greek]] \u03b2\u03b1\u03c3\u03b1\u03bd\u03af\u03c4\u03b7\u03c2 (''basanites''), from \u03b2\u03ac\u03c3\u03b1\u03bd\u03bf\u03c2 (''basanos'', \"[[touchstone (assaying tool)|touchstone]]\") and perhaps originated in [[Egyptian language|Egyptian]] ''bauhun'' \"slate\".<ref>{{cite encyclopedia|title=basalt (n.) |encyclopedia=Online Etymology Dictionary |first=Douglas |last=Harper |url=http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=basalt |accessdate=4 November 2015}}</ref> The modern petrological term ''basalt'' describing a particular composition of lava-derived rock originates from its use by [[Georgius Agricola]] in 1556 in his famous work of mining and mineralogy ''[[De re metallica]], libri XII''.

[[Olivine]] can also be a significant constituent. Accessory [[mineral]]s present in relatively minor amounts include [[iron oxide]]s and iron-titanium oxides, such as [[magnetite]], [[ulv\u00f6spinel]], and [[ilmenite]]. Because of the presence of such [[oxide]] minerals, basalt can acquire strong [[magnetism|magnetic]] signatures as it cools, and [[paleomagnetism|paleomagnetic]] studies have made extensive use of basalt.\n\nIn [[tholeiitic basalt]], pyroxene ([[augite]] and [[orthopyroxene]] or [[pigeonite]]) and [[calcium]]-rich plagioclase are common [[phenocryst]] minerals. Olivine may also be a phenocryst, and when present, may have rims of pigeonite.  The [[groundmass]] contains interstitial [[quartz]] or [[tridymite]] or [[cristobalite]]. ''Olivine tholeiitic basalt'' has augite and orthopyroxene or pigeonite with abundant olivine, but olivine may have rims of pyroxene and is unlikely to be present in the [[matrix (geology)|groundmass]]. Ocean floor basalts, erupted originally at mid-ocean ridges, are known as MORB (mid-ocean ridge basalt) and are characteristically low in incompatible elements.\n\n[[Alkali basalt]]s typically have mineral assemblages that lack orthopyroxene but contain olivine. Feldspar phenocrysts typically are [[labradorite]] to [[andesine]] in composition. Augite is rich in titanium compared to augite in tholeiitic basalt. Minerals such as [[feldspar|alkali feldspar]], [[leucite]], [[nepheline]], [[sodalite]], [[phlogopite]] mica, and [[apatite]] may be present in the groundmass.\n\nBasalt has high [[liquidus]] and [[Solidus (chemistry)|solidus]] temperatures\u2014values at the Earth's surface are near or above 1200&nbsp;\u00b0C (liquidus) and near or below 1000&nbsp;\u00b0C (solidus); these values are higher than those of other common [[igneous rock]]s.\n\nThe majority of tholeiitic basalts are formed at approximately 50\u2013100&nbsp;km depth within the mantle. Many alkali basalts may be formed at greater depths, perhaps as deep as 150\u2013200&nbsp;km.<ref>{{Cite book|chapter-url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/book/9780750633864|title=Plate Tectonics and Crustal Evolution|last=Condie|first=Kent C.|publisher=Butterworth-Heinemann / Elsevier|year=1997|isbn=978-0-7506-3386-4|location=|pages=69|chapter=Chapter 3: \"Tectonic settings\"}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal|last=KUSHIRO|first=Ikuo|date=2007|title=Origin of magmas in subduction zones: a review of experimental studies|url=https://www.jstage.jst.go.jp/article/pjab/83/1/83_1_1/_pdf/-char/en|journal=Proceedings of the Japan Academy, Series B|language=en|volume=83|issue=1|pages=1\u201315|doi=10.2183/pjab.83.1|pmid=24019580|pmc=3756732|issn=0386-2208|bibcode=2007PJAB...83....1K}}</ref> The origin of high-alumina basalt continues to be controversial, with disagreement over whether it is a [[magma|primary melt]] or derived from other basalt types by fractionation.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Ozerov|first1=Alexei Y|title=The evolution of high-alumina basalts of the Klyuchevskoy volcano, Kamchatka, Russia, based on microprobe analyses of mineral inclusions|journal=Journal of Volcanology and Geothermal Research|date=January 2000|volume=95|issue=1\u20134|pages=65\u201379|doi=10.1016/S0377-0273(99)00118-3|bibcode=2000JVGR...95...65O|url=http://repo.kscnet.ru/2569/1/my_2000_f_en_JVGR.pdf}}</ref>{{rp|65}}\n\n=== Geochemistry ===\nRelative to most common [[igneous rock]]s, basalt compositions are rich in [[magnesium oxide|MgO]] and [[calcium oxide|CaO]] and low in [[silicon dioxide|SiO<sub>2</sub>]] and the alkali oxides, i.e., [[sodium oxide|Na<sub>2</sub>O]] + [[potassium oxide|K<sub>2</sub>O]], consistent with the [[TAS classification]].\n\nBasalt generally has a composition of 45\u201355 wt% SiO<sub>2</sub>, 2\u20136 wt% total alkalis, 0.5\u20132.0 wt% [[titanium dioxide|TiO<sub>2</sub>]], 5\u201314 wt% [[iron(II) oxide|FeO]] and 14 wt% or more [[alumina|Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>]]. Contents of CaO are commonly near 10 wt%, those of MgO commonly in the range 5 to 12 wt%.\n\nHigh-alumina basalts have aluminium contents of 17\u201319 wt% Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>; [[boninite]]s have [[magnesium]] (MgO) contents of up to 15 percent. Rare [[feldspathoid]]-rich [[mafic]] rocks, akin to alkali basalts, may have Na<sub>2</sub>O + K<sub>2</sub>O contents of 12% or more.\n\nThe abundances of the [[lanthanide]] or [[rare-earth element]]s (REE) can be a useful diagnostic tool to help explain the history of mineral crystallisation as the melt cooled. In particular, the relative abundance of europium compared to the other REE is often markedly higher or lower, and called the [[europium anomaly]]. It arises because Eu<sup>2+</sup> can substitute for Ca<sup>2+</sup> in plagioclase feldspar, unlike any of the other lanthanides, which tend to only form 3+ cations.\n\nMid-ocean ridge basalts (MORB) and their intrusive equivalents, [[gabbro]]s, are the characteristic igneous rocks formed at [[mid-ocean ridge]]s. They are [[tholeiitic basalt]]s particularly low in total alkalis and in [[Compatibility (geochemistry)|incompatible]] trace elements, and they have relatively flat rare-earth element (REE) patterns normalized to mantle or [[chondrite]] values. In contrast, alkali basalts have normalized patterns highly enriched in the light REE, and with greater abundances of the REE and of other incompatible elements. Because MORB basalt is considered a key to understanding [[plate tectonics]], its compositions have been much studied. Although MORB compositions are distinctive relative to average compositions of basalts erupted in other environments, they are not uniform. For instance, compositions change with position along the [[Mid-Atlantic Ridge]], and the compositions also define different ranges in different ocean basins.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Hofmann|first1=A.

Isotopic ratios of [[noble gas]]es, such as <sup>3</sup>[[Helium|He]]/<sup>4</sup>He, are also of great value: for instance, ratios for basalts range from 6 to 10 for mid-ocean ridge tholeiitic basalt (normalized to atmospheric values), but to 15\u201324 and more for ocean-island basalts thought to be derived from [[mantle plume]]s.\n\nSource rocks for the partial melts probably include both [[peridotite]] and [[pyroxenite]] (e.g., Sobolev et al., 2007).\n\n=== Morphology and textures ===\n[[File:20011005-0039 DAS large.jpg|thumb|An active basalt lava flow]]\nThe shape, structure and [[rock microstructure|texture]] of a basalt is diagnostic of how and where it erupted\u2014whether into the sea, in an explosive [[cinder]] eruption or as creeping [[pahoehoe|p\u0101hoehoe]] lava flows, the classic image of [[Hawaii]]an basalt eruptions.\n\n==== Subaerial eruptions ====\n{{Main|Subaerial eruption}}\nBasalt that erupts under open air (that is, [[subaerial]]ly) forms three distinct types of lava or volcanic deposits: [[scoria]]; [[volcanic ash|ash]] or cinder ([[breccia]]); and lava flows.\n\nBasalt in the tops of subaerial lava flows and [[cinder cone]]s will often be highly [[Vesicular texture|vesiculated]], imparting a lightweight \"frothy\" texture to the rock. Basaltic cinders are often red, coloured by oxidized [[iron]] from weathered iron-rich minerals such as [[pyroxene]].\n\n[[Lava#\u02bbA\u02bb\u0101|\u02bbA\u02bb\u0101]] types of blocky, cinder and breccia flows of thick, viscous basaltic [[lava]] are common in Hawai\u02bbi. [[Lava#P\u0101hoehoe|P\u0101hoehoe]] is a highly fluid, hot form of basalt which tends to form thin aprons of molten lava which fill up hollows and sometimes forms [[lava lake]]s. [[Lava tube]]s are common features of p\u0101hoehoe eruptions.\n\nBasaltic [[tuff]] or [[pyroclastic]] rocks are rare but not unknown. Usually basalt is too hot and fluid to build up sufficient pressure to form explosive lava eruptions but occasionally this will happen by trapping of the lava within the volcanic throat and buildup of [[volcanic gas]]es. Hawai\u02bbi's [[Mauna Loa]] volcano erupted in this way in the 19th century, as did [[Mount Tarawera]], New Zealand in its violent 1886 eruption. [[Maar]] volcanoes are typical of small basalt tuffs, formed by explosive eruption of basalt through the crust, forming an apron of mixed basalt and wall rock breccia and a fan of basalt tuff further out from the volcano.\n\nAmygdaloidal structure is common in relict [[vesicle (geology)|vesicles]] and beautifully [[crystal]]lized species of [[zeolite]]s, [[quartz]] or [[calcite]] are frequently found.\n\n===== Columnar basalt =====\n[[File:Causeway-code poet-4.jpg|thumb|The [[Giant's Causeway]] in Northern Ireland]]\n[[File:Boyabat.jpg|thumb|Columnar [[Joint (geology)|jointed]] basalt in [[Turkey]]]]\n[[File:\u041c\u044b\u0441 \u0421\u0442\u043e\u043b\u0431\u0447\u0430\u0442\u044b\u0439. \u041f\u043e\u0441\u043b\u0435 \u0437\u0430\u043a\u0430\u0442\u0430.jpg|thumb|Columnar basalt at [[Cape Stolbchaty]], Russia]]\n{{Main|Columnar jointing}}\n{{See also|List of places with columnar basalt}}\nDuring the cooling of a thick lava flow, contractional [[Joint (geology)|joints]] or fractures form.<ref>Smalley, I.J. 1966.

While a flow can shrink in the vertical dimension without fracturing, it cannot easily accommodate shrinking in the horizontal direction unless cracks form; the extensive fracture network that develops results in the formation of [[Columnar jointing|column]]s. The topology of the lateral shapes of these columns can broadly be classed as a [[random cellular network]]. These structures are predominantly hexagonal in cross-section, but polygons with three to twelve or more sides can be observed.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Weaire|first1=D.|last2=Rivier|first2=N.|title=Soap, cells and statistics\u2014random patterns in two dimensions|journal=Contemporary Physics|date=20 August 2006|volume=25|issue=1|pages=59\u201399|doi=10.1080/00107518408210979|bibcode=1984ConPh..25...59W}}</ref> The size of the columns depends loosely on the rate of cooling; very rapid cooling may result in very small (<1&nbsp;cm diameter) columns, while slow cooling is more likely to produce large columns.\n\n==== Submarine eruptions ====\n{{Main|Submarine eruption}}\n[[File:Pillow basalt crop l.jpg|thumb|Pillow basalts on the south Pacific seafloor]]\n\n===== Pillow basalts =====\n{{Main|Pillow lava}}\nWhen basalt erupts underwater or flows into the sea, contact with the water quenches the surface and the lava forms a distinctive ''pillow'' shape, through which the hot lava breaks to form another pillow. This \"pillow\" texture is very common in underwater basaltic flows and is diagnostic of an underwater eruption environment when found in ancient rocks. Pillows typically consist of a fine-grained core with a glassy crust and have radial jointing. The size of individual pillows varies from 10&nbsp;cm up to several meters.\n\nWhen ''[[pahoehoe|p\u0101hoehoe]]'' lava enters the sea it usually forms pillow basalts. However, when ''\u02bba\u02bb\u0101'' enters the ocean it forms a [[littoral cone]], a small cone-shaped accumulation of tuffaceous debris formed when the blocky ''\u02bba\u02bb\u0101'' lava enters the water and explodes from built-up steam.\n\nThe island of [[Surtsey]] in the [[Atlantic Ocean]] is a basalt volcano which breached the ocean surface in 1963. The initial phase of Surtsey's eruption was highly explosive, as the magma was quite fluid, causing the rock to be blown apart by the boiling steam to form a tuff and cinder cone. This has subsequently moved to a typical p\u0101hoehoe-type behaviour.\n\n[[Volcanic glass]] may be present, particularly as rinds on rapidly chilled surfaces of lava flows, and is commonly (but not exclusively) associated with underwater eruptions.\n\nPillow basalt is also produced by some [[Subglacial eruption|subglacial]] volcanic eruptions.\n\n== Life on basaltic rocks ==\nThe common corrosion features of underwater volcanic basalt suggest that microbial activity may play a significant role in the chemical exchange between basaltic rocks and seawater.  The significant amounts of reduced iron, Fe(II), and manganese, Mn(II), present in basaltic rocks provide potential energy sources for [[bacteria]].  Some Fe(II)-oxidizing bacteria cultured from iron-sulfide surfaces are also able to grow with basaltic rock as a source of Fe(II).<ref>{{cite journal|first=Katrina J. |last=Edwards |first2=Wolfgang |last2=Bach |first3=Daniel R. |last3=Rogers |title=Geomicrobiology of the Ocean Crust: A Role for Chemoautotrophic Fe-Bacteria |journal=Biological Bulletin |volume=204 |issue=2 |pages=180\u2013185 |date=April 2003 |url=http://www.biolbull.org/cgi/content/full/204/2/180 |accessdate=4 November 2015 |doi=10.2307/1543555|pmid=12700150 |jstor=1543555 }}</ref> Fe- and Mn- oxidizing bacteria have been cultured from weathered submarine basalts of [[Loihi Seamount]].<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Templeton|first1=Alexis S.|last2=Staudigel|first2=Hubert|last3=Tebo|first3=Bradley M.|title=Diverse Mn(II)-Oxidizing Bacteria Isolated from Submarine Basalts at Loihi Seamount|journal=Geomicrobiology Journal|date=April 2005|volume=22|issue=3\u20134|pages=127\u2013139|doi=10.1080/01490450590945951}}</ref> The impact of bacteria on altering the chemical composition of basaltic glass (and thus, the [[oceanic crust]]) and seawater suggest that these interactions may lead to an application of [[hydrothermal vents]] to the [[origin of life]].\n\n== Distribution ==\nOn Earth, most basalt [[magma]]s have formed by [[decompression melting]] of the [[mantle (geology)|mantle]].

The largest occurrences of basalt are in the [[ocean floor]] that is almost completely made up by basalt. Above sea level basalt is common in [[ocean island basalt|hotspot islands]] and around volcanic arcs, specially those on thin [[crust (geology)|crust]]. However, the largest volumes of basalt on land correspond to [[continental flood basalt]]s. Continental flood basalts are known to exist in the [[Deccan Traps]] in [[India]], the [[Chilcotin Group]] in [[British Columbia]], [[Canada]], the [[Paran\u00e1 Traps]] in Brazil, the [[Siberian Traps]] in [[Russia]], the [[Karoo]] [[flood basalt]] province in South Africa, the [[Columbia River Plateau]] of [[Washington (state)|Washington]] and [[Oregon]].\n\nMany archipelagoes and [[island nation]]s have an overwhelming majority of their exposed bedrock made up of basalt due to being above hotspots, for example, [[Iceland]] and [[Hawaii|Hawai\u02bbi]].\n\nAncient [[Precambrian]] basalts are usually only found in fold and thrust belts, and are often heavily metamorphosed. These are known as [[greenstone belt]]s, because low-grade [[metamorphism]] of basalt produces [[Chlorite group|chlorite]], [[actinolite]], [[epidote]] and other green minerals.\n\n== Lunar and Martian basalt ==\n[[File:Lunar Olivine Basalt 15555 from Apollo 15 in National Museum of Natural History.jpg|thumb|Lunar [[olivine]] basalt collected by [[Apollo 15]].]]\nThe dark areas visible on Earth's [[moon]], the [[lunar mare|lunar maria]], are plains of [[flood basalt]]ic lava flows. These rocks were sampled by the manned American [[Apollo program]], the robotic Russian [[Luna program]], and are represented among the [[lunar meteorite]]s.\n\nLunar basalts differ from their Earth counterparts principally in their high iron contents, which typically range from about 17 to 22 wt% FeO.

Traditionally, lunar basalts have been classified according to their titanium content, with classes being named high-Ti, low-Ti, and very-low-Ti.

The minerals that gave the original basalt its black colour have been metamorphosed into green minerals.]]\nBasalts are important rocks within [[metamorphic rock|metamorphic]] belts, as they can provide vital information on the conditions of metamorphism within the belt.\n\nMetamorphosed basalts are important hosts for a variety of [[hydrothermal]] [[ore]] deposits, including [[gold]] deposits, [[copper]] deposits, [[volcanogenic massive sulfide ore deposit]]s and others.\n\n=== Weathering ===\n{{Main|Weathering}}\nCompared to other rocks found on Earth's surface, basalts weather relatively fast. The typically iron-rich minerals oxidise rapidly in water and air, staining the rock a brown to red colour due to iron oxide (rust). Chemical weathering also releases readily water-soluble [[cation]]s such as [[calcium]], [[sodium]] and [[magnesium]], which give basaltic areas a strong [[Buffer zone|buffer]] capacity against [[Soil acidification|acidification]]. Calcium released by basalts binds up [[carbon dioxide|CO<sub>2</sub>]] from the atmosphere forming [[Calcium carbonate|CaCO<sub>3</sub>]] acting thus as a CO<sub>2</sub> trap. To this it must be added that the eruption of basalt itself is often associated with the release of large quantities of CO<sub>2</sub> into the atmosphere from [[volcanic gas]]es.\n\n== Uses ==\n\nBasalt is used in construction (e.g. as building blocks or in the groundwork), making [[cobblestone]]s (from columnar basalt) and in making [[statue]]s. Heating and extruding basalt yields [[stone wool]], said to be an excellent [[thermal insulation|thermal insulator]].\n\n[[Carbon sequestration]] in basalt has been studied as a means of removing carbon dioxide, produced by human industrialization, from the atmosphere. Underwater basalt deposits, scattered in seas around the globe, have the added benefit of the water serving as a barrier to the re-release of CO<sub>2</sub> into the atmosphere.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Hance|first1=Jeremy|title=Underwater rocks could be used for massive carbon storage on America's East Coast|url=http://news.mongabay.com/2010/0104-hance_ccs.html|accessdate=4 November 2015|publisher=Mongabay|date=5 January 2010}}</ref>\n\n== See also ==\n\n* {{annotated link|Basalt fan structure}}\n* {{annotated link|Basalt fiber}}\n* {{annotated link|Flood basalt}}\n* {{annotated link|Igneous rock}}\n* {{annotated link|Mafic}}\n* [[Polybaric melting]]\n* {{annotated link|Spilite}}\n* {{annotated link|Sideromelane}}\n* {{annotated link|Volcano}}\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==Further reading==\n{{Refbegin}}\n*{{cite book|last1=Alexander Ablesimov|first1=N.

Basalt commonly features a very fine-grained or [[volcanic glass|glassy]] matrix interspersed with visible mineral grains. The average density is 3.0 g/cm<sup>3</sup>.\n\nBasalt is defined by its mineral content and [[Igneous textures|texture]], and physical descriptions without mineralogical context may be unreliable in some circumstances. Basalt is usually grey to black in colour, but rapidly weathers to brown or rust-red due to oxidation of its [[mafic]] (iron-rich) minerals into [[hematite]] and other iron oxides and hydroxides. Although usually characterized as \"dark\", basaltic rocks exhibit a wide range of shading due to regional geochemical processes. Due to weathering or high concentrations of plagioclase, some basalts can be quite light-coloured, superficially resembling [[andesite]] to untrained eyes. Basalt has a [[fine-grained]] mineral texture due to the molten rock cooling too quickly for large mineral crystals to grow; it is often [[porphyritic]], containing larger crystals ([[phenocryst]]s) formed prior to the extrusion that brought the magma to the surface, embedded in a finer-grained [[Matrix (geology)|matrix]].  These phenocrysts usually are of [[olivine]] or a calcium-rich plagioclase, which have the highest melting temperatures of the typical [[mineral]]s that can crystallize from the melt.\n\nBasalt with a [[vesicular texture]] is called vesicular basalt, when the bulk of the rock is mostly solid; when the vesicles are over half the volume of a specimen, it is called [[scoria]].  This texture forms when dissolved gases come out of solution and form bubbles as the magma decompresses as it reaches the surface, yet are trapped as the erupted lava hardens before the gases can escape.\n\nThe term basalt is at times applied to shallow [[intrusive rock]]s with a composition typical of basalt, but rocks of this composition with a [[phaneritic]] (coarser) groundmass are generally referred to as [[diabase]] (also called dolerite) or, when more coarse-grained (crystals over 2&nbsp;mm across), as [[gabbro]].  Gabbro is often marketed commercially as \"black granite.\"\n[[File:Szentgy\u00f6rgyhegy03.jpg|thumb|upright|Columnar basalt at Szent Gy\u00f6rgy Hill, Hungary]]\n[[File:VessicularBasalt1.JPG|thumb|Vesicular basalt at [[Sunset Crater]], Arizona. [[US quarter]] for scale.]]\n\nIn the [[Hadean]], [[Archean]], and early [[Proterozoic]] eras of Earth's history, the chemistry of erupted magmas was significantly different from today's, due to immature crustal and [[asthenosphere]] differentiation.  These [[Ultramafic rock|ultramafic]] volcanic rocks, with silica (SiO<sub>2</sub>) contents below 45% are usually classified as [[komatiite]]s.\n\n=== Etymology ===\nThe word \"basalt\" is ultimately derived from [[Late Latin]] ''basaltes'', a misspelling of Latin ''basanites'' \"very hard stone\", which was imported from [[Ancient Greek]] \u03b2\u03b1\u03c3\u03b1\u03bd\u03af\u03c4\u03b7\u03c2 (''basanites''), from \u03b2\u03ac\u03c3\u03b1\u03bd\u03bf\u03c2 (''basanos'', \"[[touchstone (assaying tool)|touchstone]]\") and perhaps originated in [[Egyptian language|Egyptian]] ''bauhun'' \"slate\".<ref>{{cite encyclopedia|title=basalt (n.) |encyclopedia=Online Etymology Dictionary |first=Douglas |last=Harper |url=http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=basalt |accessdate=4 November 2015}}</ref> The modern petrological term ''basalt'' describing a particular composition of lava-derived rock originates from its use by [[Georgius Agricola]] in 1556 in his famous work of mining and mineralogy ''[[De re metallica]], libri XII''. Agricola applied \"basalt\" to the volcanic black rock of the [[Schlo\u00dfberg (Stolpen)|Schlo\u00dfberg]] (local castle hill) at [[Stolpen]], believing it to be the same as the \"very hard stone\" described by [[Pliny the Elder]] in [[Natural History (Pliny)|''Naturalis Historiae'']].<ref>[[Pliny the Elder]], [[Natural History (Pliny)|''Naturalis Historiae'']].

[[Olivine]] can also be a significant constituent. Accessory [[mineral]]s present in relatively minor amounts include [[iron oxide]]s and iron-titanium oxides, such as [[magnetite]], [[ulv\u00f6spinel]], and [[ilmenite]]. Because of the presence of such [[oxide]] minerals, basalt can acquire strong [[magnetism|magnetic]] signatures as it cools, and [[paleomagnetism|paleomagnetic]] studies have made extensive use of basalt.\n\nIn [[tholeiitic basalt]], pyroxene ([[augite]] and [[orthopyroxene]] or [[pigeonite]]) and [[calcium]]-rich plagioclase are common [[phenocryst]] minerals. Olivine may also be a phenocryst, and when present, may have rims of pigeonite.  The [[groundmass]] contains interstitial [[quartz]] or [[tridymite]] or [[cristobalite]]. ''Olivine tholeiitic basalt'' has augite and orthopyroxene or pigeonite with abundant olivine, but olivine may have rims of pyroxene and is unlikely to be present in the [[matrix (geology)|groundmass]]. Ocean floor basalts, erupted originally at mid-ocean ridges, are known as MORB (mid-ocean ridge basalt) and are characteristically low in incompatible elements.\n\n[[Alkali basalt]]s typically have mineral assemblages that lack orthopyroxene but contain olivine. Feldspar phenocrysts typically are [[labradorite]] to [[andesine]] in composition. Augite is rich in titanium compared to augite in tholeiitic basalt. Minerals such as [[feldspar|alkali feldspar]], [[leucite]], [[nepheline]], [[sodalite]], [[phlogopite]] mica, and [[apatite]] may be present in the groundmass.\n\nBasalt has high [[liquidus]] and [[Solidus (chemistry)|solidus]] temperatures\u2014values at the Earth's surface are near or above 1200&nbsp;\u00b0C (liquidus) and near or below 1000&nbsp;\u00b0C (solidus); these values are higher than those of other common [[igneous rock]]s.\n\nThe majority of tholeiitic basalts are formed at approximately 50\u2013100&nbsp;km depth within the mantle. Many alkali basalts may be formed at greater depths, perhaps as deep as 150\u2013200&nbsp;km.<ref>{{Cite book|chapter-url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/book/9780750633864|title=Plate Tectonics and Crustal Evolution|last=Condie|first=Kent C.|publisher=Butterworth-Heinemann / Elsevier|year=1997|isbn=978-0-7506-3386-4|location=|pages=69|chapter=Chapter 3: \"Tectonic settings\"}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal|last=KUSHIRO|first=Ikuo|date=2007|title=Origin of magmas in subduction zones: a review of experimental studies|url=https://www.jstage.jst.go.jp/article/pjab/83/1/83_1_1/_pdf/-char/en|journal=Proceedings of the Japan Academy, Series B|language=en|volume=83|issue=1|pages=1\u201315|doi=10.2183/pjab.83.1|pmid=24019580|pmc=3756732|issn=0386-2208|bibcode=2007PJAB...83....1K}}</ref> The origin of high-alumina basalt continues to be controversial, with disagreement over whether it is a [[magma|primary melt]] or derived from other basalt types by fractionation.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Ozerov|first1=Alexei Y|title=The evolution of high-alumina basalts of the Klyuchevskoy volcano, Kamchatka, Russia, based on microprobe analyses of mineral inclusions|journal=Journal of Volcanology and Geothermal Research|date=January 2000|volume=95|issue=1\u20134|pages=65\u201379|doi=10.1016/S0377-0273(99)00118-3|bibcode=2000JVGR...95...65O|url=http://repo.kscnet.ru/2569/1/my_2000_f_en_JVGR.pdf}}</ref>{{rp|65}}\n\n=== Geochemistry ===\nRelative to most common [[igneous rock]]s, basalt compositions are rich in [[magnesium oxide|MgO]] and [[calcium oxide|CaO]] and low in [[silicon dioxide|SiO<sub>2</sub>]] and the alkali oxides, i.e., [[sodium oxide|Na<sub>2</sub>O]] + [[potassium oxide|K<sub>2</sub>O]], consistent with the [[TAS classification]].\n\nBasalt generally has a composition of 45\u201355 wt% SiO<sub>2</sub>, 2\u20136 wt% total alkalis, 0.5\u20132.0 wt% [[titanium dioxide|TiO<sub>2</sub>]], 5\u201314 wt% [[iron(II) oxide|FeO]] and 14 wt% or more [[alumina|Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>]]. Contents of CaO are commonly near 10 wt%, those of MgO commonly in the range 5 to 12 wt%.\n\nHigh-alumina basalts have aluminium contents of 17\u201319 wt% Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>; [[boninite]]s have [[magnesium]] (MgO) contents of up to 15 percent. Rare [[feldspathoid]]-rich [[mafic]] rocks, akin to alkali basalts, may have Na<sub>2</sub>O + K<sub>2</sub>O contents of 12% or more.\n\nThe abundances of the [[lanthanide]] or [[rare-earth element]]s (REE) can be a useful diagnostic tool to help explain the history of mineral crystallisation as the melt cooled. In particular, the relative abundance of europium compared to the other REE is often markedly higher or lower, and called the [[europium anomaly]]. It arises because Eu<sup>2+</sup> can substitute for Ca<sup>2+</sup> in plagioclase feldspar, unlike any of the other lanthanides, which tend to only form 3+ cations.\n\nMid-ocean ridge basalts (MORB) and their intrusive equivalents, [[gabbro]]s, are the characteristic igneous rocks formed at [[mid-ocean ridge]]s. They are [[tholeiitic basalt]]s particularly low in total alkalis and in [[Compatibility (geochemistry)|incompatible]] trace elements, and they have relatively flat rare-earth element (REE) patterns normalized to mantle or [[chondrite]] values. In contrast, alkali basalts have normalized patterns highly enriched in the light REE, and with greater abundances of the REE and of other incompatible elements. Because MORB basalt is considered a key to understanding [[plate tectonics]], its compositions have been much studied. Although MORB compositions are distinctive relative to average compositions of basalts erupted in other environments, they are not uniform. For instance, compositions change with position along the [[Mid-Atlantic Ridge]], and the compositions also define different ranges in different ocean basins.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Hofmann|first1=A.

Isotopic ratios of [[noble gas]]es, such as <sup>3</sup>[[Helium|He]]/<sup>4</sup>He, are also of great value: for instance, ratios for basalts range from 6 to 10 for mid-ocean ridge tholeiitic basalt (normalized to atmospheric values), but to 15\u201324 and more for ocean-island basalts thought to be derived from [[mantle plume]]s.\n\nSource rocks for the partial melts probably include both [[peridotite]] and [[pyroxenite]] (e.g., Sobolev et al., 2007).\n\n=== Morphology and textures ===\n[[File:20011005-0039 DAS large.jpg|thumb|An active basalt lava flow]]\nThe shape, structure and [[rock microstructure|texture]] of a basalt is diagnostic of how and where it erupted\u2014whether into the sea, in an explosive [[cinder]] eruption or as creeping [[pahoehoe|p\u0101hoehoe]] lava flows, the classic image of [[Hawaii]]an basalt eruptions.\n\n==== Subaerial eruptions ====\n{{Main|Subaerial eruption}}\nBasalt that erupts under open air (that is, [[subaerial]]ly) forms three distinct types of lava or volcanic deposits: [[scoria]]; [[volcanic ash|ash]] or cinder ([[breccia]]); and lava flows.\n\nBasalt in the tops of subaerial lava flows and [[cinder cone]]s will often be highly [[Vesicular texture|vesiculated]], imparting a lightweight \"frothy\" texture to the rock. Basaltic cinders are often red, coloured by oxidized [[iron]] from weathered iron-rich minerals such as [[pyroxene]].\n\n[[Lava#\u02bbA\u02bb\u0101|\u02bbA\u02bb\u0101]] types of blocky, cinder and breccia flows of thick, viscous basaltic [[lava]] are common in Hawai\u02bbi. [[Lava#P\u0101hoehoe|P\u0101hoehoe]] is a highly fluid, hot form of basalt which tends to form thin aprons of molten lava which fill up hollows and sometimes forms [[lava lake]]s. [[Lava tube]]s are common features of p\u0101hoehoe eruptions.\n\nBasaltic [[tuff]] or [[pyroclastic]] rocks are rare but not unknown. Usually basalt is too hot and fluid to build up sufficient pressure to form explosive lava eruptions but occasionally this will happen by trapping of the lava within the volcanic throat and buildup of [[volcanic gas]]es. Hawai\u02bbi's [[Mauna Loa]] volcano erupted in this way in the 19th century, as did [[Mount Tarawera]], New Zealand in its violent 1886 eruption. [[Maar]] volcanoes are typical of small basalt tuffs, formed by explosive eruption of basalt through the crust, forming an apron of mixed basalt and wall rock breccia and a fan of basalt tuff further out from the volcano.\n\nAmygdaloidal structure is common in relict [[vesicle (geology)|vesicles]] and beautifully [[crystal]]lized species of [[zeolite]]s, [[quartz]] or [[calcite]] are frequently found.\n\n===== Columnar basalt =====\n[[File:Causeway-code poet-4.jpg|thumb|The [[Giant's Causeway]] in Northern Ireland]]\n[[File:Boyabat.jpg|thumb|Columnar [[Joint (geology)|jointed]] basalt in [[Turkey]]]]\n[[File:\u041c\u044b\u0441 \u0421\u0442\u043e\u043b\u0431\u0447\u0430\u0442\u044b\u0439. \u041f\u043e\u0441\u043b\u0435 \u0437\u0430\u043a\u0430\u0442\u0430.jpg|thumb|Columnar basalt at [[Cape Stolbchaty]], Russia]]\n{{Main|Columnar jointing}}\n{{See also|List of places with columnar basalt}}\nDuring the cooling of a thick lava flow, contractional [[Joint (geology)|joints]] or fractures form.<ref>Smalley, I.J. 1966.

These structures are predominantly hexagonal in cross-section, but polygons with three to twelve or more sides can be observed.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Weaire|first1=D.|last2=Rivier|first2=N.|title=Soap, cells and statistics\u2014random patterns in two dimensions|journal=Contemporary Physics|date=20 August 2006|volume=25|issue=1|pages=59\u201399|doi=10.1080/00107518408210979|bibcode=1984ConPh..25...59W}}</ref> The size of the columns depends loosely on the rate of cooling; very rapid cooling may result in very small (<1&nbsp;cm diameter) columns, while slow cooling is more likely to produce large columns.\n\n==== Submarine eruptions ====\n{{Main|Submarine eruption}}\n[[File:Pillow basalt crop l.jpg|thumb|Pillow basalts on the south Pacific seafloor]]\n\n===== Pillow basalts =====\n{{Main|Pillow lava}}\nWhen basalt erupts underwater or flows into the sea, contact with the water quenches the surface and the lava forms a distinctive ''pillow'' shape, through which the hot lava breaks to form another pillow. This \"pillow\" texture is very common in underwater basaltic flows and is diagnostic of an underwater eruption environment when found in ancient rocks. Pillows typically consist of a fine-grained core with a glassy crust and have radial jointing. The size of individual pillows varies from 10&nbsp;cm up to several meters.\n\nWhen ''[[pahoehoe|p\u0101hoehoe]]'' lava enters the sea it usually forms pillow basalts. However, when ''\u02bba\u02bb\u0101'' enters the ocean it forms a [[littoral cone]], a small cone-shaped accumulation of tuffaceous debris formed when the blocky ''\u02bba\u02bb\u0101'' lava enters the water and explodes from built-up steam.\n\nThe island of [[Surtsey]] in the [[Atlantic Ocean]] is a basalt volcano which breached the ocean surface in 1963. The initial phase of Surtsey's eruption was highly explosive, as the magma was quite fluid, causing the rock to be blown apart by the boiling steam to form a tuff and cinder cone. This has subsequently moved to a typical p\u0101hoehoe-type behaviour.\n\n[[Volcanic glass]] may be present, particularly as rinds on rapidly chilled surfaces of lava flows, and is commonly (but not exclusively) associated with underwater eruptions.\n\nPillow basalt is also produced by some [[Subglacial eruption|subglacial]] volcanic eruptions.\n\n== Life on basaltic rocks ==\nThe common corrosion features of underwater volcanic basalt suggest that microbial activity may play a significant role in the chemical exchange between basaltic rocks and seawater.  The significant amounts of reduced iron, Fe(II), and manganese, Mn(II), present in basaltic rocks provide potential energy sources for [[bacteria]].  Some Fe(II)-oxidizing bacteria cultured from iron-sulfide surfaces are also able to grow with basaltic rock as a source of Fe(II).<ref>{{cite journal|first=Katrina J. |last=Edwards |first2=Wolfgang |last2=Bach |first3=Daniel R. |last3=Rogers |title=Geomicrobiology of the Ocean Crust: A Role for Chemoautotrophic Fe-Bacteria |journal=Biological Bulletin |volume=204 |issue=2 |pages=180\u2013185 |date=April 2003 |url=http://www.biolbull.org/cgi/content/full/204/2/180 |accessdate=4 November 2015 |doi=10.2307/1543555|pmid=12700150 |jstor=1543555 }}</ref> Fe- and Mn- oxidizing bacteria have been cultured from weathered submarine basalts of [[Loihi Seamount]].<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Templeton|first1=Alexis S.|last2=Staudigel|first2=Hubert|last3=Tebo|first3=Bradley M.|title=Diverse Mn(II)-Oxidizing Bacteria Isolated from Submarine Basalts at Loihi Seamount|journal=Geomicrobiology Journal|date=April 2005|volume=22|issue=3\u20134|pages=127\u2013139|doi=10.1080/01490450590945951}}</ref> The impact of bacteria on altering the chemical composition of basaltic glass (and thus, the [[oceanic crust]]) and seawater suggest that these interactions may lead to an application of [[hydrothermal vents]] to the [[origin of life]].\n\n== Distribution ==\nOn Earth, most basalt [[magma]]s have formed by [[decompression melting]] of the [[mantle (geology)|mantle]].

The largest occurrences of basalt are in the [[ocean floor]] that is almost completely made up by basalt. Above sea level basalt is common in [[ocean island basalt|hotspot islands]] and around volcanic arcs, specially those on thin [[crust (geology)|crust]]. However, the largest volumes of basalt on land correspond to [[continental flood basalt]]s. Continental flood basalts are known to exist in the [[Deccan Traps]] in [[India]], the [[Chilcotin Group]] in [[British Columbia]], [[Canada]], the [[Paran\u00e1 Traps]] in Brazil, the [[Siberian Traps]] in [[Russia]], the [[Karoo]] [[flood basalt]] province in South Africa, the [[Columbia River Plateau]] of [[Washington (state)|Washington]] and [[Oregon]].\n\nMany archipelagoes and [[island nation]]s have an overwhelming majority of their exposed bedrock made up of basalt due to being above hotspots, for example, [[Iceland]] and [[Hawaii|Hawai\u02bbi]].\n\nAncient [[Precambrian]] basalts are usually only found in fold and thrust belts, and are often heavily metamorphosed. These are known as [[greenstone belt]]s, because low-grade [[metamorphism]] of basalt produces [[Chlorite group|chlorite]], [[actinolite]], [[epidote]] and other green minerals.\n\n== Lunar and Martian basalt ==\n[[File:Lunar Olivine Basalt 15555 from Apollo 15 in National Museum of Natural History.jpg|thumb|Lunar [[olivine]] basalt collected by [[Apollo 15]].]]\nThe dark areas visible on Earth's [[moon]], the [[lunar mare|lunar maria]], are plains of [[flood basalt]]ic lava flows. These rocks were sampled by the manned American [[Apollo program]], the robotic Russian [[Luna program]], and are represented among the [[lunar meteorite]]s.\n\nLunar basalts differ from their Earth counterparts principally in their high iron contents, which typically range from about 17 to 22 wt% FeO. They also possess a wide range of titanium concentrations (present in the mineral [[ilmenite]]),<ref name=\"NYT-20151228\">{{cite news |last=Bhanoo |first=Sindya N. |title=New Type of Rock Is Discovered on Moon |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2015/12/29/science/new-type-of-rock-is-discovered-on-moon.html |date=28 December 2015 |work=[[The New York Times]] |accessdate=29 December 2015 }}</ref> ranging from less than 1 wt% TiO<sub>2</sub>, to about 13 wt.%. Traditionally, lunar basalts have been classified according to their titanium content, with classes being named high-Ti, low-Ti, and very-low-Ti.

The minerals that gave the original basalt its black colour have been metamorphosed into green minerals.]]\nBasalts are important rocks within [[metamorphic rock|metamorphic]] belts, as they can provide vital information on the conditions of metamorphism within the belt.\n\nMetamorphosed basalts are important hosts for a variety of [[hydrothermal]] [[ore]] deposits, including [[gold]] deposits, [[copper]] deposits, [[volcanogenic massive sulfide ore deposit]]s and others.\n\n=== Weathering ===\n{{Main|Weathering}}\nCompared to other rocks found on Earth's surface, basalts weather relatively fast. The typically iron-rich minerals oxidise rapidly in water and air, staining the rock a brown to red colour due to iron oxide (rust). Chemical weathering also releases readily water-soluble [[cation]]s such as [[calcium]], [[sodium]] and [[magnesium]], which give basaltic areas a strong [[Buffer zone|buffer]] capacity against [[Soil acidification|acidification]]. Calcium released by basalts binds up [[carbon dioxide|CO<sub>2</sub>]] from the atmosphere forming [[Calcium carbonate|CaCO<sub>3</sub>]] acting thus as a CO<sub>2</sub> trap. To this it must be added that the eruption of basalt itself is often associated with the release of large quantities of CO<sub>2</sub> into the atmosphere from [[volcanic gas]]es.\n\n== Uses ==\n\nBasalt is used in construction (e.g. as building blocks or in the groundwork), making [[cobblestone]]s (from columnar basalt) and in making [[statue]]s. Heating and extruding basalt yields [[stone wool]], said to be an excellent [[thermal insulation|thermal insulator]].\n\n[[Carbon sequestration]] in basalt has been studied as a means of removing carbon dioxide, produced by human industrialization, from the atmosphere. Underwater basalt deposits, scattered in seas around the globe, have the added benefit of the water serving as a barrier to the re-release of CO<sub>2</sub> into the atmosphere.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Hance|first1=Jeremy|title=Underwater rocks could be used for massive carbon storage on America's East Coast|url=http://news.mongabay.com/2010/0104-hance_ccs.html|accessdate=4 November 2015|publisher=Mongabay|date=5 January 2010}}</ref>\n\n== See also ==\n\n* {{annotated link|Basalt fan structure}}\n* {{annotated link|Basalt fiber}}\n* {{annotated link|Flood basalt}}\n* {{annotated link|Igneous rock}}\n* {{annotated link|Mafic}}\n* [[Polybaric melting]]\n* {{annotated link|Spilite}}\n* {{annotated link|Sideromelane}}\n* {{annotated link|Volcano}}\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==Further reading==\n{{Refbegin}}\n*{{cite book|last1=Alexander Ablesimov|first1=N.

Metamorphism causes variable recrystallization of the original carbonate mineral grains. The resulting marble rock is typically composed of an interlocking mosaic of carbonate [[crystal]]s. Primary sedimentary textures and structures of the original carbonate rock ([[protolith]]) have typically been modified or destroyed.\n\nPure white marble is the result of metamorphism of a very pure ([[Silicate minerals|silicate]]-poor) limestone or dolomite protolith. The characteristic swirls and [[Vein (geology)|vein]]s of many colored marble varieties are usually due to various mineral impurities such as [[clay]], [[silt]], [[sand]], [[iron oxide]]s, or [[chert]] which were originally present as grains or layers in the limestone. Green coloration is often due to [[Serpentine group|serpentine]] resulting from originally magnesium-rich limestone or dolomite with [[silica]] impurities.

Metamorphism causes variable recrystallization of the original carbonate mineral grains. The resulting marble rock is typically composed of an interlocking mosaic of carbonate [[crystal]]s. Primary sedimentary textures and structures of the original carbonate rock ([[protolith]]) have typically been modified or destroyed.\n\nPure white marble is the result of metamorphism of a very pure ([[Silicate minerals|silicate]]-poor) limestone or dolomite protolith. The characteristic swirls and [[Vein (geology)|vein]]s of many colored marble varieties are usually due to various mineral impurities such as [[clay]], [[silt]], [[sand]], [[iron oxide]]s, or [[chert]] which were originally present as grains or layers in the limestone. Green coloration is often due to [[Serpentine group|serpentine]] resulting from originally magnesium-rich limestone or dolomite with [[silica]] impurities. These various impurities have been mobilized and recrystallized by the intense pressure and heat of the metamorphism.\n\n==Types==\n{{Main|List of types of marble}}\nExamples of historically notable marble varieties and locations:\n\n{| class=wikitable\n|-\n!

Granites can be predominantly white, pink, or gray in color, depending on their [[mineralogy]]. The word \"granite\" comes from the [[Latin]] ''granum'', a grain, in reference to the coarse-grained structure of such a [[holocrystalline|completely crystalline]] rock. Strictly speaking, granite is an igneous rock with between 20% and 60% [[quartz]] by volume, and at least 35% of the total feldspar consisting of [[alkali feldspar]], although commonly the term \"granite\" is used to refer to a wider range of coarse-grained igneous rocks containing quartz and feldspar.\n\nThe term \"granitic\" means granite-like and is applied to granite and a group of intrusive igneous rocks with similar textures and slight variations in composition and origin. These rocks mainly consist of [[feldspar]], [[quartz]], [[mica]], and [[amphibole]] [[mineral]]s, which form an interlocking, somewhat [[equigranular]] [[Matrix (geology)|matrix]] of feldspar and quartz with scattered darker [[biotite]] mica and amphibole (often [[hornblende]]) peppering the lighter color minerals. Occasionally some individual crystals ([[phenocryst]]s) are larger than the [[groundmass]], in which case the texture is known as [[porphyritic]]. A granitic rock with a porphyritic texture is known as a granite [[Porphyry (geology)|porphyry]]. [[Granitoid]] is a general, descriptive [[Field research|field]] term for lighter-colored, coarse-grained igneous rocks. [[Petrography|Petrographic]] examination is required for identification of specific types of granitoids.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://geology.about.com/od/more_igrocks/a/granitoids.htm |title=Granitoids \u2013 Granite and the Related Rocks Granodiorite, Diorite and Tonalite |publisher=Geology.about.com |date=2010-02-06 |accessdate=2010-05-09}}</ref> The [[extrusive]] igneous rock equivalent of granite is [[rhyolite]].<ref name=\"Haldar2014\">{{cite book | title=Introduction to Mineralogy and Petrology | publisher=Elsevier |author1=Haldar, S.K.  |author2=Ti\u0161ljar, J. | year=2014 | page=116 | isbn=978-0-12-408133-8}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Granite under Polarized light.jpg|thumb|A microscopic picture of granite]]\nGranite is nearly always massive (i.e., lacking any internal structures), hard, and tough.

[[Outcrop]]s of granite tend to form [[tor (rock formation)|tors]] and rounded [[massif]]s. Granites sometimes occur in circular [[depression (geology)|depression]]s surrounded by a range of hills, formed by the [[metamorphic aureole]] or [[hornfels]]. Granite often occurs as relatively small, less than 100&nbsp;km<sup>2</sup> stock masses ([[stock (geology)|stocks]]) and in [[batholith]]s that are often associated with [[orogeny|orogenic]] [[mountain]] ranges. Small [[dike (geology)|dikes]] of granitic composition called [[aplite]]s are often associated with the margins of granitic [[intrusion (geology)|intrusion]]s. In some locations, very coarse-grained [[pegmatite]] masses occur with granite.\n\n==Origin==\nGranite has a felsic composition and is more common in continental crust than in oceanic crust. They are crystallized from felsic melts which are less dense than mafic rocks and thus tend to ascend toward the surface. In contrast, mafic rocks, either basalts or gabbros, once metamorphosed at eclogite facies, tend to sink into the mantle beneath the [[Mohorovi\u010di\u0107 discontinuity|Moho]].\n\n===Petrogenetic mechanism===\nGranitoids have crystallized from felsic magmas that have compositions at or near a eutectic point (or a temperature minimum on a cotectic curve). Magmas are composed of melts and minerals in variable abundances. Traditionally, magmatic minerals are crystallized from the melts that have completely separated from their parental rocks and thus are highly evolved because of igneous differentiation. If a granite has a slowly cooling process, it has the potential to form larger crystals.\n\nThere are also peritectic and residual minerals in granitic magmas. Peritectic minerals are generated through peritectic reactions, whereas residual minerals are inherited from parental rocks. In either case, magmas will evolve to the eutectic for crystallization upon cooling. Anatectic melts are also produced by peritectic reactions, but they are much less evolved than magmatic melts because they have not separated from their parental rocks. Nevertheless, the composition of anatectic melts may change toward the magmatic melts through high-degree fractional crystallization.\n\nFractional crystallisation serves to reduce a melt in iron, magnesium, titanium, calcium and sodium, and enrich the melt in potassium and silicon \u2013 alkali feldspar (rich in potassium) and quartz (SiO2), are two of the defining constituents of granite. This process operates regardless of the origin of parental magmas to granites, and regardless of their chemistry.\n\n===Alphabet classification system===\nThe composition and origin of any magma that differentiates into granite leave certain petrological evidence as to what the granite's parental rock was. The final texture and composition of a granite are generally distinctive as to its parental rock. For instance, a granite that is derived from partial melting of metasedimentary rocks may have more alkali feldspar, whereas a granite derived from partial melting of metaigneous rocks may be richer in plagioclase. It is on this basis that the modern \"alphabet\" classification schemes are based.\n\nThe letter-based Chappell & White classification system was proposed initially to divide granites into [[I-type granite|I-type]] (igneous source) granite and S-type (sedimentary sources).<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Chappell |first1=B. W. |last2=White |first2=A. J. R. |title=Two contrasting granite types: 25 years later |journal=Australian Journal of Earth Sciences |date=2001 |volume=48 |issue=4 |pages=489\u2013499 |doi=10.1046/j.1440-0952.2001.00882.x}}</ref> Both types are produced by partial melting of crustal rocks, either metaigneous rocks or metasedimentary rocks.\n\nM-type granite was later proposed to cover those granites that were clearly sourced from crystallized mafic magmas, generally sourced from the mantle. However, this proposal has been rejected by studies of experimental petrology, which demonstrate that partial melting of mantle [[peridotite]] cannot produce granitic melts in any case. Although the fractional crystallisation of basaltic melts can yield small amounts of granites, such granites must occur together with large amounts of basaltic rocks.\n\nA-type granites were defined as to occur in anorogenic setting, have alkaline and anhydrous compositions. They show a peculiar mineralogy and geochemistry, with particularly high silicon and potassium at the expense of calcium and magnesium.<ref>Winter, J.D. (2010) Principles of Igneous and Metamorphic Petrology. 2nd Edition, page 381.</ref> These granites are produced by partial melting of refractory lithology such as granulites in the lower continental crust at high thermal gradients. This leads to significant extraction of hydrous felsic melts from granulite-facies resitites. A-type granites occur in the Koettlitz Glacier Alkaline Province in the Royal Society Range, Antarctica. The rhyolites of the Yellowstone Caldera are examples of volcanic equivalents of A-type granite.\n\nH-type granites were suggested for hybrid granites, which were hypothesized to form by mixing between mafic and felsic from different sources, e.g. M-type and S-type. However, the big difference in rheology between mafic and felsic magmas makes this process hardly happening in nature.\n\n===Granitization===\nAn old, and largely discounted process, granitization states that granite is formed in place through extreme metasomatism by fluids bringing in elements, e.g. potassium, and removing others, e.g. calcium, to transform a metamorphic rock into a granite. This was supposed to occur across a migrating front.\n\nAfter more than 50 years of studies, it becomes clear that granitic magmas have separated from their sources and experienced fractional crystallization during their ascent toward the surface. On the other hand, granitic melts can be produced in place through the partial melting of metamorphic rocks by extracting melt-mobile elements such as potassium and silicon into the melts but leaving others such as calcium and iron in granulite residues. Once a metamorphic rock is melted, it becomes a kind of migmatites which are composed of leucosome and melanosome.\n\nIn nature, metamorphic rocks may undergo partial melting to transform into migmatites through peritectic reactions, with anatectic melts to crystallize as leucosomes. As soon as the anatectic melts have separated from their sources and highly evolved through fractional crystallization during their ascent toward the surface, they become the magmatic melts and minerals of granitic composition.\n\nAfter the extraction of anatectic melts, the migmatites become a kind of granulites. In all cases, the partial melting of solid rocks requires high temperatures, and also water or other volatiles which act as a catalyst by lowering the solidus temperature of these rocks. The production of granite at crustal depths requires high heat flow, which cannot be provided by heat production elements in the crust. Furthermore, high heat flow is necessary to produce granulite facies metamorphic rocks in orogens, indicating extreme metamorphism at high thermal gradients. In-situ granitisation by the extreme metamorphism is possible if crustal rocks would be heated by the asthenospheric mantle in rifting orogens, where collision-thickened orogenic lithosphere is thinned at first and then underwent extensional tectonism for active rifting.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Zheng |first1=Y.-F. |last2=Chen |first2=R.-X. |title=Regional metamorphism at extreme conditions: Implications for orogeny at convergent plate margins |journal=Journal of Asian Earth Sciences |date=2017 |volume=145 |pages=46\u201373 |doi=10.1016/j.jseaes.2017.03.009}}</ref>\n\n==Ascent and emplacement==\nThe ascent and emplacement of large volumes of granite within the upper continental crust is a source of much debate amongst geologists. There is a lack of field evidence for any proposed mechanisms, so hypotheses are predominantly based upon experimental data. There are two major hypotheses for the ascent of magma through the crust:\n\n*Stokes [[diapir]]\n*[[Fracture (geology)|Fracture propagation]]\n\nOf these two mechanisms, Stokes diapir was favoured for many years in the absence of a reasonable alternative. The basic idea is that magma will rise through the crust as a single mass through [[buoyancy]]. As it rises, it heats the [[Country rock (geology)|wall rocks]], causing them to behave as a [[power-law fluid]] and thus flow around the [[pluton]] allowing it to pass rapidly and without major heat loss.<ref>{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1029/93JB03461| title = Diapiric ascent of magmas through power law crust and mantle| journal = Journal of Geophysical Research| volume = 99| issue = B5| page = 9543| year = 1994| last1 = Weinberg | first1 = R.

Rocks there do not deform so easily: for magma to rise as a pluton it would expend far too much energy in heating wall rocks, thus cooling and solidifying before reaching higher levels within the crust.\n\n[[Fracture (geology)|Fracture]] propagation is the mechanism preferred by many geologists as it largely eliminates the major problems of moving a huge mass of magma through cold brittle crust. Magma rises instead in small channels along self-propagating [[Dike (geology)|dykes]] which form along new or pre-existing fracture or [[fault (geology)|fault]] systems and networks of active shear zones.<ref>{{cite journal|title=Observations on the origins and ascent mechanisms of granitic magmas|journal=Journal of the Geological Society of London|year=1998|first=John|last=Clemens|volume=155|issue=Part 5|pages=843\u201351 | doi = 10.1144/gsjgs.155.5.0843 |url=http://eprints.kingston.ac.uk/2904/|bibcode=1998JGSoc.155..843C}}</ref> As these narrow conduits open, the first magma to enter solidifies and provides a form of insulation for later magma.\n\nGranitic magma must make room for itself or be intruded into other rocks in order to form an intrusion, and several mechanisms have been proposed to explain how large [[batholith]]s have been emplaced:\n* [[Stoping (geology)|Stoping]], where the granite cracks the wall rocks and pushes upwards as it removes blocks of the overlying crust\n* Assimilation, where the granite melts its way up into the crust and removes overlying material in this way\n* Inflation, where the granite body inflates under pressure and is injected into position\n\nMost geologists today accept that a combination of these phenomena can be used to explain granite intrusions, and that not all granites can be explained entirely by one or another mechanism.\n\n==Weathering==\n{{further|Weathering}}\n[[File:GrusSand.JPG|thumb|[[Grus (geology)|Grus]] sand and granitoid it derived from]]\n[[Physical weathering]] occurs on a large scale in the form of [[exfoliation joint]]s, which are the result of granite's expanding and fracturing as pressure is relieved when overlying material is removed by erosion or other processes.\n\n[[Chemical weathering]] of granite occurs when dilute [[carbonic acid]], and other acids present in rain and soil waters, [[mineral alteration|alter]] feldspar in a process called [[weathering|hydrolysis]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.ucl.ac.uk/earth-sciences/impact/geology/london/citycemetery/weathering/granite |title=Granite [Weathering] |work=[[University College London]] |accessdate=10 July 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141015040859/http://www.ucl.ac.uk/earth-sciences/impact/geology/london/citycemetery/weathering/granite |archive-date=15 October 2014 |url-status=dead }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.geolsoc.org.uk/ks3/gsl/education/resources/rockcycle/page3566.html |title= Hydrolysis |work=[[Geological Society of London]] |accessdate=10 July 2014 }}</ref> As demonstrated in the following reaction, this causes potassium feldspar to form [[kaolinite]], with potassium ions, bicarbonate, and silica in solution as byproducts.

By contrast, more mafic rocks, such as tonalite, [[gabbro]] and [[diorite]], have 1 to 5 ppm uranium, and [[limestone]]s and [[sedimentary]] rocks usually have equally low amounts. Many large granite plutons are sources for [[palaeochannel]]-hosted or roll front [[uranium ore deposits]], where the uranium washes into the [[sediment]]s from the granite uplands and associated, often highly radioactive pegmatites.

Until the early 18th century, in the Western world, granite could be carved only by hand tools with generally poor results.\n\nA key breakthrough was the invention of steam-powered cutting and dressing tools by Alexander MacDonald of [[Aberdeen]], inspired by seeing ancient Egyptian granite carvings. In 1832, the first polished tombstone of Aberdeen granite to be erected in an English cemetery was installed at [[Kensal Green Cemetery]]. It caused a sensation in the London monumental trade and for some years all polished granite ordered came from MacDonald's.<ref>Friends of West Norwood Cemetery newsletter 71 [http://www.fownc.org/pdf/newsletter73.pdf Alexander MacDonald (1794\u20131860) \u2013 Stonemason],</ref> As a result of the work of sculptor William Leslie, and later Sidney Field, granite memorials became a major status symbol in Victorian Britain.

[[Aberdeen]] in Scotland, which is constructed principally from local granite, is known as \"The Granite City\". Because of its abundance in [[New England]], granite was commonly used to build foundations for homes there. The [[Granite Railway]], America's first railroad, was built to haul granite from the quarries in [[Quincy, Massachusetts]], to the [[Neponset River]] in the 1820s.\n\n====Engineering====\n[[Engineers]] have traditionally used polished granite [[surface plate]]s to establish a [[plane (mathematics)|plane]] of reference, since they are relatively impervious, inflexible, and maintain good dimensional stability. Sandblasted [[concrete]] with a heavy [[Aggregate (geology)|aggregate]] content has an appearance similar to rough granite, and is often used as a substitute when use of real granite is impractical. Granite tables are used extensively as bases or even as the entire structural body of optical instruments, [[Coordinate-measuring machine|CMM]]<nowiki/>s, and very high precision CNC machines because of granite's rigidity, high dimensional stability, and excellent vibration characteristics. A most unusual use of granite was as the material of the tracks of the [[Haytor Granite Tramway]], Devon, England, in 1820. Granite block is usually processed into slabs, which can be cut and shaped by a [[cutting center]]. In military engineering, Finland planted granite boulders along its [[Mannerheim Line]] to block invasion by Russian tanks in the winter war of 1940.\n\n====Other uses====\n[[Curling]] stones are traditionally fashioned of Ailsa Craig granite. The first stones were made in the 1750s, the original source being [[Ailsa Craig]] in [[Scotland]]. Because of the rarity of this granite, the best stones can cost as much as US$1,500. Between 60 and 70 percent of the stones used today are made from Ailsa Craig granite, although the island is now a wildlife reserve and is still used for quarrying under license for Ailsa granite by [[Kays of Scotland]] for curling stones.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2004/10/1027_041027_curling_stones.html |title=National Geographic News&nbsp;\u2014 Puffins Return to Scottish Island Famous for Curling Stones |publisher=National Geographic News|author=Roach, John |date=October 27, 2004}}</ref>\n\n==Rock climbing==\nGranite is one of the rocks most prized by climbers, for its steepness, soundness, crack systems, and friction.

Granites can be predominantly white, pink, or gray in color, depending on their [[mineralogy]]. The word \"granite\" comes from the [[Latin]] ''granum'', a grain, in reference to the coarse-grained structure of such a [[holocrystalline|completely crystalline]] rock. Strictly speaking, granite is an igneous rock with between 20% and 60% [[quartz]] by volume, and at least 35% of the total feldspar consisting of [[alkali feldspar]], although commonly the term \"granite\" is used to refer to a wider range of coarse-grained igneous rocks containing quartz and feldspar.\n\nThe term \"granitic\" means granite-like and is applied to granite and a group of intrusive igneous rocks with similar textures and slight variations in composition and origin. These rocks mainly consist of [[feldspar]], [[quartz]], [[mica]], and [[amphibole]] [[mineral]]s, which form an interlocking, somewhat [[equigranular]] [[Matrix (geology)|matrix]] of feldspar and quartz with scattered darker [[biotite]] mica and amphibole (often [[hornblende]]) peppering the lighter color minerals. Occasionally some individual crystals ([[phenocryst]]s) are larger than the [[groundmass]], in which case the texture is known as [[porphyritic]]. A granitic rock with a porphyritic texture is known as a granite [[Porphyry (geology)|porphyry]]. [[Granitoid]] is a general, descriptive [[Field research|field]] term for lighter-colored, coarse-grained igneous rocks. [[Petrography|Petrographic]] examination is required for identification of specific types of granitoids.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://geology.about.com/od/more_igrocks/a/granitoids.htm |title=Granitoids \u2013 Granite and the Related Rocks Granodiorite, Diorite and Tonalite |publisher=Geology.about.com |date=2010-02-06 |accessdate=2010-05-09}}</ref> The [[extrusive]] igneous rock equivalent of granite is [[rhyolite]].<ref name=\"Haldar2014\">{{cite book | title=Introduction to Mineralogy and Petrology | publisher=Elsevier |author1=Haldar, S.K.  |author2=Ti\u0161ljar, J. | year=2014 | page=116 | isbn=978-0-12-408133-8}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Granite under Polarized light.jpg|thumb|A microscopic picture of granite]]\nGranite is nearly always massive (i.e., lacking any internal structures), hard, and tough.

[[Outcrop]]s of granite tend to form [[tor (rock formation)|tors]] and rounded [[massif]]s. Granites sometimes occur in circular [[depression (geology)|depression]]s surrounded by a range of hills, formed by the [[metamorphic aureole]] or [[hornfels]]. Granite often occurs as relatively small, less than 100&nbsp;km<sup>2</sup> stock masses ([[stock (geology)|stocks]]) and in [[batholith]]s that are often associated with [[orogeny|orogenic]] [[mountain]] ranges. Small [[dike (geology)|dikes]] of granitic composition called [[aplite]]s are often associated with the margins of granitic [[intrusion (geology)|intrusion]]s. In some locations, very coarse-grained [[pegmatite]] masses occur with granite.\n\n==Origin==\n[https://www.draughtsmancivilnotes.in/2020/04/classification-of-rocks.html Granite] has a felsic composition and is more common in continental crust than in oceanic crust. They are crystallized from felsic melts which are less dense than mafic rocks and thus tend to ascend toward the surface. In contrast, mafic rocks, either basalts or gabbros, once metamorphosed at eclogite facies, tend to sink into the mantle beneath the [[Mohorovi\u010di\u0107 discontinuity|Moho]].\n\n===Petrogenetic mechanism===\nGranitoids have crystallized from felsic magmas that have compositions at or near a eutectic point (or a temperature minimum on a cotectic curve). Magmas are composed of melts and minerals in variable abundances. Traditionally, magmatic minerals are crystallized from the melts that have completely separated from their parental rocks and thus are highly evolved because of igneous differentiation. If a granite has a slowly cooling process, it has the potential to form larger crystals.\n\nThere are also peritectic and residual minerals in granitic magmas. Peritectic minerals are generated through peritectic reactions, whereas residual minerals are inherited from parental rocks. In either case, magmas will evolve to the eutectic for crystallization upon cooling. Anatectic melts are also produced by peritectic reactions, but they are much less evolved than magmatic melts because they have not separated from their parental rocks. Nevertheless, the composition of anatectic melts may change toward the magmatic melts through high-degree fractional crystallization.\n\nFractional crystallisation serves to reduce a melt in iron, magnesium, titanium, calcium and sodium, and enrich the melt in potassium and silicon \u2013 alkali feldspar (rich in potassium) and quartz (SiO2), are two of the defining constituents of granite. This process operates regardless of the origin of parental magmas to granites, and regardless of their chemistry.\n\n===Alphabet classification system===\nThe composition and origin of any magma that differentiates into granite leave certain petrological evidence as to what the granite's parental rock was. The final texture and composition of a granite are generally distinctive as to its parental rock. For instance, a granite that is derived from partial melting of metasedimentary rocks may have more alkali feldspar, whereas a granite derived from partial melting of metaigneous rocks may be richer in plagioclase. It is on this basis that the modern \"alphabet\" classification schemes are based.\n\nThe letter-based Chappell & White classification system was proposed initially to divide granites into [[I-type granite|I-type]] (igneous source) granite and S-type (sedimentary sources).<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Chappell |first1=B. W. |last2=White |first2=A. J. R. |title=Two contrasting granite types: 25 years later |journal=Australian Journal of Earth Sciences |date=2001 |volume=48 |issue=4 |pages=489\u2013499 |doi=10.1046/j.1440-0952.2001.00882.x}}</ref> Both types are produced by partial melting of crustal rocks, either metaigneous rocks or metasedimentary rocks.\n\nM-type granite was later proposed to cover those granites that were clearly sourced from crystallized mafic magmas, generally sourced from the mantle. However, this proposal has been rejected by studies of experimental petrology, which demonstrate that partial melting of mantle [[peridotite]] cannot produce granitic melts in any case. Although the fractional crystallisation of basaltic melts can yield small amounts of granites, such granites must occur together with large amounts of basaltic rocks.\n\nA-type granites were defined as to occur in anorogenic setting, have alkaline and anhydrous compositions. They show a peculiar mineralogy and geochemistry, with particularly high silicon and potassium at the expense of calcium and magnesium.<ref>Winter, J.D. (2010) Principles of Igneous and Metamorphic Petrology. 2nd Edition, page 381.</ref> These granites are produced by partial melting of refractory lithology such as granulites in the lower continental crust at high thermal gradients. This leads to significant extraction of hydrous felsic melts from granulite-facies resitites. A-type granites occur in the Koettlitz Glacier Alkaline Province in the Royal Society Range, Antarctica. The rhyolites of the Yellowstone Caldera are examples of volcanic equivalents of A-type granite.\n\nH-type granites were suggested for hybrid granites, which were hypothesized to form by mixing between mafic and felsic from different sources, e.g. M-type and S-type. However, the big difference in rheology between mafic and felsic magmas makes this process hardly happening in nature.\n\n===Granitization===\nAn old, and largely discounted process, granitization states that granite is formed in place through extreme metasomatism by fluids bringing in elements, e.g. potassium, and removing others, e.g. calcium, to transform a metamorphic rock into a granite. This was supposed to occur across a migrating front.\n\nAfter more than 50 years of studies, it becomes clear that granitic magmas have separated from their sources and experienced fractional crystallization during their ascent toward the surface. On the other hand, granitic melts can be produced in place through the partial melting of metamorphic rocks by extracting melt-mobile elements such as potassium and silicon into the melts but leaving others such as calcium and iron in granulite residues. Once a metamorphic rock is melted, it becomes a kind of migmatites which are composed of leucosome and melanosome.\n\nIn nature, metamorphic rocks may undergo partial melting to transform into migmatites through peritectic reactions, with anatectic melts to crystallize as leucosomes. As soon as the anatectic melts have separated from their sources and highly evolved through fractional crystallization during their ascent toward the surface, they become the magmatic melts and minerals of granitic composition.\n\nAfter the extraction of anatectic melts, the migmatites become a kind of granulites. In all cases, the partial melting of solid rocks requires high temperatures, and also water or other volatiles which act as a catalyst by lowering the solidus temperature of these rocks. The production of granite at crustal depths requires high heat flow, which cannot be provided by heat production elements in the crust. Furthermore, high heat flow is necessary to produce granulite facies metamorphic rocks in orogens, indicating extreme metamorphism at high thermal gradients. In-situ granitisation by the extreme metamorphism is possible if crustal rocks would be heated by the asthenospheric mantle in rifting orogens, where collision-thickened orogenic lithosphere is thinned at first and then underwent extensional tectonism for active rifting.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Zheng |first1=Y.-F. |last2=Chen |first2=R.-X. |title=Regional metamorphism at extreme conditions: Implications for orogeny at convergent plate margins |journal=Journal of Asian Earth Sciences |date=2017 |volume=145 |pages=46\u201373 |doi=10.1016/j.jseaes.2017.03.009}}</ref>\n\n==Ascent and emplacement==\nThe ascent and emplacement of large volumes of granite within the upper continental crust is a source of much debate amongst geologists. There is a lack of field evidence for any proposed mechanisms, so hypotheses are predominantly based upon experimental data. There are two major hypotheses for the ascent of magma through the crust:\n\n*Stokes [[diapir]]\n*[[Fracture (geology)|Fracture propagation]]\n\nOf these two mechanisms, Stokes diapir was favoured for many years in the absence of a reasonable alternative. The basic idea is that magma will rise through the crust as a single mass through [[buoyancy]]. As it rises, it heats the [[Country rock (geology)|wall rocks]], causing them to behave as a [[power-law fluid]] and thus flow around the [[pluton]] allowing it to pass rapidly and without major heat loss.<ref>{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1029/93JB03461| title = Diapiric ascent of magmas through power law crust and mantle| journal = Journal of Geophysical Research| volume = 99| issue = B5| page = 9543| year = 1994| last1 = Weinberg | first1 = R.

Rocks there do not deform so easily: for magma to rise as a pluton it would expend far too much energy in heating wall rocks, thus cooling and solidifying before reaching higher levels within the crust.\n\n[[Fracture (geology)|Fracture]] propagation is the mechanism preferred by many geologists as it largely eliminates the major problems of moving a huge mass of magma through cold brittle crust. Magma rises instead in small channels along self-propagating [[Dike (geology)|dykes]] which form along new or pre-existing fracture or [[fault (geology)|fault]] systems and networks of active shear zones.<ref>{{cite journal|title=Observations on the origins and ascent mechanisms of granitic magmas|journal=Journal of the Geological Society of London|year=1998|first=John|last=Clemens|volume=155|issue=Part 5|pages=843\u201351 | doi = 10.1144/gsjgs.155.5.0843 |url=http://eprints.kingston.ac.uk/2904/|bibcode=1998JGSoc.155..843C}}</ref> As these narrow conduits open, the first magma to enter solidifies and provides a form of insulation for later magma.\n\nGranitic magma must make room for itself or be intruded into other rocks in order to form an intrusion, and several mechanisms have been proposed to explain how large [[batholith]]s have been emplaced:\n* [[Stoping (geology)|Stoping]], where the granite cracks the wall rocks and pushes upwards as it removes blocks of the overlying crust\n* Assimilation, where the granite melts its way up into the crust and removes overlying material in this way\n* Inflation, where the granite body inflates under pressure and is injected into position\n\nMost geologists today accept that a combination of these phenomena can be used to explain granite intrusions, and that not all granites can be explained entirely by one or another mechanism.\n\n==Weathering==\n{{further|Weathering}}\n[[File:GrusSand.JPG|thumb|[[Grus (geology)|Grus]] sand and granitoid it derived from]]\n[[Physical weathering]] occurs on a large scale in the form of [[exfoliation joint]]s, which are the result of granite's expanding and fracturing as pressure is relieved when overlying material is removed by erosion or other processes.\n\n[[Chemical weathering]] of granite occurs when dilute [[carbonic acid]], and other acids present in rain and soil waters, [[mineral alteration|alter]] feldspar in a process called [[weathering|hydrolysis]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.ucl.ac.uk/earth-sciences/impact/geology/london/citycemetery/weathering/granite |title=Granite [Weathering] |work=[[University College London]] |accessdate=10 July 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141015040859/http://www.ucl.ac.uk/earth-sciences/impact/geology/london/citycemetery/weathering/granite |archive-date=15 October 2014 |url-status=dead }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.geolsoc.org.uk/ks3/gsl/education/resources/rockcycle/page3566.html |title= Hydrolysis |work=[[Geological Society of London]] |accessdate=10 July 2014 }}</ref> As demonstrated in the following reaction, this causes potassium feldspar to form [[kaolinite]], with potassium ions, bicarbonate, and silica in solution as byproducts.

Many large granite plutons are sources for [[palaeochannel]]-hosted or roll front [[uranium ore deposits]], where the uranium washes into the [[sediment]]s from the granite uplands and associated, often highly radioactive pegmatites. Cellars and basements built into soils over granite can become a trap for [[radon]] gas,{{citation needed|date=October 2018}} which is formed by the decay of uranium.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.world-nuclear.org/images/info/decayseries.gif |title=Decay series of Uranium |accessdate=2008-10-19 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120309161714/http://www.world-nuclear.org/images/info/decayseries.gif |archivedate=March 9, 2012 }}</ref> Radon gas poses significant health concerns and is the number two cause of [[lung cancer]] in the US behind smoking.<ref name=\"cancer1\">{{cite web|url=http://www.cancer.gov/cancerTopics/factsheet/Risk/radon|title=Radon and Cancer: Questions and Answers|publisher=National Cancer Institute|accessdate=2008-10-19}}</ref>\n\n[[Thorium]] occurs in all granites.<ref>Hubbert, M.

Granite became \"an integral part of the Roman language of monumental architecture\".<ref name=a/> The quarrying ceased around the third century AD. Beginning in Late Antiquity the granite was reused, which since at least the early 16th century became known as [[spoliation]]. Through the process of [[Case hardening of rocks|case-hardening]], granite becomes harder with age. The technology required to make [[tempered steel]] chisels was largely forgotten during the Middle Ages. As a result, Medieval stoneworkers were forced to use saws or emery to shorten ancient columns or hack them into discs. [[Giorgio Vasari]] noted in the 16th century that granite in quarries was \"far softer and easier to work than after it has lain exposed\" while ancient columns, because of their \"hardness and solidity have nothing to fear from fire or sword, and time itself, that drives everything to ruin, not only has not destroyed them but has not even altered their colour.\"<ref name=a>{{cite journal |last1= Waters|first1= Michael|date= 2016|title= Reviving Antiquity with Granite: Spolia and the Development of Roman Renaissance Architecture|journal=Architectural History |volume=59 |issue= |pages=149\u2013179 |doi= 10.1017/arh.2016.5|doi-access= free}}</ref>\n\n===Modern===\n\n====Sculpture and memorials====\n[[File:various granites.jpg|thumb|upright=1.5|Various granites (cut and polished surfaces)]]\n\nIn some areas, granite is used for gravestones and memorials. Granite is a hard stone and requires skill to carve by hand. Until the early 18th century, in the Western world, granite could be carved only by hand tools with generally poor results.\n\nA key breakthrough was the invention of steam-powered cutting and dressing tools by Alexander MacDonald of [[Aberdeen]], inspired by seeing ancient Egyptian granite carvings. In 1832, the first polished tombstone of Aberdeen granite to be erected in an English cemetery was installed at [[Kensal Green Cemetery]]. It caused a sensation in the London monumental trade and for some years all polished granite ordered came from MacDonald's.<ref>Friends of West Norwood Cemetery newsletter 71 [http://www.fownc.org/pdf/newsletter73.pdf Alexander MacDonald (1794\u20131860) \u2013 Stonemason],</ref> As a result of the work of sculptor William Leslie, and later Sidney Field, granite memorials became a major status symbol in Victorian Britain. The royal sarcophagus at [[Frogmore#Royal Mausoleum (or 'Frogmore Mausoleum')|Frogmore]] was probably the pinnacle of its work, and at 30 tons one of the largest. It was not until the 1880s that rival machinery and works could compete with the MacDonald works.\n\nModern methods of carving include using computer-controlled rotary bits and [[sandblasting]] over a rubber stencil. Leaving the letters, numbers, and emblems exposed on the stone, the blaster can create virtually any kind of artwork or epitaph.\n\nThe stone known as \"black granite\" is usually [[gabbro]], which has a completely different chemical composition.<ref name=graniteland>{{cite web|title=Black granite and black marble|url=http://www.graniteland.com/stone/color/black|work=Trade Brochure|publisher=Graniteland.com|accessdate=21 May 2014}}</ref>\n\n====Buildings====\nGranite has been extensively used as a [[dimension stone]] and as flooring tiles in public and commercial buildings and monuments. [[Aberdeen]] in Scotland, which is constructed principally from local granite, is known as \"The Granite City\". Because of its abundance in [[New England]], granite was commonly used to build foundations for homes there. The [[Granite Railway]], America's first railroad, was built to haul granite from the quarries in [[Quincy, Massachusetts]], to the [[Neponset River]] in the 1820s.\n\n====Engineering====\n[[Engineers]] have traditionally used polished granite [[surface plate]]s to establish a [[plane (mathematics)|plane]] of reference, since they are relatively impervious, inflexible, and maintain good dimensional stability. Sandblasted [[concrete]] with a heavy [[Aggregate (geology)|aggregate]] content has an appearance similar to rough granite, and is often used as a substitute when use of real granite is impractical. Granite tables are used extensively as bases or even as the entire structural body of optical instruments, [[Coordinate-measuring machine|CMM]]<nowiki/>s, and very high precision CNC machines because of granite's rigidity, high dimensional stability, and excellent vibration characteristics. A most unusual use of granite was as the material of the tracks of the [[Haytor Granite Tramway]], Devon, England, in 1820. Granite block is usually processed into slabs, which can be cut and shaped by a [[cutting center]]. In military engineering, Finland planted granite boulders along its [[Mannerheim Line]] to block invasion by Russian tanks in the winter war of 1940.\n\n====Other uses====\n[[Curling]] stones are traditionally fashioned of Ailsa Craig granite. The first stones were made in the 1750s, the original source being [[Ailsa Craig]] in [[Scotland]]. Because of the rarity of this granite, the best stones can cost as much as US$1,500. Between 60 and 70 percent of the stones used today are made from Ailsa Craig granite, although the island is now a wildlife reserve and is still used for quarrying under license for Ailsa granite by [[Kays of Scotland]] for curling stones.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2004/10/1027_041027_curling_stones.html |title=National Geographic News&nbsp;\u2014 Puffins Return to Scottish Island Famous for Curling Stones |publisher=National Geographic News|author=Roach, John |date=October 27, 2004}}</ref>\n\n==Rock climbing==\nGranite is one of the rocks most prized by climbers, for its steepness, soundness, crack systems, and friction. Well-known venues for granite climbing include the [[Yosemite Valley]], the [[The Bugaboos|Bugaboos]], the [[Mont Blanc]] massif (and peaks such as the [[Aiguille du Dru]], the [[Mourne Mountains]], the [[Adamello-Presanella Alps]], the [[Aiguille du Midi]] and the [[Grandes Jorasses]]), the [[Bregaglia Range|Bregaglia]], [[Corsica]], parts of the [[Karakoram]] (especially the [[Trango Towers]]), the Fitzroy Massif, [[Patagonia]], [[Baffin Island]], [[Ogawayama]], the [[Geography of Cornwall|Cornish coast]], the [[Cairngorms]], [[Sugarloaf Mountain]] in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, and the [[Stawamus Chief]], British Columbia, Canada.\n\nGranite [[rock climbing]] is so popular that many of the artificial rock [[climbing wall]]s found in gyms and theme parks are made to look and feel like granite.\n\n<gallery widths=\"200px\" heights=\"160px\">\nFile:St. Louis wharf cobbles 20090121 1.jpg|Granite was used for [[setts]] on the [[St. Louis]] [[Mississippi River|riverfront]] and for the piers of the [[Eads Bridge]] (background)\nFile:Torres del Paine, Patagonia (2004).jpg|The granite peaks of the [[Cordillera Paine]] in the [[Chile]]an [[Patagonia]]\nFile:Yosemite 20 bg 090404.jpg|[[Half Dome]], [[Yosemite National Park]], a classic [[granitic dome]] and popular rock climbing destination\nFile:Rix\u00f6 granitbrott 4.jpg|Rix\u00f6 red granite quarry in [[Lysekil]], Sweden\nFile:Liberty Bell Mountain seen from Highway 20.jpg|[[Liberty Bell Mountain]] in the [[North Cascades]]\nFile:Early Winters Spires.jpg|[[Early Winters Spires]] in the [[North Cascades]]\n</gallery>\n\n==See also==\n{{div col|colwidth=35em}}\n* {{annotated link|Cheyenne Mountain Complex}}\n* {{annotated link|Epoxy granite}}\n* {{annotated link|Exfoliating granite}}\n* {{annotated link|Falkenfelsen|aka=Falcon Rock}}\n* {{annotated link|Fall River granite}}\n* {{annotated link|Greisen}}\n* {{annotated link|Hypersolvus}}\n* {{annotated link|Igneous rock}}\n* {{annotated link|Kashmir gold}}\n* {{annotated link|List of rock types}}\n* {{annotated link|Luxullianite}}\n* {{annotated link|Mourne Mountains}}\n* {{annotated link|Orbicular granite}}\n* {{annotated link|Pikes Peak granite}}, [[Colorado]]\n* {{annotated link|Quartz monzonite}}\n* {{annotated link|Rapakivi granite}}\n* {{annotated link|Stone Mountain}}, [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]]\n* {{annotated link|Subsolvus}}\n* {{annotated link|Wicklow Mountains}}, [[Ireland]]\n{{div col end}}\n\n==References==\n;Notes\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n==Further reading==\n* {{Cite book |editor1=Blasik, Miroslava |editor2=Hanika, Bogdashka |year=2012|title=Granite: Occurrence, Mineralogy and Origin|location=Hauppauge, New York|publisher=Nova Science |isbn=978-1-62081-566-3}}\n* {{Cite book |author=Twidale, Charles Rowland|author-link=Charles Rowland Twidale|year=2005|title=Landforms and Geology of Granite Terrains|location=Leiden, Netherlands|publisher=A.

It is the finest grained foliated metamorphic rock.<ref name=EG>Essentials of Geology, 3rd Ed, Stephen Marshak</ref> Foliation may not correspond to the original sedimentary layering, but instead is in planes perpendicular to the direction of metamorphic compression.<ref name=EG/>\n\nThe foliation in slate is called \"[[slaty cleavage]]\".<ref name=EG/> It is caused by strong compression causing fine grained clay flakes to regrow in planes perpendicular to the compression.<ref name=EG/> When expertly \"cut\" by striking parallel to the foliation, with a specialized tool in the quarry, many slates will display a property called [[fissility (geology)|fissility]], forming smooth flat sheets of stone which have long been used for [[roof]]ing, floor tiles, and other purposes.<ref name=EG/> Slate is frequently grey in color, especially when seen, en masse, covering roofs. However, slate occurs in a variety of colors even from a single locality; for example, slate from [[North Wales]] can be found in many shades of grey, from pale to dark, and may also be [[purple]], [[green]] or [[cyan]]. Slate is not to be confused with [[shale]], from which it may be formed, or [[schist]].\n\nThe word \"slate\" is also used for certain types of object made from slate rock. It may mean a single roofing tile made of slate, or a [[Slate (writing)|writing slate]]. They were traditionally a small, smooth piece of the rock, often framed in wood, used with chalk as a notepad or notice board, and especially for recording charges in pubs and inns. The phrases \"clean slate\" and \"[[tabula rasa|blank slate]]\" come from this usage.\n\n==Historical mining terminology==\nBefore the mid-19th century, the terms ''slate'', ''shale'' and ''schist'' were not sharply distinguished.<ref>R. W. Raymond, Slate, [https://books.google.com/books?id=FpqFAAAAIAAJ&pg=PA78 A Glossary of Mining and Metallurgical Terms], American Institute of Mining Engineers, 1881; page 78.</ref> In the context of underground [[coal mining]] in the United States, the term slate was commonly used to refer to shale well into the 20th century.<ref>Albert H.

Occasionally, as in the purple slates of [[Slate industry in Wales|North Wales]], ferrous reduction spheres form around iron nuclei, leaving a light green spotted texture. These spheres are sometimes deformed by a subsequent applied stress field to ovoids, which appear as ellipses when viewed on a [[Cleavage (geology)|cleavage plane]] of the specimen.\n\n==Uses==\n[[File:St Fagans Tannery 7.jpg|thumb|Slate roof]]\n\n===Slate in buildings===\n[[File:Kirche wurzbach.jpg|thumb|Slate-faced church and homes in [[Wurzbach]], [[Th\u00fcringen]], Germany]]\n[[File:St.leonhard-ffm002.jpg|thumb|upright|Fine slate tile work, Saint Leonhard's Church, [[Frankfurt am Main]], Germany.]]\nSlate can be made into roofing slates, a type of [[roof shingle]], or more specifically a type of [[roof tile]], which are installed by a [[slater]]. Slate has two lines of breakability \u2013 cleavage and grain \u2013 which make it possible to split the stone into thin sheets. When broken, slate retains a natural appearance while remaining relatively flat and easy to stack. A series of \"slate booms\" occurred in Europe from the 1870s until the [[World War I|First World War]] following improvements in railway, road and waterway transportation systems.<ref>Schunck, Eberhard, and Hans Jochen Oster. ''Roof Construction Manual Pitched Roofs''.. Basel: De Gruyter, 2003. 12. Print.</ref>\n\nSlate is particularly suitable as a roofing material as it has an extremely low water absorption index of less than 0.4%, making the material waterproof. In fact, this natural slate, which requires only minimal processing, has the lowest [[embodied energy]] of all roofing materials.\nNatural slate is used by building professionals as a result of its beauty and durability. Slate is incredibly durable and can last several hundred years, often with little or no maintenance. Its low water absorption makes it very resistant to frost damage and breakage due to freezing. Natural slate is also fire resistant and energy efficient.<ref>[http://www.insightmag.co.uk/newsarticle.asp?NewsID=286 Natural Slate, the natural option] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140310123813/http://www.insightmag.co.uk/newsarticle.asp?NewsID=286 |date=10 March 2014 }}</ref>\n[[File:SlateTremedda.jpg|thumb|left|Slates with holes for fixing, viewed from below. Photographed in [[Tremedda]], [[Cornwall]], a farm in England]]\n\nSlate roof tiles are usually fixed (fastened) either with nails, or with hooks as is common with Spanish slate. In the UK, fixing is typically with double nails onto timber battens (England and Wales) or nailed directly onto timber sarking boards (Scotland and Northern Ireland). Nails were traditionally of copper, although there are modern alloy and stainless steel alternatives. Both these methods, if used properly, provide a long-lasting weathertight roof with a lifespan of around 80\u2013100 years. \n\nSome mainland European slate suppliers suggest that using hook fixing means that:<ref>[http://www.spanishslateuk.com/hook_fixing.asp Galician and Spanish Slate website \"Hook Fixing\"]. Retrieved on 26 January 2010 [https://web.archive.org/web/20110716113747/http://www.spanishslateuk.com/hook_fixing.asp archived]</ref>\n* Areas of weakness on the tile are fewer since no holes have to be drilled\n* Roofing features such as valleys and domes are easier to create since narrow tiles can be used\n* Hook fixing is particularly suitable in regions subject to severe weather conditions, since there is greater resistance to wind uplift, as the lower edge of the slate is secured.\n\nThe metal hooks are, however, visible and may be unsuitable for historic properties.\n\nSlate tiles are often used for interior and exterior flooring, stairs, walkways and wall cladding. Tiles are installed and set on mortar and grouted along the edges. Chemical sealants are often used on tiles to improve durability and appearance, increase stain resistance, reduce [[efflorescence]], and increase or reduce surface smoothness. Tiles are often sold gauged, meaning that the back surface is ground for ease of installation. Slate flooring can be slippery when used in external locations subject to rain. Slate tiles were used in 19th century UK building construction (apart from roofs) and in slate quarrying areas such as [[Blaenau Ffestiniog]] and [[Bethesda, Wales|Bethesda]], [[Wales]] there are still many buildings wholly constructed of slate. Slates can also be set into walls to provide a rudimentary [[damp-proof membrane]]. Small offcuts are used as [[shim (engineering)|shims]] to level floor joists. In areas where slate is plentiful it is also used in pieces of various sizes for building walls and hedges, sometimes combined with other kinds of stone. In modern homes slate is often used as table coasters.\n\n===Other uses===\nBecause it is a good [[electrical insulator]] and [[fireproof]], it was used to construct early-20th-century [[electric switchboard]]s and [[relay]] controls for large [[electric motor]]s. Fine slate can also be used as a [[whetstone (tool)|whetstone]] to hone knives.\n\nDue to its thermal stability and chemical inertness, slate has been used for laboratory bench tops and for [[billiard table]] tops. In 18th- and 19th-century schools, slate was extensively used for [[Chalkboard|blackboards]] and individual [[Slate (writing)|writing slates]], for which slate or chalk pencils were used.\n\nIn areas where it is available, high-quality slate is used for [[tombstones]] and commemorative tablets. In some cases slate was used by the ancient [[Maya civilization]] to fashion [[Maya stelae|stelae]].\n\nSlate was the traditional material of choice for black [[Go (game)|Go]] stones in Japan.

However, slate occurs in a variety of colors even from a single locality; for example, slate from [[North Wales]] can be found in many shades of grey, from pale to dark, and may also be [[purple]], [[green]] or [[cyan]]. Slate is not to be confused with [[shale]], from which it may be formed, or [[schist]].\n\nThe word \"slate\" is also used for certain types of object made from slate rock. It may mean a single roofing tile made of slate, or a [[Slate (writing)|writing slate]]. They were traditionally a small, smooth piece of the rock, often framed in wood, used with chalk as a notepad or notice board, and especially for recording charges in pubs and inns. The phrases \"clean slate\" and \"[[tabula rasa|blank slate]]\" come from this usage.\n\n==Historical mining terminology==\nBefore the mid-19th century, the terms ''slate'', ''shale'' and ''schist'' were not sharply distinguished.<ref>R. W. Raymond, Slate, [https://books.google.com/books?id=FpqFAAAAIAAJ&pg=PA78 A Glossary of Mining and Metallurgical Terms], American Institute of Mining Engineers, 1881; page 78.</ref> In the context of underground [[coal mining]] in the United States, the term slate was commonly used to refer to shale well into the 20th century.<ref>Albert H.

Occasionally, as in the purple slates of [[Slate industry in Wales|North Wales]], ferrous reduction spheres form around iron nuclei, leaving a light green spotted texture. These spheres are sometimes deformed by a subsequent applied stress field to ovoids, which appear as ellipses when viewed on a [[Cleavage (geology)|cleavage plane]] of the specimen.\n\n==Uses==\n[[File:St Fagans Tannery 7.jpg|thumb|Slate roof]]\n\n===Slate in buildings===\n[[File:Kirche wurzbach.jpg|thumb|Slate-faced church and homes in [[Wurzbach]], [[Th\u00fcringen]], Germany]]\n[[File:St.leonhard-ffm002.jpg|thumb|upright|Fine slate tile work, Saint Leonhard's Church, [[Frankfurt am Main]], Germany.]]\nSlate can be made into roofing slates, a type of [[roof shingle]], or more specifically a type of [[roof tile]], which are installed by a [[slater]]. Slate has two lines of breakability \u2013 cleavage and grain \u2013 which make it possible to split the stone into thin sheets. When broken, slate retains a natural appearance while remaining relatively flat and easy to stack. A series of \"slate booms\" occurred in Europe from the 1870s until the [[World War I|First World War]] following improvements in railway, road and waterway transportation systems.<ref>Schunck, Eberhard, and Hans Jochen Oster. ''Roof Construction Manual Pitched Roofs''.. Basel: De Gruyter, 2003. 12. Print.</ref>\n\nSlate is particularly suitable as a roofing material as it has an extremely low water absorption index of less than 0.4%, making the material waterproof. In fact, this natural slate, which requires only minimal processing, has the lowest [[embodied energy]] of all roofing materials.\nNatural slate is used by building professionals as a result of its beauty and durability. Slate is incredibly durable and can last several hundred years, often with little or no maintenance. Its low water absorption makes it very resistant to frost damage and breakage due to freezing. Natural slate is also fire resistant and energy efficient.<ref>[http://www.insightmag.co.uk/newsarticle.asp?NewsID=286 Natural Slate, the natural option] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140310123813/http://www.insightmag.co.uk/newsarticle.asp?NewsID=286 |date=10 March 2014 }}</ref>\n[[File:SlateTremedda.jpg|thumb|left|Slates with holes for fixing, viewed from below. Photographed in [[Tremedda]], [[Cornwall]], a farm in England]]\n\nSlate roof tiles are usually fixed (fastened) either with nails, or with hooks as is common with Spanish slate. In the UK, fixing is typically with double nails onto timber battens (England and Wales) or nailed directly onto timber sarking boards (Scotland and Northern Ireland). Nails were traditionally of copper, although there are modern alloy and stainless steel alternatives. Both these methods, if used properly, provide a long-lasting weathertight roof with a lifespan of around 80\u2013100 years. \n\nSome mainland European slate suppliers suggest that using hook fixing means that:<ref>[http://www.spanishslateuk.com/hook_fixing.asp Galician and Spanish Slate website \"Hook Fixing\"]. Retrieved on 26 January 2010 [https://web.archive.org/web/20110716113747/http://www.spanishslateuk.com/hook_fixing.asp archived]</ref>\n* Areas of weakness on the tile are fewer since no holes have to be drilled\n* Roofing features such as valleys and domes are easier to create since narrow tiles can be used\n* Hook fixing is particularly suitable in regions subject to severe weather conditions, since there is greater resistance to wind uplift, as the lower edge of the slate is secured.\n\nThe metal hooks are, however, visible and may be unsuitable for historic properties.\n\nSlate tiles are often used for interior and exterior flooring, stairs, walkways and wall cladding. Tiles are installed and set on mortar and grouted along the edges. Chemical sealants are often used on tiles to improve durability and appearance, increase stain resistance, reduce [[efflorescence]], and increase or reduce surface smoothness. Tiles are often sold gauged, meaning that the back surface is ground for ease of installation. Slate flooring can be slippery when used in external locations subject to rain. Slate tiles were used in 19th century UK building construction (apart from roofs) and in slate quarrying areas such as [[Blaenau Ffestiniog]] and [[Bethesda, Wales|Bethesda]], [[Wales]] there are still many buildings wholly constructed of slate. Slates can also be set into walls to provide a rudimentary [[damp-proof membrane]]. Small offcuts are used as [[shim (engineering)|shims]] to level floor joists. In areas where slate is plentiful it is also used in pieces of various sizes for building walls and hedges, sometimes combined with other kinds of stone. In modern homes slate is often used as table coasters.\n\n===Other uses===\nBecause it is a good [[electrical insulator]] and [[fireproof]], it was used to construct early-20th-century [[electric switchboard]]s and [[relay]] controls for large [[electric motor]]s. Fine slate can also be used as a [[whetstone (tool)|whetstone]] to hone knives.\n\nDue to its thermal stability and chemical inertness, slate has been used for laboratory bench tops and for [[billiard table]] tops. In 18th- and 19th-century schools, slate was extensively used for [[Chalkboard|blackboards]] and individual [[Slate (writing)|writing slates]], for which slate or chalk pencils were used.\n\nIn areas where it is available, high-quality slate is used for [[tombstones]] and commemorative tablets. In some cases slate was used by the ancient [[Maya civilization]] to fashion [[Maya stelae|stelae]].\n\nSlate was the traditional material of choice for black [[Go (game)|Go]] stones in Japan.

Its major materials are the [[minerals]] [[calcite]] and [[aragonite]], which are different [[Polymorphism (materials science)|crystal forms]] of [[calcium carbonate]] (CaCO<sub>3</sub>). A closely related rock is [[Dolomite (rock)|dolomite]], which contains a high percentage of the mineral [[Dolomite (mineral)|dolomite]], CaMg(CO<sub>3</sub>)<sub>2</sub>. In old [[USGS]] publications, dolomite was referred to as ''magnesian limestone'', a term now reserved for magnesium-deficient dolomites or magnesium-rich limestones.\n\n[[File:Pamukkale 12.jpg|thumb|upright=1.25|[[Travertine]] limestone terraces of [[Pamukkale]], [[Turkey]].]]\n\nAbout 10% of sedimentary rocks are limestones.  The [[solubility]] of limestone in water and weak acid solutions leads to [[karst]] landscapes, in which water erodes the limestone over thousands to millions of years. Most [[cave]] systems are through limestone bedrock.\n\nLimestone has numerous uses: as a [[building material]], an essential component of [[concrete]] ([[Portland cement]]), as aggregate for the base of roads, as white pigment or filler in products such as [[toothpaste]] or [[paint]]s, as a chemical [[feedstock]] for the production of [[lime (material)|lime]], as a [[soil conditioner]], and as a popular decorative addition to [[rock gardens]].\n\n== Description ==\n[[File:Limestone Mines at Cedar Creek.jpg|thumb|Limestone quarry at [[Cedar Creek (North Fork Shenandoah River)|Cedar Creek, Virginia]], USA]]\n[[File:Gozo, limestone quarry - cutting the stone.JPG|thumb|Cutting limestone blocks at a quarry in [[Gozo]], [[Malta]]]]\n[[File:Kalkstein (nahe).JPG|thumb|left|upright|Limestone as building material]]\n[[File:La Zaplaz, Piatra Craiului.jpg|thumb|upright|La Zaplaz formations in the [[Piatra Craiului Mountains]], [[Romania]].]]\nLike most other sedimentary rocks, most limestone is composed of grains. Most grains in limestone are skeletal fragments of marine organisms such as [[coral]] or [[Foraminiferal Colouration Index|foraminifera]]. These organisms secrete shells made of [[aragonite]] or [[calcite]], and leave these shells behind when they die. Other [[carbonate]] grains composing limestones are [[ooids]], [[peloids]], [[intraclasts]], and [[extraclasts]].\n\nLimestone often contains variable amounts of [[silica]] in the form of [[chert]] ([[chalcedony]], [[flint]], [[jasper]], etc.) or siliceous skeletal fragment (sponge spicules, [[diatoms]], [[radiolarians]]), and [[travertine]] (a [[precipitate]] of calcite and aragonite). Secondary calcite may be deposited by [[Supersaturation|supersaturated]] [[meteoric water]]s ([[groundwater]] that precipitates the material in caves). This produces [[speleothem]]s, such as [[stalagmite]]s and [[stalactite]]s. Another form taken by calcite is oolitic limestone, which can be recognized by its granular (oolite) appearance.\n\nThe primary source of the calcite in limestone is most commonly [[marine biology|marine organisms]]. Some of these organisms can construct mounds of rock known as reefs, building upon past generations. Below about 3,000 meters, water pressure and temperature conditions cause the dissolution of calcite to increase nonlinearly, so limestone typically does not form in deeper waters (see [[lysocline]]). Limestones may also form in [[Lake|lacustrine]]<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Roeser|first=Patricia|last2=Franz|first2=Sven O.|last3=Litt|first3=Thomas|date=1 December 2016|title=Aragonite and calcite preservation in sediments from Lake Iznik related to bottom lake oxygenation and water column depth|journal=Sedimentology|language=en|volume=63|issue=7|pages=2253\u20132277|doi=10.1111/sed.12306|issn=1365-3091|df=}}</ref> and [[evaporite]] [[Sedimentary depositional environment|depositional environments]].<ref>{{cite journal |last=Trewin |first=N.

Crystals of calcite, [[quartz]], [[Dolomite (mineral)|dolomite]] or [[barite]] may line small cavities in the rock. When conditions are right for precipitation, calcite forms mineral coatings that cement the existing rock grains together, or it can fill fractures.\n\n[[Travertine]] is a banded, compact variety of limestone formed along streams, particularly where there are waterfalls and around hot or cold springs. Calcium carbonate is deposited where evaporation of the water leaves a solution supersaturated with the chemical constituents of calcite. [[Tufa]], a porous or cellular variety of travertine, is found near waterfalls. [[Coquina]] is a poorly consolidated limestone composed of pieces of [[coral]] or [[Animal shell|shells]].\n\nDuring regional [[metamorphism]] that occurs during the mountain building process ([[orogeny]]), limestone recrystallizes into [[marble]].\n\nLimestone is a [[parent material]] of [[Mollisol]] soil group.\n\n==Classification==\n{{See also|List of types of limestone}}\nTwo major classification schemes, the Folk and the Dunham, are used for identifying the types of [[carbonate rocks]] collectively known as [https://www.draughtsmancivilnotes.in/2020/04/classification-of-rocks.html limestone].\n\n[[File:JoultersCayOoids.jpg|thumb|[[Ooid]]s from a [[beach]] on Joulter's Cay, [[The Bahamas]] ]]\n[[File:Ooids Carmel Formation Jurassic.jpg|thumb|Ooids in limestone of the [[Carmel Formation]] (Middle Jurassic) of southwestern Utah.]]\n\n===Folk classification===\n{{main|Folk classification}}\nRobert L. Folk developed a classification system that places primary emphasis on the detailed composition of grains and interstitial material in [[carbonate rocks]].<ref>[http://sepmstrata.org/page.aspx?pageid=89  Carbonate Classification: SEPM STRATA]</ref> Based on composition, there are three main components: allochems (grains), matrix (mostly micrite), and cement (sparite). The Folk system uses two-part names; the first refers to the grains and the second is the root. It is helpful to have a [[petrographic microscope]] when using the Folk scheme, because it is easier to determine the components present in each sample.<ref name=\"Folk\">{{cite book |last=Folk |first=R. L. |year=1974 |title=Petrology of Sedimentary Rocks |publisher=Hemphill Publishing |location=Austin, Texas |isbn= }}</ref>\n\n===Dunham classification===\n{{main|Dunham classification}}\nThe Dunham scheme focuses on depositional textures. Each name is based upon the texture of the grains that make up the limestone. Robert J. Dunham published his system for limestone in 1962; it focuses on the depositional fabric of carbonate rocks. Dunham divides the rocks into four main groups based on relative proportions of coarser clastic particles. Dunham names are essentially for rock families. His work considers whether or not the grains were originally in mutual contact, and therefore self-supporting, or whether the rock is characterized by the presence of frame builders and algal mats. Unlike the Folk scheme, Dunham deals with the original porosity of the rock. The Dunham scheme is more useful for hand samples because it is based on texture, not the grains in the sample.<ref name=\"Dunham\">{{cite book |last=Dunham |first=R.

These include [[limestone pavement]]s, [[pot hole]]s, [[cenote]]s, caves and gorges.  Such erosion landscapes are known as [[karsts]].  Limestone is less [[resistance (geology)|resistant]] than most [[igneous]] rocks, but more resistant than most other [[sedimentary rock]]s.  It is therefore usually associated with hills and [[downland]], and occurs in regions with other sedimentary rocks, typically clays.\n\nKarst [[topography]] and caves develop in limestone rocks due to their [[solubility]] in dilute [[acid]]ic [[groundwater]].  The [[solubility]] of limestone in water and weak acid solutions leads to [[karst]] landscapes. Regions overlying limestone bedrock tend to have fewer visible above-ground sources (ponds and streams), as surface water easily drains downward through [[Joint (geology)|joints]] in the limestone. While draining, water and organic acid from the soil slowly (over thousands or millions of years) enlarges these cracks, dissolving the calcium carbonate and carrying it away in [[solution]]. Most [[cave]] systems are through limestone bedrock.  Cooling groundwater or mixing of different groundwaters will also create conditions suitable for cave formation.\n\nCoastal limestones are often eroded by organisms which bore into the rock by various means. This process is known as [[bioerosion]].  It is most common in the tropics, and it is known throughout the [[fossil record]] (see Taylor and Wilson, 2003).\n\nBands of limestone emerge from the Earth's surface in often spectacular rocky outcrops and islands. Examples include the [[Rock of Gibraltar]], the [[The Burren|Burren]] in County Clare, Ireland; the [[Verdon Gorge]] in France; [[Malham Cove]] in [[North Yorkshire]] and the [[Isle of Wight]],<ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.iwight.com/council/documents/policies_and_plans/udp/2002_pdfs/minerals.pdf| title=Isle of Wight, Minerals| accessdate=8 October 2006| url-status=dead| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061102184845/http://www.iwight.com/council/documents/policies_and_plans/udp/2002_pdfs/minerals.pdf| archivedate=2 November 2006}}</ref> England; the [[Great Orme]] in Wales; on [[F\u00e5r\u00f6]] near the Swedish island of [[Gotland]], the [[Niagara Escarpment]] in Canada/United States, [[Notch Peak]] in Utah, the [[Ha Long Bay]] National Park in Vietnam and the hills around the [[Lijiang River]] and [[Guilin]] city in China.\n\nThe [[Florida Keys]], islands off the south coast of [[Florida]], are composed mainly of [[oolite|oolitic]] limestone (the Lower Keys) and the carbonate skeletons of [[coral]] reefs (the Upper Keys), which thrived in the area during interglacial periods when sea level was higher than at present.\n\nUnique habitats are found on [[alvar]]s, extremely level expanses of limestone with thin soil mantles.  The largest such expanse in Europe is the [[Stora Alvaret]] on the island of [[\u00d6land]], Sweden. Another area with large quantities of limestone is the island of Gotland, Sweden.

So many buildings in [[Kingston, Ontario|Kingston]], [[Ontario]], Canada were, and continue to be, constructed from it that it is nicknamed the 'Limestone City'.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.citylifeontario.com/kingston/ |title= Welcome to the Limestone City |accessdate=13 February 2008 |url-status= live |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20080220171909/http://www.citylifeontario.com/kingston/ |archivedate= 20 February 2008 }}</ref> On the island of [[Malta]], a variety of limestone called Globigerina limestone was, for a long time, the only building material available, and is still very frequently used on all types of buildings and sculptures. Limestone is readily available and relatively easy to cut into blocks or more elaborate carving.<ref name=cassar/> Ancient American sculptors valued limestone because it was easy to work and good for fine detail. Going back to the Late Preclassic period (by 200\u2013100 BCE), the [[Maya civilization]] (Ancient Mexico) created refined sculpture using limestone because of these excellent carving properties. The Maya would decorate the ceilings of their sacred buildings (known as [[Ancient Maya art|lintels]]) and cover the walls with carved limestone panels. Carved on these sculptures were political and social stories, and this helped communicate messages of the king to his people.<ref>{{cite book|first1=Linda |last1=Schele |first2=Mary Ellen |last2=Miller |title=The Blood of Kings: Dynasty and Ritual in Maya Art |publisher=Kimbell Art Museum |page=41}}</ref> Limestone is long-lasting and stands up well to exposure, which explains why many limestone ruins survive. However, it is very heavy, making it impractical for tall buildings, and relatively expensive as a building material.\n[[File:Gizeh Cheops BW 1.jpg|thumb|The [[Great Pyramid of Giza]], one of the [[Seven Wonders of the Ancient World]] had an outside cover made entirely from limestone.]]\n[[File:Riley (Kansas) County Courthouse 1.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Riley County]] Courthouse built of limestone in [[Manhattan, Kansas]], USA]]\n[[File:Litography press with map of Moosburg 01.jpg|thumb|A limestone plate with a negative map of [[Moosburg]] in Bavaria is prepared for a [[lithography]] print.]]\nLimestone was most popular in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. Train stations, banks and other structures from that era were normally made of limestone. It is used as a facade on some skyscrapers, but only in thin plates for covering, rather than solid blocks. In the United States, Indiana, most notably the Bloomington area, has long been a source of high quality quarried limestone, called [[Indiana limestone]]. Many famous buildings in London are built from [[Portland limestone]].\n\nLimestone was also a very popular building block in the Middle Ages in the areas where it occurred, since it is hard, durable, and commonly occurs in easily accessible surface exposures. Many medieval churches and castles in Europe are made of limestone.  [[Beer stone]] was a popular kind of limestone for medieval buildings in southern England.\n\nLimestone and (to a lesser extent) marble are reactive to acid solutions, making [[acid rain]] a significant problem to the preservation of artifacts made from this stone. Many limestone statues and building surfaces have suffered severe damage due to acid rain. Likewise limestone gravel has been used to protect lakes vulnerable to acid rain, acting as a [[pH buffer]]ing agent.  Acid-based cleaning chemicals can also etch limestone, which should only be cleaned with a neutral or mild [[alkali]]-based cleaner.\n\nOther uses include:\n* It is the raw material for the manufacture of [[quicklime]] (calcium oxide), [[slaked lime]] (calcium hydroxide), [[cement]] and [[mortar (masonry)|mortar]].\n* Pulverized limestone is used as a soil conditioner to neutralize acidic soils ([[agricultural lime]]).\n* Is crushed for use as [[construction aggregate|aggregate]]\u2014the solid base for many roads as well as in [[asphalt concrete]].\n* [[Geological formation]]s of limestone are among the best [[petroleum reservoir]]s;\n* As a [[reagent]] in [[flue-gas desulfurization]], it reacts with [[sulfur dioxide]] for air pollution control.\n* [[Glass making]], in some circumstances, uses limestone.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=zNicdkuulE4C&pg=PA1387&dq=Glass+making,+in+some+circumstances,+uses+limestone.#v=onepage&q=Glass%20making,%20in%20some%20circumstances,%20uses%20limestone.&f=false|title=Industrial Minerals & Rocks: Commodities, Markets, and Uses|last=Kogel|first=Jessica Elzea|date=2006|publisher=SME|isbn=9780873352338|language=en|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171216222141/https://books.google.com/books?id=zNicdkuulE4C&pg=PA1387&dq=Glass+making,+in+some+circumstances,+uses+limestone.&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwi65Iu0yI_YAhVT22MKHWTfAWgQ6AEIKTAA#v=onepage&q=Glass%20making,%20in%20some%20circumstances,%20uses%20limestone.&f=false|archivedate=16 December 2017}}</ref>\n* It is added to toothpaste, paper, plastics, paint, tiles, and other materials as both white pigment and a cheap filler.\n* It can suppress methane explosions in underground coal mines.\n* Purified, it is added to bread and cereals as a source of calcium.\n* Calcium levels in livestock feed are supplemented with it, such as for poultry (when ground up).<ref>{{cite web|url= http://poultryone.com/articles/calcium.html|title= A Guide to Giving Your Layer Hens Enough Calcium|work= Poultry One|url-status= live|archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20090403082817/http://poultryone.com/articles/calcium.html|archivedate= 3 April 2009}}</ref>\n* It can be used for remineralizing and increasing the alkalinity of purified water to prevent pipe corrosion and to restore essential nutrient levels.<ref>{{cite web|url= http://www.who.int/water_sanitation_health/dwq/nutconsensus/en/|title= Nutrient minerals in drinking-water and the potential health consequences of consumption of demineralized and remineralized and altered mineral content drinking-water: Consensus of the meeting|work= World Health Organization report|url-status= live|archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20071224165953/http://www.who.int/water_sanitation_health/dwq/nutconsensus/en/|archivedate= 24 December 2007}}</ref>\n* Used in [[blast furnace]]s, limestone binds with silica and other impurities to remove them from the iron.\n* It is used in sculptures because of its suitability for carving.\n\n=== Occupational safety and health ===\nPeople can be exposed to limestone in the workplace by inhalation of and eye contact with the dust.\n\n====United States====\nThe [[Occupational Safety and Health Administration]] (OSHA) has set the legal limit ([[permissible exposure limit]]) for limestone exposure in the workplace as 15&nbsp;mg/m<sup>3</sup> total exposure and 5&nbsp;mg/m<sup>3</sup> respiratory exposure over an 8-hour workday.

Most [[cave]] systems are through limestone bedrock.\n\nLimestone has numerous uses: as a [[building material]], an essential component of [[concrete]] ([[Portland cement]]), as aggregate for the base of roads, as white pigment or filler in products such as [[toothpaste]] or [[paint]]s, as a chemical [[feedstock]] for the production of [[lime (material)|lime]], as a [[soil conditioner]], and as a popular decorative addition to [[rock gardens]].\n\n== Description ==\n[[File:Limestone Mines at Cedar Creek.jpg|thumb|Limestone quarry at [[Cedar Creek (North Fork Shenandoah River)|Cedar Creek, Virginia]], USA]]\n[[File:Gozo, limestone quarry - cutting the stone.JPG|thumb|Cutting limestone blocks at a quarry in [[Gozo]], [[Malta]]]]\n[[File:Kalkstein (nahe).JPG|thumb|left|upright|Limestone as building material]]\n[[File:La Zaplaz, Piatra Craiului.jpg|thumb|upright|La Zaplaz formations in the [[Piatra Craiului Mountains]], [[Romania]].]]\nLike most other sedimentary rocks, most limestone is composed of grains. Most grains in limestone are skeletal fragments of marine organisms such as [[coral]] or [[Foraminiferal Colouration Index|foraminifera]]. These organisms secrete shells made of [[aragonite]] or [[calcite]], and leave these shells behind when they die. Other [[carbonate]] grains composing limestones are [[ooids]], [[peloids]], [[intraclasts]], and [[extraclasts]].\n\nLimestone often contains variable amounts of [[silica]] in the form of [[chert]] ([[chalcedony]], [[flint]], [[jasper]], etc.) or siliceous skeletal fragment (sponge spicules, [[diatoms]], [[radiolarians]]), and [[travertine]] (a [[precipitate]] of calcite and aragonite). Secondary calcite may be deposited by [[Supersaturation|supersaturated]] [[meteoric water]]s ([[groundwater]] that precipitates the material in caves). This produces [[speleothem]]s, such as [[stalagmite]]s and [[stalactite]]s. Another form taken by calcite is oolitic limestone, which can be recognized by its granular (oolite) appearance.\n\nThe primary source of the calcite in limestone is most commonly [[marine biology|marine organisms]]. Some of these organisms can construct mounds of rock known as reefs, building upon past generations. Below about 3,000 meters, water pressure and temperature conditions cause the dissolution of calcite to increase nonlinearly, so limestone typically does not form in deeper waters (see [[lysocline]]). Limestones may also form in [[Lake|lacustrine]]<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Roeser|first=Patricia|last2=Franz|first2=Sven O.|last3=Litt|first3=Thomas|date=1 December 2016|title=Aragonite and calcite preservation in sediments from Lake Iznik related to bottom lake oxygenation and water column depth|journal=Sedimentology|language=en|volume=63|issue=7|pages=2253\u20132277|doi=10.1111/sed.12306|issn=1365-3091|df=}}</ref> and [[evaporite]] [[Sedimentary depositional environment|depositional environments]].<ref>{{cite journal |last=Trewin |first=N.

Calcite exhibits an unusual characteristic called [[Solubility#Temperature|retrograde solubility]], in which it becomes less soluble in water as the temperature increases.\n\nImpurities (such as [[clay]], sand, organic remains, [[iron oxide]], and other materials) will cause limestones to exhibit different colors, especially with [[Weathering|weathered]] surfaces.\n\nLimestone may be crystalline, [[Clastic rock|clastic]], granular, or massive, depending on the method of formation. Crystals of calcite, [[quartz]], [[Dolomite (mineral)|dolomite]] or [[barite]] may line small cavities in the rock. When conditions are right for precipitation, calcite forms mineral coatings that cement the existing rock grains together, or it can fill fractures.\n\n[[Travertine]] is a banded, compact variety of limestone formed along streams, particularly where there are waterfalls and around hot or cold springs. Calcium carbonate is deposited where evaporation of the water leaves a solution supersaturated with the chemical constituents of calcite. [[Tufa]], a porous or cellular variety of travertine, is found near waterfalls. [[Coquina]] is a poorly consolidated limestone composed of pieces of [[coral]] or [[Animal shell|shells]].\n\nDuring regional [[metamorphism]] that occurs during the mountain building process ([[orogeny]]), limestone recrystallizes into [[marble]].\n\nLimestone is a [[parent material]] of [[Mollisol]] soil group.\n\n==Classification==\n{{See also|List of types of limestone}}\nTwo major classification schemes, the Folk and the Dunham, are used for identifying the types of [[carbonate rocks]] collectively known as limestone.\n\n[[File:JoultersCayOoids.jpg|thumb|[[Ooid]]s from a [[beach]] on Joulter's Cay, [[The Bahamas]] ]]\n[[File:Ooids Carmel Formation Jurassic.jpg|thumb|Ooids in limestone of the [[Carmel Formation]] (Middle Jurassic) of southwestern Utah.]]\n\n===Folk classification===\n{{main|Folk classification}}\nRobert L. Folk developed a classification system that places primary emphasis on the detailed composition of grains and interstitial material in [[carbonate rocks]].<ref>[http://sepmstrata.org/page.aspx?pageid=89  Carbonate Classification: SEPM STRATA]</ref> Based on composition, there are three main components: allochems (grains), matrix (mostly micrite), and cement (sparite). The Folk system uses two-part names; the first refers to the grains and the second is the root. It is helpful to have a [[petrographic microscope]] when using the Folk scheme, because it is easier to determine the components present in each sample.<ref name=\"Folk\">{{cite book |last=Folk |first=R. L. |year=1974 |title=Petrology of Sedimentary Rocks |publisher=Hemphill Publishing |location=Austin, Texas |isbn= }}</ref>\n\n===Dunham classification===\n{{main|Dunham classification}}\nThe Dunham scheme focuses on depositional textures. Each name is based upon the texture of the grains that make up the limestone. Robert J. Dunham published his system for limestone in 1962; it focuses on the depositional fabric of carbonate rocks. Dunham divides the rocks into four main groups based on relative proportions of coarser clastic particles. Dunham names are essentially for rock families. His work considers whether or not the grains were originally in mutual contact, and therefore self-supporting, or whether the rock is characterized by the presence of frame builders and algal mats. Unlike the Folk scheme, Dunham deals with the original porosity of the rock. The Dunham scheme is more useful for hand samples because it is based on texture, not the grains in the sample.<ref name=\"Dunham\">{{cite book |last=Dunham |first=R.

These include [[limestone pavement]]s, [[pot hole]]s, [[cenote]]s, caves and gorges.  Such erosion landscapes are known as [[karsts]].  Limestone is less [[resistance (geology)|resistant]] than most [[igneous]] rocks, but more resistant than most other [[sedimentary rock]]s.  It is therefore usually associated with hills and [[downland]], and occurs in regions with other sedimentary rocks, typically clays.\n\nKarst [[topography]] and caves develop in limestone rocks due to their [[solubility]] in dilute [[acid]]ic [[groundwater]].  The [[solubility]] of limestone in water and weak acid solutions leads to [[karst]] landscapes. Regions overlying limestone bedrock tend to have fewer visible above-ground sources (ponds and streams), as surface water easily drains downward through [[Joint (geology)|joints]] in the limestone. While draining, water and organic acid from the soil slowly (over thousands or millions of years) enlarges these cracks, dissolving the calcium carbonate and carrying it away in [[solution]]. Most [[cave]] systems are through limestone bedrock.  Cooling groundwater or mixing of different groundwaters will also create conditions suitable for cave formation.\n\nCoastal limestones are often eroded by organisms which bore into the rock by various means. This process is known as [[bioerosion]].  It is most common in the tropics, and it is known throughout the [[fossil record]] (see Taylor and Wilson, 2003).\n\nBands of limestone emerge from the Earth's surface in often spectacular rocky outcrops and islands. Examples include the [[Rock of Gibraltar]], the [[The Burren|Burren]] in County Clare, Ireland; the [[Verdon Gorge]] in France; [[Malham Cove]] in [[North Yorkshire]] and the [[Isle of Wight]],<ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.iwight.com/council/documents/policies_and_plans/udp/2002_pdfs/minerals.pdf| title=Isle of Wight, Minerals| accessdate=8 October 2006| url-status=dead| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061102184845/http://www.iwight.com/council/documents/policies_and_plans/udp/2002_pdfs/minerals.pdf| archivedate=2 November 2006}}</ref> England; the [[Great Orme]] in Wales; on [[F\u00e5r\u00f6]] near the Swedish island of [[Gotland]], the [[Niagara Escarpment]] in Canada/United States, [[Notch Peak]] in Utah, the [[Ha Long Bay]] National Park in Vietnam and the hills around the [[Lijiang River]] and [[Guilin]] city in China.\n\nThe [[Florida Keys]], islands off the south coast of [[Florida]], are composed mainly of [[oolite|oolitic]] limestone (the Lower Keys) and the carbonate skeletons of [[coral]] reefs (the Upper Keys), which thrived in the area during interglacial periods when sea level was higher than at present.\n\nUnique habitats are found on [[alvar]]s, extremely level expanses of limestone with thin soil mantles.  The largest such expanse in Europe is the [[Stora Alvaret]] on the island of [[\u00d6land]], Sweden. Another area with large quantities of limestone is the island of Gotland, Sweden.

Limestone is readily available and relatively easy to cut into blocks or more elaborate carving.<ref name=cassar/> Ancient American sculptors valued limestone because it was easy to work and good for fine detail. Going back to the Late Preclassic period (by 200\u2013100 BCE), the [[Maya civilization]] (Ancient Mexico) created refined sculpture using limestone because of these excellent carving properties. The Maya would decorate the ceilings of their sacred buildings (known as [[Ancient Maya art|lintels]]) and cover the walls with carved limestone panels. Carved on these sculptures were political and social stories, and this helped communicate messages of the king to his people.<ref>{{cite book|first1=Linda |last1=Schele |first2=Mary Ellen |last2=Miller |title=The Blood of Kings: Dynasty and Ritual in Maya Art |publisher=Kimbell Art Museum |page=41}}</ref> Limestone is long-lasting and stands up well to exposure, which explains why many limestone ruins survive.

Train stations, banks and other structures from that era were normally made of limestone. It is used as a facade on some skyscrapers, but only in thin plates for covering, rather than solid blocks. In the United States, Indiana, most notably the Bloomington area, has long been a source of high quality quarried limestone, called [[Indiana limestone]]. Many famous buildings in London are built from [[Portland limestone]].\n\nLimestone was also a very popular building block in the Middle Ages in the areas where it occurred, since it is hard, durable, and commonly occurs in easily accessible surface exposures. Many medieval churches and castles in Europe are made of limestone.  [[Beer stone]] was a popular kind of limestone for medieval buildings in southern England.\n\nLimestone and (to a lesser extent) marble are reactive to acid solutions, making [[acid rain]] a significant problem to the preservation of artifacts made from this stone. Many limestone statues and building surfaces have suffered severe damage due to acid rain. Likewise limestone gravel has been used to protect lakes vulnerable to acid rain, acting as a [[pH buffer]]ing agent.  Acid-based cleaning chemicals can also etch limestone, which should only be cleaned with a neutral or mild [[alkali]]-based cleaner.\n\nOther uses include:\n* It is the raw material for the manufacture of [[quicklime]] (calcium oxide), [[slaked lime]] (calcium hydroxide), [[cement]] and [[mortar (masonry)|mortar]].\n* Pulverized limestone is used as a soil conditioner to neutralize acidic soils ([[agricultural lime]]).\n* Is crushed for use as [[construction aggregate|aggregate]]\u2014the solid base for many roads as well as in [[asphalt concrete]].\n* [[Geological formation]]s of limestone are among the best [[petroleum reservoir]]s;\n* As a [[reagent]] in [[flue-gas desulfurization]], it reacts with [[sulfur dioxide]] for air pollution control.\n* [[Glass making]], in some circumstances, uses limestone.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=zNicdkuulE4C&pg=PA1387&dq=Glass+making,+in+some+circumstances,+uses+limestone.#v=onepage&q=Glass%20making,%20in%20some%20circumstances,%20uses%20limestone.&f=false|title=Industrial Minerals & Rocks: Commodities, Markets, and Uses|last=Kogel|first=Jessica Elzea|date=2006|publisher=SME|isbn=9780873352338|language=en|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171216222141/https://books.google.com/books?id=zNicdkuulE4C&pg=PA1387&dq=Glass+making,+in+some+circumstances,+uses+limestone.&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwi65Iu0yI_YAhVT22MKHWTfAWgQ6AEIKTAA#v=onepage&q=Glass%20making,%20in%20some%20circumstances,%20uses%20limestone.&f=false|archivedate=16 December 2017}}</ref>\n* It is added to toothpaste, paper, plastics, paint, tiles, and other materials as both white pigment and a cheap filler.\n* It can suppress methane explosions in underground coal mines.\n* Purified, it is added to bread and cereals as a source of calcium.\n* Calcium levels in livestock feed are supplemented with it, such as for poultry (when ground up).<ref>{{cite web|url= http://poultryone.com/articles/calcium.html|title= A Guide to Giving Your Layer Hens Enough Calcium|work= Poultry One|url-status= live|archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20090403082817/http://poultryone.com/articles/calcium.html|archivedate= 3 April 2009}}</ref>\n* It can be used for remineralizing and increasing the alkalinity of purified water to prevent pipe corrosion and to restore essential nutrient levels.<ref>{{cite web|url= http://www.who.int/water_sanitation_health/dwq/nutconsensus/en/|title= Nutrient minerals in drinking-water and the potential health consequences of consumption of demineralized and remineralized and altered mineral content drinking-water: Consensus of the meeting|work= World Health Organization report|url-status= live|archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20071224165953/http://www.who.int/water_sanitation_health/dwq/nutconsensus/en/|archivedate= 24 December 2007}}</ref>\n* Used in [[blast furnace]]s, limestone binds with silica and other impurities to remove them from the iron.\n* It is used in sculptures because of its suitability for carving.\n\n=== Occupational safety and health ===\nPeople can be exposed to limestone in the workplace by inhalation of and eye contact with the dust.\n\n====United States====\nThe [[Occupational Safety and Health Administration]] (OSHA) has set the legal limit ([[permissible exposure limit]]) for limestone exposure in the workplace as 15&nbsp;mg/m<sup>3</sup> total exposure and 5&nbsp;mg/m<sup>3</sup> respiratory exposure over an 8-hour workday.
