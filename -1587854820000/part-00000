The current design of [[euro banknotes]], except for the \"new\" \u20ac5, \u20ac10, \u20ac20, \u20ac50, and upcoming \u20ac100 banknotes, has the word ''euro'' written in [[Latin alphabet|Latin]] and [[Greek alphabet|Greek]] alphabets. The [[Euro banknotes#Europa series|2013 design of the \u20ac 5 banknote]] introduced Cyrillic, adopting the spelling '''\u0415\u0412\u0420\u041e''', as described below.\nWhen Bulgaria issues Euro coins, if the Greek model is followed, the alternative spelling will go on the national ([[obverse]]) side.\n\nIn popular Bulgarian usage the currency is referred to as \u0435\u0432\u0440\u043e {{IPA-mk|\u02c8\u025bvro|}} and, less often, {{IPA-mk|\u025bv\u02c8ro|}} (from Bulgarian \u0415\u0432\u0440\u043e\u043f\u0430 {{IPA|[\u025bv\u02c8ropa]}}, meaning ''Europe''); the plural varies in spoken language \u2013 \u0435\u0432\u0440\u043e, \u0435\u0432\u0440\u0430 {{IPA|[\u025bv\u02c8ra]}}, \u0435\u0432\u0440\u043e\u0442\u0430 {{IPA|[\u02c8\u025bvrota]}} \u2013 but the most widespread form is \u0435\u0432\u0440\u043e \u2013 without inflection in plural.

The general plural form of euro is ''euri'', but the [[paucal]] or identically written (but not identically pronounced) genitive plural ''eura'' is used with all numbers, thus ''27 eura''. The numbers ending in 1 (e.g. 21 or 101) take the nominative singular, the exception being numbers ending in 11 (e.g. 11 or 111). The examples are: ''21 euro'', ''101 euro'', ''11 eura'', and ''111 eura'' respectively.\n\nThe general plural form of cent is ''centi'' and it is used with most numbers. The numbers ending in 1, except for those ending in 11, take the nominative singular ''cent'', while those ending in 2, 3 and 4 except 12, 13 or 14 take the paucal ''centa''. The examples are: ''1 cent'', ''4 centa'', ''7 centi'', ''10 centi'', ''11 centi'', ''12 centi'', ''22 centa'', ''27 centi'', ''31 cent'', ''101 cent'', ''102 centa'', ''111 centi''.\n\nBoth ''euro'' and ''cent'' in Croatian are of [[masculine gender]].\n\nPronunciation follows the rules of Croatian. ''Euro'' is pronounced {{IPA-sh|euro|}}, while ''cent'' is pronounced {{IPA|[\u02c8tsent]}}.\n\n===Czech===\nIn [[Czech language|Czech]], the words ''euro'' and ''cent'' are spelt the same as in English and pronounced per Czech phonology {{IPA-cs|\u02c8\u025buro|}}, {{IPA|[ts\u025bnt]}}. Occasionally the word ''eurocent'' is used instead of ''cent'' to distinguish the euro denomination versus its foreign counterparts. The spelling differs from the Czech word for Europe (''Evropa''); however \"euro-\" has become a standard prefix for all things relating to the EU (''Evropsk\u00e1 unie'').\n\nThe [[Czech declension]] uses different form of [[plural]] for various numerals: for 2, 3 and 4, it is plain [[nominative]] ''eura'' and ''centy'', while for numbers above 5, [[genitive]] (a vestige of [[partitive]]) ''eur'' and ''cent\u016f'' is used.\n\nFor compound numerals, there are two variants: either genitive plural is used (''21 eur'', ''22 eur'') or the form is determined by the unit part of the numeral (''21 euro'', ''22 eura''). The partitive genitive is used only when the whole numeral phrase is in nominative or accusative phrases, otherwise the expected case is used: ''sedm eur'' (7 euros-genitive), but ''se sedmi eury'' (with seven-instrumental euro-instrumental). Moreover, these otherwise common declensions are often ignored and non-declined ''euro'' is used for every value (''22 euro''), even though this form is [[linguistic prescription|proscribed]].\n\nIn Czech ''euro'' is of [[neuter gender]] and inflected as ''m\u011bsto'', while ''cent'' is masculine and inflected as ''hrad''.\n\n===Danish===\nThe word ''euro'' is included in the 2002 version of ''[[Retskrivningsordbogen]]'',<ref>{{cite web\n |title=''euro'' entry in Retskrivningsorbogen \n |publisher=[[Dansk Sprogn\u00e6vn]] \n |language=Danish \n |url=http://www.dsn.dk/cgi-bin/ordbog/ronet?S.x=0&S.y=0&M=1&P=cent \n |accessdate=17 October 2006 \n |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927235930/http://www.dsn.dk/cgi-bin/ordbog/ronet?S.x=0&S.y=0&M=1&P=cent \n |archivedate=27 September 2007 \n |url-status=dead \n}}</ref> the authoritative source for the [[Danish language]] (according to Danish law). Two plurals are given, ''euro'' when referring to an amount, and ''euroer'' when referring to coins. Both ''cent'' and ''eurocent'' are mentioned; the plural and singular forms are identical.\n\nDanish words of Greek origin containing the sequence ''eu'' are traditionally pronounced with [\u0153\u028a\u032f], e.g. ''Zeus, terapeut, eutanasi, Europa''. However, in the word ''Europa'', a newer pronunciation with [e\u028a\u032f] has gained ground in recent years, but this has not influenced the way ''euro'' is commonly pronounced.{{citation needed|date=January 2014}}\n\n===Dutch===\n'''Plural:''' In [[Dutch language|Dutch]], most abstract [[units of measurement]] are not pluralised, including the former [[Dutch guilder]] (''gulden'' in Dutch) and [[Belgian franc]] (called ''frank'' in Dutch), and now the euro. An amount such as \u20ac5 is pronounced ''5 euro''. This coincides with EU legislation stating that ''euro'' and ''cent'' should be used as both singular and plural. In Dutch, the words are however pluralised as ''euro's'' and ''centen'' when referring to individual coins.\n\nThe euro is divided into 100 ''cent'', as was the guilder. The Belgian franc was divided into 100 ''centiemen''.

Another popular slang term is the plural form ''euri'' ({{IPA|/\u02c8\u00f8\u02d0ri/}}) (or even the [[double plural]] ''euries'' ({{IPA|/\u02c8\u00f8\u02d0ris/}})), a deliberate [[Hypercorrection|hypercorrect]] form referring to the plural of Dutch words of Latin or Italian origin.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://onzetaal.nl/taaladvies/advies/euri |title=euri / euro's - Genootschap Onze Taal |publisher=Onzetaal.nl |date= |accessdate=23 September 2014}}</ref>\n\nIn Belgium, some [[Flemings]] refer to the 1-, 2- and 5-cent coins as ''koper'', which is the Dutch word for copper, the metal these coins are made of (compare [[Nickel (United States coin)|nickel]]). Another nickname is \"ros\" ([[red hair|\"redhead\"]]) or \"roskes\" (\"little redheads\"), referring to the colour of the coins.\n\n'''Syntax:''' In Dutch language print, the [[euro sign]] (\u20ac) is chiefly placed before the amount, from which it is often separated by a (thin) space.<ref name=dutch_valuta>[http://taaladvies.net/taal/advies/vraag/1178 Euro: valutateken voor of achter het bedrag?], Nederlandse Taalunie, retrieved 21 December 2006.</ref> This was also the case with the [[florin sign]] (\u0192).\n\n===English===\nOfficial practice for [[English language|English-language]] EU legislation (not necessarily in national legislation<ref name=\"eurorules\"/>) is to use the words ''euro'' and ''cent'' as both singular and plural.<ref name=\"Spellings_in_Official_Languages\"/> This practice originally arose out of legislation intended to ensure that the banknotes were uncluttered with a string of plurals.

For example, ''quid'' (same in singular and plural), which once referred to an Irish pound (and in the UK still refers to a [[British pound]]) is used as a synonym for ''euro''. Also, ''fiver'' and ''tenner'', which once referred to five and ten pounds respectively, now refer to five and ten euro{{spaced ndash}} either in the sense of the specific [[5 euro note|\u20ac5]] and [[10 euro note|\u20ac10]] banknotes, or in the broader sense of an equivalent sum of money.\n\n====In English-speaking countries outside Europe====\nThe term '''euro-cent''' is sometimes used{{Citation needed|date=April 2009}} in countries (such as Australia, Canada, and the United States) which also have \"cent\" as a currency subdivision, to distinguish them from their local coin. This usage, though unofficial, is mirrored on the coins themselves, which have the words ''EURO'' and ''CENT'' displayed on the common side.\n\n===Finnish===\nThe [[Finnish language|Finnish]] pronunciation for \"euro\" is {{IPA-fi|\u02c8euro|}}. In Finnish, the form ''sentti'' {{IPA-fi|\u02c8sent\u02d0i|}} is used for the cent \u2013 the letter 'c' is generally not used in Finnish, and nativized Finnish words cannot end in consonant combinations like '-nt', therefore an extra vowel 'i' is added. ''euro'' and ''sentti'' are declined like many other existing words ending in ''-o'' and ''-i'', and ''sentti'' displays [[consonant gradation]] (genitive ''euron'', ''sen'''t'''in''). With numerals, the [[partitive case|partitive]] singulars ''euroa'' and ''sentti\u00e4'' are used, e.g., ''10 euroa''. This is abbreviated ''10 \u20ac'', where the ''\u20ac'' symbol takes the role of the word ''euroa'' (never *''\u20ac10'' or *''10\u20ac''). The colon notation (''\u20ac:a'') must not be used with the partitive of ''euro'' when the number is in the nominative. In general, colon notation should be avoided and, for example, one should write ''euron'' or ''euroa'' instead of ''\u20ac:n'' or ''\u20ac:a''.\n\nPlurals (e.g., ''kymmenet eurot'' \"tens of euros\") exist, but they are not used with singular numbers (e.g., ''kymmenen euroa'' \"ten euro\").\n\n''Sentti'' is problematic in that its primary meaning in colloquial language is \"centimeter\". Thus, the officially recommended abbreviation of ''sentti'' is ''snt'', although Finnish merchants generally use a decimal notation (for example ''0,35 \u20ac'').\n\n'''Slang terms:''' In [[Helsinki slang]], a common nickname for euro is ''ege''. In [[Tampere]] slang ''Eero'', a common male name, may be used for euro.\n\n===French===\nIn French, the singular is ''un euro'' (masculine).

Initial letter C is often used in [[loanword]]s and corresponds to various pronunciations depending on the language of origin (e.g. [s] in ''Centime'', {{IPA|[t\u0283]}} in ''Cello'', {{IPA|[ts]}} in ''Celsius'' and [k] in ''Caf\u00e9''). Most of these words are therefore eventually spelt phonetically (e.g. ''Kaffee'', ''Tschechien'' ([[Czech Republic]]), ''Zentimeter'').\n\n[[Latin]] words beginning with \"ce\" such as ''centum'' (hundred) traditionally represent {{IPA|[ts]}} in German, and German words derived from these have therefore long been spelt with a ''Z'', which represents {{IPA|[ts]}} (as in ''Zentrum'' (centre), ''Zentimeter'' (centimetre), etc.). Equivalently, some German speakers pronounce the beginning of the word \"Cent\" {{IPA|[ts]}}, but since they are familiar with the English pronunciation of the American unit ''cent'', most people pronounce it [s].\n\nAs these are nouns, both Euro and Cent are capitalised in German.\n\n'''Slang terms:''' In Austria and Germany, the euro has also been called ''Teuro'', a play on the word ''teuer'', meaning 'expensive'. The [[Deutsche Mark]] was worth half as much as the euro (a ratio of approximately 2:1) and some grocers and restaurants were accused of taking advantage of the smaller numbers to increase their actual prices with the changeover.\n\nIn youth and Internet culture the fake plural ''Euronen'' is sometimes used; this form's origin is unknown but it bears resemblance to ''Dublonen'' ([[Dubloon]]s) and has a [[retro]] ring to it. Also, \"\u00d6re\" is occasionally used, the name of the [[\u00d6re|Swedish currency]]. Among some [[Punk subculture|punks]], the word \"Oi\", as in the punk rock subgenre of [[Oi!]], is used.{{Citation needed|date=August 2009}} Unlike the previous currencies (Mark and Schilling) which had well established nicknames for individual coins and notes, there are few widely used nicknames for Euros, but the two Euro coin is sometimes called ''Zwickel'' like the old two Mark piece and the 50 cent piece is sometimes ironically referred to as \"a rapper\" alluding to [[50 Cent]].{{citation needed|date=January 2017}}\n\nIn German [[Usenet]] culture, the name ''Fragezeichen'' (question mark) was occasionally used in reference to initial problems with display of the [[euro sign]], which was often rendered as a question mark. The term was most often written using the mock currency code FRZ.<ref>{{cite web|title=FRZ als Synonym fuer EUR|url=http://de.etc.sprache.deutsch.narkive.com/TTXv2F4G/frz-als-synonym-fuer-eur|publisher=NARCHIVE: Newsgroup Archive|date=17 February 2005|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141012134239/http://de.etc.sprache.deutsch.narkive.com/TTXv2F4G/frz-als-synonym-fuer-eur|archivedate=12 October 2014|language=German|url-status=live}}</ref> This technical trouble has diminished  and so has the usage of this term.\n\n'''Abbreviations:''' EUR. TEUR for thousand Euros and MEUR for a million Euros are often used in financial documents. Numbers are given with a comma as decimal separator.\n\n===Greek===\nIn the [[Greek language]] the indeclinable word {{lang|el|\u03b5\u03c5\u03c1\u03ce}} ({{IPA-el|ev\u02c8ro|}}) is used as the currency's name. It was decided to use [[omega]] (\u03c9) rather than [[omicron]] (\u03bf) as the last letter of the word, partly because a noun ending with omicron would encourage mutability, and partly to stress the origin of the euro in the Greek word {{lang|el|\u0395\u03c5\u03c1\u03ce\u03c0\u03b7}} (''Eur\u014dp\u0113'', Europe) which is also spelt with omega and it is actually written on the euro notes in Greek as {{lang|el|\u0395\u03a5\u03a1\u03a9}}. Also, the spelling {{lang|el|\u0395\u03a5\u03a1\u039f}} (resulting in a plural {{lang|el|\u0395\u03a5\u03a1\u0391}}) on the notes could have confused other Europeans, who might read it as a string of [[Latin alphabet|Latin]] letters: ''eypo''. A plural form ''evra'', as if from a regular declinable neuter noun in ''-o'', is sometimes used in a jocular way.\n\nFor the cent, the terms used in Greece are {{lang|el|\u03bb\u03b5\u03c0\u03c4\u03cc}}, plural {{lang|el|\u03bb\u03b5\u03c0\u03c4\u03ac}} (''[[Greek lepton|lept\u00f3]]'', plural ''lept\u00e1''), a name used for small denominations of various ancient and modern Greek currencies, including the [[greek drachma|drachma]] (which the euro replaced). The word means '[[minute]]' (literally \"thin\"), the same as the unit of measurement of time or of angle. The term {{lang|el|\u03b5\u03c5\u03c1\u03c9\u03bb\u03b5\u03c0\u03c4\u03cc}}, plural {{lang|el|\u03b5\u03c5\u03c1\u03c9\u03bb\u03b5\u03c0\u03c4\u03ac}} (''evrolept\u00f3'', plural ''evrolept\u00e1'') is sometimes used when a speaker wants to be completely specific that they are referring to money and not time.\n\nSome colloquial names for currency are also in use for the euro. One and two euro coins are respectively called {{lang|el|\u03c6\u03c1\u03ac\u03b3\u03ba\u03bf}} (''frago'') and {{lang|el|\u03b4\u03af\u03c6\u03c1\u03b1\u03b3\u03ba\u03bf}} (''difrago'') from the French ''franc''. A 5 euro banknote is also colloquially called {{lang|el|\u03c4\u03ac\u03bb\u03b7\u03c1\u03bf}} (''taliro'') from the Germanic root ''thaler'' via the Italian ''talero''. A 10 euro banknote is called {{lang|el|\u03b4\u03b5\u03ba\u03ac\u03c1\u03b9\u03ba\u03bf}} (''dekariko''), a 20 euro banknote is called {{lang|el|\u03b5\u03b9\u03ba\u03bf\u03c3\u03ac\u03c1\u03b9\u03ba\u03bf}} (''eikosariko'') or {{lang|el|\u03b5\u03b9\u03ba\u03bf\u03c3\u03ac\u03c1\u03b9}} (''eikosari''), and a 50 euro banknote is called {{lang|el|\u03c0\u03b5\u03bd\u03b7\u03bd\u03c4\u03ac\u03c1\u03b9\u03ba\u03bf}} (''penintariko''), derivatives of the words for ten, twenty and fifty.\n\n10 lepta of a drachma were called {{lang|el|\u03b4\u03b5\u03ba\u03ac\u03c1\u03b1}} (''dekara''), but since lepta of the drachma were out of circulation long before the euro, this word is now considered too old-fashioned and only used in old expressions and thus it is not used for the 10 eurocent coin. Nevertheless, all Greeks understand the word to stand for 10 cents of any currency and thus use it for non-euro currencies like the dime of the US dollar. The same is true for the 5-cent coin which is not called {{lang|el|\u03c0\u03b5\u03bd\u03c4\u03ac\u03c1\u03b1}} (''pentara'') like its drachma equivalent. These words come from the words for five and ten respectively.\n\nIn Cyprus, however, the cent is officially called {{lang|el|\u03c3\u03b5\u03bd\u03c4}} (''cent'') both in singular and plural. This is the name formerly used for {{frac|100}} of the [[Cypriot pound]] chosen for its neutrality to both official languages of the Republic ([[Greek language|Greek]] and [[Turkish language|Turkish]]).{{Citation needed|date=October 2009}}\n\n===Hungarian===\nIn [[Hungarian language|Hungarian]] the currency is named ''eur\u00f3'' ({{IPA-hu|\u02c8\u025buro\u02d0|}}) and ''cent'' ({{IPA-hu|\u02c8t\u0361s\u025bnt|}}) without plural forms (as in Hungarian no plural is used after numerals), the former written with an accented ''\u00f3'', as decided by the [[Magyar Tudom\u00e1nyos Akad\u00e9mia Nyelvtudom\u00e1nyi Int\u00e9zete|Research Institute for Linguistics of the Hungarian Academy of Sciences]].{{cn|date=February 2020}} The spelling is also in accordance with the word ''Eur\u00f3pa'' (\"Europe\") in Hungarian.\n\nHungarian language does not use plural after numerals, as numerals already express plural; however, both ''eur\u00f3'' and ''cent'' can take suffixes regarding to [[grammatical case]]s, just as:\n* Accusative case: ''eur\u00f3t''\n* Dative case: ''eur\u00f3nak''\n* Instrumental case: ''eur\u00f3val'' (\"with euro\")\n* Causative case: ''eur\u00f3\u00e9rt'' (\"for euro\")\n* etc.\n\nOn introduction of the euro, Hungary\u2014along with Lithuania, Latvia, and Slovenia\u2014struggled for the euro to be written in its official documents according to its own usage and spelling, in contrast with Community law, which provides for a single name throughout the Union (in the nominative singular and taking account of different alphabets).<ref>{{cite web|title= Opinion of the European Central Bank of 16 December 2005 at the request of the Slovenian Ministry of Economic Affairs on the provisions of the draft Companies Act concerning redenomination resulting from the introduction of the euro (CON/2005/57)|url = http://www.ecb.int/ecb/legal/pdf/en_con_2005_57_f_sign.pdf |accessdate = 5 April 2009| author=European Central Bank | authorlink = European Central Bank | date = 16 December 2005| publisher=European Communities|quote= [. . .] Article 2 of Council Regulation (EC) No 974/98 of 3 May 1998 on the introduction of the euro2 stipulates that \u2018\u2026 the currency of the participating Member States shall be the euro\u20193.

The [[Accademia della Crusca]] assigned to Severina Parodi, lexicographer, and to [[Luca Serianni]], language historian, the task to give a response. They deliberated in favour of ''euri'' in 1999 with the motivation that \"euro is a masculine noun\". But the issue was then re-examined many times.\nFinally, in 2001 the consensus of the Accademia coalesced in favour of invariability.<ref>[http://forum.accademiadellacrusca.it/forum_8/interventi/3231.shtml Gli euro e le lingue] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080118090255/http://forum.accademiadellacrusca.it/forum_8/interventi/3231.shtml |date=18 January 2008 }}, issue 23 (October 2001) of ''La Crusca per voi'' {{in lang|it}}</ref> The rationale was based on the fact that abbreviated words originating from a longer word (for example ''auto'' from ''automobile'' (car) or ''moto'' from ''motocicletta'' (motorbike)) do not have a plural form, as well as the fact that the word ''euro'' is considered an abbreviation of the word ''Eurovaluta'' (European currency) .

''Euro'', ''c\u00eantimo'' and ''centavo'' are masculine nouns in Portuguese, and as such, \"the cents\" are translated as ''os c\u00eantimos'' and \"those euros\" as ''aqueles euros''.\n\nIn Brazil the pronunciation is {{IPA-pt|\u02c8ew\u027eu|}} (generally {{IPA|[\u02c8eu\u032f\u027eu]}} in Rio de Janeiro and further north, as in Portugal, and {{IPA|[\u02c8e\u028a\u032f\u027e\u028a]}} in S\u00e3o Paulo and further south and west as well as the places [[Portuguese language#Brazil|where southern Brazilians settled]]) and fractional values are called ''centavos de euro''<ref>[http://g1.globo.com/mundo/noticia/2010/07/euros-cunhados-pelo-vaticano-entram-em-circulacao.html \"Euros cunhados pelo Vaticano entram em circula\u00e7\u00e3o na Europa\"]. ''[[O Globo]]''. Retrieved 12 October 2010</ref> (cents of euro) to differentiate them from [[Brazilian real]] \"centavos\".\n\n===Romanian===\nIn [[Romanian language|Romanian]] the euro and cent are called ''euro'' and ''cent'' {{IPA-ro|t\u0361\u0283ent|}} (plural ''{{lang|ro|cen\u021bi}}'' {{IPA-ro|t\u0361\u0283ent\u0361s\u02b2|}}). The official plural of ''euro'' is also ''euro'', and this official form was readily adopted by speakers. The \"eu\" construct is not a diphthong, thus the pronunciation is {{IPA-ro|\u02c8e.uro|}}.\n\nWhen speaking in a familiar\u2013vernacular setting, some speakers would make the informal plural \"euroi\" (not seen as academic, and not used officially; its stylistic value\u2013connotation is less than \"bucks\" for US dollars or \"quid\" for GBP in English and ''much lower'' than the almost everyday use of \"piasse\" (piastre, with the cent called \"sou\") for CAD in Canadian French). The USD also has a nickname (the word \"para\"/\"parai\" of Turkish origin) with the same negative stylistic value. Not to be confused with general nicknames for money in general or unclear nicknames for foreign currencies (e.g.\"coco\" \u2013 the specific currency is supposed to be inferred by the listener from previous info/conversation or from the country the speakers are in).\n\n===Scottish Gaelic===\nDue to the lack of a governing body, there is no consistent usage regarding the terms for euro and cent in [[Scottish Gaelic]]. The various approaches include:\n\n* use of English spellings (including the English plural form and pronunciation), treating the nouns as [[Uninflected word|indeclinable]]: ''an euro'' (genitive ''an euro''; plural ''na euro(s)''), ''an cent'' (genitive ''an cent'', plural ''na cent(s)'')\n* use of English spellings and pronunciation for euro but with Gaelic case marking (both masculine and feminine as the gender of the word has not been determined to date)\n** as a masculine noun: ''an t-euro'' (genitive ''an euro'', plural ''na h-euro(s)'')\n** as a feminine noun: ''an euro'' (genitive ''na h-euro'', plural ''na h-euro(s)'')\n* fully gaelicized forms (based on the Gaelic word ''E\u00f2rpa'' \"Europe\") such as: ''an t-e\u00f2ra'' (genitive ''an e\u00f2ra'', plural ''na h-e\u00f2rathan''), ''an seant'' (genitive ''an t-seant'', plural ''na seantaichean'')<ref>Klevenhaus, M. ''Lehrbuch der schottisch-g\u00e4lischen Sprache'' (2009) Buske Verlag {{ISBN|978-3-87548-520-2}}</ref>\n\n===Slovak===\nIn [[Slovak language|Slovak]] the euro and cent are called ''euro'' and ''cent'', the plural forms for amounts between 2 and 4 are ''2 eur\u00e1/centy'', and the plural forms for larger amounts are ''5 eur/centov''. ''Euro'' is spelt with a ''u'' because it is derived from the word ''Eur\u00f3pa'' (Europe). The c in cent represents {{IPA|/ts/}}.\n\n'''Slang terms:''' common nicknames for euro in Slovak includes: ''eur\u00e1\u010de'', ''evri'', ''jur\u00e1\u0161e'', ''\u00e9\u010dka'' (literally \"e\"-s or \"letters \u2018e\u2019\"). Cents are sometimes jokingly called ''\u0161est\u00e1ky'' (as a common term for coins with small value); ''me\u010f\u00e1ky'' or ''meden\u00e1ky'' (literally \"coppers\" or \"the copper ones\") or ''haliere'' which is a reference to the small coins of the original Slovak currency.\n\n===Slovene===\nIn [[Slovene language|Slovene]] the euro and cent are called ''evro'' and ''cent'' ({{IPA-sl|\u02c8e\u02d0wr\u0254|}}, {{IPA-sl|ts\u025bnt|}}), the dual form is ''2 evra/centa'' ({{IPA-sl|\u02c8e\u02d0wra|}}, {{IPA-sl|\u02c8tse\u02d0nta|}} or {{IPA-sl|\u02c8ts\u025b\u02d0n-|}}) and the plural forms are ''3/4 evri/centi'' ({{IPA-sl|\u02c8e\u02d0wri|}}, {{IPA-sl|\u02c8tse\u02d0nti|}} or {{IPA-sl|\u02c8ts\u025b\u02d0n-|}}), ''5+ evrov/centov'' ({{IPA-sl|\u02c8e\u02d0wr\u0254w|}}, {{IPA-sl|\u02c8tse\u02d0nt\u0254w|}} or {{IPA-sl|\u02c8ts\u025b\u02d0n-|}}), the same declension case being used for all higher numerals up to 100, then beginning again (''101 evro/cent'', ''102 evra/centa'', ''103 evri/centi'', ''104 evri/centi'', ''105 evrov/centov'' etc.). ''Evro'' is spelt with ''v'' according to standard [[Slovene orthography]], and matches the word ''Evropa'' (Europe).\n\nIn laws and regulations, though, the word \u2018evro\u2019 is replaced with the word \u2018euro\u2019 in all grammatical cases in accordance with an agreement between Slovenia and the [[European Union]]. In normative [[Slovene language]] usage \u2018evro\u2019 spelling should only be used, except as noted.<ref>http://www.ecb.int/ecb/legal/pdf/en_con_2006_29_f_sign.pdf</ref>\n\n===Spanish===\nIn the Spanish language, the official plural is the same as its regular plural ''euros''. For the cent, the word ''[[c\u00e9ntimo]]'' (plural ''c\u00e9ntimos'') can be used. The fraction of the [[Spanish peseta|peseta]] was also called ''c\u00e9ntimo'', but no c\u00e9ntimo coins had been issued since 1980, and had since been demonetised. The word \"euro\" is pronounced {{IPA-es|\u02c8ew\u027eo|}} in Spanish, and \"c\u00e9ntimo\" {{IPA-es|\u02c8\u03b8entimo|}} or {{IPA-es|\u02c8sentimo|}}.\n\n'''Slang terms''': the euro is often referred to as ''pavo'', meaning ''turkey'' in English (the usual translation for ''buck'' in dubbed films).\n\n===Swedish===\nIn [[Swedish language|Swedish]] writing, euro is spelt ''euro'' (and cent is spelt ''cent'') both in singular and plural, or written EUR, or \u20ac. The \u20ac sign is common in Finland but rare in Sweden. The currency \"the euro\" is spelt ''euron'' following Swedish grammar rules. There are many Swedish laws mentioning amounts in euro, because of EU directives, using ''euro'' for the amounts and expression like \"belopp i euro\" (amount in euro), not the \u20ac sign.<ref>https://lagen.nu/search/?q=euro</ref>\n\nIn Sweden, the accepted pronunciations are {{IPA-sv|\u02c8\u025b\u030cv(\u02d0)r\u028a|}} (more common and similar to how ''eu'' is pronounced in modern Swedish in ''neuro-'') or {{IPA-sv|\u02c8\u025b\u030c\u0275r\u028a|}} (similar to how ''eu'' is pronounced in modern Swedish in ''Europa'').<ref name=\"Sprakradet\">[http://www.spraknamnden.se/fragor/arkiv_sprakrad_02.htm#euro Swedish Language Council: \"Veckans spr\u00e5kr\u00e5d: Euro\"] Linked 2012-04-29</ref> However, many Swedes choose to pronounce it in a more English way {{IPA-sv|\u02c8j\u01d4\u02d0r\u028a|}} (no ''s'' in plural). This pronunciation is rejected by official authorities, such as the [[Swedish Language Council]],<ref name=\"Sprakradet\"/> and not used in television news. In Sweden there are no widespread slang terms since the euro is a foreign currency.\n\nIn Finland, the euro is the official currency, and Swedish is an official language alongside [[Finnish language|Finnish]]. The same spelling as in Sweden is used (officially [[Finland-Swedish|Swedish in Finland]] is spelt as in Sweden). The pronunciation, however, is {{IPA-sv|\u02c8\u011buro|}}, which has some similarities to [[Finnish language|Finnish]] pronunciation. The abbreviation is like 3,14 \u20ac, same as for Finnish. Among Swedish-speaking as well as Finnish-speaking people in [[Helsinki]], a common slang term is \"ege\".\n\n===Welsh===\nIn [[Welsh language|Welsh]], euro and cent are called ''ewro'' {{IPA-cy|\u02c8\u025bur\u0254|}} (masculine) and ''sent'' {{IPA-cy|s\u025bnt|}} (feminine). The plural forms are respectively ''ewros'' {{IPA-cy|\u02c8\u025bur\u0254s, \u02c8\u025bur\u0254z|}} and ''sentiau'' {{IPA-cy|\u02c8s\u025bntja\u0268, \u02c8s\u025bntjai|}}, although in the Welsh language, numerals are always followed by the singular form of nouns, thus: ''pum ewro'' (\u20ac5), ''deg sent'' (\u20ac0.10). Informally, the more Anglicised {{IPA-cy|\u02c8\u026auro|}} may be used, written either the Welsh way, ''iwro'',<ref>{{cite web|url=https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/wales.cymraeg/MxybMcdO8OY|title=Google Groups|website=groups.google.com}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.scarletfever.org/forum/gwaharddiad-byrnenewyddion-eto_topic22994.html|title=Gwaharddiad Byrne..Newyddion eto ?|publisher=}}</ref> or as in English, ''euro.''<ref>{{cite web|url=http://ygbmalmaen.blogspot.com/2012/06/this-is-jodi-my-blog-is-not-working.html|title=Ysgol Gyfun Bro Morgannwg yn yr Almaen|last=HarrietElias|publisher=}}</ref> The second of these, the native word ''euro'' {{IPA-cy|\u02c8\u025b\u0268r\u0254, \u02c8\u025bir\u0254|}} (\"to gild\") already exists. In Welsh the abbreviation ''c'' stands for ''ceiniog'' (penny).\n\n==Other languages==\n===Albanian===\nIn [[Albanian language|Albanian]], the euro is referred to as \"euro\". This is the same for Albanian in Kosovo, Macedonia and rest of the Balkans. Some Kosovo Albanian speakers however, pronounce euro like Germans; 'oiro'/'oi', due to heavily migration. It is derived from the Albanian word for Europe, \"Europa\", \"Europ\u00eb\" and also \"Evropa\"/\"Evrop\u00eb\". All variants are official in Albanian, however Albania uses Euro, Europa or Europe whilst other Albanian dialects such as in Kosovo, Macedonia, Montenegro and Serbia often use Evrope or Evropa. However the currency euro is not ever pronounced as evro like their Slavic neighbours.\n\nNote: depending on dialect, location, diaspora and ethnicity some [[Albanians]] vary their pronunciations based on standard Albanian, Italian, Greek, German or Slavic (such as those in Macedonia or Serbia).\n\n===Arabic===\nIn Arabic, the euro is usually referred to as {{lang|ar|\u064a\u0648\u0631\u0648}} {{IPA-ar|\u02c8ju\u02d0ro, \u02c8ju\u02d0ru|}}, which is an adaptation of the English pronunciation of the currency's name. Another naming is {{lang|ar|\u0627\u0648\u0631\u0648}} {{IPA-ar|\u02c8\u0294o\u02d0ro|}}, which is an approximation of the French pronunciation {{IPA-fr|\u00f8\u02c8\u0281o|}}. In most cases this term is used both for the singular and the plural form, although the plurals {{lang|ar|\u064a\u0648\u0631\u0648\u0627\u062a}} {{IPA|/ju\u02d0ro\u02c8wa\u02d0t/}} and {{lang|ar|\u064a\u0648\u0631\u0648\u0647\u0627\u062a}} {{IPA|/ju\u02d0ro\u02c8ha\u02d0t/}} are sometimes encountered. The name for Europe in Arabic is {{lang|ar|\u0623\u0648\u0631\u0648\u0628\u0627}} {{IPA|/\u0294o(\u02d0)\u02c8robba, -\u02c8roppa/}}. Because [[loanword]]s are not of [[Classical Arabic|Arabic]] origin, they are pronounced in accordance with the spoken [[varieties of Arabic]] phonology. For example, {{lang|ar|\u0623\u0648\u0631\u0648\u0628\u0627}} is pronounced {{IPA-arz|\u0294o\u02c8\u027eobb\u0251, -\u02c8\u027eopp\u0251|}} by [[Egyptian Arabic]] speakers, while {{IPA|[\u0294o\u02d0\u02c8robba, -\u02c8roppa]}} by [[Levantine Arabic]] speakers.\n\nAttempts to artificially arabize the pronunciation according to the [[Arabic phonology|standardized Arabic phonology]] would be more conforming to [[Arabic transliteration]]s such as ''{{transl|ar|DIN|Y\u016br\u016b / \u02be\u016ar\u016b, \u02be\u016arubb\u0101}}'' which would be theoretically pronounced {{IPA|/\u02c8ju\u02d0ru\u02d0, \u02c8\u0294u\u02d0ru\u02d0, \u0294u\u02d0\u02c8rubba\u02d0/}} for {{lang|ar|\u064a\u0648\u0631\u0648,&lrm; \u0627\u0648\u0631\u0648,&lrm; \u0623\u0648\u0631\u0648\u0628\u0627}}, respectively.\nSee also [[List of diglossic regions#Arabic|Arabic diglossia]] to understand why the pronunciation differs from region to region.\n\n===Armenian===\nThe [[Armenian language|Armenian]] word for euro is {{lang|hy|\u0535\u057e\u0580\u0578}}, pronounced {{IPA-hy|j\u025bv\u02c8\u0279\u0254|}} in exactly the same way as the Greek, with an added initial ''y'' sound. It is derived from the Armenian word for Europe, {{lang|hy|\u0535\u057e\u0580\u0578\u057a\u0561}}, which is pronounced {{IPA-hy|j\u025bv\u0279\u0254\u02c8pa|}}, as stress in Armenian usually falls on the final syllable. Cent in Armenian is pronounced {{IPA-hy|\u02c8t\u0361s\u02b0\u025bnt|}} ({{lang|hy|\u0581\u0565\u0576\u057f}}).\n\nThe plural of euro, in accordance with the formation of plurals in Armenian, is {{lang|hy|\u0535\u057e\u0580\u0578\u0576\u0565\u0580}} {{IPA-hy|\u025bv\u0279\u0254\u02c8n\u025b\u0279|}}. The plural of cent, however, is {{lang|hy|\u0581\u0565\u0576\u057f\u056b}}, pronounced {{IPA-hy|t\u0361s\u02b0\u025bn\u02c8ti|}}.\n\n===Azerbaijani===\nThe [[Azerbaijani language|Azerbaijani]] name for Europe is ''Avropa'', similar to that of its sister language, Turkish, and the Azerbaijani word for euro, derived from that for Europe, is ''avro'', identical to Turkish.\n\n===Chinese===\nIn [[Chinese language|Chinese]], the euro is known as \u6b27\u5143 ([[Simplified Chinese characters|simplified]]), \u6b50\u5143 ([[Traditional Chinese characters|traditional]]), ''\u014duyu\u00e1n'' ([[pinyin]]), from the Chinese word for Europe, \u6b27\u6d32 / \u6b50\u6d32, ''\u014cuzh\u014du'', and the word \u5143 ''yu\u00e1n'', meaning coin. This follows the same pattern as the word for the American dollar \u7f8e\u5143, ''m\u011biyu\u00e1n''. For cents, the word \u6b27\u5206 / \u6b50\u5206 ''\u014duf\u0113n'', is used. However, in [[Hong Kong]] it is often referred to as \u6b50\u7f85 ({{zh|j=au\u00b9lo\u2074}}) to distinguish it from the [[Australian dollar]] (\u6fb3\u5143, {{zh|j=ou\u00b3jyun\u2074}}), because in Cantonese \u6b50\u5143 and \u6fb3\u5143 have similar pronunciations.\n\nAs the character \u5143 in \u6b27\u5143, is a [[Classifier (linguistics)|counter word]] in Chinese, there is no need to put a measure word before the word. An example is: \u4e94\u5341\u6b27\u5143 ([[Chinese numerals|financial Chinese]]: \u4f0d\u62fe\u6b27\u5143) ''w\u01d4sh\u00ed \u014duyu\u00e1n'' for fifty euros.\n\n===Esperanto===\nIn [[Esperanto]], the currency is called '''\"e\u016dro\"''',<ref>[[:eo:E\u016dro]]</ref> similar to the Esperanto word for the continent \"E\u016dropo.\" The ''o'' ending in euro conveniently accords with the standard ''-o'' noun ending in Esperanto, but rather than sound out ''e'' and ''u'' separately, Esperanto speakers use the [[diphthong]] ''e\u016d'', which matches its etymology. Plurals are formed in accordance with Esperanto rules, '''''e\u016droj''''' and '''''cendoj'''''. The words are also declined as any Esperanto noun (e\u016dro/e\u016droj in the [[nominative]], e\u016dron/e\u016drojn in the [[accusative]]). Since the inventor of the name \"euro\" [[Germain Pirlot]] is an Esperantist it is often assumed that he intentionally chose a word that fits well into the Esperanto grammar.\n\nA cent is '''''cendo''''', as is commonly used for subunits of all centimalized currency (cents, centimes, etc.). The alternatives are ''centimo'' from the French ''centime'' or a more technical ''centono'', literally, \"one-hundredth part\". (Esperanto speakers are unlikely to call a cent ''cento,'' since ''cento'' means a group of 100, rather than a hundredth.)\n\n===Faroese===\nIn [[Faroese language|Faroese]] the euro is called '''evra''', a feminine noun derived from the Faroese name of Europe, ''Evropa''; this makes Faroese (with Icelandic<!--Just wrong(?), see Maltese-section: \"and Maltese\"-->) one of only two European languages in which the word for the euro is feminine. The plural is formed regularly: '''evrur'''. The cents are often called '''sent''' which is a neuter word and has the same form in the [[nominative case|nominative]] plural.\n\n===Georgian===\nIn [[Georgian language|Georgian]], the euro is called {{lang|ka|\u10d4\u10d5\u10e0\u10dd}} (''evro'', pronounced {{IPA-ka|\u02c8\u025bvr\u0254|}}), derived from the Georgian word for Europe, {{lang|ka|\u10d4\u10d5\u10e0\u10dd\u10de\u10d0}} {{IPA-ka|\u02c8\u025bvr\u0254p\u02bc\u0251|}}. Unlike in Greek and Armenian, the stress of the word ''evro'' falls on the first syllable, as is usual in Georgian. Cent is {{lang|ka|\u10ea\u10d4\u10dc\u10e2\u10d8}} {{IPA-ka|\u02c8ts\u02b0\u025bnt\u02bci|}}, as nativized Georgian words cannot end in a consonant, so an extra vowel 'i' is added. The respective plurals of euro and cent are {{lang|ka|\u10d4\u10d5\u10e0\u10dd\u10d4\u10d1\u10d8}} {{IPA-ka|\u02c8\u025bvr\u0254\u025bbi|}} and {{lang|ka|\u10ea\u10d4\u10dc\u10e2\u10d4\u10d1\u10d8}} {{IPA-ka|\u02c8ts\u02b0\u025bnt\u02bc\u025bbi|}}.\n\n===Hebrew===\nWhen euro coins and banknotes were introduced, the question of the spelling and pronunciation of the currency's name in Hebrew arose. The official name of the currency established by the [[Academy of the Hebrew Language]] and the [[Bank of Israel]] is {{nowrap|{{Hebrew|\u05d0\u05b5\u05d9\u05e8\u05d5\u05b9}} {{IPA-he|\u02c8e\u0281o|}},<ref>{{cite web|url=http://hebrew-academy.org.il/2010/03/24/%D7%90%D7%99%D7%A8%D7%95-%D7%90%D7%95-%D7%99%D7%95%D7%A8%D7%95/|title=\u05d0\u05d9\u05e8\u05d5 \u05d0\u05d5 \u05d9\u05d5\u05e8\u05d5? - \u05d4\u05d0\u05e7\u05d3\u05de\u05d9\u05d4 \u05dc\u05dc\u05e9\u05d5\u05df \u05d4\u05e2\u05d1\u05e8\u05d9\u05ea|website=hebrew-academy.org.il}}</ref>}} derived from {{nowrap|{{Hebrew|\u05d0\u05b5\u05d9\u05e8\u05d5\u05b9\u05e4\u05b8\u05bc\u05d4}} {{IPA-he|e\u02c8\u0281opa|}} (Europe).}}\n\nAn unofficial spelling and pronunciation {{Nowrap|{{Hebrew|\u05d9\u05d5\u05bc\u05e8\u05d5\u05b9}} {{IPA-he|\u02c8ju\u0281o|}}}}, derived from the English pronunciation of the currency's name, is also used.\n\nAlthough in Hebrew currency names are usually declined for singular and plural, both forms of the Euro name are used for the singular and plural alike.\n\n===Hindi===\nIn [[Hindi]], the euro is spelt as \u092f\u0942\u0930\u094b (Y\u016bro), while cent is written as \u0938\u0947\u0902\u091f (se\u1e47\u1e6d). Both the words are not pluralised. Europe is known as \u092f\u0942\u0930\u094b\u092a (Y\u016brop) in Hindi.\n\n===Icelandic===\nIn [[Icelandic language|Icelandic]] the euro is called ''[[wikt:en:evra#Icelandic|evra]]'', a feminine noun derived from the Icelandic name of Europe, ''[[wikt:Evr\u00f3pa#Icelandic|Evr\u00f3pa]]''; this makes Icelandic (with Faroese<!--Just wrong(?), see Maltese: \"and Maltese\"-->) one of only two European languages in which the word for the euro is feminine. The plural is formed regularly: ''[[wikt:en:evrur#Icelandic|evrur]]''. The cents are often called '''sent''' which is a neuter word and has the same form in the [[nominative case|nominative]] plural. However, a more [[usus|common usage]] is to write, say, 20 cents as ''0,20 evrur''.\n\n===Ido===\nIn [[Ido (language)|Ido]], there is a rule that \"every word pertaining to a national or local custom will get imported to the language without change or adaption, both the singular and the plural forms alike\" (known as ''vorti stranjera'' \u2013 foreign words). This gets especially applied to \"currencies, weights and measurements that don't belong to the [[metric system]]\" (according to KGD, Kompleta Gramatiko Detaloza \u2013 Ido's grammar book). Thus the best word for \"euro\" would be just ''euro'', like ''dollar'' and ''pound'', with the plural probably kept the same: ''euro'', since most languages do that.\n\nIn common speech, though, many Idists commonly refer to the currency as ''euro'' and ''euri'' as if it got fully adopted to the language because of the common use of the currency.\n\nSimilarly, \"cent\" is ''cent'', with the plural imported from its source, English: ''cents''.\n\nFor both words, there are two other possibilities for pluralization. The native plural ''-i'' could be added to the ''vorto stranjera'' with the dash to mark that it's a foreign word: ''cent-i'' and ''euro-i'', or to add the plural definite article ''le'': ''le cent'' and ''le euro'', though that generally means \"the cents\" and \"the euros\".\n\n===Japanese===\nIn Japanese the euro is called \"y\u016bro\" (\u30e6\u30fc\u30ed) based on the English pronunciation, using the [[katakana]] syllabary employed for foreign words. However, the word for Europe in Japanese is \"y\u014droppa\" (\u30e8\u30fc\u30ed\u30c3\u30d1), probably borrowed from the [[Japanese words of Portuguese origin|Portuguese]] ''Europa'' ({{IPA|\u02c8ew.\u027e\u0254p\u0250}}) or from the [[Japanese words of Dutch origin|Dutch]] \"Europa\", not English. The cent uses the same word employed for all currencies using cents. This is rendered \"sento\" (or \u30bb\u30f3\u30c8 in the katakana script) and it is also based on the English pronunciation. In Japanese, like other East Asian languages, no plurals are used for units so both \"y\u016bro\" and \"sento\" are used as the singular and plural.\n\n===Korean===\nIn [[Korean language|Korean]] [[North\u2013South differences in the Korean language|of South Korea]], the Euro is called \"[[Revised Romanization of Korean|yuro]]\" (\uc720\ub85c) and Cent is called \"[[Revised Romanization of Korean|senteu]]\" (\uc13c\ud2b8). The word for Europe in Korean is \"[[Revised Romanization of Korean|Yureop]]\" (\uc720\ub7fd). They are all based on the English pronunciation.\n\n===Latin===\n[[Contemporary Latin|Living Latin]] enthusiasts use ''euro'', -''onis'' (pl. ''eurones''); sometimes also ''euronummus'', ''-i'' (pl. ''euronummi''), ''eurum'', ''-i'' (pl. ''eura'')<ref>[http://www.fondazionecanussio.org/ColloquiaJuliana.pdf ''Colloquia Iuliana''] \u2013 Opus Fundatum Niccol\u00f2 Canussio</ref> or even ''euronus'', ''-i'' (pl. ''euroni'').<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.vaticanradio.org/tedesco/tedarchi/2007/NuntiiLatini/nuntii_latini2007.htm|title=Statio Radiphonica Vaticana \u2013 Nuntii latini|accessdate=25 February 2012|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120713160519/http://www.vaticanradio.org/tedesco/tedarchi/2007/NuntiiLatini/nuntii_latini2007.htm|archivedate=13 July 2012|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\n=== Manx ===\nThe [[Manx language|Manx]] word for \"euro\" is either ''oarey'' (plural: ''oaraghyn''), based on ''Yn Oarpey'' (\"Europe\"), or ''euro'', from English. ''Cent'' is either ''kent'' (plural: ''kentyn'') or ''sent''.\n\n===Norwegian===\nIn [[Norwegian language|Norwegian]] there could be a problem concerning the spelling, since euro is [[Grammatical gender|masculine]] and would normally take a plural '''-er''' ending in [[Bokm\u00e5l]] and '''-ar''' in [[Nynorsk]]. But since words for foreign currencies (like ''dollar'' and ''yen'') normally do not have the endings '''-er''' or '''-ar''' in Norwegian the [[Norwegian Language Council]] reached a decision in 1996 that the proper declension of the word '''euro''' should be\n\nin Bokm\u00e5l:\n\n:''en euro \u2013 euroen \u2013 euro \u2013 euroene''\n\nin Nynorsk:\n\n:''ein euro \u2013 euroen \u2013 euro \u2013 euroane''\n\nThe declensions are respectively: The two first in [[Grammatical number|Singular]], and the two last in [[Plural]], while the first of each category are [[Article (grammar)|indefinite]], the last of each category are [[Article (grammar)|definite]] nouns. The word '''cent''' is an old loan word in Norwegian \u2013 and it is declined the same way:\n\nin Bokm\u00e5l:\n\n:''en cent \u2013 centen \u2013 cent \u2013 centene''\n\nin Nynorsk:\n\n:''ein cent \u2013 centen \u2013 cent \u2013 centane''\n\nThe pronunciation of the two words in Norwegian are {{IPA-sv|\u02c8\u00e6\u030c\u0289\u027eu|}} and {{IPA|[\u02c8s\u025bnt]}}.\n\n===Romansh===\nIn [[Romansh language|Romansh]], the words are ''euro''<ref name=EuroRomansh>{{cite web |author=Gion-Andri Cantieni |url=http://www.pledarigrond.ch/simpel.php?pled=Euro&lingua=2&metoda=exact&pagina=0 |title=Pledari Grond online |publisher=Pledarigrond.ch |accessdate=25 April 2011 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110707001631/http://www.pledarigrond.ch/simpel.php?pled=Euro&lingua=2&metoda=exact&pagina=0 |archivedate=7 July 2011 |df=dmy-all }}</ref> and ''cent'';<ref name=EuroRomansh/> these are regular masculine nouns forming their plurals with -s, as ''euros'' and ''cents'', respectively.\n\n===Russian===\nRussia currently borders four eurozone members, Finland, Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania. They supply much of the euro inflow in Russia in trade exchange and tourism. In Russian, just like in  [[Bulgarian language|Bulgarian]], euro is spelt \u0435\u0432\u0440\u043e (\"jevro\", pronounced {{IPA-ru|\u02c8jevr\u0259|}}) both in the singular and the plural, while ''cent'' is \u0446\u0435\u043d\u0442 {{IPA-ru|ts\u025bnt|}} (sg.) and \u0446\u0435\u043d\u0442\u044b {{IPA-ru|\u02c8ts\u025bnt\u0268|}} (pl.), though there are many colloquial semi-ironic forms such as \u0435\u0432\u0440\u044b 'jevry' or \u0435\u0432\u0440\u0438\u043a\u0438 'jevriki' (there's no plural form for ''euro'' in Russian), [[Ruble|\u043a\u043e\u043f\u0435\u0439\u043a\u0438]] for cents and others. Just as in Italian, although \u0435\u0432\u0440\u043e could have been declined as a regular neuter noun, it was made indeclinable like many neutral loanwords ending in a vowel: \u0431\u044e\u0440\u043e {{IPA-ru|b\u02b2\u028a\u02c8ro|}} ''bureau, office, writing-desk'', \u043f\u0430\u043b\u044c\u0442\u043e {{IPA-ru|p\u0250l\u02b2\u02c8to|}} ''overcoat'', \u0431\u043e\u0440\u0434\u043e {{IPA-ru|b\u0250r\u02c8do|}} ''Bordeaux wine, claret'' etc.; the same form is used in the singular and the plural. Cents are sometimes transliterated as \u0446\u0435\u043d\u0442 'tsent' \u2013 singular, \u0446\u0435\u043d\u0442\u044b 'tsenty' \u2013 plural. Numerative form is \u0446\u0435\u043d\u0442 for 1 cent (as well as amounts that end in 1 except for the ones ending in 11 \u2013 e.g. 51 \u0446\u0435\u043d\u0442 but 11 \u0446\u0435\u043d\u0442\u043e\u0432), \u0446\u0435\u043d\u0442a, the genitive singular, for 2 to 4 cents (as well as any other amounts ending in 2, 3 or 4, except for the ones ending in 12, 13, 14 \u2013 e.g. 54 \u0446\u0435\u043d\u0442a but 12 \u0446\u0435\u043d\u0442o\u0432) and \u0446\u0435\u043d\u0442o\u0432, genitive plural, for the rest \u2013 88 \u0446\u0435\u043d\u0442o\u0432. Sometimes e\u0432\u0440\u043e\u0446\u0435\u043d\u0442 (also romanized as 'jevrocent' or 'evrotsent') is used to distinguish euro-cents from the American cents. (If \u0435\u0432\u0440\u043e had been treated as a regular neuter noun instead of being indeclinable, it would have the forms *\u0435\u0432\u0440\u0430 (regular plural or genitive singular) and *\u0435\u0432\u0440 (genitive plural), but this treatment would have been unusual for a loanword.)\n\n===Serbian===\nIn [[Serbian language|Serbian]] the euro and cent are called ''evro'' ([[Serbian Cyrillic alphabet|Cyrillic]]: \u0435\u0432\u0440\u043e) {{IPA-sh|e\u028bro|}} and ''cent'' (Cyrillic: \u0446\u0435\u043d\u0442) {{IPA-sh|tsent|}}. ''Evro'' is spelt with a ''v'' because it is derived from the name \u0415\u0432\u0440\u043e\u043f\u0430/''Evropa'' (Europe).\n\nBoth ''evro'' and ''cent'' are masculine nouns. They are inflected according to regular rules of the language:\n\n* When not accompanied by a number, plural quantities are in whatever grammatical case is appropriate to the context: the nominative plurals are ''evri'' (Cyrillic: \u0435\u0432\u0440\u0438) and ''centi'' (Cyrillic: \u0446\u0435\u043d\u0442\u0438).\n* When accompanied by a number ending with the digit 1 (except the combination 11) the singular form is used: ''21 evro'' (Cyrillic: 21 \u0435\u0432\u0440\u043e), ''101 cent'' (Cyrillic: 101 \u0446\u0435\u043d\u0442).\n* When accompanied by a \"small number\", i.e. one ending with the digit 2, 3 or 4 (except the combinations 12, 13, 14), the paucal form is used: ''22 evra'' (Cyrillic: 22 \u0435\u0432\u0440\u0430), ''102 centa'' (Cyrillic: 102 \u0446\u0435\u043d\u0442\u0430).\n* When accompanied by a \"large number\", i.e. one ending with a digit outside the 1\u20134 range (or one ending with any of the combination 11, 12, 13, 14) the genitive plural is used: ''111 evra'' (Cyrillic: 111 \u0435\u0432\u0440\u0430), ''25 centi'' (Cyrillic: 25 \u0446\u0435\u043d\u0442\u0438) or rarely ''25 centa'' (Cyrillic: 25 \u0446\u0435\u043d\u0442\u0430).\n\nThe genitive plural ''centi'' is produced in an old-fashioned way that is today mostly reserved for measurement units. The alternative ''centa'' follows the vastly more common pattern of other masculine nouns but is very rarely heard in practice.\n\n===Turkish===\nTurkey and [[Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus|Northern Cyprus]] continue to use the [[Turkish lira]] as their official currency, but the euro is popularly used, particularly by individuals wanting to convert their savings into a more stable currency. ''Euro'' has colloquially been pronounced in the English fashion since its inception.\n\nIn response to criticism of the widespread English pronunciation of ''euro'', the [[Turkish Language Association]] officially introduced ''avro'' into [[Turkish language|Turkish]] (\"av\" being the first syllable of the Turkish word for Europe, ''Avrupa'') in 1998. A concerted campaign by the Turkish Language Association has begun to blossom in recent years, with most sections of the Turkish media now using the new word. It has yet to enter widespread colloquial use, however.\n\n===Ukrainian===\nThe euro is becoming relatively widespread in [[Ukraine]] although the country did not border the eurozone until 1 January 2009. In standard literary Ukrainian the name is {{lang|uk|\u0454\u0432\u0440\u043e}} ({{IPA-uk|\u02c8j\u025bu\u032fro|pron|uk-\u0454\u0432\u0440\u043e.ogg}}). The same form is used in singular and plural cases. Cents are translated as {{lang|uk|\u0446\u0435\u043d\u0442}} {{IPA-uk|ts\u025bnt||uk-\u0446\u0435\u043d\u0442.ogg}} in the singular and {{lang|uk|\u0446\u0435\u043d\u0442\u0438}} {{IPA-uk|\u02c8ts\u025bnt\u026a|}} in the plural. In the Ukrainian language there is some variation in cases. Numerative form is {{lang|uk|\u0446\u0435\u043d\u0442}} for 1 cent (as well as amounts that end in 1 except for the ones ending in 11 \u2013 e.g. {{lang|uk|51 \u0446\u0435\u043d\u0442}} but {{lang|uk|11 \u0446\u0435\u043d\u0442\u0456\u0432}}), \u0446\u0435\u043d\u0442\u0438 for 2 to 4 cents (as well as any other amounts ending in 2, 3 or 4, except for the ones ending in 12, 13, 14 \u2013 e.g. {{lang|uk|54 \u0446\u0435\u043d\u0442\u0438}} but 12 {{lang|uk|\u0446\u0435\u043d\u0442\u0456\u0432}}) and \u0446\u0435\u043d\u0442\u0456\u0432 for the rest \u2013 {{lang|uk|88 \u0446\u0435\u043d\u0442\u0456\u0432}}. Sometimes {{lang|uk|\u0454\u0432\u0440\u043e\u0446\u0435\u043d\u0442}} {{IPA-uk|\u02c8j\u025bu\u032fro\u02ccts\u025bnt|}} is used to distinguish eurocents from American cents.\n\n== See also ==\n{{Portal bar|Linguistics}}\n\n==Notes==\n{{Reflist|2}}\n\n==External links==\n{{Wiktionary|euro}}\n* [http://evertype.com/standards/euro/ Evertype: Michael Everson: The euro and standardization]\n\n{{Euro topics|state=expanded}}\n\n[[Category:Euro]]\n[[Category:Language policy of the European Union]]\n", "text_old": "{{multiple issues|\n{{More citations needed|date=February 2008}}\n{{cleanup lang|date=May 2019}}\n}}\n{{Use dmy dates|date=July 2015}}\nSeveral [[linguistics|linguistic]] issues have arisen in relation to the spelling of the words '''''[[euro]]''''' and '''''cent''''' in the many languages of the member states of the [[European Union]], as well as in relation to [[grammar]] and the formation of [[plurals]].\n\n<!--Attention: The text of the recommendations in the EC style guides has changed since 2006.

The current design of [[euro banknotes]], except for the \"new\" \u20ac5, \u20ac10, \u20ac20, \u20ac50, and upcoming \u20ac100 banknotes, has the word ''euro'' written in [[Latin alphabet|Latin]] and [[Greek alphabet|Greek]] alphabets. The [[Euro banknotes#Europa series|2013 design of the \u20ac 5 banknote]] introduced Cyrillic, adopting the spelling '''\u0415\u0412\u0420\u041e''', as described below.\nWhen Bulgaria issues Euro coins, if the Greek model is followed, the alternative spelling will go on the national ([[obverse]]) side.\n\nIn popular Bulgarian usage the currency is referred to as \u0435\u0432\u0440\u043e {{IPA-mk|\u02c8\u025bvro|}} and, less often, {{IPA-mk|\u025bv\u02c8ro|}} (from Bulgarian \u0415\u0432\u0440\u043e\u043f\u0430 {{IPA|[\u025bv\u02c8ropa]}}, meaning ''Europe''); the plural varies in spoken language \u2013 \u0435\u0432\u0440\u043e, \u0435\u0432\u0440\u0430 {{IPA|[\u025bv\u02c8ra]}}, \u0435\u0432\u0440\u043e\u0442\u0430 {{IPA|[\u02c8\u025bvrota]}} \u2013 but the most widespread form is \u0435\u0432\u0440\u043e \u2013 without inflection in plural.

The general plural form of euro is ''euri'', but the [[paucal]] or identically written (but not identically pronounced) genitive plural ''eura'' is used with all numbers, thus ''27 eura''. The numbers ending in 1 (e.g. 21 or 101) take the nominative singular, the exception being numbers ending in 11 (e.g. 11 or 111). The examples are: ''21 euro'', ''101 euro'', ''11 eura'', and ''111 eura'' respectively.\n\nThe general plural form of cent is ''centi'' and it is used with most numbers. The numbers ending in 1, except for those ending in 11, take the nominative singular ''cent'', while those ending in 2, 3 and 4 except 12, 13 or 14 take the paucal ''centa''. The examples are: ''1 cent'', ''4 centa'', ''7 centi'', ''10 centi'', ''11 centi'', ''12 centi'', ''22 centa'', ''27 centi'', ''31 cent'', ''101 cent'', ''102 centa'', ''111 centi''.\n\nBoth ''euro'' and ''cent'' in Croatian are of [[masculine gender]].\n\nPronunciation follows the rules of Croatian. ''Euro'' is pronounced {{IPA-sh|euro|}}, while ''cent'' is pronounced {{IPA|[\u02c8tsent]}}.\n\n===Czech===\nIn [[Czech language|Czech]], the words ''euro'' and ''cent'' are spelt the same as in English and pronounced per Czech phonology {{IPA-cs|\u02c8\u025buro|}}, {{IPA|[ts\u025bnt]}}. Occasionally the word ''eurocent'' is used instead of ''cent'' to distinguish the euro denomination versus its foreign counterparts. The spelling differs from the Czech word for Europe (''Evropa''); however \"euro-\" has become a standard prefix for all things relating to the EU (''Evropsk\u00e1 unie'').\n\nThe [[Czech declension]] uses different form of [[plural]] for various numerals: for 2, 3 and 4, it is plain [[nominative]] ''eura'' and ''centy'', while for numbers above 5, [[genitive]] (a vestige of [[partitive]]) ''eur'' and ''cent\u016f'' is used.\n\nFor compound numerals, there are two variants: either genitive plural is used (''21 eur'', ''22 eur'') or the form is determined by the unit part of the numeral (''21 euro'', ''22 eura''). The partitive genitive is used only when the whole numeral phrase is in nominative or accusative phrases, otherwise the expected case is used: ''sedm eur'' (7 euros-genitive), but ''se sedmi eury'' (with seven-instrumental euro-instrumental). Moreover, these otherwise common declensions are often ignored and non-declined ''euro'' is used for every value (''22 euro''), even though this form is [[linguistic prescription|proscribed]].\n\nIn Czech ''euro'' is of [[neuter gender]] and inflected as ''m\u011bsto'', while ''cent'' is masculine and inflected as ''hrad''.\n\n===Danish===\nThe word ''euro'' is included in the 2002 version of ''[[Retskrivningsordbogen]]'',<ref>{{cite web\n |title=''euro'' entry in Retskrivningsorbogen \n |publisher=[[Dansk Sprogn\u00e6vn]] \n |language=Danish \n |url=http://www.dsn.dk/cgi-bin/ordbog/ronet?S.x=0&S.y=0&M=1&P=cent \n |accessdate=17 October 2006 \n |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927235930/http://www.dsn.dk/cgi-bin/ordbog/ronet?S.x=0&S.y=0&M=1&P=cent \n |archivedate=27 September 2007 \n |url-status=dead \n}}</ref> the authoritative source for the [[Danish language]] (according to Danish law). Two plurals are given, ''euro'' when referring to an amount, and ''euroer'' when referring to coins. Both ''cent'' and ''eurocent'' are mentioned; the plural and singular forms are identical.\n\nDanish words of Greek origin containing the sequence ''eu'' are traditionally pronounced with [\u0153\u028a\u032f], e.g. ''Zeus, terapeut, eutanasi, Europa''. However, in the word ''Europa'', a newer pronunciation with [e\u028a\u032f] has gained ground in recent years, but this has not influenced the way ''euro'' is commonly pronounced.{{citation needed|date=January 2014}}\n\n===Dutch===\n'''Plural:''' In [[Dutch language|Dutch]], most abstract [[units of measurement]] are not pluralised, including the former [[Dutch guilder]] (''gulden'' in Dutch) and [[Belgian franc]] (called ''frank'' in Dutch), and now the euro. An amount such as \u20ac5 is pronounced ''5 euro''. This coincides with EU legislation stating that ''euro'' and ''cent'' should be used as both singular and plural. In Dutch, the words are however pluralised as ''euro's'' and ''centen'' when referring to individual coins.\n\nThe euro is divided into 100 ''cent'', as was the guilder. The Belgian franc was divided into 100 ''centiemen''.

Another popular slang term is the plural form ''euri'' ({{IPA|/\u02c8\u00f8\u02d0ri/}}) (or even the [[double plural]] ''euries'' ({{IPA|/\u02c8\u00f8\u02d0ris/}})), a deliberate [[Hypercorrection|hypercorrect]] form referring to the plural of Dutch words of Latin or Italian origin.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://onzetaal.nl/taaladvies/advies/euri |title=euri / euro's - Genootschap Onze Taal |publisher=Onzetaal.nl |date= |accessdate=23 September 2014}}</ref>\n\nIn Belgium, some [[Flemings]] refer to the 1-, 2- and 5-cent coins as ''koper'', which is the Dutch word for copper, the metal these coins are made of (compare [[Nickel (United States coin)|nickel]]). Another nickname is \"ros\" ([[red hair|\"redhead\"]]) or \"roskes\" (\"little redheads\"), referring to the colour of the coins.\n\n'''Syntax:''' In Dutch language print, the [[euro sign]] (\u20ac) is chiefly placed before the amount, from which it is often separated by a (thin) space.<ref name=dutch_valuta>[http://taaladvies.net/taal/advies/vraag/1178 Euro: valutateken voor of achter het bedrag?], Nederlandse Taalunie, retrieved 21 December 2006.</ref> This was also the case with the [[florin sign]] (\u0192).\n\n===English===\nOfficial practice for [[English language|English-language]] EU legislation (not necessarily in national legislation<ref name=\"eurorules\"/>) is to use the words ''euro'' and ''cent'' as both singular and plural.<ref name=\"Spellings_in_Official_Languages\"/> This practice originally arose out of legislation intended to ensure that the banknotes were uncluttered with a string of plurals.

For example, ''quid'' (same in singular and plural), which once referred to an Irish pound (and in the UK still refers to a [[British pound]]) is used as a synonym for ''euro''. Also, ''fiver'' and ''tenner'', which once referred to five and ten pounds respectively, now refer to five and ten euro{{spaced ndash}} either in the sense of the specific [[5 euro note|\u20ac5]] and [[10 euro note|\u20ac10]] banknotes, or in the broader sense of an equivalent sum of money.\n\n====In English-speaking countries outside Europe====\nThe term '''euro-cent''' is sometimes used{{Citation needed|date=April 2009}} in countries (such as Australia, Canada, and the United States) which also have \"cent\" as a currency subdivision, to distinguish them from their local coin. This usage, though unofficial, is mirrored on the coins themselves, which have the words ''EURO'' and ''CENT'' displayed on the common side.\n\n===Finnish===\nThe [[Finnish language|Finnish]] pronunciation for \"euro\" is {{IPA-fi|\u02c8euro|}}. In Finnish, the form ''sentti'' {{IPA-fi|\u02c8sent\u02d0i|}} is used for the cent \u2013 the letter 'c' is generally not used in Finnish, and nativized Finnish words cannot end in consonant combinations like '-nt', therefore an extra vowel 'i' is added. ''euro'' and ''sentti'' are declined like many other existing words ending in ''-o'' and ''-i'', and ''sentti'' displays [[consonant gradation]] (genitive ''euron'', ''sen'''t'''in''). With numerals, the [[partitive case|partitive]] singulars ''euroa'' and ''sentti\u00e4'' are used, e.g., ''10 euroa''. This is abbreviated ''10 \u20ac'', where the ''\u20ac'' symbol takes the role of the word ''euroa'' (never *''\u20ac10'' or *''10\u20ac''). The colon notation (''\u20ac:a'') must not be used with the partitive of ''euro'' when the number is in the nominative. In general, colon notation should be avoided and, for example, one should write ''euron'' or ''euroa'' instead of ''\u20ac:n'' or ''\u20ac:a''.\n\nPlurals (e.g., ''kymmenet eurot'' \"tens of euros\") exist, but they are not used with singular numbers (e.g., ''kymmenen euroa'' \"ten euro\").\n\n''Sentti'' is problematic in that its primary meaning in colloquial language is \"centimeter\". Thus, the officially recommended abbreviation of ''sentti'' is ''snt'', although Finnish merchants generally use a decimal notation (for example ''0,35 \u20ac'').\n\n'''Slang terms:''' In [[Helsinki slang]], a common nickname for euro is ''ege''. In [[Tampere]] slang ''Eero'', a common male name, may be used for euro.\n\n===French===\nIn French, the singular is ''un euro'' (masculine).

Initial letter C is often used in [[loanword]]s and corresponds to various pronunciations depending on the language of origin (e.g. [s] in ''Centime'', {{IPA|[t\u0283]}} in ''Cello'', {{IPA|[ts]}} in ''Celsius'' and [k] in ''Caf\u00e9''). Most of these words are therefore eventually spelt phonetically (e.g. ''Kaffee'', ''Tschechien'' ([[Czech Republic]]), ''Zentimeter'').\n\n[[Latin]] words beginning with \"ce\" such as ''centum'' (hundred) traditionally represent {{IPA|[ts]}} in German, and German words derived from these have therefore long been spelt with a ''Z'', which represents {{IPA|[ts]}} (as in ''Zentrum'' (centre), ''Zentimeter'' (centimetre), etc.). Equivalently, some German speakers pronounce the beginning of the word \"Cent\" {{IPA|[ts]}}, but since they are familiar with the English pronunciation of the American unit ''cent'', most people pronounce it [s].\n\nAs these are nouns, both Euro and Cent are capitalised in German.\n\n'''Slang terms:''' In Austria and Germany, the euro has also been called ''Teuro'', a play on the word ''teuer'', meaning 'expensive'. The [[Deutsche Mark]] was worth half as much as the euro (a ratio of approximately 2:1) and some grocers and restaurants were accused of taking advantage of the smaller numbers to increase their actual prices with the changeover.\n\nIn youth and Internet culture the fake plural ''Euronen'' is sometimes used; this form's origin is unknown but it bears resemblance to ''Dublonen'' ([[Dubloon]]s) and has a [[retro]] ring to it. Also, \"\u00d6re\" is occasionally used, the name of the [[\u00d6re|Swedish currency]]. Among some [[Punk subculture|punks]], the word \"Oi\", as in the punk rock subgenre of [[Oi!]], is used.{{Citation needed|date=August 2009}} Unlike the previous currencies (Mark and Schilling) which had well established nicknames for individual coins and notes, there are few widely used nicknames for Euros, but the two Euro coin is sometimes called ''Zwickel'' like the old two Mark piece and the 50 cent piece is sometimes ironically referred to as \"a rapper\" alluding to [[50 Cent]].{{citation needed|date=January 2017}}\n\nIn German [[Usenet]] culture, the name ''Fragezeichen'' (question mark) was occasionally used in reference to initial problems with display of the [[euro sign]], which was often rendered as a question mark. The term was most often written using the mock currency code FRZ.<ref>{{cite web|title=FRZ als Synonym fuer EUR|url=http://de.etc.sprache.deutsch.narkive.com/TTXv2F4G/frz-als-synonym-fuer-eur|publisher=NARCHIVE: Newsgroup Archive|date=17 February 2005|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141012134239/http://de.etc.sprache.deutsch.narkive.com/TTXv2F4G/frz-als-synonym-fuer-eur|archivedate=12 October 2014|language=German|url-status=live}}</ref> This technical trouble has diminished  and so has the usage of this term.\n\n'''Abbreviations:''' EUR. TEUR for thousand Euros and MEUR for a million Euros are often used in financial documents. Numbers are given with a comma as decimal separator.\n\n===Greek===\nIn the [[Greek language]] the indeclinable word {{lang|el|\u03b5\u03c5\u03c1\u03ce}} ({{IPA-el|ev\u02c8ro|}}) is used as the currency's name. It was decided to use [[omega]] (\u03c9) rather than [[omicron]] (\u03bf) as the last letter of the word, partly because a noun ending with omicron would encourage mutability, and partly to stress the origin of the euro in the Greek word {{lang|el|\u0395\u03c5\u03c1\u03ce\u03c0\u03b7}} (''Eur\u014dp\u0113'', Europe) which is also spelt with omega and it is actually written on the euro notes in Greek as {{lang|el|\u0395\u03a5\u03a1\u03a9}}. Also, the spelling {{lang|el|\u0395\u03a5\u03a1\u039f}} (resulting in a plural {{lang|el|\u0395\u03a5\u03a1\u0391}}) on the notes could have confused other Europeans, who might read it as a string of [[Latin alphabet|Latin]] letters: ''eypo''. A plural form ''evra'', as if from a regular declinable neuter noun in ''-o'', is sometimes used in a jocular way.\n\nFor the cent, the terms used in Greece are {{lang|el|\u03bb\u03b5\u03c0\u03c4\u03cc}}, plural {{lang|el|\u03bb\u03b5\u03c0\u03c4\u03ac}} (''[[Greek lepton|lept\u00f3]]'', plural ''lept\u00e1''), a name used for small denominations of various ancient and modern Greek currencies, including the [[greek drachma|drachma]] (which the euro replaced). The word means '[[minute]]' (literally \"thin\"), the same as the unit of measurement of time or of angle. The term {{lang|el|\u03b5\u03c5\u03c1\u03c9\u03bb\u03b5\u03c0\u03c4\u03cc}}, plural {{lang|el|\u03b5\u03c5\u03c1\u03c9\u03bb\u03b5\u03c0\u03c4\u03ac}} (''evrolept\u00f3'', plural ''evrolept\u00e1'') is sometimes used when a speaker wants to be completely specific that they are referring to money and not time.\n\nSome colloquial names for currency are also in use for the euro. One and two euro coins are respectively called {{lang|el|\u03c6\u03c1\u03ac\u03b3\u03ba\u03bf}} (''frago'') and {{lang|el|\u03b4\u03af\u03c6\u03c1\u03b1\u03b3\u03ba\u03bf}} (''difrago'') from the French ''franc''. A 5 euro banknote is also colloquially called {{lang|el|\u03c4\u03ac\u03bb\u03b7\u03c1\u03bf}} (''taliro'') from the Germanic root ''thaler'' via the Italian ''talero''. A 10 euro banknote is called {{lang|el|\u03b4\u03b5\u03ba\u03ac\u03c1\u03b9\u03ba\u03bf}} (''dekariko''), a 20 euro banknote is called {{lang|el|\u03b5\u03b9\u03ba\u03bf\u03c3\u03ac\u03c1\u03b9\u03ba\u03bf}} (''eikosariko'') or {{lang|el|\u03b5\u03b9\u03ba\u03bf\u03c3\u03ac\u03c1\u03b9}} (''eikosari''), and a 50 euro banknote is called {{lang|el|\u03c0\u03b5\u03bd\u03b7\u03bd\u03c4\u03ac\u03c1\u03b9\u03ba\u03bf}} (''penintariko''), derivatives of the words for ten, twenty and fifty.\n\n10 lepta of a drachma were called {{lang|el|\u03b4\u03b5\u03ba\u03ac\u03c1\u03b1}} (''dekara''), but since lepta of the drachma were out of circulation long before the euro, this word is now considered too old-fashioned and only used in old expressions and thus it is not used for the 10 eurocent coin. Nevertheless, all Greeks understand the word to stand for 10 cents of any currency and thus use it for non-euro currencies like the dime of the US dollar. The same is true for the 5-cent coin which is not called {{lang|el|\u03c0\u03b5\u03bd\u03c4\u03ac\u03c1\u03b1}} (''pentara'') like its drachma equivalent. These words come from the words for five and ten respectively.\n\nIn Cyprus, however, the cent is officially called {{lang|el|\u03c3\u03b5\u03bd\u03c4}} (''cent'') both in singular and plural. This is the name formerly used for {{frac|100}} of the [[Cypriot pound]] chosen for its neutrality to both official languages of the Republic ([[Greek language|Greek]] and [[Turkish language|Turkish]]).{{Citation needed|date=October 2009}}\n\n===Hungarian===\nIn [[Hungarian language|Hungarian]] the currency is named ''eur\u00f3'' ({{IPA-hu|\u02c8\u025buro\u02d0|}}) and ''cent'' ({{IPA-hu|\u02c8t\u0361s\u025bnt|}}) without plural forms (as in Hungarian no plural is used after numerals), the former written with an accented ''\u00f3'', as decided by the [[Magyar Tudom\u00e1nyos Akad\u00e9mia Nyelvtudom\u00e1nyi Int\u00e9zete|Research Institute for Linguistics of the Hungarian Academy of Sciences]].{{cn|date=February 2020}} The spelling is also in accordance with the word ''Eur\u00f3pa'' (\"Europe\") in Hungarian.\n\nHungarian language does not use plural after numerals, as numerals already express plural; however, both ''eur\u00f3'' and ''cent'' can take suffixes regarding to [[grammatical case]]s, just as:\n* Accusative case: ''eur\u00f3t''\n* Dative case: ''eur\u00f3nak''\n* Instrumental case: ''eur\u00f3val'' (\"with euro\")\n* Causative case: ''eur\u00f3\u00e9rt'' (\"for euro\")\n* etc.\n\nOn introduction of the euro, Hungary\u2014along with Lithuania, Latvia, and Slovenia\u2014struggled for the euro to be written in its official documents according to its own usage and spelling, in contrast with Community law, which provides for a single name throughout the Union (in the nominative singular and taking account of different alphabets).<ref>{{cite web|title= Opinion of the European Central Bank of 16 December 2005 at the request of the Slovenian Ministry of Economic Affairs on the provisions of the draft Companies Act concerning redenomination resulting from the introduction of the euro (CON/2005/57)|url = http://www.ecb.int/ecb/legal/pdf/en_con_2005_57_f_sign.pdf |accessdate = 5 April 2009| author=European Central Bank | authorlink = European Central Bank | date = 16 December 2005| publisher=European Communities|quote= [. . .] Article 2 of Council Regulation (EC) No 974/98 of 3 May 1998 on the introduction of the euro2 stipulates that \u2018\u2026 the currency of the participating Member States shall be the euro\u20193.

The [[Accademia della Crusca]] assigned to Severina Parodi, lexicographer, and to [[Luca Serianni]], language historian, the task to give a response. They deliberated in favour of ''euri'' in 1999 with the motivation that \"euro is a masculine noun\". But the issue was then re-examined many times.\nFinally, in 2001 the consensus of the Accademia coalesced in favour of invariability.<ref>[http://forum.accademiadellacrusca.it/forum_8/interventi/3231.shtml Gli euro e le lingue] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080118090255/http://forum.accademiadellacrusca.it/forum_8/interventi/3231.shtml |date=18 January 2008 }}, issue 23 (October 2001) of ''La Crusca per voi'' {{in lang|it}}</ref> The rationale was based on the fact that abbreviated words originating from a longer word (for example ''auto'' from ''automobile'' (car) or ''moto'' from ''motocicletta'' (motorbike)) do not have a plural form, as well as the fact that the word ''euro'' is considered an abbreviation of the word ''Eurovaluta'' (European currency) .

''Euro'', ''c\u00eantimo'' and ''centavo'' are masculine nouns in Portuguese, and as such, \"the cents\" are translated as ''os c\u00eantimos'' and \"those euros\" as ''aqueles euros''.\n\nIn Brazil the pronunciation is {{IPA-pt|\u02c8ew\u027eu|}} (generally {{IPA|[\u02c8eu\u032f\u027eu]}} in Rio de Janeiro and further north, as in Portugal, and {{IPA|[\u02c8e\u028a\u032f\u027e\u028a]}} in S\u00e3o Paulo and further south and west as well as the places [[Portuguese language#Brazil|where southern Brazilians settled]]) and fractional values are called ''centavos de euro''<ref>[http://g1.globo.com/mundo/noticia/2010/07/euros-cunhados-pelo-vaticano-entram-em-circulacao.html \"Euros cunhados pelo Vaticano entram em circula\u00e7\u00e3o na Europa\"]. ''[[O Globo]]''. Retrieved 12 October 2010</ref> (cents of euro) to differentiate them from [[Brazilian real]] \"centavos\".\n\n===Romanian===\nIn [[Romanian language|Romanian]] the euro and cent are called ''euro'' and ''cent'' {{IPA-ro|t\u0361\u0283ent|}} (plural ''{{lang|ro|cen\u021bi}}'' {{IPA-ro|t\u0361\u0283ent\u0361s\u02b2|}}). The official plural of ''euro'' is also ''euro'', and this official form was readily adopted by speakers. The \"eu\" construct is not a diphthong, thus the pronunciation is {{IPA-ro|\u02c8e.uro|}}.\n\nWhen speaking in a familiar\u2013vernacular setting, some speakers would make the informal plural \"euroi\" (not seen as academic, and not used officially; its stylistic value\u2013connotation is less than \"bucks\" for US dollars or \"quid\" for GBP in English and ''much lower'' than the almost everyday use of \"piasse\" (piastre, with the cent called \"sou\") for CAD in Canadian French). The USD also has a nickname (the word \"para\"/\"parai\" of Turkish origin) with the same negative stylistic value. Not to be confused with general nicknames for money in general or unclear nicknames for foreign currencies (e.g.\"coco\" \u2013 the specific currency is supposed to be inferred by the listener from previous info/conversation or from the country the speakers are in).\n\n===Scottish Gaelic===\nDue to the lack of a governing body, there is no consistent usage regarding the terms for euro and cent in [[Scottish Gaelic]]. The various approaches include:\n\n* use of English spellings (including the English plural form and pronunciation), treating the nouns as [[Uninflected word|indeclinable]]: ''an euro'' (genitive ''an euro''; plural ''na euro(s)''), ''an cent'' (genitive ''an cent'', plural ''na cent(s)'')\n* use of English spellings and pronunciation for euro but with Gaelic case marking (both masculine and feminine as the gender of the word has not been determined to date)\n** as a masculine noun: ''an t-euro'' (genitive ''an euro'', plural ''na h-euro(s)'')\n** as a feminine noun: ''an euro'' (genitive ''na h-euro'', plural ''na h-euro(s)'')\n* fully gaelicized forms (based on the Gaelic word ''E\u00f2rpa'' \"Europe\") such as: ''an t-e\u00f2ra'' (genitive ''an e\u00f2ra'', plural ''na h-e\u00f2rathan''), ''an seant'' (genitive ''an t-seant'', plural ''na seantaichean'')<ref>Klevenhaus, M. ''Lehrbuch der schottisch-g\u00e4lischen Sprache'' (2009) Buske Verlag {{ISBN|978-3-87548-520-2}}</ref>\n\n===Slovak===\nIn [[Slovak language|Slovak]] the euro and cent are called ''euro'' and ''cent'', the plural forms for amounts between 2 and 4 are ''2 eur\u00e1/centy'', and the plural forms for larger amounts are ''5 eur/centov''. ''Euro'' is spelt with a ''u'' because it is derived from the word ''Eur\u00f3pa'' (Europe). The c in cent represents {{IPA|/ts/}}.\n\n'''Slang terms:''' common nicknames for euro in Slovak includes: ''eur\u00e1\u010de'', ''evri'', ''jur\u00e1\u0161e'', ''\u00e9\u010dka'' (literally \"e\"-s or \"letters \u2018e\u2019\"). Cents are sometimes jokingly called ''\u0161est\u00e1ky'' (as a common term for coins with small value); ''me\u010f\u00e1ky'' or ''meden\u00e1ky'' (literally \"coppers\" or \"the copper ones\") or ''haliere'' which is a reference to the small coins of the original Slovak currency.\n\n===Slovene===\nIn [[Slovene language|Slovene]] the euro and cent are called ''evro'' and ''cent'' ({{IPA-sl|\u02c8e\u02d0wr\u0254|}}, {{IPA-sl|ts\u025bnt|}}), the dual form is ''2 evra/centa'' ({{IPA-sl|\u02c8e\u02d0wra|}}, {{IPA-sl|\u02c8tse\u02d0nta|}} or {{IPA-sl|\u02c8ts\u025b\u02d0n-|}}) and the plural forms are ''3/4 evri/centi'' ({{IPA-sl|\u02c8e\u02d0wri|}}, {{IPA-sl|\u02c8tse\u02d0nti|}} or {{IPA-sl|\u02c8ts\u025b\u02d0n-|}}), ''5+ evrov/centov'' ({{IPA-sl|\u02c8e\u02d0wr\u0254w|}}, {{IPA-sl|\u02c8tse\u02d0nt\u0254w|}} or {{IPA-sl|\u02c8ts\u025b\u02d0n-|}}), the same declension case being used for all higher numerals up to 100, then beginning again (''101 evro/cent'', ''102 evra/centa'', ''103 evri/centi'', ''104 evri/centi'', ''105 evrov/centov'' etc.). ''Evro'' is spelt with ''v'' according to standard [[Slovene orthography]], and matches the word ''Evropa'' (Europe).\n\nIn laws and regulations, though, the word \u2018evro\u2019 is replaced with the word \u2018euro\u2019 in all grammatical cases in accordance with an agreement between Slovenia and the [[European Union]]. In normative [[Slovene language]] usage \u2018evro\u2019 spelling should only be used, except as noted.<ref>http://www.ecb.int/ecb/legal/pdf/en_con_2006_29_f_sign.pdf</ref>\n\n===Spanish===\nIn the Spanish language, the official plural is the same as its regular plural ''euros''. For the cent, the word ''[[c\u00e9ntimo]]'' (plural ''c\u00e9ntimos'') can be used. The fraction of the [[Spanish peseta|peseta]] was also called ''c\u00e9ntimo'', but no c\u00e9ntimo coins had been issued since 1980, and had since been demonetised. The word \"euro\" is pronounced {{IPA-es|\u02c8eu\u027eo|}} in Spanish, and \"c\u00e9ntimo\" {{IPA-es|\u02c8\u03b8entimo|}} or {{IPA-es|\u02c8sentimo|}}.\n\n'''Slang terms''': the euro is often referred to as ''pavo'', meaning ''turkey'' in English (the usual translation for ''buck'' in dubbed films).\n\n===Swedish===\nIn [[Swedish language|Swedish]] writing, euro is spelt ''euro'' (and cent is spelt ''cent'') both in singular and plural, or written EUR, or \u20ac. The \u20ac sign is common in Finland but rare in Sweden. The currency \"the euro\" is spelt ''euron'' following Swedish grammar rules. There are many Swedish laws mentioning amounts in euro, because of EU directives, using ''euro'' for the amounts and expression like \"belopp i euro\" (amount in euro), not the \u20ac sign.<ref>https://lagen.nu/search/?q=euro</ref>\n\nIn Sweden, the accepted pronunciations are {{IPA-sv|\u02c8\u025b\u030cv(\u02d0)r\u028a|}} (more common and similar to how ''eu'' is pronounced in modern Swedish in ''neuro-'') or {{IPA-sv|\u02c8\u025b\u030c\u0275r\u028a|}} (similar to how ''eu'' is pronounced in modern Swedish in ''Europa'').<ref name=\"Sprakradet\">[http://www.spraknamnden.se/fragor/arkiv_sprakrad_02.htm#euro Swedish Language Council: \"Veckans spr\u00e5kr\u00e5d: Euro\"] Linked 2012-04-29</ref> However, many Swedes choose to pronounce it in a more English way {{IPA-sv|\u02c8j\u01d4\u02d0r\u028a|}} (no ''s'' in plural). This pronunciation is rejected by official authorities, such as the [[Swedish Language Council]],<ref name=\"Sprakradet\"/> and not used in television news. In Sweden there are no widespread slang terms since the euro is a foreign currency.\n\nIn Finland, the euro is the official currency, and Swedish is an official language alongside [[Finnish language|Finnish]]. The same spelling as in Sweden is used (officially [[Finland-Swedish|Swedish in Finland]] is spelt as in Sweden). The pronunciation, however, is {{IPA-sv|\u02c8\u011buro|}}, which has some similarities to [[Finnish language|Finnish]] pronunciation. The abbreviation is like 3,14 \u20ac, same as for Finnish. Among Swedish-speaking as well as Finnish-speaking people in [[Helsinki]], a common slang term is \"ege\".\n\n===Welsh===\nIn [[Welsh language|Welsh]], euro and cent are called ''ewro'' {{IPA-cy|\u02c8\u025bur\u0254|}} (masculine) and ''sent'' {{IPA-cy|s\u025bnt|}} (feminine). The plural forms are respectively ''ewros'' {{IPA-cy|\u02c8\u025bur\u0254s, \u02c8\u025bur\u0254z|}} and ''sentiau'' {{IPA-cy|\u02c8s\u025bntja\u0268, \u02c8s\u025bntjai|}}, although in the Welsh language, numerals are always followed by the singular form of nouns, thus: ''pum ewro'' (\u20ac5), ''deg sent'' (\u20ac0.10). Informally, the more Anglicised {{IPA-cy|\u02c8\u026auro|}} may be used, written either the Welsh way, ''iwro'',<ref>{{cite web|url=https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/wales.cymraeg/MxybMcdO8OY|title=Google Groups|website=groups.google.com}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.scarletfever.org/forum/gwaharddiad-byrnenewyddion-eto_topic22994.html|title=Gwaharddiad Byrne..Newyddion eto ?|publisher=}}</ref> or as in English, ''euro.''<ref>{{cite web|url=http://ygbmalmaen.blogspot.com/2012/06/this-is-jodi-my-blog-is-not-working.html|title=Ysgol Gyfun Bro Morgannwg yn yr Almaen|last=HarrietElias|publisher=}}</ref> The second of these, the native word ''euro'' {{IPA-cy|\u02c8\u025b\u0268r\u0254, \u02c8\u025bir\u0254|}} (\"to gild\") already exists. In Welsh the abbreviation ''c'' stands for ''ceiniog'' (penny).\n\n==Other languages==\n===Albanian===\nIn [[Albanian language|Albanian]], the euro is referred to as \"euro\". This is the same for Albanian in Kosovo, Macedonia and rest of the Balkans. Some Kosovo Albanian speakers however, pronounce euro like Germans; 'oiro'/'oi', due to heavily migration. It is derived from the Albanian word for Europe, \"Europa\", \"Europ\u00eb\" and also \"Evropa\"/\"Evrop\u00eb\". All variants are official in Albanian, however Albania uses Euro, Europa or Europe whilst other Albanian dialects such as in Kosovo, Macedonia, Montenegro and Serbia often use Evrope or Evropa. However the currency euro is not ever pronounced as evro like their Slavic neighbours.\n\nNote: depending on dialect, location, diaspora and ethnicity some [[Albanians]] vary their pronunciations based on standard Albanian, Italian, Greek, German or Slavic (such as those in Macedonia or Serbia).\n\n===Arabic===\nIn Arabic, the euro is usually referred to as {{lang|ar|\u064a\u0648\u0631\u0648}} {{IPA-ar|\u02c8ju\u02d0ro, \u02c8ju\u02d0ru|}}, which is an adaptation of the English pronunciation of the currency's name. Another naming is {{lang|ar|\u0627\u0648\u0631\u0648}} {{IPA-ar|\u02c8\u0294o\u02d0ro|}}, which is an approximation of the French pronunciation {{IPA-fr|\u00f8\u02c8\u0281o|}}. In most cases this term is used both for the singular and the plural form, although the plurals {{lang|ar|\u064a\u0648\u0631\u0648\u0627\u062a}} {{IPA|/ju\u02d0ro\u02c8wa\u02d0t/}} and {{lang|ar|\u064a\u0648\u0631\u0648\u0647\u0627\u062a}} {{IPA|/ju\u02d0ro\u02c8ha\u02d0t/}} are sometimes encountered. The name for Europe in Arabic is {{lang|ar|\u0623\u0648\u0631\u0648\u0628\u0627}} {{IPA|/\u0294o(\u02d0)\u02c8robba, -\u02c8roppa/}}. Because [[loanword]]s are not of [[Classical Arabic|Arabic]] origin, they are pronounced in accordance with the spoken [[varieties of Arabic]] phonology. For example, {{lang|ar|\u0623\u0648\u0631\u0648\u0628\u0627}} is pronounced {{IPA-arz|\u0294o\u02c8\u027eobb\u0251, -\u02c8\u027eopp\u0251|}} by [[Egyptian Arabic]] speakers, while {{IPA|[\u0294o\u02d0\u02c8robba, -\u02c8roppa]}} by [[Levantine Arabic]] speakers.\n\nAttempts to artificially arabize the pronunciation according to the [[Arabic phonology|standardized Arabic phonology]] would be more conforming to [[Arabic transliteration]]s such as ''{{transl|ar|DIN|Y\u016br\u016b / \u02be\u016ar\u016b, \u02be\u016arubb\u0101}}'' which would be theoretically pronounced {{IPA|/\u02c8ju\u02d0ru\u02d0, \u02c8\u0294u\u02d0ru\u02d0, \u0294u\u02d0\u02c8rubba\u02d0/}} for {{lang|ar|\u064a\u0648\u0631\u0648,&lrm; \u0627\u0648\u0631\u0648,&lrm; \u0623\u0648\u0631\u0648\u0628\u0627}}, respectively.\nSee also [[List of diglossic regions#Arabic|Arabic diglossia]] to understand why the pronunciation differs from region to region.\n\n===Armenian===\nThe [[Armenian language|Armenian]] word for euro is {{lang|hy|\u0535\u057e\u0580\u0578}}, pronounced {{IPA-hy|j\u025bv\u02c8\u0279\u0254|}} in exactly the same way as the Greek, with an added initial ''y'' sound. It is derived from the Armenian word for Europe, {{lang|hy|\u0535\u057e\u0580\u0578\u057a\u0561}}, which is pronounced {{IPA-hy|j\u025bv\u0279\u0254\u02c8pa|}}, as stress in Armenian usually falls on the final syllable. Cent in Armenian is pronounced {{IPA-hy|\u02c8t\u0361s\u02b0\u025bnt|}} ({{lang|hy|\u0581\u0565\u0576\u057f}}).\n\nThe plural of euro, in accordance with the formation of plurals in Armenian, is {{lang|hy|\u0535\u057e\u0580\u0578\u0576\u0565\u0580}} {{IPA-hy|\u025bv\u0279\u0254\u02c8n\u025b\u0279|}}. The plural of cent, however, is {{lang|hy|\u0581\u0565\u0576\u057f\u056b}}, pronounced {{IPA-hy|t\u0361s\u02b0\u025bn\u02c8ti|}}.\n\n===Azerbaijani===\nThe [[Azerbaijani language|Azerbaijani]] name for Europe is ''Avropa'', similar to that of its sister language, Turkish, and the Azerbaijani word for euro, derived from that for Europe, is ''avro'', identical to Turkish.\n\n===Chinese===\nIn [[Chinese language|Chinese]], the euro is known as \u6b27\u5143 ([[Simplified Chinese characters|simplified]]), \u6b50\u5143 ([[Traditional Chinese characters|traditional]]), ''\u014duyu\u00e1n'' ([[pinyin]]), from the Chinese word for Europe, \u6b27\u6d32 / \u6b50\u6d32, ''\u014cuzh\u014du'', and the word \u5143 ''yu\u00e1n'', meaning coin. This follows the same pattern as the word for the American dollar \u7f8e\u5143, ''m\u011biyu\u00e1n''. For cents, the word \u6b27\u5206 / \u6b50\u5206 ''\u014duf\u0113n'', is used. However, in [[Hong Kong]] it is often referred to as \u6b50\u7f85 ({{zh|j=au\u00b9lo\u2074}}) to distinguish it from the [[Australian dollar]] (\u6fb3\u5143, {{zh|j=ou\u00b3jyun\u2074}}), because in Cantonese \u6b50\u5143 and \u6fb3\u5143 have similar pronunciations.\n\nAs the character \u5143 in \u6b27\u5143, is a [[Classifier (linguistics)|counter word]] in Chinese, there is no need to put a measure word before the word. An example is: \u4e94\u5341\u6b27\u5143 ([[Chinese numerals|financial Chinese]]: \u4f0d\u62fe\u6b27\u5143) ''w\u01d4sh\u00ed \u014duyu\u00e1n'' for fifty euros.\n\n===Esperanto===\nIn [[Esperanto]], the currency is called '''\"e\u016dro\"''',<ref>[[:eo:E\u016dro]]</ref> similar to the Esperanto word for the continent \"E\u016dropo.\" The ''o'' ending in euro conveniently accords with the standard ''-o'' noun ending in Esperanto, but rather than sound out ''e'' and ''u'' separately, Esperanto speakers use the [[diphthong]] ''e\u016d'', which matches its etymology. Plurals are formed in accordance with Esperanto rules, '''''e\u016droj''''' and '''''cendoj'''''. The words are also declined as any Esperanto noun (e\u016dro/e\u016droj in the [[nominative]], e\u016dron/e\u016drojn in the [[accusative]]). Since the inventor of the name \"euro\" [[Germain Pirlot]] is an Esperantist it is often assumed that he intentionally chose a word that fits well into the Esperanto grammar.\n\nA cent is '''''cendo''''', as is commonly used for subunits of all centimalized currency (cents, centimes, etc.). The alternatives are ''centimo'' from the French ''centime'' or a more technical ''centono'', literally, \"one-hundredth part\". (Esperanto speakers are unlikely to call a cent ''cento,'' since ''cento'' means a group of 100, rather than a hundredth.)\n\n===Faroese===\nIn [[Faroese language|Faroese]] the euro is called '''evra''', a feminine noun derived from the Faroese name of Europe, ''Evropa''; this makes Faroese (with Icelandic<!--Just wrong(?), see Maltese-section: \"and Maltese\"-->) one of only two European languages in which the word for the euro is feminine. The plural is formed regularly: '''evrur'''. The cents are often called '''sent''' which is a neuter word and has the same form in the [[nominative case|nominative]] plural.\n\n===Georgian===\nIn [[Georgian language|Georgian]], the euro is called {{lang|ka|\u10d4\u10d5\u10e0\u10dd}} (''evro'', pronounced {{IPA-ka|\u02c8\u025bvr\u0254|}}), derived from the Georgian word for Europe, {{lang|ka|\u10d4\u10d5\u10e0\u10dd\u10de\u10d0}} {{IPA-ka|\u02c8\u025bvr\u0254p\u02bc\u0251|}}. Unlike in Greek and Armenian, the stress of the word ''evro'' falls on the first syllable, as is usual in Georgian. Cent is {{lang|ka|\u10ea\u10d4\u10dc\u10e2\u10d8}} {{IPA-ka|\u02c8ts\u02b0\u025bnt\u02bci|}}, as nativized Georgian words cannot end in a consonant, so an extra vowel 'i' is added. The respective plurals of euro and cent are {{lang|ka|\u10d4\u10d5\u10e0\u10dd\u10d4\u10d1\u10d8}} {{IPA-ka|\u02c8\u025bvr\u0254\u025bbi|}} and {{lang|ka|\u10ea\u10d4\u10dc\u10e2\u10d4\u10d1\u10d8}} {{IPA-ka|\u02c8ts\u02b0\u025bnt\u02bc\u025bbi|}}.\n\n===Hebrew===\nWhen euro coins and banknotes were introduced, the question of the spelling and pronunciation of the currency's name in Hebrew arose. The official name of the currency established by the [[Academy of the Hebrew Language]] and the [[Bank of Israel]] is {{nowrap|{{Hebrew|\u05d0\u05b5\u05d9\u05e8\u05d5\u05b9}} {{IPA-he|\u02c8e\u0281o|}},<ref>{{cite web|url=http://hebrew-academy.org.il/2010/03/24/%D7%90%D7%99%D7%A8%D7%95-%D7%90%D7%95-%D7%99%D7%95%D7%A8%D7%95/|title=\u05d0\u05d9\u05e8\u05d5 \u05d0\u05d5 \u05d9\u05d5\u05e8\u05d5? - \u05d4\u05d0\u05e7\u05d3\u05de\u05d9\u05d4 \u05dc\u05dc\u05e9\u05d5\u05df \u05d4\u05e2\u05d1\u05e8\u05d9\u05ea|website=hebrew-academy.org.il}}</ref>}} derived from {{nowrap|{{Hebrew|\u05d0\u05b5\u05d9\u05e8\u05d5\u05b9\u05e4\u05b8\u05bc\u05d4}} {{IPA-he|e\u02c8\u0281opa|}} (Europe).}}\n\nAn unofficial spelling and pronunciation {{Nowrap|{{Hebrew|\u05d9\u05d5\u05bc\u05e8\u05d5\u05b9}} {{IPA-he|\u02c8ju\u0281o|}}}}, derived from the English pronunciation of the currency's name, is also used.\n\nAlthough in Hebrew currency names are usually declined for singular and plural, both forms of the Euro name are used for the singular and plural alike.\n\n===Hindi===\nIn [[Hindi]], the euro is spelt as \u092f\u0942\u0930\u094b (Y\u016bro), while cent is written as \u0938\u0947\u0902\u091f (se\u1e47\u1e6d). Both the words are not pluralised. Europe is known as \u092f\u0942\u0930\u094b\u092a (Y\u016brop) in Hindi.\n\n===Icelandic===\nIn [[Icelandic language|Icelandic]] the euro is called ''[[wikt:en:evra#Icelandic|evra]]'', a feminine noun derived from the Icelandic name of Europe, ''[[wikt:Evr\u00f3pa#Icelandic|Evr\u00f3pa]]''; this makes Icelandic (with Faroese<!--Just wrong(?), see Maltese: \"and Maltese\"-->) one of only two European languages in which the word for the euro is feminine. The plural is formed regularly: ''[[wikt:en:evrur#Icelandic|evrur]]''. The cents are often called '''sent''' which is a neuter word and has the same form in the [[nominative case|nominative]] plural. However, a more [[usus|common usage]] is to write, say, 20 cents as ''0,20 evrur''.\n\n===Ido===\nIn [[Ido (language)|Ido]], there is a rule that \"every word pertaining to a national or local custom will get imported to the language without change or adaption, both the singular and the plural forms alike\" (known as ''vorti stranjera'' \u2013 foreign words). This gets especially applied to \"currencies, weights and measurements that don't belong to the [[metric system]]\" (according to KGD, Kompleta Gramatiko Detaloza \u2013 Ido's grammar book). Thus the best word for \"euro\" would be just ''euro'', like ''dollar'' and ''pound'', with the plural probably kept the same: ''euro'', since most languages do that.\n\nIn common speech, though, many Idists commonly refer to the currency as ''euro'' and ''euri'' as if it got fully adopted to the language because of the common use of the currency.\n\nSimilarly, \"cent\" is ''cent'', with the plural imported from its source, English: ''cents''.\n\nFor both words, there are two other possibilities for pluralization. The native plural ''-i'' could be added to the ''vorto stranjera'' with the dash to mark that it's a foreign word: ''cent-i'' and ''euro-i'', or to add the plural definite article ''le'': ''le cent'' and ''le euro'', though that generally means \"the cents\" and \"the euros\".\n\n===Japanese===\nIn Japanese the euro is called \"y\u016bro\" (\u30e6\u30fc\u30ed) based on the English pronunciation, using the [[katakana]] syllabary employed for foreign words. However, the word for Europe in Japanese is \"y\u014droppa\" (\u30e8\u30fc\u30ed\u30c3\u30d1), probably borrowed from the [[Japanese words of Portuguese origin|Portuguese]] ''Europa'' ({{IPA|\u02c8ew.\u027e\u0254p\u0250}}) or from the [[Japanese words of Dutch origin|Dutch]] \"Europa\", not English. The cent uses the same word employed for all currencies using cents. This is rendered \"sento\" (or \u30bb\u30f3\u30c8 in the katakana script) and it is also based on the English pronunciation. In Japanese, like other East Asian languages, no plurals are used for units so both \"y\u016bro\" and \"sento\" are used as the singular and plural.\n\n===Korean===\nIn [[Korean language|Korean]] [[North\u2013South differences in the Korean language|of South Korea]], the Euro is called \"[[Revised Romanization of Korean|yuro]]\" (\uc720\ub85c) and Cent is called \"[[Revised Romanization of Korean|senteu]]\" (\uc13c\ud2b8). The word for Europe in Korean is \"[[Revised Romanization of Korean|Yureop]]\" (\uc720\ub7fd). They are all based on the English pronunciation.\n\n===Latin===\n[[Contemporary Latin|Living Latin]] enthusiasts use ''euro'', -''onis'' (pl. ''eurones''); sometimes also ''euronummus'', ''-i'' (pl. ''euronummi''), ''eurum'', ''-i'' (pl. ''eura'')<ref>[http://www.fondazionecanussio.org/ColloquiaJuliana.pdf ''Colloquia Iuliana''] \u2013 Opus Fundatum Niccol\u00f2 Canussio</ref> or even ''euronus'', ''-i'' (pl. ''euroni'').<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.vaticanradio.org/tedesco/tedarchi/2007/NuntiiLatini/nuntii_latini2007.htm|title=Statio Radiphonica Vaticana \u2013 Nuntii latini|accessdate=25 February 2012|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120713160519/http://www.vaticanradio.org/tedesco/tedarchi/2007/NuntiiLatini/nuntii_latini2007.htm|archivedate=13 July 2012|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\n=== Manx ===\nThe [[Manx language|Manx]] word for \"euro\" is either ''oarey'' (plural: ''oaraghyn''), based on ''Yn Oarpey'' (\"Europe\"), or ''euro'', from English. ''Cent'' is either ''kent'' (plural: ''kentyn'') or ''sent''.\n\n===Norwegian===\nIn [[Norwegian language|Norwegian]] there could be a problem concerning the spelling, since euro is [[Grammatical gender|masculine]] and would normally take a plural '''-er''' ending in [[Bokm\u00e5l]] and '''-ar''' in [[Nynorsk]]. But since words for foreign currencies (like ''dollar'' and ''yen'') normally do not have the endings '''-er''' or '''-ar''' in Norwegian the [[Norwegian Language Council]] reached a decision in 1996 that the proper declension of the word '''euro''' should be\n\nin Bokm\u00e5l:\n\n:''en euro \u2013 euroen \u2013 euro \u2013 euroene''\n\nin Nynorsk:\n\n:''ein euro \u2013 euroen \u2013 euro \u2013 euroane''\n\nThe declensions are respectively: The two first in [[Grammatical number|Singular]], and the two last in [[Plural]], while the first of each category are [[Article (grammar)|indefinite]], the last of each category are [[Article (grammar)|definite]] nouns. The word '''cent''' is an old loan word in Norwegian \u2013 and it is declined the same way:\n\nin Bokm\u00e5l:\n\n:''en cent \u2013 centen \u2013 cent \u2013 centene''\n\nin Nynorsk:\n\n:''ein cent \u2013 centen \u2013 cent \u2013 centane''\n\nThe pronunciation of the two words in Norwegian are {{IPA-sv|\u02c8\u00e6\u030c\u0289\u027eu|}} and {{IPA|[\u02c8s\u025bnt]}}.\n\n===Romansh===\nIn [[Romansh language|Romansh]], the words are ''euro''<ref name=EuroRomansh>{{cite web |author=Gion-Andri Cantieni |url=http://www.pledarigrond.ch/simpel.php?pled=Euro&lingua=2&metoda=exact&pagina=0 |title=Pledari Grond online |publisher=Pledarigrond.ch |accessdate=25 April 2011 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110707001631/http://www.pledarigrond.ch/simpel.php?pled=Euro&lingua=2&metoda=exact&pagina=0 |archivedate=7 July 2011 |df=dmy-all }}</ref> and ''cent'';<ref name=EuroRomansh/> these are regular masculine nouns forming their plurals with -s, as ''euros'' and ''cents'', respectively.\n\n===Russian===\nRussia currently borders four eurozone members, Finland, Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania. They supply much of the euro inflow in Russia in trade exchange and tourism. In Russian, just like in  [[Bulgarian language|Bulgarian]], euro is spelt \u0435\u0432\u0440\u043e (\"jevro\", pronounced {{IPA-ru|\u02c8jevr\u0259|}}) both in the singular and the plural, while ''cent'' is \u0446\u0435\u043d\u0442 {{IPA-ru|ts\u025bnt|}} (sg.) and \u0446\u0435\u043d\u0442\u044b {{IPA-ru|\u02c8ts\u025bnt\u0268|}} (pl.), though there are many colloquial semi-ironic forms such as \u0435\u0432\u0440\u044b 'jevry' or \u0435\u0432\u0440\u0438\u043a\u0438 'jevriki' (there's no plural form for ''euro'' in Russian), [[Ruble|\u043a\u043e\u043f\u0435\u0439\u043a\u0438]] for cents and others. Just as in Italian, although \u0435\u0432\u0440\u043e could have been declined as a regular neuter noun, it was made indeclinable like many neutral loanwords ending in a vowel: \u0431\u044e\u0440\u043e {{IPA-ru|b\u02b2\u028a\u02c8ro|}} ''bureau, office, writing-desk'', \u043f\u0430\u043b\u044c\u0442\u043e {{IPA-ru|p\u0250l\u02b2\u02c8to|}} ''overcoat'', \u0431\u043e\u0440\u0434\u043e {{IPA-ru|b\u0250r\u02c8do|}} ''Bordeaux wine, claret'' etc.; the same form is used in the singular and the plural. Cents are sometimes transliterated as \u0446\u0435\u043d\u0442 'tsent' \u2013 singular, \u0446\u0435\u043d\u0442\u044b 'tsenty' \u2013 plural. Numerative form is \u0446\u0435\u043d\u0442 for 1 cent (as well as amounts that end in 1 except for the ones ending in 11 \u2013 e.g. 51 \u0446\u0435\u043d\u0442 but 11 \u0446\u0435\u043d\u0442\u043e\u0432), \u0446\u0435\u043d\u0442a, the genitive singular, for 2 to 4 cents (as well as any other amounts ending in 2, 3 or 4, except for the ones ending in 12, 13, 14 \u2013 e.g. 54 \u0446\u0435\u043d\u0442a but 12 \u0446\u0435\u043d\u0442o\u0432) and \u0446\u0435\u043d\u0442o\u0432, genitive plural, for the rest \u2013 88 \u0446\u0435\u043d\u0442o\u0432. Sometimes e\u0432\u0440\u043e\u0446\u0435\u043d\u0442 (also romanized as 'jevrocent' or 'evrotsent') is used to distinguish euro-cents from the American cents. (If \u0435\u0432\u0440\u043e had been treated as a regular neuter noun instead of being indeclinable, it would have the forms *\u0435\u0432\u0440\u0430 (regular plural or genitive singular) and *\u0435\u0432\u0440 (genitive plural), but this treatment would have been unusual for a loanword.)\n\n===Serbian===\nIn [[Serbian language|Serbian]] the euro and cent are called ''evro'' ([[Serbian Cyrillic alphabet|Cyrillic]]: \u0435\u0432\u0440\u043e) {{IPA-sh|e\u028bro|}} and ''cent'' (Cyrillic: \u0446\u0435\u043d\u0442) {{IPA-sh|tsent|}}. ''Evro'' is spelt with a ''v'' because it is derived from the name \u0415\u0432\u0440\u043e\u043f\u0430/''Evropa'' (Europe).\n\nBoth ''evro'' and ''cent'' are masculine nouns. They are inflected according to regular rules of the language:\n\n* When not accompanied by a number, plural quantities are in whatever grammatical case is appropriate to the context: the nominative plurals are ''evri'' (Cyrillic: \u0435\u0432\u0440\u0438) and ''centi'' (Cyrillic: \u0446\u0435\u043d\u0442\u0438).\n* When accompanied by a number ending with the digit 1 (except the combination 11) the singular form is used: ''21 evro'' (Cyrillic: 21 \u0435\u0432\u0440\u043e), ''101 cent'' (Cyrillic: 101 \u0446\u0435\u043d\u0442).\n* When accompanied by a \"small number\", i.e. one ending with the digit 2, 3 or 4 (except the combinations 12, 13, 14), the paucal form is used: ''22 evra'' (Cyrillic: 22 \u0435\u0432\u0440\u0430), ''102 centa'' (Cyrillic: 102 \u0446\u0435\u043d\u0442\u0430).\n* When accompanied by a \"large number\", i.e. one ending with a digit outside the 1\u20134 range (or one ending with any of the combination 11, 12, 13, 14) the genitive plural is used: ''111 evra'' (Cyrillic: 111 \u0435\u0432\u0440\u0430), ''25 centi'' (Cyrillic: 25 \u0446\u0435\u043d\u0442\u0438) or rarely ''25 centa'' (Cyrillic: 25 \u0446\u0435\u043d\u0442\u0430).\n\nThe genitive plural ''centi'' is produced in an old-fashioned way that is today mostly reserved for measurement units. The alternative ''centa'' follows the vastly more common pattern of other masculine nouns but is very rarely heard in practice.\n\n===Turkish===\nTurkey and [[Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus|Northern Cyprus]] continue to use the [[Turkish lira]] as their official currency, but the euro is popularly used, particularly by individuals wanting to convert their savings into a more stable currency. ''Euro'' has colloquially been pronounced in the English fashion since its inception.\n\nIn response to criticism of the widespread English pronunciation of ''euro'', the [[Turkish Language Association]] officially introduced ''avro'' into [[Turkish language|Turkish]] (\"av\" being the first syllable of the Turkish word for Europe, ''Avrupa'') in 1998. A concerted campaign by the Turkish Language Association has begun to blossom in recent years, with most sections of the Turkish media now using the new word. It has yet to enter widespread colloquial use, however.\n\n===Ukrainian===\nThe euro is becoming relatively widespread in [[Ukraine]] although the country did not border the eurozone until 1 January 2009. In standard literary Ukrainian the name is {{lang|uk|\u0454\u0432\u0440\u043e}} ({{IPA-uk|\u02c8j\u025bu\u032fro|pron|uk-\u0454\u0432\u0440\u043e.ogg}}). The same form is used in singular and plural cases. Cents are translated as {{lang|uk|\u0446\u0435\u043d\u0442}} {{IPA-uk|ts\u025bnt||uk-\u0446\u0435\u043d\u0442.ogg}} in the singular and {{lang|uk|\u0446\u0435\u043d\u0442\u0438}} {{IPA-uk|\u02c8ts\u025bnt\u026a|}} in the plural. In the Ukrainian language there is some variation in cases. Numerative form is {{lang|uk|\u0446\u0435\u043d\u0442}} for 1 cent (as well as amounts that end in 1 except for the ones ending in 11 \u2013 e.g. {{lang|uk|51 \u0446\u0435\u043d\u0442}} but {{lang|uk|11 \u0446\u0435\u043d\u0442\u0456\u0432}}), \u0446\u0435\u043d\u0442\u0438 for 2 to 4 cents (as well as any other amounts ending in 2, 3 or 4, except for the ones ending in 12, 13, 14 \u2013 e.g. {{lang|uk|54 \u0446\u0435\u043d\u0442\u0438}} but 12 {{lang|uk|\u0446\u0435\u043d\u0442\u0456\u0432}}) and \u0446\u0435\u043d\u0442\u0456\u0432 for the rest \u2013 {{lang|uk|88 \u0446\u0435\u043d\u0442\u0456\u0432}}. Sometimes {{lang|uk|\u0454\u0432\u0440\u043e\u0446\u0435\u043d\u0442}} {{IPA-uk|\u02c8j\u025bu\u032fro\u02ccts\u025bnt|}} is used to distinguish eurocents from American cents.\n\n== See also ==\n{{Portal bar|Linguistics}}\n\n==Notes==\n{{Reflist|2}}\n\n==External links==\n{{Wiktionary|euro}}\n* [http://evertype.com/standards/euro/ Evertype: Michael Everson: The euro and standardization]\n\n{{Euro topics|state=expanded}}\n\n[[Category:Euro]]\n[[Category:Language policy of the European Union]]\n", "name_user": "Nardog", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eSpanish:fixingSpanish IPAperdiscussion", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Language_and_the_euro"}
