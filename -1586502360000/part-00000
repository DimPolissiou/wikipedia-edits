According to some members of Mau Mau, they never referred to themselves as such, instead preferring the military title Kenya Land and Freedom Army (KLFA).<ref name = \"Kanogo 1992 23to25\">{{Harvnb|Kanogo|1992|pp=23\u20135}}.</ref> Some publications, such as Fred Majdalany's ''State of Emergency: The Full Story of Mau Mau'', claim it was an anagram of ''Uma Uma'' (which means \"get out get out\") and was a military codeword based on a secret language-game Kikuyu boys used to play at the time of their circumcision. Majdalany goes on to state that the British simply used the name as a label for the Kikuyu ethnic community without assigning any specific definition.<ref name = \"Majdalany 1963 75\">{{Harvnb|Majdalany|1963|p=75}}.</ref>\n\nAkamba people say the name Mau Mau came from ' Ma Umau' meaning 'Our Grandfathers'. The term was first used during a pastoralists revolt against de-stocking that took place in 1938 led by Muindi Mbingu during which he urged the colonists to leave Kenya so that his people (the kamba) can live freely like the time of  'Our Grandfathers' (Twenda kwikala ta maau mau maitu, tuithye ngombe to Maau mau maitu, nundu nthi ino ni ya maau mau maitu).\n\nAs the movement progressed, a [[Swahili language|Swahili]] [[backronym]] was adopted: \"[[Mzungu]] Aende Ulaya, Mwafrika Apate Uhuru\" meaning \"Let the foreigner go back abroad, let the African regain independence\".<ref name = \"Kariuki 1960 167\">{{Harvnb|Kariuki|1975|p=167}}.</ref> J.M. Kariuki, a member of Mau Mau who was detained during the conflict, postulates that the British preferred to use the term ''Mau Mau'' instead of ''KLFA'' in an attempt to deny the Mau Mau rebellion international legitimacy.<ref name = \"Kariuki 1960 24\">{{Harvnb|Kariuki|1975|p=24}}.</ref> Kariuki also wrote that the term ''Mau Mau'' was adopted by the rebellion in order to counter what they regarded as colonial propaganda.<ref name = \"Kariuki 1960 167\"/>\n\nAnother possible origin is a mishearing of the Kikuyu word for oath \"muuma\".<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://what-when-how.com/religious-movements/mau-mau-religious-movement/|title=MAU MAU (Religious Movement)|website=what-when-how.com|language=en-US|access-date=2018-02-12}}</ref>\n\nAuthor and activist [[Wangari Maathai]] indicates that, to her, the most interesting story of the origin of the name is the Kikuyu phrase for the beginning of a list.

During transit, there was frequently little or no food and water provided, and seldom any sanitation. Once in camp, talking was forbidden outside the detainees' accommodation huts, though improvised communication was rife. Such communication included propaganda and disinformation, which went by such names as the ''Kinongo Times'', designed to encourage fellow detainees not to give up hope and so to minimise the number of those who confessed their oath and cooperated with camp authorities. Forced labour was performed by detainees on projects like the thirty-seven-mile-long South Yatta irrigation furrow.<ref name = \"Elkins 2005 pp154-91\"/> Family outside and other considerations led many detainees to confess.<ref name = \"Peterson 2008 75_76,89,91\">{{Harvnb|Peterson|2008|pp=75\u20136, 89, 91}}: \"Some detainees, worried that the substance of their lives was draining away, thought their primary duty lay with their families.

After their successful dispersion and containment, Erskine went after the forest fighters' source of supplies, money and recruits, i.e. the native Kenyan population of Nairobi.

Between June 1953 and October 1955, the RAF provided a significant contribution to the conflict\u2014and, indeed, had to, for the army was preoccupied with providing security in the reserves until January 1955, and it was the only service capable of both psychologically influencing and inflicting considerable casualties on the Mau Mau fighters operating in the dense forests. Lack of timely and accurate intelligence meant bombing was rather haphazard, but almost 900 insurgents had been killed or wounded by air attacks by June 1954, and it did cause forest gangs to disband, lower their morale, and induce their pronounced relocation from the forests to the reserves.<ref name = \"Chappell 2011\">{{Harvnb|Chappell|2011}}.</ref>\n\nContrary to that which is sometimes claimed, [[Avro Lancaster|Lancaster bombers]] were not used during the Emergency, though [[Avro Lincoln|Lincolns]] were.

These were moved up the Pipeline to special detention camps. Thus a detainee's position in Pipeline was a straightforward reflection of how cooperative the Pipeline personnel deemed her or him to be.

During transit, there was frequently little or no food and water provided, and seldom any sanitation. Once in camp, talking was forbidden outside the detainees' accommodation huts, though improvised communication was rife. Such communication included propaganda and disinformation, which went by such names as the ''Kinongo Times'', designed to encourage fellow detainees not to give up hope and so to minimise the number of those who confessed their oath and cooperated with camp authorities. Forced labour was performed by detainees on projects like the thirty-seven-mile-long South Yatta irrigation furrow.<ref name = \"Elkins 2005 pp154-91\"/> Family outside and other considerations led many detainees to confess.<ref name = \"Peterson 2008 75_76,89,91\">{{Harvnb|Peterson|2008|pp=75\u20136, 89, 91}}: \"Some detainees, worried that the substance of their lives was draining away, thought their primary duty lay with their families.

Men had beer bottles thrust up their rectums, were dragged behind Land Rovers, whipped, burned and bayoneted...

He said that the mistreatment of the detainees is \"distressingly reminiscent of conditions in [[Nazi Germany]] or [[Soviet Union|Communist Russia]]\". Despite this, he said that in order for abuse to remain legal, Mau Mau suspects must be beaten mainly on their upper body, \"vulnerable parts of the body should not be struck, particularly the spleen, liver or kidneys\", and it was important that \"those who administer violence ... should remain collected, balanced and dispassionate\".

Members of the 5th KAR B Company entered the Chuka area on 13 June 1953, to flush out rebels suspected of hiding in the nearby forests. Over the next few days, the regiment had captured and executed 20 people suspected of being Mau Mau fighters for unknown reasons. The people executed belonged to the [[Kikuyu Home Guard]] \u2014 a loyalist militia recruited by the British to fight the guerrillas.

By January 1959, the camp had a population of 506 detainees, of whom 127 were held in a secluded \"closed camp\". This more remote camp near [[Garissa]], eastern Kenya, was reserved for the most uncooperative of the detainees. They often refused, even when threats of force were made, to join in the colonial \"rehabilitation process\" or perform manual labour or obey colonial orders. The camp commandant outlined a plan that would force 88 of the detainees to bend to work. On 3 March 1959, the camp commandant put this plan into action \u2013 as a result, 11 detainees were clubbed to death by guards.<ref>Maloba, Wunyabari O.

It is home of [[New Mexico Military Institute]] (NMMI), founded in 1891. The city is also the location of an [[Eastern New Mexico University]] campus. [[Bitter Lake National Wildlife Refuge]] is located a few miles northeast of the city on the [[Pecos River]]. [[Bottomless Lakes State Park]] is located {{convert|12|mi}} east of Roswell on [[U.S. Route 380|US 380]].\n\nThe [[Roswell UFO incident]] was named after the town, though the crash site of the alleged [[UFO]] was some {{convert|75|mi}} from Roswell and closer to [[Corona, New Mexico|Corona]]. The investigation and debris recovery was handled by the local [[Roswell Army Air Field]]. In the 1930s, Roswell was a site for much of [[Robert H. Goddard]]'s early [[rocket]]ry work. The Roswell Museum and Art Center maintains an exhibit which includes a recreation of Goddard's [[rocket engine]] development workshop.\n\nRoswell's tourism industry is based on [[aerospace engineering]] and [[ufology]] museums and businesses, as well as [[extraterrestrial intelligence|alien]]-themed and [[spacecraft]]-themed iconography. The city also relies on New Mexico and Americana related tourism. Local [[American folk music|American folk]] and [[New Mexico music]] performances occur near Pioneer Plaza and in parks around the city. It is a center for [[acequia]]-similar irrigated farming, dairying, and ranching, it also the location of several manufacturing, distribution, and petroleum related facilities.  This regional pride has resulted in Roswell receiving the [[All-America City Award]] multiple times, in 1978\u201379 and 2002.\n\n==History==\n[[image:Historical-museum.jpg|thumb|left|The White family home, built in 1912, is now a museum.]]\n[[image:Chaves County Courthouse.jpg|thumb|left|The Chaves County courthouse]]\n[[File:Roswell New Mexico Flood.jpg|thumb|left|Roswell flood]]\nThe first non-indigenous settlers of the area around Roswell were a group of pioneers from [[Missouri]], who attempted to start a settlement {{convert|15|mi}} southwest of what is now Roswell in 1865, but were forced to abandon the site because of a lack of water. It was called Missouri Plaza. It also had many Hispanic people from [[Lincoln, New Mexico]]. [[John Chisum]] had his famous Jingle Bob Ranch about {{convert|5|mi|0}} from the center of Roswell, at South Spring Acres. At the time, it was the largest ranch in the United States.\n\nVan C. Smith, a businessman from [[Omaha, Nebraska]], and his partner, Aaron Wilburn, constructed two [[adobe]] buildings in 1869 that began what is now Roswell. The two buildings became the settlement's general store, post office, and sleeping quarters for paying guests. In 1871, Smith filed a claim with the federal government for the land around the buildings, and on August 20, 1873, he became the town's first [[postmaster]]. Smith was the son of Roswell Smith, a prominent lawyer in [[Lafayette, Indiana]], and Annie Ellsworth, daughter of U.S. Patent Commissioner [[Henry Leavitt Ellsworth]]. He called the town Roswell, after his father's first name.\n\nIn 1877, Captain Joseph Calloway Lea and his family bought out Smith and Wilburn's claim and became the owners of most of the land of Roswell and the area surrounding it. The town was relatively quiet during the [[Lincoln County War]] (1877\u20131879). A major [[aquifer]] was discovered when merchant Nathan Jaffa had a well drilled in his back yard on Richardson Avenue in 1890, resulting in the area's first major growth and development spurt. The growth continued when a railroad was built through town in 1893.\n\nDuring World War II, a [[prisoner-of-war camp]] was located in nearby [[Orchard Park, New Mexico|Orchard Park]]. The German prisoners of war were used to do major infrastructure work in Roswell, such as paving the banks of the [[North Spring River]]. Some POWs used rocks of different sizes to create the outline of an [[iron cross]] among the stones covering the north bank. Later, the iron cross was covered with a thin layer of concrete. In the 1980s, a crew cleaning the river bed cleared off the concrete and revealed the outline once more. The small park just south of the cross was then known as Iron Cross Park. On November 11, 1996, the park was renamed POW/MIA Park. The park displays a piece of the [[Berlin Wall]], presented to the city of Roswell by the [[German Air Force]].\n\nRoswell was a location of military importance from 1941 to 1967. In 1967, the [[Walker Air Force Base]] was decommissioned. After the closure of the base, Roswell capitalized on its pleasant climate and reinvented itself as a [[retirement community]].\n\n[[Image:RoswellDailyRecordJuly8,1947.jpg|thumb|right|200px|''[[Roswell Daily Record]]'', July 8, 1947, announcing the \"capture\" of a \"flying saucer\"]]\n[[Image:International UFO Museum and Research Center Roswell New Mexico.jpg|right|thumb|200px|[[International UFO Museum]]]]\n\nRoswell has benefited from interest in the alleged [[Roswell UFO incident|UFO incident of 1947]]. It was the report of an object that crashed in the general vicinity in June or July 1947, allegedly an [[extraterrestrial spacecraft]] and its [[Extraterrestrial life|alien]] occupants. Since the late 1970s, the incident has been the subject of intense controversy and of a [[conspiracy theory]] regarding a classified program named \"[[Project Mogul|Mogul]]\". Many [[Unidentified flying object|UFO]] proponents maintain that an alien craft was found and its occupants were captured, and that the military then engaged in a cover-up. In recent times, the business community has deliberately sought out tourists interested in UFOs, science fiction, and aliens.\n\nRoswell hosted the [[Red Bull Stratos|record-breaking skydive]] by [[Felix Baumgartner]] on October 14, 2012.<ref>{{cite news| last=Llorca| first=Juan| title=Felix Baumgartner Completes Record-Setting Jump| url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/10/14/felix-baumgartner-jump-redbull-skydive_n_1965299.html| work=Huffington Post| accessdate=October 17, 2012| date=October 14, 2012}}</ref>\n\n==Geography==\nRoswell is located in southeastern [[New Mexico]], approximately {{convert|7|mi|0|abbr=on}} west of the [[Pecos River]] and some {{convert|40|mi|abbr=on}} east of highlands that rise to the [[Sierra Blanca (New Mexico)|Sierra Blanca]] range. U.S. Routes [[U.S. Route 70 in New Mexico|70]], [[U.S. Route 285 (New Mexico)|285]] and [[U.S. Route 380 (New Mexico)|380]] intersect in the city. US 70 leads northeast {{convert|111|mi|abbr=on}} to [[Clovis, New Mexico|Clovis]] and {{convert|117|mi|abbr=on}} west to [[Alamogordo, New Mexico|Alamogordo]]; US 285 leads north {{convert|192|mi|abbr=on}} to [[Santa Fe, New Mexico|Santa Fe]] and south {{convert|76|mi|abbr=on}} to [[Carlsbad, New Mexico|Carlsbad]]; and US 380 leads east {{convert|134|mi|abbr=on}} to [[Brownfield, Texas]], and west {{convert|164|mi|abbr=on}} to [[Socorro, New Mexico|Socorro]].\n\nAccording to the [[United States Census Bureau]], Roswell has a total area of {{convert|77.5|km2|order=flip}}, of which {{convert|77.3|km2|order=flip}} is land and {{convert|0.1|km2|order=flip|2}}, or 0.19%, is covered by water.<ref name=\"Census 2010\"/>\n[[File:Main Street Roswell.jpg|left|thumb|250px|Main Street]]\n\n===Climate===\nRoswell is located in the [[High Plains (United States)|High Plains]] and has four very distinct seasons, giving it a ''BSk'' or ''BSh'' [[semiarid climate]] according to the [[K\u00f6ppen climate classification]]. Winters are cold, but usually sunny, and [[snowfall]] is a common occurrence. Spring is mild and usually warm, but can still be cold on occasion. Summers are hot (as is common with the High Plains of New Mexico and [[Colorado]]) and, quite frequently, the temperature rises above 100&nbsp;\u00b0F, which can be unpleasant. The North American [[monsoon]] occurs during the summer, and can bring torrential downpours, severe [[thunderstorms]] (with high winds and [[hail]]) and sometimes even [[tornadoes]]. The rain can provide a cooling relief from the scorching great plains heat. Fall is mild and pleasant, but can be cold. Snow is possible in October and November.\n\nThe record low in Roswell is {{convert|-24|F|0}} on January 11, 1962 and February 8, 1933.<ref name = NOAA/> The record high is {{convert|114|F|0}} on June

It is home of [[New Mexico Military Institute]] (NMMI), founded in 1891. The city is also the location of an [[Eastern New Mexico University]] campus. [[Bitter Lake National Wildlife Refuge]] is located a few miles northeast of the city on the [[Pecos River]]. [[Bottomless Lakes State Park]] is located {{convert|12|mi}} east of Roswell on [[U.S. Route 380|US 380]].\n\nThe [[Roswell UFO incident]] was named after the town, though the crash site of the alleged [[UFO]] was some {{convert|75|mi}} from Roswell and closer to [[Corona, New Mexico|Corona]]. The investigation and debris recovery was handled by the local [[Roswell Army Air Field]]. In the 1930s, Roswell was a site for much of [[Robert H. Goddard]]'s early [[rocket]]ry work. The Roswell Museum and Art Center maintains an exhibit which includes a recreation of Goddard's [[rocket engine]] development workshop.\n\nRoswell's tourism industry is based on [[aerospace engineering]] and [[ufology]] museums and businesses, as well as [[extraterrestrial intelligence|alien]]-themed and [[spacecraft]]-themed iconography. The city also relies on New Mexico and Americana related tourism. Local [[American folk music|American folk]] and [[New Mexico music]] performances occur near Pioneer Plaza and in parks around the city. It is a center for [[acequia]]-similar irrigated farming, dairying, and ranching, it also the location of several manufacturing, distribution, and petroleum related facilities.  This regional pride has resulted in Roswell receiving the [[All-America City Award]] multiple times, in 1978\u201379 and 2002.\n\n==History==\n[[image:Historical-museum.jpg|thumb|left|The White family home, built in 1912, is now a museum.]]\n[[image:Chaves County Courthouse.jpg|thumb|left|The Chaves County courthouse]]\n[[File:Roswell New Mexico Flood.jpg|thumb|left|Roswell flood]]\nThe first non-indigenous settlers of the area around Roswell were a group of pioneers from [[Missouri]], who attempted to start a settlement {{convert|15|mi}} southwest of what is now Roswell in 1865, but were forced to abandon the site because of a lack of water. It was called Missouri Plaza. It also had many Hispanic people from [[Lincoln, New Mexico]]. [[John Chisum]] had his famous Jingle Bob Ranch about {{convert|5|mi|0}} from the center of Roswell, at South Spring Acres. At the time, it was the largest ranch in the United States.\n\nVan C. Smith, a businessman from [[Omaha, Nebraska]], and his partner, Aaron Wilburn, constructed two [[adobe]] buildings in 1869 that began what is now Roswell. The two buildings became the settlement's general store, post office, and sleeping quarters for paying guests. In 1871, Smith filed a claim with the federal government for the land around the buildings, and on August 20, 1873, he became the town's first [[postmaster]]. Smith was the son of Roswell Smith, a prominent lawyer in [[Lafayette, Indiana]], and Annie Ellsworth, daughter of U.S. Patent Commissioner [[Henry Leavitt Ellsworth]]. He called the town Roswell, after his father's first name.\n\nIn 1877, Captain Joseph Calloway Lea and his family bought out Smith and Wilburn's claim and became the owners of most of the land of Roswell and the area surrounding it. The town was relatively quiet during the [[Lincoln County War]] (1877\u20131879). A major [[aquifer]] was discovered when merchant Nathan Jaffa had a well drilled in his back yard on Richardson Avenue in 1890, resulting in the area's first major growth and development spurt. The growth continued when a railroad was built through town in 1893.\n\nDuring World War II, a [[prisoner-of-war camp]] was located in nearby [[Orchard Park, New Mexico|Orchard Park]]. The German prisoners of war were used to do major infrastructure work in Roswell, such as paving the banks of the [[North Spring River]]. Some POWs used rocks of different sizes to create the outline of an [[iron cross]] among the stones covering the north bank. Later, the iron cross was covered with a thin layer of concrete. In the 1980s, a crew cleaning the river bed cleared off the concrete and revealed the outline once more. The small park just south of the cross was then known as Iron Cross Park. On November 11, 1996, the park was renamed POW/MIA Park. The park displays a piece of the [[Berlin Wall]], presented to the city of Roswell by the [[German Air Force]].\n\nRoswell was a location of military importance from 1941 to 1967. In 1967, the [[Walker Air Force Base]] was decommissioned. After the closure of the base, Roswell capitalized on its pleasant climate and reinvented itself as a [[retirement community]].\n\n[[Image:RoswellDailyRecordJuly8,1947.jpg|thumb|right|200px|''[[Roswell Daily Record]]'', July 8, 1947, announcing the \"capture\" of a \"flying saucer\"]]\n[[Image:International UFO Museum and Research Center Roswell New Mexico.jpg|right|thumb|200px|[[International UFO Museum]]]]\n\nRoswell has benefited from interest in the alleged [[Roswell UFO incident|UFO incident of 1947]]. It was the report of an object that crashed in the general vicinity in June or July 1947, allegedly an [[extraterrestrial spacecraft]] and its [[Extraterrestrial life|alien]] occupants. Since the late 1970s, the incident has been the subject of intense controversy and of a [[conspiracy theory]] regarding a classified program named \"[[Project Mogul|Mogul]]\". Many [[Unidentified flying object|UFO]] proponents maintain that an alien craft was found and its occupants were captured, and that the military then engaged in a cover-up. In recent times, the business community has deliberately sought out tourists interested in UFOs, science fiction, and aliens.\n\nRoswell hosted the [[Red Bull Stratos|record-breaking skydive]] by [[Felix Baumgartner]] on October 14, 2012.<ref>{{cite news| last=Llorca| first=Juan| title=Felix Baumgartner Completes Record-Setting Jump| url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/10/14/felix-baumgartner-jump-redbull-skydive_n_1965299.html| work=Huffington Post| accessdate=October 17, 2012| date=October 14, 2012}}</ref>\n\n==Geography==\nRoswell is located in southeastern [[New Mexico]], approximately {{convert|7|mi|0|abbr=on}} west of the [[Pecos River]] and some {{convert|40|mi|abbr=on}} east of highlands that rise to the [[Sierra Blanca (New Mexico)|Sierra Blanca]] range. U.S. Routes [[U.S. Route 70 in New Mexico|70]], [[U.S. Route 285 (New Mexico)|285]] and [[U.S. Route 380 (New Mexico)|380]] intersect in the city.

Winters are cold, but usually sunny, and [[snowfall]] is a common occurrence. Spring is mild and usually warm, but can still be cold on occasion. Summers are hot (as is common with the High Plains of New Mexico and [[Colorado]]) and, quite frequently, the temperature rises above 100&nbsp;\u00b0F, which can be unpleasant. The North American [[monsoon]] occurs during the summer, and can bring torrential downpours, severe [[thunderstorms]] (with high winds and [[hail]]) and sometimes even [[tornadoes]]. The rain can provide a cooling relief from the scorching great plains heat. Fall is mild and pleasant, but can be cold. Snow is possible in October and November.\n\nThe record low in Roswell is {{convert|-24|F|0}} on January 11, 1962 and February 8, 1933.<ref name = NOAA/> The record high is {{convert|114|F|0}} on June

For about two days the storm stalled just inland, dropping very heavy rainfall and causing widespread flash flooding. Harvey's center drifted back towards the southeast, ultimately re-emerging into the [[Gulf of Mexico]] on August 28. Once offshore, the poorly organized system struggled against strong wind shear. Deep convection persisted north of the cyclone's center near the [[Houston metropolitan area]] along a [[stationary front]], resulting in several days of record-breaking rain.

Associated convection with Harvey became focused north of the center and along a warm front on September&nbsp;1 as it moved further inland, indicating that the system transitioned into a post-tropical cyclone by 06:00&nbsp;UTC that day.

An estimated 300,000&nbsp;structures and 500,000&nbsp;vehicles were damaged or destroyed in Texas alone. The [[National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration]] estimated total damage at $125&nbsp;billion, with a 90% confidence interval of $90\u2013160&nbsp;billion. The scope of flooding in areas with low [[National Flood Insurance Program]] (NFIP) participation lends to the large uncertainty in the damage total. This ranks Harvey as the costliest tropical cyclone on record in the country alongside [[Hurricane Katrina]] in 2005. However, accounting for inflation and cost increases since 2005, the National Hurricane Center considers Harvey the second-costliest.<ref name=\"TCR\"/> Nationwide, 107&nbsp;people died in storm-related incidents: 103 in Texas, 2 in Arkansas, 1 in Tennessee, and 1 in Kentucky.

Harvey's center drifted back towards the southeast, ultimately re-emerging into the [[Gulf of Mexico]] on August 28. Once offshore, the poorly organized system struggled against strong wind shear. Deep convection persisted north of the cyclone's center near the [[Houston metropolitan area]] along a [[stationary front]], resulting in several days of record-breaking rain. Early on August&nbsp;30, the former hurricane made its fifth and final landfall just west of [[Cameron, Louisiana]] with winds of 45&nbsp;mph (75&nbsp;km/h).

An estimated 300,000&nbsp;structures and 500,000&nbsp;vehicles were damaged or destroyed in Texas alone. The [[National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration]] estimated total damage at $125&nbsp;billion, with a 90% confidence interval of $90\u2013160&nbsp;billion. The scope of flooding in areas with low [[National Flood Insurance Program]] (NFIP) participation lends to the large uncertainty in the damage total. This ranks Harvey as the costliest tropical cyclone on record in the country alongside [[Hurricane Katrina]] in 2005. However, accounting for inflation and cost increases since 2005, the National Hurricane Center considers Harvey the second-costliest.<ref name=\"TCR\"/> Nationwide, 107&nbsp;people died in storm-related incidents: 103 in Texas, 2 in Arkansas, 1 in Tennessee, and 1 in Kentucky.
