In 1831 citizens rioted in protest against the [[Duke of Newcastle]]'s opposition to the [[Reform Act 1832]], setting fire to his residence, [[Nottingham Castle]].\n\n[[File:Nottingham Map 1831 by Staveley and Wood.jpg|thumb|Nottingham in 1831]]\nIn common with the UK textile industry, Nottingham's textile sector fell into decline in the decades following World War II. {{Citation needed|date=December 2014}}  Little textile manufacture now takes place in Nottingham; however, many of the former industrial buildings in the Lace Market district have been restored and put to new uses.\n\nNottingham was one of the boroughs reformed by the [[Municipal Corporations Act 1835]], and at that time consisted of the parishes of St Mary, St Nicholas and St Peter. It was expanded in 1877 by adding the parishes of [[Basford, Nottingham|Basford]], Brewhouse Yard, [[Bulwell]], [[Radford, Nottingham|Radford]], [[Sneinton]], Standard Hill, and parts of the parishes of [[West Bridgford]], [[Carlton, Nottinghamshire|Carlton]], [[Wilford, Nottinghamshire|Wilford]] (North Wilford). In 1889 Nottingham became a [[county borough]] under the [[Local Government Act 1888]]. City status was awarded as part of the Diamond Jubilee celebrations of Queen Victoria, being signified in a letter from the prime minister, the [[Robert Cecil, 3rd Marquess of Salisbury|Marquess of Salisbury]] to the mayor, dated 18 June 1897. Nottingham was extended in 1933 by adding [[Bilborough]] and [[Wollaton]], parts of the parishes of Bestwood Park and [[Colwick]], and a recently developed part of the [[Beeston Urban District]]. A further boundary extension was granted in 1951 when Clifton and Wilford (south of the River Trent) were incorporated into the city.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.visionofbritain.org.uk/relationships.jsp?u_id=10001389&c_id=10001043 |title=Relationships / unit history of Nottingham |accessdate=22 March 2007 |publisher=A Vision of Britain Through Time |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070930235913/http://www.visionofbritain.org.uk/relationships.jsp?u_id=10001389&c_id=10001043 |archivedate=30 September 2007  }}</ref><ref name=localhist>{{cite web |url=http://www.localhistories.org/nottingham.html |title=A Brief History of Nottingham, England |author=Tim Lambert |accessdate=12 July 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120622224124/http://www.localhistories.org/nottingham.html |archive-date=22 June 2012 |url-status=live }}</ref>\n\n{{historical populations\n|title = Demographic evolution of Nottingham\n|cols = 2 | align = center|percentages=off\n|4th century|&lt;37\n|10th century|&lt;1,000\n|11th century|1,500\n|14th century|3,000\n|Early 17th century|4,000\n|Late 17th century|5,000\n}}\n{{historical populations\n|title = <nowiki />\n|cols = 3 | align = center\n|1801|29,000\n|1811|34,000\n|1821|40,000\n|1831|51,000\n|1841|53,000\n|1851|58,000\n|1861|76,000\n|1871|87,000\n|1881|159,000\n|1901|240,000\n|1911|260,000\n|1921|269,000\n|1931|265,000\n|1951|306,000\n|1961|312,000\n|1971|301,000\n|1981|278,000\n|1991|273,000\n|2001|275,000\n}}\nElectric trams were introduced to the city in 1901; they served the city for 35 years until 1936.

South of the river there has also been expansion with new areas such as Edwalton and West Bridgford, adding to Nottingham's [[urban sprawl]]. Although this growth slowed towards the end of the century, the modern pressures for more affordable and council housing is back on the political agenda and there is now pressure on the [[green belt]] which surrounds the city.{{citation needed|date=October 2013}}\n\n==Government==\n\n===Local government===\n[[File:Council-House-Nottingham.jpg|thumb|right|[[Nottingham Council House]]]]\n\nThere are two major local authorities that serve the Nottingham area. These are [[Nottingham City Council]] and [[Nottinghamshire County Council]].\n\n[[Nottingham City Council]] is a [[unitary authority]] based at [[Loxley House, Nottingham]] on Station Street. It consists of 55 [[councillors]], representing 20 [[Ward (politics)|wards]], who are elected every four years; the last elections being held on [[2015 Nottingham City Council election|7 May 2015]].\n\nThe city also has a [[Lord Mayor of Nottingham|Lord Mayor]] who is selected by city councillors from among themselves. The position is largely ceremonial but the Lord Mayor also acts as Chair of Full Council meetings.\n\nThe City of Nottingham's boundaries are tightly drawn and exclude several suburbs and satellite towns that are usually considered part of [[Greater Nottingham]]. Unlike the City, these areas are governed by a two tier system of local government. [[Nottinghamshire County Council]] (based at [[County Hall, Nottinghamshire|County Hall]]), provides the upper tier of local government whilst the lower tier is split into several district or borough councils. The County Council are responsible for Health, Social Care, Education, Highways, Transport, Libraries and Trading Standards, whilst the lower tier councils are responsible for local planning, neighbourhood services, housing, licensing, environmental health and leisure facilities. The western suburbs of [[Beeston, Nottinghamshire|Beeston]], [[Stapleford, Nottinghamshire|Stapleford]] and [[Eastwood, Nottinghamshire|Eastwood]] are administered by [[Broxtowe Borough Council]]. Further west still, the Nottingham urban district extends into [[Derbyshire]] where [[Ilkeston]] and [[Long Eaton]] are administered by [[Erewash Borough Council]], and [[Ripley, Derbyshire|Ripley]] by [[Amber Valley]]. To the north, [[Hucknall]] is controlled by [[Ashfield District Council]], while in the east [[Arnold, Nottinghamshire|Arnold]] and [[Carlton, Nottinghamshire|Carlton]] form part of the [[Borough of Gedling]]. South of the river, the suburb of [[West Bridgford, Nottinghamshire|West Bridgford]] lies in [[Rushcliffe]], as do the outlying villages of [[Ruddington]] and [[Tollerton, Nottinghamshire|Tollerton]] and the town of [[Bingham, Nottinghamshire|Bingham]].\n[[File:GreaterNottingham-map.png|thumb|Map illustrating the boundaries of the city and the wider [[Greater Nottingham]] area]]\n\n===UK Parliament===\nNottingham has three UK parliamentary [[constituency]] seats within its boundaries.

Completely encircling the city, it extends for several miles into the surrounding districts, as well as towards Derby.\n\n==Architecture==\nThe geographical centre of Nottingham is usually defined as the [[Old Market Square]].{{Citation needed|date=February 2016}} The square is dominated by the [[Nottingham Council House|Council House]], which replaced the Nottingham Exchange Building, built in 1726. The Council House was built in the 1920s to display civic pride, ostentatiously using [[baroque]] columns and placing stone statues of two lions at the front to stand watch over the square. The [[Exchange Arcade]], on the ground floor, is an upmarket shopping centre containing boutiques.\n\n[[File:Byron house 2.JPG|thumb|Nottingham Trent University, Arkwright Building]]\n\nTall office buildings line Maid Marian Way. The Georgian area around Oxford and Regent Streets is dominated by small professional firms. The [[Albert Hall, Nottingham|Albert Hall]] faces the [[gothic revival architecture|Gothic revival]] [[Nottingham Cathedral|St Barnabas' Roman Catholic Cathedral]] by [[Augustus Welby Northmore Pugin|Pugin]]. [[Nottingham Castle]] and its grounds are located further south in the western third of the city. The central third descends from the University district in the north, past [[Nottingham Trent University]]'s Gothic revival Arkwright Building. The university also owns many other buildings in this area. The Theatre Royal on Theatre Square, with its pillared fa\u00e7ade, was built in 1865. King and Queen Streets are home to striking [[Victorian architecture|Victorian]] buildings designed by such architects as [[Alfred Waterhouse]] and [[Watson Fothergill]].{{citation needed|date=November 2013}}\n\nTo the south, is [[Broadmarsh Shopping Centre]]. The Canal-side further south of this is adjacent to [[Nottingham railway station]] and home to numerous redeveloped 19th-century industrial buildings, reused as bars and restaurants.{{citation needed|date=November 2013}}\n\nThe eastern third of the city centre contains the Victoria Shopping Centre, built in the 1970s on the site of the demolished Victoria Railway Station. All that remains of the old station is the clock tower and the station hotel, now the Nottingham Hilton Hotel. The 250-foot-high Victoria Centre flats stand above the shopping centre and are the tallest buildings in the city. The eastern third contains [[Hockley Village]]. Hockley is where many of Nottingham's unique, independent shops are to be found. It is also home to two alternative cinemas.\n\n===Lace Market===\n[[File:Lace market justice galleries.JPG|thumb|National Justice Museum in the Lace Market]]\n\nThe [[Lace Market]] area just south of [[Hockley, Nottingham|Hockley]] has streets with four- to seven-storey red brick warehouses, [[iron railing]]s and [[Red telephone box|red phone boxes]].\n\nMany of the buildings have been converted into apartments, bars and restaurants. The largest building in the Lace Market is the [[The Adams Building Nottingham|Adams Building]], built by [[Thomas Chambers Hine]] for [[Thomas Adams (manufacturer and philanthropist)|Thomas Adams]] (1807\u20131873), and currently used by [[Nottingham College]]. The Georgian-built Shire Hall, which was once Nottingham's main [[courtroom|court]] and [[prison]] building, is now home to the [[National Justice Museum]] (formerly the \"Galleries of Justice\").\n\n===Public houses===\n''[[Ye Olde Trip To Jerusalem]]'' (the ''Trip''), partially built into the cave system beneath Nottingham Castle, is a contender for the title of England's Oldest Pub, as it is supposed to have been established in 1189.<ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/nottingham/entertainment/pubs/trip.shtml| title=Nottingham \u2013 Pubs| accessdate=4 December 2014| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140621045656/http://www.bbc.co.uk/nottingham/entertainment/pubs/trip.shtml| archive-date=21 June 2014| url-status=live}}</ref> ''[[The Bell Inn, Nottingham|The Bell Inn]]'' in the Old Market Square, and ''[[Ye Olde Salutation Inn]]'' (the ''Salutation'') in Maid Marian Way have both disputed this claim.

From around AD 1100 Nottingham was part of the [[Diocese of Lichfield]], controlled as an [[List of Archdeacons of Nottingham|archdeaconry]] from [[Lichfield Cathedral]] in Staffordshire. However, in 1837 the archdeaconry was placed under the control of the [[Diocese of Lincoln]].

The bishop is based at [[Southwell Minster]], {{convert|14|mi|0}} north-east of the city.\n\nDespite not having a cathedral, Nottingham has three notable historic [[Anglican parish church]]es, all of which date back to the [[Middle Ages]].

The church dates from the eighth or ninth centuries, but the present building is at least the third on the site, dating primarily from 1377 to 1485. St. Mary's is considered the mother church of the city and civic services are held here, including the welcome to the new [[Lord Mayor of Nottingham]] each year. It is a member of the [[Greater Churches Group]]. [[St. Peter's Church, Nottingham|St. Peter's]] in the heart of the city is the oldest building in continuous use in Nottingham, with traces of building starting in 1180. [[St. Nicholas' Church, Nottingham|St. Nicholas']] is the third.\n\nA variety of chapels and meeting rooms are in the town.

In 1831 citizens rioted in protest against the [[Duke of Newcastle]]'s opposition to the [[Reform Act 1832]], setting fire to his residence, [[Nottingham Castle]].\n\n[[File:Nottingham Map 1831 by Staveley and Wood.jpg|thumb|Nottingham in 1831]]\nIn common with the UK textile industry, Nottingham's textile sector fell into decline in the decades following World War II. {{Citation needed|date=December 2014}}  Little textile manufacture now takes place in Nottingham; however, many of the former industrial buildings in the Lace Market district have been restored and put to new uses.\n\nNottingham was one of the boroughs reformed by the [[Municipal Corporations Act 1835]], and at that time consisted of the parishes of St Mary, St Nicholas and St Peter. It was expanded in 1877 by adding the parishes of [[Basford, Nottingham|Basford]], Brewhouse Yard, [[Bulwell]], [[Radford, Nottingham|Radford]], [[Sneinton]], Standard Hill, and parts of the parishes of [[West Bridgford]], [[Carlton, Nottinghamshire|Carlton]], [[Wilford, Nottinghamshire|Wilford]] (North Wilford). In 1889 Nottingham became a [[county borough]] under the [[Local Government Act 1888]]. City status was awarded as part of the Diamond Jubilee celebrations of Queen Victoria, being signified in a letter from the prime minister, the [[Robert Cecil, 3rd Marquess of Salisbury|Marquess of Salisbury]] to the mayor, dated 18 June 1897. Nottingham was extended in 1933 by adding [[Bilborough]] and [[Wollaton]], parts of the parishes of Bestwood Park and [[Colwick]], and a recently developed part of the [[Beeston Urban District]]. A further boundary extension was granted in 1951 when Clifton and Wilford (south of the River Trent) were incorporated into the city.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.visionofbritain.org.uk/relationships.jsp?u_id=10001389&c_id=10001043 |title=Relationships / unit history of Nottingham |accessdate=22 March 2007 |publisher=A Vision of Britain Through Time |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070930235913/http://www.visionofbritain.org.uk/relationships.jsp?u_id=10001389&c_id=10001043 |archivedate=30 September 2007  }}</ref><ref name=localhist>{{cite web |url=http://www.localhistories.org/nottingham.html |title=A Brief History of Nottingham, England |author=Tim Lambert |accessdate=12 July 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120622224124/http://www.localhistories.org/nottingham.html |archive-date=22 June 2012 |url-status=live }}</ref>\n\n{{historical populations\n|title = Demographic evolution of Nottingham\n|cols = 2 | align = center|percentages=off\n|4th century|&lt;37\n|10th century|&lt;1,000\n|11th century|1,500\n|14th century|3,000\n|Early 17th century|4,000\n|Late 17th century|5,000\n}}\n{{historical populations\n|title = <nowiki />\n|cols = 3 | align = center\n|1801|29,000\n|1811|34,000\n|1821|40,000\n|1831|51,000\n|1841|53,000\n|1851|58,000\n|1861|76,000\n|1871|87,000\n|1881|159,000\n|1901|240,000\n|1911|260,000\n|1921|269,000\n|1931|265,000\n|1951|306,000\n|1961|312,000\n|1971|301,000\n|1981|278,000\n|1991|273,000\n|2001|275,000\n}}\nElectric trams were introduced to the city in 1901; they served the city for 35 years until 1936.

South of the river there has also been expansion with new areas such as Edwalton and West Bridgford, adding to Nottingham's [[urban sprawl]]. Although this growth slowed towards the end of the century, the modern pressures for more affordable and council housing is back on the political agenda and there is now pressure on the [[green belt]] which surrounds the city.{{citation needed|date=October 2013}}\n\n==Government==\n\n===Local government===\n[[File:Council-House-Nottingham.jpg|thumb|right|[[Nottingham Council House]]]]\n\nThere are two major local authorities that serve the Nottingham area. These are [[Nottingham City Council]] and [[Nottinghamshire County Council]].\n\n[[Nottingham City Council]] is a [[unitary authority]] based at [[Loxley House, Nottingham]] on Station Street. It consists of 55 [[councillors]], representing 20 [[Ward (politics)|wards]], who are elected every four years; the last elections being held on [[2015 Nottingham City Council election|7 May 2015]].\n\nThe city also has a [[Lord Mayor of Nottingham|Lord Mayor]] who is selected by city councillors from among themselves. The position is largely ceremonial but the Lord Mayor also acts as Chair of Full Council meetings.\n\nThe City of Nottingham's boundaries are tightly drawn and exclude several suburbs and satellite towns that are usually considered part of [[Greater Nottingham]]. Unlike the City, these areas are governed by a two tier system of local government. [[Nottinghamshire County Council]] (based at [[County Hall, Nottinghamshire|County Hall]]), provides the upper tier of local government whilst the lower tier is split into several district or borough councils. The County Council are responsible for Health, Social Care, Education, Highways, Transport, Libraries and Trading Standards, whilst the lower tier councils are responsible for local planning, neighbourhood services, housing, licensing, environmental health and leisure facilities. The western suburbs of [[Beeston, Nottinghamshire|Beeston]], [[Stapleford, Nottinghamshire|Stapleford]] and [[Eastwood, Nottinghamshire|Eastwood]] are administered by [[Broxtowe Borough Council]]. Further west still, the Nottingham urban district extends into [[Derbyshire]] where [[Ilkeston]] and [[Long Eaton]] are administered by [[Erewash Borough Council]], and [[Ripley, Derbyshire|Ripley]] by [[Amber Valley]].

Completely encircling the city, it extends for several miles into the surrounding districts, as well as towards Derby.\n\n==Architecture==\nThe geographical centre of Nottingham is usually defined as the [[Old Market Square]].{{Citation needed|date=February 2016}} The square is dominated by the [[Nottingham Council House|Council House]], which replaced the Nottingham Exchange Building, built in 1726. The Council House was built in the 1920s to display civic pride, ostentatiously using [[baroque]] columns and placing stone statues of two lions at the front to stand watch over the square. The [[Exchange Arcade]], on the ground floor, is an upmarket shopping centre containing boutiques.\n\n[[File:Byron house 2.JPG|thumb|Nottingham Trent University, Arkwright Building]]\n\nTall office buildings line Maid Marian Way. The Georgian area around Oxford and Regent Streets is dominated by small professional firms. The [[Albert Hall, Nottingham|Albert Hall]] faces the [[gothic revival architecture|Gothic revival]] [[Nottingham Cathedral|St Barnabas' Roman Catholic Cathedral]] by [[Augustus Welby Northmore Pugin|Pugin]]. [[Nottingham Castle]] and its grounds are located further south in the western third of the city. The central third descends from the University district in the north, past [[Nottingham Trent University]]'s Gothic revival Arkwright Building. The university also owns many other buildings in this area. The Theatre Royal on Theatre Square, with its pillared fa\u00e7ade, was built in 1865. King and Queen Streets are home to striking [[Victorian architecture|Victorian]] buildings designed by such architects as [[Alfred Waterhouse]] and [[Watson Fothergill]].{{citation needed|date=November 2013}}\n\nTo the south, is [[Broadmarsh Shopping Centre]]. The Canal-side further south of this is adjacent to [[Nottingham railway station]] and home to numerous redeveloped 19th-century industrial buildings, reused as bars and restaurants.{{citation needed|date=November 2013}}\n\nThe eastern third of the city centre contains the Victoria Shopping Centre, built in the 1970s on the site of the demolished Victoria Railway Station. All that remains of the old station is the clock tower and the station hotel, now the Nottingham Hilton Hotel. The 250-foot-high Victoria Centre flats stand above the shopping centre and are the tallest buildings in the city. The eastern third contains [[Hockley Village]]. Hockley is where many of Nottingham's unique, independent shops are to be found. It is also home to two alternative cinemas.\n\n===Lace Market===\n[[File:Lace market justice galleries.JPG|thumb|National Justice Museum in the Lace Market]]\n\nThe [[Lace Market]] area just south of [[Hockley, Nottingham|Hockley]] has streets with four- to seven-storey red brick warehouses, [[iron railing]]s and [[Red telephone box|red phone boxes]].\n\nMany of the buildings have been converted into apartments, bars and restaurants. The largest building in the Lace Market is the [[The Adams Building Nottingham|Adams Building]], built by [[Thomas Chambers Hine]] for [[Thomas Adams (manufacturer and philanthropist)|Thomas Adams]] (1807\u20131873), and currently used by [[Nottingham College]]. The Georgian-built Shire Hall, which was once Nottingham's main [[courtroom|court]] and [[prison]] building, is now home to the [[National Justice Museum]] (formerly the \"Galleries of Justice\").\n\n===Public houses===\n''[[Ye Olde Trip To Jerusalem]]'' (the ''Trip''), partially built into the cave system beneath Nottingham Castle, is a contender for the title of England's Oldest Pub, as it is supposed to have been established in 1189.<ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/nottingham/entertainment/pubs/trip.shtml| title=Nottingham \u2013 Pubs| accessdate=4 December 2014| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140621045656/http://www.bbc.co.uk/nottingham/entertainment/pubs/trip.shtml| archive-date=21 June 2014| url-status=live}}</ref> ''[[The Bell Inn, Nottingham|The Bell Inn]]'' in the Old Market Square, and ''[[Ye Olde Salutation Inn]]'' (the ''Salutation'') in Maid Marian Way have both disputed this claim.

Nottingham, however, does not have one, having only been designated a city in 1897, in celebration of Queen Victoria's Diamond Jubilee. From around AD 1100 Nottingham was part of the [[Diocese of Lichfield]], controlled as an [[List of Archdeacons of Nottingham|archdeaconry]] from [[Lichfield Cathedral]] in Staffordshire. However, in 1837 the archdeaconry was placed under the control of the [[Diocese of Lincoln]]. In 1884 it became part of the newly created [[Diocese of Southwell and Nottingham|Diocese of Southwell]], which it, and the city, are still part of today. The bishop is based at [[Southwell Minster]], {{convert|14|mi|0}} north-east of the city.\n\nDespite not having a cathedral, Nottingham has three notable historic [[Anglican parish church]]es, all of which date back to the [[Middle Ages]]. [[St. Mary's Church, Nottingham|St. Mary the Virgin]], in the Lace Market, is the oldest and largest. The church dates from the eighth or ninth centuries, but the present building is at least the third on the site, dating primarily from 1377 to 1485. St. Mary's is considered the mother church of the city and civic services are held here, including the welcome to the new [[Lord Mayor of Nottingham]] each year. It is a member of the [[Greater Churches Group]]. [[St. Peter's Church, Nottingham|St. Peter's]] in the heart of the city is the oldest building in continuous use in Nottingham, with traces of building starting in 1180. [[St. Nicholas' Church, Nottingham|St. Nicholas']] is the third.\n\nA variety of chapels and meeting rooms are in the town. Many of these grand buildings have been demolished, including [[Halifax Place Wesleyan Chapel]], but some have been re-used, notably [[High Pavement Chapel]] which is now a public house. There are three [[Christadelphian]] meeting halls in the city and the national headquarters of the [[Congregational Federation]] is in Nottingham.\n\nNottingham is one of 18 British cities that do not have an Anglican cathedral.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://lovemytown.co.uk/citystatus/index.htm |title=City Status |publisher=Lovemytown.co.uk |accessdate=22 February 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140620043638/http://lovemytown.co.uk/CityStatus/index.htm |archive-date=20 June 2014 |url-status=live }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://lovemytown.co.uk/Cathedrals/CathedralsTable3.asp |title=Cathedrals |publisher=Lovemytown.co.uk |accessdate=22 February 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140116110835/http://www.lovemytown.co.uk/Cathedrals/CathedralsTable3.asp |archive-date=16 January 2014 |url-status=live }}</ref> It is, however, home to the [[Nottingham Cathedral|Roman Catholic Cathedral of St. Barnabas]], which was designed by [[Augustus Pugin]] and [[consecration|consecrated]] in 1844.

The first film, ''[[Harold & Kumar Go to White Castle]]'', was released on July 30, 2004, by [[New Line Cinema]] and spawned a [[sequel]] titled ''[[Harold & Kumar Escape from Guantanamo Bay]]'', released four years later. ''[[A Very Harold & Kumar 3D Christmas]]'', the third installment of the series, opened nationwide in the U.S. on November 4, 2011.\n\nThe three films, produced on a total budget of [[United States dollar|US$]]40 million, grossed $116 million worldwide. In addition to their box office grosses, the films were successful on home video. The series has been released on both [[Blu-ray Disc|Blu-ray]] and [[DVD]].\n\n==Films==\n\n===''Harold & Kumar Go to White Castle'' (2004)===\n{{main|Harold & Kumar Go to White Castle}}\nHarold Lee and Kumar Patel are two Asian-American ([[Korean-American|Korean]] and [[Indian-American|Indian]]) [[stoner (drug user)|stoner]]s who get the munchies and embark on a quest throughout [[New Jersey]] for [[White Castle (restaurant)|White Castle]] burgers after seeing them advertised on TV.

The pair run into Vanessa, Kumar's ex-girlfriend, and her fianc\u00e9 Colton, another old college buddy who helped Harold with getting a job at Brewster-Keagan, at the airport. During the plane flight, an elderly woman sees Kumar lighting a hand-crafted smokeless bong, who thinks that it is a bomb, and screams \"Terrorist!\". After a confusion of the words \"bong\" and \"bomb\", two undercover air marshals tackle Kumar, who accidentally drops the bong on the floor, breaking it and releasing what another passenger thinks is \"Poison gas!\". Harold and Kumar are detained by Ron Fox, a racist [[Deputy Secretary of Homeland Security]], in Washington, D.C., who then sends them to the [[Guantanamo Bay detention camp]]. But just as they are about to eat a \"cockmeat sandwich\", the neighboring prisoners assault the guards and they are able to escape back to the United States. They meet with their college friend, Raza, who arranges a car for them to travel to Texas in search of Colton, a member of a family who has connections with political officials. On the way to Texas, they encounter various people from an inbred trailer home family to the Ku Klux Klan to [[#Neil Patrick Harris|Neil Patrick Harris]].\n\n===''A Very Harold & Kumar 3D Christmas'' (2011)===\n{{main|A Very Harold & Kumar 3D Christmas}}\nIn April 2009, Kal Penn accepted the position of Associate Director of the [[White House Office of Public Liaison]] in the [[Obama administration]]; when asked if his new job would mean no more ''Harold and Kumar'' films, he said, \"That's probably true for now.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=https://tv.yahoo.com/blog/house-the-truth-behind-the-shocking-surprise--229?nc|title='House': The Truth Behind the Shocking Surprise|publisher=[[Television Without Pity]], [[Yahoo!

Seven years after the events of ''Harold & Kumar Go to White Castle'' and ''Harold & Kumar Escape from Guantanamo Bay'', Harold and Kumar embark on an adventure to find a new Christmas tree after Harold destroys the original while trying to dispose of Kumar's joint.\n\n===Future===\nIn July, 2016, co-star John Cho revealed that he had pitched an idea for a fourth ''Harold & Kumar'', and felt there was a chance it might get made.  In an interview with ''Den of Geek!'', Cho Stated: \"But I thought of a really great idea, and I pitched it out to the director when we happened to be having dinner one night.

The character was created by [[Jon Hurwitz]] and [[Hayden Schlossberg]] and is based upon their real-life friend, named Harold Lee.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.npr.org/programs/fresh-air/2017/08/17/544045071/fresh-air-for-august-17-2017|title=In 'Columbus,' John Cho Reckons With His Own First-Generation Culture Clash (citation at 9 minutes, 30 seconds)|last=Jed|first=Simon|date=August 17, 2017|website=NPR Fresh Air|accessdate=}}</ref>  The character is portrayed by [[John Cho]] in all three films.\n\nIn ''[[Harold & Kumar Go to White Castle]]'', Harold is a hard-working man from the northern part of [[New Jersey]]. His lazy best friend and roommate is Kumar Patel. At times, Harold lets go of his obligations, but only during moments of extreme coercion, to the point where he amazes his laid-back friend Kumar. Harold is the yin to Kumar's yang, with the both of them being united through their enjoyment of cannabis smoking after a long day's work and or leisurely fun (such as aboard an airplane in the sequel, and an after work \"Friday night special\" in the first film).\n\nHarold's romantic life centers around [[John Hughes (filmmaker)|John Hughes]]-like fancies (as is evidenced by his obsession with film classics such as ''[[Sixteen Candles]]''). Harold thinks that he'll wind up with a similarly repressed Korean-American young woman\u2014Cindy Kim\u2014who isn't as repressed as he thinks. The true object of Harold's desire, however, is Maria Perez (played by [[Paula Garces]]), who lives down the hall from him in his building.\n\nIn ''[[Harold & Kumar Escape from Guantanamo Bay]]'', when embarking on their trip to Amsterdam they are arrested on the flight there after Kumar tests out his \"smokeless bong\" in the airplane lavatory. Then the two are sent to Guantanamo Bay where they are involved in a series of comedic events. In one of Kumar's flashbacks, it is revealed that Harold used to be an [[emo]] and Kumar was a hard working mathematically proficient nerd in college.\n\nIn ''[[A Very Harold & Kumar 3D Christmas]]'', Harold is married to Maria and hasn't spoken to Kumar in years. The two are reunited and rekindle their friendship after Kumar brings over a package for Harold that arrived at their old apartment. Inside the package is a marijuana joint, which winds up burning down Harold's father in law's Christmas tree; after an eventful night of looking for a replacement tree, it is revealed that the package was a gift from [[Santa Claus]], who wanted the two to become friends again.\n\n===Kumar Patel===\n[[File:Kal Penn.jpg|thumb|left|Kumar Patel played by [[Kal Penn]]]]\nKumar Patel is an [[Indian American]] student residing in [[New Jersey]]. His family includes his father and his brother, Saikat Patel. The character was created by [[Jon Hurwitz]] and [[Hayden Schlossberg]], and is portrayed by [[Kal Penn]] in all three films.\n\nIn ''[[Harold & Kumar Go to White Castle]]'', Kumar Patel is a 22-year-old college graduate. He shares an apartment with his best friend, Harold Lee. Unlike Harold, Kumar is a fearless, confident [[slacker]] who is capable of doing what he wants. Both his father and brother are successful doctors and expect him to follow in their footsteps. Though not interested in school, Kumar is remarkably intelligent and knows how to perform complex surgical procedures, as shown in the film while looking for [[Medical marijuana|medicinal marijuana]] at the hospital.\n\nIn ''[[Harold & Kumar Escape from Guantanamo Bay]]'', it is revealed that he had a girlfriend Vanessa in college, who introduced him to marijuana and transformed him from an aloof geek into the easy-going stoner he is today. She is about to marry the shifty, arrogant frat boy Colton Graham (who disapproves of her marijuana habit), but Kumar interrupts the wedding and wins her back by reciting \"Square Root of 3,\" a math themed love poem that he was afraid to show her in college. Harold, Kumar and Vanessa then go to Amsterdam to find Maria, Harold's love interest.\n\nIn ''[[A Very Harold & Kumar 3D Christmas]]'', Kumar hasn't spoken to Harold in years. The two are reunited and rekindle their friendship after Kumar brings over a package for Harold that arrived at their old apartment. Inside the package is a marijuana joint, which winds up burning down Harold's Christmas tree; after an eventful night of looking for a replacement tree, it is revealed that the package was a gift from [[Santa Claus]], who wanted the two to become friends again.\nVanessa tells Kumar she is pregnant shortly after their breakup, but believes that Kumar is not mature enough to raise their child. After his adventure, Kumar tells Vanessa he has matured and very much wants to raise the baby with her, even offering to return to medical school and give up marijuana. Vanessa decides to give him another chance, also telling him he shouldn't give up his favorite recreational activity.\n\n===Neil Patrick Harris===\n[[File:Neil Patrick Harris 2011 (cropped).jpg|thumb|left| [[Neil Patrick Harris]] playing a fictionalized version of himself]]\nAll three films feature [[Neil Patrick Harris]] playing a fictionalized version of himself. In the films, Harris is portrayed as a heavy drug user and [[womanizing|womanizer]], despite being openly gay in real life. Harris didn't publicly come out until 2006, two years after ''White Castle'' was released. Although ''Guantanamo Bay'' was released two years after Harris came out, his fictional self was still characterized as a womanizer until the third film, when it's revealed that Harris is only pretending to be gay just to have sex with women. His real-life partner, [[David Burtka]], appears as a fictionalized version of himself, who is Harris' drug dealer posing as the latter's life partner.\n\nIn a 2008 interview with [[Ain't It Cool News]], Neil Patrick Harris revealed that the series' writers were discussing the possibility of a spin-off movie based on his fictional persona.<ref>Ain't It Cool News: Quint chats with Kal Penn, John Cho and Neil Patrick Harris! Possible NPH spin-off movie?!? And a tidbit on STAR TREK![https://www.aintitcool.com/node/36008]</ref>\n\n===Rosenberg and Goldstein===\nAndy Rosenberg and Seth Goldstein are two [[Jewish]] friends and counterparts of Harold and Kumar portrayed by [[Eddie Kaye Thomas]] and [[David Krumholtz]]. They live in the same apartment building as Harold and Kumar. They declined to go to White Castle with Harold and Kumar as they chose Hot Dog Heaven instead, but in the third movie did go to White Castle. In the third movie, Goldstein has a son named Christian and stated he had converted to Christianity after marrying his wife, and even wished to [[Foreskin restoration|uncircumcise himself]], which all aggravated Rosenberg who still practices Judaism.\n\n==Reception==\n\n===Box office performance===\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"width:99%;\"\n|-\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Film\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Release date\n! colspan=\"3\" | Box office revenue\n! colspan=\"2\" text=\"wrap\"| Domestic box office ranking\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Budget\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Reference\n|-\n!

The first film, ''[[Harold & Kumar Go to White Castle]]'', was released on July 30, 2004, by [[New Line Cinema]] and spawned a [[sequel]] titled ''[[Harold & Kumar Escape from Guantanamo Bay]]'', released four years later. ''[[A Very Harold & Kumar 3D Christmas]]'', the third installment of the series, opened nationwide in the U.S. on November 4, 2011.\n\nThe three films, produced on a total budget of [[United States dollar|US$]]40 million, grossed $116 million worldwide. In addition to their box office grosses, the films were successful on home video. The series has been released on both [[Blu-ray Disc|Blu-ray]] and [[DVD]].\n\n==Films==\n\n===''Harold & Kumar Go to White Castle'' (2004)===\n{{main|Harold & Kumar Go to White Castle}}\nHarold Lee and Kumar Patel are two Asian-American ([[Korean-American|Korean]] and [[Indian-American|Indian]]) [[stoner (drug user)|stoner]]s who get the munchies and embark on a quest throughout [[New Jersey]] for [[White Castle (restaurant)|White Castle]] burgers after seeing them advertised on TV. On their way they encounter many obstacles, including a gang of extreme sports punks, a raccoon with an attitude, a group of Asian nerds, a racist police department, a cheetah that has escaped from a zoo, and an out-of-control [[#Neil Patrick Harris|Neil Patrick Harris]].\n\n===''Harold & Kumar Escape from Guantanamo Bay'' (2008)===\n{{main|Harold & Kumar Escape from Guantanamo Bay}}\nImmediately following the events of ''Harold & Kumar Go to White Castle'', Harold Lee and Kumar Patel fly to Amsterdam so Harold can pursue a budding romance with his vacationing neighbor. The pair run into Vanessa, Kumar's ex-girlfriend, and her fianc\u00e9 Colton, another old college buddy who helped Harold with getting a job at Brewster-Keagan, at the airport. During the plane flight, an elderly woman sees Kumar lighting a hand-crafted smokeless bong, who thinks that it is a bomb, and screams \"Terrorist!\". After a confusion of the words \"bong\" and \"bomb\", two undercover air marshals tackle Kumar, who accidentally drops the bong on the floor, breaking it and releasing what another passenger thinks is \"Poison gas!\". Harold and Kumar are detained by Ron Fox, a racist [[Deputy Secretary of Homeland Security]], in Washington, D.C., who then sends them to the [[Guantanamo Bay detention camp]]. But just as they are about to eat a \"cockmeat sandwich\", the neighboring prisoners assault the guards and they are able to escape back to the United States. They meet with their college friend, Raza, who arranges a car for them to travel to Texas in search of Colton, a member of a family who has connections with political officials. On the way to Texas, they encounter various people from an inbred trailer home family to the Ku Klux Klan to [[#Neil Patrick Harris|Neil Patrick Harris]].\n\n===''A Very Harold & Kumar 3D Christmas'' (2011)===\n{{main|A Very Harold & Kumar 3D Christmas}}\nIn April 2009, Kal Penn accepted the position of Associate Director of the [[White House Office of Public Liaison]] in the [[Obama administration]]; when asked if his new job would mean no more ''Harold and Kumar'' films, he said, \"That's probably true for now.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=https://tv.yahoo.com/blog/house-the-truth-behind-the-shocking-surprise--229?nc|title='House': The Truth Behind the Shocking Surprise|publisher=[[Television Without Pity]], [[Yahoo!

Seven years after the events of ''Harold & Kumar Go to White Castle'' and ''Harold & Kumar Escape from Guantanamo Bay'', Harold and Kumar embark on an adventure to find a new Christmas tree after Harold destroys the original while trying to dispose of Kumar's joint.\n\n===Future===\nIn July, 2016, co-star John Cho revealed that he had pitched an idea for a fourth ''Harold & Kumar'', and felt there was a chance it might get made.  In an interview with ''Den of Geek!'', Cho Stated: \"But I thought of a really great idea, and I pitched it out to the director when we happened to be having dinner one night. And I don't know...I think we're gonna get this made.\u201d<ref>https://www.denofgeek.com/us/movies/harold-kumar/256931/john-cho-on-harold-kumar-4-i-think-we-re-gonna-get-this-made</ref>\n\n==Characters==\n\n===Harold Lee===\n[[File:John Cho 2008.jpg|thumb|left|Harold Lee played by [[John Cho]]]]\nHarold Lee is a [[Korean American]] [[investment banking|investment banker]] who resides in [[New Jersey]]. The character was created by [[Jon Hurwitz]] and [[Hayden Schlossberg]] and is based upon their real-life friend, named Harold Lee.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.npr.org/programs/fresh-air/2017/08/17/544045071/fresh-air-for-august-17-2017|title=In 'Columbus,' John Cho Reckons With His Own First-Generation Culture Clash (citation at 9 minutes, 30 seconds)|last=Jed|first=Simon|date=August 17, 2017|website=NPR Fresh Air|accessdate=}}</ref>  The character is portrayed by [[John Cho]] in all three films.\n\nIn ''[[Harold & Kumar Go to White Castle]]'', Harold is a hard-working man from the northern part of [[New Jersey]]. His lazy best friend and roommate is Kumar Patel. At times, Harold lets go of his obligations, but only during moments of extreme coercion, to the point where he amazes his laid-back friend Kumar. Harold is the yin to Kumar's yang, with the both of them being united through their enjoyment of cannabis smoking after a long day's work and or leisurely fun (such as aboard an airplane in the sequel, and an after work \"Friday night special\" in the first film).\n\nHarold's romantic life centers around [[John Hughes (filmmaker)|John Hughes]]-like fancies (as is evidenced by his obsession with film classics such as ''[[Sixteen Candles]]''). Harold thinks that he'll wind up with a similarly repressed Korean-American young woman\u2014Cindy Kim\u2014who isn't as repressed as he thinks. The true object of Harold's desire, however, is Maria Perez (played by [[Paula Garces]]), who lives down the hall from him in his building.\n\nIn ''[[Harold & Kumar Escape from Guantanamo Bay]]'', when embarking on their trip to Amsterdam they are arrested on the flight there after Kumar tests out his \"smokeless bong\" in the airplane lavatory. Then the two are sent to Guantanamo Bay where they are involved in a series of comedic events. In one of Kumar's flashbacks, it is revealed that Harold used to be an [[emo]] and Kumar was a hard working mathematically proficient nerd in college.\n\nIn ''[[A Very Harold & Kumar 3D Christmas]]'', Harold is married to Maria and hasn't spoken to Kumar in years. The two are reunited and rekindle their friendship after Kumar brings over a package for Harold that arrived at their old apartment. Inside the package is a marijuana joint, which winds up burning down Harold's father in law's Christmas tree; after an eventful night of looking for a replacement tree, it is revealed that the package was a gift from [[Santa Claus]], who wanted the two to become friends again.\n\n===Kumar Patel===\n[[File:Kal Penn.jpg|thumb|left|Kumar Patel played by [[Kal Penn]]]]\nKumar Patel is an [[Indian American]] student residing in [[New Jersey]]. His family includes his father and his brother, Saikat Patel. The character was created by [[Jon Hurwitz]] and [[Hayden Schlossberg]], and is portrayed by [[Kal Penn]] in all three films.\n\nIn ''[[Harold & Kumar Go to White Castle]]'', Kumar Patel is a 22-year-old college graduate. He shares an apartment with his best friend, Harold Lee. Unlike Harold, Kumar is a fearless, confident [[slacker]] who is capable of doing what he wants. Both his father and brother are successful doctors and expect him to follow in their footsteps. Though not interested in school, Kumar is remarkably intelligent and knows how to perform complex surgical procedures, as shown in the film while looking for [[Medical marijuana|medicinal marijuana]] at the hospital.\n\nIn ''[[Harold & Kumar Escape from Guantanamo Bay]]'', it is revealed that he had a girlfriend Vanessa in college, who introduced him to marijuana and transformed him from an aloof geek into the easy-going stoner he is today. She is about to marry the shifty, arrogant frat boy Colton Graham (who disapproves of her marijuana habit), but Kumar interrupts the wedding and wins her back by reciting \"Square Root of 3,\" a math themed love poem that he was afraid to show her in college. Harold, Kumar and Vanessa then go to Amsterdam to find Maria, Harold's love interest.\n\nIn ''[[A Very Harold & Kumar 3D Christmas]]'', Kumar hasn't spoken to Harold in years. The two are reunited and rekindle their friendship after Kumar brings over a package for Harold that arrived at their old apartment. Inside the package is a marijuana joint, which winds up burning down Harold's Christmas tree; after an eventful night of looking for a replacement tree, it is revealed that the package was a gift from [[Santa Claus]], who wanted the two to become friends again.\nVanessa tells Kumar she is pregnant shortly after their breakup, but believes that Kumar is not mature enough to raise their child. After his adventure, Kumar tells Vanessa he has matured and very much wants to raise the baby with her, even offering to return to medical school and give up marijuana. Vanessa decides to give him another chance, also telling him he shouldn't give up his favorite recreational activity.\n\n===Neil Patrick Harris===\n[[File:Neil Patrick Harris 2011 (cropped).jpg|thumb|left| [[Neil Patrick Harris]] playing a fictionalized version of himself]]\nAll three films feature [[Neil Patrick Harris]] playing a fictionalized version of himself. In the films, Harris is portrayed as a heavy drug user and [[womanizing|womanizer]], despite being openly gay in real life. Harris didn't publicly come out until 2006, two years after ''White Castle'' was released. Although ''Guantanamo Bay'' was released two years after Harris came out, his fictional self was still characterized as a womanizer until the third film, when it's revealed that Harris is only pretending to be gay just to have sex with women. His real-life partner, [[David Burtka]], appears as a fictionalized version of himself, who is Harris' drug dealer posing as the latter's life partner.\n\nIn a 2008 interview with [[Ain't It Cool News]], Neil Patrick Harris revealed that the series' writers were discussing the possibility of a spin-off movie based on his fictional persona.<ref>Ain't It Cool News: Quint chats with Kal Penn, John Cho and Neil Patrick Harris! Possible NPH spin-off movie?!? And a tidbit on STAR TREK![https://www.aintitcool.com/node/36008]</ref>\n\n===Rosenberg and Goldstein===\nAndy Rosenberg and Seth Goldstein are two [[Jewish]] friends and counterparts of Harold and Kumar portrayed by [[Eddie Kaye Thomas]] and [[David Krumholtz]]. They live in the same apartment building as Harold and Kumar. They declined to go to White Castle with Harold and Kumar as they chose Hot Dog Heaven instead, but in the third movie did go to White Castle. In the third movie, Goldstein has a son named Christian and stated he had converted to Christianity after marrying his wife, and even wished to [[Foreskin restoration|uncircumcise himself]], which all aggravated Rosenberg who still practices Judaism.\n\n==Reception==\n\n===Box office performance===\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"width:99%;\"\n|-\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Film\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Release date\n! colspan=\"3\" | Box office revenue\n! colspan=\"2\" text=\"wrap\"| Domestic box office ranking\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Budget\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Reference\n|-\n!
