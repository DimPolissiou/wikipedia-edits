His ancestors were ''Crist\u00e3os-novos'', or [[New Christians]], [[Religious conversion|converted]] from [[Judaism]] to [[Roman Catholicism|Catholicism]] [[Persecution of Jews and Muslims by Manuel I of Portugal|by state edict]] at 1497.<ref>Salomon & Sassoon, introduction to da Costa's Examination of Pharisaic Traditions, 1993 [p. 2].</ref> His father was a well-off international merchant and [[tax-farmer]].<ref>Salomon & Sassoon, introduction to da Costa's Examination of Pharisaic Traditions, 1993 [p. 4].</ref>\n\nStudying [[Canon law of the Catholic Church|canon law]] in the [[University of Coimbra]] intermittently between 1600 and 1608, he began to read the [[Bible]] and contemplate it seriously. Costa also occupied an ecclesiastical office. In his autobiography Costa pictured his family as devout Catholics. However they had been subjects to several investigations by the [[Portuguese Inquisition|Inquisition]], suggesting they were [[Marrano|Conversos]], more or less close to Jewish customs. Gabriel explicitly supported the adherence to [[Mosaic authorship|Mosaic]] prescriptions as well as traditional ones.<ref>{{Cite book|url=|title=In the shadow of history : Jews and conversos at the dawn of modernity|last=Faur|first=Jos\u00e9|date=1992|publisher=State University of New York Press|year=|isbn=9780791408018|location=|pages=esp. 123|oclc=878665784}}</ref>\n\nAfter his father died, the family came into greater financial difficulties due to some debts that had not been paid. In 1614 they changed this predicament as they sneaked out of Portugal with a significant sum of money they previously collected as tax-farmers for [[:pt:Jorge de Mascarenhas|Jorge de Mascarenhas]]. The family took Jewish names, and headed to two major [[Sephardi Jews|Sephardic]] [[diaspora]] communities. Newly circumcised, two brothers settled in [[Amsterdam]], and two with their mother in [[Hamburg]]. Gabriel was in the latter city, and became '''Uriel''' for the Jewish neighbors, and '''Adam Romez''' for outside relations, presumably because he was wanted in Portugal. All resumed their international trade business.<ref>Salomon & Sassoon, introduction to da Costa's Examination of Pharisaic Traditions, 1993 [p. 6-8].</ref> \n\nUpon arriving there, Costa quickly became disenchanted with the kind of Judaism he saw in practice. He came to believe that the [[rabbi]]nic leadership was too consumed by [[ritual]]ism and [[Halakha|legalistic]] posturing. His earliest known written message is known as ''Propostas contra a Tradi\u00e7\u00e3o'' (Propositions against the Tradition).<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://archive.org/details/dieschriftendesu00acos|title=Die Schriften des Uriel da Costa|last=Acosta|first=Uriel|last2=Gebhardt|first2=Carl|date=1922-01-01|publisher=Amsterdam, M. Hertzberger|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=1\u201310}}</ref> In eleven short theses he called into question the disparity between certain Jewish customs and a literal reading of the [[Law of Moses]], and more generally tried to prove from reason and scripture that this system of law is sufficient. In 1616 the text was dispatched to the leaders of the prominent [[History of the Jews in Venice |Jewish community in Venice]]. The Venetians ruled against it and prompted the [[Portuguese Jewish community in Hamburg|Hamburg community]] to sanction Costa with a [[Herem (censure)|''herem'', or excommunication]]. The ''Objections'' are extant only as quotes and paraphrases in ''Magen \u1e7fe-tsinah (\u05de\u05d2\u05df \u05d5\u05e6\u05e0\u05d4''; \"Shield and Buckler\"), a longer rebuttal by [[Leon of Modena]], of the Venice community,<ref>Salomon & Sassoon, introduction to da Costa's Examination of Pharisaic Traditions, 1993 [p. 9-12].</ref> who responded to religious queries about Costa sent by the Hamburg Jewish authorities.<ref>Leone of Modena later published a developed iconoclastic treatise of his own (\"kol sakhal / shaagat arye\"), and it is quite possible that da\nCosta's doubts had some influence on him.

Three chapters of the unpublished manuscript were stolen, and formed the target for a traditionalist rebuttal quickly published by Semuel da Silva of Hamburg; so Costa enlarged his book and the printed version already contains responses and revisions to the crux of the tract.\n\nIn 1623 Costa published the Portuguese book ''Exame das tradi\u00e7\u00f5es phariseas'' (Examination of Pharisaic Traditions).<ref>The complete printed book was discovered in 1990 at the [[Royal Library, Denmark|Danish Royal Library]] by H P Salomon; previously only the three chapters had been known.</ref> Costa's second work spans more than 200 pages. In the first part it develops his earlier ''Propositons'', taking into account Modena's responses and corrections. In the second part he adds his newer views that the [[Hebrew Bible]], especially the Torah, does not support the idea of [[immortality of the soul]]. Costa believed that this was not an idea deeply rooted in biblical Judaism, but rather had been formulated primarily by later [[Pharisees|Pharisaic]] rabbis, and promoted to a [[Jewish principles of faith]]. The work further pointed out the discrepancies between biblical Judaism and [[Rabbinic Judaism]]; he declared the latter to be an accumulation of mechanical [[ceremony|ceremonies]] and practices. In his view, it was thoroughly devoid of [[spirituality|spiritual]] and philosophical concepts. Costa was relatively early in teaching to Jewish readership in favor of the mortality of the soul, and in appealing exclusively to direct reading of the bible. He cites neither rabbinic authorities nor philosophers of the Aristotelian and Neoplatonic traditions.<ref>Salomon & Sassoon, introduction to da Costa's Examination of Pharisaic Traditions, 1993 [p. 47].</ref>\n\nThe book became very controversial among [[Jews in Amsterdam|the local Jewish community]], whose leaders reported to the city authorities this was an attack on Christianity as well as on Judaism, and it was [[book burning|burned publicly]]. He was fined a significant sum. In 1627 Costa was a denizen of Utrecht. The Amsterdam community still had an uncomfortable relationship with him; they queried a Venetian rabbi, Yaakov Ha-Levi, whether his elderly mother is eligible for a burial lot in their city; the next year the mother died and Uriel went back to Amsterdam. Ultimately, the loneliness was too much for him to handle,<ref>Salomon & Sassoon, introduction to da Costa's Examination of Pharisaic Traditions, 1993 [p. 18-24].</ref> Around 1633 he accepted the terms of reconciliation, which he does not detail in his autobiography, and was reaccepted into the community.\n\nShortly after that Costa was tried again; he encountered two Christians who expressed to him their desire to convert to Judaism. In accordance with his views, he dissuaded them from doing so. Based on this and earlier accusations regarding [[kashrut]]'','' he was [[Herem (censure)|excommunicated]]. As he describes it, for seven years he lived in virtual isolation, shunned by his family and embroiled in civil-financial disputes with them. In search for legal help, he decided to go back being \"an ape amongst the apes\"; he would follow the traditions and practices, but with little real conviction. He sought a way of reconciliation. As a punishment for his heretical views, Costa was publicly given 39 [[Flagellation|lashes]] at the Portuguese [[synagogue]] in Amsterdam. He was then forced to lie on the floor while the congregation trampled over him. This left him both demoralized and seeking revenge against the man (a cousin or nephew) who brought about his trial, seven years previously.[[File:Uriel Da Costa Pharisees.JPG|thumb|250px|right|English translation of Da Costa's ''Examination of Pharisaic Traditions'']]The humiliating ceremony makes the final dramatic point of his autobiography. This document is a few pages long, and was transmitted to print in Latin some decades after his death, with the title ''Exemplar Humanae Vitae'' (Example of a Human Life). It tells the story of his life and intellectual development, his experience as a victim of [[Religious intolerance|intolerance]]. It also expresses [[rationalism|rationalistic]] and skeptical views: It doubts whether biblical law was divinely sanctioned or whether it was simply written down by [[Moses]]. It suggests that all [[religion]] was a human invention, and specifically rejects formalized, ritualized religion. It sketches a religion to be based only on [[natural law]], as god has no use for empty ceremony, nor for violence and strife.\n\nTwo reports agree that Costa committed suicide<ref>Salomon & Sassoon, introduction to da Costa's Examination of Pharisaic Traditions, 1993 [p. 23].</ref> in Amsterdam in 1640: [[:w:de:Johannes M\u00fcller (Pastor)|Johannes M\u00fcller]], a Protestant theologian of [[Hamburg]] gives the time as April, and Amsterdam [[Remonstrants|Remonstrant]] preacher [[Philipp van Limborch]] adds that he set out to end the lives of both his brother (or nephew) and himself.

He has also been seen as a precursor to [[Baruch Spinoza]] and to modern [[biblical criticism]].\n\nCosta is also indicative of the difficulty that many ''[[Marrano]]s'' faced upon their arrival in an organized Jewish community. As a [[Crypto-Judaism|Crypto-Jew]] in [[Iberian Peninsula|Iberia]], he read the Bible and was impressed by it. Yet upon confronting an organized Rabbinic community, he was not equally impressed by the established ritual and religious doctrine of Rabbinical Judaism, such as the [[Oral Torah|Oral Law]].  As da Costa himself pointed out, traditional [[Pharisee]] and Rabbinic doctrine had been contested in the past by the [[Sadducees]] and the present by the [[Karaite Judaism|Karaites]].\n\n==Writings==\n*''Propostas contra a Tradi\u00e7\u00e3o'' (Propositions against the Tradition), ca. 1616.

This would later become the first classic play to be translated into [[Yiddish]], and it was a longtime standard of [[Yiddish theater]]; Uriel Acosta is the signature role of the actor Rafalesco, the protagonist of [[Sholem Aleichem]]'s ''[[Wandering Stars (novel)|Wandering Stars]]''. The first translation into Yiddish was by [[Osip Mikhailovich Lerner]], who staged the play at the [[Mariinski Theater]] in [[Odessa]], [[Ukraine]] (then part of [[Imperial Russia]]) in 1881, shortly after the assassination of [[Tsar]] [[Alexander II of Russia|Alexander II]].

Rosenberg's production starred [[Jacob Pavlovich Adler|Jacob Adler]] in the title role; the play would remain a signature piece in Adler's repertoire to the end of his stage career, the first of the several roles through which he developed the persona that he referred to as \"the Grand Jew\" (see also Adler's ''Memoir'' in the References below).\n* [[Hermann Jellinek]] (brother of [[Adolf Jellinek]]) wrote a book entitled ''Uriel Acosta ''(1848).<ref>http://www.jewishencyclopedia.com/articles/8582-jellinek#anchor6</ref>\n* [[Israel Zangwill]] used the life of Uriel da Costa as one of several fictionalized biographies in his book \"Dreamers of the Ghetto\".\n* Agustina Bessa-Lu\u00eds, Portuguese writer  (1922- ) published in 1984 the novel \"Um bicho da terra\" (An Animal of the Earth) based on Uriel's life.\n\n==See also==\n* [[Criticism of Judaism]]\n* [[Criticism of the Talmud]]\n\n==Notes==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==References==\n* {{Cite book| url=https://archive.org/details/dieschriftendesu00acos |title= Die Schriften des Uriel da Costa.

His ancestors were ''Crist\u00e3os-novos'', or [[New Christians]], [[Religious conversion|converted]] from [[Judaism]] to [[Roman Catholicism|Catholicism]] [[Persecution of Jews and Muslims by Manuel I of Portugal|by state edict]] at 1497.<ref>Salomon & Sassoon, introduction to da Costa's Examination of Pharisaic Traditions, 1993 [p. 2].</ref> His father was a well-off international merchant and [[tax-farmer]].<ref>Salomon & Sassoon, introduction to da Costa's Examination of Pharisaic Traditions, 1993 [p. 4].</ref>\n\nStudying [[Canon law of the Catholic Church|canon law]] in the [[University of Coimbra]] intermittently between 1600 and 1608, he began to read the [[Bible]] and contemplate it seriously.

However they had been subjects to several investigations by the [[Portuguese Inquisition|Inquisition]], suggesting they were [[Marrano|Conversos]], more or less close to Jewish customs. Gabriel explicitly supported the adherence to [[Mosaic authorship|Mosaic]] prescriptions as well as traditional ones.<ref>{{Cite book|url=|title=In the shadow of history : Jews and conversos at the dawn of modernity|last=Faur|first=Jos\u00e9|date=1992|publisher=State University of New York Press|year=|isbn=9780791408018|location=|pages=esp. 123|oclc=878665784}}</ref>\n\nAfter his father died, the family came into greater financial difficulties due to some debts that had not been paid. In 1614 they changed this predicament as they sneaked out of Portugal with a significant sum of money they previously collected as tax-farmers for [[:pt:Jorge de Mascarenhas|Jorge de Mascarenhas]]. The family took Jewish names, and headed to two major [[Sephardi Jews|Sephardic]] [[diaspora]] communities. Newly circumcised, two brothers settled in [[Amsterdam]], and two with their mother in [[Hamburg]].

All resumed their international trade business.<ref>Salomon & Sassoon, introduction to da Costa's Examination of Pharisaic Traditions, 1993 [p. 6-8].</ref> \n\nUpon arriving there, Costa quickly became disenchanted with the kind of Judaism he saw in practice. He came to believe that the [[rabbi]]nic leadership was too consumed by [[ritual]]ism and [[Halakha|legalistic]] posturing. His earliest known written message is known as ''Propostas contra a Tradi\u00e7\u00e3o'' (Propositions against the Tradition).<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://archive.org/details/dieschriftendesu00acos|title=Die Schriften des Uriel da Costa|last=Acosta|first=Uriel|last2=Gebhardt|first2=Carl|date=1922-01-01|publisher=Amsterdam, M.

It suggests that all [[religion]] was a human invention, and specifically rejects formalized, ritualized religion. It sketches a religion to be based only on [[natural law]], as god has no use for empty ceremony, nor for violence and strife.\n\nTwo reports agree that Costa committed suicide<ref>Salomon & Sassoon, introduction to da Costa's Examination of Pharisaic Traditions, 1993 [p. 23].</ref> in Amsterdam in 1640: [[:w:de:Johannes M\u00fcller (Pastor)|Johannes M\u00fcller]], a Protestant theologian of [[Hamburg]] gives the time as April, and Amsterdam [[Remonstrants|Remonstrant]] preacher [[Philipp van Limborch]] adds that he set out to end the lives of both his brother (or nephew) and himself.

He has also been seen as a precursor to [[Baruch Spinoza]] and to modern [[biblical criticism]].\n\nCosta is also indicative of the difficulty that many ''[[Marrano]]s'' faced upon their arrival in an organized Jewish community. As a [[Crypto-Judaism|Crypto-Jew]] in [[Iberian Peninsula|Iberia]], he read the Bible and was impressed by it. Yet upon confronting an organized Rabbinic community, he was not equally impressed by the established ritual and religious doctrine of Rabbinical Judaism, such as the [[Oral Torah|Oral Law]].  As da Costa himself pointed out, traditional [[Pharisee]] and Rabbinic doctrine had been contested in the past by the [[Sadducees]] and the present by the [[Karaite Judaism|Karaites]].\n\n==Writings==\n*''Propostas contra a Tradi\u00e7\u00e3o'' (Propositions against the Tradition), ca. 1616. An untitled letter addressed at certain Rabbis, opposing their extra-biblical traditions.\n*''Exame das tradi\u00e7\u00f5es phariseas'' (Examination of Pharisaic Traditions), 1623. Here, Costa argues that the human [[Soul (spirit)|soul]] is not [[Immortality|immortal]].\n*''Exemplar humanae vitae'' ([[Latin]] for ''Example of a human life''), 1640. Costa's life, questions the authorship of Torah, and expresses trust in natural law.\n\n==Works based upon Costa's life==\n* In 1846, in the midst of the [[liberalism|liberal]] milieu that led to the [[Revolutions of 1848]], the [[Germany|German]] writer [[Karl Gutzkow]] (1811\u20131878) wrote ''Uriel Acosta'', a play about Costa's life. This would later become the first classic play to be translated into [[Yiddish]], and it was a longtime standard of [[Yiddish theater]]; Uriel Acosta is the signature role of the actor Rafalesco, the protagonist of [[Sholem Aleichem]]'s ''[[Wandering Stars (novel)|Wandering Stars]]''. The first translation into Yiddish was by [[Osip Mikhailovich Lerner]], who staged the play at the [[Mariinski Theater]] in [[Odessa]], [[Ukraine]] (then part of [[Imperial Russia]]) in 1881, shortly after the assassination of [[Tsar]] [[Alexander II of Russia|Alexander II]]. [[Abraham Goldfaden]] rapidly followed with a rival production, an [[operetta]], at Odessa's [[Remesleni Club]]. [[Israel Rosenberg]] promptly followed with his own translation for a production in [[\u0141\u00f3d\u017a]] (in modern-day [[Poland]]). Rosenberg's production starred [[Jacob Pavlovich Adler|Jacob Adler]] in the title role; the play would remain a signature piece in Adler's repertoire to the end of his stage career, the first of the several roles through which he developed the persona that he referred to as \"the Grand Jew\" (see also Adler's ''Memoir'' in the References below).\n* [[Hermann Jellinek]] (brother of [[Adolf Jellinek]]) wrote a book entitled ''Uriel Acosta ''(1848).<ref>http://www.jewishencyclopedia.com/articles/8582-jellinek#anchor6</ref>\n* [[Israel Zangwill]] used the life of Uriel da Costa as one of several fictionalized biographies in his book \"Dreamers of the Ghetto\".\n* Agustina Bessa-Lu\u00eds, Portuguese writer  (1922- ) published in 1984 the novel \"Um bicho da terra\" (An Animal of the Earth) based on Uriel's life.\n\n==See also==\n* [[Criticism of Judaism]]\n* [[Criticism of the Talmud]]\n\n==Notes==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==References==\n* {{Cite book| url=https://archive.org/details/dieschriftendesu00acos |title= Die Schriften des Uriel da Costa.

The city has also been the site of a number of battles between various groups of people on the steppes.\n\nNow administered as a county-level unit, Kashgar is the administrative centre of [[Kashgar Prefecture]], which has an area of {{convert|162000|km\u00b2}} and a population of approximately 4 million as of 2010.<ref>{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=OkAVAgAAQBAJ&pg=PA65|pages=65\u201366 |title=Eurasian Corridors of Interconnection: From the South China to the Caspian Sea|editors= Susan M.

The city was made into a [[Special economic zones of China|Special Economic Zone]] in 2010, the only city in western China with this distinction. Kashgar also forms a terminus of the [[Karakoram Highway]], whose reconstruction is considered a major part of the multibillion-dollar [[China\u2013Pakistan Economic Corridor]].\n\n==Name==\n{{stack|[[File:Kashgar-casco-viejo-d07.jpg|thumb|An old Kashgar city street]]}}\nThe modern [[Chinese language|Chinese]] name is {{lang|zh|\u5580\u4ec0}} ({{zh|labels=no|p=K\u0101sh\u00ed}}), a shortened form of the longer and less-frequently used {{zh|s=\u5580\u4ec0\u5676\u5c14|labels=no}} (''K\u0101sh\u00edg\u00e1'\u011br''; {{lang-ug|\u0642\u06d5\u0634\u0642\u06d5\u0631}}).

Michael Hogan, the Megalithic Portal, ed. A.

By the time covered by the ''[[Book of the Later Han]]'' (roughly 25 to 170 CE), it had grown to 21,000 households and had 3,000 men able to bear arms.{{citation needed|date=April 2017}}\n\nThe ''Book of the Later Han'' provides a wealth of detail on developments in the region:{{citation needed|date=January 2018}}\n\n{{bquote|In the period of Emperor Wu [140-87 BC], the Western Regions1 were under the control of the Interior [China]. They numbered thirty-six kingdoms. The Imperial Government established a Colonel [in charge of] Envoys there to direct and protect these countries. Emperor Xuan [73-49 BC] changed this title [in 59 BC] to Protector-General.\n\nEmperor Yuan [40-33 BC] installed two Wuji Colonels to take charge of the agricultural garrisons on the frontiers of the king of Nearer Jushi [Turpan].{{citation needed|date=January 2018}}\n\nDuring the time of Emperor Ai [6 BCE - 1 CE] and Emperor Ping [1 - 5 CE], the principalities of the Western Regions split up and formed fifty-five kingdoms. Wang Mang, after he usurped the Throne [in 9 CE], demoted and changed their kings and marquises. Following this, the Western Regions became resentful, and rebelled. They, therefore, broke off all relations with the Interior [China] and, all together, submitted to the Xiongnu again.{{citation needed|date=January 2018}}\n\nThe Xiongnu collected oppressively heavy taxes and the kingdoms were not able to support their demands. In the middle of the Jianwu period [AD 25-56], they each [Shanshan and Yarkand in 38, and 18 kingdoms in 45], sent envoys to ask if they could submit to the Interior [China], and to express their desire for a Protector-General. Emperor Guangwu, decided that because the Empire was not yet settled [after a long period of civil war], he had no time for outside affairs, and [therefore] finally refused his consent [in 45 CE].{{citation needed|date=January 2018}}\n\nIn the meantime, the Xiongnu became weaker. The king of Suoju [Yarkand], named Xian, wiped out several kingdoms. After Xian\u2019s death [c. 62 CE], they began to attack and fight each other. Xiao Yuan [Tura], Jingjue [Cadota], Ronglu [Niya], and Qiemo [Cherchen] were annexed by Shanshan [the Lop Nur region].

The king of the Yuezhi became very fond of him. Later, Anguo died without leaving a son. His mother directed the government of the kingdom. She agreed with the people of the country to put Yifu (lit. \u201cposthumous child\u201d), who was the son of a full younger brother of Chenpan on the throne as king of Shule (Kashgar). Chenpan heard of this and appealed to the [[Yuezhi]] ([[Kushan]]) king, saying:\n\n: \"Anguo had no son. His relative (Yifu) is weak. If one wants to put on the throne a member of (Anguo\u2019s) mother\u2019s family, I am Yifu\u2019s paternal uncle, it is I who should be king.\"\n\nThe Yuezhi (Kushans) then sent soldiers to escort him back to Shule (Kashgar). The people had previously respected and been fond of Chenpan. Besides, they dreaded the Yuezhi (Kushans). They immediately took the seal and ribbon from Yifu and went to Chenpan, and made him king. Yifu was given the title of Marquis of the town of Pangao [90 li, or 37 km, from Shule].\n\nThen Suoju (Yarkand) continued to resist Yutian (Khotan), and put themselves under Shule (Kashgar).

So, we cannot be sure that this is a reference to the state of affairs during the Cao Wei (220-265), or whether it refers to the situation before the civil war during the Later Han when China lost touch with most foreign countries and came to be divided into three separate kingdoms.\n\nChapter 30 of the ''[[Records of the Three Kingdoms]]'' says that after the beginning of the [[Cao Wei|Wei Dynasty]] (220) the states of the Western Regions did not arrive as before, except for the larger ones such as [[Kucha]], [[Khotan]], [[Kangju]], [[Wusun]], Kashgar, [[Yuezhi]], [[Shanshan]] and [[Turpan]], who are said to have come to present tribute every year, as in Han times.\n\n[[File:Silk Road 1992.jpg|thumb|right|upright=1.1|Camels traversing the old [[silk road]] in 1992]]\n\nIn 270, four states from the Western Regions were said to have presented tribute: [[Karashahr]], [[Turpan]], [[Shanshan]], and [[Kucha]]. Some wooden documents from [[Niya (Tarim Basin)|Niya]] seem to indicate that contacts were also maintained with Kashgar and Khotan around this time.\n\nIn 422, according to the ''Songshu'', ch. 98, the king of Shanshan, Bilong, came to the court and \"the thirty-six states in the Western Regions\" all swore their allegiance and presented tribute. It must be assumed that these 36 states included Kashgar.\n\nThe \"Songji\" of the [[Zizhi Tongjian]] records that in the 5th month of 435, nine states: Kucha, Kashgar, Wusun, Yueban, Tashkurghan, Shanshan, Karashahr, Turpan and Sute all came to the Wei court.\n\nIn 439, according to the ''Weishu'', ch. 4A, Shanshan, Kashgar and Karashahr sent envoys to present tribute.\n\nAccording to the ''Weishu'', ch. 102, Chapter on the Western Regions, the kingdoms of Kucha, Kashgar, Wusun, Yueban, Tashkurghan, Shanshan, Karashahr, Turpan and Sute all began sending envoys to present tribute in the Taiyuan reign period (435-440).\n\nIn 453 Kashgar sent envoys to present tribute (''Weishu'', ch. 5), and again in 455.\n\nAn embassy sent during the reign of Wencheng Di (452-466) from the king of Kashgar presented a supposed sacred relic of the Buddha; a dress which was incombustible.\n\nIn 507 Kashgar, is said to have sent envoys in both the 9th and 10th months (''Weishu'', ch. 8).\n\nIn 512, Kashgar sent envoys in the 1st and 5th months. (''Weishu'', ch. 8).\n\nEarly in the 6th century Kashgar is included among the many territories controlled by the Yeda or [[Hephthalite]] Huns, but their empire collapsed at the onslaught of the Western Turks between 563 and 567 who then probably gained control over Kashgar and most of the states in the [[Tarim Basin]].\n\n===Tang dynasty===\n{{Main|Tang campaigns against the Western Turks|Tang campaign against the oasis states|l2=oasis states|Conquest of the Western Turks}}\n\nThe founding of the [[Tang dynasty]] in 618 saw the beginning of a prolonged struggle between China and the Western Turks for control of the Tarim Basin. In 635, the ''[[Old Book of Tang|Tang Annals]]'' reported an emissary from the king of Kashgar to the Tang capital. In 639 there was a second emissary bringing products of Kashgar as a token of submission to the Tang state.\n\nBuddhist scholar [[Xuanzang]] passed through Kashgar (which he referred to as ''Ka-sha'') in 644 on his return journey from [[India]] to China. The Buddhist religion, then beginning to decay in India, was active in Kashgar. Xuanzang recorded that they flattened their babies heads, tattooed their bodies and had green eyes. He reported that Kashgar had abundant crops, fruits and flowers, wove fine woolen stuffs and rugs. Their writing system had been adapted from Indian script but their language was different from that of other countries. The inhabitants were sincere Buddhist adherents and there were some hundreds of monasteries with more than 10,000 followers, all members of the [[Sarvastivadin]] School.\n\nAt around the same era, [[Nestorian Christians]] were establishing bishoprics at [[Herat]], [[Merv]] and [[Samarkand]], whence they subsequently proceeded to Kashgar, and finally to [[China proper]] itself.\n\nIn 646, the Turkic Kagan asked for the hand of a Tang Chinese princess, and in return the Emperor promised Kucha, Khotan, Kashgar, Karashahr and Sarikol as a marriage gift, but this did not happen as planned.\n\nIn a series of campaigns between 652 and 658, with the help of the Uyghurs, the Chinese finally [[Conquest of the Western Turks|defeated the Western Turk tribes]] and took control of all their domains, including the Tarim Basin kingdoms. [[Karakhoja]] was [[Tang campaign against Karakhoja|annexed in 640]], [[Karashahr]] during campaigns [[Tang campaigns against Karasahr|in 644]] and 648, and [[Tang campaign against Kucha|Kucha fell]] in 648.\n\nIn 662 a rebellion broke out in the Western Regions and a Chinese army sent to control it was defeated by the [[Tibet]]ans south of Kashgar.\n\nAfter another defeat of the Tang Chinese forces in 670, the Tibetans gained control of the whole region and completely subjugated Kashgar in 676-8 and retained possession of it until 692, when the Tang dynasty regained control of all their former territories, and retained it for the next fifty years.\n\nIn 722 Kashgar sent 4,000 troops to assist the Chinese to force the \"Tibetans out of \"Little Bolu\" or [[Gilgit, Pakistan|Gilgit]].\n\nIn 728, the king of Kashgar was awarded a brevet by the Chinese emperor.\n\nIn 739, the ''Tangshu'' relates that the governor of the Chinese garrison in Kashgar, with the help of Ferghana, was interfering in the affairs of the [[Turgesh]] tribes as far as [[Taraz|Talas]].\n\n[[File:Kashgar-casco-viejo-d08.jpg|thumb|left|upright=0.9|Mosque entrance in old Kashgar]]\n\nIn 751 the Chinese were defeated by an Arab army in the [[Battle of Talas]]. The [[An Lushan Rebellion]] led to the decline of Tang influence in Central Asia due to the fact that the Tang dynasty was forced to withdraw its troops from the region to fight An Lushan. The Tibetans cut all communication between China and the West in 766.\n\nSoon after the Chinese pilgrim monk Wukong passed through Kashgar in 753. He again reached Kashgar on his return trip from India in 786 and mentions a Chinese deputy governor as well as the local king.\n\n===Battles with Arab Caliphate===\n{{Islam and China|places}}\n\nIn 711, the Arabs invaded Kashgar.<ref>{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=voerPYsAB5wC&pg=PT798&f=false#v=onepage&q&f=false |title=Asia and Oceania: International Dictionary of Historic Places  |editors= Trudy Ring, Noelle Watson, Paul Schellinger |page=598 |publisher=Routledge|year= 2012 |isbn= 978-1-884964-04-6 }}</ref> It is alleged that [[Qutayba ibn Muslim]] in 712-715 had conquered Xinjiang.<ref name=\"Dillon2014\">{{cite book|author=Michael Dillon|title=Xinjiang and the Expansion of Chinese Communist Power: Kashgar in the Early Twentieth Century|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=J2MtBAAAQBAJ&pg=PA7#v=onepage&q&f=false|date=1 August 2014|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-1-317-64721-8|pages=7\u2013}}</ref><ref name=\"Broomhall1910\">{{cite book|author=Marshall Broomhall|title=Islam in China: A Neglected Problem|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ObcNAAAAIAAJ&pg=PA17#v=onepage&q&f=false|year=1910|publisher=Morgan & Scott, Limited|pages=17\u2013}}</ref> Although the Muslim religion from the very commencement sustained checks, it nevertheless made its weight felt upon the independent states of Turkestan to the north and east, and thus acquired a steadily growing influence.

After his death, Kashgar came under the rule of the [[Chagatai Khans]]. [[Marco Polo]] visited the city, which he calls ''Cascar'', about 1273-4 and recorded the presence of numerous [[Nestorian Christians]], who had their own churches. Later In the 14th century, a Chagataid khan [[Tughluq Timur]] converted to Islam, and Islamic tradition began to reassert its ascendancy.\n\n[[File:Kashgar road scene, 1870s.jpg|thumb|left|upright=1.4|Kashgar road scene, 1870s]]\n\nIn 1389\u22121390 [[Tamerlane]] ravaged Kashgar, [[Andijan]] and the intervening country. Kashgar endured a troubled time, and in 1514, on the invasion of the Khan [[Sultan Said Khan|Sultan Said]], was destroyed by [[Mirza Ababakar]], who with the aid of ten thousand men built a new fort with massive defences higher up on the banks of the [[Tuman river]]. The dynasty of the Chagatai Khans collapsed in 1572 with the division of the country among rival factions; soon after, two powerful [[Khoja (Turkestan)|Khoja]] factions, the White and Black Mountaineers ([[Ak Tagh]]liq or Afaqi, and [[Kara Taghliq]] or Ishaqi), arose whose differences and war-making gestures, with the intermittent episode of the [[Oirats]] of [[Dzungaria]], make up much of recorded history in Kashgar until 1759. The [[Dzungar Khanate]] conquered Kashgar and set up the Khoja as their puppet rulers.\n\n=== Qing conquest ===\nThe [[Qing dynasty]] defeated the Dzungar Khanate during the [[Ten Great Campaigns]] and took control of Kashgar in 1759. The conquerors consolidated their authority by settling other ethnics emigrants in the vicinity of a [[Manchu]] garrison.\n\nRumours flew around Central Asia that the Qing planned to launch expeditions towards [[Transoxiana]] and Samarkand, the chiefs of which sought assistance from the [[Afghanistan|Afghan]] king [[Ahmed Shah Abdali]]. The alleged expedition never happened so Ahmad Shah withdrew his forces from Kokand. He also dispatched an ambassador to [[Beijing]] to discuss the situation of the [[Khoja (Turkestan)|Afaqi Khojas]], but the representative was not well received, and Ahmed Shah was too busy fighting off the [[Sikhs]] to attempt to enforce his demands through arms.\n\nThe Qing continued to hold Kashgar with occasional interruptions during the [[Afaqi Khoja revolts]]. One of the most serious of these occurred in 1827, when the city was taken by [[Jahanghir Khoja]]; [[Chang-lung]], however, the Qing general of Ili, regained possession of Kashgar and the other rebellious cities in 1828. \n[[File:Kalmak archer.jpg|upright=0.9|thumb|left|Kalmyk Archer, Kashgar Army in the 1870s]]\n\nThe [[Kokand Khanate]] raided Kashgar several times. A revolt in 1829 under [[Mahommed Ali Khan]] and Yusuf, brother of Jahanghir resulted in the concession of several important trade privileges to the Muslims of the district of [[Altishahr]] (the \"six cities\"), as it was then called.\n\nThe area enjoyed relative calm until 1846 under the rule of [[Zahir-ud-din]], the local Uyghur governor, but in that year a new [[Khoja (Turkestan)|Khoja]] revolt under [[Kath Tora]] led to his accession as the authoritarian ruler of the city. However, his reign was brief{{mdash}}at the end of seventy-five days, on the approach of the Chinese, he fled back to [[Khanate of Kokand|Khokand]] amid the jeers of the inhabitants. The last of the Khoja revolts (1857) was of about equal duration, and took place under [[Wali Khan (khoja)|Wali-Khan]], who murdered the well-known traveler [[Adolf Schlagintweit]].\n\n=== 1862 Chinese Hui revolt ===\nThe great [[Dungan revolt (1862\u20131877)]] involved insurrection among various Muslim ethnic groups. It broke out in 1862 in [[Gansu]] then spread rapidly to [[Dzungaria]] and through the line of towns in the [[Tarim Basin]].\n\n[[Dungan people|Dungan]] troops based in [[Yarkent County|Yarkand]] rose and in August 1864 massacred some seven thousand Chinese and their Manchu commander. The inhabitants of Kashgar, rising in their turn against their masters, invoked the aid of [[Sadik Beg]], a [[Kyrgyz people|Kyrgyz]] chief, who was reinforced by [[Buzurg Khan]], the heir of [[Jahanghir Khoja]], and his general [[Yakub Beg]]. The latter men were dispatched at Sadik's request by the [[Alimqul|ruler of Khokand]] to raise what troops they could to aid his Muslim friends in Kashgar.\n\n[[File:Night interview with King.jpg|thumb|upright=1.2|Night interview with Yakub Beg, King of Kashgaria, 1868]]\n\nSadik Beg soon repented of having asked for a Khoja, and eventually marched against Kashgar, which by this time had succumbed to Buzurg Khan and Yakub Beg, but was defeated and driven back to Khokand.

Thereafter Kashgaria was reconquered by the forces of the [[Qing dynasty|Qing]] general [[Zuo Zongtang]] during the [[Qing reconquest of Xinjiang]].\n\n===Qing rule===\n\nThere were eras in Xinjiang's history where intermarriage was common, and \"laxity\" set upon Uyghur women led them to marry Chinese men in the period after Yakub Beg's rule ended. It is also believed by Uyghurs that some Uyghurs have Han Chinese ancestry from historical intermarriage, such as those living in [[Turpan]].<ref>{{cite book|author=Joanne N.

Because they were viewed as \"outcast\", Islamic cemeteries banned the Uyghur wives of Chinese men from being buried within them. Uyghur women got around this problem by giving shrines donations and buying a grave in other towns.

It is one of the westernmost cities of China, near the border with [[Afghanistan]], [[Kyrgyzstan]], [[Tajikistan]] and [[India]]. With a population of over 500,000, Kashgar has served as a trading post and strategically important city on the [[Silk Road]] between China, the [[Middle East]] and [[Europe]] for over 2,000 years.\n\nAt the convergence point of widely varying cultures and empires, Kashgar has been under the rule of the Chinese, Turkic, Mongol and Tibetan empires. The city has also been the site of a number of battles between various groups of people on the steppes.\n\nNow administered as a county-level unit, Kashgar is the administrative centre of [[Kashgar Prefecture]], which has an area of {{convert|162000|km\u00b2}} and a population of approximately 4 million as of 2010.<ref>{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=OkAVAgAAQBAJ&pg=PA65|pages=65\u201366 |title=Eurasian Corridors of Interconnection: From the South China to the Caspian Sea|editors= Susan M.

The city was made into a [[Special economic zones of China|Special Economic Zone]] in 2010, the only city in western China with this distinction. Kashgar also forms a terminus of the [[Karakoram Highway]], whose reconstruction is considered a major part of the multibillion-dollar [[China\u2013Pakistan Economic Corridor]].\n\n==Name==\n{{stack|[[File:Kashgar-casco-viejo-d07.jpg|thumb|An old Kashgar city street]]}}\nThe modern [[Chinese language|Chinese]] name is {{lang|zh|\u5580\u4ec0}} ({{zh|labels=no|p=K\u0101sh\u00ed}}), a shortened form of the longer and less-frequently used {{zh|s=\u5580\u4ec0\u5676\u5c14|labels=no}} (''K\u0101sh\u00edg\u00e1'\u011br''; {{lang-ug|\u0642\u06d5\u0634\u0642\u06d5\u0631}}).

lands to the west.<ref>[http://www.megalithic.co.uk/article.php?sid=18006 ''Silk Road, North China'', C. Michael Hogan, the Megalithic Portal, ed. A. Burnham]</ref>\n\nAnother early mention of Kashgar is during the [[Former Han]] (also known as the [[Western Han dynasty]]), when in 76 BCE the Chinese conquered the [[Xiongnu]], Yutian ([[Khotan]]), Sulei (Kashgar), and a group of states in the [[Tarim basin]] almost up to the foot of the [[Tian Shan]] range.{{citation needed|date=January 2018}}\n\n[[Ptolemy]] speaks of [[Scythia]] beyond the [[Imaus]], which is in a \u201cKasia Regio\u201d, probably exhibiting the name from which Kashgar and Kashgaria (often applied to the district) are formed.<ref>\"The Triple System of Orography in Ptolemy's Xinjiang\", pp. 530\u2013531. \u00c9tienne de la Vaissi\u00e8re.(2009) ''Exegisti monumenta: Festschrift in Honour of Nicholas Sims-Williams''.

By the time covered by the ''[[Book of the Later Han]]'' (roughly 25 to 170 CE), it had grown to 21,000 households and had 3,000 men able to bear arms.{{citation needed|date=April 2017}}\n\nThe ''Book of the Later Han'' provides a wealth of detail on developments in the region:{{citation needed|date=January 2018}}\n\n{{bquote|In the period of Emperor Wu [140-87 BC], the Western Regions1 were under the control of the Interior [China]. They numbered thirty-six kingdoms. The Imperial Government established a Colonel [in charge of] Envoys there to direct and protect these countries. Emperor Xuan [73-49 BC] changed this title [in 59 BC] to Protector-General.\n\nEmperor Yuan [40-33 BC] installed two Wuji Colonels to take charge of the agricultural garrisons on the frontiers of the king of Nearer Jushi [Turpan].{{citation needed|date=January 2018}}\n\nDuring the time of Emperor Ai [6 BCE - 1 CE] and Emperor Ping [1 - 5 CE], the principalities of the Western Regions split up and formed fifty-five kingdoms. Wang Mang, after he usurped the Throne [in 9 CE], demoted and changed their kings and marquises. Following this, the Western Regions became resentful, and rebelled. They, therefore, broke off all relations with the Interior [China] and, all together, submitted to the Xiongnu again.{{citation needed|date=January 2018}}\n\nThe Xiongnu collected oppressively heavy taxes and the kingdoms were not able to support their demands. In the middle of the Jianwu period [AD 25-56], they each [Shanshan and Yarkand in 38, and 18 kingdoms in 45], sent envoys to ask if they could submit to the Interior [China], and to express their desire for a Protector-General. Emperor Guangwu, decided that because the Empire was not yet settled [after a long period of civil war], he had no time for outside affairs, and [therefore] finally refused his consent [in 45 CE].{{citation needed|date=January 2018}}\n\nIn the meantime, the Xiongnu became weaker. The king of Suoju [Yarkand], named Xian, wiped out several kingdoms. After Xian\u2019s death [c. 62 CE], they began to attack and fight each other. Xiao Yuan [Tura], Jingjue [Cadota], Ronglu [Niya], and Qiemo [Cherchen] were annexed by Shanshan [the Lop Nur region]. Qule [south of Keriya] and Pishan [modern Pishan or Guma] were conquered and fully occupied by Yutian [Khotan]. Yuli [Fukang], Danhuan, Guhu [Dawan Cheng], and Wutanzili were destroyed by Jushi [Turpan and Jimasa]. Later these kingdoms were re-established.{{citation needed|date=January 2018}}\n\nDuring the Yongping period [58 - 75 CE], the Northern Xiongnu forced several countries to help them plunder the commanderies and districts of Hexi. The gates of the towns stayed shut in broad daylight.\"<ref name=\"Hill2009\">{{Cite book |title=Through the Jade Gate to Rome: A Study of the Silk Routes during the Later Han Dynasty, 1st to 2nd Centuries CE |year=2009 |first=John E. |last=Hill |publisher=BookSurge, Charleston, South Carolina |ISBN = 978-1-4392-2134-1}}</ref>{{rp|3}}}}\n\nMore particularly, in reference to Kashgar itself, is the following record:{{citation needed|date=January 2018}}\n\n{{bquote|In the sixteenth Yongping year of Emperor Ming 73, Jian, the king of Qiuci ([[Kucha]]), attacked and killed Cheng, the king of Shule (Kashgar). Then he appointed the Qiuci (Kucha) Marquis of the Left, Douti, King of Shule (Kashgar).\n\nIn winter 73 CE, the Han sent the Major [[Ban Chao]] who captured and bound Douti. He appointed Zhong, the son of the elder brother of Cheng, to be king of Shule (Kashgar). Zhong later rebelled. (Ban) Chao attacked and beheaded him.<ref name=\"Hill2009\"/>{{rp|43}}}}\n\n=== The Kushans ===\n[[File:Kashgar.jpg|thumb|upright=1.2|Kashgar's Sunday market.]]\nThe ''Book of the Later Han'' also gives the only extant historical record of [[Yuezhi]] or [[Kushan]] involvement in the Kashgar oasis:\n\n{{bquote|During the Yuanchu period (114-120) in the reign of Emperor, the king of Shule (Kashgar), exiled his maternal uncle Chenpan to the Yuezhi (Kushans) for some offence. The king of the Yuezhi became very fond of him. Later, Anguo died without leaving a son. His mother directed the government of the kingdom. She agreed with the people of the country to put Yifu (lit. \u201cposthumous child\u201d), who was the son of a full younger brother of Chenpan on the throne as king of Shule (Kashgar). Chenpan heard of this and appealed to the [[Yuezhi]] ([[Kushan]]) king, saying:\n\n: \"Anguo had no son. His relative (Yifu) is weak. If one wants to put on the throne a member of (Anguo\u2019s) mother\u2019s family, I am Yifu\u2019s paternal uncle, it is I who should be king.\"\n\nThe Yuezhi (Kushans) then sent soldiers to escort him back to Shule (Kashgar). The people had previously respected and been fond of Chenpan. Besides, they dreaded the Yuezhi (Kushans). They immediately took the seal and ribbon from Yifu and went to Chenpan, and made him king. Yifu was given the title of Marquis of the town of Pangao [90 li, or 37 km, from Shule].\n\nThen Suoju (Yarkand) continued to resist Yutian (Khotan), and put themselves under Shule (Kashgar). Thus Shule (Kashgar), became powerful and a rival to Qiuci (Kucha) and Yutian (Khotan).\"<ref name=\"Hill2009\"/>{{rp|43}}\n}}\n\nHowever, it was not very long before the Chinese began to reassert their authority in the region:\n\n{{bquote|In the second Yongjian year (127), during Emperor Shun\u2019s reign, Chenpan sent an envoy to respectfully present offerings. The Emperor bestowed on Chenpan the title of Great Commandant-in-Chief for the Han. Chenxun, who was the son of his elder brother, was appointed Temporary Major of the Kingdom.\n\nIn the fifth year (130), Chenpan sent his son to serve the Emperor and, along with envoys from Dayuan (Ferghana) and Suoju (Yarkand), brought tribute and offerings.<ref name=\"Hill2009\"/>{{rp|43}}}}\n\nFrom an earlier part of the same text comes the following addition:\n\n{{bquote|In the first Yangjia year (132), Xu You sent the king of Shule (Kashgar), Chenpan, who with 20,000 men, attacked and defeated Yutian (Khotan). He beheaded several hundred people, and released his soldiers to plunder freely. He replaced the king [of Jumi] by installing Chengguo from the family of [the previous king] Xing, and then he returned.<ref name=\"Hill2009\"/>{{rp|15}}}}\n\nThen the first passage continues:\n\n{{bquote|In the second Yangjia year (133), Chenpan again made offerings (including) a lion and zebu cattle.\n\nThen, during Emperor Ling\u2019s reign, in the first Jianning year [168], the king of Shule (Kashgar) and Commandant-in-Chief for the Han (i.e. presumably Chenpan), was killed while hunting by the youngest of his paternal uncles, Hede. Hede named himself king.\n\nIn the third year (170), Meng Tuo, the Inspector of Liangzhou, sent the Provincial Officer Ren She, commanding five hundred soldiers from Dunhuang, with the Wuji Major Cao Kuan, and Chief Clerk of the Western Regions, Zhang Yan, brought troops from Yanqi ([[Karashahr]]), Qiuci (Kucha), and the Nearer and Further States of Jushi (Turpan and Jimasa), altogether numbering more than 30,000, to punish Shule (Kashgar). They attacked the town of Zhenzhong [Arach \u2212 near Maralbashi] but, having stayed for more than forty days without being able to subdue it, they withdrew. Following this, the kings of Shule (Kashgar) killed one another repeatedly while the Imperial Government was unable to prevent it.<ref name=\"Hill2009\"/>{{rp|43, 45}}}}\n\n=== Three Kingdoms to the Sui dynasty ===\nThese centuries are marked by a general silence in sources on Kashgar and the Tarim Basin.\n\nThe ''[[Weil\u00fce]]'', composed in the second third of the 3rd century, mentions a number of states as dependencies of Kashgar: the kingdom of Zhenzhong (Arach?), the kingdom of Suoju (Yarkand), the kingdom of Jieshi, the kingdom of Qusha, the kingdom of Xiye (Khargalik), the kingdom of Yinai (Tashkurghan), the kingdom of Manli (modern Karasul), the kingdom of Yire (Mazar \u2212 also known as T\u00e1gh N\u00e1k and Tokanak), the kingdom of Yuling, the kingdom of Juandu (\u2018Tax Control\u2019 \u2212 near modern Irkeshtam), the kingdom of Xiuxiu (\u2018Excellent Rest Stop\u2019 \u2212 near Karakavak), and the kingdom of Qin.\n\nHowever, much of the information on the Western Regions contained in the ''Weil\u00fce'' seems to have ended roughly about (170), near the end of Han power. So, we cannot be sure that this is a reference to the state of affairs during the Cao Wei (220-265), or whether it refers to the situation before the civil war during the Later Han when China lost touch with most foreign countries and came to be divided into three separate kingdoms.\n\nChapter 30 of the ''[[Records of the Three Kingdoms]]'' says that after the beginning of the [[Cao Wei|Wei Dynasty]] (220) the states of the Western Regions did not arrive as before, except for the larger ones such as [[Kucha]], [[Khotan]], [[Kangju]], [[Wusun]], Kashgar, [[Yuezhi]], [[Shanshan]] and [[Turpan]], who are said to have come to present tribute every year, as in Han times.\n\n[[File:Silk Road 1992.jpg|thumb|right|upright=1.1|Camels traversing the old [[silk road]] in 1992]]\n\nIn 270, four states from the Western Regions were said to have presented tribute: [[Karashahr]], [[Turpan]], [[Shanshan]], and [[Kucha]]. Some wooden documents from [[Niya (Tarim Basin)|Niya]] seem to indicate that contacts were also maintained with Kashgar and Khotan around this time.\n\nIn 422, according to the ''Songshu'', ch. 98, the king of Shanshan, Bilong, came to the court and \"the thirty-six states in the Western Regions\" all swore their allegiance and presented tribute. It must be assumed that these 36 states included Kashgar.\n\nThe \"Songji\" of the [[Zizhi Tongjian]] records that in the 5th month of 435, nine states: Kucha, Kashgar, Wusun, Yueban, Tashkurghan, Shanshan, Karashahr, Turpan and Sute all came to the Wei court.\n\nIn 439, according to the ''Weishu'', ch. 4A, Shanshan, Kashgar and Karashahr sent envoys to present tribute.\n\nAccording to the ''Weishu'', ch. 102, Chapter on the Western Regions, the kingdoms of Kucha, Kashgar, Wusun, Yueban, Tashkurghan, Shanshan, Karashahr, Turpan and Sute all began sending envoys to present tribute in the Taiyuan reign period (435-440).\n\nIn 453 Kashgar sent envoys to present tribute (''Weishu'', ch. 5), and again in 455.\n\nAn embassy sent during the reign of Wencheng Di (452-466) from the king of Kashgar presented a supposed sacred relic of the Buddha; a dress which was incombustible.\n\nIn 507 Kashgar, is said to have sent envoys in both the 9th and 10th months (''Weishu'', ch. 8).\n\nIn 512, Kashgar sent envoys in the 1st and 5th months. (''Weishu'', ch. 8).\n\nEarly in the 6th century Kashgar is included among the many territories controlled by the Yeda or [[Hephthalite]] Huns, but their empire collapsed at the onslaught of the Western Turks between 563 and 567 who then probably gained control over Kashgar and most of the states in the [[Tarim Basin]].\n\n===Tang dynasty===\n{{Main|Tang campaigns against the Western Turks|Tang campaign against the oasis states|l2=oasis states|Conquest of the Western Turks}}\n\nThe founding of the [[Tang dynasty]] in 618 saw the beginning of a prolonged struggle between China and the Western Turks for control of the Tarim Basin. In 635, the ''[[Old Book of Tang|Tang Annals]]'' reported an emissary from the king of Kashgar to the Tang capital. In 639 there was a second emissary bringing products of Kashgar as a token of submission to the Tang state.\n\nBuddhist scholar [[Xuanzang]] passed through Kashgar (which he referred to as ''Ka-sha'') in 644 on his return journey from [[India]] to China. The Buddhist religion, then beginning to decay in India, was active in Kashgar. Xuanzang recorded that they flattened their babies heads, tattooed their bodies and had green eyes. He reported that Kashgar had abundant crops, fruits and flowers, wove fine woolen stuffs and rugs. Their writing system had been adapted from Indian script but their language was different from that of other countries. The inhabitants were sincere Buddhist adherents and there were some hundreds of monasteries with more than 10,000 followers, all members of the [[Sarvastivadin]] School.\n\nAt around the same era, [[Nestorian Christians]] were establishing bishoprics at [[Herat]], [[Merv]] and [[Samarkand]], whence they subsequently proceeded to Kashgar, and finally to [[China proper]] itself.\n\nIn 646, the Turkic Kagan asked for the hand of a Tang Chinese princess, and in return the Emperor promised Kucha, Khotan, Kashgar, Karashahr and Sarikol as a marriage gift, but this did not happen as planned.\n\nIn a series of campaigns between 652 and 658, with the help of the Uyghurs, the Chinese finally [[Conquest of the Western Turks|defeated the Western Turk tribes]] and took control of all their domains, including the Tarim Basin kingdoms. [[Karakhoja]] was [[Tang campaign against Karakhoja|annexed in 640]], [[Karashahr]] during campaigns [[Tang campaigns against Karasahr|in 644]] and 648, and [[Tang campaign against Kucha|Kucha fell]] in 648.\n\nIn 662 a rebellion broke out in the Western Regions and a Chinese army sent to control it was defeated by the [[Tibet]]ans south of Kashgar.\n\nAfter another defeat of the Tang Chinese forces in 670, the Tibetans gained control of the whole region and completely subjugated Kashgar in 676-8 and retained possession of it until 692, when the Tang dynasty regained control of all their former territories, and retained it for the next fifty years.\n\nIn 722 Kashgar sent 4,000 troops to assist the Chinese to force the \"Tibetans out of \"Little Bolu\" or [[Gilgit, Pakistan|Gilgit]].\n\nIn 728, the king of Kashgar was awarded a brevet by the Chinese emperor.\n\nIn 739, the ''Tangshu'' relates that the governor of the Chinese garrison in Kashgar, with the help of Ferghana, was interfering in the affairs of the [[Turgesh]] tribes as far as [[Taraz|Talas]].\n\n[[File:Kashgar-casco-viejo-d08.jpg|thumb|left|upright=0.9|Mosque entrance in old Kashgar]]\n\nIn 751 the Chinese were defeated by an Arab army in the [[Battle of Talas]]. The [[An Lushan Rebellion]] led to the decline of Tang influence in Central Asia due to the fact that the Tang dynasty was forced to withdraw its troops from the region to fight An Lushan. The Tibetans cut all communication between China and the West in 766.\n\nSoon after the Chinese pilgrim monk Wukong passed through Kashgar in 753. He again reached Kashgar on his return trip from India in 786 and mentions a Chinese deputy governor as well as the local king.\n\n===Battles with Arab Caliphate===\n{{Islam and China|places}}\n\nIn 711, the Arabs invaded Kashgar.<ref>{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=voerPYsAB5wC&pg=PT798&f=false#v=onepage&q&f=false |title=Asia and Oceania: International Dictionary of Historic Places  |editors= Trudy Ring, Noelle Watson, Paul Schellinger |page=598 |publisher=Routledge|year= 2012 |isbn= 978-1-884964-04-6 }}</ref> It is alleged that [[Qutayba ibn Muslim]] in 712-715 had conquered Xinjiang.<ref name=\"Dillon2014\">{{cite book|author=Michael Dillon|title=Xinjiang and the Expansion of Chinese Communist Power: Kashgar in the Early Twentieth Century|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=J2MtBAAAQBAJ&pg=PA7#v=onepage&q&f=false|date=1 August 2014|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-1-317-64721-8|pages=7\u2013}}</ref><ref name=\"Broomhall1910\">{{cite book|author=Marshall Broomhall|title=Islam in China: A Neglected Problem|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ObcNAAAAIAAJ&pg=PA17#v=onepage&q&f=false|year=1910|publisher=Morgan & Scott, Limited|pages=17\u2013}}</ref> Although the Muslim religion from the very commencement sustained checks, it nevertheless made its weight felt upon the independent states of Turkestan to the north and east, and thus acquired a steadily growing influence.

After his death, Kashgar came under the rule of the [[Chagatai Khans]]. [[Marco Polo]] visited the city, which he calls ''Cascar'', about 1273-4 and recorded the presence of numerous [[Nestorian Christians]], who had their own churches. Later In the 14th century, a Chagataid khan [[Tughluq Timur]] converted to Islam, and Islamic tradition began to reassert its ascendancy.\n\n[[File:Kashgar road scene, 1870s.jpg|thumb|left|upright=1.4|Kashgar road scene, 1870s]]\n\nIn 1389\u22121390 [[Tamerlane]] ravaged Kashgar, [[Andijan]] and the intervening country. Kashgar endured a troubled time, and in 1514, on the invasion of the Khan [[Sultan Said Khan|Sultan Said]], was destroyed by [[Mirza Ababakar]], who with the aid of ten thousand men built a new fort with massive defences higher up on the banks of the [[Tuman river]]. The dynasty of the Chagatai Khans collapsed in 1572 with the division of the country among rival factions; soon after, two powerful [[Khoja (Turkestan)|Khoja]] factions, the White and Black Mountaineers ([[Ak Tagh]]liq or Afaqi, and [[Kara Taghliq]] or Ishaqi), arose whose differences and war-making gestures, with the intermittent episode of the [[Oirats]] of [[Dzungaria]], make up much of recorded history in Kashgar until 1759. The [[Dzungar Khanate]] conquered Kashgar and set up the Khoja as their puppet rulers.\n\n=== Qing conquest ===\nThe [[Qing dynasty]] defeated the Dzungar Khanate during the [[Ten Great Campaigns]] and took control of Kashgar in 1759. The conquerors consolidated their authority by settling other ethnics emigrants in the vicinity of a [[Manchu]] garrison.\n\nRumours flew around Central Asia that the Qing planned to launch expeditions towards [[Transoxiana]] and Samarkand, the chiefs of which sought assistance from the [[Afghanistan|Afghan]] king [[Ahmed Shah Abdali]]. The alleged expedition never happened so Ahmad Shah withdrew his forces from Kokand. He also dispatched an ambassador to [[Beijing]] to discuss the situation of the [[Khoja (Turkestan)|Afaqi Khojas]], but the representative was not well received, and Ahmed Shah was too busy fighting off the [[Sikhs]] to attempt to enforce his demands through arms.\n\nThe Qing continued to hold Kashgar with occasional interruptions during the [[Afaqi Khoja revolts]]. One of the most serious of these occurred in 1827, when the city was taken by [[Jahanghir Khoja]]; [[Chang-lung]], however, the Qing general of Ili, regained possession of Kashgar and the other rebellious cities in 1828. \n[[File:Kalmak archer.jpg|upright=0.9|thumb|left|Kalmyk Archer, Kashgar Army in the 1870s]]\n\nThe [[Kokand Khanate]] raided Kashgar several times. A revolt in 1829 under [[Mahommed Ali Khan]] and Yusuf, brother of Jahanghir resulted in the concession of several important trade privileges to the Muslims of the district of [[Altishahr]] (the \"six cities\"), as it was then called.\n\nThe area enjoyed relative calm until 1846 under the rule of [[Zahir-ud-din]], the local Uyghur governor, but in that year a new [[Khoja (Turkestan)|Khoja]] revolt under [[Kath Tora]] led to his accession as the authoritarian ruler of the city. However, his reign was brief{{mdash}}at the end of seventy-five days, on the approach of the Chinese, he fled back to [[Khanate of Kokand|Khokand]] amid the jeers of the inhabitants. The last of the Khoja revolts (1857) was of about equal duration, and took place under [[Wali Khan (khoja)|Wali-Khan]], who murdered the well-known traveler [[Adolf Schlagintweit]].\n\n=== 1862 Chinese Hui revolt ===\nThe great [[Dungan revolt (1862\u20131877)]] involved insurrection among various Muslim ethnic groups. It broke out in 1862 in [[Gansu]] then spread rapidly to [[Dzungaria]] and through the line of towns in the [[Tarim Basin]].\n\n[[Dungan people|Dungan]] troops based in [[Yarkent County|Yarkand]] rose and in August 1864 massacred some seven thousand Chinese and their Manchu commander. The inhabitants of Kashgar, rising in their turn against their masters, invoked the aid of [[Sadik Beg]], a [[Kyrgyz people|Kyrgyz]] chief, who was reinforced by [[Buzurg Khan]], the heir of [[Jahanghir Khoja]], and his general [[Yakub Beg]]. The latter men were dispatched at Sadik's request by the [[Alimqul|ruler of Khokand]] to raise what troops they could to aid his Muslim friends in Kashgar.\n\n[[File:Night interview with King.jpg|thumb|upright=1.2|Night interview with Yakub Beg, King of Kashgaria, 1868]]\n\nSadik Beg soon repented of having asked for a Khoja, and eventually marched against Kashgar, which by this time had succumbed to Buzurg Khan and Yakub Beg, but was defeated and driven back to Khokand. Buzurg Khan delivered himself up to indolence and debauchery, but Yakub Beg, with singular energy and perseverance, made himself master of [[Yangishahr|Yangi Shahr]], [[Yangihissar|Yangi-Hissar]], [[Yarkent County|Yarkand]] and other towns, and eventually became sole master of the country, Buzurg Khan proving himself totally unfit for the post of ruler.\n\nWith the overthrow of Chinese rule in 1865 by Yakub Beg (1820\u20131877), the manufacturing industries of Kashgar are supposed to have declined.\n\nYaqub Beg entered into relations and signed treaties with the [[Russian Empire]] and the [[British Empire]], but when he tried to get their support against China, he failed.\n\nKashgar and the other cities of the Tarim Basin remained under Yakub Beg's rule until May 1877, when he died at [[Korla]]. Thereafter Kashgaria was reconquered by the forces of the [[Qing dynasty|Qing]] general [[Zuo Zongtang]] during the [[Qing reconquest of Xinjiang]].\n\n===Qing rule===\n\nThere were eras in Xinjiang's history where intermarriage was common, and \"laxity\" set upon Uyghur women led them to marry Chinese men in the period after Yakub Beg's rule ended. It is also believed by Uyghurs that some Uyghurs have Han Chinese ancestry from historical intermarriage, such as those living in [[Turpan]].<ref>{{cite book|author=Joanne N.

Because they were viewed as \"outcast\", Islamic cemeteries banned the Uyghur wives of Chinese men from being buried within them. Uyghur women got around this problem by giving shrines donations and buying a grave in other towns. Besides Chinese men, other men such as [[Hindus]], [[Armenians]], [[Jews]], [[Russians]], and [[Badakhshan]]is ([[Pamiri people|Pamiris]]) intermarried with local Uyghur women.<ref name=\"Bell\u00e9r-Hann2008\">{{cite book|author=Ildik\u00f3 Bell\u00e9r-Hann|title=Community Matters in Xinjiang, 1880-1949: Towards a Historical Anthropology of the Uyghur|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=cF4lMj8skvoC&pg=PA83|year=2008|publisher=BRILL|isbn=90-04-16675-0}}</ref>{{rp|84}} The local society accepted the Uyghur women and Chinese men's mixed offspring as their own people despite the marriages being in violation of Islamic law.\n\nAn anti-Russian uproar broke out when Russian customs officials, 3 Cossacks and a Russian courier invited local Uyghur prostitutes to a party in January 1902 in Kashgar. There was a general anti-Russian sentiment, but the inflamed local Uyghur populace started a brawl with the Russians on the pretense of protecting their women.

The name of the new school was to be Jackson Academy. The idea for the new school developed during the previous year when ten parents of first grade-aged children got together and decided how their children's first grade instructor, Mr. Loyal Bearss, and his curriculum should be extended through all of elementary school.{{citation needed|date=November 2017}}\n\nJackson Academy, led by founder and headmaster Loyal M Bearss, was to have its foundation on the old educational standards of reading, writing, and arithmetic. The curriculum was both classical and experimental \u2013 classical in that the textbooks were taken from the McGuffey Readers and Webster's Bluebacked Speller; experimental in resurrecting the concept of teaching reading through phonics rather than sight and memorization of words.{{citation needed|date=November 2017}}\n\nIn 1959, Jackson Academy began operation in a renovated residence on Northview Drive in Jackson, MS. The school included first through fourth grade. By 1963 Jackson Academy had grown to some 103 students, after which the JA Corporation purchased {{convert|5.5| acres|ha}} on Ridgewood Road where the main campus is located today.{{citation needed|date=November 2017}}\n\nPeter Jernberg was Jackson Academy's headmaster from July 1988 until November 2005, when he became the school's president.

The name of the new school was to be Jackson Academy. The idea for the new school developed during the previous year when ten parents of first grade-aged children got together and decided how their children's first grade instructor, Mr. Loyal Bearss, and his curriculum should be extended through all of elementary school.{{citation needed|date=November 2017}}\n\nJackson Academy, led by founder and headmaster Loyal M Bearss, was to have its foundation on the old educational standards of reading, writing, and arithmetic. The curriculum was both classical and experimental \u2013 classical in that the textbooks were taken from the McGuffey Readers and Webster's Bluebacked Speller; experimental in resurrecting the concept of teaching reading through phonics rather than sight and memorization of words.{{citation needed|date=November 2017}}\n\nIn 1959, Jackson Academy began operation in a renovated residence on Northview Drive in Jackson, MS. The school included first through fourth grade. By 1963 Jackson Academy had grown to some 103 students, after which the JA Corporation purchased {{convert|5.5| acres|ha}} on Ridgewood Road where the main campus is located today.{{citation needed|date=November 2017}}\n\nPeter Jernberg was Jackson Academy's headmaster from July 1988 until November 2005, when he became the school's president.

It is the manifestation of [[thermal energy]], present in all matter, which is the source of the occurrence of [[heat]], a flow of energy, when a body is in contact with another that is colder.\n\nTemperature is [[measurement|measured]] with a [[thermometer]]. Thermometers are calibrated in various [[Conversion of units of temperature|temperature scales]] that historically have used various reference points and thermometric substances for definition. The most common scales are the [[Celsius|Celsius scale]] (formerly called ''centigrade''), denoted \u00b0C, the [[Fahrenheit|Fahrenheit scale]] (denoted \u00b0F), and the [[Kelvin|Kelvin scale]] (denoted K), the latter of which is predominantly used for scientific purposes by conventions of the [[International System of Units]] (SI). \n\nWhen a body has no macroscopic chemical reactions or flows of matter or energy, it is said to be in its own internal state of [[thermodynamic equilibrium]]. Its temperature is uniform in space and unchanging in time. The lowest theoretical temperature is [[absolute zero]], at which no more thermal energy can be extracted from a body. Experimentally, it can only be approached very closely, but not reached, which is recognized in the [[third law of thermodynamics]].\n\nTemperature is important in all fields of [[natural science]], including [[physics]], [[chemistry]], [[Earth science]], [[medicine]], and [[biology]], as well as most aspects of daily life.\n\n==Effects==\nMany physical processes are affected by temperature, such as:\n* the physical properties of materials including the [[Phases of matter|phase]] ([[solid]], [[liquid]], [[gas]]eous or [[Plasma (physics)|plasma]]), [[density]], [[solubility]], [[vapor pressure]], [[electrical conductivity]],\n* the rate and extent to which [[chemical reaction]]s occur,<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=UKkQAQAAMAAJ|title=Thermal discharges at nuclear power stations: their management and environmental impacts : a report prepared by a group of experts as the result of a panel meeting held in Vienna, 23\u201327 October 1972|last=Agency|first=International Atomic Energy|date=1974|publisher=International Atomic Energy Agency}}</ref>\n* the amount and properties of [[thermal radiation]] emitted from the surface of an object, and\n* the [[speed of sound]] which is a function of the square root of the absolute temperature.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=eVpITJfPxMEC&pg=PA34|title=The Art of Digital Audio|last=Watkinson|first=John|date=2001|publisher=Taylor & Francis|isbn=978-0-240-51587-8}}</ref>\n\n==Scales==\n{{see also|Scale of temperature}}\n{{more citations needed section|date=August 2012}}\n\nTemperature scales differ in two ways: the point chosen as zero degrees, and the magnitudes of incremental units or degrees on the scale.\n\n===Commonly used scales===\nThe [[Celsius]] scale (\u00b0C) is used for common temperature measurements in most of the world. It is an empirical scale that was developed by a historical progress, which led to its zero point {{val|0|u=degC}} being defined by the freezing point of water, and additional degrees defined so that {{val|100|u=degC}} was the boiling point of water, both at sea-level atmospheric pressure. Because of the 100-degree interval, it was called a centigrade scale.<ref>Middleton, W.E.K. (1966), pp. 89\u2013105.</ref> Since the standardization of the kelvin in the International System of Units, it has subsequently been redefined in terms of the equivalent fixing points on the Kelvin scale, and so that a temperature increment of one degree Celsius is the same as an increment of one kelvin, though they differ by an additive offset of approximately 273.15.\n\nThe United States commonly uses the [[Fahrenheit]] scale, on which water freezes at {{val|32|u=degF}} and boils at {{val|212|u=degF}} at sea-level atmospheric pressure.\n\n===Absolute zero===\nAt the [[absolute zero]] of temperature, no more energy can be removed from matter as heat, a fact expressed in the [[third law of thermodynamics]]. At this temperature, matter contains no macroscopic thermal energy, but still has quantum-mechanical [[zero-point energy]] as predicted by the [[uncertainty principle]]. This does not enter into the definition of absolute temperature. Experimentally, absolute zero can only be approached very closely, but can never be actually reached. If it were possible to cool a system to absolute zero, all classical motion of its particles would cease and they would be at complete rest in this classical sense. The absolute zero, defined as {{val|0|u=K}}, is approximately equal to {{val|\u2212273.15|u=degC}}, or {{val|\u2212459.67|u=degF}}.\n\n===Absolute scales===\nReferring to the [[Boltzmann constant]], to the [[Maxwell\u2013Boltzmann distribution]], and to the Boltzmann [[Statistical mechanics|statistical mechanical definition]] of [[entropy]], as distinct from the Gibbs definition,<ref name=\"BoltzmannvsGibbs\">Jaynes, E.T. (1965), pp. 391\u2013398.</ref> for independently moving microscopic particles, disregarding interparticle potential energy,  by international agreement, a temperature scale is defined and said to be absolute because it is independent of the characteristics of particular thermometric substances and thermometer mechanisms. Apart from the absolute zero, it does not have a reference temperature. It is known as the [[Kelvin temperature scale|Kelvin scale]], widely used in science and technology. The kelvin (the word is spelled with a [[Letter case|lower-case]] k) is the unit of temperature in the [[International System of Units]] (SI). The temperature of a body in its own state of thermodynamic equilibrium is always positive, relative to the [[absolute zero]].\n\nBesides the internationally agreed Kelvin scale, there is also a [[Thermodynamic temperature|thermodynamic temperature scale]], invented by Kelvin, also with its numerical zero at the absolute zero of temperature, but directly relating to purely macroscopic [[thermodynamics|thermodynamic]] concepts, including the macroscopic [[entropy]], though microscopically referable to the Gibbs statistical mechanical definition of entropy for the [[canonical ensemble]], that takes interparticle potential energy into account, as well as independent particle motion, so that it can account for measurements of temperatures near absolute zero.<ref name=\"BoltzmannvsGibbs\"/> This scale has a reference temperature at the [[triple point]] of water, the numerical value of which is defined by measurements using the aforementioned internationally agreed Kelvin scale.\n\n===International Kelvin scale===\nMany scientific measurements use the Kelvin temperature scale (unit symbol: K), named in honor of the [[William Thomson, 1st Baron Kelvin|physicist who first defined it]]. It is an [[Absolute temperature|absolute]] scale. Its numerical zero point, {{val|0|u=K}}, is at the [[absolute zero]] of temperature. Since May, 2019, its degrees have been defined [[#Kinetic theory approach|through particle kinetic theory]], and statistical mechanics. In the [[International System of Units]] (SI), the magnitude of the kelvin is defined through various empirical measurements of the average kinetic energies of microscopic particles. It is numerically evaluated in terms of the [[Boltzmann constant]], the value of which is defined as fixed by international convention.<ref name=\"Boltzmann constant\">[https://cryogenicsociety.org/36995/news/nist_explains_the_new_kelvin_definition/ Cryogenic Society] (2019).</ref><ref name=\"draft-resolution-A\">{{citation|title=Draft Resolution A \"On the revision of the International System of units (SI)\" to be submitted to the CGPM at its 26th meeting (2018)|url=https://www.bipm.org/utils/en/pdf/CGPM/Draft-Resolution-A-EN.pdf}}</ref>\n\n===Statistical mechanical ''versus'' thermodynamic temperature scales===\nSince May 2019, the magnitude of the kelvin is defined in relation to microscopic phenomena, characterized in terms of statistical mechanics. Previously, since 1954, the International System of Units defined a scale and unit for the kelvin as a [[thermodynamic temperature]], by using the reliably reproducible temperature of the [[triple point]] of water as a second reference point, the first reference point being {{val|0|u=K}} at absolute zero.\n\nHistorically, the triple point temperature of water was defined as exactly 273.16 units of the measurement increment. Today it is an empirically measured quantity. The freezing point of water at sea-level atmospheric pressure occurs at approximately {{val|273.15|u=K}} = {{val|0|u=degC}}.\n\n==Classification of scales==\nThere is a variety of kinds of temperature scale. It may be convenient to classify them as empirically and theoretically based. Empirical temperature scales are historically older, while theoretically based scales arose in the middle of the nineteenth century.<ref name=\"Truesdell 1980\">Truesdell, C.A. (1980), Sections 11 B, 11H, pp. 306\u2013310, 320\u2013332.</ref><ref>Quinn, T.&nbsp;J. (1983).</ref>\n\n===Empirical scales===\nEmpirically based temperature scales rely directly on measurements of simple macroscopic physical properties of materials. For example, the length of a column of mercury, confined in a glass-walled capillary tube, is dependent largely on temperature, and is the basis of the very useful mercury-in-glass thermometer. Such scales are valid only within convenient ranges of temperature. For example, above the boiling point of mercury, a mercury-in-glass thermometer is impracticable. Most materials expand with temperature increase, but some materials, such as water, contract with temperature increase over some specific range, and then they are hardly useful as thermometric materials. A material is of no use as a thermometer near one of its phase-change temperatures, for example its boiling-point.\n\nIn spite of these limitations, most generally used practical thermometers are of the empirically based kind. Especially, it was used for [[calorimetry]], which contributed greatly to the discovery of thermodynamics. Nevertheless, empirical thermometry has serious drawbacks when judged as a basis for theoretical physics. Empirically based thermometers, beyond their base as simple direct measurements of ordinary physical properties of thermometric materials, can be re-calibrated, by use of theoretical physical reasoning, and this can extend their range of adequacy.\n\n===Theoretical scales===\nTheoretically-based temperature scales are based directly on theoretical arguments, especially those of kinetic theory and thermodynamics. They are more or less ideally realised in practically feasible physical devices and materials. Theoretically based temperature scales are used to provide calibrating standards for practical empirically based thermometers.\n\n====Microscopic statistical mechanical scale====\nIn physics, the internationally agreed conventional temperature scale is called the Kelvin scale. It is calibrated through the internationally agreed and prescribed value of the Boltzmann constant,<ref name=\"Boltzmann constant\"/><ref name=\"draft-resolution-A\"/> referring to motions of microscopic particles, such as atoms, molecules, and electrons, constituent in the body whose temperature is to be measured. In contrast with the thermodynamic temperature scale invented by Kelvin, the presently conventional Kelvin temperature is not defined through comparison with the temperature of a reference state of a standard body, nor in terms of macroscopic thermodynamics.\n\nApart from the absolute zero of temperature, Kelvin temperature of a body in a state of internal thermodynamic equilibrium is defined by measurements of suitably chosen of its physical properties, such as have precisely known theoretical explanations in terms of the [[Boltzmann constant]]. That constant refers to chosen kinds of motion of microscopic particles in the constitution of the body. In those kinds of motion, the particles move individually, without mutual interaction. Such motions are typically interrupted by inter-particle collisions, but for temperature measurement, the motions are chosen so that, between collisions, the non-interactive segments of their trajectories are known to be accessible to accurate measurement. For this purpose, interperticle potential energy is disregarded.\n\nIn an [[ideal gas]], and in other theoretically understood bodies, the Kelvin temperature is defined to be proportional to the average kinetic energy of non-interactively moving microscopic particles, which can be measured by suitable techniques. The proportionality constant is a simple multiple of the Boltzmann constant. If molecules, atoms, or electrons,<ref>Germer, L.H. (1925).

For a gas of known molecular character and pressure, this provides a relation between temperature and Boltzmann's constant. Those quantities can be known or measured more precisely than can the thermodynamic variables that define the state of a sample of water at its triple point. Consequently, taking the value of Boltzmann's constant as a primarily defined reference of exactly defined value, a measurement of the speed of sound can provide a more precise measurement of the temperature of the gas.<ref name=\"de Podesta\">de Podesta, M., Underwood, R., Sutton, G., Morantz, P, Harris, P, Mark, D.F., Stuart, F.M., Vargha, G., Machin, M.

That Carnot engine was to work between two temperatures, that of the body whose temperature was to be measured, and a reference, that of a body at the temperature of the triple point of water. Then the reference temperature, that of the triple point, was defined to be exactly {{val|273.16|u=K}}. Since May 2019, that value has not been fixed by definition, but is to be measured through microscopic phenomena, involving the Boltzmann constant, as described above. The microscopic statistical mechanical definition does not have a reference temperature.\n\n====Ideal gas====\nA material on which a macroscopically defined temperature scale may be based is the [[ideal gas]]. The pressure exerted by a fixed volume and mass of an ideal gas is directly proportional to its temperature. Some natural gases show so nearly ideal properties over suitable temperature ranges that they can be used for thermometry; this was important during the development of thermodynamics and is still of practical importance today.<ref>Quinn, T.J.

This is because the [[Ideal gas#Entropy|entropy of an ideal gas]] at its absolute zero of temperature is not a positive semi-definite quantity, which puts the gas in violation of the third law of thermodynamics. In contrast to real materials, the ideal gas does not liquefy or solidify, no matter how cold it is. Alternatively thinking, the ideal gas law, refers to the limit of infinitely high temperature and zero pressure; these conditions guarantee non-interactive motions of the constituent molecules.<ref>Adkins, C.J.

It explains macroscopic phenomena through the [[classical mechanics]] of the microscopic particles. The [[equipartition theorem]] of kinetic theory asserts that each classical [[Degrees of freedom (physics and chemistry)|degree of freedom]] of a freely moving particle has an average kinetic energy of {{math|''k''<sub>B</sub>''T''/2}} where {{math|''k''<sub>B</sub>}} denotes [[Boltzmann's constant]]. The translational motion of the particle has three degrees of freedom, so that, except at very low temperatures where quantum effects predominate, the average translational kinetic energy of a freely moving particle in a system with temperature {{math|''T''}} will be {{math|3''k''<sub>B</sub>''T''/2}}.\n\n[[Molecule]]s, such as oxygen (O<sub>2</sub>), have more [[Degrees of freedom (physics and chemistry)|degrees of freedom]] than single spherical atoms: they undergo rotational and vibrational motions as well as translations. Heating results in an increase in temperature due to an increase in the average translational kinetic energy of the molecules. Heating will also cause, through [[equipartition]]ing, the energy associated with vibrational and rotational modes to increase. Thus a [[diatomic]] gas will require more energy input to increase its temperature by a certain amount, i.e. it will have a greater [[heat capacity]] than a monatomic gas.\n\nAs noted above, the speed of sound in a gas can be calculated from the molecular character of the gas, from its temperature and pressure, and from the value of Boltzmann's constant. Taking the value of Boltzmann's constant as a primarily defined reference of exactly defined value, a measurement of the speed of sound can provide a more precise measurement of the temperature of the gas.<ref name=\"de Podesta\"/>\n\nIt is possible to measure the average kinetic energy of constituent microscopic particles if they are allowed to escape from the bulk of the system, through a small hole in the containing wall. The spectrum of velocities has to be measured, and the average calculated from that. It is not necessarily the case that the particles that escape and are measured have the same velocity distribution as the particles that remain in the bulk of the system, but sometimes a good sample is possible.\n\n==Thermodynamic approach==\nTemperature is one of the principal quantities in the study of [[thermodynamics]]. Formerly, the magnitude of the kelvin was defined in thermodynamic terms, but nowadays, as mentioned above, it is defined in terms of kinetic theory.\n\nThe thermodynamic temperature is said to be '''absolute''' for two reasons. One is that its formal character is independent of the properties of particular materials. The other reason is that its zero is, in a sense, absolute, in that it indicates absence of microscopic classical motion of the constituent particles of matter, so that they have a limiting specific heat of zero for zero temperature, according to the third law of thermodynamics. Nevertheless, a thermodynamic temperature does in fact have a definite numerical value that has been arbitrarily chosen by tradition and is dependent on the property of a particular materials; it is simply less arbitrary than relative \"degrees\" scales such as [[Celsius scale|Celsius]] and [[Fahrenheit scale|Fahrenheit]].  Being an absolute scale with one fixed point (zero), there is only one degree of freedom left to arbitrary choice, rather than two as in relative scales. For the Kelvin scale since May 2019, by international convention, the choice has been made to use knowledge of modes of operation of various thermometric devices, relying on microscopic kinetic theories about molecular motion. The numerical scale is settled by a conventional definition of the value of the [[Boltzmann constant]], which relates macroscopic temperature to average microscopic kinetic energy of particles such as molecules. To demonstrate that its numerical value is indeed arbitrary, it is useful to point out that an alternate, less widely used absolute temperature scale exists called the [[Rankine scale]], made to be aligned with the [[Fahrenheit scale]] as [[Kelvin scale|Kelvin]] is with [[Celsius scale|Celsius]].\n\nThe thermodynamic definition of temperature is due to Kelvin.\n\nIt is framed in terms of an idealized device called a [[Carnot engine]], imagined to run in a fictive continuous [[Carnot cycle|cycle of successive processes]] that traverse a cycle of states of its working body. The engine takes in a quantity of heat {{math|''Q''<sub>1</sub>}} from a hot reservoir and passes out a lesser quantity of heat {{math|''Q''<sub>2</sub>}} to a cold reservoir. The difference in energy is passed, as thermodynamic work, to a work reservoir, and is considered to be the output of the engine. The cycle is imagined to run so slowly that at each point of the cycle the working body is in a state of thermodynamic equilibrium. The successive processes the cycle are thus imagined to run reversibly with no entropy production. Then the quantity of entropy taken in from the hot reservoir when the working body is heated is equal to that passed to the cold reservoir when the working body is cooled. Then the absolute or thermodynamic temperatures, {{math|''T''<sub>1</sub>}} and {{math|''T''<sub>2</sub>}},  of the reservoirs are defined so that to be such that\n{{NumBlk|:|<math>T_1 / T_2 = - Q_1 / Q_2.</math>|1}}\n\nThe zeroth law of thermodynamics allows this definition to be used to measure the absolute or thermodynamic temperature of an arbitrary body of interest, by making the other heat reservoir have the same temperature as the body of interest.\n\nKelvin's original work postulating absolute temperature was published in 1848. It was based on the work of Carnot, before the formulation of the first law of thermodynamics. Carnot had no sound understanding of heat, and no specific concept of entropy. He wrote of 'caloric', and said that all the caloric that passed from the hot reservoir was passed into the cold reservoir. Kelvin wrote in his 1848 paper that his scale was absolute in the sense that it was defined \"independently of the properties of any particular kind of matter\". His definitive publication, which sets out the definition just stated, was printed in 1853, a paper read in 1851.<ref>[[William Thomson, 1st Baron Kelvin|Thomson, W.

It thus has the [[Dimensional analysis|dimensions]] of a [[ratio]] of two extensive variables. In thermodynamics, two bodies are often considered as connected by contact with a common wall, which has some specific permeability properties. Such specific permeability can be referred to a specific intensive variable. An example is a diathermic wall that is permeable only to heat; the intensive variable for this case is temperature. When the two bodies have been in contact for a very long time, and have settled to a permanent steady state, the relevant intensive variables are equal in the two bodies; for a diathermal wall, this statement is sometimes called the zeroth law of thermodynamics.<ref>Tisza, L.

For study by methods of classical irreversible thermodynamics, a body is usually spatially and temporally divided conceptually into 'cells' of small size.

On the other hand, it makes no sense to speak of the internal energy at a point, while when local thermodynamic equilibrium prevails, it makes good sense to speak of the temperature at a point. Consequently, temperature can vary from point to point in a medium that is not in global thermodynamic equilibrium, but in which there is local thermodynamic equilibrium.\n\nThus, when local thermodynamic equilibrium prevails in a body, temperature can be regarded as a spatially varying local property in that body, and this is because temperature is an intensive variable.\n\n==Basic theory==\n{{Conjugate variables (thermodynamics)}}Temperature is a measure of a [[Categories (Aristotle)#The Praedicamenta|quality]] of a state of a material.<ref>Bryan, G.H.

Nevertheless, any one given body and any one suitable empirical thermometer can still support notions of empirical, non-absolute, hotness and temperature, for a suitable range of processes. This is a matter for study in [[non-equilibrium thermodynamics]].\n\n===Bodies not in a steady state===\nWhen a body is not in a steady state, then the notion of temperature becomes even less safe than for a body in a steady state not in thermodynamic equilibrium. This is also a matter for study in [[non-equilibrium thermodynamics]].\n\n===Thermodynamic equilibrium axiomatics===\nFor axiomatic treatment of thermodynamic equilibrium, since the 1930s, it has become customary to refer to a [[zeroth law of thermodynamics]]. The customarily stated minimalist version of such a law postulates only that all bodies, which when thermally connected would be in thermal equilibrium, should be said to have the same temperature by definition, but by itself does not establish temperature as a quantity expressed as a real number on a scale. A more physically informative version of such a law views empirical temperature as a chart on a hotness manifold.<ref name=\"Mach 1900\"/><ref name=\"Pitteri 1984\"/><ref name=\"Serrin 1978\">Serrin, J.

Its natural, intrinsic origin or null point is [[absolute zero]] at which the entropy of any system is at a minimum. Although this is the lowest absolute temperature described by the model, the [[third law of thermodynamics]] postulates that absolute zero cannot be attained by any physical system.\n\n==Heat capacity==\n{{see also|Heat capacity|Calorimetry}}\nWhen an energy transfer to or from a body is only as heat, the state of the body changes. Depending on the surroundings and the walls separating them from the body, various changes are possible in the body. They include chemical reactions, increase of pressure, increase of temperature, and phase change. For each kind of change under specified conditions, the heat capacity is the ratio of the quantity of heat transferred to the magnitude of the change. For example, if the change is an increase in temperature at constant volume, with no phase change and no chemical change, then the temperature of the body rises and its pressure increases. The quantity of heat transferred, {{math|\u0394''Q''}}, divided by the observed temperature change, {{math|\u0394''T''}}, is the body's [[heat capacity]] at constant volume:\n: <math> C_V = \\frac{\\Delta Q}{\\Delta T}. </math>\nIf heat capacity is measured for a well defined [[amount of substance]], the [[specific heat]] is the measure of the heat required to increase the temperature of such a unit quantity by one unit of temperature. For example, to raise the temperature of water by one kelvin (equal to one degree Celsius) requires 4186 [[joules]] per [[kilogram]] (J/kg).\n\n==Measurement==\n[[File:Pakkanen.jpg|thumb|upright|A typical Celsius thermometer measures a winter day temperature of {{val|\u221217|u=degC}}]]\n{{See also|Timeline of temperature and pressure measurement technology|International Temperature Scale of 1990|Comparison of temperature scales}}\n[[Temperature measurement]] using modern scientific [[thermometer]]s and temperature scales goes back at least as far as the early 18th century, when [[Gabriel Fahrenheit]] adapted a thermometer (switching to [[mercury (element)|mercury]]) and a scale both developed by [[Ole R\u00f8mer|Ole Christensen R\u00f8mer]]. Fahrenheit's scale is still in use in the United States for non-scientific applications.\n\nTemperature is measured with [[thermometers]] that may be [[calibration|calibrated]] to a variety of [[Temperature conversion formulas|temperature scales]]. In most of the world (except for [[Belize]], [[Myanmar]], [[Liberia]] and the [[United States]]), the Celsius scale is used for most temperature measuring purposes. Most scientists measure temperature using the Celsius scale and thermodynamic temperature using the [[Kelvin]] scale, which is the Celsius scale offset so that its null point is {{val|0|u=K}} = {{val|\u2212273.15|u=degC}}, or [[absolute zero]]. Many engineering fields in the US, notably high-tech and US federal specifications (civil and military), also use the Kelvin and Celsius scales. Other engineering fields in the US also rely upon the [[Rankine scale]] (a shifted Fahrenheit scale) when working in thermodynamic-related disciplines such as [[combustion]].\n\n===Units===\nThe basic unit of temperature in the [[International System of Units]] (SI) is the [[Kelvin]]. It has the symbol K.\n\nFor everyday applications, it is often convenient to use the Celsius scale, in which {{val|0|u=degC}} corresponds very closely to the [[freezing point]] of water and {{val|100|u=degC}} is its [[boiling point]] at sea level. Because liquid droplets commonly exist in clouds at sub-zero temperatures, {{val|0|u=degC}} is better defined as the melting point of ice. In this scale a temperature difference of 1 degree Celsius is the same as a {{gaps|1|kelvin}} increment, but the scale is offset by the temperature at which ice melts ({{val|273.15|u=K}}).\n\nBy international agreement,<ref>[http://www1.bipm.org/en/si/si_brochure/chapter2/2-1/2-1-1/kelvin.html The kelvin in the SI Brochure] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070926215600/http://www1.bipm.org/en/si/si_brochure/chapter2/2-1/2-1-1/kelvin.html |date=2007-09-26 }}</ref> until May 2019, the Kelvin and Celsius scales were defined by two fixing points: [[absolute zero]] and the [[triple point]] of [[Vienna Standard Mean Ocean Water]], which is water specially prepared with a specified blend of hydrogen and oxygen isotopes. Absolute zero was defined as precisely {{val|0|u=K}} and {{val|\u2212273.15|u=degC}}. It is the temperature at which all classical translational motion of the particles comprising matter ceases and they are at complete rest in the classical model. Quantum-mechanically, however, zero-point motion remains and has an associated energy, the [[zero-point energy]].  Matter is in its [[ground state]],<ref>{{cite web\n |url         = http://www.calphad.com/absolute_zero.html\n |title       = Absolute Zero\n |publisher   = Calphad.com\n |accessdate  = 2010-09-16\n |url-status=live\n |archiveurl  = https://web.archive.org/web/20110708112153/http://www.calphad.com/absolute_zero.html\n |archivedate = 2011-07-08\n |df          =\n}}</ref> and contains no [[thermal energy]]. The triple point of water is defined as {{val|273.16|u=K}} and {{val|0.01|u=degC}}. This definition served the following purposes: it fixed the magnitude of the kelvin as being precisely 1 part in 273.16 parts of the difference between absolute zero and the triple point of water; it establishes that one kelvin has precisely the same magnitude as one degree on the Celsius scale; and it established the difference between the null points of these scales as being {{val|273.15|u=K}} ({{val|0|u=K}} = {{val|\u2212273.15|u=degC}} and {{val|273.16|u=K}} = {{val|0.01|u=degC}}). Since 2019, there has been a new definition based on the Boltzmann constant.<ref>[https://www.bipm.org/metrology/thermometry/units.html Definition agreed by the 26th General Conference on Weights and Measures (CGPM)] in November 2018, implemented 20 May 2019</ref> But the scales are scarcely changed.\n\nIn the United States, the Fahrenheit scale is widely used. On this scale the freezing point of water corresponds to {{val|32|u=degF}} and the boiling point to {{val|212|u=degF}}. The Rankine scale, still used in fields of chemical engineering in the US, is an absolute scale based on the Fahrenheit increment.\n\n====Conversion====\nThe following table shows the [[temperature conversion formulas]] for conversions to and from the Celsius scale.\n{{temperature|C}}\n\n====Plasma physics====\nThe field of [[plasma physics]] deals with phenomena of [[Electromagnetic radiation|electromagnetic]] nature that involve very high temperatures. It is customary to express temperature as energy in units of [[electronvolt]]s (eV) or kiloelectronvolts (keV). The energy, which has a different [[Dimensional analysis|dimension]] from temperature, is then calculated as the product of the [[Boltzmann constant]] and temperature, <math> E = k_B T</math>. Then, 1 eV corresponds to {{val|11605|u=K}}. In the study of [[QCD matter]] one routinely encounters temperatures of the order of a few hundred [[MeV]], equivalent to about {{val|e=12|u=K}}.\n\n==Theoretical foundation==\n{{see also|Thermodynamic temperature}}\nHistorically, there are several scientific approaches to the explanation of temperature: the classical thermodynamic description based on macroscopic empirical variables that can be measured in a laboratory; the [[kinetic theory of gases]] which relates the macroscopic description to the probability distribution of the energy of motion of gas particles; and a microscopic explanation based on [[statistical physics]] and [[quantum mechanics]]. In addition, rigorous and purely mathematical treatments have provided an axiomatic approach to classical thermodynamics and temperature.<ref name=caratheodory>{{cite journal\n|author=C. Caratheodory\n|title=Untersuchungen \u00fcber die Grundlagen der Thermodynamik\n|year=1909\n|journal=Mathematische Annalen\n|volume=67\n|pages=355\u2013386\n|doi=10.1007/BF01450409\n|issue=3\n}}</ref> Statistical physics provides a deeper understanding by describing the atomic behavior of matter, and derives macroscopic properties from statistical averages of microscopic states, including both classical and quantum states. In the fundamental physical description, using [[natural units]], temperature may be measured directly in units of energy. However, in the practical systems of measurement for science, technology, and commerce, such as the modern [[metric system]] of units, the macroscopic and the microscopic descriptions are interrelated by the [[Boltzmann constant]], a proportionality factor that scales temperature to the microscopic mean kinetic energy.\n\nThe microscopic description in [[statistical mechanics]] is based on a model that analyzes a system into its fundamental particles of matter or into a set of classical or [[quantum mechanics|quantum-mechanical]] oscillators and considers the system as a [[Statistical ensemble (mathematical physics)|statistical ensemble]] of [[State of matter|microstates]]. As a collection of classical material particles, temperature is a measure of the mean energy of motion, called [[kinetic energy]], of the particles, whether in solids, liquids, gases, or plasmas. The kinetic energy, a concept of [[classical mechanics]], is half the [[mass]] of a particle times its [[speed]] squared. In this mechanical interpretation of thermal motion, the kinetic energies of material particles may reside in the velocity of the particles of their translational or vibrational motion or in the inertia of their rotational modes. In monatomic [[perfect gas]]es and, approximately, in most gases, temperature is a measure of the mean particle kinetic energy. It also determines the probability distribution function of the energy. In condensed matter, and particularly in solids, this purely mechanical description is often less useful and the oscillator model provides a better description to account for quantum mechanical phenomena. Temperature determines the statistical occupation of the microstates of the ensemble. The microscopic definition of temperature is only meaningful in the [[thermodynamic limit]], meaning for large ensembles of states or particles, to fulfill the requirements of the statistical model.\n\nThe kinetic energy is also considered as a component of [[thermal energy]]. The thermal energy may be partitioned into independent components attributed to the [[Degrees of freedom (physics and chemistry)|degrees of freedom]] of the particles or to the modes of oscillators in a [[thermodynamic system]]. In general, the number of these degrees of freedom that are available for the [[equipartition theorem|equipartitioning]] of energy depends on the temperature, i.e. the energy region of the interactions under consideration. For solids, the thermal energy is associated primarily with the [[Atom vibrations|vibrations]] of its atoms or molecules about their equilibrium position. In an [[ideal gas|ideal monatomic gas]], the kinetic energy is found exclusively in the purely translational motions of the particles. In other systems, [[vibration]]al and [[rotation]]al motions also contribute degrees of freedom.\n\n===Kinetic theory of gases===\n[[File:Translational motion.gif|thumb|A theoretical understanding of temperature in an ideal gas can be obtained from the [[Kinetic theory of gases|Kinetic theory]].]]\n[[James Clerk Maxwell|Maxwell]] and [[Ludwig Boltzmann|Boltzmann]] developed a [[kinetic theory of gases|kinetic theory]] that yields a fundamental understanding of temperature in gases.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Swendsen|first=Robert|title=Statistical mechanics of colloids and Boltzmann's definition of entropy|journal=American Journal of Physics|date=March 2006|volume=74|issue=3|pages=187\u2013190|doi=10.1119/1.2174962|bibcode = 2006AmJPh..74..187S }}</ref>\nThis theory also explains the [[ideal gas]] law and the observed heat capacity of [[Monatomic gas|monatomic]]  (or [[Noble gas|'noble']]) gases.<ref>Balescu, R.

The ideal gas law states:<ref>[[Richard Feynman|Feynman]], R.P., Leighton, R.B., Sands, M. (1963).

The [[ideal gas law]] allows one to measure temperature on this [[absolute temperature|absolute]] scale using the [[gas thermometer]].  The temperature in kelvins can be defined as the pressure in pascals of one mole of gas in a container of one cubic meter, divided by the gas constant.\n\nAlthough it is not a particularly convenient device, the [[gas thermometer]] provides an essential theoretical basis by which all thermometers can be calibrated.  As a practical matter, it is not possible to use a gas thermometer to measure absolute zero temperature since the gases tend to condense into a liquid long before the temperature reaches zero. It is possible, however, to extrapolate to absolute zero by using the ideal gas law, as shown in the figure.\n\nThe kinetic theory assumes that pressure is caused by the force associated with individual atoms striking the walls, and that all energy is translational [[kinetic energy]].  Using a sophisticated symmetry argument,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://galileo.phys.virginia.edu/classes/252/kinetic_theory.html |title=Kinetic Theory |website=galileo.phys.virginia.edu |accessdate=27 January 2018 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170716052320/http://galileo.phys.virginia.edu/classes/252/kinetic_theory.html |archivedate=16 July 2017 |df=}}</ref> [[Ludwig Boltzmann|Boltzmann]] deduced what is now called the [[Maxwell\u2013Boltzmann distribution|Maxwell\u2013Boltzmann probability distribution]] function for the velocity of particles in an ideal gas.

Thus the ideal gas law states that [[internal energy]] is directly proportional to temperature.<ref name=atkins>{{cite book\n|title=Physical Chemistry\n|author=Peter Atkins, Julio de Paula\n|page=9\n|edition=8\n|publisher=Oxford University Press\n|year=2006\n}}</ref> This direct proportionality between temperature and [[internal energy]] is a special case of the [[Equipartition theorem#General formulation of the equipartition theorem|equipartition theorem]], and holds only in the [[classical physics|classical]] limit of an [[ideal gas]]. It does not hold for most substances, although it is true that temperature is a [[monotonic function|monotonic]] (non-decreasing) function of [[internal energy]].\n\n===Zeroth law of thermodynamics===\n{{main|Zeroth law of thermodynamics}}\n\nWhen two otherwise isolated bodies are connected together by a rigid physical path impermeable to matter, there is spontaneous transfer of energy as heat from the hotter to the colder of them. Eventually, they reach a state of mutual [[thermal equilibrium]], in which heat transfer has ceased, and the bodies' respective state variables have settled to become unchanging.\n\nOne statement of the [[zeroth law of thermodynamics]] is that if two systems are each in thermal equilibrium with a third system, then they are also in thermal equilibrium with each other.\n\nThis statement helps to define temperature but it does not, by itself, complete the definition. An empirical temperature is a numerical scale for the hotness of a thermodynamic system. Such hotness may be defined as existing on a [[Manifold#Motivational examples|one-dimensional manifold]], stretching between hot and cold. Sometimes the zeroth law is stated to include the existence of a unique universal hotness manifold, and of numerical scales on it, so as to provide a complete definition of empirical temperature.<ref name=\"Serrin 1978\"/> To be suitable for empirical thermometry, a material must have a monotonic relation between hotness and some easily measured state variable, such as pressure or volume, when all other relevant coordinates are fixed. An exceptionally suitable system is the [[ideal gas]], which can provide a temperature scale that matches the absolute Kelvin scale. The Kelvin scale is defined on the basis of the second law of thermodynamics.\n\n===Second law of thermodynamics===\n{{main|Second law of thermodynamics}}\nAs an alternative to considering or defining the zeroth law of thermodynamics, it was the historical development in thermodynamics to define temperature in terms of the [[second law of thermodynamics]] which deals with [[entropy]]. The second law states that any process will result in either no change or a net increase in the entropy of the universe. This can be understood in terms of probability.\n\nFor example, in a series of coin tosses, a perfectly ordered system would be one in which either every toss comes up heads or every toss comes up tails. This means the outcome is always 100% the same result. In contrast, many mixed (''disordered'') outcomes are possible, and their number increases with each toss. Eventually, the combinations of ~50% heads and ~50% tails dominate and obtaining an outcome significantly different from 50/50 becomes increasingly unlikely. Thus the system naturally progresses to a state of maximum disorder or entropy.\n\nAs temperature governs the transfer of heat between two systems and the universe tends to progress toward a maximum of entropy, it is expected that there is some relationship between temperature and entropy. A [[heat engine]] is a device for converting thermal energy into mechanical energy, resulting in the performance of work. and analysis of the [[Carnot heat engine]] provides the necessary relationships. The work from a heat engine corresponds to the difference between the heat put into the system at high temperature, ''q<sub>H</sub>'' and the heat extracted at the low temperature, ''q<sub>C</sub>''. The efficiency is the work divided by the heat input:\n\n{{NumBlk|:|<math>\\text{efficiency} = \\frac {w_{cy}}{q_H} = \\frac{q_H - q_C}{q_H} = 1 - \\frac{q_C}{q_H},</math>|4}}\n\nwhere ''w<sub>cy</sub>'' is the work done per cycle. The efficiency depends only on ''q<sub>C</sub>''/''q<sub>H</sub>''. Because ''q<sub>C</sub>'' and ''q<sub>H</sub>'' correspond to heat transfer at the temperatures ''T<sub>C</sub>'' and ''T<sub>H</sub>'' respectively, ''q<sub>C</sub>''/''q<sub>H</sub>'' should be some function of these temperatures:\n\n{{NumBlk|:|<math>\\frac{q_C}{q_H} = f(T_H,T_C).</math>|5}}\n\n[[Carnot's theorem (thermodynamics)|Carnot's theorem]] states that all reversible engines operating between the same heat reservoirs are equally efficient. Thus, a heat engine operating between ''T''<sub>1</sub> and ''T''<sub>3</sub> must have the same efficiency as one consisting of two cycles, one between ''T''<sub>1</sub> and ''T''<sub>2</sub>, and the second between ''T''<sub>2</sub> and ''T''<sub>3</sub>. This can only be the case if\n\n:<math>\nq_{13} = \\frac{q_1 q_2} {q_2 q_3},\n</math>\n\nwhich implies\n\n:<math>\nq_{13} = f(T_1,T_3) = f(T_1,T_2)f(T_2,T_3).\n</math>\n\nSince the first function is independent of ''T''<sub>2</sub>, this temperature must cancel on the right side, meaning ''f''(''T''<sub>1</sub>,''T''<sub>3</sub>) is of the form ''g''(''T''<sub>1</sub>)/''g''(''T''<sub>3</sub>) (i.e. ''f''(''T''<sub>1</sub>,''T''<sub>3</sub>) = ''f''(''T''<sub>1</sub>,''T''<sub>2</sub>)''f''(''T''<sub>2</sub>,''T''<sub>3</sub>) = ''g''(''T''<sub>1</sub>)/''g''(''T''<sub>2</sub>)\u00b7 ''g''(''T''<sub>2</sub>)/''g''(''T''<sub>3</sub>) = ''g''(''T''<sub>1</sub>)/''g''(''T''<sub>3</sub>)), where ''g'' is a function of a single temperature. A temperature scale can now be chosen with the property that\n\n{{NumBlk|:|<math>\\frac{q_C}{q_H} = \\frac{T_C}{T_H}.</math>|6}}\n\nSubstituting (6) back into (4) gives a relationship for the efficiency in terms of temperature:\n{{NumBlk|:|<math>\\text{efficiency} = 1 - \\frac{q_C}{q_H} = 1 - \\frac{T_C}{T_H}.</math>|7}}\n\nFor ''T<sub>C</sub>'' = 0 K the efficiency is 100% and that efficiency becomes greater than 100% below 0 K. Since an efficiency greater than 100% violates the first law of thermodynamics, this implies that 0 K is the minimum possible temperature. In fact the lowest temperature ever obtained in a macroscopic system was 20 nK, which was achieved in 1995 at NIST. Subtracting the right hand side of (5) from the middle portion and rearranging gives\n:<math>\n\\frac{q_H}{T_H} - \\frac{q_C}{T_C} = 0,\n</math>\n\nwhere the negative sign indicates heat ejected from the system. This relationship suggests the existence of a state function, ''S'', defined by\n\n{{NumBlk|:|<math>dS = \\frac{dq_\\text{rev}}{T},</math>|8}}\n\nwhere the subscript indicates a reversible process. The change of this state function around any cycle is zero, as is necessary for any state function.  This function corresponds to the entropy of the system, which was described previously. Rearranging (8) gives a formula for temperature in terms of fictive infinitesimal quasi-reversible elements of entropy and heat:\n\n{{NumBlk|:|<math>T = \\frac{dq_\\text{rev}}{dS}.</math>|9}}\n\nFor a system, where entropy ''S''(''E'') is a function of its energy ''E'', the temperature ''T'' is given by\n\n{{NumBlk|:|<math>T^{-1} = \\frac{d}{dE} S(E),</math>|10}}\n\ni.e. the reciprocal of the temperature is the rate of increase of entropy with respect to energy.\n\n===Definition from statistical mechanics===\n[[Statistical mechanics]] defines temperature based on a system's fundamental degrees of freedom.  Eq.(10) is the defining relation of temperature. Eq. (9) can be derived from the principles underlying the [[fundamental thermodynamic relation]].\n\n===Generalized temperature from single-particle statistics===\nIt is possible to extend the definition of temperature even to systems of few particles, like in a [[quantum dot]]. The generalized temperature is obtained by considering time ensembles instead of configuration-space ensembles given in statistical mechanics in the case of thermal and particle exchange between a small system of [[fermion]]s (''N'' even less than 10) with a single/double-occupancy system.

For example, [[dry ice]] has a sublimation temperature of {{val|\u221278.5|u=degC}} which is equivalent to {{val|\u2212109.3|u=degF}}. On the absolute kelvin scale this temperature is {{val|194.6|u=K}}. No body can be brought to exactly 0 K (the coldest possible temperature) by any finite practicable process; this is a consequence of the [[third law of thermodynamics]].\n\nThe international kinetic theory temperature of a body cannot take negative values. The thermodynamic temperature scale, however, is not so constrained. \n\nFor a body of matter, there can sometimes be conceptually defined, in terms of microscopic degrees of freedom, namely particle spins, a subsystem, with a temperature other than that of the whole body. When the body is in its own state of internal thermodynamic equilibrium, the temperatures of the whole body and of the subsystem must be the same. The two temperatures can differ when, by work through externally imposed force fields, energy can be transferred to and from the subsystem, separately from the rest of the body; then the whole body is not in its own state of internal thermodynamic equilibrium. There is an upper limit of energy such a spin subsystem can attain.\n\nConsidering the subsystem to be in a temporary state of virtual thermodynamic equilibrium, it is possible to obtain a [[negative temperature]] on the thermodynamic scale. Thermodynamic temperature is the inverse of the derivative of the subsystem's entropy with respect to its internal energy. As the subsystem's internal energy increases, the entropy increases for some range, but eventually attains a maximum value and then begins to decrease as the highest energy states begin to fill. At the point of maximum entropy, the temperature function shows the behavior of a [[Mathematical singularity|singularity]], because the slope of the entropy function decreases to zero and then turns negative. As the subsystem's entropy reaches its maximum, its thermodynamic temperature goes to positive infinity, switching to negative infinity as the slope turns negative. Such negative temperatures are hotter than any positive temperature. Over time, when the subsystem is exposed to the rest of the body, which has a positive temperature, energy is transferred as heat from the negative temperature subsystem to the positive temperature system.<ref>{{cite book\n|title=Thermal Physics\n|last=Kittel |first=Charles\n|authorlink=Charles Kittel\n|author2=Kroemer, Herbert |authorlink2=Herbert Kroemer\n|year=1980\n|edition=2nd\n|publisher=W.H.

It is the manifestation of [[thermal energy]], present in all matter, which is the source of the occurrence of [[heat]], a flow of energy, when a body is in contact with another that is colder.\n\nTemperature is [[measurement|measured]] with a [[thermometer]]. Thermometers are calibrated in various [[Conversion of units of temperature|temperature scales]] that historically have used various reference points and thermometric substances for definition. The most common scales are the [[Celsius|Celsius scale]] (formerly called ''centigrade''), denoted \u00b0C, the [[Fahrenheit|Fahrenheit scale]] (denoted \u00b0F), and the [[Kelvin|Kelvin scale]] (denoted K), the latter of which is predominantly used for scientific purposes by conventions of the [[International System of Units]] (SI). \n\nWhen a body has no macroscopic chemical reactions or flows of matter or energy, it is said to be in its own internal state of [[thermodynamic equilibrium]]. Its temperature is uniform in space and unchanging in time. The lowest theoretical temperature is [[absolute zero]], at which no more thermal energy can be extracted from a body. Experimentally, it can only be approached very closely, but not reached, which is recognized in the [[third law of thermodynamics]].\n\nTemperature is important in all fields of [[natural science]], including [[physics]], [[chemistry]], [[Earth science]], [[medicine]], and [[biology]], as well as most aspects of daily life.\n\n==Effects==\nMany physical processes are affected by temperature, such as:\n* the physical properties of materials including the [[Phases of matter|phase]] ([[solid]], [[liquid]], [[gas]]eous or [[Plasma (physics)|plasma]]), [[density]], [[solubility]], [[vapor pressure]], [[electrical conductivity]],\n* the rate and extent to which [[chemical reaction]]s occur,<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=UKkQAQAAMAAJ|title=Thermal discharges at nuclear power stations: their management and environmental impacts : a report prepared by a group of experts as the result of a panel meeting held in Vienna, 23\u201327 October 1972|last=Agency|first=International Atomic Energy|date=1974|publisher=International Atomic Energy Agency}}</ref>\n* the amount and properties of [[thermal radiation]] emitted from the surface of an object, and\n* the [[speed of sound]] which is a function of the square root of the absolute temperature.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=eVpITJfPxMEC&pg=PA34|title=The Art of Digital Audio|last=Watkinson|first=John|date=2001|publisher=Taylor & Francis|isbn=978-0-240-51587-8}}</ref>\n\n==Scales==\n{{see also|Scale of temperature}}\n{{more citations needed section|date=August 2012}}\n\nTemperature scales differ in two ways: the point chosen as zero degrees, and the magnitudes of incremental units or degrees on the scale.\n\n===Commonly used scales===\nThe [[Celsius]] scale (\u00b0C) is used for common temperature measurements in most of the world. It is an empirical scale that was developed by a historical progress, which led to its zero point {{val|0|u=degC}} being defined by the freezing point of water, and additional degrees defined so that {{val|100|u=degC}} was the boiling point of water, both at sea-level atmospheric pressure. Because of the 100-degree interval, it was called a centigrade scale.<ref>Middleton, W.E.K. (1966), pp. 89\u2013105.</ref> Since the standardization of the kelvin in the International System of Units, it has subsequently been redefined in terms of the equivalent fixing points on the Kelvin scale, and so that a temperature increment of one degree Celsius is the same as an increment of one kelvin, though they differ by an additive offset of approximately 273.15.\n\nThe United States commonly uses the [[Fahrenheit]] scale, on which water freezes at {{val|32|u=degF}} and boils at {{val|212|u=degF}} at sea-level atmospheric pressure.\n\n===Absolute zero===\nAt the [[absolute zero]] of temperature, no more energy can be removed from matter as heat, a fact expressed in the [[third law of thermodynamics]]. At this temperature, matter contains no macroscopic thermal energy, but still has quantum-mechanical [[zero-point energy]] as predicted by the [[uncertainty principle]]. This does not enter into the definition of absolute temperature. Experimentally, absolute zero can only be approached very closely, but can never be actually reached. If it were possible to cool a system to absolute zero, all classical motion of its particles would cease and they would be at complete rest in this classical sense. The absolute zero, defined as {{val|0|u=K}}, is approximately equal to {{val|\u2212273.15|u=degC}}, or {{val|\u2212459.67|u=degF}}.\n\n===Absolute scales===\nReferring to the [[Boltzmann constant]], to the [[Maxwell\u2013Boltzmann distribution]], and to the Boltzmann [[Statistical mechanics|statistical mechanical definition]] of [[entropy]], as distinct from the Gibbs definition,<ref name=\"BoltzmannvsGibbs\">Jaynes, E.T. (1965), pp. 391\u2013398.</ref> for independently moving microscopic particles, disregarding interparticle potential energy,  by international agreement, a temperature scale is defined and said to be absolute because it is independent of the characteristics of particular thermometric substances and thermometer mechanisms. Apart from the absolute zero, it does not have a reference temperature. It is known as the [[Kelvin temperature scale|Kelvin scale]], widely used in science and technology. The kelvin (the word is spelled with a [[Letter case|lower-case]] k) is the unit of temperature in the [[International System of Units]] (SI). The temperature of a body in its own state of thermodynamic equilibrium is always positive, relative to the [[absolute zero]].\n\nBesides the internationally agreed Kelvin scale, there is also a [[Thermodynamic temperature|thermodynamic temperature scale]], invented by Kelvin, also with its numerical zero at the absolute zero of temperature, but directly relating to purely macroscopic [[thermodynamics|thermodynamic]] concepts, including the macroscopic [[entropy]], though microscopically referable to the Gibbs statistical mechanical definition of entropy for the [[canonical ensemble]], that takes interparticle potential energy into account, as well as independent particle motion, so that it can account for measurements of temperatures near absolute zero.<ref name=\"BoltzmannvsGibbs\"/> This scale has a reference temperature at the [[triple point]] of water, the numerical value of which is defined by measurements using the aforementioned internationally agreed Kelvin scale.\n\n===International Kelvin scale===\nMany scientific measurements use the Kelvin temperature scale (unit symbol: K), named in honor of the [[William Thomson, 1st Baron Kelvin|physicist who first defined it]]. It is an [[Absolute temperature|absolute]] scale. Its numerical zero point, {{val|0|u=K}}, is at the [[absolute zero]] of temperature. Since May, 2019, its degrees have been defined [[#Kinetic theory approach|through particle kinetic theory]], and statistical mechanics. In the [[International System of Units]] (SI), the magnitude of the kelvin is defined through various empirical measurements of the average kinetic energies of microscopic particles. It is numerically evaluated in terms of the [[Boltzmann constant]], the value of which is defined as fixed by international convention.<ref name=\"Boltzmann constant\">[https://cryogenicsociety.org/36995/news/nist_explains_the_new_kelvin_definition/ Cryogenic Society] (2019).</ref><ref name=\"draft-resolution-A\">{{citation|title=Draft Resolution A \"On the revision of the International System of units (SI)\" to be submitted to the CGPM at its 26th meeting (2018)|url=https://www.bipm.org/utils/en/pdf/CGPM/Draft-Resolution-A-EN.pdf}}</ref>\n\n===Statistical mechanical ''versus'' thermodynamic temperature scales===\nSince May 2019, the magnitude of the kelvin is defined in relation to microscopic phenomena, characterized in terms of statistical mechanics. Previously, since 1954, the International System of Units defined a scale and unit for the kelvin as a [[thermodynamic temperature]], by using the reliably reproducible temperature of the [[triple point]] of water as a second reference point, the first reference point being {{val|0|u=K}} at absolute zero.\n\nHistorically, the triple point temperature of water was defined as exactly 273.16 units of the measurement increment. Today it is an empirically measured quantity. The freezing point of water at sea-level atmospheric pressure occurs at approximately {{val|273.15|u=K}} = {{val|0|u=degC}}.\n\n==Classification of scales==\nThere is a variety of kinds of temperature scale. It may be convenient to classify them as empirically and theoretically based. Empirical temperature scales are historically older, while theoretically based scales arose in the middle of the nineteenth century.<ref name=\"Truesdell 1980\">Truesdell, C.A. (1980), Sections 11 B, 11H, pp. 306\u2013310, 320\u2013332.</ref><ref>Quinn, T.&nbsp;J. (1983).</ref>\n\n===Empirical scales===\nEmpirically based temperature scales rely directly on measurements of simple macroscopic physical properties of materials. For example, the length of a column of mercury, confined in a glass-walled capillary tube, is dependent largely on temperature, and is the basis of the very useful mercury-in-glass thermometer. Such scales are valid only within convenient ranges of temperature. For example, above the boiling point of mercury, a mercury-in-glass thermometer is impracticable. Most materials expand with temperature increase, but some materials, such as water, contract with temperature increase over some specific range, and then they are hardly useful as thermometric materials. A material is of no use as a thermometer near one of its phase-change temperatures, for example its boiling-point.\n\nIn spite of these limitations, most generally used practical thermometers are of the empirically based kind. Especially, it was used for [[calorimetry]], which contributed greatly to the discovery of thermodynamics. Nevertheless, empirical thermometry has serious drawbacks when judged as a basis for theoretical physics. Empirically based thermometers, beyond their base as simple direct measurements of ordinary physical properties of thermometric materials, can be re-calibrated, by use of theoretical physical reasoning, and this can extend their range of adequacy.\n\n===Theoretical scales===\nTheoretically-based temperature scales are based directly on theoretical arguments, especially those of kinetic theory and thermodynamics. They are more or less ideally realised in practically feasible physical devices and materials. Theoretically based temperature scales are used to provide calibrating standards for practical empirically based thermometers.\n\n====Microscopic statistical mechanical scale====\nIn physics, the internationally agreed conventional temperature scale is called the Kelvin scale. It is calibrated through the internationally agreed and prescribed value of the Boltzmann constant,<ref name=\"Boltzmann constant\"/><ref name=\"draft-resolution-A\"/> referring to motions of microscopic particles, such as atoms, molecules, and electrons, constituent in the body whose temperature is to be measured. In contrast with the thermodynamic temperature scale invented by Kelvin, the presently conventional Kelvin temperature is not defined through comparison with the temperature of a reference state of a standard body, nor in terms of macroscopic thermodynamics.\n\nApart from the absolute zero of temperature, Kelvin temperature of a body in a state of internal thermodynamic equilibrium is defined by measurements of suitably chosen of its physical properties, such as have precisely known theoretical explanations in terms of the [[Boltzmann constant]]. That constant refers to chosen kinds of motion of microscopic particles in the constitution of the body. In those kinds of motion, the particles move individually, without mutual interaction. Such motions are typically interrupted by inter-particle collisions, but for temperature measurement, the motions are chosen so that, between collisions, the non-interactive segments of their trajectories are known to be accessible to accurate measurement. For this purpose, interperticle potential energy is disregarded.\n\nIn an [[ideal gas]], and in other theoretically understood bodies, the Kelvin temperature is defined to be proportional to the average kinetic energy of non-interactively moving microscopic particles, which can be measured by suitable techniques. The proportionality constant is a simple multiple of the Boltzmann constant. If molecules, atoms, or electrons,<ref>Germer, L.H. (1925).

For a gas of known molecular character and pressure, this provides a relation between temperature and Boltzmann's constant. Those quantities can be known or measured more precisely than can the thermodynamic variables that define the state of a sample of water at its triple point. Consequently, taking the value of Boltzmann's constant as a primarily defined reference of exactly defined value, a measurement of the speed of sound can provide a more precise measurement of the temperature of the gas.<ref name=\"de Podesta\">de Podesta, M., Underwood, R., Sutton, G., Morantz, P, Harris, P, Mark, D.F., Stuart, F.M., Vargha, G., Machin, M.

The resistor has two terminals and is in effect a one-dimensional body. The Bose-Einstein law for this case indicates that the noise-power is directly proportional to the temperature of the resistor and to the value of its resistance and to the noise band-width. In a given frequency band, the noise-power has equal contributions from every frequency and is called [[Johnson noise]]. If the value of the resistance is known then the temperature can be found.<ref>Quinn, T.J. (1983), pp. 98\u2013107.</ref><ref>Schooley, J.F. (1986), pp. 138\u2013143.</ref>\n\n====Macroscopic thermodynamic scale====\nHistorically, till May 2019, the definition of the Kelvin scale was that invented by Kelvin, based on a ratio of quantities of energy in processes in an ideal Carnot engine, entirely in terms of macroscopic thermodynamics. That Carnot engine was to work between two temperatures, that of the body whose temperature was to be measured, and a reference, that of a body at the temperature of the triple point of water. Then the reference temperature, that of the triple point, was defined to be exactly {{val|273.16|u=K}}. Since May 2019, that value has not been fixed by definition, but is to be measured through microscopic phenomena, involving the Boltzmann constant, as described above. The microscopic statistical mechanical definition does not have a reference temperature.\n\n====Ideal gas====\nA material on which a macroscopically defined temperature scale may be based is the [[ideal gas]]. The pressure exerted by a fixed volume and mass of an ideal gas is directly proportional to its temperature. Some natural gases show so nearly ideal properties over suitable temperature ranges that they can be used for thermometry; this was important during the development of thermodynamics and is still of practical importance today.<ref>Quinn, T.J. (1983), pp. 61\u201383.</ref><ref>Schooley, J.F. (1986), pp. 115\u2013138.</ref> The ideal gas thermometer is, however, not theoretically perfect for thermodynamics. This is because the [[Ideal gas#Entropy|entropy of an ideal gas]] at its absolute zero of temperature is not a positive semi-definite quantity, which puts the gas in violation of the third law of thermodynamics. In contrast to real materials, the ideal gas does not liquefy or solidify, no matter how cold it is. Alternatively thinking, the ideal gas law, refers to the limit of infinitely high temperature and zero pressure; these conditions guarantee non-interactive motions of the constituent molecules.<ref>Adkins, C.J.

(2000), p.&nbsp;88.</ref>\n\n==Kinetic theory approach==\nThe magnitude of the kelvin is now defined in terms of kinetic theory, derived from the value of [[Boltzmann's constant]].\n\n[[Kinetic theory of gases|Kinetic theory]] provides a microscopic account of temperature for some bodies of material, especially gases, based on macroscopic systems' being composed of many microscopic particles, such as [[molecule]]s and [[ion]]s of various species, the particles of a species being all alike. It explains macroscopic phenomena through the [[classical mechanics]] of the microscopic particles. The [[equipartition theorem]] of kinetic theory asserts that each classical [[Degrees of freedom (physics and chemistry)|degree of freedom]] of a freely moving particle has an average kinetic energy of {{math|''k''<sub>B</sub>''T''/2}} where {{math|''k''<sub>B</sub>}} denotes [[Boltzmann's constant]]. The translational motion of the particle has three degrees of freedom, so that, except at very low temperatures where quantum effects predominate, the average translational kinetic energy of a freely moving particle in a system with temperature {{math|''T''}} will be {{math|3''k''<sub>B</sub>''T''/2}}.\n\n[[Molecule]]s, such as oxygen (O<sub>2</sub>), have more [[Degrees of freedom (physics and chemistry)|degrees of freedom]] than single spherical atoms: they undergo rotational and vibrational motions as well as translations. Heating results in an increase in temperature due to an increase in the average translational kinetic energy of the molecules. Heating will also cause, through [[equipartition]]ing, the energy associated with vibrational and rotational modes to increase. Thus a [[diatomic]] gas will require more energy input to increase its temperature by a certain amount, i.e. it will have a greater [[heat capacity]] than a monatomic gas.\n\nAs noted above, the speed of sound in a gas can be calculated from the molecular character of the gas, from its temperature and pressure, and from the value of Boltzmann's constant. Taking the value of Boltzmann's constant as a primarily defined reference of exactly defined value, a measurement of the speed of sound can provide a more precise measurement of the temperature of the gas.<ref name=\"de Podesta\"/>\n\nIt is possible to measure the average kinetic energy of constituent microscopic particles if they are allowed to escape from the bulk of the system, through a small hole in the containing wall. The spectrum of velocities has to be measured, and the average calculated from that. It is not necessarily the case that the particles that escape and are measured have the same velocity distribution as the particles that remain in the bulk of the system, but sometimes a good sample is possible.\n\n==Thermodynamic approach==\nTemperature is one of the principal quantities in the study of [[thermodynamics]]. Formerly, the magnitude of the kelvin was defined in thermodynamic terms, but nowadays, as mentioned above, it is defined in terms of kinetic theory.\n\nThe thermodynamic temperature is said to be '''absolute''' for two reasons. One is that its formal character is independent of the properties of particular materials. The other reason is that its zero is, in a sense, absolute, in that it indicates absence of microscopic classical motion of the constituent particles of matter, so that they have a limiting specific heat of zero for zero temperature, according to the third law of thermodynamics. Nevertheless, a thermodynamic temperature does in fact have a definite numerical value that has been arbitrarily chosen by tradition and is dependent on the property of a particular materials; it is simply less arbitrary than relative \"degrees\" scales such as [[Celsius scale|Celsius]] and [[Fahrenheit scale|Fahrenheit]].  Being an absolute scale with one fixed point (zero), there is only one degree of freedom left to arbitrary choice, rather than two as in relative scales. For the Kelvin scale since May 2019, by international convention, the choice has been made to use knowledge of modes of operation of various thermometric devices, relying on microscopic kinetic theories about molecular motion. The numerical scale is settled by a conventional definition of the value of the [[Boltzmann constant]], which relates macroscopic temperature to average microscopic kinetic energy of particles such as molecules. To demonstrate that its numerical value is indeed arbitrary, it is useful to point out that an alternate, less widely used absolute temperature scale exists called the [[Rankine scale]], made to be aligned with the [[Fahrenheit scale]] as [[Kelvin scale|Kelvin]] is with [[Celsius scale|Celsius]].\n\nThe thermodynamic definition of temperature is due to Kelvin.\n\nIt is framed in terms of an idealized device called a [[Carnot engine]], imagined to run in a fictive continuous [[Carnot cycle|cycle of successive processes]] that traverse a cycle of states of its working body. The engine takes in a quantity of heat {{math|''Q''<sub>1</sub>}} from a hot reservoir and passes out a lesser quantity of heat {{math|''Q''<sub>2</sub>}} to a cold reservoir. The difference in energy is passed, as thermodynamic work, to a work reservoir, and is considered to be the output of the engine. The cycle is imagined to run so slowly that at each point of the cycle the working body is in a state of thermodynamic equilibrium. The successive processes the cycle are thus imagined to run reversibly with no entropy production. Then the quantity of entropy taken in from the hot reservoir when the working body is heated is equal to that passed to the cold reservoir when the working body is cooled. Then the absolute or thermodynamic temperatures, {{math|''T''<sub>1</sub>}} and {{math|''T''<sub>2</sub>}},  of the reservoirs are defined so that to be such that\n{{NumBlk|:|<math>T_1 / T_2 = - Q_1 / Q_2.</math>|1}}\n\nThe zeroth law of thermodynamics allows this definition to be used to measure the absolute or thermodynamic temperature of an arbitrary body of interest, by making the other heat reservoir have the same temperature as the body of interest.\n\nKelvin's original work postulating absolute temperature was published in 1848. It was based on the work of Carnot, before the formulation of the first law of thermodynamics. Carnot had no sound understanding of heat, and no specific concept of entropy. He wrote of 'caloric', and said that all the caloric that passed from the hot reservoir was passed into the cold reservoir. Kelvin wrote in his 1848 paper that his scale was absolute in the sense that it was defined \"independently of the properties of any particular kind of matter\". His definitive publication, which sets out the definition just stated, was printed in 1853, a paper read in 1851.<ref>[[William Thomson, 1st Baron Kelvin|Thomson, W.

''Temperature'', Academic Press, London, {{ISBN|0-12-569680-9}}, pp. 160\u2013162.</ref> Nowadays, the numerical value is instead obtained from measurement through the microscopic statistical mechanical international definition, as above.\n\n===Intensive variability===\nIn thermodynamic terms, temperature is an [[Intensive and extensive properties|intensive variable]] because it is equal to a [[differential coefficient]] of one [[Intensive and extensive properties|extensive variable]] with respect to another, for a given body. It thus has the [[Dimensional analysis|dimensions]] of a [[ratio]] of two extensive variables. In thermodynamics, two bodies are often considered as connected by contact with a common wall, which has some specific permeability properties. Such specific permeability can be referred to a specific intensive variable. An example is a diathermic wall that is permeable only to heat; the intensive variable for this case is temperature. When the two bodies have been in contact for a very long time, and have settled to a permanent steady state, the relevant intensive variables are equal in the two bodies; for a diathermal wall, this statement is sometimes called the zeroth law of thermodynamics.<ref>Tisza, L.

For study by methods of classical irreversible thermodynamics, a body is usually spatially and temporally divided conceptually into 'cells' of small size. If classical thermodynamic equilibrium conditions for matter are fulfilled to good approximation in such a 'cell', then it is homogeneous and a temperature exists for it. If this is so for every 'cell' of the body, then [[Thermodynamic equilibrium#Local and global equilibrium|local thermodynamic equilibrium]] is said to prevail throughout the body.<ref>[[Edward Arthur Milne|Milne, E.A.]] (1929).

It can then well be that different empirical thermometers disagree about which is the hotter, and if this is so, then at least one of the bodies does not have a well defined absolute thermodynamic temperature. Nevertheless, any one given body and any one suitable empirical thermometer can still support notions of empirical, non-absolute, hotness and temperature, for a suitable range of processes. This is a matter for study in [[non-equilibrium thermodynamics]].\n\n===Bodies not in a steady state===\nWhen a body is not in a steady state, then the notion of temperature becomes even less safe than for a body in a steady state not in thermodynamic equilibrium. This is also a matter for study in [[non-equilibrium thermodynamics]].\n\n===Thermodynamic equilibrium axiomatics===\nFor axiomatic treatment of thermodynamic equilibrium, since the 1930s, it has become customary to refer to a [[zeroth law of thermodynamics]]. The customarily stated minimalist version of such a law postulates only that all bodies, which when thermally connected would be in thermal equilibrium, should be said to have the same temperature by definition, but by itself does not establish temperature as a quantity expressed as a real number on a scale. A more physically informative version of such a law views empirical temperature as a chart on a hotness manifold.<ref name=\"Mach 1900\"/><ref name=\"Pitteri 1984\"/><ref name=\"Serrin 1978\">Serrin, J.

Its natural, intrinsic origin or null point is [[absolute zero]] at which the entropy of any system is at a minimum. Although this is the lowest absolute temperature described by the model, the [[third law of thermodynamics]] postulates that absolute zero cannot be attained by any physical system.\n\n==Heat capacity==\n{{see also|Heat capacity|Calorimetry}}\nWhen an energy transfer to or from a body is only as heat, the state of the body changes. Depending on the surroundings and the walls separating them from the body, various changes are possible in the body. They include chemical reactions, increase of pressure, increase of temperature, and phase change. For each kind of change under specified conditions, the heat capacity is the ratio of the quantity of heat transferred to the magnitude of the change. For example, if the change is an increase in temperature at constant volume, with no phase change and no chemical change, then the temperature of the body rises and its pressure increases. The quantity of heat transferred, {{math|\u0394''Q''}}, divided by the observed temperature change, {{math|\u0394''T''}}, is the body's [[heat capacity]] at constant volume:\n: <math> C_V = \\frac{\\Delta Q}{\\Delta T}. </math>\nIf heat capacity is measured for a well defined [[amount of substance]], the [[specific heat]] is the measure of the heat required to increase the temperature of such a unit quantity by one unit of temperature. For example, to raise the temperature of water by one kelvin (equal to one degree Celsius) requires 4186 [[joules]] per [[kilogram]] (J/kg).\n\n==Measurement==\n[[File:Pakkanen.jpg|thumb|upright|A typical Celsius thermometer measures a winter day temperature of {{val|\u221217|u=degC}}]]\n{{See also|Timeline of temperature and pressure measurement technology|International Temperature Scale of 1990|Comparison of temperature scales}}\n[[Temperature measurement]] using modern scientific [[thermometer]]s and temperature scales goes back at least as far as the early 18th century, when [[Gabriel Fahrenheit]] adapted a thermometer (switching to [[mercury (element)|mercury]]) and a scale both developed by [[Ole R\u00f8mer|Ole Christensen R\u00f8mer]]. Fahrenheit's scale is still in use in the United States for non-scientific applications.\n\nTemperature is measured with [[thermometers]] that may be [[calibration|calibrated]] to a variety of [[Temperature conversion formulas|temperature scales]]. In most of the world (except for [[Belize]], [[Myanmar]], [[Liberia]] and the [[United States]]), the Celsius scale is used for most temperature measuring purposes. Most scientists measure temperature using the Celsius scale and thermodynamic temperature using the [[Kelvin]] scale, which is the Celsius scale offset so that its null point is {{val|0|u=K}} = {{val|\u2212273.15|u=degC}}, or [[absolute zero]]. Many engineering fields in the US, notably high-tech and US federal specifications (civil and military), also use the Kelvin and Celsius scales. Other engineering fields in the US also rely upon the [[Rankine scale]] (a shifted Fahrenheit scale) when working in thermodynamic-related disciplines such as [[combustion]].\n\n===Units===\nThe basic unit of temperature in the [[International System of Units]] (SI) is the [[Kelvin]]. It has the symbol K.\n\nFor everyday applications, it is often convenient to use the Celsius scale, in which {{val|0|u=degC}} corresponds very closely to the [[freezing point]] of water and {{val|100|u=degC}} is its [[boiling point]] at sea level. Because liquid droplets commonly exist in clouds at sub-zero temperatures, {{val|0|u=degC}} is better defined as the melting point of ice. In this scale a temperature difference of 1 degree Celsius is the same as a {{gaps|1|kelvin}} increment, but the scale is offset by the temperature at which ice melts ({{val|273.15|u=K}}).\n\nBy international agreement,<ref>[http://www1.bipm.org/en/si/si_brochure/chapter2/2-1/2-1-1/kelvin.html The kelvin in the SI Brochure] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070926215600/http://www1.bipm.org/en/si/si_brochure/chapter2/2-1/2-1-1/kelvin.html |date=2007-09-26 }}</ref> until May 2019, the Kelvin and Celsius scales were defined by two fixing points: [[absolute zero]] and the [[triple point]] of [[Vienna Standard Mean Ocean Water]], which is water specially prepared with a specified blend of hydrogen and oxygen isotopes. Absolute zero was defined as precisely {{val|0|u=K}} and {{val|\u2212273.15|u=degC}}. It is the temperature at which all classical translational motion of the particles comprising matter ceases and they are at complete rest in the classical model. Quantum-mechanically, however, zero-point motion remains and has an associated energy, the [[zero-point energy]].  Matter is in its [[ground state]],<ref>{{cite web\n |url         = http://www.calphad.com/absolute_zero.html\n |title       = Absolute Zero\n |publisher   = Calphad.com\n |accessdate  = 2010-09-16\n |url-status=live\n |archiveurl  = https://web.archive.org/web/20110708112153/http://www.calphad.com/absolute_zero.html\n |archivedate = 2011-07-08\n |df          =\n}}</ref> and contains no [[thermal energy]]. The triple point of water is defined as {{val|273.16|u=K}} and {{val|0.01|u=degC}}. This definition served the following purposes: it fixed the magnitude of the kelvin as being precisely 1 part in 273.16 parts of the difference between absolute zero and the triple point of water; it establishes that one kelvin has precisely the same magnitude as one degree on the Celsius scale; and it established the difference between the null points of these scales as being {{val|273.15|u=K}} ({{val|0|u=K}} = {{val|\u2212273.15|u=degC}} and {{val|273.16|u=K}} = {{val|0.01|u=degC}}). Since 2019, there has been a new definition based on the Boltzmann constant.<ref>[https://www.bipm.org/metrology/thermometry/units.html Definition agreed by the 26th General Conference on Weights and Measures (CGPM)] in November 2018, implemented 20 May 2019</ref> But the scales are scarcely changed.\n\nIn the United States, the Fahrenheit scale is widely used. On this scale the freezing point of water corresponds to {{val|32|u=degF}} and the boiling point to {{val|212|u=degF}}. The Rankine scale, still used in fields of chemical engineering in the US, is an absolute scale based on the Fahrenheit increment.\n\n====Conversion====\nThe following table shows the [[temperature conversion formulas]] for conversions to and from the Celsius scale.\n{{temperature|C}}\n\n====Plasma physics====\nThe field of [[plasma physics]] deals with phenomena of [[Electromagnetic radiation|electromagnetic]] nature that involve very high temperatures. It is customary to express temperature as energy in units of [[electronvolt]]s (eV) or kiloelectronvolts (keV). The energy, which has a different [[Dimensional analysis|dimension]] from temperature, is then calculated as the product of the [[Boltzmann constant]] and temperature, <math> E = k_B T</math>. Then, 1 eV corresponds to {{val|11605|u=K}}. In the study of [[QCD matter]] one routinely encounters temperatures of the order of a few hundred [[MeV]], equivalent to about {{val|e=12|u=K}}.\n\n==Theoretical foundation==\n{{see also|Thermodynamic temperature}}\nHistorically, there are several scientific approaches to the explanation of temperature: the classical thermodynamic description based on macroscopic empirical variables that can be measured in a laboratory; the [[kinetic theory of gases]] which relates the macroscopic description to the probability distribution of the energy of motion of gas particles; and a microscopic explanation based on [[statistical physics]] and [[quantum mechanics]]. In addition, rigorous and purely mathematical treatments have provided an axiomatic approach to classical thermodynamics and temperature.<ref name=caratheodory>{{cite journal\n|author=C. Caratheodory\n|title=Untersuchungen \u00fcber die Grundlagen der Thermodynamik\n|year=1909\n|journal=Mathematische Annalen\n|volume=67\n|pages=355\u2013386\n|doi=10.1007/BF01450409\n|issue=3\n}}</ref> Statistical physics provides a deeper understanding by describing the atomic behavior of matter, and derives macroscopic properties from statistical averages of microscopic states, including both classical and quantum states. In the fundamental physical description, using [[natural units]], temperature may be measured directly in units of energy. However, in the practical systems of measurement for science, technology, and commerce, such as the modern [[metric system]] of units, the macroscopic and the microscopic descriptions are interrelated by the [[Boltzmann constant]], a proportionality factor that scales temperature to the microscopic mean kinetic energy.\n\nThe microscopic description in [[statistical mechanics]] is based on a model that analyzes a system into its fundamental particles of matter or into a set of classical or [[quantum mechanics|quantum-mechanical]] oscillators and considers the system as a [[Statistical ensemble (mathematical physics)|statistical ensemble]] of [[State of matter|microstates]]. As a collection of classical material particles, temperature is a measure of the mean energy of motion, called [[kinetic energy]], of the particles, whether in solids, liquids, gases, or plasmas. The kinetic energy, a concept of [[classical mechanics]], is half the [[mass]] of a particle times its [[speed]] squared. In this mechanical interpretation of thermal motion, the kinetic energies of material particles may reside in the velocity of the particles of their translational or vibrational motion or in the inertia of their rotational modes. In monatomic [[perfect gas]]es and, approximately, in most gases, temperature is a measure of the mean particle kinetic energy. It also determines the probability distribution function of the energy. In condensed matter, and particularly in solids, this purely mechanical description is often less useful and the oscillator model provides a better description to account for quantum mechanical phenomena. Temperature determines the statistical occupation of the microstates of the ensemble. The microscopic definition of temperature is only meaningful in the [[thermodynamic limit]], meaning for large ensembles of states or particles, to fulfill the requirements of the statistical model.\n\nThe kinetic energy is also considered as a component of [[thermal energy]]. The thermal energy may be partitioned into independent components attributed to the [[Degrees of freedom (physics and chemistry)|degrees of freedom]] of the particles or to the modes of oscillators in a [[thermodynamic system]]. In general, the number of these degrees of freedom that are available for the [[equipartition theorem|equipartitioning]] of energy depends on the temperature, i.e. the energy region of the interactions under consideration. For solids, the thermal energy is associated primarily with the [[Atom vibrations|vibrations]] of its atoms or molecules about their equilibrium position. In an [[ideal gas|ideal monatomic gas]], the kinetic energy is found exclusively in the purely translational motions of the particles.

The ideal gas law states:<ref>[[Richard Feynman|Feynman]], R.P., Leighton, R.B., Sands, M. (1963).

The [[ideal gas law]] allows one to measure temperature on this [[absolute temperature|absolute]] scale using the [[gas thermometer]].  The temperature in kelvins can be defined as the pressure in pascals of one mole of gas in a container of one cubic meter, divided by the gas constant.\n\nAlthough it is not a particularly convenient device, the [[gas thermometer]] provides an essential theoretical basis by which all thermometers can be calibrated.  As a practical matter, it is not possible to use a gas thermometer to measure absolute zero temperature since the gases tend to condense into a liquid long before the temperature reaches zero. It is possible, however, to extrapolate to absolute zero by using the ideal gas law, as shown in the figure.\n\nThe kinetic theory assumes that pressure is caused by the force associated with individual atoms striking the walls, and that all energy is translational [[kinetic energy]].  Using a sophisticated symmetry argument,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://galileo.phys.virginia.edu/classes/252/kinetic_theory.html |title=Kinetic Theory |website=galileo.phys.virginia.edu |accessdate=27 January 2018 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170716052320/http://galileo.phys.virginia.edu/classes/252/kinetic_theory.html |archivedate=16 July 2017 |df=}}</ref> [[Ludwig Boltzmann|Boltzmann]] deduced what is now called the [[Maxwell\u2013Boltzmann distribution|Maxwell\u2013Boltzmann probability distribution]] function for the velocity of particles in an ideal gas.

Thus the ideal gas law states that [[internal energy]] is directly proportional to temperature.<ref name=atkins>{{cite book\n|title=Physical Chemistry\n|author=Peter Atkins, Julio de Paula\n|page=9\n|edition=8\n|publisher=Oxford University Press\n|year=2006\n}}</ref> This direct proportionality between temperature and [[internal energy]] is a special case of the [[Equipartition theorem#General formulation of the equipartition theorem|equipartition theorem]], and holds only in the [[classical physics|classical]] limit of an [[ideal gas]]. It does not hold for most substances, although it is true that temperature is a [[monotonic function|monotonic]] (non-decreasing) function of [[internal energy]].\n\n===Zeroth law of thermodynamics===\n{{main|Zeroth law of thermodynamics}}\n\nWhen two otherwise isolated bodies are connected together by a rigid physical path impermeable to matter, there is spontaneous transfer of energy as heat from the hotter to the colder of them. Eventually, they reach a state of mutual [[thermal equilibrium]], in which heat transfer has ceased, and the bodies' respective state variables have settled to become unchanging.\n\nOne statement of the [[zeroth law of thermodynamics]] is that if two systems are each in thermal equilibrium with a third system, then they are also in thermal equilibrium with each other.\n\nThis statement helps to define temperature but it does not, by itself, complete the definition. An empirical temperature is a numerical scale for the hotness of a thermodynamic system. Such hotness may be defined as existing on a [[Manifold#Motivational examples|one-dimensional manifold]], stretching between hot and cold. Sometimes the zeroth law is stated to include the existence of a unique universal hotness manifold, and of numerical scales on it, so as to provide a complete definition of empirical temperature.<ref name=\"Serrin 1978\"/> To be suitable for empirical thermometry, a material must have a monotonic relation between hotness and some easily measured state variable, such as pressure or volume, when all other relevant coordinates are fixed. An exceptionally suitable system is the [[ideal gas]], which can provide a temperature scale that matches the absolute Kelvin scale. The Kelvin scale is defined on the basis of the second law of thermodynamics.\n\n===Second law of thermodynamics===\n{{main|Second law of thermodynamics}}\nAs an alternative to considering or defining the zeroth law of thermodynamics, it was the historical development in thermodynamics to define temperature in terms of the [[second law of thermodynamics]] which deals with [[entropy]]. The second law states that any process will result in either no change or a net increase in the entropy of the universe. This can be understood in terms of probability.\n\nFor example, in a series of coin tosses, a perfectly ordered system would be one in which either every toss comes up heads or every toss comes up tails. This means the outcome is always 100% the same result. In contrast, many mixed (''disordered'') outcomes are possible, and their number increases with each toss. Eventually, the combinations of ~50% heads and ~50% tails dominate and obtaining an outcome significantly different from 50/50 becomes increasingly unlikely. Thus the system naturally progresses to a state of maximum disorder or entropy.\n\nAs temperature governs the transfer of heat between two systems and the universe tends to progress toward a maximum of entropy, it is expected that there is some relationship between temperature and entropy. A [[heat engine]] is a device for converting thermal energy into mechanical energy, resulting in the performance of work. and analysis of the [[Carnot heat engine]] provides the necessary relationships. The work from a heat engine corresponds to the difference between the heat put into the system at high temperature, ''q<sub>H</sub>'' and the heat extracted at the low temperature, ''q<sub>C</sub>''. The efficiency is the work divided by the heat input:\n\n{{NumBlk|:|<math>\\text{efficiency} = \\frac {w_{cy}}{q_H} = \\frac{q_H - q_C}{q_H} = 1 - \\frac{q_C}{q_H},</math>|4}}\n\nwhere ''w<sub>cy</sub>'' is the work done per cycle. The efficiency depends only on ''q<sub>C</sub>''/''q<sub>H</sub>''. Because ''q<sub>C</sub>'' and ''q<sub>H</sub>'' correspond to heat transfer at the temperatures ''T<sub>C</sub>'' and ''T<sub>H</sub>'' respectively, ''q<sub>C</sub>''/''q<sub>H</sub>'' should be some function of these temperatures:\n\n{{NumBlk|:|<math>\\frac{q_C}{q_H} = f(T_H,T_C).</math>|5}}\n\n[[Carnot's theorem (thermodynamics)|Carnot's theorem]] states that all reversible engines operating between the same heat reservoirs are equally efficient. Thus, a heat engine operating between ''T''<sub>1</sub> and ''T''<sub>3</sub> must have the same efficiency as one consisting of two cycles, one between ''T''<sub>1</sub> and ''T''<sub>2</sub>, and the second between ''T''<sub>2</sub> and ''T''<sub>3</sub>. This can only be the case if\n\n:<math>\nq_{13} = \\frac{q_1 q_2} {q_2 q_3},\n</math>\n\nwhich implies\n\n:<math>\nq_{13} = f(T_1,T_3) = f(T_1,T_2)f(T_2,T_3).\n</math>\n\nSince the first function is independent of ''T''<sub>2</sub>, this temperature must cancel on the right side, meaning ''f''(''T''<sub>1</sub>,''T''<sub>3</sub>) is of the form ''g''(''T''<sub>1</sub>)/''g''(''T''<sub>3</sub>) (i.e. ''f''(''T''<sub>1</sub>,''T''<sub>3</sub>) = ''f''(''T''<sub>1</sub>,''T''<sub>2</sub>)''f''(''T''<sub>2</sub>,''T''<sub>3</sub>) = ''g''(''T''<sub>1</sub>)/''g''(''T''<sub>2</sub>)\u00b7 ''g''(''T''<sub>2</sub>)/''g''(''T''<sub>3</sub>) = ''g''(''T''<sub>1</sub>)/''g''(''T''<sub>3</sub>)), where ''g'' is a function of a single temperature. A temperature scale can now be chosen with the property that\n\n{{NumBlk|:|<math>\\frac{q_C}{q_H} = \\frac{T_C}{T_H}.</math>|6}}\n\nSubstituting (6) back into (4) gives a relationship for the efficiency in terms of temperature:\n{{NumBlk|:|<math>\\text{efficiency} = 1 - \\frac{q_C}{q_H} = 1 - \\frac{T_C}{T_H}.</math>|7}}\n\nFor ''T<sub>C</sub>'' = 0 K the efficiency is 100% and that efficiency becomes greater than 100% below 0 K. Since an efficiency greater than 100% violates the first law of thermodynamics, this implies that 0 K is the minimum possible temperature. In fact the lowest temperature ever obtained in a macroscopic system was 20 nK, which was achieved in 1995 at NIST. Subtracting the right hand side of (5) from the middle portion and rearranging gives\n:<math>\n\\frac{q_H}{T_H} - \\frac{q_C}{T_C} = 0,\n</math>\n\nwhere the negative sign indicates heat ejected from the system. This relationship suggests the existence of a state function, ''S'', defined by\n\n{{NumBlk|:|<math>dS = \\frac{dq_\\text{rev}}{T},</math>|8}}\n\nwhere the subscript indicates a reversible process. The change of this state function around any cycle is zero, as is necessary for any state function.  This function corresponds to the entropy of the system, which was described previously. Rearranging (8) gives a formula for temperature in terms of fictive infinitesimal quasi-reversible elements of entropy and heat:\n\n{{NumBlk|:|<math>T = \\frac{dq_\\text{rev}}{dS}.</math>|9}}\n\nFor a system, where entropy ''S''(''E'') is a function of its energy ''E'', the temperature ''T'' is given by\n\n{{NumBlk|:|<math>T^{-1} = \\frac{d}{dE} S(E),</math>|10}}\n\ni.e. the reciprocal of the temperature is the rate of increase of entropy with respect to energy.\n\n===Definition from statistical mechanics===\n[[Statistical mechanics]] defines temperature based on a system's fundamental degrees of freedom.  Eq.(10) is the defining relation of temperature. Eq. (9) can be derived from the principles underlying the [[fundamental thermodynamic relation]].\n\n===Generalized temperature from single-particle statistics===\nIt is possible to extend the definition of temperature even to systems of few particles, like in a [[quantum dot]]. The generalized temperature is obtained by considering time ensembles instead of configuration-space ensembles given in statistical mechanics in the case of thermal and particle exchange between a small system of [[fermion]]s (''N'' even less than 10) with a single/double-occupancy system.

This generalized temperature tends to the ordinary temperature when ''N'' goes to infinity.\n\n===Negative temperature===\n{{main|Negative temperature}}\nOn the empirical temperature scales that are not referenced to absolute zero, a negative temperature is one below the zero-point of the scale used. For example, [[dry ice]] has a sublimation temperature of {{val|\u221278.5|u=degC}} which is equivalent to {{val|\u2212109.3|u=degF}}. On the absolute kelvin scale this temperature is {{val|194.6|u=K}}. No body can be brought to exactly 0 K (the coldest possible temperature) by any finite practicable process; this is a consequence of the [[third law of thermodynamics]].\n\nThe international kinetic theory temperature of a body cannot take negative values. The thermodynamic temperature scale, however, is not so constrained. \n\nFor a body of matter, there can sometimes be conceptually defined, in terms of microscopic degrees of freedom, namely particle spins, a subsystem, with a temperature other than that of the whole body. When the body is in its own state of internal thermodynamic equilibrium, the temperatures of the whole body and of the subsystem must be the same. The two temperatures can differ when, by work through externally imposed force fields, energy can be transferred to and from the subsystem, separately from the rest of the body; then the whole body is not in its own state of internal thermodynamic equilibrium. There is an upper limit of energy such a spin subsystem can attain.\n\nConsidering the subsystem to be in a temporary state of virtual thermodynamic equilibrium, it is possible to obtain a [[negative temperature]] on the thermodynamic scale. Thermodynamic temperature is the inverse of the derivative of the subsystem's entropy with respect to its internal energy. As the subsystem's internal energy increases, the entropy increases for some range, but eventually attains a maximum value and then begins to decrease as the highest energy states begin to fill. At the point of maximum entropy, the temperature function shows the behavior of a [[Mathematical singularity|singularity]], because the slope of the entropy function decreases to zero and then turns negative. As the subsystem's entropy reaches its maximum, its thermodynamic temperature goes to positive infinity, switching to negative infinity as the slope turns negative. Such negative temperatures are hotter than any positive temperature. Over time, when the subsystem is exposed to the rest of the body, which has a positive temperature, energy is transferred as heat from the negative temperature subsystem to the positive temperature system.<ref>{{cite book\n|title=Thermal Physics\n|last=Kittel |first=Charles\n|authorlink=Charles Kittel\n|author2=Kroemer, Herbert |authorlink2=Herbert Kroemer\n|year=1980\n|edition=2nd\n|publisher=W.H.

The neutron stars in the model were 1.2 and 1.6 solar masses respectively, were roughly {{val|20|u=km}} in diameter, and were orbiting around their barycenter (common center of mass) at about {{val|390|u=Hz}} during the last several milliseconds before they completely merged. The 350&nbsp;GK portion was a small volume located at the pair's developing common core and varied from roughly {{val|1|to|7|u=km}} across over a time span of around 5&nbsp;ms. Imagine two city-sized objects of unimaginable density orbiting each other at the same frequency as the G4 musical note (the 28th white key on a piano). It's also noteworthy that at 350 GK, the average neutron has a vibrational speed of 30% the speed of light and a relativistic mass (''m'') 5% greater than its rest mass (''m''<sub>0</sub>).&nbsp; [https://arxiv.org/pdf/astro-ph/0507099.pdf ''Torus Formation in Neutron Star Mergers and Well-Localized Short Gamma-Ray Bursts''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171122171839/https://arxiv.org/pdf/astro-ph/0507099.pdf |date=2017-11-22 }}, R.
