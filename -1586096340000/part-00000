Unlike the Americans, the Soviets fielded experienced veterans who played together for years.

Unlike the Americans, the Soviets fielded experienced veterans who played together for years.

They had intense dispassion for the world. \n\nBrahmacharini Asha had in 1946 written an article entitled, ''\u2018Hindu Women\u2019s Right to Sannyasa\u2019'' published in Udbodhan magazine, in which she expressed her strong desire for the life of renunciation. \n\nFrom 1954 to 1958, Sri Sarada Math was a branch centre of the Ramakrishna Math at Belur.

Then on 2 January 1959, in the Old Shrine of Belur Math, the President, Swami Sankarananda and other senior monks conducted the Viraja Homa, and the eight Brahmacharinis were ordained into formal Sannyasa.

With this, the President of the Sri Sarada Math was also given the responsibilities to give spiritual initiation (Mantra Diksha), brahmacharya initiation and the conferring of [[Sannyasa]] to eligible women. Thus, an independent Order of Sannyasinis were created. \n\nSri [[Sankaracharya]] did not sanction sannyasa for women. But by his love and grace, [[Swami Vivekananda]] laid the foundation to admit women into the Puri [[Sampradaya]], one of the ten Orders of the Dasanami [[Sampradaya]] started by [[Sankaracharya]]. Not only this, the nuns were also given the right to confer Sannyasa upon other aspiring women.
