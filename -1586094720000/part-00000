As every operation may have complications, surgery is only recommended for severely obese people (BMI&nbsp;>&nbsp;40) who have failed to lose weight following dietary modification and pharmacological treatment. Weight loss surgery relies on various principles: the two most common approaches are reducing the volume of the stomach (e.g. by [[adjustable gastric band]]ing and [[Vertical banded gastroplasty surgery|vertical banded gastroplasty]]), which produces an earlier sense of satiation, and reducing the length of bowel that comes into contact with food (e.g. by [[gastric bypass surgery]] or [[Duodenal-jejunal bypass liner|endoscopic duodenal-jejunal bypass surgery]]<ref name=\"SullivanEndo15\">{{cite book |chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=IXLdBgAAQBAJ&pg=PA70 |chapter=Endoscopic Treatment of Obesity |title=Gastrointestinal Endoscopy: New Technologies and Changing Paradigms |author=Sullivan, S. |editor=Jonnalagadda, S.S. |publisher=Springer |pages=61\u201382 |year=2015 |isbn=9781493920327 |accessdate=18 March 2016}}</ref><ref name=\"MunozEndo15\">{{cite book |chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=HHmBCgAAQBAJ&pg=PA494 |chapter=Chapter 51: Endoscopic Duodenal-Jejunal Bypass Sleeve Treatment for Obesity |title=Obesity, Bariatric and Metabolic Surgery: A Practical Guide |author1=Mu\u00f1oz, R. |author2=Escalona, A. |editor=Agrawal, S. |publisher=Springer |pages=493\u2013498 |year=2015 |isbn=9783319043432 |accessdate=18 March 2016}}</ref>), which directly reduces absorption.
