In June 1914 it was shortened to ''Hearst's'' and was ultimately titled ''Hearst's International'' in May 1922. In order to spare serious cutbacks at [[Hearst Castle|San Simeon]], Hearst merged the magazine ''Hearst's International'' with ''Cosmopolitan'' effective March 1925. But while the ''Cosmopolitan'' title on the cover remained at a [[typeface]] of eight-four [[Point (typography)|points]], over time span the typeface of the ''Hearst's International'' decreased to thirty-six points and then to a barely legible twelve points. After Hearst died in 1951, the ''Hearst's International'' disappeared from the magazine cover altogether in April 1952.<ref>{{cite book |last= Landers|first= James |year= 2010|title=The Improbable First Century of Cosmopolitan Magazine |url=https://archive.org/details/improbablefirstc0000land|url-access= registration|location= |publisher= [[University of Missouri Press]]|isbn= 9780826272331|pages = [https://archive.org/details/improbablefirstc0000land/page/169 169\u2013213] }}</ref>\n\nWith a circulation of 1,700,000 in the 1930s, ''Cosmopolitan'' had an advertising income of $5,000,000.

In June 1914 it was shortened to ''Hearst's'' and was ultimately titled ''Hearst's International'' in May 1922. In order to spare serious cutbacks at [[Hearst Castle|San Simeon]], Hearst merged the magazine ''Hearst's International'' with ''Cosmopolitan'' effective March 1925. But while the ''Cosmopolitan'' title on the cover remained at a [[typeface]] of eight-four [[Point (typography)|points]], over time span the typeface of the ''Hearst's International'' decreased to thirty-six points and then to a barely legible twelve points.

They were built using the same molds, but cheaper material (fiberglass instead of carbon fiber) and a simpler chassis. Of the 10 produced in the movie, one was returned to W Motors and is displayed in their showroom. The other nine were destroyed.\n\nA single Lykan HyperSport replica was also used in the 2018 British ''Fast & Furious Live'' show. It has since been sold to a private owner.\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery mode=\"packed\">\nFile:2016-03-01 Geneva Motor Show 0992.JPG|Lykan HyperSport at the [[Geneva Motor Show#2016|2016 Geneva Motor Show]].\nFile:Principaute de Monaco april 2014 2014-04-22 00-52.jpg|Rear view.\nFile:Lykan HyperSport (17674415112).jpg|Lykan Hypersport at [[Auto Shanghai]] 2015\nFile:Lykan Hypersport - Abu-Dhabi Police Edition.jpeg|Lykan Hypersport - Abu-Dhabi Police Edition on display at GITEX 2015\n</gallery>\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External Links==\n{{Sister project links\n |1= |collapsible= |display=Lykan HyperSport |position= |style=\n |wikt=no |c=Category:Lykan HyperSport |commonscat=Category:Lykan HyperSport |n=no |q=no |s=no |author=no |b=no |v=no\n |voy=no |d=Q13408086 |m=no |mw=no |species=no |species_author=no\n}}\n{{Official website|https://wmotors.ae/lykan-hypersport.html}}\n\n{{Automotive industry in Lebanon}}\n{{Automotive industry in the United Arab Emirates}}\n{{Authority control}}\n\n[[Category:Cars introduced in 2013]]\n[[Category:Rear mid-engine, rear-wheel-drive vehicles]]\n[[Category:Sports cars]]\n[[Category:Science and technology in Lebanon]]\n[[Category:First car made by manufacturer]]\n[[Category:Cars powered by boxer engines]]\n", "name_user": "Damien Linnane", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eFilm version:ce", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lykan_HyperSport"}

His brother, Canadiens' legend and fellow [[Hockey Hall of Fame]]r [[Maurice Richard]], was nicknamed \"The Rocket\". Fifteen years younger and three inches shorter, Henri went by  \"'''The Pocket Rocket'''\". Henri won 11 [[Stanley Cup]]s as a player, the most in NHL history. In 2017 Richard was named one of the '[[100 Greatest NHL Players]]' in history.<ref>{{cite web|title=100 Greatest NHL Players|url=https://www.nhl.com/fans/nhl-centennial/100-greatest-nhl-players|website=NHL.com|accessdate=January 1, 2017|date=January 1, 2017}}</ref>\n\n==Early life==\nHenri Richard was born on February 29, 1936 in Montreal, the son of Alice (Laram\u00e9e) and On\u00e9sime Richard.<ref>[https://books.google.ca/books?id=Ozsu-y42zbcC&pg=PT23&dq=alice+Laram%C3%A9e+richard&hl=en&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwjZ94zltoroAhWAlnIEHdzPC5QQ6AEwAHoECAYQAQ]</ref> His father worked as a machinist for the [[Canadian Pacific Railway]], specifically at the [[CPR Angus Shops|Angus Yards]].  His older brother [[Maurice Richard]] played hockey for the [[Montreal Canadiens]] beginning in 1942, when Henri was six years old.  Maurice Richard quickly became a superstar player for the Canadiens, earning the nickname Rocket Richard, and Henri Richard wished to emulate his brother and go into hockey.  Henri joined the junior Montreal Canadiens as a 15 year old, and led the [[Quebec Major Junior Hockey League|QMJHL]] in scoring for two consecutive seasons before being promoted to the NHL.<ref name=\"NYT obit\">{{cite web |last1=Goldstein |first1=Richard |title=Henri Richard, Hall of Fame Center for Montreal Canadiens, Dies at 84 |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/06/sports/hockey/henri-richard-dead.html |website=nytimes.com |publisher=New York Times |accessdate=March 8, 2020 |date=March 6, 2020}}</ref><ref name=\"Globe obit\">{{cite web |last1=Hawthorn |first1=Tom |title=Montreal Canadiens great Henri Richard won a record 11 Cups |url=https://www.theglobeandmail.com/sports/article-montreal-canadiens-great-henri-richard-won-a-record-11-cups/ |website=theglobeandmail.com |publisher=The Globe and Mail |accessdate=March 8, 2020 |date=March 7, 2020}}</ref><ref name=\"Gazette obit\">{{cite web |title=Habs icon Henri Richard was a fierce competitor who won record 11 Cups |url=https://montrealgazette.com/sports/hockey/nhl/hockey-inside-out/habs-icon-henri-richard-a-fierce-competitor-who-won-record-11-cups |website=montrealgazette.com |publisher=Postmedia |accessdate=March 8, 2020 |date=March 6, 2020}}</ref><ref name=\"CBC obit\">{{cite web |last1=Lindeman |first1=Tracey |title=Canadiens legend Henri Richard dies at 84 |url=https://www.cbc.ca/sports/hockey/nhl/nhl-montreal-canadiens-henri-richard-obit-1.5488245 |website=cbc.ca |publisher=Canadian Broadcasting Corporation |accessdate=March 8, 2020 |date=March 6, 2020}}</ref>\n\n==Playing career==\n[[File:Henri Richard.jpg|thumb|right|Henri Richard signing autographs in 2011]]\n\nHenri Richard began his professional career playing on the same team as his older, more famous brother; and comparisons between himself and his brother were easy to make.  He was nicknamed \"Pocket Rocket\" while still a junior in reference to his brother's nickname \"Rocket Richard,\" as well as the fact that Henri Richard was shorter than his brother.<ref name=\"NYT obit\" /><ref name=\"Gazette obit\" />\n\nThe two Richard brothers' style of play was quite different.  Maurice Richard was famous for driving at the net with brute force; however Henri Richard preferred tactical playmaking and outthinking the opponent.  Maurice shot left; Henri shot right.  Maurice was a goalscorer who was the first to score [[50 goals in 50 games]], and led the league in goals on five occasions; Henri led the league in assists twice, in [[1957\u201358 NHL season|1957\u201358]] and in [[1962\u201363 NHL season|1962\u201363]].  Maurice was strong; Henri was fast.  However, they had one thing in common: both were willing to be physical on the ice.  <ref name=\"Gazette obit\" /><ref name=\"Macleans\">{{cite web |last1=Frayne |first1=Trent |title=How the \u201cPocket Rocket\u201d beat his kid-brother jinx |url=https://archive.macleans.ca/article/1958/3/29/how-the-pocket-rocket-beat-his-kid-brother-jinx |website=macleans.ca |publisher=Maclean's |accessdate=March 8, 2020 |date=March 29, 1958}}</ref>\n\nInitially, Montreal Canadiens coach [[Toe Blake]] kept the two Richard brothers apart on the ice, fearing that his star Maurice Richard would give up goalscoring opportunities to his younger brother.  However, one game against Chicago a couple of injuries forced Blake to play the Richard brothers together, and Henri assisted Maurice on a goal in the third period, and from then on he played the brothers together on a line with hall-of-famer [[Dickie Moore (ice hockey)|Dickie Moore]].  Initially, Maurice would watch out for his brother, and go after anyone who pushed his younger brother around; but after Henri won a fight while Maurice was stuck in the penalty box, Maurice realized that his brother could take care of himself, and stopped looking out for him.  Toe Blake later said that playing with Henri forced Maurice to become a better player, and helped prolong Maurice's career.  Later in 1958, when Maurice Richard was injured, Toe Blake moved [[Marcel Bonin]] to the line to take Maurice's place, and Henri Richard's line continued to produce goals, showing the world that Maurice Richard was not simply carrying his little brother. <ref name=\"Globe obit\" /><ref name=\"Macleans\" />\n\nIn 1957\u201358, he was named to the [[NHL All-Star Team|First All-Star Team]] and in [[1958\u201359 NHL season|1959]] he was named to the Second All-Star Team; he was also named to the Second All-Star Team in [[1960-61 NHL season|1961]] and [[1962-63 NHL season|1963]]. <ref name=\"Globe obit\" /><ref name=\":0\" />\n\nHe scored the Stanley Cup clinching goal at the 2:20 mark of the first overtime of Game Six in the [[1966 Stanley Cup Finals]] against the [[Detroit Red Wings]], when a pass bounced off of Henri Richard's body into the net while Detroit's goalie [[Roger Crozier]] was still sprawled out on the ice.  In the [[1971 Stanley Cup Finals]], Richard scored the game-tying and Stanley Cup-winning goals in Game Seven against the [[Chicago Black Hawks]].  This particular final was a controversial one for Henri Richard, when he was benched in Game 5 after accusing coach [[Al MacNeil]] of discriminating against French-speaking players on the team in an interview, an accusation that resulted in MacNeil getting death threats and requiring a bodyguard for himself and his family during Game 7.  Henri Richard went on to call MacNeil \"the worst coach I have ever played for.\"  Despite winning the Stanley Cup, MacNeil was demoted to coaching the Canadiens' junior hockey team, the Nova Scotia Voyageurs; while after captain [[Jean Beliveau]] retired, Henri Richard was promoted to team [[Captain (ice hockey)|captain]].  MacNeil and Richard later reconciled. <ref name=\"NYT obit\" /><ref name=\"Globe obit\" /><ref name=\"Gazette obit\" /><ref>{{cite web |title=1966 NHL Stanley Cup Playoffs Summary |url=https://www.hockey-reference.com/playoffs/NHL_1966.html |website=hockey-reference.com |publisher=Sports Reference, Inc. |accessdate=March 8, 2020}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=Montreal Canadiens: Stanley Cup Champions 1971 |url=http://bigmouthsports.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/1971-Stanley-Cup-Playoff-boxscores-MTL.pdf |website=bigmouthsports.com |accessdate=March 8, 2020}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |last1=Zadarnowski |first1=Andrew |title=Coaching The Farm: 1968-1981 \u2014 Al MacNeil presided over the greatest era |url=https://www.habseyesontheprize.com/history/2018/4/20/17250550/coaching-the-farm-montreal-canadiens-1968-1981-al-macneil-presided-over-the-greatest-era |website=Eyes on the Prize |publisher=SB Nation |accessdate=March 8, 2020 |date=April 20, 2018}}</ref><ref name=\"NHL obit\">{{cite web |title=Henri Richard dies at 84, won NHL-record 11 Cup titles with Canadiens |url=https://www.nhl.com/news/henri-richard-dies/c-315927688 |website=NHL.com |publisher=National Hockey League |accessdate=March 8, 2020 |date=March 6, 2020}}</ref>\n\n==Retirement and legacy==\n\n[[File:HHOF July 2010 Canadiens locker 08 (H.

His older brother [[Maurice Richard]] played hockey for the [[Montreal Canadiens]] beginning in 1942, when Henri was six years old.  Maurice Richard quickly became a superstar player for the Canadiens, earning the nickname Rocket Richard, and Henri Richard wished to emulate his brother and go into hockey.

He was nicknamed \"Pocket Rocket\" while still a junior in reference to his brother's nickname \"Rocket Richard,\" as well as the fact that Henri Richard was shorter than his brother.<ref name=\"NYT obit\" /><ref name=\"Gazette obit\" />\n\nThe two Richard brothers' style of play was quite different.  Maurice Richard was famous for driving at the net with brute force; however Henri Richard preferred tactical playmaking and outthinking the opponent.  Maurice shot left; Henri shot right.  Maurice was a goalscorer who was the first to score [[50 goals in 50 games]], and led the league in goals on five occasions; Henri led the league in assists twice, in [[1957\u201358 NHL season|1957\u201358]] and in [[1962\u201363 NHL season|1962\u201363]].  Maurice was strong; Henri was fast.  However, they had one thing in common: both were willing to be physical on the ice.  <ref name=\"Gazette obit\" /><ref name=\"Macleans\">{{cite web |last1=Frayne |first1=Trent |title=How the \u201cPocket Rocket\u201d beat his kid-brother jinx |url=https://archive.macleans.ca/article/1958/3/29/how-the-pocket-rocket-beat-his-kid-brother-jinx |website=macleans.ca |publisher=Maclean's |accessdate=March 8, 2020 |date=March 29, 1958}}</ref>\n\nInitially, Montreal Canadiens coach [[Toe Blake]] kept the two Richard brothers apart on the ice, fearing that his star Maurice Richard would give up goalscoring opportunities to his younger brother.  However, one game against Chicago a couple of injuries forced Blake to play the Richard brothers together, and Henri assisted Maurice on a goal in the third period, and from then on he played the brothers together on a line with hall-of-famer [[Dickie Moore]].  Initially, Maurice would watch out for his brother, and go after anyone who pushed his younger brother around; but after Henri won a fight while Maurice was stuck in the penalty box, Maurice realized that his brother could take care of himself, and stopped looking out for him.  Toe Blake later said that playing with Henri forced Maurice to become a better player, and helped prolong Maurice's career.  Later in 1958, when Maurice Richard was injured, Toe Blake moved [[Marcel Bonin]] to the line to take Maurice's place, and Henri Richard's line continued to produce goals, showing the world that Maurice Richard was not simply carrying his little brother. <ref name=\"Globe obit\" /><ref name=\"Macleans\" />\n\nIn 1957\u201358, he was named to the [[NHL All-Star Team|First All-Star Team]] and in [[1958\u201359 NHL season|1959]] he was named to the Second All-Star Team; he was also named to the Second All-Star Team in [[1960-61 NHL season|1961]] and [[1962-63 NHL season|1963]]. <ref name=\"Globe obit\" /><ref name=\":0\" />\n\nHe scored the Stanley Cup clinching goal at the 2:20 mark of the first overtime of Game Six in the [[1966 Stanley Cup Finals]] against the [[Detroit Red Wings]], when a pass bounced off of Henri Richard's body into the net while Detroit's goalie [[Roger Crozier]] was still sprawled out on the ice.  In the [[1971 Stanley Cup Finals]], Richard scored the game-tying and Stanley Cup-winning goals in Game Seven against the [[Chicago Black Hawks]].  This particular final was a controversial one for Henri Richard, when he was benched in Game 5 after accusing coach [[Al MacNeil]] of discriminating against French-speaking players on the team in an interview, an accusation that resulted in MacNeil getting death threats and requiring a bodyguard for himself and his family during Game 7.  Henri Richard went on to call MacNeil \"the worst coach I have ever played for.\"  Despite winning the Stanley Cup, MacNeil was demoted to coaching the Canadiens' junior hockey team, the Nova Scotia Voyageurs; while after captain [[Jean Beliveau]] retired, Henri Richard was promoted to team [[Captain (ice hockey)|captain]].  MacNeil and Richard later reconciled. <ref name=\"NYT obit\" /><ref name=\"Globe obit\" /><ref name=\"Gazette obit\" /><ref>{{cite web |title=1966 NHL Stanley Cup Playoffs Summary |url=https://www.hockey-reference.com/playoffs/NHL_1966.html |website=hockey-reference.com |publisher=Sports Reference, Inc. |accessdate=March 8, 2020}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=Montreal Canadiens: Stanley Cup Champions 1971 |url=http://bigmouthsports.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/1971-Stanley-Cup-Playoff-boxscores-MTL.pdf |website=bigmouthsports.com |accessdate=March 8, 2020}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |last1=Zadarnowski |first1=Andrew |title=Coaching The Farm: 1968-1981 \u2014 Al MacNeil presided over the greatest era |url=https://www.habseyesontheprize.com/history/2018/4/20/17250550/coaching-the-farm-montreal-canadiens-1968-1981-al-macneil-presided-over-the-greatest-era |website=Eyes on the Prize |publisher=SB Nation |accessdate=March 8, 2020 |date=April 20, 2018}}</ref><ref name=\"NHL obit\">{{cite web |title=Henri Richard dies at 84, won NHL-record 11 Cup titles with Canadiens |url=https://www.nhl.com/news/henri-richard-dies/c-315927688 |website=NHL.com |publisher=National Hockey League |accessdate=March 8, 2020 |date=March 6, 2020}}</ref>\n\n==Retirement and legacy==\n\n[[File:HHOF July 2010 Canadiens locker 08 (H.
