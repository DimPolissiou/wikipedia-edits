Unveiled on the August 23, 2016 episode of ''[[WWE SmackDown|SmackDown Live]]'', it was created to be the counterpart title to the then-WWE Tag Team Championship, which became exclusive to [[Raw (WWE brand)|Raw]] as a result of the [[2016 WWE draft]] and was renamed to [[WWE Raw Tag Team Championship|Raw Tag Team Championship]].<ref>{{cite web|last1=Martin|first1=Adam|title=Daniel Bryan to reveal two new championships exclusive to Smackdown tonight from Connecticut|url=http://www.wrestleview.com/wwe-news/66258-daniel-bryan-reveal-two-new-championships-exclusive-smackdown-live-tonight-connecticut/|website=wrestleview.com|accessdate=August 23, 2016}}</ref>\n\nThe championship is generally contested in [[Professional wrestling match types|professional wrestling matches]], in which participants execute [[Screenplay|scripted]] finishes rather than contend in [[Competition#Sports|direct competition]]. The inaugural champions were [[Heath Slater]] and [[Rhyno]], who won the title in a tournament final at [[Backlash (2016)|Backlash]] on September 11, 2016. The current champions are [[The New Day (professional wrestling)|The New Day]], who are in their sixth reign as a team; individually, it is the sixth reign for [[Big E (wrestler)|Big E]] and the fifth for [[Kofi Kingston]] and [[Xavier Woods]]. Big E represented the team in a [[Professional wrestling match types#Basic non-elimination matches|triple threat match]] involving [[Jey Uso]] (of [[The Usos]]) and then-co-champion [[The Miz]] (of [[The Miz and John Morrison]]), who Big E pinned, on the April 17, 2020 episode of ''[[WWE SmackDown|SmackDown]]''.\n\nAs of {{CURRENTMONTHNAME}} {{CURRENTDAY}}, {{CURRENTYEAR}}, overall there have been 20 reigns between 12 teams composed of 23 individual champions, and one vacancy. The team of [[Heath Slater]] and [[Rhyno]] were the inaugural champions. [[The New Day (professional wrestling)|The New Day]] as a stable have the most reigns at six, while individually, stable member [[Big E (wrestler)|Big E]] has the most reigns, also at six. As a team and individually, [[The Usos]] (Jey Uso and Jimmy Uso) have the longest singular reign at 182 days for their third reign, and they have the longest combined reign at 381 days (380 days as recognized by WWE). [[The Miz]] & [[Shane McMahon]] and [[The Hardy Boyz]] ([[Jeff Hardy]] and [[Matt Hardy]]) are tied with the shortest reign at 21 days (although WWE recognizes The Hardy Boyz as the shortest at 20 days). The oldest champion is Shane McMahon, winning the title at 49 years old, while the youngest is [[Jason Jordan]] when he won it at 28.\n\n== Reigns ==\n{{Professional wrestling title history top|active=yes|team=yes|days2=yes}}\n{{PWtitlereign\n|number   = 1\n|champion = {{sortname|Heath|Slater}} and {{sortname||Rhyno|Rhyno}}\n|reign    = 1\n|date     = {{dts|September 11, 2016}}\n|days     = {{age in days nts|September 11, 2016|December 4, 2016}}\n|days2    = {{age in days nts|September 11, 2016|December 3, 2016}}\n|location = [[Richmond, Virginia|Richmond, VA]]\n|event    = [[Backlash (2016)|Backlash]]\n|notes    = As a result of the [[2016 WWE draft]], the [[WWE Raw Tag Team Championship|WWE Tag Team Championship]] became exclusive to [[Raw (WWE brand)|Raw]].

wrestling]] [[world tag team championship]] contested in [[WWE]] on the [[SmackDown (WWE brand)|SmackDown]] brand. Unveiled on the August 23, 2016 episode of ''[[WWE SmackDown|SmackDown Live]]'', it was created to be the counterpart title to the then-WWE Tag Team Championship, which became exclusive to [[Raw (WWE brand)|Raw]] as a result of the [[2016 WWE draft]] and was renamed to [[WWE Raw Tag Team Championship|Raw Tag Team Championship]].<ref>{{cite web|last1=Martin|first1=Adam|title=Daniel Bryan to reveal two new championships exclusive to Smackdown tonight from Connecticut|url=http://www.wrestleview.com/wwe-news/66258-daniel-bryan-reveal-two-new-championships-exclusive-smackdown-live-tonight-connecticut/|website=wrestleview.com|accessdate=August 23, 2016}}</ref>\n\nThe championship is generally contested in [[Professional wrestling match types|professional wrestling matches]], in which participants execute [[Screenplay|scripted]] finishes rather than contend in [[Competition#Sports|direct competition]]. The inaugural champions were [[Heath Slater]] and [[Rhyno]], who won the title in a tournament final at [[Backlash (2016)|Backlash]] on September 11, 2016. The current champions are [[The New Day (professional wrestling)|The New Day]], who are in their sixth reign as a team; individually, it is the sixth reign for [[Big E (wrestler)|Big E]] and the fifth for [[Kofi Kingston]] and [[Xavier Woods]]. Big E represented the team in a [[Professional wrestling match types#Basic non-elimination matches|triple threat match]] involving [[Jey Uso]] (of [[The Usos]]) and then-co-champion [[The Miz]] (of [[The Miz and John Morrison]]), who Big E pinned, on the April 17, 2020 episode of ''[[WWE SmackDown|SmackDown]]''.\n\nAs of {{CURRENTMONTHNAME}} {{CURRENTDAY}}, {{CURRENTYEAR}}, overall there have been 20 reigns between 12 teams composed of 23 individual champions, and one vacancy. The team of [[Heath Slater]] and [[Rhyno]] were the inaugural champions. [[The New Day (professional wrestling)|The New Day]] as a stable have the most reigns at six, while individually, stable member [[Big E (wrestler)|Big E]] has the most reigns, also at six. As a team and individually, [[The Usos]] (Jey Uso and Jimmy Uso) have the longest singular reign at 182 days for their third reign, and they have the longest combined reign at 381 days (380 days as recognized by WWE). [[The Miz]] & [[Shane McMahon]] and [[The Hardy Boyz]] ([[Jeff Hardy]] and [[Matt Hardy]]) are tied with the shortest reign at 21 days (although WWE recognizes The Hardy Boyz as the shortest at 20 days). The oldest champion is Shane McMahon, winning the title at 49 years old, while the youngest is [[Jason Jordan]] when he won it at 28.\n\n== Reigns ==\n{{Professional wrestling title history top|active=yes|team=yes|days2=yes}}\n{{PWtitlereign\n|number   = 1\n|champion = {{sortname|Heath|Slater}} and {{sortname||Rhyno|Rhyno}}\n|reign    = 1\n|date     = {{dts|September 11, 2016}}\n|days     = {{age in days nts|September 11, 2016|December 4, 2016}}\n|days2    = {{age in days nts|September 11, 2016|December 3, 2016}}\n|location = [[Richmond, Virginia|Richmond, VA]]\n|event    = [[Backlash (2016)|Backlash]]\n|notes    = As a result of the [[2016 WWE draft]], the [[WWE Raw Tag Team Championship|WWE Tag Team Championship]] became exclusive to [[Raw (WWE brand)|Raw]].

It is affectionately called \"The Mermaid of the Mediterranean\" ({{lang|ar|\u0639\u0631\u0648\u0633\u0629 \u0627\u0644\u0628\u062d\u0631}} {{lang|ar-Latn|\u02bfAr\u016bsat al-Ba\u1e25r}}; lit: 'bride of the sea'), describing its turquoise waters and its whitewashed buildings.

There is still a village in Thera (Santorini) named O\u03af\u03b1, [[Oia, Greece]] as well as another [[Tripoli, Greece|Tripoli]] in Greece. The Greeks were probably attracted to the site by its natural harbour, flanked on the western shore by the small, easily defensible [[peninsula]], on which they established their colony. The city then passed into the hands of the rulers of [[Cyrenaica]] (a [[Greeks|Greek]] colony on the North African shore, east of Tripoli, halfway to [[Egypt]]), although the [[Carthaginians]] later wrested it from the [[Greeks]].\n\nBy the latter half of the 2nd century BC, it belonged to the [[Ancient Rome|Romans]], who included it in their province of [[Africa Province|Africa]], and gave it the name of \"Regio Syrtica\". Around the beginning of the 3rd century [[Anno Domini|AD]], it became known as the Regio Tripolitana, meaning \"region of the three cities\", namely Oea (''i.e.'', modern Tripoli), [[Sabratha]] and [[Leptis Magna]]. It was probably raised to the rank of a separate province by [[Septimius Severus]], who was a native of Leptis Magna.\n[[File:Marcus Aurelius Arch Tripoli Libya.jpg|thumb|left|Roman [[Arch of Marcus Aurelius]]]]\nIn spite of centuries of Roman habitation, the only visible Roman remains, apart from scattered [[columns]] and [[Capital (architecture)|capitals]] (usually integrated in later buildings), is the Arch of [[Marcus Aurelius]] from the 2nd century AD. The fact that Tripoli has been continuously inhabited, unlike ''e.g.'', Sabratha and Leptis Magna, has meant that the inhabitants have either quarried material from older buildings (destroying them in the process) or built on top of them, burying them beneath the streets, where they remain largely unexcavated.\n\nThere is evidence to suggest that the Tripolitania region was in some economic decline during the 5th and 6th centuries, in part due to the political unrest spreading across the Mediterranean world in the wake of the collapse of the [[Western Roman empire]], as well as pressure from the invading [[Vandals]].\n\nAccording to [[al-Baladhuri]], Tripoli was, unlike Western North Africa, taken by the Muslims very early after [[Muslim conquest of Egypt|Alexandria]], in the 22nd year of the [[Hijri year|Hijra]], that is between 30 November 642 and 18 November 643 AD. Following the conquest, Tripoli was ruled by dynasties based in [[Cairo]], [[Egypt]] (first the [[Fatimids]], and later the [[Mamluks]]), and [[Kairouan]] in [[Ifriqiya]] (the Arab [[Fihrids]], [[Muhallabids]] and [[Aghlabid]] dynasties). For some time it was a part of the [[Berbers|Berber]] [[Almohad dynasty|Almohad empire]] and of the [[Hafsid Dynasty|Hafsids kingdom]]. \n{{clear}}\n\n=== 16th to 19th centuries ===\n[[File:Tripoli by Piri Reis.jpg|thumb|left|Historic map of Tripoli by [[Piri Reis]]]]\nIn 1510, it was taken by [[Pedro Navarro, Count of Oliveto]] for [[Spain]], and, in 1530, it was assigned, together with Malta, to the [[Knights Hospitaller|Knights of St. John]], who had lately been expelled by the [[Ottoman Turks]] from their stronghold on the island of [[Rhodes]].<ref>Britannica,\n[https://www.britannica.com/place/Tripoli Tripoli], britannica.com, USA, accessed on 7 July 2019</ref>\nFinding themselves in very hostile territory, the Knights enhanced the city's walls and other defenses. Though built on top of a number of older buildings (possibly including a Roman public bath), much of the earliest defensive structures of the Tripoli castle (or \"Assaraya al-Hamra\", ''i.e.'', the \"Red Castle\") are attributed to the Knights of St John.\n\nHaving previously combated [[piracy]] from their base on Rhodes, the reason that the Knights were given charge of the city was to prevent it from relapsing into the nest of [[Barbary pirate]]s{{citation needed|date=June 2016}} it had been prior to the Spanish occupation. The disruption the pirates caused to the Christian shipping lanes in the [[Mediterranean Sea|Mediterranean]] had been one of the main incentives for the Spanish conquest of the city.\n[[File:A Mapp of the Citie and Port of Tripoli in Barbary - by John Seller 1675.JPG|thumb|Tripoli, 1675, map by [[John Seller]] ]]\nThe knights kept the city with some trouble until 1551, [[Siege of Tripoli (1551)|when they were compelled to surrender to the Ottomans]], led by Muslim Turk [[Turgut Reis]].<ref>{{cite book |author= Reynolds, Clark G. |title= Command of the Sea&nbsp;\u2013 The History and Strategy of Maritime Empires |publisher= Morrow |year= 1974 |pages= 120\u2013121 |isbn= 978-0-688-00267-1 |quote= Ottomans extended their western maritime frontier across North Africa under the naval command of another Greek Moslem, Torghoud (or Dragut), who succeeded Barbarossa upon the latter's death in 1546.}}</ref> Turgut Reis served as pasha of Tripoli.

His body was taken from [[Malta]], where he had fallen during the Ottoman siege of the island, to a tomb in the [[mosque]] he had established close to his palace in Tripoli. The palace has since disappeared (supposedly it was situated between the so-called \"Ottoman prison\" and the arch of [[Marcus Aurelius]]), but the mosque, along with his tomb, still stands, close to the Bab Al-Bahr gate.\n\nAfter the capture by the Ottoman Turks, Tripoli once again became a base of operation for Barbary pirates. One of several Western attempts to dislodge them again was a Royal Navy attack under [[John Narborough]] in 1675, of which a vivid eye-witness account has survived.<ref>''The Diary of [[Henry Teonge]] Chaplain on Board HM's Ships Assistance, Bristol and Royal Oak 1675\u20131679.

Intended to function as enforcers of local administration, the captain of the Janissaries and his cronies were often the ''de facto'' rulers.\n\nIn 1711, [[Ahmed Karamanli]], a Janissary officer of Turkish origin, killed the Ottoman governor, the \"[[Pasha]]\", and established himself as ruler of the Tripolitania region. By 1714, he had asserted a sort of semi-independence from the Ottoman Sultan, heralding in the [[Karamanli dynasty]]. The Pashas of Tripoli were expected to pay a regular tributary tax to the Sultan but were in all other aspects rulers of an independent kingdom. This order of things continued under the rule of his descendants, accompanied by the brazen piracy and blackmailing until 1835 when the Ottoman Empire took advantage of an internal struggle and re-established its authority.\n\nThe Ottoman province (''vilayet'') of Tripoli (including the dependent ''[[sanjak]]'' of [[Cyrenaica]]) lay along the southern shore of the Mediterranean between [[Tunisia]] in the west and [[Egypt]] in the east. Besides the city itself, the area included Cyrenaica (the Barca plateau), the chain of [[oases]] in the Aujila depression, [[Fezzan]] and the oases of [[Ghadames]] and [[Ghat, Libya|Ghat]], separated by sandy and stony wastelands.\n\n=== Barbary Wars ===\n{{Main|First Barbary War|Second Barbary War}}\n[[File:Burning of the uss philadelphia.jpg|thumb|upright|The USS ''Philadelphia'', heavy frigate of the [[United States Navy]], burning at the [[Second Battle of Tripoli Harbor]] during the [[First Barbary War]] in 1804]]\nIn the early part of the 19th century, the regency at Tripoli, owing to its [[piracy|piratical]] practices, was twice involved in war with the United States. In May 1801, the pasha demanded an increase in the tribute ($83,000) which the U.S. government had been paying since 1796 for the protection of their commerce from piracy under the [[Treaty with Tripoli (1796)|1796 Treaty with Tripoli]]. The demand was refused by third President [[Thomas Jefferson]], and a naval force was sent from the United States to blockade Tripoli.\n\nThe [[First Barbary War]] (1801-1805) dragged on for four years. In 1803, Tripolitan fighters captured the U.S. Navy heavy frigate ''[[USS Philadelphia (1799)|Philadelphia]]'' and took its commander, Captain [[William Bainbridge]], and the entire crew as prisoners. This was after the ''Philadelphia'' was run aground when the captain tried to navigate too close to the port of Tripoli. After several hours aground and Tripolitan gun boats firing upon the ''Philadelphia'', though none ever struck the ''Philadelphia'', Captain Bainbridge made the decision to surrender. The ''Philadelphia'' was later turned against the Americans and anchored in Tripoli Harbor as a gun battery while her officers and crew were held prisoners in Tripoli. The following year, U.S. Navy Lieutenant [[Stephen Decatur]] led a successful daring nighttime raid to retake and burn the warship rather than see it remain in enemy hands. Decatur's men set fire to the ''Philadelphia'' and escaped.\n\nA notable incident in the war was the expedition undertaken by diplomatic Consul [[William Eaton (soldier)|William Eaton]] with the objective of replacing the pasha with an elder brother living in exile, who had promised to accede to all the wishes of the United States. Eaton, at the head of a mixed force of US Soldiers, Sailors, and Marines, along with Greek, Arab and Turkish mercenaries numbering approximately 500, marched across the Egyptian / Libyan desert from [[Alexandria]], [[Egypt]] and with the aid of three American warships, succeeded in [[Battle of Derna (1805)|capturing Derna]]. Soon afterward, on 3 June 1805, peace was concluded. The pasha ended his demands and received $60,000 as ransom for the ''Philadelphia'' prisoners under the [[Treaty with Tripoli (1805)|1805 Treaty with Tripoli]].\n\nIn 1815, in consequence of further outrages and due to the humiliation of the earlier defeat, Captains Bainbridge and [[Stephen Decatur]], at the head of an American squadron, again visited Tripoli and forced the pasha to comply with the demands of the United States.

According to diplomatic sources, the former Secretariat for Economy and Trade was moved to [[Benghazi]]; the Secretariat for Health to [[Kufra]]; and the remainder, excepting one, to Sirte, [[Muammar Gaddafi]]'s birthplace. In early 1993 it was announced that the Secretariat for Foreign Liaison and International Co-operation was to be moved to [[Ra's Lanuf]].

Locals in Libya must purchase dollars on the black market, rather than receiving dollars on the official rate of 1.37 Dinars to 1 US Dollar, due to Central bank(s) refusal to give US dollars to the public, the current pricing of Dollars amounts to 10 Dinars to 1 US dollar on the black market, driving the local Libyan economy into ruin and undermining local peoples purchasing power. Militias however have been benefiting from this exploit due to their armed influences and corrupt natures by purchasing dollars on the official rate of 1.30 to 1, and selling them US$1 to 10 LYD.\n\n== Architecture ==\n[[File:Tripoli - In der Altstadt 03.jpg|thumb|upright|Tripoli's Old City (El-Madina El-Kadima), situated in the city centre, is one of the classical sites of the Mediterranean and an important tourist attraction.]]\nThe city's old town, the [[Medina quarter|Medina]], is still unspoiled by mass-tourism, though it was increasingly exposed to more and more visitors from abroad, following the lifting of the UN embargo in 2003. However, the walled Medina retains much of its serene old-world ambiance.\n\nThree gates provided access to the old town: Bab Zanata in the west, Bab Hawara in the southeast and Bab Al-Bahr in the north wall. The city walls are still standing and can be climbed for good views of the city. The [[bazaar]] is also known for its traditional ware; fine jewellery and clothes can be found in the local markets.\n\nThere are a number of buildings that were constructed by the Italian colonial rulers and later demolished under Gaddafi. They included the Royal Miramare Theatre, next to the Red Castle, and Tripoli Railway Central Station.\n\n== Culture ==\nThe [[Red Castle Museum]] (''Assaraya al-Hamra''), a vast palace complex with numerous courtyards, dominates the city skyline and is located on the outskirts of the Medina. There are some classical statues and fountains from the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] period scattered around the castle.\n\n== Places of worship ==\nAmong the [[places of worship]], they are predominantly [[Islam|Muslim]] mosques.<ref>Britannica,\n[https://www.britannica.com/place/Libya Libya], britannica.com, USA, accessed on July 7, 2019</ref> There are also [[Christianity|Christian]] churches and temples : [[Apostolic Vicariate of Tripoli]] ([[Catholic Church]]), [[Coptic Orthodox Church]], [[Protestant churches]], [[Evangelical Churches]].\n\n== Education ==\nThe largest university in Tripoli, the [[University of Tripoli]], is a public university providing free education to the city's inhabitants.

The event happened after secular Zintani militias were accused with claims of smuggling drugs, alcohol and illegal items, known to have past ties with the Gaddafi Regime. Libya's Mufti Sadiq al Ghariani has praised the Libya Dawn Operation.\n\nThe result of the Battle for Tripoli's central airport was its complete destruction with 90% of the facilities incapacitated, or burned down with an unknown estimate Billions of dollars in Damage, with another 10 or so planes destroyed. The airport was shelled with [[BM-21 Grad|Grad]] rockets with reports of the [[Air Traffic Control]] tower completely destroyed, including the main reception building completely wrecked. Surrounding civilian residential areas and infrastructure, of which include Bridges, Electricity equipment, water equipment, and roads were also damaged in the fighting. Oil storage tankers containing large reserves of Kerosene fuels, gases and related chemicals were burnt and large plumes of smoke rose into the air.\n\nReconstruction efforts are currently underway with the GNA giving a contract amounting to $78 Million to an Italian firm 'Emaco Group' or \"Aeneas Consorzio\", to rebuild the destroyed facilities.

There is still a village in Thera (Santorini) named O\u03af\u03b1, [[Oia, Greece]] as well as another [[Tripoli, Greece|Tripoli]] in Greece. The Greeks were probably attracted to the site by its natural harbour, flanked on the western shore by the small, easily defensible [[peninsula]], on which they established their colony. The city then passed into the hands of the rulers of [[Cyrenaica]] (a [[Greeks|Greek]] colony on the North African shore, east of Tripoli, halfway to [[Egypt]]), although the [[Carthaginians]] later wrested it from the [[Greeks]].\n\nBy the latter half of the 2nd century BC, it belonged to the [[Ancient Rome|Romans]], who included it in their province of [[Africa Province|Africa]], and gave it the name of \"Regio Syrtica\". Around the beginning of the 3rd century [[Anno Domini|AD]], it became known as the Regio Tripolitana, meaning \"region of the three cities\", namely Oea (''i.e.'', modern Tripoli), [[Sabratha]] and [[Leptis Magna]]. It was probably raised to the rank of a separate province by [[Septimius Severus]], who was a native of Leptis Magna.\n[[File:Marcus Aurelius Arch Tripoli Libya.jpg|thumb|left|Roman [[Arch of Marcus Aurelius]]]]\nIn spite of centuries of Roman habitation, the only visible Roman remains, apart from scattered [[columns]] and [[Capital (architecture)|capitals]] (usually integrated in later buildings), is the Arch of [[Marcus Aurelius]] from the 2nd century AD. The fact that Tripoli has been continuously inhabited, unlike ''e.g.'', Sabratha and Leptis Magna, has meant that the inhabitants have either quarried material from older buildings (destroying them in the process) or built on top of them, burying them beneath the streets, where they remain largely unexcavated.\n\nThere is evidence to suggest that the Tripolitania region was in some economic decline during the 5th and 6th centuries, in part due to the political unrest spreading across the Mediterranean world in the wake of the collapse of the [[Western Roman empire]], as well as pressure from the invading [[Vandals]].\n\nAccording to [[al-Baladhuri]], Tripoli was, unlike Western North Africa, taken by the Muslims very early after [[Muslim conquest of Egypt|Alexandria]], in the 22nd year of the [[Hijri year|Hijra]], that is between 30 November 642 and 18 November 643 AD. Following the conquest, Tripoli was ruled by dynasties based in [[Cairo]], [[Egypt]] (first the [[Fatimids]], and later the [[Mamluks]]), and [[Kairouan]] in [[Ifriqiya]] (the Arab [[Fihrids]], [[Muhallabids]] and [[Aghlabid]] dynasties).

Intended to function as enforcers of local administration, the captain of the Janissaries and his cronies were often the ''de facto'' rulers.\n\nIn 1711, [[Ahmed Karamanli]], a Janissary officer of Turkish origin, killed the Ottoman governor, the \"[[Pasha]]\", and established himself as ruler of the Tripolitania region. By 1714, he had asserted a sort of semi-independence from the Ottoman Sultan, heralding in the [[Karamanli dynasty]]. The Pashas of Tripoli were expected to pay a regular tributary tax to the Sultan but were in all other aspects rulers of an independent kingdom. This order of things continued under the rule of his descendants, accompanied by the brazen piracy and blackmailing until 1835 when the Ottoman Empire took advantage of an internal struggle and re-established its authority.\n\nThe Ottoman province (''vilayet'') of Tripoli (including the dependent ''[[sanjak]]'' of [[Cyrenaica]]) lay along the southern shore of the Mediterranean between [[Tunisia]] in the west and [[Egypt]] in the east. Besides the city itself, the area included Cyrenaica (the Barca plateau), the chain of [[oases]] in the Aujila depression, [[Fezzan]] and the oases of [[Ghadames]] and [[Ghat, Libya|Ghat]], separated by sandy and stony wastelands.\n\n=== Barbary Wars ===\n{{Main|First Barbary War|Second Barbary War}}\n[[File:Burning of the uss philadelphia.jpg|thumb|upright|The USS ''Philadelphia'', heavy frigate of the [[United States Navy]], burning at the [[Second Battle of Tripoli Harbor]] during the [[First Barbary War]] in 1804]]\nIn the early part of the 19th century, the regency at Tripoli, owing to its [[piracy|piratical]] practices, was twice involved in war with the United States. In May 1801, the pasha demanded an increase in the tribute ($83,000) which the U.S. government had been paying since 1796 for the protection of their commerce from piracy under the [[Treaty with Tripoli (1796)|1796 Treaty with Tripoli]]. The demand was refused by third President [[Thomas Jefferson]], and a naval force was sent from the United States to blockade Tripoli.\n\nThe [[First Barbary War]] (1801-1805) dragged on for four years. In 1803, Tripolitan fighters captured the U.S. Navy heavy frigate ''[[USS Philadelphia (1799)|Philadelphia]]'' and took its commander, Captain [[William Bainbridge]], and the entire crew as prisoners. This was after the ''Philadelphia'' was run aground when the captain tried to navigate too close to the port of Tripoli. After several hours aground and Tripolitan gun boats firing upon the ''Philadelphia'', though none ever struck the ''Philadelphia'', Captain Bainbridge made the decision to surrender. The ''Philadelphia'' was later turned against the Americans and anchored in Tripoli Harbor as a gun battery while her officers and crew were held prisoners in Tripoli. The following year, U.S. Navy Lieutenant [[Stephen Decatur]] led a successful daring nighttime raid to retake and burn the warship rather than see it remain in enemy hands. Decatur's men set fire to the ''Philadelphia'' and escaped.\n\nA notable incident in the war was the expedition undertaken by diplomatic Consul [[William Eaton (soldier)|William Eaton]] with the objective of replacing the pasha with an elder brother living in exile, who had promised to accede to all the wishes of the United States. Eaton, at the head of a mixed force of US Soldiers, Sailors, and Marines, along with Greek, Arab and Turkish mercenaries numbering approximately 500, marched across the Egyptian / Libyan desert from [[Alexandria]], [[Egypt]] and with the aid of three American warships, succeeded in [[Battle of Derna (1805)|capturing Derna]]. Soon afterward, on 3 June 1805, peace was concluded. The pasha ended his demands and received $60,000 as ransom for the ''Philadelphia'' prisoners under the [[Treaty with Tripoli (1805)|1805 Treaty with Tripoli]].\n\nIn 1815, in consequence of further outrages and due to the humiliation of the earlier defeat, Captains Bainbridge and [[Stephen Decatur]], at the head of an American squadron, again visited Tripoli and forced the pasha to comply with the demands of the United States. See [[Second Barbary War]].\n\n=== Late Ottoman era ===\n[[File:Ottoman Clock Tower Tripoli.jpg|thumb|200px|right|[[Ottoman era|Ottoman]] [[Clock tower]] in Tripoli's old town medina]]\nIn 1835, the Ottomans took advantage of a local civil war to reassert their direct authority. After that date, Tripoli was under the direct control of the [[Sublime Porte]]. Rebellions in 1842 and 1844 were unsuccessful. After the [[French occupation of Tunisia]] (1881), the Ottomans increased their garrison in Tripoli considerably.{{Clarify|reason=vague|date=September 2015}}\n\n=== Italian era ===\nItaly had long claimed that Tripoli fell within its zone of influence and that Italy had the right to preserve order within the state.<ref>{{cite journal  |author = Charles Wellington Furlong |date=December 1911 |title=The Taking Of Tripoli: What Italy Is Acquiring |journal=[[World's Work|The World's Work: A History of Our Time]] |volume=XXIII |pages=165\u2013176|accessdate=10 July 2009 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Vv--PfedzLAC&pg=PA165|author-link=Charles W.

Locals in Libya must purchase dollars on the black market, rather than receiving dollars on the official rate of 1.37 Dinars to 1 US Dollar, due to Central bank(s) refusal to give US dollars to the public, the current pricing of Dollars amounts to 10 Dinars to 1 US dollar on the black market, driving the local Libyan economy into ruin and undermining local peoples purchasing power. Militias however have been benefiting from this exploit due to their armed influences and corrupt natures by purchasing dollars on the official rate of 1.30 to 1, and selling them US$1 to 10 LYD.\n\n== Architecture ==\n[[File:Tripoli - In der Altstadt 03.jpg|thumb|upright|Tripoli's Old City (El-Madina El-Kadima), situated in the city centre, is one of the classical sites of the Mediterranean and an important tourist attraction.]]\nThe city's old town, the [[Medina quarter|Medina]], is still unspoiled by mass-tourism, though it was increasingly exposed to more and more visitors from abroad, following the lifting of the UN embargo in 2003.

The city walls are still standing and can be climbed for good views of the city. The [[bazaar]] is also known for its traditional ware; fine jewellery and clothes can be found in the local markets.\n\nThere are a number of buildings that were constructed by the Italian colonial rulers and later demolished under Gaddafi. They included the Royal Miramare Theatre, next to the Red Castle, and Tripoli Railway Central Station.\n\n== Culture ==\nThe [[Red Castle Museum]] (''Assaraya al-Hamra''), a vast palace complex with numerous courtyards, dominates the city skyline and is located on the outskirts of the Medina.

The event happened after secular Zintani militias were accused with claims of smuggling drugs, alcohol and illegal items, known to have past ties with the Gaddafi Regime. Libya's Mufti Sadiq al Ghariani has praised the Libya Dawn Operation.\n\nThe result of the Battle for Tripoli's central airport was its complete destruction with 90% of the facilities incapacitated, or burned down with an unknown estimate Billions of dollars in Damage, with another 10 or so planes destroyed. The airport was shelled with [[BM-21 Grad|Grad]] rockets with reports of the [[Air Traffic Control]] tower completely destroyed, including the main reception building completely wrecked. Surrounding civilian residential areas and infrastructure, of which include Bridges, Electricity equipment, water equipment, and roads were also damaged in the fighting. Oil storage tankers containing large reserves of Kerosene fuels, gases and related chemicals were burnt and large plumes of smoke rose into the air.\n\nReconstruction efforts are currently underway with the GNA giving a contract amounting to $78 Million to an Italian firm 'Emaco Group' or \"Aeneas Consorzio\", to rebuild the destroyed facilities.

After performing the Hajj, Abdullah b 'Aamir proceeded to [[Madinah]] to see Uthman. Before Abdullah ibn Aamir reached Medina, Uthman had been martyred. That was a great shock for Abdullah ibn Aamir. When [[Zubayr ibn al-Awwam]], [[Talha]] and [[Aisha|Ayesha]] raised the call for the vengeance for the blood of Uthman from the rebels, Abdullah ibn Aamir suggested them to come with him to Basra because of his greater influence in the city. The confederates succeeded in capturing Basra because of the influence that Abdullah ibn Aamir commanded over the people of Basra. Along with [[Talha]] and [[Zubayr ibn al-Awwam]], Abdullah ibn Aamir arrested and killed around 4000 suspected rebels in connection with the murder of Caliph Uthman.

It is a branch of the '''Public Library of Steubenville and Jefferson County (PLSJ)''', which services a large area in southeast Ohio \u2013 otherwise known as the [[Ohio Valley]].  Besides the Schiappa Library, PLSJ has branches all over [[Jefferson County, Ohio]] located in [[Toronto, Ohio|Toronto]], [[Brilliant, Ohio|Brilliant]], [[Tiltonsville, Ohio|Tiltonsville]], [[Dillonvale, Jefferson County, Ohio|Dillonvale]] and [[Adena, Ohio|Adena]] with the Main Library located in Steubenville.  The Schiappa branch is located at the west end of Steubenville on the [[Fort Steuben Mall]] property.  It not only serves as an additional library for the city of Steubenville, but also as a library for the neighboring village of [[Wintersville, Ohio]].\n\n==History==\n\nThe Schiappa Branch Library opened its doors on February 2, 1987 in the west end of Steubenville, Ohio at 4141 Mall Drive, where it still sits on property donated by the Siciliano family.  This plot of land was one of many looked at in the time leading up to a final decision, but it was this area's location being adjacent to a large [[shopping center]] attracting people from all over the Ohio Valley that made it so desirable.  Huberta Siciliano made it clear that if she donated the land to the library, she would like the facility to be named after her parents: Albert and Mary A. Schiappa.<ref name=\"Lash, John 2005\">Lash, John.  ''The history of the Schiappa Branch Library in Steubenville, Ohio''.  May 2005.</ref>\n\nOne concern with the property that the Schiappa Library now sits upon was that the land was a former [[strip-mining]] area.  This caused many to note that the [[foundation (engineering)|foundation]] would be in danger of cracking and heaving once the [[pyrites]] swelled with moisture.  To resolve this, the library was built upon 110 [[concrete]] [[pylon (disambiguation)|pylons]], drilled to solid rock, which is between 4 and 14 feet deep at the site.<ref name=\"steubenvillelibrary.org\">Hall, Alan.

To remedy this, returned books were shelved quickly and the State Regional Library sent over boxes of books to make the shelves more full temporarily.<ref name=\"steubenvillelibrary.org\"/>   Over the years, the collection of books has grown exponentially to include [[VHS|videotapes]], [[DVDs]], [[CDs]], [[audiobook]]s, [[periodicals]], and [[graphic novels]].\n\n==Renovations==\n\nBy 1990, the collection at Schiappa Branch Library had grown so large that talk of expanding the building had begun.  A larger children's area was needed, more [[Reference#Libraries|reference]] shelving would be required, and the collection in Schiappa's Ohio History and [[Genealogy]] room was beginning to take up more space than the shelves could fit.  There was also talk of adding a conference room, a children's activity room, and offices for the branch manager.  The project went forward in 1992 and the library was renovated with all of the above changes while the building itself stayed open to the public.  An extra wing was added for the children's area and activity room, a conference room and three study rooms were built, offices for the branch manager and extra workspaces were added behind the [[library circulation|Circulation]] desk, and the Reference and Genealogy departments were given their own closed in space for quiet studying and for keeping reference materials from leaving the room.<ref name=\"Lash, John 2005\"/>\n\nBeginning in 2007, plans were drawn up for another renovation project.  This time, it was the front [[lobby (room)|lobby]] and adult fiction/nonfiction areas that would be getting a makeover.  New flooring was put into the front lobby and periodical section.  New furniture was brought in, including new desks, workspaces, chairs and a counter for the Circulation department.  [[Vending machines]] were added beside new study areas for a more modern and customer friendly look.<ref>Hall, Alan.  [http://www.steubenvillelibrary.org/Director/DCdetail.asp?dcID=138 \"Library Cafe\"], ''Herald-Star'', February 24, 2008, retrieved October 20, 2008.</ref>  The project was essentially complete in spring of 2008.\n\n==Departments==\n\n===General circulation===\n\nThe Circulation department is located in the front lobby of the library.  Items may be returned or taken out at the circulation desk.  Borrowers may also pick up items that have been placed on hold (brought in from other libraries).  The [[librarian|library assistants]] at Circulation will help you locate items throughout the building or assist in ordering items that are not currently stocked.  A borrower may also take care of any pending [[Fine (penalty)|overdue fines]] in this department.\n\n===Children/teens===\n\nLocated in the rear of the Schiappa Library, this area includes a listening center for audio books, toys for young ones, couches for parents, a youthful reading area for teens<ref>[http://steubenvillelibrary.org/Services/YoungAdults/index.asp PLSJ Website: YoungAdults]</ref> and several desks for studying and activities.  There is also an activity room used for hosting children's programming and large group activities.\n\n===References===\n\nThe Reference department is mostly for quiet study and Internet usage.  The room is equipped with eight [[computers]] wired to the Internet.  The computers use timed software to allow each borrower up to an hour and twenty minutes of Internet time each day.  The Reference staff will assist in [[technical support]], [[troubleshooting]], and will answer questions both in person and online through the [[Meebo]] chat service.  The Reference librarian will also assist in ordering material not currently in the libraries [[database]].\n\n===Ohio Room/genealogy===\n\nThe Ohio History/Genealogy department is unique to the Schiappa Branch Library.  Nowhere else in the Jefferson County library system will one find this information.  The room is filled with books not only helping with basic genealogy techniques, but also books specific to the Steubenville and Jefferson County region that the library serves.  The collection consists of birth, death and marriage [[record (computer science)|records]], newspaper clippings, [[photo albums]], [[high school]] [[yearbooks]], and United States [[census]] materials, among other things.  There is also a large collection the Steubenville area's local newspaper, [http://www.hsconnect.com The ''Herald-Star''], dating back to the early 19th century on [[microfilm]].  The [[genealogist]] on duty can assist in using these materials as well as the wide variety of [[online]] materials.<ref>[http://steubenvillelibrary.org/Services/History/index.asp PLSJ Website]</ref>\n\n==Services and programs==\n\nThe Schiappa Branch offers many free services, such as [[notary public|public notaries]] on duty during working hours, Internet access, [[Wi-Fi]] availability, and beginner computer instruction.  The library also houses public [[photocopier|copy machines]] and [[computer printer|printers]] for a fee.\n\nThe library offers many programs for people of all ages.  Children can visit the Tot Time, Babygarten, and Story Hour programs.<ref>[http://kids.steubenvillelibrary.com/Events/index.asp PLSJ Kids Webpage].</ref>  Teen programs include bi-monthly [[videogame]] nights<ref>[http://www.myspace.com/plsjgames Schiappa Game Nights MySpace Page]</ref> and an all-ages movie is shown once a month.<ref>[http://www.myspace.com/plsjmovies Schiappa Movie Nights MySpace Page].</ref>  Adult programs vary from month to month,<ref>[http://steubenvillelibrary.org/Events/index.asp PLSJ Events Webpage].</ref> but have \u2013 in the past \u2013 included wine tasting, cooking demonstrations, and author visits.

The government, however, has thus far relied on monetary policy \u2015 increasing access to credit through the central bank and relaxing repayment schedules. This, however, is likely to have only a limited impact for the vast majority of Haitians. Without greater international assistance, it is unlikely the government will have the fiscal resources available to properly support the population throughout the crisis. Price gouging has already started, putting a strain on an already fragile population. This is partly due to the fact that the Haitian food supply depends largely on imports, which are likely to decline during the current situation. While the government has announced measures to ensure food distribution, it must make a priority of protecting consumers from price spikes. This also presents an opportunity to invest in and expand the agricultural sector, which could provide stability for farmers and sellers, and increase national production. It is imperative to recognize that the Haitian state\u2019s inability to adequately respond to the crisis is tied to a legacy of foreign domination, occupation, and exploitation, and to decades of foreign aid policies that have eroded the state\u2019s capacity. Nevertheless, it is increasingly clear, as with the 2010 earthquake, that the Haitian government will not be able to adequately respond to the current crisis without increased support from the international community.<ref name=johnston20/>\n}}\n\nRichard Frechette, a 67-year-old physician and Roman Catholic priest from the United States who is working in Haiti,<ref name=merlo20>{{cite news |last1=Merlo |first1=Francesca |title=Covid-19: Holy Week in poverty-stricken Haiti - Vatican News |url=https://www.vaticannews.va/en/church/news/2020-04/coronavirus-covid19-haiti-holy-week-poverty.html |accessdate=18 April 2020 |work=[[Vatican News]] |date=9 April 2020 |language=en}}</ref> stated in an article published on 9 April 2020 that\n{{quote|\nMy sister in the United States, sheltering in her place, is enjoying swordfish and salmon every night and playing scrabble.

The government, however, has thus far relied on monetary policy \u2015 increasing access to credit through the central bank and relaxing repayment schedules. This, however, is likely to have only a limited impact for the vast majority of Haitians. Without greater international assistance, it is unlikely the government will have the fiscal resources available to properly support the population throughout the crisis. Price gouging has already started, putting a strain on an already fragile population. This is partly due to the fact that the Haitian food supply depends largely on imports, which are likely to decline during the current situation. While the government has announced measures to ensure food distribution, it must make a priority of protecting consumers from price spikes. This also presents an opportunity to invest in and expand the agricultural sector, which could provide stability for farmers and sellers, and increase national production. It is imperative to recognize that the Haitian state\u2019s inability to adequately respond to the crisis is tied to a legacy of foreign domination, occupation, and exploitation, and to decades of foreign aid policies that have eroded the state\u2019s capacity. Nevertheless, it is increasingly clear, as with the 2010 earthquake, that the Haitian government will not be able to adequately respond to the current crisis without increased support from the international community.<ref name=johnston20/>\n}}\n\nRichard Frechette, a 67-year-old physician and Roman Catholic priest from the United States who is working in Haiti,<ref name=merlo20>{{cite news |last1=Merlo |first1=Francesca |title=Covid-19: Holy Week in poverty-stricken Haiti - Vatican News |url=https://www.vaticannews.va/en/church/news/2020-04/coronavirus-covid19-haiti-holy-week-poverty.html |accessdate=18 April 2020 |work=[[Vatican News]] |date=9 April 2020 |language=en}}</ref> stated in an article published on 9 April 2020 that\n{{quote|\nMy sister in the United States, sheltering in her place, is enjoying swordfish and salmon every night and playing scrabble.

His sound based work is concerned with the innate lyricism of his traditional language and the expression of this in contemporary traditional and experimental musical forms.

His sound based work is concerned with the innate lyricism of his traditional language and the expression of this in contemporary traditional and experimental musical forms.
