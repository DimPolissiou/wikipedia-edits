[[Sydney]] and [[Melbourne]] both made representations to the Federal Government for matching dollar for dollar funding for a Universal Exposition in the 1988 bicentennial year, however, citing the costs of the new [[Parliament House, Canberra|Parliament House]] in Canberra, also to be opened in the same year, these proposals were knocked back.<ref>[http://www.foundationexpo88.org/originsofexpocarroll.pdf Origins of Expo] \u2013 Foundation Expo 88</ref>\n\nBrisbane, under Premier Sir [[Joh Bjelke-Petersen]], then developed Maccomick's earlier proposal to host an international-scale exposition, however at no cost to the Australian taxpayer, a world's first 'free enterprise' World Exposition, which the Federal Government rubber stamped.{{Citation needed|date=November 2008}}\n\nWith federal representation, at the December 1983 [[Bureau International des Expositions]] (BIE) General Assembly, Brisbane won the right to hold the 1988 World Exposition, as a specialised international exposition. Immediately, the Brisbane Exposition and South Bank Redevelopment Authority was formed with Sir [[Llewellyn Edwards]], State Deputy Premier, at the helm.

The fair attracted more than 18 million visitors, including staff and VIPs, more than double the predicted 7.8 million, and was considered a turning point in the history of Brisbane, which had recently successfully hosted the [[1982 Commonwealth Games|XIIth Commonwealth Games]] in 1982.

Major western and European nations were represented such as the [[United States]], the [[Soviet Union]] (last representation at a World Exposition), [[France]], [[West Germany]] (also last representation at a World Exposition), the [[United Kingdom]], [[Canada]], [[Spain]] and [[Greece]], as well as major Asian countries such as [[Singapore]], [[Thailand]], [[Nepal]], [[Pakistan]], [[China]], [[Japan]], [[Sri Lanka]], [[South Korea]] and [[Indonesia]], amongst others. Close neighbouring countries, [[New Zealand]] and [[Papua New Guinea]] were also represented.\n\nState-level and multi-lateral organisations included the six Australian states, the [[United Nations]], the [[European Union]], [[Vatican City]], three American states ([[Hawaii]], [[California]] and [[Alaska]]), one Japanese prefecture (sister state of Queensland, [[Saitama Prefecture]]), and one Japanese city (Brisbane's sister city [[Kobe]] City).\n\nCorporate pavilions included [[IBM]], [[Ford]], [[Fujitsu]], [[Queensland Newspapers]], [[Australia Post]], [[Cadbury plc|Cadbury Chocolate]], [[Suncorp]], and the Queensland Teachers Credit Union. [[NASA]] and [[Universal Studios]] hosted outdoor exhibits, with models of the [[space shuttle]] and [[Apollo program]], as well as the car KITT from the TV series ''[[Knight Rider (1982 TV series)|Knight Rider]]''. Also having its own pavilion was the official Australian TV partner of the Expo, [[Network Ten]], via its Queensland station TVQ, whose news studios were located there for public tours and during the Expo also switched channel frequencies in September (from channel 0 to channel 10) in line with the other state channels.\n\nThe most expensive pavilion was Japan (A$26 million), followed by the Queensland Pavilion (A$20 million) and the Australia Pavilion (A$18 million). The largest Pavilions were also Queensland,<ref name=\"show\"/> followed by Australia then Japan.\n\n[[High Definition TV]] received its Australian premiere at the Japan Pavilion, and the text-based [[Internet]] at the [[Switzerland|Swiss]] Pavilion.

There was also a new weekly theme which allowed special-interest groups to entertain.<ref name=\"b150s\"/>\n\nThe logos were used extensively throughout the Expo site as well as souvenirs, and a costume Expo Oz could be seen as part of the daily parades, shows, and other variety performances. Over 500 items of souvenir memorabilia were made using Expo Oz's image. Expo Oz also featured in extensive international tours in the lead-up to the Expo, to Europe, the US and Japan.\n\nThe theme song of the Expo, 'Together We'll Show the World!' by [[Frank Millward]] and [[Carol Lloyd (Australian singer)|Carol Lloyd]],<ref>{{Citation|last=FoundationExpo88|title=Expo 88 Theme song history, part of Expo 88 25 th anniversary, History, 4BC Greg Cary|date=4 May 2013|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jZ-jdCLkY5g|accessdate=17 August 2017}}</ref> was also an important rallying point in promoting the Expo in the lead-up to and during phases of the fair, and captured a sense of the excitement of the Expo.\n\nThe colourful theme for the Australia Pavilion, which became synonymous with the hosting of the Expo with Australia as host nation, was designed by prominent Australian artist [[Ken Done]], and featured huge playful colourful letters making up the word Australia in an Australia Pavilion Entrance set, and Exit set, with the entrance set a stack of nine, 3x3, some 2.1 metres high each, and the exit set, in a line of nine letters, some 5.6 metres high each. These letters became a very popular photo opportunity for the Expo, and the theme was also found on the brightly coloured Australia Pavilion uniforms also.\n\n===Entertainment===\nThe $38 million entertainment program featured acts from all over Australia and the world at a variety of custom-made performance venues on the World Expo 88 site from the 10,000-seat spectacular open-air River Stage (for national day events, opening and closing ceremonies and large-scale events), the 850-seat piazza for circus, marching band, acrobatics, magic and mime, and the smaller-scale amphitheatre for national day ceremonies and laser shows. The River Stage was also the venue for the popular evening fireworks and large-scale laser show, set to music,<ref name=\"b150s\"/> each Expo evening at 10 pm.\n\nBig international and Australian names were a feature at World Expo 88. Perennial Australian favourites such as [[Icehouse (band)|Icehouse]], [[Little River Band]], [[Mental as Anything]], [[The Cockroaches]], [[Joe Camilleri]] and the [[Black Sorrows]], [[John Farnham]], [[Julie Anthony (Australian singer)|Julie Anthony]], [[Simon Gallaher]], [[Wickety Wak]] and [[Jon English]], were regular performers, as well as concerts by international artists such as [[Jerry Harrison]] (of [[Talking Heads]]), [[Julio Iglesias]], [[John Denver]], [[Donny Osmond]], [[Cher]], [[Phyllis Diller]], and a wide variety of international theatre, opera, and classical music at the adjoining (separate ticket admission) World Expo on Stage program at the [[Queensland Performing Arts Complex]].\n\nThe exposition averaged 100,000 visitors a day, with highest day of attendance being 184,000 visitors on 29 October 1988, the last day before the closing ceremony.\n\nAt the closing ceremony of World Expo 88 at the River Stage, a concert showcased all the Expo's entertainers singing and dancing. The concert finished up with the [[Australia]]n [[pop-folk]] band, [[The Seekers]], singing one of their songs \"''[[The Carnival Is Over]]''\" at the very end of the celebrations, in what has become an Australian tradition. As Judith Durham was not available to join the other Seekers for the Expo '88 Closing Ceremony celebrations, Australian soprano [[Julie Anthony (Australian singer)|Julie Anthony]] joined the group as the lead vocalist in her stead. During the events of the Expo's closing ceremony, the Night Companion's light beam was stilled.  Sir Llewellyn Edwards concluded the Expo with the words \"With the Prime Minister, Mr Premier, my Lord Mayor, distinguished guests, and ladies and gentlemen \u2013 as the Prime Minister indicated, the carnival is now over, Expo '88 has come to a close.....Thank you for all that have contributed and may the light of World Expo 88 never really fade.\" .<ref>{{cite web | title = Academic Forum, Foundation Expo '88 | publisher = Foundation Expo '88 | date = 15 November 2010 | url = http://www.foundationexpo88.org/closingceremonyspeechthehonourablesirllewedwardschairmanofworldexpo88.html | accessdate = 15 November 2010 }}</ref>\nA massive fireworks display, the longest in Australia at the time,<ref name=\"show\"/> soon followed, with a burning icon of the World Expo 88 sun sails logo set alight on the Brisbane River.\n\n==Legacy==\n\n===The Nepal Peace Pagoda and South Bank Parklands===\n[[File:Nepalesepavilionbrisbane.JPG|thumb|upright|The [[Nepal Peace Pagoda]] in [[South Bank Parklands]]]]\nAfter the end of World Expo 88, various contingency plans were mooted as to possible future developments. One proposal was for a second central business district area to be developed, however this proposal was rejected. A second proposal, incorporating extensive parklands, boutique retail, as well as low-medium residential development, was later accepted, and four years after the closure of World Expo 88, the site was reopened as [[South Bank Parklands]], which is managed by the [[South Bank Corporation]], a State Government corporation.\n\nThe only remaining trace of the Exposition on the former site is the [[Nepal Peace Pagoda]], part of the Nepalese representation, a traditional three-storey handmade wooden replica of a Pagoda in Kathmandu. The popular Boardwalk eateries from Expo made way for more parklands and upmarket restaurants in 2011.\n\n===Riverstage and the Courier Mail Piazza===\nTwo of the most popular performing arts venues from World Expo 88 took on a new form at the conclusion of the Expo as [[Riverstage]] (at the new venue in the [[City Botanic Gardens]]), and the [[Courier Mail Piazza]] (formerly called the Suncorp Piazza) at the [[South Bank Parklands]]. These two outdoor performing arts venues today welcome visitors to a variety of performing arts genres.\n\n===The Skyneedle===\n[[File:Expo-88-skyneedle-and-monorail.jpg|thumb|upright|The Skyneedle at World Expo '88]]\n[[The Skyneedle, Brisbane|The Skyneedle]] (or \"Night Companion\") is {{convert|88|m|ft|abbr=on}}-high and beams light skywards with a visibility of more than {{convert|60|km|mi|abbr=on}} during special events.\n\nThe Skyneedle, which was originally built for World Expo 88, was to be relocated to [[Tokyo Disneyland]] after the Expo.

Also the 100-strong plaster of paris 'Human Factor' sculpture series which captured the whimsy of persons in day-to-day life, were also put up for private sale, with many of them being purchased for shopping centres and arcades. Some of the works that were for sale have been purchased by the [[Brisbane City Council]] and are on display at various places in the city today. Most notably, one can find [[Gidon Graetz]]'s work 'Mirage' in the [[Brisbane Arcade]], and American sculptor [[Jon Barlow Hudson]]'s work \"Morning Star II\", located in the [[City Botanic Gardens]]. A sectional model or [[maquette]] of Jon Barlow Hudson's artwork 'Paradigm' is on display outside [[State Library of Queensland]].<ref>{{cite web | title = State Library unveils model Expo 88 sculpture by international artist | publisher = State Library of Queensland | date = 3 June 2015 | url = http://blogs.slq.qld.gov.au/slq-today/2015/06/03/state-library-unveils-model-expo-88-sculpture-by-international-artist | accessdate = 17 February 2016 }}</ref>\n\nOne can view and take part in a Heritage Walk of some of the major works at the World Expo 88 Art Heritage trail at Celebrate 88.<ref>[http://www.celebrate88.com/abouttrail.html About the Trail] \u2013 Celebrate 88</ref>\n\n===The Japan Pond and Garden===\nThe [[Japan]] Pond and Garden from the Japanese Government Pavilion was gifted to the [[City of Brisbane]] at the end of the Expo and was re-located to the [[Brisbane Botanic Gardens, Mount Coot-tha|Mount Coot-tha Botanic Gardens]].\n\n===Australia Pavilion letters===\nThe colourful, large Australia Pavilion letters, designed by Australian artist [[Ken Done]] were synonymous with the success of the Expo, and were purchased by Shaftesbury Citizenship Campus at the end of the Expo, for their [[Burpengary, Queensland|Burpengary]] Campus. The end of Expo till 2008 the letters could be viewed along the [[Bruce Highway]] near Burpengary as one approached Brisbane City, a reminder of their successful role at World Expo 88. In 2018, the letters were restored and placed at the Caboolture Historical Village.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.historicalvillage.com.au/expo-88-signs/|title=Expo 88 Australia Signs \u2013 Story and Photos of the Restoration|website=Caboolture Historical Village}}</ref>\n\n===World Expo Park \u2013 Brisbane Convention & Exhibition Centre===\n[[World Expo Park]], the Expo's theme park located adjacent to the Expo site, was intended to be a permanent legacy of the Expo at its conclusion. Citing lack of patronage, however, it closed down just a year after the Expo closed its doors. The site of World Expo Park was re-developed into the [[Brisbane Convention & Exhibition Centre]].\n\n===Queensland Pavilion===\nThe Queensland Pavilion was purchased by the Gateway Baptist Church, and now stands on their [[Mackenzie, Queensland|Mackenzie]] premises.\n\n===Foundation===\nOn 30 April 2004, sixteen years after World Expo 88's official opening, a non-government not-for-profit commemorative foundation for the Exposition was launched, named Foundation Expo '88, consisting of a commemorative website, association and museum. The Association, The Friends of the Pagoda Association, bases its activities at the [[Nepal Peace Pagoda]] from the Expo, which houses at the Pagoda first level a commemorative Museum display of memorabilia from Expo.\n\nFor the 10th Anniversary of Foundation Expo '88 in 2014, the Foundation, Association and Museum were re-branded into one new entity \"Celebrate 88!\".\n\n=== Expo Gold ===\nThe Golden Penda tree (''[[Xanthostemon chrysanthus]])'' was selected as the theme plant for Expo 88. Cuttings of the tree, which is native to north Queensland, were taken from a superior form from a garden in Brisbane and planted in flower in Brisbane to create a 'Sea of Gold'. In late autumn, the tree can still be seen in flower in gardens and lining streets across Brisbane.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://anpsa.org.au/APOL30/jun03-14.html|title=Growing Golden Penda|website=Association of Societies for Growing Australian Plants|access-date=5 June 2017}}</ref> The tree is also the native floral emblem of Cairns.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.sgapcairns.org.au/PlantsEmblemsXanChr.html|title=Floral Emblem of Cairns City|website=The Cairns Branch of the Society for Growing Australian Plants (SGAP)|access-date=6 June 2017}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.cairns.qld.gov.au/region/city-symbols|title=City symbols|last=Council|first=Cairns Regional|date=27 May 2016|website=Cairns Regional Council|language=en-AU|access-date=2019-11-30}}</ref>\n\n=== Q150 Icon ===\nIn 2009 as part of the [[Q150]] celebrations, Expo 88 was announced as one of the [[Q150 Icons]] of Queensland for its role as a \"Defining Moment\".<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://statements.qld.gov.au/statement/id/64301|title=PREMIER UNVEILS QUEENSLAND\u2019S 150 ICONS|last=Bligh|first=Anna|authorlink=Anna Bligh|date=10 June 2009|publisher=[[Queensland Government]]|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170524033717/http://statements.qld.gov.au/statement/id/64301|archive-date=24 May 2017|url-status=|access-date=24 May 2017}}</ref>\n\n==20th Anniversary Celebrations==\nCelebrations for the 20th Anniversary of World Expo 88 were held at [[South Bank Parklands]] during May 2008.

[[Sydney]] and [[Melbourne]] both made representations to the Federal Government for matching dollar for dollar funding for a Universal Exposition in the 1988 bicentennial year, however, citing the costs of the new [[Parliament House, Canberra|Parliament House]] in Canberra, also to be opened in the same year, these proposals were knocked back.<ref>[http://www.foundationexpo88.org/originsofexpocarroll.pdf Origins of Expo] \u2013 Foundation Expo 88</ref>\n\nBrisbane, under Premier Sir [[Joh Bjelke-Petersen]], then developed Maccomick's earlier proposal to host an international-scale exposition, however at no cost to the Australian taxpayer, a world's first 'free enterprise' World Exposition, which the Federal Government rubber stamped.{{Citation needed|date=November 2008}}\n\nWith federal representation, at the December 1983 [[Bureau International des Expositions]] (BIE) General Assembly, Brisbane won the right to hold the 1988 World Exposition, as a specialised international exposition. Immediately, the Brisbane Exposition and South Bank Redevelopment Authority was formed with Sir [[Llewellyn Edwards]], State Deputy Premier, at the helm.

The largest Pavilions were also Queensland,<ref name=\"show\"/> followed by Australia then Japan.\n\n[[High Definition TV]] received its Australian premiere at the Japan Pavilion, and the text-based [[Internet]] at the [[Switzerland|Swiss]] Pavilion. At the University pavilion the world's longest lab experiment was on display. The [[pitch drop experiment]], which features tar pitch slowly dripping through a funnel at a rate of nine drops in 81 years, actually made an unseen drop while on display.<ref>{{Cite news |url=http://www.brisbanetimes.com.au/queensland/worlds-longest-lab-experiment-a-lesson-in-persistence-20120119-1q7lu.html |title=World's longest lab experiment a lesson in persistence |author=Dan Nancarrow |accessdate=23 January 2012 |date=20 January 2012 |work=Brisbane Times |publisher=Fairfax Media }}</ref>\n\nThe most popular pavilion was [[New Zealand]]<ref>{{cite web|last=McGregor|first=John|title=The New Zealand Pavilion, World Expo '88, Brisbane|url=http://www.foundationexpo88.org/pavilions/international/newzealand.html|accessdate=26 May 2012}}</ref> with its animated [[Footrot Flats]] show and glow worm cave followed by [[Australia]], with its special effects 'Dreamtime Theatre'; [[Queensland]], with its popular 180-metre long people mover ride through Queensland of the present and the future; Japan with its [[Brisbane Botanic Gardens, Mount Coot-tha#Japanese Garden|Japan Pond and Garden]] and hi-tech displays; [[Switzerland]], with its artificial snow ski slope and cable car ride; and [[Nepal]], with its 3-level hand-crafted [[Nepal Peace Pagoda]].\n\n===Architecture===\nFor the most part, pavilions were housed in pre-fabricated units constructed by the expo authority, with the exception of the [[Nepal Peace Pagoda]], of [[Nepal]], and aspects of the [[Kingdom of Thailand]] Pavilion, amongst others. The Australia Pavilion and Queensland Pavilion, side by side, were also custom-made, with the exterior of the Australia Pavilion notably in the shape and colours of [[Uluru]] (Ayers Rock). The Queensland Pavilion was designed by Robin Gibson.<ref name=\"show\"/>\n\n===Theming===\n[[File:World-Expo-88-Logo.JPG|thumb|left|Sunsails logo and World Expo '88 sign at night]]\n{{multiple image\n | align =  center\n | footer = World Expo '88 Logos\n | footer_align = center\n | image1 = Expo88catologo.jpg\n | width1 = 162\n | alt1 = World Expo '88 Sunsails Logo\n | caption1 = Sunsails Logo\n | image2 = Expo 88 Globe logo.JPG\n | width2 = 73\n | alt2 = World Expo '88 Globe Logo\n | caption2 = Globe Logo\n }}\n[[File:Expoozworldexpo88.jpg|thumb|upright|The Australian [[Platypus]] Expo Oz was a part of the success of the Expo]]\nAs well as the popular platypus mascot Expo Oz, designed by Disney's Imagineering Division, there were several themed initiatives that promoted World Expo 88, most notably the Expo's two interchangeable brands (as noted above): one an boomerang-styled '88' on a wire frame globe, and the colourful sunsails logo, which superimposed aspects of the Expo's entertainment on a relief of one of the Expo's popular sun sails (designed by Ken Cato, of Cato Purnell Partners). There was also a new weekly theme which allowed special-interest groups to entertain.<ref name=\"b150s\"/>\n\nThe logos were used extensively throughout the Expo site as well as souvenirs, and a costume Expo Oz could be seen as part of the daily parades, shows, and other variety performances. Over 500 items of souvenir memorabilia were made using Expo Oz's image. Expo Oz also featured in extensive international tours in the lead-up to the Expo, to Europe, the US and Japan.\n\nThe theme song of the Expo, 'Together We'll Show the World!' by [[Frank Millward]] and [[Carol Lloyd (Australian singer)|Carol Lloyd]],<ref>{{Citation|last=FoundationExpo88|title=Expo 88 Theme song history, part of Expo 88 25 th anniversary, History, 4BC Greg Cary|date=4 May 2013|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jZ-jdCLkY5g|accessdate=17 August 2017}}</ref> was also an important rallying point in promoting the Expo in the lead-up to and during phases of the fair, and captured a sense of the excitement of the Expo.\n\nThe colourful theme for the Australia Pavilion, which became synonymous with the hosting of the Expo with Australia as host nation, was designed by prominent Australian artist [[Ken Done]], and featured huge playful colourful letters making up the word Australia in an Australia Pavilion Entrance set, and Exit set, with the entrance set a stack of nine, 3x3, some 2.1 metres high each, and the exit set, in a line of nine letters, some 5.6 metres high each. These letters became a very popular photo opportunity for the Expo, and the theme was also found on the brightly coloured Australia Pavilion uniforms also.\n\n===Entertainment===\nThe $38 million entertainment program featured acts from all over Australia and the world at a variety of custom-made performance venues on the World Expo 88 site from the 10,000-seat spectacular open-air River Stage (for national day events, opening and closing ceremonies and large-scale events), the 850-seat piazza for circus, marching band, acrobatics, magic and mime, and the smaller-scale amphitheatre for national day ceremonies and laser shows. The River Stage was also the venue for the popular evening fireworks and large-scale laser show, set to music,<ref name=\"b150s\"/> each Expo evening at 10 pm.\n\nBig international and Australian names were a feature at World Expo 88. Perennial Australian favourites such as [[Icehouse (band)|Icehouse]], [[Little River Band]], [[Mental as Anything]], [[The Cockroaches]], [[Joe Camilleri]] and the [[Black Sorrows]], [[John Farnham]], [[Julie Anthony (Australian singer)|Julie Anthony]], [[Simon Gallaher]], [[Wickety Wak]] and [[Jon English]], were regular performers, as well as concerts by international artists such as [[Jerry Harrison]] (of [[Talking Heads]]), [[Julio Iglesias]], [[John Denver]], [[Donny Osmond]], [[Cher]], [[Phyllis Diller]], and a wide variety of international theatre, opera, and classical music at the adjoining (separate ticket admission) World Expo on Stage program at the [[Queensland Performing Arts Complex]].\n\nThe exposition averaged 100,000 visitors a day, with highest day of attendance being 184,000 visitors on 29 October 1988, the last day before the closing ceremony.\n\nAt the closing ceremony of World Expo 88 at the River Stage, a concert showcased all the Expo's entertainers singing and dancing. The concert finished up with the [[Australia]]n [[pop-folk]] band, [[The Seekers]], singing one of their songs \"''[[The Carnival Is Over]]''\" at the very end of the celebrations, in what has become an Australian tradition. As Judith Durham was not available to join the other Seekers for the Expo '88 Closing Ceremony celebrations, Australian soprano [[Julie Anthony (Australian singer)|Julie Anthony]] joined the group as the lead vocalist in her stead. During the events of the Expo's closing ceremony, the Night Companion's light beam was stilled.  Sir Llewellyn Edwards concluded the Expo with the words \"With the Prime Minister, Mr Premier, my Lord Mayor, distinguished guests, and ladies and gentlemen \u2013 as the Prime Minister indicated, the carnival is now over, Expo '88 has come to a close.....Thank you for all that have contributed and may the light of World Expo 88 never really fade.\" .<ref>{{cite web | title = Academic Forum, Foundation Expo '88 | publisher = Foundation Expo '88 | date = 15 November 2010 | url = http://www.foundationexpo88.org/closingceremonyspeechthehonourablesirllewedwardschairmanofworldexpo88.html | accessdate = 15 November 2010 }}</ref>\nA massive fireworks display, the longest in Australia at the time,<ref name=\"show\"/> soon followed, with a burning icon of the World Expo 88 sun sails logo set alight on the Brisbane River.\n\n==Legacy==\n\n===The Nepal Peace Pagoda and South Bank Parklands===\n[[File:Nepalesepavilionbrisbane.JPG|thumb|upright|The [[Nepal Peace Pagoda]] in [[South Bank Parklands]]]]\nAfter the end of World Expo 88, various contingency plans were mooted as to possible future developments. One proposal was for a second central business district area to be developed, however this proposal was rejected. A second proposal, incorporating extensive parklands, boutique retail, as well as low-medium residential development, was later accepted, and four years after the closure of World Expo 88, the site was reopened as [[South Bank Parklands]], which is managed by the [[South Bank Corporation]], a State Government corporation.\n\nThe only remaining trace of the Exposition on the former site is the [[Nepal Peace Pagoda]], part of the Nepalese representation, a traditional three-storey handmade wooden replica of a Pagoda in Kathmandu. The popular Boardwalk eateries from Expo made way for more parklands and upmarket restaurants in 2011.\n\n===Riverstage and the Courier Mail Piazza===\nTwo of the most popular performing arts venues from World Expo 88 took on a new form at the conclusion of the Expo as [[Riverstage]] (at the new venue in the [[City Botanic Gardens]]), and the [[Courier Mail Piazza]] (formerly called the Suncorp Piazza) at the [[South Bank Parklands]]. These two outdoor performing arts venues today welcome visitors to a variety of performing arts genres.\n\n===The Skyneedle===\n[[File:Expo-88-skyneedle-and-monorail.jpg|thumb|upright|The Skyneedle at World Expo '88]]\n[[The Skyneedle, Brisbane|The Skyneedle]] (or \"Night Companion\") is {{convert|88|m|ft|abbr=on}}-high and beams light skywards with a visibility of more than {{convert|60|km|mi|abbr=on}} during special events.\n\nThe Skyneedle, which was originally built for World Expo 88, was to be relocated to [[Tokyo Disneyland]] after the Expo.

Also the 100-strong plaster of paris 'Human Factor' sculpture series which captured the whimsy of persons in day-to-day life, were also put up for private sale, with many of them being purchased for shopping centres and arcades. Some of the works that were for sale have been purchased by the [[Brisbane City Council]] and are on display at various places in the city today. Most notably, one can find [[Gidon Graetz]]'s work 'Mirage' in the [[Brisbane Arcade]], and American sculptor [[Jon Barlow Hudson]]'s work \"Morning Star II\", located in the [[City Botanic Gardens]]. A sectional model or [[maquette]] of Jon Barlow Hudson's artwork 'Paradigm' is on display outside [[State Library of Queensland]].<ref>{{cite web | title = State Library unveils model Expo 88 sculpture by international artist | publisher = State Library of Queensland | date = 3 June 2015 | url = http://blogs.slq.qld.gov.au/slq-today/2015/06/03/state-library-unveils-model-expo-88-sculpture-by-international-artist | accessdate = 17 February 2016 }}</ref>\n\nOne can view and take part in a Heritage Walk of some of the major works at the World Expo 88 Art Heritage trail at Celebrate 88.<ref>[http://www.celebrate88.com/abouttrail.html About the Trail] \u2013 Celebrate 88</ref>\n\n===The Japan Pond and Garden===\nThe [[Japan]] Pond and Garden from the Japanese Government Pavilion was gifted to the [[City of Brisbane]] at the end of the Expo and was re-located to the [[Brisbane Botanic Gardens, Mount Coot-tha|Mount Coot-tha Botanic Gardens]].\n\n===Australia Pavilion letters===\nThe colourful, large Australia Pavilion letters, designed by Australian artist [[Ken Done]] were synonymous with the success of the Expo, and were purchased by Shaftesbury Citizenship Campus at the end of the Expo, for their [[Burpengary, Queensland|Burpengary]] Campus. The end of Expo till 2008 the letters could be viewed along the [[Bruce Highway]] near Burpengary as one approached Brisbane City, a reminder of their successful role at World Expo 88. In 2018, the letters were restored and placed at the Caboolture Historical Village.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.historicalvillage.com.au/expo-88-signs/|title=Expo 88 Australia Signs \u2013 Story and Photos of the Restoration|website=Caboolture Historical Village}}</ref>\n\n===World Expo Park \u2013 Brisbane Convention & Exhibition Centre===\n[[World Expo Park]], the Expo's theme park located adjacent to the Expo site, was intended to be a permanent legacy of the Expo at its conclusion. Citing lack of patronage, however, it closed down just a year after the Expo closed its doors. The site of World Expo Park was re-developed into the [[Brisbane Convention & Exhibition Centre]].\n\n===Queensland Pavilion===\nThe Queensland Pavilion was purchased by the Gateway Baptist Church, and now stands on their [[Mackenzie, Queensland|Mackenzie]] premises.\n\n===Foundation===\nOn 30 April 2004, sixteen years after World Expo 88's official opening, a non-government not-for-profit commemorative foundation for the Exposition was launched, named Foundation Expo '88, consisting of a commemorative website, association and museum. The Association, The Friends of the Pagoda Association, bases its activities at the [[Nepal Peace Pagoda]] from the Expo, which houses at the Pagoda first level a commemorative Museum display of memorabilia from Expo.\n\nFor the 10th Anniversary of Foundation Expo '88 in 2014, the Foundation, Association and Museum were re-branded into one new entity \"Celebrate 88!\".\n\n=== Expo Gold ===\nThe Golden Penda tree (''[[Xanthostemon chrysanthus]])'' was selected as the theme plant for Expo 88. Cuttings of the tree, which is native to north Queensland, were taken from a superior form from a garden in Brisbane and planted in flower in Brisbane to create a 'Sea of Gold'. In late autumn, the tree can still be seen in flower in gardens and lining streets across Brisbane.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://anpsa.org.au/APOL30/jun03-14.html|title=Growing Golden Penda|website=Association of Societies for Growing Australian Plants|access-date=5 June 2017}}</ref> The tree is also the native floral emblem of Cairns.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.sgapcairns.org.au/PlantsEmblemsXanChr.html|title=Floral Emblem of Cairns City|website=The Cairns Branch of the Society for Growing Australian Plants (SGAP)|access-date=6 June 2017}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.cairns.qld.gov.au/region/city-symbols|title=City symbols|last=Council|first=Cairns Regional|date=27 May 2016|website=Cairns Regional Council|language=en-AU|access-date=2019-11-30}}</ref>\n\n=== Q150 Icon ===\nIn 2009 as part of the [[Q150]] celebrations, Expo 88 was announced as one of the [[Q150 Icons]] of Queensland for its role as a \"Defining Moment\".<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://statements.qld.gov.au/statement/id/64301|title=PREMIER UNVEILS QUEENSLAND\u2019S 150 ICONS|last=Bligh|first=Anna|authorlink=Anna Bligh|date=10 June 2009|publisher=[[Queensland Government]]|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170524033717/http://statements.qld.gov.au/statement/id/64301|archive-date=24 May 2017|url-status=|access-date=24 May 2017}}</ref>\n\n==20th Anniversary Celebrations==\nCelebrations for the 20th Anniversary of World Expo 88 were held at [[South Bank Parklands]] during May 2008.

{"title_page": "Bernhard Reichenbach", "text_new": "{{refimprove|date=February 2017}}\n'''Bernhard Reichenbach''' (1888 in [[Berlin]] \u2013 1975 in [[London]]) was a member of the Executive Committee of the [[Communist International]]. He was a member of the [[Communist Workers' Party of Germany]] and acted as their delegate to the Third Congress of the [[Third International]].\n\nHe was born in Berlin in 1888, the son of Bruno Reichenbach. His younger brother, [[Hans Reichenbach]] would go on to become a leading [[philosopher of science]]. \n\nBernhard was a [[conscientious objector]] but felt it was his duty to serve his country. He therefore volunteered for the medical corps and served in the German army during the [[First World War]] between 1915\u20131917. His time in the medical corps saw him serve at the [[Battle of Verdun]].

When Vellejo was critical of Bradshaw's work, and swatted Bradshaw with the flat of his sword, Bradshaw struck back with a picket, and knocked the captain to the ground. Fearing the consequences, Bradshaw fled to the [[Sacramento Valley]].<ref>Johnston, p. 12-13.</ref><ref>Bell, p. 303-304.</ref>\n\n==Places named for the Bradshaw brothers==\nTraditionally, it has been assumed that the following places were named in recognition of William Bradshaw.  Some historians have proposed that Bradshaw City, and the Bradshaw Mountains, were named for Isaac \"Ike\" Bradshaw, William's brother.  [[Roscoe G.

The college comprises fivd schools: the School of Arts and Sciences, the Bill and Vieve Gore School of Business, the School of Education, the School of Nursing and Health Sciences and the Honors College.  It is the only accredited liberal arts college in the state of Utah.\n\n==History==\n\nThe school was founded in 1875 as the '''Salt Lake Collegiate Institute''', a [[University-preparatory school|prep school]] under the supervision of the First [[Presbyterian]] Church of Salt Lake City.\n\nCollege level classes were first offered in 1897 as '''Sheldon Jackson College'''.  It was given that name after a Presbyterian minister and its primary benefactor, [[Sheldon Jackson]]. High school level classes ceased to be offered in 1945, and the school become strictly a college. Westminster was the first [[School accreditation|accredit]]ed two-year [[junior college]] in Utah. It became a liberal arts institution in 1949.\n\nThe college changed its name to Westminster College in 1902 to better reflect a more general Protestant education.  The name is derived from the [[Westminster Confession of Faith]], a Presbyterian confession of faith, which, in turn, was named for [[Westminster|the district of London]] where it was devised. The [[University of Westminster]], [[London]] is a separate higher education institution in the [[United Kingdom]] and is not affiliated with Westminster College.\n\nStudents from all religions (or none) are welcome, as Westminster severed its official ties to the Presbyterian church in 1974, although it is still loosely affiliated with the [[Presbyterian Church (USA)]]. The college is also no longer antagonistic toward The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. About 37 percent of its students are LDS. The school administration proposed abandoning its traditional crest emblem, a shield emblazoned with the term ''Pro Christo et Libertate'' (\"For Christ and Liberty\").  After students actively protested, the school crest was preserved; in 2007, however, it was abandoned when the new crest with an image of [[Converse Hall]] took its place.\n\n==Campus==\nOriginally located in downtown Salt Lake City, the college moved to its present campus on {{convert|27|acre|ha sqmi|2}} in the Sugar House neighborhood of the city in 1911 where it is still located today.<ref>[http://www.westminstercollege.edu/about/?parent=8905&detail=10048 About Us | Westminster College | Salt Lake City, Utah<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> Emigration Creek runs through the campus.\n\nOn campus are two gyms each equipped with a basketball court, weight room, and studio.\n\nThe larger of the buildings, the Eccles Health Wellness and Athletics Center (HWAC), also has an indoor pool, three story rock climbing wall, and racket ball court.\n\nAs Westminster College is located on little acreage in the heart of Salt Lake City, administration has had to be careful and smart about the growing student population. The sixteenth president of Westminster College, Dr. Michael S. Bassis, saw a need for growing into and connecting with the Sugar House community. During his presidency he acquired Garfield School to the east, with plans on converting it into a center for the arts. However, it was sold to the Elizabeth Academy, a private Montessori school in February 2017.\n\nDr. Bassis also struck a deal to have Westminster on the Draw built on 1300 East, directly across the street from [[Sugar House Park]]. This space has many uses. At seven floors, the bottom level is used as academic and event space. The second floor (street level) is used as business space. While the remaining floors are used as housing for upper-classmen and graduate students.\n\n==Administration==\nWestminster College has had nineteen presidents since its founding; the current president, Dr. Bethami Dobkin, was appointed in July 2018.<ref>{{Cite web |first=William |last=Trojan |date=June 21, 2015 | title = Westminster Announces New President and Board of Trustees Members | publisher = UtahPulse.com | url = http://utahpulse.com/index.php/features/business/2353-westminster-announces-new-president-and-board-of-trustees-members | accessdate = June 22, 2015}}</ref>\nIt has an endowment of $46.1 million as of October 2018.<ref name=\"endowment\" />\n\n==Academics==\nWestminster College comprises fivd schools: the School of Arts and Sciences, the Bill and Vieve Gore School of Business, the School of Education, the School of Nursing and Health Sciences, and the Hobors College. The college operates on a fall and spring semester system with a mini term in May and eight- and twelve-week summer terms.\n\nWestminster offers 34 undergraduate majors conferring BA and BS degrees, which do not include its pre-med, pre-law, and pre-dental programs. In addition to a number of post-baccalaureate certificate programs in various fields, Westminster also offers 13 graduate degrees: Master of Business Administration (MBA), Master of Business Administration in Technology Commercialization (MBATC), Master of Accountancy (MAcc), Master of Arts in Community Leadership (MACL), Master of Arts in Teaching (MAT), Master of Education (MEd), Master of Public Health (MPH), Master of Science in Nursing (MSN), Master of Science in Nursing Education (MSNEd), Master of Science in Nurse Anesthesia (MSNA), Master of Professional Communication (MPC), Master of Strategic Communication (MSC), and Master of Science in Clinical Mental Health Counseling (MSMHC).<ref name=\"http\" />\n\nWestminster College recently launched a new program within the Gore School of Business focusing on training students to be entrepreneurs. The Center for New Enterprise will offer graduate and undergraduate degrees as well as community education programs in entrepreneurship.\n\nWestminster College is accredited by the [[Northwest Commission on Colleges and Universities]]. Programs throughout the college are accredited as well.<ref name=\"http\" />\n\n===Recognition===\n\nWestminster College is the only private, non-denominational, comprehensive liberal arts college in Utah. Admissions statistics advertise a student-faculty ratio of 9:1.

There is also a nationally recognized literary journal known as ''Ellipsis''.  The ''Estonian,'' Westminster's student [[yearbook]], was last published in 1987.\n\n==Athletics==\n{{main|Westminster Griffins}}\nWestminster College teams, nicknamed athletically as the Griffins, are active members of [[National Collegiate Athletic Association|NCAA]] [[NCAA Division II|Division II]] and the [[Rocky Mountain Athletic Conference]] (RMAC). NCAA Division II Men's sports include basketball, cross country, golf, lacrosse, skiing, soccer and track & field; while women's sports include basketball, cross country, golf, lacrosse, skiing, soccer, track & field and volleyball. The Griffins men's and women's alpine skiing teams compete in the Rocky Mountain Intercollegiate Ski Association (RMISA) affiliated with the NCAA. Current non-NCAA sports include cheer, cycling, dance, men's soccer (club) and snowboard.\n\nPrior to 1979, Westminster College athletic teams were called the Parsons, and the school was a member of the Rocky Mountain Athletic Conference (RMAC), which was a member of the [[National Association of Intercollegiate Athletics|NAIA]] at the time. The school joined said conference in the 1967\u201368 academic year. Football, basketball, and other team sports were offered at the intercollegiate level. That year, however, a financial crisis at the school caused it to discontinue its intercollegiate athletic program. Beginning in the 1990s, Westminster gradually began to restore an intercollegiate athletic program.\n\n==Notable alumni==\n<!-- in general people should only be included if they are notable enough to have their own wiki article -->\n*[[Maddie Bowman]] \u2013 freestyle skier<ref>{{cite web|title=Maddie Bowman|url=http://www.teamusa.org/Athletes/BO/Maddie-Bowman|publisher=United States Olympic Committee|accessdate=23 April 2014}}</ref>\n*Ray Bradford (2007) \u2013 Forbes \"30 Under 30\" honoree, 2012<ref>Forbes (2012). \"[https://www.forbes.com/special-report/2012/30-under-30/30-under-30_finance.html 30 Under 30 Finance]\".

The college comprises four schools: the School of Arts and Sciences, the Bill and Vieve Gore School of Business, the School of Education, and the School of Nursing and Health Sciences.  It is the only accredited liberal arts college in the state of Utah.\n\n==History==\n\nThe school was founded in 1875 as the '''Salt Lake Collegiate Institute''', a [[University-preparatory school|prep school]] under the supervision of the First [[Presbyterian]] Church of Salt Lake City.\n\nCollege level classes were first offered in 1897 as '''Sheldon Jackson College'''.  It was given that name after a Presbyterian minister and its primary benefactor, [[Sheldon Jackson]]. High school level classes ceased to be offered in 1945, and the school become strictly a college. Westminster was the first [[School accreditation|accredit]]ed two-year [[junior college]] in Utah. It became a liberal arts institution in 1949.\n\nThe college changed its name to Westminster College in 1902 to better reflect a more general Protestant education.  The name is derived from the [[Westminster Confession of Faith]], a Presbyterian confession of faith, which, in turn, was named for [[Westminster|the district of London]] where it was devised. The [[University of Westminster]], [[London]] is a separate higher education institution in the [[United Kingdom]] and is not affiliated with Westminster College.\n\nStudents from all religions (or none) are welcome, as Westminster severed its official ties to the Presbyterian church in 1974, although it is still loosely affiliated with the [[Presbyterian Church (USA)]]. The college is also no longer antagonistic toward The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. About 37 percent of its students are LDS. The school administration proposed abandoning its traditional crest emblem, a shield emblazoned with the term ''Pro Christo et Libertate'' (\"For Christ and Liberty\").  After students actively protested, the school crest was preserved; in 2007, however, it was abandoned when the new crest with an image of [[Converse Hall]] took its place.\n\n==Campus==\nOriginally located in downtown Salt Lake City, the college moved to its present campus on {{convert|27|acre|ha sqmi|2}} in the Sugar House neighborhood of the city in 1911 where it is still located today.<ref>[http://www.westminstercollege.edu/about/?parent=8905&detail=10048 About Us | Westminster College | Salt Lake City, Utah<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> Emigration Creek runs through the campus.\n\nOn campus are two gyms each equipped with a basketball court, weight room, and studio.\n\nThe larger of the buildings, the Eccles Health Wellness and Athletics Center (HWAC), also has an indoor pool, three story rock climbing wall, and racket ball court.\n\nAs Westminster College is located on little acreage in the heart of Salt Lake City, administration has had to be careful and smart about the growing student population. The sixteenth president of Westminster College, Dr. Michael S. Bassis, saw a need for growing into and connecting with the Sugar House community. During his presidency he acquired Garfield School to the east, with plans on converting it into a center for the arts. However, it was sold to the Elizabeth Academy, a private Montessori school in February 2017.\n\nDr. Bassis also struck a deal to have Westminster on the Draw built on 1300 East, directly across the street from [[Sugar House Park]]. This space has many uses. At seven floors, the bottom level is used as academic and event space. The second floor (street level) is used as business space. While the remaining floors are used as housing for upper-classmen and graduate students.\n\n==Administration==\nWestminster College has had nineteen presidents since its founding; the current president, Dr. Bethami Dobkin, was appointed in July 2018.<ref>{{Cite web |first=William |last=Trojan |date=June 21, 2015 | title = Westminster Announces New President and Board of Trustees Members | publisher = UtahPulse.com | url = http://utahpulse.com/index.php/features/business/2353-westminster-announces-new-president-and-board-of-trustees-members | accessdate = June 22, 2015}}</ref>\nIt has an endowment of $46.1 million as of October 2018.<ref name=\"endowment\" />\n\n==Academics==\nWestminster College comprises four schools: the School of Arts and Sciences, the Bill and Vieve Gore School of Business, the School of Education, and the School of Nursing and Health Sciences. The college operates on a fall and spring semester system with a mini term in May and eight- and twelve-week summer terms.\n\nWestminster offers 34 undergraduate majors conferring BA and BS degrees, which do not include its pre-med, pre-law, and pre-dental programs. In addition to a number of post-baccalaureate certificate programs in various fields, Westminster also offers 13 graduate degrees: Master of Business Administration (MBA), Master of Business Administration in Technology Commercialization (MBATC), Master of Accountancy (MAcc), Master of Arts in Community Leadership (MACL), Master of Arts in Teaching (MAT), Master of Education (MEd), Master of Public Health (MPH), Master of Science in Nursing (MSN), Master of Science in Nursing Education (MSNEd), Master of Science in Nurse Anesthesia (MSNA), Master of Professional Communication (MPC), Master of Strategic Communication (MSC), and Master of Science in Clinical Mental Health Counseling (MSMHC).<ref name=\"http\" />\n\nWestminster College recently launched a new program within the Gore School of Business focusing on training students to be entrepreneurs. The Center for New Enterprise will offer graduate and undergraduate degrees as well as community education programs in entrepreneurship.\n\nWestminster College is accredited by the [[Northwest Commission on Colleges and Universities]]. Programs throughout the college are accredited as well.<ref name=\"http\" />\n\n===Recognition===\n\nWestminster College is the only private, non-denominational, comprehensive liberal arts college in Utah. Admissions statistics advertise a student-faculty ratio of 9:1. [[U.S. News & World Report]] consistently ranks Westminster in the top tier of Master's universities in the West and as an excellent educational value.{{citation needed|date=June 2016}} Westminster has also been recognized as one of the best colleges in the country by the Princeton Review for more than a decade.<ref>Christensen, Megan Marsden (August 6, 2015). \"[http://www.ksl.com/?nid=148&sid=35840782 Princeton Review ranks Westminster College among top 380 in nation]\".

The Associated Students of Westminster is the student association on campus. The school newspaper is a bi-weekly called \"The Forum\".  There is also a nationally recognized literary journal known as ''Ellipsis''.  The ''Estonian,'' Westminster's student [[yearbook]], was last published in 1987.\n\n==Athletics==\n{{main|Westminster Griffins}}\nWestminster College teams, nicknamed athletically as the Griffins, are active members of [[National Collegiate Athletic Association|NCAA]] [[NCAA Division II|Division II]] and the [[Rocky Mountain Athletic Conference]] (RMAC). NCAA Division II Men's sports include basketball, cross country, golf, lacrosse, skiing, soccer and track & field; while women's sports include basketball, cross country, golf, lacrosse, skiing, soccer, track & field and volleyball. The Griffins men's and women's alpine skiing teams compete in the Rocky Mountain Intercollegiate Ski Association (RMISA) affiliated with the NCAA. Current non-NCAA sports include cheer, cycling, dance, men's soccer (club) and snowboard.\n\nPrior to 1979, Westminster College athletic teams were called the Parsons, and the school was a member of the Rocky Mountain Athletic Conference (RMAC), which was a member of the [[National Association of Intercollegiate Athletics|NAIA]] at the time. The school joined said conference in the 1967\u201368 academic year. Football, basketball, and other team sports were offered at the intercollegiate level. That year, however, a financial crisis at the school caused it to discontinue its intercollegiate athletic program. Beginning in the 1990s, Westminster gradually began to restore an intercollegiate athletic program.\n\n==Notable alumni==\n<!-- in general people should only be included if they are notable enough to have their own wiki article -->\n*[[Maddie Bowman]] \u2013 freestyle skier<ref>{{cite web|title=Maddie Bowman|url=http://www.teamusa.org/Athletes/BO/Maddie-Bowman|publisher=United States Olympic Committee|accessdate=23 April 2014}}</ref>\n*Ray Bradford (2007) \u2013 Forbes \"30 Under 30\" honoree, 2012<ref>Forbes (2012). \"[https://www.forbes.com/special-report/2012/30-under-30/30-under-30_finance.html 30 Under 30 Finance]\".

Sonic booms generate enormous amounts of [[sound]] energy, sounding similar to an [[explosion]] or a [[thunder]]clap to the human ear. The crack of a supersonic [[bullet]] passing overhead or the crack of a [[bullwhip]] are examples of a sonic boom in miniature.<ref name=\"americanscientist.org\">{{cite journal |last1=May |first1=Mike |title=Crackin' Good Mathematics |journal=American Scientist |date=September 2002 |volume=90 |issue=5 |pages=415\u2013416 |jstor=27857718}}</ref>\n\nSonic booms due to large supersonic aircraft can be particularly loud and startling, tend to awaken people, and may cause minor damage to some structures. They led to prohibition of routine supersonic flight over land. Although they cannot be completely prevented, research suggests that with careful shaping of the vehicle the nuisance due to them may be reduced to the point that overland supersonic flight may become a practical option.{{Citation needed|date=December 2019}}\n\nA sonic boom does not occur only at the moment an object crosses the speed of sound; and neither is it heard in all directions emanating from the speeding object. Rather the boom is a continuous effect that occurs while the object is travelling at supersonic speeds. But it affects only observers that are positioned at a point that intersects a region in the shape of a geometrical cone behind the object. As the object moves, this conical region also moves behind it and when the cone passes over the observer, they will briefly experience the ''boom''.\n\n==Causes==\nWhen an aircraft passes through the air, it creates a series of [[P-wave|pressure waves]] in front of the aircraft and behind it, similar to the [[Bow wave|bow and stern waves]] created by a boat. These waves travel at the [[speed of sound]] and, as the speed of the object increases, the waves are forced together, or compressed, because they cannot get out of each other's way quickly enough. Eventually they merge into a single shock wave, which travels at the speed of sound, a critical speed known as ''Mach 1'', and is approximately {{convert|1235|km/h|mph|abbr=on}} at sea level and {{convert|20|C|F}}.\n\n{{anchor|Mach cone}}In smooth flight, the shock wave starts at the nose of the aircraft and ends at the tail.  Because the different radial directions around the aircraft's direction of travel are equivalent (given the \"smooth flight\" condition), the shock wave forms a ''Mach cone'', similar to a [[vapour cone]], with the aircraft at its tip.  The half-angle between direction of flight and the shock wave <math> \\alpha </math> is given by:\n\n:<math>\\sin( \\alpha) =\\frac{v_\\text{sound}}{v_\\text{object}} </math>,\n\nwhere  <math> \\frac{v_\\text{sound}}{v_\\text{object}} </math> is the inverse <math>\\Big(\\frac{1}{Ma}\\Big)</math> of the plane's [[Mach number]] (<math>Ma = \\frac{v_\\text{object}}{v_\\text{sound}}</math>).  Thus the faster the plane travels, the finer and more pointed the cone is.\n\nThere is a rise in pressure at the nose, decreasing steadily to a negative pressure at the tail, followed by a sudden return to normal pressure after the object passes. This \"[[overpressure]] profile\" is known as an N-wave because of its shape. The \"boom\" is experienced when there is a sudden change in pressure; therefore, an N-wave causes two booms \u2013 one when the initial pressure-rise reaches an observer, and another when the pressure returns to normal. This leads to a distinctive \"double boom\" from a supersonic aircraft. When the aircraft is maneuvering, the pressure distribution changes into different forms, with a characteristic U-wave shape.\n\nSince the boom is being generated continually as long as the aircraft is supersonic, it fills out a narrow path on the ground following the aircraft's flight path, a bit like an unrolling [[red carpet]], and hence known as the ''boom carpet''.  Its width depends on the altitude of the aircraft. The distance from the point on the ground where the boom is heard to the aircraft depends on its altitude and the angle <math> \\alpha </math>.\n\nFor today's supersonic aircraft in normal operating conditions, the peak overpressure varies from less than 50 to 500 [[Pascal (unit)|Pa]] (1 to 10 psf (pound per square foot)) for an N-wave boom. Peak [[overpressure]]s for U-waves are amplified two to five times the N-wave, but this amplified overpressure impacts only a very small area when compared to the area exposed to the rest of the sonic boom. The strongest sonic boom ever recorded was 7,000 Pa (144 psf) and it did not cause injury to the researchers who were exposed to it. The boom was produced by an [[F-4 Phantom II|F-4]] flying just above the speed of sound at an altitude of {{convert|100|ft|m}}.<ref>[http://proceedings.esri.com/library/userconf/proc01/professional/papers/pap284/p284.htm Analyzing Sonic Boom Footprints of Military Jets, Andy S. Rogers, A.O.T, Inc.]</ref> In recent tests, the maximum boom measured during more realistic flight conditions was 1,010 Pa (21 psf). There is a probability that some damage \u2014 shattered glass, for example \u2014 will result from a sonic boom. Buildings in good condition should suffer no damage by pressures of 530 Pa (11 psf) or less. And, typically, community exposure to sonic boom is below 100 Pa (2 psf). Ground motion resulting from sonic boom is rare and is well below structural damage thresholds accepted by the [[U.S. Bureau of Mines]] and other agencies.<ref name=\"Fact Sheet\">USAF Fact Sheet 96-03, Armstrong Laboratory, 1996</ref>\n\nThe power, or volume, of the shock wave depends on the quantity of air that is being accelerated, and thus the size and shape of the aircraft. As the aircraft increases speed the shock cone gets ''tighter'' around the craft and becomes weaker to the point that at very high speeds and altitudes no boom is heard.  The \"length\" of the boom from front to back depends on the length of the aircraft to a power of 3/2. Longer aircraft therefore \"spread out\" their booms more than smaller ones, which leads to a less powerful boom.<ref name=seebass>[ftp://ftp.rta.nato.int/PubFulltext/RTO/EN/RTO-EN-004/$EN-004-06.pdf Sonic Boom Minimization Richard Seebass]{{dead link|date=January 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref>\n\nSeveral smaller shock waves can and usually do form at other points on the aircraft, primarily at any convex points, or curves, the leading wing edge, and especially the inlet to engines. These secondary shockwaves are caused by the air being forced to turn around these convex points, which generates a shock wave in [[Supersonic speed|supersonic flow]].\n\nThe later shock waves are somewhat faster than the first one, travel faster and add to the main shockwave at some distance away from the aircraft to create a much more defined N-wave shape. This maximizes both the magnitude and the \"rise time\" of the shock which makes the boom seem louder. On most aircraft designs the characteristic distance is about {{convert|40000|ft|m|sigfig=2}}, meaning that below this altitude the sonic boom will be \"softer\". However, the drag at this altitude or below makes supersonic travel particularly inefficient, which poses a serious problem.\n\n==Measurement and examples==\nThe [[pressure]] from sonic booms caused by aircraft often is a few pounds per square foot. A vehicle flying at greater altitude will generate lower pressures on the ground, because the shock wave reduces in intensity as it spreads out away from the vehicle, but the sonic booms are less affected by vehicle speed.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

This assumption was proven false when the [[North American XB-70]] ''Valkyrie'' started flying, and it was found that the boom was a problem even at 70,000 feet (21,000&nbsp;m). It was during these tests that the N-wave was first characterized.\n\nRichard Seebass and his colleague Albert George at [[Cornell University]] studied the problem extensively and eventually defined a \"[[figure of merit]]\" (FM) to characterize the sonic boom levels of different aircraft. FM is a function of the aircraft weight and the aircraft length. The lower this value, the less boom the aircraft generates, with figures of about 1 or lower being considered acceptable. Using this calculation, they found FMs of about 1.4 for [[Concorde]] and 1.9 for the [[Boeing 2707]]. This eventually doomed most SST projects as public resentment, mixed with politics, eventually resulted in laws that made any such aircraft impractical (flying supersonically only over water for instance). Another way to express this is [[wing span]]. The [[fuselage]] of even a large supersonic aircraft is very sleek and with enough angle of attack and wing span the plane can fly so high that the boom by the fuselage is not important. The larger the wing span, the greater the downwards impulse which can be applied to the air, the greater the boom felt. A smaller wing span favors small aeroplane designs like [[business jets]].<ref name=seebass/>\n\nSeebass and George also worked on the problem from a different angle, trying to spread out the N-wave laterally and temporally (longitudinally), by producing a strong and downwards-focused ([[SR-71 Blackbird]], [[Boeing X-43]]) shock at a sharp, but wide angle nose cone, which will travel at slightly supersonic speed ([[Shock wave|bow shock]]), and using a swept back [[flying wing]] or an [[Oblique wing|oblique flying wing]] to smooth out this shock along the direction of flight (the tail of the shock travels at sonic speed). To adapt this principle to existing planes, which generate a shock at their [[nose cone]] and an even stronger one at their wing leading edge, the fuselage below the wing is shaped according to the [[area rule]]. Ideally this would raise the characteristic altitude from {{convert|40000|ft|m}} to 60,000 feet (from 12,000&nbsp;m to 18,000&nbsp;m), which is where most SST aircraft were expected to fly.<ref name=seebass/>\n\n[[File:Northrop F-5E (modified) DARPA sonic tests 04.07R.jpg|thumb|NASA F-5E modified for DARPA sonic boom tests]]\nThis remained untested for decades, until [[Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency|DARPA]] started the [[Shaped Sonic Boom Demonstration|Quiet Supersonic Platform]] project and funded the [[Shaped Sonic Boom Demonstration]] (SSBD) aircraft to test it. SSBD used an [[F-5 Freedom Fighter]].  The F-5E was modified with a highly refined shape which lengthened the nose to that of the F-5F model.  The [[aircraft fairing|fairing]] extended from the nose all the way back to the inlets on the underside of the aircraft.  The SSBD was tested over a two-year period culminating in 21 flights and was an extensive study on sonic boom characteristics. After measuring the 1,300 recordings, some taken inside the shock wave by a [[chase plane]], the SSBD demonstrated a reduction in boom by about one-third. Although one-third is not a huge reduction, it could have reduced Concorde's boom to an acceptable level; one below the FM&nbsp;= 1 limit stated above, for instance.\n\nAs a follow-on to SSBD, in 2006 a [[NASA]]-[[Gulfstream Aerospace]] team tested the [[Quiet Spike]] on NASA-Dryden's F-15B aircraft 836.  The [[Quiet Spike]] is a telescoping boom fitted to the nose of an aircraft specifically designed to weaken the strength of the shock waves forming on the nose of the aircraft at supersonic speeds. Over 50 test flights were performed.  Several flights included probing of the shockwaves by a second F-15B, NASA's [[Intelligent Flight Control System]] testbed, aircraft 837.\n\nThere are theoretical designs that do not appear to create sonic booms at all, such as the [[Busemann's Biplane]]. However, creating a shockwave is inescapable if they generate aerodynamic lift.<ref name=seebass/>\n\nNASA and [[Lockheed Martin]] Aeronautics Co. are working together to build an experimental aircraft called the [[Low Boom Flight Demonstrator]] (LBFD), which will reduce the sonic boom synonymous with high-speed flight to the sound of a car door closing. The agency has awarded a $247.5 million contract to construct a working version of the sleek, single-pilot plane by summer 2021 and should begin testing over the following years to determine whether the design could eventually be adapted to commercial aircraft.<ref>{{cite press release \n|last= \n|first= \n|date= 3 April 2018\n|title= NASA Awards Contract to Build Quieter Supersonic Aircraft\n|url= https://www.nasa.gov/press-release/nasa-awards-contract-to-build-quieter-supersonic-aircraft\n|location= \n|publisher= \n|agency= NASA\n|access-date=5 April 2018}}</ref>\n\n==Perception, noise and other concerns==\n[[File:Sonicboom animation.gif|thumb|A point source emitting spherical fronts while increasing its velocity linearly with time. For short times the Doppler effect is visible. When v=c the sonic boom is visible. When v>c the Mach cone is visible.]]\nThe sound of a sonic boom depends largely on the distance between the observer and the aircraft shape producing the sonic boom. A sonic boom is usually heard as a deep double \"boom\" as the aircraft is usually some distance away. The sound is much like that of [[Mortar (weapon)|mortar bombs]], commonly used in [[firework display]]s. It is a common misconception that only one boom is generated during the subsonic to supersonic transition; rather, the boom is continuous along the boom carpet for the entire supersonic flight. As a former Concorde pilot puts it, \"You don't actually hear anything on board. All we see is the pressure wave moving down the aeroplane \u2013 it gives an indication on the instruments. And that's what we see around Mach 1. But we don't hear the sonic boom or anything like that. That's rather like the wake of a ship \u2013 it's behind us.\".<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/talking_point/3207470.stm BBC News interview with former Concorde Pilot (2003)]</ref>\n\nIn 1964, NASA and the [[Federal Aviation Administration]] began the [[Oklahoma City sonic boom tests]], which caused eight sonic booms per day over a period of six months. Valuable data was gathered from the experiment, but 15,000 complaints were generated and ultimately entangled the government in a [[class action]] lawsuit, which it lost on appeal in 1969.\n\nSonic booms were also a nuisance in North Cornwall and North Devon in the UK as these areas were underneath the flight path of Concorde. Windows would rattle and in some cases the \"torching\" (pointing underneath roof slates) would be dislodged with the vibration.\n\nThere has been recent work in this area, notably under DARPA's Quiet Supersonic Platform studies.  Research by acoustics experts under this program began looking more closely at the composition of sonic booms, including the frequency content.  Several characteristics of the traditional sonic boom \"N\" wave can influence how loud and irritating it can be perceived by listeners on the ground.  Even strong N-waves such as those generated by Concorde or military aircraft can be far less objectionable if the rise time of the over-pressure is sufficiently long.  A new metric has emerged, known as ''perceived'' loudness, measured in PLdB.  This takes into account the frequency content, rise time, etc.  A well-known example is the [[Finger snapping|snapping of one's fingers]] in which the \"perceived\" sound is nothing more than an annoyance.\n\nThe energy range of sonic boom is concentrated in the 0.1\u2013100 [[hertz]] [[frequency range]] that is considerably below that of subsonic aircraft, [[Gunshot|gunfire]] and most [[industrial noise]]. Duration of sonic boom is brief; less than a second, 100 milliseconds (0.1 second) for most fighter-sized aircraft and 500 milliseconds for the space shuttle or Concorde jetliner. The intensity and width of a sonic boom path depends on the physical characteristics of the aircraft and how it is operated. In general, the greater an aircraft's altitude, the lower the over-pressure on the ground. Greater altitude also increases the boom's lateral spread, exposing a wider area to the boom. Over-pressures in the sonic boom impact area, however, will not be uniform. Boom intensity is greatest directly under the flight path, progressively weakening with greater horizontal distance away from the aircraft flight track.  Ground width of the boom exposure area is approximately {{convert|1|smi|km}} for each {{convert|1000|ft|m}} of altitude (the width is about five times the altitude); that is, an aircraft flying supersonic at {{convert|30000|ft|m}} will create a lateral boom spread of about {{convert|30|mi|km}}. For steady supersonic flight, the boom is described as a carpet boom since it moves with the aircraft as it maintains supersonic speed and altitude. Some maneuvers, diving, acceleration or turning, can cause focusing of the boom. Other maneuvers, such as deceleration and climbing, can reduce the strength of the shock. In some instances weather conditions can distort sonic booms.<ref name=\"Fact Sheet\" />\n\nDepending on the aircraft's altitude, sonic booms reach the ground two to 60 seconds after flyover. However, not all booms are heard at ground level. The speed of sound at any altitude is a function of air temperature. A decrease or increase in temperature results in a corresponding decrease or increase in sound speed. Under standard atmospheric conditions, air temperature decreases with increased altitude. For example, when sea-level temperature is 59 degrees Fahrenheit (15&nbsp;\u00b0C), the temperature at {{convert|30000|ft|m}} drops to minus 49 degrees Fahrenheit (\u221245&nbsp;\u00b0C). This temperature gradient helps bend the sound waves upward. Therefore, for a boom to reach the ground, the aircraft speed relative to the ground must be greater than the speed of sound at the ground. For example, the speed of sound at {{convert|30000|ft|m}} is about {{convert|670|mph|km/h}}, but an aircraft must travel at least {{convert|750|mph|km/h}} (Mach 1.12, where Mach 1 equals the speed of sound) for a boom to be heard on the ground.<ref name=\"Fact Sheet\" />\n\nThe composition of the atmosphere is also a factor.  Temperature variations, [[humidity]], [[atmospheric pollution]], and [[wind]]s can all have an effect on how a sonic boom is perceived on the ground.  Even the ground itself can influence the sound of a sonic boom.  Hard surfaces such as [[concrete]], [[Road surface|pavement]], and large buildings can cause reflections which may amplify the sound of a sonic boom.  Similarly, [[grass]]y fields and lots of [[foliage]] can help attenuate the strength of the over-pressure of a sonic boom.\n\nCurrently there are no industry-accepted standards for the acceptability of a sonic boom. However, work is underway to create metrics that will help in understanding how humans respond to the noise generated by sonic booms. <ref>{{Cite journal|last=Loubeau|first=Alexandra|last2=Naka|first2=Yusuke|last3=Cook|first3=Brian G.|last4=Sparrow|first4=Victor W.|last5=Morgenstern|first5=John M.|date=2015-10-28|title=A new evaluation of noise metrics for sonic booms using existing data|url=https://aip.scitation.org/doi/abs/10.1063/1.4934481|journal=AIP Conference Proceedings|volume=1685|issue=1|pages=090015|doi=10.1063/1.4934481|issn=0094-243X}}</ref> Until such metrics can be established, either through further study or supersonic overflight testing, it is doubtful that legislation will be enacted to remove the current prohibition on supersonic overflight in place in several countries, including the United States.\n\n==Bullwhip==\n[[File:Bullwhip.jpg|right|thumb|150px|An Australian bullwhip.]]\nThe cracking sound a [[bullwhip]] makes when properly wielded is, in fact, a small sonic boom. The end of the whip, known as the ''\"cracker\"'', moves faster than the speed of sound, thus creating a sonic boom.<ref name=\"americanscientist.org\"/>\n\nA bullwhip tapers down from the handle section to the cracker. The cracker has much less mass than the handle section. When the whip is sharply swung, the energy is transferred down the length of the tapering whip.

The crack of a supersonic [[bullet]] passing overhead or the crack of a [[bullwhip]] are examples of a sonic boom in miniature.<ref name=\"americanscientist.org\">{{cite journal |last1=May |first1=Mike |title=Crackin' Good Mathematics |journal=American Scientist |date=September 2002 |volume=90 |issue=5 |pages=415\u2013416 |jstor=27857718}}</ref>\n\nSonic booms due to large supersonic aircraft can be particularly loud and startling, tend to awaken people, and may cause minor damage to some structures. They led to prohibition of routine supersonic flight over land. Although they cannot be completely prevented, research suggests that with careful shaping of the vehicle the nuisance due to them may be reduced to the point that overland supersonic flight may become a practical option.{{Citation needed|date=December 2019}}\n\nA sonic boom does not occur only at the moment an object crosses the speed of sound; and neither is it heard in all directions emanating from the speeding object. Rather the boom is a continuous effect that occurs while the object is travelling at supersonic speeds. But it affects only observers that are positioned at a point that intersects a region in the shape of a geometrical cone behind the object. As the object moves, this conical region also moves behind it and when the cone passes over the observer, they will briefly experience the ''boom''.\n\n==Causes==\nWhen an aircraft passes through the air, it creates a series of [[P-wave|pressure waves]] in front of the aircraft and behind it, similar to the [[Bow wave|bow and stern waves]] created by a boat. These waves travel at the [[speed of sound]] and, as the speed of the object increases, the waves are forced together, or compressed, because they cannot get out of each other's way quickly enough. Eventually they merge into a single shock wave, which travels at the speed of sound, a critical speed known as ''Mach 1'', and is approximately {{convert|1235|km/h|mph|abbr=on}} at sea level and {{convert|20|C|F}}.\n\n{{anchor|Mach cone}}In smooth flight, the shock wave starts at the nose of the aircraft and ends at the tail.  Because the different radial directions around the aircraft's direction of travel are equivalent (given the \"smooth flight\" condition), the shock wave forms a ''Mach cone'', similar to a [[vapour cone]], with the aircraft at its tip.  The half-angle between direction of flight and the shock wave <math> \\alpha </math> is given by:\n\n:<math>\\sin( \\alpha) =\\frac{v_\\text{sound}}{v_\\text{object}} </math>,\n\nwhere  <math> \\frac{v_\\text{sound}}{v_\\text{object}} </math> is the inverse <math>\\Big(\\frac{1}{Ma}\\Big)</math> of the plane's [[Mach number]] (<math>Ma = \\frac{v_\\text{object}}{v_\\text{sound}}</math>).  Thus the faster the plane travels, the finer and more pointed the cone is.\n\nThere is a rise in pressure at the nose, decreasing steadily to a negative pressure at the tail, followed by a sudden return to normal pressure after the object passes. This \"[[overpressure]] profile\" is known as an N-wave because of its shape. The \"boom\" is experienced when there is a sudden change in pressure; therefore, an N-wave causes two booms \u2013 one when the initial pressure-rise reaches an observer, and another when the pressure returns to normal. This leads to a distinctive \"double boom\" from a supersonic aircraft. When the aircraft is maneuvering, the pressure distribution changes into different forms, with a characteristic U-wave shape.\n\nSince the boom is being generated continually as long as the aircraft is supersonic, it fills out a narrow path on the ground following the aircraft's flight path, a bit like an unrolling [[red carpet]], and hence known as the ''boom carpet''.  Its width depends on the altitude of the aircraft. The distance from the point on the ground where the boom is heard to the aircraft depends on its altitude and the angle <math> \\alpha </math>.\n\nFor today's supersonic aircraft in normal operating conditions, the peak overpressure varies from less than 50 to 500 [[Pascal (unit)|Pa]] (1 to 10 psf (pound per square foot)) for an N-wave boom. Peak [[overpressure]]s for U-waves are amplified two to five times the N-wave, but this amplified overpressure impacts only a very small area when compared to the area exposed to the rest of the sonic boom. The strongest sonic boom ever recorded was 7,000 Pa (144 psf) and it did not cause injury to the researchers who were exposed to it. The boom was produced by an [[F-4 Phantom II|F-4]] flying just above the speed of sound at an altitude of {{convert|100|ft|m}}.<ref>[http://proceedings.esri.com/library/userconf/proc01/professional/papers/pap284/p284.htm Analyzing Sonic Boom Footprints of Military Jets, Andy S. Rogers, A.O.T, Inc.]</ref> In recent tests, the maximum boom measured during more realistic flight conditions was 1,010 Pa (21 psf). There is a probability that some damage \u2014 shattered glass, for example \u2014 will result from a sonic boom. Buildings in good condition should suffer no damage by pressures of 530 Pa (11 psf) or less. And, typically, community exposure to sonic boom is below 100 Pa (2 psf). Ground motion resulting from sonic boom is rare and is well below structural damage thresholds accepted by the [[U.S. Bureau of Mines]] and other agencies.<ref name=\"Fact Sheet\">USAF Fact Sheet 96-03, Armstrong Laboratory, 1996</ref>\n\nThe power, or volume, of the shock wave depends on the quantity of air that is being accelerated, and thus the size and shape of the aircraft. As the aircraft increases speed the shock cone gets ''tighter'' around the craft and becomes weaker to the point that at very high speeds and altitudes no boom is heard.  The \"length\" of the boom from front to back depends on the length of the aircraft to a power of 3/2. Longer aircraft therefore \"spread out\" their booms more than smaller ones, which leads to a less powerful boom.<ref name=seebass>[ftp://ftp.rta.nato.int/PubFulltext/RTO/EN/RTO-EN-004/$EN-004-06.pdf Sonic Boom Minimization Richard Seebass]{{dead link|date=January 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref>\n\nSeveral smaller shock waves can and usually do form at other points on the aircraft, primarily at any convex points, or curves, the leading wing edge, and especially the inlet to engines. These secondary shockwaves are caused by the air being forced to turn around these convex points, which generates a shock wave in [[Supersonic speed|supersonic flow]].\n\nThe later shock waves are somewhat faster than the first one, travel faster and add to the main shockwave at some distance away from the aircraft to create a much more defined N-wave shape. This maximizes both the magnitude and the \"rise time\" of the shock which makes the boom seem louder. On most aircraft designs the characteristic distance is about {{convert|40000|ft|m|sigfig=2}}, meaning that below this altitude the sonic boom will be \"softer\". However, the drag at this altitude or below makes supersonic travel particularly inefficient, which poses a serious problem.\n\n==Measurement and examples==\nThe [[pressure]] from sonic booms caused by aircraft often is a few pounds per square foot. A vehicle flying at greater altitude will generate lower pressures on the ground, because the shock wave reduces in intensity as it spreads out away from the vehicle, but the sonic booms are less affected by vehicle speed.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

The agency has awarded a $247.5 million contract to construct a working version of the sleek, single-pilot plane by summer 2021 and should begin testing over the following years to determine whether the design could eventually be adapted to commercial aircraft.<ref>{{cite press release \n|last= \n|first= \n|date= 3 April 2018\n|title= NASA Awards Contract to Build Quieter Supersonic Aircraft\n|url= https://www.nasa.gov/press-release/nasa-awards-contract-to-build-quieter-supersonic-aircraft\n|location= \n|publisher= \n|agency= NASA\n|access-date=5 April 2018}}</ref>\n\n==Perception, noise and other concerns==\n[[File:Sonicboom animation.gif|thumb|A point source emitting spherical fronts while increasing its velocity linearly with time. For short times the Doppler effect is visible. When v=c the sonic boom is visible. When v>c the Mach cone is visible.]]\nThe sound of a sonic boom depends largely on the distance between the observer and the aircraft shape producing the sonic boom. A sonic boom is usually heard as a deep double \"boom\" as the aircraft is usually some distance away. The sound is much like that of [[Mortar (weapon)|mortar bombs]], commonly used in [[firework display]]s. It is a common misconception that only one boom is generated during the subsonic to supersonic transition; rather, the boom is continuous along the boom carpet for the entire supersonic flight. As a former Concorde pilot puts it, \"You don't actually hear anything on board. All we see is the pressure wave moving down the aeroplane \u2013 it gives an indication on the instruments. And that's what we see around Mach 1. But we don't hear the sonic boom or anything like that. That's rather like the wake of a ship \u2013 it's behind us.\".<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/talking_point/3207470.stm BBC News interview with former Concorde Pilot (2003)]</ref>\n\nIn 1964, NASA and the [[Federal Aviation Administration]] began the [[Oklahoma City sonic boom tests]], which caused eight sonic booms per day over a period of six months. Valuable data was gathered from the experiment, but 15,000 complaints were generated and ultimately entangled the government in a [[class action]] lawsuit, which it lost on appeal in 1969.\n\nSonic booms were also a nuisance in North Cornwall and North Devon in the UK as these areas were underneath the flight path of Concorde. Windows would rattle and in some cases the \"torching\" (pointing underneath roof slates) would be dislodged with the vibration.\n\nThere has been recent work in this area, notably under DARPA's Quiet Supersonic Platform studies.  Research by acoustics experts under this program began looking more closely at the composition of sonic booms, including the frequency content.  Several characteristics of the traditional sonic boom \"N\" wave can influence how loud and irritating it can be perceived by listeners on the ground.  Even strong N-waves such as those generated by Concorde or military aircraft can be far less objectionable if the rise time of the over-pressure is sufficiently long.  A new metric has emerged, known as ''perceived'' loudness, measured in PLdB.  This takes into account the frequency content, rise time, etc.  A well-known example is the [[Finger snapping|snapping of one's fingers]] in which the \"perceived\" sound is nothing more than an annoyance.\n\nThe energy range of sonic boom is concentrated in the 0.1\u2013100 [[hertz]] [[frequency range]] that is considerably below that of subsonic aircraft, [[Gunshot|gunfire]] and most [[industrial noise]]. Duration of sonic boom is brief; less than a second, 100 milliseconds (0.1 second) for most fighter-sized aircraft and 500 milliseconds for the space shuttle or Concorde jetliner. The intensity and width of a sonic boom path depends on the physical characteristics of the aircraft and how it is operated. In general, the greater an aircraft's altitude, the lower the over-pressure on the ground. Greater altitude also increases the boom's lateral spread, exposing a wider area to the boom. Over-pressures in the sonic boom impact area, however, will not be uniform. Boom intensity is greatest directly under the flight path, progressively weakening with greater horizontal distance away from the aircraft flight track.  Ground width of the boom exposure area is approximately {{convert|1|smi|km}} for each {{convert|1000|ft|m}} of altitude (the width is about five times the altitude); that is, an aircraft flying supersonic at {{convert|30000|ft|m}} will create a lateral boom spread of about {{convert|30|mi|km}}. For steady supersonic flight, the boom is described as a carpet boom since it moves with the aircraft as it maintains supersonic speed and altitude. Some maneuvers, diving, acceleration or turning, can cause focusing of the boom. Other maneuvers, such as deceleration and climbing, can reduce the strength of the shock. In some instances weather conditions can distort sonic booms.<ref name=\"Fact Sheet\" />\n\nDepending on the aircraft's altitude, sonic booms reach the ground two to 60 seconds after flyover. However, not all booms are heard at ground level. The speed of sound at any altitude is a function of air temperature. A decrease or increase in temperature results in a corresponding decrease or increase in sound speed. Under standard atmospheric conditions, air temperature decreases with increased altitude. For example, when sea-level temperature is 59 degrees Fahrenheit (15&nbsp;\u00b0C), the temperature at {{convert|30000|ft|m}} drops to minus 49 degrees Fahrenheit (\u221245&nbsp;\u00b0C). This temperature gradient helps bend the sound waves upward. Therefore, for a boom to reach the ground, the aircraft speed relative to the ground must be greater than the speed of sound at the ground. For example, the speed of sound at {{convert|30000|ft|m}} is about {{convert|670|mph|km/h}}, but an aircraft must travel at least {{convert|750|mph|km/h}} (Mach 1.12, where Mach 1 equals the speed of sound) for a boom to be heard on the ground.<ref name=\"Fact Sheet\" />\n\nThe composition of the atmosphere is also a factor.  Temperature variations, [[humidity]], [[atmospheric pollution]], and [[wind]]s can all have an effect on how a sonic boom is perceived on the ground.  Even the ground itself can influence the sound of a sonic boom.  Hard surfaces such as [[concrete]], [[Road surface|pavement]], and large buildings can cause reflections which may amplify the sound of a sonic boom.  Similarly, [[grass]]y fields and lots of [[foliage]] can help attenuate the strength of the over-pressure of a sonic boom.\n\nCurrently there are no industry-accepted standards for the acceptability of a sonic boom. However, work is underway to create metrics that will help in understanding how humans respond to the noise generated by sonic booms. <ref>{{Cite journal|last=Loubeau|first=Alexandra|last2=Naka|first2=Yusuke|last3=Cook|first3=Brian G.|last4=Sparrow|first4=Victor W.|last5=Morgenstern|first5=John M.|date=2015-10-28|title=A new evaluation of noise metrics for sonic booms using existing data|url=https://aip.scitation.org/doi/abs/10.1063/1.4934481|journal=AIP Conference Proceedings|volume=1685|issue=1|pages=090015|doi=10.1063/1.4934481|issn=0094-243X}}</ref> Until such metrics can be established, either through further study or supersonic overflight testing, it is doubtful that legislation will be enacted to remove the current prohibition on supersonic overflight in place in several countries, including the United States.\n\n==Bullwhip==\n[[File:Bullwhip.jpg|right|thumb|150px|An Australian bullwhip.]]\nThe cracking sound a [[bullwhip]] makes when properly wielded is, in fact, a small sonic boom. The end of the whip, known as the ''\"cracker\"'', moves faster than the speed of sound, thus creating a sonic boom.<ref name=\"americanscientist.org\"/>\n\nA bullwhip tapers down from the handle section to the cracker. The cracker has much less mass than the handle section. When the whip is sharply swung, the energy is transferred down the length of the tapering whip.

At the height of his rule, he controlled [[Lower Egypt]], [[Upper Egypt]], [[Sudan (region)|Sudan]] and [[Arabia|parts of Arabia]] and the entire [[Levant]]. Though not a modern nationalist, he is regarded as the founder of modern Egypt.\n\nMuhammad Ali was born in [[Kavala]], [[Macedonia (region)|Ottoman Macedonia]], to a family of [[Albanians|Albanian]] origins. He was a military commander in an Albanian Ottoman force sent to recover Egypt from a [[French campaign in Egypt and Syria|French occupation]] under [[Napoleon]]. Following Napoleon's withdrawal, Muhammad Ali rose to power through a series of political maneuvers, and in 1805 he was named ''[[W\u0101li]]'' (viceroy) of Egypt and gained the rank of [[Pasha]].\n\nAs ''W\u0101li'', Muhammad Ali attempted to modernize Egypt by instituting dramatic reforms in the military, economic and cultural spheres. He also initiated a violent purge of the [[Mamluk]]s, consolidating his rule and permanently ending the Mamluk hold over Egypt.\n\nMilitarily, Muhammad Ali [[Wahhabi War|recaptured the Arabian territories]] for the sultan, and [[Egyptian conquest of Sudan (1820\u20131824)|conquered Sudan]] on his own accord. His attempt at suppressing the [[Greek War of Independence|Greek rebellion]] failed decisively, however, following an intervention by the European powers at [[Battle of Navarino|Navarino]]. In 1831, Muhammad Ali [[Egyptian\u2013Ottoman War (1831\u20131833)|waged war against the sultan]], capturing Syria, crossing into Anatolia and directly threatening [[Constantinople]] but Western Powers threatened him to retreat. He did the same invasion against the Ottoman Empire in 1840 , when he defeated again the Ottomans and had a free way to capture Istanbul. Faced with another European intervention, he accepted a brokered peace in 1842 and withdrew from the Levant; in return, he and his descendants were granted hereditary rule over Egypt and Sudan. The [[Muhammad Ali dynasty|dynasty]] he established would rule Egypt until the [[Egyptian revolution of 1952|revolution of 1952]].\n\n== Early life ==\n\n<!--these paragraphs refer to \"he\", but the text shows that \"he\" is sometimes Muhammad, and sometimes Ibrahim, and maybe others.

[[Mamluk]] power had been weakened, but not destroyed, and Ottoman forces clashed with the Mamluks for power.<ref>Tom Little, ''Egypt'', (New York: Frederick A. Praeger, 1958), 57.</ref> During this period of turmoil Muhammad Ali used his loyal Albanian troops to work with both sides, gaining power and prestige for himself.<ref name=Little57>Little, 57.</ref> As the conflict drew on, the local populace grew weary of the power struggle. In 1801, he allied with the [[Egypt Eyalet|Egypt]]ian leader [[Umar Makram]] and Egypt's [[Grand Imam of al-Azhar]]. During the infighting between the Ottomans and Mamluks between 1801 and 1805, Muhammad Ali carefully acted to gain the support of the general public.<ref>P.J. Vatikiotis, ''The History of Egypt'', (Baltimore, MD: Johns Hopkins University Press, 1985), 51.</ref>\n\nIn 1805, a group of prominent Egyptians led by the [[ulema]] (scholars, savants) demanded the replacement of ''W\u0101li'' (viceroy) [[Ahmad Khurshid Pasha]] by Muhammad Ali, and the Ottomans yielded. In 1809, though, Ali exiled Makram to [[Damietta]]. According to [[Abd al-Rahman al-Jabarti]], Makram had discovered Muhammad Ali's intentions to seize power for himself.<ref name=Little57/>\n\nSultan [[Selim III]] could not oppose Muhammad Ali's ascension. By appearing as the champion of the people Muhammad Ali was able to forestall popular opposition until he had consolidated his power.\n\n[[File:Mamluks, Horace Vernet.jpg|thumb|Massacre of the Mamelukes at the Cairo citadel by [[Horace Vernet]].]]\nThe Mamluks still posed the greatest threat to Muhammad Ali. They controlled Egypt for more than 600 years, and over that time they extended their rule systematically south along the Nile River to Upper Egypt. Muhammad Ali's approach was to eliminate the Mamluk leadership, then move against the rank and file. Muhammad Ali invited the Mamluk leaders to a celebration at the [[Cairo Citadel]] in honour of his son, [[Tusun Pasha]], who was to lead a military expedition into [[Arabia]]. The event was held on 1 March 1811. When the Mamluks had gathered at the Citadel, and were surrounded by Muhammad Ali's troops, he had his troops kill them.{{efn|Reports vary about how many died. William Cleveland claims 74 killed while H. Wood Jarvis claims nearly 500. Whatever the actual number, it is clear that the event dealt a serious blow to the Mamluks.<ref>Cleveland, 67.</ref><ref>H. Wood Jarvis, ''Pharaoh to Farouk'', (London: John Murray, 1956), 124.</ref>}} After the leaders were killed, Muhammad Ali dispatched his army throughout Egypt to rout the remainder of the Mamluk forces.\n\nMuhammad Ali transformed Egypt into a regional power which he saw as the natural successor to the decaying Ottoman Empire. He summed up his vision for Egypt as follows:\n\n{{bquote|I am well aware that the (Ottoman) Empire is heading by the day toward destruction... On its ruins I will build a vast kingdom... up to the Euphrates and the Tigris.<ref>Georges Douin, ed. ''Une Mission militaire francaise aupres de Mohamed Aly, correspondance des Generaux Belliard et Boyer'' (Cairo: ''Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 Royale de Geographie d'Egypte'', 1923)</ref>}}\n\n== Reinventing Egypt ==\n\n[[File:Mouhamed ali army&navy.jpg|thumb|Muhammad Ali of Egypt establishes a modern Navy.]]\n\nSultan [[Selim III]] (reigned 1789\u20131807) had recognized the need to reform and modernize the Ottoman Empire, specifically the military, along European lines to ensure that his state could compete. Selim III, however, faced stiff local opposition from an entrenched clergy and military apparatus, especially from the [[Janissaries]], the Ottoman infantry formed from the [[devshirme]] system. Consequently, Selim III was deposed and ultimately killed in 1808. Muhammad Ali, too, recognized the need to modernize, but unlike Selim, he had dispatched his chief rivals, giving him a free hand to attempt reforms similar to those first begun by Selim III.<ref>William L. Cleveland, ''A History of the Modern Middle East'' (Boulder: Westview Press, 2013), 57.</ref>\n\nMuhammad Ali's goal was for Egypt to leave the Ottoman Empire and be ruled by his own hereditary dynasty.<ref>Cleveland, 62.</ref> To do that, he had to reorganize Egyptian society, streamline the economy, train a professional bureaucracy, and build a modern military.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">All the Pasha\u2019s Men: Mehmed Ali, his army and the making of modern Egypt, Khaled Famy</ref>\n\nHis first task was to secure a revenue stream for Egypt. To accomplish this, Muhammad Ali 'nationalized' all the [[iltizam]] lands of Egypt, thereby officially owning all the production of the land. He accomplished the state annexation of property by raising taxes on the '[[tax-farmer]]s' who had previously owned the land throughout Egypt. The new taxes were intentionally high and when the tax-farmers could not extract the demanded payments from the peasants who worked the land, Muhammad Ali confiscated their properties. The other major source of revenue Muhammad Ali created was a new tax on [[waqf]] endowments, which were previously tax-free. Through these endowments, personal income could be set aside for schools or other charitable purposes. As well as raising revenue to fund his new military, this tax took revenue away from the local elite, Mamluks and the ulama, weakening opposition to Muhammad Ali's reforms.<ref>Vatikiotis, 55; Cleveland, 63.</ref>\n\n[[File:Jean-Fran\u00e7ois Portaels - Sketch for the portrait of Muhammad Ali, viceroy of Egypt.jpg|thumb|left|''Muhammad Ali'' by [[Jean-Fran\u00e7ois Portaels]], 1847]]\n\nIn practice, Muhammad Ali's land reform amounted to a monopoly on trade in Egypt. He required all producers to sell their goods to the state. The state in turn resold Egyptian goods, within Egypt and to foreign markets, and retained the surplus. The practice proved very profitable for Egypt with the cultivation of [[long staple cotton]], a new [[cash crop]]. To help improve production, he expanded the land used for agriculture and overhauled the irrigation system, largely completed by the [[corv\u00e9e]], or forced peasant labor. The new-found profits also extended down to the individual farmers, as the average wage increased fourfold.<ref>Little, 59; Cleveland, 63\u201364.</ref>\n\nIn addition to bolstering the agricultural sector, Muhammad Ali built an industrial base for Egypt. His motivation for doing so was primarily an effort to build a modern military. Consequently, he focused on weapons production. Factories based in Cairo produced [[musket]]s and [[cannon]]s. With a [[shipyard]] he built in [[Alexandria]], he began construction of a navy. By the end of the 1830s, Egypt's war industries had constructed nine 100-gun warships and were turning out 1,600 muskets a month.<ref name=Cleveland69>Cleveland, 69.</ref>\n\nHowever, the industrial innovations were not limited to weapons production. Muhammad Ali established a [[textile industry]] in an effort to compete with European industries and produce greater revenues for Egypt. While the textile industry was not successful, the entire endeavour employed tens of thousands of Egyptians.<ref name=Cleveland69 /> Muhammad Ali used contracts called [[concession (contract)|concessions]] to build cheap infrastructure - dams and railroads - whereby foreign European companies would raise capital, build projects, and collect most of the operating revenue but would provide Ali's government with a portion of that revenue. Ali also granted [[Barth\u00e9lemy Prosper Enfantin]] permission to build technical schools modeled after the [[Ecole Polytechnique]].<ref>{{cite book|first=Zachary|last=Karabell|title=Parting the desert: the creation of the Suez Canal|publisher=Alfred A.

To staff his new industries, Muhammad Ali employed a [[corv\u00e9e]] labor system. The peasantry objected to these conscriptions and many ran away from their villages to avoid being taken, sometimes fleeing as far away as [[Syria]]. A number of them maimed themselves so as to be unsuitable for combat: common ways of self-maiming were blinding an eye with rat poison and cutting off a finger of the right hand, so as to be unable to fire a rifle.\n\n[[File:\u0623\u0633\u0631\u0629 \u0645\u062d\u0645\u062f \u0639\u0644\u064a \u0628\u0627\u0634\u0627.JPG|thumb|Muhammad Ali of Egypt with his officials in [[Cairo]].]]\n\nBeyond building a functioning, industrial economy, Muhammad Ali also made an effort to train a professional military and bureaucracy. He sent promising citizens to Europe to study. Again the driving impulse behind the effort was to build a European-style army. Students were sent to study European languages, primarily French, so they could in turn translate military manuals into Arabic. He then used both educated Egyptians and imported European experts to establish schools and hospitals in Egypt. The European education also provided talented Egyptians with a means of social mobility.\n\nA by-product of Muhammad Ali's training program was the establishment of a [[Civil service|professional bureaucracy]]. Establishing an efficient central bureaucracy was an essential prerequisite for the success of Muhammad Ali's other reforms. In the process of destroying the Mamluks, the W\u0101li had to fill the governmental roles that the Mamluks had previously filled. In doing so, Muhammad Ali kept all central authority for himself. He partitioned Egypt into ten provinces responsible for collecting taxes and maintaining order.<ref name=Cleveland69 /> Muhammad Ali installed his sons in most key positions; however, his reforms did offer Egyptians opportunities beyond agriculture and industry.\n\nA 2015 study found that Ali's economic policies had a positive impact on industrialization in Egypt.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Panza|first=Laura|last2=Williamson|first2=Jeffrey G.|date=1 February 2015|title=Did Muhammad Ali foster industrialization in early nineteenth-century Egypt?|journal=The Economic History Review|language=en|volume=68|issue=1|pages=79\u2013100|doi=10.1111/1468-0289.12063|issn=1468-0289}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Mehemed Ali Egypt.jpg|thumb|Muhammad Ali of Egypt, drawn by [[Louis Dupr\u00e9 (painter)|Louis Dupr\u00e9]].]]\n\n== Law under Muhammad Ali ==\nThe purpose of the law was to represent Muhammad Ali in his absence.<ref>All the Pasha's Men: Mehmed Ali, his Army and the Making of Modern Egypt, 133</ref> Muhammad Ali started his renovations in law by moving towards a more effective control over crime within Egypt. Most notably he did this by passing his first penal legislation in 1829, in an effort to get a stronger hold over the population. By this time, Muhammad Ali was already moving towards an establishment of an independent state, which he first expressed in 1830, by creating a state of \"law and order\", where Christians within Egypt can be safe, which was a way Muhammad Ali was able to pull influence from Europe.<ref name=\":3\">{{Cite journal|last=Fahmy|first=Khaled|date=1 January 1999|title=The Anatomy of Justice: Forensic Medicine and Criminal Law in Nineteenth-Century Egypt|jstor=3399313|journal=Islamic Law and Society|volume=6|issue=2|pages=224\u2013271}}</ref> He started gradually renovating more of the government for him to hold more sway over it rather than the sultan.

This is observed in the use of hakimas to collect statistics on childbirth, either personally or through dayas, as well as in the cases where a hakima was used to examine a woman.<ref name=\":2\" />\n\n== Role in the Arabic literary renaissance ==\nIn the 1820s, Muhammad Ali sent the first educational \"mission\" of Egyptian students to Europe. This contact resulted in literature that is considered the dawn of the Arabic literary renaissance, known as the [[Nahda]].\n\nTo support the modernization of industry and the military, Muhammad Ali set up a number of schools in various fields where French texts were studied. [[Rifa'a al-Tahtawi]] supervised translations from French to Arabic on topics ranging from sociology and history to military technology, and these translations have been considered the second great translation movement, after the first [[Arab transmission of the Classics to the West#First period: Greek \u2013 Arabic translations|from Greek into Arabic]].\n\nIn 1819/21, his government founded the first indigenous press in the Arab World, the [[Bulaq Press]].<ref>{{cite journal|last=Verdery|first=Richard|title=The Publications of the B\u016bl\u0101q Press under Muhammad 'Al\u012b of Egypt|journal=Journal of the American Oriental Society|date=1971|volume=91|issue=1|pages=129\u2013132|url=http://www.ghazali.org/articles/jaos-91-1-rnv.pdf|accessdate=22 May 2014|doi=10.2307/600448|jstor=600448}}</ref>  The Bulaq press published the official [[gazette]] of Muhammad Ali's government.\n\nAmong his personal interests was the accumulation and breeding of [[Arabian horse]]s. In horses obtained as taxes and [[tribute]], Muhammad Ali recognised the unique characteristics and careful attention to bloodlines of the horses bred by the [[Bedouin]], particularly by the [[Anazeh]] in Syria and those bred in the [[Nejd]]. While his immediate successor had minimal interest in the horse breeding program, his grandson, who became [[Abbas I of Egypt|Abbas I]] shared this interest and further built upon his work.\n\n== Military campaigns ==\n[[File:Flag of Muhammad Ali.svg|The Flag of Muhamma Ali|thumb|Muhammad Ali's flag.]]\n\nThough Muhammad Ali's chief aim was to establish a European-style military, and carve out a personal empire, he waged war initially on behalf of the Ottoman Sultan, [[Mahmud II]], in Arabia and Greece, although he later came into open conflict with the Ottoman Empire.  He used several new strategies to ensure the success of his new military. First new recruits were isolated from the environment they were used to. They began housing soldiers in barracks, leadership enforced a strict regime of surveillance, roll call was done several times a day, and corporal punishment used to ensure the new fighting force grew to become a strong disciplined military.<ref>All the Pasha's Men: Mehmed Ali, his Army and the Making of Modern Egypt</ref> The army often used the [[bastinado]] and the [[Flagellation|whip]] to control and punish the soldiers.<ref>All the Pasha's Men: Mehmed Ali, his Army and the Making of Modern Egypt 127</ref> Muhammad not only wanted his soldiers to be disciplined, he also created many military codes to regulate the definitions of crime and punishment, this helped to create blind obedience to the laws.<ref>Khaled Fahmy, All the Pasha\u2019s Men: Mehmed Ali, his army and the making of modern Egypt (Cambridge, 1997), 119\u201347.</ref> A large part of Ali's goal of a European-style military was through the creation of new labelling and organizational systems to identify soldiers, distinguish officers from enlisted men, structure units, and properly distribute salaries.<ref>Khaled Fahmy, All the Pasha\u2019s Men: Mehmed Ali, his army and the making of modern Egypt (Cambridge, 1997), 142\u2013146.</ref> Soldiers were given a unique number that identified their unit and their role within it, and officers were expected to use lists with these numbers to keep a close watch on the men and ensure every man performed his clearly assigned duty.<ref>Khaled Fahmy, All the Pasha\u2019s Men: Mehmed Ali, his army and the making of modern Egypt (Cambridge, 1997), 142.</ref> This was particularly useful in identifying deserters who often fled in the chaos of massed movement, such as during forced marches or relocation to a new encampment.<ref>Khaled Fahmy, All the Pasha\u2019s Men: Mehmed Ali, his army and the making of modern Egypt (Cambridge, 1997), 144.</ref>\nThe soldiers were placed under strict surveillance in the barracks. In order to accomplish this Muhammad Ali relied on the Bedouins to guard the troops that were sent to the training camps.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/> Despite being hired to control the troops the Bedouins were actually a menace to the government who often had to use the army to control the Bedouins.<ref>All the Pasha's Men: Mehmed Ali, his Army and the Making of Modern Egypt, 123</ref> In order to combat this the government slowly switched from using Bedouins to guard the soldiers and to capture deserters and instead attempted to set up the expectation of internment from the beginning of the soldiers stay at the training camps in order to deter them from deserting the military in the first place.<ref>All the Pasha's Men: Mehmed Ali, his Army and the Making of Modern Egypt, 124</ref>\n\n=== Arabian campaign ===\n{{Main|Wahhabi War}}\n\nMuhammad Ali's first military campaign was an expedition into the [[Arabian Peninsula]]. The holy cities of [[Mecca]], and [[Medina]] had been captured by the [[House of Saud]], who had recently embraced a literalist [[Hanbali]] interpretation of [[Islam]]. Armed with their newfound religious zeal, the Saudis began conquering parts of Arabia. This culminated in the capture of the [[Hejaz]] region by 1805.\n\nWith the main Ottoman army tied up in Europe, Mahmud II turned to Muhammad Ali to [[Ottoman\u2013Saudi War|recapture the Arabian territories]]. Muhammad Ali in turn appointed his son, [[Tusun Pasha|Tusun]], to lead a military expedition in 1811. The campaign was initially turned back in Arabia; however, a second attack was launched in 1812 that succeeded in recapturing Hejaz.<ref>Henry Dodwell, ''The Founder of Modern Egypt: A Study of Muhammal \u2018Ali'', (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1967), 43\u201344.</ref>\n\nWhile the campaign was successful, the power of the Saudis was not broken. They continued to harass Ottoman and Egyptian forces from the central [[Nejd]] region of the Peninsula. Consequently, Muhammad Ali dispatched another of his sons, Ibrahim, at the head of another army to finally rout the Saudis. After a two-year campaign, the Saudis were crushed and most of the Saudi family was captured. The family leader, [[Abdullah ibn Saud]], was sent to Istanbul, and executed.<ref>Dodwell, 48.</ref>\n\n=== Conquest of Sudan ===\n{{Main|Egyptian conquest of Sudan (1820\u20131824)}}\n\nMuhammad Ali next turned his attention to military campaigns independent of the [[Sublime Porte|Porte]], beginning with the [[Sudan]] which he viewed as a valuable additional resource of territory, gold, and slaves. The Sudan at the time had no real central authority, as since the 18th century many petty kingdoms and tribal sheikhdoms had seceded from the declining [[Sultanate of Sennar]], fighting each other with Medieval weaponry. In 1820 Muhammad Ali dispatched an army of 5,000 troops commanded by his third son, Ismail and [[Abidin Bey]], south into Sudan with the intent of conquering the territory and subjugating it to his authority.<ref>Dodwell, 51.</ref> Ali's troops made headway into Sudan in 1821, but met with fierce resistance by the [[Shaigiya]]. Ultimately, the superiority of the Egyptian troops and firearms ensured the defeat of the Shaigiya and the subsequent conquest of the Sudan.<ref>Emanuel Be\u0161ka, ''Muhammad Ali\u00b4s Conquest of Sudan (1820-1824)''. Asian and African Studies, 2019, Vol. 28, No. 1, pp. 30-56.</ref> Ali now had an outpost from which he could expand to the source of the [[Nile]] in [[Ethiopia]], and [[Uganda]]. His administration captured slaves from the [[Nuba Mountains]], and west and south Sudan, all incorporated into a foot regiment known as the ''Gihadiya'' which were composed of the recently defeated Shaigiya who now took service under the invaders in exchange for keeping their domains. (pronounced ''Jihadiya'' in non-Egyptian Arabic). Ali's reign in Sudan, and that of his immediate successors, is remembered in Sudan as brutal and heavy-handed, contributing to the popular independence struggle of the self-proclaimed [[Mahdi]], [[Muhammad Ahmad]], in 1881.\n\n=== Greek rebellion ===\n{{Main|Greek War of Independence}}\n\n[[File:Ibrahim-Mehmet-Seve.jpg|thumb|Muhammad Ali Pasha with [[Ibrahim Pasha of Egypt|his son, Ibrahim]], and [[Soliman Pasha (al-Faransawi)|Colonel Joseph S\u00e8ve (''later'' Suleiman Pasha)]].]]\n\nWhile Muhammad Ali was expanding his authority into Africa, the Ottoman Empire was being challenged by ethnic rebellions in its European territories. The [[Greek War of Independence|rebellion]] in the [[Greece|Greek provinces]] of the Ottoman Empire began in 1821. The Ottoman army proved ineffectual in its attempts to put down the revolt as ethnic violence spread as far as [[Istanbul|Constantinople]]. With his own army proving ineffective, Sultan Mahmud II offered Muhammad Ali the island of [[Crete]] in exchange for his support in putting down the revolt.\n\nMuhammad Ali sent 16,000 soldiers, 100 transports, and 63 escort vessels under command of his son, [[Ibrahim Pasha of Egypt|Ibrahim Pasha]].<ref>Dodwell, 71.</ref> Britain, France, and Russia intervened to protect the Greeks. On 20 October 1827 at the [[Battle of Navarino]], while under the command of Muharram Bey, the Ottoman representative, the entire Egyptian navy was sunk by the European Allied fleet, under the command of Admiral [[Edward Codrington]]. If the [[Ottoman Porte|Porte]] was not in the least prepared for this confrontation, Muhammad Ali was even less prepared for the loss of his highly competent, expensively assembled and maintained navy. With its fleet essentially destroyed, Egypt had no way to support its forces in Greece and was forced to withdraw. Ultimately the campaign cost Muhammad Ali his navy and yielded no tangible gains.\n\n=== War against the sultan ===\n{{Main|Egyptian\u2013Ottoman War (1831\u20131833)}}\n\nIn compensation for his loss at Navarino, Muhammad Ali asked the Porte for the territory of [[Syria]]. The Ottomans were indifferent to the request; the Sultan himself asked blandly what would happen if Syria was given over and Muhammad Ali later deposed.<ref>12 Bahr Barra, Jamad I 1243/1828</ref> But Muhammad Ali was no longer willing to tolerate Ottoman indifference. To compensate for his and Egypt's losses, the wheels for the conquest of Syria were set in motion.\n\nLike other rulers of Egypt before him, Ali desired to control [[Bilad al-Sham]] (the Levant), both for its strategic value and for its rich natural resources; nor was this a sudden, vindictive decision on the part of the W\u0101li since he had harboured this goal since his early years as Egypt's unofficial ruler. For not only had Syria abundant natural resources, it also had a thriving international trading community with well-developed markets throughout the [[Levant]]; in addition, it would be a [[captive market]] for the goods now being produced in Egypt. Yet perhaps most of all, Syria was desirable as a buffer state between Egypt and the Ottoman Sultan.\n\nA new fleet was built, a new army was raised and on 31 October 1831, under Ibrahim Pasha, the Egyptian invasion of Syria initiated the [[First Turko-Egyptian War]]. For the sake of appearance on the world stage, a pretext for the invasion was vital. Ultimately, the excuse for the expedition was a quarrel with [[Abdullah Pasha ibn Ali|Abdullah Pasha]] of [[Acre, Israel|Acre]]. The W\u0101li alleged that 6,000 [[fellahin]] had fled to Acre to escape the draft, corv\u00e9e, and taxes, and he wanted them back.<ref>Afaf Lutfi al-Sayyid Marsot, ''Egypt in the reign of Muhammad Ali'', University of Cambridge, 1983</ref> (See also: [[1834 Arab revolt in Palestine]])\n\nThe Egyptians overran most of Syria and its hinterland with ease. The strongest and only really significant resistance was put up at the port city of Acre. The Egyptian force eventually captured the city after a six-month siege, which lasted from 3 November 1831 to 27 May 1832. Unrest on the Egyptian home front increased dramatically during the course of the siege. Ali was forced to squeeze Egypt more and more in order to support his campaign and his people resented the increased burden.\n\nAfter the fall of Acre, the Egyptian army marched north into [[Anatolia]]. At the [[Battle of Konya]] (21 December 1832), Ibrahim Pasha soundly defeated the Ottoman army led by the ''sadr azam'' [[Grand Vizier]] Reshid Pasha. There were now no military obstacles between Ibrahim's forces and Constantinople itself.\n\nThrough the course of the campaign, Muhammad Ali paid particular focus to the European powers. Fearing another intervention that would reverse all his gains, he proceeded slowly and cautiously. For example, Muhammad Ali continued the practice of using the sultan's name at Friday prayers in the newly captured territories and continued to circulate Ottoman coins instead of issuing new ones bearing his likeness.<ref>Dodwell, 111.</ref> So long as Muhammad Ali's march did not threaten to cause the complete collapse of the Ottoman state, the powers in Europe remained as passive observers.<ref>Dodwell, 112\u2013113.</ref>\n\nDespite this show, Muhammad Ali's goal was now to remove the current Ottoman Sultan [[Mahmud II]] and replace him with the sultan's son, the infant [[Abd\u00fclmecid I|Abd\u00fclmecid]]. This possibility so alarmed Mahmud II that he accepted Russia's offer of military aid resulting in the [[Treaty of H\u00fcnk\u00e2r \u0130skelesi]].<ref>Cleveland, 72.</ref> Russia's gain dismayed the British and French governments, resulting in their direct intervention. From this position, the European powers brokered a negotiated solution in May 1833 known as the [[Convention of Kutahya]].<ref name= Kupchan >{{cite book | title = Power in Transition: The Peaceful Change of International Order | author = Charles Kupchan  | publisher = United Nations University Press | year = 2001 |  page = 117 }}</ref> The terms of the peace were that Ali would withdraw his forces from Anatolia and receive the territories of [[Crete]] (then known as Candia) and the [[Hijaz]] as compensation, and Ibrahim Pasha would be appointed W\u0101li of Syria. The peace agreement fell short, however, of granting Muhammad Ali an independent kingdom for himself, leaving him wanting.<ref>Dodwell, 122\u2013123.</ref>\n\n[[File:Interview with Mehemet Ali in his Palace at Alexandria, by David Roberts and Louis Hague.jpg|thumb|left|''Interview with Mehmet Ali in his Palace at Alexandria'' (1839), with [[Patrick Campbell (British Army officer, born 1779)|Patrick Campbell]] in the centre. After [[David Roberts (painter)|David Roberts]], in [[The Holy Land, Syria, Idumea, Arabia, Egypt, and Nubia]]]]\nSensing that Muhammad Ali was not content with his gains, the sultan attempted to pre-empt further action against the Ottoman Empire by offering him hereditary rule in Egypt and Arabia if he withdrew from Syria and Crete and renounced any desire for full independence.<ref name=Vatikiotis66>Vatikiotis, 66.</ref> Muhammad Ali rejected the offer, knowing that Mahmud could not force the Egyptian presence from Syria and Crete.\n\nOn 25 May 1838, Muhammad Ali informed Britain, and France that he intended to declare independence from the Ottoman Empire.<ref>Dodwell, 171.</ref> This action was contrary to the desire of the European powers to maintain the status quo within the Ottoman Empire.<ref name=Vatikiotis66/> With Muhammad Ali's intentions clear, the European powers, particularly Russia, attempted to moderate the situation and prevent conflict. Within the Empire, however, both sides were gearing for war. Ibrahim already had a sizable force in Syria. In Constantinople, the Ottoman commander, Hafiz Pasha, assured the Sultan that he could defeat the Egyptian army.\n\nWhen Mahmud II ordered his forces to advance on the Syrian frontier, Ibrahim attacked and destroyed them at the [[Battle of Nezib]] (24 June 1839) near [[Urfa]]. In an echo of the Battle of Konya, Constantinople was again left vulnerable to Ali's forces. A further blow to the Ottomans was the defection of their fleet to Muhammad Ali.<ref name=Vatikiotis66/> Mahmud II died almost immediately after the battle took place and was succeeded by sixteen-year-old [[Abd\u00fclmecid I|Abd\u00fclmecid]]. At this point, Ali and Ibrahim began to argue about which course to follow; Ibrahim favoured conquering the Ottoman capital and demanding the imperial seat while Muhammad Ali was inclined simply to demand numerous concessions of territory and political autonomy for himself and his family.\n\nAt this point, the European powers again intervened (see [[Oriental Crisis of 1840]]). On 15 July 1840, the British Government, which had colluded with [[Austro-Hungarian Empire|Austria]], [[Prussia]], and Russia to sign the [[Convention of London (1840)|Convention of London]], offered Muhammad Ali hereditary rule of Egypt as part of the Ottoman Empire if he withdrew from the Syrian hinterland and the coastal regions of Mount Lebanon. Muhammad Ali hesitated, believing he had support from France. His hesitation proved costly. France eventually backed down as [[King Louis-Philippe]] did not want his country to find itself involved and isolated in a war against the other powers, especially at a time when he also had to deal with the [[Rhine crisis]]. So British naval forces moved against Syria, and Alexandria.<ref>Jarvis, 134.</ref> In the face of European military might, Muhammad Ali acquiesced.\n\nAfter the [[Royal Navy|British]], and Austrian navies blockaded the [[Nile delta]] coastline, shelled [[Beirut]] (11 September 1840), and after Acre had capitulated (3 November 1840), Muhammad Ali agreed to the terms of the Convention on 27 November 1840. These terms included renouncing his claims over Crete, and Hejaz, downsizing his navy, and reducing his standing army to 18,000 men, provided that he and his descendants would enjoy [[hereditary]] rule over Egypt and [[Sudan (region)|Sudan]]: an unheard-of status for an [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] [[viceroy]].<ref>Morroe Berger, ''Military Elite and Social Change: Egypt Since Napoleon'', (Princeton, New Jersey: Center for International Studies, 1960), 11.</ref>\n\n== Final years ==\n[[File:mohammed-ali-basha-mosque.jpg|thumb|[[The Mosque of Muhammad Ali]] in [[Cairo]], [[Egypt]]]]\n\nAfter 1843, fast on the heels of the Syrian debacle, and the [[treaty of Balta Liman]], which forced the Egyptian government to tear down its import barriers, and to give up its monopolies, Muhammad Ali's mind became increasingly clouded and tended towards paranoia. Whether it was genuine senility or the effects of the [[silver nitrate]] he had been given years before to treat an attack of dysentery remains a subject of debate.<ref>\"...the silver nitrate his doctors gave him earlier to cure his dysentery was taking its toll...\", Afaf Lutfi as-Sayyid Marsot, ''Egypt in the reign of Muhammad Ali'', Chapter 11, page 255; Cambridge Press, 1983</ref>\n\nIn 1844 the tax receipts were in, and Sherif Pasha, the head of the diwan al-maliyya (financial ministry), was too fearful for his life to tell the W\u0101li the news that Egyptian debt now stood at 80&nbsp;million francs (\u00a32,400,000). Tax arrears came to 14,081,500 piastres{{efn|A [[Kuru\u015f|piastre]] is forty ''[[Para (currency)|paras]]''. A ''para'' is the smallest Egyptian silver coin. In this instance, a piastre can be viewed as approximately 40% of a British pound sterling.}} out of a total estimated tax of 75,227,500 pts.<ref>Afaf Lutfi as-Sayyid Marsot, ''Egypt in the reign of Muhammad Ali'', Chapter 11, page 252; Cambridge Press, 1983</ref> Timidly he approached Ibrahim Pasha with these facts, and together came up with a report and a plan. Anticipating his father's initial reaction, \u0130brahim arranged for Muhammad Ali's favourite daughter to break the news. It did little, if any, good. The resulting rage was far beyond what any had been expected, and it took six full days for a tenuous peace to take hold.\n\nA year later while Ibrahim, progressively crippled by rheumatic pains and tuberculosis (he was beginning to cough up blood), was sent to Italy to take the waters, Muhammad Ali, in 1846, travelled to Constantinople. There he approached the Sultan, expressed his fears, and made his peace, explaining: \"[My son] Ibrahim is old and sick, [my grandson] Abbas is indolent (''happa''), and then children will rule Egypt. How will they keep Egypt?\"<ref>Nubar Pasha,''Memoirs'', p.63.</ref>\nAfter he secured hereditary rule for his family, the Wali ruled until 1848, when senility made further governance by him impossible.\n\n[[File:Tomb Muhammad Ali Pasha 2.jpg|thumb|Tomb of Muhammad Ali in Alabaster Mosque in Cairo]]\n\nIt soon came to the point where his son and heir, the mortally ailing Ibrahim, had no choice but to travel to Constantinople and request that the Sultan recognize him ruler of Egypt and Sudan even though his father was still alive. However, on the ship returning home, Ibrahim, gripped by fever and guilt, succumbed to seizures and hallucinations. He survived the journey but within six months was dead. He was succeeded by his nephew (Tosun's son) [[Abbas I of Egypt|Abbas I]].\n\nBy this time Muhammad Ali had become so ill and senile that he was not informed of his son's death. Lingering a few months more, Muhammad Ali died at [[Ras el-Tin Palace]] in [[Alexandria]] on 2 August 1849, and ultimately was buried in the imposing mosque he had commissioned in the [[Cairo Citadel]].\n\nBut the immediate reaction to his death was noticeably low key, thanks in no small part to the contempt the new w\u0101li Abbas Pasha had always felt towards his grandfather.\n\nEyewitness British consul John Murray wrote:\n<blockquote>... the ceremonial of the funeral was a most meagre, miserable affair; the [diplomatic] Consular was not invited to attend, and neither the shops nor the Public offices were closed \u2013 in short, a general impression prevails that Abbas Pasha has shown a culpable lack of respect for the memory of his illustrious grandfather, in allowing his obsequies to be conducted in so paltry a manner, and in neglecting to attend them in person.\n\n<br>...[the] attachment and veneration of all classes in Egypt for the name of Muhammad Ali are prouder obsequies than any of which it was in power of his successor to confer. The old inhabitants remember and talk of the chaos and anarchy from which he rescued this country; the younger compare his energetic rule with the capricious, vacillating government of his successor; all classes whether Turk, or Arab, not only feel, but do not hesitate to say openly that the prosperity of Egypt has died with Muhammad Ali...In truth my Lord, it cannot be denied, that Muhammad Ali, notwithstanding all his faults was a great man.<ref>F.O. 78/804. Murray to Palmerston, September 1849</ref></blockquote>\n\n== Legacy ==\n[[File:Muhammadalipasha.jpg|thumb|A portrait of Muhammad Ali of Egypt by [[David Wilkie (artist)|David Wilkie]].]]\n\nThe prevailing historical view of Muhammad Ali is as the 'Father of Modern Egypt', being the first ruler since the [[Ottoman\u2013Mamluk War (1516\u201317)|Ottoman conquest in 1517]] to permanently divest the [[Sublime Porte|Porte]] of its power in Egypt. While failing to achieve formal independence for Egypt during his lifetime, he was successful in laying the foundation for a modern Egyptian state. In the process of building an army to defend and expand his realm, he built a central bureaucracy, an educational system that allowed social mobility, and an economic base that included an agricultural cash crop, cotton, and military-based manufacturing. His efforts established his progeny as the rulers of Egypt and Sudan for nearly 150 years and rendered Egypt a de facto independent state.<ref>The 'Father of Modern Egypt' school includes: Henry Dodwell, ''The Founder of Modern Egypt: A Study of Muhammad \u2018Ali'' (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1965); Arthur Goldschmidt, Jr., Modern Egypt: The Formation of a Nation-State (Boulder, CO: Westview Press, 1988); Albert Haurani, ''A History of the Arab Peoples'' (Cambridge: Harvard University Press, 2002); Jean Lacouture and Simonne Lacouture, ''Egypt in Transition'', trans.

He was of Albanian origin rather than Egyptian, and throughout his reign, Turkish was the official language of his court rather than Arabic. Some argue that he exploited Egyptian manpower and resources for his own personal ends, not Egyptian national ones, with the manpower requirements that he placed on Egyptians being particularly onerous.

[[Fuad I of Egypt]] in the 1930s sponsored the collection, arrangement, and translation of the available historical documents relating to his predecessors, which became the Royal Archives of Egypt.

At the height of his rule, he controlled [[Lower Egypt]], [[Upper Egypt]], [[Sudan (region)|Sudan]] and [[Arabia|parts of Arabia]] and the entire [[Levant]]. Though not a modern nationalist, he is regarded as the founder of modern Egypt.\n\nMuhammad Ali was born in [[Kavala]], [[Macedonia (region)|Ottoman Macedonia]] to a family of [[Albanians|Albanian]] origins. He was a military commander in an Albanian Ottoman force sent to recover Egypt from a [[French campaign in Egypt and Syria|French occupation]] under [[Napoleon]]. Following Napoleon's withdrawal, Muhammad Ali rose to power through a series of political maneuvers, and in 1805 he was named ''[[W\u0101li]]'' (viceroy) of Egypt and gained the rank of [[Pasha]].\n\nAs ''W\u0101li'', Muhammad Ali attempted to modernize Egypt by instituting dramatic reforms in the military, economic and cultural spheres. He also initiated a violent purge of the [[Mamluk]]s, consolidating his rule and permanently ending the Mamluk hold over Egypt.\n\nMilitarily, Muhammad Ali [[Wahhabi War|recaptured the Arabian territories]] for the sultan, and [[Egyptian conquest of Sudan (1820\u20131824)|conquered Sudan]] on his own accord. His attempt at suppressing the [[Greek War of Independence|Greek rebellion]] failed decisively, however, following an intervention by the European powers at [[Battle of Navarino|Navarino]]. In 1831, Muhammad Ali [[Egyptian\u2013Ottoman War (1831\u20131833)|waged war against the sultan]], capturing Syria, crossing into Anatolia and directly threatening [[Constantinople]] but Western Powers threatened him to retreat. He did the same invasion against the Ottoman Empire in 1840 , when he defeated again the Ottomans and had a free way to capture Istanbul. Faced with another European intervention, he accepted a brokered peace in 1842 and withdrew from the Levant; in return, he and his descendants were granted hereditary rule over Egypt and Sudan. The [[Muhammad Ali dynasty|dynasty]] he established would rule Egypt until the [[Egyptian revolution of 1952|revolution of 1952]].\n\n== Early life ==\n\n<!--these paragraphs refer to \"he\", but the text shows that \"he\" is sometimes Muhammad, and sometimes Ibrahim, and maybe others.

[[Mamluk]] power had been weakened, but not destroyed, and Ottoman forces clashed with the Mamluks for power.<ref>Tom Little, ''Egypt'', (New York: Frederick A. Praeger, 1958), 57.</ref> During this period of turmoil Muhammad Ali used his loyal Albanian troops to work with both sides, gaining power and prestige for himself.<ref name=Little57>Little, 57.</ref> As the conflict drew on, the local populace grew weary of the power struggle. In 1801, he allied with the [[Egypt Eyalet|Egypt]]ian leader [[Umar Makram]] and Egypt's [[Grand Imam of al-Azhar]]. During the infighting between the Ottomans and Mamluks between 1801 and 1805, Muhammad Ali carefully acted to gain the support of the general public.<ref>P.J. Vatikiotis, ''The History of Egypt'', (Baltimore, MD: Johns Hopkins University Press, 1985), 51.</ref>\n\nIn 1805, a group of prominent Egyptians led by the [[ulema]] (scholars, savants) demanded the replacement of ''W\u0101li'' (viceroy) [[Ahmad Khurshid Pasha]] by Muhammad Ali, and the Ottomans yielded. In 1809, though, Ali exiled Makram to [[Damietta]]. According to [[Abd al-Rahman al-Jabarti]], Makram had discovered Muhammad Ali's intentions to seize power for himself.<ref name=Little57/>\n\nSultan [[Selim III]] could not oppose Muhammad Ali's ascension. By appearing as the champion of the people Muhammad Ali was able to forestall popular opposition until he had consolidated his power.\n\n[[File:Mamluks, Horace Vernet.jpg|thumb|Massacre of the Mamelukes at the Cairo citadel by [[Horace Vernet]].]]\nThe Mamluks still posed the greatest threat to Muhammad Ali. They controlled Egypt for more than 600 years, and over that time they extended their rule systematically south along the Nile River to Upper Egypt. Muhammad Ali's approach was to eliminate the Mamluk leadership, then move against the rank and file. Muhammad Ali invited the Mamluk leaders to a celebration at the [[Cairo Citadel]] in honour of his son, [[Tusun Pasha]], who was to lead a military expedition into [[Arabia]]. The event was held on 1 March 1811. When the Mamluks had gathered at the Citadel, and were surrounded by Muhammad Ali's troops, he had his troops kill them.{{efn|Reports vary about how many died. William Cleveland claims 74 killed while H. Wood Jarvis claims nearly 500. Whatever the actual number, it is clear that the event dealt a serious blow to the Mamluks.<ref>Cleveland, 67.</ref><ref>H. Wood Jarvis, ''Pharaoh to Farouk'', (London: John Murray, 1956), 124.</ref>}} After the leaders were killed, Muhammad Ali dispatched his army throughout Egypt to rout the remainder of the Mamluk forces.\n\nMuhammad Ali transformed Egypt into a regional power which he saw as the natural successor to the decaying Ottoman Empire. He summed up his vision for Egypt as follows:\n\n{{bquote|I am well aware that the (Ottoman) Empire is heading by the day toward destruction... On its ruins I will build a vast kingdom... up to the Euphrates and the Tigris.<ref>Georges Douin, ed. ''Une Mission militaire francaise aupres de Mohamed Aly, correspondance des Generaux Belliard et Boyer'' (Cairo: ''Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 Royale de Geographie d'Egypte'', 1923)</ref>}}\n\n== Reinventing Egypt ==\n\n[[File:Mouhamed ali army&navy.jpg|thumb|Muhammad Ali of Egypt establishes a modern Navy.]]\n\nSultan [[Selim III]] (reigned 1789\u20131807) had recognized the need to reform and modernize the Ottoman Empire, specifically the military, along European lines to ensure that his state could compete. Selim III, however, faced stiff local opposition from an entrenched clergy and military apparatus, especially from the [[Janissaries]], the Ottoman infantry formed from the [[devshirme]] system. Consequently, Selim III was deposed and ultimately killed in 1808. Muhammad Ali, too, recognized the need to modernize, but unlike Selim, he had dispatched his chief rivals, giving him a free hand to attempt reforms similar to those first begun by Selim III.<ref>William L. Cleveland, ''A History of the Modern Middle East'' (Boulder: Westview Press, 2013), 57.</ref>\n\nMuhammad Ali's goal was for Egypt to leave the Ottoman Empire and be ruled by his own hereditary dynasty.<ref>Cleveland, 62.</ref> To do that, he had to reorganize Egyptian society, streamline the economy, train a professional bureaucracy, and build a modern military.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">All the Pasha\u2019s Men: Mehmed Ali, his army and the making of modern Egypt, Khaled Famy</ref>\n\nHis first task was to secure a revenue stream for Egypt. To accomplish this, Muhammad Ali 'nationalized' all the [[iltizam]] lands of Egypt, thereby officially owning all the production of the land. He accomplished the state annexation of property by raising taxes on the '[[tax-farmer]]s' who had previously owned the land throughout Egypt. The new taxes were intentionally high and when the tax-farmers could not extract the demanded payments from the peasants who worked the land, Muhammad Ali confiscated their properties. The other major source of revenue Muhammad Ali created was a new tax on [[waqf]] endowments, which were previously tax-free. Through these endowments, personal income could be set aside for schools or other charitable purposes. As well as raising revenue to fund his new military, this tax took revenue away from the local elite, Mamluks and the ulama, weakening opposition to Muhammad Ali's reforms.<ref>Vatikiotis, 55; Cleveland, 63.</ref>\n\n[[File:Jean-Fran\u00e7ois Portaels - Sketch for the portrait of Muhammad Ali, viceroy of Egypt.jpg|thumb|left|''Muhammad Ali'' by [[Jean-Fran\u00e7ois Portaels]], 1847]]\n\nIn practice, Muhammad Ali's land reform amounted to a monopoly on trade in Egypt. He required all producers to sell their goods to the state. The state in turn resold Egyptian goods, within Egypt and to foreign markets, and retained the surplus. The practice proved very profitable for Egypt with the cultivation of [[long staple cotton]], a new [[cash crop]]. To help improve production, he expanded the land used for agriculture and overhauled the irrigation system, largely completed by the [[corv\u00e9e]], or forced peasant labor. The new-found profits also extended down to the individual farmers, as the average wage increased fourfold.<ref>Little, 59; Cleveland, 63\u201364.</ref>\n\nIn addition to bolstering the agricultural sector, Muhammad Ali built an industrial base for Egypt. His motivation for doing so was primarily an effort to build a modern military. Consequently, he focused on weapons production. Factories based in Cairo produced [[musket]]s and [[cannon]]s. With a [[shipyard]] he built in [[Alexandria]], he began construction of a navy. By the end of the 1830s, Egypt's war industries had constructed nine 100-gun warships and were turning out 1,600 muskets a month.<ref name=Cleveland69>Cleveland, 69.</ref>\n\nHowever, the industrial innovations were not limited to weapons production. Muhammad Ali established a [[textile industry]] in an effort to compete with European industries and produce greater revenues for Egypt. While the textile industry was not successful, the entire endeavour employed tens of thousands of Egyptians.<ref name=Cleveland69 /> Muhammad Ali used contracts called [[concession (contract)|concessions]] to build cheap infrastructure - dams and railroads - whereby foreign European companies would raise capital, build projects, and collect most of the operating revenue but would provide Ali's government with a portion of that revenue. Ali also granted [[Barth\u00e9lemy Prosper Enfantin]] permission to build technical schools modeled after the [[Ecole Polytechnique]].<ref>{{cite book|first=Zachary|last=Karabell|title=Parting the desert: the creation of the Suez Canal|publisher=Alfred A.

To staff his new industries, Muhammad Ali employed a [[corv\u00e9e]] labor system. The peasantry objected to these conscriptions and many ran away from their villages to avoid being taken, sometimes fleeing as far away as [[Syria]]. A number of them maimed themselves so as to be unsuitable for combat: common ways of self-maiming were blinding an eye with rat poison and cutting off a finger of the right hand, so as to be unable to fire a rifle.\n\n[[File:\u0623\u0633\u0631\u0629 \u0645\u062d\u0645\u062f \u0639\u0644\u064a \u0628\u0627\u0634\u0627.JPG|thumb|Muhammad Ali of Egypt with his officials in [[Cairo]].]]\n\nBeyond building a functioning, industrial economy, Muhammad Ali also made an effort to train a professional military and bureaucracy. He sent promising citizens to Europe to study. Again the driving impulse behind the effort was to build a European-style army. Students were sent to study European languages, primarily French, so they could in turn translate military manuals into Arabic. He then used both educated Egyptians and imported European experts to establish schools and hospitals in Egypt. The European education also provided talented Egyptians with a means of social mobility.\n\nA by-product of Muhammad Ali's training program was the establishment of a [[Civil service|professional bureaucracy]]. Establishing an efficient central bureaucracy was an essential prerequisite for the success of Muhammad Ali's other reforms. In the process of destroying the Mamluks, the W\u0101li had to fill the governmental roles that the Mamluks had previously filled. In doing so, Muhammad Ali kept all central authority for himself. He partitioned Egypt into ten provinces responsible for collecting taxes and maintaining order.<ref name=Cleveland69 /> Muhammad Ali installed his sons in most key positions; however, his reforms did offer Egyptians opportunities beyond agriculture and industry.\n\nA 2015 study found that Ali's economic policies had a positive impact on industrialization in Egypt.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Panza|first=Laura|last2=Williamson|first2=Jeffrey G.|date=1 February 2015|title=Did Muhammad Ali foster industrialization in early nineteenth-century Egypt?|journal=The Economic History Review|language=en|volume=68|issue=1|pages=79\u2013100|doi=10.1111/1468-0289.12063|issn=1468-0289}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Mehemed Ali Egypt.jpg|thumb|Muhammad Ali of Egypt, drawn by [[Louis Dupr\u00e9 (painter)|Louis Dupr\u00e9]].]]\n\n== Law under Muhammad Ali ==\nThe purpose of the law was to represent Muhammad Ali in his absence.<ref>All the Pasha's Men: Mehmed Ali, his Army and the Making of Modern Egypt, 133</ref> Muhammad Ali started his renovations in law by moving towards a more effective control over crime within Egypt. Most notably he did this by passing his first penal legislation in 1829, in an effort to get a stronger hold over the population. By this time, Muhammad Ali was already moving towards an establishment of an independent state, which he first expressed in 1830, by creating a state of \"law and order\", where Christians within Egypt can be safe, which was a way Muhammad Ali was able to pull influence from Europe.<ref name=\":3\">{{Cite journal|last=Fahmy|first=Khaled|date=1 January 1999|title=The Anatomy of Justice: Forensic Medicine and Criminal Law in Nineteenth-Century Egypt|jstor=3399313|journal=Islamic Law and Society|volume=6|issue=2|pages=224\u2013271}}</ref> He started gradually renovating more of the government for him to hold more sway over it rather than the sultan. He implemented a police force, mostly well known within Cairo and Alexandria, that functioned not just as a form of authority over the law, but also as a form of a public prosecutor's office.<ref name=\":3\" /> Renovation of evidence used within the courts, that previously would not be used, started to be part of the system, the biggest one being autopsy reports, becoming an important asset among investigations and trials alike.

''Lives at Risk: Public Health in Nineteenth-Century Egypt.'' Berkeley:  University of California Press, 1990. <nowiki>http://ark.cdlib.org/ark:/13030/ft5t1nb3mq/</nowiki></ref> Clot-Bey had been invited in 1827 by Muhammad Ali to found the Qasral-\u2018Ayni School of Medicine at the Army hospital of Abou Zabel which later transferred to Cairo. The Army Medical School had a difficult beginning with religious officials against dissection of corpses for anatomy lessons.<ref>M. Paul Merruau, ''L\u2019Egypte Contemporaine de Mehemet-ali a Said Pacha'',\nParis, Librarie Internationale, 1860, p. 84.</ref>\n \nThe medical school for women would produce hakimas, \"doctoress\",<ref name=\":0\" /> to treat women and children. French women adherents of the [[Saint-Simonianism|Saint-Simonian]] social reform movement were living in Egypt during 1833-36 and studied or provided medical care under Clot Bey's direction. French ''sage-femme'' (midwife) [[Suzanne Voilquin]] writes of assisting during the cholera epidemic of 1834.<ref>Voilquin, Suzanne. ''Souvenirs d'une fille du peuple: ou, La Saint-Simonienne en Egypte'', Intro by Lydia Elhadad. Paris: F. Maspero, 1978.</ref> Several of the French women contracted cholera and died.\n\nAli's military and economic goals required a healthy army and population from which young boys could be conscripted. Venereal diseases, especially syphilis, were common among soldiers and smallpox outbreaks led to high childhood mortality rates. Clot Bey argued that female-provided health care for women and children was crucial to maintain a healthy population.<ref name=\":0\" /> He believed that the untrained local dayas (midwives) were unable to provide appropriate care and under Egyptian law, male doctors could not treat women.<ref name=\":1\">Kozma, Liat. ''Policing Egyptian Women: Sex, Law, and Medicine in Khedival Egypt''. Syracuse, NY, USA: Syracuse University Press, 2011. ProQuest ebrary. Web. 24 May 2016.</ref> Clot Bey's solution was a school to train female doctors.\n\nThe school of medicine for women followed a French model. The first two years of training provided Arabic literacy in order to communicate with patients. The following four included training in: obstetrics, pre- and post-natal care, dressing wounds, cauterization, vaccination, scarification, cupping, application of leeches, identification / preparation of common medicines. Students were provided housing, food, clothes and a monthly allowance from the state.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nGraduates served at the Civil Hospital in Cairo or at health centres throughout Egypt. Some stayed at the school to serve as instructors.<ref name=\":0\" /> Marriages were arranged by the state to male doctors. Once married, hakimas were given the title of [[Effendi]], the rank of second lieutenant, and a monthly salary of 250 piasters.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nLicensed hakimas treated women and children, providing vaccinations and delivering children. They served a fundamental role in reducing the incidence of smallpox during the 19th century by vaccinating approximately 600 children a month in the Civil Hospital.<ref name=\":0\" /> They checked and treated women, mainly prostitutes, for venereal diseases.<ref name=\":2\">Fahmy, Khaled. \u201cWomen, Medicine, and Power in Nineteenth-Century Egypt.\u201d ''Remaking Women: Feminism and Modernity in the Middle East''.

In this respect, hakimas operated in legal setting. Their examination was used as evidence in cases involving unnatural death, suspected premarital loss of virginity, or miscarriage.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\nAlthough one task of the hakimas was overseeing childbirth, the majority of the population continued to use the dayas.<ref name=\":0\" /> Hakimas performed almost no deliveries and often were only called upon during difficult deliveries.<ref name=\":1\" /> However, dayas were required to have a certificate to perform deliveries, which could only be obtained from hakimas.<ref name=\":2\" /> They were also expected to report statistics on births to the hakimas.<ref name=\":2\" />\n\nA significant issue was recruitment of students. Egyptian culture at the time opposed the education of women.<ref name=\":1\" /> Therefore, the first students at the medical school were young slave girls.<ref name=\":0\" /> Slaves continued to be recruited through slave auctions as well as orphans from hospices.<ref name=\":2\" /> Despite the modest success of the school and its graduates, increasing enrolment remained a consistent problem, though the limit of 60 students was reached in 1846.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nContemporary and modern historians have viewed the creation of a school of medicine for women and the position of hakima as an example of modernization and reform for women under Muhammad Ali.<ref name=\":2\" /> Khaled Fahmy argues against this view.<ref name=\":2\" /> Fahmy states that, because the reasons for the creation of the school are primarily for the maintenance of a healthy army, the school was not a sign of reform but Ali furthering his military goals.<ref name=\":2\" /> For example, their treatment of venereal diseases was intended to curb its incidence among soldiers and smallpox vaccinations increased the pool of potential soldiers by reducing childhood mortality rate. Furthermore, the hakimas allowed for increased state control over social life. This is observed in the use of hakimas to collect statistics on childbirth, either personally or through dayas, as well as in the cases where a hakima was used to examine a woman.<ref name=\":2\" />\n\n== Role in the Arabic literary renaissance ==\nIn the 1820s, Muhammad Ali sent the first educational \"mission\" of Egyptian students to Europe. This contact resulted in literature that is considered the dawn of the Arabic literary renaissance, known as the [[Nahda]].\n\nTo support the modernization of industry and the military, Muhammad Ali set up a number of schools in various fields where French texts were studied. [[Rifa'a al-Tahtawi]] supervised translations from French to Arabic on topics ranging from sociology and history to military technology, and these translations have been considered the second great translation movement, after the first [[Arab transmission of the Classics to the West#First period: Greek \u2013 Arabic translations|from Greek into Arabic]].\n\nIn 1819/21, his government founded the first indigenous press in the Arab World, the [[Bulaq Press]].<ref>{{cite journal|last=Verdery|first=Richard|title=The Publications of the B\u016bl\u0101q Press under Muhammad 'Al\u012b of Egypt|journal=Journal of the American Oriental Society|date=1971|volume=91|issue=1|pages=129\u2013132|url=http://www.ghazali.org/articles/jaos-91-1-rnv.pdf|accessdate=22 May 2014|doi=10.2307/600448|jstor=600448}}</ref>  The Bulaq press published the official [[gazette]] of Muhammad Ali's government.\n\nAmong his personal interests was the accumulation and breeding of [[Arabian horse]]s. In horses obtained as taxes and [[tribute]], Muhammad Ali recognised the unique characteristics and careful attention to bloodlines of the horses bred by the [[Bedouin]], particularly by the [[Anazeh]] in Syria and those bred in the [[Nejd]]. While his immediate successor had minimal interest in the horse breeding program, his grandson, who became [[Abbas I of Egypt|Abbas I]] shared this interest and further built upon his work.\n\n== Military campaigns ==\n[[File:Flag of Muhammad Ali.svg|The Flag of Muhamma Ali|thumb|Muhammad Ali's flag.]]\n\nThough Muhammad Ali's chief aim was to establish a European-style military, and carve out a personal empire, he waged war initially on behalf of the Ottoman Sultan, [[Mahmud II]], in Arabia and Greece, although he later came into open conflict with the Ottoman Empire.  He used several new strategies to ensure the success of his new military. First new recruits were isolated from the environment they were used to. They began housing soldiers in barracks, leadership enforced a strict regime of surveillance, roll call was done several times a day, and corporal punishment used to ensure the new fighting force grew to become a strong disciplined military.<ref>All the Pasha's Men: Mehmed Ali, his Army and the Making of Modern Egypt</ref> The army often used the [[bastinado]] and the [[Flagellation|whip]] to control and punish the soldiers.<ref>All the Pasha's Men: Mehmed Ali, his Army and the Making of Modern Egypt 127</ref> Muhammad not only wanted his soldiers to be disciplined, he also created many military codes to regulate the definitions of crime and punishment, this helped to create blind obedience to the laws.<ref>Khaled Fahmy, All the Pasha\u2019s Men: Mehmed Ali, his army and the making of modern Egypt (Cambridge, 1997), 119\u201347.</ref> A large part of Ali's goal of a European-style military was through the creation of new labelling and organizational systems to identify soldiers, distinguish officers from enlisted men, structure units, and properly distribute salaries.<ref>Khaled Fahmy, All the Pasha\u2019s Men: Mehmed Ali, his army and the making of modern Egypt (Cambridge, 1997), 142\u2013146.</ref> Soldiers were given a unique number that identified their unit and their role within it, and officers were expected to use lists with these numbers to keep a close watch on the men and ensure every man performed his clearly assigned duty.<ref>Khaled Fahmy, All the Pasha\u2019s Men: Mehmed Ali, his army and the making of modern Egypt (Cambridge, 1997), 142.</ref> This was particularly useful in identifying deserters who often fled in the chaos of massed movement, such as during forced marches or relocation to a new encampment.<ref>Khaled Fahmy, All the Pasha\u2019s Men: Mehmed Ali, his army and the making of modern Egypt (Cambridge, 1997), 144.</ref>\nThe soldiers were placed under strict surveillance in the barracks. In order to accomplish this Muhammad Ali relied on the Bedouins to guard the troops that were sent to the training camps.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/> Despite being hired to control the troops the Bedouins were actually a menace to the government who often had to use the army to control the Bedouins.<ref>All the Pasha's Men: Mehmed Ali, his Army and the Making of Modern Egypt, 123</ref> In order to combat this the government slowly switched from using Bedouins to guard the soldiers and to capture deserters and instead attempted to set up the expectation of internment from the beginning of the soldiers stay at the training camps in order to deter them from deserting the military in the first place.<ref>All the Pasha's Men: Mehmed Ali, his Army and the Making of Modern Egypt, 124</ref>\n\n=== Arabian campaign ===\n{{Main|Wahhabi War}}\n\nMuhammad Ali's first military campaign was an expedition into the [[Arabian Peninsula]]. The holy cities of [[Mecca]], and [[Medina]] had been captured by the [[House of Saud]], who had recently embraced a literalist [[Hanbali]] interpretation of [[Islam]]. Armed with their newfound religious zeal, the Saudis began conquering parts of Arabia. This culminated in the capture of the [[Hejaz]] region by 1805.\n\nWith the main Ottoman army tied up in Europe, Mahmud II turned to Muhammad Ali to [[Ottoman\u2013Saudi War|recapture the Arabian territories]]. Muhammad Ali in turn appointed his son, [[Tusun Pasha|Tusun]], to lead a military expedition in 1811. The campaign was initially turned back in Arabia; however, a second attack was launched in 1812 that succeeded in recapturing Hejaz.<ref>Henry Dodwell, ''The Founder of Modern Egypt: A Study of Muhammal \u2018Ali'', (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1967), 43\u201344.</ref>\n\nWhile the campaign was successful, the power of the Saudis was not broken. They continued to harass Ottoman and Egyptian forces from the central [[Nejd]] region of the Peninsula. Consequently, Muhammad Ali dispatched another of his sons, Ibrahim, at the head of another army to finally rout the Saudis. After a two-year campaign, the Saudis were crushed and most of the Saudi family was captured. The family leader, [[Abdullah ibn Saud]], was sent to Istanbul, and executed.<ref>Dodwell, 48.</ref>\n\n=== Conquest of Sudan ===\n{{Main|Egyptian conquest of Sudan (1820\u20131824)}}\n\nMuhammad Ali next turned his attention to military campaigns independent of the [[Sublime Porte|Porte]], beginning with the [[Sudan]] which he viewed as a valuable additional resource of territory, gold, and slaves. The Sudan at the time had no real central authority, as since the 18th century many petty kingdoms and tribal sheikhdoms had seceded from the declining [[Sultanate of Sennar]], fighting each other with Medieval weaponry. In 1820 Muhammad Ali dispatched an army of 5,000 troops commanded by his third son, Ismail and [[Abidin Bey]], south into Sudan with the intent of conquering the territory and subjugating it to his authority.<ref>Dodwell, 51.</ref> Ali's troops made headway into Sudan in 1821, but met with fierce resistance by the [[Shaigiya]]. Ultimately, the superiority of the Egyptian troops and firearms ensured the defeat of the Shaigiya and the subsequent conquest of the Sudan.<ref>Emanuel Be\u0161ka, ''Muhammad Ali\u00b4s Conquest of Sudan (1820-1824)''. Asian and African Studies, 2019, Vol. 28, No. 1, pp. 30-56.</ref> Ali now had an outpost from which he could expand to the source of the [[Nile]] in [[Ethiopia]], and [[Uganda]]. His administration captured slaves from the [[Nuba Mountains]], and west and south Sudan, all incorporated into a foot regiment known as the ''Gihadiya'' which were composed of the recently defeated Shaigiya who now took service under the invaders in exchange for keeping their domains. (pronounced ''Jihadiya'' in non-Egyptian Arabic). Ali's reign in Sudan, and that of his immediate successors, is remembered in Sudan as brutal and heavy-handed, contributing to the popular independence struggle of the self-proclaimed [[Mahdi]], [[Muhammad Ahmad]], in 1881.\n\n=== Greek rebellion ===\n{{Main|Greek War of Independence}}\n\n[[File:Ibrahim-Mehmet-Seve.jpg|thumb|Muhammad Ali Pasha with [[Ibrahim Pasha of Egypt|his son, Ibrahim]], and [[Soliman Pasha (al-Faransawi)|Colonel Joseph S\u00e8ve (''later'' Suleiman Pasha)]].]]\n\nWhile Muhammad Ali was expanding his authority into Africa, the Ottoman Empire was being challenged by ethnic rebellions in its European territories. The [[Greek War of Independence|rebellion]] in the [[Greece|Greek provinces]] of the Ottoman Empire began in 1821. The Ottoman army proved ineffectual in its attempts to put down the revolt as ethnic violence spread as far as [[Istanbul|Constantinople]]. With his own army proving ineffective, Sultan Mahmud II offered Muhammad Ali the island of [[Crete]] in exchange for his support in putting down the revolt.\n\nMuhammad Ali sent 16,000 soldiers, 100 transports, and 63 escort vessels under command of his son, [[Ibrahim Pasha of Egypt|Ibrahim Pasha]].<ref>Dodwell, 71.</ref> Britain, France, and Russia intervened to protect the Greeks. On 20 October 1827 at the [[Battle of Navarino]], while under the command of Muharram Bey, the Ottoman representative, the entire Egyptian navy was sunk by the European Allied fleet, under the command of Admiral [[Edward Codrington]]. If the [[Ottoman Porte|Porte]] was not in the least prepared for this confrontation, Muhammad Ali was even less prepared for the loss of his highly competent, expensively assembled and maintained navy. With its fleet essentially destroyed, Egypt had no way to support its forces in Greece and was forced to withdraw. Ultimately the campaign cost Muhammad Ali his navy and yielded no tangible gains.\n\n=== War against the sultan ===\n{{Main|Egyptian\u2013Ottoman War (1831\u20131833)}}\n\nIn compensation for his loss at Navarino, Muhammad Ali asked the Porte for the territory of [[Syria]]. The Ottomans were indifferent to the request; the Sultan himself asked blandly what would happen if Syria was given over and Muhammad Ali later deposed.<ref>12 Bahr Barra, Jamad I 1243/1828</ref> But Muhammad Ali was no longer willing to tolerate Ottoman indifference. To compensate for his and Egypt's losses, the wheels for the conquest of Syria were set in motion.\n\nLike other rulers of Egypt before him, Ali desired to control [[Bilad al-Sham]] (the Levant), both for its strategic value and for its rich natural resources; nor was this a sudden, vindictive decision on the part of the W\u0101li since he had harboured this goal since his early years as Egypt's unofficial ruler. For not only had Syria abundant natural resources, it also had a thriving international trading community with well-developed markets throughout the [[Levant]]; in addition, it would be a [[captive market]] for the goods now being produced in Egypt. Yet perhaps most of all, Syria was desirable as a buffer state between Egypt and the Ottoman Sultan.\n\nA new fleet was built, a new army was raised and on 31 October 1831, under Ibrahim Pasha, the Egyptian invasion of Syria initiated the [[First Turko-Egyptian War]]. For the sake of appearance on the world stage, a pretext for the invasion was vital. Ultimately, the excuse for the expedition was a quarrel with [[Abdullah Pasha ibn Ali|Abdullah Pasha]] of [[Acre, Israel|Acre]]. The W\u0101li alleged that 6,000 [[fellahin]] had fled to Acre to escape the draft, corv\u00e9e, and taxes, and he wanted them back.<ref>Afaf Lutfi al-Sayyid Marsot, ''Egypt in the reign of Muhammad Ali'', University of Cambridge, 1983</ref> (See also: [[1834 Arab revolt in Palestine]])\n\nThe Egyptians overran most of Syria and its hinterland with ease. The strongest and only really significant resistance was put up at the port city of Acre. The Egyptian force eventually captured the city after a six-month siege, which lasted from 3 November 1831 to 27 May 1832. Unrest on the Egyptian home front increased dramatically during the course of the siege. Ali was forced to squeeze Egypt more and more in order to support his campaign and his people resented the increased burden.\n\nAfter the fall of Acre, the Egyptian army marched north into [[Anatolia]]. At the [[Battle of Konya]] (21 December 1832), Ibrahim Pasha soundly defeated the Ottoman army led by the ''sadr azam'' [[Grand Vizier]] Reshid Pasha. There were now no military obstacles between Ibrahim's forces and Constantinople itself.\n\nThrough the course of the campaign, Muhammad Ali paid particular focus to the European powers. Fearing another intervention that would reverse all his gains, he proceeded slowly and cautiously. For example, Muhammad Ali continued the practice of using the sultan's name at Friday prayers in the newly captured territories and continued to circulate Ottoman coins instead of issuing new ones bearing his likeness.<ref>Dodwell, 111.</ref> So long as Muhammad Ali's march did not threaten to cause the complete collapse of the Ottoman state, the powers in Europe remained as passive observers.<ref>Dodwell, 112\u2013113.</ref>\n\nDespite this show, Muhammad Ali's goal was now to remove the current Ottoman Sultan [[Mahmud II]] and replace him with the sultan's son, the infant [[Abd\u00fclmecid I|Abd\u00fclmecid]]. This possibility so alarmed Mahmud II that he accepted Russia's offer of military aid resulting in the [[Treaty of H\u00fcnk\u00e2r \u0130skelesi]].<ref>Cleveland, 72.</ref> Russia's gain dismayed the British and French governments, resulting in their direct intervention. From this position, the European powers brokered a negotiated solution in May 1833 known as the [[Convention of Kutahya]].<ref name= Kupchan >{{cite book | title = Power in Transition: The Peaceful Change of International Order | author = Charles Kupchan  | publisher = United Nations University Press | year = 2001 |  page = 117 }}</ref> The terms of the peace were that Ali would withdraw his forces from Anatolia and receive the territories of [[Crete]] (then known as Candia) and the [[Hijaz]] as compensation, and Ibrahim Pasha would be appointed W\u0101li of Syria. The peace agreement fell short, however, of granting Muhammad Ali an independent kingdom for himself, leaving him wanting.<ref>Dodwell, 122\u2013123.</ref>\n\n[[File:Interview with Mehemet Ali in his Palace at Alexandria, by David Roberts and Louis Hague.jpg|thumb|left|''Interview with Mehmet Ali in his Palace at Alexandria'' (1839), with [[Patrick Campbell (British Army officer, born 1779)|Patrick Campbell]] in the centre. After [[David Roberts (painter)|David Roberts]], in [[The Holy Land, Syria, Idumea, Arabia, Egypt, and Nubia]]]]\nSensing that Muhammad Ali was not content with his gains, the sultan attempted to pre-empt further action against the Ottoman Empire by offering him hereditary rule in Egypt and Arabia if he withdrew from Syria and Crete and renounced any desire for full independence.<ref name=Vatikiotis66>Vatikiotis, 66.</ref> Muhammad Ali rejected the offer, knowing that Mahmud could not force the Egyptian presence from Syria and Crete.\n\nOn 25 May 1838, Muhammad Ali informed Britain, and France that he intended to declare independence from the Ottoman Empire.<ref>Dodwell, 171.</ref> This action was contrary to the desire of the European powers to maintain the status quo within the Ottoman Empire.<ref name=Vatikiotis66/> With Muhammad Ali's intentions clear, the European powers, particularly Russia, attempted to moderate the situation and prevent conflict. Within the Empire, however, both sides were gearing for war. Ibrahim already had a sizable force in Syria. In Constantinople, the Ottoman commander, Hafiz Pasha, assured the Sultan that he could defeat the Egyptian army.\n\nWhen Mahmud II ordered his forces to advance on the Syrian frontier, Ibrahim attacked and destroyed them at the [[Battle of Nezib]] (24 June 1839) near [[Urfa]]. In an echo of the Battle of Konya, Constantinople was again left vulnerable to Ali's forces. A further blow to the Ottomans was the defection of their fleet to Muhammad Ali.<ref name=Vatikiotis66/> Mahmud II died almost immediately after the battle took place and was succeeded by sixteen-year-old [[Abd\u00fclmecid I|Abd\u00fclmecid]]. At this point, Ali and Ibrahim began to argue about which course to follow; Ibrahim favoured conquering the Ottoman capital and demanding the imperial seat while Muhammad Ali was inclined simply to demand numerous concessions of territory and political autonomy for himself and his family.\n\nAt this point, the European powers again intervened (see [[Oriental Crisis of 1840]]). On 15 July 1840, the British Government, which had colluded with [[Austro-Hungarian Empire|Austria]], [[Prussia]], and Russia to sign the [[Convention of London (1840)|Convention of London]], offered Muhammad Ali hereditary rule of Egypt as part of the Ottoman Empire if he withdrew from the Syrian hinterland and the coastal regions of Mount Lebanon. Muhammad Ali hesitated, believing he had support from France. His hesitation proved costly. France eventually backed down as [[King Louis-Philippe]] did not want his country to find itself involved and isolated in a war against the other powers, especially at a time when he also had to deal with the [[Rhine crisis]]. So British naval forces moved against Syria, and Alexandria.<ref>Jarvis, 134.</ref> In the face of European military might, Muhammad Ali acquiesced.\n\nAfter the [[Royal Navy|British]], and Austrian navies blockaded the [[Nile delta]] coastline, shelled [[Beirut]] (11 September 1840), and after Acre had capitulated (3 November 1840), Muhammad Ali agreed to the terms of the Convention on 27 November 1840. These terms included renouncing his claims over Crete, and Hejaz, downsizing his navy, and reducing his standing army to 18,000 men, provided that he and his descendants would enjoy [[hereditary]] rule over Egypt and [[Sudan (region)|Sudan]]: an unheard-of status for an [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] [[viceroy]].<ref>Morroe Berger, ''Military Elite and Social Change: Egypt Since Napoleon'', (Princeton, New Jersey: Center for International Studies, 1960), 11.</ref>\n\n== Final years ==\n[[File:mohammed-ali-basha-mosque.jpg|thumb|[[The Mosque of Muhammad Ali]] in [[Cairo]], [[Egypt]]]]\n\nAfter 1843, fast on the heels of the Syrian debacle, and the [[treaty of Balta Liman]], which forced the Egyptian government to tear down its import barriers, and to give up its monopolies, Muhammad Ali's mind became increasingly clouded and tended towards paranoia. Whether it was genuine senility or the effects of the [[silver nitrate]] he had been given years before to treat an attack of dysentery remains a subject of debate.<ref>\"...the silver nitrate his doctors gave him earlier to cure his dysentery was taking its toll...\", Afaf Lutfi as-Sayyid Marsot, ''Egypt in the reign of Muhammad Ali'', Chapter 11, page 255; Cambridge Press, 1983</ref>\n\nIn 1844 the tax receipts were in, and Sherif Pasha, the head of the diwan al-maliyya (financial ministry), was too fearful for his life to tell the W\u0101li the news that Egyptian debt now stood at 80&nbsp;million francs (\u00a32,400,000).

In this instance, a piastre can be viewed as approximately 40% of a British pound sterling.}} out of a total estimated tax of 75,227,500 pts.<ref>Afaf Lutfi as-Sayyid Marsot, ''Egypt in the reign of Muhammad Ali'', Chapter 11, page 252; Cambridge Press, 1983</ref> Timidly he approached Ibrahim Pasha with these facts, and together came up with a report and a plan. Anticipating his father's initial reaction, \u0130brahim arranged for Muhammad Ali's favourite daughter to break the news. It did little, if any, good. The resulting rage was far beyond what any had been expected, and it took six full days for a tenuous peace to take hold.\n\nA year later while Ibrahim, progressively crippled by rheumatic pains and tuberculosis (he was beginning to cough up blood), was sent to Italy to take the waters, Muhammad Ali, in 1846, travelled to Constantinople. There he approached the Sultan, expressed his fears, and made his peace, explaining: \"[My son] Ibrahim is old and sick, [my grandson] Abbas is indolent (''happa''), and then children will rule Egypt. How will they keep Egypt?\"<ref>Nubar Pasha,''Memoirs'', p.63.</ref>\nAfter he secured hereditary rule for his family, the Wali ruled until 1848, when senility made further governance by him impossible.\n\n[[File:Tomb Muhammad Ali Pasha 2.jpg|thumb|Tomb of Muhammad Ali in Alabaster Mosque in Cairo]]\n\nIt soon came to the point where his son and heir, the mortally ailing Ibrahim, had no choice but to travel to Constantinople and request that the Sultan recognize him ruler of Egypt and Sudan even though his father was still alive. However, on the ship returning home, Ibrahim, gripped by fever and guilt, succumbed to seizures and hallucinations. He survived the journey but within six months was dead. He was succeeded by his nephew (Tosun's son) [[Abbas I of Egypt|Abbas I]].\n\nBy this time Muhammad Ali had become so ill and senile that he was not informed of his son's death. Lingering a few months more, Muhammad Ali died at [[Ras el-Tin Palace]] in [[Alexandria]] on 2 August 1849, and ultimately was buried in the imposing mosque he had commissioned in the [[Cairo Citadel]].\n\nBut the immediate reaction to his death was noticeably low key, thanks in no small part to the contempt the new w\u0101li Abbas Pasha had always felt towards his grandfather.\n\nEyewitness British consul John Murray wrote:\n<blockquote>... the ceremonial of the funeral was a most meagre, miserable affair; the [diplomatic] Consular was not invited to attend, and neither the shops nor the Public offices were closed \u2013 in short, a general impression prevails that Abbas Pasha has shown a culpable lack of respect for the memory of his illustrious grandfather, in allowing his obsequies to be conducted in so paltry a manner, and in neglecting to attend them in person.\n\n<br>...[the] attachment and veneration of all classes in Egypt for the name of Muhammad Ali are prouder obsequies than any of which it was in power of his successor to confer. The old inhabitants remember and talk of the chaos and anarchy from which he rescued this country; the younger compare his energetic rule with the capricious, vacillating government of his successor; all classes whether Turk, or Arab, not only feel, but do not hesitate to say openly that the prosperity of Egypt has died with Muhammad Ali...In truth my Lord, it cannot be denied, that Muhammad Ali, notwithstanding all his faults was a great man.<ref>F.O. 78/804. Murray to Palmerston, September 1849</ref></blockquote>\n\n== Legacy ==\n[[File:Muhammadalipasha.jpg|thumb|A portrait of Muhammad Ali of Egypt by [[David Wilkie (artist)|David Wilkie]].]]\n\nThe prevailing historical view of Muhammad Ali is as the 'Father of Modern Egypt', being the first ruler since the [[Ottoman\u2013Mamluk War (1516\u201317)|Ottoman conquest in 1517]] to permanently divest the [[Sublime Porte|Porte]] of its power in Egypt. While failing to achieve formal independence for Egypt during his lifetime, he was successful in laying the foundation for a modern Egyptian state. In the process of building an army to defend and expand his realm, he built a central bureaucracy, an educational system that allowed social mobility, and an economic base that included an agricultural cash crop, cotton, and military-based manufacturing. His efforts established his progeny as the rulers of Egypt and Sudan for nearly 150 years and rendered Egypt a de facto independent state.<ref>The 'Father of Modern Egypt' school includes: Henry Dodwell, ''The Founder of Modern Egypt: A Study of Muhammad \u2018Ali'' (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1965); Arthur Goldschmidt, Jr., Modern Egypt: The Formation of a Nation-State (Boulder, CO: Westview Press, 1988); Albert Haurani, ''A History of the Arab Peoples'' (Cambridge: Harvard University Press, 2002); Jean Lacouture and Simonne Lacouture, ''Egypt in Transition'', trans.

He was of Albanian origin rather than Egyptian, and throughout his reign, Turkish was the official language of his court rather than Arabic. Some argue that he exploited Egyptian manpower and resources for his own personal ends, not Egyptian national ones, with the manpower requirements that he placed on Egyptians being particularly onerous. Taken together in this light, Muhammad Ali is cast by some as another in a long line of foreign conquerors dating back to the [[History of Persian Egypt|Persian occupation]] in 525&nbsp;B.C.<ref>The 'Foreign Ruler' school includes: Morroe Berger, ''Military Elite and Social Change: Egypt Since Napoleon'' (Princeton, NJ: Woodrow Wilson School of Public and International Affairs, 1960); William L.

[[Fuad I of Egypt]] in the 1930s sponsored the collection, arrangement, and translation of the available historical documents relating to his predecessors, which became the Royal Archives of Egypt. These Royal Archives represented the primary and, in the case of some important works,<ref>For example, Henry Dodwell, ''The Founder of Modern Egypt: A Study of Muhammad 'Ali'' (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1931)</ref> the only source of information for Egyptian history until the sharia court records became available in the 1970s. Fuad's portrayal of Muhammad Ali as a [[Egyptian nationalism|nationalist]] and benevolent monarch therefore heavily influenced the historical debate. Later, [[Gamal Abdel Nasser|Nasser]] and his revolutionary republican regime promoted an alternative narrative which portrayed Muhammad Ali as the nationalist founder of modern Egypt but also an ambitious monarch with little regard for his people whose policies ultimately benefited himself and his dynasty at the expense of Egypt.<ref>Khaled Fahmy, ''Mehmed Ali: From Ottoman Governor to Ruler of Egypt'' (Oxford: Oneworld Publications, 2009)</ref>\n\n== See also ==\n{{Portal|Egypt}}\n* [[History of Egypt under the Muhammad Ali dynasty]]\n* [[Ottoman Egypt]]\n* [[Lists of rulers of Egypt]]\n* [[Muhammad Ali dynasty]]\n* [[Muhammad Ali's seizure of power]]\n\n==Notes==\n{{notelist}}\n\n== References ==\n=== Citations ===\n{{Reflist}}\n\n=== Sources ===\n{{refbegin}}\n* Ahmed, Jamal Mohammed.
