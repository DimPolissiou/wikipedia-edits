From 1945 to late 1950s, they were considered one of the greatest teams in Europe.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.footballparadise.com/india-1950-world-cup/|quote=[Sweden] were arguably the best team in Europe when football restarted after War until the rise of the great Hungarian team of the early 1950s.

They have also made six appearances at the [[UEFA European Championship|European Championship]]. Sweden finished second at the [[1958 FIFA World Cup]], and third in both [[1950 FIFA World Cup|1950]] and [[1994 FIFA World Cup|1994]]. Sweden's other accomplishments also include a gold medal at the [[Football at the 1948 Summer Olympics|1948 Summer Olympics]], and bronze medals in [[Football at the 1924 Summer Olympics|1924]] and [[Football at the 1952 Summer Olympics|1952]]. They also reached the semi-finals at [[UEFA Euro 1992]].\n\n==History==\nSweden has traditionally been a strong team in international football, with 12 [[FIFA World Cup|World Cup]] appearances and 3 medals in the [[Football at the Summer Olympics|Olympics]]. The Swedish team finished second in the [[1958 FIFA World Cup|1958 World Cup]], when it was the host team, being beaten by [[Brazil national football team|Brazil]] 5\u20132 in the [[1958 FIFA World Cup Final|final]]. Sweden has also finished third twice, in [[1950 FIFA World Cup|1950]] and [[1994 FIFA World Cup|1994]]. In [[1938 FIFA World Cup|1938]], they finished fourth.\n\n===Early history===\n[[File:Sweden national football team 1911.JPG|thumb|The Sweden team in 1911.]]\nSweden played its first international game against [[Norway national football team|Norway]] on 12 July 1908, an 11\u20133 victory. Other matches in 1908 were played against [[England national football team|England]], Great Britain, the [[Netherlands national football team|Netherlands]] (twice) and [[Belgium national football team|Belgium]]; Sweden lost all five matches. In the same year, Sweden competed in the 1908 Summer Olympics for the first time. Sweden, however, lost a game in the Olympics against the [[Great Britain Olympic football team|Great Britain]] 1\u201312, the biggest loss in the Swedish national team's history.\n\nIn 1916, Sweden defeated [[Denmark national football team|Denmark]] for the first time.\n\nSweden played in the 1912 Olympics (as hosts), the 1920 Olympics, and in the 1924 Olympics, where Sweden took the bronze and their first medal ever.\n\n===1938 FIFA World Cup===\nThe [[1938 FIFA World Cup|1938 World Cup]] was Sweden's second qualification for the World Cup. In the first round, they were scheduled to play against [[Austria national football team|Austria]], but after [[Anschluss|Germany's occupation of Austria]], the Austrian team could not continue playing in the tournament. Instead, Sweden went straight to the quarter-finals match against [[Cuba national football team|Cuba]]. They beat Cuba 8\u20130 with both [[Harry Andersson]] (on his debut) and [[Gustav Wetterstr\u00f6m]] scoring [[hat-trick]]s. In the semi-final match against [[Hungary national football team|Hungary]], Sweden lost 1\u20135. Sweden's next match was the third-place match against [[Brazil national football team|Brazil]]. In that game the Swedes lost 2\u20134, and ended in fourth place for the first and only time in Swedish football history.\n\n===1948 Summer Olympics===\n[[File:Swedennationalfootballteamolympic1948.jpg|thumb|right|The Sweden team that won the Gold Medal.]]\nIn the first round, Sweden played against Austria. The Austrian team had qualified without their professional players, which was a surprise since the Austrian league had many professional players who were allowed to play in the tournament. The match was played at [[White Hart Lane]] in [[London]] and Sweden won 3\u20130. In the second game, Sweden played against Korea and won 12\u20130, one of the two largest margin wins Sweden has ever had. In the semi-final Sweden met their [[Denmark\u2013Sweden football rivalry|archrivals from Denmark]] beating them 4\u20132.\n\nThe final was played at legendary [[Wembley Stadium (1923)|Wembley Stadium]] in London. The attendance was around 40,000 people which was high for a football game in those days. Sweden took on Yugoslavia in the final and won 3\u20131, with goals by [[Gunnar Gren]] (24', 67'), [[Stjepan Bobek]] (42') and [[Gunnar Nordahl]] (48'). This was Sweden's first championship win in any international football tournament.\n\n===1950 FIFA World Cup===\n[[File:Sverige1950.JPG|thumb|right|The Swedish squad.]]\nIn the [[1950 FIFA World Cup|1950 World Cup]], the Swedish football association did not allow any professional Swedish football players to take part. Consequently, Sweden only fielded amateur players during the tournament.\n\nQualifying for the tournament as one of six European national teams, Sweden played in the same group as Italy and Paraguay. (India withdrew from the group.)\n\nIn the first match, Sweden beat [[Italy national football team|Italy]] 3\u20132 in [[S\u00e3o Paulo]]. The second match was a 2\u20132 draw against Paraguay. With the most points in the group, Sweden advanced to the next round.\n\nTheir first game in the second stage \u2013 also a group format \u2013 was against the hosts Brazil. It was played at the [[Maracan\u00e3 Stadium]] with a total attendance of more than 138,000, to this day the record attendance for the Swedish national team. The game ended 7\u20131 to Brazil and it is rumored that almost everyone in the Brazilian audience waved the Swedes goodbye with their scarfs.\n\nThe next game was against Uruguay, who Sweden played against for the first time in World Cup history. Played in S\u00e3o Paulo, Uruguay won the game 3\u20132, which meant Sweden were unable to play for the gold.\n\nThe final game for Sweden in the tournament was played in S\u00e3o Paulo, against Spain. Sweden won 3\u20131 with goals by [[Stig Sundqvist]] (15'), [[Bror Mellberg]] (34') and [[Karl-Erik Palm\u00e9r]] (79'). Sweden finished 3rd in the group and took their first World Cup medal.  As Sweden was the best placed European team, Sweden was, as the time, regarded \"unofficial European champions\".\n\nAt the Summer Olympics in 1952 in [[Helsinki]], Sweden continued to achieve success and won an Olympic bronze. The following year, the Football Association decided not to allow foreign professionals to play in the national team and the team failed to qualify for the World Championships in Switzerland in 1954 when Sweden only came second in their qualifying group behind Belgium.\n\n===1958 FIFA World Cup===\n[[File:Swedish squad at the 1958 FIFA World Cup.jpg|200px|right|thumb|Sweden won the silver medal at the 1958 World Cup.]]\nIn 1956, the Swedish football federation allowed the professional footballers to play for the national team again, giving Swedish football fans hope for the [[1958 FIFA World Cup]]. Sweden, the host nation, were in the same group as Mexico, Hungary and Wales.\n\nThe first game, Sweden vs Mexico, was played at Sweden's national stadium, [[R\u00e5sunda Stadium]], [[Solna Municipality|Solna]], and was attended by around 32,000 people. Sweden won the game 3\u20130, taking the lead in Group 3. The next match was against Hungary, who had finished 2nd in the 1954 World Cup in Switzerland and were also the 1952 Olympic Champions. Also played at R\u00e5sunda, this game ended 2\u20131 to Sweden, with both goals scored by [[Kurt Hamrin]]. In the next match, against Wales, Sweden drew 0\u20130.\n\nMaking it through to the quarter-finals, playing at R\u00e5sunda for the fourth time in this tournament, Sweden were up against the [[Soviet Union national football team|USSR]] and won 2\u20130.\n\nThe semifinal at [[Ullevi]], [[Gothenburg]], was the only game in the tournament which Sweden did not play at R\u00e5sunda. The crowd of around 50,000 people attended one of the best games Sweden played in the tournament. West Germany led by 1\u20130 when [[Erich Juskowiak]] was sent off in the 59th minute. Sweden won 3\u20131.\n\nThe final was played at R\u00e5sunda between host nation Sweden and the [[1950 FIFA World Cup]] runners-up, Brazil. The total attendance was approximately 52,000 people. Brazil ended up winning the World Cup for the first time ever after beating Sweden by 5\u20132. Sweden consequently became runners-up, the best result for Sweden in any World Cup. After the final match the Brazilian players honoured the host nation by sprinting around the pitch holding a Swedish flag.\n\n===1960s===\nAfter the successful 1958 World Cup, Sweden's fortunes diminished. In the qualification round of the 1962 World Cup, Sweden won its group in impressive fashion (scoring 10 goals and only having 3 goals scored against it), but it still had to win a play-off game against Switzerland to qualify. The game was played in West Berlin, and the Swiss won, 2\u20131.\n\nSweden almost got to the UEFA European Championship 1964. They started their play-off against Norway and won the first game and drew in the last game.  In the second round, Sweden beat Yugoslavia, 3\u20132, but they lost the first game. In the quarter-finals, Sweden played against the defending champions, the Soviet Union. Sweden tied the first game but lost the second.\n\nDuring the 1966 World Cup qualification, Sweden was in the UEFA Qualification group 2. Sweden started the qualification with a draw against West Germany and then a 3\u20130 victory over Cyprus. But only the winner of the group advanced and Sweden was eliminated with a loss in its next game against West Germany.\n\nSweden successfully entered the UEFA European Championship in 1968, but they finished in the Qualification group 2.\n\nSweden's only major success in the '60s was to qualify for the 1970 World Cup, after winning UEFA Group 5 ahead of Norway and France.  Sweden finished third in its group, losing a tie-breaker with eventual #4 Uruguay, and did not advance to the elimination round, however.  The winner of Sweden's group was eventual world runner-up Italy.\n\n===1974 FIFA World Cup===\nIn the qualification of the [[1974 FIFA World Cup]], Sweden was in the same group as Austria, Hungary and Malta. Sweden clinched a narrow win via a classic play off-match against Austria in a snowy [[Gelsenkirchen]], and advanced to the World Cup finals in Germany.\n\nThe group Sweden drew into included Uruguay, Netherlands and Bulgaria. The first game against Bulgaria ended in a draw. In the second game against the Netherlands, Sweden drew another tie. The last game of the round was played against Uruguay. That game was the first victory Sweden had in the tournament, when they beat Uruguay 3\u20130 with goals by [[Roland Sandberg]] (74') and [[Ralf Edstr\u00f6m]] (46', 77'). Sweden finished 2nd in the group and advanced to the second group stage.\n\nIn the second group stage, Sweden was defeated in the first game against Poland 0\u20131. The situation after the defeat against Poland was that if Sweden lost against West Germany with a single goal difference and Yugoslavia defeated Poland, Sweden would be second in the group and play for the bronze medal. But since Poland beat Yugoslavia 2\u20131, Sweden had to win the game against the host nation, [[West Germany]], in order to finish second in the group.\n\nThe game against West Germany was played in [[D\u00fcsseldorf]] with an attendance of 66,500 people. The Swedish striker Ralf Edstr\u00f6m gave the Scandinavian the lead with 1\u20130 after 29 minutes. But in the second half West Germany took control of the game, even after Roland Sandberg's equalizer after 52 minutes. Germany won 4\u20132. After the tournament, the German players commented that the game against Sweden was their best game in that tournament. The last game for Sweden was played in D\u00fcsseldorf against Yugoslavia. Sweden won that game 2\u20131. They finished the tournament as the 5th place team. The Swedish team had profiles that Ronnie Hellstr\u00f6m, Bo Larsson and Bj\u00f6rn Nordqvist.\n\nSweden did not qualify for the European Championship quarter-finals game in 1976. On 11 May 1976, Sweden lost for the first time since 1937 at home to Denmark.\n\n===1978 FIFA World Cup===\n1978 took Sweden for the third consecutive World Cup. Sweden made it from the qualifiers in a three team group with Switzerland and Norway as opponents. The qualifying session was played in 1976 and 1977 in the World Cup 1978 in Argentina, Sweden played the first match with a draw (1\u20131) against Brazil. Swedish scorer was Thomas Sj\u00f6berg. 1\u20131 was Sweden's best result so far in the World Cup against Brazil context (the result was repeated between the two countries at the World Cup finals in 1994). The team then lost against Austria (0\u20131) and Spain (0\u20131). The Swedish team finished last in the group with 1 point and goal difference 1\u20133. Several of the profiles from 1974, still with (Larsson, Edstr\u00f6m, Nordqvist) but also new players such as Anders Linderoth, Hasse Borg and Torbj\u00f6rn Nilsson.\n\n===1979\u20131990===\nAfter the successful 1970s, reaching all three World Cups, Sweden changed their coach from [[Georg Ericson|Georg \"\u00c5by\" Ericson]] to [[Lars Arnesson|Lars \"Laban\" Arnesson]]. Arnesson had been a successful coach for [[\u00d6sters IF]] before becoming national team coach. They failed to qualify to the 1982 FIFA World Cup, ending third to Scotland and Northern Ireland. In 1983, Sweden met Brazil in Gothenburg to play a friendly, the match ended 3\u20133. They failed to qualify for the [[UEFA Euro 1984]], despite defeating the then-reigning world champions Italy 3\u20130 in Naples, including two goals by [[Glenn Str\u00f6mberg]], due to losing against Romania both away and at home. The Swedish setbacks continued. After the failed qualification for the [[1986 FIFA World Cup|1986 World Cup]], [[Olle Nordin]] took over the team. Sweden lost their match against Czechoslovakia with 1-2 in the final qualifying round, while Portugal unexpectedly won 1\u20130 away against West Germany and took second place in the group. It was West Germany's first ever loss in a World Cup qualifier.\n\nSweden also failed to qualify to the [[UEFA Euro 1988]] in West Germany. They won their qualification group for the 1990 World Cup ahead of England and went on to their first World Cup in 12 years. However, the World Cup campaign ended quickly after three 1\u20132 defeats in the group stage matches, against Brazil, Scotland and Costa Rica. As of May 2018, it is the only time that Sweden has failed to score points in a World Cup tournament. After the World Cup, Olle Nordin resigned and Nisse Andersson became a temporary coach until [[Tommy Svensson]] took over in 1991.\n\n===UEFA Euro 1992===\nAs the host of the [[UEFA Euro 1992]], Sweden played in their first ever European Championship tournament. They were drawn in group A with Denmark, France and England. Sweden managed to advance as group winners ahead of the eventual champions Denmark. In the semi-finals following the group stage, Sweden were eliminated by Germany with 2\u20133. As of July 2016, the semi-final place remains Sweden's best result ever in a European Championship.\n\n===1994 FIFA World Cup===\nSweden qualified for the [[1994 FIFA World Cup|1994 World Cup]] in the United States at the top of their qualifying group ahead of Bulgaria and France. Sweden was placed in Group B with Brazil, Cameroon and Russia. The first game against Cameroon in Los Angeles looked to be yet another 1\u20132 loss, (after the [[1990 FIFA World Cup|1990 World Cup]] fiasco with losses of 1\u20132 in all three games) but in the 75th minute, [[Martin Dahlin]] scored the equalizer from a rebound shot off of [[Henrik Larsson]] and the match finished 2\u20132. In the next game against Russia in Detroit, Russia was handed an early penalty and made it 1\u20130. Sweden managed to come back, with a penalty goal from [[Tomas Brolin]] and two goals from Martin Dahlin, with the final result being 3\u20131. In the last group stage match, against Brazil (also in Detroit), they tied 1\u20131 after goals by [[Kennet Andersson]] ('23) and [[Rom\u00e1rio]] ('47).\n\nIn the first knockout-stage match, Sweden faced [[Saudi Arabia national football team|Saudi Arabia]] in the extreme heat and humidity of [[Dallas]], where the game started at the hottest time of day- 4:30&nbsp;p.m. where temperatures went past 40C (104F) in an outdoor stadium. Sweden won 3\u20131 after two goals from Kennet Andersson and one from Martin Dahlin. Sweden's quarter-final match in San Francisco against [[Romania national football team|Romania]] has become a memorable match for Swedish football fans. After Sweden had scored late in the second half, Romania managed to equalize in the dying minutes of the match, sending it into extra time. Romania's [[Florin R\u0103ducioiu]], who scored the first goal for Romania, scored his second of the day to take Romania ahead at the 101st minute. But with five minutes left, Kennet Andersson scored with a header to make it level at 2\u20132. The penalty shoot-out began with a miss from [[H\u00e5kan Mild]] of Sweden, but [[Thomas Ravelli]] managed to save two penalties from [[Daniel Prodan]] and [[Miodrag Belodedici]], giving Sweden the win and making himself a hero. Sweden advanced to the semi-finals, where they were to face Brazil in Los Angeles. They had managed to score in the group stage against Brazil but couldn't do it a second time. After Jonas Thern had been sent off with a red card, Rom\u00e1rio scored the only goal of the game in the 80th minute.\n\nIn the third-place match, Sweden played against a Bulgaria side that had lost to Italy in their semi-final match in New York City. Sweden scored 4 goals in the first half, but the second half went goal-less. Sweden finished 3rd and won the bronze medal, the best placing for the national team in a World Cup since the 1958 silver medal. This led Sweden to a second-place in the [[FIFA World Rankings]] for one month, in November 1994.\n\nThey finished as the top scorers of the tournament, with 15 goals scored in total.\n\n===1995\u20131997===\nAfter the World Cup in 1994, Sweden had difficulty reaching up to the same level. The national team was knocked out in qualifying for the 1996 European Championships in England and the World Cup in France in 1998. The qualification for the [[UEFA Euro 1996|Euro 96]] had started with a win for Sweden 1\u20130 away against Iceland in September 1994, but then lost against Switzerland away from home. In November 1994, Tomas Brolin broke his foot in a win against Hungary. In the spring of 1995 continued failure in the European Championship qualifiers. Sweden lost the away games against Turkey and played 1\u20131 draw at home to Iceland. When Sweden drew 0\u20130 against Switzerland in Gothenburg in September 1995, it was clear that the team would miss the European Championship finals.\n\nThe qualifying game for the [[1998 FIFA World Cup|France 98]] was not better. In October 1996, Austria won 1\u20130 in Stockholm and the month after the Swedes lost against Scotland on away ground. Admittedly, Sweden won against Scotland in the return match in Gothenburg on Walpurgis Night in 1997, but in September 1997 won Austria 1\u20130 in Vienna. In October 1997, Tommy Svensson quit as head coach and [[Tommy S\u00f6derberg]] took over.\n\n===UEFA Euro 2000===\nSweden qualified impressively for this tournament, winning all games except the away game against England (0\u20130) and conceding only one goal. The finals however, were a great disappointment. Sweden lost their opening game on 10 June against the host [[Belgium national football team|Belgium]] 1\u20132. [[Johan Mj\u00e4llby]] scored the goal for Sweden in the 53rd minute after an error by Belgian goalkeeper [[Filip De Wilde]], while Belgium won via goals from [[Bart Goor]] in the 43rd minute and [[\u00c9mile Mpenza]] in the 46th. Then on 15 June Sweden played 0\u20130 against [[Turkey national football team|Turkey]]. On 19 June, Sweden lost 2\u20131 to eventual runners-up [[Italy national football team|Italy]] in the last group stage match. [[Luigi Di Biagio]] scored with a header on a corner kick in the first half to give Italy the lead. Late in the second half, [[Henrik Larsson]] equalized to 1\u20131. But after [[Daniel Andersson (footballer, born 1977)|Daniel Andersson]] lost control of the ball, [[Alessandro Del Piero]] shot it into the top corner. Sweden finished the group last behind Belgium with only 1 point. Italy finished first and Turkey second.\n\n===2002 FIFA World Cup===\n{{further|2002 FIFA World Cup Group F}}\nSweden qualified undefeated for the [[2002 FIFA World Cup]], ahead of eventual third placed Turkey. Sweden was drawn in the \"[[group of death]]\", [[2002 FIFA World Cup Group F|Group F]], which also featured big favourites [[Argentina national football team|Argentina]], [[England national football team|England]] and [[Nigeria national football team|Nigeria]]. The first match was against England on 2 June. [[Sol Campbell]] gave England the lead in the first half by heading in a left-side corner from [[David Beckham]]. The equalizing goal was scored by midfielder [[Niclas Alexandersson]], a powerful left-foot shot from outside the box past [[David Seaman]]. The match ended 1\u20131. In the next game on 7 June, Sweden played Nigeria. [[Julius Aghahowa]] gave Nigeria the lead by heading in a cross from the right. Sweden managed to equalize with a goal by [[Henrik Larsson]]. Later in the game, Larsson was fouled in the penalty area and Sweden were awarded with a penalty which Larsson himself put in the goal. Sweden won 2\u20131.\n\nIn the final group match on 12 June, Sweden played Argentina, who needed to win after losing 0\u20131 to England in the previous game. Sweden midfielder [[Anders Svensson]] scored a freekick goal from 30 meters. [[Andreas Andersson (footballer, born 1974)|Andreas Andersson]] had a shot off the crossbar and out in an attempt to extend the lead. [[Mattias Jonson]] committed a foul in the penalty area and Argentina was awarded a penalty. [[Ariel Ortega]] shot straight on [[Magnus Hedman]], the Swedish keeper, but [[Hern\u00e1n Crespo]] rushed into the box and shot the rebound from Hedman between the keeper's legs. The goal was controversial because Crespo began running into the box at the same time as Ortega stepped up to shoot. However, the match ended 1\u20131 and Sweden won the group, England on second place, Argentina third and Nigeria last.\n\n{{further|2002 FIFA World Cup knockout stage}}\nIn the round of 16 on 16 June, Sweden played [[Senegal national football team|Senegal]]. Henrik Larsson gave Sweden an early lead by heading in a corner from Anders Svensson. Senegal equalized through [[Henri Camara]]. They also had a goal disallowed for offside. The game came to sudden death golden goal. Rising star [[Zlatan Ibrahimovi\u0107]] came on and nearly won Sweden the game. He made a terrific run on the right wing past several Senegal players, and shot with his weaker left foot from a tight angle straight at Senegal's keeper [[Tony Sylva]]. Ibrahimovi\u0107 had Larsson and Svensson in excellent positions for a pass, but shot instead. Then Svensson made a great spin past a defender and hit the post with a powerful shot, which Sylva would have had no chance of saving, had it gone inside the posts. Camara then took a weak shot which went past Hedman, off the post and into the goal. Consequently, Sweden were eliminated. Henrik Larsson announced his retirement from the national team after the tournament.\n\n===UEFA Euro 2004===\n[[File:Henrik Larsson Euro 2004.jpg|thumb|right|Sweden's [[Henrik Larsson]] taking a free kick against [[Netherlands national football team|the Netherlands]] in the [[UEFA Euro 2004]] quarter-finals.]]\nDespite another impressive qualifying campaign and the unexpected return of Henrik Larsson, Sweden came into the tournament in Portugal with low expectations. But after a dazzling 5\u20130 win against [[Bulgaria national football team|Bulgaria]] on 14 June, they became one of the favorites. Fredrik Ljungberg began the goal-fest after a well done pass by Zlatan Ibrahimovi\u0107. Henrik Larsson scored 2\u20130 and 3\u20130 in the second half. His first goal was a diving header after a perfectly taken crossball from the left by [[Erik Edman]]. 4\u20130 was scored by Zlatan Ibrahimovi\u0107 on a penalty and the substitute [[Marcus Allb\u00e4ck]] scored the last goal of the game. After the 5\u20130 victory, Sweden became a feared team in the tournament and many were surprised by Sweden's offensive play since they were known to mostly play a defensive form of football.\n\nIn the next game on 18 June, they were set up against [[Italy national football team|Italy]], who would prove themselves as a very hard opponent. After 36 minutes [[Antonio Cassano]] scored the first goal of the game for Italy after a cross by [[Christian Panucci]]. A great game by Swedish goalkeeper [[Andreas Isaksson]] made Sweden survive the rest of the game and after 84 minutes, Zlatan Ibrahimovi\u0107 scored a backheel goal to make it 1\u20131, which became the final score.\n\nSweden's last game of the group was held against [[Denmark national football team|Denmark]]. It was said before the game that if Sweden and Denmark played 2\u20132, Italy would be eliminated from the tournament. This is exactly what happened. Denmark led the game by 2\u20131 for a long time. But at the end of the game, [[Mattias Jonson]] scored the equalizer after numerous rebounds. Italy was eliminated and both Denmark and Sweden was qualified for the quarter-finals.\n\nIn the quarter-finals on 26 June, Sweden played against Holland. The game became goalless after full-time, but not without a lot of chances. The closest Sweden came to scoring was through [[Freddie Ljungberg|Fredrik Ljungberg]] but he hit the post with a well taken shot. Henrik Larsson also hit the cross bar from close range. After a goalless extra time, the game went to a penalty shootout. After a long run of penalties were taken, it was [[Olof Mellberg]]'s turn to take a shot. The Dutch goalkeeper [[Edwin van der Sar]] saved Mellberg's shot and Sweden lost the penalty shoot out after [[Arjen Robben]] converted the following penalty.\n\n[[File:Swedish national football team 2006.jpg|thumb|Swedish national team of 2006.]]\n\n===2006 FIFA World Cup===\nSweden qualified for the World Cup as the best runner-up, behind [[Croatia national football team|Croatia]], who won their qualifying group. At the World Cup draw in December 2005, Sweden were drawn in [[2006 FIFA World Cup Group B|Group B]] together with [[England national football team|England]], [[Paraguay national football team|Paraguay]] and [[Trinidad and Tobago national football team|Trinidad and Tobago]]. Their squad for the tournament featured players who played club football in eleven different nations.\t\nSweden started the World Cup slowly, recording a goal-less draw on 10 June in Dortmund against unheralded [[Trinidad and Tobago national football team|Trinidad and Tobago]], despite playing with a one-man advantage for most of the game. The second game, against [[Paraguay national football team|Paraguay]] on 15 June in Berlin, looked to be another goal-less draw until Freddie Ljungberg scored with a header in the 89th minute to give Sweden a 1\u20130 victory. On 20 June, Sweden played their last group stage match against [[England national football team|England]] in Cologne. [[Joe Cole]] scored 1\u20130 for England with a spectacular long range shot in the 34th minute. [[Marcus Allb\u00e4ck]] equalized to 1\u20131 with a header in the 51st minute. When [[Steven Gerrard]] scored with a header in the 85th minute, it looked like England would win the game. However, Henrik Larsson made it 2\u20132 from close range in the 90th minute. The draw was enough for Sweden to go through to the round of 16. On 24 June, Sweden's World Cup run came to an end with a 2\u20130 defeat to the host nation, [[Germany national football team|Germany]] in Munich, after two early goals by [[Lukas Podolski]]. Defender [[Teddy Lu\u010di\u0107]] was controversely sent off by referee [[Carlos Eug\u00eanio Simon|Carlos Simon]], who was captured laughing while holding up a questionable red card. Henrik Larsson missed a penalty kick early in the second half. After the tournament, [[Mattias Jonson]] and Teddy Lu\u010di\u0107 announced they had retired from the national team. On 17 July, Henrik Larsson retired for a second time from the national team.\n\n===UEFA Euro 2008 and 2010 FIFA World Cup qualifiers===\n[[File:Espa\u00f1a Suecia inicio.jpg|thumb|right|Sweden and [[Spain national football team|Spain]] meet in [[UEFA Euro 2008 Group D]].]]\nSweden finished second in [[UEFA Euro 2008 qualifying#Group F|Group F]] behind [[Spain national football team|Spain]], and qualified for the [[UEFA Euro 2008|finals]] as the best runner up. The qualifying campaign included an [[UEFA Euro 2008 qualifier fan attack|abandoned match]] away to Denmark, for which Sweden were awarded a 3\u20130 win by UEFA.\n\nPrior to the final tournament, Henrik Larsson made another sensational return to the national team, nearly aged 37. Sweden were drawn in Group D together with Spain, Greece and Russia. In their first match in [[UEFA Euro 2008|Euro 2008]] on 10 June, they beat the reigning European champions, [[Greece national football team|Greece]], by a score of 2\u20130 with goals from Zlatan Ibrahimovi\u0107 and [[Petter Hansson]]. Their next game was against Spain on 14 June. The game looked like a draw until a 92nd-minute strike from [[David Villa]], which put the Spaniards ahead. In the final group match on 18 June, the Swedes went on to lose 2\u20130 to the Russians, eliminating them from the tournament. [[Freddie Ljungberg]], [[Marcus Allb\u00e4ck]] and [[Niclas Alexandersson]] all chose to retire from the national team after Sweden was eliminated.\n\nThe [[2010 FIFA World Cup qualification]] ended disastrously for Sweden. In the first game in [[Tirana]], they were only able to tie 0\u20130 with an Albanian side that they were expected to defeat easily. Four days later, Sweden beat Hungary, 2\u20131, with goals from [[Kim K\u00e4llstr\u00f6m]] and [[Samuel Holm\u00e9n]]. They would go on to tie with Portugal twice, both in [[Stockholm]] and in [[Porto]]. Both games ended 0\u20130. Sweden would lose to Denmark on home ground with an early strike from [[Thomas Kahlenberg]] after a defensive mistake by [[Mikael Nilsson (footballer, born 1978)|Mikael Nilsson]]. [[Kim K\u00e4llstr\u00f6m]] had a penalty kick saved early in the first half, which proved to be decisive. Sweden recovered with a 4\u20130 hammering of Malta. Against Hungary and Malta, both of the winning goals for Sweden were scored late. They would lose to Denmark again at [[Parken Stadium]] in Copenhagen after a late goal from [[Jakob Poulsen]]. Meanwhile, Portugal defeated Hungary, 3\u20130, putting the Portuguese team ahead in the standings. Sweden would defeat Albania, 4\u20131; however, Sweden was eliminated by Portugal's 4\u20130 defeat of Malta. [[Lars Lagerb\u00e4ck]] resigned and [[Erik Hamr\u00e9n]] was appointed the next head coach. Several veteran players chose to retire after Sweden failed to reach the World Cup, including [[Daniel Andersson (footballer, born 1977)|Daniel Andersson]], [[Mikael Nilsson (footballer, born 1978)|Mikael Nilsson]] and [[Henrik Larsson]], his third and final retirement. Zlatan Ibrahimovi\u0107 took a break from the national team due to Sweden missing the World Cup. He returned almost a year later, in August 2010, and was named Sweden captain by the new coach Hamr\u00e9n.\n\n===UEFA Euro 2012 and 2014 FIFA World Cup qualifiers===\n[[File:FIFA World Cup-qualification 2014 - Austria vs Sweden 2013-06-07 (003).jpg|thumb|right|250px|The Swedish team before playing against [[Austria national football team|Austria]] in 2013 during the [[2014 FIFA World Cup]] [[2014 FIFA World Cup qualification|qualifiers]].]]\nSweden's [[UEFA Euro 2012|Euro 2012]] campaign with their new coach, [[Erik Hamr\u00e9n]], started well with two consecutive wins in [[UEFA Euro 2012 qualifying Group E|Group E]] against [[Hungary national football team|Hungary]] and [[San Marino national football team|San Marino]]. After that Sweden lost to the Netherlands in Amsterdam with 1\u20134, but then won against Moldova first in Stockholm with 2\u20131 and later in [[Chi\u0219in\u0103u]] with 4\u20131. After the battle against Moldova Sweden beat their neighbor Finland with 5\u20130. The following game was a defeat when Hungary through Rudolf scored 2\u20131 home at Stadium Pusk\u00e1s Ferenc at the last minute of full-time. After that Sweden defeated San Marino with 5\u20130 away including two goals from [[Christian Wilhelmsson]], who before the two games against San Marino and Hungary hadn't been a regular in the starting eleven during Hamr\u00e9ns tenure as head coach. The Swedish team then proceeded to beat Finland with 2\u20131 and in the final game beat the Netherlands with 3\u20132 to end their streak of 17 consecutive qualification-game wins. On 2 December 2011, Sweden were drawn into Group D alongside [[England national football team|England]], [[Ukraine national football team|Ukraine]] and [[France national football team|France]] in the Euro 2012 competition.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.uefa.com/uefaeuro2012/news/newsid=1692248.html |title=December date for EURO finals draw in Kyiv |work=[[UEFA]] |date=3 October 2011}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.uefa.com/news/newsid=1725325.html |title=EURO draw throws up fascinating group tests |work=UEFA |date=2 December 2011}}</ref>\n\nSweden played their opening match on 11 June against Ukraine.

A notable result during group play was their match in Germany on 16 October 2012 where they fought back from 4\u20130 down with 30 minutes remaining to draw the game 4\u20134 at the [[Olympiastadion (Berlin)|Olympiastadion]], and was widely regarded as one of the most memorable comebacks in football history.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.com/sport/0/football/19971379 |title=World Cup qualifiers: Sweden fightback stuns Germany |work=[[BBC]] |date=16 October 2012}}</ref>\n\nSweden's new national stadium [[Friends Arena]] in Solna was opened on 14 November 2012 with a friendly match against England, which Sweden won 4\u20132. Zlatan Ibrahimovi\u0107 scored four goals in a world class performance. His fourth goal was an extraordinary overhead bicycle kick from 35 yards, which later won the [[FIFA Pusk\u00e1s Award]] for goal of the year.\n\nA key win in their group was the home game against [[Austria national football team|Austria]] on 11 October 2013, as [[Martin Olsson]] and Zlatan Ibrahimovi\u0107 both scored in the second half to secure the win at the [[Friends Arena]].<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.fifa.com/worldcup/preliminaries/europe/matches/round=258374/match=300182483/report.html |title=Europe Sweden 2:1 Austria |work=FIFA |date=11 October 2013}}</ref>\n\nUsing the October 2013 [[FIFA World Rankings]], Sweden was ranked 25th overall and would face one of the four highest ranked teams in the second round of qualification.

[[Cristiano Ronaldo]] scored the only goal in a 1\u20130 win for Portugal the first match in [[Lisbon]] on 15 November. \nThe return match was played on 19 November at Friends Arena in [[Solna Municipality|Solna]]. After Ronaldo scored 1-0 for Portugal, Zlatan Ibrahimovi\u0107 scored two quick goals to make it 2\u20132 on aggregate. Sweden still needed to score a third goal because of Portugal's away goal. However, Ronaldo scored two more counter-attack goals and Portugal won the game 3\u20132 and 4\u20132 on aggregate. This meant that Sweden once again failed to qualify for the [[FIFA World Cup|World Cup]].

Sweden then bounced back to win their final two group games against Liechtenstein and Moldova with the scoreline being 2\u20130 on both occasions. They finished their group in third position behind Austria and Russia and qualified for the playoffs. Sweden were drawn against big rivals [[Denmark national football team|Denmark]] and won 4\u20133 on aggregate, qualifying for the [[UEFA Euro 2016]].

It was R\u00e5sunda stadium and Valhalla stadium in Gothenburg that were the first football fields with grass used for Swedish football.\nThe stadium was expanded during 1937, to a capacity of 40,000 people.\nThe stadium was used for the football tournament in the 1912 Summer Olympics held in Stockholm, and hosted 8 games during the FIFA World Cup 1958. In the UEFA European Championship in 1992, the stadium hosted 4 games and in the 1995 FIFA Women's World Cup it hosted only the final game. But R\u00e5sunda stadium is still the only stadium in Scandinavia that has hosted four big tournaments.\n[[Ullevi]] in [[Gothenburg]] is used for some games which Sweden plays, such as the centennial game of the Swedish football association, against England in 2004.\nEven other stadiums, such as [[Stadion (Malm\u00f6)|Stadion]] in [[Malm\u00f6]], are used for the national team.\n\n==Competitive record==\n\n===FIFA World Cup===\n{{main|Sweden at the FIFA World Cup}}\n[[File:Swedish National football team starting 11 1958 WC final.jpg|thumb|300px|Sweden in the [[1958 FIFA World Cup Final]].]]\n[[File:FIFA World Cup 2006 - GER vs SWE.jpg|thumb|300px|Sweden playing against [[Germany national football team|Germany]] in the [[2006 FIFA World Cup]] at [[Munich]]'s [[Allianz Arena]].]]\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align: center;\"\n|-\n!colspan=9|[[FIFA World Cup]] record\n!

international [[Association football|football]] and it's controlled by the [[Swedish Football Association]], the governing body of [[football in Sweden]]. Sweden's home ground is [[Friends Arena]] in [[Solna Municipality|Solna]] and the team is coached by [[Janne Andersson]]. From 1945 to late 1950s, they were considered one of the greatest teams in Europe.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.footballparadise.com/india-1950-world-cup/|quote=[Sweden] were arguably the best team in Europe when football restarted after War until the rise of the great Hungarian team of the early 1950s.

They have also made six appearances at the [[UEFA European Championship|European Championship]]. Sweden finished second at the [[1958 FIFA World Cup]], and third in both [[1950 FIFA World Cup|1950]] and [[1994 FIFA World Cup|1994]]. Sweden's other accomplishments also include a gold medal at the [[Football at the 1948 Summer Olympics|1948 Summer Olympics]], and bronze medals in [[Football at the 1924 Summer Olympics|1924]] and [[Football at the 1952 Summer Olympics|1952]]. They also reached the semi-finals at [[UEFA Euro 1992]].\n\n==History==\nSweden has traditionally been a strong team in international football, with 12 [[FIFA World Cup|World Cup]] appearances and 3 medals in the [[Football at the Summer Olympics|Olympics]]. The Swedish team finished second in the [[1958 FIFA World Cup|1958 World Cup]], when it was the host team, being beaten by [[Brazil national football team|Brazil]] 5\u20132 in the [[1958 FIFA World Cup Final|final]]. Sweden has also finished third twice, in [[1950 FIFA World Cup|1950]] and [[1994 FIFA World Cup|1994]]. In [[1938 FIFA World Cup|1938]], they finished fourth.\n\n===Early history===\n[[File:Sweden national football team 1911.JPG|thumb|The Sweden team in 1911.]]\nSweden played its first international game against [[Norway national football team|Norway]] on 12 July 1908, an 11\u20133 victory. Other matches in 1908 were played against [[England national football team|England]], Great Britain, the [[Netherlands national football team|Netherlands]] (twice) and [[Belgium national football team|Belgium]]; Sweden lost all five matches. In the same year, Sweden competed in the 1908 Summer Olympics for the first time. Sweden, however, lost a game in the Olympics against the [[Great Britain Olympic football team|Great Britain]] 1\u201312, the biggest loss in the Swedish national team's history.\n\nIn 1916, Sweden defeated [[Denmark national football team|Denmark]] for the first time.\n\nSweden played in the 1912 Olympics (as hosts), the 1920 Olympics, and in the 1924 Olympics, where Sweden took the bronze and their first medal ever.\n\n===1938 FIFA World Cup===\nThe [[1938 FIFA World Cup|1938 World Cup]] was Sweden's second qualification for the World Cup. In the first round, they were scheduled to play against [[Austria national football team|Austria]], but after [[Anschluss|Germany's occupation of Austria]], the Austrian team could not continue playing in the tournament. Instead, Sweden went straight to the quarter-finals match against [[Cuba national football team|Cuba]]. They beat Cuba 8\u20130 with both [[Harry Andersson]] (on his debut) and [[Gustav Wetterstr\u00f6m]] scoring [[hat-trick]]s. In the semi-final match against [[Hungary national football team|Hungary]], Sweden lost 1\u20135. Sweden's next match was the third-place match against [[Brazil national football team|Brazil]]. In that game the Swedes lost 2\u20134, and ended in fourth place for the first and only time in Swedish football history.\n\n===1948 Summer Olympics===\n[[File:Swedennationalfootballteamolympic1948.jpg|thumb|right|The Sweden team that won the Gold Medal.]]\nIn the first round, Sweden played against Austria. The Austrian team had qualified without their professional players, which was a surprise since the Austrian league had many professional players who were allowed to play in the tournament. The match was played at [[White Hart Lane]] in [[London]] and Sweden won 3\u20130. In the second game, Sweden played against Korea and won 12\u20130, one of the two largest margin wins Sweden has ever had. In the semi-final Sweden met their [[Denmark\u2013Sweden football rivalry|archrivals from Denmark]] beating them 4\u20132.\n\nThe final was played at legendary [[Wembley Stadium (1923)|Wembley Stadium]] in London. The attendance was around 40,000 people which was high for a football game in those days. Sweden took on Yugoslavia in the final and won 3\u20131, with goals by [[Gunnar Gren]] (24', 67'), [[Stjepan Bobek]] (42') and [[Gunnar Nordahl]] (48'). This was Sweden's first championship win in any international football tournament.\n\n===1950 FIFA World Cup===\n[[File:Sverige1950.JPG|thumb|right|The Swedish squad.]]\nIn the [[1950 FIFA World Cup|1950 World Cup]], the Swedish football association did not allow any professional Swedish football players to take part. Consequently, Sweden only fielded amateur players during the tournament.\n\nQualifying for the tournament as one of six European national teams, Sweden played in the same group as Italy and Paraguay. (India withdrew from the group.)\n\nIn the first match, Sweden beat [[Italy national football team|Italy]] 3\u20132 in [[S\u00e3o Paulo]]. The second match was a 2\u20132 draw against Paraguay. With the most points in the group, Sweden advanced to the next round.\n\nTheir first game in the second stage \u2013 also a group format \u2013 was against the hosts Brazil. It was played at the [[Maracan\u00e3 Stadium]] with a total attendance of more than 138,000, to this day the record attendance for the Swedish national team. The game ended 7\u20131 to Brazil and it is rumored that almost everyone in the Brazilian audience waved the Swedes goodbye with their scarfs.\n\nThe next game was against Uruguay, who Sweden played against for the first time in World Cup history. Played in S\u00e3o Paulo, Uruguay won the game 3\u20132, which meant Sweden were unable to play for the gold.\n\nThe final game for Sweden in the tournament was played in S\u00e3o Paulo, against Spain. Sweden won 3\u20131 with goals by [[Stig Sundqvist]] (15'), [[Bror Mellberg]] (34') and [[Karl-Erik Palm\u00e9r]] (79'). Sweden finished 3rd in the group and took their first World Cup medal.  As Sweden was the best placed European team, Sweden was, as the time, regarded \"unofficial European champions\".\n\nAt the Summer Olympics in 1952 in [[Helsinki]], Sweden continued to achieve success and won an Olympic bronze. The following year, the Football Association decided not to allow foreign professionals to play in the national team and the team failed to qualify for the World Championships in Switzerland in 1954 when Sweden only came second in their qualifying group behind Belgium.\n\n===1958 FIFA World Cup===\n[[File:Swedish squad at the 1958 FIFA World Cup.jpg|200px|right|thumb|Sweden won the silver medal at the 1958 World Cup.]]\nIn 1956, the Swedish football federation allowed the professional footballers to play for the national team again, giving Swedish football fans hope for the [[1958 FIFA World Cup]]. Sweden, the host nation, were in the same group as Mexico, Hungary and Wales.\n\nThe first game, Sweden vs Mexico, was played at Sweden's national stadium, [[R\u00e5sunda Stadium]], [[Solna Municipality|Solna]], and was attended by around 32,000 people. Sweden won the game 3\u20130, taking the lead in Group 3. The next match was against Hungary, who had finished 2nd in the 1954 World Cup in Switzerland and were also the 1952 Olympic Champions. Also played at R\u00e5sunda, this game ended 2\u20131 to Sweden, with both goals scored by [[Kurt Hamrin]]. In the next match, against Wales, Sweden drew 0\u20130.\n\nMaking it through to the quarter-finals, playing at R\u00e5sunda for the fourth time in this tournament, Sweden were up against the [[Soviet Union national football team|USSR]] and won 2\u20130.\n\nThe semifinal at [[Ullevi]], [[Gothenburg]], was the only game in the tournament which Sweden did not play at R\u00e5sunda. The crowd of around 50,000 people attended one of the best games Sweden played in the tournament. West Germany led by 1\u20130 when [[Erich Juskowiak]] was sent off in the 59th minute. Sweden won 3\u20131.\n\nThe final was played at R\u00e5sunda between host nation Sweden and the [[1950 FIFA World Cup]] runners-up, Brazil. The total attendance was approximately 52,000 people. Brazil ended up winning the World Cup for the first time ever after beating Sweden by 5\u20132. Sweden consequently became runners-up, the best result for Sweden in any World Cup. After the final match the Brazilian players honoured the host nation by sprinting around the pitch holding a Swedish flag.\n\n===1960s===\nAfter the successful 1958 World Cup, Sweden's fortunes diminished. In the qualification round of the 1962 World Cup, Sweden won its group in impressive fashion (scoring 10 goals and only having 3 goals scored against it), but it still had to win a play-off game against Switzerland to qualify. The game was played in West Berlin, and the Swiss won, 2\u20131.\n\nSweden almost got to the UEFA European Championship 1964. They started their play-off against Norway and won the first game and drew in the last game.  In the second round, Sweden beat Yugoslavia, 3\u20132, but they lost the first game. In the quarter-finals, Sweden played against the defending champions, the Soviet Union. Sweden tied the first game but lost the second.\n\nDuring the 1966 World Cup qualification, Sweden was in the UEFA Qualification group 2. Sweden started the qualification with a draw against West Germany and then a 3\u20130 victory over Cyprus. But only the winner of the group advanced and Sweden was eliminated with a loss in its next game against West Germany.\n\nSweden successfully entered the UEFA European Championship in 1968, but they finished in the Qualification group 2.\n\nSweden's only major success in the '60s was to qualify for the 1970 World Cup, after winning UEFA Group 5 ahead of Norway and France.  Sweden finished third in its group, losing a tie-breaker with eventual #4 Uruguay, and did not advance to the elimination round, however.  The winner of Sweden's group was eventual world runner-up Italy.\n\n===1974 FIFA World Cup===\nIn the qualification of the [[1974 FIFA World Cup]], Sweden was in the same group as Austria, Hungary and Malta. Sweden clinched a narrow win via a classic play off-match against Austria in a snowy [[Gelsenkirchen]], and advanced to the World Cup finals in Germany.\n\nThe group Sweden drew into included Uruguay, Netherlands and Bulgaria. The first game against Bulgaria ended in a draw. In the second game against the Netherlands, Sweden drew another tie. The last game of the round was played against Uruguay. That game was the first victory Sweden had in the tournament, when they beat Uruguay 3\u20130 with goals by [[Roland Sandberg]] (74') and [[Ralf Edstr\u00f6m]] (46', 77'). Sweden finished 2nd in the group and advanced to the second group stage.\n\nIn the second group stage, Sweden was defeated in the first game against Poland 0\u20131. The situation after the defeat against Poland was that if Sweden lost against West Germany with a single goal difference and Yugoslavia defeated Poland, Sweden would be second in the group and play for the bronze medal. But since Poland beat Yugoslavia 2\u20131, Sweden had to win the game against the host nation, [[West Germany]], in order to finish second in the group.\n\nThe game against West Germany was played in [[D\u00fcsseldorf]] with an attendance of 66,500 people. The Swedish striker Ralf Edstr\u00f6m gave the Scandinavian the lead with 1\u20130 after 29 minutes. But in the second half West Germany took control of the game, even after Roland Sandberg's equalizer after 52 minutes. Germany won 4\u20132. After the tournament, the German players commented that the game against Sweden was their best game in that tournament. The last game for Sweden was played in D\u00fcsseldorf against Yugoslavia. Sweden won that game 2\u20131. They finished the tournament as the 5th place team. The Swedish team had profiles that Ronnie Hellstr\u00f6m, Bo Larsson and Bj\u00f6rn Nordqvist.\n\nSweden did not qualify for the European Championship quarter-finals game in 1976. On 11 May 1976, Sweden lost for the first time since 1937 at home to Denmark.\n\n===1978 FIFA World Cup===\n1978 took Sweden for the third consecutive World Cup. Sweden made it from the qualifiers in a three team group with Switzerland and Norway as opponents. The qualifying session was played in 1976 and 1977 in the World Cup 1978 in Argentina, Sweden played the first match with a draw (1\u20131) against Brazil. Swedish scorer was Thomas Sj\u00f6berg. 1\u20131 was Sweden's best result so far in the World Cup against Brazil context (the result was repeated between the two countries at the World Cup finals in 1994). The team then lost against Austria (0\u20131) and Spain (0\u20131). The Swedish team finished last in the group with 1 point and goal difference 1\u20133. Several of the profiles from 1974, still with (Larsson, Edstr\u00f6m, Nordqvist) but also new players such as Anders Linderoth, Hasse Borg and Torbj\u00f6rn Nilsson.\n\n===1979\u20131990===\nAfter the successful 1970s, reaching all three World Cups, Sweden changed their coach from [[Georg Ericson|Georg \"\u00c5by\" Ericson]] to [[Lars Arnesson|Lars \"Laban\" Arnesson]]. Arnesson had been a successful coach for [[\u00d6sters IF]] before becoming national team coach. They failed to qualify to the 1982 FIFA World Cup, ending third to Scotland and Northern Ireland. In 1983, Sweden met Brazil in Gothenburg to play a friendly, the match ended 3\u20133. They failed to qualify for the [[UEFA Euro 1984]], despite defeating the then-reigning world champions Italy 3\u20130 in Naples, including two goals by [[Glenn Str\u00f6mberg]], due to losing against Romania both away and at home. The Swedish setbacks continued. After the failed qualification for the [[1986 FIFA World Cup|1986 World Cup]], [[Olle Nordin]] took over the team. Sweden lost their match against Czechoslovakia with 1-2 in the final qualifying round, while Portugal unexpectedly won 1\u20130 away against West Germany and took second place in the group. It was West Germany's first ever loss in a World Cup qualifier.\n\nSweden also failed to qualify to the [[UEFA Euro 1988]] in West Germany. They won their qualification group for the 1990 World Cup ahead of England and went on to their first World Cup in 12 years. However, the World Cup campaign ended quickly after three 1\u20132 defeats in the group stage matches, against Brazil, Scotland and Costa Rica. As of May 2018, it is the only time that Sweden has failed to score points in a World Cup tournament. After the World Cup, Olle Nordin resigned and Nisse Andersson became a temporary coach until [[Tommy Svensson]] took over in 1991.\n\n===UEFA Euro 1992===\nAs the host of the [[UEFA Euro 1992]], Sweden played in their first ever European Championship tournament. They were drawn in group A with Denmark, France and England. Sweden managed to advance as group winners ahead of the eventual champions Denmark. In the semi-finals following the group stage, Sweden were eliminated by Germany with 2\u20133. As of July 2016, the semi-final place remains Sweden's best result ever in a European Championship.\n\n===1994 FIFA World Cup===\nSweden qualified for the [[1994 FIFA World Cup|1994 World Cup]] in the United States at the top of their qualifying group ahead of Bulgaria and France. Sweden was placed in Group B with Brazil, Cameroon and Russia. The first game against Cameroon in Los Angeles looked to be yet another 1\u20132 loss, (after the [[1990 FIFA World Cup|1990 World Cup]] fiasco with losses of 1\u20132 in all three games) but in the 75th minute, [[Martin Dahlin]] scored the equalizer from a rebound shot off of [[Henrik Larsson]] and the match finished 2\u20132. In the next game against Russia in Detroit, Russia was handed an early penalty and made it 1\u20130. Sweden managed to come back, with a penalty goal from [[Tomas Brolin]] and two goals from Martin Dahlin, with the final result being 3\u20131. In the last group stage match, against Brazil (also in Detroit), they tied 1\u20131 after goals by [[Kennet Andersson]] ('23) and [[Rom\u00e1rio]] ('47).\n\nIn the first knockout-stage match, Sweden faced [[Saudi Arabia national football team|Saudi Arabia]] in the extreme heat and humidity of [[Dallas]], where the game started at the hottest time of day- 4:30&nbsp;p.m. where temperatures went past 40C (104F) in an outdoor stadium. Sweden won 3\u20131 after two goals from Kennet Andersson and one from Martin Dahlin. Sweden's quarter-final match in San Francisco against [[Romania national football team|Romania]] has become a memorable match for Swedish football fans. After Sweden had scored late in the second half, Romania managed to equalize in the dying minutes of the match, sending it into extra time. Romania's [[Florin R\u0103ducioiu]], who scored the first goal for Romania, scored his second of the day to take Romania ahead at the 101st minute. But with five minutes left, Kennet Andersson scored with a header to make it level at 2\u20132. The penalty shoot-out began with a miss from [[H\u00e5kan Mild]] of Sweden, but [[Thomas Ravelli]] managed to save two penalties from [[Daniel Prodan]] and [[Miodrag Belodedici]], giving Sweden the win and making himself a hero. Sweden advanced to the semi-finals, where they were to face Brazil in Los Angeles. They had managed to score in the group stage against Brazil but couldn't do it a second time. After Jonas Thern had been sent off with a red card, Rom\u00e1rio scored the only goal of the game in the 80th minute.\n\nIn the third-place match, Sweden played against a Bulgaria side that had lost to Italy in their semi-final match in New York City. Sweden scored 4 goals in the first half, but the second half went goal-less. Sweden finished 3rd and won the bronze medal, the best placing for the national team in a World Cup since the 1958 silver medal. This led Sweden to a second-place in the [[FIFA World Rankings]] for one month, in November 1994.\n\nThey finished as the top scorers of the tournament, with 15 goals scored in total.\n\n===1995\u20131997===\nAfter the World Cup in 1994, Sweden had difficulty reaching up to the same level. The national team was knocked out in qualifying for the 1996 European Championships in England and the World Cup in France in 1998. The qualification for the [[UEFA Euro 1996|Euro 96]] had started with a win for Sweden 1\u20130 away against Iceland in September 1994, but then lost against Switzerland away from home. In November 1994, Tomas Brolin broke his foot in a win against Hungary. In the spring of 1995 continued failure in the European Championship qualifiers. Sweden lost the away games against Turkey and played 1\u20131 draw at home to Iceland. When Sweden drew 0\u20130 against Switzerland in Gothenburg in September 1995, it was clear that the team would miss the European Championship finals.\n\nThe qualifying game for the [[1998 FIFA World Cup|France 98]] was not better. In October 1996, Austria won 1\u20130 in Stockholm and the month after the Swedes lost against Scotland on away ground. Admittedly, Sweden won against Scotland in the return match in Gothenburg on Walpurgis Night in 1997, but in September 1997 won Austria 1\u20130 in Vienna. In October 1997, Tommy Svensson quit as head coach and [[Tommy S\u00f6derberg]] took over.\n\n===UEFA Euro 2000===\nSweden qualified impressively for this tournament, winning all games except the away game against England (0\u20130) and conceding only one goal. The finals however, were a great disappointment. Sweden lost their opening game on 10 June against the host [[Belgium national football team|Belgium]] 1\u20132. [[Johan Mj\u00e4llby]] scored the goal for Sweden in the 53rd minute after an error by Belgian goalkeeper [[Filip De Wilde]], while Belgium won via goals from [[Bart Goor]] in the 43rd minute and [[\u00c9mile Mpenza]] in the 46th. Then on 15 June Sweden played 0\u20130 against [[Turkey national football team|Turkey]]. On 19 June, Sweden lost 2\u20131 to eventual runners-up [[Italy national football team|Italy]] in the last group stage match. [[Luigi Di Biagio]] scored with a header on a corner kick in the first half to give Italy the lead. Late in the second half, [[Henrik Larsson]] equalized to 1\u20131. But after [[Daniel Andersson (footballer, born 1977)|Daniel Andersson]] lost control of the ball, [[Alessandro Del Piero]] shot it into the top corner. Sweden finished the group last behind Belgium with only 1 point. Italy finished first and Turkey second.\n\n===2002 FIFA World Cup===\n{{further|2002 FIFA World Cup Group F}}\nSweden qualified undefeated for the [[2002 FIFA World Cup]], ahead of eventual third placed Turkey. Sweden was drawn in the \"[[group of death]]\", [[2002 FIFA World Cup Group F|Group F]], which also featured big favourites [[Argentina national football team|Argentina]], [[England national football team|England]] and [[Nigeria national football team|Nigeria]]. The first match was against England on 2 June. [[Sol Campbell]] gave England the lead in the first half by heading in a left-side corner from [[David Beckham]]. The equalizing goal was scored by midfielder [[Niclas Alexandersson]], a powerful left-foot shot from outside the box past [[David Seaman]]. The match ended 1\u20131. In the next game on 7 June, Sweden played Nigeria. [[Julius Aghahowa]] gave Nigeria the lead by heading in a cross from the right. Sweden managed to equalize with a goal by [[Henrik Larsson]]. Later in the game, Larsson was fouled in the penalty area and Sweden were awarded with a penalty which Larsson himself put in the goal. Sweden won 2\u20131.\n\nIn the final group match on 12 June, Sweden played Argentina, who needed to win after losing 0\u20131 to England in the previous game. Sweden midfielder [[Anders Svensson]] scored a freekick goal from 30 meters. [[Andreas Andersson (footballer, born 1974)|Andreas Andersson]] had a shot off the crossbar and out in an attempt to extend the lead. [[Mattias Jonson]] committed a foul in the penalty area and Argentina was awarded a penalty. [[Ariel Ortega]] shot straight on [[Magnus Hedman]], the Swedish keeper, but [[Hern\u00e1n Crespo]] rushed into the box and shot the rebound from Hedman between the keeper's legs. The goal was controversial because Crespo began running into the box at the same time as Ortega stepped up to shoot. However, the match ended 1\u20131 and Sweden won the group, England on second place, Argentina third and Nigeria last.\n\n{{further|2002 FIFA World Cup knockout stage}}\nIn the round of 16 on 16 June, Sweden played [[Senegal national football team|Senegal]]. Henrik Larsson gave Sweden an early lead by heading in a corner from Anders Svensson. Senegal equalized through [[Henri Camara]]. They also had a goal disallowed for offside. The game came to sudden death golden goal. Rising star [[Zlatan Ibrahimovi\u0107]] came on and nearly won Sweden the game. He made a terrific run on the right wing past several Senegal players, and shot with his weaker left foot from a tight angle straight at Senegal's keeper [[Tony Sylva]]. Ibrahimovi\u0107 had Larsson and Svensson in excellent positions for a pass, but shot instead. Then Svensson made a great spin past a defender and hit the post with a powerful shot, which Sylva would have had no chance of saving, had it gone inside the posts. Camara then took a weak shot which went past Hedman, off the post and into the goal. Consequently, Sweden were eliminated. Henrik Larsson announced his retirement from the national team after the tournament.\n\n===UEFA Euro 2004===\n[[File:Henrik Larsson Euro 2004.jpg|thumb|right|Sweden's [[Henrik Larsson]] taking a free kick against [[Netherlands national football team|the Netherlands]] in the [[UEFA Euro 2004]] quarter-finals.]]\nDespite another impressive qualifying campaign and the unexpected return of Henrik Larsson, Sweden came into the tournament in Portugal with low expectations. But after a dazzling 5\u20130 win against [[Bulgaria national football team|Bulgaria]] on 14 June, they became one of the favorites. Fredrik Ljungberg began the goal-fest after a well done pass by Zlatan Ibrahimovi\u0107. Henrik Larsson scored 2\u20130 and 3\u20130 in the second half. His first goal was a diving header after a perfectly taken crossball from the left by [[Erik Edman]]. 4\u20130 was scored by Zlatan Ibrahimovi\u0107 on a penalty and the substitute [[Marcus Allb\u00e4ck]] scored the last goal of the game. After the 5\u20130 victory, Sweden became a feared team in the tournament and many were surprised by Sweden's offensive play since they were known to mostly play a defensive form of football.\n\nIn the next game on 18 June, they were set up against [[Italy national football team|Italy]], who would prove themselves as a very hard opponent. After 36 minutes [[Antonio Cassano]] scored the first goal of the game for Italy after a cross by [[Christian Panucci]]. A great game by Swedish goalkeeper [[Andreas Isaksson]] made Sweden survive the rest of the game and after 84 minutes, Zlatan Ibrahimovi\u0107 scored a backheel goal to make it 1\u20131, which became the final score.\n\nSweden's last game of the group was held against [[Denmark national football team|Denmark]]. It was said before the game that if Sweden and Denmark played 2\u20132, Italy would be eliminated from the tournament. This is exactly what happened. Denmark led the game by 2\u20131 for a long time. But at the end of the game, [[Mattias Jonson]] scored the equalizer after numerous rebounds. Italy was eliminated and both Denmark and Sweden was qualified for the quarter-finals.\n\nIn the quarter-finals on 26 June, Sweden played against Holland. The game became goalless after full-time, but not without a lot of chances. The closest Sweden came to scoring was through [[Freddie Ljungberg|Fredrik Ljungberg]] but he hit the post with a well taken shot. Henrik Larsson also hit the cross bar from close range. After a goalless extra time, the game went to a penalty shootout. After a long run of penalties were taken, it was [[Olof Mellberg]]'s turn to take a shot. The Dutch goalkeeper [[Edwin van der Sar]] saved Mellberg's shot and Sweden lost the penalty shoot out after [[Arjen Robben]] converted the following penalty.\n\n[[File:Swedish national football team 2006.jpg|thumb|Swedish national team of 2006.]]\n\n===2006 FIFA World Cup===\nSweden qualified for the World Cup as the best runner-up, behind [[Croatia national football team|Croatia]], who won their qualifying group. At the World Cup draw in December 2005, Sweden were drawn in [[2006 FIFA World Cup Group B|Group B]] together with [[England national football team|England]], [[Paraguay national football team|Paraguay]] and [[Trinidad and Tobago national football team|Trinidad and Tobago]]. Their squad for the tournament featured players who played club football in eleven different nations.\t\nSweden started the World Cup slowly, recording a goal-less draw on 10 June in Dortmund against unheralded [[Trinidad and Tobago national football team|Trinidad and Tobago]], despite playing with a one-man advantage for most of the game. The second game, against [[Paraguay national football team|Paraguay]] on 15 June in Berlin, looked to be another goal-less draw until Freddie Ljungberg scored with a header in the 89th minute to give Sweden a 1\u20130 victory. On 20 June, Sweden played their last group stage match against [[England national football team|England]] in Cologne. [[Joe Cole]] scored 1\u20130 for England with a spectacular long range shot in the 34th minute. [[Marcus Allb\u00e4ck]] equalized to 1\u20131 with a header in the 51st minute. When [[Steven Gerrard]] scored with a header in the 85th minute, it looked like England would win the game. However, Henrik Larsson made it 2\u20132 from close range in the 90th minute. The draw was enough for Sweden to go through to the round of 16. On 24 June, Sweden's World Cup run came to an end with a 2\u20130 defeat to the host nation, [[Germany national football team|Germany]] in Munich, after two early goals by [[Lukas Podolski]]. Defender [[Teddy Lu\u010di\u0107]] was controversely sent off by referee [[Carlos Eug\u00eanio Simon|Carlos Simon]], who was captured laughing while holding up a questionable red card. Henrik Larsson missed a penalty kick early in the second half. After the tournament, [[Mattias Jonson]] and Teddy Lu\u010di\u0107 announced they had retired from the national team. On 17 July, Henrik Larsson retired for a second time from the national team.\n\n===UEFA Euro 2008 and 2010 FIFA World Cup qualifiers===\n[[File:Espa\u00f1a Suecia inicio.jpg|thumb|right|Sweden and [[Spain national football team|Spain]] meet in [[UEFA Euro 2008 Group D]].]]\nSweden finished second in [[UEFA Euro 2008 qualifying#Group F|Group F]] behind [[Spain national football team|Spain]], and qualified for the [[UEFA Euro 2008|finals]] as the best runner up. The qualifying campaign included an [[UEFA Euro 2008 qualifier fan attack|abandoned match]] away to Denmark, for which Sweden were awarded a 3\u20130 win by UEFA.\n\nPrior to the final tournament, Henrik Larsson made another sensational return to the national team, nearly aged 37. Sweden were drawn in Group D together with Spain, Greece and Russia. In their first match in [[UEFA Euro 2008|Euro 2008]] on 10 June, they beat the reigning European champions, [[Greece national football team|Greece]], by a score of 2\u20130 with goals from Zlatan Ibrahimovi\u0107 and [[Petter Hansson]]. Their next game was against Spain on 14 June. The game looked like a draw until a 92nd-minute strike from [[David Villa]], which put the Spaniards ahead. In the final group match on 18 June, the Swedes went on to lose 2\u20130 to the Russians, eliminating them from the tournament. [[Freddie Ljungberg]], [[Marcus Allb\u00e4ck]] and [[Niclas Alexandersson]] all chose to retire from the national team after Sweden was eliminated.\n\nThe [[2010 FIFA World Cup qualification]] ended disastrously for Sweden. In the first game in [[Tirana]], they were only able to tie 0\u20130 with an Albanian side that they were expected to defeat easily. Four days later, Sweden beat Hungary, 2\u20131, with goals from [[Kim K\u00e4llstr\u00f6m]] and [[Samuel Holm\u00e9n]]. They would go on to tie with Portugal twice, both in [[Stockholm]] and in [[Porto]]. Both games ended 0\u20130. Sweden would lose to Denmark on home ground with an early strike from [[Thomas Kahlenberg]] after a defensive mistake by [[Mikael Nilsson (footballer, born 1978)|Mikael Nilsson]]. [[Kim K\u00e4llstr\u00f6m]] had a penalty kick saved early in the first half, which proved to be decisive. Sweden recovered with a 4\u20130 hammering of Malta. Against Hungary and Malta, both of the winning goals for Sweden were scored late. They would lose to Denmark again at [[Parken Stadium]] in Copenhagen after a late goal from [[Jakob Poulsen]]. Meanwhile, Portugal defeated Hungary, 3\u20130, putting the Portuguese team ahead in the standings. Sweden would defeat Albania, 4\u20131; however, Sweden was eliminated by Portugal's 4\u20130 defeat of Malta. [[Lars Lagerb\u00e4ck]] resigned and [[Erik Hamr\u00e9n]] was appointed the next head coach. Several veteran players chose to retire after Sweden failed to reach the World Cup, including [[Daniel Andersson (footballer, born 1977)|Daniel Andersson]], [[Mikael Nilsson (footballer, born 1978)|Mikael Nilsson]] and [[Henrik Larsson]], his third and final retirement. Zlatan Ibrahimovi\u0107 took a break from the national team due to Sweden missing the World Cup. He returned almost a year later, in August 2010, and was named Sweden captain by the new coach Hamr\u00e9n.\n\n===UEFA Euro 2012 and 2014 FIFA World Cup qualifiers===\n[[File:FIFA World Cup-qualification 2014 - Austria vs Sweden 2013-06-07 (003).jpg|thumb|right|250px|The Swedish team before playing against [[Austria national football team|Austria]] in 2013 during the [[2014 FIFA World Cup]] [[2014 FIFA World Cup qualification|qualifiers]].]]\nSweden's [[UEFA Euro 2012|Euro 2012]] campaign with their new coach, [[Erik Hamr\u00e9n]], started well with two consecutive wins in [[UEFA Euro 2012 qualifying Group E|Group E]] against [[Hungary national football team|Hungary]] and [[San Marino national football team|San Marino]]. After that Sweden lost to the Netherlands in Amsterdam with 1\u20134, but then won against Moldova first in Stockholm with 2\u20131 and later in [[Chi\u0219in\u0103u]] with 4\u20131. After the battle against Moldova Sweden beat their neighbor Finland with 5\u20130. The following game was a defeat when Hungary through Rudolf scored 2\u20131 home at Stadium Pusk\u00e1s Ferenc at the last minute of full-time. After that Sweden defeated San Marino with 5\u20130 away including two goals from [[Christian Wilhelmsson]], who before the two games against San Marino and Hungary hadn't been a regular in the starting eleven during Hamr\u00e9ns tenure as head coach. The Swedish team then proceeded to beat Finland with 2\u20131 and in the final game beat the Netherlands with 3\u20132 to end their streak of 17 consecutive qualification-game wins. On 2 December 2011, Sweden were drawn into Group D alongside [[England national football team|England]], [[Ukraine national football team|Ukraine]] and [[France national football team|France]] in the Euro 2012 competition.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.uefa.com/uefaeuro2012/news/newsid=1692248.html |title=December date for EURO finals draw in Kyiv |work=[[UEFA]] |date=3 October 2011}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.uefa.com/news/newsid=1725325.html |title=EURO draw throws up fascinating group tests |work=UEFA |date=2 December 2011}}</ref>\n\nSweden played their opening match on 11 June against Ukraine.

A notable result during group play was their match in Germany on 16 October 2012 where they fought back from 4\u20130 down with 30 minutes remaining to draw the game 4\u20134 at the [[Olympiastadion (Berlin)|Olympiastadion]], and was widely regarded as one of the most memorable comebacks in football history.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.com/sport/0/football/19971379 |title=World Cup qualifiers: Sweden fightback stuns Germany |work=[[BBC]] |date=16 October 2012}}</ref>\n\nSweden's new national stadium [[Friends Arena]] in Solna was opened on 14 November 2012 with a friendly match against England, which Sweden won 4\u20132. Zlatan Ibrahimovi\u0107 scored four goals in a world class performance. His fourth goal was an extraordinary overhead bicycle kick from 35 yards, which later won the [[FIFA Pusk\u00e1s Award]] for goal of the year.\n\nA key win in their group was the home game against [[Austria national football team|Austria]] on 11 October 2013, as [[Martin Olsson]] and Zlatan Ibrahimovi\u0107 both scored in the second half to secure the win at the [[Friends Arena]].<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.fifa.com/worldcup/preliminaries/europe/matches/round=258374/match=300182483/report.html |title=Europe Sweden 2:1 Austria |work=FIFA |date=11 October 2013}}</ref>\n\nUsing the October 2013 [[FIFA World Rankings]], Sweden was ranked 25th overall and would face one of the four highest ranked teams in the second round of qualification. They were drawn to face [[Portugal national football team|Portugal]], the team that beat Sweden for a qualification spot in the 2010 World Cup qualifiers. [[Cristiano Ronaldo]] scored the only goal in a 1\u20130 win for Portugal the first match in [[Lisbon]] on 15 November. \nThe return match was played on 19 November at Friends Arena in [[Solna Municipality|Solna]]. After Ronaldo scored 1-0 for Portugal, Zlatan Ibrahimovi\u0107 scored two quick goals to make it 2\u20132 on aggregate. Sweden still needed to score a third goal because of Portugal's away goal. However, Ronaldo scored two more counter-attack goals and Portugal won the game 3\u20132 and 4\u20132 on aggregate. This meant that Sweden once again failed to qualify for the [[FIFA World Cup|World Cup]]. Due to this, Sweden's most capped player of all time [[Anders Svensson]] decided to end his international career.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.uefa.com/worldcup/season=2014/matches/round=2000295/match=2008758/postmatch/report/ |title=Ronaldo hat-trick takes Portugal past Sweden\n |work=UEFA |date=19 November 2013}}</ref>\n\n===UEFA Euro 2016===\n{{Main|UEFA Euro 2016}}\n[[File:Russia-Sweden 2015 (16).jpg|thumb|right|250px|The Swedish team before playing against [[Russia national football team|Russia]] in 2015 during the [[UEFA Euro 2016 qualifying Group G|Euro 2016]] qualifiers]]\nCompeting in [[UEFA Euro 2016 qualifying Group G|Group G]] of the [[UEFA Euro 2016]] [[UEFA Euro 2016 qualifying|qualifiers]], Sweden picked up their first point on the road in [[Austria national football team|Austria]] with a 1\u20131 draw on 8 September 2014.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.uefa.com/uefaeuro/qualifiers/season=2016/matches/round=2000446/match=2013829/postmatch/quotes/index.html|title=Ibrahimovi\u0107 pleased with Sweden point|work=[[UEFA]] |date=9 September 2014}}</ref> After a 1\u20131 draw against [[Russia national football team|Russia]] at the Friends Arena, Sweden then picked up their first win in their next match with a 2\u20130 result against [[Liechtenstein national football team|Liechtenstein]].<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.uefa.com/uefaeuro/qualifiers/season=2016/matches/round=2000446/match=2013873/postmatch/quotes/index.htmll|title=Hamr\u00e9n lauds Durmaz and Sweden's new boys\n|work=[[UEFA]] |date=13 October 2014}}</ref> Sweden then went unbeaten for another three matches before suffering two consecutive defeats, a 1\u20130 loss to Russia in [[Moscow]] and a crushing 4\u20131 home defeat to group leaders Austria. This caused Sweden to move down to third place in their group, just one point above fourth-placed [[Montenegro national football team|Montenegro]]. Sweden then bounced back to win their final two group games against Liechtenstein and Moldova with the scoreline being 2\u20130 on both occasions. They finished their group in third position behind Austria and Russia and qualified for the playoffs. Sweden were drawn against big rivals [[Denmark national football team|Denmark]] and won 4\u20133 on aggregate, qualifying for the [[UEFA Euro 2016]]. They were, however, eliminated from the group stage, losing to Italy and Belgium, drawing with the Republic of Ireland and scoring no goals of their own (their only goal was an [[own goal]] by [[Ciaran Clark]]).\n\n===2018 FIFA World Cup===\n{{Main|2018 FIFA World Cup}}\nOn 25 July 2015, Sweden were drawn in [[2018 FIFA World Cup qualification&nbsp;\u2013 UEFA Group A|Group A]] of [[2018 FIFA World Cup qualification]].

A month later, Sweden earned a point in a 0\u20130 draw against Russia in Kaliningrad. With two matches remaining, Sweden had to win both to top the group and to be promoted to the [[2020\u201321 UEFA Nations League A]]. On 17 November, Sweden beat Turkey 0\u20131 in Konya after a penalty goal from captain [[Andreas Granqvist]]. Three days later, they achieved a 2\u20130 victory over Russia in Solna. The two wins meant promotion for Sweden to League A and a guaranteed play-off spot for the [[UEFA Euro 2020]], should they not qualify directly via the regular qualification process.\n\n===UEFA Euro 2020===\nThe draw for the [[UEFA Euro 2020 qualifying]] was held on December 2, 2018.

Three days later, Sweden played the return fixture against neighbours Norway at Friends Arena in Solna. [[Stefan Johansen]] scored 1\u20130 for Norway just before half time after a mistake by Andreas Granqvist. Fifteen minutes into the second half, Emil Forsberg scored 1\u20131 which became the final result.\n\nOn 12 October, Sweden defeated Malta in [[Ta' Qali]] with 4\u20130. The debutant [[Marcus Danielson]] scored and Sebastian Larsson scored two penalty goals. These were Larsson's first international goals since he scored against France in UEFA Euro 2012. Three days later, Sweden played the return fixture against Spain at Friends Arena in Solna. Early in the second half, Marcus Berg scored 1\u20130 for Sweden with a header from close range.

The win meant that Sweden had secured second place in the group and a spot at UEFA Euro 2020, their sixth consecutive European championship.\n\nThe draw for the final tournament was held on 30 November 2019 in Bucharest, Romania. Sweden were seeded in pot 3 and drawn in Group E together with Spain from pot 1, [[Poland national football team|Poland]] from pot 2 and Play-Off Winner Path B from pot 4.

The first competitive match between the countries was as 1\u20130 win for Sweden in the group stage of [[UEFA Euro 1992]]. Both teams advanced from the group stage and Denmark went on to win the tournament. In [[UEFA Euro 2004]] the teams drew 2\u20132 in the last group stage match, ensuring that both teams advanced at the expense of [[Italy national football team|Italy]].

Chawla was the first Indian woman to fly in space. She spoke the following words while traveling in the weightlessness of space, \"You are just your intelligence.\" On her first mission, Chawla traveled over 10.4 million miles (16737177.6&nbsp;km) in 252 orbits of the earth, logging more than 372 hours (15 days and 12 hours) in space.<ref name=\"NASAbio\">{{cite web|url=http://www.jsc.nasa.gov/Bios/htmlbios/chawla.html|title=Kalpana Chawla (PH.D)|work=Biographical Data|publisher=NASA|accessdate=September 14, 2014}}</ref> During STS-87, she was responsible for deploying the Spartan satellite which malfunctioned, necessitating a spacewalk by [[Winston Scott]] and [[Takao Doi]] to capture the satellite. A five-month NASA investigation fully exonerated {{citation needed|date=April 2018}} Chawla by identifying errors in software interfaces and the defined procedures of flight crew and ground control. After the completion of [[STS-87]] post-flight activities, Chawla was assigned to technical positions in the astronaut office to work on the space station.\n\n=== Second space mission ===\nIn 2001, Chawla was selected for her second flight as part of the crew of [[STS-107]]. This mission was repeatedly delayed due to scheduling conflicts and technical problems such as the July 2002 discovery of cracks in the shuttle engine flow liners. On January 16, 2003, Chawla finally returned to space aboard [[Space Shuttle Columbia|Space Shuttle ''Columbia'']] on the [[Space Shuttle Columbia disaster|ill-fated STS-107 mission]].

He was knocked out in the 14th round of a 15 round fight by Archie Hughes of [[New South Wales]]. Johns had played junior football for [[Richmond Bulldogs|Richmond]] since the age of 13 where he was a halfback. He had been in the seventh grade team which had won the championship and he repeated this feat in the following two years. In 1931 he was in the Third Intermediate grade which won the grade and he was promoted to the reserve grade team in 1932. His form was so good that he was promoted to the senior side and made the Probables versus Possibles match which played at [[Carlaw Park]] on 23 July. He was regarded as a certainty to gain higher honours in the future. Johns was originally from the [[West Coast, New Zealand|West Coast]] of the [[South Island]] and was the oldest in a family of four.<ref>{{cite news\n| title =Boxer\u2019s Death/Collapse in Ring\n| page = 9\n| work=[[Auckland Star]]| volume=LXIII| issue=235\n| date = 1932-10-04\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/AS19321004.2.106\n| accessdate = 2019-11-11}}</ref> Several articles were published in ''[[The New Zealand Herald]]'' and the ''[[Auckland Star]]'' newspapers on his life and death.<ref>{{cite news\n| title =Fatal Boxing Bout/Death of Harry Johns/Tragic Ending to Match/Adjournment of Inquest/Brilliant Sporting Career\n| page = 5\n| work=[[The New Zealand Herald]]| volume=LXIX| issue=21305\n| date = 1932-10-05\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/NZH19321005.2.121\n| accessdate = 2019-11-11}}</ref> It was later reported that he had sustained a concussion in the Probables v Possibles match and bled from the nose along with requiring stitches in his head. He fought in [[Hastings, New Zealand|Hastings]] shortly afterwards and lost. Johns then complained of feeling unwell and produced a medical certificate that he was not fit to fight. However he carried on playing league in the interim until beginning training for the fatal bout.

This meant that the senior match was 20 minutes late kicking off and the players involved were suspended by their club.<ref>{{cite news\n| title =Team Suspended/Ponsonby League Club/Reserve Players\u2019 Defiance\n| page =9\n| work=[[Auckland Star]]| volume=LXIII| issue=193\n| date = 1932-08-16\n| url = https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/AS19320816.2.139\n| accessdate = 2019-11-10}}</ref> The coach, Mr. F.

The Round 5 results were not reported, and the Round 9 match between [[Newton Rangers|Newton]] and [[Richmond Bulldogs|Richmond]] was not reported though Richmond were the winners. They were also the winners of the Round 5 match over [[North Shore Albions|Devonport]] which was crucial in enabling them to win the championship.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable mw-collapsible\"\n|+ class=\"nowrap\" | 1932 Senior Reserve Results\n|-\n|\n! scope=\"col\" | Date\n! scope=\"col\" |\n! scope=\"col\" | Score\n! scope=\"col\" |\n! scope=\"col\" | Score\n! scope=\"col\" | Venue\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | Round 1\n| 30 Apr <ref>{{cite news\n| title =Opening Games Played/Devonport Beats Ponsonby/Surprise Win for Richmond\n| page = 13\n| work=[[The New Zealand Herald]]| volume=LXIX| issue=21171\n| date = 1932-05-02\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/NZH19320502.2.158.2\n| accessdate = 2019-11-04}}</ref>\n|| Ponsonby || 6 || Devonport || 0 || Carlaw Park # 1, 1:45pm\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | \u2013\n| 30 Apr || City || 8 || Newton || 7 || Auckland Domain # 2, 2pm\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | \u2013\n| 30 Apr || Richmond || 5 || Marist || 0 || Carlaw Park # 2, 2pm\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | Round 2\n| 14 May <ref>{{cite news\n| title =Lower Grade Results\n| page = 7\n| work=[[The New Zealand Herald]]| volume=LXIX| issue=21184\n| date = 1932-05-17\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/NZH19320517.2.28.2\n| accessdate = 2019-11-11}}</ref>\n|| Richmond || 3 || Devonport || 2 || Auckland Domain # 2, 1:30pm\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | \u2013\n| 14 May || Marist || 20 || City || 0 || Auckland Domain # 3, 3pm\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | \u2013\n| 14 May || Ponsonby || 36 || Newton|| 6 || Carlaw Park # 2, 1:30pm\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | Round 3\n| 21 May <ref>{{cite news\n| title =Senior Competition Games/Marist Defeats Ponsonby/Newton Creates Surprise\n| page = 12\n| work=[[The New Zealand Herald]]| volume=LXIX| issue=21189\n| date = 1932-05-23\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/NZH19320523.2.144.3\n| accessdate = 2019-11-05}}</ref>\n|| Ponsonby || 3 || Marist || 2 || Auckland Domain # 2, 1:30pm\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | \u2013\n| 21 May || Richmond || 18 || City || 2 || Carlaw Park # 2, 1:30pm\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | \u2013\n| 21 May || Devonport || 20 || Newton || 3 || Auckland Domain # 2, 3pm\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | Round 4\n| 28 May <ref>{{cite news\n| title =Lower Grade Results\n| page = 12\n| work=[[The New Zealand Herald]]| volume=LXIX| issue=21195\n| date = 1932-05-30\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/NZH19320530.2.139.4\n| accessdate = 2019-11-06}}</ref>\n|| Marist || 15 || Devonport || 5 || Carlaw Park # 2, 1:30pm\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | \u2013\n| 28 May || Richmond || 6 || Newton || 3 || Auckland Domain, 1:30pm\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | \u2013\n| 28 May || Ponsonby || 10 || City || 2 || Auckland Domain, 3pm\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | Round 5\n| 4 June|| Newton || ?

They were the dominant team and their only loss came in the final round when they had already secured their second title first having won it in 1928. [[Marist Saints|Marist Old Boys]] stuffed their trophy cabinet when they won the Roope Rooster (defeating [[City Rovers]] 28\u20138), Stormont Shield (defeating [[North Shore Albions|Devonport United]] 15\u20138), and Max Jaffe Cup for finishing runner up in the Senior Championship (they beat [[Ponsonby Ponies|Ponsonby United]] in a playoff after both teams tied for second by 37 to 8). [[City Rovers]] won the Thistle Cup after beating [[North Shore Albions|Devonport]] in the final by 22 to 19 after both teams finished with 8 competitions points in the second round thus forcing a playoff for the Cup. [[Richmond Bulldogs|Richmond]] won the Davis Shield after their lower grade teams combined for the most competition points in Auckland. This was remarkably their 10th win in the Shields 12 year history.\n\nIn the reserve grade [[Richmond Bulldogs|Richmond Reserves]] won with an 8 win, 2 loss record, with [[Ponsonby Ponies|Ponsonby Reserves]] finishing runner up. The [[Marist Saints|Marist Old Boys]] club added yet another trophy to their season haul with their reserve grade team winning the Stallard Cup (awarded to the reserve grade knockout winners) when they beat [[North Shore Albions|Devonport Reserves]] by 12\u20136 in the final.\n\nThe representative program was marked by a match between [[Auckland rugby league team|Auckland]] and the touring [[England national rugby league team|England team]]. In a very competitive match Auckland went down by 14 to 19. Aside from this fixture Auckland did not play any other full representative matches. An Auckland XIII played a match against [[Waikato rugby league team|South Auckland]] where they won 29 to 13, and a series of trial matches such as North Island v South Island and Probables v Possibles matches were played featuring many Auckland players.\n\n{{s-start}}\n    {{s-bef|before=[[1931 Auckland Rugby League season|1931]]}}\n    {{s-ttl|title=24th [[Auckland Rugby League]] season\n    |years=1932}}\n    {{s-aft|after=[[1933 Auckland Rugby League season|1933]]}}\n    {{end}}\n{{TOC right}}\n\n=== Annual General Meeting ===\nAt the annual general meeting of the [[Auckland Rugby League]] on 11 April [[Ted Phelan|Mr. E.J.
