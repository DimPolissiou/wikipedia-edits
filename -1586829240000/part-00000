The device features an [[Apple A4]] [[System on chip|SoC]], a 9.7\" touchscreen display, and, on certain variants, the capability of accessing cellular networks. Using the [[iOS]] operating system, the iPad can [[portable media player|play music]], send and receive email and [[web browser|browse the web]]. Other functions, which include the ability to play [[Video game|games]] and access [[reference work|references]], [[GPS navigation software|GPS navigation]] software and [[social network service]]s can be enabled by downloading [[application software|apps]].\n\nThe device was announced and unveiled on January 26, 2010 at a media conference. On April 3, 2010, the Wi-Fi variant of the device was released in the [[United States|USA]], followed by the release of the \"Wi-Fi + Cellular\" variant on April 30. On May 28, 2010, it was released in Australia, Canada, France, Japan, Italy, Germany, Spain, Switzerland and the UK.\n\nThe device received positive reviews from various technology blogs and publications. Reviewers praised the device for its wide range of capabilities and labelled it as a competitor to laptops and [[netbook]]s. Some aspects were criticized, including the closed nature of the operating system and the lack of support for the Adobe Flash multimedia format. During the first 80 days, 3 million iPads were sold. By the launch of the [[iPad 2]], Apple sold more than 15 million iPads.\n\nOn March 2, 2011, Apple announced the iPad 2 and reduced the price of the 1st-generation iPad.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/technology/apple/8357861/Apple-iPad-2-Steve-Jobs-makes-surprise-launch-appearance.html|title=Apple iPad 2: Steve Jobs makes surprise launch appearance|last=Barnett|first=Emma|date=2011-03-02|access-date=2018-11-07|language=en-GB|issn=0307-1235}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.macrumors.com/2011/03/02/first-generation-ipad-prices-reduced-by-100/|title=First-Generation iPad Prices Reduced by $100|access-date=2018-11-07|language=en}}</ref>\n\n==History==\nApple co-founder Steve Jobs stated in a 1983 speech about the company:<ref name=\"panzarino20121002\">{{cite web|url=https://thenextweb.com/apple/2012/10/02/rare-full-recording-of-1983-steve-jobs-speech-reveals-apple-had-been-working-on-ipad-for-27-years/ | title=Rare full recording of 1983 Steve Jobs speech reveals Apple had been working on iPad for 27 years | work=The Next Web | date=October 2, 2012 | accessdate=October 2, 2012 | author=Panzarino, Matthew}}</ref>\n\n{{quote|\"[Our] strategy is really simple.

[[tablet computer]] designed and marketed by [[Apple Inc.]] as the first in the [[iPad]] lineup. The device features an [[Apple A4]] [[SoC]], a 9.7\" touchscreen display, and, on certain variants, the capability of accessing cellular networks. Using the [[iOS]] operating system, the iPad can [[portable media player|play music]], send and receive email and [[web browser|browse the web]]. Other functions, which include the ability to play [[Video game|games]] and access [[reference work|references]], [[GPS navigation software|GPS navigation]] software and [[social network service]]s can be enabled by downloading [[application software|apps]].\n\nThe device was announced and unveiled on January 26, 2010 at a media conference. On April 3, 2010, the Wi-Fi variant of the device was released in the [[United States|USA]], followed by the release of the \"Wi-Fi + Cellular\" variant on April 30. On May 28, 2010, it was released in Australia, Canada, France, Japan, Italy, Germany, Spain, Switzerland and the UK.\n\nThe device received positive reviews from various technology blogs and publications. Reviewers praised the device for its wide range of capabilities and labelled it as a competitor to laptops and [[netbook]]s. Some aspects were criticized, including the closed nature of the operating system and the lack of support for the Adobe Flash multimedia format. During the first 80 days, 3 million iPads were sold. By the launch of the [[iPad 2]], Apple sold more than 15 million iPads.\n\nOn March 2, 2011, Apple announced the iPad 2 and reduced the price of the 1st-generation iPad.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/technology/apple/8357861/Apple-iPad-2-Steve-Jobs-makes-surprise-launch-appearance.html|title=Apple iPad 2: Steve Jobs makes surprise launch appearance|last=Barnett|first=Emma|date=2011-03-02|access-date=2018-11-07|language=en-GB|issn=0307-1235}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.macrumors.com/2011/03/02/first-generation-ipad-prices-reduced-by-100/|title=First-Generation iPad Prices Reduced by $100|access-date=2018-11-07|language=en}}</ref>\n\n==History==\nApple co-founder Steve Jobs stated in a 1983 speech about the company:<ref name=\"panzarino20121002\">{{cite web|url=https://thenextweb.com/apple/2012/10/02/rare-full-recording-of-1983-steve-jobs-speech-reveals-apple-had-been-working-on-ipad-for-27-years/ | title=Rare full recording of 1983 Steve Jobs speech reveals Apple had been working on iPad for 27 years | work=The Next Web | date=October 2, 2012 | accessdate=October 2, 2012 | author=Panzarino, Matthew}}</ref>\n\n{{quote|\"[Our] strategy is really simple.

The series consists of four [[short films]] and one [[feature-length film]], but has spawned numerous spin-offs and TV adaptations. The series centres on Wallace, a good-natured, eccentric, cheese-loving inventor, along with his companion Gromit, a silent yet loyal and intelligent [[anthropomorphism|anthropomorphic]] dog. The first short film, ''[[A Grand Day Out]]'', was finished and made public in 1989. Wallace was originally voiced by veteran actor [[Peter Sallis]] and later by [[Ben Whitehead]]. Gromit is largely silent, instead communicating only through means of [[facial expressions]] and [[body language]].<ref>Gromit occasionally makes dog-like noises, such as barks and yelps.{{cite web|url=http://www.siegler.net/gromit/|title=Gromit Speaks|publisher=|accessdate=6 October 2014}}</ref>\n\nBecause of their widespread popularity, the characters have been described as positive international [[List of cultural icons of the United Kingdom|cultural icons]] of both modern British culture and British people in general.

Retrieved 7 June 2009.</ref> Although not overtly set in any particular town, Nick Park has hinted that it was inspired by 1950s [[Wigan]] in the north of England. Wallace's accent (voiced by Peter Sallis) comes from the [[Holme Valley]] of [[West Yorkshire]]. Wallace is fond of [[Wensleydale cheese]] (from [[Wensleydale]], North Yorkshire).\n\nTheir films have received critical acclaim, with the first three of the short films, ''[[A Grand Day Out]]'' (1989), ''[[The Wrong Trousers]]'' (1993) and ''[[A Close Shave]]'' (1995), having [[List of films with a 100% rating on Rotten Tomatoes|100% positive ratings]] on the aggregation site [[Rotten Tomatoes]]; the feature film ''[[Wallace & Gromit: The Curse of the Were-Rabbit]]'' (2005) earned a 95% (and a 7.4/10 ''[[IMDb]]'' rating) rating. The feature film is the [[List of highest-grossing animated films#Stop motion animation|second highest-grossing stop motion animated film ever]], only outgrossed by ''[[Chicken Run]]'', another Nick Park creation.<ref>{{cite web|title=The Longer View: British animation|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/timelines/z9xvcwx|publisher=BBC|accessdate=9 October 2015}}</ref>\n\nThe Wallace and Gromit characters spearhead the fundraising for two children's charities: Wallace & Gromit's Children's Foundation, which supports [[children's hospice]]s and [[Children's hospital|hospitals]] in the United Kingdom, and Wallace and Gromit's Grand Appeal, the [[Bristol Royal Hospital for Children#Wallace & Gromit's Grand Appeal|charity for Bristol Children's Hospital]] in [[Bristol]], England.\n\n==History==\nThe first short film, ''[[A Grand Day Out]]'', was nominated for the [[Academy Award for Best Animated Short Film]] in 1990, but lost to ''[[Creature Comforts]]'', another animated creation of Nick Park. The short films ''[[The Wrong Trousers]]'' and ''[[A Close Shave]]'' followed. The full-length feature ''[[Wallace & Gromit: The Curse of the Were-Rabbit|The Curse of the Were-Rabbit]]'' was released in 2005. The latter three each earned Academy Awards.\n\nIn January 2007, a five-film deal with [[DreamWorks Pictures|DreamWorks]] and Aardman fell through after only three films, due to creative differences, as well as the box office failure of ''[[Flushed Away]]''. Park said later that DreamWorks executives wanted to [[Americanize|Americanise]] the very British Wallace and Gromit after test screenings, which would have tarnished some of the duo's [[nostalgic]] charm. The fourth Wallace & Gromit short, ''[[A Matter of Loaf and Death]],'' was [[Nick Park]]'s first production since the end of the DreamWorks deal. It was the most watched television programme in the UK in 2008.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/media/2008/dec/26/wallace-and-gromit-lead-bbc-to-christmas-ratings-victory|title=Wallace and Gromit lead BBC to Christmas ratings victory|work=The Guardian|accessdate=26 December 2008|location=London|first=James| last=Robinson|date=26 December 2008|archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20090106120125/http://www.guardian.co.uk/media/2008/dec/26/wallace-and-gromit-lead-bbc-to-christmas-ratings-victory| archivedate= 6 January 2009 | url-status= live}}</ref> ''A Matter of Loaf and Death'' won the 2008 [[BAFTA Award]] for Best Short Animation and was nominated for an Academy Award in 2010.<ref name=\"Film Winners in 2009\">{{cite web|url=http://www.bafta.org/awards/film/film-nominations-in-2009,657,BA.html|title=Film Winners in 2009|publisher=BAFTA|accessdate=8 February 2009|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090211183707/http://bafta.org/awards/film/film-nominations-in-2009,657,BA.html|archivedate=11 February 2009|url-status=dead}}</ref> In 2013, [[Peter Lord]] stated that there were no plans at the moment for a new short film, and Nick Park announced in the following year that the declining health of Wallace's voice actor, [[Peter Sallis]], had the possibility of preventing any future films despite the availability of Ben Whitehead.<ref name=\"Wallace and Gromit may possibly end due to Peter Sallis's health\">{{cite web|url=https://www.digitalspy.com/movies/news/a571482/wallace-and-gromit-may-end-due-to-peter-salliss-health.html#~oEyRyxHuo5pZ0o|title=Wallace and Gromit may end due to Peter Sallis's health|last=Eames|first=Tom|date=May 16, 2014|work=Digital Spy|accessdate=16 May 2014}}</ref>\nOn 4 May 2017, Peter Lord stated that more projects with the characters are likely while speaking at an animation event in [[Stuttgart]], Germany.

His surname is never given. He usually wears a white shirt, brown wool trousers, a green knitted [[Sleeveless sweater|pullover]], and a red tie. He is fond of cheese, especially [[Wensleydale cheese|Wensleydale]],<ref name=\"wensleydale\">{{cite news|url=http://www.wallaceandgromit.net/wensleydale.php|title=Not even Wensleydale?|last=|first=|date=|work=wallaceandgromit.net|accessdate=24 July 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181006041635/https://www.wallaceandgromit.net/wensleydale.php|archive-date=October 6, 2018}}</ref> and [[Cracker (food)|crackers]].\n\nNick Park, his creator, said: \"He's a very self-contained figure. A very homely sort who doesn't mind the odd adventure.\" He is loosely based on Nick Park's father,<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/talking_point/forum/2314009.stm |title=Talking Point &#124; Ask Wallace and Gromit creator: Nick Park |work=BBC News|date=15 October 2002 |accessdate=20 July 2009}}</ref> whom Park described in a radio interview as \"an incurable tinkerer\". He described one of his father's constructions, a combination beach hut and trailer, as having curtains in the windows, bookshelves on the walls, and full-sized furniture bolted to the floor. The way he dresses and his passion for cheese are based on an eccentric school teacher.{{Citation needed|date=January 2020}}\n\nWallace has been voiced by [[Peter Sallis]] (until 2010), and [[Ben Whitehead]] (in 2009 and since 2011) in ''[[Wallace & Gromit's Grand Adventures]]'' and ''[[Wallace & Gromit's Musical Marvels]]'' commercials and apps.<ref name=\"mixnmojo\" />\n\nWallace is an inveterate inventor, creating elaborate contraptions that often do not work as intended. Their appearance is similar to the illustrations of [[W. Heath Robinson]] and [[Rube Goldberg]], and Nick Park has said of Wallace that all his inventions are designed around the principle of using a \"sledgehammer to crack a nut.\"  Some of Wallace's contraptions are based on real-life inventions. For example, his method of waking up in the morning utilises a bed that tips over to wake up its owner, an invention that was exhibited at [[The Great Exhibition]] of 1851 by [[Theophilus Carter]].\n\nWallace's official job varies; in ''A Close Shave'' he is a window washer.  In ''The Curse of the Were-Rabbit,'' Wallace runs a humane pest control service, keeping the captured creatures (nearly all of which are rabbits) in the basement of his house. In the most recent short, ''A Matter of Loaf and Death'', he is a baker. While he has shown himself to be skilled to some degree in the businesses he creates, an unexpected flaw in the inventions he uses to assist him in his latest venture or simple bad luck often ends up being his downfall.\n\nIn the first photo shown on ''[[Wallace & Gromit: The Curse of the Were-Rabbit|The Curse of the Were-Rabbit]]'', it was revealed that Wallace once had a full head of hair and a very thick moustache with [[muttonchops]]. On the photo that shows Gromit's graduation at Dogwarts, he had lost his beard, but still had a little hair, in the form of side burns just above his ears. In ''[[The Wrong Trousers]]'', he still uses a hair-dryer. In ''A Matter of Loaf and Death'', when Wallace is talking to Gromit, a picture is seen behind Gromit of Wallace with a brown beard and brown hair.\n\nWallace has had three love interests. The first was Wendolene Ramsbottom,<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/character/ch0004598/|title=Wendolene Ramsbottom (Character)|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=IMDb|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160529081857/http://www.imdb.com/character/ch0004598/|archive-date=May 29, 2016|url-status=dead|accessdate=6 October 2014}}</ref> which ended quickly when Wendolene told Wallace that cheese gives her a rash. The second was [[Lady Tottington]] in ''The Curse of the Were-Rabbit'', whom Wallace fondly calls \"Totty\". In ''A Matter of Loaf and Death'', Wallace becomes engaged to Piella Bakewell,<ref>{{cite web |author=A Close Shave |url=http://www.wallaceandgromit.com/films/loafanddeath/characters.html |title=Characters |publisher=Wallace and Gromit |accessdate=20 July 2009 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090708152422/http://www.wallaceandgromit.com/films/loafanddeath/characters.html |archivedate=8 July 2009  }}</ref> but this ended when she turned out to be a murderess who hated bakers, and was eaten by crocodiles upon trying to escape justice.

His prized possessions include his alarm clock, dog bone, brush, and a framed photo of himself with Wallace. He is very handy with electronic equipment and an excellent aeroplane pilot. He often threatens the plans of the villains he and Wallace encounter in their adventures. Sometimes, Gromit ignores Wallace's orders, such as in ''A Close Shave'' and ''Shopper 13'', where Wallace orders him to get rid of Shaun, but Gromit does not. Gromit's birthday is 12 February.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://wallaceandgromit.com/news/20-things-you-might-not-know-about-gromit|title=20 Things You Might Not Know About Gromit|website=wallaceandgromit.com}}</ref> In ''[[The Wrong Trousers]]'', he is seen circling the date on a calendar.\n\nGromit has no visible mouth and expresses himself through facial expressions and body language. [[Peter Hawkins]] originally intended to voice Gromit, but Park dropped the idea when he realised how Gromit's thoughts and feelings could be known through movement with some canine noises on rare occasions.<ref>{{cite book |author=Andy Lane |title=The World of Wallace and Gromit |year=2004 |publisher=BoxTree |page=43 |isbn=9780752215587}}</ref><ref name=telegraph>{{cite news|author=Nigel Farndale|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/tvandradio/3831833/Wallace-and-Gromit-one-man-and-his-dog.html|title=Wallace and Gromit: one man and his dog|work=[[The Daily Telegraph]]|date=18 December 2008|accessdate=18 December 2008|location=London}}</ref> Many critics believe that Gromit's silence makes him the perfect [[double act|straight man]], with a [[pantomime]] expressiveness that drew favourable comparisons to [[Buster Keaton]].<ref>{{cite news|url=https://variety.com/2005/film/awards/wallace-gromit-the-curse-of-the-were-rabbit-1200523132/|title=Review: \u2018Wallace & Gromit: The Curse of the Were-Rabbit\u2019|work=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]|last=Felperin|first=Leslie|date=16 September 2005|accessdate=24 July 2017}}</ref> He does at times make dog-like noises, such as yelps and growling.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.siegler.net/gromit/|title=Gromit Speaks|accessdate=6 October 2014}}</ref> Nick Park says: \"We are a nation of dog-lovers and so many people have said: 'My dog looks at me just like Gromit does!'\"{{Citation needed|date=January 2020}}\n\nGenerally speaking Gromit's tastes are more in vogue than those of Wallace; this being one of the many ways they contrast with each other as characters. Gromit seems to have a significant interest in encyclopaedic, classical and philosophical literature, and popular culture, including film and music. ''Electronics for Dogs'' has been a firm favourite since ''[[A Grand Day Out]]'', and in ''[[The Wrong Trousers]]'' Gromit's bookshelves feature titles such as ''Kites'', ''Sticks'', ''Sheep'', ''Penguins'', ''Rockets'', ''Bones'', and ''Stars'', while he is seen reading ''The Republic'', by Pluto (a nod to the [[Pluto (Disney)|Disney character of the same name]] and a pun on [[Plato]]) and ''Crime and Punishment'', by Fido Dogstoyevsky (a pun on [[Fyodor Dostoyevsky]]).

In common with other animation techniques, the stop motion animation in Wallace and Gromit may duplicate frames if there is little motion, and in action scenes sometimes multiple exposures per frame are used to produce a faux [[motion blur]]. Because a second of film constitutes 24 separate frames, even a short half-hour film like ''A Close Shave'' takes a great deal of time to animate. General quotes on the speed of animation of a Wallace and Gromit film put the filming rate at typically around 30 frames per day per animator. The feature-length ''The Curse of the Were-Rabbit'' took 15 months to make.\n\nSome effects, particularly the fire, smoke, and floating bunnies in ''The Curse of the Were-Rabbit'', proved impossible to create in stop motion and were rendered by [[computer animation]] specialists, MPC film.<ref name=\":0\">{{cite web|url=http://www.moving-picture.com/film/filmography/wallace-and-gromit-the-curse-of-the-warerabbit|title=Wallace and Gromit: The Curse of the Ware-rabbit|last=Anon|work=MPC official website|publisher=MPC|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150725235804/http://www.moving-picture.com/film/filmography/wallace-and-gromit-the-curse-of-the-warerabbit|archivedate=25 July 2015|accessdate=25 July 2015}}</ref> MPC film studied the set for three months in order to create clay-like animation to match the stop-motion production. By paying close attention to detail, MPC was able to make the animated bunnies blend in with the clay bunnies. Adding imperfections such as fingerprints along with texture to the animated bunnies helped enhance the effect. MPC's collaboration resulted in over 700 effects to aid the film along with colouring to match the visuals.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nMost models were destroyed in the [[Aardman Animations#History|2005 Aardman studio fire]], but a set from ''A Matter of Loaf and Death'' is presently on display at the [[At-Bristol]] science centre.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.at-bristol.org.uk/animateit.html|title=At-Bristol Animate It|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091021090120/http://www.at-bristol.org.uk/animateit.html|archive-date=2009-10-21}}</ref> The set and several props from the museum featured in ''The Wrong Trousers'' survived as well, as they were being kept at the [[National Science and Media Museum]] in [[Bradford, West Yorkshire]] before the fire occurred.\n\n===Music===\nThe music featured in every film was written by British film composer [[Julian Nott]].

The series consists of four [[short films]] and one [[feature-length film]], but has spawned numerous spin-offs and TV adaptations. The series centres on Wallace, a good-natured, eccentric, cheese-loving inventor, along with his companion Gromit, a silent yet loyal and intelligent [[anthropomorphism|anthropomorphic]] dog. The first short film, ''[[A Grand Day Out]]'', was finished and made public in 1989. Wallace was originally voiced by veteran actor [[Peter Sallis]] and later by [[Ben Whitehead]]. Gromit is largely silent, instead communicating only through means of [[facial expressions]] and [[body language]].<ref>Gromit occasionally makes dog-like noises, such as barks and yelps.{{cite web|url=http://www.siegler.net/gromit/|title=Gromit Speaks|publisher=|accessdate=6 October 2014}}</ref>\n\nBecause of their widespread popularity, the characters have been described as positive international [[List of cultural icons of the United Kingdom|cultural icons]] of both modern British culture and British people in general.

Retrieved 7 June 2009.</ref> Although not overtly set in any particular town, Nick Park has hinted that it was inspired by 1950s [[Wigan]] in the north of England. Wallace's accent (voiced by Peter Sallis) comes from the [[Holme Valley]] of [[West Yorkshire]]. Wallace is fond of [[Wensleydale cheese]] (from [[Wensleydale]], North Yorkshire).\n\nTheir films have received critical acclaim, with the first three of the short films, ''[[A Grand Day Out]]'' (1989), ''[[The Wrong Trousers]]'' (1993) and ''[[A Close Shave]]'' (1995), having [[List of films with a 100% rating on Rotten Tomatoes|100% positive ratings]] on the aggregation site [[Rotten Tomatoes]]; the feature film ''[[Wallace & Gromit: The Curse of the Were-Rabbit]]'' (2005) earned a 95% (and a 7.4/10 ''[[IMDb]]'' rating) rating. The feature film is the [[List of highest-grossing animated films#Stop motion animation|second highest-grossing stop motion animated film ever]], only outgrossed by ''[[Chicken Run]]'', another Nick Park creation.<ref>{{cite web|title=The Longer View: British animation|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/timelines/z9xvcwx|publisher=BBC|accessdate=9 October 2015}}</ref>\n\nThe Wallace and Gromit characters spearhead the fundraising for two children's charities: Wallace & Gromit's Children's Foundation, which supports [[children's hospice]]s and [[Children's hospital|hospitals]] in the United Kingdom, and Wallace and Gromit's Grand Appeal, the [[Bristol Royal Hospital for Children#Wallace & Gromit's Grand Appeal|charity for Bristol Children's Hospital]] in [[Bristol]], England.\n\n==History==\nThe first short film, ''[[A Grand Day Out]]'', was nominated for the [[Academy Award for Best Animated Short Film]] in 1990, but lost to ''[[Creature Comforts]]'', another animated creation of Nick Park. The short films ''[[The Wrong Trousers]]'' and ''[[A Close Shave]]'' followed. The full-length feature ''[[Wallace & Gromit: The Curse of the Were-Rabbit|The Curse of the Were-Rabbit]]'' was released in 2005. The latter three each earned Academy Awards.\n\nIn January 2007, a five-film deal with [[DreamWorks Pictures|DreamWorks]] and Aardman fell through after only three films, due to creative differences, as well as the box office failure of ''[[Flushed Away]]''. Park said later that DreamWorks executives wanted to [[Americanize|Americanise]] the very British Wallace and Gromit after test screenings, which would have tarnished some of the duo's [[nostalgic]] charm. The fourth Wallace & Gromit short, ''[[A Matter of Loaf and Death]],'' was [[Nick Park]]'s first production since the end of the DreamWorks deal. It was the most watched television programme in the UK in 2008.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/media/2008/dec/26/wallace-and-gromit-lead-bbc-to-christmas-ratings-victory|title=Wallace and Gromit lead BBC to Christmas ratings victory|work=The Guardian|accessdate=26 December 2008|location=London|first=James| last=Robinson|date=26 December 2008|archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20090106120125/http://www.guardian.co.uk/media/2008/dec/26/wallace-and-gromit-lead-bbc-to-christmas-ratings-victory| archivedate= 6 January 2009 | url-status= live}}</ref> ''A Matter of Loaf and Death'' won the 2008 [[BAFTA Award]] for Best Short Animation and was nominated for an Academy Award in 2010.<ref name=\"Film Winners in 2009\">{{cite web|url=http://www.bafta.org/awards/film/film-nominations-in-2009,657,BA.html|title=Film Winners in 2009|publisher=BAFTA|accessdate=8 February 2009|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090211183707/http://bafta.org/awards/film/film-nominations-in-2009,657,BA.html|archivedate=11 February 2009|url-status=dead}}</ref> In 2013, [[Peter Lord]] stated that there were no plans at the moment for a new short film, and Nick Park announced in the following year that the declining health of Wallace's voice actor, [[Peter Sallis]], had the possibility of preventing any future films despite the availability of Ben Whitehead.<ref name=\"Wallace and Gromit may possibly end due to Peter Sallis's health\">{{cite web|url=https://www.digitalspy.com/movies/news/a571482/wallace-and-gromit-may-end-due-to-peter-salliss-health.html#~oEyRyxHuo5pZ0o|title=Wallace and Gromit may end due to Peter Sallis's health|last=Eames|first=Tom|date=May 16, 2014|work=Digital Spy|accessdate=16 May 2014}}</ref>\nOn 4 May 2017, Peter Lord stated that more projects with the characters are likely while speaking at an animation event in [[Stuttgart]], Germany.

His surname is never given. He usually wears a white shirt, brown wool trousers, a green knitted [[Sleeveless sweater|pullover]], and a red tie. He is fond of cheese, especially [[Wensleydale cheese|Wensleydale]],<ref name=\"wensleydale\">{{cite news|url=http://www.wallaceandgromit.net/wensleydale.php|title=Not even Wensleydale?|last=|first=|date=|work=wallaceandgromit.net|accessdate=24 July 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181006041635/https://www.wallaceandgromit.net/wensleydale.php|archive-date=October 6, 2018}}</ref> and [[Cracker (food)|crackers]].\n\nNick Park, his creator, said: \"He's a very self-contained figure. A very homely sort who doesn't mind the odd adventure.\" He is loosely based on Nick Park's father,<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/talking_point/forum/2314009.stm |title=Talking Point &#124; Ask Wallace and Gromit creator: Nick Park |work=BBC News|date=15 October 2002 |accessdate=20 July 2009}}</ref> whom Park described in a radio interview as \"an incurable tinkerer\". He described one of his father's constructions, a combination beach hut and trailer, as having curtains in the windows, bookshelves on the walls, and full-sized furniture bolted to the floor. The way he dresses and his passion for cheese are based on an eccentric school teacher.{{Citation needed|date=January 2020}}\n\nWallace has been voiced by [[Peter Sallis]] (until 2010), and [[Ben Whitehead]] (in 2009 and since 2011) in ''[[Wallace & Gromit's Grand Adventures]]'' and ''[[Wallace & Gromit's Musical Marvels]]'' commercials and apps.<ref name=\"mixnmojo\" />\n\nWallace is an inveterate inventor, creating elaborate contraptions that often do not work as intended. Their appearance is similar to the illustrations of [[W. Heath Robinson]] and [[Rube Goldberg]], and Nick Park has said of Wallace that all his inventions are designed around the principle of using a \"sledgehammer to crack a nut.\"  Some of Wallace's contraptions are based on real-life inventions. For example, his method of waking up in the morning utilises a bed that tips over to wake up its owner, an invention that was exhibited at [[The Great Exhibition]] of 1851 by [[Theophilus Carter]].\n\nWallace's official job varies; in ''A Close Shave'' he is a window washer.  In ''The Curse of the Were-Rabbit,'' Wallace runs a humane pest control service, keeping the captured creatures (nearly all of which are rabbits) in the basement of his house. In the most recent short, ''A Matter of Loaf and Death'', he is a baker. While he has shown himself to be skilled to some degree in the businesses he creates, an unexpected flaw in the inventions he uses to assist him in his latest venture or simple bad luck often ends up being his downfall.\n\nIn the first photo shown on ''[[Wallace & Gromit: The Curse of the Were-Rabbit|The Curse of the Were-Rabbit]]'', it was revealed that Wallace once had a full head of hair and a very thick moustache with [[muttonchops]]. On the photo that shows Gromit's graduation at Dogwarts, he had lost his beard, but still had a little hair, in the form of side burns just above his ears. In ''[[The Wrong Trousers]]'', he still uses a hair-dryer. In ''A Matter of Loaf and Death'', when Wallace is talking to Gromit, a picture is seen behind Gromit of Wallace with a brown beard and brown hair.\n\nWallace has had three love interests. The first was Wendolene Ramsbottom,<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/character/ch0004598/|title=Wendolene Ramsbottom (Character)|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=IMDb|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160529081857/http://www.imdb.com/character/ch0004598/|archive-date=May 29, 2016|url-status=dead|accessdate=6 October 2014}}</ref> which ended quickly when Wendolene told Wallace that cheese gives her a rash. The second was [[Lady Tottington]] in ''The Curse of the Were-Rabbit'', whom Wallace fondly calls \"Totty\". In ''A Matter of Loaf and Death'', Wallace becomes engaged to Piella Bakewell,<ref>{{cite web |author=A Close Shave |url=http://www.wallaceandgromit.com/films/loafanddeath/characters.html |title=Characters |publisher=Wallace and Gromit |accessdate=20 July 2009 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090708152422/http://www.wallaceandgromit.com/films/loafanddeath/characters.html |archivedate=8 July 2009  }}</ref> but this ended when she turned out to be a murderess who hated bakers, and was eaten by crocodiles upon trying to escape justice.

His prized possessions include his alarm clock, dog bone, brush, and a framed photo of himself with Wallace. He is very handy with electronic equipment and an excellent aeroplane pilot. He often threatens the plans of the villains he and Wallace encounter in their adventures. Sometimes, Gromit ignores Wallace's orders, such as in ''A Close Shave'' and ''Shopper 13'', where Wallace orders him to get rid of Shaun, but Gromit does not. Gromit's birthday is 12 February.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://wallaceandgromit.com/news/20-things-you-might-not-know-about-gromit|title=20 Things You Might Not Know About Gromit|website=wallaceandgromit.com}}</ref> In ''[[The Wrong Trousers]]'', he is seen circling the date on a calendar.\n\nGromit has no visible mouth and expresses himself through facial expressions and body language. [[Peter Hawkins]] originally intended to voice Gromit, but Park dropped the idea when he realised how Gromit's thoughts and feelings could be known through movement with some canine noises on rare occasions.<ref>{{cite book |author=Andy Lane |title=The World of Wallace and Gromit |year=2004 |publisher=BoxTree |page=43 |isbn=9780752215587}}</ref><ref name=telegraph>{{cite news|author=Nigel Farndale|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/tvandradio/3831833/Wallace-and-Gromit-one-man-and-his-dog.html|title=Wallace and Gromit: one man and his dog|work=[[The Daily Telegraph]]|date=18 December 2008|accessdate=18 December 2008|location=London}}</ref> Many critics believe that Gromit's silence makes him the perfect [[double act|straight man]], with a [[pantomime]] expressiveness that drew favourable comparisons to [[Buster Keaton]].<ref>{{cite news|url=https://variety.com/2005/film/awards/wallace-gromit-the-curse-of-the-were-rabbit-1200523132/|title=Review: \u2018Wallace & Gromit: The Curse of the Were-Rabbit\u2019|work=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]|last=Felperin|first=Leslie|date=16 September 2005|accessdate=24 July 2017}}</ref> He does at times make dog-like noises, such as yelps and growling.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.siegler.net/gromit/|title=Gromit Speaks|accessdate=6 October 2014}}</ref> Nick Park says: \"We are a nation of dog-lovers and so many people have said: 'My dog looks at me just like Gromit does!'\"{{Citation needed|date=January 2020}}\n\nGenerally speaking Gromit's tastes are more in vogue than those of Wallace; this being one of the many ways they contrast with each other as characters. Gromit seems to have a significant interest in encyclopaedic, classical and philosophical literature, and popular culture, including film and music. ''Electronics for Dogs'' has been a firm favourite since ''[[A Grand Day Out]]'', and in ''[[The Wrong Trousers]]'' Gromit's bookshelves feature titles such as ''Kites'', ''Sticks'', ''Sheep'', ''Penguins'', ''Rockets'', ''Bones'', and ''Stars'', while he is seen reading ''The Republic'', by Pluto (a nod to the [[Pluto (Disney)|Disney character of the same name]] and a pun on [[Plato]]) and ''Crime and Punishment'', by Fido Dogstoyevsky (a pun on [[Fyodor Dostoyevsky]]).

In common with other animation techniques, the stop motion animation in Wallace and Gromit may duplicate frames if there is little motion, and in action scenes sometimes multiple exposures per frame are used to produce a faux [[motion blur]]. Because a second of film constitutes 24 separate frames, even a short half-hour film like ''A Close Shave'' takes a great deal of time to animate. General quotes on the speed of animation of a Wallace and Gromit film put the filming rate at typically around 30 frames per day per animator. The feature-length ''The Curse of the Were-Rabbit'' took 15 months to make.\n\nSome effects, particularly the fire, smoke, and floating bunnies in ''The Curse of the Were-Rabbit'', proved impossible to create in stop motion and were rendered by [[computer animation]] specialists, MPC film.<ref name=\":0\">{{cite web|url=http://www.moving-picture.com/film/filmography/wallace-and-gromit-the-curse-of-the-warerabbit|title=Wallace and Gromit: The Curse of the Ware-rabbit|last=Anon|work=MPC official website|publisher=MPC|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150725235804/http://www.moving-picture.com/film/filmography/wallace-and-gromit-the-curse-of-the-warerabbit|archivedate=25 July 2015|accessdate=25 July 2015}}</ref> MPC film studied the set for three months in order to create clay-like animation to match the stop-motion production. By paying close attention to detail, MPC was able to make the animated bunnies blend in with the clay bunnies. Adding imperfections such as fingerprints along with texture to the animated bunnies helped enhance the effect. MPC's collaboration resulted in over 700 effects to aid the film along with colouring to match the visuals.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nMost models were destroyed in the [[Aardman Animations#History|2005 Aardman studio fire]], but a set from ''A Matter of Loaf and Death'' is presently on display at the [[At-Bristol]] science centre.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.at-bristol.org.uk/animateit.html|title=At-Bristol Animate It|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091021090120/http://www.at-bristol.org.uk/animateit.html|archive-date=2009-10-21}}</ref> The set and several props from the museum featured in ''The Wrong Trousers'' survived as well, as they were being kept at the [[National Science and Media Museum]] in [[Bradford, West Yorkshire]] before the fire occurred.\n\n===Music===\nThe music featured in every film was written by British film composer [[Julian Nott]].

Together these two actions accounted for nine tenths of the death sentences and three fourths of Gulag sentences. Out of the operations against national minorities, the [[Polish Operation of the NKVD]] was the largest one, second only to the \"Kulak Operation\" in terms of number of victims.

Historians debate the causes of the purge, such as Stalin's paranoia, or his desire to remove dissenters from the [[Communist Party of the Soviet Union|Communist Party]] or to consolidate his authority.  The purges began in the Red Army, and the techniques developed there were quickly adapted to purges in other sectors.<ref>Peter Whitewood,  \"The Purge of the Red Army and the Soviet Mass Operations, 1937\u201338.\" ''Slavonic & East European Review'' 93.2 (2015): 286-314. [http://ray.yorksj.ac.uk/id/eprint/958/1/slaveasteurorev2.93.2.0286.pdf online]</ref>  Most public attention was focused on the [[purge (communist)|purge]] of certain parts of the leadership of the Communist Party, as well as of government bureaucrats and leaders of the armed forces, most of whom were Party members. The campaigns also affected many other categories of the society: intelligentsia, peasants and especially those branded as \"too rich for a peasant\" ([[kulak]]s), and professionals.{{sfn|Conquest|2008|pp=250,&nbsp;257\u20138}} A series of NKVD operations affected a number of national minorities, accused of being \"[[fifth column]]\" communities. A number of purges were officially explained as an elimination of the possibilities of sabotage and espionage, by the [[Polish Military Organisation]] and, consequently, many victims of the purge were ordinary [[Poles in the former Soviet Union|Soviet citizens of Polish origin]].\n\nAccording to [[Nikita Khrushchev]]'s 1956 speech, \"[[On the Cult of Personality and Its Consequences]]\", and historian Robert Conquest, a great number of accusations, notably those presented at the [[Moscow Trials|Moscow show trial]]s, were based on [[forced confession]]s, often obtained through [[torture]],{{sfn|Conquest|2008|p=121 which cites his secret speech}} and on loose interpretations of [[Article 58 (RSFSR Penal Code)|Article 58 of the RSFSR Penal Code]], which dealt with counter-revolutionary crimes. Due legal process, as defined by Soviet law in force at the time, was often largely replaced with summary proceedings by [[NKVD troika]]s.{{sfn|Conquest|2008|p=286}}\n\nHundreds of thousands of victims were accused of various political crimes (espionage, [[Wrecking (Soviet crime)|wrecking]], [[sabotage]], [[anti-Soviet agitation]], conspiracies to prepare uprisings and coups); they were quickly executed by shooting, or sent to the [[Gulag]] [[labor camp]]s. Many died at the penal labor camps of starvation, disease, exposure, and overwork. Other methods of dispatching victims were used on an experimental basis. In Moscow, the use of [[Soviet gas van|gas van]]s used to kill the victims during their transportation to the [[Butovo firing range|Butovo firing range was documented]].<ref group=note>This information was published first in 1990 in a [[Komsomolskaya Pravda]] article (October 28, 1990, p. 2).

The campaigns were carried out according to the [[general line (party)|general line]], often by direct orders of the [[Politburo of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union|Party Politburo]] headed by Stalin.\n\n==Background==\n{{see also|Purges of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union}}\nFrom 1930 onwards, the Party and police officials feared the \"social disorder\" caused by the upheavals of [[Collectivization in the Soviet Union|forced collectivization of peasants]] and the resulting [[Soviet famine of 1932\u20131933|famine of 1932\u20131933]], as well as the massive and uncontrolled migration of millions of peasants into cities. The threat of war heightened Stalin's perception of marginal and politically suspect populations as the potential source of an uprising in case of invasion. He began to plan for the preventive elimination of such potential recruits for a mythical \"fifth column of wreckers, terrorists and spies.\" (Hagenloh, 2000; Shearer, 2003).<ref name=werth/>\n\n[[Image:Bundesarchiv Bild 183-R15068, Leo Dawidowitsch Trotzki.jpg|thumb|upright|left|[[Leon Trotsky]], in 1929, shortly before being driven out of the Soviet Union.]]\nThe term \"[[purge]]\" in Soviet political slang was an abbreviation of the expression ''purge of the Party ranks''. In 1933, for example, the Party expelled some 400,000 people. But from 1936 until 1953, the term changed its meaning, because being expelled from the Party came to mean almost certain arrest, imprisonment, and often execution.\n\nThe political purge was primarily an effort by Stalin to eliminate challenge from past and potential opposition groups, including the left and right wings led by [[Leon Trotsky]] and [[Nikolai Bukharin]], respectively. Following the [[Russian Civil War|Civil War]] and reconstruction of the Soviet economy in the late 1920s, veteran Bolsheviks no longer thought necessary the \"temporary\" wartime dictatorship, which had passed from Lenin to Stalin. Stalin's opponents on both sides of the political spectrum chided him as undemocratic and lax on bureaucratic corruption. This opposition to current leadership may have accumulated substantial support among the working class by attacking the privileges and luxuries the state offered to its high-paid elite. The [[Ryutin Affair]] seemed to vindicate Stalin's suspicions. He enforced a ban on party factions and banned those party members who had opposed him, effectively ending [[democratic centralism]].\n\nIn the new form of Party organization, the Politburo, and Stalin in particular, were the sole dispensers of ideology. This required the elimination of all Marxists with different views, especially those among the prestigious \"old guard\" of revolutionaries. As the purges began, the government (through the NKVD) shot Bolshevik heroes, including [[Mikhail Tukhachevsky]] and [[B\u00e9la Kun]], as well as the majority of Lenin's Politburo, for disagreements in policy. The NKVD attacked the supporters, friends, and family of these \"heretical\" Marxists, whether they lived in Russia or not. The NKVD nearly annihilated Trotsky's family before [[Leon Trotsky#Assassination|killing]] him in Mexico; the NKVD agent [[Ram\u00f3n Mercader]] was part of an assassination task force put together by Special Agent [[Pavel Sudoplatov]], under the personal orders of Stalin.{{sfn|Andrew|Mitrokhin|2000|pp=86\u20137}}\n\n[[Image:Sergei Kirov and Joseph Stalin, 1934.jpg|thumb|[[Saint Petersburg|Leningrad]] party leader [[Sergey Kirov|Sergei Kirov]] with [[Joseph Stalin|Stalin]] (and his daughter [[Svetlana Alliluyeva|Svetlana]]) in 1934.]]\nIn 1934, Stalin used the murder of [[Sergey Kirov]] as a pretext to launch the Great Purge, in which about a million people perished (see {{section link||Number of people executed}}). Some later historians came to believe that Stalin arranged the murder, or at least that there was sufficient evidence to reach such a conclusion.{{sfn|Conquest|1987|pp=122\u201338}} Kirov was a staunch Stalin loyalist, but Stalin may have viewed him as a potential rival because of his emerging popularity among the moderates. The [[17th Congress of the All-Union Communist Party (Bolsheviks)|1934 Party Congress]] elected Kirov to the central committee with only three votes against, the fewest of any candidate, while Stalin received 292 votes against. After Kirov's assassination, the NKVD charged the former oppositionists, an ever-growing group according to their determination, with Kirov's murder as well as a growing list of other offences, including treason, terrorism, sabotage, and espionage.\n\nAnother justification for the purge was to remove any possible \"fifth column\" in case of a war. [[Vyacheslav Molotov]] and [[Lazar Kaganovich]], participants in the repression as members of the Politburo, maintained this justification throughout the purge; they each signed many death lists.{{sfn|Figes|2007|p=239}} Stalin believed war was imminent, threatened both by an explicitly hostile Germany and an expansionist Japan.

These trials were highly publicized and extensively covered by the outside world, which was mesmerized by the spectacle of Lenin's closest associates confessing to most outrageous crimes and begging for death sentences.\n\n*The first trial was of 16 members of the so-called \"Trotskyite-Kamenevite-Zinovievite-Leftist-Counter-Revolutionary Bloc\",{{citation needed|date=January 2012}} held in August 1936,<ref>Rogovin (1998), pp. 17\u201318</ref> at which the chief defendants were [[Grigory Zinoviev]] and [[Lev Kamenev]], two of the most prominent former party leaders. Among other accusations, they were incriminated with the assassination of Kirov and plotting to kill Stalin.{{citation needed|date=January 2012}} After confessing to the charges, all were sentenced to death and executed.<ref name=\":0\">Rogovin (1998), pp. 36\u201338</ref>\n*The second trial in January 1937 involved 17 lesser figures known as the \"anti-Soviet Trotskyite-centre\" which included [[Karl Radek]], [[Yuri Piatakov]] and [[Grigory Sokolnikov]], and were accused of plotting with Trotsky, who was said to be conspiring with Germany. Thirteen of the defendants were eventually executed by shooting. The rest received sentences in labor camps where they soon died.\n*There was also a secret trial before a military tribunal of a group of Red Army commanders, including Mikhail Tukhachevsky, in June 1937.\n\n[[File:Radek's action.jpg|thumb|Prosecutor General [[Andrey Vyshinsky]] (centre), reading the 1937 indictment against [[Karl Radek]] during the 2nd [[Moscow Trials|Moscow Trial]]]]\nSome Western observers who attended the trials said that they were fair and that the guilt of the accused had been established. They based this assessment on the confessions of the accused, which were freely given in open court, without any apparent evidence that they had been extracted by torture or drugging. The British lawyer and Member of Parliament [[D.N. Pritt]], for example, wrote: \"Once again the more faint-hearted socialists are beset with doubts and anxieties\", but \"once again we can feel confident that when the smoke has rolled away from the battlefield of controversy it will be realized that the charge was true, the confessions correct and the prosecution fairly conducted\".\n\nIt is now known that the confessions were given only after great psychological pressure and torture had been applied to the defendants. From the accounts of former [[OGPU]] officer [[Alexander Mikhailovich Orlov|Alexander Orlov]] and others, the methods used to extract the confessions are known: such tortures as repeated beatings, simulated drownings, making prisoners stand or go without sleep for days on end, and threats to arrest and execute the prisoners' families. For example, Kamenev's teenage son was arrested and charged with terrorism. After months of such interrogation, the defendants were driven to despair and exhaustion.\n\nZinoviev and Kamenev demanded, as a condition for \"confessing\", a direct guarantee from the Politburo that their lives and that of their families and followers would be spared. This offer was accepted, but when they were taken to the alleged Politburo meeting, only Stalin, [[Kliment Voroshilov]], and Yezhov were present. Stalin claimed that they were the \"commission\" authorized by the Politburo and gave assurances that death sentences would not be carried out. After the trial, Stalin not only broke his promise to spare the defendants, he had most of their relatives arrested and shot.{{sfn|Conquest|2008|p=87}}\n\n====Dewey Commission====\n[[File:Vassily Blokhin.jpg|thumb|right|180px|The chief executioner of the NKVD, [[Vasili Blokhin]], carried out some of the high-profile executions during the purges.<ref>[[Timothy Snyder|Snyder, Timothy]].

The commission was headed by the noted American philosopher and educator [[John Dewey]]. Although the hearings were obviously conducted with a view to proving Trotsky's innocence, they brought to light evidence which established that some of the specific charges made at the trials could not be true.{{sfn|Snyder|2010|p=137}}\n\nFor example, [[Georgy Pyatakov]] testified that he had flown to [[Oslo]] in December 1935 to \"receive terrorist instructions\" from Trotsky. The Dewey Commission established that no such flight had taken place.<ref>{{Cite book|url=|title=Not guilty : report of the Commission of Inquiry Into the Charges Made Against Leon Trotsky in the Moscow Trials|last=Dewey|first=John|publisher=Sam Sloan and Ishi Press International|others=1859-1952|year=2008|isbn=978-0923891312|location=New York|pages=154\u2013155|oclc=843206645}}</ref> Another defendant, [[Ivan N. Smirnov|Ivan Smirnov]], confessed to taking part in the assassination of Sergei Kirov in December 1934, at a time when he had already been in prison for a year.\n\nThe Dewey Commission later published its findings in a 422-page book titled ''Not Guilty''. Its conclusions asserted the innocence of all those condemned in the Moscow Trials. In its summary, the commission wrote:\n{{quote|Independent of extrinsic evidence, the Commission finds:\n*That the conduct of the Moscow Trials was such as to convince any unprejudiced person that no attempt was made to ascertain the truth.\n*That while confessions are necessarily entitled to the most serious consideration, the confessions themselves contain such inherent improbabilities as to convince the Commission that they do not represent the truth, irrespective of any means used to obtain them.\n*That Trotsky never instructed any of the accused or witnesses in the Moscow trials to enter into agreements with foreign powers against the Soviet Union [and] that Trotsky never recommended, plotted, or attempted the restoration of capitalism in the USSR.}}\n\nThe commission concluded: \"We therefore find the Moscow Trials to be frame-ups.\"\n\n====Implication of the Rightists====\nIn the second trial, Karl Radek testified that there was a \"third organization separate from the cadres which had passed through [Trotsky's] school\"<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">British Embassy Report: Viscount Chilston to Mr. Eden, 6 February 1937</ref> as well as \"semi-Trotskyites, quarter-Trotskyites, one-eighth-Trotskyites, people who helped us, not knowing of the terrorist organization but sympathizing with us, people who from liberalism, from a Fronde against the Party, gave us this help.\"{{sfn|Conquest|2008|p=164}}\n\nBy the \"third organization\", he meant the last remaining former opposition group called the [[Right Opposition|Rightists]], led by Bukharin, whom he implicated by saying:\n\n{{quote|I feel guilty of one thing more: even after admitting my guilt and exposing the organisation, I stubbornly refused to give evidence about Bukharin. I knew that Bukharin's situation was just as hopeless as my own, because our guilt, if not juridically, then in essence, was the same. But we are close friends, and intellectual friendship is stronger than other friendships. I knew that Bukharin was in the same state of upheaval as myself. That is why I did not want to deliver him bound hand and foot to the People's Commissariat of Home Affairs. Just as in relation to our other cadres, I wanted Bukharin himself to lay down his arms.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/>}}\n\n===Third Moscow Trial===\n[[File:1934 agranov yagoda unknown redens.jpg|thumb|NKVD chiefs responsible for conducting mass repressions:  From l. to r.: [[Yakov Agranov]]; [[Genrikh Yagoda]]; unknown; [[Stanislav Redens]]. All three were themselves eventually arrested and executed.]]\nThe third and final trial, in March 1938, known as [[The Trial of the Twenty-One]], is the most famous of the Soviet show trials, because of persons involved and the scope of charges which tied together all loose threads from earlier trials. Meant to be the culmination of previous trials, it included 21 defendants alleged to belong to the so-called \"Bloc of Rightists and Trotskyites\", led by Nikolai Bukharin, the former chairman of the [[Communist International]], former premier [[Alexei Rykov]], [[Christian Rakovsky]], [[Nikolai Krestinsky]] and [[Genrikh Yagoda]], recently disgraced head of the NKVD.\n\nThe fact that Yagoda was one of the accused showed the speed at which the purges were consuming their own. It was now alleged that Bukharin and others sought to assassinate Lenin and Stalin from 1918, murder [[Maxim Gorky]] by poison, partition the U.S.S.R and hand her territories to Germany, Japan, and Great Britain, and other preposterous charges.\n\nEven previously sympathetic observers who had stomached the earlier trials found it harder to swallow these new allegations as they became ever more absurd, and the purge expanded to include almost every living Old Bolshevik leader except Stalin. No other crime of the Stalin years so captivated Western intellectuals as the trial and execution of Bukharin, who was a Marxist theorist of international standing.<ref name=\"Corey Robin, Fear, Page 96\">Corey Robin, \"Fear\", Page 96</ref> For some prominent communists such as [[Bertram Wolfe]], [[Jay Lovestone]], [[Arthur Koestler]], and [[Heinrich Brandler]], the Bukharin trial marked their final break with communism, and even turned the first three into fervent anti-Communists eventually.<ref>Bertram David Wolfe, \"Breaking with communism\", p. 10</ref>{{sfn|Koestler|1940|p=258}} To them, Bukharin's confession symbolized the\ndepredations of communism, which not only destroyed its sons but also conscripted them in self-destruction and individual abnegation.<ref name=\"Corey Robin, Fear, Page 96\"/>\n\nThe preparation for this trial, which took over a year, was delayed in its early stages due to the reluctance of some party members to denounce their comrades. It was at this time that Stalin personally intervened to speed up the process and replaced Yagoda with Yezhov.\n\n====Bukharin's confession====\n[[File:Bucharin.bra.jpg|thumb|170px|[[Nikolai Bukharin]], Russian [[Bolshevik]] [[Russian Revolution|revolutionary]] executed in 1938]]\nOn the first day of trial, Krestinsky caused a sensation when he repudiated his written confession and pleaded not guilty to all the charges. However, he changed his plea the next day after \"special measures\", which dislocated his left shoulder among other things.{{sfn|Conquest|2008|p=352}}\n\n[[Anastas Mikoyan]] and Vyacheslav Molotov later claimed that Bukharin was never tortured, but it is now known that his interrogators were given the order \"beating permitted\", and were under great pressure to extract confession out of the \"star\" defendant. Bukharin initially held out for three months, but threats to his young wife and infant son, combined with \"methods of physical influence\" wore him down. But when he read his confession amended and corrected personally by Stalin, he withdrew his whole confession. The examination started all over again, with a double team of interrogators.{{sfn|Conquest|2008|p=364\u20135}}\n\nBukharin's confession in particular became subject of much debate among Western observers, inspiring Koestler's acclaimed novel ''[[Darkness at Noon]]'' and philosophical essay by [[Maurice Merleau-Ponty]] in ''Humanism and Terror''. His confessions were somewhat different from others in that while he pleaded guilty to \"sum total of crimes\", he denied knowledge when it came to specific crimes. Some astute observers noted that he would allow only what was in written confession and refuse to go any further.\n\nThe result was a curious mix of fulsome confessions (of being a \"degenerate fascist\" working for \"restoration of capitalism\") and subtle criticisms of the trial. After disproving several charges against him, one observer noted that Bukharin \"proceeded to demolish or rather showed he could very easily demolish the whole case\".<ref>Report by Viscount Chilston (British ambassador) to Viscount Halifax, No.141, Moscow, 21 March 1938</ref> He continued by saying that \"the confession of the accused is not essential. The confession of the accused is a medieval principle of jurisprudence\" in a trial that was solely based on confessions. He finished his last plea with the words: \"the monstrousness of my crime is immeasurable especially in the new stage of struggle of the U.S.S.R. May this trial be the last severe lesson, and may the great might of the U.S.S.R. become clear to all.\"<ref>Robert Tucker, \"Report of Court Proceedings in the Case of the Anti-Soviet \"Block of Rights and Trotskyites\", pp. 667\u201368</ref>\n\n[[Romain Rolland]] and others wrote to Stalin seeking clemency for Bukharin, but all the leading defendants were executed except Rakovsky and two others (who were killed in [[Medvedev Forest massacre|NKVD prisoner massacres]] in 1941). Despite the promise to spare his family, Bukharin's wife, [[Anna Larina]], was sent to a labor camp, but she survived to see her husband posthumously [[Rehabilitation (Soviet)|rehabilitated]] a half-century later by the Soviet state under Mikhail Gorbachev in 1988.\n\n==\"De-kulakization\" and other \"anti-Soviet elements\"==\nOn 2 July 1937, Stalin sent a top-secret letter to all regional Party chiefs (with a copy to NKVD regional chiefs) ordering them to present, within five days, estimates of the number of kulaks and \"criminals\" that should be arrested, executed, or sent to camps. Produced in a matter of days, these figures roughly matched those of \"suspect\" individuals already under police surveillance, although the criteria used to distribute the \"kulak and criminal elements\" among the two categories are not clear.\n\nOn 30 July 1937 the [[NKVD Order no. 00447]] was issued, directed against \"ex-kulaks\" and other \"anti-Soviet elements\" (such as former officials of the [[Russian Empire|Tsarist regime]], former members of political parties other than the communist party, etc.). They were to be executed or sent to Gulag prison camps extrajudicially, under the decisions of NKVD troikas.\n\nThe following categories appear to have been on index-cards, catalogues of suspects assembled over the years by the NKVD and were systematically tracked down: \"ex-kulaks\" previously deported to \"[[Forced settlements in the Soviet Union|special settlements]]\" in inhospitable parts of the country ([[Siberia]], [[Urals]], Kazakhstan, [[Extreme North (Russia)|Far North]]), former tsarist civil servants, former officers of the [[White Army]], participants in peasant rebellions, members of the clergy, persons deprived of voting rights, former members of non-Bolshevik parties, ordinary criminals, like thieves, known to the police and various other \"socially harmful elements\". However, many were also arrested at random in police sweeps, or as a result of denunciations or simply because they happened to be relatives, friends or just acquaintances of people already arrested. Many railwaymen, workers, [[kolkhoz]] peasants, and engineers were arrested in the course of the \"Kulak Operation\" just because they had the misfortune of working in, or near, important strategic factories, railway or building sites, where, as a result of frantic rhythms and plans, many work accidents had occurred in previous years. In 1937\u20131938, the NKVD reopened these cases and systematically ascribed them to \"sabotage\" or \"wrecking\" (Werth, 2009).\n\n[[File:Evgeny Miller1.png|170px|thumb|[[Yevgeny Miller|Yevgeny-Ludvig Karlovich Miller]], one of the remaining leaders of the White movement, was kidnapped by the NKVD in 1937 and executed 19 months later.]]\nThe [[Russian Orthodox Church|Orthodox clergy]], including active parishioners, was nearly annihilated: 85% of the 35,000 members of the clergy were arrested. Particularly vulnerable to repression were also the so-called \"special settlers\" (''spetzpereselentsy'') who were under permanent police surveillance and constituted a huge pool of potential \"enemies\" to draw on. At least 100,000 of them were arrested in the course of the Great Terror.<ref name=\"sciencespo.fr\"/>\n\nCommon criminals such as thieves, \"violators of the passport regime\", etc. were also dealt with in a summary way. In Moscow, for example, nearly one third of the 20,765 persons executed on the [[Butovo firing range]] were charged with a non-political criminal offence.<ref name=\"sciencespo.fr\"/>\n\nAs soon as the Kulak Operation was launched (5 August 1937), regional party and NKVD bosses, eager to show their zeal, demanded an increase in the quotas. Accordingly, the quotas were increased. But this was not only the result of demands from below. The largest new allowances were distributed by Stalin and Yezhov on their own initiative: on 15 October 1937, for example, the Politburo passed a secret resolution increasing the number of people \"to be repressed\" by 120,000 (63,000 \"in the first category\" and 57,000 \"in the second category\"); on 31 January 1938, Stalin ordered a further increase of 57,200, 48,000 of whom were to be executed.\n\nThe police organized sweeps and round-ups of markets or railway stations where marginals and other social outcasts were likely to be found. To carry out a growing number of arrests, the State Security personnel of NKVD \u2013 approximately 25,000 officers \u2013 were supplemented by ordinary policemen, sometimes by civilian Party or [[Komsomol]] ([[Young Communist League]]) members.\n\nEvery NKVD local unit had a \"casework minimum\" of arrests to perform, and also of confessions to extract to \"unmask conspiracies\". The NKVD used uninterrupted interrogation for days on end and merciless beatings to force prisoners to confess their alleged \"counter-revolutionary\" crimes. To speed up the procedure, prisoners were often even forced to sign blank pages of the pre-printed interrogation folios on which the interrogator later typed up the confession.\n\nAfter the interrogations the files were submitted to NKVD troikas, which pronounced the verdicts in the absence of the accused. During a half-day-long session a troika went through several hundred cases, delivering either a death sentence or a sentence to the Gulag labor camps. Death sentences were immediately enforceable. The executions were carried out at night, either in prisons or in secluded areas run by the NKVD and located as a rule on the outskirts of major cities.<ref>[[Nicolas Werth]][http://www.massviolence.org/The-NKVD-Mass-Secret-Operation-no-00447-August-1937?artpage=2-6 Case Study:The NKVD Mass Secret Operation n\u00b0 00447 (August 1937 \u2013 November 1938)]</ref><ref>[[Nicolas Werth]][http://www.massviolence.org/The-NKVD-Mass-Secret-Operation-no-00447-August-1937?artpage=3-6 Case Study:The NKVD Mass Secret Operation n\u00b0 00447 (August 1937 \u2013 November 1938)]</ref>\n\nThe \"Kulak Operation\" was largest single campaign of repression in 1937\u201338, with 669,929 people arrested and 376,202 executed, more than half the total of known executions.{{sfn|Figes|2007|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=sge44FaZDREC&pg=PA240 240]}}\n\n==Campaigns targeting nationalities==\n{{Main|Mass operations of the NKVD}}\n[[File:Izrail Pliner NKVD.jpg|alt=|thumb|186x186px|[[Israel Pliner|Israil Pliner]]; (1896-1939)  chief of [[Gulag]] [[NKVD]] (1937-1938), later arrested and executed]]\nA series of [[mass operations of the NKVD]] was carried out from 1937 through 1938 until the [[Soviet invasion of Poland]] in 1939 targeting specific nationalities within the Soviet Union, based on NKVD directives against the so-called diversionist element, according to the notion of the \"hostile capitalist surrounding\" as defined by Nikolai Yezhov. \n\nThe [[Polish operation of the NKVD]] was the largest of this kind.{{sfn|Snyder|2010|pp=103\u2013104}} The Polish operation claimed the largest number of the NKVD victims: 143,810 arrests and 111,091 executions according to records.

This revealed the full enormity of the Purges.

In his secret speech to the [[20th Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union|20th]] [[Communist Party of the Soviet Union|CPSU]] congress in February 1956 (which was made public a month later), Khrushchev referred to the purges as an \"abuse of power\" by Stalin which resulted in enormous harm to the country. In the same speech, he recognized that many of the victims were innocent and were convicted on the basis of false confessions extracted by torture. To take that position was politically useful to Khrushchev, as he was at that time engaged in a power struggle with rivals who had been associated with the Purge, the so-called [[Anti-Party Group]]. The new line on the Great Purges undermined their power, and helped propel him to the Chairmanship of the Council of Ministers. Starting from 1954, some of the convictions were overturned. Mikhail Tukhachevsky and other generals convicted in the Trial of Red Army Generals were declared innocent (\"[[Rehabilitation (Soviet)|rehabilitated]]\") in 1957. The former Politburo members [[Yan Rudzutak]] and [[Stanislav Kosior]] and many lower-level victims were also declared innocent in the 1950s. Nikolai Bukharin and others convicted in the Moscow Trials were not rehabilitated until as late as 1988. Leon Trotsky, considered a major player in the Russian Revolution and a major contributor to [[Marxist theory]], was never rehabilitated by the USSR.

They were given the task to investigate the materials concerning Bukharin, Rykov, Zinoviev, Tukhachevsky, and others. The commission worked in 1956\u20131957. While stating that the accusations against Tukhachevsky ''et al.'' should be abandoned, it failed to fully rehabilitate the victims of the three Moscow trials, although the final report does contain an admission that the accusations have not been proven during the trials and \"evidence\" had been produced by lies, blackmail, and \"use of physical influence\". Bukharin, Rykov, Zinoviev, and others were still seen as political opponents, and though the charges against them were obviously false, they could not have been rehabilitated because \"for many years they headed the anti-Soviet struggle against the building of socialism in USSR\".\n\nThe second commission largely worked from 1961 to 1963 and was headed by Shvernik (\"[[Shvernik Commission]]\"). It included [[Alexander Shelepin|Shelepin]], Serdyuk, Mironov, Rudenko, and Semichastny. The hard work resulted in two massive reports, which detailed the mechanism of falsification of the show-trials against Bukharin, Zinoviev, Tukhachevsky, and many others. The commission based its findings in large part on eyewitness testimonies of former NKVD workers and victims of repressions, and on many documents. The commission recommended rehabilitating every accused with the exceptions of Radek and Yagoda, because Radek's materials required some further checking, and Yagoda was a criminal and one of the falsifiers of the trials (though most of the charges against him had to be dropped too, he was not a \"spy\", etc.). The commission stated:\n\n<blockquote>Stalin committed a very grave crime against the Communist party, the socialist state, Soviet people and worldwide revolutionary movement...Together with Stalin, the responsibility for the abuse of law, mass unwarranted repressions and death of many thousands of wholly innocent people also lies on Molotov, Kaganovich, Malenkov....{{citation needed|date=June 2012}}</blockquote>\n\nMolotov stated \"We would have been complete idiots if we had taken the reports at their face value.

According to one interpretation, Stalin's regime had to maintain its citizens in a state of fear and uncertainty to stay in power (Brzezinski, 1958). Robert Conquest emphasized Stalin's paranoia, focused on the Moscow show trial of \"Old Bolsheviks\", and analyzed the carefully planned and systematic destruction of the Communist Party. Some others view the Great Purge as a crucial moment, or rather the culmination, of a vast [[Social engineering (political science)|social engineering]] campaign started at the beginning of the 1930s (Hagenloh, 2000; Shearer, 2003; Werth, 2003).<ref name=werth>{{cite web|first=Nicolas|last=Werth |authorlink=Nicolas Werth|url=http://www.sciencespo.fr/mass-violence-war-massacre-resistance/en/document/nkvd-mass-secret-national-operations-august-1937-november-1938|title=Case Study:The NKVD Mass Secret Operation n\u00b0 00447 (August 1937 \u2013 November 1938)|publisher=Mass Violence and Resistance \u2013 Research Network|date=15 April 2019 }}</ref>\n\nAccording to historian James Harris, contemporary archival research pokes \"rather large holes in the traditional story\" weaved by Conquest and others.{{sfn|Harris|2017|pp=2\u20134}} His findings, while not exonerating Stalin or the Soviet state, dispel the notion that the bloodletting was merely the result of Stalin attempting to establish his own personal dictatorship; evidence suggests he was committed to building the socialist state envisioned by Lenin. The real motivation for the terror, according to Harris, was an exaggerated fear of counterrevolution.{{sfn|Harris|2017|p=16}}\n\n<blockquote>So what was the motivation behind the Terror? The answers required a lot more digging, but it gradually became clearer that the violence of the late 1930s was driven by fear. Most Bolsheviks, Stalin among them, believed that the revolutions of 1789, 1848 and 1871 had failed because their leaders hadn't adequately anticipated the ferocity of the counter-revolutionary reaction from the establishment. They were determined not to make the same mistake.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://historynewsnetwork.org/article/163498|title=Historian James Harris says Russian archives show we've misunderstood Stalin|last=Harris |first=James |date=July 26, 2016 |website=[[History News Network]]|access-date=December 1, 2018 |quote=}}</ref></blockquote>\n\nTwo major lines of interpretation have emerged among historians.  One argues that the purges reflected Stalin's ambitions, his paranoia, and his inner drive to increase his power and eliminate potential rivals. Revisionist historians explain the purges by theorizing that rival factions exploited Stalin's paranoia and used terror to enhance their own position.  Peter Whitewood examines the first purge, directed at the Army, and comes up with a third interpretation that,  Stalin and other top leaders believing that they were always surrounded by capitalist enemies, always worried about the vulnerability and loyalty of the Red Army.<ref>James Harris, \"Encircled by Enemies: Stalin\u2019s Perceptions of the Capitalist World, 1918\u20131941,\u201d ''Journal of Strategic Studies'' 30#3 [2007]: 513\u2013545.</ref> It was not a ploy \u2013 Stalin truly believed it. \u201cStalin attacked the Red Army because he seriously misperceived a serious security threat\u201d; thus \u201cStalin seems to have genuinely believed that foreign\u2010backed enemies had infiltrated the ranks and managed to organize a conspiracy at the very heart of the Red Army.\u201d  The purge hit deeply from June 1937 and November 1938, removing 35,000; many were executed. Experience in carrying out the purge facilitated purging other key elements in the wider Soviet polity.<ref>Peter Whitewood, ''The Red Army and the Great Terror: Stalin\u2019s Purge of the Soviet Military'' (2015) Quoting pp 12, 276.</ref><ref>Ronald Grigor Suny, review, ''Historian'' (2018) 80#1:177-79.</ref><ref>For a critique of Whitewood see Alexander Hill, review, ''American Historical Review'' (2017) 122#5 pp 1713-1714.</ref> Historians often cite the disruption as factors in the Red Army's disastrous military performance during the German invasion.<ref>Roger R.

Together these two actions accounted for nine tenths of the death sentences and three fourths of Gulag sentences. Out of the operations against national minorities, the [[Polish Operation of the NKVD]] was the largest one, second only to the \"Kulak Operation\" in terms of number of victims. According to historian [[Timothy Snyder]], ethnic Poles constituted the largest group of victims in the Great Terror, comprising less than 0.5% of the country's population but comprising 12.5% of those executed.<ref>[[Timothy Snyder|Snyder, Timothy]].

Historians debate the causes of the purge, such as Stalin's paranoia, or his desire to remove dissenters from the [[Communist Party of the Soviet Union|Communist Party]] or to consolidate his authority.  The purges began in the Red Army, and the techniques developed there were quickly adapted to purges in other sectors.<ref>Peter Whitewood,  \"The Purge of the Red Army and the Soviet Mass Operations, 1937\u201338.\" ''Slavonic & East European Review'' 93.2 (2015): 286-314.

The campaigns also affected many other categories of the society: intelligentsia, peasants and especially those branded as \"too rich for a peasant\" ([[kulak]]s), and professionals.{{sfn|Conquest|2008|pp=250,&nbsp;257\u20138}} A series of NKVD operations affected a number of national minorities, accused of being \"[[fifth column]]\" communities. A number of purges were officially explained as an elimination of the possibilities of sabotage and espionage, by the [[Polish Military Organisation]] and, consequently, many victims of the purge were ordinary [[Poles in the former Soviet Union|Soviet citizens of Polish origin]].\n\nAccording to [[Nikita Khrushchev]]'s 1956 speech, \"[[On the Cult of Personality and Its Consequences]]\", and historian Robert Conquest, a great number of accusations, notably those presented at the [[Moscow Trials|Moscow show trial]]s, were based on [[forced confession]]s, often obtained through [[torture]],{{sfn|Conquest|2008|p=121 which cites his secret speech}} and on loose interpretations of [[Article 58 (RSFSR Penal Code)|Article 58 of the RSFSR Penal Code]], which dealt with counter-revolutionary crimes.

Many died at the penal labor camps of starvation, disease, exposure, and overwork. Other methods of dispatching victims were used on an experimental basis.

The campaigns were carried out according to the [[general line (party)|general line]], often by direct orders of the [[Politburo of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union|Party Politburo]] headed by Stalin.\n\n==Background==\n{{see also|Purges of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union}}\nFrom 1930 onwards, the Party and police officials feared the \"social disorder\" caused by the upheavals of [[Collectivization in the Soviet Union|forced collectivization of peasants]] and the resulting [[Soviet famine of 1932\u20131933|famine of 1932\u20131933]], as well as the massive and uncontrolled migration of millions of peasants into cities. The threat of war heightened Stalin's perception of marginal and politically suspect populations as the potential source of an uprising in case of invasion. He began to plan for the preventive elimination of such potential recruits for a mythical \"fifth column of wreckers, terrorists and spies.\" (Hagenloh, 2000; Shearer, 2003).<ref name=werth/>\n\n[[Image:Bundesarchiv Bild 183-R15068, Leo Dawidowitsch Trotzki.jpg|thumb|upright|left|[[Leon Trotsky]], in 1929, shortly before being driven out of the Soviet Union.]]\nThe term \"[[purge]]\" in Soviet political slang was an abbreviation of the expression ''purge of the Party ranks''. In 1933, for example, the Party expelled some 400,000 people. But from 1936 until 1953, the term changed its meaning, because being expelled from the Party came to mean almost certain arrest, imprisonment, and often execution.\n\nThe political purge was primarily an effort by Stalin to eliminate challenge from past and potential opposition groups, including the left and right wings led by [[Leon Trotsky]] and [[Nikolai Bukharin]], respectively. Following the [[Russian Civil War|Civil War]] and reconstruction of the Soviet economy in the late 1920s, veteran Bolsheviks no longer thought necessary the \"temporary\" wartime dictatorship, which had passed from Lenin to Stalin. Stalin's opponents on both sides of the political spectrum chided him as undemocratic and lax on bureaucratic corruption. This opposition to current leadership may have accumulated substantial support among the working class by attacking the privileges and luxuries the state offered to its high-paid elite. The [[Ryutin Affair]] seemed to vindicate Stalin's suspicions. He enforced a ban on party factions and banned those party members who had opposed him, effectively ending [[democratic centralism]].\n\nIn the new form of Party organization, the Politburo, and Stalin in particular, were the sole dispensers of ideology. This required the elimination of all Marxists with different views, especially those among the prestigious \"old guard\" of revolutionaries. As the purges began, the government (through the NKVD) shot Bolshevik heroes, including [[Mikhail Tukhachevsky]] and [[B\u00e9la Kun]], as well as the majority of Lenin's Politburo, for disagreements in policy. The NKVD attacked the supporters, friends, and family of these \"heretical\" Marxists, whether they lived in Russia or not. The NKVD nearly annihilated Trotsky's family before [[Leon Trotsky#Assassination|killing]] him in Mexico; the NKVD agent [[Ram\u00f3n Mercader]] was part of an assassination task force put together by Special Agent [[Pavel Sudoplatov]], under the personal orders of Stalin.{{sfn|Andrew|Mitrokhin|2000|pp=86\u20137}}\n\n[[Image:Sergei Kirov and Joseph Stalin, 1934.jpg|thumb|[[Saint Petersburg|Leningrad]] party leader [[Sergey Kirov|Sergei Kirov]] with [[Joseph Stalin|Stalin]] (and his daughter [[Svetlana Alliluyeva|Svetlana]]) in 1934.]]\nIn 1934, Stalin used the murder of [[Sergey Kirov]] as a pretext to launch the Great Purge, in which about a million people perished (see {{section link||Number of people executed}}). Some later historians came to believe that Stalin arranged the murder, or at least that there was sufficient evidence to reach such a conclusion.{{sfn|Conquest|1987|pp=122\u201338}} Kirov was a staunch Stalin loyalist, but Stalin may have viewed him as a potential rival because of his emerging popularity among the moderates. The [[17th Congress of the All-Union Communist Party (Bolsheviks)|1934 Party Congress]] elected Kirov to the central committee with only three votes against, the fewest of any candidate, while Stalin received 292 votes against. After Kirov's assassination, the NKVD charged the former oppositionists, an ever-growing group according to their determination, with Kirov's murder as well as a growing list of other offences, including treason, terrorism, sabotage, and espionage.\n\nAnother justification for the purge was to remove any possible \"fifth column\" in case of a war. [[Vyacheslav Molotov]] and [[Lazar Kaganovich]], participants in the repression as members of the Politburo, maintained this justification throughout the purge; they each signed many death lists.{{sfn|Figes|2007|p=239}} Stalin believed war was imminent, threatened both by an explicitly hostile Germany and an expansionist Japan.

These trials were highly publicized and extensively covered by the outside world, which was mesmerized by the spectacle of Lenin's closest associates confessing to most outrageous crimes and begging for death sentences.\n\n*The first trial was of 16 members of the so-called \"Trotskyite-Kamenevite-Zinovievite-Leftist-Counter-Revolutionary Bloc\",{{citation needed|date=January 2012}} held in August 1936,<ref>Rogovin (1998), pp. 17\u201318</ref> at which the chief defendants were [[Grigory Zinoviev]] and [[Lev Kamenev]], two of the most prominent former party leaders.

Thirteen of the defendants were eventually executed by shooting. The rest received sentences in labor camps where they soon died.\n*There was also a secret trial before a military tribunal of a group of Red Army commanders, including Mikhail Tukhachevsky, in June 1937.\n\n[[File:Radek's action.jpg|thumb|Prosecutor General [[Andrey Vyshinsky]] (centre), reading the 1937 indictment against [[Karl Radek]] during the 2nd [[Moscow Trials|Moscow Trial]]]]\nSome Western observers who attended the trials said that they were fair and that the guilt of the accused had been established. They based this assessment on the confessions of the accused, which were freely given in open court, without any apparent evidence that they had been extracted by torture or drugging. The British lawyer and Member of Parliament [[D.N. Pritt]], for example, wrote: \"Once again the more faint-hearted socialists are beset with doubts and anxieties\", but \"once again we can feel confident that when the smoke has rolled away from the battlefield of controversy it will be realized that the charge was true, the confessions correct and the prosecution fairly conducted\".\n\nIt is now known that the confessions were given only after great psychological pressure and torture had been applied to the defendants. From the accounts of former [[OGPU]] officer [[Alexander Mikhailovich Orlov|Alexander Orlov]] and others, the methods used to extract the confessions are known: such tortures as repeated beatings, simulated drownings, making prisoners stand or go without sleep for days on end, and threats to arrest and execute the prisoners' families. For example, Kamenev's teenage son was arrested and charged with terrorism. After months of such interrogation, the defendants were driven to despair and exhaustion.\n\nZinoviev and Kamenev demanded, as a condition for \"confessing\", a direct guarantee from the Politburo that their lives and that of their families and followers would be spared. This offer was accepted, but when they were taken to the alleged Politburo meeting, only Stalin, [[Kliment Voroshilov]], and Yezhov were present. Stalin claimed that they were the \"commission\" authorized by the Politburo and gave assurances that death sentences would not be carried out. After the trial, Stalin not only broke his promise to spare the defendants, he had most of their relatives arrested and shot.{{sfn|Conquest|2008|p=87}}\n\n====Dewey Commission====\n[[File:Vassily Blokhin.jpg|thumb|right|180px|The chief executioner of the NKVD, [[Vasili Blokhin]], carried out some of the high-profile executions during the purges.<ref>[[Timothy Snyder|Snyder, Timothy]].

The commission was headed by the noted American philosopher and educator [[John Dewey]]. Although the hearings were obviously conducted with a view to proving Trotsky's innocence, they brought to light evidence which established that some of the specific charges made at the trials could not be true.{{sfn|Snyder|2010|p=137}}\n\nFor example, [[Georgy Pyatakov]] testified that he had flown to [[Oslo]] in December 1935 to \"receive terrorist instructions\" from Trotsky. The Dewey Commission established that no such flight had taken place.<ref>{{Cite book|url=|title=Not guilty : report of the Commission of Inquiry Into the Charges Made Against Leon Trotsky in the Moscow Trials|last=Dewey|first=John|publisher=Sam Sloan and Ishi Press International|others=1859-1952|year=2008|isbn=978-0923891312|location=New York|pages=154\u2013155|oclc=843206645}}</ref> Another defendant, [[Ivan N. Smirnov|Ivan Smirnov]], confessed to taking part in the assassination of Sergei Kirov in December 1934, at a time when he had already been in prison for a year.\n\nThe Dewey Commission later published its findings in a 422-page book titled ''Not Guilty''. Its conclusions asserted the innocence of all those condemned in the Moscow Trials. In its summary, the commission wrote:\n{{quote|Independent of extrinsic evidence, the Commission finds:\n*That the conduct of the Moscow Trials was such as to convince any unprejudiced person that no attempt was made to ascertain the truth.\n*That while confessions are necessarily entitled to the most serious consideration, the confessions themselves contain such inherent improbabilities as to convince the Commission that they do not represent the truth, irrespective of any means used to obtain them.\n*That Trotsky never instructed any of the accused or witnesses in the Moscow trials to enter into agreements with foreign powers against the Soviet Union [and] that Trotsky never recommended, plotted, or attempted the restoration of capitalism in the USSR.}}\n\nThe commission concluded: \"We therefore find the Moscow Trials to be frame-ups.\"\n\n====Implication of the Rightists====\nIn the second trial, Karl Radek testified that there was a \"third organization separate from the cadres which had passed through [Trotsky's] school\"<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">British Embassy Report: Viscount Chilston to Mr. Eden, 6 February 1937</ref> as well as \"semi-Trotskyites, quarter-Trotskyites, one-eighth-Trotskyites, people who helped us, not knowing of the terrorist organization but sympathizing with us, people who from liberalism, from a Fronde against the Party, gave us this help.\"{{sfn|Conquest|2008|p=164}}\n\nBy the \"third organization\", he meant the last remaining former opposition group called the [[Right Opposition|Rightists]], led by Bukharin, whom he implicated by saying:\n\n{{quote|I feel guilty of one thing more: even after admitting my guilt and exposing the organisation, I stubbornly refused to give evidence about Bukharin. I knew that Bukharin's situation was just as hopeless as my own, because our guilt, if not juridically, then in essence, was the same. But we are close friends, and intellectual friendship is stronger than other friendships. I knew that Bukharin was in the same state of upheaval as myself. That is why I did not want to deliver him bound hand and foot to the People's Commissariat of Home Affairs. Just as in relation to our other cadres, I wanted Bukharin himself to lay down his arms.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/>}}\n\n===Third Moscow Trial===\n[[File:1934 agranov yagoda unknown redens.jpg|thumb|NKVD chiefs responsible for conducting mass repressions:  From l. to r.: [[Yakov Agranov]]; [[Genrikh Yagoda]]; unknown; [[Stanislav Redens]]. All three were themselves eventually arrested and executed.]]\nThe third and final trial, in March 1938, known as [[The Trial of the Twenty-One]], is the most famous of the Soviet show trials, because of persons involved and the scope of charges which tied together all loose threads from earlier trials. Meant to be the culmination of previous trials, it included 21 defendants alleged to belong to the so-called \"Bloc of Rightists and Trotskyites\", led by Nikolai Bukharin, the former chairman of the [[Communist International]], former premier [[Alexei Rykov]], [[Christian Rakovsky]], [[Nikolai Krestinsky]] and [[Genrikh Yagoda]], recently disgraced head of the NKVD.\n\nThe fact that Yagoda was one of the accused showed the speed at which the purges were consuming their own. It was now alleged that Bukharin and others sought to assassinate Lenin and Stalin from 1918, murder [[Maxim Gorky]] by poison, partition the U.S.S.R and hand her territories to Germany, Japan, and Great Britain, and other preposterous charges.\n\nEven previously sympathetic observers who had stomached the earlier trials found it harder to swallow these new allegations as they became ever more absurd, and the purge expanded to include almost every living Old Bolshevik leader except Stalin. No other crime of the Stalin years so captivated Western intellectuals as the trial and execution of Bukharin, who was a Marxist theorist of international standing.<ref name=\"Corey Robin, Fear, Page 96\">Corey Robin, \"Fear\", Page 96</ref> For some prominent communists such as [[Bertram Wolfe]], [[Jay Lovestone]], [[Arthur Koestler]], and [[Heinrich Brandler]], the Bukharin trial marked their final break with communism, and even turned the first three into fervent anti-Communists eventually.<ref>Bertram David Wolfe, \"Breaking with communism\", p. 10</ref>{{sfn|Koestler|1940|p=258}} To them, Bukharin's confession symbolized the\ndepredations of communism, which not only destroyed its sons but also conscripted them in self-destruction and individual abnegation.<ref name=\"Corey Robin, Fear, Page 96\"/>\n\nThe preparation for this trial, which took over a year, was delayed in its early stages due to the reluctance of some party members to denounce their comrades. It was at this time that Stalin personally intervened to speed up the process and replaced Yagoda with Yezhov.\n\n====Bukharin's confession====\n[[File:Bucharin.bra.jpg|thumb|170px|[[Nikolai Bukharin]], Russian [[Bolshevik]] [[Russian Revolution|revolutionary]] executed in 1938]]\nOn the first day of trial, Krestinsky caused a sensation when he repudiated his written confession and pleaded not guilty to all the charges. However, he changed his plea the next day after \"special measures\", which dislocated his left shoulder among other things.{{sfn|Conquest|2008|p=352}}\n\n[[Anastas Mikoyan]] and Vyacheslav Molotov later claimed that Bukharin was never tortured, but it is now known that his interrogators were given the order \"beating permitted\", and were under great pressure to extract confession out of the \"star\" defendant. Bukharin initially held out for three months, but threats to his young wife and infant son, combined with \"methods of physical influence\" wore him down. But when he read his confession amended and corrected personally by Stalin, he withdrew his whole confession. The examination started all over again, with a double team of interrogators.{{sfn|Conquest|2008|p=364\u20135}}\n\nBukharin's confession in particular became subject of much debate among Western observers, inspiring Koestler's acclaimed novel ''[[Darkness at Noon]]'' and philosophical essay by [[Maurice Merleau-Ponty]] in ''Humanism and Terror''. His confessions were somewhat different from others in that while he pleaded guilty to \"sum total of crimes\", he denied knowledge when it came to specific crimes. Some astute observers noted that he would allow only what was in written confession and refuse to go any further.\n\nThe result was a curious mix of fulsome confessions (of being a \"degenerate fascist\" working for \"restoration of capitalism\") and subtle criticisms of the trial. After disproving several charges against him, one observer noted that Bukharin \"proceeded to demolish or rather showed he could very easily demolish the whole case\".<ref>Report by Viscount Chilston (British ambassador) to Viscount Halifax, No.141, Moscow, 21 March 1938</ref> He continued by saying that \"the confession of the accused is not essential. The confession of the accused is a medieval principle of jurisprudence\" in a trial that was solely based on confessions. He finished his last plea with the words: \"the monstrousness of my crime is immeasurable especially in the new stage of struggle of the U.S.S.R. May this trial be the last severe lesson, and may the great might of the U.S.S.R. become clear to all.\"<ref>Robert Tucker, \"Report of Court Proceedings in the Case of the Anti-Soviet \"Block of Rights and Trotskyites\", pp. 667\u201368</ref>\n\n[[Romain Rolland]] and others wrote to Stalin seeking clemency for Bukharin, but all the leading defendants were executed except Rakovsky and two others (who were killed in [[Medvedev Forest massacre|NKVD prisoner massacres]] in 1941). Despite the promise to spare his family, Bukharin's wife, [[Anna Larina]], was sent to a labor camp, but she survived to see her husband posthumously [[Rehabilitation (Soviet)|rehabilitated]] a half-century later by the Soviet state under Mikhail Gorbachev in 1988.\n\n==\"De-kulakization\" and other \"anti-Soviet elements\"==\nOn 2 July 1937, Stalin sent a top-secret letter to all regional Party chiefs (with a copy to NKVD regional chiefs) ordering them to present, within five days, estimates of the number of kulaks and \"criminals\" that should be arrested, executed, or sent to camps. Produced in a matter of days, these figures roughly matched those of \"suspect\" individuals already under police surveillance, although the criteria used to distribute the \"kulak and criminal elements\" among the two categories are not clear.\n\nOn 30 July 1937 the [[NKVD Order no. 00447]] was issued, directed against \"ex-kulaks\" and other \"anti-Soviet elements\" (such as former officials of the [[Russian Empire|Tsarist regime]], former members of political parties other than the communist party, etc.). They were to be executed or sent to Gulag prison camps extrajudicially, under the decisions of NKVD troikas.\n\nThe following categories appear to have been on index-cards, catalogues of suspects assembled over the years by the NKVD and were systematically tracked down: \"ex-kulaks\" previously deported to \"[[Forced settlements in the Soviet Union|special settlements]]\" in inhospitable parts of the country ([[Siberia]], [[Urals]], Kazakhstan, [[Extreme North (Russia)|Far North]]), former tsarist civil servants, former officers of the [[White Army]], participants in peasant rebellions, members of the clergy, persons deprived of voting rights, former members of non-Bolshevik parties, ordinary criminals, like thieves, known to the police and various other \"socially harmful elements\". However, many were also arrested at random in police sweeps, or as a result of denunciations or simply because they happened to be relatives, friends or just acquaintances of people already arrested. Many railwaymen, workers, [[kolkhoz]] peasants, and engineers were arrested in the course of the \"Kulak Operation\" just because they had the misfortune of working in, or near, important strategic factories, railway or building sites, where, as a result of frantic rhythms and plans, many work accidents had occurred in previous years. In 1937\u20131938, the NKVD reopened these cases and systematically ascribed them to \"sabotage\" or \"wrecking\" (Werth, 2009).\n\n[[File:Evgeny Miller1.png|170px|thumb|[[Yevgeny Miller|Yevgeny-Ludvig Karlovich Miller]], one of the remaining leaders of the White movement, was kidnapped by the NKVD in 1937 and executed 19 months later.]]\nThe [[Russian Orthodox Church|Orthodox clergy]], including active parishioners, was nearly annihilated: 85% of the 35,000 members of the clergy were arrested. Particularly vulnerable to repression were also the so-called \"special settlers\" (''spetzpereselentsy'') who were under permanent police surveillance and constituted a huge pool of potential \"enemies\" to draw on. At least 100,000 of them were arrested in the course of the Great Terror.<ref name=\"sciencespo.fr\"/>\n\nCommon criminals such as thieves, \"violators of the passport regime\", etc. were also dealt with in a summary way. In Moscow, for example, nearly one third of the 20,765 persons executed on the [[Butovo firing range]] were charged with a non-political criminal offence.<ref name=\"sciencespo.fr\"/>\n\nAs soon as the Kulak Operation was launched (5 August 1937), regional party and NKVD bosses, eager to show their zeal, demanded an increase in the quotas. Accordingly, the quotas were increased. But this was not only the result of demands from below. The largest new allowances were distributed by Stalin and Yezhov on their own initiative: on 15 October 1937, for example, the Politburo passed a secret resolution increasing the number of people \"to be repressed\" by 120,000 (63,000 \"in the first category\" and 57,000 \"in the second category\"); on 31 January 1938, Stalin ordered a further increase of 57,200, 48,000 of whom were to be executed.\n\nThe police organized sweeps and round-ups of markets or railway stations where marginals and other social outcasts were likely to be found. To carry out a growing number of arrests, the State Security personnel of NKVD \u2013 approximately 25,000 officers \u2013 were supplemented by ordinary policemen, sometimes by civilian Party or [[Komsomol]] ([[Young Communist League]]) members.\n\nEvery NKVD local unit had a \"casework minimum\" of arrests to perform, and also of confessions to extract to \"unmask conspiracies\". The NKVD used uninterrupted interrogation for days on end and merciless beatings to force prisoners to confess their alleged \"counter-revolutionary\" crimes. To speed up the procedure, prisoners were often even forced to sign blank pages of the pre-printed interrogation folios on which the interrogator later typed up the confession.\n\nAfter the interrogations the files were submitted to NKVD troikas, which pronounced the verdicts in the absence of the accused.

Lavrentiy Beria, a fellow Georgian and Stalin confidant, succeeded him as head of NKVD. On 17 November 1938 a joint decree of [[Sovnarkom]] USSR and [[Central Committee]] of VKP(b) ([[Decree about Arrests, Prosecutor Supervision and Course of Investigation]]) and the subsequent order of NKVD undersigned by Beria, cancelled most of the [[Mass operations of the NKVD|NKVD orders of systematic repression]] and suspended implementation of death sentences. The decree signaled the end of massive Soviet purges.{{Sfn|Hedeler, Wladislaw|Rosenblum, Nadja 2001|p=23}}\n\nNevertheless, the practice of mass arrest and exile continued until Stalin's death in 1953. Political executions also continued, but, with the exception of [[Katyn Massacre|Katyn]] and other [[NKVD prisoner massacres|NKVD massacres]] during [[World War II]], on a vastly smaller scale. One notorious example is the \"[[Night of the Murdered Poets]]\", in which at least thirteen prominent Yiddish writers were executed on 12 August 1952. Historians such as [[Michael Parrish]] have argued that while the Great Terror ended in 1938, a lesser terror continued in the 1940s.{{sfn|Parrish|1996|p=32}} [[Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn]] (a Soviet Army officer who became a prisoner for a decade in the Gulag system) presents in ''[[The Gulag Archipelago]]'' the most holistic view of the timeline of ''all'' the Leninist and Stalinist purges (1918\u20131956), in which the 1936\u20131938 purge may have been simply the one that got the most attention from people in a position to record its magnitude for posterity\u2014the intelligentsia\u2014by directly targeting them, whereas several other waves of the ongoing flow of purges, such as the [[first five-year plan|1928\u20131933 collectivization and dekulakization]], were just as huge and just as devoid of justice but were more successfully swallowed into oblivion in the popular memory of the (surviving) Soviet public.{{sfn|Solzhenitsyn|1973}} For example, in one such passage Solzhenitsyn mentions 1938 and says that 1948 was in some ways hardly better.\n\nIn some cases, high military command arrested under Yezhov were later executed under Beria.

He called them in 1941 \"the great purges\", and described how over four years they affected \"the top fourth or fifth, to estimate it conservatively, of the Party itself, of the Army, Navy, and Air Force leaders and then of the new Bolshevik intelligentsia, the foremost technicians, managers, supervisors, scientists\". Knickerbocker also wrote about dekulakization: \"It is a conservative estimate to say that some 5,000,000 [kulaks] ... died at once, or within a few years.\"<ref name=\"knickerbocker1941\">{{cite book | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=RwGwpIBHhgcC&lpg=PR2&pg=PA133#v=onepage&q&f=false | title=Is Tomorrow Hitler's? 200 Questions on the Battle of Mankind | publisher=Reynal & Hitchcock | author=Knickerbocker, H.R. | year=1941 | pages=133\u2013134| isbn=9781417992775 }}</ref>\n\nEvidence and the results of research began to appear after Stalin's death. This revealed the full enormity of the Purges. The first of these sources were the revelations of Nikita Khrushchev, which particularly affected the American editors of the [[Communist Party USA]] newspaper, the ''[[Daily Worker]]'', who, following the lead of ''The New York Times'', published the [[On the Cult of Personality and Its Consequences|Secret Speech]] in full.<ref>[http://www.trussel.com/hf/onleave.htm On Leaving the Communist Party] by Howard Fast, 16 November 1957</ref>\n\n==Rehabilitation==\n{{Main|Rehabilitation (Soviet)}}\n[[Image:USSR stamp M.Tukhachevsky 1963 4k.jpg|thumb|right|Posthumously rehabilitated, Tukhachevsky on a 1963 postage stamp of the Soviet Union]]\n[[File:WP 20130802 006.jpg|thumb|Monument dedicated to the victims of the repressions in [[Ulaanbaatar]], Mongolia]]\nThe Great Purge was denounced by Soviet leader Nikita Khrushchev following Stalin's death. In his secret speech to the [[20th Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union|20th]] [[Communist Party of the Soviet Union|CPSU]] congress in February 1956 (which was made public a month later), Khrushchev referred to the purges as an \"abuse of power\" by Stalin which resulted in enormous harm to the country. In the same speech, he recognized that many of the victims were innocent and were convicted on the basis of false confessions extracted by torture. To take that position was politically useful to Khrushchev, as he was at that time engaged in a power struggle with rivals who had been associated with the Purge, the so-called [[Anti-Party Group]]. The new line on the Great Purges undermined their power, and helped propel him to the Chairmanship of the Council of Ministers. Starting from 1954, some of the convictions were overturned. Mikhail Tukhachevsky and other generals convicted in the Trial of Red Army Generals were declared innocent (\"[[Rehabilitation (Soviet)|rehabilitated]]\") in 1957. The former Politburo members [[Yan Rudzutak]] and [[Stanislav Kosior]] and many lower-level victims were also declared innocent in the 1950s. Nikolai Bukharin and others convicted in the Moscow Trials were not rehabilitated until as late as 1988. Leon Trotsky, considered a major player in the Russian Revolution and a major contributor to [[Marxist theory]], was never rehabilitated by the USSR. The book ''Rehabilitation: The Political Processes of the 1930s\u201350s'' (\u0420\u0435\u0430\u0431\u0438\u043b\u0438\u0442\u0430\u0446\u0438\u044f. \u041f\u043e\u043b\u0438\u0442\u0438\u0447\u0435\u0441\u043a\u0438\u0435 \u043f\u0440\u043e\u0446\u0435\u0441\u0441\u044b 30-50-\u0445 \u0433\u043e\u0434\u043e\u0432) (1991) contains a large amount of newly presented original archive material: transcripts of interrogations, letters of convicts, and photos.

They were given the task to investigate the materials concerning Bukharin, Rykov, Zinoviev, Tukhachevsky, and others. The commission worked in 1956\u20131957. While stating that the accusations against Tukhachevsky ''et al.'' should be abandoned, it failed to fully rehabilitate the victims of the three Moscow trials, although the final report does contain an admission that the accusations have not been proven during the trials and \"evidence\" had been produced by lies, blackmail, and \"use of physical influence\". Bukharin, Rykov, Zinoviev, and others were still seen as political opponents, and though the charges against them were obviously false, they could not have been rehabilitated because \"for many years they headed the anti-Soviet struggle against the building of socialism in USSR\".\n\nThe second commission largely worked from 1961 to 1963 and was headed by Shvernik (\"[[Shvernik Commission]]\"). It included [[Alexander Shelepin|Shelepin]], Serdyuk, Mironov, Rudenko, and Semichastny. The hard work resulted in two massive reports, which detailed the mechanism of falsification of the show-trials against Bukharin, Zinoviev, Tukhachevsky, and many others. The commission based its findings in large part on eyewitness testimonies of former NKVD workers and victims of repressions, and on many documents. The commission recommended rehabilitating every accused with the exceptions of Radek and Yagoda, because Radek's materials required some further checking, and Yagoda was a criminal and one of the falsifiers of the trials (though most of the charges against him had to be dropped too, he was not a \"spy\", etc.). The commission stated:\n\n<blockquote>Stalin committed a very grave crime against the Communist party, the socialist state, Soviet people and worldwide revolutionary movement...Together with Stalin, the responsibility for the abuse of law, mass unwarranted repressions and death of many thousands of wholly innocent people also lies on Molotov, Kaganovich, Malenkov....{{citation needed|date=June 2012}}</blockquote>\n\nMolotov stated \"We would have been complete idiots if we had taken the reports at their face value.

In 1990, a boulder stone was brought from the former [[Solovki prison camp]] in the White Sea, and erected next to KGB headquarters in Moscow as a memorial to all \"the victims of political repression\" since 1917.\n\nFollowing the collapse of the Soviet Union, many more mass graves filled with executed victims of the terror were discovered and turned into memorial sites.<ref>[http://www.cnn.com/WORLD/9707/17/russia.gulag.grave/index.html \"Pictorial essay: Death trenches bear witness to Stalin's purges\"] [[CNN]], 17 July 1997</ref><ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/europe/2131954.stm \"Mass grave found at Ukrainian monastery\"], [[BBC]], 12 July 2002</ref><ref>[http://www.csmonitor.com/2002/1010/p01s02-woeu.html \"Wary of its past, Russia ignores mass grave site\"], by [[Fred Weir]], ''[[The Christian Science Monitor]]'', 10 October 2002</ref><ref>[https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSTRE6584HJ20100609 Stalin-era mass grave yields tons of bones] [[Reuters]]. 9 June 2010</ref> Some, such as the killing fields [[Bykivnia]] near [[Kiev]], are said to contain up to 200,000 corpses.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://users.erols.com/mwhite28/battles.htm#Bykivnia|title=WAR STATS REDIRECT|publisher=erols.com}}</ref>{{Better source|date=June 2012}}\n\nIn 2007, one such site, the Butovo firing range near Moscow, was turned into a shrine to the victims of Stalinism.

According to one interpretation, Stalin's regime had to maintain its citizens in a state of fear and uncertainty to stay in power (Brzezinski, 1958). Robert Conquest emphasized Stalin's paranoia, focused on the Moscow show trial of \"Old Bolsheviks\", and analyzed the carefully planned and systematic destruction of the Communist Party. Some others view the Great Purge as a crucial moment, or rather the culmination, of a vast [[Social engineering (political science)|social engineering]] campaign started at the beginning of the 1930s (Hagenloh, 2000; Shearer, 2003; Werth, 2003).<ref name=werth>{{cite web|first=Nicolas|last=Werth |authorlink=Nicolas Werth|url=http://www.sciencespo.fr/mass-violence-war-massacre-resistance/en/document/nkvd-mass-secret-national-operations-august-1937-november-1938|title=Case Study:The NKVD Mass Secret Operation n\u00b0 00447 (August 1937 \u2013 November 1938)|publisher=Mass Violence and Resistance \u2013 Research Network|date=15 April 2019 }}</ref>\n\nAccording to historian James Harris, contemporary archival research pokes \"rather large holes in the traditional story\" weaved by Conquest and others.{{sfn|Harris|2017|pp=2\u20134}} His findings, while not exonerating Stalin or the Soviet state, dispel the notion that the bloodletting was merely the result of Stalin attempting to establish his own personal dictatorship; evidence suggests he was committed to building the socialist state envisioned by Lenin. The real motivation for the terror, according to Harris, was an exaggerated fear of counterrevolution.{{sfn|Harris|2017|p=16}}\n\n<blockquote>So what was the motivation behind the Terror? The answers required a lot more digging, but it gradually became clearer that the violence of the late 1930s was driven by fear. Most Bolsheviks, Stalin among them, believed that the revolutions of 1789, 1848 and 1871 had failed because their leaders hadn't adequately anticipated the ferocity of the counter-revolutionary reaction from the establishment. They were determined not to make the same mistake.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://historynewsnetwork.org/article/163498|title=Historian James Harris says Russian archives show we've misunderstood Stalin|last=Harris |first=James |date=July 26, 2016 |website=[[History News Network]]|access-date=December 1, 2018 |quote=}}</ref></blockquote>\n\nTwo major lines of interpretation have emerged among historians.  One argues that the purges reflected Stalin's ambitions, his paranoia, and his inner drive to increase his power and eliminate potential rivals. Revisionist historians explain the purges by theorizing that rival factions exploited Stalin's paranoia and used terror to enhance their own position.  Peter Whitewood examines the first purge, directed at the Army, and comes up with a third interpretation that,  Stalin and other top leaders believing that they were always surrounded by capitalist enemies, always worried about the vulnerability and loyalty of the Red Army.<ref>James Harris, \"Encircled by Enemies: Stalin\u2019s Perceptions of the Capitalist World, 1918\u20131941,\u201d ''Journal of Strategic Studies'' 30#3 [2007]: 513\u2013545.</ref> It was not a ploy \u2013 Stalin truly believed it. \u201cStalin attacked the Red Army because he seriously misperceived a serious security threat\u201d; thus \u201cStalin seems to have genuinely believed that foreign\u2010backed enemies had infiltrated the ranks and managed to organize a conspiracy at the very heart of the Red Army.\u201d  The purge hit deeply from June 1937 and November 1938, removing 35,000; many were executed. Experience in carrying out the purge facilitated purging other key elements in the wider Soviet polity.<ref>Peter Whitewood, ''The Red Army and the Great Terror: Stalin\u2019s Purge of the Soviet Military'' (2015) Quoting pp 12, 276.</ref><ref>Ronald Grigor Suny, review, ''Historian'' (2018) 80#1:177-79.</ref><ref>For a critique of Whitewood see Alexander Hill, review, ''American Historical Review'' (2017) 122#5 pp 1713-1714.</ref> Historians often cite the disruption as factors in the Red Army's disastrous military performance during the German invasion.<ref>Roger R.

They are tied as the fifth-longest cantilever bridges in the world. Each span carries four general-use automobile lanes; additionally the westbound span has two reversible [[High-occupancy vehicle|HOV]] lanes across the river.\n\nIt is the farthest downstream bridge on the Mississippi River. It is also the widest and most heavily traveled bridge on the lower Mississippi; the only other comparable bridges on the Mississippi are in the [[St. Louis]] area, those being the [[Poplar Street Bridge]], the [[Jefferson Barracks Bridge]], and the [[Stan Musial Veterans Memorial Bridge]].\n{{wide image|NewOrleansPanoramic.jpg|1000px|align-cap=center|Skyline of New Orleans Central Business District from the Mississippi River facing west with the Crescent City Connection in the foreground to the left}}\n\n==History==\nWhat later became known as the Crescent City Connection was the second bridge to span the Mississippi south of [[Baton Rouge, Louisiana|Baton Rouge]], the first being the [[Huey P. Long Bridge (Jefferson Parish)|Huey P. Long Bridge]], a few miles upriver from the city, and it is the first bridge across the river in New Orleans itself.\n\nThe Mississippi River Bridge Authority, known since 1989 as the [[Crescent City Connection Division]] (CCCD), began construction of the first span in November 1954, which opened in April 1958 as the Greater New Orleans Bridge. At its opening, the bridge was the longest cantilever bridge in the world although in terms of main span length, it was third, after the [[Forth Bridge]] and the [[Quebec Bridge]]. It carried two lanes of traffic in each direction and spurred growth in the suburban area known as the West Bank (named for its location on the western bank of the river although it is geographically southeast of New Orleans). Construction of the second span began in March 1981. Despite promises that it would be ready for the [[1984 Louisiana World Exposition]], it did not open to traffic until September 1988. The second span was originally designated as the Greater New Orleans Bridge No. 2. Both bridges were designed by [[Ralph Modjeski|Modjeski & Masters, Inc.]]. As soon as the new span was opened, the old span was temporarily closed in phases to replace the asphalt-on-steel deck with concrete. All the exits and entrances to the bridge were replaced as well.\n\nAfter the completion of the second span, a public contest was held in 1989 to rename the bridges, which was won by Jennifer Grodsky, of St. Clement of Rome School in [[Metairie, Louisiana|Metairie]], [[Louisiana]], on March 17.<ref name=\"March181999\">{{cite news |last = Marsh |first = Barri |title = Students Find a Name that Connects: Winning Class Savors Victory |location = New Orleans |work = [[The Times-Picayune]] |page = A1 |date = March 18, 1989 |url =  |access-date = }}</ref>{{Verify source|date=April 2020}} The name was selected over the second-place finisher, the Greater New Orleans Superspan, as the name for the spans.<ref name=\"March181999\"/> Other names voted on for the naming of the spans included: the Crescent City Twins, the Delta Twins, the Crescent City Bridge, the New Orleans Metro Span, the Crescent City Gateway, the Crescent City Twin Span, the Crescent City River Bridge, The Big Easy and the Li'l Easy, the Jazz City Bridge, the Big East Twin Spans, The Pelican Bridge, the Fleur-de-Lis, the Greater Mississippi River Bridge, the Unity Bridge, the Mississippi River Twins, The Friendship Connection, The Pelican Pride, the Riverview Bridge, the Creole Crossing, the Jazz Gate Bridge, the Greater New Orleans Twin Bridges, and the Crescent Bend Bridge.<ref name=\"February161989\">{{cite news |last = Atkinson |first = Paul |title = 25 Names Chosen for Bridge Contest |location = New Orleans |work = The Times-Picayune |page = A1 |date = February 16, 1989 |url =  |access-date = }}</ref>\n\nFollowing this contest, the Louisiana Legislature officially designated the bridges as the Crescent City Connection. (The bridge is commonly known among local [[Vietnamese Americans]] as {{lang|vi|C\u1ea7u Con C\u00f2}}, the \"Pelican Bridge\", due to blue signs at either end that feature a pelican from [[Flag of Louisiana|the state flag]].<ref>{{cite news|title=New Orleans, N\u1eeda N\u0103m Sau B\u00e3o Katrina|trans-title=New Orleans half a year after Hurricane Katrina|author=\u0110\u00e0o Tr\u01b0\u1eddng Ph\u00fac|location=Westminster, California|work=Vi\u1ec7t B\u00e1o Daily News|date=February 15, 2006|accessdate=August 23, 2018|url=https://vietbao.com/a45919/new-orleans-nua-nam-sau-bao-katrina|language=vi}}</ref>) Beginning in 1989, it was maintained and policed as a toll bridge by the CCCD, a special division of the Louisiana Department of Transportation and Development, although a 2013 vote removed the tolls, and the crossing is now overseen by the Louisiana Department of Public Safety. This separate state police agency used elsewhere in the state, is required because of the high traffic volume and the fact that the two spans briefly cross into Jefferson Parish and the city of Gretna, Louisiana. Since renaming of the twin bridges, some local residents refer to the bridge as \"The GNO\", in spite of the name change from decades past. Most people refer to it as the \"CCC\", whereas the proper name of \"Crescent City Connection\" is used mainly in the media.\n\nDue to the Mississippi River's winding course through the New Orleans area (the river is flowing north at the place where the two bridges cross), the bridge contains two [[wrong-way concurrency|wrong-way concurrencies]], with the ''east''bound span carrying Business US 90 ''West'', while the ''west''bound span carries Business US 90 ''East''. The Crescent City Connection was the fifth most traveled toll bridge in the United States in 2006, with annual traffic exceeding 63 million vehicles.<ref>{{cite web |url = http://www.dotd.state.la.us/operations/cccd/bridges.asp |title = CCCD Bridges |access-date = August 16, 2006 |author = Louisiana Department of Transportation and Development |publisher = Louisiana Department of Transportation and Development }}</ref>\n\nThe bridge is the centerpiece of the Crescent Connection Road Race (CCRR)<ref>{{cite web |url = http://www.ccff.org/site7.php |title = Crescent City Road Race |access-date = December 12, 2006 |author = Crescent City Fitness Foundation |publisher = Crescent City Fitness Foundation }}</ref> or Bridge Race as it is locally known, an annual event held on the first Saturday in September following Labor Day. The bridge remains open to vehicular traffic during the race, which only uses the two HOV lanes. The CCRR was originally started as a fundraiser for the bridge's decorative lights. These lights line the top profile lines of both bridges; 64 lights along each string for a total 256 lights.\n\n===Hurricane Katrina===\nAs [[Hurricane Katrina]] approached the city in August 2005, the CCCD halted toll collections on August 26 to aid in speed of evacuation of the Metro area. Two overhead signs were blown down on the older span, but no other damage occurred to either bridge. After the storm hit on August 29, 2005, much of the east bank of New Orleans flooded severely (see [[Effects of Hurricane Katrina in New Orleans]]). With all other major and minor highways out of town flooded in both directions, the CCC was the only open highway into or out of the east bank of [[Orleans Parish]]. (One other route, Leake Avenue/Old River Road, a small road along the Mississippi River levee, was initially blocked by debris but was cleared by local volunteer work). Two days after the storm passed, the Gretna police set up a roadblock on the bridge, refusing passage to evacuees.<ref name=\"Lawsuit\">{{cite news |url = http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qn4200/is_20061009/ai_n16769340 |title = Gretna Police Blocking Passage of New Orleanians Seeking Refuge |access-date = April 23, 2007 |first = Richard A |last = Webster |work = New Orleans CityBusiness |year = 2006 }}</ref>\n\nIn the initial weeks following the storm, only emergency personnel and contractors were permitted to use the bridge. The bridge reopened to traffic in mid-September as decreasing water levels on the East Bank of Orleans Parish allowed [[Interstate 10]] to reopen and residents to return, but then was temporarily closed to regular traffic again when another evacuation was declared due to [[Hurricane Rita]], with the bridge again reopening in late September. Toll collection resumed on October 10 after a six-week suspension, as the revenue was needed to maintain operations.<ref name=\"Tolls Resume\"/> Long lines at the toll booth lanes during non-rush times became common, due to a shortage of toll collectors and electronic toll tags, combined with heavy usage of the bridge due to the many New Orleanians staying with friends and relatives on the Westbank while they worked on gutting and repairing their flooded Eastbank homes.\n\n==={{Anchor|Interstate 49}}Proposed Future Interstate 49 designation===\n\nIn addition to the CCC's designation as Business US 90, the bridge, along with its approach roads, the [[Pontchartrain Expressway]] and [[Westbank Expressway]] were proposed to also serve as [[Interstate 910]]. This proposed designation was federal only and no signs identify the bridge as I-910. This is a temporary designation until [[Interstate 49]] is completed between New Orleans and [[Lafayette, Louisiana|Lafayette]], at which time the bridge will be signed as I-49. This proposed designation currently does not have funding to support all the needed infrastructure to accomplish the plan and has largely been dropped.\n\n{{Wide image|New Orleans Convention Center.jpeg|1000px|The [[New Orleans Morial Convention Center]] in front of the Crescent City Connection in 2001}}\n\n{{-}}\n\n==Tolls==\n[[Image:CrescentCityConnectionTolls16Mch07.jpg|thumb|upright=1.5|Westbank toll plaza in March 2007]]\n\nThe tolls collected on the Crescent City Connection were defined in Louisiana state law R.S. 47:820.5(B).<ref>{{cite web |url = http://www.legis.state.la.us/lss/lss.asp?doc=102576 |title = RS 47:820.5 |access-date = August 16, 2006 |publisher = State of Louisiana }}</ref> This law said that from October 1, 1994 through December 31, 2012, tolls were to be collected at a rate of $0.20 per axle for toll tag users, and $0.50 per axle for cash users.

It carried two lanes of traffic in each direction and spurred growth in the suburban area known as the West Bank (named for its location on the western bank of the river although it is geographically southeast of New Orleans). Construction of the second span began in March 1981. Despite promises that it would be ready for the [[1984 Louisiana World Exposition]], it did not open to traffic until September 1988. The second span was originally designated as the Greater New Orleans Bridge No. 2. Both bridges were designed by [[Ralph Modjeski|Modjeski & Masters, Inc.]]. As soon as the new span was opened, the old span was temporarily closed in phases to replace the asphalt-on-steel deck with concrete. All the exits and entrances to the bridge were replaced as well.\n\nAfter the completion of the second span, a public contest was held in 1989 to rename the bridges, which was won by Jennifer Grodsky, of St. Clement of Rome School in [[Metairie, Louisiana|Metairie]], [[Louisiana]], on March 17.<ref name=\"March181999\">{{cite news |last = Marsh |first = Barri |title = Students Find a Name that Connects: Winning Class Savors Victory |location = New Orleans |work = [[The Times-Picayune]] |page = A1 |date = March 18, 1989 |url =  |access-date = }}</ref>{{Verify source|date=April 2020}} The name was selected over the second-place finisher, the Greater New Orleans Superspan, as the name for the spans.<ref name=\"March181999\"/> Other names voted on for the naming of the spans included: the Crescent City Twins, the Delta Twins, the Crescent City Bridge, the New Orleans Metro Span, the Crescent City Gateway, the Crescent City Twin Span, the Crescent City River Bridge, The Big Easy and the Li'l Easy, the Jazz City Bridge, the Big East Twin Spans, The Pelican Bridge, the Fleur-de-Lis, the Greater Mississippi River Bridge, the Unity Bridge, the Mississippi River Twins, The Friendship Connection, The Pelican Pride, the Riverview Bridge, the Creole Crossing, the Jazz Gate Bridge, the Greater New Orleans Twin Bridges, and the Crescent Bend Bridge.<ref name=\"February161989\">{{cite news |last = Atkinson |first = Paul |title = 25 Names Chosen for Bridge Contest |location = New Orleans |work = The Times-Picayune |page = A1 |date = February 16, 1989 |url =  |access-date = }}</ref>\n\nFollowing this contest, the Louisiana Legislature officially designated the bridges as the Crescent City Connection. (The bridge is commonly known among local [[Vietnamese Americans]] as {{lang|vi|C\u1ea7u Con C\u00f2}}, the \"Pelican Bridge\", due to blue signs at either end that feature a pelican from [[Flag of Louisiana|the state flag]].<ref>{{cite news|title=New Orleans, N\u1eeda N\u0103m Sau B\u00e3o Katrina|trans-title=New Orleans half a year after Hurricane Katrina|author=\u0110\u00e0o Tr\u01b0\u1eddng Ph\u00fac|location=Westminster, California|work=Vi\u1ec7t B\u00e1o Daily News|date=February 15, 2006|accessdate=August 23, 2018|url=https://vietbao.com/a45919/new-orleans-nua-nam-sau-bao-katrina|language=vi}}</ref>) Beginning in 1989, it was maintained and policed as a toll bridge by the CCCD, a special division of the Louisiana Department of Transportation and Development, although a 2013 vote removed the tolls, and the crossing is now overseen by the Louisiana Department of Public Safety. This separate state police agency used elsewhere in the state, is required because of the high traffic volume and the fact that the two spans briefly cross into Jefferson Parish and the city of Gretna, Louisiana. Since renaming of the twin bridges, some local residents refer to the bridge as \"The GNO\", in spite of the name change from decades past. Most people refer to it as the \"CCC\", whereas the proper name of \"Crescent City Connection\" is used mainly in the media.\n\nDue to the Mississippi River's winding course through the New Orleans area (the river is flowing north at the place where the two bridges cross), the bridge contains two [[wrong-way concurrency|wrong-way concurrencies]], with the ''east''bound span carrying Business US 90 ''West'', while the ''west''bound span carries Business US 90 ''East''. The Crescent City Connection was the fifth most traveled toll bridge in the United States in 2006, with annual traffic exceeding 63 million vehicles.<ref>{{cite web |url = http://www.dotd.state.la.us/operations/cccd/bridges.asp |title = CCCD Bridges |access-date = August 16, 2006 |author = Louisiana Department of Transportation and Development |publisher = Louisiana Department of Transportation and Development }}</ref>\n\nThe bridge is the centerpiece of the Crescent Connection Road Race (CCRR)<ref>{{cite web |url = http://www.ccff.org/site7.php |title = Crescent City Road Race |access-date = December 12, 2006 |author = Crescent City Fitness Foundation |publisher = Crescent City Fitness Foundation }}</ref> or Bridge Race as it is locally known, an annual event held on the first Saturday in September following Labor Day. The bridge remains open to vehicular traffic during the race, which only uses the two HOV lanes. The CCRR was originally started as a fundraiser for the bridge's decorative lights. These lights line the top profile lines of both bridges; 64 lights along each string for a total 256 lights.\n\n===Hurricane Katrina===\nAs [[Hurricane Katrina]] approached the city in August 2005, the CCCD halted toll collections on August 26 to aid in speed of evacuation of the Metro area. Two overhead signs were blown down on the older span, but no other damage occurred to either bridge. After the storm hit on August 29, 2005, much of the east bank of New Orleans flooded severely (see [[Effects of Hurricane Katrina in New Orleans]]). With all other major and minor highways out of town flooded in both directions, the CCC was the only open highway into or out of the east bank of [[Orleans Parish]]. (One other route, Leake Avenue/Old River Road, a small road along the Mississippi River levee, was initially blocked by debris but was cleared by local volunteer work). Two days after the storm passed, the Gretna police set up a roadblock on the bridge, refusing passage to evacuees.<ref name=\"Lawsuit\">{{cite news |url = http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qn4200/is_20061009/ai_n16769340 |title = Gretna Police Blocking Passage of New Orleanians Seeking Refuge |access-date = April 23, 2007 |first = Richard A |last = Webster |work = New Orleans CityBusiness |year = 2006 }}</ref>\n\nIn the initial weeks following the storm, only emergency personnel and contractors were permitted to use the bridge. The bridge reopened to traffic in mid-September as decreasing water levels on the East Bank of Orleans Parish allowed [[Interstate 10]] to reopen and residents to return, but then was temporarily closed to regular traffic again when another evacuation was declared due to [[Hurricane Rita]], with the bridge again reopening in late September. Toll collection resumed on October 10 after a six-week suspension, as the revenue was needed to maintain operations.<ref name=\"Tolls Resume\"/> Long lines at the toll booth lanes during non-rush times became common, due to a shortage of toll collectors and electronic toll tags, combined with heavy usage of the bridge due to the many New Orleanians staying with friends and relatives on the Westbank while they worked on gutting and repairing their flooded Eastbank homes.\n\n==={{Anchor|Interstate 49}}Proposed Future Interstate 49 designation===\n\nIn addition to the CCC's designation as Business US 90, the bridge, along with its approach roads, the [[Pontchartrain Expressway]] and [[Westbank Expressway]] were proposed to also serve as [[Interstate 910]]. This proposed designation was federal only and no signs identify the bridge as I-910. This is a temporary designation until [[Interstate 49]] is completed between New Orleans and [[Lafayette, Louisiana|Lafayette]], at which time the bridge will be signed as I-49. This proposed designation currently does not have funding to support all the needed infrastructure to accomplish the plan and has largely been dropped.\n\n{{Wide image|New Orleans Convention Center.jpeg|1000px|The [[New Orleans Morial Convention Center]] in front of the Crescent City Connection in 2001}}\n\n{{-}}\n\n==Tolls==\n[[Image:CrescentCityConnectionTolls16Mch07.jpg|thumb|upright=1.5|Westbank toll plaza in March 2007]]\n\nThe tolls collected on the Crescent City Connection were defined in Louisiana state law R.S. 47:820.5(B).<ref>{{cite web |url = http://www.legis.state.la.us/lss/lss.asp?doc=102576 |title = RS 47:820.5 |access-date = August 16, 2006 |publisher = State of Louisiana }}</ref> This law said that from October 1, 1994 through December 31, 2012, tolls were to be collected at a rate of $0.20 per axle for toll tag users, and $0.50 per axle for cash users.

Every year, there are a few cases of malaria reported in the UK, but these do not lead to sustained transmission in the population due to the lack of a suitable [[Vector (epidemiology)|vector]] (mosquitoes of the genus ''[[Anopheles]]''). While it might be common to say that [[AIDS]] is \"endemic\" in many [[Africa|African]] countries, meaning found in an area, this is a use of the word in its etymological, rather than epidemiological, form. [[AIDS_in_Africa|AIDS cases in Africa]] are increasing, so the disease is not in an endemic steady state. The spread of AIDS in Africa could be correctly called an [[epidemic]], however.<ref>{{cite web|title=HIV and AIDS in East and Southern Africa regional overview|url=https://www.avert.org/professionals/hiv-around-world/sub-saharan-africa/overview|website=AVERT|language=en|date=20 July 2015}}</ref>\n\nFor an infection that relies on person-to-person transmission to be endemic, each person who becomes infected with the disease must pass it on to one other person on average. Assuming a completely susceptible population, that means that the [[basic reproduction number]] (R<sub>0</sub>) of the infection must equal 1. In a population with some [[immune system|immune]] individuals, the basic reproduction number multiplied by the proportion of [[Susceptible individual|susceptible]] individuals in the population (''S'') must be 1.

The first film, ''Psycho'', was directed by filmmaker [[Alfred Hitchcock]].<ref>http://www.thepsychomovies.com/movies/psycho/</ref> Subsequently, another film related to the series was made: an [[Hitchcock (film)|Alfred Hitchcock biopic]] based on the book ''[[Alfred Hitchcock and the Making of Psycho]]''. Also, an independent documentary called ''[[The Psycho Legacy]]'' was released on October 19, 2010. It mostly focused on ''Psycho II'', ''Psycho III'' and ''Psycho IV: The Beginning'', but did cover the impact and legacy of the original film. \n\nA five-season TV series, ''[[Bates Motel (TV series)|Bates Motel]]'', aired on [[A&E (TV channel)|A&E]] between 2013 and 2017. In a modern-day setting, it is an imagining of the Norman and (at first, a living) Norma Bates characters, and their unusual relationship. It stars [[Freddie Highmore]] as teenaged Norman and [[Vera Farmiga]] as mother Norma.\n\nThe films focus on the life of [[Norman Bates]], a deeply disturbed young man who operates the Bates Motel. He is mentally unstable from a domineering relationship with his mother, which results in him having a psychotic twisted personality and, as a result, he occasionally kills people.\n\n==Novels==\n{{unsourced section|date=August 2016}}\n===''Psycho'' (1959)===\n{{Main|Psycho (novel)}}\nIn 1959, the novel ''Psycho'' was published. It was loosely based on the Wisconsin serial killer and cannibal [[Ed Gein]]. Author [[Robert Bloch]] lived 40 miles away from Gein's farmhouse and liked the idea of somebody being able to kill people in a small community and get away with it for years without being caught. The character of [[Norman Bates]] was very different in the novel from in [[Psycho (1960 film)|the film version]]. In the novel, Bates is overweight, in his early 40s and drinks heavily. When [[Joseph Stefano]] adapted the novel into the screenplay, he made the character of Norman young, attractive and vulnerable.\n\n===''Psycho II'' (1982)===\n{{Main|Psycho II (novel)}}\nIn 1982, Bloch wrote a sequel novel called ''Psycho II'' which had nothing to do with the [[Psycho II (film)|1983 film version]]. In the novel, Norman Bates escapes the mental institution and goes to Hollywood to stop the production of a film based on his life. Many critics and fans described the novel as being silly and weird and couldn't have possibly been made into a film.\n\n===''Psycho House'' (1990)===\n{{Main|Psycho House}}\nIn 1990, due to the pressure from his publishing company, Bloch wrote a third novel called ''Psycho House''. However, according to horror writer [[David J. Schow]], when writing it Bloch originally called it ''Psycho 13''. In the novel, ten years after Norman Bates' death, the Bates mansion and motel are bought as [[tourist attraction]]s and a series of murders begin to take place.\n\n==Films==\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center;\"\n|-\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Occupation\n! colspan=\"6\" | Film title\n|-\n!

While en route to Sam's [[California]] home, she parks along the road to sleep. A highway patrol officer awakens her and, suspicious of her agitation, follows her. When she trades her car for another at a dealership, he notes the new vehicle's details. Marion returns to the road but, rather than drive in a heavy storm, decides to spend the night at the Bates Motel.  The proprietor, [[Norman Bates]] ([[Anthony Perkins]]), tells Marion he rarely has customers because of the motel's disconnection from a new [[Interstate highway system|Interstate]] and mentions he lives with [[Norma Bates (Psycho)|his mother]] in the house overlooking the motel. He invites Marion to supper. She overhears Norman arguing with his mother about letting Marion in the house, and during the meal, she angers him by suggesting he institutionalize his mother. He admits he would like this, but does not want to abandon her.\n\nMarion resolves to return to Phoenix to return the money. After calculating how she can repay the money she has spent, Marion dumps her notes down the toilet and begins to shower. An anonymous female figure enters the bathroom and stabs her to death. Finding the corpse, Norman is horrified. He places Marion's body, wrapped in the shower curtain, and all her possessions &mdash; including the money &mdash; in the trunk of her car and sinks it in a nearby swamp.\n\nShortly afterward, Sam is contacted by both Marion's sister [[Lila Crane]] ([[Vera Miles]]) and private detective Milton Arbogast ([[Martin Balsam]]), who has been hired by Marion's employer to recover the money. Arbogast traces Marion to the motel and questions Norman, who unconvincingly lies that Marion stayed for one night and left the following morning. He refuses to let Arbogast talk to his mother, claiming she is ill. Arbogast calls Lila to update her and tells her he will call again after he questions Norman's mother.\n\nArbogast enters Norman's house and at the top of the stairs is attacked by a figure who slashes his face with a knife, pushes him down the stairs, then stabs him to death. When Arbogast does not call Lila, she and Sam contact the local police. Deputy Sheriff Al Chambers ([[John McIntire]]) is perplexed to learn Arbogast saw a woman in a window since Norman's mother died ten years ago. Norman confronts his mother and urges her to hide in the cellar. She rejects the idea and orders him out of her room, but against her will, Norman carries her to the cellar.\n\nPosing as a married couple, Sam and Lila check into the motel and search Marion's room, where they find a scrap of paper in the toilet with \"$40,000\" written on it. While Sam distracts Norman, Lila sneaks into the house. Sam suggests to Norman that he killed Marion for the money so he could buy a new hotel. Realizing Lila is not around, Norman knocks Sam unconscious and rushes to the house. Lila sees him and hides in the cellar where she discovers the semi-preserved and [[mummy|mummified]] body of Norman's mother. Wearing his mother's clothes and a wig and carrying a knife, Norman enters and tries to attack Lila, but she is rescued by Sam.\n\nAfter Norman's arrest, [[forensic psychiatry|forensic psychiatrist]] Dr. Richmond ([[Simon Oakland]]) tells Sam and Lila that Norman's dead mother is living in Norman's [[Psyche (psychology)|psyche]] as an [[dissociative identity disorder|alternate personality]]. After the death of Norman's father, the pair lived as if they were the only people in the world. When his mother found a lover, Norman went mad with jealousy and murdered them both. Consumed with guilt, Norman \"erased the crime\" by bringing his mother back to life in his mind. He stole her corpse and preserved the body. When he was \"Mother\", he acted, talked, and dressed as she would. The psychiatrist concludes that the \"Mother\" personality now has complete control of Norman's mind.\n\nIn the final scene, Norman sits in a cell, thinking in \"Mother's\" voice. In a voiceover, \"Mother\" explains that she plans to prove that she is incapable of violence by refusing to swat a fly that has landed on her hand. The final shot shows Marion's car being recovered from the swamp.\n\n===''Psycho II'' (1983)===\n{{Main|Psycho II (film)}}\n[[Norman Bates]] ([[Anthony Perkins]]) is released from a mental institution after 22 years. [[Lila Crane|Lila Loomis]] ([[Vera Miles]]), the sister of Bates' victim [[Marion Crane]] and widow of the now-deceased Sam Loomis, vehemently protests with a petition that she has been circulating with signatures of 743 people, including the relatives of the six people Norman killed prior to his incarceration, but her plea is dismissed. Norman is taken to his old home, the Bates Motel, with the house behind it on the hill, by Dr. Bill Raymond ([[Robert Loggia]]), who assures him everything will be fine. He is introduced to the motel's new manager, Warren Toomey ([[Dennis Franz]]). The following day, Norman reports to a pre-arranged job at a nearby diner, run by a kindly old lady named [[Emma Spool]] ([[Claudia Bryar]]). One of his co-workers there is Mary Loomis ([[Meg Tilly]]), a young waitress. Mary claims she has been thrown out of her boyfriend's place and needs a place to stay. Norman offers to let her stay at the motel, then extends the offer to his home when he discovers that Toomey has turned his beloved establishment into a sleazy adult motel.\n\nNorman's adjustment back into society appears to be going along well until \"Mother\" begins to make her presence known. Norman gets mysterious notes from \"Mother\" at the house and diner. Phone calls come from someone claiming to be Norman's mother. Toomey picks a fight at the diner after Norman fires him. Later, a figure in a black dress stabs Toomey to death with a kitchen knife as he is packing to leave the motel. Norman begins to doubt his sanity when he begins hearing voices in the house. He enters his mother's bedroom to find it looks exactly as it did 22 years ago. A sound lures him to the attic, where he is locked in. Believing the house to be abandoned, a teenage couple sneaks in through the cellar window. They notice a female figure pacing in the next room. As they try to climb out, the boy is stabbed to death. The girl escapes and alerts the police. Mary eventually finds Norman in the attic. Sheriff Hunt ([[Hugh Gillin]]) questions them about the boy's murder. He finds the cellar neat and orderly. Norman is about to admit that something suspicious is going on, but Mary claims that she has cleaned up the basement herself. After the sheriff leaves, Norman asks Mary why she lied. She explains that she had to save him from being arrested. Norman collapses into the chair with his head in his hands and moans, \"It's starting again!\"\n\nMary is startled later when she discovers someone looking at her through a peephole in the bathroom wall. She calls out to Norman, who is downstairs and out of reach. The two are horrified to find a bloody cloth that has been stuffed down the toilet. Norman appears confused and believes he may have committed another murder. Mary goes down to check the motel. In the parlor she is surprised by Lila, who reveals herself to be Mary's mother. She has been calling Norman claiming to be his mother, even going so far as to dress up as her and allowing him to see her in the window. Mary has been helping her. She was responsible for restoring Mother's room at the house and locking Norman in the attic. All of this was an attempt to drive Norman insane again and have him recommitted.\n\nMary's growing feelings for Norman, however, have been preying on her conscience leaving her to reconsider her actions. Meanwhile, Dr. Raymond discovers Mary's identity as Lila's daughter and informs Norman. He also orders the corpse of Norma Bates (which was buried in a proper grave after the events of the original film) to be exhumed, to prove that Norman isn't being haunted by his mother. Mary admits to Norman that she has been part of Lila's ruse, and that while she now refuses to continue, Lila won't stop. Mary goes to Lila's hotel and their argument is overheard by a bartender. Later, Lila drives over to Norman's house, unaware that Dr. Raymond is watching her from the Bates Motel as she sneaks into the cellar. While removing her \"Mother\" costume from a loose stone in the floor, another figure dressed as \"Mother\" steps out of the shadows and murders her. Dr. Raymond runs up to the house. Lila's body is not in the cellar.\n\nMeanwhile, Mary discovers that a car has been retrieved from the swamp, with Toomey's body in the trunk. Realizing the police will shortly arrive to arrest Norman, Mary returns to warn him. The phone rings in the house, Norman answers, and starts speaking to his \"mother\". Mary listens in and discovers that nobody is on the line with Norman. Terrified, Mary runs downstairs into the cellar, and quickly dresses up as Mother to confront Norman. Someone grabs her from behind, and she plunges the butcher knife into ... Dr. Raymond, who has sneaked back into the house. A stunned Mary runs downstairs and is confronted by a deranged Norman, who promises to cover up for \"Mother\". Mary tries to keep him away, repeatedly stabbing him in the hands and chest. He backs Mary into the fruit cellar to hide and slips on a pile of coal, which avalanches away from the wall, revealing Lila's body hidden behind it. Mary is now convinced that Norman had been committing the murders. She raises her knife to stab him and is shot to death by the incoming police. The sheriff inaccurately believes Lila and Mary committed all the murders.\n\nThat evening, a woman walks up the steps to the Bates' mansion. Bandaged from his injuries, Norman has set a place for dinner when he hears a knock at the door. It is Emma Spool, the kindly woman from the diner. Norman gives her a cup of tea. Mrs. Spool tells him that she is his real mother, that Mrs. Bates was her sister, who adopted Norman as an infant while Mrs. Spool was institutionalized. She further reveals that she was the murderer, having killed anybody who tried to harm her son. As she sips the tea, Norman kills her with a sudden blow to the head with a shovel. Norman is now completely insane again. He carries Mrs. Spool's body upstairs to Mother's room and we hear Mother's voice warn Norman not to play with \"filthy girls\". Norman reopens the Bates Motel and stands in front of the house, waiting for new customers as Mother watches from the window upstairs.\n\n===''Psycho III'' (1986)===\n{{Main|Psycho III}}\nMaureen Coyle ([[Diana Scarwid]]), a mentally unstable young nun, is on top of a bell tower about to commit suicide. When another nun tries to get her to come down, Maureen accidentally pushes her over the railing to her death. Another nun tells Maureen that she will burn in hell. She is forced to leave the convent after this ordeal.\n\n[[Norman Bates]] ([[Anthony Perkins]]) is still manning the desk at the Bates Motel and living with the preserved corpse of his real mother, [[Emma Spool]] ([[Claudia Bryar]]), whom Norman killed at the end of ''Psycho II''. Local law enforcement and Norman's ex-boss Ralph Statler ([[Robert Alan Browne]]) are concerned since Mrs. Spool has been missing for over a month. Duane Duke ([[Jeff Fahey]]), a sleazy musician desperate for money, is offered the job of assistant manager at the Bates Motel. Maureen, now the new long-term tenant, has some issues to resolve in her life. She gave up her vows as a nun only days before, and she isn't sure just how she feels about either spiritual or earthly matters.\n\nSheriff John Hunt ([[Hugh Gillin]]) and Statler have a conversation at the diner, when Tracy Venable ([[Roberta Maxwell]]), a pushy journalist from Los Angeles, interrupts them. She is working on an article about serial killers being put back on the streets. Venable is trying to back up her theory that Norman is back to his old ways again. Norman appears and Venable jumps at the chance to talk with him. Unaware of her ulterior motives Norman opens up to her, but is distracted when an exhausted Maureen enters and sits at the lunch counter. He is startled by Maureen's presence, because he feels she strongly resembles [[Marion Crane]] ([[Janet Leigh]]). Seeing the initials \"M.C.\" on her suitcase, Norman freaks out and leaves the diner. After a conversation with \"Mother\", Norman spies on Maureen as she undresses and heads into the bathroom to take a shower. Keeping \"her\" word, \"Mother\" enters Maureen's motel room with plans to kill her. Upon pulling back the shower curtain, it is revealed Maureen has attempted suicide by cutting her wrists, a sight which snaps Norman back to his \"normal\" side. Maureen looks up at \"Mother\" who is so weakened by what \"she\" sees, \"she\" lowers the knife. Due to blood loss, Maureen hallucinates and she mistakes Norman, dressed up as \"Mother\", for the [[Mary, mother of Jesus|Virgin Mary]] holding a silver crucifix.\n\nMeanwhile, Tracy has met with Duane at a bar where they discuss Norman, and it seems Tracy blames Norman for Mrs. Spool's disappearance. When she leaves, Duane picks up another girl at the bar, Red ([[Juliette Cummins]]). Norman gets Maureen to the local hospital to save her life. After she is released, he invites her to stay back at the motel and they begin a romantic relationship. The same night, Duane and Red arrive at the motel and hear an argument between \"Mother\" and Norman, but think it's just a TV turned up too loud. Red and Duane, head to cabin 12 where they make love. Later that night, Red, makes it clear she wants more than just a fling. Calling him a pig, they argue. Duane, infuriated, throws her out of the cabin. Red heads down to the payphone to call a cab, where she realizes she is wearing her blouse backwards. As she takes it off to put it on the right way, \"Mother\" shatters the phone booth door and stabs a trapped Red to death. The next morning, Duane finds Norman scrubbing down the phone booth.\n\nA group from out of town arrive at the motel where they plan to watch the local [[American football|football]] game. Tracy comes to find Norman and ask questions about his past and \"Mother\". Norman becomes defensive with the reporter and tells her to leave, never to return. Later that night, he and Maureen go to a restaurant, where they dance and talk romantically, while Tracy searches Mrs. Spool's apartment. She discovers the Bates Motel's telephone number written on a magazine cover. Norman and Maureen return to the motel to find most of the other guests engaged in drunken stupor. Norman goes with Maureen to her room and they fall asleep in each other's arms having refused to make love. Some time afterwards, Patsy Boyle (Katt Shea Ruben), the only sober guest, wakes up Maureen to ensure her safety as Norman had left the door open, a bad idea with all the drunken guests around. Patsy, needing to use the bathroom, finds the one in Norman's parlor unoccupied, but \"Mother\" again emerges and slashes her throat. Norman (an homage to the reaction of finding Marion dead in the shower in the original ''[[Psycho (1960 film)|Psycho]]'') gasps when he discovers Patsy's body. He buries her in the motel's ice chest outside the office.\n\nThe next morning, Sheriff Hunt and Deputy Leo appear at Norman's house to investigate Patsy's disappearance. Norman tries to prevent Hunt from entering his mother's bedroom, when he discovers that \"Mother\"/Mrs. Spool has disappeared completely. Outside, Tracy tells Maureen about Norman, and she, rather upset, leaves the motel and goes to stay with Father Brian (Gary Bayer), who took care of her at the hospital. Meanwhile, Tracy is convinced Norman is behind the latest disappearances. Norman searches for his mother all over the house and finds a note from her stating that she is in cabin 12. When Norman arrives at the cabin, he learns it was Duane who took \"Mother\". Duane confronts him then attempts to blackmail Norman into paying him off, or he'll turn Norman into the police. He tells Duane he doesn't have that kind of money, but Duane reminds him that Norman has made a lot of cash from his business, and if Norman doesn't give money for his silence, he will go to the police. He agrees to Duane's blackmail demands, but he then unexpectedly throws an ashtray at Duane's head. They fight and Norman seemingly kills Duane by hitting him several times with his own guitar. Terrified of what he has done, he blames \"Mother\" for this.\n\nTracy talks to Statler and Myrna ([[Lee Garlington]]) about Mrs. Spool and discovers she was working at the diner before Statler bought it from Harvey Leach. Tracy meets with Leach, a resident at an assisted living facility, and is informed that Mrs. Spool had also once been institutionalized for murder. Meanwhile, Norman drives Duane's car to the swamp with Duane and Patsy's bodies in it. Duane turns out to be alive and attacks Norman, who accidentally drives the car into the swamp. He struggles out of the car while Duane drowns. Tracy reads some old newspapers at her study and discovers about the \"Bates kidnapping\".\n\nMaureen convinces herself that Norman is her true love. She returns to the motel and takes a shower before visiting Norman at his house. They share a tender moment at the top of the staircase when \"Mother\" shouts furiously at Norman, which startles him and causes him to lose grip on Maureen's hands. She falls down the stairs into the Cupid statue at the base of the stairs. She goes limp and sinks to the floor revealing the arrow had punctured her skull. Distraught, Norman screams and confronts his mother, saying that he will get her for this. \"You don't have the guts, boy!\" declares \"Mother\".\n\nAt that moment, Tracy arrives at the motel and tries to find Maureen. She enters the house only to find her lying dead on the couch of the living room which is filled with lit candles. Then she sees Norman dressed as \"Mother\", holding a knife, and tries to flee. She tries to reason with Norman by explaining his family history: Emma Spool, who ''was'' in fact his aunt, was in love with Norman's father, but he married her sister, Norma, instead. Mrs. Spool, having serious psychological problems, kidnapped Norman when he was a baby after she killed Mr. Bates, believing Norman was the child \"she should have had with him.\" She discovers Mrs. Spool's corpse in the bedroom, and Norman takes off his mother's dress. \"Mother\" orders him to kill Tracy, and when Norman raises the knife, he instead brutally attacks \"Mother,\" dismembering her preserved remains. The last scene shows Sheriff Hunt taking Norman to his squad car, with Father Brian and Tracy following behind. Hunt informs Norman that they may never let him out of the institution again, Norman replies, \"But I'll be free... I'll finally be free.\" Norman, sitting silently in the back of the squad car on the way to the institution, enjoys his victory over his mother by caressing a trophy: the severed hand of Mrs. Spool. He smiles sardonically as the screen fades to black and the credits roll.\n\n===''Bates Motel'' (1987)===\n{{main|Bates Motel (film)}}\nAlex West ([[Bud Cort]]) is a mentally disturbed youth who was admitted to an asylum after killing his abusive stepfather. At the asylum, he roomed with [[Norman Bates]] ([[Kurt Paul]]) and they eventually became close friends. Years later, Norman dies and Alex learns that he has inherited the Bates Motel. He travels to Norman's California hometown (renamed Fairville for this film; in the original film it was Fairvale) and with a little help from teenage runaway Willy ([[Lori Petty]]) and local handyman Henry Watson ([[Moses Gunn]]), Alex struggles to re-open the motel for business, until rumors about the place being haunted by the ghost of Norman's mother, Mrs. Bates, are apparently true. Only to find that the haunting was a prank and the ghost was the bank manager, Tom Fuller ([[Gregg Henry]]), who refused to give Alex a loan by trying to scare him away. Tom is then forced to help Alex and the others with renovating the motel or face prison for fraud. The motel was soon finished with the renovation.\n\nMeanwhile, Barbara Peters ([[Kerrie Keane]]) runs away from home and ends up staying in Alex's motel for the night, contemplating suicide for getting older, going through three divorces, and not having children. Barbara meets a teenage girl ([[Khrystyne Haje]]), who invites Barbara to dance at an after prom party in the motel with her and her teenage friends, including Tony Scotti ([[Jason Bateman]]), though Barbara felt uncomfortable hanging with young kids. It is then revealed that Barbara's real name is Sally, and that the teenage girl is her younger self from an alternate dimension who took her own life and is now trapped in \"the other side\", along with Tony, and other teens who also committed suicide. Sally tells Barbara that she has a life worth living for, then Sally leaves with the rest of the group. Barbara leaves the motel the next day, planning to live her life to the fullest. Alex looks at the screen telling viewers, \"If you ever need a room, come by. I can't say for sure what you'll find, but it is what makes the world go around.\"\n\n===''Psycho IV: The Beginning'' (1990)===\n{{Main|Psycho IV: The Beginning}}\nFran Ambrose ([[CCH Pounder]]) is a radio talk show host who is talking on the topic of \"matricide\" (when children kill their mothers) with guest Dr. Richmond ([[Warren Frost]]), who was [[Norman Bates]]' former psychologist. The radio receives a call from Norman Bates ([[Anthony Perkins]]), who has re-entered society and married his former psychiatrist, Connie (Donna Mitchell). Under the alias of \"Ed\" (possibly a reference to Ed Gein, the killer after whom the character of Norman was modeled), Norman tells his story, which the audience sees as a series of flashbacks set in the 1940s and 1950s. Some flashbacks are [[Reverse chronology|slightly out of order]]. The chronological story is: In 1950, Norman's mother, [[Norma Bates (Psycho)|Norma Bates]] ([[Olivia Hussey]]) had schizophrenia (see ''[[Psycho II (film)|Psycho II]]''); she was smothering Norman and would have violent mood swings. Due to Norman's sexual repression at her hands, when she was frolicking with him he had an incestuous erection, causing her to dress him in women's clothing and taunt him by calling him \"Norma.\" She then got engaged to a man named Chet Rudolph (Thomas Schuster), who would beat up Norman. Eventually Norman got fed up with her allowing Chet to be in their lives and poisoned them both, albeit reluctantly. He then developed his infamous multiple personality disorder and stole her corpse to create the illusion that she was alive - whenever her corpse spoke to him, the \"Norma\" personality would take over. This caused Norman as \"Norma\" to kill two women who wanted to have sex with him.\n\nThroughout the spaces in the flashbacks, Dr. Richmond realizes \"Ed\" is Norman and tries to convince Fran to trace the calls. Richmond's worries are dismissed because they cannot trace the call and they believe they can talk Norman out of the reason he called: he fears he will kill again. He tells Fran that Connie got pregnant against his wishes and that he does not want another \"monster\". He then tells Fran he does believe his mother is dead, but he will kill Connie \"with my own hands, just like the first time\". He then takes Connie to his mother's house and attempts to kill her, but after Connie reassures Norman that their child will not be a monster, he drops his knife in shame and Connie forgives him. He then burns the house where all his unhappiness began. As he tries to escape the flames, he hallucinates that he sees his victims, Chet, his mother and eventually himself preserving her corpse. He and Connie leave the scene with Norman stating, \"I'm free.\"  However, as the credits roll, the sound of his newborn baby crying can be heard.\n\n===''Psycho'' (1998)===\n{{Main|Psycho (1998 film)}}\nIn need of money to get her boyfriend Sam Loomis ([[Viggo Mortensen]]) out of debt, [[Marion Crane]] ([[Anne Heche]]) steals $400,000 from her employer and flees [[Phoenix, Arizona]] by car. While en route to Sam's [[California]] home, she parks along the road to sleep. A highway patrol officer awakens her and, suspicious of her agitated state, begins to follow her. When she trades her car for another one at a dealership, he notes the new vehicle's details. Marion returns to the road but, rather than drive in a heavy storm, decides to spend the night at the Bates Motel.  The proprietor, [[Norman Bates]] ([[Vince Vaughn]]), tells Marion he rarely has customers because of a new interstate nearby and mentions he lives with his mother in the house overlooking the motel. He invites Marion to have supper with him. She overhears Norman arguing with his mother about letting Marion in the house, and during the meal she angers him by suggesting he institutionalize his mother. He admits he would like to do so, but does not want to abandon her.\n\nMarion resolves to return to Phoenix to return the money. After calculating how she can repay the money she has spent, Marion dumps her notes down the toilet and begins to shower. An anonymous female figure enters the bathroom and stabs her to death. Finding the corpse, Norman is horrified. He cleans the bathroom and places Marion's body, wrapped in the shower curtain, and all her possessions &mdash; including the money &mdash; in the trunk of her car and sinks it in a nearby swamp...\n\nShortly afterward, Sam is contacted by both Marion's sister [[Lila Crane]] ([[Julianne Moore]]) and private detective Milton Arbogast ([[William H. Macy]]), who has been hired by Marion's employer to find her and recover the money. Arbogast traces Marion to the motel and questions Norman, who unconvincingly lies that Marion stayed for one night and left the following morning. He refuses to let Arbogast talk to his mother, claiming she is ill. Arbogast calls Lila to update her and tells her he will contact her again within an hour after he questions Norman's mother.\n\nArbogast enters Norman's house and at the top of the stairs is attacked by a figure who slashes his face three times with a knife, pushes him down the stairs, then stabs him to death. When Arbogast does not call Lila, she and Sam contact the local police. Deputy Sheriff Al Chambers ([[Philip Baker Hall]]) is perplexed to learn Arbogast saw a woman in a window, since Norman's mother died ten years ago. Norman confronts his mother and urges her to hide in the cellar. She rejects the idea and orders him out of her room, but against her will Norman carries her to the cellar.\n\nPosing as a married couple, Sam and Lila check into the motel and search Marion's room, where they find a scrap of paper in the toilet with \"$400,000\" written on it. While Sam distracts Norman, Lila sneaks into the house to search for his mother. Sam suggests to Norman that he killed Marion for the money so he could buy a new motel. Realizing Lila is not around, Norman knocks Sam unconscious with a golf club and rushes to the house. Lila sees him and hides in the cellar where she discovers the semi-preserved and [[mummy|mummified]] body of Norman's mother. Wearing his mother's clothes and a wig and carrying a knife, Norman enters and tries to attack Lila, but she is rescued by Sam.\n\nAfter Norman's arrest, [[forensic psychiatry|forensic psychiatrist]] Dr. Fred Richmond ([[Robert Forster]]) tells Sam and Lila that Norman's dead mother is living in Norman's [[Psyche (psychology)|psyche]] as an [[dissociative identity disorder|alternate personality]]. After the death of Norman's father, the pair lived as if they were the only people in the world. When his mother found a lover, Norman went over the edge with jealousy and murdered both of them. Consumed with guilt, he tried to \"erase the crime\" by bringing his mother back to life in his mind. He stole her corpse and preserved the body. When he is \"Mother\", he acts, talks, and dresses as she would. Norman imagined his mother would be as jealous of a woman to whom he might be attracted just as he was of his mother's lover, and so \"Mother\" kills any woman he has feelings for; when Norman regains consciousness, he believes that his mother has committed the crime, and covers up for her. It is implied that Norman is responsible for the unsolved disappearances of two young girls. Richmond concludes that the \"Mother\" personality has now taken complete control of Norman's mind.\n\nIn the final scene, Norman sits in a cell, thinking in \"Mother's\" voice. In a voiceover, \"Mother\" explains that she plans to prove to the authorities she is incapable of violence by refusing to swat a fly that has landed on her hand. The final shot shows Marion's car being recovered from the swamp, and then goes to end credits.\n\n==Television==\n{| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align: center\"\n|-\n! scope=\"col\" |Series\n! scope=\"col\" |Season\n! scope=\"col\" |Episodes\n! scope=\"col\" |First released\n! scope=\"col\" |Last released\n! scope=\"col\" |Showrunner(s)\n! scope=\"col\" |Network(s)\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | ''[[Bates Motel (TV series)|Bates Motel]]''\n| 5\n| 50\n| March 18, 2013 \n| April 24, 2017\n| TBA\n| [[A&E (TV channel)|A&E]]\n|-\n|}\n\n===''Bates Motel'' (2013\u20132017)===\n{{Main|Bates Motel (TV series)}}\nOn January 23, 2012, A&E announced that a television series called ''Bates Motel'' was in development at the network.

Both had deceased, domineering mothers, and had sealed off one room of their house as a shrine to their mother, and both dressed in women's clothing. However, there are many differences between Bates and Ed Gein. Among others, Gein would not be strictly considered a serial killer, having officially killed \"only\" two people.<ref>{{Harvnb|Reavill|2007|p=228}} \"With only two confirmed kills, Ed did not technically qualify as a serial killer (the traditional minimum requirement was three\"</ref> [[Peggy Robertson]], Hitchcock's production assistant, read [[Anthony Boucher]]'s positive review of the Bloch novel and decided to show the book to Hitchcock, even though readers at Hitchcock's home studio [[Paramount Pictures]] rejected its premise for a film. Hitchcock acquired rights to the novel for $9,500.<ref name=\"Leigh6\">Leigh, p. 6</ref> He reportedly ordered Robertson to buy up copies to keep the novel's surprises for the film.<ref>{{Harvnb|Rebello|1990|pp=19\u201320}}</ref> Hitchcock chose to film ''Psycho'' to recover from two aborted projects with Paramount: ''Flamingo Feather'' and ''No Bail for the Judge''. Hitchcock also faced genre competitors whose works were critically compared to his own and so wanted to film new material. The director also disliked stars' salary demands and trusted only a few people to choose prospective material, including Robertson.<ref>{{Harvnb|Rebello|1990|pp=18\u201319}}</ref>\n\nParamount executives did not want to produce the film and refused to provide the budget that Hitchcock received from them for previous films with the studio.<ref name=\"Rebello23\">{{Harvnb|Rebello|1990|p=23}}</ref> Hitchcock decided to plan for ''Psycho'' to be filmed quickly and inexpensively, similar to an episode of his ongoing television series ''[[Alfred Hitchcock Presents]]'', and hired the television series crew as Shamley Productions. He proposed this cost-conscious approach to Paramount but executives again refused to finance the film, telling him their sound stages were occupied or booked even though production was known to be in a slump. Hitchcock countered with the offer to finance the film personally and to film it at Universal-International if Paramount would distribute. He also deferred his director's fee of $250,000 for a 60% ownership of the film negative. This offer was finally accepted. Hitchcock also experienced resistance from producer Herbert Coleman and Shamley Productions executive [[Joan Harrison (screenwriter)|Joan Harrison]], who did not think the film would be a success.<ref>{{Harvnb|Rebello|1990|pp=26\u201329}}</ref>\n\nHitchcock hired writer James Cavanaugh to write a draft of the screenplay. Unsatisfied with Cavanaugh's screenplay, Hitchcock then hired up-and-coming writer [[Joseph Stefano]] to adapt the novel. The film began shooting in December 1959 and would go on to last about a month. It was filmed mostly on the backlot of Universal and in various sound stages. During shooting, Hitchcock was forced to uncharacteristically do retakes for some scenes. The final shot in the shower scene, which starts with an extreme close-up on Marion's eye and pulls up and out, proved very difficult for Leigh, since the water splashing in her face made her want to blink, and the cameraman had trouble as well since he had to manually focus while moving the camera. Retakes were also required for the opening scene, since Hitchcock felt that Leigh and Gavin were not passionate enough.<ref>Leigh, p. 55</ref> Leigh had trouble saying \"Not inordinately\" for the real estate office scene, requiring additional retakes.<ref>Leigh, p. 59</ref> Lastly, the scene in which the mother is discovered required complicated coordination of the chair turning around, Miles hitting the light bulb, and a [[lens flare]], which proved to be the sticking point. Hitchcock forced retakes until all three elements were to his satisfaction.<ref>Leigh, pp. 87\u201388</ref> The famous shower scene took a week to complete and took up a third of Janet Leigh's shooting time. ''Psycho'' was released on June 16, 1960 to mixed critical reception and financial success, making thirty-two million dollars in its theatrical run. The film received four Academy Award nominations.\n\nIn 1982, author Robert Bloch published his novel ''Psycho II'', which satirized Hollywood slasher films. Upset by this, Universal decided to make their own version that differed from Bloch's work.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://mgpfeff.home.sprynet.com/leming_interview1.html | title=Interviews - From ''Psycho'' to ''Asylum'': The Horror Films of Robert Bloch | work=The Unofficial Robert Bloch Website | accessdate=2009-08-15}}</ref> Originally, the film was intended as a [[TV movie|made-for-cable]] production.<ref name=boys>[http://retroslashers.net/blog/a-boys-best-friend-pt2-psycho-2-1983/ A Boy's Best Friend - Psycho 2 - Retroslashers.net] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20130112034832/http://retroslashers.net/blog/a-boys-best-friend-pt2-psycho-2-1983/ |date=2013-01-12 }}</ref> [[Anthony Perkins]] originally turned down the offer to reprise the role of [[Norman Bates]], but when the studio became interested in others (including [[Christopher Walken]]), Perkins quickly accepted.<ref name=film>[http://www.film.com/movies/psycho-ii/story/erics-time-capsule-psycho-ii/28477842 Eric's Time Capsule: Psycho II (June 3, 1983) - Film.com]</ref> The studio also wanted [[Jamie Lee Curtis]] (daughter of ''Psycho'' star [[Janet Leigh]]) to play the role of Mary Loomis.<ref name=film/> Director [[Richard Franklin (director)|Richard Franklin]] was hired to direct ''Psycho II'' because he was a Hitchcock student and even visited him on the set of ''[[Topaz (1969 film)|Topaz]]'', and because a year earlier, Franklin made a film called ''[[Roadgames]]'' starring Jamie Lee Curtis which was influenced by Hitchcock's 1954 film ''[[Rear Window]]''. Franklin hired writer [[Tom Holland (director)|Tom Holland]] to write the screenplay after Franklin had seen ''The Beast Within'', which Holland had written. Holland stated: \"I approached it with more trepidation because I was doing a sequel to ''Psycho'' and I had an overwhelming respect for Hitchcock. You didn't want to mess it up, you really had almost a moral obligation to make something that stayed true to the original and yet updated it the same time. It really was the next step, what happens when Norman gets out\". The assistant director of the original ''[[Psycho (1960 film)|Psycho]]'', [[Hilton A. Green]], was contacted and asked if he wanted to produce the film. Green, fearing that Hitchcock may not have approved of sequels to his films, called Hitchcock's daughter [[Patricia Hitchcock]] and asked what she thought of the film. Patricia Hitchcock gave her blessing to the film, saying that her father would have loved it. ''Psycho II'' was filmed at [[Universal Studios]] in [[Universal City, California]] on Stage 24 from June 30, 1982 to August 1982.<ref name=boys/>\n\nThe Bates house set was still standing from 1960, but the motel had to be reconstructed.<ref name=boys/> According to [[Richard Franklin (director)|Richard Franklin]], filming lasted 32 days. The film was made much like the first film; it was mostly shot on the backlot of Universal and on a number of sound stages. Several props and set pieces from the original film were found by set designers [[John W. Corso]] and Julie Fletcher. The town of Fairvale (seen when Lila Loomis is tailed by Dr. Raymond) is actually [[Courthouse Square]], which is located on the Universal Studios backlot in [[California]]. Both Franklin and Holland wanted the film to be a tribute to Hitchcock and the original film; to accomplish this, they added in various in jokes such as the scene when Mary and Norman first go into Norman's mother's room, before they turn the lights on; one can see Alfred Hitchcock's silhouette on the wall to the far right. Franklin also repeated various shots from the original film such as the shot where Norman walks into the kitchen and sets his jacket down on the chair. Perkins had difficulty working with actress [[Meg Tilly]] due to Tilly never seeing the original film and not being aware of the significance of Perkins' comeback role. Midway through production, Perkins suggested that Tilly be replaced even though half of her scenes had been shot. The ending of the film was kept secret during production. The final pages of the shooting script with the ending on it weren't distributed to cast and crew until the last day of filming. The iconic last shot of the movie with Norman standing in front of the house was used as a Christmas card for various crew members. When Universal presented concept art for the one-sheet film poster, director Franklin wasn't pleased with it. It was editor Andrew London who came up with the idea of using the Christmas card photo as the film poster and also came up with the tagline: \"It's 22 years later and Norman Bates is coming home\". When the film opened on June 3, 1983, it earned $8,310,244 in its opening weekend and went on to gross about $34,725,000, making it one of the top hits of the year, just behind ''[[Return of the Jedi]]''.<ref name=boys/>\n\n''Psycho II'' was generally received well by the public and critics and was a surprise box office success. However, film critics [[Gene Siskel]] and [[Roger Ebert]] both gave the film thumbs down on ''[[At the Movies (1982\u20131990 TV series)|At the Movies]]'', specifically for its failure to live up to the original. \"I think the ghost of the original,\" said Siskel, \"obviously hangs over this movie, and it's too bad because it's a nicely made picture.\" Ebert wrote of the film: \"If you've seen ''Psycho'' a dozen times and can recite the shots in the shower scene by heart, ''Psycho II'' is just not going to do it for you. But if you can accept this 1983 movie on its own terms, as a fresh start, and put your memories of Hitchcock on hold, then ''Psycho II'' begins to work. It's too heavy on plot and too willing to cheat about its plot to be really successful, but it does have its moments, and it's better than your average, run-of-the-mill slasher movie.\"<ref name=\"ebert\">{{Cite news|author=Ebert, Roger |authorlink=Roger Ebert |title=Psycho (1960) |work=Great Movies |publisher=rogerebert.com |date=1998-12-06 |url= http://rogerebert.suntimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/19981206/REVIEWS08/401010353/1023|accessdate=2006-12-01}}</ref> In the British magazine ''[[Empire (magazine)|Empire]]'', film critic [[Kim Newman]] gave the film three out of five stars, calling ''Psycho II'' \"a smart, darkly-comic thriller with some imaginative twists\", writing \" The wittiest dark joke is that the entire world ''wants'' Norman to be mad, and \u2018normality\u2019 can only be restored if he\u2019s got a mummified mother in the window and is ready to kill again.\"<ref>{{cite web|last=Newman|first=Kim|title=Empire's Psycho II Movie Review|url=https://www.empireonline.com/reviews/reviewcomplete.asp?FID=134907|publisher=Empire|accessdate=25 November 2012}}</ref>\n\nWith the surprise financial and critical success of ''Psycho II'', Universal began development on a second sequel. Writer [[Charles Edward Pogue]] was hired to write the screenplay. In Pogue's first draft of the film, it was Duane who was the killer and had intentionally come to the Bates Motel because he was obsessed with Norman. Maureen was a neurotic psychologist who had come to the motel to replace Dr. Raymond from the previous film. Pogue had intended to cast original victim [[Janet Leigh]] in the role. Universal rejected these ideas, arguing that Bates had to be the killer and Leigh was wrong for the film. However, Maureen's actions remained virtually unchanged; her character was merely changed to a young nun. After the second draft of the screenplay was completed, it was sent to Perkins as an acting job. After Perkins read the script, he wanted to direct the film, saying he would do it for nothing. Universal agreed to this. When the film went into pre-production, Anthony Perkins asked ''Psycho II'' director [[Richard Franklin (director)|Richard Franklin]] to co-direct the film with him; however Franklin declined. Filming for ''Psycho III'' began in June 1985. Perkins' main inspiration for the style of this film came from the movie ''[[Blood Simple]]'' directed by the [[Coen brothers]]. Before production began, he even took the entire cast and crew to a screening of the film. Like the two previous films, it was mostly shot on the backlot of Universal and in a number of sound stages. Despite ''Psycho III'' being Perkins' film directorial debut, the cast and crew have said in interviews that he was enjoyable to work with. [[Lee Garlington]], who played the waitress Myrna, stated: \"I have never to this date met a director who worked equally well with both the cast and crew. He was excited to be doing it, I adored him\". During filming, actor [[Jeff Fahey]] suffered an on-set injury. When filming the scene where Norman is hitting Duke with the guitar, Anthony Perkins actually hit Jeff Fahey so hard that it cut his head open and he had to get six stitches. A shot of Fahey's actual injury was used in the final film. Universal originally wanted to release the film in February 1986 but the release was moved to July 2, 1986 due to various re-shoots that included the ending. ''Psycho III'' was released on July 2, 1986 to a mixed response from critics and financial failure. It earned $3,238,400 in its opening weekend and went on to gross about $14,481,606 at the domestic box office, becoming the lowest-grossing theatrical film of the ''Psycho'' movie franchise.<ref name=\"mojo-p3\">{{cite web |url= https://boxofficemojo.com/movies/?id=psycho3.htm |title= Psycho III |website = [[Box Office Mojo]] |access-date= 2011-04-17 }}</ref>\n\nRoger Ebert gave the film three out of five stars, saying: \"Any movie named \"Psycho III\" is going to be compared to the Hitchcock original, but Perkins isn't an imitator. He has his own agenda. He has lived with Norman Bates all these years, and he has some ideas about him, and although the movie doesn't apologize for Norman, it does pity him. For the first time, I was able to see that the true horror in the \"Psycho\" movies isn't what Norman does - but the fact that he is compelled to do it.\" Vincent Canby of ''The New York Times'' said: \"It has a cast of talented, self-effacing actors, who don't upstage the material, and an efficient screenplay by Charles Edward Pogue, who doesn't beat you over the head to prove that he has a sense of humor.\" Ken Hanke of Mountain Xpress called the film a \"superior horror sequel stylishly made by star Anthony Perkins\". Dave Kehr of ''The Chicago Reader'' said: \"Perkins tries to imitate Hitchcock's visual style, but most of the film is made without concern for style of any kind, unless it's the bludgeoning nonstyle of Friday the 13th.\" ''Variety'' called the film \"dependent almost entirely upon self-referential incidents and attitudes for its effect, and it eventually becomes wearying.\"\n\nWith the financial failure of ''Psycho III'', Universal decided to continue the ''Psycho'' franchise as a television series, taking inspiration from the ''[[Friday the 13th (TV series)|Friday the 13th]]'' and ''[[Freddy's Nightmares|A Nightmare on Elm Street]]'' TV series. In this televised [[Spin-off (media)|spin-off]] of ''Psycho'', Norman Bates is portrayed by [[Kurt Paul]], who previously stood in as a [[stunt double]] for Anthony Perkins in ''Psycho II'' and ''Psycho III''. Perkins declined involvement in the project and even heavily boycotted it. The film was made as a [[pilot episode|pilot]] for a weekly anthology television series, but the series was never picked up.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0092622/trivia|title=Trivia for Bates Motel|publisher=imdb.com|accessdate=2011-04-17}}</ref> Thus, Universal decided to air the pilot as a made-for-TV film over the [[Independence Day (United States)|4th of July]] weekend. The film received mostly negative reviews and low Nielson ratings.\n\nA year after ''[[Bates Motel (film)|Bates Motel]]'' aired, production on ''[[Psycho IV: The Beginning]]'' began. Perkins wanted to direct the film and even came up with a pitch for the film along with ''Psycho III'' screenwriter Charles Edward Pogue; however ''Psycho III'' was a critical and financial failure so Universal rejected that idea and [[Mick Garris]] was brought in.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.brightlightsfilm.com/54/psychoiv.php |title=Who Owns Norman Bates? |last1= |first1= |last2= |first2= |date=November 2006 |work= |publisher=Bright Lights Film Journal |accessdate=17 October 2011 }}</ref> [[Joseph Stefano]] was the screenwriter of the original film and was brought back to write the fourth film. He had disliked the two films between I and IV, feeling that they were too commercial and catered to the conventions of slasher movies. In an interview, Stefano stated \"Gearing up for ''Psycho IV'', I decided to ignore the two sequels \u2013 like the business in II about Norman\u2019s mother.\"<ref>[http://cinefantastiqueonline.com/2008/09/interview-psycho-screenwriter-joseph-stefano/ Interview: Psycho Screenwriter Joseph Stefano By Steve Biodrowski \u2022 September 16, 2008]</ref>\n\nActress [[Olivia Hussey]] was directly offered the role of Mrs. Bates.

In the documentary ''[[The Psycho Legacy]]'', Thomas stated: \"Looking back on it now, he knew he had to have this conversation with me but I don't think that he was really into it. He just gave me a few broad strokes and told me to play the character real, that was it.\"<ref>{{cite video |people=Robert V.

Director Mick Garris has stated in numerous interviews that he had some creative control issues with Perkins. \"He would get into long, drawn-out discussions in front of the crew, testing his director, making sure choices were not made \"because it looks good\", and seeing how deep the understanding of the story and process were. He could be very forceful, just shy of bullying, but also really appreciated helpful direction. I would have to say he was the most difficult and challenging actor I've ever worked with, but he ended up going on and on about how happy he was with the film. That was gratifying\", Garris says.<ref>[http://www.thepsychomovies.com/films/psycho4/mgarris.html Interview with Director Mick Garris at \"The Psycho Movies\"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120401083024/http://www.thepsychomovies.com/films/psycho4/mgarris.html |date=2012-04-01 }}</ref>\n\n''Psycho IV: The Beginning'' was filmed at [[Universal Studios Florida]] in [[Orlando, Florida]] from June 4 to July 13, 1990. The facade of the Bates Motel and the Bates mansion were re-created at the theme park. The production was originally to be filmed before the opening of the park but due to delays and the studio's desire to have a high-profile production on the lot, the film was shot while the park was open. This led to tourists being able to watch the filming of several scenes at the motel and house on the back lot.\n\nThe film received mixed reviews when first broadcast on Showtime. Henry Stewart of ''L Magazine'' said: \"Garris evinces high-grade professionalism, but his comic-book approximations of real emotions\u2014like desire, madness and murderlust\u2014feel empty. Hitchcock this most certainly ain't.\"<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.thelmagazine.com/newyork/psycho-the-book-the-sequels/Content?oid=1794136 |title=Psycho, the Book, the Sequels |author=Mark Asch and Henry Stewart |date= |work= |publisher=The L Magazine |accessdate=17 October 2011 }}</ref> Ninja Dixon.com stated: \"This is a good TV movie, way better than {{sic|it's}} reputation, and continues the tradition of great acting in the series.\"<ref>{{cite web |url=http://ninjadixon.blogspot.com/2009/08/psycho-iv-beginning-1990.html |title=Psycho IV: The Beginning (1990) |author=Ninja Dixon |date=August 6, 2009 |work= |publisher= |accessdate=17 October 2011 }}</ref> Cult Reviews.com said: \"The film is shot well, the fire sequence, by Rodney Charters, is particularly stunning.

Some changes are pervasive: as the film opens, it is made clear that it is set in the late 1990s, so minor changes are made throughout the dialogue to reflect the new timeframe. For example, all the references to money are updated (how much Marion Crane steals, how much a car costs, how much a hotel room costs), as are references to terms from the original script like \"[[aspic]]\" that would seem [[Anachronism|anachronistic]] in the new setting.\n\nAccording to Van Sant, in the original the only fully fleshed-out character was [[Norman Bates]]; the other major characters were more iconic, purposely written and portrayed to advance the plot. Van Sant relied upon his main cast more to flesh out and make consistent their character's motivations and worked with them to determine to what degree their characters were similar to the originals. William H. Macy chose to stay true to the original, while others, such as Vaughn and Julianne Moore, interpreted the dialogue and scenes from the original film differently. Moore's version of Lila Crane was much more aggressive than the one portrayed by [[Vera Miles]], and there are differences in Marion Crane's evolving attitudes about the money she stole.\n\nThe [[cinematography]] and [[cinematic techniques]] were consistent between the two films in many memorable scenes, including the shower scene, scenes of the mother, scenes of the swamp, and the scene of Arbogast on the staircase, but other scenes changed significantly, particularly the climax, and the Dr. Simon monologue at the end, which was much shorter. Van Sant's comments from the commentary track attributes many of the updates to the need to make the film more accessible to a new audience.\n\nThe film earned $37,141,130 at the box office, $21,456,130 of which came from North America.<ref name=\"mojo-p1998\">{{mojo title|id=psycho98|title=Psycho (1998)}}</ref> Estimates of the production budget range from $20 million<ref>[https://www.the-numbers.com/movies/1998/PSYCH.php ''Psych'' (1998)] from The Numbers</ref> to $60 million;<ref name=\"mojo-p1998\"/> while promoting his 2002 film ''[[Gerry (2002 film)|Gerry]]'', Van Sant said he thought the producers \"broke even\" financially.<ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.webwombat.com.au/entertainment/movies/gus-van-sant-int.htm| title=Gus Vant Sant: Exclusive Interview| last=Morris| first=Clint| publisher=Web Wombat| accessdate=2009-03-30}}</ref>\n\nThis version of ''Psycho'' received mostly negative reviews; it was awarded two [[Golden Raspberry Award]]s, for [[Golden Raspberry Award for Worst Prequel, Remake, Rip-off or Sequel|Worst Remake or Sequel]] and [[Golden Raspberry Award for Worst Director|Worst Director]] for Gus Van Sant, while Anne Heche was nominated as [[Golden Raspberry Award for Worst Actress|Worst Actress]]. [[Camille Paglia]] commented that the only reason to watch it was \"to see Anne Heche being assassinated\", but that \"it should have been a much more important work and event than it was.\"<ref>{{cite web|last=Sragow|first=Michael|title=The Savage id|url=http://www.salon.com/1999/08/13/hitchcock_paglia/|publisher=Salon|accessdate=25 November 2012|date=13 August 1999}}</ref> A number of critics and writers viewed Van Sant's version more as an experiment in [[shot-for-shot]] remakes. Many people refer to this film as a duplicate of the [[Psycho (1960 film)|1960 film]] rather than a remake. Film critic [[Roger Ebert]] wrote that the film \"demonstrates that a shot-by-shot remake is pointless; genius apparently resides between or beneath the shots, or in chemistry that cannot be timed or counted.\"<ref>{{cite news | url=http://rogerebert.suntimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/19981206/REVIEWS/812060301/1023 | title=Review of Psycho (1998 film) | first=Roger | last=Ebert | date=1998-12-06 | authorlink=Roger Ebert | accessdate=2007-11-03 | work=Chicago Sun-Times}}</ref> Screenwriter [[Joseph Stefano]], who worked on the 1960 version, thought that although she spoke the same lines, Anne Heche portrays Marion Crane as an entirely different character.<ref>{{cite news | title=Psycho Analysis: An Interview With Screenwriter Joseph Stefano | url=http://www.austinchronicle.com/gyrobase/Issue/story?oid=oid%3A74285 | publisher=[[The Austin Chronicle]] | date=1999-10-15 | accessdate=2007-11-03}}</ref> Even Van Sant admitted that it was an experiment that proved that no one can really copy a film exactly the same way as the original.<ref>{{cite news | title=The odd world of Gus Van Sant | url=http://www.iht.com/articles/2005/07/14/news/gus.php | publisher=[[International Herald Tribune]] | date=2005-07-15 | accessdate=2007-11-03}}</ref> [[Janet Maslin]] gave the film a positive review, calling it an \"artful, good-looking remake (a modest term, but it beats plagiarism) that shrewdly revitalizes the aspects of the real ''Psycho'' (1960) that it follows most faithfully but seldom diverges seriously or successfully from one of the cinema's most brilliant blueprints\"; she noted that the \"absence of anything like [[Anthony Perkins]]'s sensational performance with that vitally birdlike presence and sneaky way with a [[Double entendre|double-entendre]] (\"A boy's best friend is his mother\") is the new film's greatest weakness.\"<ref>{{cite news| url=https://movies.nytimes.com/movie/review?res=9D0DE7DD1E3BF936A35751C1A96E958260| title=The Mama's Boy, His Motel Guest And That Shower| last=Maslin| first=Janet| authorlink=Janet Maslin| publisher=[[The New York Times]]| date=December 5, 1998| accessdate=2009-03-30}}</ref> Critic [[Leonard Maltin]] gave the film a rating of one out of four stars, or \"BOMB\" compared to the four stars he gave the original.

''[[Psycho (1998 film)|Psycho]]'' (1998), a shot-for-shot [[remake]] of the first film is not a sequel since it retells the same events as the original film, but set in 1998. There are also some continuity problems in ''Psycho IV: The Beginning'' that have to do with some of the past events explored in ''Psycho'', ''Psycho II'', and ''Psycho III''. Reflecting on the continuity issues, Robert Price writes \"It seems that all the different Psychos drift into and out of one another. There is no real sequence. All are variant versions of the same myth.

All three sequels have been nominated for Saturn Awards. ''[[Psycho II (film)|Psycho II]]'' received a nomination for Best Screenplay for writer [[Tom Holland (director)|Tom Holland]]. ''[[Psycho III]]'' was nominated for Best Horror Film. ''[[Psycho IV: The Beginning]]'' was nominated for Best Genre Television Series.\n\n===Legacy===\n''[[Psycho (1960 film)|Psycho]]'' has become one of the most recognizable films ever made. The shower scene alone has become one of the most iconic cut scenes in cinematic history. ''Psycho'' is frequently referenced, given homage to or spoofed in television shows such as ''[[The Simpsons]]'', ''[[South Park]]'', ''[[American Dad!]]'', ''[[The Mary Tyler Moore Show]]'' and more. Films such as ''[[Scream 2]]'', ''[[Charlie and the Chocolate Factory (film)|Charlie and the Chocolate Factory]]'', ''[[Throw Momma from the Train]]'', ''[[Scary Movie]]'' and more have referenced the film. Many critics and filmmakers have cited ''Psycho'' as the film that modernized the horror genre. Horror writer David. J. Schow stated (in ''[[The Psycho Legacy]]'') \"It brought the idea that the killer in a horror film was not a mutant, didn't have dents in his head; he could look like that nice young boy from next door\". The film also brought in a new level of acceptable violence and sexuality in movies. Both [[Anthony Perkins]] and [[Janet Leigh]] spent the rest of their careers being typecasted by the film. Even [[Alfred Hitchcock]]'s films began to decline in critical and financial popularity after the release of ''Psycho''. Hitchcock film scholars argue that for the rest of his career, Hitchcock's films were constantly being compared to ''Psycho''. The \"Psycho\" films still maintain a very large fanbase. Various websites dedicated to the franchise such as ''The Psycho Movies.com'' have appeared on the Internet. Books detailing the making and impact of the film such as ''Alfred Hitchcock and The Making of Psycho'', ''The Moment of Psycho'', Janet Leigh's ''Psycho: Behind The Scenes of the Classic Thriller'' have been published over the years. Two retrospective documentaries have been released detailing the making of all four films including ''The Making of Psycho'' (1997) and ''[[The Psycho Legacy]]'' (2010). The film also spawned the show ''[[Alfred Hitchcock: The Art of Making Movies]]'' at [[Universal Studios Florida]], with part of the show detailing how the shower scene was filmed. In 1992, ''Psycho'' was added to the [[National Film Registry]] by the [[Library of Congress]].\n\nA musical stage adaptation was performed January-February 2019 at PULP Black Box Theatre in Atlanta, GA. <ref>https://www.facebook.com/events/1973956552682770/</ref>\n\n==Other media and merchandise==\n\nVarious ''Psycho'' related merchandise has been sold ever since the release of the original film. Merchandise includes T-shirts, posters, DVDs, books, stationery, shot glasses, shower curtains, action figures, model house kits, pens and more. Much of the merchandise is related to the fictional Bates Motel where items commonly found in an actual motel have the Bates Motel logo on them. A Bates Motel light up sign was released in 2009. To coincide with the 50th anniversary of the release of the original film, a Psycho house model kit was released in the U.S. Props from all the films are also sold occasionally on [[eBay]]. The original one sheet poster for ''[[Psycho (1960 film)|Psycho]]'' is worth around $3000 in mint condition. The original one sheets for ''[[Psycho II (film)|Psycho II]]'', ''[[Psycho III]]'' and ''[[Psycho IV: The Beginning]]'' are worth around $50 each.\n\n===Graphic novels===\nIn 1992, a series of [[graphic novel]]s based on the original ''[[Psycho (1960 film)|Psycho]]'' was published by the Innovation Comics group. Today, the novels are out of print and are very rare to find.{{citation needed|date=August 2016}}\n\n===The ''Psycho'' House and Bates Motel sets===\nThe Bates House and Motel were constructed on the backlot at [[Universal Studios Hollywood|Universal City Studios]] in 1959 for the production of ''[[Psycho (1960 film)|Psycho]]''. It has been said that the house, designed by art directors [[Joseph Hurley (art director)|Joseph Hurley]] and [[Robert Clatworthy (art director)|Robert Clathworthy]], was loosely based on an [[Edward Hopper]] painting called \"House by the Railroad\". The house and motel sets were actually empty shells, also known as facades. When the house was originally built, there was no right side of the house, since the right side is never seen on camera in the original ''Psycho'' film. Interiors of the Bates house and motel were constructed on Sound stage 18-A at Universal, just a short walk from the actual exterior locations making production convenient for all involved. After production had wrapped on ''Psycho'', the house was featured in several television productions including ''[[The Virginian (TV series)|The Virginian]]'' and ''[[Thriller (American TV series)|Boris Karloff's Thriller]]''.\n\nIn 1964, Universal Studios opened its patented [[Studio Tour|Studio Tram Tour]]. The right side of the house was then added and the set was unceremoniously dubbed \"The Psycho House\". The house and even the motel went on to appear in several shows such as ''[[Night Gallery]]'', ''[[The Hardy Boys/Nancy Drew Mysteries]]'' and even in films such as ''[[Invitation to a Gunfighter]]'' and ''[[Modern Problems]]''. The motel was torn down in 1979 and the house was moved to an alternate location on the backlot to accommodate the new tour. In 1982, Richard Franklin and Hilton A. Green announced plans to film ''[[Psycho II (film)|Psycho II]]''. The house was then moved to a location that best matched the original hill and only about 40 feet of the motel was actually re-built. The rest of the motel in the film was a matte painting. TV shows during the '80s promoted the Universal Tour and prominently featured the Psycho House including ''[[Amazing Stories (1985 TV series)|Amazing Stories]]'', ''[[Knight Rider (1982 TV series)|Knight Rider]]'' and ''[[Diff'rent Strokes]]''.\n\nIn 1985, the Bates Motel was fully re-built for the filming of ''[[Psycho III]]''. In 1987, the NBC-TV network announced plans for the TV pilot ''[[Bates Motel (film)|Bates Motel]]''. The motel in the film was re-modeled to look very Spanish like. This version of the set remained until 1994 when the new renovations were taken away and the motel was put back to look the way it did in the original Psycho. An episode of ''[[Murder, She Wrote]]'' called \"Incident in Lot 7\" in 1992 featured the Psycho House and Bates Motel as key locations in the popular [[Angela Lansbury]] series.\n\nIn 1988, plans for ''[[Psycho IV: The Beginning]]'' were underway at Universal. Plans to shoot the movie in Orlando, Florida were set into motion and the film crew constructed a full-scale replica of the Bates Motel and Psycho House at the soon-to-be built [[Universal Studios Florida]]. The final dressing and painting was done by the Psycho IV art department crew in 1990, but the house and motel was fully built in 1988 long before the production team was assembled for the project. After production wrapped, the sets were left as attractions at the park until 1999 when it was torn down to make room for another attraction.\n\nIn 1998, the Psycho House in California was renovated to preserve the set. All of the rotting wood was replaced and the set had a new paint job. That same year, plans to remake ''Psycho'' were announced. It was originally announced that Gus Van Sant was going to be using the original house and motel sets. However, the production team built a new house directly in front of the old one, and the motel was updated to look like it was from the 1960s. The new house was moved next to the original house and remained there for about three years after production. In 2003, due to popular demand, the remake's house was torn down and the motel was restored to the original way once again. To this day, the house and motel are still standing on the backlot of Universal and continue to be major tourist attractions. The [[Studio Tour|tram tour]] features an actor playing Norman Bates coming out of cabin 1 with a body, putting it in the trunk of a car and then wielding a large knife at the tourists as the tram drives away.\n\n===''24 Hour Psycho''===\nAn art installation, ''[[24 Hour Psycho]]'', created by artist [[Douglas Gordon]] in 1993, and later installed in the [[Museum of Modern Art]] in New York, consists of a silent screening of ''Psycho'', slowed down to two frames per second (from the usual 24), so that it lasts 24 hours rather than 109 minutes. ''24 Hour Psycho'' is featured prominently in [[Don DeLillo]]'s 2010 novel ''[[Point Omega]]''.\n\n===''The Psycho Legacy'' (2010)===\n{{Main|The Psycho Legacy}}\nIn 2010, a [[direct-to-video|direct-to-DVD]] documentary was released called ''The Psycho Legacy''. It included interviews with cast and crew from all four Psycho films. It also featured interviews with current horror filmmakers who are fans of the series. The documentary was written, produced and directed by horror journalist Robert Galluzzo. Galluzo made the documentary because of the lack of information on the sequels and also to celebrate the 50th anniversary of the release of the original film. The documentary discussed the impact and legacy of the original ''[[Psycho (1960 film)|Psycho]]'' and the production stories of ''[[Psycho II (film)|Psycho II]]'', ''[[Psycho III]]'' and ''[[Psycho IV: The Beginning]]''. To the surprise of some critics and fans, the failed TV pilot ''[[Bates Motel (film)|Bates Motel]]'' and the [[Gus Van Sant]] [[Psycho (1998 film)|remake]] were not discussed in the documentary, however originally in the deleted scenes section on the DVD two short segments on the two films were supposed to be on there, however for unknown reasons they were left off of the DVD when it was released. The documentary sold well, received mostly positive reviews and garnered new interest in the series from horror fans.\n\n===''Hitchcock'' (2012)===\n{{Main|Hitchcock (film)}}\nOn April 13, 2012, production started on a film adaptation of [[Stephen Rebello]]'s non-fiction book ''[[Alfred Hitchcock and the Making of Psycho]]'', which follows the complex relationship between [[Alfred Hitchcock]] and wife [[Alma Reville]] during the filming of ''[[Psycho (1960 film)|Psycho]]'' in 1959. The film is directed by [[Sacha Gervasi]] and stars [[Anthony Hopkins]] as director Alfred Hitchcock, Helen Mirren as his wife [[Alma Reville]], [[Scarlett Johansson]] as [[Janet Leigh]], [[Jessica Biel]] as [[Vera Miles]], and [[James D'Arcy]] as [[Anthony Perkins]]. Produced by [[The Montecito Picture Company]] and distributed by [[Fox Searchlight Pictures]], the film was released on November 23, 2012 in selected cities with a worldwide release on December 14, 2012. The film has received mixed reviews from critics and moderate box office returns, with a worldwide gross of $5,337,378 as of January 3, 2013.\n\n===2017 documentary: \"78/52\"===\n\nA documentary on the production of ''Psycho'' was released on Oct 13, 2017 by director Alexandre O. Philippe running 91 minutes. The cast of participants included Guillermo del Toro, Peter Bogdanovich, Bret Easton Ellis, Jamie Lee Curtis, Karyn Kusama, Eli Roth, Oz Perkins, Leigh Whannell, Walter Murch, Danny Elfman, Elijah Wood, Richard Stanley, and Neil Marshall.<ref>. {{cite web | date = January 24, 2017 | author = Owen Gleiberman | url = https://variety.com/2017/film/reviews/7852-review-psycho-1201966555/ | title = Film Review: \u201878/52: Hitchcock\u2019s Shower Scene\u2019 | work = [[Variety (magazine)|Variety Magazine]] }}</ref>\n\n==Notes==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==References==\n* [[Janet Leigh|Leigh, Janet]]; Nickens, Christopher (1995).

The first film, ''Psycho'', was directed by filmmaker [[Alfred Hitchcock]].<ref>http://www.thepsychomovies.com/movies/psycho/</ref> Subsequently, another film related to the series was made: an [[Hitchcock (film)|Alfred Hitchcock biopic]] based on the book ''[[Alfred Hitchcock and the Making of Psycho]]''. Also, an independent documentary called ''[[The Psycho Legacy]]'' was released on October 19, 2010. It mostly focused on ''Psycho II'', ''Psycho III'' and ''Psycho IV: The Beginning'', but did cover the impact and legacy of the original film. \n\nA five-season TV series, ''[[Bates Motel (TV series)|Bates Motel]]'', aired on [[A&E (TV channel)|A&E]] between 2013 and 2017. In a modern-day setting, it is an imagining of the Norman and (at first, a living) Norma Bates characters, and their unusual relationship. It stars [[Freddie Highmore]] as teenaged Norman and [[Vera Farmiga]] as mother Norma.\n\nThe films focus on the life of [[Norman Bates]], a deeply disturbed young man who operates the Bates Motel. He is mentally unstable from a domineering relationship with his mother, which results in him having a psychotic twisted personality and, as a result, he occasionally kills people.\n\n==Novels==\n{{unsourced section|date=August 2016}}\n===''Psycho'' (1959)===\n{{Main|Psycho (novel)}}\nIn 1959, the novel ''Psycho'' was published. It was loosely based on the Wisconsin serial killer and cannibal [[Ed Gein]]. Author [[Robert Bloch]] lived 40 miles away from Gein's farmhouse and liked the idea of somebody being able to kill people in a small community and get away with it for years without being caught. The character of [[Norman Bates]] was very different in the novel from in [[Psycho (1960 film)|the film version]]. In the novel, Bates is overweight, in his early 40s and drinks heavily. When [[Joseph Stefano]] adapted the novel into the screenplay, he made the character of Norman young, attractive and vulnerable.\n\n===''Psycho II'' (1982)===\n{{Main|Psycho II (novel)}}\nIn 1982, Bloch wrote a sequel novel called ''Psycho II'' which had nothing to do with the [[Psycho II (film)|1983 film version]]. In the novel, Norman Bates escapes the mental institution and goes to Hollywood to stop the production of a film based on his life. Many critics and fans described the novel as being silly and weird and couldn't have possibly been made into a film.\n\n===''Psycho House'' (1990)===\n{{Main|Psycho House}}\nIn 1990, due to the pressure from his publishing company, Bloch wrote a third novel called ''Psycho House''. However, according to horror writer [[David J. Schow]], when writing it Bloch originally called it ''Psycho 13''. In the novel, ten years after Norman Bates' death, the Bates mansion and motel are bought as [[tourist attraction]]s and a series of murders begin to take place.\n\n==Films==\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center;\"\n|-\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Occupation\n! colspan=\"6\" | Film title\n|-\n!

While en route to Sam's [[California]] home, she parks along the road to sleep. A highway patrol officer awakens her and, suspicious of her agitation, follows her. When she trades her car for another at a dealership, he notes the new vehicle's details. Marion returns to the road but, rather than drive in a heavy storm, decides to spend the night at the Bates Motel.  The proprietor, [[Norman Bates]] ([[Anthony Perkins]]), tells Marion he rarely has customers because of the motel's disconnection from a new [[Interstate highway system|Interstate]] and mentions he lives with [[Norma Bates (Psycho)|his mother]] in the house overlooking the motel. He invites Marion to supper. She overhears Norman arguing with his mother about letting Marion in the house, and during the meal, she angers him by suggesting he institutionalize his mother. He admits he would like this, but does not want to abandon her.\n\nMarion resolves to return to Phoenix to return the money. After calculating how she can repay the money she has spent, Marion dumps her notes down the toilet and begins to shower. An anonymous female figure enters the bathroom and stabs her to death. Finding the corpse, Norman is horrified. He places Marion's body, wrapped in the shower curtain, and all her possessions &mdash; including the money &mdash; in the trunk of her car and sinks it in a nearby swamp.\n\nShortly afterward, Sam is contacted by both Marion's sister [[Lila Crane]] ([[Vera Miles]]) and private detective Milton Arbogast ([[Martin Balsam]]), who has been hired by Marion's employer to recover the money. Arbogast traces Marion to the motel and questions Norman, who unconvincingly lies that Marion stayed for one night and left the following morning. He refuses to let Arbogast talk to his mother, claiming she is ill. Arbogast calls Lila to update her and tells her he will call again after he questions Norman's mother.\n\nArbogast enters Norman's house and at the top of the stairs is attacked by a figure who slashes his face with a knife, pushes him down the stairs, then stabs him to death. When Arbogast does not call Lila, she and Sam contact the local police. Deputy Sheriff Al Chambers ([[John McIntire]]) is perplexed to learn Arbogast saw a woman in a window since Norman's mother died ten years ago. Norman confronts his mother and urges her to hide in the cellar. She rejects the idea and orders him out of her room, but against her will, Norman carries her to the cellar.\n\nPosing as a married couple, Sam and Lila check into the motel and search Marion's room, where they find a scrap of paper in the toilet with \"$40,000\" written on it. While Sam distracts Norman, Lila sneaks into the house. Sam suggests to Norman that he killed Marion for the money so he could buy a new hotel. Realizing Lila is not around, Norman knocks Sam unconscious and rushes to the house. Lila sees him and hides in the cellar where she discovers the semi-preserved and [[mummy|mummified]] body of Norman's mother. Wearing his mother's clothes and a wig and carrying a knife, Norman enters and tries to attack Lila, but she is rescued by Sam.\n\nAfter Norman's arrest, [[forensic psychiatry|forensic psychiatrist]] Dr. Richmond ([[Simon Oakland]]) tells Sam and Lila that Norman's dead mother is living in Norman's [[Psyche (psychology)|psyche]] as an [[dissociative identity disorder|alternate personality]]. After the death of Norman's father, the pair lived as if they were the only people in the world. When his mother found a lover, Norman went mad with jealousy and murdered them both. Consumed with guilt, Norman \"erased the crime\" by bringing his mother back to life in his mind. He stole her corpse and preserved the body. When he was \"Mother\", he acted, talked, and dressed as she would. The psychiatrist concludes that the \"Mother\" personality now has complete control of Norman's mind.\n\nIn the final scene, Norman sits in a cell, thinking in \"Mother's\" voice. In a voiceover, \"Mother\" explains that she plans to prove that she is incapable of violence by refusing to swat a fly that has landed on her hand. The final shot shows Marion's car being recovered from the swamp.\n\n===''Psycho II'' (1983)===\n{{Main|Psycho II (film)}}\n[[Norman Bates]] ([[Anthony Perkins]]) is released from a mental institution after 22 years. [[Lila Crane|Lila Loomis]] ([[Vera Miles]]), the sister of Bates' victim [[Marion Crane]] and widow of the now-deceased Sam Loomis, vehemently protests with a petition that she has been circulating with signatures of 743 people, including the relatives of the six people Norman killed prior to his incarceration, but her plea is dismissed. Norman is taken to his old home, the Bates Motel, with the house behind it on the hill, by Dr. Bill Raymond ([[Robert Loggia]]), who assures him everything will be fine. He is introduced to the motel's new manager, Warren Toomey ([[Dennis Franz]]). The following day, Norman reports to a pre-arranged job at a nearby diner, run by a kindly old lady named [[Emma Spool]] ([[Claudia Bryar]]). One of his co-workers there is Mary Loomis ([[Meg Tilly]]), a young waitress. Mary claims she has been thrown out of her boyfriend's place and needs a place to stay. Norman offers to let her stay at the motel, then extends the offer to his home when he discovers that Toomey has turned his beloved establishment into a sleazy adult motel.\n\nNorman's adjustment back into society appears to be going along well until \"Mother\" begins to make her presence known. Norman gets mysterious notes from \"Mother\" at the house and diner. Phone calls come from someone claiming to be Norman's mother. Toomey picks a fight at the diner after Norman fires him. Later, a figure in a black dress stabs Toomey to death with a kitchen knife as he is packing to leave the motel. Norman begins to doubt his sanity when he begins hearing voices in the house. He enters his mother's bedroom to find it looks exactly as it did 22 years ago. A sound lures him to the attic, where he is locked in. Believing the house to be abandoned, a teenage couple sneaks in through the cellar window. They notice a female figure pacing in the next room. As they try to climb out, the boy is stabbed to death. The girl escapes and alerts the police. Mary eventually finds Norman in the attic. Sheriff Hunt ([[Hugh Gillin]]) questions them about the boy's murder. He finds the cellar neat and orderly. Norman is about to admit that something suspicious is going on, but Mary claims that she has cleaned up the basement herself. After the sheriff leaves, Norman asks Mary why she lied. She explains that she had to save him from being arrested. Norman collapses into the chair with his head in his hands and moans, \"It's starting again!\"\n\nMary is startled later when she discovers someone looking at her through a peephole in the bathroom wall. She calls out to Norman, who is downstairs and out of reach. The two are horrified to find a bloody cloth that has been stuffed down the toilet. Norman appears confused and believes he may have committed another murder. Mary goes down to check the motel. In the parlor she is surprised by Lila, who reveals herself to be Mary's mother. She has been calling Norman claiming to be his mother, even going so far as to dress up as her and allowing him to see her in the window. Mary has been helping her. She was responsible for restoring Mother's room at the house and locking Norman in the attic. All of this was an attempt to drive Norman insane again and have him recommitted.\n\nMary's growing feelings for Norman, however, have been preying on her conscience leaving her to reconsider her actions. Meanwhile, Dr. Raymond discovers Mary's identity as Lila's daughter and informs Norman. He also orders the corpse of Norma Bates (which was buried in a proper grave after the events of the original film) to be exhumed, to prove that Norman isn't being haunted by his mother. Mary admits to Norman that she has been part of Lila's ruse, and that while she now refuses to continue, Lila won't stop. Mary goes to Lila's hotel and their argument is overheard by a bartender. Later, Lila drives over to Norman's house, unaware that Dr. Raymond is watching her from the Bates Motel as she sneaks into the cellar. While removing her \"Mother\" costume from a loose stone in the floor, another figure dressed as \"Mother\" steps out of the shadows and murders her. Dr. Raymond runs up to the house. Lila's body is not in the cellar.\n\nMeanwhile, Mary discovers that a car has been retrieved from the swamp, with Toomey's body in the trunk. Realizing the police will shortly arrive to arrest Norman, Mary returns to warn him. The phone rings in the house, Norman answers, and starts speaking to his \"mother\". Mary listens in and discovers that nobody is on the line with Norman. Terrified, Mary runs downstairs into the cellar, and quickly dresses up as Mother to confront Norman. Someone grabs her from behind, and she plunges the butcher knife into ... Dr. Raymond, who has sneaked back into the house. A stunned Mary runs downstairs and is confronted by a deranged Norman, who promises to cover up for \"Mother\". Mary tries to keep him away, repeatedly stabbing him in the hands and chest. He backs Mary into the fruit cellar to hide and slips on a pile of coal, which avalanches away from the wall, revealing Lila's body hidden behind it. Mary is now convinced that Norman had been committing the murders. She raises her knife to stab him and is shot to death by the incoming police. The sheriff inaccurately believes Lila and Mary committed all the murders.\n\nThat evening, a woman walks up the steps to the Bates' mansion. Bandaged from his injuries, Norman has set a place for dinner when he hears a knock at the door. It is Emma Spool, the kindly woman from the diner. Norman gives her a cup of tea. Mrs. Spool tells him that she is his real mother, that Mrs. Bates was her sister, who adopted Norman as an infant while Mrs. Spool was institutionalized. She further reveals that she was the murderer, having killed anybody who tried to harm her son. As she sips the tea, Norman kills her with a sudden blow to the head with a shovel. Norman is now completely insane again. He carries Mrs. Spool's body upstairs to Mother's room and we hear Mother's voice warn Norman not to play with \"filthy girls\". Norman reopens the Bates Motel and stands in front of the house, waiting for new customers as Mother watches from the window upstairs.\n\n===''Psycho III'' (1986)===\n{{Main|Psycho III}}\nMaureen Coyle ([[Diana Scarwid]]), a mentally unstable young nun, is on top of a bell tower about to commit suicide. When another nun tries to get her to come down, Maureen accidentally pushes her over the railing to her death. Another nun tells Maureen that she will burn in hell. She is forced to leave the convent after this ordeal.\n\n[[Norman Bates]] ([[Anthony Perkins]]) is still manning the desk at the Bates Motel and living with the preserved corpse of his real mother, [[Emma Spool]] ([[Claudia Bryar]]), whom Norman killed at the end of ''Psycho II''. Local law enforcement and Norman's ex-boss Ralph Statler ([[Robert Alan Browne]]) are concerned since Mrs. Spool has been missing for over a month. Duane Duke ([[Jeff Fahey]]), a sleazy musician desperate for money, is offered the job of assistant manager at the Bates Motel. Maureen, now the new long-term tenant, has some issues to resolve in her life. She gave up her vows as a nun only days before, and she isn't sure just how she feels about either spiritual or earthly matters.\n\nSheriff John Hunt ([[Hugh Gillin]]) and Statler have a conversation at the diner, when Tracy Venable ([[Roberta Maxwell]]), a pushy journalist from Los Angeles, interrupts them. She is working on an article about serial killers being put back on the streets. Venable is trying to back up her theory that Norman is back to his old ways again. Norman appears and Venable jumps at the chance to talk with him. Unaware of her ulterior motives Norman opens up to her, but is distracted when an exhausted Maureen enters and sits at the lunch counter. He is startled by Maureen's presence, because he feels she strongly resembles [[Marion Crane]] ([[Janet Leigh]]). Seeing the initials \"M.C.\" on her suitcase, Norman freaks out and leaves the diner. After a conversation with \"Mother\", Norman spies on Maureen as she undresses and heads into the bathroom to take a shower. Keeping \"her\" word, \"Mother\" enters Maureen's motel room with plans to kill her. Upon pulling back the shower curtain, it is revealed Maureen has attempted suicide by cutting her wrists, a sight which snaps Norman back to his \"normal\" side. Maureen looks up at \"Mother\" who is so weakened by what \"she\" sees, \"she\" lowers the knife. Due to blood loss, Maureen hallucinates and she mistakes Norman, dressed up as \"Mother\", for the [[Mary, mother of Jesus|Virgin Mary]] holding a silver crucifix.\n\nMeanwhile, Tracy has met with Duane at a bar where they discuss Norman, and it seems Tracy blames Norman for Mrs. Spool's disappearance. When she leaves, Duane picks up another girl at the bar, Red ([[Juliette Cummins]]). Norman gets Maureen to the local hospital to save her life. After she is released, he invites her to stay back at the motel and they begin a romantic relationship. The same night, Duane and Red arrive at the motel and hear an argument between \"Mother\" and Norman, but think it's just a TV turned up too loud. Red and Duane, head to cabin 12 where they make love. Later that night, Red, makes it clear she wants more than just a fling. Calling him a pig, they argue. Duane, infuriated, throws her out of the cabin. Red heads down to the payphone to call a cab, where she realizes she is wearing her blouse backwards. As she takes it off to put it on the right way, \"Mother\" shatters the phone booth door and stabs a trapped Red to death. The next morning, Duane finds Norman scrubbing down the phone booth.\n\nA group from out of town arrive at the motel where they plan to watch the local [[American football|football]] game. Tracy comes to find Norman and ask questions about his past and \"Mother\". Norman becomes defensive with the reporter and tells her to leave, never to return. Later that night, he and Maureen go to a restaurant, where they dance and talk romantically, while Tracy searches Mrs. Spool's apartment. She discovers the Bates Motel's telephone number written on a magazine cover. Norman and Maureen return to the motel to find most of the other guests engaged in drunken stupor. Norman goes with Maureen to her room and they fall asleep in each other's arms having refused to make love. Some time afterwards, Patsy Boyle (Katt Shea Ruben), the only sober guest, wakes up Maureen to ensure her safety as Norman had left the door open, a bad idea with all the drunken guests around. Patsy, needing to use the bathroom, finds the one in Norman's parlor unoccupied, but \"Mother\" again emerges and slashes her throat. Norman (an homage to the reaction of finding Marion dead in the shower in the original ''[[Psycho (1960 film)|Psycho]]'') gasps when he discovers Patsy's body. He buries her in the motel's ice chest outside the office.\n\nThe next morning, Sheriff Hunt and Deputy Leo appear at Norman's house to investigate Patsy's disappearance. Norman tries to prevent Hunt from entering his mother's bedroom, when he discovers that \"Mother\"/Mrs. Spool has disappeared completely. Outside, Tracy tells Maureen about Norman, and she, rather upset, leaves the motel and goes to stay with Father Brian (Gary Bayer), who took care of her at the hospital. Meanwhile, Tracy is convinced Norman is behind the latest disappearances. Norman searches for his mother all over the house and finds a note from her stating that she is in cabin 12. When Norman arrives at the cabin, he learns it was Duane who took \"Mother\". Duane confronts him then attempts to blackmail Norman into paying him off, or he'll turn Norman into the police. He tells Duane he doesn't have that kind of money, but Duane reminds him that Norman has made a lot of cash from his business, and if Norman doesn't give money for his silence, he will go to the police. He agrees to Duane's blackmail demands, but he then unexpectedly throws an ashtray at Duane's head. They fight and Norman seemingly kills Duane by hitting him several times with his own guitar. Terrified of what he has done, he blames \"Mother\" for this.\n\nTracy talks to Statler and Myrna ([[Lee Garlington]]) about Mrs. Spool and discovers she was working at the diner before Statler bought it from Harvey Leach. Tracy meets with Leach, a resident at an assisted living facility, and is informed that Mrs. Spool had also once been institutionalized for murder. Meanwhile, Norman drives Duane's car to the swamp with Duane and Patsy's bodies in it. Duane turns out to be alive and attacks Norman, who accidentally drives the car into the swamp. He struggles out of the car while Duane drowns. Tracy reads some old newspapers at her study and discovers about the \"Bates kidnapping\".\n\nMaureen convinces herself that Norman is her true love. She returns to the motel and takes a shower before visiting Norman at his house. They share a tender moment at the top of the staircase when \"Mother\" shouts furiously at Norman, which startles him and causes him to lose grip on Maureen's hands. She falls down the stairs into the Cupid statue at the base of the stairs. She goes limp and sinks to the floor revealing the arrow had punctured her skull. Distraught, Norman screams and confronts his mother, saying that he will get her for this. \"You don't have the guts, boy!\" declares \"Mother\".\n\nAt that moment, Tracy arrives at the motel and tries to find Maureen. She enters the house only to find her lying dead on the couch of the living room which is filled with lit candles. Then she sees Norman dressed as \"Mother\", holding a knife, and tries to flee. She tries to reason with Norman by explaining his family history: Emma Spool, who ''was'' in fact his aunt, was in love with Norman's father, but he married her sister, Norma, instead. Mrs. Spool, having serious psychological problems, kidnapped Norman when he was a baby after she killed Mr. Bates, believing Norman was the child \"she should have had with him.\" She discovers Mrs. Spool's corpse in the bedroom, and Norman takes off his mother's dress. \"Mother\" orders him to kill Tracy, and when Norman raises the knife, he instead brutally attacks \"Mother,\" dismembering her preserved remains. The last scene shows Sheriff Hunt taking Norman to his squad car, with Father Brian and Tracy following behind. Hunt informs Norman that they may never let him out of the institution again, Norman replies, \"But I'll be free... I'll finally be free.\" Norman, sitting silently in the back of the squad car on the way to the institution, enjoys his victory over his mother by caressing a trophy: the severed hand of Mrs. Spool. He smiles sardonically as the screen fades to black and the credits roll.\n\n===''Bates Motel'' (1987)===\n{{main|Bates Motel (film)}}\nAlex West ([[Bud Cort]]) is a mentally disturbed youth who was admitted to an asylum after killing his abusive stepfather. At the asylum, he roomed with [[Norman Bates]] ([[Kurt Paul]]) and they eventually became close friends. Years later, Norman dies and Alex learns that he has inherited the Bates Motel. He travels to Norman's California hometown (renamed Fairville for this film; in the original film it was Fairvale) and with a little help from teenage runaway Willy ([[Lori Petty]]) and local handyman Henry Watson ([[Moses Gunn]]), Alex struggles to re-open the motel for business, until rumors about the place being haunted by the ghost of Norman's mother, Mrs. Bates, are apparently true. Only to find that the haunting was a prank and the ghost was the bank manager, Tom Fuller ([[Gregg Henry]]), who refused to give Alex a loan by trying to scare him away. Tom is then forced to help Alex and the others with renovating the motel or face prison for fraud. The motel was soon finished with the renovation.\n\nMeanwhile, Barbara Peters ([[Kerrie Keane]]) runs away from home and ends up staying in Alex's motel for the night, contemplating suicide for getting older, going through three divorces, and not having children. Barbara meets a teenage girl ([[Khrystyne Haje]]), who invites Barbara to dance at an after prom party in the motel with her and her teenage friends, including Tony Scotti ([[Jason Bateman]]), though Barbara felt uncomfortable hanging with young kids. It is then revealed that Barbara's real name is Sally, and that the teenage girl is her younger self from an alternate dimension who took her own life and is now trapped in \"the other side\", along with Tony, and other teens who also committed suicide. Sally tells Barbara that she has a life worth living for, then Sally leaves with the rest of the group. Barbara leaves the motel the next day, planning to live her life to the fullest. Alex looks at the screen telling viewers, \"If you ever need a room, come by. I can't say for sure what you'll find, but it is what makes the world go around.\"\n\n===''Psycho IV: The Beginning'' (1990)===\n{{Main|Psycho IV: The Beginning}}\nFran Ambrose ([[CCH Pounder]]) is a radio talk show host who is talking on the topic of \"matricide\" (when children kill their mothers) with guest Dr. Richmond ([[Warren Frost]]), who was [[Norman Bates]]' former psychologist. The radio receives a call from Norman Bates ([[Anthony Perkins]]), who has re-entered society and married his former psychiatrist, Connie (Donna Mitchell). Under the alias of \"Ed\" (possibly a reference to Ed Gein, the killer after whom the character of Norman was modeled), Norman tells his story, which the audience sees as a series of flashbacks set in the 1940s and 1950s. Some flashbacks are [[Reverse chronology|slightly out of order]]. The chronological story is: In 1950, Norman's mother, [[Norma Bates (Psycho)|Norma Bates]] ([[Olivia Hussey]]) had schizophrenia (see ''[[Psycho II (film)|Psycho II]]''); she was smothering Norman and would have violent mood swings. Due to Norman's sexual repression at her hands, when she was frolicking with him he had an incestuous erection, causing her to dress him in women's clothing and taunt him by calling him \"Norma.\" She then got engaged to a man named Chet Rudolph (Thomas Schuster), who would beat up Norman. Eventually Norman got fed up with her allowing Chet to be in their lives and poisoned them both, albeit reluctantly. He then developed his infamous multiple personality disorder and stole her corpse to create the illusion that she was alive - whenever her corpse spoke to him, the \"Norma\" personality would take over. This caused Norman as \"Norma\" to kill two women who wanted to have sex with him.\n\nThroughout the spaces in the flashbacks, Dr. Richmond realizes \"Ed\" is Norman and tries to convince Fran to trace the calls. Richmond's worries are dismissed because they cannot trace the call and they believe they can talk Norman out of the reason he called: he fears he will kill again. He tells Fran that Connie got pregnant against his wishes and that he does not want another \"monster\". He then tells Fran he does believe his mother is dead, but he will kill Connie \"with my own hands, just like the first time\". He then takes Connie to his mother's house and attempts to kill her, but after Connie reassures Norman that their child will not be a monster, he drops his knife in shame and Connie forgives him. He then burns the house where all his unhappiness began. As he tries to escape the flames, he hallucinates that he sees his victims, Chet, his mother and eventually himself preserving her corpse. He and Connie leave the scene with Norman stating, \"I'm free.\"  However, as the credits roll, the sound of his newborn baby crying can be heard.\n\n===''Psycho'' (1998)===\n{{Main|Psycho (1998 film)}}\nIn need of money to get her boyfriend Sam Loomis ([[Viggo Mortensen]]) out of debt, [[Marion Crane]] ([[Anne Heche]]) steals $400,000 from her employer and flees [[Phoenix, Arizona]] by car. While en route to Sam's [[California]] home, she parks along the road to sleep. A highway patrol officer awakens her and, suspicious of her agitated state, begins to follow her. When she trades her car for another one at a dealership, he notes the new vehicle's details. Marion returns to the road but, rather than drive in a heavy storm, decides to spend the night at the Bates Motel.  The proprietor, [[Norman Bates]] ([[Vince Vaughn]]), tells Marion he rarely has customers because of a new interstate nearby and mentions he lives with his mother in the house overlooking the motel. He invites Marion to have supper with him. She overhears Norman arguing with his mother about letting Marion in the house, and during the meal she angers him by suggesting he institutionalize his mother. He admits he would like to do so, but does not want to abandon her.\n\nMarion resolves to return to Phoenix to return the money. After calculating how she can repay the money she has spent, Marion dumps her notes down the toilet and begins to shower. An anonymous female figure enters the bathroom and stabs her to death. Finding the corpse, Norman is horrified. He cleans the bathroom and places Marion's body, wrapped in the shower curtain, and all her possessions &mdash; including the money &mdash; in the trunk of her car and sinks it in a nearby swamp...\n\nShortly afterward, Sam is contacted by both Marion's sister [[Lila Crane]] ([[Julianne Moore]]) and private detective Milton Arbogast ([[William H. Macy]]), who has been hired by Marion's employer to find her and recover the money. Arbogast traces Marion to the motel and questions Norman, who unconvincingly lies that Marion stayed for one night and left the following morning. He refuses to let Arbogast talk to his mother, claiming she is ill. Arbogast calls Lila to update her and tells her he will contact her again within an hour after he questions Norman's mother.\n\nArbogast enters Norman's house and at the top of the stairs is attacked by a figure who slashes his face three times with a knife, pushes him down the stairs, then stabs him to death. When Arbogast does not call Lila, she and Sam contact the local police. Deputy Sheriff Al Chambers ([[Philip Baker Hall]]) is perplexed to learn Arbogast saw a woman in a window, since Norman's mother died ten years ago. Norman confronts his mother and urges her to hide in the cellar. She rejects the idea and orders him out of her room, but against her will Norman carries her to the cellar.\n\nPosing as a married couple, Sam and Lila check into the motel and search Marion's room, where they find a scrap of paper in the toilet with \"$400,000\" written on it. While Sam distracts Norman, Lila sneaks into the house to search for his mother. Sam suggests to Norman that he killed Marion for the money so he could buy a new motel. Realizing Lila is not around, Norman knocks Sam unconscious with a golf club and rushes to the house. Lila sees him and hides in the cellar where she discovers the semi-preserved and [[mummy|mummified]] body of Norman's mother. Wearing his mother's clothes and a wig and carrying a knife, Norman enters and tries to attack Lila, but she is rescued by Sam.\n\nAfter Norman's arrest, [[forensic psychiatry|forensic psychiatrist]] Dr. Fred Richmond ([[Robert Forster]]) tells Sam and Lila that Norman's dead mother is living in Norman's [[Psyche (psychology)|psyche]] as an [[dissociative identity disorder|alternate personality]]. After the death of Norman's father, the pair lived as if they were the only people in the world. When his mother found a lover, Norman went over the edge with jealousy and murdered both of them. Consumed with guilt, he tried to \"erase the crime\" by bringing his mother back to life in his mind. He stole her corpse and preserved the body. When he is \"Mother\", he acts, talks, and dresses as she would. Norman imagined his mother would be as jealous of a woman to whom he might be attracted just as he was of his mother's lover, and so \"Mother\" kills any woman he has feelings for; when Norman regains consciousness, he believes that his mother has committed the crime, and covers up for her. It is implied that Norman is responsible for the unsolved disappearances of two young girls. Richmond concludes that the \"Mother\" personality has now taken complete control of Norman's mind.\n\nIn the final scene, Norman sits in a cell, thinking in \"Mother's\" voice. In a voiceover, \"Mother\" explains that she plans to prove to the authorities she is incapable of violence by refusing to swat a fly that has landed on her hand. The final shot shows Marion's car being recovered from the swamp, and then goes to end credits.\n\n==Television==\n{| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align: center\"\n|-\n! scope=\"col\" |Series\n! scope=\"col\" |Season\n! scope=\"col\" |Episodes\n! scope=\"col\" |First released\n! scope=\"col\" |Last released\n! scope=\"col\" |Showrunner(s)\n! scope=\"col\" |Network(s)\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | ''[[Bates Motel (TV series)|Bates Motel]]''\n| 5\n| 50\n| March 18, 2013 \n| April 24, 2017\n| TBA\n| [[A&E (TV channel)|A&E]]\n|-\n|}\n\n===''Bates Motel'' (2013\u20132017)===\n{{Main|Bates Motel (TV series)}}\nOn January 23, 2012, A&E announced that a television series called ''Bates Motel'' was in development at the network.

Both had deceased, domineering mothers, and had sealed off one room of their house as a shrine to their mother, and both dressed in women's clothing. However, there are many differences between Bates and Ed Gein. Among others, Gein would not be strictly considered a serial killer, having officially killed \"only\" two people.<ref>{{Harvnb|Reavill|2007|p=228}} \"With only two confirmed kills, Ed did not technically qualify as a serial killer (the traditional minimum requirement was three\"</ref> [[Peggy Robertson]], Hitchcock's production assistant, read [[Anthony Boucher]]'s positive review of the Bloch novel and decided to show the book to Hitchcock, even though readers at Hitchcock's home studio [[Paramount Pictures]] rejected its premise for a film. Hitchcock acquired rights to the novel for $9,500.<ref name=\"Leigh6\">Leigh, p. 6</ref> He reportedly ordered Robertson to buy up copies to keep the novel's surprises for the film.<ref>{{Harvnb|Rebello|1990|pp=19\u201320}}</ref> Hitchcock chose to film ''Psycho'' to recover from two aborted projects with Paramount: ''Flamingo Feather'' and ''No Bail for the Judge''. Hitchcock also faced genre competitors whose works were critically compared to his own and so wanted to film new material. The director also disliked stars' salary demands and trusted only a few people to choose prospective material, including Robertson.<ref>{{Harvnb|Rebello|1990|pp=18\u201319}}</ref>\n\nParamount executives did not want to produce the film and refused to provide the budget that Hitchcock received from them for previous films with the studio.<ref name=\"Rebello23\">{{Harvnb|Rebello|1990|p=23}}</ref> Hitchcock decided to plan for ''Psycho'' to be filmed quickly and inexpensively, similar to an episode of his ongoing television series ''[[Alfred Hitchcock Presents]]'', and hired the television series crew as Shamley Productions. He proposed this cost-conscious approach to Paramount but executives again refused to finance the film, telling him their sound stages were occupied or booked even though production was known to be in a slump. Hitchcock countered with the offer to finance the film personally and to film it at Universal-International if Paramount would distribute. He also deferred his director's fee of $250,000 for a 60% ownership of the film negative. This offer was finally accepted. Hitchcock also experienced resistance from producer Herbert Coleman and Shamley Productions executive [[Joan Harrison (screenwriter)|Joan Harrison]], who did not think the film would be a success.<ref>{{Harvnb|Rebello|1990|pp=26\u201329}}</ref>\n\nHitchcock hired writer James Cavanaugh to write a draft of the screenplay. Unsatisfied with Cavanaugh's screenplay, Hitchcock then hired up-and-coming writer [[Joseph Stefano]] to adapt the novel. The film began shooting in December 1959 and would go on to last about a month. It was filmed mostly on the backlot of Universal and in various sound stages. During shooting, Hitchcock was forced to uncharacteristically do retakes for some scenes. The final shot in the shower scene, which starts with an extreme close-up on Marion's eye and pulls up and out, proved very difficult for Leigh, since the water splashing in her face made her want to blink, and the cameraman had trouble as well since he had to manually focus while moving the camera. Retakes were also required for the opening scene, since Hitchcock felt that Leigh and Gavin were not passionate enough.<ref>Leigh, p. 55</ref> Leigh had trouble saying \"Not inordinately\" for the real estate office scene, requiring additional retakes.<ref>Leigh, p. 59</ref> Lastly, the scene in which the mother is discovered required complicated coordination of the chair turning around, Miles hitting the light bulb, and a [[lens flare]], which proved to be the sticking point. Hitchcock forced retakes until all three elements were to his satisfaction.<ref>Leigh, pp. 87\u201388</ref> The famous shower scene took a week to complete and took up a third of Janet Leigh's shooting time. ''Psycho'' was released on June 16, 1960 to mixed critical reception and financial success, making thirty-two million dollars in its theatrical run. The film received four Academy Award nominations.\n\nIn 1982, author Robert Bloch published his novel ''Psycho II'', which satirized Hollywood slasher films. Upset by this, Universal decided to make their own version that differed from Bloch's work.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://mgpfeff.home.sprynet.com/leming_interview1.html | title=Interviews - From ''Psycho'' to ''Asylum'': The Horror Films of Robert Bloch | work=The Unofficial Robert Bloch Website | accessdate=2009-08-15}}</ref> Originally, the film was intended as a [[TV movie|made-for-cable]] production.<ref name=boys>[http://retroslashers.net/blog/a-boys-best-friend-pt2-psycho-2-1983/ A Boy's Best Friend - Psycho 2 - Retroslashers.net] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20130112034832/http://retroslashers.net/blog/a-boys-best-friend-pt2-psycho-2-1983/ |date=2013-01-12 }}</ref> [[Anthony Perkins]] originally turned down the offer to reprise the role of [[Norman Bates]], but when the studio became interested in others (including [[Christopher Walken]]), Perkins quickly accepted.<ref name=film>[http://www.film.com/movies/psycho-ii/story/erics-time-capsule-psycho-ii/28477842 Eric's Time Capsule: Psycho II (June 3, 1983) - Film.com]</ref> The studio also wanted [[Jamie Lee Curtis]] (daughter of ''Psycho'' star [[Janet Leigh]]) to play the role of Mary Loomis.<ref name=film/> Director [[Richard Franklin (director)|Richard Franklin]] was hired to direct ''Psycho II'' because he was a Hitchcock student and even visited him on the set of ''[[Topaz (1969 film)|Topaz]]'', and because a year earlier, Franklin made a film called ''[[Roadgames]]'' starring Jamie Lee Curtis which was influenced by Hitchcock's 1954 film ''[[Rear Window]]''. Franklin hired writer [[Tom Holland (director)|Tom Holland]] to write the screenplay after Franklin had seen ''The Beast Within'', which Holland had written. Holland stated: \"I approached it with more trepidation because I was doing a sequel to ''Psycho'' and I had an overwhelming respect for Hitchcock. You didn't want to mess it up, you really had almost a moral obligation to make something that stayed true to the original and yet updated it the same time. It really was the next step, what happens when Norman gets out\". The assistant director of the original ''[[Psycho (1960 film)|Psycho]]'', [[Hilton A. Green]], was contacted and asked if he wanted to produce the film. Green, fearing that Hitchcock may not have approved of sequels to his films, called Hitchcock's daughter [[Patricia Hitchcock]] and asked what she thought of the film. Patricia Hitchcock gave her blessing to the film, saying that her father would have loved it. ''Psycho II'' was filmed at [[Universal Studios]] in [[Universal City, California]] on Stage 24 from June 30, 1982 to August 1982.<ref name=boys/>\n\nThe Bates house set was still standing from 1960, but the motel had to be reconstructed.<ref name=boys/> According to [[Richard Franklin (director)|Richard Franklin]], filming lasted 32 days. The film was made much like the first film; it was mostly shot on the backlot of Universal and on a number of sound stages. Several props and set pieces from the original film were found by set designers [[John W. Corso]] and Julie Fletcher. The town of Fairvale (seen when Lila Loomis is tailed by Dr. Raymond) is actually [[Courthouse Square]], which is located on the Universal Studios backlot in [[California]]. Both Franklin and Holland wanted the film to be a tribute to Hitchcock and the original film; to accomplish this, they added in various in jokes such as the scene when Mary and Norman first go into Norman's mother's room, before they turn the lights on; one can see Alfred Hitchcock's silhouette on the wall to the far right. Franklin also repeated various shots from the original film such as the shot where Norman walks into the kitchen and sets his jacket down on the chair. Perkins had difficulty working with actress [[Meg Tilly]] due to Tilly never seeing the original film and not being aware of the significance of Perkins' comeback role. Midway through production, Perkins suggested that Tilly be replaced even though half of her scenes had been shot. The ending of the film was kept secret during production. The final pages of the shooting script with the ending on it weren't distributed to cast and crew until the last day of filming. The iconic last shot of the movie with Norman standing in front of the house was used as a Christmas card for various crew members. When Universal presented concept art for the one-sheet film poster, director Franklin wasn't pleased with it. It was editor Andrew London who came up with the idea of using the Christmas card photo as the film poster and also came up with the tagline: \"It's 22 years later and Norman Bates is coming home\". When the film opened on June 3, 1983, it earned $8,310,244 in its opening weekend and went on to gross about $34,725,000, making it one of the top hits of the year, just behind ''[[Return of the Jedi]]''.<ref name=boys/>\n\n''Psycho II'' was generally received well by the public and critics and was a surprise box office success. However, film critics [[Gene Siskel]] and [[Roger Ebert]] both gave the film thumbs down on ''[[At the Movies (1982\u20131990 TV series)|At the Movies]]'', specifically for its failure to live up to the original. \"I think the ghost of the original,\" said Siskel, \"obviously hangs over this movie, and it's too bad because it's a nicely made picture.\" Ebert wrote of the film: \"If you've seen ''Psycho'' a dozen times and can recite the shots in the shower scene by heart, ''Psycho II'' is just not going to do it for you. But if you can accept this 1983 movie on its own terms, as a fresh start, and put your memories of Hitchcock on hold, then ''Psycho II'' begins to work. It's too heavy on plot and too willing to cheat about its plot to be really successful, but it does have its moments, and it's better than your average, run-of-the-mill slasher movie.\"<ref name=\"ebert\">{{Cite news|author=Ebert, Roger |authorlink=Roger Ebert |title=Psycho (1960) |work=Great Movies |publisher=rogerebert.com |date=1998-12-06 |url= http://rogerebert.suntimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/19981206/REVIEWS08/401010353/1023|accessdate=2006-12-01}}</ref> In the British magazine ''[[Empire (magazine)|Empire]]'', film critic [[Kim Newman]] gave the film three out of five stars, calling ''Psycho II'' \"a smart, darkly-comic thriller with some imaginative twists\", writing \" The wittiest dark joke is that the entire world ''wants'' Norman to be mad, and \u2018normality\u2019 can only be restored if he\u2019s got a mummified mother in the window and is ready to kill again.\"<ref>{{cite web|last=Newman|first=Kim|title=Empire's Psycho II Movie Review|url=https://www.empireonline.com/reviews/reviewcomplete.asp?FID=134907|publisher=Empire|accessdate=25 November 2012}}</ref>\n\nWith the surprise financial and critical success of ''Psycho II'', Universal began development on a second sequel. Writer [[Charles Edward Pogue]] was hired to write the screenplay. In Pogue's first draft of the film, it was Duane who was the killer and had intentionally come to the Bates Motel because he was obsessed with Norman. Maureen was a neurotic psychologist who had come to the motel to replace Dr. Raymond from the previous film. Pogue had intended to cast original victim [[Janet Leigh]] in the role. Universal rejected these ideas, arguing that Bates had to be the killer and Leigh was wrong for the film. However, Maureen's actions remained virtually unchanged; her character was merely changed to a young nun. After the second draft of the screenplay was completed, it was sent to Perkins as an acting job. After Perkins read the script, he wanted to direct the film, saying he would do it for nothing. Universal agreed to this. When the film went into pre-production, Anthony Perkins asked ''Psycho II'' director [[Richard Franklin (director)|Richard Franklin]] to co-direct the film with him; however Franklin declined. Filming for ''Psycho III'' began in June 1985. Perkins' main inspiration for the style of this film came from the movie ''[[Blood Simple]]'' directed by the [[Coen brothers]]. Before production began, he even took the entire cast and crew to a screening of the film. Like the two previous films, it was mostly shot on the backlot of Universal and in a number of sound stages. Despite ''Psycho III'' being Perkins' film directorial debut, the cast and crew have said in interviews that he was enjoyable to work with. [[Lee Garlington]], who played the waitress Myrna, stated: \"I have never to this date met a director who worked equally well with both the cast and crew. He was excited to be doing it, I adored him\". During filming, actor [[Jeff Fahey]] suffered an on-set injury. When filming the scene where Norman is hitting Duke with the guitar, Anthony Perkins actually hit Jeff Fahey so hard that it cut his head open and he had to get six stitches. A shot of Fahey's actual injury was used in the final film. Universal originally wanted to release the film in February 1986 but the release was moved to July 2, 1986 due to various re-shoots that included the ending. ''Psycho III'' was released on July 2, 1986 to a mixed response from critics and financial failure. It earned $3,238,400 in its opening weekend and went on to gross about $14,481,606 at the domestic box office, becoming the lowest-grossing theatrical film of the ''Psycho'' movie franchise.<ref name=\"mojo-p3\">{{cite web |url= https://boxofficemojo.com/movies/?id=psycho3.htm |title= Psycho III |website = [[Box Office Mojo]] |access-date= 2011-04-17 }}</ref>\n\nRoger Ebert gave the film three out of five stars, saying: \"Any movie named \"Psycho III\" is going to be compared to the Hitchcock original, but Perkins isn't an imitator. He has his own agenda. He has lived with Norman Bates all these years, and he has some ideas about him, and although the movie doesn't apologize for Norman, it does pity him. For the first time, I was able to see that the true horror in the \"Psycho\" movies isn't what Norman does - but the fact that he is compelled to do it.\" Vincent Canby of ''The New York Times'' said: \"It has a cast of talented, self-effacing actors, who don't upstage the material, and an efficient screenplay by Charles Edward Pogue, who doesn't beat you over the head to prove that he has a sense of humor.\" Ken Hanke of Mountain Xpress called the film a \"superior horror sequel stylishly made by star Anthony Perkins\". Dave Kehr of ''The Chicago Reader'' said: \"Perkins tries to imitate Hitchcock's visual style, but most of the film is made without concern for style of any kind, unless it's the bludgeoning nonstyle of Friday the 13th.\" ''Variety'' called the film \"dependent almost entirely upon self-referential incidents and attitudes for its effect, and it eventually becomes wearying.\"\n\nWith the financial failure of ''Psycho III'', Universal decided to continue the ''Psycho'' franchise as a television series, taking inspiration from the ''[[Friday the 13th (TV series)|Friday the 13th]]'' and ''[[Freddy's Nightmares|A Nightmare on Elm Street]]'' TV series. In this televised [[Spin-off (media)|spin-off]] of ''Psycho'', Norman Bates is portrayed by [[Kurt Paul]], who previously stood in as a [[stunt double]] for Anthony Perkins in ''Psycho II'' and ''Psycho III''. Perkins declined involvement in the project and even heavily boycotted it. The film was made as a [[pilot episode|pilot]] for a weekly anthology television series, but the series was never picked up.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0092622/trivia|title=Trivia for Bates Motel|publisher=imdb.com|accessdate=2011-04-17}}</ref> Thus, Universal decided to air the pilot as a made-for-TV film over the [[Independence Day (United States)|4th of July]] weekend. The film received mostly negative reviews and low Nielson ratings.\n\nA year after ''[[Bates Motel (film)|Bates Motel]]'' aired, production on ''[[Psycho IV: The Beginning]]'' began. Perkins wanted to direct the film and even came up with a pitch for the film along with ''Psycho III'' screenwriter Charles Edward Pogue; however ''Psycho III'' was a critical and financial failure so Universal rejected that idea and [[Mick Garris]] was brought in.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.brightlightsfilm.com/54/psychoiv.php |title=Who Owns Norman Bates? |last1= |first1= |last2= |first2= |date=November 2006 |work= |publisher=Bright Lights Film Journal |accessdate=17 October 2011 }}</ref> [[Joseph Stefano]] was the screenwriter of the original film and was brought back to write the fourth film. He had disliked the two films between I and IV, feeling that they were too commercial and catered to the conventions of slasher movies. In an interview, Stefano stated \"Gearing up for ''Psycho IV'', I decided to ignore the two sequels \u2013 like the business in II about Norman\u2019s mother.\"<ref>[http://cinefantastiqueonline.com/2008/09/interview-psycho-screenwriter-joseph-stefano/ Interview: Psycho Screenwriter Joseph Stefano By Steve Biodrowski \u2022 September 16, 2008]</ref>\n\nActress [[Olivia Hussey]] was directly offered the role of Mrs. Bates.

In the documentary ''[[The Psycho Legacy]]'', Thomas stated: \"Looking back on it now, he knew he had to have this conversation with me but I don't think that he was really into it.

Director Mick Garris has stated in numerous interviews that he had some creative control issues with Perkins. \"He would get into long, drawn-out discussions in front of the crew, testing his director, making sure choices were not made \"because it looks good\", and seeing how deep the understanding of the story and process were. He could be very forceful, just shy of bullying, but also really appreciated helpful direction. I would have to say he was the most difficult and challenging actor I've ever worked with, but he ended up going on and on about how happy he was with the film. That was gratifying\", Garris says.<ref>[http://www.thepsychomovies.com/films/psycho4/mgarris.html Interview with Director Mick Garris at \"The Psycho Movies\"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120401083024/http://www.thepsychomovies.com/films/psycho4/mgarris.html |date=2012-04-01 }}</ref>\n\n''Psycho IV: The Beginning'' was filmed at [[Universal Studios Florida]] in [[Orlando, Florida]] from June 4 to July 13, 1990. The facade of the Bates Motel and the Bates mansion were re-created at the theme park. The production was originally to be filmed before the opening of the park but due to delays and the studio's desire to have a high-profile production on the lot, the film was shot while the park was open. This led to tourists being able to watch the filming of several scenes at the motel and house on the back lot.\n\nThe film received mixed reviews when first broadcast on Showtime. Henry Stewart of ''L Magazine'' said: \"Garris evinces high-grade professionalism, but his comic-book approximations of real emotions\u2014like desire, madness and murderlust\u2014feel empty. Hitchcock this most certainly ain't.\"<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.thelmagazine.com/newyork/psycho-the-book-the-sequels/Content?oid=1794136 |title=Psycho, the Book, the Sequels |author=Mark Asch and Henry Stewart |date= |work= |publisher=The L Magazine |accessdate=17 October 2011 }}</ref> Ninja Dixon.com stated: \"This is a good TV movie, way better than {{sic|it's}} reputation, and continues the tradition of great acting in the series.\"<ref>{{cite web |url=http://ninjadixon.blogspot.com/2009/08/psycho-iv-beginning-1990.html |title=Psycho IV: The Beginning (1990) |author=Ninja Dixon |date=August 6, 2009 |work= |publisher= |accessdate=17 October 2011 }}</ref> Cult Reviews.com said: \"The film is shot well, the fire sequence, by Rodney Charters, is particularly stunning.

Some changes are pervasive: as the film opens, it is made clear that it is set in the late 1990s, so minor changes are made throughout the dialogue to reflect the new timeframe. For example, all the references to money are updated (how much Marion Crane steals, how much a car costs, how much a hotel room costs), as are references to terms from the original script like \"[[aspic]]\" that would seem [[Anachronism|anachronistic]] in the new setting.\n\nAccording to Van Sant, in the original the only fully fleshed-out character was [[Norman Bates]]; the other major characters were more iconic, purposely written and portrayed to advance the plot. Van Sant relied upon his main cast more to flesh out and make consistent their character's motivations and worked with them to determine to what degree their characters were similar to the originals. William H. Macy chose to stay true to the original, while others, such as Vaughn and Julianne Moore, interpreted the dialogue and scenes from the original film differently. Moore's version of Lila Crane was much more aggressive than the one portrayed by [[Vera Miles]], and there are differences in Marion Crane's evolving attitudes about the money she stole.\n\nThe [[cinematography]] and [[cinematic techniques]] were consistent between the two films in many memorable scenes, including the shower scene, scenes of the mother, scenes of the swamp, and the scene of Arbogast on the staircase, but other scenes changed significantly, particularly the climax, and the Dr. Simon monologue at the end, which was much shorter. Van Sant's comments from the commentary track attributes many of the updates to the need to make the film more accessible to a new audience.\n\nThe film earned $37,141,130 at the box office, $21,456,130 of which came from North America.<ref name=\"mojo-p1998\">{{mojo title|id=psycho98|title=Psycho (1998)}}</ref> Estimates of the production budget range from $20 million<ref>[https://www.the-numbers.com/movies/1998/PSYCH.php ''Psych'' (1998)] from The Numbers</ref> to $60 million;<ref name=\"mojo-p1998\"/> while promoting his 2002 film ''[[Gerry (2002 film)|Gerry]]'', Van Sant said he thought the producers \"broke even\" financially.<ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.webwombat.com.au/entertainment/movies/gus-van-sant-int.htm| title=Gus Vant Sant: Exclusive Interview| last=Morris| first=Clint| publisher=Web Wombat| accessdate=2009-03-30}}</ref>\n\nThis version of ''Psycho'' received mostly negative reviews; it was awarded two [[Golden Raspberry Award]]s, for [[Golden Raspberry Award for Worst Prequel, Remake, Rip-off or Sequel|Worst Remake or Sequel]] and [[Golden Raspberry Award for Worst Director|Worst Director]] for Gus Van Sant, while Anne Heche was nominated as [[Golden Raspberry Award for Worst Actress|Worst Actress]]. [[Camille Paglia]] commented that the only reason to watch it was \"to see Anne Heche being assassinated\", but that \"it should have been a much more important work and event than it was.\"<ref>{{cite web|last=Sragow|first=Michael|title=The Savage id|url=http://www.salon.com/1999/08/13/hitchcock_paglia/|publisher=Salon|accessdate=25 November 2012|date=13 August 1999}}</ref> A number of critics and writers viewed Van Sant's version more as an experiment in [[shot-for-shot]] remakes. Many people refer to this film as a duplicate of the [[Psycho (1960 film)|1960 film]] rather than a remake. Film critic [[Roger Ebert]] wrote that the film \"demonstrates that a shot-by-shot remake is pointless; genius apparently resides between or beneath the shots, or in chemistry that cannot be timed or counted.\"<ref>{{cite news | url=http://rogerebert.suntimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/19981206/REVIEWS/812060301/1023 | title=Review of Psycho (1998 film) | first=Roger | last=Ebert | date=1998-12-06 | authorlink=Roger Ebert | accessdate=2007-11-03 | work=Chicago Sun-Times}}</ref> Screenwriter [[Joseph Stefano]], who worked on the 1960 version, thought that although she spoke the same lines, Anne Heche portrays Marion Crane as an entirely different character.<ref>{{cite news | title=Psycho Analysis: An Interview With Screenwriter Joseph Stefano | url=http://www.austinchronicle.com/gyrobase/Issue/story?oid=oid%3A74285 | publisher=[[The Austin Chronicle]] | date=1999-10-15 | accessdate=2007-11-03}}</ref> Even Van Sant admitted that it was an experiment that proved that no one can really copy a film exactly the same way as the original.<ref>{{cite news | title=The odd world of Gus Van Sant | url=http://www.iht.com/articles/2005/07/14/news/gus.php | publisher=[[International Herald Tribune]] | date=2005-07-15 | accessdate=2007-11-03}}</ref> [[Janet Maslin]] gave the film a positive review, calling it an \"artful, good-looking remake (a modest term, but it beats plagiarism) that shrewdly revitalizes the aspects of the real ''Psycho'' (1960) that it follows most faithfully but seldom diverges seriously or successfully from one of the cinema's most brilliant blueprints\"; she noted that the \"absence of anything like [[Anthony Perkins]]'s sensational performance with that vitally birdlike presence and sneaky way with a [[Double entendre|double-entendre]] (\"A boy's best friend is his mother\") is the new film's greatest weakness.\"<ref>{{cite news| url=https://movies.nytimes.com/movie/review?res=9D0DE7DD1E3BF936A35751C1A96E958260| title=The Mama's Boy, His Motel Guest And That Shower| last=Maslin| first=Janet| authorlink=Janet Maslin| publisher=[[The New York Times]]| date=December 5, 1998| accessdate=2009-03-30}}</ref> Critic [[Leonard Maltin]] gave the film a rating of one out of four stars, or \"BOMB\" compared to the four stars he gave the original.

''[[Psycho (1998 film)|Psycho]]'' (1998), a shot-for-shot [[remake]] of the first film is not a sequel since it retells the same events as the original film, but set in 1998. There are also some continuity problems in ''Psycho IV: The Beginning'' that have to do with some of the past events explored in ''Psycho'', ''Psycho II'', and ''Psycho III''. Reflecting on the continuity issues, Robert Price writes \"It seems that all the different Psychos drift into and out of one another. There is no real sequence. All are variant versions of the same myth. The deep conflict being rehearsed and resolved in these movies is that of the [[Oedipus complex|Oedipal complex]].\"\n\n==Home media==\n[[File:Psycho DVD set.JPG|thumb|right|200px|2003 DVD box set of the first four main films ([[United Kingdom|UK]]).]]\n''[[Psycho (1960 film)|Psycho]]'', ''[[Psycho II (film)|Psycho II]]'', ''[[Psycho III]]'', ''[[Psycho IV: The Beginning]]'', the ''[[Psycho (1998 film)|Psycho]]'' remake and ''[[Bates Motel (film)|Bates Motel]]'' have been released on [[VHS]].

All three sequels have been nominated for Saturn Awards. ''[[Psycho II (film)|Psycho II]]'' received a nomination for Best Screenplay for writer [[Tom Holland (director)|Tom Holland]]. ''[[Psycho III]]'' was nominated for Best Horror Film. ''[[Psycho IV: The Beginning]]'' was nominated for Best Genre Television Series.\n\n===Legacy===\n''[[Psycho (1960 film)|Psycho]]'' has become one of the most recognizable films ever made. The shower scene alone has become one of the most iconic cut scenes in cinematic history. ''Psycho'' is frequently referenced, given homage to or spoofed in television shows such as ''[[The Simpsons]]'', ''[[South Park]]'', ''[[American Dad!]]'', ''[[The Mary Tyler Moore Show]]'' and more. Films such as ''[[Scream 2]]'', ''[[Charlie and the Chocolate Factory (film)|Charlie and the Chocolate Factory]]'', ''[[Throw Momma from the Train]]'', ''[[Scary Movie]]'' and more have referenced the film. Many critics and filmmakers have cited ''Psycho'' as the film that modernized the horror genre. Horror writer David. J. Schow stated (in ''[[The Psycho Legacy]]'') \"It brought the idea that the killer in a horror film was not a mutant, didn't have dents in his head; he could look like that nice young boy from next door\". The film also brought in a new level of acceptable violence and sexuality in movies. Both [[Anthony Perkins]] and [[Janet Leigh]] spent the rest of their careers being typecasted by the film. Even [[Alfred Hitchcock]]'s films began to decline in critical and financial popularity after the release of ''Psycho''. Hitchcock film scholars argue that for the rest of his career, Hitchcock's films were constantly being compared to ''Psycho''. The \"Psycho\" films still maintain a very large fanbase. Various websites dedicated to the franchise such as ''The Psycho Movies.com'' have appeared on the Internet. Books detailing the making and impact of the film such as ''Alfred Hitchcock and The Making of Psycho'', ''The Moment of Psycho'', Janet Leigh's ''Psycho: Behind The Scenes of the Classic Thriller'' have been published over the years. Two retrospective documentaries have been released detailing the making of all four films including ''The Making of Psycho'' (1997) and ''[[The Psycho Legacy]]'' (2010). The film also spawned the show ''[[Alfred Hitchcock: The Art of Making Movies]]'' at [[Universal Studios Florida]], with part of the show detailing how the shower scene was filmed. In 1992, ''Psycho'' was added to the [[National Film Registry]] by the [[Library of Congress]].\n\nA musical stage adaptation was performed January-February 2019 at PULP Black Box Theatre in Atlanta, GA. <ref>https://www.facebook.com/events/1973956552682770/</ref>\n\n==Other media and merchandise==\n\nVarious ''Psycho'' related merchandise has been sold ever since the release of the original film. Merchandise includes T-shirts, posters, DVDs, books, stationery, shot glasses, shower curtains, action figures, model house kits, pens and more. Much of the merchandise is related to the fictional Bates Motel where items commonly found in an actual motel have the Bates Motel logo on them. A Bates Motel light up sign was released in 2009. To coincide with the 50th anniversary of the release of the original film, a Psycho house model kit was released in the U.S. Props from all the films are also sold occasionally on [[eBay]]. The original one sheet poster for ''[[Psycho (1960 film)|Psycho]]'' is worth around $3000 in mint condition. The original one sheets for ''[[Psycho II (film)|Psycho II]]'', ''[[Psycho III]]'' and ''[[Psycho IV: The Beginning]]'' are worth around $50 each.\n\n===Graphic novels===\nIn 1992, a series of [[graphic novel]]s based on the original ''[[Psycho (1960 film)|Psycho]]'' was published by the Innovation Comics group. Today, the novels are out of print and are very rare to find.{{citation needed|date=August 2016}}\n\n===The ''Psycho'' House and Bates Motel sets===\nThe Bates House and Motel were constructed on the backlot at [[Universal Studios Hollywood|Universal City Studios]] in 1959 for the production of ''[[Psycho (1960 film)|Psycho]]''. It has been said that the house, designed by art directors [[Joseph Hurley (art director)|Joseph Hurley]] and [[Robert Clatworthy (art director)|Robert Clathworthy]], was loosely based on an [[Edward Hopper]] painting called \"House by the Railroad\". The house and motel sets were actually empty shells, also known as facades. When the house was originally built, there was no right side of the house, since the right side is never seen on camera in the original ''Psycho'' film. Interiors of the Bates house and motel were constructed on Sound stage 18-A at Universal, just a short walk from the actual exterior locations making production convenient for all involved. After production had wrapped on ''Psycho'', the house was featured in several television productions including ''[[The Virginian (TV series)|The Virginian]]'' and ''[[Thriller (American TV series)|Boris Karloff's Thriller]]''.\n\nIn 1964, Universal Studios opened its patented [[Studio Tour|Studio Tram Tour]]. The right side of the house was then added and the set was unceremoniously dubbed \"The Psycho House\". The house and even the motel went on to appear in several shows such as ''[[Night Gallery]]'', ''[[The Hardy Boys/Nancy Drew Mysteries]]'' and even in films such as ''[[Invitation to a Gunfighter]]'' and ''[[Modern Problems]]''. The motel was torn down in 1979 and the house was moved to an alternate location on the backlot to accommodate the new tour. In 1982, Richard Franklin and Hilton A. Green announced plans to film ''[[Psycho II (film)|Psycho II]]''. The house was then moved to a location that best matched the original hill and only about 40 feet of the motel was actually re-built. The rest of the motel in the film was a matte painting. TV shows during the '80s promoted the Universal Tour and prominently featured the Psycho House including ''[[Amazing Stories (1985 TV series)|Amazing Stories]]'', ''[[Knight Rider (1982 TV series)|Knight Rider]]'' and ''[[Diff'rent Strokes]]''.\n\nIn 1985, the Bates Motel was fully re-built for the filming of ''[[Psycho III]]''. In 1987, the NBC-TV network announced plans for the TV pilot ''[[Bates Motel (film)|Bates Motel]]''. The motel in the film was re-modeled to look very Spanish like. This version of the set remained until 1994 when the new renovations were taken away and the motel was put back to look the way it did in the original Psycho. An episode of ''[[Murder, She Wrote]]'' called \"Incident in Lot 7\" in 1992 featured the Psycho House and Bates Motel as key locations in the popular [[Angela Lansbury]] series.\n\nIn 1988, plans for ''[[Psycho IV: The Beginning]]'' were underway at Universal. Plans to shoot the movie in Orlando, Florida were set into motion and the film crew constructed a full-scale replica of the Bates Motel and Psycho House at the soon-to-be built [[Universal Studios Florida]]. The final dressing and painting was done by the Psycho IV art department crew in 1990, but the house and motel was fully built in 1988 long before the production team was assembled for the project. After production wrapped, the sets were left as attractions at the park until 1999 when it was torn down to make room for another attraction.\n\nIn 1998, the Psycho House in California was renovated to preserve the set. All of the rotting wood was replaced and the set had a new paint job. That same year, plans to remake ''Psycho'' were announced. It was originally announced that Gus Van Sant was going to be using the original house and motel sets. However, the production team built a new house directly in front of the old one, and the motel was updated to look like it was from the 1960s. The new house was moved next to the original house and remained there for about three years after production. In 2003, due to popular demand, the remake's house was torn down and the motel was restored to the original way once again. To this day, the house and motel are still standing on the backlot of Universal and continue to be major tourist attractions. The [[Studio Tour|tram tour]] features an actor playing Norman Bates coming out of cabin 1 with a body, putting it in the trunk of a car and then wielding a large knife at the tourists as the tram drives away.\n\n===''24 Hour Psycho''===\nAn art installation, ''[[24 Hour Psycho]]'', created by artist [[Douglas Gordon]] in 1993, and later installed in the [[Museum of Modern Art]] in New York, consists of a silent screening of ''Psycho'', slowed down to two frames per second (from the usual 24), so that it lasts 24 hours rather than 109 minutes. ''24 Hour Psycho'' is featured prominently in [[Don DeLillo]]'s 2010 novel ''[[Point Omega]]''.\n\n===''The Psycho Legacy'' (2010)===\n{{Main|The Psycho Legacy}}\nIn 2010, a [[direct-to-video|direct-to-DVD]] documentary was released called ''The Psycho Legacy''. It included interviews with cast and crew from all four Psycho films. It also featured interviews with current horror filmmakers who are fans of the series. The documentary was written, produced and directed by horror journalist Robert Galluzzo. Galluzo made the documentary because of the lack of information on the sequels and also to celebrate the 50th anniversary of the release of the original film. The documentary discussed the impact and legacy of the original ''[[Psycho (1960 film)|Psycho]]'' and the production stories of ''[[Psycho II (film)|Psycho II]]'', ''[[Psycho III]]'' and ''[[Psycho IV: The Beginning]]''. To the surprise of some critics and fans, the failed TV pilot ''[[Bates Motel (film)|Bates Motel]]'' and the [[Gus Van Sant]] [[Psycho (1998 film)|remake]] were not discussed in the documentary, however originally in the deleted scenes section on the DVD two short segments on the two films were supposed to be on there, however for unknown reasons they were left off of the DVD when it was released. The documentary sold well, received mostly positive reviews and garnered new interest in the series from horror fans.\n\n===''Hitchcock'' (2012)===\n{{Main|Hitchcock (film)}}\nOn April 13, 2012, production started on a film adaptation of [[Stephen Rebello]]'s non-fiction book ''[[Alfred Hitchcock and the Making of Psycho]]'', which follows the complex relationship between [[Alfred Hitchcock]] and wife [[Alma Reville]] during the filming of ''[[Psycho (1960 film)|Psycho]]'' in 1959. The film is directed by [[Sacha Gervasi]] and stars [[Anthony Hopkins]] as director Alfred Hitchcock, Helen Mirren as his wife [[Alma Reville]], [[Scarlett Johansson]] as [[Janet Leigh]], [[Jessica Biel]] as [[Vera Miles]], and [[James D'Arcy]] as [[Anthony Perkins]]. Produced by [[The Montecito Picture Company]] and distributed by [[Fox Searchlight Pictures]], the film was released on November 23, 2012 in selected cities with a worldwide release on December 14, 2012. The film has received mixed reviews from critics and moderate box office returns, with a worldwide gross of $5,337,378 as of January 3, 2013.\n\n===2017 documentary: \"78/52\"===\n\nA documentary on the production of ''Psycho'' was released on Oct 13, 2017 by director Alexandre O. Philippe running 91 minutes. The cast of participants included Guillermo del Toro, Peter Bogdanovich, Bret Easton Ellis, Jamie Lee Curtis, Karyn Kusama, Eli Roth, Oz Perkins, Leigh Whannell, Walter Murch, Danny Elfman, Elijah Wood, Richard Stanley, and Neil Marshall.<ref>. {{cite web | date = January 24, 2017 | author = Owen Gleiberman | url = https://variety.com/2017/film/reviews/7852-review-psycho-1201966555/ | title = Film Review: \u201878/52: Hitchcock\u2019s Shower Scene\u2019 | work = [[Variety (magazine)|Variety Magazine]] }}</ref>\n\n==Notes==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==References==\n* [[Janet Leigh|Leigh, Janet]]; Nickens, Christopher (1995).
