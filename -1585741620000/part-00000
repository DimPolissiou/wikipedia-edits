The [[4th Canadian (Armoured) Division]] attacked the German-held town of [[Friesoythe]] and one of its [[battalion]]s, [[Argyll and Sutherland Highlanders of Canada (Princess Louise's)|The Argyll and Sutherland Highlanders of Canada]], captured it.\n\nDuring the fighting the battalion's commander was killed by a German soldier, but it was incorrectly rumoured that he had been killed by a civilian. Under this mistaken belief, the division's commander, [[Major General|Major-General]] [[Christopher Vokes]], ordered that the town be razed in [[Reprisal|retaliation]] and it was substantially destroyed. Twenty German civilians died in Friesoythe and the surrounding area during the two days of fighting and its aftermath. Similar, if usually less extreme, events occurred elsewhere in Germany as the Allies advanced in the closing weeks of the war.\n\nThe rubble of the town was used to fill craters in local roads to make them passable for the division's tanks and heavy vehicles. A few days earlier, the division had destroyed the centre of [[S\u00f6gel]] in another reprisal and also used the rubble to make the roads passable. Little official notice was taken of the incident and the [[Official History of the Canadian Army in the Second World War|Canadian Army official history]] glosses over it. It is covered in the regimental histories of the units involved and several accounts of the campaign. Forty years later, Vokes wrote in his autobiography that he had \"no great remorse over the elimination of Friesoythe\".\n\n==Context==\n===Allied tactics===\nBy September 1944, the [[Allies of World War II|Western Allies]] had reached [[Nazi Germany|Germany's]] western border,{{sfn|Ambrose|1997|p=117}} and by the end of October had [[Battle of Aachen|captured Aachen]], the first major German city to fall to them.{{sfn|Hastings|2004|pp=106\u2013107}} Over the following six months they overran much of western Germany. In November the [[Supreme Headquarters Allied Expeditionary Force]] (SHAEF) publicly stated that the forces of the Western Allies would strictly adhere to international law in respect of their treatment of civilians.{{sfn|Briddiscombe|1998|p=256}} However, SHAEF's manual ''Combating the Guerrilla'' stated that there were circumstances where commanders could take \"stern measures\" against civilians as a [[reprisal|rapid response]] to guerrilla attacks, although this was in breach of the [[Hague Conventions of 1899 and 1907|Hague Conventions]].{{sfn|Briddiscombe|1998|p=256}}\n\nThe frequency and nature of retaliatory actions differed between national contingents within the Western Allied forces.{{sfn|Briddiscombe|1998|p=257}} Following SHAEF's policy, [[United States Army]] forces destroyed German buildings on several occasions, sometimes entire villages, and took other measures against German civilians. French troops took a similar, if more rigorous, approach to that of the Americans.{{sfn|Briddiscombe|1998|pp=258\u2013259}} The British commanders disapproved of retaliations against civilians, and British troops carried out few reprisals.{{sfn|Briddiscombe|1998|p=257}}\n\nThe [[First Canadian Army]] served in the predominately British [[21st Army Group]], and more frequently retaliated against German civilians than the British.{{sfn|Briddiscombe|1998|p=257}} The commander of [[4th Canadian Division|4th&nbsp;Canadian (Armoured) Division]], Major-General [[Christopher Vokes]], believed that destroying property was the most appropriate way of responding to resistance by German civilians. The division carried out actions against German property more often than any other Canadian formation.{{sfn|Briddiscombe|1998|pp=258\u2013259}}\n\n[[Red Army|Soviet forces]] conducted retaliatory actions than more frequently than their Western Allies. The [[Soviet Union]]'s leadership was concerned about the threat of a [[Werwolf|German resistance movement]], and Soviet forces killed, raped and imprisoned large numbers of local civilians and destroyed property following guerrilla attacks.{{sfn|Briddiscombe|1998|pp=268\u2013270}}\n\n===Allied attitudes===\n\nThe attitude towards the Germans throughout the Allied ranks was harsh. There was frustration at their continued resistance in a clearly hopeless cause, anger at the casualties they inflicted when the war was widely, and correctly, perceived to be almost over, and a general feeling that severe, even ruthless, treatment of German soldiers and civilians was justified.{{sfn|Atkinson|2015|p=597}} On 15&nbsp;April the British reached [[Bergen-Belsen concentration camp]], where the inmates had been reduced to cannibalism.{{sfn|Atkinson|2015|p=599}} The historian [[Rick Atkinson]] wrote that \"the revelations of April&nbsp;... sparked enduring outrage\".{{sfn|Atkinson|2015|p=604}}\n\nThis was the case at all levels. An American officer wrote \"The attitude of higher command seemed to be that these people&nbsp;... should be made to feel the full significance of war and what their troops had done to other people.\"{{sfn|Hastings|2004|pp=493\u2013494}} The US general [[George Patton]] wrote in his diary \"In hundreds of villages&nbsp;... most of the houses are heaps of stone&nbsp;... I did most of it.\" When a [[sniper]] fired at one of his officers, he ordered several German houses to be burnt.{{sfn|Atkinson|2015|p=568}} When the commander of US [[3rd Armored Division (United States)|3rd Armored Division]] was killed in action {{convert|150|mi|km|disp=flip}} inside Germany on 30&nbsp;March, several villages were razed by his irate troops, captured wounded Germans were shot on the spot and at least 45&nbsp;Germans were executed after surrendering.{{sfn|Atkinson|2015|pp=581\u2013582}} An artillery officer wrote home in April \"we should fire about a thousand rounds into every [German] town. Do them good\".{{sfn|Atkinson|2015|p=598}} At least one British battalion refused to take [[Waffen-SS]] prisoners, shooting those who surrendered; an officer of the battalion blamed this on SS \"truculence\".{{sfn|Hastings|2004|p=499}} A British battalion commander summed up the risk-averse attitude within his unit: \"At this stage of the war, no one was very keen to earn medals.\"{{sfn|Hastings|2004|p=492}} A British pilot wrote: \"It seemed a stupid time to die.\"{{sfn|Hastings|2004|p=492}} A British [[corporal]] spoke for many when he wrote \"Why don't the silly bastards give up?\"{{sfn|Atkinson|2015|p=597}} Some divisions had suffered their last fatality by mid-April.{{sfn|Hastings|2004|p=500}} The historian [[Max Hastings]] wrote \"The final Anglo-American drive across Germany offered ... many foolish little battles which wasted men's lives\".{{sfn|Hastings|2004|p=491}}\n\n===Battle for S\u00f6gel===\n[[File:Moncel and Vokes.jpg|thumb|upright=1.15|right|alt=Major-General Christopher Vokes in discussion with Brigadier Robert Moncel standing in a street in S\u00f6gel on 10&nbsp;April 1945|{{center|Major-General [[Christopher Vokes]] (right) with Brigadier [[Robert Moncel]] at S\u00f6gel on 10 April 1945.}}]]\nIn early April 1945 the 4th&nbsp;Canadian (Armoured) Division, as part of [[II&nbsp;Canadian Corps]], moved out of the eastern Netherlands in the wake of the Allied crossing of the [[Rhine]] in [[Operation Plunder]]. The Canadian official history describes the circumstances as buoyant as it was recognized that the end of World War II in Europe was close.{{sfn|Stacey|1960|p=527}} On 4&nbsp;April, [[Argyll and Sutherland Highlanders of Canada (Princess Louise's)|The Argyll and Sutherland Highlanders of Canada]], part of the [[10th&nbsp;Canadian Infantry Brigade]], one of two [[brigades]] in the division,{{#tag:ref|The other battalions in the brigade were: [[The Lincoln and Welland Regiment]]; and [[The Algonquin Regiment]].{{sfn|Canadian Soldier|2019}}|group=Note}} made an assault crossing of the [[Ems (river)|Ems]] river and captured the town of [[Meppen]], suffering only one casualty. German prisoners included several 17-year-old youths with less than eight weeks of military experience.{{sfn|Stacey|1960|p=557}}\n\nThe division advanced a further {{convert|25|km}} to S\u00f6gel, which the 1st&nbsp;Battalion of [[Lake Superior Regiment|The Lake Superior Regiment (Motor)]]{{#tag:ref|The Lake Superior Regiment (Motor) was part of [[4th Canadian Armoured Brigade]] which also included: 21st Armoured Regiment ([[The Governor General's Foot Guards]]); 22nd&nbsp;Armoured Regiment ([[The Canadian Grenadier Guards]]); and 28th&nbsp;Armoured Regiment ([[The British Columbia Regiment]]).{{sfn|Canadian Soldier|2019}}|group=Note}} captured on 9&nbsp;April. The following day it repulsed several German counter-attacks before the town was declared cleared.{{sfn|Williams|1988|p=276}}{{sfn|Stacey|1960|p=558}} Some German civilians joined the fighting and were believed to have killed several Canadian soldiers. Vokes, believing the civilians needed to be taught a lesson, ordered the destruction of the centre of the town.{{sfn|Morton|2016|}} This was accomplished with several truckloads of dynamite. Vokes was aware that these actions violated the Hague Conventions and took care not to issue written instructions.{{sfn|Briddiscombe|1998|pp=258\u2013259}} Soldiers of the division started referring to Vokes as \"The Sod of S\u00f6gel\".{{sfn|Foster|2000|page=437}} The Canadian Army official history states: {{quote|Investigation established that German civilians had taken part in this fighting and had been responsible for the loss of Canadian lives. Accordingly, as a [[reprisal]] and a warning, several houses in the centre of S\u00f6gel were ordered destroyed by the engineers to provide rubble.{{sfn|Stacey|1960|p=558}}}}\n\n==Battle for Friesoythe==\n\nThe Canadian advance continued across the [[Westphalian Lowland]], reaching the outskirts of Friesoythe, a strategic crossroads, on 13&nbsp;April. As it was early spring, the ground was sodden and heavy vehicles could not operate off the main roads.{{sfn|Stacey|1960|p=558}} This made Friesoythe, {{convert|20|mi|km|disp=flip}} west of [[Oldenburg]], on the River [[Soeste]], a potential bottleneck. If the Germans were to hold it, the bulk of the Canadians would be unable to continue their advance.{{sfn|Zuehlke|2010|page=305}} Most of the population of 4,000 had evacuated to the countryside on 11\u201312 April.{{#tag:ref|The Friesoythe Amtsgericht, or District Court, was closed on 11&nbsp; April. If the District Court ceased to function on 11&nbsp;April 1945, the evacuation of the bulk of the civilian population probably took place between 11&nbsp;and 12&nbsp;April. This was clearly a German initiative.{{sfn|Cloppenburg|2003|pp=165, 189}}{{sfn|Brockhaus|1996|p=730}}|group=Note}} Several hundred paratroopers from Battalion Raabe of the German [[7th Parachute Division (Germany)|7th&nbsp;Parachute Division]] and anti-tank guns defended the town.{{sfn|Zuehlke|2010|page=305}}{{sfn|Sirluck|1945|}} The paratroopers repelled an attack by the Lake Superior Regiment, which suffered several killed and wounded; German casualties are unknown.{{sfn|Marsh|2015|}}\n\nVokes ordered the resumption of the attack by the 1st&nbsp;Battalion, The Argyll and Sutherland Highlanders (Princess Louise's), commanded by [[Lieutenant-colonel (Canada)|Lieutenant-Colonel]] Frederick Wigle. The Argylls conducted a flanking night march and launched a dawn assault on 14&nbsp;April. The attack met only scattered resistance from a disorganized garrison, and the Argylls secured the town by 10:30. During the confused fighting, approximately 50&nbsp;German soldiers{{sfn|Briddiscombe|1998|p=257}} caught Wigle's tactical headquarters by surprise at around 08:30. A firefight broke out, resulting in the death of Wigle and several other soldiers.

He wrote in his autobiography that \"a first-rate officer of mine, for whom I had a special regard and affection, and in whom I had a particular professional interest because of his talent for command, was killed. Not merely killed, it was reported to me, but sniped in the back\". Vokes wrote, \"I summoned my {{Abbr|GSO1|general staff officer}}... 'Mac,' I roared at him, 'I'm going to raze that goddam town.

In the side streets, soldiers threw petrol containers into buildings and ignited them with [[White phosphorus munitions|phosphorus grenades]]. The attack continued for over eight hours and Friesoythe was almost totally destroyed.{{sfn|Zuehlke|2010|page=308}} As the commanding officer of the 1st&nbsp;Battalion, [[The Algonquin Regiment]] later wrote, \"the raging Highlanders cleared the remainder of that town as no town has been cleared for centuries, we venture to say\".{{sfn|Cassidy|1948|p=307}} The war diary of the 4th&nbsp;Canadian Armoured Brigade records, \"when darkness fell Friesoythe was a reasonable facsimile of Dante's Inferno\".{{sfn|Zuehlke|2010|page=309}}\n\nThe Canadian official history states that Friesoythe \"was set on fire in a mistaken reprisal\".{{sfn|Stacey|1960|p=722}} The rubble was used to reinforce the local roads for the division's tanks and heavy transport, which had been unable to move up due to the main roads near the town being badly cratered, and the smaller roads being inadequate to stand their weight.{{sfn|Rogers|1989|p=259}}{{sfn|Granatstein|2010|p=16}}\n\n===Civilian casualties and damage===\nDuring the fighting around Friesoythe and its aftermath, ten civilians from the town and another ten from the surrounding villages were killed.{{sfn|Stadt Friesoythe|2018}} There were reports of civilians lying dead in the streets.{{sfn|Zuehlke|2010|page=308}} According to one German assessment, 85\u201390 per cent of the town was destroyed during the reprisal.{{sfn|Cloppenburg|2003|p=189}} The {{Lang|de|Brockhaus Enzyklopaedie}} estimates the destruction to have been as high as 90 per cent.

The [[4th Canadian (Armoured) Division]] attacked the German-held town of [[Friesoythe]] and one of its [[battalion]]s, [[Argyll and Sutherland Highlanders of Canada (Princess Louise's)|The Argyll and Sutherland Highlanders of Canada]], captured it.\n\nDuring the fighting the battalion's commander was killed by a German soldier, but it was incorrectly rumoured that he had been killed by a civilian. Under this mistaken belief, the division's commander, [[Major General|Major-General]] [[Christopher Vokes]], ordered that the town be razed in [[Reprisal|retaliation]] and it was substantially destroyed. Twenty German civilians died in Friesoythe and the surrounding area during the two days of fighting and its aftermath. Similar, if usually less extreme, events occurred elsewhere in Germany as the Allies advanced in the closing weeks of the war.\n\nThe rubble of the town was used to fill craters in local roads to make them passable for the division's tanks and heavy vehicles. A few days earlier, the division had destroyed the centre of [[S\u00f6gel]] in another reprisal and also used the rubble to make the roads passable. Little official notice was taken of the incident and the [[Official History of the Canadian Army in the Second World War|Canadian Army official history]] glosses over it. It is covered in the regimental histories of the units involved and several accounts of the campaign. Forty years later, Vokes wrote in his autobiography that he had \"no great remorse over the elimination of Friesoythe\".\n\n==Context==\n===Allied tactics===\nBy September 1944, the [[Allies of World War II|Western Allies]] had reached [[Nazi Germany|Germany's]] western border,{{sfn|Ambrose|1997|p=117}} and by the end of October had [[Battle of Aachen|captured Aachen]], the first major German city to fall to them.{{sfn|Hastings|2004|pp=106\u2013107}} Over the following six months they overran much of western Germany. In November the [[Supreme Headquarters Allied Expeditionary Force]] (SHAEF) publicly stated that the forces of the Western Allies would strictly adhere to international law in respect of their treatment of civilians.{{sfn|Briddiscombe|1998|p=256}} However, SHAEF's manual ''Combating the Guerrilla'' stated that there were circumstances where commanders could take \"stern measures\" against civilians as a [[reprisal|rapid response]] to guerrilla attacks, although this was in breach of the [[Hague Conventions of 1899 and 1907|Hague Conventions]].{{sfn|Briddiscombe|1998|p=256}}\n\nThe frequency and nature of retaliatory actions differed between national contingents within the Western Allied forces.{{sfn|Briddiscombe|1998|p=257}} Following SHAEF's policy, [[United States Army]] forces destroyed German buildings on several occasions, sometimes entire villages, and took other measures against German civilians. French troops took a similar, if more rigorous, approach to that of the Americans.{{sfn|Briddiscombe|1998|pp=258\u2013259}} The British commanders disapproved of retaliations against civilians, and British troops carried out few reprisals.{{sfn|Briddiscombe|1998|p=257}}\n\nThe [[First Canadian Army]] served in the predominately British [[21st Army Group]], and more frequently retaliated against German civilians than the British.{{sfn|Briddiscombe|1998|p=257}} The commander of [[4th Canadian Division|4th&nbsp;Canadian (Armoured) Division]], Major-General [[Christopher Vokes]], believed that destroying property was the most appropriate way of responding to resistance by German civilians. The division carried out actions against German property more often than any other Canadian formation.{{sfn|Briddiscombe|1998|pp=258\u2013259}}\n\n[[Red Army|Soviet forces]] conducted retaliatory actions than more frequently than their Western Allies. The [[Soviet Union]]'s leadership was concerned about the threat of a [[Werwolf|German resistance movement]], and Soviet forces killed, raped and imprisoned large numbers of local civilians and destroyed property following guerrilla attacks.{{sfn|Briddiscombe|1998|pp=268\u2013270}}\n\n===Allied attitudes===\n\nThe attitude towards the Germans throughout the Allied ranks was harsh. There was frustration at their continued resistance in a clearly hopeless cause, anger at the casualties they inflicted when the war was widely, and correctly, perceived to be almost over, and a general feeling that severe, even ruthless, treatment of German soldiers and civilians was justified.{{sfn|Atkinson|2015|p=597}} On 15&nbsp;April the British reached [[Bergen-Belsen concentration camp]], where the inmates had been reduced to cannibalism.{{sfn|Atkinson|2015|p=599}} The historian [[Rick Atkinson]] wrote that \"the revelations of April&nbsp;... sparked enduring outrage\".{{sfn|Atkinson|2015|p=604}}\n\nThis was the case at all levels. An American officer wrote \"The attitude of higher command seemed to be that these people&nbsp;... should be made to feel the full significance of war and what their troops had done to other people.\"{{sfn|Hastings|2004|pp=493\u2013494}} The US general [[George Patton]] wrote in his diary \"In hundreds of villages&nbsp;... most of the houses are heaps of stone&nbsp;... I did most of it.\" When a [[sniper]] fired at one of his officers, he ordered several German houses to be burnt.{{sfn|Atkinson|2015|p=568}} When the commander of US [[3rd Armored Division (United States)|3rd Armored Division]] was killed in action {{convert|150|mi|km|disp=flip}} inside Germany on 30&nbsp;March, several villages were razed by his irate troops, captured wounded Germans were shot on the spot and at least 45&nbsp;Germans were executed after surrendering.{{sfn|Atkinson|2015|pp=581\u2013582}} An artillery officer wrote home in April \"we should fire about a thousand rounds into every [German] town. Do them good\".{{sfn|Atkinson|2015|p=598}} At least one British battalion refused to take [[Waffen-SS]] prisoners, shooting those who surrendered; an officer of the battalion blamed this on SS \"truculence\".{{sfn|Hastings|2004|p=499}} A British battalion commander summed up the risk-averse attitude within his unit: \"At this stage of the war, no one was very keen to earn medals.\"{{sfn|Hastings|2004|p=492}} A British pilot wrote: \"It seemed a stupid time to die.\"{{sfn|Hastings|2004|p=492}} A British [[corporal]] spoke for many when he wrote \"Why don't the silly bastards give up?\"{{sfn|Atkinson|2015|p=597}} Some divisions had suffered their last fatality by mid-April.{{sfn|Hastings|2004|p=500}} The historian [[Max Hastings]] wrote \"The final Anglo-American drive across Germany offered ... many foolish little battles which wasted men's lives\".{{sfn|Hastings|2004|p=491}}\n\n===Battle for S\u00f6gel===\n[[File:Moncel and Vokes.jpg|thumb|upright=1.15|right|alt=Major-General Christopher Vokes in discussion with Brigadier Robert Moncel standing in a street in S\u00f6gel on 10&nbsp;April 1945|{{center|Major-General [[Christopher Vokes]] (right) with Brigadier [[Robert Moncel]] at S\u00f6gel on 10 April 1945.}}]]\nIn early April 1945 the 4th&nbsp;Canadian (Armoured) Division, as part of [[II&nbsp;Canadian Corps]], moved out of the eastern Netherlands in the wake of the Allied crossing of the [[Rhine]] in [[Operation Plunder]]. The Canadian official history describes the circumstances as buoyant as it was recognized that the end of World War II in Europe was close.{{sfn|Stacey|1960|p=527}} On 4&nbsp;April, [[Argyll and Sutherland Highlanders of Canada (Princess Louise's)|The Argyll and Sutherland Highlanders of Canada]], part of the [[10th&nbsp;Canadian Infantry Brigade]], one of two [[brigades]] in the division,{{#tag:ref|The other battalions in the brigade were: [[The Lincoln and Welland Regiment]]; and [[The Algonquin Regiment]].{{sfn|Canadian Soldier|2019}}|group=Note}} made an assault crossing of the [[Ems (river)|Ems]] river and captured the town of [[Meppen]], suffering only one casualty. German prisoners included several 17-year-old youths with less than eight weeks of military experience.{{sfn|Stacey|1960|p=557}}\n\nThe division advanced a further {{convert|25|km}} to S\u00f6gel, which the 1st&nbsp;Battalion of [[Lake Superior Regiment|The Lake Superior Regiment (Motor)]]{{#tag:ref|The Lake Superior Regiment (Motor) was part of [[4th Canadian Armoured Brigade]] which also included: 21st Armoured Regiment ([[The Governor General's Foot Guards]]); 22nd&nbsp;Armoured Regiment ([[The Canadian Grenadier Guards]]); and 28th&nbsp;Armoured Regiment ([[The British Columbia Regiment]]).{{sfn|Canadian Soldier|2019}}|group=Note}} captured on 9&nbsp;April. The following day it repulsed several German counter-attacks before the town was declared cleared.{{sfn|Williams|1988|p=276}}{{sfn|Stacey|1960|p=558}} Some German civilians joined the fighting and were believed to have killed several Canadian soldiers. Vokes, believing the civilians needed to be taught a lesson, ordered the destruction of the centre of the town.{{sfn|Morton|2016|}} This was accomplished with several truckloads of dynamite. Vokes was aware that these actions violated the Hague Conventions and took care not to issue written instructions.{{sfn|Briddiscombe|1998|pp=258\u2013259}} Soldiers of the division started referring to Vokes as \"The Sod of S\u00f6gel\".{{sfn|Foster|2000|page=437}} The Canadian Army official history states: {{quote|Investigation established that German civilians had taken part in this fighting and had been responsible for the loss of Canadian lives. Accordingly, as a [[reprisal]] and a warning, several houses in the centre of S\u00f6gel were ordered destroyed by the engineers to provide rubble.{{sfn|Stacey|1960|p=558}}}}\n\n==Battle for Friesoythe==\n\nThe Canadian advance continued across the [[Westphalian Lowland]], reaching the outskirts of Friesoythe, a strategic crossroads, on 13&nbsp;April. As it was early spring, the ground was sodden and heavy vehicles could not operate off the main roads.{{sfn|Stacey|1960|p=558}} This made Friesoythe, {{convert|20|mi|km|disp=flip}} west of [[Oldenburg]], on the River [[Soeste]], a potential bottleneck. If the Germans were to hold it, the bulk of the Canadians would be unable to continue their advance.{{sfn|Zuehlke|2010|page=305}} Most of the population of 4,000 had evacuated to the countryside on 11\u201312 April.{{#tag:ref|The Friesoythe Amtsgericht, or District Court, was closed on 11&nbsp; April. If the District Court ceased to function on 11&nbsp;April 1945, the evacuation of the bulk of the civilian population probably took place between 11&nbsp;and 12&nbsp;April. This was clearly a German initiative.{{sfn|Cloppenburg|2003|pp=165, 189}}{{sfn|Brockhaus|1996|p=730}}|group=Note}} Several hundred paratroopers from Battalion Raabe of the German [[7th Parachute Division (Germany)|7th&nbsp;Parachute Division]] and anti-tank guns defended the town.{{sfn|Zuehlke|2010|page=305}}{{sfn|Sirluck|1945|}} The paratroopers repelled an attack by the Lake Superior Regiment, which suffered several killed and wounded; German casualties are unknown.{{sfn|Marsh|2015|}}\n\nVokes ordered the resumption of the attack by the 1st&nbsp;Battalion, The Argyll and Sutherland Highlanders (Princess Louise's), commanded by [[Lieutenant-colonel (Canada)|Lieutenant-Colonel]] Frederick Wigle. The Argylls conducted a flanking night march and launched a dawn assault on 14&nbsp;April. The attack met only scattered resistance from a disorganized garrison, and the Argylls secured the town by 10:30. During the confused fighting, approximately 50&nbsp;German soldiers{{sfn|Briddiscombe|1998|p=257}} caught Wigle's tactical headquarters by surprise at around 08:30. A firefight broke out, resulting in the death of Wigle and several other soldiers. A rumour circulated that a local civilian had shot Wigle.{{sfn|Zuehlke|2010|page=308}}{{sfn|A&SHC archive|1945}}{{sfn|Fraser|1996|p=431}}\n\n===Destruction of Friesoythe===\nVokes was furious when he heard of Wigle's death. He wrote in his autobiography that \"a first-rate officer of mine, for whom I had a special regard and affection, and in whom I had a particular professional interest because of his talent for command, was killed. Not merely killed, it was reported to me, but sniped in the back\". Vokes wrote, \"I summoned my {{Abbr|GSO1|general staff officer}}... 'Mac,' I roared at him, 'I'm going to raze that goddam town. Tell 'em we're going to level the fucking place. Get the people the hell out of their houses first.{{'\"}}{{sfn|Foster|2000|page=437}}{{sfn|Vokes|1985|pages=194\u2013195}} Vokes's GSO1 (head of the operations staff), Lieutenant-Colonel Mackenzie Robinson, obeyed but convinced him to not put this order in writing or issue a proclamation to the local civilians.{{sfn|Foster|2000|page=437}}{{sfn|Briddiscombe|1998|pp=259, 295}} Hastings writes that the earlier incident at S\u00f6gel contributed to Vokes's fury.{{sfn|Hastings|2004|p=500}}\n\nThe Argylls had spontaneously begun to burn Friesoythe in reprisal for the death of their commander.{{sfn|Fraser|1996|pp=435\u2013437}} After Vokes had issued his order, the town was systematically set on fire with [[flamethrowers]] mounted on [[Universal Carrier|Wasp Carriers]]. In the side streets, soldiers threw petrol containers into buildings and ignited them with [[White phosphorus munitions|phosphorus grenades]]. The attack continued for over eight hours and Friesoythe was almost totally destroyed.{{sfn|Zuehlke|2010|page=308}} As the commanding officer of the 1st&nbsp;Battalion, [[The Algonquin Regiment]] later wrote, \"the raging Highlanders cleared the remainder of that town as no town has been cleared for centuries, we venture to say\".{{sfn|Cassidy|1948|p=307}} The war diary of the 4th&nbsp;Canadian Armoured Brigade records, \"when darkness fell Friesoythe was a reasonable facsimile of Dante's Inferno\".{{sfn|Zuehlke|2010|page=309}}\n\nThe Canadian official history states that Friesoythe \"was set on fire in a mistaken reprisal\".{{sfn|Stacey|1960|p=722}} The rubble was used to reinforce the local roads for the division's tanks and heavy transport, which had been unable to move up due to the main roads near the town being badly cratered, and the smaller roads being inadequate to stand their weight.{{sfn|Rogers|1989|p=259}}{{sfn|Granatstein|2010|p=16}}\n\n===Civilian casualties and damage===\nDuring the fighting around Friesoythe and its aftermath, ten civilians from the town and another ten from the surrounding villages were killed.{{sfn|Stadt Friesoythe|2018}} There were reports of civilians lying dead in the streets.{{sfn|Zuehlke|2010|page=308}} According to one German assessment, 85\u201390 per cent of the town was destroyed during the reprisal.{{sfn|Cloppenburg|2003|p=189}} The {{Lang|de|Brockhaus Enzyklopaedie}} estimates the destruction to have been as high as 90 per cent. The town's website records that of 381{{nbsp}}houses in the town proper, 231{{nbsp}}were destroyed and another 30&nbsp; badly damaged.{{sfn|Stadt Friesoythe|2018}} A few days later, a Canadian nurse wrote home that the [[convent]] on the edge of town was the only building left standing.{{sfn|Hibbert|1985|p=84}} In the suburb of Altenoythe, 120{{nbsp}}houses and 110{{nbsp}}other buildings were destroyed.{{sfn|Stadt Friesoythe|2018}} In 2010, the author Mark Zuehlk suggested that, \"Not all of Friesoythe was burnt, but its centre was destroyed\".{{sfn|Zuehlke|2010|page=309}}\n\n==Aftermath==\n\n{{Quote box|width=20em|align=left|quote=You should know our soldiers were kind to the children of our enemies, and kind to those in adversity.

It is analogous to the German ''Wissenschaftslehre'' (literally, theory of science) which was introduced by philosophers [[Johann Fichte]] and [[Bernard Bolzano]] in the late 18th century. The word first appeared in English in 1847 as a translation of the German in New York's ''Eclectic Magazine'' review of a philosophical novel by German author [[Jean Paul]]:<ref>{{cite book |title=Oxford English Dictionary |date=2014 |publisher=Oxford University Press |edition=3rd |chapter=Epistemology}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |last1 = anonymous| title=Jean-Paul Frederich Richter |journal=The Eclectic Magazine of Foreign Literature, Science and Art |date=Nov 1847 |volume=12 |page=317 | hdl=2027/iau.31858055206621 }}.</ref>\n\n{{Quote|text=The title of one of the principal works of Fichte is \u2032Wissenschaftslehre,\u2032 which, after the analogy of ''technology'' ... we render ''epistemology''.}}\n\nIt was properly introduced in the philosophical literature by Scottish philosopher [[James Frederick Ferrier]] in his ''Institutes of Metaphysics'' (1854):<ref>{{cite book |last1=Ferrier |first1=James Frederick |title=Institutes of metaphysic : the theory of knowing and being |date=1854 |publisher=W.

E.g., [[\u00c9mile Meyerson]] opened his ''Identity and Reality'', written in 1908, with the remark that the word 'is becoming current' as equivalent to 'the philosophy of the sciences.'<ref>{{cite book |last1=Meyerson |first1=\u00c9mile |title=Identit\u00e9 et r\u00e9alit\u00e9 |date=1908 |publisher=F.

[[John Locke]] describes his ''[[An Essay Concerning Human Understanding|Essay Concerning Human Understanding]]'' (1689) as an inquiry \"into the original, certainty, and extent of human knowledge, together with the grounds and degrees of belief, opinion, and assent\".<ref>{{cite book |last1=Locke |first1=John |title=An Essay Concerning Human Understanding |chapter-url=https://archive.org/details/in.ernet.dli.2015.223061 |date=1689 |chapter=Introduction}}</ref> According to Brett Warren, the character ''Epistemon'' in [[James VI and I|King James VI of Scotland]]'s ''[[Daemonologie]]'' (1591) \"was meant to be a personification of a philosophical concept currently known as 'epistemology': the investigation into the differences of a justified belief versus its opinion.\"<ref name=\"auto\">{{cite book|last1=King James|first2=Brett|last2=Warren|title=The Annotated Daemonologie.

Some philosophers think there is an important distinction between [[Propositional knowledge|\"knowing that\"]] (know a concept), [[Know-how|\"knowing how\"]] (understand an operation), and [[Knowledge by acquaintance|\"acquaintance-knowledge\"]] (know by relation), with epistemology being primarily concerned with the first of these.<ref>John Bengson (Editor), Marc A. Moffett (Editor): Essays on Knowledge, Mind, and Action. New York: Oxford University Press. 2011</ref>\n\nWhile these distinctions are not explicit in English, they are defined explicitly in other languages (N.B. some languages related to English have been said to retain these verbs, e.g. [[Scots language|Scots]]: {{lang|sco|wit}} and {{lang|sco|[[wikt:ken#Scots|ken]]}}). In French, Portuguese, Spanish, German and Dutch 'to know (a person)' is translated using {{lang|fr|conna\u00eetre}}, {{lang|pt|conhecer}}, {{lang|es|conocer}} and {{lang|de|kennen}} (both German and Dutch) respectively, whereas 'to know (how to do something)' is translated using {{lang|fr|savoir}}, {{lang|es|saber}} (both Portuguese and Spanish), {{lang|de|wissen}}, and {{lang|nl|weten}}. Modern Greek has the verbs {{lang|el|\u03b3\u03bd\u03c9\u03c1\u03af\u03b6\u03c9}} ({{lang|el-Latn|gnor\u00edzo}}) and {{lang|el|\u03be\u03ad\u03c1\u03c9}} ({{lang|el-Latn|ks\u00e9ro}}). Italian has the verbs {{lang|it|conoscere}} and {{lang|it|sapere}} and the nouns for 'knowledge' are {{lang|it|conoscenza}} and {{lang|it|sapienza}}. German has the verbs {{lang|de|wissen}} and {{lang|de|kennen}}; the former implies knowing a fact, the latter knowing in the sense of being acquainted with and having a working knowledge of; there is also a noun derived from {{lang|de|kennen}}, namely {{lang|de|Erkennen}}, which has been said to imply knowledge in the form of recognition or acknowledgment.<ref>For related linguistic data, see {{cite journal |last1=Benton |first1=Matthew |title=Epistemology Personalized |journal=The Philosophical Quarterly |date=2017 |volume=67 |issue=269 |pages=813\u2013834 |doi=10.1093/pq/pqx020 |url=https://philpapers.org/rec/BENEP-3 }}, esp. Section 1.</ref> The verb itself implies a process: you have to go from one state to another, from a state of \"not-{{lang|de|erkennen}}\" to a state of true {{lang|de|erkennen}}. This verb seems the most appropriate in terms of describing the \"episteme\" in one of the modern European languages, hence the German name \"{{lang|de|[[:de:Erkenntnistheorie|Erkenntnistheorie]]}}\". The theoretical interpretation and significance of these linguistic issues remains controversial.\n\nIn his paper ''On Denoting'' and his later book ''Problems of Philosophy'' [[Bertrand Russell]] stressed the distinction between \"[[knowledge by description]]\" and \"[[knowledge by acquaintance]].\" [[Gilbert Ryle]] is also credited with stressing the distinction between knowing how and knowing that in ''[[The Concept of Mind]].'' In ''Personal Knowledge,'' [[Michael Polanyi]] argues for the epistemological relevance of knowledge how and knowledge that; using the example of the act of balance involved in riding a [[bicycle]], he suggests that the theoretical knowledge of the [[physics]] involved in maintaining a state of [[bicycle and motorcycle dynamics#Balance|balance]] cannot substitute for the practical knowledge of how to ride, and that it is important to understand how both are established and grounded. This position is essentially Ryle's, who argued that a failure to acknowledge the distinction between knowledge that and knowledge how leads to [[infinite regress]].\n\nIn recent times, epistemologists including [[Ernest Sosa|Sosa]], [[John Greco (philosopher)|Greco]], [[Jonathan Kvanvig|Kvanvig]],<ref>{{cite book |last1=Kvanvig |first1=Jonathan L. |title=The Value of Knowledge and the Pursuit of Understanding |date=2003 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |isbn=9781139442282 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ILTIEjvbeLoC |language=en}}{{page needed|date=March 2019}}</ref> [[Linda Trinkaus Zagzebski|Zagzebski]] and Duncan Pritchard have argued that epistemology should evaluate people's \"properties\" (i.e., intellectual virtues) and not just the properties of propositions or of propositional mental attitudes.{{Citation needed|date=May 2012}}\n\n===Belief===\n{{Main|Belief}}\nIn common speech, a \"statement of belief\" is typically an expression of faith or trust in a person, power, or other entity. While it includes such traditional views, epistemology is also concerned with what we believe. This includes 'the truth' and everything else we accept as 'true' for ourselves from a cognitive point of view.{{cn|date=February 2020}}\n\n===Truth===\n{{Main|Truth}}\n{{See also|Criteria of truth}}\nWhether someone's belief is true is not a prerequisite for (its) belief.{{citation needed|date=August 2019}} On the other hand, if something is actually ''known'', then it categorically cannot be false.{{citation needed|date=August 2019}} For example, if a person believes that a bridge is safe enough to support her and attempts to cross it, but the bridge then collapses under her weight, it could be said that she ''believed'' that the bridge was safe but that her belief was mistaken. It would ''not'' be accurate to say that she ''knew'' that the bridge was safe, because it was not. By contrast, if the bridge supported her weight, then the person might say that she had believed the bridge was safe, whereas now, after proving it to herself (by crossing it), she ''knows'' it was safe.{{citation needed|date=August 2019}}{{Original research inline|date=August 2019}}\n\nEpistemologists argue over whether a belief is the proper [[truth-bearer]]. Some would rather describe knowledge as a system of justified true [[propositions]], and others as a system of justified true sentences. Plato, in his [[Gorgias_(dialogue)|Gorgias]], argues that belief is the most commonly invoked truth-bearer.<ref>{{Cite book |url=http://www.gutenberg.org/files/1672/1672-h/1672-h.htm |title=Gorgias |author=<!--Not stated--> |date=5 October 2008 |website=Project Gutenberg |publisher= |access-date=31 March 2017 |quote=}}</ref>\n\n===Justification===\nIn the ''[[Theaetetus (dialogue)|Theaetetus]]'', [[Socrates]] considers several theories as to what knowledge is, the last being that knowledge is true belief \"with an account\" (meaning explained or defined in some way). According to the theory that knowledge is justified true belief, to know that a given proposition is true, one must not only believe the relevant true proposition but also have a good reason for doing so.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Benardete |first1=Seth |title=The Being of the Beautiful |date=1984 |publisher=The University of Chicago Press |location=Chicago |isbn=978-0-226-67038-6 |page=I.169}}</ref> One implication of this would be that no one would gain knowledge just by believing something that happened to be true.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Benardete |first1=Seth |title=The Being of the Beautiful |date=1984 |publisher=The University of Chicago Press |location=Chicago |isbn=978-0-226-67038-6 |page=I.175}}</ref> For example, an ill person with no medical training, but with a generally optimistic attitude, might believe that he will recover from his illness quickly. Nevertheless, even if this belief turned out to be true, the patient would not have ''known'' that he would get well since his belief lacked justification.{{citation needed|date=August 2019}}{{Original research inline|date=August 2019}}\n\nThe definition of knowledge as the justified true belief was widely accepted until the 1960s.{{citation needed|date=August 2019}} At this time, a paper written by the American philosopher [[Edmund Gettier]] provoked significant widespread discussion. (See [[theory of justification|theories of justification]] for other views on the idea.)\n\n===Gettier problem===\n{{Main|Gettier problem}}\n[[File:Classical definition of Kno.svg|thumb|[[Euler diagram]] representing a definition of knowledge.{{citation needed|date=August 2019}}{{Original research inline|date=August 2019}}]]\n[[Edmund Gettier]] is best known for his 1963 paper entitled ''Is Justified True Belief Knowledge?'', which called into question the concept of knowledge as justified true belief.<ref name=gettier>\n{{cite journal\n|author=Gettier, Edmund\n|year= 1963\n|title=Is Justified True Belief Knowledge?\n|jstor=3326922\n|journal = Analysis\n|volume = 23\n|issue=6\n|pages=121\u2013123\n|doi = 10.2307/3326922\n|url= https://halshs.archives-ouvertes.fr/halshs-01439314/file/2013%20Gettier%20Conocimiento.pdf\n}}</ref> In a few pages, Gettier argued that there are situations in which one's belief may be justified and true, yet fail to count as knowledge. That is, Gettier contended that while justified belief in a true proposition is necessary for that proposition to be known, it is not sufficient. As in the diagram, a true proposition can be believed by an individual (purple region) but still not fall within the \"knowledge\" category (yellow region).\n\nAccording to Gettier, there are certain circumstances in which one does not have the knowledge, even when all of the above conditions are met. Gettier proposed two [[thought experiment]]s, which have become known as ''Gettier cases'', as [[counterexample]]s to the classical account of knowledge. One of the cases involves two men, Smith and Jones, who are awaiting the results of their applications for the same job. Each man has ten coins in his pocket. Smith has excellent reasons to believe that Jones will get the job and knows that Jones has ten coins in his pocket (he recently counted them). From this, Smith infers, \"The man who will get the job has ten coins in his pocket.\" However, Smith is unaware that he also has ten coins in his pocket. Furthermore, Smith, not Jones, is going to get the job. While Smith has strong evidence to believe that Jones will get the job, he is wrong. Smith has a justified true belief that the man who will get the job has ten coins in his pocket; however, according to Gettier, Smith does not ''know'' that the man who will get the job has ten coins in his pocket, because Smith's belief is \"...true by the number of coins in ''Jones's'' pocket, while Smith does not know how many coins are in Smith's pocket, and bases his belief...on a count of the coins in Jones's pocket, whom he falsely believes to be the man who will get the job.\" (see<ref name = gettier/> p.&nbsp;122.) These cases fail to be knowledge because the subject's belief is justified but only happens to be true by luck. In other words, he made the correct choice (believing that the man who will get the job has ten coins in his pocket) for the wrong reasons. This example is similar to those often given when discussing belief and truth\u2014wherein a person's belief of what will happen can coincidentally be correct without the actual knowledge to base it on.\n\n====Responses to Gettier====\n{{Unreferenced section|date=November 2015}}\nThe responses to Gettier have been varied. Usually, they have involved substantial attempts to define knowledge different from the classical one, either by recasting knowledge as justified true belief with some additional fourth condition or proposing a completely new set of conditions disregarding the classical ones entirely.\n\n=====Infallibilism, indefeasibility=====\nIn one response to Gettier, the American philosopher [[Richard Kirkham]] has argued that the only definition of knowledge that could ever be immune to all counterexamples is the [[infallibilism|infallibilist]] one.<ref>{{cite journal | url=http://www.centenary.edu/attachments/philosophy/aizawa/courses/epistemologyf2008/kirkham1984.pdf | title=Does the Gettier Problem Rest on a Mistake? | author=Richard L.

In other words, the justification for the belief must be infallible.\n\nYet another possible candidate for the fourth condition of knowledge is ''indefeasibility.'' [[Defeasibility]] theory maintains that there should be no overriding or defeating truths for the reasons that justify one's belief. For example, suppose that person ''S'' believes he saw Tom Grabit steal a book from the library and uses this to substantiate the claim that Tom Grabit took a book from the library. A possible defeater or overriding proposition for such a claim could be a true proposition like, \"Tom Grabit's identical twin Sam is currently in the same town as Tom.\" When no defeaters of one's justification exist, a subject would be epistemologically justified.\n\nThe Indian philosopher [[Bimal Krishna Matilal|B.K. Matilal]] has drawn on the [[Navya-Ny\u0101ya]] [[fallibilism]] tradition to respond to the Gettier problem. Nyaya theory distinguishes between ''know p,'' and ''know that one knows p''\u2014these are different events, with different causal conditions. The second level is a sort of implicit inference that usually follows immediately the episode of knowing p (knowledge ''simpliciter''). The Gettier case is examined by referring to a view of [[Gangesha Upadhyaya]] (late 12th century), who takes any true belief to be knowledge; thus, a true belief acquired through a wrong route may just be regarded as knowledge simpliciter on this view. The question of justification arises only at the second level when one considers the knowledge-hood of the acquired belief. Initially, there is a lack of uncertainty, so it becomes a true belief. But at the very next moment, when the hearer is about to embark upon the venture of ''knowing whether he knows p'', doubts may arise. \"If, in\nsome Gettier-like cases, I am wrong in my inference about the knowledge-hood of the given occurrent belief (for the evidence may be pseudo-evidence). I am mistaken about the truth of my belief\u2014and this is by Nyaya fallibilism: not all knowledge-claims can be sustained.\"<ref name=Matilal>\n{{cite book\n| author =      Bimal Krishna Matilal\n| title =       Perception: An Essay on Classical Indian Theories of Knowledge\n| publisher =   Oxford India 2002\n| year =        1986\n| ISBN =      978-0-19-824625-1\n| author-link = Bimal Krishna Matilal\n}} The Gettier problem is dealt with in Chapter 4, ''Knowledge as a mental episode''. The thread continues in the next chapter, ''Knowing that one knows''. It is also discussed in Matilal's ''Word and the World'' p. 71\u201372.</ref>\n\n=====Reliabilism=====\n{{Main|Reliabilism}}\nReliabilism has been a significant line of response to the Gettier problem among philosophers, originating with work by [[Alvin Goldman]] in the 1960s. According to reliabilism, a belief is justified (or otherwise supported in such a way as to count towards knowledge) only if it is produced by processes that typically yield a sufficiently high ratio of true to false beliefs. In other words, this theory states that a true belief counts as knowledge only if a reliable belief-forming process produces it. Examples of reliable processes include standard perceptual processes, remembering, good reasoning, and introspection.<ref>{{cite book | last1=Goldman | first1=Alvin I. | editor1-first=G.S.| editor1-last=Pappas |title=Justification and Knowledge | publisher=Reidel | location=Dordrecht, Holland | date=1979 | page=11 |chapter=Reliabilism: What Is Justified Belief? | isbn=978-90-277-1024-6}}</ref>\n\nGettier cases have challenged reliabilism. {{anchor|Henry and the barn fa\u00e7ades}}Another argument that challenges reliabilism, like the Gettier cases (although it was not presented in the same short article as the Gettier cases), is the case of Henry and the barn fa\u00e7ades. In the thought experiment, a man, Henry, is driving along and sees several buildings that resemble barns. Based on his perception of one of these, he concludes that he has just seen barns. While he has seen one, and the perception he based his belief that the one he saw was of a real barn, all the other [[barn]]-like buildings he saw were fa\u00e7ades. Theoretically, Henry does not know that he has seen a barn, despite both his belief that he has seen one being true and his belief being formed on the basis of a reliable process (i.e., his vision) since he only acquired his true belief by accident.<ref>{{cite journal |title=Appearing as Irreducible in Perception |first=Alan H. |last=Goldman |author-link= Alan H.

His belief via the method of the courtroom satisfies the four subjunctive conditions, but his faith-based belief does not. If his daughter were guilty, he would still believe her innocence, based on faith in his daughter; this would violate the third condition.\n\nThe British philosopher [[Simon Blackburn]] has criticized this formulation by suggesting that we do not want to accept as knowledge beliefs which, while they \"track the truth\" (as Nozick's account requires), are not held for appropriate reasons. He says that \"we do not want to award the title of knowing something to someone who is only meeting the conditions through a defect, flaw, or failure, compared with someone else who is not meeting the conditions.\"<ref name=\"Think: A compelling introduction to philosophy\">{{cite book |last=Blackburn|first=Simon|title=Think: A compelling introduction to philosophy|url=https://archive.org/details/thinkcompellingi00bla_kzi|url-access=registration|year=1999|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-976984-1}}</ref> In addition to this, externalist accounts of knowledge, such as Nozick's, are often forced to reject closure in cases where it is intuitively valid.\n\n[[Timothy Williamson]] has advanced a theory of knowledge according to which knowledge is not justified true belief plus some other condition(s), but primary. In his book ''[[Knowledge and its Limits]],'' Williamson argues that the concept of knowledge cannot be broken down into a set of other ideas through analysis. Instead, it is ''[[sui generis]].'' Thus, according to Williamson, justification, truth, and belief are [[Necessary and sufficient|necessary but not sufficient]] for knowledge.\n\n[[Alvin Goldman]] writes in his \"[[Causal Theory of Knowledge|Causal Theory of Knowing]]\" that knowledge requires a [[Causal chain|causal link]] between the truth of a proposition and the belief in that proposition.\n\n===Externalism and internalism===\n{{Main|Internalism, and externalism}}\nA central debate about the nature of justification is a debate between epistemological externalists on the one hand and epistemological internalists on the other.\n\nExternalists hold that factors deemed \"external,\" meaning outside of the psychological states of those who gain knowledge, can be conditions of justification. For example, an externalist response to the Gettier problem is to say that for a justified true belief to count as knowledge; there must be a link or dependency between the belief and the state of the external world. Usually, this is understood to be a causal link. Such causation, to the extent that it is \"outside\" the mind, would count as an external, knowledge-yielding condition. Internalists, on the other hand, assert that all knowledge-yielding conditions are within the psychological states of those who gain knowledge.\n\nThough unfamiliar with the internalist/externalist debate himself, many point to [[Ren\u00e9 Descartes]] as an early example of the internalist path to justification. He wrote that because the only method by which we perceive the external world is through our senses, and that, because the senses are not infallible, we should not consider our concept of knowledge infallible. The only way to find anything that could be described as \"indubitably true,\" he advocates, would be to see things \"clearly and distinctly.\" <ref name=Regulae>{{cite book |last=Descartes|first=Rene|title=The Philosophical Writings of Rene Descartes Vol. I|year=1985|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0-521-28807-1}}</ref> He argued that if there is an omnipotent, good being who made the world, then it's reasonable to believe that people are made with the ability to know. However, this does not mean that man's ability to know is perfect. God gave man the ability to know but not with omniscience. Descartes said that man must use his capacities for knowledge correctly and carefully through methodological doubt.<ref name=\"Meditations on First Philosophy\">{{cite book |last=Descartes|first=Rene|title=Philosophical Writings of Rene Descartes Vol. II|year=1985|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0-521-28808-8}}</ref>\n\nThe dictum \"Cogito ergo sum\" (I think; therefore I am) is also commonly associated with Descartes' theory. In his methodological doubt\u2014doubting everything he previously knew so he could start from a blank slate\u2014the first thing that he could not logically bring himself to doubt was his existence: \"I do not exist\" would be a contradiction in terms. The act of saying that one does not exist assumes that someone must be making the statement in the first place. Descartes could doubt his senses, his body, and the world around him\u2014but he could not deny his existence, because he was able to doubt and must exist to manifest that doubt. Even if some \"evil genius\" were deceiving him, he would have to exist to be deceived. This one sure point provided him with what he called his Archimedean point, to further develop his foundation for knowledge. Simply put, Descartes' epistemological justification depended on his indubitable belief in his own existence and his clear and distinct knowledge of God.<ref name=Refutations>{{cite book |last=Descartes|first=Rene|title=The Philosophical Writings of Rene Descartes|year=1985|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0-521-28808-8}}</ref>\n\n===Value problem===\nWe generally assume that knowledge is more valuable than mere true belief. If so, what is the explanation? A formulation of the value problem in epistemology first occurs in [[Plato]]'s Meno. Socrates points out to Meno that a man who knew the way to Larissa could lead others there correctly. But so, too, could a man who had true beliefs about how to get there, even if he had not gone there or had any knowledge of Larissa. Socrates says that it seems that both knowledge and true opinion can guide action. Meno then wonders why knowledge is valued more than true belief and why knowledge and true belief are different. Socrates responds that knowledge is more valuable than mere true belief because it is tethered or justified. Justification, or working out the reason for a true belief, locks down true belief.<ref>{{cite book | last1=Plato | title=Five Dialogues | date=2002 | publisher=Hackett Pub. Co. | location=Indianapolis, IN | pages=[https://archive.org/details/fivedialogueseut00plat/page/89 89\u201390; 97b\u201398a] | isbn=978-0-87220-633-5 | url=https://archive.org/details/fivedialogueseut00plat/page/89 }}</ref>\n\nThe problem is to identify what (if anything) makes knowledge more valuable than mere true belief, or that makes knowledge more valuable than mere minimal conjunction of its components, such as justification, safety, sensitivity, statistical likelihood, and anti-Gettier conditions, on a particular analysis of knowledge that conceives of knowledge as divided into components (to which knowledge-first epistemological theories, which posit knowledge as fundamental, are notable exceptions).<ref name=\"SEPValue\">{{cite web|url=http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/knowledge-value/|encyclopedia=Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy|title=The Value of Knowledge|first1=Duncan|last1=Pritchard|first2=John|last2=Turri|accessdate=2016-02-24}}</ref> The value problem reemerged in the philosophical literature on epistemology in the twenty-first century following the rise of [[virtue epistemology]] in the 1980s, partly because of the obvious link to the concept of value in ethics.<ref name=\"Pritchard-APQ\">{{Cite journal|title=Recent Work on Epistemic Value|first=Duncan|last=Pritchard|journal=American Philosophical Quarterly|date=April 2007|volume=44|number=2|pages=85\u2013110|jstor=20464361}}</ref>\n\nThe value problem has been presented as an argument against epistemic [[reliabilism]] by philosophers, including [[Linda Zagzebski]], [[Wayne Riggs]] and [[Richard Swinburne]]. Zagzebski analogizes the value of knowledge to the value of espresso produced by an espresso maker: \"The liquid in this cup is not improved by the fact that it comes from a reliable espresso maker. If the espresso tastes good, it makes no difference if it comes from an unreliable machine.\"<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Zagzebski|first1=Linda|title=The Search for the Source of Epistemic Good|journal=Metaphilosophy|volume=34|issue=1/2|page=13|url=https://philpapers.org/archive/ZAGTFE.pdf}}</ref> For Zagzebski, the value of knowledge deflates to the value of mere true belief. She assumes that reliability in itself has no value or disvalue, but Goldman and Olsson disagree. They point out that Zagzebski's conclusion rests on the assumption of veritism: all that matters is the acquisition of true belief.<ref>{{cite book | last1=Goldman | first1=Alvin I. | last2=Olsson| first2=E.J. | editor1-first=A. | editor1-last=Haddock | editor2-first=A. | editor2-last=Millar | editor3-first=D.| editor3-last=Pritchard |title=Epistemic Value | publisher=Oxford University Press | date=2009 | page=24 |chapter=Reliabilism and the Value of Knowledge |isbn=978-0-19-923118-8 | lastauthoramp=y}}</ref> To the contrary, they argue that a careful process for acquiring a true belief adds value to the mere true belief by making it more likely that future beliefs of a similar kind will be true. By analogy, having a reliable espresso maker that produced a good cup of espresso would be more valuable than having an unreliable one that luckily produced a good cup because the reliable one would more likely produce good future cups compared to the unreliable one.\n\nThe value problem is important for assessing the adequacy of theories of knowledge that conceive of knowledge as consisting of true belief and other components. According to [[Jonathan Kvanvig|Kvanvig]], an adequate account of knowledge should resist counterexamples and allow an explanation of the value of knowledge over mere true belief. Should a theory of knowledge fail to do so, it would prove inadequate.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Kvanvig|first1=Jonathan|title=The Value of Knowledge and the Pursuit of Understanding|date=2003|publisher=Cambridge University Press|location=Cambridge; New York | isbn=978-0-521-03786-0 | page=5}}</ref>\n\nOne of the more influential responses to the problem is that knowledge is not particularly valuable and is not what ought to be the main focus of epistemology. Instead, epistemologists ought to focus on other mental states, such as understanding.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Kvanvig|first1=Jonathan|title=The Value of Knowledge and the Pursuit of Understanding|date=2003|publisher=Cambridge University Press|location=Cambridge; New York| isbn=978-0-521-03786-0 }}</ref> Advocates of virtue epistemology have argued that the value of knowledge comes from an internal relationship between the knower and the mental state of believing.<ref name=\"SEPValue\" />\n\n==Acquiring knowledge==\n===''A priori'' and ''a posteriori'' knowledge===\n{{Main|A priori and a posteriori}}\nVarious philosophers have disputed the nature of this distinction; however, the terms may be roughly defined as follows:\n* ''[[A priori and a posteriori|A priori]]'' knowledge is the knowledge that is known independently of experience (that is, it is non-empirical, or arrived at beforehand, usually by reason). It will henceforth be acquired through anything independent from experience.\n* ''[[Empirical evidence|A posteriori]]'' knowledge is the knowledge that is known by experience (that is, it is empirical, or arrived at afterward).\nA priori knowledge is a way of gaining knowledge without the need for experience.  In Bruce Russell's article \"A Priori Justification and Knowledge\"<ref>Russell, Bruce, \"A Priori Justification and Knowledge,\" The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy (Summer 2014 Edition), Edward N. Zalta (ed.), URL = <http://plato.stanford.edu/archives/sum2014/entries/apriori/>.</ref> he says that it is \"knowledge based on a priori justification,\" (1) which relies on intuition and the nature of these intuitions.  A priori knowledge is often contrasted with posteriori knowledge, which is knowledge gained by experience.  A way to look at the difference between the two is through an example. Bruce Russell gives two propositions in which the reader decides which one he believes more.  Option A: All crows are birds.  Option B: All crows are black.  If you believe option A, then you are a priori justified in believing it because you don't have to see a crow to know it's a bird.  If you believe in option B, then you are posteriori justified to believe it because you have seen many crows, therefore, knowing they are black.  He goes on to say that it doesn't matter if the statement is true or not, only that if you believe in one or the other that matters.\n\nThe idea of a priori knowledge is that it is based on intuition or rational insights.  Laurence BonJour says in his article \"The Structure of Empirical Knowledge,\" <ref>BonJour, Laurence, 1985, The Structure of Empirical Knowledge, Cambridge, MA: Harvard University Press.</ref> that a \"rational insight is an immediate, non-inferential grasp, apprehension or 'seeing' that some proposition is necessarily true.\" (3) Going back to the crow example, by Laurence BonJour's definition, the reason you would believe in option A is that you have a direct knowledge that a crow is a bird, without ever experiencing one.\n\n[[Evolutionary psychology]] takes a novel approach to the problem. It says that there is an innate predisposition for certain types of learning. \"Only small parts of the brain resemble a [[tabula rasa]]; this is true even for human beings. The remainder is more like an exposed negative waiting to be dipped into a developer fluid\".<ref>Wilson, E.O., [[Sociobiology: The New Synthesis]]. Cambridge, Massachusetts: The Belknap Press of Harvard University Press. 1975</ref>\n\n===Analytic\u2013synthetic distinction===\n{{Main|Analytic\u2013synthetic distinction}}\n[[Immanuel Kant]], in his ''[[Critique of Pure Reason]]'', drew a distinction between \"analytic\" and \"synthetic\" propositions. He contended that some propositions are such that we can know they are true just by understanding their meaning. For example, consider, \"My father's brother is my uncle.\" We can know it is true solely by our understanding of what its terms mean. Philosophers call such propositions ''analytic\"''. Synthetic propositions, on the other hand, have distinct subjects and predicates. An example would be, \"My father's brother has black hair.\" Kant stated that all mathematical and scientific statements are analytic priori propositions because they are [[logical truth|necessarily true]] but our knowledge about the attributes of the mathematical or physical subjects we can only get by logical inference.\n\nThe American philosopher [[Willard Van Orman Quine]], in his ''[[Two Dogmas of Empiricism]]'', famously challenged the distinction, arguing that the two have a blurry boundary. Some contemporary philosophers have offered more sustainable accounts of the distinction.<ref>Russell, G.: Truth in Virtue of Meaning: A Defence of the Analytic/Synthetic Distinction. Oxford: Oxford University Press. 2008</ref>\n\n=== Science as knowledge acquisition ===\n{{Main|Philosophy of Science}}\n\nScience is viewed as a refined, formalized, systematic, or institutionalized form of the pursuit and acquisition of empirical knowledge. As such, the [[philosophy of science]] may be viewed variously as an application or foundation of the philosophy of knowledge acquisition.\n\n==Regress problem==\n{{Main|Regress argument}}\n\nThe regress problem is the problem of providing a complete logical foundation for human knowledge. The traditional way of supporting a rational argument is to appeal to other rational arguments, typically using chains of reason and rules of logic. A classic example that goes back to Aristotle is deducing that ''Socrates is mortal.'' We have a logical rule that says, ''All humans are mortal'' and an assertion that ''Socrates is human'' and we deduce that ''Socrates is mortal''. In this example, how do we know that Socrates is human? Presumably, we apply other rules such as:  ''All born from human females are human.'' Which then leaves open the question of how do we know that all born from humans are human? This is the regress problem: how can we eventually terminate a logical argument with some statement(s) that do not require further justification but can still be considered rational and justified? As John Pollock stated:\n\n<blockquote>... to justify a belief, one must appeal to a further justified belief. This means that one of two things can be the case. Either there are some beliefs that we can be justified for holding, without being able to justify them based on any other belief, or else for each justified belief, there is an infinite regress of (potential) justification [the nebula theory]. In this theory, there is no rock bottom of justification. Justification just meanders in and out through our network of beliefs, stopping nowhere.<ref name=Pollock>\n{{cite book\n| author =      John L.

It is also the impetus for Descartes' famous dictum: ''[[I think; therefore I am]]''. Descartes was looking for some logical statements that could be true without appeal to other explanations.\n\n===Response to the regress problem===\n\nMany epistemologists studying justification have attempted to argue for various types of chains of reasoning that can escape the regress problem.\n* Foundationalism\n[[Foundationalism|Foundationalists]] respond to the regress problem by asserting that certain \"foundations\" or \"basic beliefs\" support other beliefs but do not themselves require justification from different views. These beliefs might be justified because they are self-evident, infallible, or derive from reliable cognitive mechanisms. Perception, memory, and a priori intuition are often considered possible examples of fundamental beliefs.\n\nThe chief criticism of foundationalism is that if other beliefs do not support a belief, accepting it may be arbitrary or unjustified.<ref>{{cite SEP |url-id=justep-foundational |title=Foundational Theories of Epistemic Justification}}</ref>\n* Coherentism\nAnother response to the regress problem is [[coherentism]], which is the rejection of the assumption that the regress proceeds according to a pattern of linear justification. To avoid the charge of circularity, [[coherentism|coherentists]] hold that an individual belief is justified circularly by the way it fits together (coheres) with the rest of the belief system of which it is a part. This theory has the advantage of avoiding the infinite regress without claiming special, possibly arbitrary status for some particular class of beliefs. Yet, since a system can be coherent while also being wrong, coherentists face the difficulty of ensuring that the whole system [[correspondence theory of truth|corresponds]] to reality. Additionally, most logicians agree that any circular argument is, at best, only trivially valid. That is, to be illuminating, arguments must operate with information from multiple premises, not simply conclude by reiterating a premise.\n\nWarburton writes in ''Thinking from A to Z'', \"Circular arguments are not invalid; in other words, from a logical point of view, there is nothing intrinsically wrong with them. However, they are, when viciously circular, spectacularly uninformative.\" (Warburton 1996)\n* Foundherentism\nA position is known as ''[[foundherentism]]'', advanced by [[Susan Haack]], is meant to unify foundationalism and coherentism. One component of this theory is what is called the \"analogy of the crossword puzzle.\" Whereas, for example, infinitists regard the regress of reasons as \"shaped\" like a single line, [[Susan Haack]] has argued that it is more like a crossword puzzle, with multiple lines mutually supporting each other.<ref>{{cite book | title = Evidence, and Inquiry: Towards Reconstruction in Epistemology |first=Susan|last=Haack |authorlink=Susan Haack| publisher = Wiley-Blackwell | year = 1993 | isbn=978-0-631-19679-2}}</ref>\n* Infinitism\nAn alternative resolution to the regress problem is known as \"[[infinitism]].\" Infinitists take the infinite series to be merely potential, in the sense that an individual may have indefinitely many reasons available to them, without having consciously thought through all of these reasons when the need arises. This position is motivated in part by the desire to avoid what is seen as the arbitrariness and circularity of its chief competitors, foundationalism, and coherentism.\n\n==Branches or schools of thought==\n\n===Historical===\n\nThe historical study of philosophical epistemology is the historical study of efforts to gain philosophical understanding or knowledge of the nature and scope of human knowledge.<ref name=\"History of Epistemology\">{{cite journal|last=Stroud|first=Barry|title=The History of Epistemology|journal=Erkenntnis|year=2011|volume=75|issue=3|pages=495\u2013503|doi=10.1007/s10670-011-9337-4}}</ref> Since efforts to get that kind of understanding have a history, the questions philosophical epistemology asks today about human knowledge are not necessarily the same as they once were.<ref name=\"History of Epistemology\"/> But that does not mean that philosophical epistemology is itself a historical subject, or that it pursues only or even primarily historical understanding.<ref name=\"History of Epistemology\"/>\n\n===Empiricism===\n{{Main|Empiricism}}\n\nIn philosophy, [[empiricism]] is generally a theory of knowledge focusing on the role of experience, especially experience based on [[perception|perceptual observations]] by the [[sense]]s.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Psillos|first1=Stathis|last2=Curd|first2=Martin|title=The Routledge companion to philosophy of science|date=2010|publisher=Routledge|location=London|isbn=978-0-415-54613-3|pages=129\u2013138|edition=1. publ. in paperback}}</ref> Certain forms exempt disciplines such as [[mathematics]] and [[logic]] from these requirements.<ref name=\"Uebel2015\">{{cite book|last=Uebel|first=Thomas|title=Empiricism at the Crossroads: The Vienna Circle's Protocol-Sentence Debate Revisited|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=nq-6CgAAQBAJ&pg=PA14|year=2015|publisher=Open Court|isbn=978-0-8126-9929-6|page=14}}</ref>\n\nThere are many variants of empiricism: [[positivism]], [[philosophical realism|realism]], and [[common sense]] being among the most commonly expounded.

For Bachelard, rationalism makes a similar reference to all three systems of thinking.\n\n===Constructivism===\n\n[[Constructivist epistemology|Constructivism]] is a view in philosophy according to which all \"knowledge is a compilation of human-made constructions,\" <ref>Raskin, J.D.

Peirce formulates the maxim: 'Consider what effects, that might conceivably have practical bearings, we conceive the object of our conception to have. Then, our conception of these effects is the whole of our conception of the object.'<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.peirce.org/writings/p119.html | title=How to Make Our Ideas Clear}}</ref> This suggests that we are to analyze ideas and objects in the world for their practical value. This is in contrast to any [[correspondence theory of truth]] that holds that what is true is what corresponds to an external reality. William James suggests that through a pragmatist epistemology 'Theories thus become instruments, not answers to enigmas in which we can rest.'<ref>James, W. and Gunn, G. (2000).

It suggests a more empirical approach to the subject as a whole\u2014leaving behind philosophical definitions and consistency arguments, and instead of using psychological methods to study and understand how knowledge forms and is used in the natural world.  As such, it does not attempt to answer the analytic questions of traditional epistemology but replace them with new empirical ones.\n\n===Indian pramana===\n{{Main|Pramana}}\n[[Indian philosophy|Indian philosophical schools]] such as the Hindu [[Nyaya]], and [[Carvaka]], and later, the [[Jain philosophy|Jain]] and [[Buddhist philosophy|Buddhist philosophical]] schools, developed an epistemological tradition termed \"pramana\" independently of the Western philosophical tradition. Pramana can be translated as an \"instrument of knowledge\" and refers to various means or sources of knowledge that Indian philosophers held to be reliable. Each school of Indian philosophy had their theories about which pramanas were valid means to knowledge and which were unreliable (and why).<ref>James Lochtefeld, \"Pramana\" in The Illustrated Encyclopedia of Hinduism, Vol. 2: N\u2013Z, Rosen Publishing. {{ISBN|0-8239-2287-1}}, pp. 520\u2013521</ref> A [[Vedas|Vedic]] text, [[Taittiriya Aranyaka|Taittir\u012bya \u0100ra\u1e47yaka]] (c. 9th\u20136th centuries BCE), lists \"four means of attaining correct knowledge\": ''sm\u1e5bti'' (\"tradition\" or \"scripture\"), ''pratyak\u1e63a'' (\"perception\"), ''aitihya'' (\"communication by one who is expert\", or \"tradition), and ''anum\u0101na'' (\"reasoning\" or \"inference\").<ref>A.B.

Skepticism does not refer to anyone specific school of philosophy, and rather it is a thread that runs through many philosophical discussions of epistemology. [[Philosophical_skepticism#Ancient_Greek_skepticism|Ancient Greek skepticism]] begins with [[Pyrrho]] and the [[Hellenistic philosophy|Hellenistic philosophies]] of [[Pyrrhonism]] and [[Academic Skepticism]]. In Indian philosophy, [[Sanjaya Belatthiputta]] was a famous skeptic, and the Buddhist [[Madhyamika]] school has been seen as taking up a form of skepticism. [[Descartes]]' most famous inquiry into mind and body also began as an exercise in skepticism. Descartes began by questioning the validity of all knowledge and looking for some fact that was irrefutable. In so doing, he came to his famous dictum: [[I think; therefore, I am]].\n\n[[Foundationalism]] and the other responses to the regress problem are essentially defenses against skepticism. Similarly, the [[pragmatism]] of [[William James]] can be viewed as a [[coherentist]] defense against skepticism. James discarded conventional philosophical views of truth and defined truth as based on how well a concept works in a specific context, rather than objective, rational criteria. The philosophy of [[Logical Positivism]] and the work of philosophers such as [[Thomas Samuel Kuhn|Kuhn]] and [[Karl Popper|Popper]] can be viewed as skepticism applied to what can truly be considered scientific knowledge.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Popkin|first1=Richard|editor1-last=Edwards|editor1-first=Paul|title=Encyclopedia of Philosophy Volume 7|date=1972|publisher=Macmillan|isbn=978-0-02-864651-0|pages=449\u2013461|chapter=Skepticism}}</ref>\n\n==The problem of skepticism==\n[[Skepticism]] questions whether knowledge is possible at all. Skeptics argue that [[belief]] in something does not justify whether or not it is necessarily true.<ref name=\"SKEPTICISM\">{{cite journal|title=Skepticism|journal=Encyclopedia of Empiricism|year=1997}}</ref> Characterizing knowledge as strong or weak is dependent on a person's viewpoint and their characterization of knowledge.<ref name=\"SKEPTICISM\"/> Much of our knowledge of epistemology is derived from, in particular, rational and philosophical skepticism.<ref>{{Citation|last=Klein|first=Peter|title=Skepticism|date=2015|url=https://plato.stanford.edu/archives/sum2015/entries/skepticism/|encyclopedia=The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy|editor-last=Zalta|editor-first=Edward N.|edition=Summer 2015|publisher=Metaphysics Research Lab, Stanford University|access-date=2018-10-01}}</ref>\n\nAmong other arguments, skeptics use [[Agrippa's trilemma]] (named after the [[Pyrrhonism|Pyrrhonist]] philosopher [[Agrippa the Skeptic]]) to demonstrate that certain belief could not be achieved. [[Foundationalism|Foundationalists]] have used the same ''trilemma'' argument as justification for demanding the validity of basic beliefs. Skeptics oppose what they sometimes call \"[[dogma]]tic foundationalism,\" which states that there must be some basic positions that are self-justified or beyond justification without reference to others. (One example of such foundationalism may be found in [[Spinoza]]'s ''Ethics''.) The skeptical response to this can take several approaches, including, claiming that \"basic positions\" ''must'' exist, amounts to the logical fallacy of [[argument from ignorance]] combined with the [[slippery slope]].{{Citation needed|date=March 2007}}\n\nThe [[evil demon]] skepticism described by [[Descartes]] (first described in [[Plato]]'s ''[[Allegory of the Cave]]''; with an updated version from sci-fi literature describing it as the [[brain in a vat]]) supposes that our sensory impressions may be under the control of some external power. As such, everything we see is fake, and we can never know anything about the 'real' world.  Even if these foreign powers do not exist, we still must depend on only the information provided by our senses and can, therefore, make no definite statement about anything beyond that information.\n\nThere are two different categories of epistemological skepticism, which can be referred to as \"mitigated\" and \"unmitigated\" skepticism. The two forms are contrasting but are still valid forms of [[skepticism]].  Mitigated skepticism does not accept \"strong\" or \"strict\" knowledge claims but does, however, approve specific weaker ones.  These more ineffective claims can be assigned the title of \"virtual knowledge,\" but only to justified beliefs.  Unmitigated skepticism rejects both claims of virtual knowledge and strong knowledge.<ref name=\"SKEPTICISM\"/>   Characterizing knowledge as strong, weak, virtual or genuine can be determined differently depending on a person's viewpoint as well as their characterization of knowledge.<ref name=\"SKEPTICISM\"/>Several modifications of skepticism have arisen over the years, including the following: <ref> [http://www.earlham.edu/~peters/writing/skept.htm#fideism Peter Suber, \"Classical Skepticism\"]</ref>\n\n[[Fictionalism]] would not claim to know but adheres to conclusions on some criterion such as utility, aesthetics, or other personal criteria without claiming that any conclusion is actually \"true.\"\n\nPhilosophical fideism (as opposed to religious [[Fideism]]) would assert the truth of some propositions but does so without asserting certainty.\n\nSome forms of [[pragmatism]] would accept utility as a provisional guide to truth but not necessarily a universal decision-maker.\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|Philosophy}}\n{{outline}}\n{{Wikipedia books|Epistemology}}\n{{div col|colwidth=15em}}\n* [[Andragogy]]\n* [[Epistemological rupture]]\n* [[Epistemic democracy]]\n* [[Feminist epistemology]]\n* [[G\u00f6del's incompleteness theorems]]\n* [[Gnosiology]]\n* [[Knowledge]]\n* [[Metascience]]\n* [[Methodology]]\n* [[Methods of obtaining knowledge]]\n* [[Monopolies of knowledge]]\n* [[Noology|No\u00f6logy]]\n* [[Ontology]]\n* [[Participatory epistemology]]\n* [[Pedagogy]]\n* [[Philosophy of space and time]]\n* [[Reformed epistemology]]\n* [[Scientific method]]\n* [[Self-evidence]]\n* [[Semiotics]]\n* [[Sociology of knowledge]]\n* [[Uncertainty principle]]\n* [[Virtue epistemology]]\n{{div col end}}\n\n== References ==\n=== Citations ===\n{{Reflist}}\n\n=== Sources ===\n; Works cited\n{{refbegin|40em}}\n<!-- Please order books alphabetically by the author's last name -->\n* {{cite journal | last = Annis | first = David | year = 1978 | title = A Contextualist Theory of Epistemic Justification | url = | journal = American Philosophical Quarterly | volume = 15 | issue = | pages = 213\u2013219 }}\n* [[Alfred Jules Ayer|Ayer, Alfred Jules]]. 1936.

It is analogous to the German ''Wissenschaftslehre'' (literally, theory of science) which was introduced by philosophers [[Johann Fichte]] and [[Bernard Bolzano]] in the late 18th century. The word first appeared in English in 1847 as a translation of the German in New York's ''Eclectic Magazine'' review of a philosophical novel by German author [[Jean Paul]]:<ref>{{cite book |title=Oxford English Dictionary |date=2014 |publisher=Oxford University Press |edition=3rd |chapter=Epistemology}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |last1 = anonymous| title=Jean-Paul Frederich Richter |journal=The Eclectic Magazine of Foreign Literature, Science and Art |date=Nov 1847 |volume=12 |page=317 | hdl=2027/iau.31858055206621 }}.</ref>\n\n{{Quote|text=The title of one of the principal works of Fichte is \u2032Wissenschaftslehre,\u2032 which, after the analogy of ''technology'' ... we render ''epistemology''.}}\n\nIt was properly introduced in the philosophical literature by Scottish philosopher [[James Frederick Ferrier]] in his ''Institutes of Metaphysics'' (1854):<ref>{{cite book |last1=Ferrier |first1=James Frederick |title=Institutes of metaphysic : the theory of knowing and being |date=1854 |publisher=W.

[[John Locke]] describes his ''[[An Essay Concerning Human Understanding|Essay Concerning Human Understanding]]'' (1689) as an inquiry \"into the original, certainty, and extent of human knowledge, together with the grounds and degrees of belief, opinion, and assent\".<ref>{{cite book |last1=Locke |first1=John |title=An Essay Concerning Human Understanding |chapter-url=https://archive.org/details/in.ernet.dli.2015.223061 |date=1689 |chapter=Introduction}}</ref> According to Brett Warren, the character ''Epistemon'' in [[James VI and I|King James VI of Scotland]]'s ''[[Daemonologie]]'' (1591) \"was meant to be a personification of a philosophical concept currently known as 'epistemology': the investigation into the differences of a justified belief versus its opinion.\"<ref name=\"auto\">{{cite book|last1=King James|first2=Brett|last2=Warren|title=The Annotated Daemonologie.

Some philosophers think there is an important distinction between [[Propositional knowledge|\"knowing that\"]] (know a concept), [[Know-how|\"knowing how\"]] (understand an operation), and [[Knowledge by acquaintance|\"acquaintance-knowledge\"]] (know by relation), with epistemology being primarily concerned with the first of these.<ref>John Bengson (Editor), Marc A. Moffett (Editor): Essays on Knowledge, Mind, and Action. New York: Oxford University Press. 2011</ref>\n\nWhile these distinctions are not explicit in English, they are defined explicitly in other languages (N.B. some languages related to English have been said to retain these verbs, e.g. [[Scots language|Scots]]: {{lang|sco|wit}} and {{lang|sco|[[wikt:ken#Scots|ken]]}}). In French, Portuguese, Spanish, German and Dutch 'to know (a person)' is translated using {{lang|fr|conna\u00eetre}}, {{lang|pt|conhecer}}, {{lang|es|conocer}} and {{lang|de|kennen}} (both German and Dutch) respectively, whereas 'to know (how to do something)' is translated using {{lang|fr|savoir}}, {{lang|es|saber}} (both Portuguese and Spanish), {{lang|de|wissen}}, and {{lang|nl|weten}}. Modern Greek has the verbs {{lang|el|\u03b3\u03bd\u03c9\u03c1\u03af\u03b6\u03c9}} ({{lang|el-Latn|gnor\u00edzo}}) and {{lang|el|\u03be\u03ad\u03c1\u03c9}} ({{lang|el-Latn|ks\u00e9ro}}). Italian has the verbs {{lang|it|conoscere}} and {{lang|it|sapere}} and the nouns for 'knowledge' are {{lang|it|conoscenza}} and {{lang|it|sapienza}}. German has the verbs {{lang|de|wissen}} and {{lang|de|kennen}}; the former implies knowing a fact, the latter knowing in the sense of being acquainted with and having a working knowledge of; there is also a noun derived from {{lang|de|kennen}}, namely {{lang|de|Erkennen}}, which has been said to imply knowledge in the form of recognition or acknowledgment.<ref>For related linguistic data, see {{cite journal |last1=Benton |first1=Matthew |title=Epistemology Personalized |journal=The Philosophical Quarterly |date=2017 |volume=67 |issue=269 |pages=813\u2013834 |doi=10.1093/pq/pqx020 |url=https://philpapers.org/rec/BENEP-3 }}, esp. Section 1.</ref> The verb itself implies a process: you have to go from one state to another, from a state of \"not-{{lang|de|erkennen}}\" to a state of true {{lang|de|erkennen}}. This verb seems the most appropriate in terms of describing the \"episteme\" in one of the modern European languages, hence the German name \"{{lang|de|[[:de:Erkenntnistheorie|Erkenntnistheorie]]}}\". The theoretical interpretation and significance of these linguistic issues remains controversial.\n\nIn his paper ''On Denoting'' and his later book ''Problems of Philosophy'' [[Bertrand Russell]] stressed the distinction between \"[[knowledge by description]]\" and \"[[knowledge by acquaintance]].\" [[Gilbert Ryle]] is also credited with stressing the distinction between knowing how and knowing that in ''[[The Concept of Mind]].'' In ''Personal Knowledge,'' [[Michael Polanyi]] argues for the epistemological relevance of knowledge how and knowledge that; using the example of the act of balance involved in riding a [[bicycle]], he suggests that the theoretical knowledge of the [[physics]] involved in maintaining a state of [[bicycle and motorcycle dynamics#Balance|balance]] cannot substitute for the practical knowledge of how to ride, and that it is important to understand how both are established and grounded. This position is essentially Ryle's, who argued that a failure to acknowledge the distinction between knowledge that and knowledge how leads to [[infinite regress]].\n\nIn recent times, epistemologists including [[Ernest Sosa|Sosa]], [[John Greco (philosopher)|Greco]], [[Jonathan Kvanvig|Kvanvig]],<ref>{{cite book |last1=Kvanvig |first1=Jonathan L. |title=The Value of Knowledge and the Pursuit of Understanding |date=2003 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |isbn=9781139442282 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ILTIEjvbeLoC |language=en}}{{page needed|date=March 2019}}</ref> [[Linda Trinkaus Zagzebski|Zagzebski]] and Duncan Pritchard have argued that epistemology should evaluate people's \"properties\" (i.e., intellectual virtues) and not just the properties of propositions or of propositional mental attitudes.{{Citation needed|date=May 2012}}\n\n===Belief===\n{{Main|Belief}}\nIn common speech, a \"statement of belief\" is typically an expression of faith or trust in a person, power, or other entity. While it includes such traditional views, epistemology is also concerned with what we believe. This includes 'the truth' and everything else we accept as 'true' for ourselves from a cognitive point of view.{{cn|date=February 2020}}\n\n===Truth===\n{{Main|Truth}}\n{{See also|Criteria of truth}}\nWhether someone's belief is true is not a prerequisite for (its) belief.{{citation needed|date=August 2019}} On the other hand, if something is actually ''known'', then it categorically cannot be false.{{citation needed|date=August 2019}} For example, if a person believes that a bridge is safe enough to support her and attempts to cross it, but the bridge then collapses under her weight, it could be said that she ''believed'' that the bridge was safe but that her belief was mistaken. It would ''not'' be accurate to say that she ''knew'' that the bridge was safe, because it was not. By contrast, if the bridge supported her weight, then the person might say that she had believed the bridge was safe, whereas now, after proving it to herself (by crossing it), she ''knows'' it was safe.{{citation needed|date=August 2019}}{{Original research inline|date=August 2019}}\n\nEpistemologists argue over whether a belief is the proper [[truth-bearer]]. Some would rather describe knowledge as a system of justified true [[propositions]], and others as a system of justified true sentences. Plato, in his [[Gorgias_(dialogue)|Gorgias]], argues that belief is the most commonly invoked truth-bearer.<ref>{{Cite book |url=http://www.gutenberg.org/files/1672/1672-h/1672-h.htm |title=Gorgias |author=<!--Not stated--> |date=5 October 2008 |website=Project Gutenberg |publisher= |access-date=31 March 2017 |quote=}}</ref>\n\n===Justification===\nIn the ''[[Theaetetus (dialogue)|Theaetetus]]'', [[Socrates]] considers several theories as to what knowledge is, the last being that knowledge is true belief \"with an account\" (meaning explained or defined in some way). According to the theory that knowledge is justified true belief, to know that a given proposition is true, one must not only believe the relevant true proposition but also have a good reason for doing so.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Benardete |first1=Seth |title=The Being of the Beautiful |date=1984 |publisher=The University of Chicago Press |location=Chicago |isbn=978-0-226-67038-6 |page=I.169}}</ref> One implication of this would be that no one would gain knowledge just by believing something that happened to be true.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Benardete |first1=Seth |title=The Being of the Beautiful |date=1984 |publisher=The University of Chicago Press |location=Chicago |isbn=978-0-226-67038-6 |page=I.175}}</ref> For example, an ill person with no medical training, but with a generally optimistic attitude, might believe that he will recover from his illness quickly. Nevertheless, even if this belief turned out to be true, the patient would not have ''known'' that he would get well since his belief lacked justification.{{citation needed|date=August 2019}}{{Original research inline|date=August 2019}}\n\nThe definition of knowledge as the justified true belief was widely accepted until the 1960s.{{citation needed|date=August 2019}} At this time, a paper written by the American philosopher [[Edmund Gettier]] provoked significant widespread discussion. (See [[theory of justification|theories of justification]] for other views on the idea.)\n\n===Gettier problem===\n{{Main|Gettier problem}}\n[[File:Classical definition of Kno.svg|thumb|[[Euler diagram]] representing a definition of knowledge.{{citation needed|date=August 2019}}{{Original research inline|date=August 2019}}]]\n[[Edmund Gettier]] is best known for his 1963 paper entitled ''Is Justified True Belief Knowledge?'', which called into question the concept of knowledge as justified true belief.<ref name=gettier>\n{{cite journal\n|author=Gettier, Edmund\n|year= 1963\n|title=Is Justified True Belief Knowledge?\n|jstor=3326922\n|journal = Analysis\n|volume = 23\n|issue=6\n|pages=121\u2013123\n|doi = 10.2307/3326922\n|url= https://halshs.archives-ouvertes.fr/halshs-01439314/file/2013%20Gettier%20Conocimiento.pdf\n}}</ref> In a few pages, Gettier argued that there are situations in which one's belief may be justified and true, yet fail to count as knowledge. That is, Gettier contended that while justified belief in a true proposition is necessary for that proposition to be known, it is not sufficient. As in the diagram, a true proposition can be believed by an individual (purple region) but still not fall within the \"knowledge\" category (yellow region).\n\nAccording to Gettier, there are certain circumstances in which one does not have the knowledge, even when all of the above conditions are met. Gettier proposed two [[thought experiment]]s, which have become known as ''Gettier cases'', as [[counterexample]]s to the classical account of knowledge. One of the cases involves two men, Smith and Jones, who are awaiting the results of their applications for the same job. Each man has ten coins in his pocket. Smith has excellent reasons to believe that Jones will get the job and knows that Jones has ten coins in his pocket (he recently counted them). From this, Smith infers, \"The man who will get the job has ten coins in his pocket.\" However, Smith is unaware that he also has ten coins in his pocket. Furthermore, Smith, not Jones, is going to get the job. While Smith has strong evidence to believe that Jones will get the job, he is wrong. Smith has a justified true belief that the man who will get the job has ten coins in his pocket; however, according to Gettier, Smith does not ''know'' that the man who will get the job has ten coins in his pocket, because Smith's belief is \"...true by the number of coins in ''Jones's'' pocket, while Smith does not know how many coins are in Smith's pocket, and bases his belief...on a count of the coins in Jones's pocket, whom he falsely believes to be the man who will get the job.\" (see<ref name = gettier/> p.&nbsp;122.) These cases fail to be knowledge because the subject's belief is justified but only happens to be true by luck. In other words, he made the correct choice (believing that the man who will get the job has ten coins in his pocket) for the wrong reasons. This example is similar to those often given when discussing belief and truth\u2014wherein a person's belief of what will happen can coincidentally be correct without the actual knowledge to base it on.\n\n====Responses to Gettier====\n{{Unreferenced section|date=November 2015}}\nThe responses to Gettier have been varied. Usually, they have involved substantial attempts to define knowledge different from the classical one, either by recasting knowledge as justified true belief with some additional fourth condition or proposing a completely new set of conditions disregarding the classical ones entirely.\n\n=====Infallibilism, indefeasibility=====\nIn one response to Gettier, the American philosopher [[Richard Kirkham]] has argued that the only definition of knowledge that could ever be immune to all counterexamples is the [[infallibilism|infallibilist]] one.<ref>{{cite journal | url=http://www.centenary.edu/attachments/philosophy/aizawa/courses/epistemologyf2008/kirkham1984.pdf | title=Does the Gettier Problem Rest on a Mistake? | author=Richard L.

In other words, the justification for the belief must be infallible.\n\nYet another possible candidate for the fourth condition of knowledge is ''indefeasibility.'' [[Defeasibility]] theory maintains that there should be no overriding or defeating truths for the reasons that justify one's belief. For example, suppose that person ''S'' believes he saw Tom Grabit steal a book from the library and uses this to substantiate the claim that Tom Grabit took a book from the library. A possible defeater or overriding proposition for such a claim could be a true proposition like, \"Tom Grabit's identical twin Sam is currently in the same town as Tom.\" When no defeaters of one's justification exist, a subject would be epistemologically justified.\n\nThe Indian philosopher [[Bimal Krishna Matilal|B.K. Matilal]] has drawn on the [[Navya-Ny\u0101ya]] [[fallibilism]] tradition to respond to the Gettier problem. Nyaya theory distinguishes between ''know p,'' and ''know that one knows p''\u2014these are different events, with different causal conditions. The second level is a sort of implicit inference that usually follows immediately the episode of knowing p (knowledge ''simpliciter''). The Gettier case is examined by referring to a view of [[Gangesha Upadhyaya]] (late 12th century), who takes any true belief to be knowledge; thus, a true belief acquired through a wrong route may just be regarded as knowledge simpliciter on this view. The question of justification arises only at the second level when one considers the knowledge-hood of the acquired belief. Initially, there is a lack of uncertainty, so it becomes a true belief. But at the very next moment, when the hearer is about to embark upon the venture of ''knowing whether he knows p'', doubts may arise. \"If, in\nsome Gettier-like cases, I am wrong in my inference about the knowledge-hood of the given occurrent belief (for the evidence may be pseudo-evidence).

According to reliabilism, a belief is justified (or otherwise supported in such a way as to count towards knowledge) only if it is produced by processes that typically yield a sufficiently high ratio of true to false beliefs. In other words, this theory states that a true belief counts as knowledge only if a reliable belief-forming process produces it. Examples of reliable processes include standard perceptual processes, remembering, good reasoning, and introspection.<ref>{{cite book | last1=Goldman | first1=Alvin I. | editor1-first=G.S.| editor1-last=Pappas |title=Justification and Knowledge | publisher=Reidel | location=Dordrecht, Holland | date=1979 | page=11 |chapter=Reliabilism: What Is Justified Belief? | isbn=978-90-277-1024-6}}</ref>\n\nGettier cases have challenged reliabilism. {{anchor|Henry and the barn fa\u00e7ades}}Another argument that challenges reliabilism, like the Gettier cases (although it was not presented in the same short article as the Gettier cases), is the case of Henry and the barn fa\u00e7ades. In the thought experiment, a man, Henry, is driving along and sees several buildings that resemble barns. Based on his perception of one of these, he concludes that he has just seen barns. While he has seen one, and the perception he based his belief that the one he saw was of a real barn, all the other [[barn]]-like buildings he saw were fa\u00e7ades. Theoretically, Henry does not know that he has seen a barn, despite both his belief that he has seen one being true and his belief being formed on the basis of a reliable process (i.e., his vision) since he only acquired his true belief by accident.<ref>{{cite journal |title=Appearing as Irreducible in Perception |first=Alan H. |last=Goldman |author-link= Alan H.

His belief via the method of the courtroom satisfies the four subjunctive conditions, but his faith-based belief does not. If his daughter were guilty, he would still believe her innocence, based on faith in his daughter; this would violate the third condition.\n\nThe British philosopher [[Simon Blackburn]] has criticized this formulation by suggesting that we do not want to accept as knowledge beliefs which, while they \"track the truth\" (as Nozick's account requires), are not held for appropriate reasons. He says that \"we do not want to award the title of knowing something to someone who is only meeting the conditions through a defect, flaw, or failure, compared with someone else who is not meeting the conditions.\"<ref name=\"Think: A compelling introduction to philosophy\">{{cite book |last=Blackburn|first=Simon|title=Think: A compelling introduction to philosophy|url=https://archive.org/details/thinkcompellingi00bla_kzi|url-access=registration|year=1999|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-976984-1}}</ref> In addition to this, externalist accounts of knowledge, such as Nozick's, are often forced to reject closure in cases where it is intuitively valid.\n\n[[Timothy Williamson]] has advanced a theory of knowledge according to which knowledge is not justified true belief plus some other condition(s), but primary. In his book ''[[Knowledge and its Limits]],'' Williamson argues that the concept of knowledge cannot be broken down into a set of other ideas through analysis. Instead, it is ''[[sui generis]].'' Thus, according to Williamson, justification, truth, and belief are [[Necessary and sufficient|necessary but not sufficient]] for knowledge.\n\n[[Alvin Goldman]] writes in his \"[[Causal Theory of Knowledge|Causal Theory of Knowing]]\" that knowledge requires a [[Causal chain|causal link]] between the truth of a proposition and the belief in that proposition.\n\n===Externalism and internalism===\n{{Main|Internalism, and externalism}}\nA central debate about the nature of justification is a debate between epistemological externalists on the one hand and epistemological internalists on the other.\n\nExternalists hold that factors deemed \"external,\" meaning outside of the psychological states of those who gain knowledge, can be conditions of justification. For example, an externalist response to the Gettier problem is to say that for a justified true belief to count as knowledge; there must be a link or dependency between the belief and the state of the external world. Usually, this is understood to be a causal link. Such causation, to the extent that it is \"outside\" the mind, would count as an external, knowledge-yielding condition. Internalists, on the other hand, assert that all knowledge-yielding conditions are within the psychological states of those who gain knowledge.\n\nThough unfamiliar with the internalist/externalist debate himself, many point to [[Ren\u00e9 Descartes]] as an early example of the internalist path to justification. He wrote that because the only method by which we perceive the external world is through our senses, and that, because the senses are not infallible, we should not consider our concept of knowledge infallible. The only way to find anything that could be described as \"indubitably true,\" he advocates, would be to see things \"clearly and distinctly.\" <ref name=Regulae>{{cite book |last=Descartes|first=Rene|title=The Philosophical Writings of Rene Descartes Vol. I|year=1985|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0-521-28807-1}}</ref> He argued that if there is an omnipotent, good being who made the world, then it's reasonable to believe that people are made with the ability to know. However, this does not mean that man's ability to know is perfect. God gave man the ability to know but not with omniscience. Descartes said that man must use his capacities for knowledge correctly and carefully through methodological doubt.<ref name=\"Meditations on First Philosophy\">{{cite book |last=Descartes|first=Rene|title=Philosophical Writings of Rene Descartes Vol. II|year=1985|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0-521-28808-8}}</ref>\n\nThe dictum \"Cogito ergo sum\" (I think; therefore I am) is also commonly associated with Descartes' theory. In his methodological doubt\u2014doubting everything he previously knew so he could start from a blank slate\u2014the first thing that he could not logically bring himself to doubt was his existence: \"I do not exist\" would be a contradiction in terms. The act of saying that one does not exist assumes that someone must be making the statement in the first place. Descartes could doubt his senses, his body, and the world around him\u2014but he could not deny his existence, because he was able to doubt and must exist to manifest that doubt. Even if some \"evil genius\" were deceiving him, he would have to exist to be deceived. This one sure point provided him with what he called his Archimedean point, to further develop his foundation for knowledge. Simply put, Descartes' epistemological justification depended on his indubitable belief in his own existence and his clear and distinct knowledge of God.<ref name=Refutations>{{cite book |last=Descartes|first=Rene|title=The Philosophical Writings of Rene Descartes|year=1985|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0-521-28808-8}}</ref>\n\n===Value problem===\nWe generally assume that knowledge is more valuable than mere true belief. If so, what is the explanation? A formulation of the value problem in epistemology first occurs in [[Plato]]'s Meno. Socrates points out to Meno that a man who knew the way to Larissa could lead others there correctly. But so, too, could a man who had true beliefs about how to get there, even if he had not gone there or had any knowledge of Larissa. Socrates says that it seems that both knowledge and true opinion can guide action. Meno then wonders why knowledge is valued more than true belief and why knowledge and true belief are different. Socrates responds that knowledge is more valuable than mere true belief because it is tethered or justified. Justification, or working out the reason for a true belief, locks down true belief.<ref>{{cite book | last1=Plato | title=Five Dialogues | date=2002 | publisher=Hackett Pub.

Zagzebski analogizes the value of knowledge to the value of espresso produced by an espresso maker: \"The liquid in this cup is not improved by the fact that it comes from a reliable espresso maker. If the espresso tastes good, it makes no difference if it comes from an unreliable machine.\"<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Zagzebski|first1=Linda|title=The Search for the Source of Epistemic Good|journal=Metaphilosophy|volume=34|issue=1/2|page=13|url=https://philpapers.org/archive/ZAGTFE.pdf}}</ref> For Zagzebski, the value of knowledge deflates to the value of mere true belief. She assumes that reliability in itself has no value or disvalue, but Goldman and Olsson disagree. They point out that Zagzebski's conclusion rests on the assumption of veritism: all that matters is the acquisition of true belief.<ref>{{cite book | last1=Goldman | first1=Alvin I. | last2=Olsson| first2=E.J. | editor1-first=A. | editor1-last=Haddock | editor2-first=A. | editor2-last=Millar | editor3-first=D.| editor3-last=Pritchard |title=Epistemic Value | publisher=Oxford University Press | date=2009 | page=24 |chapter=Reliabilism and the Value of Knowledge |isbn=978-0-19-923118-8 | lastauthoramp=y}}</ref> To the contrary, they argue that a careful process for acquiring a true belief adds value to the mere true belief by making it more likely that future beliefs of a similar kind will be true. By analogy, having a reliable espresso maker that produced a good cup of espresso would be more valuable than having an unreliable one that luckily produced a good cup because the reliable one would more likely produce good future cups compared to the unreliable one.\n\nThe value problem is important for assessing the adequacy of theories of knowledge that conceive of knowledge as consisting of true belief and other components. According to [[Jonathan Kvanvig|Kvanvig]], an adequate account of knowledge should resist counterexamples and allow an explanation of the value of knowledge over mere true belief. Should a theory of knowledge fail to do so, it would prove inadequate.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Kvanvig|first1=Jonathan|title=The Value of Knowledge and the Pursuit of Understanding|date=2003|publisher=Cambridge University Press|location=Cambridge; New York | isbn=978-0-521-03786-0 | page=5}}</ref>\n\nOne of the more influential responses to the problem is that knowledge is not particularly valuable and is not what ought to be the main focus of epistemology. Instead, epistemologists ought to focus on other mental states, such as understanding.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Kvanvig|first1=Jonathan|title=The Value of Knowledge and the Pursuit of Understanding|date=2003|publisher=Cambridge University Press|location=Cambridge; New York| isbn=978-0-521-03786-0 }}</ref> Advocates of virtue epistemology have argued that the value of knowledge comes from an internal relationship between the knower and the mental state of believing.<ref name=\"SEPValue\" />\n\n==Acquiring knowledge==\n===''A priori'' and ''a posteriori'' knowledge===\n{{Main|A priori and a posteriori}}\nVarious philosophers have disputed the nature of this distinction; however, the terms may be roughly defined as follows:\n* ''[[A priori and a posteriori|A priori]]'' knowledge is the knowledge that is known independently of experience (that is, it is non-empirical, or arrived at beforehand, usually by reason). It will henceforth be acquired through anything independent from experience.\n* ''[[Empirical evidence|A posteriori]]'' knowledge is the knowledge that is known by experience (that is, it is empirical, or arrived at afterward).\nA priori knowledge is a way of gaining knowledge without the need for experience.  In Bruce Russell's article \"A Priori Justification and Knowledge\"<ref>Russell, Bruce, \"A Priori Justification and Knowledge,\" The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy (Summer 2014 Edition), Edward N. Zalta (ed.), URL = <http://plato.stanford.edu/archives/sum2014/entries/apriori/>.</ref> he says that it is \"knowledge based on a priori justification,\" (1) which relies on intuition and the nature of these intuitions.  A priori knowledge is often contrasted with posteriori knowledge, which is knowledge gained by experience.  A way to look at the difference between the two is through an example. Bruce Russell gives two propositions in which the reader decides which one he believes more.  Option A: All crows are birds.  Option B: All crows are black.  If you believe option A, then you are a priori justified in believing it because you don't have to see a crow to know it's a bird.  If you believe in option B, then you are posteriori justified to believe it because you have seen many crows, therefore, knowing they are black.  He goes on to say that it doesn't matter if the statement is true or not, only that if you believe in one or the other that matters.\n\nThe idea of a priori knowledge is that it is based on intuition or rational insights.  Laurence BonJour says in his article \"The Structure of Empirical Knowledge,\" <ref>BonJour, Laurence, 1985, The Structure of Empirical Knowledge, Cambridge, MA: Harvard University Press.</ref> that a \"rational insight is an immediate, non-inferential grasp, apprehension or 'seeing' that some proposition is necessarily true.\" (3) Going back to the crow example, by Laurence BonJour's definition, the reason you would believe in option A is that you have a direct knowledge that a crow is a bird, without ever experiencing one.\n\n[[Evolutionary psychology]] takes a novel approach to the problem. It says that there is an innate predisposition for certain types of learning. \"Only small parts of the brain resemble a [[tabula rasa]]; this is true even for human beings. The remainder is more like an exposed negative waiting to be dipped into a developer fluid\".<ref>Wilson, E.O., [[Sociobiology: The New Synthesis]]. Cambridge, Massachusetts: The Belknap Press of Harvard University Press. 1975</ref>\n\n===Analytic\u2013synthetic distinction===\n{{Main|Analytic\u2013synthetic distinction}}\n[[Immanuel Kant]], in his ''[[Critique of Pure Reason]]'', drew a distinction between \"analytic\" and \"synthetic\" propositions. He contended that some propositions are such that we can know they are true just by understanding their meaning. For example, consider, \"My father's brother is my uncle.\" We can know it is true solely by our understanding of what its terms mean. Philosophers call such propositions ''analytic\"''. Synthetic propositions, on the other hand, have distinct subjects and predicates. An example would be, \"My father's brother has black hair.\" Kant stated that all mathematical and scientific statements are analytic priori propositions because they are [[logical truth|necessarily true]] but our knowledge about the attributes of the mathematical or physical subjects we can only get by logical inference.\n\nThe American philosopher [[Willard Van Orman Quine]], in his ''[[Two Dogmas of Empiricism]]'', famously challenged the distinction, arguing that the two have a blurry boundary. Some contemporary philosophers have offered more sustainable accounts of the distinction.<ref>Russell, G.: Truth in Virtue of Meaning: A Defence of the Analytic/Synthetic Distinction. Oxford: Oxford University Press. 2008</ref>\n\n=== Science as knowledge acquisition ===\n{{Main|Philosophy of Science}}\n\nScience is viewed as a refined, formalized, systematic, or institutionalized form of the pursuit and acquisition of empirical knowledge. As such, the [[philosophy of science]] may be viewed variously as an application or foundation of the philosophy of knowledge acquisition.\n\n==Regress problem==\n{{Main|Regress argument}}\n\nThe regress problem is the problem of providing a complete logical foundation for human knowledge. The traditional way of supporting a rational argument is to appeal to other rational arguments, typically using chains of reason and rules of logic. A classic example that goes back to Aristotle is deducing that ''Socrates is mortal.'' We have a logical rule that says, ''All humans are mortal'' and an assertion that ''Socrates is human'' and we deduce that ''Socrates is mortal''. In this example, how do we know that Socrates is human? Presumably, we apply other rules such as:  ''All born from human females are human.'' Which then leaves open the question of how do we know that all born from humans are human? This is the regress problem: how can we eventually terminate a logical argument with some statement(s) that do not require further justification but can still be considered rational and justified? As John Pollock stated:\n\n<blockquote>... to justify a belief, one must appeal to a further justified belief. This means that one of two things can be the case. Either there are some beliefs that we can be justified for holding, without being able to justify them based on any other belief, or else for each justified belief, there is an infinite regress of (potential) justification [the nebula theory]. In this theory, there is no rock bottom of justification. Justification just meanders in and out through our network of beliefs, stopping nowhere.<ref name=Pollock>\n{{cite book\n| author =      John L. Pollock\n| title =      Knowledge, and Justification\n| publisher =      Princeton University Press, Princeton, New Jersey\n| year =      1975\n| ISBN =      978-0-691-07203-6\n| Url =      https://archive.org/details/knowledgejustifi0000poll\n}} p. 26.</ref></blockquote>\n\nThe apparent impossibility of completing an infinite chain of reasoning is thought by some to support [[skepticism]]. It is also the impetus for Descartes' famous dictum: ''[[I think; therefore I am]]''. Descartes was looking for some logical statements that could be true without appeal to other explanations.\n\n===Response to the regress problem===\n\nMany epistemologists studying justification have attempted to argue for various types of chains of reasoning that can escape the regress problem.\n* Foundationalism\n[[Foundationalism|Foundationalists]] respond to the regress problem by asserting that certain \"foundations\" or \"basic beliefs\" support other beliefs but do not themselves require justification from different views. These beliefs might be justified because they are self-evident, infallible, or derive from reliable cognitive mechanisms. Perception, memory, and a priori intuition are often considered possible examples of fundamental beliefs.\n\nThe chief criticism of foundationalism is that if other beliefs do not support a belief, accepting it may be arbitrary or unjustified.<ref>{{cite SEP |url-id=justep-foundational |title=Foundational Theories of Epistemic Justification}}</ref>\n* Coherentism\nAnother response to the regress problem is [[coherentism]], which is the rejection of the assumption that the regress proceeds according to a pattern of linear justification. To avoid the charge of circularity, [[coherentism|coherentists]] hold that an individual belief is justified circularly by the way it fits together (coheres) with the rest of the belief system of which it is a part. This theory has the advantage of avoiding the infinite regress without claiming special, possibly arbitrary status for some particular class of beliefs. Yet, since a system can be coherent while also being wrong, coherentists face the difficulty of ensuring that the whole system [[correspondence theory of truth|corresponds]] to reality. Additionally, most logicians agree that any circular argument is, at best, only trivially valid. That is, to be illuminating, arguments must operate with information from multiple premises, not simply conclude by reiterating a premise.\n\nWarburton writes in ''Thinking from A to Z'', \"Circular arguments are not invalid; in other words, from a logical point of view, there is nothing intrinsically wrong with them. However, they are, when viciously circular, spectacularly uninformative.\" (Warburton 1996)\n* Foundherentism\nA position is known as ''[[foundherentism]]'', advanced by [[Susan Haack]], is meant to unify foundationalism and coherentism. One component of this theory is what is called the \"analogy of the crossword puzzle.\" Whereas, for example, infinitists regard the regress of reasons as \"shaped\" like a single line, [[Susan Haack]] has argued that it is more like a crossword puzzle, with multiple lines mutually supporting each other.<ref>{{cite book | title = Evidence, and Inquiry: Towards Reconstruction in Epistemology |first=Susan|last=Haack |authorlink=Susan Haack| publisher = Wiley-Blackwell | year = 1993 | isbn=978-0-631-19679-2}}</ref>\n* Infinitism\nAn alternative resolution to the regress problem is known as \"[[infinitism]].\" Infinitists take the infinite series to be merely potential, in the sense that an individual may have indefinitely many reasons available to them, without having consciously thought through all of these reasons when the need arises. This position is motivated in part by the desire to avoid what is seen as the arbitrariness and circularity of its chief competitors, foundationalism, and coherentism.\n\n==Branches or schools of thought==\n\n===Historical===\n\nThe historical study of philosophical epistemology is the historical study of efforts to gain philosophical understanding or knowledge of the nature and scope of human knowledge.<ref name=\"History of Epistemology\">{{cite journal|last=Stroud|first=Barry|title=The History of Epistemology|journal=Erkenntnis|year=2011|volume=75|issue=3|pages=495\u2013503|doi=10.1007/s10670-011-9337-4}}</ref> Since efforts to get that kind of understanding have a history, the questions philosophical epistemology asks today about human knowledge are not necessarily the same as they once were.<ref name=\"History of Epistemology\"/> But that does not mean that philosophical epistemology is itself a historical subject, or that it pursues only or even primarily historical understanding.<ref name=\"History of Epistemology\"/>\n\n===Empiricism===\n{{Main|Empiricism}}\n\nIn philosophy, [[empiricism]] is generally a theory of knowledge focusing on the role of experience, especially experience based on [[perception|perceptual observations]] by the [[sense]]s.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Psillos|first1=Stathis|last2=Curd|first2=Martin|title=The Routledge companion to philosophy of science|date=2010|publisher=Routledge|location=London|isbn=978-0-415-54613-3|pages=129\u2013138|edition=1. publ. in paperback}}</ref> Certain forms exempt disciplines such as [[mathematics]] and [[logic]] from these requirements.<ref name=\"Uebel2015\">{{cite book|last=Uebel|first=Thomas|title=Empiricism at the Crossroads: The Vienna Circle's Protocol-Sentence Debate Revisited|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=nq-6CgAAQBAJ&pg=PA14|year=2015|publisher=Open Court|isbn=978-0-8126-9929-6|page=14}}</ref>\n\nThere are many variants of empiricism: [[positivism]], [[philosophical realism|realism]], and [[common sense]] being among the most commonly expounded.

Pramana can be translated as an \"instrument of knowledge\" and refers to various means or sources of knowledge that Indian philosophers held to be reliable. Each school of Indian philosophy had their theories about which pramanas were valid means to knowledge and which were unreliable (and why).<ref>James Lochtefeld, \"Pramana\" in The Illustrated Encyclopedia of Hinduism, Vol. 2: N\u2013Z, Rosen Publishing. {{ISBN|0-8239-2287-1}}, pp. 520\u2013521</ref> A [[Vedas|Vedic]] text, [[Taittiriya Aranyaka|Taittir\u012bya \u0100ra\u1e47yaka]] (c. 9th\u20136th centuries BCE), lists \"four means of attaining correct knowledge\": ''sm\u1e5bti'' (\"tradition\" or \"scripture\"), ''pratyak\u1e63a'' (\"perception\"), ''aitihya'' (\"communication by one who is expert\", or \"tradition), and ''anum\u0101na'' (\"reasoning\" or \"inference\").<ref>A.B.

Skepticism does not refer to anyone specific school of philosophy, and rather it is a thread that runs through many philosophical discussions of epistemology. [[Philosophical_skepticism#Ancient_Greek_skepticism|Ancient Greek skepticism]] begins with [[Pyrrho]] and the [[Hellenistic philosophy|Hellenistic philosophies]] of [[Pyrrhonism]] and [[Academic Skepticism]]. In Indian philosophy, [[Sanjaya Belatthiputta]] was a famous skeptic, and the Buddhist [[Madhyamika]] school has been seen as taking up a form of skepticism. [[Descartes]]' most famous inquiry into mind and body also began as an exercise in skepticism. Descartes began by questioning the validity of all knowledge and looking for some fact that was irrefutable. In so doing, he came to his famous dictum: [[I think; therefore, I am]].\n\n[[Foundationalism]] and the other responses to the regress problem are essentially defenses against skepticism. Similarly, the [[pragmatism]] of [[William James]] can be viewed as a [[coherentist]] defense against skepticism. James discarded conventional philosophical views of truth and defined truth as based on how well a concept works in a specific context, rather than objective, rational criteria. The philosophy of [[Logical Positivism]] and the work of philosophers such as [[Thomas Samuel Kuhn|Kuhn]] and [[Karl Popper|Popper]] can be viewed as skepticism applied to what can truly be considered scientific knowledge.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Popkin|first1=Richard|editor1-last=Edwards|editor1-first=Paul|title=Encyclopedia of Philosophy Volume 7|date=1972|publisher=Macmillan|isbn=978-0-02-864651-0|pages=449\u2013461|chapter=Skepticism}}</ref>\n\n==The problem of skepticism==\n[[Skepticism]] questions whether knowledge is possible at all. Skeptics argue that [[belief]] in something does not justify whether or not it is necessarily true.<ref name=\"SKEPTICISM\">{{cite journal|title=Skepticism|journal=Encyclopedia of Empiricism|year=1997}}</ref> Characterizing knowledge as strong or weak is dependent on a person's viewpoint and their characterization of knowledge.<ref name=\"SKEPTICISM\"/> Much of our knowledge of epistemology is derived from, in particular, rational and philosophical skepticism.<ref>{{Citation|last=Klein|first=Peter|title=Skepticism|date=2015|url=https://plato.stanford.edu/archives/sum2015/entries/skepticism/|encyclopedia=The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy|editor-last=Zalta|editor-first=Edward N.|edition=Summer 2015|publisher=Metaphysics Research Lab, Stanford University|access-date=2018-10-01}}</ref>\n\nAmong other arguments, skeptics use [[Agrippa's trilemma]] (named after the [[Pyrrhonism|Pyrrhonist]] philosopher [[Agrippa the Skeptic]]) to demonstrate that certain belief could not be achieved. [[Foundationalism|Foundationalists]] have used the same ''trilemma'' argument as justification for demanding the validity of basic beliefs. Skeptics oppose what they sometimes call \"[[dogma]]tic foundationalism,\" which states that there must be some basic positions that are self-justified or beyond justification without reference to others. (One example of such foundationalism may be found in [[Spinoza]]'s ''Ethics''.) The skeptical response to this can take several approaches, including, claiming that \"basic positions\" ''must'' exist, amounts to the logical fallacy of [[argument from ignorance]] combined with the [[slippery slope]].{{Citation needed|date=March 2007}}\n\nThe [[evil demon]] skepticism described by [[Descartes]] (first described in [[Plato]]'s ''[[Allegory of the Cave]]''; with an updated version from sci-fi literature describing it as the [[brain in a vat]]) supposes that our sensory impressions may be under the control of some external power. As such, everything we see is fake, and we can never know anything about the 'real' world.  Even if these foreign powers do not exist, we still must depend on only the information provided by our senses and can, therefore, make no definite statement about anything beyond that information.\n\nThere are two different categories of epistemological skepticism, which can be referred to as \"mitigated\" and \"unmitigated\" skepticism. The two forms are contrasting but are still valid forms of [[skepticism]].  Mitigated skepticism does not accept \"strong\" or \"strict\" knowledge claims but does, however, approve specific weaker ones.  These more ineffective claims can be assigned the title of \"virtual knowledge,\" but only to justified beliefs.  Unmitigated skepticism rejects both claims of virtual knowledge and strong knowledge.<ref name=\"SKEPTICISM\"/>   Characterizing knowledge as strong, weak, virtual or genuine can be determined differently depending on a person's viewpoint as well as their characterization of knowledge.<ref name=\"SKEPTICISM\"/>Several modifications of skepticism have arisen over the years, including the following: <ref> [http://www.earlham.edu/~peters/writing/skept.htm#fideism Peter Suber, \"Classical Skepticism\"]</ref>\n\n[[Fictionalism]] would not claim to know but adheres to conclusions on some criterion such as utility, aesthetics, or other personal criteria without claiming that any conclusion is actually \"true.\"\n\nPhilosophical fideism (as opposed to religious [[Fideism]]) would assert the truth of some propositions but does so without asserting certainty.\n\nSome forms of [[pragmatism]] would accept utility as a provisional guide to truth but not necessarily a universal decision-maker.\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|Philosophy}}\n{{outline}}\n{{Wikipedia books|Epistemology}}\n{{div col|colwidth=15em}}\n* [[Andragogy]]\n* [[Epistemological rupture]]\n* [[Epistemic democracy]]\n* [[Feminist epistemology]]\n* [[G\u00f6del's incompleteness theorems]]\n* [[Gnosiology]]\n* [[Knowledge]]\n* [[Metascience]]\n* [[Methodology]]\n* [[Methods of obtaining knowledge]]\n* [[Monopolies of knowledge]]\n* [[Noology|No\u00f6logy]]\n* [[Ontology]]\n* [[Participatory epistemology]]\n* [[Pedagogy]]\n* [[Philosophy of space and time]]\n* [[Reformed epistemology]]\n* [[Scientific method]]\n* [[Self-evidence]]\n* [[Semiotics]]\n* [[Sociology of knowledge]]\n* [[Uncertainty principle]]\n* [[Virtue epistemology]]\n{{div col end}}\n\n== References ==\n=== Citations ===\n{{Reflist}}\n\n=== Sources ===\n; Works cited\n{{refbegin|40em}}\n<!-- Please order books alphabetically by the author's last name -->\n* {{cite journal | last = Annis | first = David | year = 1978 | title = A Contextualist Theory of Epistemic Justification | url = | journal = American Philosophical Quarterly | volume = 15 | issue = | pages = 213\u2013219 }}\n* [[Alfred Jules Ayer|Ayer, Alfred Jules]]. 1936.

She filled this existential void not only with her professional ambitions but also with the theosophical-inspired world of oriental myths and rituals and tried to be part of it by dancing and drawing what she saw. Her cognitive, mental and emotional conceptions were inspired by [[feminism]], the \"[[New Woman]]\";  and by [[exotism]], especially the [[Theosophical mysticism]] of [[Annie Besant]], [[Jiddu Krishnamurti]] and [[Charles Webster Leadbeater]]. The latter founded the [[\"Orde van de Ster in het Oosten\"]] [https://nl.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orde_van_de_Ster_in_het_Oosten]  (a so-called mixed non-Masonic lodge), which became very popular in the Netherlands and  the Dutch East Indies.<ref>Messias verwachting in onze dagen, J.H. Bolt, Amersfoort, 1926</ref>\n\n===Europe===\nWhen she moved to Rome in 1898 because she was not accepted in Paris by the Theosophic movement, she joined a theosophical society in Rome and attended its meetings and lectures. She befriended persons like [[Anna Maria Roos]] and [[Mary and Jean Karadja Pascha]].\n\n[[File:Tyra-Kleen-1912.jpg|thumb|Tyra Kleen in 1912]]\nShe spent ten years in [[Rome]] as part of the contemporary cultural elite. She met Anders and Emma Zorn, Ellen Key, Carl Milles, Helena Nygren, Hjalmar S\u00f6derberg and Ottilia Adelborg; and later also went to live in [[Berlin]] and [[Paris]]. She traveled extensively, in 1910 to [[India]] and [[Sri Lanka|Ceylon]] and in 1919\u20131921 in [[Java]] and [[Bali]], where she studied dance, being inspired in Paris by the performances of [[Mata Hari]]. She exhibited her work in Berlin, [[Vienna]], [[Milan]], [[Rome]], Paris, [[London]] and [[Saint Petersburg|St. Petersburg]].<ref>Karin Str\u00f6m Lehander, Tyra Kleen- artist and woman at the fin de si\u00e8cle.  in: Tyra Kleen, Her life and work rediscovered.Stockholm 2018, s. 50-51.</ref> She visited the [[Caribbean]] and the [[United States]] and organized an exhibition in [[New York City|New York]] in 1917. Kleen was very well equipped in organising and networking using contacts and relatives in the world of diplomacy, freemasonry, theosophy, feminism and the local magistry. She excelled at becoming intimate with people who could be useful for her career.\n\n===Asia===\nIn 1919, after WWI, she traveled to Java and Bali on a Swedish cargo ship. In Solo ([[Surakarta]]), Kleen worked with [[Beata van Helsdingen-Schoevers]] to write an anthropological study on the ritual court dances of Solo. Both also participated in the dance lessons.[https://nl.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beata_van_Helsdingen-Schoevers] Kleen felt that dancing not only involved making the right movements on the sound of music, but that it also involved the transition into an altered state of mind to become in harmony not only with oneself, but with the Universe.\n\nUnfortunately, this project ended in July 1920 in turmoil due to clashing personalities, and van Helsdingen-Schoevers died 17 August 1920 of an unknown disease.<ref>Vivian van de Loo, \"Leven tussen Kunst en Krant, [[Beata van Helsdingen-Schoevers]],[[https://nl.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beata_van_Helsdingen-Schoevers]] journaliste en declamatrice in Indi\u00eb. KITLV Leiden 2004\". pp. 142\u2013149.</ref> The project was finished in 1925 with help from \"Volkslectuur\" (the commission of folk literature), [[Mabel Fowler]] and miss Gob\u00e9e, wife of the Head of the Office for Internal Affairs, titled \"The Serimpi and Bedojo Dances at the Court of Surakarta\", with 16 pages of text. In July 1925 there appeared a new edition with 30 pages of text. The coloured plates were reproductions made by the Topographic Service of Kleen's drawings. For everyone involved, but especially Kleen, the result was very disappointing, because she wanted to participate in this project in order to result in a standard reference work that could be presented worldwide.\n\nWhen she arrived in Bali in 1920, she started a new project on the mudras, or ritual hand poses, of the Balinese Hindu priests with the assistance of the Rajah of [[Kingdom of Karangasem|Karangasem]], Gusti Bagus Djilantik, whom she had met in Solo the year before, and of [[Piet de Kat Angelino]]. This was a turning point in her career because de Kat Angelino was able to explain to her the mudras and also encouraged the priests to cooperate. He was district-officer (controleur) of Gianjar and [[Klungklung]] for over a decade and had been collecting material on Balinese priests for years in his home in Gianjar. At his home, she could draw priests and their mudras. Their work together is presented in the book ''Mudras'', with text and illustrations by Kleen, who acknowledged that much of the technical information about the poses and ceremonies came from de Kat Angelino and later on from R.Ng. Poerbatjaraka. Kleen spent the whole of 1921 in Java, working on the material collected in Bali the year before. She exhibited her pictures of the priests at the Art Society in Batavia. Collaboration with de Kat Angelino continued and she met him in Amsterdam on her way home. With his help an exhibition was arranged at the Colonial Institute in Amsterdam. The exhibition was favorably reviewed by de Kat Angelino in the magazine [[Nederlandsch Indi\u00eb, Oud en Nieuw |''Nederlandsch Indi\u00eb, Oud en Nieuw'']].\nWhat was the reaction  at that time in the Netherlands on her work in Bali?\n[[Anne Hallema]], a Dutch journalist and art-criticus  wrote a critical and extensive article on the Mudra's which appeared Elseviers Ge\u00efllustreerd Maandschrift, Jaargang 34, 1924 pp.145-147. He disqualified her work as an artist but praiserd her for her scientific contribution. \nHe ends his article with stating that we have to be grateful that this stranger from the land of Selma Lagerl\u00f6f toke the initiativ to study the mudra's of the Balinese priests in performing his Hindu\u00efstic rituals. Specially the Indologists and Ori\u00ebtalists should be happy with the appearance of this publication.\n\nAnother crucial exhibition was ''Tv\u00e5 vittberesta damer'' (Two Travelling Ladies) at [[Liljevalchs konsthall|Liljevalch's]] Public Art Gallery in Stockholm 1922, where she showed art and artifacts from [[Java]] and [[Bali]] together with Swedish photographer and author [[Ida Trotzig]] contributing works from [[Japan]]. This exhibition was the starting point for the \"Bali-fever\" in Sweden. Kleen's depictions of mudras were shown at the [[Victoria and Albert Museum]] in 1923.\n\nBesides ''Mudras'', Kleen published two other books about Bali: ''Ni-Si-Pleng, a story about black children written for white children'' (1924), and, seven years later, ''Tempeldanser och musikinstrument pa Bali'', printed in 300 numbered copies, translated in 1936 as ''The Temple Dances in Bali''.<ref>Elisabeth Lind: the pencil in the service of ethnographical research.p 91-133 in Tyra Kleen, her life and work rediscovered by Niclas Franz\u00e9n and others, Sweden 2018</ref>\n\nKleen's study on the mudras, the exhibition in Amsterdam at the Colonial Institute and the publication of her books made her internationally known. For her scientific ethnographic work on Bali, Kleen was awarded the Johan August Wahlberg silver medal in April 1938, given to individuals who have \"promoted anthropological and geographical science through outstanding efforts\".<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://ssag.se/om/stadgar-och-bestammelser/johan-august-wahlbergs-medaljfond/|title=SSAG {{!}} Svenska S\u00e4llskapet f\u00f6r Antropologi och Geografi {{!}} Johan August Wahlbergs medaljfond|website=ssag.se|language=sv-SE|access-date=2018-06-12}}</ref>\n\n[[Walter Spies]] was the central figure in the circle of artists residing on the island in Ubud, Klungklung and Karangasem. He was considered to be the greatest expert on Balinese dance and drama. Together with the British dance critic [[Beryl de Zoete]], he wrote the standard 1938 work ''Dance and Drama in Bali''. Spies was jealous of the international success of Kleen{{Citation needed|date=March 2020}} and wrote a very critical nine-page review of the ''Temple Dances in Bali'' in the journal ''Djawa'' (1939). He complained, \"the text and the depictions are filled with so many mistakes, errors and incorrect statements that one must shake one's head.\" Spies claims that as an ethnographic document the book has no value.<ref>Elisabeth Lind, The pencil in the service of ethnographical research, etc. p. 131-132,</ref> As a result, there were nearly no references to the work of Kleen in any ethnographic periodicals or publications after this critical review. It is only in 1962 that [[C. Hooykaas]] in his article \"Saiva-Siddhanta in Java and Bali\"<ref>Bijdragen tot de Taal-, Land- en Volkenkunde 118 (1962) no 3(Leiden 309-327</ref> supported the importance of the study on mudras by de Kat Angelino and Kleen.\n\nKleen contributed work to various European magazines, including ''Sluyters' Monthly'', ''Nederlandsch Indi\u00eb Oud en Nieuw'', ''Ord och Bild'' and ''Inter-Ocean'', between 1920 and 1925<ref>Haks & Maris, Lexicon of foreign artists who visualized Indonesia. (1600-1950),Singapore 1995</ref> and influenced in this way the perception and expectations of foreign visitors to Bali. Furthermore, she influenced with her colourful, vivid and dynamic art-deco drawing style the development of painting by local artists in Bali, not in a one-way influence but more a kind of mutual influence.<ref>Bruce Granquist. Inventing art: The paintings of Batuan Bali. Satumata Press, 2012</ref> Mostly these local paintings were made for the touristic market and depicted daily life instead of exclusively being concerned with gods, demons and the [[Ramayana]] and [[Mahabharata]] epics. In this way, she took part in the marketing of \"the last paradise\". This also meant that she became associated with this type of magazine drawing instead of her more important  ethnographic publications.\n\n===Egypt===\nIn 1926, Kleen visited Egypt to study the meanings of the different hand and foot movements depicted in the art, which resulted in her last publication in 1946 of the book ''Solens Son'' about pharaoh [[Akhenaten|Echnaton]].\n\n===Legacy===\n[[File:Tyra-Kleen.jpg|thumb|Tyra Kleen in the 1940s]]\nKleen left her collections to the Swedish House of Nobility on the condition that the archive would not be opened until 50 years after her death.[https://www.riddarhuset.se/tyra-kleens-samling] In 2001, the paintings, lithographs, drawings, diaries and sketches were brought out and the private part of her collection was brought home to Valinge.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.riddarhuset.se/tyra-kleens-samling/|title=Tyra Kleens samling : Riddarhuset|website=www.riddarhuset.se|language=sv-SE|access-date=2018-06-12}}</ref> Kleen is represented with art at, for instance, [[Gothenburg Museum of Art]]<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://emp-web-34.zetcom.ch/eMuseumPlus?service=ExternalInterface&module=collection&objectId=24094&viewType=detailView|title=G\u00f6teborgs konstmuseum {{!}} Orientalisk parfym|website=emp-web-34.zetcom.ch|language=sv|access-date=2018-06-12}}</ref> and [[Nationalmuseum]]<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://emp-web-84.zetcom.ch/eMP/eMuseumPlus?service=ExternalInterface&module=artist&objectId=15325&viewType=detailView|title=Nationalmuseum - Tyra Kleen|website=emp-web-84.zetcom.ch|language=en|access-date=2018-06-12}}</ref> in Stockholm.

She loved her freedom and hated to be dominated by men or women. She was very ambitious and particular in traveling and doing business. She was very productive and could work for hours, days and weeks to get results. On the one hand she could be charming and kind, but she could switch quickly from friendship to hostility. She had years-long correspondences with her feminist friends, but could drop people when she considered them no longer useful for her career or ambitions.<ref>Kerstin Gullstrand Hermelin, Tyra Kleen and her background, in Tyra Kleen, her life and work rediscovered, Stockholm 2018</ref> Kleen was hardened by her childhood and refusing to give up her freedom for love.<ref>Niklas Franz\u00e9n, Tyra Kleen as a symbolist,s.72 in Tyra Kleen, etc. Stockholm 2018</ref><ref name=\":0\">Patrik Storn.

Art History, Uppsala University. no date.</ref>\n\nAs an adolescent, Kleen felt as though she was an outsider, not connected with her social surroundings. She filled this existential void not only with her professional ambitions but also with the theosophical-inspired world of oriental myths and rituals and tried to be part of it by dancing and drawing what she saw. Her cognitive, mental and emotional conceptions were inspired by [[feminism]], the \"[[New Woman]]\";  and by [[exotism]], especially the [[Theosophical mysticism]] of [[Annie Besant]], [[Jiddu Krishnamurti]] and [[Charles Webster Leadbeater]]. The latter founded the [[\"Orde van de Ster in het Oosten\"]] [https://nl.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orde_van_de_Ster_in_het_Oosten]  (a so-called mixed non-Masonic lodge), which became very popular in the Netherlands and  the Dutch East Indies.<ref>Messias verwachting in onze dagen, J.H. Bolt, Amersfoort, 1926</ref>\n\n===Europe===\nWhen she moved to Rome in 1898 because she was not accepted in Paris by the Theosophic movement, she joined a theosophical society in Rome and attended its meetings and lectures. She befriended persons like [[Anna Maria Roos]] and [[Mary and Jean Karadja Pascha]].\n\n[[File:Tyra-Kleen-1912.jpg|thumb|Tyra Kleen in 1912]]\nShe spent ten years in [[Rome]] as part of the contemporary cultural elite. She met Anders and Emma Zorn, Ellen Key, Carl Milles, Helena Nygren, Hjalmar S\u00f6derberg and Ottilia Adelborg; and later also went to live in [[Berlin]] and [[Paris]]. She traveled extensively, in 1910 to [[India]] and [[Sri Lanka|Ceylon]] and in 1919\u20131921 in [[Java]] and [[Bali]], where she studied dance, being inspired in Paris by the performances of [[Mata Hari]]. She exhibited her work in Berlin, [[Vienna]], [[Milan]], [[Rome]], Paris, [[London]] and [[Saint Petersburg|St. Petersburg]].<ref>Karin Str\u00f6m Lehander, Tyra Kleen- artist and woman at the fin de si\u00e8cle.  in: Tyra Kleen, Her life and work rediscovered.Stockholm 2018, s. 50-51.</ref> She visited the [[Caribbean]] and the [[United States]] and organized an exhibition in [[New York City|New York]] in 1917. Kleen was very well equipped in organising and networking using contacts and relatives in the world of diplomacy, freemasonry, theosophy, feminism and the local magistry. She excelled at becoming intimate with people who could be useful for her career.\n\n===Asia===\nIn 1919, after WWI, she traveled to Java and Bali on a Swedish cargo ship. In Solo ([[Surakarta]]), Kleen worked with [[Beata van Helsdingen-Schoevers]] to write an anthropological study on the ritual court dances of Solo. Both also participated in the dance lessons.[https://nl.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beata_van_Helsdingen-Schoevers] Kleen felt that dancing not only involved making the right movements on the sound of music, but that it also involved the transition into an altered state of mind to become in harmony not only with oneself, but with the Universe.\n\nUnfortunately, this project ended in July 1920 in turmoil due to clashing personalities, and van Helsdingen-Schoevers died 17 August 1920 of an unknown disease.<ref>Vivian van de Loo, \"Leven tussen Kunst en Krant, [[Beata van Helsdingen-Schoevers]],[[https://nl.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beata_van_Helsdingen-Schoevers]] journaliste en declamatrice in Indi\u00eb. KITLV Leiden 2004\". pp. 142\u2013149.</ref> The project was finished in 1925 with help from \"Volkslectuur\" (the commission of folk literature), [[Mabel Fowler]] and miss Gob\u00e9e, wife of the Head of the Office for Internal Affairs, titled \"The Serimpi and Bedojo Dances at the Court of Surakarta\", with 16 pages of text. In July 1925 there appeared a new edition with 30 pages of text. The coloured plates were reproductions made by the Topographic Service of Kleen's drawings. For everyone involved, but especially Kleen, the result was very disappointing, because she wanted to participate in this project in order to result in a standard reference work that could be presented worldwide.\n\nWhen she arrived in Bali in 1920, she started a new project on the mudras, or ritual hand poses, of the Balinese Hindu priests with the assistance of the Rajah of [[Kingdom of Karangasem|Karangasem]], Gusti Bagus Djilantik, whom she had met in Solo the year before, and of [[Piet de Kat Angelino]]. This was a turning point in her career because de Kat Angelino was able to explain to her the mudras and also encouraged the priests to cooperate. He was district-officer (controleur) of Gianjar and [[Klungklung]] for over a decade and had been collecting material on Balinese priests for years. At his home, she could draw priests and their mudras. Their work together is presented in the book ''Mudras'', with text and illustrations by Kleen, who acknowledged that much of the technical information about the poses and ceremonies came from de Kat Angelino and later on from R.Ng. Poerbatjaraka. Kleen spent the whole of 1921 in Java, working on the material collected in Bali the year before. She exhibited her pictures of the priests at the Art Society in Batavia. Collaboration with de Kat Angelino continued and she met him in Amsterdam on her way home. With his help an exhibition was arranged at the Colonial Institute in Amsterdam. The exhibition was favorably reviewed by de Kat Angelino in the magazine [[Nederlandsch Indi\u00eb, Oud en Nieuw |''Nederlandsch Indi\u00eb, Oud en Nieuw'']].\n\nAnother crucial exhibition was ''Tv\u00e5 vittberesta damer'' (Two Travelling Ladies) at [[Liljevalchs konsthall|Liljevalch's]] Public Art Gallery in Stockholm 1922, where she showed art and artifacts from [[Java]] and [[Bali]] together with Swedish photographer and author [[Ida Trotzig]] contributing works from [[Japan]]. This exhibition was the starting point for the \"Bali-fever\" in Sweden. Kleen's depictions of mudras were shown at the [[Victoria and Albert Museum]] in 1923.\n\nBesides ''Mudras'', Kleen published two other books about Bali: ''Ni-Si-Pleng, a story about black children written for white children'' (1924), and, seven years later, ''Tempeldanser och musikinstrument pa Bali'', printed in 300 numbered copies, translated in 1936 as ''The Temple Dances in Bali''.<ref>Elisabeth Lind: the pencil in the service of ethnographical research.p 91-133 in Tyra Kleen, her life and work rediscovered by Niclas Franz\u00e9n and others, Sweden 2018</ref>\n\nKleen's study on the mudras, the exhibition in Amsterdam at the Colonial Institute and the publication of her books made her internationally known. For her scientific ethnographic work on Bali, Kleen was awarded the Johan August Wahlberg silver medal in April 1938, given to individuals who have \"promoted anthropological and geographical science through outstanding efforts\".<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://ssag.se/om/stadgar-och-bestammelser/johan-august-wahlbergs-medaljfond/|title=SSAG {{!}} Svenska S\u00e4llskapet f\u00f6r Antropologi och Geografi {{!}} Johan August Wahlbergs medaljfond|website=ssag.se|language=sv-SE|access-date=2018-06-12}}</ref>\n\n[[Walter Spies]] was the central figure in the circle of artists residing on the island in Ubud, Klungklung and Karangasem. He was considered to be the greatest expert on Balinese dance and drama. Together with the British dance critic [[Beryl de Zoete]], he wrote the standard 1938 work ''Dance and Drama in Bali''. Spies was jealous of the international success of Kleen{{Citation needed|date=March 2020}} and wrote a very critical nine-page review of the ''Temple Dances in Bali'' in the journal ''Djawa'' (1939). He complained, \"the text and the depictions are filled with so many mistakes, errors and incorrect statements that one must shake one's head.\" Spies claims that as an ethnographic document the book has no value.<ref>Elisabeth Lind, The pencil in the service of ethnographical research, etc. p. 131-132,</ref> As a result, there were nearly no references to the work of Kleen in any ethnographic periodicals or publications after this critical review. It is only in 1962 that [[C. Hooykaas]] in his article \"Saiva-Siddhanta in Java and Bali\"<ref>Bijdragen tot de Taal-, Land- en Volkenkunde 118 (1962) no 3(Leiden 309-327</ref> supported the importance of the study on mudras by de Kat Angelino and Kleen.\n\nKleen contributed work to various European magazines, including ''Sluyters' Monthly'', ''Nederlandsch Indi\u00eb Oud en Nieuw'', ''Ord och Bild'' and ''Inter-Ocean'', between 1920 and 1925<ref>Haks & Maris, Lexicon of foreign artists who visualized Indonesia. (1600-1950),Singapore 1995</ref> and influenced in this way the perception and expectations of foreign visitors to Bali. Furthermore, she influenced with her colourful, vivid and dynamic art-deco drawing style the development of painting by local artists in Bali, not in a one-way influence but more a kind of mutual influence.<ref>Bruce Granquist. Inventing art: The paintings of Batuan Bali. Satumata Press, 2012</ref> Mostly these local paintings were made for the touristic market and depicted daily life instead of exclusively being concerned with gods, demons and the [[Ramayana]] and [[Mahabharata]] epics. In this way, she took part in the marketing of \"the last paradise\". This also meant that she became associated with this type of magazine drawing instead of her more important  ethnographic publications.\n\n===Egypt===\nIn 1926, Kleen visited Egypt to study the meanings of the different hand and foot movements depicted in the art, which resulted in her last publication in 1946 of the book ''Solens Son'' about pharaoh [[Akhenaten|Echnaton]].\n\n===Legacy===\n[[File:Tyra-Kleen.jpg|thumb|Tyra Kleen in the 1940s]]\nKleen left her collections to the Swedish House of Nobility on the condition that the archive would not be opened until 50 years after her death.[https://www.riddarhuset.se/tyra-kleens-samling] In 2001, the paintings, lithographs, drawings, diaries and sketches were brought out and the private part of her collection was brought home to Valinge.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.riddarhuset.se/tyra-kleens-samling/|title=Tyra Kleens samling : Riddarhuset|website=www.riddarhuset.se|language=sv-SE|access-date=2018-06-12}}</ref> Kleen is represented with art at, for instance, [[Gothenburg Museum of Art]]<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://emp-web-34.zetcom.ch/eMuseumPlus?service=ExternalInterface&module=collection&objectId=24094&viewType=detailView|title=G\u00f6teborgs konstmuseum {{!}} Orientalisk parfym|website=emp-web-34.zetcom.ch|language=sv|access-date=2018-06-12}}</ref> and [[Nationalmuseum]]<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://emp-web-84.zetcom.ch/eMP/eMuseumPlus?service=ExternalInterface&module=artist&objectId=15325&viewType=detailView|title=Nationalmuseum - Tyra Kleen|website=emp-web-84.zetcom.ch|language=en|access-date=2018-06-12}}</ref> in Stockholm.

She loved her freedom and hated to be dominated by men or women. She was very ambitious and particular in traveling and doing business. She was very productive and could work for hours, days and weeks to get results. On the one hand she could be charming and kind, but she could switch quickly from friendship to hostility.
