Reaching an altitude of {{convert|5700|m|ft|abbr=on}} just {{convert|42|km|mi|abbr=on}} from the Caribbean coast, the Sierra Nevada is one of the world's highest coastal ranges, being 250m shorter than the [[Saint Elias Mountains]] in Canada. The Sierra Nevada encompasses about {{convert|17000|km2|sqmi|abbr=on}} and serves as the source of 36 rivers. The range is in the Departments of [[Magdalena Department|Magdalena]], [[Cesar Department|Cesar]] and [[La Guajira Department|La Guajira]].\n\nThe highest point of the Sierra Nevada group (and Colombia in general) may be either [[Pico Crist\u00f3bal Col\u00f3n]] or Pico Sim\u00f3n Bol\u00edvar both in the municipalities of Santa Marta and [[Aracataca]]; it has yet to be determined which is higher. [[SRTM]] data and local topographic maps show that their true elevations are approximately {{convert|5700|m|ft|abbr=on}}, lower than the {{convert|5775|m|ft|abbr=on}} elevation that is often quoted.\n\nThe Sierra Nevada is a compact group, relatively small in area, and completely surrounded by lands with elevations below {{convert|200|m|ft|abbr=on}}. Although it is associated with the [[Tropical Andes]],{{cn}} the main backbone of the Andes cannot be reached from the Sierra Nevada without dropping below this level. This makes its highest point the world's fifth most [[topographic prominence|prominent]] summit.\n\nSeveral peaks in the Sierra Nevada are intervisible with [[Paramillo Massif|Cerro Paramillo]], a {{convert|3730|m|ft|abbr=on}} peak <ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.peakbagger.com/peak.aspx?pid=8351|title=Cerro Paramillo - Peakbagger.com|author=|date=|website=www.peakbagger.com|accessdate=8 April 2018}}</ref> in [[Antioquia Department]].

The [[Sin\u00fa Valley dry forests]] cover the range's lower slopes, up to an elevation of {{convert|500|m|ft|abbr=on}}.\n\nThe [[Santa Marta montane forests]] lie above {{convert|500|m|ft|abbr=on}} to {{convert|800|m|ft|abbr=on}}. The montane forests are separated from other moist forests by the lower-elevation dry forests and xeric shrublands, and have large numbers of [[endemic (ecology)|endemic]] species. The montane forest ecoregion has several distinct plant communities, distinguished by altitude and rainfall; moist lowland forests cover the windward northern and western flanks of the range between {{convert|500|m|ft|abbr=on}} and {{convert|900|m|ft|abbr=on}}, and the drier eastern and southern flanks from {{convert|5800|m|ft|abbr=on}} to {{convert|1000|m|ft|abbr=on}}. Above {{convert|900|m|ft|abbr=on}} is a transitional forest zone of smaller trees and palms. [[Cloud forest]]s occur above {{convert|1000|m|ft|abbr=on}}; the Sub-Andean forests from {{convert|1000|m|ft|abbr=on}} to {{convert|2500|m|ft|abbr=on}} form a canopy {{convert|25|m|ft|abbr=on}} to {{convert|35|m|ft|abbr=on}} tall, while the higher-elevation Andean forests, between {{convert|2500|m|ft|abbr=on}} and {{convert|3300|m|ft|abbr=on}}, grow to {{convert|15|m|ft|abbr=on}} to {{convert|20|m|ft|abbr=on}} in height.\n\nThe [[Santa Marta P\u00e1ramo]], a high altitude belt of [[montane grasslands and shrublands]] interspersed with marshes and acid bogs, occupies the zone between {{convert|3300|m|ft|abbr=on}} and {{convert|5000|m|ft|abbr=on}}. The Santa Marta P\u00e1ramo is the northernmost enclave of [[P\u00e1ramo]] in South America, which occur along the Andes belt. Above {{convert|5000|m|ft|abbr=on}} meters lies the permanent snow cap.\n\n==National Natural Park==\n\nThe '''Sierra Nevada de Santa Marta National Natural Park''' ({{lang-es|Parque Nacional Natural Sierra Nevada de Santa Marta}}) is [[Colombia]]'s second oldest [[national park]], established in 1964.<ref name=\"IUCN127\">{{harvnb|IUCN|1982|p=127}}</ref> It is located in the [[Cordillera Oriental (Colombia)|Cordillera Oriental range]], between the departments of [[La Guajira Department|La Guajira]], [[Magdalena Department|Magdalena]] and [[Cesar Department|Cesar]], in the mountain range of the Sierra Nevada de Santa Marta. It is a sanctuary as well as a tourist attraction, because it offers different climate, terrain, flora and fauna environments, ranging from [[beach]]es to snowy mountain peaks. Sierra Nevada de Santa Marta National Natural Park is considered a unique place in the world due to its isolation from the Andes and its highest peak (5700 meters above sea level) is located just 42&nbsp;km away from the sea.\n\n<!-- It belongs geographically to the [[Amazon Basin]], but it is [[Hydrography|hydrographically]] a part of the [[Orinoco|Orinoco River]] basin. <ref name=\"Villegas381\"/> -->All the water courses that originate in the national park drain to the Caribbean sea whether directly (e. g. rivers Rancher\u00eda, Don Diego, Palomino, Buritaca, Guachaca, Ca\u00f1as, etc.) or through the [[Magdalena River]] system that includes the [[Ci\u00e9naga Grande de Santa Marta]], (e. g., rivers [[Cesar River|Cesar]], Ariguan\u00ed, Fundaci\u00f3n, Fr\u00edo, Aracataca, etc.).

The Quaternary of the Sierra Nevada de Santa Marta is mainly represented by colluvial-alluvial valley fill and by recent beach deposits. The coastlines of the northwestern part of the Sierra Nevada de Santa Marta are indented, reflecting the alternation of rocky headlands and deep, NNW trending tectonically controlled bays. The headlands are typically {{convert|100|to|150|m|ft|abbr=on}} high plunging cliffs cut into schists and granites, whereas the embayments front alluvial valley deposits.

Reaching an altitude of {{convert|5700|m|ft|abbr=on}} just {{convert|42|km|mi|abbr=on}} from the Caribbean coast, the Sierra Nevada is one of the world's highest coastal ranges, being 250m shorter than the [[Saint Elias Mountains]] in Canada. The Sierra Nevada encompasses about {{convert|17000|km2|sqmi|abbr=on}} and serves as the source of 36 rivers. The range is in the Departments of [[Magdalena Department|Magdalena]], [[Cesar Department|Cesar]] and [[La Guajira Department|La Guajira]].\n\nThe highest point of the Sierra Nevada group (and Colombia in general) may be either [[Pico Crist\u00f3bal Col\u00f3n]] or Pico Sim\u00f3n Bol\u00edvar both in the municipalities of Santa Marta and [[Aracataca]]; it has yet to be determined which is higher. [[SRTM]] data and local topographic maps show that their true elevations are approximately {{convert|5700|m|ft|abbr=on}}, lower than the {{convert|5775|m|ft|abbr=on}} elevation that is often quoted.\n\nThe Sierra Nevada is a compact group, relatively small in area, and completely surrounded by lands with elevations below {{convert|200|m|ft|abbr=on}}. Although it is associated with the [[Tropical Andes]],{{citerequired}} the main backbone of the Andes cannot be reached from the Sierra Nevada without dropping below this level.

They feed by means of suction and cutting of their prey. They have large mouths that can essentially inhale prey and their teeth cut up any pieces that are too large to swallow. They show a characteristic rolling motion of the head when feeding. Only in [[Alaska]] has the shark's diet been studied - most sharks' stomachs contain remains of [[giant Pacific octopus]]. They are also known to feed on bottom-dwelling [[teleost]] fishes, as well as [[Sole (fish)|soles]], [[flounder]]s, [[Alaska pollock]], [[Sebastes|rockfishes]], [[shrimp]]s, [[hermit crab]]s, and even marine [[snail]]s. Larger Pacific sleeper sharks are also found to feed on fast-swimming prey such as [[squid]]s, [[Pacific salmon]], and [[harbor porpoise]]s. The diet of the Pacific sleeper shark seems to broaden as they increase in size. For example, a 3.7-m female shark found off [[Trinidad, California]] was found to have fed mostly on [[giant squid]]. Sleeper sharks found in Alaskan waters from {{convert|2|to|3|m|ft|abbr=on}} seem to feed mostly on flounder, pollock, and [[cephalopoda|cephalopods]], while sleeper sharks {{convert|3.3|to|4.25|m|ft|abbr=on}} long seem to consume teleosts and cephalopods, as well as [[marine mammal]]s. A recent study in the Gulf of Alaska suggests that sleeper sharks may prey on juvenile Steller sea lions.<ref>{{cite journal|author=Markus Horning|author2=Jo-Ann Mellish|last-author-amp=yes|title=In cold blood: evidence of Pacific sleeper shark (''Somniosus pacificus'') predation on Steller sea lions (''Eumetopias jubatus'') in the Gulf of Alaska|doi=10.7755/FB.112.4.6|year=2014|journal=Fishery Bulletin|volume=112|issue=4|pages=297\u2013310|url=http://ir.library.oregonstate.edu/xmlui/bitstream/1957/54605/1/HorningMarkusFisheriesWildlifeInColdBlood.pdf}}</ref>\n\n==Reproduction==\nVery little is known about the early life of Pacific sleeper sharks. They are believed to produce eggs that hatch inside the female's body (reproduction is [[ovoviviparity|ovoviviparous]]), but gestation time is unknown and litter sizes are thought to be about 10 pups.

They feed by means of suction and cutting of their prey. They have large mouths that can essentially inhale prey and their teeth cut up any pieces that are too large to swallow. They show a characteristic rolling motion of the head when feeding. Only in [[Alaska]] has the shark's diet been studied - most sharks' stomachs contain remains of [[giant Pacific octopus]]. They are also known to feed on bottom-dwelling [[teleost]] fishes, as well as [[Sole (fish)|soles]], [[flounder]]s, [[Alaska pollock]], [[Sebastes|rockfishes]], [[shrimp]]s, [[hermit crab]]s, and even marine [[snail]]s. Larger Pacific sleeper sharks are also found to feed on fast-swimming prey such as [[squid]]s, [[Pacific salmon]], and [[harbor porpoise]]s. The diet of the Pacific sleeper shark seems to broaden as they increase in size. For example, a 3.7-m female shark found off [[Trinidad, California]] was found to have fed mostly on [[giant squid]]. Sleeper sharks found in Alaskan waters from {{convert|2|to|3|m|ft|abbr=on}} seem to feed mostly on flounder, pollock, and [[cephalopoda|cephalopods]], while sleeper sharks {{convert|3.3|to|4.25|m|ft|abbr=on}} long seem to consume teleosts and cephalopods, as well as [[marine mammal]]s. A recent study in the Gulf of Alaska suggests that sleeper sharks may prey on juvenile Steller sea lions.<ref>{{cite journal|author=Markus Horning|author2=Jo-Ann Mellish|last-author-amp=yes|title=In cold blood: evidence of Pacific sleeper shark (''Somniosus pacificus'') predation on Steller sea lions (''Eumetopias jubatus'') in the Gulf of Alaska|doi=10.7755/FB.112.4.6|year=2014|journal=Fishery Bulletin|volume=112|issue=4|pages=297\u2013310|url=http://ir.library.oregonstate.edu/xmlui/bitstream/1957/54605/1/HorningMarkusFisheriesWildlifeInColdBlood.pdf}}</ref>\n\n==Reproduction==\nVery little is known about the early life of Pacific sleeper sharks.

He holds a joint appointment as [[Institute Professor]] Emeritus at the [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]] (MIT) and [[Laureate]] Professor at the [[University of Arizona]], and is the author of more than 100 books on topics such as [[linguistics]], war, politics, and [[mass media]]. Ideologically, he aligns with [[anarcho-syndicalism]] and [[libertarian socialism]].\n\n<!--Early life up until 1966-->\nBorn to [[Ashkenazi]] [[Jews|Jewish]] immigrants in [[Philadelphia]], Chomsky developed an early interest in [[anarchism]] from alternative bookstores in [[New York City]]. He studied at the [[University of Pennsylvania]]. During his [[postgraduate]] work in the [[Harvard Society of Fellows]], Chomsky developed the theory of [[transformational grammar]] for which he earned his doctorate in 1955. That year he began teaching at MIT, and in 1957 emerged as a significant figure in linguistics with his landmark work ''[[Syntactic Structures]]'', which played a major role in remodeling the study of language. From 1958 to 1959 Chomsky was a [[National Science Foundation]] fellow at the [[Institute for Advanced Study]]. He created or co-created the [[Universal Grammar|universal grammar]] theory, the [[generative grammar]] theory, the [[Chomsky hierarchy]], and the [[minimalist program]]. Chomsky also played a pivotal role in the decline of linguistic [[behaviorism]], and was particularly critical of the work of [[B. F. Skinner]].\n\n<!--Later life post-1967-->\nAn outspoken [[Opposition to United States involvement in the Vietnam War|opponent]] of [[Role of the United States in the Vietnam War|U.S. involvement in the Vietnam War]], which he saw as an act of [[American imperialism]], in 1967 Chomsky rose to national attention for his antiwar essay \"[[The Responsibility of Intellectuals]]\". Associated with the [[New Left]], he was arrested multiple times for his activism and placed on President [[Richard Nixon]]'s [[Nixon's Enemies List|Enemies List]]. While expanding his work in linguistics over subsequent decades, he also became involved in the [[linguistics wars]]. In collaboration with [[Edward S. Herman]], Chomsky later articulated the [[propaganda model]] of [[media criticism]] in ''[[Manufacturing Consent]]'' and worked to expose the [[Indonesian occupation of East Timor]]. His defense of [[freedom of speech]], including [[Holocaust denial]], generated significant controversy in the [[Faurisson affair]] of the 1980s. Since retiring from MIT, he has continued his vocal political activism, including opposing the [[2003 invasion of Iraq]] and supporting the [[Occupy movement]]. Chomsky began teaching at the University of Arizona in 2017.\n\n<!--Brief assessment of Chomsky's reception and legacy:-->\nOne of the most cited scholars alive,{{sfn|''MIT Tech Talk''|1992}} Chomsky has influenced a broad array of academic fields. He is widely recognized as having helped to spark the [[cognitive revolution]] in the [[human sciences]], contributing to the development of a new [[Cognitivism (psychology)|cognitivistic]] framework for the study of [[language]] and the [[mind]]. In addition to his continued scholarship, he remains a leading [[Criticism of United States foreign policy|critic]] of [[U.S. foreign policy]], [[neoliberalism]] and contemporary [[state capitalism]], the [[Israeli\u2013Palestinian conflict]], and mainstream [[news media]]. His ideas have proven highly influential in the [[anti-capitalist]] and [[anti-imperialist]] movements, but have also drawn criticism, with some accusing Chomsky of [[anti-Americanism]].\n\n== Life ==\n===Childhood: 1928\u20131945===\nAvram Noam Chomsky was born on December 7, 1928, in the [[East Oak Lane, Philadelphia|East Oak Lane]] neighborhood of [[Philadelphia]], [[Pennsylvania]].{{sfnm|1a1=Lyons|1y=1978|1p=xv|2a1=Barsky|2y=1997|2p=9|3a1=McGilvray|3y=2014|3p=3}} His parents, [[Ze'ev \"William\" Chomsky]] and Elsie Simonofsky, were Jewish immigrants.{{sfnm|1a1=Barsky|1y=1997|1pp=9\u201310|2a1=Sperlich|2y=2006|2p=11}} William had fled the [[Russian Empire]] in 1913 to escape conscription and worked in [[Baltimore]] [[sweatshop]]s and Hebrew elementary schools before attending university.{{sfn|Barsky|1997|p=9}} After moving to Philadelphia, William became principal of the [[Congregation Mikveh Israel]] religious school and joined the [[Gratz College]] faculty.

He bases his argument on observations about human [[language acquisition]] and describes a \"[[poverty of the stimulus]]\": an enormous gap between the linguistic stimuli to which children are exposed and the rich [[linguistic competence]] they attain. For example, although children are exposed to only a very small and finite subset of the allowable [[Sentence (linguistics)|syntactic variants]] within their first language, they somehow acquire the highly organized and systematic ability to understand and produce [[Digital infinity|an infinite number of sentences]], including ones that have never before been uttered, in that language.{{sfn|Dovey|2015}} To explain this, Chomsky reasoned that the primary linguistic data must be supplemented by an [[innate linguistic capacity]]. Furthermore, while a human baby and a kitten are both capable of [[inductive reasoning]], if they are exposed to exactly the same linguistic data, the human will always acquire the ability to understand and produce language, while the kitten will never acquire either ability. Chomsky labeled whatever relevant capacity the human has that the cat lacks the [[language acquisition device]], and suggested that one of linguists' tasks should be to determine what that device is and what constraints it imposes on the range of possible human languages.

basic principle of the [[foreign policy of the United States]] is the establishment of \"open societies\" that are economically and politically controlled by the United States and where U.S.-based businesses can prosper.{{sfn|Sperlich|2006|p=92}} He argues that the U.S. seeks to suppress any movements within these countries that are not compliant with U.S. interests and to ensure that U.S.-friendly governments are placed in power.{{sfn|McGilvray|2014|p=159}} When discussing current events, he emphasizes their place within a wider historical perspective.{{sfn|McGilvray|2014|p=160}} He believes that official, sanctioned historical accounts of U.S. and British extraterritorial operations have consistently whitewashed these nations' actions in order to present them as having benevolent motives in either spreading democracy or, in older instances, spreading [[Christianity]]; criticizing these accounts, he seeks to correct them.{{sfn|McGilvray|2014|p=13}} Prominent examples he regularly cites are the actions of the British Empire in India and Africa and the actions of the U.S. in Vietnam, the Philippines, Latin America, and the Middle East.{{sfn|McGilvray|2014|p=13}}\n\nChomsky's political work has centered heavily on criticizing the actions of the United States.{{sfn|McGilvray|2014|p=160}} He has said he focuses on the U.S. because the country has militarily and economically dominated the world during his lifetime and because its [[liberal democracy|liberal democratic]] electoral system allows the citizenry to influence government policy.{{sfn|McGilvray|2014|pp=14, 160}} His hope is that, by spreading awareness of the impact U.S. foreign policies have on the populations affected by them, he can sway the populations of the U.S. and other countries into opposing the policies.{{sfn|McGilvray|2014|p=13}} He urges people to criticize their governments' motivations, decisions, and actions, to accept responsibility for their own thoughts and actions, and to apply the same standards to others as to themselves.{{sfn|McGilvray|2014|p=18}}\n\nChomsky has been critical of U.S. involvement in the [[Israeli\u2013Palestinian conflict]], arguing that it has consistently blocked a peaceful settlement.{{sfn|McGilvray|2014|p=159}} Chomsky also criticizes the U.S.'s close ties with Saudi Arabia and

developed a disdain for [[authoritarian socialism]], as represented by the Marxist\u2013Leninist policies of the Soviet Union.{{sfnm|1a1=Barsky|1y=1997|1p=168|2a1=Sperlich|2y=2006|2p=16}} Rather than accepting the common view among U.S. economists that a spectrum exists between total state ownership of the economy and total private ownership, he instead suggests that a spectrum should be understood between total democratic control of the economy and total autocratic control (whether state or private).{{sfn|McGilvray|2014|pp=164\u2013165}} He argues that Western capitalist countries are not really democratic,{{sfn|McGilvray|2014|p=169}} because, in his view, a truly democratic society is one in which all persons have a say in public economic policy.{{sfn|McGilvray|2014|p=170}} He has stated his opposition to [[ruling elites]], among them institutions like the [[IMF]], [[World Bank]], and [[GATT]] (precursor to the [[WTO]]).{{sfn|Barsky|1997|p=211}}\n\nChomsky highlights that, since the 1970s, [[Wealth inequality in the United States|the U.S. has become increasingly economically unequal]] as a result of the repeal of various financial regulations and the rescinding of the [[Bretton Woods financial control agreement]].{{sfn|McGilvray|2014|p=14}} He characterizes the U.S. as a ''de facto'' [[one-party state]], viewing both the [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican Party]] and [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]] as manifestations of a single \"Business Party\" controlled by corporate and financial interests.{{sfn|McGilvray|2014|pp=14\u201315}} Chomsky highlights that, within Western capitalist liberal democracies, at least 80% of the population has no control over economic decisions, which are instead in the hands of a management class and ultimately controlled by a small, wealthy elite.{{sfn|McGilvray|2014|p=15}}\n\nNoting the entrenchment of such an economic system, Chomsky believes that change is possible through the organized cooperation of large numbers of people who understand the problem and know how they want to reorganize the economy more equitably.{{sfn|McGilvray|2014|p=15}} Acknowledging that corporate domination of media and government stifles any significant change to this system, he sees reason for optimism in historical examples such as the social rejection of slavery as immoral, the advances in women's rights, and the forcing of government to justify invasions.{{sfn|McGilvray|2014|p=14}} He views violent revolution to overthrow a government as a last resort to be avoided if possible, citing the example of historical revolutions where the population's welfare has worsened as a result of upheaval.{{sfn|McGilvray|2014|p=15}}\n\nChomsky sees libertarian socialist and anarcho-syndicalist ideas as the descendants of the [[classical liberal]] ideas of the [[Age of Enlightenment]],{{sfnm|1a1=Sperlich|1y=2006|1p=89|2a1=McGilvray|2y=2014|2p=189}} arguing that his ideological position revolves around \"nourishing the libertarian and creative character of the human being\".{{sfn|Barsky|1997|p=95}} He envisions an anarcho-syndicalist future with direct worker control of the [[means of production]] and government by [[workers' council]]s, who would select representatives to meet together at general assemblies.{{sfn|McGilvray|2014|p=199}} The point of this self-governance is to make each citizen, in [[Thomas Jefferson]]'s words, \"a direct participator in the government of affairs.\"{{sfn|McGilvray|2014|p=210}} He believes that there will be no need for [[political parties]].{{sfn|McGilvray|2014|p=200}} By controlling their productive life, he believes that individuals can gain job satisfaction and a sense of fulfillment and purpose.{{sfn|McGilvray|2014|pp=197, 202}} He argues that unpleasant and unpopular jobs could be fully automated,

Chomsky asserts that this version of censorship, by government-guided \"free market\" forces, is subtler and harder to undermine than was the equivalent propaganda system in the Soviet Union.{{sfn|Rai|1995|pp=37\u201338}} As he argues, the mainstream press is corporate-owned and thus reflects corporate priorities and interests.{{sfn|McGilvray|2014|p=179}} Acknowledging that many American journalists are dedicated and well-meaning, he argues that the mass media's choices of topics and issues, the unquestioned premises on which that coverage rests, and the range of opinions expressed are all constrained to reinforce the state's ideology:{{sfn|McGilvray|2014|p=178}} although mass media will criticize individual politicians and political parties, it will not undermine the wider state-corporate nexus of which it is a part.{{sfn|McGilvray|2014|p=189}} As evidence, he highlights that the U.S. mass media does not employ any socialist journalists or political commentators.{{sfn|McGilvray|2014|p=177}} He also points to examples of important news stories that the U.S. mainstream media has ignored because reporting on them would reflect badly upon the country, including the murder of [[Black Panther Party|Black Panther]] [[Fred Hampton]] with possible [[FBI]] involvement, the massacres in Nicaragua perpetrated by U.S.-funded [[Contras]], and the constant reporting on Israeli deaths without equivalent coverage of the far larger number of Palestinian deaths in that conflict.{{sfn|McGilvray|2014|pp=179\u2013182}} To remedy this situation, Chomsky calls for grassroots democratic control and involvement of the media.{{sfn|McGilvray|2014|p=184}}\n\nChomsky considers most [[conspiracy theories]] fruitless, distracting substitutes for thinking about policy formation in an institutional framework, where individual manipulation is secondary to broader social imperatives.{{sfn|Rai|1995|p=70}} While not dismissing them outright, he considers them unproductive to challenging power in a substantial way. In response to the labeling of his own ideas as a conspiracy theory, Chomsky has said that it is very rational for the media to manipulate information in order to sell it, like any other business. He asks whether [[General Motors]] would be accused of conspiracy if it deliberately selected what it used or discarded to sell its product.{{sfn|Rai|1995|p=42}}\n\n== Other disciplines ==\nChomsky has also been active in a number of [[Philosophy|philosophical]] fields, including [[philosophy of mind]], [[philosophy of language]], and [[philosophy of science]].{{sfn|McGilvray|2014|p=19}} In these fields he is credited with ushering in the \"[[cognitive revolution]]\",{{sfn|McGilvray|2014|p=19}} a significant [[paradigm shift]] that rejected [[logical positivism]], the prevailing philosophical methodology of the time, and reframed how philosophers think about [[language]] and the [[mind]].{{sfn|Szab\u00f3|2010}} Chomsky views the cognitive revolution as rooted in 17th-century [[Rationalism|rationalist]] ideals.{{sfn|Friesen|2017|p=46}} His position\u2014the idea that the mind contains inherent structures to understand language, perception, and thought\u2014has more in common with rationalism (Enlightenment and Cartesian) than behaviorism.{{sfn|Greif|2015|p=313}} He named one of his key works [[Cartesian linguistics|''Cartesian Linguistics: A Chapter in the History of Rationalist Thought'']] (1966).{{sfn|Friesen|2017|p=46}} In philosophy of language, Chomsky is particularly known for his criticisms of the notion of reference and meaning in human language and his perspective on the nature and function of mental representations.{{sfn|Cipriani|2016|pp=44\u201360}}\n\nChomsky's famous [[Chomsky\u2013Foucault debate|1971 debate]] on [[human nature]] with the French philosopher [[Michel Foucault]] was symbolic in positioning Chomsky as the prototypical [[analytic philosopher]] against Foucault, a stalwart of the [[continental philosopher|continental]] tradition.{{sfn|Greif|2015|pp=312\u2013313}} It showed what appeared to be irreconcilable differences between two moral and intellectual luminaries of the 20th century. Foucault's position was that of critique, that human nature could not be conceived in terms foreign to present understanding, while Chomsky held that human nature contained universalities such as a common standard of moral justice as deduced through reason based on what rationally serves human necessity.{{sfn|Greif|2015|p=315}} Chomsky criticized [[postmodernism]] and [[French philosophy]] generally, arguing that the obscure language of postmodern, leftist philosophers gives little aid to the working classes.{{sfnm|1a1=Barsky|1y=1997|1pp=192\u2013195|2a1=Sperlich|2y=2006|2p=53}} He has also debated analytic philosophers, including [[Tyler Burge]], [[Donald Davidson (philosopher)|Donald Davidson]], [[Michael Dummett]], [[Saul Kripke]], [[Thomas Nagel]], [[Hilary Putnam]], [[Willard Van Orman Quine]], and [[John Searle]].{{sfn|Szab\u00f3|2010}}\n\nChomsky's contributions span [[intellectual history|intellectual]] and world history, including history of philosophy.{{sfn|Otero|2003|p=416}} Irony is a recurring characteristic of his writing, as he often implies that his readers know better, which can make them more engaged in the veracity of his claims.{{sfn|McGilvray|2014|p=162}}\n\n==Personal life==\n[[File:Chomsky and others.jpg|thumb|left|Chomsky ''(far right)'' and his wife Valeria ''(second from right)'' with David and Carolee Krieger of the [[Nuclear Age Peace Foundation]], 2014]]\n\nChomsky endeavors to keep his family life, linguistic scholarship, and political activism strictly separate from one another,{{sfnm|1a1=Barsky|1y=1997|1p=158|2a1=Sperlich|2y=2006|2p=19}} calling himself \"scrupulous at keeping my politics out of the classroom\".{{sfn|Barsky|1997|p=121}} An intensely private person,{{sfn|Sperlich|2006|p=7}} he is uninterested in appearances and the fame his work has brought him.{{sfn|Barsky|1997|p=116}} He also has little interest in modern art and music.{{sfn|Barsky|1997|pp=206\u2013207}} McGilvray suggests that Chomsky was never motivated by a desire for fame, but impelled to tell what he perceived as the truth and a desire to aid others in doing so.{{sfn|McGilvray|2014|p=230}} Chomsky acknowledges that his income affords him a privileged life compared to the majority of the world's population;{{sfn|Sperlich|2006|p=9}} nevertheless, he characterizes himself as a \"worker\", albeit one who uses his intellect as his employable skill.{{sfn|McGilvray|2014|p=6}} He reads four or five newspapers daily; in the US, he subscribes to ''[[The Boston Globe]]'', ''[[The New York Times]]'', ''[[The Wall Street Journal]]'', ''[[Financial Times]]'', and ''[[The Christian Science Monitor]]''.{{sfn|Sperlich|2006|p=121}} Chomsky is [[non-religious]], but has expressed approval of forms of religion such as [[liberation theology]].{{sfn|Sperlich|2006|p=69}}\n\nChomsky has attracted controversy for calling established political and academic figures \"corrupt\", \"fascist\", and \"fraudulent\".{{sfn|Barsky|1997|p=199}} His colleague [[Steven Pinker]] has said that he \"portrays people who disagree with him as stupid or evil, using withering scorn in his rhetoric\", and that this contributes to the extreme reactions he receives from critics.{{sfn|Jaggi|2001}} Chomsky avoids attending [[academic conferences]], including left-oriented ones such as the Socialist Scholars Conference, preferring to speak to activist groups or hold university seminars for mass audiences.{{sfn|Barsky|1997|p=169}} His approach to academic freedom has led him to support MIT academics whose actions he deplores; in 1969, when Chomsky heard that [[Walt Rostow]], a major architect of the Vietnam war, wanted to return to work at MIT, Chomsky threatened \"to protest publicly\" if Rostow was denied a position at MIT. In 1989, when Pentagon adviser [[John Deutch]] applied to be president of MIT, Chomsky supported his candidacy.

To a lot of people in the margins\u2014activists and movements\u2014he's unfailingly supportive.\"{{sfn|Jaggi|2001}} [[Arundhati Roy]] has called him \"one of the greatest, most radical public thinkers of our time\",{{sfn|Sperlich|2006|p=114}} and [[Edward Said]] thought him \"one of the most significant challengers of unjust power and delusions\".{{sfn|Jaggi|2001}} [[Fred Halliday]] has said that by the start of the 21st century Chomsky had become a \"guru\" for the world's anti-capitalist and anti-imperialist movements.{{sfn|Jaggi|2001}} The propaganda model of media criticism that he and Herman developed has been widely accepted in radical media critiques and adopted to some level in mainstream criticism of the media,{{sfn|Sperlich|2006|p=129}} also exerting a significant influence on the growth of [[alternative media]], including radio, publishers, and the Internet, which in turn have helped to disseminate his work.{{sfn|Sperlich|2006|p=142}}\n\nSperlich also notes that Chomsky has been vilified by corporate interests, particularly in the mainstream press.{{sfn|Sperlich|2006|p=10}} University departments devoted to history and political science rarely include Chomsky's work on their undergraduate syllabi.{{sfn|Barsky|1997|pp=153\u2013154}} Critics have argued that despite publishing widely on social and political issues, Chomsky has no formal expertise in these areas; he has responded that such issues are not as complex as many [[social science|social scientists]] claim and that almost everyone is able to comprehend them regardless of whether they have been academically trained to do so.{{sfn|McGilvray|2014|p=161}} According to McGilvray, many of Chomsky's critics \"do not bother quoting his work or quote out of context, distort, and create straw men that cannot be supported by Chomsky's text\".{{sfn|McGilvray|2014|p=161}}\n\nChomsky drew criticism for not calling the [[Srebrenica massacre]] during the [[Bosnian War]] a \"genocide\", which he said would devalue the word,{{sfn|Braun|2018}} and in appearing to deny [[Ed Vulliamy]]'s reporting on the existence of Bosnian concentration camps. The subsequent editorial correction of his comments, viewed as a capitulation, was criticized by multiple Balkan watchers.{{sfn|Nettelfield|2010|p=142}}\n\nChomsky's far-reaching criticisms of U.S. foreign policy and the legitimacy of U.S. power have raised controversy. A document obtained pursuant to a [[Freedom of Information Act (United States)|Freedom of Information Act]] (FOIA) request from the U.S. government revealed that the [[Central Intelligence Agency]] (CIA) monitored his activities and for years denied doing so. The CIA also destroyed its files on Chomsky at some point, possibly in violation of federal law.{{sfn|Hudson|2013}} He has often received undercover police protection at MIT and when speaking on the Middle East, but has refused uniformed police protection.{{sfn|Rabbani|2012}} German newspaper ''[[Der Spiegel]]'' described Chomsky as \"the Ayatollah of anti-American hatred\",{{sfn|Sperlich|2006|p=10}} while [[American conservatism|conservative]] commentator [[David Horowitz]] called him \"the most devious, the most dishonest and&nbsp;... the most treacherous intellect in America\", whose work is infused with \"anti-American dementia\" and evidences his \"pathological hatred of his own country\".{{sfn|Horowitz|2001}} Writing in ''[[Commentary (magazine)|Commentary]]'' magazine, the journalist [[Jonathan Kay]] described Chomsky as \"a hard-boiled anti-American monomaniac who simply refuses to believe anything that any American leader says\".{{sfn|Kay|2011}}\n\nChomsky's criticism of Israel has led to his being called a traitor to the Jewish people and an [[anti-Semitism|anti-Semite]].{{sfn|Sperlich|2006|p=100}} Criticizing Chomsky's defense of the right of individuals to engage in Holocaust denial on the grounds that freedom of speech must be extended to all viewpoints, [[Werner Cohn]] called Chomsky \"the most important patron\" of the [[Neo-Nazism|neo-Nazi]] movement.{{sfn|Cohn|1995|p=37}} The [[Anti-Defamation League]] (ADL), called him a Holocaust denier,{{sfn|Sperlich|2006|p=101}} describing him as a \"dupe of intellectual pride so overweening that he is incapable of making distinctions between totalitarian and democratic societies, between oppressors and victims\".{{sfn|Sperlich|2006|p=101}} In turn, Chomsky has claimed that the ADL is dominated by \"Stalinist types\" who oppose democracy in Israel.{{sfn|Sperlich|2006|p=100}} The lawyer [[Alan Dershowitz]] has called Chomsky a \"false prophet of the left\";{{sfn|Barsky|1997|p=170}} Chomsky called Dershowitz \"a complete liar\" who is on \"a crazed jihad, dedicating much of his life to trying to destroy my reputation\".{{sfn|Barsky|1997|pp=170\u2013171}} In early 2016 President [[Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan]] of Turkey publicly rebuked Chomsky after he signed an [[open letter]] condemning Erdo\u011fan for his [[Kurdish\u2013Turkish conflict (1978\u2013present)#2015 PKK rebellion|anti-Kurdish repression]] and double standards on terrorism.{{sfn|Weaver|2016}} Chomsky accused Erdo\u011fan of hypocrisy, noting that Erdo\u011fan supports [[al-Qaeda]]'s Syrian affiliate,{{sfn|Sengupta|2015}} the [[al-Nusra Front]].{{sfn|Weaver|2016}}\n\nIn February 2020, before attending the 2020 [[Hay Festival]] in [[Abu Dhabi]], [[United Arab Emirates]], Chomsky signed a letter of condemnation of the violation of freedom of speech in the emirate, referring to the arrest of human rights activist [[Ahmed Mansoor]]. Other signers included authors [[Stephen Fry]] and [[Jung Chang]].{{sfn|Flood|2020}}\n\n===Academic achievements, awards, and honors===\n{{See also|List of honorary degrees awarded to Noam Chomsky}}\n[[File:Chomsky and Krieger.jpg|thumb|left|Chomsky receiving an award from the president of the [[Nuclear Age Peace Foundation]], David Krieger (2014)]]\n\nIn 1970, the London ''[[The Times|Times]]'' named Chomsky one of the \"makers of the twentieth century\".{{sfn|Baughman et al.|2006}} He was voted the world's leading [[public intellectual]] in [[The 2005 Global Intellectuals Poll]] jointly conducted by American magazine ''[[Foreign Policy]]'' and British magazine [[Prospect (magazine)|''Prospect'']].{{sfn|''Foreign Policy''|2005}} ''[[New Statesman]]'' readers listed Chomsky among the world's foremost heroes in 2006.{{sfn|Cowley|2006}}\n\nIn the United States he is a [[Member of the National Academy of Sciences]], the [[American Academy of Arts and Sciences]], the [[Linguistic Society of America]], the [[American Philosophical Association]], and the [[American Association for the Advancement of Science]].{{sfn|Contemporary Authors Online|2016}} Abroad he is a corresponding fellow of the [[British Academy]], an honorary member of the [[British Psychological Society]], a member of the [[Deutsche Akademie der Naturforscher Leopoldina]],{{sfn|Contemporary Authors Online|2016}} and a foreign member of the Department of Social Sciences of the [[Serbian Academy of Sciences and Arts]].{{sfn|SASA foreign membership|2003}} He received a 1971 [[Guggenheim Fellowship]], the 1984 [[American Psychological Association Award for Distinguished Contributions to Psychology]], the 1988 [[Kyoto Prize in Basic Sciences]], the 1996 [[Helmholtz Medal]],{{sfn|Contemporary Authors Online|2016}} the 1999 [[Benjamin Franklin Medal (Franklin Institute)|Benjamin Franklin Medal in Computer and Cognitive Science]],{{sfn|MIT Linguistics Program|2002}} the 2010 [[Erich Fromm Prize]],{{sfn|Deutsche Presse-Agentur|2010}} and the [[British Academy]]'s 2014 [[Neil and Saras Smith Medal for Linguistics]].{{sfn|British Academy|2014}} He is also a two-time winner of the [[NCTE George Orwell Award for Distinguished Contribution to Honesty and Clarity in Public Language]] (1987 and 1989).{{sfn|Contemporary Authors Online|2016}} He has also received the Rabindranath Tagore Centenary Award from [[The Asiatic Society]].{{sfn|''Soundings''|2002}}\n\nChomsky received the 2004 [[Carl von Ossietzky|Carl-von-Ossietzky]] Prize from the city of [[Oldenburg, Germany]], to acknowledge his body of work as a political analyst and media critic.{{sfn|Inventio Musikverlag}} He received an honorary fellowship in 2005 from the [[Literary and Historical Society (University College Dublin)|Literary and Historical Society of University College Dublin]].{{sfn|Soundtracksforthem: Interview|2005}} He received the 2008 President's Medal from the Literary and Debating Society of the [[National University of Ireland, Galway]].{{sfn|Desmond Tutu to speak to Litndeb|2009}} Since 2009, he has been an honorary member of [[International Association of Professional Translators and Interpreters]] (IAPTI).{{sfn|Honorary Members of IAPTI}} He received the University of Wisconsin's A.E.

The lectures just mentioned and other writings take on highly significant and sometimes not properly appreciated, and often misunderstood, developments in the history of science.\" {{harvcol|Otero|2003|p=416}}}} social critic, and political commentator. Sometimes called \"the father of modern linguistics\",{{efn|name=father}} Chomsky is also a major figure in [[analytic philosophy]] and one of the founders of the field of [[cognitive science]]. He holds a joint appointment as [[Institute Professor]] Emeritus at the [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]] (MIT) and [[Laureate]] Professor at the [[University of Arizona]], and is the author of more than 100 books on topics such as [[linguistics]], war, politics, and [[mass media]]. Ideologically, he aligns with [[anarcho-syndicalism]] and [[libertarian socialism]].\n\n<!--Early life up until 1966-->\nBorn to [[Ashkenazi]] [[Jews|Jewish]] immigrants in [[Philadelphia]], Chomsky developed an early interest in [[anarchism]] from alternative bookstores in [[New York City]]. He studied at the [[University of Pennsylvania]]. During his [[postgraduate]] work in the [[Harvard Society of Fellows]], Chomsky developed the theory of [[transformational grammar]] for which he earned his doctorate in 1955. That year he began teaching at MIT, and in 1957 emerged as a significant figure in linguistics with his landmark work ''[[Syntactic Structures]]'', which played a major role in remodeling the study of language. From 1958 to 1959 Chomsky was a [[National Science Foundation]] fellow at the [[Institute for Advanced Study]]. He created or co-created the [[Universal Grammar|universal grammar]] theory, the [[generative grammar]] theory, the [[Chomsky hierarchy]], and the [[minimalist program]]. Chomsky also played a pivotal role in the decline of linguistic [[behaviorism]], and was particularly critical of the work of [[B. F. Skinner]].\n\n<!--Later life post-1967-->\nAn outspoken [[Opposition to United States involvement in the Vietnam War|opponent]] of [[Role of the United States in the Vietnam War|U.S. involvement in the Vietnam War]], which he saw as an act of [[American imperialism]], in 1967 Chomsky rose to national attention for his antiwar essay \"[[The Responsibility of Intellectuals]]\". Associated with the [[New Left]], he was arrested multiple times for his activism and placed on President [[Richard Nixon]]'s [[Nixon's Enemies List|Enemies List]]. While expanding his work in linguistics over subsequent decades, he also became involved in the [[linguistics wars]]. In collaboration with [[Edward S. Herman]], Chomsky later articulated the [[propaganda model]] of [[media criticism]] in ''[[Manufacturing Consent]]'' and worked to expose the [[Indonesian occupation of East Timor]]. His defense of [[freedom of speech]], including [[Holocaust denial]], generated significant controversy in the [[Faurisson affair]] of the 1980s. Since retiring from MIT, he has continued his vocal political activism, including opposing the [[2003 invasion of Iraq]] and supporting the [[Occupy movement]]. Chomsky began teaching at the University of Arizona in 2017.\n\n<!--Brief assessment of Chomsky's reception and legacy:-->\nOne of the most cited scholars alive,{{sfn|''MIT Tech Talk''|1992}} Chomsky has influenced a broad array of academic fields. He is widely recognized as having helped to spark the [[cognitive revolution]] in the [[human sciences]], contributing to the development of a new [[Cognitivism (psychology)|cognitivistic]] framework for the study of [[language]] and the [[mind]]. In addition to his continued scholarship, he remains a leading [[Criticism of United States foreign policy|critic]] of [[U.S. foreign policy]], [[neoliberalism]] and contemporary [[state capitalism]], the [[Israeli\u2013Palestinian conflict]], and mainstream [[news media]]. His ideas have proven highly influential in the [[anti-capitalist]] and [[anti-imperialist]] movements, but have also drawn criticism, with some accusing Chomsky of [[anti-Americanism]].\n\n== Life ==\n===Childhood: 1928\u20131945===\nAvram Noam Chomsky was born on December 7, 1928, in the [[East Oak Lane, Philadelphia|East Oak Lane]] neighborhood of [[Philadelphia]], [[Pennsylvania]].{{sfnm|1a1=Lyons|1y=1978|1p=xv|2a1=Barsky|2y=1997|2p=9|3a1=McGilvray|3y=2014|3p=3}} His parents, [[Ze'ev \"William\" Chomsky]] and Elsie Simonofsky, were Jewish immigrants.{{sfnm|1a1=Barsky|1y=1997|1pp=9\u201310|2a1=Sperlich|2y=2006|2p=11}} William had fled the [[Russian Empire]] in 1913 to escape conscription and worked in [[Baltimore]] [[sweatshop]]s and Hebrew elementary schools before attending university.{{sfn|Barsky|1997|p=9}} After moving to Philadelphia, William became principal of the [[Congregation Mikveh Israel]] religious school and joined the [[Gratz College]] faculty. He placed great emphasis on educating people so that they would be \"well integrated, free and independent in their thinking, concerned about improving and enhancing the world, and eager to participate in making life more meaningful and worthwhile for all\", a mission that shaped and was subsequently adopted by his son.{{sfn|Barsky|1997|p=11}} Elsie was a teacher and activist born in [[Belarus]]. They met at Mikveh Israel, where they both worked.{{sfnm|1a1=Barsky|1y=1997|1pp=9\u201310|2a1=Sperlich|2y=2006|2p=11}}\n\nNoam was the Chomskys' first child.

Harris introduced Chomsky to the field of theoretical linguistics and convinced him to major in the subject.{{sfnm|1a1=Barsky|1y=1997|1pp=48\u201351|2a1=Sperlich|2y=2006|2pp=18\u201319, 31}} Chomsky's [[Bachelor of Arts|BA]] honors thesis, \"Morphophonemics of Modern Hebrew\", applied Harris's methods to the language.{{sfnm|1a1=Barsky|1y=1997|1pp=51\u201352|2a1=Sperlich|2y=2006|2p=32}} Chomsky revised this thesis for his [[Master of Arts|MA]], which he received from the University of Pennsylvania in 1951; it was subsequently published as a book.{{sfnm|1a1=Barsky|1y=1997|1pp=51\u201352|2a1=Sperlich|2y=2006|2p=33}} He also developed his interest in philosophy while at university, in particular under the tutelage of [[Nelson Goodman]].{{sfn|Sperlich|2006|p=33}}\n\nFrom 1951 to 1955 Chomsky was a member of the [[Society of Fellows]] at Harvard University, where he undertook research on what became his doctoral dissertation.{{sfnm|1a1=Lyons|1y=1978|1p=xv|2a1=Barsky|2y=1997|2p=79|3a1=Sperlich|3y=2006|3p=20}} Having been encouraged by Goodman to apply,{{sfn|Sperlich|2006|p=34}} Chomsky was attracted to Harvard in part because the philosopher [[Willard Van Orman Quine]] was based there. Both Quine and a visiting philosopher, [[J. L. Austin]] of the [[University of Oxford]], strongly influenced Chomsky.{{sfn|Sperlich|2006|pp=33\u201334}} In 1952 Chomsky published his first academic article, ''Systems of Syntactic Analysis'', which appeared not in a journal of linguistics but in ''[[The Journal of Symbolic Logic]]''.{{sfn|Sperlich|2006|p=34}} Highly critical of the established behaviorist currents in linguistics, in 1954 he presented his ideas at lectures at the [[University of Chicago]] and [[Yale University]].{{sfn|Barsky|1997|p=81}} He had not been registered as a student at Pennsylvania for four years, but in 1955 he submitted a thesis setting out his ideas on [[transformational grammar]]; he was awarded a [[Doctor of Philosophy]] degree for it, and it was privately distributed among specialists on microfilm before being published in 1975 as part of ''[[The Logical Structure of Linguistic Theory]]''.{{sfnm|1a1=Barsky|1y=1997|1pp=83\u201385|2a1=Sperlich|2y=2006|2p=36|3a1=McGilvray|3y=2014|3pp=4\u20135}} Harvard professor [[George Armitage Miller]] was impressed by Chomsky's thesis and collaborated with him on several technical papers in [[mathematical linguistics]].{{sfn|Sperlich|2006|p=38}} Chomsky's doctorate exempted him from [[compulsory military service]], which was otherwise due to begin in 1955.{{sfn|Sperlich|2006|p=36}}\n\nIn 1947 Chomsky began a romantic relationship with [[Carol Doris Schatz]], whom he had known since early childhood.

For example, although children are exposed to only a very small and finite subset of the allowable [[Sentence (linguistics)|syntactic variants]] within their first language, they somehow acquire the highly organized and systematic ability to understand and produce [[Digital infinity|an infinite number of sentences]], including ones that have never before been uttered, in that language.{{sfn|Dovey|2015}} To explain this, Chomsky reasoned that the primary linguistic data must be supplemented by an [[innate linguistic capacity]]. Furthermore, while a human baby and a kitten are both capable of [[inductive reasoning]], if they are exposed to exactly the same linguistic data, the human will always acquire the ability to understand and produce language, while the kitten will never acquire either ability. Chomsky labeled whatever relevant capacity the human has that the cat lacks the [[language acquisition device]], and suggested that one of linguists' tasks should be to determine what that device is and what constraints it imposes on the range of possible human languages.

He believes that official, sanctioned historical accounts of U.S. and British extraterritorial operations have consistently whitewashed these nations' actions in order to present them as having

[[Bretton Woods financial control agreement]].{{sfn|McGilvray|2014|p=14}} He characterizes the U.S. as a ''de facto'' [[one-party state]], viewing both the [[Republican Party (United

interests.{{sfn|McGilvray|2014|pp=14\u201315}} Chomsky highlights that, within Western capitalist liberal democracies, at least 80% of the population has no control over economic decisions, which are instead in the hands of a management class and ultimately controlled by a small, wealthy elite.{{sfn|McGilvray|2014|p=15}}\n\nNoting the entrenchment of such an economic system, Chomsky believes that change is possible through the organized cooperation of large numbers of people who understand the problem and know how they want to reorganize the economy more equitably.{{sfn|McGilvray|2014|p=15}} Acknowledging that corporate domination of media and government stifles any significant change to this system, he sees reason for optimism in historical examples such as the social rejection of slavery as immoral, the advances in women's rights, and the forcing of government to justify invasions.{{sfn|McGilvray|2014|p=14}} He views violent revolution to overthrow a government as a last

If we include Chomsky's political activism then the boundaries become quite blurred, and it comes as no surprise that Chomsky is increasingly seen as enemy number one by those who inhabit that wide sphere of reactionary discourse and action.\n | source = Sperlich, 2006{{sfn|Sperlich|2006|p=60}}\n}}\n\nChomsky has been a defining Western intellectual figure, central to the field of linguistics and definitive in cognitive science, computer science, philosophy, and psychology.{{sfn|Knight|2016|p=2}} In addition to being known as one of the most important intellectuals of his time,{{efn|name=important}} Chomsky carries a dual legacy as both a \"leader in the field\" of linguistics and \"a figure of enlightenment and inspiration\" for [[political dissent]]ers.{{sfn|Barsky|1997|p=191}} Despite his academic success, his political viewpoints and activism have resulted in his being distrusted by the mainstream media apparatus, and he is regarded as being \"on the outer margin of acceptability\".{{sfn|Sperlich|2006|p=24}} The reception of his work is intertwined with his public image as an anarchist, a gadfly, an historian, a Jew, a linguist, and a philosopher.{{sfn|Barsky|2007|p=107}}\n\n===In academia===\nMcGilvray observes that Chomsky inaugurated the \"[[cognitive revolution]]\" in linguistics,{{sfn|McGilvray|2014|p=5}} and that he is largely responsible for establishing the field as a formal, [[natural science]],{{sfn|McGilvray|2014|p=9}} moving it away from the procedural form of [[structural linguistics]] dominant during the mid-20th century.{{sfn|McGilvray|2014|pp=9\u201310}} As such, some have called Chomsky \"the father of modern linguistics\".{{efn|name=father}} Linguist John Lyons further remarked that within a few decades of publication, Chomskyan linguistics had become \"the most dynamic and influential\" school of thought in the field.{{sfn|Lyons|1978|p=2}} By the 1970s his work had also come to exert a considerable influence on philosophy,{{sfn|Sperlich|2006|p=42}} and a [[Minnesota State University Moorhead]] poll ranked ''Syntactic Structures'' as the single most important work in [[cognitive science]].{{sfn|MSUM Cognitive Sciences}} In addition, his work in [[automata theory]] and the Chomsky hierarchy have become well known in [[computer science]], and he is much cited in [[computational linguistics]].{{sfn|Sperlich|2006|p=39}}{{sfn|Sipser|1997}}{{sfn|Knuth at Stanford University|2003}}\n\nChomsky's criticisms of behaviorism contributed substantially to the decline of [[behaviorist psychology]];{{sfn|Graham|2019}} in addition, he is generally regarded as one of the primary founders of the field of cognitive science.{{sfn|Harris|2010}}{{sfn|McGilvray|2014|p=19}} Some arguments in [[evolutionary psychology]] are derived from his research results;{{sfn|Massey University|1996}} [[Nim Chimpsky]], a chimpanzee who was the subject of a study in [[animal language acquisition]] at Columbia University, was named after Chomsky in reference to his view of language acquisition as a uniquely human ability.{{sfn|Radick|2007|p=320}}\n\n[[ACM Turing Award]] winner [[Donald Knuth]] credited Chomsky's work with helping him combine his interests in mathematics, linguistics, and computer science.{{sfn|Knuth|2003|p=1}} [[IBM]] computer scientist [[John Backus]], another Turing Award winner, used some of Chomsky's concepts to help him develop [[FORTRAN]], the first widely used high-level [[computer programming language]].{{sfn|Fulton|2007}} The laureates of the 1984 [[Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine]]\u2014[[Georges J.

Sperlich characterizes him as \"one of the most notable contemporary champions of the people\";{{sfn|Sperlich|2006|p=7}} journalist [[John Pilger]] has described him as a \"genuine people's hero; an inspiration for struggles all over the world for that basic decency known as freedom. To a lot of people in the margins\u2014activists and movements\u2014he's unfailingly supportive.\"{{sfn|Jaggi|2001}} [[Arundhati Roy]] has called him \"one of the greatest, most radical public thinkers of our time\",{{sfn|Sperlich|2006|p=114}} and [[Edward Said]] thought him \"one of the most significant challengers of unjust power and delusions\".{{sfn|Jaggi|2001}} [[Fred Halliday]] has said that by the start of the 21st century Chomsky had become a \"guru\" for the world's anti-capitalist and anti-imperialist movements.{{sfn|Jaggi|2001}} The propaganda model of media criticism that he and Herman developed has been widely accepted in radical media critiques and adopted to some level in mainstream criticism of the media,{{sfn|Sperlich|2006|p=129}} also exerting a significant influence on the growth of [[alternative media]], including radio, publishers, and the Internet, which in turn have helped to disseminate his work.{{sfn|Sperlich|2006|p=142}}\n\nSperlich also notes that Chomsky has been vilified by corporate interests, particularly in the mainstream press.{{sfn|Sperlich|2006|p=10}} University departments devoted to history and political science rarely include Chomsky's work on their undergraduate syllabi.{{sfn|Barsky|1997|pp=153\u2013154}} Critics have argued that despite publishing widely on social and political issues, Chomsky has no formal expertise in these areas; he has responded that such issues are not as complex as many [[social science|social scientists]] claim and that almost everyone is able to comprehend them regardless of whether they have been academically trained to do so.{{sfn|McGilvray|2014|p=161}} According to McGilvray, many of Chomsky's critics \"do not bother quoting his work or quote out of context, distort, and create straw men that cannot be supported by Chomsky's text\".{{sfn|McGilvray|2014|p=161}}\n\nChomsky drew criticism for not calling the [[Srebrenica massacre]] during the [[Bosnian War]] a \"genocide\", which he said would devalue the word,{{sfn|Braun|2018}} and in appearing to deny [[Ed Vulliamy]]'s reporting on the existence of Bosnian concentration camps. The subsequent editorial correction of his comments, viewed as a capitulation, was criticized by multiple Balkan watchers.{{sfn|Nettelfield|2010|p=142}}\n\nChomsky's far-reaching criticisms of U.S. foreign policy and the legitimacy of U.S. power have raised controversy. A document obtained pursuant to a [[Freedom of Information Act (United States)|Freedom of Information Act]] (FOIA) request from the U.S. government revealed that the [[Central Intelligence Agency]] (CIA) monitored his activities and for years denied doing so. The CIA also destroyed its files on Chomsky at some point, possibly in violation of federal law.{{sfn|Hudson|2013}} He has often received undercover police protection at MIT and when speaking on the Middle East, but has refused uniformed police protection.{{sfn|Rabbani|2012}} German newspaper ''[[Der Spiegel]]'' described Chomsky as \"the Ayatollah of anti-American hatred\",{{sfn|Sperlich|2006|p=10}} while [[American conservatism|conservative]] commentator [[David Horowitz]] called him \"the most devious, the most dishonest and&nbsp;... the most treacherous intellect in America\", whose work is infused with \"anti-American dementia\" and evidences his \"pathological hatred of his own country\".{{sfn|Horowitz|2001}} Writing in ''[[Commentary (magazine)|Commentary]]'' magazine, the journalist [[Jonathan Kay]] described Chomsky as \"a hard-boiled anti-American monomaniac who simply refuses to believe anything that any American leader says\".{{sfn|Kay|2011}}\n\nChomsky's criticism of Israel has led to his being called a traitor to the Jewish people and an [[anti-Semitism|anti-Semite]].{{sfn|Sperlich|2006|p=100}} Criticizing Chomsky's defense of the right of individuals to engage in Holocaust denial on the grounds that freedom of speech must be extended to all viewpoints, [[Werner Cohn]] called Chomsky \"the most important patron\" of the [[Neo-Nazism|neo-Nazi]] movement.{{sfn|Cohn|1995|p=37}} The [[Anti-Defamation League]] (ADL), called him a Holocaust denier,{{sfn|Sperlich|2006|p=101}} describing him as a \"dupe of intellectual pride so overweening that he is incapable of making distinctions between totalitarian and democratic societies, between oppressors and victims\".{{sfn|Sperlich|2006|p=101}} In turn, Chomsky has claimed that the ADL is dominated by \"Stalinist types\" who oppose democracy in Israel.{{sfn|Sperlich|2006|p=100}} The lawyer [[Alan Dershowitz]] has called Chomsky a \"false prophet of the left\";{{sfn|Barsky|1997|p=170}} Chomsky called Dershowitz \"a complete liar\" who is on \"a crazed jihad, dedicating much of his life to trying to destroy my reputation\".{{sfn|Barsky|1997|pp=170\u2013171}} In early 2016 President [[Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan]] of Turkey publicly rebuked Chomsky after he signed an [[open letter]] condemning Erdo\u011fan for his [[Kurdish\u2013Turkish conflict (1978\u2013present)#2015 PKK rebellion|anti-Kurdish repression]] and double standards on terrorism.{{sfn|Weaver|2016}} Chomsky accused Erdo\u011fan of hypocrisy, noting that Erdo\u011fan supports [[al-Qaeda]]'s Syrian affiliate,{{sfn|Sengupta|2015}} the [[al-Nusra Front]].{{sfn|Weaver|2016}}\n\nIn February 2020, before attending the 2020 [[Hay Festival]] in [[Abu Dhabi]], [[United Arab Emirates]], Chomsky signed a letter of condemnation of the violation of freedom of speech in the emirate, referring to the arrest of human rights activist [[Ahmed Mansoor]].

As a breed, Akitas are generally hardy, but they have been known to be susceptible to various genetic conditions and can be sensitive to certain drugs.\n\nIn all countries except the United States, the Japanese and American strains of Akita are considered two separate breeds. In the United States, however, the two strains are considered a single breed with differences in type. For a while, the American strain of Akita was known in some countries as the Great Japanese Dog. Both forms of Akita are probably best known worldwide from the true story of [[Hachik\u014d]], a loyal Akita who lived in Japan before [[World War II]].\n\n[[File:KonatsumeGoTetsuyukisou.jpg|thumb|center]]\n\n==Breed name==\n{{multiple image\n | align = right\n | image1 =\n | alt1 = A large, orange dog on a beach, with small dark eyes and a fine appearance\n | width1 = 125\n | caption1 = A Japanese Akita\n | image2 = American-akita.jpg\n | alt2 = A large, dark gray dog with white legs and tail, with powerful features and a bulky appearance\n | width2 = 150\n | caption2 = An American Akita\n }}\nThere is debate among fanciers whether there are two separate breeds of Akita.

As a result, a lot of specimens started to lose their spitz characteristics and instead took on drop ears, straight tails, non-Japanese color (black masks, and any color other than red, white or brindle), and loose skin. A native Japanese breed known as Matagi (hunting dog) was used along with the Hokkaido Inu breed to mix back into the remaining Akita Inu to bring back the spitz phenotype and restore the Akita breed. The modern day Japanese Akita have relatively few genes from western dogs and are spitz in phenotype after the reconstruction of the breed took place, however the larger American breed of Akita largely descends from the mixed Akita before the restoration of the breed, and thus American Akita are typically mixed and not considered true Akita by the Japanese standard.<ref name=\"Aki9\">{{cite web|title=Akita Inu|url=http://japanesedogs.bulldoginformation.com/japanese-akita-inu.html|publisher=Japanesedogs|accessdate=5 November 2019}}</ref>\n\nThe Akita were used during the [[Russo-Japanese War]] to track prisoners of war and lost sailors.<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite book|last=Allsopp|first=Nigel|title=K9 Cops: Police Dogs of the World|publisher=Big Sky Publishing|year=2012|isbn=|location=|pages=}}</ref> During [[World War II]] the Akita was also crossed with [[German Shepherd]]s in an attempt to save them from the wartime government order for all non-military dogs to be culled.<ref name=JAICUK>{{cite web|title=Akita Inu Breed History|url=http://www.japaneseakita-inu.co.uk/Files/History.htm|publisher=Japanese Akita Inu Club Great Britain|accessdate=29 April 2011}}</ref> Some were used as scouts and guards during the war.<ref name=\":1\" /> The ancestors of the American Akita were originally a variety of the Japanese Akita, a form that was not desired in Japan due to the markings, and which is not eligible for show competition.<ref name=\"DVM\"/>[[File:Fels.jpg|thumb|Brindle Japanese Akitas]]\nThe story of [[Hachik\u014d]], the most revered Akita of all time, helped push the Akita into the international dog world.

As a breed, Akitas are generally hardy, but they have been known to be susceptible to various genetic conditions and can be sensitive to certain drugs.\n\nIn all countries except the United States, the Japanese and American strains of Akita are considered two separate breeds. In the United States, however, the two strains are considered a single breed with differences in type. For a while, the American strain of Akita was known in some countries as the Great Japanese Dog. Both forms of Akita are probably best known worldwide from the true story of [[Hachik\u014d]], a loyal Akita who lived in Japan before [[World War II]].\n\nimage = File:KonatsumeGoTetsuyukisou.jpg\n\n==Breed name==\n{{multiple image\n | align = right\n | image1 =\n | alt1 = A large, orange dog on a beach, with small dark eyes and a fine appearance\n | width1 = 125\n | caption1 = A Japanese Akita\n | image2 = American-akita.jpg\n | alt2 = A large, dark gray dog with white legs and tail, with powerful features and a bulky appearance\n | width2 = 150\n | caption2 = An American Akita\n }}\nThere is debate among fanciers whether there are two separate breeds of Akita.

As a result, a lot of specimens started to lose their spitz characteristics and instead took on drop ears, straight tails, non-Japanese color (black masks, and any color other than red, white or brindle), and loose skin. A native Japanese breed known as Matagi (hunting dog) was used along with the Hokkaido Inu breed to mix back into the remaining Akita Inu to bring back the spitz phenotype and restore the Akita breed. The modern day Japanese Akita have relatively few genes from western dogs and are spitz in phenotype after the reconstruction of the breed took place, however the larger American breed of Akita largely descends from the mixed Akita before the restoration of the breed, and thus American Akita are typically mixed and not considered true Akita by the Japanese standard.<ref name=\"Aki9\">{{cite web|title=Akita Inu|url=http://japanesedogs.bulldoginformation.com/japanese-akita-inu.html|publisher=Japanesedogs|accessdate=5 November 2019}}</ref>\n\nThe Akita were used during the [[Russo-Japanese War]] to track prisoners of war and lost sailors.<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite book|last=Allsopp|first=Nigel|title=K9 Cops: Police Dogs of the World|publisher=Big Sky Publishing|year=2012|isbn=|location=|pages=}}</ref> During [[World War II]] the Akita was also crossed with [[German Shepherd]]s in an attempt to save them from the wartime government order for all non-military dogs to be culled.<ref name=JAICUK>{{cite web|title=Akita Inu Breed History|url=http://www.japaneseakita-inu.co.uk/Files/History.htm|publisher=Japanese Akita Inu Club Great Britain|accessdate=29 April 2011}}</ref> Some were used as scouts and guards during the war.<ref name=\":1\" /> The ancestors of the American Akita were originally a variety of the Japanese Akita, a form that was not desired in Japan due to the markings, and which is not eligible for show competition.<ref name=\"DVM\"/>[[File:Fels.jpg|thumb|Brindle Japanese Akitas]]\nThe story of [[Hachik\u014d]], the most revered Akita of all time, helped push the Akita into the international dog world.

The Bayou Beast franchise was owned by James (Sr.) and Carolyn Shiver, who currently own and operate the NIFL which is based in [[Lafayette, Louisiana]].

In 1999, the PIFL changed its name to the IPFL, and the Beast changed arenas, moving to the [[Riverside Centroplex]] in downtown Baton Rouge for that season.\n\nAfter two seasons, the Bayou Beast moved to [[Alexandria, Louisiana|Alexandria]]. and were renamed the [[Louisiana Rangers]] for the IPFL 2000 season.\n\nThe team was reincarnated in 2001 for the [[National Indoor Football League]], and based in [[Monroe, Louisiana]]. Following that season, the franchise folded.\n\n==1998 PIFL season==\n\nThe Bayou Beast played its inaugural game on the road against the [[Madison Mad Dogs]] on April 10, 1998. They won the game 36\u201328 in front of a crowd of 4,283. The team logo, consisting of a raging \"Beast\" busting through his football uniform, known as \"Blitz\". Some spectators said that the \"Bayou Beast\" logo (Blitz) looked like \"a raccoon on steroids\".\n\nIn their first year, they won 13 out of 14 games (losing only to the [[Colorado Wildcats]] 41\u201349 on May 9, 1998) to win the [[Professional Indoor Football League (1998)|PIFL]]'s first regular season title. With a 10-game win streak to end the season, the Bayou Beast were seeded in the #1 position with the home field advantage throughout the playoffs.\n\n==PIFL Playoff Semifinals==\n\nTheir first playoff game would be against the #4 ranked [[Colorado Wildcats]]. A couple of key events took place before the opening kickoff of this game. First, the [[Pete Maravich Assembly Center]], home arena of the Bayou Beast, could not be used since it was previously booked for that weekend. A deal was worked out with the [[Riverside Centroplex]] to host the Beast's first playoff game. Secondly, the owner of the [[Colorado Wildcats]] was financially strapped by the end of the season and was about to forfeit their playoff appearance rather than pay travel costs to Baton Rouge. The Shivers, the Bayou Beast owners, offered to pay travel expenses for the Wildcats to compete against the Beast. This would also be their chance to avenge the only loss of the season by defeating them in the playoffs. The Bayou Beast did just that by winning 67\u201351.\n\n==PIFL Championship Game==\n\n<!-- Image with inadequate rationale removed: [[Image:Champ-PIFL98.jpg|right]] -->\nThe only [[Professional Indoor Football League (1998)|PIFL]] Championship game was hosted in Baton Rouge, back in the [[Pete Maravich Assembly Center]].<ref name=\"advbr980715\"/> It pitted the #1 Louisiana Bayou Beast versus the second-seeded [[Madison Mad Dogs]] who had defeated their sister team (both teams owned by [[Keary Ecklund]]), the #3 [[Green Bay Bombers]] 46\u201319.  Louisiana quarterback Doug Coleman hit receiver Derrick Fobb with a 20-yard touchdown pass with no time remaining to give the Louisiana Bayou Beast the inaugural Professional Indoor Football League championship by a 42-41 margin. Coleman fumbled the snap on the big play but managed to pick up the ball and run out of trouble before spotting Fobb alone in the end zone. Matt Huerkamp, the league's top kicker, nailed the extra point for the win. Coleman's throw, his fourth scoring toss of the evening, came one play after Madison was penalized for a facemask penalty, giving the Bayou Beast one final untimed down.\n\nMadison had taken a 41\u201335 lead with just 18.3 seconds remaining on a Raymond Philyaw to Mandrell Dean strike. On the play, Dean leaped between two defenders to pull down what at the time looked like the decisive score. Following the Mad Dogs' touchdown, Coleman hit Michael Lewis with a throw to set the Bayou Beast up in Madison territory. The [[Madison Mad Dogs]] defense stiffened, first coming up with a sack and then pressuring Coleman into an incomplete pass. The failed pass attempt would have been the final play of the game; however, an incidental facemask penalty gave Louisiana one last shot.\n\n==Louisiana Bayou Beast 1998 PIFL schedule==\n*March 28\u2020 \u2013 [[Texas Bullets]] 39, at Louisiana Bayou Beast 62\n*April 4\u2020 \u2013 [[Utah Catzz]] 42, at Louisiana Bayou Beast 40\n\u2020 Pre-Season PIFL games\n*April 10 \u2013 Louisiana Bayou Beast 36, at [[Madison Mad Dogs]] 28\n*April 19 \u2013 [[Madison Mad Dogs]] 33, at Louisiana Bayou Beast 67\n*May 9 \u2013 Louisiana Bayou Beast 41, at [[Colorado Wildcats]] 49\n*May 16 \u2013 Louisiana Bayou Beast 44, at [[Utah Catzz]] 14\n*May 23 \u2013 [[Texas Bullets]] 51, at Louisiana Bayou Beast 56\n*May 30 \u2013 Louisiana Bayou Beast 57, at [[Green Bay Bombers]] 40\n*June 6 \u2013 [[Honolulu Hurricanes]] 59, at Louisiana Bayou Beast 69\n*June 13 \u2013 Louisiana Bayou Beast 40, at [[Texas Bullets]] 37\n*June 20 \u2013 [[Utah Catzz]] 16, at Louisiana Bayou Beast 43\n*June 27 \u2013 [[Green Bay Bombers]] 22, at Louisiana Bayou Beast 29\n*July 4 \u2013 [[Minnesota Monsters]] at Louisiana Bayou Beast \u2013 Minnesota forfeits\n*July 4 \u2013 [[Syracuse Blitz]] 18, at Louisiana Bayou Beast 39\u2021\n\u2021 this game scheduled as an exhibition game to replace the forfeit\n*July 11 \u2013 [[Colorado Wildcats]] 22, at Louisiana Bayou Beast 31\n*July 19 \u2013 Louisiana Bayou Beast at [[Minnesota Monsters]] \u2013 Minnesota forfeits\n*August 2 \u2013 Louisiana Bayou Beast 52, at [[Honolulu Hurricanes]] 29\nPLAYOFFS\n*August 9 \u2013 [[Colorado Wildcats]] 51, at Louisiana Bayou Beast 67\nPIFL CHAMPIONSHIP\n*August 15 \u2013 [[Madison Mad Dogs]] 41, at Louisiana Bayou Beast 42\n\n===1999 IPFL season===\nIn 1999, the Beast started off with a new arena [[Riverside Centroplex]], two new head coaches (Jeff Majors & Chris Carrier) [https://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/theadvocate/access/41183427.html?dids=41183427:41183427&FMT=ABS&FMTS=ABS:FT&date=Apr+8%2C+1999&author=&pub=Advocate&edition=&startpage=7.C&desc=Beast+meet+Fire+Dogs+in+opener], a new [[general manager|GM]] (Les Crooks, formerly GM of the [[ECHL]] [[Baton Rouge Kingfish]]) [https://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/theadvocate/access/41180370.html?dids=41180370:41180370&FMT=ABS&FMTS=ABS:FT&date=Mar+23%2C+1999&author=SHELDON+MICKLES&pub=Advocate&edition=&startpage=1.D&desc=Bayou+Beast+G.M.+enjoys+challenge], a local television and production deal to air the games tape-delayed along with a weekly coach's show, ''Wall2Wall Football'' (KTTE 11 \u2013 Ind.

The Beast lost their season opener on the road to the [[Mississippi Firedogs]] 35\u201345 in front of a crowd of 5,138. Then, the new GM left the team and the production company was dropped after they failed to record the first home game correctly. The Beast media relations director took over as Interim GM [https://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/theadvocate/access/41183816.html?dids=41183816:41183816&FMT=ABS&FMTS=ABS:FT&date=Apr+13%2C+1999&author=&pub=Advocate&edition=&startpage=7.D&desc=Bayou+Beast+G.M.+leaves+IPFL+team] until the position was filled with Ted \"Rock\" Knapp from [[Houston, Texas]] [https://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/theadvocate/access/41339957.html?dids=41339957:41339957&FMT=ABS&FMTS=ABS:FT&date=May+7%2C+1999&author=&pub=Advocate&edition=&startpage=5.E&desc=Knapp+named+G.M.+for+Bayou+Beast+club]. After trying Co-Head Coaches for the '99 Bayou Beast, the team had a 2\u20135 record going into an off week. During that off time, Ted \"Rock\" Knapp was promoted to Head Coach/General Manager of the Bayou Beast and Coaches Majors and Carrier were terminated.\n\n====Chris Beard spinal cord injury====\nThe first game for the \"Rock\" as head coach of the Bayou Beast was at home against the [[Texas Terminators]]. During the game, when Chris Beard tackled Texas wideout Cory Caesar, Beard's head snapped back. This broke his neck and he was not able to move. He laid motionless for 30 minutes on the field. His condition was unknown to other players and spectators after his being taken to Our Lady of the Lake Hospital. During the delay, both the Louisiana Bayou Beast and the Texas Terminators got together at midfield, kneeled, and prayed for Beard. The next day, Beard underwent a seven-hour surgery to his neck. He was in [[intensive care]] at the hospital. The hit left him paralyzed in his arms and legs. [https://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/theadvocate/access/42223278.html?dids=42223278:42223278&FMT=ABS&FMTS=ABS:FT&date=Jun+8%2C+1999&author=&pub=Advocate&edition=&startpage=1.D&desc=Beast%27s+Beard+in+critical+condition]  Dr. Steven Bailey performed the surgery and said his diagnosis was undetermined at this time. Television station [[WAFB]] 9 ([[CBS]] \u2013 Baton Rouge) reported that Beard's neck may have been injured on an earlier play and showed a film clip of it on their 10pm local news. Additionally, throughout the game, Beard had failed to attach his chin strap on his helmet. It is undetermined if it was attached on the play he was injured or injured more severely by not having it attached. A trust fund was set up at a local bank for donations to help with the hospital costs. [https://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/theadvocate/access/42291820.html?dids=42291820:42291820&FMT=ABS&FMTS=ABS:FT&date=Jun+10%2C+1999&author=&pub=Advocate&edition=&startpage=2.E&desc=BRIEFS]\n\n====Longest game in IPFL history====\nThe next Bayou Beast game, against arch-rival [[Mississippi Fire Dogs]] at home, was dedicated to Chris Beard. The Beast would donate 25% of all ticket sales (till the end of the season) into the Chris Beard trust fund [https://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/theadvocate/access/42291820.html?dids=42291820:42291820&FMT=ABS&FMTS=ABS:FT&date=Jun+10%2C+1999&author=&pub=Advocate&edition=&startpage=2.E&desc=BRIEFS]. Replica jerseys of Beard's and other merchandise were sold to raise money for the fund, and a giant six-foot \"Get Well\" card was signed at the gate by all who attended this game. The team asked the league if they could remove the \"Beast\" logo from the side of their helmets for the rest of the '99 IPFL season, as their tribute to Chris. The league denied their request for the logo but granted permission for the removal of the yellow stripe on the top of the helmet. From that game on, every Bayou Beast game would be played without a stripe on the helmet.\nThe Bayou Beast won with a 31-yard [[Field goal (football)|field goal]] by Mike Shafer during the second overtime period, making this the longest [[IPFL]] game ever played. [https://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/theadvocate/access/42400290.html?dids=42400290:42400290&FMT=ABS&FMTS=ABS:FT&date=Jun+15%2C+1999&author=&pub=Advocate&edition=&startpage=6.D&desc=IPFL+honors+pair+of+Bayou+Beasts]\n\n====Third head coach change during 1999 season====\nOn July 13, the Bayou Beast released head coach Ted \"Rock\" Knapp. No reason was given. Knapp had a record of 2-3 as head coach and 3-5 since joining the Bayou Beast as the general manager. The following day, Barrett Murphy was named the new head coach of the Louisiana Bayou Beast. Barrett brought back Jeff Majors as the offensive coordinator, and Gary Frank remained with the team as linesman coach.\n\nThe first test for Murphy and the Bayou Beast was a heartbreaking loss to the first place [[Texas Terminators]], 16\u201323.

in the [[National Indoor Football League]] (NIFL). The Bayou Beast franchise was owned by James (Sr.) and Carolyn Shiver, who currently own and operate the NIFL which is based in [[Lafayette, Louisiana]]. The Bayou Beast competed in the PIFL in 1998, playing their home games at the [[Pete Maravich Assembly Center]] on the [[Louisiana State University|LSU]] campus in [[Baton Rouge, Louisiana|Baton Rouge]].<ref name=\"advbr980715\">{{cite news |first=Scott |last=Gremillion |newspaper=[[The Advocate (Louisiana)|The Advocate]] |location=Baton Rouge, Louisiana |title= Beast may have to find new home|page=1D |date=July 15, 1998 |quote=The inaugural Professional Indoor Football League championship game could be the last contest for the Louisiana Bayou Beast in LSU's Pete Maravich Assembly Center.}}</ref> The team colors were red, black, and white. In 1999, the PIFL changed its name to the IPFL, and the Beast changed arenas, moving to the [[Riverside Centroplex]] in downtown Baton Rouge for that season.\n\nAfter two seasons, the Bayou Beast moved to [[Alexandria, Louisiana|Alexandria]]. and were renamed the [[Louisiana Rangers]] for the IPFL 2000 season.\n\nThe team was reincarnated in 2001 for the [[National Indoor Football League]], and based in [[Monroe, Louisiana]]. Following that season, the franchise folded.\n\n==1998 PIFL season==\n\nThe Bayou Beast played its inaugural game on the road against the [[Madison Mad Dogs]] on April 10, 1998. They won the game 36-28 in front of a crowd of 4,283. The team logo, consisting of a raging \"Beast\" busting through his football uniform, known as \"Blitz\". Some spectators said that the \"Bayou Beast\" logo (Blitz) looked like \"a raccoon on steroids\".\n\nIn their first year, they won 13 out of 14 games (losing only to the [[Colorado Wildcats]] 41-49 on May 9, 1998) to win the [[Professional Indoor Football League (1998)|PIFL]]'s first regular season title. With a 10-game win streak to end the season, the Bayou Beast were seeded in the #1 position with the home field advantage throughout the playoffs.\n\n==PIFL Playoff Semifinals==\n\nTheir first playoff game would be against the #4 ranked [[Colorado Wildcats]]. A couple of key events took place before the opening kickoff of this game. First, the [[Pete Maravich Assembly Center]], home arena of the Bayou Beast, could not be used since it was previously booked for that weekend. A deal was worked out with the [[Riverside Centroplex]] to host the Beast's first playoff game. Secondly, the owner of the [[Colorado Wildcats]] was financially strapped by the end of the season and was about to forfeit their playoff appearance rather than pay travel costs to Baton Rouge. The Shivers, the Bayou Beast owners, offered to pay travel expenses for the Wildcats to compete against the Beast. This would also be their chance to avenge the only loss of the season by defeating them in the playoffs. The Bayou Beast did just that by winning 67-51.\n\n==PIFL Championship Game==\n\n<!-- Image with inadequate rationale removed: [[Image:Champ-PIFL98.jpg|right]] -->\nThe only [[Professional Indoor Football League (1998)|PIFL]] Championship game was hosted in Baton Rouge, back in the [[Pete Maravich Assembly Center]].<ref name=\"advbr980715\"/> It pitted the #1 Louisiana Bayou Beast versus the second-seeded [[Madison Mad Dogs]] who had defeated their sister team (both teams owned by [[Keary Ecklund]]), the #3 [[Green Bay Bombers]] 46-19.  Louisiana quarterback Doug Coleman hit receiver Derrick Fobb with a 20-yard touchdown pass with no time remaining to give the Louisiana Bayou Beast the inaugural Professional Indoor Football League championship by a 42-41 margin. Coleman fumbled the snap on the big play but managed to pick up the ball and run out of trouble before spotting Fobb alone in the end zone. Matt Huerkamp, the league's top kicker, nailed the extra point for the win. Coleman's throw, his fourth scoring toss of the evening, came one play after Madison was penalized for a facemask penalty, giving the Bayou Beast one final untimed down.\n\nMadison had taken a 41-35 lead with just 18.3 seconds remaining on a Raymond Philyaw to Mandrell Dean strike. On the play, Dean leaped between two defenders to pull down what at the time looked like the decisive score. Following the Mad Dogs' touchdown, Coleman hit Michael Lewis with a throw to set the Bayou Beast up in Madison territory. The [[Madison Mad Dogs]] defense stiffened, first coming up with a sack and then pressuring Coleman into an incomplete pass. The failed pass attempt would have been the final play of the game; however, an incidental facemask penalty gave Louisiana one last shot.\n\n==Louisiana Bayou Beast 1998 PIFL schedule==\n*March 28\u2020 \u2013 [[Texas Bullets]] 39, at Louisiana Bayou Beast 62\n*April 4\u2020 \u2013 [[Utah Catzz]] 42, at Louisiana Bayou Beast 40\n\u2020 Pre-Season PIFL games\n*April 10 \u2013 Louisiana Bayou Beast 36, at [[Madison Mad Dogs]] 28\n*April 19 \u2013 [[Madison Mad Dogs]] 33, at Louisiana Bayou Beast 67\n*May 9 \u2013 Louisiana Bayou Beast 41, at [[Colorado Wildcats]] 49\n*May 16 \u2013 Louisiana Bayou Beast 44, at [[Utah Catzz]] 14\n*May 23 \u2013 [[Texas Bullets]] 51, at Louisiana Bayou Beast 56\n*May 30 \u2013 Louisiana Bayou Beast 57, at [[Green Bay Bombers]] 40\n*June 6 \u2013 [[Honolulu Hurricanes]] 59, at Louisiana Bayou Beast 69\n*June 13 \u2013 Louisiana Bayou Beast 40, at [[Texas Bullets]] 37\n*June 20 \u2013 [[Utah Catzz]] 16, at Louisiana Bayou Beast 43\n*June 27 \u2013 [[Green Bay Bombers]] 22, at Louisiana Bayou Beast 29\n*July 4 \u2013 [[Minnesota Monsters]] at Louisiana Bayou Beast \u2013 Minnesota forfeits\n*July 4 \u2013 [[Syracuse Blitz]] 18, at Louisiana Bayou Beast 39\u2021\n\u2021 this game scheduled as an exhibition game to replace the forfeit\n*July 11 \u2013 [[Colorado Wildcats]] 22, at Louisiana Bayou Beast 31\n*July 19 \u2013 Louisiana Bayou Beast at [[Minnesota Monsters]] \u2013 Minnesota forfeits\n*August 2 \u2013 Louisiana Bayou Beast 52, at [[Honolulu Hurricanes]] 29\nPLAYOFFS\n*August 9 \u2013 [[Colorado Wildcats]] 51, at Louisiana Bayou Beast 67\nPIFL CHAMPIONSHIP\n*August 15 \u2013 [[Madison Mad Dogs]] 41, at Louisiana Bayou Beast 42\n\n===1999 IPFL season===\nIn 1999, the Beast started off with a new arena [[Riverside Centroplex]], two new head coaches (Jeff Majors & Chris Carrier) [https://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/theadvocate/access/41183427.html?dids=41183427:41183427&FMT=ABS&FMTS=ABS:FT&date=Apr+8%2C+1999&author=&pub=Advocate&edition=&startpage=7.C&desc=Beast+meet+Fire+Dogs+in+opener], a new [[general manager|GM]] (Les Crooks, formerly GM of the [[ECHL]] [[Baton Rouge Kingfish]]) [https://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/theadvocate/access/41180370.html?dids=41180370:41180370&FMT=ABS&FMTS=ABS:FT&date=Mar+23%2C+1999&author=SHELDON+MICKLES&pub=Advocate&edition=&startpage=1.D&desc=Bayou+Beast+G.M.+enjoys+challenge], a local television and production deal to air the games tape-delayed along with a weekly coach's show, ''Wall2Wall Football'' (KTTE 11 \u2013 Ind.

During the game, when Chris Beard tackled Texas wideout Cory Caesar, Beard's head snapped back. This broke his neck and he was not able to move. He laid motionless for 30 minutes on the field. His condition was unknown to other players and spectators after his being taken to Our Lady of the Lake Hospital. During the delay, both the Louisiana Bayou Beast and the Texas Terminators got together at midfield, kneeled, and prayed for Beard. The next day, Beard underwent a seven-hour surgery to his neck. He was in [[intensive care]] at the hospital. The hit left him paralyzed in his arms and legs.

Television station [[WAFB]] 9 ([[CBS]] \u2013 Baton Rouge) reported that Beard's neck may have been injured on an earlier play and showed a film clip of it on their 10pm local news. Additionally, throughout the game, Beard had failed to attach his chin strap on his helmet. It is undetermined if it was attached on the play he was injured or injured more severely by not having it attached. A trust fund was set up at a local bank for donations to help with the hospital costs.

Replica jerseys of Beard's and other merchandise were sold to raise money for the fund, and a giant six-foot \"Get Well\" card was signed at the gate by all who attended this game. The team asked the league if they could remove the \"Beast\" logo from the side of their helmets for the rest of the '99 IPFL season, as their tribute to Chris. The league denied their request for the logo but granted permission for the removal of the yellow stripe on the top of the helmet. From that game on, every Bayou Beast game would be played without a stripe on the helmet.\nThe Bayou Beast won with a 31-yard [[Field goal (football)|field goal]] by Mike Shafer during the second overtime period, making this the longest [[IPFL]] game ever played.

Knapp had a record of 2-3 as head coach and 3-5 since joining the Bayou Beast as the general manager. The following day, Barrett Murphy was named the new head coach of the Louisiana Bayou Beast. Barrett brought back Jeff Majors as the offensive coordinator, and Gary Frank remained with the team as linesman coach.\n\nThe first test for Murphy and the Bayou Beast was a heartbreaking loss to the first place [[Texas Terminators]], 16-23.

{"title_page": "Long song", "text_new": "{{Expert needed|Music genres|talk=Section title goes here|date=March 2011}}\nThe '''long song''' ({{lang-mn|{{MongolUnicode|\u1824\u1837\u1832\u1820\u202f\u1822\u1822\u1828<br />\u1833\u1820\u182d\u1824\u1828}}}}, ''Urtiin duu'') is one of the central elements of the traditional [[music of Mongolia]]. This genre is called \"Long song\" not only because the songs are long, but also because each [[syllable]] of text is extended for a long duration. A four-minute song may only consist of ten words. Certain long songs such as '''''Uvgin shuvuu khoyor''''', also known as '''''Jargaltain delger''''' (lit. 'Old man and the Bird') has a length of up to 3 hours if to sing in full length with complete 32 stanzas. Lyrical themes vary depending on context; they can be philosophical, religious, romantic, or celebratory, and often use horses as a symbol or theme repeated throughout the song. Eastern Mongols typically use a [[Morin khuur]] (horse-head fiddle) as accompaniment, sometimes with a type of indigenous [[flute]], called ''limbe''. [[Oirats|Oirat]] groups of the Western Mongols traditionally sing long songs unaccompanied or accompanied with the [[Igil]].\n\nMongolian folk long song embraces a comprehensive nature of all national traditions and customs, including history, culture, aesthetics, ethics and philosophy. The main feature of the long song is the ''shuranhai'' (prolonged, [[tenuto]] notes with deeply modulated vibrato on the [[vowels]]). The Mongol aizam long songs are ancient grand songs that possess extensively broad vocal diapason and diverse [[extended technique|vocal movement techniques]], elaborate singing elements and [[musical improvisation|vocal improvisations]] such as ''dan'' (single) and ''davkhar'' (double) ''shurankhai'' (tenuto notes with deeply modulated [[vibrato]] on the vowels), ''nugalaa'' (sharp notes modulated in lower pitch), various vocal \u2018soothing\u2019 long-drawns, upward and downward ''usrelt'' ([[musical tone|tone]] leaps or sudden transmission to higher or lower tones), ''tsokhilgo'' ([[modulation (music)|vocal modulated]] pulsation), ''tsatslaga'' (sprinkling), ''khayalga'' (bestrewing or free improvised tone), ''shigshree'' (sifting or repeated vocal [[vibration]]) and other unique singing techniques.<ref>'Sunny Mongolia today' International magazine for Mongolian railway passengers, Issue #17. p.64-65. 2012]</ref> These features give the long song profound philosophical, meditational character, often depicting the spacious mountain valleys and a sense of tranquility, believed to represent the Mongolian soul.\n\nThree major styles are identified in long songs: ''besreg urtiin duu'' (\"minor long song\"), ''suman urtiin duu'' (\"ordinary long song\") and ''aizam urtiin duu'' (\"major' or majestic long songs\"). Again, the styles reflect the way of the performance of the ''shuranhai'' and other techniques rather than the sizes of the songs. The word \u2018Aizam\u2019 comes from the non-lexical [[vocable]] of \u2018Aya, zee khu\u2019 at the beginning of the grand long song, which features a broad melody with a context of philosophical theme, ceremony and quality of ode, honor, respect or solemnity. The ''aizam'' grand long songs are sung in a sequence at the beginning of a ceremony or feast, in accordance with the special ceremonial rules, and constitute the summit of the long songs which test the skills and capability of the singer and morin khuur (horse-headed fiddle) player.<ref>'Sunny Mongolia today' International magazine for Mongolian railway passengers, Issue #17. p.64-65. 2012]</ref>\n\n== Modern history ==\n\n[[UNESCO]] declared the Mongolian Long Song one of the [[Masterpieces of the Oral and Intangible Heritage of Humanity]] in 2005.\n\nOn April 12, 2013, the ''''''Mongolian Statehood Long Song'''''' was officially exalted at the Mongolian Statehood History Museum located in the State Ceremony Great Hall of the Government House of Mongolia.<ref>[http://www.24tsag.mn/content/30264.shtml News on the exaltation of Mongolian Statehood Long Song at the Statehood History Museum on Mongolian news site.

This genre is called \"Long song\" not only because the songs are long, but also because each [[syllable]] of text is extended for a long duration. A four-minute song may only consist of ten words. Certain long songs such as '''''Uvgin shuvuu khoyor''''', also known as '''''Jargaltain delger''''' (lit. 'Old man and the Bird') has a length of up to 3 hours if to sing in full length with complete 32 stanzas. Lyrical themes vary depending on context; they can be philosophical, religious, romantic, or celebratory, and often use horses as a symbol or theme repeated throughout the song. Eastern Mongols typically use a [[Morin khuur]] (horse-head fiddle) as accompaniment, sometimes with a type of indigenous [[flute]], called ''limbe''. [[Oirats|Oirat]] groups of the Western Mongols traditionally sing long songs unaccompanied or accompanied with the [[Igil]].\n\nMongolian folk long song embraces a comprehensive nature of all national traditions and customs, including history, culture, aesthetics, ethics and philosophy. The main feature of the long song is the ''shuranhai'' (prolonged, [[tenuto]] notes with deeply modulated vibrato on the [[vowels]]). The Mongol aizam long songs are ancient grand songs that possess extensively broad vocal diapason and diverse [[extended technique|vocal movement techniques]], elaborate singing elements and [[musical improvisation|vocal improvisations]] such as ''dan'' (single) and ''davkhar'' (double) ''shurankhai'' (tenuto notes with deeply modulated [[vibrato]] on the vowels), ''nugalaa'' (sharp notes modulated in lower pitch), various vocal \u2018soothing\u2019 long-drawns, upward and downward ''usrelt'' ([[musical tone|tone]] leaps or sudden transmission to higher or lower tones), ''tsokhilgo'' ([[modulation (music)|vocal modulated]] pulsation), ''tsatslaga'' (sprinkling), ''khayalga'' (bestrewing or free improvised tone), ''shigshree'' (sifting or repeated vocal [[vibration]]) and other unique singing techniques.<ref>'Sunny Mongolia today' International magazine for Mongolian railway passengers, Issue #17. p.64-65. 2012]</ref> These features give the long song profound philosophical, meditational character, often depicting the spacious mountain valleys and a sense of tranquility, believed to represent the Mongolian soul.\n\nThree major styles are identified in long songs: ''besreg urtiin duu'' (\"minor long song\"), ''suman urtiin duu'' (\"ordinary long song\") and ''aizam urtiin duu'' (\"major' or majestic long songs\"). Again, the styles reflect the way of the performance of the ''shuranhai'' and other techniques rather than the sizes of the songs. The word \u2018Aizam\u2019 comes from the non-lexical [[vocable]] of \u2018Aya, zee khu\u2019 at the beginning of the grand long song, which features a broad melody with a context of philosophical theme, ceremony and quality of ode, honor, respect or solemnity. The ''aizam'' grand long songs are sung in a sequence at the beginning of a ceremony or feast, in accordance with the special ceremonial rules, and constitute the summit of the long songs which test the skills and capability of the singer and morin khuur (horse-headed fiddle) player.<ref>'Sunny Mongolia today' International magazine for Mongolian railway passengers, Issue #17. p.64-65. 2012]</ref>\n\n== Modern history ==\n\n[[UNESCO]] declared the Mongolian Long Song one of the [[Masterpieces of the Oral and Intangible Heritage of Humanity]] in 2005.\n\nOn April 12, 2013, the ''''''Mongolian Statehood Long Song'''''' was officially exalted at the Mongolian Statehood History Museum located in the State Ceremony Great Hall of the Government House of Mongolia.<ref>[http://www.24tsag.mn/content/30264.shtml News on the exaltation of Mongolian Statehood Long Song at the Statehood History Museum on Mongolian news site.

Pilcher has published several studies of the long song in the region of [[Alxa League]] in [[Inner Mongolia]]. She has observed that the long song today expresses a nostalgia of the past after modernization, and \u201cvisual and zoological metaphors connected to the nomadic lifestyle are not only highly significant to urtyn duu\u2019s song texts, categorization, and singing technique but are also closely related to ornamentation, the achievement of vocal timbre, the singers\u2019 understanding of nomadic herding life, and their feelings of longing and nostalgia as expressed through the music.\u201d<ref>PILCHER, Ojuna W., \u201c\u2018You Can\u2019t Sing\nUrtyn Duu If You Don\u2019t Know How to Ride a Horse\u2019: Urtyn Duu in Alshaa, Inner Mongolia,\u201d ''Asian Music'', 2018, pp. 4\u201333.</ref>\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==Further reading==\n* Bao, Darkhan, and Wuyuntaoli (2007).

Located on the eastern side of the \"Future World\" section of Epcot, the attraction used [[Disney]]'s [[Omnimover]] conveyance system, which took guests past show scenes depicting visions of the future. It is believed to be the sequel to [[Walt Disney]]'s [[Carousel of Progress]], an attraction in [[Tomorrowland]] at [[Walt Disney World]]'s [[Magic Kingdom]]. Horizons was the only attraction in \"Future World\" to showcase all of Epcot's \"Future World\" elements: communication, community interaction, energy, transportation, anatomy, physiology, along with humankind's relationship to the sea, land, air, and space.\n\nThe attraction officially opened on October 1, 1983, as part of Phase II of [[Epcot]]. Horizons originally closed in December 1994, a little more than a year after [[General Electric]] had ended its sponsorship of the attraction. Horizons re-opened in December 1995 due to the closure of two other attractions that were down for refurbishment in \"Future World\", [[Universe of Energy]] and [[World of Motion]]. The attraction permanently closed on January 9, 1999, after which the attraction was dismantled and its structure demolished to make room for [[Mission: Space|Mission: SPACE]], a [[motion simulator]] thrill ride that opened on October 9, 2003.\n\nThe attraction, although extinct, still retains a sizable [[cult following]], especially among Disney park aficionados.<ref name=\"Krosnick\">{{cite web|url=https://www.themeparktourist.com/features/20150607/30334/horizons-depth-look-back-epcots-view-future|title=Horizons: Why Disney Demolished Epcot's Best Ever Attraction|last=Krosnick|first=Brian|date=26 June 2015|publisher=Theme Park Tourist|accessdate=9 April 2018}}</ref>\n\n==Attraction==\n\nHorizons began with a section entitled \"Looking Back at Tomorrow,\" showcasing visions of the future as perceived from the era of [[Jules Verne]] and [[Albert Robida]] through the 1950s. The ride then moved past two immense [[IMAX|OMNIMAX]] screens (groundbreaking technology at the time the ride was built), showing modern technologies and ideas that could be used to build the world of tomorrow. Afterward came the main part of the ride: visions of futuristic life in cities, deserts, undersea, and even in space. The only Disney attraction at the time with multiple endings, Horizons then allowed riders to select which path they wanted to take back to the FuturePort: from the [[space station]] Brava Centauri (depicting [[space colonization]]), from the desert farm of Mesa Verde (depicting [[arid-zone agriculture]]), or from the Sea Castle research base (depicting [[ocean colonization]]).\n\nAs the final part of the ride, guests in their \"[[omnimover]]\" would push a button to select amongst the three choices and would be presented with a 31-second video sequence. A film would then be displayed to riders in each individual car. The videos showed a simulated flyover of an outdoor scene. To create the effect, scale models were built and a camera swept across the futuristic terrain. The models were some of the largest ever created at the time.\n\nThe model for the desert sequence, for example, was {{convert|32|by|75|ft|m}} long. The visual effects were filmed in a hangar at the Burbank airport. Produced in 1983 by 30 model makers, it took over a year to build and shoot the three segments.<ref name=\"kesigndesign.com\">Choose Your Tomorrow model design http://www.kesigndesign.com/code/horizon1.shtml</ref> The exit corridor of the ride originally featured the mural ''The Prologue and the Promise'' by renowned [[space art]]ist [[Robert McCall (artist)|Robert T. McCall]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.mccallstudios.com/renowned/prologue/prologue.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2008-06-07 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080521081144/http://www.mccallstudios.com/renowned/prologue/prologue.html |archivedate=May 21, 2008 |df=mdy-all }}</ref>\n\n==History==\n''Horizons'', in its concept phase, was named '''Century 3''' (or '''Century III'''), to recognize the third century of American existence (1976\u20132076). The name was changed to '''Futureprobe''' to help appeal the attraction toward international guests who wouldn't understand or appreciate ''Century 3''. In the end, the ''Futureprobe'' name was scrapped due to the medical connotation of the word \"[[anal probe|probe]]\". After much debate, GE and Disney officials settled on the name '''Horizons.''' Prior to the start of construction, the project's budget was slashed by $10&nbsp;million (USD). The building size was reduced and the length of the ride was shrunk by 35%, shortening the ride length by {{convert|600|ft|m}}.\n\nHorizons opened exactly one year after Epcot opened and was located between [[World of Motion]] and the [[Universe of Energy]]. The [[Wonders of Life]] pavilion became Horizons' new neighbor in 1989, and World of Motion closed in 1996. Horizons remained operational until World of Motion's successor, [[Test Track]], was ready to open to the public in early 1999.<ref name=\"Orlando Sentinel Horizons\">Company officials say it is likely, but not yet certain, that Horizons will close for good when Test Track opens and will be replaced with a space pavilion. {{Cite news|first= |last= |authorlink= |author=Jill Jorden Spitz |coauthors= |title=ESPN GRILL, COMING TO DISNEY, HOPES CLUB'S POPULARITY RUBS OFF |type=Newspaper |work=|publisher=Orlando Sentinel |location= |id= |pages= |page=9 |date=October 20, 1997 |language= |quote= }}</ref>\n[[File:Horizons (1526231718).jpg|thumb|Horizons glass cased display.]]\n\nIt was proposed that Horizons would be the sequel to the [[Carousel of Progress]] (located in Tomorrowland at Magic Kingdom), Disney's ride from the [[General Electric]] Pavilion at the [[1964 New York World's Fair]]. As the Carousel of Progress followed the changes in lifestyle that faced a family as they lived through the 20th century, Horizons continued their story, showing how they might live in the 21st century. The Carousel's theme song \"[[There's a Great Big Beautiful Tomorrow]]\" was part of the Looking Back at Tomorrow portion of Horizons. The version of \"There's a Great Big Beautiful Tomorrow\" that could be heard in Horizons coming from a television (sung by [[Larry Cedar]]) in the Art Deco scene is the exact version that can still be heard on a radio during the first act of the present [[Carousel of Progress]].\n\nThe original ride concept came from Reginald Jones (then\u2013[[CEO]] of GE) and [[Jack Welch]] (future CEO of GE). The concept was to focus on [[Thomas Edison]] and his body of work along with the origin of General Electric; it was changed to focus on the future of America, a theme that changed yet again to respect that Epcot was to appeal to a global audience. The building which housed Horizons was designed to resemble a [[spacecraft|spaceship]], while accentuating the third dimension and giving the impression of an infinite [[horizon]].\n\n[[GE]] declined to renew sponsorship on September 30, 1993. Ideas were tossed around about the pavilion being turned into a space-themed pavilion. The building would have been upgraded and rethemed. The ride system would be changed drastically, in which the guest would be in an individual space harness while viewing space stations and space in general and would control the pitch and yaw of the vehicle. On January 9, 1999, Horizons closed permanently.\n\nNo reason was publicly given, but the lack of corporate sponsorship, which happened around the same time of the financial disaster of [[Disneyland Paris|Euro Disneyland]] is widely accepted as having played the largest part in the decision. Also widely speculated as a reason for the attraction closing was major structural problems, along with rumored problems with the roof.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.horizons1.com/history.htm|title=Horizons at Epcot Center Timeline|publisher=}}</ref>\n\nThe building stood unoccupied for well over a year as Disney decided between either relaunching the attraction (which would have required a new storyline and major building renovation and upgrades) or demolishing the building and creating a new attraction in its place. It was decided to build a new cutting-edge [[outer space]]-themed attraction, so the Horizons building was slowly torn down in July 2000. The demolition of the building marked the first time in Disney history that an entire ride building had to be demolished in preparation for a new attraction. Construction on [[Mission: SPACE]] began in late 2000 and the new attraction opened in 2003.\n\nVarious props from Horizons have been displayed around Walt Disney World and even in [[Walt Disney Studios Park]] at [[Disneyland Resort Paris]]. A display that features the butler robot animatronic was set up in ''EPCOT: Creating the World of Tomorrow'' for Epcot's 25th anniversary.<ref name=\"Horizons props (Epcot)\">EPCOT: Creating the World of Tomorrow https://www.flickr.com/photos/blm07/1471881269/</ref> At Disney's Hollywood Studios, a few of the props from the underwater city scene are displayed in one of the studio warehouses.<ref name=\"Horizons props (Studios)\">Disney MGM-Studios Backlot Tour: Horizons props https://www.flickr.com/photos/blm07/2112264230/</ref> One of the Desert ships has made its way to Disney's Hollywood Studios, hanging from the ceiling of a restaurant.

[[Amusement park attraction|attraction]] at [[Epcot]] (then known as EPCOT Center), a [[theme park]] at [[Walt Disney World]] in [[Bay Lake, Florida]]. Located on the eastern side of the \"Future World\" section of Epcot, the attraction used [[Disney]]'s [[Omnimover]] conveyance system, which took guests past show scenes depicting visions of the future. It is believed to be the sequel to [[Walt Disney]]'s [[Carousel of Progress]], an attraction in [[Tomorrowland]] at [[Walt Disney World]]'s [[Magic Kingdom]]. Horizons was the only attraction in \"Future World\" to showcase all of Epcot's \"Future World\" elements: communication, community interaction, energy, transportation, anatomy, physiology, along with humankind's relationship to the sea, land, air, and space.\n\nThe attraction officially opened on October 1, 1983, as part of Phase II of [[Epcot]]. Horizons originally closed in December 1994, a little more than a year after [[General Electric]] had ended its sponsorship of the attraction. Horizons re-opened in December 1995 due to the closure of two other attractions that were down for refurbishment in \"Future World\", [[Universe of Energy]] and [[World of Motion]]. The attraction permanently closed on January 9, 1999, after which the attraction was dismantled and its structure demolished to make room for [[Mission: Space|Mission: SPACE]], a [[motion simulator]] thrill ride that opened on October 9, 2003.\n\nThe attraction, although extinct, still retains a sizable [[cult following]], especially among Disney park aficionados.<ref name=\"Krosnick\">{{cite web|url=https://www.themeparktourist.com/features/20150607/30334/horizons-depth-look-back-epcots-view-future|title=Horizons: Why Disney Demolished Epcot's Best Ever Attraction|last=Krosnick|first=Brian|date=26 June 2015|publisher=Theme Park Tourist|accessdate=9 April 2018}}</ref>\n\n==Attraction==\n\nHorizons began with a section entitled \"Looking Back at Tomorrow,\" showcasing visions of the future as perceived from the era of [[Jules Verne]] and [[Albert Robida]] through the 1950s. The ride then moved past two immense [[IMAX|OMNIMAX]] screens (groundbreaking technology at the time the ride was built), showing modern technologies and ideas that could be used to build the world of tomorrow. Afterward came the main part of the ride: visions of futuristic life in cities, deserts, undersea, and even in space. The only Disney attraction at the time with multiple endings, Horizons then allowed riders to select which path they wanted to take back to the FuturePort: from the [[space station]] Brava Centauri (depicting [[space colonization]]), from the desert farm of Mesa Verde (depicting [[arid-zone agriculture]]), or from the Sea Castle research base (depicting [[ocean colonization]]).\n\nAs the final part of the ride, guests in their \"[[omnimover]]\" would push a button to select amongst the three choices and would be presented with a 31-second video sequence. A film would then be displayed to riders in each individual car. The videos showed a simulated flyover of an outdoor scene. To create the effect, scale models were built and a camera swept across the futuristic terrain. The models were some of the largest ever created at the time.\n\nThe model for the desert sequence, for example, was {{convert|32|by|75|ft|m}} long. The visual effects were filmed in a hangar at the Burbank airport. Produced in 1983 by 30 model makers, it took over a year to build and shoot the three segments.<ref name=\"kesigndesign.com\">Choose Your Tomorrow model design http://www.kesigndesign.com/code/horizon1.shtml</ref> The exit corridor of the ride originally featured the mural ''The Prologue and the Promise'' by renowned [[space art]]ist [[Robert McCall (artist)|Robert T. McCall]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.mccallstudios.com/renowned/prologue/prologue.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2008-06-07 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080521081144/http://www.mccallstudios.com/renowned/prologue/prologue.html |archivedate=May 21, 2008 |df=mdy-all }}</ref>\n\n==History==\n''Horizons'', in its concept phase, was named '''Century 3''' (or '''Century III'''), to recognize the third century of American existence (1976\u20132076). The name was changed to '''Futureprobe''' to help appeal the attraction toward international guests who wouldn't understand or appreciate ''Century 3''. In the end, the ''Futureprobe'' name was scrapped due to the medical connotation of the word \"[[anal probe|probe]]\". After much debate, GE and Disney officials settled on the name '''Horizons.''' Prior to the start of construction, the project's budget was slashed by $10&nbsp;million (USD). The building size was reduced and the length of the ride was shrunk by 35%, shortening the ride length by {{convert|600|ft|m}}.\n\nHorizons opened exactly one year after Epcot opened and was located between [[World of Motion]] and the [[Universe of Energy]]. The [[Wonders of Life]] pavilion became Horizons' new neighbor in 1989, and World of Motion closed in 1996. Horizons remained operational until World of Motion's successor, [[Test Track]], was ready to open to the public in early 1999.<ref name=\"Orlando Sentinel Horizons\">Company officials say it is likely, but not yet certain, that Horizons will close for good when Test Track opens and will be replaced with a space pavilion. {{Cite news|first= |last= |authorlink= |author=Jill Jorden Spitz |coauthors= |title=ESPN GRILL, COMING TO DISNEY, HOPES CLUB'S POPULARITY RUBS OFF |type=Newspaper |work=|publisher=Orlando Sentinel |location= |id= |pages= |page=9 |date=October 20, 1997 |language= |quote= }}</ref>\n[[File:Horizons (1526231718).jpg|thumb|Horizons glass cased display.]]\n\nIt was proposed that Horizons would be the sequel to the [[Carousel of Progress]] (located in Tomorrowland at Magic Kingdom), Disney's ride from the [[General Electric]] Pavilion at the [[1964 New York World's Fair]]. As the Carousel of Progress followed the changes in lifestyle that faced a family as they lived through the 20th century, Horizons continued their story, showing how they might live in the 21st century. The Carousel's theme song \"[[There's a Great Big Beautiful Tomorrow]]\" was part of the Looking Back at Tomorrow portion of Horizons. The version of \"There's a Great Big Beautiful Tomorrow\" that could be heard in Horizons coming from a television (sung by [[Larry Cedar]]) in the Art Deco scene is the exact version that can still be heard on a radio during the first act of the present [[Carousel of Progress]].\n\nThe original ride concept came from Reginald Jones (then\u2013[[CEO]] of GE) and [[Jack Welch]] (future CEO of GE). The concept was to focus on [[Thomas Edison]] and his body of work along with the origin of General Electric; it was changed to focus on the future of America, a theme that changed yet again to respect that Epcot was to appeal to a global audience. The building which housed Horizons was designed to resemble a [[spacecraft|spaceship]], while accentuating the third dimension and giving the impression of an infinite [[horizon]].\n\n[[GE]] declined to renew sponsorship on September 30, 1993. Ideas were tossed around about the pavilion being turned into a space-themed pavilion. The building would have been upgraded and rethemed. The ride system would be changed drastically, in which the guest would be in an individual space harness while viewing space stations and space in general and would control the pitch and yaw of the vehicle. On January 9, 1999, Horizons closed permanently.\n\nNo reason was publicly given, but the lack of corporate sponsorship, which happened around the same time of the financial disaster of [[Disneyland Paris|Euro Disneyland]] is widely accepted as having played the largest part in the decision. Also widely speculated as a reason for the attraction closing was major structural problems, along with rumored problems with the roof.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.horizons1.com/history.htm|title=Horizons at Epcot Center Timeline|publisher=}}</ref>\n\nThe building stood unoccupied for well over a year as Disney decided between either relaunching the attraction (which would have required a new storyline and major building renovation and upgrades) or demolishing the building and creating a new attraction in its place. It was decided to build a new cutting-edge [[outer space]]-themed attraction, so the Horizons building was slowly torn down in July 2000. The demolition of the building marked the first time in Disney history that an entire ride building had to be demolished in preparation for a new attraction. Construction on [[Mission: SPACE]] began in late 2000 and the new attraction opened in 2003.\n\nVarious props from Horizons have been displayed around Walt Disney World and even in [[Walt Disney Studios Park]] at [[Disneyland Resort Paris]]. A display that features the butler robot animatronic was set up in ''EPCOT: Creating the World of Tomorrow'' for Epcot's 25th anniversary.<ref name=\"Horizons props (Epcot)\">EPCOT: Creating the World of Tomorrow https://www.flickr.com/photos/blm07/1471881269/</ref> At Disney's Hollywood Studios, a few of the props from the underwater city scene are displayed in one of the studio warehouses.<ref name=\"Horizons props (Studios)\">Disney MGM-Studios Backlot Tour: Horizons props https://www.flickr.com/photos/blm07/2112264230/</ref> One of the Desert ships has made its way to Disney's Hollywood Studios, hanging from the ceiling of a restaurant.
