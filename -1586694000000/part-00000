It has traditionally been associated with strong advocacy of [[human rights]], [[anti-communism]], and a distinct [[Taiwanese identity]]. The incumbent President and former leader of the DPP, [[Tsai Ing-wen]], is the second member of the DPP to hold the office.<ref name=\"chinapost.com.tw\">[http://www.chinapost.com.tw/taiwan/national/presidential-election/2012/01/14/329044/Tsai-steps.htm \"Tsai steps down as DPP chair after defeat in presidential poll\"] (14 January 2012). ''The China Post''. Retrieved 6 April 2018.</ref>\n\nThe DPP is a long-term member of [[Liberal International]] and a founding member of the [[Council of Asian Liberals and Democrats]]. It represented Taiwan in the [[Unrepresented Nations and Peoples Organisation]]. The DPP and its affiliated parties are widely classified as [[socially liberal]] because of their strong support for human rights, including support for [[gender equality]], but they also advocate [[economic liberalism]] and a [[Taiwanese nationalism|Taiwanese national identity]]. In addition, the DPP is more willing to increase military expenditures, with foreign policy on closer ties with the United States and Japan.\n\n==History==\nThe DPP's roots were in opposition to the [[Kuomintang]]'s [[One-party state|one-party]] [[Authoritarianism|authoritarian rule]]. It was founded as the [[Tangwai]] \u2013 or \"outside-the-KMT\" \u2013 movement. This movement culminated in the formation of the DPP as an alternative party on 28 September 1986 when eighteen founding members met at [[Grand Hotel (Taipei)|Grand Hotel Taipei]].<ref>{{cite news|last1=Lu|first1=Lu Hsin-hui|last2=Kuo|first2=Chung-han|title=DPP should clarify its cross-strait policy: founding member|url=http://focustaiwan.tw/news/aipl/201609280026.aspx|accessdate=29 September 2016|agency=Central News Agency|date=28 September 2016}}</ref> A total of 132 people joined the party that day.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Chung|first1=Li-hua|last2=Chin|first2=Jonathan|title=DPP members say party must discuss core values|url=http://www.taipeitimes.com/News/taiwan/archives/2016/09/30/2003656223|accessdate=30 September 2016|work=Taipei Times|date=30 September 2016}}</ref> The new party contested the [[1986 Taiwan legislative election|1986 election]] as \"nonpartisan\" when competing parties remained illegal under national law until the following year. The first members of the party drew heavily from the ranks of family members and defense lawyers of political prisoners as well as intellectuals and artists who had spent time abroad. Such individuals were strongly committed to political change that would ensure constitutional support in Republic of China's freedoms of speech, press, assembly, and association. The party did not at the outset give open support to an independent Republic of China's national identity \u2013 a move that could have invited a violent crackdown by the Republic of China's Kuomintang rulers. Its platform was pro-environment and pro-democracy. \n\nAs more and more of its demands were met during the 1990s \u2013 such as the [[direct popular election]] of Republic of China's [[President of the Republic of China|president]] and all representatives in its [[National Assembly of the Republic of China|National Assembly]] and [[Legislative Yuan]], and open discussion of Republic of China's repressive past as represented in the [[February 28 Incident]] and its long [[martial law]] aftermath \u2013 a greater variety of views could be advocated in the more liberal political atmosphere. Since 1991, party members began openly promoting a national identity for Taiwan separate from China. The DPP doctrine adopted to reform of the [[Constitution of the Republic of China|Constitution]] to change the name of Republic of China to \"Republic of Taiwan\", though the DPP have no aim to amend the Constitution through a referendum. In fact, it is part of the DPP's Taiwanese nationalist ideology.\n\nOnce the DPP had representation in the [[Legislative Yuan]] (LY, or Parliament), the party used the legislature as a forum to challenge the government. However, it did not emerge as a formidable force until 1991, when the elderly LY members elected from [[mainland China]] provinces in 1948 retired. As the major opposition in the LY, the DPP worked with then-President [[Lee Teng-hui]], the then-leader of KMT, to push through a series of amendments to transfer into a [[semi-presidential system]] (for example, Republic of China's [[premier of the Republic of China|premier]] would no longer have to be confirmed by the LY). Among the electoral reforms, a [[party-list proportional representation|PR list]] was adopted and aboriginal seats in the LY created.\n\n===2000\u20132008: in minority government===\n[[File:Chen Shui-bian from VOA.jpg|thumb|right|Former President Chen Shui-bian, the first DPP [[President of the Republic of China|President]] (2000-2008)]]\n[[File:DPP-Taiwan-old.svg|thumb|right|Old DPP logo]]\nThe DPP won the presidency with the [[2000 Taiwan presidential election|election]] of [[Chen Shui-bian]] in March 2000 with a plurality, due to [[Pan-Blue]] voters splitting their vote between the Kuomintang and independent candidate [[James Soong]], ending 91 years of KMT rule in the Republic of China. Chen softened the party's stance on independence to appeal to moderate voters, appease the United States, and placate China. He also promised not to [[Four Noes and One Without|change the ROC state symbols or declare formal independence]] as long as the [[China|People's Republic of China]] did not attack Taiwan.\n\nThe DPP became the largest party having reached a plurality in the Legislative Yuan for the first time in 2002 following the [[2001 Taiwan legislative election|2001 legislative election]]. However, a majority coalition between the KMT, [[People First Party (Republic of China)|People First Party]], and [[New Party (Republic of China)|New Party]] prevented it from taking control of the chamber.\n\nIn 2004, [[President of the Republic of China|President]] Chen Shui-bian was re-elected by a narrow margin. He and Vice President [[Annette Lu]] had been involved in an assassination attempt only hours before the [[2004 Taiwan presidential election|election]]. The KMT candidate, [[Lien Chan]], demanded a recount the following morning. A judicial recount under the jurisdiction of a special panel of the High Court began on 10 May 2004 and ended on 18 May 2004. It was conducted by about 460 teams situated in 21 courthouses across the Taiwan area. Each team had seven members \u2013 one judge, two members each from the district court and the local government election authorities and two witnesses each representing the plaintiff ([[Pan-Blue Coalition]]) and the defendant ([[Pan-Green Coalition]]). Disputed votes were sent to High Court in Taipei for verification. After the recount, President Chen was confirmed the winner of the election by a smaller margin (25,563 as opposed to 29,518 originally). In the [[2004 Taiwan legislative election|later legislative election]], the Pan-Blue Coalition opposition retained control of the chamber.\n\nThe DPP suffered a significant election defeat in nationwide [[2005 Taiwanese local elections|local and county elections in December 2005]]. The pan-blue coalition captured 16 of 23 county and city government offices under the leadership of popular [[Taipei]] mayor and KMT Party Chairman [[Ma Ying-jeou]].\n\nThe results led to a shake up of the party leadership. [[Su Tseng-chang]] resigned as DPP chairman soon after election results were announced. Su had pledged to step down if the DPP lost either Taipei County or failed to win 10 of the 23 mayor/magistrate positions. Vice President [[Annette Lu]] was appointed acting DPP leader. Presidential Office Secretary-General [[Yu Shyi-kun]] was elected in a [[2006 Democratic Progressive Party chairmanship election|three-way race]] against legislator [[Chai Trong-rong]] and [[Wong Chin-chu]] with 54.4% of the vote.\n\nPremier [[Frank Hsieh]], DPP election organizer and former mayor of [[Kaohsiung]] twice tendered a verbal resignation immediately following the election, but his resignation was not accepted by President Chen until 17 January 2006 after the DPP chairmanship election had concluded. The former DPP Chairman Su Tseng-chang was appointed to replace Hsieh as premier. Hsieh and his cabinet resigned en masse on January 24 to make way for Su and his new cabinet. President Chen had offered the position of Presidential Office Secretary-General (vacated by Su) to the departing premier, but Hsieh declined and left office criticizing President Chen for his tough line on dealing with China.\n\n====Separate identity====\nOn 30 September 2007, the DPP approved a [[Resolution (law)|resolution]] asserting a separate identity from China and called for the enactment of a new constitution for a \"normal nation\". It struck an accommodating tone by advocating general use of \"[[Taiwan]]\" as the country's name without calling for abandonment of the name Republic of China.<ref>[http://usatoday30.usatoday.com/news/world/2007-09-30-taiwan_N.htm AP, Republic of China Party Asserts Separate Identity]</ref>\n\n[[File:\u8521\u82f1\u6587\u5b98\u65b9\u5143\u9996\u8096\u50cf\u7167.png|thumb|right|250px|[[Tsai Ing-wen]], the second DPP [[President of the Republic of China|President]] (2016-present) and the leader of the DPP since 2008, she is the first female leader of the DPP.]]\n===2008\u20132016: back to opposition===\nIn the national elections held in early months of 2008, the DPP won less than 25% of the seats (38.2% vote share) in the new Legislative Yuan while its presidential candidate, former [[Kaohsiung]] mayor [[Frank Hsieh]], lost to KMT candidate [[Ma Ying-jeou]] by a wide margin (41.55% vs. 58.45%). In May, the DPP elected [[Tsai Ing-wen]] as the new leader, Tsai became the first female leader of the DPP and the first female leader to lead a major party in Taiwan.\n\nThe first months since backed to the opposition were dominated by press coverage of the travails of [[Chen Shui-bian]] and his wife [[Wu Shu-jen]]. On 15 August 2008, Chen resigned from the DPP and apologized: \"Today I have to say sorry to all of the DPP members and supporters. I let everyone down, caused you humiliation and failed to meet your expectations. My acts have caused irreparable damage to the party. I love the DPP deeply and am proud of being a DPP member. To express my deepest regrets to all DPP members and supporters, I announce my withdrawal from the DPP immediately. My wife Wu Shu-jen is also withdrawing from the party.\" DPP Chairperson followed with a public statement on behalf of the party: \"In regard to Chen and his wife's decision to withdraw from the party and his desire to shoulder responsibility for his actions as well as to undergo an investigation by the party's anti-corruption committee, we respect his decision and accept it.\"<ref>[http://www.pacificmagazine.net/news/2008/08/17/former-taiwan-president-resigns-from-party-over-corruption-charges pacificmagazine.net, Former Republic of China President Resigns From Party Over Corruption Charges]{{dead link|date=December 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref>\n\nThe DPP vowed to reflect on public misgivings towards the party.

Furthermore, its platform includes a legal and political order based on human rights and democracy; balanced economic and financial administration; fair and open social welfare; educational and cultural reform; and, independent defence and peaceful foreign policy with closer ties to United States and Japan. For these reasons, it used to be considered a party of the [[center-left]] economically though its base consisted largely of the [[middle class]]. The party also has a [[social liberal]] stance that includes support for [[gender equality]] and [[LGBT rights in Taiwan|LGBT rights]] (the party have supported [[Same-sex marriage in Taiwan|same-sex marriage]] under Tsai's leadership), and also have a strong [[social conservative]] base, including support from the [[Presbyterian Church in Taiwan]]. Since the democratisation of Taiwan in the 1990s, the DPP has had its strongest performance in the [[Hokkien]]-speaking counties and cities of Taiwan, compared with the predominantly [[Hakka]] and [[Mandarin Chinese|Mandarin]]-speaking counties, that tend to support the [[Kuomintang]].\n\nThe primary political axis in Taiwan involves the issue of [[Taiwan independence]] versus eventual [[Cross-Strait Unification|unification with China]]. Although the differences tend to be portrayed in polarized terms, both major coalitions have developed modified, nuanced and often complex positions. Though opposed in the philosophical origins, the practical differences between such positions can sometimes be subtle.\n\nThe current official position of the party is that Taiwan is an independent and sovereign country whose territory consists of Taiwan and its surrounding smaller islands and whose sovereignty derives only from the ROC citizens living in Taiwan (similar philosophy of [[self-determination]]), based on the \"[[Resolution on Taiwan's Future]]\" in 1999. It considers Taiwan as an independent nation under the name of Republic of China, making a formal declaration of independence unnecessary. The DPP rejects the so-called \"[[One China principle]]\" defined in 1992 as the basis for official diplomatic relations with the PRC and advocates a Taiwanese national identity which is separate from mainland China. The DPP argues that its efforts to promote a Taiwanese national identity are merely an effort to normalize a Taiwanese identity repressed during years of authoritarian Kuomintang rule. The DPP also differs from the KMT on foreign and defense policies in that the DPP considers relations with the United States, Japan, and European states, among other democratic countries, crucial for Taiwan's security.\n\nIn contrast, the KMT or pan-blue coalition agrees that the Republic of China is an independent and sovereign country that is not part of the PRC, but argues that a one China principle (with different definitions across the strait) can be used as the basis for talks with China. The KMT also opposes the purposes of Taiwan independence and argues that efforts to establish a Taiwanese national identity separated from the Chinese national identity are unnecessary and needlessly provocative. Some KMT conservative officials have called efforts from DPP \"[[anti-China]]\" (opposing migrants from mainland China, whom DPP officials did not recognize as Taiwanese, but Chinese). At the other end of the political spectrum, the acceptance by the DPP of the symbols of the Republic of China is opposed by the [[Taiwan Solidarity Union]].\n\nThe first years of the DPP as the ruling party drew accusations from the opposition that, as a self-styled Taiwanese [[nationalism|nationalist]] party, the DPP was itself inadequately sensitive to the ethnographic diversity of Taiwan's population. Where the KMT had been guilty of Chinese [[chauvinism]], the critics charged, the DPP might offer nothing more as a remedy than [[Hoklo people|Hoklo]] chauvinism.\n\nChina has maintained a hostile position toward the DPP. It has made some efforts to moderate its tone since passing its [[Anti-Secession Law]] in 2005 to prevent a popular backlash from Taiwan's voters. In 2008, China stated it was willing to negotiate with any party in Taiwan that \"accepts the so-called [[1992 consensus]]\" (the consensus agreed by the KMT and the Communist Party of China).

It has traditionally been associated with strong advocacy of [[human rights]], [[anti-communism]], and a distinct [[Taiwanese identity]].

It represented Taiwan in the [[Unrepresented Nations and Peoples Organisation]]. The DPP and its affiliated parties are widely classified as [[socially liberal]] because of their strong support for human rights, including support for [[gender equality]], but they also advocate [[economic liberalism]] and a [[Taiwanese nationalism|Taiwanese national identity]]. In addition, the DPP is more willing to increase military expenditures, with foreign policy on closer ties with the United States and Japan.\n\n==History==\nThe DPP's roots were in opposition to the [[Kuomintang]]'s [[One-party state|one-party]] [[Authoritarianism|authoritarian rule]]. It was founded as the [[Tangwai]] \u2013 or \"outside-the-KMT\" \u2013 movement. This movement culminated in the formation of the DPP as an alternative party on 28 September 1986 when eighteen founding members met at [[Grand Hotel (Taipei)|Grand Hotel Taipei]].<ref>{{cite news|last1=Lu|first1=Lu Hsin-hui|last2=Kuo|first2=Chung-han|title=DPP should clarify its cross-strait policy: founding member|url=http://focustaiwan.tw/news/aipl/201609280026.aspx|accessdate=29 September 2016|agency=Central News Agency|date=28 September 2016}}</ref> A total of 132 people joined the party that day.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Chung|first1=Li-hua|last2=Chin|first2=Jonathan|title=DPP members say party must discuss core values|url=http://www.taipeitimes.com/News/taiwan/archives/2016/09/30/2003656223|accessdate=30 September 2016|work=Taipei Times|date=30 September 2016}}</ref> The new party contested the [[1986 Taiwan legislative election|1986 election]] as \"nonpartisan\" when competing parties remained illegal under national law until the following year. The first members of the party drew heavily from the ranks of family members and defense lawyers of political prisoners as well as intellectuals and artists who had spent time abroad. Such individuals were strongly committed to political change that would ensure constitutional support in Republic of China's freedoms of speech, press, assembly, and association. The party did not at the outset give open support to an independent Republic of China's national identity \u2013 a move that could have invited a violent crackdown by the Republic of China's Kuomintang rulers. Its platform was pro-environment and pro-democracy. \n\nAs more and more of its demands were met during the 1990s \u2013 such as the [[direct popular election]] of Republic of China's [[President of the Republic of China|president]] and all representatives in its [[National Assembly of the Republic of China|National Assembly]] and [[Legislative Yuan]], and open discussion of Republic of China's repressive past as represented in the [[February 28 Incident]] and its long [[martial law]] aftermath \u2013 a greater variety of views could be advocated in the more liberal political atmosphere. Since 1991, party members began openly promoting a national identity for Taiwan separate from China. The DPP doctrine adopted to reform of the [[Constitution of the Republic of China|Constitution]] to change the name of Republic of China to \"Republic of Taiwan\", though the DPP have no aim to amend the Constitution through a referendum. In fact, it is part of the DPP's Taiwanese nationalist ideology.\n\nOnce the DPP had representation in the [[Legislative Yuan]] (LY, or Parliament), the party used the legislature as a forum to challenge the government. However, it did not emerge as a formidable force until 1991, when the elderly LY members elected from [[mainland China]] provinces in 1948 retired. As the major opposition in the LY, the DPP worked with then-President [[Lee Teng-hui]], the then-leader of KMT, to push through a series of amendments to transfer into a [[semi-presidential system]] (for example, Republic of China's [[premier of the Republic of China|premier]] would no longer have to be confirmed by the LY). Among the electoral reforms, a [[party-list proportional representation|PR list]] was adopted and aboriginal seats in the LY created.\n\n===2000\u20132008: in minority government===\n[[File:Chen Shui-bian from VOA.jpg|thumb|right|Former President Chen Shui-bian, the first DPP [[President of the Republic of China|President]] (2000-2008)]]\n[[File:DPP-Taiwan-old.svg|thumb|right|Old DPP logo]]\nThe DPP won the presidency with the [[2000 Taiwan presidential election|election]] of [[Chen Shui-bian]] in March 2000 with a plurality, due to [[Pan-Blue]] voters splitting their vote between the Kuomintang and independent candidate [[James Soong]], ending 91 years of KMT rule in the Republic of China. Chen softened the party's stance on independence to appeal to moderate voters, appease the United States, and placate China. He also promised not to [[Four Noes and One Without|change the ROC state symbols or declare formal independence]] as long as the [[China|People's Republic of China]] did not attack Taiwan.\n\nThe DPP became the largest party having reached a plurality in the Legislative Yuan for the first time in 2002 following the [[2001 Taiwan legislative election|2001 legislative election]]. However, a majority coalition between the KMT, [[People First Party (Republic of China)|People First Party]], and [[New Party (Republic of China)|New Party]] prevented it from taking control of the chamber.\n\nIn 2004, [[President of the Republic of China|President]] Chen Shui-bian was re-elected by a narrow margin. He and Vice President [[Annette Lu]] had been involved in an assassination attempt only hours before the [[2004 Taiwan presidential election|election]]. The KMT candidate, [[Lien Chan]], demanded a recount the following morning. A judicial recount under the jurisdiction of a special panel of the High Court began on 10 May 2004 and ended on 18 May 2004. It was conducted by about 460 teams situated in 21 courthouses across the Taiwan area. Each team had seven members \u2013 one judge, two members each from the district court and the local government election authorities and two witnesses each representing the plaintiff ([[Pan-Blue Coalition]]) and the defendant ([[Pan-Green Coalition]]). Disputed votes were sent to High Court in Taipei for verification. After the recount, President Chen was confirmed the winner of the election by a smaller margin (25,563 as opposed to 29,518 originally). In the [[2004 Taiwan legislative election|later legislative election]], the Pan-Blue Coalition opposition retained control of the chamber.\n\nThe DPP suffered a significant election defeat in nationwide [[2005 Taiwanese local elections|local and county elections in December 2005]]. The pan-blue coalition captured 16 of 23 county and city government offices under the leadership of popular [[Taipei]] mayor and KMT Party Chairman [[Ma Ying-jeou]].\n\nThe results led to a shake up of the party leadership. [[Su Tseng-chang]] resigned as DPP chairman soon after election results were announced. Su had pledged to step down if the DPP lost either Taipei County or failed to win 10 of the 23 mayor/magistrate positions. Vice President [[Annette Lu]] was appointed acting DPP leader. Presidential Office Secretary-General [[Yu Shyi-kun]] was elected in a [[2006 Democratic Progressive Party chairmanship election|three-way race]] against legislator [[Chai Trong-rong]] and [[Wong Chin-chu]] with 54.4% of the vote.\n\nPremier [[Frank Hsieh]], DPP election organizer and former mayor of [[Kaohsiung]] twice tendered a verbal resignation immediately following the election, but his resignation was not accepted by President Chen until 17 January 2006 after the DPP chairmanship election had concluded. The former DPP Chairman Su Tseng-chang was appointed to replace Hsieh as premier. Hsieh and his cabinet resigned en masse on January 24 to make way for Su and his new cabinet. President Chen had offered the position of Presidential Office Secretary-General (vacated by Su) to the departing premier, but Hsieh declined and left office criticizing President Chen for his tough line on dealing with China.\n\n====Separate identity====\nOn 30 September 2007, the DPP approved a [[Resolution (law)|resolution]] asserting a separate identity from China and called for the enactment of a new constitution for a \"normal nation\". It struck an accommodating tone by advocating general use of \"[[Taiwan]]\" as the country's name without calling for abandonment of the name Republic of China.<ref>[http://usatoday30.usatoday.com/news/world/2007-09-30-taiwan_N.htm AP, Republic of China Party Asserts Separate Identity]</ref>\n\n[[File:\u8521\u82f1\u6587\u5b98\u65b9\u5143\u9996\u8096\u50cf\u7167.png|thumb|right|250px|[[Tsai Ing-wen]], the second DPP [[President of the Republic of China|President]] (2016-present) and the leader of the DPP since 2008, she is the first female leader of the DPP.]]\n===2008\u20132016: back to opposition===\nIn the national elections held in early months of 2008, the DPP won less than 25% of the seats (38.2% vote share) in the new Legislative Yuan while its presidential candidate, former [[Kaohsiung]] mayor [[Frank Hsieh]], lost to KMT candidate [[Ma Ying-jeou]] by a wide margin (41.55% vs. 58.45%). In May, the DPP elected [[Tsai Ing-wen]] as the new leader, Tsai became the first female leader of the DPP and the first female leader to lead a major party in Taiwan.\n\nThe first months since backed to the opposition were dominated by press coverage of the travails of [[Chen Shui-bian]] and his wife [[Wu Shu-jen]]. On 15 August 2008, Chen resigned from the DPP and apologized: \"Today I have to say sorry to all of the DPP members and supporters. I let everyone down, caused you humiliation and failed to meet your expectations. My acts have caused irreparable damage to the party. I love the DPP deeply and am proud of being a DPP member. To express my deepest regrets to all DPP members and supporters, I announce my withdrawal from the DPP immediately. My wife Wu Shu-jen is also withdrawing from the party.\" DPP Chairperson followed with a public statement on behalf of the party: \"In regard to Chen and his wife's decision to withdraw from the party and his desire to shoulder responsibility for his actions as well as to undergo an investigation by the party's anti-corruption committee, we respect his decision and accept it.\"<ref>[http://www.pacificmagazine.net/news/2008/08/17/former-taiwan-president-resigns-from-party-over-corruption-charges pacificmagazine.net, Former Republic of China President Resigns From Party Over Corruption Charges]{{dead link|date=December 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref>\n\nThe DPP vowed to reflect on public misgivings towards the party.

Furthermore, its platform includes a legal and political order based on human rights and democracy; balanced economic and financial administration; fair and open social welfare; educational and cultural reform; and, independent defence and peaceful foreign policy with closer ties to United States and Japan. For these reasons, it used to be considered a party of the [[center-left]] economically though its base consisted largely of the [[middle class]]. The party also has a [[social liberal]] stance that includes support for [[gender equality]] and [[LGBT rights in Taiwan|LGBT rights]] (the party have supported [[Same-sex marriage in Taiwan|same-sex marriage]] under Tsai's leadership), and also have a strong [[social conservative]] base, including support from the [[Presbyterian Church in Taiwan]]. Since the democratisation of Taiwan in the 1990s, the DPP has had its strongest performance in the [[Hokkien]]-speaking counties and cities of Taiwan, compared with the predominantly [[Hakka]] and [[Mandarin Chinese|Mandarin]]-speaking counties, that tend to support the [[Kuomintang]].\n\nThe primary political axis in Taiwan involves the issue of [[Taiwan independence]] versus eventual [[Cross-Strait Unification|unification with China]]. Although the differences tend to be portrayed in polarized terms, both major coalitions have developed modified, nuanced and often complex positions. Though opposed in the philosophical origins, the practical differences between such positions can sometimes be subtle.\n\nThe current official position of the party is that Taiwan is an independent and sovereign country whose territory consists of Taiwan and its surrounding smaller islands and whose sovereignty derives only from the ROC citizens living in Taiwan (similar philosophy of [[self-determination]]), based on the \"[[Resolution on Taiwan's Future]]\" in 1999. It considers Taiwan as an independent nation under the name of Republic of China, making a formal declaration of independence unnecessary. The DPP rejects the so-called \"[[One China principle]]\" defined in 1992 as the basis for official diplomatic relations with the PRC and advocates a Taiwanese national identity which is separate from mainland China. The DPP argues that its efforts to promote a Taiwanese national identity are merely an effort to normalize a Taiwanese identity repressed during years of authoritarian Kuomintang rule. The DPP also differs from the KMT on foreign and defense policies in that the DPP considers relations with the United States, Japan, and European states, among other democratic countries, crucial for Taiwan's security.\n\nIn contrast, the KMT or pan-blue coalition agrees that the Republic of China is an independent and sovereign country that is not part of the PRC, but argues that a one China principle (with different definitions across the strait) can be used as the basis for talks with China. The KMT also opposes the purposes of Taiwan independence and argues that efforts to establish a Taiwanese national identity separated from the Chinese national identity are unnecessary and needlessly provocative. Some KMT conservative officials have called efforts from DPP \"[[anti-China]]\" (opposing migrants from mainland China, whom DPP officials did not recognize as Taiwanese, but Chinese). At the other end of the political spectrum, the acceptance by the DPP of the symbols of the Republic of China is opposed by the [[Taiwan Solidarity Union]].\n\nThe first years of the DPP as the ruling party drew accusations from the opposition that, as a self-styled Taiwanese [[nationalism|nationalist]] party, the DPP was itself inadequately sensitive to the ethnographic diversity of Taiwan's population. Where the KMT had been guilty of Chinese [[chauvinism]], the critics charged, the DPP might offer nothing more as a remedy than [[Hoklo people|Hoklo]] chauvinism.\n\nChina has maintained a hostile position toward the DPP. It has made some efforts to moderate its tone since passing its [[Anti-Secession Law]] in 2005 to prevent a popular backlash from Taiwan's voters. In 2008, China stated it was willing to negotiate with any party in Taiwan that \"accepts the so-called [[1992 consensus]]\" (the consensus agreed by the KMT and the Communist Party of China). The DPP denies the existence of the 1992 consensus between China and Taiwan and demands a greater democratic opening in China.\n\nThe deep-rooted hostility between [[Taiwanese aborigines]] and (Taiwanese) Hoklo, and the aboriginal communities effective KMT networks contribute to aboriginal skepticism against the DPP and the aboriginals tendency to vote for the KMT.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Damm|first1=Jens|editor1-last=Damm|editor1-first=Jens|editor2-last=Lim|editor2-first=Paul|title=European perspectives on Taiwan|date=2012|publisher=Springer VS|location=Wiesbaden|isbn=9783531943039|page=95|chapter=Multiculturalism in Taiwan and the Influence of Europe}}</ref> Aboriginals have criticized politicians for abusing the \"indigenization\" movement for political gains, such as aboriginal opposition to the DPP's \"rectification\" by recognizing the Truku for political reasons, where the Atayal and Seediq slammed the Truku for their name rectification.<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=0t_CU9gmi8cC&pg=PA220&dq=truku&hl=en&sa=X&ei=P0QfVbq1MomWsAXRt4SADA&ved=0CD4Q6AEwBg#v=onepage&q=truku&f=false ed.

In his 1555 work ''History of the Northern Peoples'', Magnus gives the following description of a Norwegian sea serpent:\n\n<blockquote>Those who sail up along the coast of Norway to trade or to fish, all tell the remarkable story of how a serpent of fearsome size, 200 feet long and 20 feet wide, resides in rifts and caves outside [[Bergen, Norway|Bergen]]. On bright summer nights this serpent leaves the caves to eat calves, lambs and pigs, or it fares out to the sea and feeds on sea nettles, crabs and similar marine animals.

He reports the following: \"As for the plains, the first, beginning at the sea, is called Macras, or Macra-Plain. Here, as reported by Poseidonius, was seen the fallen dragon, the corpse of which was about a plethrum [100 feet] in length, and so bulky that horsemen standing by it on either side could not see one another; and its jaws were large enough to admit a man on horseback, and each flake of its horny scales exceeded an oblong shield in length.\"(Geography, book 16, chapter two, paragraph 17) The creature was seen by Poseidonius, a Philosopher, sometime between 130 and 51 BC.\n\n[[Hans Egede]], the national [[saint]] of Greenland, gives an 18th-century description of a sea serpent. On July 6, 1734 his ship sailed past the coast of Greenland when suddenly those on board \"saw a most terrible creature, resembling nothing they saw before. The monster lifted its head so high that it seemed to be higher than the [[crow's nest]] on the [[mainmast]]. The head was small and the body short and wrinkled. The unknown creature was using giant fins which propelled it through the water. Later the sailors saw its tail as well. The monster was longer than our whole ship\", wrote Egede.

In the [[Aeneid]], a pair of sea serpents killed [[Laoco\u00f6n]] and his sons when Laoco\u00f6n argued against bringing the [[Trojan Horse]] into Troy.\n\nIn antiquity and in the Bible, dragons were envisioned as huge serpentine monsters, which means that the image of a dragon with two or four legs and wings came much later during the [[Late Middle Ages]]. Stories depicting sea-dwelling serpents may include the Babylonian myths of Tiamat, the myths of the Hydra, Scylla, Cetus and Echidna in the Greek mythology, and even the Leviathan.\n\nIn [[Norse mythology]], ''[[J\u00f6rmungandr]]'' (or ''[[Midgar\u00f0sormr]]'') was a sea serpent so long that it encircled the entire world, [[Midgard]].

He reports the following: \"As for the plains, the first, beginning at the sea, is called Macras, or Macra-Plain. Here, as reported by Poseidonius, was seen the fallen dragon, the corpse of which was about a plethrum [100 feet] in length, and so bulky that horsemen standing by it on either side could not see one another; and its jaws were large enough to admit a man on horseback, and each flake of its horny scales exceeded an oblong shield in length.\"(Geography, book 16, chapter two, paragraph 17) The creature was seen by Poseidonius, a Philosopher, sometime between 130 and 51 BC.\n\n[[Hans Egede]], the national [[saint]] of Greenland, gives an 18th-century description of a sea serpent. On July 6, 1734 his ship sailed past the coast of Greenland when suddenly those on board \"saw a most terrible creature, resembling nothing they saw before. The monster lifted its head so high that it seemed to be higher than the [[crow's nest]] on the [[mainmast]]. The head was small and the body short and wrinkled. The unknown creature was using giant fins which propelled it through the water. Later the sailors saw its tail as well. The monster was longer than our whole ship\", wrote Egede.

It does not include the power to take and transfer ownership of private property from one property owner to another private property owner without a valid public purpose.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Encyclopedia of the City|last=Caves|first=R. W.|publisher=Routledge|year=2004|isbn=|location=|pages=216}}</ref> However, this power can be legislatively delegated by the state to municipalities, government subdivisions, or even to private persons or corporations, when they are authorized by the legislature to exercise the functions of public character.<ref>{{cite web|title=Eminent Domain|url=http://legal-dictionary.thefreedictionary.com/eminent+domain|website=The Free Dictionary|publisher=Farlex, Inc.|accessdate=26 July 2017}}</ref>\n\nIn the Anglo-American historical context, property taken could be used only by the government taking the property in question. The most common uses of property taken by eminent domain have been for roads, government buildings and [[public utility|public utilities]]. However, in the mid-20th century, a new application of eminent domain was pioneered, in which the government could take the property and transfer it to a private third party. This was initially done only to a property that has been deemed \"blighted\" or a \"development impediment\", on the principle that such properties had a negative impact upon surrounding property owners, but was later expanded to allow the taking of any private property when the new third-party owner could develop the property in such a way as to bring in increased tax revenues to the government.\n\nSome jurisdictions require that the taker make an offer to purchase the subject property, before resorting to the use of eminent domain. However, once the property is taken and the judgment is final, the condemnor owns it in [[fee simple]], and may put it to uses other than those specified in the eminent domain action.\n\nTakings may be of the subject property in its entirety (total take) or in part (part take), either quantitatively or qualitatively (either partially in fee simple or, commonly, an easement, or any other interest less than the full fee simple title).\n\n==Meaning==\nThe term \"eminent domain\" was taken from the legal treatise ''[[De jure belli ac pacis]]'' (On the Law of War and Peace), written by the [[Netherlands|Dutch]] [[jurist]] [[Hugo Grotius]] in 1625,<ref>{{cite book |first=John E. |last=Nowak |first2=Ronald D. |last2=Rotunda |title=Constitutional Law |publisher=Thomson West |location=St. Paul, MN |year=2004 |page=263 |edition=Seventh |isbn=0-314-14452-8}}</ref> which used the term ''dominium eminens'' ([[Latin]] for ''supreme lordship'') and described the power as follows:\n<blockquote>...&nbsp; The property of subjects is under the eminent domain of the state, so that the state or those who act for it may use and even alienate and destroy such property, not only in the case of extreme necessity, in which even private persons have a right over the property of others, but for ends of public utility, to which ends those who founded civil society must be supposed to have intended that private ends should give way. But, when this is done, the state is bound to make good the loss to those who lose their property.</blockquote>\n\nThe exercise of eminent domain is not limited to real property. Condemnors may also take personal property,<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=7U2pK0Y69oQC&lpg=PA63&dq=%22eminent%20domain%22%20%20%22personal%20property%22&pg=PA63#v=onepage&q=%22eminent%20domain%22%20%20%22personal%20property%22&f=false|title=Evicted!

United States]] (business losses in temporary takings) and United States v. Pewee Coal Co. (operating losses caused by government operations of a mine seized during World War II). In most takings{{cn|date=January 2019}} owners are not compensated for a variety of incidental losses caused by the taking of their property that, though incurred and readily demonstrable in other cases, are deemed by the courts{{where|date=January 2019}} to be noncompensable in eminent domain.{{cn|date=January 2019}}  The same is true of attorneys' and appraisers fees.{{cn|date=January 2019}}  But as a matter of legislative grace rather than constitutional requirement some of these losses (e.g., business goodwill) have been made compensable by state legislative enactments,{{cn|date=January 2019}} and in the U.S. may be partially covered by provisions of the federal [[Uniform Relocation Assistance Act]].{{cn|date=January 2019}}\n\n== North America ==\n\n=== United States ===\n{{main|Eminent domain in the United States}}\n\nMost states use the term ''eminent domain'', but some U.S. states use the term ''[[appropriation (economics)|appropriation]]'' (New York) or ''expropriation'' (Louisiana) as synonyms for the exercise of eminent domain powers.<ref>{{cite web |title=New York Code, Public Lands, Art. 2, Sec. 27, Appropriations |url=https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/laws/PBL/27 |website=NYSenate.gov |publisher=The New York Senate |accessdate=17 May 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=Louisiana Revised Statutes, Title 19, Expropriation |url=http://www.legis.la.gov/legis/laws_Toc.aspx?folder=75&level=Parent |website=Louisiana State Legislature |accessdate=17 May 2017}}</ref> The term ''condemnation'' is used to describe the formal act of exercising this power to transfer title or some lesser interest in the subject property.\n\nThe constitutionally required \"just compensation\" in partial takings is usually measured by fair market value of the part taken, plus severance damages (the diminution in value of the property retained by the owner [remainder] when only a part of the subject property is taken). Where a partial taking provides economic benefits specific to the remainder, those must be deducted, typically from severance damages.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Larson |first1=Aaron |title=Eminent Domain|url=https://www.expertlaw.com/library/real_estate/eminent_domain.html |website=ExpertLaw.com |publisher=ExpertLaw |accessdate=17 May 2017}}</ref> The former owners of the property rarely receive full market value because some elements of value are deemed noncompensable in eminent domain law.{{citation needed|date=January 2018}}\n\nThe practice of condemnation came to the American colonies with the [[common law]]. When it came time to draft the [[United States Constitution]], differing views on eminent domain were voiced. The [[Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fifth Amendment]] to the Constitution requires that the taking be for a \"public use\" and mandates payment of \"just compensation\" to the owner.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.independent.org/pdf/tir/tir_12_03_04_benson.pdf |title=The Evolution of Eminent Domain: A Remedy for Market Failure or an Effort to Limit Government Power and Government Failure? |format=PDF |website=Independent.org |date= |accessdate=2016-08-05}}</ref>\n\nIn federal law, Congress can take private property directly (without recourse to the courts) by passing an Act transferring title of the subject property directly to the government. In such cases, the property owner seeking compensation must sue the United States for compensation in the U.S. Court of Federal Claims. The legislature may also delegate the power to private entities like public utilities or railroads, and even to individuals.<ref>See, e.g., {{cite web|title=''Linggi v. Garovotti'', 45 Cal.2d 20, 286 P.2d 15 (1955).|url=https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=15917425264572652948|website=Google Scholar|publisher=Google|accessdate=13 May 2018}}</ref> The [[U.S. Supreme Court]] has consistently deferred to the right of states to make their own determinations of \"public use\".\n\n=== Canada ===\nIn Canada, expropriation is governed by federal or provincial statutes. Under these statutory regimes, public authorities have the right to acquire private property for public purposes, so long as the acquisition is approved by the appropriate government body. Once a property is taken, an owner is entitled to \"be made whole\" by compensation for: the market value of the expropriated property, injurious affection to the remainder of the property (if any), disturbance damages, business loss, and special difficulty relocating. Owners can advance claims for compensation above that initially provided by the expropriating authority by bringing a claim before the court or an administrative body appointed by the governing legislation.\n\n==Europe==\nIn many European nations, the [[European Convention on Human Rights]] provides protection from an appropriation of private property by the state. Article 8 of the Convention provides that \"Everyone has the right to respect for his private and family life, his home, and his correspondence\" and prohibits interference with this right by the state, unless the interference is in accordance with law and necessary in the interests of [[national security]], public safety, economic well-being of the country, prevention of disorder or crime, protection of health or morals, or protection of the rights and freedoms of others. This right is expanded by Article 1 of the [[European Convention on Human Rights#toc|First Protocol]] to the Convention, which states that \"Every natural person or legal person is entitled to the peaceful enjoyment of his possessions.\" Again, this is subject to exceptions where state deprivation of private possessions is in the general or [[public interest]], is in accordance with law, and, in particular, to secure payment of [[tax]]es. Settled case-law of ECHR provides that just compensation has to be paid in cases of expropriation.<ref>See James v.the UK, decision of ECHR dated by 21 February 1986, para 54.</ref>\n\n===France===\nIn [[France]], the [[Declaration of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen]] similarly mandates just and preliminary compensation before expropriation; and a [[D\u00e9claration d'utilit\u00e9 publique]] is commonly required, to demonstrate a public benefit.\n\nNotably, in 1945, by decree of General [[Charles de Gaulle]] based on untried<ref name=\"shame\" /> accusations of collaboration, the [[Renault]] company was expropriated from Louis Renault posthumously and nationalised as ''R\u00e9gie Nationale des Usines Renault''<ref name=\"shame\">{{cite news |title=Louis Renault and the shame of a nation |publisher=The Daily Telegraph, Ian Morton |date=14 May 2005 |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/motoring/2735296/Louis-Renault-and-the-shame-of-a-nation.html |location=London}}</ref>\u2014without compensation.<ref name=\"ogre\">{{cite magazine |title=Foreign News: Was He Murdered? |magazine=Time Magazine |date=Feb 6, 1956 |url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,893292,00.html}}</ref>\n\n===England and Wales===\n{{main|Compulsory purchase in England and Wales}}\nAfter his victory in 1066, [[William the Conqueror]] seized virtually all land in England. Although he maintained absolute power over the land, he granted [[fief]]s to landholders who served as stewards, paying fees and providing military services. During the [[Hundred Years War]] in the 14th century, [[Edward III of England|Edward III]] used the Crown's right of [[purveyance]] for massive expropriations. Chapter 28 of [[Magna Carta]] required that immediate cash payment be made for expropriations. As the king's power was broken down in the ensuing centuries, tenants were regarded as holding ownership rights rather than merely possessory rights over their land. In 1427, a statute was passed granting commissioners of sewers in [[Lincolnshire]] the power to take land without compensation. After the early 16th century, however, Parliamentary takings of land for roads, bridges, etc. generally did require compensation. The common practice was to pay 10% more than the assessed value. However, as the voting franchise was expanded to include more non-landowners, the bonus was eliminated. In spite of contrary statements found in some American law, in the United Kingdom, compulsory purchase valuation cases were tried by juries well into the 20th century, such as [[Attorney-General v De Keyser's Royal Hotel Ltd]] (1919).\n\nIn [[England and Wales]], and other jurisdictions that follow the principles of [[English law]], the related term '''compulsory purchase''' is used.

[[Japan]], for instance, has very weak eminent domain powers, as evidenced by the high-profile opposition to the expansion of [[Narita International Airport]], and the disproportionately large amounts of financial inducement given to residents on sites slated for redevelopment in return for their agreement to leave, one well-known recent case being that of [[Roppongi Hills]].\n\nThere are other countries such as the [[People's Republic of China]] that practice eminent domain whenever it is convenient to make space for new communities and government structures. [[Singapore]] practices eminent domain under the Land Acquisitions Act, which allows it to carry out its [[Selective En bloc Redevelopment Scheme]] for urban renewal. The [[Amendments to the Land Titles Act]] allowed property to be purchased for purposes of urban renewal against an owner sharing a collective title if the majority of the other owners wish to sell and the minority did not. Thus, eminent domain often invokes concerns of [[majoritarianism]].\n\nIn the Bahamas, the Acquisition of Land Act operates to permit the acquisition of land where it is deemed likely to be required for a public purpose. The land can be acquired by private agreement or compulsory purchase (s7 of the Act). Under section 24 of the Acquisition of Land Act, the purchaser may purchase the interest of the mortgagee of any land acquired under the Act. To do so, the purchaser must pay the principal sum and interest, together with costs and charges plus 6 months\u2019 additional interest.\n\nSince the 1990s, the [[Zimbabwe]]an government under [[Robert Mugabe]] has seized a great deal of land and homes of mainly white farmers in the course of the [[Land reform in Zimbabwe|land reform movement in Zimbabwe]].

The most common uses of property taken by eminent domain have been for roads, government buildings and [[public utility|public utilities]]. However, in the mid-20th century, a new application of eminent domain was pioneered, in which the government could take the property and transfer it to a private third party. This was initially done only to a property that has been deemed \"blighted\" or a \"development impediment\", on the principle that such properties had a negative impact upon surrounding property owners, but was later expanded to allow the taking of any private property when the new third-party owner could develop the property in such a way as to bring in increased tax revenues to the government.\n\nSome jurisdictions require that the taker make an offer to purchase the subject property, before resorting to the use of eminent domain. However, once the property is taken and the judgment is final, the condemnor owns it in [[fee simple]], and may put it to uses other than those specified in the eminent domain action.\n\nTakings may be of the subject property in its entirety (total take) or in part (part take), either quantitatively or qualitatively (either partially in fee simple or, commonly, an easement, or any other interest less than the full fee simple title).\n\n==Meaning==\nThe term \"eminent domain\" was taken from the legal treatise ''[[De jure belli ac pacis]]'' (On the Law of War and Peace), written by the [[Netherlands|Dutch]] [[jurist]] [[Hugo Grotius]] in 1625,<ref>{{cite book |first=John E. |last=Nowak |first2=Ronald D. |last2=Rotunda |title=Constitutional Law |publisher=Thomson West |location=St. Paul, MN |year=2004 |page=263 |edition=Seventh |isbn=0-314-14452-8}}</ref> which used the term ''dominium eminens'' ([[Latin]] for ''supreme lordship'') and described the power as follows:\n<blockquote>...&nbsp; The property of subjects is under the eminent domain of the state, so that the state or those who act for it may use and even alienate and destroy such property, not only in the case of extreme necessity, in which even private persons have a right over the property of others, but for ends of public utility, to which ends those who founded civil society must be supposed to have intended that private ends should give way.

Under these statutory regimes, public authorities have the right to acquire private property for public purposes, so long as the acquisition is approved by the appropriate government body. Once a property is taken, an owner is entitled to \"be made whole\" by compensation for: the market value of the expropriated property, injurious affection to the remainder of the property (if any), disturbance damages, business loss, and special difficulty relocating. Owners can advance claims for compensation above that initially provided by the expropriating authority by bringing a claim before the court or an administrative body appointed by the governing legislation.\n\n==Europe==\nIn many European nations, the [[European Convention on Human Rights]] provides protection from an appropriation of private property by the state. Article 8 of the Convention provides that \"Everyone has the right to respect for his private and family life, his home, and his correspondence\" and prohibits interference with this right by the state, unless the interference is in accordance with law and necessary in the interests of [[national security]], public safety, economic well-being of the country, prevention of disorder or crime, protection of health or morals, or protection of the rights and freedoms of others. This right is expanded by Article 1 of the [[European Convention on Human Rights#toc|First Protocol]] to the Convention, which states that \"Every natural person or legal person is entitled to the peaceful enjoyment of his possessions.\" Again, this is subject to exceptions where state deprivation of private possessions is in the general or [[public interest]], is in accordance with law, and, in particular, to secure payment of [[tax]]es.

Although he maintained absolute power over the land, he granted [[fief]]s to landholders who served as stewards, paying fees and providing military services. During the [[Hundred Years War]] in the 14th century, [[Edward III of England|Edward III]] used the Crown's right of [[purveyance]] for massive expropriations. Chapter 28 of [[Magna Carta]] required that immediate cash payment be made for expropriations. As the king's power was broken down in the ensuing centuries, tenants were regarded as holding ownership rights rather than merely possessory rights over their land. In 1427, a statute was passed granting commissioners of sewers in [[Lincolnshire]] the power to take land without compensation. After the early 16th century, however, Parliamentary takings of land for roads, bridges, etc. generally did require compensation. The common practice was to pay 10% more than the assessed value. However, as the voting franchise was expanded to include more non-landowners, the bonus was eliminated. In spite of contrary statements found in some American law, in the United Kingdom, compulsory purchase valuation cases were tried by juries well into the 20th century, such as [[Attorney-General v De Keyser's Royal Hotel Ltd]] (1919).\n\nIn [[England and Wales]], and other jurisdictions that follow the principles of [[English law]], the related term '''compulsory purchase''' is used. The landowner is compensated with a price agreed or stipulated by an appropriate person. Where agreement on price cannot be achieved, the value of the taken land is determined by the [[Upper Tribunal]]. The operative law is a patchwork of statutes and case law. The principal Acts are the [[Lands Clauses Consolidation Act 1845]], the [[Land Compensation Act 1961]], the [[Compulsory Purchase Act 1965]], the [[Land Compensation Act 1973]], the [[Acquisition of Land Act 1981]], part IX of the [[Town and Country Planning Act 1990]], the [[Planning and Compensation Act 1991]], and the [[Planning and Compulsory Purchase Act 2004]].\n\n===Germany===\nThe [[Basic Law for the Federal Republic of Germany]] states in its Article 14 (3) that \"an expropriation is only allowed for the public good\"<ref>{{cite web |url=http://dejure.org/gesetze/GG/14.html |title=Art. 14 GG |website=Dejure.org |date= |accessdate=2016-08-08}}</ref> and just compensation must be made. It also provides for the right to have the amount of the compensation checked by a court.\n\n===Italy===\n[[File:Espropria graffiti in Turin October 2016.jpg|thumb|''Espropria'', \"expropriate\", protest graffiti in [[Turin]]]]\n''Esproprio'', or more formally ''espropriazione per pubblica utilit\u00e0'' (literally \"expropriation for public utility\") in [[Italy]] takes place within the frame of [[Civil law (area)|civil law]], as an expression of the ''potere ablatorio'' (ablative power).

Furthermore, the article 2 of the Constitution binds Italian citizens to respect their ''mandatory duties of political, economical and social solidarity''.\n\nThe implementation of the eminent domain follows two principles:<ref>{{Cite book|title=Manuale pratico dell'espropriazione|last=Assini, N.-Tescaroli, N.|first=|publisher=|year=2003|isbn=|location=Padua|pages=}}</ref>\n* legality: a public institution can exporpriate private goods only in the cases law allows it and respecting its procedures (following the article 23 of the [[Constitution of Italy|Italian Constitution]]);\n* compensation: (art. 42/III) the State must provide a certain amount of money as compensation, which is determined by the law. According to the [[Constitutional Court of Italy|Italian Constitutional Court]], this compensation is not required to be equal to the market value of the expropriated good, although this sum must not be merely symbolic.\n''Nazionalizzazione'' (\"nationalization\"), instead, is provided for by article 43 of the Constitution; it transfers to governmental authority and property a whole industrial sector, if it is deemed to be a natural or de facto [[monopoly]], and an essential service of public utility. The most famous nationalization in Italy was the [[Enel|1962 nationalization of the electrical power sector]].\n\n===Spain===\nArticle 33.3 of the [[Spanish Constitution of 1978]] allows forced expropriation (\"expropiaci\u00f3n forzosa\") only where justified on the grounds of public utility or social interest and subject to the payment of appropriate compensation as provided for in law.<ref>http://www.congreso.es/consti/constitucion/indice/titulos/articulos.jsp?ini=33&tipo=2 Constituci\u00f3n Espa\u00f1ola de 1978 Art 33 part 3</ref>\n\n===Sweden===\nExpropriation.

Article 31 provided that \"No person shall be deprived of his property save by authority of law.\" It also provided that compensation would be paid to a person whose property had been 'taken possession of or acquired' for public purposes. In addition, both the state government as well as the union (federal) government were empowered to enact laws for the \"acquisition or requisition of property\" (Schedule VII, Entry 42, List III).

[[Japan]], for instance, has very weak eminent domain powers, as evidenced by the high-profile opposition to the expansion of [[Narita International Airport]], and the disproportionately large amounts of financial inducement given to residents on sites slated for redevelopment in return for their agreement to leave, one well-known recent case being that of [[Roppongi Hills]].\n\nThere are other countries such as the [[People's Republic of China]] that practice eminent domain whenever it is convenient to make space for new communities and government structures. [[Singapore]] practices eminent domain under the Land Acquisitions Act, which allows it to carry out its [[Selective En bloc Redevelopment Scheme]] for urban renewal. The [[Amendments to the Land Titles Act]] allowed property to be purchased for purposes of urban renewal against an owner sharing a collective title if the majority of the other owners wish to sell and the minority did not. Thus, eminent domain often invokes concerns of [[majoritarianism]].\n\nIn the Bahamas, the Acquisition of Land Act operates to permit the acquisition of land where it is deemed likely to be required for a public purpose. The land can be acquired by private agreement or compulsory purchase (s7 of the Act). Under section 24 of the Acquisition of Land Act, the purchaser may purchase the interest of the mortgagee of any land acquired under the Act. To do so, the purchaser must pay the principal sum and interest, together with costs and charges plus 6 months\u2019 additional interest.\n\nSince the 1990s, the [[Zimbabwe]]an government under [[Robert Mugabe]] has seized a great deal of land and homes of mainly white farmers in the course of the [[Land reform in Zimbabwe|land reform movement in Zimbabwe]].

IGMDP was an Indian [[Ministry of Defence (India)|Ministry of Defence]] programme between the early 1980s and 2007 for the development of a comprehensive range of missiles, including the [[Agni missile]], Prithvi ballistic missile, [[Akash missile]], [[Trishul missile]] and [[Nag Missile]]. In 2010, defence minister [[A. K. Antony]] ordered the restructuring of the DRDO to give 'a major boost to defence research in the country and to ensure effective participation of the private sector in defence technology'. The key measures to make DRDO effective in its functioning include the establishment of a Defence Technology Commission with the defence minister as its chairman.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.defencetalk.com/mod-announces-major-drdo-restructuring-plan-26384/ |title=MoD Announces Major DRDO Restructuring Plan &#124; Defence & Security News at DefenceTalk |publisher=Defencetalk.com |date=17 May 2010 |access-date=31 August 2010 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101129020637/http://www.defencetalk.com/mod-announces-major-drdo-restructuring-plan-26384/ |archivedate=29 November 2010 |df=dmy-all }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.defpro.com/news/details/15208/ |title=defence.professionals |publisher=defpro.com |accessdate=31 August 2010 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110515212759/http://www.defpro.com/news/details/15208/ |archivedate=15 May 2011 |df=dmy-all }}</ref> The programmes which were largely managed by DRDO have seen considerable success with many of the systems seeing rapid deployment as well as yielding significant technological benefits.

This system saw the DRDO cooperate extensively with the privately owned industrial sector in India. As of 2016, the Pinaka Mk1 system, with rockets of up to 40&nbsp;km striking distance, has been successfully inducted in the Indian Army, with two regiments in service and two more on order. The Pinaka Mk2 program with rockets of up to 60&nbsp;km in range, has cleared trials and has been recommended for induction as well.\n* A new long-range tactical rocket system, referred to as the Prahaar (with the name meaning \"Strike\", in Hindi) program, while an exportable derivative was named as the Pragati (\"Progress\" in Hindi) and displayed in a South Korean arms fair. The DRDO's project has seen trials around fielding a long-range tactical strike system, moving on from the successful Pinaka project. The aim is to develop a long-range system able to strike at a range of 100\u2013120&nbsp;km, with each rocket in the system, having a payload of up to 250&nbsp;kg. The new MBRS's rocket will have a maximum speed of 4.7 mach and will rise to an altitude of 40&nbsp;km, before hitting its target at 1.8 mach. There is also a move to put a sophisticated new inertial guidance system on the rockets whilst keeping cost constraints in mind. The DRDO has evaluated the IMI-Elisra developed trajectory control system and its technology, for use with the Pinaka, and a further development of the system could presumably be used with the new MBRL as well.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.thehindubusinessline.com/2005/09/18/stories/2005091800620500.htm |title=Defence scientists plan artillery rockets with 100-km range |publisher=Hindu Business Line |date=18 September 2005 |access-date=31 August 2010 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100731023204/http://www.thehindubusinessline.com/2005/09/18/stories/2005091800620500.htm |archivedate=31 July 2010 |df=dmy-all }}</ref>\n* DRDO's ARDE developed 81&nbsp;mm and the,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://ofbindia.gov.in/products/data/ammunition/mb/11.htm |title=Ordnance Factory Board |publisher=Ofbindia.gov.in |accessdate=31 August 2010 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100730125943/http://ofbindia.gov.in/products/data/ammunition/mb/11.htm |archivedate=30 July 2010 |df=dmy-all }}</ref> 120&nbsp;mm illuminating bombs<ref>{{cite web |url=http://ofbindia.gov.in/products/data/ammunition/mb/14.htm |title=Ordnance Factory Board |publisher=Ofbindia.gov.in |access-date=31 August 2010 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100930004941/http://ofbindia.gov.in/products/data/ammunition/mb/14.htm |archivedate=30 September 2010 |df=dmy-all }}</ref> and 105&nbsp;mm illuminating shells<ref>{{cite web |url=http://ofbindia.gov.in/products/data/ammunition/lc/9.htm |title=Ordnance Factory Board |publisher=Ofbindia.gov.in |access-date=31 August 2010 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100730125246/http://ofbindia.gov.in/products/data/ammunition/lc/9.htm |archivedate=30 July 2010 |df=dmy-all }}</ref> for the [[Indian Army]]'s infantry and Artillery.\n* A 51&nbsp;mm Lightweight Infantry Platoon Mortar for the Indian Army.

The R118 can also fuse data from different sensors such as the aircraft radar, missile/laser warning systems and present the unified data on a multi-function display. The DRDO also noted that its new Radar Warner Jammer systems (RWJ) were at an advanced stage of development and would be submitted for trials. The RWJ is capable of detecting all foreseen threats and jamming multiple targets simultaneously.\n* Other EW projects revealed by the DRDO include the MAWS project (a joint venture by the DRDO and EADS) which leverages EADS hardware and DRDO software to develop MAWS systems for transport, helicopter and fighter fleets. DRDO also has laser warning systems available.\n* A [[DIRCM]] (Directed Infra Red Countermeasures) project to field a worldclass DIRCM system intended to protect aircraft from infrared [[guided weapons]].\n* The DRDO is also developing an all new ESM project in cooperation with the [[Indian Air Force]]'s Signals Intelligence Directorate, under the name of \"Divya Drishti\" (''Divine Sight''). Divya Drishti will field a range of static as well as mobile ESM stations that can \"fingerprint\"  and track multiple airborne targets for mission analysis purposes. The system will be able to intercept a range of radio frequency emissions like radar, navigational, communication or electronic countermeasure signals. The various components of the project will be networked via [[Communications satellite|SATCOM]] links.\n* Additional DRDO EW projects delivered to the Indian Air Force have included the COIN A and COIN B SIGINT stations. DRDO and BEL developed ELINT equipment for the Indian Air Force, installed on the service's Boeing 737s and Hawker Siddeley Avro aircraft. DRDO has also developed a Radar Fingerprinting System for the IAF and the Navy.\n* Another high accuracy ESM system is being developed by the DRDO for the [[DRDO AEW&CS|AEW&C]] project. The Indian Air Force's AEW&C systems will also include a comprehensive ESM suite, capable of picking up both radars as well as conducting [[COMINT|Communications Intelligence]].\n\n====Radars====\n\nThe DRDO has steadily increased its radar development. The result has been substantial progress in India's ability to design and manufacture high power radar systems with locally sourced components and systems. This began with the development of short-range 2D systems (Indra-1) and has now extended to high power 3D systems like LRTR intended for strategic purposes. Several other projects span the gamut of radar applications, from airborne surveillance ([[Airborne early warning and control|AEW&C]]) to firecontrol radars (land based and airborne).

This was the first high power radar developed by the DRDO, with the Indra-I radar for the Indian Army, followed by Indra Pulse Compression (PC) version for the Indian Air Force, also known as the Indra-II, which is a low level radar to search and track low flying cruise missiles, helicopters and aircraft. These are 2D radars that provide range and azimuth information and are meant to be used as gap fillers. The Indra 2 PC has pulse compression providing improved range resolution. The series is used both by the [[Indian Air Force]] and the [[Indian Army]]\n*[[File:Rajendra Radar.jpg|thumb|[[Rajendra Radar|Rajendra fire control radar]] at Adamya Chaitanya Exhibition 2016]][[Rajendra Radar|Rajendra fire control radar]] for the [[Akash missile|Akash SAM]]: The Rajendra is stated to be ready. However, it can be expected that further iterative improvements will be made. The Rajendra is a high power [[Passive electronically scanned array]] radar (PESA), with the ability able to guide up to 12 Akash SAMs against aircraft flying at low to medium altitudes. The Rajendra has a detection range of 80&nbsp; km with 18&nbsp; km height coverage against small fighter-sized targets and is able to track 64 targets, engaging 4 simultaneously, with up to 3 missiles per target. The Rajendra features a fully digital high-speed signal processing system with an adaptive moving target indicator, coherent signal processing, FFTs, and variable pulse repetition frequency. The entire PESA antenna array can swivel 360 degrees on a rotating platform. This allows the radar antenna to be rapidly repositioned and even conduct all-round surveillance.\n* [[Central Acquisition Radar (3D-CAR)|Central Acquisition Radar]], a state of the art planar array S-band radar operating on the stacked beam principle. With a range of 180&nbsp;km, it can [[track while scan]] 200 fighter-sized targets. Its systems are integrated on high mobility, locally built TATRA trucks for the Army and Air Force; however, it is meant to be used by all three services. Initially developed for the long-running Akash SAM system, seven were ordered by the Indian Air Force for their radar modernization program and two of another variants were ordered by the Indian Navy for their P-28 Corvettes. The CAR has been a significant success for radar development in India, with its state of the art signal processing hardware.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.acig.org/artman/uploads/os_car_001.jpg |title=JPEG image of the 3D CAR, image copyright Acig.org |accessdate=31 August 2010 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110606225833/http://www.acig.org/artman/uploads/os_car_001.jpg |archivedate=6 June 2011 |df=dmy-all }}</ref><ref>{{cite news |url=http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/PoliticsNation/IAF_going_through_stage_of_modernisation_Major/articleshow/3705906.cms |title=IAF modernisation |publisher=Economictimes.indiatimes.com |date=12 November 2008 |accessdate=31 August 2010 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090111125239/http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/PoliticsNation/IAF_going_through_stage_of_modernisation_Major/articleshow/3705906.cms |archivedate=11 January 2009 |df=dmy-all }}</ref> The ROHINI is the IAF specific variant while the REVATHI is the Indian Navy specific variant.

This program was subsequently superseded by the advanced XV-2004 which offered a more sophisticated architecture able to handle SAR and ISAR modes. The SV-2000 is a lightweight, high performance, slotted array radar operating in the X-Band. It can detect sea-surface targets such as a periscope or a vessel against heavy clutter and can also be used for navigation, weather mapping, and beacon detection. The radar can detect a large vessel at over 100 nautical miles (370&nbsp; km). It is currently under modification to be fitted to the Advanced Light Helicopter and the Navy's Do-228's. Variants can be fitted to the Navy's Ka-25's as well. A more advanced variant of the Super Vision, known as the XV-2004 is now in trials and features an ISAR, SAR Capability intended for the Indian Navy's helicopter fleet.\n* [[Swordfish Long Range Tracking Radar]], a 3D AESA was developed with assistance from [[Elta]] of [[Israel]] and is similar to Elta's proven GreenPine long-range Active Array radar. The DRDO developed the signal processing and software for tracking high-speed ballistic missile targets as well as introduced more ruggedization. The radar uses mostly Indian designed and manufactured components such as its critical high power, L Band Transmit-Receive modules and other enabling technologies necessary for active phased array radars. The LRTR can track 200 targets and has a range of above 500&nbsp; km. It can detect [[Intermediate-range ballistic missile]]. The LRTR would be amongst the key elements of the [[Indian Ballistic Missile Defence Programme]]. DRDO would provide the technology to private and public manufacturers to make these high power systems.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.hindu.com/2005/04/15/stories/2005041509810400.htm |title=Details of LRTR from 2004 |publisher=Hindu.com |date=15 April 2005 |accessdate=31 August 2010 |location=Chennai, India |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100809122055/http://www.hindu.com/2005/04/15/stories/2005041509810400.htm |archivedate=9 August 2010 |df=dmy-all }}</ref>\n* 3D Multi-Function Control Radar (MFCR) was developed as part of the Indian anti-ballistic missile program in cooperation with [[Thales Group|THALES]] of France. The MFCR is an active phased array radar and complements the ''Swordfish Long Range Tracking Radar'', for intercepting ballistic missiles. The MFCR will also serve as the fire control radar for the AAD second-tier missile system of the ABM program. The AAD has a supplementary role against aircraft as well and can engage missiles and aircraft up to an altitude of 30&nbsp; km. The MFCR fills out the final part of the DRDO's radar development spectrum and allows India to manufacture long-range 3D radars that can act as the nodes of an Air Defence Ground Environment system.\n* 2D Low-Level Lightweight Radar (LLLWR) for the Indian Army, known as the Bharani, which requires many of these units for gap-filling in mountainous terrain and has been ordered into production after clearing Indian Army trials. The Indian Air Force will also acquire a more advanced unit, called the Aslesha. The LLLWR is a 2D radar with a range of 40&nbsp; km against a 2 square meter target, intended as a gap-filler to plug detection gaps versus low-level aircraft in an integrated Air Defence Ground network. The LLLWR makes use of Indra-2 technology, namely a similar antenna array, but has roughly half the range and is much smaller and a far more portable unit. The LLLWR can [[track while scan]] 100 targets and provide details about their speed, azimuth, and range to the operator. The LLLWR makes use of the BFSR-SR experience and many of the subsystem providers are the same. Multiple LLLWRs can be networked together. The LLLWR is meant to detect low-level intruders, and will alert Army Air Defence fire control units to cue their weapon systems.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://media.bharat-rakshak.com/aero/main.php?g2_itemId=1355 |title=LLLR Specifications |publisher=Media.bharat-rakshak.com |date=18 January 2007 |accessdate=31 August 2010 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071021103105/http://media.bharat-rakshak.com/aero/main.php?g2_itemId=1355 |archivedate=21 October 2007 |df=dmy }}</ref>\n* 3D Short-Range Radar for the Indian Air Force \u2013 ASLESHA: The ASLESHA radars have a range of approximately 50&nbsp; km against small fighter-sized targets and will be able to determine their range, speed, azimuth, and height. This radar will enable the Indian Air Force Air Defence units to accurately track low-level intruders. The radar is a semi-active phased array with a 1-meter square aperture. The DRDO was in discussions with the Indian Navy to mount these systems on small ships.\n* Multi-mode radar, a 3D radar is a HAL project with DRDO's LRDE as a subsystem provider. This project to develop an advanced, lightweight Multi-mode fire control radar for the [[LCA Tejas]] fighter had faced challenges and was delayed and finally superseded by a program called the Uttam to develop an AESA FCR for the Tejas LCA. The MMR program was finally completed with Elta's (Israel) assistance and became a hybrid system incorporating the original DRDO antenna, gimbal stabilization, and Israeli backend. The multi-mode radar has the range (for detection of a small fighter target) around 100&nbsp; km can track 10 targets, can engage 2 targets and uses the lightweight system. Originally, DRDO developed an all-new combined signal and the data processor had been developed, replacing the original separate units. The new unit is much more powerful and makes use of contemporary ADSP processors. The radar's critical hardware was also developed and validated. The software for the air-to-air mode has been developed considerably (including search and track while scan in both look up and look down modes) but air-to-ground modes were still being worked upon and proved problematic. The radar development was shown to be considerably more mature than previously thought but still faced significant delays and challenges. At Aero India 2009, it was revealed that the 3D MMR project has been superseded by the new 3D AESA FCR project led by LRDE. The MMR has been completed with Elta Israel's assistance and now involved [[Elta]] [[EL/M-2032]] technology for Air-to-Ground mapping and targeting \u2013 in order to simplify testing, the Hybrid MMR basically became an Indian variant of the EL/M-2032 with an Indian antenna and gimbal system as Elta pointed out mixing and matching Indian hardware with Israeli software would, in essence, mean a new design with a significant time impact. The \"hybrid\" MMR has been tested, validated and will be supplied for the initial [[LCA Tejas]] fighters.\n* DRDO has indigenized components and improved subsystems of various other license-produced radars manufactured at [[Bharat Electronics Limited|BEL]] with the help of BEL scientists and other researchers. These improvements include new radar data processors for license-produced signal radars as well as local radar assemblies replacing the earlier imported ones.\n* [[BEL Weapon Locating Radar]]:[[File:Weapon Locating Radar (Swathi) passes through the Rajpath, on the occasion of the 69th Republic Day Parade 2018, in New Delhi on January 26, 2018.jpg|thumb|BEL Weapon Locating Radar (Swathi) passes on the occasion of the 69th Republic Day Parade 2018.]]Swati, a 3D radar developed from the Rajendra fire-control radar for the Akash system, uses a [[passive electronically scanned array]] to detect multiple targets for fire correction and weapon location.

The Indian Army has ordered 28 of these units. \n* 3D Tactical Control Radar: a new program, the TCR is an approximately 90&nbsp; km ranged system for use by the Indian Army. A highly mobile unit, it is a variant of the 3D CAR unit and packaged into 2 as verses 3 units. The Indian Army has ordered many of the types for its Air Defense Units.\n\nApart from the above, the DRDO has also several other radar systems currently under development or in trials, these include:\n\n* Active Phased Array radar: a 3D radar for fighters, an MMR follow on, the APAR project aims to field a fully-fledged operational AESA fire control radar for the expected Mark-2 version of the [[Light Combat Aircraft]]. This will be the second airborne AESA program after the AEW&C project and intends to replicate DRDO's success with the ground-based radar segment to airborne systems. The overall airborne APAR program aims to prevent this technology gap from developing, with a broad-based program to bring DRDO up to par with international developers in airborne systems, both fire control, and surveillance. As of 2016, the radar was still in development, with variants expected to be fielded on future IAF fighters like the MCA or Tejas advanced Marks.\n* [[Synthetic aperture radar]] & [[Inverse synthetic aperture radar]]: the DRDO's LRDE is currently working on both SAR and ISAR radars for target detection and classification. These lightweight payloads are intended for both conventional fixed wing as well as [[Unmanned Aerial Vehicle|UAV]] applications.\n* Airborne Warning and Control: a new radar-based on [[active electronically scanned array]] technology. The aim of the project is to develop an in-house capability for high power AEW&C systems, with the system covering the development of an S-Band AESA array. The aircraft will also have data-links to link fighters plus communicate with the IAF's C3I infrastructure as well as a local SATCOM (satellite communication system), along with other onboard ESM and COMINT systems.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.blonnet.com/2006/01/25/stories/2006012501641500.htm |title=Aircraft for AWACS to be chosen by the IAF |publisher=Blonnet.com |date=25 January 2006 |accessdate=31 August 2010 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100813033613/http://www.blonnet.com/2006/01/25/stories/2006012501641500.htm |archivedate=13 August 2010 |df=dmy-all }}</ref> As of 2016, the system was in advanced trials and had achieved a TRL (Technical Readiness Level) of 8/10 with trials focusing on proving its self-protection equipment.\n* Medium-Range Battlefield Surveillance Radar: in 2009, the LRDE (DRDO) noted that it was working on a ''Long-range'' battlefield surveillance radar. It is possible that the BFSR-LR project has replaced this earlier project and the [[Indian Army]] will utilize the BEL built [[ELTA]] designed BFSR-MR's for Medium-Range surveillance while using the LRDE designed systems for Long Range surveillance. The 2D radar was to track ground targets and provide key intelligence to the Indian Army's artillery units, with the resultant information available on various tactical networks. As of 2016, this project was not active.\n* 3D Medium Power Radar: a spin-off of the experience gained via the 3D MFCR project, the 3D Medium Power Radar project is intended to field a radar with a range of approximately 300&nbsp; km against small fighter-sized targets. Intended for the Indian Air Force, the radar is an active phased array, and will be transportable. It will play a significant role being used as part of the nodes of the [[Indian Air Force]]'s enhanced Air Defence Ground Environment System. As of 2016, the radar was ready for IAF user trials and the IAF had ordered 8 MPRs already.\n* 3D Low-Level Transportable Radar: A new program, the LLTR is also called the Ashwini and is an approximately 200\u2013150&nbsp; km ranged system for use by the Indian  Air Force. A highly mobile unit, it will also employ AESA technology, and [[open architecture]] to provide easy upgrades and a variety of modes and capabilities depending on the software fit. The aim of the 3D Medium Power Radar and LLTR is to offer systems that can be deployed in a variety of roles, from fire control to surveillance, and not be tied to one role alone. As of 2016, the LLTR program was in an advanced stage and expected to reach the trials phase\n* 3D Army AD Fire Control Radar: A new program for the Indian Army, the Atulya FCR is intended to provide Army AD units with a compact fire control system for their armament. The Indian Army has a total requirement of over 60 FCRs.\n* 3D Army Multi-Mission Radar: A new program for the Indian Army, the mobile compact radar system is expected to be capable of both artillery detection and air defense missions. As of 2016, it was in an advanced stage of development, with basic design completed and realization of the prototype underway.\n\n====Command and control software and decision-making tools====\n* Tactical tools for wargaming: Shatranj and Sangram for the Army, Sagar for the Navy and air war software for the Air Force. All these systems are operational with the respective services.\n* C3I systems: DRDO, in cooperation with BEL and private industry has developed several critical C3I (command, control, communications and intelligence systems) for the armed services. Under the project \"Shakti\", the Indian Army aims to spend {{USD}}300 million to network all its artillery guns using the ACCS (Artillery Command and Control System). Developed by DRDO's Centre for Artificial Intelligence & Robotics, the system comprises computers and intelligent terminals connected as a wide area network. Its main subsystems are the artillery computer centre, battery computer, remote access terminal and a gun display unit. The ACCS is expected to improve the Army's artillery operations by a factor of 10 and allowing for more rapid and accurate firepower. The ACCS will also improve the ability of commanders to concentrate that fire-power where it is most needed. The DRDO and BEL have also developed a Battle Management system for the [[Indian Army]] for its tanks and tactical units.\n\nOther programmes in development for the Army include Corps level information and decision making software and tools, intended to link all units together for effective C3I. These systems are in production at DRDO's production partner, [[Bharat Electronics]]. These projects are being driven by the [[Indian Army Corps of Signals]]. The Indian Army is also moving towards extensive use of battlefield computers. DRDO has also delivered projects such as the Combat Net Radio for enhancing the Army's communication hardware.\n* Data management and command and control systems for the Navy have been provided by the DRDO. The Navy is currently engaged in a naval networking project to network all its ships and shore establishments plus maritime patrol aircraft and sensors.\n* Radar netting and multi-sensor fusion software for linking the Indian Air Force's network of radars and airbases which have been operationalised. Other systems include sophisticated and highly complex ''mission planning and C3I systems'' for missiles, such as the Agni and Prithvi ballistic missiles and the Brahmos cruise missile. These systems are common to all three services as all of them utilise different variants of these missiles.\n* Simulators and training tools: DRDO and private industry have collaborated on manufacturing a range of simulators and training devices for the three services, from entry level tests for prospective entrants to the Indian Air Force, to sophisticated simulators for fighter aircraft, transports and helicopters, tanks and gunnery devices.\n\n====Computing technologies====\n\nDRDO has worked extensively on high speed computing given its ramifications for most of its defence projects. These include supercomputers for computational flow dynamics, to dedicated microprocessor designs manufactured in India for flight controllers and the like, to high speed computing boards built around Commercial Off The Shelf (COTS) components, similar to the latest trends in the defence industry.\n* Supercomputing: DRDO's ANURAG developed the PACE+<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.hpcwire.com/archives/5465.html |title=Report from 1995 on the initial PACE system |publisher=Hpcwire.com |date=4 May 1995 |accessdate=31 August 2010 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100809225656/http://www.hpcwire.com/archives/5465.html |archivedate=9 August 2010 |df=dmy-all }}</ref> Supercomputer for strategic purposes for supporting its various programmes. The initial version, as detailed in 1995, had the following specifications: The system delivered a sustained performance of more than 960 Mflops (million floating operations per second) for computational [[fluid dynamics]] programmes. Pace-Plus included 32 advanced computing nodes, each with 64 megabytes(MB) of memory that can be expanded up to 256MB and a powerful front-end processor which is a [[hyperSPARC]] with a speed of 66/90/100 megahertz (MHz). Besides fluid dynamics, these high-speed computer systems were used in areas such as vision, medical imaging, signal processing, molecular modeling, neural networks and finite element analysis. The latest variant of the PACE series is the PACE ++, a 128 node parallel processing system. With a front-end processor, it has a distributed memory and message passing system. Under Project '''Chitra''', the DRDO is implementing a system with a computational speed of 2-3 Teraflops utilising commercial off the shelf components and the Open Source Linux Operating System.\n* Processors and other critical items: DRDO has developed a range of processors and application specific integrated circuits for its critical projects. Many of these systems are modular, in the sense that they can be reused across different projects. These include \"Pythagoras processor\" to convert cartesian to polar coordinates, ANUCO, a floating point coprocessor and several others, including the ANUPAMA 32-bit processor, which is being used in several DRDO projects.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.electronicsforu.com/electronicsforu/articles/hits.asp?id=1106 |title=ANUPAMA processor |publisher=Electronicsforu.com |accessdate=31 August 2010}}</ref>\n* Electronic components: one of the endeavours undertaken by the DRDO has been to create a substantial local design and development capability within India, both in the private and public sectors. This policy has led to several hard to obtain or otherwise denied items, being designed and manufactured in India. These include components such as radar subsystems (product specific travelling wave tubes) to components necessary for electronic warfare and other cutting edge projects. Today, there are a range of firms across India, which design and manufacture key components for DRDO, allowing it to source locally for quite a substantial chunk of its procurement. The DRDO has also endeavoured to use COTS (Commercial off the shelf) processors and technology, and follow Open Architecture standards, wherever possible, in order to pre-empt obsolescence issues and follow industry practise. One significant example is the development of an Open Architecture computer for the Light Combat Aircraft, based on the PowerPC architecture and VME64 standard. Variants of the earlier Mission computer utilising Intel 486 DX chips are already present on the Su-30 MKI, Jaguar and MiG-27 Upgrades for the Indian Air Force.\n\n====Laser Science & Technology Centre (LASTEC)====\nDRDO is working on a slew of directed energy weapons (DEWs). LASTEC has identified DEWs, along with space security, cyber-security and hypersonic vehicles as focus areas in the next 15 years.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/DRDOs-next-Star-Wars-like-weapons/articleshow/6248942.cms#ixzz3qGVfeigT|title=DRDO's next: Star Wars-like weapons|publisher=The Times of India|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151020161307/http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/DRDOs-next-Star-Wars-like-weapons/articleshow/6248942.cms#ixzz3qGVfeigT|archivedate=20 October 2015|df=dmy-all}}</ref> The aim is to develop laser-based weapons, deployed on airborne as well as seaborne platforms, which can intercept missiles soon after they are launched towards India in the boost phase itself. These will be part of the ballistic missile defence system being currently developed by DRDO. LASTEC is developing a 25-kilowatt laser system to hit a missile during its terminal phase at a distance of 5\u20137&nbsp;km. LASTEC is also working on a vehicle-mounted gas dynamic laser-based DEW system, under project Aditya, which should be ready in three years. Project Aditya is a technology demonstrator to prove beam control technology. Ultimately, solid-state lasers would be used. For US President [[Donald Trump]] visit to India in 2020, DRDO deployed the LASTEC developed vehicle-mounted gas dynamic laser-based DEW system for counter-drone operations in [[Ahmedabad]] after completion of successful trial on February 21, 2020.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.livemint.com/news/india/how-this-drdo-made-weapon-will-safeguard-skies-during-trump-modi-s-roadshow-11582286736993.html|title=How this DRDO-made weapon will safeguard skies during Trump-Modi's roadshow|date=2020-02-21|website=Livemint|language=en|access-date=2020-03-06}}</ref> It can detect, identify and destroy low flying objects of smaller size carrying explosives or arms and ammunitions.

Local systems include the DRDO-developed [[Reactive armour|ERA]], a DRDO-developed laser warning system and combat net radio, the Bharat Electronics Limited advanced land navigation system consisting of fibre optic gyros and GPS, [[Weapon of mass destruction|NBC]] protection and DRDO's fire detection and suppression system amongst other items. Imported systems include a compact [[Thermographic camera|thermal imager]] and fire control system and a new 1000&nbsp;hp engine.\n* Anti-tank ammunition: DRDO developed the [[Kinetic energy penetrator|FSAPDS]] for the 125&nbsp;mm calibre, meant for India's T-72 tanks, the 120&nbsp;mm [[Kinetic energy penetrator|FSAPDS]] and [[High explosive squash head|HESH]] rounds for the [[Arjun MBT|Arjun tank]] and 105&nbsp;mm [[Kinetic energy penetrator|FSAPDS]] rounds for the Army's [[Vijayanta]] and [[T-55]] tanks. Significant amounts of 125&nbsp;mm anti-tank rounds manufactured by the Ordnance Factory Board were rejected. The problems were traced to improper packaging of the charges by the OFB, leading to propellant leakage during storage at high temperatures. The locally developed rounds were rectified and requalified. Production of these local rounds was then restarted. Since 2001, over {{formatnum:130000}} rounds have been manufactured by the OFB. The DRDO said in 2005 that it had developed a Mk2 version of the 125&nbsp;mm round, with higher power propellant for greater penetration. In parallel, the OFB announced in 2006 that it was also manufacturing 125&nbsp;mm IMI ([[Israel Military Industries]]) rounds. It is believed that this might assist in improving the OFB's APFSDS manufacturing capability. These rounds and presumably the Mk2 round and will be used by both the [[T-72]] and [[T-90]] formations in the [[Indian Army]].<ref>{{cite web |author=Press Trust of India / New Delhi&nbsp;3 October 2005 |url=http://www.business-standard.com/bsonline/storypage.php?autono=219530 |title=OFB manufacturing new 125 mm round from IMI |publisher=Business-standard.com |date=3 October 2005 |access-date=31 August 2010 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100729034307/http://www.business-standard.com/bsonline/storypage.php?autono=219530 |archivedate=29 July 2010 |df=dmy-all }}</ref><ref>[http://mod.nic.in/reports/MOD-English2006.pdf MOD Annual Report from 2006 with details on new DRDO projects delivered, including new 125 mm MK2 FSAPDS] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927013233/http://mod.nic.in/reports/MOD-English2006.pdf |date=27 September 2007 }} [PDF File]</ref>\n* Various armour technologies and associated subsystems from [[composite armour]] and [[explosive reactive armour]] to ''Radios'' (Combat Net Radio with frequency hopping and encryption) and Battle Management systems.

The main sub-systems of mobile decontamination system are: pre-wash, chemical wash and post wash systems respectively. The pre-wash system consists of a 3000-litre stainless steel water tank and a fast suction pump. A high-pressure jet with a capacity of 3400 l/hour and a low-pressure jet with a capacity of 900 l/hour and 1600 l/hour are included. The chemical wash system is capable of mixing two powders and two liquids with variable feed rates and has a five-litre per minute slurry emulsion flow rate. The post wash system consists of a high-pressure hot water jet, a hot water shower for personnel and provision of steam for decontamination of clothing. The decontamination systems have been introduced into the services. The system is under production for the Army at DRDO's partnering firms, with the DRDO itself manufacturing the pilot batch.\n* Remotely Operated Vehicle (ROV)/[[DRDO Daksh|Daksh]]: A tracked robotic vehicle with staircase climbing ability has been developed and is particularly intended for remote explosion of explosive devices.

The Army will deploy the Nag on ground-based launchers and from helicopters, whereas the Air Force will rely on helicopter based units. The Nag has an Imaging Infrared (IIR) seeker and has a top and direct attack capability, with a tandem warhead. The Army's land missile carrier and launcher, known as the Namica, carries several ready to use Nag missiles within and four Nag missiles in an extendable launcher above the turret. The Namica has its own FLIR based sighting and fire control unit.\n\n[[File:Nag with NAMICA Defexpo-2008.JPG|thumb|[[Nag missile]]]]\n\nThe Air Force and Army will also use their Advanced Light helicopters (ALH) ([[HAL Dhruv]]) and the [[HAL Light Combat Helicopter]] (LHC) as Nag carriers. The ALHs will be equipped with IRDE (DRDO) developed HELITIS (Heliborne Imaging and Targeting systems) with a combination of a FLIR and laser range finder in a stabilised turret for target acquisition and designation. The thermal imager is likely to be imported, but the gimballed turret, stabilisation, laser range finder and associated electronics have been designed in India and will be manufactured locally. The Nag ATGM is regarded as a highly capable missile, even though its development has been protracted, mainly due to the technological challenges of developing a state of the art IIR sensor equipped top attack missile. The Nag is still cheaper than most imported missiles in its category and is earmarked for the Army and Air Force.\n\nThe Nag anti-tank guided missile was cleared for production in July 2009 and there are uncorroborated reports since that it may be purchased by [[Tanzania]], [[Botswana]] and [[Morocco]].<ref name=\"export\">{{cite news|title=India seeks to boost military exports to Gulf|url=http://www.siliconindia.com/shownews/India_seeks_to_boost_military_exports_to_Gulf___-nid-18916.html|author=IANS|publisher=SiliconIndia.com|authorlink=Indo-Asian News Service|date=20 March 2003|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110511105844/http://www.siliconindia.com/shownews/India_seeks_to_boost_military_exports_to_Gulf___-nid-18916.html|archivedate=11 May 2011|df=dmy-all}}</ref> The Nag will complement the existing Russian [[9M113 Konkurs|9M113 Konkurs Anti-tank guided missile]] and European missile [[MILAN]] in Indian usage, both of which are manufactured under licence by Bharat Dynamics Limited.\n\n====Brahmos====\n{{main|BrahMos}}\n\nLaunched as a joint venture between India's DRDO and the Russian NPO, the BrahMos programme aims at creating a range of missile systems derived from the [[Yakhont]] missile system.

Similar to the BrahMos, Shaurya is stored in composite canisters, which makes it much easier to store for long periods without maintenance as well as to handle and transport. It also houses the gas generator to eject the missile from the canister before its solid propellant motors take over to hurl it at the intended target.\n\nShaurya missiles can remain hidden or camouflaged in underground silos from enemy surveillance or satellites till they are fired from the special storage-cum-launch canisters. The Shaurya system will require some more tests before it becomes fully operational in two to three years. Moreover, defence scientists say the high-speed, two-stage Shaurya has high maneuverability which also makes it less vulnerable to existing anti-missile defence systems.\n\nIt can be easily transported by road. The missile, encased in a canister, is mounted on a single vehicle, which has only a driver's cabin, and the vehicle itself is the launch platform. This \"single vehicle solution\" reduces its signature \u2013 it cannot be easily detected by satellites \u2013 and makes its deployment easy. The gas generator, located at the bottom of the canister produces high pressure gas, which expands and ejects the missile from the tube.\n\nThe centrepiece of a host of new technologies incorporated in Shaurya is its [[ring laser gyroscope]] (RLG) and [[accelerometer]]. The indigenous ring laser gyroscope, a sophisticated navigation and guidance system developed by the Research Centre Imarat (RCI) based in Hyderabad is a highly classified technology.\n\nIn test flights the RLG functioned exceptionally well. the RLG monitors the missile's position in space when it is flying. The missile's on-board computer will use this information and compare it with the desired position. Based on the difference between the missile's actual and desired positions, the computer will decide the optimum path and the actuators will command the missile to fly in its desired/targeted position.\nThe third test of the RLG was successful on 24 September 2011, reaching a speed of 7.5 mach. It is now ready for production.\n\n====Sagarika====\n{{main|Sagarika (missile)}}\n\nThe K-15 Sagarika is a nuclear-capable submarine-launched ballistic missile belonging to the [[K Missile family]] with a range of 750 kilometres (466&nbsp;mi). Sagarika can carry a payload of up to 500 kilograms (1,102&nbsp;lb). Sagarika was developed at the DRDO's missile complex in Hyderabad.\n\nThis missile will form part of the triad in India's nuclear deterrence, and will provide retaliatory nuclear strike capability. The development of this missile (under the title Project K-15) started in 1991. The Indian government first confirmed Sagarika's development seven years later (1998), when the then Defence Minister, George Fernandes, announced it during a press conference.\n\nThe development of the underwater missile launcher, known as Project 420 (P420), was completed in 2001 and handed over to the Indian Navy for trials. The missile was successfully test-fired six times, and tested to its full range up to three times. The test of missile from a submerged pontoon was conducted in February 2008.\n\nSagarika is being integrated with India's nuclear-powered [[Arihant class submarine]]s that began sea trials on 26 July 2009.\n\n====Prahaar====\n{{Main|Prahaar (missile)}}\n\nPrahaar is a solid-fueled surface-to-surface guided short-range tactical ballistic missile developed by DRDO of India.

While DRDO had revealed some details about the project over the years, its progress had been marked by strict secrecy, and the project itself was unlisted, and not visible among DRDO's other programmes. The ABM project has benefited from all the incremental improvements achieved by the DRDO and its associated industrial partners via the long-running and often contentious [[Akash missile]] and [[Trishul (missile)|Trishul]] missile programmes. However, it is a completely new programme, with much larger scope and with predominantly new subsystems.\n\nThe ABM project has two missiles\u2014namely the AAD (Advanced Air Defence) and PAD (Prithvi Air Defence) missiles. The former is an endo-atmospheric interceptor of new design, which can intercept targets to a height of {{convert|30|km|0|abbr=on}}. Whereas the latter is a modified Prithvi missile, dubbed the Axo-atmospheric interceptor (AXO) with a dedicated second stage kill vehicle for ballistic missile interception, up to an altitude of {{convert|80|km|0|abbr=on}}. Both these missiles are cued by an active phased array Long Range Tracking Radar, similar to the Elta GreenPine but made with locally developed components, which include DRDO-developed transmit/receive modules. The ABM system also makes use of a second radar, known as the Multi-Function Control Radar which assists the LRTR in classifying the target, and can also act as the fire control radar for the AAD missile. The MFCR, like the LRTR, is an active phased array system.\n\nThe entire system was tested in November 2006, under the Prithvi Air Defence Exercise, when a prototype AXO missile intercepted another [[Prithvi missile]] at a height of {{convert|50|km|0|abbr=on}}. This test was preceded by an \"electronic test\" in which an actual target missile was launched, but the entire interceptor system was tested electronically, albeit no actual interceptor was launched. This test was successful in its entirety. The AAD Missile was tested on December 2007 which successfully intercepted a modified Prithvi missile simulating the [[M9 Anti-tank Rocket Launcher|M-9]] and [[M-11 Shtorm|M-11]] class of ballistic missiles.

The organisation includes around 5,000 scientists belonging to the [[Defence Research & Development Service]] (DRDS) and about 25,000 other scientific, technical and supporting personnel.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.drdo.gov.in/drdo/English/index.jsp?pg=genesis.jsp|title=DRDO|website=www.drdo.gov.in|language=en|access-date=2017-05-15|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170806181721/https://www.drdo.gov.in/drdo/English/index.jsp?pg=genesis.jsp|archivedate=6 August 2017|df=dmy-all}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://drdo.gov.in/drdo/English/index.jsp?pg=job_sc.jsp|title=DRDO Scientist Job \u2013 DRDO Scientist B recruitment- Scientist recruitment DRDO|accessdate=2 July 2015|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150810162300/http://www.drdo.gov.in/drdo/English/index.jsp?pg=job_sc.jsp|archivedate=10 August 2015|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\n==History==\n[[Image:Photograph1.JPG|right|thumb|105 mm light field gun prototype being shown by [[Ranjit Lal Jetley|Gen Jetley]] to then Defence Minister [[Jagjivan Ram]]. ]]\n\nThe DRDO was established in 1958 by amalgamating the Defence Science Organisation and some of the technical development establishments. A separate Department of Defence Research and Development was formed in 1980 which later on administered DRDO and its 50 laboratories/establishments. Most of the time the Defence Research Development Organisation was treated as if it was a vendor and the Army Headquarters or the Air Headquarters were the customers. Because the Army and the Air Force themselves did not have any design or construction responsibility, they tended to treat the designer or Indian industry at par with their corresponding designer in the world market. If they could get a [[MiG-21]] from the world market, they wanted a MiG-21 from DRDO.<ref name=\"GS\">{{cite web |author=John Pike |url=http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/world/india/drdo.htm |title=Defence Research and Development Organisation (DRDO) |publisher=Globalsecurity.org |accessdate=31 August 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100423074603/http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/world/india/drdo.htm |archive-date=23 April 2010 |url-status=live }}</ref>\n\nDRDO started its first major project in [[surface-to-air missile]]s (SAM) known as [[Project Indigo]] in 1960s. Indigo was discontinued in later years without achieving full success. Project Indigo led to [[Project Devil]], along with Project Valiant, to develop short-range SAM and [[ICBM]] in the 1970s. Project Devil itself led to the later development of the [[Prithvi (missile)|Prithvi]] missile under the [[Integrated Guided Missile Development Programme]] (IGMDP) in the 1980s. IGMDP was an Indian [[Ministry of Defence (India)|Ministry of Defence]] programme between the early 1980s and 2007 for the development of a comprehensive range of missiles, including the [[Agni missile]], Prithvi ballistic missile, [[Akash missile]], [[Trishul missile]] and [[Nag Missile]]. In 2010, defence minister [[A. K. Antony]] ordered the restructuring of the DRDO to give 'a major boost to defence research in the country and to ensure effective participation of the private sector in defence technology'. The key measures to make DRDO effective in its functioning include the establishment of a Defence Technology Commission with the defence minister as its chairman.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.defencetalk.com/mod-announces-major-drdo-restructuring-plan-26384/ |title=MoD Announces Major DRDO Restructuring Plan &#124; Defence & Security News at DefenceTalk |publisher=Defencetalk.com |date=17 May 2010 |access-date=31 August 2010 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101129020637/http://www.defencetalk.com/mod-announces-major-drdo-restructuring-plan-26384/ |archivedate=29 November 2010 |df=dmy-all }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.defpro.com/news/details/15208/ |title=defence.professionals |publisher=defpro.com |accessdate=31 August 2010 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110515212759/http://www.defpro.com/news/details/15208/ |archivedate=15 May 2011 |df=dmy-all }}</ref> The programmes which were largely managed by DRDO have seen considerable success with many of the systems seeing rapid deployment as well as yielding significant technological benefits.

The DRDO's project has seen trials around fielding a long-range tactical strike system, moving on from the successful Pinaka project. The aim is to develop a long-range system able to strike at a range of 100\u2013120&nbsp;km, with each rocket in the system, having a payload of up to 250&nbsp;kg. The new MBRS's rocket will have a maximum speed of 4.7 mach and will rise to an altitude of 40&nbsp;km, before hitting its target at 1.8 mach. There is also a move to put a sophisticated new inertial guidance system on the rockets whilst keeping cost constraints in mind. The DRDO has evaluated the IMI-Elisra developed trajectory control system and its technology, for use with the Pinaka, and a further development of the system could presumably be used with the new MBRL as well.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.thehindubusinessline.com/2005/09/18/stories/2005091800620500.htm |title=Defence scientists plan artillery rockets with 100-km range |publisher=Hindu Business Line |date=18 September 2005 |access-date=31 August 2010 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100731023204/http://www.thehindubusinessline.com/2005/09/18/stories/2005091800620500.htm |archivedate=31 July 2010 |df=dmy-all }}</ref>\n* DRDO's ARDE developed 81&nbsp;mm and the,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://ofbindia.gov.in/products/data/ammunition/mb/11.htm |title=Ordnance Factory Board |publisher=Ofbindia.gov.in |accessdate=31 August 2010 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100730125943/http://ofbindia.gov.in/products/data/ammunition/mb/11.htm |archivedate=30 July 2010 |df=dmy-all }}</ref> 120&nbsp;mm illuminating bombs<ref>{{cite web |url=http://ofbindia.gov.in/products/data/ammunition/mb/14.htm |title=Ordnance Factory Board |publisher=Ofbindia.gov.in |access-date=31 August 2010 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100930004941/http://ofbindia.gov.in/products/data/ammunition/mb/14.htm |archivedate=30 September 2010 |df=dmy-all }}</ref> and 105&nbsp;mm illuminating shells<ref>{{cite web |url=http://ofbindia.gov.in/products/data/ammunition/lc/9.htm |title=Ordnance Factory Board |publisher=Ofbindia.gov.in |access-date=31 August 2010 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100730125246/http://ofbindia.gov.in/products/data/ammunition/lc/9.htm |archivedate=30 July 2010 |df=dmy-all }}</ref> for the [[Indian Army]]'s infantry and Artillery.\n* A 51&nbsp;mm Lightweight Infantry Platoon Mortar for the Indian Army.

The DRDO also noted that its new Radar Warner Jammer systems (RWJ) were at an advanced stage of development and would be submitted for trials. The RWJ is capable of detecting all foreseen threats and jamming multiple targets simultaneously.\n* Other EW projects revealed by the DRDO include the MAWS project (a joint venture by the DRDO and EADS) which leverages EADS hardware and DRDO software to develop MAWS systems for transport, helicopter and fighter fleets. DRDO also has laser warning systems available.\n* A [[DIRCM]] (Directed Infra Red Countermeasures) project to field a worldclass DIRCM system intended to protect aircraft from infrared [[guided weapons]].\n* The DRDO is also developing an all new ESM project in cooperation with the [[Indian Air Force]]'s Signals Intelligence Directorate, under the name of \"Divya Drishti\" (''Divine Sight''). Divya Drishti will field a range of static as well as mobile ESM stations that can \"fingerprint\"  and track multiple airborne targets for mission analysis purposes. The system will be able to intercept a range of radio frequency emissions like radar, navigational, communication or electronic countermeasure signals. The various components of the project will be networked via [[Communications satellite|SATCOM]] links.\n* Additional DRDO EW projects delivered to the Indian Air Force have included the COIN A and COIN B SIGINT stations. DRDO and BEL developed ELINT equipment for the Indian Air Force, installed on the service's Boeing 737s and Hawker Siddeley Avro aircraft. DRDO has also developed a Radar Fingerprinting System for the IAF and the Navy.\n* Another high accuracy ESM system is being developed by the DRDO for the [[DRDO AEW&CS|AEW&C]] project. The Indian Air Force's AEW&C systems will also include a comprehensive ESM suite, capable of picking up both radars as well as conducting [[COMINT|Communications Intelligence]].\n\n====Radars====\n\nThe DRDO has steadily increased its radar development. The result has been substantial progress in India's ability to design and manufacture high power radar systems with locally sourced components and systems. This began with the development of short-range 2D systems (Indra-1) and has now extended to high power 3D systems like LRTR intended for strategic purposes. Several other projects span the gamut of radar applications, from airborne surveillance ([[Airborne early warning and control|AEW&C]]) to firecontrol radars (land based and airborne).

This was the first high power radar developed by the DRDO, with the Indra-I radar for the Indian Army, followed by Indra Pulse Compression (PC) version for the Indian Air Force, also known as the Indra-II, which is a low level radar to search and track low flying cruise missiles, helicopters and aircraft. These are 2D radars that provide range and azimuth information and are meant to be used as gap fillers. The Indra 2 PC has pulse compression providing improved range resolution. The series is used both by the [[Indian Air Force]] and the [[Indian Army]]\n*[[File:Rajendra Radar.jpg|thumb|[[Rajendra Radar|Rajendra fire control radar]] at Adamya Chaitanya Exhibition 2016]][[Rajendra Radar|Rajendra fire control radar]] for the [[Akash missile|Akash SAM]]: The Rajendra is stated to be ready. However, it can be expected that further iterative improvements will be made. The Rajendra is a high power [[Passive electronically scanned array]] radar (PESA), with the ability able to guide up to 12 Akash SAMs against aircraft flying at low to medium altitudes. The Rajendra has a detection range of 80&nbsp; km with 18&nbsp; km height coverage against small fighter-sized targets and is able to track 64 targets, engaging 4 simultaneously, with up to 3 missiles per target. The Rajendra features a fully digital high-speed signal processing system with an adaptive moving target indicator, coherent signal processing, FFTs, and variable pulse repetition frequency. The entire PESA antenna array can swivel 360 degrees on a rotating platform. This allows the radar antenna to be rapidly repositioned and even conduct all-round surveillance.\n* [[Central Acquisition Radar (3D-CAR)|Central Acquisition Radar]], a state of the art planar array S-band radar operating on the stacked beam principle. With a range of 180&nbsp;km, it can [[track while scan]] 200 fighter-sized targets. Its systems are integrated on high mobility, locally built TATRA trucks for the Army and Air Force; however, it is meant to be used by all three services. Initially developed for the long-running Akash SAM system, seven were ordered by the Indian Air Force for their radar modernization program and two of another variants were ordered by the Indian Navy for their P-28 Corvettes.

This program was subsequently superseded by the advanced XV-2004 which offered a more sophisticated architecture able to handle SAR and ISAR modes. The SV-2000 is a lightweight, high performance, slotted array radar operating in the X-Band. It can detect sea-surface targets such as a periscope or a vessel against heavy clutter and can also be used for navigation, weather mapping, and beacon detection. The radar can detect a large vessel at over 100 nautical miles (370&nbsp; km). It is currently under modification to be fitted to the Advanced Light Helicopter and the Navy's Do-228's. Variants can be fitted to the Navy's Ka-25's as well. A more advanced variant of the Super Vision, known as the XV-2004 is now in trials and features an ISAR, SAR Capability intended for the Indian Navy's helicopter fleet.\n* [[Swordfish Long Range Tracking Radar]], a 3D AESA was developed with assistance from [[Elta]] of [[Israel]] and is similar to Elta's proven GreenPine long-range Active Array radar. The DRDO developed the signal processing and software for tracking high-speed ballistic missile targets as well as introduced more ruggedization. The radar uses mostly Indian designed and manufactured components such as its critical high power, L Band Transmit-Receive modules and other enabling technologies necessary for active phased array radars. The LRTR can track 200 targets and has a range of above 500&nbsp; km. It can detect [[Intermediate-range ballistic missile]]. The LRTR would be amongst the key elements of the [[Indian Ballistic Missile Defence Programme]]. DRDO would provide the technology to private and public manufacturers to make these high power systems.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.hindu.com/2005/04/15/stories/2005041509810400.htm |title=Details of LRTR from 2004 |publisher=Hindu.com |date=15 April 2005 |accessdate=31 August 2010 |location=Chennai, India |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100809122055/http://www.hindu.com/2005/04/15/stories/2005041509810400.htm |archivedate=9 August 2010 |df=dmy-all }}</ref>\n* 3D Multi-Function Control Radar (MFCR) was developed as part of the Indian anti-ballistic missile program in cooperation with [[Thales Group|THALES]] of France. The MFCR is an active phased array radar and complements the ''Swordfish Long Range Tracking Radar'', for intercepting ballistic missiles. The MFCR will also serve as the fire control radar for the AAD second-tier missile system of the ABM program. The AAD has a supplementary role against aircraft as well and can engage missiles and aircraft up to an altitude of 30&nbsp; km. The MFCR fills out the final part of the DRDO's radar development spectrum and allows India to manufacture long-range 3D radars that can act as the nodes of an Air Defence Ground Environment system.\n* 2D Low-Level Lightweight Radar (LLLWR) for the Indian Army, known as the Bharani, which requires many of these units for gap-filling in mountainous terrain and has been ordered into production after clearing Indian Army trials. The Indian Air Force will also acquire a more advanced unit, called the Aslesha. The LLLWR is a 2D radar with a range of 40&nbsp; km against a 2 square meter target, intended as a gap-filler to plug detection gaps versus low-level aircraft in an integrated Air Defence Ground network. The LLLWR makes use of Indra-2 technology, namely a similar antenna array, but has roughly half the range and is much smaller and a far more portable unit. The LLLWR can [[track while scan]] 100 targets and provide details about their speed, azimuth, and range to the operator. The LLLWR makes use of the BFSR-SR experience and many of the subsystem providers are the same. Multiple LLLWRs can be networked together. The LLLWR is meant to detect low-level intruders, and will alert Army Air Defence fire control units to cue their weapon systems.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://media.bharat-rakshak.com/aero/main.php?g2_itemId=1355 |title=LLLR Specifications |publisher=Media.bharat-rakshak.com |date=18 January 2007 |accessdate=31 August 2010 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071021103105/http://media.bharat-rakshak.com/aero/main.php?g2_itemId=1355 |archivedate=21 October 2007 |df=dmy }}</ref>\n* 3D Short-Range Radar for the Indian Air Force \u2013 ASLESHA: The ASLESHA radars have a range of approximately 50&nbsp; km against small fighter-sized targets and will be able to determine their range, speed, azimuth, and height. This radar will enable the Indian Air Force Air Defence units to accurately track low-level intruders. The radar is a semi-active phased array with a 1-meter square aperture. The DRDO was in discussions with the Indian Navy to mount these systems on small ships.\n* Multi-mode radar, a 3D radar is a HAL project with DRDO's LRDE as a subsystem provider. This project to develop an advanced, lightweight Multi-mode fire control radar for the [[LCA Tejas]] fighter had faced challenges and was delayed and finally superseded by a program called the Uttam to develop an AESA FCR for the Tejas LCA. The MMR program was finally completed with Elta's (Israel) assistance and became a hybrid system incorporating the original DRDO antenna, gimbal stabilization, and Israeli backend. The multi-mode radar has the range (for detection of a small fighter target) around 100&nbsp; km can track 10 targets, can engage 2 targets and uses the lightweight system. Originally, DRDO developed an all-new combined signal and the data processor had been developed, replacing the original separate units. The new unit is much more powerful and makes use of contemporary ADSP processors. The radar's critical hardware was also developed and validated. The software for the air-to-air mode has been developed considerably (including search and track while scan in both look up and look down modes) but air-to-ground modes were still being worked upon and proved problematic. The radar development was shown to be considerably more mature than previously thought but still faced significant delays and challenges. At Aero India 2009, it was revealed that the 3D MMR project has been superseded by the new 3D AESA FCR project led by LRDE. The MMR has been completed with Elta Israel's assistance and now involved [[Elta]] [[EL/M-2032]] technology for Air-to-Ground mapping and targeting \u2013 in order to simplify testing, the Hybrid MMR basically became an Indian variant of the EL/M-2032 with an Indian antenna and gimbal system as Elta pointed out mixing and matching Indian hardware with Israeli software would, in essence, mean a new design with a significant time impact. The \"hybrid\" MMR has been tested, validated and will be supplied for the initial [[LCA Tejas]] fighters.\n* DRDO has indigenized components and improved subsystems of various other license-produced radars manufactured at [[Bharat Electronics Limited|BEL]] with the help of BEL scientists and other researchers. These improvements include new radar data processors for license-produced signal radars as well as local radar assemblies replacing the earlier imported ones.\n* [[BEL Weapon Locating Radar]]:[[File:Weapon Locating Radar (Swathi) passes through the Rajpath, on the occasion of the 69th Republic Day Parade 2018, in New Delhi on January 26, 2018.jpg|thumb|BEL Weapon Locating Radar (Swathi) passes on the occasion of the 69th Republic Day Parade 2018.]]Swati, a 3D radar developed from the Rajendra fire-control radar for the Akash system, uses a [[passive electronically scanned array]] to detect multiple targets for fire correction and weapon location.

The Indian Army has ordered 28 of these units. \n* 3D Tactical Control Radar: a new program, the TCR is an approximately 90&nbsp; km ranged system for use by the Indian Army. A highly mobile unit, it is a variant of the 3D CAR unit and packaged into 2 as verses 3 units. The Indian Army has ordered many of the types for its Air Defense Units.\n\nApart from the above, the DRDO has also several other radar systems currently under development or in trials, these include:\n\n* Active Phased Array radar: a 3D radar for fighters, an MMR follow on, the APAR project aims to field a fully-fledged operational AESA fire control radar for the expected Mark-2 version of the [[Light Combat Aircraft]]. This will be the second airborne AESA program after the AEW&C project and intends to replicate DRDO's success with the ground-based radar segment to airborne systems. The overall airborne APAR program aims to prevent this technology gap from developing, with a broad-based program to bring DRDO up to par with international developers in airborne systems, both fire control, and surveillance. As of 2016, the radar was still in development, with variants expected to be fielded on future IAF fighters like the MCA or Tejas advanced Marks.\n* [[Synthetic aperture radar]] & [[Inverse synthetic aperture radar]]: the DRDO's LRDE is currently working on both SAR and ISAR radars for target detection and classification. These lightweight payloads are intended for both conventional fixed wing as well as [[Unmanned Aerial Vehicle|UAV]] applications.\n* Airborne Warning and Control: a new radar-based on [[active electronically scanned array]] technology. The aim of the project is to develop an in-house capability for high power AEW&C systems, with the system covering the development of an S-Band AESA array. The aircraft will also have data-links to link fighters plus communicate with the IAF's C3I infrastructure as well as a local SATCOM (satellite communication system), along with other onboard ESM and COMINT systems.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.blonnet.com/2006/01/25/stories/2006012501641500.htm |title=Aircraft for AWACS to be chosen by the IAF |publisher=Blonnet.com |date=25 January 2006 |accessdate=31 August 2010 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100813033613/http://www.blonnet.com/2006/01/25/stories/2006012501641500.htm |archivedate=13 August 2010 |df=dmy-all }}</ref> As of 2016, the system was in advanced trials and had achieved a TRL (Technical Readiness Level) of 8/10 with trials focusing on proving its self-protection equipment.\n* Medium-Range Battlefield Surveillance Radar: in 2009, the LRDE (DRDO) noted that it was working on a ''Long-range'' battlefield surveillance radar. It is possible that the BFSR-LR project has replaced this earlier project and the [[Indian Army]] will utilize the BEL built [[ELTA]] designed BFSR-MR's for Medium-Range surveillance while using the LRDE designed systems for Long Range surveillance. The 2D radar was to track ground targets and provide key intelligence to the Indian Army's artillery units, with the resultant information available on various tactical networks. As of 2016, this project was not active.\n* 3D Medium Power Radar: a spin-off of the experience gained via the 3D MFCR project, the 3D Medium Power Radar project is intended to field a radar with a range of approximately 300&nbsp; km against small fighter-sized targets. Intended for the Indian Air Force, the radar is an active phased array, and will be transportable. It will play a significant role being used as part of the nodes of the [[Indian Air Force]]'s enhanced Air Defence Ground Environment System. As of 2016, the radar was ready for IAF user trials and the IAF had ordered 8 MPRs already.\n* 3D Low-Level Transportable Radar: A new program, the LLTR is also called the Ashwini and is an approximately 200\u2013150&nbsp; km ranged system for use by the Indian  Air Force. A highly mobile unit, it will also employ AESA technology, and [[open architecture]] to provide easy upgrades and a variety of modes and capabilities depending on the software fit. The aim of the 3D Medium Power Radar and LLTR is to offer systems that can be deployed in a variety of roles, from fire control to surveillance, and not be tied to one role alone. As of 2016, the LLTR program was in an advanced stage and expected to reach the trials phase\n* 3D Army AD Fire Control Radar: A new program for the Indian Army, the Atulya FCR is intended to provide Army AD units with a compact fire control system for their armament. The Indian Army has a total requirement of over 60 FCRs.\n* 3D Army Multi-Mission Radar: A new program for the Indian Army, the mobile compact radar system is expected to be capable of both artillery detection and air defense missions. As of 2016, it was in an advanced stage of development, with basic design completed and realization of the prototype underway.\n\n====Command and control software and decision-making tools====\n* Tactical tools for wargaming: Shatranj and Sangram for the Army, Sagar for the Navy and air war software for the Air Force. All these systems are operational with the respective services.\n* C3I systems: DRDO, in cooperation with BEL and private industry has developed several critical C3I (command, control, communications and intelligence systems) for the armed services. Under the project \"Shakti\", the Indian Army aims to spend {{USD}}300 million to network all its artillery guns using the ACCS (Artillery Command and Control System). Developed by DRDO's Centre for Artificial Intelligence & Robotics, the system comprises computers and intelligent terminals connected as a wide area network. Its main subsystems are the artillery computer centre, battery computer, remote access terminal and a gun display unit. The ACCS is expected to improve the Army's artillery operations by a factor of 10 and allowing for more rapid and accurate firepower. The ACCS will also improve the ability of commanders to concentrate that fire-power where it is most needed. The DRDO and BEL have also developed a Battle Management system for the [[Indian Army]] for its tanks and tactical units.\n\nOther programmes in development for the Army include Corps level information and decision making software and tools, intended to link all units together for effective C3I. These systems are in production at DRDO's production partner, [[Bharat Electronics]]. These projects are being driven by the [[Indian Army Corps of Signals]]. The Indian Army is also moving towards extensive use of battlefield computers. DRDO has also delivered projects such as the Combat Net Radio for enhancing the Army's communication hardware.\n* Data management and command and control systems for the Navy have been provided by the DRDO. The Navy is currently engaged in a naval networking project to network all its ships and shore establishments plus maritime patrol aircraft and sensors.\n* Radar netting and multi-sensor fusion software for linking the Indian Air Force's network of radars and airbases which have been operationalised. Other systems include sophisticated and highly complex ''mission planning and C3I systems'' for missiles, such as the Agni and Prithvi ballistic missiles and the Brahmos cruise missile. These systems are common to all three services as all of them utilise different variants of these missiles.\n* Simulators and training tools: DRDO and private industry have collaborated on manufacturing a range of simulators and training devices for the three services, from entry level tests for prospective entrants to the Indian Air Force, to sophisticated simulators for fighter aircraft, transports and helicopters, tanks and gunnery devices.\n\n====Computing technologies====\n\nDRDO has worked extensively on high speed computing given its ramifications for most of its defence projects. These include supercomputers for computational flow dynamics, to dedicated microprocessor designs manufactured in India for flight controllers and the like, to high speed computing boards built around Commercial Off The Shelf (COTS) components, similar to the latest trends in the defence industry.\n* Supercomputing: DRDO's ANURAG developed the PACE+<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.hpcwire.com/archives/5465.html |title=Report from 1995 on the initial PACE system |publisher=Hpcwire.com |date=4 May 1995 |accessdate=31 August 2010 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100809225656/http://www.hpcwire.com/archives/5465.html |archivedate=9 August 2010 |df=dmy-all }}</ref> Supercomputer for strategic purposes for supporting its various programmes. The initial version, as detailed in 1995, had the following specifications: The system delivered a sustained performance of more than 960 Mflops (million floating operations per second) for computational [[fluid dynamics]] programmes. Pace-Plus included 32 advanced computing nodes, each with 64 megabytes(MB) of memory that can be expanded up to 256MB and a powerful front-end processor which is a [[hyperSPARC]] with a speed of 66/90/100 megahertz (MHz). Besides fluid dynamics, these high-speed computer systems were used in areas such as vision, medical imaging, signal processing, molecular modeling, neural networks and finite element analysis. The latest variant of the PACE series is the PACE ++, a 128 node parallel processing system. With a front-end processor, it has a distributed memory and message passing system. Under Project '''Chitra''', the DRDO is implementing a system with a computational speed of 2-3 Teraflops utilising commercial off the shelf components and the Open Source Linux Operating System.\n* Processors and other critical items: DRDO has developed a range of processors and application specific integrated circuits for its critical projects. Many of these systems are modular, in the sense that they can be reused across different projects. These include \"Pythagoras processor\" to convert cartesian to polar coordinates, ANUCO, a floating point coprocessor and several others, including the ANUPAMA 32-bit processor, which is being used in several DRDO projects.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.electronicsforu.com/electronicsforu/articles/hits.asp?id=1106 |title=ANUPAMA processor |publisher=Electronicsforu.com |accessdate=31 August 2010}}</ref>\n* Electronic components: one of the endeavours undertaken by the DRDO has been to create a substantial local design and development capability within India, both in the private and public sectors. This policy has led to several hard to obtain or otherwise denied items, being designed and manufactured in India. These include components such as radar subsystems (product specific travelling wave tubes) to components necessary for electronic warfare and other cutting edge projects. Today, there are a range of firms across India, which design and manufacture key components for DRDO, allowing it to source locally for quite a substantial chunk of its procurement. The DRDO has also endeavoured to use COTS (Commercial off the shelf) processors and technology, and follow Open Architecture standards, wherever possible, in order to pre-empt obsolescence issues and follow industry practise. One significant example is the development of an Open Architecture computer for the Light Combat Aircraft, based on the PowerPC architecture and VME64 standard. Variants of the earlier Mission computer utilising Intel 486 DX chips are already present on the Su-30 MKI, Jaguar and MiG-27 Upgrades for the Indian Air Force.\n\n====Laser Science & Technology Centre (LASTEC)====\nDRDO is working on a slew of directed energy weapons (DEWs). LASTEC has identified DEWs, along with space security, cyber-security and hypersonic vehicles as focus areas in the next 15 years.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/DRDOs-next-Star-Wars-like-weapons/articleshow/6248942.cms#ixzz3qGVfeigT|title=DRDO's next: Star Wars-like weapons|publisher=The Times of India|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151020161307/http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/DRDOs-next-Star-Wars-like-weapons/articleshow/6248942.cms#ixzz3qGVfeigT|archivedate=20 October 2015|df=dmy-all}}</ref> The aim is to develop laser-based weapons, deployed on airborne as well as seaborne platforms, which can intercept missiles soon after they are launched towards India in the boost phase itself. These will be part of the ballistic missile defence system being currently developed by DRDO. LASTEC is developing a 25-kilowatt laser system to hit a missile during its terminal phase at a distance of 5\u20137&nbsp;km. LASTEC is also working on a vehicle-mounted gas dynamic laser-based DEW system, under project Aditya, which should be ready in three years. Project Aditya is a technology demonstrator to prove beam control technology. Ultimately, solid-state lasers would be used. For US President [[Donald Trump]] visit to India in 2020, DRDO deployed the LASTEC developed vehicle-mounted gas dynamic laser-based DEW system for counter-drone operations in [[Ahmedabad]] after completion of successful trial on February 21, 2020.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.livemint.com/news/india/how-this-drdo-made-weapon-will-safeguard-skies-during-trump-modi-s-roadshow-11582286736993.html|title=How this DRDO-made weapon will safeguard skies during Trump-Modi's roadshow|date=2020-02-21|website=Livemint|language=en|access-date=2020-03-06}}</ref> It can detect, identify and destroy low flying objects of smaller size carrying explosives or arms and ammunitions.

Local systems include the DRDO-developed [[Reactive armour|ERA]], a DRDO-developed laser warning system and combat net radio, the Bharat Electronics Limited advanced land navigation system consisting of fibre optic gyros and GPS, [[Weapon of mass destruction|NBC]] protection and DRDO's fire detection and suppression system amongst other items. Imported systems include a compact [[Thermographic camera|thermal imager]] and fire control system and a new 1000&nbsp;hp engine.\n* Anti-tank ammunition: DRDO developed the [[Kinetic energy penetrator|FSAPDS]] for the 125&nbsp;mm calibre, meant for India's T-72 tanks, the 120&nbsp;mm [[Kinetic energy penetrator|FSAPDS]] and [[High explosive squash head|HESH]] rounds for the [[Arjun MBT|Arjun tank]] and 105&nbsp;mm [[Kinetic energy penetrator|FSAPDS]] rounds for the Army's [[Vijayanta]] and [[T-55]] tanks. Significant amounts of 125&nbsp;mm anti-tank rounds manufactured by the Ordnance Factory Board were rejected. The problems were traced to improper packaging of the charges by the OFB, leading to propellant leakage during storage at high temperatures. The locally developed rounds were rectified and requalified. Production of these local rounds was then restarted. Since 2001, over {{formatnum:130000}} rounds have been manufactured by the OFB. The DRDO said in 2005 that it had developed a Mk2 version of the 125&nbsp;mm round, with higher power propellant for greater penetration. In parallel, the OFB announced in 2006 that it was also manufacturing 125&nbsp;mm IMI ([[Israel Military Industries]]) rounds. It is believed that this might assist in improving the OFB's APFSDS manufacturing capability. These rounds and presumably the Mk2 round and will be used by both the [[T-72]] and [[T-90]] formations in the [[Indian Army]].<ref>{{cite web |author=Press Trust of India / New Delhi&nbsp;3 October 2005 |url=http://www.business-standard.com/bsonline/storypage.php?autono=219530 |title=OFB manufacturing new 125 mm round from IMI |publisher=Business-standard.com |date=3 October 2005 |access-date=31 August 2010 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100729034307/http://www.business-standard.com/bsonline/storypage.php?autono=219530 |archivedate=29 July 2010 |df=dmy-all }}</ref><ref>[http://mod.nic.in/reports/MOD-English2006.pdf MOD Annual Report from 2006 with details on new DRDO projects delivered, including new 125 mm MK2 FSAPDS] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927013233/http://mod.nic.in/reports/MOD-English2006.pdf |date=27 September 2007 }} [PDF File]</ref>\n* Various armour technologies and associated subsystems from [[composite armour]] and [[explosive reactive armour]] to ''Radios'' (Combat Net Radio with frequency hopping and encryption) and Battle Management systems.

The Army will deploy the Nag on ground-based launchers and from helicopters, whereas the Air Force will rely on helicopter based units. The Nag has an Imaging Infrared (IIR) seeker and has a top and direct attack capability, with a tandem warhead. The Army's land missile carrier and launcher, known as the Namica, carries several ready to use Nag missiles within and four Nag missiles in an extendable launcher above the turret. The Namica has its own FLIR based sighting and fire control unit.\n\n[[File:Nag with NAMICA Defexpo-2008.JPG|thumb|[[Nag missile]]]]\n\nThe Air Force and Army will also use their Advanced Light helicopters (ALH) ([[HAL Dhruv]]) and the [[HAL Light Combat Helicopter]] (LHC) as Nag carriers. The ALHs will be equipped with IRDE (DRDO) developed HELITIS (Heliborne Imaging and Targeting systems) with a combination of a FLIR and laser range finder in a stabilised turret for target acquisition and designation. The thermal imager is likely to be imported, but the gimballed turret, stabilisation, laser range finder and associated electronics have been designed in India and will be manufactured locally. The Nag ATGM is regarded as a highly capable missile, even though its development has been protracted, mainly due to the technological challenges of developing a state of the art IIR sensor equipped top attack missile. The Nag is still cheaper than most imported missiles in its category and is earmarked for the Army and Air Force.\n\nThe Nag anti-tank guided missile was cleared for production in July 2009 and there are uncorroborated reports since that it may be purchased by [[Tanzania]], [[Botswana]] and [[Morocco]].<ref name=\"export\">{{cite news|title=India seeks to boost military exports to Gulf|url=http://www.siliconindia.com/shownews/India_seeks_to_boost_military_exports_to_Gulf___-nid-18916.html|author=IANS|publisher=SiliconIndia.com|authorlink=Indo-Asian News Service|date=20 March 2003|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110511105844/http://www.siliconindia.com/shownews/India_seeks_to_boost_military_exports_to_Gulf___-nid-18916.html|archivedate=11 May 2011|df=dmy-all}}</ref> The Nag will complement the existing Russian [[9M113 Konkurs|9M113 Konkurs Anti-tank guided missile]] and European missile [[MILAN]] in Indian usage, both of which are manufactured under licence by Bharat Dynamics Limited.\n\n====Brahmos====\n{{main|BrahMos}}\n\nLaunched as a joint venture between India's DRDO and the Russian NPO, the BrahMos programme aims at creating a range of missile systems derived from the [[Yakhont]] missile system.

Similar to the BrahMos, Shaurya is stored in composite canisters, which makes it much easier to store for long periods without maintenance as well as to handle and transport. It also houses the gas generator to eject the missile from the canister before its solid propellant motors take over to hurl it at the intended target.\n\nShaurya missiles can remain hidden or camouflaged in underground silos from enemy surveillance or satellites till they are fired from the special storage-cum-launch canisters. The Shaurya system will require some more tests before it becomes fully operational in two to three years. Moreover, defence scientists say the high-speed, two-stage Shaurya has high maneuverability which also makes it less vulnerable to existing anti-missile defence systems.\n\nIt can be easily transported by road. The missile, encased in a canister, is mounted on a single vehicle, which has only a driver's cabin, and the vehicle itself is the launch platform. This \"single vehicle solution\" reduces its signature \u2013 it cannot be easily detected by satellites \u2013 and makes its deployment easy. The gas generator, located at the bottom of the canister produces high pressure gas, which expands and ejects the missile from the tube.\n\nThe centrepiece of a host of new technologies incorporated in Shaurya is its [[ring laser gyroscope]] (RLG) and [[accelerometer]]. The indigenous ring laser gyroscope, a sophisticated navigation and guidance system developed by the Research Centre Imarat (RCI) based in Hyderabad is a highly classified technology.\n\nIn test flights the RLG functioned exceptionally well. the RLG monitors the missile's position in space when it is flying. The missile's on-board computer will use this information and compare it with the desired position. Based on the difference between the missile's actual and desired positions, the computer will decide the optimum path and the actuators will command the missile to fly in its desired/targeted position.\nThe third test of the RLG was successful on 24 September 2011, reaching a speed of 7.5 mach. It is now ready for production.\n\n====Sagarika====\n{{main|Sagarika (missile)}}\n\nThe K-15 Sagarika is a nuclear-capable submarine-launched ballistic missile belonging to the [[K Missile family]] with a range of 750 kilometres (466&nbsp;mi). Sagarika can carry a payload of up to 500 kilograms (1,102&nbsp;lb). Sagarika was developed at the DRDO's missile complex in Hyderabad.\n\nThis missile will form part of the triad in India's nuclear deterrence, and will provide retaliatory nuclear strike capability. The development of this missile (under the title Project K-15) started in 1991. The Indian government first confirmed Sagarika's development seven years later (1998), when the then Defence Minister, George Fernandes, announced it during a press conference.\n\nThe development of the underwater missile launcher, known as Project 420 (P420), was completed in 2001 and handed over to the Indian Navy for trials. The missile was successfully test-fired six times, and tested to its full range up to three times. The test of missile from a submerged pontoon was conducted in February 2008.\n\nSagarika is being integrated with India's nuclear-powered [[Arihant class submarine]]s that began sea trials on 26 July 2009.\n\n====Prahaar====\n{{Main|Prahaar (missile)}}\n\nPrahaar is a solid-fueled surface-to-surface guided short-range tactical ballistic missile developed by DRDO of India.

While DRDO had revealed some details about the project over the years, its progress had been marked by strict secrecy, and the project itself was unlisted, and not visible among DRDO's other programmes. The ABM project has benefited from all the incremental improvements achieved by the DRDO and its associated industrial partners via the long-running and often contentious [[Akash missile]] and [[Trishul (missile)|Trishul]] missile programmes. However, it is a completely new programme, with much larger scope and with predominantly new subsystems.\n\nThe ABM project has two missiles\u2014namely the AAD (Advanced Air Defence) and PAD (Prithvi Air Defence) missiles. The former is an endo-atmospheric interceptor of new design, which can intercept targets to a height of {{convert|30|km|0|abbr=on}}. Whereas the latter is a modified Prithvi missile, dubbed the Axo-atmospheric interceptor (AXO) with a dedicated second stage kill vehicle for ballistic missile interception, up to an altitude of {{convert|80|km|0|abbr=on}}. Both these missiles are cued by an active phased array Long Range Tracking Radar, similar to the Elta GreenPine but made with locally developed components, which include DRDO-developed transmit/receive modules. The ABM system also makes use of a second radar, known as the Multi-Function Control Radar which assists the LRTR in classifying the target, and can also act as the fire control radar for the AAD missile. The MFCR, like the LRTR, is an active phased array system.\n\nThe entire system was tested in November 2006, under the Prithvi Air Defence Exercise, when a prototype AXO missile intercepted another [[Prithvi missile]] at a height of {{convert|50|km|0|abbr=on}}. This test was preceded by an \"electronic test\" in which an actual target missile was launched, but the entire interceptor system was tested electronically, albeit no actual interceptor was launched. This test was successful in its entirety. The AAD Missile was tested on December 2007 which successfully intercepted a modified Prithvi missile simulating the [[M9 Anti-tank Rocket Launcher|M-9]] and [[M-11 Shtorm|M-11]] class of ballistic missiles.

The increased production of sebum can lead to a blockage of the sebaceous gland duct. This can cause a [[comedo]], (commonly called a ''blackhead'' or a ''whitehead''), which can lead to infection, particularly by the bacteria ''[[Cutibacterium acnes]]''. This can [[inflammation|inflame]] the comedones, which then change into the characteristic acne lesions. ''[[Comedo]]nes'' generally occur on the areas with more sebaceous glands, particularly the face, shoulders, upper chest and back. Comedones may be \"black\" or \"white\" depending on whether the entire pilosebaceous unit, or just the sebaceous duct, is blocked.<ref name=DAVIDSONS2010>{{cite book|last=Britton|first=the editors Nicki R.

Containment is undertaken in the early stages of the outbreak and aims to trace and isolate those infected as well as introduce other measures of infection control and vaccinations to stop the disease from spreading to the rest of the population. When it is no longer possible to contain the spread of the disease, efforts then move to the mitigation stage: measures are taken to slow the spread and mitigate its effects on the healthcare system and society. A combination of both containment and mitigation measures may be undertaken at the same time.<ref name=\"NY0JD\" /> Suppression requires more extreme measures so as to reverse the pandemic by reducing the [[basic reproduction number]] to less than 1.<ref name=\"ImpCollege16mar2020\" />\n\nPart of managing an infectious disease outbreak is trying to decrease the epidemic peak, known as flattening the epidemic curve.<ref name=\"Lancet2020Flatten\" /> This decreases the risk of health services being overwhelmed and provides more time for vaccines and treatments to be developed.<ref name=\"Lancet2020Flatten\" /> Non-pharmaceutical interventions that may manage the outbreak include personal preventive measures, such as hand hygiene, wearing face-masks, and self-quarantine; community measures aimed at physical distancing such as closing schools and cancelling mass gathering events; community engagement to encourage acceptance and participation in such interventions; as well as environmental measures such surface cleaning.<ref name=\"community mitigation\" />\n\nMore drastic actions aimed at containing the outbreak were taken in China once the severity of the outbreak became apparent, such as quarantining entire cities and imposing strict travel bans.<ref name=\"RwmYm\" /> Other countries also adopted a variety of measures aimed at limiting the spread of the virus. South Korea introduced mass screening and localized quarantines, and issued alerts on the movements of infected individuals. Singapore provided financial support for those infected who quarantined themselves and imposed large fines for those who failed to do so. Taiwan increased face mask production and penalized hoarding of medical supplies.<ref name=\"shZdf\" />\n\nSimulations for Great Britain and the United States show that mitigation (slowing but not stopping epidemic spread) and suppression (reversing epidemic growth) have major challenges.<!--ref name=ImpCollege16mar2020--> Optimal mitigation policies might reduce peak healthcare demand by 2/3 and deaths by half, but still result in hundreds of thousands of deaths and health systems being overwhelmed.<!--ref name=ImpCollege16mar2020--> Suppression can be preferred but needs to be maintained for as long as the virus is circulating in the human population (or until a vaccine becomes available, if that comes first), as transmission otherwise quickly rebounds when measures are relaxed.

Containment is undertaken in the early stages of the outbreak and aims to trace and isolate those infected as well as introduce other measures of infection control and vaccinations to stop the disease from spreading to the rest of the population. When it is no longer possible to contain the spread of the disease, efforts then move to the mitigation stage: measures are taken to slow the spread and mitigate its effects on the healthcare system and society. A combination of both containment and mitigation measures may be undertaken at the same time.<ref name=\"NY0JD\" /> Suppression requires more extreme measures so as to reverse the pandemic by reducing the [[basic reproduction number]] to less than 1.<ref name=\"ImpCollege16mar2020\" />\n\nPart of managing an infectious disease outbreak is trying to decrease the epidemic peak, known as flattening the epidemic curve.<ref name=\"Lancet2020Flatten\" /> This decreases the risk of health services being overwhelmed and provides more time for vaccines and treatments to be developed.<ref name=\"Lancet2020Flatten\" /> Non-pharmaceutical interventions that may manage the outbreak include personal preventive measures, such as hand hygiene, wearing face-masks, and self-quarantine; community measures aimed at physical distancing such as closing schools and cancelling mass gathering events; community engagement to encourage acceptance and participation in such interventions; as well as environmental measures such surface cleaning.<ref name=\"community mitigation\" />\n\nMore drastic actions aimed at containing the outbreak were taken in China once the severity of the outbreak became apparent, such as quarantining entire cities and imposing strict travel bans.<ref name=\"RwmYm\" /> Other countries also adopted a variety of measures aimed at limiting the spread of the virus. South Korea introduced mass screening and localized quarantines, and issued alerts on the movements of infected individuals. Singapore provided financial support for those infected who quarantined themselves and imposed large fines for those who failed to do so. Taiwan increased face mask production and penalized hoarding of medical supplies.<ref name=\"shZdf\" />\n\nSimulations for Great Britain and the United States show that mitigation (slowing but not stopping epidemic spread) and suppression (reversing epidemic growth) have major challenges.<!--ref name=ImpCollege16mar2020--> Optimal mitigation policies might reduce peak healthcare demand by 2/3 and deaths by half, but still result in hundreds of thousands of deaths and health systems being overwhelmed.<!--ref name=ImpCollege16mar2020--> Suppression can be preferred but needs to be maintained for as long as the virus is circulating in the human population (or until a vaccine becomes available, if that comes first), as transmission otherwise quickly rebounds when measures are relaxed.

(formerly '''Angel Studios, Inc.''') is an American [[video game developer]] and a studio of [[Rockstar Games]] based in [[Carlsbad, California]]. Founded by [[Colombians|Colombian]] artist and businessman Diego Angel in 1984, the company initially focused on animations and [[visual effects]] for multimedia productions, including films and [[music video]]s. Following Angel's business strategy of avoiding high-risk business sectors, the company began working in the [[video game industry]] during the 1990s. Its first video game projects were [[Ed Annunziata]]'s ''[[Ecco: The Tides of Time]]'' (1994) and ''[[Mr. Bones (video game)|Mr. Bones]]'' (1996), for which Angel Studios created [[cutscene]]s.\n\nThe company developed its own games in association with [[Nintendo]] (''[[Major League Baseball Featuring Ken Griffey Jr.]]'' and ''[[Ken Griffey Jr.'s Slugfest]]'') and [[Microsoft]] (''[[Midtown Madness]]'' and ''[[Midtown Madness 2]]''), and produced a [[Porting|port]] of [[Capcom]]'s ''[[Resident Evil 2]]'' for the [[Nintendo 64]]. Impressed with the studio's work on ''Midtown Madness'', Rockstar Games approached Angel Studios with a long-term partnership in 1999, which resulted in the creation of video game series ''[[Midnight Club]]'' and ''[[Smuggler's Run]]''.\n\nIn November 2002, Angel Studios was acquired by [[Take-Two Interactive]] (Rockstar Games' parent company) and became part of Rockstar Games as Rockstar San Diego. Since 2004, Rockstar San Diego has housed an internal [[game engine]] team that develops the [[Rockstar Advanced Game Engine]] (RAGE), Rockstar Games' proprietary engine used in most titles developed by its studios for [[personal computer]]s and [[Video game console|consoles]].

(formerly '''Angel Studios, Inc.''') is an American [[video game developer]] and a studio of [[Rockstar Games]] based in [[Carlsbad, California]]. Founded by [[Colombians|Colombian]] artist and businessman Diego Angel in 1984, the company initially focused on animations and [[visual effects]] for multimedia productions, including films and [[music video]]s. Following Angel's business strategy of avoiding high-risk business sectors, the company began working in the [[video game industry]] during the 1990s. Its first video game projects were [[Ed Annunziata]]'s ''[[Ecco: The Tides of Time]]'' (1994) and ''[[Mr. Bones (video game)|Mr. Bones]]'' (1996), for which Angel Studios created [[cutscene]]s.\n\nThe company developed its own games in association with [[Nintendo]] (''[[Major League Baseball Featuring Ken Griffey Jr.]]'' and ''[[Ken Griffey Jr.'s Slugfest]]'') and [[Microsoft]] (''[[Midtown Madness]]'' and ''[[Midtown Madness 2]]''), and produced a [[Porting|port]] of [[Capcom]]'s ''[[Resident Evil 2]]'' for the [[Nintendo 64]]. Impressed with the studio's work on ''Midtown Madness'', Rockstar Games approached Angel Studios with a long-term partnership in 1999, which resulted in the creation of video game series ''[[Midnight Club]]'' and ''[[Smuggler's Run]]''.\n\nIn November 2002, Angel Studios was acquired by [[Take-Two Interactive]] (Rockstar Games' parent company) and became part of Rockstar Games as Rockstar San Diego. Since 2004, Rockstar San Diego has housed an internal [[game engine]] team that develops the [[Rockstar Advanced Game Engine]] (RAGE), Rockstar Games' proprietary engine used in most titles developed by its studios for [[personal computer]]s and [[Video game console|consoles]]. Rockstar San Diego led development of the 2010 game ''[[Red Dead Redemption]]'' and its [[expansion pack]] ''[[Undead Nightmare]]'', and collaborated with other Rockstar Games studios on ''[[Max Payne 3]]'' (2012), ''[[Grand Theft Auto V]]'' (2013), and ''[[Red Dead Redemption 2]]'' (2018).\n\n== History ==\n\n=== Beginnings, partnerships, and ''Resident Evil 2'' port (1984\u20132000) ===\n<!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Diego Angel.jpg|thumb|left|Diego Angel founded Angel Studios in 1984 and served as its [[President (corporate title)|president]] until 2005.<ref name=\"San Diego U-T: Before the bubble\" /><ref name=\"Polygon: How\" />]] -->\nColombian artist and businessman Diego Angel founded Angel Studios in 1984 in [[Carlsbad, California]], as a [[work-for-hire]] studio that created [[3D computer graphics|3D graphics]].<ref name=\"San Diego U-T: Before the bubble\" /><ref name=\"Polygon: How\" /> Founding partners included Brad Hunt, Michael Limber, and Angel's [[brother-in-law]], of whom Limber became the company's [[chief creative officer]].<ref name=\"Playing at the Next Level\" /><ref name=\"VentureBeat: CCO\" /> Angel employed a philosophy he called the \"three P's\" (passion, patience, and perseverance), which meant that he would not accept any offer simply because it came his way; instead, he opted for projects that showcased his team and their technology.<ref name=\"Polygon: How\" /> According to Angel Studios employees, Angel treated them like family, paying them well, giving them plenty of vacation time, and sharing a bottle of [[Patr\u00f3n]] [[tequila]] with them at the \"Sippy Wippy\" he occasionally held on Friday afternoons.<ref name=\"Polygon: How\" /><ref name=\"Polygon: Agent\" /> Much of the 3D work produced by Angel Studios were films and [[music video]]s.<ref name=\"Polygon: How\" /><ref name=\"Igromania: World Fame\" /> It was most successful with the [[computer-generated imagery]] and [[visual effects]] in the film ''[[The Lawnmower Man (film)|The Lawnmower Man]]'' and the music video for [[Peter Gabriel]]'s \"Kiss That Frog\", both released in 1992.<ref name=\"Polygon: How\" /><ref name=\"Destructoid: Pixel\" /><ref name=\"Game Informer: Unlikely Movie Games\" /> The video for \"Kiss That Frog\" received the Best Special Effects in a Video award at the [[1994 MTV Video Music Awards]].<ref name=\"Polygon: How\" /><ref name=\"The Free Library: Dream Team\" /> For ''The Lawnmower Man'', Angel Studios produced two major scenes; one has been considered the first virtual [[sex scene]].<ref name=\"The Washington Post: Lawnmower Man\" /><ref name=\"CU Amiga: Lawnmower Man\" /> Angel Studios' team for ''The Lawnmower Man''\u2014consisting of leader Hunt, Limber, and Jill Knighton Hunt\u2014developed Scenix, a set of software providing a \"visual [[programming language]]\".<ref name=\"ACE: Scenix\" /> The team also developed an algorithm with which they could visually transform a [[jet fighter]] into a [[dolphin]] with just a few tweaks.<ref name=\"Wired: Dollar a Minute\" /> For ''The Enertopia Symphony'', a [[short film]] of thirteen minutes shown at the Electric Energy Pavilion at [[Expo '93]], Angel Studios produced a 6.5-minute [[Stereoscopy|stereoscopic animation]] from live-action 3-D photography directed by [[Peter Anderson (cinematographer)|Peter Anderson]].<ref name=\"3-D Revolution\" /> In August 1993, the agency Spear/Hall & Associates acquired the marketing service rights for Angel Studios.<ref name=\"Adweek: Account acquisitions\" />\n\nDuring the early 1990s, Angel Studios cooperated with technology company [[Silicon Graphics]] to create demos for the latter's high-end computers in exchange for units of the computers.<ref name=\"Polygon: How\" /> One of Silicon Graphics' clients was [[Genyo Takeda]] of [[Nintendo]], who was impressed with Angel Studios' work.<ref name=\"Polygon: How\" /> Takeda requested an appointment with Angel Studios for the following day, and signed the company as a launch partner for the upcoming Nintendo Ultra 64 console (which later became the Nintendo 64) three days later.<ref name=\"Polygon: How\" /> Angel Studios then shifted its focus to the [[video game industry]], and was announced as joining Nintendo's \"Dream Team\" (a group of third-party companies that would develop video games for the Nintendo Ultra 64) in February 1995.<ref name=\"Polygon: How\" /><ref name=\"The Free Library: Dream Team\" /> According to Angel, he decided to stop seeking projects in fields in which the company had already succeeded if the field involved a \"high-risk, capital-intensive business\", even if it offered rich potential; this led him to approach the video game business.<ref name=\"San Diego U-T: Before the bubble\" /> Limber cited Angel's business model as the biggest factor in the company's survival of the [[dot-com bubble]], which severely impacted the [[San Diego County, California|San Diego-area]] multimedia industry.<ref name=\"San Diego U-T: Before the bubble\" /> Around this time, Angel Studios accepted game designer [[Ed Annunziata]]'s pitch to create [[cutscene]]s for the [[Sega CD]] version of ''[[Ecco: The Tides of Time]]''.<ref name=\"Playing at the Next Level\" /> Annunziata was pleased with the result and invited Angel Studios to work on cutscenes for his next game, ''[[Mr. Bones (video game)|Mr. Bones]]'', for the [[Sega Saturn]].<ref name=\"Playing at the Next Level\" /> ''Mr. Bones'' was released in 1996, with Angel Studios contributing the cutscenes and additional artwork.<ref name=\"Polygon: How\" /><ref name=\"Igromania: World Fame\" />\n\n{{Quote box |text=I was the only company in video games, the only [American] studio in those days, that was working and getting along with the Japanese.

it fit a game taking up two [[compact disc]]s (CDs) for the PlayStation version onto one Nintendo 64 [[ROM cartridge]], which offered less than 10 percent of the two CDs' combined disk space.<ref name=\"Gamasutra: Resident Evil 2\" /><ref name=\"Eurogamer: DF Retro\" /> In a 2018 [[retrospective]] on ''Resident Evil 2'' and its ports, ''[[Eurogamer]]''{{'s}} John Linneman called the conversion \"one of the most ambitious console ports of all time\".<ref name=\"Eurogamer: DF Retro\" /> In 1999, editors of ''[[IGN]]'' said that the port marked the studio as fit to develop Nintendo's recently announced Project Dolphin console (which later became the [[GameCube]]).<ref name=\"IGN: Sweet Dreams\" />\n\nAnother Angel Studios project was ''Ground Effect'', a [[hovercraft]] racing simulation game.<ref name=\"PC Powerplay: Ground Effect\" /> It was due to be published by [[Inscape (company)|Inscape]] before that company was acquired by Graphix Zone in February 1997.<ref name=\"CSoon: Graphix Zone\" /> In November 1997, ''Ground Effect'' had an intended release date of February 1998.<ref name=\"PC Powerplay: Ground Effect\" /> [[Expo '98]], at its Virtual Reality Pavilion, exhibited Angel Studios' ''Oceania'', described as a \"virtual journey\".<ref name=\"Publico: Oceania\" /> The June 1998 opening of the first [[DisneyQuest]] interactive [[theme park]] in [[Orlando, Florida]], debuted ''Virtual Jungle Cruise'', an adventure ride Angel Studios had contributed to.<ref name=\"IEEE: Magic Kingdom\" /> Interactive Light also published ''Savage Quest'', a [[beat 'em up]]-style [[arcade game]] developed by Angel Studios, in 1999.<ref name=\"Retro Gamer: Savage Quest\" /> Around this time, Angel proposed development of a [[racing video game]] title despite market saturation.<ref name=\"San Diego U-T: Before the bubble\" /> He decided that his employees should work on their own and find their own ways to produce a full-fledged video game, said to have been a major factor for the product's quality; some developed a sense of ownership of their respective parts.<ref name=\"Gamasutra: Scrum\" /> The game became ''[[Midtown Madness]]'', the May 1999 installment of [[Microsoft]]'s ''Madness'' line of racing titles.<ref name=\"GameSpot: Goes Gold\" /> Fred Marcus, a [[Video game designer|designer]] and [[Video game programmer|programmer]] on ''Midtown Madness'', stated that the studio's impressive [[Technology demonstration|physics demos]] were key to Angel Studios' publisher contracts.<ref name=\"Gamasutra: Physics\" /> The game spawned a three-title series, the second entry of which (''[[Midtown Madness 2]]'') was developed by Angel Studios and released in 2000.<ref name=\"Eurogamer: Midtown Madness\" /> Both titles' most-acclaimed elements were the detailed [[open-world]] environment, outstanding visual presentation and well-programmed [[artificial intelligence]].<ref name=\"GameSpot: Midtown Madness\" /><ref name=\"Gamasutra: AI Madness\" /> Angel Studios continued working with Microsoft on a game involving a [[Artificial human companion|virtual girlfriend]].<ref name=\"VentureBeat: CCO\" /><ref name=\"Siliconera: Interactive Xbox Girlfriend\" /> Known as ''XGirl'', the game was planned as a [[launch title]] for Microsoft's [[Xbox (console)|Xbox]] console but was canceled.<ref name=\"VentureBeat: CCO\" /><ref name=\"Siliconera: Interactive Xbox Girlfriend\" /> A game based on ''[[La Femme Nikita (TV series)|La Femme Nikita]]'' was also pitched but never realized.<ref name=\"Siliconera: Interactive Xbox Girlfriend\" /> ''Sky Pirates VR'', a pirate-themed attraction based on [[Steven Spielberg]]'s \"vertical reality\" system, was exhibited in [[GameWorks]] theme parks, starting with their [[Detroit]] location in 2000 and later expanding to other locations that used this system, including that in [[Schaumburg, Illinois]].<ref name=\"XVG: Sky Pirates VR\" /><ref name=\"Chicago Tribune: Sky Pirates VR\" />\n\n=== Rockstar Games deals and acquisition (2000\u20132006) ===\n[[File:Angel Studios Logo.png|thumb|right|alt=A halo and the words \"Angel\" and \"Studios\", the latter entirely in upper-case letters, aligned vertically and enclosed within a blue oval that has a black outline and a horizontally striped overlay|Angel Studios' logo from 2000 to 2002, designed by Michael Limber<ref name=\"Michael Limber: Brand-Web-Print\" />]]\nAmerican [[video game publisher]] [[Rockstar Games]] became interested in the studio after the release of ''Midtown Madness'', wanting to use their combined expertise to develop what became the ''[[Midnight Club]]'' and ''Smuggler's Run'' series.<ref name=\"IGN: Red Dead\" /> Angel Studios worked on a sequel to [[Bungie West]]'s 2001 game, ''[[Oni (video game)|Oni]]'', which was owned by Rockstar Games [[parent company]], [[Take-Two Interactive]].<ref name=\"Eurogamer: Oni 2\" /> Titled ''Oni 2: Death & Taxes'', the game's production was later halted.<ref name=\"Kotaku: Cult Classic\" /> In a November 2000 interview, Rockstar Games' [[Sam Houser]] said: \"I love Angel Studios ... I am not going to stop working with them.\"<ref name=\"IGN: Rockstar Envisions\" /> ''[[Daily Radar]]'' ranked Angel Studios fourth on a 2001 list of the five best developers for [[Sony]] platforms, citing the strength of ''[[Midnight Club: Street Racing]]'' and ''[[Smuggler's Run]]'' on the [[PlayStation 2]].<ref name=\"Daily Radar: Award\" />\n\nAround 2002, Angel discussed selling his company with Microsoft, [[Activision]] and Rockstar Games.<ref name=\"Polygon: How\" /> He had befriended Houser and his brother [[Dan Houser|Dan]], two of the founders of Rockstar Games, over a shared love of tequila.<ref name=\"Polygon: How\" /> Rockstar Games initially presented what Angel considered a [[low-ball]] offer, to which he did not respond.<ref name=\"Polygon: How\" /> The company then presented an offer that Angel said he could not refuse, and he felt that Rockstar Games was willing to give the studio the freedom he wanted it to have.<ref name=\"Polygon: How\" /> On the other hand, Rockstar Games sought to acquire Angel Studios' Angel Game Engine as a proprietary engine replacing [[Criterion Games]]' [[RenderWare]], which it had used for games in the ''[[Grand Theft Auto]]'' series.<ref name=\"Polygon: How\" /> Take-Two Interactive announced the acquisition of Angel Studios on November 20, 2002;

Capcom's [[Yoshiki Okamoto]] then approached Angel Studios with the idea for an original [[intellectual property]] entitled ''S.W.A.T.''.<ref name=\"Polygon: How\" /> It later adopted a [[Western (genre)|Western]] theme at Okamoto's recommendation, redefining the acronym as \"Spaghetti Western Action Team\".<ref name=\"Polygon: How\" /> Angel Studios began work on the game with Capcom's oversight and funding in 2000, and the latter announced the game in March 2002.<ref name=\"IGN: Red Dead Interview\" /><ref name=\"IGN: Capcom Unveils\" /> Its development was troubled, partially due to cultural differences between the two companies, and the game remained unplayable.<ref name=\"Polygon: How\" /> ''Red Dead Revolver'' missed the 2002 [[European Computer Trade Show]] and 2003 [[Electronic Entertainment Expo]] (E3).<ref name=\"IGN: Capcom TGS\" /><ref name=\"GameSpot: status update\" /> Okamoto then left Capcom,<ref name=\"Polygon: How\" /> which stopped funding the game in July 2003 and announced in August of that year that the game was canceled.<ref name=\"GameSpot: Capcom no longer\" /><ref name=\"GameSpot: Capcom cancels\" /> Rockstar Games acquired the rights to ''Red Dead Revolver'' in December, and resumed its development.<ref name=\"GameSpot: Rockstar rescues\" /><ref name=\"IGN: Rockstar Announces\" /> The game's \"[[Video game developer#\"Crunch time\"|crunch time]]\" increased for as rapid a release as possible, and it was released in May 2004 for the PlayStation 2 and Xbox.<ref name=\"Polygon: How\" />\n\nRockstar San Diego began developing ''Agent'', an open-world [[stealth game]] for the PlayStation 2 and Xbox, in 2003.<ref name=\"Polygon: Agent\" /><ref name=\"VG247: Another E3\" /> The development team leadership was mostly as the same as that of Rockstar San Diego's 2001 game ''[[Transworld Surf]]'', headed up by [[Video game producer|producer]] Luis Gigliotti.<ref name=\"Polygon: Agent\" /> In favor of developing ''Agent'', the team ceased work on an untitled [[Justice League]] game that was still being conceptualized.<ref name=\"Polygon: Agent\" /> Unlike prior Angel Studios games, ''Agent'' began a prototype stage with a full-size team.<ref name=\"Polygon: Agent\" /> This team was given little time to complete this prototype, leading to much \"[[Video game developer#\"Crunch time\"|crunch]]\" at the studio.<ref name=\"Polygon: Agent\" /> Rockstar Games also removed studio-wide vacations after successfully reaching milestones or launching a game, a change many employees felt was abrupt.<ref name=\"Polygon: Agent\" /> Some Rockstar San Diego artists traveled to [[Cairo]] and [[Washington, D.C.]], two locations ''Agent'' was to be set in.<ref name=\"Polygon: Agent\" /> The four artists that traveled to Cairo took \"over 10,000\" of such photographs.<ref name=\"Kotaku: Talking To The PS4\" /> In both cases, artists were detained by the local police forces;

He was a career soldier who served with distinction during the [[Italian Campaign (World War II)|Italian Campaign]] of [[World War II]].\n\n==Early life and military career==\nCrittenberger was born in [[Baltimore]], [[Maryland]] on December 2, 1890. After growing up in [[Anderson, Indiana]], he was appointed to the [[United States Military Academy]] (USMA) at [[West Point, New York]] in 1909, graduating four years later on June 12, 1913 with the West Point class of 1913, two years ahead of fellow cadet, friend and infantry officer, [[Dwight D. Eisenhower]].<ref>{{Citation| date=August 7, 1980| title=Obituary: General Willis D.

Nicholas]], [[Charles H. Corlett]], [[William A. McCullogh]], [[Douglass T. Greene]], [[Robert M. Perkins]], [[Louis A. Craig]], [[Carlos Brewer]], [[William R. Schmidt]], [[Alexander Patch]], [[Robert L. Spragins]], [[Francis K. Newcomer]], [[Henry B. Cheadle]], [[Lunsford E. Oliver]] and [[William L. Roberts (United States Army officer)|William L. Roberts]]. Like Crittenberger, they were all destined to become [[general officer]]s.\n\n==Between the wars==\nUnable to see service overseas in [[World War I]], where he remained in the United States training recruits, Crittenberger's advanced military education included the [[United States Army Cavalry School]] at [[Fort Riley]], [[Kansas]] in 1924, the [[United States Army Command and General Staff College]] at [[Fort Leavenworth]], Kansas in 1925 and the [[United States Army War College]] at [[Washington Barracks]] in [[Washington, D.C.]] in 1930. After assignments to [[Fort Knox]], [[Kentucky]], the [[1st Cavalry Regiment (United States)|1st Cavalry Regiment (Mechanized)]]'s new home in 1934, he served on [[Staff (military)|staff]] positions to the Chief of Cavalry in [[Washington (state)|Washington]] and, towards the end of the [[interwar period]], realizing that the cavalry's role in any future conflict would be limited (as World War I and [[trench warfare]] had proved), becoming increasingly interested in [[Armoured warfare|armored warfare]], and became [[chief of staff]] for the [[1st Armored Division (United States)|1st Armored Division]].\n\n==World War II==\nWith the onset of the United States entry into [[World War II]], Crittenberger, with the rank of [[Brigadier general (United States)|brigadier general]], was commanding the [[2nd Armored Brigade (United States)|2nd Armored Brigade]] of the [[2nd Armored Division (United States)|2nd Armored Division]], under Major General [[George S. Patton]]. In February 1942, two months after the [[Empire of Japan|Japanese]] [[attack on Pearl Harbor]] on December 7, 1941 and the [[Nazi Germany|German]] [[German declaration of war against the United States (1941)|declaration of war on the United States]] four days later, Crittenberger assumed command of the division while Patton was sent to command the [[I Armored Corps (United States)|I Armored Corps]]. In August 1942, relinquishing command of the 2nd Armored Division to Major General [[Ernest N. Harmon]], Crittenberger, now a major general, organized, trained and commanded the [[XIX Corps (United States)|III Armored Corps]], composed of the [[7th Armored Division (United States)|7th]] and [[11th Armored Division (United States)|11th Armored Division]]s at [[Fort Polk|Camp Polk]], [[Louisiana]]. Redesignated as [[XIX Corps (United States)|XIX Corps]] in October 1943, Crittenberger brought XIX Corps to England in January 1944.\n\n[[File:Willis Crittenberger and George Marshall 1942.jpg|thumb|left|On the left, Major General Willis Crittenberger and, on the right, the [[Chief of Staff of the United States Army]] General [[George Marshall]] at [[Fort Benning]], [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]], 1942.]]\n\nIn early 1944, General [[Dwight D. Eisenhower]], the [[Supreme Allied Commander]] for the impending [[Invasion of Normandy|Normandy invasion]], initially selected Crittenberger as one of three corps commanders, along with Major General [[Leonard T. Gerow]], commanding [[V Corps (United States)|V Corps]], and Major General [[Roscoe B. Woodruff]], commanding [[VII Corps (United States)|VII Corps]], for the invasion. All three were well-known and trusted by General Eisenhower. However, Lieutenant General [[Omar Bradley]], who Eisenhower selected as the [[First United States Army]] commander for the [[Normandy landings|D-Day invasion]], replaced Eisenhower's picks, seeking differing temperaments and commanders that had more combat experience. At the same time, Lieutenant General [[Jacob L. Devers]], Commanding General (CG) of the [[Mediterranean Theater of Operations|North African Theater of Operations, United States Army]] (NATOUSA), was seeking a corps commander for the [[United States Army North|Fifth United States Army]]'s [[IV Corps (United States)|IV Corps]] for the [[Italian Campaign (World War II)|Italian Campaign]] and Crittenberger was chosen.<ref>{{Citation| last =D'Este| first =Carlo=| publication-date =2002| year =2002| title =Eisenhower: A Soldier's Life| location =New York| publisher =Henry Holt| isbn =978-0-8050-5686-0| url =https://books.google.com/?id=sLZI7Gm_KXIC&pg=PA486&lpg=PA486&dq=willis+d+crittenberger| accessdate =2007-10-03}}</ref>\n\nCrittenberger relinquished command of XIX Corps, briefly, to Major General Woodruff, who soon handed over to Major General [[Charles H. Corlett]], a classmate from the West Point class of 1913, and departed England for the [[Mediterranean Theater of Operations]], assuming command of IV Corps from Major General [[Alexander Patch]], another West Point classmate, in Italy on March 20, 1944. Held in reserve during the early stages of the Italian Campaign, IV Corps replaced the [[VI Corps (United States)|VI Corps]], under Major General [[Lucian Truscott]], in the front line after the liberation of the Italian capital of [[Rome]] in early June. Crittenberger's corps, coming under command of Lieutenant General [[Mark W. Clark]]'s Fifth United States Army (itself part of the [[Allied Armies in Italy]], later designated [[15th Army Group]], commanded by British General [[Harold Alexander, 1st Earl Alexander of Tunis|Sir Harold Alexander]]) later fought on through the [[Gothic Line]], in some of the toughest and most difficult fighting of the Italian Campaign.\n\nHaving the [[Brazilian Expeditionary Force|1st Brazilian Infantry]] and the [[6th Armoured Division (South Africa)|6th South African Armoured]] Divisions in its ranks, in addition to the United States [[1st Armored Division (United States)|1st Armored]], the [[92nd Infantry Division (United States)|92nd Infantry]] and the [[10th Mountain]] Divisions, Crittenberger's IV Corps were in combat for over 390 days, 326 of them engaged in continuous combat. Crittenberger commanded IV Corps, still part of the Fifth Army, now commanded by Lieutenant General Lucian Truscott (like Crittenberger, a cavalryman who Crittenberger had taught while he was an instructor at the United States Army Cavalry School), after Lieutenant General Clark was promoted to the command of 15th Army Group, as the western arm of the [[Spring 1945 offensive in Italy|Allied thrust through northern Italy]] (codenamed Operation Grapeshot) to the [[Po (river)|Po River]], capturing large numbers of [[Wehrmacht|German troops]], which ended with the surrender of the remaining German forces in Italy on May 2, 1945.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">{{Citation | date=August 7, 1980 | periodical=New York Times}}</ref> The [[end of World War II in Europe]] came soon after, followed by the [[surrender of Japan]] on September 2, 1945, almost exactly six years since the war had begun. During the campaign in Italy Crittenberger operated alongside Major General [[Geoffrey Keyes]], another of Crittenberger's West Point classmates, who was commanding [[II Corps (United States)|II Corps]].\n\n==Postwar career==\nIn the postwar years Crittenberger commanded the Caribbean Defense Command, including the [[Panama Canal Zone]], then in 1947, became first commander-in-chief of United States Caribbean Command, a regional unified theater command and predecessor to today's [[United States Southern Command]]. After a two-year stint as Commanding General of the [[First United States Army]], at [[Fort Jay]], [[Governors Island]], [[New York (state)|New York]], Crittenberger concluded his active duty military career in December 1952, leaving [[New York City]] with a ticker tape parade up Broadway.<ref>{{Citation| date=December 29, 1952| title=People (Crittenberger retirement)| periodical=Time}}</ref>\n\n==Civilian career==\nIn retirement, Crittenberger advised President Dwight D.

He was a career soldier who served with distinction during the [[Italian Campaign (World War II)|Italian Campaign]] of [[World War II]].\n\n==Early life and military career==\nCrittenberger was born in [[Baltimore]], [[Maryland]] on December 2, 1890. After growing up in [[Anderson, Indiana]], he was appointed to the [[United States Military Academy]] (USMA) at [[West Point, New York]] in 1909, graduating four years later on June 12, 1913 with the West Point class of 1913, two years ahead of fellow cadet, friend and infantry officer, [[Dwight D. Eisenhower]].<ref>{{Citation| date=August 7, 1980| title=Obituary: General Willis D.

Nicholas]], [[Charles H. Corlett]], [[William A. McCullogh]], [[Douglass T. Greene]], [[Robert M. Perkins]], [[Louis A. Craig]], [[Carlos Brewer]], [[William R. Schmidt]], [[Alexander Patch]], [[Robert L. Spragins]], [[Francis K. Newcomer]], [[Henry B. Cheadle]], [[Lunsford E. Oliver]] and [[William L. Roberts (United States Army officer)|William L. Roberts]]. Like Crittenberger, they were all destined to become [[general officer]]s.\n\n==Between the wars==\nUnable to see service overseas in [[World War I]], where he remained in the United States training recruits, Crittenberger's advanced military education included the [[United States Army Cavalry School]] at [[Fort Riley]], [[Kansas]] in 1924, the [[United States Army Command and General Staff College]] at [[Fort Leavenworth]], Kansas in 1925 and the [[United States Army War College]] at [[Washington Barracks]] in [[Washington, D.C.]] in 1930. After assignments to [[Fort Knox]], [[Kentucky]], the [[1st Cavalry Regiment (United States)|1st Cavalry Regiment (Mechanized)]]'s new home in 1934, he served on [[Staff (military)|staff]] positions to the Chief of Cavalry in [[Washington (state)|Washington]] and, towards the end of the [[interwar period]], realizing that the cavalry's role in any future conflict would be limited (as World War I and [[trench warfare]] had proved), becoming increasingly interested in [[Armoured warfare|armored warfare]], and became [[chief of staff]] for the [[1st Armored Division (United States)|1st Armored Division]].\n\n==World War II==\nWith the onset of the United States entry into [[World War II]], Crittenberger, with the rank of [[Brigadier general (United States)|brigadier general]], was commanding the [[2nd Armored Brigade (United States)|2nd Armored Brigade]] of the [[2nd Armored Division (United States)|2nd Armored Division]], under Major General [[George S. Patton]]. In February 1942, two months after the [[Empire of Japan|Japanese]] [[attack on Pearl Harbor]] on December 7, 1941 and the [[Nazi Germany|German]] [[German declaration of war against the United States (1941)|declaration of war on the United States]] four days later, Crittenberger assumed command of the division while Patton was sent to command the [[I Armored Corps (United States)|I Armored Corps]]. In August 1942, relinquishing command of the 2nd Armored Division to Major General [[Ernest N. Harmon]], Crittenberger, now a major general, organized, trained and commanded the [[XIX Corps (United States)|III Armored Corps]], composed of the [[7th Armored Division (United States)|7th]] and [[11th Armored Division (United States)|11th Armored Division]]s at [[Fort Polk|Camp Polk]], [[Louisiana]]. Redesignated as [[XIX Corps (United States)|XIX Corps]] in October 1943, Crittenberger brought XIX Corps to England in January 1944.\n\n[[File:Willis Crittenberger and George Marshall 1942.jpg|thumb|left|On the left, Major General Willis Crittenberger and, on the right, the [[Chief of Staff of the United States Army]] General [[George Marshall]] at [[Fort Benning]], [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]], 1942.]]\n\nIn early 1944, General [[Dwight D. Eisenhower]], the [[Supreme Allied Commander]] for the impending [[Invasion of Normandy|Normandy invasion]], initially selected Crittenberger as one of three corps commanders, along with Major General [[Leonard T. Gerow]], commanding [[V Corps (United States)|V Corps]], and Major General [[Roscoe B. Woodruff]], commanding [[VII Corps (United States)|VII Corps]], for the invasion. All three were well-known and trusted by General Eisenhower. However, Lieutenant General [[Omar Bradley]], who Eisenhower selected as the [[First United States Army]] commander for the [[Normandy landings|D-Day invasion]], replaced Eisenhower's picks, seeking differing temperaments and commanders that had more combat experience. At the same time, Lieutenant General [[Jacob L. Devers]], Commanding General (CG) of the [[Mediterranean Theater of Operations|North African Theater of Operations, United States Army]] (NATOUSA), was seeking a corps commander for the [[United States Army North|Fifth United States Army]]'s [[IV Corps (United States)|IV Corps]] for the [[Italian Campaign (World War II)|Italian Campaign]] and Crittenberger was chosen.<ref>{{Citation| last =D'Este| first =Carlo=| publication-date =2002| year =2002| title =Eisenhower: A Soldier's Life| location =New York| publisher =Henry Holt| isbn =978-0-8050-5686-0| url =https://books.google.com/?id=sLZI7Gm_KXIC&pg=PA486&lpg=PA486&dq=willis+d+crittenberger| accessdate =2007-10-03}}</ref>\n\nCrittenberger relinquished command of XIX Corps, briefly, to Major General Woodruff, who soon handed over to Major General [[Charles H. Corlett]], a classmate from the West Point class of 1913, and departed England for the [[Mediterranean Theater of Operations]], assuming command of IV Corps from Major General [[Alexander Patch]], another West Point classmate, in Italy on March 20, 1944. Held in reserve during the early stages of the Italian Campaign, IV Corps replaced the [[VI Corps (United States)|VI Corps]], under Major General [[Lucian Truscott]], in the front line after the liberation of the Italian capital of [[Rome]] in early June. Crittenberger's corps, coming under command of Lieutenant General [[Mark W. Clark]]'s Fifth United States Army (itself part of the [[Allied Armies in Italy]], later designated [[15th Army Group]], commanded by British General [[Harold Alexander, 1st Earl Alexander of Tunis|Sir Harold Alexander]]) later fought on through the [[Gothic Line]], in some of the toughest and most difficult fighting of the Italian Campaign.\n\nHaving the [[Brazilian Expeditionary Force|1st Brazilian Infantry]] and the [[6th Armoured Division (South Africa)|6th South African Armoured]] Divisions in its ranks, in addition to the United States [[1st Armored Division (United States)|1st Armored]], the [[92nd Infantry Division (United States)|92nd Infantry]] and the [[10th Mountain]] Divisions, Crittenberger's IV Corps were in combat for over 390 days, 326 of them engaged in continuous combat. Crittenberger commanded IV Corps, still part of the Fifth Army, now commanded by Lieutenant General Lucian Truscott (like Crittenberger, a cavalryman who Crittenberger had taught while he was an instructor at the United States Army Cavalry School), after Lieutenant General Clark was promoted to the command of 15th Army Group, as the western arm of the [[Spring 1945 offensive in Italy|Allied thrust through northern Italy]] (codenamed Operation Grapeshot) to the [[Po (river)|Po River]], capturing large numbers of [[Wehrmacht|German troops]], which ended with the surrender of the remaining German forces in Italy on May 2, 1945.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">{{Citation | date=August 7, 1980 | periodical=New York Times}}</ref> The [[end of World War II in Europe]] came soon after, followed by the [[surrender of Japan]] on September 2, 1945, almost exactly six years since the war had begun. During the campaign in Italy Crittenberger operated alongside Major General [[Geoffrey Keyes]], another of Crittenberger's West Point classmates, who was commanding [[II Corps (United States)|II Corps]].\n\n==Postwar career==\nIn the postwar years Crittenberger commanded the Caribbean Defense Command, including the [[Panama Canal Zone]], then in 1947, became first commander-in-chief of United States Caribbean Command, a regional unified theater command and predecessor to today's [[United States Southern Command]]. After a two-year stint as Commanding General of the [[First United States Army]], at [[Fort Jay]], [[Governors Island]], [[New York (state)|New York]], Crittenberger concluded his active duty military career in December 1952, leaving [[New York City]] with a ticker tape parade up Broadway.<ref>{{Citation| date=December 29, 1952| title=People (Crittenberger retirement)| periodical=Time}}</ref>\n\n==Civilian career==\nIn retirement, Crittenberger advised President Dwight D.
