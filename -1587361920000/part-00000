Very little of his life before becoming emperor is known, other than that he was a {{lang|la|[[Domesticus (Roman Empire)|domesticus]]}} (personal assistant) who served under the commanders [[Ardabur (consul 427)|Ardabur]] and his son [[Aspar]] for fifteen years. After the death of Emperor [[Theodosius&nbsp;II]] on 28 July 450, Marcian was made a candidate for the throne by Aspar, who held much influence because of his military power. After a month of negotiations [[Pulcheria]],  Theodosius' sister, agreed to marry Marcian. [[Flavius Zeno]], a military leader whose influence was similar to Aspar's, may have been involved in these negotiations, as he was given the high-ranking court title of {{lang|la|[[Patrician (ancient Rome)#Late Roman and Byzantine periods|patrician]]}} upon Marcian's accession. Marcian was elected and inaugurated on 25 August 450.\n\nMarcian reversed many of the actions of Theodosius{{nbsp}}II in the [[Eastern Roman Empire]]'s relationship with the [[Hunnic Empire|Huns]] under [[Attila]] and in religious matters. Marcian almost immediately revoked all treaties with Attila, ending all subsidy payments to him. In 452, while Attila was raiding Italy, then a part of the [[Western Roman Empire]], Marcian launched expeditions across the [[Danube]] into the [[Great Hungarian Plain]], defeating the [[Huns]] in their own heartland. This action, accompanied by the famine and plague that broke out in northern Italy, allowed the Western Roman Empire to bribe Attila into retreating from the Italian peninsula.\n\nAfter Attila's death in 453, Marcian took advantage of the resulting fragmentation of the Hunnic confederation by settling [[Germanic peoples|Germanic]] tribes within Roman lands as {{lang|la|[[foederati]]}} (\"federates\" providing military service in exchange for benefits). Marcian also convened the [[Council of Chalcedon]], which declared that [[Jesus]] had two \"[[Nature (philosophy)|natures]]\": divine and human. This led to the alienation of the population of the eastern provinces of [[Byzantine Syria|Syria]] and [[Byzantine Egypt|Egypt]], as many of them were [[miaphysites]], rejecting the new official [[Christology]]. Marcian died on 26 January 457, leaving the Eastern Roman Empire with a treasury surplus of seven million [[solidi]] coins, an impressive achievement considering the economic ruin inflicted upon the Eastern Roman Empire by the Huns and Theodosius' tribute payments. After his death, Aspar passed over Marcian's son-in-law, [[Anthemius]], and had a military commander, [[Leo I the Thracian|Leo&nbsp;I]], elected as emperor.\n\n==Early life==\nMarcian was born in {{circa}} 392,{{sfn|Meijer|2004|p=153}}{{sfn|Nathan|1998}} in either [[Thracia|Thrace]]{{sfn|Vasiliev|1980|p=104}} or [[Praetorian prefecture of Illyricum|Illyria]],{{sfn|Nathan|1998}} and named Flavius Marcianus.{{sfn|Keppie|2002|p=137}} The ancient historian [[John Malalas]] describes him as being tall and having some sort of foot impediment.{{sfn|Baldwin|1982 |p=98}} Little of Marcian's early life is known. His father had served in the military and at a young age Marcian enlisted at [[Philippopolis (Thracia)|Philippopolis]] in Thrace. By the time of the [[Roman\u2013Sasanian War (421\u2013422)|Roman\u2013Sassanian War of 421\u2013422]], Marcian had likely reached the military rank of [[Military tribune|tribune]]\u2014the historian [[Theophanes the Confessor]] mentions him commanding a military unit. He did not see action in the war, having become ill in [[Lycia]]. There he was cared for by [[Tatianus (Praefectus urbi)|Tatianus]], who would be made {{lang|la|[[praefectus urbi]]}} (prefect of Constantinople) by Marcian, and Tatianus' brother [[Iulius (praeses)|Iulius]].{{sfn|Nathan|1998}}{{sfn|Jones|Martindale|Morris|1980|pp=714\u2013715}}{{sfn|Friell|Williams|2005|p=84}}{{sfn|Lee|2013|p=96}} Marcian eventually rose to become the {{lang|la|[[Domesticus (Roman Empire)|domesticus]]}} (personal assistant) of [[Aspar]], the {{lang|la|[[magister militum]]}} (commander-in-chief) of the Eastern Roman Empire. Despite being half-[[Alans|Alanic]] and half-[[Goths|Gothic]], Aspar held much influence in the empire.{{sfn|Nathan|1998}}{{sfn|Lee|2013|p=96}}{{sfn|Friell|Williams|2005|pp=45, 75, 84}} In the early 430s, Marcian served under Aspar in [[Africa (Roman province)|Roman Africa]], where he was captured by [[Vandals]]. [[Evagrius Scholasticus]], [[Procopius]] and later authors give a likely false account in which Marcian, while in captivity, met the Vandal king [[Gaiseric]], who predicted he would later become emperor. After his capture, Marcian is not mentioned again until the death of the eastern emperor, [[Theodosius&nbsp;II]].{{sfn|Nathan|1998}}\n\n==Background==\n===Reign of Theodosius II===\nThe Eastern Roman Empire was plagued by external threats during the reign of Theodosius&nbsp;II. In 429 the Vandals, led by Gaiseric, began to conquer Roman Africa. Theodosius immediately organized a response, sending Aspar and three other commanders to attempt to repel them in the summer of 431. To the north, the [[Huns]], who had customarily attacked the empire whenever its armies were preoccupied, withdrawing as those forces returned, sent ambassadors to Theodosius in 431, demanding tribute. He agreed to their demand to pay {{convert|350|lb}} of gold each year. In 434, the Eastern Roman armies were still campaigning against the Vandals in Africa, having faced initial defeats and the withdrawal of many of the Western Roman soldiers. In the face of Eastern Roman weakness, the Huns doubled their demand, asking for {{convert|700|lb}} of gold per year, which Theodosius agreed to. The threat the Huns posed to his weakly protected empire was enough that Theodosius recalled a large number of his forces from Africa. With large numbers of the Eastern Roman armies home, and [[Attila]], who had just taken power in the Hunnic Confederation, busy campaigning to the north, Theodosius refused to pay the tribute and continued to refuse to until 439.{{sfn|Thompson|1950|pp=60\u201365}} \n\nOn 19 October 439, the Vandals defeated the weakened Eastern Roman armies and captured the major city of [[Carthage]]. Both the Western and Eastern Roman Empires began preparing a massive counter-offensive, stripping the Balkan provinces of protection. In the spring of 440, 1,100 ships set sail from Constantinople for Africa;{{sfn|Thompson|1950|pp=60\u201365}} sending away such a large number of the Eastern Roman forces was a huge gamble on Theodosius' part. He was betting the fortified cities along the [[Danube]] could delay the Huns long enough for the invasion force to gain a secure foothold in Africa, allowing troops to be withdrawn back to the northern frontier. This gamble worked until 442 when the bishop of [[Margus (city)|Margus]] led a raiding party into the Huns' territory and desecrated their royal tombs. In response to this desecration, Attila demanded that the bishop be handed over. To ensure his own safety, the bishop struck a deal with Attila, surrendering the city of Margus to him in exchange for his own life. With control of Margus, Attila had a foothold across the Danube, which he aggressively exploited, capturing and destroying the cities of [[Viminacium]], [[Singidunum]], and [[Sirmium]]. Theodosius recalled Aspar to Constantinople and launched a counterattack. After his force was decisively defeated, Theodosius undertook to pay tribute to the Huns every year, which he did until his death in 450.{{sfn|Thompson|1950|pp=60\u201378}}\n\n===Rise to the throne===\nAfter Theodosius&nbsp;II died unexpectedly in a riding accident on 28 July 450, the Eastern Roman Empire faced its first [[succession crisis]] in 60 years. Theodosius had no sons, nor had he designated a successor.{{sfn|Nathan|1998}}{{sfn|Lee|2013|p=94}} Some later sources state that he willed the throne to Marcian on his deathbed, but this is thought to be propaganda created by Marcian's supporters after his election.{{Sfn|Nathan|1998}} Marcian had served Aspar and his father [[Ardabur (consul 427)|Ardabur]] loyally for fifteen years. Aspar conspired to have Marcian elected and was able to negotiate with other powerful figures to have him made the emperor, despite his relative obscurity.{{sfn|Lee|2013|p=96}} There was a one-month interregnum where negotiations for the succession took place, one of which was with Pulcheria, Theodosius&nbsp;II's sister, who agreed to marry Marcian;{{sfn|Lee|2013|p=96}} it is thought that Pulcheria agreed to marry Marcian on the condition that he would abandon Theodosius II{{'}}s religious policies and convoke a Church council.{{sfn|Lee|2013|p=104}} Their marriage helped to legitimize Marcian's rule, as Pulcheria's family, the [[Theodosian dynasty]], had direct ties to the throne.{{sfn|Lee|2013|p=96}} Despite being married to Marcian, Pulcheria kept the vow of [[virginity]] she had made in 413, at age 14, during her three years of marriage to him.{{sfn|Lee|2013|p=96}}{{sfn|Smith|2008|p=537}}{{sfn|Holum|1989|p=209}} \n\nHistorian [[Doug Lee (historian)|Doug Lee]] proposes that negotiations were also needed between Aspar and [[Flavius Zeno]], who was in a similar position of military power. Zeno was given the prestigious rank of [[patrician (ancient Rome)|patrician]] upon Marcian's ascension in 450, suggesting a deal whereby Zeno was rewarded for supporting Marcian instead of claiming the throne for himself;{{sfn|Lee|2013|p=96}} Zeno would ultimately die within a year of Marcian{{'}}s accession.{{sfn|Lee|2013|p=98}} Aspar{{'s}} son, [[Ardabur (consul 447)|Ardabur]], was promoted to command the army of the [[Praetorian prefecture of the East|Perfecture of the East]] as the new {{lang|la|[[magister militum per Orientem]]}}, soon after Marcian's accession.{{sfn|Nathan|1998}}{{sfn|Lee|2013|p=98}}{{sfn|Lee|2001|p=43}}\n\nMarcian was elected on 25 August 450, with Pulcheria herself crowning him emperor, a unique event symbolizing that the imperial power was shared, and likely to boost Marcian's legitimacy further.{{Sfn|Nathan|1998}} Marcian took the regnal name of Imperator Caesar Flavius Marcianus Augustus upon his coronation.{{sfn|Babcock|2005|p=157}} The election of Marcian in 450 resulted in large changes to eastern imperial policy. [[Chrysaphius]], the [[eunuch]] and {{lang|la|[[spatharios]]}} (guard of the imperial chambers), who had exercised much influence over Theodosius, was either murdered or executed. Both Pulcheria and Zeno were opposed to Chrysaphius' influence, which may have motivated Marcian's actions. Marcian took a tougher stance against the Huns and a more direct role in ecclesiastical affairs. [[Byzantine studies|Byzantist]] [[Constance Head]] considers Marcian to be an \"an independent-minded emperor.\"{{sfn|Head|1982|p=20}} Lee states that Marcian \"can appear as a stronger figure than many other fifth-century incumbents of the imperial office\", but notes that \"Flavius Zeno and Pulcheria had both been opponents of Chrysaphius, so the changes may be more a reflection of their influence.\"{{sfn|Nathan|1998}}{{sfn|Lee|2013|pp=97\u201398}}\n\n==Reign==\n===Conflict with the Huns===\n[[File:450 roman-hunnic-empire 1764x1116.jpg|right|Alt=A map of Europe showing the territories of the Hunnic confederation and the Roman Empire | A map of Europe in 450 AD, showing the Hunnic confederation under Attila in orange, and the Roman Empire in yellow|thumb|upright=2|alt=A colored drawing of Europe in 450 AD, showing the borders of states at the time of Attila by different colors, with the Roman Empire in yellow, the Hunnic Confederation in orange, the Vandal Kingdom in blue, the Franks in green, the Goths in pink, the Sueves in purple, the Saxons in light pink, the Burgundians in brown, the Lombards in bright yellow, and the Alans in light blue.]]\nAlmost immediately after becoming emperor, Marcian revoked Theodosius' treaties with Attila and proclaimed the end of subsidies. He stated that he might grant gifts if Attila was friendly, but Attila would be repelled if he attempted to raid the Eastern Roman Empire. At this time Attila was preparing to invade the Western Roman Empire, under the guise of helping Emperor [[Valentinian&nbsp;III]] against the [[Visigoths]]. Attila reacted angrily to Marcian's proposal, demanding tribute, but did not alter his invasion plans. He led his horde from [[Pannonia]] in spring 451 into the Western Roman Empire.{{sfn|Friell|Williams|2005|p=84}} [[Flavius Aetius]], who was the supreme commander of the Western Roman army as {{lang|la|[[Comes et Magister Utriusque Militiae]]}}, organized a defense and called upon the Visigoths, [[Franks]], [[Burgundians]], Alans, Saxons, Celtic [[Armorica]]ns, and other tribal groups numbering about 60,000 to aid him. Attila's forces were made up of [[Gepids]], Alans, [[Scirii]], [[Heruli (military unit)|Heruli]], [[Rugii|Rugians]], along with a number of Franks, Burgundians, and [[Ostrogoths]].{{sfn|Friell|Williams|2005|p=85}}\n\nAttila sacked [[Metz]] and attempted a siege of [[Orleans]], before meeting Aetius' forces at the [[Battle of the Catalaunian Plains]], in northeast [[Gaul]]. This battle involved around 100,000 men and resulted in very large losses on both sides. After the battle, Attila retreated to the [[Great Hungarian Plain]], and Aetius dismissed his coalition of tribes, sending them back to their own territories. In spring 452, Attila again launched a raid, into Italy, which was almost entirely undefended. He was likely motivated by a desire for revenge, along with a need to raid to stabilize his tribal state, which was dependent upon raiding for loot and resources. Attila captured the city of [[Aquileia]] after a long and difficult siege,{{sfn|Friell|Williams|2005|p=86}} and [[looted|sacked]] it. He then raided across northern Italy, taking [[Mediolanum]] ([[Milan]]) and other important cities. There was much fear that Attila would attack [[Rome]] itself, the walls of which were weaker than those of some cities he had already captured. During this period, other than cutting his [[lines of communication]] and harassing his rear forces, Aetius did not launch a direct attack on Attila.{{sfn|Friell|Williams|2005|p=87}}\n\nDespite the plunder he now had from capturing Aquileia, Milan, and other cities, Attila was quickly placed in a precarious situation, because of the actions of both Eastern and Western Rome. In Italy, he was seriously lacking in funds, having not received subsidies from either Eastern or Western Rome for two years. Constant warfare had depleted his forces. In addition, Attila's homeland was threatened by the Eastern Empire which, despite the punitive raids he ordered, took the offensive against the Great Hungarian Plain in mid-452, attacking across the Danube and inflicting a defeat upon the Huns.{{sfn|Friell|Williams|2005|p=87}} The area attacked by the Eastern Romans was home to Ostrogoths and Gepids, two groups bitterly opposed to Hunnic rule, and was the [[breadbasket]] of the Hunnic Empire. The loss of food supply from Attila's own land coupled with a famine that Italy was suffering at the time, along with a plague that followed it, placed yet more strain upon Attila, allowing the Western Roman Empire to bribe him into retreating to his homeland. After returning to the Great Hungarian Plain, he threatened to invade the Eastern Empire the following spring and conquer it entirely.{{sfn|Friell|Williams|2005|p=87}}{{sfn|Thompson|1950|p=70}} Marcian and Aspar ignored his threats. They reasoned, based upon the previous treaties that Attila had broken, that he could not be permanently deterred even by tons of gold. The pair believed the gold would be better spent building up armies, not appeasing threats. Also, the rich Asian and African provinces, which were protected behind Constantinople, were secure enough to allow the Eastern Empire to retake any European provinces it might lose. This campaign never came to fruition, as Attila died unexpectedly in 453, either from [[hemorrhaging]] or alcoholic [[suffocation]], after celebrating a marriage to one of his many wives. After his death, his tribal confederation rapidly fell apart, starting first with rebellions of the Ostrogoths.{{sfn|Friell|Williams|2005|p=88}}\n\nThis fragmentation allowed the Eastern Empire to resume its policy of playing off barbarians against each other, to stop any one tribe from becoming too powerful. It is almost certain that the Gepid king [[Ardaric]] came to an agreement with Marcian. Ardaric had formed a coalition of the Rugians, Sciri, Heruli, and his own Gepids, which he led against the remaining Hunnic confederation. Ardaric, alongside the Ostrogoth leaders [[Theodemir (Ostrogothic king)|Theodemir]], [[Valamir]] and [[Videmir]], decisively defeated Attila's oldest son, [[Ellac]], at the [[Battle of Nedao]] in 455, where he was slain. After this battle, the Hunnic confederation fell apart entirely. In the wake of the collapse of the Hunnic Empire, Marcian accepted the Ostrogoths, who had established themselves in [[Pannonia Prima]] and [[Pannonia Valeria|Valeria]]\u2014nominally two Western Roman provinces\u2014as {{lang|la|[[foederati]]}}.{{sfn|Nathan|1998}}{{sfn|Friell|Williams|2005|pp=89\u201391}}{{sfn|Elton|2018|p=172}} This marked the continuation of the tacit abandonment of a [[Danube\u2013Iller\u2013Rhine Limes|rigid Danube barrier]], which had previously been manned by Roman {{lang|la|[[laeti]]}}, barbarians settled directly in Roman land in exchange for military service. For some time before Marcian, the {{lang|la|laeti}} had been replaced by {{lang|la|foederati}}, although the distinction between the two was increasingly breaking down. Marcian's successors would grant the status of {{lang|la|foederati}} to multiple peoples and ceding them lands in the recovered European provinces: the Rugians in eastern Thrace, Sciri in [[Lower Moesia]] and [[Scythia]], Gepids in [[Diocese of Dacia|Dacia]]. This network of subject peoples, who were generally reliable and manageable, was beneficial to the Eastern Empire. The various tribal peoples generally kept each other's power in check without Roman intervention. They could also be induced to serve the empire against its enemies by way of gifts, subsidies, and treaties.{{sfn|Nathan|1998}}{{sfn|Friell|Williams|2005|pp=89\u201391}} After the death of Attila, Marcian enjoyed a relatively peaceful reign, although he won some small campaigns against the [[Saracens]] in [[Roman Syria|Syria]] and against the [[Blemmyes]] in [[Roman Egypt|Egypt]].{{sfn|Nathan|1998}}{{sfn|Gregory|1991|p=1296}}\n\n===Religious policy===\n[[File:Fourth ecumenical council of chalcedon - 1876.jpg|thumb|''Fourth Ecumenical Council of Chalcedon'', 1876&nbsp;painting by [[Vasily Surikov]]|alt=A wall painting of the Council of Chalcedon showing Marcian and Pulcheria seated on thrones.]]\nDuring the time period of the 5th century, a central religious issue was the debate concerning how the human and divine nature of [[Jesus Christ]] were associated, following the [[Arian controversy]]. The [[Catechetical School of Alexandria|School of Alexandria]], including theologians such as [[Athanasius]], asserted the equality of Christ and God, and therefore focused upon the divinity of Christ. The [[School of Antioch]], including theologians such as [[Theodore of Mopsuestia]], determined not to lose the human aspect of Christ, focused upon his humanity.{{sfn|Lee|2013|p=137}}\n\nShortly before Marcian became emperor, the [[Second Council of Ephesus]] was held in 449. The council stated that Jesus had one divine united nature, called {{lang|la|[[miaphysitism|miaphysis]]}}; this was rejected by the [[Pope]] and the [[Patriarch of Constantinople]] due to disputes on the matter of [[Christology]], as the Pope and Patriarch of Constantinople saw the belief in miaphysis as [[heretical]].{{sfn|Lee|2013|p=145}}{{sfn|Vasiliev|1980|pp=99 & 105}}{{sfn|Davis|2004|p=81}} \n\nTo repudiate the Second Council of Ephesus, Marcian convened a new council of the imperial church, deemed to pass [[ecumenical council|universally respected canons]], in 451. Pulcheria may have influenced this decision or even made the convention of a council a requirement during her negotiations with Aspar to marry Marcian. The council was to take place near Constantinople so that the government could watch the proceedings closely. Initially, it was to be held at the city of [[Nicaea]], which held enormous religious importance to the early church, as it was the site of its first council, the [[First Council of Nicaea]] in 325. However, Marcian successfully requested the transfer of the location to [[Chalcedon]]. This was closer to Constantinople and would allow him to respond quickly to any events along the Danube frontier. The [[Council of Chalcedon]] met in October 451. About 500 [[bishops]] attended it, most of them Eastern Roman, although two African bishops and two Papal legates sent by [[Pope Leo&nbsp;I]] attended.{{sfn|Lee|2013|p=145}}{{sfn|Gallagher|2008|p=585}}{{sfn|Whitworth|2017|p=360}} This council condemned the Second Council of Ephesus and agreed that Jesus had a divine nature ({{lang|la|[[physis]]}}) and a human nature, united in one person ({{lang|la|[[Hypostasis (philosophy and religion)|hypostasis]]}}), \"without confusion, change, division, or separation.\"{{sfn|Lee|2013|p=146}}\n\nThe council also agreed to condemn the Coptic [[Pope Dioscorus&nbsp;I of Alexandria]], who had overseen the Second Council of Ephesus, and revoke the condemnations of [[Ibas of Edessa]] and [[Theodoret]], which had taken place during this Council. The council also repeated the importance of the [[See of Constantinople]], placing it firmly in second place behind the See of Rome, and giving it the right to appoint bishops in the Eastern Roman Empire, over the objection of Pope Leo I;{{sfn|Nathan|1998}}{{sfn|Lee|2013|p=147}}{{sfn|Lee|2001|p=814}} the Patriarchs of Alexandria also objected to the elevation of the See of Constantinople.{{sfn|Bauer|2010|p=122}} The council ended in November 451, after which Marcian issued numerous [[edicts]] confirming the outcomes of the council;{{sfn|Nathan|1998}}{{sfn|Lee|2013|p=147}}{{sfn|Lee|2001|p=814}} showing that the outcome of the council was not universally accepted.{{sfn|Lee|2013|p=148}} One such edict ordered the repression of [[Eutychianism|Eutychianists]], who did not believe in the hypostatic union of Jesus' two natures, barring them from holding state offices, forbidding them from criticizing the Council of Chalcedon, and ordering their literature, along with that of the [[Nestorians]], to be burned.{{sfn|Bury|2012|p=380}} \n\nThe anti-Miaphysite resolutions of the council led to a large increase in civil disruption in the eastern provinces of Syria and Egypt, where the majority of the population was Miaphysitic. Several violent revolts were put down with military force after significant bloodshed, in Jerusalem, Alexandria, and Antioch;{{Sfn|Vasiliev|1980|p=105}} as well as sending the military to suppress monks in [[Palaestina Prima|Palestine]]<!--Please note that this was the proper Roman name for the province and has no relation to the modern Israel\u2013Palestine debates.--> and placing troops in [[Alexandria]] to ensure the installation of [[Proterius of Alexandria]], who was to replace the deposed [[Pope Dioscorus I of Alexandria|Pope Dioscorus I]].{{sfn|Nathan|1998}} According to the Byzantist [[Alexander Vasiliev (historian)|Alexander Vasiliev]], even after these revolts were put down, the popular dissatisfaction with the state church among the Miaphysite and Nestorian population remained, as the eastern provinces became increasingly convinced of their need for independence from the Eastern Roman Empire. Vasiliev states that this would lead to long-lasting disloyalty toward the Eastern Roman government among the eastern provinces, ultimately facilitating the loss of these provinces to the Sassanians and later to the [[Arabs]].{{Sfn|Vasiliev|1980|pp=105\u2013106}} As an additional result of the council and the following edicts, many Christians who disagreed with the council, including many Nestorians, migrated to the [[Sassanian Empire]].{{sfn|Bauer|2010|pp=122\u2013123}} The separation of the Miaphysites from the churches accepting Chalcedonian doctrine would be made final after the failed attempts of reconciliation under Emperor [[Justinian I]] ({{Reign|527|565}}), with the Miaphysites splitting the [[Oriental Orthodox Churches]] from the main body of Christians.{{sfn|Meyendorff|1989|pp=194\u2013202}}\n\nMarcian also funded Pulcheria's extensive building projects until her death in July 453. All of them focused on the construction of religious buildings,{{sfn|Nathan|1998}} including the [[Church of St. Mary of Blachernae (Istanbul)|Church of St. Mary of Blachernae]] and the [[Hodegon Monastery]].{{sfn|Grant|1985|p=306}} Marcian was compared to both [[Paul the Apostle]] and the Biblical king [[David]],{{sfn|Herrin|2009|p=11}} by the legates at the Council of Chalcedon.{{sfn|Bjornlie|2016|p=60}}\n\n===Economic and legal policy===\nAt the beginning of Marcian's reign, the Eastern Roman treasury was almost bankrupt, the result of the huge tributes paid to Attila by Theodosius. Marcian reversed this near bankruptcy, not by levying new taxes, but by cutting expenditure.{{sfn|Bury|2012|pp=236\u2013237}} Upon his accession, he declared a remission of all debts owed to the state.{{sfn|Nathan|1998}} Marcian attempted to improve the efficiency of the state in multiple ways.{{sfn|Bury|2012|pp=236\u2013237}} Marcian laid out legal reforms in his [[Novel (Roman law)|novels]], or codes of law, containing 20 laws, many of which were targeted at reducing the corruption and abuses of office that had existed during the reign of Theodosius; five of which are preserved in full.{{sfn|Jones|1986|p=217}}{{sfn|Pharr|Davidson|Pharr|2001|p=562}}\n\nMarcian mandated that the office of [[praetorship]] (officer in charge of public games and works) could only be given to [[Byzantine Senate#Admission and composition|senators]] who resided in Constantinople, attempted to curb the practice of selling administrative offices, and decreed that [[Roman consul|consuls]] should be responsible for the maintenance of [[Valens Aqueduct|Constantinople's aqueducts]]. He repealed the {{lang|la|[[Follis (tax)|follis]]}}, a tax on senators' property that amounted to seven pounds of gold per annum.{{sfn|Bury|2012|pp=236\u2013237}} Marcian removed the financial responsibilities of the [[Roman consul|consuls]] and praetors, held since the time of the [[Roman Republic]], to fund public sports and games or give wealth to the citizens of Constantinople, respectively. In addition, he made it so that only a {{lang|la|[[vir illustris]]}} (a high-ranking man) could hold either office.{{sfn|Nathan|1998}} He also partially repealed a marriage law enacted by [[Constantine I]], which decreed that a man of senatorial status could not marry a slave, [[freedwoman]], actress, or woman of no social status ({{lang|la|[[Honestiores and humiliores|humilis]]}}), which had been created in an attempt to preserve the purity of the senatorial class. Marcian adjusted this law by declaring that the law should not exclude a woman of good character, regardless of her social status or wealth.{{sfn|Bury|2012|pp=236\u2013237}} By the time of his death, Marcian's shrewd cutting of expenditures and his avoidance of large-scale wars left the Eastern Roman treasury with a surplus of {{convert|100,000|lb}} of gold.{{sfn|Nathan|1998}} \n\nIn 451, Marcian decreed that anyone who performed [[Paganism|pagan rites]] would lose their property and be condemned to death and that no pagan temples, which had previously been closed, could be reopened. To ensure this law was implemented, he set a penalty of {{convert|50|lb|kg}} of gold for any judge, governor or official who did not enforce the law.{{sfn|Evans|2002|p=66}}\n\n===Politics===\nWhen Marcian became emperor, he was influenced by Flavius Zeno, Pulcheria, and Aspar. Flavius Zeno died soon after Marcian ascended the throne, possibly as early as the end of 451,{{sfn|Nathan|1998}}{{sfn|Lee|2013|p=97}} and Pulcheria died in July 453, leaving Aspar as the only major influence in the court of the Eastern Roman Empire.

Despite Aspar's great influence, the Eastern Roman elites retained much of their anti-German sentiment.{{sfn|Nathan|1998}} Marcian's principal advisors were Pulcheria, [[Euphemius (Magister officiorum)|Euphemius]] the {{lang|la|[[magister officiorum]]}} (master of offices), [[Palladius (praetor)|Palladius]] the praetor, and [[Anatolius of Constantinople]].{{sfn|Grant|1985|p=305}} In 453, Marcian had his daughter from a previous marriage, [[Marcia Euphemia]], marry [[Anthemius]], an aristocrat and talented general.{{sfn|Nathan|1998}}{{sfn|Dzino|Parry|2017|p=258}}\n\nMarcian patronized the Blues, who were one of the [[Deme#Later usage|two circus teams]], the other being the Greens. The two teams had become more like political parties than sports teams by his time, wielding large influence in the empire; both vied for power. After the Greens responded angrily to his patronage, Marcus censured them, forbidding any of them to hold any public office for three years. Marcian's patronage of the Blues may have had personal motivations, as the once powerful Chrysaphius had been favorable to the Greens.{{sfn|Nathan|1998}}{{sfn|Christophilopoulou|1986|p=286}}{{sfn|Bury|1923|p=85}}\n\n===Foreign relations===\nThe Armenian king [[Vardan II Mamikonian]], who was leading a revolt against the Sassanian Empire, sent an embassy to Theodosius in 450, composed of his brother [[Hmayeak Mamikonian]], along with [[Atom Gnuni]], [[Vardan Amatuni]], and [[Meruzhan Artsruni (emissary)|Meruzhan Artsruni]], to ask for assistance. Theodosius received it favorably. Any plans were cut short by his death and the accession of Marcian.{{Sfn|Manoogian|1984|p=23}}{{Sfn|Lacey|2016|p=142}} Marcian was counseled by the diplomat [[Anatolius (consul)|Anatolius]] and {{lang|la|patricius}} [[Florentius (consul 429)|Florentius]] not to make war with the Sassanians, as it would engulf a large amount of the Eastern Roman military resources, and thus Marcian did not agree to help them.{{sfn|Jones|Martindale|Morris|1980|pp=85\u201386}}{{sfn|Amirav|2015|p=55 & 93}}\n\nKing [[Gubazes I of Lazica]]\u2014a Caucasian state in theory under Eastern Roman suzerainty\u2014was attempting to form an alliance with the Sassanians to break free of Roman control in 456.{{sfn|Mikaberidze|2015|p=346}} Marcian's troops invaded Lazica and restored Roman rule.{{sfn|Elton|2018|p=174}} In 455 Marcian banned the export to barbarian tribes of weapons and the tools used to manufacture them.{{sfn|Holmes|Singleton|Jones|2001}}\n\n===Relationship with the Western Roman Empire===\nMarcian was elected without any consultation with the Western Roman Emperor, Valentinian&nbsp;III\u2013 a clear indication of further separation between the Eastern and Western Roman Empires than before his reign.{{sfn|Gallagher|2008|p=243}}{{sfn|Lee|2001|p=42}} Valentinian would later recognize Marcian as the Eastern Roman Emperor, although the date of his recognition is disputed; Lee states that Valentinian recognized Marcian in March 452,{{sfn|Lee|2001|p=43}} whereas historian [[Timothy E. Gregory]] states that Marcian was recognized by Valentinian on 30 March 451.{{sfn|Gregory|1991|p=1296}} Marcian{{'}}s appointment marked a further stage of separation between the Eastern and Western Roman Empires.{{sfn|Gallagher|2008|p=243}} One source, [[John of Antioch (chronicler)|John of Antioch's]] {{lang|la|Excerpta de insidiis}}, even suggest that Valentinian would have attempted to depose Marcian, but for Aetius{{'}} opposition.{{sfn|Lee|2001|p=43f}} Valentinian also did not recognize the Eastern Roman consuls for 451 or 452.{{sfn|McEvoy|2013|p=290, note 84}} The Western Roman chronicler [[Hydatius]] suggests that Marcian made Eastern Roman troops available to Valentinian to repel the Huns, confusingly led by a man named Aetius, which may simply be a muddling of Aetius' campaign against Attila and Marcian's campaign against the Huns on the Danube.{{sfn|McEvoy|2013|p=294}}\n\nWhen Marcian granted part of Pannonia to the Ostrogoths, and [[Tisza]] to the Gepids, he was accused of encroaching upon the border of Western Roman land.{{sfn|Grant|1985|p=307}} Marcian avoided involving himself with the affairs of the Western Roman Empire when possible. When the Vandals [[Sack of Rome (455)|sacked Rome]] in 455, after [[Petronius Maximus]] assassinated Valentinian&nbsp;III and broke an [[engagement]] treaty with the Vandals, Marcian did not respond violently, possibly due to the influence of Aspar. He merely sent an envoy demanding that the Vandals return the [[Dowager Empress]], [[Licinia Eudoxia]] and her daughters by Valentinian III, [[Placidia]] and [[Eudocia (daughter of Valentinian&nbsp;III)|Eudocia]].{{sfn|Nathan|1998}} A likely false account is given that Marcian, while captured by the Vandals in his youth, was shaded by an eagle while the other prisoners suffered the hot sun. According to this account, the Vandal King Gaiseric recognized that Marcian would later be emperor. In exchange for being released, he made Marcia pledge not to attack the Vandals should he become emperor.{{efn|name=A|Propaganda involving the story of an eagle blocking the sun, and another figure recognizing they would be emperor, was used by both Byzantine emperors [[Philippikos Bardanes]] and [[Basil&nbsp;I]].{{sfn|Lilie|2014|p=193}}}} This account originates from [[Priscus]], who served as an advisor to Marcian's confidant, Euphemius. Due to Euphemius' influence over foreign policy, some historians, such as [[Edward Arthur Thompson]], have suggested that this account was a part of official imperial propaganda, which was generated to excuse Marcian's lack of retribution towards the Vandals, and quell any discontent.{{sfn|Thompson|1950|p=68}} Marcian made several diplomatic attempts to have the prisoners returned, before finally beginning to plan an invasion of the Vandal's territory shortly before his death.{{sfn|Clover|1978|pp=193\u2013194}} The historian [[Frank Clover]] has suggested that this sudden reversal of policy was caused by the marriage of Eudocia to [[Huneric]], the son of Gaiseric, which led to such pressure from Eastern Roman elites that Marcian was forced to begin preparations for war to ensure the return of the hostages. Around this time, Marcian made peace with Lazica, which would allow him to direct his attention elsewhere. The East Roman historian [[Theodorus Lector]] speaks of Marcian's sudden reversal of policy, and [[Evagrius Scholasticus]], a Roman historian writing a century after the event, states that the Vandals released Licinia Eudoxia, Placidia, and Eudocia to Marcian after he threatened them with war, in either late 556 or early 557.{{sfn|Clover|1978|p=194}}{{sfn|Mathisen|1981|p=243}}\n\nMarcian did not recognize any Western Emperor after Valentinian, denying Petronius Maximus, now Western Emperor, when he sent an embassy requesting it, and similarly refusing to recognize [[Avitus]], who succeeded Maximus.{{sfn|Gregory|1991|p=1296}}{{sfn|Kazhdan|1991|p=704}} Marcian's exact treatment of Avitus is debated. The Roman historian [[Hydatius]] states that in 455 Avitus sent ambassadors to Marcian \"for the sake of unanimity of power,\" and that, \"Marcian and Avitus make use of Roman power in concord\". The exact usage of concord ({{lang|la|concordia}} in the original Latin) has led to debate among scholars. Some such as [[Thomas Hodgkin (historian)|Thomas Hodgkin]], [[J. B. Bury]], and [[William Bayless]] consider it grounds for the belief that Marcian may have recognized Avitus. Most scholars take a more conservative stance on it; [[Ernst Stein]] suggests that it is merely a reflection of West Roman propaganda, whereas [[Norman Baynes]] believes it indicates that Marcian was cordial to Avitus, neither hostile nor friendly.{{sfn|Mathisen|1981|p=237}}{{sfn|Baynes|1922|p=223}} Classicist [[Courtenay Edward Stevens]] interprets the phrase as meaning only that the meeting of the diplomats was amicable, rather than reflecting a relationship between the two states.{{sfn|Mathisen|1981|p=237}}\n\nThe historian [[Geoffrey Nathan]] suggests the fact that only two Western delegates attended the Council of Chalcedon points to a new level of Western Roman self-absorption in their own political and religious affairs. He mentions that the canon from this council delegating authority over the whole east to the See of Constantinople marks a religious separation. Authority over the Church in the Eastern Roman Empire would prove a point of contention between Rome and Constantinople, leading up to the [[East\u2013West Schism]].{{sfn|Nathan|1998}}\n\n==Death==\nMarcian's reign ended on 26 January 457, when he died, possibly of [[gangrene]].{{sfn|Lee|2013|p=98}}{{sfn|Meijer|2004|p=154}} [[Theodorus Lector]] and [[Theophanes the Confessor]] say that Marcian died after a long religious procession from the [[Great Palace of Constantinople|Grand Palace]] to the [[Hebdomon]], where he made the journey on foot, despite the fact that he could barely walk due to severe foot [[inflammation]], possibly [[gout]].{{sfn|Nathan|1998}}{{sfn|Meijer|2004|p=154}}{{sfn|Kelly|2013|p=240}} He was buried in the [[Church of the Holy Apostles]], in Constantinople, next to his wife Pulcheria,{{sfn|Nathan|1998}}{{sfn|Meijer|2004|p=154}} in a [[Porphyry (geology)#Imperial sarcophagi|porphyry sarcophagus]] that was described in the 10th century by [[Constantine VII|Constantine VII Porphyrogenitus]] in the {{lang|la|[[De Ceremoniis]]}}.{{sfn|Vasiliev|1948|pp=p1 & 3\u201326}} He left the Eastern Empire with seven million [[solidi]] in its treasury, an impressive achievement considering the economic ruin inflicted upon Eastern Rome by the Huns, both through warfare and the massive subsidies they received under Theodosius.{{sfn|Friell|Williams|2005|p=127}} \n\nAlthough Marcian had a son-in-law, Anthemius, he did not have any connection to the Theodosians, which Marcian himself had gained through his marriage to Pulcheria, and thus would not be considered a legitimate dynastic heir, so Aspar was once again left to play the role of emperor-maker. He selected [[Leo I the Thracian|Leo&nbsp;I]], a fifty-year-old officer commanding a unit in one of the praesental armies\u2014two field armies based near Constantinople. A later source claims that the [[Eastern Roman Senate]] offered to elect Aspar himself, but he declined, with the cryptic comment: \"I fear that a tradition in ruling might be initiated through me\". This comment has often been interpreted to be a reference to the fact that he was an [[Arian]],{{sfn|Nathan|1998}}{{sfn|Lee|2013|pp=92, 98}}{{sfn|Meijer|2004|p=154}} or else to his Alanic heritage.{{sfn|Norwich|1998|p=51}}\n\nAnthemius would later be sent by Leo to become the [[Western Roman]] [[Roman Emperor|emperor]];{{Sfn|Nathan|1998}}{{sfn|Dzino|Parry|2017|p=258}}{{sfn|Mathisen|1998}} Leo nominated him to be Western Emperor in the spring of 467, to fill the vacancy left by the death of Emperor [[Libius Severus]] since 465. Leo sent Anthemius to Rome with an army, headed by [[Marcellinus (magister militum)|Marcellinus]], the {{lang|la|magister militum}} of [[Dalmatia (Roman province)|Dalmatia]]; upon nearing Rome, Anthemius was installed as emperor on 12 April 467.{{sfn|Mathisen|1998}}\n\n==Legacy==\n[[File:20111224 Flavius Marcianus Augustus Column Fatih Istanbul Turkey.jpg|thumb|upright|alt=Color photograph of an ancient stone column set in front of a modern building and parked cars.

Some later scholars attribute his success not just to his skill, but also to a large degree of luck: not only had he been fortunate enough to have Pulcheria to legitimize his rule, for much of it the two greatest external threats to Rome, the Sassanian Empire and the Huns, were absorbed with their own internal problems; additionally, no natural disasters or plagues occurred during his reign.{{sfn|Nathan|1998}}{{sfn|Grant|1985|p=306}}{{sfn|Gregory|1991|p=1297}} He was remembered fondly by the people of Constantinople, who would shout \"Reign like Marcian!\" at the installation of future emperors.{{sfn|Grant|1985|p=307}}\n\nThe Prefect of Constantinople [[Tatianus]] built a [[Column of Marcian|column]] dedicated to Marcian, sometime between 450 and 452.{{sfn|Jones|Martindale|Morris|1980|pp=1053\u20131054}}{{sfn|D'Ayala |Fodde |2008|p=1167}} It still stands in Istanbul, near the north branch of the [[Mese (Constantinople)|Mese]],{{sfn|Gallagher|2008|p=204}} though the statue of Marcian that originally topped it has been lost.{{sfn|Freely|\u00c7akmak|2004|p=63}} Marcian also had a statue in the [[Forum of Arcadius]], which contained the statues of several of the successors of Emperor [[Arcadius]].{{sfn|Kazhdan|1991a|p=1347}} Marcian may have been the sponsor of the [[Chrysotriklinos]] of the Great Palace of Constantinople. The {{lang|la|[[Patria of Constantinople]]}} states that Marcian constructed it, whereas the 10th century encyclopedia {{lang|la|[[Suda]]}} states that Emperor [[Justin&nbsp;II]] built it, a view with which most historians agree.

Very little of his life before becoming emperor is known, other than that he was a {{lang|la|[[Domesticus (Roman Empire)|domesticus]]}} (personal assistant) who served under the commanders [[Ardabur (consul 427)|Ardabur]] and his son [[Aspar]] for fifteen years. After the death of Emperor [[Theodosius&nbsp;II]] on 28 July 450, Marcian was made a candidate for the throne by Aspar, who held much influence because of his military power. After a month of negotiations [[Pulcheria]],  Theodosius' sister, agreed to marry Marcian. [[Flavius Zeno]], a military leader whose influence was similar to Aspar's, may have been involved in these negotiations, as he was given the high-ranking court title of {{lang|la|[[Patrician (ancient Rome)#Late Roman and Byzantine periods|patrician]]}} upon Marcian's accession. Marcian was elected and inaugurated on 25 August 450.\n\nMarcian reversed many of the actions of Theodosius{{nbsp}}II in the [[Eastern Roman Empire]]'s relationship with the [[Hunnic Empire|Huns]] under [[Attila]] and in religious matters. Marcian almost immediately revoked all treaties with Attila, ending all subsidy payments to him. In 452, while Attila was raiding Italy, then a part of the [[Western Roman Empire]], Marcian launched expeditions across the [[Danube]] into the [[Great Hungarian Plain]], defeating the [[Huns]] in their own heartland. This action, accompanied by the famine and plague that broke out in northern Italy, allowed the Western Roman Empire to bribe Attila into retreating from the Italian peninsula.\n\nAfter Attila's death in 453, Marcian took advantage of the resulting fragmentation of the Hunnic confederation by settling [[Germanic peoples|Germanic]] tribes within Roman lands as {{lang|la|[[foederati]]}} (\"federates\" providing military service in exchange for benefits). Marcian also convened the [[Council of Chalcedon]], which declared that [[Jesus]] had two \"[[Nature (philosophy)|natures]]\": divine and human. This led to the alienation of the population of the eastern provinces of [[Byzantine Syria|Syria]] and [[Byzantine Egypt|Egypt]], as many of them were [[miaphysites]], rejecting the new official [[Christology]]. Marcian died on 26 January 457, leaving the Eastern Roman Empire with a treasury surplus of seven million [[solidi]] coins, an impressive achievement considering the economic ruin inflicted upon the Eastern Roman Empire by the Huns and Theodosius' tribute payments. After his death, Aspar passed over Marcian's son-in-law, [[Anthemius]], and had a military commander, [[Leo I the Thracian|Leo&nbsp;I]], elected as emperor.\n\n==Early life==\nMarcian was born in {{circa}} 392,{{sfn|Meijer|2004|p=153}}{{sfn|Nathan|1998}} in either [[Thracia|Thrace]]{{sfn|Vasiliev|1980|p=104}} or [[Praetorian prefecture of Illyricum|Illyria]],{{sfn|Nathan|1998}} named Flavius Marcianus.{{sfn|Keppie|2002|p=137}} The ancient historian [[John Malalas]] describes him as being tall and having some sort of foot impediment.{{sfn|Baldwin|1982 |p=98}} Little of Marcian's early life is known. His father had served in the military and at a young age Marcian enlisted at [[Philippopolis (Thracia)|Philippopolis]] in Thrace. By the time of the [[Roman\u2013Sasanian War (421\u2013422)|Roman\u2013Sassanian War of 421\u2013422]], Marcian had likely reached the military rank of [[Military tribune|tribune]]\u2014the historian [[Theophanes the Confessor]] mentions him commanding a military unit. He did not see action in the war, having become ill in [[Lycia]]. There he was cared for by [[Tatianus (Praefectus urbi)|Tatianus]], who would be made {{lang|la|[[praefectus urbi]]}} (prefect of Constantinople) by Marcian, and Tatianus' brother [[Iulius (praeses)|Iulius]].{{sfn|Nathan|1998}}{{sfn|Jones|Martindale|Morris|1980|pp=714\u2013715}}{{sfn|Friell|Williams|2005|p=84}}{{sfn|Lee|2013|p=96}} Marcian eventually rose to become the {{lang|la|[[Domesticus (Roman Empire)|domesticus]]}} (personal assistant) of [[Aspar]], the {{lang|la|[[magister militum]]}} (commander-in-chief) of the Eastern Roman Empire. Despite being half-[[Alans|Alanic]] and half-[[Goths|Gothic]], Aspar held much influence in the empire.{{sfn|Nathan|1998}}{{sfn|Lee|2013|p=96}}{{sfn|Friell|Williams|2005|pp=45, 75, 84}} In the early 430s, Marcian served under Aspar in [[Africa (Roman province)|Roman Africa]], where he was captured by [[Vandals]]. [[Evagrius Scholasticus]], [[Procopius]] and later authors give a likely false account in which Marcian, while in captivity, met the Vandal king [[Gaiseric]], who predicted he would later become emperor. After his capture, Marcian is not mentioned again until the death of the eastern emperor, [[Theodosius&nbsp;II]].{{sfn|Nathan|1998}}\n\n==Background==\n===Reign of Theodosius II===\nThe Eastern Roman Empire was plagued by external threats during the reign of Theodosius&nbsp;II. In 429 the Vandals, led by Gaiseric, began to conquer Roman Africa. Theodosius immediately organized a response, sending Aspar and three other commanders to attempt to repel them in the summer of 431. To the north, the [[Huns]], who had customarily attacked the empire whenever its armies were preoccupied, withdrawing as those forces returned, sent ambassadors to Theodosius in 431, demanding tribute. He agreed to their demand to pay {{convert|350|lb}} of gold each year. In 434, the Eastern Roman armies were still campaigning against the Vandals in Africa, having faced initial defeats and the withdrawal of many of the Western Roman soldiers. In the face of Eastern Roman weakness, the Huns doubled their demand, asking for {{convert|700|lb}} of gold per year, which Theodosius agreed to. The threat the Huns posed to his weakly protected empire was enough that Theodosius recalled a large number of his forces from Africa. With large numbers of the Eastern Roman armies home, and [[Attila]], who had just taken power in the Hunnic Confederation, busy campaigning to the north, Theodosius refused to pay the tribute and continued to refuse to until 439.{{sfn|Thompson|1950|pp=60\u201365}} \n\nOn 19 October 439, the Vandals defeated the weakened Eastern Roman armies and captured the major city of [[Carthage]]. Both the Western and Eastern Roman Empires began preparing a massive counter-offensive, stripping the Balkan provinces of protection. In the spring of 440, 1,100 ships set sail from Constantinople for Africa;{{sfn|Thompson|1950|pp=60\u201365}} sending away such a large number of the Eastern Roman forces was a huge gamble on Theodosius' part. He was betting the fortified cities along the [[Danube]] could delay the Huns long enough for the invasion force to gain a secure foothold in Africa, allowing troops to be withdrawn back to the northern frontier. This gamble worked until 442 when the bishop of [[Margus (city)|Margus]] led a raiding party into the Huns' territory and desecrated their royal tombs. In response to this desecration, Attila demanded that the bishop be handed over. To ensure his own safety, the bishop struck a deal with Attila, surrendering the city of Margus to him in exchange for his own life. With control of Margus, Attila had a foothold across the Danube, which he aggressively exploited, capturing and destroying the cities of [[Viminacium]], [[Singidunum]], and [[Sirmium]]. Theodosius recalled Aspar to Constantinople and launched a counterattack. After his force was decisively defeated, Theodosius undertook to pay tribute to the Huns every year, which he did until his death in 450.{{sfn|Thompson|1950|pp=60\u201378}}\n\n===Rise to the throne===\nAfter Theodosius&nbsp;II died unexpectedly in a riding accident on 28 July 450, the Eastern Roman Empire faced its first [[succession crisis]] in 60 years. Theodosius had no sons, nor had he designated a successor.{{sfn|Nathan|1998}}{{sfn|Lee|2013|p=94}} Some later sources state that he willed the throne to Marcian on his deathbed, but this is thought to be propaganda created by Marcian's supporters after his election.{{Sfn|Nathan|1998}} Marcian had served Aspar and his father [[Ardabur (consul 427)|Ardabur]] loyally for fifteen years. Aspar conspired to have Marcian elected and was able to negotiate with other powerful figures to have him made the emperor, despite his relative obscurity.{{sfn|Lee|2013|p=96}} There was a one-month interregnum where negotiations for the succession took place, one of which was with Pulcheria, Theodosius&nbsp;II's sister, who agreed to marry Marcian;{{sfn|Lee|2013|p=96}} it is thought that Pulcheria agreed to marry Marcian on the condition that he would abandon Theodosius II{{'}}s religious policies and convoke a Church council.{{sfn|Lee|2013|p=104}} Their marriage helped to legitimize Marcian's rule, as Pulcheria's family, the [[Theodosian dynasty]], had direct ties to the throne.{{sfn|Lee|2013|p=96}} Despite being married to Marcian, Pulcheria kept the vow of [[virginity]] she had made in 413, at age 14, during her three years of marriage to him.{{sfn|Lee|2013|p=96}}{{sfn|Smith|2008|p=537}}{{sfn|Holum|1989|p=209}} \n\nHistorian [[Doug Lee (historian)|Doug Lee]] proposes that negotiations were also needed between Aspar and [[Flavius Zeno]], who was in a similar position of military power. Zeno was given the prestigious rank of [[patrician (ancient Rome)|patrician]] upon Marcian's ascension in 450, suggesting a deal whereby Zeno was rewarded for supporting Marcian instead of claiming the throne for himself;{{sfn|Lee|2013|p=96}} Zeno would ultimately die within a year of Marcian{{'}}s accession.{{sfn|Lee|2013|p=98}} Aspar{{'s}} son, [[Ardabur (consul 447)|Ardabur]], was promoted to command the army of the [[Praetorian prefecture of the East|Perfecture of the East]] as the new {{lang|la|[[magister militum per Orientem]]}}, soon after Marcian's accession.{{sfn|Nathan|1998}}{{sfn|Lee|2013|p=98}}{{sfn|Lee|2001|p=43}}\n\nMarcian was elected on 25 August 450, with Pulcheria herself crowning him emperor, a unique event symbolizing that the imperial power was shared, and likely to boost Marcian's legitimacy further.{{Sfn|Nathan|1998}} Marcian took the regnal name of Imperator Caesar Flavius Marcianus Augustus upon his coronation.{{sfn|Babcock|2005|p=157}} The election of Marcian in 450 resulted in large changes to eastern imperial policy. [[Chrysaphius]], the [[eunuch]] and {{lang|la|[[spatharios]]}} (guard of the imperial chambers), who had exercised much influence over Theodosius, was either murdered or executed. Both Pulcheria and Zeno were opposed to Chrysaphius' influence, which may have motivated Marcian's actions. Marcian took a tougher stance against the Huns and a more direct role in ecclesiastical affairs. [[Byzantine studies|Byzantist]] [[Constance Head]] considers Marcian to be an \"an independent-minded emperor.\"{{sfn|Head|1982|p=20}} Lee states that Marcian \"can appear as a stronger figure than many other fifth-century incumbents of the imperial office\", but notes that \"Flavius Zeno and Pulcheria had both been opponents of Chrysaphius, so the changes may be more a reflection of their influence.\"{{sfn|Nathan|1998}}{{sfn|Lee|2013|pp=97\u201398}}\n\n==Reign==\n===Conflict with the Huns===\n[[File:450 roman-hunnic-empire 1764x1116.jpg|right|Alt=A map of Europe showing the territories of the Hunnic confederation and the Roman Empire | A map of Europe in 450 AD, showing the Hunnic confederation under Attila in orange, and the Roman Empire in yellow|thumb|upright=2|alt=A colored drawing of Europe in 450 AD, showing the borders of states at the time of Attila by different colors, with the Roman Empire in yellow, the Hunnic Confederation in orange, the Vandal Kingdom in blue, the Franks in green, the Goths in pink, the Sueves in purple, the Saxons in light pink, the Burgundians in brown, the Lombards in bright yellow, and the Alans in light blue.]]\nAlmost immediately after becoming emperor, Marcian revoked Theodosius' treaties with Attila and proclaimed the end of subsidies. He stated that he might grant gifts if Attila was friendly, but Attila would be repelled if he attempted to raid the Eastern Roman Empire. At this time Attila was preparing to invade the Western Roman Empire, under the guise of helping Emperor [[Valentinian&nbsp;III]] against the [[Visigoths]]. Attila reacted angrily to Marcian's proposal, demanding tribute, but did not alter his invasion plans. He led his horde from [[Pannonia]] in spring 451 into the Western Roman Empire.{{sfn|Friell|Williams|2005|p=84}} [[Flavius Aetius]], who was the supreme commander of the Western Roman army as {{lang|la|[[Comes et Magister Utriusque Militiae]]}}, organized a defense and called upon the Visigoths, [[Franks]], [[Burgundians]], Alans, Saxons, Celtic [[Armorica]]ns, and other tribal groups numbering about 60,000 to aid him. Attila's forces were made up of [[Gepids]], Alans, [[Scirii]], [[Heruli (military unit)|Heruli]], [[Rugii|Rugians]], along with a number of Franks, Burgundians, and [[Ostrogoths]].{{sfn|Friell|Williams|2005|p=85}}\n\nAttila sacked [[Metz]] and attempted a siege of [[Orleans]], before meeting Aetius' forces at the [[Battle of the Catalaunian Plains]], in northeast [[Gaul]]. This battle involved around 100,000 men and resulted in very large losses on both sides. After the battle, Attila retreated to the [[Great Hungarian Plain]], and Aetius dismissed his coalition of tribes, sending them back to their own territories. In spring 452, Attila again launched a raid, into Italy, which was almost entirely undefended. He was likely motivated by a desire for revenge, along with a need to raid to stabilize his tribal state, which was dependent upon raiding for loot and resources. Attila captured the city of [[Aquileia]] after a long and difficult siege,{{sfn|Friell|Williams|2005|p=86}} and [[looted|sacked]] it. He then raided across northern Italy, taking [[Mediolanum]] ([[Milan]]) and other important cities. There was much fear that Attila would attack [[Rome]] itself, the walls of which were weaker than those of some cities he had already captured. During this period, other than cutting his [[lines of communication]] and harassing his rear forces, Aetius did not launch a direct attack on Attila.{{sfn|Friell|Williams|2005|p=87}}\n\nDespite the plunder he now had from capturing Aquileia, Milan, and other cities, Attila was quickly placed in a precarious situation, because of the actions of both Eastern and Western Rome. In Italy, he was seriously lacking in funds, having not received subsidies from either Eastern or Western Rome for two years. Constant warfare had depleted his forces. In addition, Attila's homeland was threatened by the Eastern Empire which, despite the punitive raids he ordered, took the offensive against the Great Hungarian Plain in mid-452, attacking across the Danube and inflicting a defeat upon the Huns.{{sfn|Friell|Williams|2005|p=87}} The area attacked by the Eastern Romans was home to Ostrogoths and Gepids, two groups bitterly opposed to Hunnic rule, and was the [[breadbasket]] of the Hunnic Empire. The loss of food supply from Attila's own land coupled with a famine that Italy was suffering at the time, along with a plague that followed it, placed yet more strain upon Attila, allowing the Western Roman Empire to bribe him into retreating to his homeland. After returning to the Great Hungarian Plain, he threatened to invade the Eastern Empire the following spring and conquer it entirely.{{sfn|Friell|Williams|2005|p=87}}{{sfn|Thompson|1950|p=70}} Marcian and Aspar ignored his threats. They reasoned, based upon the previous treaties that Attila had broken, that he could not be permanently deterred even by tons of gold. The pair believed the gold would be better spent building up armies, not appeasing threats. Also, the rich Asian and African provinces, which were protected behind Constantinople, were secure enough to allow the Eastern Empire to retake any European provinces it might lose. This campaign never came to fruition, as Attila died unexpectedly in 453, either from [[hemorrhaging]] or alcoholic [[suffocation]], after celebrating a marriage to one of his many wives. After his death, his tribal confederation rapidly fell apart, starting first with rebellions of the Ostrogoths.{{sfn|Friell|Williams|2005|p=88}}\n\nThis fragmentation allowed the Eastern Empire to resume its policy of playing off barbarians against each other, to stop any one tribe from becoming too powerful. It is almost certain that the Gepid king [[Ardaric]] came to an agreement with Marcian. Ardaric had formed a coalition of the Rugians, Sciri, Heruli, and his own Gepids, which he led against the remaining Hunnic confederation. Ardaric, alongside the Ostrogoth leaders [[Theodemir (Ostrogothic king)|Theodemir]], [[Valamir]] and [[Videmir]], decisively defeated Attila's oldest son, [[Ellac]], at the [[Battle of Nedao]] in 455, where he was slain. After this battle, the Hunnic confederation fell apart entirely. In the wake of the collapse of the Hunnic Empire, Marcian accepted the Ostrogoths, who had established themselves in [[Pannonia Prima]] and [[Pannonia Valeria|Valeria]]\u2014nominally two Western Roman provinces\u2014as {{lang|la|[[foederati]]}}.{{sfn|Nathan|1998}}{{sfn|Friell|Williams|2005|pp=89\u201391}}{{sfn|Elton|2018|p=172}} This marked the continuation of the tacit abandonment of a [[Danube\u2013Iller\u2013Rhine Limes|rigid Danube barrier]], which had previously been manned by Roman {{lang|la|[[laeti]]}}, barbarians settled directly in Roman land in exchange for military service. For some time before Marcian, the {{lang|la|laeti}} had been replaced by {{lang|la|foederati}}, although the distinction between the two was increasingly breaking down. Marcian's successors would grant the status of {{lang|la|foederati}} to multiple peoples and ceding them lands in the recovered European provinces: the Rugians in eastern Thrace, Sciri in [[Lower Moesia]] and [[Scythia]], Gepids in [[Diocese of Dacia|Dacia]]. This network of subject peoples, who were generally reliable and manageable, was beneficial to the Eastern Empire. The various tribal peoples generally kept each other's power in check without Roman intervention. They could also be induced to serve the empire against its enemies by way of gifts, subsidies, and treaties.{{sfn|Nathan|1998}}{{sfn|Friell|Williams|2005|pp=89\u201391}} After the death of Attila, Marcian enjoyed a relatively peaceful reign, although he won some small campaigns against the [[Saracens]] in [[Roman Syria|Syria]] and against the [[Blemmyes]] in [[Roman Egypt|Egypt]].{{sfn|Nathan|1998}}{{sfn|Gregory|1991|p=1296}}\n\n===Religious policy===\n[[File:Fourth ecumenical council of chalcedon - 1876.jpg|thumb|''Fourth Ecumenical Council of Chalcedon'', 1876&nbsp;painting by [[Vasily Surikov]]|alt=A wall painting of the Council of Chalcedon showing Marcian and Pulcheria seated on thrones.]]\nDuring the time period of the 5th century, a central religious issue was the debate concerning how the human and divine nature of [[Jesus Christ]] were associated, following the [[Arian controversy]]. The [[Catechetical School of Alexandria|School of Alexandria]], including theologians such as [[Athanasius]], asserted the equality of Christ and God, and therefore focused upon the divinity of Christ. The [[School of Antioch]], including theologians such as [[Theodore of Mopsuestia]], determined not to lose the human aspect of Christ, focused upon his humanity.{{sfn|Lee|2013|p=137}}\n\nShortly before Marcian became emperor, the [[Second Council of Ephesus]] was held in 449. The council stated that Jesus had one divine united nature, called {{lang|la|[[miaphysitism|miaphysis]]}}; this was rejected by the [[Pope]] and the [[Patriarch of Constantinople]] due to disputes on the matter of [[Christology]], as the Pope and Patriarch of Constantinople saw the belief in miaphysis as [[heretical]].{{sfn|Lee|2013|p=145}}{{sfn|Vasiliev|1980|pp=99 & 105}}{{sfn|Davis|2004|p=81}} \n\nTo repudiate the Second Council of Ephesus, Marcian convened a new council of the imperial church, deemed to pass [[ecumenical council|universally respected canons]], in 451. Pulcheria may have influenced this decision or even made the convention of a council a requirement during her negotiations with Aspar to marry Marcian. The council was to take place near Constantinople so that the government could watch the proceedings closely. Initially, it was to be held at the city of [[Nicaea]], which held enormous religious importance to the early church, as it was the site of its first council, the [[First Council of Nicaea]] in 325. However, Marcian successfully requested the transfer of the location to [[Chalcedon]]. This was closer to Constantinople and would allow him to respond quickly to any events along the Danube frontier. The [[Council of Chalcedon]] met in October 451. About 500 [[bishops]] attended it, most of them Eastern Roman, although two African bishops and two Papal legates sent by [[Pope Leo&nbsp;I]] attended.{{sfn|Lee|2013|p=145}}{{sfn|Gallagher|2008|p=585}}{{sfn|Whitworth|2017|p=360}} This council condemned the Second Council of Ephesus and agreed that Jesus had a divine nature ({{lang|la|[[physis]]}}) and a human nature, united in one person ({{lang|la|[[Hypostasis (philosophy and religion)|hypostasis]]}}), \"without confusion, change, division, or separation.\"{{sfn|Lee|2013|p=146}}\n\nThe council also agreed to condemn the Coptic [[Pope Dioscorus&nbsp;I of Alexandria]], who had overseen the Second Council of Ephesus, and revoke the condemnations of [[Ibas of Edessa]] and [[Theodoret]], which had taken place during this Council. The council also repeated the importance of the [[See of Constantinople]], placing it firmly in second place behind the See of Rome, and giving it the right to appoint bishops in the Eastern Roman Empire, over the objection of Pope Leo I;{{sfn|Nathan|1998}}{{sfn|Lee|2013|p=147}}{{sfn|Lee|2001|p=814}} the Patriarchs of Alexandria also objected to the elevation of the See of Constantinople.{{sfn|Bauer|2010|p=122}} The council ended in November 451, after which Marcian issued numerous [[edicts]] confirming the outcomes of the council;{{sfn|Nathan|1998}}{{sfn|Lee|2013|p=147}}{{sfn|Lee|2001|p=814}} showing that the outcome of the council was not universally accepted.{{sfn|Lee|2013|p=148}} One such edict ordered the repression of [[Eutychianism|Eutychianists]], who did not believe in the hypostatic union of Jesus' two natures, barring them from holding state offices, forbidding them from criticizing the Council of Chalcedon, and ordering their literature, along with that of the [[Nestorians]], to be burned.{{sfn|Bury|2012|p=380}} \n\nThe anti-Miaphysite resolutions of the council led to a large increase in civil disruption in the eastern provinces of Syria and Egypt, where the majority of the population was Miaphysitic. Several violent revolts were put down with military force after significant bloodshed, in Jerusalem, Alexandria, and Antioch;{{Sfn|Vasiliev|1980|p=105}} as well as sending the military to suppress monks in [[Palaestina Prima|Palestine]]<!--Please note that this was the proper Roman name for the province and has no relation to the modern Israel\u2013Palestine debates.--> and placing troops in [[Alexandria]] to ensure the installation of [[Proterius of Alexandria]], who was to replace the deposed [[Pope Dioscorus I of Alexandria|Pope Dioscorus I]].{{sfn|Nathan|1998}} According to the Byzantist [[Alexander Vasiliev (historian)|Alexander Vasiliev]], even after these revolts were put down, the popular dissatisfaction with the state church among the Miaphysite and Nestorian population remained, as the eastern provinces became increasingly convinced of their need for independence from the Eastern Roman Empire. Vasiliev states that this would lead to long-lasting disloyalty toward the Eastern Roman government among the eastern provinces, ultimately facilitating the loss of these provinces to the Sassanians and later to the [[Arabs]].{{Sfn|Vasiliev|1980|pp=105\u2013106}} As an additional result of the council and the following edicts, many Christians who disagreed with the council, including many Nestorians, migrated to the [[Sassanian Empire]].{{sfn|Bauer|2010|pp=122\u2013123}} The separation of the Miaphysites from the churches accepting Chalcedonian doctrine would be made final after the failed attempts of reconciliation under Emperor [[Justinian I]] ({{Reign|527|565}}), with the Miaphysites splitting the [[Oriental Orthodox Churches]] from the main body of Christians.{{sfn|Meyendorff|1989|pp=194\u2013202}}\n\nMarcian also funded Pulcheria's extensive building projects until her death in July 453.

Marcian reversed this near bankruptcy, not by levying new taxes, but by cutting expenditure.{{sfn|Bury|2012|pp=236\u2013237}} Upon his accession, he declared a remission of all debts owed to the state.{{sfn|Nathan|1998}} Marcian attempted to improve the efficiency of the state in multiple ways.{{sfn|Bury|2012|pp=236\u2013237}} Marcian laid out legal reforms in his [[Novel (Roman law)|novels]], or codes of law, containing 20 laws, many of which were targeted at reducing the corruption and abuses of office that had existed during the reign of Theodosius; five of which are preserved in full.{{sfn|Jones|1986|p=217}}{{sfn|Pharr|Davidson|Pharr|2001|p=562}}\n\nMarcian mandated that the office of [[praetorship]] (officer in charge of public games and works) could only be given to [[Byzantine Senate#Admission and composition|senators]] who resided in Constantinople, attempted to curb the practice of selling administrative offices, and decreed that [[Roman consul|consuls]] should be responsible for the maintenance of [[Valens Aqueduct|Constantinople's aqueducts]]. He repealed the {{lang|la|[[Follis (tax)|follis]]}}, a tax on senators' property that amounted to seven pounds of gold per annum.{{sfn|Bury|2012|pp=236\u2013237}} Marcian removed the financial responsibilities of the [[Roman consul|consuls]] and praetors, held since the time of the [[Roman Republic]], to fund public sports and games or give wealth to the citizens of Constantinople, respectively. In addition, he made it so that only a {{lang|la|[[vir illustris]]}} (a high-ranking man) could hold either office.{{sfn|Nathan|1998}} He also partially repealed a marriage law enacted by [[Constantine I]], which decreed that a man of senatorial status could not marry a slave, [[freedwoman]], actress, or woman of no social status ({{lang|la|[[Honestiores and humiliores|humilis]]}}), which had been created in an attempt to preserve the purity of the senatorial class. Marcian adjusted this law by declaring that the law should not exclude a woman of good character, regardless of her social status or wealth.{{sfn|Bury|2012|pp=236\u2013237}} By the time of his death, Marcian's shrewd cutting of expenditures and his avoidance of large-scale wars left the Eastern Roman treasury with a surplus of {{convert|100,000|lb}} of gold.{{sfn|Nathan|1998}} \n\nIn 451, Marcian decreed that anyone who performed [[Paganism|pagan rites]] would lose their property and be condemned to death and that no pagan temples, which had previously been closed, could be reopened. To ensure this law was implemented, he set a penalty of {{convert|50|lb|kg}} of gold for any judge, governor or official who did not enforce the law.{{sfn|Evans|2002|p=66}}\n\n===Politics===\nWhen Marcian became emperor, he was influenced by Flavius Zeno, Pulcheria, and Aspar. Flavius Zeno died soon after Marcian ascended the throne, possibly as early as the end of 451,{{sfn|Nathan|1998}}{{sfn|Lee|2013|p=97}} and Pulcheria died in July 453, leaving Aspar as the only major influence in the court of the Eastern Roman Empire.

Despite Aspar's great influence, the Eastern Roman elites retained much of their anti-German sentiment.{{sfn|Nathan|1998}} Marcian's principal advisors were Pulcheria, [[Euphemius (Magister officiorum)|Euphemius]] the {{lang|la|[[magister officiorum]]}} (master of offices), [[Palladius (praetor)|Palladius]] the praetor, and [[Anatolius of Constantinople]].{{sfn|Grant|1985|p=305}} In 453, Marcian had his daughter from a previous marriage, [[Marcia Euphemia]], marry [[Anthemius]], an aristocrat and talented general.{{sfn|Nathan|1998}}{{sfn|Dzino|Parry|2017|p=258}}\n\nMarcian patronized the Blues, who were one of the [[Deme#Later usage|two circus teams]], the other being the Greens. The two teams had become more like political parties than sports teams by his time, wielding large influence in the empire; both vied for power. After the Greens responded angrily to his patronage, Marcus censured them, forbidding any of them to hold any public office for three years. Marcian's patronage of the Blues may have had personal motivations, as the once powerful Chrysaphius had been favorable to the Greens.{{sfn|Nathan|1998}}{{sfn|Christophilopoulou|1986|p=286}}{{sfn|Bury|1923|p=85}}\n\n===Foreign relations===\nThe Armenian king [[Vardan II Mamikonian]], who was leading a revolt against the Sassanian Empire, sent an embassy to Theodosius in 450, composed of his brother [[Hmayeak Mamikonian]], along with [[Atom Gnuni]], [[Vardan Amatuni]], and [[Meruzhan Artsruni (emissary)|Meruzhan Artsruni]], to ask for assistance. Theodosius received it favorably. Any plans were cut short by his death and the accession of Marcian.{{Sfn|Manoogian|1984|p=23}}{{Sfn|Lacey|2016|p=142}} Marcian was counseled by the diplomat [[Anatolius (consul)|Anatolius]] and {{lang|la|patricius}} [[Florentius (consul 429)|Florentius]] not to make war with the Sassanians, as it would engulf a large amount of the Eastern Roman military resources, and thus Marcian did not agree to help them.{{sfn|Jones|Martindale|Morris|1980|pp=85\u201386}}{{sfn|Amirav|2015|p=55 & 93}}\n\nKing [[Gubazes I of Lazica]]\u2014a Caucasian state in theory under Eastern Roman suzerainty\u2014was attempting to form an alliance with the Sassanians to break free of Roman control in 456.{{sfn|Mikaberidze|2015|p=346}} Marcian's troops invaded Lazica and restored Roman rule.{{sfn|Elton|2018|p=174}} In 455 Marcian banned the export to barbarian tribes of weapons and the tools used to manufacture them.{{sfn|Holmes|Singleton|Jones|2001}}\n\n===Relationship with the Western Roman Empire===\nMarcian was elected without any consultation with the Western Roman Emperor, Valentinian&nbsp;III\u2013 a clear indication of further separation between the Eastern and Western Roman Empires than before his reign.{{sfn|Gallagher|2008|p=243}}{{sfn|Lee|2001|p=42}} Valentinian would later recognize Marcian as the Eastern Roman Emperor, although the date of his recognition is disputed; Lee states that Valentinian recognized Marcian in March 452,{{sfn|Lee|2001|p=43}} whereas historian [[Timothy E.

When the Vandals [[Sack of Rome (455)|sacked Rome]] in 455, after [[Petronius Maximus]] assassinated Valentinian&nbsp;III and broke an [[engagement]] treaty with the Vandals, Marcian did not respond violently, possibly due to the influence of Aspar. He merely sent an envoy demanding that the Vandals return the [[Dowager Empress]], [[Licinia Eudoxia]] and her daughters by Valentinian III, [[Placidia]] and [[Eudocia (daughter of Valentinian&nbsp;III)|Eudocia]].{{sfn|Nathan|1998}} A likely false account is given that Marcian, while captured by the Vandals in his youth, was shaded by an eagle while the other prisoners suffered the hot sun. According to this account, the Vandal King Gaiseric recognized that Marcian would later be emperor. In exchange for being released, he made Marcia pledge not to attack the Vandals should he become emperor.{{efn|name=A|Propaganda involving the story of an eagle blocking the sun, and another figure recognizing they would be emperor, was used by both Byzantine emperors [[Philippikos Bardanes]] and [[Basil&nbsp;I]].{{sfn|Lilie|2014|p=193}}}} This account originates from [[Priscus]], who served as an advisor to Marcian's confidant, Euphemius. Due to Euphemius' influence over foreign policy, some historians, such as [[Edward Arthur Thompson]], have suggested that this account was a part of official imperial propaganda, which was generated to excuse Marcian's lack of retribution towards the Vandals, and quell any discontent.{{sfn|Thompson|1950|p=68}} Marcian made several diplomatic attempts to have the prisoners returned, before finally beginning to plan an invasion of the Vandal's territory shortly before his death.{{sfn|Clover|1978|pp=193\u2013194}} The historian [[Frank Clover]] has suggested that this sudden reversal of policy was caused by the marriage of Eudocia to [[Huneric]], the son of Gaiseric, which led to such pressure from Eastern Roman elites that Marcian was forced to begin preparations for war to ensure the return of the hostages. Around this time, Marcian made peace with Lazica, which would allow him to direct his attention elsewhere. The East Roman historian [[Theodorus Lector]] speaks of Marcian's sudden reversal of policy, and [[Evagrius Scholasticus]], a Roman historian writing a century after the event, states that the Vandals released Licinia Eudoxia, Placidia, and Eudocia to Marcian after he threatened them with war, in either late 556 or early 557.{{sfn|Clover|1978|p=194}}{{sfn|Mathisen|1981|p=243}}\n\nMarcian did not recognize any Western Emperor after Valentinian, denying Petronius Maximus, now Western Emperor, when he sent an embassy requesting it, and similarly refusing to recognize [[Avitus]], who succeeded Maximus.{{sfn|Gregory|1991|p=1296}}{{sfn|Kazhdan|1991|p=704}} Marcian's exact treatment of Avitus is debated. The Roman historian [[Hydatius]] states that in 455 Avitus sent ambassadors to Marcian \"for the sake of unanimity of power,\" and that, \"Marcian and Avitus make use of Roman power in concord\". The exact usage of concord ({{lang|la|concordia}} in the original Latin) has led to debate among scholars. Some such as [[Thomas Hodgkin (historian)|Thomas Hodgkin]], [[J. B. Bury]], and [[William Bayless]] consider it grounds for the belief that Marcian may have recognized Avitus. Most scholars take a more conservative stance on it; [[Ernst Stein]] suggests that it is merely a reflection of West Roman propaganda, whereas [[Norman Baynes]] believes it indicates that Marcian was cordial to Avitus, neither hostile nor friendly.{{sfn|Mathisen|1981|p=237}}{{sfn|Baynes|1922|p=223}} Classicist [[Courtenay Edward Stevens]] interprets the phrase as meaning only that the meeting of the diplomats was amicable, rather than reflecting a relationship between the two states.{{sfn|Mathisen|1981|p=237}}\n\nThe historian [[Geoffrey Nathan]] suggests the fact that only two Western delegates attended the Council of Chalcedon points to a new level of Western Roman self-absorption in their own political and religious affairs. He mentions that the canon from this council delegating authority over the whole east to the See of Constantinople marks a religious separation. Authority over the Church in the Eastern Roman Empire would prove a point of contention between Rome and Constantinople, leading up to the [[East\u2013West Schism]].{{sfn|Nathan|1998}}\n\n==Death==\nMarcian's reign ended on 26 January 457, when he died, possibly of [[gangrene]].{{sfn|Lee|2013|p=98}}{{sfn|Meijer|2004|p=154}} [[Theodorus Lector]] and [[Theophanes the Confessor]] say that Marcian died after a long religious procession from the [[Great Palace of Constantinople|Grand Palace]] to the [[Hebdomon]], where he made the journey on foot, despite the fact that he could barely walk due to severe foot [[inflammation]], possibly [[gout]].{{sfn|Nathan|1998}}{{sfn|Meijer|2004|p=154}}{{sfn|Kelly|2013|p=240}} He was buried in the [[Church of the Holy Apostles]], in Constantinople, next to his wife Pulcheria,{{sfn|Nathan|1998}}{{sfn|Meijer|2004|p=154}} in a [[Porphyry (geology)#Imperial sarcophagi|porphyry sarcophagus]] that was described in the 10th century by [[Constantine VII|Constantine VII Porphyrogenitus]] in the {{lang|la|[[De Ceremoniis]]}}.{{sfn|Vasiliev|1948|pp=p1 & 3\u201326}} He left the Eastern Empire with seven million [[solidi]] in its treasury, an impressive achievement considering the economic ruin inflicted upon Eastern Rome by the Huns, both through warfare and the massive subsidies they received under Theodosius.{{sfn|Friell|Williams|2005|p=127}} \n\nAlthough Marcian had a son-in-law, Anthemius, he did not have any connection to the Theodosians, which Marcian himself had gained through his marriage to Pulcheria, and thus would not be considered a legitimate dynastic heir, so Aspar was once again left to play the role of emperor-maker. He selected [[Leo I the Thracian|Leo&nbsp;I]], a fifty-year-old officer commanding a unit in one of the praesental armies\u2014two field armies based near Constantinople. A later source claims that the [[Eastern Roman Senate]] offered to elect Aspar himself, but he declined, with the cryptic comment: \"I fear that a tradition in ruling might be initiated through me\". This comment has often been interpreted to be a reference to the fact that he was an [[Arian]],{{sfn|Nathan|1998}}{{sfn|Lee|2013|pp=92, 98}}{{sfn|Meijer|2004|p=154}} or else to his Alanic heritage.{{sfn|Norwich|1998|p=51}}\n\nAnthemius would later be sent by Leo to become the [[Western Roman]] [[Roman Emperor|emperor]];{{Sfn|Nathan|1998}}{{sfn|Dzino|Parry|2017|p=258}}{{sfn|Mathisen|1998}} Leo nominated him to be Western Emperor in the spring of 467, to fill the vacancy left by the death of Emperor [[Libius Severus]] since 465.

Some later scholars attribute his success not just to his skill, but also to a large degree of luck: not only had he been fortunate enough to have Pulcheria to legitimize his rule, for much of it the two greatest external threats to Rome, the Sassanian Empire and the Huns, were absorbed with their own internal problems; additionally, no natural disasters or plagues occurred during his reign.{{sfn|Nathan|1998}}{{sfn|Grant|1985|p=306}}{{sfn|Gregory|1991|p=1297}} He was remembered fondly by the people of Constantinople, who would shout \"Reign like Marcian!\" at the installation of future emperors.{{sfn|Grant|1985|p=307}}\n\nThe Prefect of Constantinople [[Tatianus]] built a [[Column of Marcian|column]] dedicated to Marcian, sometime between 450 and 452.{{sfn|Jones|Martindale|Morris|1980|pp=1053\u20131054}}{{sfn|D'Ayala |Fodde |2008|p=1167}} It still stands in Istanbul, near the north branch of the [[Mese (Constantinople)|Mese]],{{sfn|Gallagher|2008|p=204}} though the statue of Marcian that originally topped it has been lost.{{sfn|Freely|\u00c7akmak|2004|p=63}} Marcian also had a statue in the [[Forum of Arcadius]], which contained the statues of several of the successors of Emperor [[Arcadius]].{{sfn|Kazhdan|1991a|p=1347}} Marcian may have been the sponsor of the [[Chrysotriklinos]] of the Great Palace of Constantinople.

[[Fear conditioning]], which occurs when a neutral stimulus acquires aversive properties, occurs within the right hemisphere. When an individual is presented with a conditioned, aversive stimulus, it is processed within the right amygdala, producing an unpleasant or fearful response. This emotional response conditions the individual to avoid fear-inducing stimuli and more importantly, to assess threats in the environment.\n\nThe right hemisphere is also linked to [[declarative memory]], which consists of facts and information from previously experienced events and must be consciously recalled. It also plays a significant role in the retention of episodic memory. [[Episodic memory]] consists of the autobiographical aspects of memory, permitting recall of emotional and sensory experience of an event. This type of memory does not require conscious recall. The right amygdala plays a role in the association of time and places with emotional properties.<ref>Markowitsch, H.  (1998).

Amongst female subjects, the amygdala reaches its full growth potential approximately 1.5 years before the peak of male development. The structural development of the male amygdala occurs over a longer period than in women. Despite the early development of female amygdalae, they reach their growth potential sooner than males, whose amygdalae continue to develop. The larger relative size of the male amygdala may be attributed to this extended developmental period.\n\nHormonal factors may also contribute to sex-specific developmental differences. The amygdala is rich in androgen receptors \u2013 nuclear receptors that bind to testosterone. Androgen receptors play a role in the DNA binding that regulates gene expression. Though testosterone is present within the female hormonal systems, women have lower levels of testosterone than men. The abundance of testosterone in the male hormonal system may contribute to development. In addition, the grey matter volume on the amygdala is predicted by testosterone levels, which may also contribute to the increased mass of the male amygdala.\n\nThere are observable developmental differences between the right and left amygdala. The left amygdala reaches its developmental peak approximately 1.5\u20132 years prior to the right amygdala. Despite the early growth of the left amygdala, the right increases in volume for a longer period of time. The right amygdala is associated with response to fearful stimuli as well as face recognition. It is inferred that the early development of the left amygdala functions to provide infants the ability to detect danger.<ref name=\"Development\" /> In childhood, the amygdala is found to react differently to same-sex versus opposite-sex individuals.

Following any learning event, the [[long-term memory]] for the event is not formed instantaneously.

In particular, it appears that emotional arousal following the learning event influences the strength of the subsequent memory for that event. Greater emotional arousal following a learning event enhances a person's retention of that event.

In an experiment, [[common degu|degu]] pups were removed from their mother but allowed to hear her call. In response, the males produced increased [[serotonin receptor]]s in the amygdala but females lost them. This led to the males being less affected by the stressful situation.\n\nThe clusters of the amygdala are activated when an individual expresses feelings of fear or aggression. This occurs because the amygdala is the primary structure of the brain responsible for fight or flight response. Anxiety and panic attacks can occur when the amygdala senses environmental stressors that stimulate fight or flight response.\n\nThe amygdala is directly associated with conditioned fear. Conditioned fear is the framework used to explain the behavior produced when an originally neutral stimulus is consistently paired with a stimulus that evokes fear. The amygdala represents a core fear system in the human body, which is involved in the expression of conditioned fear. Fear is measured by changes in autonomic activity including increased heart rate, increased blood pressure, as well as in simple reflexes such as flinching or blinking.\n\nThe central nucleus of the amygdala has direct correlations to the hypothalamus and brainstem \u2013 areas directly related to fear and anxiety. This connection is evident from studies of  animals that have undergone amygdalae removal. Such studies suggest that animals lacking an amygdala have less fear expression and indulge in non-species-like behavior. Many projection areas of the amygdala are critically involved in specific signs that are used to measure fear and anxiety.\n\nMammals have very similar ways of processing and responding to danger. Scientists have observed similar areas in the brain \u2013 specifically in the amygdala \u2013 lighting up or becoming more active when a mammal is threatened or beginning to experience anxiety. Similar parts of the brain are activated when rodents and when humans observe a dangerous situation, the amygdala playing a crucial role in this assessment. By observing the amygdala's functions, people can determine why one rodent may be much more anxious than another. There is a direct relationship between the activation of the amygdala and the level of anxiety the subject feels.\n\nFeelings of anxiety start with a catalyst \u2013 an environmental stimulus that provokes stress. This can include various smells, sights, and internal sensations that result in anxiety. The amygdala reacts to this stimuli by preparing to either stand and fight or to turn and run. This response is triggered by the release of adrenaline into the bloodstream. Consequently, blood sugar rises, becoming immediately available to the muscles for quick energy. Shaking may occur in an attempt to return blood to the rest of the body. A better understanding of the amygdala and its various functions may lead to a new way of treating clinical anxiety.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Davis M | title = The role of the amygdala in fear and anxiety | journal = Annual Review of Neuroscience | volume = 15 | issue =  | pages = 353\u201375 | year = 1992 | pmid = 1575447 | doi = 10.1146/annurev.ne.15.030192.002033 }}</ref>\n\n===Posttraumatic stress disorder===\nThere seems to be a connection with the amygdalae and how the brain processes [[posttraumatic stress disorder]].

[[Fear conditioning]], which occurs when a neutral stimulus acquires aversive properties, occurs within the right hemisphere. When an individual is presented with a conditioned, aversive stimulus, it is processed within the right amygdala, producing an unpleasant or fearful response. This emotional response conditions the individual to avoid fear-inducing stimuli and more importantly, to assess threats in the environment.\n\nThe right hemisphere is also linked to [[declarative memory]], which consists of facts and information from previously experienced events and must be consciously recalled. It also plays a significant role in the retention of episodic memory. [[Episodic memory]] consists of the autobiographical aspects of memory, permitting recall of emotional and sensory experience of an event. This type of memory does not require conscious recall.

Amongst female subjects, the amygdala reaches its full growth potential approximately 1.5 years before the peak of male development. The structural development of the male amygdala occurs over a longer period than in women. Despite the early development of female amygdalae, they reach their growth potential sooner than males, whose amygdalae continue to develop. The larger relative size of the male amygdala may be attributed to this extended developmental period.\n\nHormonal factors may also contribute to sex-specific developmental differences. The amygdala is rich in androgen receptors \u2013 nuclear receptors that bind to testosterone. Androgen receptors play a role in the DNA binding that regulates gene expression. Though testosterone is present within the female hormonal systems, women have lower levels of testosterone than men. The abundance of testosterone in the male hormonal system may contribute to development. In addition, the grey matter volume on the amygdala is predicted by testosterone levels, which may also contribute to the increased mass of the male amygdala.\n\nThere are observable developmental differences between the right and left amygdala. The left amygdala reaches its developmental peak approximately 1.5\u20132 years prior to the right amygdala. Despite the early growth of the left amygdala, the right increases in volume for a longer period of time. The right amygdala is associated with response to fearful stimuli as well as face recognition. It is inferred that the early development of the left amygdala functions to provide infants the ability to detect danger.<ref name=\"Development\" /> In childhood, the amygdala is found to react differently to same-sex versus opposite-sex individuals.

In contrast, exploring the secondarily attractive male-derived odorants involves activation of a circuit that includes the basolateral amygdala, prefrontal cortex and ventral tegmental area.

Following any learning event, the [[long-term memory]] for the event is not formed instantaneously. Rather, information regarding the event is slowly assimilated into long-term (potentially lifelong) storage over time, possibly via [[long-term potentiation]]. Recent studies suggest that the amygdala regulates memory consolidation in other brain regions.

In particular, it appears that emotional arousal following the learning event influences the strength of the subsequent memory for that event. Greater emotional arousal following a learning event enhances a person's retention of that event. Experiments have shown that administration of stress hormones to mice immediately after they learn something enhances their retention when they are tested two days later.<ref>\"Researchers Prove A Single Memory Is Processed In Three Separate Parts Of The Brain\" {{cite web |url=https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2006/02/060202182107.htm |title=Archived copy |access-date=2018-02-28 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170912055423/https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2006/02/060202182107.htm |archive-date=12 September 2017 |df=dmy-all }}</ref>\n\nThe amygdala, especially the basolateral nuclei, are involved in mediating the effects of emotional arousal on the strength of the memory for the event, as shown by many laboratories including that of [[James McGaugh]].

In an experiment, [[common degu|degu]] pups were removed from their mother but allowed to hear her call. In response, the males produced increased [[serotonin receptor]]s in the amygdala but females lost them. This led to the males being less affected by the stressful situation.\n\nThe clusters of the amygdala are activated when an individual expresses feelings of fear or aggression. This occurs because the amygdala is the primary structure of the brain responsible for fight or flight response. Anxiety and panic attacks can occur when the amygdala senses environmental stressors that stimulate fight or flight response.\n\nThe amygdala is directly associated with conditioned fear. Conditioned fear is the framework used to explain the behavior produced when an originally neutral stimulus is consistently paired with a stimulus that evokes fear. The amygdala represents a core fear system in the human body, which is involved in the expression of conditioned fear. Fear is measured by changes in autonomic activity including increased heart rate, increased blood pressure, as well as in simple reflexes such as flinching or blinking.\n\nThe central nucleus of the amygdala has direct correlations to the hypothalamus and brainstem \u2013 areas directly related to fear and anxiety. This connection is evident from studies of  animals that have undergone amygdalae removal. Such studies suggest that animals lacking an amygdala have less fear expression and indulge in non-species-like behavior. Many projection areas of the amygdala are critically involved in specific signs that are used to measure fear and anxiety.\n\nMammals have very similar ways of processing and responding to danger. Scientists have observed similar areas in the brain \u2013 specifically in the amygdala \u2013 lighting up or becoming more active when a mammal is threatened or beginning to experience anxiety. Similar parts of the brain are activated when rodents and when humans observe a dangerous situation, the amygdala playing a crucial role in this assessment. By observing the amygdala's functions, people can determine why one rodent may be much more anxious than another. There is a direct relationship between the activation of the amygdala and the level of anxiety the subject feels.\n\nFeelings of anxiety start with a catalyst \u2013 an environmental stimulus that provokes stress. This can include various smells, sights, and internal sensations that result in anxiety. The amygdala reacts to this stimuli by preparing to either stand and fight or to turn and run. This response is triggered by the release of adrenaline into the bloodstream. Consequently, blood sugar rises, becoming immediately available to the muscles for quick energy. Shaking may occur in an attempt to return blood to the rest of the body. A better understanding of the amygdala and its various functions may lead to a new way of treating clinical anxiety.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Davis M | title = The role of the amygdala in fear and anxiety | journal = Annual Review of Neuroscience | volume = 15 | issue =  | pages = 353\u201375 | year = 1992 | pmid = 1575447 | doi = 10.1146/annurev.ne.15.030192.002033 }}</ref>\n\n===Posttraumatic stress disorder===\nThere seems to be a connection with the amygdalae and how the brain processes [[posttraumatic stress disorder]].
