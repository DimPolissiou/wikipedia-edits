Cases of infanticide in white fronted capuchins have been attributed to resource competition.]]\nInfanticide in non-human primates occurs as a result of exploitation when the individuals enacting the infanticide directly benefit from consumption or use of their victim.<ref name=\":5\" /> The individual can become a resource: food ([[Cannibalism (zoology)|cannibalism]]), protective buffer against aggression, or a prop to obtain maternal experience.\n\nThe form of exploitation in non-human primates most attributable to adult females is when non-lactating females take an infant from its mother ([[allomothering]]) and forcibly retain it until starvation. This is known as the \"aunting to death\" phenomena; these non-lactating female primates gain mothering-like experience, yet lack the resources to feed the infant.<ref name=\":5\" />\n\n=== Resource Competition ===\nResource competition results when there are too few resources in a particular area to support the existing population. In primates, resource competition is a prime motivator for infanticide. Infanticide motivated by resource competition can occur both outside of and within familial groups. Dominant, high ranking, female chimpanzees have been shown to more often aggress towards a lower ranking female and her infant due to resource competition.<ref name=\":6\">{{Cite journal|last=Pusey|first=Anne E.|last2=Schroepfer-Walker|first2=Kara|date=2013-12-05|title=Female competition in chimpanzees|journal=Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society B: Biological Sciences|volume=368|issue=1631|pages=20130077|doi=10.1098/rstb.2013.0077|issn=0962-8436|pmc=3826206|pmid=24167307}}</ref> Primates from outside of familial groups might infiltrate areas and kill infants from other groups to eliminate [[Competition (biology)|competition]] for resources. When resources are limited, infants are  easier to eliminate from the competition pool than other group members because they are the most defenseless and thus become targets of infanticide. Primate infanticide motivated by resource competition can also involve [[Cannibalism (zoology)|cannibalizing]] the infant as a source of nutrition.<ref name=\":5\">{{Cite journal|last=Hrdy|first=Sarah|year=1979|title=Infanticide among animals: A review, classification, and examination of the implications for the reproductive strategies of females|journal=Evolution & Human Behavior|volume=1|pages=13\u201340|doi=10.1016/0162-3095(79)90004-9}}</ref>\n\nResource competition is also a primary motivator in inter-species infanticide, or the killing of infants from one species by another species. Through eliminating infants of another species in the same environment, the probability that the aggressor and their own infants will obtain more resources increases. This behavior has been an observed consequence of multiple primate inter-species conflicts. In these cases, instances of direct aggression toward inter-specific infants in addition to infanticide have also been observed. In these instances of direct aggression, the aggressor was the previous target of intra-species aggression directed towards them. Therefore, the direct aggression and infanticide carried out by these aggressors could be attributed to re-directed aggression.<ref name=\":2\">{{Cite journal|last=Rimbach|first=Rebecca|last2=Pardo-Martinez|first2=Alejandra|last3=Montes-Rojas|first3=Andres|last4=Di Fiore|first4=Anthony|last5=Link|first5=Andres|date=2012-11-01|title=Interspecific Infanticide and Infant-Directed Aggression by Spider Monkeys (Ateles hybridus) in a Fragmented Forest in Colombia|journal=American Journal of Primatology|language=en|volume=74|issue=11|pages=990\u2013997|doi=10.1002/ajp.22052|issn=1098-2345|pmc=3470929|pmid=22767357}}</ref>\n\n=== Parental Manipulation ===\n\n==== Maternal Infanticide ====\nMaternal Infanticide, the killing of dependent young by the mother, is rare in non-human primates and has been reported only a handful of times.

Although commonly used in the context of food or shelter, the resource competition model can be applied to other limited resources, such as breeding opportunities or access to helpers. Most callitrichids have restrictive breeding patterns, which would be compatible with the model, but this infanticide behavior has only been documented in wild groups of common marmosets and not in wild groups of other callitrichid species. The higher frequency in common marmosets may be due to a variety of social, reproductive, and ecological characteristics - including higher likelihood for overlapping pregnancies and births (due to short intervals between births), habitat saturation, and lower costs of infant care compared to other callitrichids - that increase the chance of two breeding females inhabiting the same group, leading to more intense competition. In most observed cases in common marmosets, the socially dominant breeding females killed the infants of a subordinate female, allowing them to maintain their dominance.<ref name=\":7\" />\n\n==== Paternal Infanticide ====\nPaternal infanticide is rarely observed in non-human primates. In an extensive study of wild Japanese macaques which tracked instances of infanticide, DNA analysis revealed that males would not attack their own offspring or offspring of a female with whom they mated. Further, females in the study were found to be motivated to form social bonds with males in order to protect them from infanticide.<ref name=\":3\" />\n\n=== Social Pathology: Role of Social Organization ===\nIn mammals, interaction between the sexes is usually limited to the female [[Estrous cycle|estrous]] or copulation.

In these pairs, the males will mate with other females but live exclusively with one female as a socially monogamous pair.

This is known as the \"aunting to death\" phenomena; these non-lactating female primates gain mothering-like experience, yet lack the resources to feed the infant.<ref name=\":5\" />\n\n=== Resource Competition ===\nResource competition results when there are too few resources in a particular area to support the existing population. In primates, resource competition is a prime motivator for infanticide. Infanticide motivated by resource competition can occur both outside of and within familial groups. Dominant, high ranking, female chimpanzees have been shown to more often aggress towards a lower ranking female and her infant due to resource competition.<ref name=\":6\">{{Cite journal|last=Pusey|first=Anne E.|last2=Schroepfer-Walker|first2=Kara|date=2013-12-05|title=Female competition in chimpanzees|journal=Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society B: Biological Sciences|volume=368|issue=1631|pages=20130077|doi=10.1098/rstb.2013.0077|issn=0962-8436|pmc=3826206|pmid=24167307}}</ref> Primates from outside of familial groups might infiltrate areas and kill infants from other groups to eliminate [[Competition (biology)|competition]] for resources. When resources are limited, infants are  easier to eliminate from the competition pool than other group members because they are the most defenseless and thus become targets of infanticide. Primate infanticide motivated by resource competition can also involve [[Cannibalism (zoology)|cannibalizing]] the infant as a source of nutrition.<ref name=\":5\">{{Cite journal|last=Hrdy|first=Sarah|year=1979|title=Infanticide among animals: A review, classification, and examination of the implications for the reproductive strategies of females|journal=Evolution & Human Behavior|volume=1|pages=13\u201340|doi=10.1016/0162-3095(79)90004-9}}</ref>\n\nResource competition is also a primary motivator in inter-species infanticide, or the killing of infants from one species by another species. Through eliminating infants of another species in the same environment, the probability that the aggressor and their own infants will obtain more resources increases. This behavior has been an observed consequence of multiple primate inter-species conflicts. In these cases, instances of direct aggression toward inter-specific infants in addition to infanticide have also been observed. In these instances of direct aggression, the aggressor was the previous target of intra-species aggression directed towards them. Therefore, the direct aggression and infanticide carried out by these aggressors could be attributed to re-directed aggression.<ref name=\":2\">{{Cite journal|last=Rimbach|first=Rebecca|last2=Pardo-Martinez|first2=Alejandra|last3=Montes-Rojas|first3=Andres|last4=Di Fiore|first4=Anthony|last5=Link|first5=Andres|date=2012-11-01|title=Interspecific Infanticide and Infant-Directed Aggression by Spider Monkeys (Ateles hybridus) in a Fragmented Forest in Colombia|journal=American Journal of Primatology|language=en|volume=74|issue=11|pages=990\u2013997|doi=10.1002/ajp.22052|issn=1098-2345|pmc=3470929|pmid=22767357}}</ref>\n\n=== Parental Manipulation ===\n\n==== Maternal Infanticide ====\nMaternal Infanticide, the killing of dependent young by the mother, is rare in non-human primates and has been reported only a handful of times.

Although commonly used in the context of food or shelter, the resource competition model can be applied to other limited resources, such as breeding opportunities or access to helpers. Most callitrichids have restrictive breeding patterns, which would be compatible with the model, but this infanticide behavior has only been documented in wild groups of common marmosets and not in wild groups of other callitrichid species. The higher frequency in common marmosets may be due to a variety of social, reproductive, and ecological characteristics - including higher likelihood for overlapping pregnancies and births (due to short intervals between births), habitat saturation, and lower costs of infant care compared to other callitrichids - that increase the chance of two breeding females inhabiting the same group, leading to more intense competition. In most observed cases in common marmosets, the socially dominant breeding females killed the infants of a subordinate female, allowing them to maintain their dominance.<ref name=\":7\" />\n\n==== Paternal Infanticide ====\nPaternal infanticide is rarely observed in non-human primates. In an extensive study of wild Japanese macaques which tracked instances of infanticide, DNA analysis revealed that males would not attack their own offspring or offspring of a female with whom they mated. Further, females in the study were found to be motivated to form social bonds with males in order to protect them from infanticide.<ref name=\":3\" />\n\n=== Social Pathology: Role of Social Organization ===\nIn mammals, interaction between the sexes is usually limited to the female [[Estrous cycle|estrous]] or copulation.

Its functionality is dependent upon post-translational modifications.  Phosphorylation of KAP1 acts as a deactivator of the protein in many of its mechanisms while sumoylation acts as an activator.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">{{cite journal|last1=Iyengar|first1=Sushma|last2=Farnham|first2=Peggy|title=KAP1 Protein: An Enigmatic Master Regulator of the Genome|journal=The Journal of Biological Chemistry|date=2011-07-29|volume=286|doi=10.1074/jbc.r111.252569 |pmc=3143589|pmid=21652716|pages=26267\u201326276}}</ref>\n\n=== Cellular differentiation and proliferation ===\n\nStudies have shown that deletion of KAP1 in mice before gastrulation results in death (implicating it as a necessary protein for proliferation) while deletion in adult mice results in increased anxiety and stress-induced alterations in learning and memory.  KAP1 has been shown to participate in the maintenance of pluripotency of embryonic stem cells and to promote and inhibit cellular differentiation of adult cell lines.  Increased levels of KAP1 have been found in liver, gastric, breast, lung, and prostate cancers as well, indicating that it may play an important role in tumor cell proliferation (possibly by inhibiting apoptosis).<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/>\n\n=== Transcriptional regulation ===\n\nKAP1 can regulate genomic transcription through a variety of mechanisms, many of which remain somewhat unclear.  Studies have shown that KAP1 can repress transcription by binding directly to the genome (which can be sufficient in and of itself) or through the induction of heterochromatin formation via the Mi2\u03b1-SETB1-HP1 macromolecular complex.<ref name=\"elifesciences.org\"/><ref>{{cite journal|last1=Sripathy|first1=Smith|title=The KAP1 Corepressor Functions To Coordinate the Assembly of De Novo HP1-Demarcated Microenvironments of Heterochromatin Required for KRAB Zinc Finger Protein-Mediated Transcriptional Repression|journal=Molecular and Cellular Biology|date=2006-03-20|doi=|url=http://mcb.asm.org/content/26/22/8623.full.pdf}}</ref>  KAP1 can also interact with histone methyltransferases and deacetylases via the C-terminal PHD and Bromodomain to control transcription epigenetically.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/>\n\n=== DNA damage repair response ===\n\nIt has been shown that ATM phosphorylates KAP1 upon the discovery of damaged or broken DNA.  Phosphorylated KAP1, along with many other DNA damage proteins, rapidly migrate to the site of the DNA damage.  Its exact involvement in this pathway is somewhat unclear, but it has been implicated in triggering cell arrest, allowing for the damaged DNA to be repaired.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/>\n\n=== Apoptosis ===\n\nKAP1 forms a complex with MDM2 (a ubiquitin E3 ligase) that binds to p53.  The complex marks the bound p53 for degradation.  p53 is a known precursor of apoptosis that facilitates the synthesis of proteins necessary for cell death so its degradation results in apoptosis inhibition.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/>\n\n== Clinical significance ==\n\n=== Role in the establishment of viral latency ===\n\nKAP1 facilitates the establishment of viral latency in certain cell types for Human Cytomegalovirus (HCMV) and other endogenous retroviruses<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/><ref name=\"elifesciences.org\">{{cite journal|last1=Rauwel|first1=Benjamin|title=Release of human cytomegalovirus from latency by a KAP1/TRIM28 phosphorylation switch|journal=eLife|date=2015-04-07|doi=10.7554/eLife.06068|url=http://elifesciences.org/content/4/e06068|pmc=4384640|pmid=25846574|volume=4}}</ref>\n.  KAP1 acts as a transcriptional corepressor of the viral genome.  The protein binds to the histones of the viral chromatin and then recruits Mi2\u03b1 and SETB1.  SETB1 is a histone methyltransferase that recruits HP1, thus inducing heterochromatin formation.  This heterochromatin formation prevents the transcription of the viral genome.  mTOR has been implicated in the phosphorylation of KAP1 resulting in a switch from latency to the lytic cycle.<ref name=\"elifesciences.org\"/>\n\n=== Manipulations and potential for future treatment ===\n\n[[ATM serine/threonine kinase|Ataxia telangiectasia mutated]] (ATM) is a kinase that (similar to mTOR) can phosphorylate KAP1 resulting in the switch from viral latency to the lytic cycle.  Chloroquine (an ATM) activator has been shown to result in increases in transcription of the HCMV genome.  This effect is augmented by the use of tumor necrosis factor    It has been proposed that this treatment (accompanied by antiretroviral treatment) has the potential to purge the virus from infected

Its functionality is dependent upon post-translational modifications.  Phosphorylation of KAP1 acts as a deactivator of the protein in many of its mechanisms while sumoylation acts as an activator.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">{{cite journal|last1=Iyengar|first1=Sushma|last2=Farnham|first2=Peggy|title=KAP1 Protein: An Enigmatic Master Regulator of the Genome|journal=The Journal of Biological Chemistry|date=2011-07-29|volume=286|doi=10.1074/jbc.r111.252569 |pmc=3143589|pmid=21652716|pages=26267\u201326276}}</ref>\n\n=== Cellular differentiation and proliferation ===\n\nStudies have shown that deletion of KAP1 in mice before gastrulation results in death (implicating it as a necessary protein for proliferation) while deletion in adult mice results in increased anxiety and stress-induced alterations in learning and memory.  KAP1 has been shown to participate in the maintenance of pluripotency of embryonic stem cells and to promote and inhibit cellular differentiation of adult cell lines.  Increased levels of KAP1 have been found in liver, gastric, breast, lung, and prostate cancers as well, indicating that it may play an important role in tumor cell proliferation (possibly by inhibiting apoptosis).<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/>\n\n=== Transcriptional regulation ===\n\nKAP1 can regulate genomic transcription through a variety of mechanisms, many of which remain somewhat unclear.  Studies have shown that KAP1 can repress transcription by binding directly to the genome (which can be sufficient in and of itself) or through the induction of heterochromatin formation via the Mi2\u03b1-SETB1-HP1 macromolecular complex.<ref name=\"elifesciences.org\"/><ref>{{cite journal|last1=Sripathy|first1=Smith|title=The KAP1 Corepressor Functions To Coordinate the Assembly of De Novo HP1-Demarcated Microenvironments of Heterochromatin Required for KRAB Zinc Finger Protein-Mediated Transcriptional Repression|journal=Molecular and Cellular Biology|date=2006-03-20|doi=|url=http://mcb.asm.org/content/26/22/8623.full.pdf}}</ref>  KAP1 can also interact with histone methyltransferases and deacetylases via the C-terminal PHD and Bromodomain to control transcription epigenetically.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/>\n\n=== DNA damage repair response ===\n\nIt has been shown that ATM phosphorylates KAP1 upon the discovery of damaged or broken DNA.  Phosphorylated KAP1, along with many other DNA damage proteins, rapidly migrate to the site of the DNA damage.  Its exact involvement in this pathway is somewhat unclear, but it has been implicated in triggering cell arrest, allowing for the damaged DNA to be repaired.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/>\n\n=== Apoptosis ===\n\nKAP1 forms a complex with MDM2 (a ubiquitin E3 ligase) that binds to p53.  The complex marks the bound p53 for degradation.  p53 is a known precursor of apoptosis that facilitates the synthesis of proteins necessary for cell death so its degradation results in apoptosis inhibition.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/>\n\n== Clinical significance ==\n\n=== Role in the establishment of viral latency ===\n\nKAP1 facilitates the establishment of viral latency in certain cell types for Human Cytomegalovirus (HCMV) and other endogenous retroviruses<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/><ref name=\"elifesciences.org\">{{cite journal|last1=Rauwel|first1=Benjamin|title=Release of human cytomegalovirus from latency by a KAP1/TRIM28 phosphorylation switch|journal=eLife|date=2015-04-07|doi=10.7554/eLife.06068|url=http://elifesciences.org/content/4/e06068|pmc=4384640|pmid=25846574|volume=4}}</ref>\n.  KAP1 acts as a transcriptional corepressor of the viral genome.  The protein binds to the histones of the viral chromatin and then recruits Mi2\u03b1 and SETB1.  SETB1 is a histone methyltransferase that recruits HP1, thus inducing heterochromatin formation.  This heterochromatin formation prevents the transcription of the viral genome.  mTOR has been implicated in the phosphorylation of KAP1 resulting in a switch from latency to the lytic cycle.<ref name=\"elifesciences.org\"/>\n\n=== Manipulations and potential for future treatment ===\n\nAtaxia telangiectasia mutated (ATM) is a kinase that (similar to mTOR) can phosphorylate KAP1 resulting in the switch from viral latency to the lytic cycle.  Chloroquine (an ATM) activator has been shown to result in increases in transcription of the HCMV genome.  This effect is augmented by the use of tumor necrosis factor    It has been proposed that this treatment (accompanied by antiretroviral treatment) has the potential to purge the virus from infected individuals.<ref name=\"elifesciences.org\"/>\n\n== Interactions ==\n\nTRIM28 has been shown to [[Protein-protein interaction|interact]] with:\n{{div col|colwidth=20em}}\n* [[CBX5 (gene)|CBX5]],<ref

{"title_page": "Dating", "text_new": "{{Close Relationships}}\n\n'''Dating''' is a stage of romantic relationships in humans whereby two people meet socially with the aim of each assessing the other's suitability as a prospective partner in an [[intimate relationship]]. It is a form of [[courtship]], consisting of [[socializing|social activities]] done by the couple, either alone or with others. The protocols and practices of dating, and the terms used to describe it, vary considerably from country to country and over time. While the term has several meanings, the most frequent usage refers to two people exploring whether they are romantically or sexually compatible by participating in dates with the other. With the use of modern technology, people can date via telephone or computer or just meet in person.\n\nDating may also involve two or more people who have already decided that they share romantic or sexual feelings toward each other. These people will have dates on a regular basis, and they may or may not be having [[Human sexual activity|sexual relations]]. This period of courtship is sometimes seen as a precursor to [[engagement]].<ref name=twsDecI28>{{cite news|title= 'Lao wai' speak out on false image in China |newspaper= China Daily |date= 2004-02-06 |url= http://www.chinadaily.com.cn/english/doc/2004-02/06/content_303955.htm |accessdate= 2010-12-09}}</ref><ref name=twsDecI34ee /> Some cultures{{which|date=December 2018}} require people to wait until a certain age to begin dating,<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.healthline.com/health/parenting/appropriate-dating-age|title=What Age Is Appropriate for Dating: A Guide for Parents|website=Healthline|language=en|access-date=2019-12-30}}</ref> which has been a source of controversy.\n\n{{TOC limit}}\n\n== History ==\n[[File:Gerrit van Honthorst - De koppelaarster.jpg|alt=|thumb|277x277px|''[[The Matchmaker (painting)|The Matchmaker]];'' a 1625 oil painting depicting a man and a woman in a romantic encounter.]]\nDating as an institution is a relatively recent phenomenon which has mainly emerged in the last few centuries. From the standpoint of [[anthropology]] and [[sociology]], dating is linked with other institutions such as marriage and the [[family]] which have also been changing rapidly and which have been subject to many forces, including advances in technology and medicine. As humans societies have evolved from [[hunter-gatherer]]s into [[Civilization|civilized societies]], there have been substantial changes in relations between people, with perhaps one of a few remaining [[biology|biological]] constants being that both adult [[Woman|women]] and [[Man|men]] must have [[sexual intercourse]] for human procreation to happen.\n\nHumans have been compared to other species in terms of sexual behavior. [[Neurobiology|Neurobiologist]] [[Robert Sapolsky]] constructed a reproductive spectrum with opposite poles being [[Display (zoology)|tournament species]], in which males compete fiercely for reproductive privileges with females, and [[pair bond]] arrangements, in which a male and female will bond for life.<ref name=twsDecM11fss>{{cite news\n |author= Robert Sapolsky\n |title= Biology and Human Behavior: The Neurological Origins of Individuality, 2nd edition\n |publisher= The Teaching Company\n |quote= (lectures on CD-audio)\n |year= 2005\n |url=https://www.amazon.co.uk/Biology-Human-Behavior-Neurological-Individuality/dp/B00DTUY66C\n |accessdate= 2010-12-07\n}}</ref> According to Sapolsky, humans are somewhat in the middle of this spectrum, in the sense that humans form pair bonds, but there is the possibility of cheating or changing partners.<ref name=twsDecM11fss /> These species-particular behavior patterns provide a context for aspects of [[human reproduction]], including dating. However, one particularity of the human species is that pair bonds are often formed without necessarily having the intention of reproduction. In modern times, emphasis on the institution of marriage, generally described as a male-female bond, has obscured pair bonds formed by same-sex and transgender couples, and that many heterosexual couples also bond for life without offspring, or that often pairs that do have offspring separate. Thus, the concept of marriage is changing widely in many countries.\n\nHistorically, marriages in most societies were [[Arranged marriage|arranged by parents]] and older relatives with the goal not being [[love]] but legacy and \"economic stability and political alliances\", according to [[anthropology|anthropologists]].<ref name=twsDecM11>{{cite journal\n |author1=Kris Paap |author2=Douglas Raybeck |title= A Differently Gendered Landscape: Gender and Agency in the Web-based Personals\n |publisher= Electronic Journal of Sociology\n |quote= most marriages in the world are arranged...\n |year= 2005\n |citeseerx=10.1.1.107.993\n}}</ref> Accordingly, there was little need for a temporary trial period such as dating before a permanent community-recognized union was formed between a man and a woman. While pair-bonds of varying forms were recognized by most societies as acceptable social arrangements, marriage was reserved for heterosexual pairings and had a transactional nature, where wives were in many cases a form of property being exchanged between father and husband, and who would have to serve the function of reproduction. Communities exerted pressure on people to form pair-bonds in places such as [[Europe]]; in [[China]], society \"demanded people get married before having a sexual relationship\"<ref name=twsDecI22bb>{{cite news\n |title= Parents explore dating scene for choosy children\n |newspaper= China Daily\n |quote= ... in earlier times society demanded people get married before having a sexual relationship.\n |date= 2005-11-11\n |url= http://www.chinadaily.com.cn/english/doc/2005-11/11/content_493925.htm\n |accessdate= 2010-12-09\n}}</ref> and many societies found that some formally recognized bond between a man and a woman was the best way of rearing and educating [[child]]ren as well as helping to avoid conflicts and misunderstandings regarding competition for mates.\n\n[[File:DickseeRomeoandJuliet.jpg|thumb|right|upright|The clandestine meeting between Romeo and Juliet in [[Romeo and Juliet|Shakespeare's play]]. Painting by [[Frank Dicksee|Sir Frank Dicksee]], 1884]]\nGenerally, during much of recorded history of humans in civilization, and into the [[Middle Ages]] in [[Europe]], weddings were seen as [[business]] arrangements between families, while romance was something that happened outside of marriage discreetly, such as covert meetings.<ref name=twsDecH34a /> The 12th-century book ''[[De amore (Andreas Capellanus)|The Art of Courtly Love]]'' advised that \"True love can have no place between husband and wife.\"<ref name=twsDecH34a>{{cite news\n |title= Raw dater\n |newspaper= The Guardian\n |quote= ...\"True love can have no place between husband and wife,\" ...\n |date= 24 January 2009\n |url= https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2009/jan/24/dating-statistics\n |accessdate= 2010-12-08\n}}</ref> According to one view, clandestine meetings between men and women, generally outside of marriage or before marriage, were the precursors to today's dating.<ref name=twsDecH34a />\n\nFrom about 1700 a worldwide movement perhaps described as the \"empowerment of the individual\" took hold, leading towards greater emancipation of women and equality of individuals. Men and women became more equal politically, financially, and socially in many nations. Women eventually won the right to vote in many countries and own property and receive [[Equality before the law|equal treatment by the law]], and these changes had profound impacts on the relationships between men and women. Parental influence declined. In many societies, individuals could decide\u2014on their own\u2014whether they should marry, whom they should marry, and when they should marry. A few centuries ago, dating was sometimes described as a \"courtship ritual where young women entertained gentleman callers, usually in the home, under the watchful eye of a [[Chaperone (social)|chaperone]],\"<ref>{{cite news\n |author= Brenda Wilson\n |title= Sex Without Intimacy: No Dating, No Relationships\n |work= National Public Radio\n |quote= Dating itself ... evolved out of a courtship ritual where young women entertained gentleman callers, usually in the home, ...\n |date= June 8, 2009\n |url= https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=105008712\n |accessdate= 2010-12-08\n}}</ref> but increasingly, in many Western countries, it became a self-initiated activity with two young people going out as a couple in public together. Still, dating varies considerably by nation, custom, religious upbringing, technology, and social class, and important exceptions with regards to individual freedoms remain as many countries today still practice arranged marriages, request dowries, and forbid same-sex pairings. Although in many countries, movies, meals, and meeting in coffeehouses and other places is now popular, as are advice books suggesting various strategies for men and women,<ref name=twsDecH26c>{{cite news\n |author= Maureen Dowd quoting poet Dorothy Parker\n |title= What's a Modern Girl to Do?\n |newspaper= The New York Times\n |quote= ...What our grandmothers told us about playing hard to get is true. ...\n |year= 2005\n |url= https://www.nytimes.com/2005/10/30/magazine/30feminism.html\n |accessdate= 2010-12-08\n}}</ref> in other parts of the world, such as in South Asia and many parts of the Middle East, being alone in public as a couple is not only frowned upon but can even lead to either person being socially ostracized.\n\nIn the twentieth century, dating was sometimes seen as a precursor to marriage but it could also be considered as an end-in-itself, that is, an informal social activity akin to [[friendship]].

[[effects of the automobile on societies|Cars]] extended the range of dating as well as enabled back-seat sexual exploration. In the mid-twentieth century, the advent of [[birth control]] as well as safer procedures for [[abortion]] changed the equation considerably, and there was less pressure to marry as a means for satisfying sexual urges. New types of relationships formed; it was possible for people to live together without marrying and without [[children]]. Information about [[human sexuality]] grew, and with it an acceptance of all types of sexual orientations is becoming more common. Today, the institution of dating continues to evolve at a rapid rate with new possibilities and choices opening up particularly through [[online dating]].\n\n=== Etymology ===\nThe word \"dating\" entered the American language during the [[Roaring Twenties]]. Prior to that, courtship was a matter of family and community interest. Starting around the time of the [[American Civil War|Civil War]], courtship became a private matter for couples.<ref>{{cite web|last=Hirsch|first=Elaine|title=The History of Dating and Communication|url=http://www.communicationstudies.com/the-history-of-dating-and-communication|accessdate=6 May 2012}}</ref>\n\n== As a social relationship ==\n\n=== Wide variation in behavior patterns ===\n[[File:Mary Poppins8.jpg|thumb|right|[[Julie Andrews]] as [[Mary Poppins (character)|Mary Poppins]].]]\n{{quote|text=And the only rule is that there are no rules.|sign=[[Kira Cochrane]]<ref name=twsDecH27a134kcc />}}\nSocial rules regarding dating vary considerably according to variables such as country, social class, race, religion, age, sexual orientation and gender. Behavior patterns are generally unwritten and constantly changing. There are considerable differences between social and personal [[Value (personal and cultural)|values]]. Each culture has particular patterns which determine such choices as whether the man asks the woman out, where people might meet, whether kissing is acceptable on a first date, the substance of conversation, who should pay for meals or entertainment,<ref name=\"twsDecH26j\">{{cite news\n |author= Maureen Dowd quoting poet Dorothy Parker\n |title= What's a Modern Girl to Do?\n |newspaper= The New York Times\n |year= 2005\n |url= https://www.nytimes.com/2005/10/30/magazine/30feminism.html\n |accessdate= 2010-12-08\n}}</ref><ref name=whopaysondate>{{cite news\n |author       = Bonny Albo\n |title        = Who pays on a date?\n |publisher    = Dating on About.com\n |url          = http://dating.about.com/od/trickydatingquestions/f/whopays.htm\n |accessdate   = 2011-02-20\n |archive-url  = https://web.archive.org/web/20110105221232/http://dating.about.com/od/trickydatingquestions/f/whopays.htm\n |archive-date = 2011-01-05\n |url-status     = dead\n}}</ref> or whether splitting expenses is allowed.

For example, director [[Blake Edwards]] wanted to date singing star [[Julie Andrews]], and he joked in parties about her persona by saying that her \"endlessly cheerful governess\" image from movies such as ''[[Mary Poppins (film)|Mary Poppins]]'' and ''[[The Sound of Music (film)|The Sound of Music]]'' gave her the image of possibly having \"lilacs for pubic hair\";<ref name=twsDecQ>{{cite news\n |title= Blake Edwards, Prolific Comedy Director, Dies at 88\n |newspaper= The New York Times\n |quote= ... \u201cShe has lilacs for pubic hair.\u201d ...\n |date= December 16, 2010\n |url= https://www.nytimes.com/2010/12/17/movies/17edwards.html\n |accessdate= 2010-12-17\n}}</ref> Andrews appreciated his humor, sent him lilacs, dated him and later married him, and the couple stayed together for 41 years until his death in 2010.<ref name=twsDecQ />\n\n=== Different meanings of the term ===\nWhile the term ''dating'' has many meanings, the most common refers to a trial period in which two people explore whether to take the relationship further towards a more permanent relationship; in this sense, dating refers to the time when people are physically together in public as opposed to the earlier time period in which people are arranging the date, perhaps by corresponding by email or text or phone.<ref name=twsDecH27der5 /> Another meaning of the term ''dating'' is to describe a stage in a person's life when he or she is actively pursuing romantic relationships with different people. If two unmarried celebrities are seen in public together, they are often described as \"dating\" which means they were seen in public together, and it is not clear whether they are merely friends, exploring a more intimate relationship, or are romantically involved. A related sense of the term is when two people have been out in public only a few times but have not yet committed to a relationship; in this sense, ''dating'' describes as two individuals actively involved in meeting one another and looking forward for a relationship.<ref>https://www.bloominggirl.in/2020/04/online-dating.html</ref>\n\n=== Evaluation ===\nOne of the main purposes of dating is for two or more people to evaluate one another's suitability as a long term companion or spouse.{{citation needed|date=December 2019}} Often physical characteristics, personality, financial status, and other aspects of the involved persons are judged and, as a result, feelings can be hurt and confidence shaken. Because of the uncertainty of the whole situation, the desire to be acceptable to the other person, and the possibility of rejection, dating can be very stressful for all parties involved. Some studies have shown that dating tends to be extremely difficult for people with [[social anxiety disorder]].<ref>Stevens, Sarah B., and Tracy L.

In addition to the detrimental effects of upholding limited views of relationships and sexual and romantic desires, stereotypes also lead to framing social problems in a problematic way. For example, some have noted that educated women in many countries including [[Italy]] and [[Russia]], and the [[United States]] find it difficult to have a [[career]] as well as raise a family, prompting a number of writers to suggest how women should approach dating and how to time their careers and personal life. The advice comes with the assumption that the work-life balance is inherently a \"woman's problem.\" In many societies, there is a view that women should fulfill the role of primary caregivers, with little to no spousal support and with few services by employers or government such as parental leave or child care. Accordingly, an issue regarding dating is the subject of career timing which generates controversy. Some views reflect a traditional notion of gender roles. For example, [[Danielle Crittenden]] in ''What Our Mothers Didn't Tell Us'' argued that having both a career and family at the same time was taxing and stressful for a woman; as a result, she suggested that women should date in their early twenties with a seriousness of purpose, marry when their relative beauty permitted them to find a reliable partner, have children, then return to work in their early thirties with kids in school; Crittenden acknowledged that splitting a career path with a ten-year baby-raising hiatus posed difficulties.<ref name=twsDecxfpu89>{{cite news\n |author= David Gergen engages Danielle Crittenden\n |title= interview about: What Our Mothers Didn't Tell Us: Why Happiness Eludes the Modern Woman (excerpts)\n |publisher= [[PBS]]\n |date= March 1, 1999\n |url= https://www.pbs.org/newshour/gergen/march99/gergen_3-1.html\n |accessdate= 2011-02-04\n}}</ref> There are contrasting views which suggest that women should focus on careers in their twenties and thirties.

Illegitimate relationships before marriage are considered a social taboo and social interaction between unmarried men and women is encouraged at a modest and healthy level. Couples are usually wedded through either an [[arranged marriage]] or [[love marriage]]. Love marriages are those in which the individuals have chosen a partner whom they like by their own choice prior to marriage, and usually occur with the consent of parents and family. Arranged marriages on the other hand are marriages which are set and agreed by the families or guardians of the two individuals where the couple may not have met before. In either cases and in consistency with traditional marital practices, individuals who marry are persuaded to meet and talk to each other for some time before considering marrying so that they can check their compatibility.\n\n==== Singapore ====\n[[Singapore]]'s largest dating service, SDU, [[Social Development Unit]], is a government-run dating system.

Bretten], Enke, Stuttgart 1970, {{ISBN|3-432-01618-2}}, Benita Luckmann</ref>\n\nMembership in [[voluntary association]]s is relatively high in German-speaking countries and these provided further chances for possible partners to meet. Strolling on [[Esplanade]]s and Promenade walkways such as the one in Hamburg called the [[Jungfernstieg]] (maidens way), have been another venue for introductions as early as the 19th century. Analyst [[Geoffrey Gorer]] described dating as an American [[idiosyncrasy]] focusing on youth of college age and expressed in activities such as American [[prom]]s. In contrast German speaking countries and the longstanding musical tradition there provided ample opportunity of persons of varying ages enjoying social dances, such as the [[Vienna Opera Ball]] and other occasions.\n\nRomantic encounters were often described with [[French language|French]] terms like [[wikt:rendezvous|rendezvous]] or [[wikt:t\u00eate-\u00e0-t\u00eate|t\u00eate-\u00e0-t\u00eate]]. The [[German language|German]] term of ''Stelldichein'' (as translated by [[Joachim Heinrich Campe]]s) is used to signify dating when the age of consent to marriage was relatively high. German traditions to signify lovers who met in hiding were described with terms like ''Fensterln'' (windowing) or ''Kiltgang'' (dawn stroll) used in [[Bavaria]] and [[Switzerland]].<ref Name=mart>[http://www.zeit.de/2009/28/Martenstein-28 \"No talk, no deal\" Unser Kolumnist versteht endlich die amerikanischen Regeln der Partnerwahl] (Our Commentator finally understands the American Rucles of choosing a partner) [[Harald Martenstein]], [[Die Zeit]]  29 June 2009</ref> Analyst Sebastian Heinzel sees a major cultural divide between American dating habits and European informality, and leads to instances in which European expatriates in cities such as [[New York, New York|New York]] keep to themselves.<ref>[http://www.tagesspiegel.de/zeitung/das-war-so-nicht-verabredet/v_default,1061296.html Das war so nicht verabredet!

An example is meeting perhaps twenty potential partners in a bar with brief interviews between each possible couple, perhaps lasting three minutes in length, and shuffling partners. In [[Shanghai, China|Shanghai]], one event featured eight-minute one-on-one meetings in which participants were pre-screened by age and education and career, and which costs 50 yuan ($6 USD) per participant; participants are asked not to reveal contact information during the brief meeting with the other person, but rather place names in cards for organizers to arrange subsequent dates.<ref name=twsDecI24>{{cite news\n |author= Jin Haili\n |title= The fast way to fall in love\n |newspaper= China Daily\n |date= 2004-09-16\n |url= http://www.chinadaily.com.cn/english/doc/2004-09/16/content_375019.htm\n |accessdate= 2010-12-09\n}}</ref> Advantages of speed dating: efficiency; \"avoids an embarrassing disaster date\"; cost-effective; way to make friends.<ref name=twsDecI24 /> Disadvantages: it can turn into a beauty contest with only a few good-looking participants getting most offers, while less attractive peers received few or no offers; critics suggest that the format prevents factors such as personality and [[intelligence]] from emerging, particularly in large groups with extra-brief meeting times.<ref name=twsDecI25>{{cite news\n |title= Speed dating all about looks and not personality\n |newspaper= China Daily\n |quote= ...

Some services would record and play back videos for men and women on alternate days to minimize the chance that customers would meet each other on the street.\n* '''Phone dating''' systems of about the same vintage, where customers call a common voice mail or phone-chat server at a common local phone number, and are connected with other (reputed) singles, and typically charged by the minute as if it were a long-distance call (often a very expensive one).

As humans societies have evolved from [[hunter-gatherer]]s into [[Civilization|civilized societies]], there have been substantial changes in relations between people, with perhaps one of a few remaining [[biology|biological]] constants being that both adult [[Woman|women]] and [[Man|men]] must have [[sexual intercourse]] for human procreation to happen.\n\nHumans have been compared to other species in terms of sexual behavior. [[Neurobiology|Neurobiologist]] [[Robert Sapolsky]] constructed a reproductive spectrum with opposite poles being [[Display (zoology)|tournament species]], in which males compete fiercely for reproductive privileges with females, and [[pair bond]] arrangements, in which a male and female will bond for life.<ref name=twsDecM11fss>{{cite news\n |author= Robert Sapolsky\n |title= Biology and Human Behavior: The Neurological Origins of Individuality, 2nd edition\n |publisher= The Teaching Company\n |quote= (lectures on CD-audio)\n |year= 2005\n |url=https://www.amazon.co.uk/Biology-Human-Behavior-Neurological-Individuality/dp/B00DTUY66C\n |accessdate= 2010-12-07\n}}</ref> According to Sapolsky, humans are somewhat in the middle of this spectrum, in the sense that humans form pair bonds, but there is the possibility of cheating or changing partners.<ref name=twsDecM11fss /> These species-particular behavior patterns provide a context for aspects of [[human reproduction]], including dating. However, one particularity of the human species is that pair bonds are often formed without necessarily having the intention of reproduction. In modern times, emphasis on the institution of marriage, generally described as a male-female bond, has obscured pair bonds formed by same-sex and transgender couples, and that many heterosexual couples also bond for life without offspring, or that often pairs that do have offspring separate. Thus, the concept of marriage is changing widely in many countries.\n\nHistorically, marriages in most societies were [[Arranged marriage|arranged by parents]] and older relatives with the goal not being [[love]] but legacy and \"economic stability and political alliances\", according to [[anthropology|anthropologists]].<ref name=twsDecM11>{{cite journal\n |author1=Kris Paap |author2=Douglas Raybeck |title= A Differently Gendered Landscape: Gender and Agency in the Web-based Personals\n |publisher= Electronic Journal of Sociology\n |quote= most marriages in the world are arranged...\n |year= 2005\n |citeseerx=10.1.1.107.993\n}}</ref> Accordingly, there was little need for a temporary trial period such as dating before a permanent community-recognized union was formed between a man and a woman. While pair-bonds of varying forms were recognized by most societies as acceptable social arrangements, marriage was reserved for heterosexual pairings and had a transactional nature, where wives were in many cases a form of property being exchanged between father and husband, and who would have to serve the function of reproduction. Communities exerted pressure on people to form pair-bonds in places such as [[Europe]]; in [[China]], society \"demanded people get married before having a sexual relationship\"<ref name=twsDecI22bb>{{cite news\n |title= Parents explore dating scene for choosy children\n |newspaper= China Daily\n |quote= ... in earlier times society demanded people get married before having a sexual relationship.\n |date= 2005-11-11\n |url= http://www.chinadaily.com.cn/english/doc/2005-11/11/content_493925.htm\n |accessdate= 2010-12-09\n}}</ref> and many societies found that some formally recognized bond between a man and a woman was the best way of rearing and educating [[child]]ren as well as helping to avoid conflicts and misunderstandings regarding competition for mates.\n\n[[File:DickseeRomeoandJuliet.jpg|thumb|right|upright|The clandestine meeting between Romeo and Juliet in [[Romeo and Juliet|Shakespeare's play]]. Painting by [[Frank Dicksee|Sir Frank Dicksee]], 1884]]\nGenerally, during much of recorded history of humans in civilization, and into the [[Middle Ages]] in [[Europe]], weddings were seen as [[business]] arrangements between families, while romance was something that happened outside of marriage discreetly, such as covert meetings.<ref name=twsDecH34a /> The 12th-century book ''[[De amore (Andreas Capellanus)|The Art of Courtly Love]]'' advised that \"True love can have no place between husband and wife.\"<ref name=twsDecH34a>{{cite news\n |title= Raw dater\n |newspaper= The Guardian\n |quote= ...\"True love can have no place between husband and wife,\" ...\n |date= 24 January 2009\n |url= https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2009/jan/24/dating-statistics\n |accessdate= 2010-12-08\n}}</ref> According to one view, clandestine meetings between men and women, generally outside of marriage or before marriage, were the precursors to today's dating.<ref name=twsDecH34a />\n\nFrom about 1700 a worldwide movement perhaps described as the \"empowerment of the individual\" took hold, leading towards greater emancipation of women and equality of individuals. Men and women became more equal politically, financially, and socially in many nations. Women eventually won the right to vote in many countries and own property and receive [[Equality before the law|equal treatment by the law]], and these changes had profound impacts on the relationships between men and women. Parental influence declined. In many societies, individuals could decide\u2014on their own\u2014whether they should marry, whom they should marry, and when they should marry. A few centuries ago, dating was sometimes described as a \"courtship ritual where young women entertained gentleman callers, usually in the home, under the watchful eye of a [[Chaperone (social)|chaperone]],\"<ref>{{cite news\n |author= Brenda Wilson\n |title= Sex Without Intimacy: No Dating, No Relationships\n |work= National Public Radio\n |quote= Dating itself ... evolved out of a courtship ritual where young women entertained gentleman callers, usually in the home, ...\n |date= June 8, 2009\n |url= https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=105008712\n |accessdate= 2010-12-08\n}}</ref> but increasingly, in many Western countries, it became a self-initiated activity with two young people going out as a couple in public together. Still, dating varies considerably by nation, custom, religious upbringing, technology, and social class, and important exceptions with regards to individual freedoms remain as many countries today still practice arranged marriages, request dowries, and forbid same-sex pairings. Although in many countries, movies, meals, and meeting in coffeehouses and other places is now popular, as are advice books suggesting various strategies for men and women,<ref name=twsDecH26c>{{cite news\n |author= Maureen Dowd quoting poet Dorothy Parker\n |title= What's a Modern Girl to Do?\n |newspaper= The New York Times\n |quote= ...What our grandmothers told us about playing hard to get is true. ...\n |year= 2005\n |url= https://www.nytimes.com/2005/10/30/magazine/30feminism.html\n |accessdate= 2010-12-08\n}}</ref> in other parts of the world, such as in South Asia and many parts of the Middle East, being alone in public as a couple is not only frowned upon but can even lead to either person being socially ostracized.\n\nIn the twentieth century, dating was sometimes seen as a precursor to marriage but it could also be considered as an end-in-itself, that is, an informal social activity akin to [[friendship]].

[[effects of the automobile on societies|Cars]] extended the range of dating as well as enabled back-seat sexual exploration. In the mid-twentieth century, the advent of [[birth control]] as well as safer procedures for [[abortion]] changed the equation considerably, and there was less pressure to marry as a means for satisfying sexual urges. New types of relationships formed; it was possible for people to live together without marrying and without [[children]]. Information about [[human sexuality]] grew, and with it an acceptance of all types of sexual orientations is becoming more common. Today, the institution of dating continues to evolve at a rapid rate with new possibilities and choices opening up particularly through [[online dating]].\n\n=== Etymology ===\nThe word \"dating\" entered the American language during the [[Roaring Twenties]]. Prior to that, courtship was a matter of family and community interest. Starting around the time of the [[American Civil War|Civil War]], courtship became a private matter for couples.<ref>{{cite web|last=Hirsch|first=Elaine|title=The History of Dating and Communication|url=http://www.communicationstudies.com/the-history-of-dating-and-communication|accessdate=6 May 2012}}</ref>\n\n== As a social relationship ==\n\n=== Wide variation in behavior patterns ===\n[[File:Mary Poppins8.jpg|thumb|right|[[Julie Andrews]] as [[Mary Poppins (character)|Mary Poppins]].]]\n{{quote|text=And the only rule is that there are no rules.|sign=[[Kira Cochrane]]<ref name=twsDecH27a134kcc />}}\nSocial rules regarding dating vary considerably according to variables such as country, social class, race, religion, age, sexual orientation and gender. Behavior patterns are generally unwritten and constantly changing. There are considerable differences between social and personal [[Value (personal and cultural)|values]]. Each culture has particular patterns which determine such choices as whether the man asks the woman out, where people might meet, whether kissing is acceptable on a first date, the substance of conversation, who should pay for meals or entertainment,<ref name=\"twsDecH26j\">{{cite news\n |author= Maureen Dowd quoting poet Dorothy Parker\n |title= What's a Modern Girl to Do?\n |newspaper= The New York Times\n |year= 2005\n |url= https://www.nytimes.com/2005/10/30/magazine/30feminism.html\n |accessdate= 2010-12-08\n}}</ref><ref name=whopaysondate>{{cite news\n |author       = Bonny Albo\n |title        = Who pays on a date?\n |publisher    = Dating on About.com\n |url          = http://dating.about.com/od/trickydatingquestions/f/whopays.htm\n |accessdate   = 2011-02-20\n |archive-url  = https://web.archive.org/web/20110105221232/http://dating.about.com/od/trickydatingquestions/f/whopays.htm\n |archive-date = 2011-01-05\n |url-status     = dead\n}}</ref> or whether splitting expenses is allowed.

For example, director [[Blake Edwards]] wanted to date singing star [[Julie Andrews]], and he joked in parties about her persona by saying that her \"endlessly cheerful governess\" image from movies such as ''[[Mary Poppins (film)|Mary Poppins]]'' and ''[[The Sound of Music (film)|The Sound of Music]]'' gave her the image of possibly having \"lilacs for pubic hair\";<ref name=twsDecQ>{{cite news\n |title= Blake Edwards, Prolific Comedy Director, Dies at 88\n |newspaper= The New York Times\n |quote= ... \u201cShe has lilacs for pubic hair.\u201d ...\n |date= December 16, 2010\n |url= https://www.nytimes.com/2010/12/17/movies/17edwards.html\n |accessdate= 2010-12-17\n}}</ref> Andrews appreciated his humor, sent him lilacs, dated him and later married him, and the couple stayed together for 41 years until his death in 2010.<ref name=twsDecQ />\n\n=== Different meanings of the term ===\nWhile the term ''dating'' has many meanings, the most common refers to a trial period in which two people explore whether to take the relationship further towards a more permanent relationship; in this sense, dating refers to the time when people are physically together in public as opposed to the earlier time period in which people are arranging the date, perhaps by corresponding by email or text or phone.<ref name=twsDecH27der5 /> Another meaning of the term ''dating'' is to describe a stage in a person's life when he or she is actively pursuing romantic relationships with different people. If two unmarried celebrities are seen in public together, they are often described as \"dating\" which means they were seen in public together, and it is not clear whether they are merely friends, exploring a more intimate relationship, or are romantically involved. A related sense of the term is when two people have been out in public only a few times but have not yet committed to a relationship; in this sense, ''dating'' describes an initial trial period and can be contrasted with \"being in a committed relationship\".\n\n=== Evaluation ===\nOne of the main purposes of dating is for two or more people to evaluate one another's suitability as a long term companion or spouse.{{citation needed|date=December 2019}} Often physical characteristics, personality, financial status, and other aspects of the involved persons are judged and, as a result, feelings can be hurt and confidence shaken. Because of the uncertainty of the whole situation, the desire to be acceptable to the other person, and the possibility of rejection, dating can be very stressful for all parties involved. Some studies have shown that dating tends to be extremely difficult for people with [[social anxiety disorder]].<ref>Stevens, Sarah B., and Tracy L.

In addition to the detrimental effects of upholding limited views of relationships and sexual and romantic desires, stereotypes also lead to framing social problems in a problematic way. For example, some have noted that educated women in many countries including [[Italy]] and [[Russia]], and the [[United States]] find it difficult to have a [[career]] as well as raise a family, prompting a number of writers to suggest how women should approach dating and how to time their careers and personal life. The advice comes with the assumption that the work-life balance is inherently a \"woman's problem.\" In many societies, there is a view that women should fulfill the role of primary caregivers, with little to no spousal support and with few services by employers or government such as parental leave or child care. Accordingly, an issue regarding dating is the subject of career timing which generates controversy. Some views reflect a traditional notion of gender roles. For example, [[Danielle Crittenden]] in ''What Our Mothers Didn't Tell Us'' argued that having both a career and family at the same time was taxing and stressful for a woman; as a result, she suggested that women should date in their early twenties with a seriousness of purpose, marry when their relative beauty permitted them to find a reliable partner, have children, then return to work in their early thirties with kids in school; Crittenden acknowledged that splitting a career path with a ten-year baby-raising hiatus posed difficulties.<ref name=twsDecxfpu89>{{cite news\n |author= David Gergen engages Danielle Crittenden\n |title= interview about: What Our Mothers Didn't Tell Us: Why Happiness Eludes the Modern Woman (excerpts)\n |publisher= [[PBS]]\n |date= March 1, 1999\n |url= https://www.pbs.org/newshour/gergen/march99/gergen_3-1.html\n |accessdate= 2011-02-04\n}}</ref> There are contrasting views which suggest that women should focus on careers in their twenties and thirties.

Illegitimate relationships before marriage are considered a social taboo and social interaction between unmarried men and women is encouraged at a modest and healthy level. Couples are usually wedded through either an [[arranged marriage]] or [[love marriage]]. Love marriages are those in which the individuals have chosen a partner whom they like by their own choice prior to marriage, and usually occur with the consent of parents and family. Arranged marriages on the other hand are marriages which are set and agreed by the families or guardians of the two individuals where the couple may not have met before. In either cases and in consistency with traditional marital practices, individuals who marry are persuaded to meet and talk to each other for some time before considering marrying so that they can check their compatibility.\n\n==== Singapore ====\n[[Singapore]]'s largest dating service, SDU, [[Social Development Unit]], is a government-run dating system.

Strolling on [[Esplanade]]s and Promenade walkways such as the one in Hamburg called the [[Jungfernstieg]] (maidens way), have been another venue for introductions as early as the 19th century. Analyst [[Geoffrey Gorer]] described dating as an American [[idiosyncrasy]] focusing on youth of college age and expressed in activities such as American [[prom]]s. In contrast German speaking countries and the longstanding musical tradition there provided ample opportunity of persons of varying ages enjoying social dances, such as the [[Vienna Opera Ball]] and other occasions.\n\nRomantic encounters were often described with [[French language|French]] terms like [[wikt:rendezvous|rendezvous]] or [[wikt:t\u00eate-\u00e0-t\u00eate|t\u00eate-\u00e0-t\u00eate]]. The [[German language|German]] term of ''Stelldichein'' (as translated by [[Joachim Heinrich Campe]]s) is used to signify dating when the age of consent to marriage was relatively high.

An example is meeting perhaps twenty potential partners in a bar with brief interviews between each possible couple, perhaps lasting three minutes in length, and shuffling partners. In [[Shanghai, China|Shanghai]], one event featured eight-minute one-on-one meetings in which participants were pre-screened by age and education and career, and which costs 50 yuan ($6 USD) per participant; participants are asked not to reveal contact information during the brief meeting with the other person, but rather place names in cards for organizers to arrange subsequent dates.<ref name=twsDecI24>{{cite news\n |author= Jin Haili\n |title= The fast way to fall in love\n |newspaper= China Daily\n |date= 2004-09-16\n |url= http://www.chinadaily.com.cn/english/doc/2004-09/16/content_375019.htm\n |accessdate= 2010-12-09\n}}</ref> Advantages of speed dating: efficiency; \"avoids an embarrassing disaster date\"; cost-effective; way to make friends.<ref name=twsDecI24 /> Disadvantages: it can turn into a beauty contest with only a few good-looking participants getting most offers, while less attractive peers received few or no offers; critics suggest that the format prevents factors such as personality and [[intelligence]] from emerging, particularly in large groups with extra-brief meeting times.<ref name=twsDecI25>{{cite news\n |title= Speed dating all about looks and not personality\n |newspaper= China Daily\n |quote= ...

Its citizens, people of humble means, who inhabited the southern territories of the Iberian Peninsula and occupied low-level jobs, also served as street vendors selling bu\u00f1uelos. In Seville and Granada, honey-fried bu\u00f1uelos covered in honey were typical dessert. On the other hand, this specialty was adopted by the gypsies after the Moorish expulsion and perpetuated until today.\n\nA 19th century recipe from California, described as ''pasta de freir'' (dough to fry) is made by folding whipped egg whites into a mixture of flour, water, sugar, oil and [[orange blossom water]]. This is used as a batter to fry apples or other types of fruit. A variation called ''suspiros de monjas'' (nun's sighs) includes butter and egg yolks. ''Bu\u00f1uelos de Valparaiso'' are garnished with [[walnuts]] and [[sherry]] or [[maraschino]] flavored [[simple syrup]].<ref>''El cocinero espa\u00f1ol'' by Encarnaci\u00f3n Pinedo, 1898</ref>\n\n==Regional adaptations==\n[[File:Home-made bu\u00f1uelos.JPG|thumb|Home-made Colombian Bu\u00f1uelos]]\n[[File:Cascaron- fried mochi balls (12486482804).jpg|thumb|''[[Cascaron]]'', a [[Philippine cuisine|Filipino]] derivative made with ground [[glutinous rice]]]]\n[[File:Philippine bu\u00f1uelo (bunwelo) doughnuts with ube filling.jpg|thumb|[[Philippine cuisine|Filipino]] ''bunwelos'' with [[ube halaya|ube]] filling]]\n*In [[Spain]], the bu\u00f1uelos are a dessert and snack typical in many autonomous communities and, especially, during their regional holidays.

In that recipe, flour and cheese balls were fried and served with a spread made of honey and poppy seeds.<ref> After Cato's, the first known recipe for a dough for donuts seems to be the collection by [[Apicio]], in his work '' [[De re coquinaria]], '' in the first century of the Christian era.</ref>\n\nThe first society, after the Roman one, that consumed bu\u00f1uelos was the [[Moorish | Moorish]]. Its citizens, people of humble means, who inhabited the southern territories of the Iberian Peninsula and occupied low-level jobs, also served as street vendors selling bu\u00f1uelos. In Seville and Granada, honey-fried bu\u00f1uelos covered in honey were typical dessert. On the other hand, this specialty was adopted by the gypsies after the Moorish expulsion and perpetuated until today.\n\nA 19th century recipe from California, described as ''pasta de freir'' (dough to fry) is made by folding whipped egg whites into a mixture of flour, water, sugar, oil and [[orange blossom water]]. This is used as a batter to fry apples or other types of fruit. A variation called ''suspiros de monjas'' (nun's sighs) includes butter and egg yolks. ''Bu\u00f1uelos de Valparaiso'' are garnished with [[walnuts]] and [[sherry]] or [[maraschino]] flavored [[simple syrup]].<ref>''El cocinero espa\u00f1ol'' by Encarnaci\u00f3n Pinedo, 1898</ref>\n\n==Regional adaptations==\n[[File:Home-made bu\u00f1uelos.JPG|thumb|Home-made Colombian Bu\u00f1uelos]]\n[[File:Cascaron- fried mochi balls (12486482804).jpg|thumb|''[[Cascaron]]'', a [[Philippine cuisine|Filipino]] derivative made with ground [[glutinous rice]]]]\n[[File:Philippine bu\u00f1uelo (bunwelo) doughnuts with ube filling.jpg|thumb|[[Philippine cuisine|Filipino]] ''bunwelos'' with [[ube halaya|ube]] filling]]\n*In [[Spain]], the bu\u00f1uelos are a dessert and snack typical in many autonomous communities and, especially, during their regional holidays. Each territory incorporates its own ingredients and its own tradition. One of the best known is the wind bu\u00f1uelo, a species of [[fritter]].\n[[File: Bunyols amb xocolate.jpg | thumb | Chocolate fritters.]]\n\nIn [[Catalonia]], they are consumed mostly during [[Lent]].

On the other hand, in Catalonia, churros are almost only consumed by tourists, the Catalans prefer the `` [[xuixo]] s '' or `` chuchos '' in churrer\u00edas or the bu\u00f1uelos in their multiple forms in bakeries, bakeries or in houses .\n\n* In [[Colombia]] they are made with a small curd white cheese and formed into doughy balls then fried golden brown. It is a traditional [[Christmas dish]], served along with ''[[natillas]]'' and ''[[manjar blanco]]''.\n* In [[Cuba]] they are traditionally twisted in a figure 8 and covered in an [[anise]] [[caramel]]. The dough contains [[cassava]] and [[Eddoe|malanga]].\n* In the [[Dominican Republic]], bu\u00f1uelos are rolled into balls from a dough made of cassava (called yuca) and eggs. They are then covered in a cinnamon sugar syrup, often using coconut milk instead of water.\n* In [[Nicaragua]], bu\u00f1uelos are made from, cassava, eggs, and white grating cheese. The bu\u00f1uelos are rolled into balls and deep fried. They are served alongside a syrup made of sugar, water, cinnamon sticks, and cloves.
