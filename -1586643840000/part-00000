Most people who entered the legal profession did so through an [[apprenticeship]] which incorporated a period of study under the supervision of an experienced attorney. This usually encompassed the reading of the works considered at the time to be the most authoritative on the law, such as [[Edward Coke]]'s ''[[Institutes of the Lawes of England]]'', [[William Blackstone]]'s ''[[Commentaries on the Laws of England]]'', and similar texts.<ref>{{harvp|Harno|1953|pp=19\u201320}}.</ref>\n\nThe scholastic independence of the law student is evident from the following advice of [[Abraham Lincoln]] to a young man in 1855:\n\n{{quote|If you are absolutely determined to make a lawyer of yourself the thing is more than half done already.

It is no consequence to be in a large town while you are reading. I read at New Salem, which never had three hundred people in it.

It was replaced by the [[United States biological defense program]].\n\n==History==\n\n===Early history (1918\u20131941)===\n\nThe '''[[United States]] [[biological weapons]] program''' officially began in spring 1943 on orders from U.S. President [[Franklin Roosevelt]]. Research continued following [[World War II]] as the U.S. built up a large stockpile of [[biological agent]]s and [[biological weapon|weapons]]. Over the course of its 27-year history, the program weaponized and stockpiled the following seven [[bio-agent]]s (and pursued basic research on many more):\n\n*''[[Bacillus anthracis]]'' ([[anthrax]])\n*''[[Francisella tularensis]]'' ([[tularemia]])\n*''[[Brucella]]'' spp ([[brucellosis]])\n*''[[Coxiella burnetii]]'' ([[Q-fever]])\n*[[Venezuelan equine encephalitis virus|Venezuelan equine encephalitis virus (VEE)]]\n*[[Botulinum toxin]] ([[botulism]])\n*[[Staphylococcal enterotoxin B]]\nThroughout its history, the U.S. bioweapons program was secret. It was later revealed that laboratory and field testing (some of the latter using simulants on non-consenting individuals) had been common. The official policy of the United States was first to deter the use of bio-weapons against U.S. forces and secondarily to retaliate if deterrence failed.\n\nIn 1969, President [[Richard Nixon]] ended all offensive (i.e., non-defensive) aspects of the U.S. bio-weapons program. In 1975 the U.S. ratified both the 1925 [[Geneva Protocol]] and the 1972 [[Biological Weapons Convention]] (BWC)\u2014international treaties outlawing biological warfare. Recent U.S. [[biodefense]] programs, however, have raised concerns that the U.S. may be pursuing research that is outlawed by The United Nations. Initial interest in any form of biological warfare came at the close of [[World War I]]. The only agent the U.S. tested was the toxin [[ricin]], a product of the castor plant.<ref name=\"smart\" /> The U.S. conducted tests concerning two methods of ricin dissemination: the first, which involved adhering the toxin to [[Fragmentation (weaponry)|shrapnel]] for delivery by [[artillery shell]], was successful;<ref name=\"smart\" /> the second, delivering an aerosol cloud of ricin, was proven less successful in these tests.<ref name=\"smart\" /> Neither delivery method was perfected before the war in Europe ended.<ref name=\"smart\">Smart, Jeffery K.

It was later revealed that laboratory and field testing (some of the latter using simulants on non-consenting individuals) had been common. The official policy of the United States was first to deter the use of bio-weapons against U.S. forces and secondarily to retaliate if deterrence failed.\n\nIn 1969, President [[Richard Nixon]] ended all offensive (i.e., non-defensive) aspects of the U.S. bio-weapons program. In 1975 the U.S. ratified both the 1925 [[Geneva Protocol]] and the 1972 [[Biological Weapons Convention]] (BWC)\u2014international treaties outlawing biological warfare. Recent U.S. [[biodefense]] programs, however, have raised concerns that the U.S. may be pursuing research that is outlawed by The United Nations.

Originally introduced from Essex County on March 24, 1880 and revised with input from the Newark Board of Trade in 1881, an act of the New Jersey State Legislature essentially drew up a contest to determine which municipality would become home to the state's urgently needed [[Institute of technology|technical school]]. The challenge was straightforward: the state would stake \"at least $3,000 and not more than $5,000\" and the municipality that matched the state's investment would earn the right to establish the new school.{{citation needed|date=December 2017}}\n\nThe Newark Board of Trade, working jointly with the Newark City Council, launched a campaign to win the new school. Dozens of the city's industrialists, along with other private citizens, eager for a work force resource in their home town, threw their support behind the fund-raiser. By 1884, the collaboration of the public and private sectors produced success. Newark Technical School was ready to open its doors.\n\nThe first 88 students, mostly evening students, attended classes in a rented building at 21 West Park Street. Soon the facility became inadequate to house an expanding student body. To meet the needs of the growing school, a second fund-raiser\u2014the institution's first capital campaign\u2014was launched to support the construction of a dedicated building for Newark Technical School. In 1886, under the leadership of the school's dynamic first director, Dr. Charles A. Colton, the cornerstone was laid at the intersection of High Street and Summit Place for the three-story building later to be named Weston Hall, in honor of the institution's early benefactor. A laboratory building, later to be called Colton Hall, was added to the campus in 1911.\n\n===Becoming Newark College of Engineering===\n\nDr. Allan R. Cullimore led the institution from 1920 to 1949, transforming Newark Technical School into Newark College of Engineering (name adopted in 1930). Campbell Hall was erected in 1925, but due to the [[Great Depression|Depression]] and [[World War II]], only the former Newark Orphan Asylum, now [[Eberhardt Hall, New Jersey Institute of Technology|Eberhardt Hall]], was purchased and renovated by the college in the succeeding decades. Cullimore left an unpublished history of the institution dated 1955.<ref>{{cite web|title=History of the Newark Technical School and the Newark College of Engineering. |author= Allan R. Cullimore |year=1955 |publisher=unpublished manuscript in the Van Houten Library at NJIT, Newark, NJ. |url=http://archives.njit.edu/vhlib/hist-cullimore/njit-hist-cullimore.pdf |accessdate=June 15, 2006}}</ref><!-- Deleted image removed:  [[File:NJIT newarktech1-sm.jpg|thumb|left]] -->\n\nAs of 1946, about 75% of the freshman class had served in the [[U. S. Armed Forces]]. Cullimore Hall was built in 1958 and two years later the old Weston Hall was razed and replaced with the current seven-story structure. [[Doctorate|Doctoral]] level programs were introduced and six years later, in 1966, an {{convert|18|acre|adj=on}}, four-building expansion was completed.\n\n===Becoming New Jersey Institute of Technology===\n\nWith the addition of the New Jersey School of Architecture in 1973, the institution had evolved into a technological university, emphasizing a broad range of graduate and undergraduate degrees and dedicated to significant research and public service. [[William Hazell|President William Hazell, Jr.]], felt that the name of the school should clearly communicate this dynamic evolution.  Alumni were solicited for suggestions to rename the institution, with the winning suggestion coming from Joseph M. Anderson '25.<ref>http://magazine.njit.edu/2015/winter/alumni-circuit.pdf{{Dead link|date=August 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref>\n\nAnderson's suggestion \u2013 New Jersey Institute of Technology \u2013 cogently emphasized the increasing scope of educational and research initiatives at a preeminent New Jersey university. The Board of Trustees approved the transition to the new name in September 1974, and Newark College of Engineering officially became New Jersey Institute of Technology on January 1, 1975. Anderson received the personal congratulations of President Hazell. At that time, the Newark College of Engineering name was retained for NJIT's engineering school.\n\n[[File:Eberhardt Hall NJIT jeh.JPG|thumb|upright|[[Eberhardt Hall, New Jersey Institute of Technology|Eberhardt Hall]] ]] The establishment of a residential campus and the opening of NJIT's first [[dormitory]] (Redwood Hall) in 1979 began a period of steady growth that continues today under the Landscape Master Plan. Two new schools were established at the university during the 1980s, the College of Science and Liberal Arts in 1982 and the School of Industrial Management in 1988. The Albert Dorman Honors College was established in 1994, and the newest school, the College of Computing Sciences, was created in 2001.\n\n===Recent history===\nOn May 2, 2003 [[Robert Altenkirch|Robert A.

Construction of a new [[Atrium (architecture)|Atrium]], [[Bookstore]], Information Desk, Dining Hall, [[computer lab]], and new student organization offices continued into 2004. In 2005 a row of automobile [[chop shop]]s adjacent to campus were demolished. In 2006 construction of a new off-campus residence hall by American Campus Communities commenced in the chop shops' location. The new hall, which opened in 2007, is dubbed the University Centre.\n\nAlso in 2005, Eberhardt Hall was fully renovated and re-inaugurated as the Alumni Center and the symbolic front door to the university. Its restored tower was the logo of the former Newark College of Engineering and was designed by Kevin Boyajian and Scott Nelson. A rebranding campaign with the current [[slogan]], \"NJIT \u2013 New Jersey's Science and Technology University \u2013 The Edge in Knowledge\", was launched to emphasize NJIT\u2019s unique position as [[New Jersey]]'s preeminent science-and-technology-focused research university.\n\nRecently, the school changed its accredited management school into an AACSB-accredited business school. The business school focuses on utilizing technology to serve business needs. The school benefits from its proximity to [[New York City]]; in particular, [[Wall Street]] is just twenty-five minutes away. The school also has a strong academic collaboration with the nearby [[Rutgers]] business school. In 2008 NJIT began a program with the [[Heritage Institute of Technology]] (HIT) in West Bengal, India under which 20 HIT students come to NJIT for summer internships.\n\nIn 2009 the New Jersey School of Architecture was reorganized as the College of Architecture and Design (CoAD). Within the college, the New Jersey School of Architecture continues, and it was joined by the newly established School of Art + Design.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.njit.edu/news/2009/2009-055.php |title=NJIT: News: News Archives |publisher=Njit.edu |accessdate=2015-04-02 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120319202717/http://www.njit.edu/news/2009/2009-055.php |archive-date=2012-03-19 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\nIn June 2010, NJIT officially completed its purchase of the old [[Central High School (Newark, New Jersey)|Central High School]] building<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.njit.edu/president/docs/2010/2010-06-24-central-high.php |title=NJIT: Office of the President: Status of Central High |publisher=Njit.edu |date=2010-06-24 |accessdate=2015-04-02 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110103200958/http://www.njit.edu/president/docs/2010/2010-06-24-central-high.php |archive-date=2011-01-03 |url-status=dead }}</ref> which sits between the NJIT and [[Rutgers\u2013Newark]] campuses.

Originally introduced from Essex County on March 24, 1880 and revised with input from the Newark Board of Trade in 1881, an act of the New Jersey State Legislature essentially drew up a contest to determine which municipality would become home to the state's urgently needed [[Institute of technology|technical school]]. The challenge was straightforward: the state would stake \"at least $3,000 and not more than $5,000\" and the municipality that matched the state's investment would earn the right to establish the new school.{{citation needed|date=December 2017}}\n\nThe Newark Board of Trade, working jointly with the Newark City Council, launched a campaign to win the new school. Dozens of the city's industrialists, along with other private citizens, eager for a work force resource in their home town, threw their support behind the fund-raiser. By 1884, the collaboration of the public and private sectors produced success. Newark Technical School was ready to open its doors.\n\nThe first 88 students, mostly evening students, attended classes in a rented building at 21 West Park Street. Soon the facility became inadequate to house an expanding student body. To meet the needs of the growing school, a second fund-raiser\u2014the institution's first capital campaign\u2014was launched to support the construction of a dedicated building for Newark Technical School. In 1886, under the leadership of the school's dynamic first director, Dr. Charles A. Colton, the cornerstone was laid at the intersection of High Street and Summit Place for the three-story building later to be named Weston Hall, in honor of the institution's early benefactor. A laboratory building, later to be called Colton Hall, was added to the campus in 1911.\n\n===Becoming Newark College of Engineering===\n\nDr. Allan R. Cullimore led the institution from 1920 to 1949, transforming Newark Technical School into Newark College of Engineering (name adopted in 1930). Campbell Hall was erected in 1925, but due to the [[Great Depression|Depression]] and [[World War II]], only the former Newark Orphan Asylum, now [[Eberhardt Hall, New Jersey Institute of Technology|Eberhardt Hall]], was purchased and renovated by the college in the succeeding decades. Cullimore left an unpublished history of the institution dated 1955.<ref>{{cite web|title=History of the Newark Technical School and the Newark College of Engineering. |author= Allan R. Cullimore |year=1955 |publisher=unpublished manuscript in the Van Houten Library at NJIT, Newark, NJ. |url=http://archives.njit.edu/vhlib/hist-cullimore/njit-hist-cullimore.pdf |accessdate=June 15, 2006}}</ref><!-- Deleted image removed:  [[File:NJIT newarktech1-sm.jpg|thumb|left]] -->\n\nAs of 1946, about 75% of the freshman class had served in the [[U. S. Armed Forces]]. Cullimore Hall was built in 1958 and two years later the old Weston Hall was razed and replaced with the current seven-story structure. [[Doctorate|Doctoral]] level programs were introduced and six years later, in 1966, an {{convert|18|acre|adj=on}}, four-building expansion was completed.\n\n===Becoming New Jersey Institute of Technology===\n\nWith the addition of the New Jersey School of Architecture in 1973, the institution had evolved into a technological university, emphasizing a broad range of graduate and undergraduate degrees and dedicated to significant research and public service. [[William Hazell|President William Hazell, Jr.]], felt that the name of the school should clearly communicate this dynamic evolution.  Alumni were solicited for suggestions to rename the institution, with the winning suggestion coming from Joseph M. Anderson '25.<ref>http://magazine.njit.edu/2015/winter/alumni-circuit.pdf{{Dead link|date=August 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref>\n\nAnderson's suggestion \u2013 New Jersey Institute of Technology \u2013 cogently emphasized the increasing scope of educational and research initiatives at a preeminent New Jersey university. The Board of Trustees approved the transition to the new name in September 1974, and Newark College of Engineering officially became New Jersey Institute of Technology on January 1, 1975. Anderson received the personal congratulations of President Hazell. At that time, the Newark College of Engineering name was retained for NJIT's engineering school.\n\n[[File:Eberhardt Hall NJIT jeh.JPG|thumb|upright|[[Eberhardt Hall, New Jersey Institute of Technology|Eberhardt Hall]] ]] The establishment of a residential campus and the opening of NJIT's first [[dormitory]] (Redwood Hall) in 1979 began a period of steady growth that continues today under the Landscape Master Plan. Two new schools were established at the university during the 1980s, the College of Science and Liberal Arts in 1982 and the School of Industrial Management in 1988. The Albert Dorman Honors College was established in 1994, and the newest school, the College of Computing Sciences, was created in 2001.\n\n===Recent history===\nOn May 2, 2003 [[Robert Altenkirch|Robert A.

Construction of a new [[Atrium (architecture)|Atrium]], [[Bookstore]], Information Desk, Dining Hall, [[computer lab]], and new student organization offices continued into 2004. In 2005 a row of automobile [[chop shop]]s adjacent to campus were demolished. In 2006 construction of a new off-campus residence hall by American Campus Communities commenced in the chop shops' location. The new hall, which opened in 2007, is dubbed the University Centre.\n\nAlso in 2005, Eberhardt Hall was fully renovated and re-inaugurated as the Alumni Center and the symbolic front door to the university. Its restored tower was the logo of the former Newark College of Engineering and was designed by Kevin Boyajian and Scott Nelson. A rebranding campaign with the current [[slogan]], \"NJIT \u2013 New Jersey's Science and Technology University \u2013 The Edge in Knowledge\", was launched to emphasize NJIT\u2019s unique position as [[New Jersey]]'s preeminent science-and-technology-focused research university.\n\nRecently, the school changed its accredited management school into an AACSB-accredited business school. The business school focuses on utilizing technology to serve business needs. The school benefits from its proximity to [[New York City]]; in particular, [[Wall Street]] is just twenty-five minutes away. The school also has a strong academic collaboration with the nearby [[Rutgers]] business school. In 2008 NJIT began a program with the [[Heritage Institute of Technology]] (HIT) in West Bengal, India under which 20 HIT students come to NJIT for summer internships.\n\nIn 2009 the New Jersey School of Architecture was reorganized as the College of Architecture and Design (CoAD). Within the college, the New Jersey School of Architecture continues, and it was joined by the newly established School of Art + Design.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.njit.edu/news/2009/2009-055.php |title=NJIT: News: News Archives |publisher=Njit.edu |accessdate=2015-04-02 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120319202717/http://www.njit.edu/news/2009/2009-055.php |archive-date=2012-03-19 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\nIn June 2010, NJIT officially completed its purchase of the old [[Central High School (Newark, New Jersey)|Central High School]] building<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.njit.edu/president/docs/2010/2010-06-24-central-high.php |title=NJIT: Office of the President: Status of Central High |publisher=Njit.edu |date=2010-06-24 |accessdate=2015-04-02 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110103200958/http://www.njit.edu/president/docs/2010/2010-06-24-central-high.php |archive-date=2011-01-03 |url-status=dead }}</ref> which sits between the NJIT and [[Rutgers\u2013Newark]] campuses.
