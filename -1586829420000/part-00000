The spacecraft launches atop a [[Falcon 9 Block 5]] rocket and returns to Earth via an ocean [[splashdown]]. Unlike its predecessor, the spacecraft can dock itself to the ISS instead of being berthed.  It has two variants; '''Crew Dragon''', a [[Human-rating certification|human-rated]] [[Space capsule|capsule]] capable of ferrying up to seven astronauts, and '''Cargo Dragon''', an updated replacement for the original Dragon spacecraft. Crew Dragon is equipped with an integrated [[launch escape system]] in a set of four side-mounted thruster pods with two [[SuperDraco]] engines each. The spacecraft features redesigned [[Solar panels on spacecraft|solar arrays]] and a modified outer mold line compared to the original Dragon, and possess new [[flight computer]]s and [[avionics]]. As of March 2020, four Dragon 2 spacecraft have been manufactured (not counting structural test articles that were never airborne); a test article named ''[[SpaceX DragonFly|Dragonfly]]'' and three flightworthy vehicles, one of which was destroyed in an engine test.\n\nCrew Dragon serves as one of two spacecraft that will shuttle crews to and from the [[International Space Station]] (ISS) under [[NASA]]'s [[Commercial Crew Program]], the other being the [[Boeing CST-100 Starliner]]. It will also be used in flights by American [[space tourism]] company [[Space Adventures]] and to shuttle tourists to and from [[Axiom Space]]'s planned space station. Crew Dragon's [[Crew Dragon Demo-1|first non-piloted test flight]] occurred in March 2019, and its [[Crew Dragon Demo-2|first crewed flight]] \u2013 with astronauts [[Robert L. Behnken]] and [[Douglas G. Hurley]] \u2013 is planned to occur in May 2020. Cargo Dragon will [[space logistics|supply cargo]] to the ISS under a [[Commercial Resupply Services#Commercial Resupply Services 2|Commercial Resupply Services-2]] contract with NASA, along with [[Northrop Grumman Innovation Systems]]' [[Cygnus (spacecraft)|Cygnus]] spacecraft and [[Sierra Nevada Corporation]]'s [[Dream Chaser]] spacecraft. The [[SpaceX CRS-21|first flight]] of the Dragon 2 variant of Cargo Dragon is planned to launch in October 2020.\n\n== Development and variants==\n[[File:Dragon V2 01.png|thumb|The depictions of the Crew Dragon's 2014 design from various angles.

Dragon|Dragon]] [[cargo spacecraft]]. The spacecraft launches atop a [[Falcon 9 Block 5]] rocket and returns to Earth via an ocean [[splashdown]]. Unlike its predecessor, the spacecraft can dock itself to the ISS instead of being berthed.  It has two variants; '''Crew Dragon''', a [[Human-rating certification|human-rated]] [[Space capsule|capsule]] capable of ferrying up to seven astronauts, and '''Cargo Dragon''', an updated replacement for the original Dragon spacecraft. Crew Dragon is equipped with an integrated [[launch escape system]] in a set of four side-mounted thruster pods with two [[SuperDraco]] engines each. The spacecraft features redesigned [[Solar panels on spacecraft|solar arrays]] and a modified outer mold line compared to the original Dragon, and possess new [[flight computer]]s and [[avionics]]. As of March 2020, four Dragon 2 spacecraft have been manufactured (not counting structural test articles that were never airborne); a test article named ''[[SpaceX DragonFly|Dragonfly]]'' and three flightworthy vehicles, one of which was destroyed in an engine test.\n\nCrew Dragon serves as one of two spacecraft that will shuttle crews to and from the [[International Space Station]] (ISS) under [[NASA]]'s [[Commercial Crew Program]], the other being the [[Boeing CST-100 Starliner]]. It will also be used in flights by American [[space tourism]] company [[Space Adventures]] and to shuttle tourists to and from [[Axiom Space]]'s planned space station. Crew Dragon's [[Crew Dragon Demo-1|first non-piloted test flight]] occurred in March 2019, and its [[Crew Dragon Demo-2|first crewed flight]] \u2013 with astronauts [[Robert L. Behnken]] and [[Douglas G. Hurley]] \u2013 is planned to occur in May 2020. Cargo Dragon will [[space logistics|supply cargo]] to the ISS under a [[Commercial Resupply Services#Commercial Resupply Services 2|Commercial Resupply Services-2]] contract with NASA, along with [[Northrop Grumman Innovation Systems]]' [[Cygnus (spacecraft)|Cygnus]] spacecraft and [[Sierra Nevada Corporation]]'s [[Dream Chaser]] spacecraft. The [[SpaceX CRS-21|first flight]] of the Dragon 2 variant of Cargo Dragon is planned to launch in October 2020.\n\n== Development and variants==\n[[File:Dragon V2 01.png|thumb|The depictions of the Crew Dragon's 2014 design from various angles.

The vehicle used for this ground test will also be used for the following in-flight abort test.<ref>https://spaceflightnow.com/2019/11/13/spacex-fires-up-crew-dragon-thrusters-in-key-test-after-april-explosion/</ref>\n\nSome of the modifications are:\n\n* Replacement of the valves with [[burst disc]]s: Unlike valves, burst discs are designed for single use. \n* Addition of flaps on each SuperDraco in order to reseal the thrusters prior to splashdown in the ocean, preventing water intrusion.<ref>https://www.teslarati.com/spacex-fires-redesigned-crew-dragon-superdraco-flaps/</ref>\n\n===In-Flight Abort Test===\n{{main|Crew Dragon In-Flight Abort Test}}\n[[File:KSC-20200119-PH-AWG04 0008.jpg|thumb|Liftoff of Crew Dragon In-Flight Abort Test.]]\n\nThe Crew Dragon In-flight abort test was launched on 19 January 2020 at 15:30 UTC from [[Kennedy Space Center Launch Complex 39|Launch Complex 39A]] on a [[Sub-orbital spaceflight|suborbital]] trajectory to conduct a separation and abort scenario in the [[troposphere]] at [[transonic]] velocities shortly after passing through [[Max q|max Q]], where the vehicle experiences maximum aerodynamic pressure. The Dragon 2 used its [[SuperDraco]] abort engines to push itself away from the Falcon 9 after an intentional premature engine cutoff. The spacecraft followed its suborbital trajectory to apogee, at which point the spacecraft's trunk was jettisoned. The smaller [[SpaceX Draco|Draco]] engines were then used to orient the vehicle for the descent. All major functions were executed, including separation, engine firings, parachute deployment, and landing. Dragon 2 splashed down at 15:38:54 UTC just off the Florida coast in the Atlantic Ocean.<ref>https://www.nasa.gov/press-release/nasa-spacex-complete-final-major-flight-test-of-crew-spacecraft</ref> The test objective was to demonstrate the ability to safely move away from the ascending rocket under the most challenging atmospheric conditions of the flight trajectory, imposing the worst structural stress of a real flight on the rocket and spacecraft.<ref name=nsf20140828/> The abort test was performed using a Falcon 9 Block 5 rocket with a fully fueled second stage with a mass simulator replacing the [[SpaceX Merlin|Merlin]] engine.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.spaceflightinsider.com/organizations/space-exploration-technologies/second-spacex-crew-flight-ordered-nasa/|title=Second SpaceX Crew Flight Ordered by NASA|work=Spaceflight Insider|first=Derek|last=Richardson|date=30 July 2016|access-date=9 August 2016|quote=Currently, the first uncrewed test of the spacecraft is expected to launch in May 2017.

The [[Manchu people]] founded the [[Qing dynasty]].\n\nThe Han Chinese banners were known as the \"Nikan\" Banners, made out of a massive number of Chinese POWs and defectors. [[Jurchen people|Jurchen]] women married most of these Chinese since they came with no family of their own.<ref name=\"Crossley, 2010, p. 95\">Kagan (2010) p. 95</ref> There were so many Han Chinese entering the Banners that there were more of them than the Jurchen.<ref name=\"Crossley, 2010, p. 95\"/> Attempts by [[Hung Taiji]] were made to separate Han Chinese and Jurchen banners. In Chinese and Jurchen of Liaodong were mixed in culture. Many bannermen forged genealogies of their origin since they did not have any, and then these decided whether or not they were in a Chinese or a Jurchen banner.<ref name=\"Crossley, 2010, p. 95\"/> The Eight Banners were then created from the old black Han Chinese banners and Jurchen banners and made equal to each other. The Mongol Eight banners were also created at this time, and anyone who was not classified into a Chinese or a Mongol banner became a Manchu, an ethnic group which Hung Taiji created.<ref name=\"Kagan 2010\">Kagan (2010)</ref>\n\nManchu bannermen and Han bannermen were not categorized according to blood or ancestry or genealogy; they were categorized by their language, culture, behavior, identification and way of life. Many Chinese bannermen (Hanjun, or Han Bannermen) were descended from Sinicized Jurchen who spoke Chinese and served the Ming, while some ethnic Manchu Bannermen (Baqi Manzhou) were of ethnic Han origins who had defected to the Jurchens, assimilated into Jurchen language and culture and lived among them in Jilin before 1618.\n\nThe Qing regarded Chinese Bannermen (Hanjun, or Han Bannermen) and the non Bannerman Han civilian general population (Han min, Han ren, minren) as separate. People were grouped into Manchu Banners and Chinese Banners (Hanjun, or Han Bannermen)  not based on their ancestry, race or blood, but based on their culture and the language they spoke. Han who deserted the Ming and who had moved to Nurgan (Jilin) as transfrontiersmen before 1618 assimilated with the Jurchen, practiced Jurchen culture and spoke Jurchen became part of the ethnic Manchu Banners, while descendants of sinicized Jurchen who had moved to Liaodong, adopted Han culture and surname, and swore loyalty to the Ming and spoke Chinese, eventually became part of the Chinese Banners (Hanjun, or Han Bannermen)  after being conquered by Nurhaci after 1618.\n\nHan who actively defected to the Jurchen in Nurgan before 1618 were called \"transfrontiersman\" since they crossed the frontier over into Jurchen territory and adopted Jurchen identity and later became part of the Manchu Banners, while Han in Ming ruled Liaodong who only defected after the Qing conquered Liaoding were called \"frontiersman\" since they only lived on the frontier of Ming territory and they were put into the Chinese Banners (Hanjun, or Han Bannermen) .\n\nHan Chinese defectors who fled from the Ming joined the Jurchens in Nurgan before 1618 were placed into Manchu Banners and regarded as Manchu, but the Ming residents of Liaodong who were incorporated into the Eight Banners after the conquest of Liaodong from the Ming from 1618-1643 were placed into the separate Chinese Banners (Chinese:Hanjun, Manchu: Nikan cooha or Ujen cooha), and many of these Chinese Bannermen (Hanjun, or Han Bannermen) from Liaodong had Jurchen ancestry and were not classified as Manchu by the Qing.<ref name=\"Crossley 1999\">Crossley (1999)</ref> Geography, culture, language, occupation and lifestyle were the factors used by Nurhaci's Jianzhou Jurchen Khanate to classify people as Jurchen or Nikan, those who were considered Jurchen lived in a Jurchen lifestyle, used the Jurchen language and inhabited the eastern part were considered Jurchen, while those who were considered by Nurhaci as Nikan (Han Chinese) even though some of these Nikan were of Korean or Jurchen ancestry, were the ones who used Chinese language, and inhabited villages and towns on the west.<ref name=\"Crossley 1999\" />\n\nPeople from both sides often moved over the cultural and territorial division between the Ming Liaodong and Jurchen Nurgan; Han Chinese soldiers and peasants moved into Nurgan while Jurchen mercenaries and merchants moved to Liaodong, with some lineages ended up being dispersed on both sides, and the Jurchen viewed people as Nikan depending on whether they acted like Han Chinese. People from the same lineage like the Sinicized Jurchen Tong lineage of Fushun in Liaodong served both Ming and the Qing, with some like Tong Bunian staying as diehard Ming loyalists and others having faithfully serving the Qing conquest, after Liaodong was conquered and the Tong were enrolled in the Han Plain Blue Banner by the Qing. Eventually, the Kangxi Emperor even transferred some members of the Tong lineage like Tong Guogang and a few of his close relatives to the Manchu Bordered Yellow Banner after Tong requested the transfer.<ref name=\"Crossley 1999, pp. 55-56\">Crossley (1999) pp. 55-56</ref><ref name=\"Rawski 1998\">Rawski (1998)</ref><ref>Rowe (2010)</ref><ref name=\"University of California Press\">Watson & Ebrey (1991)</ref>\n\nTong Guogang justified his asking for transfer to a Manchu Banner was because the Tong were of Jurchen origin, but only Tong Guogang's immediate family and company were transferred to the Manchu but the other Tong companies were left as Chinese. It was Qing policy to for every closely related in-law of the emperor to get transferred into a Manchu Banner even if they were from another ethnicity and this was the most probable reason why Tong's request was granted by Kangxi, and more like than his appeal to his Jurchen origin.<ref name=\"Elliott 2001\">Elliott (2001)</ref> The beginning of the Qing showed flexibility and political expedience was used when determining ethnicity, both regarding Tong's transfer from a Han to a Manchu Banner and Han Chinese who assimilated to the Jurchens.<ref name=\"Elliott 2001\" />\n\nThe geographical, political, and cultural division was between the Ming Liaodong and the Jurchen dominated Nurgan, which traded and interacted with Liaodong through Fushun.<ref name=\"Crossley 1999\" />\n\nNurhaci and Hongtaiji both viewed ethnic identity as determined by culture, language, and attitude, not by ancestry (genealogy), and these identities could be changed and people transferred from different ethnic banners to another. Mongols were associated with the Mongolian language, nomadism and horse related activities, Manchus were associated with Manchu language and foremost being part of the Banners, and Han Chinese were associated with inhabiting Liaodong, the Chinese language, agriculture, commerce.<ref name=\"Kagan 2010\" /> Biological determinants and ancestry were disregarded in determining Manchu and Han identities, culture was the primary factor in differentiating between Manchu and Han, and occasionally identities were blurred and could be altered.<ref>Hammond & Stapleton (2008)</ref> The Qing creation of the separate Manchu, Mongol, and Han Banners was not rooted in distinguishable classifications of people, but of fluxing categories defined by the Qing, their membership in the different banners primarily depending on whether they spoke the Manchu, Mongolian, or the Chinese language.<ref name=\"Naquin 2000, p. 371\">Naquin (2000) p. 371</ref> It has been suggested that the Chinese Bannermen (Hanjun, or Han Bannermen) themselves were not very familiar with the exact meaning of \"Hanjun\", as the Qing changed the definition of what it meant to be a Manchu or a Han Bannerman.<ref name=\"Naquin 2000, p. 371\"/>\n\nThe Manchu official [[Duanfang]] had Han Chinese ancestors originating from Zhejiang- towards the end of the Ming, they had defected to the Qing and moved to southern Manchuria from their original home in [[Zhejiang]] province, they changed their surname to Tohoro from Tao to make it sound Manchu and registered it in the Manchu Plain White Banner.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=tgq1miGno-4C&pg=PA55&dq=tao+tohoro+han#v=onepage&q=tao+tohoro+han&f=false|title=Lessons in Being Chinese: Minority Education and Ethnic Identity in Southwest China|first=Mette Halskov|last=Hansen|date=1 October 2011|publisher=University of Washington Press|via=Google Books|isbn=9780295804125}}</ref><ref name=\"Taveirne 2004\">Taveirne (2004)</ref> Since the Manchus were willing to accept assimilated strangers, Han Chinese who defected to the Jurchens or were captured by them had integrated well into Manchu society.<ref name=\"Wakeman 1985\">Wakeman (1985)</ref> These Han Chinese transfrontiersman from Liaodong embraced Manchu customs and changed their names into Manchu to the point where<ref name=\"Wakeman 1985\" /> they identified as Manchu rather than Chinese and resembles Manchus in their speech, behavior, and looks.<ref name=\"Wakeman 1985\" /> It is hard for historians to tell whether a Manchu was originally a Han transfrontiersman since they no longer used Chinese names or regarded themselves as Han Chinese, [[Frederic Wakeman]] suggested that is evidence that the Manchu Dahai's ancestors were Han Chinese transfrontiersman.<ref name=\"Wakeman 1985\" /> The Jurchen headman of Turun-hoton and arch-enemy of Nurhaci, Nikan Wailan, was also suggested to be a Han transfrontiersman by Wakeman, since his name literally meant \"Chinese official\".<ref name=\"Crossley 1999\" />\n\nThe Manchu word for Han, \"Nikan\" was used to describe people who lived like Han Chinese and not their actual ethnic origin, the Han Bannermen (Hanjun) was not an ethnic category and the Han Banners included people of non-Han Chinese blood.<ref name=\"Rawski 1998\" /> When Liaodong was invaded in 1619 by Nurhaci, it became imperative for the Jurchens to secure the loyalty of the Han (Nikan) in Liaodong to their cause, by treating them equally as Jurchens were treated and even seizing Jurchen properties, grains, wealth, possessions and homes to grant them to Han, and having the aristocracy expand to include Han families in order to get Han to defect to Nurhaci's side.<ref name=\"Crossley 1999\" />\n\nSome Han Bannermen and their lineages became successful members of the Qing nobility and their descendants continued to be awarded noble titles, like that of Li Yongfang who was ennobled by Nurhaci as third class viscount and enrolled in the Plain Blue Chinese Banner (Hanjun, or Han Banner), and his descendants continued to be nobles to the final years of Qianlong's rule and were ennobled with even greater titles.<ref name=\"Rawski 1998\" /> The Manchus gave extensive titles and honors and marriage to Aisin Gioro women to pre-1644 Han defectors, like the marriage of Nurhaci's granddaughter to Li Yongfang and his sons registered in the Chinese Plain Blue banner (Hanjun, or Han Banner), and the title granted to the son of a Ming defector, Sun Sike (Sun Ssu-k'o) in the Chinese Plain White Banner, (Hanjun, or Han Banner) and the marriage of one of Kangxi's daughters to his son.<ref name=\"University of California Press\" />\n\nAt the beginning of the Qing, originally the sharpest distinction was drawn by Qing policy to emphasize difference between Han civilians and all Bannermen, and not between Chinese Bannermen (Hanjun, or Han Bannermen) and Manchu Bannermen. The Manchus used Nikan to describe Ming subjects in Liaodong who lived a Chinese lifestyle like sinicized Jurchens, Mongols, and Koreans, and not as a racial term for ethnic Han Chinese. A person only had to be originally a Ming subject and not ethnic Chinese to get categorized as a Han bannerman so people of Jurchen origin ended up in Mongol and Chinese Banners.<ref name=\"University of California Press\"/> Nurhaci used culture to categorize people and allowed Han transfrontiersmen to identify as Manchu after assimilating, and ethnicity was regarded as flexible when Han Chinese and Mongols families were moved by Kangxi to Manchu Banners from their original Mongol and Chinese Banners (Hanjun, or Han Banners) .<ref name=\"University of California Press\" />\n\nLi Yongfang's rewards for surrendering Fushun to the Jurchens and defecting included promotion in rank, Nurhaci's granddaughter as a wife, battling along with Nurhaci and induction into the Jin aristocracy as a Chinese frontiersman, which was different from how Nurhaci handled both the Han transfrontiersmen who assimilated into Manchu identity and captured Han bondservants.<ref name=\"Wakeman 1985\" /> The Chinese frontiersman were inducted into the Han Banners.<ref name=\"Taveirne 2004\" /> Nurhaci offered to reward Li Yongfang with promotion and special treatment if he surrendered Fushun reminding him of the grim fate that would await him and Fushun's residents if they continued to resist.<ref>Lovell (2007)</ref> Freeholder status was given to Li Yongfang's 1,000 troops after his surrender, and the later Chinese Bannermen (Hanjun, or Han Bannermen) Bao Chengxian and Shi Tingzhu also experience good fortune in Qing service after their surrenders in 1622 at Guangning.<ref name=\"Elliott 2001\" />\n\nNurhaci used semi-literate interlocutors of Han (Nikan) origin to translate between different languages and trusted them a lot, developing close and friendly personal relations with some of them like Kangg\u016bri and Fanggina. The Han Chinese Gong Zhenglu (Gong Zhengliu) who was abducted in the 1580s by the Jurchens from Liaodong with tens of thousands of others, originally came from [[Shaoxing]] in [[Zhejiang]] became a close confidant of Nurhaci and tutoring his sons, adopting the Manchu name Onoi, and being showered with wives, slaves, and a house by Nurhaci.<ref name=\"Crossley 1999\" />\n\nThe Manchu leader [[Nurhaci]] embarked on the conquest of [[Liaodong]] from the Ming dynasty, luring Han Chinese to his side to defect by threatening them with destruction and at the same time also promising them rewards, with important positions.<ref name=\"Spence 1990\">Spence (1990)</ref> A massive revolt against the Jurchens by the Liaodong Chinese broke out in 1623, due to the Jurchens squeezing the Chinese for labor and stationing Jurchen in Chinese households. Acts of sabotage and slaughter of the Jurchen were carried out by the Chinese rebels in retaliation.<ref name=\"Spence 1990\" /> [[Hong Taiji]], who succeeded Nurhaci, began to include many Chinese in his government and copy the Chinese style of governing.<ref name=\"Spence 1990\" /> After defeats inflicted by the Chinese General [[Yuan Chonghuan]] upon the Manchus with artillery such as at the [[Battle of Ningyuan]],<ref name=\"Wakeman 1977, p. 78\">Wakeman (1977) p. 78</ref> the Manchu then decided to absorb Han Chinese prisoners who knew how to use guns into their army to supplement their forces.<ref name=\"Wakeman 1977, p. 78\"/>\n\nThe Manchus also lured Han Chinese Generals into defecting and joining the Banners by marrying them to women from the Imperial [[Aisin Gioro]] family.<ref name=\"Walthall 2008, p. 148\">Walthall (2008) p. 148</ref> One Han Chinese General, Li Yongfang (Li Yung-fang) was bribed by the Manchus into defecting by being married to an Aisin Gioro wife, and being given a position in the banners. Many more Han Chinese abandoned their posts and joined the Manchus.<ref name=\"Wakeman 1977, p. 79\">Wakeman (1977) p. 79</ref> A mass marriage of Han Chinese to Manchu women numbering 1,000 took place in 1632 after Prince Yoto came up with the idea. They were either generals or officials.<ref name=\"Walthall 2008, p. 148\"/> It was said by the Manchu leader that \"since the Chinese generals and Manchu women lived together and ate together, it would help these surrendered generals to forget their motherland.\"<ref name=\"Walthall 2008, p. 148\"/> Women from the Imperial family were also married to other Han Chinese officials  like the [[Revolt of the Three Feudatories|Three Feudatories']] sons, who defected to the Qing after their conquest of China.<ref name=\"Walthall 2008, p. 148\"/> The Manchus also created an artillery unit out of Han Chinese, which they used against the Ming army.<ref name=\"Wakeman 1977, p. 79\"/> Han Chinese were also lured by the Manchus into defecting and entering their employ in civil service by granting them privileges such as calling themselves \"ministers\", while Manchus in the same position were regarded as \"slaves\".<ref>Wakeman (1977)</ref>\n\nThe Han who classified in different ways had come under Manchu rule in three different eras, before 1618 the Han \"transfrontiersmen\" who threw in their lot with Nurhaci were effectively only Han Chinese by ancestry and blood since they practiced Jurchen culture and became part of Manchu companies (Niru) within Manchu Banners, while from 1618-1622 the Han captured in Liaodong and Liaoxi became either bondservants to Manchu Banners or Han Bannermen, and then finally the Han who deserted the Ming during Hong Taiji's rule to join the Manchu, and these were first placed into separate all Han companies (Niru) attached to Manchu Banners, and then when in 1642 the Manchu Banners ejected all their Han companies they were placed into separate Chinese Banners (Hanjun, or Han Banners) since they were the mostly not assimilated to Jurchen culture.<ref name=\"Crossley Siu Sutton\">Crossley, Siu & Sutton (2006)</ref>\n\nAt Guangning, Shi Tingzhu, a Ming soldier of Jurchen descent but who practiced Chinese culture, had surrendered to Nurhaci's Later Jin in 1622 along with Bao Chengxian and they were eventually placed into Chinese Banners (Hanjun, or Han Banners), after Bao suggested creating separate Chinese Banners (Hanjun, or Han Banners). Neither were all Han Chinese in the Eight Banners part of the Chinese Banners (Hanjun, or Han Banners), nor was the Chinese Banners (Hanjun, or Han Banners) made out of only Han Chinese, Han Banner membership did not automatically mean they were actual Han Chinese.<ref name=\"Crossley Siu Sutton\" />\n\nThe Jurchens under Nurhaci had classified people as Han Chinese (Nikan) according to whether they were former Ming subjects, behaved like Han Chinese, had a Chinese lifestyle, spoke Chinese language, dressed like Han Chinese, and had Han Chinese names, and all Jurchens who had moved to Ming China adopted Chinese surnames.<ref name=\"Crossley Siu Sutton\" /> Chinese Bannermen (Hanjun, or Han Bannermen) rose to many powerful positions and prominence under Shunzhi, these Chinese Bannermen (Hanjun, or Han Bannermen) were descendants of Han defectors in Liaodong who joined Nurhaci and Hong Taiji, in the third or second generation.<ref name=\"Wakeman 1985\" /> They \"were barely distinguishable from Manchu nobility.\" Geng Zhongming, a Han bannerman, was awarded the title of Prince Jingnan, and his son Geng Jingmao managed to have both his sons Geng Jingzhong and Geng Zhaozhong become court attendants under Shunzhi and married Aisin Gioro women, with Haoge's (a son of Hong Taiji) daughter marrying Geng Jingzhong and Prince Abatai's granddaughter marrying Geng Zhaozhong.<ref name=\"Wakeman 1985\" />\n\nThe mistaken views applied to Chinese Bannermen (Hanjun, or Han Bannermen) about race and ethnicity missed the fact that they were actually a \"cultural group\" since a person could be a Chinese Bannermen (Hanjun, or Han Bannermen) without having to be an actual Han Chinese.<ref name=\"Hayter-Menzies 2008\">Hayter-Menzies (2008)</ref> It was Qianlong who redefined the identity of Han Bannermen by saying that they were to be regarded as of having the same culture and being of the same ancestral extraction as Han civilians, this replaced the earlier opposing ideology and stance used by Nurhaci and Hong Taiji who classified identity according to culture and politics only and not ancestry, but it was Qianlong's view on Chinese Bannermen (Hanjun, or Han Bannermen) identity which influenced the later historians and expunged the earlier Qing stance.<ref name=\"Crossley 1999, pp. 55-56\"/>\n\nQianlong also promulgated an entirely new view of the Han Bannermen different from his grandfather Kangxi, coming up with the abstract theory that loyalty in itself was what was regarded as the most important, so Qianlong viewed those Han Bannermen who had defected from the Ming to the Qing as traitors and compiled an unfavorable biography of the prominent Chinese Bannermen (Hanjun, or Han Bannermen)  who had defected to the Qing, while at the same time Qianlong had compiled a biography to glorify Ming loyalists who were martyred in battle against the Qing called \"Record of Those Martyred for Their Dynasty and Sacrificed for Purity\".<ref name=\"Crossley 1999\" /> Some of Qianlong's inclusions and omissions on the list were political in nature, like including Li Yongfang out of Qianlong's dislike for his descendant Li Shiyao and excluding Ma Mingpei out of concern for his son Ma Xiongzhen's image.<ref name=\"Crossley 1999\" />\n\nFrom 1618-1629, the Han Chinese from eastern Liaodong who joined the Eight Banners were known as \"tai nikan\", the Han who defected to the Qing at Fushun were known as Fushan Nikan and were considered part of the Tai Nikan.

The [[Manchu people]] founded the [[Qing dynasty]].\n\nThe Han Chinese banners were known as the \"Nikan\" Banners, made out of a massive number of Chinese POWs and defectors. [[Jurchen people|Jurchen]] women married most of these Chinese since they came with no family of their own.<ref name=\"Crossley, 2010, p. 95\">Kagan (2010) p. 95</ref> There were so many Han Chinese entering the Banners that there were more of them than the Jurchen.<ref name=\"Crossley, 2010, p. 95\"/> Attempts by [[Hung Taiji]] were made to separate Han Chinese and Jurchen banners. In Chinese and Jurchen of Liaodong were mixed in culture. Many bannermen forged genealogies of their origin since they did not have any, and then these decided whether or not they were in a Chinese or a Jurchen banner.<ref name=\"Crossley, 2010, p. 95\"/> The Eight Banners were then created from the old black Han Chinese banners and Jurchen banners and made equal to each other. The Mongol Eight banners were also created at this time, and anyone who was not classified into a Chinese or a Mongol banner became a Manchu, an ethnic group which Hung Taiji created.<ref name=\"Kagan 2010\">Kagan (2010)</ref>\n\nManchu bannermen and Han bannermen were not categorized according to blood or ancestry or genealogy; they were categorized by their language, culture, behavior, identification and way of life. Many Chinese bannermen (Hanjun, or Han Bannermen) were descended from Sinicized Jurchen who spoke Chinese and served the Ming, while some ethnic Manchu Bannermen (Baqi Manzhou) were of ethnic Han origins who had defected to the Jurchens, assimilated into Jurchen language and culture and lived among them in Jilin before 1618.\n\nThe Qing regarded Chinese Bannermen (Hanjun, or Han Bannermen) and the non Bannerman Han civilian general population (Han min, Han ren, minren) as separate. People were grouped into Manchu Banners and Chinese Banners (Hanjun, or Han Bannermen)  not based on their ancestry, race or blood, but based on their culture and the language they spoke. Han who deserted the Ming and who had moved to Nurgan (Jilin) as transfrontiersmen before 1618 assimilated with the Jurchen, practiced Jurchen culture and spoke Jurchen became part of the ethnic Manchu Banners, while descendants of sinicized Jurchen who had moved to Liaodong, adopted Han culture and surname, and swore loyalty to the Ming and spoke Chinese, eventually became part of the Chinese Banners (Hanjun, or Han Bannermen)  after being conquered by Nurhaci after 1618.\n\nHan who actively defected to the Jurchen in Nurgan before 1618 were called \"transfrontiersman\" since they crossed the frontier over into Jurchen territory and adopted Jurchen identity and later became part of the Manchu Banners, while Han in Ming ruled Liaodong who only defected after the Qing conquered Liaoding were called \"frontiersman\" since they only lived on the frontier of Ming territory and they were put into the Chinese Banners (Hanjun, or Han Bannermen) .\n\nHan Chinese defectors who fled from the Ming joined the Jurchens in Nurgan before 1618 were placed into Manchu Banners and regarded as Manchu, but the Ming residents of Liaodong who were incorporated into the Eight Banners after the conquest of Liaodong from the Ming from 1618-1643 were placed into the separate Chinese Banners (Chinese:Hanjun, Manchu: Nikan cooha or Ujen cooha), and many of these Chinese Bannermen (Hanjun, or Han Bannermen) from Liaodong had Jurchen ancestry and were not classified as Manchu by the Qing.<ref name=\"Crossley 1999\">Crossley (1999)</ref> Geography, culture, language, occupation and lifestyle were the factors used by Nurhaci's Jianzhou Jurchen Khanate to classify people as Jurchen or Nikan, those who were considered Jurchen lived in a Jurchen lifestyle, used the Jurchen language and inhabited the eastern part were considered Jurchen, while those who were considered by Nurhaci as Nikan (Han Chinese) even though some of these Nikan were of Korean or Jurchen ancestry, were the ones who used Chinese language, and inhabited villages and towns on the west.<ref name=\"Crossley 1999\" />\n\nPeople from both sides often moved over the cultural and territorial division between the Ming Liaodong and Jurchen Nurgan; Han Chinese soldiers and peasants moved into Nurgan while Jurchen mercenaries and merchants moved to Liaodong, with some lineages ended up being dispersed on both sides, and the Jurchen viewed people as Nikan depending on whether they acted like Han Chinese. People from the same lineage like the Sinicized Jurchen Tong lineage of Fushun in Liaodong served both Ming and the Qing, with some like Tong Bunian staying as diehard Ming loyalists and others having faithfully serving the Qing conquest, after Liaodong was conquered and the Tong were enrolled in the Han Plain Blue Banner by the Qing. Eventually, the Kangxi Emperor even transferred some members of the Tong lineage like Tong Guogang and a few of his close relatives to the Manchu Bordered Yellow Banner after Tong requested the transfer.<ref name=\"Crossley 1999, pp. 55-56\">Crossley (1999) pp. 55-56</ref><ref name=\"Rawski 1998\">Rawski (1998)</ref><ref>Rowe (2010)</ref><ref name=\"University of California Press\">Watson & Ebrey (1991)</ref>\n\nTong Guogang justified his asking for transfer to a Manchu Banner was because the Tong were of Jurchen origin, but only Tong Guogang's immediate family and company were transferred to the Manchu but the other Tong companies were left as Chinese. It was Qing policy to for every closely related in-law of the emperor to get transferred into a Manchu Banner even if they were from another ethnicity and this was the most probable reason why Tong's request was granted by Kangxi, and more like than his appeal to his Jurchen origin.<ref name=\"Elliott 2001\">Elliott (2001)</ref> The beginning of the Qing showed flexibility and political expedience was used when determining ethnicity, both regarding Tong's transfer from a Han to a Manchu Banner and Han Chinese who assimilated to the Jurchens.<ref name=\"Elliott 2001\" />\n\nThe geographical, political, and cultural division was between the Ming Liaodong and the Jurchen dominated Nurgan, which traded and interacted with Liaodong through Fushun.<ref name=\"Crossley 1999\" />\n\nNurhaci and Hongtaiji both viewed ethnic identity as determined by culture, language, and attitude, not by ancestry (genealogy), and these identities could be changed and people transferred from different ethnic banners to another. Mongols were associated with the Mongolian language, nomadism and horse related activities, Manchus were associated with Manchu language and foremost being part of the Banners, and Han Chinese were associated with inhabiting Liaodong, the Chinese language, agriculture, commerce.<ref name=\"Kagan 2010\" /> Biological determinants and ancestry were disregarded in determining Manchu and Han identities, culture was the primary factor in differentiating between Manchu and Han, and occasionally identities were blurred and could be altered.<ref>Hammond & Stapleton (2008)</ref> The Qing creation of the separate Manchu, Mongol, and Han Banners was not rooted in distinguishable classifications of people, but of fluxing categories defined by the Qing, their membership in the different banners primarily depending on whether they spoke the Manchu, Mongolian, or the Chinese language.<ref name=\"Naquin 2000, p. 371\">Naquin (2000) p. 371</ref> It has been suggested that the Chinese Bannermen (Hanjun, or Han Bannermen) themselves were not very familiar with the exact meaning of \"Hanjun\", as the Qing changed the definition of what it meant to be a Manchu or a Han Bannerman.<ref name=\"Naquin 2000, p. 371\"/>\n\nThe Manchu official [[Duanfang]] had Han Chinese ancestors originating from Zhejiang- towards the end of the Ming, they had defected to the Qing and moved to southern Manchuria from their original home in [[Zhejiang]] province, they changed their surname to Tohoro from Tao to make it sound Manchu and registered it in the Manchu Plain White Banner.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=tgq1miGno-4C&pg=PA55&dq=tao+tohoro+han#v=onepage&q=tao+tohoro+han&f=false|title=Lessons in Being Chinese: Minority Education and Ethnic Identity in Southwest China|first=Mette Halskov|last=Hansen|date=1 October 2011|publisher=University of Washington Press|via=Google Books|isbn=9780295804125}}</ref><ref name=\"Taveirne 2004\">Taveirne (2004)</ref> Since the Manchus were willing to accept assimilated strangers, Han Chinese who defected to the Jurchens or were captured by them had integrated well into Manchu society.<ref name=\"Wakeman 1985\">Wakeman (1985)</ref> These Han Chinese transfrontiersman from Liaodong embraced Manchu customs and changed their names into Manchu to the point where<ref name=\"Wakeman 1985\" /> they identified as Manchu rather than Chinese and resembles Manchus in their speech, behavior, and looks.<ref name=\"Wakeman 1985\" /> It is hard for historians to tell whether a Manchu was originally a Han transfrontiersman since they no longer used Chinese names or regarded themselves as Han Chinese, [[Frederic Wakeman]] suggested that is evidence that the Manchu Dahai's ancestors were Han Chinese transfrontiersman.<ref name=\"Wakeman 1985\" /> The Jurchen headman of Turun-hoton and arch-enemy of Nurhaci, Nikan Wailan, was also suggested to be a Han transfrontiersman by Wakeman, since his name literally meant \"Chinese official\".<ref name=\"Crossley 1999\" />\n\nThe Manchu word for Han, \"Nikan\" was used to describe people who lived like Han Chinese and not their actual ethnic origin, the Han Bannermen (Hanjun) was not an ethnic category and the Han Banners included people of non-Han Chinese blood.<ref name=\"Rawski 1998\" /> When Liaodong was invaded in 1619 by Nurhaci, it became imperative for the Jurchens to secure the loyalty of the Han (Nikan) in Liaodong to their cause, by treating them equally as Jurchens were treated and even seizing Jurchen properties, grains, wealth, possessions and homes to grant them to Han, and having the aristocracy expand to include Han families in order to get Han to defect to Nurhaci's side.<ref name=\"Crossley 1999\" />\n\nSome Han Bannermen and their lineages became successful members of the Qing nobility and their descendants continued to be awarded noble titles, like that of Li Yongfang who was ennobled by Nurhaci as third class viscount and enrolled in the Plain Blue Chinese Banner (Hanjun, or Han Banner), and his descendants continued to be nobles to the final years of Qianlong's rule and were ennobled with even greater titles.<ref name=\"Rawski 1998\" /> The Manchus gave extensive titles and honors and marriage to Aisin Gioro women to pre-1644 Han defectors, like the marriage of Nurhaci's granddaughter to Li Yongfang and his sons registered in the Chinese Plain Blue banner (Hanjun, or Han Banner), and the title granted to the son of a Ming defector, Sun Sike (Sun Ssu-k'o) in the Chinese Plain White Banner, (Hanjun, or Han Banner) and the marriage of one of Kangxi's daughters to his son.<ref name=\"University of California Press\" />\n\nAt the beginning of the Qing, originally the sharpest distinction was drawn by Qing policy to emphasize difference between Han civilians and all Bannermen, and not between Chinese Bannermen (Hanjun, or Han Bannermen) and Manchu Bannermen. The Manchus used Nikan to describe Ming subjects in Liaodong who lived a Chinese lifestyle like sinicized Jurchens, Mongols, and Koreans, and not as a racial term for ethnic Han Chinese. A person only had to be originally a Ming subject and not ethnic Chinese to get categorized as a Han bannerman so people of Jurchen origin ended up in Mongol and Chinese Banners.<ref name=\"University of California Press\"/> Nurhaci used culture to categorize people and allowed Han transfrontiersmen to identify as Manchu after assimilating, and ethnicity was regarded as flexible when Han Chinese and Mongols families were moved by Kangxi to Manchu Banners from their original Mongol and Chinese Banners (Hanjun, or Han Banners) .<ref name=\"University of California Press\" />\n\nLi Yongfang's rewards for surrendering Fushun to the Jurchens and defecting included promotion in rank, Nurhaci's granddaughter as a wife, battling along with Nurhaci and induction into the Jin aristocracy as a Chinese frontiersman, which was different from how Nurhaci handled both the Han transfrontiersmen who assimilated into Manchu identity and captured Han bondservants.<ref name=\"Wakeman 1985\" /> The Chinese frontiersman were inducted into the Han Banners.<ref name=\"Taveirne 2004\" /> Nurhaci offered to reward Li Yongfang with promotion and special treatment if he surrendered Fushun reminding him of the grim fate that would await him and Fushun's residents if they continued to resist.<ref>Lovell (2007)</ref> Freeholder status was given to Li Yongfang's 1,000 troops after his surrender, and the later Chinese Bannermen (Hanjun, or Han Bannermen) Bao Chengxian and Shi Tingzhu also experience good fortune in Qing service after their surrenders in 1622 at Guangning.<ref name=\"Elliott 2001\" />\n\nNurhaci used semi-literate interlocutors of Han (Nikan) origin to translate between different languages and trusted them a lot, developing close and friendly personal relations with some of them like Kangg\u016bri and Fanggina. The Han Chinese Gong Zhenglu (Gong Zhengliu) who was abducted in the 1580s by the Jurchens from Liaodong with tens of thousands of others, originally came from [[Shaoxing]] in [[Zhejiang]] became a close confidant of Nurhaci and tutoring his sons, adopting the Manchu name Onoi, and being showered with wives, slaves, and a house by Nurhaci.<ref name=\"Crossley 1999\" />\n\nThe Manchu leader [[Nurhaci]] embarked on the conquest of [[Liaodong]] from the Ming dynasty, luring Han Chinese to his side to defect by threatening them with destruction and at the same time also promising them rewards, with important positions.<ref name=\"Spence 1990\">Spence (1990)</ref> A massive revolt against the Jurchens by the Liaodong Chinese broke out in 1623, due to the Jurchens squeezing the Chinese for labor and stationing Jurchen in Chinese households.

Neither were all Han Chinese in the Eight Banners part of the Chinese Banners (Hanjun, or Han Banners), nor was the Chinese Banners (Hanjun, or Han Banners) made out of only Han Chinese, Han Banner membership did not automatically mean they were actual Han Chinese.<ref name=\"Crossley Siu Sutton\" />\n\nThe Jurchens under Nurhaci had classified people as Han Chinese (Nikan) according to whether they were former Ming subjects, behaved like Han Chinese, had a Chinese lifestyle, spoke Chinese language, dressed like Han Chinese, and had Han Chinese names, and all Jurchens who had moved to Ming China adopted Chinese surnames.<ref name=\"Crossley Siu Sutton\" /> Chinese Bannermen (Hanjun, or Han Bannermen) rose to many powerful positions and prominence under Shunzhi, these Chinese Bannermen (Hanjun, or Han Bannermen) were descendants of Han defectors in Liaodong who joined Nurhaci and Hong Taiji, in the third or second generation.<ref name=\"Wakeman 1985\" /> They \"were barely distinguishable from Manchu nobility.\" Geng Zhongming, a Han bannerman, was awarded the title of Prince Jingnan, and his son Geng Jingmao managed to have both his sons Geng Jingzhong and Geng Zhaozhong become court attendants under Shunzhi and get married to Aisin Gioro women, with Haoge's (a son of Hong Taiji) daughter marrying Geng Jingzhong and Prince Abatai's granddaughter marrying Geng Zhaozhong.<ref name=\"Wakeman 1985\" />\n\nThe mistaken views applied to Chinese Bannermen (Hanjun, or Han Bannermen) about race and ethnicity missed the fact that they were actually a \"cultural group\" since a person could be a Chinese Bannermen (Hanjun, or Han Bannermen) without having to be an actual Han Chinese.<ref name=\"Hayter-Menzies 2008\">Hayter-Menzies (2008)</ref> It was Qianlong who redefined the identity of Han Bannermen by saying that they were to be regarded as of having the same culture and being of the same ancestral extraction as Han civilians, this replaced the earlier opposing ideology and stance used by Nurhaci and Hong Taiji who classified identity according to culture and politics only and not ancestry, but it was Qianlong's view on Chinese Bannermen (Hanjun, or Han Bannermen) identity which influenced the later historians and expunged the earlier Qing stance.<ref name=\"Crossley 1999, pp. 55-56\"/>\n\nQianlong also promulgated an entirely new view of the Han Bannermen different from his grandfather Kangxi, coming up with the abstract theory that loyalty in itself was what was regarded as the most important, so Qianlong viewed those Han Bannermen who had defected from the Ming to the Qing as traitors and compiled an unfavorable biography of the prominent Chinese Bannermen (Hanjun, or Han Bannermen)  who had defected to the Qing, while at the same time Qianlong had compiled a biography to glorify Ming loyalists who were martyred in battle against the Qing called \"Record of Those Martyred for Their Dynasty and Sacrificed for Purity\".<ref name=\"Crossley 1999\" /> Some of Qianlong's inclusions and omissions on the list were political in nature, like including Li Yongfang out of Qianlong's dislike for his descendant Li Shiyao and excluding Ma Mingpei out of concern for his son Ma Xiongzhen's image.<ref name=\"Crossley 1999\" />\n\nFrom 1618-1629, the Han Chinese from eastern Liaodong who joined the Eight Banners were known as \"tai nikan\", the Han who defected to the Qing at Fushun were known as Fushan Nikan and were considered part of the Tai Nikan. The Tai Nikan were distinguished from the later Han Chinese who joined the banners between 1629-1643 and originated from western Liaodong, Shanxi, Shandong, and Zhili, and were known as \"fu xi baitangga\".<ref name=\"Crossley 1999\" /> Both groups were part of the Chinese Banners before the Qing crossed over Shanhai pass in 1644, and as such were both distinguished from Han who were incorporated into the Chinese Banners after 1644 when the Qing ruled China.

The increasing presence of Mandarin-speakers in the territory since 1997, and expectations of mainland Chinese for Hong Kong residents to speak Mandarin, has caused conflicts and defensive measures by citizens to [[Language preservation|protect]] Cantonese against the encroachment of Mandarin.<ref>[http://www.scmp.com/news/china-insider/article/1331396/city-university-students-deny-teacher-took-class-mandarin City University students deny teacher took class in Mandarin] Luo, Chris, ''[[South China Morning Post]]'', 14 October 2013.</ref>  Such actions include stigmatizing Mandarin as a language of [[communism]], while [[Cantonese]] is perceived as a language of democracy; reflecting the political differences between Hong Kong and China. This [[Language politics|political linguistic]] view has also spread among [[Overseas Chinese]] communities, the majority of which are historically Cantonese-speaking.<ref>[http://chinadailymail.com/2014/07/10/china-hong-kong-and-cantonese-dialect-dialectic/ China, Hong Kong and Cantonese: Dialect dialectric] China Daily Mail, 10 July 2014</ref>\n\nThe lack of [[democratic development in Hong Kong]] has further eroded a sense of a Chinese identity.<ref>[http://thediplomat.com/2014/10/think-228-not-tiananmen-how-identity-drives-the-hong-kong-protests/ Think 228, Not Tiananmen: How Identity Drives the Hong Kong] Vien, Thomas, ''The Diplomat'', 22 October 2014.</ref> Under the [[one country, two systems]] policy agreed between the United Kingdom and China as a condition of Hong Kong's return, the territory is guaranteed the right to retain its free way of life for at least 50 years after 1997. However, increasing attempts from the Beijing government to curb [[democratic institution]]s and [[Censorship in Hong Kong|free speech]], including the delay of eventual universal suffrage, have drawn continual protests and unrest among locals. This cumulated in the [[2014 Hong Kong protests]], when the [[Chinese Communist Party]] allowed Hong Kongers to vote for the territory's chief executive under the condition that Beijing first approves of the running candidates. The political crises have led to a strengthening of a local Hong Kong identity, with an [[Hong Kong Independence Movement|independence movement]] beginning to take form as a result.\n\n===Taiwan===\n{{See also|Taiwanization}}\nFollowing the [[Taiwan Retrocession Day|retrocession]] of Taiwan to the [[Republic of China (1912-1949)|Republic of China]] in 1945, the [[Kuomintang]]-led government promoted a \"resinicization\" of the island's population,<ref name=\"Diamond\">{{cite book |title=Consolidating the Third Wave Democracies: Regional Challenges |first=Larry |last=Diamond |first2=Marc |last2=Plattner |first3=Yun-han |last3=Chu |first4=Hung-mao |last4=Tien |publisher=JHU Press |year=1997 |page=293 |quote=[During] extended Japanese colonial rule (1895-1945)... the native elite was subordinated first to a state-orchestrated desinicization campaign and later a Japanization movement that proceeded in earnest during the Pacific war.... the state's [subsequent] effort to establish the supremacy of Chinese identity... through resinicization and Mandarinization programs [occurred] despite many shared ethnic heritages between the native and the newly arrived emigre group.}}</ref><ref name=\"Sharma\">{{cite book |title=Taiwan Today |first=Anita |last=Sharma |first2=Sreemati |last2=Chakrabarti |publisher=Anthem Press |year=2010 |pages=21\u201322 |quote=[T]he people of Taiwan have been enmeshed in a century long struggle with state-sponsored cultural programmes, from 'desinicization' at the early stage of colonial rule, to 'Japanization' at the subsequent stage, and to 'resinicization' under the KMT rule.}}</ref> sponsoring [[Chinese calligraphy]], [[Chinese painting|traditional Chinese painting]], [[Chinese folk art|folk art]], and [[Chinese opera]].\n\nDe-Sinicization occurred most rapidly between 1992 and 2005, according to a survey by the [[National Chengchi University]] about national identity in Taiwan.

However, the [[Lee Tenghui]] administration (1988\u20132000) began to desinicize the polity by abolishing this Assembly in 1991, to form a parliamentary body with a Taiwan-only electorate.<ref name=\"Hao\"/> In academia, De-Sinicization in the late 1980s and 1990s resulted in the replacement of the word \"China\" in the names of institutions to \"Taiwan\", creating the \"Taiwan Legal Association\", \"Taiwan Political Science Association\", \"Taiwan Sociological Association\", and \"Taiwan History Association\". As part of this movement, some Taiwanese historians downplayed the abuses of [[Japanese occupation of Taiwan|Japan's colonial administration]], referring to it as \"rule\" rather than \"occupation\"; and the Taiwan History Association claimed that Taiwan's history was a part of Japanese, rather than Chinese, history.<ref name=\"Hao\"/>\n\nIn 2001, proponents of [[Taiwanization]] began characterizing De-Sinicization 2001 as a part of the movement to emphasize a local Taiwan-based identity in opposition to the political leadership that had historically identified with China and Chinese culture.<ref>{{cite book |title=Lost Soul: \"Confucianism\" in contemporary Chinese academic discourse |first=John |last=Makeham |publisher=Harvard University Asia Center |year=2008 |page=85 |quote=Many proponents of indigenization in Taiwan regard it quite specifically as a project of De-Sinicization: an attempt to remove the yoke of \"Chinese\" colonial hegemony so that Taiwan's putative native (bentu) identity can be recognized and further nurtured.}}</ref>\n\nDe-Sinicization accelerated under the [[Chen Shui-bian]] administration (2000\u20132008), with the pro-[[Taiwan independence]] [[Democratic Progressive Party]] in control of the [[Executive Yuan]]. Chen's Minister of Education, [[Tu Cheng-sheng]], directed the rewriting of high school history textbooks to abolish the \"remnants of greater Chinese consciousness\" ({{lang|zh|\u5927\u4e2d\u570b\u610f\u8b58\u7684\u6c88\u75fe}}). This textbook De-Sinicization included the separation of Taiwanese history and Chinese history into separate volumes, a ban on the term ''[[mainland China]]'', and the portrayal of Chinese immigration to Taiwan during the [[Qing Dynasty]] as \"[[colonization]]\".\n\nConcurrently, Chen introduced the [[One Country on Each Side]] concept in 2002, which posited that China and Taiwan are separate countries, while ordering the addition of the words \"Issued in Taiwan\" on [[Republic of China passport]]s.<ref name=\"Hao\" /> That same year, Tu's department chose to invent its own romanization system for Mandarin Chinese, [[Tongyong Pinyin]], designed by a Taiwanese scholar rather than adopting the internationally well-known [[Hanyu Pinyin]] system developed by the People's Republic of China and used in other countries such as [[Singapore]] and [[Malaysia]]. In 2003, the government abolished the longstanding policy of using Mandarin as the sole language of government, which in practice promoted the second-largest language on the island, [[Taiwanese Hokkien]], to fulfill many of the functions of a [[national language]].<ref name=\"Hao\" />  From 2004, the map of the \"Republic of China\" no longer includes mainland China.\n\nFrom 2005, Chen's [[Executive Yuan]] also initiated the [[Taiwan Name Rectification Campaign]], which sought to remove the words \"China\" or \"Chinese\" from public and private organizations. This included the renaming of state bodies such as the \"Overseas Chinese Affairs Council\" (which became the \"[[Overseas Community Affairs Council]]\"), persuading private organizations like [[China Airlines]] to change their name, and also the purging of references to mainland China in nearly 100 administrative laws. In 2006, Chen abolished the [[National Unification Council]] and its Guidelines for National Unification.<ref name=\"Hao\" /> In February 2007, Chen's government changed the name of [[Chunghwa Post]] (China Post) to Taiwan Post, Chinese Petroleum Company to \"[[CPC Corporation, Taiwan]], and China Shipbuilding Corporation to \"[[CSBC Corporation, Taiwan]]\".<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.post.gov.tw/post/internet/u_english/index.jsp?ID=21 |title=\uff1a\uff1a\uff1a\uff1a\uff1aWelcome to Taiwan POST\uff1a\uff1a\uff1a\uff1a\uff1a |accessdate=5 January 2011 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070510014519/http://www.post.gov.tw/post/internet/u_english/index.jsp?ID=21 |archivedate=10 May 2007 }}</ref>\n\nThe name changing issue was a topic in the Republic of China presidential elections in Taiwan in March 2008.

Favorable conditions allowed Irma to [[Rapid intensification|rapidly intensify]] into a [[Category&nbsp;3 hurricane]] on the [[Saffir\u2013Simpson wind scale]] by late on August&nbsp;31. However, the storm's intensity fluctuated between Categories&nbsp;2 and 3 for the next several days, due to a series of [[eyewall replacement cycle]]s. On September 4, Irma resumed intensifying, becoming a Category&nbsp;5 hurricane by early on the next day. Early on September 6, Irma peaked with 1-minute sustained winds of 180&nbsp;mph (285&nbsp;km/h) and a minimum [[atmospheric pressure|pressure]] of {{convert|914|hPa|inHg|abbr=on}}. Irma was the second-most intense tropical cyclone worldwide in 2017 in terms of barometric pressure, and the strongest worldwide in 2017 in terms of wind speed. Another eyewall replacement cycle caused Irma to weaken back to a Category&nbsp;4 hurricane, but the storm re-attained Category&nbsp;5 status before making landfall in [[Cuba]]. Although Irma briefly weakened to a Category&nbsp;2 storm while making landfall on Cuba, the system re-intensified to Category&nbsp;4 status as it crossed the warm waters of the [[Straits of Florida]], before making landfall on [[Cudjoe Key, Florida|Cudjoe Key]] on September&nbsp;10. Irma then weakened to Category&nbsp;3 status, prior to another landfall in Florida on [[Marco Island, Florida|Marco Island]] later that day. The system degraded into a remnant low over [[Alabama]] and ultimately dissipated on September&nbsp;13 over [[Missouri]].\n\nThe storm caused catastrophic damage in [[Barbuda]], [[Saint Barth\u00e9lemy]], [[Saint Martin]], [[Anguilla]], and the [[Virgin Islands]] as a Category&nbsp;5 hurricane. The hurricane caused at least 134 deaths: one in [[Anguilla]]; one in [[Barbados]]; three in [[Barbuda]]; four in the [[British Virgin Islands]]; 10 in [[Cuba]]; 11 in the [[French West Indies]]; one in [[Haiti]]; three in [[Puerto Rico]]; four on the Dutch side of [[Sint Maarten]]; 92 in the [[contiguous United States]], and four in the [[United States Virgin Islands|U.S. Virgin Islands]].

As it continued approaching the Leeward Islands, Irma underwent a second and more robust period of rapid intensification, becoming a Category&nbsp;5 hurricane by 12:00&nbsp;UTC on the following day, with winds of 175&nbsp;mph (280&nbsp;km/h). The extremely powerful hurricane continued to intensify, with maximum sustained winds peaking at 180&nbsp;mph (285&nbsp;km/h) near 18:00&nbsp;UTC on September 5. Irma continued to intensify while approaching the northern [[Leeward Islands]]. Almost eight hours later, around 05:45 UTC on September 6, Irma made landfall along the northern coast of [[Barbuda]] at peak intensity, with the storm's central minimum pressure having bottomed out at {{convert|914|mbar|inHg|abbr=on}} \u2013 this was the lowest in the Atlantic since [[Hurricane Dean|Dean]] in 2007; the storm also made landfall with maximum sustained winds of 180&nbsp;mph (285&nbsp;km/h). Irma continued to maintain its peak intensity until 12:00 UTC on September 6 and made additional successive landfalls on that same day, at 11:15&nbsp;UTC on [[Sint Maarten]], and at 16:30&nbsp;UTC on [[Virgin Gorda]], in the [[British Virgin Islands]], though the storm's central pressure had risen slightly prior to its third landfall.<ref name=\"TCR\"/>\n\n[[File:Irma, Jose and Katia 2017-09-07.png|thumb|left|upright=1.25|Three simultaneously active hurricanes on September&nbsp;7.

Late on September&nbsp;6, the cyclone passed about {{convert|60|mi|km|abbr=on}} north of [[Puerto Rico]]. Moving west-northwestward, Irma closely paralleled the north coast of [[Hispaniola]] throughout the day on September&nbsp;7. After beginning an [[eyewall replacement cycle]], Irma weakened to a Category&nbsp;4 hurricane as it passed south of the [[Turks and Caicos Islands]] early on September&nbsp;8. This subsequently ended the 60-hour contiguous period of Irma maintaining Category&nbsp;5 intensity, the second longest any Atlantic storm had maintained winds above {{convert|156|mph|km/h|abbr=on}} \u2013 behind only the [[1932 Cuba hurricane]]. At 05:00&nbsp;UTC on September&nbsp;8, Irma made landfall on the island of [[Little Inagua]] in the Bahamas with sustained winds of 155&nbsp;mph (250&nbsp;km/h). The hurricane then began tracking more to the west due to the intensification of a [[ridge (meteorology)|subtropical ridge]] to its north. Once the eyewall replacement cycle was complete, Irma began to re-intensify, and it re-attained Category&nbsp;5 intensity at 18:00&nbsp;UTC that day east of [[Cuba]] as deep convection became more pronounced and organized. The hurricane then made landfall in [[Cayo Romano|Cayo Romano, Cuba]], at 03:00&nbsp;UTC on September 9, with winds of 165&nbsp;mph (270&nbsp;km/h). This made Irma only the second Category&nbsp;5 hurricane to strike Cuba in recorded history, after the [[1924 Cuba hurricane]]. As the eye of Irma moved along the northern coast of Cuba, gradual weakening ensued due to land interaction, with the eye becoming cloud-filled and the intensity falling to a high-end Category&nbsp;2 storm later on September 9.<ref name=\"TCR\"/>\n\n[[File:Irma & Andrew comparison.jpg|thumb|Combined satellite image of Hurricanes [[Hurricane Andrew|Andrew]] and Irma, showing the size comparison of the storms]]\nAfter slowing down late on September 9, the hurricane turned northwestward towards [[Florida]] around the southwestern edge of the subtropical high to its northeast and a low-pressure system that was located over the continental [[United States]].

Once Irma had moved inland, it began to accelerate to the north-northwest, while rapid weakening began to occur due to the increasing wind shear, land interaction, and dry air, with the storm falling below Category&nbsp;3 intensity hours after landfall. Passing east of [[Tampa, Florida|Tampa]] as a weakening Category&nbsp;1 hurricane around 06:00&nbsp;UTC on September 11, Irma continued to weaken as most of the deep convection became more spread out towards the northern semi-circle of the circulation \u2013 though it retained a large wind field, with most of Florida experiencing gale-force winds.

As it continued approaching the Leeward Islands, Irma underwent a second and more robust period of rapid intensification, becoming a Category&nbsp;5 hurricane by 12:00&nbsp;UTC on the following day, with winds of 175&nbsp;mph (280&nbsp;km/h). The extremely powerful hurricane continued to intensify, with maximum sustained winds peaking at 180&nbsp;mph (285&nbsp;km/h) near 18:00&nbsp;UTC on September 5. Irma continued to intensify while approaching the northern [[Leeward Islands]]. Almost eight hours later, around 05:45 UTC on September 6, Irma made landfall along the northern coast of [[Barbuda]] at peak intensity, with the storm's central minimum pressure having bottomed out at {{convert|914|mbar|inHg|abbr=on}} \u2013 this was the lowest in the Atlantic since [[Hurricane Dean|Dean]] in 2007; the storm also made landfall with maximum sustained winds of 180&nbsp;mph (285&nbsp;km/h). Irma continued to maintain its peak intensity until 12:00 UTC on September 6 and made additional successive landfalls on that same day, at 11:15&nbsp;UTC on [[Sint Maarten]], and at 16:30&nbsp;UTC on [[Virgin Gorda]], in the [[British Virgin Islands]], though the storm's central pressure had risen slightly prior to its third landfall.<ref name=\"TCR\"/>\n\n[[File:Irma, Jose and Katia 2017-09-07.png|thumb|left|upright=1.25|Three simultaneously active hurricanes on September&nbsp;7. From left to right: [[Hurricane Katia (2017)|Katia]], Irma, and [[Hurricane Jose (2017)|Jose]], the first occurrence since [[2010 Atlantic hurricane season|2010]].]]\nAs the hurricane moved away from the [[Virgin Islands]] late on September&nbsp;6, observations from reconnaissance flights, as well as Doppler radar in [[San Juan, Puerto Rico]], indicated an elliptical eye and double eyewalls. Late on September&nbsp;6, the cyclone passed about {{convert|60|mi|km|abbr=on}} north of [[Puerto Rico]]. Moving west-northwestward, Irma closely paralleled the north coast of [[Hispaniola]] throughout the day on September&nbsp;7. After beginning an [[eyewall replacement cycle]], Irma weakened to a Category&nbsp;4 hurricane as it passed south of the [[Turks and Caicos Islands]] early on September&nbsp;8. This subsequently ended the 60-hour contiguous period of Irma maintaining Category&nbsp;5 intensity, the second longest any Atlantic storm had maintained winds above {{convert|156|mph|km/h|abbr=on}} \u2013 behind only the [[1932 Cuba hurricane]]. At 05:00&nbsp;UTC on September&nbsp;8, Irma made landfall on the island of [[Little Inagua]] in the Bahamas with sustained winds of 155&nbsp;mph (250&nbsp;km/h). The hurricane then began tracking more to the west due to the intensification of a [[ridge (meteorology)|subtropical ridge]] to its north. Once the eyewall replacement cycle was complete, Irma began to re-intensify, and it re-attained Category&nbsp;5 intensity at 18:00&nbsp;UTC that day east of [[Cuba]] as deep convection became more pronounced and organized. The hurricane then made landfall in [[Cayo Romano|Cayo Romano, Cuba]], at 03:00&nbsp;UTC on September 9, with winds of 165&nbsp;mph (270&nbsp;km/h). This made Irma only the second Category&nbsp;5 hurricane to strike Cuba in recorded history, after the [[1924 Cuba hurricane]]. As the eye of Irma moved along the northern coast of Cuba, gradual weakening ensued due to land interaction, with the eye becoming cloud-filled and the intensity falling to a high-end Category&nbsp;2 storm later on September 9.<ref name=\"TCR\"/>\n\n[[File:Irma & Andrew comparison.jpg|thumb|Combined satellite image of Hurricanes [[Hurricane Andrew|Andrew]] and Irma, showing the size comparison of the storms]]\nAfter slowing down late on September 9, the hurricane turned northwestward towards [[Florida]] around the southwestern edge of the subtropical high to its northeast and a low-pressure system that was located over the continental [[United States]]. Moving over the warm waters of the Straits of Florida, Irma quickly restrengthened to a Category&nbsp;4 hurricane at 06:00&nbsp;UTC on September 10, as deep convection improved and the eye becoming better defined.<ref name=\"TCR\"/> In addition, Irma's wind field continued to increase in size, with hurricane-force winds spanning out a region of {{convert|80|mi|km|abbr=on}} and gale-force winds spanning {{convert|220|mi|km|abbr=on}} in diameter.<ref>{{cite web|author=Jack L.

Increasing wind shear and land interaction caused the satellite appearance of the storm to become ragged later that day, and Irma weakened to Category&nbsp;3 intensity before making its seventh and final landfall at 19:30&nbsp;UTC, in [[Marco Island, Florida]], with sustained winds of 115&nbsp;mph (185&nbsp;km/h). Once Irma had moved inland, it began to accelerate to the north-northwest, while rapid weakening began to occur due to the increasing wind shear, land interaction, and dry air, with the storm falling below Category&nbsp;3 intensity hours after landfall. Passing east of [[Tampa, Florida|Tampa]] as a weakening Category&nbsp;1 hurricane around 06:00&nbsp;UTC on September 11, Irma continued to weaken as most of the deep convection became more spread out towards the northern semi-circle of the circulation \u2013 though it retained a large wind field, with most of Florida experiencing gale-force winds.
