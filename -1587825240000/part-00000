The game centers around the manipulation of \"rules\"\u2014represented by tiles with words written on them\u2014in order to allow the [[player character]], usually the titular Baba, to reach a specified goal.\n\n== Gameplay ==\n[[File:Baba is you gameplay.gif|thumb|left|The three blocks reading \"WALL IS STOP\" create a rule that prevents Baba (the white [[rabbit]], made the [[player character]] by the phrase \"BABA IS YOU\") from crossing wall tiles. Once the rule blocks are separated, the rule is no longer enforced, and Baba can pass through walls.|alt=A white rabbit, named Baba, is enclosed in all directions by walls. Outside of this enclosure is the phrase \"BABA IS YOU\", and inside the enclosure is the phrase \"WALL IS STOP\". Baba moves around, and attempts to walk past a wall, but fails. Then, Baba breaks the \"WALL IS STOP\" phrase, and is able to walk past it.]]\nThe player, usually, controls a character known as Baba, with exceptions in some levels. Each level contains various movable word tiles, corresponding to specific types of objects and obstacles on the field (such as Baba itself, the goal flag, walls and environmental hazards, and other creatures), linking [[Operator (computer programming)|operators]] such as \"is\" and \"and\", and verb tiles reflecting the properties of these objects (such as \"you\", which makes the object become controlled by the player, \"push\" to make them movable, \"stop\" to make them impassable, \"win\" to specify the goal, \"sink\" to make items drown in it, and so on). The objective of each level is for the player to reach the goal by manipulating these tiles to create or modify \"rules\" by which they behave. For example, the goal can be changed by moving \"is\" and \"win\" blocks to another object, and the player can travel through objects by removing the \"stop\" trait from them.<ref name=\":0\" /> Levels can force specific rules by placing their blocks in a corner, so they cannot be moved.<ref name=\":1\" /> The game contains over 200 levels.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n== Development and release ==\n[[File:Arvi Teikari GDC IGF 2018.png|thumb|Arvi Teikari accepting his [[Independent Games Festival]] Award in 2018|alt=Arvi Teikari speaking behind a podium.

He explained that levels were often created by brainstorming a \"cool\" or \"amusing\" solution, and then coming up with how the player would accomplish it.

Rauner only received 40.2% of the primary vote in 2014, in his narrow win victory over Kirk Dillard, Bill Brady, and Dan Rutherford.\n\nRauner did well in central Illinois compared to the Republican primary four years earlier, when he managed 30% in the downstate region and finished 2nd to Kirk Dillard.

However, those counties account for more than half of the state's total population. In the end, the election was not close with the Pritzker/Stratton ticket defeating the Rauner/Sanguinetti ticket by almost 16 percentage points. Pritzker won the traditionally Democratic [[Cook County]] which includes the [[Chicago Metropolitan Area]]. Pritzker also won in all but one of [[Chicago]]\u2019s collar counties, which used to be more of a tossup in years prior. Pritzker also did well in other cities such as [[East Saint Louis]] and [[Champaign]], and narrowly winning in [[Peoria, Illinois|Peoria]]. Rauner did well in most rural areas of the state, but it was not enough to put a dent into Pritzker\u2019s lead.

Rauner only received 40.2% of the primary vote in 2014, in his narrow win victory over Kirk Dillard, Bill Brady, and Dan Rutherford.\n\nRauner did well in central Illinois compared to the Republican primary four years earlier, when he managed 30% in the downstate region and finished 2nd to Kirk Dillard. In 2018, he carried the region with 52%.\n\nHowever, the result was still considered surprisingly close, and indicated widespread dissatisfaction with Rauner's governorship among more conservative Republicans.<ref>https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2018/3/20/17144724/illinois-gov-bruce-rauner-republican-primary</ref>\n\n==Third parties and independents==\nIn order to qualify as an established party in Illinois, a candidate for said party must earn at least 5% of the vote in a statewide election.

However, those counties account for more than half of the state's total population. In the end, the election was not close with the Pritzker/Stratton ticket defeating the Rauner/Sanguinetti ticket by almost 16 percentage points. Pritzker won the traditionally Democratic [[Cook County]] which includes the [[Chicago Metropolitan Area]]. Pritzker also won in all but one of [[Chicago]]\u2019s collar counties, which used to be more of a tossup in years prior. Pritzker also did well in other cities such as [[East Saint Louis]] and [[Champaign]], and narrowly winning in [[Peoria, Illinois|Peoria]]. Rauner did well in most rural areas of the state, but it was not enough to put a dent into Pritzker\u2019s lead. Pritzker and Stratton were sworn in on January 14, 2019.  \n{{Election box begin| title=Illinois gubernatorial election, 2018<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.elections.il.gov/ElectionResults.aspx?ID=jwAfLjnmELI=|title=Election Results|website=Elections.il.gov|accessdate=March 8, 2019}}</ref>}}\n\n[[File:Illinois Governor Election Results by County, 2018 (McCann).svg|thumb|upright|Support for McCann by county\n{{collapsible list\n|title=Map legend\n|{{legend|#003a13|>35%}}\n|{{legend|#005522|30\u201335%}}\n|{{legend|#00aa44|20\u201325%}}\n|{{legend|#00d455|15\u201320%}}\n|{{legend|#00ec66|10\u201315%}}\n|{{legend|#2aff80|5\u201310%}}\n|{{legend|#7bff9c|<5%}}\n}}\n]]\n\n{{Election box winning candidate with party link \n| candidate  =  [[J.

It was lauded by critics for its innovations in production, songwriting and graphic design, for bridging a cultural divide between [[popular music]] and [[high art]], and for reflecting the interests of [[Baby boomers|contemporary youth]] and [[Counterculture of the 1960s|the counterculture]]. It won four [[Grammy Award]]s in 1968, including [[Grammy Award for Album of the Year|Album of the Year]], the first rock [[LP record|LP]] to receive this honour.\n\nIn August 1966, the Beatles permanently retired from touring and began a three-month holiday. During a return flight to [[London]] in November, [[Paul McCartney]] had an idea for a song involving an [[Edwardian era|Edwardian]] military band that formed the impetus of the ''Sgt. Pepper'' concept. Sessions began on 24 November at [[Abbey Road Studios|EMI Studios]] with two compositions inspired by the Beatles' youth, \"[[Strawberry Fields Forever]]\" and \"[[Penny Lane]]\", but after pressure from [[EMI]], the songs were released as a [[double A-side]] single and left off the album.\n\nIn February 1967, after recording [[Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band (song)|the title track]], McCartney suggested that the album represent a performance by the fictional Sgt. Pepper band. This [[alter ego]] group further inspired the band to experiment artistically. During the recording sessions, there was no thought of reproducing the songs in concert, and the band were free to continue the technological experimentation marked by their previous album ''[[Revolver (Beatles album)|Revolver]]'', this time without an absolute deadline for completion. With producer [[George Martin]] and engineer [[Geoff Emerick]], the group approached the [[Recording studio as an instrument|studio as an instrument]], colouring much of the recordings with sound effects and tape manipulation, as exemplified on \"[[Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds]]\", \"[[Being for the Benefit of Mr. Kite!]]\" and \"[[A Day in the Life]]\". Recording was completed on 21 April 1967. The cover, which depicts the Beatles posing in front of a [[List of images on the cover of Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band|tableau of celebrities and historical figures]], was designed by the [[pop art]]ists [[Peter Blake (artist)|Peter Blake]] and [[Jann Haworth]].\n\n''Sgt. Pepper'' is regarded by musicologists as an early [[concept album]] that advanced the use of [[Cyclic form|extended form]] in popular music while continuing the artistic maturation seen on the Beatles' preceding releases. An important work of British [[psychedelic music|psychedelia]], the album incorporates a range of stylistic influences, including [[vaudeville]], [[Circus music|circus]], [[music hall]], [[Avant-garde music|avant-garde]], and [[Classical music|Western]] and [[Indian classical music]]. It is described as one of the first [[art rock]] LPs, a progenitor to [[progressive rock]], and the starting point of the [[album era]]. In 2003, the [[Library of Congress]] placed ''Sgt. Pepper'' in the [[National Recording Registry]] as \"culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant\".<ref name=\"LoC2003\" /> ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' ranked it as the [[Rolling Stone's 500 Greatest Albums of All Time|greatest album of all time]]. It is one of the [[List of best-selling albums|best-selling albums]] of all time, with more than 32 million copies sold worldwide as of 2011, and remains the UK's best-selling studio album.

Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band]]\" was the first example of the Beatles recording via direct injection (DI), which Townsend devised as a method for plugging electric guitars directly into the recording console.{{sfn|Womack|2007|p=170}} In Womack's opinion, the use of DI on the album's title track \"afforded McCartney's bass with richer textures and tonal clarity\".{{sfn|Womack|2007|p=170}}\n\nSome of the mixing employed [[automatic double tracking]] (ADT), a system that uses tape recorders to create a simultaneous doubling of a sound. ADT was invented by Townsend during the ''Revolver'' sessions in 1966 especially for the Beatles, who regularly expressed a desire for a technical alternative to having to record doubled lead vocals.{{sfn|Lewisohn|2010|p=216}} Another important effect was [[Pitch shift|varispeeding]], a technique that the Beatles used extensively on ''Revolver''.{{sfn|Emerick|Massey|2006|p=190}} Martin cites \"Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds\" as having the most variations of tape speed on ''Sgt. Pepper''. During the recording of Lennon's vocals, the tape speed was reduced from 50 cycles per second to 45, which produced a higher and thinner-sounding track when played back at the normal speed.{{sfn|Martin|Pearson|1994|p=105}} For the album's title track, the recording of Starr's drum kit was enhanced by the use of [[Damping (music)|damping]] and [[Microphone practice#Basic techniques|close-miking]].

Pepper'' conveyed the [[psychedelic experience]] so effectively to listeners unfamiliar with hallucinogenic drugs that \"If such a thing as a cultural '[[contact high]]' is possible, it happened here.\"{{sfn|MacDonald|2005|pp=249\u201350}} According to author Michael Frontani, the Beatles \"legitimiz[ed] the lifestyle of the counterculture\", just as they did popular music, and formed the basis of [[Jann Wenner]]'s scope on these issues when launching ''Rolling Stone'' magazine in late 1967.{{sfn|Frontani|2007|pp=125, 178\u201380}}\n\nMany rock critics and fans responded unfavourably to subsequent records by other artists in the view that they were unsuccessful attempts at matching the Beatles' studio artistry on ''Sgt. Pepper''.{{sfn|Frontani|2007|p=173}} These included the Beach Boys' ''[[Smiley Smile]]'' and the Rolling Stones' ''Their Satanic Majesties Request''.{{sfn|Frontani|2007|pp=188\u2013189}} Discussing the latter, Wenner referred to \"the post\u2013''Sgt. Pepper'' trap of trying to put out a 'progressive,' 'significant' and 'different' album, as revolutionary as the Beatles. But it couldn't be done, because only the Beatles can put out an album by the Beatles.\"{{sfn|Frontani|2007|p=188}}{{refn|group=nb|Everett similarly characterises ''Their Satanic Majesties Request'' and the [[Small Faces]]' ''[[Ogdens' Nut Gone Flake]]'' as ''Sgt.

Pepper'' \u2013 were shared by many and repeated in the vast majority of articles for ''Rolling Stone''.{{sfn|Frontani|2007|pp=186\u2013187, 189\u2013190, 192}}\n\nSimon Frith, in his overview of 1967 for ''The History of Rock'', said that ''Sgt. Pepper'' \"defined the year\" by conveying the optimism and sense of empowerment at the centre of the youth movement. He added that [[the Velvet Underground]]'s ''[[The Velvet Underground & Nico]]'', an album that contrasted sharply with the Beatles' message by \"offer[ing] no escape\", became more relevant in a cultural climate typified by \"the [[Sex Pistols]], the new political aggression, the rioting in the streets\" during the 1970s.<ref name=\"Frith/HoR\" /> In a 1987 review for ''[[Q (magazine)|Q]]'' magazine, [[Charles Shaar Murray]] asserted that ''Sgt.

Ned Rorem and Leonard Bernstein.{{sfn|Frontani|2007|pp=155}} According to Rodriguez, an element of exaggeration accompanied some of the acclaim for ''Sgt. Pepper'', with particularly effusive approbation coming from Rorem, Bernstein and Tynan, \"as if every critic was seeking to outdo the other for the most lavish embrace of the Beatles' new direction\".{{sfn|Rodriguez|2012|p=212}}{{refn|group=nb|In the November 1967 issue of ''[[DownBeat|Down Beat]]'' magazine, John Gabree complained that the Beatles were being afforded excessive praise by writers that were unfamiliar with rock music and unaware of the advances made by rival acts such as the Mothers of Invention and [[the Who]].{{sfn|Rodriguez|2012|p=216}}}} In Gendron's view, the cultural approbation represented American \"highbrow\" commentators (Rorem and Poirier) looking to establish themselves over their \"low-middlebrow\" equivalent, after ''Time'' and ''Newsweek'' had led the way in recognising the Beatles' artistry, and over the new discipline of rock criticism.{{sfn|Gendron|2002|pp=197\u201398}} Gendron describes the discourse as one whereby, during a period that lasted for six months, \"highbrow\" composers and musicologists \"jostl[ed] to pen the definitive effusive appraisal of the Beatles\".{{sfn|Gendron|2002|pp=1, 197}}\n\nAside from the attention afforded the album in literary and scholarly journals, the American jazz magazines ''[[DownBeat|Down Beat]]'' and ''Jazz'' both began to cover rock music for the first time, with the latter changing its name to ''[[Jazz & Pop]]'' as a result.{{sfn|Gould|2007|pp=420\u201321}} In addition, following ''Sgt. Pepper'', established American publications such as ''[[Vogue (magazine)|Vogue]]'', ''[[Playboy]]'' and the ''[[San Francisco Chronicle]]'' started discussing rock as art, in terms usually reserved for jazz criticism.{{sfn|Philo|2015|p=122}} Writing for ''Rolling Stone'' in 1969, Michael Lydon said that reviewers had had to invent \"new criticism\" to match pop's musical advances, since: \"Writing had to be an appropriate response to the music; in writing about, say, ''Sgt. Pepper'', you had to try to write something as good as ''Sgt. Pepper''. Because, of course, what made that record beautiful was the beautiful response it created in you; if your written response was true to your listening response, the writing would stand on its own as a creation on par with the record.\"<ref>{{cite magazine|first=Michael|last=Lydon|title=Paul Williams ''Outlaw Blues: A Book of Rock Music''|magazine=[[Rolling Stone]]|date=19 April 1969|p=}}</ref>\n\n=== Studio as instrument ===\n{{Main|Recording studio as an instrument}}\n{{quote box|quote= Equal credit [for ''Sgt.

Pepper'' sessions.{{sfn|Julien|2008c|p=162}}}} He credits [[Edgard Var\u00e8se]]'s ''[[Po\u00e8me \u00e9lectronique]]'' as the piece of music that made this advance feasible, by \"expand[ing] the definition of sound recording from archival documentation to the reification of the musical canvass\"; he identifies \"A Day in the Life\" as the ''Sgt. Pepper'' track that best exemplifies this approach.{{sfn|MacFarlane|2008|pp=39\u201340}}\n\nAccording to Julien, ''Sgt. Pepper'' represents the \"epitome of the transformation of the recording studio into a compositional tool\", marking the moment when \"popular music entered the era of phonographic composition.\"{{sfn|Julien|2008c|pp=166\u2013167}} The musician and producer [[Alan Parsons]] believes that with ''Sgt. Pepper'' \"people then started thinking that you could spend a year making an album and they began to consider an album as a sound composition and not just a musical composition. The idea was gradually forming of a record being a performance in its own right and not just a reproduction of a live performance.\"{{sfn|Julien|2008c|p=167}}\n\nIn his book ''Sonic Alchemy'', David Howard says that many acts, \"from the Rolling Stones to [[The Four Seasons (band)|the Four Seasons]] to the [[Ultimate Spinach]]\", soon imitated the album's innovative production techniques, and that as a result of ''Sgt. Pepper'', the producer's role \"ballooned almost overnight\".{{sfn|Howard|2004|p=31}} In this regard, Lennon and McCartney complained that Martin had received too much attention for his role in the album's creation,{{sfn|Hertsgaard|1996|pp=172\u201373}} so beginning a feeling of resentment by the Beatles towards their longtime producer.{{sfn|Gould|2007|p=489}}{{refn|group=nb|The group were particularly annoyed that ''Time'' had referred to ''Sgt.

And there's got to be a little bitterness over that.\"{{sfn|Hertsgaard|1996|p=172}}}}\n\n===Graphic design===\nInglis notes that almost every account of the significance of ''Sgt. Pepper'' emphasises the cover's \"unprecedented correspondence between music and art, time and space\".{{sfn|Inglis|2008|p=101}} After its release, album sleeves were no longer \"a superfluous thing to be discarded during the act of listening, but an integral component of the listening that expanded the musical experience\".{{sfn|Inglis|2008|p=101}} The cover helped to elevate album art as a respected topic for critical analysis whereby the \"structures and cultures of popular music\" could henceforth justify intellectual discourse in a way that \u2013 before ''Sgt. Pepper'' \u2013 would have seemed like \"fanciful conceit\".{{sfn|Inglis|2008|p=102}} He writes: ''Sgt. Pepper''{{'s}} \"cover has been regarded as groundbreaking in its visual and aesthetic properties, congratulated for its innovative and imaginative design, credited with providing an early impetus for the expansion of the graphic design industry into popular music, and perceived as largely responsible for the connections between art and pop to be made explicit.\"{{sfn|Inglis|2008|p=102}}\n\n''Sgt. Pepper'' contributed to the popular trend for military-style fashions as adopted by London's boutique shops.{{sfn|Whiteley|2008|p=11}} Riley describes the cover as \"one of the best-known works that pop art ever produced\",{{sfn|Riley|2002|p=212}} while Norman calls it \"the most famous album cover of all time\".{{sfn|Norman|2016|p=264}} In 1968, the band followed ''Sgt.

Pepper''.{{sfn|Frontani|2007|p=172}} In the late 1990s, the BBC included the ''Sgt.

Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band''''' is the eighth [[studio album]] by the English [[Rock music|rock]] band [[the Beatles]]. Released on 26 May 1967 in the United Kingdom{{refn|group=nb|According to author Allen J. Wiener, the album's intended release date of 1 June has been \"traditionally observed\" over the ensuing decades, yet the true release date was 26 May.{{sfn|Wiener|1992|p=31}}}} and 2 June 1967 in the United States, it spent 27 weeks at number one on the [[UK Albums Chart]] and 15 weeks at number one on the [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' Top LPs]] chart in the US. It was lauded by critics for its innovations in production, songwriting and graphic design, for bridging a cultural divide between [[popular music]] and [[high art]], and for reflecting the interests of [[Baby boomers|contemporary youth]] and [[Counterculture of the 1960s|the counterculture]]. It won four [[Grammy Award]]s in 1968, including [[Grammy Award for Album of the Year|Album of the Year]], the first rock [[LP record|LP]] to receive this honour.\n\nIn August 1966, the Beatles permanently retired from touring and began a three-month holiday. During a return flight to [[London]] in November, [[Paul McCartney]] had an idea for a song involving an [[Edwardian era|Edwardian]] military band that formed the impetus of the ''Sgt. Pepper'' concept. Sessions began on 24 November at [[Abbey Road Studios|EMI Studios]] with two compositions inspired by the Beatles' youth, \"[[Strawberry Fields Forever]]\" and \"[[Penny Lane]]\", but after pressure from [[EMI]], the songs were released as a [[double A-side]] single and left off the album.\n\nIn February 1967, after recording [[Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band (song)|the title track]], McCartney suggested that the album represent a performance by the fictional Sgt. Pepper band. This [[alter ego]] group further inspired the band to experiment artistically. During the recording sessions, there was no thought of reproducing the songs in concert, and the band were free to continue the technological experimentation marked by their previous album ''[[Revolver (Beatles album)|Revolver]]'', this time without an absolute deadline for completion. With producer [[George Martin]] and engineer [[Geoff Emerick]], the group approached the [[Recording studio as an instrument|studio as an instrument]], colouring much of the recordings with sound effects and tape manipulation, as exemplified on \"[[Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds]]\", \"[[Being for the Benefit of Mr. Kite!]]\" and \"[[A Day in the Life]]\". Recording was completed on 21 April 1967. The cover, which depicts the Beatles posing in front of a [[List of images on the cover of Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band|tableau of celebrities and historical figures]], was designed by the [[pop art]]ists [[Peter Blake (artist)|Peter Blake]] and [[Jann Haworth]].\n\n''Sgt. Pepper'' is regarded by musicologists as an early [[concept album]] that advanced the use of [[Cyclic form|extended form]] in popular music while continuing the artistic maturation seen on the Beatles' preceding releases. An important work of British [[psychedelic music|psychedelia]], the album incorporates a range of stylistic influences, including [[vaudeville]], [[Circus music|circus]], [[music hall]], [[Avant-garde music|avant-garde]], and [[Classical music|Western]] and [[Indian classical music]]. It is described as one of the first [[art rock]] LPs, a progenitor to [[progressive rock]], and the starting point of the [[album era]]. In 2003, the [[Library of Congress]] placed ''Sgt. Pepper'' in the [[National Recording Registry]] as \"culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant\".<ref name=\"LoC2003\" /> ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' ranked it as the [[Rolling Stone's 500 Greatest Albums of All Time|greatest album of all time]]. It is one of the [[List of best-selling albums|best-selling albums]] of all time, with more than 32 million copies sold worldwide as of 2011, and remains the UK's best-selling studio album. Professor Kevin Dettmar, writing in ''The Oxford Encyclopedia of British Literature'', described it as \"the most important and influential rock-and-roll album ever recorded\".{{sfn|Dettmar|2006|p=139}}\n{{TOC limit|3}}\n\n== Background ==\n{{quote box|quote= We were fed up with being the Beatles.

Beatles concerts are nothing to do with music anymore. They're just bloody tribal rites.\"{{sfn|The Beatles|2000|p=229}} In June that year, two days after finishing the album ''[[Revolver (Beatles album)|Revolver]]'', the group set off for a [[The Beatles' 1966 tour of Germany, Japan and the Philippines|tour that started in West Germany]].{{sfn|MacDonald|2005|p=212}} While in [[Hamburg]] they received an anonymous telegram stating: \"Do not go to Tokyo.

Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band''. Gould adds that McCartney's succumbing to peer pressure allowed Lennon \"to play the role of psychedelic guide\" to his songwriting partner, thereby facilitating a closer collaboration between the two than had been evident since early in the Beatles' career.{{sfn|Gould|2007|pp=388\u201389}} For his part, Lennon had turned deeply introspective during the filming of ''How I Won the War'' in southern Spain in September 1966. His anxiety over his and the Beatles' future was reflected in \"[[Strawberry Fields Forever]]\",{{sfn|Turner|2016|pp=332\u201333}} a song that provided the initial theme, regarding a Liverpool childhood, of the new album.{{sfn|Everett|1999|p=99}} On his return to London, Lennon embraced the city's arts culture, of which McCartney was a part,{{sfn|Rodriguez|2012|p=88}} and shared his bandmate's interest in [[Avant-garde music|avant-garde]] and [[Electronic music|electronic-music]] composers such as [[Karlheinz Stockhausen]], [[John Cage]] and [[Luciano Berio]].{{sfn|Sounes|2010|p=165}}{{sfn|Prendergast|2003|p=193}}\n\nIn November, during his and Evans' return flight from Kenya, McCartney had an idea for a song that eventually formed the impetus of the ''Sgt.

Pepper'' reflect the Beatles' general immersion in the [[blues]], [[Motown]] and other American popular musical traditions.{{sfn|Hannan|2008|p=62}} The author [[Ian MacDonald]] writes that when reviewing their rivals' recent work in late 1966, the Beatles identified the most significant LP as [[the Beach Boys]]' ''[[Pet Sounds]]'', which [[Brian Wilson]], the band's leader, had created in response to the Beatles' ''[[Rubber Soul]]''.{{sfn|MacDonald|2005|p=215}} McCartney was highly impressed with the \"harmonic structures\" and choice of instruments used on ''Pet Sounds'', and said that these elements encouraged him to think the Beatles could \"get further out\" than the Beach Boys had.{{sfn|Babiuk|2002|p=197}} He identified ''Pet Sounds'' as his main musical inspiration for ''Sgt. Pepper'', adding that \"[we] nicked a few ideas\",{{sfn|Babiuk|2002|p=204}} although he felt it lacked the avant-garde quality he was seeking.{{sfn|The Beatles|2000|p=253}} ''[[Freak Out!]]'' by [[the Mothers of Invention]] has also been cited as having influenced ''Sgt. Pepper''.{{sfn|Julien|2008c|p=160}} According to the biographer [[Philip Norman (author)|Philip Norman]], during the recording sessions McCartney repeatedly stated: \"This is our ''Freak Out!''\"{{sfn|Julien|2008c|p=158}} The music journalist [[Chet Flippo]] stated that McCartney was inspired to record a [[concept album]] after hearing ''Freak Out!''{{sfn|Julien|2008c|p=160}}\n\n[[Indian music]] was another touchstone on ''Sgt. Pepper'', principally for Lennon and Harrison.{{sfn|Reck|2008|pp=69, 72\u201373}} In a 1967 interview, Harrison said that the Beatles' ongoing success had encouraged them to continue developing musically and that, given their standing, \"We can do things that please us without conforming to the standard pop idea. We are not only involved in pop music, but all music.\"{{sfn|Philo|2015|p=119}} McCartney envisioned the Beatles' alter egos being able to \"do a bit of [[B.B. King]], a bit of Stockhausen, a bit of [[Albert Ayler]], a bit of Ravi Shankar, a bit of ''Pet Sounds'', a bit of [[the Doors]]\".{{sfn|Greene|2016|p=19}} He saw the group as \"pushing frontiers\" similar to other composers of the time, even though the Beatles did not \"necessarily like what, say, Berio was doing\".{{sfn|Lewisohn|2005}}\n\n== Recording and production ==\n===Recording history===\n[[File:Abbeyroadtomswain.jpg|thumb|left|alt=A colour image of a large room with a piano in the middle|[[Abbey Road Studios|Abbey Road Studio Two]], where nearly every track on ''Sgt.

Pepper''.{{sfn|Greene|2016|pp=34, 42}} Martin later described the decision to drop these two songs as \"the biggest mistake of my professional life\".{{sfn|Martin|Pearson|1994|p=26}} In his judgment, \"Strawberry Fields Forever\", which he and the band spent an unprecedented 55 hours of studio time recording, \"set the agenda for the whole album\".<ref>{{harvnb|MacDonald|2005|p=219}}: 55 hours of studio time; {{harvnb|Martin|Pearson|1994|p=13}}: \"set the agenda for the whole album\".</ref> He explained: \"It was going to be a record&nbsp;...

Pepper'' marks the beginning of McCartney's ascendancy as the Beatles' dominant creative force. He wrote more than half of the album's material while asserting increasing control over the recording of his compositions.{{sfn|Everett|1999|p=99}}{{refn|group=nb|In Emerick's opinion, the recording of ''Sgt.

ADT was invented by Townsend during the ''Revolver'' sessions in 1966 especially for the Beatles, who regularly expressed a desire for a technical alternative to having to record doubled lead vocals.{{sfn|Lewisohn|2010|p=216}} Another important effect was [[Pitch shift|varispeeding]], a technique that the Beatles used extensively on ''Revolver''.{{sfn|Emerick|Massey|2006|p=190}} Martin cites \"Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds\" as having the most variations of tape speed on ''Sgt. Pepper''. During the recording of Lennon's vocals, the tape speed was reduced from 50 cycles per second to 45, which produced a higher and thinner-sounding track when played back at the normal speed.{{sfn|Martin|Pearson|1994|p=105}} For the album's title track, the recording of Starr's drum kit was enhanced by the use of [[Damping (music)|damping]] and [[Microphone practice#Basic techniques|close-miking]].

He also said that in the context of 1967, ''Sgt.

He added that [[the Velvet Underground]]'s ''[[The Velvet Underground & Nico]]'', an album that contrasted sharply with the Beatles' message by \"offer[ing] no escape\", became more relevant in a cultural climate typified by \"the [[Sex Pistols]], the new political aggression, the rioting in the streets\" during the 1970s.<ref name=\"Frith/HoR\" /> In a 1987 review for ''[[Q (magazine)|Q]]'' magazine, [[Charles Shaar Murray]] asserted that ''Sgt.

Ned Rorem and Leonard Bernstein.{{sfn|Frontani|2007|pp=155}} According to Rodriguez, an element of exaggeration accompanied some of the acclaim for ''Sgt.

Pepper'', established American publications such as ''[[Vogue (magazine)|Vogue]]'', ''[[Playboy]]'' and the ''[[San Francisco Chronicle]]'' started discussing rock as art, in terms usually reserved for jazz criticism.{{sfn|Philo|2015|p=122}} Writing for ''Rolling Stone'' in 1969, Michael Lydon said that reviewers had had to invent \"new criticism\" to match pop's musical advances, since: \"Writing had to be an appropriate response to the music; in writing about, say, ''Sgt. Pepper'', you had to try to write something as good as ''Sgt. Pepper''. Because, of course, what made that record beautiful was the beautiful response it created in you; if your written response was true to your listening response, the writing would stand on its own as a creation on par with the record.\"<ref>{{cite magazine|first=Michael|last=Lydon|title=Paul Williams ''Outlaw Blues: A Book of Rock Music''|magazine=[[Rolling Stone]]|date=19 April 1969|p=}}</ref>\n\n=== Studio as instrument ===\n{{Main|Recording studio as an instrument}}\n{{quote box|quote= Equal credit [for ''Sgt.

Pepper'' track that best exemplifies this approach.{{sfn|MacFarlane|2008|pp=39\u201340}}\n\nAccording to Julien, ''Sgt. Pepper'' represents the \"epitome of the transformation of the recording studio into a compositional tool\", marking the moment when \"popular music entered the era of phonographic composition.\"{{sfn|Julien|2008c|pp=166\u2013167}} The musician and producer [[Alan Parsons]] believes that with ''Sgt. Pepper'' \"people then started thinking that you could spend a year making an album and they began to consider an album as a sound composition and not just a musical composition. The idea was gradually forming of a record being a performance in its own right and not just a reproduction of a live performance.\"{{sfn|Julien|2008c|p=167}}\n\nIn his book ''Sonic Alchemy'', David Howard says that many acts, \"from the Rolling Stones to [[The Four Seasons (band)|the Four Seasons]] to the [[Ultimate Spinach]]\", soon imitated the album's innovative production techniques, and that as a result of ''Sgt. Pepper'', the producer's role \"ballooned almost overnight\".{{sfn|Howard|2004|p=31}} In this regard, Lennon and McCartney complained that Martin had received too much attention for his role in the album's creation,{{sfn|Hertsgaard|1996|pp=172\u201373}} so beginning a feeling of resentment by the Beatles towards their longtime producer.{{sfn|Gould|2007|p=489}}{{refn|group=nb|The group were particularly annoyed that ''Time'' had referred to ''Sgt.

And there's got to be a little bitterness over that.\"{{sfn|Hertsgaard|1996|p=172}}}}\n\n===Graphic design===\nInglis notes that almost every account of the significance of ''Sgt. Pepper'' emphasises the cover's \"unprecedented correspondence between music and art, time and space\".{{sfn|Inglis|2008|p=101}} After its release, album sleeves were no longer \"a superfluous thing to be discarded during the act of listening, but an integral component of the listening that expanded the musical experience\".{{sfn|Inglis|2008|p=101}} The cover helped to elevate album art as a respected topic for critical analysis whereby the \"structures and cultures of popular music\" could henceforth justify intellectual discourse in a way that \u2013 before ''Sgt. Pepper'' \u2013 would have seemed like \"fanciful conceit\".{{sfn|Inglis|2008|p=102}} He writes: ''Sgt. Pepper''{{'s}} \"cover has been regarded as groundbreaking in its visual and aesthetic properties, congratulated for its innovative and imaginative design, credited with providing an early impetus for the expansion of the graphic design industry into popular music, and perceived as largely responsible for the connections between art and pop to be made explicit.\"{{sfn|Inglis|2008|p=102}}\n\n''Sgt.
