The film also co-stars [[Angela Yu Chien]], [[Tien Feng]] and [[David Chiang]]. [[Lau Kar-leung]] served as action director for the film.\n\n==Plot==\nThe late King of the Martial World has written a coveted manual which details his skills which can turn the practitioner into a supreme fighter. Knowing his two disciples would be deadly rivals, he separated the manual into two parts: one with odd-numbered pages and the other with even number pages. The Yin family possesses the odd-numbered page manual while the Winged Tiger, Teng Fei (Cheng Lui), has the even-number paged manual. Master Yin ([[Tien Feng]]), the King of Hades, wants the entire manual and arranges his younger sister, Yin Cai-fa ([[Angela Yu Chien]]), to marry the Winged Tiger in order to obtain the other manual. The chief of\u00a0[[Mount Hua]] (Cheng Lui)\u00a0and the leaders of Eight Schools sends famed martial artist, Flying Hero Guo Jiou-ru ([[Chan Hung-lit]]), who is proficient in ventriloquism and posses comparable skills to Teng, to impersonate him and infiltrate the Yin household to steal away the other manual in order to prevent Yin from boosting his skills for evildoings. \n\nGuo arrives at the Peaceful Tavern and orders a room next to Teng where he eavesdrop on Teng's conversation with his assistant, the Soul-Sucking Lad (Wong Kin-wah), on his plan to pretend to fall for Cai-fa and requests Yin for the marriage with Cai-fa before he can learn the manual, as Teng is also after Yin's half of the manual. The next day, while on his way to the Yin Forest, Teng is attacked by martial artists who are after his manual, but he manages to kill all of them. Guo, who is disguised as Teng, is also attacked by a group of martial artists who are after Teng's manual. Teng happens to pass by during this time and joins Guo in the fight where they kill all of the martial artists. Afterwards, Teng asks Guo of his identity and the Soul-Sucking Lad and informs Teng of Guo's identity and his mission. Guo fights with Teng and the Soul-Sucking Lad and kills both of them and obtains Teng's manual. Master Liu Yi-ying (Fang Mian) and her daughter, Yan-qing (Annette Sam) arrives to bring a letter from the Right Schools to Guo suggesting him to destroy the manual to minimize his danger once he reaches the Yin Forest. Guo refuses to do so since he wants to obtain the full manual to spread its teachings to the martial world and rips off a couple pages of the manual and gives it to Yan-qing in cases he dies in his mission, Yin would not be able to obtain the complete manual. In return, Yan-qing gives Guo a mini sword which once impaled, the wound can only be treated by Master Liu.\n\nGuo arrives at the Yin Forest where he meets Yin, You Ming ([[Paul Wei Ping-ao|Paul Wei]]) and the Three Officers, Jade Face Bai Yun-sheng ([[David Chiang]]), Iron Hand Zhao Bi (Luo Han) and  Golden Face Liu Kun (Tong Tin-hei). Guo presents Yin with his part of the manual before speaking privately to You Ming, who is colluding with Teng to obtain Yin's part of the manual, although You Ming suspects Guo of his identity. At this time, the Three Officers also schemes to have Guo killed to take his manual and obtain Yin's manual as well.\n\nCai-fa, who is unhappy about her marriage with Teng, instantly changes her mind after she sees Guo in person and is smitten with him. Guo then stealths around the Yin mansion and kills several guards while Yan-qing also sneaks in to the Yin Forest to give a message to Guo. In the meantime, Teng's body was also discovered by Yin's lieutenant, Zhang Piao (Yeung Chsk-lam) and was brought into the Yin Forest where You Ming suspects Guo may be impersonating Teng. Since Teng flies with his wings while Guo jumps with the power of his feet stepping on each other, You Ming suggests Yin to test Guo's martial arts to see whether he knows Teng's signature killing technique. Guo then fights and kills a couple of Yin's henchman with Teng's signature killing technique and wins Yin's trust while also handing his part of the manual to Yin. You Ming, however, is still suspicious of Guo's identity and suggests Yin to lure Guo to the steal the manual by telling Cai-fa to inform Guo where the manual is hidden.\n\nGuo secretly follows Yin, Cai-fa and You Ming when they hide the manual inside a tripod inside a cave. When Cai-fa returns to the mansion, Guo fakes s conversation with a shadow mannequin of You Ming where he pretends to tell You Ming that he is no longer interested in the manual since he was fallen in love with Cai-fa and wants to marry her. Guo and Cai-fa make love and Cai-fa reveals Yin and You Ming's plan to him about testing his sincerity. At this time, Yan-qing had also snuck into the Yin mansion and unhappy of Guo and Cai-fa's relationship, Guo explains to her about pretending to be in love with Cai-fa, who overhead their conversation. Cai-fa informs her brother of Guo's identity and ambushes Guo. After an extended fight with Yin's guards, Guo was heavily injured and flies away where he then hides in Cai-fa's room. Despite his betrayal, Cai-fa is still very much in love with Guo and nurse him back to health and Guo reveals to her his true intention of obtaining the full manual and spread its teachings to the martial world and that they can be together after he succeeds but she is not completely convinced.\n\nCai-fa ties Guo up but he escapes by burning the rope with a candle when Cai-fa fell asleep and goes to the cave to steal the manual. However, the tripod turns out empty and Yin traps Guo inside the cave. Cai-fa then arrives to attack Guo with enticing bombs which are really duds as she actually helps him escape and fend of Yin's thugs, but Guo accidentally impales her with the sword given to him by Yan-qing. Cai-fa tells Guo she does not hate him for using her and would rather him pretend to love her until the very end while Guo also deduces he has fallen into You Ming's trap of using him to steal the manual. You Ming also arrives at this time and Guo fights and kills him before fighting and killing the Three Officers. Guo then attempts to flee with Cai-fa was stopped by Zhang and more guards and kills them before Yin arrives and fights with Guo where Yin gains the upper hand when he wraps his whip around Guo's neck.

The film also co-stars [[Angela Yu Chien]], [[Tien Feng]] and [[David Chiang]]. [[Lau Kar-leung]] served as action director for the film.\n\n==Plot==\nThe late King of the Martial World has written a coveted manual which details his skills which can turn the practitioner into a supreme fighter. Knowing his two disciples would be deadly rivals, he separated the manual into two parts: one with odd-numbered pages and the other with even number pages. The Yin family possesses the odd-numbered page manual while the Winged Tiger, Teng Fei (Cheng Lui), has the even-number paged manual. Master Yin ([[Tien Feng]]), the King of Hades, wants the entire manual and arranges his younger sister, Yin Cai-fa ([[Angela Yu Chien]]), to marry the Winged Tiger in order to obtain the other manual. The chief of\u00a0[[Mount Hua]] (Cheng Lui)\u00a0and the leaders of Eight Schools sends famed martial artist, Flying Hero Guo Jiou-ru ([[Chan Hung-lit]]), who is proficient in ventriloquism and posses comparable skills to Teng, to impersonate him and infiltrate the Yin household to steal away the other manual in order to prevent Yin from boosting his skills for evildoings. \n\nGuo arrives at the Peaceful Tavern and and orders a room next to Teng where he eavesdrop on Teng's conversation with his assistant, the Soul-Sucking Lad (Wong Kin-wah), on his plan to pretend to fall for Cai-fa and requests Yin for the marriage with Cai-fa before he can learn the manual, as Teng is also after Yin's half of the manual. The next day, while on his way to the Yin Forest, Teng is attacked by martial artists who are after his manual, but he manages to kill all of them. Guo, who is disguised as Teng, is also attacked by a group of martial artists who are after Teng's manual. Teng happens to pass by during this time and joins Guo in the fight where they kill all of the martial artists. Afterwards, Teng asks Guo of his identity and the Soul-Sucking Lad and informs Teng of Guo's identity and his mission. Guo fights with Teng and the Soul-Sucking Lad and kills both of them and obtains Teng's manual. Master Liu Yi-ying (Fang Mian) and her daughter, Yan-qing (Annette Sam) arrives to bring a letter from the Right Schools to Guo suggesting him to destroy the manual to minimize his danger once he reaches the Yin Forest. Guo refuses to do so since he wants to obtain the full manual to spread its teachings to the martial world and rips off a couple pages of the manual and gives it to Yan-qing in cases he dies in his mission, Yin would not be able to obtain the complete manual. In return, Yan-qing gives Guo a mini sword which once impaled, the wound can only be treated by Master Liu.\n\nGuo arrives at the Yin Forest where he meets Yin, You Ming ([[Paul Wei Ping-ao|Paul Wei]]) and the Three Officers, Jade Face Bai Yun-sheng ([[David Chiang]]), Iron Hand Zhao Bi (Luo Han) and  Golden Face Liu Kun (Tong Tin-hei). Guo presents Yin with his part of the manual before speaking privately to You Ming, who is colluding with Teng to obtain Yin's part of the manual, although You Ming suspects Guo of his identity. At this time, the Three Officers also schemes to have Guo killed to take his manual and obtain Yin's manual as well.\n\nCai-fa, who is unhappy about her marriage with Teng, instantly changes her mind after she sees Guo in person and is smitten with him. Guo then stealths around the Yin mansion and kills several guards while Yan-qing also sneaks in to the Yin Forest to give a message to Guo. In the meantime, Teng's body was also discovered by Yin's lieutenant, Zhang Piao (Yeung Chsk-lam) and was brought into the Yin Forest where You Ming suspects Guo may be impersonating Teng. Since Teng flies with his wings while Guo jumps with the power of his feet stepping on each other, You Ming suggests Yin to test Guo's martial arts to see whether he knows Teng's signature killing technique. Guo then fights and kills a couple of Yin's henchman with Teng's signature killing technique and wins Yin's trust while also handing his part of the manual to Yin. You Ming, however, is still suspicious of Guo's identity and suggests Yin to lure Guo to the steal the manual by telling Cai-fa to inform Guo where the manual is hidden.\n\nGuo secretly follows Yin, Cai-fa and You Ming when they hide the manual inside a tripod inside a cave. When Cai-fa returns to the mansion, Guo fakes s conversation with a shadow mannequin of You Ming where he pretends to tell You Ming that he is no longer interested in the manual since he was fallen in love with Cai-fa and wants to marry her. Guo and Cai-fa make love and Cai-fa reveals Yin and You Ming's plan to him about testing his sincerity. At this time, Yan-qing had also snuck into the Yin mansion and unhappy of Guo and Cai-fa's relationship, Guo explains to her about pretending to be in love with Cai-fa, who overhead their conversation. Cai-fa informs her brother of Guo's identity and ambushes Guo. After an extended fight with Yin's guards, Guo was heavily injured and flies away where he then hides in Cai-fa's room. Despite his betrayal, Cai-fa is still very much in love with Guo and nurse him back to health and Guo reveals to her his true intention of obtaining the full manual and spread its teachings to the martial world and that they can be together after he succeeds but she is not completely convinced.\n\nCai-fa ties Guo up but he escapes by burning the rope with a candle when Cai-fa fell asleep and goes to the cave to steal the manual. However, the tripod turns out empty and Yin traps Guo inside the cave. Cai-fa then arrives to attack Guo with enticing bombs which are really duds as she actually helps him escape and fend of Yin's thugs, but Guo accidentally impales her with the sword given to him by Yan-qing. Cai-fa tells Guo she does not hate him for using her and would rather him pretend to love her until the very end while Guo also deduces he has fallen into You Ming's trap of using him to steal the manual. You Ming also arrives at this time and Guo fights and kills him before fighting and killing the Three Officers. Guo then attempts to flee with Cai-fa was stopped by Zhang and more guards and kills them before Yin arrives and fights with Guo where Yin gains the upper hand when he wraps his whip around Guo's neck. In order to save him, Cai-fa asks Guo to give Yin the manual and it is revealed Yin never hid the manual in the cave and wanted to pages that Guo ripped off from the odd-numbered manual. Cai-fa then pulls out the sword implaled in her and cuts off Yin's whip and Guo kills Yin.

In this form, he proclaimed himself as \"The Lord of Darkness\".{{citation needed|date=March 2017}} Following Survivor Series, The Undertaker briefly turned his attention to The Executioner, who had been interfering in his matches since his arrival.

Bearer accused The Undertaker of having burned down the family [[funeral home]] business when he was a child, killing his parents and ostensibly his younger half-brother as well. The Undertaker denied all this; however, Bearer claimed to have proof in the form of The Undertaker's alive and well half-brother Kane, who had survived though scarred and burned. Bearer raised Kane after the fire, having him institutionalized from the date of the fire into adulthood. Ever since the fire, Kane had been awaiting to exact vengeance on his older half-brother. In defense, Undertaker responded that Kane, a pyromaniac, had been the one to set the fire and could not have possibly even survived. Also during the period, Bearer had unintentionally admitted to Undertaker's mother having an affair with him. As a result, it was revealed to The Undertaker that Kane was his half-brother. Until that point, Undertaker spent his life (the entirety of the father's life) under the impression that Kane was fully related to him and his family.

During the match, The Undertaker threw Mankind off the roof of the {{convert|16|ft|m|abbr=on|disp=flip}} cell onto a broadcast table below, in what was a preplanned move. He later performed a chokeslam on Mankind through the roof of the cell into the ring which legitimately knocked Mankind unconscious.

Shortly before SummerSlam, however, The Undertaker revealed that he and Kane were working together as brothers. Despite this revelation, The Undertaker told Kane that he did not want him to interfere in the match with Austin and even though The Undertaker lost the match, he handed Austin his [[Championship belt#Professional wrestling|championship belt]] back after the match in a show of respect.<ref name=pwi100 /> In September, the storyline continued and The Undertaker began to show some villainous characteristics when he and Kane revealed the fact that they were in cahoots to rid Austin of his title for Mr. McMahon. At [[Breakdown: In Your House]], The Undertaker and Kane were booked in a [[Professional wrestling match types#Basic non-elimination matches|triple threat match]] with Austin for the WWF Championship, in which McMahon stated that the brothers were not allowed to pin each other. The Undertaker and Kane pinned Austin simultaneously after a [[Chokeslam#Double chokeslam|double chokeslam]], so the title was vacated by McMahon.<ref name=pwi100 /> This event led to a match at [[Judgment Day: In Your House]] between The Undertaker and Kane for the title, with Austin as the special guest referee. Near the end of the match, Paul Bearer seemed about to assist Kane by handing him a steel chair to hit The Undertaker with, but as Kane had his back turned, both Bearer and The Undertaker hit Kane with the chair. The Undertaker went for the pin, but Austin refused to count the fall, attacked The Undertaker and counted out both of them.<ref name=pwi100 /> Finally, The Undertaker became a villain the next night on ''Raw'' for the first time in over six years, reconciling with Bearer and claiming that he and Bearer would unleash their \"[[The Ministry of Darkness|Ministry of Darkness]]\" on the World Wrestling Federation. As part of this new storyline, he admitted that he had indeed set the fire that killed his parents, for which he had previously blamed Kane.{{cn|date=December 2019}}\n\n==== Ministry of Darkness (1998\u20131999) ====\n{{Main|Ministry of Darkness}}\nAfter [[Survivor Series (1998)|Survivor Series]], The Undertaker returned his attention to his previous feud with Austin for costing him the title at Judgment Day, hitting Austin in the head with a shovel during a title match with [[Dwayne Johnson|The Rock]], returning the favor for what happened a month earlier. With this twist in the storyline, Mr. McMahon scheduled a Buried Alive match between The Undertaker and Austin at [[Rock Bottom: In Your House]]. In the weeks leading up to Rock Bottom, The Undertaker attempted to embalm Austin alive, tried to have Kane committed to a [[Psychiatric hospital|mental asylum]] and had his druids chain Austin to his symbol, raising it high into the arena.{{cn|date=December 2019}} However, The Undertaker lost the match after Kane interfered.<ref name=pwi102>2007 Wrestling almanac & book of facts. \"Wrestling's historical cards\" (p. 102).</ref>\n\nAfter building up to his second villainous run in the latter part of 1998, The Undertaker introduced an updated version of his Deadman identity by January 1999 \u2013 the dark priest who in the initial period of this persona reigned over a stable known as The Ministry of Darkness. In this form, he took on a wicked, demonic presence, much more so than ever before. He often claimed to be invoking and taking orders from a \"Higher Power\". Moreover, he often appeared in a hooded black robe and sat on a throne that was specially designed into his character symbol. With the help of his minions, he often performed sacrifices on select WWF wrestlers, using various [[incantation]]s and [[magic word]]s with intent to extract out the dark side of the wrestlers in question to recruit them into his Ministry. The completed Ministry of Darkness consisted of [[The Brood (professional wrestling)|The Brood]] ([[Christian Cage|Christian]], [[Edge (wrestler)|Edge]] and [[Gangrel (wrestler)|Gangrel]]), [[Acolytes Protection Agency|The Acolytes]] (Bradshaw and [[Ron Simmons|Faarooq]]), [[Dennis Knight|Mideon]] and [[Viscera (wrestler)|Viscera]]. Calaway himself did not wrestle for a period having undergone a hip replacement. As part of the [[Glossary of professional wrestling terms#Angle|angle]], Undertaker expressed a desire to take control of the World Wrestling Federation, displacing its owner, Mr. McMahon. These ambitions culminated into a rivalry between The Ministry and [[The Corporation (professional wrestling)|The Corporation]], ultimately resulting in a match between Undertaker and Corporation enforcer, [[Big Boss Man (wrestler)|Big Boss Man]].

After their victory at [[SummerSlam (1999)|SummerSlam]], The Undertaker suffered a groin tear and was seen [[limp]]ing in several matches. He avoided competing in wrestling matches in the following weeks, instead tyrannically ordering Big Show to fight all his battles and oblige all his many wishes. He also began to transition away to the biker character he would play in 2000. Per an interview with Kevin Nash, this was a move to allow Calaway to enter World Championship Wrestling with a non-trademarked persona. Had he entered WCW, it would have been as Mark Calaway. Although negotiations were described as close, he ultimately re-signed with the World Wrestling Federation.{{cn|date=December 2019}}\n\nTo compensate for his lack of physical activity, Undertaker became more vocal on the mic, often making [[Know-it-all|smart-aleck]] remarks and performing commentary.

He was portrayed as impervious to pain, something accomplished by Calaway [[Glossary of professional wrestling terms#No-sell|not selling]] his opponents' attacks. He was managed by Paul Bearer, who used an urn to give Undertaker supernatural powers. During his early years, he used the Funeral March by Chopin as his entrance theme. WWF composer Jim Johnson changed the Chopin march to create a new theme, the Graveyard Symphony.<ref>https://superluchas.com/jim-johnston-habla-del-proceso-tras-el-tema-de-entrada-de-the-undertaker/</ref>\n\nWhen he made his return in 2000, he abandoned the somber mortician-themed attires, his [[Funeral march|funeral dirge ring music]], allusions to the supernatural and the accompanying morbid theatrics. In place of this, he took on a biker identity, riding to the ring on a motorcycle and wearing sunglasses and bandanas to the ring. His [[Music in professional wrestling|entrance music]] was replaced with popular rock songs of the time, like [[Limp Bizkit]]'s \"[[Rollin' (Air Raid Vehicle)]]\" and [[Kid Rock]]'s \"[[American Bad Ass]]\" (from which the name of The Undertaker's new gimmick originated), though it was accompanied by the characteristic opening bell of The Undertaker's original theme.\n\nIn 2020, Undertaker started a feud with AJ Styles. Styles claimed that, in the last months, Undertaker lost his mystique because he broke kayfabe in social media and shoot interviews.

After signing for [[World Championship Wrestling]] (WCW) in 1989, he enjoyed a brief stint as a mid-card performer named \"Mean Mark\" Callous, before joining the World Wrestling Federation (WWF, now WWE) in 1990. He is the longest-tenured wrestler in the company, having been performing for 30 years.\n\nIn the WWF, Calaway was rebranded as \"The Undertaker\" and gained significant mainstream popularity as a [[Horror film|horror]]-themed, [[macabre]] entity who employed [[Fear mongering|scare tactics]] and held links to the [[supernatural]]. The Undertaker became one of the most prominent figures of the [[Attitude Era]], featuring in various pivotal storylines and matches as WWF sustained a boom period in business in the late 1990s. His character transitioned into a biker in the early 2000s, before returning to a refined version of his previous gimmick in 2004. The Undertaker is known for [[The Streak (wrestling)|The Streak]], a series of 21 straight victories at WWE's flagship annual event, [[WrestleMania]].\n\nCalaway has held 17 [[Professional wrestling championship|championships]].

The Undertaker has headlined multiple [[pay-per-view]] (PPV) [[List of WWE pay-per-view events|events for WWE]], including [[WrestleMania]] on five occasions. He is the only man to have headlined WrestleMania in four different decades (1990s, 2000s, 2010s and 2020s).

Bearer accused The Undertaker of having burned down the family [[funeral home]] business when he was a child, killing his parents and ostensibly his younger half-brother as well. The Undertaker denied all this; however, Bearer claimed to have proof in the form of The Undertaker's alive and well half-brother Kane, who had survived though scarred and burned. Bearer raised Kane after the fire, having him institutionalized from the date of the fire into adulthood. Ever since the fire, Kane had been awaiting to exact vengeance on his older half-brother. In defense, Undertaker responded that Kane, a pyromaniac, had been the one to set the fire and could not have possibly even survived. Also during the period, Bearer had unintentionally admitted to Undertaker's mother having an affair with him. As a result, it was revealed to The Undertaker that Kane was his half-brother. Until that point, Undertaker spent his life (the entirety of the father's life) under the impression that Kane was fully related to him and his family.

The Undertaker's final encounter with Michaels was in a casket match at the [[Royal Rumble (1998)|Royal Rumble]]. The week before on ''Raw'', Kane had seemed to ally with his brother against Michaels' [[D-Generation X]]; however, at the event, Kane trapped him in the coffin, padlocking the casket lid and setting it ablaze which again gave Michaels the victory.

During the match, The Undertaker threw Mankind off the roof of the {{convert|16|ft|m|abbr=on|disp=flip}} cell onto a broadcast table below, in what was a preplanned move. He later performed a chokeslam on Mankind through the roof of the cell into the ring which legitimately knocked Mankind unconscious. Mankind also used thumbtacks in the match and was hit by a [[Professional wrestling throws#Back body drop|back body drop]] and another chokeslam onto them before Undertaker won the match with the ''Tombstone Piledriver''.<ref name=pwi100 /> At [[Fully Loaded: In Your House]], The Undertaker and Stone Cold Steve Austin defeated Kane and Mankind to win the WWF World Tag Team Championship.<ref name=pwi100 /> The Undertaker and Austin's reign as [[World tag team championship|tag team champions]] lasted for only two weeks, as Kane and Mankind regained the titles on the August 10 episode of ''Raw''.{{cn|date=December 2019}} The Undertaker then became the number one contender for the renamed WWF Championship at [[SummerSlam (1998)|SummerSlam]], now held by Austin. Shortly before SummerSlam, however, The Undertaker revealed that he and Kane were working together as brothers. Despite this revelation, The Undertaker told Kane that he did not want him to interfere in the match with Austin and even though The Undertaker lost the match, he handed Austin his [[Championship belt#Professional wrestling|championship belt]] back after the match in a show of respect.<ref name=pwi100 /> In September, the storyline continued and The Undertaker began to show some villainous characteristics when he and Kane revealed the fact that they were in cahoots to rid Austin of his title for Mr. McMahon. At [[Breakdown: In Your House]], The Undertaker and Kane were booked in a [[Professional wrestling match types#Basic non-elimination matches|triple threat match]] with Austin for the WWF Championship, in which McMahon stated that the brothers were not allowed to pin each other. The Undertaker and Kane pinned Austin simultaneously after a [[Chokeslam#Double chokeslam|double chokeslam]], so the title was vacated by McMahon.<ref name=pwi100 /> This event led to a match at [[Judgment Day: In Your House]] between The Undertaker and Kane for the title, with Austin as the special guest referee. Near the end of the match, Paul Bearer seemed about to assist Kane by handing him a steel chair to hit The Undertaker with, but as Kane had his back turned, both Bearer and The Undertaker hit Kane with the chair. The Undertaker went for the pin, but Austin refused to count the fall, attacked The Undertaker and counted out both of them.<ref name=pwi100 /> Finally, The Undertaker became a villain the next night on ''Raw'' for the first time in over six years, reconciling with Bearer and claiming that he and Bearer would unleash their \"[[The Ministry of Darkness|Ministry of Darkness]]\" on the World Wrestling Federation. As part of this new storyline, he admitted that he had indeed set the fire that killed his parents, for which he had previously blamed Kane.{{cn|date=December 2019}}\n\n==== Ministry of Darkness (1998\u20131999) ====\n{{Main|Ministry of Darkness}}\nAfter [[Survivor Series (1998)|Survivor Series]], The Undertaker returned his attention to his previous feud with Austin for costing him the title at Judgment Day, hitting Austin in the head with a shovel during a title match with [[Dwayne Johnson|The Rock]], returning the favor for what happened a month earlier. With this twist in the storyline, Mr. McMahon scheduled a Buried Alive match between The Undertaker and Austin at [[Rock Bottom: In Your House]]. In the weeks leading up to Rock Bottom, The Undertaker attempted to embalm Austin alive, tried to have Kane committed to a [[Psychiatric hospital|mental asylum]] and had his druids chain Austin to his symbol, raising it high into the arena.{{cn|date=December 2019}} However, The Undertaker lost the match after Kane interfered.<ref name=pwi102>2007 Wrestling almanac & book of facts. \"Wrestling's historical cards\" (p. 102).</ref>\n\nAfter building up to his second villainous run in the latter part of 1998, The Undertaker introduced an updated version of his Deadman identity by January 1999 \u2013 the dark priest who in the initial period of this persona reigned over a stable known as The Ministry of Darkness. In this form, he took on a wicked, demonic presence, much more so than ever before. He often claimed to be invoking and taking orders from a \"Higher Power\". Moreover, he often appeared in a hooded black robe and sat on a throne that was specially designed into his character symbol. With the help of his minions, he often performed sacrifices on select WWF wrestlers, using various [[incantation]]s and [[magic word]]s with intent to extract out the dark side of the wrestlers in question to recruit them into his Ministry. The completed Ministry of Darkness consisted of [[The Brood (professional wrestling)|The Brood]] ([[Christian Cage|Christian]], [[Edge (wrestler)|Edge]] and [[Gangrel (wrestler)|Gangrel]]), [[Acolytes Protection Agency|The Acolytes]] (Bradshaw and [[Ron Simmons|Faarooq]]), [[Dennis Knight|Mideon]] and [[Viscera (wrestler)|Viscera]]. Calaway himself did not wrestle for a period having undergone a hip replacement. As part of the [[Glossary of professional wrestling terms#Angle|angle]], Undertaker expressed a desire to take control of the World Wrestling Federation, displacing its owner, Mr. McMahon. These ambitions culminated into a rivalry between The Ministry and [[The Corporation (professional wrestling)|The Corporation]], ultimately resulting in a match between Undertaker and Corporation enforcer, [[Big Boss Man (wrestler)|Big Boss Man]].

After their victory at [[SummerSlam (1999)|SummerSlam]], The Undertaker suffered a groin tear and was seen [[limp]]ing in several matches. He avoided competing in wrestling matches in the following weeks, instead tyrannically ordering Big Show to fight all his battles and oblige all his many wishes. He also began to transition away to the biker character he would play in 2000. Per an interview with Kevin Nash, this was a move to allow Calaway to enter World Championship Wrestling with a non-trademarked persona. Had he entered WCW, it would have been as Mark Calaway. Although negotiations were described as close, he ultimately re-signed with the World Wrestling Federation.{{cn|date=December 2019}}\n\nTo compensate for his lack of physical activity, Undertaker became more vocal on the mic, often making [[Know-it-all|smart-aleck]] remarks and performing commentary.

At the event, the two fought in a secluded rural locale, in a cinematic narrative-heavy event, rather than a traditional wrestling match. Despite the assistance of [[Gallows and Anderson]], The Undertaker would bury Styles in an empty grave to win the match. The match was noticeable for being the first time since 2003 where The Undertaker performed in the American Bad Ass persona rather than that of the Deadman, arriving to the field of battle on a motorcycle and accompanied by metal music.<ref name=\"WM36Part1\"/>\n\n==Professional wrestling style and persona==\nThe original Deadman character depicted him as a [[Western (genre)|Western]] [[Funeral director|mortician]] dressed in a [[trench coat]], gray-striped tie and gray-ringed, black [[stetson hat]] with gray gloves and [[Spats (footwear)|boot spats]]. He was portrayed as impervious to pain, something accomplished by Calaway [[Glossary of professional wrestling terms#No-sell|not selling]] his opponents' attacks. He was managed by Paul Bearer, who used an urn to give Undertaker supernatural powers. During his early years, he used the Funeral March by Chopin as his entrance theme. WWF composer Jim Johnson changed the Chopin march to create a new theme, the Graveyard Symphony.<ref>https://superluchas.com/jim-johnston-habla-del-proceso-tras-el-tema-de-entrada-de-the-undertaker/</ref>\n\nWhen he made his return in 2000, he abandoned the somber mortician-themed attires, his [[Funeral march|funeral dirge ring music]], allusions to the supernatural and the accompanying morbid theatrics. In place of this, he took on a biker identity, riding to the ring on a motorcycle and wearing sunglasses and bandanas to the ring. His [[Music in professional wrestling|entrance music]] was replaced with popular rock songs of the time, like [[Limp Bizkit]]'s \"[[Rollin' (Air Raid Vehicle)]]\" and [[Kid Rock]]'s \"[[American Bad Ass]]\" (from which the name of The Undertaker's new gimmick originated), though it was accompanied by the characteristic opening bell of The Undertaker's original theme.\n\nIn 2020, Undertaker started a feud with AJ Styles. Styles claimed that, in the last months, Undertaker lost his mystique because he broke kayfabe in social media and shoot interviews. At WrestleMania 36, Undertaker presented a new character called \"The Unholy Trinity\", a mix of the supernatural, the American Bad Ass characters and the real-life person.<ref>https://solowrestling.mundodeportivo.com/new/88886-undertaker-boneyard-match-por-mi-lo-hubiera-dejado-como-buried-alived</ref>\n\n== Legacy and reception ==\n[[File:Undertaker with Fire.jpg|thumb|The Undertaker in 2008]]\nThe Undertaker has been named one of the greatest wrestlers of all time.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.skysports.com/wwe/news/14203/11516978/wwe-analysis-is-the-undertaker-the-greatest-of-all-time|title=WWE Analysis: Is The Undertaker the greatest of all time?|website=Sky Sports}}</ref> The Undertaker was voted the greatest WWE wrestler ever in a 2013 [[Digital Spy]] poll.<ref>{{cite web|title=The Undertaker voted greatest WWE Superstar of all time|url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/ustv/s216/wwe/news/a482978/the-undertaker-voted-greatest-wwe-superstar-of-all-time.html#~plW3SSuMcxWtpS|publisher=Digital Spy UK|accessdate=August 21, 2015|date=May 20, 2013}}</ref> In naming him the second greatest wrestler ever, [[IGN]] described The Undertaker as, \"one of the most respected wrestlers, and characters, in the business; treated with actual reverence.

The year saw a number of celebrations of the law school's new home, including a filming of ''[[Today (NBC program)|The Today Show]]'' (then hosted by [[Barbara Walters]]) and appearances by Chief Justice [[Earl Warren]], Governor (and later Vice President) [[Nelson Rockefeller]] and Secretary-General of the United Nations [[Dag Hammarskj\u00f6ld]].<ref name=\"law.uchicago.edu\">[http://www.law.uchicago.edu/alumni/magazine/fall09/building Building a Future on a Strong Foundation | University of Chicago Law School].

She first came to public notice as a [[Blonde stereotype#Blondebombshell|blonde bombshell]] in the style of American [[Marilyn Monroe]], as promoted by her first husband, Dennis Hamilton, mostly via sex film-comedies and risqu\u00e9 modelling. After it turned out that Hamilton had been defrauding her, she continued to play up to her established image, and she made [[Tabloid (newspaper format)|tabloid]] headlines with the parties reportedly held at her house. Later, she showed a genuine talent as a performer on TV, in recordings, and in [[cabaret]], and gained new popularity as a regular chat-show guest. She also gave some well-regarded performances in worthwhile films at different points in her career.\n\nAccording to [[David Thomson (film critic)|David Thomson]], \"Dors represented that period between the end of the [[World War II|war]] and the coming of [[Lady Chatterley's Lover|Lady Chatterley]] in paperback, a time when sexuality was naughty, repressed and fit to burst.\" <ref>FILM STUDIES: She could have been a contender.

Hamilton had steered the company toward the dual purpose of publicising his wife and helping himself, overpaying tax bills and establishing financial stability.<ref name=DDStar5/>\n\nHaving been forced by Hamilton to sign over all of her assets on their separation, and in need of money to pay her divorce lawyers and their accountants, she agreed to the suggestion of agent Joseph Collins to undertake a theatre-based cabaret tour titled \"The Diana Dors Show\".\n\nYeardye suggested that they hire the comedian Dickie Dawson, later known as [[Richard Dawson]]. Dawson subsequently scripted the show and wrote most of the material. Dors started a relationship with Dawson and ended the relationship with Yeardye, who subsequently emptied her cash box at [[Harrods]] of \u00a318,000 and sold his story to the media.<ref name=Bret/> This brought negative publicity to the show, but audience numbers remained high, which allowed Dors extra time to explain her affairs to a subsequent [[Inland Revenue]] investigation of her cash holdings.<ref name=DDStar5>{{cite web|url=http://www.dianadors.co.uk/1_the_star_5_36.html|title=The Diana Dors Story -The Star 5|work=dianadors.co.uk}}</ref> In 1959, Hamilton died, and Dors married Dawson in New York while making an appearance on ''[[The Steve Allen Show]]''. \"The Diana Dors Show\" was commissioned for two studio-based series on television at [[ITV (TV network)|ITV]].<ref name=Bret/>\n\n===Hollywood once more===\nAfter the birth of her first child in February 1960, and wishing to stay in the United States with Dawson, Dors undertook a cabaret contract to headline at the [[Dunes (hotel and casino)|Dunes hotel and casino]] in Las Vegas.<ref name=Bret/>\n\nShe appeared in some American films: ''[[On the Double (film)|On the Double]]'' (1961), a [[Danny Kaye]] comedy, and ''[[The Big Bankroll]]'' (1962), a crime film also known as ''King of the Roaring 20's: The Story of Arnold Rothstein''.

In 1961 she narrowly escaped death at a [[Guy Fawkes Night]] party in [[Wraysbury]] where fireworks were accidentally ignited indoors.

She became a regular on ''[[Jokers Wild (TV series)|Jokers Wild]]'', ''[[Blankety Blank]]'' and ''[[Celebrity Squares]]'', and was a regular guest on [[BBC Radio 2]]'s ''The Law Game''.

In 1960 she wrote and published ''Swingin' Dors'' and between 1978 and 1984, she published four autobiographical books under her own name: ''For Adults Only'', ''Behind Closed Dors'', ''Dors by Diana'', and ''A. to Z. of Men''.\n\nDiana Dors was the subject of ''[[This Is Your Life (UK TV series)|This Is Your Life]]'' on two occasions, in April 1957 when she was surprised by [[Eamonn Andrews]] at the BBC Television Theatre, and in October 1982, when Andrews surprised her at London's Royalty Theatre.\n\nHaving gone through her first round of cancer treatment, by the early 1980s Dors' hour-glass figure had become plumper, and she addressed the issue through co-authoring a diet book,<ref>{{cite book|title=X-Cel diet|author=Diana Dors & Michael Waterfield|publisher=Julian P.|date=May 1983|isbn=0-901943-20-7}}</ref> and creating a diet and exercise [[videocassette]]. This resulted in her working for [[TV-am]], ITV's breakfast station, in the summer of 1983, in a regular slot focusing on diet and nutrition, which later developed into an [[Advice column|agony aunt]] segment. As the cancer treatment took its toll again, though, her appearances became less frequent.<ref name=DDTwilight>{{cite web|url=http://www.dianadors.co.uk/twilight_years_13.html|title=The Diana Dors Story &ndash; Twilight Years|work=dianadors.co.uk}}</ref>  She sued the show for withholding her fan mail.<ref>Diana Dors in row over TV-am 'fan mail', Barker, Dennis.

The tracks were \"I Feel So Mmmm\" and \"A Kiss and a Cuddle (and a Few Kind Words From You)\". HMV also released sheet music featuring sultry photos of Dors on the cover. She also sang \"The Hokey Pokey Polka\" on the 1954 soundtrack for the film ''As Long As They're Happy''.\n\nDors recorded only one complete album, the [[Swing music|swing]]-themed ''Swingin' Dors'', in 1960. The LP was originally released on red vinyl and with a gatefold sleeve. The accompanying orchestra was conducted by [[Angela Morley|Wally Stott]].\n\nShe also sang as a special guest for the Italian TV show ''Un, due, tre'' (''One, two, three'', starring [[Ugo Tognazzi]] and [[Raimondo Vianello]]) on 31 May 1959, at the Teatro della Fiera in [[Milan]], with orchestra conducted by Mario Bertolazzi and recorded singles on various record labels from the 1960s through the early 1980s, including a single for the Nomis label, \"[[Where Did They Go]]?\" / \"It's You Again\" (the latter being a duet with her son, Gary Dawson), while she was battling cancer. While promoting the single on TV, Dors claimed \"Where Did They Go?\" had been especially written for her, but in fact, the track had been recorded originally by [[Peggy Lee]] in 1971 and in 1972 by [[Sandie Shaw]].\n\n===Studio albums===\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|- bgcolor=\"#CCCCC\"\n!

During the short relationship, Dors became pregnant, but Caborn-Waterfield paid for a back-street abortion, which took place on a kitchen table in [[Battersea]]. The relationship continued for a time, before Dors met Dennis Hamilton Gittins on the set of ''Lady Godiva Rides Again'', with whom she had a second abortion in 1951.<ref name=DDStar2>{{cite web|url=http://www.dianadors.co.uk/1_the_star_2_33.html|title=The Diana Dors Story &ndash; The Star 2|work=dianadors.co.uk}}</ref>\n\nIt is said that Dors became a close friend of [[Ruth Ellis]], the last woman to be hanged in Britain, after Ellis had a bit part in ''Lady Godiva Rides Again'', four years before she was executed by [[Albert Pierrepoint]], having admitted to and been found guilty of shooting her lover. However Diana never mentioned having known Ruth either in interviews or in her memoirs. Through her husband Hamilton, Dors was close friends with the notorious [[Kray twins]] and their mother Violet.<ref name=Bret/>\n\n===Parties===\nDuring her relationship with Hamilton and until a few months before her death, Dors regularly held adult parties at her home. There, a number of celebrities, amply supplied with alcohol and drugs, mixed with young starlets against a background of both softcore and hardcore porn films.<ref name=Bret>{{cite book|title=Diana Dors: Hurricane In Mink|author=David Bret|date=October 2010|publisher=JR Books, London|isbn=978-1-907532-10-8 }}</ref><!--There seems to be some disagreement about the date of publication--> Dors gave all her guests full access to the entire house; her son Jason Lake later alleged in various media interviews and publications that she had equipped it with [[8 mm film|8 mm movie cameras]].

23 October 1931{{spaced ndash}}4 May 1984) was an English film actress and singer. She first came to public notice as a [[Blonde stereotype#Blondebombshell|blonde bombshell]] in the style of American [[Marilyn Monroe]], as promoted by her first husband, Dennis Hamilton, mostly via sex film-comedies and risqu\u00e9 modelling. After it turned out that Hamilton had been defrauding her, she continued to play up to her established image, and she made [[Tabloid (newspaper format)|tabloid]] headlines with the parties reportedly held at her house. Later, she showed a genuine talent as a performer on TV, in recordings, and in [[cabaret]], and gained new popularity as a regular chat-show guest. She also gave some well-regarded performances in worthwhile films at different points in her career.\n\nAccording to [[David Thomson (film critic)|David Thomson]], \"Dors represented that period between the end of the [[World War II|war]] and the coming of [[Lady Chatterley's Lover|Lady Chatterley]] in paperback, a time when sexuality was naughty, repressed and fit to burst.\" <ref>FILM STUDIES: She could have been a contender.

While promoting the single on TV, Dors claimed \"Where Did They Go?\" had been especially written for her, but in fact, the track had been recorded originally by [[Peggy Lee]] in 1971 and in 1972 by [[Sandie Shaw]].\n\n===Studio albums===\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|- bgcolor=\"#CCCCC\"\n!
