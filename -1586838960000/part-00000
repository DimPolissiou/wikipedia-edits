Additionally, the organization presents the medical dangers resulting from abortion, stories of women who had an abortion and later regretted it, and stories of women who planned to have an abortion but ultimately did not.\n\nSince the beginning of the 21st century, the organization has concentrated on providing financial support to pregnant women who plan on having an abortion due to their economic situation.\n\nThe organization's approach is illustrated by the following, quoted from Efrat's website:\n\n<blockquote>What is an abortion? Abortion means ending the life of child who is not sufficiently developed to survive outside its mother\u2019s womb.\n\nAlthough the vast majority of abortions are performed on socio-economic grounds, an abortion does not resolve financial or social difficulties.

On television and radio broadcasts, Betty Crocker was portrayed by several actresses, on radio by [[Marjorie Husted]] for twenty years, and on television by [[Adelaide Hawley Cumming]] between 1949 and 1964.\n\nThe character was developed in 1920 as a way to give a personalized response to consumer product questions.

It was the country's first radio cooking program. Blanche Ingersoll followed by Husted were selected to portray Betty Crocker.

By 1932, this scheme had become so popular that General Mills began to offer an entire set of flatware; the pattern was called \"Friendship\" (later renamed \"Medality\"). In 1937, the coupons were printed on the outside of packages, copy on which told purchasers to \"save and redeem for huge savings on fine kitchen and home accessories in our [[mail-order catalog|catalog]]\".\n\n==Cookbook publications ==\nFrom 1930, General Mills issued softbound recipe books, including in 1933 ''Betty Crocker's 101 Delicious [[Bisquick]] Creations, As Made and Served by Well-Known Gracious Hostesses, Famous Chefs, Distinguished Epicures and Smart Luminaries of Movieland.''{{citation needed|date = January 2012}}\n\n1941\u20131945: The ''Betty Crocker Cook Book of All-Purpose Baking'' was published as an aid to wartime considerations in cooking.<ref>{{cite web|last=Jarvits|first=Janet|title=Betty Crocker Edition History|url=http://www.cookbookjj.com/college/betty_crocker.htm|publisher=General Mills}}</ref>\n\nIn 1950, the ''Betty Crocker Picture Cookbook'' was published.

She returns to her home in [[Newfoundland]] to investigate evidence that Newfoundland\u2019s 1949 entry into Canada was a conspiracy. Following the death of a politician, whose papers contain evidence, she begins to believe that the referendum results were faked, with British spies helping the cause.\n\nThis film was produced for nearly $2 million, with $1.8 million provided by First Choice and [[Canadian Broadcasting Corporation|CBC]]. The film was invited to New York City\u2019s [[Museum of Modern Art]], and screened as part of the This Film is From Canada Series.\n\n== Plot ==\n\nThe film opens with the death of the elderly and wealthy Leo Cryptus (Denys Ferry), the Chief Returning Officer for the 1948 confederation referenda. The film then shifts to [[Montreal]], introducing Frieda Vokey, a graduate student of [[McGill University]] completing her history thesis on confederation titled \u201cthe decline of the sovereign Newfoundland state\u201d. After academic advisors in Montreal tell Frieda that her thesis is a \u201cjoke\u201d she then returns to her hometown of [[St. John\u2019s, Newfoundland]].\n\nFrieda is greeted by her mother, Oona ([[Mary Walsh (actress)|Mary Walsh]]), with whom she strikes up a womanly conversation. Upon arrival to her home, Frieda is welcomed by her brother Chris ([[Rick Mercer]]) and Frieda begins a heated discussion with her father, Lester, a private advisor to Premier Valentine Aylward ([[Andy Jones (comedian)|Andy Jones]]) about seeing Joey Smallwood (Kevin Noble) before his death.\n\nWhile paying her respects for the Cryptus family, Frieda is introduced to Michael Cryptus (G\u00e9za Kov\u00e1cs), son of Leo Cryptus. Frieda is then warned by Dr. Furey (Brian Hennessey) that Newfoundland is not the best place to study Newfoundland history because the people here are still very involved with Newfoundland history.\n\nFrieda intends on meeting a local Newfoundland journalist, Daniel Maddox ([[Ron Hynes]]), about discussing her thesis paper. Upon this meeting, Dan suggests that Frieda come to his home for dinner and further discussion of her thesis. Following dinner, Frieda stays later than expected, sneaking into Dan\u2019s office finding classified information regarding records of cheques sent to the British that were declined, and also letters sent to Dan declining his request for more information about the apparent conspiracy surrounding Newfoundland\u2019s joining of confederation. Dan then awakens to find Frieda has left his home, but his belongings have been searched. Both Frieda and Dan are later involved in an interview over the radio, in which Frieda discusses her findings discovered in Dan\u2019s office. Frieda continues her investigation, after the interview, meeting with Michael, believing he has the information she is looking for regarding his father and the confederation conspiracy. Michael informs Frieda he knows nothing of this and becomes worried that his father was a political monster.\n\nFrieda\u2019s father later decides to help bringing her to an archive containing information on confederation. Frieda questions her father about British spies who helped the apparent scam. Her father states that he has no knowledge on that situation. Frieda then meets with Mr. Joey Smallwood at the hospital, she extensively questions him but he is not willing to speak to her because of his illness.\n\nWhile attending a benefit banquet, Frieda\u2019s brother Chris steals the keys from a key holder for the public record office containing secret and potentially damaging files about confederation. Chris gives the keys to Frieda. She then leaves the banquet, sneaks into the office and begins investigating the files. She finds cheque receipts issued to her father, Lester. Two men, along with the key holder, Doris ([[Mary Lewis]]), and Dan arrive at the building requesting to see the files because they believe the files are being tampered with. Frieda hears footsteps coming and escapes unnoticed.\n\nWhile on her way home, Premier Valentine presents Frieda with more files.

She returns to her home in [[Newfoundland]] to investigate evidence that Newfoundland\u2019s 1949 entry into Canada was a conspiracy. Following the death of a politician, whose papers contain evidence, she begins to believe that the referendum results were faked, with British spies helping the cause.\n\nThis film was produced for nearly $2 million, with $1.8 million provided by First Choice and [[Canadian Broadcasting Corporation|CBC]]. The film was invited to New York City\u2019s [[Museum of Modern Art]], and screened as part of the This Film is From Canada Series.\n\n== Plot ==\n\nThe film opens with the death of the elderly and wealthy Leo Cryptus (Denys Ferry), the Chief Returning Officer for the 1948 confederation referenda. The film then shifts to [[Montreal]], introducing Frieda Vokey, a graduate student of [[McGill University]] completing her history thesis on confederation titled \u201cthe decline of the sovereign Newfoundland state\u201d. After academic advisors in Montreal tell Frieda that her thesis is a \u201cjoke\u201d she then returns to her hometown of [[St. John\u2019s, Newfoundland]].\n\nFrieda is greeted by her mother, Oona ([[Mary Walsh (actress)|Mary Walsh]]), with whom she strikes up a womanly conversation. Upon arrival to her home, Frieda is welcomed by her brother Chris ([[Rick Mercer]]) and Frieda begins a heated discussion with her father, Lester, a private advisor to Premier Valentine Aylward ([[Andy Jones (comedian)|Andy Jones]]) about seeing Joey Smallwood (Kevin Noble) before his death.\n\nWhile paying her respects for the Cryptus family, Frieda is introduced to Michael Cryptus (G\u00e9za Kov\u00e1cs), son of Leo Cryptus. Frieda is then warned by Dr. Furey (Brian Hennessey) that Newfoundland is not the best place to study Newfoundland history because the people here are still very involved with Newfoundland history.\n\nFrieda intends on meeting a local Newfoundland journalist, Daniel Maddox ([[Ron Hynes]]), about discussing her thesis paper. Upon this meeting, Dan suggests that Frieda come to his home for dinner and further discussion of her thesis. Following dinner, Frieda stays later than expected, sneaking into Dan\u2019s office finding classified information regarding records of cheques sent to the British that were declined, and also letters sent to Dan declining his request for more information about the apparent conspiracy surrounding Newfoundland\u2019s joining of confederation. Dan then awakens to find Frieda has left his home, but his belongings have been searched. Both Frieda and Dan are later involved in an interview over the radio, in which Frieda discusses her findings discovered in Dan\u2019s office. Frieda continues her investigation, after the interview, meeting with Michael, believing he has the information she is looking for regarding his father and the confederation conspiracy. Michael informs Frieda he knows nothing of this and becomes worried that his father was a political monster.\n\nFrieda\u2019s father later decides to help bringing her to an archive containing information on confederation. Frieda questions her father about British spies who helped the apparent scam. Her father states that he has no knowledge on that situation. Frieda then meets with Mr. Joey Smallwood at the hospital, she extensively questions him but he is not willing to speak to her because of his illness.\n\nWhile attending a benefit banquet, Frieda\u2019s brother Chris steals the keys from a key holder for the public record office containing secret and potentially damaging files about confederation. Chris gives the keys to Frieda. She then leaves the banquet, sneaks into the office and begins investigating the files. She finds cheque receipts issued to her father, Lester. Two men, along with the key holder, Doris ([[Mary Lewis]]), and Dan arrive at the building requesting to see the files because they believe the files are being tampered with. Frieda hears footsteps coming and escapes unnoticed.\n\nWhile on her way home, Premier Valentine presents Frieda with more files. When she arrives home she confronts her father about the issued cheques, where he shows her the un-cashed cheques, and admits to working with the British in helping the confederation cause.

It was the creation of [[George Lyttelton, 1st Baron Lyttelton|George, 1st Lord Lyttelton]] (1709\u20131773), secretary to [[Frederick, Prince of Wales]], poet and man of letters and briefly [[Chancellor of the Exchequer]]. Before the death of his father ([[Sir Thomas Lyttelton, 4th Baronet|Sir Thomas Lyttelton]]) in 1751, he began to landscape the grounds in the new [[Picturesque]] style, and between 1754 and 1760 it was he who was responsible for the building of the [[Neo-Palladian]] house that survives to this day.\n\nAfter a fire in 1925, most of the house was restored, but the uppermost floor of the servants' quarters was not, which means that the present roof line between the towers is lower than it was when first constructed.\n\nThe estate fell into disrepair and incurred a mounting debt beginning in the 1970s. The [[John Lyttelton, 11th Viscount Cobham|11th Viscount Cobham]] was forced to sell off large tracts of estate land to keep it afloat (in addition to paying for his high-profile divorce). His brother and successor [[Christopher Charles Lyttelton, 12th Viscount Cobham]] began restoration works in both the main house and the park.<ref>{{harvnb|Crow|2013}}; {{harvnb|Pullen|2014}}</ref> The park is open to the public and part of the house is available as a venue for hire.\n\n{{As of|2012}}, the hall is the family home to [[Christopher Charles Lyttelton, 12th Viscount Cobham]] and his wife Tessa.\n\n==House==\nThe fashion for [[Neo-Palladian]] houses had started in London between 1715 and 1720.

The [[John Lyttelton, 11th Viscount Cobham|11th Viscount Cobham]] was forced to sell off large tracts of estate land to keep it afloat (in addition to paying for his high-profile divorce).

The engineer, William Rockefeller, later admitted that before reaching the curve he had gone into a \"daze\", a sort of [[highway hypnosis]].\n\nThe leader of the [[National Transportation Safety Board]] (NTSB) team investigating said it was likely that the accident would have been prevented had [[positive train control]] (PTC) been installed per a prior federal mandate requiring its installation by 2015. Due to a number of other recent accidents involving Metro-North trains and tracks, the [[Federal Railroad Administration]] (FRA) demanded improved safety measures, which Metro-North began implementing within a week of the accident.\n\nIn late 2014, almost a year after the accident, the NTSB released its final report on the accident. After reiterating its earlier conclusion that PTC would have prevented the accident entirely, it found the most direct cause was Rockefeller's inattention as the train entered the curve. There were other contributing factors. A medical examination following the accident diagnosed [[sleep apnea]], which had hampered his ability to fully adjust his sleep patterns to the morning shift which he had begun working two weeks earlier. The report faulted both Metro-North for not screening its employees in sensitive positions for [[sleep disorder]]s, and the FRA for not requiring railroads to do such screening.<ref name=\"NTSB brief\" />\n\n=={{anchor|Train}}Background==\n\nThe train involved in the accident was the second southbound [[Hudson Line (Metro-North)|Hudson Line]] train of the day, leaving [[Poughkeepsie (Metro-North station)|Poughkeepsie]], the line's northern terminus, at its scheduled departure time of 5:54&nbsp;a.m. [[Eastern Standard Time (North America)|EST]].<ref name=\"current Metro-North schedule\">[[Metropolitan Transportation Authority]], {{cite web|url= http://web.mta.info/mnr/html/planning/schedules/pdf/NOV172013HUD-SS.pdf |title=Hudson Line weekend schedule|publisher=[[Metropolitan Transportation Authority]]|date= November 17, 2013|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131216041718/http://www.mta.info/mnr/html/planning/schedules/pdf/NOV172013HUD-SS.pdf|archivedate=December 16, 2013|accessdate=April 13, 2020}}</ref> It was powered by a [[GE Genesis|GE P32AC-DM]] [[dual-mode locomotive|locomotive]],<ref name=\"Rockefeller interview transcript\">{{cite web|title=Transcript of Interview 8808 Engineer|url=http://dms.ntsb.gov/public%2F55500-55999%2F55841%2F551511.pdf|publisher=[[National Transportation Safety Board]]|page=48|date=December 3, 2013|accessdate=October 31, 2014}}</ref> capable of running on either diesel fuel or electricity from a [[third rail]].

After a [[2008 Chatsworth train collision|2008 wreck]] in [[Los Angeles, California|Los Angeles]], the FRA mandated all American railroads implement PTC by 2015. Many resisted, complaining about the cost of the technology. Among those railroads were both MTA commuter railroads, Metro-North and the [[Long Island Rail Road]], which have sought to have that deadline extended until 2018. In the wake of the Spuyten Duyvil derailment, U.S. Rep. [[Sean Patrick Maloney]], a resident of [[Cold Spring, New York|Cold Spring]] whose neighbor James Lovell was one of those killed, introduced legislation to make low-interest loans and guarantees available so that commuter railroads like Metro-North could implement PTC.<ref name=\"FRA letter story\" /> Eventually other congressmembers from the lower Hudson Valley joined as cosponsors.<ref name=\"Journal News Deep Dive story\">{{cite news|last=Juva-Brown|first=Theresa|title=Bronx derailment: Grants program pushed for Metro-North|url=http://www.lohud.com/article/20131215/NEWS/312150049/Bronx-derailment-Grants-program-pushed-Metro-North-|newspaper=[[The Journal News]]|date=December 15, 2013|accessdate=December 18, 2013}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Metro-North crew installing speed restriction sign.jpg|thumb|left|Metro-North crews install speed-restriction sign on a stretch of the [[New Haven Line]] two weeks after the Spuyten Duyvil accident|alt=Four men in reflectorized orange vests and neon green helmets standing next to a set of four railroad tracks installing a signpost next to the track.

Instead they pointed to doubts about the technology's efficacy for large commuter rail networks. On a radio talk show following the crash, New York Governor [[Andrew Cuomo]] conceded that PTC is \"controversial ... [some people say] it's not what it's cracked up to be.\" The MTA itself said it was \"untested and unproven for commuter railroads [of our] size and complexity.\"<ref name=\"NYT alerter story\" />\n\nSeveral days later ''[[The New York Times]]'' reported that the train had a device known as an [[cab signalling#Cab signalling in the United States|alerter]]. It sounds an alarm when the train exceeds speed limits for 25 seconds and shuts it down after an additional 15 seconds if no action is taken by the engineer. It might have been able to prevent the accident; however it was in the locomotive, at the rear of the train, not the cab where Rockefeller was located.<ref name=\"NYT alerter story\" />\n\nWhile Metro-North used it only to prevent collisions, rail safety experts said it could easily be configured to force trains to slow down at curves such as Spuyten Duyvil, since it relied on signals sent through the rails themselves. It was also preferable to the traditional [[dead man's switch]] the cab was equipped with, which requires constant action and attention from the engineer. The MTA said it was considering doing so at 30 sites on the Metro-North and LIRR networks.<ref name=\"NYT alerter story\" /> On December 6, the FRA issued an emergency order requiring Metro-North to have two qualified crew members in the cab at any point where the speed limit drops by more than {{convert|20|mph}} until it installs that technology in cabs and at those sites.<ref name=\"FRA mandate story\" /> The next day Metro-North announced it was upgrading the signals at the Spuyten Duyvil curve and several others in the system; it would also lower the speed limit going into the curve so that it would be a less-than-20-mph drop and thus the extra engineer would not be necessary.<ref name=\"MTA changes story\">{{cite news|title=Safety Upgrades Coming to Metro-North Derailment Site: MTA|url=http://www.nbcnewyork.com/news/local/Safety-Upgrades-MTA-Metro-North-Train-Derailment-Bronx-Spuyten-Duyvil-Curve-234987791.html|newspaper=[[WNBC-TV]]|date=December 8, 2013|accessdate=December 8, 2013}}</ref> U.S. Senators [[Richard Blumenthal]] of Connecticut and [[Charles Schumer]] of New York called on Metro-North to install cameras to monitor both the track and the engineers.<ref name=\"Senators call for cameras\">{{cite news|last=Castillo|first=Alfonso A.|title=Senators call for train cameras to monitor engineer, track|url=http://www.newsday.com/long-island/senators-call-for-train-cameras-to-monitor-engineer-track-1.6564959|newspaper=[[Newsday]]|date=December 8, 2013|accessdate=December 9, 2013}}</ref>\n\nOn December 12, the FRA went further.

A prior federal mandate required installation of the system by 2015. Due to a number of other recent accidents involving Metro-North trains and tracks, the [[Federal Railroad Administration]] (FRA) demanded improved safety measures, which Metro-North began implementing within a week of the accident.\n\nIn late 2014, almost a year after the accident, the NTSB released its final report on the accident. After reiterating its earlier conclusion that PTC would have prevented the accident entirely, it found the most direct cause was Rockefeller's inattention as the train entered the curve. There were other contributing factors. A medical examination following the accident diagnosed [[sleep apnea]], which had hampered his ability to fully adjust his sleep patterns to the morning shift which he had begun working two weeks earlier.

After a [[2008 Chatsworth train collision|2008 wreck]] in [[Los Angeles, California|Los Angeles]], the FRA mandated all American railroads implement PTC by 2015. Many resisted, complaining about the cost of the technology. Among those railroads were both MTA commuter railroads, Metro-North and the [[Long Island Rail Road]], which have sought to have that deadline extended until 2018. In the wake of the Spuyten Duyvil derailment, U.S. Rep. [[Sean Patrick Maloney]], a resident of [[Cold Spring, New York|Cold Spring]] whose neighbor James Lovell was one of those killed, introduced legislation to make low-interest loans and guarantees available so that commuter railroads like Metro-North could implement PTC.<ref name=\"FRA letter story\" /> Eventually other congressmembers from the lower Hudson Valley joined as cosponsors.<ref name=\"Journal News Deep Dive story\">{{cite news|last=Juva-Brown|first=Theresa|title=Bronx derailment: Grants program pushed for Metro-North|url=http://www.lohud.com/article/20131215/NEWS/312150049/Bronx-derailment-Grants-program-pushed-Metro-North-|newspaper=[[The Journal News]]|date=December 15, 2013|accessdate=December 18, 2013}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Metro-North crew installing speed restriction sign.jpg|thumb|left|Metro-North crews install speed-restriction sign on a stretch of the [[New Haven Line]] two weeks after the Spuyten Duyvil accident|alt=Four men in reflectorized orange vests and neon green helmets standing next to a set of four railroad tracks installing a signpost next to the track.

Instead they pointed to doubts about the technology's efficacy for large commuter rail networks. On a radio talk show following the crash, New York Governor [[Andrew Cuomo]] conceded that PTC is \"controversial ... [some people say] it's not what it's cracked up to be.\" The MTA itself said it was \"untested and unproven for commuter railroads [of our] size and complexity.\"<ref name=\"NYT alerter story\" />\n\nSeveral days later ''[[The New York Times]]'' reported that the train had a device known as an [[cab signalling#Cab signalling in the United States|alerter]]. It sounds an alarm when the train exceeds speed limits for 25 seconds and shuts it down after an additional 15 seconds if no action is taken by the engineer. It might have been able to prevent the accident; however it was in the locomotive, at the rear of the train, not the cab where Rockefeller was located.<ref name=\"NYT alerter story\" />\n\nWhile Metro-North used it only to prevent collisions, rail safety experts said it could easily be configured to force trains to slow down at curves such as Spuyten Duyvil, since it relied on signals sent through the rails themselves. It was also preferable to the traditional [[dead man's switch]] the cab was equipped with, which requires constant action and attention from the engineer. The MTA said it was considering doing so at 30 sites on the Metro-North and LIRR networks.<ref name=\"NYT alerter story\" /> On December 6, the FRA issued an emergency order requiring Metro-North to have two qualified crew members in the cab at any point where the speed limit drops by more than {{convert|20|mph}} until it installs that technology in cabs and at those sites.<ref name=\"FRA mandate story\" /> The next day Metro-North announced it was upgrading the signals at the Spuyten Duyvil curve and several others in the system; it would also lower the speed limit going into the curve so that it would be a less-than-20-mph drop and thus the extra engineer would not be necessary.<ref name=\"MTA changes story\">{{cite news|title=Safety Upgrades Coming to Metro-North Derailment Site: MTA|url=http://www.nbcnewyork.com/news/local/Safety-Upgrades-MTA-Metro-North-Train-Derailment-Bronx-Spuyten-Duyvil-Curve-234987791.html|newspaper=[[WNBC-TV]]|date=December 8, 2013|accessdate=December 8, 2013}}</ref> U.S. Senators [[Richard Blumenthal]] of Connecticut and [[Charles Schumer]] of New York called on Metro-North to install cameras to monitor both the track and the engineers.<ref name=\"Senators call for cameras\">{{cite news|last=Castillo|first=Alfonso A.|title=Senators call for train cameras to monitor engineer, track|url=http://www.newsday.com/long-island/senators-call-for-train-cameras-to-monitor-engineer-track-1.6564959|newspaper=[[Newsday]]|date=December 8, 2013|accessdate=December 9, 2013}}</ref>\n\nOn December 12, the FRA went further.
