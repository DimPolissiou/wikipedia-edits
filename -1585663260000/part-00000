Pheromones are used by most fully aquatic crabs, while [[terrestrial crab|terrestrial]] and semiterrestrial crabs often use visual signals, such as [[fiddler crab]] males waving their large claws to attract females. The vast number of brachyuran crabs have [[internal fertilisation]] and mate belly-to-belly. For many aquatic species, mating takes place just after the female has moulted and is still soft. Females can store the [[sperm]] for a long time before using it to fertilise their [[ovum|eggs]]. When fertilisation has taken place, the eggs are released onto the female's abdomen, below the tail flap, secured with a sticky material. In this location, they are protected during embryonic development. Females carrying eggs are called \"berried\" since the eggs resemble round berries.\n\nWhen development is complete, the female releases the newly hatched [[crustacean larvae|larvae]] into the water, where they are part of the [[plankton]]. The release is often timed with the [[tide]]s. The free-swimming tiny [[Zoea|zoea larvae]] can float and take advantage of water currents. They have a spine, which probably reduces the rate of predation by larger animals. The zoea of most species must find food, but some crabs provide enough [[Egg yolk|yolk]] in the eggs that the larval stages can continue to live off the yolk.\n[[File:Xantho poressa 2009 G1.jpg|thumb|right|Female crab ''[[Xantho poressa]]'' at spawning time in the [[Black Sea]], carrying eggs under her abdomen]]\n[[File:Grapsus tenuicrustatus - hawaii - 2015-11-01.webm|thumb|right|A [[grapsus|Grapsus tenuicrustatus]] climbing up a rock in [[Hawaii]]]]\n\nEach species has a particular number of zoeal stages, separated by [[Ecdysis|moults]], before they change into a [[megalopa]] stage, which resembles an adult crab, except for having the abdomen (tail) sticking out behind. After one more moult, the crab is a [[Juvenile (organism)|juvenile]], living on the bottom rather than floating in the water. This last moult, from megalopa to juvenile, is critical, and it must take place in a habitat that is suitable for the juvenile to survive.<ref name=\"Weis\">{{cite book |author=Judith S. Weis |year=2012 |title=Walking Sideways: The Remarkable World of Crabs |publisher=[[Cornell University Press]] |location=Ithaca, NY |isbn=978-0-8014-5050-1 |oclc=794640315}}</ref>{{rp|63\u201377}}\n\nMost species of terrestrial crabs must [[Animal migration|migrate]] down to the ocean to release their larvae; in some cases, this entails very extensive migrations. After living for a short time as larvae in the ocean, the juveniles must do this migration in reverse. In many tropical areas with land crabs, these migrations often result in considerable [[roadkill]] of migrating crabs.<ref name=\"Weis\"/>{{rp|113\u2013114}}\n\nOnce crabs have become juveniles, they will still have to keep moulting many more times to become adults. They are covered with a hard shell, which would otherwise prevent growth. The moult cycle is coordinated by [[hormone]]s. When preparing for moult, the old shell is softened and partly eroded away, while the rudimentary beginnings of a new shell form under it. At the time of moulting, the crab takes in a lot of water to expand and crack open the old shell at a line of weakness along the back edge of the [[carapace]]. The crab must then extract all of itself \u2013 including its legs, [[Arthropod mouthparts|mouthparts]], [[eyestalk]]s, and even the lining of the front and back of the digestive tract \u2013 from the old shell. This is a difficult process that takes many hours, and if a crab gets stuck, it will die. After freeing itself from the old shell (now called an [[exuvia]]), the crab is extremely soft and hides until its new shell has hardened. While the new shell is still soft, the crab can expand it to make room for future growth.<ref name=\"Weis\" />{{rp|78\u201379}}\n\n==Behaviour==\n[[File:Carpilius convexus is consuming Heterocentrotus trigonarius in Hawaii.jpg|left|thumb|''[[Carpilius convexus]]'' consuming ''[[Heterocentrotus trigonarius]]'' in Hawaii]]\nCrabs typically walk sideways<ref name=\"Sleinis\">{{cite journal |title=Locomotion in a forward walking crab |author1=Sally Sleinis |author2=Gerald E.

Some species are eaten whole, including the shell, such as [[soft-shell crab]]; with other species, just the claws or legs are eaten. The latter is particularly common for larger crabs, such as the [[snow crab]]. In many cultures the [[roe]] of the female crab is also eaten, which usually appears orange or yellow in fertile crabs. This is popular in southeast Asian cultures, some Mediterranean and northern European cultures, as well as on the eastern, [[Chesapeake Bay|Chesapeake]] and southern coasts of the United States.\n\nIn some regions, spices improve the culinary experience. In [[Southeast Asia]] and the [[Indosphere]], [[spice mix|masala]] crab and [[chilli crab]] are examples of heavily spiced dishes. In the [[Chesapeake Bay]] region, blue crab is often steamed with [[Old Bay Seasoning]]. Alaskan king crab or snow crab legs are usually simply boiled and served with garlic or lemon butter.\n\nFor the British dish [[Cancer pagurus#Cookery|dressed crab]], the [[crab meat]] is extracted and placed inside the hard shell. One American way to prepare crab meat is by extracting it and adding varying amounts of binders, such as egg white, cracker meal, mayonnaise or mustard, creating a [[crab cake]].  Crabs can also be made into a [[bisque (food)|bisque]], a global dish of French origin which in its authentic form includes in the broth the pulverized shells of the shellfish from which it is made.\n\n[[Crab stick|Imitation crab]], also called [[surimi]], is made from minced fish meat that is crafted and colored to resemble crab meat. While it is sometimes disdained among some elements of the culinary industry as an unacceptably low-quality substitute for real crab, this does not hinder its popularity, especially as a sushi ingredient in Japan and South Korea, and in home cooking, where cost is often a chief concern.<ref name=\"New York Times\">Daniel P.

Although many other groups have undergone similar processes, [[carcinisation]] is most advanced in crabs. The [[telson]] is no longer functional in crabs, and the [[uropod]]s are absent, having probably evolved into small devices for holding the reduced abdomen tight against the [[Sternum (arthropod)|sternum]].\n\nIn most decapods, the [[gonopore]]s (sexual openings) are found on the legs. However, since crabs use the first two pairs of [[pleopod]]s (abdominal appendages) for sperm transfer, this arrangement has changed. As the male abdomen evolved into a slimmer shape, the gonopores have moved towards the midline, away from the legs, and onto the sternum.<ref>{{cite journal |author=M. de Saint Laurent |year=1980 |title=Sur la classification et la phylog\u00e9nie des Crustac\u00e9s D\u00e9capodes Brachyoures.

Pheromones are used by most fully aquatic crabs, while [[terrestrial crab|terrestrial]] and semiterrestrial crabs often use visual signals, such as [[fiddler crab]] males waving their large claws to attract females. The vast number of brachyuran crabs have [[internal fertilisation]] and mate belly-to-belly. For many aquatic species, mating takes place just after the female has moulted and is still soft. Females can store the [[sperm]] for a long time before using it to fertilise their [[ovum|eggs]]. When fertilisation has taken place, the eggs are released onto the female's abdomen, below the tail flap, secured with a sticky material. In this location, they are protected during embryonic development. Females carrying eggs are called \"berried\" since the eggs resemble round berries.\n\nWhen development is complete, the female releases the newly hatched [[crustacean larvae|larvae]] into the water, where they are part of the [[plankton]]. The release is often timed with the [[tide]]s. The free-swimming tiny [[Zoea|zoea larvae]] can float and take advantage of water currents. They have a spine, which probably reduces the rate of predation by larger animals. The zoea of most species must find food, but some crabs provide enough [[Egg yolk|yolk]] in the eggs that the larval stages can continue to live off the yolk.\n[[File:Xantho poressa 2009 G1.jpg|thumb|right|Female crab ''[[Xantho poressa]]'' at spawning time in the [[Black Sea]], carrying eggs under her abdomen]]\n[[File:Grapsus tenuicrustatus - hawaii - 2015-11-01.webm|thumb|right|A [[grapsus|Grapsus tenuicrustatus]] climbing up a rock in [[Hawaii]]]]\n\nEach species has a particular number of zoeal stages, separated by [[Ecdysis|moults]], before they change into a [[megalopa]] stage, which resembles an adult crab, except for having the abdomen (tail) sticking out behind. After one more moult, the crab is a [[Juvenile (organism)|juvenile]], living on the bottom rather than floating in the water. This last moult, from megalopa to juvenile, is critical, and it must take place in a habitat that is suitable for the juvenile to survive.<ref name=\"Weis\">{{cite book |author=Judith S.

After living for a short time as larvae in the ocean, the juveniles must do this migration in reverse. In many tropical areas with land crabs, these migrations often result in considerable [[roadkill]] of migrating crabs.<ref name=\"Weis\"/>{{rp|113\u2013114}}\n\nOnce crabs have become juveniles, they will still have to keep moulting many more times to become adults. They are covered with a hard shell, which would otherwise prevent growth. The moult cycle is coordinated by [[hormone]]s. When preparing for moult, the old shell is softened and partly eroded away, while the rudimentary beginnings of a new shell form under it. At the time of moulting, the crab takes in a lot of water to expand and crack open the old shell at a line of weakness along the back edge of the [[carapace]]. The crab must then extract all of itself \u2013 including its legs, [[Arthropod mouthparts|mouthparts]], [[eyestalk]]s, and even the lining of the front and back of the digestive tract \u2013 from the old shell. This is a difficult process that takes many hours, and if a crab gets stuck, it will die. After freeing itself from the old shell (now called an [[exuvia]]), the crab is extremely soft and hides until its new shell has hardened. While the new shell is still soft, the crab can expand it to make room for future growth.<ref name=\"Weis\" />{{rp|78\u201379}}\n\n==Behaviour==\n[[File:Carpilius convexus is consuming Heterocentrotus trigonarius in Hawaii.jpg|left|thumb|''[[Carpilius convexus]]'' consuming ''[[Heterocentrotus trigonarius]]'' in Hawaii]]\nCrabs typically walk sideways<ref name=\"Sleinis\">{{cite journal |title=Locomotion in a forward walking crab |author1=Sally Sleinis |author2=Gerald E.

Some species are eaten whole, including the shell, such as [[soft-shell crab]]; with other species, just the claws or legs are eaten. The latter is particularly common for larger crabs, such as the [[snow crab]]. In many cultures the [[roe]] of the female crab is also eaten, which usually appears orange or yellow in fertile crabs. This is popular in southeast Asian cultures, some Mediterranean and northern European cultures, as well as on the eastern, [[Chesapeake Bay|Chesapeake]] and southern coasts of the United States.\n\nIn some regions, spices improve the culinary experience. In [[Southeast Asia]] and the [[Indosphere]], [[spice mix|masala]] crab and [[chilli crab]] are examples of heavily spiced dishes. In the [[Chesapeake Bay]] region, blue crab is often steamed with [[Old Bay Seasoning]]. Alaskan king crab or snow crab legs are usually simply boiled and served with garlic or lemon butter.\n\nFor the British dish [[Cancer pagurus#Cookery|dressed crab]], the [[crab meat]] is extracted and placed inside the hard shell. One American way to prepare crab meat is by extracting it and adding varying amounts of binders, such as egg white, cracker meal, mayonnaise or mustard, creating a [[crab cake]].  Crabs can also be made into a [[bisque (food)|bisque]], a global dish of French origin which in its authentic form includes in the broth the pulverized shells of the shellfish from which it is made.\n\n[[Crab stick|Imitation crab]], also called [[surimi]], is made from minced fish meat that is crafted and colored to resemble crab meat. While it is sometimes disdained among some elements of the culinary industry as an unacceptably low-quality substitute for real crab, this does not hinder its popularity, especially as a sushi ingredient in Japan and South Korea, and in home cooking, where cost is often a chief concern.<ref name=\"New York Times\">Daniel P.

Although many other groups have undergone similar processes, [[carcinisation]] is most advanced in crabs. The [[telson]] is no longer functional in crabs, and the [[uropod]]s are absent, having probably evolved into small devices for holding the reduced abdomen tight against the [[Sternum (arthropod)|sternum]].\n\nIn most decapods, the [[gonopore]]s (sexual openings) are found on the legs. However, since crabs use the first two pairs of [[pleopod]]s (abdominal appendages) for sperm transfer, this arrangement has changed. As the male abdomen evolved into a slimmer shape, the gonopores have moved towards the midline, away from the legs, and onto the sternum.<ref>{{cite journal |author=M. de Saint Laurent |year=1980 |title=Sur la classification et la phylog\u00e9nie des Crustac\u00e9s D\u00e9capodes Brachyoures.

The vast size of the [[Mediterranean]] and [[Middle East]] theatre saw interconnected naval, land, and air campaigns fought for control of the Mediterranean, [[North Africa]], the Horn of Africa, the Middle East and [[Southern Europe]]. The fighting in this theatre lasted from 10 June 1940, when [[Kingdom of Italy|Italy]] entered the war on the side of [[Nazi Germany|Germany]], until 2 May 1945 when all [[Axis powers|Axis forces]] in Italy surrendered. However, fighting would continue in [[Kingdom of Greece|Greece]] \u2013 where [[British Army|British troops]] had been dispatched to aid the [[Government of Greece|Greek government]] \u2013 during the early stages of the [[Greek Civil War]].\n\nThe British referred to this theatre as the Mediterranean and Middle East Theatre (so called due to the location of the fighting and the name of [[Middle East Command]]), the Americans called it the '''Mediterranean Theater of War''' and the German informal official history of the fighting is '''The Mediterranean, South-East Europe, and North Africa 1939\u20131941''' (1995). Regardless of the size of the theatre, the various campaigns were not seen as neatly separated areas of operations but part of a vast theatre of war.\n\n[[Kingdom of Italy#Fascist regime (1922\u20131943)|Fascist Italy]] aimed to carve out a new [[Roman Empire]], while [[British Armed Forces|British forces]] aimed initially to retain the status quo. Italy invaded Greece, and not until the introduction of German forces were Greece and [[Kingdom of Yugoslavia|Yugoslavia]] overrun. Allied and Axis forces engaged in back and forth fighting across North Africa, with Axis interference in the Middle East causing fighting to spread there. With confidence high from early gains, [[Wehrmacht|German forces]] planned elaborate attacks to be launched to capture the Middle East and then to possibly attack the southern border of the [[Soviet Union]]. In three years of fighting, Axis forces were defeated in North Africa and their interference in the Middle East was halted. The anti-Axis coalition then commenced the [[Allied invasion of Italy]], resulting in the Italians deposing [[Benito Mussolini|Mussolini]] and joining the Allies. A prolonged [[Italian Campaign (World War II)|battle for Italy]] took place between Allied and Axis forces. As the strategic situation changed in south-east Europe, British troops returned to Greece.\n\nThe theatre of war had the longest duration of the Second World War, resulted in the destruction of the [[Italian Empire]] and altered the strategic position of Germany, resulting in German divisions being deployed to Africa and Italy and total German losses (including those captured upon final surrender) being over two million.{{efn|While the fighting around the Mediterranean formed the longest fought over [[Theater (warfare)|theatre of war]] during the [[Second World War]], the [[Battle of the Atlantic]] was fought from 1939 to 1945, the war's longest continuous [[military campaign]].<ref>Blair (1996), p. xiii</ref><ref>Woodman (2004), p. 1</ref>}} Italian losses amounted to around 177,000 men with a further several hundred thousand captured during the process of the various campaigns.

The larger but poorly trained Iraqi force was defeated and Baghdad and [[Mosul]] were captured. Ali and his supporters fled the country and an [[armistice]] was signed, restoring the monarchy of Faisal II, the [[Kingdom of Iraq]] and a pro-British government. The defeat of the rebellion saw the defeat of the German-Italian attempt to entrench an Axis state in Iraq and worsened relations between the UK and Vichy France, culminating in the [[Syria-Lebanon Campaign]].<ref name=O5 />\n\n=== Operation Exporter ===\n{{Main|Syria\u2013Lebanon Campaign}}\nIn Operation Exporter, Australian, [[Free French]], British and Indian units invaded Syria and Lebanon from Palestine in the south on 8 June 1941. Vigorous resistance was met from the Vichy French but superior Allied training, equipment and numbers overwhelmed the defenders. More attacks were launched at the end of June and early July from Iraq into northern and central Syria, by [[Iraqforce]]. By 8 July, north-east Syria had been captured and elements of Iraqforce had advanced up the river Euphrates towards [[Aleppo]], the rear of the Vichy forces defending Beirut from the advance from the south.

The territory provided a strongly defended harbour, from which ships could operate in the Atlantic and the Mediterranean. [[Force H]] ([[Vice-Admiral]] [[James Fownes Somerville|James Somerville]]) was based in Gibraltar and had the task of maintaining naval superiority and providing a strong escort for convoys to and from the Malta.<ref name=\"Stug180\">Sturgeson, pp. 180\u2013181</ref> Malta was {{convert|60|mi|km}} from Sicily and one of the first targets of the Italian army and the [[Regia Aeronautica]]; the air defence of Malta comprised six obsolescent [[Gloster Gladiator]] biplanes. After the first Italian air attacks it became clear that Malta could be defended and in early July, the Gladiators were reinforced by twelve [[Hawker Hurricane]] fighters.<ref name=\"Stug180\" />\n\nThe ''[[Kriegsmarine]]'' began operations in the Mediterranean with establishment of the [[23rd U-boat Flotilla]] at a base on [[Salamis Island]] in [[Greece]] in September 1941.

Over December 1941 into early 1942, Allied forces pushed the Italian-German forces back through Libya to roughly the limit of the previous Operation Compass advance. Taking advantage of the Allied position, German forces counter-attacked and pushed back the Allies to Gazala, west of Tobruk. As both sides prepared offensives, the Axis forces struck first and inflicted a big defeat upon the Allied forces during the [[Battle of Gazala]].<ref>Overy, pp. 120\u2013121</ref> The routed Allied forces retreated to Egypt where they made a stand at El Alamein.<ref name=\"O130\">Overy, pp. 130\u2013131.</ref>\n\nFollowing the [[First Battle of El Alamein]], which had stalled the Axis advance into Egypt, British forces went onto the offensive in October.<ref name=\"O130\" /> The [[Second Battle of El Alamein]] marked a watershed in the Western Desert Campaign and turned the tide in the North African Campaign. It ended the Axis threat to Egypt, the Suez Canal and of gaining access to the Middle Eastern and Persian oil fields via North Africa. As the Eighth Army pushed west across the desert, capturing Libya, German forces occupied southern France and landed in Tunisia. On 8 November, Allied forces launched [[Operation Torch]] landing in various places across French North Africa.

They reopened the Mediterranean route to the Middle East. They went on from Africa to liberate Sicily, Sardinia, and Corsica. They caused Mussolini to topple from power, and they brought his successors to surrender. They drew more and more German military resources into a stubborn defence of the Italian peninsula, and helped the Yugoslavs to pin down within their spirited country thousands of Axis troops. Eventually, the Allies delivered a solid blow from southern France against the German forces which were opposing the Allied drive from the beaches of Normandy! They made Marseilles available for Allied use and they occupied northern Italy and Greece.\" Howe further notes that \"Hitler had always accepted the principle that the Mediterranean was an area of paramount Italian interest just as, farther north, German interests were exclusive.<ref name=\"Howe, pp. 3\u201310\"/></blockquote>\n\nAllied forces were placed under the command of a Supreme Allied Commander [[AFHQ]] Mediterranean, General [[Dwight D.

Axis forces were caught between the Allied armies during the [[Tunisia Campaign]] but managed to delay the Allied advance by defensive operations, most notably with the [[Battle of the Kasserine Pass]] and a temporary defensive success at the [[Battle of the Mareth Line]]. After shattering the Axis defence on the Mareth Line, the Allies squeezed Axis forces into a pocket around Tunis. Axis resistance in Africa ended on 13 May 1943, with the unconditional surrender of nearly 240,000 men, who became [[prisoners of war]].<ref>Overy, pp. 148\u2013149</ref>\n\n== Southern Europe ==\n=== Italian campaign ===\n{{Main|Italian Campaign (World War II)}}\n[[File:The British Army in Italy 1943 NA8236.jpg|thumb|Men of the 10th Battalion, [[Royal Berkshire Regiment]], part of [[168th (2nd London) Brigade|168th Brigade]] of [[56th (London) Infantry Division|British 56th Division]], climbing the heights of [[Calvi Risorta]] shortly after the [[Allied invasion of Italy|invasion of Italy]], October 1943.]]\nFollowing the Allied victory in North Africa the [[Allied invasion of Sicily|Allies invaded Sicily]] in [[Allied invasion of Sicily|Operation Husky]] on 10 July 1943, with [[Amphibious warfare|amphibious]] and [[Airborne forces|airborne]] landings.

The vast size of the [[Mediterranean]] and [[Middle East]] theatre saw interconnected naval, land, and air campaigns fought for control of the Mediterranean, [[North Africa]], the Horn of Africa, the Middle East and [[Southern Europe]]. The fighting in this theatre lasted from 10 June 1940, when [[Kingdom of Italy|Italy]] entered the war on the side of [[Nazi Germany|Germany]], until 2 May 1945 when all [[Axis powers|Axis forces]] in Italy surrendered. However, fighting would continue in [[Kingdom of Greece|Greece]] \u2013 where [[British Army|British troops]] had been dispatched to aid the [[Government of Greece|Greek government]] \u2013 during the early stages of the [[Greek Civil War]].\n\nThe British referred to this theatre as the Mediterranean and Middle East Theatre (so called due to the location of the fighting and the name of [[Middle East Command]]), the Americans called it the '''Mediterranean Theater of War''' and the German informal official history of the fighting is '''The Mediterranean, South-East Europe, and North Africa 1939\u20131941''' (1995). Regardless of the size of the theatre, the various campaigns were not seen as neatly separated areas of operations but part of a vast theatre of war.\n\n[[Kingdom of Italy#Fascist regime (1922\u20131943)|Fascist Italy]] aimed to carve out a new [[Roman Empire]], while [[British Armed Forces|British forces]] aimed initially to retain the status quo. Italy invaded Greece, and not until the introduction of German forces were Greece and [[Kingdom of Yugoslavia|Yugoslavia]] overrun. Allied and Axis forces engaged in back and forth fighting across North Africa, with Axis interference in the Middle East causing fighting to spread there. With confidence high from early gains, [[Wehrmacht|German forces]] planned elaborate attacks to be launched to capture the Middle East and then to possibly attack the southern border of the [[Soviet Union]]. In three years of fighting, Axis forces were defeated in North Africa and their interference in the Middle East was halted. The anti-Axis coalition then commenced the [[Allied invasion of Italy]], resulting in the Italians deposing [[Benito Mussolini|Mussolini]] and joining the Allies. A prolonged [[Italian Campaign (World War II)|battle for Italy]] took place between Allied and Axis forces. As the strategic situation changed in south-east Europe, British troops returned to Greece.\n\nThe theatre of war had the longest duration of the Second World War, resulted in the destruction of the [[Italian Empire]] and altered the strategic position of Germany, resulting in German divisions being deployed to Africa and Italy and total German losses (including those captured upon final surrender) being over two million.{{efn|While the fighting around the Mediterranean formed the longest fought over [[Theater (warfare)|theatre of war]] during the [[Second World War]], the [[Battle of the Atlantic]] was fought from 1939 to 1945, the war's longest continuous [[military campaign]].<ref>Blair (1996), p. xiii</ref><ref>Woodman (2004), p. 1</ref>}} Italian losses amounted to around 177,000 men with a further several hundred thousand captured during the process of the various campaigns.

The territory provided a strongly defended harbour, from which ships could operate in the Atlantic and the Mediterranean. [[Force H]] ([[Vice-Admiral]] [[James Fownes Somerville|James Somerville]]) was based in Gibraltar and had the task of maintaining naval superiority and providing a strong escort for convoys to and from the Malta.<ref name=\"Stug180\">Sturgeson, pp. 180\u2013181</ref> Malta was {{convert|60|mi|km}} from Sicily and one of the first targets of the Italian army and the [[Regia Aeronautica]]; the air defence of Malta comprised six obsolescent [[Gloster Gladiator]] biplanes. After the first Italian air attacks it became clear that Malta could be defended and in early July, the Gladiators were reinforced by twelve [[Hawker Hurricane]] fighters.<ref name=\"Stug180\" />\n\nThe ''[[Kriegsmarine]]'' began operations in the Mediterranean with establishment of the [[23rd U-boat Flotilla]] at a base on [[Salamis Island]] in [[Greece]] in September 1941.

The defence of the island ensured that the Allies had an advantage in the fight to control the Mediterranean and as the garrison recovered from periods of intense bombing, aircraft, submarines and light surface ships resumed attacks on Axis supply ships, leading to fuel and supply shortages for the Axis forces in Libya.<ref name=\"Stug180\" />\n\n== Allied reply ==\n=== North Africa ===\n{{Main|Western Desert Campaign}}\nDuring 1941, the British launched several offensives to push back the Axis forces in North Africa. [[Operation Brevity]] failed as did [[Operation Battleaxe]] but [[Operation Crusader]], the third and larger offensive was launched at the end of the year. Over December 1941 into early 1942, Allied forces pushed the Italian-German forces back through Libya to roughly the limit of the previous Operation Compass advance. Taking advantage of the Allied position, German forces counter-attacked and pushed back the Allies to Gazala, west of Tobruk. As both sides prepared offensives, the Axis forces struck first and inflicted a big defeat upon the Allied forces during the [[Battle of Gazala]].<ref>Overy, pp. 120\u2013121</ref> The routed Allied forces retreated to Egypt where they made a stand at El Alamein.<ref name=\"O130\">Overy, pp. 130\u2013131.</ref>\n\nFollowing the [[First Battle of El Alamein]], which had stalled the Axis advance into Egypt, British forces went onto the offensive in October.<ref name=\"O130\" /> The [[Second Battle of El Alamein]] marked a watershed in the Western Desert Campaign and turned the tide in the North African Campaign. It ended the Axis threat to Egypt, the Suez Canal and of gaining access to the Middle Eastern and Persian oil fields via North Africa. As the Eighth Army pushed west across the desert, capturing Libya, German forces occupied southern France and landed in Tunisia. On 8 November, Allied forces launched [[Operation Torch]] landing in various places across French North Africa.

They reopened the Mediterranean route to the Middle East. They went on from Africa to liberate Sicily, Sardinia, and Corsica. They caused Mussolini to topple from power, and they brought his successors to surrender. They drew more and more German military resources into a stubborn defence of the Italian peninsula, and helped the Yugoslavs to pin down within their spirited country thousands of Axis troops. Eventually, the Allies delivered a solid blow from southern France against the German forces which were opposing the Allied drive from the beaches of Normandy! They made Marseilles available for Allied use and they occupied northern Italy and Greece.\" Howe further notes that \"Hitler had always accepted the principle that the Mediterranean was an area of paramount Italian interest just as, farther north, German interests were exclusive.<ref name=\"Howe, pp. 3\u201310\"/></blockquote>\n\nAllied forces were placed under the command of a Supreme Allied Commander [[AFHQ]] Mediterranean, General [[Dwight D. Eisenhower]]. Axis forces were caught between the Allied armies during the [[Tunisia Campaign]] but managed to delay the Allied advance by defensive operations, most notably with the [[Battle of the Kasserine Pass]] and a temporary defensive success at the [[Battle of the Mareth Line]]. After shattering the Axis defence on the Mareth Line, the Allies squeezed Axis forces into a pocket around Tunis. Axis resistance in Africa ended on 13 May 1943, with the unconditional surrender of nearly 240,000 men, who became [[prisoners of war]].<ref>Overy, pp. 148\u2013149</ref>\n\n== Southern Europe ==\n=== Italian campaign ===\n{{Main|Italian Campaign (World War II)}}\n[[File:The British Army in Italy 1943 NA8236.jpg|thumb|Men of the 10th Battalion, [[Royal Berkshire Regiment]], part of [[168th (2nd London) Brigade|168th Brigade]] of [[56th (London) Infantry Division|British 56th Division]], climbing the heights of [[Calvi Risorta]] shortly after the [[Allied invasion of Italy|invasion of Italy]], October 1943.]]\nFollowing the Allied victory in North Africa the [[Allied invasion of Sicily|Allies invaded Sicily]] in [[Allied invasion of Sicily|Operation Husky]] on 10 July 1943, with [[Amphibious warfare|amphibious]] and [[Airborne forces|airborne]] landings. The Germans were unable to prevent the Allied capture of the island but evacuated most of their troops and equipment to the mainland before the Allies entered [[Messina]] on 17 August.<ref>Keegan, pp. 288\u2013290.</ref> On 25 July, the [[Government of Italy|Italian government]] deposed [[Benito Mussolini|Mussolini]], the Italian leader, who was subsequently arrested.

The Italian government signed the surrender the same day, believing they would be given time to make preparations against the anticipated German intervention. The Allies announced the [[Armistice of Cassibile]] on 8 September and German forces implemented plans to occupy the Italian peninsula. On 9 September, American and British forces of the [[United States Army North|US Fifth Army]] [[Allied invasion of Italy#Salerno landings|landed at Salerno]] in Operation Avalanche and more British airborne troops landed at [[Taranto]] in [[Operation Slapstick]].<ref>Sturgeson, pp. 212\u2013213.</ref> German forces which had escaped from Sicily were concentrated against Avalanche, while additional forces were brought in to occupy Rome and disarm the [[Royal Italian Army during World War II|Italian Army]] in central and northern Italy.<ref>Keegan, pp. 291\u2013292.</ref>\n[[File:Soldados da For\u00e7a Expedicion\u00e1ria Brasileira na It\u00e1lia durante a II Guerra Mundial.tif|thumb|[[Brazilian Expeditionary Force|Brazilian soldiers]] celebrate the Brazilian Independence Day in Italy during World War II, September 1944.]]\nThe Germans were unable to prevent the Italian fleet sailing to Malta, although the battleship [[Italian battleship Roma (1940)|''Roma'']] was sunk by the Luftwaffe on 9 September.<ref name=Keegan291 /> In the occupied areas of southern Europe and the Mediterranean, German forces rapidly disarmed and captured Italian troops, putting down any resistance they offered in Yugoslavia, southern France and Greece.<ref>Keegan, p. 292.</ref> Meanwhile, on 16 September, a German airborne force led by [[Otto Skorzeny]] rescued Mussolini from the mountain resort in the [[Gran Sasso raid|Gran Sasso]] where he was being held.

The German prepared defensive line called the [[Winter Line]] (parts of which were called the Gustav Line) proved a major obstacle to the Allies at the end of 1943, halting the advance. [[Battle of Anzio|Operation Shingle]], an amphibious assault at Anzio behind the line was intended to break it, but did not have the desired effect. The line was eventually broken by frontal assault at the [[Battle of Monte Cassino#Fourth and final battle|Fourth Battle of Monte Cassino]] in the Spring of 1944 and [[Rome]] was captured in June.<ref name=\"CK3\" />\n\nFollowing the fall of Rome, the [[Normandy landings]] (6 June 1944) that began [[Operation Overlord]] and the [[Red Army]] victories on the [[Eastern Front (World War II)|Eastern Front]], the Italian campaign became of secondary importance to both sides. The [[Gothic Line]] north of Rome was not broken until the [[Spring 1945 offensive in Italy|Spring offensive]] of 1945.<ref name=Cl1>Clark, p. 1.</ref> From 1944 to the end of war, the Italian Front was made up of a multi-national Allied force of Americans (including segregated [[92nd Infantry Division (United States)|African]] and [[442nd Infantry Regiment (United States)|Japanese-Americans]]), [[Brazilian Expeditionary Force|Brazilians]], British, [[I Canadian Corps|Canadians]], Czechs, [[French Expeditionary Corps (1943\u20131944)|French]], Greeks, anti-fascist Italians, the [[2nd New Zealand Division]], [[II Corps (Poland)|Poles]], [[6th Armoured Division (South Africa)|South Africans and Rhodesians]] as well as members of the British and French empires, including the [[3rd Algerian Infantry Division]], Gurkhas, [[8th Infantry Division (India)|Indians]], [[Free French Forces#Divisions|Moroccans]] and forces raised in [[Mandatory Palestine]].<ref>Ready (1985a)</ref><ref>Ready (1985b)</ref><ref>Corrigan (2011), p. 523</ref> On 1 May, [[Schutzstaffel|SS]] General [[Karl Wolff]] and the [[Commander-in-Chief]] of the [[10th Army (Wehrmacht)|German 10th Army]], General [[Heinrich von Vietinghoff]], after [[Operation Sunrise (World War II)|Operation Sunrise]] (protracted, clandestine, [[negotiation]]s with the Allies), ordered German armed forces in Italy to make an [[unconditional surrender]] to the Allies on 2 May 1945.<ref name=\"Sturgeson, pp. 304\u2013305\">Sturgeson, pp. 304\u2013305</ref>\n\n=== Dodecanese Campaign ===\n{{Main|Dodecanese Campaign}}\nThe brief campaign in the Italian-held [[Dodecanese Islands]] resulted as both Germany and the Allies scrambled to occupy them after the surrender of Italy in early September 1943. The main island of Rhodes was swiftly secured by German forces, but British garrisons were established on most islands by mid-September. German air superiority, tactical prowess, and the absence of Allied reinforcements doomed the Allied effort, however. German forces, including [[Fallschirmj\u00e4ger|paratroopers]] and [[Brandenburgers|Brandenburger]] commandos, launched a counter-offensive, capturing the island of [[Kos]] within two days in early October. A massive 50-day-long aerial campaign was launched against the island of [[Leros]] defended by Italian troops commanded by Admiral Mascherpa, who resisted the German air offensive before the landing of British support troops, which was invaded by the Germans who landed by sea and air on 12 November and surrendered four days later. The remaining British garrisons were then evacuated to the [[Middle East]].<ref name=\"CK3\" />\n\n=== Invasion of southern France ===\n{{Main|Operation Dragoon}}\nOn 15 August 1944, in an effort to aid their operations in [[Normandy]], the Allies launched [[Operation Dragoon]] \u2014 the invasion of Southern France between [[Toulon]] and [[Cannes]]. The Allies rapidly broke out of their beachheads and fanned out north and east to join up with the [[Twelfth Army Group|American 12th Army Group]] which was breaking out of the Normandy beachhead. In early September supreme command of the [[Sixth Army Group|6th Army Group]] moved from AFHQ to [[SHAEF]] and the 6th Army Group moved out of the Mediterranean Theatre and into the [[European Theatre of World War II|European Theatre]] fighting as one of three Allied army groups on the [[Western Front (World War II)|Western Front]].<ref name=\"CK3\">Clark, p. 3.</ref>\n\n== Post-war conflicts ==\n=== Trieste ===\nAt the end of the war in Europe, on 1 May 1945, troops of the 4th Army of the [[Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia]] and the [[Slovenes|Slovene]] 9th Corpus [[Slovene Partisans|NLA]] occupied the town of [[Trieste]]. The [[Wehrmacht|Germans]] surrendered to the Allies which entered the town the following day. The Yugoslavs had to leave the town some days after.<ref name=\"Sturgeson, pp. 304\u2013305\"/>\n\n=== Greece ===\nAllied forces which had been sent to Greece in October 1944 after the German withdrawal, were attacked by the leftist [[National Liberation Front (Greece)|EAM]]-[[Greek People's Liberation Army|ELAS]] [[Greek Resistance|Resistance]] movement, resulting in clashes in [[Athens]] during December of that year, which began the [[Greek Civil War]].<ref>Sturgeson, pp. 274\u2013275</ref>\n\n=== Syria ===\n{{Further|Levant Crisis}}\nIn Syria, nationalist protests were on the rise at the continued occupation of the [[Levant]] by France in May 1945. French forces then tried to quell the protests but concern with heavy Syrian casualties forced Winston Churchill to oppose French action there. After being rebuffed by Charles De Gaulle he ordered British forces under general [[Bernard Paget]] into Syria from [[Jordan]] with orders to fire on the French if necessary. A crisis began as British armoured cars and troops then reached the Syrian capital Damascus following which the French were escorted and confined to their barracks. With political pressure added the French ordered a ceasefire; following which the French withdrew from Syria the following year.<ref name=\"Luce\">{{cite book|last1=Luce|first1=Henry Robinson|title=Time, Volume 45|date=1945|publisher=Time Incorporated|pages=25\u201326|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=U-ELAQAAIAAJ&q=}}</ref>\n\n=== Palestine ===\n{{Further|Intercommunal conflict in Mandatory Palestine}}\nPrior to the war the [[British Mandate for Palestine (legal instrument)|British Mandate in Palestine]] was faced with [[ethnic violence]] between the Muslim population and Jewish residents and colonists in Mandatory Palestine, that carried over into the war.
