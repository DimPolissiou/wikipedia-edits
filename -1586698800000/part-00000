Tasting success and seeing money to be made, Homer takes to the streets as one of the [[paparazzi]].\n\nOvernight, Homer becomes Springfield's most valued tabloid photographer, provoking several local celebrities to commit embarrassing or criminal acts and then snapping pictures of them. After he gate-crashes [[Rainier Wolfcastle]] and Maria Shriver Kennedy Quimby's wedding, the celebrities turn the tables on him by hiring top paparazzo Enrico Irritazio to get photos of Homer on his worst behavior (showering at a fire hydrant, letting Maggie drive while trying to beat up Enrico, and burning a jury duty card). Seeing these photos in the tabloids prompts Homer to give up the paparazzi business temporarily, but Lenny and Carl persuade him to resume his work, using a camera that Moe had hidden in the ladies' room of his tavern. Immediately after Moe gives Homer the camera, two women enter the bar and ask to use the restroom so they can trade [[bra]]s and [[panties]], infuriating Moe since he's no longer have the camera to spy on them.\n\nHomer bursts in on the celebrities at their favorite nightclub and takes many compromising photos (of which include [[Sideshow Mel]] eating the [[Flag of the United States|American flag]], Paris Texan making out with Milhouse, Drederick Tatum snorting the ashes of Secretariat like cocaine, and Mayor Quimby and Kent Brockman dressed in sexual costumes and roleplaying). Wolfcastle, resigned to having everyone's outrageous acts exposed, asks Homer what he plans to do with the pictures. Homer says that he will not make them public, as long as the celebrities start treating their fans with more respect and stop taking them for granted. Wolfcastle agrees and, in a show of good faith, invites the Simpsons to a barbecue at an offshore \"party platform\" he owns. Here, Marge shows Wolfcastle a screenplay she has written; he quickly flips through it and turns it down. Not long after the party, though, she and Homer find that Wolfcastle has stolen the idea and turned it into a movie, which is now playing at a local theater. Marge does not mind the idea theft, because, in the end, the movie got made.\n\n==Casting==\n\nThis episode marks the return of several guest stars; it is the ninth appearance of [[Jon Lovitz]] and the second of [[J. K. Simmons]] and [[Betty White]]. J. K. Simmons had previously guest-starred in \"[[Moe'N'a Lisa]]\", playing another editor.\n\nIn both episodes his character was a parody of his [[J.

Founded by [[Adam Werbach]] in 1991, it now has about 14,000 members and is almost entirely student-led.\n\n== National-level ==\n\nThe Sierra Student Coalition is directed by a paid National Director.\n\nThe SSC is governed by a seven-member volunteer Executive Committee (Ex-Com). The Ex-Com sets the national campaign priorities of the SSC and is responsible for allocating the annual budget, prioritizing national campaigns, and serving the volunteer membership and Chapter structure of the SSC. Every ExCom member also serves on a subcommittee, the venues where the rest of the SSC's national activities are organized.\n\nThe current SSC Ex-Com, for 2015-2016, consists of Caroline Engle, Courtney Pal, Mitchelle De Leon, Gabby Benavente, Maria Langholz, Drew O'Bryan, and Jacqueline Yap.\n\nThe other major committees include:\n\nThe Campaign Committee (CampCom). Camp-Com is responsible for planning and developing the SSC's national campaign priorities, including development of relevant campaign resources in coordination with SSC staff. The SSC's current priority campaign is \"Campuses Beyond Coal\". The campaign is designed to be run on college campuses or in local communities.\n\nThe Trainings Committee. Trainings-Com teaches the skills that the SSC's member activists use to organize. In coordination with the SSC Trainings Director, the Trainings-Com is responsible for conducting Summer Environmental Training Programs (SPROG) during the summer. They also run workshops at regional and national conferences and train students who want to become trainers themselves.\n\nThe Anti-Oppression Committee (AO Com). AO Com works to establish Anti- Oppression as an integral part of the SSC in order to encourage [[Diversity (politics)|diversity]], inclusivity, and the open exchange of ideas. In addition, AO Com also creates an open and safe space for the SSC through the implementation of AO curriculum in SSC gatherings, including SPROG. AO Com adamantly creates and/or adjusts any projects, policies, or initiatives to integrate AO principles within the SSC at both a [[grassroots]] and national level. Collaboration and input from all SSCers between all committees is used to accomplish these goals.<ref>[http://ssc.sierraclub.org/get-involved/national-committees/index.html SSC Committees Web Page]</ref>\n\n== Chapter-level ==\n\nThe lifeblood of the SSC is a nationwide network of Campus and Community Organizers. These organizers are the students who win the victories that advance the SSC and the student [[environmental movement]].\n\nCampus Organizers organize SSC groups that run local campaigns on their high school or college campus. These local campaigns are usually consistent with SSC priority issue focus at the national and state-level.\n\nCommunity Organizers bring together existing SSC campus groups and group leaders and/or recruiting non-SSC groups to the SSC that are within a close geographic proximity. These groups pursue a local campaign that is usually consistent with the SSC's national issue focus. A community organizer position only becomes available once there are at least two functioning and registered SSC campus groups within a community to organize and coordinate. Community Organizers often utilize Sierra Club as a recruitment partner.\n\nA Chapter Organizing Team (or State ExCom) is formed when there are multiple campus groups or community campaigns that work together on a statewide campaign. The Chapter Organizing Team is a collection of the Community Organizers throughout a state. They mentor Campus Organizers and planning state trainings or conferences.\n\n== Priority Campaign: The Campus Climate Challenge ==\nThe Campus Climate Challenge is a project of more than 30 leading youth organizations throughout the U.S. and Canada, including the Sierra Student Coalition. The Challenge leverages the power of young people to organize on college campuses and high schools across Canada and the U.S. to win 100% [[clean energy]] policies at their schools. The goal of the Challenge is to grow a generation-wide movement to stop [[global warming]], by reducing [[carbon emissions]] from their high schools and colleges down to zero, and leading society to a clean energy future.<ref>[http://www.Climatechallenge.org Campus Climate Challenge Website]</ref>\n\nDuring the summer of 2007 the Sierra Student Coalition worked in partnership with the [[Sierra Club]] and the US Steelworks Union, in [[New Hampshire]] and [[Iowa]] to reach out to citizens to call for action to cut carbon emissions 80% by 2050 and to create 2 million new jobs in a clean energy economy. With the ReEnergizeUS campaign, the SSC held two major five-day marches of hundreds of people which culminated at rallies in [[Des Moines]] and [[Concord, New Hampshire|Concord]].<ref>[http://www.climatesummer.org ReEnergizeUS Website]</ref>\n\n== Summer Environmental Leader Training Program (SPROG) ==\nSPROG is a week-long youth leadership and [[grassroots]] training program. High school and college students learn the essentials of grassroots advocacy, build community, and learn the skills to be a force for change.  SPROGs are held in several locations throughout the United States each summer. Six programs take place every summer, and SPROGs are regularly held in the Southwest, Southeast, Northeast/Mid-Atlantic, Northwest regions, and in Puerto Rico.<ref>[http://ssc.sierraclub.org/get-involved/training/summer-environmental-leader-training-program/index.html SPROG Home Page]</ref>\n\n==See also==\n*[[Education in the United States]]\n*[[Environment of the United States]]\n*[[Environmental groups and resources serving K\u201312 schools]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* [http://ssc.sierraclub.org/ Sierra Student Coalition Website]\n* [http://beyondcoal.org/ Beyond Coal Campaign]\n\n[[Category:Environmental organizations based in Washington, D.C.]]\n[[Category:Student organizations established in 1991]]\n[[Category:Sierra Club]]\n[[Category:Student political organizations in the United States]]\n[[Category:Climate change organizations]]\n[[Category:Youth empowerment organizations]]\n[[Category:Youth-led organizations]]\n[[Category:Climate change organizations based in the United States]]\n[[Category:501(c)(3) nonprofit organizations]]\n[[Category:Non-profit organizations based in Washington, D.C.]]\n[[Category:1991 establishments in the United States]]\n", "text_old": "{{multiple issues|\n{{COI|date=January 2013}}\n{{notability|Companies|date=January 2013}}\n{{primary sources|date=January 2013}}\n{{Advert|date=November 2011}}\n}}\n{{Infobox organization\n| name = Sierra Student Coalition\n| logo = Sierra Student Coalition Logo.jpg\n| logo_size = 150px\n| type = [[501(c)3]]\n| founded_date = 1991<br/>[[Washington, D.C.]], United States\n| location = [[Washington, D.C.]], United States\n| key_people = Karissa Gerhke, National Director\n| focus = [[Environmentalism]], [[Global Warming]], [[Renewable Energy]]\n| method = [[Direct action]], [[lobbying]], [[petition]], [[Demonstration (people)|demonstration]]\n| homepage = {{URL|ssc.sierraclub.org}}\n}}\nThe '''Sierra Student Coalition''' ('''SSC''') is the national student chapter of the [[Sierra Club]], a [[grassroots]] [[environmental organization]].

In coordination with the SSC Trainings Director, the Trainings-Com is responsible for conducting Summer Environmental Training Programs (SPROG) during the summer. They also run workshops at regional and national conferences and train students who want to become trainers themselves.\n\nThe Anti-Oppression Committee (AO Com). AO Com works to establish Anti- Oppression as an integral part of the SSC in order to encourage [[Diversity (politics)|diversity]], inclusivity, and the open exchange of ideas. In addition, AO Com also creates an open and safe space for the SSC through the implementation of AO curriculum in SSC gatherings, including SPROG. AO Com adamantly creates and/or adjusts any projects, policies, or initiatives to integrate AO principles within the SSC at both a [[grassroots]] and national level. Collaboration and input from all SSCers between all committees is used to accomplish these goals.<ref>[http://ssc.sierraclub.org/get-involved/national-committees/index.html SSC Committees Web Page]</ref>\n\n== Chapter-level ==\n\nThe lifeblood of the SSC is a nationwide network of Campus and Community Organizers. These organizers are the students who win the victories that advance the SSC and the student [[environmental movement]].\n\nCampus Organizers organize SSC groups that run local campaigns on their high school or college campus. These local campaigns are usually consistent with SSC priority issue focus at the national and state-level.\n\nCommunity Organizers bring together existing SSC campus groups and group leaders and/or recruiting non-SSC groups to the SSC that are within a close geographic proximity. These groups pursue a local campaign that is usually consistent with the SSC's national issue focus. A community organizer position only becomes available once there are at least two functioning and registered SSC campus groups within a community to organize and coordinate. Community Organizers often utilize Sierra Club as a recruitment partner.\n\nA Chapter Organizing Team (or State ExCom) is formed when there are multiple campus groups or community campaigns that work together on a statewide campaign. The Chapter Organizing Team is a collection of the Community Organizers throughout a state. They mentor Campus Organizers and planning state trainings or conferences.\n\n== Priority Campaign: The Campus Climate Challenge ==\nThe Campus Climate Challenge is a project of more than 30 leading youth organizations throughout the U.S. and Canada, including the Sierra Student Coalition. The Challenge leverages the power of young people to organize on college campuses and high schools across Canada and the U.S. to win 100% [[clean energy]] policies at their schools. The goal of the Challenge is to grow a generation-wide movement to stop [[global warming]], by reducing [[carbon emissions]] from their high schools and colleges down to zero, and leading society to a clean energy future.<ref>[http://www.Climatechallenge.org Campus Climate Challenge Website]</ref>\n\nDuring the summer of 2007 the Sierra Student Coalition worked in partnership with the [[Sierra Club]] and the US Steelworks Union, in [[New Hampshire]] and [[Iowa]] to reach out to citizens to call for action to cut carbon emissions 80% by 2050 and to create 2 million new jobs in a clean energy economy. With the ReEnergizeUS campaign, the SSC held two major five-day marches of hundreds of people which culminated at rallies in [[Des Moines]] and [[Concord, New Hampshire|Concord]].<ref>[http://www.climatesummer.org ReEnergizeUS Website]</ref>\n\n== Summer Environmental Leader Training Program (SPROG) ==\nSPROG is a week-long youth leadership and [[grassroots]] training program. High school and college students learn the essentials of grassroots advocacy, build community, and learn the skills to be a force for change.  SPROGs are held in several locations throughout the United States each summer. Six programs take place every summer, and SPROGs are regularly held in the Southwest, Southeast, Northeast/Mid-Atlantic, Northwest regions, and in Puerto Rico.<ref>[http://ssc.sierraclub.org/get-involved/training/summer-environmental-leader-training-program/index.html SPROG Home Page]</ref>\n\n==See also==\n*[[Education in the United States]]\n*[[Environment of the United States]]\n*[[Environmental groups and resources serving K\u201312 schools]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* [http://ssc.sierraclub.org/ Sierra Student Coalition Website]\n* [http://beyondcoal.org/ Beyond Coal Campaign]\n\n[[Category:Environmental organizations based in Washington, D.C.]]\n[[Category:Student organizations established in 1991]]\n[[Category:Sierra Club]]\n[[Category:Student political organizations in the United States]]\n[[Category:Climate change organizations]]\n[[Category:Youth empowerment organizations]]\n[[Category:Youth-led organizations]]\n[[Category:Climate change organizations based in the United States]]\n[[Category:501(c)(3) nonprofit organizations]]\n[[Category:Non-profit organizations based in Washington, D.C.]]\n[[Category:1991 establishments in the United States]]\n", "name_user": "Certes", "label": "safe", "comment": "Disambiguating links toGlobal warming (disambiguation)(link changed toGlobal warming) usingDisamAssist.", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sierra_Student_Coalition"}

Islamic scientific achievements encompassed a wide range of subject areas, especially [[Astronomy in the medieval Islamic world|astronomy]], [[Mathematics in medieval Islam|mathematics]], and [[Medicine in the medieval Islamic world|medicine]]. Other subjects of scientific inquiry included [[Alchemy and chemistry in medieval Islam|alchemy and chemistry]], [[botany]] and [[agronomy]], [[Geography and cartography in medieval Islam|geography and cartography]], [[Ophthalmology in medieval Islam|ophthalmology]], [[pharmacology]], [[Physics in the medieval Islamic world|physics]], and [[zoology]].\n\nMedieval Islamic science had practical purposes as well as the goal of understanding. For example, astronomy was useful for determining the ''[[Qibla]]'', the direction in which to pray, botany had practical application in agriculture, as in the works of [[Ibn Bassal]] and [[Ibn al-'Awwam]], and geography enabled [[Abu Zayd al-Balkhi]] to make accurate maps. Islamic mathematicians such as [[Al-Khwarizmi]], [[Avicenna]] and [[Jamsh\u012bd al-K\u0101sh\u012b]] made advances in [[algebra]], [[trigonometry]], [[geometry]] and [[Arabic numerals]]. Islamic doctors described diseases like [[smallpox]] and [[measles]], and challenged classical Greek medical theory. [[Al-Biruni]], Avicenna and others described the preparation of hundreds of [[drugs]] made from [[medicinal plants]] and chemical compounds. Islamic physicists such as [[Ibn Al-Haytham]], Al-B\u012br\u016bn\u012b and others studied optics and mechanics as well as astronomy, criticised [[Aristotle]]'s view of motion.\n\nThe significance of medieval Islamic science has been debated by historians. The traditionalist view holds that it lacked innovation, and was mainly important for handing on ancient knowledge to [[medieval Europe]]. The revisionist view holds that it constituted a scientific revolution. Whatever the case, science flourished across a wide area around the Mediterranean and further afield, for several centuries, in a wide range of institutions.\n\n==Context==\n[[File:Map of expansion of Caliphate.svg|thumb|220px|[[Early Muslim conquests|Islamic expansion]]:\n{{legend|#a1584e|under [[Muhammad]], 622\u2013632}}\n{{legend|#ef9070|under [[Rashidun Caliphate|Rashidun caliphs]], 632\u2013661}}\n{{legend|#fad07d|under [[Umayyad Caliphate|Umayyad caliphs]], 661\u2013750}}]]\n[[File:Abbasids850.png|thumb|220px|The [[Abbasid Caliphate]], 750\u20131261 (and later in Egypt) at its height, c. 850]]\n{{further|History of Islam}}\n\nThe Islamic era began in 622. Islamic armies conquered Arabia, Egypt and Mesopotamia, eventually displacing the [[Sasanian Empire|Persian]] and [[Byzantine Empire]]s from the region. Within a century, Islam had reached the area of present-day Portugal in the west and Central Asia in the east. The [[Islamic Golden Age]] (roughly between 786 and 1258) spanned the period of the [[Abbasid Caliphate]] (750\u20131258), with stable political structures and flourishing trade. Major religious and cultural works of the [[Islamic empire]] were translated into [[Arabic]] and occasionally [[Persian language|Persian]]. [[Transmission of the Greek Classics|Islamic culture inherited Greek]], [[Indian influence on Islamic science|Indic]], [[Assyria]]n and Persian influences. A new common civilisation formed, based on Islam. An era of [[high culture]] and innovation ensued, with rapid growth in population and cities. The [[Arab Agricultural Revolution]] in the countryside brought more crops and improved agricultural technology, especially [[irrigation]]. This supported the larger population and enabled culture to flourish.<ref name=Hodgson>{{cite book |author= Hodgson, Marshall |authorlink= Marshall Hodgson |title= The Venture of Islam; Conscience and History in a World Civilisation Vol 1 |publisher= University of Chicago |date= 1974 |pages= [https://archive.org/details/ventureofislamco00hodg/page/233 233\u2013238] |isbn= 978-0-226-34683-0 |url= https://archive.org/details/ventureofislamco00hodg/page/233 }}</ref><ref name=McClellanDorn2006>McClellan and Dorn [[#CITEREFMcClellanDorn2006|2006, pp.103\u2013115]]</ref> From the 9th century onwards, scholars such as [[Al-Kindi]]<ref name=\"SEP-Al-Kindi\">{{cite web|title=Al-Kindi|url=https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/al-kindi/|work=Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy|date=17 March 2015}}</ref> translated [[India]]n, [[Assyria]]n, [[Sasanian|Sasanian (Persian)]] and [[Ancient Greece|Greek]] knowledge, including the works of [[Aristotle]], into [[Arabic]].

Alchemists regarded gold as the [[noble metal | noblest metal]], and held that other metals formed a series down to the basest, such as lead. They believed, too, that a fifth element, the [[elixir of life | elixir]], could transform a [[base metal]] into gold. [[Jabir ibn Hayyan]] (8th\u20139th centuries) wrote on alchemy, based on his own experiments. He described laboratory techniques and experimental methods that would continue in use when alchemy had transformed into chemistry. Ibn Hayyan identified many substances, including sulphuric and nitric acids. He described processes such as [[sublimation (phase transition)| sublimation]], [[reduction (chemistry)| reduction]] and [[distillation]]. He made use of equipment such as the [[alembic]] and the [[retort stand]].<ref>Masood [[#CITEREFMasood2009|2009, pp.153\u2013155]]</ref><ref>{{Cite book |last= Lagerkvist |first= Ulf |title= The Enigma of Ferment: from the Philosopher's Stone to the First Biochemical Nobel Prize |publisher= World Scientific Publishing |year= 2005|page= [https://archive.org/details/enigmaoffermentf0000lage/page/32 32] | url = https://archive.org/details/enigmaoffermentf0000lage|url-access= registration |isbn= 9789812564214 }}</ref><ref>Turner [[#CITEREFTurner1997|1997, pp.189\u2013194]]</ref>\n\n=== Astronomy and cosmology ===\n[[File:Lunar eclipse al-Biruni.jpg|thumb|[[al-Biruni]]'s explanation of the [[Lunar phase| phases of the moon]]]]\n{{main|Astronomy in the medieval Islamic world| Cosmology in medieval Islam}}\n\nAstronomy became a major discipline within Islamic science. Astronomers devoted effort both towards understanding the nature of the cosmos and to practical purposes. One application involved determining the [[Qibla |''Qibla'', the direction to face during prayer]]. Another was [[Astrology in medieval Islam| astrology]], predicting events affecting human life and [[electional astrology | selecting suitable times for actions]] such as going to war or founding a city.<ref>Turner [[#CITEREFTurner1997|1997, pp.59\u2013116]]</ref> [[Al-Battani]] (850\u2013922) accurately determined the length of the solar year.

The surviving text describes 637 plants  in alphabetical order from the letters ''sin'' to ''ya'', so the whole book must have covered several thousand kinds of plants. Al-Dinawari described the phases of [[plant growth]] and the production of flowers and fruit.

Islamic mathematics covered [[algebra]], [[geometry]] and [[arithmetic]]. Algebra was mainly used for recreation: it had few practical applications at that time. Geometry was studied at different levels. Some texts contain practical geometrical rules for surveying and for measuring figures. Theoretical geometry was a necessary prerequisite for understanding astronomy and optics, and it required years of concentrated work. Early in the Abbasid caliphate (founded 750), soon after the foundation of Baghdad in 762, some mathematical knowledge was assimilated by [[al-Mansur]]'s group of scientists from the pre-Islamic Persian tradition in astronomy. Astronomers from India were invited to the court of the caliph in the late eighth century; they explained the rudimentary [[trigonometry| trigonometrical]] techniques used in Indian astronomy. Ancient Greek works such as [[Ptolemy]]'s ''[[Almagest]]'' and [[Euclid's Elements |Euclid's ''Elements'']] were translated into Arabic. By the second half of the ninth century, Islamic mathematicians were already making contributions to the most sophisticated parts of Greek geometry. Islamic mathematics reached its apogee in the Eastern part of the Islamic world between the tenth and twelfth centuries. Most medieval Islamic mathematicians wrote in Arabic, others in Persian.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Meri |first1=Josef W. |title=Medieval Islamic Civilization, Volume 1: An Encyclopedia |date=January 2006 |publisher=Routledge |isbn=978-0-415-96691-7 |pages=484\u2013485}}</ref><ref>Turner [[#CITEREFTurner1997|1997, pp.43\u201361]]</ref><ref>{{cite journal |first=Jan P. |last=Hogendijk |last2=Berggren |first2=J.

Islamic scientific achievements encompassed a wide range of subject areas, especially [[Astronomy in the medieval Islamic world|astronomy]], [[Mathematics in medieval Islam|mathematics]], and [[Medicine in the medieval Islamic world|medicine]]. Other subjects of scientific inquiry included [[Alchemy and chemistry in medieval Islam|alchemy and chemistry]], [[botany]] and [[agronomy]], [[Geography and cartography in medieval Islam|geography and cartography]], [[Ophthalmology in medieval Islam|ophthalmology]], [[pharmacology]], [[Physics in the medieval Islamic world|physics]], and [[zoology]].\n\nMedieval Islamic science had practical purposes as well as the goal of understanding. For example, astronomy was useful for determining the ''[[Qibla]]'', the direction in which to pray, botany had practical application in agriculture, as in the works of [[Ibn Bassal]] and [[Ibn al-'Awwam]], and geography enabled [[Abu Zayd al-Balkhi]] to make accurate maps. Islamic mathematicians such as [[Al-Khwarizmi]], [[Avicenna]] and [[Jamsh\u012bd al-K\u0101sh\u012b]] made advances in [[algebra]], [[trigonometry]], [[geometry]] and [[Arabic numerals]]. Islamic doctors described diseases like [[smallpox]] and [[measles]], and challenged classical Greek medical theory. [[Al-Biruni]], Avicenna and others described the preparation of hundreds of [[drugs]] made from [[medicinal plants]] and chemical compounds. Islamic physicists such as [[Ibn Al-Haytham]], Al-B\u012br\u016bn\u012b and others studied optics and mechanics as well as astronomy, criticised [[Aristotle]]'s view of motion.\n\nThe significance of medieval Islamic science has been debated by historians. The traditionalist view holds that it lacked innovation, and was mainly important for handing on ancient knowledge to [[medieval Europe]]. The revisionist view holds that it constituted a scientific revolution. Whatever the case, science flourished across a wide area around the Mediterranean and further afield, for several centuries, in a wide range of institutions.\n\n==Context==\n[[File:Map of expansion of Caliphate.svg|thumb|220px|[[Early Muslim conquests|Islamic expansion]]:\n{{legend|#a1584e|under [[Muhammad]], 622\u2013632}}\n{{legend|#ef9070|under [[Rashidun Caliphate|Rashidun caliphs]], 632\u2013661}}\n{{legend|#fad07d|under [[Umayyad Caliphate|Umayyad caliphs]], 661\u2013750}}]]\n[[File:Abbasids850.png|thumb|220px|The [[Abbasid Caliphate]], 750\u20131261 (and later in Egypt) at its height, c. 850]]\n{{further|History of Islam}}\n\nThe Islamic era began in 622. Islamic armies conquered Arabia, Egypt and Mesopotamia, eventually displacing the [[Sasanian Empire|Persian]] and [[Byzantine Empire]]s from the region. Within a century, Islam had reached the area of present-day Portugal in the west and Central Asia in the east. The [[Islamic Golden Age]] (roughly between 786 and 1258) spanned the period of the [[Abbasid Caliphate]] (750\u20131258), with stable political structures and flourishing trade. Major religious and cultural works of the [[Islamic empire]] were translated into [[Arabic]] and occasionally [[Persian language|Persian]]. [[Transmission of the Greek Classics|Islamic culture inherited Greek]], [[Indian influence on Islamic science|Indic]], [[Assyria]]n and Persian influences. A new common civilisation formed, based on Islam. An era of [[high culture]] and innovation ensued, with rapid growth in population and cities.

He described laboratory techniques and experimental methods that would continue in use when alchemy had transformed into chemistry.

Islamic mathematics covered [[algebra]], [[geometry]] and [[arithmetic]]. Algebra was mainly used for recreation: it had few practical applications at that time. Geometry was studied at different levels. Some texts contain practical geometrical rules for surveying and for measuring figures. Theoretical geometry was a necessary prerequisite for understanding astronomy and optics, and it required years of concentrated work. Early in the Abbasid caliphate (founded 750), soon after the foundation of Baghdad in 762, some mathematical knowledge was assimilated by [[al-Mansur]]'s group of scientists from the pre-Islamic Persian tradition in astronomy. Astronomers from India were invited to the court of the caliph in the late eighth century; they explained the rudimentary [[trigonometry| trigonometrical]] techniques used in Indian astronomy. Ancient Greek works such as [[Ptolemy]]'s ''[[Almagest]]'' and [[Euclid's Elements |Euclid's ''Elements'']] were translated into Arabic. By the second half of the ninth century, Islamic mathematicians were already making contributions to the most sophisticated parts of Greek geometry. Islamic mathematics reached its apogee in the Eastern part of the Islamic world between the tenth and twelfth centuries. Most medieval Islamic mathematicians wrote in Arabic, others in Persian.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Meri |first1=Josef W. |title=Medieval Islamic Civilization, Volume 1: An Encyclopedia |date=January 2006 |publisher=Routledge |isbn=978-0-415-96691-7 |pages=484\u2013485}}</ref><ref>Turner [[#CITEREFTurner1997|1997, pp.43\u201361]]</ref><ref>{{cite journal |first=Jan P. |last=Hogendijk |last2=Berggren |first2=J.
