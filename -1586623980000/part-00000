Lost in his own world of meditation, he is a concern for his mother Supriya Vyas and father Harish Vyas who belong to the affluent Vyas family. Pooja on the other hand, is warm, confident and a complete people's person who can take care of herself and is deeply rooted in family values.\n\nNaren's parents want Pooja to be Naren's wife. Initially thinking Naren to be another rich boy, Pooja finally starts appreciating his genuine selfless nature. Naren and Pooja become best friends and Pooja falls in love with him after he saves her from being raped by his cousin, Rahul. Naren's wedding is fixed with Surbhi Singhania, the daughter of Harish's friend Yash Singhania while Pooja agrees to marry Dr. Anand. Naren's cousin, Mayank falls in love with Pooja. His love for Pooja turns into an obsession and he kills Anand on Pooja's wedding day. To save Pooja from humiliation, Naren steps in and marries her while Surbhi ends up marrying Rahul.\n\nSoon, Naren realizes that he also loves Pooja. Pooja finds out that her horoscope has some problems and feign insulting Naren and his family so they can separate. Supriya meets with an accident trying to stop Pooja and becomes mentally unstable.\n \n===One year later<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.indiawest.com/entertainment/television/zee-show-piya-albela-takes-time-leap-lead-pair-sheen/article_be645cdc-05eb-11e8-8a7c-ff2d4be7ec92.html|title=Zee Show \u2018Piya Albela\u2019 Takes Time Leap: Lead Pair Sheen Das and Akshay Mhatre to Don New Looks|last=India-West|first=R. M. VIJAYAKAR, Special to|website=India West|language=en|access-date=2019-08-12}}</ref>===\n\nPooja returns to Naren's life as Mrs. Kapoor. Naren, who was a simple and sober man, has become a ruthless womanizer. Pooja's friend, Ashish Kapoor, tries to solve Pooja and Naren's misunderstanding but Rahul misleads Ashish into believing that Pooja has fallen in love with him. Ashish joins hands with Rahul and Surbhi. Naren falls in their trap and proposes marriage to Surbhi. Pooja records Ashish's confession and stops Surbhi and Naren's wedding. A guilt-stricken Naren apologises to Pooja but Ashish comes between and tries to kill Naren. Pooja shoots Ashish and Naren takes the blame. However, Kapoor reaches the court on time and saves Pooja. \n\nPooja and Naren's wedding preparations begin but Pooja meets with an accident while praying for Supriya's recovery. Supriya recovers and is able to stop Mayank's father Rakesh from attacking Pooja. After her accident, Pooja starts behaving like a child. Her uncle, Satish Gupta takes Pooja with him to their hometown [[Dehradun]]. To stop her from being sent to a mental asylum, Naren marries her and starts taking care of her. \n\nIt is revealed that Pooja has been feigning her illness to save Naren's grandfather from Kapoor who has been threatening to expose that Naren is not the biological son of Supriya and Harish. Kapoor kidnaps Pooja who finally kills him to protect Kashinath. Planning on ending her act, Pooja's half sister Naina Goel reveals Pooja's secret to Naren instead causing him to become furious with Pooja. Naina sets her eyes on Naren wanting to take revenge on Pooja who she thinks was always preferred by their father.\n\nNaren's health deteriorates as a result of his excessive drinking. Pooja finds out Naren's real mother, Chandrika who is a prostitute. To hide this truth from the Vyas family, Satish and Pooja lie that Pooja is Chandrika's illegitimate daughter while Naina is Satish's legitimate niece. The Vyas family, except for Kashinath, start hating Pooja. Chandrika is allowed to stay with the family in the Vyas Mansion but is blamed for an attack on Supriya. The misunderstanding leads to Pooja and Chandrika leaving the house.\n\n===Six months later===\n          \nMayank is dead. Pooja lives in Krishnapuri, a [[Red-light district|red-light area]] with Chandrika. Naren is standing for elections and visits Pooja everyday at Krishnapuri. Everyone thinks that Naren does this because he loves Pooja but only Chandrika, the Vyas family and Naren's assistant Danish know that Naren in fact hates Pooja. Pooja continues to fulfil her duty of a wife.  \n\nNaren hires a shooter to kill Pooja. On a trip to Dehradun, Naren realises Pooja's trust in him and calls the sharpshooter to call off the attack. Naren and Pooja consummate their marriage. At Naren's election rally, Pooja is shot at and Naren discovers that a woman called the sharpshooter to carry put the attack. He realises Pooja was aware of his initial plan and apologises but Pooja loses all trust in him. However, they team up to expose Naina as the culprit behind causing Supriya's attack and resulting paralysis, framing Chandrika for the attack, killing Mayank, abducting a heavily pregnant Surbhi and planning to kill Rahul and marry Naren.\n\nKashinath reveals that Naren is Chandrika's son. A heart-broken Naren leaves the Vyas Mansion. At an [[ashram]], Naren and Pooja renew their marital vows. They meet Bela and Praveen, another newly-wed couple. Bela is an introvert while Praveen is an extrovert who often acts silly. Instigated by Rahul, Harish decides to kill Naren but Harsha, Naren's aunt, warns Pooja and Naren. Naren and Praveen meet with an accident and Praveen dies while Naren, needing a heart-transplant, receives Praveen's heart. A strange change appears in Naren's behaviour as he starts behaving like Praveen. It is revealed that Bela is planning to take revenge from Praveen's parents as they insulted her parents for dowry resulting in Bela's mother's death and her father's blindness. Under Bela's spell, Naren abducts Praveen's parents and Bela kills them but spares Naren for saving her father. Bela, then, surrenders to the police.\n\nNaren's adoptive sister Meghna ([[Sangeita Chauhan]]) is blind and is about to marry Kunal Goenka, the man she loves. On their wedding day, Meghna is raped and suspicion falls on Naren as he was absent from the venue. Pooja saves Naren from the accusations. The next suspicion falls on Pooja's cousin Anuj Gupta, Danish, Rahul and Kunal. The real culprit tries to kill Surbhi and Pooja as they discover his real identity. Surbhi loses her child. It is revealed that Rahul's father, Hardik Vyas is the real culprit. Hardik is arrested and Meghna and Kunal are married.\n\nAngraj ([[Sahil Uppal]]), Harish and Supriya's biological son, enters the Vyas Mansion. Angraj sets his eyes on Pooja, who he used to eve-tease and harass before her marriage, and starts plotting to kill Naren. On the day of Pooja's birthday, Anuj shoots Angraj trying to save Pooja but Naren shoots Anuj to defend his half brother resulting in both Angraj and Anuj dying causing tension between Naren and Pooja's families.\n\nAngraj is revealed to be alive and gets a plastic surgery and returns with Naren's face and kidnaps the real Naren. Angraj (as Naren) takes Naren's place at home.

Lost in his own world of meditation, he is a concern for his mother Supriya Vyas and father Harish Vyas who belong to the affluent Vyas family. Pooja on the other hand, is warm, confident and a complete people's person who can take care of herself and is deeply rooted in family values.\n\nNaren's parents want Pooja to be Naren's wife. Initially thinking Naren to be another rich boy, Pooja finally starts appreciating his genuine selfless nature. Naren and Pooja become best friends and Pooja falls in love with him after he saves her from being raped by his cousin, Rahul. Naren's wedding is fixed with Surbhi Singhania, the daughter of Harish's friend Yash Singhania while Pooja agrees to get married to Dr. Anand. Naren's cousin, Mayank falls in love with Pooja. His love for Pooja turns into an obsession and he kills Anand on Pooja's wedding day. To save Pooja from humiliation, Naren steps in and marries her while Surbhi ends up marrying Rahul.\n\nSoon, Naren realizes that he also loves Pooja. Pooja finds out that her horoscope has some problems and feign insulting Naren and his family so they can separate. Supriya meets with an accident trying to stop Pooja and becomes mentally unstable.\n \n===1 Year Later<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.indiawest.com/entertainment/television/zee-show-piya-albela-takes-time-leap-lead-pair-sheen/article_be645cdc-05eb-11e8-8a7c-ff2d4be7ec92.html|title=Zee Show \u2018Piya Albela\u2019 Takes Time Leap: Lead Pair Sheen Das and Akshay Mhatre to Don New Looks|last=India-West|first=R.

Naren, who was a simple and sober man, has become a ruthless womanizer. Pooja's friend, Ashish Kapoor, tries to solve Pooja and Naren's misunderstanding but Rahul misleads Ashish into believing that Pooja has fallen in love with him. Ashish joins hands with Rahul and Surbhi. Naren falls in their trap and proposes marriage to Surbhi. Pooja records Ashish's confession and stops Surbhi and Naren's wedding. A guilt-stricken Naren apologises to Pooja but Ashish comes between and tries to kill Naren. Pooja shoots Ashish and Naren takes the blame. However, Kapoor reaches the court on time and saves Pooja. \n\nPooja and Naren's wedding preparations begin but Pooja meets with an accident while praying for Supriya's recovery. Supriya recovers and is able to stop Mayank's father Rakesh from attacking Pooja. After her accident, Pooja starts behaving like a child. Her uncle, Satish Gupta takes Pooja with him to their hometown [[Dehradun]]. To stop her from being sent to a mental asylum, Naren marries her and starts taking care of her. \n\nIt is revealed that Pooja has been feigning her illness to save Naren's grandfather from Kapoor who has been threatening to expose that Naren is not the biological son of Supriya and Harish. Kapoor kidnaps Pooja who finally kills him to protect Kashinath. Planning on ending her act, Pooja's half sister Naina Goel reveals Pooja's secret to Naren instead causing him to become furious with Pooja. Naina sets her eyes on Naren wanting to take revenge on Pooja who she thinks was always preferred by their father.\n\nNaren's health deteriorates as a result of his excessive drinking. Pooja finds out Naren's real mother, Chandrika who is a prostitute. To hide this truth from the Vyas family, Satish and Pooja lie that Pooja is Chandrika's illegitimate daughter while Naina is Satish's legitimate niece. The Vyas family, except for Kashinath, start hating Pooja. Chandrika is allowed to stay with the family in the Vyas Mansion but is blamed for an attack on Supriya. The misunderstanding leads to Pooja and Chandrika leaving the house.\n\n===6 Months Later===\n          \nMayank is dead. Pooja lives in Krishnapuri, a [[Red-light district|red-light area]] with Chandrika. Naren is standing for elections and visits Pooja everyday at Krishnapuri. Everyone thinks that Naren does this because he loves Pooja but only Chandrika, the Vyas family and Naren's assistant Danish know that Naren in fact hates Pooja. Pooja continues to fulfil her duty of a wife.  \n\nNaren hires a shooter to kill Pooja. On a trip to Dehradun, Naren realises Pooja's trust in him and calls the sharpshooter to call off the attack. Naren and Pooja consummate their marriage. At Naren's election rally, Pooja is shot at and Naren discovers that a woman called the sharpshooter to carry put the attack. He realises Pooja was aware of his initial plan and apologises but Pooja loses all trust in him. However, they team up to expose Naina as the culprit behind causing Supriya's attack and resulting paralysis, framing Chandrika for the attack, killing Mayank, abducting a heavily pregnant Surbhi and planning to kill Rahul and marry Naren.\n\nKashinath reveals that Naren is Chandrika's son. A heart-broken Naren leaves the Vyas Mansion. At an [[ashram]], Naren and Pooja renew their marital vows. They meet Bela and Praveen, another newly-wed couple. Bela is an introvert while Praveen is an extrovert who often acts silly. Instigated by Rahul, Harish decides to kill Naren but Harsha, Naren's aunt, warns Pooja and Naren. Naren and Praveen meet with an accident and Praveen dies while Naren, needing a heart-transplant, receives Praveen's heart. A strange change appears in Naren's behaviour as he starts behaving like Praveen. It is revealed that Bela is planning to take revenge from Praveen's parents as they insulted her parents for dowry resulting in Bela's mother's death and her father's blindness. Under Bela's spell, Naren abducts Praveen's parents and Bela kills them but spares Naren for saving her father. Bela, then, surrenders to the police.\n\nNaren's adoptive sister Meghna ([[Sangeita Chauhan]]) is blind and is about to marry Kunal Goenka, the man she loves. On their wedding day, Meghna is raped and suspicion falls on Naren as he was absent from the venue. Pooja saves Naren from the accusations. The next suspicion falls on Pooja's cousin Anuj Gupta, Danish, Rahul and Kunal. The real culprit tries to kill Surbhi and Pooja as they discover his real identity. Surbhi loses her child. It is revealed that Rahul's father, Hardik Vyas is the real culprit. Hardik is arrested and Meghna and Kunal are married.\n\nAngraj ([[Sahil Uppal]]), Harish and Supriya's biological son, enters the Vyas Mansion. Angraj sets his eyes on Pooja, who he used to eve-tease and harass before her marriage, and starts plotting to kill Naren. On the day of Pooja's birthday, Anuj shoots Angraj trying to save Pooja but Naren shoots Anuj to defend his half brother resulting in both Angraj and Anuj dying causing tension between Naren and Pooja's families.\n\nAngraj is revealed to be alive and gets a plastic surgery and returns with Naren's face and kidnaps the real Naren. Angraj (as Naren) takes Naren's place at home. After an interesting twist in the plot, Supriya herself kills Angraj.\n\nThe story ends with Supriya managing Angraj's foundation, Rahul and Surbhi having a baby boy, Anuj's wife Rachel ([[Sandhya Mehta]]) gets married to Rahul's half brother Arjun Vyas ([[Khushwant Walia]]), and Pooja gets pregnant with Naren's child.\n\n==Cast==\n===Main===\n*[[Akshay Mhatre]] as Naren Vyas<ref name=\":0\" /><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.iwmbuzz.com/television/29078/2018/05/06|title=Breaking into the TV industry has become easier: Akshay Mhatre|last=Team|first=Author: Editorial|date=2018-05-06|website=IWMBuzz|language=en-US|access-date=2019-08-12}}</ref>\n**Veer Bhanushali as Young Naren Vyas\n*[[Sheen Das]] as Pooja Vyas<ref name=\":0\" /><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.deccanchronicle.com/entertainment/television/260317/i-confide-in-akshay-says-sheen-dass.html|title=I confide in Akshay, says Sheen Dass|date=26 March 2017|publisher=|accessdate=6 May 2017}}</ref>\n*[[Sahil Uppal]] as Angraj Vyas (before plastic surgery), Naren's half-brother<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.televisionsworld.com/piyaa-albela-to-be-seen-a-new-entry-in-the-form-of-sahil-uppal/|title=Piyaa Albela to be seen a new entry in the form of Sahil Uppal!|last=Rajveer|website=Televisions World|language=en-US|access-date=2019-08-12}}</ref>\n**Akshay Mhatre as Angraj (after plastic surgery)\n\n===Recurring===\n\n*[[Paintal (comedian)|Kanwarjit Paintal]] as Kashinath Vyas, patriarch of the Vyas family, Hardik and Harish's father\n*[[Avinash Wadhawan]] as Harish Vyas, Kahinath's elder son, Naren and Angraj's father<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/tv/news/hindi/avinash-wadhwan-even-an-oscar-winner-will-exhaust-all-his-creative-skills-if-he-does-our-tv-soaps/articleshow/64174073.cms|title=Avinash Wadhwan: Even an Oscar winner will exhaust all his creative skills if he does our TV soaps -

Nyabire, a member of the [[Kakwa people|Kakwa ethnic group]], converted from [[Catholic Church|Roman Catholicism]] to [[Islam]] in 1910 and changed his name to Amin Dada. He named his first-born son after himself. Abandoned by his father at a young age, Idi Amin grew up with his mother's family in a rural farming town in north-western Uganda.

This led to the paradoxical situation that the Nubians were both \"detribalised\" yet had also a distinct identity intimately linked to the West Nile region, to Islam, and to military service.{{sfn|Leopold|2005|p=60}} Amin himself stated that members of different tribes could become Nubians.{{sfn|Nugent|2012|pp=233\u2013234}} }}\n\nAmin joined an Islamic school in [[Bombo, Uganda|Bombo]] in 1941.

During the late 1960s, Obote's [[move to the left]], which included his [[Common Man's Charter]] and the [[nationalisation]] of 80 British companies, had made the West worried that he would pose a threat to Western capitalist interests in Africa and make Uganda an ally of the [[Soviet Union]]. Amin, who had served with the King's African Rifles and taken part in Britain's suppression of the [[Mau Mau uprising]] prior to Ugandan independence, was known by the British as \"intensely loyal to Britain\". This made him an obvious choice as Obote's successor.

Nyabire, a member of the [[Kakwa people|Kakwa ethnic group]], converted from [[Catholic Church|Roman Catholicism]] to [[Islam]] in 1910 and changed his name to Amin Dada. He named his first-born son after himself. Abandoned by his father at a young age, Idi Amin grew up with his mother's family in a rural farming town in north-western Uganda. Guweddeko states that Amin's mother was Assa Aatte (1904\u20131970), an ethnic [[Lugbara people|Lugbara]] and a traditional herbalist who treated members of [[Buganda]] royalty, among others.<ref name=\"monitor_01012004\"/> Some sources have also described Amin as being of mixed Kakwa-Nubian origin.{{sfn|Hansen|2013|p=85}}{{efn|The Nubians of Uganda were \"an extremely fluid category\".{{sfn|Nugent|2012|p=233}} They are often portrayed as descendants of [[Emin Pasha]]'s mostly Muslim soldiers who fled to Uganda after being defeated by [[Mahdist State|Mahdist Sudanese forces]] in the 1880s. Regarded as martial people, they were consequently recruited into British colonial units; as a result, West Nile people who wanted to join the military often claimed to be Nubians. This led to the paradoxical situation that the Nubians were both \"detribalised\" yet had also a distinct identity intimately linked to the West Nile region, to Islam, and to military service.{{sfn|Leopold|2005|p=60}} Amin himself stated that members of different tribes could become Nubians.{{sfn|Nugent|2012|pp=233\u2013234}} }}\n\nAmin joined an Islamic school in [[Bombo, Uganda|Bombo]] in 1941.

Another important result is that only one component of a particle's spin can be measured at one time, meaning that the measurement of the spin along the z-axis destroys information about a particle's spin along the x and y axis.\n\nThe experiment is normally conducted using electrically [[neutral particle]]s such as silver atoms. This avoids the large deflection in the path of a charged particle moving through a magnetic field and allows spin-dependent effects to dominate.<ref>[[Nevill Francis Mott|Mott, N.F.]], [[Harrie Massey|Massey, H.S.W.]] (1965/1971).

However, if the magnetic field is inhomogeneous then the force on one end of the dipole will be slightly greater than the opposing force on the other end, so that there is a net force which deflects the particle's trajectory. If the particles were classical spinning objects, one would expect the distribution of their spin angular momentum vectors to be [[Boltzmann distribution|random]] and [[random variable|continuous]]. Each particle would be deflected by an amount proportional to its magnetic moment, producing some density distribution on the detector screen. Instead, the particles passing through the Stern\u2013Gerlach apparatus are deflected either up or down by a specific amount. This was a measurement of the quantum [[observable]] now known as [[spin operator|spin]] angular momentum, which demonstrated possible outcomes of a measurement where the observable has a discrete set of values or [[point spectrum]].\n\nAlthough some discrete quantum phenomena, such as [[atomic spectra]], were observed much earlier, the Stern\u2013Gerlach experiment allowed scientists to observe separation between discrete quantum states for the first time in the history of science.\n\nTheoretically, [[angular momentum operator#Quantization|quantum angular momentum ''of any kind'' has a discrete spectrum]], which is sometimes briefly expressed as \"angular momentum is [[Quantization (physics)|quantized]]\".\n\n=== Experiment using particles with +{{frac|1|2}} or \u2212{{frac|1|2}} spin ===\nIf the experiment is conducted using charged particles like electrons, there will be a [[Lorentz force]] that tends to bend the trajectory in a circle. This force can be cancelled by an electric field of appropriate magnitude oriented transverse to the charged particle's path.\n\n[[File:Quantum projection of S onto z for spin half particles.PNG|100px|left|thumb|Spin values for fermions]]\n\nElectrons are [[spin-\u00bd|spin-{{frac|1|2}}]] particles. These have only two possible spin angular momentum values measured along any axis, <math>+\\frac{\\hbar}{2}</math> or <math>-\\frac{\\hbar}{2}</math>, a purely quantum mechanical phenomenon. Because its value is always the same, it is regarded as an intrinsic property of electrons, and is sometimes known as \"intrinsic angular momentum\" (to distinguish it from orbital angular momentum, which can vary and depends on the presence of other particles). If one measures the spin along a vertical axis, electrons are described as \"spin up\" or \"spin down\", based on the magnetic moment pointing up or down, respectively.\n\nTo mathematically describe the experiment with spin <math>+\\frac{1}{2}</math> particles, it is easiest to use [[Paul Adrien Maurice Dirac|Dirac]]'s [[bra\u2013ket notation]]. As the particles pass through the Stern\u2013Gerlach device, they are deflected either up or down, and observed by the detector which resolves to either spin up or spin down. These are described by the angular momentum quantum number <math>j</math>, which can take on one of the two possible allowed values, either <math>+\\frac{\\hbar}{2}</math> or <math>-\\frac{\\hbar}{2}</math>. The act of observing (measuring) the momentum along the <math>z</math> axis corresponds to the operator <math>J_z</math>.{{specify|reason=How exactly does this operator look like?|date=February 2018}} In mathematical terms, the initial state of the particles is\n:<math>|\\psi\\rangle = c_1\\left|\\psi_{j = +\\frac{\\hbar}{2}}\\right\\rangle + c_2\\left|\\psi_{j = -\\frac{\\hbar}{2}}\\right\\rangle</math>\nwhere constants <math>c_1</math> and <math>c_2</math> are complex numbers. This initial state spin can point in any direction. The squares of the [[absolute value]]s \n<math>|c_1|^2</math> and <math>|c_2|^2</math> determine the probabilities that for a system in the initial state <math>|\\psi\\rangle</math> one of the two possible values of <math>j</math> is found after the measurement is made. The constants <math>c_1</math> and <math>c_2</math> must also be normalized in order that the probability of finding either one of the values be unity, that is we must ensure that <math>|c_1|^2 + |c_2|^2 = 1</math>. However, this information is not sufficient to determine the values of <math>c_1</math> and <math>c_2</math>, because they are complex numbers. Therefore, the measurement yields only the squared magnitudes of the constants, which are interpreted as probabilities.\n\n==Sequential experiments==\n{{Confusing section|reason=a detailed explanation of the picture may be beneficial to many readers|date=February 2018}}\n\nIf we link multiple Stern\u2013Gerlach apparatuses (the rectangles containing ''S-G''), we can clearly see that they do not act as simple selectors, i.e. filtering out particles with one of the states (pre-existing to the measurement) and blocking the others. Instead they alter the state by observing it (as in [[photon polarization|light polarization]]). In the figure below, x and z name the directions of the (inhomogenous) magnetic field, with the x-z-plane being orthogonal to the particle beam. In the three S-G systems shown below, the cross-hatched squares denote the blocking of a given output, i.e. each of the S-G systems with a blocker allows only particles with one of two states to enter the next S-G apparatus in the sequence.\n<ref name=Sakurai1985>\n{{cite book\n |first=J.-J. |last=Sakurai\n |title=Modern quantum mechanics\n |publisher=[[Addison-Wesley]]\n |year=1985\n |isbn=0-201-53929-2\n}}</ref>\n[[File:Sg-seq.svg|left|640px]]\n{{clear}}\n\nThe top illustration shows that when a second, identical, S-G apparatus is placed at the exit of the z+ beam resulting of the first apparatus, only z+ is seen in the output of the second apparatus. This result is expected since only the z+ beam from the first apparatus entered the second apparatus.\n\nThe middle system shows what happens when a different S-G apparatus is placed at the exit of the z+ beam resulting of the first apparatus, the second apparatus measuring the deflection of the beams on the x axis instead of the z axis. The second apparatus produces x+ and x- outputs. Now classically we would expect to have one beam with the x characteristic oriented + and the z characteristic oriented +, and another with the x characteristic oriented - and the z characteristic oriented +.\n\nThe bottom system contradicts that expectation. The output of the third apparatus which measures the deflection on the z axis again shows z- as well as z+. Given that the input to the second S-G apparatus consisted only of z+, it can be inferred that a S-G apparatus must be altering the states of the particles that pass through it. This experiment can be interpreted to exhibit the [[uncertainty principle]] : since the angular momentum cannot be measured on two perpendicular directions at the same time, the measurement of the angular momentum on the x direction destroys the previous determination of the angular momentum in the z direction. That's why the third apparatus measures renewed z+ and z- beams like the x measurement really made a clean slate of the z+ output.\n\n==History==\n[[File:SternGerlach2.jpg|thumb|A plaque at the Frankfurt institute commemorating the experiment]]\nThe Stern\u2013Gerlach experiment was conceived by [[Otto Stern]] in 1921 and performed by him and [[Walther Gerlach]] in [[Frankfurt]] in 1922.<ref name=Sakurai1985/> At the time, Stern was an assistant to [[Max Born]] at the [[Goethe University Frankfurt|University of Frankfurt]]'s [[Institute for Theoretical Physics (Frankfurt)|Institute for Theoretical Physics]],{{citation needed|date=February 2018}} and Gerlach was an assistant at the same university's [[Institute for Experimental Physics (Frankfurt)|Institute for Experimental Physics]].{{citation needed|date=February 2018}}\n\nAt the time of the experiment, the most prevalent model for describing the [[atom]] was the [[Bohr model]],{{citation needed|date=February 2018}} which described [[electrons]] as going around the positively charged [[Atomic nucleus|nucleus]] only in certain discrete [[atomic orbital]]s or [[energy levels]].

Another important result is that only one component of a particle's spin can be measured at one time, meaning that the measurement of the spin along the z-axis destroys information about a particle's spin along the x and y axis.\n\nThe experiment is normally conducted using electrically [[neutral particle]]s such as silver atoms. This avoids the large deflection in the path of a charged particle moving through a magnetic field and allows spin-dependent effects to dominate.<ref>[[Nevill Francis Mott|Mott, N.F.]], [[Harrie Massey|Massey, H.S.W.]] (1965/1971).

However, if the magnetic field is inhomogeneous then the force on one end of the dipole will be slightly greater than the opposing force on the other end, so that there is a net force which deflects the particle's trajectory. If the particles were classical spinning objects, one would expect the distribution of their spin angular momentum vectors to be [[Boltzmann distribution|random]] and [[random variable|continuous]]. Each particle would be deflected by an amount proportional to its magnetic moment, producing some density distribution on the detector screen. Instead, the particles passing through the Stern\u2013Gerlach apparatus are deflected either up or down by a specific amount. This was a measurement of the quantum [[observable]] now known as [[spin operator|spin]] angular momentum, which demonstrated possible outcomes of a measurement where the observable has a discrete set of values or [[point spectrum]].\n\nAlthough some discrete quantum phenomena, such as [[atomic spectra]], were observed much earlier, the Stern\u2013Gerlach experiment allowed scientists to observe separation between discrete quantum states for the first time in the history of science.\n\nTheoretically, [[angular momentum operator#Quantization|quantum angular momentum ''of any kind'' has a discrete spectrum]], which is sometimes briefly expressed as \"angular momentum is [[Quantization (physics)|quantized]]\".\n\n=== Experiment using particles with +{{frac|1|2}} or \u2212{{frac|1|2}} spin ===\nIf the experiment is conducted using charged particles like electrons, there will be a [[Lorentz force]] that tends to bend the trajectory in a circle. This force can be cancelled by an electric field of appropriate magnitude oriented transverse to the charged particle's path.\n\n[[File:Quantum projection of S onto z for spin half particles.PNG|100px|left|thumb|Spin values for fermions]]\n\nElectrons are [[spin-\u00bd|spin-{{frac|1|2}}]] particles. These have only two possible spin angular momentum values measured along any axis, <math>+\\frac{\\hbar}{2}</math> or <math>-\\frac{\\hbar}{2}</math>, a purely quantum mechanical phenomenon. Because its value is always the same, it is regarded as an intrinsic property of electrons, and is sometimes known as \"intrinsic angular momentum\" (to distinguish it from orbital angular momentum, which can vary and depends on the presence of other particles). If one measures the spin along a vertical axis, electrons are described as \"spin up\" or \"spin down\", based on the magnetic moment pointing up or down, respectively.\n\nTo mathematically describe the experiment with spin <math>+\\frac{1}{2}</math> particles, it is easiest to use [[Paul Adrien Maurice Dirac|Dirac]]'s [[bra\u2013ket notation]]. As the particles pass through the Stern\u2013Gerlach device, they are deflected either up or down, and observed by the detector which resolves to either spin up or spin down. These are described by the angular momentum quantum number <math>j</math>, which can take on one of the two possible allowed values, either <math>+\\frac{\\hbar}{2}</math> or <math>-\\frac{\\hbar}{2}</math>. The act of observing (measuring) the momentum along the <math>z</math> axis corresponds to the operator <math>J_z</math>.{{specify|reason=How exactly does this operator look like?|date=February 2018}} In mathematical terms, the initial state of the particles is\n:<math>|\\psi\\rangle = c_1\\left|\\psi_{j = +\\frac{\\hbar}{2}}\\right\\rangle + c_2\\left|\\psi_{j = -\\frac{\\hbar}{2}}\\right\\rangle</math>\nwhere constants <math>c_1</math> and <math>c_2</math> are complex numbers. This initial state spin can point in any direction. The squares of the [[absolute value]]s \n<math>|c_1|^2</math> and <math>|c_2|^2</math> determine the probabilities that for a system in the initial state <math>|\\psi\\rangle</math> one of the two possible values of <math>j</math> is found after the measurement is made. The constants <math>c_1</math> and <math>c_2</math> must also be normalized in order that the probability of finding either one of the values be unity, that is we must ensure that <math>|c_1|^2 + |c_2|^2 = 1</math>. However, this information is not sufficient to determine the values of <math>c_1</math> and <math>c_2</math>, because they are complex numbers. Therefore, the measurement yields only the squared magnitudes of the constants, which are interpreted as probabilities.\n\n==Sequential experiments==\n{{Confusing section|reason=a detailed explanation of the picture may be beneficial to many readers|date=February 2018}}\n\nIf we link multiple Stern\u2013Gerlach apparatuses (the rectangles containing ''S-G''), we can clearly see that they do not act as simple selectors, i.e. filtering out particles with one of the states (pre-existing to the measurement) and blocking the others. Instead they alter the state by observing it (as in [[photon polarization|light polarization]]). In the figure below, x and z name the directions of the (inhomogenous) magnetic field, with the x-z-plane being orthogonal to the particle beam. In the three S-G systems shown below, the cross-hatched squares denote the blocking of a given output, i.e. each of the S-G systems with a blocker allows only particles with one of two states to enter the next S-G apparatus in the sequence.\n<ref name=Sakurai1985>\n{{cite book\n |first=J.-J. |last=Sakurai\n |title=Modern quantum mechanics\n |publisher=[[Addison-Wesley]]\n |year=1985\n |isbn=0-201-53929-2\n}}</ref>\n[[File:Sg-seq.svg|left|640px]]\n{{clear}}\n\nThe top illustation shows that when a second, identical, S-G apparatus is placed at the exit of the z+ beam resulting of the first apparatus, only z+ is seen in the output of the second apparatus. This result is expected since only the z+ beam from the first apparatus entered the second apparatus.\n\nThe middle system shows what happens when a different S-G apparatus is placed at the exit of the z+ beam resulting of the first apparatus, the second apparatus measuring the deflection of the beams on the x axis instead of the z axis. The second apparatus produces x+ and x- outputs. Now classically we would expect to have one beam with the x characteristic oriented + and the z characteristic oriented +, and another with the x characteristic oriented - and the z characteristic oriented +.\n\nThe bottom system contradicts that expectation. The output of the third apparatus which measures the deflection on the z axis again shows z- as well as z+. Given that the input to the second S-G apparatus consisted only of z+, it can be inferred that a S-G apparatus must be altering the states of the particles that pass through it. This experiment can be interpreted to exhibit the [[uncertainty principle]] : since the angular momentum cannot be measured on two perpendicular directions at the same time, the measurement of the angular momentum on the x direction destroys the previous determination of the angular momentum in the z direction. That's why the third apparatus measures renewed z+ and z- beams like the x measurement really made a clean slate of the z+ output.\n\n==History==\n[[File:SternGerlach2.jpg|thumb|A plaque at the Frankfurt institute commemorating the experiment]]\nThe Stern\u2013Gerlach experiment was conceived by [[Otto Stern]] in 1921 and performed by him and [[Walther Gerlach]] in [[Frankfurt]] in 1922.<ref name=Sakurai1985/> At the time, Stern was an assistant to [[Max Born]] at the [[Goethe University Frankfurt|University of Frankfurt]]'s [[Institute for Theoretical Physics (Frankfurt)|Institute for Theoretical Physics]],{{citation needed|date=February 2018}} and Gerlach was an assistant at the same university's [[Institute for Experimental Physics (Frankfurt)|Institute for Experimental Physics]].{{citation needed|date=February 2018}}\n\nAt the time of the experiment, the most prevalent model for describing the [[atom]] was the [[Bohr model]],{{citation needed|date=February 2018}} which described [[electrons]] as going around the positively charged [[Atomic nucleus|nucleus]] only in certain discrete [[atomic orbital]]s or [[energy levels]].

Grammatical differences between the two standards are minor but each uses its own script: Hindi uses [[Devanagari]] while Urdu uses [[Urdu alphabet|an extended form]] of the [[Perso-Arabic script]], typically in the [[Nasta\u02bfl\u012bq script|Nasta\u02bfl\u012bq]] style.\n\nOn this grammar page [[Hindustani language|Hindustani]] is written in \"standard [[oriental studies|orientalist]]\" [[Transcription (linguistics)|transcription]] as outlined in {{Harvcoltxt|Masica|1991|p=xv}}.

A [[hyphen]] symbol (for the marked type-I) denotes change from the original termination to another (for example ''la\u1e5bk\u0101'' to ''la\u1e5bke'' in the masculine singular oblique), whereas a [[Plus and minus signs|plus]] sign (for the unmarked type-II) denotes an ending which should be added (''seb'' to ''seb\u00f5'' in the masculine plural oblique).\n\n{|class=\"wikitable\" style=\"margin: 1em auto 1em auto;\"\n! rowspan=\"2\" colspan=\"2\"| !! colspan=\"2\"| Singular !! colspan=\"3\"| Plural\n|-\n!

It is their use with a noun or verb that necessitates the noun or verb taking the oblique case (though the bare oblique is also minorly used [[adverb]]ially<ref name=\"Shapiro2003p266\">{{Harvcoltxt|Shapiro|2003|p=266}}</ref>), and it is with them that the locus of grammatical function or \"case-marking\" then lies. There are seven such one-word primary postpositions:\n\n*''k\u0101'' \u2013 [[Genitive case|genitive]] marker; variably declinable in the manner of an adjective. X ''k\u0101/ke/k\u012b'' Y has the sense \"X's Y\", with ''k\u0101/ke/k\u012b'' agreeing with Y.<ref name=\"Shapiro2003p264\"/>\n*''ko'' \u2013 marks the indirect [[Object (grammar)|object]] (hence named  \"[[dative]] marker\"), ''or'', if [[definiteness|definite]] or animate, the direct object.<ref>{{Harvcoltxt|Snell|Weightman|1989|p=67}}</ref>\n*''ne'' \u2013 [[Ergative case|ergative]] marker; applied to [[Subject (grammar)|subject]]s of [[Transitivity (grammatical category)|transitive]] [[Perfective aspect|perfective]] [[verb]]s.\n*''se'' \u2013 [[Ablative case|ablative]] marker; has a very wide range of uses and meanings:\n**\"from\";  ''dill\u012b se'' \"from [[Delhi]]\".\n**\"from, of\"; ''{{IAST|tumse \u1e0darn\u0101}}'' \"to fear you\".\n**\"since\"; ''itv\u0101r se'' \"since Sunday\".\n**\"by, with\"; [[Instrumental case|instrumental]] marker.\n**\"by, with, -ly\"; [[adverb]]ial marker.\n**\"than\"; for [[comparative]]s.\n**a minority of verbs use ''se'' rather than ''ko'' to mark their [[Patient (grammar)|patient]]s.\n*''m\u1ebd'' \u2013 \"in\".\n*''par'' \u2013 \"on\".\n*''tak'' \u2013 \"until, up to\".\n\nBeyond these are a large range of compound postpositions, composed of the genitive primary postposition ''k\u0101'' in the oblique form (''ke'', ''k\u012b'') plus an adverb.\n\n*''k\u012b taraf'' \"towards\", ''ke andar'' \"inside\", ''ke \u0101ge'' \"in front of, ahead of\", ''ke \u016bpar'' \"on top of, above\", ''ke n\u012bce'' \"beneath, below\", ''ke p\u012bche'' \"behind\", ''ke b\u0101d'' \"after\", ''ke b\u0101re m\u1ebd'' \"about\", ''ke b\u0101har'' \"outside\", ''ke liye'' \"for\", ''ke s\u0101mne'' \"facing, opposite\", etc.<ref>{{Harvcoltxt|Snell|Weightman|1989|pp=80\u201381}}</ref>\n\n===Pronouns===\n\n====Personal====\nHindustani has [[personal pronoun]]s for the first and second persons, while for the third person [[demonstrative]]s are used, which can be categorized [[Deixis|deictically]] as proximate and non-proximate.<ref>{{Harvcoltxt|Shapiro|2003|pp=264\u2013265}}</ref> [[Pronoun]]s distinguish [[Grammatical case|case]]s of [[Direct case|direct]], [[Oblique case|oblique]], and [[dative]]. The lattermost, often called a set of \"[[Contraction (grammar)|contracted]]\" forms, is in free variation with the oblique case plus dative [[postposition]]. Pronouns do not distinguish [[Grammatical gender|gender]].\n\nAlso displayed in the below table are the [[genitive]] pronominal forms to show that the 1st and 2nd pronouns have their own distinctive forms of ''mer\u0101'', ''ham\u0101r\u0101'',  ''ter\u0101'', ''tumh\u0101r\u0101'' apart from the regular formula of <small>OBL.</small> + ''k\u0101''; as well as the [[ergative case|ergative]] pronominal forms to show that the postposition ''ne'' does not straightforwardly suffix the oblique bases: rather than *''mujh ne'' and *''tujh ne'', direct bases are used giving ''mai ne'' and ''t\u016b ne'', and rather than ''in ne'' and ''un ne'', it's ''inh\u00f5 ne'' and ''unh\u00f5 ne''.\n\n''t\u016b'', ''tum'', and ''\u0101p'' are the three second person pronouns (\"you\"), constituting a threefold scale of sociolinguistic formality: respectively \"intimate\", \"familiar\", and \"polite\". The \"intimate\" is grammatically singular while the \"familiar\" and \"polite\" are grammatically plural.<ref name=\"Shapiro 2003 265\"/> When being referred to in the third person however, only those of the \"polite\" level of formality are grammatically plural.<ref>{{Harvcoltxt|Snell|Weightman|1989|p=21}}</ref> The following table is adapted from {{Harvcoltxt|Shapiro|2003|p=265}}.\n\n{|class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n!rowspan=\"4\"|\n!colspan=\"5\"|Personal\n!colspan=\"4\"|Demonstrative\n!colspan=\"2\" rowspan=\"3\"|Relative\n!colspan=\"2\" rowspan=\"3\"|Interrogative\n|-\n!colspan=\"2\"|1st person\n!colspan=\"3\"|2nd person\n!colspan=\"4\"|3rd person\n|-\n!rowspan=\"2\"|Singular\n!rowspan=\"2\"|Plural\n!Singular\n!colspan=\"2\"|Plural\n!colspan=\"2\"|Proximal\n!colspan=\"2\"|Non-proximal\n|-\n!Intimate\n!Familiar\n!Polite\n!Singular\n!Plural\n!Singular\n!Plural\n!Singular\n!Plural\n!Singular\n!Plural\n|-\n!Direct\n|{{H:title|I|''m\u00e3\u0129''}}\n|rowspan=\"2\"|{{H:title|we/us|''ham''}}\n|{{H:title|thou|''t\u016b''}}\n|rowspan=\"2\"|{{H:title|you|''tum''}}\n|rowspan=\"2\"|{{H:title|you|''\u0101p''}}\n|colspan=\"2\"|{{H:title|he/she/it/this/they/these|''ye''}}||colspan=\"2\"|{{H:title|he/she/it/that/they/those|''vo''}}\n|colspan=\"2\"|{{H:title|[those] who/[those] that|''jo''}}\n|colspan=\"2\"|{{H:title|who(?)|''kaun''}}, {{H:title|what(?)|''ky\u0101''}}\n|-\n!Oblique\n|{{H:title|me|''mujh''}}||{{H:title|thee|''tujh''}}||{{H:title|him/her/it/this|''is''}}||{{H:title|them/these|''in''}}||{{H:title|him/her/it/that|''us''}}||{{H:title|them/those|''un''}}||{{H:title|[he/she] whom/[that] which|''jis''}}||{{H:title|[those] whom/[those] which|''jin''}}||{{H:title|whom(?)/what(?)|''kis''}}||{{H:title|whom(?)/which ones(?)|''kin''}}\n|-\n!Dative\n|{{H:title|to me|''mujhe''}}||{{H:title|to us|''ham\u1ebd''}}||{{H:title|to thee|''tujhe''}}||{{H:title|to you|''tumh\u1ebd''}}||{{H:title|to you|''\u0101p ko''}}||{{H:title|to him/to her/to it/to this|''ise''}}||{{H:title|to them/to these|''inh\u1ebd''}}||{{H:title|to him/to her/to it/to that|''use''}}||{{H:title|to them/to those|''unh\u1ebd''}}\n|{{H:title|[he/she] to whom/[that] to which|''jise''}}||{{H:title|[those] to whom/[those] to which|''jinh\u1ebd''}}||{{H:title|to whom(?)/to what(?)|''kise''}}||{{H:title|to whom(?)/to which ones(?)|''kinh\u1ebd''}}\n|-\n!Genitive\n|{{H:title|My/Mine|''mer\u0101''}}||{{H:title|our(s)|''ham\u0101r\u0101''}}||{{H:title|thy/thine|''ter\u0101''}}\n|{{H:title|your(s)|''tumh\u0101r\u0101''}}||{{H:title|your/s|''\u0101p k\u0101''}}\n|{{H:title|his/her(s)/its/of this|''is k\u0101''}}||{{H:title|their(s)/of these|''in k\u0101''}}||{{H:title|his/her(s)/its/of that|''us k\u0101''}}||{{H:title|their(s)/of those|''un k\u0101''}}\n|{{H:title|[he/she] whose|''jis k\u0101''}}||{{H:title|[those] whose|''jin k\u0101''}}||{{H:title|whose(?)/which one's(?)|''kis k\u0101''}}||{{H:title|whose(?)/which ones'(?)|''kin k\u0101''}}\n|-\n!Ergative\n|{{H:title|I (have/had done something to an object)|''m\u00e3\u0129 ne''}}||{{H:title|we (have/had done something to an object)|''ham ne''}}||{{H:title|thou (hast/hadst done something to an object)|''t\u016b ne''}}||{{H:title|you (have/had done something to an object)|''tum ne''}}||{{H:title|you (have/had done something to an object)|''\u0101p ne''}}||{{H:title|he/she/it/this (has/had done something to an object)|''is ne''}}||{{H:title|they/these (have/had done something to an object)|''inh\u00f5 ne''}}\n|{{H:title|he/she/it/that (has/had done something to an object)|''us ne''}}||{{H:title|they/those (have/had done something to an object)|''unh\u00f5 ne''}}||{{H:title|[he/she] who/[that] which  (has/had done something to an object)|''jis ne''}}||{{H:title|[those] who/[those] that (have/had done something to an object)|''jinh\u00f5 ne''}}||{{H:title|who/what (has/had done something to an object?)|''kis ne''}}||{{H:title|who/which ones (has/have/had done something to an object?)|''kinh\u00f5 ne''}}\n|}\nNotes for pronouns:\n*Postpositions are treated as [[bound morpheme]]s after pronouns in Hindi, but as separate words in Urdu.<ref name=\"Schmidt2003p293\">{{Harvcoltxt|Schmidt|2003|p=293}}</ref> \n*The varying forms for the 3rd pn. dir. constitute one of the small number of grammatical differences between Hindi and Urdu. ''yah'' \"this\" / ''ye'' \"these\" / ''vah'' \"that\" / ''ve'' \"those\" is the ''literary'' set for Hindi while ''ye'' \"this, these\" / ''vo'' \"that, those\" is the set for Urdu and ''spoken'' (and also often written) Hindi.\n*The above [[Hindustani grammar#Postpositions|section on postpositions]] noted that ''ko'' (the dative case) marks direct objects if [[definiteness|definite]]. As \"the most specific thing of all is an individual\", persons (or their pronouns) nearly always take the dative case or postposition.<ref>{{Harvcoltxt|Snell|Weightman|1989|p=68}}</ref>\n*it is very common practice to use plural pronouns (and their accompanying conjugation) in polite situations, thus ''tum'' can be used in the second person when referring to one person. Similarly, some speakers prefer plural ''ham'' over singular ''m\u00e3\u0129''. This is usually not quite the same as the \"[[Pluralis majestatis|royal we]]\"; it is rather colloquial.<ref>{{Harvcoltxt|Snell|Weightman|1989|p=106}}</ref>\n*''ko\u012b'' and ''kuch'' are [[indefinite pronoun]]s/[[Quantifier (linguistics)|quantifier]]s. As pronouns ''ko\u012b'' is used for [[Animacy|animate]]s (\"someone\") and ''kuch'' for inanimates (\"something\").<ref>{{Harvcoltxt|Snell|Weightman|1989|p=88}}</ref> As quantifiers/adjectives ''ko\u012b'' is used for singular [[count noun]]s and ''kuch'' for [[mass noun]]s and plural count nouns. ''ko\u012b'' takes the form ''kis\u012b'' in the oblique. The form ''ka\u012b'' \"several\" is partially a plural equivalent to ''ko\u012b''.<ref>{{Harvcoltxt|Snell|Weightman|1989|p=89}}</ref> ''kuch'' can also act as an [[adverb]], qualifying an adjective, meaning \"rather\". ''ko\u012b'' preceding a number takes the meaning of \"about, approximately\". In this usage it does not oblique to ''kis\u012b''.<ref>{{Harvcoltxt|Snell|Weightman|1989|p=90}}</ref>\n*''apn\u0101'' is a (genitive) [[reflexive pronoun]]: \"my/your/etc. (own)\".<ref>{{Harvcoltxt|Snell|Weightman|1989|p=79}}</ref> Using non-reflexive and reflexive together gives emphasis; e.g. ''mer\u0101 apn\u0101'' \"my (very) own\".<ref>{{Harvcoltxt|Snell|Weightman|1989|p=80}}</ref> ''xud'', ''\u0101p'', and ''svayam'' are some (direct; non-genitive) others: \"my/your/etc.-self\".<ref>{{Harvcoltxt|Snell|Weightman|1989|p=198}}</ref> Bases for oblique usage are usually ''apne'' or ''apne \u0101p''. The latter alone can also mean \"of one's own accord\"; ''\u0101pas m\u1ebd'' means \"among/between themselves\".<ref>{{Harvcoltxt|Snell|Weightman|1989|p=199}}</ref>\n\n====Derivates====\n{|class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n! rowspan=\"2\"| !! rowspan=\"2\"|Interrogative !! rowspan=\"2\"|Relative !! colspan=\"2\"|Demonstrative\n|-\n!

Like the nominal system, the Hindustani verb involves successive layers of (inflectional) elements to the right of the [[Root (linguistics)|lexical base]].<ref>{{Harvcoltxt|Masica|1991|p=257}}</ref>\n\nHindustani has 3 aspects: [[perfective]], [[habitual]], and [[Continuous and progressive aspects|continuous]], each having overt morphological correlates.<ref name=\"Shapiro2003p266\"/> These are [[participle]] forms, inflecting for [[Grammatical gender|gender]] and [[Grammatical number|number]] by way of a vowel termination, like adjectives.<ref name=\"Schmidt2003p323\"/> The perfective, though displaying a \"number of irregularities and morphophonemic adjustments\", is the simplest, being just the [[Word stem|verb stem]] followed by the agreement vowel. The habitual forms from the [[imperfective]] participle; verb stem, plus -''t''-, then vowel. The continuous forms [[Periphrasis|periphrastic]]ally through [[compound verb|compound]]ing ([[Hindustani grammar#Compounds|see below]]) with the perfective of ''rahn\u0101'' \"to stay\".\n\nDerived from ''hon\u0101'' \"to be\" are five [[copula (linguistics)|copula]] forms: [[Present tense|present]], [[Past tense|past]], [[subjunctive]], presumptive, [[contrafactual]] ([[List of acronyms and initialisms: A#AK|aka]] \"past conditional\"). Used both in basic predicative/existential sentences and as [[Auxiliary verb|verbal auxiliaries]] to aspectual forms, these constitute the basis of tense and mood.\n\nNon-aspectual forms include the [[infinitive]], the [[Imperative mood|imperative]], and the [[conjunction (grammar)|conjunctive]]. Mentioned morphological conditions such the subjunctive, \"presumptive\", etc. are applicable to both copula roots for auxiliary usage with aspectual forms ''and'' to non-copula roots directly for often unspecified (non-aspectual) [[Finite verb|finite]] forms.\n\n[[Finite verb]]al [[Agreement (linguistics)|agreement]] is with the nominative [[Subject (grammar)|subject]], except in the ''[[Transitive verb|transitive]] perfective'', where it is with the [[direct object]], with the erstwhile subject taking the [[ergative case|ergative]] construction ''-ne'' (see [[Hindustani grammar#Postpositions|postpositions]] above). The perfective aspect thus displays [[split ergativity]].\n\nTabled below on the left are the paradigms for adjectival [[Agreement (linguistics)|concord]] (<sup>A</sup>), here only slightly different from that introduced [[Hindustani grammar#Adjectives|previously]]: the f. pl. can nasalize under certain conditions. To the right are the paradigms for [[Grammatical person|personal]] concord (<sup>P</sup>), used by the subjunctive.\n\n{|\n|-\n|\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center;\"\n! (A) !! Sg. !!

It is historically the remnant of the old perfective marker.<ref>{{Harvcoltxt|Schmidt|2003|pp=324}}</ref> The clusters are ''a + \u0101'', ''\u0101 + \u0101'', ''o + \u0101'', and ''\u012b + \u0101'', resulting in ''\u0101y\u0101'', ''ay\u0101'', ''oy\u0101'', ''iy\u0101''.<ref name=\"Schmidt2003p328\"/> e.g. ''kh\u0101'''y'''\u0101/kh\u0101'''y'''e/kh\u0101\u012b/kh\u0101\u012b\u0303'' (''kh\u0101''- \"eat\").\n*In addition, the combinations ''\u012b + \u012b'' and ''i + \u012b'' give ''\u012b''.<ref name=\"Schmidt2003p328\"/> e.g. ''piy\u0101/piye/p'''\u012b'''/p'''\u012b\u0303''''' (''p\u012b-'' \"drink\").\n*As stated, agreement in the transitive perfective is with the direct object, with the erstwhile subject taking the ergative postposition ''ne''.

''-\u0101''.<ref>{{Harvcoltxt|Snell|Weightman|1989|p=140}}</ref>\n*Is this regard, there are a small number of verbs that while perhaps logically transitive still do not take ''ne'' and continue to agree with the subject, in the perfective. e.g. ''l\u0101n\u0101'' \"to bring\", ''bh\u016bln\u0101'' \"to forget\", ''miln\u0101'' \"to meet\", etc.\n<!--- perhaps Ergative points belong to Syntax\nalso discuss: forms both intransitive/transitive\n--->\n*Besides supplying the copulas, ''hon\u0101'' \"to be\" can be used aspectually: ''hu\u0101'' \"happened, became\"; ''hot\u0101'' \"happens, becomes, is\"; ''ho rah\u0101'' \"happening, being\".\n*''-ke'' can be used as a colloquial alternative to ''-kar'' for the conjunctive participle of any verb.

While the derivation of such forms shows patterns, they do reach a level of variegation so as to make it somewhat difficult to outline all-encompassing rules. Furthermore, some sets may have as many as four to five distinct members; also, the meaning of certain members of given sets may be idiosyncratic.<ref>{{Harvcoltxt|Shapiro|2003|p=270}}</ref>\n\nStarting from intransitive or transitive verb stems further transitive/causative stems are produced according to these assorted rules \u2014\n:1a. Root vowel change: ''a'' \u2192 ''\u0101'', ''u/\u016b'' \u2192 ''o'', ''i/\u012b'' \u2192 ''e''. Sometimes accompanied by root final consonant change: ''k'' \u2192 ''c'', ''{{IAST|\u1e6d}}'' \u2192 ''{{IAST|\u1e5b}}'', ''l'' \u2192 ''\u00d8''.\n:1b. Suffixation of ''-\u0101''.

Suffixation of ''-v\u0101'' (in place of ''-\u0101'' if and where it'd occur) for a \"causative\".\n\nThe majority of the following are sets culled from {{Harvcoltxt|Shapiro|2003|p=270}} and {{Harvcoltxt|Snell|Weightman|1989|pp=243\u2013244}}. The lack of third members displayed for the ''gh\u016bmn\u0101'' to ''dhuln\u0101'' sets does not imply that they do not exist but that they were simply not listed in the source literature {{Harvcol|Snell|Weightman|1989|p=243}}.

Considerable attention has been paid by scholars to determining the {{sic|semnatic}} properties contributed by the election of particle V2 verbs for use in particular compounds. In many cases the meaning contributed by V2 element bears scant resemblance to the literal meaning of the V2 element when it occurs as an independent verb. Thus for example, it is not possible to explain the semantic difference between uThnA \"to rise, get up\" and uTh baiThnA \"to get up suddenly, to spring up\" in terms of the semantics of baiThnA \"to sit down\".\n--->\n[[Compound verb]]s, a highly visible feature of Hindi\u2013Urdu grammar, consist of a verbal stem plus an [[auxiliary verb]]. The auxiliary (variously called \"subsidiary\", \"explicator verb\", and \"vector\"<ref name=\"Shapiro2003p269\">{{Harvcoltxt|Shapiro|2003|p=269}}</ref>) loses its own independent meaning and instead \"lends a certain shade of meaning\"<ref>{{Harvcoltxt|Snell|Weightman|1989|p=154}}</ref> to the main or stem verb, which \"comprises the lexical core of the compound\".<ref name=\"Shapiro2003p269\"/> While almost any verb can act as a main verb, there is a limited set of productive auxiliaries.<ref>{{Harvcoltxt|Shapiro|2003|pp=269\u2013270}}</ref> Shown below are prominent such auxiliaries, with their independent meaning first outlined, followed by their semantic contribution as auxiliaries.\n\n*''j\u0101n\u0101'' \"to go\"; gives a sense of completeness, finality, or change of state. e.g. ''\u0101n\u0101'' \"to come\" \u2192 ''\u0101 j\u0101n\u0101'' \"to come, arrive\"; ''kh\u0101n\u0101'' \"to eat\" \u2192 ''kh\u0101 j\u0101n\u0101'' \"to eat up\"; ''p\u012bn\u0101'' \"to drink\" \u2192 ''p\u012b j\u0101n\u0101'' \"to drink up\"; ''{{IAST|bai\u1e6dhn\u0101}}'' \"to sit\" \u2192 ''{{IAST|bai\u1e6dh j\u0101n\u0101}}'' \"to sit down\"; ''samajhn\u0101'' \"to understand\" \u2192 ''samajh j\u0101n\u0101'' \"to realise\"; ''son\u0101'' \"to sleep\" \u2192 ''so j\u0101n\u0101'' \"to go to sleep\"; ''hon\u0101'' \"to be\" \u2192 ''ho j\u0101n\u0101'' \"to become, happen\".<ref>{{Harvcoltxt|Snell|Weightman|1989|pp=155}}</ref>\n*''len\u0101'' \"to take\"; suggests that the benefit of the action flows towards the doer. e.g. ''{{IAST|pa\u1e5bh len\u0101}}'' \"to read (to/for oneself)\".<ref name=\"Snell&Weightman1989p156\">{{Harvcoltxt|Snell|Weightman|1989|pp=156}}</ref>\n*''den\u0101'' \"to give\"; suggests that the benefit of the action flows away from the doer. e.g. ''{{IAST|pa\u1e5bh den\u0101}}'' \"to read (out)\".<ref name=\"Snell&Weightman1989p156\"/>\n\nThe above three are the most common of auxiliaries, and the \"least marked\", or \"lexically nearly colourless\".<ref name=\"Schmidt2003p337\">{{Harvcoltxt|Schmidt|2003|pp=337}}</ref> The nuance conveyed by an auxiliary can often be very subtle, and need not always be expressed with different words in English translation.

It is formed from the perfective participle by addition of the auxiliary ''j\u0101n\u0101'' \"to go\"; i.e. ''likhn\u0101'' \"to write\" \u2192 ''likh\u0101 j\u0101n\u0101'' \"to be written\". The agent is marked by the postposition ''se''. Furthermore, both intransitive and transitive verbs may be grammatically passivized to show physical/psychological incapacity, usually in negative sentences. Lastly, intransitives often have a passive sense, or convey unintentional action.<ref>{{Harvcoltxt|Schmidt|2003|p=331}}</ref>\n\n==Syntax==\nHindustani is an [[subject\u2013object\u2013verb|SOV]] language. It is neither purely left- or right-[[Branching (linguistics)|branching]], and phenomena of both types can be found. The order of constituents in sentences as a whole lacks governing \"hard and fast rules\", and frequent deviations can be found from normative word position, describable in terms of a small number of rules, accounting for facts beyond the pale of the label of \"SOV\".<ref>{{Harvcoltxt|Shapiro|2003|p=271}}</ref>\n\n# Indirect objects precede direct objects.\n# Attributive adjectives precede the noun they qualify.\n# Adverbs precede the adjectives they qualify.\n# Negative markers (''nah\u012b\u0303, na, mat'') and interrogatives precede the verb.\n# Interrogatives precede negative markers if both are present.\n# ''ky\u0101'' (\"what?\") as the [[yes-no question]] marker occurs at the ''beginning'' of a clause.\n\n===Possession===\nPossession, reflecting what many other languages indicate via the verb ''to have'', is reflected in Hindustani by the genitive ''k\u0101'' (inflected appropriately) or the postposition ''ke p\u0101s'' (\"near\") and the verb ''hon\u0101''. Possible objects of possession (nouns) fall into two main categories in Hindustani: one for persons such as family members, or body parts, and the other for most inanimate objects, animals, most abstract ideas, and some persons such as servants.\n\n* For indicating possession with objects of the first category, ''k\u0101'' appears after the subject of the possession, followed by the object. With personal pronouns, this requires the use of the possessive pronoun (inflected appropriately). Examples: ''Mer\u012b m\u0101t\u0101 hai'' (\"I have a mother\"), ''\u015aiv k\u012b t\u012bn \u0101\u0303kh\u1ebd ha\u0129'' (\"Shiva has three eyes\").\n* For indicating possession with objects of the second category, the compound postposition ''ke p\u0101s'' (\"near\") is used. For example: ''Mohan ke p\u0101s ek bakr\u012b hai'' (\"Mohan has a goat\", but also \"There is a goat near Mohan\").\n\n===Relativization===\nRather than using relative clauses after nouns, as in English, Hindustani uses correlative clauses. A correlative clause goes before the entire clause, rather than being embedded in the clause next to the noun it relativizes. For example, the following sentence means, \"The girl who is standing is is tall.\"<ref>https://ojs.ub.uni-konstanz.de/jsal/index.php/fasal/article/view/109/67</ref>\n\nJo la\u1e5bk\u012b kha\u1e5b\u012b hai, vo lamb\u012b hai.\n\nwhich girl.F.SG standing.F.SG be.PRS.3.SG., that tall.F.SG be.PRS.SG.\n\nModern Hindi also uses post-noun relative clauses which are similar to English. This may be the result of English influence on the language.<ref>https://brill.com/view/journals/jlc/4/2/article-p250_4.xml</ref>\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|3}}\n\n==Bibliography==\n*{{Citation\n |last=Masica\n |first=Colin\n |authorlink=Colin Masica\n |year=1991\n |title=The Indo-Aryan Languages\n|place= Cambridge\n |publisher=Cambridge University Press\n |isbn=978-0-521-29944-2\n |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=J3RSHWePhXwC&printsec=frontcover&dq=indo-aryan+languages\n}}.\n*{{Citation\n |last=Schmidt\n |first=Ruth Laila\n |year=2003\n |chapter=Urdu\n |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=jPR2OlbTbdkC&pg=PA286&dq=indo-aryan&sig=BWUDFSCrQPgfbEznzUZcq7B2HnE\n|editor1-last= Cardona\n|editor1-first= George\n|editor2-last= Jain\n|editor2-first= Dhanesh\n |title=The Indo-Aryan Languages\n |publisher=Routledge\n |isbn=978-0-415-77294-5\n |pages=286\u2013350\n}}.\n*{{Citation\n |last=McGregor\n |first=Ronald Stuart\n |year=1995\n |title=Outline of Hindi Grammar\n |publisher=Clarendon Press\n|place=Oxford\n |edition=third\n |isbn=0-19-870008-3\n}}.\n*{{Citation\n |last=Shapiro\n |first=Michael C.\n |year=2003\n |chapter=Hindi\n |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=jPR2OlbTbdkC&pg=PA250&dq=indo-aryan&sig=cUNurxJKkTLfKf8uiMd7pWX2RC0\n|editor1-last= Cardona\n|editor1-first= George\n|editor2-last= Jain\n|editor2-first= Dhanesh\n |title=The Indo-Aryan Languages\n |publisher=Routledge\n |isbn=978-0-415-77294-5\n |pages=250\u2013285\n}}.\n*{{Citation\n|last1= Snell\n|first1= Rupert\n|last2= Weightman\n|first2= Simon\n |year=1989\n |title=[[Teach Yourself]] Hindi\n |publisher=McGraw-Hill\n |edition=2003\n |isbn=978-0-07-142012-9\n}}.\n\n==Further reading==\n*{{citebook|url=https://archive.org/stream/introductiontohi00shakrich#page/8/mode/2up|title=An introduction to the Hindustani language comprising a grammar, and a vocabulary, English and Hindustani : also short stories and dialogues, short stories in Persian and Nagari characters ... and military words of command, Nagari and English|author=Shakespear, John, (1775-1858).|publisher=London : W.H.

It is their use with a noun or verb that necessitates the noun or verb taking the oblique case (though the bare oblique is also minorly used [[adverb]]ially<ref name=\"Shapiro2003p266\">{{Harvcoltxt|Shapiro|2003|p=266}}</ref>), and it is with them that the locus of grammatical function or \"case-marking\" then lies. There are seven such one-word primary postpositions:\n\n*''k\u0101'' \u2013 [[Genitive case|genitive]] marker; variably declinable in the manner of an adjective. X ''k\u0101/ke/k\u012b'' Y has the sense \"X's Y\", with ''k\u0101/ke/k\u012b'' agreeing with Y.<ref name=\"Shapiro2003p264\"/>\n*''ko'' \u2013 marks the indirect [[Object (grammar)|object]] (hence named  \"[[dative]] marker\"), ''or'', if [[definiteness|definite]] or animate, the direct object.<ref>{{Harvcoltxt|Snell|Weightman|1989|p=67}}</ref>\n*''ne'' \u2013 [[Ergative case|ergative]] marker; applied to [[Subject (grammar)|subject]]s of [[Transitivity (grammatical category)|transitive]] [[Perfective aspect|perfective]] [[verb]]s.\n*''se'' \u2013 [[Ablative case|ablative]] marker; has a very wide range of uses and meanings:\n**\"from\";  ''dill\u012b se'' \"from [[Delhi]]\".\n**\"from, of\"; ''{{IAST|tumse \u1e0darn\u0101}}'' \"to fear you\".\n**\"since\"; ''itv\u0101r se'' \"since Sunday\".\n**\"by, with\"; [[Instrumental case|instrumental]] marker.\n**\"by, with, -ly\"; [[adverb]]ial marker.\n**\"than\"; for [[comparative]]s.\n**a minority of verbs use ''se'' rather than ''ko'' to mark their [[Patient (grammar)|patient]]s.\n*''m\u1ebd'' \u2013 \"in\".\n*''par'' \u2013 \"on\".\n*''tak'' \u2013 \"until, up to\".\n\nBeyond these are a large range of compound postpositions, composed of the genitive primary postposition ''k\u0101'' in the oblique form (''ke'', ''k\u012b'') plus an adverb.\n\n*''k\u012b taraf'' \"towards\", ''ke andar'' \"inside\", ''ke \u0101ge'' \"in front of, ahead of\", ''ke \u016bpar'' \"on top of, above\", ''ke n\u012bce'' \"beneath, below\", ''ke p\u012bche'' \"behind\", ''ke b\u0101d'' \"after\", ''ke b\u0101re m\u1ebd'' \"about\", ''ke b\u0101har'' \"outside\", ''ke liye'' \"for\", ''ke s\u0101mne'' \"facing, opposite\", etc.<ref>{{Harvcoltxt|Snell|Weightman|1989|pp=80\u201381}}</ref>\n\n===Pronouns===\n\n====Personal====\nHindustani has [[personal pronoun]]s for the first and second persons, while for the third person [[demonstrative]]s are used, which can be categorized [[Deixis|deictically]] as proximate and non-proximate.<ref>{{Harvcoltxt|Shapiro|2003|pp=264\u2013265}}</ref> [[Pronoun]]s distinguish [[Grammatical case|case]]s of [[Direct case|direct]], [[Oblique case|oblique]], and [[dative]]. The lattermost, often called a set of \"[[Contraction (grammar)|contracted]]\" forms, is in free variation with the oblique case plus dative [[postposition]]. Pronouns do not distinguish [[Grammatical gender|gender]].\n\nAlso displayed in the below table are the [[genitive]] pronominal forms to show that the 1st and 2nd pronouns have their own distinctive forms of ''mer\u0101'', ''ham\u0101r\u0101'',  ''ter\u0101'', ''tumh\u0101r\u0101'' apart from the regular formula of <small>OBL.</small> + ''k\u0101''; as well as the [[ergative case|ergative]] pronominal forms to show that the postposition ''ne'' does not straightforwardly suffix the oblique bases: rather than *''mujh ne'' and *''tujh ne'', direct bases are used giving ''mai ne'' and ''t\u016b ne'', and rather than ''in ne'' and ''un ne'', it's ''inh\u00f5 ne'' and ''unh\u00f5 ne''.\n\n''t\u016b'', ''tum'', and ''\u0101p'' are the three second person pronouns (\"you\"), constituting a threefold scale of sociolinguistic formality: respectively \"intimate\", \"familiar\", and \"polite\". The \"intimate\" is grammatically singular while the \"familiar\" and \"polite\" are grammatically plural.<ref name=\"Shapiro 2003 265\"/> When being referred to in the third person however, only those of the \"polite\" level of formality are grammatically plural.<ref>{{Harvcoltxt|Snell|Weightman|1989|p=21}}</ref> The following table is adapted from {{Harvcoltxt|Shapiro|2003|p=265}}.\n\n{|class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n!rowspan=\"4\"|\n!colspan=\"5\"|Personal\n!colspan=\"4\"|Demonstrative\n!colspan=\"2\" rowspan=\"3\"|Relative\n!colspan=\"2\" rowspan=\"3\"|Interrogative\n|-\n!colspan=\"2\"|1st person\n!colspan=\"3\"|2nd person\n!colspan=\"4\"|3rd person\n|-\n!rowspan=\"2\"|Singular\n!rowspan=\"2\"|Plural\n!Singular\n!colspan=\"2\"|Plural\n!colspan=\"2\"|Proximal\n!colspan=\"2\"|Non-proximal\n|-\n!Intimate\n!Familiar\n!Polite\n!Singular\n!Plural\n!Singular\n!Plural\n!Singular\n!Plural\n!Singular\n!Plural\n|-\n!Direct\n|{{H:title|I|''m\u00e3\u0129''}}\n|rowspan=\"2\"|{{H:title|we/us|''ham''}}\n|{{H:title|thou|''t\u016b''}}\n|rowspan=\"2\"|{{H:title|you|''tum''}}\n|rowspan=\"2\"|{{H:title|you|''\u0101p''}}\n|colspan=\"2\"|{{H:title|he/she/it/this/they/these|''ye''}}||colspan=\"2\"|{{H:title|he/she/it/that/they/those|''vo''}}\n|colspan=\"2\"|{{H:title|[those] who/[those] that|''jo''}}\n|colspan=\"2\"|{{H:title|who(?)|''kaun''}}, {{H:title|what(?)|''ky\u0101''}}\n|-\n!Oblique\n|{{H:title|me|''mujh''}}||{{H:title|thee|''tujh''}}||{{H:title|him/her/it/this|''is''}}||{{H:title|them/these|''in''}}||{{H:title|him/her/it/that|''us''}}||{{H:title|them/those|''un''}}||{{H:title|[he/she] whom/[that] which|''jis''}}||{{H:title|[those] whom/[those] which|''jin''}}||{{H:title|whom(?)/what(?)|''kis''}}||{{H:title|whom(?)/which ones(?)|''kin''}}\n|-\n!Dative\n|{{H:title|to me|''mujhe''}}||{{H:title|to us|''ham\u1ebd''}}||{{H:title|to thee|''tujhe''}}||{{H:title|to you|''tumh\u1ebd''}}||{{H:title|to you|''\u0101p ko''}}||{{H:title|to him/to her/to it/to this|''ise''}}||{{H:title|to them/to these|''inh\u1ebd''}}||{{H:title|to him/to her/to it/to that|''use''}}||{{H:title|to them/to those|''unh\u1ebd''}}\n|{{H:title|[he/she] to whom/[that] to which|''jise''}}||{{H:title|[those] to whom/[those] to which|''jinh\u1ebd''}}||{{H:title|to whom(?)/to what(?)|''kise''}}||{{H:title|to whom(?)/to which ones(?)|''kinh\u1ebd''}}\n|-\n!Genitive\n|{{H:title|My/Mine|''mer\u0101''}}||{{H:title|our(s)|''ham\u0101r\u0101''}}||{{H:title|thy/thine|''ter\u0101''}}\n|{{H:title|your(s)|''tumh\u0101r\u0101''}}||{{H:title|your/s|''\u0101p k\u0101''}}\n|{{H:title|his/her(s)/its/of this|''is k\u0101''}}||{{H:title|their(s)/of these|''in k\u0101''}}||{{H:title|his/her(s)/its/of that|''us k\u0101''}}||{{H:title|their(s)/of those|''un k\u0101''}}\n|{{H:title|[he/she] whose|''jis k\u0101''}}||{{H:title|[those] whose|''jin k\u0101''}}||{{H:title|whose(?)/which one's(?)|''kis k\u0101''}}||{{H:title|whose(?)/which ones'(?)|''kin k\u0101''}}\n|-\n!Ergative\n|{{H:title|I (have/had done something to an object)|''m\u00e3\u0129 ne''}}||{{H:title|we (have/had done something to an object)|''ham ne''}}||{{H:title|thou (hast/hadst done something to an object)|''t\u016b ne''}}||{{H:title|you (have/had done something to an object)|''tum ne''}}||{{H:title|you (have/had done something to an object)|''\u0101p ne''}}||{{H:title|he/she/it/this (has/had done something to an object)|''is ne''}}||{{H:title|they/these (have/had done something to an object)|''inh\u00f5 ne''}}\n|{{H:title|he/she/it/that (has/had done something to an object)|''us ne''}}||{{H:title|they/those (have/had done something to an object)|''unh\u00f5 ne''}}||{{H:title|[he/she] who/[that] which  (has/had done something to an object)|''jis ne''}}||{{H:title|[those] who/[those] that (have/had done something to an object)|''jinh\u00f5 ne''}}||{{H:title|who/what (has/had done something to an object?)|''kis ne''}}||{{H:title|who/which ones (has/have/had done something to an object?)|''kinh\u00f5 ne''}}\n|}\nNotes for pronouns:\n*Postpositions are treated as [[bound morpheme]]s after pronouns in Hindi, but as separate words in Urdu.<ref name=\"Schmidt2003p293\">{{Harvcoltxt|Schmidt|2003|p=293}}</ref> \n*The varying forms for the 3rd pn. dir. constitute one of the small number of grammatical differences between Hindi and Urdu. ''yah'' \"this\" / ''ye'' \"these\" / ''vah'' \"that\" / ''ve'' \"those\" is the ''literary'' set for Hindi while ''ye'' \"this, these\" / ''vo'' \"that, those\" is the set for Urdu and ''spoken'' (and also often written) Hindi.\n*The above [[Hindustani grammar#Postpositions|section on postpositions]] noted that ''ko'' (the dative case) marks direct objects if [[definiteness|definite]]. As \"the most specific thing of all is an individual\", persons (or their pronouns) nearly always take the dative case or postposition.<ref>{{Harvcoltxt|Snell|Weightman|1989|p=68}}</ref>\n*it is very common practice to use plural pronouns (and their accompanying conjugation) in polite situations, thus ''tum'' can be used in the second person when referring to one person. Similarly, some speakers prefer plural ''ham'' over singular ''m\u00e3\u0129''. This is usually not quite the same as the \"[[Pluralis majestatis|royal we]]\"; it is rather colloquial.<ref>{{Harvcoltxt|Snell|Weightman|1989|p=106}}</ref>\n*''ko\u012b'' and ''kuch'' are [[indefinite pronoun]]s/[[Quantifier (linguistics)|quantifier]]s. As pronouns ''ko\u012b'' is used for [[Animacy|animate]]s (\"someone\") and ''kuch'' for inanimates (\"something\").<ref>{{Harvcoltxt|Snell|Weightman|1989|p=88}}</ref> As quantifiers/adjectives ''ko\u012b'' is used for singular [[count noun]]s and ''kuch'' for [[mass noun]]s and plural count nouns. ''ko\u012b'' takes the form ''kis\u012b'' in the oblique. The form ''ka\u012b'' \"several\" is partially a plural equivalent to ''ko\u012b''.<ref>{{Harvcoltxt|Snell|Weightman|1989|p=89}}</ref> ''kuch'' can also act as an [[adverb]], qualifying an adjective, meaning \"rather\". ''ko\u012b'' preceding a number takes the meaning of \"about, approximately\". In this usage it does not oblique to ''kis\u012b''.<ref>{{Harvcoltxt|Snell|Weightman|1989|p=90}}</ref>\n*''apn\u0101'' is a (genitive) [[reflexive pronoun]]: \"my/your/etc. (own)\".<ref>{{Harvcoltxt|Snell|Weightman|1989|p=79}}</ref> Using non-reflexive and reflexive together gives emphasis; e.g. ''mer\u0101 apn\u0101'' \"my (very) own\".<ref>{{Harvcoltxt|Snell|Weightman|1989|p=80}}</ref> ''xud'', ''\u0101p'', and ''svayam'' are some (direct; non-genitive) others: \"my/your/etc.-self\".<ref>{{Harvcoltxt|Snell|Weightman|1989|p=198}}</ref> Bases for oblique usage are usually ''apne'' or ''apne \u0101p''.

Like the nominal system, the Hindustani verb involves successive layers of (inflectional) elements to the right of the [[Root (linguistics)|lexical base]].<ref>{{Harvcoltxt|Masica|1991|p=257}}</ref>\n\nHindustani has 3 aspects: [[perfective]], [[habitual]], and [[Continuous and progressive aspects|continuous]], each having overt morphological correlates.<ref name=\"Shapiro2003p266\"/> These are [[participle]] forms, inflecting for [[Grammatical gender|gender]] and [[Grammatical number|number]] by way of a vowel termination, like adjectives.<ref name=\"Schmidt2003p323\"/> The perfective, though displaying a \"number of irregularities and morphophonemic adjustments\", is the simplest, being just the [[Word stem|verb stem]] followed by the agreement vowel. The habitual forms from the [[imperfective]] participle; verb stem, plus -''t''-, then vowel. The continuous forms [[Periphrasis|periphrastic]]ally through [[compound verb|compound]]ing ([[Hindustani grammar#Compounds|see below]]) with the perfective of ''rahn\u0101'' \"to stay\".\n\nDerived from ''hon\u0101'' \"to be\" are five [[copula (linguistics)|copula]] forms: [[Present tense|present]], [[Past tense|past]], [[subjunctive]], presumptive, [[contrafactual]] ([[List of acronyms and initialisms: A#AK|aka]] \"past conditional\"). Used both in basic predicative/existential sentences and as [[Auxiliary verb|verbal auxiliaries]] to aspectual forms, these constitute the basis of tense and mood.\n\nNon-aspectual forms include the [[infinitive]], the [[Imperative mood|imperative]], and the [[conjunction (grammar)|conjunctive]]. Mentioned morphological conditions such the subjunctive, \"presumptive\", etc. are applicable to both copula roots for auxiliary usage with aspectual forms ''and'' to non-copula roots directly for often unspecified (non-aspectual) [[Finite verb|finite]] forms.\n\n[[Finite verb]]al [[Agreement (linguistics)|agreement]] is with the nominative [[Subject (grammar)|subject]], except in the ''[[Transitive verb|transitive]] perfective'', where it is with the [[direct object]], with the erstwhile subject taking the [[ergative case|ergative]] construction ''-ne'' (see [[Hindustani grammar#Postpositions|postpositions]] above). The perfective aspect thus displays [[split ergativity]].\n\nTabled below on the left are the paradigms for adjectival [[Agreement (linguistics)|concord]] (<sup>A</sup>), here only slightly different from that introduced [[Hindustani grammar#Adjectives|previously]]: the f. pl. can nasalize under certain conditions.

It is historically the remnant of the old perfective marker.<ref>{{Harvcoltxt|Schmidt|2003|pp=324}}</ref> The clusters are ''a + \u0101'', ''\u0101 + \u0101'', ''o + \u0101'', and ''\u012b + \u0101'', resulting in ''\u0101y\u0101'', ''ay\u0101'', ''oy\u0101'', ''iy\u0101''.<ref name=\"Schmidt2003p328\"/> e.g. ''kh\u0101'''y'''\u0101/kh\u0101'''y'''e/kh\u0101\u012b/kh\u0101\u012b\u0303'' (''kh\u0101''- \"eat\").\n*In addition, the combinations ''\u012b + \u012b'' and ''i + \u012b'' give ''\u012b''.<ref name=\"Schmidt2003p328\"/> e.g. ''piy\u0101/piye/p'''\u012b'''/p'''\u012b\u0303''''' (''p\u012b-'' \"drink\").\n*As stated, agreement in the transitive perfective is with the direct object, with the erstwhile subject taking the ergative postposition ''ne''.

''-\u0101''.<ref>{{Harvcoltxt|Snell|Weightman|1989|p=140}}</ref>\n*Is this regard, there are a small number of verbs that while perhaps logically transitive still do not take ''ne'' and continue to agree with the subject, in the perfective. e.g. ''l\u0101n\u0101'' \"to bring\", ''bh\u016bln\u0101'' \"to forget\", ''miln\u0101'' \"to meet\", etc.\n<!--- perhaps Ergative points belong to Syntax\nalso discuss: forms both intransitive/transitive\n--->\n*Besides supplying the copulas, ''hon\u0101'' \"to be\" can be used aspectually: ''hu\u0101'' \"happened, became\"; ''hot\u0101'' \"happens, becomes, is\"; ''ho rah\u0101'' \"happening, being\".\n*''-ke'' can be used as a colloquial alternative to ''-kar'' for the conjunctive participle of any verb.

While the derivation of such forms shows patterns, they do reach a level of variegation so as to make it somewhat difficult to outline all-encompassing rules. Furthermore, some sets may have as many as four to five distinct members; also, the meaning of certain members of given sets may be idiosyncratic.<ref>{{Harvcoltxt|Shapiro|2003|p=270}}</ref>\n\nStarting from intransitive or transitive verb stems further transitive/causative stems are produced according to these assorted rules \u2014\n:1a. Root vowel change: ''a'' \u2192 ''\u0101'', ''u/\u016b'' \u2192 ''o'', ''i/\u012b'' \u2192 ''e''. Sometimes accompanied by root final consonant change: ''k'' \u2192 ''c'', ''{{IAST|\u1e6d}}'' \u2192 ''{{IAST|\u1e5b}}'', ''l'' \u2192 ''\u00d8''.\n:1b. Suffixation of ''-\u0101''.

Suffixation of ''-v\u0101'' (in place of ''-\u0101'' if and where it'd occur) for a \"causative\".\n\nThe majority of the following are sets culled from {{Harvcoltxt|Shapiro|2003|p=270}} and {{Harvcoltxt|Snell|Weightman|1989|pp=243\u2013244}}. The lack of third members displayed for the ''gh\u016bmn\u0101'' to ''dhuln\u0101'' sets does not imply that they do not exist but that they were simply not listed in the source literature {{Harvcol|Snell|Weightman|1989|p=243}}.

Considerable attention has been paid by scholars to determining the {{sic|semnatic}} properties contributed by the election of particle V2 verbs for use in particular compounds. In many cases the meaning contributed by V2 element bears scant resemblance to the literal meaning of the V2 element when it occurs as an independent verb. Thus for example, it is not possible to explain the semantic difference between uThnA \"to rise, get up\" and uTh baiThnA \"to get up suddenly, to spring up\" in terms of the semantics of baiThnA \"to sit down\".\n--->\n[[Compound verb]]s, a highly visible feature of Hindi\u2013Urdu grammar, consist of a verbal stem plus an [[auxiliary verb]]. The auxiliary (variously called \"subsidiary\", \"explicator verb\", and \"vector\"<ref name=\"Shapiro2003p269\">{{Harvcoltxt|Shapiro|2003|p=269}}</ref>) loses its own independent meaning and instead \"lends a certain shade of meaning\"<ref>{{Harvcoltxt|Snell|Weightman|1989|p=154}}</ref> to the main or stem verb, which \"comprises the lexical core of the compound\".<ref name=\"Shapiro2003p269\"/> While almost any verb can act as a main verb, there is a limited set of productive auxiliaries.<ref>{{Harvcoltxt|Shapiro|2003|pp=269\u2013270}}</ref> Shown below are prominent such auxiliaries, with their independent meaning first outlined, followed by their semantic contribution as auxiliaries.\n\n*''j\u0101n\u0101'' \"to go\"; gives a sense of completeness, finality, or change of state. e.g. ''\u0101n\u0101'' \"to come\" \u2192 ''\u0101 j\u0101n\u0101'' \"to come, arrive\"; ''kh\u0101n\u0101'' \"to eat\" \u2192 ''kh\u0101 j\u0101n\u0101'' \"to eat up\"; ''p\u012bn\u0101'' \"to drink\" \u2192 ''p\u012b j\u0101n\u0101'' \"to drink up\"; ''{{IAST|bai\u1e6dhn\u0101}}'' \"to sit\" \u2192 ''{{IAST|bai\u1e6dh j\u0101n\u0101}}'' \"to sit down\"; ''samajhn\u0101'' \"to understand\" \u2192 ''samajh j\u0101n\u0101'' \"to realise\"; ''son\u0101'' \"to sleep\" \u2192 ''so j\u0101n\u0101'' \"to go to sleep\"; ''hon\u0101'' \"to be\" \u2192 ''ho j\u0101n\u0101'' \"to become, happen\".<ref>{{Harvcoltxt|Snell|Weightman|1989|pp=155}}</ref>\n*''len\u0101'' \"to take\"; suggests that the benefit of the action flows towards the doer. e.g. ''{{IAST|pa\u1e5bh len\u0101}}'' \"to read (to/for oneself)\".<ref name=\"Snell&Weightman1989p156\">{{Harvcoltxt|Snell|Weightman|1989|pp=156}}</ref>\n*''den\u0101'' \"to give\"; suggests that the benefit of the action flows away from the doer. e.g. ''{{IAST|pa\u1e5bh den\u0101}}'' \"to read (out)\".<ref name=\"Snell&Weightman1989p156\"/>\n\nThe above three are the most common of auxiliaries, and the \"least marked\", or \"lexically nearly colourless\".<ref name=\"Schmidt2003p337\">{{Harvcoltxt|Schmidt|2003|pp=337}}</ref> The nuance conveyed by an auxiliary can often be very subtle, and need not always be expressed with different words in English translation.

It is formed from the perfective participle by addition of the auxiliary ''j\u0101n\u0101'' \"to go\"; i.e. ''likhn\u0101'' \"to write\" \u2192 ''likh\u0101 j\u0101n\u0101'' \"to be written\". The agent is marked by the postposition ''se''. Furthermore, both intransitive and transitive verbs may be grammatically passivized to show physical/psychological incapacity, usually in negative sentences. Lastly, intransitives often have a passive sense, or convey unintentional action.<ref>{{Harvcoltxt|Schmidt|2003|p=331}}</ref>\n\n==Syntax==\nHindustani is an [[subject\u2013object\u2013verb|SOV]] language. It is neither purely left- or right-[[Branching (linguistics)|branching]], and phenomena of both types can be found. The order of constituents in sentences as a whole lacks governing \"hard and fast rules\", and frequent deviations can be found from normative word position, describable in terms of a small number of rules, accounting for facts beyond the pale of the label of \"SOV\".<ref>{{Harvcoltxt|Shapiro|2003|p=271}}</ref>\n\n# Indirect objects precede direct objects.\n# Attributive adjectives precede the noun they qualify.\n# Adverbs precede the adjectives they qualify.\n# Negative markers (''nah\u012b\u0303, na, mat'') and interrogatives precede the verb.\n# Interrogatives precede negative markers if both are present.\n# ''ky\u0101'' (\"what?\") as the [[yes-no question]] marker occurs at the ''beginning'' of a clause.\n\n===Possession===\nPossession, reflecting what many other languages indicate via the verb ''to have'', is reflected in Hindustani by the genitive ''k\u0101'' (inflected appropriately) or the postposition ''ke p\u0101s'' (\"near\") and the verb ''hon\u0101''. Possible objects of possession (nouns) fall into two main categories in Hindustani: one for persons such as family members, or body parts, and the other for most inanimate objects, animals, most abstract ideas, and some persons such as servants.\n\n* For indicating possession with objects of the first category, ''k\u0101'' appears after the subject of the possession, followed by the object. With personal pronouns, this requires the use of the possessive pronoun (inflected appropriately). Examples: ''Mer\u012b m\u0101t\u0101 hai'' (\"I have a mother\"), ''\u015aiv k\u012b t\u012bn \u0101\u0303kh\u1ebd ha\u0129'' (\"Shiva has three eyes\").\n* For indicating possession with objects of the second category, the compound postposition ''ke p\u0101s'' (\"near\") is used. For example: ''Mohan ke p\u0101s ek bakr\u012b hai'' (\"Mohan has a goat\", but also \"There is a goat near Mohan\").\n\n===Relativization===\nRather than using relative clauses after nouns, as in English, Hindustani uses correlative clauses. A correlative clause goes before the entire clause, rather than being imbeded in the clause next to the noun it relativizes. For example, the following sentence means, \"The girl who is standing is is tall.\"<ref>https://ojs.ub.uni-konstanz.de/jsal/index.php/fasal/article/view/109/67</ref>\n\nJo la\u1e5bk\u012b kha\u1e5b\u012b hai, vo lamb\u012b hai.\n\nwhich girl.F.SG standing.F.SG be.PRS.3.SG., that tall.F.SG be.PRS.SG.\n\nModern Hindi also uses post-noun relative clauses which are similar to English. This may be the result of English influence on the language.<ref>https://brill.com/view/journals/jlc/4/2/article-p250_4.xml</ref>\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|3}}\n\n==Bibliography==\n*{{Citation\n |last=Masica\n |first=Colin\n |authorlink=Colin Masica\n |year=1991\n |title=The Indo-Aryan Languages\n|place= Cambridge\n |publisher=Cambridge University Press\n |isbn=978-0-521-29944-2\n |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=J3RSHWePhXwC&printsec=frontcover&dq=indo-aryan+languages\n}}.\n*{{Citation\n |last=Schmidt\n |first=Ruth Laila\n |year=2003\n |chapter=Urdu\n |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=jPR2OlbTbdkC&pg=PA286&dq=indo-aryan&sig=BWUDFSCrQPgfbEznzUZcq7B2HnE\n|editor1-last= Cardona\n|editor1-first= George\n|editor2-last= Jain\n|editor2-first= Dhanesh\n |title=The Indo-Aryan Languages\n |publisher=Routledge\n |isbn=978-0-415-77294-5\n |pages=286\u2013350\n}}.\n*{{Citation\n |last=McGregor\n |first=Ronald Stuart\n |year=1995\n |title=Outline of Hindi Grammar\n |publisher=Clarendon Press\n|place=Oxford\n |edition=third\n |isbn=0-19-870008-3\n}}.\n*{{Citation\n |last=Shapiro\n |first=Michael C.\n |year=2003\n |chapter=Hindi\n |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=jPR2OlbTbdkC&pg=PA250&dq=indo-aryan&sig=cUNurxJKkTLfKf8uiMd7pWX2RC0\n|editor1-last= Cardona\n|editor1-first= George\n|editor2-last= Jain\n|editor2-first= Dhanesh\n |title=The Indo-Aryan Languages\n |publisher=Routledge\n |isbn=978-0-415-77294-5\n |pages=250\u2013285\n}}.\n*{{Citation\n|last1= Snell\n|first1= Rupert\n|last2= Weightman\n|first2= Simon\n |year=1989\n |title=[[Teach Yourself]] Hindi\n |publisher=McGraw-Hill\n |edition=2003\n |isbn=978-0-07-142012-9\n}}.\n\n==Further reading==\n*{{citebook|url=https://archive.org/stream/introductiontohi00shakrich#page/8/mode/2up|title=An introduction to the Hindustani language comprising a grammar, and a vocabulary, English and Hindustani : also short stories and dialogues, short stories in Persian and Nagari characters ... and military words of command, Nagari and English|author=Shakespear, John, (1775-1858).|publisher=London : W.H.
