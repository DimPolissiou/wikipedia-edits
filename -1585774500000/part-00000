''Thakur'' of the village (Lalit Parimoo) had bad intentions towards ''Kajri'' so he asked his special man ''Bhoja'' (Sanjay Mishra) to get ''Kajri'' for him but ''Kajri'' was very loyal towards her husband and one day she attacked ''Thakur'' in her defence. Rather than praising her, ''Kishnu'' warns ''Kajri'' to not to behave like this with Thakur ever again and this was the heartbreak for ''Kajri'' as she never imagined a husband who will leave her alone to fight with the world. Sad ''Kajri'' was trying to convince herself that if her husband will see him with any other man he will definitely react. Here ''Bhoja'' fell in love with ''Kajri'' and this gave her idea to test her husband by using ''Bhoja'' to see her husband's reaction.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://navbharattimes.indiatimes.com/video/entertainment/movie-kanchali-starcast-interview/videoshow/73769680.cms|title=\u091c\u092c '\u0915\u093e\u0902\u091a\u0932\u0940' \u0915\u0940 \u0938\u094d\u200d\u091f\u093e\u0930\u0915\u093e\u0938\u094d\u200d\u091f \u0915\u0947 \u0938\u093e\u0925 \u0939\u0941\u0908 \u092c\u0949\u0932\u093f\u0935\u0941\u0921 \u0917\u092a\u0936\u092a|website=navbharattimes.indiatimes.com|language=hi|access-date=2020-03-21}}</ref>\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Sanjay Mishra (actor)|Sanjay Mishra]]<ref>{{cite web|url=https://bollyy.com/sanjay-mishra-unveiled-the-poster-of-kaanchli-life-in-a-slough/|title=Sanjay Mishra Unveiled The Poster Of Kaanchli- Life In A Slough}}</ref> as Bhoja\n* [[Shikha Malhotra]]<ref>{{cite web|url=https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/shikha-malhotra|title=SHIKHA MALHOTRA Actress}}</ref> as Kajri\n* [[Lalit Parimoo]]<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/name/nm1391032/|title=Lalit Parimoo IMDB}}</ref> as Thakur\n* Nareshpal Singh Chouhan<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gYu22-pned8|title=\u092c\u093e\u0902\u0938\u0935\u093e\u0921\u093c\u093e \u0928\u093f\u0935\u093e\u0938\u0940 \u0928\u0930\u0947\u0936 \u092a\u093e\u0932 \u0928\u0947 \u0915\u093f\u092f\u093e \u092c\u0949\u0932\u0940\u0935\u0941\u0921 \u092b\u093f\u0932\u094d\u092e \u092e\u0947\u0902 \u0932\u0940\u0921 \u0930\u094b\u0932,7 \u092b\u0930\u0935\u0930\u0940 \u0915\u094b \u0932\u0949\u0928\u094d\u091a \u0939\u094b\u0917\u0940 \u092b\u093f\u0932\u094d\u092e \u0915\u093e\u091a\u0932\u0940}}</ref> as Kishnu\n\n== Production ==\n\n=== Development ===\nThe official announcement of the film was made in June 2018. ''Dedipya Joshii'' had been working on the script of the film from year 2008. The director says that after reading this story \"Kenchuli\" written by [[Vijaydan Detha]] he decided to make a film on it and started writing the first draft of it. After getting satisfied by completing the fourth draft soon he wrote a letter to ''Vijaydan Detha'' and also attached this draft. Surprisingly ''Vijaydan Detha'' called the director ''Dedipya Joshii'' and invited him to his house located in ''Borunda'', [[Jodhpur]]. ''Dedipya Joshii'' shared that he stayed for few days with ''Vijaydan Detha'' and after knowing him personally he happily gave him the rights of his story '\"Kenchuli\"' with a compliment saying that after reading the script and talking over the phone with ''Dedipya Joshii'' he assumed him an old age and very experienced person and after meeting him he got really shocked seeing this young gentleman standing in front of him full of enthusiasm. As soon as ''Dedipya Joshii'' returned to Mumbai, he started working to execute this story in a feature film. After few days ''Vijaydan Detha'' written a very affectionate and hopeful letter to ''Dedipya Joshii'' saying;\n\n{{cquote|Dear ''Dedipya'', I Have decided to give you the rights to make this story which is very close to my heart after seeing the transparency within your soul through which you perceive things and execute them in your film making as well as in real life with your immense honesty and I hope that the transparency of your soul could reach to the people when you will present \"Kenchuli\" on the silver screen, Best wishes... \n---''Vijaydan Detha'' to ''Dedipya Joshii'' Director of Film ''Kaanchli Life in a Slough''}}\n\n=== Casting ===\nThe Director ''Dedipya Joshii'' first cast ''Shikha Malhotra'' as ''Kajri'' and then approached the in-demand star [[Sanjay Mishra (actor)|Sanjay Mishra]] as ''Bhoja'' and he said yes to the film, later he finalised ''Narespal Singh Chouhan'' as ''Kishnu'' and [[Lalit Parimoo]] as ''Thakur'' in the film.\n\n=== Filming ===\nThe principal photography of the film commenced sometime in the November 2018 but during that time [[Sanjay Mishra (actor)|Sanjay Mishra]] had to travel [[Busan International Film Festival]] for his forth coming film [[Kaamyaab]] and the shooting schedule of \"Kaanchli- Life in a Slough\" got postponed for a month.

''Thakur'' of the village (Lalit Parimoo) had bad intentions towards ''Kajri'' so he asked his special man ''Bhoja'' (Sanjay Mishra) to get ''Kajri'' for him but ''Kajri'' was very loyal towards her husband and one day she attacked ''Thakur'' in her defence. Rather than praising her, ''Kishnu'' warns ''Kajri'' to not to behave like this with Thakur ever again and this was the heartbreak for ''Kajri'' as she never imagined a husband who will leave her alone to fight with the world. Sad ''Kajri'' was trying to convince herself that if her husband will see him with any other man he will definitely react. Here ''Bhoja'' fell in love with ''Kajri'' and this gave her idea to test her husband by using ''Bhoja'' to see her husband's reaction.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://navbharattimes.indiatimes.com/video/entertainment/movie-kanchali-starcast-interview/videoshow/73769680.cms|title=\u091c\u092c '\u0915\u093e\u0902\u091a\u0932\u0940' \u0915\u0940 \u0938\u094d\u200d\u091f\u093e\u0930\u0915\u093e\u0938\u094d\u200d\u091f \u0915\u0947 \u0938\u093e\u0925 \u0939\u0941\u0908 \u092c\u0949\u0932\u093f\u0935\u0941\u0921 \u0917\u092a\u0936\u092a|website=navbharattimes.indiatimes.com|language=hi|access-date=2020-03-21}}</ref>\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Sanjay Mishra (actor)|Sanjay Mishra]]<ref>{{cite web|url=https://bollyy.com/sanjay-mishra-unveiled-the-poster-of-kaanchli-life-in-a-slough/|title=Sanjay Mishra Unveiled The Poster Of Kaanchli- Life In A Slough}}</ref> as Bhoja\n* [[Shikha Malhotra]]<ref>{{cite web|url=https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/shikha-malhotra|title=SHIKHA MALHOTRA Actress}}</ref> as Kajri\n* [[Lalit Parimoo]]<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/name/nm1391032/|title=Lalit Parimoo IMDB}}</ref> as Thakur\n* Nareshpal Singh Chouhan<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gYu22-pned8|title=\u092c\u093e\u0902\u0938\u0935\u093e\u0921\u093c\u093e \u0928\u093f\u0935\u093e\u0938\u0940 \u0928\u0930\u0947\u0936 \u092a\u093e\u0932 \u0928\u0947 \u0915\u093f\u092f\u093e \u092c\u0949\u0932\u0940\u0935\u0941\u0921 \u092b\u093f\u0932\u094d\u092e \u092e\u0947\u0902 \u0932\u0940\u0921 \u0930\u094b\u0932,7 \u092b\u0930\u0935\u0930\u0940 \u0915\u094b \u0932\u0949\u0928\u094d\u091a \u0939\u094b\u0917\u0940 \u092b\u093f\u0932\u094d\u092e \u0915\u093e\u091a\u0932\u0940}}</ref> as Kishnu\n\n== Production ==\n\n=== Development ===\nThe official announcement of the film was made in June 2018. ''Dedipya Joshii'' had been working on the script of the film from year 2008. The director says that after reading this story \"Kenchuli\" written by [[Vijaydan Detha]] he decided to make a film on it and started writing the first draft of it. After getting satisfied by completing the fourth draft soon he wrote a letter to ''Vijaydan Detha'' and also attached this draft. Surprisingly ''Vijaydan Detha'' called the director ''Dedipya Joshii'' and invited him to his house located in ''Borunda'', [[Jodhpur]]. ''Dedipya Joshii'' shared that he stayed for few days with ''Vijaydan Detha'' and after knowing him personally he happily gave him the rights of his story '\"Kenchuli\"' with a compliment saying that after reading the script and talking over the phone with ''Dedipya Joshii'' he assumed him an old age and very experienced person and after meeting him he got really shocked seeing this young gentleman standing in front of him full of enthusiasm. As soon as ''Dedipya Joshii'' returned to Mumbai, he started working to execute this story in a feature film. After few days ''Vijaydan Detha'' written a very affectionate and hopeful letter to ''Dedipya Joshii'' saying;\n\n{{cquote|Dear ''Dedipya'', I Have decided to give you the rights to make this story which is very close to my heart after seeing the transparency within your soul through which you perceive things and execute them in your film making as well as in real life with your immense honesty and I hope that the transparency of your soul could reach to the people when you will present \"Kenchuli\" on the silver screen, Best wishes... \n---''Vijaydan Detha'' to ''Dedipya Joshii'' Director of Film ''Kaanchli Life in a Slough''}}\n\n=== Casting ===\nThe Director ''Dedipya Joshii'' first cast ''Shikha Malhotra'' as ''Kajri'' and then approached the in-demand star [[Sanjay Mishra (actor)|Sanjay Mishra]] as ''Bhoja'' and he said yes to the film, later he finalised ''Narespal Singh Chouhan'' as ''Kishnu'' and [[Lalit Parimoo]] as ''Thakur'' in the film.\n\n=== Filming ===\nThe principal photography of the film commenced sometime in the November 2018 but during that time [[Sanjay Mishra (actor)|Sanjay Mishra]] had to travel [[Busan International Film Festival]] for his forth coming film [[Kaamyaab]] and the shooting schedule of \"Kaanchli- Life in a Slough\" got postponed for a month.

The site was selected to protect the bridge, to have a base of operations in central Kentucky, and to prepare to secure the [[Cumberland Gap]] and eastern Tennessee. The camp was also used as a site to train new soldiers for the Union army. The Kentucky River and Hickman Creek steep [[palisade]]s contributed to the selection of the site. Only the northern side needed fortifications against [[Confederate States Army|Confederate]] attack since three sides have 400\u2013500 feet almost vertical steep cliffs .<ref>Sears pp. 21&ndash;23.</ref>\n\nCamp Nelson may have been the choice for a central Kentucky depot, but it had disadvantages. When Union Major General [[Ambrose Burnside]] attacked the Cumberland Gap and [[Knoxville, Tennessee]], Camp Nelson's distance from the Gap and Knoxville, combined with lack of railroads and the weather, hampered the Union advance.<ref>Sears p. 28.</ref>\n\nIts drawbacks as a well situated supply depot led General [[William Tecumseh Sherman]] to prioritize Camp Nelson to take a major role in training 10,000 black soldiers who volunteered there for the U.S. Colored Troops. He advocated this role in response to overall Union commander [[Ulysses S. Grant]] who visited Camp Nelson in January 1864. Grant had observed the inadequacies in the overland supply routes employed and leaned toward abandoning it entirely.<ref name=\":7\">Sears lxii</ref> Despite Grant's misgivings, Camp Nelson continued supplying major battles in 1864 such as Saltville VA I and Saltville VA II, as well as Atlanta for which the site provided 10,000 horses.\n\nRecognizing that the Camp Nelson supply depot and the nearby Hickman Bridge were valuable targets for Confederate raider General [[John Hunt Morgan]], Union forces geared up for attacks in July 1863 and June 1864. The most serious threat was mid-June 1864 when Brig. General [[Speed S. Fry]] called upon volunteers from among civilian employees. Six hundred were armed and performed guard duty at the northern fortifications around the clock for 6 days. Major C. E. Compton said that due to these civilians, \u201cthe depot was saved from capture and destruction.\u201d<ref name=\":7\" />\n\n=== Black History: troops, impressed workers, refugees, and emancipation ===\nKentucky was one of four slaveholding states which did not join the 11 other slaveholding southern states in forming the   [[Confederate States of America]] which was in a rebellion rooted in decades of disputes over slavery. Kentucky blacks, enslaved and not, men and women, majorly contributed to the Union war effort in Kentucky initially as laborers, but ultimately as soldiers in infantry, artillery, and cavalry.<ref name=\":4\" />\n\nBecause Kentucky was a slaveholding state, but not one in rebellion, those escaping could not be included as [[Contraband (American Civil War)|contrabands]] as defined by the [[Confiscation Act of 1861]]. This law applied to the Confederacy only and declared that if enslaved people are considered property, then the military has the right to not only deny the access to the owner but also to impress these individuals into work.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.nps.gov./articles/fort-monroe-and-the-contrabands-of-war.htm|title=Fort Monroe and the \"Contrabands of War\"|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref> Nonetheless, the Union Army in the state began impressing thousands, initially only of the disloyal or those who had already fled into Union camps. In the case of disloyal or unknown slave holders, wages and subsistence were paid to the enslaved person. Loyal slaveholders were compensated.<ref name=\":10\">{{Cite book|title=A history of Blacks in Kentucky|last=Lucas, Marion Brunson, 1935-|date=1992|publisher=Kentucky Historical Society|others=Wright, George C.|isbn=0916968235|location=[Frankfort]|pages=150|oclc=26161170}}</ref>\n\nSpecific to Camp Nelson August 1863, Brig.

An example is agent George Denny who impressed Gabriel Burdett from nearby farm of Hiram Burdett who was compensated $30 per month. Some like Burdett would eventually enlist by 1864 in the U.S. Colored Troops. <ref name=\":13\" />\n\nConsequentially, an estimated 3,000 impressed workers were stationed at Camp Nelson in 1863 performing labor-intensive tasks critical to the camp's founding and defense. Starting with fortifying the strategic Hickman Bridge in May, 1863, they aided in the construction of railroads, the northern fortifications and forts, and the 300 buildings.<ref name=\"KLEBER\" /><ref name=\":6\">{{Cite web|url=https://exploreuk.uky.edu/fa/findingaid/?id=xt77sq8qcb8z#top|title=Camp Nelson photographic collection|website=exploreuk.uky.edu|access-date=2019-06-04}}</ref>\n\nPresident Lincoln's [[Emancipation Proclamation]] of January 1, 1863 freed the enslaved only in the rebellious 11 states in the [[Confederate States of America|Confederacy]]. The War Department then publicly authorized the recruitment and training of African Americans in these states.

Unlike the soldiers, the refugees were initially not eligible for emancipation. The army did not have a clear policy for refugees, but they were allowed to establish a shanty village at Camp Nelson.\n\nHowever, on November 22\u201325, 1864, District Commander [[Speed S. Fry]], native of Danville, KY, under pressure from slave-owners, reversed this practice.<ref name=\":0\" /> He ordered soldiers to force out under threat of death 400 women and children onto wagons and escort them out of the camp.

The refugees suffered 102 deaths due to exposure and disease.<ref name=\"KLEBER\" /><ref name=\":0\" />\n\nCamp Nelson Chief Quartermaster Theron E. Hall and Reverend [[John Gregg Fee]] of the [[American Missionary Association]] led a public outcry to newspapers, high ranking Washington officials, and the northern public.  Hall gathered testimony from USCT soldiers on the battered conditions of their families and submitted them to Brig. General [[Stephen G. Burbridge]], commander of the District of Kentucky. Burbridge ordered Fry to immediately cease expulsions, allow the families to return, and provide quarters. Secretary of War [[Edwin Stanton]], Lincoln\u2019s Secretary of War, followed up with an order that a permanent shelter be established for <u>''all''</u> refugees, regardless of any family ties to USCT troops.<ref name=\":13\" />\n\n''The [[New York Tribune]]'' published a front page account on Nov. 28, 1864 entitled Cruel Treatment of the Wives and Children of U.S. Colored Soldiers. \u201cAt this moment, over ''four hundred'' helpless human beings....having been driven from their homes by United States soldiers, are now lying in barns and mule sheds, wandering through the woods....literally starving, for no other crime than their husbands and fathers having thrown aside the manacles of Slavery to shoulder Union muskets.\u201d<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nBy December 1864, the military reversed its policies, and authorized the construction of the Home for Colored Refugees.

The site was selected to protect the bridge, to have a base of operations in central Kentucky, and to prepare to secure the [[Cumberland Gap]] and eastern Tennessee. The camp was also used as a site to train new soldiers for the Union army. The Kentucky River and Hickman Creek steep [[palisade]]s contributed to the selection of the site. Only the northern side needed fortifications against [[Confederate States Army|Confederate]] attack since three sides have 400\u2013500 feet almost vertical steep cliffs .<ref>Sears pp. 21&ndash;23.</ref>\n\nCamp Nelson may have been the choice for a central Kentucky depot, but it had disadvantages. When Union Major General [[Ambrose Burnside]] attacked the Cumberland Gap and [[Knoxville, Tennessee]], Camp Nelson's distance from the Gap and Knoxville, combined with lack of railroads and the weather, hampered the Union advance.<ref>Sears p. 28.</ref>\n\nIts drawbacks as a well situated supply depot led General [[William Tecumseh Sherman]] to prioritize Camp Nelson to take a major role in training 10,000 black soldiers who volunteered there for the U.S. Colored Troops. He advocated this role in response to overall Union commander [[Ulysses S. Grant]] who visited Camp Nelson in January 1864. Grant had observed the inadequacies in the overland supply routes employed and leaned toward abandoning it entirely.<ref name=\":7\">Sears lxii</ref> Despite Grant's misgivings, Camp Nelson continued supplying major battles in 1864 such as Saltville VA I and Saltville VA II, as well as Atlanta for which the site provided 10,000 horses.\n\nRecognizing that the Camp Nelson supply depot and the nearby Hickman Bridge were valuable targets for Confederate raider General [[John Hunt Morgan]], Union forces geared up for attacks in July 1863 and June 1864. The most serious threat was mid-June 1864 when Brig. General [[Speed S. Fry]] called upon volunteers from among civilian employees. Six hundred were armed and performed guard duty at the northern fortifications around the clock for 6 days. Major C. E. Compton said that due to these civilians, \u201cthe depot was saved from capture and destruction.\u201d<ref name=\":7\" />\n\n=== Black History: troops, impressed workers, refugees, and emancipation ===\nKentucky was one of four slaveholding states which did not join the 11 other slaveholding southern states in forming the   [[Confederate States of America]] which was in a rebellion rooted in decades of disputes over slavery. Kentucky blacks, enslaved and not, men and women, majorly contributed to the Union war effort in Kentucky initially as laborers, but ultimately as soldiers in infantry, artillery, and cavalry.<ref name=\":4\" />\n\nBecause Kentucky was a slaveholding state, but not one in rebellion, those escaping could not be included as [[Contraband (American Civil War)|contrabands]] as defined by the [[Confiscation Act of 1861]].

General [[Jeremiah Boyle]], authorized Commander Speed S. Fry to impress enslaved male, ages 16\u201345 within 14 counties of Central Kentucky, up to one-third of the owner's workforce.

Burbridge ordered Fry to immediately cease expulsions, allow the families to return, and provide quarters.

General [[George Stoneman]] and Burbridge engaged General [[John C. Breckinridge]], a Kentuckian and former Vice President, in nearby Marion, VA, outnumbering their opponents by four to one. Breckinridge retreated after two days. Union troops destroyed the saltworks, and considerably damaged neighboring lead mines and railroads. The USCC troops continued to add to their hard-won reputation.<ref name=\":5\" />\n\nThe USCC 5th were again subjected to a murderous assault like that of Saltville I in January 1865 in Simpsonville, KY. Assigned to herd about 1,000 cattle from Camp Nelson to Louisville, KY, 80 soldiers of Company E 5th USCC were ambushed by Confederate guerrillas led by Capt. Dick Taylor. First attacked were the 41 soldiers bringing up the rear, most of whom could not fire due to fouled powder. Locals found 15 dead and 20 wounded and reported Taylor's men boasting about murdering 19 Union soldiers. Lt. Colonel [[Louis H. Carpenter]] of the 5th documented the names of the guerrillas and urged a prosecution. This never happened.
