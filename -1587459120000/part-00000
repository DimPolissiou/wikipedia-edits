Afterward, he moved to New York City, where he set up his famous studio on Lafayette Street, traveling frequently to Los Angeles and Europe to shoot fashion, advertising, and portraiture for major publications such as Vanity Fair and Harper's Bazaar. His fine-art nudes have been exhibited in galleries and museums around the world. His shows have included \u201cOriginal Sin\u201d and \u201cThree Boys from Pasadena \u2013 A Tribute to Helmut Newton\u201d with fellow Art Center alumni Just Loomis and Mark Arbeit. Holz has collected a variety of prestigious industry awards over the years including a Grammy and a Clio.\n\nHolz works as an adjunct professor and lectures internationally at museums and universities, mentoring young photographers and passing on his photographic aspirations to \u201calways begin and end with light, \u201d to \u201cdo it all in-camera,\u201d and to \u201cbring modern photography back to the level of the artful burn and dodge of the past.\u201d\n\nHolz continues to travel extensively for his commercial work, fine-art shows, and lectures, and is currently working on several projects, including his upcoming book of nudes.  When not exploring remote locations and photographing his muses, George's favorite pastimes include traveling the American backroads in his '58 Airstream and conversing with his chocolate lab, Ruby.\n\n== Career ==\n\n===Early Work===\nA native of [[Oak Ridge, Tennessee]], Holz received his first camera as a gift at age 15, a [[Minolta SR-T 101]]. With this camera, he took a photo of country star [[Lynn Anderson]], which was published in [[People Magazine]] when Holz was still a teenager. After graduating from high school, Holz traveled to Europe and Israel, practicing travel and documentary photography.  Holz was educated at the [[Art Center College of Design]] in [[Pasadena, California]]. While there, he apprenticed with [[Helmut Newton]]. Newton encouraged Holz to go to Europe and Holz spent several years at the beginning of his career in [[Milan]], where his fashion editorials appeared in European publications such as [[Vogue Italia]], [[Madame Figaro]], and French [[Elle (magazine)|Elle]]. He then returned to Los Angeles and focused on shooting album covers, including [[Madonna (entertainer)|Madonna]]'s [[Borderline (Madonna song)|Borderline]].\n\nAfter his success in Europe, Holz moved to New York in the mid-1980s, where he opened a studio in [[Greenwich Village]]. He continued to shoot fashion editorial for ''[[Harper's Bazaar]]'', ''[[Interview Magazine]]'' and the ''[[New York Times]]'', and began celebrity portraiture as well, publishing his images in ''[[InStyle]]'', ''[[People (magazine)|People]]'', ''[[Glamour (magazine)|Glamour]]'', ''[[Rolling Stone]]'', ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]'', ''[[GQ]]'', and ''[[Vanity Fair (magazine)|Vanity Fair]]''. Notably, Holz was one of the first major photographers to shoot [[Angelina Jolie]] at the beginning of her career.\n\n===Current Work===\nHolz has moved between editorial and advertising work for the past two decades. He created numerous advertising campaigns, including ones for [[Elizabeth Arden]], [[Bloomingdales]], [[DeBeers]] and [[Max Factor]], and won a [[Clio Award]] for his campaign for the International Gold Corporation. Holz continued to lens the artwork for a number of albums, including those of [[Shania Twain]], [[Lindsay Lohan]], [[Mariah Carey]], [[Van Halen]], [[Joan Jett]], [[Boyz II Men]], and [[Chaka Kahn]]. In 1990, he won a [[Grammy]] for his artwork on [[Suzanne Vega]]'s album ''[[Days of Open Hand]]''.\n\nHolz also began shooting movie posters, including those for ''[[Face/Off]]'', ''[[The General's Daughter (film)|The General's Daughter]]'', ''[[Along Came a Spider (film)|Along Came a Spider]]'', and ''[[Glitter (film)|Glitter]]'' as well as the print campaigns for TV shows ''[[House (TV series)|House]]'', [[Smash (U.S. TV series)|Smash]], ''[[Fringe (TV series)|Fringe]]'', and ''[[Hell's Kitchen (U.S. TV series)|Hell's Kitchen]]''. In 2003, George appeared on ''[[America's Next Top Model]]'', shooting the models underwater in a tank and serving as a judge.\n\n===Books===\nIn 1997, Holz' ''Original Sin'', the exhibition catalogue to his traveling exhibit was published by Domeqc. His collection of celebrity portraits, ''HOLZ HOLLYWOOD: 30 YEARS OF PORTRAITS\" was published by DAAB MEDIA in April, 2015''\n\n==Style==\nHolz calls his style \"painting with light\" and his work betrays a sensuous, nuanced vision. Holz has shot both celebrities and nudes, two groups likely to become inhibited in front of the camera. His extensive work in both areas indicates his facility with making subjects comfortable and his ability to draw out his subjects.\n\nHolz is most known for his black and white nudes, which he has been shooting since 1974 and which have been exhibited widely. Many of the nudes are shot at Holz' farm in Upstate New York, with the subjects posed outside in nature. Holz began a unique project photographing nudes posed with animal bones, tortoiseshells, and antlers, contrasting living flesh with ancient relics. He also photographed nudes with found objects, juxtaposing the natural and the manmade.\n\n==Exhibits==\n\nGeorge Holz has been the subject of international solo shows in [[Budapest, Hungary]] and the [[University of Applied Arts, Vienna]] (Photographs By George Holz, 1990) and part of a group show [[Laforet]] Museum in Tokyo (The Nude in Photography, 1993). His first one-man show was at the Center for Photography at Woodstock in New York.\n\nHolz' art show \"Original Sin\" was exhibited at the Fahey/Klein Gallery in [[Los Angeles]], the Staley Wise Gallery in [[New York City]], the Gallery for Fine Photography in [[New Orleans]], the John Cleary Gallery in [[Houston]] and the Robert Klein Gallery in [[Boston]], in 1997-98. It also traveled to fine art galleries in [[New Orleans]], [[Houston]], and [[San Francisco]].\n\nIn 2009, Holz was the subject, along with [[Just Loomis]] and [[Mark Arbeit]], of the exhibit \"Three Boys from Pasadena: A Tribute to Helmut Newton.\" Conceived and curated by Newton's widow [[June Newton]], the exhibit was devoted to Newton's three longtime assistants and collaborators, and explored Newton's influence on their later work.<ref>Gould-Simon, Alisa and Matthew Schneier. ''Learning from the Master.\" Style.com, December 6, 2010</ref><ref>Lynch, Maura. \"Three Artists Pay A Personal Tribute to Helmut Newton.\" W Magazine Online, October 29, 2010</ref> The show premiered at the Helmut Newton Foundation in [[Berlin]], and was exhibited in [[Paris]] and [[New York City|New York]]. In April 2012, the exhibit will be part of Art Cologne, and in June 2012, it will make its West Coast debut at the Williamson Gallery of the [[Art Center College of Design]] in [[Pasadena, California|Pasadena]]. An accompanying book, \"Three Boys from Pasadena,\" with an introduction by June Newton, was published in 2010. The book featured a mix of personal work by Loomis, Arbeit and Holz, with memorabilia of their time as Newton's assistants, including contact sheets, letters, snapshots, and journal pages.\n\nHolz' work is in the permanent collection of the [[International Museum of Photography and Film]] at the [[George Eastman House]] in [[Rochester, New York]], and the Centro Cultural/Arte Contemporaneo in [[Mexico City]].\n\n==Selected Exhibitions==\n\n*''The Art of Persuasion: A History of Advertising Photography'', International Museum of Photography at the George Eastman House, Rochester NY, 1988 (permanent collection)\n*''George Holz: Photographs'' The Center for Photography at Woodstock, 1989\n*''Photographs by George Holz'':  ''Hohschule fur Angewandte Hunst'', Vienna, 1990\n*''George Holz'': G.

was born in Oak Ridge, Tennessee (aka \u201cthe Secret City\u201d),<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.georgeholz.com/ABOUT/1|title=About}}</ref> graduated from the Art Center College of Design in Pasadena, California, and assisted for Helmut Newton, whom he credits with guiding his career.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1990/04/29/style/style-makers-george-holz-fashion-photographer.html|title=Style Makers; George Holz, Fashion Photographer|last=|first=|date=|work=|access-date=}}</ref> As a fledgling photographer, he lived in Milan and Paris, where he shot beauty and fashion for major European magazines such as Italian Vogue and French Elle. Afterward, he moved to New York City, where he set up his famous studio on Lafayette Street, traveling frequently to Los Angeles and Europe to shoot fashion, advertising, and portraiture for major publications such as Vanity Fair and Harper's Bazaar. His fine-art nudes have been exhibited in galleries and museums around the world. His shows have included \u201cOriginal Sin\u201d and \u201cThree Boys from Pasadena \u2013 A Tribute to Helmut Newton\u201d with fellow Art Center alumni Just Loomis and Mark Arbeit. Holz has collected a variety of prestigious industry awards over the years including a Grammy and a Clio.\n\nHolz works as an adjunct professor and lectures internationally at museums and universities, mentoring young photographers and passing on his photographic aspirations to \u201calways begin and end with light, \u201d to \u201cdo it all in-camera,\u201d and to \u201cbring modern photography back to the level of the artful burn and dodge of the past.\u201d\n\nHolz continues to travel extensively for his commercial work, fine-art shows, and lectures, and is currently working on several projects, including his upcoming book of nudes.  When not exploring remote locations and photographing his muses, George's favorite pastimes include traveling the American backroads in his '58 Airstream and conversing with his chocolate lab, Ruby.\n\n== Career ==\n\n===Early Work===\nA native of [[Oak Ridge, Tennessee]], Holz received his first camera as a gift at age 15, a [[Minolta SR-T 101]]. With this camera, he took a photo of country star [[Lynn Anderson]], which was published in [[People Magazine]] when Holz was still a teenager. After graduating from high school, Holz traveled to Europe and Israel, practicing travel and documentary photography.  Holz was educated at the [[Art Center College of Design]] in [[Pasadena, California]]. While there, he apprenticed with [[Helmut Newton]]. Newton encouraged Holz to go to Europe and Holz spent several years at the beginning of his career in [[Milan]], where his fashion editorials appeared in European publications such as [[Vogue Italia]], [[Madame Figaro]], and French [[Elle (magazine)|Elle]]. He then returned to Los Angeles and focused on shooting album covers, including [[Madonna (entertainer)|Madonna]]'s [[Borderline (Madonna song)|Borderline]].\n\nAfter his success in Europe, Holz moved to New York in the mid-1980s, where he opened a studio in [[Greenwich Village]]. He continued to shoot fashion editorial for ''[[Harper's Bazaar]]'', ''[[Interview Magazine]]'' and the ''[[New York Times]]'', and began celebrity portraiture as well, publishing his images in ''[[InStyle]]'', ''[[People (magazine)|People]]'', ''[[Glamour (magazine)|Glamour]]'', ''[[Rolling Stone]]'', ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]'', ''[[GQ]]'', and ''[[Vanity Fair (magazine)|Vanity Fair]]''. Notably, Holz was one of the first major photographers to shoot [[Angelina Jolie]] at the beginning of her career.\n\n===Current Work===\nHolz has moved between editorial and advertising work for the past two decades. He created numerous advertising campaigns, including ones for [[Elizabeth Arden]], [[Bloomingdales]], [[DeBeers]] and [[Max Factor]], and won a [[Clio Award]] for his campaign for the International Gold Corporation. Holz continued to lens the artwork for a number of albums, including those of [[Shania Twain]], [[Lindsay Lohan]], [[Mariah Carey]], [[Van Halen]], [[Joan Jett]], [[Boyz II Men]], and [[Chaka Kahn]]. In 1990, he won a [[Grammy]] for his artwork on [[Suzanne Vega]]'s album ''[[Days of Open Hand]]''.\n\nHolz also began shooting movie posters, including those for ''[[Face/Off]]'', ''[[The General's Daughter (film)|The General's Daughter]]'', ''[[Along Came a Spider (film)|Along Came a Spider]]'', and ''[[Glitter (film)|Glitter]]'' as well as the print campaigns for TV shows ''[[House (TV series)|House]]'', [[Smash (U.S. TV series)|Smash]], ''[[Fringe (TV series)|Fringe]]'', and ''[[Hell's Kitchen (U.S. TV series)|Hell's Kitchen]]''. In 2003, George appeared on ''[[America's Next Top Model]]'', shooting the models underwater in a tank and serving as a judge.\n\n===Books===\nIn 1997, Holz' ''Original Sin'', the exhibition catalogue to his traveling exhibit was published by Domeqc. His collection of celebrity portraits, ''HOLZ HOLLYWOOD: 30 YEARS OF PORTRAITS\" was published by DAAB MEDIA in April, 2015''\n\n==Style==\nHolz calls his style \"painting with light\" and his work betrays a sensuous, nuanced vision. Holz has shot both celebrities and nudes, two groups likely to become inhibited in front of the camera. His extensive work in both areas indicates his facility with making subjects comfortable and his ability to draw out his subjects.\n\nHolz is most known for his black and white nudes, which he has been shooting since 1974 and which have been exhibited widely. Many of the nudes are shot at Holz' farm in Upstate New York, with the subjects posed outside in nature. Holz began a unique project photographing nudes posed with animal bones, tortoiseshells, and antlers, contrasting living flesh with ancient relics. He also photographed nudes with found objects, juxtaposing the natural and the manmade.\n\n==Exhibits==\n\nGeorge Holz has been the subject of international solo shows in [[Budapest, Hungary]] and the [[University of Applied Arts, Vienna]] (Photographs By George Holz, 1990) and part of a group show [[Laforet]] Museum in Tokyo (The Nude in Photography, 1993). His first one-man show was at the Center for Photography at Woodstock in New York.\n\nHolz' art show \"Original Sin\" was exhibited at the Fahey/Klein Gallery in [[Los Angeles]], the Staley Wise Gallery in [[New York City]], the Gallery for Fine Photography in [[New Orleans]], the John Cleary Gallery in [[Houston]] and the Robert Klein Gallery in [[Boston]], in 1997-98. It also traveled to fine art galleries in [[New Orleans]], [[Houston]], and [[San Francisco]].\n\nIn 2009, Holz was the subject, along with [[Just Loomis]] and [[Mark Arbeit]], of the exhibit \"Three Boys from Pasadena: A Tribute to Helmut Newton.\" Conceived and curated by Newton's widow [[June Newton]], the exhibit was devoted to Newton's three longtime assistants and collaborators, and explored Newton's influence on their later work.<ref>Gould-Simon, Alisa and Matthew Schneier. ''Learning from the Master.\" Style.com, December 6, 2010</ref><ref>Lynch, Maura. \"Three Artists Pay A Personal Tribute to Helmut Newton.\" W Magazine Online, October 29, 2010</ref> The show premiered at the Helmut Newton Foundation in [[Berlin]], and was exhibited in [[Paris]] and [[New York City|New York]]. In April 2012, the exhibit will be part of Art Cologne, and in June 2012, it will make its West Coast debut at the Williamson Gallery of the [[Art Center College of Design]] in [[Pasadena, California|Pasadena]]. An accompanying book, \"Three Boys from Pasadena,\" with an introduction by June Newton, was published in 2010. The book featured a mix of personal work by Loomis, Arbeit and Holz, with memorabilia of their time as Newton's assistants, including contact sheets, letters, snapshots, and journal pages.\n\nHolz' work is in the permanent collection of the [[International Museum of Photography and Film]] at the [[George Eastman House]] in [[Rochester, New York]], and the Centro Cultural/Arte Contemporaneo in [[Mexico City]].\n\n==Selected Exhibitions==\n\n*''The Art of Persuasion: A History of Advertising Photography'', International Museum of Photography at the George Eastman House, Rochester NY, 1988 (permanent collection)\n*''George Holz: Photographs'' The Center for Photography at Woodstock, 1989\n*''Photographs by George Holz'':  ''Hohschule fur Angewandte Hunst'', Vienna, 1990\n*''George Holz'': G.

It was added to the [[New South Wales State Heritage Register]] on 2 April 1999.<ref name=nswshr-127>{{cite NSW SHR|5045370|Old Marulan Town|hr=00127|fn=S90/07432 & HC 30082; 10/24736|accessdate=1 June 2018}}</ref>\n\n== History ==\nThe establishment of towns outside of the [[County of Cumberland, New South Wales|County of Cumberland]] did not gain momentum until the 1830s. This decade became an intensive period of town founding in New South Wales. The thirteen year boom receded in 1842 when economic depression temporarily halted expansion. During this period however 53 new towns and villages were planned by the colonial administration.<ref name=nswshr-127/>\n\nMany Australian towns originated because of the need for provision of services. Typically, an inn would be established on a colonial road and then other service establishments would be attracted to the location, such as a general store, blacksmith, wheelwright etc. The colonial roads contained many such hamlets providing for travellers needs.<ref name=nswshr-127/>\n\nThe essential qualities of a service town are that it serves a population outside its own boundaries and produces services for sale rather than goods. Marulan began as one such service town in the early days of the boom period of the 1830s.<ref name=nswshr-127/>\n\nThe colonial administration was responsible for the setting aside of land for villages and town reserves and subsequently for design and layout of these centres. The decision as to their location was based upon constraints relating to the nature of the settlement. Thus the site for a service town would be determined largely by transport routes. Since river and road transport antedated selection of town sites in most cases, they exerted a controlling influence on site location.<ref name=nswshr-127/>\n\nA town of the 1830s was often no more than a small cluster of buildings and this remained the situation even during the land boom of the 1830s. Apart from the wayside public house, the smallest settlements were hamlets, recognised by the possession of a general store and a blacksmith or shoemaker. In the south, [[Gunning, New South Wales|Gunning]], [[Bungendore]] and Marulan, which depended on road traffic represented this type of town.<ref name=nswshr-127/>\n\nThe town plans drawn up by the [[Surveyor General of New South Wales|Surveyor General]]'s office reflected the size and type of the individual town. In contrast to the major regional centres, ordinary towns and villages were not given detailed layout plans and the smaller villages such as Marulan, designed to provide services to travellers, were characterised by linear plans following a largely single street pattern.<ref name=nswshr-127/>\n\nBy reserving an area for a village prior to the growth of that district a certain primacy was afforded to that location. Any businessmen who considered locating outside the government reserve would have faced considerable disadvantages.<ref name=nswshr-127/>\n\nThe advantages of the village sites were that within the reserved area\n# It was possible to purchase a small parcel of land\n# post offices and government buildings were available\n# mailcoaches stopped\n# The government was required to provide services and improved conditions.<ref name=nswshr-127/>\n\nThe disadvantages of other locations stifled development away from the reserve.<ref name=nswshr-127/>\n\nWithin the Marulan district only one location possessed the features to satisfy the requirement of a village reserve and that was where the village began.<ref name=nswshr-127/>\n\n=== Site selection ===\n\nThe [[Great South Road (New South Wales)|Great South Road]], south of the [[Cumberland Plain]], was first marked out by Surveyor-General Mitchell in 1829-30. It ran parallel to the coast and passed through the village of [[Bungonia, New South Wales|Bungonia]]. A branch road was also marked out to leave the main line at the beginning of the Marulan Range. This road was to lead to the [[Goulburn, New South Wales|Goulburn]] Plains and township.<ref name=nswshr-127/>\n\nMitchell then returned to select suitable sites for the founding of towns and villages. At the junction of the roads from Bungonia and Goulburn he selected a place to serve the travellers on these new roads. The name given to the site was Marulan. He saw the function of the village as that of a wayside settlement and so chose the site where traffic would be greatest. He also noted the importance of a supply of fresh water and as Barber's Creek was nearby this constraint could be satisfied.<ref name=nswshr-127/>\n\nMitchell instructed a surveyor to lay out some allotments to allow occupation in 1834, although the design of the complete village had not yet been approved. Apparently requests had been made for the early subdivision of sites.<ref name=nswshr-127/>\n\n=== The development of the village ===\n\nMarulan was given a simple design with no side streets and with all allotments having frontages to the major roads. The design is unusual in that it does not conform to the 1829 Government regulations for the laying out of towns and villages, presumably because there was no intention for Marulan to become a town.<ref name=nswshr-127/>\n\nDue to the road junctions, reservations were provided on three corners of the intersection, with the largest reservation on the high side of the junction being the Church reserve, maintaining the tradition of allocating the most prominent position in a settlement to the church. All other allotments were equally placed around the road junction. Approval of the design was notified in March 1835<ref name=nswshr-127/>\n\nOne of the first buildings in the village area was the Woolpack Inn, built by Joseph Peters in 1835. Confusion and concern about the future of the village plan in 1835 had prompted Peters to write to the Surveyor General referring to the fact that he had \"nearly\" completed a large brick house and stable for the accommodation of the public, and would be unjustly injured if the road was realigned further. Fortunately for Peters the line of the road was not altered.<ref name=nswshr-127/>\n\nSubsequently, Peters applied to be the Marulan postmaster and was appointed so in 1836. Also at this time a blacksmiths shop was established, and together with the inn and post office, supplied the basic needs of the travellers.<ref name=nswshr-127/>\n\nIn 1841 the Church Reserve was surveyed with three allotments being created for a church, a dwelling and a school. On a visit in 1847 Bishop [[William Broughton (bishop)|William Broughton]] inspected the \"commodious chapel in which the divine service is periodically performed\".<ref name=nswshr-127/>\n\nDuring the late 1830s and 1840s the sale of land at Marulan continued and the original design of the village was extended. The first additional allotments merely extended the village linearly along the Great South Road, but later depth was added to the village. As the need arose for house sites, side streets were included and allotments were surveyed with frontage to these minor streets. There were however probably not as many residents as appears from the number of lots in the village as often one person owned several lots and other areas were held by absentee landholders.<ref name=nswshr-127/>\n\nA decade after the founding of the settlement it was described as \"a small cluster of houses with two inns, a post office and three or four stores procuring custom.\"<ref>([[The Sydney Morning Herald|Sydney Morning Herald]], 11 January 1847)</ref><ref name=nswshr-127/>\n\nA notice of sale appeared in the Sydney Morning Herald of 18 February 1850 relating to four allotments in the centre of the village and described as the land at the corner of Barbour Street and opposite the Woolpack Inn. The notice refers to the following improvements:<ref name=nswshr-127/>\n\n# The Australian Store, with attached four bedroom dwelling of brick construction on stone footings;\n# A schoolhouse of timber slabs;\n# A stable for five horses with loft; and\n# A court house of brick on stone foundation, lately out of use, the Court having been discontinued since 1 January 1850<ref name=nswshr-127/>\n\nAll the buildings offered for sale were described as being large and of sound construction.<ref name=nswshr-127/>\n\n=== The railway ===\n\nDuring the 1840s there was much discussion of the possibility of a southern railway either along the line of the Great South Road or through Goulburn.<ref name=nswshr-127/>\n\nThe decision was finally made in favour of Goulburn. Nevertheless, for the route of the railway Marulan was an important point for it stood on the ridge which separated the valleys of the [[Shoalhaven River]] and the [[Wollondilly River]]. This was the narrowest piece of land between the two rivers so that whatever route was chosen it had to pass in the vicinity of the village.<ref name=nswshr-127/>\n\nPressure was applied on the government by many local landowners wishing to profit from the proximity of the railway to their land. It would seem that some at least had more influence than the Marulan residents for when finally drawn up in 1857 and confirmed by legislation in 1862 the line passed to the north of the village and not sufficiently near to it to ensure the village's future.<ref name=nswshr-127/>\n\nThe political decision to so locate the railway completely changed the patterns and means of transport in that district. For Marulan specifically it meant that the village no longer had access to through traffic and had to move to the point where the two transport corridors crossed. If the village had refused to move it is most probable that a completely new settlement would have been founded near the railway.<ref name=nswshr-127/>\n\n=== The new town site ===\n\nAt the time of construction of the railway, the population in the neighbourhood of Marulan increased, however at the end of 1867, as work on the viaduct across Barber's Creek neared completion, many of the railway workers moved to the next section of the line.<ref name=nswshr-127/>\n\n[[John Morrice]], the owner of the property \"Glenrock\", took advantage of the railways construction by subdividing the land fronting the main road in the vicinity of the railway. He named this town Mooroowoolen, and an advertisement for the sale of lots appeared in 1867. It was about 2 miles from Marulan.<ref name=nswshr-127/>\n\nUnfortunately for Morrice the railway station was not opened until August, 1868, and the demand for his sites was poor. The only real interest was shown by those who operated businesses at Marulan. The Marulan Postmaster and storekeeper, John O'Neill erected new premises at Mooroowoolen and the Mooroowoolen post office operated after February 1868. The inns at the old town were closed, also relocating near the railway.<ref name=nswshr-127/>\n\nAn article in the \"Sydney Morning Herald\" of 12 May 1868, described the impact of the railway:<ref name=nswshr-127/>\n<blockquote>\n\"The railway crosses the main road at right angles to the little township of Mooroowoolen. Marulan is a curiosity in townships.  At one time it was a thriving and busy place, but now the buildings are going to decay, and there seems little prospect of improvement.\"<ref name=nswshr-127/>\n</blockquote>\n\nSince most of the children attending the Marulan Public School had moved to Mooroowoolen it was decided to also move the school. Temporary premises were rented from June 1870 and occupation of a new school on a site donated by John Morrice commenced in December, 1871.<ref name=nswshr-127/>\n\nA new stone church was opened at Mooroowoolen on 1 October 1878 replacing the chapel at the old town site. The moving of the church represented the final stage of the relocation of Marulan.<ref name=nswshr-127/>\n\nGradually Mooroowoolen became known as Marulan. The old township was in a state of ruin and the new town contained all the relevant services to cater for the needs of travellers. The function of the settlement had not changed and the layout of the new township was similar to that of the original village; its form remained basically linear still focussing on the main road.<ref name=nswshr-127/>\n\n== Description ==\nA village plan still exists. The Hume Highway (formerly the Great South Road), Bungonia Street and Barber Street remain in present use, and a number of other streets are still identifiable. Barber Street currently provides access to trucks carrying material from mines in Bungonia Gorge although the road alignment has been altered at the intersection of the highway.<ref name=nswshr-127/>\n\nThis plan is the final plan of the village layout dated and a series of earlier plans of the growing town have been located dated 1835, 1839, 1841. A detailed description of archaeological features and relics is located in the field survey.<ref name=nswshr-127/>\n\n=== (i) Eastern Section ===\n\nRemains of the town buildings and associated structures are concentrated on the eastern side of the highway. The approximate position of the N/S property boundaries along the highway is indicated by a fence line with heavy vertical timber posts.<ref name=nswshr-127/>\n\nField survey has identified the position of a substantial number of surface features in these areas associated with the original township.<ref name=nswshr-127/>\n\nThese include:\n\n:(a)  [[Foundation (engineering)|foundations]] of a line of stone, brick and slab buildings which once stood along the highway\n:(b) evidence of domestic planting\n:(c) remains of fences, walls and hedges along property boundaries\n:(d) depressions representing the alignment of streets\n:(e) refuse piles containing domestic debris\n:(f) one substantial (possible) communal well\n:(g) evidence of a blacksmith's forge\n:(h) an industrial area containing evidence of brick and lime manufacture for the production of building materials\n:(i) concentrations of brick, worked stone and artefact scatters indicating previous human occupation of the land\n:(j) various other features such as rectangular depressions and large bramble brushes which are characteristic of disturbed land resulting from human occupation\n:(k) two cemeteries containing burials from the period of settlement to the present time<ref name=nswshr-127/>\n\n=== (ii) Western Section ===\n\nWhile the greatest number of sites have been identified on the eastern side of the highway, evidence of the previous occupation is apparent on the western side of the highway.<ref name=nswshr-127/>\n\nSites include:\n\n:(i)  a concentration of ceramic and glass fragments and a small number of broken bricks was found on the grass verge on the DMR reserve; though disturbed, it would appear that the material relates to the site of the Woolpack Inn known to have stood on this land.<ref name=nswshr-127/>\n:(ii)  mature introduced vegetation in Section 7, indicative of early garden planting<ref name=nswshr-127/>\n:(iii)  a large bramble bush (section 5) possibly represents an early building site<ref name=nswshr-127/>\n\nField survey did not locate relics in Section 5 or \"Appendix B\".<ref name=nswshr-127/>\n\n=== Archaeological evidence ===\n\nThe concentration of surface finds in some areas indicates the location of subsurface, stratified archaeological deposits; however, no systematic archaeological excavation has been undertaken within the curtilage. The deposits of archaeological significance indicating the nature of occupation and settlement of Old Marulan Town are distributed throughout the site.<ref name=nswshr-127/>\n\nSurface evidence predominates in some sections of the site and it can be predicted that the whole site contains covered relics which are not visible without excavation.<ref name=nswshr-127/>\n\n== Heritage listing ==\nThe site of Old Marulan Town is considered to be an outstanding archaeological resource which is able to vividly illustrate unrecorded details of Australian history relating to the form and functions of an early colonial service town, and the way of life of its inhabitants. Examination of the ground surface indicates that the total area of the site contains relics relating to the early occupation of the town. Future archaeological research of the site should result in a wealth of information which is only suggested from surface findings. The significance of the relics and deposits within the land is heightened by the limited period of the town's existence and the subsequent lack of further development of the land. The site therefore is a rare \"time capsule\" relating to colonial town life from 1835-67 which has suffered minimal contamination from later phases of use. Exploitation of the site in order to gather historic information would necessitate the preparation of a full research study prior to archaeological excavation of any part of the site in order that all possible avenues of research be considered.<ref name=nswshr-127/>\n\nOld Marulan Town was listed on the [[New South Wales State Heritage Register]] on 2 April 1999 having satisfied the following criteria.<ref name=nswshr-127/>\n\n'''The place is important in demonstrating aesthetic characteristics and/or a high degree of creative or technical achievement in New South Wales.'''\n\nThe town site is a valuable historical and archaeological site rich in information relative to the formand function of an early colonial country town and the way of life of its inhabitants. It was established in the earliest expansions of town and village settlement beyond the Cumberland Plain.<ref name=nswshr-127/>\n\n'''The place possesses uncommon, rare or endangered aspects of the cultural or natural history of New South Wales.'''\n\nOld Marulan's significance is two-fold. First, the number of towns dating from this early period which were not developed after the 1860s is very small. Those known to exist include [[Carrington, New South Wales (Mid-Coast Council)|Carrington]], [[Boydtown, New South Wales|Boydtown]] and towns associated with mining activities.<ref name=nswshr-127/>\n\nSecond, although roughly of the same period, Old Marulan is unlike these other town sites. The mining \"towns\" were mainly canvas settlements built for a transient and itinerant population and generally contained few buildings of even a semipermanent nature. Examples of this type of township include [[Hill End, New South Wales|Hill End]], Byng and Silvertown from the 1850s and 60's and [[Newnes, New South Wales|Newnes]] and [[Glen Davis, New South Wales|Glen Davis]] and [[Joadja, New South Wales|Joadja]] from the turn of the century.<ref name=nswshr-127/>\n\n== See also ==\n{{Portal|New South Wales}}\n\n== References ==\n{{commons category|Old Marulan Town}}\n{{reflist}}\n\n=== Attribution ===\n{{NSW-SHR-CC|name=Old Marulan Town|dno=5045370|id=00127|year=2018|accessdate=1 June 2018}}\n\n[[Category:New South Wales State Heritage Register]]\n[[Category:Marulan, New South Wales]]\n[[Category:Articles incorporating text from the New South Wales State Heritage Register]]\n", "text_old": "<!-- Article title: Old Marulan Town SHRNo:127 DatabaseNo:5045370 -->\n{{Use Australian English|date=June 2018}}\n{{Use dmy dates|date=June 2018}}\n{{Infobox historic site \n| name = Old Marulan Town\n| image = 127 - Old Marulan Town - PCO Plan Number 127 (5045370p1).jpg\n| caption = Heritage boundaries\n| locmapin = New South Wales\n| map_caption = \n| coordinates = {{coord|-34.7296|149.9835|region:AU-NSW_type:landmark|display=inline,title}}\n| map_relief = yes\n| location = [[Marulan, New South Wales|Marulan]], [[Goulburn Mulwaree Council]], [[New South Wales]], Australia\n| area = \n| elevation = \n| height = \n| beginning_label = Design period\n| beginning_date = \n| formed = \n| founded = \n| built = 1835&ndash;1867\n| built_for = \n| demolished = \n| architect = \n| architecture = \n| owner = [[Roads and Maritime Services]]; [[Telstra]] Corporation; Trustees Church of England; Trustees of the Roman Catholic Church\n| designation1 = New South Wales State Heritage Register\n| designation1_offname = Old Marulan Town; Site of old Marulan Town; Whole of Township\n| designation1_type = state heritage (archaeological-terrestrial)\n| designation1_date = 2 April 1999\n| delisted1_date = \n| designation1_partof = \n| designation1_number = 127\n| designation1_free1name =  Type\n| designation1_free1value = Townscape\n| designation1_free2name =  Category\n| designation1_free2value = Urban Area\n| designation1_free3name = Builders\n| designation1_free3value = \n}}\n\n'''Old Marulan Town''' is a heritage-listed former townscape at [[Marulan, New South Wales|Marulan]], [[Goulburn Mulwaree Council]], [[New South Wales]], Australia.

At one time it was a thriving and busy place, but now the buildings are going to decay, and there seems little prospect of improvement.\"<ref name=nswshr-127/>\n</blockquote>\n\nSince most of the children attending the Marulan Public School had moved to Mooroowoolen it was decided to also move the school. Temporary premises were rented from June 1870 and occupation of a new school on a site donated by John Morrice commenced in December, 1871.<ref name=nswshr-127/>\n\nA new stone church was opened at Mooroowoolen on 1 October 1878 replacing the chapel at the old town site. The moving of the church represented the final stage of the relocation of Marulan.<ref name=nswshr-127/>\n\nGradually Mooroowoolen became known as Marulan. The old township was in a state of ruin and the new town contained all the relevant services to cater for the needs of travellers. The function of the settlement had not changed and the layout of the new township was similar to that of the original village; its form remained basically linear still focussing on the main road.<ref name=nswshr-127/>\n\n== Description ==\nA village plan still exists. The Hume Highway (formerly the Great South Road), Bungonia Street and Barber Street remain in present use, and a number of other streets are still identifiable. Barber Street currently provides access to trucks carrying material from mines in Bungonia Gorge although the road alignment has been altered at the intersection of the highway.<ref name=nswshr-127/>\n\nThis plan is the final plan of the village layout dated and a series of earlier plans of the growing town have been located dated 1835, 1839, 1841. A detailed description of archaeological features and relics is located in the field survey.<ref name=nswshr-127/>\n\n=== (i) Eastern Section ===\n\nRemains of the town buildings and associated structures are concentrated on the eastern side of the highway. The approximate position of the N/S property boundaries along the highway is indicated by a fence line with heavy vertical timber posts.<ref name=nswshr-127/>\n\nField survey has identified the position of a substantial number of surface features in these areas associated with the original township.<ref name=nswshr-127/>\n\nThese include:\n\n:(a)  [[Foundation (engineering)|foundations]] of a line of stone, brick and slab buildings which once stood along the highway\n:(b) evidence of domestic planting\n:(c) remains of fences, walls and hedges along property boundaries\n:(d) depressions representing the alignment of streets\n:(e) refuse piles containing domestic debris\n:(f) one substantial (possible) communal well\n:(g) evidence of a blacksmith's forge\n:(h) an industrial area containing evidence of brick and lime manufacture for the production of building materials\n:(i) concentrations of brick, worked stone and artefact scatters indicating previous human occupation of the land\n:(j) various other features such as rectangular depressions and large bramble brushes which are characteristic of disturbed land resulting from human occupation\n:(k) two cemeteries containing burials from the period of settlement to the present time<ref name=nswshr-127/>\n\n=== (ii) Western Section ===\n\nWhile the greatest number of sites have been identified on the eastern side of the highway, evidence of the previous occupation is apparent on the western side of the highway.<ref name=nswshr-127/>\n\nSites include:\n\n:(i)  a concentration of ceramic and glass fragments and a small number of broken bricks was found on the grass verge on the DMR reserve; though disturbed, it would appear that the material relates to the site of the Woolpack Inn known to have stood on this land.<ref name=nswshr-127/>\n:(ii)  mature introduced vegetation in Section 7, indicative of early garden planting<ref name=nswshr-127/>\n:(iii)  a large bramble bush (section 5) possibly represents an early building site<ref name=nswshr-127/>\n\nField survey did not locate relics in Section 5 or \"Appendix B\".<ref name=nswshr-127/>\n\n=== Archaeological evidence ===\n\nThe concentration of surface finds in some areas indicates the location of subsurface, stratified archaeological deposits; however, no systematic archaeological excavation has been undertaken within the curtilage. The deposits of archaeological significance indicating the nature of occupation and settlement of Old Marulan Town are distributed throughout the site.<ref name=nswshr-127/>\n\nSurface evidence predominates in some sections of the site and it can be predicted that the whole site contains covered relics which are not visible without excavation.<ref name=nswshr-127/>\n\n== Heritage listing ==\nThe site of Old Marulan Town is considered to be an outstanding archaeological resource which is able to vividly illustrate unrecorded details of Australian history relating to the form and functions of an early colonial service town, and the way of life of its inhabitants. Examination of the ground surface indicates that the total area of the site contains relics relating to the early occupation of the town. Future archaeological research of the site should result in a wealth of information which is only suggested from surface findings. The significance of the relics and deposits within the land is heightened by the limited period of the towns existence and the subsequent lack of further development of the land. The site therefore is a rare \"time capsule\" relating to colonial town life from 1835-67 which has suffered minimal contamination from latter phases of use. Exploitation of the site in order to gather historic information would necessitate the preparation of a full research study prior to archaeological excavation of any part of the site in order that all possible avenues of research be considered.<ref name=nswshr-127/>\n\nOld Marulan Town was listed on the [[New South Wales State Heritage Register]] on 2 April 1999 having satisfied the following criteria.<ref name=nswshr-127/>\n\n'''The place is important in demonstrating aesthetic characteristics and/or a high degree of creative or technical achievement in New South Wales.'''\n\nThe town site is a valuable historical and archaeological site rich in information relative to the formand function of an early colonial country town and the way of life of its inhabitants. It was established in the earliest expansions of town and village settlement beyond the Cumberland Plain.<ref name=nswshr-127/>\n\n'''The place possesses uncommon, rare or endangered aspects of the cultural or natural history of New South Wales.'''\n\nOld Marulan's significance is two-fold. First, the number of towns dating from this early period which were not developed after the 1860s is very small. Those known to exist include [[Carrington, New South Wales (Mid-Coast Council)|Carrington]], [[Boydtown, New South Wales|Boydtown]] and towns associated with mining activities.<ref name=nswshr-127/>\n\nSecond, although roughly of the same period, Old Marulan is unlike these other town sites. The mining \"towns\" were mainly canvas settlements built for a transient and itinerant population and generally contained few buildings of even a semipermanent nature. Examples of this type of township include [[Hill End, New South Wales|Hill End]], Byng and Silvertown from the 1850s and 60's and [[Newnes, New South Wales|Newnes]] and [[Glen Davis, New South Wales|Glen Davis]] and [[Joadja, New South Wales|Joadja]] from the turn of the century.<ref name=nswshr-127/>\n\n== See also ==\n{{Portal|New South Wales}}\n\n== References ==\n{{commons category|Old Marulan Town}}\n{{reflist}}\n\n=== Attribution ===\n{{NSW-SHR-CC|name=Old Marulan Town|dno=5045370|id=00127|year=2018|accessdate=1 June 2018}}\n\n[[Category:New South Wales State Heritage Register]]\n[[Category:Marulan, New South Wales]]\n[[Category:Articles incorporating text from the New South Wales State Heritage Register]]\n", "name_user": "John of Reading", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eHeritage listing:Typo fixing, replaced: towns existence \u2192 town's existence", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Old_Marulan_Town"}

The political background to this new law was that Germany, for the first time ever, was acknowledged to be a destination for immigrants. The practical changes{{clarify|date=December 2014}} to immigration procedures were relatively minor. New immigration categories, such as \"highly skilled professional\" and \"scientist\" were introduced to attract valuable professionals to the German labour market. The development within German immigration law shows that immigration of skilled employees and academics has eased{{clarify|date=December 2014}} while the labour market remains closed for unskilled workers.\n\nIn April 2012, [[Blue Card (European Union)|European Blue Card]] legislation was implemented in Germany, allowing highly skilled non-EU citizens easier access to work and live in Germany, subject to certain requirements. According to the federal statistics office in 2016, over one out of five Germans has at least partial roots outside of the country.<ref>{{Cite web | url=https://www.destatis.de/DE/PresseService/Presse/Pressemitteilungen/2017/08/PD17_261_12511.html |title = Bev\u00f6lkerung mit Migrationshintergrund um 8,5 % gestiegen}}</ref>\n\nFrom March 2020, new rules \u2013 in the form of the Skilled Immigration Act \u2013 have come into force. The new law extends the opportunities for immigration to Germany for qualified professionals that are from outside the European Union [[https://india.diplo.de/in-en/themen/-/2315040 1]]\n\nPrior to applying for a visa under the new rules, those interested have to get an official recognition of their professional qualification. The recognition must be from a German authority deemed to be competent to do so.\n\nTo be eligible for a German visa for skilled workers, the applicant must have their foreign certification or degree duly certified by a German authority, meet the required language competency, and if with a valid job offer in Germany, ask their employer to fill up a Declaration. The declaration to be filled up by the Germany-based employer on behalf of an overseas-born worker is termed Erkl\u00e4rung zum Besch\u00e4ftigungsverh\u00e4ltnis or \u201cDeclaration regarding a contract of employment\u201d [[https://india.diplo.de/in-en/themen/-/2315040 2]]\n\nUnder the newly enforced Skilled Immigration Act, a visa application by a skilled worker will be accepted by the German Embassy and German Consulates only after the recognition of the foreign qualification of the skilled worker.\n\nFast-tracked applications can be submitted by the employer as well.\n\nThe Skilled Immigration Act is also referred to as Fachkr\u00e4fte-Einwanderungsgesetz. [[https://india.diplo.de/in-en/themen/-/2315040 3]]\n\nAs per the Institute of Employment Research [IAB] by the year 2060 Germany will have an annual immigration requirement of at least 260,000.

Due to a shortage of laborers during the [[Wirtschaftswunder]] (\"economic miracle\") in the 1950s and 1960s, the West German government signed bilateral recruitment agreements with [[Italy]] in 1955, [[Greece]] in 1960, [[Turkey]] in 1961, [[Morocco]] in 1963, [[Portugal]] in 1964, [[Tunisia]] in 1965 and [[Yugoslavia]] in 1968. These agreements allowed the recruitment of so-called ''[[Gastarbeiter]]'' (\"guest workers\") to work in the industrial sector in jobs that required few qualifications.\nChildren born to 'Gastarbeiter' received the right to reside in Germany but were not granted citizenship; this was known as the ''Aufenthaltsberechtigung'' (\"right of residence\"). Many of the descendants of those ''Gastarbeiter'' still live in Germany and many have acquired German citizenship.\n\nThe [[German Democratic Republic]] (GDR) recruited workers from outside its borders differently. It criticized the Gastarbeiter policy, calling it capitalist exploitation of poor foreigners, and preferred to see its foreign workers as socialist \"friends\" who traveled to the GDR from other communist or socialist countries in order to learn skills which could then be applied in their home countries. Most of these came from [[North Vietnam]], [[North Korea]], [[Angola]], [[Mozambique]] and [[Cuba]].\nFollowing [[German reunification]] in 1990 many foreign workers in the new federal states of the former GDR had no legal status as immigrant workers under the Western system. Consequently, many faced deportation or premature termination of residence and work permits, as well as open discrimination in the workplace.\n\n===1980-1993===\nDuring the 1980s, a small but steady stream of East Germans immigrating to the West (''\u00dcbersiedler'') had begun with the gradual opening of the Eastern bloc. It swelled to 389,000 in 1990. After the immigration law change in 1993, it decreased by more than half to 172,000.<ref name=solsten>{{cite web|author1=Eric Solsten|title=Germany: A Country Study; Chapter: Immigration|url=http://countrystudies.us/germany/89.htm|publisher=GPO for the Library of Congress|accessdate=5 January 2015|location=Washington DC|date=1995}}</ref>\n[[File:Bundesarchiv B 145 Bild-F079036-0016, Lager Friedland, Familie aus Kasachstan.jpg|left|thumb| German repatriates from [[Kazakhstan]] arriving in a camp in [[Friedland, Lower Saxony|Friedland]] in 1988]]\n\nDuring the same time, the number of [[German diaspora|ethnic Germans]] (''Aussiedler'') -Germans who had settled in German territory sometimes for centuries until WWII, i.e. in present-day Eastern Europe and Russia- began to rise in the mid-1980s to about 40,000 each year. In 1987, the number doubled, in 1988 it doubled again and in 1990 nearly 400,000 immigrated.\nUpon arrival, ethnic Germans became citizens at once according to Article 116 of the Basic Law, and received financial and many social benefits, including language training, as many did not speak German. Social integration was often difficult, even though ethnic Germans were entitled to German citizenship, but to many Germans they did not seem German. In 1991, restrictions went into effect, in that ethnic Germans were assigned to certain areas, losing benefits if they were moving. The German government also encouraged the estimated several million ethnic Germans living in the former Soviet Union and Eastern Europe to remain there. Since January 1993, no more than 220,000 ethnic Germans may immigrate per year.<ref name=solsten/>\n\nAnd in parallel a third stream of immigration starting in the mid 1980s were [[war refugee]]s, of which West Germany accepted more than any other West European country due to an unqualified [[right to asylum]].

The political background to this new law was that Germany, for the first time ever, was acknowledged to be a destination for immigrants. The practical changes{{clarify|date=December 2014}} to immigration procedures were relatively minor. New immigration categories, such as \"highly skilled professional\" and \"scientist\" were introduced to attract valuable professionals to the German labour market. The development within German immigration law shows that immigration of skilled employees and academics has eased{{clarify|date=December 2014}} while the labour market remains closed for unskilled workers.\n\nIn April 2012, [[Blue Card (European Union)|European Blue Card]] legislation was implemented in Germany, allowing highly skilled non-EU citizens easier access to work and live in Germany, subject to certain requirements. According to the federal statistics office in 2016, over one out of five Germans has at least partial roots outside of the country.<ref>{{Cite web | url=https://www.destatis.de/DE/PresseService/Presse/Pressemitteilungen/2017/08/PD17_261_12511.html |title = Bev\u00f6lkerung mit Migrationshintergrund um 8,5 % gestiegen}}</ref>\n\n==History of immigration to Germany==\n[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 183-01986-09083, Schwarza, kubanische Gastarbeiterin.jpg|upright=0.7|thumb|A so-called \"guest worker\" (''[[Gastarbeiter]]in'') from [[Cuba]], working in an [[German Democratic Republic|East German]] factory, 1986]]\n\n===After World War II until reunification (1945-1980)===\n{{unreferenced section|date=January 2015}}\n{{see also|Eastern Bloc emigration and defection#Emigration restrictions|Turks in Germany|Vietnamese people in Germany}}\n\nTowards the end of World War II,and in its aftermath, up to 12 million refugees of [[ethnic Germans]], so-called \"[[Heimatvertriebene]]\" (German for \"expellees\", literally \"homeland displaced persons\") were forced to migrate from the former German areas, as for instance [[Silesia]] or [[East Prussia]], to the new formed States of [[Allied-occupied Germany|post-war Germany]] and [[Allied-occupied Austria]], because of changing borderlines in Europe.<ref name=\"spo\">[http://www.spiegel.de/spiegel/spiegelgeschichte/d-76574305.html], SpiegelOnline 25 January 2011.</ref><ref name=\"kas\">[http://www.kas.de/wf/de/71.8807/ \"Konrad Adenauer Stiftung\" ], viewed on 31 March 2015.</ref>  A big wave of immigration to Germany started in the 1960s. Due to a shortage of laborers during the [[Wirtschaftswunder]] (\"economic miracle\") in the 1950s and 1960s, the West German government signed bilateral recruitment agreements with [[Italy]] in 1955, [[Greece]] in 1960, [[Turkey]] in 1961, [[Morocco]] in 1963, [[Portugal]] in 1964, [[Tunisia]] in 1965 and [[Yugoslavia]] in 1968. These agreements allowed the recruitment of so-called ''[[Gastarbeiter]]'' (\"guest workers\") to work in the industrial sector in jobs that required few qualifications.\nChildren born to 'Gastarbeiter' received the right to reside in Germany but were not granted citizenship; this was known as the ''Aufenthaltsberechtigung'' (\"right of residence\"). Many of the descendants of those ''Gastarbeiter'' still live in Germany and many have acquired German citizenship.\n\nThe [[German Democratic Republic]] (GDR) recruited workers from outside its borders differently. It criticized the Gastarbeiter policy, calling it capitalist exploitation of poor foreigners, and preferred to see its foreign workers as socialist \"friends\" who traveled to the GDR from other communist or socialist countries in order to learn skills which could then be applied in their home countries. Most of these came from [[North Vietnam]], [[North Korea]], [[Angola]], [[Mozambique]] and [[Cuba]].\nFollowing [[German reunification]] in 1990 many foreign workers in the new federal states of the former GDR had no legal status as immigrant workers under the Western system. Consequently, many faced deportation or premature termination of residence and work permits, as well as open discrimination in the workplace.\n\n===1980-1993===\nDuring the 1980s, a small but steady stream of East Germans immigrating to the West (''\u00dcbersiedler'') had begun with the gradual opening of the Eastern bloc. It swelled to 389,000 in 1990. After the immigration law change in 1993, it decreased by more than half to 172,000.<ref name=solsten>{{cite web|author1=Eric Solsten|title=Germany: A Country Study; Chapter: Immigration|url=http://countrystudies.us/germany/89.htm|publisher=GPO for the Library of Congress|accessdate=5 January 2015|location=Washington DC|date=1995}}</ref>\n[[File:Bundesarchiv B 145 Bild-F079036-0016, Lager Friedland, Familie aus Kasachstan.jpg|left|thumb| German repatriates from [[Kazakhstan]] arriving in a camp in [[Friedland, Lower Saxony|Friedland]] in 1988]]\n\nDuring the same time, the number of [[German diaspora|ethnic Germans]] (''Aussiedler'') -Germans who had settled in German territory sometimes for centuries until WWII, i.e. in present-day Eastern Europe and Russia- began to rise in the mid-1980s to about 40,000 each year. In 1987, the number doubled, in 1988 it doubled again and in 1990 nearly 400,000 immigrated.\nUpon arrival, ethnic Germans became citizens at once according to Article 116 of the Basic Law, and received financial and many social benefits, including language training, as many did not speak German. Social integration was often difficult, even though ethnic Germans were entitled to German citizenship, but to many Germans they did not seem German. In 1991, restrictions went into effect, in that ethnic Germans were assigned to certain areas, losing benefits if they were moving. The German government also encouraged the estimated several million ethnic Germans living in the former Soviet Union and Eastern Europe to remain there. Since January 1993, no more than 220,000 ethnic Germans may immigrate per year.<ref name=solsten/>\n\nAnd in parallel a third stream of immigration starting in the mid 1980s were [[war refugee]]s, of which West Germany accepted more than any other West European country due to an unqualified [[right to asylum]]. From 1986 to 1989, about 380,000 refugees sought asylum, mostly from Iran and Lebanon.

All ethnic crime gangs are collectively treated as organized crime.<ref name=\"sueddeutsche_29sep2018\"/>\n\nThe profitable activities of Arab clans have been noted by other minorities and Chechens, Albanians, Kosovars have created similar clan-based gangs. The clan-based structure has advantages in the individualised German society where people want to live in peace under the protection of the state. On the other hand, clans do not recognize rule of law and consider it incomprehensible that of police and courts protect people. A modern society only functions when people voluntarily follow its rules, while clan member consider themselves members of a family rather than citizens of a country. As such, they consider all people who follow the laws and rules weak and without protection.<ref name=\"sueddeutsche_29sep2018\">{{Cite news|url=https://www.sueddeutsche.de/panorama/aussenansicht-die-macht-der-clans-1.4147228|title=Die Macht der Clans|last=Ghadban|first=Ralph|date=28 September 2018|work=sueddeutsche.de|access-date=2018-09-29|language=de|issn=0174-4917}}</ref>\n{{clear}}\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|colwidth=30em}}\n\n==External links==\n{{Commons category|Immigration in Germany}}\n\n===Governmental===\n:[https://www.destatis.de/DE/ZahlenFakten/GesellschaftStaat/Bevoelkerung/MigrationIntegration/AuslaendischeBevolkerung/Tabellen/AuslaendischeBevoelkerungStaatsangehoerigkeit_pdf.pdf?__blob=publicationFile \"6.180,013\" Ausl\u00e4nder in Deutschland] \n:[http://www.bundespraesident.de/SharedDocs/Reden/DE/Joachim-Gauck/Reden/2015/09/150927-Interkulturelle-Woche-Mainz.html \"Unsere Aufnahmekapazit\u00e4t ist begrenzt, ...\"] \n:[http://www.auswaertiges-amt.de German Foreign Office]\n:[http://www.bamf.de/EN/Startseite/startseite-node.html Federal Office for Migration and Refugees]\n\n===Non-governmental===\n:[http://www.lg2g.info/entry Legal Guide to Germany]\n:[http://www.deutsch-werden.de German Citizenship Test]\n:[http://www.jinger.eu Information for moving to and working in Germany for immigrants]\n\n{{Immigration to Germany}}\n{{Germany topics}}\n{{Immigration to Europe}}\n\n[[Category:Immigration to Germany]]\n[[Category:Foreign relations of Germany]]\n\n[[de:Einwanderung#Einwanderung nach Deutschland]]\n", "name_user": "MeenakshiDeviP", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eHistory of immigration to Germany", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immigration_to_Germany"}

I knew I was banged up, but to my utter surprise my foot was flipped on its side looking very similar to a Nalgene bottle with just a sliver of skin keeping it on.\"\n<ref>{{cite web|last=Staff |first=Climbing |url=http://www.climbing.com/news/ammon-mcneely-survives-base-jumping-accident/ |title=Ammon McNeely survives BASE jumping accident |publisher=Climbing |date= |accessdate=2013-10-30}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.supertopo.com/climbing/thread.php?topic_id=2258496&tn=60 |title=Ammon McNeely :: SuperTopo Rock Climbing Discussion Topic - page 4 |publisher=Supertopo.com |date= |accessdate=2013-10-30}}</ref>\n\nIn October 2017, Ammon lost his right leg below the knee in a BASE accident in Moab. <ref>{{cite web|title=Ammon McNeely Seriously Injured in BASE Jumping Accident|url=https://www.climbing.com/news/ammon-mcneely-seriously-injured-in-base-jumping-accident/|website=Climbing Magazing|accessdate=12 October 2017}}</ref>\n\nSome of his other [[El Capitan]] speed climbing accomplishments include:\n\n*Lost World: 23:29 - w/Ivo Ninov July 7, 2009 (First One Day Ascent)\n*Never Never Land: 16:00:02 - w/[[Chris McNamara]] - August 4, 2004 (First One Day Ascent)\n*Horse Chute: 20:39 - w/Chris McNamara - Oct 8, 2004 (First One Day Ascent)\n*Magic Mushroom: 55:15 - w/[[Ivo Ninov]] & [[Kevin Jaramillo]] - July 4-6th, 2005\n*The Reticent Wall: 34:57 - w/[[Dean Potter]] & [[Ivo Ninov]] - July 12\u201313, 2006\n*Wall of Early Morning Light: 23:43 - w/[[Brian McCray]] - September, 2004 (First One Day Ascent)\n*Pacific Ocean Wall: 33:02 - w/[[Ivo Ninov]] - May, 2004\n*New Jersey Turnpike: 14:00:02 - w/[[Brian McCray]] - September, 2002\n*Atlantic Ocean Wall: 23:38 - w/[[Brian McCray]] - August 4, 2004 (First One Day Ascent)\n*Native Son: 23:53 - w/[[Ivo Ninov]] -  May 15, 2006 (First One Day Ascent)\n*Iron Hawk: 30:42 - w/[[Cedar Wright]] - May, 2004\n*Scorched Earth: 22:28 - w/Skiy Detray & David Allfrey\n*Tangerine Trip: 10:24 - w/[[Cedar Wright]] - July, 2002\n*Virginia: 17:24  - w/[[Gabriel McNeely]] & [[Ivo Ninov]] - July 16, 2005\n*Lost in America: 18:04 - w/[[Brian McCray]] - August, 2004\n*Zenyatta Mondatta: 22:56 - w/[[Ivo Nivov]] & [[Kevin Jaramillo]] - June  27, 2005 (First One Day Ascent)\n*Plastic Surgery Disaster: 21:37 - w/[[Brian McCray]] - June, 2001 (First One Day Ascent)\n*Lunar Eclipse: 19:58 - w/[[Jose Pererya]] & [[Chongo]] - June, 2001\n*Born Under a Bad Sign: 22:22 - w/[[Chris Van Luevan]] & [[Eric Walden]] - October 2, 2001 (First One Day Ascent)\n*Eagle's Way: 9:08 - w/[[Brian McCray]] - August, 2004\n*On the Waterfront: 17:07 - Skiy Detray & Ammon McNeely - July 15, 2009 (First One Day Ascent - 3rd overall Ascent)\n*Pressure Cooker: 23:41 - w/[[Ivo Ninov]] - September, 2004 (First One Day Ascent)\n*Get Whacked: 12:49 - w/[[Brian McCray]] - June, 2001 (First One Day Ascent)\n\n==References==\n\n\n<references />\n\n==External links==\n* [http://rocknclimb.com/ RocknClimb.com - Ammon's Website]\n* [http://www.alpinist.com/doc/ALP10/climbing-note-mcneely Alpinist Article - Nine Records in 2003]\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20080129132425/http://www.timmyoneill.com/zodiac.html Zodiac Ascent with Timmy O'Neill and his brother Sean, a paraplegic]\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20080522131652/http://www.climbing.com/news/hotflashes/nativeson1day One Day Ascent of Native Son]\n* [http://www.podclimber.com/?m=1&c=24&p=360&page=5 Podclimber Interview]\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20071229005859/http://www.climbing.com/photo-video/av/flyingmonkeys/ Video: Realm of the Flying Monkeys]\n* [http://www.rockclimbing.com/Articles/General/The_Zodiac_with_Ammon_McNeely_Hardman__60.html Article: The Zodiac with Ammon McNeely - written by Donald Perry]\n* [http://www.supertopo.com/tr/Gone_Sufferin_-_Rodeo_Queen_in_a_day_slide_show/t170n.html Gone Sufferin', Zion's Rodeo Queen - by: Chris McNamara]\n* [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tj7fStiEx_o Video: Ammon breaks leg during MOAB BASE jumping accident Oct2013.]\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:McNeely, Ammon}}\n[[Category:1970 births]]\n[[Category:Living people]]\n[[Category:American rock climbers]]\n", "name_user": "Will Sandberg", "label": "safe", "comment": "", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ammon_McNeely"}
