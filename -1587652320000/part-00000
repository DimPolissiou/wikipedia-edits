Lower lobes tend to be more involved. [[CT scan]]s show [[Interstitial space (biology)|interstitial]] infiltrates.<ref name=HPA14mar2013/>\n\n=== Laboratory testing ===\nMERS cases have been reported to have [[leucopenia|low white blood cell count]], and in particular [[lymphopenia|low lymphocytes]].<ref name=HPA14mar2013/> For PCR{{clarify|date=March 2020}} testing, the [[World Health Organization]] (WHO) recommends obtaining samples from the lower respiratory tract via [[bronchoalveolar lavage]] (BAL), [[sputum]] sample or [[trachea]]l aspirate as these have the highest viral loads.<ref name=WHOsep2013/> There have also been studies utilizing upper respiratory sampling via [[nasopharyngeal swab]].<ref name=Assiri9sep2013/>\n\nSeveral highly sensitive, confirmatory real-time [[RT-PCR]] assays exist for rapid identification of MERS-CoV from patient-derived samples. These assays attempt to amplify upE (targets elements upstream of the E gene),<ref name=Corman27sep2012/> open reading frame 1B (targets the ORF1b gene)<ref name=Corman27sep2012/> and open reading frame 1A (targets the ORF1a gene).<ref name=Corman6dec2012/> The WHO recommends the upE target for screening assays as it is highly sensitive.<ref name=WHOsep2013/> In addition, hemi-nested sequencing amplicons targeting RdRp (present in all [[coronavirus]]es) and nucleocapsid (N) gene<ref name=Lu1jan2014/> (specific to MERS-CoV) fragments can be generated for confirmation via sequencing. Reports of potential polymorphisms in the N gene between isolates highlight the necessity for sequence-based characterization.\n\nThe WHO recommended testing algorithm is to start with an upE RT-PCR and if positive confirm with ORF 1A assay or RdRp or N gene sequence assay for confirmation. If both an upE and secondary assay are positive it is considered a confirmed case.<ref name=WHOsep2013/>\n\nProtocols for biologically safe [[immunofluorescence]] assays (IFA) have also been developed; however, antibodies against [[coronavirus|betacoronaviruses]] are known to cross-react within the genus. This effectively limits their use to confirmatory applications.<ref name=Corman6dec2012/> A more specific protein-microarray based assay has also been developed that did not show any cross-reactivity against population samples and serum known to be positive for other betacoronaviruses.<ref name=Reusken4apr2013/> Due to the limited validation done so far with serological assays, WHO guidance is that \"cases where the testing laboratory has reported positive serological test results in the absence of PCR testing or sequencing, are considered probable cases of MERS-CoV infection, if they meet the other conditions of that case definition.\"<ref name=WHOsep2013/>\n\n==Prevention==\nWhile the mechanism of spread of MERS-CoV is currently not known, based on experience with prior coronaviruses, such as SARS, the WHO currently recommends that all individuals coming into contact with MERS suspects should (in addition to standard precautions):\n* Wear a medical mask\n* Wear eye protection (i.e. goggles or a face shield)\n* Wear a clean, non sterile, long sleeved gown; and gloves (some procedures may require sterile gloves)\n* Perform hand hygiene before and after contact with the person and his or her surroundings and immediately after removal of [[personal protective equipment]] (PPE)<ref name=WHO6may2013/>\nFor procedures which carry a risk of aerosolization, such as intubation, the WHO recommends that care providers also:\n* Wear a particulate respirator and, when putting on a disposable particulate respirator, always check the seal\n* Wear eye protection (i.e. goggles or a face shield)\n* Wear a clean, non-sterile, long-sleeved gown and gloves (some of these procedures require sterile gloves)\n* Wear an impermeable apron for some procedures with expected high fluid volumes that might penetrate the gown\n* Perform procedures in an adequately ventilated room; i.e. minimum of 6 to 12 air changes per hour in facilities with a mechanically ventilated room and at least 60 liters/second/patient in facilities with natural ventilation\n* Limit the number of persons present in the room to the absolute minimum required for the person's care and support\n* Perform hand hygiene before and after contact with the person and his or her surroundings and after [[Personal protective equipment|PPE]] removal.<ref name=WHO6may2013/>\nThe duration of infectivity is also unknown so it is unclear how long people must be isolated, but current recommendations are for 24 hours after resolution of symptoms. In the SARS outbreak the virus was not cultured from people after the resolution of their symptoms.<ref name=Chan2004feb/>\n\nIt is believed that the existing SARS research may provide a useful template for developing vaccines and therapeutics against a MERS-CoV infection.<ref name=Jiang2013/><ref name=Butler3oct2013/>.

These assays attempt to amplify upE (targets elements upstream of the E gene),<ref name=Corman27sep2012/> open reading frame 1B (targets the ORF1b gene)<ref name=Corman27sep2012/> and open reading frame 1A (targets the ORF1a gene).<ref name=Corman6dec2012/> The WHO recommends the upE target for screening assays as it is highly sensitive.<ref name=WHOsep2013/> In addition, hemi-nested sequencing amplicons targeting RdRp (present in all [[coronavirus]]es) and nucleocapsid (N) gene<ref name=Lu1jan2014/> (specific to MERS-CoV) fragments can be generated for confirmation via sequencing. Reports of potential polymorphisms in the N gene between isolates highlight the necessity for sequence-based characterization.\n\nThe WHO recommended testing algorithm is to start with an upE RT-PCR and if positive confirm with ORF 1A assay or RdRp or N gene sequence assay for confirmation. If both an upE and secondary assay are positive it is considered a confirmed case.<ref name=WHOsep2013/>\n\nProtocols for biologically safe [[immunofluorescence]] assays (IFA) have also been developed; however, antibodies against [[coronavirus|betacoronaviruses]] are known to cross-react within the genus. This effectively limits their use to confirmatory applications.<ref name=Corman6dec2012/> A more specific protein-microarray based assay has also been developed that did not show any cross-reactivity against population samples and serum known to be positive for other betacoronaviruses.<ref name=Reusken4apr2013/> Due to the limited validation done so far with serological assays, WHO guidance is that \"cases where the testing laboratory has reported positive serological test results in the absence of PCR testing or sequencing, are considered probable cases of MERS-CoV infection, if they meet the other conditions of that case definition.\"<ref name=WHOsep2013/>\n\n==Prevention==\nWhile the mechanism of spread of MERS-CoV is currently not known, based on experience with prior coronaviruses, such as SARS, the WHO currently recommends that all individuals coming into contact with MERS suspects should (in addition to standard precautions):\n* Wear a medical mask\n* Wear eye protection (i.e. goggles or a face shield)\n* Wear a clean, non sterile, long sleeved gown; and gloves (some procedures may require sterile gloves)\n* Perform hand hygiene before and after contact with the person and his or her surroundings and immediately after removal of [[personal protective equipment]] (PPE)<ref name=WHO6may2013/>\nFor procedures which carry a risk of aerosolization, such as intubation, the WHO recommends that care providers also:\n* Wear a particulate respirator and, when putting on a disposable particulate respirator, always check the seal\n* Wear eye protection (i.e. goggles or a face shield)\n* Wear a clean, non-sterile, long-sleeved gown and gloves (some of these procedures require sterile gloves)\n* Wear an impermeable apron for some procedures with expected high fluid volumes that might penetrate the gown\n* Perform procedures in an adequately ventilated room; i.e. minimum of 6 to 12 air changes per hour in facilities with a mechanically ventilated room and at least 60 liters/second/patient in facilities with natural ventilation\n* Limit the number of persons present in the room to the absolute minimum required for the person's care and support\n* Perform hand hygiene before and after contact with the person and his or her surroundings and after [[Personal protective equipment|PPE]] removal.<ref name=WHO6may2013/>\nThe duration of infectivity is also unknown so it is unclear how long people must be isolated, but current recommendations are for 24 hours after resolution of symptoms. In the SARS outbreak the virus was not cultured from people after the resolution of their symptoms.<ref name=Chan2004feb/>\n\nIt is believed that the existing SARS research may provide a useful template for developing vaccines and therapeutics against a MERS-CoV infection.<ref name=Jiang2013/><ref name=Butler3oct2013/>.
