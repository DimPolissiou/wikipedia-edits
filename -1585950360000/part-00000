Under current policy, all students (not just athletes) from families with annual incomes less than [[United States dollar|$]]180,000 pay at most 10% of family income, and those with family incomes under $60,000 receive full scholarships.

Although the Ivy League strictly prohibits [[athletic scholarship]]s, Harvard has adopted an aid scheme that makes the school far more accessible to low- and middle-income students. Under current policy, all students (not just athletes) from families with annual incomes less than [[United States dollar|$]]180,000 pay at most 10% of family income, and those with family incomes under $60,000 receive full scholarships. According to Jay Hart of [[Yahoo!

After graduation, she moved to England, where she worked for 10 years as a freelance producer and director for German television. Joy has directed and produced over 70 documentaries for international TV stations such as [[Channel 4]], [[National Geographic Society|National Geographic]], and [[Westdeutscher Rundfunk|WDR]]. Since 1990, the main focus of her work has been [[lifestyle (sociology)|lifestyle]] and [[Human sexuality|sexuality]]. A recurring topic was sexuality from a female perspective. Starting in 1992, she produced segments for \u201cLiebe S\u00fcnde\u201d, a programme about sex airing on the German satellite station Vox/Pro7.\n \nIn 2003, Joy launched Strawberry Seductress, an intimate and creative erotic photo service for women and couples and film production company.<ref name=\"sexualsushi1\">[http://www.sexualsushi.com/thedirector.asp ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090203054540/http://www.sexualsushi.com/thedirector.asp |date=February 3, 2009 }}</ref> In 2004, Joy filmed Sexual Sushi, her first alternative pornographic film for women. [[Harper Collins]] published her book ''How to Make Your Own Adult Video: The Couple\u2019s Guide to Making Sensual Home Movies'' in 2006. She then shot ''Female Fantasies'' and ''Feeling it, not faking it!''. In 2009, Joy established the Petra Joy Award, an international erotic film competition for first-time female directors. She runs \u201chow to make your own creative porn\u201d workshops and speaks on the subject of women and [[pornography]] across Europe. Joy curates and produces a feminist porn series called ''Her Porn'' and has shot a documentary called ''The Joy of Porn: My Life as a Feminist Pornographer''.\n\n== Erotic Film Production ==\nJoy started producing and directing erotic films in 2004 with the aim to show a more accurate reflection of female sexuality than mainstream porn filmmakers. She works exclusively with amateur performers, with the intention of capturing real chemistry, always shows safe sex, and has a policy never to show acts that can be perceived as being degrading to women. In contrast to mainstream porn that often focuses on shots of genitalia, Joy focused on the faces of the performers. Authentic sex scenes, men as sex objects, elaborate costumes, and taboo themes such as females penetrating males, and male bisexuality often feature in her films.\n\nOf her first erotic film, ''Sexual Sushi'', one reviewer wrote, \u201cPetra has achieved her aim of creating an antidote to \u2018porn junk food\u2019\u201d.<ref>[http://www.vinylla.co.uk/reviews/index.html ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100514122539/http://www.vinylla.co.uk/reviews/index.html |date=May 14, 2010 }}</ref>\n\nShe describes her inspiration as follows:\n\n\u201c... [C]ommercially successful porn does nothing for me: I want porn that stimulates the mind and feeds the soul. I want porn that is educational and inspirational. I want porn that is creative and kinky. And because I cannot find it anywhere, I make my own. I am a visual creature and enjoy expressing myself through photos and films that are very different from mainstream glamour photography and porn films.\u201d<ref name=\"sexualsushi1\"/>\n\nIn 2009, she curated and produced the first installment of the ''Her Porn'' series with the aim of showing a variety of female erotic visions. ''Her Porn 2'' is to be released in April 2010.

After graduation, she moved to England, where she worked for 10 years as a freelance producer and director for German television. Joy has directed and produced over 70 documentaries for international TV stations such as [[Channel 4]], [[National Geographic Society|National Geographic]], and [[Westdeutscher Rundfunk|WDR]]. Since 1990, the main focus of her work has been [[lifestyle (sociology)|lifestyle]] and [[Human sexuality|sexuality]]. A recurring topic was sexuality from a female perspective. Starting in 1992, she produced segments for \u201cLiebe S\u00fcnde\u201d, a programme about sex airing on the German satellite station Vox/Pro7.\n \nIn 2003, Joy launched Strawberry Seductress, an intimate and creative erotic photo service for women and couples and film production company.<ref name=\"sexualsushi1\">[http://www.sexualsushi.com/thedirector.asp ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090203054540/http://www.sexualsushi.com/thedirector.asp |date=February 3, 2009 }}</ref> In 2004, Joy filmed Sexual Sushi, her first alternative pornographic film for women. [[Harper Collins]] published her book ''How to Make Your Own Adult Video: The Couple\u2019s Guide to Making Sensual Home Movies'' in 2006. She then shot ''Female Fantasies'' and ''Feeling it, not faking it!''. In 2009, Joy established the Petra Joy Award, an international erotic film competition for first-time female directors. She runs \u201chow to make your own creative porn\u201d workshops and speaks on the subject of women and [[pornography]] across Europe. Joy curates and produces a feminist porn series called ''Her Porn'' and has shot a documentary called ''The Joy of Porn: My Life as a Feminist Pornographer''.\n\n== Erotic Film Production ==\nJoy started producing and directing erotic films in 2004 with the aim to show a more accurate reflection of female sexuality than mainstream porn filmmakers. She works exclusively with amateur performers, with the intention of capturing real chemistry, always shows safe sex, and has a policy never to show acts that can be perceived as being degrading to women. In contrast to mainstream porn that often focuses on shots of genitalia, Joy focused on the faces of the performers. Authentic sex scenes, men as sex objects, elaborate costumes, and taboo themes such as females penetrating males, and male bisexuality often feature in her films.\n\nOf her first erotic film, ''Sexual Sushi'', one reviewer wrote, \u201cPetra has achieved her aim of creating an antidote to \u2018porn junk food\u2019\u201d.<ref>[http://www.vinylla.co.uk/reviews/index.html ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100514122539/http://www.vinylla.co.uk/reviews/index.html |date=May 14, 2010 }}</ref>\n\nShe describes her inspiration as follows:\n\n\u201c\u2026 [C]ommercially successful porn does nothing for me: I want porn that stimulates the mind and feeds the soul. I want porn that is educational and inspirational. I want porn that is creative and kinky. And because I cannot find it anywhere, I make my own. I am a visual creature and enjoy expressing myself through photos and films that are very different from mainstream glamour photography and porn films.\u201d<ref name=\"sexualsushi1\"/>\n\nIn 2009, she curated and produced the first installment of the ''Her Porn'' series with the aim of showing a variety of female erotic visions. ''Her Porn 2'' is to be released in April 2010. She also acts as a distributor for other female directors.\n\nHer films have been shown at New York City\u2019s [[Cinekink]] festival, the [[pornfilmfest]] Berlin, and at the [[British Film Institute]].\n\n==The Petra Joy Award==\nThe Petra Joy Awards were founded by Petra Joy in October 2009 to encourage first-time erotic female filmmakers and to help the genre of porn from a female perspective thrive.{{citation needed|date=May 2014}} Sponsored by German personal lubricant manufacturer \"pjur\", the inaugural theme was \u201cWhat is erotic to you?\u201d.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.joyawards.com/index.asp|title=The Joy Awards 2009, Main page|last=Joy|first=Petra|year=2009|website=Joyawards.com|access-date=7 May 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090706053845/http://www.joyawards.com/index.asp|archive-date=6 July 2009}}</ref> Submissions came from [[Australia]], America, the Netherlands, [[England]], [[Spain]] and [[Austria]].{{citation needed|date=May 2014}} The winning films premiered at the Movimento cinema in [[Berlin]] during Berlin\u2019s pornfilmfest.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.joyawards.com/awards_ceremony_2009.asp|title=The Joy Awards 2009, Awards Ceremony 2009|last=Joy|first=Petra|year=2009|website=Joyawards.com|access-date=7 May 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091208033813/www.joyawards.com/awards_ceremony_2009.asp|archive-date=8 December 2009}}</ref> In addition to cash prizes, the winning films were included on the first volume of Joy\u2019s compilation of erotic female filmmakers ''Her Porn''.{{citation needed|date=May 2014}}\n\n'''2009 Winners''':<ref>{{cite web|url=http://business.avn.com/articles/36736.html|title=AVN - Winners of Inaugural Petra Joy Awards Announced|publisher=Business.avn.com|date=2009-11-09|accessdate=2014-05-29}}</ref>\n* First Prize - Louise Lush, \u201cThat\u2019s What I Like\u201d\n* Second Prize - Lola Clavo, \u201cLa Lucha\u201d\n* Third Prize - Linsey Satterthwaite, \u201cI Like It When\u201d\n* Special Jury Award - [[Cora Emens]], \u201cCora\u2019s Memoirs\u2014The Rose\u201d\n\n==Professional honours and awards==\n* 2004 [[Erotic Award]] - Photographer of the Year<ref>[http://www.erotic-awards.co.uk/2004] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090827085224/http://www.erotic-awards.co.uk/2004 |date=August 27, 2009 }}</ref>\n* 2007 [[Barcelona International Erotic Film Festival|FICEB]] Award - Best Softcore Film (''Female Fantasies'' - Strawberries Seductress)<ref>{{cite web|url=https://uk.imdb.com/Sections/Awards/Barcelona_International_Erotic_Film_Festival/2007|title=Barcelona International Erotic Film Festival (2007)|publisher=Uk.imdb.com|accessdate=2014-05-29}}</ref><ref name=FICEBAward2007>[http://www.xstarsnews.com/ninfas-awards-ficeb-1818.html \"Winners of the 2007 FICEB Ninfa Awards\"], h.b., October 10, 2007, xstarsnews.com.

His career grew as he appeared at such venues as the [[The 2i's Coffee Bar|Two I's]], in [[Soho]], and the Laconda and Safari Clubs. His repertoire consisted of early rock and roll [[Standard (music)|standard]]s and gentle [[ballad]]s.<ref name=\"Thompson\"/> Gadd gained his first break when film producer [[Robert Hartford-Davis]] discovered him and financed a recording session for [[Decca Records]]. In January 1960, at 15, under the stage name Paul Raven, he released his first [[single (music)|single]], \"Alone in the Night\".<ref name=\"timesonline.co.uk\">{{cite news |url= http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/uk/article4573311.ece |work=[[The Times]] |location=London |title= Nowhere to call home |date= 21 August 2008  | first=Valentine | last=Low | accessdate=3 May 2010}}</ref> <!-- The exact timings here need to be tightened up -->\n\nA year later, with a new manager, Vic Billings, Raven signed a new recording contract with [[Parlophone]] and worked with record producer [[George Martin]], before Martin's association with [[the Beatles]]. Martin produced two singles, \"Walk on Boy\" and \"[[Tower of Strength (Gene McDaniels song)|Tower of Strength]]\", but neither sold very well and Raven's recording career stalled. By 1964, Raven was reduced to working as an assistant, and playing the warm-up for the British music television programme ''[[Ready Steady Go!]]''. He did numerous television commercials and film auditions, and in the course of those activities met arranger and record producer [[Mike Leander]], who eventually helped revive his career. Raven even auditioned for the role of the protagonist in the film ''[[Privilege (film)|Privilege]]'' (1967), which was written and directed by [[Peter Watkins]], known for the television drama ''[[The War Game]]''.\n\n===Gary Glitter===\n[[File:Gary Glitter - TopPop 1973 3.png|thumb|Glitter in 1973, during an appearance on ''[[TopPop]]'']]\nRaven joined the Mike Leander Show Band in early 1965. He was then deputised to produce a few recording sessions by such artists as Thane Russell and a [[Scotland|Scottish]] [[freakbeat]] band, [[the Poets]]. After Leander's group disbanded, Raven formed Boston International with [[saxophonist]] John Rossall, and spent the following five years touring the UK and [[West Germany]], recording occasionally. From 1968 to 1970, several singles including \"Musical Man\", \"Goodbye Seattle\" and a cover version of the Beatles' \"[[Here Comes the Sun]]\" were released, his name briefly changed to Paul Monday. As the [[Glam rock|glam]] movement took off in 1971, Raven adopted the new stage name Gary Glitter, which he devised by playing alliteratively with letters of the alphabet, working backwards from Z. Other options included Terry Tinsel, Stanley Sparkle and Vicky Vomit.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/4766890.stm|title=Profile: Gary Glitter|publisher=BBC News|accessdate=27 September 2014}}</ref>\n\nThe song that made Gary Glitter's name began as a 15-minute [[jam session]]; whittled down to a pair of three-minute extracts it was released in 1972 as the [[A-side and B-side]]s of a single called \"[[Rock and Roll (Gary Glitter song)|Rock and Roll, Parts 1 and 2]]\". Part 2 proved to be the more popular side in many countries, although it took about six months before it made its full impact, going to No. 2 on the [[UK Singles Chart]] and reaching the Top Ten in the [[United States]], one of the few British glam rock records to do so. \"Rock and Roll Part 1\" was also a hit: in [[France]] it made number-one, and in the UK both sides were listed together on the charts.\n\n===Mainstream success===\n\"Rock and Roll\" was followed by other successes over the next three years. Glitter, backed by the [[Glittermen]]/[[the Glitter Band]] on stage, competed with [[The Sweet|Sweet]], [[Slade]] and [[T. Rex (band)|T. Rex]] for domination of the charts. To reinforce his image, he reportedly owned 30 glitter suits and fifty pairs of silver [[platform boot]]s. He also released several singles which became UK Top 10 hits, with \"[[I'm the Leader of the Gang (I Am)]]\" being his first single to reach the number-one position in the summer of 1973, and \"[[I Love You Love Me Love]]\", its follow-up, his second. Even an atypical ballad, \"[[Remember Me This Way (Gary Glitter song)|Remember Me This Way]]\", went to No. 3. He had eleven consecutive Top 10 singles, from \"Rock and Roll, Parts 1 and 2\" in 1972 to \"[[Doing Alright with the Boys]]\" in the summer of 1975.<ref name=\"UKcharts\">{{cite web | url=http://www.officialcharts.com/artist/_/gary%20glitter/ | title=UK Charts \u2013 Gary Glitter | publisher=www.officialscharts.com | accessdate=6 February 2015}}</ref> \"Rock and Roll (Part 2)\" caught on as a popular [[Stadium anthem|sports anthem]] in North America.<ref name=yahoo/>\n\nDespite his success in the UK, Glitter never made the same impact in America where, at best, glam rock was seen as a curiosity. Glitter had one more entry on the US charts with \"[[I Didn't Know I Loved You (Till I Saw You Rock and Roll)]]\"; after that, the closest chart success for Glitter was a cover recording of \"[[I'm the Leader of the Gang (I Am)]]\" by [[Brownsville Station (band)|Brownsville Station]].\n\nAfter \"Doing Alright with the Boys\", Glitter won the award for Best Male Artist at the ''Saturday Scene'' music awards hosted by [[London Weekend Television|LWT]]. His next release was a cover of [[the Rivingtons]]' novelty [[Nonsense|nonsensical]] doo-wop song \"[[Papa-Oom-Mow-Mow]]\", but it got no higher than No. 38 on the British charts.<ref name=UKcharts/> After subsequent releases stalled in similar fashion, Glitter announced his [[retirement]] from the music industry to start a family life with his new partner in early 1976. That same year, his first hits package, simply titled ''Greatest Hits'', was released. It entered the UK Top 40 best-seller charts. A similar budget album, entitled ''I Love You Love Me Love'', was issued by [[Sonar Entertainment|Hallmark Entertainment]] the following year.\n\n===Comeback and business interests===\nIn 1976, Glitter faced declining record sales. He took a two-year-long [[exile]], living in [[France]] and [[Australia]], before returning to the UK, and beginning his comeback.\n\nGlitter's career took a downturn towards the end of the 1970s, leading him to declare [[bankruptcy]] in 1977, though he later blamed the high [[tax rate]] in the UK at the time.<ref name=Russell/><ref name=feb15>{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-31111208|title=Gary Glitter: Glamour rock star to paedophile|work=BBC News|date=5 February 2015|accessdate=7 March 2015}}</ref> He entered bankruptcy a second time over unpaid tax in the 1990s. Under financial pressure, not even a pair of Top 40 hit singles (\"[[It Takes All Night Long]]\" and \"A Little Boogie Woogie in the Back of My Mind\") could lift him all the way back. It took the [[post-punk]] audience, and some of its artists who still respected Glitter's work, to do that; he had been an influence on post-punk, [[new wave music|new wave]], [[Britpop]] and [[glam metal]], as well as early [[punk rock]] itself.<ref>{{cite web | title = Punk History | publisher = The Punk Music Scene | url = http://www.caughtoffguard.co.uk/punk_history.html | quote = individuals such as Gary Glitter have all been honoured as strong influences in [[Punk rock]] evolution | accessdate = April 25, 2013 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20120314231819/http://www.caughtoffguard.co.uk/punk_history.html | archive-date = 14 March 2012 | url-status = dead | df = dmy-all }}</ref><ref>{{cite web | first = Christopher | last = Duda | title = The Vibrators \u2013 Interview with Knox | publisher = SugarBuzz Magazine | url = http://www.sugarbuzzmagazine.com/bands/vibrators/vibrators.html | quote = I liked Gary Glitter, Hello, Slade; they were all laying the roots to punk. | accessdate = April 25, 2013}}</ref> Around this time, Glitter settled into being a performer with a niche following that continued until his conviction for downloading [[child pornography]] in 1999. This helped provide the opportunity for Glitter to cut a dance medley of his greatest hits, \"All That Glitters\", which charted in 1981. Within three years, he was playing 80 shows a year at [[college]]s and [[nightclub]]s and had chart hits \"[[Dance Me Up]]\" (UK No. 25) and \"[[Another Rock and Roll Christmas]]\" (UK No. 7).<ref name=UKcharts/>\n\nGlitter's comeback was boosted in the 1980s by various guest spots and collaborations. In 1982, he appeared on the [[British Electric Foundation]] album ''Music of Quality and Distinction Volume One'' (UK No. 25) along with fellow pop/rock luminaries [[Sandie Shaw]] and [[Tina Turner]]. In 1988, [[The KLF|the Timelords]]' \"Doctoring the Tardis\", a ''[[Doctor Who]]'' tribute that sampled \"Rock and Roll (Part 2)\", reached the number-one spot. In due course, Glitter re-cut \"Rock and Roll\" with producer [[Trevor Horn]] and also \"I'm the Leader of the Gang (I Am)\" with [[Girlschool]]. In the late 1980s, his hit singles were used to compile the Telstar-released ''C'mon... C'mon \u2013 The Gary Glitter Party Album''. In 1989, [[Jive Bunny and the Mastermixers]] put a large sample of \"Another Rock and Roll Christmas\" on their number-one UK hit \"[[Let's Party (Jive Bunny and the Mastermixers song)|Let's Party]]\". In 1987 Glitter received a ten-year driving ban and narrowly escaped imprisonment after a third conviction for [[Drunk driving law by country|drunk driving]].<ref name=\"Glitter profile\"/>\n\nDuring the 1980s Glitter became a [[Buddhism|Buddhist]] and a [[Vegetarianism|vegetarian]].<ref>{{cite web | url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-30779121 | title=Profile: Gary Glitter | publisher=BBC News | accessdate=27 February 2015}}</ref> He opened a restaurant in [[Leicester Square]] in 1991, with Gary's Glitter Bar being promoted under the slogan \"Leader of the Snack\", but the restaurant closed a few years later.<ref name=\"Leaderofthesnack\">{{cite news | url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/newstopics/garyglitter/2603054/Gary-Glitter-his-personal-wealth.html | title=Gary Glitter: his personal wealth | work=The Daily Telegraph |location=London | date=22 August 2008 | accessdate=8 March 2015}}</ref><!--- \"Garry's Glitter Bar\" was, in fact a \"tiny sandwich shop\" on the corner of Leicester Square. \"It went out of business very quickly: see [http://yukioyung.blogspot.co.uk/2007/10/exhibit-7-garys-glitter-bar-leader-of.html] ---> Glitter also launched his own record label in the early 1990s, Attitude Records, after he lost his deal with [[Virgin Records]]. He had signed to Virgin after leaving [[Arista Records]] in 1984 after twelve years with the label. Attitude records was merged into Machmain Ltd later in the 1990s, a music company owned by Glitter.\n\nGlitter spent the next decade mostly as an in-demand live performer, and his back catalogue of recordings proved durable enough for several compilations to be successfully released.

That material was to have been part of a project called ''Lost on Life Street'' until that album's release was cancelled following his arrest. By December 2004, after releasing a new single, \"Control\", Glitter was in the news again concerning his behaviour; [[Non-governmental organization|NGO]]s had been petitioning the government with their own evidence aimed at arresting Glitter. He moved to Vietnam.\n\nIn 2005 ''[[Remember Me This Way (film)|Remember Me This Way]]'', the documentary filmed at Glitter's career peak in 1973 (and originally released in 1974), was issued for the first time on [[DVD]]. Glitter's music itself still had an audience, further demonstrated by three new album releases, although all of them contained past recordings from the vaults, rather than new product. The first two new albums were issued at the same time, ''The Remixes'' and ''Live in Concert'' (the latter of which was a 1981 recording). These were only for sale on the Internet.

His career grew as he appeared at such venues as the [[The 2i's Coffee Bar|Two I's]], in [[Soho]], and the Laconda and Safari Clubs. His repertoire consisted of early rock and roll [[Standard (music)|standard]]s and gentle [[ballad]]s.<ref name=\"Thompson\"/> Gadd gained his first break when film producer [[Robert Hartford-Davis]] discovered him and financed a recording session for [[Decca Records]]. In January 1960, at 15, under the stage name Paul Raven, he released his first [[single (music)|single]], \"Alone in the Night\".<ref name=\"timesonline.co.uk\">{{cite news |url= http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/uk/article4573311.ece |work=[[The Times]] |location=London |title= Nowhere to call home |date= 21 August 2008  | first=Valentine | last=Low | accessdate=3 May 2010}}</ref> <!-- The exact timings here need to be tightened up -->\n\nA year later, with a new manager, Vic Billings, Raven signed a new recording contract with [[Parlophone]] and worked with record producer [[George Martin]], before Martin's association with [[the Beatles]]. Martin produced two singles, \"Walk on Boy\" and \"[[Tower of Strength (Gene McDaniels song)|Tower of Strength]]\", but neither sold very well and Raven's recording career stalled. By 1964, Raven was reduced to working as an assistant, and playing the warm-up for the British music television programme ''[[Ready Steady Go!]]''. He did numerous television commercials and film auditions, and in the course of those activities met arranger and record producer [[Mike Leander]], who eventually helped revive his career. Raven even auditioned for the role of the protagonist in the film ''[[Privilege (film)|Privilege]]'' (1967), which was written and directed by [[Peter Watkins]], known for the television drama ''[[The War Game]]''.\n\n===Gary Glitter===\n[[File:Gary Glitter - TopPop 1973 3.png|thumb|Glitter in 1973, during an appearance on ''[[TopPop]]'']]\nRaven joined the Mike Leander Show Band in early 1965. He was then deputised to produce a few recording sessions by such artists as Thane Russell and a [[Scotland|Scottish]] [[freakbeat]] band, [[the Poets]]. After Leander's group disbanded, Raven formed Boston International with [[saxophonist]] John Rossall, and spent the following five years touring the UK and [[West Germany]], recording occasionally. From 1968 to 1970, several singles including \"Musical Man\", \"Goodbye Seattle\" and a cover version of the Beatles' \"[[Here Comes the Sun]]\" were released, his name briefly changed to Paul Monday. As the [[Glam rock|glam]] movement took off in 1971, Raven adopted the new stage name Gary Glitter, which he devised by playing alliteratively with letters of the alphabet, working backwards from Z. Other options included Terry Tinsel, Stanley Sparkle and Vicky Vomit.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/4766890.stm|title=Profile: Gary Glitter|publisher=BBC News|accessdate=27 September 2014}}</ref>\n\nThe song that made Gary Glitter's name began as a 15-minute [[jam session]]; whittled down to a pair of three-minute extracts it was released in 1972 as the [[A-side and B-side]]s of a single called \"[[Rock and Roll (Gary Glitter song)|Rock and Roll, Parts 1 and 2]]\". Part 2 proved to be the more popular side in many countries, although it took about six months before it made its full impact, going to No. 2 on the [[UK Singles Chart]] and reaching the Top Ten in the [[United States]], one of the few British glam rock records to do so. \"Rock and Roll Part 1\" was also a hit: in [[France]] it made number-one, and in the UK both sides were listed together on the charts.\n\n===Mainstream success===\n\"Rock and Roll\" was followed by other successes over the next three years. Glitter, backed by the [[Glittermen]]/[[the Glitter Band]] on stage, competed with [[The Sweet|Sweet]], [[Slade]] and [[T. Rex (band)|T. Rex]] for domination of the charts. To reinforce his image, he reportedly owned 30 glitter suits and fifty pairs of silver [[platform boot]]s. He also released several singles which became UK Top 10 hits, with \"[[I'm the Leader of the Gang (I Am)]]\" being his first single to reach the number-one position in the summer of 1973, and \"[[I Love You Love Me Love]]\", its follow-up, his second. Even an atypical ballad, \"[[Remember Me This Way (Gary Glitter song)|Remember Me This Way]]\", went to No. 3. He had eleven consecutive Top 10 singles, from \"Rock and Roll, Parts 1 and 2\" in 1972 to \"[[Doing Alright with the Boys]]\" in the summer of 1975.<ref name=\"UKcharts\">{{cite web | url=http://www.officialcharts.com/artist/_/gary%20glitter/ | title=UK Charts \u2013 Gary Glitter | publisher=www.officialscharts.com | accessdate=6 February 2015}}</ref> \"Rock and Roll (Part 2)\" caught on as a popular [[Stadium anthem|sports anthem]] in North America.<ref name=yahoo/>\n\nDespite his success in the UK, Glitter never made the same impact in America where, at best, glam rock was seen as a curiosity. Glitter had one more entry on the US charts with \"[[I Didn't Know I Loved You (Till I Saw You Rock and Roll)]]\"; after that, the closest chart success for Glitter was a cover recording of \"[[I'm the Leader of the Gang (I Am)]]\" by [[Brownsville Station (band)|Brownsville Station]].\n\nAfter \"Doing Alright with the Boys\", Glitter won the award for Best Male Artist at the ''Saturday Scene'' music awards hosted by [[London Weekend Television|LWT]]. His next release was a cover of [[the Rivingtons]]' novelty [[Nonsense|nonsensical]] doo-wop song \"[[Papa-Oom-Mow-Mow]]\", but it got no higher than No. 38 on the British charts.<ref name=UKcharts/> After subsequent releases stalled in similar fashion, Glitter announced his [[retirement]] from the music industry to start a family life with his new partner in early 1976. That same year, his first hits package, simply titled ''Greatest Hits'', was released. It entered the UK Top 40 best-seller charts. A similar budget album, entitled ''I Love You Love Me Love'', was issued by [[Sonar Entertainment|Hallmark Entertainment]] the following year.\n\n===Comeback and business interests===\nIn 1976, Glitter faced declining record sales. He took a two-year-long [[exile]], living in [[France]] and [[Australia]], before returning to the UK, and beginning his comeback.\n\nGlitter's career took a downturn towards the end of the 1970s, leading him to declare [[bankruptcy]] in 1977, though he later blamed the high [[tax rate]] in the UK at the time.<ref name=Russell/><ref name=feb15>{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-31111208|title=Gary Glitter: Glamour rock star to paedophile|work=BBC News|date=5 February 2015|accessdate=7 March 2015}}</ref> He entered bankruptcy a second time over unpaid tax in the 1990s. Under financial pressure, not even a pair of Top 40 hit singles (\"[[It Takes All Night Long]]\" and \"A Little Boogie Woogie in the Back of My Mind\") could lift him all the way back. It took the [[post-punk]] audience, and some of its artists who still respected Glitter's work, to do that; he had been an influence on post-punk, [[new wave music|new wave]], [[Britpop]] and [[glam metal]], as well as early [[punk rock]] itself.<ref>{{cite web | title = Punk History | publisher = The Punk Music Scene | url = http://www.caughtoffguard.co.uk/punk_history.html | quote = individuals such as Gary Glitter have all been honoured as strong influences in [[Punk rock]] evolution | accessdate = April 25, 2013 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20120314231819/http://www.caughtoffguard.co.uk/punk_history.html | archive-date = 14 March 2012 | url-status = dead | df = dmy-all }}</ref><ref>{{cite web | first = Christopher | last = Duda | title = The Vibrators \u2013 Interview with Knox | publisher = SugarBuzz Magazine | url = http://www.sugarbuzzmagazine.com/bands/vibrators/vibrators.html | quote = I liked Gary Glitter, Hello, Slade; they were all laying the roots to punk. | accessdate = April 25, 2013}}</ref> Around this time, Glitter settled into being a performer with a niche following that continued until his conviction for downloading [[child pornography]] in 1999. This helped provide the opportunity for Glitter to cut a dance medley of his greatest hits, \"All That Glitters\", which charted in 1981. Within three years, he was playing 80 shows a year at [[college]]s and [[nightclub]]s and had chart hits \"[[Dance Me Up]]\" (UK No. 25) and \"[[Another Rock and Roll Christmas]]\" (UK No. 7).<ref name=UKcharts/>\n\nGlitter's comeback was boosted in the 1980s by various guest spots and collaborations. In 1982, he appeared on the [[British Electric Foundation]] album ''Music of Quality and Distinction Volume One'' (UK No. 25) along with fellow pop/rock luminaries [[Sandie Shaw]] and [[Tina Turner]]. In 1988, [[The KLF|the Timelords]]' \"Doctoring the Tardis\", a ''[[Doctor Who]]'' tribute that sampled \"Rock and Roll (Part 2)\", reached the number-one spot. In due course, Glitter re-cut \"Rock and Roll\" with producer [[Trevor Horn]] and also \"I'm the Leader of the Gang (I Am)\" with [[Girlschool]]. In the late 1980s, his hit singles were used to compile the Telstar-released ''C'mon... C'mon \u2013 The Gary Glitter Party Album''. In 1989, [[Jive Bunny and the Mastermixers]] put a large sample of \"Another Rock and Roll Christmas\" on their number-one UK hit \"[[Let's Party (Jive Bunny and the Mastermixers song)|Let's Party]]\". In 1987 Glitter received a ten-year driving ban and narrowly escaped imprisonment after a third conviction for [[Drunk driving law by country|drunk driving]].<ref name=\"Glitter profile\"/>\n\nDuring the 1980s Glitter became a [[Buddhism|Buddhist]] and a [[Vegetarianism|vegetarian]].<ref>{{cite web | url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-30779121 | title=Profile: Gary Glitter | publisher=BBC News | accessdate=27 February 2015}}</ref> He opened a restaurant in [[Leicester Square]] in 1991, with Gary's Glitter Bar being promoted under the slogan \"Leader of the Snack\", but the restaurant closed a few years later.<ref name=\"Leaderofthesnack\">{{cite news | url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/newstopics/garyglitter/2603054/Gary-Glitter-his-personal-wealth.html | title=Gary Glitter: his personal wealth | work=The Daily Telegraph |location=London | date=22 August 2008 | accessdate=8 March 2015}}</ref><!--- \"Garry's Glitter Bar\" was, in fact a \"tiny sandwich shop\" on the corner of Leicester Square. \"It went out of business very quickly: see [http://yukioyung.blogspot.co.uk/2007/10/exhibit-7-garys-glitter-bar-leader-of.html] ---> Glitter also launched his own record label in the early 1990s, Attitude Records, after he lost his deal with [[Virgin Records]]. He had signed to Virgin after leaving [[Arista Records]] in 1984 after twelve years with the label. Attitude records was merged into Machmain Ltd later in the 1990s, a music company owned by Glitter.\n\nGlitter spent the next decade mostly as an in-demand live performer, and his back catalogue of recordings proved durable enough for several compilations to be successfully released. He appeared in billboard and poster advertisements for [[British Rail]], in one of which he was shown attempting to look younger in order to obtain a [[16\u201325 Railcard|Young Persons Railcard]].<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.advertisingarchives.co.uk/detail/39611/1/Magazine-Advert/Young-Persons-Railcard/1990s | title=Young Persons Railcard | publisher=www.advertisingarchives.co.uk | accessdate=28 January 2015}}</ref> He also released a new studio album ''[[Leader II]]'' in 1991.\n\n''The Leader'', his best-selling [[autobiography]], was published in 1991.<ref name=\"leader\">{{cite web | url=http://www.billboard.com/artist/302611/gary-glitter/biography | title=Gary Glitter \u2013 Biography | publisher=www.billboard.com | accessdate=9 March 2015}}</ref> He was a surprise hit at the [[1994 FIFA World Cup]] concert in Chicago, which was telecast live to forty-six countries.<ref name=leader/> He played the Godfather in the 1996 [[The Who Tour 1996\u20131997|revival tour]] of [[the Who]]'s ''[[Quadrophenia]]''.<ref name=\"Talevski2010\">{{cite book|author=Nick Talevski|title=Rock Obituaries \u2013 Knocking On Heaven's Door|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=DykffzkFALoC&pg=PA158|date=7 April 2010|publisher=Omnibus|isbn=978-0-85712-117-2|pages=158\u2013}}</ref> He also released a new single, a cover version of \"[[The House of the Rising Sun]]\".

That material was to have been part of a project called ''Lost on Life Street'' until that album's release was cancelled following his arrest. By December 2004, after releasing a new single, \"Control\", Glitter was in the news again concerning his behaviour; [[Non-governmental organization|NGO]]s had been petitioning the government with their own evidence aimed at arresting Glitter. He moved to Vietnam.\n\nIn 2005 ''[[Remember Me This Way (film)|Remember Me This Way]]'', the documentary filmed at Glitter's career peak in 1973 (and originally released in 1974), was issued for the first time on [[DVD]]. Glitter's music itself still had an audience, further demonstrated by three new album releases, although all of them contained past recordings from the vaults, rather than new product. The first two new albums were issued at the same time, ''The Remixes'' and ''Live in Concert'' (the latter of which was a 1981 recording). These were only for sale on the Internet. A new collection of Glitter's chart hit singles followed, ''The Best of Gary Glitter''.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.vh1.com/artists/az/glitter_gary/958559/album.jhtml |title= Gary Glitter Album Download|publisher=[[VH1]]}}</ref> In 2006 his back catalogue was made available via the Internet from sites such as [[iTunes Store|iTunes]] and [[eMusic]].\n\nIn 2011 a collection of hits and B-sides was issued under the title ''All that Glitters''.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.amazon.co.uk/All-That-Glitters-Best-Glitter/dp/B005PYFQ14/ref=sr_1_8?ie=UTF8&qid=1350605736&sr=8-8 |title=All That Glitters \u2013 The Best Of Gary Glitter: Amazon.co.uk: Music |publisher=Amazon.co.uk |accessdate=11 November 2012}}</ref>\n\nNews reports stated that, as of late July 2013, Glitter may have earned a total of \u00a31,000,000 from royalties derived from the Oasis song \"Hello\" that sampled \"Hello, Hello, I'm Back Again\".

He was educated at [[Mill Hill School]] and [[New College, Oxford]] where he read history. While at Oxford Dodds was editor of [[Isis magazine]] and was narrowly defeated for the presidency of the [[Oxford Union|Union]]. After graduating he worked briefly for [[Herbert Samuel, 1st Viscount Samuel|Herbert Samuel]] as his private secretary and tutor to Samuel's sons. He then went to [[Jamaica]] and taught at [[Calabar High School]]. He returned to England intending to read for the [[barrister|bar]] but was drawn instead to journalism accepting the post of leader writer and literary assistant on the [[Huddersfield Daily Examiner|Huddersfield Examiner]] in 1914. He maintained his connection with the Huddersfield Examiner for sixty years, as editor from 1924 to 1959 and Consulting Editor after that.<ref>Egan, M., \"Elliott Dodds\", in D. Brack & E. Randall, eds., ''Dictionary of Liberal Thought'' ([[North Yorkshire]]: [[Methuen Publishing|Methuen]], 2007).</ref> During the First World War, Dodds lived in London editing the War Pictorial, a government publication designed to bolster civilian morale.<ref>George Smith, ''The Cornhill Magazine'', Smith, Elder & Co, 1975, p.596.</ref>\n\n==Politics and liberalism==\nIn 1920 Dodds wrote his first book, ''Is Liberalism Dead''? As far as Dodds\u2019 efforts to enter Parliament were concerned, it seemed it was. He tried without success at [[City of York (UK Parliament constituency)|York]] in [[1922 United Kingdom general election|1922]] and [[1923 United Kingdom general election|1923]], at [[Halifax (UK Parliament constituency)|Halifax]] in [[1929 United Kingdom general election|1929]] and at [[Rochdale (UK Parliament constituency)|Rochdale]] in [[1931 United Kingdom general election|1931]] and [[1935 United Kingdom general election|1935]]. At Rochdale in 1931, Dodds stood in support of the National Government but because of his views on free trade and opposition to tariffs the Conservatives decided to put up their own National candidate thus splitting the anti-Labour vote.<ref>The Times, 19.19.31</ref> Un-discouraged by his defeats, he continued to play a role in the [[National League of Young Liberals]] of which he was president from 1932 to 1937<ref>The Times, 17.3.33, 21.3.35 & 29.3.37</ref> and to write about Liberalism publishing ''Liberalism in Action'' in 1922 and ''The Social Gospel of Liberalism'' in 1926.<ref>Mark Egan: ''Elliott Dodds'' in ''Dictionary of Liberal Biography'', Brack et al. (eds.), ''Politico''\u2019s 1998, p.97</ref>\n\nDodds\u2019 Liberalism was in the classical liberal tradition, unsympathetic to excessive state intervention in the economy and it put him in broad opposition to the [[Keynsian economics|social and industrial policies]] which the party took up in the 1920s and 1930s in response to the depression and mass unemployment. However he was clever and tribal enough to recognise the electoral value of such policies and politically nimble enough to reconcile it with his own position by placing it in the several strands of liberal thought around which the party needed to coalesce. As Wilson points out, there was a choice for radicals and traditionalists in the party. They could withdraw from politics, they could defect to other parties or they could \"allow distrust of Lloyd George to be outweighed by sympathy for the new thought and daring programme he was offering\".<ref>Trevor Wilson, ''The Downfall of the Liberal Party 1914\u20131935''; Cornell University Press, 1966, p.340</ref> In 1938 Dodds chaired the party's \u2018Ownership for All\u2019 Committee. Its resulting report reiterated the traditional Liberal position on the role of property ownership as the \u2018bedrock of liberty\u2019. The report called for restoration of free trade, reforms of the rating system, and came out against state intervention in the economy except in the most extreme of circumstances. More positively it also promoted co-ownership in industry \u2013 a policy with which Dodds became increasingly associated.<ref>Peter Barberis, ''Liberal Lion, Jo Grimond: A Political Life''; I B Tauris, 2005, p.54</ref> The report was endorsed by the 1938 [[Liberal Assembly]] but was a cause of tension and dispute between the left and right of the party for years.<ref>Robert Ingham: ''Elliott Dodds'' in ''Dictionary of Liberal Thought'' Brack & Randall (eds.) Politico\u2019s, 2007 p 93ff</ref>\n\nHowever Dodds was not one of those Liberals like [[Arthur Seldon]], [[Oliver Smedley]], [[Alfred Suenson-Taylor, 1st Baron Grantchester]] or [[S. W. Alexander]] who openly campaigned to build high the edifice of Gladstonian liberalism in the party to ward off the rising floodwater of [[William Beveridge]] and [[John Maynard Keynes]] and who drifted away from mainstream party thinking to the right, into influential think-tanks like the [[Institute of Economic Affairs]] or organisations such as the [[Society for Individual Freedom]] between the 1930s and 1960s. Dodds welcomed the [[Beveridge Report]] and maintained links with the radical wing of the party. In 1953 he became chairman of the Unservile State Group, which aimed to explore the attitudes and policies of British Liberalism for the first time since the publication of the ''[[Liberal Yellow Book]]'' in 1928. It did not seek to promote any particular Liberal brand or establish any new path for the Liberalism but disseminate ideas which were distinctly liberal, reflecting the rich variety of the liberal tradition.<ref>Peter Barberis, ''The Unservile State Group'' in Brack & Randall (eds.) ''The Dictionary of Liberal Thought'' Politico's, 2007</ref> In 1957 Dodds wrote in the opening chapter of the book ''The Unservile State: Essays in Liberty and Welfare'' that he looked forward to the Liberals \u2018re-establish[ing] themselves in their natural position as the acknowledged leaders of the Left...\u2019.<ref>[[George G.

Simmonds (John Hurt) travels to the island mansion of his married lover Mrs. Santander (Jenny Runacre). Upon arriving, however, the evasive butler (Graham Crowden) tells him that Mrs. Santander will not see him immediately, and while waiting he encounters an \"electrician\" (Charles Gray) who eventually reveals his true identity: Mr. Santander, the [[Cuckold|cuckholded]] husband of Simmonds' lover, who Simmonds had believed to be in [[South America]]. Santander invites Simmonds to a drink, where he rants at him that his wife had many other lovers before revealing Mrs. Santander's lifeless body. Simmonds, attempting to leave, notices that his [[revolver]] is missing a bullet, and suspects that Santander used it to murder his wife while Simmonds bathed. As he searches the house for the murderous husband, the butler informs him that the police are on their way. When he demands to know where Santander is, the butler replies, \"Mr. Santander, sir? Why, he's in South America,\" implying the two have conspired to [[Frameup|frame]] Simmonds for the murder. \n\n==Cast (by segment)==\n{{Col-begin|width=75%}}\n{{Col-3}}\n''Mrs. Amworth''\n*[[Glynis Johns]] as Mrs. Amworth\n*[[John Phillips (actor)|John Phillips]]as Urcombe \n*Derek Francis as Benson\n*Pip Miller as David\n{{Col-3}}\n''The Mannikin''\n*[[Ronee Blakley]] as Simone\n*[[Keir Dullea]] as David\n*Pol Pelletier as Miss Smith\n*[[Cec Linder]] as Dr. Carstairs\n{{Col-3}}\n''The Island''\n*[[John Hurt]] as Lt.
