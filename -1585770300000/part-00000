It features the group's concert at the [[MGM Grand Las Vegas|MGM Grand]] in [[Las Vegas Strip|Las Vegas]] in 1997 and includes many of their greatest hits.\n\nThe [[CD]] is edited, with some songs omitted, though the DVD version of the concert is complete. The album was reissued in 1999, and included a bonus CD with the missing songs. The CD and DVD cover features the band replicating their iconic ''[[Saturday Night Fever: The Original Movie Sound Track|Saturday Night Fever]]'' pose. The concert was re-released on [[SD Blu-ray]] by [[Eagle Rock Entertainment]] in 2013. The re-release provides superior audio quality than what is possible on DVD, but video is only marginally improved (the standard-definition video is now up-scaled to 1080i).\n\nThe Bee Gees performed songs from every decade from the 1960s to the '90s. They also sang a tribute song to their late brother [[Andy Gibb]], \"[[(Our Love) Don't Throw It All Away]]\". During this song old footage of Andy is shown, including him singing the second verse of the song. The vocals from the original recording also play during that section. [[Celine Dion|C\u00e9line Dion]] guest-starred on the Bee Gees-penned \"[[Immortality (Celine Dion song)|Immortality]]\". Recorded vocals by [[Frankie Valli]] are featured during \"[[Grease (song)|Grease]]\", and are also taken from the original song.\n\nThe album's title was originally meant to reflect the band's plan that the Las Vegas concert would be their final live performance ever. [[Barry Gibb]]'s arthritis had worsened to the point where it seemed it would be impossible for him to continue playing, but he wanted to expand the tour and so they played several more shows.\n\n{{Album reviews\n|rev1 = [[Allmusic]]\n|rev1score = {{Rating|3|5}} [{{Allmusic|class=album|id=r380476|pure_url=yes}} link]\n|rev2 = [[Muzykalnaya Gazeta]]\n|rev2score = positive<ref>{{Cite journal|last=\u0411\u0430\u0440\u0430\u043d\u043e\u0432\u0441\u043a\u0438\u0439|first=\u0410.|date=|year=1998|title=Bee Gees :: One Night Only|url=http://www.nestor.minsk.by/mg/1998/43/mg84322.html|url-status=live|journal=[[Muzykalnaya Gazeta]]|language=ru|volume=|issue=43|pages=|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20200401193724/http://www.nestor.minsk.by/mg/1998/43/mg84322.html|archivedate=2020-04-01|accessdate=2020-04-01|via=}}</ref> \n}}\n\n==Track listing==\nAll songs by [[Barry Gibb|Barry]], [[Robin Gibb|Robin]] and [[Maurice Gibb]], except where noted.\n\n#\"Intro: [[You Should Be Dancing]]/[[Alone (Bee Gees song)|Alone]]\" \u2013 5:47\n#\"[[Massachusetts (Bee Gees song)|Massachusetts]]\" \u2013 2:32\n#\"[[To Love Somebody (song)|To Love Somebody]]\" (B.

It was adapted by John Knowles and Fred Segal (brother of actor [[George Segal]]), from the former's best-selling [[A Separate Peace|novel of the same name]]. It stars [[Parker Stevenson]].\n\n==Plot==\nDuring the summer of 1942, sixteen-year-old Gene Forrester attends Devon School, a private New England Academy.  His roommate is Phineas (nicknamed \"Finny\"), a free-spirited and cheerful nonconformist who is loved by everyone he meets.  Gene, an introvert, tries to stifle his growing  jealousy but is unable to control his envy of Finny\u2019s athletic skill, natural popularity, and above all his innate goodness.\n\nUnable to bear the knowledge that Finny is a better person, Gene apparently shakes a tree branch that Finny is standing on. Finny falls to the ground and breaks his leg, permanently disabling him. After the incident, Gene meets with Finny and attempts to confess, but he then realizes that Finny desperately needs the illusion of friendship, and that he must boost his fallen friend\u2019s self-confidence.\n\nFinny returns for the winter semester, refuses to accept the wartime influences permeating Devon and, though his own athletic career is finished, he commences to train Gene for the Olympics. Finny is initially resistant to the fact that a war is raging around them until another student, \"Leper\" Lepelier, returns AWOL and corroborates the horrible stories that up until then have not been informed by first-person narrative.\n\nAnother student, the judicious-minded Brinker Hadley, instigates an inquiry into Finny\u2019s accident and convenes a kangaroo court of fellow students. During this hearing, Leper reveals the truth about what happened, as he had been looking up from under the tree when Gene apparently shook the branch. Finny begins to cry and in his effort to escape the tribunal, he falls down the stairs and breaks the same leg.\n\nThis second disaster has a curious healing effect on both boys, and when Gene visits Finny in the infirmary, the two are reconciled. Finny accepts the fact that Gene never meant to hurt him, and Gene reveals his belief that Finny would have been emotionally unfit for war, anyway. During a second procedure on his leg, bone marrow enters Finny's bloodstream and travels to his heart, killing him. The surgeon tells a shell-shocked Gene \"there are risks, always risks\" and the surviving boy realizes a part of him has died with his best friend.\n\n==Cast==\n*John Heyl as Finny\n*[[Parker Stevenson]] as Gene\n*[[William Roerick]] as Mr. Patchwithers\n*Peter Brush as Leper\n*Victor Bevine as Brinker\n*Scott Bradbury as Chet\n*John E.A.

So SDT emphasises humans' natural growth toward positive motivation; however, this is thwarted if their basic needs are not fulfilled.\n\n===Needs===\nSDT supports three basic psychological needs that must be satisfied to foster well-being and health. These needs can be universally applied. However, some may be more salient than others at certain times and are expressed differently based on time, culture, or experience.\n\n;'''Competence''' :Seek to control the outcome and experience mastery.<ref name=\"White, R.

L. 2004\" /> note this does not mean to be independent of others.\n\n===Motivations===\nSDT claims to give a different approach to motivation, considering what motivates a person at any given time as opposed to seeing motivation as a unitary concept. SDT makes distinctions between different types of motivation and the consequences of them.\n\n====Intrinsic motivation====\n[[Intrinsic motivation]] is the natural, inherent drive to seek out challenges and new possibilities that SDT associates with cognitive and social development.\n\n''[[Cognitive evaluation theory]]'' (CET)<ref name=\"Deci, E. L. 1985\">Deci, E. L., & Ryan, R. M. (1985). ''Intrinsic motivation and self-determination in human behaviour''. New York: Plenum.</ref> is a sub-theory of SDT that specifies factors explaining intrinsic motivation and variability with it and looks at how social and environmental factors help or hinder intrinsic motivations.\nCET focuses on the needs of competence and autonomy. CET is offered as an explanation of the phenomenon known as [[Motivation crowding theory|motivational \"crowding out.\"]]\n\nClaiming social context events like feedback on work or rewards lead to feelings of competence and so enhance intrinsic motivations. Deci<ref name=\"Deci, E. L. 1975\" /> found positive feedback enhanced intrinsic motivations and negative feedback diminished it. Vallerand and Reid<ref name=\"Vallerand, R.

For this to happen there must be immediate contextual support for both needs or inner resources based on prior development support for both needs.<ref name=\"Reeve, J. 1996\">Reeve, J. (1996). ''Motivating others''. Needham Heights, MA: Allyn & Bacon.</ref>\n\nCET and intrinsic motivation is also linked to relatedness through the hypothesis that intrinsic motivation flourishes if linked with a sense of security and relatedness.

Deci and Ryan<ref name=\"Deci, E. L. 1985\" /> developed organismic integration theory (OIT), as a sub-theory of SDT, to explain the different ways extrinsically motivated behaviour is regulated.\n\nOIT details the different forms of extrinsic motivation and the contexts in which they come about. It is the context of such motivation that concerns the SDT theory as these contexts affect whether the motivations are internalised and so integrated into the sense of self.\n\nOIT describes four different types of extrinsic motivations that often vary in terms of their relative autonomy:\n\n# '''Externally regulated behaviour''': Is the least autonomous, it is performed because of external demand or possible reward. Such actions can be seen to have an externally perceived [[locus of control]].<ref name=\"deCharms, R. 1968\"/>\n# '''Introjected regulation of behaviour''': describes taking on regulations to behaviour but not fully accepting said regulations as your own. Deci and Ryan<ref name=\"Deci, E. L. 1995\">Deci, E. L., & Ryan, R. M. (1995). Human autonomy: The basis for true self-esteem. In M. Kemis (Ed.), ''Efficacy, agency, and self-esteem'' (pp.&nbsp;31&ndash;49).

While this is internally driven, introjected behavior has an external perceived locus of causality or not coming from one's self.  Since the causality of the behavior is perceived as external, the behavior is considered non-self-determined.\n# '''Regulation through identification''': a more autonomously driven form of extrinsic motivation. It involves consciously valuing a goal or regulation so that said action is accepted as personally important.\n# '''Integrated Regulation''': Is the most autonomous kind of extrinsic motivation.  Occurring when regulations are fully assimilated with self so they are included in a person's self evaluations and beliefs on personal needs.  Because of this, integrated motivations share qualities with intrinsic motivation but are still classified as extrinsic because the goals that are trying to be achieved are for reasons extrinsic to the self, rather than the inherent enjoyment or interest in the task.\n\nExtrinsically motivated behaviours can be integrated into self.  OIT proposes internalization is more likely to occur when there is a sense of relatedness.\n\nRyan, Stiller and Lynch<ref name=\"Ryan, R. M. 1994\">{{cite journal | last1 = Ryan | first1 = R.

Initially intrinsically motivated behaviour becomes controlled by external rewards, which undermines their autonomy.\n\nFurther research by Amabile, DeJong and Lepper<ref name=\"Amabile, T.

Studies looking at choice have found that increasing a participant's options and choices increases their intrinsic motivation.<ref name=\"Zuckerman, M. 1978\">{{cite journal | last1 = Zuckerman | first1 = M. | last2 = Porac | first2 = J. | last3 = Lathin | first3 = D. | last4 = Smith | first4 = R. | last5 = Deci | first5 = E.

L. 1971\" /> found that giving people unexpected positive feedback on a task increases people's intrinsic motivation to do it, meaning that this was because the positive feedback was fulfilling people's need for competence. In fact, giving positive feedback on a task served only to increase people's intrinsic motivation and decreased extrinsic motivation for the task.\n\nVallerand and Reid<ref name=\"Vallerand, R. J. 1984\" /> found negative feedback has the opposite effect (i.e., decreasing intrinsic motivation by taking away from people's need for competence).\n\n===Relatedness===\nDuring a study on the relationship between infants' attachment styles, their exhibition of mastery-oriented behaviour, and their affect during play, Frodi, Bridges and Grolnick<ref name=\"Frodi, A. 1985\">{{cite journal | last1 = Frodi | first1 = A. | last2 = Bridges | first2 = L. | last3 = Grolnick | first3 = W.

Obviously, replications of all the attachment-motivation relations are needed with different and larger samples.\"\n\n==Individual differences==\nSDT argues that needs are innate but can be developed in a social context. Some people develop stronger needs than others, creating individual differences. However, individual differences within the theory focus on concepts resulting from the degree to which needs have been satisfied or not satisfied.\n\nWithin SDT there are two general individual difference concepts, Causality Orientations and Life Goals.\n\n===Causality orientations===\nCausality orientations are motivational orientations that refer either to the way people orient to an environment and regulate their behaviour because of this, or to the extent to which they are self determined in general across many settings. SDT created three orientations: autonomous, controlled and impersonal.\n\n# '''Autonomous Orientations''': result from satisfaction of the basic needs\n# '''Strong controlled orientations''': Result from satisfaction of competence and relatedness needs but not of autonomy and is linked to regulation through internal and external contingencies, which lead to rigid functioning and diminished well being.\n# '''Impersonal Orientations''': Results from failing to fulfill all three needs.  This is also related to poor functioning and ill being.\n\nAccording to the theory, people have a certain amount of each of the orientations, which can be used to make predictions on a person's psychological health and behavioural outcomes.\n\n===Life goals===\nLife goals are long-term goals people use to guide their activities, and they fall into two categories:<ref name=\"Kasser, T. 1993\">{{cite journal | last1 = Kasser | first1 = T. | last2 = Ryan | first2 = R.

L. 1971\" /> investigated the effects of external rewards on intrinsic motivation in two laboratory and one field experiment. Based on the results from earlier animal and human studies regarding intrinsic motivation the author explored two possibilities. In the first two experiments he looked at the effect of extrinsic rewards in terms of a decrease in intrinsic motivation to perform a task. Earlier studies showed contradictory or inconclusive findings regarding decrease in performance on a task following an external reward. The third experiment was based on findings of developmental learning theorists and looked at whether a different type of reward enhances intrinsic motivation to participate in an activity.\n\n====Experiment I====\nThis experiment tested the hypothesis that if an individual is intrinsically motivated to perform an activity, introduction of an extrinsic reward decreases the degree of intrinsic motivation to perform the task.\n\nTwenty-four undergraduate psychology students participated in the first laboratory experiment and were assigned to experimental (''n'' = 12) and control group (''n'' = 12). Each group participated in three sessions conducted on three different days. During the sessions, participants were engaged in working on a [[Soma cube]] puzzle\u2014which the experimenters assumed was an activity college students would be intrinsically motivated to do. The puzzle could be put together to form numerous different configurations. In each session, the participants were shown four different configurations drawn on a piece of paper and were asked to use the puzzle to reproduce the configurations while they were being timed.\n\nThe first and third session of the experimental condition were identical to control, but in the second session the participants in the experimental condition were given a dollar for completing each puzzle within time. During the middle of each session, the experimenter left the room for eight minutes and the participants were told that they were free to do whatever they wanted during that time, while the experimenter observed during that period. The amount of time spent working on the puzzle during the free choice period was used to measure motivation.\n\nAs Deci expected, when external reward was introduced during session two, the participants spent more time working on the puzzles during the free choice period in comparison to session 1 and when the external reward was removed in the third session, the time spent working on the puzzle dropped lower than the first session. All subjects reported finding the task interesting and enjoyable at the end of each session, providing evidence for the experimenter's assumption that the task was intrinsically motivating for the college students. The study showed some support of the experimenter's hypothesis and a trend towards decrease in intrinsic motivation was seen after money was provided to the participants as external reward.\n\n====Experiment II====\nThe second experiment was a field experiment, similar to laboratory Experiment I, but was conducted in a natural setting.\n\nEight student workers were observed at a college biweekly newspaper. Four of the students served as a control group and worked on Friday. The experimental group worked on Tuesdays.\n\nThe control and experimental group students were not aware that they were being observed. The 10-week observation was divided into three time periods. The task in this study required the students to write headlines for the newspaper.\n\nDuring \"Time 2\", the students in the experimental group were given 50 cents for each headline they wrote. At the end of Time 2, they were told that in the future the newspaper cannot pay them 50 cent for each headline anymore as the newspaper ran out of the money allocated for that and they were not paid for the headlines during Time 3.\n\nThe speed of task completion (headlines) was used as a measure of motivation in this experiment. Absences were used as a measure of attitudes.\n\nTo assess the stability of the observed effect, the experimenter observed the students again (Time 4) for two weeks. There was a gap of five weeks between Time 3 and Time 4. Due to absences and change in assignment etc., motivation data was not available for all students. The results of this experiment were similar to Experiment I and monetary reward was found to decrease the intrinsic motivation of the students, supporting Deci's hypothesis.\n\n====Experiment III====\nExperiment III was also conducted in the laboratory and was identical to Experiment I in all respects except for the kind of external reward provided to the students in experimental condition during Session 2.\n\nIn this experiment, verbal praise was used as an extrinsic reward.\n\nThe experimenter hypothesized that a different type of reward\u2014i.e., social approval in the form of verbal reinforcement and positive feedback for performing the task that a person is intrinsically motivated to perform\u2014enhances the degree of external motivation, even after the extrinsic reward is removed.\n\nThe results of the experiment III confirmed the hypothesis and the students' performance increased significantly during the third session in comparison to session one, showing that verbal praise and positive feedback enhances performance in tasks that a person is initially intrinsically motivated to perform. This provides evidence that verbal praise as external reward increases intrinsic motivation.\n\nThe author explained differences between the two types of external rewards as having different effects on intrinsic motivation. When a person is intrinsically motivated to perform a task and money is introduced to work on the task, the individual cognitively re-evaluates the importance of the task and the intrinsic motivation to perform the task (because the individual finds it interesting) shifts to extrinsic motivation and the primary focus changes from enjoying the task to gaining financial reward.  However, when verbal praise is provided in a similar situation increases intrinsic motivation as it is not evaluated to be controlled by external factors and the person sees the task as an enjoyable task that is performed autonomously.  The increase in intrinsic motivation is explained by [[positive reinforcement]] and an increase in perceived locus of control to perform the task.\n\n===Pritchard, Campbell and Campbell (1977): Evaluation of Deci's Hypothesis===\nPritchard, Campbell and Campbell<ref name=\"Pritchard, R. 1977\">{{cite journal | last1 = Pritchard | first1 = R. | last2 = Campbell | first2 = K. | last3 = Campbell | first3 = D. | year = 1977 | title = Effects of extrinsic financial rewards on intrinsic motivation | url = | journal = Journal of Applied Psychology | volume = 62 | issue = | pages = 9\u201315 | doi=10.1037/0021-9010.62.1.9}}</ref> conducted a similar study to evaluate Deci's hypothesis regarding the role of extrinsic rewards on decreasing intrinsic motivation.\n\nParticipants were randomly assigned to two groups. A chess-problem task was used in this study. Data was collected in two sessions.\n\n====Session I====\nParticipants were asked to complete a background questionnaire that included questions on the amount of time the participant played chess during the week, the number of years that the participant has been playing chess for, amount of enjoyment the participant gets from playing the game, etc.\n\nThe participants in both groups were then told that the experimenter needed to enter the information in the computer and for the next 10 minutes the participant were free to do whatever they liked.\n\nThe experimenter left the room for 10 minutes. The room had similar chess-problem tasks on the table, some magazines as well as coffee was made available for the participants if they chose to have it.\n\nThe time spent on the chess-problem task was observed through a one way mirror by the experimenter during the 10 minutes break and was used as a measure of intrinsic motivation. After the experimenter returned, the experimental group was told that there was a monetary reward for the participant who could work on the most chess problems in the given time and that the reward is for this session only and would not be offered during the next session. The control group was not offered a monetary reward.\n\n====Session II====\nThe second session was the same for the two groups:\n\nAfter a filler task, the experimenter left the room for 10 minutes and the time participants spent on the chess-problem task was observed. The experimental group was reminded that there was no reward for the task this time.\n\nAfter both sessions the participants were required to respond to questionnaires evaluating the task, i.e. to what degree did they find the task interesting. Both groups reported that they found the task interesting.\n\nThe results of the study showed that the experimental group showed a significant decrease in time spent on the chess-problem task during the 10-minute free time from session 1 to session 2 in comparison to the group that was not paid, thus confirming the hypothesis presented by Deci that contingent monetary reward for an activity decreases the intrinsic motivation to perform that activity. Other studies were conducted around this time focusing on other types of rewards as well as other external factors that play a role in decreasing intrinsic motivation.<ref name=\"eg Amabile, T.

Specifically, the researchers looked at the effect of motivational climate generated by peers on exercisers by analyzing data collected through questionnaires and rating scales. The assessment included evaluation of motivational climate, basic psychological needs satisfaction, levels of self-determination and self-regulation (amotivation, external, introjected, identified and intrinsic regulation) and also the assessment of the level of satisfaction and enjoyment in exercising.\n\nData analysis revealed that when peers are supportive and there is an emphasis on cooperation, effort, and personal improvement, the climate influences variables like basic psychological needs, motivation and enjoyment. The task climate positively predicted the three basic psychological needs (competence, autonomy and relatedness) and so positively predicted self-determined motivation. Task climate and the resulting self-determination were also found to positively influence level of enjoyment the exercisers experienced during the activity.\n\nBehzadniaa, Adachi, Deci, and Mohammadzadeh<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite journal|last=Behzadnia|first=B.|last2=Adachi|first2=P.J.C.|last3=Deci|first3=E.L.|last4=Mohammadzadeh|first4=H.|date=2018-11-01|title=Associations between students' perceptions of physical education teachers' interpersonal styles and students' wellness, knowledge, performance, and intentions to persist at physical activity: A self-determination theory approach|journal=Psychology of Sport and Exercise|language=en|volume=39|pages=10\u201319|doi=10.1016/j.psychsport.2018.07.003|issn=1469-0292}}</ref> studied how physical education teachers' autonomy support versus control would relate to students' wellness, knowledge, performance, and intentions to persist at physical activity beyond the PE classes.

Students who received the rationale showed greater interest, work ethic, and determination.\n\n[[Structural equation modeling]] was used to test three alternative explanatory models to understand why the rationale produced such benefits:\n# An identified regulation model based on self-determination theory\n# An interest regulation model based on interest-enhancing strategies research\n# An additive model that integrated both models.\n\nThe data fit all three models; but only the model based on self-determination theory helped students to engage and learn. Findings show the role that externally provided rationales can play in helping students generate the motivation they need to engage in and learn from uninteresting, but personally important, material.<ref name=\"Jang, H. 2008\" />\n\nThe importance of these findings to those in the field of education is that when teachers try to find ways to promote student's motivation during relatively uninteresting learning activities, they can successfully do so by promoting the value of the task. One way teachers can help students value what they may deem \"uninteresting\" is by providing a rationale that identifies the lesson's otherwise hidden value, helps students understand why the lesson is genuinely worth their effort, and communicates why the lesson can be expected to be useful to them.<ref name=\"Jang, H. 2008\" />\n\nAn example of SDT and education are [[Sudbury school|Sudbury Model schools]] where people decide for themselves how to spend their days. In these schools, students of all ages determine what they do, as well as when, how, and where they do it. This freedom is at the heart of the school; it belongs to the students as their right, not to be violated. The fundamental premises of the school are simple: that all people are curious by nature; that the most efficient, long-lasting, and profound learning takes place when started and pursued by the learner; that all people are creative if they are allowed to develop their unique talents; that age-mixing among students promotes growth in all members of the group; and that freedom is essential to the development of personal responsibility. In practice this means that students initiate all their own activities and create their own environments. The physical plant, the staff, and the equipment are there for the students to use as the need arises. The school provides a setting in which students are independent, are trusted, and are treated as responsible people; and a community in which students are exposed to the complexities of life in the framework of a participatory democracy. Sudbury schools do not perform and do not offer evaluations, assessments, or recommendations, asserting that they do not rate people, and that school is not a judge; comparing students to each other, or to some standard that has been set is for them a violation of the student's right to privacy and to self-determination. Students decide for themselves how to measure their progress as self-starting learners as a process of self-evaluation: real lifelong learning and the proper educational evaluation for the 21st century, they adduce.<ref name=\"Greenberg, D. 1995\">Greenberg, D.(1995).

In contrast, individuals who consider themselves autonomous tend to be initiators of actions rather than followers.  Research examining the relationship between self-determination theory and alcohol use among college students has indicated that individuals with the former criteria for decision making are associated with greater alcohol consumption and drinking as a function of social pressure.  For instance, in a study conducted by Knee and Neighbors,<ref name=\"Knee, C. R. 2002\">{{cite journal | last1 = Knee | first1 = C.

Given the evidence suggesting a positive association between an outward motivation and drinking, and the potential role of perceived social influence in this association, understanding the precise nature of this relationship seems important. Further, it may be hypothesized that the relationship between self-determination and drinking may be mediated to some extent by the perceived approval of others.<ref name=\"Chawla, N. 2009\">{{cite journal | last1 = Chawla | first1 = N. | last2 = Neighbors | first2 = C. | last3 = Logan | first3 = D. | last4 = Lewis | first4 = M.A. | last5 = Fossos | first5 = N. | year = 2009 | title = Perceived approval of friends and parents as mediators of the relationship between self-determination and drinking | url = | journal = Journal of Studies on Alcohol and Drugs | volume = 70 | issue = 1| pages = 92\u2013100 | doi=10.15288/jsad.2009.70.92| pmid = 19118397 | pmc = 2629627 }}</ref>\n\n==Motivational interviewing==\n[[Motivational interviewing]] (MI) is a popular approach to positive behavioral change.

The participants rank 16 total statements (four in each category of amotivation) on a 1-7 Likert scale.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Pelletier|first=Luc G.|author2=Dion, S. |author3=Tuson, K. |author4=Green-Demers, I. |title= Why do people fail to adopt environmental protective behaviors?

Monetary incentives, persuasive communication, and convenience are often successful in the short term, but when the intervention is removed, behavior is discontinued. In the long run, such intervention strategies are therefore expensive and difficult to maintain.<ref name=\"Green-Demers\"/>\n\nSelf-determination theory explains that environmental behavior that is not motivated intrinsically is not persistent. On the other hand, when self-determination is high, behavior is more likely to occur repeatedly. The importance of intrinsic motivation is particularly apparent with more difficult behaviors. While they are less likely to be performed in general, people with high internal motivation are more likely to perform them more frequently than people with low intrinsic motivation. 5 Subjects scoring high on intrinsic motivation and supporting ecological well-being also reported a high level of happiness.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Brown|first=Kirk W.|author2=Kasser, T. |title=Are psychological and ecological well-being compatible?

So SDT emphasises humans' natural growth toward positive motivation; however, this is thwarted if their basic needs are not fulfilled.\n\n===Needs===\nSDT supports three basic psychological needs that must be satisfied to foster well-being and health. These needs can be universally applied. However, some may be more salient than others at certain times and are expressed differently based on time, culture, or experience.\n\n;'''Competence''' :Seek to control the outcome and experience mastery.<ref name=\"White, R.

L. 2004\" /> note this does not mean to be independent of others.\n\n===Motivations===\nSDT claims to give a different approach to motivation, considering what motivates a person at any given time as opposed to seeing motivation as a unitary concept. SDT makes distinctions between different types of motivation and the consequences of them.\n\n====Intrinsic motivation====\n[[Intrinsic motivation]] is the natural, inherent drive to seek out challenges and new possibilities that SDT associates with cognitive and social development.\n\n''[[Cognitive evaluation theory]]'' (CET)<ref name=\"Deci, E. L. 1985\">Deci, E. L., & Ryan, R. M. (1985). ''Intrinsic motivation and self-determination in human behaviour''. New York: Plenum.</ref> is a sub-theory of SDT that specifies factors explaining intrinsic motivation and variability with it and looks at how social and environmental factors help or hinder intrinsic motivations.\nCET focuses on the needs of competence and autonomy. CET is offered as an explanation of the phenomenon known as [[Motivation crowding theory|motivational \"crowding out.\"]]\n\nClaiming social context events like feedback on work or rewards lead to feelings of competence and so enhance intrinsic motivations. Deci<ref name=\"Deci, E. L. 1975\" /> found positive feedback enhanced intrinsic motivations and negative feedback diminished it. Vallerand and Reid<ref name=\"Vallerand, R. J. 1984\">{{cite journal | last1 = Vallerand | first1 = R.

For this to happen there must be immediate contextual support for both needs or inner resources based on prior development support for both needs.<ref name=\"Reeve, J. 1996\">Reeve, J. (1996). ''Motivating others''. Needham Heights, MA: Allyn & Bacon.</ref>\n\nCET and intrinsic motivation is also linked to relatedness through the hypothesis that intrinsic motivation flourishes if linked with a sense of security and relatedness. Grolnick and Ryan<ref name=\"Grolnick, W. S. 1989\">{{cite journal | last1 = Grolnick | first1 = W. S. | last2 = Ryan | first2 = R.

Deci and Ryan<ref name=\"Deci, E. L. 1985\" /> developed organismic integration theory (OIT), as a sub-theory of SDT, to explain the different ways extrinsically motivated behaviour is regulated.\n\nOIT details the different forms of extrinsic motivation and the contexts in which they come about. It is the context of such motivation that concerns the SDT theory as these contexts affect whether the motivations are internalised and so integrated into the sense of self.\n\nOIT describes four different types of extrinsic motivations that often vary in terms of their relative autonomy:\n\n# '''Externally regulated behaviour''': Is the least autonomous, it is performed because of external demand or possible reward. Such actions can be seen to have an externally perceived [[locus of control]].<ref name=\"deCharms, R. 1968\"/>\n# '''Introjected regulation of behaviour''': describes taking on regulations to behaviour but not fully accepting said regulations as your own.

Kemis (Ed.), ''Efficacy, agency, and self-esteem'' (pp.&nbsp;31&ndash;49). New York: Plenum.</ref> claim such behaviour normally represents regulation by contingent self-esteem, citing ego involvement as a classic form of introjections.<ref name=\"Ryan, R.

While this is internally driven, introjected behavior has an external perceived locus of causality or not coming from one's self.  Since the causality of the behavior is perceived as external, the behavior is considered non-self-determined.\n# '''Regulation through identification''': a more autonomously driven form of extrinsic motivation. It involves consciously valuing a goal or regulation so that said action is accepted as personally important.\n# '''Integrated Regulation''': Is the most autonomous kind of extrinsic motivation.  Occurring when regulations are fully assimilated with self so they are included in a person's self evaluations and beliefs on personal needs.  Because of this, integrated motivations share qualities with intrinsic motivation but are still classified as extrinsic because the goals that are trying to be achieved are for reasons extrinsic to the self, rather than the inherent enjoyment or interest in the task.\n\nExtrinsically motivated behaviours can be integrated into self.  OIT proposes internalization is more likely to occur when there is a sense of relatedness.\n\nRyan, Stiller and Lynch<ref name=\"Ryan, R. M. 1994\">{{cite journal | last1 = Ryan | first1 = R.

W. 1959\"/> and deCharms<ref name=\"deCharms, R. 1968\"/> proposed that the need for competence and autonomy is the basis of intrinsic motivation and behaviour. This is a link between people's basic needs and their motivations.\n\n===Autonomy===\nDeci<ref name=\"Deci, E. L. 1971\">{{cite journal | last1 = Deci | first1 = E. L. | year = 1971 | title = Effects of externally mediated rewards on intrinsic motivation | url = | journal = Journal of Personality and Social Psychology | volume = 18 | issue = | pages = 105\u2013115 | doi=10.1037/h0030644}}</ref> found that offering people extrinsic rewards for behaviour that is intrinsically motivated undermined the intrinsic motivation as they grow less interested in it. Initially intrinsically motivated behaviour becomes controlled by external rewards, which undermines their autonomy.\n\nFurther research by Amabile, DeJong and Lepper<ref name=\"Amabile, T. M. 1976\">{{cite journal | last1 = Amabile | first1 = T.

Studies looking at choice have found that increasing a participant's options and choices increases their intrinsic motivation.<ref name=\"Zuckerman, M. 1978\">{{cite journal | last1 = Zuckerman | first1 = M. | last2 = Porac | first2 = J. | last3 = Lathin | first3 = D. | last4 = Smith | first4 = R. | last5 = Deci | first5 = E.

L. 1971\" /> found that giving people unexpected positive feedback on a task increases people's intrinsic motivation to do it, meaning that this was because the positive feedback was fulfilling people's need for competence. In fact, giving positive feedback on a task served only to increase people's intrinsic motivation and decreased extrinsic motivation for the task.\n\nVallerand and Reid<ref name=\"Vallerand, R. J. 1984\" /> found negative feedback has the opposite effect (i.e., decreasing intrinsic motivation by taking away from people's need for competence).\n\n===Relatedness===\nDuring a study on the relationship between infants' attachment styles, their exhibition of mastery-oriented behaviour, and their affect during play, Frodi, Bridges and Grolnick<ref name=\"Frodi, A. 1985\">{{cite journal | last1 = Frodi | first1 = A. | last2 = Bridges | first2 = L. | last3 = Grolnick | first3 = W.

Obviously, replications of all the attachment-motivation relations are needed with different and larger samples.\"\n\n==Individual differences==\nSDT argues that needs are innate but can be developed in a social context. Some people develop stronger needs than others, creating individual differences. However, individual differences within the theory focus on concepts resulting from the degree to which needs have been satisfied or not satisfied.\n\nWithin SDT there are two general individual difference concepts, Causality Orientations and Life Goals.\n\n===Causality orientations===\nCausality orientations are motivational orientations that refer either to the way people orient to an environment and regulate their behaviour because of this, or to the extent to which they are self determined in general across many settings. SDT created three orientations: autonomous, controlled and impersonal.\n\n# '''Autonomous Orientations''': result from satisfaction of the basic needs\n# '''Strong controlled orientations''': Result from satisfaction of competence and relatedness needs but not of autonomy and is linked to regulation through internal and external contingencies, which lead to rigid functioning and diminished well being.\n# '''Impersonal Orientations''': Results from failing to fulfill all three needs.  This is also related to poor functioning and ill being.\n\nAccording to the theory, people have a certain amount of each of the orientations, which can be used to make predictions on a person's psychological health and behavioural outcomes.\n\n===Life goals===\nLife goals are long-term goals people use to guide their activities, and they fall into two categories:<ref name=\"Kasser, T. 1993\">{{cite journal | last1 = Kasser | first1 = T. | last2 = Ryan | first2 = R.

L. 1971\" /> investigated the effects of external rewards on intrinsic motivation in two laboratory and one field experiment. Based on the results from earlier animal and human studies regarding intrinsic motivation the author explored two possibilities. In the first two experiments he looked at the effect of extrinsic rewards in terms of a decrease in intrinsic motivation to perform a task. Earlier studies showed contradictory or inconclusive findings regarding decrease in performance on a task following an external reward. The third experiment was based on findings of developmental learning theorists and looked at whether a different type of reward enhances intrinsic motivation to participate in an activity.\n\n====Experiment I====\nThis experiment tested the hypothesis that if an individual is intrinsically motivated to perform an activity, introduction of an extrinsic reward decreases the degree of intrinsic motivation to perform the task.\n\nTwenty-four undergraduate psychology students participated in the first laboratory experiment and were assigned to experimental (''n'' = 12) and control group (''n'' = 12). Each group participated in three sessions conducted on three different days. During the sessions, participants were engaged in working on a [[Soma cube]] puzzle\u2014which the experimenters assumed was an activity college students would be intrinsically motivated to do. The puzzle could be put together to form numerous different configurations. In each session, the participants were shown four different configurations drawn on a piece of paper and were asked to use the puzzle to reproduce the configurations while they were being timed.\n\nThe first and third session of the experimental condition were identical to control, but in the second session the participants in the experimental condition were given a dollar for completing each puzzle within time. During the middle of each session, the experimenter left the room for eight minutes and the participants were told that they were free to do whatever they wanted during that time, while the experimenter observed during that period. The amount of time spent working on the puzzle during the free choice period was used to measure motivation.\n\nAs Deci expected, when external reward was introduced during session two, the participants spent more time working on the puzzles during the free choice period in comparison to session 1 and when the external reward was removed in the third session, the time spent working on the puzzle dropped lower than the first session. All subjects reported finding the task interesting and enjoyable at the end of each session, providing evidence for the experimenter's assumption that the task was intrinsically motivating for the college students. The study showed some support of the experimenter's hypothesis and a trend towards decrease in intrinsic motivation was seen after money was provided to the participants as external reward.\n\n====Experiment II====\nThe second experiment was a field experiment, similar to laboratory Experiment I, but was conducted in a natural setting.\n\nEight student workers were observed at a college biweekly newspaper. Four of the students served as a control group and worked on Friday. The experimental group worked on Tuesdays.\n\nThe control and experimental group students were not aware that they were being observed. The 10-week observation was divided into three time periods. The task in this study required the students to write headlines for the newspaper.\n\nDuring \"Time 2\", the students in the experimental group were given 50 cents for each headline they wrote. At the end of Time 2, they were told that in the future the newspaper cannot pay them 50 cent for each headline anymore as the newspaper ran out of the money allocated for that and they were not paid for the headlines during Time 3.\n\nThe speed of task completion (headlines) was used as a measure of motivation in this experiment. Absences were used as a measure of attitudes.\n\nTo assess the stability of the observed effect, the experimenter observed the students again (Time 4) for two weeks. There was a gap of five weeks between Time 3 and Time 4. Due to absences and change in assignment etc., motivation data was not available for all students. The results of this experiment were similar to Experiment I and monetary reward was found to decrease the intrinsic motivation of the students, supporting Deci's hypothesis.\n\n====Experiment III====\nExperiment III was also conducted in the laboratory and was identical to Experiment I in all respects except for the kind of external reward provided to the students in experimental condition during Session 2.\n\nIn this experiment, verbal praise was used as an extrinsic reward.\n\nThe experimenter hypothesized that a different type of reward\u2014i.e., social approval in the form of verbal reinforcement and positive feedback for performing the task that a person is intrinsically motivated to perform\u2014enhances the degree of external motivation, even after the extrinsic reward is removed.\n\nThe results of the experiment III confirmed the hypothesis and the students' performance increased significantly during the third session in comparison to session one, showing that verbal praise and positive feedback enhances performance in tasks that a person is initially intrinsically motivated to perform. This provides evidence that verbal praise as external reward increases intrinsic motivation.\n\nThe author explained differences between the two types of external rewards as having different effects on intrinsic motivation. When a person is intrinsically motivated to perform a task and money is introduced to work on the task, the individual cognitively re-evaluates the importance of the task and the intrinsic motivation to perform the task (because the individual finds it interesting) shifts to extrinsic motivation and the primary focus changes from enjoying the task to gaining financial reward.  However, when verbal praise is provided in a similar situation increases intrinsic motivation as it is not evaluated to be controlled by external factors and the person sees the task as an enjoyable task that is performed autonomously.  The increase in intrinsic motivation is explained by [[positive reinforcement]] and an increase in perceived locus of control to perform the task.\n\n===Pritchard, Campbell and Campbell (1977): Evaluation of Deci's Hypothesis===\nPritchard, Campbell and Campbell<ref name=\"Pritchard, R. 1977\">{{cite journal | last1 = Pritchard | first1 = R. | last2 = Campbell | first2 = K. | last3 = Campbell | first3 = D. | year = 1977 | title = Effects of extrinsic financial rewards on intrinsic motivation | url = | journal = Journal of Applied Psychology | volume = 62 | issue = | pages = 9\u201315 | doi=10.1037/0021-9010.62.1.9}}</ref> conducted a similar study to evaluate Deci's hypothesis regarding the role of extrinsic rewards on decreasing intrinsic motivation.\n\nParticipants were randomly assigned to two groups. A chess-problem task was used in this study. Data was collected in two sessions.\n\n====Session I====\nParticipants were asked to complete a background questionnaire that included questions on the amount of time the participant played chess during the week, the number of years that the participant has been playing chess for, amount of enjoyment the participant gets from playing the game, etc.\n\nThe participants in both groups were then told that the experimenter needed to enter the information in the computer and for the next 10 minutes the participant were free to do whatever they liked.\n\nThe experimenter left the room for 10 minutes. The room had similar chess-problem tasks on the table, some magazines as well as coffee was made available for the participants if they chose to have it.\n\nThe time spent on the chess-problem task was observed through a one way mirror by the experimenter during the 10 minutes break and was used as a measure of intrinsic motivation. After the experimenter returned, the experimental group was told that there was a monetary reward for the participant who could work on the most chess problems in the given time and that the reward is for this session only and would not be offered during the next session. The control group was not offered a monetary reward.\n\n====Session II====\nThe second session was the same for the two groups:\n\nAfter a filler task, the experimenter left the room for 10 minutes and the time participants spent on the chess-problem task was observed. The experimental group was reminded that there was no reward for the task this time.\n\nAfter both sessions the participants were required to respond to questionnaires evaluating the task, i.e. to what degree did they find the task interesting. Both groups reported that they found the task interesting.\n\nThe results of the study showed that the experimental group showed a significant decrease in time spent on the chess-problem task during the 10-minute free time from session 1 to session 2 in comparison to the group that was not paid, thus confirming the hypothesis presented by Deci that contingent monetary reward for an activity decreases the intrinsic motivation to perform that activity. Other studies were conducted around this time focusing on other types of rewards as well as other external factors that play a role in decreasing intrinsic motivation.<ref name=\"eg Amabile, T.

Specifically, the researchers looked at the effect of motivational climate generated by peers on exercisers by analyzing data collected through questionnaires and rating scales. The assessment included evaluation of motivational climate, basic psychological needs satisfaction, levels of self-determination and self-regulation (amotivation, external, introjected, identified and intrinsic regulation) and also the assessment of the level of satisfaction and enjoyment in exercising.\n\nData analysis revealed that when peers are supportive and there is an emphasis on cooperation, effort, and personal improvement, the climate influences variables like basic psychological needs, motivation and enjoyment. The task climate positively predicted the three basic psychological needs (competence, autonomy and relatedness) and so positively predicted self-determined motivation. Task climate and the resulting self-determination were also found to positively influence level of enjoyment the exercisers experienced during the activity.\n\nBehzadniaa, Adachi, Deci, and Mohammadzadeh<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite journal|last=Behzadnia|first=B.|last2=Adachi|first2=P.J.C.|last3=Deci|first3=E.L.|last4=Mohammadzadeh|first4=H.|date=2018-11-01|title=Associations between students' perceptions of physical education teachers' interpersonal styles and students' wellness, knowledge, performance, and intentions to persist at physical activity: A self-determination theory approach|journal=Psychology of Sport and Exercise|language=en|volume=39|pages=10\u201319|doi=10.1016/j.psychsport.2018.07.003|issn=1469-0292}}</ref> studied how physical education teachers' autonomy support versus control would relate to students' wellness, knowledge, performance, and intentions to persist at physical activity beyond the PE classes.

Students who received the rationale showed greater interest, work ethic, and determination.\n\n[[Structural equation modeling]] was used to test three alternative explanatory models to understand why the rationale produced such benefits:\n# An identified regulation model based on self-determination theory\n# An interest regulation model based on interest-enhancing strategies research\n# An additive model that integrated both models.\n\nThe data fit all three models; but only the model based on self-determination theory helped students to engage and learn. Findings show the role that externally provided rationales can play in helping students generate the motivation they need to engage in and learn from uninteresting, but personally important, material.<ref name=\"Jang, H. 2008\" />\n\nThe importance of these findings to those in the field of education is that when teachers try to find ways to promote student's motivation during relatively uninteresting learning activities, they can successfully do so by promoting the value of the task. One way teachers can help students value what they may deem \"uninteresting\" is by providing a rationale that identifies the lesson's otherwise hidden value, helps students understand why the lesson is genuinely worth their effort, and communicates why the lesson can be expected to be useful to them.<ref name=\"Jang, H. 2008\" />\n\nAn example of SDT and education are [[Sudbury school|Sudbury Model schools]] where people decide for themselves how to spend their days. In these schools, students of all ages determine what they do, as well as when, how, and where they do it. This freedom is at the heart of the school; it belongs to the students as their right, not to be violated. The fundamental premises of the school are simple: that all people are curious by nature; that the most efficient, long-lasting, and profound learning takes place when started and pursued by the learner; that all people are creative if they are allowed to develop their unique talents; that age-mixing among students promotes growth in all members of the group; and that freedom is essential to the development of personal responsibility. In practice this means that students initiate all their own activities and create their own environments. The physical plant, the staff, and the equipment are there for the students to use as the need arises. The school provides a setting in which students are independent, are trusted, and are treated as responsible people; and a community in which students are exposed to the complexities of life in the framework of a participatory democracy. Sudbury schools do not perform and do not offer evaluations, assessments, or recommendations, asserting that they do not rate people, and that school is not a judge; comparing students to each other, or to some standard that has been set is for them a violation of the student's right to privacy and to self-determination. Students decide for themselves how to measure their progress as self-starting learners as a process of self-evaluation: real lifelong learning and the proper educational evaluation for the 21st century, they adduce.<ref name=\"Greenberg, D. 1995\">Greenberg, D.(1995).

In contrast, individuals who consider themselves autonomous tend to be initiators of actions rather than followers.  Research examining the relationship between self-determination theory and alcohol use among college students has indicated that individuals with the former criteria for decision making are associated with greater alcohol consumption and drinking as a function of social pressure.  For instance, in a study conducted by Knee and Neighbors,<ref name=\"Knee, C. R. 2002\">{{cite journal | last1 = Knee | first1 = C. R. | last2 = Neighbors | first2 = C. | year = 2002 | title = Self-determination, perception of peer pressure, and drinking among college students | url = https://semanticscholar.org/paper/97461c4f44c9435cddec23f176ad3509460074cd| journal = Journal of Applied Social Psychology | volume = 32 | issue = 3| pages = 522\u2013543 | doi=10.1111/j.1559-1816.2002.tb00228.x}}</ref> external factors in the individuals who claim to not be motivated by internal factors were found to be associated with drinking for extrinsic reasons, and with stronger perceptions of peer pressure, which in turn was related to heavier alcohol use. Given the evidence suggesting a positive association between an outward motivation and drinking, and the potential role of perceived social influence in this association, understanding the precise nature of this relationship seems important. Further, it may be hypothesized that the relationship between self-determination and drinking may be mediated to some extent by the perceived approval of others.<ref name=\"Chawla, N. 2009\">{{cite journal | last1 = Chawla | first1 = N. | last2 = Neighbors | first2 = C. | last3 = Logan | first3 = D. | last4 = Lewis | first4 = M.A. | last5 = Fossos | first5 = N. | year = 2009 | title = Perceived approval of friends and parents as mediators of the relationship between self-determination and drinking | url = | journal = Journal of Studies on Alcohol and Drugs | volume = 70 | issue = 1| pages = 92\u2013100 | doi=10.15288/jsad.2009.70.92| pmid = 19118397 | pmc = 2629627 }}</ref>\n\n==Motivational interviewing==\n[[Motivational interviewing]] (MI) is a popular approach to positive behavioral change. Used initially in the area of addiction (Miller & Rollnick, 2002),<ref>Miller, W. R., & Rollnick, S. (2002). ''Motivational interviewing: Preparing people for change (2nd ed.)''. New York: Guilford Press.</ref> it is now used for a wider range of issues. It is a client-centered method that doesn't persuade or coerce patients to change and instead attempts to explore and resolve their ambivalent feelings, which allows them to choose themselves whether to change or not.\n\nMarkland, Ryan, Tobin, and Rollnick<ref name=\"Markland, D. 2005\">{{cite journal | last1 = Markland | first1 = D. | last2 = Ryan | first2 = R.

Self-determination theory suggests that motivation can predict behavior performance. Pelletier et al. (1998) constructed a scale of motivation for environmental behavior, which consists of 4x6 statements (4 statements for each type of motivation on the SDT motivation scale: intrinsic, integrated, identified, introjected, external, and amotivation) responding to a question 'Why are you doing things for the environment?'. Each item is scored on a 1-7 Likert scale.<ref name=\"Pelletier 1998 437\u2013468\">{{cite journal|last=Pelletier|first=Luc G.|author2=Tuson, K.

(1999) shows that four personal beliefs, helplessness, strategy, capacity, and effort, lead to greater amotivation, while self-determination has an inverse relationship with amotivation. The Amotivation toward the Environment Scale measures the four reasons for amotivation by answering a question 'Why are you not doing things for the environment?'. The participants rank 16 total statements (four in each category of amotivation) on a 1-7 Likert scale.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Pelletier|first=Luc G.|author2=Dion, S. |author3=Tuson, K. |author4=Green-Demers, I. |title= Why do people fail to adopt environmental protective behaviors?

Monetary incentives, persuasive communication, and convenience are often successful in the short term, but when the intervention is removed, behavior is discontinued. In the long run, such intervention strategies are therefore expensive and difficult to maintain.<ref name=\"Green-Demers\"/>\n\nSelf-determination theory explains that environmental behavior that is not motivated intrinsically is not persistent. On the other hand, when self-determination is high, behavior is more likely to occur repeatedly. The importance of intrinsic motivation is particularly apparent with more difficult behaviors. While they are less likely to be performed in general, people with high internal motivation are more likely to perform them more frequently than people with low intrinsic motivation. 5 Subjects scoring high on intrinsic motivation and supporting ecological well-being also reported a high level of happiness.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Brown|first=Kirk W.|author2=Kasser, T. |title=Are psychological and ecological well-being compatible?

In their study, 162 university students chose an environmental goal and performed it for a week. Perceived autonomy, success in performing chosen behavior, and their future intention to continue were measured. The results suggested that people with higher degree of self-perceived autonomy successfully perform behaviors and are more likely to do so in the long term.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Obaldiston|first=Richard|author2=Sheldon, K.

Balagtas is {{convert|30|km}} from [[Manila]] and is {{convert|15|km}} from [[Malolos City]].\n\nFormerly known as '''Bigaa''', it was renamed in honor of Filipino poet [[Francisco Balagtas]]. The [[MacArthur Highway]] bisects the municipality of Balagtas as this national road cuts northward to the Ilocos region. At the southern approach of the town from Manila is a concrete bridge that crosses the Balagtas River. The river, navigable by banca and motor boats, empties into Manila bay after snaking through the town of Bulacan to the West which provides Balagtas' townsfolk with fish, shrimp, and other fresh water food.\n\nAt the foot of the bridge, along the highway towards the North, is the town hall. In front of the town hall is a park where the monument of its hero, [[Francisco Balagtas|Francisco \"Balagtas\" Baltazar]] is located. The town hall is surrounded by Spanish colonial type houses. Two hundred meters from the municipal hall is the barrio of Panginay, the birthplace of Francisco Balagtas, for whom also \"Balagtasan\", a form of debate in versified Tagalog, was named. In 1946 the Historical Society of the Philippines placed a marker at the birthplace of Balagtas. In reverence to the hero's deeds, the official name of Bigaa was changed to Balagtas through the legislative act sponsored by then Congressman, Teodulo Natividad.\n\n==History==\n[[File:Bigaa1899.jpg|200px|thumbnail|left|American infantry firing at Filipino insurgents at Balagtas, 1899.]]\nOriginally known as Caruya/Caluya as per as the history records regarding the early years of the establishment of  Bulacan Province, Caruya was one of the Encomiendas of the vast region La Pampanga falls under  the Alcalde Mayor of Bulacan. Encomienda de Caruya was Encomienda of the King of Spain which appeared in Miguel de Loarca's Relacion delas Isla Filipinas in 1582 and the Report of Governor- General Luis Perez de Dasmari\u00f1as of June 21, 1591 document. The propagation of catholic instructions in Caruya initially belongs to Bulakan Convent and it was directly administered by Alcalde Mayor of Bulacan but it was transferred to Malolos Convent at uncertain date. Bigaa is one of the ancient towns of the Province together with Calumpit 1571 (became Town in 1575) Bulakan 1575 (became Town in 1578) Meycauayan 1578, Malolos 1571 (became Town in 1580) and Binto 1581 (a former visita of Malolos became Town renamed as Binto y Quingua 1602) later known as Plaridel. The Catalogo of 1591 indicates the existence of Guiguinto y Caruyan with 4,800 souls and it was administered by a religious from Bulacan Convent. In 1608 Historia dela Provincia Agustiana  mentioned Caruyan as pueblo and convent.\nThe Catalogo of 1612 says that Caruyan had 2 sacerdos, 800 Tributos, 2,400 Almas. (Historia de La Provincia Agustiana del Santisimo Nombre de Jesus de Filipinas\nVol.1 of Isacio Rodriguez OSA)\n\nOn other data, the Center for Bulacan Studies in their \"La Primera Provincia\" published in 2010 p.&nbsp;138 mentioned that Bigaa came from Malolos as its matrix with a date independency date of 1621. It could be assumed that Bigaa was later transferred to Malolos Convent in uncertain date but La Primera did not mention that Bigaa originally came from Bulakan town but instead in Malolos.\n\nLong time before the construction of the church at Poblacion, the original location of the town center where the hermitage and  the base of Spanish instruction in Bigaa was at Barrio Dalig where Sitio Caruyan was located.\n\nIt is very unclear when Caruya was formally organized into administrative town with its own Gobernadorcillo. It was  renamed to Bigaa sometime in 1700s. Bigaa suggest a kind of plant which is Taro o Gabi.\n\nDuring the Philippine revolution the \"insurrectos\" and the \"Guardia civiles\". Many people died, further decimating the town, which has suffered from a cholera epidemic and nearly wiped out the population 20 years before. When the Americans established civil government in 1903, Bigaa and Bocaue was integrated each other and in 1911  it was separated again and on the same year,1911 the former Hacienda de Pandi, which included in the geographical jurisdiction of Town of Bigaa. In 1946, during the tenure of Bigaa Mayor Manuel Santos, Pandi was detached from Bigaa shortly after the Philippines gained political freedom from the United States and Pandi was established as a Municipal entity by virtue of a legislative fiat.\n\n==Barangays==\nBalagtas is politically subdivided into 9 [[barangay]]s, all classified as urban:\n\n<!-- arranged by PSGC for easier updates in the future -->\n{{PH brgy table lite|top}}\n{{PH brgy table lite|031402002| Borol 2nd                |  7243|  7801}}\n{{PH brgy table lite|031402003| Borol 1st                | 10190| 10179}}\n{{PH brgy table lite|031402004| Dalig                    |  1949|  1832}}\n{{PH brgy table lite|031402005| Longos                   |  2779|  2607}}\n{{PH brgy table lite|031402007| Panginay                 | 12578| 12461}}\n{{PH brgy table lite|031402008| Pulong Gubat             |  7701|  4141}}\n{{PH brgy table lite|031402009| San Juan                 | 10158|  9238}}\n{{PH brgy table lite|031402010| Santol                   | 16346| 12465}}\n{{PH brgy table lite|031402011| Wawa (''[[Poblacion]]'') |  4985|  4716}}\n{{PH brgy table lite|bottom|65440}}\n\n==Demographics==\n{{Philippine Census \n| align= none\n| title= Population census of Balagtas\n| 1903 = 8000\n| 1918 = 9875\n| 1939 = 12037\n| 1948 = 8085\n| 1960 = 10280\n| 1970 = 17109\n| 1975 = 21422\n| 1980 = 28654\n| 1990 = 42658\n| 1995 = 49210\n| 2000 = 56945\n| 2007 = 62684\n| 2010 = 65440\n| 2015 = 73929\n| 2020 =\n| 2025 =\n| 2030 =\n| footnote= Source: [[Philippine Statistics Authority]]{{PH census|2015}}{{PH census|2010}}{{PH census|2007}}{{LWUA population data}} \n}}\n\nIn the {{PH wikidata|population_as_of}}, the population of Balagtas, Bulacan, was {{PH wikidata|population_total}} people,{{PH census|current}} with a density of {{convert|{{sigfig|{{PH wikidata|population_total}}/{{PH wikidata|area}}|2}}|PD/km2|disp=or}}.\n\n==Economy==\n;Major Industries\n* Ceramics/Pottery\n* Furniture\n* Garments\n* Gifts/Houseware/Decors\n* Metalcraft\n* Poultry\n;Major Products\n* Furniture/Agricultural Products\n* Balot and Penoy Industry\n* Recruitment Agency\n* Fruit Dealership\n* Tilapia\n* Tricycle Parts\n\n;Future Developments\n* Construction of North Food Exchange (under construction)\n* Opening of Balagtas Tollgate\n* Construction of new Balagtas to Baliwag road connection\n\n==Government==\nMunicipal Officials:\n*Mayor: Eladio \"Kap JR.\" Gonzales\n*Vice Mayor: Alberto \"Bobby\" Carating Jr.\n*Councilors:\n** Mikee Jane \"Monay\" Payuran\n** Analyn Jose\n** Fernando K.

The river, navigable by banca and motor boats, empties into Manila bay after snaking through the town of Bulacan to the West which provides Balagtas' townsfolk with fish, shrimp, and other fresh water food.\n\nAt the foot of the bridge, along the highway towards the North, is the town hall. In front of the town hall is a park where the monument of its hero, [[Francisco Balagtas|Francisco \"Balagtas\" Baltazar]] is located. The town hall is surrounded by Spanish colonial type houses. Two hundred meters from the municipal hall is the barrio of Panginay, the birthplace of Francisco Balagtas, for whom also \"Balagtasan\", a form of debate in versified Tagalog, was named. In 1946 the Historical Society of the Philippines placed a marker at the birthplace of Balagtas. In reverence to the hero's deeds, the official name of Bigaa was changed to Balagtas through the legislative act sponsored by then Congressman, Teodulo Natividad.\n\n==History==\n[[File:Bigaa1899.jpg|200px|thumbnail|left|American infantry firing at Filipino insurgents at Balagtas, 1899.]]\nOriginally known as Caruya/Caluya as per as the history records regarding the early years of the establishment of  Bulacan Province, Caruya was one of the Encomiendas of the vast region La Pampanga falls under  the Alcalde Mayor of Bulacan. Encomienda de Caruya was Encomienda of the King of Spain which appeared in Miguel de Loarca's Relacion delas Isla Filipinas in 1582 and the Report of Governor- General Luis Perez de Dasmari\u00f1as of June 21, 1591 document. The propagation of catholic instructions in Caruya initially belongs to Bulakan Convent and it was directly administered by Alcalde Mayor of Bulacan but it was transferred to Malolos Convent at uncertain date. Bigaa is one of the ancient towns of the Province together with Calumpit 1571 (became Town in 1575) Bulakan 1575 (became Town in 1578) Meycauayan 1578, Malolos 1571 (became Town in 1580) and Binto 1581 (a former visita of Malolos became Town renamed as Binto y Quingua 1602) later known as Plaridel. The Catalogo of 1591 indicates the existence of Guiguinto y Caruyan with 4,800 souls and it was administered by a religious from Bulacan Convent. In 1608 Historia dela Provincia Agustiana  mentioned Caruyan as pueblo and convent.\nThe Catalogo of 1612 says that Caruyan had 2 sacerdos, 800 Tributos, 2,400 Almas. (Historia de La Provincia Agustiana del Santisimo Nombre de Jesus de Filipinas\nVol.1 of Isacio Rodriguez OSA)\n\nOn other data, the Center for Bulacan Studies in their \"La Primera Provincia\" published in 2010 p.&nbsp;138 mentioned that Bigaa came from Malolos as its matrix with a date independency date of 1621. It could be assumed that Bigaa was later transferred to Malolos Convent in uncertain date but La Primera did not mention that Bigaa originally came from Bulakan town but instead in Malolos.\n\nLong time before the construction of the church at Poblacion, the original location of the town center where the hermitage and  the base of Spanish instruction in Bigaa was at Barrio Dalig where Sitio Caruyan was located.\n\nIt is very unclear when Caruya was formally organized into administrative town with its own Gobernadorcillo. It was  renamed to Bigaa sometime in 1700s. Bigaa suggest a kind of plant which is Taro o Gabi.\n\nDuring the Philippine revolution the \"insurrectos\" and the \"Guardia civiles\". Many people died, further decimating the town, which has suffered from a cholera epidemic and nearly wiped out the population 20 years before. When the Americans established civil government in 1903, Bigaa and Bocaue was integrated each other and in 1911  it was separated again and on the same year,1911 the former Hacienda de Pandi, which included in the geographical jurisdiction of Town of Bigaa. In 1946, during the tenure of Bigaa Mayor Manuel Santos, Pandi was detached from Bigaa shortly after the Philippines gained political freedom from the United States and Pandi was established as a Municipal entity by virtue of a legislative fiat.\n\n==Barangays==\nBalagtas is politically subdivided into 9 [[barangay]]s, all classified as urban:\n\n<!-- arranged by PSGC for easier updates in the future -->\n{{PH brgy table lite|top}}\n{{PH brgy table lite|031402002| Borol 2nd                |  7243|  7801}}\n{{PH brgy table lite|031402003| Borol 1st                | 10190| 10179}}\n{{PH brgy table lite|031402004| Dalig                    |  1949|  1832}}\n{{PH brgy table lite|031402005| Longos                   |  2779|  2607}}\n{{PH brgy table lite|031402007| Panginay                 | 12578| 12461}}\n{{PH brgy table lite|031402008| Pulong Gubat             |  7701|  4141}}\n{{PH brgy table lite|031402009| San Juan                 | 10158|  9238}}\n{{PH brgy table lite|031402010| Santol                   | 16346| 12465}}\n{{PH brgy table lite|031402011| Wawa (''[[Poblacion]]'') |  4985|  4716}}\n{{PH brgy table lite|bottom|65440}}\n\n==Demographics==\n{{Philippine Census \n| align= none\n| title= Population census of Balagtas\n| 1903 = 8000\n| 1918 = 9875\n| 1939 = 12037\n| 1948 = 8085\n| 1960 = 10280\n| 1970 = 17109\n| 1975 = 21422\n| 1980 = 28654\n| 1990 = 42658\n| 1995 = 49210\n| 2000 = 56945\n| 2007 = 62684\n| 2010 = 65440\n| 2015 = 73929\n| 2020 =\n| 2025 =\n| 2030 =\n| footnote= Source: [[Philippine Statistics Authority]]{{PH census|2015}}{{PH census|2010}}{{PH census|2007}}{{LWUA population data}} \n}}\n\nIn the {{PH wikidata|population_as_of}}, the population of Balagtas, Bulacan, was {{PH wikidata|population_total}} people,{{PH census|current}} with a density of {{convert|{{sigfig|{{PH wikidata|population_total}}/{{PH wikidata|area}}|2}}|PD/km2|disp=or}}.\n\n==Economy==\n;Major Industries\n* Ceramics/Pottery\n* Furniture\n* Garments\n* Gifts/Houseware/Decors\n* Metalcraft\n* Poultry\n;Major Products\n* Furniture/Agricultural Products\n* Balot and Penoy Industry\n* Recruitment Agency\n* Fruit Dealership\n* Tilapia\n* Tricycle Parts\n\n\n;Future Developments\n* Construction of North Food Exchange (under construction)\n* Opening of Balagtas Tollgate\n* Construction of new Balagtas to Baliwag road connection\n\n==Government==\nMunicipal Officials:\n*Mayor: Eladio \"Kap JR.\" Gonzales\n*Vice Mayor: Alberto \"Bobby\" Carating Jr.\n*Councilors:\n** Mikee Jane \"Monay\" Payuran\n** Analyn Jose\n** Fernando K.

He was born in Manitoba, Canada, and died at the age of 82.\n\n==Early life==\nStefansson, born William Stephenson, was born at [[Rural Municipality of Gimli|Arnes, Manitoba]], Canada, in 1879. His parents had emigrated from [[Iceland]] to Manitoba two years earlier. After losing two children during a period of devastating flooding, the family moved to [[North Dakota]] in 1880.\n\nHe was educated at the universities [[University of North Dakota|of North Dakota]] and [[University of Iowa|of Iowa]] ([[Bachelor of Arts|A.B.]], 1903). During his college years, in 1899, he changed his name to Vilhjalmur Stefansson. He studied [[anthropology]] at the graduate school of [[Harvard University]], where for two years he was an instructor.\n\n==Early explorations==\nIn 1904 and 1905, Stefansson did archaeological research in [[Iceland]]. Recruited by [[Ejnar Mikkelsen]] and [[Ernest de Koven Leffingwell]] for their Anglo-American Polar Expedition, he lived with the [[Inuit]] of the [[Mackenzie River|Mackenzie Delta]] during the winter of 1906\u20131907, returning alone across country via the [[Porcupine River|Porcupine]] and [[Yukon River|Yukon]] Rivers. Under the auspices of the [[American Museum of Natural History]], [[New York City|New York]], he and Dr. [[Rudolph Martin Anderson|R. M. Anderson]] undertook the ethnological survey of the Central Arctic coasts of the shores of [[North America]] from 1908 to 1912.\n\nIn 1908, Stefansson made a decision that would affect the rest of his time in Alaska: he hired the [[Inuk]] guide [[Natkusiak]], who would remain with him as his primary guide for the rest of his Alaska expeditions.<ref>[http://pubs.aina.ucalgary.ca/arctic/Arctic45-1-90.pdf Natkusiak (ca. 1885\u20131947)], ''Arctic'' magazine, Vol. 45, No. 1 (March 1992), pp. 90\u201392.</ref> At the time he met Natkusiak, the Inuk guide was working for Capt. [[George Baker Leavitt, Sr.|George B. Leavitt]], a Massachusetts [[whaler|whaling ship]] captain and friend of Stefansson's who sometimes brought the Arctic explorer replenishments of supplies from the American Museum of Natural History.<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=AE_P_XngIi0C&pg=PA48&lpg=PA48&dq=%22george+leavitt%22+narwhal&source=bl&ots=RulYvQQUSn&sig=VkQqCn5gK9RK6Rb4yRswvfvBCqA&hl=en&sa=X&oi=book_result&resnum=9&ct=result ''My Life with the Eskimo''], Vilhjalmur Stefansson, Reissued by Kessinger Publishing, 2004. {{ISBN|1-4179-2395-4}}</ref>\n\n[[Christian Klengenberg]] is first credited to have introduced the term \"[[Blond Eskimos|Blonde Eskimo]]\" to Stefansson just before Stefansson's visit to the Inuit inhabiting southwestern [[Victoria Island (Canada)|Victoria Island]], Canada, in 1910.

Newspapers subsequently popularised the term \"Blonde Eskimo\", which caught more readers' attention despite Stefansson's preference for the term Copper Inuit. Stefansson later referenced Greely's work in his writings and the term \"Blonde Eskimo\" became applied to sightings of light haired [[Eskimo]]s from as early as the 17th century.<ref>''My Life with the Eskimo'', 1922, p. 199 (reprinted by Kessinger Publishing, 2004).</ref>\n\n==Loss of the ''Karluk'' and rescue of survivors==\n{{Further|Voyage of the Karluk}}\nStefansson organized and directed the [[Canadian Arctic Expedition 1913\u20131916]] to explore the regions west of [[Queen Elizabeth Islands|Parry Archipelago]] for the [[Government of Canada]]. Three ships, the ''[[HMCS Karluk|Karluk]]'', the ''Mary Sachs'', and the ''Alaska'' were employed.\n\nStefansson left the main ship, the ''Karluk'', when it became stuck in the ice in August/September 1913. Stefansson's explanation was that he and five other expedition members left to go hunting to provide fresh meat for the crew. However, William Laird McKinley and others left on the ship suspected that he left deliberately, anticipating that the ship would be carried off by moving ice, as indeed happened. The ship, with Captain [[Robert Bartlett (explorer)|Robert Bartlett]] of Newfoundland and 24 other expedition members aboard, drifted westward with the ice and was eventually crushed. It sank on January 11, 1914. Four men made their way to [[Herald Island (Arctic)|Herald Island]], but died there, possibly from carbon monoxide poisoning, before they could be rescued. Four other men, including [[Alistair Mackay]] who had been part of the Sir [[Ernest Shackleton]]'s [[British Antarctic Expedition, 1907\u201309|British Antarctic Expedition]], tried reaching [[Wrangel Island]] on their own but perished. The remaining members of the expedition, under command of Captain Bartlett, made their way to Wrangel Island where three died. Bartlett and his Inuk hunter Kataktovik made their way across sea ice to Siberia to get help. Remaining survivors were picked up by the American fishing [[schooner]] [[King & Winge (fishing schooner)|''King & Winge'']] and the [[United States Revenue Cutter Service]] [[Revenue cutter|cutter]] {{USRC|Bear}}.<ref>Newell, Gordon R., ed., ''H.W. McCurdy Maritime History of the Pacific Northwest'', at 242, Superior Publishing, Seattle, Washington, 1966.</ref>\n\nStefansson resumed his explorations by [[sledge]] over the [[Arctic Ocean]], here known as the [[Beaufort Sea]], leaving [[Collinson Point, Alaska|Collinson Point]], [[Alaska]] in April, 1914. A supporting sledge turned back {{convert|75|mi|abbr=on}} offshore, but he and two men continued onward on one sledge, living largely by his rifle on polar game for 96 days until his party reached the ''Mary Sachs'' in the autumn. Stefansson continued exploring until 1918.\n\n==Wrangel Island fiasco==\nIn 1921, he encouraged and planned an expedition for four young men to colonise [[Wrangel Island]] north of [[Siberia]], where the eleven survivors of the 22 men on the ''Karluk'' had lived from March to September 1914. Stefansson had designs for forming an exploration company that would be geared towards individuals interested in touring the Arctic island.\n\nStefansson originally wanted to claim Wrangel Island for the Canadian government. However, due to the dangerous outcome from his initial trip to the island, the government refused to assist with the expedition. He then wanted to claim the land for [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland|Britain]] but the British government rejected this claim when it was made by the young men. The raising of the British flag on Wrangel Island, an acknowledged [[Russia]]n territory, caused an international incident.\n\nThe four young men, Frederick Maurer, E. Lorne Knight, and Milton Galle from the US, and Allan Crawford of Canada, were inexperienced and ill-equipped for the trip. All perished on the island or in an attempt to get help from Siberia across the frozen [[Chukchi Sea]]. The only survivors were an Inuk woman, [[Ada Blackjack]], whom the men had hired as a seamstress in [[Nome, Alaska]], and taken with them, and the expedition's cat, Vic. Ada Blackjack had taught herself survival skills and cared for the last man on the island, E. Lorne Knight, until he died of [[scurvy]]. Blackjack was rescued in 1923 after two years on Wrangel Island. Stefansson drew the ire of the public and the families for having sent such ill-equipped young men to Wrangel. His reputation was severely tainted by this disaster and that of the ''Karluk''.\n\n==Discoveries==\nStefansson's discoveries included new land (such as [[Brock Island|Brock]], [[Mackenzie King Island|Mackenzie King]], [[Borden Island|Borden]], [[Meighen Island|Meighen]], and [[Lougheed Island]]s)<ref name=Stefansson>{{cite book\n  | last = Stefansson\n  | first = Vilhjalmur\n  | title = The Friendly Arctic: The Story of Five Years in Polar Regions\n  | publisher = Macmillan\n  | year = 1922\n  | location = New York\n| url =https://archive.org/details/friendlyarctics01stefgoog}}</ref> and the edge of the [[continental shelf]]. His journeys and successes are among the marvels of [[Arctic exploration]]. He extended the discoveries of [[Francis Leopold McClintock]]. From April 1914 to June 1915 he lived on the [[Drift ice|ice pack]]. Stefansson continued his explorations leaving from [[Herschel Island]] on August 23, 1915.\n\nOn January 30, 1920, ''The Pioche Record'' reported that Icelandic explorer Vilhjalmur Stefansson discovered a lost cache from the [[McClintock Arctic expedition|1853 McClintock expedition]] on [[Melville Island (Northwest Territories and Nunavut)|Melville Island]]. Clothing and food from the cache was in excellent condition despite the harsh arctic conditions.{{sfn|''The Pioche Record'', January 30,|1920|p=3}}\n\nIn 1921, he was awarded the [[Gold Medal (RGS)|Founder's Gold Medal]] of the [[Royal Geographical Society]] for his explorations of the Arctic.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rgs.org/NR/rdonlyres/C5962519-882A-4C67-803D-0037308C756D/0/GoldMedallists18322011.pdf| title=List of Past Gold Medal Winners|publisher= Royal Geographical Society|accessdate = 24 August 2015}}</ref>\n\n==Later career==\nStefansson remained a well-known explorer for the rest of his life. Late in life, through his affiliation with [[Dartmouth College]] (he was Director of Polar Studies), he became a major figure in the establishment of the [[United States Army|US Army]]'s [[Cold Regions Research and Engineering Laboratory]] (CRREL) in [[Hanover, New Hampshire|Hanover]], [[New Hampshire]]. CRREL-supported research, often conducted in winter on the forbidding summit of [[Mount Washington (New Hampshire)|Mount Washington]], has been key to developing mat\u00e9riel and doctrine to support alpine conflict.\n\nStefansson joined [[the Explorers Club]] in 1908, four years after its founding. He later served as Club President twice: 1919\u20131922 and 1937\u20131939. In the all-male Club, the Board drew attention under Stefansson's reign when it put forth an amendment to its bylaws that read in 1938, \"A Woman's Roll of Honor shall be instituted to which the Board of Directors may name women of the United States and Canada in recognition of the noteworthy achievements and writings in the field of the Club's interests, primarily exploration.\"<ref name=\"Minutes 1938\">Minutes, Explorer's Club, 4 January 1938.</ref> Perhaps to comfort fellow members, the article added, \"This Woman's Roll of Honor shall be quite outside the Club's organisation but shall correspond in dignity to the Honorary Class of (male) members within it.\"<ref name=\"Minutes 1938\" /> His continued support of women in anthropology is demonstrated in his 1939\u20131941 mentorship of [[Gitel Steed]] as she undertook research on diet and subsistence for his two-volume ''Lives of the Hunters'', from which she began a dissertation on hunter-gatherer.\n\nWhile living in New York City, Stefansson was one of the regulars at [[Romany Marie]]'s [[Greenwich Village]] [[caf\u00e9]]s.<ref name=\"Biography\">Robert Shulman.

One of the organisations prominent in this campaign was the [[Organization for Jewish Colonization in Russia|American Committee for the Settlement of Jews in Birobidjan]], or Ambijan, formed in 1934. A tireless proponent of settlement in Birobidzhan, Stefansson appeared at countless Ambijan meetings, dinners, and rallies, and proved an invaluable resource. Ambijan produced a 50-page Year Book at the end of 1936, full of testimonials and letters of support. Among these was one from Stefansson, who was now also listed as a member of Ambijan's Board of Directors and Governors: \"The Birobidjan project seems to me to offer a most statesmanlike contribution to the problem of the rehabilitation of eastern and central European Jewry,\" he wrote.\n\nAmbijan's national conference in New York, November 25\u201326, 1944, pledged to raise $1 million to support refugees in [[Volgograd|Stalingrad]] and Birobidzhan. Prominent guests and speakers included New York Congressman [[Emanuel Celler]], Senator [[Elbert D. Thomas]] of [[Utah]], and Soviet ambassador [[Andrei Gromyko]]. A public dinner, attended by the delegates and their guests, was hosted by Vilhjalmur and spouse Evelyn Stefansson. Vilhjalmur was selected as one of two vice-presidents of the organisation.\n\nBut with the growing anti-Russian feeling in the country after [[World War II]], \"expos\u00e9s\" of Stefansson began to appear in the press. In August 1951, he was denounced as a [[Communism|Communist]] before a [[United States Senate Subcommittee on Internal Security|Senate Internal Security subcommittee]] by [[Louis F. Budenz]], a Communist-turned-Catholic. Perhaps Stefansson himself had by then some second thoughts about Ambijan, for his posthumously published autobiography made no mention of his work on its behalf. Nor, for that matter, did his otherwise very complete obituary in ''[[The New York Times]]'' of August 27, 1962.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Srebrnik | first1 = Henry | year = 1998 | title = The Radical 'Second Life' of Vilhjalmur Stefansson | url = | journal = Arctic | volume = 51 | issue = 1| pages = 58\u201360 | doi=10.14430/arctic1046}}</ref>\n\n==Advocacy of an exclusively meat diet==\nStefansson is also a figure of considerable interest in [[diet (nutrition)|diet]]ary circles, especially those with an interest in very [[low-carbohydrate diet]]s. Stefansson documented the fact that the [[Inuit diet]] consisted of about 90% meat and fish; Inuit would often go 6 to 9 months a year eating nothing but meat and fish\u2014what might nowadays be perceived to be a 'zerocarb' / [[no-carbohydrate diet]]. (The diet technically contains a very low amount of carbohydates as the fresh fish that the Inuit ate would have contained a small amount of glycogen.) He found that he and his fellow explorers of European, Negro, and South Sea Islands descent were also perfectly healthy on such a diet. \n\nSome years after his first experience with the Inuit (known as Eskimos in Stefansson's time), Dr. Stefansson returned to the Arctic with a colleague, Dr. Karsten Anderson, to carry out research for the American Museum of Natural History. They were supplied with every necessity including a year's supply of 'civilised' food. This they declined, electing instead to live off the land. In the end, the one-year project stretched to four years, during which time the two men ate only the meat they could kill and the fish they could catch in the Canadian Arctic. Neither of the two men suffered any adverse after-effects from their four-year experiment. It was evident to Stefansson, as it had been to [[William Banting]], that the body could function perfectly well, remain healthy, vigorous and slender if it used a diet in which as much food was eaten as the body required, only carbohydrate was restricted and the total number of calories was ignored.<ref name=\"Groves\">{{Cite web|url=http://www.second-opinions.co.uk/banting.html|title=WILLIAM BANTING: The Father of the Low-Carbohydrate Diet|last=Groves, PhD|first=Barry|year=2002|publisher=Second Opinions|accessdate=26 December 2007}}</ref>\n\nWhile there was considerable skepticism when Stefansson reported his findings about the viability of an exclusively meat diet, his claims have been borne out in later studies and analyses.<ref>Fediuk, Karen. 2000 [http://members.shaw.ca/karen.fediuk/VitaminCintheInuitdiet.pdf Vitamin C in the Inuit diet: past and present].

But unlike the pathology of diabetes, in this particular study, glucosuria was present in Anderson for 4 days and coincided only with the giving of a 100 gm of glucose for a tolerance test and with the first 3 days of his pneumonia, where he received fluids and a diet rich in carbohydrate.

Whereas Stefansson's prior experience was that lean meat would lead to illness after the second or third fatless week, Stefansson developed nausea and diarrhea on the third day at Bellevue.  Stefansson attributes the fast onset of illness due to the usually lean meat that he was served versus the fattier caribou meat he consumed previously.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.biblelife.org/stefansson2.htm|title=Adventures in Diet Part 2 (Harper's Monthly Magazine)|last=Stefansson|first=Vilhjalmur|date=December 1935}}</ref>  After eating fatty meat, he fully recovered in two days.

He was born in Manitoba, Canada, and died at the age of 82.\n\n==Early life==\nStefansson, born William Stephenson, was born at [[Rural Municipality of Gimli|Arnes, Manitoba]], Canada, in 1879. His parents had emigrated from [[Iceland]] to Manitoba two years earlier. After losing two children during a period of devastating flooding, the family moved to [[North Dakota]] in 1880.\n\nHe was educated at the universities [[University of North Dakota|of North Dakota]] and [[University of Iowa|of Iowa]] ([[Bachelor of Arts|A.B.]], 1903). During his college years, in 1899, he changed his name to Vilhjalmur Stefansson. He studied [[anthropology]] at the graduate school of [[Harvard University]], where for two years he was an instructor.\n\n==Early explorations==\nIn 1904 and 1905, Stefansson did archaeological research in [[Iceland]]. Recruited by [[Ejnar Mikkelsen]] and [[Ernest de Koven Leffingwell]] for their Anglo-American Polar Expedition, he lived with the [[Inuit]] of the [[Mackenzie River|Mackenzie Delta]] during the winter of 1906\u20131907, returning alone across country via the [[Porcupine River|Porcupine]] and [[Yukon River|Yukon]] Rivers. Under the auspices of the [[American Museum of Natural History]], [[New York City|New York]], he and Dr. [[Rudolph Martin Anderson|R. M. Anderson]] undertook the ethnological survey of the Central Arctic coasts of the shores of [[North America]] from 1908 to 1912.\n\nIn 1908, Stefansson made a decision that would affect the rest of his time in Alaska: he hired the [[Inuk]] guide [[Natkusiak]], who would remain with him as his primary guide for the rest of his Alaska expeditions.<ref>[http://pubs.aina.ucalgary.ca/arctic/Arctic45-1-90.pdf Natkusiak (ca. 1885\u20131947)], ''Arctic'' magazine, Vol. 45, No. 1 (March 1992), pp. 90\u201392.</ref> At the time he met Natkusiak, the Inuk guide was working for Capt. [[George Baker Leavitt, Sr.|George B. Leavitt]], a Massachusetts [[whaler|whaling ship]] captain and friend of Stefansson's who sometimes brought the Arctic explorer replenishments of supplies from the American Museum of Natural History.<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=AE_P_XngIi0C&pg=PA48&lpg=PA48&dq=%22george+leavitt%22+narwhal&source=bl&ots=RulYvQQUSn&sig=VkQqCn5gK9RK6Rb4yRswvfvBCqA&hl=en&sa=X&oi=book_result&resnum=9&ct=result ''My Life with the Eskimo''], Vilhjalmur Stefansson, Reissued by Kessinger Publishing, 2004. {{ISBN|1-4179-2395-4}}</ref>\n\n[[Christian Klengenberg]] is first credited to have introduced the term \"[[Blond Eskimos|Blonde Eskimo]]\" to Stefansson just before Stefansson's visit to the Inuit inhabiting southwestern [[Victoria Island (Canada)|Victoria Island]], Canada, in 1910.

H.}}</ref> [[Adolphus Greely]] in 1912 first compiled the sightings recorded in earlier literature of blonde or fair haired Arctic natives and in 1912 published them in the ''[[National Geographic Magazine]]'' entitled \"The Origin of Stefansson's Blonde Eskimo\". Newspapers subsequently popularised the term \"Blonde Eskimo\", which caught more readers' attention despite Stefansson's preference for the term Copper Inuit. Stefansson later referenced Greely's work in his writings and the term \"Blonde Eskimo\" became applied to sightings of light haired [[Eskimo]]s from as early as the 17th century.<ref>''My Life with the Eskimo'', 1922, p. 199 (reprinted by Kessinger Publishing, 2004).</ref>\n\n==Loss of the ''Karluk'' and rescue of survivors==\n{{Further|Voyage of the Karluk}}\nStefansson organized and directed the [[Canadian Arctic Expedition 1913\u20131916]] to explore the regions west of [[Queen Elizabeth Islands|Parry Archipelago]] for the [[Government of Canada]]. Three ships, the ''[[HMCS Karluk|Karluk]]'', the ''Mary Sachs'', and the ''Alaska'' were employed.\n\nStefansson left the main ship, the ''Karluk'', when it became stuck in the ice in August/September 1913. Stefansson's explanation was that he and five other expedition members left to go hunting to provide fresh meat for the crew. However, William Laird McKinley and others left on the ship suspected that he left deliberately, anticipating that the ship would be carried off by moving ice, as indeed happened. The ship, with Captain [[Robert Bartlett (explorer)|Robert Bartlett]] of Newfoundland and 24 other expedition members aboard, drifted westward with the ice and was eventually crushed. It sank on January 11, 1914. Four men made their way to [[Herald Island (Arctic)|Herald Island]], but died there, possibly from carbon monoxide poisoning, before they could be rescued. Four other men, including [[Alistair Mackay]] who had been part of the Sir [[Ernest Shackleton]]'s [[British Antarctic Expedition, 1907\u201309|British Antarctic Expedition]], tried reaching [[Wrangel Island]] on their own but perished. The remaining members of the expedition, under command of Captain Bartlett, made their way to Wrangel Island where three died. Bartlett and his Inuk hunter Kataktovik made their way across sea ice to Siberia to get help. Remaining survivors were picked up by the American fishing [[schooner]] [[King & Winge (fishing schooner)|''King & Winge'']] and the [[United States Revenue Cutter Service]] [[Revenue cutter|cutter]] {{USRC|Bear}}.<ref>Newell, Gordon R., ed., ''H.W. McCurdy Maritime History of the Pacific Northwest'', at 242, Superior Publishing, Seattle, Washington, 1966.</ref>\n\nStefansson resumed his explorations by [[sledge]] over the [[Arctic Ocean]], here known as the [[Beaufort Sea]], leaving [[Collinson Point, Alaska|Collinson Point]], [[Alaska]] in April, 1914. A supporting sledge turned back {{convert|75|mi|abbr=on}} offshore, but he and two men continued onward on one sledge, living largely by his rifle on polar game for 96 days until his party reached the ''Mary Sachs'' in the autumn. Stefansson continued exploring until 1918.\n\n==Wrangel Island fiasco==\nIn 1921, he encouraged and planned an expedition for four young men to colonise [[Wrangel Island]] north of [[Siberia]], where the eleven survivors of the 22 men on the ''Karluk'' had lived from March to September 1914. Stefansson had designs for forming an exploration company that would be geared towards individuals interested in touring the Arctic island.\n\nStefansson originally wanted to claim Wrangel Island for the Canadian government. However, due to the dangerous outcome from his initial trip to the island, the government refused to assist with the expedition. He then wanted to claim the land for [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland|Britain]] but the British government rejected this claim when it was made by the young men. The raising of the British flag on Wrangel Island, an acknowledged [[Russia]]n territory, caused an international incident.\n\nThe four young men, Frederick Maurer, E. Lorne Knight, and Milton Galle from the US, and Allan Crawford of Canada, were inexperienced and ill-equipped for the trip. All perished on the island or in an attempt to get help from Siberia across the frozen [[Chukchi Sea]]. The only survivors were an Inuk woman, [[Ada Blackjack]], whom the men had hired as a seamstress in [[Nome, Alaska]], and taken with them, and the expedition's cat, Vic. Ada Blackjack had taught herself survival skills and cared for the last man on the island, E. Lorne Knight, until he died of [[scurvy]]. Blackjack was rescued in 1923 after two years on Wrangel Island. Stefansson drew the ire of the public and the families for having sent such ill-equipped young men to Wrangel. His reputation was severely tainted by this disaster and that of the ''Karluk''.\n\n==Discoveries==\nStefansson's discoveries included new land (such as [[Brock Island|Brock]], [[Mackenzie King Island|Mackenzie King]], [[Borden Island|Borden]], [[Meighen Island|Meighen]], and [[Lougheed Island]]s)<ref name=Stefansson>{{cite book\n  | last = Stefansson\n  | first = Vilhjalmur\n  | title = The Friendly Arctic: The Story of Five Years in Polar Regions\n  | publisher = Macmillan\n  | year = 1922\n  | location = New York\n| url =https://archive.org/details/friendlyarctics01stefgoog}}</ref> and the edge of the [[continental shelf]]. His journeys and successes are among the marvels of [[Arctic exploration]]. He extended the discoveries of [[Francis Leopold McClintock]]. From April 1914 to June 1915 he lived on the [[Drift ice|ice pack]]. Stefansson continued his explorations leaving from [[Herschel Island]] on August 23, 1915.\n\nOn January 30, 1920, ''The Pioche Record'' reported that Icelandic explorer Vilhjalmur Stefansson discovered a lost cache from the [[McClintock Arctic expedition|1853 McClintock expedition]] on [[Melville Island (Northwest Territories and Nunavut)|Melville Island]]. Clothing and food from the cache was in excellent condition despite the harsh arctic conditions.{{sfn|''The Pioche Record'', January 30,|1920|p=3}}\n\nIn 1921, he was awarded the [[Gold Medal (RGS)|Founder's Gold Medal]] of the [[Royal Geographical Society]] for his explorations of the Arctic.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rgs.org/NR/rdonlyres/C5962519-882A-4C67-803D-0037308C756D/0/GoldMedallists18322011.pdf| title=List of Past Gold Medal Winners|publisher= Royal Geographical Society|accessdate = 24 August 2015}}</ref>\n\n==Later career==\nStefansson remained a well-known explorer for the rest of his life. Late in life, through his affiliation with [[Dartmouth College]] (he was Director of Polar Studies), he became a major figure in the establishment of the [[United States Army|US Army]]'s [[Cold Regions Research and Engineering Laboratory]] (CRREL) in [[Hanover, New Hampshire|Hanover]], [[New Hampshire]]. CRREL-supported research, often conducted in winter on the forbidding summit of [[Mount Washington (New Hampshire)|Mount Washington]], has been key to developing mat\u00e9riel and doctrine to support alpine conflict.\n\nStefansson joined [[the Explorers Club]] in 1908, four years after its founding. He later served as Club President twice: 1919\u20131922 and 1937\u20131939. In the all-male Club, the Board drew attention under Stefansson's reign when it put forth an amendment to its bylaws that read in 1938, \"A Woman's Roll of Honor shall be instituted to which the Board of Directors may name women of the United States and Canada in recognition of the noteworthy achievements and writings in the field of the Club's interests, primarily exploration.\"<ref name=\"Minutes 1938\">Minutes, Explorer's Club, 4 January 1938.</ref> Perhaps to comfort fellow members, the article added, \"This Woman's Roll of Honor shall be quite outside the Club's organisation but shall correspond in dignity to the Honorary Class of (male) members within it.\"<ref name=\"Minutes 1938\" /> His continued support of women in anthropology is demonstrated in his 1939\u20131941 mentorship of [[Gitel Steed]] as she undertook research on diet and subsistence for his two-volume ''Lives of the Hunters'', from which she began a dissertation on hunter-gatherer.\n\nWhile living in New York City, Stefansson was one of the regulars at [[Romany Marie]]'s [[Greenwich Village]] [[caf\u00e9]]s.<ref name=\"Biography\">Robert Shulman.

One of the organisations prominent in this campaign was the [[Organization for Jewish Colonization in Russia|American Committee for the Settlement of Jews in Birobidjan]], or Ambijan, formed in 1934. A tireless proponent of settlement in Birobidzhan, Stefansson appeared at countless Ambijan meetings, dinners, and rallies, and proved an invaluable resource. Ambijan produced a 50-page Year Book at the end of 1936, full of testimonials and letters of support. Among these was one from Stefansson, who was now also listed as a member of Ambijan's Board of Directors and Governors: \"The Birobidjan project seems to me to offer a most statesmanlike contribution to the problem of the rehabilitation of eastern and central European Jewry,\" he wrote.\n\nAmbijan's national conference in New York, November 25\u201326, 1944, pledged to raise $1 million to support refugees in [[Volgograd|Stalingrad]] and Birobidzhan. Prominent guests and speakers included New York Congressman [[Emanuel Celler]], Senator [[Elbert D. Thomas]] of [[Utah]], and Soviet ambassador [[Andrei Gromyko]]. A public dinner, attended by the delegates and their guests, was hosted by Vilhjalmur and spouse Evelyn Stefansson. Vilhjalmur was selected as one of two vice-presidents of the organisation.\n\nBut with the growing anti-Russian feeling in the country after [[World War II]], \"expos\u00e9s\" of Stefansson began to appear in the press. In August 1951, he was denounced as a [[Communism|Communist]] before a [[United States Senate Subcommittee on Internal Security|Senate Internal Security subcommittee]] by [[Louis F. Budenz]], a Communist-turned-Catholic. Perhaps Stefansson himself had by then some second thoughts about Ambijan, for his posthumously published autobiography made no mention of his work on its behalf. Nor, for that matter, did his otherwise very complete obituary in ''[[The New York Times]]'' of August 27, 1962.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Srebrnik | first1 = Henry | year = 1998 | title = The Radical 'Second Life' of Vilhjalmur Stefansson | url = | journal = Arctic | volume = 51 | issue = 1| pages = 58\u201360 | doi=10.14430/arctic1046}}</ref>\n\n==Advocacy of an exclusively meat diet==\nStefansson is also a figure of considerable interest in [[diet (nutrition)|diet]]ary circles, especially those with an interest in very [[low-carbohydrate diet]]s. Stefansson documented the fact that the [[Inuit diet]] consisted of about 90% meat and fish; Inuit would often go 6 to 9 months a year eating nothing but meat and fish\u2014what might nowadays be perceived to be a 'zerocarb' / [[no-carbohydrate diet]]. (The diet technically contains a very low amount of carbohydates as the fresh fish that the Inuit ate would have contained a small amount of glycogen.) He found that he and his fellow explorers of European, Negro, and South Sea Islands descent were also perfectly healthy on such a diet. \n\nSome years after his first experience with the Inuit (known as Eskimos in Stefansson's time), Dr. Stefansson returned to the Arctic with a colleague, Dr. Karsten Anderson, to carry out research for the American Museum of Natural History. They were supplied with every necessity including a year's supply of 'civilised' food. This they declined, electing instead to live off the land. In the end, the one-year project stretched to four years, during which time the two men ate only the meat they could kill and the fish they could catch in the Canadian Arctic. Neither of the two men suffered any adverse after-effects from their four-year experiment. It was evident to Stefansson, as it had been to [[William Banting]], that the body could function perfectly well, remain healthy, vigorous and slender if it used a diet in which as much food was eaten as the body required, only carbohydrate was restricted and the total number of calories was ignored.<ref name=\"Groves\">{{Cite web|url=http://www.second-opinions.co.uk/banting.html|title=WILLIAM BANTING: The Father of the Low-Carbohydrate Diet|last=Groves, PhD|first=Barry|year=2002|publisher=Second Opinions|accessdate=26 December 2007}}</ref>\n\nWhile there was considerable skepticism when Stefansson reported his findings about the viability of an exclusively meat diet, his claims have been borne out in later studies and analyses.<ref>Fediuk, Karen. 2000 [http://members.shaw.ca/karen.fediuk/VitaminCintheInuitdiet.pdf Vitamin C in the Inuit diet: past and present].

Retrieved on: December 8, 2007.</ref> In multiple studies, it was shown that the [[Inuit diet]] was a [[ketogenic diet]].  While the Inuit diet derived a percentage of its calories from the [[glycogen]] found in the [[raw meat]]s, the native Inuit ate a diet of primarily stewed (boiled) fish and meats while occasionally eating raw fish.<ref>{{cite journal | author = Peter Heinbecker | year = 1928 | title = Studies on the Metabolism of Eskimos | url = http://www.jbc.org/content/80/2/461 | format = PDF | journal = J.

For the rest of an entire year, paid observers followed them to ensure dietary compliance.  The book ''The Unseen Power: Public Relations'' states that [[Pendleton Dudley|Pendelton Dudley]], once considered the \"dean of public relations\", convinced the [[American Meat Institute]] to fund this study.<ref>{{cite book|title=The Unseen Power: Public Relations|last=Cutlip|first=Scott|publisher=Routledge|year=1994|isbn=0805814655|location=London|pages=101|accessdate=}}</ref>\n\nThe results were published, and Anderson had developed [[glycosuria]] during this time, which is normally associated with untreated diabetes.  But unlike the pathology of diabetes, in this particular study, glucosuria was present in Anderson for 4 days and coincided only with the giving of a 100 gm of glucose for a tolerance test and with the first 3 days of his pneumonia, where he received fluids and a diet rich in carbohydrate. Once that situation resolved, the glucosuria disappeared.<ref name=\"McClellanDuBois1930\">{{cite journal|url=http://www.jbc.org/content/83/3/747.full.pdf|title=THE EFFECT OF AN EXCLUSIVE MEAT DIET LASTING ONE YEAR ON THE CARBOHYDRATE TOLERANCE OF TWO NORMAL MEN.|last=Tolstoi|first=Edward|date=June 20, 1929|pages=747\u2013752|accessdate=2015-12-16|journal=J.

Stefansson noted that in the North, very lean meat sometimes produced \"digestive disturbances\".  Whereas Stefansson's prior experience was that lean meat would lead to illness after the second or third fatless week, Stefansson developed nausea and diarrhea on the third day at Bellevue.  Stefansson attributes the fast onset of illness due to the usually lean meat that he was served versus the fattier caribou meat he consumed previously.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.biblelife.org/stefansson2.htm|title=Adventures in Diet Part 2 (Harper's Monthly Magazine)|last=Stefansson|first=Vilhjalmur|date=December 1935}}</ref>  After eating fatty meat, he fully recovered in two days.

During the next 2 days he took much less protein and more fat so that he received about 20 percent of his calories from protein and 80 percent from fat. In these two days his intestinal condition became normal without medication. Thereafter the protein calories did not exceed 25 per cent of the total for more than 1 day at a time.\u201d}}</ref>\n\nThere were no deficiency problems; the two men remained perfectly healthy; their bowels remained normal, except that their stools were smaller and did not smell. Stefansson's [[gingivitis]] disappeared by the end of the experiment although there was an increase in the deposit of tartar on his teeth.  During this experiment his intake had varied between 2,000 and 3,100 calories per day and he derived, by choice, an average of almost eighty percent of his energy from animal fat and almost twenty percent from protein.<ref name=\"Groves\" />  Daily intake varied from 100-140 grams of protein, 200-300 grams of fat, and 7-12 grams of carbohydrates.\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n*{{cite news |ref={{SfnRef|''The Pioche Record'', January 30,|1920}}|date= January 30, 1920|title= 50 Year Old Cache Found|url=https://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/lccn/sn86091349/1920-01-30/ed-1/seq-3/|newspaper=The Pioche Record|publisher=L.H.

27 July 1915 \u2013 20 May 1961) was a German military aviator and [[wing commander (rank)|wing commander]] in the [[Luftwaffe]] during [[World War II]]. As a [[fighter ace]], he was credited with 101 enemy aircraft shot down in 307 combat missions. All of his victories were claimed over the [[Western Front (World War II)|Western Front]], including 11 four-engine bombers and at least 68 [[Supermarine Spitfire]] fighters.\n\nPriller joined the military service in the [[Wehrmacht]] of [[Nazi Germany]] in 1935. Initially serving in the [[German Army (Wehrmacht)|Army]], he transferred to the Luftwaffe (Air Force) in 1936. Following flight training, he was posted to ''Jagdgeschwader'' 334 (JG&nbsp;334\u2014334th Fighter Wing) and then to [[Jagdgeschwader 51|''Jagdgeschwader'' 51]] (JG&nbsp;51\u201451st Fighter Wing) on 1 May 1939. On 1 September 1939, the day when Germany invaded Poland, he was appointed Squadron Leader of the 6th Squadron of JG 51. He flew in the [[Battle of France]] and claimed his first aerial victory on 28 May 1940. He received the [[Knight's Cross of the Iron Cross]] in October 1940 following his 20th aerial victory which he claimed during the [[Battle of Britain]].\n\nIn November 1940, Priller was transferred to [[Jagdgeschwader 26|''Jagdgeschwader'' 26]] \"Schlageter\" (JG&nbsp;26\u201426th Fighter Wing) and was given command of the 1st Squadron. In June and July 1941 he accounted for a further 20 victories, earning him the [[Knight's Cross of the Iron Cross with Oak Leaves]] on 19 October 1941. Priller was appointed Group Commander of the III. ''Gruppe'' of JG&nbsp;26 \"Schlageter\" on 6 December 1941. He claimed his 70th victory on 5 May 1942. Priller became Wing Commander of JG 26 \"Schlageter\" on 11 January 1943. During the [[Allies of World War II|Allied]] [[Invasion of Normandy]] on 6 June 1944 he flew one of the few Luftwaffe missions against the Allied beachhead that day. Priller claimed his 100th victory on 15 June 1944. For this achievement he was awarded the [[Knight's Cross of the Iron Cross with Oak Leaves and Swords]]. During [[Operation Bodenplatte]] on 1 January 1945, Priller led an attack on the Allied airfields at [[Brussels]]-[[Evere]] and Brussels-[[Grimbergen]]. On 31 January 1945 Priller was appointed ''Inspekteur der Jagdflieger West'' (Inspector of Fighter Pilots West) and ceased operational flying. He held this position until the end of the war in May 1945.\n\nFollowing the war, Priller managed the family brewery business. He died in 1961.\n\n==Early life and career==\nPriller, who was nicknamed ''Pips'' since his early youth, was born on 27 July 1915 in [[Ingolstadt]] in the [[Kingdom of Bavaria]], a state of the [[German Empire]]. After he graduated with his ''[[Abitur]]'' (diploma) he joined the military service of the [[Wehrmacht]] as a ''[[Fahnenjunker]]'' (officer candidate) with ''Infantry-Regiment'' 20 in [[Amberg]] of the [[10th Infantry Division (Wehrmacht)|10th Infantry Division]] on 1 April 1935. Against the will of his battalion commander he transferred to the [[Luftwaffe]] as a ''[[Oberf\u00e4hnrich]]'' (officer cadet) on 1 October 1936.{{sfn|Goss|2018|pp=142\u2013143}} He then received flight training at the pilot school in [[Salzwedel]]].{{Refn|Flight training in the Luftwaffe progressed through the levels A1, A2 and B1, B2, referred to as A/B flight training. A training included theoretical and practical training in aerobatics, navigation, long-distance flights and dead-stick landings. The B courses included high-altitude flights, instrument flights, night landings and training to handle the aircraft in difficult situations. For pilots destined to fly multi-engine aircraft, the training was completed with the Luftwaffe Advanced Pilot's Certificate (''Erweiterter Luftwaffen-Flugzeugf\u00fchrerschein''), also known as the C-Certificate.{{sfn|Bergstr\u00f6m|Antipov|Sundin|2003|p=17}}|group=\"Note\"}}.

''Gruppe'', heading for the area west of Caen and encountered the USAAF heavy bombers just as they were crossing the French coast. Avoiding the escort fighters, Priller attacked the first [[combat box]] of about twenty B-24 bombers from the front.
