The film was directed by [[Chris Sanders]] and [[Dean DeBlois]] from a screenplay by [[William Davies (screenwriter)|Will Davies]], Sanders, and DeBlois, and stars the voices of [[Jay Baruchel]], [[Gerard Butler]], [[Craig Ferguson]], [[America Ferrera]], [[Jonah Hill]], [[Christopher Mintz-Plasse]], [[T.J. Miller]], and [[Kristen Wiig]]. The story takes place in a mythical [[Vikings|Viking]] world where a young Viking teenager named Hiccup aspires to follow his tribe's tradition of becoming a [[dragon]] slayer. After finally capturing his first dragon, and with his chance at last of gaining the tribe's acceptance, he finds that he no longer wants to kill the dragon and instead befriends it.\n\nThe film premiered at the [[Universal Amphitheater|Gibson Amphitheater]] on March 21, 2010,<ref name=\"HTTYDPremiere\" /> and was released in the United States five days later on March 26. The film was a critical and commercial success, earning praise from film critics and audiences and earning nearly $500 million worldwide. It was nominated for the [[Academy Award for Best Animated Feature]] and [[Academy Award for Best Original Score|Best Original Score]] at the [[83rd Academy Awards]], but lost to ''[[Toy Story 3]]'' and ''[[The Social Network]]'', respectively. ''How to Train Your Dragon'' also won ten [[Annie Awards]], including [[Annie Award for Best Animated Feature|Best Animated Feature]].\n\nTwo sequels, ''[[How to Train Your Dragon 2]]'' and ''[[How to Train Your Dragon: The Hidden World]]'', were released on June 13, 2014, and February 22, 2019, respectively. Much like their predecessor, both sequels were widely praised and became box office successes. The film's success has also inspired other merchandise, including a [[How to Train Your Dragon (video game)|video game]] and a [[DreamWorks Dragons|television series]].\n\n== Plot ==\nThe [[Vikings|Viking]] village of Berk, located on a remote island, is attacked frequently by dragons, which take livestock and damage property. Hiccup, the awkward fifteen-year-old son of the village chieftain, Stoick the Vast, is deemed too scrawny and weak to fight the dragons, so he instead creates mechanical devices under his apprenticeship with Gobber, the village blacksmith, though Hiccup's inventions often backfire. During one attack, Hiccup uses a [[bolas]] launcher to shoot down a Night Fury, a dangerous and rare dragon of which little is known, but no one believes him, so he searches for the fallen dragon on his own. He finds the dragon in the forest, tangled in his net, but cannot bring himself to kill it, and instead sets it free.\n\nStoick assembles a fleet to find the dragons' nest, and enters Hiccup in a dragon-fighting class taught by Gobber with the other teenagers, Fishlegs, Snotlout, Ruffnut, Tuffnut, and Astrid, a tough Viking girl on whom Hiccup has a crush, to train while he is away. Hiccup returns to the forest and finds the Night Fury still there, unable to fly because Hiccup's bolas tore off half of its tail fin. Hiccup befriends the dragon by offering fish, giving it the name 'Toothless', after its retractable teeth. Feeling guilty for crippling Toothless, Hiccup designs a harness rig and a [[prosthetic]] fin that allow the dragon to fly with Hiccup controlling the prosthetic.\n\nHiccup learns about dragon behavior as he works with Toothless, and is able to nonviolently subdue all the captive dragons during training, earning him the admiration of his peers but causing Astrid to become increasingly suspicious of his behavior. Meanwhile, Stoick's fleet arrives home unsuccessful, though Stoick is cheered by Hiccup's unexpected success in dragon training. Hiccup is judged the winner of his training class, and must kill a dragon for his final exam. He tries to run away with Toothless, only to be followed by Astrid in the forest. Hiccup takes Astrid for a flight to demonstrate that the dragon is friendly. When Astrid reminds Hiccup of the exam, Toothless unexpectedly takes the pair to the dragons' nest, where they discover a gargantuan dragon named the Red Death, which eats the smaller dragons unless they constantly bring it live food; the two realize that the dragons have been attacking Berk under duress. Astrid wishes to tell the village about their discovery, but Hiccup advises against it to protect Toothless.\n\nBack at the village the next day, Hiccup faces a captive Monstrous Nightmare dragon in his final exam. Instead of killing it, however, he subdues it in an attempt to prove that dragons are peaceful. When Stoick inadvertently angers the dragon into attacking, Toothless arrives to protect Hiccup, but is captured by the Vikings in the process. Hiccup accidentally reveals to Stoick that Toothless knows the location of the dragons' nest; Stoick disowns his son, and sets off for the nest with Toothless chained to the lead ship as a guide. After the Vikings have left, Hiccup is devastated, but Astrid prompts him to come to the realization that he spared Toothless out of compassion and empathy, not weakness. Hiccup then regains his confidence to go after Toothless and save him along with Astrid and the other teens.\n\nThe Viking attackers locate and break open the dragon's nest, causing most of the dragons to fly out, but also awakening the Red Death, which soon overwhelms the Vikings. Hiccup, Astrid, and their fellow pupils fly in, riding Berk's captive training dragons, providing cover fire, and distracting the Red Death while Hiccup frees Toothless. Hiccup almost drowns while doing so, but Stoick saves them both, reconciling with his son. Toothless and Hiccup destroy the Red Death by puncturing its wing membranes and then tricking the beast into making a plunge from which it cannot pull up after shooting a fireball into its mouth. Hiccup is injured in the fight, losing his lower left leg. Hiccup awakens back on Berk, finding that Gobber has fashioned him a prosthesis, and he is now admired by his village, especially Astrid, who kisses him. Berk begins a new era, with humans and dragons living in harmony.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Jay Baruchel]] as Hiccup Horrendous Haddock III, the awkward son of Stoick the Vast.<ref name=cast>\"Viking-Sized Cast\", ''How to Train Your Dragon'' Blu-ray</ref>\n* [[America Ferrera]] as Astrid Hofferson, Hiccup's fellow student in dragon training and his love interest. \n* [[Gerard Butler]] as Stoick the Vast, the chieftain of Berk and Hiccup's father.<ref name=cast/>\n* [[Craig Ferguson]] as Gobber the Belch, Berk's blacksmith, a close friend of Stoick's and teacher of the tribe's young dragon-training recruits.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.moviesonline.ca/movienews_17051.html |title=Gerard Butler Interview, Movies Online |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090722103059/http://www.moviesonline.ca/movienews_17051.html |archivedate=July 22, 2009 }}</ref><ref name=cast/>\n* [[Christopher Mintz-Plasse]] as Fishlegs Ingerman, an enthusiastic youth knowledgeable in dragon lore which he often relates in [[role-playing game]] style.<ref>{{cite news|title=Nadder, Zippleback and Gronckle Lessons From 'How to Train Your Dragon' |work=Lineboil |date=February 17, 2010 |url=http://lineboil.com/2010/02/nadder-zippleback-and-gronckle-lessons-from-how-to-train-your-dragon |accessdate=February 17, 2010 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100223003151/http://lineboil.com/2010/02/nadder-zippleback-and-gronckle-lessons-from-how-to-train-your-dragon/ |archivedate=February 23, 2010}}</ref><ref name=cast/>\n* [[Jonah Hill]] as Snotlout Jorgenson, one of Hiccup's dragon-training classmates.

The original plot was described as, \"heavily loyal to the book\", but was regarded as being too \"sweet\" and \"whimsical\" as well as geared towards a too-young demographic, according to Baruchel.<ref name=\"devusatoday\">[https://www.usatoday.com/life/movies/news/2009-11-04-how-to-tame-a-dragon_N.htm First look: DreamWorks' 3-D 'How to Train Your Dragon'].

In the film, Toothless is a Night Fury, the rarest of all dragons, far faster, aerodynamic and more powerful than the other species, and is large enough to serve as a flying mount for both Hiccup and Astrid. The filmmakers hired cinematographer [[Roger Deakins]] (known for frequently collaborating with [[the Coen brothers]]) as a visual consultant to help them with lighting and overall look of the film and to \"add a live-action feel\".<ref name=\"devusatoday\"/> Extensive research was done to depict both flight, as the directors knew they would be the biggest draw of the film's 3D effects, and fire, given animation could break away from the limitations seen in live-action films, where [[propane]] flames are usual due to being easier to extinguish. The dragons' design made sure to create animals that were comical and also innovative compared to other dragon fiction. Toothless in particular tried to combine various dragon traits in a [[black panther]]-inspired design, that also had large ears and eyes to convey emotion better.<ref name=tech>\"The Technical Artistry of 'Dragon'\", ''How to Train Your Dragon'' Blu-ray</ref>\n\nThe directors made sure to cash in the improvisation abilities of the secondary cast\u2014Christopher Mintz-Plasse, Jonah Hill, Kristen Wiig and T.J Miller\u2014by frequently bringing them together in the recording sessions.<ref name=cast/>\n{{clear}}\n\n== Music ==\n{{Main|How to Train Your Dragon: Music from the Motion Picture}}\n[[John Powell (film composer)|John Powell]] returned to DreamWorks Animation to score ''How to Train Your Dragon'', making it his sixth collaboration with the studio, following his previous score for ''[[Kung Fu Panda]]'' (which he scored with [[Hans Zimmer]]). Powell composed an orchestral score, combining bombastic brass with loud percussion and soothing strings, while also using exotic, Scottish and Irish tones with instruments like the [[penny whistle]] and [[bagpipes]]. Additionally, Icelandic singer [[J\u00f3n \u00de\u00f3r Birgisson|J\u00f3nsi]] wrote and performed the song \"Sticks & Stones\" for the film.

The film was directed by [[Chris Sanders]] and [[Dean DeBlois]] from a screenplay by [[William Davies (screenwriter)|Will Davies]], Sanders, and DeBlois, and stars the voices of [[Jay Baruchel]], [[Gerard Butler]], [[Craig Ferguson]], [[America Ferrera]], [[Jonah Hill]], [[Christopher Mintz-Plasse]], [[T.J. Miller]], and [[Kristen Wiig]]. The story takes place in a mythical [[Vikings|Viking]] world where a young Viking teenager named Hiccup aspires to follow his tribe's tradition of becoming a [[dragon]] slayer. After finally capturing his first dragon, and with his chance at last of gaining the tribe's acceptance, he finds that he no longer wants to kill the dragon and instead befriends it.\n\nThe film premiered at the [[Universal Amphitheater|Gibson Amphitheater]] on March 21, 2010,<ref name=\"HTTYDPremiere\" /> and was released in the United States five days later on March 26. The film was a critical and commercial success, earning praise from film critics and audiences and earning nearly $500 million worldwide. It was nominated for the [[Academy Award for Best Animated Feature]] and [[Academy Award for Best Original Score|Best Original Score]] at the [[83rd Academy Awards]], but lost to ''[[Toy Story 3]]'' and ''[[The Social Network]]'', respectively. ''How to Train Your Dragon'' also won ten [[Annie Awards]], including [[Annie Award for Best Animated Feature|Best Animated Feature]].\n\nTwo sequels, ''[[How to Train Your Dragon 2]]'' and ''[[How to Train Your Dragon: The Hidden World]]'', were released on June 13, 2014, and February 22, 2019, respectively. Much like their predecessor, both sequels were widely praised and became box office successes. The film's success has also inspired other merchandise, including a [[How to Train Your Dragon (video game)|video game]] and a [[DreamWorks Dragons|television series]].\n\n== Plot ==\nThe [[Vikings|Viking]] village of Berk, located on a remote island, is attacked frequently by dragons, which take livestock and damage property. Hiccup, the awkward fifteen-year-old son of the village chieftain, Stoick the Vast, is deemed too scrawny and weak to fight the dragons, so he instead creates mechanical devices under his apprenticeship with Gobber, the village blacksmith, though Hiccup's inventions often backfire. During one attack, Hiccup uses a [[bolas]] launcher to shoot down a Night Fury, a dangerous and rare dragon of which little is known, but no one believes him, so he searches for the fallen dragon on his own. He finds the dragon in the forest, tangled in his net, but cannot bring himself to kill it, and instead sets it free.\n\nStoick assembles a fleet to find the dragons' nest, and enters Hiccup in a dragon-fighting class taught by Gobber with the other teenagers, Fishlegs, Snotlout, Ruffnut, Tuffnut, and Astrid, a tough Viking girl on whom Hiccup has a crush, to train while he is away. Hiccup returns to the forest and finds the Night Fury still there, unable to fly because Hiccup's bolas tore off half of its tail fin. Hiccup befriends the dragon by offering fish, giving it the name 'Toothless', after its retractable teeth. Feeling guilty for crippling Toothless, Hiccup designs a harness rig and a [[prosthetic]] fin that allow the dragon to fly with Hiccup controlling the prosthetic.\n\nHiccup learns about dragon behavior as he works with Toothless, and is able to nonviolently subdue all the captive dragons during training, earning him the admiration of his peers but causing Astrid to become increasingly suspicious of his behavior. Meanwhile, Stoick's fleet arrives home unsuccessful, though Stoick is cheered by Hiccup's unexpected success in dragon training. Hiccup is judged the winner of his training class, and must kill a dragon for his final exam. He tries to run away with Toothless, only to be followed by Astrid in the forest. Hiccup takes Astrid for a flight to demonstrate that the dragon is friendly. When Astrid reminds Hiccup of the exam, Toothless unexpectedly takes the pair to the dragons' nest, where they discover a gargantuan dragon named the Red Death, which eats the smaller dragons unless they constantly bring it live food; the two realize that the dragons have been attacking Berk under duress. Astrid wishes to tell the village about their discovery, but Hiccup advises against it to protect Toothless.\n\nBack at the village the next day, Hiccup faces a captive Monstrous Nightmare dragon in his final exam. Instead of killing it, however, he subdues it in an attempt to prove that dragons are peaceful. When Stoick inadvertently angers the dragon into attacking, Toothless arrives to protect Hiccup, but is captured by the Vikings in the process. Hiccup accidentally reveals to Stoick that Toothless knows the location of the dragons' nest; Stoick disowns his son, and sets off for the nest with Toothless chained to the lead ship as a guide. After the Vikings have left, Hiccup is devastated, but Astrid prompts him to come to the realization that he spared Toothless out of compassion and empathy, not weakness. Hiccup then regains his confidence to go after Toothless and save him along with Astrid and the other teens.\n\nThe Viking attackers locate and break open the dragon's nest, causing most of the dragons to fly out, but also awakening the Red Death, which soon overwhelms the Vikings. Hiccup, Astrid, and their fellow pupils fly in, riding Berk's captive training dragons, providing cover fire, and distracting the Red Death while Hiccup frees Toothless. Hiccup almost drowns while doing so, but Stoick saves them both, reconciling with his son. Toothless and Hiccup destroy the Red Death by puncturing its wing membranes and then tricking the beast into making a plunge from which it cannot pull up after shooting a fireball into its mouth. Hiccup is injured in the fight, losing his lower left leg. Hiccup awakens back on Berk, finding that Gobber has fashioned him a prosthesis, and he is now admired by his village, especially Astrid, who kisses him. Berk begins a new era, with humans and dragons living in harmony.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Jay Baruchel]] as Hiccup Horrendous Haddock III, the awkward son of Stoick the Vast.<ref name=cast>\"Viking-Sized Cast\", ''How to Train Your Dragon'' Blu-ray</ref>\n* [[America Ferrera]] as Astrid Hofferson, Hiccup's fellow student in dragon training and his love interest. \n* [[Gerard Butler]] as Stoick the Vast, the chieftain of Berk and Hiccup's father.<ref name=cast/>\n* [[Craig Ferguson]] as Gobber the Belch, Berk's blacksmith, a close friend of Stoick's and teacher of the tribe's young dragon-training recruits.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.moviesonline.ca/movienews_17051.html |title=Gerard Butler Interview, Movies Online |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090722103059/http://www.moviesonline.ca/movienews_17051.html |archivedate=July 22, 2009 }}</ref><ref name=cast/>\n* [[Christopher Mintz-Plasse]] as Fishlegs Ingerman, an enthusiastic youth knowledgeable in dragon lore which he often relates in [[role-playing game]] style.<ref>{{cite news|title=Nadder, Zippleback and Gronckle Lessons From 'How to Train Your Dragon' |work=Lineboil |date=February 17, 2010 |url=http://lineboil.com/2010/02/nadder-zippleback-and-gronckle-lessons-from-how-to-train-your-dragon |accessdate=February 17, 2010 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100223003151/http://lineboil.com/2010/02/nadder-zippleback-and-gronckle-lessons-from-how-to-train-your-dragon/ |archivedate=February 23, 2010}}</ref><ref name=cast/>\n* [[Jonah Hill]] as Snotlout Jorgenson, one of Hiccup's dragon-training classmates.

The filmmakers hired cinematographer [[Roger Deakins]] (known for frequently collaborating with [[the Coen brothers]]) as a visual consultant to help them with lighting and overall look of the film and to \"add a live-action feel\".<ref name=\"devusatoday\"/> Extensive research was done to depict both flight, as the directors knew they would be the biggest draw of the film's 3D effects, and fire, given animation could break away from the limitations seen in live-action films, where [[propane]] flames are usual due to being easier to extinguish.

Additionally, Icelandic singer [[J\u00f3n \u00de\u00f3r Birgisson|J\u00f3nsi]] wrote and performed the song \"Sticks & Stones\" for the film.

The family moved a lot, so Davis was in 26 schools before he was in high school. As a child, schoolyard bullies were an impetus for Davis' to start drawing. He found when he drew that the other kids wanted his art, and the bullies wouldn't beat him up.<ref>https://d23.com/this-day/disney-legend-marc-davis-is-born/</ref>\nDavis studied at the [[Kansas City Art Institute]], the [[California School of Fine Arts]] in San Francisco, and the [[Otis Art Institute]] in Los Angeles.

{"title_page": "Simon Estes", "text_new": "[[File:Simon Estes by Gage Skidmore.jpg|right|thumb|Estes performing in August 2019.]]\n'''Simon Estes''' (born March 2, 1938) is an [[opera]]tic [[bass-baritone]] of [[African-American]] descent who had a major international opera career  beginning in the 1960s. He has sung at most of the world's major opera houses as well as in front of presidents, popes and internationally renowned figures and celebrities including [[Bill Clinton]], [[Richard Nixon]], [[Boris Yeltsin]], [[Yasser Arafat]], [[Nelson Mandela]] and [[Desmond Tutu]]. Notably, he was part of the first generation of black opera singers to achieve widespread success and is viewed as part of a group of performers who were instrumental in helping to break down the barriers of racial prejudice in the opera world.\n\n==Early life and education==\nEstes was born in [[Centerville, Iowa]], the son of Ruth Jeter Estes and Simon Estes. His father was a coal-miner and his grandfather was a former slave who had been sold at auction for $500. Named for his father, Estes was called 'Billy' within his family circle to avoid confusion when addressing the two. One of five children, Estes has three sisters and a younger brother. His family was heavily involved in their local [[Second Baptist Church (Centerville, Iowa)|Baptist church]], and his earliest musical experiences were had there.<ref name=Naumann>{{cite web|author=Molly Myers Naumann|url=http://focus.nps.gov/pdfhost/docs/nrhp/text/99001223.PDF|title=Second Baptist Church|publisher=[[National Park Service]]|accessdate=2016-02-29}}</ref> He remained active with church musical activities and participated in school music programs throughout his youth.\n\nIn 1957 Estes entered the [[University of Iowa]], originally with the intent of studying pre-med. He changed his major to psychology and then religion before finally deciding to switch to vocal music through the influence of faculty member Charles Kellis. At the time Estes had been singing in the university's \"Old Gold Singers\" (he was notably the group's first black singer) and his voice had grabbed Kellis's interest. Kellis became Estes's first voice teacher and it was he who introduced Estes to opera. After finishing his undergraduate studies, Estes pursued further education at the [[Juilliard School]] in 1964, a pursuit which was made possible through funds raised in Iowa.\n\n==Career==\nLike many African-American artists of his day, Estes decided to go to Europe where racial prejudice was not as much of a barrier as it was in the United States. In 1965 he made his professional opera debut as Ramfis in [[Giuseppe Verdi]]'s ''[[Aida]]'' at the [[Deutsche Oper Berlin]] to a warm reception. The following year he scored a major success when he won a bronze medal at Moscow's Tchaikovsky Competition. The competition win led to an invitation from President Lyndon Johnson to perform at the White House in 1966 and several offers for engagements at major opera houses in Europe soon followed.\n\nEstes kept a very busy schedule performing in European opera houses during the late 1960s and the 1970s. He drew particular acclaim for performing leading roles in operas by [[Richard Wagner]]. He appeared at such houses as [[La Scala]], [[Royal Opera, London|Covent Garden]], the [[Op\u00e9ra National de Paris]], the [[Liceu]], the [[Hamburg State Opera]], the [[Bavarian State Opera]], the [[Vienna State Opera]] and the [[Zurich Opera]] among others. He also sang at several notable music festivals, including the [[Salzburg Festival]] and on Continental tours by the [[Glyndebourne Festival]]. In 1978 he notably became the first black male, [[African-American]] or otherwise, to sing a leading role at the prestigious [[Bayreuth Festspielhaus|Bayreuth Festival]] when he sang the title role in Wagner's ''[[Der fliegende Holl\u00e4nder|The Flying Dutchman]]''. The performance was a personal triumph for him and he went on to sing at Bayreuth for the next six consecutive years. He returned to Bayreuth again in 1985 to sing the Dutchman again; a performance that was captured on video and is still considered one of the best recordings of that role.\n\nWhile Estes's career was thriving in the best European houses, he continued to be spurned by many of the major American houses during the 1970s. His debut with the [[Lyric Opera of Chicago]] in 1971 was in the minor role of the Ghost of Nino in ''[[Semiramide]]'', and his successive roles at that house were not any bigger. The [[Metropolitan Opera]] did not even attempt to engage him in the 1960s; in 1976 he sang a single tour performance of Bellini's ''[[Norma (opera)|Norma]]'' with the Met at Wolf Trap. More favorable to him was the [[San Francisco Opera]] (SFO) with whom he sang several good roles in 1967, including the 4 villains in ''[[The Tales of Hoffman]]'' and Carter Jones in the United States premiere of [[Gunther Schuller]]'s ''[[The Visitation (opera)|The Visitation]]''. He returned to the SFO several times during his career, singing Ramfis in [[Giuseppe Verdi]]'s ''[[Aida]]'' (1972), Don Pedro in ''[[L'Africaine]]'' (1972), Raimondo in ''[[Lucia di Lammermoor]]'' (1972), The Flying Dutchman (1979), Marke in Wagner's ''[[Tristan und Isolde]]'' (1980), Amonasro in ''Aida'' (1981), and Escamillo in [[Georges Bizet]]'s ''[[Carmen]]'' (1981).\n\nIn 1981 Estes was finally offered a contract to sing at the home theatre of the [[Metropolitan Opera]] in New York City. He accepted, but at the time was cautioned by [[Leontyne Price]], the first African-American to become a leading [[prima donna]] at the Met, about the difficult road ahead. Price, who suffered actual threats to her life when she first opened at the Met, explained, \"Simon, it's going to be even more difficult for you. Because you are a black male, the discrimination will be greater. You have a beautiful voice; you are musical, intelligent, independent and handsome. With all of these ingredients, you are a threat. It will be more difficult for you than it was for me.\" However, the Met audience and critics responded favourably to Simon's house debut on January 4, 1982 as Hermann in Wagner's ''[[Tannh\u00e4user (opera)|Tannh\u00e4user]]'' with [[Richard Cassilly]] in the title role and [[Leonie Rysanek]] as Elisabeth.\n\nEstes went on to sing in the next six consecutive seasons at the Met, portraying such roles as Amfortas in Wagner's ''[[Parsifal]]'' and Orest in [[Richard Strauss]]'s ''[[Elektra (opera)|Elektra]]''. In 1985, he sang Porgy in the Met's first production of [[George Gershwin|Gershwin]]'s ''[[Porgy and Bess]]''. In 1986, he sang Wotan in the inauguration of the legendary Ring production at the Metropolitan Opera directed by [[Otto Schenk]]. He returned to the Met in 1990 to sing Porgy again and for the last time in 1999 to portray Amonasro to [[Sharon Sweet]]'s Aida. Perhaps his greatest Met moment was singing the role of Amonasro to Price's Aida for her farewell opera performance which was telecast live on national television on January 3, 1985.\n\nHe is a National Patron of [[Delta Omicron]], an international professional music fraternity.<ref>[http://delta-omicron.org/national/patrons.html#E Delta Omicron] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160313224501/http://delta-omicron.org/national/patrons.html#E |date=March 13, 2016 }}</ref>\n\n==Humanitarian work==\nMore recently, Estes has turned his attention to the fight against [[HIV]]/[[AIDS]]. At the forefront of Artists for HIV/AIDS prevention and education, Estes leads a collective voice of artists, who through music and arts, seek to break down socio-economic barriers as well as the stigma associated with the disease.\n\nOn July 9, 2010, he performed at the World Cup during the opening \"Tribute to South Africa\" at the FIFA Gala Concert in Johannesburg, South Africa. There he learned about the increasing problem of malaria in South Africa and decided also to get engaged in the fight against this illness.\n\nIn 2013, the Simon Estes Foundation inaugurated a program called \"Iowa Students Care,\" to engage Iowa students in the cause of eliminating malaria in Africa by raising funds to provide treated bed nets for African children.<ref name=\"simonestesfoundation.org\">{{cite web|url=http://www.simonestesfoundation.org/project1.php|title=Simon Estes Foundation: Malaria Project|publisher=|accessdate=12 October 2016}}</ref> Its \"Eliminate Malaria Campaign\" was engaged in partnership with the [[United Nations Foundation]] and its Nothing But Nets Campaign, and was endorsed the governor and lieutenant governor of the state of Iowa.

He has performed in Wartburg's Christmas concert, Christmas With Wartburg, and has been known to go on domestic and international spring tours with Wartburg's concert choir.  He is listed on the artist faculty of Boston University and he is also the F. Wendell Miller Distinguished Artist in Residence at [[Iowa State University]] in [[Ames, Iowa]].<ref name=\"isuestes\">[http://music.iastate.edu/faculty/estes Simon Estes] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120207032539/http://music.iastate.edu/faculty/estes |date=February 7, 2012 }}.

He has sung at most of the world's major opera houses as well as in front of presidents, popes and internationally renowned figures and celebrities including [[Bill Clinton]], [[Richard Nixon]], [[Boris Yeltsin]], [[Yasser Arafat]], [[Nelson Mandela]] and [[Desmond Tutu]]. Notably, he was part of the first generation of black opera singers to achieve widespread success and is viewed as part of a group of performers who were instrumental in helping to break down the barriers of racial prejudice in the opera world.\n\n==Early life and education==\nEstes was born in [[Centerville, Iowa]], the son of Ruth Jeter Estes and Simon Estes. His father was a coal-miner and his grandfather was a former slave who had been sold at auction for $500. Named for his father, Estes was called 'Billy' within his family circle to avoid confusion when addressing the two. One of five children, Estes has three sisters and a younger brother. His family was heavily involved in their local [[Second Baptist Church (Centerville, Iowa)|Baptist church]], and his earliest musical experiences were had there.<ref name=Naumann>{{cite web|author=Molly Myers Naumann|url=http://focus.nps.gov/pdfhost/docs/nrhp/text/99001223.PDF|title=Second Baptist Church|publisher=[[National Park Service]]|accessdate=2016-02-29}}</ref> He remained active with church musical activities and participated in school music programs throughout his youth.\n\nIn 1957 Estes entered the [[University of Iowa]], originally with the intent of studying pre-med. He changed his major to psychology and then religion before finally deciding to switch to vocal music through the influence of faculty member Charles Kellis. At the time Estes had been singing in the university's \"Old Gold Singers\" (he was notably the group's first black singer) and his voice had grabbed Kellis's interest. Kellis became Estes's first voice teacher and it was he who introduced Estes to opera. After finishing his undergraduate studies, Estes pursued further education at the [[Juilliard School]] in 1964, a pursuit which was made possible through funds raised in Iowa.\n\n==Career==\nLike many African-American artists of his day, Estes decided to go to Europe where racial prejudice was not as much of a barrier as it was in the United States. In 1965 he made his professional opera debut as Ramfis in [[Giuseppe Verdi]]'s ''[[Aida]]'' at the [[Deutsche Oper Berlin]] to a warm reception. The following year he scored a major success when he won a bronze medal at Moscow's Tchaikovsky Competition. The competition win led to an invitation from President Lyndon Johnson to perform at the White House in 1966 and several offers for engagements at major opera houses in Europe soon followed.\n\nEstes kept a very busy schedule performing in European opera houses during the late 1960s and the 1970s. He drew particular acclaim for performing leading roles in operas by [[Richard Wagner]]. He appeared at such houses as [[La Scala]], [[Royal Opera, London|Covent Garden]], the [[Op\u00e9ra National de Paris]], the [[Liceu]], the [[Hamburg State Opera]], the [[Bavarian State Opera]], the [[Vienna State Opera]] and the [[Zurich Opera]] among others. He also sang at several notable music festivals, including the [[Salzburg Festival]] and on Continental tours by the [[Glyndebourne Festival]]. In 1978 he notably became the first black male, [[African-American]] or otherwise, to sing a leading role at the prestigious [[Bayreuth Festspielhaus|Bayreuth Festival]] when he sang the title role in Wagner's ''[[Der fliegende Holl\u00e4nder|The Flying Dutchman]]''. The performance was a personal triumph for him and he went on to sing at Bayreuth for the next six consecutive years. He returned to Bayreuth again in 1985 to sing the Dutchman again; a performance that was captured on video and is still considered one of the best recordings of that role.\n\nWhile Estes's career was thriving in the best European houses, he continued to be spurned by many of the major American houses during the 1970s. His debut with the [[Lyric Opera of Chicago]] in 1971 was in the minor role of the Ghost of Nino in ''[[Semiramide]]'', and his successive roles at that house were not any bigger. The [[Metropolitan Opera]] did not even attempt to engage him in the 1960s; in 1976 he sang a single tour performance of Bellini's ''[[Norma (opera)|Norma]]'' with the Met at Wolf Trap. More favorable to him was the [[San Francisco Opera]] (SFO) with whom he sang several good roles in 1967, including the 4 villains in ''[[The Tales of Hoffman]]'' and Carter Jones in the United States premiere of [[Gunther Schuller]]'s ''[[The Visitation (opera)|The Visitation]]''. He returned to the SFO several times during his career, singing Ramfis in [[Giuseppe Verdi]]'s ''[[Aida]]'' (1972), Don Pedro in ''[[L'Africaine]]'' (1972), Raimondo in ''[[Lucia di Lammermoor]]'' (1972), The Flying Dutchman (1979), Marke in Wagner's ''[[Tristan und Isolde]]'' (1980), Amonasro in ''Aida'' (1981), and Escamillo in [[Georges Bizet]]'s ''[[Carmen]]'' (1981).\n\nIn 1981 Estes was finally offered a contract to sing at the home theatre of the [[Metropolitan Opera]] in New York City. He accepted, but at the time was cautioned by [[Leontyne Price]], the first African-American to become a leading [[prima donna]] at the Met, about the difficult road ahead. Price, who suffered actual threats to her life when she first opened at the Met, explained, \"Simon, it's going to be even more difficult for you. Because you are a black male, the discrimination will be greater. You have a beautiful voice; you are musical, intelligent, independent and handsome. With all of these ingredients, you are a threat. It will be more difficult for you than it was for me.\" However, the Met audience and critics responded favourably to Simon's house debut on January 4, 1982 as Hermann in Wagner's ''[[Tannh\u00e4user (opera)|Tannh\u00e4user]]'' with [[Richard Cassilly]] in the title role and [[Leonie Rysanek]] as Elisabeth.\n\nEstes went on to sing in the next six consecutive seasons at the Met, portraying such roles as Amfortas in Wagner's ''[[Parsifal]]'' and Orest in [[Richard Strauss]]'s ''[[Elektra (opera)|Elektra]]''. In 1985, he sang Porgy in the Met's first production of [[George Gershwin|Gershwin]]'s ''[[Porgy and Bess]]''. In 1986, he sang Wotan in the inauguration of the legendary Ring production at the Metropolitan Opera directed by [[Otto Schenk]]. He returned to the Met in 1990 to sing Porgy again and for the last time in 1999 to portray Amonasro to [[Sharon Sweet]]'s Aida. Perhaps his greatest Met moment was singing the role of Amonasro to Price's Aida for her farewell opera performance which was telecast live on national television on January 3, 1985.\n\nHe is a National Patron of [[Delta Omicron]], an international professional music fraternity.<ref>[http://delta-omicron.org/national/patrons.html#E Delta Omicron] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160313224501/http://delta-omicron.org/national/patrons.html#E |date=March 13, 2016 }}</ref>\n\n==Humanitarian work==\nMore recently, Estes has turned his attention to the fight against [[HIV]]/[[AIDS]]. At the forefront of Artists for HIV/AIDS prevention and education, Estes leads a collective voice of artists, who through music and arts, seek to break down socio-economic barriers as well as the stigma associated with the disease.\n\nOn July 9, 2010, he performed at the World Cup during the opening \"Tribute to South Africa\" at the FIFA Gala Concert in Johannesburg, South Africa. There he learned about the increasing problem of malaria in South Africa and decided also to get engaged in the fight against this illness.\n\nIn 2013, the Simon Estes Foundation inaugurated a program called \"Iowa Students Care,\" to engage Iowa students in the cause of eliminating malaria in Africa by raising funds to provide treated bed nets for African children.<ref name=\"simonestesfoundation.org\">{{cite web|url=http://www.simonestesfoundation.org/project1.php|title=Simon Estes Foundation: Malaria Project|publisher=|accessdate=12 October 2016}}</ref> Its \"Eliminate Malaria Campaign\" was engaged in partnership with the [[United Nations Foundation]] and its Nothing But Nets Campaign, and was endorsed the governor and lieutenant governor of the state of Iowa.

It is considered a spiritual successor to Deck13 Interactive's earlier action role-playing game ''[[Lords of the Fallen]]'', with which it shares many gameplay features. Deck13 Interactive described the game as inspired by ''[[Rise of the Robots]]''<ref>{{cite web |last=Warman |first=Dylan |date=13 May 2017 |url=http://onlysp.com/the-surge-launch-trailer-released-ahead-of-schedule/ |title=The Surge Launch Trailer Released Ahead of Schedule |publisher=OnlySP |accessdate=13 May 2017}}</ref> and the ''[[Souls (series)|Souls]]'' series.<ref>{{cite web |last=Kollar |first=Philip |date=13 June 2016 |url=http://www.polygon.com/e3/2016/6/13/11924288/the-surge-e3-2016-trailer-pc-gaming-show-dark-souls-deck13 |title=See Dark Souls reimagined as sci-fi in the latest trailer for The Surge |publisher=[[Polygon (website)|Polygon]] |accessdate=13 June 2016}}</ref>\n\n==Gameplay==\n''The Surge'' is designed in the challenging [[role-playing game]] style of the ''[[Souls (series)|Souls]]'' series of games. The gameplay involves players using an [[exoskeleton]] to battle enemies. The exoskeleton can be customized through the game using \"modular upgrades\", according to the developer. The combat allows players to target different body parts of enemies, as well as utilize finishing moves often ending in dismemberment in [[bullet time]] fashion.\n\n==Plot==\nThe game takes place in a dystopian future where humans have [[Resource depletion|exhausted the world's resources]], leading to strained social service and environmental diseases. According to the developers, the game paints a grim portrait of the future where the evolution of technology in relation to society and the environment has led to a decadent era for humanity. The proliferation of drones and working robots has created mass unemployment, with humans forced to resort to [[Cyborg|augmentations]] and [[Powered exoskeleton|powered rigs]] to keep up with a far more efficient equivalent.\n\nThe player takes control of Warren, a new employee on his first day on the job on board a bullet train towards the headquarters of CREO, one of the largest tech conglomerates now controlling the world, renowned for its revolutionary breakthroughs in a multitude of fields, from common household items to advanced exoskeletons. Its most relevant activity however is \"Project reSOLVE\", ideated by its founder Jonah Guttenberg, which involves a complex chemical formula dispersed via rockets to slowly reseed the Earth's damaged atmosphere, as well as boost the growth of flora worldwide. \n\nAfter choosing a starting robotic rig, Warren (who uses a wheelchair) is prepared for surgical implantation of an advanced CREO exoskeleton, gone horribly wrong when the automated system fails to sedate him, painfully grafting each component until he passes out during neurosurgery. Waking up, Warren finds the facility in ruins, with drones attacking personnel and fellow workers prey to a deranged bloodthirst.

It is considered a spiritual successor to Deck13 Interactive's earlier action role-playing game ''[[Lords of the Fallen]]'', with which it shares many gameplay features. Deck13 Interactive described the game as inspired by ''[[Rise of the Robots]]''<ref>{{cite web |last=Warman |first=Dylan |date=13 May 2017 |url=http://onlysp.com/the-surge-launch-trailer-released-ahead-of-schedule/ |title=The Surge Launch Trailer Released Ahead of Schedule |publisher=OnlySP |accessdate=13 May 2017}}</ref> and the ''[[Souls (series)|Souls]]'' series.<ref>{{cite web |last=Kollar |first=Philip |date=13 June 2016 |url=http://www.polygon.com/e3/2016/6/13/11924288/the-surge-e3-2016-trailer-pc-gaming-show-dark-souls-deck13 |title=See Dark Souls reimagined as sci-fi in the latest trailer for The Surge |publisher=[[Polygon (website)|Polygon]] |accessdate=13 June 2016}}</ref>\n\n==Gameplay==\n''The Surge'' is designed in the challenging [[role-playing game]] style of the ''[[Souls (series)|Souls]]'' series of games. The gameplay involves players using an [[exoskeleton]] to battle enemies. The exoskeleton can be customized through the game using \"modular upgrades\", according to the developer. The combat allows players to target different body parts of enemies, as well as utilize finishing moves often ending in dismemberment in [[bullet time]] fashion.\n\n==Plot==\nThe game takes place in a dystopian future where humans have [[Resource depletion|exhausted the world's resources]], leading to strained social service and environmental diseases. According to the developers, the game paints a grim portrait of the future where the evolution of technology in relation to society and the environment has led to a decadent era for humanity. The proliferation of drones and working robots has created mass unemployment, with humans forced to resort to [[Cyborg|augmentations]] and [[Powered exoskeleton|powered rigs]] to keep up with a far more efficient equivalent.\n\nThe player takes control of Warren, a new employee on his first day on the job on board a bullet train towards the headquarters of CREO, one of the largest tech conglomerates now controlling the world, renowned for its revolutionary breakthroughs in a multitude of fields, from common household items to advanced exoskeletons. Its most relevant activity however is \"Project reSOLVE\", ideated by its founder Jonah Guttenberg, which involves a complex chemical formula dispersed via rockets to slowly reseed the Earth's damaged atmosphere, as well as boost the growth of flora worldwide. \n\nAfter choosing a starting robotic rig, Warren (who uses a wheelchair) is prepared for surgical implantation of an advanced CREO exoskeleton, gone horribly wrong when the automated system fails to sedate him, painfully grafting each component until he passes out during neurosurgery. Waking up, Warren finds the facility in ruins, with drones attacking personnel and fellow workers prey to a deranged bloodthirst. Guided by an executive known only as \"Sally\", Warren is forced to traverse the entire complex, up to the Executive Forum, in order to find out what exactly happened.\n\nAs the player gathers audiologs, meets different NPCs and explores the decadent structures, it becomes evident that Project reSOLVE is indeed working, but at a pace far too slowly to ensure mankind's survival, along with unspecified long-term toxicity. Under pressure, the CREO board of directors chose to fast-track \"Project UTOPIA\", which involved large-scale usage of [[Molecular machine|nanites]] to achieve the intended result much faster, but at the expense of killing off 95% of the human race after its initial deployment. Battling his way into the Executive Forum and disabling its firewall, Warren is exposed to the truth about the plot and CREO: as the board of directors debated whether to launch or not UTOPIA's rockets, its nanites became self-aware and, in an attempt at self-preservation, created a system-wide crash (the eponymous surge) that corrupted every human and machine connected to CREO's network. The devastation destroyed CREO's governing AIs (\"Guttenberg\" and \"Sally\" being two of them) and killed off its executives. As the last one dies, UTOPIA's launch is authorized by the automated system. \n\nWarren subsequently advances through UTOPIA's launch platform in order to stop the rocket, until he is confronted by an amalgam of the nanites' consciousnesses, the \"Rogue Process\".
