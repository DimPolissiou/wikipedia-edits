The name refers to its executable filename.  It is also commonly referred to as '''cmd''' or the '''Command Prompt''', referring to the default window title on Windows.  The implementations differ on the various systems but the behavior and basic set of commands is generally consistent.  {{mono|cmd.exe}} is the counterpart of {{mono|[[COMMAND.COM]]}} in [[DOS]] and [[Windows 9x]] systems, and analogous to the [[Unix shell]]s used on [[Unix-like]] systems. The initial version of {{mono|cmd.exe}} for [[Windows NT]] was developed by Therese Stowell.<ref name=\"Zachary_1994\"/>\n[[Windows CE 2.11]] was the first embedded Windows release to support a console and a Windows CE version of {{mono|cmd.exe}}.<ref>{{Cite book|author=Douglas McConnaughey Boling|year=2001|title=Programming Microsoft Windows CE|edition=2nd|publisher=[[Microsoft Press]]|isbn=978-0735614437}}</ref>\nOn [[Windows CE .NET 4.2]],<ref>[https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/previous-versions/windows/embedded/ms879823(v%3dmsdn.10) Command Processor Shell (Windows CE .NET 4.2) | Microsoft Docs]</ref> [[Windows CE 5.0]]<ref>[https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/previous-versions/windows/embedded/aa453925%28v%3dmsdn.10%29 Command Processor Shell (Windows CE 5.0) | Microsoft Docs]</ref> and [[Windows Embedded CE 6.0]]<ref>[https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/previous-versions/windows/embedded/ee499728%28v%3dwinembedded.60%29 Command Processor Shell (Windows Embedded CE 6.0) | Microsoft Docs]</ref> it is also referred to as '''Command Processor Shell'''.\nThe ReactOS implementation of {{mono|cmd.exe}} is derived from FreeCOM, the [[FreeDOS]] command line interpreter.<ref name=\"ReactOS\" />\n\n==Operation==\n{{mono|cmd.exe}} interacts with the user through a [[command-line interface]]. On Windows, this interface is implemented through the [[Win32 console]]. {{mono|cmd.exe}} may take advantage of features available to native programs of its own platform. For example, on OS/2 and Windows, it can use real [[Pipeline (Unix)|pipes]] in command pipelines, allowing both sides of the pipeline to run concurrently. As a result, it is possible to redirect the [[standard error stream]]. ({{mono|COMMAND.COM}} uses temporary files, and runs the two sides serially, one after the other.)\n\nMultiple commands can be processed in a single command line using the command separator {{mono|&&}}.<ref name=\"docs.microsoft.com\">[https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-server/administration/windows-commands/cmd cmd | Microsoft Docs]</ref>\nFor example:\n<source lang=\"dos\">\nC:\\>CommandA && CommandB && CommandC\n</source>\n\nOn [[Windows XP]] or later, the maximum length of the string that can be used at the command prompt is 8191 characters. On earlier versions, such as [[Windows 2000]] or [[Windows NT 4.0]], the maximum length of the string is 2047 characters. This limit includes the command line, individual [[environment variable]]s that are inherited by other [[process (computing)|processes]], and all environment variable expansions.<ref>[https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/830473/command-prompt-cmd-exe-command-line-string-limitation Command prompt (Cmd. exe) command-line string limitation]</ref>\n\nQuotation marks are required for the following [[special character]]s:<ref name=\"docs.microsoft.com\" />\n & < > [ ] { } ^ = ; !

end}}\n\n==Comparison with COMMAND.COM==\nOn Windows, {{mono|cmd.exe}} is mostly compatible with {{mono|COMMAND.COM}} but provides the following extensions over it:\n\n* More detailed error messages than the blanket \"[[Bad command or file name]]\" (in the case of malformed commands) of {{mono|COMMAND.COM}}. In OS/2, errors are reported in the chosen language of the system, their text being taken from the system message files. The {{mono|[[help (command)|HELP]]}} command can then be issued with the error message number to obtain further information.\n* Supports using of arrow keys to scroll through command history. (Under DOS this function was only available under [[DR DOS]] (through [[HISTORY (CONFIG.SYS directive)|HISTORY]]) and later via a external component called {{mono|[[DOSKEY]]}}.)\n* Adds [[command-line completion]] for file and folder paths.\n* Treats the [[caret]] character ({{mono|^}}) as the [[escape character]]; the character following it is to be taken literally. There are special characters in {{mono|cmd.exe}} and {{mono|COMMAND.COM}} (e.g. \"{{mono|<}}\", \"{{mono|>}}\" and \"|\") that are meant to alter the behavior of the command line processor. The caret character forces the command line processor to interpret them literally.\n* Supports delayed variable expansion with [[SETLOCAL EnableDelayedExpansion]], allowing values of variables to be calculated at runtime instead of during parsing of script before execution (Windows 2000 and later), fixing DOS idioms that made using [[control structures]] hard and complex.<ref name=\"Delay\"/> The extensions can be disabled, providing a stricter compatibility mode.\n\nInternal commands have also been improved:\n\n* The {{mono|[[DELTREE]]}} command was merged into the {{mono|[[RMDIR|RD]]}} command, as part of its {{mono|/S}} [[Switch (command line)|switch]].\n* {{mono|SetLocal}} and {{mono|EndLocal}} commands limit the scope of changes to the environment. Changes made to the command line environment after {{mono|SetLocal}} commands are local to the [[batch file]]. {{mono|EndLocal}} command restores the previous settings.<ref name=\"SetLocal\"/>\n* The {{mono|Call}} command allows subroutines within batch file. The {{mono|Call}} command in {{mono|COMMAND.COM}} only supports calling external batch files.\n* File name parser extensions to the {{mono|Set}} command are comparable with [[C shell]].{{Elucidate|reason=|date=October 2015}}\n* The {{mono|Set}} command can perform [[Expression Evaluation|expression evaluation]].\n* An expansion of the {{mono|[[For loop|For]]}} command supports parsing files and arbitrary sets in addition to file names.\n* The new {{mono|[[PUSHD|PushD]]}} and {{mono|[[POPD|PopD]]}} commands provide access past navigated paths similar to \"forward\" and \"back\" buttons in a web browser or [[File Explorer]].\n* The conditional {{mono|IF}} command can perform [[Case sensitivity|case-insensitive]] comparisons and numeric equality and inequality comparisons in addition to case-sensitive string comparisons.

The name refers to its executable filename.  It is also commonly referred to as '''cmd''' or the '''Command Prompt''', referring to the default window title on Windows.  The implementations differ on the various systems but the behavior and basic set of commands is generally consistent.  {{mono|cmd.exe}} is the counterpart of {{mono|[[COMMAND.COM]]}} in [[DOS]] and [[Windows 9x]] systems, and analogous to the [[Unix shell]]s used on [[Unix-like]] systems. The initial version of {{mono|cmd.exe}} for [[Windows NT]] was developed by Therese Stowell.<ref name=\"Zachary_1994\"/>\n[[Windows CE 2.11]] was the first embedded Windows release to support a console and a Windows CE version of {{mono|cmd.exe}}.<ref>{{Cite book|author=Douglas McConnaughey Boling|year=2001|title=Programming Microsoft Windows CE|edition=2nd|publisher=[[Microsoft Press]]|isbn=978-0735614437}}</ref>\nOn [[Windows CE .NET 4.2]],<ref>[https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/previous-versions/windows/embedded/ms879823(v%3dmsdn.10) Command Processor Shell (Windows CE .NET 4.2) | Microsoft Docs]</ref> [[Windows CE 5.0]]<ref>[https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/previous-versions/windows/embedded/aa453925%28v%3dmsdn.10%29 Command Processor Shell (Windows CE 5.0) | Microsoft Docs]</ref> and [[Windows Embedded CE 6.0]]<ref>[https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/previous-versions/windows/embedded/ee499728%28v%3dwinembedded.60%29 Command Processor Shell (Windows Embedded CE 6.0) | Microsoft Docs]</ref> it is also referred to as '''Command Processor Shell'''.\nThe ReactOS implementation of {{mono|cmd.exe}} is derived from FreeCOM, the [[FreeDOS]] command line interpreter.<ref name=\"ReactOS\" />\n\n==Operation==\n{{mono|cmd.exe}} interacts with the user through a [[command-line interface]]. On Windows, this interface is implemented through the [[Win32 console]]. {{mono|cmd.exe}} may take advantage of features available to native programs of its own platform. For example, on OS/2 and Windows, it can use real [[Pipeline (Unix)|pipes]] in command pipelines, allowing both sides of the pipeline to run concurrently. As a result, it is possible to redirect the [[standard error stream]]. ({{mono|COMMAND.COM}} uses temporary files, and runs the two sides serially, one after the other.)\n\nMultiple commands can be processed in a single command line using the command separator {{mono|&&}}.<ref name=\"docs.microsoft.com\">[https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-server/administration/windows-commands/cmd cmd | Microsoft Docs]</ref>\nFor example:\n<source lang=\"dos\">\nC:\\>CommandA && CommandB && CommandC\n</source>\n\nOn [[Windows XP]] or later, the maximum length of the string that can be used at the command prompt is 8191 characters. On earlier versions, such as [[Windows 2000]] or [[Windows NT 4.0]], the maximum length of the string is 2047 characters. This limit includes the command line, individual [[environment variable]]s that are inherited by other [[process (computing)|processes]], and all environment variable expansions.<ref>[https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/830473/command-prompt-cmd-exe-command-line-string-limitation Command prompt (Cmd. exe) command-line string limitation]</ref>\n\nQuotation marks are required for the following [[special character]]s:<ref name=\"docs.microsoft.com\" />\n & < > [ ] { } ^ = ; !

end}}\n\n==Comparison with COMMAND.COM==\nOn Windows, {{mono|cmd.exe}} is mostly compatible with {{mono|COMMAND.COM}} but provides the following extensions over it:\n\n* More detailed error messages than the blanket \"[[Bad command or file name]]\" (in the case of malformed commands) of {{mono|COMMAND.COM}}. In OS/2, errors are reported in the chosen language of the system, their text being taken from the system message files. The {{mono|[[help (command)|HELP]]}} command can then be issued with the error message number to obtain further information.\n* Supports using of arrow keys to scroll through command history. (Under DOS this function was only available under [[DR DOS]] (through [[HISTORY (CONFIG.SYS directive)|HISTORY]]) and later via a external component called {{mono|[[DOSKEY]]}}.)\n* Adds [[command-line completion]] for file and folder paths.\n* Treats the [[caret]] character ({{mono|^}}) as the [[escape character]]; the character following it is to be taken literally. There are special characters in {{mono|cmd.exe}} and {{mono|COMMAND.COM}} (e.g. \"{{mono|<}}\", \"{{mono|>}}\" and \"|\") that are meant to alter the behavior of the command line processor. The caret character forces the command line processor to interpret them literally.\n* Supports delayed variable expansion with [[SETLOCAL EnableDelayedExpansion]], allowing values of variables to be calculated at runtime instead of during parsing of script before execution (Windows 2000 and later), fixing DOS idioms that made using [[control structures]] hard and complex.<ref name=\"Delay\"/> The extensions can be disabled, providing a stricter compatibility mode.\n\nInternal commands have also been improved:\n\n* The {{mono|[[DELTREE]]}} command was merged into the {{mono|[[RMDIR|RD]]}} command, as part of its {{mono|/S}} [[Switch (command line)|switch]].\n* {{mono|SetLocal}} and {{mono|EndLocal}} commands limit the scope of changes to the environment. Changes made to the command line environment after {{mono|SetLocal}} commands are local to the [[batch file]]. {{mono|EndLocal}} command restores the previous settings.<ref name=\"SetLocal\"/>\n* The {{mono|Call}} command allows subroutines within batch file. The {{mono|Call}} command in {{mono|COMMAND.COM}} only supports calling external batch files.\n* File name parser extensions to the {{mono|Set}} command are comparable with [[C shell]].{{Elucidate|reason=|date=October 2015}}\n* The {{mono|Set}} command can perform [[Expression Evaluation|expression evaluation]].\n* An expansion of the {{mono|[[For loop|For]]}} command supports parsing files and arbitrary sets in addition to file names.\n* The new {{mono|[[PUSHD|PushD]]}} and {{mono|[[POPD|PopD]]}} commands provide access past navigated paths similar to \"forward\" and \"back\" buttons in a web browser or [[File Explorer]].\n* The conditional {{mono|IF}} command can perform [[Case sensitivity|case-insensitive]] comparisons and numeric equality and inequality comparisons in addition to case-sensitive string comparisons. (This was available in DR-DOS, but not in [[PC&nbsp;DOS]] or [[MS-DOS]].)\n\n==See also==\n* [[Comparison of command shells]]\n* [[List of DOS commands]]\n* [[Windows Terminal]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|refs=\n<ref name=\"Zachary_1994\">{{Cite book |title=Showstopper!

Accessed March 8, 2020.</ref> The township got its name from New Brunswick, which in turn was named after the city of [[Braunschweig]] (called ''Brunswick'' in the [[Low German]] language), in state of [[Lower Saxony]], in [[Germany]]. Braunschweig was an influential and powerful city in the [[Hanseatic League]], later in the [[Holy Roman Empire]], and was an administrative seat for the Duchy (and later Principality) of Hanover. Shortly after the first settlement of New Brunswick in colonial New Jersey, George, Duke of Brunswick-L\u00fcneburg, and Elector of Hanover, of the [[House of Hanover]] (also known as the ''House of Brunswick''), became [[George I of Great Britain|King George I of Great Britain]] (1660\u20131727). Alternatively, the city derived its name from King [[George II of Great Britain]], the [[Duchy of Brunswick-L\u00fcneburg|Duke of Brunswick-L\u00fcneburg]].<ref>Hutchinson, Viola L.

In 1885, it redefined and enlarged the boundaries of Cranbury, and [[Plainsboro Township, New Jersey|Plainsboro Township]] was formed in 1919. The present boundaries of South Brunswick date back to this last change.<ref name=Story/>\n\nDuring the 20th century, South Brunswick saw extensive transformation with the impact of changes in transportation technology. The [[New Brunswick and Trenton Fast Line]] began operation in 1900, a trolley line running parallel to the Old Straight Turnpike of 1804 ([[U.S. Route 1 in New Jersey|Route 1]]), intersecting George's Road just north of the Five Corners intersection in Dayton. This trolley provided daily passenger and freight service, stopping at a local crossroads. The [[New Jersey Turnpike]] opened in 1951, again roughly parallel to Route 1, on the eastern edge of the Township. One effect of the Turnpike opening up Interchange 8A (just outside the township) was the transformation of the agricultural area on the southeast corner of South Brunswick to that of a burgeoning industrial development. Significant portions of land between Route 130 and the [[New Jersey Turnpike|turnpike]] consist largely of warehouses.<ref>Cifelli, Melissa.

Braunschweig was an influential and powerful city in the [[Hanseatic League]], later in the [[Holy Roman Empire]], and was an administrative seat for the Duchy (and later Principality) of Hanover. Shortly after the first settlement of New Brunswick in colonial New Jersey, George, Duke of Brunswick-L\u00fcneburg, and Elector of Hanover, of the [[House of Hanover]] (also known as the ''House of Brunswick''), became [[George I of Great Britain|King George I of Great Britain]] (1660\u20131727).

In 1885, it redefined and enlarged the boundaries of Cranbury, and [[Plainsboro Township, New Jersey|Plainsboro Township]] was formed in 1919. The present boundaries of South Brunswick date back to this last change.<ref name=Story/>\n\nDuring the 20th century, South Brunswick saw extensive transformation with the impact of changes in transportation technology. The [[New Brunswick and Trenton Fast Line]] began operation in 1900, a trolley line running parallel to the Old Straight Turnpike of 1804 ([[U.S. Route 1 in New Jersey|Route 1]]), intersecting George's Road just north of the Five Corners intersection in Dayton. This trolley provided daily passenger and freight service, stopping at a local crossroads. The [[New Jersey Turnpike]] opened in 1951, again roughly parallel to Route 1, on the eastern edge of the Township. One effect of the Turnpike opening up Interchange 8A (just outside the township) was the transformation of the agricultural area on the southeast corner of South Brunswick to that of a burgeoning industrial development. Significant portions of land between Route 130 and the [[New Jersey Turnpike|turnpike]] consist largely of warehouses.<ref>Cifelli, Melissa.

According to the religion, Jesus is this messiah,<ref name=\"Sontag102\"/> but his premature execution (before he could start a family) meant that his messianic role as the head of a sinless new humanity was passed on to Moon.\n\nIn 1980 Unification theologian [[Young Oon Kim]] wrote:\n{{quote|Unification theology teaches that Jesus came to establish the kingdom of heaven on earth. As St. Paul wrote, Jesus was to be the new Adam restoring the lost garden of Eden. For this purpose he chose twelve apostles, symbolizing the original twelve tribes of Israel, and sent out seventy disciples, symbolizing all the nations of the world. Like John the Baptist, Jesus proclaimed that the long-awaited kingdom of heaven was at hand (Matt. 4:17).  Jesus was appointed God's earthly representative in order to subjugate Satan, cleanse men of original sin and free them from the power of evil. Christ's mission involved liberation from sin and raising mankind to the perfection stage. His purpose was to bring about the kingdom of heaven in our world with the help of men filled with divine truth and love. Jesus' goal was to restore the garden of Eden, a place of joy and beauty in which true families of perfected parents would dwell with God in a full relationship of reciprocal love.<ref>Kim, Young Oon, 1980, [http://www.religious.org/ucbooks/UTheol/toc.htm Unification Theology], Barrytown, NY: [[Unification Theological Seminary]], Library of Congress Cataloging number 80-52872</ref>}}\n\nThe Unification movement view of Jesus has been criticized by mainstream Christian authors and theologians. In their influential book ''[[The Kingdom of the Cults]]'' (first published in 1965), Walter Ralston Martin and Ravi K. Zacharias disagreed with the ''Divine Principle'' on the issues of the [[divinity of Christ]], the [[virgin birth of Jesus]], the Unification Church's belief that Jesus should have married and a literal [[resurrection of Jesus]] as well as a literal [[Second Coming]].  They add: \"Moon makes all men equal in 'divinity' to Jesus, thereby striking a blow at the uniqueness of Christ.\"<ref>Walter Ralston Martin, Ravi K. Zacharias, ''The Kingdom of the Cults'', Bethany House, 2003, {{ISBN|0764228218}}  pages 368-370</ref>\n\nThe ''Divine Principle'' responds to this criticism  by saying:\n{{quote|There is no greater value than that of a person who has realized the ideal of creation. This is the value of Jesus, who surely attained the highest imaginable value. The conventional Christian belief in Jesus' divinity is well founded because, as a perfect human being, Jesus is totally one with God. To assert that Jesus is none other than a man who has completed the purpose of creation does not degrade the value of Jesus in the least.<ref>[http://www.unification.net/dp96/dp96-1-7.html#Chap7 Divine Principle], Chapter 7, Section 2.2</ref>}}\n\nUnificationist theologian [[Young Oon Kim]] wrote, and some members of the Unification movement believe, that [[Zechariah (priest)|Zechariah]] was the father of Jesus, based on the work of English [[Christian theology|Christian theologian]] in the [[Liberal Christianity|liberal Protestant]] tradition, [[Leslie Weatherhead]].<ref name = \"USArmy\">{{cite book|author=United States Department of the Army|authorlink=United States Department of the Army|title=Religious Requirements and Practices: A Handbook for Chaplains|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=6gDQfnMUI6gC|date=October 2001|publisher=The Minerva Group, Inc.|isbn=978-0-89875-607-4|pages=1\u201342}}</ref><ref name=\"Sontag102\"/><ref>{{cite book|author= Weatherhead, L.D.|title=The Christian Agnostic|pages=59\u201363|publisher=Hodder and Stoughton|location=England|year=1965|url=http://DLMcN.com/weatherhead.html}}</ref><ref>''Another Gospel: Cults, Alternative Religions, and the New Age Movement'' by Ruth A.

Indemnity is that which people do to restore themselves to God's kingdom. [[Young Oon Kim]] describes it this way: 'We atone for our sins through specific acts of penance.' Kwang-Yol Yoo, a Unification teacher, even goes so far as to say that by following the ''Divine Principle'', \"man's perfection must be accomplished by his own effort without God's help.\" God does most of the work, but people must still do their part in order to achieve God's plan of salvation: 'Five percent is only to say that man's responsibility is extremely small compared to God's.' \"p35 \"The doctrine of indemnity is not biblical. 'In simple language.' states Ruth Tucker, 'indemnity is salvation by works.' Bob Larson makes a distinction between Moon's doctrine and biblical theology, saying, 'Moon's doctrine of sinless perfection by \"indemnity [forgiveness of sin by works on Moon's behalf], which can apply even to deceased ancestors, is a denial of the salvation by grace offering through Jesus Christ.'

Restitution-in the sense of a \"natural law\"-assuages resentment, because it is the means by which the powerful and enfranchised give the people who feel downtrodden and powerless what they believe is rightly theirs. Indemnity means that 'I'm here for you.'\"</ref><ref>[https://www.webcitation.org/query?url=http://www.geocities.com/unificationism/edp-restoration.html%23Part2&date=2009-10-25+23:34:40 ''Exposition of the Divine Principle'' 1996 Translation]</ref> The concept of indemnity is explained at the start of the second half of the ''Divine Principle'', \"Introduction to Restoration\":\n{{quote|What, then, is the meaning of restoration through indemnity? When someone has lost his original position or state, he must make some condition to be restored to it. The making of such conditions of restitution is called indemnity. .... God's work to restore people to their true, unfallen state by having them fulfill indemnity conditions is called the providence of restoration through indemnity.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">''Exposition of the Divine Principle''</ref>}}\n\nThe ''Divine Principle'' goes on to explain three types of indemnity conditions. Equal conditions of indemnity pay back the full value of what was lost. The [[Bible|biblical]] verse \"life for life, eye for eye, tooth for tooth\" (Exod.21:23-24) is quoted as an example of an equal indemnity condition. Lesser conditions of indemnity provide a benefit greater than the price that is paid. [[Faith]], [[baptism]], and the [[eucharist]] are mentioned as examples of lesser indemnity conditions. Greater conditions of indemnity come about when a person fails in a lesser condition. In that case a greater price must be paid to make up for the earlier failure. [[Abraham]]'s attempted sacrifice of his son [[Isaac]] (Gen. 22:1-18) and the [[Israelites]]' 40 years of wandering in the wilderness under [[Moses]] (Num.14:34) are mentioned as examples of greater indemnity conditions.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/> The ''Divine Principle'' then explains that an indemnity condition must reverse the course by which the mistake or loss came about. Indemnity, at its core, is required of humans because God is pure, and purity cannot relate directly with impurity. Indemnification is the vehicle that allows a \"just and righteous\" God to work through mankind. [[Jesus]]' statement that God had forsaken him (Matt.27:46) and [[Christianity]]'s history of [[martyr]]dom are mentioned as examples of this.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/> The ''Divine Principle'' then states that human beings, not God or the [[angel]]s, are the ones responsible for making indemnity conditions.<ref>Yamamoto, J.

The character for 'seung' means 'ascending, elevation'. The character 'hwa' has meanings of 'harmony and peace.'

It is emphasized that the ceremony should have a joyful atmosphere since it is a celebration of the person's life and his or her transition to the spirit world.

Central to Unification teachings is the concept that [[fall of man|fallen humanity]] can be restored to [[God]] only through a messiah, who comes as a new [[Adam]] to become the new head of the human race, replacing the sinful parents, through whom mankind can be reborn into God's family. According to the religion, Jesus is this messiah,<ref name=\"Sontag102\"/> but his premature execution (before he could start a family) meant that his messianic role as the head of a sinless new humanity was passed on to Moon.\n\nIn 1980 Unification theologian [[Young Oon Kim]] wrote:\n{{quote|Unification theology teaches that Jesus came to establish the kingdom of heaven on earth. As St. Paul wrote, Jesus was to be the new Adam restoring the lost garden of Eden. For this purpose he chose twelve apostles, symbolizing the original twelve tribes of Israel, and sent out seventy disciples, symbolizing all the nations of the world. Like John the Baptist, Jesus proclaimed that the long-awaited kingdom of heaven was at hand (Matt. 4:17).  Jesus was appointed God's earthly representative in order to subjugate Satan, cleanse men of original sin and free them from the power of evil. Christ's mission involved liberation from sin and raising mankind to the perfection stage. His purpose was to bring about the kingdom of heaven in our world with the help of men filled with divine truth and love. Jesus' goal was to restore the garden of Eden, a place of joy and beauty in which true families of perfected parents would dwell with God in a full relationship of reciprocal love.<ref>Kim, Young Oon, 1980, [http://www.religious.org/ucbooks/UTheol/toc.htm Unification Theology], Barrytown, NY: [[Unification Theological Seminary]], Library of Congress Cataloging number 80-52872</ref>}}\n\nThe Unification movement view of Jesus has been criticized by mainstream Christian authors and theologians. In their influential book ''[[The Kingdom of the Cults]]'' (first published in 1965), Walter Ralston Martin and Ravi K. Zacharias disagreed with the ''Divine Principle'' on the issues of the [[divinity of Christ]], the [[virgin birth of Jesus]], the Unification Church's belief that Jesus should have married and a literal [[resurrection of Jesus]] as well as a literal [[Second Coming]].  They add: \"Moon makes all men equal in 'divinity' to Jesus, thereby striking a blow at the uniqueness of Christ.\"<ref>Walter Ralston Martin, Ravi K. Zacharias, ''The Kingdom of the Cults'', Bethany House, 2003, {{ISBN|0764228218}}  pages 368-370</ref>\n\nThe ''Divine Principle'' responds to this criticism  by saying:\n{{quote|There is no greater value than that of a person who has realized the ideal of creation. This is the value of Jesus, who surely attained the highest imaginable value. The conventional Christian belief in Jesus' divinity is well founded because, as a perfect human being, Jesus is totally one with God.

When someone has lost his original position or state, he must make some condition to be restored to it. The making of such conditions of restitution is called indemnity. .... God's work to restore people to their true, unfallen state by having them fulfill indemnity conditions is called the providence of restoration through indemnity.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">''Exposition of the Divine Principle''</ref>}}\n\nThe ''Divine Principle'' goes on to explain three types of indemnity conditions. Equal conditions of indemnity pay back the full value of what was lost. The [[Bible|biblical]] verse \"life for life, eye for eye, tooth for tooth\" (Exod.21:23-24) is quoted as an example of an equal indemnity condition. Lesser conditions of indemnity provide a benefit greater than the price that is paid. [[Faith]], [[baptism]], and the [[eucharist]] are mentioned as examples of lesser indemnity conditions. Greater conditions of indemnity come about when a person fails in a lesser condition. In that case a greater price must be paid to make up for the earlier failure. [[Abraham]]'s attempted sacrifice of his son [[Isaac]] (Gen. 22:1-18) and the [[Israelites]]' 40 years of wandering in the wilderness under [[Moses]] (Num.14:34) are mentioned as examples of greater indemnity conditions.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/> The ''Divine Principle'' then explains that an indemnity condition must reverse the course by which the mistake or loss came about. Indemnity, at its core, is required of humans because God is pure, and purity cannot relate directly with impurity. Indemnification is the vehicle that allows a \"just and righteous\" God to work through mankind. [[Jesus]]' statement that God had forsaken him (Matt.27:46) and [[Christianity]]'s history of [[martyr]]dom are mentioned as examples of this.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/> The ''Divine Principle'' then states that human beings, not God or the [[angel]]s, are the ones responsible for making indemnity conditions.<ref>Yamamoto, J.

Sometimes called \"the quiet Beatle\", Harrison embraced Indian culture and helped broaden the scope of [[popular music]] through his incorporation of Indian instrumentation and [[Hinduism|Hindu]]-aligned spirituality in the Beatles' work.{{sfn|Gilmore|2002|pp=34, 36}} Although the majority of the band's songs were written by [[Lennon\u2013McCartney|John Lennon and Paul McCartney]], most Beatles albums from 1965 onwards contained at least two Harrison compositions. His songs for the group included \"[[Taxman]]\", \"[[Within You Without You]]\", \"[[While My Guitar Gently Weeps]]\", \"[[Here Comes the Sun]]\" and \"[[Something (Beatles song)|Something]]\".\n\nHarrison's earliest musical influences included [[George Formby]] and [[Django Reinhardt]]; [[Carl Perkins]], [[Chet Atkins]] and [[Chuck Berry]] were subsequent influences. By 1965, he had begun to lead the Beatles into [[folk rock]] through his interest in [[Bob Dylan]] and [[the Byrds]], and towards [[Indian classical music]] through his use of the [[sitar]] on \"[[Norwegian Wood (This Bird Has Flown)]]\". Having initiated the band's embracing of [[Transcendental Meditation]] in 1967, he subsequently developed an association with the [[International Society for Krishna Consciousness|Hare Krishna movement]]. After [[Break-up of the Beatles|the band's break-up]] in 1970, Harrison released the triple album ''[[All Things Must Pass]]'', a critically acclaimed work that produced his most successful hit single, \"[[My Sweet Lord]]\", and introduced his signature sound as a solo artist, the [[slide guitar]]. He also organised the 1971 [[The Concert for Bangladesh|Concert for Bangladesh]] with Indian musician [[Ravi Shankar]], a precursor to later [[benefit concert]]s such as [[Live Aid]]. In his role as a music and film producer, Harrison produced acts signed to the Beatles' [[Apple Records|Apple]] record label before founding [[Dark Horse Records]] in 1974 and co-founding [[HandMade Films]] in 1978.\n\nHarrison released several best-selling singles and albums as a solo performer. In 1988, he co-founded the [[RIAA certification|platinum-selling]] [[Supergroup (music)|supergroup]] the [[Traveling Wilburys]]. A prolific recording artist, he was featured as a guest guitarist on tracks by [[Badfinger]], [[Ronnie Wood]] and [[Billy Preston]], and collaborated on songs and music with Dylan, [[Eric Clapton]], [[Ringo Starr]] and [[Tom Petty]], among others. ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' magazine ranked him number 11 in their list of the \"100 Greatest Guitarists of All Time\". He is a two-time [[Rock and Roll Hall of Fame]] inductee \u2013 as a member of the Beatles in 1988, and posthumously for his solo career in 2004.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://radio.com/2014/12/16/green-day-joan-jett-ringo-starr-lead-rock-hall-2015-inductees|title=2015 Rock Hall inductees|publisher=Radio.com|accessdate=16 December 2014|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141217154623/http://radio.com/2014/12/16/green-day-joan-jett-ringo-starr-lead-rock-hall-2015-inductees/|archivedate=17 December 2014}}</ref>\n\nHarrison's first marriage, to model [[Pattie Boyd]] in 1966, ended in divorce in 1977.

1943&nbsp;\u2013 29 November 2001) was an English musician, singer-songwriter, and music and film producer who achieved international fame as the lead guitarist of [[the Beatles]]. Sometimes called \"the quiet Beatle\", Harrison embraced Indian culture and helped broaden the scope of [[popular music]] through his incorporation of Indian instrumentation and [[Hinduism|Hindu]]-aligned spirituality in the Beatles' work.{{sfn|Gilmore|2002|pp=34, 36}} Although the majority of the band's songs were written by [[Lennon\u2013McCartney|John Lennon and Paul McCartney]], most Beatles albums from 1965 onwards contained at least two Harrison compositions. His songs for the group included \"[[Taxman]]\", \"[[Within You Without You]]\", \"[[While My Guitar Gently Weeps]]\", \"[[Here Comes the Sun]]\" and \"[[Something (Beatles song)|Something]]\".\n\nHarrison's earliest musical influences included [[George Formby]] and [[Django Reinhardt]]; [[Carl Perkins]], [[Chet Atkins]] and [[Chuck Berry]] were subsequent influences. By 1965, he had begun to lead the Beatles into [[folk rock]] through his interest in [[Bob Dylan]] and [[the Byrds]], and towards [[Indian classical music]] through his use of the [[sitar]] on \"[[Norwegian Wood (This Bird Has Flown)]]\". Having initiated the band's embracing of [[Transcendental Meditation]] in 1967, he subsequently developed an association with the [[International Society for Krishna Consciousness|Hare Krishna movement]]. After [[Break-up of the Beatles|the band's break-up]] in 1970, Harrison released the triple album ''[[All Things Must Pass]]'', a critically acclaimed work that produced his most successful hit single, \"[[My Sweet Lord]]\", and introduced his signature sound as a solo artist, the [[slide guitar]]. He also organised the 1971 [[The Concert for Bangladesh|Concert for Bangladesh]] with Indian musician [[Ravi Shankar]], a precursor to later [[benefit concert]]s such as [[Live Aid]]. In his role as a music and film producer, Harrison produced acts signed to the Beatles' [[Apple Records|Apple]] record label before founding [[Dark Horse Records]] in 1974 and co-founding [[HandMade Films]] in 1978.\n\nHarrison released several best-selling singles and albums as a solo performer. In 1988, he co-founded the [[RIAA certification|platinum-selling]] [[Supergroup (music)|supergroup]] the [[Traveling Wilburys]]. A prolific recording artist, he was featured as a guest guitarist on tracks by [[Badfinger]], [[Ronnie Wood]] and [[Billy Preston]], and collaborated on songs and music with Dylan, [[Eric Clapton]], [[Ringo Starr]] and [[Tom Petty]], among others. ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' magazine ranked him number 11 in their list of the \"100 Greatest Guitarists of All Time\". He is a two-time [[Rock and Roll Hall of Fame]] inductee \u2013 as a member of the Beatles in 1988, and posthumously for his solo career in 2004.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://radio.com/2014/12/16/green-day-joan-jett-ringo-starr-lead-rock-hall-2015-inductees|title=2015 Rock Hall inductees|publisher=Radio.com|accessdate=16 December 2014|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141217154623/http://radio.com/2014/12/16/green-day-joan-jett-ringo-starr-lead-rock-hall-2015-inductees/|archivedate=17 December 2014}}</ref>\n\nHarrison's first marriage, to model [[Pattie Boyd]] in 1966, ended in divorce in 1977. The following year he married [[Olivia Harrison|Olivia Arias]], with whom he had a son, [[Dhani Harrison|Dhani]]. Harrison died from lung cancer in 2001 at the age of 58, two years after surviving a knife attack by an intruder at his [[Friar Park]] home. His remains were cremated and the ashes were scattered according to [[Ganga in Hinduism|Hindu tradition]] in a private ceremony in the [[Ganges]] and [[Yamuna]] rivers in India.

The explosion killed Angela Taylor, the first Australian policewoman to be killed in the line of duty. The materials for the bomb were stolen from Tyrconnel Mine. Several men were arrested for suspected involvement with the bombing. Stanley Taylor and Craig Minogue were convicted of murder and various other offences related to the bombing.  Peter Reed and Rodney Minogue were acquitted of any offences related to the bombing but Reed was convicted of a number of offences related to his arrest, which involved a shootout with police officers injuring himself and an officer. He was sentenced to 12 years imprisonment.\n\n==Explosion==\n[[File:1978-1980 Holden VB Commodore 01.jpg|thumb|left|A Holden Commodore, like the one used in the Russell Street bombing]]\nThe explosion was caused by a [[car bomb]] hidden in a stolen 1979 [[Holden Commodore]], (bearing Victoria [[Vehicle registration plates of Victoria | registration plate]]; AVQ-508). The explosion caused a massive amount of damage to the police station and surrounding buildings, estimated at more than A$1&nbsp;million. The Melbourne newspaper ''[[The Age]]'' reported that the blast's impact was enhanced by the open-floor design of the offices, which had acted like a [[M18A1 Claymore Antipersonnel Mine|Claymore mine]], sending more shrapnel as the blast ripped through the floors and adding more pressure to the blast as it followed its path. The blast seriously injured 21-year-old  [[Constable|Police Constable]] Angela Taylor, who died on 20 April, becoming the first Australian policewoman to be killed in the line of duty.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.theage.com.au/articles/2006/03/24/1143083990293.html|title=Remembering the day Russell Street shook|work=The Age|date=25 March 2006|accessdate=12 March 2008}}</ref><ref>[http://www.abc.net.au/news/2016-03-24/scars-still-felt-20-years-after-russell-street-bombing/7264058 Scars still felt 30 years after Russell Street bombing], [[Australian Broadcasting Corporation]], 24 March 2016</ref> 22 other people were injured.\n{{clear left}}\n\n==Investigations==\nOn 7 October 1985, [[gelignite]] and [[detonator]]s were stolen from the Tyrconnel Mine at Blackwood. On 25 March 1986, a Holden Commodore was stolen. Both crimes were later found to provide equipment needed for the construction of the bomb.{{cn|date=August 2016}}\n\nIn the course of the investigation a group of people, including [[Craig Minogue]], Rodney Minogue, Stanley Brian Taylor and Peter Reed, were apprehended. The motive for the bombing seems to have been revenge against the police<ref>[http://www.slv.vic.gov.au/ergo/russell_street_bombing The Russell Street bombing], slv.vic.gov.au; accessed 10 February 2016.</ref>.\n\nA week after the bombing, on the 4 April 1986, a anonymous caller had contacted Police Commissioner; [[Mick Miller (police officer) | Mick Miller]] stating that they had footage of the offenders responsible just before the explosion, the caller then stated they wanted [[Australian dollar | AU$]]500,000 for the information. The caller called Commissioner Miller's office five times, the detectives traced the calls coming from a series of [[Telephone booth | public phone boxes]] in the [[St. Kilda, Victoria | St. Kilda]] area. In an attempt to get the caller to make contact, Commissioner Miller and Victoria's [[Premier of Victoria | Premier]]; [[John Cain (41st Premier of Victoria) | John Cain]] announced the $500,000 as a reward. The caller was later identified as 38 year-old industrial chemist; Vladimir Rhychta who was arrested while calling Commissioner Miller's office from a public phone box by a St. Kilda detective on the 16 April 1986 and charged with hindering a police investigation as it was found that Rhychta's information was false.<ref name=\"Foresnic\">''Forensic Investigators'' - ''S02 Ep06 Russell Street Bombing''</ref><ref>[http://www.timetoast.com/timelines/the-events-of-the-russell-street-bombing The Events of the Russell Street Bombing], timetoast.com</ref>\n\nThe taskforce then received information from a second witness who stated that they seen a male suspect parking a Commodore identical to the bomb car at around 12:30pm on the day of the bombing, the witness' description was enough to provide detectives with an [[identikit]] picture of the suspect, the identikit matched the description of career criminal; Claudio Crupi. Crupi was a career armed robber who had a hatred towards police, prior to the bombing, Crupi had been charged with a burglary and was on bail.<ref>{{Cite news |url=http://www.theage.com.au/national/victoria/the-day-terror-came-to-melbourne-the-russell-street-bombing-30-years-on-and-the-murder-of-angela-taylor-20160223-gn15xs.html|title=The day terror came to Melbourne: The Russell Street Bombing 30 years on and the murder of Angela Taylor|last=Silvester|first=John|date=2016-02-23|work=The Age|language=en-US}}</ref> In a raid on Crupi's home, taskforce detectives found a homemade device on Crupi's kitchen table. Crupi was later arrested by detectives in Sydney and was brought back to Melbourne. Under police questioning, Crupi admitted that he had a hatred towards a detective who worked at Russell Street but stated that the homemade device recovered in his home was a fake and was meant to planted at a police station in [[Flemington, Victoria | Flemington]].\n\nA major breakthrough in the investigation came from a police report filed three weeks prior to the bombing. On the 6 March 1986, a Victoria  Police Traffic unit was in pursuit of a stolen red [[Daimler Sovereign]] in [[East Keilor, Victoria | East Keilor]], the pursuit came to the end when the Daimler crashed. The driver fled on foot for a few kilometres where he carjacked a passing motorist at gunpoint. In the boot of the Daimler, police found a [[backpack]], containing a set of [[Vehicle registration plates of Victoria | number plates]] that had been cut into pieces. The pieces of the number plates; CCH-997 matched to a silver [[Holden Commodore (VK) | VK Commodore]] that had also been stolen before the bombing. This second Commodore matched the description of a vehicle being used in a armed robbery of a bank in [[Donvale, Victoria | Donvale]] hours after the bombing in which the Commodore was used to crash into the front window of the bank. The vehicle was later recovered from the [[Yarra River]] at [[Wonga Park, Victoria | Wonga Park]] on the 7 April 1986. \n\nUpon the examination of the silver Commodore by the Victoria Police Stolen Motor Vehicles Squad, detectives discovered that the vehicle's [[Vehicle identification number | VIN]] on the chassis had been drilled out. The drill marks on the silver Commodore's VIN were found to be identical to the VIN on the Commodore used in the bombing and the silver Commodore's number plates were recovered from the Daimler, linking the stolen Daimler and the Donvale robbery to the Russell Street Bombing.  \n\nIn a statement given to the detectives, the traffic officer caught a glimpse of the driver from the Daimler during the chase and out of a series of mugshots, identified the driver as Peter Reed. Reed (born Peter Komiazyk) was a suspected armed robber and car thief.<ref>''The Russell Street Bombing''</ref> As Reed was a person of interest in several armed robberies and car thefts, his address and the addresses of Reed's family members and several of his associates were placed under police surveillance.\n\n==Arrests==\nOn 25 April 1986, ten [[Victoria Police]] officers raided the [[Kallista, Victoria|Kallista]] home of Peter Michael Reed at 5:45 a.m. It was alleged that upon attempting to enforce the arrest by forcing entry to the premises, Reed produced a [[.455]] [[Smith & Wesson]] [[revolver]] and fired at police, seriously wounding Detective Sergeant Mark Wylie. Reed was then fired upon by Det. Sgt. Quinsee, who was also wounded and arrested.\n\n==Trial==\nReed was charged with attempted murder, recklessly causing serious injury, using a firearm to prevent apprehension and possessing explosives in suspicious circumstances in addition to charges related to the Russell Street bombing. Reed later reportedly stated at his trial in unsworn evidence that ''\"the police started the shooting and I only used [my] firearm in self defence.\"''\n\nThe Crown did not allege that any person played any particular role in the bombing, but that each of them were members of a team which planned the bombing and caused the bomb to explode. Evidence against the accused was as follows:\n* Gelignite and detonators used in the construction of the bomb were of the same type as those stolen from a mine.\n* Gelignite was found at Reed's house wrapped in newspaper containing [[fingerprint]]s belonging to Rodney Minogue.\n* Craig Minogue owned a pair of side cutters which produced cuts similar to those found on detonator wires.\n* a file with traces of brass deposits matched with brass deposits found at the bomb site.\n* a block of wood from which a wooden part of the bomb had been sawn was found at Craig Minogue's premises.\n* tinned copper wire, similar to that used with detonators found at the bomb site, was found at Craig Minogue's premises.\n* residue of gelignite matched residue found at a previous address of Craig Minogue in Lower [[Templestowe]].\n* evidence from a witness that Craig Minogue called around Easter 1986, to ask about the use of detonators.\n* a witness testified that Craig Minogue was seen driving a 1979 Holden Commodore around the CBD prior to the explosion.\n* another witness testified that before the bombing, that they discovered a box of explosives at a house they shared with the Minogue Brothers and was told by Craig Minogue to \"forget what they seen\".\n\nAt the end of a six month trial in the Supreme Court of Victoria in 1988 before His Honour Justice Vincent, Taylor and Craig Minogue were convicted of murder and various other offences related to the bombing.

The explosion killed Angela Taylor, the first Australian policewoman to be killed in the line of duty. The materials for the bomb were stolen from Tyrconnel Mine. Several men were arrested for suspected involvement with the bombing. Stanley Taylor and Craig Minogue were convicted of murder and various other offences related to the bombing.

The explosion caused a massive amount of damage to the police station and surrounding buildings, estimated at more than A$1&nbsp;million. The Melbourne newspaper ''[[The Age]]'' reported that the blast's impact was enhanced by the open-floor design of the offices, which had acted like a [[M18A1 Claymore Antipersonnel Mine|Claymore mine]], sending more shrapnel as the blast ripped through the floors and adding more pressure to the blast as it followed its path. The blast seriously injured 21-year-old  [[Constable|Police Constable]] Angela Taylor, who died on 20 April, becoming the first Australian policewoman to be killed in the line of duty.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.theage.com.au/articles/2006/03/24/1143083990293.html|title=Remembering the day Russell Street shook|work=The Age|date=25 March 2006|accessdate=12 March 2008}}</ref><ref>[http://www.abc.net.au/news/2016-03-24/scars-still-felt-20-years-after-russell-street-bombing/7264058 Scars still felt 30 years after Russell Street bombing], [[Australian Broadcasting Corporation]], 24 March 2016</ref> 22 other people were injured.\n{{clear left}}\n\n==Investigations==\nOn 7 October 1985, [[gelignite]] and [[detonator]]s were stolen from the Tyrconnel Mine at Blackwood.

The motive for the bombing seems to have been revenge against the police<ref>[http://www.slv.vic.gov.au/ergo/russell_street_bombing The Russell Street bombing], slv.vic.gov.au; accessed 10 February 2016.</ref>.\n\nA week after the bombing, on the 4 April 1986, a anonymous caller had contacted Police Commissioner; [[Mick Miller (police officer) | Mick Miller]] stating that they had footage of the offenders responsible just before the explosion, the caller then stated they wanted [[Australian dollar | AU$]]500,000 for the information. The caller called Commissioner Miller's office five times, the detectives traced the calls coming from a series of [[Telephone booth | public phone boxes]] in the [[St. Kilda, Victoria | St. Kilda]] area. In an attempt to get the caller to make contact, Commissioner Miller and Victoria's [[Premier of Victoria | Premier]]; [[John Cain (41st Premier of Victoria) | John Cain]] announced the $500,000 as a reward. The caller was later identified as 38 year-old industrial chemist; Vladimir Rhychta who was arrested while calling Commissioner Miller's office from a public phone box by a St. Kilda detective on the 16 April 1986 and charged with hindering a police investigation as it was found that Rhychta's information was false.<ref name=\"Foresnic\">''Forensic Investigators'' - ''S02 Ep06 Russell Street Bombing''</ref><ref>[http://www.timetoast.com/timelines/the-events-of-the-russell-street-bombing The Events of the Russell Street Bombing], timetoast.com</ref>\n\nThe taskforce then received information from a second witness who stated that they seen a male suspect driving a Commodore identical to the bomb car just before the bombing, the witness' description was enough to provide detectives with an [[identikit]] picture of the suspect, the identikit matched the description of career criminal; Claudio Crupi. Crupi was a career armed robber who had a hatred towards police, prior to the bombing, Crupi had been charged with a burglary and was on bail.<ref>{{Cite news |url=http://www.theage.com.au/national/victoria/the-day-terror-came-to-melbourne-the-russell-street-bombing-30-years-on-and-the-murder-of-angela-taylor-20160223-gn15xs.html|title=The day terror came to Melbourne: The Russell Street Bombing 30 years on and the murder of Angela Taylor|last=Silvester|first=John|date=2016-02-23|work=The Age|language=en-US}}</ref> In a raid on Crupi's home, taskforce detectives found a homemade device on Crupi's kitchen table. Crupi was later arrested by detectives in Sydney and was brought back to Melbourne. Under police questioning, Crupi admitted that he had a hatred towards a detective who worked at Russell Street but stated that the homemade device recovered in his home was a fake and was meant to planted at a police station in [[Flemington, Victoria | Flemington]].\n\nA major breakthrough in the investigation came from a police report filed three weeks prior to the bombing. On the 6 March 1986, a Victoria  Police Traffic unit was in pursuit of a stolen red [[Daimler Sovereign]] in [[East Keilor, Victoria | East Keilor]], the pursuit came to the end when the Daimler crashed. The driver fled on foot for a few kilometres where he carjacked a passing motorist at gunpoint. In the boot of the Daimler, police found a [[backpack]], containing a set of [[Vehicle registration plates of Victoria | number plates]] that had been cut into pieces. The pieces of the number plates; CCH-997 matched to a silver [[Holden Commodore (VK) | VK Commodore]] that had also been stolen before the bombing. This second Commodore matched the description of a vehicle being used in a armed robbery of a bank in [[Donvale, Victoria | Donvale]] hours after the bombing in which the Commodore was used to crash into the front window of the bank. The vehicle was later recovered from the [[Yarra River]] at [[Wonga Park, Victoria | Wonga Park]] on the 7 April 1986. \n\nUpon the examination of the silver Commodore by the Victoria Police Stolen Motor Vehicles Squad, detectives discovered that the vehicle's [[Vehicle identification number | VIN]] on the chassis had been drilled out. The drill marks on the silver Commodore's VIN were found to be identical to the VIN on the Commodore used in the bombing and the silver Commodore's number plates were recovered from the Daimler, linking the stolen Daimler and the Donvale robbery to the Russell Street Bombing.  \n\nIn a statement given to the detectives, the traffic officer caught a glimpse of the driver from the Daimler during the chase and out of a series of mugshots, identified the driver as Peter Reed. Reed (born Peter Komiazyk) was a suspected armed robber and car thief.<ref>''The Russell Street Bombing''</ref> As Reed was a person of interest in several armed robberies and car thefts, his address and the addresses of Reed's family members and several of his associates were placed under police surveillance.\n\n==Arrests==\nOn 25 April 1986, ten [[Victoria Police]] officers raided the [[Kallista, Victoria|Kallista]] home of Peter Michael Reed at 5:45 a.m. It was alleged that upon attempting to enforce the arrest by forcing entry to the premises, Reed produced a [[.455]] [[Smith & Wesson]] [[revolver]] and fired at police, seriously wounding Detective Sergeant Mark Wylie. Reed was then fired upon by Det. Sgt. Quinsee, who was also wounded and arrested.\n\n==Trial==\nReed was charged with attempted murder, recklessly causing serious injury, using a firearm to prevent apprehension and possessing explosives in suspicious circumstances in addition to charges related to the Russell Street bombing. Reed later reportedly stated at his trial in unsworn evidence that ''\"the police started the shooting and I only used [my] firearm in self defence.\"''\n\nThe Crown did not allege that any person played any particular role in the bombing, but that each of them were members of a team which planned the bombing and caused the bomb to explode. Evidence against the accused was as follows:\n* Gelignite and detonators used in the construction of the bomb were of the same type as those stolen from a mine.\n* Gelignite was found at Reed's house wrapped in newspaper containing [[fingerprint]]s belonging to Rodney Minogue.\n* Craig Minogue owned a pair of side cutters which produced cuts similar to those found on detonator wires.\n* a file with traces of brass deposits matched with brass deposits found at the bomb site.\n* a block of wood from which a wooden part of the bomb had been sawn was found at Craig Minogue's premises.\n* tinned copper wire, similar to that used with detonators found at the bomb site, was found at Craig Minogue's premises.\n* residue of gelignite matched residue found at a previous address of Craig Minogue in Lower [[Templestowe]].\n* evidence from a witness that Craig Minogue called around Easter 1986, to ask about the use of detonators.\n* a witness testified that Craig Minogue was seen driving a 1979 Holden Commodore around the CBD prior to the explosion.\n* another witness testified that before the bombing, that they discovered a box of explosives at a house they shared with the Minogue Brothers and was told by Craig Minogue to \"forget what they seen\".\n\nAt the end of a six month trial in the Supreme Court of Victoria in 1988 before His Honour Justice Vincent, Taylor and Craig Minogue were convicted of murder and various other offences related to the bombing.  Peter Reed and Rodney Minogue were acquitted of any offences related to the bombing but Reed was convicted of a number of offences related to his arrest, and was sentenced to 12 years imprisonment.\n\nTaylor was sentenced to life imprisonment with no minimum term (ie never to be released), the first person in Victoria to be so sentenced.
