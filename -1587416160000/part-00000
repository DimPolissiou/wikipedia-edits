The best known of them were passed in big balls\n[Southern United States|Southern states]], after the [[American Civil War]], in order to restrict African Americans' freedom, and to compel them to work for low wages. However, Black Codes existed before the Civil War, and many Northern states had them. In 1832, \"in most of the United States, there is a distinction in respect to political privileges, between free white persons and free coloured persons of African blood; and in no part of the country do the latter, in point of fact, participate equally with the whites, in the exercise of civil and political rights.\"<ref>{{Cite book\n|first=James\n|last=Kent\n|title=Commentaries on American Law\n|year=1832\n|edition=2nd\n|volume=2\n|page=[https://archive.org/details/bub_gb_FVoZsc_TY5IC/page/n260 258]\n|location=New-York\n|publisher=O.

Black codes were essentially replacements for slave codes in those states. Before the war, Northern states that had prohibited slavery also enacted Black Codes: Connecticut, Ohio, Illinois, Indiana, Michigan,<ref name=\"The Black Laws: Race and the Legal Process in Early Ohio by Stephen K. Middleton\">'' The Black Laws: Race and the Legal Process in Early Ohio'' by Stephen Middleton. (2005. Ohio University Press) [https://www.ohioswallow.com/book/The+Black+Laws (https://www.ohioswallow.com/book/The+Black+Laws]</ref> and New York enacted laws to discourage free blacks from residing in those states. They were denied equal political rights, including the right to vote, the right to attend public schools, and the right to equal treatment under the law.  Some of the Northern states{{which|date=October 2019}} repealed such laws around the same time that the Civil War ended and slavery was abolished by constitutional amendment.\n\nSince the colonial period, colonies and states had passed laws that discriminated against [[Free negro|free Blacks]]. In the South, these were generally included in \"[[slave codes]]\"; the goal was to reduce the influence of free blacks (particularly after slave rebellions) because of their potential influence on slaves. Restrictions included prohibiting them from voting (although North Carolina had allowed this before 1831), bearing arms, gathering in groups for worship, and learning to read and write. The purpose of these laws was to preserve slavery in slave societies.\n\nIn the first two years after the Civil War, white-dominated Southern legislatures passed Black Codes modeled after the earlier slave codes. They were particularly concerned with controlling movement and labor of freedmen, as slavery had been replaced by a free labor system. Although freedmen had been emancipated, their lives were greatly restricted by the Black Codes.\n\nThe name Black Codes was given by \"negro leaders and the Republican organs\", according to historian John S. Reynolds.<ref>James Calvin Hemphill, \"John Schreiner Reynolds\", ''Men of Mark in South Carolina: Ideals of American Life'' Vol. II; Washington, D.C.: Men of Mark Publishing Co., 1908.</ref><ref>Kermit L.

Chattel slaves basically lived under the complete control of their owners, so there was little need for extensive legislation. \"All Southern states imposed at least minimal limits on slave punishment, for example, by making murder or life-threatening injury of slaves a crime, and a few states allowed slaves a limited right of self-defense.\"<ref name=Ranney15>Ranney, ''In the Wake of Slavery'' (2006), p. 15.</ref> As slaves could not use the courts or sheriff, or give testimony against a white man, in practice these meant little.\n\nNorth Carolina<sup>Only?</sup> restricted slaves from leaving their plantation; if a male slave tried to court (date) a female slave on another property, he needed a pass in order to pursue this relationship.

Both agencies preserved 'white man's rule,' and though both of them did, as George Bently said of the Freedmen's Bureau, 'maintain a fairly strong guard against any form of reenslavement of the Negroes', their interest in the welfare and happiness of the freedmen did not, as a whole, extend far beyond that safeguard in 1865 and 1866.

Although blacks did not all abruptly stop working, they did try to work less. In particular, many sought to reduce their Saturday work hours, and women wanted to spend more time on [[child care]].<ref>Wilson, ''Black Codes'' (1965), pp. 54\u201355. \"The larger problem, however, was labor for agriculture, the mainstay of the southern economy. Increasingly the freedmen, whose work day was from sunrise to sunset, refused to work more than a half day, if at all, on Saturday.&nbsp;... The greatest loss to the labor force resulted from the decision of growing numbers of negro women to devote their time to their homes and children.\"</ref> In the view of one contemporary economist, freed people exhibited this \"noncapitalist behavior\" because the condition of being owned had \"shielded the slaves from the [[market economy]]\" and they were therefore unable to perform \"careful calculation of economic opportunities\".<ref>Emmer, \"The Price of Freedom\" (1992), pp. 35\u201336.</ref>\n\nAn alternative explanation treats the labor slowdown as a form of gaining leverage through collective action.<ref>Cohen, ''At Freedom's Edge'' (1991), pp. 16\u201317.</ref> Another possibility is that freed blacks assigned value to leisure and family time in excess of the monetary value of additional paid labor. Indeed, freedpeople certainly did not ''want'' to work the long hours that had been forced upon them for their whole lives.<ref>Cohen, ''At Freedom's Edge'' (1991), p. 14.</ref> Whatever its causes, the sudden reduction of available labor posed a challenge to the Southern economy, which had relied upon intense physical labor to profitably harvest [[cash crop]]s, particularly [[King Cotton]].<ref>Emmer, \"The Price of Freedom\" (1992), p. 29.</ref>\n\nSouthern Whites also perceived Black vagrancy as a sudden and dangerous social problem.<ref>Wilson, ''Black Codes'' (1965), p. 53. \"Most southern towns were not very large and the influx of even a few hundred undoubtedly gave witnesses a false impression of the size of the movement.&nbsp;...

Of these, eight allowed [[Convict lease|convict leasing]] (a system in which state prison hired out convicts for labor) and five allowed prisoner labor for public works projects.<ref>Cohen, ''At Freedom's Edge'' (1991), p. 33. \"Of the nine states that adopted vagrancy laws in 1865 \u2013 1866, all except North Carolina provided for the hiring-out of [[vagrant]]s. These same states also enacted convict laws allowing for the hiring-out of other county prisoners who could not pay their fines and costs. In addition, Alabama, Georgia, South Carolina, Texas, and Virginia made it legal for county authorities to put prisoners to work on public projects such as roads and bridges.\"</ref> This created a system that established incentives to arrest black men, as convicts were supplied to local governments and planters as free workers. The planters or other supervisors were responsible for their board and food, and black convicts were kept in miserable conditions. As [[Douglas Blackmon]] wrote, it was \"slavery by another name\".<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/> Because of their reliance on convict leasing, Southern states did not build any prisons until the late 19th century.\n\nAnother important part of the Codes were the annual labor contracts, which Black people had to keep and present to authorities to avoid vagrancy charges.<ref name=Daniel96>Daniel, ''Metamorphosis of Slavery'' (1979), p. 96. \"The yearly contract was one of the most important elements in the landlord's control over labor \u2014 not what the contract stated explicitly, but what it implied and how it was executed.

Previously, Blacks had been part of the domestic economy on a plantation, and were more or less able to use supplies that were available.

McCall|Samuel McCall]], who published a biography of abolitionist [[Thaddeus Stevens]], commented in 1899 that the Black Codes had \"established a condition but little better than that of slavery, and in one important respect far worse\": by severing the property relationship, they had diminished the incentive for property owners to ensure the relative health and survival of their workers.<ref>[[Samuel W.

Quote: \"Generally, Restoration legislatures tried to preserve as many prewar restrictions as possible while making at least a slight bow to Northern public opinion.\"</ref> Even states that carefully eliminated most of the overt discrimination in their Black Codes retained laws authorizing harsher sentences for Black people.<ref name=\"ranney51\"/>\n\nMississippi was the first state to legislate a new Black Code after the war, beginning with \"An Act to confer Civil Rights on Freedmen\". This law allowed Blacks to rent land only within cities\u2014effectively preventing them from earning money through independent farming. It required Blacks to present, each January, written proof of employment. The law defined violation of this requirement as vagrancy, punishable by arrest\u2014for which the arresting officer would be paid $5, to be taken from the arrestee's wages. Provisions akin to [[fugitive slave laws]] mandated the return of runaway workers, who would lose their wages for the year.<ref name=paxson>Ellis Paxson Oberholtzer, ''A History of the United States since the Civil War'' (1917) 1:128\u2013129. Quote: \"Negroes must make [[Indentured servant|annual contracts for their labor]] in writing; if they should run away from their tasks, they forfeited their wages for the year. Whenever it was required of them they must present licenses (in a town from the mayor; elsewhere from a member of the board of police of the beat) citing their places of residence and authorizing them to work. Fugitives from labor were to be arrested and carried back to their employers. Five dollars a head and mileage would be allowed such negro catchers. It was made a misdemeanor, punishable with fine or imprisonment, to persuade a freedman to leave his employer, or to feed the runaway. Minors were to be apprenticed, if males until they were twenty-one, if females until eighteen years of age. Such corporal punishment as a father would administer to a child might be inflicted upon apprentices by their masters. Vagrants were to be fined heavily, and if they could not pay the sum, they were to be hired out to service until the claim was satisfied. Negroes must not carry knives or firearms unless they were licensed so to do. It was an offence, to be punished by a fine of $50 and imprisonment for thirty days, to give or sell intoxicating liquors to a negro. When negroes could not pay the fines and costs after legal proceedings, they were to be hired at public outcry by the sheriff to the lowest  bidder....\"</ref><ref name=Novak2 /><ref name=Forte601 />  An amended version of the vagrancy law included punishments for sympathetic whites:<ref name=Stewart2261 /><ref name=Novak2>Novak, ''Wheel of Servitude'' (1978), p. 2\u20133.</ref>\n\n<blockquote>That all freedmen, free negroes and mulattoes in this State, over the age of eighteen years, found on the second Monday in January, 1866, or thereafter, without lawful employment or business, or found unlawfully assembling themselves together, either in the day or night time, and all white persons so assembling themselves with freedmen, free negroes or mulattoes, or usually associating with freedmen, free negroes or mulattoes, on terms of equality, or living in adultery or fornication with a freed woman, free negro or mulatto, shall be deemed vagrants, and on conviction thereof shall be fined in a sum not exceeding, in the case of a freedman, free negro, or mulatto, fifty dollars, and a white man two hundred dollars, and imprisoned, at the discretion of the court, the free negro not exceeding ten days, and the white man not exceeding six months.</blockquote>\n\nWhites could avoid the code's penalty by swearing a [[pauper's oath]].

Conviction for vagrancy allowed the state to \"hire out\" blacks for no pay. The law also called for a special tax on blacks (all males and unmarried females), with non-paying blacks again guilty of vagrancy. The law enabled forcible apprenticeship of children of impoverished parents, or of parents who did not convey \"habits of industry and honesty\".<ref name=Novak4 /> The law did not include the same punishments for Whites in dealing with fugitives.<ref>Novak, ''Wheel of Servitude'' (1978), pp. 4\u20135. \"Notably, the use of criminal penalties to prevent the enticement of a servant or his harboring was not included in the South Carolina codes at this time.\"</ref>\n\nThe South Carolina law created separate courts for Black people, and authorized [[capital punishment]] for crimes including theft of cotton.<ref>DuBois, ''Black Reconstruction'' (1935), p.

Its vagrancy laws did not specify Black culprits, though they did provide a \"good behavior\" loophole subject to plausibly racist interpretation. Louisiana passed harsher fugitive worker laws and required blacks to present dismissal paperwork to new employers.<ref>Novak, ''Wheel of Servitude'' (1978), p. 5. \"The vagrancy law, which made no racial distinctions, was broadened in its compass, and provision was made for the hiring out of convicted vagrants (here an out was given to those who could convince a judge of their good behavior and future industry, obviously to provide a safety valve for convicted whites) and the penalty was  raised from six months to a year. Enticement, harboring, or employing 'runaway servants' was made a penal offense, and the legislature added a new twist, demanding that all employers be shown a written discharge from the laborer's former master.</ref>\n\nState legislation was amplified by local authorities, who ran less risk of backlash from the federal government.

By 1860, 45.6% of the black population in the state was already free. Former slave owners rushed to place the children of freedpeople in multi-year apprenticeships; the Freedmen's Bureau and some others tried to stop them. The legislature stripped Baltimore Judge [[Hugh Lennox Bond]] of his position because he cooperated with the Bureau in this matter.

It was called peonage after the labor practice in Mexico and through an unlikely set of circumstances violated an 1867 federal state in the United States.

Like emancipation, decolonization was a landmark political change\u2014but its significance, according to some historians, was tempered by the [[neocolonialism|continuity of economic exploitation]].<ref>Emmer, \"The Price of Freedom\" (1992), p. 23. \"By breaking their colonial links, the undeveloped or underdeveloped countries in Asia and Africa were expected to be able finally to follow the path of sustained economic growth that Europe and North America had walked in the past.

The best known of them were passed in 1865 and 1866 by [[Southern United States|Southern states]], after the [[American Civil War]], in order to restrict African Americans' freedom, and to compel them to work for low wages. However, Black Codes existed before the Civil War, and many Northern states had them. In 1832, \"in most of the United States, there is a distinction in respect to political privileges, between free white persons and free coloured persons of African blood; and in no part of the country do the latter, in point of fact, participate equally with the whites, in the exercise of civil and political rights.\"<ref>{{Cite book\n|first=James\n|last=Kent\n|title=Commentaries on American Law\n|year=1832\n|edition=2nd\n|volume=2\n|page=[https://archive.org/details/bub_gb_FVoZsc_TY5IC/page/n260 258]\n|location=New-York\n|publisher=O.

Black codes were essentially replacements for slave codes in those states. Before the war, Northern states that had prohibited slavery also enacted Black Codes: Connecticut, Ohio, Illinois, Indiana, Michigan,<ref name=\"The Black Laws: Race and the Legal Process in Early Ohio by Stephen K. Middleton\">'' The Black Laws: Race and the Legal Process in Early Ohio'' by Stephen Middleton. (2005. Ohio University Press) [https://www.ohioswallow.com/book/The+Black+Laws (https://www.ohioswallow.com/book/The+Black+Laws]</ref> and New York enacted laws to discourage free blacks from residing in those states. They were denied equal political rights, including the right to vote, the right to attend public schools, and the right to equal treatment under the law.  Some of the Northern states{{which|date=October 2019}} repealed such laws around the same time that the Civil War ended and slavery was abolished by constitutional amendment.\n\nSince the colonial period, colonies and states had passed laws that discriminated against [[Free negro|free Blacks]]. In the South, these were generally included in \"[[slave codes]]\"; the goal was to reduce the influence of free blacks (particularly after slave rebellions) because of their potential influence on slaves. Restrictions included prohibiting them from voting (although North Carolina had allowed this before 1831), bearing arms, gathering in groups for worship, and learning to read and write. The purpose of these laws was to preserve slavery in slave societies.\n\nIn the first two years after the Civil War, white-dominated Southern legislatures passed Black Codes modeled after the earlier slave codes. They were particularly concerned with controlling movement and labor of freedmen, as slavery had been replaced by a free labor system. Although freedmen had been emancipated, their lives were greatly restricted by the Black Codes.\n\nThe name Black Codes was given by \"negro leaders and the Republican organs\", according to historian John S. Reynolds.<ref>James Calvin Hemphill, \"John Schreiner Reynolds\", ''Men of Mark in South Carolina: Ideals of American Life'' Vol. II; Washington, D.C.: Men of Mark Publishing Co., 1908.</ref><ref>Kermit L.

Chattel slaves basically lived under the complete control of their owners, so there was little need for extensive legislation. \"All Southern states imposed at least minimal limits on slave punishment, for example, by making murder or life-threatening injury of slaves a crime, and a few states allowed slaves a limited right of self-defense.\"<ref name=Ranney15>Ranney, ''In the Wake of Slavery'' (2006), p. 15.</ref> As slaves could not use the courts or sheriff, or give testimony against a white man, in practice these meant little.\n\nNorth Carolina<sup>Only?</sup> restricted slaves from leaving their plantation; if a male slave tried to court (date) a female slave on another property, he needed a pass in order to pursue this relationship.

Both agencies preserved 'white man's rule,' and though both of them did, as George Bently said of the Freedmen's Bureau, 'maintain a fairly strong guard against any form of reenslavement of the Negroes', their interest in the welfare and happiness of the freedmen did not, as a whole, extend far beyond that safeguard in 1865 and 1866.

In particular, many sought to reduce their Saturday work hours, and women wanted to spend more time on [[child care]].<ref>Wilson, ''Black Codes'' (1965), pp. 54\u201355. \"The larger problem, however, was labor for agriculture, the mainstay of the southern economy. Increasingly the freedmen, whose work day was from sunrise to sunset, refused to work more than a half day, if at all, on Saturday.&nbsp;... The greatest loss to the labor force resulted from the decision of growing numbers of negro women to devote their time to their homes and children.\"</ref> In the view of one contemporary economist, freed people exhibited this \"noncapitalist behavior\" because the condition of being owned had \"shielded the slaves from the [[market economy]]\" and they were therefore unable to perform \"careful calculation of economic opportunities\".<ref>Emmer, \"The Price of Freedom\" (1992), pp. 35\u201336.</ref>\n\nAn alternative explanation treats the labor slowdown as a form of gaining leverage through collective action.<ref>Cohen, ''At Freedom's Edge'' (1991), pp. 16\u201317.</ref> Another possibility is that freed blacks assigned value to leisure and family time in excess of the monetary value of additional paid labor. Indeed, freedpeople certainly did not ''want'' to work the long hours that had been forced upon them for their whole lives.<ref>Cohen, ''At Freedom's Edge'' (1991), p. 14.</ref> Whatever its causes, the sudden reduction of available labor posed a challenge to the Southern economy, which had relied upon intense physical labor to profitably harvest [[cash crop]]s, particularly [[King Cotton]].<ref>Emmer, \"The Price of Freedom\" (1992), p. 29.</ref>\n\nSouthern Whites also perceived Black vagrancy as a sudden and dangerous social problem.<ref>Wilson, ''Black Codes'' (1965), p. 53. \"Most southern towns were not very large and the influx of even a few hundred undoubtedly gave witnesses a false impression of the size of the movement.&nbsp;...

Of these, eight allowed [[Convict lease|convict leasing]] (a system in which state prison hired out convicts for labor) and five allowed prisoner labor for public works projects.<ref>Cohen, ''At Freedom's Edge'' (1991), p. 33. \"Of the nine states that adopted vagrancy laws in 1865 \u2013 1866, all except North Carolina provided for the hiring-out of [[vagrant]]s. These same states also enacted convict laws allowing for the hiring-out of other county prisoners who could not pay their fines and costs. In addition, Alabama, Georgia, South Carolina, Texas, and Virginia made it legal for county authorities to put prisoners to work on public projects such as roads and bridges.\"</ref> This created a system that established incentives to arrest black men, as convicts were supplied to local governments and planters as free workers. The planters or other supervisors were responsible for their board and food, and black convicts were kept in miserable conditions. As [[Douglas Blackmon]] wrote, it was \"slavery by another name\".<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/> Because of their reliance on convict leasing, Southern states did not build any prisons until the late 19th century.\n\nAnother important part of the Codes were the annual labor contracts, which Black people had to keep and present to authorities to avoid vagrancy charges.<ref name=Daniel96>Daniel, ''Metamorphosis of Slavery'' (1979), p. 96. \"The yearly contract was one of the most important elements in the landlord's control over labor \u2014 not what the contract stated explicitly, but what it implied and how it was executed.

Previously, Blacks had been part of the domestic economy on a plantation, and were more or less able to use supplies that were available. After emancipation, the same act performed by someone working the same land might be labeled as theft, leading to arrest and involuntary labor.<ref>Forehand, ''Striking Resemblance'' (1996), pp. 59\u201360.</ref>\n\nSome states explicitly curtailed Black people's right to bear arms, justifying these laws with claims of imminent insurrection.<ref name=Richardson373 /><ref name=DuBois172>DuBois, ''Black Reconstruction'' (1935), p.

This law allowed Blacks to rent land only within cities\u2014effectively preventing them from earning money through independent farming. It required Blacks to present, each January, written proof of employment. The law defined violation of this requirement as vagrancy, punishable by arrest\u2014for which the arresting officer would be paid $5, to be taken from the arrestee's wages. Provisions akin to [[fugitive slave laws]] mandated the return of runaway workers, who would lose their wages for the year.<ref name=paxson>Ellis Paxson Oberholtzer, ''A History of the United States since the Civil War'' (1917) 1:128\u2013129.

Fugitives from labor were to be arrested and carried back to their employers. Five dollars a head and mileage would be allowed such negro catchers. It was made a misdemeanor, punishable with fine or imprisonment, to persuade a freedman to leave his employer, or to feed the runaway. Minors were to be apprenticed, if males until they were twenty-one, if females until eighteen years of age. Such corporal punishment as a father would administer to a child might be inflicted upon apprentices by their masters. Vagrants were to be fined heavily, and if they could not pay the sum, they were to be hired out to service until the claim was satisfied.

One planter suggested that the new laws would require paramilitary enforcement: \"As for making the negroes work under the present state of affairs it seems to me a waste of time and energy&nbsp;...

James Hemphill said: \"It will be hard to persuade the freedom shriekers that the American citizens of African descent are obtaining their rights.\"<ref>Williamson, ''After Slavery'' (1965), pp. 76\u201377.</ref> Orr moved to block further laws containing explicit racial discrimination.<ref>Williamson, ''After Slavery'' (1965), p. 77.</ref> In 1866, the South Carolina code came under increasing scrutiny in the Northern press and was compared unfavorably to freedmen's laws passed in neighboring Georgia, North Carolina, and Virginia.<ref>Williamson, ''After Slavery'' (1965), p. 78.</ref>\n\nIn a special session held in September 1866, the legislature passed some new laws in concession to the rights of free Blacks. Shortly after, it rejected the [[Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fourteenth Amendment]].<ref>Williamson, ''After Slavery'' (1965), p. 79.</ref>\n\n===Louisiana===\nThe Louisiana legislature, seeking to ensure that freedmen were \"available to the agricultural interests of the state\", passed similar yearly contract laws and expanded its vagrancy laws. Its vagrancy laws did not specify Black culprits, though they did provide a \"good behavior\" loophole subject to plausibly racist interpretation. Louisiana passed harsher fugitive worker laws and required blacks to present dismissal paperwork to new employers.<ref>Novak, ''Wheel of Servitude'' (1978), p. 5. \"The vagrancy law, which made no racial distinctions, was broadened in its compass, and provision was made for the hiring out of convicted vagrants (here an out was given to those who could convince a judge of their good behavior and future industry, obviously to provide a safety valve for convicted whites) and the penalty was  raised from six months to a year. Enticement, harboring, or employing 'runaway servants' was made a penal offense, and the legislature added a new twist, demanding that all employers be shown a written discharge from the laborer's former master.</ref>\n\nState legislation was amplified by local authorities, who ran less risk of backlash from the federal government. [[Opelousas, Louisiana]], passed a notorious code which required freedpeople to have written authorization to enter the town. The code prevented freedpeople from living in the town or walking at night except under supervision of a White resident.<ref name=DuBois177>DuBois, ''Black Reconstruction'' (1935), p. [https://archive.org/stream/blackreconstruc00dubo#page/176/mode/2up 177].</ref>\n\n[[Thomas W. Conway]], the Freedmen's Bureau commissioner for Louisiana, testified in 1866:<ref name=DuBois178>DuBois, ''Black Reconstruction'' (1935), p. [https://archive.org/stream/blackreconstruc00dubo#page/178/mode/2up 178].</ref>\n<blockquote>Some of the leading officers of the state down there\u2014men who do much to form and control the opinions of the masses\u2014instead of doing as they promised, and quietly submitting to the authority of the government, engaged in issuing slave codes and in promulgating them to their subordinates, ordering them to carry them into execution, and this to the knowledge of state officials of a higher character, the governor and others.&nbsp;... These codes were simply the old black code of the state, with the word 'slave' expunged, and 'Negro' substituted. The most odious features of slavery were preserved in them.</blockquote>\n\nConway describes surveying the Louisiana jails and finding large numbers of Black men who had been secretly incarcerated. These included members of the Seventy-Fourth Colored Infantry who had been arrested the day after they were discharged.<ref name=DuBois178 />\n\nThe state passed a harsher version of its code in 1866, criminalizing \"impudence\", \"swearing\", and other signs of \"disobedience\" as determined by whites.<ref name=\"Forte603\"/>\n\n===Florida===\nOf the Black Codes passed in 1866 (after the Northern reaction had become apparent), only Florida's rivaled those of Mississippi and South Carolina in severity.<ref>Richardson, \"Florida Black Codes\" (1969), p. 365.</ref> Florida's slaveowners seemed to hold out hope that the institution of slavery would simply be restored.<ref>Richardson, \"Florida Black Codes\" (1969), p. 366.</ref> Advised by the [[Governor of Florida|Florida governor]] and [[Attorney General of Florida|attorney general]] as well as by the Freedmen's Bureau that it could not constitutionally revoke Black people's right to bear arms, the Florida legislature refused to repeal this part of the codes.<ref name=Richardson373>Richardson, \"Florida Black Codes\" (1969), p. 373.</ref>\n\nThe Florida vagrancy law allowed for punishments of up to one year of labor.<ref name=Richarson374 /> Children whose parents were convicted of vagrancy could be hired out as apprentices.<ref>Richardson, \"Florida Black Codes\" (1969), p. 375.</ref>\n\nThese laws applied to any \"person of color\", which was defined as someone with [[octaroon|at least one Negro great-grandparent]], or one-eighth black ancestry.<ref name=Richarson374 >Richardson, ''Florida Black Codes'' (1969), p. 374.</ref> White women could not live with men of color.<ref name=Richarson374 /> Colored workers could be punished for disrespecting White employers.<ref name=\"Forte603\"/> The explicit racism in the law was supplemented by racist [[enforcement discretion]] (and other inequalities) in the practice of law enforcement and legal systems.<ref>Richardson, ''Florida Black Codes'' (1969), pp. 376\u2013377.</ref>\n\n===Maryland===\nIn Maryland, a fierce battle began immediately after emancipation (by the [[Maryland Constitution of 1864]]) over requiring apprenticeship of young black people. By 1860, 45.6% of the black population in the state was already free. Former slave owners rushed to place the children of freedpeople in multi-year apprenticeships; the Freedmen's Bureau and some others tried to stop them. The legislature stripped Baltimore Judge [[Hugh Lennox Bond]] of his position because he cooperated with the Bureau in this matter. [[Salmon Chase]], as Chief Justice of the [[United States Supreme Court]], eventually overruled the Maryland apprentice laws on the grounds of their violation of the [[Civil Rights Act of 1866]].<ref>{{Cite book |first=Joseph A. |last=Ranney |title=In the Wake of Slavery |year=2006 |isbn=0-275-98972-0 |publisher=Praeger |page=48}}</ref>\n\n===North Carolina===\nNorth Carolina's Black Code specified racial differences in punishment, establishing harsher sentences for Blacks convicted of rape.<ref name=DuBois177 />\n\n===Texas===\nThe Texas Constitutional Convention met in February 1866, declined to ratify the (already effective) Thirteenth Amendment, provided that Blacks would be \"protected in their rights of person and property by appropriate legislation\" and guaranteed some degree of rights to testify in court.<ref>Crouch, \"All the Vile Passions\" (1993), p. 21.</ref> Texas modeled its laws on South Carolina's.<ref name=Ranney46 />\n\nThe legislature defined Negroes as people with at least one African great-grandparent.<ref name=Crouch23 /> Negroes could choose their employer, before a deadline. After they had made a contract, they were bound to it. If they quit \"without cause of permission\" they would lose all of their wages.<ref name=Crouch24>Crouch, \"All the Vile Passions\" (1993), p. 24.</ref> Workers could be fined $1 for acts of disobedience or negligence, and 25 cents per hour for missed work.<ref name=Crouch24 /> The legislature also created a system of apprenticeship (with corporal punishment) and vagrancy laws.<ref name=Crouch28>Crouch, \"All the Vile Passions\" (1993), pp. 26\u201328.</ref> Convict labor could be hired out or used in public works.<ref name=Crouch30 />\n\nNegroes were not allowed to vote, hold office, sit on juries, serve in local militia, carry guns on plantations, homestead, or attend public schools. Interracial marriage was banned.<ref name=Crouch23>Crouch, \"All the Vile Passions\" (1993), p. 23. \"The legislature prohibited blacks from marrying whites or testifying against them, serving on juries, holding office, voting, homesteading on the public domain, and serving in the militia, and confined public education to white children. It provisionally authorized the Board of Managers to purchase twenty-six acres of land for a '[[Lunatic Asylum]]' for the benefit of 'Insane Negroes', if it was deemed 'expedient' to do so. They set aside $10,000 to buy the property and make improvements.\"</ref><ref name=Crouch28 /> Rape sentencing laws stipulated either capital punishment, or life in prison, or a minimum sentence of five years. Even to commentators who favored the codes, this \"wide latitude in punishment\" seemed to imply a clear \"anti-Negro bias\".<ref name=Crouch30>Crouch, \"All the Vile Passions\" (1993), p. 30.</ref>\n\n===Tennessee===\nTennessee had been [[Tennessee in the American Civil War|occupied by the Union]] for a long period during the war. As [[List of governors of Tennessee|military governor of Tennessee]], Andrew Johnson declared a suspension of the slave code in September 1864. However, these laws were still enforced in lower courts.<ref>Forehand, \"Striking Resemblance\" (1996), p. 41.</ref> In 1865, Tennessee freedpeople had no legal status whatsoever, and local jurisdictions often filled the void with extremely harsh Black Codes.<ref name=Forehand61>Forehand, \"Striking Resemblance\" (1996), p. 61.</ref> During that year, Blacks went from one-fiftieth to one-third of the State's prison population.<ref name=Forehand61 />\n\nTennessee had a particularly urgent desire to re-enter the Union's good graces and end the occupation.<ref>Forehand, \"Striking Resemblance\" (1996), p. 9.</ref> When the [[Tennessee Legislature]] began to debate a Black Code, it received such negative attention in the Northern press that no comprehensive Code was ever established.<ref>Forehand, \"Striking Resemblance\" (1996), pp. 42\u201343, 54.</ref> Instead, the State legalized Black suffrage and passed a civil rights law guaranteeing Blacks equal rights in commerce and access to the Courts.<ref>Forehand, \"Striking Resemblance\" (1996), pp. 49\u201350.</ref>\n\nHowever, Tennessee society, including its judicial system, retained the same racist attitudes as did other states. Although its legal code did not discriminate against Blacks so explicitly, its law enforcement and criminal justice systems relied more heavily on racist [[enforcement discretion]] to create a ''de facto'' Black Code.<ref>Forehand, \"Striking Resemblance\" (1996), p. 13.</ref> The state already had vagrancy and apprenticeship laws which could easily be enforced in the same way as Black Codes in other states.<ref>Forehand, \"Striking Resemblance\" (1996), p. 50.</ref> Vagrancy laws came into much more frequent use after the war.<ref>Forehand, \"Striking Resemblance\" (1996), p. 57.</ref> And just as in Mississippi, Black children were often bound in apprenticeship to their former owners.<ref>Forehand, \"Striking Resemblance\" (1996), p. 51.</ref>\n\nThe legislature passed two laws on May 17, 1865; one to \"Punish all Armed Prowlers, Guerilla, [[Brigand]]s, and [[Highwayman|Highway Robbers]]\"; the other to authorize capital punishment for thefts, [[burglary]], and [[arson]]. These laws were targeted at Blacks and enforced disproportionately against Blacks, but did not discuss race explicitly.<ref>Forehand, \"Striking Resemblance\" (1996), pp. 71\u201372.</ref>\n\nTennessee law permitted Blacks to testify against Whites in 1865, but this change did not immediately take practical effect in the lower courts.<ref>Forehand, \"Striking Resemblance\" (1996), p. 39\u201340, 62.</ref> Blacks could not sit on juries.<ref>Forehand, \"Striking Resemblance\" (1996), p. 58.</ref> Still on the books were laws specifying capital punishment for a Black man who raped a White woman.<ref>Forehand, \"Striking Resemblance\" (1996), p. 56\u201357.</ref>\n\nTennessee enacted new vagrancy and enticement laws in 1875.<ref>Cohen, ''At Freedom's Edge'' (1991), p. 31.</ref><ref>Forehand, \"Striking Resemblance\" (1996), p. 53.</ref>\n\n===Kentucky===\nKentucky had established a system of [[Convict leasing|leasing prison labor]] in 1825.<ref>Forehand, \"Striking Resemblance\" (1996), p. 76.</ref> This system drew a steady supply of laborers from the decisions of \"negro courts\", informal tribunals which included slaveowners.<ref>Forehand, \"Striking Resemblance\" (1996), p. 77.</ref> Free Blacks were frequently arrested and forced into labor.<ref>Forehand, \"Striking Resemblance\" (1996), pp. 77\u201378.</ref>\n\nKentucky did not secede from the Union and therefore gained wide leeway from the federal government during Reconstruction.<ref>Forehand, \"Striking Resemblance\" (1996), p. 3.</ref> With Delaware, Kentucky did not ratify the Thirteenth Amendment and maintained legal slavery until it was nationally prohibited when the Amendment went into effect in December 1865.<ref>Forehand, \"Striking Resemblance\" (1996), p. 102.</ref> After the Thirteenth Amendment took effect, the state was obligated to rewrite its laws.<ref name=Forehand107>Forehand, \"Striking Resemblance\" (1996), p. 107.</ref>\n\nThe result was a set of Black Codes passed in early 1866. These granted a set of rights: to own property, make contracts, and some other innovations.<ref name=Forehand107 /> They also included new vagrancy and apprentice laws, which did not mention Blacks explicitly but were clearly directed toward them.<ref name=Forehand108>Forehand, \"Striking Resemblance\" (1996), p. 108.</ref> The vagrancy law covered loitering, \"rambling without a job\" and \"keeping a disorderly house\".<ref name=Forehand108 /> City jails filled up; wages dropped below pre-war rates.<ref>Forehand, \"Striking Resemblance\" (1996), pp. 112\u2013113.</ref>\n\nThe Freedmen's Bureau in Kentucky was especially weak and could not mount a significant response.<ref>Forehand, \"Striking Resemblance\" (1996), pp. 105\u2013106.</ref> The Bureau attempted to cancel a racially discriminatory apprenticeship law (which stipulated that only White children learn to read) but found itself thwarted by local authorities.<ref>Forehand, \"Striking Resemblance\" (1996), p. 117.</ref>\n\nSome legislation also created informal, ''de facto'' discrimination against Blacks. A new law against hunting on Sundays, for example, prevented Black workers from hunting on their only day off.<ref name=Forehand109>Forehand, \"Striking Resemblance\" (1996), pp. 13, 109.</ref>\n\nKentucky law prevented Blacks from [[Testimony|testifying]] against Whites, a restriction which the federal government sought to remedy by providing access to federal courts through the [[Civil Rights Act of 1866]]. Kentucky challenged the constitutionality of these courts and prevailed in ''Blyew v. United States'' (1872).<ref>Tsesis, ''The Thirteenth Amendment and American Freedom'' (2004), pp. 64\u201366.</ref> All contracts required the presence of a White witness.<ref name=Forehand109 /> Passage of the Fourteenth Amendment did not have a great effect on Kentucky's Black Codes.<ref>Forehand, \"Striking Resemblance\" (1996), p. 4.</ref>\n\n==Legacy and interventions==\nThis regime of white-dominated labor was not identified by the North as involuntary servitude until after 1900.<ref>Daniel, \"Metamorphosis of Slavery\" (1979), p. 89. \"It came as a shock, then, in 1901, when a new kind of slavery was discovered. It was called peonage after the labor practice in Mexico and through an unlikely set of circumstances violated an 1867 federal state in the United States. The law lay dormant for thirty-four years, but peonage was widespread in the South by the turn of the century, and it was especially virulent in the [[cotton belt]], the [[Mississippi Delta]], and the [[turpentine belt]].\"</ref> In 1907, [[Attorney General of the United States|Attorney General]] [[Charles Joseph Bonaparte]] issued a report, ''Peonage Matters'', which found that, beyond [[Peon|debt peonage]], there was a widespread system of laws \"considered to have been passed to force negro laborers to work\".<ref name=Cohen31 />\n\nAfter creating the [[United States Department of Justice Civil Rights Division|Civil Rights Section]] in 1939, the [[United States Department of Justice|Federal Department of Justice]] launched a wave of successful [[Thirteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Thirteenth Amendment]] prosecutions against involuntary servitude in the South.\n\nMany of the Southern vagrancy laws remained in force until the Supreme Court's ''[[Papachristou v. Jacksonville]]'' decision in 1972.<ref name=Stewart2262>Stewart, \"Black Codes and Broken Windows\" (1998), p. 2262.</ref> Although the laws were defended as preventing crime, the Court held that Jacksonville's vagrancy law \"furnishes a convenient tool for 'harsh and discriminatory enforcement by local prosecuting officials, against particular groups deemed to merit their displeasure.'\"<ref>Stewart, \"Black Codes and Broken Windows\" (1998), p. 2263.</ref>\n\nEven after ''Papachristou'', police activity in many parts of the United States discriminates against racial minority groups. Gary Stewart has identified contemporary [[gang injunction]]s\u2014which target young Black or Latino men who gather in public\u2014as a conspicuous legacy of Southern Black Codes.<ref>Stewart, \"Black Codes and Broken Windows\" (1998), pp. 2263\u20132264.</ref> Stewart argues that these laws maintain a system of white supremacy and reflect a system of racist prejudice, even though racism is rarely acknowledged explicitly in their creation and enforcement.<ref>Stewart, \"Black Codes and Broken Windows\" (1998), pp. 2268\u20132270.</ref> Contemporary Black commentators have argued that the current [[Race in the United States criminal justice system|disproportionate]] [[Incarceration in the United States|incarceration]] of African Americans, with a concomitant rise in prison labor, is comparable (perhaps unfavorably) with the historical Black Codes.<ref>Bruce A.

Vagrancy laws and peonage systems are widespread features of post-slavery societies.<ref>Daniel, \"Metamorphosis of Slavery\" (1979), p. 95.</ref> One theory suggests that particularly restrictive laws emerge in larger countries (compare Jamaica with the United States) where the ruling group does not occupy land at a high enough density to prevent the freed people from gaining their own.<ref>Daniel, \"Metamorphosis of Slavery\" (1979), pp. 93\u201394.</ref> It seems that the United States was uniquely successful in maintaining involuntary servitude after legal emancipation.<ref>Daniel, \"Metamorphosis of Slavery\" (1979), p. 94.\"Yet West Indian planters were not as successful as were southern planters in perpetuating involuntary servitude among freedmen. Despite vagrancy and contract laws in Jamaica, compulsion did not work. [\u2026] In the United States the legal machinery and violence were more successful in forcing plantation laborers to work.\"</ref>\n\nHistorians have also compared the end of the slavery in the United States to the formal [[decolonization]] of [[decolonization of Asia|Asian]] and [[decolonization of Africa|African]] nations. Like emancipation, decolonization was a landmark political change\u2014but its significance, according to some historians, was tempered by the [[neocolonialism|continuity of economic exploitation]].<ref>Emmer, \"The Price of Freedom\" (1992), p. 23. \"By breaking their colonial links, the undeveloped or underdeveloped countries in Asia and Africa were expected to be able finally to follow the path of sustained economic growth that Europe and North America had walked in the past. In reality, the act of decolonization itself did not change the economic position of the newly independent countries, and in some cases decolonization actually slowed economic growth or even reversed it, because the scarce factors of production were used in creating an army or in experimenting with a different division of land.\"</ref> The end of legal slavery in the United States did not seem to have major effects on the global economy or international relations.<ref>Emmer, \"The Price of Freedom\" (1992), pp. 26\u201328.</ref> Given the pattern of economic continuity, writes economist Pieter Emmer, \"the words ''emancipation'' and ''abolition'' must be regarded with the utmost suspicion.\"<ref>Emmer, \"The Price of Freedom\" (1992), p. 24.</ref>\n\n==See also==\n{{Div col}}\n* [[40 acres and a mule]]\n* [[Apartheid in South Africa]]\n* [[Code Noir]]\n* [[Grandfather clause]]\n* [[Judicial aspects of race in the United States]]\n* [[List of Jim Crow law examples by state]]\n* [[Oregon black exclusion laws]]\n* [[Racial segregation in the United States]]\n* [[Redlining]]\n* [[Republic of New Afrika]]\n* [[Reverse Underground Railroad]]\n* [[Wage slavery]]\n* [[History of unfree labor in the United States]]\n{{Div col end}}\n\n==Notes==\n{{notelist}}\n\n===References===\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n===Bibliography===\n* Belz, Herman.

There are 60&nbsp;known [[tropical cyclone]]s that affected the peninsula, primarily [[Yemen]] and [[Oman]]. For convenience, storms are included that affected the Yemeni island of [[Socotra]]. Most of the tropical cyclones originated in the Arabian Sea, the portion of the [[Indian Ocean]] north of the equator and west of [[India]]. The remainder formed in the [[Bay of Bengal]] off India's east coast. Collectively, the 60&nbsp;storms have caused at least [[United States dollar|US$]]8.3&nbsp;billion in damage and 1,693&nbsp;deaths. The strongest and most damaging cyclone was [[Cyclone Gonu]], which caused [[United states dollar|US$]]4&nbsp;billion in damage and 50&nbsp;fatalities when it struck Oman in 2007. Tropical cyclone damage in the Arabian Peninsula is chiefly due to flooding.\n\n==Climatology==\nWithin the [[Indian Ocean]] north of the [[equator]], [[tropical cyclone]]s are tracked by the [[India Meteorological Department]] (IMD), which is the officially designated [[Regional Specialized Meteorological Center]] for the region.<ref>{{cite web|publisher=World Meteorological Organization|title=Latest Advisories on Current Tropical Cyclones Hurricanes Typhoons|access-date=January 14, 2016|url=https://www.wmo.int/pages/prog/www/tcp/Advisories-RSMCs.html|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151206104219/http://www.wmo.int/pages/prog/www/tcp/Advisories-RSMCs.html|archive-date=December 6, 2015|url-status=live}}</ref> The American-based [[Joint Typhoon Warning Center]] (JTWC) also tracks storms in the basin on an unofficial basis.<ref>{{cite web|title=Frequently Asked Questions|publisher=Joint Typhoon Warning Center|access-date=January 14, 2016|url=http://www.usno.navy.mil/JTWC/frequently-asked-questions-1/frequently-asked-questions|date=August 14, 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131004091412/http://www.usno.navy.mil/JTWC/frequently-asked-questions-1/frequently-asked-questions/|archive-date=October 4, 2013|url-status=live}}</ref> The [[Arabian Sea]], which borders the Arabian Peninsula, typically spawns tropical cyclones in the southeastern portion of the body of water, offshore of western India.<ref name=\"mem\"/> About 48.5% of cyclones dissipate without making [[landfall (meteorology)|landfall]], or moving ashore,<ref>{{cite web|title=Landfall|publisher=India Meteorological Department|access-date=January 14, 2016|url=http://www.rsmcnewdelhi.imd.gov.in/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=54&Itemid=202&lang=en|date=February 20, 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160131073838/http://www.rsmcnewdelhi.imd.gov.in/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=54&Itemid=202&lang=en|archive-date=January 31, 2016|url-status=live}}</ref> and around one in three storms move toward the Arabian Peninsula.<ref name=\"mem\"/> However, storms do not form in the western Arabian Sea because of cool [[sea surface temperature]]s (the result of strong winds from the [[monsoon]]),<ref name=\"mem\"/><ref>{{cite web|title=Genesis|publisher=India Meteorological Department|access-date=January 14, 2016|url=http://www.rsmcnewdelhi.imd.gov.in/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=51&Itemid=199&lang=en|date=February 20, 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160131061325/http://www.rsmcnewdelhi.imd.gov.in/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=51&Itemid=199&lang=en|archive-date=January 31, 2016|url-status=live}}</ref> as well as dry air from the Arabian Peninsula.<ref name=\"rw1115\"/>\n\n==Impacts by country==\n[[File:Arabian Peninsula (orthographic projection).png|right|thumb|Map of the Arabian Peninsula (highlighted in green)|alt=The Arabian Peninsula is bounded by the Red Sea, the Arabian Sea, and the Persian Gulf]]\nThe sultanate of Oman, located on the southeastern corner of the Arabian Peninsula, regularly receives the impacts of tropical cyclones due to its long coastline along the Arabian Sea.<ref name=\"wmoman\"/> On average, storms strike Oman once every three years, mostly between [[Masirah Island]] and [[Salalah]], and usually before June or after October.<ref name=\"mem\"/><ref name=\"anal\"/> From 1943 to 1967, tropical cyclones accounted for about 25% of Salalah's overall rainfall.<ref>{{cite report|series=Global tropical/extratropical cyclone climatic atlas|title=Hurricane TC-18-77, 9\u201313 June|year=1996|work=National Climatic Data Center|access-date=January 16, 2016|url=http://webapp1.dlib.indiana.edu/virtual_disk_library/index.cgi/4274123/FID218/DATA/TROPIC/NI_NAR/1977_2.NAR|date=|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160201092305/http://webapp1.dlib.indiana.edu/virtual_disk_library/index.cgi/4274123/FID218/DATA/TROPIC/NI_NAR/1977_2.NAR|archive-date=February 1, 2016|url-status=live}}</ref> About once every five years, a storm affects the [[Dhofar Governorate|Dhofar region]] of southern Oman, and Oman's capital of [[Muscat, Oman|Muscat]] about once every ten years in.<ref name=\"anal\"/> Between 1890 and 1996, 36&nbsp;storms struck Oman, although some landfalling storms might be excluded from the historical record due to the lack of population centers.<ref name=\"mem\"/> In addition, storm intensities at landfall have only been accurately known since around 1979,<ref name=\"wmoman\"/> and reliable record keeping began around 1970.

There are 60&nbsp;known [[tropical cyclone]]s that affected the peninsula, primarily [[Yemen]] and [[Oman]]. For convenience, storms are included that affected the Yemeni island of [[Socotra]]. Most of the tropical cyclones originated in the Arabian Sea, the portion of the [[Indian Ocean]] north of the equator and west of [[India]]. The remainder formed in the [[Bay of Bengal]] off India's east coast. Collectively, the 60&nbsp;storms have caused at least [[United States dollar|US$]]8.3&nbsp;billion in damage and 1,693&nbsp;deaths. The strongest and most damaging cyclone was [[Cyclone Gonu]], which caused [[United states dollar|US$]]4&nbsp;billion in damage and 50&nbsp;fatalities when it struck Oman in 2007. Tropical cyclone damage in the Arabian Peninsula is chiefly due to flooding.\n\n==Climatology==\nWithin the [[Indian Ocean]] north of the [[equator]], [[tropical cyclone]]s are tracked by the [[India Meteorological Department]] (IMD), which is the officially designated [[Regional Specialized Meteorological Center]] for the region.<ref>{{cite web|publisher=World Meteorological Organization|title=Latest Advisories on Current Tropical Cyclones Hurricanes Typhoons|access-date=January 14, 2016|url=https://www.wmo.int/pages/prog/www/tcp/Advisories-RSMCs.html|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151206104219/http://www.wmo.int/pages/prog/www/tcp/Advisories-RSMCs.html|archive-date=December 6, 2015|url-status=live}}</ref> The American-based [[Joint Typhoon Warning Center]] (JTWC) also tracks storms in the basin on an unofficial basis.<ref>{{cite web|title=Frequently Asked Questions|publisher=Joint Typhoon Warning Center|access-date=January 14, 2016|url=http://www.usno.navy.mil/JTWC/frequently-asked-questions-1/frequently-asked-questions|date=August 14, 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131004091412/http://www.usno.navy.mil/JTWC/frequently-asked-questions-1/frequently-asked-questions/|archive-date=October 4, 2013|url-status=live}}</ref> The [[Arabian Sea]], which borders the Arabian Peninsula, typically spawns tropical cyclones in the southeastern portion of the body of water, offshore of western India.<ref name=\"mem\"/> About 48.5% of cyclones dissipate without making [[landfall (meteorology)|landfall]], or moving ashore,<ref>{{cite web|title=Landfall|publisher=India Meteorological Department|access-date=January 14, 2016|url=http://www.rsmcnewdelhi.imd.gov.in/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=54&Itemid=202&lang=en|date=February 20, 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160131073838/http://www.rsmcnewdelhi.imd.gov.in/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=54&Itemid=202&lang=en|archive-date=January 31, 2016|url-status=live}}</ref> and around one in three storms move toward the Arabian Peninsula.<ref name=\"mem\"/> However, storms do not form in the western Arabian Sea because of cool [[sea surface temperature]]s (the result of strong winds from the [[monsoon]]),<ref name=\"mem\"/><ref>{{cite web|title=Genesis|publisher=India Meteorological Department|access-date=January 14, 2016|url=http://www.rsmcnewdelhi.imd.gov.in/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=51&Itemid=199&lang=en|date=February 20, 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160131061325/http://www.rsmcnewdelhi.imd.gov.in/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=51&Itemid=199&lang=en|archive-date=January 31, 2016|url-status=live}}</ref> as well as dry air from the Arabian Peninsula.<ref name=\"rw1115\"/>\n\n==Impacts by country==\n[[File:Arabian Peninsula (orthographic projection).png|right|thumb|Map of the Arabian Peninsula (highlighted in green)|alt=The Arabian Peninsula is bounded by the Red Sea, the Arabian Sea, and the Persian Gulf]]\nThe sultanate of Oman, located on the southeastern corner of the Arabian Peninsula, regularly receives the impacts of tropical cyclones due to its long coastline along the Arabian Sea.<ref name=\"wmoman\"/> On average, storms strike Oman once every three years, mostly between [[Masirah Island]] and [[Salalah]], and usually before June or after October.<ref name=\"mem\"/><ref name=\"anal\"/> From 1943 to 1967, tropical cyclones accounted for about 25% of Salalah's overall rainfall.<ref>{{cite report|series=Global tropical/extratropical cyclone climatic atlas|title=Hurricane TC-18-77, 9\u201313 June|year=1996|work=National Climatic Data Center|access-date=January 16, 2016|url=http://webapp1.dlib.indiana.edu/virtual_disk_library/index.cgi/4274123/FID218/DATA/TROPIC/NI_NAR/1977_2.NAR|date=|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160201092305/http://webapp1.dlib.indiana.edu/virtual_disk_library/index.cgi/4274123/FID218/DATA/TROPIC/NI_NAR/1977_2.NAR|archive-date=February 1, 2016|url-status=live}}</ref> About once every five years, a storm affects the [[Dhofar Governorate|Dhofar region]] of southern Oman, and Oman's capital of [[Muscat, Oman|Muscat]] about once every ten years in.<ref name=\"anal\"/> Between 1890 and 1996, 36&nbsp;storms struck Oman, although some landfalling storms might be excluded from the historical record due to the lack of population centers.<ref name=\"mem\"/> In addition, storm intensities at landfall have only been accurately known since around 1979,<ref name=\"wmoman\"/> and reliable record keeping began around 1970.

There is also VST/ReWire support so that FL Studio can be an instrument in other hosts such as Cubase, Sonic Solutions, [[Logic Studio|Logic]], and other software. As of version 10.0 this edition includes the Simsynth Live [[synthesizer]] instrument, the DrumSynth live percussion synthesizer, the DX10FM synthesizer, and the Wasp/Wasp XT synthesizers.

FL Studio has undergone a number of major updates since its inception. On 22 May 2018, a macOS-compatible version of FL Studio was released.\n\n==Software overview==\n\n* '''FL Studio Express''' - This version allows for [[step sequencer]]-only editing and is chiefly suited for 64-step [[loop (music)|loop]] creation.<ref name=\"what\"/> Each pattern can consist of an unlimited number of instruments\u2014either samples, native, or [[Virtual Studio Technology|VST]] instruments. Instruments in the pattern can be routed to the Mixer tool for effects processing, and effects as of version 10.0 include Delay, Delay Bank, EQUOo, Flangus, Love Philter, Vocoder, Parametric EQ & EQ2, Multiband Compressor, Spectroman, Stereo Enhancer, Wave Candy, Wave Shaper, and Soundgoodizer. There is no [[piano roll]], playlist ability, automation, audio recording, or VST/[[ReWire]] client.<ref name=\"editions\">{{cite news\n| title       = Editions\n| url         = http://www.image-line.com/flstudio-feature-comparison/\n| publisher   = [[Image-Line Software]] | website = image-line.com\n| accessdate  = 2015-04-26\n}}</ref>\n* '''Fruity Edition''' \u2013 The Fruity Edition allows users to access the playlist, [[piano roll]], and event automation features, which allow for complex and lengthy arranging and sequencing. There is also VST/ReWire support so that FL Studio can be an instrument in other hosts such as Cubase, Sonic Solutions, [[Logic Studio|Logic]], and other software. As of version 10.0 this edition includes the Simsynth Live [[synthesizer]] instrument, the DrumSynth live percussion synthesizer, the DX10FM synthesizer, and the Wasp/Wasp XT synthesizers. There is no audio recording feature.<ref name=\"editions\"/> In FL Studio 12, this was given (spline-based) automation.\n* '''Producer Edition''' \u2013 The Producer Edition includes all of the features of the Fruity Edition, as well as full recording for internal and external audio and post-production tools. It allows for hand-drawing point and curve based [[spline (mathematics)|splines]] (referred to as \"Automation Clips\"). Plugins include Edison, Slicex (loop slicer and re-arranger), [[Sytrus]], Maximus, Vocodex and Synthmaker. It also allows for waveform viewing of audio clips and the ability to add cue points.<ref name=\"editions\"/>\n* '''Signature Bundle''' \u2013 This edition includes the Producer Edition as well as a series of plugins such as the Fruity Video player, DirectWave Sampler, Harmless, NewTone, Pitcher, Gross Beat and the Hardcore Guitar Effects Suite.<ref name=\"editions\"/>\n* '''All Plugins Bundle''' \u2013 The All Plugins Bundle includes the Signature Bundle along with extra plugins, particularly synthesizers.\n* '''Free Demo''' \u2013 The free demo version includes all of the program's features, all plugins, and allows users to render project audio to [[WAV]], [[MIDI]], [[MP3]], and [[Ogg|OGG]].<ref name=\"what\" /> However, there are several drawbacks to this limitation as projects saved in demo mode will only open fully once FL Studio and plugins have been registered. Also, instrument presets cannot be saved and the audio output of some instruments will cut out momentarily every few minutes until the program and its plugins have been registered.<ref name=\"FL Studio 12.5 BETA 3\" />\n* '''Mobile''' \u2013 On June 21, 2011, Image-Line released [[FL Studio Mobile]] for iOS and in April 2013 for Android. Both support the ability to create multi-track projects on mobile devices including [[iPod Touch]]es, [[iPhone]]s, [[iPad]]s.,<ref name=\"mobile\"/> Android 2.3.3 and higher Smart Phones and Tablets.\n* '''Groove''' \u2013 On September 2, 2013, A new standalone app for Windows 8 was released.
