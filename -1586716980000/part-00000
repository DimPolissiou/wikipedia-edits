Within hours, the foal is up on its legs and keeping up with its mother. At around five-days-old, the foal is already nibbling grass. By the time its two-weeks old, the foal is grazing regularly, however, still depending on its mother's milk for fluids. The foal is weaned by 12 to 14 months, but still stays close to its mother, only leaving to play or feed with the other foals in the herd.\n\n==Behavior==\nDue to the limited resources found in their habitat, Somali wild donkeys live in a fission-fusion society. Most adults live alone, but sometimes form small herds consisting of females and their young. In areas that have more resources, or have more rain, they will sometimes fuse together to form larger temporary herds.\nStallions can maintain territories as large as nine square miles. They frequently leave dung piles as markers to remind them of their territory's boundaries. While females are welcome in their territories, stallions will often fight other males who try to mate with females in their territories. However, stallions have been observed allowing males into their territories for grazing, as long as they show no interest in his harem. <ref name=\"auto\">{{cite web|url=http://zoonooz.sandiegozoo.org/zoonooz/somali-wild-ass/|title=Somali Wild Ass|first=Wendy|last=Perkins|date=5 June 2017|website=ZOONOOZ}}</ref>\n\n==Captivity==\n\n===Global population===\n{{As of|2011}}, there are about 200 individuals in captivity around the globe<ref name=\"Somali\"/> living in 34 [[zoo]]s, as well as three animals (as of 2009) in the [[Yotvata Hai-Bar Nature Reserve]] in [[Israel]], to the north of [[Eilat]].<ref name=\"Stamm\">{{cite web| url=http://www.wst-foundation.ch/wcms/wsts.cfm/h,29/s,22/c,0/sc,de/blue.htm| title=Somali-Wildesel ''(Equus africanus somalicus)''| work=F\u00f6rderprojekte der Werner Stamm Stiftung| publisher=Werner Stamm Stiftung| accessdate=2011-11-14|language=de}}</ref>  The international [[studbook]] is managed by [[Tierpark Berlin]].<ref name=\"Direktoren\">{{cite web| url=http://www.zoodirektoren.de/index.php?option=com_k2&view=item&id=179:somali-wildesel-equus-africanus-somalicus&Itemid=255| title=Somali-Wildesel| publisher=[[Verband Deutscher Zoodirektoren]]| accessdate=22 May 2014|language=de}}</ref>\n\n===Zoo Basel===\n[[File:ZolliWildAss.JPG|thumb|Somali Wild Ass at [[Zoo Basel]]]]\nThe leading zoo for breeding this rare donkey is [[Zoo Basel]], Switzerland.

It tells the story of a middle-aged pop star, Solomon Capri, who is semi-retired but is approached to take part in the reality show ''[[Popstar to Operastar]]'' which he sees as a way to rejuvenate his career and his waning marriage. The story was inspired by Orzabal's own experience as he was approached by the ITV show himself, though did not take part.<ref>{{cite web|title=Tears For Fears' Roland Orzabal Turns Author with the Release of Sex, Drugs & Opera|url=http://www.contactmusic.com/press/tears-for-fears-roland-orzabal-turns-author-with-the-release-of-sex-drugs|publisher=Contact Music|accessdate=8 March 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|last=Orzabal|first=Roland|title=Sex, Drugs & Opera: There's Life After Rock 'n' Roll|date=2014|publisher=Crucial 7th Publishing|location=London|isbn=978-1909122710}}</ref>\n\n==Personal life==\nIn 1985, Orzabal gained considerable press attention for his strained relationship with his father and a humorous cartoon was printed in the UK tabloid ''[[The Sun (United Kingdom)|The Sun]]'' pertaining to this.

The founding principal was Prof. [[P. S. Manisundaram|P.S. Manisundaram]], a pioneering educationist in India. He was a graduate of [[Loyola College, Chennai|Loyola College]], [[Chennai]] and the [[Technical University of Nova Scotia]] (now known as [[Faculty of Engineering, Dalhousie University|Faculty of Engineering]], [[Dalhousie University]]), [[Canada]]; he pioneered the formation of Computer Science as a separate educational stream on the Indian scene. He served as the Principal of REC Tiruchirappalli from its formation in 1964 to 1982.<ref name=\"The Times of India\">{{Cite news|url=http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/trichy/NIT-T-pays-tribute-to-its-founder-P-S-Mani/articleshow/24903606.cms|title=NIT-T pays tribute to its founder P S Mani - Times of India|work=The Times of India|access-date=2017-04-09}}</ref>\n\nIn the early 1980s, the State Government began to find the logistics of controlling these colleges from Madras to be tedious and split the aegis into the [[Bharathidasan University|Bharathidasan]] and [[Bharathiar University|Bharathiyar]] universities for the [[Tiruchirappalli]] and [[Coimbatore]] areas, respectively. In 1982, the college was thus incorporated under the [[Bharathidasan University]] umbrella, of which Dr. [[P. S. Manisundaram|P.S. Manisundaram]] served as the inaugural Vice-Chancellor. The Institute would grant degrees under this name for the next 20 years, except for a brief stint under [[Anna University]] in 2001 and 2002. The college continued its progress under [[Bharathidasan University]] and introduced a Computer Science Department around 1984, split off the Mechanical Engineering Department's manufacturing stream into a Production Engineering Department and introduced the Instrumentation and Control Engineering Department in 1992.\n\nIn 2001, [[Anna University]] was granted authority over REC Trichy. This was temporary, however, as the 40-year collaboration between the Center and the State Governments for all the RECs finally dissolved; the Center upgraded all the RECs to [[National Institutes of Technology]] (NIT) and completely took control of them under the [[Ministry of Human Resource Development]].

The founding principal was Prof. [[P. S. Manisundaram|P.S. Manisundaram]], a pioneering educationist in India. He was a graduate of [[Loyola College, Chennai|Loyola College]], [[Chennai]] and the [[Technical University of Nova Scotia]] (now known as [[Faculty of Engineering, Dalhousie University|Faculty of Engineering]], [[Dalhousie University]]), [[Canada]]; he pioneered the formation of Computer Science as a separate educational stream on the Indian scene. He served as the Principal of REC Tiruchirappalli from its formation in 1964 to 1982.<ref name=\"The Times of India\">{{Cite news|url=http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/trichy/NIT-T-pays-tribute-to-its-founder-P-S-Mani/articleshow/24903606.cms|title=NIT-T pays tribute to its founder P S Mani - Times of India|work=The Times of India|access-date=2017-04-09}}</ref>\n\nIn the early 1980s, the State Government began to find the logistics of controlling these colleges from Madras to be tedious and split the aegis into the [[Bharathidasan University|Bharathidasan]] and [[Bharathiar University|Bharathiyar]] universities for the [[Tiruchirappalli]] and [[Coimbatore]] areas, respectively. In 1982, the college was thus incorporated under the [[Bharathidasan University]] umbrella, of which Dr. [[P. S. Manisundaram|P.S. Manisundaram]] served as the inaugural Vice-Chancellor. The Institute would grant degrees under this name for the next 20 years, except for a brief stint under [[Anna University]] in 2001 and 2002. The college continued its progress under [[Bharathidasan University]] and introduced a Computer Science Department around 1984, split off the Mechanical Engineering Department's manufacturing stream into a Production Engineering Department and introduced the Instrumentation and Control Engineering Department in 1992.\n\nIn 2001, [[Anna University]] was granted authority over REC Trichy. This was temporary, however, as the 40-year collaboration between the Center and the State Governments for all the RECs finally dissolved; the Center upgraded all the RECs to [[National Institutes of Technology]] (NIT) and completely took control of them under the [[Ministry of Human Resource Development]]. In 2002, former Minister of Human Resource Development [[Murli Manohar Joshi|Murali Manoher Joshi]] decided to upgrade the RECs to NITs with the goal of modelling each institute based on the [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]], but with roots in Indian culture.<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite web|url=http://www.nitt.edu/home/about/|title=NIT Trichy - About|website=www.nitt.edu|language=en|access-date=2017-02-21}}</ref><ref name=\"mhrd.gov.in\">{{Cite web|url=http://mhrd.gov.in/technical-education-5|title=Technical Education {{!}} Government of India, Ministry of Human Resource Development|website=mhrd.gov.in|language=en|access-date=2017-03-21}}</ref> In 2003, the institution was granted [[Deemed University]] status with the approval of the [[University Grants Commission (India)|University Grants Commission]] / [[All India Council for Technical Education]]; it was renamed the National Institute of Technology Tiruchirappalli and was finally granting degrees under its own name.

The team was founded in 1997 and is one of the eight original franchises of the league. The team is owned by [[Joe Tsai]], the majority owner of the [[Brooklyn Nets]]. The team's home games are played at [[Barclays Center]] in [[Brooklyn|Brooklyn, New York]].\n\nThe Liberty have qualified for the [[WNBA Playoffs]] in fourteen of its twenty-three years. The franchise has been home to many well-known players such as [[Teresa Weatherspoon]], [[Becky Hammon]], [[Leilani Mitchell]], [[Essence Carson]], and [[Cappie Pondexter]]. Through the 2016 season, the Liberty have four conference championships and have played in the [[WNBA Finals]] four times, falling to the [[Houston Comets]] in [[1997 WNBA Finals|1997]], [[1999 WNBA Finals|1999]], and [[2000 WNBA Finals|2000]], and losing to the [[Los Angeles Sparks]] in [[2002 WNBA Finals|2002]]. They have the most appearances in the WNBA Finals without a championship.\n\n==Franchise history==\n\n===Early success (1997\u20132002)===\nPrior to the team's first season, to avoid potential trademark infringement, the team purchased the trademarks of the defunct Liberty Basketball Association.\n\nWhen the WNBA opened in 1997, the Liberty were one of the first teams to choose a player, and they signed college superstar [[Rebecca Lobo]] ([[UConn Huskies women's basketball|UConn]]) to a contract. Lobo was a starter for two seasons but was injured in 1999, and her injuries eventually led to her retirement several seasons later. [[Point guard]] [[Teresa Weatherspoon]] emerged as a star and the Liberty made it to the 1997 championship game, where the team lost to the [[Houston Comets]]. In 1999, they added [[Crystal Robinson]] with the 6th overall pick<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.wnba.com/playerfile/crystal_robinson/bio.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-01-29 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140201232049/http://www.wnba.com/playerfile/crystal_robinson/bio.html |archivedate=2014-02-01 }}</ref> and returned to the WNBA Finals, where they again faced the Comets. In Game 2, Teresa Weatherspoon's halfcourt shot at the buzzer gave the Liberty a one-point road win that tied the series at a game apiece. However, the Liberty lost the third game of the series and the Comets became champions for a third straight time.\n\nIn 2000, the Liberty traded for [[Tari Phillips]] who blossomed in New York and made four straight All-Star teams. In 2001, Weatherspoon became the WNBA's all-time assist leader. Teamed with Robinson, Phillips and an emerging [[Sue Wicks]], who was once a back-up to Lobo at forward but made the 2000 All-Star game, Weatherspoon and the Liberty subsequently returned to the finals in 2000 and 2002, but lost once again to the Comets and to the [[Los Angeles Sparks]], respectively. The Liberty also advanced to the WNBA Eastern Conference Finals in 2001.\n\n===Transition seasons (2003\u20132009)===\n[[File:Madison Square Garden Liberty.jpg|250px|thumb|right|Madison Square Garden during a Liberty game.]]\n2003 marked a transition for the Liberty and with team leader Teresa Weatherspoon's WNBA career winding down, fan favorite [[Becky Hammon]] emerged as a star player. The 2004 season saw Hammon replacing Weatherspoon as the team's starting point guard.\n\nThe Liberty played six of their home games during the 2004 season at [[Radio City Music Hall]] as Madison Square Garden was hosting the [[2004 Republican National Convention]].<ref>{{cite news |title=PRO BASKETBALL; Liberty Opens Big on Its Home, Er, Stage|author=Lena Williams |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2004/07/25/sports/pro-basketball-liberty-opens-big-on-its-home-er-stage.html|newspaper=New York Times|date=25 July 2004 |accessdate=10 November 2011}}</ref> These games marked the first time Radio City had hosted a professional sporting event since the Roy Jones Jr. boxing match held in 1999.\n\nWith team leader [[Tari Phillips]] being signed away to the Houston Comets, [[Ann Wauters]] emerged as a force at the team's starting center position in 2005. However, she was unfortunately injured midway through the season. The loss of Wauters was felt as the team was swept two games to none by the [[Indiana Fever]] in the first round of the playoffs.\n\nThe Liberty had a poor 2006 season, winning only 11 games, the fewest in franchise history.\n\nAt the beginning of the 2007 WNBA season, the team traded [[Becky Hammon]] to the [[San Antonio Stars|San Antonio Silver Stars]] for [[Jessica Davenport]], a first round pick in the [[2007 WNBA Draft]]. They also acquired center [[Janel McCarville]] through the dispersal draft associated with the dissolution of the [[Charlotte Sting]]. The 2007 Liberty started out 5\u20130, then lost 7 straight games, then rallied at the end of the season to get the last playoff spot by winning 3 out of their last 4 games, beating the [[Washington Mystics]] on the tiebreaker of head-to-head record. In the Eastern Conference semifinals, the Liberty, as huge underdogs, faced the defending champion [[Detroit Shock]] in a best-of-three series. The Liberty defeated the Shock by winning Game 1 in New York. In Games 2 and 3 the Liberty lost both games to the Shock in Detroit, 76\u201373 and 71\u201370 (OT) respectively.\n\nIn 2008, the Liberty drafted former [[Rutgers Scarlet Knights women's basketball|Rutgers]] shooting guard [[Essence Carson]] and former [[North Carolina Tar Heels women's basketball|North Carolina]] forward Erlana Larkins, and signed former [[Utah Utes women's basketball|Utah]] point guard [[Leilani Mitchell]] during the preseason. Despite having the youngest average age of any WNBA team, the Liberty managed to win 19 regular season games in 2008, to defeat the [[Connecticut Sun]] in the first round of playoff action, and to come within two points of defeating the [[Detroit Shock]] in the third and last game of the Eastern Conference Finals. Again, the Detroit series entailed a Liberty victory at home in Game 1, followed by narrow defeats away in Games 2 and 3. The 2008 season also featured the \"[[Liberty Outdoor Classic]]\", the first ever professional regular season [[basketball]] game to be played outdoors, on July 19 at [[Arthur Ashe Stadium]] of the [[USTA Billie Jean King National Tennis Center]]. The [[Indiana Fever]] defeated the Liberty in the Outdoor Classic.\n\nIn the [[2009 WNBA Draft]], the Liberty selected local favorite [[Kia Vaughn]] from Rutgers. With a solid core group, the Liberty looked to be a contender in the East yet again.\n\nIn the 2009 season, however, they never proved to be a contender and the team fired head coach [[Pat Coyle (basketball)|Pat Coyle]]. To replace Coyle, the Liberty hired then-Liberty assistant coach [[Anne Donovan]] on an interim basis. Despite the coaching change, the franchise continued to struggle, finishing 13\u201321, their second worst record in franchise history.\n\n===The Cappie Pondexter era (2010\u20132014)===\nThe New York Liberty fared better in 2010, during Donovan's first and only full season as head coach. Led by newly signed high scorer [[Cappie Pondexter]] (formerly of the [[Phoenix Mercury]]) and the 2010 [[WNBA Most Improved Player Award|Most Improved Player Award]] winner Leilani Mitchell, the team made it all the way to the [[2010 WNBA Playoffs#Conference Finals|Eastern Conference Finals]], where they lost to the Atlanta Dream.\n\nThe team had high hopes for 2011, after the hiring of former [[2005 WNBA Finals|WNBA champion]] head coach [[John Whisenant]]. [[Janel McCarville]] did not report to training camp, seeking time with her family, and as such, was suspended for the duration of the 2011 season. This caused division and discord within the New York Liberty fanbase. [[Kia Vaughn]] was unexpectedly thrust into the role of starting Center.\n\nThe Liberty were originally scheduled to be displaced from their usual home court due to renovations at [[Madison Square Garden]] scheduled to begin in 2009. However, the renovation plans were delayed, and the Liberty played at the Garden in 2009 and 2010. The Liberty ended up playing in the [[Prudential Center]] in [[Newark, New Jersey|Newark]], [[New Jersey]] for their 2011, 2012, and 2013 seasons while the renovations were ongoing.\n\nPondexter and [[Plenette Pierson]], along with improved play from Vaughn, allowed New York to be competitive early in the 2011 season. The team went into the [[2011 WNBA All-Star Game|All-Star break]] in third place in the Eastern Conference. In August, [[Sidney Spencer]] was traded to the [[Phoenix Mercury]] in exchange for [[Kara Braxton]]. By maintaining a fairly even standard of play, the Liberty made their way into the WNBA Playoffs. However, the Liberty fell to the [[Indiana Fever]] in the Eastern Conference Semifinals.\n\n===Isiah Thomas takes over (2015\u20132018)===\nOn May 5, 2015, the Liberty hired Thomas as Team President overseeing all business and basketball operations of the franchise.<ref>{{cite web|title=Liberty introduce Team President Isiah Thomas|url=http://liberty.wnba.com/news/liberty-introduce-team-president-isiah-thomas/|website=New York Liberty}}</ref> Under Thomas' leadership as team president and the coaching staff led by [[Bill Laimbeer]] as head coach, the Liberty finished first in the Eastern Conference during the 2015 season.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Berman|first1=Marc|title=Isiah Thomas \u2013 yes, that Isiah Thomas \u2013 is Liberty's Mr. Fix-t|url=https://nypost.com/2015/08/01/isiah-thomas-yes-that-isiah-thomas-is-libertys-mr-fix-it/|website=New York Post}}</ref>\n\nOn August 2, 2015, during halftime at the game against the [[Seattle Storm]], the New York Liberty inducted WNBA legend [[Becky Hammon]] into the Liberty's Ring of Honor. Thomas presented Hammon with her ring during the induction ceremony at [[Madison Square Garden]]. Hammon, a former New York Liberty point guard, is currently an [[National Basketball Association|NBA]] assistant coach for the [[San Antonio Spurs]].<ref>{{cite web|last1=Bacharach|first1=Erik|title=Becky Hammon inducted into Liberty's Ring of Honor|url=http://www.newsday.com/sports/basketball/liberty/becky-hammon-inducted-into-liberty-s-ring-of-honor-1.10700903|website=Newsday}}</ref>\n\nAfter qualifying for the [[2016 WNBA Playoffs]], the Liberty lost to the [[Phoenix Mercury]] in the second round.<ref>{{cite news|title=New York Liberty get eliminated by Phoenix Mercury|url=http://www.wnba.com/game/20160924phonyl/|last=|first=|date=24 September 2016 |accessdate=1 October 2016}}</ref>\n\nIn November 2017, the Madison Square Garden Company and [[James L.

The team was founded in 1997 and is one of the eight original franchises of the league. The team is owned by [[Joe Tsai]], the majority owner of the [[Brooklyn Nets]]. The team's home games are played at [[Barclays Center]] in [[Brooklyn|Brooklyn, New York]].\n\nThe Liberty have qualified for the [[WNBA Playoffs]] in fourteen of its twenty-three years. The franchise has been home to many well-known players such as [[Teresa Weatherspoon]], [[Becky Hammon]], [[Leilani Mitchell]], [[Essence Carson]], and [[Cappie Pondexter]]. Through the 2016 season, the Liberty have four conference championships and have played in the [[WNBA Finals]] four times, falling to the [[Houston Comets]] in [[1997 WNBA Finals|1997]], [[1999 WNBA Finals|1999]], and [[2000 WNBA Finals|2000]], and losing to the [[Los Angeles Sparks]] in [[2002 WNBA Finals|2002]]. They have the most appearances in the WNBA Finals without a championship.\n\n==Franchise history==\n\n===Early success (1997\u20132002)===\nPrior to the team's first season, to avoid potential trademark infringement, the team purchased the trademarks of the defunct Liberty Basketball Association.\n\nWhen the WNBA opened in 1997, the Liberty were one of the first teams to choose a player, and they signed college superstar [[Rebecca Lobo]] ([[UConn Huskies women's basketball|UConn]]) to a contract. Lobo was a starter for two seasons but was injured in 1999, and her injuries eventually led to her retirement several seasons later. [[Point guard]] [[Teresa Weatherspoon]] emerged as a star and the Liberty made it to the 1997 championship game, where the team lost to the [[Houston Comets]]. In 1999, they added [[Crystal Robinson]] with the 6th overall pick<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.wnba.com/playerfile/crystal_robinson/bio.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-01-29 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140201232049/http://www.wnba.com/playerfile/crystal_robinson/bio.html |archivedate=2014-02-01 }}</ref> and returned to the WNBA Finals, where they again faced the Comets. In Game 2, Teresa Weatherspoon's halfcourt shot at the buzzer gave the Liberty a one-point road win that tied the series at a game apiece. However, the Liberty lost the third game of the series and the Comets became champions for a third straight time.\n\nIn 2000, the Liberty traded for [[Tari Phillips]] who blossomed in New York and made four straight All-Star teams. In 2001, Weatherspoon became the WNBA's all-time assist leader. Teamed with Robinson, Phillips and an emerging [[Sue Wicks]], who was once a back-up to Lobo at forward but made the 2000 All-Star game, Weatherspoon and the Liberty subsequently returned to the finals in 2000 and 2002, but lost once again to the Comets and to the [[Los Angeles Sparks]], respectively. The Liberty also advanced to the WNBA Eastern Conference Finals in 2001.\n\n===Transition seasons (2003\u20132009)===\n[[File:Madison Square Garden Liberty.jpg|250px|thumb|right|Madison Square Garden during a Liberty game.]]\n2003 marked a transition for the Liberty and with team leader Teresa Weatherspoon's WNBA career winding down, fan favorite [[Becky Hammon]] emerged as a star player. The 2004 season saw Hammon replacing Weatherspoon as the team's starting point guard.\n\nThe Liberty played six of their home games during the 2004 season at [[Radio City Music Hall]] as Madison Square Garden was hosting the [[2004 Republican National Convention]].<ref>{{cite news |title=PRO BASKETBALL; Liberty Opens Big on Its Home, Er, Stage|author=Lena Williams |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2004/07/25/sports/pro-basketball-liberty-opens-big-on-its-home-er-stage.html|newspaper=New York Times|date=25 July 2004 |accessdate=10 November 2011}}</ref> These games marked the first time Radio City had hosted a professional sporting event since the Roy Jones Jr. boxing match held in 1999.\n\nWith team leader [[Tari Phillips]] being signed away to the Houston Comets, [[Ann Wauters]] emerged as a force at the team's starting center position in 2005. However, she was unfortunately injured midway through the season. The loss of Wauters was felt as the team was swept two games to none by the [[Indiana Fever]] in the first round of the playoffs.\n\nThe Liberty had a poor 2006 season, winning only 11 games, the fewest in franchise history.\n\nAt the beginning of the 2007 WNBA season, the team traded [[Becky Hammon]] to the [[San Antonio Stars|San Antonio Silver Stars]] for [[Jessica Davenport]], a first round pick in the [[2007 WNBA Draft]]. They also acquired center [[Janel McCarville]] through the dispersal draft associated with the dissolution of the [[Charlotte Sting]]. The 2007 Liberty started out 5\u20130, then lost 7 straight games, then rallied at the end of the season to get the last playoff spot by winning 3 out of their last 4 games, beating the [[Washington Mystics]] on the tiebreaker of head-to-head record. In the Eastern Conference semifinals, the Liberty, as huge underdogs, faced the defending champion [[Detroit Shock]] in a best-of-three series. The Liberty defeated the Shock by winning Game 1 in New York. In Games 2 and 3 the Liberty lost both games to the Shock in Detroit, 76\u201373 and 71\u201370 (OT) respectively.\n\nIn 2008, the Liberty drafted former [[Rutgers Scarlet Knights women's basketball|Rutgers]] shooting guard [[Essence Carson]] and former [[North Carolina Tar Heels women's basketball|North Carolina]] forward Erlana Larkins, and signed former [[Utah Utes women's basketball|Utah]] point guard [[Leilani Mitchell]] during the preseason. Despite having the youngest average age of any WNBA team, the Liberty managed to win 19 regular season games in 2008, to defeat the [[Connecticut Sun]] in the first round of playoff action, and to come within two points of defeating the [[Detroit Shock]] in the third and last game of the Eastern Conference Finals. Again, the Detroit series entailed a Liberty victory at home in Game 1, followed by narrow defeats away in Games 2 and 3. The 2008 season also featured the \"[[Liberty Outdoor Classic]]\", the first ever professional regular season [[basketball]] game to be played outdoors, on July 19 at [[Arthur Ashe Stadium]] of the [[USTA Billie Jean King National Tennis Center]]. The [[Indiana Fever]] defeated the Liberty in the Outdoor Classic.\n\nIn the [[2009 WNBA Draft]], the Liberty selected local favorite [[Kia Vaughn]] from Rutgers. With a solid core group, the Liberty looked to be a contender in the East yet again.\n\nIn the 2009 season, however, they never proved to be a contender and the team fired head coach [[Pat Coyle (basketball)|Pat Coyle]]. To replace Coyle, the Liberty hired then-Liberty assistant coach [[Anne Donovan]] on an interim basis. Despite the coaching change, the franchise continued to struggle, finishing 13\u201321, their second worst record in franchise history.\n\n===The Cappie Pondexter era (2010\u20132014)===\nThe New York Liberty fared better in 2010, during Donovan's first and only full season as head coach. Led by newly signed high scorer [[Cappie Pondexter]] (formerly of the [[Phoenix Mercury]]) and the 2010 [[WNBA Most Improved Player Award|Most Improved Player Award]] winner Leilani Mitchell, the team made it all the way to the [[2010 WNBA Playoffs#Conference Finals|Eastern Conference Finals]], where they lost to the Atlanta Dream.\n\nThe team had high hopes for 2011, after the hiring of former [[2005 WNBA Finals|WNBA champion]] head coach [[John Whisenant]]. [[Janel McCarville]] did not report to training camp, seeking time with her family, and as such, was suspended for the duration of the 2011 season. This caused division and discord within the New York Liberty fanbase. [[Kia Vaughn]] was unexpectedly thrust into the role of starting Center.\n\nThe Liberty were originally scheduled to be displaced from their usual home court due to renovations at [[Madison Square Garden]] scheduled to begin in 2009. However, the renovation plans were delayed, and the Liberty played at the Garden in 2009 and 2010. The Liberty ended up playing in the [[Prudential Center]] in [[Newark, New Jersey|Newark]], [[New Jersey]] for their 2011, 2012, and 2013 seasons while the renovations were ongoing.\n\nPondexter and [[Plenette Pierson]], along with improved play from Vaughn, allowed New York to be competitive early in the 2011 season. The team went into the [[2011 WNBA All-Star Game|All-Star break]] in third place in the Eastern Conference. In August, [[Sidney Spencer]] was traded to the [[Phoenix Mercury]] in exchange for [[Kara Braxton]]. By maintaining a fairly even standard of play, the Liberty made their way into the WNBA Playoffs. However, the Liberty fell to the [[Indiana Fever]] in the Eastern Conference Semifinals.\n\n===Isiah Thomas takes over (2015\u20132018)===\nOn May 5, 2015, the Liberty hired Thomas as Team President overseeing all business and basketball operations of the franchise.<ref>{{cite web|title=Liberty introduce Team President Isiah Thomas|url=http://liberty.wnba.com/news/liberty-introduce-team-president-isiah-thomas/|website=New York Liberty}}</ref> Under Thomas' leadership as team president and the coaching staff led by [[Bill Laimbeer]] as head coach, the Liberty finished first in the Eastern Conference during the 2015 season.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Berman|first1=Marc|title=Isiah Thomas \u2013 yes, that Isiah Thomas \u2013 is Liberty's Mr. Fix-t|url=https://nypost.com/2015/08/01/isiah-thomas-yes-that-isiah-thomas-is-libertys-mr-fix-it/|website=New York Post}}</ref>\n\nOn August 2, 2015, during halftime at the game against the [[Seattle Storm]], the New York Liberty inducted WNBA legend [[Becky Hammon]] into the Liberty's Ring of Honor. Thomas presented Hammon with her ring during the induction ceremony at [[Madison Square Garden]]. Hammon, a former New York Liberty point guard, is currently an [[National Basketball Association|NBA]] assistant coach for the [[San Antonio Spurs]].<ref>{{cite web|last1=Bacharach|first1=Erik|title=Becky Hammon inducted into Liberty's Ring of Honor|url=http://www.newsday.com/sports/basketball/liberty/becky-hammon-inducted-into-liberty-s-ring-of-honor-1.10700903|website=Newsday}}</ref>\n\nAfter qualifying for the [[2016 WNBA Playoffs]], the Liberty lost to the [[Phoenix Mercury]] in the second round.<ref>{{cite news|title=New York Liberty get eliminated by Phoenix Mercury|url=http://www.wnba.com/game/20160924phonyl/|last=|first=|date=24 September 2016 |accessdate=1 October 2016}}</ref>\n\nIn November 2017, the Madison Square Garden Company and [[James L.

The Filiki Eteria planned to launch revolts in the [[Peloponnese]], the [[Danubian Principalities]], and [[Constantinople]] itself. The insurrection was planned for 25 March 1821 (on the Julian Calendar), the Orthodox Christian [[Feast of the Annunciation]]. However, the plans of Filiki Eteria were discovered by the Ottoman authorities, forcing the revolution to start earlier. The first revolt began on 6 March/21 February 1821 in the [[Danubian Principalities]], but it was soon put down by the Ottomans. The events in the north urged the Greeks in the Peloponnese ([[Morea]]) into action and on 17 March 1821, the [[Maniots]] were first to declare war. In September 1821, the Greeks under the leadership of [[Theodoros Kolokotronis]] captured [[Tripoli, Greece|Tripolitsa]]. Revolts in [[Crete]], [[Macedonia (Greece)|Macedonia]], and [[Central Greece]] broke out, but were eventually suppressed. Meanwhile, makeshift Greek fleets achieved success against the [[Ottoman Navy|Ottoman navy]] in the [[Aegean Sea]] and prevented Ottoman reinforcements from arriving by sea.\n\nTensions soon developed among different Greek factions, leading to two consecutive civil wars. The [[Ottoman Sultan]] called in his vassal [[Muhammad Ali of Egypt]], who agreed to send his son [[Ibrahim Pasha of Egypt|Ibrahim Pasha]] to Greece with an army to suppress the revolt in return for territorial gains. Ibrahim landed in the Peloponnese in February 1825 and brought most of the peninsula under Egyptian control by the end of that year. The town of [[Missolonghi]] fell in April 1826 after a [[Third Siege of Missolonghi|year-long siege]] by the Turks. Despite a [[Ottoman\u2013Egyptian invasion of Mani|failed invasion of Mani]], Athens also fell and the revolution looked all but lost.\n\nAt that point, the three Great Powers\u2014Russia, Britain and France\u2014decided to intervene, sending their naval squadrons to Greece in 1827. Following news that the combined Ottoman\u2013Egyptian fleet was going to attack the island of [[Hydra, Saronic Islands|Hydra]], the allied European fleets intercepted the Ottoman navy at [[Pylos|Navarino]]. After a tense week-long standoff, the [[Battle of Navarino]] led to the destruction of the Ottoman\u2013Egyptian fleet and turned the tide in favor of the revolutionaries. In 1828 the Egyptian army withdrew under pressure of a [[Morea expedition|French expeditionary force]]. The Ottoman garrisons in the Peloponnese surrendered, and the Greek revolutionaries proceeded to retake central Greece. Russia invaded the Ottoman Empire and forced it to accept Greek autonomy in the [[Treaty of Adrianople (1829)]]. After nine years of war, Greece was finally recognized as an independent state under the [[London Protocol (1830)|London Protocol]] of February 1830. Further negotiations in 1832 led to the [[London Conference of 1832|London Conference]] and the [[Treaty of Constantinople (1832)|Treaty of Constantinople]]; these defined the final borders of the new state and established [[Otto of Greece|Prince Otto]] of Bavaria as the first king of Greece.\n\n==Background==\n{{Details|Background of the Greek War of Independence}}\n\n===Ottoman rule===\n{{See also|Ottoman Greece}}\nThe [[Fall of Constantinople]] on 29&nbsp;May 1453 and the subsequent fall of the successor states of the [[Byzantine Empire]] marked the end of Byzantine sovereignty.

[[Peter the Great]] had envisaged a disintegration of the Ottoman Empire and the re-institution of a new Byzantine Empire with an Orthodox emperor. His [[Pruth River Campaign]] of 1711 set a precedent for the Greeks, when Peter appealed to Orthodox Christians to join the Russians and rise against the Turks to fight for \"''faith and homeland''\".  The Russo-Turkish wars of Catherine II (1762-1796) made the Greeks  consider their emancipation with the aid of Russia. An independence movement in Peloponnesus (Morea) was incited by Russian agents in 1769, and a Greek flotilla under Lambros Katsonis assisted the Russian fleet in the war of 1788\u20131792.<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=YwbHCQAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_ge_summary_r&cad=0#v=onepage&q&f=false Lucien J.

Korais' primary intellectual inspiration was from the Enlightenment, and he borrowed ideas from Thomas Hobbes, John Locke and Jean-Jacques Rousseau. When Korais was a young adult he moved to Paris to continue his studies. He eventually graduated from the Montpellier School of Medicine and spent the remainder of his life in Paris. He would often have political and philosophical debates with Thomas Jefferson. While in Paris he was a witness to the French Revolution and saw the democracy that came out of it. He spent a lot of his time convincing wealthy Greeks to build schools and libraries to further the education of Greeks. He believed that a furthering in education would be necessary for the general welfare and prosperity of the people of Greece, as well as the country. Korais' ultimate goal was a democratic Greece much like the Golden Age of Pericles but he died before the end of the revolution.\n\nThe connection of the Greek Revolution with the Enlightenment and the French Revolution has been questioned by several Greek authors, who considered this theory mechanistic and false.<ref>[http://antifono.gr/portal/%CE%BA%CE%B1%CF%84%CE%B7%CE%B3%CE%BF%CF%81%CE%AF%CE%B5%CF%82/%CE%B5%CE%BB%CE%BB%CE%AC%CE%B4%CE%B1-%CE%B9%CF%83%CF%84%CE%BF%CF%81%CE%AF%CE%B1-%CE%B3%CE%B5%CF%89%CF%80%CE%BF%CE%BB%CE%B9%CF%84%CE%B9%CE%BA%CE%AE/%CE%B3%CF%81%CE%B1%CF%80%CF%84%CF%8C%CF%82-%CE%BB%CF%8C%CE%B3%CE%BF%CF%82/4775-%CF%84%CE%B1-%CF%83%CF%87%CE%AE%CE%BC%CE%B1%CF%84%CE%B1-%CE%B5%CF%81%CE%BC%CE%B7%CE%BD%CE%B5%CE%B9%CF%8E%CE%BD-%CE%B3%CE%B9%CE%B1-%CF%84%CE%BF-21-%CF%84%CE%BF-%CE%BB%CE%AC%CE%B8%CE%BF%CF%82-%CF%84%CE%BF%CF%85-%CE%B4%CE%B7%CE%BC%CE%B1%CF%81%CE%AC.html Diamantis Apostolos, \"Schemes for the explanation of 21\". 24 March 2014, antifono.gr, in greek language.

Most of the members of the Peloponnesian Senate were local notables (lay and ecclesiastical) or persons controlled by them.\n\nThe three major social groups that provided the leadership of the revolution were the primates (wealthy landowners who controlled about a third of the arable land in the Peloponnese), the captains drawn from the ''klephts'' and/or ''armatolos'' (''klepts'' and ''armatolos'' tended to alternate), and the wealthy merchants, who were the most Westernised elements in Greek society.<ref>Brewer, David ''The Greek War of Independence'', London: Overlook Duckworth, 2011 pages 126-127</ref> One of the more prominent leaders of the merchants and a \"Westerniser\" was the Phanariot [[Alexandros Mavrokordatos]] who was living with the poet [[Percy Bysshe Shelley]] and his wife [[Mary Shelley]] in Pisa when the revolution began, and upon hearing of the revolution, purchased supplies and a ship in Marseilles and then set sail for Greece.<ref name=\"Brewer, David page 127\">Brewer, David ''The Greek War of Independence'', London: Overlook Duckworth, 2011 page 127.</ref> Mavrokordhatos's wealth, education (he was fluent in seven languages) and his experience as an Ottoman official ruling Wallachia led many to look towards him as a leader.<ref name=\"Brewer, David page 127\"/>\n\nWhen [[Demetrios Ypsilantis]] arrived in Peloponnese as official representative of Filiki Eteria, he tried to assume control of the Revolution's affairs, and he thus proposed a new system of electing the members of the Senate, which was supported by the military leaders, but opposed by the notables.{{cref|vi}} Assemblies convened also in Central Greece (November 1821) under the leadership of two Phanariots: [[Alexandros Mavrokordatos]] in the western part, and [[Theodoros Negris]] in the eastern part. These assemblies adopted two [[Greek local statutes|local statutes]], the Charter of Western Continental Greece and the Legal Order of Eastern Continental Greece, drafted mainly by Mavrokordatos and Negris respectively.

On 9&nbsp;August 1825, led by Dimitrios Kallergis and Emmanouil Antoniadis, this group of Cretans captured the fort at [[Gramvousa]] and other insurgents captured the fort at [[Kissamos]], and attempted to spread the insurgency further afield.<ref>Detorakis, ''Turkish rule in Crete'', p. 381</ref>\n\nAlthough the Ottomans did not manage to retake the forts, they were successful in blocking the spread of the insurgency to the island's western provinces.

Gramvousa became a hive of piratical activity that greatly affected Turkish\u2013Egyptian and European shipping in the region.

The ideals and patriotic songs of Rigas Feraios and others had made a profound impression upon the Thessalonians. \u0391 few years later, the revolutionary fervour of the southern Greeks was to spread to these parts, and the seeds of Filiki Eteria were speedily to take root. The leader and coordinator of the revolution in Macedonia was [[Emmanouel Pappas]] from the village of [[Emmanouil Pappas|Dobista]], [[Serres (regional unit)|Serres]], who was initiated into the Filiki Eteria in 1819. Pappas had considerable influence over the local Ottoman authorities, especially the local governor, Ismail Bey, and offered much of his personal wealth for the cause.<ref>Vacalopoulos, ''History of Macedonia''</ref>\n\nFollowing the instructions of Alexander Ypsilantis, that is to prepare the ground and to rouse the inhabitants of Macedonia to rebellion, Pappas loaded arms and munitions from Constantinople on a ship on 23 March and proceeded to [[Mount Athos]], considering that this would be the most suitable spring-board for starting the insurrection. As Vacalopoulos notes, however, \"adequate preparations for rebellion had not been made, nor were revolutionary ideals to be reconciled with the ideological world of the monks within the Athonite regime\".<ref>Vacalopoulos, ''History of Macedonia'', p.592</ref> On 8 May, the Turks, infuriated by the landing of sailors from [[Psara]] at [[Stomio, Larissa|Tsayezi]], by the capture of Turkish merchants and the seizure of their goods, rampaged through the streets of Serres, searched the houses of the notables for arms, imprisoned the Metropolitan and 150 merchants, and seized their goods as a reprisal for the plundering by the Psarians.<ref>Vacalopoulos, ''History of Macedonia'', pp.&nbsp;594\u2013595</ref>\n\nIn Thessaloniki, governor Yusuf Bey (the son of Ismail Bey) imprisoned in his headquarters more than 400 hostages, of whom more than 100 were monks from the monastic estates. He also wished to seize the powerful notables of [[Polygyros]], who got wind of his intentions and fled. On 17 May, the Greeks of Polygyros took up arms, killed the local governor and 14 of his men, and wounded three others; they also repulsed two Turkish detachments. On 18 May, when Yusuf learned of the incidents at Polygyros and the spreading of the insurrection to the villages of [[Chalkidiki]], he ordered half of his hostages to be slaughtered before his eyes. The Mulla of Thessalonica, Hayr\u0131\u00fclah, gives the following description of Yusuf's retaliations:\n{{quote|Every day and every night you hear nothing in the streets of Thessaloniki but shouting and moaning.

In June 1821 the insurgents tried to cut communications between [[Thrace]] and the south, attempting to prevent the ''[[serasker]]'' Haji Muhammad Bayram Pasha from transferring forces from Asia Minor to southern Greece. Even though the rebels delayed him, they were ultimately defeated at the pass of [[Rentina, Thessaloniki|Rentina]].<ref>Vacalopoulos, ''History of Macedonia'', p.609</ref>\n\nThe insurrection in Chalkidiki was, from then on, confined to the peninsulas of Mount Athos and Kassandra. On 30 October 1821, an offensive led by the new Pasha of Thessaloniki, Muhammad Emin Abulubud, resulted in a decisive Ottoman victory at Kassandra. The survivors, among them Pappas, were rescued by the Psarian fleet, which took them mainly to [[Skiathos]], [[Skopelos]] and [[Skyros]]. However, Pappas died en route to join the revolution at [[Hydra, Saronic Islands|Hydra]]. [[Sithonia]], Mount Athos and Thasos subsequently surrendered on terms.<ref>Vacalopoulos, ''History of Macedonia'', pp.&nbsp;615\u2013619</ref>\n\nNevertheless, the revolt spread from [[central Macedonia|Central]] to [[Western Macedonia]], from [[Mount Olympus|Olympus]] to [[Pieria (regional unit)|Pieria]] and [[Vermion Mountains|Vermion]]. In the autumn of 1821, Nikolaos Kasomoulis was sent to southern Greece as the \"representative of South-East Macedonia\", and met Demetrius Ypsilantis. He then wrote to Papas from Hydra, asking him to visit Olympus to meet the captains there and to \"fire them with the required patriotic enthusiasm\".<ref>Vacalopoulos, ''History of Macedonia'', pp.&nbsp;627\u2013628</ref> At the beginning of 1822, [[Anastasios Karatasos]] and [[Aggelis Gatsos]] arranged a meeting with other ''armatoloi''; they decided that the insurrection should be based on three towns: [[Naousa, Imathia|Naoussa]], [[Kastania (Pieria), Greece|Kastania]], and [[Siatista]].<ref>Vacalopoulos, ''History of Macedonia'', pp.&nbsp;628\u2013629</ref>\n\nIn March 1822, Mehmed Emin secured decisive victories at [[Kolindros]] and Kastania.<ref>Vacalopoulos, ''History of Macedonia'', pp.&nbsp;633\u2013636</ref> Further north, in the vicinity of Naousa, [[Zafeirakis Theodosiou]], Karatasos and Gatsos organized the city's defense, and the first clashes resulted in a victory for the Greeks. Mehmed Emin then appeared before the town with 10,000 regular troops and 10,600 irregulars. Failing to get the insurgents to surrender, Mehmed Emin launched a number of attacks pushing them further back and finally captured Naousa in April, helped by the enemies of Zafeirakis, who had revealed an unguarded spot, the \"Alonia\".<ref>Vacalopoulos, ''History of Macedonia'', pp.&nbsp;635\u2013637</ref> Reprisals and executions ensued, and women are reported to have flung themselves over the Arapitsa waterfall to avoid dishonor and being sold in slavery.

They landed at Asprovrisi of Lapithou. Kanaris brought with him papers from the Filiki Etaireia and the ships were welcomed with rapturous applause and patriotic cries from the local Greeks of the area, who helped Kanaris and the soldiers from Cyprus as much as they could.\n\nKanaris brought with him to mainland  Greece, Cypriots who created the \"Column of Cypriots\" (\u00ab\u03a6\u03ac\u03bb\u03b1\u03b3\u03b3\u03b1 \u03c4\u03c9\u03bd \u039a\u03c5\u03c0\u03c1\u03af\u03c9\u03bd\u00bb), led by General Chatzipetros, which fought with extraordinary heroism in Greece. In total, over 1000 Cypriots fought in the War of Independence, many of whom died. At Missolonghi many were killed, and at the Battle of Athens in 1827, around 130 were killed. General Chatzipetros, showing military decorations declared \"These were given to me by the heroism and braveness of the Column of Cypriots\". In the National Library, there is a list of 580 names of Cypriots who fought in the War between 1821 and 1829.\n\nThe Cypriot battalion brought with them their own distinctive war banner, consisting of a white flag with a large blue cross, and the words ''GREEK FLAG OF THE MOTHERLAND CYPRUS'' emblazoned in the top left corner. The flag was hoisted on a wooden mast, carved and pointed at the end to act as a lance in battle. The legendary battle flag is currently stored at the National Historical Museum of Athens.\n\n[[File:\u0391\u03c1\u03c7\u03b9\u03b5\u03c0\u03af\u03c3\u03ba\u03bf\u03c0\u03bf\u03c2 \u039a\u03cd\u03c0\u03c1\u03bf\u03c5 \u039a\u03c5\u03c0\u03c1\u03b9\u03b1\u03bd\u03cc\u03c2.jpg|left|thumb|180px|Painting of the Archbishop [[Kyprianos of Cyprus]]]]\n\nThroughout the War of Independence, supplies were brought from Cyprus by the Filiki Etairia to aid the Greek struggle. The Greeks of Cyprus underwent great risk to provide these supplies, and secretly load them onto boats arriving at intervals from Greece, as the Ottoman rulers in Cyprus at the time were very wary of Cypriot insurgency and sentenced to death any Greek Cypriots found aiding the Greek cause. Incidences of these secret loading trips from Cyprus were recorded by the French consul to Cyprus, Mechain.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.synexelixi.org/el/component/content/article/60-kypros-1821 |title=Archived copy |access-date=22 June 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120325235958/http://www.synexelixi.org/el/component/content/article/60-kypros-1821 |archive-date=25 March 2012 |url-status=dead |df=dmy-all }}</ref>\n\nBack in Cyprus during the war, the local population suffered greatly at the hands of the Ottoman rulers of the islands, who were quick to act with great severity at any act of patriotism and sympathy of the Greeks of Cyprus to the Revolution, fearing a similar uprising in Cyprus. The religious leader of the Greeks of the island at the time, [[Archbishop Kyprianos]] was initiated into the Filiki Etairia in 1818 and had promised to aid the cause of the Greek Helladites with food and money.\n\nIn early July 1821, the Cypriot Archimandrite Theofylaktos Thiseas arrived in [[Larnaca]] as a messenger of the Filiki Etairia, bringing orders to Kyprianos, while proclamations were distributed in every corner of the island. However, the local pasha, K\u00fc\u00e7\u00fck Pasha, intercepted these messages and reacted with fury, calling in reinforcements, confiscating weapons and arresting several prominent Cypriots. Archbishop Kyprianos was urged (by his friends) to leave the island as the situation worsened, but refused to do so.\n\nOn 9 July 1821 K\u00fc\u00e7\u00fck Pasha had the gates to the walled city of Nicosia closed and executed, by beheading or hanging, 470 important Cypriots amongst them Chrysanthos (bishop of Paphos), Meletios (bishop of Kition) and Lavrentios (bishop of Kyrenia). The next day, all abbots and monks of monasteries in Cyprus were executed. In addition, the Ottomans arrested all the Greek leaders of the villages and imprisoned them before executing them, as they were suspected of inspiring patriotism in their local population.\n\nIn total, it is estimated that over 2,000 Greeks of Cyprus were slaughtered as an act of revenge for participating in the revolution. This was a very significant proportion of the total population of the island at the time. K\u00fc\u00e7\u00fck pasha had declared ''\"I have in my mind to slaughter the Greeks in Cyprus, to hang them, to not leave a soul...\"'' before undertaking these massacres. From 9 to 14 July, the Ottomans killed all prisoners on the list of the pasha, and in the next 30 days, looting and massacres spread throughout Cyprus as 4,000 Turkish soldiers from Syria arrived on the island.\n\nArchbishop Kyprianos was defiant in his death. He was aware of his fate and impending death, yet stood by the Greek cause. He is revered throughout Cyprus as a noble patriot and defender of the Orthodox faith and Hellenic cause. An English explorer by the name of Carne spoke to the Archbishop before the events of 9 July, who was quoted as saying: \"My death is not far away. I know they [the Ottoman] are waiting for an opportunity to kill me\". Kyprianos chose to stay, despite these fears, and provide protection and counsel for the people of Cyprus as their leader.\n\nHe was publicly hanged from a tree opposite the former palace of the Lusignan Kings of Cyprus on 19 July 1821. The events leading up to his execution were documented in an epic poem written in the Cypriot dialect by [[Vassilis Michaelides]].\n\n===War at sea===\n[[File:Aris figurehead of Tsamadoy ship.jpg|thumb|upright|left|The [[figurehead]] of [[Anastasios Tsamados]]\u2019 famous brig [[Greek brig Aris|Aris]], today in the [[National Historical Museum, Athens]].]]\n\nFrom the early stages of the revolution, success at sea was vital for the Greeks. When they failed to counter the [[Ottoman Navy]], it was able to resupply the isolated Ottoman garrisons and land reinforcements from the [[Ottoman Empire]]'s provinces, theatening to crush the rebellion; likewise the failure of the Greek fleet to break the naval blocade of Missolonghi (as it did several times earlier) in 1826 led to the fall of the city.\n\nThe Greek fleet was primarily outfitted by prosperous Aegean islanders, principally from three islands: [[Hydra, Saronic Islands|Hydra]], [[Spetses]] and [[Psara]]. Each island equipped, manned and maintained its own squadron, under its own admiral.<ref name=\"Brewer, pp. 89\u201391\">Brewer, pp. 89\u201391.</ref> Although they were manned by experienced crews, the Greek ships were not designed for warfare, equipped with only light guns and staffed by armed merchantmen.<ref name=\"Brewer, pp. 89\u201391\"/> Against them stood the Ottoman fleet, which enjoyed several advantages: its ships and supporting craft were built for war; it was supported by the resources of the vast Ottoman Empire; command was centralized and disciplined under the [[Kapudan Pasha]]. The total Ottoman fleet size consisted of 20 three-masted [[ship of the line|ships of the line]], each with about 80 guns and 7 or 8 [[frigate]]s with 50 guns, 5 corvettes with about 30 guns and around 40 [[brig]]s with 20 or fewer guns.<ref>Brewer, pp. 91\u201392.</ref>\n\n[[File:\u039a\u03c9\u03bd\u03c3\u03c4\u03b1\u03bd\u03c4\u03af\u03bd\u03bf\u03c2 \u0392\u03bf\u03bb\u03b1\u03bd\u03ac\u03ba\u03b7\u03c2 - \u03a4\u03bf \u03ba\u03ac\u03c8\u03b9\u03bc\u03bf \u03c4\u03b7\u03c2 \u03c4\u03bf\u03c5\u03c1\u03ba\u03b9\u03ba\u03ae\u03c2 \u03c6\u03c1\u03b5\u03b3\u03ac\u03c4\u03b1\u03c2.jpg|thumb|240px|\"The burning of the Ottoman frigate at Eressos by [[Dimitrios Papanikolis]]\" by [[Konstantinos Volanakis]]]]\n\nIn the face of this situation, the Greeks decided to use [[fire ship]]s ({{lang-el|\u03c0\u03c5\u03c1\u03c0\u03bf\u03bb\u03b9\u03ba\u03ac or \u03bc\u03c0\u03bf\u03c5\u03c1\u03bb\u03cc\u03c4\u03b1}}), which had proven themselves effective for the Psarians during the [[Orlov Revolt]] in 1770. The first test was made at [[Eresos]] on 27 May 1821, when an Ottoman frigate was successfully destroyed by a fire ship under [[Dimitrios Papanikolis]]. In the fire ships, the Greeks found an effective weapon against the Ottoman vessels. In subsequent years, the successes of the Greek fire ships would increase their reputation, with acts such as the destruction of the Ottoman flagship by [[Constantine Kanaris]] at [[Chios]], after the [[Chios Massacre|massacre of the island's population in June 1822]], acquiring international fame. {{citation needed span|Overall, 59 fire ship attacks were carried out, of which 39 were successful.|date=August 2017}}\n\nAt the same time, conventional naval actions were also fought, at which naval commanders like [[Andreas Vokos Miaoulis|Andreas Miaoulis]] distinguished themselves. The early successes of the Greek fleet in direct confrontations with the Ottomans at Patras and Spetses gave the crews confidence and contributed greatly to the survival and success of the uprising in the Peloponnese.\n\nLater, however, as Greece became embroiled in a civil war, the Sultan called upon his strongest subject, [[Muhammad Ali of Egypt]], for aid. Plagued by internal strife and financial difficulties in keeping the fleet in constant readiness, the Greeks failed to prevent the capture and destruction of [[Kasos]] and [[Destruction of Psara|Psara]] in 1824, or the landing of the Egyptian army at [[Methoni, Messenia|Methoni]]. Despite victories at [[Samos Island|Samos]] and Gerontas, the Revolution was threatened with collapse until the intervention of the Great Powers in the [[Battle of Navarino]] in 1827.\n\n==1822\u20131824==\n[[File:Mavrokordatos by Hess.jpg|thumb|180px|\"[[Alexandros Mavrokordatos]], president of the Executive, defends Missolonghi\" (''[[First Siege of Missolonghi]]''), by [[Peter von Hess]].]]\n[[File:Dionysios Solomos - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|180px|[[Dionysios Solomos]] wrote in 1823 the ''[[Hymn to Liberty]]'', which later became the National Greek anthem.]]\n\nRevolutionary activity was fragmented because of the lack of strong central leadership and guidance.

The Assembly drafted the [[Greek Constitution of 1822|first Greek Constitution]] and appointed the members of an executive and a legislative body that were to govern the liberated territories. Mavrokordatos saved the office of president of the executive for himself, while Ypsilantis, who had called for the Assembly, was elected president of the legislative body, a place of limited significance.<ref>Dakin, ''The Greek Struggle for independence'', pp. 87\u20139.</ref>\n\nMilitary leaders and representatives of Filiki Eteria were marginalized, but gradually Kolokotronis' political influence grew, and he soon managed to control, along with the captains he influenced, the Peloponnesian Senate. The central administration tried to marginalize Kolokotronis, who also had under his control the fort of [[Nafplion]]. In November 1822, the central administration decided that the new National Assembly would take place in Nafplion, and asked Kolokotronis to return the fort to the government. Kolokotronis refused, and the Assembly was finally gathered in March 1823 in [[Astros, Greece|Astros]]. Central governance was strengthened at the expense of regional bodies, a [[Greek Constitution of 1823|new constitution]] was voted, and new members were elected for the executive and the legislative bodies.<ref>Rotzokos, \"Civil Wars\", 143\u2013151</ref>\n\nTrying to coax the military leaders, the central administration proposed to Kolokotronis that he participate in the executive body as vice-president. Kolokotronis accepted, but he caused a serious crisis when he prevented Mavrokordatos, who had been elected president of the legislative body, from assuming his position. His attitude towards Mavrokordatos caused outrage amongst the members of the legislative body.<ref>Rotzokos, \"Civil Wars\", 152\u2013154</ref>\n\nThe crisis culminated when the legislature, which was controlled by the Roumeliotes and the Hydriots, overturned the executive, and fired its president, Petros Mavromichalis. Kolokotronis and most of the Peloponnesian notables and captains supported Mavromichalis, who remained president of his executive in Tripolitsa. However, a second executive, supported by the islanders, the Roumeliotes, and some Achaean notables\u2014[[Andreas Zaimis]] and [[Andreas Londos]] were the most prominent\u2014was formed at [[Kranidi]] with [[Georgios Kountouriotis|Kountouriotis]] as president.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">Dimitropoulos, ''Theodoros Kolokotronis'', 79\u201381<br/>* Rotzokos, \"Civil Wars\", 154\u2013161</ref>\n\nIn March 1824, the forces of the new executive besieged Nafplion and Tripolitsa. After one month of fighting and negotiations, an agreement was reached between Kolokotronis, from one side, and Londos and Zaimis, from the other side. On 22 May, the first phase of the civil war officially ended, but most of the members of the new executive were displeased by the moderate terms of the agreement that Londos and Zaimis brokered.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/>\n\nDuring this period, the two first installments of the English loan had arrived, and the position of the government was strengthened; but the infighting was not yet over. Zaimis and the other Peloponnesians who supported Kountouriotis came into conflict with the executive body, and allied with Kolokotronis, who roused the residents of Tripolitsa against the local tax collectors of the government. Papaflessas and Makriyannis failed to suppress the rebellion, but Kolokotronis remained inactive for some period, overwhelmed by the death of his son, Panos.<ref name=\"ReferenceB\">Dimitropoulos, ''Theodoros Kolokotronis'', 79\u201381<br/>* Rotzokos, \"Civil Wars\", 164\u2013170.</ref>\n\nThe government regrouped its armies, which now consisted mainly of Roumeliotes and Souliotes, led by [[Ioannis Kolettis]], who wanted a complete victory. Under Kolettis' orders, two bodies of Roumeliotes and Souliotes invaded the Peloponnese: the first under Gouras occupied [[Corinth]] and raided the province; the second under Karaiskakis, [[Kitsos Tzavelas]] and others, attacked in Achaea, Lindos and \"Zaimis\". In January 1825, a Roumeliote force, led by Kolettis himself, arrested Kolokotronis, Deligiannis' family and others.

They recognized the degeneration of the [[Ottoman Empire]], but they did not know how to handle this situation (a problem known as the \"Eastern Question\"). Afraid of the complications the partition of the empire might raise, the British foreign minister [[Robert Stewart, Viscount Castlereagh|Viscount Castlereagh]], Austrian foreign minister Prince [[Prince Klemens Wenzel von Metternich|Metternich]], and the Tsar of Russia [[Alexander I of Russia|Alexander I]] shared the same view concerning the necessity of preserving the ''status quo'' and the peace of Europe. They also pleaded that they maintain the [[Concert of Europe]].\n\nMetternich also tried to undermine the Russian foreign minister, [[Ioannis Kapodistrias]], who was of Greek origin. Kapodistrias demanded that Alexander declare war on the Ottomans in order to liberate Greece and increase the greatness of Russia. Metternich persuaded Alexander that Kapodistrias was in league with the Italian [[Carbonari]] (an Italian revolutionary group), leading Alexander to disavow him. As a result of the Russian reaction to Alexander Ypsilantis, Kapodistrias resigned as foreign minister and moved to [[Switzerland]].<ref>Troyat, ''Alexander of Russia'', pp. 269\u2013270</ref>\n\nNevertheless, Alexander's position was ambivalent, since he regarded himself as the protector of the Orthodox Church, and his subjects were deeply moved by the hanging of the Patriarch. These factors explain why, after denouncing the Greek Revolution, Alexander dispatched an ultimatum to Constantinople on 27 July 1821, after the Greek massacres in the city and the hanging of the Patriarch.\n\nHowever, the danger of war passed temporarily, after Metternich and Castlereagh persuaded the Sultan to make some concessions to the Tsar.<ref>Stavrianos, ''The Balkans since 1453'', pp. 286\u2013288</ref> On 14 December 1822, the Holy Alliance denounced the Greek Revolution, considering it audacious.\n\n===Change of stance===\n{{multiple image\n| align = right\n| image1 = George Canning by Richard Evans.jpg\n| width1 = 175\n| alt1 = \n| caption1 = \n| image2 = Nicholasbotman(1).jpg\n| width2 = 210\n| alt2 = \n| caption2 = \n| footer = Left: [[George Canning]] was the architect of the [[Treaty of London (1827)|Treaty of London]], which launched European intervention in the Greek conflict.<br />Right:[[Tsar Nicholas I]] co-signed the Treaty of London, and then launched the [[Russo-Turkish War (1828\u20131829)|Russo-Turkish War]] of 1828\u20131829, which finally secured Greek independence.\n}}\n\nIn August 1822, [[George Canning]] was appointed by the British government as Foreign Secretary, succeeding Castlereagh. Canning was influenced by the mounting popular agitation against the Ottomans, and believed that a settlement could no longer be postponed. He also feared that Russia might undertake unilateral action against the Ottoman Empire.<ref>Stavrianos, ''The Balkans since 1453'', p. 288</ref>\n\nIn March 1823, Canning declared that \"when a whole nation revolts against its conqueror, the nation cannot be considered as piratical but as a nation in a state of war\". In February 1823 he notified the Ottoman Empire that Britain would maintain friendly relations with the Turks only under the condition that the latter respected the Christian subjects of the Empire. The Commissioner of the [[Ionian Islands]], which belonged to Britain, was ordered to consider the Greeks in a state of war and give them the right to cut off certain areas from which the Turks could get provisions.<ref name=\"Br52\" />\n\nThese measures led to the increase of British influence. This influence was reinforced by the issuing of two loans that the Greeks managed to conclude with British fund-holders in 1824 and 1825. These loans, which, in effect, made the City of London the financier of the revolution,<ref name=\"Br52\" /> inspired the creation of the \"British\" political party in Greece, whose opinion was that the revolution could only end in success with the help of Britain. At the same time, parties affiliated to Russia and France made their appearance. These parties would later strive for power during king Otto's reign.<ref>\"Newer and Modern History\"(\u0399\u03c3\u03c4\u03bf\u03c1\u03af\u03b1 \u039d\u03b5\u03cc\u03c4\u03b5\u03c1\u03b7 \u03ba\u03b1\u03b9 \u03a3\u03cd\u03b3\u03c7\u03c1\u03bf\u03bd\u03b7), Vas.

Metternich  dismissively wrote, \"If the Irish were to revolt against the British Crown, and the King of France were to offer to mediate,\" leading him to ask: \"Is England then ready to regard as a Power equal to rights to that of the [British] King the first Irish Club which declares itself the Insurgent Government of Ireland? To regard as justified the French Power which would accept the office of mediator, by reason of the sole fact that the invitation had been addressed to it by the Irish Government?...Whither does this absurdity not lead us?\".<ref name=\"Brewer, David pages 257\">Brewer, David ''The Greek War of Independence'', London: Overlook Duckworth, 2011 pages 257.</ref> Prussia, whose king Frederich Wilhelm was close to Metternich, chose to follow the Austrian lead.<ref name=\"Brewer, David pages 257\"/> Before he met with Wellington, the Tsar had already sent an ultimatum to the Porte, demanding that the principalities be evacuated immediately, and that plenipotentiaries be sent to Russia to settle outstanding issues. The Sultan agreed to send the plenipotentiaries, and on 7 October 1826 signed the [[Akkerman Convention]], in which Russian demands concerning Serbia and the principalities were accepted.<ref>Stavrianos, ''The Balkans since 1453'', pp. 288\u2013289</ref>\n\nThe Greeks formally applied for the mediation provided in the Petersburg Protocol, while the Turks and the Egyptians showed no willingness to stop fighting.<ref>Brewer, David ''The Greek War of Independence The Struggle for Freedom from Ottoman Oppression'', London: Overlook Duckworth, 2011 page 316</ref> France, which initially backed its client Muhammad Ali the Great with weapons and officers to train his army, changed its stance, partly because of the pro-Greek feelings of the French people, and partly because King [[Charles X of France|Charles X]] saw the offer to impose mediation as a way of assuring French influence in Greece.<ref>Brewer, David ''The Greek War of Independence The Struggle for Freedom from Ottoman Oppression'', London: Overlook Duckworth, 2011 pages 316-317</ref> Since Britain and Russia were going to impose mediation with or without France, if the French declined the offer to impose mediation, Greece would be in the Anglo-Russian sphere of influence, while if the French did take part, then Greece would also be in the French sphere of influence.<ref>Brewer, David ''The Greek War of Independence The Struggle for Freedom from Ottoman Oppression'', London: Overlook Duckworth, 2011 page 317</ref> Canning therefore prepared for action by negotiating the [[Treaty of London (1827)|Treaty of London]] (6 July 1827) with France and Russia. This provided that the Allies should again offer negotiations, and if the Sultan rejected it, they would exert all the means which circumstances would allow to force the cessation of hostilities. Meanwhile, news reached Greece in late July 1827 that Muhammad Ali's new fleet was completed in [[Alexandria]] and sailing towards [[Pylos|Navarino]] to join the rest of the Egyptian-Turkish fleet. The aim of this fleet was to attack Hydra and knock the island's fleet out of the war. On 29 August, the Porte formally rejected the Treaty of London's stipulations, and, subsequently, the commanders-in-chief of the [[Mediterranean Fleet (United Kingdom)|British]] and [[Mediterranean Fleet (France)|French]] Mediterranean fleets, Admiral [[Edward Codrington]] and Admiral [[Henri de Rigny]], sailed into the Gulf of Argos and requested to meet with Greek representatives on board {{HMS|Asia|1824|6}}.<ref name=\"Howarth231\">Howarth, ''The Greek Adventure'', p. 231</ref>\n\n==== Battle of Navarino (1827)====\n{{Main|Battle of Navarino}}\n[[File:ModernEgypt, Muhammad Ali by Auguste Couder, BAP 17996.jpg|thumb|upright|Portrait of [[Muhammad Ali Pasha]] (by [[Auguste Couder]], 1841, [[Palace of Versailles]]), whose expedition to the Peloponnese precipitated European intervention in the Greek conflict.]]\n\nAfter the Greek delegation, led by Mavrocordatos, accepted the terms of the treaty, the Allies prepared to insist upon the armistice, and their fleets were instructed to intercept supplies destined for Ibrahim's forces. When Muhammad Ali's fleet, which had been warned by the British and French to stay away from Greece, left Alexandria and joined other Ottoman/Egyptian units at Navarino on 8 September, Codrington arrived with his squadron off Navarino on 12 September. On 13 October, Codrington was joined, off Navarino, by his allied support, a French squadron under De Rigny and a Russian squadron under [[Login Petrovich Geiden|Login Geiden]].<ref name=\"Howarth233-34\">Howarth, ''The Greek Adventure'', pp. 231\u201334.</ref>\n\nUpon their arrival at Navarino, Codgrinton and de Rigny tried to negotiate with Ibrahim, but Ibrahim insisted that by the Sultan's order he must destroy Hydra. Codrington responded by saying that if Ibrahim's fleets attempted to go anywhere but home, he would have to destroy them. Ibrahim agreed to write to the Sultan to see if he would change his orders, but he also complained about the Greeks being able to continue their attacks. Codrington promised that he would stop the Greeks and Philhellenes from attacking the Turks and Egyptians. After doing this, he disbanded most of his fleet, which returned to Malta, while the French went to the Aegean.<ref name=\"Howarth233-34\"/>\n\nHowever, when [[Frank Abney Hastings|Frank Hastings]], a [[Philhellenism|Philhellene]], destroyed a Turkish naval squadron during a [[Battle of Itea|raid off Itea]], Ibrahim sent a detachment of his fleet out of Navarino in order to defeat Hastings. Codrington had not heard of Hastings's actions and thought that Ibrahim was breaking his agreement. Codrington intercepted the force and made them retreat and did so again on the following day when Ibrahim led the fleet in person. Codrington assembled his fleet once more, with the British returning from Malta and the French from the Aegean. They were also joined by the Russian contingent led by Count Login Geiden. Ibrahim now began a campaign to annihilate the Greeks of the Peloponnese as he thought the Allies had reneged on their agreement.<ref name=\"Howarth236-37\">Howarth, ''The Greek Adventure'', pp. 236\u201337.</ref>\n\n[[File:Naval Battle of Navarino by Garneray.jpg|thumb|upright=1.4|left|''The Naval [[Battle of Navarino]]'' by [[Ambroise Louis Garneray]] (1827).]]\n\nOn 20 October 1827, as the weather got worse, the British, Russian and French fleets entered the Bay of Navarino in peaceful formation to shelter themselves and to make sure that the Egyptian-Turkish fleet did not slip off and attack Hydra. When a British [[frigate]] sent a boat to request the Egyptians to move their fire ships, the officer on board was shot by the Egyptians. The frigate responded with musket fire in retaliation and an Egyptian ship fired a cannon shot at the French flagship, the Sirene, which returned fire.<ref name=\"Howarth239\">Howarth, ''The Greek Adventure'', p. 239.</ref> A full engagement was begun which ended in a complete victory for the Allies and in the annihilation of the Egyptian-Turkish fleet. Of the 89 Egyptian-Turkish ships that took part in the battle, only 14 made it back to Alexandria and their dead amounted to over 8,000. The Allies did not lose a ship and suffered only 181 deaths. The Porte demanded compensation from the Allies for the ships, but his demand was refused on the grounds that the Turks had acted as the aggressors. The three countries' ambassadors also left Constantinople.<ref name=\"Howarth241\">Howarth, ''The Greek Adventure'', p. 241.</ref>\n\nIn Britain, the battle was criticized as being an 'untoward event' towards Turkey, which was called an 'ancient ally'. Codrington was recalled and blamed for having allowed the retreating Egyptian-Turkish ships to carry 2,000 Greek slaves. In France, the news of the battle was greeted with great enthusiasm and the government had an unexpected surge in popularity. Russia formally took the opportunity to declare war on the Turks (April 1828).<ref name=\"Howarth241\"/>\n[[File:Entrevue du g\u00e9n\u00e9ral Maison et d'Ibrahim Pacha, \u00e0 Navarin, septembre 1828.jpg|thumb|310x310px|''[[Nicolas Joseph Maison|General Maison]] meeting [[Ibrahim Pasha of Egypt|Ibrahim Pasha]] in [[Pylos|Navarino]] in September 1828'' (by [[Jean-Charles Langlois]],1838, [[Palace of Versailles]]).]]\n\nIn October 1828, the Greeks regrouped and formed a new government under [[Ioannis Kapodistrias|Kapodistrias]]. Kapodistrias took advantage of the Russo-Turkish war and sent troops of the reorganised [[Hellenic Army]] to [[Central Greece]]. They advanced to seize as much territory as possible, including [[Athens]] and [[Thebes (Greece)|Thebes]], before the Western powers imposed a ceasefire. These Greek victories were proved decisive for the including of more territories in the future State. As far as the Peloponnese was concerned, Britain and Russia accepted the offer of France to send an army to expel Ibrahim's forces. [[Nicolas Joseph Maison]], who was given command of a [[Morea expedition|French expeditionary Corps]] of 15,000 men, landed on 30 August 1828 at [[Petalidi]] and helped the Greeks evacuate the Peloponnese from all the hostile troops by 30 October.

Greek forces under Demetrius Ypsilantis, for the first time trained to fight as a regular European army rather than as guerrilla bands, advanced against Aslan Bey's forces and defeated them.

There is debate among scholars over whether the massacres committed by the Greeks should be regarded as a response to prior events (such as the massacre of the Greeks of Tripoli, after the failed [[Orlov Revolt]] of 1770 and the destruction of the [[Sacred Band (1821)|Sacred Band]]<ref>Booras, ''Hellenic Independence and America's Contribution to the Cause''. p. 24.<br />* Brewer, ''The Greek War of Independence'', p. 64.</ref>) or as separate atrocities, which started simultaneously with the outbreak of the revolt.<ref>Finlay, ''History of the Greek Revolution'', I, 171\u2013172<br />* Jelavich, ''History of the Balkans'', p. 217<br />* St. Clair, ''That Greece Might still Be Free'', pp. 1\u20133, 12</ref>\n\nDuring the war, tens of thousands of Greek civilians were killed, left to die or taken into slavery.<ref>St. Clair, ''That Greece Might still Be Free'', pp. 80\u201381, 92</ref> Most of the Greeks in the Greek quarter of Constantinople were massacred.<ref>[[Fisher, H.A.L]], ''A History of Europe'', (Edward Arnold, London, 1936 & 1965) p. 882</ref> A large number of Christian clergymen were also killed, including the Ecumenical Patriarch Gregory V.{{cref|viii}}\n\nSometimes marked as allies of the Turks in the Peloponnese, Jewish settlements were also massacred by Greek revolutionaries; Steve Bowman argues that the tragedy may have been more a side-effect of the butchering of the Turks of Tripolis, the last Ottoman stronghold in the South, where the Jews had taken refuge from the fighting, than a specific action against Jews as such. Many Jews around Greece and throughout Europe were supporters of the Greek revolt, using their resources to loan substantial amounts to the newly formed Greek government. In turn, the success of the Greek Revolution was to stimulate the incipient stirrings of Jewish nationalism, later called [[Zionism]].<ref name=\"Rivlin\">Bowman, \"The Jews of Greece\", [http://www.umass.edu/judaic/anniversaryvolume/articles/30-F3-Bowman.pdf 421\u2013422] (PDF)</ref>\n\n==Aftermath==\n[[File:Theodoros Vryzakis, Grateful Hellas (1858).jpg|thumb|left|upright|\"Grateful Hellas\" by [[Theodoros Vryzakis]]]]\n\nThe consequences of the Greek revolution were somewhat ambiguous in the immediate aftermath. An independent Greek state had been established, but with Britain, Russia and France claiming a major role in Greek politics, an imported Bavarian dynast as ruler, and a mercenary army.<ref name=\"Jelavich229-34\">Jelavich, ''History of the Balkans'', pp.&nbsp;229\u201334.</ref> The country had been ravaged by ten years of fighting and was full of displaced refugees and empty Turkish estates, necessitating a series of land reforms over several decades.<ref name=\"Sowards\"/>\n\nThe population of the new state numbered 800,000, representing less than one-third of the 2.5&nbsp;million Greek inhabitants of the Ottoman Empire. During a great part of the next century, the Greek state sought the liberation of the \"[[irredentism|unredeemed]]\" Greeks of the Ottoman Empire, in accordance with the [[Megali Idea]], i.e., the goal of uniting all Greeks in one country.<ref name=\"Sowards\"/>\n\nAs a people, the Greeks no longer provided the princes for the Danubian Principalities, and were regarded within the Ottoman Empire, especially by the Muslim population, as traitors. [[Phanariotes]], who had until then held high office within the Ottoman Empire, were thenceforth regarded as suspect, and lost their special, privileged status. In Constantinople and the rest of the Ottoman Empire where Greek banking and merchant presence had been dominant, Armenians mostly replaced Greeks in banking, and Jewish merchants gained importance.<ref name=\"Jelavich229\">Jelavich, ''History of the Balkans'', p. 229</ref>\n\n{| class=\"toccolours\" style=\"float: right; margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 2em; font-size: 85%; background:#c6dbf7; color:black; width:30em; max-width: 40%;\" cellspacing=\"5\"\n| style=\"text-align: left;\" | \"Today the fatherland is reborn, that for so long was lost and extinguished.

For the first time, a Christian subject people had achieved independence from Ottoman rule and established a fully independent state, recognized by Europe. Whereas previously, only large nations (such as the British or the French) were judged worthy of national self-determination by the Great Powers of Europe, the Greek Revolt legitimized the concept of small, ethnically-based nation-states, and emboldened nationalist movements among other subject peoples of the Ottoman Empire. The [[Serbs]], [[Bulgarians]], [[Albanians]], [[Romanians]] and [[Armenians]] all subsequently fought for and won their independence.\n\nShortly after the war ended, the people of the Russian-dependent [[Congress Poland|Poland]], encouraged by the Greek victory, started the [[November Uprising]], hoping to regain their independence. The uprising, however, failed, and Polish independence had to wait until 1918. The newly established Greek state would become a catalyst for further expansion and, over the course of a century, [[Macedonia (Greece)|parts of Macedonia]], [[Crete]], [[Epirus (region)|Epirus]], many [[Aegean Islands]] and other Greek-speaking territories would unite with the new Greek state.\nThe Greek rebels won the sympathy of even the conservative powers of Europe.\n\n==Revolutionary flags==\n<Center>\n<gallery>\nFile:YpsilantisFlag.svg|Flag of the [[Sacred Band (1821)|Sacred Band]]\nFile:Andreas Lontos Flag (Revolution1821).svg|Raised in [[Patras]] by [[Andreas Londos]]\nFile:Greek flag (black cross).svg|Flag from Thrace and Samothrace\nFile:1821 Flag of Spetses.svg|Flag of [[Spetses]] island\nFile:Athanasios Diakos 1821.svg|Flag of [[Athanasios Diakos]]\nFile:Mani Flag (Greece).svg|Flag of the [[Maniots]]\nFile:Thessalia-flag.jpg|Used in Thessaly, created by [[Anthimos Gazis]]\nFile:Flag of the Administration of Samos.svg|Flag of the [[Military-Political System of Samos]]\nFile:Greek Independence 1821.svg|Very widespread flag used by all the revolutionaries\n</gallery>\n</Center>\n\n==Legacy==\n{{See also|Celebration of the Greek Revolution}}\n\n===Music inspired by the Greek War of Independence===\nIn 1971, the [[Municipality of Thessaloniki]] commissioned a symphonic work for the 150th anniversary of the Greek Revolution.

[[Rigas Feraios]] (1757 \u2013 1798) was a very prominent poet and intellectual of Greek independence. Many of his poems urged the people of Greece to leave the cities, head to the mountains where they would have more freedom, and unite to gain their independence.\n\n[[Dionysios Solomos]] (1798 \u2013 1857) was another national poet inspired by the Greek War of Independence. Solomos wrote the [[Hymn to Liberty]] in 1823, two years after the Greeks started the war against the [[Ottoman Empire]]. The Hymn is 158 stanzas, making it one of the longest [[National Anthem]]s; however, officially, only the first two were adopted and sung. Not only is it the Greek anthem but also [[Cyprus]] adopted it as their own in 1966.\n\nTo this day, many songs are sung by Greeks worldwide on March 25 to [[Celebration of the Greek Revolution|celebrate their liberation]] and showcase their respect to the lives that were lost during the four hundred years Ottoman rule.\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+Music inspired by the Greek War of Independence\n!Song Name\n!Sung by\n!Released\n|-\n|'''Na'tane To 21'''\n\u039d\u03b1'\u03c4\u03b1\u03bd\u03b5 \u03a4\u03bf 21\n|[[George Dalaras]]\n\u0393\u03b9\u03ce\u03c1\u03b3\u03bf\u03c2 \u039d\u03c4\u03b1\u03bb\u03ac\u03c1\u03b1\u03c2\n|1970\n|-\n|'''O Thourios Tou Riga'''\n\u039f \u0398\u03bf\u03cd\u03c1\u03b9\u03bf\u03c2 \u03a4\u03bf\u03c5 \u03a1\u03ae\u03b3\u03b1\n|[[Nikos Xilouris]]\n\u039d\u03af\u03ba\u03bf\u03c2 \u039e\u03c5\u03bb\u03bf\u03cd\u03c1\u03b7\u03c2\n|1797 (the poem)\n|-\n|'''Ola Ta Ethni Polemoun'''\n'\u039f\u03bb\u03b1 \u03a4\u03b1 \u0388\u03b8\u03bd\u03b7 \u03c0\u03bf\u03bb\u03b5\u03bc\u03bf\u03cd\u03bd\n|Rigas Feraios & Christos Leontis\n\n\u03a1\u03ae\u03b3\u03b1\u03c2 \u03a6\u03b5\u03c1\u03b1\u03b9\u03cc\u03c2 & \u03a7\u03c1\u03ae\u03c3\u03c4\u03bf\u03c2 \u039b\u03b5\u03bf\u03bd\u03c4\u03ae\u03c2\n|N/A\n|-\n|'''Saranta Palikaria'''\n\u03a3\u03b1\u03c1\u03ac\u03bd\u03c4\u03b1 \u03a0\u03b1\u03bb\u03b9\u03ba\u03ac\u03c1\u03b9\u03b1\n|[[Stelios Kazantzidis]]\n\u03a3\u03c4\u03ad\u03bb\u03b9\u03bf\u03c2 \u039a\u03b1\u03b6\u03b1\u03bd\u03c4\u03b6\u03af\u03b4\u03b7\u03c2\n|N/A\n|-\n|'''Perifanoi Oloi'''\n\u03a0\u03b5\u03c1\u03ae\u03c6\u03b1\u03bd\u03bf\u03b9 \u0384\u039f\u03bb\u03bf\u03b9\n|Paschalis Arvanitidis\n\u03a0\u03b1\u03c3\u03c7\u03ac\u03bb\u03b7\u03c2 \u0391\u03c1\u03b2\u03b1\u03bd\u03b9\u03c4\u03af\u03b4\u03b7\u03c2\n|1967\n|-\n|'''Kleftiki Zoi'''\n\u039a\u03bb\u03ad\u03c6\u03c4\u03b9\u03ba\u03b7 \u0396\u03c9\u03ae\n|[[Loukianos Kilaidonis]]\n\u039b\u03bf\u03c5\u03ba\u03b9\u03ac\u03bd\u03bf\u03c2 \u039a\u03b7\u03bb\u03b1\u03b7\u03b4\u03cc\u03bd\u03b7\u03c2\n|1992\n|}\n\n==See also==\n* [[Evzones]]\n* [[Greek National Awakening]]\n* [[Morea expedition|Morea Expedition (1828-1833)]]\n* [[Phoenix (currency)]]\n* [[Propylaea (Munich)]]\n\n==Notes==\n{{Refbegin}}\n{{Cnote|i|Adanir refers to the \"mountainous districts such as [[Mani peninsula|Mani]] in the Peloponnese or [[Souliotes|Souli]] and [[Himara]] in Epirus, which had never been completely subjugated\".<ref>Adanir, \"Semi-autonomous Forces\", pp. 159\u2013160</ref>}}\n{{Cnote|ii|Re\u02bf\u00e2y\u00e2.

The revolution is celebrated in [[Greece]] and by Greeks around the world as [[Greek Independence Day|independence day]] on 25 March.\n\n[[Greece]] came under Ottoman rule in the 15th century, in the decades before and after the [[fall of Constantinople]].<ref>{{cite book|first =Caroline |last=Finkel|title =Osman's Dream: The History of the Ottoman Empire|isbn = 9780465008506|date = 2007|publisher = Basic Books |page = 17|url = https://books.google.com/books?id=9cTHyUQoTyUC&lpg=PP1&pg=PA17}}</ref> During the following centuries, there were sporadic but unsuccessful [[Ottoman Greece#Uprisings before 1821|Greek uprisings]] against Ottoman rule.<ref>Woodhouse, ''A Story of Modern Greece'', 'The Dark Age of Greece (1453\u20131800)', p. 113, Faber and Faber (1968)</ref> In 1814, a secret organization called [[Filiki Eteria]] (Society of Friends) was founded with the aim of liberating Greece, encouraged by the revolutionary fervor gripping Europe in that period. The Filiki Eteria planned to launch revolts in the [[Peloponnese]], the [[Danubian Principalities]], and [[Constantinople]] itself. The insurrection was planned for 25 March 1821 (on the Julian Calendar), the Orthodox Christian [[Feast of the Annunciation]]. However, the plans of Filiki Eteria were discovered by the Ottoman authorities, forcing the revolution to start earlier. The first revolt began on 6 March/21 February 1821 in the [[Danubian Principalities]], but it was soon put down by the Ottomans. The events in the north urged the Greeks in the Peloponnese ([[Morea]]) into action and on 17 March 1821, the [[Maniots]] were first to declare war. In September 1821, the Greeks under the leadership of [[Theodoros Kolokotronis]] captured [[Tripoli, Greece|Tripolitsa]]. Revolts in [[Crete]], [[Macedonia (Greece)|Macedonia]], and [[Central Greece]] broke out, but were eventually suppressed. Meanwhile, makeshift Greek fleets achieved success against the [[Ottoman Navy|Ottoman navy]] in the [[Aegean Sea]] and prevented Ottoman reinforcements from arriving by sea.\n\nTensions soon developed among different Greek factions, leading to two consecutive civil wars. The [[Ottoman Sultan]] called in his vassal [[Muhammad Ali of Egypt]], who agreed to send his son [[Ibrahim Pasha of Egypt|Ibrahim Pasha]] to Greece with an army to suppress the revolt in return for territorial gains. Ibrahim landed in the Peloponnese in February 1825 and brought most of the peninsula under Egyptian control by the end of that year. The town of [[Missolonghi]] fell in April 1826 after a [[Third Siege of Missolonghi|year-long siege]] by the Turks. Despite a [[Ottoman\u2013Egyptian invasion of Mani|failed invasion of Mani]], Athens also fell and the revolution looked all but lost.\n\nAt that point, the three Great Powers\u2014Russia, Britain and France\u2014decided to intervene, sending their naval squadrons to Greece in 1827. Following news that the combined Ottoman\u2013Egyptian fleet was going to attack the island of [[Hydra, Saronic Islands|Hydra]], the allied European fleets intercepted the Ottoman navy at [[Pylos|Navarino]]. After a tense week-long standoff, the [[Battle of Navarino]] led to the destruction of the Ottoman\u2013Egyptian fleet and turned the tide in favor of the revolutionaries. In 1828 the Egyptian army withdrew under pressure of a [[Morea expedition|French expeditionary force]]. The Ottoman garrisons in the Peloponnese surrendered, and the Greek revolutionaries proceeded to retake central Greece. Russia invaded the Ottoman Empire and forced it to accept Greek autonomy in the [[Treaty of Adrianople (1829)]]. After nine years of war, Greece was finally recognized as an independent state under the [[London Protocol (1830)|London Protocol]] of February 1830. Further negotiations in 1832 led to the [[London Conference of 1832|London Conference]] and the [[Treaty of Constantinople (1832)|Treaty of Constantinople]]; these defined the final borders of the new state and established [[Otto of Greece|Prince Otto]] of Bavaria as the first king of Greece.\n\n==Background==\n{{Details|Background of the Greek War of Independence}}\n\n===Ottoman rule===\n{{See also|Ottoman Greece}}\nThe [[Fall of Constantinople]] on 29&nbsp;May 1453 and the subsequent fall of the successor states of the [[Byzantine Empire]] marked the end of Byzantine sovereignty.

Throughout the 17th century there was great resistance to the [[Ottoman Turks|Ottomans]] in the [[Morea]] and elsewhere, as evidenced by revolts led by [[Dionysius the Philosopher]].<ref name=\"Kassis29\">Kassis, ''Mani's History'', p. 29.</ref> After the [[Morean War]], the [[Peloponnese]] came under [[Republic of Venice|Venetian]] rule for 30 years, and remained in turmoil from then on and throughout the 17th century, as the bands of [[klepht]]s multiplied.<ref name=\"Kassis31-33\">Kassis, ''Mani's History'', pp. 31\u201333.</ref>\n\nThe first great uprising was the Russian-sponsored [[Orlov Revolt]] of the 1770s, which was crushed by the Ottomans after having limited success.

Greeks controlled the affairs of the Orthodox Church through the [[Ecumenical Patriarchate of Constantinople]], as the higher clergy of the Orthodox Church was mostly of Greek origin. Thus, as a result of the Ottoman [[Millet (Ottoman Empire)|millet system]], the predominantly Greek hierarchy of the Patriarchate enjoyed control over the Empire's Orthodox subjects (the ''Rum milleti''<ref name=\"Arnakis, p. 238\">Georgiadis\u2013Arnakis, ''The Greek Church of Constantinople'', p. 238</ref>).<ref name=\"B118\" />\n\nThe [[Greek Orthodox Church]] played a pivotal role in the preservation of national identity, the development of Greek society and the resurgence of Greek nationalism.{{cref|iii}} From the early 18th century and onwards, members of prominent Greek families in Constantinople, known as [[Phanariotes]] (after the [[Fener|Phanar]] district of the city) gained considerable control over Ottoman foreign policy and eventually over the bureaucracy as a whole.<ref>Paparrigopoulos, ''History of the Hellenic Nation'', Eb, p. 108<br />* Svoronos, ''The Greek Nation'', p. 89<br />* Trudgill, \"Greece and European Turkey\", p. 241</ref>\n\n====Klephts and armatoloi====\n[[File:BoningtonArmatolos.jpg|thumb|upright|Portrait of a Greek armatolos by [[Richard Parkes Bonington]] (oil painting, 1825\u20131826, Benaki Museum)]]\n\nIn times of militarily weak central authority, the Balkan countryside became infested by groups of bandits called \"[[klepht]]s\" ({{lang-el|\u03ba\u03bb\u03ad\u03c6\u03c4\u03b5\u03c2}}) (the Greek equivalent of the [[hajduk]]s) that struck at Muslims and Christians alike.

[[Peter the Great]] had envisaged a disintegration of the Ottoman Empire and the re-institution of a new Byzantine Empire with an Orthodox emperor. His [[Pruth River Campaign]] of 1711 set a precedent for the Greeks, when Peter appealed to Orthodox Christians to join the Russians and rise against the Turks to fight for \"''faith and homeland''\".  The Russo-Turkish wars of Catherine II (1762-1796) made the Greeks  consider their emancipation with the aid of Russia. An independence movement in Peloponnesus (Morea) was incited by Russian agents in 1769, and a Greek flotilla under Lambros Katsonis assisted the Russian fleet in the war of 1788\u20131792.<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=YwbHCQAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_ge_summary_r&cad=0#v=onepage&q&f=false Lucien J.

Korais' primary intellectual inspiration was from the Enlightenment, and he borrowed ideas from Thomas Hobbes, John Locke and Jean-Jacques Rousseau. When Korais was a young adult he moved to Paris to continue his studies. He eventually graduated from the Montpellier School of Medicine and spent the remainder of his life in Paris. He would often have political and philosophical debates with Thomas Jefferson. While in Paris he was a witness to the French Revolution and saw the democracy that came out of it.

Byron's death helped to create an even stronger European sympathy for the Greek cause.

Fearing that his followers might surrender him to the Turks, he gave out that Austria had declared war on Turkey, caused a [[Te Deum]] to be sung in [[Cozia Monastery]], and on pretext of arranging measures with the Austrian commander-in-chief, he crossed the frontier. However, the reactionary policies of the [[Holy Alliance]] were enforced by [[Francis II, Holy Roman Emperor|Francis II]] and the country refused to give asylum for leaders of revolts in neighboring countries.

There, [[Papaflessas]], a pro-revolution priest who presented himself as representative of [[Filiki Eteria]] clashed with most of the civil leaders and members of the senior clergy, such as [[Germanos III of Old Patras|Metropolitan Germanos of Patras]], who were sceptical and demanded guarantees about a Russian intervention.<ref>Papageorgiou, \"First Year of Freedom\", p. 59.</ref>\n\n[[File:Anagnostaras by Hess.jpg|thumb|left|170px|''[[Anagnostis Papageorgiou|Anagnostaras]] during the [[Battle of Valtetsi]]'' by Peter von Hess.]]\n\nAs news came of Ypsilantis' march into the Danubian Principalities, the atmosphere in the Peloponnese was tense, and by mid-March, sporadic incidents against Muslims occurred, heralding the start of the uprising.

The ideals and patriotic songs of Rigas Feraios and others had made a profound impression upon the Thessalonians. \u0391 few years later, the revolutionary fervour of the southern Greeks was to spread to these parts, and the seeds of Filiki Eteria were speedily to take root. The leader and coordinator of the revolution in Macedonia was [[Emmanouel Pappas]] from the village of [[Emmanouil Pappas|Dobista]], [[Serres (regional unit)|Serres]], who was initiated into the Filiki Eteria in 1819. Pappas had considerable influence over the local Ottoman authorities, especially the local governor, Ismail Bey, and offered much of his personal wealth for the cause.<ref>Vacalopoulos, ''History of Macedonia''</ref>\n\nFollowing the instructions of Alexander Ypsilantis, that is to prepare the ground and to rouse the inhabitants of Macedonia to rebellion, Pappas loaded arms and munitions from Constantinople on a ship on 23 March and proceeded to [[Mount Athos]], considering that this would be the most suitable spring-board for starting the insurrection. As Vacalopoulos notes, however, \"adequate preparations for rebellion had not been made, nor were revolutionary ideals to be reconciled with the ideological world of the monks within the Athonite regime\".<ref>Vacalopoulos, ''History of Macedonia'', p.592</ref> On 8 May, the Turks, infuriated by the landing of sailors from [[Psara]] at [[Stomio, Larissa|Tsayezi]], by the capture of Turkish merchants and the seizure of their goods, rampaged through the streets of Serres, searched the houses of the notables for arms, imprisoned the Metropolitan and 150 merchants, and seized their goods as a reprisal for the plundering by the Psarians.<ref>Vacalopoulos, ''History of Macedonia'', pp.&nbsp;594\u2013595</ref>\n\nIn Thessaloniki, governor Yusuf Bey (the son of Ismail Bey) imprisoned in his headquarters more than 400 hostages, of whom more than 100 were monks from the monastic estates. He also wished to seize the powerful notables of [[Polygyros]], who got wind of his intentions and fled. On 17 May, the Greeks of Polygyros took up arms, killed the local governor and 14 of his men, and wounded three others; they also repulsed two Turkish detachments. On 18 May, when Yusuf learned of the incidents at Polygyros and the spreading of the insurrection to the villages of [[Chalkidiki]], he ordered half of his hostages to be slaughtered before his eyes. The Mulla of Thessalonica, Hayr\u0131\u00fclah, gives the following description of Yusuf's retaliations:\n{{quote|Every day and every night you hear nothing in the streets of Thessaloniki but shouting and moaning.

In June 1821 the insurgents tried to cut communications between [[Thrace]] and the south, attempting to prevent the ''[[serasker]]'' Haji Muhammad Bayram Pasha from transferring forces from Asia Minor to southern Greece. Even though the rebels delayed him, they were ultimately defeated at the pass of [[Rentina, Thessaloniki|Rentina]].<ref>Vacalopoulos, ''History of Macedonia'', p.609</ref>\n\nThe insurrection in Chalkidiki was, from then on, confined to the peninsulas of Mount Athos and Kassandra. On 30 October 1821, an offensive led by the new Pasha of Thessaloniki, Muhammad Emin Abulubud, resulted in a decisive Ottoman victory at Kassandra. The survivors, among them Pappas, were rescued by the Psarian fleet, which took them mainly to [[Skiathos]], [[Skopelos]] and [[Skyros]]. However, Pappas died en route to join the revolution at [[Hydra, Saronic Islands|Hydra]]. [[Sithonia]], Mount Athos and Thasos subsequently surrendered on terms.<ref>Vacalopoulos, ''History of Macedonia'', pp.&nbsp;615\u2013619</ref>\n\nNevertheless, the revolt spread from [[central Macedonia|Central]] to [[Western Macedonia]], from [[Mount Olympus|Olympus]] to [[Pieria (regional unit)|Pieria]] and [[Vermion Mountains|Vermion]]. In the autumn of 1821, Nikolaos Kasomoulis was sent to southern Greece as the \"representative of South-East Macedonia\", and met Demetrius Ypsilantis. He then wrote to Papas from Hydra, asking him to visit Olympus to meet the captains there and to \"fire them with the required patriotic enthusiasm\".<ref>Vacalopoulos, ''History of Macedonia'', pp.&nbsp;627\u2013628</ref> At the beginning of 1822, [[Anastasios Karatasos]] and [[Aggelis Gatsos]] arranged a meeting with other ''armatoloi''; they decided that the insurrection should be based on three towns: [[Naousa, Imathia|Naoussa]], [[Kastania (Pieria), Greece|Kastania]], and [[Siatista]].<ref>Vacalopoulos, ''History of Macedonia'', pp.&nbsp;628\u2013629</ref>\n\nIn March 1822, Mehmed Emin secured decisive victories at [[Kolindros]] and Kastania.<ref>Vacalopoulos, ''History of Macedonia'', pp.&nbsp;633\u2013636</ref> Further north, in the vicinity of Naousa, [[Zafeirakis Theodosiou]], Karatasos and Gatsos organized the city's defense, and the first clashes resulted in a victory for the Greeks.

Failing to get the insurgents to surrender, Mehmed Emin launched a number of attacks pushing them further back and finally captured Naousa in April, helped by the enemies of Zafeirakis, who had revealed an unguarded spot, the \"Alonia\".<ref>Vacalopoulos, ''History of Macedonia'', pp.&nbsp;635\u2013637</ref> Reprisals and executions ensued, and women are reported to have flung themselves over the Arapitsa waterfall to avoid dishonor and being sold in slavery.

They landed at Asprovrisi of Lapithou. Kanaris brought with him papers from the Filiki Etaireia and the ships were welcomed with rapturous applause and patriotic cries from the local Greeks of the area, who helped Kanaris and the soldiers from Cyprus as much as they could.\n\nKanaris brought with him to mainland  Greece, Cypriots who created the \"Column of Cypriots\" (\u00ab\u03a6\u03ac\u03bb\u03b1\u03b3\u03b3\u03b1 \u03c4\u03c9\u03bd \u039a\u03c5\u03c0\u03c1\u03af\u03c9\u03bd\u00bb), led by General Chatzipetros, which fought with extraordinary heroism in Greece. In total, over 1000 Cypriots fought in the War of Independence, many of whom died. At Missolonghi many were killed, and at the Battle of Athens in 1827, around 130 were killed. General Chatzipetros, showing military decorations declared \"These were given to me by the heroism and braveness of the Column of Cypriots\". In the National Library, there is a list of 580 names of Cypriots who fought in the War between 1821 and 1829.\n\nThe Cypriot battalion brought with them their own distinctive war banner, consisting of a white flag with a large blue cross, and the words ''GREEK FLAG OF THE MOTHERLAND CYPRUS'' emblazoned in the top left corner. The flag was hoisted on a wooden mast, carved and pointed at the end to act as a lance in battle. The legendary battle flag is currently stored at the National Historical Museum of Athens.\n\n[[File:\u0391\u03c1\u03c7\u03b9\u03b5\u03c0\u03af\u03c3\u03ba\u03bf\u03c0\u03bf\u03c2 \u039a\u03cd\u03c0\u03c1\u03bf\u03c5 \u039a\u03c5\u03c0\u03c1\u03b9\u03b1\u03bd\u03cc\u03c2.jpg|left|thumb|180px|Painting of the Archbishop [[Kyprianos of Cyprus]]]]\n\nThroughout the War of Independence, supplies were brought from Cyprus by the Filiki Etairia to aid the Greek struggle. The Greeks of Cyprus underwent great risk to provide these supplies, and secretly load them onto boats arriving at intervals from Greece, as the Ottoman rulers in Cyprus at the time were very wary of Cypriot insurgency and sentenced to death any Greek Cypriots found aiding the Greek cause. Incidences of these secret loading trips from Cyprus were recorded by the French consul to Cyprus, Mechain.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.synexelixi.org/el/component/content/article/60-kypros-1821 |title=Archived copy |access-date=22 June 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120325235958/http://www.synexelixi.org/el/component/content/article/60-kypros-1821 |archive-date=25 March 2012 |url-status=dead |df=dmy-all }}</ref>\n\nBack in Cyprus during the war, the local population suffered greatly at the hands of the Ottoman rulers of the islands, who were quick to act with great severity at any act of patriotism and sympathy of the Greeks of Cyprus to the Revolution, fearing a similar uprising in Cyprus. The religious leader of the Greeks of the island at the time, [[Archbishop Kyprianos]] was initiated into the Filiki Etairia in 1818 and had promised to aid the cause of the Greek Helladites with food and money.\n\nIn early July 1821, the Cypriot Archimandrite Theofylaktos Thiseas arrived in [[Larnaca]] as a messenger of the Filiki Etairia, bringing orders to Kyprianos, while proclamations were distributed in every corner of the island. However, the local pasha, K\u00fc\u00e7\u00fck Pasha, intercepted these messages and reacted with fury, calling in reinforcements, confiscating weapons and arresting several prominent Cypriots. Archbishop Kyprianos was urged (by his friends) to leave the island as the situation worsened, but refused to do so.\n\nOn 9 July 1821 K\u00fc\u00e7\u00fck Pasha had the gates to the walled city of Nicosia closed and executed, by beheading or hanging, 470 important Cypriots amongst them Chrysanthos (bishop of Paphos), Meletios (bishop of Kition) and Lavrentios (bishop of Kyrenia). The next day, all abbots and monks of monasteries in Cyprus were executed. In addition, the Ottomans arrested all the Greek leaders of the villages and imprisoned them before executing them, as they were suspected of inspiring patriotism in their local population.\n\nIn total, it is estimated that over 2,000 Greeks of Cyprus were slaughtered as an act of revenge for participating in the revolution. This was a very significant proportion of the total population of the island at the time. K\u00fc\u00e7\u00fck pasha had declared ''\"I have in my mind to slaughter the Greeks in Cyprus, to hang them, to not leave a soul...\"'' before undertaking these massacres. From 9 to 14 July, the Ottomans killed all prisoners on the list of the pasha, and in the next 30 days, looting and massacres spread throughout Cyprus as 4,000 Turkish soldiers from Syria arrived on the island.\n\nArchbishop Kyprianos was defiant in his death. He was aware of his fate and impending death, yet stood by the Greek cause. He is revered throughout Cyprus as a noble patriot and defender of the Orthodox faith and Hellenic cause. An English explorer by the name of Carne spoke to the Archbishop before the events of 9 July, who was quoted as saying: \"My death is not far away. I know they [the Ottoman] are waiting for an opportunity to kill me\". Kyprianos chose to stay, despite these fears, and provide protection and counsel for the people of Cyprus as their leader.\n\nHe was publicly hanged from a tree opposite the former palace of the Lusignan Kings of Cyprus on 19 July 1821. The events leading up to his execution were documented in an epic poem written in the Cypriot dialect by [[Vassilis Michaelides]].\n\n===War at sea===\n[[File:Aris figurehead of Tsamadoy ship.jpg|thumb|upright|left|The [[figurehead]] of [[Anastasios Tsamados]]\u2019 famous brig [[Greek brig Aris|Aris]], today in the [[National Historical Museum, Athens]].]]\n\nFrom the early stages of the revolution, success at sea was vital for the Greeks. When they failed to counter the [[Ottoman Navy]], it was able to resupply the isolated Ottoman garrisons and land reinforcements from the [[Ottoman Empire]]'s provinces, theatening to crush the rebellion; likewise the failure of the Greek fleet to break the naval blocade of Missolonghi (as it did several times earlier) in 1826 led to the fall of the city.\n\nThe Greek fleet was primarily outfitted by prosperous Aegean islanders, principally from three islands: [[Hydra, Saronic Islands|Hydra]], [[Spetses]] and [[Psara]]. Each island equipped, manned and maintained its own squadron, under its own admiral.<ref name=\"Brewer, pp. 89\u201391\">Brewer, pp. 89\u201391.</ref> Although they were manned by experienced crews, the Greek ships were not designed for warfare, equipped with only light guns and staffed by armed merchantmen.<ref name=\"Brewer, pp. 89\u201391\"/> Against them stood the Ottoman fleet, which enjoyed several advantages: its ships and supporting craft were built for war; it was supported by the resources of the vast Ottoman Empire; command was centralized and disciplined under the [[Kapudan Pasha]]. The total Ottoman fleet size consisted of 20 three-masted [[ship of the line|ships of the line]], each with about 80 guns and 7 or 8 [[frigate]]s with 50 guns, 5 corvettes with about 30 guns and around 40 [[brig]]s with 20 or fewer guns.<ref>Brewer, pp. 91\u201392.</ref>\n\n[[File:\u039a\u03c9\u03bd\u03c3\u03c4\u03b1\u03bd\u03c4\u03af\u03bd\u03bf\u03c2 \u0392\u03bf\u03bb\u03b1\u03bd\u03ac\u03ba\u03b7\u03c2 - \u03a4\u03bf \u03ba\u03ac\u03c8\u03b9\u03bc\u03bf \u03c4\u03b7\u03c2 \u03c4\u03bf\u03c5\u03c1\u03ba\u03b9\u03ba\u03ae\u03c2 \u03c6\u03c1\u03b5\u03b3\u03ac\u03c4\u03b1\u03c2.jpg|thumb|240px|\"The burning of the Ottoman frigate at Eressos by [[Dimitrios Papanikolis]]\" by [[Konstantinos Volanakis]]]]\n\nIn the face of this situation, the Greeks decided to use [[fire ship]]s ({{lang-el|\u03c0\u03c5\u03c1\u03c0\u03bf\u03bb\u03b9\u03ba\u03ac or \u03bc\u03c0\u03bf\u03c5\u03c1\u03bb\u03cc\u03c4\u03b1}}), which had proven themselves effective for the Psarians during the [[Orlov Revolt]] in 1770. The first test was made at [[Eresos]] on 27 May 1821, when an Ottoman frigate was successfully destroyed by a fire ship under [[Dimitrios Papanikolis]]. In the fire ships, the Greeks found an effective weapon against the Ottoman vessels. In subsequent years, the successes of the Greek fire ships would increase their reputation, with acts such as the destruction of the Ottoman flagship by [[Constantine Kanaris]] at [[Chios]], after the [[Chios Massacre|massacre of the island's population in June 1822]], acquiring international fame. {{citation needed span|Overall, 59 fire ship attacks were carried out, of which 39 were successful.|date=August 2017}}\n\nAt the same time, conventional naval actions were also fought, at which naval commanders like [[Andreas Vokos Miaoulis|Andreas Miaoulis]] distinguished themselves. The early successes of the Greek fleet in direct confrontations with the Ottomans at Patras and Spetses gave the crews confidence and contributed greatly to the survival and success of the uprising in the Peloponnese.\n\nLater, however, as Greece became embroiled in a civil war, the Sultan called upon his strongest subject, [[Muhammad Ali of Egypt]], for aid. Plagued by internal strife and financial difficulties in keeping the fleet in constant readiness, the Greeks failed to prevent the capture and destruction of [[Kasos]] and [[Destruction of Psara|Psara]] in 1824, or the landing of the Egyptian army at [[Methoni, Messenia|Methoni]]. Despite victories at [[Samos Island|Samos]] and Gerontas, the Revolution was threatened with collapse until the intervention of the Great Powers in the [[Battle of Navarino]] in 1827.\n\n==1822\u20131824==\n[[File:Mavrokordatos by Hess.jpg|thumb|180px|\"[[Alexandros Mavrokordatos]], president of the Executive, defends Missolonghi\" (''[[First Siege of Missolonghi]]''), by [[Peter von Hess]].]]\n[[File:Dionysios Solomos - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|180px|[[Dionysios Solomos]] wrote in 1823 the ''[[Hymn to Liberty]]'', which later became the National Greek anthem.]]\n\nRevolutionary activity was fragmented because of the lack of strong central leadership and guidance.

The Assembly drafted the [[Greek Constitution of 1822|first Greek Constitution]] and appointed the members of an executive and a legislative body that were to govern the liberated territories. Mavrokordatos saved the office of president of the executive for himself, while Ypsilantis, who had called for the Assembly, was elected president of the legislative body, a place of limited significance.<ref>Dakin, ''The Greek Struggle for independence'', pp. 87\u20139.</ref>\n\nMilitary leaders and representatives of Filiki Eteria were marginalized, but gradually Kolokotronis' political influence grew, and he soon managed to control, along with the captains he influenced, the Peloponnesian Senate. The central administration tried to marginalize Kolokotronis, who also had under his control the fort of [[Nafplion]]. In November 1822, the central administration decided that the new National Assembly would take place in Nafplion, and asked Kolokotronis to return the fort to the government. Kolokotronis refused, and the Assembly was finally gathered in March 1823 in [[Astros, Greece|Astros]].

Kolokotronis accepted, but he caused a serious crisis when he prevented Mavrokordatos, who had been elected president of the legislative body, from assuming his position. His attitude towards Mavrokordatos caused outrage amongst the members of the legislative body.<ref>Rotzokos, \"Civil Wars\", 152\u2013154</ref>\n\nThe crisis culminated when the legislature, which was controlled by the Roumeliotes and the Hydriots, overturned the executive, and fired its president, Petros Mavromichalis. Kolokotronis and most of the Peloponnesian notables and captains supported Mavromichalis, who remained president of his executive in Tripolitsa. However, a second executive, supported by the islanders, the Roumeliotes, and some Achaean notables\u2014[[Andreas Zaimis]] and [[Andreas Londos]] were the most prominent\u2014was formed at [[Kranidi]] with [[Georgios Kountouriotis|Kountouriotis]] as president.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">Dimitropoulos, ''Theodoros Kolokotronis'', 79\u201381<br/>* Rotzokos, \"Civil Wars\", 154\u2013161</ref>\n\nIn March 1824, the forces of the new executive besieged Nafplion and Tripolitsa. After one month of fighting and negotiations, an agreement was reached between Kolokotronis, from one side, and Londos and Zaimis, from the other side. On 22 May, the first phase of the civil war officially ended, but most of the members of the new executive were displeased by the moderate terms of the agreement that Londos and Zaimis brokered.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/>\n\nDuring this period, the two first installments of the English loan had arrived, and the position of the government was strengthened; but the infighting was not yet over. Zaimis and the other Peloponnesians who supported Kountouriotis came into conflict with the executive body, and allied with Kolokotronis, who roused the residents of Tripolitsa against the local tax collectors of the government. Papaflessas and Makriyannis failed to suppress the rebellion, but Kolokotronis remained inactive for some period, overwhelmed by the death of his son, Panos.<ref name=\"ReferenceB\">Dimitropoulos, ''Theodoros Kolokotronis'', 79\u201381<br/>* Rotzokos, \"Civil Wars\", 164\u2013170.</ref>\n\nThe government regrouped its armies, which now consisted mainly of Roumeliotes and Souliotes, led by [[Ioannis Kolettis]], who wanted a complete victory. Under Kolettis' orders, two bodies of Roumeliotes and Souliotes invaded the Peloponnese: the first under Gouras occupied [[Corinth]] and raided the province; the second under Karaiskakis, [[Kitsos Tzavelas]] and others, attacked in Achaea, Lindos and \"Zaimis\". In January 1825, a Roumeliote force, led by Kolettis himself, arrested Kolokotronis, Deligiannis' family and others. In May 1825, under the pressure of the Egyptian intervention, those imprisoned were released and granted amnesty.<ref name=\"ReferenceB\"/>\n\n==Egypt intervenes to assist the Ottomans==\n{{See also|Third Siege of Missolonghi|Ottoman\u2013Egyptian Invasion of Mani}}\n[[File:Ibrahim-messolonghi.jpg|thumb|''Ibrahim attacks Missolonghi'' by Giuseppe Pietro Mazzola]]\n[[File:The sortie of Messologhi by Theodore Vryzakis.jpg|thumb|''The sortie of Missolonghi'' by [[Theodoros Vryzakis]] (1855, oil on canvas, [[National Gallery of Athens]]).]]\n\nOn 19 July 1824, the largest fleet seen in the Mediterranean since Napoleon invaded Egypt in 1798 set sail from Alexandria, consisting of 54 warships and 400 transports carrying 14,000 French-trained infantry, 2,000 cavalry and 500 artillerymen, with some 150 cannons.<ref>Brewer, David ''The Greek War of Independence'', London: Overlook Duckworth, 2011 pages 235-236.</ref> Egyptian intervention was initially limited to Crete and Cyprus.

By the end of June, Ibrahim had captured the city of [[Argos]] and was within striking distance of [[Nafplion]]. The city was saved by Makriyannis and Dimitrios Ypsilantis who successfully defended Miloi at the outskirts of Nafplion, making the mills outside the town a fortress causing damage to Ibrahim's far superior forces who were unable to take the position and eventually left for Tripolitsa. Makriyannis was wounded and was taken aboard by Europeans who were overseeing the battle. Among them was De Rigny, who had an argument with Makriyannis and advised him to quit his weak position but Makriyannis ignored him.<ref name=\"el.wikisource.org\"/> Commodore Gawen Hamilton of the [[Royal Navy]], placed his ships in a position which looked like he would assist in the defence of the city.<ref name=\"Howarth233189\"/>\n\n[[File:Karaiskakis landing at Phaleron.jpg|thumb|240px|\"[[Georgios Karaiskakis|Karaiskakis]] landing at Phaliro\" by [[Konstantinos Volanakis]]]]\n\nAt the same time, the Turkish armies in Central Greece were besieging the city of [[Missolonghi]] for the [[Third Siege of Missolonghi|third time]].

They recognized the degeneration of the [[Ottoman Empire]], but they did not know how to handle this situation (a problem known as the \"Eastern Question\"). Afraid of the complications the partition of the empire might raise, the British foreign minister [[Robert Stewart, Viscount Castlereagh|Viscount Castlereagh]], Austrian foreign minister Prince [[Prince Klemens Wenzel von Metternich|Metternich]], and the Tsar of Russia [[Alexander I of Russia|Alexander I]] shared the same view concerning the necessity of preserving the ''status quo'' and the peace of Europe. They also pleaded that they maintain the [[Concert of Europe]].\n\nMetternich also tried to undermine the Russian foreign minister, [[Ioannis Kapodistrias]], who was of Greek origin. Kapodistrias demanded that Alexander declare war on the Ottomans in order to liberate Greece and increase the greatness of Russia. Metternich persuaded Alexander that Kapodistrias was in league with the Italian [[Carbonari]] (an Italian revolutionary group), leading Alexander to disavow him. As a result of the Russian reaction to Alexander Ypsilantis, Kapodistrias resigned as foreign minister and moved to [[Switzerland]].<ref>Troyat, ''Alexander of Russia'', pp. 269\u2013270</ref>\n\nNevertheless, Alexander's position was ambivalent, since he regarded himself as the protector of the Orthodox Church, and his subjects were deeply moved by the hanging of the Patriarch. These factors explain why, after denouncing the Greek Revolution, Alexander dispatched an ultimatum to Constantinople on 27 July 1821, after the Greek massacres in the city and the hanging of the Patriarch.\n\nHowever, the danger of war passed temporarily, after Metternich and Castlereagh persuaded the Sultan to make some concessions to the Tsar.<ref>Stavrianos, ''The Balkans since 1453'', pp. 286\u2013288</ref> On 14 December 1822, the Holy Alliance denounced the Greek Revolution, considering it audacious.\n\n===Change of stance===\n{{multiple image\n| align = right\n| image1 = George Canning by Richard Evans.jpg\n| width1 = 175\n| alt1 = \n| caption1 = \n| image2 = Nicholasbotman(1).jpg\n| width2 = 210\n| alt2 = \n| caption2 = \n| footer = Left: [[George Canning]] was the architect of the [[Treaty of London (1827)|Treaty of London]], which launched European intervention in the Greek conflict.<br />Right:[[Tsar Nicholas I]] co-signed the Treaty of London, and then launched the [[Russo-Turkish War (1828\u20131829)|Russo-Turkish War]] of 1828\u20131829, which finally secured Greek independence.\n}}\n\nIn August 1822, [[George Canning]] was appointed by the British government as Foreign Secretary, succeeding Castlereagh. Canning was influenced by the mounting popular agitation against the Ottomans, and believed that a settlement could no longer be postponed. He also feared that Russia might undertake unilateral action against the Ottoman Empire.<ref>Stavrianos, ''The Balkans since 1453'', p. 288</ref>\n\nIn March 1823, Canning declared that \"when a whole nation revolts against its conqueror, the nation cannot be considered as piratical but as a nation in a state of war\". In February 1823 he notified the Ottoman Empire that Britain would maintain friendly relations with the Turks only under the condition that the latter respected the Christian subjects of the Empire. The Commissioner of the [[Ionian Islands]], which belonged to Britain, was ordered to consider the Greeks in a state of war and give them the right to cut off certain areas from which the Turks could get provisions.<ref name=\"Br52\" />\n\nThese measures led to the increase of British influence. This influence was reinforced by the issuing of two loans that the Greeks managed to conclude with British fund-holders in 1824 and 1825. These loans, which, in effect, made the City of London the financier of the revolution,<ref name=\"Br52\" /> inspired the creation of the \"British\" political party in Greece, whose opinion was that the revolution could only end in success with the help of Britain. At the same time, parties affiliated to Russia and France made their appearance.

The Sultan agreed to send the plenipotentiaries, and on 7 October 1826 signed the [[Akkerman Convention]], in which Russian demands concerning Serbia and the principalities were accepted.<ref>Stavrianos, ''The Balkans since 1453'', pp. 288\u2013289</ref>\n\nThe Greeks formally applied for the mediation provided in the Petersburg Protocol, while the Turks and the Egyptians showed no willingness to stop fighting.<ref>Brewer, David ''The Greek War of Independence The Struggle for Freedom from Ottoman Oppression'', London: Overlook Duckworth, 2011 page 316</ref> France, which initially backed its client Muhammad Ali the Great with weapons and officers to train his army, changed its stance, partly because of the pro-Greek feelings of the French people, and partly because King [[Charles X of France|Charles X]] saw the offer to impose mediation as a way of assuring French influence in Greece.<ref>Brewer, David ''The Greek War of Independence The Struggle for Freedom from Ottoman Oppression'', London: Overlook Duckworth, 2011 pages 316-317</ref> Since Britain and Russia were going to impose mediation with or without France, if the French declined the offer to impose mediation, Greece would be in the Anglo-Russian sphere of influence, while if the French did take part, then Greece would also be in the French sphere of influence.<ref>Brewer, David ''The Greek War of Independence The Struggle for Freedom from Ottoman Oppression'', London: Overlook Duckworth, 2011 page 317</ref> Canning therefore prepared for action by negotiating the [[Treaty of London (1827)|Treaty of London]] (6 July 1827) with France and Russia. This provided that the Allies should again offer negotiations, and if the Sultan rejected it, they would exert all the means which circumstances would allow to force the cessation of hostilities. Meanwhile, news reached Greece in late July 1827 that Muhammad Ali's new fleet was completed in [[Alexandria]] and sailing towards [[Pylos|Navarino]] to join the rest of the Egyptian-Turkish fleet. The aim of this fleet was to attack Hydra and knock the island's fleet out of the war. On 29 August, the Porte formally rejected the Treaty of London's stipulations, and, subsequently, the commanders-in-chief of the [[Mediterranean Fleet (United Kingdom)|British]] and [[Mediterranean Fleet (France)|French]] Mediterranean fleets, Admiral [[Edward Codrington]] and Admiral [[Henri de Rigny]], sailed into the Gulf of Argos and requested to meet with Greek representatives on board {{HMS|Asia|1824|6}}.<ref name=\"Howarth231\">Howarth, ''The Greek Adventure'', p. 231</ref>\n\n==== Battle of Navarino (1827)====\n{{Main|Battle of Navarino}}\n[[File:ModernEgypt, Muhammad Ali by Auguste Couder, BAP 17996.jpg|thumb|upright|Portrait of [[Muhammad Ali Pasha]] (by [[Auguste Couder]], 1841, [[Palace of Versailles]]), whose expedition to the Peloponnese precipitated European intervention in the Greek conflict.]]\n\nAfter the Greek delegation, led by Mavrocordatos, accepted the terms of the treaty, the Allies prepared to insist upon the armistice, and their fleets were instructed to intercept supplies destined for Ibrahim's forces. When Muhammad Ali's fleet, which had been warned by the British and French to stay away from Greece, left Alexandria and joined other Ottoman/Egyptian units at Navarino on 8 September, Codrington arrived with his squadron off Navarino on 12 September. On 13 October, Codrington was joined, off Navarino, by his allied support, a French squadron under De Rigny and a Russian squadron under [[Login Petrovich Geiden|Login Geiden]].<ref name=\"Howarth233-34\">Howarth, ''The Greek Adventure'', pp. 231\u201334.</ref>\n\nUpon their arrival at Navarino, Codgrinton and de Rigny tried to negotiate with Ibrahim, but Ibrahim insisted that by the Sultan's order he must destroy Hydra. Codrington responded by saying that if Ibrahim's fleets attempted to go anywhere but home, he would have to destroy them. Ibrahim agreed to write to the Sultan to see if he would change his orders, but he also complained about the Greeks being able to continue their attacks. Codrington promised that he would stop the Greeks and Philhellenes from attacking the Turks and Egyptians. After doing this, he disbanded most of his fleet, which returned to Malta, while the French went to the Aegean.<ref name=\"Howarth233-34\"/>\n\nHowever, when [[Frank Abney Hastings|Frank Hastings]], a [[Philhellenism|Philhellene]], destroyed a Turkish naval squadron during a [[Battle of Itea|raid off Itea]], Ibrahim sent a detachment of his fleet out of Navarino in order to defeat Hastings. Codrington had not heard of Hastings's actions and thought that Ibrahim was breaking his agreement. Codrington intercepted the force and made them retreat and did so again on the following day when Ibrahim led the fleet in person. Codrington assembled his fleet once more, with the British returning from Malta and the French from the Aegean. They were also joined by the Russian contingent led by Count Login Geiden. Ibrahim now began a campaign to annihilate the Greeks of the Peloponnese as he thought the Allies had reneged on their agreement.<ref name=\"Howarth236-37\">Howarth, ''The Greek Adventure'', pp. 236\u201337.</ref>\n\n[[File:Naval Battle of Navarino by Garneray.jpg|thumb|upright=1.4|left|''The Naval [[Battle of Navarino]]'' by [[Ambroise Louis Garneray]] (1827).]]\n\nOn 20 October 1827, as the weather got worse, the British, Russian and French fleets entered the Bay of Navarino in peaceful formation to shelter themselves and to make sure that the Egyptian-Turkish fleet did not slip off and attack Hydra. When a British [[frigate]] sent a boat to request the Egyptians to move their fire ships, the officer on board was shot by the Egyptians. The frigate responded with musket fire in retaliation and an Egyptian ship fired a cannon shot at the French flagship, the Sirene, which returned fire.<ref name=\"Howarth239\">Howarth, ''The Greek Adventure'', p. 239.</ref> A full engagement was begun which ended in a complete victory for the Allies and in the annihilation of the Egyptian-Turkish fleet.

The Porte demanded compensation from the Allies for the ships, but his demand was refused on the grounds that the Turks had acted as the aggressors. The three countries' ambassadors also left Constantinople.<ref name=\"Howarth241\">Howarth, ''The Greek Adventure'', p. 241.</ref>\n\nIn Britain, the battle was criticized as being an 'untoward event' towards Turkey, which was called an 'ancient ally'. Codrington was recalled and blamed for having allowed the retreating Egyptian-Turkish ships to carry 2,000 Greek slaves. In France, the news of the battle was greeted with great enthusiasm and the government had an unexpected surge in popularity. Russia formally took the opportunity to declare war on the Turks (April 1828).<ref name=\"Howarth241\"/>\n[[File:Entrevue du g\u00e9n\u00e9ral Maison et d'Ibrahim Pacha, \u00e0 Navarin, septembre 1828.jpg|thumb|310x310px|''[[Nicolas Joseph Maison|General Maison]] meeting [[Ibrahim Pasha of Egypt|Ibrahim Pasha]] in [[Pylos|Navarino]] in September 1828'' (by [[Jean-Charles Langlois]],1838, [[Palace of Versailles]]).]]\n\nIn October 1828, the Greeks regrouped and formed a new government under [[Ioannis Kapodistrias|Kapodistrias]]. Kapodistrias took advantage of the Russo-Turkish war and sent troops of the reorganised [[Hellenic Army]] to [[Central Greece]]. They advanced to seize as much territory as possible, including [[Athens]] and [[Thebes (Greece)|Thebes]], before the Western powers imposed a ceasefire. These Greek victories were proved decisive for the including of more territories in the future State. As far as the Peloponnese was concerned, Britain and Russia accepted the offer of France to send an army to expel Ibrahim's forces. [[Nicolas Joseph Maison]], who was given command of a [[Morea expedition|French expeditionary Corps]] of 15,000 men, landed on 30 August 1828 at [[Petalidi]] and helped the Greeks evacuate the Peloponnese from all the hostile troops by 30 October.

Greek forces under Demetrius Ypsilantis, for the first time trained to fight as a regular European army rather than as guerrilla bands, advanced against Aslan Bey's forces and defeated them. The Turks surrendered all lands from [[Livadeia]] to the [[Spercheios River]] in exchange for safe passage out of [[Central Greece]].

[[Henry John Temple, 3rd Viscount Palmerston|Lord Palmerston]], who took over as British Foreign Secretary, agreed to the Arta\u2013Volos borderline. However, the secret note on Crete, which the Bavarian plenipotentiary communicated to Britain, France and Russia, bore no fruit.\n\nIn May&nbsp;1832, Palmerston convened the [[London Conference of 1832|London Conference]]. The three Great Powers, Britain, [[July Monarchy|France]] and Russia, offered the throne to the [[Kingdom of Bavaria|Bavarian]] prince, [[Otto of Greece|Otto of Wittelsbach]]; meanwhile, the [[Fifth National Assembly at Nafplion]] had approved the choice of Otto, and passed the Constitution of 1832 (which would come to be known as the \"Hegemonic Constitution\"). As co-guarantors of the monarchy, the Great Powers also agreed to guarantee a loan of 60&nbsp;million&nbsp;francs to the new king, empowering their ambassadors in the Ottoman capital to secure the end of the war. Under the protocol signed on May&nbsp;7, 1832 between Bavaria and the protecting powers, Greece was defined as a \"monarchical and independent state\" but was to pay an indemnity to the Porte.

Many Jews around Greece and throughout Europe were supporters of the Greek revolt, using their resources to loan substantial amounts to the newly formed Greek government. In turn, the success of the Greek Revolution was to stimulate the incipient stirrings of Jewish nationalism, later called [[Zionism]].<ref name=\"Rivlin\">Bowman, \"The Jews of Greece\", [http://www.umass.edu/judaic/anniversaryvolume/articles/30-F3-Bowman.pdf 421\u2013422] (PDF)</ref>\n\n==Aftermath==\n[[File:Theodoros Vryzakis, Grateful Hellas (1858).jpg|thumb|left|upright|\"Grateful Hellas\" by [[Theodoros Vryzakis]]]]\n\nThe consequences of the Greek revolution were somewhat ambiguous in the immediate aftermath. An independent Greek state had been established, but with Britain, Russia and France claiming a major role in Greek politics, an imported Bavarian dynast as ruler, and a mercenary army.<ref name=\"Jelavich229-34\">Jelavich, ''History of the Balkans'', pp.&nbsp;229\u201334.</ref> The country had been ravaged by ten years of fighting and was full of displaced refugees and empty Turkish estates, necessitating a series of land reforms over several decades.<ref name=\"Sowards\"/>\n\nThe population of the new state numbered 800,000, representing less than one-third of the 2.5&nbsp;million Greek inhabitants of the Ottoman Empire. During a great part of the next century, the Greek state sought the liberation of the \"[[irredentism|unredeemed]]\" Greeks of the Ottoman Empire, in accordance with the [[Megali Idea]], i.e., the goal of uniting all Greeks in one country.<ref name=\"Sowards\"/>\n\nAs a people, the Greeks no longer provided the princes for the Danubian Principalities, and were regarded within the Ottoman Empire, especially by the Muslim population, as traitors. [[Phanariotes]], who had until then held high office within the Ottoman Empire, were thenceforth regarded as suspect, and lost their special, privileged status. In Constantinople and the rest of the Ottoman Empire where Greek banking and merchant presence had been dominant, Armenians mostly replaced Greeks in banking, and Jewish merchants gained importance.<ref name=\"Jelavich229\">Jelavich, ''History of the Balkans'', p. 229</ref>\n\n{| class=\"toccolours\" style=\"float: right; margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 2em; font-size: 85%; background:#c6dbf7; color:black; width:30em; max-width: 40%;\" cellspacing=\"5\"\n| style=\"text-align: left;\" | \"Today the fatherland is reborn, that for so long was lost and extinguished.

For the first time, a Christian subject people had achieved independence from Ottoman rule and established a fully independent state, recognized by Europe. Whereas previously, only large nations (such as the British or the French) were judged worthy of national self-determination by the Great Powers of Europe, the Greek Revolt legitimized the concept of small, ethnically-based nation-states, and emboldened nationalist movements among other subject peoples of the Ottoman Empire. The [[Serbs]], [[Bulgarians]], [[Albanians]], [[Romanians]] and [[Armenians]] all subsequently fought for and won their independence.\n\nShortly after the war ended, the people of the Russian-dependent [[Congress Poland|Poland]], encouraged by the Greek victory, started the [[November Uprising]], hoping to regain their independence.

[[Rigas Feraios]] (1757 \u2013 1798) was a very prominent poet and intellectual of Greek independence. Many of his poems urged the people of Greece to leave the cities, head to the mountains where they would have more freedom, and unite to gain their independence.\n\n[[Dionysios Solomos]] (1798 \u2013 1857) was another national poet inspired by the Greek War of Independence. Solomos wrote the [[Hymn to Liberty]] in 1823, two years after the Greeks started the war against the [[Ottoman Empire]]. The Hymn is 158 stanzas, making it one of the longest [[National Anthem]]s; however, officially, only the first two were adopted and sung. Not only is it the Greek anthem but also [[Cyprus]] adopted it as their own in 1966.\n\nTo this day, many songs are sung by Greeks worldwide on March 25 to [[Celebration of the Greek Revolution|celebrate their liberation]] and showcase their respect to the lives that were lost during the four hundred years Ottoman rule.\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+Music inspired by the Greek War of Independence\n!Song Name\n!Sung by\n!Released\n|-\n|'''Na'tane To 21'''\n\u039d\u03b1'\u03c4\u03b1\u03bd\u03b5 \u03a4\u03bf 21\n|[[George Dalaras]]\n\u0393\u03b9\u03ce\u03c1\u03b3\u03bf\u03c2 \u039d\u03c4\u03b1\u03bb\u03ac\u03c1\u03b1\u03c2\n|1970\n|-\n|'''O Thourios Tou Riga'''\n\u039f \u0398\u03bf\u03cd\u03c1\u03b9\u03bf\u03c2 \u03a4\u03bf\u03c5 \u03a1\u03ae\u03b3\u03b1\n|[[Nikos Xilouris]]\n\u039d\u03af\u03ba\u03bf\u03c2 \u039e\u03c5\u03bb\u03bf\u03cd\u03c1\u03b7\u03c2\n|1797 (the poem)\n|-\n|'''Ola Ta Ethni Polemoun'''\n'\u039f\u03bb\u03b1 \u03a4\u03b1 \u0388\u03b8\u03bd\u03b7 \u03c0\u03bf\u03bb\u03b5\u03bc\u03bf\u03cd\u03bd\n|Rigas Feraios & Christos Leontis\n\n\u03a1\u03ae\u03b3\u03b1\u03c2 \u03a6\u03b5\u03c1\u03b1\u03b9\u03cc\u03c2 & \u03a7\u03c1\u03ae\u03c3\u03c4\u03bf\u03c2 \u039b\u03b5\u03bf\u03bd\u03c4\u03ae\u03c2\n|N/A\n|-\n|'''Saranta Palikaria'''\n\u03a3\u03b1\u03c1\u03ac\u03bd\u03c4\u03b1 \u03a0\u03b1\u03bb\u03b9\u03ba\u03ac\u03c1\u03b9\u03b1\n|[[Stelios Kazantzidis]]\n\u03a3\u03c4\u03ad\u03bb\u03b9\u03bf\u03c2 \u039a\u03b1\u03b6\u03b1\u03bd\u03c4\u03b6\u03af\u03b4\u03b7\u03c2\n|N/A\n|-\n|'''Perifanoi Oloi'''\n\u03a0\u03b5\u03c1\u03ae\u03c6\u03b1\u03bd\u03bf\u03b9 \u0384\u039f\u03bb\u03bf\u03b9\n|Paschalis Arvanitidis\n\u03a0\u03b1\u03c3\u03c7\u03ac\u03bb\u03b7\u03c2 \u0391\u03c1\u03b2\u03b1\u03bd\u03b9\u03c4\u03af\u03b4\u03b7\u03c2\n|1967\n|-\n|'''Kleftiki Zoi'''\n\u039a\u03bb\u03ad\u03c6\u03c4\u03b9\u03ba\u03b7 \u0396\u03c9\u03ae\n|[[Loukianos Kilaidonis]]\n\u039b\u03bf\u03c5\u03ba\u03b9\u03ac\u03bd\u03bf\u03c2 \u039a\u03b7\u03bb\u03b1\u03b7\u03b4\u03cc\u03bd\u03b7\u03c2\n|1992\n|}\n\n==See also==\n* [[Evzones]]\n* [[Greek National Awakening]]\n* [[Morea expedition|Morea Expedition (1828-1833)]]\n* [[Phoenix (currency)]]\n* [[Propylaea (Munich)]]\n\n==Notes==\n{{Refbegin}}\n{{Cnote|i|Adanir refers to the \"mountainous districts such as [[Mani peninsula|Mani]] in the Peloponnese or [[Souliotes|Souli]] and [[Himara]] in Epirus, which had never been completely subjugated\".<ref>Adanir, \"Semi-autonomous Forces\", pp. 159\u2013160</ref>}}\n{{Cnote|ii|Re\u02bf\u00e2y\u00e2.
