The film explores themes of human relationships and [[mental illness]]. A mix of sex and suspense, the movie opened to controversy over its content and to negative reviews.\n\n==Plot==\nBobby Grady ([[John Laughlin (actor)|John Laughlin]]) is an ordinary [[middle-class]] electronics store owner who occasionally [[wiktionary:moonlighting|moonlight]]s doing [[surveillance]] work. He attends a [[group psychotherapy|group therapy]] session because his wife, Amy ([[Annie Potts]]), has lost interest in sex and he fears their marriage is in trouble.\n\nGrady is soon approached by the owner of a [[fashion design]] house to spy on an employee, Joanna Crane ([[Kathleen Turner]]), who is suspected of selling clothing patterns to his competitors. Grady discovers the accusations are unfounded, but also finds out that Joanna is moonlighting as a [[prostitute]] using the name China Blue, and shedding her business attire for provocative clothing and a platinum wig.\n\nGrady keeps quiet about Joanna's double life. After having an erotic encounter with her in her China Blue [[persona]], Grady begins seeing her on a regular basis, first professionally, then romantically. However, their involvement is complicated by his guilt and her intimacy issues &mdash; not to mention her clientele of regular patrons and their bizarre [[Sexual fetishism|sexual fetishes]].\n\nAmong them is the \"Reverend\" Peter Shayne ([[Anthony Perkins]]), who alternately spends his time delivering [[soapbox]] sermons on the street, visiting [[peep show]]s while sniffing [[amyl nitrite]], and patronizing prostitutes. Shayne has been seeing China Blue as a customer and declares a misguided need to \"save\" her. (When he says, \"Save your [[Soul (spirit)|soul]], whore!\", she replies, \"Save your money, shithead.\") Underscoring Shayne's contradictory nature is the cache of [[sex toy]]s he carries in a small [[doctor's bag]] with his [[Bible]].\n\nGrady admits he may leave his wife and children, but Joanna feels put-upon and [[depression (mood)|depressed]]. She seeks solace in turning tricks because the encounters are not fraught with emotional entanglements. She dominates a young policeman in an [[Sadomasochism|S&M]] session, penetrating him with his [[Baton (law enforcement)|nightstick]], and endures a botched [[m\u00e9nage \u00e0 trois|three-way]] in a limousine. A session with a dying man whose wife wants China Blue to give him sexual gratification one last time inspires Joanna to reveal her real first name, suggesting for the first time that she is the proverbial \"[[hooker with a heart of gold]].\"\n\nShayne grows increasingly psychotic: he carries a sharpened metallic [[Vibrator (sex toy)|vibrator]] he nicknames \"Superman\" and starts [[stalking]] Joanna. He moves into a seedy motel next door to her nighttime place of business and watches her activities through a peephole. He also sets up a shrine with candles and numerous photos of her. Sensing that he is mentally unhinged, Joanna no longer wishes to see him, but Shayne follows her home to her actual apartment. Once there, he begs her to kill him.\n\nGrady comes there to tell Joanna that he has left home. He hears shouting from her apartment, breaks down her door and finds someone he assumes is Joanna, cowering in terror, not realizing it is actually Shayne in her China Blue disguise. Joanna, now wearing Shayne's clothing, leaps from the shadows and stabs Shayne with the \"Superman\" vibrator before he can attack Grady with a large pair of scissors. Shayne dies, convinced that his sacrifice has \"saved\" them both.\n\nThe film ends with Grady addressing his group therapist about his new relationship with a woman named Joanna.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Kathleen Turner]] as Joanna Crane / China Blue\n* [[Anthony Perkins]] as Reverend Peter Shayne\n* [[John Laughlin (actor)|John Laughlin]] as Bobby Grady\n* [[Annie Potts]] as Amy Grady\n* [[Bruce Davison]] as Donny Hopper\n* [[Yvonne McCord]] as Sheila\n* [[Stephen Lee (actor)|Stephen Lee]] as Jerry\n* [[Louise Sorel]] as Claudia\n\n==Production==\n===Script===\nThe film was based on an original script by Barry Sandler. Sandler started writing it in the late 1970s.\n<blockquote>I was tapping into what was going on around me during the eighties, it was just at the beginning of the advent of the AIDS crisis\u2026 people had difficulties with their relationships, there was a lot of sex going on and it was very easily accessible and a lot of people were using it as kind of an excuse or a defence or a rationale or some way to avoid intimacy, to avoid relationships.<ref name=\"star\"/></blockquote>\nSandler said he did \"about forty drafts\" of the script before Ken Russell saw it. It began as a two character piece of China Blue and Shayne, with Shayne masquerading as a psychiatrist, and China Blue as a single woman who was very sexually compulsive. He introduced the Grady character who became more prominent and Joanna became a prostitute.<ref name=\"star\">{{cite magazine |magazine=Starburst |url=https://www.starburstmagazine.com/features/barry-sandler-interview |first=Ian |last=White |date=22 August 2016 |title=Barry Sandler CRIMES OF PASSION}}</ref>\n\nSander had meetings with [[John Frankenheimer]], [[Bob Rafelson]] and [[John Carpenter]] as well as [[Cher]] but had trouble getting finance because of the film's content.<ref name=\"jeff\"/>\n\n===Ken Russell===\nSandler's agent suggested he send the film to Ken Russell. \"They knew it was a very risky, very daring project,\" said the writer. \"And let\u2019s face it, you couldn\u2019t get more of a risky and audacious filmmaker than Ken Russell!\"<ref name=\"star\"/>\n\nRussell says the script \"offered something new in dealing with sex and family life and the masks we accept. It's a powerful subject, and I was quite taken with it, especially when I saw it dealt with these religious hucksters on tv. I know I was obsessed with these terrible preachers.\"<ref name=\"boston\"/>\n\nRussell called it a \"film about the exploitation of women, especially at the hands of the macho American male... Americans are asked to live in a world of complete fantasy which they can never live up to.\"<ref name=\"talent\"/>\n\nAlthough ''Altered States'' was a financial success Russell had found difficulty making his next film. One project, ''Beethoven's Secret'' was about to start shooting when financing fell apart at the last minute. He was attached to do the film of ''Evita'' for over a year, but ultimately left the project when he refused to cast [[Elaine Paige]] in the lead. A biopic of [[Maria Callas]] with [[Sophia Loren]] also failed to get financing. However Russell found himself artistically rejuvenated when offered the chance to direct some opera. He did ''The Rake's Progress'', ''Soldiers'' and ''Butterfly''. <ref>MOVIES: KEN RUSSELL: OPERA HIGHS AFTER FILM LOWS\nMann, Roderick. Los Angeles Times 22 Jan 1984: r14. /</ref>\n\nSandler says Russell \"was very reluctant to get involved with another American film after the experience he had with (Paddy) Chayefsky on \u2018Altered States\u2019. He didn't want to risk losing control. Apparently, he had turned down a lot of projects, but there was something about Crimes that connected with him. We talked about it, we had a great relationship that extended for years up until his death.\"<ref name=\"star\"/>\n\nWith Russell attached, Sandler took the film to New World Pictures. They had a new head of production, [[Jonathan Axelrod]] who wanted to move the company \"into a more sophisticated area\" and they agreed to finance in association with Orion Pictures.<ref name=\"star\"/>\n\n===Casting===\nThe male lead was given to Tony Perkins. \"It's a marvelous role,\" said Perkins, \"unlike anything I've ever done.\"<ref name=\"tony\"/>\n\nRussell had an excellent working relationship with Sandler. Sandler says the biggest change to the script came with the character of Shayne. Originally he was written as a psychiatrist but Anthony Perkins had just played a psychiatrist on Broadway in ''Equus'' and did not want to play another psychiatrist. Russell came up with the idea of making him a reverend.<ref name=\"star\"/>\n\nKathleen Turner had read the script and wanted to do the film, over the advice of her agent, because she wanted to break away from her image in ''Romancing the Stone''.<ref name=\"jeff\">{{cite web|url=http://jeffcramer.blogspot.com/2010/07/very-candid-conversation-with-barry.html|website=Stone Cold Crazy|date=July 1, 2010|title=A Very Candid Conversation with Barry Sandler}}</ref>\n\nSandler says [[Jeff Bridges]] read the script and wanted to do the role of Grady, dropping his price from $3 million to $1 million, but the film could not afford him. [[Patrick Swayze]] and [[Alec Baldwin]] auditioned but it was decided to go with John Laughlin. \"He was this guy plucked out of nowhere, so I think he felt a little uneasy and nervous, but it kind of worked for the character,\" said Sandler. \"He sort of saw that in him and actually pushed his buttons in that direction because he thought it worked for the character, who was very uncomfortable and uneasy and all that.\"<ref name=\"jeff\"/>\n\n===Filming===\nFilming started April 1984. The film was shot at Zoetrope Studios with a mostly non union crew.<ref name=\"talent\"/>\n\nRock musician [[Rick Wakeman]] performed the [[synthesizer]]-heavy [[film score|score]], the majority of which is made up of melodies directly lifted from [[Czech Republic|Czech]] composer [[Anton\u00edn Dvo\u0159\u00e1k]]'s \"[[New World Symphony]]\".\n\nWakeman has an uncredited role in the film as a wedding photographer.\n\nSandler says Russell \"was most intrigued by the China Blue/Shayne scenes. The scenes with Kathleen and Tony. And that kind of high-pitched almost surreal interplay fascinated him, dealing with themes of masks and facades, illusions and deceptions, with these two outrageous characters going at each other. He was less intrigued with the other aspect of the film which was the Grady home life.\"<ref name=\"star\"/>\n\nPerkins loved working with Russell. \"You spend so much of your career working with directors who just don't want to bother listening to your ideas. It's wonderful to find a man like Ken who not only listens but actively encourages you to come up with your thoughts.\" <ref name=\"tony\"/>\n\nTurner says  she felt \"really good\" about the film \"because I feel that was really brave, and I was risking a lot there - in an acting sense. I was satisfied with that. I think that's some of my best work. I don't think the film is as good as it could have been, but I'm very proud of my work in it. Ken made me brave. Ken Russell. And my agent was encouraging. Plus I was feeling a little rebellious around that time. I saw public popularity as a kind of entrapment, and I wanted some danger. I didn't want to get trapped in fulfilling people's conceptions of me over and over again. I felt pressure and I wanted to break out. \"<ref>KATHLEEN TURNER/INTERVIEW: SHE'S BLONDER AND SASSIER - AND BIGGER THAN EVER\nBALTAKE, JOE.

Even now that it's trimmed, I expect it will offend some people. Ken Russell's films usually do. But it's adventurous filmmaking of the best kind. And that's what people want, isn't it? Too often recently, delicate subjects have been tackled so timidly that they've found no audience at all. I'm glad it's turned out to be controversial. People will either love it or hate it. And that's what you need if you want people to come and see your film today. Even raves from the critics no longer guarantee you an audience. A film has to be talked about. And this one will be.\"<ref name=\"tony\">TONY PERKINS: THE 'CRIMES' OF HIS HEART\nMann, Roderick. Los Angeles Times 7 Oct 1984: x24.</ref>\n==Rating Controversy==\nThe film was given an X rating. Russell re-cut it and re-submitted it hoping for an R, but was unsuccessful. New World refused to release it unless it was rated R, so Russell was asked to cut it a third time. \"I just don't see an end to it,\" said Russell. \"All we have left is two children drinking orange juice at breakfast.\"<ref>FILM CLIPS: RUSSELL'S 'CRIMES' STIRS PASSION OVER ITS RATING London, Michael.

Then you have to face the fact that no distributor wants an X. Or that you won't be able to get advertising in many newspapers. Or that you won't be able to get air time on most TV and radio stations. Some time in the last 10 years, an X rating became an automatic stamp of pornography.\"<ref name=\"clips\">NY CLIPS X marks the spot cooler heads prevail\nStuart, Jan. The Globe and Mail 19 Oct 1984: E.3. </ref> \n\nSandler says the head of the ratings board contacted him and suggested they release the film as an X and reclaim that rating. \"Because we had Ken Russell and Kathleen Turner and Tony in a legitimate film, they thought we could re-legitimise the X rating. But the studio didn\u2019t want to hear it, so they made us cut the film.\"<ref name=\"star\"/>\n\nRussell added to do further cuts \"would do the film I was commissioned to do irreparable harm. The only thing one can do is make a stand and avoid being steamrolled.

I would think the film in its present form loses some of the motivations. Some of what China Blue does must now seem arbitrary.\"<ref name=\"boston\">'CRIMES' CUTS IRK RUSSELL Carr, Jay.

Sandler says when they previewed the film \"people were intensely upset by that scene...

Russell came up with the idea of making him a reverend.<ref name=\"star\"/>\n\nKathleen Turner had read the script and wanted to do the film, over the advice of her agent, because she wanted to break away from her image in ''Romancing the Stone''.<ref name=\"jeff\">{{cite web|url=http://jeffcramer.blogspot.com/2010/07/very-candid-conversation-with-barry.html|website=Stone Cold Crazy|date=July 1, 2010|title=A Very Candid Conversation with Barry Sandler}}</ref>\n\nSandler says [[Jeff Bridges]] read the script and wanted to do the role of Grady, dropping his price from $3 million to $1 million, but the film could not afford him. [[Patrick Swayze]] and [[Alec Baldwin]] auditioned but it was decided to go with John Laughlin. \"He was this guy plucked out of nowhere, so I think he felt a little uneasy and nervous, but it kind of worked for the character,\" said Sandler. \"He sort of saw that in him and actually pushed his buttons in that direction because he thought it worked for the character, who was very uncomfortable and uneasy and all that.\"<ref name=\"jeff\"/>\n\n===Filming===\nFilming started April 1984. The film was shot at Zoetrope Studios with a mostly non union crew.<ref name=\"talent\"/>\n\nRock musician [[Rick Wakeman]] performed the [[synthesizer]]-heavy [[film score|score]], the majority of which is made up of melodies directly lifted from [[Czech Republic|Czech]] composer [[Anton\u00edn Dvo\u0159\u00e1k]]'s \"[[New World Symphony]]\".\n\nWakeman has an uncredited role in the film as a wedding photographer.\n\nSandler says Russell \"was most intrigued by the China Blue/Shayne scenes. The scenes with Kathleen and Tony. And that kind of high-pitched almost surreal interplay fascinated him, dealing with themes of masks and facades, illusions and deceptions, with these two outrageous characters going at each other. He was less intrigued with the other aspect of the film which was the Grady home life.\"<ref name=\"star\"/>\n\nPerkins loved working with Russell. \"You spend so much of your career working with directors who just don't want to bother listening to your ideas. It's wonderful to find a man like Ken who not only listens but actively encourages you to come up with your thoughts.\" <ref name=\"tony\"/>\n\nTurner says  she felt \"really good\" about the film \"because I feel that was really brave, and I was risking a lot there - in an acting sense. I was satisfied with that. I think that's some of my best work. I don't think the film is as good as it could have been, but I'm very proud of my work in it. Ken made me brave. Ken Russell. And my agent was encouraging. Plus I was feeling a little rebellious around that time. I saw public popularity as a kind of entrapment, and I wanted some danger. I didn't want to get trapped in fulfilling people's conceptions of me over and over again. I felt pressure and I wanted to break out. \"<ref>KATHLEEN TURNER/INTERVIEW: SHE'S BLONDER AND SASSIER - AND BIGGER THAN EVER\nBALTAKE, JOE. Philadelphia Daily News 13 Dec 1985: 70. </ref>\n\nTurner wrote in her memoirs that shooting was made difficult by Perkins' drug problem and Russell's heavy drinking.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Send yourself roses : thoughts on my life, love, and leading roles|last1=Turner|first1= Kathleen|last2=Feldt|first2= Gloria|year=2008|publisher=Springboard Russell|page= 95}}</ref>\n\n===Russell Marriage===\nAt the film's wrap party aboard the Queen Mary on Long Beach, Russell married his long time companion, Vivian Jolly. The ceremony was officiated by Anthony Perkins, who was an ordained minister with the Universal Life Church.<ref>FILM CLIPS: SHOW-BIZ WOMEN'S BAITLE LINES HOLLYWOOD WOMEN'S COALITION\nLondon, Michael. Los Angeles Times8 June 1984: sd_c1.</ref> Perkins said Russell was the one who suggested it. \"I thought he was kidding,\" said Perkins. \"But then it turned out he'd done some research and discovered that if we paid $25 I could become a member of the Universal Life Church and would be eligible to marry them.\"<ref>BRIEFLY Actor enjoys marrying people\nThe Globe and Mail 17 Oct 1984: M.11. </ref>\n\n\"It's an extraordinary film,\" said Perkins. \"And it will jolt people. Even now that it's trimmed, I expect it will offend some people. Ken Russell's films usually do. But it's adventurous filmmaking of the best kind. And that's what people want, isn't it? Too often recently, delicate subjects have been tackled so timidly that they've found no audience at all. I'm glad it's turned out to be controversial. People will either love it or hate it. And that's what you need if you want people to come and see your film today. Even raves from the critics no longer guarantee you an audience. A film has to be talked about. And this one will be.\"<ref name=\"tony\">TONY PERKINS: THE 'CRIMES' OF HIS HEART\nMann, Roderick. Los Angeles Times 7 Oct 1984: x24.</ref>\n==Rating Controversy==\nThe film was given an X rating. Russell re-cut it and re-submitted it hoping for an R, but was unsuccessful. New World refused to release it unless it was rated R, so Russell was asked to cut it a third time. \"I just don't see an end to it,\" said Russell. \"All we have left is two children drinking orange juice at breakfast.\"<ref>FILM CLIPS: RUSSELL'S 'CRIMES' STIRS PASSION OVER ITS RATING London, Michael. Los Angeles Times 21 Sep 1984: sd_c1. </ref>\n\nSandler said, \"In the purest sense, it's justified - you can do anything you want to in your movie, as long as you're willing to go with an X rating. Then you have to face the fact that no distributor wants an X. Or that you won't be able to get advertising in many newspapers. Or that you won't be able to get air time on most TV and radio stations. Some time in the last 10 years, an X rating became an automatic stamp of pornography.\"<ref name=\"clips\">NY CLIPS X marks the spot cooler heads prevail\nStuart, Jan. The Globe and Mail 19 Oct 1984: E.3. </ref> \n\nSandler says the head of the ratings board contacted him and suggested they release the film as an X and reclaim that rating. \"Because we had Ken Russell and Kathleen Turner and Tony in a legitimate film, they thought we could re-legitimise the X rating. But the studio didn\u2019t want to hear it, so they made us cut the film.\"<ref name=\"star\"/>\n\nRussell added to do further cuts \"would do the film I was commissioned to do irreparable harm. The only thing one can do is make a stand and avoid being steamrolled. Even if you're squashed flat, it's better than conning the public with something you don't believe in.\"<ref name=\"cut\">FILM CLIPS: COMEBACK TRAIL FOR WESTERNS FILM CLIPS\nLondon, Michael. Los Angeles Times 26 Sep 1984: j1. </ref>\n\n[[Robert Rehme]] head of New World admitted further cuts \"probably would hurt the picture\" but felt it would not affect its box office fortunes.<ref name=\"cut\"/> Once Russell heard the changes New World were going to make regardless, he agreed to make further cuts and the film got an R.<ref>LA CLIPS Russell relents and recuts\nDeans, Laurie. The Globe and Mail 12 Oct 1984: E.3. </ref>\n\nSandler said, \"We kept cutting a little more each time and, by the fifth round of cuts, I think they were all so beaten down from looking at the thing and from pressure from the press and elsewhere that they finally went with an R.\"<ref name=\"star\"/> \n\nRussell said the cuts he did were of \"a sex shadow show on a wall and a rather climactic scene of sado-masochistic bent, also a scene where China Blue cracks, and several scenes of erotic art that are her mental reactions to what's happening to her. I would think the film in its present form loses some of the motivations. Some of what China Blue does must now seem arbitrary.\"<ref name=\"boston\">'CRIMES' CUTS IRK RUSSELL Carr, Jay. Boston Globe 16 Nov 1984: 61. </ref>\n \nOne scene that was cut in its entirety was one where Kathleen Turner takes a cop home and they get involved with a nightstick. Sandler says when they previewed the film \"people were intensely upset by that scene... It was clear that, had we kept it in, it would have made a lot of people extremely uncomfortable.\" <ref name=\"star\"/>\n\n[[Brian De Palma]] said he thought the film \"was affected deeply by the cuts that were made in it.

You're not dealing with some guy shooting pornography in a back room somewhere.\"<ref>BRIAN DE PALMA FOR SUSPENSE, TERROR AND SEX, HE'S THE MAN FOR THE JOB: [FIFTH Edition]\nWILLISTEIN, PAUL.

Much of this is attributable to a screenplay... filled with smutty double-entendres and weighty ironies. Only intermittently does Mr. Russell break through with the kind of manic flamboyance that is so singularly and rudely his own.\"<ref>FILM: TONY PERKINS IN 'CRIMES OF PASSION' Maslin, Janet. New York Times 19 Oct 1984: C.19. </ref>\n\nPerkins later said \"there are great moments in that film that could only come from a genius. He was on to something about the nature of religion and evil that few people could ever find. Yet, it was, in the end, a bit of a disappointment because it had no plot. . . no story. The images were great, but there was nothing to hang them on.\" <ref>'I'M TRYING TO MAKE FILMS THAT WAKE PEOPLE UP': [THIRD Edition]\nBlowen, Michael.
