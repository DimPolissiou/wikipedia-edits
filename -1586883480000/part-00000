His mother, Berta Patay was a reputed pianist and teacher, so the young Seiber gained considerable skill with that instrument first. At the age of ten, he began to learn to play the cello. After attending grammar school, where he was regarded as \"outstanding\" in mathematics and Latin according to the almanacs of the [[Franz Liszt Academy of Music]], he studied the cello and composition from 1918 to 1925, and composition with [[Zolt\u00e1n Kod\u00e1ly]] from 1921 to 1925. For his degree, he wrote his String Quartet No. 1 (in A minor).<ref>{{cite web |url=http://lfze.hu/en/notable-alumni/-/asset_publisher/fLQ9RSuRgn0e/content/seiber-matyas/10192/ |title= M\u00e1ty\u00e1s Seiber, Notable Alumni Franz Liszt Academy of Music|work=}}</ref>\n\n==Career==\nHe toured Hungary with Zolt\u00e1n Kod\u00e1ly, collecting folk songs, and built on the research of [[Kod\u00e1ly]] and [[Bart\u00f3k]]. He developed an interest in medieval [[plainchant]].\n\nIn 1925, Seiber accepted a teaching position at a private music school. In 1926, he took a position to play the cello in the orchestra of a ship from to North and South America. This was where became acquainted with [[jazz]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://lfze.hu/en/notable-alumni/-/asset_publisher/fLQ9RSuRgn0e/content/seiber-matyas/10192/ |title=M\u00e1ty\u00e1s Seiber, Notable Alumni Franz Liszt Academy of Music}}</ref>\n\nIn 1928 he became director of the jazz department at the [[Hoch Conservatory]] in Frankfurt, which offered the first academic jazz courses anywhere.<ref>See article and references here: [[Timeline of jazz education]]</ref> His text book ''Schule f\u00fcr Jazz-Schlagzeug'' was written in 1929, as a practical summary of his theoretical requirements. Two of his articles of great importance were published in the journal ''Melos'': \"Jazz als Erziehungsmittel\" (1928) and \"Jazz-Instrumente, Jazz-Klang und Neue Musik\" (1930). After the jazz department was closed by the [[Nazi]]s in 1933, Seiber left Germany.\n\nHe returned to Hungary but did not settle there; he worked as a music [[referent]] in the Soviet Union for two years, but his employment was ended after that.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://lfze.hu/en/notable-alumni/-/asset_publisher/fLQ9RSuRgn0e/content/seiber-matyas/10192/ |title=M\u00e1ty\u00e1s Seiber, Notable Alumni Franz Liszt Academy of Music|accessdate=2016-09-29}}</ref>\n\nSeiber emigrated to England in 1935 and settled in London after his marriage in Caterham. He became a British subject the same year. He taught composition and cello privately while working as a consultant for the subsidiary of Schott in London and composed film music.\n\nMichael Tippett invited him to be a professor of composition at [[Morley College]] in London, and from 1942 he was on the staff there; he became a teacher of [[Musical composition|composition]], music aesthetics, and music theory. His students included [[Peter Racine Fricker]], [[Don Banks]], [[Anthony Milner]], [[Hugh Wood]], [[Karel Janovick\u00fd]], [[Malcolm Lipkin]], [[John Exton (composer)|John Exton]], Wally Stott (who later became [[Angela Morley]]) and [[Barry Gray]]. During this period, he created and trained his choir, the Dorian Singers.\n\nHis friendships and work associations embraced many soloists, including [[Tibor Varga (violinist)|Tibor Varga]], [[Norbert Brainin]], guitarists [[Julian Bream]] and [[John Williams]], percussionist [[Jimmy Blades]], folk singer [[Bert Lloyd]], and tenor [[Peter Pears]].<ref>{{cite web |url=https://en.schott-music.com/shop/authordata/Authordata/view/id/17467/?SID=9moi01g9s9o13tlql5q9ksuo34&___store=schott_en&___from_store=schott_de |title= Schott Music|work=}}</ref>\n\nHe was a founder member of the Society for Promotion of New Music, actively promoting new music throughout his life. He was married to ballet dancer Lilla Bauer, another Hungarian \u00e9migr\u00e9. In 1960 he was invited to do a lecture tour in South Africa, but he died there in [[Kruger National Park]] as the result of a car accident. Kod\u00e1ly dedicated his choral work titled ''Media vita in morte sumus'' to the memory of his former student.\n\n==Music==\nSeiber's music is eclectic in style, showing the influences of jazz, [[B\u00e9la Bart\u00f3k|Bart\u00f3k]] and [[Arnold Schoenberg|Schoenberg]].\n\nHis output includes ''Ulysses'' (1947), a [[cantata]] on words by [[James Joyce]] (he recorded another Joyce-related work, ''Three Fragments from \"A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man\"'', for [[Decca Records|Decca]] shortly before his death); a clarinet concertino; scores to animated films, including ''[[Animal Farm (1954 film)|Animal Farm]]'' (1954); a setting of the Scottish \"poet and tragedian\" [[William McGonagall]]'s work, ''[[The Famous Tay Whale]]'' (written for the second of [[Gerard Hoffnung]]'s music festivals); three string quartets; and choral arrangements of Hungarian and [[Yugoslavia|Yugoslav]] folk songs.\n<ref>[http://www.suppressedmusic.org.uk/newsletter/articles/005.html The Seiber Centenary: 2005 and Beyond by Julia Seiber Boyd ICSM Online Journal 09 August 2005]</ref>\nHe also wrote one opera, ''Eva spielt mit Puppen'' (1934),<ref>[http://opera.stanford.edu/composers/S.html Opera Glass]</ref> and the ballet ''[[The Invitation (ballet)|The Invitation]]''. His composition for violin,  ''Fantasia concertante'' was recorded by [[Andre Gertler]].\n\nHis two comic operas, ''A Pal\u00e1gyi Pekek'' and ''Balaton'', were composed for the Hungarian theatre in London, the \"Londoni P\u00f3dium\". ''A Pal\u00e1gyi P\u00e9kek'', (libretto, Gy\u00f6rgy Mikes) (1943), was the first collaboration of M\u00e1ty\u00e1s Seiber and [[George Mikes]].

His mother, Berta Patay was a reputed pianist and teacher, so the young Seiber gained considerable skill with that instrument first. At the age of ten, he began to learn to play the cello. After attending grammar school, where he was regarded as \"outstanding\" in mathematics and Latin according to the almanacs of the [[Franz Liszt Academy of Music]], he studied the cello and composition from 1918 to 1925, and composition with [[Zolt\u00e1n Kod\u00e1ly]] from 1921 to 1925. For his degree, he wrote his String Quartet No. 1 (in A minor).<ref>{{cite web |url=http://lfze.hu/en/notable-alumni/-/asset_publisher/fLQ9RSuRgn0e/content/seiber-matyas/10192/ |title= M\u00e1ty\u00e1s Seiber, Notable Alumni Franz Liszt Academy of Music|format= |work=}}</ref>\n\n==Career==\nHe toured Hungary with Zolt\u00e1n Kod\u00e1ly, collecting folk songs, and built on the research of [[Kod\u00e1ly]] and [[Bart\u00f3k]]. He developed an interest in medieval [[plainchant]].\n\nIn 1925, Seiber accepted a teaching position at a private music school. In 1926, he took a position to play the cello in the orchestra of a ship from to North and South America. This was where became acquainted with [[jazz]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://lfze.hu/en/notable-alumni/-/asset_publisher/fLQ9RSuRgn0e/content/seiber-matyas/10192/ |title=M\u00e1ty\u00e1s Seiber, Notable Alumni Franz Liszt Academy of Music}}</ref>\n\nIn 1928 he became director of the jazz department at the [[Hoch Conservatory]] in Frankfurt, which offered the first academic jazz courses anywhere.<ref>See article and references here: [[Timeline of jazz education]]</ref> His text book ''Schule f\u00fcr Jazz-Schlagzeug'' was written in 1929, as a practical summary of his theoretical requirements. Two of his articles of great importance were published in the journal ''Melos'': \"Jazz als Erziehungsmittel\" (1928) and \"Jazz-Instrumente, Jazz-Klang und Neue Musik\" (1930). After the jazz department was closed by the [[Nazi]]s in 1933, Seiber left Germany.\n\nHe returned to Hungary but did not settle there; he worked as a music [[referent]] in the Soviet Union for two years, but his employment was ended after that.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://lfze.hu/en/notable-alumni/-/asset_publisher/fLQ9RSuRgn0e/content/seiber-matyas/10192/ |title=M\u00e1ty\u00e1s Seiber, Notable Alumni Franz Liszt Academy of Music|accessdate=2016-09-29}}</ref>\n\nSeiber emigrated to England in 1935 and settled in London after his marriage in Caterham. He became a British subject the same year. He taught composition and cello privately while working as a consultant for the subsidiary of Schott in London and composed film music.\n\nMichael Tippett invited him to be a professor of composition at [[Morley College]] in London, and from 1942 he was on the staff there; he became a teacher of [[Musical composition|composition]], music aesthetics, and music theory. His students included [[Peter Racine Fricker]], [[Don Banks]], [[Anthony Milner]], [[Hugh Wood]], [[Karel Janovick\u00fd]], [[Malcolm Lipkin]], [[John Exton (composer)|John Exton]], Wally Stott (who later became [[Angela Morley]]) and [[Barry Gray]]. During this period, he created and trained his choir, the Dorian Singers.\n\nHis friendships and work associations embraced many soloists, including [[Tibor Varga (violinist)|Tibor Varga]], [[Norbert Brainin]], guitarists [[Julian Bream]] and [[John Williams]], percussionist [[Jimmy Blades]], folk singer [[Bert Lloyd]], and tenor [[Peter Pears]].<ref>{{cite web |url=https://en.schott-music.com/shop/authordata/Authordata/view/id/17467/?SID=9moi01g9s9o13tlql5q9ksuo34&___store=schott_en&___from_store=schott_de |title= Schott Music|work=}}</ref>\n\nHe was a founder member of the Society for Promotion of New Music, actively promoting new music throughout his life.

The gonads, in a \"bipotential state\", may develop into either testes (the male gonads) or ovaries (the female gonads), depending on the consequent events.<ref name=\"Kolodny\" /> Through the seventh week, genetically female and genetically male fetuses appear identical.\n\nAt around eight weeks of gestation, the gonads of an XY embryo differentiate into functional testes, secreting testosterone. Ovarian differentiation, for XX embryos, does not occur until approximately week 12 of gestation. In typical female differentiation, the [[M\u00fcllerian duct|M\u00fcllerian duct system]] develops into the [[uterus]], [[Fallopian tubes]], and inner third of the vagina.\nIn males, the M\u00fcllerian duct-inhibiting hormone [[Anti-M\u00fcllerian hormone|MIH]] causes this duct system to regress. Next, androgens cause the development of the [[Wolffian duct|Wolffian duct system]], which develops into the [[vas deferens]], seminal vesicles, and ejaculatory ducts.<ref name=\"Kolodny\" />\nBy birth, the typical fetus has been completely \"sexed\" male or female, meaning that the genetic sex (XY-male or XX-female) corresponds with the phenotypical sex; that is to say, genetic sex corresponds with internal and external gonads, and external appearance of the genitals.\n\n===Signs===\nThere are a variety of symptoms that can occur. Ambiguous genitalia being the most common sign, there can be [[micropenis]], [[clitoromegaly]], partial [[labial fusion]], electrolyte abnormalities, delayed or absent puberty, unexpected changes at puberty, hypospadias, labial or inguinal (groin) masses (which may turn out to be testes) in girls and  [[undescended testes]] (which may turn out to be ovaries) in boys.<ref name=\":0\"/>\n\n====Ambiguous genitalia====\n\nAmbiguous genitalia may appear as a large [[clitoris]] or as a small penis.\n[[File:Quigley scale for androgen insensitivity syndrome.jpg|thumb|The [[Quigley scale]] is a method for describing genital development in AIS.]]\nBecause there is variation in all of the processes of the [[Sex organ#Development|development of the sex organs]], a child can be born with a [[sexual anatomy]] that is typically female or feminine in appearance with a larger-than-average [[clitoris]] ([[clitoral hypertrophy]]) or typically male or masculine in appearance with a smaller-than-average [[penis]] that is open along the underside. The appearance may be quite ambiguous, describable as female genitals with a very large clitoris and partially fused labia, or as male genitals with a very small penis, completely open along the midline (\"[[hypospadic]]\"), and empty scrotum.

The genes that cause CAH can now be detected in the developing embryo. As Fausto-Sterling mentioned in chapter 3 of ''Sexing the Body'', \"a woman who suspects she may be pregnant with a CAH baby (if she or someone in her family carries CAH) can undergo treatment and then get tested.\" To prevent an XX-CAH child's genitalia from becoming masculinized, a treatment, which includes the use of the steroid dexamethasone, can begin as early as four weeks after formation. Many do not favor this process because \"the safety of this experimental therapy has not been established in rigorously controlled trials\", it does allow physicians to detect CAH, therefore enabling the start of treatment right after birth. Starting treatment as soon as an XX-CAH baby is born not only minimizes but also may even eliminate the chances of genital surgery from being performed.<ref name=\"Anne_Fausto-Sterling_2000\" /> However, the necessity of such surgery itself is disputed.\n\nMeta-analysis of the studies supporting the use of dexamethasone on CAH at-risk fetuses found \"less than one half of one percent of published 'studies' of this intervention were regarded as being of high enough quality to provide meaningful data for a meta-analysis.

The latter applies in particular to [[congenital adrenal hyperplasia due to 21-hydroxylase deficiency]], which is the most common form of CAH.\n\nIndividuals born with XX chromosomes affected by [[congenital adrenal hyperplasia due to 17 alpha-hydroxylase deficiency|17\u03b1-hydroxylase deficiency]] are born with female internal and external anatomy, but, at puberty, neither the adrenals nor the ovaries can produce sex-hormones, inhibiting breast development and the growth of pubic hair.\n\nSee below for XY CAH 17\u03b1-hydroxylase deficiency.\n |-\n | XX || [[Progestin-induced virilisation]] || In this case, the excess androgen hormones are caused by the use of [[progestin]], a drug that was used in the 1950s and 1960s to prevent miscarriage. These individuals typically have internal and external female anatomy, with functional ovaries and will therefore have menstruation. They develop, however, some male secondary sex characteristics and they frequently have unusually large clitorises. In very advanced cases, such children have initially been identified as males.{{mcn|date=April 2018}}\n |-\n | XX || [[Freemartin]]ism || This condition occurs commonly in all species of [[Bovinae|cattle]] and affects most females born as a twin to a male. It is rare or unknown in other mammals, including humans. In cattle, the [[placenta]]e of [[fraternal twins]] usually fuse at some time during the pregnancy, and the twins then share their blood supply. If the twins are of different sexes, male hormones produced in the body of the fetal bull find their way into the body of the fetal heifer (female), and masculinize her. Her sexual organs do not develop fully, and her ovaries may even contain testicular tissue. When adult, such a ''freemartin'' is very like a typical female in external appearance, but she is infertile, and behaves more like a [[Castration|castrated]] male (a steer). The male twin is not significantly affected, although (if he remains entire) his testes may be slightly reduced in size. The degree of masculinization of the freemartin depends on the stage of pregnancy at which the placental fusion occurs{{spaced ndash}}in about ten percent of such births no fusion occurs and both calves develop typically for their chromosomal sex.\n |-\n | XY || [[Androgen insensitivity syndrome]] (AIS) || People with AIS have a Y chromosome, (typically XY), but are unable to metabolize androgens in varying degrees.\n\nCases with typically female appearance and genitalia are said to have complete androgen insensitivity syndrome (CAIS). People with CAIS have a [[vagina]] and no [[uterus]], [[cervix]], or [[ovaries]], and are infertile. The vagina may be shorter than usual, and, in some cases, is nearly absent. Instead of female internal reproductive organs, a person with CAIS has undescended or partially descended testes, of which the person may not even be aware.\n\nIn mild and partial androgen insensitivity syndrome (MAIS and PAIS), the body is partially receptive to androgens, so there is virilization to varying degrees. PAIS can result in genital ambiguity, due to limited metabolization of the androgens produced by the testes. Ambiguous genitalia may present as a large clitoris, known as [[clitoromegaly]], or a small penis, which is called [[micropenis]] or microphallus; hypospadias and [[cryptorchidism]] may also be present, with one or both testes undescended, and hypospadias appearing just below the glans on an otherwise typical male penis, or at the base of the shaft, or at the perineum and including a bifid (or cleft) scrotum.\n |-\n | XY || [[5-alpha-reductase deficiency]] (5-ARD) || The condition affects individuals with a [[Y chromosome]], making their bodies unable to convert testosterone to dihydrotestosterone (DHT). DHT is necessary for the development of male genitalia in utero, and plays no role in female development, so its absence tends to result in ambiguous genitalia at birth; the effects can range from infertility with male genitalia to male underdevelopment with hypospadias to female genitalia with mild clitoromegaly. The frequency is unknown, and children are sometimes misdiagnosed as having AIS.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.emedicine.com/ped/topic1980.htm |title=eMedicine article on 5-ARD |publisher=Emedicine.com |date=23 June 2009 |accessdate=21 August 2009 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081017193051/http://www.emedicine.com/ped/topic1980.htm |archivedate=17 October 2008 |df=dmy-all }}</ref> Individuals can have testes, as well as vagina and labia, and a small penis capable of ejaculation that looks like a clitoris at birth. Such individuals are usually raised as girls. The lack of DHT also limits the development of facial hair.\n |-\n | XY || [[Congenital adrenal hyperplasia]] (CAH) || In individuals with a Y chromosome (typically XY) who have [[Congenital adrenal hyperplasia due to 17 alpha-hydroxylase deficiency]], CAH inhibits virilization, unlike cases without a Y chromosome.\n |-\n | XY || [[Persistent M\u00fcllerian duct syndrome]] (PMDS) || The child has XY chromosomes typical of a male. The child has a male body and an internal uterus and fallopian tubes because his body did not produce [[M\u00fcllerian inhibiting factor]] during fetal development.\n |-\n | XY || [[Anorchia]] || Individuals with XY chromosomes whose gonads were lost after 14 weeks of fetal development. People with anorchia have no ability to produce the hormones responsible for developing male secondary sex characteristics nor the means to produce [[gamete]]s necessary for reproduction due to the lack of gonads. They may develop typically feminine secondary sex characteristics without or despite the administration of androgens to artificially initiate physical sex differentiation (typically planned around the age of puberty). Psychological and neurological gender identity may solidify before the administration of androgens, leading to [[gender dysphoria]], as anorchic individuals are typically [[sex assignment|assigned male at birth]].\n |-\n|XY||Gonadal dysgenesis|| It has various causes and are not all genetic; a catch-all category. <br /> It refers to individuals (mostly XY) whose gonads don't develop properly.

The gonads, in a \"bipotential state\", may develop into either testes (the male gonads) or ovaries (the female gonads), depending on the consequent events.<ref name=\"Kolodny\" /> Through the seventh week, genetically female and genetically male fetuses appear identical.\n\nAt around eight weeks of gestation, the gonads of an XY embryo differentiate into functional testes, secreting testosterone. Ovarian differentiation, for XX embryos, does not occur until approximately week 12 of gestation. In typical female differentiation, the [[M\u00fcllerian duct|M\u00fcllerian duct system]] develops into the [[uterus]], [[Fallopian tubes]], and inner third of the vagina.\nIn males, the M\u00fcllerian duct-inhibiting hormone [[Anti-M\u00fcllerian hormone|MIH]] causes this duct system to regress. Next, androgens cause the development of the [[Wolffian duct|Wolffian duct system]], which develops into the [[vas deferens]], seminal vesicles, and ejaculatory ducts.<ref name=\"Kolodny\" />\nBy birth, the typical fetus has been completely \"sexed\" male or female, meaning that the genetic sex (XY-male or XX-female) corresponds with the phenotypical sex; that is to say, genetic sex corresponds with internal and external gonads, and external appearance of the genitals.\n\n===Signs===\nThere are a variety of symptoms that can occur. Ambiguous genitalia being the most common sign, there can be [[micropenis]], [[clitoromegaly]], partial [[labial fusion]], electrolyte abnormalities, delayed or absent puberty, unexpected changes at puberty, hypospadias, labial or inguinal (groin) masses (which may turn out to be testes) in girls and  [[undescended testes]] (which may turn out to be ovaries) in boys.<ref name=\":0\"/>\n\n====Ambiguous genitalia====\n\nAmbiguous genitalia may appear as a large [[clitoris]] or as a small penis.\n[[File:Quigley scale for androgen insensitivity syndrome.jpg|thumb|The [[Quigley scale]] is a method for describing genital development in AIS.]]\nBecause there is variation in all of the processes of the [[Sex organ#Development|development of the sex organs]], a child can be born with a [[sexual anatomy]] that is typically female or feminine in appearance with a larger-than-average [[clitoris]] ([[clitoral hypertrophy]]) or typically male or masculine in appearance with a smaller-than-average [[penis]] that is open along the underside.

The genes that cause CAH can now be detected in the developing embryo. As Fausto-Sterling mentioned in chapter 3 of ''Sexing the Body'', \"a woman who suspects she may be pregnant with a CAH baby (if she or someone in her family carries CAH) can undergo treatment and then get tested.\" To prevent an XX-CAH child's genitalia from becoming masculinized, a treatment, which includes the use of the steroid dexamethasone, can begin as early as four weeks after formation. Many do not favor this process because \"the safety of this experimental therapy has not been established in rigorously controlled trials\", it does allow physicians to detect CAH, therefore enabling the start of treatment right after birth.

The latter applies in particular to [[congenital adrenal hyperplasia due to 21-hydroxylase deficiency]], which is the most common form of CAH.\n\nIndividuals born with XX chromosomes affected by [[congenital adrenal hyperplasia due to 17 alpha-hydroxylase deficiency|17\u03b1-hydroxylase deficiency]] are born with female internal and external anatomy, but, at puberty, neither the adrenals nor the ovaries can produce sex-hormones, inhibiting breast development and the growth of pubic hair.\n\nSee below for XY CAH 17\u03b1-hydroxylase deficiency.\n |-\n | XX || [[Progestin-induced virilisation]] || In this case, the excess androgen hormones are caused by the use of [[progestin]], a drug that was used in the 1950s and 1960s to prevent miscarriage. These individuals typically have internal and external female anatomy, with functional ovaries and will therefore have menstruation. They develop, however, some male secondary sex characteristics and they frequently have unusually large clitorises. In very advanced cases, such children have initially been identified as males.{{mcn|date=April 2018}}\n |-\n | XX || [[Freemartin]]ism || This condition occurs commonly in all species of [[Bovinae|cattle]] and affects most females born as a twin to a male. It is rare or unknown in other mammals, including humans. In cattle, the [[placenta]]e of [[fraternal twins]] usually fuse at some time during the pregnancy, and the twins then share their blood supply. If the twins are of different sexes, male hormones produced in the body of the fetal bull find their way into the body of the fetal heifer (female), and masculinize her. Her sexual organs do not develop fully, and her ovaries may even contain testicular tissue. When adult, such a ''freemartin'' is very like a typical female in external appearance, but she is infertile, and behaves more like a [[Castration|castrated]] male (a steer). The male twin is not significantly affected, although (if he remains entire) his testes may be slightly reduced in size. The degree of masculinization of the freemartin depends on the stage of pregnancy at which the placental fusion occurs{{spaced ndash}}in about ten percent of such births no fusion occurs and both calves develop typically for their chromosomal sex.\n |-\n | XY || [[Androgen insensitivity syndrome]] (AIS) || People with AIS have a Y chromosome, (typically XY), but are unable to metabolize androgens in varying degrees.\n\nCases with typically female appearance and genitalia are said to have complete androgen insensitivity syndrome (CAIS). People with CAIS have a [[vagina]] and no [[uterus]], [[cervix]], or [[ovaries]], and are infertile. The vagina may be shorter than usual, and, in some cases, is nearly absent. Instead of female internal reproductive organs, a person with CAIS has undescended or partially descended testes, of which the person may not even be aware.\n\nIn mild and partial androgen insensitivity syndrome (MAIS and PAIS), the body is partially receptive to androgens, so there is virilization to varying degrees. PAIS can result in genital ambiguity, due to limited metabolization of the androgens produced by the testes. Ambiguous genitalia may present as a large clitoris, known as [[clitoromegaly]], or a small penis, which is called [[micropenis]] or microphallus; hypospadias and [[cryptorchidism]] may also be present, with one or both testes undescended, and hypospadias appearing just below the glans on an otherwise typical male penis, or at the base of the shaft, or at the perineum and including a bifid (or cleft) scrotum.\n |-\n | XY || [[5-alpha-reductase deficiency]] (5-ARD) || The condition affects individuals with a [[Y chromosome]], making their bodies unable to convert testosterone to dihydrotestosterone (DHT). DHT is necessary for the development of male genitalia in utero, and plays no role in female development, so its absence tends to result in ambiguous genitalia at birth; the effects can range from infertility with male genitalia to male underdevelopment with hypospadias to female genitalia with mild clitoromegaly. The frequency is unknown, and children are sometimes misdiagnosed as having AIS.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.emedicine.com/ped/topic1980.htm |title=eMedicine article on 5-ARD |publisher=Emedicine.com |date=23 June 2009 |accessdate=21 August 2009 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081017193051/http://www.emedicine.com/ped/topic1980.htm |archivedate=17 October 2008 |df=dmy-all }}</ref> Individuals can have testes, as well as vagina and labia, and a small penis capable of ejaculation that looks like a clitoris at birth.

The child has a male body and an internal uterus and fallopian tubes because his body did not produce [[M\u00fcllerian inhibiting factor]] during fetal development.\n |-\n | XY || [[Anorchia]] || Individuals with XY chromosomes whose gonads were lost after 14 weeks of fetal development. People with anorchia have no ability to produce the hormones responsible for developing male secondary sex characteristics nor the means to produce [[gamete]]s necessary for reproduction due to the lack of gonads. They may develop typically feminine secondary sex characteristics without or despite the administration of androgens to artificially initiate physical sex differentiation (typically planned around the age of puberty). Psychological and neurological gender identity may solidify before the administration of androgens, leading to [[gender dysphoria]], as anorchic individuals are typically [[sex assignment|assigned male at birth]].\n |-\n|XY||Gonadal dysgenesis|| It has various causes and are not all genetic; a catch-all category. <br /> It refers to individuals (mostly XY) whose gonads don't develop properly.

Generally, a system of rent regulation involves:\n*[[Price controls]], limits on the rent that a landlord may charge, typically called '''rent control''' or '''rent stabilization'''\n*[[Eviction]] controls: codified standards by which a landlord may terminate a tenancy{{ r | MB_Law | p=1 | q=Rent Control Laws cannot exist without a coinciding Eviction Control ordinance. The reason being is that if a landlord has a tenant in a rent controlled unit who is paying below market rent, he/she is financially motivated to simply evict the tenant and reset the rent to market rate under the Costa Hawkins Act. Therefore Eviction Control is necessary in order to preserve Rent Controlled tenancies. }} {{ r | SFChronicle_RC_1 | p=1 | q=If a city only limited rent increases, landlords could simply evict tenants when their lease is up and charge the next one market rates.  Two state laws place some limits on both rent control and eviction control. The Costa-Hawkins Rental Housing Act exempts multifamily apartments built after 1 February 1995 \u2014 and all single-family homes and condos, whenever built \u2014 from limits on rent increases. Costa-Hawkins does not prevent cities from imposing eviction controls on any type of rental housing \u2014 including single-family homes and apartments of any age. [This source and quote is included to clarify the difference between rent control and eviction control, and that eviction control laws can (and do) exist separately from and without rent control laws, whereas the converse is not true.] }}\n*obligations on the landlord or tenant regarding adequate maintenance of the property\n*a system of oversight and enforcement by an independent regulator and [[Ombudsman]]\n\nThe loose term \"rent control\" covers a spectrum of regulation which can vary from setting the absolute amount of rent that can be charged, with no allowed increases, to placing different limits on the amount that rent can increase; these restrictions may continue between tenancies, or may be applied only within the duration of a tenancy.<ref>See the section on [[Rent regulation#Forms of rent regulation]] for more detail.</ref> As of 2016, at least 14 of the 36 [[OECD]] countries have some form of rent control in effect,{{r | OECD_RC }} including four states in the United States.{{r | NMHC | Landlord_com }}\n\nRent regulation is one of several classes of policies proposed to improve [[housing affordability]], alongside [[Subsidized housing|subsidies]] (including [[Housing voucher|vouchers]] and [[tax credit]]s) and policies aimed at expanding the [[housing supply]].{{r | lightning-rod }} There is a consensus among economists that rent control reduces the quality and quantity of housing.<ref>See the [[Rent regulation#Economists' views|Economists' views]] section for the references supporting this statement.</ref>\n\n== Forms of rent regulation ==\nThe loose term \"rent control\" can apply to several types of price control:\n* \"strict price ceilings\", also known as ''rent freeze'' systems, or ''absolute'' or ''first generation'' rent controls, in which no increases in rent are allowed at all (rent is typically frozen at the rate existing when the law was enacted) \n* \"vacancy control\", also known as ''strict'' or ''strong'' rent control, in which the rental price can rise, but continues to be regulated in between tenancies (a new [[Leasehold estate|tenant]] pays almost the same rent as the previous tenant) and \n* \"vacancy decontrol\", also known as ''tenancy'' or ''second-generation'' rent control, which limits price increases during a tenancy, but allows rents to rise to market rate between tenancies (new tenants pay market rate rent, but increases are limited as long as they remain).{{ r | GPG }}\n\n== Economics ==\n=== Theory ===\n{{see also|Freedom of contract|Inequality of bargaining power}}\n{{quote box|bgcolor=#c6dbf7|width=22em|align=right|salign=right|quote=\"As soon as the land of any country has all become private property, the landlords, like all other men, love to reap where they never sowed, and demand a rent even for its natural produce.

Generally, a system of rent regulation involves:\n*[[Price controls]], limits on the rent that a landlord may charge, typically called '''rent control''' or '''rent stabilization'''\n*[[Eviction]] controls: codified standards by which a landlord may terminate a tenancy{{ r | MB_Law | p=1 | q=Rent Control Laws cannot exist without a coinciding Eviction Control ordinance. The reason being is that if a landlord has a tenant in a rent controlled unit who is paying below market rent, he/she is financially motivated to simply evict the tenant and reset the rent to market rate under the Costa Hawkins Act. Therefore Eviction Control is necessary in order to preserve Rent Controlled tenancies. }} {{ r | SFChronicle_RC_1 | p=1 | q=If a city only limited rent increases, landlords could simply evict tenants when their lease is up and charge the next one market rates.  Two state laws place some limits on both rent control and eviction control. The Costa-Hawkins Rental Housing Act exempts multifamily apartments built after 1 February 1995 \u2014 and all single-family homes and condos, whenever built \u2014 from limits on rent increases. Costa-Hawkins does not prevent cities from imposing eviction controls on any type of rental housing \u2014 including single-family homes and apartments of any age. [This source and quote is included to clarify the difference between rent control and eviction control, and that eviction control laws can (and do) exist separately from and without rent control laws, whereas the converse is not true.] }}\n*obligations on the landlord or tenant regarding adequate maintenance of the property\n*a system of oversight and enforcement by an independent regulator and [[Ombudsman]]\n\nThe loose term \"rent control\" covers a spectrum of regulation which can vary from setting the absolute amount of rent that can be charged, with no allowed increases, to placing different limits on the amount that rent can increase; these restrictions may continue between tenancies, or may be applied only within the duration of a tenancy.<ref>See the section on [[Rent regulation#Forms of rent regulation]] for more detail.</ref> As of 2016, at least 14 of the 36 [[OECD]] countries have some form of rent control in effect,{{r | OECD_RC }} including four states in the United States.{{r | NMHC | Landlord_com }}\n\nRent regulation is one of several classes of policies proposed to improve [[housing affordability]], alongside [[Subsidized housing|subsidies]] (including [[Housing voucher|vouchers]] and [[tax credit]]s) and policies aimed at expanding the [[housing supply]].{{r | lightning-rod }} There is a consensus among economists that rent control reduces the quality and quantity of housing.<ref>See the [[Rent regulation#Economists' views|Economists' views]] section for the references supporting this statement.</ref>\n\n== Forms of rent regulation ==\nThe loose term \"rent control\" can apply to several types of price control:\n* \"strict price ceilings\", also known as ''rent freeze'' systems, or ''absolute'' or ''first generation'' rent controls, in which no increases in rent are allowed at all (rent is typically frozen at the rate existing when the law was enacted) \n* \"vacancy control\", also known as ''strict'' or ''strong'' rent control, in which the rental price can rise, but continues to be regulated in between tenancies (a new [[Leasehold estate|tenant]] pays almost the same rent as the previous tenant) and \n* \"vacancy decontrol\", also known as ''tenancy'' or ''second-generation'' rent control, which limits price increases during a tenancy, but allows rents to rise to market rate between tenancies (new tenants pay market rate rent, but increases are limited as long as they remain).{{ r | GPG }}\n\n== Economics ==\n=== Theory ===\n{{see also|Freedom of contract|Inequality of bargaining power}}\n{{quote box|bgcolor=#c6dbf7|width=22em|align=right|salign=right|quote=\"As soon as the land of any country has all become private property, the landlords, like all other men, love to reap where they never sowed, and demand a rent even for its natural produce.
