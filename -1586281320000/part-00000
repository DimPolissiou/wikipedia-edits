{"title_page": "Dynamo Duck", "text_new": "'''Dynamo Duck'''  ({{lang-fr|Saturnin le canard}}) was the main character in the children's series ''The Adventures of Dynamo Duck'', which aired on television in the early 1990s.\n\n==Overview==\nThe origin of the series lies with the French film maker [[Jean Tourane]]. During the 1960s, he filmed for a children's television series ''Saturnin le canard'' about the [[duckling]] Saturnin who had all kinds of adventures. The series was produced using real animals, dressed up with sunglasses, hats, etcetera, inside a miniature world. The series, first produced in 1964 (according to the [[Internet Movie Database]]) was shown on French television.\n\nYears later, the footage was bought by the American producer [[Nathan Sassover]]. Originally, clips of it were used as [[Bumper (broadcasting)|bumpers]] leading into and out of commercials on the [[Fox Kids]] network. Later, Sassover had the different pieces of film edited in a new way and hired writers to create new characters and storylines to produce a ''[[James Bond]]''-style show in a series of two-minute shorts. Again a small duck was the main character, fighting crimes of the evil Dr. Mortek (a monkey) and other assorted villains. The animals wander around on miniature sets with scale models of trucks and other vehicles. The duck, this time going by the name of \"Dynamo Duck\", was driving around in a miniature Jaguar.\n\nWhat makes this series unique prior to the advent of computer animation was the way the mouth movements of the animals, specifically the ducks, with the precise dialog dubbed in gives the appearance of the animals speaking.  The principal duckling was voiced-over by [[Dan Castellaneta]], using a terse, clipped style parodying ''[[The Untouchables (1959 TV series)|The Untouchables]]'''  [[Robert Stack]]. The first season aired in 1991 on [[Fox Kids]]. The shorts aired once a week during the Fox Kids' Saturday morning line-up in between the half-hour programs.  Where it appeared on the schedule wasn't announced and aired at inconsistent times.  Even the [[Promo (media)|promo]] for the series narrated by Dynamo says ''\"Saturday mornings on FOX\"'', but no specific time ever revealed. For fans to follow and collect the series, it was often necessary to record the entire morning line-up so as not to miss it.  At the end of every show, Dynamo Duck said ''\"We take care of our animals, and so should you!\"''. The second season of Dynamo Duck is widely regarded as vastly inferior to the first that relied more heavily on reuse of footage, and recycled storylines.  Dynamo's voice-over was modified in a manner similar to [[Don Adams]]' ''[[Get Smart]]'' role of [[Maxwell Smart]].  There are over 100 shorts in the series.\n\nLater, in the mid-1990s, the series had a brief afterlife airing overnights on the now defunct [[Network One]] (N1).  The episodes were five minutes in length, including end credits.  Many of which were expansions of their two-minute counterparts from Fox Kids.  Some combined two two-minute shorts to make a five-minute double episode with bridges either at the beginning, middle or end of each story, or a combination thereof.  Due to the limited number of indie and low-powered stations that carried Network One, the series aired nearly unnoticed except by night owls.\n\nThe scoring was provided by a number of composers often multiple people on the same shorts, including:\nThomas Chase,\nSteve Rucker,\nNathan Sassover,\nPaul Menichini,\nMisho Segal,\nPeter Frampton,\n''et al.''\n\n== The characters and their roles ==\nDynamo Duck is the top secret agent of D.U.X., which stands for ''Dynamic Undercover Excellence''. Dynamo's nemesis, Dr. Mortek, is the leader of S.K.U.Z., which is ''Sleazy Killers, Usurpers, and Zealots''.  It was also referred to as the ''Society of Killers, Usurpers and Zealots''.  Many other crime and espionage organizations were known by their acronyms.  Such as H.O.A.X. (''the Horrible Organization Against Excellence''), S.N.O.B. (''the Secret Nefarious Order of Blowhards''), Y.A.H.O.O. (''Yokels Against Happiness, Optimism and Order''), G.O.O.F.U.S. (''Goons On the Orders to Foul Up Society''), T.O.X.I.C. (''Totally Obnoxious, Extremely Insidious Criminals''), W.H.O.M. (''Wiley Horrendous Obnoxious Maniacs''), L.U.S.H. (''Low, Underhanded Sot-faced Hitmen''), and S.N.O.R.E. (''Slumbering Nemesis Of Righteousness Everywhere'').  The Loonies are a religious cult living like medieval knights.  Loonies is not an acronym.  Many of the agents working for these organizations were, but not limited to, weasels.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! Good guys\n! Title\n!

{"title_page": "Lexical semantics", "text_new": "{{linguistics}}\n'''Lexical semantics''' (also known as '''lexicosemantics'''), is a subfield of [[linguistics|linguistic]] [[semantics]]. The units of analysis in lexical semantics are lexical units which include not only words but also sub-words or sub-units such as [[affix]]es and even compound words and phrases. Lexical units make up the catalogue of words in a language, the [[lexicon]]. Lexical semantics looks at how the meaning of the lexical units correlates with the structure of the language or [[syntax]]. This is referred to as syntax-semantic interface.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Pustejovsky|first1=James|title=The Generative Lexicon|date=1995|publisher=MIT Press|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=p2GJBNpBVg4C&printsec=frontcover#v=snippet&q=%22lexical%20semantics%22&f=false|isbn=9780262661409}}</ref>\n\nThe study of lexical semantics looks at:\n* the classification and decomposition of lexical items\n* the differences and similarities in lexical semantic structure cross-linguistically\n* the relationship of lexical meaning to [[Sentence (linguistics)|sentence]] meaning and [[syntax]].\n\nLexical units, also referred to as syntactic atoms, can stand alone such as in the case of root words or parts of compound words or they necessarily attach to other units such as prefixes and suffixes do. The former are called [[free morpheme]]s and the latter [[bound morpheme]]s.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Di Sciullo|first1=Anne-Marie|last2=Williams|first2=Edwin|title=On the definition of word|url=https://archive.org/details/ondefinitionofwo00disc|url-access=registration|date=1987|publisher=MIT press|location=Cambridge, MA}}</ref> They fall into a narrow range of meanings ([[semantic field]]s) and can combine with each other to generate new denotations.\n\n=={{anchor|Lexical relations}} Lexical relations: how meanings relate to each other ==\nLexical items contain information about category (lexical and syntactic), form and meaning. The semantics related to these categories then relate to each lexical item in the [[lexicon]].<ref name=\"Glossary\" /> Lexical items can also be semantically classified based on whether their meanings are derived from single lexical units or from their surrounding environment.\n\nLexical items participate in regular patterns of association with each other. Some relations between lexical items include [[Hyponymy and hypernymy|hyponymy, hypernymy]], [[synonym]]y, and [[antonym]]y, as well as [[homonym]]y.<ref name=\"Glossary\">{{cite web|last1=Loos|first1=Eugene|last2=Anderson|first2=Susan|last3=H.

They fall under the general term of ''color'', which is the hypernym.\n[[File:Colortaxonomy.png|thumb|Taxonomy showing the hypernym \"color\"]]\n{|\n|-\n| \n ''Color (hypernym) \u2192 red, green, yellow, blue (hyponyms)''\n|}\n\nHyponyms and hypernyms can be described by using a [[Taxonomy (general)|taxonomy]], as seen in the example.\n\n=== Synonymy ===\n[[Synonymy]] refers to words that are pronounced and spelled differently but contain the same meaning.\n{|\n|-\n|  \n ''Happy, joyful, glad <ref name=\"Glossary\" />''''\n|}\n\n=== Antonymy ===\n[[Antonymy]] refers to words that are related by having the opposite meanings to each other.\nThere are three types of antonyms: [[Opposite (semantics)#Gradable antonyms|graded antonyms]], [[Opposite (semantics)#Complementary antonyms|complementary antonyms]], and [[Converse (semantics)|relational antonyms]].\n{|\n|-\n|  \n ''dead, alive <ref name=\"Glossary\" />\n ''long, short ''\n|}\n\n=== Homonymy ===\n[[Homonymy]] refers to the relationship between words that are spelled or  pronounced the same way but hold different meanings.\n{|\n|-\n|  \n ''bank (of river)\n ''bank (financial institution)''\n|}\n[[File:Semantic Net.svg|thumb|An example of a semantic network]]\n\n=== Semantic networks ===\nLexical semantics also explores whether the meaning of a lexical unit is established by looking at its neighbourhood in the [[Semantic network|semantic net]], (words it occurs with in natural sentences), or whether the meaning is already locally contained in the lexical unit.\n\nIn English, [[WordNet]] is an example of a semantic network. It contains English words that are grouped into [[Synonym Ring|synsets]]. Some semantic relations between these synsets are [[meronymy]], [[hyponymy]], [[synonymy]], and [[antonymy]].\n\n== Semantic fields ==\n\n=== How lexical items map onto concepts ===\nFirst proposed by Trier in the 1930s,<ref name=famer1999>Famer, Pamela B.; Mairal Us\u00f3n, Ricardo (1999). \"Constructing a Lexicon of English Verbs\". Functional Grammar (in English) 23 (illustrated ed.). Walter de Gruyter. p. 350. {{ISBN|9783110164169}}.</ref> [[semantic field]] theory proposes that a group of words with interrelated meanings can be categorized under a larger conceptual domain. This entire entity is thereby known as a semantic field. The words ''boil'', ''bake'', ''fry'', and ''roast'', for example, would fall under the larger semantic category of ''cooking''. Semantic field theory asserts that lexical meaning cannot be fully understood by looking at a word in isolation, but by looking at a group of semantically related words.<ref>{{cite book|first=Adrienne|last=Lehrer|title=Historical Semantics, Historical Word Formation|chapter=The influence of semantic fields on semantic change|publisher=Walter de Gruyter|date=1985|pages=283\u2013296 |chapter-url=http://alehrer.faculty.arizona.edu/sites/alehrer.faculty.arizona.edu/files/Semantic%20fields%20and%20change.pdf}}</ref> Semantic relations can refer to any relationship in meaning between [[lexeme]]s, including synonymy ''(big'' and ''large),'' antonymy ''(big'' and ''small),'' hypernymy and hyponymy ''(rose'' and ''flower),'' converseness ''(buy'' and ''sell),'' and incompatibility. Semantic field theory does not have concrete guidelines that determine the extent of semantic relations between lexemes. The abstract validity of the theory is a subject of debate.<ref name=famer1999 />\n\nKnowing the meaning of a lexical item therefore means knowing the semantic entailments the word brings with it. However, it is also possible to understand only one word of a semantic field without understanding other related words. Take, for example, a taxonomy of plants and animals: it is possible to understand the words ''rose'' and ''rabbit'' without knowing what a ''marigold'' or a ''muskrat'' is. This is applicable to colors as well, such as understanding the word ''red'' without knowing the meaning of ''scarlet,'' but understanding ''scarlet'' without knowing the meaning of ''red'' may be less likely. A semantic field can thus be very large or very small, depending on the level of contrast being made between lexical items. While cat and dog both fall under the larger semantic field of animal, including the breed of dog, like ''German shepherd,'' would require contrasts between other breeds of dog (e.g. ''corgi'', or ''poodle''), thus expanding the semantic field further.<ref>{{cite book\n | last = Grandy\n | first = Richard E.\n | title = Frames, Fields, and Contrasts: New Essays in Semantic and Lexical Organization\n | publisher = Routledge\n | date = 2012\n | chapter = Semantic Fields, Prototypes, and the Lexicon\n | pages = 103\u2013122\n | isbn = 9781136475801}}</ref>\n\n=== How lexical items map onto events ===\nEvent structure is defined as the semantic relation of a verb and its syntactic properties.<ref>\n {{Citation\n | last = Malaia\n | title =Effects of Verbal Event Structure on Online Thematic Role Assignment\n | journal =Journal of Psycholinguistic Research\n | volume =41\n | issue =5\n | pages =323\u2013345\n | year =2012\n | doi =10.1007/s10936-011-9195-x| pmid =22120140\n |display-authors=etal}}</ref>\nEvent structure has three primary components:<ref name=Pustejovsky>{{cite journal | last1 = Pustejovsky | first1 = James | year = 2012 | title = The syntax of event structure | url = http://www.cs.rochester.edu/u/james/Papers/Pustejovsky-event-structure.pdf | journal = Cognition | volume = 41 | issue = 1\u20133| pages = 47\u201381 | doi = 10.1016/0010-0277(91)90032-y | pmid = 1790655 }}</ref>\n* primitive event type of the lexical item\n* event composition rules\n* mapping rules to lexical structure\nVerbs can belong to one of three types: states, processes, or transitions.\n{|\n|-\n| \n ''(1) a.

The term ''generative linguistics'' was based on Chomsky's [[generative grammar]], a linguistic theory that states systematic sets of rules ([[X' theory]])  can predict grammatical phrases within a natural language.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Chomsky|first1=Noam|title=Syntactic Structures|date=1957|publisher=Mouton de Gruyter}}</ref> Generative Linguistics is also known as Government-Binding Theory.\nGenerative linguists of the 1960s, including [[Noam Chomsky]] and [[Ernst von Glasersfeld]], believed semantic relations between [[transitive verbs]] and [[intransitive verbs]] were tied to their independent syntactic organization.<ref name=\"WILEY Blackwell\"/> This meant that they saw a simple verb phrase as encompassing a more complex syntactic structure.<ref name=\"WILEY Blackwell\"/>\n\n=== Lexicalist theories in the 1980s ===\nLexicalist theories became popular during the 1980s, and emphasized that a word's internal structure was a question of [[morphology (linguistics)|morphology]] and not of [[syntax]].<ref name=ReferenceA>{{cite journal|last1=Scalise|first1=Sergio|last2=Guevara|first2=Emiliano|title=The Lexicalist Approach to Word-Formation|date=1985}}</ref> Lexicalist theories emphasized that complex words (resulting from compounding and derivation of [[affixes]]) have lexical entries that are derived from morphology, rather than resulting from overlapping syntactic and phonological properties, as Generative Linguistics predicts. The distinction between Generative Linguistics and Lexicalist theories can be illustrated by considering the transformation of the word ''destroy'' to ''destruction'':\n\n* '''Generative Linguistics theory''': states the transformation of ''destroy'' \u2192 ''destruction'' as the nominal, ''nom'' + ''destroy,'' combined with [[phonological rule]]s that produce the output ''destruction''. Views this transformation as independent of the morphology.\n* '''Lexicalist theory''': sees ''destroy'' and ''destruction'' as having idiosyncratic lexical entries based on their differences in morphology. Argues that each morpheme contributes specific meaning. States that the formation of the complex word ''destruction'' is accounted for by a set of ''Lexical Rules,'' which are different and independent from syntactic rules.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/>\n\nA [[lexical entry]] lists the basic properties of either the whole word, or the individual properties of the morphemes that make up the word itself. The properties of [[lexical item]]s include their category selection ''c-selection'', selectional properties ''s-selection'', (also known as semantic selection),<ref name=\"WILEY Blackwell\"/> phonological properties, and features. The properties of lexical items are idiosyncratic, unpredictable, and contain specific information about the lexical items that they describe.<ref name=\"WILEY Blackwell\"/>\n\nThe following is an example of a lexical entry for the verb ''put'':\n{|\n|-\n| \n ''put:'' V DP<sub>''agent''</sub> DP<sub>''experiencer''</sub>/PP<sub>''locative''</sub>\n|}\n\nLexicalist theories state that a word's meaning is derived from its morphology or a speaker's lexicon, and not its syntax. The degree of morphology's influence on overall grammar remains controversial.<ref name=\"WILEY Blackwell\"/> Currently, the linguists that perceive one engine driving both morphological items and syntactic items are in the majority.\n\n=== Micro-syntactic theories: 1990s to the present ===\nBy the early 1990s, Chomsky's [[Minimalist program|minimalist framework]] on language structure led to sophisticated probing techniques for investigating languages.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Fodor|first1=Jerry|last2=Lepore|first2=Ernie|date=Aug 1999|journal=The Journal of Philosophy|volume=96|issue=8|pages=381\u2013403|jstor=2564628|doi=10.5840/jphil199996818|title=All at Sea in Semantic Space|url=https://semanticscholar.org/paper/b71ab3386f6eb9fbf5e855fa4cf4b80d9dc3b268}}</ref> These probing techniques analyzed negative data over [[prescriptive grammar]]s, and because of Chomsky's proposed Extended Projection Principle in 1986, probing techniques showed where specifiers of a sentence had moved to in order to fulfill the EPP. This allowed syntacticians to hypothesize that lexical items with complex syntactic features (such as [[Ditransitive verb|ditransitive]], [[inchoative verb|inchoative]], and [[causative verb|causative]] verbs), could select their own specifier element within a [[Concrete syntax tree|syntax tree]] construction. (For more on probing techniques, see Suci, G., Gammon, P., & Gamlin, P. (1979)).\n\nThis brought the focus back on the syntax-lexical semantics interface; however, syntacticians still sought to understand the relationship between complex verbs and their related syntactic structure, and to what degree the syntax was projected from the lexicon, as the Lexicalist theories argued.\n\nIn the mid 1990s, linguists [[Heidi Harley]], [[Samuel Jay Keyser]], and [[Kenneth L. Hale|Kenneth Hale]] addressed some of the implications posed by complex verbs and a lexically-derived syntax. Their proposals indicated that the predicates CAUSE and BECOME, referred to as subunits within a Verb Phrase, acted as a lexical semantic template.<ref>Pinker, S. 1989. \"Learnability and Cognition: The Acquisition of Argument Structure.\" Cambridge. MIT Press. pp 89</ref> ''Predicates'' are verbs and state or affirm something about the subject of the sentence or the argument of the sentence. For example, the predicates ''went'' and ''is here'' below affirm the argument of the subject and the state of the subject respectively.\n\n{|\n|-\n| \n ''Lucy went home.\n ''The parcel is here.''\n|}\n\nThe subunits of Verb Phrases led to the Argument Structure Hypothesis and Verb Phrase Hypothesis, both outlined below.<ref>Harley, Heidi. \"Events, agents and the interpretation of VP-shells.\" (1996).</ref> The recursion found under the \"umbrella\" Verb Phrase, the VP Shell, accommodated binary-branching theory; another critical topic during the 1990s.<ref>Kayne, Richard S.

Hale|Kenneth Hale]] and [[Samuel Jay Keyser]] introduced their thesis on lexical argument structure during the early 1990s.<ref name=\"Hale\">{{cite journal|last1=Hale|first1=Kenneth|last2=Keyser|first2=Samuel Jay|title=On Argument Structures and the Lexical expression of syntactic relations|journal=Essays in Linguistics in Honor of Sylvain Bromberger|date=1993}}</ref>\nThey argue that a predicate's argument structure is represented in the syntax, and that the syntactic representation of the predicate is a lexical projection of its arguments. Thus, the structure of a predicate is strictly a lexical representation, where each phrasal head projects its argument onto a phrasal level within the syntax tree. The selection of this phrasal head is based on Chomsky's Empty Category Principle. This lexical projection of the predicate's argument onto the syntactic structure is the foundation for the Argument Structure Hypothesis.<ref name=\"Hale\" /> This idea coincides with Chomsky's [[Projection Principle]], because it forces a VP to be selected locally and be selected by a Tense Phrase (TP).\n\nBased on the interaction between lexical properties, locality, and the properties of the EPP (where a phrasal head selects another phrasal element locally), Hale and Keyser make the claim that the Specifier position or a complement are the only two semantic relations that project a predicate's argument. In 2003, Hale and Keyser put forward this hypothesis and argued that a lexical unit must have one or the other, Specifier or Complement, but cannot have both.<ref>Paul Bennett, 2003.

Essentially, the idea that under the Extended Projection Principle there is a local boundary under which a special meaning occurs. This meaning can only occur if a head-projecting morpheme is present within the local domain of the syntactic structure.<ref name=\"Marantz\">Marantz, Alec. 1997.

This branching ensures that the Specifier is the consistently subject, even when investigating the projection of a complex verb's lexical entry and its corresponding syntactic construction. This generalization is also present in Ramchand's theory that the complement of a head for a complex verb phrase must co-describe the verb's event.\n\nRamchand also introduced the concept of Homomorphic Unity, which refers to the structural synchronization between the head of a complex verb phrase and its complement. According to Ramchand, Homomorphic Unity is \"when two event descriptors are syntactically Merged, the structure of the complement must unify with the structure of the head.\"<ref name=Ramchand>{{cite book|last1=Ramchand|first1=Gillian|title=Verb Meaning and the Lexicon: A First Phase Syntax|date=2008|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=9780511486319}}</ref>\n\n== Classification of event types ==\n\n=== Intransitive verbs: unaccusative versus unergative ===\n{{multiple image\n| align = right\n| direction = horizontal\n| header =\n| width = 100\n\n| image1 = Unaccusativeexample.png\n|thumb\n| caption1 = Underlying tree structure for (2a)\n\n| image2 = Unergativeexample.png\n|thumb\n| caption2 = Underlying tree structure for (2b)\n\n}}\n\nThe unaccusative hypothesis was put forward by David Perlmutter in 1987, and describes how two classes of intransitive verbs have two different syntactic structures. These are [[unaccusative verb]]s and [[unergative verb]]s.<ref name=\"Lappin\">Lappin, S. (Ed.). (1996). Handbook of contemporary semantic theory.

(For example, the VP ''the vase broke'' carries a change-of-state meaning of the vase becoming broken, and thus has a silent BECOME subunit within its underlying structure.) There are two types of change-of-state predicates: [[inchoative]] and [[causative]].\n\nInchoative verbs are [[Intransitive verb|intransitive]], meaning that they occur without a direct object, and these verbs express that their subject has undergone a certain change of state. Inchoative verbs are also known as [[anticausative]] verbs.<ref name=\"An Overview of Lexical Semantics\">{{cite journal|last1=Johnson|first1=Kent|title=An Overview of Lexical Semantics|journal=Philosophy Compass|date=2008|pages=119\u2013134|url=http://www.lps.uci.edu/~johnsonk/Publications/Johnson.AnOverviewOfLexicalSemantics.pdf}}</ref> Causative verbs are transitive, meaning that they occur with a direct object, and they express that the subject causes a change of state in the object.\n\nLinguist [[Martin Haspelmath]] classifies inchoative/causative verb pairs under three main categories: causative, anticausative, and non-directed alternations.<ref name=\"Haspelmath1\">{{cite book|last1=Haspelmath|first1=Martin|title=More on the typology of inchoative/causative verb alternations|journal=Causatives and Transitivity|date=1993|volume=23|pages=87\u2013121|url=https://www.academia.edu/3452966|doi=10.1075/slcs.23.05has|series=Studies in Language Companion Series|isbn=978-90-272-3026-3}}</ref> Non-directed alternations are further subdivided into labile, equipollent, and suppletive alternations.\n{{multiple image\n| align = right\n| direction = horizontal\n| header =\n| width = 160\n\n| image1 = Vasebreak.png\n|thumb\n| caption1 = Underlying tree structure for (3a)\n\n| image2 = Johnbrokevase.png\n|thumb\n| caption2 = Underlying tree structure for (3b)\n\n}}\n[[English language|English]] tends to favour [[Ambitransitive verb|labile alternations]],<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Pi\u00f1\u00f3n|first1=Christopher|title=A finer look at the causative-inchoative alternation|date=2001|pages=346\u2013364|url=http://elanguage.net/journals/salt/article/viewFile/11.346/1719}}</ref> meaning that the same verb is used in the inchoative and causative forms.<ref name=\"Haspelmath1\" /> This can be seen in the following example: ''broke'' is an intransitive inchoative verb in (3a) and a transitive causative verb in (3b).\n{|\n|-\n| \n (3) '''English''' <ref name=\"An Overview of Lexical Semantics\" />\n     a.

In the underlying tree structure for (3b), the silent subunits CAUS and BECOME are both embedded within the VP, resulting in the causative change-of-state meaning (x cause y become z).<ref name=\"WILEY Blackwell\" />\n\nEnglish change of state verbs are often de-adjectival, meaning that they are derived from adjectives. We can see this in the following example:\n{|\n|-\n| \n (4) a.

In (4c) we see a transitive causative verb.\n\n==== Marked inchoatives ====\nSome languages (e.g., [[German language|German]], [[Italian language|Italian]], and [[French language|French]]), have multiple morphological classes of inchoative verbs.<ref name=\"Schafer\">{{cite book|last1=Schafer|first1=Florian|title=The Syntax of (Anti-)Causatives|publisher=John Benjamins Publishing Company|isbn=9789027255099|page=1|year=2008}}</ref> Generally speaking, these languages separate their inchoative verbs into three classes: verbs that are obligatorily unmarked (they are not marked with a [[reflexive pronoun]], [[clitic]], or [[affix]]), verbs that are optionally marked, and verbs that are obligatorily marked. The causative verbs in these languages remain unmarked. [[Martin Haspelmath|Haspelmath]] refers to this as the [[anticausative]] alternation.\n{{multiple image\n| align = right\n| direction = horizontal\n| header =\n| width = 170\n\n| image1 = Zerbrach.png\n|thumb\n| caption1 = Underlying tree structure for (4a)\n\n| image2 = Hanszerbrach.png\n|thumb\n| caption2 = Underlying tree structure for (4b)\n\n}}\nFor example, inchoative verbs in [[German language|German]] are classified into three morphological classes. ''Class A'' verbs necessarily form inchoatives with the reflexive pronoun ''{{lang|de|sich}}'', ''Class B'' verbs form inchoatives necessarily without the reflexive pronoun, and ''Class C'' verbs form inchoatives optionally with or without the reflexive pronoun. In example (5), the verb ''{{lang|de|zerbrach}}'' is an unmarked inchoative verb from ''Class B'', which also remains unmarked in its causative form.<ref name=\"Schafer\" />\n{|\n|-\n| \n (5) '''German'''  <ref name=\"Schafer\" />\n     a.

''Hans '''\u00f6ffnete''' die T\u00fcr.''\n        John opened the door\n        'John opened the door.'\n|}\n\nThere has been some debate as to whether the different classes of inchoative verbs are purely based in morphology, or whether the differentiation is derived from the lexical-semantic properties of each individual verb. While this debate is still unresolved in languages such as [[Italian language|Italian]], [[French language|French]], and [[Greek language|Greek]], it has been suggested by linguist Florian Sch\u00e4fer that there are semantic differences between marked and unmarked inchoatives in [[German language|German]]. Specifically, that only unmarked inchoative verbs allow an unintentional causer reading (meaning that they can take on an \"''x unintentionally caused y''\" reading).<ref name=\"Schafer\" />\n\n==== Marked causatives ====\n{{multiple image\n| align = right\n| direction = horizontal\n| header =\n| width = 190\n\n| image1 = angbata.png\n|thumb\n| caption1 = Underlying tree structure for (7a)\n\n| image2 = sirosa2.png\n|thumb\n| caption2 = Underlying tree structure for (7b)\n\n}}\nCausative morphemes are present in the verbs of many languages (e.g., [[Tagalog language|Tagalog]], [[Malagasy language|Malagasy]], [[Turkish language|Turkish]], etc.), usually appearing in the form of an affix on the verb.<ref name=\"An Overview of Lexical Semantics\" /> This can be seen in the following examples from [[Tagalog language|Tagalog]], where the causative prefix ''pag-'' (realized here as ''nag'') attaches to the verb ''tumba'' to derive a causative transitive verb in (7b), but the prefix does not appear in the inchoative intransitive verb in (7a). [[Martin Haspelmath|Haspelmath]] refers to this as the [[causative]] alternation.\n{|\n|-\n| \n (7) '''Tagalog''' <ref name=\"An Overview of Lexical Semantics\" />\n     a.

The idea of unambiguous paths stated that an antecedent and an anaphor should be connected via an unambiguous path. This means that the line connecting an antecedent and an anaphor cannot be broken by another argument.<ref name=\"Kayne\">Kayne, R. (1981). Unambiguous paths. In R. May & F. Koster (Eds.), Levels of syntactic representation (143-184). Cinnaminson, NJ: Foris Publications.</ref> When applied to ditransitive verbs, this hypothesis introduces the structure in diagram (8a). In this tree structure it can be seen that the same path can be traced from either DP to the verb. Tree diagram (7b) illustrates this structure with an example from English. This analysis was a step toward binary branching trees, which was a theoretical change that was furthered by Larson's VP-shell analysis.<ref name=\"Larson\" />\n\n==== Larson's 1988 \"VP-shell\" analysis ====\n{{multiple image\n| align = right\n| direction = horizontal\n| header =\n| width = 170\n\n| image1 = LexicalSemanticsDOCtree.png\n|thumb\n| caption1 = Tree diagram for (9a)\n\n| image2 = Lexicalsemantics7btree.png\n|thumb\n| caption2 = Tree diagram for (9b)\n\n}}\nLarson posited his Single Complement Hypothesis in which he stated that every complement is introduced with one verb. The Double Object Construction presented in 1988 gave clear evidence of a hierarchical structure using asymmetrical binary branching.<ref name=Larson>{{cite journal|last1=Larson|first1=Richard|title=On the Double Object Construction|journal=Linguistic Inquiry|date=1988|volume=19|issue=3|pages=589\u2013632|jstor=25164901}}</ref> Sentences with double objects occur with ditransitive verbs, as we can see in the following example:\n[[File:Vpshelltree.png|thumb|Larson's proposed binary-branching VP-shell structure for (9)]]\n{|\n|\n| \n (9) a. ''John sent Mary a package.'' <ref>{{cite journal|last1=Miyagawa|first1=Shigeru|last2=Tsujioka|first2=Takae|title=Argument Structure and Ditransitive Verbs in Japanese|journal=Journal of East Asian Linguistics|date=2004|volume=13|issue=1|pages=1\u201338|doi=10.1023/b:jeal.0000007345.64336.84|citeseerx=10.1.1.207.6553}}</ref>\n     b. ''John sent a package to Mary.''\n|}\nIt appears as if the verb ''send'' has two objects, or complements (arguments): both ''Mary'', the recipient and ''parcel'', the theme. The argument structure of ditransitive verb phrases is complex and has undergone different structural hypothesis.\n\nThe original structural hypothesis was that of ternary branching seen in (9a) and (9b), but following from Kayne's 1981 analysis, Larson maintained that each complement is introduced by a verb.<ref name=\"Kayne\" /><ref name=\"Larson\" />\n\nTheir hypothesis shows that there is a lower verb embedded within a VP shell that combines with an upper verb (can be invisible), thus creating a VP shell (as seen in the tree diagram to the right). Most current theories no longer allow the ternary tree structure of (9a) and (9b), so the theme and the goal/recipient are seen in a hierarchical relationship within a [[Branching (linguistics)#Binary vs. n-ary branching|binary branching]] structure.<ref name=\"Bruening\">{{cite journal|last1=Bruening|first1=Benjamin|title=Ditransitive Asymmetries and a Theory of Idiom Formation|journal=Linguistic Inquiry|date=November 2010|volume=41|issue=4|pages=519\u2013562|doi=10.1162/LING_a_00012}}</ref>\n\nFollowing are examples of Larson's tests to show that the hierarchical (superior) order of any two objects aligns with a linear order, so that the second is governed (c-commanded) by the first.<ref name=\"Larson\"/> This is in keeping with X'Bar Theory of Phrase Structure Grammar, with Larson's tree structure using the empty Verb to which the V is raised.\n\nReflexives and reciprocals (anaphors) show this relationship in which they must be c-commanded by their antecedents, such that the (10a) is grammatical but (10b) is not:\n{|\n|-\n| \n (10) a. ''I showed Mary herself.<ref name=\"Larson\"/>\n     b. ''*I showed herself Mary.''\n|}\nA pronoun must have a quantifier as its antecedent:\n{|\n|-\n| \n (11) a. '' I gave every worker his paycheck.<ref name=\"Larson\"/>\n      b. ''*I gave its owner every paycheck.''\n|}\nQuestion words follow this order:\n{|\n|-\n| \n (12) a. ''Who did you give which paycheck? <ref name=\"Larson\"/>\n      b. ''*Which paycheck did you give who?''\n|}\n\nThe effect of negative polarity means that \"any\" must have a negative quantifier as an antecedent:\n[[File:Larsoncausative.png|thumb|General tree diagram for Larson's proposed underlying structure of a sentence with causative meaning]]\n{|\n|-\n| \n (13) a. ''I showed no one anything.<ref name=\"Larson\"/>\n      b. ''*I showed anyone nothing.''\n|}\nThese tests with ditransitive verbs that confirm c-command also confirm the presence of underlying or invisible causative verbs. In ditransitive verbs such as ''give someone something'', ''send someone something'', ''show someone something'' etc. there is an underlying causative meaning that is represented in the underlying structure. As seen in example in (9a) above, ''John sent Mary a package'', there is the underlying meaning that 'John \"caused\" Mary to have a package'.\n\nLarson proposed that both sentences in (9a) and (9b) share the same underlying structure and the difference on the surface lies in that the double object construction \"John sent Mary a package\" is derived by transformation from a NP plus PP construction \"John sent a package to Mary\".\n\n==== Beck & Johnson's 2004 double object construction ====\n\nBeck and Johnson, however, give evidence that the two underlying structures are not the same.<ref name=beck>{{cite journal|last1=Sigrid|first1=Beck|last2=Johnson|first2=Kyle|title=Double Objects Again|journal=Linguistic Inquiry|date=2004|volume=35|issue=1|pages=97\u2013124|url=http://people.umass.edu/partee/docs/Beck_and_Johnson_2004.pdf|doi=10.1162/002438904322793356}}</ref> In so doing, they also give further evidence of the presence of two VPs where the verb attaches to a causative verb. In examples (14a) and (b), each of the double object constructions are alternated with NP + PP constructions.\n{|\n|-\n| \n (14) a. ''Satoshi sent Tubingen the Damron Guide.<ref name=\"beck\" />\n      b. ''Satoshi sent the Damron Guide to T\u00fcbingen''.\n|}\nBeck and Johnson show that the object in (15a) has a different relation to the motion verb as it is not able to carry the meaning of HAVING which the possessor (9a) and (15a) can. In (15a), Satoshi is an animate possessor and so is caused to HAVE kisimen. The PP ''for Satoshi'' in (15b) is of a benefactive nature and does not necessarily carry this meaning of HAVE either.\n{|\n|-\n| \n (15) a. ''Thilo cooked Satoshi kisimen.<ref name=\"beck\" />\n      b. ''Thilo cooked kisimen for Satoshi''.\n|}\nThe underlying structures are therefore not the same. The differences lie in the semantics and the syntax of the sentences, in contrast to the transformational theory of Larson. Further evidence for the structural existence of VP shells with an invisible verbal unit is given in the application of the adjunct or modifier \"again\". Sentence (16) is ambiguous and looking into the two different meanings reveals a difference in structure.\n{|\n|-\n| \n (16) ''Sally opened the door again''.<ref name=\"beck\" />\n|}\n{{multiple image\n| align = right\n| direction = horizontal\n| header =\n| width = 150\n\n| image1 = Larson3.png\n|thumb\n| caption1 = Underlying tree structure for (17a)\n\n| image2 = Larson1.png\n|thumb\n| caption2 = Underlying tree structure for (17b)\n\n}}\nHowever, in (17a), it is clear that it was Sally who repeated the action of opening the door. In (17b), the event is in the door being opened and Sally may or may not have opened it previously. To render these two different meanings, \"again\" attaches to VPs in two different places, and thus describes two events with a purely structural change.\n{|\n|-\n| \n (17) a.

Some semantic relations between these synsets are [[meronymy]], [[hyponymy]], [[synonymy]], and [[antonymy]].\n\n== Semantic fields ==\n\n=== How lexical items map onto concepts ===\nFirst proposed by Trier in the 1930s,<ref name=famer1999>Famer, Pamela B.; Mairal Us\u00f3n, Ricardo (1999). \"Constructing a Lexicon of English Verbs\". Functional Grammar (in English) 23 (illustrated ed.). Walter de Gruyter. p. 350. {{ISBN|9783110164169}}.</ref> [[semantic field]] theory proposes that a group of words with interrelated meanings can be categorized under a larger conceptual domain. This entire entity is thereby known as a semantic field. The words ''boil'', ''bake'', ''fry'', and ''roast'', for example, would fall under the larger semantic category of ''cooking''. Semantic field theory asserts that lexical meaning cannot be fully understood by looking at a word in isolation, but by looking at a group of semantically related words.<ref>{{cite book|first=Adrienne|last=Lehrer|title=Historical Semantics, Historical Word Formation|chapter=The influence of semantic fields on semantic change|publisher=Walter de Gruyter|date=1985|pages=283\u2013296 |chapter-url=http://alehrer.faculty.arizona.edu/sites/alehrer.faculty.arizona.edu/files/Semantic%20fields%20and%20change.pdf}}</ref> Semantic relations can refer to any relationship in meaning between [[lexeme]]s, including synonymy ''(big'' and ''large),'' antonymy ''(big'' and ''small),'' hypernymy and hyponymy ''(rose'' and ''flower),'' converseness ''(buy'' and ''sell),'' and incompatibility. Semantic field theory does not have concrete guidelines that determine the extent of semantic relations between lexemes. The abstract validity of the theory is a subject of debate.<ref name=famer1999 />\n\nKnowing the meaning of a lexical item therefore means knowing the semantic entailments the word brings with it. However, it is also possible to understand only one word of a semantic field without understanding other related words. Take, for example, a taxonomy of plants and animals: it is possible to understand the words ''rose'' and ''rabbit'' without knowing what a ''marigold'' or a ''muskrat'' is. This is applicable to colors as well, such as understanding the word ''red'' without knowing the meaning of ''scarlet,'' but understanding ''scarlet'' without knowing the meaning of ''red'' may be less likely. A semantic field can thus be very large or very small, depending on the level of contrast being made between lexical items. While cat and dog both fall under the larger semantic field of animal, including the breed of dog, like ''German shepherd,'' would require contrasts between other breeds of dog (e.g. ''corgi'', or ''poodle''), thus expanding the semantic field further.<ref>{{cite book\n | last = Grandy\n | first = Richard E.\n | title = Frames, Fields, and Contrasts: New Essays in Semantic and Lexical Organization\n | publisher = Routledge\n | date = 2012\n | chapter = Semantic Fields, Prototypes, and the Lexicon\n | pages = 103\u2013122\n | isbn = 9781136475801}}</ref>\n\n=== How lexical items map onto events ===\nEvent structure is defined as the semantic relation of a verb and its syntactic properties.<ref>\n {{Citation\n | last = Malaia\n | title =Effects of Verbal Event Structure on Online Thematic Role Assignment\n | journal =Journal of Psycholinguistic Research\n | volume =41\n | issue =5\n | pages =323\u2013345\n | year =2012\n | doi =10.1007/s10936-011-9195-x| pmid =22120140\n |display-authors=etal}}</ref>\nEvent structure has three primary components:<ref name=Pustejovsky>{{cite journal | last1 = Pustejovsky | first1 = James | year = 2012 | title = The syntax of event structure | url = http://www.cs.rochester.edu/u/james/Papers/Pustejovsky-event-structure.pdf | journal = Cognition | volume = 41 | issue = 1\u20133| pages = 47\u201381 | doi = 10.1016/0010-0277(91)90032-y | pmid = 1790655 }}</ref>\n* primitive event type of the lexical item\n* event composition rules\n* mapping rules to lexical structure\nVerbs can belong to one of three types: states, processes, or transitions.\n{|\n|-\n| \n ''(1) a.

The term ''generative linguistics'' was based on Chomsky's [[generative grammar]], a linguistic theory that states systematic sets of rules ([[X' theory]])  can predict grammatical phrases within a natural language.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Chomsky|first1=Noam|title=Syntactic Structures|date=1957|publisher=Mouton de Gruyter}}</ref> Generative Linguistics is also known as Government-Binding Theory.\nGenerative linguists of the 1960s, including [[Noam Chomsky]] and [[Ernst von Glasersfeld]], believed semantic relations between [[transitive verbs]] and [[intransitive verbs]] were tied to their independent syntactic organization.<ref name=\"WILEY Blackwell\"/> This meant that they saw a simple verb phrase as encompassing a more complex syntactic structure.<ref name=\"WILEY Blackwell\"/>\n\n=== Lexicalist theories in the 1980s ===\nLexicalist theories became popular during the 1980s, and emphasized that a word's internal structure was a question of [[morphology (linguistics)|morphology]] and not of [[syntax]].<ref name=ReferenceA>{{cite journal|last1=Scalise|first1=Sergio|last2=Guevara|first2=Emiliano|title=The Lexicalist Approach to Word-Formation|date=1985}}</ref> Lexicalist theories emphasized that complex words (resulting from compounding and derivation of [[affixes]]) have lexical entries that are derived from morphology, rather than resulting from overlapping syntactic and phonological properties, as Generative Linguistics predicts. The distinction between Generative Linguistics and Lexicalist theories can be illustrated by considering the transformation of the word ''destroy'' to ''destruction'':\n\n* '''Generative Linguistics theory''': states the transformation of ''destroy'' \u2192 ''destruction'' as the nominal, ''nom'' + ''destroy,'' combined with [[phonological rule]]s that produce the output ''destruction''. Views this transformation as independent of the morphology.\n* '''Lexicalist theory''': sees ''destroy'' and ''destruction'' as having idiosyncratic lexical entries based on their differences in morphology. Argues that each morpheme contributes specific meaning. States that the formation of the complex word ''destruction'' is accounted for by a set of ''Lexical Rules,'' which are different and independent from syntactic rules.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/>\n\nA [[lexical entry]] lists the basic properties of either the whole word, or the individual properties of the morphemes that make up the word itself. The properties of [[lexical item]]s include their category selection ''c-selection'', selectional properties ''s-selection'', (also known as semantic selection),<ref name=\"WILEY Blackwell\"/> phonological properties, and features. The properties of lexical items are idiosyncratic, unpredictable, and contain specific information about the lexical items that they describe.<ref name=\"WILEY Blackwell\"/>\n\nThe following is an example of a lexical entry for the verb ''put'':\n{|\n|-\n| \n ''put:'' V DP<sub>''agent''</sub> DP<sub>''experiencer''</sub>/PP<sub>''locative''</sub>\n|}\n\nLexicalist theories state that a word's meaning is derived from its morphology or a speaker's lexicon, and not its syntax. The degree of morphology's influence on overall grammar remains controversial.<ref name=\"WILEY Blackwell\"/> Currently, the linguists that perceive one engine driving both morphological items and syntactic items are in the majority.\n\n=== Micro-syntactic theories: 1990s to the present ===\nBy the early 1990s, Chomsky's [[Minimalist program|minimalist framework]] on language structure led to sophisticated probing techniques for investigating languages.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Fodor|first1=Jerry|last2=Lepore|first2=Ernie|date=Aug 1999|journal=The Journal of Philosophy|volume=96|issue=8|pages=381\u2013403|jstor=2564628|doi=10.5840/jphil199996818|title=All at Sea in Semantic Space|url=https://semanticscholar.org/paper/b71ab3386f6eb9fbf5e855fa4cf4b80d9dc3b268}}</ref> These probing techniques analyzed negative data over [[prescriptive grammar]]s, and because of Chomsky's proposed Extended Projection Principle in 1986, probing techniques showed where specifiers of a sentence had moved to in order to fulfill the EPP. This allowed syntacticians to hypothesize that lexical items with complex syntactic features (such as [[Ditransitive verb|ditransitive]], [[inchoative verb|inchoative]], and [[causative verb|causative]] verbs), could select their own specifier element within a [[Concrete syntax tree|syntax tree]] construction. (For more on probing techniques, see Suci, G., Gammon, P., & Gamlin, P. (1979)).\n\nThis brought the focus back on the syntax-lexical semantics interface; however, syntacticians still sought to understand the relationship between complex verbs and their related syntactic structure, and to what degree the syntax was projected from the lexicon, as the Lexicalist theories argued.\n\nIn the mid 90's, linguists [[Heidi Harley]], [[Samuel Jay Keyser]], and [[Kenneth L. Hale|Kenneth Hale]] addressed some of the implications posed by complex verbs and a lexically-derived syntax. Their proposals indicated that the predicates CAUSE and BECOME, referred to as subunits within a Verb Phrase, acted as a lexical semantic template.<ref>Pinker, S. 1989. \"Learnability and Cognition: The Acquisition of Argument Structure.\" Cambridge. MIT Press. pp 89</ref> ''Predicates'' are verbs and state or affirm something about the subject of the sentence or the argument of the sentence. For example, the predicates ''went'' and ''is here'' below affirm the argument of the subject and the state of the subject respectively.\n\n{|\n|-\n| \n ''Lucy went home.\n ''The parcel is here.''\n|}\n\nThe subunits of Verb Phrases led to the Argument Structure Hypothesis and Verb Phrase Hypothesis, both outlined below.<ref>Harley, Heidi. \"Events, agents and the interpretation of VP-shells.\" (1996).</ref> The recursion found under the \"umbrella\" Verb Phrase, the VP Shell, accommodated binary-branching theory; another critical topic during the 1990s.<ref>Kayne, Richard S.

Thus, the structure of a predicate is strictly a lexical representation, where each phrasal head projects its argument onto a phrasal level within the syntax tree. The selection of this phrasal head is based on Chomsky's Empty Category Principle. This lexical projection of the predicate's argument onto the syntactic structure is the foundation for the Argument Structure Hypothesis.<ref name=\"Hale\" /> This idea coincides with Chomsky's [[Projection Principle]], because it forces a VP to be selected locally and be selected by a Tense Phrase (TP).\n\nBased on the interaction between lexical properties, locality, and the properties of the EPP (where a phrasal head selects another phrasal element locally), Hale and Keyser make the claim that the Specifier position or a complement are the only two semantic relations that project a predicate's argument. In 2003, Hale and Keyser put forward this hypothesis and argued that a lexical unit must have one or the other, Specifier or Complement, but cannot have both.<ref>Paul Bennett, 2003.

This branching ensures that the Specifier is the consistently subject, even when investigating the projection of a complex verb's lexical entry and its corresponding syntactic construction. This generalization is also present in Ramchand's theory that the complement of a head for a complex verb phrase must co-describe the verb's event.\n\nRamchand also introduced the concept of Homomorphic Unity, which refers to the structural synchronization between the head of a complex verb phrase and its complement. According to Ramchand, Homomorphic Unity is \"when two event descriptors are syntactically Merged, the structure of the complement must unify with the structure of the head.\"<ref name=Ramchand>{{cite book|last1=Ramchand|first1=Gillian|title=Verb Meaning and the Lexicon: A First Phase Syntax|date=2008|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=9780511486319}}</ref>\n\n== Classification of event types ==\n\n=== Intransitive verbs: unaccusative versus unergative ===\n{{multiple image\n| align = right\n| direction = horizontal\n| header =\n| width = 100\n\n| image1 = Unaccusativeexample.png\n|thumb\n| caption1 = Underlying tree structure for (2a)\n\n| image2 = Unergativeexample.png\n|thumb\n| caption2 = Underlying tree structure for (2b)\n\n}}\n\nThe unaccusative hypothesis was put forward by David Perlmutter in 1987, and describes how two classes of intransitive verbs have two different syntactic structures.

(For example, the VP ''the vase broke'' carries a change-of-state meaning of the vase becoming broken, and thus has a silent BECOME subunit within its underlying structure.) There are two types of change-of-state predicates: [[inchoative]] and [[causative]].\n\nInchoative verbs are [[Intransitive verb|intransitive]], meaning that they occur without a direct object, and these verbs express that their subject has undergone a certain change of state. Inchoative verbs are also known as [[anticausative]] verbs.<ref name=\"An Overview of Lexical Semantics\">{{cite journal|last1=Johnson|first1=Kent|title=An Overview of Lexical Semantics|journal=Philosophy Compass|date=2008|pages=119\u2013134|url=http://www.lps.uci.edu/~johnsonk/Publications/Johnson.AnOverviewOfLexicalSemantics.pdf}}</ref> Causative verbs are transitive, meaning that they occur with a direct object, and they express that the subject causes a change of state in the object.\n\nLinguist [[Martin Haspelmath]] classifies inchoative/causative verb pairs under three main categories: causative, anticausative, and non-directed alternations.<ref name=\"Haspelmath1\">{{cite book|last1=Haspelmath|first1=Martin|title=More on the typology of inchoative/causative verb alternations|journal=Causatives and Transitivity|date=1993|volume=23|pages=87\u2013121|url=https://www.academia.edu/3452966|doi=10.1075/slcs.23.05has|series=Studies in Language Companion Series|isbn=978-90-272-3026-3}}</ref> Non-directed alternations are further subdivided into labile, equipollent, and suppletive alternations.\n{{multiple image\n| align = right\n| direction = horizontal\n| header =\n| width = 160\n\n| image1 = Vasebreak.png\n|thumb\n| caption1 = Underlying tree structure for (3a)\n\n| image2 = Johnbrokevase.png\n|thumb\n| caption2 = Underlying tree structure for (3b)\n\n}}\n[[English language|English]] tends to favour [[Ambitransitive verb|labile alternations]],<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Pi\u00f1\u00f3n|first1=Christopher|title=A finer look at the causative-inchoative alternation|date=2001|pages=346\u2013364|url=http://elanguage.net/journals/salt/article/viewFile/11.346/1719}}</ref> meaning that the same verb is used in the inchoative and causative forms.<ref name=\"Haspelmath1\" /> This can be seen in the following example: ''broke'' is an intransitive inchoative verb in (3a) and a transitive causative verb in (3b).\n{|\n|-\n| \n (3) '''English''' <ref name=\"An Overview of Lexical Semantics\" />\n     a.

In the underlying tree structure for (3b), the silent subunits CAUS and BECOME are both embedded within the VP, resulting in the causative change-of-state meaning (x cause y become z).<ref name=\"WILEY Blackwell\" />\n\nEnglish change of state verbs are often de-adjectival, meaning that they are derived from adjectives. We can see this in the following example:\n{|\n|-\n| \n (4) a.

The causative verbs in these languages remain unmarked. [[Martin Haspelmath|Haspelmath]] refers to this as the [[anticausative]] alternation.\n{{multiple image\n| align = right\n| direction = horizontal\n| header =\n| width = 170\n\n| image1 = Zerbrach.png\n|thumb\n| caption1 = Underlying tree structure for (4a)\n\n| image2 = Hanszerbrach.png\n|thumb\n| caption2 = Underlying tree structure for (4b)\n\n}}\nFor example, inchoative verbs in [[German language|German]] are classified into three morphological classes. ''Class A'' verbs necessarily form inchoatives with the reflexive pronoun ''{{lang|de|sich}}'', ''Class B'' verbs form inchoatives necessarily without the reflexive pronoun, and ''Class C'' verbs form inchoatives optionally with or without the reflexive pronoun. In example (5), the verb ''{{lang|de|zerbrach}}'' is an unmarked inchoative verb from ''Class B'', which also remains unmarked in its causative form.<ref name=\"Schafer\" />\n{|\n|-\n| \n (5) '''German'''  <ref name=\"Schafer\" />\n     a.

While this debate is still unresolved in languages such as [[Italian language|Italian]], [[French language|French]], and [[Greek language|Greek]], it has been suggested by linguist Florian Sch\u00e4fer that there are semantic differences between marked and unmarked inchoatives in [[German language|German]]. Specifically, that only unmarked inchoative verbs allow an unintentional causer reading (meaning that they can take on an \"''x unintentionally caused y''\" reading).<ref name=\"Schafer\" />\n\n==== Marked causatives ====\n{{multiple image\n| align = right\n| direction = horizontal\n| header =\n| width = 190\n\n| image1 = angbata.png\n|thumb\n| caption1 = Underlying tree structure for (7a)\n\n| image2 = sirosa2.png\n|thumb\n| caption2 = Underlying tree structure for (7b)\n\n}}\nCausative morphemes are present in the verbs of many languages (e.g., [[Tagalog language|Tagalog]], [[Malagasy language|Malagasy]], [[Turkish language|Turkish]], etc.), usually appearing in the form of an affix on the verb.<ref name=\"An Overview of Lexical Semantics\" /> This can be seen in the following examples from [[Tagalog language|Tagalog]], where the causative prefix ''pag-'' (realized here as ''nag'') attaches to the verb ''tumba'' to derive a causative transitive verb in (7b), but the prefix does not appear in the inchoative intransitive verb in (7a).

The idea of unambiguous paths stated that an antecedent and an anaphor should be connected via an unambiguous path. This means that the line connecting an antecedent and an anaphor cannot be broken by another argument.<ref name=\"Kayne\">Kayne, R. (1981). Unambiguous paths. In R. May & F.

In this tree structure it can be seen that the same path can be traced from either DP to the verb. Tree diagram (7b) illustrates this structure with an example from English.

In ditransitive verbs such as ''give someone something'', ''send someone something'', ''show someone something'' etc. there is an underlying causative meaning that is represented in the underlying structure. As seen in example in (9a) above, ''John sent Mary a package'', there is the underlying meaning that 'John \"caused\" Mary to have a package'.\n\nLarson proposed that both sentences in (9a) and (9b) share the same underlying structure and the difference on the surface lies in that the double object construction \"John sent Mary a package\" is derived by transformation from a NP plus PP construction \"John sent a package to Mary\".\n\n==== Beck & Johnson's 2004 double object construction ====\n\nBeck and Johnson, however, give evidence that the two underlying structures are not the same.<ref name=beck>{{cite journal|last1=Sigrid|first1=Beck|last2=Johnson|first2=Kyle|title=Double Objects Again|journal=Linguistic Inquiry|date=2004|volume=35|issue=1|pages=97\u2013124|url=http://people.umass.edu/partee/docs/Beck_and_Johnson_2004.pdf|doi=10.1162/002438904322793356}}</ref> In so doing, they also give further evidence of the presence of two VPs where the verb attaches to a causative verb.

''Thilo cooked Satoshi kisimen.<ref name=\"beck\" />\n      b. ''Thilo cooked kisimen for Satoshi''.\n|}\nThe underlying structures are therefore not the same. The differences lie in the semantics and the syntax of the sentences, in contrast to the transformational theory of Larson. Further evidence for the structural existence of VP shells with an invisible verbal unit is given in the application of the adjunct or modifier \"again\". Sentence (16) is ambiguous and looking into the two different meanings reveals a difference in structure.\n{|\n|-\n| \n (16) ''Sally opened the door again''.<ref name=\"beck\" />\n|}\n{{multiple image\n| align = right\n| direction = horizontal\n| header =\n| width = 150\n\n| image1 = Larson3.png\n|thumb\n| caption1 = Underlying tree structure for (17a)\n\n| image2 = Larson1.png\n|thumb\n| caption2 = Underlying tree structure for (17b)\n\n}}\nHowever, in (17a), it is clear that it was Sally who repeated the action of opening the door. In (17b), the event is in the door being opened and Sally may or may not have opened it previously. To render these two different meanings, \"again\" attaches to VPs in two different places, and thus describes two events with a purely structural change.\n{|\n|-\n| \n (17) a. ''Sally was so kind that she went out of her way to open the door''\n         ''once again.''<ref name=\"beck\" />\n      b.

In Uralungal, Kozhikode district, where few people are living without jobs and wages, few villagers reached the temple complex at Puthalath in Mahi to hear the discourse of Vagbhatananda Guru. Impressed by the Guru's talk, who shared the Renaissance ideas, they invited Vagbhadananda to their homeland. In 1917, he formed a spiritual school under the leadership of a guru who arrived in Karakkad region of Uralungal. No one in the country was given a job. The young men approached the Guru with sarcasm. The Guru said that this should not hinder the progress of the proceedings and suggested a simple solution. Start a co-operative group by organizing young people who are willing to work. Thus, on 13 February 1925, the Unemployed Mutual Assistance Group of Mercantile Workers registered a co-operative group called Umballa. This is the story behind the birth of the Uralunkal Labor Contract Co-operative Society (ULCCS), which has transformed the face of Kerala by building major over bridges, highways and flyovers.\n\nThe name of the village of Uralungal, a village in North Malabar, which no one knows about, was signed by Vagbhatanandan, one of the lamps of the Kerala Renaissance. The work undertaken by the Uralungal Society, in the beginning, was the construction of a fence, a small wall, and a well. The Guru had already strictly stated that the aim was not to make a profit. The ULCC says that these workers are the beneficiaries of today's upliftment, ensuring quality, free of corruption and discipline. Says Chairman Palleri Ramesan. It was a time when the railways were stranded on 12 of Malabar's national highways. Until then, the ULCCSS had been confined to the Vadakara taluk and adjoining areas, taking only minor road contracts. The contract for the road to the Chorodu overbridge on the Vadakara-Thalassery highway was taken. At the time, the firm did not have the necessary equipment and equipment to perform the big contract work. The undertaking of a six crore construction project in 1999 was a turning point in the growth of the company. This public company, which did not even have its engineer, completed its work in due time and good standing. All began to know the name of Uralungal. The movement did not have to seek contract work again. A large number of government and private sector construction workers came to Uralungal.

The squadron was disestablished on 22 May 2012.\n\n== Squadron History ==\n\n=== 1950s ===\nFleet Air Reconnaissance in the European Theater had been conducted since the start of the Cold War by detachments within patrol squadrons (VP) flying modified PB4Y-2 Privateers from [[Naval Air Station Port Lyautey|NAS Port Lyautey]] and conducting missions in the Baltic, Black, Mediterranean, and North Seas. Shortly after the start of the Korean War in 1950, a dedicated unit, Naval Air Activities (NAA), Port Lyautey Patrol Unit (NPU) was established with three PB4Y-2 aircraft and personnel transferred from VP-26. As this unit demonstrated its value to the Navy, the Chief of Naval Operations (CNO) and the Bureau of Aeronautics (BuAer) came to realize that a dedicated aircraft was a necessity. \n\nBy 1952, the VP community had not had much success with the [[Martin P4M Mercator|P-4M-1 Mercator]]  that it had deployed to Morocco due to maintenance issues arising from its nineteen airframe total production run. The rest of the VP community found easier maintenance with the Lockheed P2V Neptunes deployed in theater because that airframe had been adopted as the VP standard asset. The maritime patrol commanders removed them from frontline service at Lyautey in favor of the Neptune.  Washington subsequently decided to reconfigure all but one P4M-1 as P4M-1Qs and permanently assign them to the Naval Communications Units established at NPU and its sister unit at Sangley Point, Philippines.\n\nIn 1953, with the conversion and deployment of the P4M-1Q, NPU needed  an administrative identity as part of the Naval Air Force Atlantic (AIRLANT) structure and Airborne Early Warning Squadron TWO (VW-2) at NAS Patuxent River became the command into which NPU was folded as VW-2 DET A. Since VW-2 Det A's mission began to diverge greatly from the parent unit's VW mission, the Navy decided to establish dedicated squadrons for the Fleet Air Reconnaissance mission. One was to be formed from VW-2 Det A and the other would be formed from its siter unit at Sangley, VW-1 Det A.\n\nVQ-2 was commissioned as [[Electronic countermeasure|Electronic Countermeasures]] Squadron TWO (ECMRON TWO) on September 1, 1955 to provide the United States with an improved defense posture. The squadron took over VW-2 DET A's spcaes and hangar at NAS Port Lyautey.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite web|title = VQ-2 Fleet Air  Reconnaissance Squadron TWO|url = http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/agency/navy/vq-2.htm|website = www.globalsecurity.org|accessdate = 2015-11-06}}</ref> Through the 1950s, VQ-2 would continue to fly missions throughout the European Theater operating from Cyprus, Germany, Libya, Turkey, and the United Kingdom.\n\n[[File:Martin P4M Mercator VQ-2 06.09.56.jpg|thumb|left|P4M-1Q Mercator of VQ-2 electronics reconnaissance squadron in September 1956 - note extra radar 'bulges' on this variant]]\n\nThe squadron continued using the P4M-1Qs as mission aircraft. To give the squadron a ship-based capability allowing its assets to travel with the battle group, in September 1956, a new and faster [[Carrier-based aircraft|carrier-capable]] [[Douglas A-3 Skywarrior|A-3D-1Q Skywarrior]] was delivered to the squadron.\n\nOn 6 January 1958, at the end of a ferry flight from Port Lyautey, via Lajes, Azores and Bermuda to [[NAS Norfolk]], Virginia, P4M-1Q (BUNO 124373)<ref name=VPNavy>[https://www.vpnavy.com/vq2_mishap.html VP Association List of Maritime Aircraft Mishaps]</ref> lost an engine on approach. The aircraft crashed at at 22 St. and E. Ocean Ave., Norfolk, killing four crew and injuring three civilians.<ref name=Anderson>Unknown, \"Four Missing In Air Crash\", ''The Anderson Independent'', 7 January 1958</ref> Two aircrew were injured and one was uninjured.\n\nOn 16 October 1958, returning from Incirlik, A3D-1Q (BUNO 130356)<ref name=A3BUNO>[https://www.a3skywarrior.com/ready-room/a-3-dispositions/a-3-production.html Skywarrior Association Aircraft History by Bureau Number]</ref> crashed near the airfield. All four aircrew aboard were killed.\n\nAs a result of the Pact of Madrid, signed on 23 September 1953 by [[Francoist Spain|Spain]] and the [[United States]], the US pledged  to furnish [[foreign aid|economic]] and [[military aid]] to Spain. The United States, in turn, was to be permitted to construct and to utilize air and naval bases on Spanish territory ([[Naval Station Rota]], [[Mor\u00f3n Air Base]], [[Torrej\u00f3n Air Base]], and [[Zaragoza Air Base]]). By 1959, the base at Rota and its airfield had been completed to satisfy the US Navy's aviation needs. Due to its newer facilities, the Navy decided to move VQ-2 to Rota.\n\n=== 1960s ===\nWhile keeping the alphanumeric designation VQ-2, EMCRON TWO was renamed Fleet Air Reconnaissance Squadron TWO (FAIRECONRON TWO) on January 1, 1960. Its sister squadron, [[VQ-1]] was similarly renamed. That month, the squadron was transferred to NS Rota, Spain.\n\nShortly after the change of homeport, on 19 January 1960, the squadron lost one of its P4M-1Qs and all sixteen aircrew when it crashed into a mountainside at 9,000 feet om approach to crashed on approach to [[Incirlik Air Base|Incirlik AFB]]. The crew had been flying in to relieve the detachment that had been operating there. Shortly thereafter, the P4M-1Q aircraft started being replaced by the [EC-121 Warning Star|Lockheed WV-2Q Warning Star]]. \n[[File:Lockheed EC-121M VQ-2.jpg|left|thumb|A U.S. Navy Lockheed EC-121M Warning Star of VQ-2.]]\n\nIn response to the [[Berlin Crisis of 1961]], VQ-2 flew missions in West Germany along the border with Czechoslovakia and East Germany as well as their routine missions into the Baltic. By now these were being carried out primarily by the WV-2Qs and A3D-2Qs. Tensions continued to increase as the Kennedy administration and its NATO allies responded to Soviet moves in Europe.\n\nOn 22 May, 1962, a WV-2Q (BUNO 131390)<ref>http://www.dean-boys.com/ec-121.htm</ref> staged at [[Lucius D. Clay Kaserne|Wiesbaden Air Base]], took off from [[F\u00fcrstenfeldbruck Air Base]] on a training flight. Inflight, the rear cargo door opened causing the tail to separate from the remainder of the fuselage at the main cargo door. The main fuselage and tail section crashed southwest of [[Markt Schwaben]].<ref>https://stationhypo.com/2018/09/05/history-of-vq-2-part-3-of-5/</ref><ref>http://vqassociation.org/history/</ref>. All fifteen Navy and four Army aircrew were killed.\n\nIn October 1962, the WV-2Q was redesignated the EC-121M Super Constellation.<ref name=\":0\" /> and in the same month the [[Cuban Missile Crisis]] developed. Since the Navy had no comparable reconnaissance assets available in the Continental United States (CONUS), VQ-2 deployed an EA3B and an EC-121M to [[NAS Key West]] to provide those services around Cuba.\n\nThe [[United Nations Security Council Resolution 186|Cyprus Crisis in 1964]] saw an increase in international tensions in the Eastern Mediterranean. This led to an increase in EC-121M and EA-3B presence in the Levant. EA-3Bs in the Mediterranean still operated from land despite the increasing demand to man detachments onboard Sixth Fleet aircraft carriers.\n\nDuring the Vietnam War, the squadron deployed detachments to augment  VQ-1's support of US Navy operations in and around Vietnam under CINCPACFLT operational control. In late summer 1965, VQ-2 established DET ALFA at [[NAS Cubi Point]], Philippines. Sorties were routinely flown into the theater to support Seventh Fleet. After it sister squadron, [[VQ-1]], established its DET BRAVO flying from [[Da Nang]] Air Base in South Vietnam, VQ-2 EA-3Bs infrequently joined them operating as VQ-2 DET BRAVO. From both locations VQ-2 Whales provided continuous electronic reconnaissance capability over the area, including the [[Ho Chi Minh Trail]] and [[Gulf of Tonkin]]. As combat operations from CTF 77 on [[Yankee Station]] into North Vietnamese airspace increased, VQ-2 joined VQ-1 in deploying EA-3Bs to the attack carriers in theater. VQ-2 ceased operations from Da Nang in 1969, but continued to deploy to the aircraft carriers and Cubi Point.\n\nThe squadron suffered three fatal Whale losses between 1966 and 1968:\n# On 3 November 1966, an EA-3B (BUNO 146458)<ref>https://www.a3skywarrior.com/ready-room/a-3-dispositions/a-3-production.html</ref> disappeared inbound to a recovery on the USS Independence in the central Mediterranean off [[Sicily]]. All six aircrew were lost at sea.\n# On 28 May 1966, an EA-3B Skywarrior (BUNO 142257) of DET ALFA, ran into a typhoon enroute Vietnam. Four of the aircrew bailed out as the three in the cockpit managed to recover the aircraft. The aircraft with the pilot, navigator and crew chief made it back to DET ALFA. The other four perished with only one body recovered and the personal effects of the other three.<ref>https://www.a3skywarrior.com/ready-room/a-3-dispositions/a-3-production.html</ref><ref>https://stationhypo.com/2018/09/05/history-of-vq-2-part-3-of-5/</ref>\n# On 4 June 1968, an EA-3B (BUNO 142670)<ref>https://www.a3skywarrior.com/ready-room/a-3-dispositions/a-3-production.html</ref>, flown by the new (by barely beyond a month)squadron CO, CDR T.E. Daum, crashed on takeoff from Rota on a flight to a conference in [[Naples, Italy]]. The Whale lost an engine just after takeoff descended slowly until hitting the ground on the down slope of a hill cartwheeling into a sugar beet field approximately one mile east of the Rota runway. CDR Daum and three of his department heads who were aboard were killed. The crew chief and another petty officer survived. Twp squadron junior officers on their way in to the command were the first people to the crash site.<ref>https://aviation-safety.net/wikibase/158670</ref>\n\nThe loss of the USS Liberty during the Six Day War in 1967, reaffirmed the relative safety of using aircraft for fleet reconnaissance. This incident kept the high tempo of operations in the Eastern Mediterranean despite a cesation of strife in Cyprus. As the decade came to a close, VQ-2 found itself operating all over Europe as well as in Southeast Asia.\n\n=== 1970s ===\n[[File:EP-3E Orion of VQ-2 parked c1971.jpg|thumb|EP-3E Aries of VQ-2 parked in 1971]]\nOn 26 February 1970, an EA-3B (BUNO 144851)<ref>https://www.a3skywarrior.com/ready-room/a-3-dispositions/a-3-production.html</ref> was lost while operating from [[USS Franklin D. Roosevelt (CV-42)|USS ''Franklin D. Roosevelt'']] in the Mediterranean. The [[Aircraft catapult|catapult]] system malfunctioned in mid-stroke, also known as a 'cold cat,\" resulting in the Whale \u201cdribbling\u201d off the bow and being run over by the carrier. Four of the crew members died in the accident<ref name=\":2\">{{Cite web|title = Cold War Museum|url = http://www.coldwar.org/histories/HistoryofUSNavyFleetAirReconnaissancePartTwo.asp|website = www.coldwar.org|accessdate = 2015-11-08}}</ref>\n\nVQ-2 continued to operate and maintain EC-121M aircraft into 1974. The A3D-1Q was replaced by the A3D-2Q and was subsequently re-designated the EA-3B Skywarrior.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nOn 31 July 1971, the squadron received its first delivery of the [[Lockheed EP-3|EP-3E Aries]] aircraft.<ref name=\":0\" /> This relatively newer airframe gave the squadron a more reliable platform due to its commonality with the VP P-3s and the availability of parts.\n\nIncreasing terrorism related to strife in the Middle East and the increasing Libyan radicalization after the 1969 coup led to a continued high operational tempo. Tensions came to a head with the 1973 Yom Kippur War. This tempo lasted through the decade despite the overall drawdown of the US military after Vietnam.\n\nOn 9 July 1974, the squadron suffered another A-3 loss when its VIP transport-configured A-3, a TA-3B (BUNO 144863)<ref>https://www.a3skywarrior.com/ready-room/a-3-dispositions/a-3-production.html</ref> crashed at [[Naples International Airport|Capodichino]] in Naples, Italy on approach. All eight aircrew perished in the crash.\n\nThroughout the remainder of the 1970s, the command suffered no aircraft losses. In 1979, the [[Iranian Revolution]] saw an increased US Presence in the Persian Gulf and Indian Ocean. In response, the Navy maintained at least one carrier battle group in the vicinity of the Gulf. VQ-2 shared the manning of carrier and Diego Garcia detachments.<ref>http://www.coldwar.org/histories/HistoryofUSNavyFleetAirReconnaissancePartTwo.asp</ref> This manning would continue until the third phase of the [[Lebanese Civil War]] in 1982.\n\n=== 1980s ===\n[[File:EA-3B VQ-2 after landing on USS Saratoga (CV-60) c1986.jpg|left|thumb|EA-3B VQ-2 after landing on [[USS Saratoga (CV-60)|USS]] Saratoga inn 1986.]]\nAs VQ-2 entered the mid-1980s, the frenzied pace of operations including [[Operation Mole Cricket 19]](Arab-Israel [[Beqaa Valley|Beqaa]] War), and continuing with 1982 - 1983 [[Multinational Force in Lebanon|Beirut Crisis]] with the [[1983 Beirut barracks bombing|U.S. Marine barracks bombing]], and the [[United States Sixth Fleet|Sixth Fleet]] December [[Multinational Force in Lebanon|1983 air strike into Lebanon]], allowed little leisure time for the squadron.<ref name=\":2\" />\n\nVQ-2 was awarded the [[Navy Expeditionary Medal]] for participation in the Beirut evacuation and operations in the vicinity of [[Libya]] during [[1986 United States bombing of Libya|Operation El Dorado Canyon]], 12\u201317 April 1986.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nOn 25 January 1987, an EA-3B crashed on the USS Nimitz killing all seven crew members.\n\n=== 1990s ===\nIn the summer of 1990, the squadron provided electronic reconnaissance during the evacuation of 2000 non-combatant personnel from war-stricken [[Liberia]] in [[operation Sharp Edge]].<ref name=\":0\" />\n[[File:Lockheed EP-3E Orion (ARIES), USA - Navy AN2094464.jpg|thumb|EP-3E of VQ-2 based at Rota, Spain, seen arriving for [[Royal International Air Tattoo|RIAT]] '92.]]\nFrom August 1990 to April 1991, VQ-2 provided combat reconnaissance during operations [[Gulf War|Desert Shield/Desert Storm]], Proven Force, and [[Operation Provide Comfort|Provide Comfort]].<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nOn 29 June 1991, the first EP-3E Aries II aircraft arrived in Rota and on 20 September 1991, the squadron retired the EA-3B Skywarrior the same year.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nStarting in July 1992, VQ-2 flew support missions with Operations [[Operation Deny Flight|Deny Flight]], Provide Promise, Sharp Guard, Joint Endeavor, Decisive Endeavor, and Deliberate Guard providing combat reconnaissance and intelligence to [[NATO]] and [[United Nations]] forces in the Former [[Yugoslavia]].<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nAs of 1997, VQ-2 operated four EP-3E Aries II aircraft and two [[Lockheed P-3 Orion|P-3C Orion]] aircraft from its home-base at Rota and two-plane detachment at [[Souda Bay|Naval Support Activity Souda Bay, Crete]].<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nIn March 1997, VQ-2 provided electronic reconnaissance during the evacuation of non-combatant personnel from [[Albania]] following unrest from a failed [[Pyramid scheme|pyramid savings scheme]] during [[Operation Silver Wake]].<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n=== 2000s ===\nVQ-2 relocated from NS Rota, Spain, to NAS Whidbey Island, effective 1 September 2005.

Shortly after the start of the Korean War in 1950, a dedicated unit, Naval Air Activities (NAA), Port Lyautey Patrol Unit (NPU) was established with three PB4Y-2 aircraft and personnel transferred from VP-26. As this unit demonstrated its value to the Navy, the Chief of Naval Operations (CNO) and the Bureau of Aeronautics (BuAer) came to realize that a dedicated aircraft was a necessity. \n\nBy 1952, the VP community had not had much success with the [[Martin P4M Mercator|P-4M-1 Mercator]]  that it had deployed to Morocco due to maintenance issues arising from its nineteen airframe total production run. The rest of the VP community found easier maintenance with the Lockheed P2V Neptunes deployed in theater because that airframe had been adopted as the VP standard asset. The maritime patrol commanders removed them from frontline service at Lyautey in favor of the Neptune.  Washington subsequently decided to reconfigure all but one P4M-1 as P4M-1Qs and permanently assign them to the Naval Communications Units established at NPU and its sister unit at Sangley Point, Philippines.\n\nIn 1953, with the conversion and deployment of the P4M-1Q, NPU needed  an administrative identity as part of the Naval Air Force Atlantic (AIRLANT) structure and Airborne Early Warning Squadron TWO (VW-2) at NAS Patuxent River became the command into which NPU was folded as VW-2 DET A. Since VW-2 Det A's mission began to diverge greatly from the parent unit's VW mission, the Navy decided to establish dedicated squadrons for the Fleet Air Reconnaissance mission. One was to be formed from VW-2 Det A and the other would be formed from its siter unit at Sangley, VW-1 Det A.\n\nVQ-2 was commissioned as [[Electronic countermeasure|Electronic Countermeasures]] Squadron TWO (ECMRON TWO) on September 1, 1955 to provide the United States with an improved defense posture. The squadron took over VW-2 DET A's spcaes and hangar at NAS Port Lyautey.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite web|title = VQ-2 Fleet Air  Reconnaissance Squadron TWO|url = http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/agency/navy/vq-2.htm|website = www.globalsecurity.org|accessdate = 2015-11-06}}</ref> Through the 1950s, VQ-2 would continue to fly missions throughout the European Theater operating from Cyprus, Germany, Libya, Turkey, and the United Kingdom.\n\n[[File:Martin P4M Mercator VQ-2 06.09.56.jpg|thumb|left|P4M-1Q Mercator of VQ-2 electronics reconnaissance squadron in September 1956 - note extra radar 'bulges' on this variant]]\n\nThe squadron continued using the P4M-1Qs as mission aircraft. To give the squadron a ship-based capability allowing its assets to travel with the battle group, in September 1956, a new and faster [[Carrier-based aircraft|carrier-capable]] [[Douglas A-3 Skywarrior|A-3D-1Q Skywarrior]] was delivered to the squadron.\n\nOn 6 January 1958, at the end of a ferry flight from Port Lyautey, via Lajes, Azores and Bermuda to [[NAS Norfolk]], Virginia, P4M-1Q (BUNO 124373)<ref>https://www.vpnavy.com/vq2_mishap.html</ref> lost an engine on approach. The aircraft crashed at at 22 St. and E. Ocean Ave., Norfolk, killing four crew and injuring three civilians.<ref>Associated Press, \"Four Missing In Air Crash\", ''The Anderson Independent'', Anderson, South Carolina, Tuesday 7 January 1958, Volume 41, Number 99, page 1.</ref> Two aircrew were injured and one was uninjured.\n\nOn 16 October 1958, returning from Incirlik, A3D-1Q (BUNO 130356)<ref>https://www.a3skywarrior.com/ready-room/a-3-dispositions/a-3-production.html</ref> crashed near the airfield. All four aircrew aboard were killed.\n\nAs a result of the Pact of Madrid, signed on 23 September 1953 by [[Francoist Spain|Spain]] and the [[United States]], the US pledged  to furnish [[foreign aid|economic]] and [[military aid]] to Spain. The United States, in turn, was to be permitted to construct and to utilize air and naval bases on Spanish territory ([[Naval Station Rota]], [[Mor\u00f3n Air Base]], [[Torrej\u00f3n Air Base]], and [[Zaragoza Air Base]]). By 1959, the base at Rota and its airfield had been completed to satisfy the US Navy's aviation needs. Due to its newer facilities, the Navy decided to move VQ-2 to Rota.\n\n=== 1960s ===\nWhile keeping the alphanumeric designation VQ-2, EMCRON TWO was renamed Fleet Air Reconnaissance Squadron TWO (FAIRECONRON TWO) on January 1, 1960. Its sister squadron, [[VQ-1]] was similarly renamed. That month, the squadron was transferred to NS Rota, Spain.\n\nShortly after the change of homeport, on 19 January 1960, the squadron lost one of its P4M-1Qs and all sixteen aircrew when it crashed into a mountainside at 9,000 feet om approach to crashed on approach to [[Incirlik Air Base|Incirlik AFB]]. The crew had been flying in to relieve the detachment that had been operating there. Shortly thereafter, the P4M-1Q aircraft started being replaced by the [EC-121 Warning Star|Lockheed WV-2Q Warning Star]]. \n[[File:Lockheed EC-121M VQ-2.jpg|left|thumb|A U.S. Navy Lockheed EC-121M Warning Star of VQ-2.]]\n\nIn response to the [[Berlin Crisis of 1961]], VQ-2 flew missions in West Germany along the border with Czechoslovakia and East Germany as well as their routine missions into the Baltic. By now these were being carried out primarily by the WV-2Qs and A3D-2Qs. Tensions continued to increase as the Kennedy administration and its NATO allies responded to Soviet moves in Europe.\n\nOn 22 May, 1962, a WV-2Q (BUNO 131390)<ref>http://www.dean-boys.com/ec-121.htm</ref> staged at [[Lucius D. Clay Kaserne|Wiesbaden Air Base]], took off from [[F\u00fcrstenfeldbruck Air Base]] on a training flight. Inflight, the rear cargo door opened causing the tail to separate from the remainder of the fuselage at the main cargo door. The main fuselage and tail section crashed southwest of [[Markt Schwaben]].<ref>https://stationhypo.com/2018/09/05/history-of-vq-2-part-3-of-5/</ref><ref>http://vqassociation.org/history/</ref>. All fifteen Navy and four Army aircrew were killed.\n\nIn October 1962, the WV-2Q was redesignated the EC-121M Super Constellation.<ref name=\":0\" /> and in the same month the [[Cuban Missile Crisis]] developed. Since the Navy had no comparable reconnaissance assets available in the Continental United States (CONUS), VQ-2 deployed an EA3B and an EC-121M to [[NAS Key West]] to provide those services around Cuba.\n\nThe [[United Nations Security Council Resolution 186|Cyprus Crisis in 1964]] saw an increase in international tensions in the Eastern Mediterranean. This led to an increase in EC-121M and EA-3B presence in the Levant. EA-3Bs in the Mediterranean still operated from land despite the increasing demand to man detachments onboard Sixth Fleet aircraft carriers.\n\nDuring the Vietnam War, the squadron deployed detachments to augment  VQ-1's support of US Navy operations in and around Vietnam under CINCPACFLT operational control. In late summer 1965, VQ-2 established DET ALFA at [[NAS Cubi Point]], Philippines. Sorties were routinely flown into the theater to support Seventh Fleet. After it sister squadron, [[VQ-1]], established its DET BRAVO flying from [[Da Nang]] Air Base in South Vietnam, VQ-2 EA-3Bs infrequently joined them operating as VQ-2 DET BRAVO. From both locations VQ-2 Whales provided continuous electronic reconnaissance capability over the area, including the [[Ho Chi Minh Trail]] and [[Gulf of Tonkin]]. As combat operations from CTF 77 on [[Yankee Station]] into North Vietnamese airspace increased, VQ-2 joined VQ-1 in deploying EA-3Bs to the attack carriers in theater. VQ-2 ceased operations from Da Nang in 1969, but continued to deploy to the aircraft carriers and Cubi Point.\n\nThe squadron suffered three fatal Whale losses between 1966 and 1968:\n# On 3 November 1966, an EA-3B (BUNO 146458)<ref>https://www.a3skywarrior.com/ready-room/a-3-dispositions/a-3-production.html</ref> disappeared inbound to a recovery on the USS Independence in the central Mediterranean off [[Sicily]]. All six aircrew were lost at sea.\n# On 28 May 1966, an EA-3B Skywarrior (BUNO 142257) of DET ALFA, ran into a typhoon enroute Vietnam. Four of the aircrew bailed out as the three in the cockpit managed to recover the aircraft. The aircraft with the pilot, navigator and crew chief made it back to DET ALFA. The other four perished with only one body recovered and the personal effects of the other three.<ref>https://www.a3skywarrior.com/ready-room/a-3-dispositions/a-3-production.html</ref><ref>https://stationhypo.com/2018/09/05/history-of-vq-2-part-3-of-5/</ref>\n# On 4 June 1968, an EA-3B (BUNO 142670)<ref>https://www.a3skywarrior.com/ready-room/a-3-dispositions/a-3-production.html</ref>, flown by the new (by barely beyond a month)squadron CO, CDR T.E. Daum, crashed on takeoff from Rota on a flight to a conference in [[Naples, Italy]]. The Whale lost an engine just after takeoff descended slowly until hitting the ground on the down slope of a hill cartwheeling into a sugar beet field approximately one mile east of the Rota runway. CDR Daum and three of his department heads who were aboard were killed. The crew chief and another petty officer survived. Twp squadron junior officers on their way in to the command were the first people to the crash site.<ref>https://aviation-safety.net/wikibase/158670</ref>\n\nThe loss of the USS Liberty during the Six Day War in 1967, reaffirmed the relative safety of using aircraft for fleet reconnaissance. This incident kept the high tempo of operations in the Eastern Mediterranean despite a cesation of strife in Cyprus. As the decade came to a close, VQ-2 found itself operating all over Europe as well as in Southeast Asia.\n\n=== 1970s ===\n[[File:EP-3E Orion of VQ-2 parked c1971.jpg|thumb|EP-3E Aries of VQ-2 parked in 1971]]\nOn 26 February 1970, an EA-3B (BUNO 144851)<ref>https://www.a3skywarrior.com/ready-room/a-3-dispositions/a-3-production.html</ref> was lost while operating from [[USS Franklin D. Roosevelt (CV-42)|USS ''Franklin D. Roosevelt'']] in the Mediterranean. The [[Aircraft catapult|catapult]] system malfunctioned in mid-stroke, also known as a 'cold cat,\" resulting in the Whale \u201cdribbling\u201d off the bow and being run over by the carrier. Four of the crew members died in the accident<ref name=\":2\">{{Cite web|title = Cold War Museum|url = http://www.coldwar.org/histories/HistoryofUSNavyFleetAirReconnaissancePartTwo.asp|website = www.coldwar.org|accessdate = 2015-11-08}}</ref>\n\nVQ-2 continued to operate and maintain EC-121M aircraft into 1974. The A3D-1Q was replaced by the A3D-2Q and was subsequently re-designated the EA-3B Skywarrior.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nOn 31 July 1971, the squadron received its first delivery of the [[Lockheed EP-3|EP-3E Aries]] aircraft.<ref name=\":0\" /> This relatively newer airframe gave the squadron a more reliable platform due to its commonality with the VP P-3s and the availability of parts.\n\nIncreasing terrorism related to strife in the Middle East and the increasing Libyan radicalization after the 1969 coup led to a continued high operational tempo. Tensions came to a head with the 1973 Yom Kippur War. This tempo lasted through the decade despite the overall drawdown of the US military after Vietnam.\n\nOn 9 July 1974, the squadron suffered another A-3 loss when its VIP transport-configured A-3, a TA-3B (BUNO 144863)<ref>https://www.a3skywarrior.com/ready-room/a-3-dispositions/a-3-production.html</ref> crashed at [[Naples International Airport|Capodichino]] in Naples, Italy on approach. All eight aircrew perished in the crash.\n\nThroughout the remainder of the 1970s, the command suffered no aircraft losses. In 1979, the [[Iranian Revolution]] saw an increased US Presence in the Persian Gulf and Indian Ocean. In response, the Navy maintained at least one carrier battle group in the vicinity of the Gulf. VQ-2 shared the manning of carrier and Diego Garcia detachments.<ref>http://www.coldwar.org/histories/HistoryofUSNavyFleetAirReconnaissancePartTwo.asp</ref> This manning would continue until the third phase of the [[Lebanese Civil War]] in 1982.\n\n=== 1980s ===\n[[File:EA-3B VQ-2 after landing on USS Saratoga (CV-60) c1986.jpg|left|thumb|EA-3B VQ-2 after landing on [[USS Saratoga (CV-60)|USS]] Saratoga inn 1986.]]\nAs VQ-2 entered the mid-1980s, the frenzied pace of operations including [[Operation Mole Cricket 19]](Arab-Israel [[Beqaa Valley|Beqaa]] War), and continuing with 1982 - 1983 [[Multinational Force in Lebanon|Beirut Crisis]] with the [[1983 Beirut barracks bombing|U.S. Marine barracks bombing]], and the [[United States Sixth Fleet|Sixth Fleet]] December [[Multinational Force in Lebanon|1983 air strike into Lebanon]], allowed little leisure time for the squadron.<ref name=\":2\" />\n\nVQ-2 was awarded the [[Navy Expeditionary Medal]] for participation in the Beirut evacuation and operations in the vicinity of [[Libya]] during [[1986 United States bombing of Libya|Operation El Dorado Canyon]], 12\u201317 April 1986.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nOn 25 January 1987, an EA-3B crashed on the USS Nimitz killing all seven crew members.\n\n=== 1990s ===\nIn the summer of 1990, the squadron provided electronic reconnaissance during the evacuation of 2000 non-combatant personnel from war-stricken [[Liberia]] in [[operation Sharp Edge]].<ref name=\":0\" />\n[[File:Lockheed EP-3E Orion (ARIES), USA - Navy AN2094464.jpg|thumb|EP-3E of VQ-2 based at Rota, Spain, seen arriving for [[Royal International Air Tattoo|RIAT]] '92.]]\nFrom August 1990 to April 1991, VQ-2 provided combat reconnaissance during operations [[Gulf War|Desert Shield/Desert Storm]], Proven Force, and [[Operation Provide Comfort|Provide Comfort]].<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nOn 29 June 1991, the first EP-3E Aries II aircraft arrived in Rota and on 20 September 1991, the squadron retired the EA-3B Skywarrior the same year.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nStarting in July 1992, VQ-2 flew support missions with Operations [[Operation Deny Flight|Deny Flight]], Provide Promise, Sharp Guard, Joint Endeavor, Decisive Endeavor, and Deliberate Guard providing combat reconnaissance and intelligence to [[NATO]] and [[United Nations]] forces in the Former [[Yugoslavia]].<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nAs of 1997, VQ-2 operated four EP-3E Aries II aircraft and two [[Lockheed P-3 Orion|P-3C Orion]] aircraft from its home-base at Rota and two-plane detachment at [[Souda Bay|Naval Support Activity Souda Bay, Crete]].<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nIn March 1997, VQ-2 provided electronic reconnaissance during the evacuation of non-combatant personnel from [[Albania]] following unrest from a failed [[Pyramid scheme|pyramid savings scheme]] during [[Operation Silver Wake]].<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n=== 2000s ===\nVQ-2 relocated from NS Rota, Spain, to NAS Whidbey Island, effective 1 September 2005.

Carlson was working on ''Megaton'' #4, and was looking for replacements for artists who had moved on to bigger projects. Liefeld's submission packet consisted mostly of pinups of [[DC Comics]] characters like the [[Teen Titans]] and [[Legion of Super Heroes]], as well as some sketches of Megaton characters. Some of these earlier pinups are visible on Liefeld's website.<ref name=BigBangComics>[[Carlson, Gary]] (September 4, 2013).

Although Carlson liked Liefeld's work overall, he felt the young artist was not ready for professional work. Weeks later he received another set of samples that were an improvement, and later still, a four-page [[Berzerker (comics)|Berzerker]] story (not to be confused with the [[Berzerker (comics)|Marvel]] or [[Berserker (comics)|Top Cow]] characters of the same name), along with pinups of the Megaton characters Ultragirl and Ultraman.

Impressed with the artist's enthusiasm and the new art samples he showed them, Carlson gave Liefeld a test script in order to judge his ability to draw a page-to-page comics story.

At the convention, he showed editors his samples and offered a package, which consisted of 10 pages of sequential art featuring his own characters. Editor [[Dick Giordano]], to whom Liefeld showed his samples at the DC booth, requested that Liefeld send him more samples. Although Liefeld was apprehensive about approaching the Marvel booth, he did so at his friend's urging, and as a result, editor [[Mark Gruenwald]] offered Liefeld a job illustrating an eight-page ''[[The Avengers (comic book)|Avengers]]'' backup story featuring the [[Black Panther (comics)|Black Panther]], much to the 19-year-old artist's surprise. Though the published story was ultimately illustrated by another artist, Liefeld was later given character design work by the publisher. His first published story, was a [[DC Comics Bonus Book]] insert in ''[[Warlord (DC Comics)|Warlord]]'' #131 (September 1988). Editor [[Robert Greenberger]] recalled that Liefeld \"was discovered by my office-mate, Jonathan Peterson, who was scrambling to find something for him to do. I had the ''Warlord'' Bonus Book slot coming up, so to keep Rob from finding work at our rival, I tapped him for that.\"<ref>{{cite journal |last=Greenberger|first=Robert|authorlink=Robert Greenberger|title=New Talent and Bonus Babies|journal=[[Back Issue!]]|issue=71|page=72 |publisher=TwoMorrows Publishing|date=April 2014|location=Raleigh, North Carolina}}</ref> Next came the five-issue miniseries ''[[Hawk and Dove]]'' for DC Comics, the first issue of which was published with an October 1988 cover date.<ref name=CBGreats/><ref name=DCVisualChronicle/> It was this work that first garnered Liefeld visibility among readers of mainstream comics.<ref name=CBR.com7.30.01>Thomas, Michael (July 30, 2001).

Because this was done without editorial input, editor [[Mike Carlin]] cut and pasted the panels into the proper order, and [[Karl Kesel]] [[lightbox]]ed them onto DC comics paper to ink them. The letters column of ''Hawk and Dove'' #5 mentions that Liefeld \"showed something new to an editor who thought he'd seen everything.\" Liefeld explained this was how the dimension had been portrayed the only other time it had been featured in the book, although Kesel said this was untrue.<ref name=CBGUrbanLegends>{{cite web|url= http://goodcomics.comicbookresources.com/2006/02/02/comic-book-urban-legends-revealed-36/|title= Comic Book Urban Legends Revealed #36!|author=Cronin, Brian|date=February 2, 2006|publisher=CBR.com.}}</ref>\n\nShortly thereafter, Liefeld began doing work for Marvel Comics as well, his first assignment for them being ''[[The Amazing Spider-Man Annual]]'' #23.<ref name=CBGreats/> In 1989, Liefeld became the penciller for the Marvel series ''[[The New Mutants]]'', starting with issue #86.

''[[The Comics Journal]]''. pp. 3 \u2013 6.</ref> which underlined the increased popularity and clout that his stint on the title had earned him.<ref name=CBR.com7.30.01/>\n\nWith ''The New Mutants'' #98, Liefeld assumed full creative control over the series, penciling, inking, and plotting, with [[Fabian Nicieza]] writing dialog. The ''New Mutants'' series ended with issue 100, and was replaced with a revamped version of the team called ''[[X-Force]]'', whose 1991 debut issue sold four million copies, setting an industry-wide record later broken by [[Chris Claremont]] and [[Jim Lee]]'s ''X-Men'' (vol. 2) #1. The sales numbers were propelled by 1990s direct market sales strategies: [[Variant cover|five variant edition]] trading cards were [[polybag]]ged with ''X-Force'' #1 to encourage sales of multiple copies to single collectors, while ''X-Men'' #1 was sold with five variant covers. As of 2013, ''X-Force'' #1 remains the second highest-selling comic book in history.<ref name=CBR7.3.13/>\n\nIn mid-1990, [[Levi Strauss & Co.|Levi's]] began producing a series of TV commercials directed by [[Spike Lee]] for their 501 button fly jeans,<ref>Elliott, Stuart (July 22, 1991).

The exact title is unknown, but according to journalist Michael Dean, it was something to the effect of ''The X-Cutioners'', a title whose similarity to Marvel's X-Men family of titles evoked the ire of Marvel editor [[Bob Harras]], who threatened to fire Liefeld if he used that title.<ref>Dean, Michael.

In an interview in ''Hero Illustrated'' #4 (October 1993), Liefeld conceded disappointment with the first four issues of ''Youngblood'', calling the first issue a \"disaster\". Liefeld explained that production problems, as well as sub-par scripting by his friend and collaborator [[Hank Kanalz]], whose employment Liefeld later terminated, resulted in work that was lower in quality than that which Liefeld produced when [[Fabian Nicieza]] scripted his plots on ''X-Force'', and that reprints of those four issues would be re-scripted. Writer and ''[[Comics Buyer's Guide]]'' columnist [[Peter David]] pointed to Liefeld's scapegoating of Kanalz as an example of Liefeld's failure to take responsibility for his project, and evidence that genuine collaboration with good writers like Louise Simonson and Fabian Nicieza, which some of the Image founders did not appreciate, had previously reflected better on Liefeld's art.<ref name=CBR7.3.13/><ref name=CBR.com1.7.17/><ref name=GiveCredit1/>\n\nOther titles produced by Liefeld's Extreme Studios during the 1990s included ''[[Bloodstrike (Image Comics)|Bloodstrike]]'', ''[[Glory (comics)|Glory]]'', ''[[Prophet (comics)|Prophet]]'' and ''[[Avengelyne]]''.<ref>Dietsch, T.J.

The still-living Simon and Kirby's widow agreed to a figure Liefeld felt was too high, and he created a new similar character, Agent America. Simon threatened to sue, and the parties renegotiated a deal acceptable to all.

In a 2016 ''[[New York Times]]'' interview, Liefeld said that he did \"all the heavy lifting\" in writing and drawing the issue in which that character first appeared, while Nicieza wrote its script, saying, \"If a janitor scripted New Mutants 98, he'd be the co-creator \u2014 that's how it works, buddy.

Peter David responded to this rationale by stating that DePalma himself was criticized harshly by film critics for employing Hitchcock's techniques, and that Liefeld, who has identified himself as a \"stickler\" for credit, did not credit artists whose work he copied, instances of which exceeded the ten upon which Liefeld insisted. David also stated that some of these artists, such as [[John Byrne (comics)|John Byrne]] and [[George P\u00e9rez]], did not react to this practice on Liefeld's part as a \"tribute\", and expressed displeasure at the degree to which Liefeld relied on their work.<ref name=GiveCredit2/>\n\n===Production and business problems===\nLiefeld has also gained a reputation for producing late books, primarily his creator-owned ones,<ref name=GiveCredit1/><ref name=Newsarama/> though somewhat less so when doing [[work-for-hire]].<ref name=CBGUrbanLegends/> Some issues of his series ''[[Youngblood (comics)|Youngblood]]'' shipped as much as nine months late.

Carlson was working on ''Megaton'' #4, and was looking for replacements for artists who had moved on to bigger projects. Liefeld's submission packet consisted mostly of pinups of [[DC Comics]] characters like the [[Teen Titans]] and [[Legion of Super Heroes]], as well as some sketches of Megaton characters. Some of these earlier pinups are visible on Liefeld's website.<ref name=BigBangComics>[[Carlson, Gary]] (September 4, 2013).

Although Carlson liked Liefeld's work overall, he felt the young artist was not ready for professional work. Weeks later he received another set of samples that were an improvement, and later still, a four-page [[Berzerker (comics)|Berzerker]] story (not to be confused with the [[Berzerker (comics)|Marvel]] or [[Berserker (comics)|Top Cow]] characters of the same name), along with pinups of the Megaton characters Ultragirl and Ultraman.

Impressed with the artist's enthusiasm and the new art samples he showed them, Carlson gave Liefeld a test script in order to judge his ability to draw a page-to-page comics story.

At the convention, he showed editors his samples and offered a package, which consisted of 10 pages of sequential art featuring his own characters. Editor [[Dick Giordano]], to whom Liefeld showed his samples at the DC booth, requested that Liefeld send him more samples. Although Liefeld was apprehensive about approaching the Marvel booth, he did so at his friend's urging, and as a result, editor [[Mark Gruenwald]] offered Liefeld a job illustrating an eight-page ''[[The Avengers (comic book)|Avengers]]'' backup story featuring the [[Black Panther (comics)|Black Panther]], much to the 19-year-old artist's surprise. Though the published story was ultimately illustrated by another artist, Liefeld was later given character design work by the publisher. His first published story, was a [[DC Comics Bonus Book]] insert in ''[[Warlord (DC Comics)|Warlord]]'' #131 (September 1988). Editor [[Robert Greenberger]] recalled that Liefeld \"was discovered by my office-mate, Jonathan Peterson, who was scrambling to find something for him to do. I had the ''Warlord'' Bonus Book slot coming up, so to keep Rob from finding work at our rival, I tapped him for that.\"<ref>{{cite journal |last=Greenberger|first=Robert|authorlink=Robert Greenberger|title=New Talent and Bonus Babies|journal=[[Back Issue!]]|issue=71|page=72 |publisher=TwoMorrows Publishing|date=April 2014|location=Raleigh, North Carolina}}</ref> Next came the five-issue miniseries ''[[Hawk and Dove]]'' for DC Comics, the first issue of which was published with an October 1988 cover date.<ref name=CBGreats/><ref name=DCVisualChronicle/> It was this work that first garnered Liefeld visibility among readers of mainstream comics.<ref name=CBR.com7.30.01>Thomas, Michael (July 30, 2001).

Because this was done without editorial input, editor [[Mike Carlin]] cut and pasted the panels into the proper order, and [[Karl Kesel]] [[lightbox]]ed them onto DC comics paper to ink them. The letters column of ''Hawk and Dove'' #5 mentions that Liefeld \"showed something new to an editor who thought he'd seen everything.\" Liefeld explained this was how the dimension had been portrayed the only other time it had been featured in the book, although Kesel said this was untrue.<ref name=CBGUrbanLegends>{{cite web|url= http://goodcomics.comicbookresources.com/2006/02/02/comic-book-urban-legends-revealed-36/|title= Comic Book Urban Legends Revealed #36!|author=Cronin, Brian|date=February 2, 2006|publisher=CBR.com.}}</ref>\n\nShortly thereafter, Liefeld began doing work for Marvel Comics as well, his first assignment for them being ''[[The Amazing Spider-Man Annual]]'' #23.<ref name=CBGreats/> In 1989, Liefeld became the penciller for the Marvel series ''[[The New Mutants]]'', starting with issue #86.

''[[The Comics Journal]]''. pp. 3 \u2013 6.</ref> which underlined the increased popularity and clout that his stint on the title had earned him.<ref name=CBR.com7.30.01/>\n\nWith ''The New Mutants'' #98, Liefeld assumed full creative control over the series, penciling, inking, and plotting, with [[Fabian Nicieza]] writing dialog. The ''New Mutants'' series ended with issue 100, and was replaced with a revamped version of the team called ''[[X-Force]]'', whose 1991 debut issue sold four million copies, setting an industry-wide record later broken by [[Chris Claremont]] and [[Jim Lee]]'s ''X-Men'' (vol. 2) #1. The sales numbers were propelled by 1990s direct market sales strategies: [[Variant cover|five variant edition]] trading cards were [[polybag]]ged with ''X-Force'' #1 to encourage sales of multiple copies to single collectors, while ''X-Men'' #1 was sold with five variant covers. As of 2013, ''X-Force'' #1 remains the second highest-selling comic book in history.<ref name=CBR7.3.13/>\n\nIn mid-1990, [[Levi Strauss & Co.|Levi's]] began producing a series of TV commercials directed by [[Spike Lee]] for their 501 button fly jeans,<ref>Elliott, Stuart (July 22, 1991).

The exact title is unknown, but according to journalist Michael Dean, it was something to the effect of ''The X-Cutioners'', a title whose similarity to Marvel's X-Men family of titles evoked the ire of Marvel editor [[Bob Harras]], who threatened to fire Liefeld if he used that title.<ref>Dean, Michael.

In an interview in ''Hero Illustrated'' #4 (October 1993), Liefeld conceded disappointment with the first four issues of ''Youngblood'', calling the first issue a \"disaster\". Liefeld explained that production problems, as well as sub-par scripting by his friend and collaborator [[Hank Kanalz]], whose employment Liefeld later terminated, resulted in work that was lower in quality than that which Liefeld produced when [[Fabian Nicieza]] scripted his plots on ''X-Force'', and that reprints of those four issues would be re-scripted. Writer and ''[[Comics Buyer's Guide]]'' columnist [[Peter David]] pointed to Liefeld's scapegoating of Kanalz as an example of Liefeld's failure to take responsibility for his project, and evidence that genuine collaboration with good writers like Louise Simonson and Fabian Nicieza, which some of the Image founders did not appreciate, had previously reflected better on Liefeld's art.<ref name=CBR7.3.13/><ref name=CBR.com1.7.17/><ref name=GiveCredit1/>\n\nOther titles produced by Liefeld's Extreme Studios during the 1990s included ''[[Bloodstrike (Image Comics)|Bloodstrike]]'', ''[[Glory (comics)|Glory]]'', ''[[Prophet (comics)|Prophet]]'' and ''[[Avengelyne]]''.<ref>Dietsch, T.J.

The still-living Simon and Kirby's widow agreed to a figure Liefeld felt was too high, and he created a new similar character, Agent America. Simon threatened to sue, and the parties renegotiated a deal acceptable to all.

Peter David responded to this rationale by stating that DePalma himself was criticized harshly by film critics for employing Hitchcock's techniques, and that Liefeld, who has identified himself as a \"stickler\" for credit, did not credit artists whose work he copied, instances of which exceeded the ten upon which Liefeld insisted.

{"title_page": "Original Chip Set", "text_new": "{{more citations needed|date=April 2016}}\n{{Use American English|date=January 2016}}\n[[File:Amiga Original Chipset diagram.svg|thumb|350px|Amiga Chip Set]]\nThe '''Original Chip Set''' ('''OCS''') is a [[chipset]] used in the earliest [[Commodore International|Commodore]] [[Amiga]] computers and defined the Amiga's graphics and sound capabilities. It was succeeded by the slightly improved [[Enhanced Chip Set]] (ECS) and greatly improved [[Advanced Graphics Architecture]] (AGA).\n\nThe original chipset appeared in Amiga models built between 1985 and 1990: the [[Amiga&nbsp;1000]], [[Amiga&nbsp;2000]], [[Amiga&nbsp;CDTV]], and [[Amiga&nbsp;500]].\n\n==Overview of chips==\nThe chipset which gave the Amiga its unique graphics features consists of three main \"custom\" chips; ''Agnus'', ''Denise'', and ''Paula''. Both the original chipset and the enhanced chipset were manufactured using [[NMOS logic]] technology by [[Commodore International|Commodore]]'s [[Semiconductor fabrication|chip manufacturing]] subsidiary, [[MOS Technology]]. According to [[Jay Miner]], the OCS chipset was fabricated in 5&nbsp;\u00b5m manufacturing process while [[Amiga Advanced Graphics Architecture|AGA]] Lisa was implemented in 1.5&nbsp;\u00b5m process. All three custom chips were originally packaged in 48-pin [[Dual in-line package|DIP]]s; later versions of Agnus, known as Fat Agnus, were packaged in an 84-pin [[plastic leaded chip carrier|PLCC]].\n\n'''Agnus''' is the central chip in the design. It controls all access to [[chip RAM]] from both the central [[Motorola 68000|68000]] processor and the other custom chips, using a complicated priority system. Agnus includes sub-components known as the ''blitter'' (fast transfer of data in memory without the intervention of the processor) and the ''Copper'' (video-synchronized co-processor). The original Agnus can address {{nowrap|512 [[Kilobyte|KB]]}} of [[chip RAM]].  Later revisions, dubbed 'Fat Agnus', added {{nowrap|512 KB}} pseudo-fast RAM, which for ECS was changed to 1&nbsp;MB (sometimes called 'Fatter Agnus') and subsequently to 2&nbsp;MB chip RAM.\n\n'''Denise''' is the main video processor. Without using [[overscan]], the Amiga's graphics display is 320 or 640 [[pixel]]s wide by 200 ([[NTSC]]) or 256 ([[PAL]]) pixels tall. Denise also supports [[Interlaced video|interlacing]], which doubles the vertical resolution, at the cost of intrusive flickering on typical monitors of that era. [[Planar (computer graphics)|Planar]] [[bitmap graphics]] are used, which splits the individual [[bits per pixel]] into separate areas of memory, called [[bitplanes]]. In normal operation, Denise allows between one and five bitplanes, giving two to 32 unique colors. These colors are selected from a [[Palette (computing)|palette]] of 4096 colors (four bits per [[RGB]] component). A 6th bitplane is available for two special video modes: [[Halfbrite mode]] and [[Hold-And-Modify]] (HAM) mode. Denise also supports eight [[Sprite (computer graphics)|sprites]], single pixel scrolling, and a \"dual-playfield\" mode. Denise also handles mouse and digital joystick input.\n\n'''Paula''' is primarily the audio chip, with four independent hardware-mixed [[8-bit]] [[Pulse-code modulation|PCM]] sound channels, each of which supports 65<!--64?--> volume levels (no sound to maximum volume) and waveform output rates from roughly 20 samples per second to almost 29,000 samples per second. Paula also handles [[interrupts]] and various [[input/output|I/O]] functions including the [[floppy disk drive]], the [[serial port]], and [[analog joystick]]s.\n\nThere are many similarities{{snd}} both in overall functionality and in the division of functionality into the three component chips{{snd}} between the OCS chipset and the much earlier and simpler chipset of the [[Atari 8-bit family]] of home computers, consisting of the [[ANTIC]], [[Atari 8-bit TIA|GTIA]] and [[POKEY]] chips; both chipsets were conceptually designed by [[Jay Miner]], which explains the similarity.\n\n==Agnus==\n{{Main|MOS Technology Agnus}}\nThe Agnus chip is in overall control of the entire chipset's operation. All operations are synchronised to the position of the video beam. This includes access to the built-in [[Random Access Memory|RAM]], known as [[chip RAM]] because the chipset has access to it. Both the central [[68000]] processor and other members of the chipset have to arbitrate for access to chip RAM via ''Agnus''. In computing architecture terms, this is [[Direct Memory Access]] (DMA), where Agnus is the DMA Controller (DMAC).\n\nAgnus has a complex and priority-based memory access policy that attempts to best coordinate requests for memory access among competing resources. For example, bitplane data fetches are prioritized over blitter transfers as the immediate display of frame buffer data is considered more important than the processing of memory by the blitter. Agnus also attempts to order accesses in such a way so as to overlap CPU bus cycles with DMA cycles. As the original 68000 processor in Amigas tended only to access memory on every second available memory cycle, Agnus operates a system where \"odd\" memory access cycles are allocated first and as needed to time-critical custom chip DMA while any remaining cycles are available to the CPU, thus the CPU does not generally get locked out of memory access and does not appear to slow down. However, non-time-critical custom chip access, such as ''blitter'' transfers, can use up any spare odd or even cycles and, if the \"BLITHOG\" (blitter hog) flag is set, Agnus can lock out the even cycles from the [[Central processing unit|CPU]] in deference to the ''blitter''.\n\nAgnus's timings are measured in \"color clocks\" of 280&nbsp;[[nanosecond|ns]]. This is equivalent to two low resolution (140&nbsp;ns) pixels or four high resolution (70&nbsp;ns) pixels. Like Denise, these timings were designed for display on household [[Television|TV]]s, and can be synchronized to an external clock source.\n\n===Blitter===\nThe ''[[blitter]]'' is a sub-component of Agnus. \"Blit\" is shorthand for \"block image transfer\" or [[bit blit]]. The blitter is a highly parallel memory transfer and logic operation unit. It has three modes of operation: copying blocks of memory, filling blocks (e.g. polygon filling) and line drawing.\n\nThe blitter allows the rapid copying of video memory, meaning that the CPU can be freed for other tasks. The blitter was primarily used for drawing and redrawing graphics images on the screen, called \"bobs\", short for \"blitter objects\".\n\nThe blitter's block copying mode takes zero to three data sources in memory, called A, B and C, performs a programmable [[Boolean algebra (logic)|boolean]] function on the data sources and writes the result to a destination area, D. Any of these four areas can overlap. The blitter runs either from the start of the block to the end, known as \"ascending\" mode, or in reverse, \"descending\" mode.\n\nBlocks are \"rectangular\"; they have a \"width\" in multiples of 16 bits, a height measured in \"lines\", and a \"stride\" distance to move from the end of one line to the next. This allows the blitter to operate on any video resolution up to 1,024\u00d71,024 pixels.<ref>The ''BLTSIZE'' register holds six bits for horizontal words and ten bits for vertical lines.</ref> The copy automatically performs a per-pixel logical operation. These operations are described generically using [[minterms]]. This is most commonly used to do direct copies (D = A), or apply a pixel mask around blitted objects (D = (C AND B) OR A). The copy can also barrel shift each line by 0 to 15 pixels. This allows the blitter to draw at pixel offsets that are not exactly multiples of 16.\n\nThese functions allow the Amiga to move GUI windows around the screen rapidly as each is represented in graphical memory space as a rectangular block of memory which may be shifted to any required screen memory location at will.\n\nThe blitter's line mode draws single-pixel thick lines using [[Bresenham's line algorithm]]. It can also apply a [[16-bit]] repeating pattern to the line. The line mode can also be used to draw rotated bobs: each line of bob data is used as line pattern while the line mode draws the tilted bob line by line.\n\nThe blitter's filling mode is used to fill per-line horizontal spans. On each span, it reads each pixel in turn from right to left. Whenever it reads a set pixel, it toggles filling mode on or off. When filling mode is on, it sets every pixel until filling mode is turned off or the line ends. Together, these modes allow the blitter to draw individual flat-shaded polygons. Later Amigas tended to use a combination of a faster CPU and blitter for many operations.\n\n===Copper===\nThe ''Copper'' is another sub-component of Agnus; The name is short for \"co-processor\". The Copper is a programmable [[finite-state machine]] that executes a programmed instruction stream, synchronized with the video hardware.\n\nWhen it is turned on, the Copper has three states; either reading an instruction, executing it, or waiting for a specific video beam position. The Copper runs a program called the ''Copper list'' in parallel with the main [[Central processing unit|CPU]]. The Copper runs in sync with the video beam, and it can be used to perform various operations which require video synchronization. Most commonly it is used to control video output, but it can write to most of the chipset registers and thus can be used to initiate blits, set audio registers, or interrupt the CPU.\n\nThe Copper list has three kinds of instructions, each one being a pair of two bytes, four bytes in total:\n\n* The MOVE instruction writes a 16-bit value into one of the chipset's hardware registers and is also used to strobe a new address into the Copper's instruction pointer.\n* The WAIT instruction halts Copper execution until a given beam position is reached, thus making possible to synchronize other instructions with respect to screen drawing. It can also wait for a blitter operation to finish.\n* The SKIP instruction will skip the following Copper instruction if a given beam position has already been reached. This can be used to create Copper list loops.\n\nThe length of the Copper list program is limited by execution time. The Copper restarts executing the Copper list at the start of each new video frame. There is no explicit \"end\" instruction; instead, the WAIT instruction is used to wait for a location which is never reached.\n\n====Uses of the Copper====\n* The Copper is most commonly used to set and reset the video hardware registers at the beginning of each frame.\n* It can be used to change video settings mid-frame. This allows the Amiga to change video configuration, including resolution, between [[scanline]]s. This allows the Amiga to display different horizontal resolutions, different color depths, and entirely different frame buffers on the same screen. The [[AmigaOS]] graphical user interface allows two or more programs to operate at different resolutions in different buffers, while all are visible on the screen simultaneously. A paint program might use this feature to allow users to draw directly on a low resolution [[Hold-And-Modify]] (HAM) screen, while offering a high resolution toolbar at the top or bottom of the screen.\n* The Copper can also change color registers mid-frame, creating the \"[[raster bar]]s\" effect seen commonly in Amiga games. The Copper can go further than this and change the background color often enough to make a blocky graphics display without using any bitmap graphics at all.\n* The Copper allows \"re-use\" of sprites; after a sprite has been drawn at its programmed location, the Copper can then immediately move it to a new location and it will be drawn again, even on the same scanline.\n* The Copper can trigger an interrupt when the video beam reaches a precise location on the display. This is useful for synchronizing the CPU to the video beam.\n* The Copper can also be used to program and operate the blitter. This allows blitter operation and control to proceed independently of, and concurrently with, the CPU.\n* The Copper can be used to produce \"sliced [[Hold-And-Modify|HAM]]\", or S-HAM,<ref>Invented in 1989 by Rhett Anderson {{cite web |url=http://www.islandnet.com/~kpolsson/amigahis/amig1989.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2006-07-10 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060710012217/http://www.islandnet.com/~kpolsson/amigahis/amig1989.htm |archivedate=2006-07-10 }}</ref> this consists of building a Copper list that switches the palette on every scanline, improving the choice of base colors in [[Hold And Modify]] mode graphics.\n\n===External video timing===\nUnder normal circumstances, the Amiga generates its own video timings, but Agnus also supports synchronising the system to an external signal so as to achieve [[genlock]]ing with external video hardware. There is also a 1-bit output on this connector that indicates whether the Amiga is outputting background color or not, permitting easy overlaying of Amiga video onto external video. This made the Amiga particularly attractive as a character generator for titling videos and broadcast work, as it avoided the use and expense of [[AB roll]] and [[chromakey]] units that would be required without the genlock support. The support of overscan, interlacing and genlocking capabilities, and the fact that the display timing was very close to broadcast standards (NTSC or PAL), made the Amiga the first ideal computer for video purposes, and indeed, it was used in many studios for digitizing video data (sometimes called frame-grabbing), subtitling and interactive video news.\n\n==Denise==\nDenise is programmed to fetch [[Planar (computer graphics)|planar]] video data from one to five bitplanes and translate that into a [[color look-up table|color lookup]]. The number of bitplanes is arbitrary, thus if 32 colors are not needed, 2, 4, 8 or 16 can be used instead. The number of bitplanes (and resolution) can be changed on the fly, usually by the Copper. This allows for very economical use of RAM, and balancing of CPU processing speed vs graphical sophistication when executing from Chip RAM (as modes beyond 4bpp in lorez, or 2bpp in hires, use extra DMA channels that can slow or temporarily halt the CPU in addition to the usual non-conflicting channels). There can also be a sixth bitplane, which can be used in three special graphics modes:\n\nIn [[Halfbrite mode|Extra-HalfBrite]] (EHB), if a pixel is set on the sixth bitplane, the brightness of the regular 32 color pixel is halved. Early versions of the [[Amiga&nbsp;1000]] sold in the [[United States]] did not have the Extra-HalfBrite mode.<ref>[http://www.old-computers.com/museum/computer.asp?st=1&c=28 OLD-COMPUTERS.COM : The Museum<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>\n\nIn [[Hold-and-Modify]] (HAM) mode, each 6-bit pixel is interpreted as two control bits and four data bits. The four possible permutations of control bits are \"set\", \"modify red\", \"modify green\" and \"modify blue\". With \"set\", the four data bits act like a regular 16-color display look up. With one of the \"modify\"s, the red, green or blue component of the previous pixel is modified to the data value, and the other two components are held from the previous pixel. This allows all 4096 colors on screen at once and is an example of [[lossy compression|lossy image compression]] in hardware.\n\nIn dual-playfield mode, instead of acting as a single screen, two \"playfields\" of eight colors each (three bitplanes each) are drawn on top of each other. They are independently scrollable and the background color of the top playfield \"shines through\" to the underlying playfield.\n\nThere are two horizontal graphics resolutions, \"lowres\" with 140&nbsp;ns pixels and \"hires\" with 70&nbsp;ns pixels, with a default of 320 or 640 horizontal pixels wide without using overscan. As the pixel output is regulated by the main system clock, which is based directly on the NTSC colorburst clock, these sizes very nearly fill the width of a standard television with only a thin \"underscan\" border between the graphics and the screen border when compared to many other contemporary home computers, for an appearance closer to a games console but with finer detail. On top of this, Denise supports reasonably extensive overscan; technically modes with enough data for up to 400 or 800 pixels (+25%) may be specified, although this is only actually useful for scrolling and special effects that involve partial display of large graphics, as a separate hardware limit is met at 368 (or 736) pixels, which is the maximum that will fit between the end of one blanking period and the start of the next - although it is unlikely that even this many pixels will be visible on any display other than a dedicated monitor that allows adjustment of horizontal scan width, as much of the image will, by design, disappear seamlessly behind the screen bezel (or, on LCDs, be cropped off at the edge of the panel).<ref>[http://www.retroplatform.com/kb/19-115]</ref><ref>[http://amigadev.elowar.com/read/ADCD_2.1/Hardware_Manual_guide/node0085.html]</ref> Because of the highly regular structure of the Amiga's timing in relation to scanlines and allocation of DMA resources to various uses besides normal \"playfield\" graphics, increased horizontal resolution is also a tradeoff between number of pixels and how many hardware sprites are available, as increasing the DMA slots dedicated to playfield video ends up stealing some (from 1 to 7 of the total 8) the sprite engine.<cite>[http://amigadev.elowar.com/read/ADCD_2.1/Hardware_Manual_guide/node02D4.html]</cite>. Vertical resolution, without overscan, is 200 pixels for a 60&nbsp;Hz NTSC Amiga or 256 for a 50&nbsp;Hz PAL Amiga. This can be doubled using an [[interlaced video|interlace]]d display, and, as with horizontal resolution, increased using overscan, to a maximum of 241 (or 483) for NTSC, and 283 (567) for PAL (interlaced modes gaining one extra line as the maximum is determined by how many lines are taken from the available total by blanking and sync, and the total scanlines in non-interlaced modes are half the original, broadcast-spec odd-numbered interlaced counts, rounded down).\n\nDenise can composite up to eight 16 pixel wide [[sprite (computer graphics)|sprites]] per scan line (in automatic mode) on top, underneath, or between playfields, and detect collisions between sprites and the playfields or between sprites. These sprites have three visible colors and one transparent color. Optionally, adjacent pairs of sprites can be \"attached\" to make a single 15 color sprite. Using Copper or CPU register manipulations, each sprite 'channel' can be reused multiple times in a single frame to increase the total sprites per frame. Sprite ''position'' registers may also be changed during a scanline, increasing the total number of sprites on a single scanline. However, the sprite ''data'', or shape, is only fetched a single time per scanline and can't change. The first Amiga game to utilize the sprite re-position registers during a scanline was [[Hybris (video game)|Hybris]] released in 1988.\n\nFinally, Denise is responsible for handling mouse/joystick X/Y inputs.\n\n==Paula==\n[[File:Custom Chip Paula 8364 R4 used in Amiga 1000.jpg|thumb|220px|Paula chip (MOS Technology 8364 R4) used in Amiga&nbsp;1000]]\n[[File:CBM 8364R4 top metal.jpg|thumb|220px|Paula chip (MOS Technology 8364 R4) die]]\nThe Paula chip, from [[MOS Technology]], is the [[interrupt controller]], but also includes logic for audio playback, floppy disk drive control, serial port [[input/output]] and mouse/joystick buttons two and three signals. The logic remained functionally identical across all Amiga models from Commodore.\n\n===Audio===\nPaula has four [[Direct memory access|DMA]]-driven 8-bit [[Pulse-code modulation|PCM]] sample sound channels. Two sound channels are mixed into the left audio output, and the other two are mixed into the right output, producing [[Stereophonic sound|stereo]] audio output. The only supported hardware sample format is signed linear 8-bit [[two's complement]]. Each sound channel has an independent frequency and a 6-bit volume control (64 levels). Internally, the audio hardware is implemented by four state machines, each having eight different states.\n\nAdditionally the hardware allows one channel in a channel pair to modulate the other channel's period or amplitude. It is rarely used on the Amiga due to both frequency and volume being controllable in better ways, but could be used to achieve different kinds of [[tremolo]] and [[vibrato]], and even rudimentary [[Fm synth|FM synthesis]] effects.\n\nAudio may be output using two methods. Most often, DMA-driven audio is used. As explained in the discussion of Agnus, memory access is prioritized and one DMA slot per scan line is available for each of the four sound channels. On a regular NTSC or PAL display, DMA audio playback is limited to a maximum output rate of 28867 values per channel (PAL: 28837) per second totaling 57674 (PAL: 57734) values per second on each stereo output. This rate can be increased with the ECS and AGA chipsets by using a video mode with higher [[horizontal scan rate]].\n\nAlternately, Paula may signal the CPU to load a new sample into any of the four audio output buffers by generating an interrupt when a new sample is needed. This allows for output rates that exceed 57&nbsp;kHz per channel and increases the number of possible voices (simultaneous sounds) through software mixing.\n\nThe Amiga contains an analog [[low-pass filter]] ([[reconstruction filter]]) which is external to Paula. The filter is a 12&nbsp;dB/oct [[Butterworth filter|Butterworth]] low-pass filter at approximately 3.3&nbsp;kHz. The filter can only be applied globally to all four channels. In models after the Amiga&nbsp;1000 (excluding the very first revision of the Amiga&nbsp;500), the brightness of the power LED is used to indicate the status of the filter. The filter is active when the LED is at normal brightness, and deactivated when dimmed (on early Amiga&nbsp;500 models the LED went completely off). Models released before Amiga 1200 also have a static \"tone knob\" type low-pass filter that is enabled regardless of the optional \"LED filter\". This filter is a 6&nbsp;dB/oct low-pass filter with cutoff frequency at 4.5 or 5&nbsp;kHz.\n\nA software technique was later developed which can play back 14-bit audio by combining two channels set at different volumes. This results in two 14-bit channels instead of four 8-bit channels. This is achieved by playing the high byte of a 16-bit sample at maximum volume, and the low byte at minimum volume (both ranges overlap, so the low byte needs to be shifted right two bits). The bit shift operation requires a small amount of CPU or blitter overhead, whereas conventional 8-bit playback is almost entirely DMA driven. This technique was incorporated into the retargetable audio subsystem [[AHI (Amiga)|AHI]], allowing compatible applications to use this mode transparently.\n\n===Floppy disk controller===\nThe floppy controller is unusually flexible. It can read and write raw bit sequences directly from and to the disk via DMA or programmed I/O at 500 ([[double density]]) or 250&nbsp;kbit/s ([[single density]] or GCR). [[Modified Frequency Modulation|MFM]] or [[Group Coded Recording|GCR]] were the two most commonly used formats though in theory any [[run-length limited]] code could be used. It also provides a number of convenient features, such as sync-on-word (in MFM coding, $4489 is usually used as the [[sync word]]). MFM encoding/decoding is usually done with the blitter \u2014 one pass for decode, three passes for encode. Normally the entire track is read or written in one shot, rather than sector-by-sector; this made it possible to get rid of most of the inter-sector gaps that most floppy disk formats need to safely prevent the \"bleeding\" of a written sector into the previously-existing header of the next sector due to speed variations of the drive. If all sectors and their headers are always written in one go, such bleeding is only an issue at the end of the track (which still must not bleed back into its beginning), so that only one gap per track is needed. This way, for the native Amiga disk format, the raw storage capacity of 3.5&nbsp;inch DD disks was increased from the typical 720&nbsp;KB to 880&nbsp;KB, although the less-than-ideal [[Amiga Old File System|file system]] of the earlier Amiga models reduced this again to approximately 830&nbsp;KB of actual payload data.\n\nIn addition to the native 880&nbsp;KB 3.5-inch disk format, the controller can handle many foreign formats, such as:\n\n* [[IBM PC]]\n* [[Apple II]]\n* [[Macintosh|Mac]] 800&nbsp;KB (requires a Mac drive)\n* [[AMAX Mac emulator]] (a special floppy of only 200&nbsp;KB to exchange data between Amiga and Macintosh could be formatted by the Amiga, and it could be read and written by floppy drives of both systems)\n* [[Commodore 1541]] (requires 5\u00bc-inch drive slowed to 280&nbsp;rpm)\n* [[Commodore 1581]] formatted 3\u00bd-floppy for C64 and C128\n\nThe [[Amiga 3000]] introduced a special, dual-speed floppy drive that also allowed to use high density disks with double capacity without any change to Paula's floppy controller.\n\n===Serial port===\nThe serial port is rudimentary, using [[programmed input/output]] only and lacking a [[FIFO (computing and electronics)|FIFO]] buffer. However, virtually any bit rate can be selected, including all standard rates, [[MIDI]] rate, as well as extremely high custom rates.\n\n==Origin of the chip names==\n* The name Agnus is derived from 'Address GeNerator UnitS' since it houses all address registers and controls memory access of the custom chips.\n* Denise is a contrived contraction of Display ENabler, intended to continue the naming convention.\n* Paula is a similarly contrived contraction of Ports, Audio, [[UART]] and Logic, and coincidentally the chip designer's girlfriend.\n\n==Amiga graphics chipset roadmap==\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|- \n!

It was succeeded by the slightly improved [[Enhanced Chip Set]] (ECS) and greatly improved [[Advanced Graphics Architecture]] (AGA).\n\nThe original chipset appeared in Amiga models built between 1985 and 1990: the [[Amiga&nbsp;1000]], [[Amiga&nbsp;2000]], [[Amiga&nbsp;CDTV]], and [[Amiga&nbsp;500]].\n\n==Overview of chips==\nThe chipset which gave the Amiga its unique graphics features consists of three main \"custom\" chips; ''Agnus'', ''Denise'', and ''Paula''. Both the original chipset and the enhanced chipset were manufactured using [[NMOS logic]] technology by [[Commodore International|Commodore]]'s [[Semiconductor fabrication|chip manufacturing]] subsidiary, [[MOS Technology]]. According to [[Jay Miner]], the OCS chipset was fabricated in 5&nbsp;\u00b5m manufacturing process while [[Amiga Advanced Graphics Architecture|AGA]] Lisa was implemented in 1.5&nbsp;\u00b5m process. All three custom chips were originally packaged in 48-pin [[Dual in-line package|DIP]]s; later versions of Agnus, known as Fat Agnus, were packaged in an 84-pin [[plastic leaded chip carrier|PLCC]].\n\n'''Agnus''' is the central chip in the design. It controls all access to [[chip RAM]] from both the central [[Motorola 68000|68000]] processor and the other custom chips, using a complicated priority system. Agnus includes sub-components known as the ''blitter'' (fast transfer of data in memory without the intervention of the processor) and the ''Copper'' (video-synchronized co-processor). The original Agnus can address {{nowrap|512 [[Kilobyte|KB]]}} of [[chip RAM]].  Later revisions, dubbed 'Fat Agnus', added {{nowrap|512 KB}} pseudo-fast RAM, which for ECS was changed to 1&nbsp;MB (sometimes called 'Fatter Agnus') and subsequently to 2&nbsp;MB chip RAM.\n\n'''Denise''' is the main video processor. Without using [[overscan]], the Amiga's graphics display is 320 or 640 [[pixel]]s wide by 200 ([[NTSC]]) or 256 ([[PAL]]) pixels tall. Denise also supports [[Interlaced video|interlacing]], which doubles the vertical resolution, at the cost of intrusive flickering on typical monitors of that era. [[Planar (computer graphics)|Planar]] [[bitmap graphics]] are used, which splits the individual [[bits per pixel]] into separate areas of memory, called [[bitplanes]]. In normal operation, Denise allows between one and five bitplanes, giving two to 32 unique colors. These colors are selected from a [[Palette (computing)|palette]] of 4096 colors (four bits per [[RGB]] component). A 6th bitplane is available for two special video modes: [[Halfbrite mode]] and [[Hold-And-Modify]] (HAM) mode. Denise also supports eight [[Sprite (computer graphics)|sprites]], single pixel scrolling, and a \"dual-playfield\" mode. Denise also handles mouse and digital joystick input.\n\n'''Paula''' is primarily the audio chip, with four independent hardware-mixed [[8-bit]] [[Pulse-code modulation|PCM]] sound channels, each of which supports 65<!--64?--> volume levels (no sound to maximum volume) and waveform output rates from roughly 20 samples per second to almost 29,000 samples per second. Paula also handles [[interrupts]] and various [[input/output|I/O]] functions including the [[floppy disk drive]], the [[serial port]], and [[analog joystick]]s.\n\nThere are many similarities{{snd}} both in overall functionality and in the division of functionality into the three component chips{{snd}} between the OCS chipset and the much earlier and simpler chipset of the [[Atari 8-bit family]] of home computers, consisting of the [[ANTIC]], [[Atari 8-bit TIA|GTIA]] and [[POKEY]] chips; both chipsets were conceptually designed by [[Jay Miner]], which explains the similarity.\n\n==Agnus==\n{{Main|MOS Technology Agnus}}\nThe Agnus chip is in overall control of the entire chipset's operation. All operations are synchronised to the position of the video beam. This includes access to the built-in [[Random Access Memory|RAM]], known as [[chip RAM]] because the chipset has access to it. Both the central [[68000]] processor and other members of the chipset have to arbitrate for access to chip RAM via ''Agnus''. In computing architecture terms, this is [[Direct Memory Access]] (DMA), where Agnus is the DMA Controller (DMAC).\n\nAgnus has a complex and priority-based memory access policy that attempts to best coordinate requests for memory access among competing resources. For example, bitplane data fetches are prioritized over blitter transfers as the immediate display of frame buffer data is considered more important than the processing of memory by the blitter. Agnus also attempts to order accesses in such a way so as to overlap CPU bus cycles with DMA cycles. As the original 68000 processor in Amigas tended only to access memory on every second available memory cycle, Agnus operates a system where \"odd\" memory access cycles are allocated first and as needed to time-critical custom chip DMA while any remaining cycles are available to the CPU, thus the CPU does not generally get locked out of memory access and does not appear to slow down. However, non-time-critical custom chip access, such as ''blitter'' transfers, can use up any spare odd or even cycles and, if the \"BLITHOG\" (blitter hog) flag is set, Agnus can lock out the even cycles from the [[Central processing unit|CPU]] in deference to the ''blitter''.\n\nAgnus's timings are measured in \"color clocks\" of 280&nbsp;[[nanosecond|ns]]. This is equivalent to two low resolution (140&nbsp;ns) pixels or four high resolution (70&nbsp;ns) pixels. Like Denise, these timings were designed for display on household [[Television|TV]]s, and can be synchronized to an external clock source.\n\n===Blitter===\nThe ''[[blitter]]'' is a sub-component of Agnus. \"Blit\" is shorthand for \"block image transfer\" or [[bit blit]]. The blitter is a highly parallel memory transfer and logic operation unit. It has three modes of operation: copying blocks of memory, filling blocks (e.g. polygon filling) and line drawing.\n\nThe blitter allows the rapid copying of video memory, meaning that the CPU can be freed for other tasks. The blitter was primarily used for drawing and redrawing graphics images on the screen, called \"bobs\", short for \"blitter objects\".\n\nThe blitter's block copying mode takes zero to three data sources in memory, called A, B and C, performs a programmable [[Boolean algebra (logic)|boolean]] function on the data sources and writes the result to a destination area, D. Any of these four areas can overlap. The blitter runs either from the start of the block to the end, known as \"ascending\" mode, or in reverse, \"descending\" mode.\n\nBlocks are \"rectangular\"; they have a \"width\" in multiples of 16 bits, a height measured in \"lines\", and a \"stride\" distance to move from the end of one line to the next. This allows the blitter to operate on any video resolution up to 1,024\u00d71,024 pixels.<ref>The ''BLTSIZE'' register holds six bits for horizontal words and ten bits for vertical lines.</ref> The copy automatically performs a per-pixel logical operation. These operations are described generically using [[minterms]]. This is most commonly used to do direct copies (D = A), or apply a pixel mask around blitted objects (D = (C AND B) OR A). The copy can also barrel shift each line by 0 to 15 pixels. This allows the blitter to draw at pixel offsets that are not exactly multiples of 16.\n\nThese functions allow the Amiga to move GUI windows around the screen rapidly as each is represented in graphical memory space as a rectangular block of memory which may be shifted to any required screen memory location at will.\n\nThe blitter's line mode draws single-pixel thick lines using [[Bresenham's line algorithm]]. It can also apply a [[16-bit]] repeating pattern to the line. The line mode can also be used to draw rotated bobs: each line of bob data is used as line pattern while the line mode draws the tilted bob line by line.\n\nThe blitter's filling mode is used to fill per-line horizontal spans. On each span, it reads each pixel in turn from right to left. Whenever it reads a set pixel, it toggles filling mode on or off. When filling mode is on, it sets every pixel until filling mode is turned off or the line ends. Together, these modes allow the blitter to draw individual flat-shaded polygons. Later Amigas tended to use a combination of a faster CPU and blitter for many operations.\n\n===Copper===\nThe ''Copper'' is another sub-component of Agnus; The name is short for \"co-processor\". The Copper is a programmable [[finite-state machine]] that executes a programmed instruction stream, synchronized with the video hardware.\n\nWhen it is turned on, the Copper has three states; either reading an instruction, executing it, or waiting for a specific video beam position. The Copper runs a program called the ''Copper list'' in parallel with the main [[Central processing unit|CPU]]. The Copper runs in sync with the video beam, and it can be used to perform various operations which require video synchronization. Most commonly it is used to control video output, but it can write to most of the chipset registers and thus can be used to initiate blits, set audio registers, or interrupt the CPU.\n\nThe Copper list has three kinds of instructions, each one being a pair of two bytes, four bytes in total:\n\n* The MOVE instruction writes a 16-bit value into one of the chipset's hardware registers and is also used to strobe a new address into the Copper's instruction pointer.\n* The WAIT instruction halts Copper execution until a given beam position is reached, thus making possible to synchronize other instructions with respect to screen drawing. It can also wait for a blitter operation to finish.\n* The SKIP instruction will skip the following Copper instruction if a given beam position has already been reached. This can be used to create Copper list loops.\n\nThe length of the Copper list program is limited by execution time. The Copper restarts executing the Copper list at the start of each new video frame. There is no explicit \"end\" instruction; instead, the WAIT instruction is used to wait for a location which is never reached.\n\n====Uses of the Copper====\n* The Copper is most commonly used to set and reset the video hardware registers at the beginning of each frame.\n* It can be used to change video settings mid-frame. This allows the Amiga to change video configuration, including resolution, between [[scanline]]s. This allows the Amiga to display different horizontal resolutions, different color depths, and entirely different frame buffers on the same screen. The [[AmigaOS]] graphical user interface allows two or more programs to operate at different resolutions in different buffers, while all are visible on the screen simultaneously. A paint program might use this feature to allow users to draw directly on a low resolution [[Hold-And-Modify]] (HAM) screen, while offering a high resolution toolbar at the top or bottom of the screen.\n* The Copper can also change color registers mid-frame, creating the \"[[raster bar]]s\" effect seen commonly in Amiga games. The Copper can go further than this and change the background color often enough to make a blocky graphics display without using any bitmap graphics at all.\n* The Copper allows \"re-use\" of sprites; after a sprite has been drawn at its programmed location, the Copper can then immediately move it to a new location and it will be drawn again, even on the same scanline.\n* The Copper can trigger an interrupt when the video beam reaches a precise location on the display. This is useful for synchronizing the CPU to the video beam.\n* The Copper can also be used to program and operate the blitter. This allows blitter operation and control to proceed independently of, and concurrently with, the CPU.\n* The Copper can be used to produce \"sliced [[Hold-And-Modify|HAM]]\", or S-HAM,<ref>Invented in 1989 by Rhett Anderson {{cite web |url=http://www.islandnet.com/~kpolsson/amigahis/amig1989.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2006-07-10 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060710012217/http://www.islandnet.com/~kpolsson/amigahis/amig1989.htm |archivedate=2006-07-10 }}</ref> this consists of building a Copper list that switches the palette on every scanline, improving the choice of base colors in [[Hold And Modify]] mode graphics.\n\n===External video timing===\nUnder normal circumstances, the Amiga generates its own video timings, but Agnus also supports synchronising the system to an external signal so as to achieve [[genlock]]ing with external video hardware. There is also a 1-bit output on this connector that indicates whether the Amiga is outputting background color or not, permitting easy overlaying of Amiga video onto external video. This made the Amiga particularly attractive as a character generator for titling videos and broadcast work, as it avoided the use and expense of [[AB roll]] and [[chromakey]] units that would be required without the genlock support. The support of overscan, interlacing and genlocking capabilities, and the fact that the display timing was very close to broadcast standards (NTSC or PAL), made the Amiga the first ideal computer for video purposes, and indeed, it was used in many studios for digitizing video data (sometimes called frame-grabbing), subtitling and interactive video news.\n\n==Denise==\nDenise is programmed to fetch [[Planar (computer graphics)|planar]] video data from one to five bitplanes and translate that into a [[color look-up table|color lookup]]. The number of bitplanes is arbitrary, thus if 32 colors are not needed, 2, 4, 8 or 16 can be used instead. The number of bitplanes (and resolution) can be changed on the fly, usually by the Copper. This allows for very economical use of RAM, and balancing of CPU processing speed vs graphical sophistication when executing from Chip RAM (as modes beyond 4bpp in lorez, or 2bpp in hires, use extra DMA channels that can slow or temporarily halt the CPU in addition to the usual non-conflicting channels). There can also be a sixth bitplane, which can be used in three special graphics modes:\n\nIn [[Halfbrite mode|Extra-HalfBrite]] (EHB), if a pixel is set on the sixth bitplane, the brightness of the regular 32 color pixel is halved. Early versions of the [[Amiga&nbsp;1000]] sold in the [[United States]] did not have the Extra-HalfBrite mode.<ref>[http://www.old-computers.com/museum/computer.asp?st=1&c=28 OLD-COMPUTERS.COM : The Museum<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>\n\nIn [[Hold-and-Modify]] (HAM) mode, each 6-bit pixel is interpreted as two control bits and four data bits. The four possible permutations of control bits are \"set\", \"modify red\", \"modify green\" and \"modify blue\". With \"set\", the four data bits act like a regular 16-color display look up. With one of the \"modify\"s, the red, green or blue component of the previous pixel is modified to the data value, and the other two components are held from the previous pixel. This allows all 4096 colors on screen at once and is an example of [[lossy compression|lossy image compression]] in hardware.\n\nIn dual-playfield mode, instead of acting as a single screen, two \"playfields\" of eight colors each (three bitplanes each) are drawn on top of each other. They are independently scrollable and the background color of the top playfield \"shines through\" to the underlying playfield.\n\nThere are two horizontal graphics resolutions, \"lowres\" with 140&nbsp;ns pixels and \"hires\" with 70&nbsp;ns pixels, with a default of 320 or 640 horizontal pixels wide without using overscan. As the pixel output is regulated by the main system clock, which is based directly on the NTSC colorburst clock, these sizes very nearly fill the width of a standard television with only a thin \"underscan\" border between the graphics and the screen border when compared to many other contemporary home computers, for an appearance closer to a games console but with finer detail. On top of this, Denise supports reasonably extensive overscan; technically modes with enough data for up to 400 or 800 pixels (+25%) may be specified, although this is only actually useful for scrolling and special effects that involve partial display of large graphics, as a separate hardware limit is met at 368 (or 736) pixels, which is the maximum that will fit between the end of one blanking period and the start of the next - although it is unlikely that even this many pixels will be visible on any display other than a dedicated monitor that allows adjustment of horizontal scan width, as much of the image will, by design, disappear seamlessly behind the screen bezel (or, on LCDs, be cropped off at the edge of the panel).<ref>[http://www.retroplatform.com/kb/19-115]</ref><ref>[http://amigadev.elowar.com/read/ADCD_2.1/Hardware_Manual_guide/node0085.html]</ref> Because of the highly regular structure of the Amiga's timing in relation to scanlines and allocation of DMA resources to various uses besides normal \"playfield\" graphics, increased horizontal resolution is also a tradeoff between number of pixels and how many hardware sprites are available, as increasing the DMA slots dedicated to playfield video ends up stealing some (from 1 to 7 of the total 8) the sprite engine.<cite>[http://amigadev.elowar.com/read/ADCD_2.1/Hardware_Manual_guide/node02D4.html]</cite>. Vertical resolution, without overscan, is 200 pixels for a 60&nbsp;Hz NTSC Amiga or 256 for a 50&nbsp;Hz PAL Amiga. This can be doubled using an [[interlaced video|interlace]]d display, and, as with horizontal resolution, increased using overscan, to a maximum of 241 (or 483) for NTSC, and 283 (567) for PAL (interlaced modes gaining one extra line as the maximum is determined by how many lines are taken from the available total by blanking and sync, and the total scanlines in non-interlaced modes are half the original, broadcast-spec odd-numbered interlaced counts, rounded down).\n\nDenise can composite up to eight 16 pixel wide [[sprite (computer graphics)|sprites]] per scan line (in automatic mode) on top, underneath, or between playfields, and detect collisions between sprites and the playfields or between sprites. These sprites have three visible colors and one transparent color. Optionally, adjacent pairs of sprites can be \"attached\" to make a single 15 color sprite. Using Copper or CPU register manipulations, each sprite 'channel' can be reused multiple times in a single frame to increase the total sprites per frame. Sprite ''position'' registers may also be changed during a scanline, increasing the total number of sprites on a single scanline. However, the sprite ''data'', or shape, is only fetched a single time per scanline and can't change. The first Amiga game to utilize the sprite re-position registers during a scanline was [[Hybris (video game)|Hybris]] released in 1988.\n\nFinally, Denise is responsible for handling mouse/joystick X/Y inputs.\n\n==Paula==\n[[File:Custom Chip Paula 8364 R4 used in Amiga 1000.jpg|thumb|220px|Paula chip (MOS Technology 8364 R4) used in Amiga&nbsp;1000]]\n[[File:CBM 8364R4 top metal.jpg|thumb|220px|Paula chip (MOS Technology 8364 R4) die]]\nThe Paula chip, from [[MOS Technology]], is the [[interrupt controller]], but also includes logic for audio playback, floppy disk drive control, serial port [[input/output]] and mouse/joystick buttons two and three signals. The logic remained functionally identical across all Amiga models from Commodore.\n\n===Audio===\nPaula has four [[Direct memory access|DMA]]-driven 8-bit [[Pulse-code modulation|PCM]] sample sound channels. Two sound channels are mixed into the left audio output, and the other two are mixed into the right output, producing [[Stereophonic sound|stereo]] audio output. The only supported hardware sample format is signed linear 8-bit [[two's complement]]. Each sound channel has an independent frequency and a 6-bit volume control (64 levels). Internally, the audio hardware is implemented by four state machines, each having eight different states.\n\nAdditionally the hardware allows one channel in a channel pair to modulate the other channel's period or amplitude. It is rarely used on the Amiga due to both frequency and volume being controllable in better ways, but could be used to achieve different kinds of [[tremolo]] and [[vibrato]], and even rudimentary [[Fm synth|FM synthesis]] effects.\n\nAudio may be output using two methods. Most often, DMA-driven audio is used. As explained in the discussion of Agnus, memory access is prioritized and one DMA slot per scan line is available for each of the four sound channels. On a regular NTSC or PAL display, DMA audio playback is limited to a maximum output rate of 28867 values per channel (PAL: 28837) per second totaling 57674 (PAL: 57734) values per second on each stereo output. This rate can be increased with the ECS and AGA chipsets by using a video mode with higher [[horizontal scan rate]].\n\nAlternately, Paula may signal the CPU to load a new sample into any of the four audio output buffers by generating an interrupt when a new sample is needed. This allows for output rates that exceed 57&nbsp;kHz per channel and increases the number of possible voices (simultaneous sounds) through software mixing.\n\nThe Amiga contains an analog [[low-pass filter]] ([[reconstruction filter]]) which is external to Paula. The filter is a 12&nbsp;dB/oct [[Butterworth filter|Butterworth]] low-pass filter at approximately 3.3&nbsp;kHz. The filter can only be applied globally to all four channels. In models after the Amiga&nbsp;1000 (excluding the very first revision of the Amiga&nbsp;500), the brightness of the power LED is used to indicate the status of the filter. The filter is active when the LED is at normal brightness, and deactivated when dimmed (on early Amiga&nbsp;500 models the LED went completely off). Models released before Amiga 1200 also have a static \"tone knob\" type low-pass filter that is enabled regardless of the optional \"LED filter\". This filter is a 6&nbsp;dB/oct low-pass filter with cutoff frequency at 4.5 or 5&nbsp;kHz.\n\nA software technique was later developed which can play back 14-bit audio by combining two channels set at different volumes. This results in two 14-bit channels instead of four 8-bit channels. This is achieved by playing the high byte of a 16-bit sample at maximum volume, and the low byte at minimum volume (both ranges overlap, so the low byte needs to be shifted right two bits). The bit shift operation requires a small amount of CPU or blitter overhead, whereas conventional 8-bit playback is almost entirely DMA driven. This technique was incorporated into the retargetable audio subsystem [[AHI (Amiga)|AHI]], allowing compatible applications to use this mode transparently.\n\n===Floppy disk controller===\nThe floppy controller is unusually flexible. It can read and write raw bit sequences directly from and to the disk via DMA or programmed I/O at 500 ([[double density]]) or 250&nbsp;kbit/s ([[single density]] or GCR). [[Modified Frequency Modulation|MFM]] or [[Group Coded Recording|GCR]] were the two most commonly used formats though in theory any [[run-length limited]] code could be used. It also provides a number of convenient features, such as sync-on-word (in MFM coding, $4489 is usually used as the [[sync word]]). MFM encoding/decoding is usually done with the blitter \u2014 one pass for decode, three passes for encode. Normally the entire track is read or written in one shot, rather than sector-by-sector; this made it possible to get rid of most of the inter-sector gaps that most floppy disk formats need to safely prevent the \"bleeding\" of a written sector into the previously-existing header of the next sector due to speed variations of the drive. If all sectors and their headers are always written in one go, such bleeding is only an issue at the end of the track (which still must not bleed back into its beginning), so that only one gap per track is needed. This way, for the native Amiga disk format, the raw storage capacity of 3.5&nbsp;inch DD disks was increased from the typical 720&nbsp;KB to 880&nbsp;KB, although the less-than-ideal [[Amiga Old File System|file system]] of the earlier Amiga models reduced this again to approximately 830&nbsp;KB of actual payload data.\n\nIn addition to the native 880&nbsp;KB 3.5-inch disk format, the controller can handle many foreign formats, such as:\n\n* [[IBM PC]]\n* [[Apple II]]\n* [[Macintosh|Mac]] 800&nbsp;KB (requires a Mac drive)\n* [[AMAX Mac emulator]] (a special floppy of only 200&nbsp;KB to exchange data between Amiga and Macintosh could be formatted by the Amiga, and it could be read and written by floppy drives of both systems)\n* [[Commodore 1541]] (requires 5\u00bc-inch drive slowed to 280&nbsp;rpm)\n* [[Commodore 1581]] formatted 3\u00bd-floppy for C64 and C128\n\nThe [[Amiga 3000]] introduced a special, dual-speed floppy drive that also allowed to use high density disks with double capacity without any change to Paula's floppy controller.\n\n===Serial port===\nThe serial port is rudimentary, using [[programmed input/output]] only and lacking a [[FIFO (computing and electronics)|FIFO]] buffer. However, virtually any bit rate can be selected, including all standard rates, [[MIDI]] rate, as well as extremely high custom rates.\n\n==Origin of the chip names==\n* The name Agnus is derived from 'Address GeNerator UnitS' since it houses all address registers and controls memory access of the custom chips.\n* Denise is a contrived contraction of Display ENabler, intended to continue the naming convention.\n* Paula is a similarly contrived contraction of Ports, Audio, [[UART]] and Logic, and coincidentally the chip designer's girlfriend.\n\n==Amiga graphics chipset roadmap==\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|- \n!

He has expressed this as a utopian ideal, approached in practice by increasing production quantities to cut costs and by using mail-order,<ref>\"So it is absolutely possible to talk about a utopian project with Starck\", Beno\u00eet Heilbrunn, Starck in Words, 2003</ref> via [[3 Suisses|Les 3 Suisses]].
