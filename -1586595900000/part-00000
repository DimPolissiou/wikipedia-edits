Davies]], Avro chief designer. The diminutive experimental aircraft initially incorporated a wing with about 50\u00b0 sweep, without a horizontal tail on a fin with trailing edge sweep. The trailing edge of the wing carried two pairs of control surfaces: inboard [[elevator (aircraft)|elevators]] and outboard [[aileron]]s.

The 707B was given the same dorsal engine intake as the 707, although this was later modified to a [[NACA duct|NACA]] design. It first flew on 6 September 1950. Both these aircraft were built to test low speed characteristics.\n\nThe third aircraft, designated '''707A''', ''WD280'' was built for higher speed testing. Experience with the dorsal intake of the earlier 707 and 707B had shown that as speed increased, the cockpit induced turbulence which interrupted the intake airflow, so the intakes were moved to the wing roots.<ref name=\"Harlin and Jenks p. 176\">Harlin and Jenks 1973, p. 176.</ref> When the Vulcan appeared, it looked very much like an enlarged 707A. Later, this 707A was used to test the compound leading edge sweep subsequently used on all Vulcans. Although the first Vulcan prototype was already flying, a second 707A ''WZ736'' was built to speed the development programme, making its maiden fight on 20 February 1953.\n\nThe final variant was the two-seat '''707C'''; originally four examples were ordered by the RAF for use in orientation training revolving around flying aircraft with delta wing configurations. The 707C had \"side-by-side\" seating with dual-controls but the production order was cancelled with only the sole prototype, ''WZ744'' built.<ref name=\"Harlin and Jenks p. 176\"/> The 707C had its maiden flight on 1 July 1953 and was ultimately employed in other research that did not involve Vulcan development.<ref name=\"Buttler p. 55\">Buttler 2007, p. 55.</ref>\n\n[[File:Avro Vulcan VX770 VX777 FAR 13.09.53 edited-2.jpg|thumb|right|Two Avro 707As, a 707B and a 707C with both Vulcan prototypes at the SBAC [[Farnborough Air Show]] in September 1953]]\n\nEven after the Vulcan development phase was over, the four surviving 707s, in individual bright blue, red, orange and silver (natural metal) colour schemes, continued in use as research aircraft.<ref name=\"Buttler p. 55\"/> After the compound sweep investigation<ref>Jackson 1965, p. 423.</ref> and a period with the [[Royal Aircraft Establishment]] (R.A.E) carrying out handling trials with powered controls,<ref name=\"Cooper p.108\">Cooper 2006, p. 108.</ref> the first 707A went to the Aeronautical Research Laboratories in Australia for low-speed delta wing airflow measurements.

Later, this 707A was used to test the compound leading edge sweep subsequently used on all Vulcans. Although the first Vulcan prototype was already flying, a second 707A ''WZ736'' was built to speed the development programme, making its maiden fight on 20 February 1953.\n\nThe final variant was the two-seat '''707C'''; originally four examples were ordered by the RAF for use in orientation training revolving around flying aircraft with delta wing configurations. The 707C had \"side-by-side\" seating with dual-controls but the production order was cancelled with only the sole prototype, ''WZ744'' built.<ref name=\"Harlin and Jenks p. 176\"/> The 707C had its maiden flight on 1 July 1953 and was ultimately employed in other research that did not involve Vulcan development.<ref name=\"Buttler p. 55\">Buttler 2007, p. 55.</ref>\n\n[[File:Avro Vulcan VX770 VX777 FAR 13.09.53 edited-2.jpg|thumb|right|Two Avro 707As, a 707B and a 707C with both Vulcan prototypes at the SBAC [[Farnborough Air Show]] in September 1953]]\n\nEven after the Vulcan development phase was over, the four surviving 707s, in individual bright blue, red, orange and silver (natural metal) colour schemes, continued in use as research aircraft.<ref name=\"Buttler p. 55\"/> After the compound sweep investigation<ref>Jackson 1965, p. 423.</ref> and a period with the [[Royal Aircraft Establishment]] (R.A.E) carrying out handling trials with powered controls,<ref name=\"Cooper p.108\">Cooper 2006, p. 108.</ref> the first 707A went to the Aeronautical Research Laboratories in Australia for low-speed delta wing airflow measurements.

The Ugandans met light resistance and in November President [[Idi Amin]] of Uganda announced the annexation of all Tanzanian land north of the [[Kagera River]]. The Tanzanians organised a [[counter-offensive]] later in November and successfully ejected the Ugandan forces from their country.\n\nRelations between Tanzania and Uganda had been tense since then-Colonel Amin overthrew Ugandan President [[Milton Obote]] in 1971. Tanzanian President [[Julius Nyerere]] supported Obote and backed an unsuccessful attempt by him to regain power in 1972. Uganda also disputed its border with Tanzania, claiming that the Kagera Salient\u2014a {{convert|1865|km2}} stretch of land between the official border and the Kagera River {{convert|29|km}} to the south\u2014should be ceded to Uganda. Tensions remained high through 1978, when Amin's regime started rapidly declining due to economic problems and dissent in the armed forces. In early October Ugandan forces began making small incursions into the Kagera region. On 25 October the [[Uganda Army (1971\u20131980)|Uganda Army]] launched a large attack over the border, but was repulsed by Tanzanian artillery. The Ugandans attacked again on 30 October, quickly overwhelming the small Tanzanian contingent in the region and completely occupying the Kagera Salient. Amin declared that Uganda was annexing the region, and shortly thereafter the Ugandans destroyed the only bridge over the Kagera River, easing their commanders' concerns about a Tanzanian counter-offensive. The Uganda Army pillaged the land, stealing cattle, automobiles, and personal belongings from homes. Approximately 1,500 civilians were shot and killed, and thousands more fled south.\n\nTanzania was caught unprepared for war but Nyerere\u2014after being assured by his commanders of his country's military capability to react\u2014ordered a [[mobilisation]] and instructed the [[Tanzania People's Defence Force]] (TPDF) to prepare a counter-offensive. Mozambique sent a [[battalion]] to Tanzania as a gesture of support. The [[Organisation of African Unity]] attempted to foster a diplomatic solution but Nyerere rejected attempts at mediation. Uganda Army officers concentrated on looting and ignored intelligence reports of Tanzanian plans, and thus were caught unprepared when the TPDF initiated Operation Chakaza. Most Ugandan soldiers fled in the face of artillery bombardment, and Amin soon thereafter declared that he was unconditionally withdrawing the Uganda Army from Kagera, a claim which was bitterly contested by Tanzania. Tanzanian troops used [[pontoon bridge|pontoons]] and a [[Bailey bridge]] to move heavy equipment across the river and probed the area. By January 1979 the TPDF had re-secured the Kagera Salient. Nyerere did not initially intend on expanding the war beyond expelling the Ugandans from Tanzanian territory. After Amin failed to renounce his claims to Kagera and the OAU failed to condemn the Ugandan invasion, Nyerere ordered the TPDF to attack Uganda, resulting in Amin's overthrow in April. Following the conclusion of the war, the Tanzanian government undertook efforts to rehabilitate Kagera, but social services and the standard of living for locals remained diminished for many years. The Uganda\u2013Tanzania War is remembered in Tanzania as the Kagera War.\n\n== Background ==\n[[File:Idi Amin cropped.jpg|thumb|left|[[Idi Amin]] (pictured) became the [[President of Uganda]] following [[1971 Ugandan coup d'\u00e9tat|a 1971 coup]].]]\n\nIn 1971 Colonel [[Idi Amin]] launched [[1971 Ugandan coup d'\u00e9tat|a military coup]] that overthrew the [[President of Uganda]], [[Milton Obote]], precipitating a deterioration of relations with neighbouring Tanzania.<ref name= honey2/> [[President of Tanzania|Tanzanian President]] [[Julius Nyerere]] had close ties with Obote and had supported his [[Socialism|socialist]] orientation.{{sfn|Roberts|2017|p=155}} Amin installed himself as President of Uganda and ruled the country under a repressive dictatorship.<ref name= honey2>{{cite news| last = Honey| first = Martha| title = Ugandan Capital Captured| newspaper = The Washington Post| date = 12 April 1979| url = https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/politics/1979/04/12/ugandan-capital-captured/1eb604a7-5ff0-4c51-9fa0-527169e5bffa/?noredirect=on|access-date=7 November 2018}}</ref> Nyerere withheld diplomatic recognition of the new government and offered asylum to Obote and his supporters.{{sfn|Roberts|2017|p=155}} Uganda twice launched military attacks against the Tanzanian border that year.{{sfn|Avirgan|Honey|1983|p=35}} With the approval of Nyerere, Ugandan exiles organised a small army of [[Guerrilla warfare|guerrillas]], and attempted, unsuccessfully, to invade Uganda and remove Amin in 1972.{{efn|Nyerere authorised the attack after hearing rumours of a plot by Uganda and [[Portuguese Mozambique]] to invade Tanzania and depose him.{{sfn|Avirgan|Honey|1983|p=35}}}} Amin blamed Nyerere for backing and arming his enemies,{{sfn|Cooper|Fontanellaz|2015|pp=6\u20137}} and retaliated by bombing Tanzanian border towns. Though his commanders urged him to respond in kind, Nyerere agreed to mediation overseen by the [[President of Somalia]], [[Siad Barre]], resulting in the signing of the [[Mogadishu Agreement]], which stipulated that Ugandan and Tanzanian forces had to withdraw to positions at least 10 kilometres away from the border and refrain from supporting opposition forces that targeted each other's governments. Nevertheless, relations between the two presidents remained tense; Nyerere frequently denounced Amin's regime, and Amin made repeated threats to invade Tanzania. During the same time, relations between Tanzania and [[Kenya]] grew sour, and the [[East African Community]] subsequently collapsed.{{sfn|Roberts|2017|p=155}} Uganda also disputed its border with Tanzania, claiming that the [[Kagera Region|Kagera]] Salient\u2014a {{convert|1865|km2}} stretch of land between the official border and the [[Kagera River]] 29 kilometres (18 miles) to the south\u2014should be ceded to Uganda, maintaining that the river made for a more logical border. The border had originally been negotiated by British and German colonial officials before [[World War I]].<ref name= darnton1/>\n\nMeanwhile, in Uganda, Amin announced an \"Economic War\" in which thousands of [[Expulsion of Asians from Uganda|Asian immigrants were expelled]] from the country and their businesses placed under the management of Africans. The reform had disastrous consequences for the economy, which were further exacerbated by a United States boycott of Ugandan coffee on account of the government's failure to respect [[human rights]].{{sfn|Roberts|2017|p=155}} At the same time, Amin expanded the power of the armed forces in his government, placing many soldiers in his cabinet and providing those loyal to him with [[patronage]]. Most of the beneficiaries of his actions were Muslim northerners, particularly those of [[Nubians|Nubian]] and Sudanese extract, who were increasingly recruited into the army.{{sfn|Roberts|2017|pp=155\u2013156}} Amin violently purged members of southern ethnic groups from the armed forces and executed political opponents.{{sfn|Roberts|2017|p=156}} In 1977 a split in the [[Uganda Army (1971\u20131980)|Uganda Army]] developed between supporters of Amin and soldiers loyal to the [[Vice President of Uganda]], [[Mustafa Adrisi]], who held significant power in the government and wanted to purge foreigners from the military. In April 1978 Adrisi was severely injured in a suspicious car accident. When he was flown out of the country for treatment, Amin stripped him of his ministerial portfolios. He also announced the arrest of multiple police officials, and during the following month he dismissed several ministers and military officers.{{sfn|Avirgan|Honey|1983|pp=49\u201350}} The shakeup strained Amin's narrow base of power in the military that had been declining in the face of the worsening economic situation, which eliminated patronage opportunities.{{sfn|Roberts|2017|p=156}} Fearing for his personal safety and less confident in his charismatic abilities to diffuse the growing tension, Amin began withdrawing from the public sphere and conducting less visits with his troops. At around the same time he began accusing Tanzania of violating Uganda's border.{{sfn|Avirgan|Honey|1983|p=51}} In May, Amin falsely claimed that Tanzanian troops had attacked the [[Rakai District]].{{sfn|Hooper|1999|p=42}} He also appealed to his allies, President [[Gaafar Nimeiry]] of Sudan and leader [[Muammar Gaddafi]] of [[History of Libya under Muammar Gaddafi|Libya]] to intervene and resolve the \"potentially explosive\" situation, claiming that Tanzanian forces were moving within 4.8 kilometres (three miles) of Ugandan border towns. In July, [[Radio Uganda]] erroneously declared that Obote was planning another Tanzanian-supported overthrow attempt. Nyerere ignored the allegations.{{sfn|Avirgan|Honey|1983|p=51}}\n\nIn reality, since May, Ugandan troops and military equipment had been shifted towards the border at Amin's direction and in violation of the Mogadishu Agreement.{{sfn|Cooper|Fontanellaz|2015|p=22}} Only one Tanzanian [[Company (military unit)|company]] was near the border region and Obote's irregular troops were in a refugee camp.{{sfn|Avirgan|Honey|1983|p=51}} In July, [[Brigadier]] Yusuf Himid of the [[Tanzania People's Defence Force]] (TPDF) warned Uganda to cease its \"repeated provocations\" against Tanzania.{{sfn|Avirgan|Honey|1983|pp=51\u201352}} As tensions with Tanzania increased, a number of Amin's high-ranking military commanders began to advocate war with the neighbouring state. They were opposed by other Ugandan generals who argued that Uganda Army was not ready for an open conflict.

Among the incidents identified as possible start points for the war are cases of cattle rustling, tribal tensions, a fight between a Ugandan woman and a Tanzanian woman at a market,{{sfn|Rice|2003|p=11}} as well as a bar fight between a Ugandan soldier and Tanzanian soldiers or civilians.<ref>{{cite web| url = http://www.monitor.co.ug/Magazines/PeoplePower/Pilot-Omita-MiG21-AminTanzania-Juma-Butabika/689844-4129682-lwlpbkz/index.html | title = Pilot Omita parachutes out of burning MiG-21 | date = 9 October 2017| website = Daily Monitor | access-date = 14 October 2018}}</ref><ref name=barfight/> Several Ugandan soldiers who endorsed the bar fight theory disagreed on the confrontation's exact circumstances, but agreed that the incident occurred on 9 October in a Tanzanian establishment.

That evening Radio Uganda declared that the Tanzanians had abducted a Ugandan soldier, and reported that Amin threatened to do \"something\" if he was not returned.{{sfn|Avirgan|Honey|1983|pp=57\u201358}}\n\nAnother theory describes the invasion as the result of Ugandan troops chasing mutineers over the Tanzanian border. There are several different variations of this account, which were mostly circulated by non-Ugandan sources.{{sfn|Mambo|Schofield|2007|p=312}} Ugandan diplomat [[Paul Eitang]] and the local managing director for [[Royal Dutch Shell]] reported that soldiers of the Simba Battalion had shot new Sudanese recruits and that when other Ugandan forces were sent to contain them, they fled over the border on 30 October.{{sfn|Roberts|2017|pp=156\u2013157}} ''[[The New York Times]]'' reporter [[John Darnton]] pieced together several refugee accounts which suggested that Amin had possibly planned an invasion of Tanzania to purge followers of Adrisi from the military. Accordingly, the invasion was intended as suicide mission, and any returning troops would be killed upon reentering Uganda. When Simba Battalion deputy commander Lieutenant Colonel Juma Adek was ordered to prepare for the invasion, he suspected the President's plan and mutinied with some of his troops, attacking Sudanese members of the Simba Battalion.<ref name= darnton4/> Other versions attribute the mutinies to elements of the Chui Battalion or the Suicide Battalion.{{sfn|Mambo|Schofield|2007|p=312}} Ugandan historian Phares Mukasa Mutibwa argued that the Simba Battalion initially mutinied under the influence of officers who wanted to restore a civilian government. When Amin sent the Chui Battalion to crush the rebellion, the unit joined the mutineers. He then ordered the Marine Regiment and new recruits to crush the urprising, but they failed.<ref>{{cite web| url = https://www.independent.co.ug/how-unity-died-in-uganda/| title = How 'unity' died in Uganda | date = 8 April 2019| website = The Indepedent (Kampala)| access-date = 7 March 2020 }}</ref> Political scientist Okon Eminue stated that about 200 mutineers \"reportedly\" took refuge in the Kagera salient.{{sfn|Eminue|2010|p=99}} According to this version of events, Amin ordered the Simba Battalion and the Suicide Battalion to pursue the deserters, resulting in the invasion of Tanzania.{{sfn|Eminue|2010|p=99}} A Ugandan soldier interviewed by ''[[Drum (South African magazine)|Drum]]'' claimed that the initial actions of the invasion were in fact a three-way fight between loyalist Uganda Army soldiers, Ugandan deserters, and Tanzanian border guards, with most of the deserters and a number of Tanzanians being killed.{{sfn|Seftel|2010|pp=223\u2013224}} A few surviving mutineers reportedly found shelter in Tanzanian villages.{{sfn|Seftel|2010|p=224}} Researchers Andrew Mambo and Julian Schofield discounted this theory as unlikely, noting that the battalions that are said to have mutinied remained relatively loyal to Amin's cause throughout the war, and instead supported the notion that Butabika escalated a dispute at the border into an invasion.{{sfn|Mambo|Schofield|2007|pp=312\u2013313}}\n\nThe TPDF had received only very limited intelligence about a possible Ugandan invasion, and was unprepared for this eventuality, as the Tanzanian leadership generally believed that Amin would not consider attacking Tanzania while his own country was affected by political, economic, and military instability.{{sfn|Seftel|2010|p=220}} Even beyond the demilitarised zone established by the Mogadishu Agreement, there were almost no defences. Tanzania had tense relations with [[Zaire]], Kenya, and Malawi, and the only forces defending the land along the Ugandan border was the 202nd Brigade based in [[Tabora]]. It was led by an elderly commander, Brigadier Himid. Near the frontier was the understrength 3rd Battalion, led by Lieutenant Colonel Morris Singano. Its main responsibilities were to conduct reconnaissance and combat smuggling. In early September the Tanzanians reported unusually large numbers of Ugandan patrols near the border\u2014some equipped with [[armoured personnel carrier]]s\u2014and a high volume of air reconnaissance flights. By the middle of the month the Ugandan aircraft began crossing into Tanzanian airspace.{{sfn|Avirgan|Honey|1983|p=53}} Singano reported the unusual activity to the brigade headquarters in Tabora, and was assured that anti-aircraft guns would be sent to him.

A Tanzanian observation post witnessed the event and contacted Singano via radio, who subsequently ordered his artillery to open fire on Ugandan positions. A Ugandan armoured personnel carrier and truck were destroyed, and two soldiers were killed. Ugandan artillery returned fire but caused no damage.

They were brought into action four days later, and the Ugandan guns subsequently stopped firing. Over the next few days both sides exchanged artillery fire, gradually expanding across the whole border. Tanzanian leaders felt that Amin was only making provocations. Singano sent increasingly urgent requests for help, and was eventually told that reinforcements would be sent.{{sfn|Avirgan|Honey|1983|p=54}}\n\nOn 18 October Ugandan MiGs bombed [[Bukoba]], the capital of the [[Kagera Region|West Lake Region]]. Despite facing ineffectual Tanzanian anti-aircraft fire, the bombings caused little damage, but the explosions shattered windows caused panic.{{sfn|Avirgan|Honey|1983|p=54}} The following day West Lake Regional Commissioner Mohamed Kissoky hosted a meeting with government and [[Chama Cha Mapinduzi]] (CCM, the state political party) officials. He told them that the border conflict was the result of a misunderstanding and encouraged them to reiterate that \"we are great friends with Uganda, and Idi Amin has been at that border shaking hands with our people.\"{{sfn|Avirgan|Honey|1983|p=56}} Despite Kissoky's appeal for calm, Bukoba residents continued to panic, their anxieties worsened by exaggerated stories of battles from fleeing villagers from the north. Aside from Kissoky, Tanzanian leaders did not make any public comments about the conflict, and [[Radio Tanzania Dar es Salaam|Radio Tanzania]] did not report on it. In contrast, Radio Uganda reported a Tanzanian \"invasion\" of Ugandan territory with accounts of fictional battles, and detailed that Tanzanian troops had advanced 15 kilometres (9.3 miles) into Uganda, killing civilians and destroying property. Amin told residents in Mutukula that in spite of the \"attack\", he still hoped for good relations with Tanzania. At the same time, Radio Uganda's Kinyankole language broadcasts\u2014which were closely monitored and understood by West Lake residents\u2014severely criticised Nyerere and claimed that Tanzanians wished to fall under Ugandan jurisdiction to escape the former's rule.{{sfn|Avirgan|Honey|1983|p=56}} Meanwhile, the Ugandan regime came under increased internal strain.

Several minutes later three other observation posts reported Ugandan manoeuvres on the other side of the border. Singano went to a hill near Kyaka from where he witnessed Ugandan artillery open fire. Fifteen minutes later he received a radio message from an understrength [[platoon]] of 20 TPDF soldiers opposite Mutukula, who reported that they were under attack and exchanging heavy fire with the Uganda Army. All other Tanzanian soldiers broke under fire and fled towards the Kagera River.

Marajani reported heavy resistance despite the fact that all TPDF personnel had withdrawn from the border area. Believing that his enemies were confused about the situation, at mid-morning Singano ordered an artillery unit to the front to put up resistance. It was equipped with 122{{nbs}}mm (4.8{{nbs}}in) mortars, a 120{{nbs}}mm (4.7{{nbs}}in) [[howitzer]], and a few 85{{nbs}}mm (3.3{{nbs}}in) guns.{{sfn|Avirgan|Honey|1983|pp=58\u201359}} Stationed in the area around Bumazi,{{sfn|Cooper|Fontanellaz|2015|p=24}} the unit set up its artillery {{convert|10|km}} from the Ugandans and fired several shells, causing them to retreat across the border.{{efn|According to Ugandan sources, the first attack on Kagera was repelled after one day had passed.{{sfn|Cooper|Fontanellaz|2015|p=24}} }} Throughout the rest of the day Ugandan MiGs crossed into Tanzanian airspace, where they were harassed by inconsequential anti-aircraft fire.

Realising the veracity of Singano's warnings in light of the action, Tanzanian commanders dispatched a six-strong anti-aircraft team equipped with [[9K32 Strela-2|SA-7]] shoulder-fired [[heat-seeking missile]]s from Tabora to the front.{{sfn|Cooper|Fontanellaz|2015|p=25}}{{sfn|Avirgan|Honey|1983|pp=59\u201360}} The unit arrived in Bukoba on 27 October. Shortly before its arrival, three MiGs attacked the Bukoba area. Most of their bombs landed in [[Lake Victoria]] and nearby forests, though one landed 50 metres (164 ft) from the hospital, creating a large crater. Aside from some broken windows the raid caused little damage, but the population was frightened and by afternoon the roads leading out of the town were full of people evacuating via vehicle and foot.{{sfn|Avirgan|Honey|1983|p=59}} By the next morning Bukoba was almost completely deserted except for TPDF personnel.{{sfn|Avirgan|Honey|1983|pp=59\u201360}} The Tanzanian missile team moved to Kyaka, from where they successfully shot down a MiG.

Those equipped with vehicles, such as [[United Nations Development Programme]] personnel, drove to [[Mwanza]]. For the tens of thousands who could not move as far, the situation was deteriorating as conditions grew crowded and food and water became scarce. Some merchants began engaging in [[price gouging]]. Local officials attempted to alleviate the problem by bringing in food from government stockpiles. This became unfeasible as Singano commandeered most remaining vehicles to move his troops and artillery. The Tanzanian state-run news media did not report on the conflict, adding to the confusion of the civilians. Most of the Bukoba men resolved to return to their town to resume work while leaving their families in the countryside. Meanwhile, Singano petitioned his superiors in Tabora for reinforcements. They assured him that assistance was on its way, but no troops ever arrived. Over the next few days he busied himself with trying keep his artillery mobile.{{sfn|Avirgan|Honey|1983|p=60}}\n\nAt the same time, the Ugandans prepared a new attack. Amin ordered the [[Moroto Town|Moroto]]-based Gonda Battalion to aid the invasion, but its commander, Lieutenant Colonel Yefusa Bananuka, had only been appointed a few days before the war's outbreak.

The Ugandans met light resistance and in November President [[Idi Amin]] of Uganda announced the annexation of all Tanzanian land north of the [[Kagera River]]. The Tanzanians organised a [[counter-offensive]] later in November and successfully ejected the Ugandan forces from their country.\n\nRelations between Tanzania and Uganda had been tense since then-Colonel Amin overthrew Ugandan President [[Milton Obote]] in 1971. Tanzanian President [[Julius Nyerere]] supported Obote and backed an unsuccessful attempt by him to regain power in 1972. Uganda also disputed its border with Tanzania, claiming that the Kagera Salient\u2014a {{convert|1865|km2}} stretch of land between the official border and the Kagera River {{convert|29|km}} to the south\u2014should be ceded to Uganda. Tensions remained high through 1978, when Amin's regime started rapidly declining due to economic problems and dissent in the armed forces. In early October Ugandan forces began making small incursions into the Kagera region. On 25 October the [[Uganda Army (1971\u20131980)|Uganda Army]] launched a large attack over the border, but was repulsed by Tanzanian artillery. The Ugandans attacked again on 30 October, quickly overwhelming the small Tanzanian contingent in the region and completely occupying the Kagera Salient. Amin declared that Uganda was annexing the region, and shortly thereafter the Ugandans destroyed the only bridge over the Kagera River, easing their commanders' concerns about a Tanzanian counter-offensive. The Uganda Army pillaged the land, stealing cattle, automobiles, and personal belongings from homes. Approximately 1,500 civilians were shot and killed, and thousands more fled south.\n\nTanzania was caught unprepared for war but Nyerere\u2014after being assured by his commanders of his country's military capability to react\u2014ordered a [[mobilisation]] and instructed the [[Tanzania People's Defence Force]] (TPDF) to prepare a counter-offensive. Mozambique sent a [[battalion]] to Tanzania as a gesture of support. The [[Organisation of African Unity]] attempted to foster a diplomatic solution but Nyerere rejected attempts at mediation. Uganda Army officers concentrated on looting and ignored intelligence reports of Tanzanian plans, and thus were caught unprepared when the TPDF initiated Operation Chakaza. Most Ugandan soldiers fled in the face of artillery bombardment, and Amin soon thereafter declared that he was unconditionally withdrawing the Uganda Army from Kagera, a claim which was bitterly contested by Tanzania. Tanzanian troops used [[pontoon bridge|pontoons]] and a [[Bailey bridge]] to move heavy equipment across the river and probed the area. By January 1979 the TPDF had re-secured the Kagera Salient. Nyerere did not initially intend on expanding the war beyond expelling the Ugandans from Tanzanian territory. After Amin failed to renounce his claims to Kagera and the OAU failed to condemn the Ugandan invasion, Nyerere ordered the TPDF to attack Uganda, resulting in Amin's overthrow in April. Following the conclusion of the war, the Tanzanian government undertook efforts to rehabilitate Kagera, but social services and the standard of living for locals remained diminished for many years. The Uganda\u2013Tanzania War is remembered in Tanzania as the Kagera War.\n\n== Background ==\n[[File:Idi Amin cropped.jpg|thumb|left|[[Idi Amin]] (pictured) became the [[President of Uganda]] following [[1971 Ugandan coup d'\u00e9tat|a 1971 coup]].]]\n\nIn 1971 Colonel [[Idi Amin]] launched [[1971 Ugandan coup d'\u00e9tat|a military coup]] that overthrew the [[President of Uganda]], [[Milton Obote]], precipitating a deterioration of relations with neighbouring Tanzania.<ref name= honey2/> [[President of Tanzania|Tanzanian President]] [[Julius Nyerere]] had close ties with Obote and had supported his [[Socialism|socialist]] orientation.{{sfn|Roberts|2017|p=155}} Amin installed himself as President of Uganda and ruled the country under a repressive dictatorship.<ref name= honey2>{{cite news| last = Honey| first = Martha| title = Ugandan Capital Captured| newspaper = The Washington Post| date = 12 April 1979| url = https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/politics/1979/04/12/ugandan-capital-captured/1eb604a7-5ff0-4c51-9fa0-527169e5bffa/?noredirect=on|access-date=7 November 2018}}</ref> Nyerere withheld diplomatic recognition of the new government and offered asylum to Obote and his supporters.{{sfn|Roberts|2017|p=155}} Uganda twice launched military attacks against the Tanzanian border that year.{{sfn|Avirgan|Honey|1983|p=35}} With the approval of Nyerere, Ugandan exiles organised a small army of [[Guerrilla warfare|guerrillas]], and attempted, unsuccessfully, to invade Uganda and remove Amin in 1972.{{efn|Nyerere authorised the attack after hearing rumours of a plot by Uganda and [[Portuguese Mozambique]] to invade Tanzania and depose him.{{sfn|Avirgan|Honey|1983|p=35}}}} Amin blamed Nyerere for backing and arming his enemies,{{sfn|Cooper|Fontanellaz|2015|pp=6\u20137}} and retaliated by bombing Tanzanian border towns. Though his commanders urged him to respond in kind, Nyerere agreed to mediation overseen by the [[President of Somalia]], [[Siad Barre]], resulting in the signing of the [[Mogadishu Agreement]], which stipulated that Ugandan and Tanzanian forces had to withdraw to positions at least 10 kilometres away from the border and refrain from supporting opposition forces that targeted each other's governments. Nevertheless, relations between the two presidents remained tense; Nyerere frequently denounced Amin's regime, and Amin made repeated threats to invade Tanzania. During the same time, relations between Tanzania and [[Kenya]] grew sour, and the [[East African Community]] subsequently collapsed.{{sfn|Roberts|2017|p=155}} Uganda also disputed its border with Tanzania, claiming that the [[Kagera Region|Kagera]] Salient\u2014a {{convert|1865|km2}} stretch of land between the official border and the [[Kagera River]] 29 kilometres (18 miles) to the south\u2014should be ceded to Uganda, maintaining that the river made for a more logical border. The border had originally been negotiated by British and German colonial officials before [[World War I]].<ref name= darnton1/>\n\nMeanwhile, in Uganda, Amin announced an \"Economic War\" in which thousands of [[Expulsion of Asians from Uganda|Asian immigrants were expelled]] from the country and their businesses placed under the management of Africans. The reform had disastrous consequences for the economy, which were further exacerbated by a United States boycott of Ugandan coffee on account of the government's failure to respect [[human rights]].{{sfn|Roberts|2017|p=155}} At the same time, Amin expanded the power of the armed forces in his government, placing many soldiers in his cabinet and providing those loyal to him with [[patronage]]. Most of the beneficiaries of his actions were Muslim northerners, particularly those of [[Nubians|Nubian]] and Sudanese extract, who were increasingly recruited into the army.{{sfn|Roberts|2017|pp=155\u2013156}} Amin violently purged members of southern ethnic groups from the armed forces and executed political opponents.{{sfn|Roberts|2017|p=156}} In 1977 a split in the [[Uganda Army (1971\u20131980)|Uganda Army]] developed between supporters of Amin and soldiers loyal to the [[Vice President of Uganda]], [[Mustafa Adrisi]], who held significant power in the government and wanted to purge foreigners from the military. In April 1978 Adrisi was severely injured in a suspicious car accident. When he was flown out of the country for treatment, Amin stripped him of his ministerial portfolios. He also announced the arrest of multiple police officials, and during the following month he dismissed several ministers and military officers.{{sfn|Avirgan|Honey|1983|pp=49\u201350}} The shakeup strained Amin's narrow base of power in the military that had been declining in the face of the worsening economic situation, which eliminated patronage opportunities.{{sfn|Roberts|2017|p=156}} Fearing for his personal safety and less confident in his charismatic abilities to diffuse the growing tension, Amin began withdrawing from the public sphere and conducting less visits with his troops. At around the same time he began accusing Tanzania of violating Uganda's border.{{sfn|Avirgan|Honey|1983|p=51}} In May, Amin falsely claimed that Tanzanian troops had attacked the [[Rakai District]].{{sfn|Hooper|1999|p=42}} He also appealed to his allies, President [[Gaafar Nimeiry]] of Sudan and leader [[Muammar Gaddafi]] of [[History of Libya under Muammar Gaddafi|Libya]] to intervene and resolve the \"potentially explosive\" situation, claiming that Tanzanian forces were moving within 4.8 kilometres (three miles) of Ugandan border towns. In July, Radio Uganda erroneously declared that Obote was planning another Tanzanian-supported overthrow attempt. Nyerere ignored the allegations.{{sfn|Avirgan|Honey|1983|p=51}}\n\nIn reality, since May, Ugandan troops and military equipment had been shifted towards the border at Amin's direction and in violation of the Mogadishu Agreement.{{sfn|Cooper|Fontanellaz|2015|p=22}} Only one Tanzanian [[Company (military unit)|company]] was near the border region and Obote's irregular troops were in a refugee camp.{{sfn|Avirgan|Honey|1983|p=51}} In July, [[Brigadier]] Yusuf Himid of the [[Tanzania People's Defence Force]] (TPDF) warned Uganda to cease its \"repeated provocations\" against Tanzania.{{sfn|Avirgan|Honey|1983|pp=51\u201352}} As tensions with Tanzania increased, a number of Amin's high-ranking military commanders began to advocate war with the neighbouring state. They were opposed by other Ugandan generals who argued that Uganda Army was not ready for an open conflict. Though desiring to annex part of Tanzania for some time, President Amin initially sided with the more cautious commanders.<ref name= lubega/><ref name=\"lies\">{{cite web| url = http://www.monitor.co.ug/SpecialReports/ugandaat50/Lies-drove-Amin-to-strike-Tanzania/1370466-1628176-14f9t0qz/index.html | title = Lies drove Amin to strike Tanzania | date = 25 November 2012 | website = Daily Monitor| access-date = 14 October 2018}}</ref> In August Amin dispatched several agents to eliminate a battalion planning to mutiny in favour of Adrisi.

Among the incidents identified as possible start points for the war are cases of cattle rustling, tribal tensions, a fight between a Ugandan woman and a Tanzanian woman at a market,{{sfn|Rice|2003|p=11}} as well as a bar fight between a Ugandan soldier and Tanzanian soldiers or civilians.<ref>{{cite web| url = http://www.monitor.co.ug/Magazines/PeoplePower/Pilot-Omita-MiG21-AminTanzania-Juma-Butabika/689844-4129682-lwlpbkz/index.html | title = Pilot Omita parachutes out of burning MiG-21 | date = 9 October 2017| website = Daily Monitor | access-date = 14 October 2018}}</ref><ref name=barfight/> Several Ugandan soldiers who endorsed the bar fight theory disagreed on the confrontation's exact circumstances, but agreed that the incident occurred on 9 October in a Tanzanian establishment. They also agreed that after Butabika was informed of the altercation, he unilaterally ordered his unit, the Malire Battalion, to attack Tanzania in reprisal. The soldiers stated that Amin was not informed of this decision until later and went along with it to [[save face]].<ref name=barfight>{{cite web| url = https://www.monitor.co.ug/Magazines/PeoplePower/How-bar-fight-sparked-the-1979-Uganda--Tanzania-war/689844-3002788-12ob9gk/index.html| title = How bar fight sparked the 1979 Uganda - Tanzania war| last = Mugabe| first = Faustin| date = 20 December 2015| website = Daily Monitor| access-date = 13 August 2019}}</ref> One Ugandan commander, Bernard Rwehururu, stated that Butabika lied to Amin about his reasons for attacking Kagera, claiming that he was repulsing a Tanzanian invasion.{{sfn|Cooper|Fontanellaz|2015|p=24}} According to American journalists Tony Avirgan and Martha Honey, the bar incident occurred on 22 October, when a drunken Ugandan intelligence officer was shot and killed by Tanzanian soldiers after firing on them. That evening Radio Uganda declared that the Tanzanians had abducted a Ugandan soldier, and reported that Amin threatened to do \"something\" if he was not returned.{{sfn|Avirgan|Honey|1983|pp=57\u201358}}\n\nAnother theory describes the invasion as the result of Ugandan troops chasing mutineers over the Tanzanian border. There are several different variations of this account, which were mostly circulated by non-Ugandan sources.{{sfn|Mambo|Schofield|2007|p=312}} Ugandan diplomat [[Paul Eitang]] and the local managing director for [[Royal Dutch Shell]] reported that soldiers of the Simba Battalion had shot new Sudanese recruits and that when other Ugandan forces were sent to contain them, they fled over the border on 30 October.{{sfn|Roberts|2017|pp=156\u2013157}} ''[[The New York Times]]'' reporter [[John Darnton]] pieced together several refugee accounts which suggested that Amin had possibly planned an invasion of Tanzania to purge followers of Adrisi from the military. Accordingly, the invasion was intended as suicide mission, and any returning troops would be killed upon reentering Uganda.

Tanzania had tense relations with [[Zaire]], Kenya, and Malawi, and the only forces defending the land along the Ugandan border was the 202nd Brigade based in [[Tabora]]. It was led by an elderly commander, Brigadier Himid. Near the frontier was the understrength 3rd Battalion, led by Lieutenant Colonel Morris Singano. Its main responsibilities were to conduct reconnaissance and combat smuggling. In early September the Tanzanians reported unusually large numbers of Ugandan patrols near the border\u2014some equipped with [[armoured personnel carrier]]s\u2014and a high volume of air reconnaissance flights. By the middle of the month the Ugandan aircraft began crossing into Tanzanian airspace.{{sfn|Avirgan|Honey|1983|p=53}} Singano reported the unusual activity to the brigade headquarters in Tabora, and was assured that anti-aircraft guns would be sent to him.

A Tanzanian observation post witnessed the event and contacted Singano via radio, who subsequently ordered his artillery to open fire on Ugandan positions. A Ugandan armoured personnel carrier and truck were destroyed, and two soldiers were killed. Ugandan artillery returned fire but caused no damage.

Ugandan artillery continuously bombarded Tanzanian territory, so Singano requested that his 120&nbsp;mm mortars\u2014the largest calibre artillery he had\u2014be moved to the front line. They were brought into action four days later, and the Ugandan guns subsequently stopped firing. Over the next few days both sides exchanged artillery fire, gradually expanding across the whole border. Tanzanian leaders felt that Amin was only making provocations. Singano sent increasingly urgent requests for help, and was eventually told that reinforcements would be sent.{{sfn|Avirgan|Honey|1983|p=54}}\n\nOn 18 October Ugandan MiGs bombed [[Bukoba]], the capital of the [[Kagera Region|West Lake Region]]. Despite facing ineffectual Tanzanian anti-aircraft fire, the bombings caused little damage, but the explosions shattered windows caused panic.{{sfn|Avirgan|Honey|1983|p=54}} The following day West Lake Regional Commissioner Mohamed Kissoky hosted a meeting with government and [[Chama Cha Mapinduzi]] (CCM, the state political party) officials. He told them that the border conflict was the result of a misunderstanding and encouraged them to reiterate that \"we are great friends with Uganda, and Idi Amin has been at that border shaking hands with our people.\"{{sfn|Avirgan|Honey|1983|p=56}} Despite Kissoky's appeal for calm, Bukoba residents continued to panic, their anxieties worsened by exaggerated stories of battles from fleeing villagers from the north. Aside from Kissoky, Tanzanian leaders did not make any public comments about the conflict, and [[Radio Tanzania Dar es Salaam|Radio Tanzania]] did not report on it. In contrast, Radio Uganda reported a Tanzanian \"invasion\" of Ugandan territory with accounts of fictional battles, and detailed that Tanzanian troops had advanced 15 kilometres (9.3 miles) into Uganda, killing civilians and destroying property. Amin told residents in Mutukula that in spite of the \"attack\", he still hoped for good relations with Tanzania. At the same time, Radio Uganda's Kinyankole language broadcasts\u2014which were closely monitored and understood by West Lake residents\u2014severely criticised Nyerere and claimed that Tanzanians wished to fall under Ugandan jurisdiction to escape the former's rule.{{sfn|Avirgan|Honey|1983|p=56}} Meanwhile, the Ugandan regime came under increased internal strain.

Singano received radio reports on the situation at his headquarters in [[Kyaka]], {{convert|32|km}} south of the border and just south of the Kagera River. Several minutes later three other observation posts reported Ugandan manoeuvres on the other side of the border. Singano went to a hill near Kyaka from where he witnessed Ugandan artillery open fire. Fifteen minutes later he received a radio message from an understrength [[platoon]] of 20 TPDF soldiers opposite Mutukula, who reported that they were under attack and exchanging heavy fire with the Uganda Army. All other Tanzanian soldiers broke under fire and fled towards the Kagera River. Realising that an invasion was underway, Singano ordered the platoon near Mutukula to retreat to Kyaka.{{sfn|Avirgan|Honey|1983|p=58}} Over 2,000 Ugandan soldiers under the command of Lieutenant Colonel Marajani,{{sfn|Avirgan|Honey|1983|pp=58\u201359}}{{efn|Journalist James Tumusiime transliterates this name as \"Marjan\".{{sfn|Tumusiime|1992|p=14}} Lieutenant Colonel Hussein Marijan was known to have served as Simba Battalion commander along the Uganda-Tanzania border in 1977.{{sfn|Omara-Otunnu|1987|pp=139\u2013140}} }} Butabika, and Kisuule attacked Kagera.

Marajani reported heavy resistance despite the fact that all TPDF personnel had withdrawn from the border area. Believing that his enemies were confused about the situation, at mid-morning Singano ordered an artillery unit to the front to put up resistance. It was equipped with 122{{nbs}}mm (4.8{{nbs}}in) mortars, a 120{{nbs}}mm (4.7{{nbs}}in) [[howitzer]], and a few 85{{nbs}}mm (3.3{{nbs}}in) guns.{{sfn|Avirgan|Honey|1983|pp=58\u201359}} Stationed in the area around Bumazi,{{sfn|Cooper|Fontanellaz|2015|p=24}} the unit set up its artillery {{convert|10|km}} from the Ugandans and fired several shells, causing them to retreat across the border.{{efn|According to Ugandan sources, the first attack on Kagera was repelled after one day had passed.{{sfn|Cooper|Fontanellaz|2015|p=24}} }} Throughout the rest of the day Ugandan MiGs crossed into Tanzanian airspace, where they were harassed by inconsequential anti-aircraft fire.

Realising the veracity of Singano's warnings in light of the action, Tanzanian commanders dispatched a six-strong anti-aircraft team equipped with [[9K32 Strela-2|SA-7]] shoulder-fired [[heat-seeking missile]]s from Tabora to the front.{{sfn|Cooper|Fontanellaz|2015|p=25}}{{sfn|Avirgan|Honey|1983|pp=59\u201360}} The unit arrived in Bukoba on 27 October. Shortly before its arrival, three MiGs attacked the Bukoba area. Most of their bombs landed in [[Lake Victoria]] and nearby forests, though one landed 50 metres (164 ft) from the hospital, creating a large crater. Aside from some broken windows the raid caused little damage, but the population was frightened and by afternoon the roads leading out of the town were full of people evacuating via vehicle and foot.{{sfn|Avirgan|Honey|1983|p=59}} By the next morning Bukoba was almost completely deserted except for TPDF personnel.{{sfn|Avirgan|Honey|1983|pp=59\u201360}} The Tanzanian missile team moved to Kyaka, from where they successfully shot down a MiG.

Those equipped with vehicles, such as [[United Nations Development Programme]] personnel, drove to [[Mwanza]]. For the tens of thousands who could not move as far, the situation was deteriorating as conditions grew crowded and food and water became scarce. Some merchants began engaging in [[price gouging]]. Local officials attempted to alleviate the problem by bringing in food from government stockpiles. This became unfeasible as Singano commandeered most remaining vehicles to move his troops and artillery. The Tanzanian state-run news media did not report on the conflict, adding to the confusion of the civilians. Most of the Bukoba men resolved to return to their town to resume work while leaving their families in the countryside. Meanwhile, Singano petitioned his superiors in Tabora for reinforcements. They assured him that assistance was on its way, but no troops ever arrived. Over the next few days he busied himself with trying keep his artillery mobile.{{sfn|Avirgan|Honey|1983|p=60}}\n\nAt the same time, the Ugandans prepared a new attack. Amin ordered the [[Moroto Town|Moroto]]-based Gonda Battalion to aid the invasion, but its commander, Lieutenant Colonel Yefusa Bananuka, had only been appointed a few days before the war's outbreak.

It is a moderately common resident of the coolest parts of south-eastern Australia, including [[Tasmania]]. Like the other two red-breasted ''Petroica'' robins&mdash;the [[scarlet robin]] and the [[red-capped robin]]&mdash;it is often simply called the ''robin redbreast''. Like many brightly coloured robins of the [[Petroicidae]], it is [[Sexual dimorphism|sexually dimorphic]]. Measuring {{convert|12|\u2013|14|cm|in|abbr=on}} long, the flame robin has dark brown eyes and a small thin black bill. The male has a brilliant orange-red chest and throat, and a white patch on the forehead above the bill. Its upper parts are iron-grey with white bars, and its tail black with white tips. The female is a nondescript grey-brown. Its song has been described as the most musical of its genus.\n\nThe position of the flame robin and its Australian relatives on the passerine family tree is unclear; the Petroicidae are not closely related to either the [[European robin|European]] or [[American robin]]s, but appear to be an early offshoot of the [[Passerida]] group of [[songbird]]s. The flame robin is predominantly [[insectivore|insectivorous]], pouncing on prey from a perch in a tree, or foraging on the ground. A [[territory (animal)|territorial]] bird, the flame robin employs song and plumage displays to mark out and defend its territory. Classified by [[BirdLife International]] as ''[[Near Threatened]]'', the species has suffered a marked decline in the past 25 years.\n\n==Taxonomy==\nThe flame robin was first [[Species description|described]] by the French [[natural history|naturalist]]s, [[Jean Ren\u00e9 Constant Quoy]] and [[Joseph Paul Gaimard]], in 1830 as ''Muscicapa chrysoptera''.<ref>Quoy, Jean Ren\u00e9 Constant; Gaimard, Joseph Paul in Dumont-d'Urville, J.

It is a moderately common resident of the coolest parts of south-eastern Australia, including [[Tasmania]]. Like the other two red-breasted ''Petroica'' robins&mdash;the [[scarlet robin]] and the [[red-capped robin]]&mdash;it is often simply called the ''robin redbreast''. Like many brightly coloured robins of the [[Petroicidae]], it is [[Sexual dimorphism|sexually dimorphic]]. Measuring {{convert|12|\u2013|14|cm|in|abbr=on}} long, the flame robin has dark brown eyes and a small thin black bill. The male has a brilliant orange-red chest and throat, and a white patch on the forehead above the bill. Its upper parts are iron-grey with white bars, and its tail black with white tips. The female is a nondescript grey-brown. Its song has been described as the most musical of its genus.\n\nThe position of the flame robin and its Australian relatives on the passerine family tree is unclear; the Petroicidae are not closely related to either the [[European robin|European]] or [[American robin]]s, but appear to be an early offshoot of the [[Passerida]] group of [[songbird]]s. The flame robin is predominantly [[insectivore|insectivorous]], pouncing on prey from a perch in a tree, or foraging on the ground. A [[territory (animal)|territorial]] bird, the flame robin employs song and plumage displays to mark out and defend its territory. Classified by [[BirdLife International]] as ''[[Near Threatened]]'', the species has suffered a marked decline in the past 25 years.\n\n==Taxonomy==\nThe flame robin was first [[Species description|described]] by the French [[natural history|naturalist]]s, [[Jean Ren\u00e9 Constant Quoy]] and [[Joseph Paul Gaimard]], in 1830 as ''Muscicapa chrysoptera''.<ref>Quoy, Jean Ren\u00e9 Constant; Gaimard, Joseph Paul in Dumont-d'Urville, J.

Weinstein and [[Bill Oakley]] became best friends and writing partners at [[St. Albans School (Washington, D.C.)|St. Albans School]]; Weinstein then attended [[Stanford University]] and was [[editor-in-chief]] of the ''[[Stanford Chaparral]]''. He worked on several short-term media projects, including writing for the variety show ''Sunday Best'', but was then unemployed for a long period.\n\nWeinstein and Oakley eventually penned a [[spec script]] for ''[[Seinfeld]]'', after which they wrote \"[[Marge Gets a Job]]\", an episode of ''The Simpsons''. Subsequently, the two were hired to write for the show on a permanent basis in 1992. After they wrote episodes such as \"[[$pringfield (Or, How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love Legalized Gambling)]]\", \"[[Bart vs. Australia]]\" and \"[[Who Shot Mr. Burns?]]\", the two were appointed [[executive producer]]s and [[showrunner]]s for the [[The Simpsons (season 7)|seventh]] and [[The Simpsons (season 8)|eighth]] seasons of the show. They attempted to include several emotional episodes focusing on the [[Simpson family]], as well as several high-concept episodes such as \"[[Homer's Enemy]]\", \"[[Two Bad Neighbors]]\" and \"[[The Principal and the Pauper]]\", winning three [[Primetime Emmy Awards]] for their work.\n\nAfter they left ''The Simpsons'', Oakley and Weinstein created ''[[Mission Hill (TV series)|Mission Hill]]''. The show was plagued by promotional issues and was swiftly canceled, but in subsequent years has gone on to develop a cult following. They worked as [[consultants|consulting producers]] on ''[[Futurama]]'', then created ''[[The Mullets (TV series)|The Mullets]]'' in 2003. The two wrote several unsuccessful TV pilots, and were due to serve as showrunners on ''[[Sit Down, Shut Up (2009 TV series)|Sit Down, Shut Up]]'' in 2009. Oakley left the project over a contract dispute, but Weinstein remained until it was canceled. He co-produced and wrote for ''Futurama'' again during its [[Comedy Central]] revival, winning an Emmy in 2011. Since 2013, Weinstein has served as showrunner for the [[CBBC]] series ''[[Strange Hill High]]'', and in 2015, ''[[Danger Mouse (2015 TV series)|Danger Mouse]]''. He has also served as a writer for season two of ''[[Gravity Falls]]'', co-writing nine of the season's episodes. In 2018, Weinstein co-developed the Netflix animated series ''[[Disenchantment (TV series)|Disenchantment]]'' with creator [[Matt Groening]], of which he and Oakley are currently serving as co-showrunners. Weinstein is married to journalist Lisa Simmons.\n\n==Early life==\nWeinstein was born and raised in [[Washington, D.C.]]<ref name=phobia/> to Rosa and Harris Weinstein.

They were chosen partly because they had been with the show since the third season and understood many of its dynamics.<ref name=simp/> The showrunner is responsible for overseeing all aspects of the show's production. Each episode takes ten months to produce, so the showrunner must \"oversee many different episodes in different stages of production all at the same time\", with roles including head writer, making notes on the [[storyboard]]s and working with the voice actors, animators, editors and composers. Oakley and Weinstein often set two script-rewriting rooms in motion at the same time, delegating leadership in the rooms to writers such as [[Steve Tompkins]] and [[David X. Cohen|David Cohen]].<ref name=\"NoHomers\"/> Mirkin, who had suggested that the two take over, remained on the show in an advisory capacity, helping Oakley and Weinstein with technical aspects of the show such as editing and sound mixing.<ref name=\"NoHomers\"/> When they took over the series, they wanted many of the episodes to be realistic ones that focused more on the five members of the [[Simpson family]] and explored their feelings and emotions towards each other.<ref>{{cite video | people=Oakley, Bill|date=2005|title=The Simpsons The Complete Seventh Season DVD commentary for the episode \"Home Sweet Homediddly-Dum-Doodily\"| medium=DVD|publisher=20th Century Fox}}</ref> They wanted to produce ''[[Treehouse of Horror (series)|Treehouse of Horror]]'' episodes, episodes about [[Sideshow Bob]], [[The Itchy & Scratchy Show|Itchy & Scratchy]] and several \"format-bending\" episodes such as \"[[22 Short Films About Springfield]]\", for which Weinstein wrote the scene featuring [[Comic Book Guy]] and [[Milhouse Van Houten]].<ref>{{cite video | people=Weinstein, Josh|date=2006|title=The Simpsons The Complete Seventh Season DVD commentary for the episode \"22 Short Films About Springfield\"| medium=DVD|publisher=20th Century Fox}}</ref> They aimed for \"at least two episodes per season that 'pushed the envelope', [and] expanded the definition of what an episode could be\".<ref name=\"NoHomers\"/> This was a style they employed for both seasons they produced.<ref name=\"nohomers2\" /> Season eight featured several episodes in which focus was given to secondary characters and in which new issues were explored, such as divorce.<ref name=nohomers2>{{cite web |url=http://www.nohomers.net/showthread.php?t=53574 |title=Ask Bill and Josh 2 Q&A Thread |accessdate=2010-07-26|publisher=NoHomers.net |date=2006-01-08 }}</ref> Their preferred choice of guest stars were those with unique and interesting voices, and several of their guest stars were \"old grizzled men with distinctive voices\" such as [[R.

That was what we consciously used as our model. Dimwitted, loving, hyper-enthusiastic, creatively goofy, parody of the American father&nbsp;\u2013 drawn with real emotions, though admittedly amplified. This was exemplified in \"[[Mother Simpson]]\", \"[[Lisa the Iconoclast]]\", \"[[Home Sweet Homediddly-Dum-Doodily|Diddly-Dum-Doodly]]\", and a couple others. In some of the less reality-based episodes, i.e. [[Homer vs. the Eighteenth Amendment|the Beer Baron one]]&nbsp;\u2013 usually [[John Swartzwelder|Swartzwelder]]'s, we'd treat this stricture with a certain amount of latitude.\"<ref name=duff/>\n\nOne of their most notable episodes was \"[[Homer's Enemy]]\", an episode designed to \"push the envelope conceptually\". The idea for \"Homer's Enemy\" was first conceived by Oakley who thought that Homer should have an enemy. This evolved into the concept of a \"real world\" co-worker who would either love or hate Homer. The writers chose the latter as they thought it would have funnier results.<ref name=\"Weinstein\"/> The result was the character of Frank Grimes, a man who has had to work hard all his life with nothing to show for it and is dismayed and embittered by Homer's success and comfort in spite of his inherent laziness and ignorance.<ref name=\"Weinstein\"/> \"Homer's Enemy\" explores the comic possibilities of a realistic character with a strong [[work ethic]] placed alongside Homer in a work environment. In the episode, Homer is portrayed as an everyman and the embodiment of the American spirit; however, in some scenes his negative characteristics and silliness are prominently highlighted.<ref name=\"Weinstein\">{{cite video | people=Weinstein, Josh|date=2006|title=The Simpsons The Complete Eighth Season DVD commentary for the episode \"Homer's Enemy\"| medium=DVD|publisher=20th Century Fox}}</ref>{{sfn|Turner|2004|pp=99\u2013106}} By the close of the episode, Grimes, a hard working and persevering \"real American hero,\"{{sfn|Turner|2004|pp=99\u2013106}} is relegated to the role of antagonist; the viewer is intended to be pleased that Homer has emerged victorious.{{sfn|Turner|2004|pp=99\u2013106}} Oakley says the episode was \"hyper-[[meta]]\" and focused on \"parodying to some degree the Homer we don't like.

Although, I would argue that in \"Homer's Enemy\" he's not even really even all that excessively stupid or immature, actually.\"<ref name=duff/> Weinstein said: \"We wanted to do an episode where the thinking was \"What if a real life, normal person had to enter Homer's universe and deal with him?\" I know this episode is controversial and divisive, but I just love it.

W. Bush]], a reference to the show's feud with the Bushes in the early 1990s.<ref>Brooks, James L. (2004). \"Bush vs. Simpsons\", in ''The Simpsons: The Complete Fourth Season'' [DVD]. 20th Century Fox.</ref> Weinstein said that the episode is often misunderstood.

Oakley described the episode as a companion piece to \"Homer's Enemy\", in that a character is juxtaposed alongside Homer and does not get along with him.<ref>{{cite video | people=Oakley, Bill|date=2005|title=The Simpsons The Complete Seventh Season DVD commentary for the episode \"Two Bad Neighbors\"| medium=DVD|publisher=20th Century Fox}}</ref>\n\nThey considered working on the show to be similar to working in a bubble due to the lack of interference from the Fox network's executives, as is commonplace on other shows.<ref name=simp/> This allowed them to produce any episodes they wanted, as Weinstein commented: \"The great thing about ''The Simpsons'' is that we pretty much were able to get away with everything, so there weren't any episodes we really wanted to do that we couldn't do. Even the crazy high-concept ones like \"Two Bad Neighbors\" and \"Homer's Enemy\" we managed to put on the air because honestly there were no network execs there to stop us.\"<ref name=\"NoHomers\"/> Such was the network's limited input, when an executive suggested the staff introduce a new character to live with the Simpsons so as to \"liven up the show\",<ref>{{cite video | people=Groening, Matt|date=2006|title=The Simpsons The Complete Eighth Season DVD commentary for the episode \"The Itchy & Scratchy & Poochie Show\"| medium=DVD|publisher=20th Century Fox}}</ref> the staff rejected the idea and instead created the episode \"[[The Itchy & Scratchy & Poochie Show]]\", inserting the one-time character Roy, with no explanation as to who he was, or why he was living with the family, as a reference to the executive's proposal.<ref name=Smithcom>{{cite video | people=Smith, Yeardley|date=2006|title=The Simpsons The Complete Eighth Season DVD commentary for the episode \"The Itchy & Scratchy & Poochie Show\"| medium=DVD|publisher=20th Century Fox}}</ref> The episode, which marked the point at which ''The Simpsons'' surpassed ''[[The Flintstones]]'' for the number of episodes produced for an [[animated series]],<ref>{{cite magazine|url=http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,290859,00.html|title=1997 Timeline|accessdate=2007-03-13|magazine=[[Entertainment Weekly]]|first=Marlene|last=McCampbell|date=1997-12-26}}</ref> was named by the [[BBC]] as one of the ten most memorable episodes of the show.

The episode \"[[Homer's Phobia]]\" drew the censor's objections. Its script came back with two pages of notes about almost every single line. The censors stated that they did not like the use of the word \"[[gay]]\", or the discussion of homosexuality at all, and closed with a paragraph which stated that \"the topic and substance of this episode are unacceptable for [[Broadcasting|broadcast]]\". The censor problems ultimately came to nothing when the episode came back from animation in South Korea, the then-Fox president had just been fired and replaced, with the censors being replaced as well. The new censors sent back merely one line: \"acceptable for broadcast\".<ref name=phobia>{{cite video | people=Oakley, Bill; Weinstein, Josh|date=2006|title=The Simpsons The Complete Eighth Season DVD commentary for the episode \"Homer's Phobia\"| medium=DVD|publisher=20th Century Fox}}</ref>\n\n====Leaving the show====\nOakley and Weinstein stood down as showrunners after season eight because they \"didn't want to break [the show]\". Oakley said: \"We always said we'd never do a joke that we'd done before.\"<ref name=mh/> They felt the showrunner should not stay for more than two seasons.<ref name=simp/> Due to the pressures of having to work on two seasons at once (writing season eight, whilst doing post-production of season seven), Oakley said that at least two episodes from season eight would ideally have been rewritten, had there been sufficient time,<ref name=nohomers2/> and that towards the end, they were \"treading water\".<ref name=port/> As they were working on [[post-production]] of season eight, they were credited as consulting producers for [[The Simpsons|season nine]], which was in its initial writing stages.<ref name=\"NoHomers\"/> Oakley stated that they contributed \"somewhere between 0 and .0001%\" of the season, only attending the table readings of the scripts.<ref name=\"NoHomers\"/> They produced three episodes held over from season eight, which aired as part of season nine: \"[[The City of New York vs. Homer Simpson]]\",<ref>{{cite video|people=Oakley, Bill|date=2006|title=The Simpsons The Complete Ninth Season DVD commentary for the episode \"The City of New York vs. Homer Simpson\"|medium=DVD|publisher=20th Century Fox}}</ref> \"[[The Principal and the Pauper]]\" and \"[[Lisa the Simpson]]\". \"The Principal and the Pauper\" was negatively received due the sudden revelation that long-time character [[Seymour Skinner]] was actually an imposter. For example, in his book ''[[Planet Simpson]]'', [[Chris Turner (author)|Chris Turner]] describes \"The Principal and the Pauper\" as the \"broadcast that marked [the] abrupt plunge\" from ''The Simpsons''<nowiki>'</nowiki> \"Golden Age\", which he says began in the middle of the show's [[The Simpsons (season 3)|third season]]. He calls the episode \"[one of] the weakest episodes in ''Simpsons'' history\".{{sfn|Turner|2004|pp=41\u201342}} As such, they consider it the most controversial episode from their tenure as executive producers. He and Oakley advise viewers to treat \"The Principal and the Pauper\" as an \"experiment\". They surmise that the negative reception was partly due to the fact that it was not immediately apparent to viewers that this was such an episode (as opposed to, for example, \"[[The Simpsons Spin-Off Showcase]]\"). They describe the ending of the episode as an attempt to reset the continuity and allow fans to consider the episode on its own.<ref>Oakley, Bill; Weinstein, Josh. (2006).

Six major publications panned it before they even saw it.\" The pilot garnered largely negative reviews from publications such as ''[[The Deseret News]]''; and earned a positive write-up in ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]''.<ref name=mh/> Furthermore, the show was forced to change from its originally planned title of ''The Downtowners'' due to its closeness to an [[MTV]] show.<ref name=mh/> All of these factors combined to ensure the show received little attention, and the WB ran only a few commercials for it. Weinstein stated: \"I don't know exactly why America doesn't know about this show.

Weinstein and [[Bill Oakley]] became best friends and writing partners at [[St. Albans School (Washington, D.C.)|St. Albans School]]; Weinstein then attended [[Stanford University]] and was [[editor-in-chief]] of the ''[[Stanford Chaparral]]''. He worked on several short-term media projects, including writing for the variety show ''Sunday Best'', but was then unemployed for a long period.\n\nWeinstein and Oakley eventually penned a [[spec script]] for ''[[Seinfeld]]'', after which they wrote \"[[Marge Gets a Job]]\", an episode of ''The Simpsons''. Subsequently, the two were hired to write for the show on a permanent basis in 1992. After they wrote episodes such as \"[[$pringfield (Or, How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love Legalized Gambling)]]\", \"[[Bart vs. Australia]]\" and \"[[Who Shot Mr. Burns?]]\", the two were appointed [[executive producer]]s and [[showrunner]]s for the [[The Simpsons (season 7)|seventh]] and [[The Simpsons (season 8)|eighth]] seasons of the show. They attempted to include several emotional episodes focusing on the [[Simpson family]], as well as several high-concept episodes such as \"[[Homer's Enemy]]\", \"[[Two Bad Neighbors]]\" and \"[[The Principal and the Pauper]]\", winning three [[Primetime Emmy Awards]] for their work.\n\nAfter they left ''The Simpsons'', Oakley and Weinstein created ''[[Mission Hill (TV series)|Mission Hill]]''. The show was plagued by promotional issues and was swiftly canceled, but in subsequent years has gone on to develop a cult following. They worked as [[consultants|consulting producers]] on ''[[Futurama]]'', then created ''[[The Mullets (TV series)|The Mullets]]'' in 2003. The two wrote several unsuccessful TV pilots, and were due to serve as showrunners on ''[[Sit Down, Shut Up (2009 TV series)|Sit Down, Shut Up]]'' in 2009. Oakley left the project over a contract dispute, but Weinstein remained until it was canceled. He co-produced and wrote for ''Futurama'' again during its [[Comedy Central]] revival, winning an Emmy in 2011. Since 2013, Weinstein has served as showrunner for the [[CBBC]] series ''[[Strange Hill High]]'', and in 2015, ''[[Danger Mouse (2015 TV series)|Danger Mouse]]''. He has also served as a writer for Season Two of ''[[Gravity Falls]]'', co-writing nine of the season's episodes. In 2018, Weinstein co-developed the Netflix animated series ''[[Disenchantment (TV series)|Disenchantment]]'' with creator [[Matt Groening]], of which he and Oakley are currently serving as co-showrunners. Weinstein is married to journalist Lisa Simmons.\n\n==Early life==\nWeinstein was born and raised in [[Washington, D.C.]]<ref name=phobia/> to Rosa and Harris Weinstein.

They were chosen partly because they had been with the show since the third season and understood many of its dynamics.<ref name=simp/> The showrunner is responsible for overseeing all aspects of the show's production. Each episode takes ten months to produce, so the showrunner must \"oversee many different episodes in different stages of production all at the same time\", with roles including head writer, making notes on the [[storyboard]]s and working with the voice actors, animators, editors and composers. Oakley and Weinstein often set two script-rewriting rooms in motion at the same time, delegating leadership in the rooms to writers such as [[Steve Tompkins]] and [[David X. Cohen|David Cohen]].<ref name=\"NoHomers\"/> Mirkin, who had suggested that the two take over, remained on the show in an advisory capacity, helping Oakley and Weinstein with technical aspects of the show such as editing and sound mixing.<ref name=\"NoHomers\"/> When they took over the series, they wanted many of the episodes to be realistic ones that focused more on the five members of the [[Simpson family]] and explored their feelings and emotions towards each other.<ref>{{cite video | people=Oakley, Bill|date=2005|title=The Simpsons The Complete Seventh Season DVD commentary for the episode \"Home Sweet Homediddly-Dum-Doodily\"| medium=DVD|publisher=20th Century Fox}}</ref> They wanted to produce ''[[Treehouse of Horror (series)|Treehouse of Horror]]'' episodes, episodes about [[Sideshow Bob]], [[The Itchy & Scratchy Show|Itchy & Scratchy]] and several \"format-bending\" episodes such as \"[[22 Short Films About Springfield]]\", for which Weinstein wrote the scene featuring [[Comic Book Guy]] and [[Milhouse Van Houten]].<ref>{{cite video | people=Weinstein, Josh|date=2006|title=The Simpsons The Complete Seventh Season DVD commentary for the episode \"22 Short Films About Springfield\"| medium=DVD|publisher=20th Century Fox}}</ref> They aimed for \"at least two episodes per season that 'pushed the envelope', [and] expanded the definition of what an episode could be\".<ref name=\"NoHomers\"/> This was a style they employed for both seasons they produced.<ref name=\"nohomers2\" /> Season eight featured several episodes in which focus was given to secondary characters and in which new issues were explored, such as divorce.<ref name=nohomers2>{{cite web |url=http://www.nohomers.net/showthread.php?t=53574 |title=Ask Bill and Josh 2 Q&A Thread |accessdate=2010-07-26|publisher=NoHomers.net |date=2006-01-08 }}</ref> Their preferred choice of guest stars were those with unique and interesting voices, and several of their guest stars were \"old grizzled men with distinctive voices\" such as [[R.

That was what we consciously used as our model. Dimwitted, loving, hyper-enthusiastic, creatively goofy, parody of the American father&nbsp;\u2013 drawn with real emotions, though admittedly amplified. This was exemplified in \"[[Mother Simpson]]\", \"[[Lisa the Iconoclast]]\", \"[[Home Sweet Homediddly-Dum-Doodily|Diddly-Dum-Doodly]]\", and a couple others. In some of the less reality-based episodes, i.e. [[Homer vs. the Eighteenth Amendment|the Beer Baron one]]&nbsp;\u2013 usually [[John Swartzwelder|Swartzwelder]]'s, we'd treat this stricture with a certain amount of latitude.\"<ref name=duff/>\n\nOne of their most notable episodes was \"[[Homer's Enemy]]\", an episode designed to \"push the envelope conceptually\". The idea for \"Homer's Enemy\" was first conceived by Oakley who thought that Homer should have an enemy. This evolved into the concept of a \"real world\" co-worker who would either love or hate Homer. The writers chose the latter as they thought it would have funnier results.<ref name=\"Weinstein\"/> The result was the character of Frank Grimes, a man who has had to work hard all his life with nothing to show for it and is dismayed and embittered by Homer's success and comfort in spite of his inherent laziness and ignorance.<ref name=\"Weinstein\"/> \"Homer's Enemy\" explores the comic possibilities of a realistic character with a strong [[work ethic]] placed alongside Homer in a work environment. In the episode, Homer is portrayed as an everyman and the embodiment of the American spirit; however, in some scenes his negative characteristics and silliness are prominently highlighted.<ref name=\"Weinstein\">{{cite video | people=Weinstein, Josh|date=2006|title=The Simpsons The Complete Eighth Season DVD commentary for the episode \"Homer's Enemy\"| medium=DVD|publisher=20th Century Fox}}</ref>{{sfn|Turner|2004|pp=99\u2013106}} By the close of the episode, Grimes, a hard working and persevering \"real American hero,\"{{sfn|Turner|2004|pp=99\u2013106}} is relegated to the role of antagonist; the viewer is intended to be pleased that Homer has emerged victorious.{{sfn|Turner|2004|pp=99\u2013106}} Oakley says the episode was \"hyper-[[meta]]\" and focused on \"parodying to some degree the Homer we don't like. That's one of the things that episode is supposed to illustrate&nbsp;\u2014 \"Homer gone wrong\". Although, I would argue that in \"Homer's Enemy\" he's not even really even all that excessively stupid or immature, actually.\"<ref name=duff/> Weinstein said: \"We wanted to do an episode where the thinking was \"What if a real life, normal person had to enter Homer's universe and deal with him?\" I know this episode is controversial and divisive, but I just love it. It really feels like what would happen if a real, somewhat humorless human had to deal with Homer. There was some talk [on NoHomers.net] about the ending\u2014we just did that because (a) it's really funny and shocking, (2) we like the lesson of \"sometimes, you just can't win\"\u2014the whole Frank Grimes episode is a study in frustration and hence Homer has the last laugh and (3) we wanted to show that in real life, being Homer Simpson could be really dangerous and life-threatening, as Frank Grimes sadly learned.\"<ref name=\"NoHomers\">{{cite web|url=http://www.nohomers.net/showthread.php?t=51876&page=2|title=Ask Bill & Josh|publisher=NoHomers.net|date=2005-11-02|accessdate=2010-07-31}}</ref> When the episode was first broadcast, many fans felt it was too dark, unfunny and that Homer was portrayed as overly bad-mannered.<ref name=\"Reardon\">{{cite video | people=Reardon, Jim|date=2006|title=The Simpsons The Complete Eighth Season DVD commentary for the episode \"Homer's Enemy\"| medium=DVD|publisher=20th Century Fox}}</ref> On the DVD commentary, Weinstein considers this episode one of the most controversial of the seasons he ran, as it involves sharp observational humor which many fans \"didn't get\".<ref name=\"Weinstein\"/> Weinstein also talks about a \"generation gap\"\u2014the episode was originally panned by viewers, but has since become a favorite among fans who grew up with the show.<ref name=\"Weinstein\"/>\n\nOther episodes included \"[[Two Bad Neighbors]]\", which sees Homer meet former President [[George H. W. Bush]], a reference to the show's feud with the Bushes in the early 1990s.<ref>Brooks, James L. (2004). \"Bush vs. Simpsons\", in ''The Simpsons: The Complete Fourth Season'' [DVD]. 20th Century Fox.</ref> Weinstein said that the episode is often misunderstood. Many audiences expected a political satire, while the writers made special effort to keep the parody apolitical.<ref>{{cite video | people=Weinstein, Josh|date=2005|title=The Simpsons The Complete Seventh Season DVD commentary for the episode \"Two Bad Neighbors\"| medium=DVD|publisher=20th Century Fox}}</ref> Oakley stresses that \"it's not a political attack, it's a personal attack!\", and instead of criticizing Bush for his policies, the episode instead pokes fun at his \"crotchetiness\". Oakley described the episode as a companion piece to \"Homer's Enemy\", in that a character is juxtaposed alongside Homer and does not get along with him.<ref>{{cite video | people=Oakley, Bill|date=2005|title=The Simpsons The Complete Seventh Season DVD commentary for the episode \"Two Bad Neighbors\"| medium=DVD|publisher=20th Century Fox}}</ref>\n\nThey considered working on the show to be similar to working in a bubble due to the lack of interference from the Fox network's executives, as is commonplace on other shows.<ref name=simp/> This allowed them to produce any episodes they wanted, as Weinstein commented: \"The great thing about ''The Simpsons'' is that we pretty much were able to get away with everything, so there weren't any episodes we really wanted to do that we couldn't do. Even the crazy high-concept ones like \"Two Bad Neighbors\" and \"Homer's Enemy\" we managed to put on the air because honestly there were no network execs there to stop us.\"<ref name=\"NoHomers\"/> Such was the network's limited input, when an executive suggested the staff introduce a new character to live with the Simpsons so as to \"liven up the show\",<ref>{{cite video | people=Groening, Matt|date=2006|title=The Simpsons The Complete Eighth Season DVD commentary for the episode \"The Itchy & Scratchy & Poochie Show\"| medium=DVD|publisher=20th Century Fox}}</ref> the staff rejected the idea and instead created the episode \"[[The Itchy & Scratchy & Poochie Show]]\", inserting the one-time character Roy, with no explanation as to who he was, or why he was living with the family, as a reference to the executive's proposal.<ref name=Smithcom>{{cite video | people=Smith, Yeardley|date=2006|title=The Simpsons The Complete Eighth Season DVD commentary for the episode \"The Itchy & Scratchy & Poochie Show\"| medium=DVD|publisher=20th Century Fox}}</ref> The episode, which marked the point at which ''The Simpsons'' surpassed ''[[The Flintstones]]'' for the number of episodes produced for an [[animated series]],<ref>{{cite magazine|url=http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,290859,00.html|title=1997 Timeline|accessdate=2007-03-13|magazine=[[Entertainment Weekly]]|first=Marlene|last=McCampbell|date=1997-12-26}}</ref> was named by the [[BBC]] as one of the ten most memorable episodes of the show. They noted \"the writers used the opportunity to pay tribute to the art of animation and rail against network interference in their show.\"<ref>{{cite news | title= The Simpsons: 10 classic episodes | url= http://news.bbc.co.uk/go/pr/fr/-/2/hi/entertainment/8449416.stm | work=[[BBC News]] | date= 2010-01-14 | accessdate=2010-01-15}}</ref> The intrusion of the network [[censors]] was limited: the normal procedure is for an episode's script to be sent to the censor and then faxed back with a list of lines and words that should be substituted, causing limited problems as often the offending lines are removed or changed for comedic purposes after animation. The episode \"[[Homer's Phobia]]\" drew the censor's objections. Its script came back with two pages of notes about almost every single line. The censors stated that they did not like the use of the word \"[[gay]]\", or the discussion of homosexuality at all, and closed with a paragraph which stated that \"the topic and substance of this episode are unacceptable for [[Broadcasting|broadcast]]\". The censor problems ultimately came to nothing when the episode came back from animation in South Korea, the then-Fox president had just been fired and replaced, with the censors being replaced as well. The new censors sent back merely one line: \"acceptable for broadcast\".<ref name=phobia>{{cite video | people=Oakley, Bill; Weinstein, Josh|date=2006|title=The Simpsons The Complete Eighth Season DVD commentary for the episode \"Homer's Phobia\"| medium=DVD|publisher=20th Century Fox}}</ref>\n\n====Leaving the show====\nOakley and Weinstein stood down as showrunners after season eight because they \"didn't want to break [the show]\". Oakley said: \"We always said we'd never do a joke that we'd done before.\"<ref name=mh/> They felt the showrunner should not stay for more than two seasons.<ref name=simp/> Due to the pressures of having to work on two seasons at once (writing season eight, whilst doing post-production of season seven), Oakley said that at least two episodes from season eight would ideally have been rewritten, had there been sufficient time,<ref name=nohomers2/> and that towards the end, they were \"treading water\".<ref name=port/> As they were working on [[post-production]] of season eight, they were credited as consulting producers for [[The Simpsons|season nine]], which was in its initial writing stages.<ref name=\"NoHomers\"/> Oakley stated that they contributed \"somewhere between 0 and .0001%\" of the season, only attending the table readings of the scripts.<ref name=\"NoHomers\"/> They produced three episodes held over from season eight, which aired as part of season nine: \"[[The City of New York vs. Homer Simpson]]\",<ref>{{cite video|people=Oakley, Bill|date=2006|title=The Simpsons The Complete Ninth Season DVD commentary for the episode \"The City of New York vs. Homer Simpson\"|medium=DVD|publisher=20th Century Fox}}</ref> \"[[The Principal and the Pauper]]\" and \"[[Lisa the Simpson]]\". \"The Principal and the Pauper\" was negatively received due the sudden revelation that long-time character [[Seymour Skinner]] was actually an imposter. For example, in his book ''[[Planet Simpson]]'', [[Chris Turner (author)|Chris Turner]] describes \"The Principal and the Pauper\" as the \"broadcast that marked [the] abrupt plunge\" from ''The Simpsons''<nowiki>'</nowiki> \"Golden Age\", which he says began in the middle of the show's [[The Simpsons (season 3)|third season]]. He calls the episode \"[one of] the weakest episodes in ''Simpsons'' history\".{{sfn|Turner|2004|pp=41\u201342}} As such, they consider it the most controversial episode from their tenure as executive producers. He and Oakley advise viewers to treat \"The Principal and the Pauper\" as an \"experiment\". They surmise that the negative reception was partly due to the fact that it was not immediately apparent to viewers that this was such an episode (as opposed to, for example, \"[[The Simpsons Spin-Off Showcase]]\"). They describe the ending of the episode as an attempt to reset the continuity and allow fans to consider the episode on its own.<ref>Oakley, Bill; Weinstein, Josh. (2006).

The staff felt the 3D animation sequence \"Homer\u00b3\" would have given it the edge. The episode eventually lost to ''[[Pinky and the Brain]]''.

[But] this show is definitely a case where a lot of people don't get it. It's not setup, setup, setup, punch line. It's observational humor. It's jokes told in a weird way, in the background or with a bizarre sound effect.\"<ref name=mh/> The show was plagued by \"public relations\" difficulties, which meant it was \"tarnished\" from the start. A badly edited two-minute promotional video for the show, sent to advertisers in April 1999 for the annual [[Upfront (advertising)|upfront]]s, was poorly received. Oakley and Weinstein had been informed that the upfronts did not matter.<ref name=mh/> Similarly, because no episodes were finished in time, journalists were not able to see anything of the show at the network's schedule presentation in July. Subsequently, as Weinstein commented to the ''[[Washington Post]]'', \"for seven months, the only impression people had of the show was based on a two-minute tape that looked terrible.

Levosimendan exerts its positive [[inotrope|inotropic]] effect by increasing calcium sensitivity of [[myocyte]]s by binding to cardiac [[troponin|troponin C]] in a calcium-dependent manner. It also has a [[vasodilation|vasodilatory]] effect, by opening [[adenosine triphosphate]] (ATP)-sensitive [[potassium]] channels in vascular [[smooth muscle]] to cause smooth muscle relaxation. The combined inotropic and vasodilatory actions result in an increased force of contraction, decreased [[Preload (cardiology)|preload]] and decreased [[afterload]]. Moreover, by opening also the mitochondrial (ATP)-sensitive potassium channels in cardiomyocytes, the drug exerts a cardioprotective effect.<ref name = \"Papp\">{{cite journal | vauthors = Papp Z, \u00c9des I, Fruhwald S, De Hert SG, Salmenper\u00e4 M, Leppikangas H, Mebazaa A, Landoni G, Grossini E, Caimmi P, Morelli A, Guarracino F, Schwinger RH, Meyer S, Algotsson L, Wikstr\u00f6m BG, J\u00f6rgensen K, Filippatos G, Parissis JT, Gonz\u00e1lez MJ, Parkhomenko A, Yilmaz MB, Kivikko M, Pollesello P, Follath F | display-authors = 6 | title = Levosimendan: molecular mechanisms and clinical implications: consensus of experts on the mechanisms of action of levosimendan | journal = International Journal of Cardiology | volume = 159 | issue = 2 | pages = 82\u20137 | date = August 2012 | pmid = 21784540 | doi = 10.1016/j.ijcard.2011.07.022 | url = http://transmed.almazovcentre.ru/jour/article/view/72 }}</ref>\n\n== Clinical use ==\n\n=== Indications ===\nLevosimendan is indicated for inotropic support in acutely-[[decompensation|decompensated]] severe [[congestive heart failure]] in situations where conventional therapy is not sufficient, and in cases where inotropic support is considered appropriate. \n\nSome of the Phase III studies in the extensive clinical program including the trials LIDO (200 patients), RUSSLAN (500), REVIVE-I (100), REVIVE-II (600) and SURVIVE (1350).

It is marketed under the [[trade name]] '''Simdax''' ([[Orion Corporation]]).\n\n== Mechanism of action ==\nLevosimendan is a calcium sensitizer \u2014 it increases the sensitivity of the heart to calcium, thus increasing cardiac contractility without a rise in intracellular calcium. Levosimendan exerts its positive [[inotrope|inotropic]] effect by increasing calcium sensitivity of [[myocyte]]s by binding to cardiac [[troponin|troponin C]] in a calcium-dependent manner. It also has a [[vasodilation|vasodilatory]] effect, by opening [[adenosine triphosphate]] (ATP)-sensitive [[potassium]] channels in vascular [[smooth muscle]] to cause smooth muscle relaxation. The combined inotropic and vasodilatory actions result in an increased force of contraction, decreased [[Preload (cardiology)|preload]] and decreased [[afterload]]. Moreover, by opening also the mitochondrial (ATP)-sensitive potassium channels in cardiomyocytes, the drug exerts a cardioprotective effect.<ref name = \"Papp\">{{cite journal | vauthors = Papp Z, \u00c9des I, Fruhwald S, De Hert SG, Salmenper\u00e4 M, Leppikangas H, Mebazaa A, Landoni G, Grossini E, Caimmi P, Morelli A, Guarracino F, Schwinger RH, Meyer S, Algotsson L, Wikstr\u00f6m BG, J\u00f6rgensen K, Filippatos G, Parissis JT, Gonz\u00e1lez MJ, Parkhomenko A, Yilmaz MB, Kivikko M, Pollesello P, Follath F | display-authors = 6 | title = Levosimendan: molecular mechanisms and clinical implications: consensus of experts on the mechanisms of action of levosimendan | journal = International Journal of Cardiology | volume = 159 | issue = 2 | pages = 82\u20137 | date = August 2012 | pmid = 21784540 | doi = 10.1016/j.ijcard.2011.07.022 | url = http://transmed.almazovcentre.ru/jour/article/view/72 }}</ref>\n\n== Clinical use ==\n\n=== Indications ===\nLevosimendan is indicated for inotropic support in acutely-[[decompensation|decompensated]] severe [[congestive heart failure]] in situations where conventional therapy is not sufficient, and in cases where inotropic support is considered appropriate. \n\nSome of the Phase III studies in the extensive clinical program including the trials LIDO (200 patients), RUSSLAN (500), REVIVE-I (100), REVIVE-II (600) and SURVIVE (1350).

An [[air compressor]] is a specific type of gas compressor.\n\nCompressors are similar to [[pump]]s: both increase the pressure on a [[fluid]] and both can transport the fluid through a [[pipe (material)|pipe]]. As gases are compressible, the compressor also reduces the volume of a gas. Liquids are relatively incompressible; while some can be compressed, the main action of a pump is to pressurize and transport liquids.\n\nMany compressors can be staged, that is, the fluid is compressed several times in steps or stages, to increase discharge pressure. Often, the second stage is physically smaller than the primary stage, to accommodate the already compressed gas. Each stage further compresses the gas and increases pressure. Those that are powered by an electric motor can also be controlled using a [[Variable-frequency drive|VFD]] or [[power inverter]], however many (hermetic and semi-hermetic) compressors can only work at certain speeds, since they may include built-in oil pumps. The oil pumps are connected to the same shaft that drives the compressor and forces oil into the compressor and motor bearings. At low speeds, insufficient quantities or no oil is forced into the bearings, eventually leading to bearing failure, while at high speeds, excessive amounts of oil may be lost from the bearings and compressor and potentially into the discharge line due to splashing. Eventually the oil runs out and the bearings are left unlubricated, again leading to failure, and the oil may contaminate the refrigerant, air or other working gas. <ref>{{Cite web|url=https://toshiba-mirai-kagakukan.jp/en/learn/history/ichigoki/1981aircon/index.htm|title=Toshiba Science Museum : World's First Residential Inverter Air Conditioner|website=toshiba-mirai-kagakukan.jp}}</ref>\n\n==Types of compressors==\nThe main and important types of gas compressors are illustrated and discussed below:\n[[File:Gas-compressors-types-yed.png|frame|center]]\n\n===Positive displacement===\nA positive displacement compressor is the system which compresses the air by the displacement of a mechanical linkage reducing the volume (since the reduction in volume due to a piston in thermodynamics is considered as positive displacement of the piston).{{vague|date=May 2018}}\n\nPut another way, a positive displacement compressor is one which operates by drawing in a discrete volume of gas from its inlet then forcing that gas to exit via the compressor's outlet.  The increase in the pressure of the gas is due, at least in part, to the compressor pumping it at a mass flow rate which cannot pass through the outlet at the lower pressure and density of the inlet.\n\n====Reciprocating compressors====\n\n{{main article|Reciprocating compressor}}\n[[File:ReciprocatingCompressor.jpg|right|thumb|A motor-driven six-cylinder reciprocating compressor that can operate with two, four or six cylinders.]]\n'''Reciprocating compressors''' use [[piston]]s driven by a crankshaft.

The rotor is mounted offset in a larger housing that is either circular or a more complex shape. As the rotor turns, blades slide in and out of the slots keeping contact with the outer wall of the housing.<ref name=Perry/> Thus, a series of increasing and decreasing volumes is created by the rotating blades. Rotary Vane compressors are, with piston compressors one of the oldest of compressor technologies.\n\nWith suitable port connections, the devices may be either a compressor or a vacuum pump. They can be either stationary or portable, can be single or multi-staged, and can be driven by electric motors or internal combustion engines. Dry vane machines are used at relatively low pressures (e.g., {{convert|2|bar|kPa psi|abbr=on|disp=or}}) for bulk material movement while oil-injected machines have the necessary volumetric efficiency to achieve pressures up to about {{convert|13|bar|kPa psi|abbr=on}} in a single stage. A rotary vane compressor is well suited to electric motor drive and is significantly quieter in operation than the equivalent piston compressor.\n\nRotary vane compressors can have mechanical efficiencies of about 90%.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.matteicomp.com/|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100509233715/http://www.matteicomp.com/compressor-news.htm?id=165176063|url-status=dead|title=Rotary Vane Compressors and the Vane Compressor - Compressors for stationary industrial and OEM applications - Mattei|first=Mattei Compressors|last=Inc|archivedate=May 9, 2010|website=www.matteicomp.com}}</ref>\n\n====Rolling piston====\n\n[[File:Rollkolbenverdichter.png|thumb|Rolling piston compressor]]\nThe Rolling piston in a rolling piston style compressor plays the part of a partition between the vane and the rotor.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://docs.lib.purdue.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1390&context=icec|title=Motion of Rolling Piston in Rotary Compressor|website=Purdue University|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170816232859/http://docs.lib.purdue.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1390&context=icec|archive-date=2017-08-16|url-status=live|access-date=2017-08-16}}</ref> Rolling piston forces gas against a stationary vane.\n\n2 of these compressors can be mounted on the same shaft to increase capacity and reduce vibration and noise.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://news.samsung.com/global/what-the-new-samsung-mini-rotary-compressor-means|title=What the New Samsung Mini Rotary Compressor Means|website=news.samsung.com}}</ref> A design without a spring is known as a swing compressor.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.daikin.com/products/ac/lineup/skyair/|title=High Efficiency Compressor to Achieve a High COP &#124; Air Conditioning and Refrigeration &#124; Daikin Global|website=www.daikin.com}}</ref>\n\nIn refrigeration and air conditioning, this type of compressor is also known as a rotary compressor, with rotary screw compressors being also known simply as screw compressors.\n\nIt offers higher efficiency than reciprocating compressors due to less losses from the clearance volume between the piston and the compressor casing, its 40% to 50% smaller and lighter for a given capacity (which can impact material and shipping costs when used in a product), causes less vibration, has fewer components and is more reliable than a reciprocating compressor. But its structure does not allow capacities beyond 5 refrigeration tons, is less reliable than other compressor types, and is less efficient than other compressor types due to losses from the clearance volume. <ref name=\"autogenerated1\"/>\n\n====Scroll compressors====\n\n[[File:Two moving spirals scroll pump.gif|thumb|right|Mechanism of a scroll pump]]\n{{main article|Scroll compressor}}\nA '''scroll compressor''', also known as '''scroll pump''' and '''scroll vacuum pump''', uses two interleaved spiral-like vanes to [[pump]] or compress [[fluid]]s such as [[liquids]] and [[gas]]es.

They are more expensive though, so peltier coolers or rotary and reciprocating compressors may be used in applications where cost is the most important or one of the most important factors to consider when designing a refrigeration or air conditioining system.\n\nThis type of compressor was used as the [[G-Lader|supercharger]] on Volkswagen G60 and G40 engines in the early 1990s.\n\nWhen compared with reciprocating and rolling piston compressors, scroll compressors are more reliable since they have fewer components and have a simpler structure, is more efficient since they have no clearance volume nor valves, has less surging and it doesn't vibrate as much. But, when compared with screw and centrifugal compressors, scroll compressors have lower efficiencies and smaller capacities. <ref><ref name=\"autogenerated1\"/>\n\n====Diaphragm compressors====\n\n{{main article|Diaphragm compressor}}\nA '''diaphragm compressor''' (also known as a '''membrane compressor''') is a variant of the conventional reciprocating compressor. The compression of gas occurs by the movement of a flexible membrane, instead of an intake element. The back and forth movement of the membrane is driven by a rod and a crankshaft mechanism. Only the membrane and the compressor box come in contact with the gas being compressed.<ref name=Perry/>\n\nThe degree of flexing and the material constituting the diaphragm affects the maintenance life of the equipment. Generally stiff metal diaphragms may only displace a few cubic centimeters of volume because the metal can not endure large degrees of flexing without cracking, but the stiffness of a metal diaphragm allows it to pump at high pressures. Rubber or silicone diaphragms are capable of enduring deep pumping strokes of very high flexion, but their low strength limits their use to low-pressure applications, and they need to be replaced as plastic embrittlement occurs.\n\nDiaphragm compressors are used for hydrogen and compressed natural gas ([[Compressed natural gas|CNG]]) as well as in a number of other applications.\n\n[[File:DiaphragmCompressor.jpg|thumb|right|A three-stage diaphragm compressor]]\nThe photograph on the right depicts a three-stage diaphragm compressor used to compress hydrogen gas to {{convert|6000|psi|MPa|abbr=on}} for use in a prototype [[compressed hydrogen]] and [[compressed natural gas]] (CNG) fueling station built in downtown [[Phoenix, Arizona]] by the [[Arizona Public Service]] company (an electric utilities company). [[Reciprocating compressor]]s were used to compress the [[natural gas]]. The reciprocating natural gas compressor was developed by [[Sertco]].<ref>{{cite journal | author=Eric Slack | title=Sertco | date=Winter 2016 | url=http://www.emi-magazine.com/index.php/featured-content/1067-sertco | publisher=Phoenix Media Corporation | work=Energy and Mining International | accessdate=February 27, 2016 | url-status=live | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304170914/http://www.emi-magazine.com/index.php/featured-content/1067-sertco | archivedate=March 4, 2016 }}</ref>\n\nThe prototype [[alternative fuel]]ing station was built in compliance with all of the prevailing safety, environmental and building codes in Phoenix to demonstrate that such fueling stations could be built in urban areas.\n\n===Dynamic===\nDynamic compressors depend upon the [[inertia]] and [[momentum]] of a fluid.\n\n====Air bubble compressor====\nAlso known as a [[trompe]]. A mixture of air and water generated through turbulence is allowed to fall into a subterranean chamber where the air separates from the water. The weight of falling water compresses the air in the top of the chamber. A submerged outlet from the chamber allows water to flow to the surface at a lower height than the intake. An outlet in the roof of the chamber supplies the compressed air to the surface. A facility on this principle was built on the [[Montreal River (Timiskaming District)|Montreal River]] at Ragged Shutes near [[Cobalt, Ontario]] in 1910 and supplied 5,000 horsepower to nearby mines.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Maynard|first=Frank|date=November 1910|title=Five thousand horsepower from air bubbles|journal=Popular Mechanics|page=Page 633|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-N0DAAAAMBAJ&printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&q&f=false|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170326071901/https://books.google.com/books?id=-N0DAAAAMBAJ&printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&q&f=false|archivedate=2017-03-26}}</ref>\n\n====Centrifugal compressors====\n[[File:CentrifugalCompressor.jpg|thumb|right|A single stage centrifugal compressor]]\n[[File:Fan, before 1945.jpg|thumb|right|A single stage centrifugal compressor, early 1900s, G.

Magnetically levitated and air bearing centrifugal compressors exist.\n\nMany large [[snowmaking]] operations (like [[ski resorts]]) use this type of compressor. They are also used in internal combustion engines as [[supercharger]]s and [[turbocharger]]s. Centrifugal compressors are used in small [[gas turbine]] [[engine]]s or as the final compression stage of medium-sized gas turbines.\n\nCentrifugal compressors are the largest available compressors, offer higher efficiencies under partial loads, may be oil-free when using air or magnetic bearings which increases the heat transfer coefficient in evaporators and condensers, weigh up to 90% less and occupy 50% less space than reciprocating compressors, are reliable and cost less to mantain since less components are exposed to wear, and only generate minimal vibration. But, their initial cost is higher, require highly precise [[CNC]] machining, the impeller needs to rotate at high speeds making small compressors impractical, and surging becomes more likely. <ref name=autogenerated1 /> Surging is gas flow reversal, meaning that the gas goes from the discharge to the suction side, which can cause serious damage, specially in the compressor bearings and its drive shaft. It is caused by a pressure on the discharge side that is higher than the output pressure of the compressor. This can cause gases to flow back and forth between the compressor and whatever is connected to its discharge line, causing oscillations. <ref name=\"autogenerated1\"/>\n\n====Diagonal or mixed-flow compressors====\n'''Diagonal''' or '''[[mixed-flow compressor]]s''' are similar to centrifugal compressors, but have a radial and axial velocity component at the exit from the rotor.

They are used where high flow rates or a compact design are required.\n\nThe arrays of airfoils are set in rows, usually as pairs: one rotating and one stationary. The rotating airfoils, also known as blades or ''rotors'', accelerate the fluid. The stationary airfoils, also known as ''stators'' or vanes, decelerate and redirect the flow direction of the fluid, preparing it for the rotor blades of the next stage.<ref name=Perry /> Axial compressors are almost always multi-staged, with the cross-sectional area of the gas passage diminishing along the compressor to maintain an optimum axial [[Mach number]]. Beyond about 5 stages or a 4:1 design pressure ratio a compressor will not function unless fitted with features such as stationary vanes with variable angles (known as variable inlet guide vanes and variable stators), the ability to allow some air to escape part-way along the compressor (known as interstage bleed) and being split into more than one rotating assembly (known as twin spools, for example).\n\nAxial compressors can have high efficiencies; around 90% [[polytropic]] at their design conditions. However, they are relatively expensive, requiring a large number of components, tight tolerances and high quality materials. Axial compressors are used in medium to large [[gas turbine]] engines, natural gas pumping stations, and some chemical plants.\n\n==={{Anchor|Hermetically-sealed compressor}} Hermetically sealed, open, or semi-hermetic===\n[[File:Ledni\u010dka Zanussi ZRA 319 SW, kompresor s odpa\u0159ovac\u00ed miskou (002).JPG|thumb|A small hermetically sealed compressor in a common consumer [[refrigerator]] or [[freezer]] typically has a rounded steel outer shell permanently welded shut, which seals operating gases inside the system. There is no route for gases to leak, such as around motor shaft seals. On this model, the plastic top section is part of an [[auto-defrost]] system that uses motor heat to evaporate the water.]]\n\nCompressors used in refrigeration systems are often described as being either hermetic, open, or semi-hermetic, to describe how the compressor and [[Electric motor|motor]] drive are situated in relation to the gas or vapor being compressed. The industry name for a hermetic is '''hermetically sealed compressor''', while a semi-hermetic is commonly called a '''semi-hermetic compressor'''.\n\nIn hermetic and most semi-hermetic compressors, the compressor and motor driving the compressor are integrated, and operate within the pressurized gas envelope of the system. The motor is designed to operate in, and be cooled by, the refrigerant gas being compressed.\n\nThe difference between the hermetic and semi-hermetic, is that the hermetic uses a one-piece welded steel casing that cannot be opened for repair; if the hermetic fails it is simply replaced with an entire new unit. A semi-hermetic uses a large cast metal shell with gasketed covers with screws that can be opened to replace motor and compressor components.\n\nThe primary advantage of a hermetic and semi-hermetic is that there is no route for the gas to leak out of the system. Open compressors rely on shaft seals to retain the internal pressure, and these seals require a lubricant such as oil to retain their sealing properties.\n\nAn open pressurized system such as an automobile air conditioner can be more susceptible to leak its operating gases. Open systems rely on lubricant in the system to splash on pump components and seals. If it is not operated frequently enough, the lubricant on the seals slowly evaporates, and then the seals begin to leak until the system is no longer functional and must be recharged. By comparison, a hermetic or semi-hermetic system can sit unused for years, and can usually be started up again at any time without requiring maintenance or experiencing any loss of system pressure.\n\nThe disadvantage of hermetic compressors is that the motor drive cannot be repaired or maintained, and the entire compressor must be replaced if a motor fails. A further disadvantage is that burnt-out windings can contaminate whole systems, thereby requiring the system to be entirely pumped down and the gas replaced (This can also happen in semi hermetic compressors where the motor operates in the refrigerant). Typically, hermetic compressors are used in low-cost factory-assembled consumer goods where the cost of repair and labor is high compared to the value of the device, and it would be more economical to just purchase a new device or compressor. Semi-hermetic compressors are used in mid-sized to large refrigeration and air conditioning systems, where it is cheaper to repair the compressor rather than buying and installing a new one. A hermetic compressor is simpler and cheaper to build than a semi-hermetic compressor.\n\nAn advantage of open compressors is that they can be driven by non-electric power sources, such as an [[internal combustion engine]] or [[turbine]]. However, open compressors that drive refrigeration systems are generally not totally ''maintenance-free'' throughout the life of the system, since some gas leakage will occur over time.\n\n==Thermodynamics of gas compression==\n\n===Isentropic compressor===\nA compressor can be idealized as internally reversible and [[adiabatic]], thus an [[isentropic]] steady state device, meaning the change in [[entropy]] is 0.<ref name=\"Cengel, Yunus A. 2012\">Cengel, Yunus A., and Michaeul A.

Theoretical temperature rise is:<ref>''Perry's Chemical Engineer's Handbook'' 8th edition\nPerry, Green, page 10-45 section 10-76</ref>\n: <math> T_2 = T_1 \\left(\\frac {p_2}{p_1}\\right)^{(\\kappa-1)/\\kappa} </math>\nwith ''T''<sub>1</sub> and ''T''<sub>2</sub> in degrees [[Rankine scale|Rankine]] or [[kelvin]]s, ''p''<sub>2</sub> and ''p''<sub>1</sub> being absolute pressures and <math>\\kappa = </math> [[Heat capacity ratio|ratio of specific heat]]s (approximately 1.4 for air).  The rise in air and temperature ratio means compression does not follow a simple pressure to volume ratio. This is less efficient, but quick. Adiabatic compression or expansion more closely model real life when a compressor has good insulation, a large gas volume, or a short time scale (i.e., a high power level). In practice there will always be a certain amount of heat flow out of the compressed gas. Thus, making a perfect adiabatic compressor would require perfect heat insulation of all parts of the machine. For example, even a bicycle tire pump's metal tube becomes hot as you compress the air to fill a tire.\nThe relation between temperature and compression ratio described above means that the value of <math>n</math> for an adiabatic process is <math>\\kappa</math> (the ratio of specific heats).\n\n{{anchor|Isothermal}}\n* [[Isothermal process|Isothermal]] - This model assumes that the compressed gas remains at a constant temperature throughout the compression or expansion process. In this cycle, internal energy is removed from the system as heat at the same rate that it is added by the mechanical work of compression. Isothermal compression or expansion more closely models real life when the compressor has a large heat exchanging surface, a small gas volume, or a long time scale (i.e., a small power level). Compressors that utilize inter-stage cooling between compression stages come closest to achieving perfect isothermal compression. However, with practical devices perfect isothermal compression is not attainable. For example, unless you have an infinite number of compression stages with corresponding intercoolers, you will never achieve perfect isothermal compression.\n\nFor an isothermal process, <math>n</math> is 1, so the value of the work integral for an isothermal process is:\n: <math>W = - {p_1} {V_1} \\ln \\left( \\frac {p_2} {p_1} \\right)</math>\n\nWhen evaluated, the isothermal work is found to be lower than the adiabatic work.\n\n{{anchor|Polytropic}}\n* [[Polytropic process|Polytropic]] - This model takes into account both a rise in temperature in the gas as well as some loss of energy (heat) to the compressor's components. This assumes that heat may enter or leave the system, and that input shaft work can appear as both increased pressure (usually useful work) and increased temperature above adiabatic (usually losses due to cycle efficiency). Compression efficiency is then the ratio of temperature rise at theoretical 100 percent (adiabatic) vs. actual (polytropic). Polytropic compression will use a value of <math>n</math> between 0 (a constant-pressure process) and infinity (a constant volume process). For the typical case where an effort is made to cool the gas compressed by an approximately adiabatic process, the value of <math>n</math> will be between 1 and <math>\\kappa</math>.\n\n==Staged compression==\nIn the case of centrifugal compressors, commercial designs currently do not exceed a compression ratio of more than 3.5 to 1 in any one stage (for a typical gas). Since compression raises the temperature, the compressed gas is to be cooled between stages making the compression less adiabatic and more isothermal. The inter-stage coolers typically result in some partial condensation that is removed in [[vapor-liquid separator]]s.\n\nIn the case of small reciprocating compressors, the compressor flywheel may drive a cooling fan that directs ambient air across the [[intercooler]] of a two or more stage compressor.\n\nBecause rotary screw compressors can make use of cooling lubricant to reduce the temperature rise from compression, they very often exceed a 9 to 1 compression ratio. For instance, in a typical diving compressor the air is compressed in three stages. If each stage has a compression ratio of 7 to 1, the compressor can output 343 times atmospheric pressure (7 \u00d7 7 \u00d7 7 = 343 [[atmosphere (unit)|atmosphere]]s). ({{convert|343|atm|MPa ksi|sigfig=3|abbr=on|lk=out|disp=or}})\n\n==Drive motors==\nThere are many options for the motor that powers the compressor:\n* Gas [[turbine]]s power the axial and centrifugal flow compressors that are part of [[jet engine]]s.\n* [[Steam turbine]]s or [[water turbine]]s are possible for large compressors.\n* [[Electric motor]]s are cheap and quiet for static compressors. Small motors suitable for domestic electrical supplies use [[Single-phase electric power|single-phase]] [[alternating current]]. Larger motors can only be used where an industrial electrical [[Three-phase electric power|three phase]] alternating current supply is available.\n* [[Diesel engine]]s or [[petrol engine]]s are suitable for portable compressors and support compressors. \n* In automobiles and other types of vehicles (including piston-powered airplanes, boats, trucks, etc.), diesel or gasoline engines power output can be increased by compressing the intake air, so that more fuel can be burned per cycle. These engines can power compressors using their own crankshaft power (this setup known as a [[supercharger]]), or, use their exhaust gas to drive a turbine connected to the compressor (this setup known as a [[turbocharger]]).\n\n==Applications==\nGas compressors are used in various applications where either higher pressures or lower volumes of gas are needed:\n* In [[pipeline transport]] of purified natural gas from the production site to the consumer, a compressor is driven by a gas turbine fueled by gas bled from the pipeline. Thus, no external power source is necessary.\n* Petroleum refineries, natural gas processing plants, petrochemical and chemical plants, and similar large industrial plants require compressing for intermediate and end-product gases.\n* [[Refrigeration]] and [[air conditioner]] equipment use compressors to move [[heat]] in [[refrigerant]] cycles (see ''[[vapor-compression refrigeration]]'').\n* Gas turbine systems compress the intake [[combustion]] air.\n* Small-volume purified or manufactured gases require compression to fill high pressure cylinders for [[medical]], [[welding]], and other uses.\n* Various industrial, manufacturing, and building processes require [[compressed air]] to power [[pneumatic tools]].\n* In the manufacturing and blow moulding of PET plastic bottles and containers.\n* Some aircraft require compressors to maintain [[cabin pressurization]] at altitude.\n* Some types of [[jet engine]]s\u2014such as [[turbojet]]s and [[turbofan]]s\u2014compress the air required for fuel combustion.

An [[air compressor]] is a specific type of gas compressor.\n\nCompressors are similar to [[pump]]s: both increase the pressure on a [[fluid]] and both can transport the fluid through a [[pipe (material)|pipe]]. As gases are compressible, the compressor also reduces the volume of a gas. Liquids are relatively incompressible; while some can be compressed, the main action of a pump is to pressurize and transport liquids.\n\nMany compressors can be staged, that is, the fluid is compressed several times in steps or stages, to increase discharge pressure. Often, the second stage is physically smaller than the primary stage, to accommodate the already compressed gas. Each stage further compresses the gas and increases pressure. Those that are powered by an electric motor can also be controlled using a [[Variable-frequency drive|VFD]] or [[power inverter]], however many (hermetic and semi-hermetic) compressors can only work at certain speeds, since they may include built-in oil pumps. The oil pumps are connected to the same shaft that drives the compressor and forces oil into the compressor and motor bearings. At low speeds, insufficient quantities or no oil is forced into the bearings, eventually leading to bearing failure, while at high speeds, excessive amounts of oil may be lost from the bearings and compressor and potentially into the discharge line due to splashing. Eventually the oil runs out and the bearings are left unlubricated, again leading to failure, and the oil may contaminate the refrigerant, air or other working gas. <ref>{{Cite web|url=https://toshiba-mirai-kagakukan.jp/en/learn/history/ichigoki/1981aircon/index.htm|title=Toshiba Science Museum : World's First Residential Inverter Air Conditioner|website=toshiba-mirai-kagakukan.jp}}</ref>\n\n==Types of compressors==\nThe main and important types of gas compressors are illustrated and discussed below:\n[[File:Gas-compressors-types-yed.png|frame|center]]\n\n===Positive displacement===\nA positive displacement compressor is the system which compresses the air by the displacement of a mechanical linkage reducing the volume (since the reduction in volume due to a piston in thermodynamics is considered as positive displacement of the piston).{{vague|date=May 2018}}\n\nPut another way, a positive displacement compressor is one which operates by drawing in a discrete volume of gas from its inlet then forcing that gas to exit via the compressor's outlet.  The increase in the pressure of the gas is due, at least in part, to the compressor pumping it at a mass flow rate which cannot pass through the outlet at the lower pressure and density of the inlet.\n\n====Reciprocating compressors====\n\n{{main article|Reciprocating compressor}}\n[[File:ReciprocatingCompressor.jpg|right|thumb|A motor-driven six-cylinder reciprocating compressor that can operate with two, four or six cylinders.]]\n'''Reciprocating compressors''' use [[piston]]s driven by a crankshaft.

[[discharge pressure|Discharge pressures]] can range from low pressure to very high pressure (>18000 psi or 180 MPa).

Because of this, it finds use in a wide range of applications in many different industries and can be designed to a wide range of capacities, by varying size, number of cylinders, and cylinder unloading. However, it suffers from higher losses due to clearance volumes, resistance due to discharge and suction valves, weighs more, is difficult to mantain due to having a large number of moving parts, and it has inherent vibration. <ref name=\"autogenerated1\">https://download.schneider-electric.com/files?p_Doc_Ref=SPD_VAVR-AE7T7G_EN</ref>\n\n====Ionic liquid piston compressor====\n\n{{main article|Ionic liquid piston compressor}}\nAn [[ionic liquid piston compressor]], ''ionic compressor'' or ''ionic liquid piston pump'' is a [[hydrogen compressor]] based on an [[ionic liquid]] piston instead of a metal piston as in a piston-metal [[diaphragm compressor]].<ref>[https://www.air-compressorsdirect.co.uk/]{{|date=November 2019 |bot=KAP03 |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref>\n\n====Rotary screw compressors====\n\n[[File:RotaryScrewCompressor.gif|thumb|right|Diagram of a rotary screw compressor]]\n{{main article|Rotary screw compressor}}\n'''Rotary screw compressors''' use two meshed rotating positive-displacement [[Helix|helical screws]] to force the gas into a smaller space.<ref name=Perry/><ref>[http://www.blackmer.com/tech-screw.jsp Screw Compressor] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080110103341/http://www.blackmer.com/tech-screw.jsp |date=2008-01-10 }} Describes how screw compressors work and include photographs.</ref><ref>[http://www.domnickhunter.com/tech_Centre.asp?chapter=1&section=3_Screw-Compressors_2_3.htm&getIndex=false Technical Centre] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071213211548/http://www.domnickhunter.com/tech_Centre.asp?chapter=1&section=3_Screw-Compressors_2_3.htm&getIndex=false |date=2007-12-13 }} Discusses oil-flooded screw compressors including a complete system flow diagram</ref> These are usually used for continuous operation in commercial and industrial applications and may be either stationary or portable.

The rotor is mounted offset in a larger housing that is either circular or a more complex shape. As the rotor turns, blades slide in and out of the slots keeping contact with the outer wall of the housing.<ref name=Perry/> Thus, a series of increasing and decreasing volumes is created by the rotating blades. Rotary Vane compressors are, with piston compressors one of the oldest of compressor technologies.\n\nWith suitable port connections, the devices may be either a compressor or a vacuum pump. They can be either stationary or portable, can be single or multi-staged, and can be driven by electric motors or internal combustion engines. Dry vane machines are used at relatively low pressures (e.g., {{convert|2|bar|kPa psi|abbr=on|disp=or}}) for bulk material movement while oil-injected machines have the necessary volumetric efficiency to achieve pressures up to about {{convert|13|bar|kPa psi|abbr=on}} in a single stage. A rotary vane compressor is well suited to electric motor drive and is significantly quieter in operation than the equivalent piston compressor.\n\nRotary vane compressors can have mechanical efficiencies of about 90%.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.matteicomp.com/|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100509233715/http://www.matteicomp.com/compressor-news.htm?id=165176063|url-status=dead|title=Rotary Vane Compressors and the Vane Compressor - Compressors for stationary industrial and OEM applications - Mattei|first=Mattei Compressors|last=Inc|archivedate=May 9, 2010|website=www.matteicomp.com}}</ref>\n\n====Rolling piston====\n\n[[File:Rollkolbenverdichter.png|thumb|Rolling piston compressor]]\nThe Rolling piston in a rolling piston style compressor plays the part of a partition between the vane and the rotor.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://docs.lib.purdue.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1390&context=icec|title=Motion of Rolling Piston in Rotary Compressor|website=Purdue University|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170816232859/http://docs.lib.purdue.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1390&context=icec|archive-date=2017-08-16|url-status=live|access-date=2017-08-16}}</ref> Rolling piston forces gas against a stationary vane.\n\n2 of these compressors can be mounted on the same shaft to increase capacity and reduce vibration and noise.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://news.samsung.com/global/what-the-new-samsung-mini-rotary-compressor-means|title=What the New Samsung Mini Rotary Compressor Means|website=news.samsung.com}}</ref> A design without a spring is known as a swing compressor.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.daikin.com/products/ac/lineup/skyair/|title=High Efficiency Compressor to Achieve a High COP &#124; Air Conditioning and Refrigeration &#124; Daikin Global|website=www.daikin.com}}</ref>\n\nIn refrigeration and air conditioning, this type of compressor is also known as a rotary compressor, with rotary screw compressors being also known simply as screw compressors.\n\nIt offers higher efficiency than reciprocating compressors due to less losses from the clearance volume between the piston and the compressor casing, its 40% to 50% smaller and lighter for a given capacity (which can impact material and shipping costs when used in a product), causes less vibration, has fewer components and is more reliable than a reciprocating compressor. But its structure does not allow capacities beyond 5 refrigeration tons, is less reliable than other compressor types, and is less efficient than other compressor types due to losses from the clearance volume. <ref name=\"autogenerated1\"/>\n\n====Scroll compressors====\n\n[[File:Two moving spirals scroll pump.gif|thumb|right|Mechanism of a scroll pump]]\n{{main article|Scroll compressor}}\nA '''scroll compressor''', also known as '''scroll pump''' and '''scroll vacuum pump''', uses two interleaved spiral-like vanes to [[pump]] or compress [[fluid]]s such as [[liquids]] and [[gas]]es. The vane geometry may be [[involute]], [[archimedean spiral]], or hybrid curves.<ref>Tischer, J., Utter, R: \u201cScroll Machine Using Discharge Pressure For Axial Sealing,\u201d U.S. Patent 4522575, 1985.</ref><ref>Caillat, J., Weatherston, R., Bush, J: \u201cScroll-Type Machine With Axially Compliant Mounting,\u201d U.S. Patent 4767293, 1988.</ref><ref>Richardson, Jr., Hubert: \u201cScroll Compressor With Orbiting Scroll Member Biased By Oil Pressure,\u201d U.S. Patent 4875838, 1989.</ref> They operate more smoothly, quietly, and reliably than other types of compressors in the lower volume range.\n\nOften, one of the scrolls is fixed, while the other orbits eccentrically without rotating, thereby trapping and pumping or compressing pockets of fluid between the scrolls.\n\nDue to minimum clearance volume between the fixed scroll and the orbiting scroll, these compressors have a very high [[volumetric efficiency]].\n\nThese compressors are extensively used in air conditioning and refrigeration because they are lighter, smaller and have fewer moving parts than reciprocating compressors and they are also more reliable. They are more expensive though, so peltier coolers or rotary and reciprocating compressors may be used in applications where cost is the most important or one of the most important factors to consider when designing a refrigeration or air conditioining system.\n\nThis type of compressor was used as the [[G-Lader|supercharger]] on Volkswagen G60 and G40 engines in the early 1990s.\n\nWhen compared with reciprocating and rolling piston compressors, scroll compressors are more reliable since they have fewer components and have a simpler structure, is more efficient since they have no clearance volume nor valves, has less surging and it doesn't vibrate as much. But, when compared with screw and centrifugal compressors, scroll compressors have lower efficiencies and smaller capacities. <ref><ref name=\"autogenerated1\"/></ref>\n\n====Diaphragm compressors====\n\n{{main article|Diaphragm compressor}}\nA '''diaphragm compressor''' (also known as a '''membrane compressor''') is a variant of the conventional reciprocating compressor. The compression of gas occurs by the movement of a flexible membrane, instead of an intake element. The back and forth movement of the membrane is driven by a rod and a crankshaft mechanism. Only the membrane and the compressor box come in contact with the gas being compressed.<ref name=Perry/>\n\nThe degree of flexing and the material constituting the diaphragm affects the maintenance life of the equipment. Generally stiff metal diaphragms may only displace a few cubic centimeters of volume because the metal can not endure large degrees of flexing without cracking, but the stiffness of a metal diaphragm allows it to pump at high pressures. Rubber or silicone diaphragms are capable of enduring deep pumping strokes of very high flexion, but their low strength limits their use to low-pressure applications, and they need to be replaced as plastic embrittlement occurs.\n\nDiaphragm compressors are used for hydrogen and compressed natural gas ([[Compressed natural gas|CNG]]) as well as in a number of other applications.\n\n[[File:DiaphragmCompressor.jpg|thumb|right|A three-stage diaphragm compressor]]\nThe photograph on the right depicts a three-stage diaphragm compressor used to compress hydrogen gas to {{convert|6000|psi|MPa|abbr=on}} for use in a prototype [[compressed hydrogen]] and [[compressed natural gas]] (CNG) fueling station built in downtown [[Phoenix, Arizona]] by the [[Arizona Public Service]] company (an electric utilities company).

A mixture of air and water generated through turbulence is allowed to fall into a subterranean chamber where the air separates from the water. The weight of falling water compresses the air in the top of the chamber. A submerged outlet from the chamber allows water to flow to the surface at a lower height than the intake. An outlet in the roof of the chamber supplies the compressed air to the surface. A facility on this principle was built on the [[Montreal River (Timiskaming District)|Montreal River]] at Ragged Shutes near [[Cobalt, Ontario]] in 1910 and supplied 5,000 horsepower to nearby mines.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Maynard|first=Frank|date=November 1910|title=Five thousand horsepower from air bubbles|journal=Popular Mechanics|page=Page 633|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-N0DAAAAMBAJ&printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&q&f=false|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170326071901/https://books.google.com/books?id=-N0DAAAAMBAJ&printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&q&f=false|archivedate=2017-03-26}}</ref>\n\n====Centrifugal compressors====\n[[File:CentrifugalCompressor.jpg|thumb|right|A single stage centrifugal compressor]]\n[[File:Fan, before 1945.jpg|thumb|right|A single stage centrifugal compressor, early 1900s, G.

Magnetically levitated and air bearing centrifugal compressors exist.\n\nMany large [[snowmaking]] operations (like [[ski resorts]]) use this type of compressor. They are also used in internal combustion engines as [[supercharger]]s and [[turbocharger]]s. Centrifugal compressors are used in small [[gas turbine]] [[engine]]s or as the final compression stage of medium-sized gas turbines.\n\nCentrifugal compressors are the largest available compressors, offer higher efficiencies under partial loads, may be oil-free when using air or magnetic bearings which increases the heat transfer coefficient in evaporators and condensers, weigh up to 90% less and occupy 50% less space than reciprocating compressors, are reliable and cost less to mantain since less components are exposed to wear, and only generate minimal vibration. But, their initial cost is higher, require highly precise [[CNC]] machining, the impeller needs to rotate at high speeds making small compressors impractical, and surging becomes more likely. <ref name=autogenerated1 /> Surging is gas flow reversal, meaning that the gas goes from the discharge to the suction side, which can cause serious damage, specially in the compressor bearings and its drive shaft. It is caused by a pressure on the discharge side that is higher than the output pressure of the compressor. This can cause gases to flow back and forth between the compressor and whatever is connected to its discharge line, causing oscillations. <ref name=\"autogenerated1\"/>\n\n====Diagonal or mixed-flow compressors====\n'''Diagonal''' or '''[[mixed-flow compressor]]s''' are similar to centrifugal compressors, but have a radial and axial velocity component at the exit from the rotor.

They are used where high flow rates or a compact design are required.\n\nThe arrays of airfoils are set in rows, usually as pairs: one rotating and one stationary. The rotating airfoils, also known as blades or ''rotors'', accelerate the fluid. The stationary airfoils, also known as ''stators'' or vanes, decelerate and redirect the flow direction of the fluid, preparing it for the rotor blades of the next stage.<ref name=Perry /> Axial compressors are almost always multi-staged, with the cross-sectional area of the gas passage diminishing along the compressor to maintain an optimum axial [[Mach number]]. Beyond about 5 stages or a 4:1 design pressure ratio a compressor will not function unless fitted with features such as stationary vanes with variable angles (known as variable inlet guide vanes and variable stators), the ability to allow some air to escape part-way along the compressor (known as interstage bleed) and being split into more than one rotating assembly (known as twin spools, for example).\n\nAxial compressors can have high efficiencies; around 90% [[polytropic]] at their design conditions. However, they are relatively expensive, requiring a large number of components, tight tolerances and high quality materials. Axial compressors are used in medium to large [[gas turbine]] engines, natural gas pumping stations, and some chemical plants.\n\n==={{Anchor|Hermetically-sealed compressor}} Hermetically sealed, open, or semi-hermetic===\n[[File:Ledni\u010dka Zanussi ZRA 319 SW, kompresor s odpa\u0159ovac\u00ed miskou (002).JPG|thumb|A small hermetically sealed compressor in a common consumer [[refrigerator]] or [[freezer]] typically has a rounded steel outer shell permanently welded shut, which seals operating gases inside the system. There is no route for gases to leak, such as around motor shaft seals. On this model, the plastic top section is part of an [[auto-defrost]] system that uses motor heat to evaporate the water.]]\n\nCompressors used in refrigeration systems are often described as being either hermetic, open, or semi-hermetic, to describe how the compressor and [[Electric motor|motor]] drive are situated in relation to the gas or vapor being compressed. The industry name for a hermetic is '''hermetically sealed compressor''', while a semi-hermetic is commonly called a '''semi-hermetic compressor'''.\n\nIn hermetic and most semi-hermetic compressors, the compressor and motor driving the compressor are integrated, and operate within the pressurized gas envelope of the system. The motor is designed to operate in, and be cooled by, the refrigerant gas being compressed.\n\nThe difference between the hermetic and semi-hermetic, is that the hermetic uses a one-piece welded steel casing that cannot be opened for repair; if the hermetic fails it is simply replaced with an entire new unit. A semi-hermetic uses a large cast metal shell with gasketed covers with screws that can be opened to replace motor and compressor components.\n\nThe primary advantage of a hermetic and semi-hermetic is that there is no route for the gas to leak out of the system. Open compressors rely on shaft seals to retain the internal pressure, and these seals require a lubricant such as oil to retain their sealing properties.\n\nAn open pressurized system such as an automobile air conditioner can be more susceptible to leak its operating gases. Open systems rely on lubricant in the system to splash on pump components and seals. If it is not operated frequently enough, the lubricant on the seals slowly evaporates, and then the seals begin to leak until the system is no longer functional and must be recharged. By comparison, a hermetic or semi-hermetic system can sit unused for years, and can usually be started up again at any time without requiring maintenance or experiencing any loss of system pressure.\n\nThe disadvantage of hermetic compressors is that the motor drive cannot be repaired or maintained, and the entire compressor must be replaced if a motor fails. A further disadvantage is that burnt-out windings can contaminate whole systems, thereby requiring the system to be entirely pumped down and the gas replaced (This can also happen in semi hermetic compressors where the motor operates in the refrigerant). Typically, hermetic compressors are used in low-cost factory-assembled consumer goods where the cost of repair and labor is high compared to the value of the device, and it would be more economical to just purchase a new device or compressor. Semi-hermetic compressors are used in mid-sized to large refrigeration and air conditioning systems, where it is cheaper to repair the compressor rather than buying and installing a new one. A hermetic compressor is simpler and cheaper to build than a semi-hermetic compressor.\n\nAn advantage of open compressors is that they can be driven by non-electric power sources, such as an [[internal combustion engine]] or [[turbine]]. However, open compressors that drive refrigeration systems are generally not totally ''maintenance-free'' throughout the life of the system, since some gas leakage will occur over time.\n\n==Thermodynamics of gas compression==\n\n===Isentropic compressor===\nA compressor can be idealized as internally reversible and [[adiabatic]], thus an [[isentropic]] steady state device, meaning the change in [[entropy]] is 0.<ref name=\"Cengel, Yunus A. 2012\">Cengel, Yunus A., and Michaeul A.

Real world cycles have inherent losses due to inefficient compressors and turbines. The real world system are not truly isentropic but are rather idealized as isentropic for calculation purposes.\n\n==Temperature==\n{{main article|Gas laws}}\nCompression of a gas increases its [[temperature]].\n: <math>W = \\int_{V_1}^{V_2} p dV = p_1 V_1^n \\int_{V_1}^{V_2} V^{-n} dV</math>\n\nwhere\n: <math>\\frac { p_2 }{ p_1 }\\ = \\left( \\frac{ V_1 } { V_2 }\\ \\right) ^ n</math>\nor\n: <math>p_1 V_1^n = p_2 V_2^n = p V^n</math>\nand\n: <math>p = \\frac {p_1 V_1^n}{V^n} </math>\n\nso\n: <math>W = \\frac {{p_1} {V_1^n}} {1-n}\\ ( {V_2^{1-n}} - {V_1^{1-n}} ) </math>\n\nin which ''p'' is pressure, ''V'' is volume, ''n'' takes different values for different compression processes (see below), and 1 & 2 refer to initial and final states.\n\n{{anchor|Adiabatic}}\n* [[Adiabatic process|Adiabatic]] - This model assumes that no energy (heat) is transferred to or from the gas during the compression, and all supplied work is added to the internal energy of the gas, resulting in increases of temperature and pressure. Theoretical temperature rise is:<ref>''Perry's Chemical Engineer's Handbook'' 8th edition\nPerry, Green, page 10-45 section 10-76</ref>\n: <math> T_2 = T_1 \\left(\\frac {p_2}{p_1}\\right)^{(\\kappa-1)/\\kappa} </math>\nwith ''T''<sub>1</sub> and ''T''<sub>2</sub> in degrees [[Rankine scale|Rankine]] or [[kelvin]]s, ''p''<sub>2</sub> and ''p''<sub>1</sub> being absolute pressures and <math>\\kappa = </math> [[Heat capacity ratio|ratio of specific heat]]s (approximately 1.4 for air).  The rise in air and temperature ratio means compression does not follow a simple pressure to volume ratio. This is less efficient, but quick. Adiabatic compression or expansion more closely model real life when a compressor has good insulation, a large gas volume, or a short time scale (i.e., a high power level). In practice there will always be a certain amount of heat flow out of the compressed gas. Thus, making a perfect adiabatic compressor would require perfect heat insulation of all parts of the machine. For example, even a bicycle tire pump's metal tube becomes hot as you compress the air to fill a tire.\nThe relation between temperature and compression ratio described above means that the value of <math>n</math> for an adiabatic process is <math>\\kappa</math> (the ratio of specific heats).\n\n{{anchor|Isothermal}}\n* [[Isothermal process|Isothermal]] - This model assumes that the compressed gas remains at a constant temperature throughout the compression or expansion process. In this cycle, internal energy is removed from the system as heat at the same rate that it is added by the mechanical work of compression. Isothermal compression or expansion more closely models real life when the compressor has a large heat exchanging surface, a small gas volume, or a long time scale (i.e., a small power level). Compressors that utilize inter-stage cooling between compression stages come closest to achieving perfect isothermal compression. However, with practical devices perfect isothermal compression is not attainable. For example, unless you have an infinite number of compression stages with corresponding intercoolers, you will never achieve perfect isothermal compression.\n\nFor an isothermal process, <math>n</math> is 1, so the value of the work integral for an isothermal process is:\n: <math>W = - {p_1} {V_1} \\ln \\left( \\frac {p_2} {p_1} \\right)</math>\n\nWhen evaluated, the isothermal work is found to be lower than the adiabatic work.\n\n{{anchor|Polytropic}}\n* [[Polytropic process|Polytropic]] - This model takes into account both a rise in temperature in the gas as well as some loss of energy (heat) to the compressor's components. This assumes that heat may enter or leave the system, and that input shaft work can appear as both increased pressure (usually useful work) and increased temperature above adiabatic (usually losses due to cycle efficiency). Compression efficiency is then the ratio of temperature rise at theoretical 100 percent (adiabatic) vs. actual (polytropic). Polytropic compression will use a value of <math>n</math> between 0 (a constant-pressure process) and infinity (a constant volume process). For the typical case where an effort is made to cool the gas compressed by an approximately adiabatic process, the value of <math>n</math> will be between 1 and <math>\\kappa</math>.\n\n==Staged compression==\nIn the case of centrifugal compressors, commercial designs currently do not exceed a compression ratio of more than 3.5 to 1 in any one stage (for a typical gas). Since compression raises the temperature, the compressed gas is to be cooled between stages making the compression less adiabatic and more isothermal. The inter-stage coolers typically result in some partial condensation that is removed in [[vapor-liquid separator]]s.\n\nIn the case of small reciprocating compressors, the compressor flywheel may drive a cooling fan that directs ambient air across the [[intercooler]] of a two or more stage compressor.\n\nBecause rotary screw compressors can make use of cooling lubricant to reduce the temperature rise from compression, they very often exceed a 9 to 1 compression ratio. For instance, in a typical diving compressor the air is compressed in three stages. If each stage has a compression ratio of 7 to 1, the compressor can output 343 times atmospheric pressure (7 \u00d7 7 \u00d7 7 = 343 [[atmosphere (unit)|atmosphere]]s). ({{convert|343|atm|MPa ksi|sigfig=3|abbr=on|lk=out|disp=or}})\n\n==Drive motors==\nThere are many options for the motor that powers the compressor:\n* Gas [[turbine]]s power the axial and centrifugal flow compressors that are part of [[jet engine]]s.\n* [[Steam turbine]]s or [[water turbine]]s are possible for large compressors.\n* [[Electric motor]]s are cheap and quiet for static compressors. Small motors suitable for domestic electrical supplies use [[Single-phase electric power|single-phase]] [[alternating current]]. Larger motors can only be used where an industrial electrical [[Three-phase electric power|three phase]] alternating current supply is available.\n* [[Diesel engine]]s or [[petrol engine]]s are suitable for portable compressors and support compressors. \n* In automobiles and other types of vehicles (including piston-powered airplanes, boats, trucks, etc.), diesel or gasoline engines power output can be increased by compressing the intake air, so that more fuel can be burned per cycle. These engines can power compressors using their own crankshaft power (this setup known as a [[supercharger]]), or, use their exhaust gas to drive a turbine connected to the compressor (this setup known as a [[turbocharger]]).\n\n==Applications==\nGas compressors are used in various applications where either higher pressures or lower volumes of gas are needed:\n* In [[pipeline transport]] of purified natural gas from the production site to the consumer, a compressor is driven by a gas turbine fueled by gas bled from the pipeline. Thus, no external power source is necessary.\n* Petroleum refineries, natural gas processing plants, petrochemical and chemical plants, and similar large industrial plants require compressing for intermediate and end-product gases.\n* [[Refrigeration]] and [[air conditioner]] equipment use compressors to move [[heat]] in [[refrigerant]] cycles (see ''[[vapor-compression refrigeration]]'').\n* Gas turbine systems compress the intake [[combustion]] air.\n* Small-volume purified or manufactured gases require compression to fill high pressure cylinders for [[medical]], [[welding]], and other uses.\n* Various industrial, manufacturing, and building processes require [[compressed air]] to power [[pneumatic tools]].\n* In the manufacturing and blow moulding of PET plastic bottles and containers.\n* Some aircraft require compressors to maintain [[cabin pressurization]] at altitude.\n* Some types of [[jet engine]]s\u2014such as [[turbojet]]s and [[turbofan]]s\u2014compress the air required for fuel combustion. The jet engine's [[turbine]]s power the combustion air compressor.\n* In [[SCUBA diving]], [[hyperbaric oxygen therapy]], and other life support devices, compressors put [[breathing gas]] into small volume containers, such as [[diving cylinder]]s.<ref name=evil>{{cite journal |title=Compressed breathing air \u2013 the potential for evil from within |vauthors=Millar IL, Mouldey PG |year=2008 |volume=38 |issue=2 |pages=145\u201351 |journal=Diving and Hyperbaric Medicine |publisher=[[South Pacific Underwater Medicine Society]] |url=http://archive.rubicon-foundation.org/7964 |accessdate=2009-02-28 |pmid=22692708 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101225063245/http://archive.rubicon-foundation.org/7964 |archivedate=2010-12-25 }}</ref><ref name=oxyhackers >{{cite book |author=Harlow, V |title=Oxygen Hacker's Companion |publisher=Airspeed Press |year=2002 |isbn=0-9678873-2-1}}</ref>\n* In [[surface supplied diving]], an air compressor frequently supplies low pressure air (10 to 20 bar) for breathing.\n* [[Submarine]]s use compressors to store air for later use in displacing water from buoyancy chambers to adjust depth.\n* [[Turbocharger]]s and [[supercharger]]s are compressors that increase [[internal combustion engine]] performance by increasing the mass flow of air inside the cylinder, so the engine can burn more fuel and hence produce more power.\n* [[Rail transport|Rail]] and heavy [[road transport]] vehicles use [[compressed air]] to operate [[Air brake (rail)|rail vehicle]] or [[Air brake (road vehicle)|road vehicle]] brakes\u2014and various other systems ([[door]]s, [[windscreen wiper]]s, [[engine]], [[gearbox]] control, etc.).\n* Service stations and auto repair shops use compressed air to fill pneumatic [[tire]]s and power pneumatic tools.\n* [[Fire piston]]s and [[heat pump]]s exist to heat air or other gasses, and compressing the gas is only a means to that end.\n* Rotary lobe compressors are often used to provide air in pneumatic conveying lines for powder or solids.

Adjoining the bridge is the Swan Inn and slight earthworks of [[Empress Matilda|Matilda]]'s Castle.\n\n==The bridges==\nThere are in fact three stone bridges at this point on the Thames, from south to north: '''Radcot Bridge''', the '''Canal Bridge''' and '''Pidnell Bridge'''. The first is nearest to Pidnell (a hamlet in Faringdon [[civil parish|parish]]) and the last is nearest to Radcot. Whilst originally built on the Thames, Radcot Bridge is now on a backwater since the construction, in 1787, of a new cut for the [[Thames and Severn Canal]]. The Canal Bridge was built at the same time.\n\nRadcot Bridge is often claimed as the \"oldest bridge on the Thames\",{{cite quote|date=December 2014}} having been built, with pointed arches of [[Taynton, Oxfordshire|Taynton]] stone, around 1200. The [[Cistercian]] [[monk]]s of St Mary at [[C\u00eeteaux]] in [[Normandy]] were granted land for the purpose by [[John of England|King John]]. Much of the structure was broken down during the [[Radcot Bridge (Battle)|battle]] which took place here in 19 December 1387 between troops loyal to [[Richard II of England|Richard II]], led by court favourite [[Robert de Vere]], and an army captained by [[Henry Bolingbroke]], Earl of Derby, (the future [[Henry IV of England|Henry IV]]). Radcot Bridge  was reconstructed in 1393. \nThe bridge was again severely damaged during the [[Wars of the Roses]], and was largely rebuilt as it appears today, with a flattened centre arch.\n\nRadcot Bridge became a toll bridge and its wharf was commercially important as the highest shipping point on the Thames, with the junction of the [[Thames and Severn Canal|Severn-Thames canal]] not far away at [[Lechlade]] ([[Gloucestershire]]).\n\nThe [[Thames Path]] crosses the bridges.\n\n==Matilda's Castle==\n''[[Time Team]]'', in a programme first broadcast on 15 February 2009, excavated Matilda's Castle in the summer of 2008. They found that visible earthworks near the Radcot bridge dated from the 17th-century [[English Civil War]], when Parliamentary forces built them to support cannon used to bombard Royalist forces garrisoned in Radcot House. Underneath some of these earthworks were remains of a square [[Normans|Norman]] [[keep]] dating from the time of the 12th-century [[The Anarchy|Anarchy]]. Evidence suggested the tower was pulled down a century after it was built. Its remains were further damaged by later constructions on the site.

As part of this activity the P.111 was built for the [[Air Ministry]] to [[List of Air Ministry Specifications|specification E.27/46]] by [[Boulton Paul Aircraft Ltd]] to investigate the possibilities of the [[delta wing|delta planform wing]].<ref name=\"Dicey p34\">Jones 1993, p.34.</ref>\n\nThe P.111 was designed as the smallest airframe which could couple an engine ([[Rolls-Royce Nene]]), an [[ejection seat]] ([[Martin-Baker]]), and a delta wing. The latter was aerodynamically thin and had a sweep angle of 45\u00b0.  Without tip extensions the wing was strongly cropped at about 75% of the full delta.  The aircraft could be flown with these wings or with one of two pairs of extensions, the larger ones making an almost perfect pointed delta shape.<ref name=\"Barnes\">{{Harvnb|Brew|1993|pages=293\u2013301}}</ref> These extensions allowed an investigation of the aerodynamic effects of the tip shapes of delta wings. Unlike its contemporary the [[Avro 707]], roll and attitude were both controlled by a pair of [[elevon]]s. The fin had an unswept trailing edge and its tip also could be removed and altered, though it seems it always flew with a very pointed tip.  The P.111 was fitted with one of the first fully powered control systems, hydraulically driven with electrical trim tabs. Because the Nene had a [[centrifugal compressor]], the P.111 had a rather tubby fuselage, with an oval nose intake. The inward-retracting undercarriage had a noticeably wide track and a tall nosewheel leg placed it at 17\u00b0 on the ground. The construction was all-metal with the exception of the wing extensions and the fin tip, which were of [[glass-reinforced plastic]].\n\n==Testing and evaluation==\nThe P.111 made its first flight on 10 October 1950, at [[Royal Aircraft Establishment]] [[Boscombe Down]] with [[Squadron Leader]] Bob Smyth at the controls. Later test flying was carried out by the legendary test pilot, [[Alexander E. Gunn (Pilot)|Alexander E. \"Ben\" Gunn]], who described the aeroplane as \"touchy\" and \"like flying a razor's edge\".<ref name=\"Dicey p38\">Jones 1993, p.38.</ref> Part of the touchiness was because the power controls, essential at high speeds over 450&nbsp;mph, lacked any feedback.  There was also a large trim change when the undercarriage was raised or lowered and landing speeds were high in the absence of airbrakes and because of the need to keep the engine revs up to maintain the generators which powered the control surfaces.<ref name=\"Barnes\"/> In the first few months of flying, the controls were spring-loaded to give a semblance of feel and the rudder was altered to manual control.  The P.111 initially had a one piece blown and continuously curved windscreen, but this was replaced by a more conventional framed screen with a flat forward pane.\n\nAfter a landing accident in which the retractable landing gear failed to extend, the P.111 was modified during its repairs to improve the flight characteristics,<ref name=\"Barnes\"/> and was re-designated the '''P.111A'''. Four \"petal\" airbrakes were added to the fuselage to lower landing speeds and the undercarriage doors were changed to reduce the trim change. A long nose probe carrying a pitot head was added. The most immediately obvious change was the new bright yellow overall paint scheme, the P.111 having been unpainted or silver coloured. The P.111A soon gained the nickname of the \"[[Yellow Peril]]\".\n\nThe P.111A first flew on 2 July 1953 from [[Boscombe Down]]. Shortly afterwards the anti-spin parachute mounted on the rear port fuselage was strengthened so it could be deployed as a braking parachute and the pilot was given control over the strength of the power controls.<ref name=\"Barnes\"/> It was used by the [[Royal Aircraft Establishment|RAE]] in a series of explorations of delta wing characteristics and later based at [[RAE Bedford]].  During this time it flew with each of the three wing tips.\n\nAfter a last flight in 1958 it went to the [[Cranfield University|Cranfield College of Aeronautics]] as a training airframe.<ref name=\"Dicey p39\">Jones 1993, p.39.</ref> In 1975 it was acquired by the Midland Aircraft Preservation Society on long-term loan for its Midland Air Museum at Coventry Airport, making the journey by road on Sunday 13 July, since when it has been on static public display.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.midlandairmuseum.co.uk/aircraft.php| title= Midland Air Museum| accessdate = 16 March 2007}}</ref> The P.111 was followed by another delta-winged experimental aircraft, the [[Boulton Paul P.120|P.120]] which was intended to compare and contrast the behaviour of an otherwise identical tailed delta.\n\n==Specifications (P.111)==\n[[File:p111a.jpg|thumb|''VT 935'', Profile of Boulton Paul P111A]]\n\n{{Aircraft specs\n|ref=Boulton Paul Aircraft since 1915<ref name=\"brewp301\">Brew 1993, p. 301.</ref>\n|prime units?=imp\n<!--\n        General characteristics\n-->\n\n|crew=1\n|length ft=26\n|length in=1\n|length note (without nose probe)\n|span m=\n|span ft=25\n|span in=8\n|span more ({{convert|29|ft|9|in|m|abbr=on}} or {{convert|33|ft|6|in|m|abbr=on}} with optional detachable wingtips)\n|height m=\n|height ft=12\n|height in=6\n|wing area sqm=\n|wing area sqft=269.25\n|wing area note=({{convert|284.16|sqft|m2|abbr=on}} or {{convert|290.13|sqft|m2|abbr=on}} with detachable wingtips)\n|empty weight kg=\n|empty weight lb=7517\n|gross weight kg=\n|gross weight lb=10127\n|fuel capacity=\n<!--\n        Powerplant\n-->\n|eng1 number=1\n|eng1 name=[[Rolls-Royce Nene]] 3 RN.2\n|eng1 type=[[turbojet]]\n|eng1 kn=<!-- jet/rocket engines -->\n|eng1 lbf=5100<!-- jet/rocket engines -->\n\n<!--\n        Performance\n-->\n|perfhide=\n\n|max speed kmh=\n|max speed mph=\n|max speed kts=564\n|max speed mach=at sea level\n|cruise speed kmh=<!-- if max speed unknown -->\n|cruise speed mph=<!-- if max speed unknown -->\n|cruise speed kts=\n|range km=\n|range miles=\n|range nmi=\n|ceiling m=\n|ceiling ft=\n|climb rate ms=\n|climb rate ftmin=9400\n|more performance=\n\n|avionics=\n}}\n\n==See also==\n{{aircontent\n|related=\n|similar aircraft=\n* [[Avro 707]]\n* [[Boulton Paul P.120]]\n* [[Convair XF-92]]\n* [[Handley Page HP.115]]\n|lists=\n* [[List of experimental aircraft]]\n}}\n\n==References==\n\n===Notes===\n{{Reflist}}\n\n===Bibliography===\n{{Refbegin}}\n* {{cite book |last=Brew |first=Alec. |title=Boulton Paul Aircraft since 1915 |location=London |publisher=Putnam |year=1993 |isbn=0-85177-860-7 |ref=harv}}\n* {{cite book | last = Buttler | first = Tony | title = British Secret Projects : Jet Fighters since 1950 |edition=2nd | location= Manchester | publisher = Crecy Publishing | year = 2017 | isbn = 978-1-910-80905-1}}\n* Jones, Barry. \"Boulton Paul's Dicey Deltas\".

Shortly afterwards the anti-spin parachute mounted on the rear port fuselage was strengthened so it could be deployed as a braking parachute and the pilot was given control over the strength of the power controls.<ref name=\"Barnes\"/> It was used by the [[Royal Aircraft Establishment|RAE]] in a series of explorations of delta wing characteristics and later based at [[RAE Bedford]].

Fussball-Club Schweinfurt 1905'' was founded on 5 May 1905 by a group of sports enthusiasts. The club's first chairman Pepi Popp designed the still unchanged FC 05 crest.<ref name=\"Schweinfurtf\u00fchrer History\"/> \n\nThe team played in the local leagues until beginning of the [[First World War]]. Back  then, the home games were held at [[Stadion am Hutrasen|Hutrasen]] south of river [[Main (river)|Main]], which later became the venue of local competitor [[VfR 07 Schweinfurt]]. In 1919, Schweinfurt 05 had to move to a new court near Ludwigsbr\u00fccke and became member of the tier-one [[Kreisliga Bayern|Kreisliga Nordbayern]], but relegated after its first season. The team attempted a merger with Turngemeinde Schweinfurt von 1848, which lasted from 1921 to 1923, before the two groups parted ways again and the football division became ''1. Fussball-Club Schweinfurt 1905, Verein f\u00fcr Leibes\u00fcbungen e.V.''<ref name=\"History\"/>\n\nWhile FC 05 did not reap the expected benefits from the brief union, it improved dramatically after re-establishing itself as an independent club. Membership grew significantly and a number of new sports departments were formed within the organization. The football team yielded its first fruits in 1927 by winning the Unterfranken Cup championship,<ref name=\"Schweinfurtf\u00fchrer History\">{{cite web|title=Geschichte des FC 05 Schweinfurt | trans-title=FC Schweinfurt 05 History|publisher=www.schweinfurtfuehrer.de | url=https://www.schweinfurtfuehrer.de/geschichte/geschichte-des-fc-05-schweinfurt/ |accessdate=26 July 2017|language=German}}</ref> and in 1931, when it became Kreisliga Unterfranken champion.<ref>{{cite web|title=Kreisliga Bayern 1931|trans-title=1931 Kreisliga Bayern|publisher=fussball-historie.de|url=http://www.fussball-historie.de/Sued/OstkreisII1931.html|accessdate=10 April 2020|language=German}}</ref>\n\n===Years of excellence: 1931\u20131963===\n[[File:Andreas Kupfer and Albin Kitzinger.jpg|thumb|280px|right|[[Andreas Kupfer]] (left) and [[Albin Kitzinger]]]]\n\nSchweinfurt 05 finally gained first class status again with its entry into the [[Bezirksliga Bayern]] in 1931. \nAfter introduction of the [[Gauliga]] system in 1933, the club became member of the top-flight [[Gauliga Bayern]]. \nSchweinfurt had a couple of successful seasons in this era, winning the Gauliga Bayern in [[1938\u201339 Gauliga Bayern|1939]] and [[1941\u201342 Gauliga Bayern|1942]], and qualifying for the [[List of German football champions|German football championship]] round.\n \nIn the German football championship [[1939 German football championship|1939]] competition, the team barely missed the semi-final qualification games after 3 wins in the group stage, where it defeated later [[1943 German football championship|1943]] and [[1944 German football championship|1944]] German champion [[Dresdner SC]] 1\u20130 in the first leg, but then lost to Dresden 0\u20131 in the deceisive away match.<ref name=\"Stumpf\">{{cite web|title=Ehemaliger 05-Torwart Hans Stumpf gestorben|trans-title=Former 05 goalkeeper Hans Stumpf passed|publisher=mainpost.de|url=https://www.mainpost.de/sport/schweinfurt/Ehemaliger-05-Torwart-Hans-Stumpf-gestorben;art795,5487291?wt_ref=https%3A%2F%2Fde.wikipedia.org%2F&wt_t=1585256396531|accessdate=26 March 2020|language=German}}</ref>\nThe club failed in the round of 16 of the [[1942 German football championship|1942]] German football championship after a 1\u20132 loss to [[SG SS Stra\u00dfburg]].\n\nSchweinfurt made a semi-final appearance in the [[1936 Tschammerpokal]], when it was defeated 2\u20133 by [[FC Schalke 04]], the closest it ever came to winning a national title.

FC 05 goalkeeper [[G\u00fcnter Bernard]] made two West Germany appearances in 1962, before he joined Bundesliga founding member [[SV Werder Bremen]] one year later, and was named in Germany's squad for the [[1966 FIFA World Cup]].\n\n===Second tier years: 1963\u20131976===\nAs it did not qualify for the newly established Bundesliga in 1963, Schweinfurt 05 found itself playing in the second tier [[Regionalliga S\u00fcd (1963\u20131974)|Regionalliga S\u00fcd]]. In the [[1965\u201366 Regionalliga|1965\u201366]] season, the club became Southern German champion and made it to the [[1965\u201366 Regionalliga#Bundesliga promotion round|Bundesliga advancement games]], but was unable to ascend to the top tier.\n\nWith the introduction of the [[2.

Schweinfurt 05 became a [[yo-yo club]] ascending and descending between tiers III and IV, with just a pair of brief 2. Bundesliga appearances in [[1990\u201391 2.

In the [[1989\u201390 DFB-Pokal|1989\u201390]] season the team made it into the last sixteen of the [[DFB-Pokal]], where it lost 0\u20132 to [[Eintracht Braunschweig]].\n\nDisasters happened in 2004 when FC Schweinfurt 05 was forced to leave the Regionalliga S\u00fcd (III) because of financial reasons, and in 2005 when the club went bankrupt. The results in the Bayernliga (IV) were annulled and the team was relegated to the fifth tier Landesliga.\n\nA re-structured club successfully worked its way back into Bayernliga in 2008. After it was relegated again to the Landesliga in 2009, the team returned to the Bayerliga immediately the following year. At the end of the [[2011\u201312 Bayernliga|2011\u201312]] season the club managed to qualify for the promotion round to the new [[Regionalliga Bayern]] (IV) and advanced to the second round, where the club missed out on promotion.<ref>{{cite web|title=Das war die Relegation 2012 auf Verbandsebene |publisher=www.fupa.net|url=http://www.fupa.net/berichte/so-laeuft-die-relegation-auf-verbandsebene-21714.html |accessdate=13 June 2017|language=German}}</ref>\n\nThe club finally earned direct promotion to tier-four Regionalliga Bayern in the [[2012\u201313 Bayernliga|2012\u201313]] season by taking the championship in the Bayernliga northern division.\nSchweinfurt's first three Regionalliga years, however, were characterized by a permanent struggle against relegation.\nFC Schweinfurt 05 finished the [[2013\u201314 Regionalliga#Regionalliga Bayern|2013\u201314]] Regionalliga with a relegation play-off rank only courtesy of a controversial final game of the season.

Fussball-Club Schweinfurt 1905'' was founded on 5 May 1905 by a group of sports enthusiasts. The club's first chairman Pepi Popp designed the still unchanged FC 05 crest. \n\nThe team played in the local leagues until beginning of the [[First World War]]. Back  then, the home games were held at [[Stadion am Hutrasen|Hutrasen]] south of river [[Main (river)|Main]], which later became the venue of local competitor [[VfR 07 Schweinfurt]]. In 1919, Schweinfurt 05 had to move to a new court near Ludwigsbr\u00fccke and became member of the tier-one [[Kreisliga Bayern|Kreisliga Nordbayern]], but relegated after its first season. The team attempted a merger with Turngemeinde Schweinfurt von 1848, which lasted from 1921 to 1923, before the two groups parted ways again and the football division became ''1. Fussball-Club Schweinfurt 1905, Verein f\u00fcr Leibes\u00fcbungen e.V.''<ref name=\"History\"/>\n\nWhile FC 05 did not reap the expected benefits from the brief union, it improved dramatically after re-establishing itself as an independent club. Membership grew significantly and a number of new sports departments were formed within the organization. The football team yielded its first fruits in 1927 by winning the Unterfranken Cup championship,<ref name=\"Schweinfurtf\u00fchrer History\">{{cite web|title=Geschichte des FC 05 Schweinfurt | trans-title=FC Schweinfurt 05 History|publisher=www.schweinfurtfuehrer.de | url=https://www.schweinfurtfuehrer.de/geschichte/geschichte-des-fc-05-schweinfurt/ |accessdate=26 July 2017|language=German}}</ref> and in 1931, when it became Kreisliga Unterfranken champion.<ref>{{cite web|title=Kreisliga Bayern 1931|trans-title=1931 Kreisliga Bayern|publisher=fussball-historie.de|url=http://www.fussball-historie.de/Sued/OstkreisII1931.html|accessdate=10 April 2020|language=German}}</ref>\n\n===Years of excellence: 1931\u20131963===\n[[File:Andreas Kupfer and Albin Kitzinger.jpg|thumb|280px|right|[[Andreas Kupfer]] (left) and [[Albin Kitzinger]]]]\n\nSchweinfurt 05 finally gained first class status again with its entry into the [[Bezirksliga Bayern]] in 1931. \nAfter introduction of the [[Gauliga]] system in 1933, the club became member of the top-flight [[Gauliga Bayern]]. \nSchweinfurt had a couple of successful seasons in this era, winning the Gauliga Bayern in [[1938\u201339 Gauliga Bayern|1939]] and [[1941\u201342 Gauliga Bayern|1942]], and qualifying for the [[List of German football champions|German football championship]] round.\n \nIn the German football championship [[1939 German football championship|1939]] competition, the team barely missed the semi-final qualification games after 3 wins in the group stage, where it defeated later [[1943 German football championship|1943]] and [[1944 German football championship|1944]] German champion [[Dresdner SC]] 1\u20130 in the first leg, but then lost to Dresden 0\u20131 in the deceisive away match.<ref name=\"Stumpf\">{{cite web|title=Ehemaliger 05-Torwart Hans Stumpf gestorben|trans-title=Former 05 goalkeeper Hans Stumpf passed|publisher=mainpost.de|url=https://www.mainpost.de/sport/schweinfurt/Ehemaliger-05-Torwart-Hans-Stumpf-gestorben;art795,5487291?wt_ref=https%3A%2F%2Fde.wikipedia.org%2F&wt_t=1585256396531|accessdate=26 March 2020|language=German}}</ref>\nThe club failed in the round of 16 of the [[1942 German football championship|1942]] German football championship after a 1\u20132 loss to [[SG SS Stra\u00dfburg]].\n\nSchweinfurt made a semi-final appearance in the [[1936 Tschammerpokal]], when it was defeated 2\u20133 by [[FC Schalke 04]], the closest it ever came to winning a national title.

Kitzinger and Kupfer were an essential part of the famous [[Breslau Eleven|Germany national team]] who defeated [[Denmark national football team|Denmark]] 8\u20130 in [[Wroc\u0142aw|Breslau]] ([[Poland]]) on 16 May 1937.<ref name=\"Wunderteam\"/> One year later they competed at the [[1938 FIFA World Cup]], and were both called up to represent Germany within the FIFA selection [[Europe XI]] in the [[The Football Association|FA]] 75th anniversary game against [[England national football team|England]] at [[Highbury Stadium|Highbury]] in [[London]].\n\nDue to the [[Second World War]], Schweinfurt 05 merged with Luftwaffen SV Schweinfurt into KSG Schweinfurt for the [[1943\u201344 Gauliga Bayern|1943\u201344]] and [[1944\u201345 Gauliga Bayern|1944\u201345]] Gauliga seasons.<ref>{{cite web|title=Gauligisten| trans-title=Gauliga clubs|publisher=www.deutscherfussball.info | url=https://www.deutscherfussball.info/Gauligisten-S-d--Sa_Se.htm |accessdate=24 August 2017}}</ref> The club temporarily had been dissolved in May 1945 under pressure from the occupying powers.<ref name=\"Schweinfurtf\u00fchrer History\"/>\n\nAfter World War II, the re-established 1.

FC 05 goalkeeper [[G\u00fcnter Bernard]] made two West Germany appearances in 1962, before he joined Bundesliga founding member [[SV Werder Bremen]] one year later, and was named in Germany's squad for the [[1966 FIFA World Cup]].\n\n===Second tier years: 1963\u20131976===\nAs it did not qualify for the newly established Bundesliga in 1963, Schweinfurt 05 found itself playing in the second tier [[Regionalliga S\u00fcd (1963\u20131974)|Regionalliga S\u00fcd]]. In the [[1965\u201366 Regionalliga|1965\u201366]] season, the club became Southern German champion and made it to the [[1965\u201366 Regionalliga#Bundesliga promotion round|Bundesliga advancement games]], but was unable to ascend to the top tier.\n\nWith the introduction of the [[2. Bundesliga]] in 1974, Schweinfurt was founding member of the [[2. Bundesliga S\u00fcd (1974\u201381)|southern division]] despite only finishing 15th in the last Regionalliga year. For its first 2. Bundesliga season in [[1974\u201375 2. Bundesliga|1974\u201375]], the club had signed-up former national team [[forward (association football)|striker]] and [[List of Bundesliga top scorers|Bundesliga top scorer]] [[Lothar Emmerich]]. The team earned an excellent third place and barely missed the advancement games for promotion to Bundesliga.\n\n===Yo-yo years: 1976\u20132016===\n[[File:Schweinfurt Performance Chart.png|280px|thumb|Historical chart of the 1. FC Schweinfurt 05 league performance after 1945]]\nAfter the 1974\u201375 season, FC 05 began to falter: poor results and financial problems saw the club descend first to the [[Bayernliga]] (III) and then, for the first time in 1983, to the [[Landesliga Bayern-Nord]] (IV). Schweinfurt 05 became a [[yo-yo club]] ascending and descending between tiers III and IV, with just a pair of brief 2. Bundesliga appearances in [[1990\u201391 2. Bundesliga|1990\u201391]] and in [[2001\u201302 2. Bundesliga|2001\u201302]]. In the [[1989\u201390 DFB-Pokal|1989\u201390]] season the team made it into the last sixteen of the [[DFB-Pokal]], where it lost 0\u20132 to [[Eintracht Braunschweig]].\n\nDisasters happened in 2004 when FC Schweinfurt 05 was forced to leave the Regionalliga S\u00fcd (III) because of financial reasons, and in 2005 when the club went bankrupt.
