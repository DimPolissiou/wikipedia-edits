A reactive [[tuberculin]] skin test is a contraindication to BCG. Someone with a positive tuberculin reaction is not given BCG, because the risk of severe local inflammation and scarring is high, not because of the common misconception that tuberculin reactors \"are already immune\" and therefore do not need BCG. People found to have reactive tuberculin skin tests should be screened for active tuberculosis. BCG is also contraindicated in certain people who have IL-12 receptor pathway defects.\n\nBCG is given as a single [[intradermal]] injection at the insertion of the [[Deltoid muscle|deltoid]]. If BCG is accidentally given [[Subcutaneous injection|subcutaneous]]ly, then a local abscess may form (a \"BCG-oma\") that can sometimes ulcerate, and may require treatment with [[antibiotics]] immediately, otherwise without treatment it could spread the infection causing severe damage to vital organs. An abscess is not always associated with incorrect administration, and it is one of the more common complications that can occur with the vaccination. Numerous medical studies on treatment of these abscesses with antibiotics have been done with varying results, but the consensus is once pus is aspirated and analysed, provided no unusual bacilli are present, the abscess will generally heal on its own in a matter of weeks.<ref>Nick Makwana and Andrew Riordan (2004), \"Is medical therapy effective in the treatment of BCG abscesses?\", Birmingham Heartlands Hospital {{cite web |url=http://www.bestbets.org/cgi-bin/bets.pl?record=00797 |title=BestBets: Is medical therapy effective in the treatment of BCG abscesses? |accessdate=2007-04-01 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070216053220/http://www.bestbets.org/cgi-bin/bets.pl?record=00797 |archivedate=2007-02-16 }}</ref>\n\nThe characteristic raised scar that BCG immunization leaves is often used as proof of prior immunization. This scar must be distinguished from that of [[smallpox vaccination]], which it may resemble.\n\n==Adverse effects==\nBCG immunization generally causes some pain and scarring at the site of injection.  The main adverse effects are [[keloid]]s&mdash;large, raised scars.  The insertion of deltoid is most frequently used because the local complication rate is smallest when that site is used. Nonetheless, the buttock is an alternative site of administration because it provides better cosmetic outcomes.\n\nBCG vaccine should be given intradermally. If given subcutaneously, it may induce local infection and spread to the regional lymph nodes, causing either suppurative and nonsuppurative lymphadenitis. Conservative management is usually adequate for nonsuppurative lymphadenitis. If suppuration occurs, it may need needle aspiration. For nonresolving suppuration, surgical excision may be required. Evidence for the treatment of these complications is scarce.<ref>{{Cite journal|title = Treating BCG-induced disease in children|journal = The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews|date = 2013-01-01|issn = 1469-493X|pmid = 23440826|pages = CD008300|volume = 1|issue = 1|doi = 10.1002/14651858.CD008300.pub2|first = Carlos A.|last = Cuello-Garc\u00eda|first2 = Giordano|last2 = P\u00e9rez-Gaxiola|first3 = Carlos|last3 = Jim\u00e9nez Guti\u00e9rrez|pmc = 6532703}}</ref>\n\nUncommonly, breast and gluteal abscesses can occur due to haematogenous and lymphangiomatous spread.

Sometimes the powder is sealed with vacuum in a glass ampoule. Such a glass ampoule has to be opened slowly to prevent the airflow from blowing out the powder. Then the powder has to be diluted with saline water before injecting.\n\n==History==\n[[File:BCG advert.jpg|thumb|French poster promoting the BCG vaccine]]\nThe history of BCG is tied to that of [[smallpox]].  [[Jean Antoine Villemin]] first recognized bovine tuberculosis in 1854 and transmitted it, and [[Robert Koch]] first distinguished ''Mycobacterium bovis'' from ''[[Mycobacterium tuberculosis]]''.  Following the success of [[vaccination]] in preventing smallpox, established during the 18th century, scientists thought to find a corollary in tuberculosis by drawing a parallel between bovine tuberculosis and [[cowpox]]:  it was hypothesized that infection with bovine tuberculosis might protect against infection with human tuberculosis.  In the late 19th century, clinical trials using ''M. bovis'' were conducted in Italy with disastrous results, because ''M. bovis'' was found to be just as virulent as ''M. tuberculosis''.\n\n[[Albert Calmette]], a French physician and bacteriologist, and his assistant and later colleague, [[Camille Gu\u00e9rin]], a veterinarian, were working at the [[Institut Pasteur de Lille]] ([[Lille]], France) in 1908.  Their work included subculturing virulent strains of the tuberculosis bacillus and testing different culture media. They noted a glycerin-bile-potato mixture grew bacilli that seemed less virulent, and changed the course of their research to see if repeated subculturing would produce a strain that was attenuated enough to be considered for use as a vaccine. The BCG strain was isolated after subculturing 239 times during 13 years from virulent strain on glycerine potato medium.  The research continued throughout World War I until 1919, when the now avirulent bacilli were unable to cause tuberculosis disease in research animals.  Calmette and Guerin transferred to the Paris [[Pasteur Institute]] in 1919.  The BCG vaccine was first used in humans in 1921.<ref>{{cite book |vauthors=Fine PE, Carneiro IA, Milstein JB, Clements CJ | title=Issues relating to the use of BCG in immunization programs | publisher=[[World Health Organization]] (WHO) | year=1999 | location=Geneva }}</ref>\n\nPublic acceptance was slow, and one disaster, in particular, did much to harm public acceptance of the vaccine. In the summer of 1930 in [[L\u00fcbeck]], 240 infants were vaccinated in the first 10 days of life; almost all developed tuberculosis and 72 infants died. It was subsequently discovered that the BCG administered there had been contaminated with a virulent strain that was being stored in the same incubator, which led to legal action against the manufacturers of the vaccine.<ref>{{cite book | author=Rosenthal SR. | title=BCG vaccination against tuberculosis | publisher=Little, Brown & Co. | location=Boston | year=1957 }}</ref>\n\n[[Dr. R.G. Ferguson]], working at the [[Fort San, Saskatchewan|Fort Qu'Appelle Sanatorium]] in Saskatchewan, was among the pioneers in developing the practice of vaccination against tuberculosis. In 1928, BCG was adopted by the Health Committee of the [[League of Nations]] (predecessor to the [[World Health Organization]] (WHO)).  Because of opposition, however, it only became widely used after World War II.  From 1945 to 1948, relief organizations (International Tuberculosis Campaign or Joint Enterprises) vaccinated over 8 million babies in [[eastern Europe]] and prevented the predicted typical increase of TB after a major war.\n\nBCG is very efficacious against [[tuberculous meningitis]] in the pediatric age group, but its efficacy against pulmonary tuberculosis appears to be variable. As of 2006, only a few countries do not use BCG for routine vaccination. Two countries that have never used it routinely are the United States and the Netherlands (in both countries, it is felt that having a reliable [[Mantoux test]] and therefore being able to accurately detect active disease is more beneficial to society than vaccinating against a condition that is now relatively rare there).<ref>{{cite web

A reactive [[tuberculin]] skin test is a contraindication to BCG. Someone with a positive tuberculin reaction is not given BCG, because the risk of severe local inflammation and scarring is high, not because of the common misconception that tuberculin reactors \"are already immune\" and therefore do not need BCG. People found to have reactive tuberculin skin tests should be screened for active tuberculosis. BCG is also contraindicated in certain people who have IL-12 receptor pathway defects.\n\nBCG is given as a single [[intradermal]] injection at the insertion of the [[Deltoid muscle|deltoid]]. If BCG is accidentally given [[Subcutaneous injection|subcutaneous]]ly, then a local abscess may form (a \"BCG-oma\") that can sometimes ulcerate, and may require treatment with [[antibiotics]] immediately, otherwise without treatment it could spread the infection causing severe damage to vital organs. An abscess is not always associated with incorrect administration, and it is one of the more common complications that can occur with the vaccination. Numerous medical studies on treatment of these abscesses with antibiotics have been done with varying results, but the consensus is once pus is aspirated and analysed, provided no unusual bacilli are present, the abscess will generally heal on its own in a matter of weeks.<ref>Nick Makwana and Andrew Riordan (2004), \"Is medical therapy effective in the treatment of BCG abscesses?\", Birmingham Heartlands Hospital {{cite web |url=http://www.bestbets.org/cgi-bin/bets.pl?record=00797 |title=BestBets: Is medical therapy effective in the treatment of BCG abscesses? |accessdate=2007-04-01 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070216053220/http://www.bestbets.org/cgi-bin/bets.pl?record=00797 |archivedate=2007-02-16 }}</ref>\n\nThe characteristic raised scar that BCG immunization leaves is often used as proof of prior immunization. This scar must be distinguished from that of [[smallpox vaccination]], which it may resemble.\n\n==Adverse effects==\nBCG immunization generally causes some pain and scarring at the site of injection.  The main adverse effects are [[keloid]]s&mdash;large, raised scars.  The insertion of deltoid is most frequently used because the local complication rate is smallest when that site is used. Nonetheless, the buttock is an alternative site of administration because it provides better cosmetic outcomes.\n\nBCG vaccine should be given intradermally. If given subcutaneously, it may induce local infection and spread to the regional lymph nodes, causing either suppurative and nonsuppurative lymphadenitis. Conservative management is usually adequate for nonsuppurative lymphadenitis. If suppuration occurs, it may need needle aspiration. For nonresolving suppuration, surgical excision may be required. Evidence for the treatment of these complications is scarce.<ref>{{Cite journal|title = Treating BCG-induced disease in children|journal = The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews|date = 2013-01-01|issn = 1469-493X|pmid = 23440826|pages = CD008300|volume = 1|issue = 1|doi = 10.1002/14651858.CD008300.pub2|first = Carlos A.|last = Cuello-Garc\u00eda|first2 = Giordano|last2 = P\u00e9rez-Gaxiola|first3 = Carlos|last3 = Jim\u00e9nez Guti\u00e9rrez|pmc = 6532703}}</ref>\n\nUncommonly, breast and gluteal abscesses can occur due to haematogenous and lymphangiomatous spread.

Sometimes the powder is sealed with vacuum in a glass ampoule. Such a glass ampoule has to be opened slowly to prevent the airflow from blowing out the powder. Then the powder has to be diluted with saline water before injecting.\n\n==History==\n[[File:BCG advert.jpg|thumb|French poster promoting the BCG vaccine]]\nThe history of BCG is tied to that of [[smallpox]].  [[Jean Antoine Villemin]] first recognized bovine tuberculosis in 1854 and transmitted it, and [[Robert Koch]] first distinguished ''Mycobacterium bovis'' from ''[[Mycobacterium tuberculosis]]''.  Following the success of [[vaccination]] in preventing smallpox, established during the 18th century, scientists thought to find a corollary in tuberculosis by drawing a parallel between bovine tuberculosis and [[cowpox]]:  it was hypothesized that infection with bovine tuberculosis might protect against infection with human tuberculosis.  In the late 19th century, clinical trials using ''M. bovis'' were conducted in Italy with disastrous results, because ''M. bovis'' was found to be just as virulent as ''M. tuberculosis''.\n\n[[Albert Calmette]], a French physician and bacteriologist, and his assistant and later colleague, [[Camille Gu\u00e9rin]], a veterinarian, were working at the [[Institut Pasteur de Lille]] ([[Lille]], France) in 1908.  Their work included subculturing virulent strains of the tuberculosis bacillus and testing different culture media. They noted a glycerin-bile-potato mixture grew bacilli that seemed less virulent, and changed the course of their research to see if repeated subculturing would produce a strain that was attenuated enough to be considered for use as a vaccine. The BCG strain was isolated after subculturing 239 times during 13 years from virulent strain on glycerine potato medium.  The research continued throughout World War I until 1919, when the now avirulent bacilli were unable to cause tuberculosis disease in research animals.  Calmette and Guerin transferred to the Paris [[Pasteur Institute]] in 1919.  The BCG vaccine was first used in humans in 1921.<ref>{{cite book |vauthors=Fine PE, Carneiro IA, Milstein JB, Clements CJ | title=Issues relating to the use of BCG in immunization programs | publisher=[[World Health Organization]] (WHO) | year=1999 | location=Geneva }}</ref>\n\nPublic acceptance was slow, and one disaster, in particular, did much to harm public acceptance of the vaccine. In the summer of 1930 in [[L\u00fcbeck]], 240 infants were vaccinated in the first 10 days of life; almost all developed tuberculosis and 72 infants died. It was subsequently discovered that the BCG administered there had been contaminated with a virulent strain that was being stored in the same incubator, which led to legal action against the manufacturers of the vaccine.<ref>{{cite book | author=Rosenthal SR. | title=BCG vaccination against tuberculosis | publisher=Little, Brown & Co. | location=Boston | year=1957 }}</ref>\n\n[[Dr. R.G. Ferguson]], working at the [[Fort San, Saskatchewan|Fort Qu'Appelle Sanatorium]] in Saskatchewan, was among the pioneers in developing the practice of vaccination against tuberculosis. In 1928, BCG was adopted by the Health Committee of the [[League of Nations]] (predecessor to the [[World Health Organization]] (WHO)).  Because of opposition, however, it only became widely used after World War II.  From 1945 to 1948, relief organizations (International Tuberculosis Campaign or Joint Enterprises) vaccinated over 8 million babies in [[eastern Europe]] and prevented the predicted typical increase of TB after a major war.\n\nBCG is very efficacious against [[tuberculous meningitis]] in the pediatric age group, but its efficacy against pulmonary tuberculosis appears to be variable. As of 2006, only a few countries do not use BCG for routine vaccination. Two countries that have never used it routinely are the United States and the Netherlands (in both countries, it is felt that having a reliable [[Mantoux test]] and therefore being able to accurately detect active disease is more beneficial to society than vaccinating against a condition that is now relatively rare there).<ref>{{cite web

The Sparklers issued an album, ''Persuasion'', in October 1988 with Oxley writing all tracks except one co-written with Abrahams.<ref name=\"NLAPersuasion\"/>\n{{quote|after my brothers' band [The Sunnboys] split up, my brother Peter and I started the Sparklers with Chris, although he left before that album [''Persuasion''] was made.|Melanie Oxley|<ref name=\"Dwyer\"/>}}\n\n''Persuasion'' was produced by Leszek Karski on Mighty Boys Records before the group disbanded in 1989.<ref name=\"McFarlane\"/> Oxley also performed backing vocals for [[Johanna Pigott]]'s band [[Scribble (band)|Scribble]], appearing on their 1986 album ''Pop Art'', as well as on [[Ed Kuepper]]'s 1986 album ''[[Rooms of the Magnificent]]''.<ref name=\"Holmgren\"/><ref name=\"Rooms\"/> Other 1980s work includes The Spliffs ''House of Seven'' (1988) and Penguins on Safari's ''Normal Soon'' (1989).<ref name=\"Holmgren\"/>\n\nIn 1989 Oxley formed a soul pop duo, Melanie Oxley & Chris Abrahams, with ex-The Sparklers bandmate, Abrahams (by then also a pianist-songwriter for experimental jazz trio, [[The Necks]]).<ref name=\"McFarlane\"/> She worked periodically with Abrahams, performing, writing songs and recording albums, while maintaining a career as a primary school teacher. In December 1990 the duo released a four-track EP, ''Resisting Calm'', on Spiral Scratch Records.<ref name=\"McFarlane\"/><ref name=\"NLAResisting\"/> For the EP they used Tony Buck on drums, Mike Bukovsky on trumpet, Gerard Corben (ex-The Sparklers) on guitar, Guy Dickerson on guitar, Stuart Eadie on [[floor tom]]s, [[Jackie Orszaczky]] on bass guitar and Lloyd Swanton on acoustic bass.<ref name=\"Resisting\"/> It was co-produced by Abrahams and Oxley.<ref name=\"Resisting\"/> National radio station, [[Triple J]], placed the track, \"Benchtop\", on high rotation \u2013 a live version appeared on the compilation album, ''[[Live at the Wireless#Live at the Wireless 2|Live at the Wireless 2]]'' (1991).<ref name=\"Live2\"/> Their debut studio album, ''Welcome to Violet'', followed in October 1992 on [[Remote Control Records]], which exemplified their \"moody, emotive soul/pop\" sound.<ref name=\"McFarlane\"/><ref name=\"NLAWelcome\"/> At the [[ARIA Music Awards of 1993]], ''Welcome to Violet'' was nominated for Best Independent Release.<ref name=\"ARIA1993\"/> On 3 October 1994, their second studio album, ''Coal'', appeared.\n\nTheir third studio album, ''Jerusalem Bay'', was issued in December 1998 and was produced by Oxley and Abrahams.<ref name=\"McFarlane\"/><ref name=\"NLAJerusalem\"/> Additional musicians included [[Miroslav Bukovsky|Mike Bukowski]] on trumpet (ex-Ten Part Invention) and Hamish Stuart on drums ([[Ayers Rock (band)|Ayers Rock]], Wig World, Catholics).<ref name=\"McFarlane\"/><ref name=\"NLAJerusalem\"/> The album includes a cover version of \"[[Cry Me a River (1953 song)|Cry Me a River]]\" written by [[Arthur Hamilton]].<ref name=\"NLAJerusalem\"/> ''Blood Oranges'' the fourth studio album was released in April 2003 on [[Vitamin Records]]. ''[[The Age]]''{{'}}s Michael Dwyer described their sound as \"sophisticated, sometimes jazz-tinted pop\" while Oxley feels \"It's quite a different album to ''Jerusalem Bay'', and it was recorded differently. That one was much more organic and live. With ''Blood Oranges'', Chris did a lot of work before we went into the studio, quite a lot of programming\".<ref name=\"Dwyer\"/> Session musicians included Stuart, [[Michael Sheridan (musician)|Michael Sheridan]] on guitar and [[Jonathan Zwartz]] on bass guitar. Vitamin Records promoted the album as being \"Coloured by a strange, at times, dark playfulness, [it] is dotted throughout with classic sounding songs drawn from a number of pop influences. Lyrically thoughtful, deceptively simple\".<ref name=\"AMOBlood\"/>\n\nIn April 2003 ''[[Sydney Morning Herald]]''{{'s}} John Shand reviewed their performance at The Basement, he found Oxley used \"a lot of breath aerating [her] lovely voice.

Chan School of Public Health|Harvard]] in 2000.<ref name=\"Gibbs2014\"/>  In 2000 Horvath joined the faculty of the [[University of California| University of California, Los Angeles]], where he is a Professor of [[human genetics]] at the David Geffen School of Medicine at [[UCLA]] and of [[biostatistics]] at the [[UCLA]] Fielding School of Public Health.<ref name=\"Gibbs2014\"/>\n\n== Work on the epigenetic clock ==\nHorvath's development of the [[DNA methylation]] based age estimation method known as [[epigenetic clock]]  was featured in Nature magazine.<ref name=\"Gibbs2014\"/>\nIn 2011 Horvath co-authored the first article that described an age estimation method based on DNA methylation levels from saliva.<ref name=\"Bocklandt2011\"/> In 2013 Horvath published a single author article on a multi-tissue age estimation method that applies to all nucleated cells, tissues, and organs.<ref name=\"Horvath2013\"/><ref name=\"Gibbs2014\"/> This discovery, known as the [[Epigenetic clock|Horvath clock]], was unexpected because cell types differ in terms of their DNA methylation patterns and age related DNA methylation changes tend to be tissue specific.<ref name=\"Gibbs2014\"/> In his article, he demonstrated that estimated age, also referred to as DNA methylation age, has the following properties: it is close to zero for embryonic and [[induced pluripotent stem cell]]s, it correlates with cell [[Subculture (biology)#Passage number|passage number]]; it gives rise to a highly heritable measure of age acceleration; and it is applicable to chimpanzees.<ref name=\"Horvath2013\"/> \nSince the Horvath clock allows one to contrast the ages of different tissues from the same individuals, it can be used to identify tissues that show evidence of increased or decreased age.<ref name=\"Horvath2015cerebellum\"/>\n\n===Age related conditions and phenotypes===\nHorvath co-authored the first articles demonstrating that DNA methylation age predicts life-expectancy <ref name=\"Marioni2015mortality\"/><ref name=\"Horvath2015centenarian\"/><ref name=\"Chen2016\"/> and is positively associated with [[obesity]],<ref name=\"Horvath2014obesity\"/> [[HIV]] infection,<ref name=\"Horvath2015HIV\"/> [[Alzheimer's disease]],<ref name=\"Levine2015\"/> cognitive decline,<ref name=\"Marioni2015fitness\"/> [[Parkinson's disease]],<ref name=\"Horvath2015Parkinson\">{{cite journal | last1 = Horvath | first1 = S | year = 2015 | title = Increased epigenetic age and granulocyte counts in the blood of Parkinson's disease patients.| url = http://www.impactaging.com/papers/v7/n12/full/100859.html| journal = Aging | volume=7| issue =12| pages =  1130\u201342| doi = 10.18632/aging.100859| pmid= 26655927 | pmc=4712337}}</ref> [[Huntington's disease]],<ref name=\"Horvath2016HD\"/> early [[menopause]],<ref name=\"Levine2016menopause\"/> and [[Werner syndrome]].<ref name=\"Maierhofer2017Werner\"/>\n\n===Genetics of aging===\nHorvath published the first article demonstrating that trisomy 21 ([[Down syndrome]]) is associated with strong epigenetic age acceleration effects in both blood and brain tissue.<ref name=\"Horvath2015DownSyndrome\"/> \nUsing [[Genome-wide association study|genome-wide association studies]], Horvath's team identified the first genetic markers (SNPs) that exhibit genome-wide significant associations with epigenetic aging rates.<ref name=\"Lu2016\"/><ref name=\"Lu2017\"/>\nIn particular, the first genome-wide significant genetic loci associated with epigenetic aging rates in blood notably the telomerase reverse transcriptase gene ([[Telomerase reverse transcriptase|TERT]]) locus.<ref name=\"LuGWAS2018\">{{cite journal |last1=Lu |first1=Ake T. |last2=Xue |first2=Luting |last3=Salfati |first3=Elias L. |last4=Chen |first4=Brian H. |last5=Ferrucci |first5=Luigi |last6=Levy |first6=Daniel |last7=Joehanes |first7=Roby |last8=Murabito |first8=Joanne M. |last9=Kiel |first9=Douglas P. |last10=Tsai |first10=Pei-Chien |last11=Yet |first11=Idil |last12=Bell |first12=Jordana T. |last13=Mangino |first13=Massimo |last14=Tanaka |first14=Toshiko |last15=McRae |first15=Allan F. |last16=Marioni |first16=Riccardo E. |last17=Visscher |first17=Peter M. |last18=Wray |first18=Naomi R. |last19=Deary |first19=Ian J. |last20=Levine |first20=Morgan E. |last21=Quach |first21=Austin |last22=Assimes |first22=Themistocles |last23=Tsao |first23=Philip S. |last24=Absher |first24=Devin |last25=Stewart |first25=James D. |last26=Li |first26=Yun |last27=Reiner |first27=Alex P. |last28=Hou |first28=Lifang |last29=Baccarelli |first29=Andrea A. |last30=Whitsel |first30=Eric A. |last31=Aviv |first31=Abraham |last32=Cardona |first32=Alexia |last33=Day |first33=Felix R. |last34=Wareham |first34=Nicholas J. |last35=Perry |first35=John R.

He is a professor at the [[University of California Los Angeles]] known for developing the [[Epigenetic clock|Horvath aging clock]], which is a highly accurate molecular [[Biomarkers of aging|biomarker of aging]], and for developing [[weighted correlation network analysis]].\nThe recipient of several research awards he has studied [[Biomarkers of aging|genomic biomarkers of aging]], the [[senescence|aging process]], and many age related diseases/conditions.\n[[File:Steve Horvath, UCLA professor, presenting a talk June 2015.jpg|thumb|Steve Horvath, UCLA professor, presenting a talk June 2015]]\n\n== Background ==\nHorvath was born in [[Frankfurt]], [[Germany]].<ref name=\"Gibbs2014\"/> He received his [[Doctor of Philosophy|Ph.D.]] in mathematics at the [[University of North Carolina]] in 1995 and his [[Doctor of Science|Sc.D.]] in biostatistics at [[Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health|Harvard]] in 2000.<ref name=\"Gibbs2014\"/>  In 2000 Horvath joined the faculty of the [[University of California| University of California, Los Angeles]], where he is a Professor of [[human genetics]] at the David Geffen School of Medicine at [[UCLA]] and of [[biostatistics]] at the [[UCLA]] Fielding School of Public Health.<ref name=\"Gibbs2014\"/>\n\n== Work on the epigenetic clock ==\nHorvath's development of the [[DNA methylation]] based age estimation method known as [[epigenetic clock]]  was featured in Nature magazine.<ref name=\"Gibbs2014\"/>\nIn 2011 Horvath co-authored the first article that described an age estimation method based on DNA methylation levels from saliva.<ref name=\"Bocklandt2011\"/> In 2013 Horvath published a single author article on a multi-tissue age estimation method that applies to all nucleated cells, tissues, and organs.<ref name=\"Horvath2013\"/><ref name=\"Gibbs2014\"/> This discovery, known as the [[Epigenetic clock|Horvath clock]], was unexpected because cell types differ in terms of their DNA methylation patterns and age related DNA methylation changes tend to be tissue specific.<ref name=\"Gibbs2014\"/> In his article, he demonstrated that estimated age, also referred to as DNA methylation age, has the following properties: it is close to zero for embryonic and [[induced pluripotent stem cell]]s, it correlates with cell [[Subculture (biology)#Passage number|passage number]]; it gives rise to a highly heritable measure of age acceleration; and it is applicable to chimpanzees.<ref name=\"Horvath2013\"/> \nSince the Horvath clock allows one to contrast the ages of different tissues from the same individuals, it can be used to identify tissues that show evidence of increased or decreased age.<ref name=\"Horvath2015cerebellum\"/>\n\n===Age related conditions and phenotypes===\nHorvath co-authored the first articles demonstrating that DNA methylation age predicts life-expectancy <ref name=\"Marioni2015mortality\"/><ref name=\"Horvath2015centenarian\"/><ref name=\"Chen2016\"/> and is positively associated with [[obesity]],<ref name=\"Horvath2014obesity\"/> [[HIV]] infection,<ref name=\"Horvath2015HIV\"/> [[Alzheimer's disease]],<ref name=\"Levine2015\"/> cognitive decline,<ref name=\"Marioni2015fitness\"/> [[Parkinson's disease]],<ref name=\"Horvath2015Parkinson\">{{cite journal | last1 = Horvath | first1 = S | year = 2015 | title = Increased epigenetic age and granulocyte counts in the blood of Parkinson's disease patients.| url = http://www.impactaging.com/papers/v7/n12/full/100859.html| journal = Aging | volume=7| issue =12| pages =  1130\u201342| doi = 10.18632/aging.100859| pmid= 26655927 | pmc=4712337}}</ref> [[Huntington's disease]],<ref name=\"Horvath2016HD\"/> early [[menopause]],<ref name=\"Levine2016menopause\"/> and [[Werner syndrome]].<ref name=\"Maierhofer2017Werner\"/>\n\n===Genetics of aging===\nHorvath published the first article demonstrating that trisomy 21 ([[Down syndrome]]) is associated with strong epigenetic age acceleration effects in both blood and brain tissue.<ref name=\"Horvath2015DownSyndrome\"/> \nUsing [[Genome-wide association study|genome-wide association studies]], Horvath's team identified the first genetic markers (SNPs) that exhibit genome-wide significant associations with epigenetic aging rates.<ref name=\"Lu2016\"/><ref name=\"Lu2017\"/>\nIn particular, the first genome-wide significant genetic loci associated with epigenetic aging rates in blood notably the telomerase reverse transcriptase gene ([[Telomerase reverse transcriptase|TERT]]) locus.<ref name=\"LuGWAS2018\">{{cite journal |last1=Lu |first1=Ake T. |last2=Xue |first2=Luting |last3=Salfati |first3=Elias L. |last4=Chen |first4=Brian H. |last5=Ferrucci |first5=Luigi |last6=Levy |first6=Daniel |last7=Joehanes |first7=Roby |last8=Murabito |first8=Joanne M. |last9=Kiel |first9=Douglas P. |last10=Tsai |first10=Pei-Chien |last11=Yet |first11=Idil |last12=Bell |first12=Jordana T. |last13=Mangino |first13=Massimo |last14=Tanaka |first14=Toshiko |last15=McRae |first15=Allan F. |last16=Marioni |first16=Riccardo E. |last17=Visscher |first17=Peter M. |last18=Wray |first18=Naomi R. |last19=Deary |first19=Ian J. |last20=Levine |first20=Morgan E. |last21=Quach |first21=Austin |last22=Assimes |first22=Themistocles |last23=Tsao |first23=Philip S. |last24=Absher |first24=Devin |last25=Stewart |first25=James D. |last26=Li |first26=Yun |last27=Reiner |first27=Alex P. |last28=Hou |first28=Lifang |last29=Baccarelli |first29=Andrea A. |last30=Whitsel |first30=Eric A. |last31=Aviv |first31=Abraham |last32=Cardona |first32=Alexia |last33=Day |first33=Felix R. |last34=Wareham |first34=Nicholas J. |last35=Perry |first35=John R.
