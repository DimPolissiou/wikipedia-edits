In the 19th century, it became the \"[[Mother of Fraternities]]\",<ref name=somers304>Somers (2003), p. 304</ref> as three of the earliest [[Fraternities and sororities in North America|such organizations]] were established there.  After 175 years as a traditional all-male institution, Union College began enrolling women in 1970.\n\nThe college offers a [[liberal arts]] curriculum across some 21 academic departments, as well as opportunities for interdepartmental [[Academic major|major]]s and self-designed organizing theme majors. In common with most liberal arts colleges, Union offers a wide array of courses in arts, sciences, literature, and foreign languages, but, in common with only a few other liberal arts colleges, Union also offers [[ABET|ABET-accredited]] undergraduate degrees in [[computer engineering]], [[bioengineering]], [[electrical engineering]], and [[mechanical engineering]]. By the time they graduate, about 60% of Union students will have engaged in some form of international study or [[study abroad]].<ref>{{cite web |title=Union College Office of Institutional Studies |url=http://www.union.edu/Resources/Campus/institutional_studies/index.php |accessdate=2009-09-21|year=2008}}</ref>\n{{TOC limit}}\n\n==History==\n\n===Founding===\n[[File:Union1795nocap.jpg|thumb|border|left|The Schenectady Academy (Old Union College), 1795]]\n\nChartered in 1795,<ref name=fortenbaugh3>Fortenbaugh (1978), p. 3</ref> Union was one the first [[non-denominational]] institutions of [[higher education]] in the United States, and the second college established in the [[State of New York]].\n\nFrom 1636 to 1769, only nine institutions of [[higher education]] were founded on a permanent basis in [[Colonial America]].{{Ref label|a|a|none}} Most had been founded in association with British religious denominations devoted to the perpetuation of their respective Christian denominations.,<ref name=\"Tewksbury 1932, p. 59\">Tewksbury (1932), p. 59</ref> Union College was to be founded with a broader ecumenical basis.\n\nOnly [[Columbia University]] (the successor of King's College, founded in 1754),<ref>{{cite book |  year = 1902 | title = A History of Columbia University, 1754\u20131904 | publisher = Columbia University Press | location = New York | page = 1}}</ref> had preceded Union in New York. Twenty-five years later impetus for another institution grew.  Certain that [[General (United Kingdom)|General]] [[John Burgoyne]]'s defeat at the [[Battle of Saratoga]] in 1777 would mean a new nation, nearly 1,000 citizens of [[upstate New York|northern New York]] (which then included what eventually became [[Vermont]]) began the first popular demand for higher education in America.<ref name=fox10>Fox (1945), p. 10</ref> As a democratic cultural changes rose and began to become dominant<ref name=rudoloph34>Rudolph (1965), p. 34</ref> old ways, in particular the old purposes and structure of higher education, were being pushed aside.<ref name=boorstin153>Boorstin (1965), p. 153</ref>\n\n[[Schenectady]], originally a Mohawk outpost, was a city founded and dominated by people originating from the [[Netherlands]], with about 4,000 residents,<ref name=\"Somers 2003, p. 296\">Somers (2003), p. 296</ref>. It was the third largest city in the state, after [[Albany, New York|Albany]] and [[New York City]]. The [[Dutch Reformed Church]], began to show an interest in establishing an academy or college under its control there. In 1778, the Schenectady Dutch Reformed Church invited the Rev.

By at least 1792 it offered a full four-year college course, as well as one of elementary and practical subjects taught mainly to girls.<ref name=somers629>Somers (2003), p. 629</ref> Attempts to charter the Academy as a college with the [[University of the State of New York|Board of Regents of the University of the State of New York]] in 1786, 1792, and 1793 were rejected<ref name=\"Somers 2003, p. 296\"/> on the grounds the school was not yet either academically or financially qualified.<ref name=hough146>Hough (1885), p. 146</ref>\n\nThe following year the school reapplied, as \"Union College\", a name chosen to reflect the resolution that the school should be free of any specific religious affiliation.<ref name=raymond1:34>Raymond (1907), p. 1:34</ref>  The resulting institution was awarded its charter on February 25, 1795 &ndash; still celebrated by the College as \"Founders' Day\".<ref name=yates423>Yates (1902), p. 423</ref>\n\n===Seals and mottos===\n[[File:SealUnionUniversity.jpg|thumb|The Seal of [[Union University (New York)|Union University]] on the Exterior Wall of the [[University Club of New York]] in Manhattan]]\n[[File:Minervaliberty.jpg|thumb|''[[Minerva]] as the Patroness of American Liberty'' (1791) by [[Giuseppe Ceracchi]]]]\n\nThe College's charter provided for the design of an official [[Seal (impression)|seal]] to be used on [[diploma]]s and other official business documents and correspondence. The Trustees were also authorized to select the \"devices and inscription\" to be engraved on the seal.<ref name=raymond1:38>Raymond (1907), p. 1:38</ref>  A committee of four Trustees was appointed to look into the matter, and a seal was approved in November 1796. The original seal and its press have been lost, but it is known that it was nearly identical to the seal in use today (from an impression on a document from 1796).<ref name=fortenbaugh74>Fortenbaugh (1978), p. 74</ref>\n\nThe Union College seal combines ancient and modern elements in balanced proportions. The head of the [[Roman goddess]] [[Minerva]] ([[Greek goddess]] [[Athena]]) appears in the center of an oval with an outside star pattern surrounding the whole.  Around the central figure are the [[French language|French]] words ''\"Sous les lois de Minerve nous devenons tous fr\u00e8res et s\u0153urs\"'' ({{lang-en|Under the laws of Minerva, we all become brothers and sisters}}).<ref name=fortenbaugh73>Fortenbaugh (1978), p. 73</ref>  Originally, the motto ended with the [[French language|French]] word ''\"fr\u00e8res\"'' ({{lang-en|brothers}}), but in 2015 the College modified the motto to add the [[French language|French]] words ''\"et s\u0153urs\"'' ({{lang-en|and sisters}}).<ref name=sisters>{{cite web|title= Union's age-old motto gets a modern makeover|url=https://www.union.edu/news/stories/2015/11/unions-age-old-motto-gets-a-modern-makeover.php|accessdate=23 July 2018}}</ref> On a banner just above the central figure are the words ''\"St: of N: York\"'' and on a similar banner below the central figure appear the words: ''\"Union College 1795\"''. The precise origins of the motto and the choice of Minerva as the fundamental element of the College seal are obscure, but two things are certain: like most colleges of the time, Union was deeply rooted in the classical tradition, but, unlike most colleges, Union chose a modern language rather than [[Latin]] for its motto. The resulting tone of the entire seal is thus historically aware, but distinctly modern in outlook.<ref name=somers636>Somers (2003), p. 636; See also Fortenbaugh, ''passim''.</ref>\n\nIt is not at all surprising that the original trustees should have chosen Minerva as their herald and representative. Minerva began her mythological career as a local Italian deity ([[Etruscan mythology|Etruscan]], but possibly with Greek influences), patroness of the arts and crafts.<ref name=altheim265>Altheim (1938), p. 265</ref>  By the time she was well established as a Roman goddess, the scope of her interests and patronage had broadened to include at least painting, poetry, drama, and teaching. Somewhat paradoxically, Minerva was also associated with the arts of war\u2014hence her image is usually that of a female dressed for battle.<ref name=smith2:1090>Smith (1867), p. 1:1090</ref>  Very early, Minerva was identified with the Greek goddess Athena, and invested with many of that deity's characteristics and iconography.<ref name=fowler234>Fowler (1911), p. 234</ref>  Eventually\u2014certainly by the 18th century\u2014Minerva had come to represent all of those qualities that might be wished for in a rational, virtuous, prudent, wise, and \"scientific\" man: just the sort of progressive individual who might found a new nation (or college) based on sound republican principles and liberal Christian (Protestant) morals.<ref name=king123>King (1750), p. 123</ref>  When the [[French Academy of Sciences|Paris Academy of Sciences]] met for the first time in 1666, a commemorative medal was struck portraying Minerva on its reverse, surrounded by symbols of astronomy, anatomy, and chemistry.<ref name=hahn4>Hahn (1971), p. 4</ref>  The [[American Academy of Arts and Sciences]], founded in 1780, took Minerva as its model, along with the motto ''\"Sub libertate florent\"'', intending to imply that the arts and sciences flourish best in a free society.<ref>{{cite book | year = 1785 | title = Memoirs of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences | publisher = Adams and Nourse | location = Boston | page = 1:638}}</ref>  Clearly, Minerva was very much an icon of the [[Scientific Revolution]] and the [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]].\n\nWhile the rationale behind the connection between Union College and Minerva is relatively clear, there is less agreement with respect to the history of the College's motto.<ref name=somers636/>  Its egalitarian theme is consistent with the non-denominational and generally democratic spirit of Union's founding. It also declares the brotherhood of man, or of the community of mankind, in a sense familiar to the Enlightenment (and, of course, to the French revolutionaries). But that it does so with the qualification \"under the laws of Minerva\" is important.<ref name=somers637>Somers (2003), p. 637</ref>  Even though Minerva was a pagan goddess, and the Union College founders devout Protestants, there was still plenty of room for a belief that men could come together as brothers in a community ruled by reason, virtue, and [[natural law]] (or, as the case may be, the [[Law of God]]). The Latin motto on the seal of Union University supports this argument: ''In necessariis unitas, in dubiis libertas, in omnibus caritas'' (English: Unity in necessary matters, freedom in doubtful matters, charity for all). An institution of higher learning fosters unity of purpose (hence \"brotherhood\"), but not always unity of opinion, hence the freedom to disagree. The \"laws of Minerva\" enjoin rational thought rather than obligatory doctrine. Not surprisingly, the founders believed that the key to achieving this ideal state is education.  Nearly all of the differences among human beings, wherever they may be found, argued [[John Locke]], are the result of diverse education.<ref name=locke2>Locke (1764), p. 2</ref>  The founders of Union College were unabashedly optimistic that education, learning, and science could build a better world.\n\n===Presidents===\n{{multiple image  | align     = right  | direction = horizontal  | image1    = Nott2.jpg  | width1    = 175  | alt1      =  | caption1  = [[Eliphalet Nott]], president 1804&ndash;1866  | image2    = Stephen Ainlay crop.jpeg  | width2    = 182  | alt2      =  | caption2  = Stephen Ainlay, president 2006-2018 }}\nUnion College has had nineteen presidents since its founding in 1795.

[[Arithmetic]], [[geometry]], and [[calculus]] (\"[[Method of Fluxions|fluxions]]\") gave some practical application in [[navigation]] and [[surveying]].  [[Astronomy]], [[chemistry]], and [[natural philosophy]] ([[physics]]) rounded out the study of science. Finally, [[theology]] and [[moral philosophy]] as capstone subjects typically dominated much of the junior and senior years.  [[Wikt:elective#Noun|Elective]]s were essentially unheard of.<ref>{{cite book | year = 1825 | title = The Laws of Yale College | publisher = The Journal Office | location = New Haven | page = 16}}; {{cite book | year = 1821 | title = Laws of Union College | publisher = Isaac Riggs | location = Schenectady | page = 25}}; {{cite book | year = 1830 | title = Catalogue of the Officers and Students of the College of New Jersey | publisher = George Sherman | location = Trenton | page = 10}}</ref>  But by the 1820s all of this began to change.<ref name=rudolph113>Rudolph (1965), p. 113</ref>\n\nAlthough [[Latin]] and [[Greek language|Greek]] remained a part of the curriculum (and do so to this day), new subjects were adopted that offered more readily apparent application to the busy commercial life of the new nation. Accordingly, French was gradually introduced into the college curriculum, sometimes as a substitute for Greek or [[Hebrew]].<ref name=rudolph51>Rudolph (1977), p. 51</ref> It is significant in this context that French was chosen for the Union College motto. By the second decade of the 19th century, calls for reform in higher education, especially in the traditional liberal arts colleges, were becoming increasingly demanding; a response was required if many of these institutions were to survive at all. The classical curriculum somehow needed to accommodate the needs of a practical, utilitarian, and egalitarian nation as it confronted its [[manifest destiny]] to conquer not only geography but nature itself. One solution to this problem was the so-called \"parallel course of study\" in scientific and \"literary\" subjects.<ref name=butts129>Butts (1939), p. 129</ref>  The basic idea was to offer a scientific curriculum in parallel to the classical curriculum, for those students wishing a more modern treatment of modern languages, mathematics, and science, equal in dignity to the traditional course of study.<ref name=Rudolph114>Rudolph (1965), p. 114</ref>  An early attempt to establish such a parallel scientific course was made by [[Hobart and William Smith College|Hobart College]] in [[Geneva, New York|Geneva]], New York, when it was founded in 1825, so that at least some students could get on with the \"practical business of life...without passing through a tedious course of classical studies.\"<ref name=hislop582n23>Hislop (1971), p. 582n23</ref>  But this experiment at Hobart soon languished, partly for lack of support by President [[Jasper Adams]]<ref name=adams32>Adams (1827), p. 32</ref> and partly for lack of funds.<ref name=butts135>Butts (1939), p. 135</ref>  A similar experiment launched by Union College in 1828 was to fare much better.\n\nIt was the [[Hudson Valley]] that gave birth to \u2013 and nurtured \u2013 the first successful attempts in America to raise applied science and technology to a collegiate level. The first technical college in the United States, [[United States Military Academy|the military academy at West Point]], was created by [[United States Congress|Congress]] in 1802.<ref name=Rudolph62>Rudolph (1977), p. 62</ref>  The institution that eventually became [[Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute]] (RPI) was founded in [[Troy, New York|Troy]], New York, in 1824 and incorporated in 1826 (and of which Union College president Eliphalet Nott was also president from 1829 to 1845).<ref name=sherwood484492>Sherwood (1900), pp. 484, 492</ref>  Union College introduced a parallel scientific curriculum in 1828 and a [[civil engineering]] program in 1845.<ref name=hough160>Hough (1885), p. 160</ref>  Union College, it has been said, was the \"one traditional liberal arts college in the first half of the nineteenth century to make a thoroughly uncompromising and effective place for applied science in the course of study\".<ref name=rudolph63>Rudolph (1977), p. 63</ref>  In fact, so successful were Union's reform efforts that by 1839 the College had one of the largest faculty in American higher education and an enrollment surpassed only by [[Yale University|Yale]].<ref name=guralnick38>Guralnick (1975), p. 38</ref>\n\n==Campus==\n\n===Architecture and design===\n[[File:Union1804.jpg|thumb|Union College's first home, an 1804 design built prior to the cohesive Ram\u00e9e-designed campus]]\n\nAfter Union College received its charter in 1795, it was quite natural that the college should carry on business in the same building already occupied by the Schenectady Academy. The college began conducting classes on the upper floor, while a [[grammar school]] continued to be conducted on the lower floor.<ref name=somers630>Somers (2003), p. 630</ref>  It soon became clear that this space would prove inadequate for the growing college (or at least for the optimistic plans of the founders). In 1796, the state of New York appropriated $10,000 (roughly ${{Formatprice|{{Inflation|US|10000|1800}}}} today) for a new building, and construction began two years later on the edge of the original Schenectady town site.<ref name=hough154>Hough (1885), p. 154</ref> The ground plan of the new buildings was to be {{Convert|150|by|60|ft|m}}, the superstructure rising three stories, topped by a [[cupola]].<ref name=hough155n>Hough (1885), p. 155n</ref>  There is reason to believe that the design of the building was influenced by that of [[Princeton University|Princeton]]'s [[Nassau Hall]] (sometimes described as the [[Italianate architecture|Italianate style]]).<ref name=somers789>Somers (2003), p. 789</ref>  The new building was occupied in 1804, despite continuing financial difficulties, and two dormitories were constructed nearby.\n\nHowever, Eliphalet Nott, arriving as president of the college in 1804 (having been a trustee since 1800) was not daunted by the obstacles to growth and expansion created by lack of funds, a reluctant [[New York State Legislature|legislature]], and a sometimes litigious Board of Trustees. Even as the booming city of Schenectady was alive with commercial activity,<ref name=hislop139>Hislop (1971), p. 139</ref> Nott was envisioning a college that would to a large extent protect and shield its students from the lowlife and temptations that inevitably accompanied rapid economic growth on the frontier. He also had no doubt that the size of the college would begin to steadily increase to meet the needs of a new national population.<ref name=raymond1:145>Raymond (1907), p. 145, 147</ref>  But the only way for this to happen was through increased financial support from the state of New York, and Nott began the first of many complicated negotiations to endow the college with funds yielded by an education lottery, the first of which was authorized on March 30, 1805.<ref name=raymond1:140>Raymond (1907), p. 140</ref><ref name=sherwood205>Sherwood (1900), p. 205</ref>\n\n[[File:Joseph Ram\u00e9e Union College USA.jpg|thumb|left|The original 1813 Ram\u00e9e plan of the Union College campus]]\nAccordingly, in July 1806, Nott and the trustees determined to acquire a large tract of land to the east of the [[Downtown Schenectady]], on a gentle slope up from the Mohawk River and facing nearly due west. This tract was not promisingly described by Nott some years later as \"pasture grounds, scarred by deep ravines, rendered at once unsightly and difficult of access by an alternation of swamp and sand hill ...\".<ref name=sherwood206>Sherwood (1900), p. 206</ref>  Clearly, the prospect was largely in the eye of the beholder. There was apparently even a sulphur spring on the hill,<ref name=somers136>Somers (2003), p. 136</ref> although it did not pose any threat to [[Saratoga Springs#The Springs|Saratoga Springs]].  Using primarily his own funds and credit, Nott purchased between {{Convert|250|and|300|acre|ha}} of the hill.<ref name=somers135>Somers (2003), p. 135</ref><ref name=raymond1:147>Raymond (1907), p. 1:147</ref>  By 1812 a stone wall had been built at the lower end of the slope, creating a [[Terrace (agriculture)|terrace]] upon which the preliminary foundations for buildings were begun. Then a meeting occurred that changed not only the Union College campus, but many other American college designs for the next several decades.<ref name=turner68>Turner (1984), p. 68</ref>  The catalyst for this venture was international financier [[David Parish]].<ref name=turner189>Turner (1996), p. 189</ref>\n\nThe [[French people|French]] [[landscape architect|landscape]] and [[architect|building architect]], [[Joseph-Jacques Ram\u00e9e|Joseph Jacques Ram\u00e9e]] had already established a reputation as a skilled designer of landscapes combined with houses and other kinds of buildings by the time he was persuaded to visit America in search of projects. One of his projects had been the design of the estate of David Parish's father in [[Hamburg]], and Parish remembered this when he sought an architect to help him develop settlements on vast tracts of land in northern New York he had purchased on speculation.<ref name=tunnard7>Tunnard (1964), p. 7</ref>  Ram\u00e9e arrived in the northern Adirondacks in late 1812 to work on projects in and around the small towns on Parish's land. But not even the ambitious Parish could keep the famous architect busy enough to support his family, so Parish also acted as agent in finding Ram\u00e9e other work.<ref name=turner182>Turner (1996), p. 182</ref><ref name=tunnard10>Tunnard (1964), p. 10</ref>  So, it was natural that on a return trip to Philadelphia in January 1813, Parish should introduce Ram\u00e9e to Eliphalet Nott, who was already in the college building business. Nott hired Ram\u00e9e almost immediately to draw up plans for the new campus, for the fairly grand sum of $1,500 (roughly ${{formatnum:{{Inflation|US|1500|1813|r=-2}}}} today).<ref name=tunnard10/>  Ram\u00e9e worked on the drawings for about a year,<ref name=turner68/> and construction of two of the college buildings proceeded quickly enough to permit occupation in 1814.<ref name=turner189/> The Union College campus thus became the first comprehensively planned college campus in the United States.<ref name=turner>Turner (1996), p. 190</ref>\n\n[[File:Unionaerial2.jpg|thumb|Aerial View of Union College, 1950]]\nWhile it would be many years before nearly all of the elements of Ram\u00e9e's original design were actually constructed, the plan itself, so to speak, broke new ground in college campus planning. On the terrace already prepared, the buildings were to be arranged to form a large, open courtyard, facing the West and the Mohawk River valley. The parallel buildings were {{Convert|600|ft|m}} apart and were all to be linked by [[Arcade (architecture)|arcades]], one of which formed a [[semicircle]] at the upper end of the courtyard. In the center of the space a [[Rotunda (architecture)|rotunda]] was planned, probably meant to be the college chapel. It has been said that \"Ram\u00e9e's Union College plan is important for introducing a new type of planning, involving many buildings related in complex ways to each other and to the surrounding landscape. It is also a milestone in the history of the American college campus. The most ambitious and comprehensive plan for a campus up to that time, the Union design became a model for collegiate planning.\"<ref name=turner/>  It seems very likely, for example, that Thomas Jefferson was aware of the Ram\u00e9e design for Union, either directly or through the influence of [[Benjamin Henry Latrobe|Benjamin Latrobe]].<ref name=turner214>Turner (1996), p. 214</ref><ref name=wills49>Wills (2002), p. 49</ref>  Certainly the final design at the [[University of Virginia]] is reminiscent of Ram\u00e9e's overall conception in many ways.  Indeed, the plan that Nott and Ram\u00e9e imagined and realized in Schenectady eventually found its way into the design of other colleges and universities throughout the country.<ref name=tunnard10/><ref name=somers598>Somers (2003), p. 598</ref><ref name=turner216>Turner (1996), p. 216</ref><ref name=turner71>Turner (1984), p. 71</ref>\n\n===Landmarks===\n[[File:Arts Bldg angled.jpg|thumb|Arts Building]]\n[[File:Grant Hall 6.JPG|thumb|Grant Hall]]\n[[File:Memorial Chapel 6.JPG|thumb|Memorial Chapel]]\n[[File:Nott SE Landscape.JPG|thumb|[[Nott Memorial]]]]\n[[File:Reamer from grass (landscape).JPG|thumb|Reamer Campus Center]]\n[[File:Webster House 1.jpg|thumb|Webster House]]\n'''Arts Building''': The Arts building is located at the east end of the Taylor Music Center (the former North Colonnade) and was an element of the original campus plan by Joseph Jacques Ram\u00e9e. Built in 1852 and dedicated as Philosophical Hall, it housed the \"natural philosophy\" departments of today's physics and chemistry. Site of the first analytical chemistry laboratory in the nation, it remained home to the physics department remained for over 100 years, midway in which it was renamed the Physics building.<ref name=somers59>Somers (2003), p. 59</ref>\n\n'''Grant Hall''':  The former [[Alpha Delta Phi]] House was built for the fraternity between 1895 and 1898. It is the oldest surviving structure on campus originally constructed as a fraternity house and still has the [[Alpha Delta Phi]] crest on the front face of the building. Its architect, Albert W. Fuller, also designed several other buildings on campus. After the fraternity's lease on the land expired, the building was completely renovated by the college, and it reopened in the summer of 2001 as the Grant Admissions Center.<ref name=somers28>Somers (2003), p. 28</ref>\n\n'''Hale House''':  Often still called South Colonnade, this building was constructed in 1815 following the general design for the campus laid out by Ram\u00e9e. It originally contained recitation rooms and laboratories as well as faculty apartments. A gift from Walter C. Baker (class of 1915) and his wife allowed the building to be converted into a much-needed college dining hall with faculty and student lounges in 1935&ndash;1936. It was named in honor of Professor Edward Everett Hale, who had once lived in part of the building. It is currently used as a dining hall and meeting space for special events.<ref name=somers360>Somers (2003), p. 360</ref>\n\n'''Jackson's Garden''': Begun in the 1830s by Professor Isaac Jackson of the Mathematics Department, Jackson's Garden comprises {{Convert|8|acre|ha}} of formal gardens and woodlands. Sited where Ramee's original plans called for a garden, it initially featured a mix of vegetables, shrubs, and flowers \u2013 some of which were grown from seeds sent by botanists and botanical enthusiasts from around the world. As early as 1844 it drew the admiration of esteemed visitors such as [[John James Audubon]], and evolved into a sweeping retreat for both students and faculty.<ref name=somers411>Somers (2003), p. 411</ref>\n\n'''Lippman Hall''': Opened in 1967 as the Social Sciences building, today's Lippman Hall serves as one of the cornerstones of the liberal arts tradition at Union.

While it was probably intended to be a chapel in its original conception, the Nott Memorial's primary purpose when finally built was aesthetic. It served as the library until 1961 when Schaffer Library was built. Its design bears some resemblance to the [[Radcliffe Camera]] at [[Oxford University]].

It was built between 1855 and 1856 according to plans developed by College President Eliphalet Nott and Treasurer Jonathan Pearson (class of 1835) in consultation with Albany architect William L. Woolett. Better known as Geological Hall throughout its early years, it did indeed contain the college's primary chapel until 1925, although the chapel was not formally laid out with its balconies and wood paneling until the 1870s.<ref name=somers311>Somers (2003), p. 331</ref>\n\n'''Reamer Campus Center''': Built in 1910 as the General Engineering Building with funds provided in part by [[Andrew Carnegie]], this building was home to the Civil Engineering Department and a variety of other academic departments until the 1970s. It was designed by Albert W. Fuller, the architect of a number of other buildings on campus. After 1971 it served as a student activity center, but it was not until a major reconstruction and expansion project in 1985 that it became a true College Center with numerous dining and lounge spaces, an outdoor plaza, an auditorium, meeting rooms, and offices for student-related services and organizations.<ref name=somers141>Somers (2003), p. 141</ref>\n\n'''[[#Schaffer Library|Schaffer Library]]''': Schaffer Library, erected in 1961, was the first building constructed at Union for the sole purpose of housing the college library. Trustee Henry Schaffer donated the majority of funds needed for its construction as well as for a later expansion between 1973 and 1974. The original building was designed by [[Walker O. Cain]] of [[McKim, Mead and White]] and built by the Hamilton Construction Company. Additional interior work supported by the Schaffer Foundation was done in the 1980s. After structural problems with the 1973&ndash;1974 addition developed, a major project to renovate and expand the library was undertaken in the late 1990s. Designed by the firm of [[Perry Dean Rogers Architects|Perry, Dean, Rogers and Partners]], the renovation provided space for College Media Services, Writing Center, and a language lab.<ref name=somers627>Somers (2003), p. 627</ref>\n\n'''Webster House''': Webster House was built between 1901 and 1903 to house the Schenectady Public Library on land that had been purchased from the college. Its construction was financed in part by Andrew Carnegie, making it one of over 2,500 [[Carnegie Library|Carnegie Libraries]] throughout the world, including Union's own college library at the time. [[General Electric]] also contributed funds towards its construction. Union repurchased the building and land in 1970 after the public library moved to a larger facility in the city. For several years the space was used for student and other organizations. It was renovated into a dormitory in 1973 and named for College President Harrison Webster (class of 1868 and President 1884&ndash;1894).<ref name=somers786>Somers (2003), p. 786</ref>\n\n==Organization and administration==\n\n=== Board of Trustees ===\n\"The Trustees of Union College\", as a corporate body, has owned the college and been the college's designated legal representative throughout its history.<ref name=somers745>Somers (2003), p. 745</ref> The Board consists of four life trustees, twenty-one term trustees, four alumni trustees, two faculty trustees, two student trustees, and the president of the college.

These include the habits and skills of critical inquiry, a tolerance for diverse points of view, an awareness of ambiguity, and a deep curiosity about the social, ethical, cultural, political, and natural world in which we live. All of this takes place in an environment that cultivates skills in analytical reading, clear and vigorous writing, and convincing argumentation.\"<ref>{{cite web |title= First-Year Preceptorial |url= http://www.union.edu/Resources/Academic/precept/index.php |accessdate=2009-08-28}}</ref> The typical FYP relies on a significant reading load of traditional as well as modern texts, together with substantial classroom discussion and written analysis of ideas and authors.\n\nThe SRS, as a complementary course, is intended to focus on the learning of research methods, evidence-based reasoning, and the techniques of sound written argumentation.<ref>{{cite web |title= Sophomore Research Seminar |url= http://www.union.edu/Resources/Academic/advising/gen_ed/srs.php |accessdate=2009-08-28}}</ref> The typical SRS concentrates on a particular conceptual or historical problem and culminates in a substantial research paper. Most SRS sections involve a professional librarian in cooperation with a teaching faculty member.\n\nMost undergraduates are required to complete a minimum of 36 term courses in all programs except engineering, which may require up to 40 courses (in two-degree programs, nine courses beyond the requirements for the professional degrees) and students in the Leadership in Medicine program, which requires around 45-50 courses.<ref>{{cite book | title = Union College Academic Register, 2008\u20132009 |publisher=Union College | page = 3}}</ref>\n\n===Admissions===\nFor the Class of 2022 (enrolling fall 2018), Union College received 6,716 applications and accepted 2,598 (38.7%), with 571 enrolling.<ref name=CDS>{{cite web|url=https://www.union.edu/institutional-research/common-data-set-cds# |title=Union College Common Data Set 2018-2019 |publisher=Union College}}</ref>  The middle 50% range of [[SAT]] scores of enrolled freshmen was 620-700 for reading and writing, and 650-730 for math, while the middle 50% range of the [[ACT (test)|ACT]] composite score was 28-32.<ref name=CDS/>  The average high school grade point average ([[GPA]]) was 3.40.<ref name=CDS/>\n\n===Undergraduate research===\nUndergraduate research at Union College had its origin in the first third of the 20th century, when chemistry professor Charles Hurd began involving students in his [[colloid chemistry]] investigations. Since then, undergraduate research has taken hold in all disciplines at the college, making this endeavor what has been termed \"the [[:wiktionary:linchpin|linchpin]]\" of the Union education. By the mid-1960s several disciplines at Union had established a senior research thesis requirement, and in 1978 the college began funding faculty-mentored student research in all disciplines. This was followed by the creation of funded summer research opportunities, again in all disciplines at the college, in 1986.\nExamples of possible programs include summer undergraduate research, in which students are supported each summer by the college on independent projects with a sponsoring faculty member; the [[National Conference on Undergraduate Research]], to which Union sends one of the largest contingents to its national conference each year where the students present their work and interact with peers from colleges and universities across the country; general internships at such nearby sites as [[GE Global Research|General Electric's Global Research Center]]; and the Steinmetz Symposium day. On a Friday in May, over 300 students, previously carrying out research within the past year, present their research and projects to their fellow students, teachers, staff, and visitors. Students also have the school day off, and presentations take form in slideshows, performances, lectures, and many other creative forms.<ref>{{cite web |title=Undergraduate Research |publisher=Union College |url=http://www.union.edu/Resources/Academic/undergrad_research/index.php |accessdate=2009-08-31}}</ref>\n\n===Study abroad programs===\nUnion College makes available a variety of opportunities for formal study outside the United States, the most popular of which are the Terms Abroad Programs.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.union.edu/offices/international/|title=International Programs              - Union College|publisher=|accessdate=7 December 2016}}</ref>  Currently, Terms Abroad are offered for residence and study on nearly every continent, some in cooperation with [[Hobart and William Smith Colleges]].

The library currently makes available onsite about 750,000 books in print as well as electronic formats. The two largest historical, electronic collections are ''Early English Books Online'' (EEBO) and ''Eighteenth Century Collections Online'' (ECCO). EEBO contains digital facsimile pages of nearly every work printed in English from 1473 to 1700, while ECCO continues the project up to 1800. The library's print and rare book collections are especially strong in [[18th century in literature|18th]] and [[19th century in literature|19th century literature]], the [[Scientific Revolution]], and the [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]].

Three other surviving national fraternities \u2013 [[Psi Upsilon]] (1833), [[Chi Psi]] (1841), and [[Theta Delta Chi]] (1847) \u2013 were founded at Union in the next two decades; on account of this fecundity, Union would in the twentieth century call itself the '[[Mother of Fraternities]]'.<ref name=\"somers304\"/>  As with most historical generalizations, this one requires qualification. What does seem true is that Union's claim to priority is that the oldest secret Greek letter social fraternity with a continuing record was founded at the college. None of the early societies at Union or elsewhere can precisely challenge the claim of Union's Sigma Phi, which became the first national fraternity with the founding of a second chapter at Hamilton College in 1831,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sigmaphi.org/?page=History|title=History of the Sigma Phi - Sigma Phi Society|publisher=|accessdate=7 December 2016}}</ref> but the founders of the first fraternities at Union were obviously imitating or improving upon existing models.

Founded in 1795, it was the first institution of higher learning chartered by the [[New York State Board of Regents]].  In the 19th century, it became the \"[[Mother of Fraternities]]\",<ref name=somers304>Somers (2003), p. 304</ref> as three of the earliest [[Fraternities and sororities in North America|such organizations]] were established there.  After 175 years as a traditional all-male institution, Union College began enrolling women in 1970.\n\nThe college offers a [[liberal arts]] curriculum across some 21 academic departments, as well as opportunities for interdepartmental [[Academic major|major]]s and self-designed organizing theme majors. In common with most liberal arts colleges, Union offers a wide array of courses in arts, sciences, literature, and foreign languages, but, in common with only a few other liberal arts colleges, Union also offers [[ABET|ABET-accredited]] undergraduate degrees in [[computer engineering]], [[bioengineering]], [[electrical engineering]], and [[mechanical engineering]]. By the time they graduate, about 60% of Union students will have engaged in some form of international study or [[study abroad]].<ref>{{cite web |title=Union College Office of Institutional Studies |url=http://www.union.edu/Resources/Campus/institutional_studies/index.php |accessdate=2009-09-21|year=2008}}</ref>\n{{TOC limit}}\n\n==History==\n\n===Founding===\n[[File:Union1795nocap.jpg|thumb|border|left|The Schenectady Academy (Old Union College), 1795]]\n\nChartered in 1795,<ref name=fortenbaugh3>Fortenbaugh (1978), p. 3</ref> Union was one the first [[non-denominational]] institutions of [[higher education]] in the United States, and the second college established in the [[State of New York]].\n\nFrom 1636 to 1769, only nine institutions of [[higher education]] were founded on a permanent basis in [[Colonial America]].{{Ref label|a|a|none}} Most had been founded in association with British religious denominations devoted to the perpetuation of their respective Christian denominations.,<ref name=\"Tewksbury 1932, p. 59\">Tewksbury (1932), p. 59</ref> Union College was to be founded with a broader ecumenical basis.\n\nOnly [[Columbia University]] (the successor of King's College, founded in 1754),<ref>{{cite book |  year = 1902 | title = A History of Columbia University, 1754\u20131904 | publisher = Columbia University Press | location = New York | page = 1}}</ref> had preceded Union in New York. Twenty-five years later impetus for another institution grew.  Certain that [[General (United Kingdom)|General]] [[John Burgoyne]]'s defeat at the [[Battle of Saratoga]] in 1777 would mean a new nation, nearly 1,000 citizens of [[upstate New York|northern New York]] (which then included what eventually became [[Vermont]]) began the first popular demand for higher education in America.<ref name=fox10>Fox (1945), p. 10</ref> As a democratic cultural changes rose and began to become dominant<ref name=rudoloph34>Rudolph (1965), p. 34</ref> old ways, in particular the old purposes and structure of higher education, were being pushed aside.<ref name=boorstin153>Boorstin (1965), p. 153</ref>\n\n[[Schenectady]], originally a Mohawk outpost, was a city founded and dominated by the [[Netherlands|Dutch]], with about 4,000 residents,<ref name=\"Somers 2003, p. 296\">Somers (2003), p. 296</ref> was after [[Albany, New York|Albany]] and [[New York City]] the third largest in the state. The [[Dutch Reformed Church]], began to show an interest in establishing an academy or college under its control there. In 1778, the Schenectady Dutch Reformed Church invited the Rev. Dirck Romeyn of [[New Jersey]] to visit.<ref name=pearson119>Pearson (1880/1980), p. 119</ref> Returning home, he authored a plan in 1782 for such an institution, and was summoned two years later<ref name=fortenbaugh36>Fortenbaugh (1978), p. 36</ref> to finally come help found it.\n\nThe Schenectady Academy was established in 1785 as the city's first organized school.<ref name=Neisular20>Neisular (1964), p. 20</ref> It immediately flourished, reaching an enrollment of about 100 within a year.  By at least 1792 it offered a full four-year college course, as well as one of elementary and practical subjects taught mainly to girls.<ref name=somers629>Somers (2003), p. 629</ref> Attempts to charter the Academy as a college with the [[University of the State of New York|Board of Regents of the University of the State of New York]] in 1786, 1792, and 1793 were rejected<ref name=\"Somers 2003, p. 296\"/> on the grounds the school was not yet either academically nor financially qualified.<ref name=hough146>Hough (1885), p. 146</ref>\n\nThe following year the school reapplied, as \"Union College\", a name chosen to reflect the resolution that the school should be free of any specific religious affiliation.<ref name=raymond1:34>Raymond (1907), p. 1:34</ref>  The resulting institution was awarded its charter on February 25, 1795 &ndash; still celebrated by the College as \"Founders' Day\".<ref name=yates423>Yates (1902), p. 423</ref>\n\n===Seals and mottos===\n[[File:SealUnionUniversity.jpg|thumb|The Seal of [[Union University (New York)|Union University]] on the Exterior Wall of the [[University Club of New York]] in Manhattan]]\n[[File:Minervaliberty.jpg|thumb|''[[Minerva]] as the Patroness of American Liberty'' (1791) by [[Giuseppe Ceracchi]]]]\n\nThe College's charter provided for the design of an official [[Seal (impression)|seal]] to be used on [[diploma]]s and other official business documents and correspondence. The Trustees were also authorized to select the \"devices and inscription\" to be engraved on the seal.<ref name=raymond1:38>Raymond (1907), p. 1:38</ref>  A committee of four Trustees was appointed to look into the matter, and a seal was approved in November 1796. The original seal and its press have been lost, but it is known that it was nearly identical to the seal in use today (from an impression on a document from 1796).<ref name=fortenbaugh74>Fortenbaugh (1978), p. 74</ref>\n\nThe Union College seal combines ancient and modern elements in balanced proportions. The head of the [[Roman goddess]] [[Minerva]] ([[Greek goddess]] [[Athena]]) appears in the center of an oval with an outside star pattern surrounding the whole.  Around the central figure are the [[French language|French]] words ''\"Sous les lois de Minerve nous devenons tous fr\u00e8res et s\u0153urs\"'' ({{lang-en|Under the laws of Minerva, we all become brothers and sisters}}).<ref name=fortenbaugh73>Fortenbaugh (1978), p. 73</ref>  Originally, the motto ended with the [[French language|French]] word ''\"fr\u00e8res\"'' ({{lang-en|brothers}}), but in 2015 the College modified the motto to add the [[French language|French]] words ''\"et s\u0153urs\"'' ({{lang-en|and sisters}}).<ref name=sisters>{{cite web|title= Union's age-old motto gets a modern makeover|url=https://www.union.edu/news/stories/2015/11/unions-age-old-motto-gets-a-modern-makeover.php|accessdate=23 July 2018}}</ref> On a banner just above the central figure are the words ''\"St: of N: York\"'' and on a similar banner below the central figure appear the words: ''\"Union College 1795\"''. The precise origins of the motto and the choice of Minerva as the fundamental element of the College seal are obscure, but two things are certain: like most colleges of the time, Union was deeply rooted in the classical tradition, but, unlike most colleges, Union chose a modern language rather than [[Latin]] for its motto. The resulting tone of the entire seal is thus historically aware, but distinctly modern in outlook.<ref name=somers636>Somers (2003), p. 636; See also Fortenbaugh, ''passim''.</ref>\n\nIt is not at all surprising that the original trustees should have chosen Minerva as their herald and representative. Minerva began her mythological career as a local Italian deity ([[Etruscan mythology|Etruscan]], but possibly with Greek influences), patroness of the arts and crafts.<ref name=altheim265>Altheim (1938), p. 265</ref>  By the time she was well established as a Roman goddess, the scope of her interests and patronage had broadened to include at least painting, poetry, drama, and teaching. Somewhat paradoxically, Minerva was also associated with the arts of war\u2014hence her image is usually that of a female dressed for battle.<ref name=smith2:1090>Smith (1867), p. 1:1090</ref>  Very early, Minerva was identified with the Greek goddess Athena, and invested with many of that deity's characteristics and iconography.<ref name=fowler234>Fowler (1911), p. 234</ref>  Eventually\u2014certainly by the 18th century\u2014Minerva had come to represent all of those qualities that might be wished for in a rational, virtuous, prudent, wise, and \"scientific\" man: just the sort of progressive individual who might found a new nation (or college) based on sound republican principles and liberal Christian (Protestant) morals.<ref name=king123>King (1750), p. 123</ref>  When the [[French Academy of Sciences|Paris Academy of Sciences]] met for the first time in 1666, a commemorative medal was struck portraying Minerva on its reverse, surrounded by symbols of astronomy, anatomy, and chemistry.<ref name=hahn4>Hahn (1971), p. 4</ref>  The [[American Academy of Arts and Sciences]], founded in 1780, took Minerva as its model, along with the motto ''\"Sub libertate florent\"'', intending to imply that the arts and sciences flourish best in a free society.<ref>{{cite book | year = 1785 | title = Memoirs of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences | publisher = Adams and Nourse | location = Boston | page = 1:638}}</ref>  Clearly, Minerva was very much an icon of the [[Scientific Revolution]] and the [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]].\n\nWhile the rationale behind the connection between Union College and Minerva is relatively clear, there is less agreement with respect to the history of the College's motto.<ref name=somers636/>  Its egalitarian theme is consistent with the non-denominational and generally democratic spirit of Union's founding. It also declares the brotherhood of man, or of the community of mankind, in a sense familiar to the Enlightenment (and, of course, to the French revolutionaries). But that it does so with the qualification \"under the laws of Minerva\" is important.<ref name=somers637>Somers (2003), p. 637</ref>  Even though Minerva was a pagan goddess, and the Union College founders devout Protestants, there was still plenty of room for a belief that men could come together as brothers in a community ruled by reason, virtue, and [[natural law]] (or, as the case may be, the [[Law of God]]). The Latin motto on the seal of Union University supports this argument: ''In necessariis unitas, in dubiis libertas, in omnibus caritas'' (English: Unity in necessary matters, freedom in doubtful matters, charity for all). An institution of higher learning fosters unity of purpose (hence \"brotherhood\"), but not always unity of opinion, hence the freedom to disagree. The \"laws of Minerva\" enjoin rational thought rather than obligatory doctrine. Not surprisingly, the founders believed that the key to achieving this ideal state is education.  Nearly all of the differences among human beings, wherever they may be found, argued [[John Locke]], are the result of diverse education.<ref name=locke2>Locke (1764), p. 2</ref>  The founders of Union College were unabashedly optimistic that education, learning, and science could build a better world.\n\n===Presidents===\n{{multiple image  | align     = right  | direction = horizontal  | image1    = Nott2.jpg  | width1    = 175  | alt1      =  | caption1  = [[Eliphalet Nott]], president 1804&ndash;1866  | image2    = Stephen Ainlay crop.jpeg  | width2    = 182  | alt2      =  | caption2  = Stephen Ainlay, president 2006-2018 }}\nUnion College has had nineteen presidents since its founding in 1795.

[[Arithmetic]], [[geometry]], and [[calculus]] (\"[[Method of Fluxions|fluxions]]\") gave some practical application in [[navigation]] and [[surveying]].  [[Astronomy]], [[chemistry]], and [[natural philosophy]] ([[physics]]) rounded out the study of science. Finally, [[theology]] and [[moral philosophy]] as capstone subjects typically dominated much of the junior and senior years.  [[Wikt:elective#Noun|Elective]]s were essentially unheard of.<ref>{{cite book | year = 1825 | title = The Laws of Yale College | publisher = The Journal Office | location = New Haven | page = 16}}; {{cite book | year = 1821 | title = Laws of Union College | publisher = Isaac Riggs | location = Schenectady | page = 25}}; {{cite book | year = 1830 | title = Catalogue of the Officers and Students of the College of New Jersey | publisher = George Sherman | location = Trenton | page = 10}}</ref>  But by the 1820s all of this began to change.<ref name=rudolph113>Rudolph (1965), p. 113</ref>\n\nAlthough [[Latin]] and [[Greek language|Greek]] remained a part of the curriculum (and do so to this day), new subjects were adopted that offered more readily apparent application to the busy commercial life of the new nation. Accordingly, French was gradually introduced into the college curriculum, sometimes as a substitute for Greek or [[Hebrew]].<ref name=rudolph51>Rudolph (1977), p. 51</ref> It is significant in this context that French was chosen for the Union College motto. By the second decade of the 19th century, calls for reform in higher education, especially in the traditional liberal arts colleges, were becoming increasingly demanding; a response was required if many of these institutions were to survive at all. The classical curriculum somehow needed to accommodate the needs of a practical, utilitarian, and egalitarian nation as it confronted its [[manifest destiny]] to conquer not only geography but nature itself. One solution to this problem was the so-called \"parallel course of study\" in scientific and \"literary\" subjects.<ref name=butts129>Butts (1939), p. 129</ref>  The basic idea was to offer a scientific curriculum in parallel to the classical curriculum, for those students wishing a more modern treatment of modern languages, mathematics, and science, equal in dignity to the traditional course of study.<ref name=Rudolph114>Rudolph (1965), p. 114</ref>  An early attempt to establish such a parallel scientific course was made by [[Hobart and William Smith College|Hobart College]] in [[Geneva, New York|Geneva]], New York, when it was founded in 1825, so that at least some students could get on with the \"practical business of life...without passing through a tedious course of classical studies.\"<ref name=hislop582n23>Hislop (1971), p. 582n23</ref>  But this experiment at Hobart soon languished, partly for lack of support by President [[Jasper Adams]]<ref name=adams32>Adams (1827), p. 32</ref> and partly for lack of funds.<ref name=butts135>Butts (1939), p. 135</ref>  A similar experiment launched by Union College in 1828 was to fare much better.\n\nIt was the [[Hudson Valley]] that gave birth to \u2013 and nurtured \u2013 the first successful attempts in America to raise applied science and technology to a collegiate level. The first technical college in the United States, [[United States Military Academy|the military academy at West Point]], was created by [[United States Congress|Congress]] in 1802.<ref name=Rudolph62>Rudolph (1977), p. 62</ref>  The institution that eventually became [[Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute]] (RPI) was founded in [[Troy, New York|Troy]], New York, in 1824 and incorporated in 1826 (and of which Union College president Eliphalet Nott was also president from 1829 to 1845).<ref name=sherwood484492>Sherwood (1900), pp. 484, 492</ref>  Union College introduced a parallel scientific curriculum in 1828 and a [[civil engineering]] program in 1845.<ref name=hough160>Hough (1885), p. 160</ref>  Union College, it has been said, was the \"one traditional liberal arts college in the first half of the nineteenth century to make a thoroughly uncompromising and effective place for applied science in the course of study\".<ref name=rudolph63>Rudolph (1977), p. 63</ref>  In fact, so successful were Union's reform efforts that by 1839 the College had one of the largest faculty in American higher education and an enrollment surpassed only by [[Yale University|Yale]].<ref name=guralnick38>Guralnick (1975), p. 38</ref>\n\n==Campus==\n\n===Architecture and design===\n[[File:Union1804.jpg|thumb|Union College's first home, an 1804 design built prior to the cohesive Ram\u00e9e-designed campus]]\n\nAfter Union College received its charter in 1795, it was quite natural that the college should carry on business in the same building already occupied by the Schenectady Academy. The college began conducting classes on the upper floor, while a [[grammar school]] continued to be conducted on the lower floor.<ref name=somers630>Somers (2003), p. 630</ref>  It soon became clear that this space would prove inadequate for the growing college (or at least for the optimistic plans of the founders). In 1796, the state of New York appropriated $10,000 (roughly ${{Formatprice|{{Inflation|US|10000|1800}}}} today) for a new building, and construction began two years later on the edge of the original Schenectady town site.<ref name=hough154>Hough (1885), p. 154</ref> The ground plan of the new buildings was to be {{Convert|150|by|60|ft|m}}, the superstructure rising three stories, topped by a [[cupola]].<ref name=hough155n>Hough (1885), p. 155n</ref>  There is reason to believe that the design of the building was influenced by that of [[Princeton University|Princeton]]'s [[Nassau Hall]] (sometimes described as the [[Italianate architecture|Italianate style]]).<ref name=somers789>Somers (2003), p. 789</ref>  The new building was occupied in 1804, despite continuing financial difficulties, and two dormitories were constructed nearby.\n\nHowever, Eliphalet Nott, arriving as president of the college in 1804 (having been a trustee since 1800) was not daunted by the obstacles to growth and expansion created by lack of funds, a reluctant [[New York State Legislature|legislature]], and a sometimes litigious Board of Trustees. Even as the booming city of Schenectady was alive with commercial activity,<ref name=hislop139>Hislop (1971), p. 139</ref> Nott was envisioning a college that would to a large extent protect and shield its students from the lowlife and temptations that inevitably accompanied rapid economic growth on the frontier. He also had no doubt that the size of the college would begin to steadily increase to meet the needs of a new national population.<ref name=raymond1:145>Raymond (1907), p. 145, 147</ref>  But the only way for this to happen was through increased financial support from the state of New York, and Nott began the first of many complicated negotiations to endow the college with funds yielded by an education lottery, the first of which was authorized on March 30, 1805.<ref name=raymond1:140>Raymond (1907), p. 140</ref><ref name=sherwood205>Sherwood (1900), p. 205</ref>\n\n[[File:Joseph Ram\u00e9e Union College USA.jpg|thumb|left|The original 1813 Ram\u00e9e plan of the Union College campus]]\nAccordingly, in July 1806, Nott and the trustees determined to acquire a large tract of land to the east of the [[Downtown Schenectady]], on a gentle slope up from the Mohawk River and facing nearly due west. This tract was not promisingly described by Nott some years later as \"pasture grounds, scarred by deep ravines, rendered at once unsightly and difficult of access by an alternation of swamp and sand hill ...\".<ref name=sherwood206>Sherwood (1900), p. 206</ref>  Clearly, the prospect was largely in the eye of the beholder. There was apparently even a sulphur spring on the hill,<ref name=somers136>Somers (2003), p. 136</ref> although it did not pose any threat to [[Saratoga Springs#The Springs|Saratoga Springs]].  Using primarily his own funds and credit, Nott purchased between {{Convert|250|and|300|acre|ha}} of the hill.<ref name=somers135>Somers (2003), p. 135</ref><ref name=raymond1:147>Raymond (1907), p. 1:147</ref>  By 1812 a stone wall had been built at the lower end of the slope, creating a [[Terrace (agriculture)|terrace]] upon which the preliminary foundations for buildings were begun. Then a meeting occurred that changed not only the Union College campus, but many other American college designs for the next several decades.<ref name=turner68>Turner (1984), p. 68</ref>  The catalyst for this venture was international financier [[David Parish]].<ref name=turner189>Turner (1996), p. 189</ref>\n\nThe [[French people|French]] [[landscape architect|landscape]] and [[architect|building architect]], [[Joseph-Jacques Ram\u00e9e|Joseph Jacques Ram\u00e9e]] had already established a reputation as a skilled designer of landscapes combined with houses and other kinds of buildings by the time he was persuaded to visit America in search of projects. One of his projects had been the design of the estate of David Parish's father in [[Hamburg]], and Parish remembered this when he sought an architect to help him develop settlements on vast tracts of land in northern New York he had purchased on speculation.<ref name=tunnard7>Tunnard (1964), p. 7</ref>  Ram\u00e9e arrived in the northern Adirondacks in late 1812 to work on projects in and around the small towns on Parish's land. But not even the ambitious Parish could keep the famous architect busy enough to support his family, so Parish also acted as agent in finding Ram\u00e9e other work.<ref name=turner182>Turner (1996), p. 182</ref><ref name=tunnard10>Tunnard (1964), p. 10</ref>  So, it was natural that on a return trip to Philadelphia in January 1813, Parish should introduce Ram\u00e9e to Eliphalet Nott, who was already in the college building business. Nott hired Ram\u00e9e almost immediately to draw up plans for the new campus, for the fairly grand sum of $1,500 (roughly ${{formatnum:{{Inflation|US|1500|1813|r=-2}}}} today).<ref name=tunnard10/>  Ram\u00e9e worked on the drawings for about a year,<ref name=turner68/> and construction of two of the college buildings proceeded quickly enough to permit occupation in 1814.<ref name=turner189/> The Union College campus thus became the first comprehensively planned college campus in the United States.<ref name=turner>Turner (1996), p. 190</ref>\n\n[[File:Unionaerial2.jpg|thumb|Aerial View of Union College, 1950]]\nWhile it would be many years before nearly all of the elements of Ram\u00e9e's original design were actually constructed, the plan itself, so to speak, broke new ground in college campus planning. On the terrace already prepared, the buildings were to be arranged to form a large, open courtyard, facing the West and the Mohawk River valley. The parallel buildings were {{Convert|600|ft|m}} apart and were all to be linked by [[Arcade (architecture)|arcades]], one of which formed a [[semicircle]] at the upper end of the courtyard. In the center of the space a [[Rotunda (architecture)|rotunda]] was planned, probably meant to be the college chapel. It has been said that \"Ram\u00e9e's Union College plan is important for introducing a new type of planning, involving many buildings related in complex ways to each other and to the surrounding landscape. It is also a milestone in the history of the American college campus. The most ambitious and comprehensive plan for a campus up to that time, the Union design became a model for collegiate planning.\"<ref name=turner/>  It seems very likely, for example, that Thomas Jefferson was aware of the Ram\u00e9e design for Union, either directly or through the influence of [[Benjamin Henry Latrobe|Benjamin Latrobe]].<ref name=turner214>Turner (1996), p. 214</ref><ref name=wills49>Wills (2002), p. 49</ref>  Certainly the final design at the [[University of Virginia]] is reminiscent of Ram\u00e9e's overall conception in many ways.  Indeed, the plan that Nott and Ram\u00e9e imagined and realized in Schenectady eventually found its way into the design of other colleges and universities throughout the country.<ref name=tunnard10/><ref name=somers598>Somers (2003), p. 598</ref><ref name=turner216>Turner (1996), p. 216</ref><ref name=turner71>Turner (1984), p. 71</ref>\n\n===Landmarks===\n[[File:Arts Bldg angled.jpg|thumb|Arts Building]]\n[[File:Grant Hall 6.JPG|thumb|Grant Hall]]\n[[File:Memorial Chapel 6.JPG|thumb|Memorial Chapel]]\n[[File:Nott SE Landscape.JPG|thumb|[[Nott Memorial]]]]\n[[File:Reamer from grass (landscape).JPG|thumb|Reamer Campus Center]]\n[[File:Webster House 1.jpg|thumb|Webster House]]\n'''Arts Building''': The Arts building is located at the east end of the Taylor Music Center (the former North Colonnade) and was an element of the original campus plan by Joseph Jacques Ram\u00e9e. Built in 1852 and dedicated as Philosophical Hall, it housed the \"natural philosophy\" departments of today's physics and chemistry. Site of the first analytical chemistry laboratory in the nation, it remained home to the physics department remained for over 100 years, midway in which it was renamed the Physics building.<ref name=somers59>Somers (2003), p. 59</ref>\n\n'''Grant Hall''':  The former [[Alpha Delta Phi]] House was built for the fraternity between 1895 and 1898. It is the oldest surviving structure on campus originally constructed as a fraternity house and still has the [[Alpha Delta Phi]] crest on the front face of the building. Its architect, Albert W. Fuller, also designed several other buildings on campus. After the fraternity's lease on the land expired, the building was completely renovated by the college, and it reopened in the summer of 2001 as the Grant Admissions Center.<ref name=somers28>Somers (2003), p. 28</ref>\n\n'''Hale House''':  Often still called South Colonnade, this building was constructed in 1815 following the general design for the campus laid out by Ram\u00e9e. It originally contained recitation rooms and laboratories as well as faculty apartments. A gift from Walter C. Baker (class of 1915) and his wife allowed the building to be converted into a much-needed college dining hall with faculty and student lounges in 1935&ndash;1936. It was named in honor of Professor Edward Everett Hale, who had once lived in part of the building. It is currently used as a dining hall and meeting space for special events.<ref name=somers360>Somers (2003), p. 360</ref>\n\n'''Jackson's Garden''': Begun in the 1830s by Professor Isaac Jackson of the Mathematics Department, Jackson's Garden comprises {{Convert|8|acre|ha}} of formal gardens and woodlands. Sited where Ramee's original plans called for a garden, it initially featured a mix of vegetables, shrubs, and flowers \u2013 some of which were grown from seeds sent by botanists and botanical enthusiasts from around the world. As early as 1844 it drew the admiration of esteemed visitors such as [[John James Audubon]], and evolved into a sweeping retreat for both students and faculty.<ref name=somers411>Somers (2003), p. 411</ref>\n\n'''Lippman Hall''': Opened in 1967 as the Social Sciences building, today's Lippman Hall serves as one of the cornerstones of the liberal arts tradition at Union. Housing faculty offices and classrooms, the building is one of the most heavily used on campus. A lead gift in 2009 from Jim Lippman (1979) supported a major renovation.<ref name=\"lippmanhall\">{{cite web | url=http://www.union.edu/lippman-hall/ | title=Lippman Hall | publisher=Union College | accessdate=15 March 2015}}</ref>\n\n'''Memorial Chapel''': Memorial Chapel was constructed between 1924 and 1925 to serve as the central college chapel and to honor Union graduates who lost their lives serving during wartime. The names of Union alumni who died in [[World War I]] and [[World War II]] appear on its south wall, flanked by portraits of college presidents.<ref name=somers486>Somers (2003), p. 486</ref>\n\n'''North and South College''': The first college buildings using Ram\u00e9e's plans, the pair were started in 1812 and occupied in 1814. Serving as dormitories, both buildings included faculty residences at each end until well into the 20th century.<ref name=somers505>Somers (2003), p. 505</ref>\n\n'''[[Nott Memorial]]''': Designed by Edward Tuckerman Potter (class of 1853), this building derived from the central rotunda in the original Ram\u00e9e Plan. While it was probably intended to be a chapel in its original conception, the Nott Memorial's primary purpose when finally built was aesthetic. It served as the library until 1961 when Schaffer Library was built. Its design bears some resemblance to the [[Radcliffe Camera]] at [[Oxford University]].  The building was added to the [[National Register of Historic Places]] in 1972<ref name=\"nris\">{{NRISref|2007a}}</ref> and designated a [[National Historic Landmark]] in 1986.<ref name=\"nhlsum\">{{cite web|url=http://tps.cr.nps.gov/nhl/detail.cfm?ResourceId=1253&ResourceType=Building|title=Nott Memorial Hall|date=2007-09-17|work=National Historic Landmark summary listing|publisher=National Park Service|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110606095605/http://tps.cr.nps.gov/nhl/detail.cfm?ResourceId=1253&ResourceType=Building|archivedate=2011-06-06}}</ref> After many years of neglect, the building was restored to its original glory between 1993 and 1995 and today is the centerpiece of the campus.<ref name=somers518>Somers (2003), p. 518</ref>\n\n'''Old Chapel''': The building now generally known as Old Chapel is located at the east end of South Colonnade / Hale House and was an element of the original campus plan by Ram\u00e9e. It was built between 1855 and 1856 according to plans developed by College President Eliphalet Nott and Treasurer Jonathan Pearson (class of 1835) in consultation with Albany architect William L. Woolett. Better known as Geological Hall throughout its early years, it did indeed contain the college's primary chapel until 1925, although the chapel was not formally laid out with its balconies and wood paneling until the 1870s.<ref name=somers311>Somers (2003), p. 331</ref>\n\n'''Reamer Campus Center''': Built in 1910 as the General Engineering Building with funds provided in part by [[Andrew Carnegie]], this building was home to the Civil Engineering Department and a variety of other academic departments until the 1970s. It was designed by Albert W. Fuller, the architect of a number of other buildings on campus. After 1971 it served as a student activity center, but it was not until a major reconstruction and expansion project in 1985 that it became a true College Center with numerous dining and lounge spaces, an outdoor plaza, an auditorium, meeting rooms, and offices for student-related services and organizations.<ref name=somers141>Somers (2003), p. 141</ref>\n\n'''[[#Schaffer Library|Schaffer Library]]''': Schaffer Library, erected in 1961, was the first building constructed at Union for the sole purpose of housing the college library. Trustee Henry Schaffer donated the majority of funds needed for its construction as well as for a later expansion between 1973 and 1974. The original building was designed by [[Walker O. Cain]] of [[McKim, Mead and White]] and built by the Hamilton Construction Company. Additional interior work supported by the Schaffer Foundation was done in the 1980s. After structural problems with the 1973&ndash;1974 addition developed, a major project to renovate and expand the library was undertaken in the late 1990s. Designed by the firm of [[Perry Dean Rogers Architects|Perry, Dean, Rogers and Partners]], the renovation provided space for College Media Services, Writing Center, and a language lab.<ref name=somers627>Somers (2003), p. 627</ref>\n\n'''Webster House''': Webster House was built between 1901 and 1903 to house the Schenectady Public Library on land that had been purchased from the college. Its construction was financed in part by Andrew Carnegie, making it one of over 2,500 [[Carnegie Library|Carnegie Libraries]] throughout the world, including Union's own college library at the time. [[General Electric]] also contributed funds towards its construction. Union repurchased the building and land in 1970 after the public library moved to a larger facility in the city. For several years the space was used for student and other organizations. It was renovated into a dormitory in 1973 and named for College President Harrison Webster (class of 1868 and President 1884&ndash;1894).<ref name=somers786>Somers (2003), p. 786</ref>\n\n==Organization and administration==\n\n=== Board of Trustees ===\n\"The Trustees of Union College\", as a corporate body, has owned the college and been the college's designated legal representative throughout its history.<ref name=somers745>Somers (2003), p. 745</ref> The Board consists of four life trustees, twenty-one term trustees, four alumni trustees, two faculty trustees, two student trustees, and the president of the college. The governor of the state of New York is also an ''ex officio'' member. The Board meets three times annually: in February, May, and October.

The purpose of the Student Forum is to consider issues and to review, recommend, or formulate policies (as appropriate) in areas involving the student body. In many ways, the structure of student government at Union College deliberately mirrors the structure of college government. The student body is represented by a president, vice-president of administration, vice-president of finance, vice-president of academics, vice-president of campus life, and vice-president for multicultural affairs. The entire Student Forum includes these officers together with two student trustees and 12 class representatives.<ref>{{cite web | title = Union College Student Forum | url = http://www.union.edu/StudentLife/Student_Activities/student_forum/index.php| accessdate = 2009-11-13}}\n</ref>\n\n=== Memberships and affiliations ===\nUnion College belongs to the [[Liberty League]], [[ECAC Hockey]], the [[Annapolis Group]], the [[Oberlin Group]], the [[Consortium of Liberal Arts Colleges]] (CLAC), and the New York Six Consortium.<ref>{{cite web | title = Union and other colleges form New York Six Consortium | url = http://www.union.edu/N/DS/s.php?s=8510| accessdate = 2009-11-13}}\n</ref>  Union is also a component of [[Union University (New York)|Union University]], which includes the [[Union Graduate College]], [[Albany Medical College]], [[Albany Law School]], the [[Dudley Observatory]], and the [[Albany College of Pharmacy and Health Sciences]].<ref>{{cite web | title = Union  University | url = http://www.union.edu/Academics/UnionUniversity/| accessdate = 2009-11-13}}\n</ref>\n\n=== Student media ===\nThe Union College radio station, [[WRUC]] 89.7,  dates from a student project in fall, 1910, but did not become \"live\" until 1912.<ref name=somers593>Somers (2003), p. 593</ref>  The Union College radio station was among the very first wireless transmitters in the country to broadcast regularly scheduled programs.<ref name=somers594>Somers (2003), p. 594</ref>  The weekly ''[[Concordiensis]]'', the principal newspaper of Union College since 1877, is the thirteenth oldest student newspaper in the United States and the oldest continuously published newspaper in Schenectady.<ref name=somers184>Somers (2003), p. 184</ref>\n\n==Academics==\n\n[[File:Union Library Lane 2.JPG|thumb|[[Nott Memorial]] viewed from the south]]\n\nThe mission statement of Union College<ref>{{cite web |title=About Union: The Mission of the College |publisher=Union College |date=2008-05-31|accessdate=2010-09-30|url=http://www.union.edu/about/mission/index.php}}</ref> claims, in part, that Union will offer a liberal education that includes \"a wide range of disciplines and interdisciplinary programs in the liberal arts and engineering, as well as academic, athletic, cultural, and social activities, including opportunities to study abroad and to participate in undergraduate research and community service.\" The general education program and the requirements of the major are an essential component of this mission.<ref>{{cite book | title = Union College Academic Register, 2008\u20132009 |publisher= Union College | pages = 4\u20137}}</ref> In addition to a standard distribution requirement of courses in several disciplines, the general education curriculum includes two specially designed, required courses intended to develop critical reading and writing skills across the first two years of college:  the ''First-Year Preceptorial'' (FYP) and the ''Sophomore Research Seminar'' (SRS).\n\nThe mission of FYP is, \"through reading, writing, and discussing important ideas from diverse perspectives, [to help] students develop an appreciation for the values embodied in the liberal arts. These include the habits and skills of critical inquiry, a tolerance for diverse points of view, an awareness of ambiguity, and a deep curiosity about the social, ethical, cultural, political, and natural world in which we live. All of this takes place in an environment that cultivates skills in analytical reading, clear and vigorous writing, and convincing argumentation.\"<ref>{{cite web |title= First-Year Preceptorial |url= http://www.union.edu/Resources/Academic/precept/index.php |accessdate=2009-08-28}}</ref> The typical FYP relies on a significant reading load of traditional as well as modern texts, together with substantial classroom discussion and written analysis of ideas and authors.\n\nThe SRS, as a complementary course, is intended to focus on the learning of research methods, evidence-based reasoning, and the techniques of sound written argumentation.<ref>{{cite web |title= Sophomore Research Seminar |url= http://www.union.edu/Resources/Academic/advising/gen_ed/srs.php |accessdate=2009-08-28}}</ref> The typical SRS concentrates on a particular conceptual or historical problem and culminates in a substantial research paper. Most SRS sections involve a professional librarian in cooperation with a teaching faculty member.\n\nMost undergraduates are required to complete a minimum of 36 term courses in all programs except engineering, which may require up to 40 courses (in two-degree programs, nine courses beyond the requirements for the professional degrees) and students in the Leadership in Medicine program, which requires around 45-50 courses.<ref>{{cite book | title = Union College Academic Register, 2008\u20132009 |publisher=Union College | page = 3}}</ref>\n\n===Admissions===\nFor the Class of 2022 (enrolling fall 2018), Union College received 6,716 applications and accepted 2,598 (38.7%), with 571 enrolling.<ref name=CDS>{{cite web|url=https://www.union.edu/institutional-research/common-data-set-cds# |title=Union College Common Data Set 2018-2019 |publisher=Union College}}</ref>  The middle 50% range of [[SAT]] scores of enrolled freshmen was 620-700 for reading and writing, and 650-730 for math, while the middle 50% range of the [[ACT (test)|ACT]] composite score was 28-32.<ref name=CDS/>  The average high school grade point average ([[GPA]]) was 3.40.<ref name=CDS/>\n\n===Undergraduate research===\nUndergraduate research at Union College had its origin in the first third of the 20th century, when chemistry professor Charles Hurd began involving students in his [[colloid chemistry]] investigations. Since then, undergraduate research has taken hold in all disciplines at the college, making this endeavor what has been termed \"the [[:wiktionary:linchpin|linchpin]]\" of the Union education. By the mid-1960s several disciplines at Union had established a senior research thesis requirement, and in 1978 the college began funding faculty-mentored student research in all disciplines. This was followed by the creation of funded summer research opportunities, again in all disciplines at the college, in 1986.\nExamples of possible programs include summer undergraduate research, in which students are supported each summer by the college on independent projects with a sponsoring faculty member; the [[National Conference on Undergraduate Research]], to which Union sends one of the largest contingents to its national conference each year where the students present their work and interact with peers from colleges and universities across the country; general internships at such nearby sites as [[GE Global Research|General Electric's Global Research Center]]; and the Steinmetz Symposium day. On a Friday in May, over 300 students, previously carrying out research within the past year, present their research and projects to their fellow students, teachers, staff, and visitors. Students also have the school day off, and presentations take form in slideshows, performances, lectures, and many other creative forms.<ref>{{cite web |title=Undergraduate Research |publisher=Union College |url=http://www.union.edu/Resources/Academic/undergrad_research/index.php |accessdate=2009-08-31}}</ref>\n\n===Study abroad programs===\nUnion College makes available a variety of opportunities for formal study outside the United States, the most popular of which are the Terms Abroad Programs.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.union.edu/offices/international/|title=International Programs              - Union College|publisher=|accessdate=7 December 2016}}</ref>  Currently, Terms Abroad are offered for residence and study on nearly every continent, some in cooperation with [[Hobart and William Smith Colleges]].

The library currently makes available onsite about 750,000 books in print as well as electronic formats. The two largest historical, electronic collections are ''Early English Books Online'' (EEBO) and ''Eighteenth Century Collections Online'' (ECCO). EEBO contains digital facsimile pages of nearly every work printed in English from 1473 to 1700, while ECCO continues the project up to 1800. The library's print and rare book collections are especially strong in [[18th century in literature|18th]] and [[19th century in literature|19th century literature]], the [[Scientific Revolution]], and the [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]].

Three other surviving national fraternities \u2013 [[Psi Upsilon]] (1833), [[Chi Psi]] (1841), and [[Theta Delta Chi]] (1847) \u2013 were founded at Union in the next two decades; on account of this fecundity, Union would in the twentieth century call itself the '[[Mother of Fraternities]]'.<ref name=\"somers304\"/>  As with most historical generalizations, this one requires qualification. What does seem true is that Union's claim to priority is that the oldest secret Greek letter social fraternity with a continuing record was founded at the college. None of the early societies at Union or elsewhere can precisely challenge the claim of Union's Sigma Phi, which became the first national fraternity with the founding of a second chapter at Hamilton College in 1831,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sigmaphi.org/?page=History|title=History of the Sigma Phi - Sigma Phi Society|publisher=|accessdate=7 December 2016}}</ref> but the founders of the first fraternities at Union were obviously imitating or improving upon existing models.
