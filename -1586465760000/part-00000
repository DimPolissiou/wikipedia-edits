It was a box office failure but went on to become a [[cult film]].\n\n== Plot ==\nPeter Loew ([[Nicolas Cage]]) is a driven [[literary agent]] and an example of the stereotypical narcissistic and greedy [[yuppie]] of the 1980s: he works all day and club hops at night, with little in his life but alcohol, [[one-night stand]]s and the pursuit of money and prestige. However, he is slowly going [[insanity|insane]] and sees a therapist ([[Elizabeth Ashley]]) frequently. During these sessions, his declining [[mental health]] becomes clear through a series of increasingly bizarre rants which eventually begin to scare even the psychiatrist. After he takes home a girl he met in a club named Jackie ([[Kasi Lemmons]]), a bat flies in through his window, scaring them both. At his next session he mentions to his therapist that the struggle with the bat aroused him, and after visiting an art museum with Jackie the next day, he ditches her, and she leaves an angry message on his phone.\n\nLoew meets Rachel ([[Jennifer Beals]]) at a [[night club]], and takes her home. She pins him down, reveals vampire fangs and feeds on him. He soon begins to believe that he is metamorphosing into a [[vampire]]. He stares into a bathroom mirror and fails to see his reflection, he wears dark sunglasses during the day, and, when his \"fangs\" fail to develop, he purchases a pair of cheap plastic vampire teeth. All the while, Rachel visits him nightly to feed on his blood. Shortly after, Loew experiences mood swings and calls Jackie back apologetically, asking to meet her at a bar. As he is about to leave, a jealous Rachel appears and beckons him back inside. A dejected Jackie eventually leaves the bar and leaves an angry note on his door asking him to leave her alone.\n\nA subplot concerns a secretary working at Loew's office, Alva Restrepo ([[Mar\u00eda Conchita Alonso]]). Loew torments her by forcing her to search through an enormous file for a 1963 contract. When she fails to find the contract, he at first browbeats and humiliates her, then visits her at home, and finally attacks and attempts to bite her at the place where they both work. She pulls out a gun, and Loew begs her to shoot him. Since it is only loaded with blanks, she fires at the floor to scare him off. He eventually overpowers her and attempts to bite her on the neck, ripping her shirt open and knocking her down. He takes the gun and fires it into his mouth, but is not harmed by the blanks.\n\nThinking he has metamorphosed into a vampire, Loew goes out to a club wearing his vampire teeth and moving like the character [[Count Orlok|Orlok]] from the film ''[[Nosferatu]]''. He begins to seduce a woman, but when he gets too grabby she slaps him off, making Loew even more unhinged: he overpowers her and bites her neck, having taken out the fangs and using his real teeth. He then puts the plastic fangs back in. Leaving the club, Loew has a brief, ambiguous encounter with Rachel: she admits to knowing him, but gives the impression that they have not been in contact for a long period. He accuses her of being a vampiress, and is expelled from the club.\n\nAlva wakes up with her shirt ripped open, possibly thinking she was raped, and eventually tells her brother Emilio ([[Bob Lujan]]) about the sexual assault, who is enraged and goes after Loew to seek revenge. Meanwhile, Loew is wandering the streets in a blood-spattered business suit, talking to himself. In a hallucinatory exchange, he tells his therapist that he raped someone and also murdered someone else. Based on a newspaper, the latter appears to be true, as the girl he bit in the club is pronounced dead. As Loew returns to his now-disastrous apartment (which he'd been using as a sort of vampire cave) Alva points out Loew to her brother Emilio, who pursues him inside his home with a tire iron.\n\nIn the midst of an argument with an imaginary romantic interest (supposedly a patient of his psychiatrist) Loew begins to retch again from the blood he had swallowed, and crawls under an upturned sofa, which he sees as his \"coffin\". Alva's brother Emilio finds him and upturns the sofa, and Loew holds a large broken shard of wood to his chest as a makeshift stake, repeating the gesture he had made earlier to strangers on the street when he had asked them to stake and kill him. Alva's brother, in a rage, pushes down on the stake and it pierces Loew's chest. Realizing he has committed a crime, a scared Emilio flees the place. As Loew dies, he envisions the vampiress Rachel smiling at him one last time.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Nicolas Cage]] as Peter Loew\n* [[Mar\u00eda Conchita Alonso]] as Alva Restrepo\n* [[Jennifer Beals]] as Rachel\n* [[Elizabeth Ashley]] as Dr. Glaser\n* [[Kasi Lemmons]] as Jackie\n* [[Bob Lujan]] as Emilio Restrepo\n* [[Jessica Lundy]] as Sharon\n* Johnny Walker as Donald (as John Walker)\n* [[Boris Leskin]] as Fantasy Cabbie\n* [[Michael Knowles (actor)|Michael Knowles]] as Andrew\n* [[John Michael Higgins]] as Ed\n* [[Jodie Markell]] as Joke Girl\n* [[Marc Coppola (actor)|Marc Coppola]] as Joke Guy\n* [[David Hyde Pierce]] as Theater Guy (as David Pierce)\n* [[Amy Stiller]] as Theater Girl\n* [[Christopher Sluka]] as Hanger Out\n\n==Release==\n''Vampire's Kiss'' was released June 2, 1989.

The team moved up to the 2nd division 1986/1987 season, and were on the rise the following year, but it was missed when they lost the qualification against Kristiansand with 1 goal.\n\nAfter winning the 2nd division season 1988/1989, it was clear for the top series. The same season the team also played for the NM finals where the opponent became the arch rival Stavanger Idrettsforening. Viking Handball klubb won the match 21-17 ahead of 5&nbsp;000 spectators.\n\n== Series and end games in Norway ==\nViking Handball has won the series once (the 1997/1998 season), they have 2 silver, and won the NM 4 times (the seasons 1987/1988, 1993/1994, 1996/1997 and 2000/2001).\n\n== Participation international ==\nBest position internationally came when the team reached the semi-finals of the Cup Winner Cup in the 1997/98 season.

Otherwise, Viking has reached the quarterfinals of the EHF Cup and participated in the Champions League.\n\n== == Merging\nThe club has always been independent, but on 17 February 2000 the club entered into a collaboration with [[Stavanger Idrettsforening]] on elite efforts. The teams formed Stavanger Handball and took the logo of Viking Handball Klubb.\n\nThis collaboration came about in an attempt to reach the top of Norwegian handball and stay there. The collaboration began in the youth department, via junior teams, and up to the senior departments. The clubs were still independent, but after the 2008/2009 season (which ended in relegation), it was called to an extraordinary annual meeting 14 February 2009, where it was decided that the collaboration should end when Stavanger Idrettsforening wanted to withdraw.\n\n== The years after Stavanger H\u00e5ndball ==\nThe first year as \"\" New \"Viking Handball\", they won the 1st division over V\u00e5lerenga by 4 points, and moved straight up to the elite series again, where it was 6th place on the first try\n\n2010/2011 - Won 1 division, advanced to the elite\n\n2011/2012 - 9th place in the elite\n\n2012/2013 - Last place in the elite\n\n2013/2014 - Relegated to 1st Division handball for men.\n\n2014/2015 - 3rd place 1st division\n\n2015/2016 - Promotion to the elite\n\n2016/2017 - Last in the elite series and relegated again\n\n2017/2018 - Further down to 2 divisions\n\n2018/2019 - Won 2 Division 3 Division and moved directly into 1 Division again\n\n2019/2020 - 2 place 1 division - There is promotion to the elite with 5 games left to play (as of February 24, 2020).

The collaboration began in the youth department, via junior teams, and up to the senior departments. The clubs were still independent, but after the 2008/2009 season (which ended in relegation), it was called to an extraordinary annual meeting [[14. February]] [[2009]], where it was decided that the collaboration should end when Stavanger Idrettsforening wanted to withdraw.\n\n== The years after Stavanger H\u00e5ndball ==\nThe first year as \"\" New \"Viking Handball\", they won the 1st division over V\u00e5lerenga by 4 points, and moved straight up to the elite series again, where it was 6th place on the first try\n\n2010/2011 - Won 1 division, advanced to the elite\n\n2011/2012 - 9th place in the elite\n\n2012/2013 - Last place in the elite\n\n2013/2014 - Relegated to 1st Division handball for men.\n\n2014/2015 - 3rd place 1st division\n\n2015/2016 - Promotion to the elite\n\n2016/2017 - Last in the elite series and relegated again\n\n2017/2018 - Further down to 2 divisions\n\n2018/2019 - Won 2 Division 3 Division and moved directly into 1 Division again\n\n2019/2020 - 2 place 1 division - There is promotion to the elite with 5 games left to play (as of February 24, 2020).

His works often focus on history, morality, and religion.\n\nHe was born in 1804 in [[Salem, Massachusetts]], to Nathaniel Hathorne and the former Elizabeth Clarke Manning. His ancestors include [[John Hathorne]], the only judge involved in the [[Salem witch trials]] who never repented of his actions. He entered [[Bowdoin College]] in 1821, was elected to [[Phi Beta Kappa]] in 1824,<ref>[http://www.pbk.org/infoview/PBK_InfoView.aspx?t=&id=59 Who Belongs To Phi Beta Kappa] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120103230618/http://www.pbk.org/infoview/PBK_InfoView.aspx?t=&id=59 |date=January 3, 2012 }}, Phi Beta Kappa website, accessed Oct 4, 2009</ref> and graduated in 1825. He published his first work in 1828, the novel ''[[Fanshawe (novel)|Fanshawe]]''; he later tried to suppress it, feeling that it was not equal to the standard of his later work.<ref>{{cite book|last=Hawthorne|first=Nathaniel|title=Fanshawe|year=1828|publisher=Marsh & Capen|location=Boston|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=yVQ4AAAAIAAJ&lpg=PA72}}</ref> He published several short stories in periodicals, which he collected in 1837 as ''[[Twice-Told Tales]]''. The next year, he became engaged to [[Sophia Hawthorne|Sophia Peabody]]. He worked at the [[Boston Custom House]] and joined [[Brook Farm]], a [[Transcendentalism|transcendentalist]] community, before marrying Peabody in 1842. The couple moved to [[The Old Manse]] in [[Concord, Massachusetts]], later moving to Salem, [[the Berkshires]], then to [[The Wayside]] in Concord. ''[[The Scarlet Letter]]'' was published in 1850, followed by a succession of other novels. A political appointment as consul took Hawthorne and family to Europe before their return to Concord in 1860. Hawthorne died on May 19, 1864, and was survived by his wife and their three children.\n\nMuch of Hawthorne's writing centers on [[New England]], many works featuring moral [[metaphor]]s with an anti-[[Puritan]] inspiration. His fiction works are considered part of the [[Romanticism|Romantic movement]] and, more specifically, dark romanticism. His themes often center on the inherent evil and sin of humanity, and his works often have moral messages and deep psychological complexity. His published works include novels, short stories, and a biography of his college friend [[Franklin Pierce]], the 14th [[President of the United States]].\n\n==Biography==\n\n===Early life===\n[[File:Nathaniel Hawthorne.jpg|thumb|right|Portrait of Nathaniel Hawthorne by [[Charles Osgood (artist)|Charles Osgood]], 1841 (Peabody Essex Museum)]]\nNathaniel Hawthorne was born on July 4, 1804, in [[Salem, Massachusetts|Salem]], Massachusetts; [[Nathaniel Hawthorne Birthplace|his birthplace]] is preserved and open to the public.<ref>Haas, Irvin.

The homemade newspaper was written by hand and included essays, poems, and news featuring the young author's adolescent humor.<ref>Miller, 57</ref>\n\nHawthorne's uncle Robert Manning insisted that the boy attend college, despite Hawthorne's protests.<ref name=Edwards>Edwards, Herbert. \"[http://www.hawthorneassoc.com/html/downeast_mag.html Nathaniel Hawthorne in Maine]\", ''Downeast Magazine'', 1962</ref> With the financial support of his uncle, Hawthorne was sent to [[Bowdoin College]] in 1821, partly because of family connections in the area, and also because of its relatively inexpensive tuition rate.<ref>Wineapple, 44\u201345</ref> Hawthorne met future president [[Franklin Pierce]] on the way to Bowdoin, at the stage stop in Portland, and the two became fast friends.<ref name=Edwards/> Once at the school, he also met future poet [[Henry Wadsworth Longfellow]], future congressman [[Jonathan Cilley]], and future naval reformer [[Horatio Bridge]].<ref>Cheever, 99</ref> He graduated with the class of 1825, and later described his college experience to [[Richard Henry Stoddard]]: {{quote|I was educated (as the phrase is) at Bowdoin College.

August 1904.</ref>]]\n\nIn 1836, Hawthorne served as the editor of the ''[[American Magazine of Useful and Entertaining Knowledge]]''. At the time, he boarded with poet [[Thomas Green Fessenden]] on Hancock Street in Beacon Hill in [[Boston]].<ref>Wineapple, 87\u201388</ref> He was offered an appointment as weigher and gauger at the [[Boston Custom House]] at a salary of $1,500 a year, which he accepted on January 17, 1839.<ref>Miller, 169</ref> During his time there, he rented a room from [[George Stillman Hillard]], business partner of [[Charles Sumner]].<ref>Mellow, 169</ref> Hawthorne wrote in the comparative obscurity of what he called his \"owl's nest\" in the family home. As he looked back on this period of his life, he wrote: \"I have not lived, but only dreamed about living.\"<ref>Letter to Longfellow, June 4, 1837.</ref> He contributed short stories to various magazines and annuals, including \"[[Young Goodman Brown]]\" and \"[[The Minister's Black Veil]]\", though none drew major attention to him. [[Horatio Bridge]] offered to cover the risk of collecting these stories in the spring of 1837 into the volume ''[[Twice-Told Tales]]'', which made Hawthorne known locally.<ref>McFarland, 22\u201323</ref>\n\n===Marriage and family===\n[[File:Sophia Peabody Hawthorne.png|thumb|left|Sophia Peabody Hawthorne (1809\u20131871)]]\nWhile at Bowdoin, Hawthorne wagered a bottle of [[Madeira wine]] with his friend Jonathan Cilley that Cilley would get married before Hawthorne did.<ref>Manning Hawthorne, \"Nathaniel Hawthorne at Bowdoin\", ''The New England Quarterly'', Vol. 13, No. 2 (June 1940): 246\u2013279.</ref> By 1836, he had won the bet, but he did not remain a bachelor for life. He had public flirtations with Mary Silsbee and [[Elizabeth Peabody]],<ref>Cheever, 102</ref> then he began pursuing Peabody's sister, [[illustrator]] and [[transcendentalism|transcendentalist]] [[Sophia Hawthorne|Sophia Peabody]]. He joined the                                    transcendentalist [[Utopia]]n community at [[Brook Farm (Boston, Massachusetts)|Brook Farm]] in 1841, not because he agreed with the experiment but because it helped him save money to marry Sophia.<ref>McFarland, 83</ref> He paid a $1,000 deposit and was put in charge of shoveling the hill of manure referred to as \"the Gold Mine\".<ref>Cheever, 104</ref> He left later that year, though his Brook Farm adventure became an inspiration for his novel ''[[The Blithedale Romance]]''.<ref name=\"McFarland, 149\">McFarland, 149</ref> Hawthorne married Sophia Peabody on July 9, 1842, at a ceremony in the Peabody parlor on West Street in Boston.<ref>Wineapple, 160</ref> The couple moved to [[The Old Manse]] in [[Concord, Massachusetts]],<ref>McFarland, 25</ref> where they lived for three years. His neighbor [[Ralph Waldo Emerson]] invited him into his social circle, but Hawthorne was almost pathologically shy and stayed silent at gatherings.<ref>Schreiner, 123</ref> At the Old Manse, Hawthorne wrote most of the tales collected in ''[[Mosses from an Old Manse]]''.<ref>Miller, 246\u2013247</ref>\n[[File:Hawthorne children mmd368 l.jpg|thumb|right|Una, Julian, and Rose ca. 1862]]\nLike Hawthorne, Sophia was a reclusive person. Throughout her early life, she had frequent [[migraine]]s and underwent several experimental medical treatments.<ref>Mellow, 6\u20137</ref> She was mostly bedridden until her sister introduced her to Hawthorne, after which her headaches seem to have abated. The Hawthornes enjoyed a long and happy marriage. He referred to her as his \"Dove\" and wrote that she \"is, in the strictest sense, my sole companion; and I need no other\u2014there is no vacancy in my mind, any more than in my heart ... Thank God that I suffice for her boundless heart!\"<ref>McFarland, 87</ref> Sophia greatly admired her husband's work. She wrote in one of her journals: \n<blockquote>I am always so dazzled and bewildered with the richness, the depth, the&nbsp;... jewels of beauty in his productions that I am always looking forward to a second reading where I can ponder and muse and fully take in the miraculous wealth of thoughts.<ref>January 14, 1851, Journal of Sophia Hawthorne. Berg Collection NY Public Library.</ref></blockquote>\n\nPoet [[William Ellery Channing (poet)|Ellery Channing]] came to the Old Manse for help on the first anniversary of the Hawthornes' marriage. A local teenager named Martha Hunt had drowned herself in the river and Hawthorne's boat ''Pond Lily'' was needed to find her body. Hawthorne helped recover the corpse, which he described as \"a spectacle of such perfect horror&nbsp;... She was the very image of death-agony\".<ref>Schreiner, 116\u2013117</ref> The incident later inspired a scene in his novel ''The Blithedale Romance''.\n\nThe Hawthornes had three children. Their first was daughter Una, born March 3, 1844; her name was a reference to ''[[The Faerie Queene]]'', to the displeasure of family members.<ref>McFarland, 97</ref> Hawthorne wrote to a friend, \"I find it a very sober and serious kind of happiness that springs from the birth of a child&nbsp;... There is no escaping it any longer. I have business on earth now, and must look about me for the means of doing it.\"<ref>Schreiner, 119</ref> In October 1845, the Hawthornes moved to Salem.<ref name=\"Reynolds, 10\">Reynolds, 10</ref> In 1846, their son [[Julian Hawthorne|Julian]] was born. Hawthorne wrote to his sister Louisa on June 22, 1846: \"A small troglodyte made his appearance here at ten minutes to six o'clock this morning, who claimed to be your nephew.\"<ref>Mellow, 273</ref> Daughter [[Mother Mary Alphonsa|Rose]] was born in May 1851, and Hawthorne called her his \"autumnal flower\".<ref>Miller, 343\u2013344</ref>\n\n===Middle years===\n[[File:Nathaniel Hawthorne by Whipple c1848.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Daguerrotype]] of Hawthorne, [[John Adams Whipple|Whipple & Black]], 1848]]\nIn April 1846, Hawthorne was officially appointed the Surveyor for the District of Salem and Beverly and Inspector of the Revenue for the Port of Salem at an annual salary of $1,200.<ref>Miller, 242</ref> He had difficulty writing during this period, as he admitted to Longfellow:\n\n<blockquote>I am trying to resume my pen&nbsp;... Whenever I sit alone, or walk alone, I find myself dreaming about stories, as of old; but these forenoons in the Custom House undo all that the afternoons and evenings have done. I should be happier if I could write.<ref>Miller, 265</ref></blockquote>\n\nThis employment, like his earlier appointment to the custom house in Boston, was vulnerable to the politics of the [[spoils system]]. Hawthorne was a Democrat and lost this job due to the change of administration in Washington after the presidential election of 1848. He wrote a letter of protest to the ''Boston Daily Advertiser'' which was attacked by the [[Whig Party (United States)|Whigs]] and supported by the Democrats, making Hawthorne's dismissal a much-talked about event in New England.<ref>Cheever, 179</ref> He was deeply affected by the death of his mother in late July, calling it \"the darkest hour I ever lived\".<ref>Cheever, 180</ref> He was appointed the corresponding secretary of the Salem Lyceum in 1848. Guests who came to speak that season included Emerson, Thoreau, [[Louis Agassiz]], and [[Theodore Parker]].<ref>Miller, 264\u2013265</ref>\n\nHawthorne returned to writing and published ''[[The Scarlet Letter]]'' in mid-March 1850,<ref>Miller, 300</ref> including a preface that refers to his three-year tenure in the Custom House and makes several allusions to local politicians\u2014who did not appreciate their treatment.<ref>Mellow, 316</ref> It was one of the first mass-produced books in America, selling 2,500 volumes within ten days and earning Hawthorne $1,500 over 14 years.<ref name=McFarland136>McFarland, 136</ref> The book was pirated by booksellers in London{{Citation needed|date=September 2010}} and became a best-seller in the United States;<ref>Cheever, 181</ref> it initiated his most lucrative period as a writer.<ref name=McFarland136/> Hawthorne's friend [[Edwin Percy Whipple]] objected to the novel's \"morbid intensity\" and its dense psychological details, writing that the book \"is therefore apt to become, like Hawthorne, too painfully anatomical in his exhibition of them\",<ref>Miller, 301\u2013302</ref> though 20th-century writer [[D.&nbsp;H. Lawrence]] said that there could be no more perfect work of the American imagination than ''The Scarlet Letter''.<ref>Miller, 284</ref>\n\nHawthorne and his family moved to a small red farmhouse near [[Lenox, Massachusetts]], at the end of March 1850.<ref>Miller, 274</ref> He became friends with [[Herman Melville]] beginning on August 5, 1850, when the authors met at a picnic hosted by a mutual friend.<ref>Cheever, 96</ref> Melville had just read Hawthorne's short story collection ''[[Mosses from an Old Manse]]'', and his unsigned review of the collection was printed in ''[[The Literary World (New York City)|The Literary World]]'' on August 17 and August 24 titled \"Hawthorne and His Mosses\".<ref>Miller, 312</ref> Melville wrote that these stories revealed a dark side to Hawthorne, \"shrouded in blackness, ten times black\".<ref name=Mellow335>Mellow, 335</ref> He was composing his novel ''[[Moby-Dick]]'' at the time,<ref name=Mellow335/> and dedicated the work in 1851 to Hawthorne: \"In token of my admiration for his genius, this book is inscribed to Nathaniel Hawthorne.\"<ref>Mellow, 382</ref>\n\nHawthorne's time in the [[Berkshires]] was very productive.<ref name=Wright93>Wright, John Hardy. ''Hawthorne's Haunts in New England''.

Ticknor]] to Washington, D.C., where he met [[Abraham Lincoln]] and other notable figures. He wrote about his experiences in the essay \"[[Chiefly About War Matters]]\" in 1862.\n\nFailing health prevented him from completing several more romance novels.

''Literary Movements for Students'', Vol. 1. Detroit: Thompson Gale, 2002: 319. {{ISBN|0-7876-6517-7}}</ref>\n\nHawthorne was predominantly a short story writer in his early career. Upon publishing ''Twice-Told Tales'', however, he noted, \"I do not think much of them,\" and he expected little response from the public.<ref>Miller, 104</ref> His four major [[Novel#19th century novels|romances]] were written between 1850 and 1860: ''[[The Scarlet Letter]]'' (1850), ''[[The House of the Seven Gables]]'' (1851), ''[[The Blithedale Romance]]'' (1852) and ''[[The Marble Faun]]'' (1860). Another novel-length romance, ''[[Fanshawe (novel)|Fanshawe]]'', was published anonymously in 1828. Hawthorne defined a romance as being radically different from a novel by not being concerned with the possible or probable course of ordinary experience.<ref>Porte, 95</ref> In the preface to ''The House of the Seven Gables'', Hawthorne describes his romance-writing as using \"atmospherical medium as to bring out or mellow the lights and deepen and enrich the shadows of the picture\".<ref>Wineapple, 237</ref> The picture, Daniel Hoffman found, was one of \"the primitive energies of fecundity and creation.\"<ref>Hoffman, 356</ref>\n\nCritics have applied [[Feminist literary criticism|feminist perspectives]] and [[Historicism|historicist approaches]] to Hawthorne's depictions of women. Feminist scholars are interested particularly in [[Hester Prynne]]: they recognize that while she herself could not be the \"destined prophetess\" of the future, the \"angel and apostle of the coming revelation\" must nevertheless \"be a woman.\" <ref>''The Scarlet Letter'' Ch XXIV \"Conclusion\"</ref>  [[Camille Paglia]] saw Hester as mystical, \"a wandering goddess still bearing the mark of her Asiatic origins&nbsp;... moving serenely in the magic circle of her sexual nature\".<ref>Paglia, ''Sexual Personae'', 581, 583</ref> Lauren Berlant termed  Hester \"the citizen as woman [personifying] love as a quality of the body that contains the purest light of nature,\" her resulting \"traitorous political theory\" a \"Female Symbolic\" literalization of futile Puritan metaphors.<ref>Berlant, ''The Anatomy of National Fantasy'', 94, 148, 175</ref> Historicists view Hester as a [[protofeminist]] and avatar of the self-reliance and responsibility that led to women's suffrage and reproductive emancipation. Anthony Splendora found her literary genealogy among other archetypally fallen but redeemed women, both historic and mythic. As examples, he offers [[Cupid and Psyche|Psyche]] of ancient legend; [[H\u00e9lo\u00efse (abbess)|Heloise]] of twelfth-century France's tragedy involving world-renowned philosopher [[Peter Abelard]]; [[Anne Hutchinson]] (America's first heretic, circa 1636), and Hawthorne family friend [[Margaret Fuller]].<ref>Splendora, \"Psyche and Hester\", 2, 5, 18</ref> In Hester's first appearance, Hawthorne likens her, \"infant at her bosom\", to Mary, Mother of Jesus, \"the image of Divine Maternity\". In her study of Victorian literature, in which such \"galvanic outcasts\" as Hester feature prominently, [[Nina Auerbach]] went so far as to name Hester's fall and subsequent redemption, \"the novel's one unequivocally religious activity\".<ref>Auerbach, ''Woman and the Demon'', 150, 166</ref> Regarding Hester as a deity figure, Meredith A. Powers found in Hester's characterization \"the earliest in American fiction that the archetypal Goddess appears quite graphically,\" like a Goddess \"not the wife of traditional marriage, permanently subject to a male overlord\"; Powers noted \"her syncretism, her flexibility, her inherent ability to alter and so avoid the defeat of secondary status in a goal-oriented civilization\".<ref>Powers, ''The Heroine in Western Literature,''  144</ref>\n\nAside from Hester Prynne, the model women of Hawthorne's other novels\u2014from Ellen Langton of ''Fanshawe'' to Zenobia and Priscilla of ''The Blithedale Romance,'' Hilda and Miriam of ''The Marble Faun'' and Phoebe and Hepzibah of ''The House of the Seven Gables''\u2014are more fully realized than his male characters, who merely orbit them.<ref>Splendora, \"Psyche and Hester\", 12</ref> This observation is equally true of his short-stories, in which central females serve as allegorical figures: Rappaccini's beautiful but life-altering, garden-bound, daughter; almost-perfect Georgiana of \"The Birthmark\"; the sinned-against (abandoned) Ester of \"Ethan Brand\"; and goodwife Faith Brown, linchpin of Young Goodman Brown's very belief in God. \"My Faith is gone!\" Brown exclaims in despair upon seeing his wife at the Witches' Sabbath.{{citation needed|date=May 2016}}. Perhaps the most sweeping statement of Hawthorne's impetus comes from Mark Van Doren: \"Somewhere, if not in the New England of his time, Hawthorne unearthed the image of a goddess supreme in beauty and power.\"<ref>Van Doren 19</ref>\n\nHawthorne also wrote nonfiction. In 2008, the [[Library of America]] selected Hawthorne's \"A show of wax-figures\" for inclusion in its two-century retrospective of American True Crime.<ref>[https://www.loa.org/books/289-true-crime-an-american-anthology True Crime: An American Anthology], Library of America website, accessed Jan 30, 2018</ref>\n\n===Criticism===\nIn \"Hawthorne and His Mosses\", Herman Melville wrote a passionate argument for Hawthorne to be among the burgeoning American literary canon, \"He is one of the new, and far better generation of your writers.\" In this review of ''Mosses from an Old Manse'', Melville describes an affinity for Hawthorne that would only increase: \"I feel that this Hawthorne has dropped germinous seeds into my soul. He expands and deepens down, the more I contemplate him; and further, and further, shoots his strong New-England roots into the hot soil of my Southern soul.\"{{citation needed|date=October 2019}} [[Edgar Allan Poe]] wrote important reviews of both ''Twice-Told Tales'' and ''Mosses from an Old Manse''. Poe's assessment was partly informed by his contempt of allegory and moral tales, and his chronic accusations of plagiarism, though he admitted, \n\n<blockquote>The style of Mr. Hawthorne is purity itself. His tone is singularly effective\u2014wild, plaintive, thoughtful, and in full accordance with his themes&nbsp;... We look upon him as one of the few men of indisputable genius to whom our country has as yet given birth.<ref>McFarland, 88\u201389</ref></blockquote> [[Ralph Waldo Emerson]] wrote, \"Nathaniel Hawthorne's reputation as a writer is a very pleasing fact, because his writing is not good for anything, and this is a tribute to the man.\"<ref>Nelson, Randy F. (editor). ''The Almanac of American Letters''. Los Altos, California: William Kaufmann, Inc., 1981: 150. {{ISBN|0-86576-008-X}}.</ref> [[Henry James]] praised Hawthorne, saying, \"The fine thing in Hawthorne is that he cared for the deeper psychology, and that, in his way, he tried to become familiar with it.\"<ref>Porte, 97</ref> Poet [[John Greenleaf Whittier]] wrote that he admired the \"weird and subtle beauty\" in Hawthorne's tales.<ref>Woodwell, Roland H. ''John Greenleaf Whittier: A Biography''. Haverhill, Massachusetts: Trustees of the John Greenleaf Whittier Homestead, 1985: 293.</ref> [[Evert Augustus Duyckinck]] said of Hawthorne, \"Of the American writers destined to live, he is the most original, the one least indebted to foreign models or literary precedents of any kind.\"<ref>McFarland, 88</ref>\n\nContemporary response to Hawthorne's work praised his sentimentality and moral purity while more modern evaluations focus on the dark psychological complexity.<ref>Person, Leland S. \"Bibliographical Essay: Hawthorne and History\", collected in ''A Historical Guide to Nathaniel Hawthorne''.

He published his first work in 1828, the novel ''[[Fanshawe (novel)|Fanshawe]]''; he later tried to suppress it, feeling that it was not equal to the standard of his later work.<ref>{{cite book|last=Hawthorne|first=Nathaniel|title=Fanshawe|year=1828|publisher=Marsh & Capen|location=Boston|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=yVQ4AAAAIAAJ&lpg=PA72}}</ref> He published several short stories in periodicals, which he collected in 1837 as ''[[Twice-Told Tales]]''. The next year, he became engaged to [[Sophia Hawthorne|Sophia Peabody]]. He worked at the [[Boston Custom House]] and joined [[Brook Farm]], a [[Transcendentalism|transcendentalist]] community, before marrying Peabody in 1842. The couple moved to [[The Old Manse]] in [[Concord, Massachusetts]], later moving to Salem, [[the Berkshires]], then to [[The Wayside]] in Concord. ''[[The Scarlet Letter]]'' was published in 1850, followed by a succession of other novels. A political appointment as consul took Hawthorne and family to Europe before their return to Concord in 1860. Hawthorne died on May 19, 1864, and was survived by his wife and their three children.\n\nMuch of Hawthorne's writing centers on [[New England]], many works featuring moral [[metaphor]]s with an anti-[[Puritan]] inspiration. His fiction works are considered part of the [[Romanticism|Romantic movement]] and, more specifically, dark romanticism. His themes often center on the inherent evil and sin of humanity, and his works often have moral messages and deep psychological complexity. His published works include novels, short stories, and a biography of his college friend [[Franklin Pierce]], the 14th [[President of the United States]].\n\n==Biography==\n\n===Early life===\n[[File:Nathaniel Hawthorne.jpg|thumb|right|Portrait of Nathaniel Hawthorne by [[Charles Osgood (artist)|Charles Osgood]], 1841 (Peabody Essex Museum)]]\nNathaniel Hawthorne was born on July 4, 1804, in [[Salem, Massachusetts|Salem]], Massachusetts; [[Nathaniel Hawthorne Birthplace|his birthplace]] is preserved and open to the public.<ref>Haas, Irvin.

At the time, he boarded with poet [[Thomas Green Fessenden]] on Hancock Street in Beacon Hill in [[Boston]].<ref>Wineapple, 87\u201388</ref> He was offered an appointment as weigher and gauger at the [[Boston Custom House]] at a salary of $1,500 a year, which he accepted on January 17, 1839.<ref>Miller, 169</ref> During his time there, he rented a room from [[George Stillman Hillard]], business partner of [[Charles Sumner]].<ref>Mellow, 169</ref> Hawthorne wrote in the comparative obscurity of what he called his \"owl's nest\" in the family home.

His neighbor [[Ralph Waldo Emerson]] invited him into his social circle, but Hawthorne was almost pathologically shy and stayed silent at gatherings.<ref>Schreiner, 123</ref> At the Old Manse, Hawthorne wrote most of the tales collected in ''[[Mosses from an Old Manse]]''.<ref>Miller, 246\u2013247</ref>\n[[File:Hawthorne children mmd368 l.jpg|thumb|right|Una, Julian, and Rose ca. 1862]]\nLike Hawthorne, Sophia was a reclusive person. Throughout her early life, she had frequent [[migraine]]s and underwent several experimental medical treatments.<ref>Mellow, 6\u20137</ref> She was mostly bedridden until her sister introduced her to Hawthorne, after which her headaches seem to have abated. The Hawthornes enjoyed a long and happy marriage. He referred to her as his \"Dove\" and wrote that she \"is, in the strictest sense, my sole companion; and I need no other\u2014there is no vacancy in my mind, any more than in my heart ... Thank God that I suffice for her boundless heart!\"<ref>McFarland, 87</ref> Sophia greatly admired her husband's work. She wrote in one of her journals: \n<blockquote>I am always so dazzled and bewildered with the richness, the depth, the&nbsp;... jewels of beauty in his productions that I am always looking forward to a second reading where I can ponder and muse and fully take in the miraculous wealth of thoughts.<ref>January 14, 1851, Journal of Sophia Hawthorne. Berg Collection NY Public Library.</ref></blockquote>\n\nPoet [[William Ellery Channing (poet)|Ellery Channing]] came to the Old Manse for help on the first anniversary of the Hawthornes' marriage. A local teenager named Martha Hunt had drowned herself in the river and Hawthorne's boat ''Pond Lily'' was needed to find her body. Hawthorne helped recover the corpse, which he described as \"a spectacle of such perfect horror&nbsp;... She was the very image of death-agony\".<ref>Schreiner, 116\u2013117</ref> The incident later inspired a scene in his novel ''The Blithedale Romance''.\n\nThe Hawthornes had three children. Their first was daughter Una, born March 3, 1844; her name was a reference to ''[[The Faerie Queene]]'', to the displeasure of family members.<ref>McFarland, 97</ref> Hawthorne wrote to a friend, \"I find it a very sober and serious kind of happiness that springs from the birth of a child&nbsp;... There is no escaping it any longer. I have business on earth now, and must look about me for the means of doing it.\"<ref>Schreiner, 119</ref> In October 1845, the Hawthornes moved to Salem.<ref name=\"Reynolds, 10\">Reynolds, 10</ref> In 1846, their son [[Julian Hawthorne|Julian]] was born.

Whenever I sit alone, or walk alone, I find myself dreaming about stories, as of old; but these forenoons in the Custom House undo all that the afternoons and evenings have done. I should be happier if I could write.<ref>Miller, 265</ref></blockquote>\n\nThis employment, like his earlier appointment to the custom house in Boston, was vulnerable to the politics of the [[spoils system]]. Hawthorne was a Democrat and lost this job due to the change of administration in Washington after the presidential election of 1848. He wrote a letter of protest to the ''Boston Daily Advertiser'' which was attacked by the [[Whig Party (United States)|Whigs]] and supported by the Democrats, making Hawthorne's dismissal a much-talked about event in New England.<ref>Cheever, 179</ref> He was deeply affected by the death of his mother in late July, calling it \"the darkest hour I ever lived\".<ref>Cheever, 180</ref> He was appointed the corresponding secretary of the Salem Lyceum in 1848. Guests who came to speak that season included Emerson, Thoreau, [[Louis Agassiz]], and [[Theodore Parker]].<ref>Miller, 264\u2013265</ref>\n\nHawthorne returned to writing and published ''[[The Scarlet Letter]]'' in mid-March 1850,<ref>Miller, 300</ref> including a preface that refers to his three-year tenure in the Custom House and makes several allusions to local politicians\u2014who did not appreciate their treatment.<ref>Mellow, 316</ref> It was one of the first mass-produced books in America, selling 2,500 volumes within ten days and earning Hawthorne $1,500 over 14 years.<ref name=McFarland136>McFarland, 136</ref> The book was pirated by booksellers in London{{Citation needed|date=September 2010}} and became a best-seller in the United States;<ref>Cheever, 181</ref> it initiated his most lucrative period as a writer.<ref name=McFarland136/> Hawthorne's friend [[Edwin Percy Whipple]] objected to the novel's \"morbid intensity\" and its dense psychological details, writing that the book \"is therefore apt to become, like Hawthorne, too painfully anatomical in his exhibition of them\",<ref>Miller, 301\u2013302</ref> though 20th-century writer [[D.&nbsp;H.

Upon publishing ''Twice-Told Tales'', however, he noted, \"I do not think much of them,\" and he expected little response from the public.<ref>Miller, 104</ref> His four major [[Novel#19th century novels|romances]] were written between 1850 and 1860: ''[[The Scarlet Letter]]'' (1850), ''[[The House of the Seven Gables]]'' (1851), ''[[The Blithedale Romance]]'' (1852) and ''[[The Marble Faun]]'' (1860). Another novel-length romance, ''[[Fanshawe (novel)|Fanshawe]]'', was published anonymously in 1828. Hawthorne defined a romance as being radically different from a novel by not being concerned with the possible or probable course of ordinary experience.<ref>Porte, 95</ref> In the preface to ''The House of the Seven Gables'', Hawthorne describes his romance-writing as using \"atmospherical medium as to bring out or mellow the lights and deepen and enrich the shadows of the picture\".<ref>Wineapple, 237</ref> The picture, Daniel Hoffman found, was one of \"the primitive energies of fecundity and creation.\"<ref>Hoffman, 356</ref>\n\nCritics have applied [[Feminist literary criticism|feminist perspectives]] and [[Historicism|historicist approaches]] to Hawthorne's depictions of women. Feminist scholars are interested particularly in [[Hester Prynne]]: they recognize that while she herself could not be the \"destined prophetess\" of the future, the \"angel and apostle of the coming revelation\" must nevertheless \"be a woman.\" <ref>''The Scarlet Letter'' Ch XXIV \"Conclusion\"</ref>  [[Camille Paglia]] saw Hester as mystical, \"a wandering goddess still bearing the mark of her Asiatic origins&nbsp;... moving serenely in the magic circle of her sexual nature\".<ref>Paglia, ''Sexual Personae'', 581, 583</ref> Lauren Berlant termed  Hester \"the citizen as woman [personifying] love as a quality of the body that contains the purest light of nature,\" her resulting \"traitorous political theory\" a \"Female Symbolic\" literalization of futile Puritan metaphors.<ref>Berlant, ''The Anatomy of National Fantasy'', 94, 148, 175</ref> Historicists view Hester as a [[protofeminist]] and avatar of the self-reliance and responsibility that led to women's suffrage and reproductive emancipation. Anthony Splendora found her literary genealogy among other archetypally fallen but redeemed women, both historic and mythic. As examples, he offers [[Cupid and Psyche|Psyche]] of ancient legend; [[H\u00e9lo\u00efse (abbess)|Heloise]] of twelfth-century France's tragedy involving world-renowned philosopher [[Peter Abelard]]; [[Anne Hutchinson]] (America's first heretic, circa 1636), and Hawthorne family friend [[Margaret Fuller]].<ref>Splendora, \"Psyche and Hester\", 2, 5, 18</ref> In Hester's first appearance, Hawthorne likens her, \"infant at her bosom\", to Mary, Mother of Jesus, \"the image of Divine Maternity\". In her study of Victorian literature, in which such \"galvanic outcasts\" as Hester feature prominently, [[Nina Auerbach]] went so far as to name Hester's fall and subsequent redemption, \"the novel's one unequivocally religious activity\".<ref>Auerbach, ''Woman and the Demon'', 150, 166</ref> Regarding Hester as a deity figure, Meredith A. Powers found in Hester's characterization \"the earliest in American fiction that the archetypal Goddess appears quite graphically,\" like a Goddess \"not the wife of traditional marriage, permanently subject to a male overlord\"; Powers noted \"her syncretism, her flexibility, her inherent ability to alter and so avoid the defeat of secondary status in a goal-oriented civilization\".<ref>Powers, ''The Heroine in Western Literature,''  144</ref>\n\nAside from Hester Prynne, the model women of Hawthorne's other novels\u2014from Ellen Langton of ''Fanshawe'' to Zenobia and Priscilla of ''The Blithedale Romance,'' Hilda and Miriam of ''The Marble Faun'' and Phoebe and Hepzibah of ''The House of the Seven Gables''\u2014are more fully realized than his male characters, who merely orbit them.<ref>Splendora, \"Psyche and Hester\", 12</ref> This observation is equally true of his short-stories, in which central females serve as allegorical figures: Rappaccini's beautiful but life-altering, garden-bound, daughter; almost-perfect Georgiana of \"The Birthmark\"; the sinned-against (abandoned) Ester of \"Ethan Brand\"; and goodwife Faith Brown, linchpin of Young Goodman Brown's very belief in God. \"My Faith is gone!\" Brown exclaims in despair upon seeing his wife at the Witches' Sabbath.{{citation needed|date=May 2016}}. Perhaps the most sweeping statement of Hawthorne's impetus comes from Mark Van Doren: \"Somewhere, if not in the New England of his time, Hawthorne unearthed the image of a goddess supreme in beauty and power.\"<ref>Van Doren 19</ref>\n\nHawthorne also wrote nonfiction. In 2008, the [[Library of America]] selected Hawthorne's \"A show of wax-figures\" for inclusion in its two-century retrospective of American True Crime.<ref>[https://www.loa.org/books/289-true-crime-an-american-anthology True Crime: An American Anthology], Library of America website, accessed Jan 30, 2018</ref>\n\n===Criticism===\nIn \"Hawthorne and His Mosses\", Herman Melville wrote a passionate argument for Hawthorne to be among the burgeoning American literary canon, \"He is one of the new, and far better generation of your writers.\" In this review of ''Mosses from an Old Manse'', Melville describes an affinity for Hawthorne that would only increase: \"I feel that this Hawthorne has dropped germinous seeds into my soul. He expands and deepens down, the more I contemplate him; and further, and further, shoots his strong New-England roots into the hot soil of my Southern soul.\"{{citation needed|date=October 2019}} [[Edgar Allan Poe]] wrote important reviews of both ''Twice-Told Tales'' and ''Mosses from an Old Manse''. Poe's assessment was partly informed by his contempt of allegory and moral tales, and his chronic accusations of plagiarism, though he admitted, \n\n<blockquote>The style of Mr. Hawthorne is purity itself. His tone is singularly effective\u2014wild, plaintive, thoughtful, and in full accordance with his themes&nbsp;... We look upon him as one of the few men of indisputable genius to whom our country has as yet given birth.<ref>McFarland, 88\u201389</ref></blockquote> [[Ralph Waldo Emerson]] wrote, \"Nathaniel Hawthorne's reputation as a writer is a very pleasing fact, because his writing is not good for anything, and this is a tribute to the man.\"<ref>Nelson, Randy F. (editor). ''The Almanac of American Letters''. Los Altos, California: William Kaufmann, Inc., 1981: 150. {{ISBN|0-86576-008-X}}.</ref> [[Henry James]] praised Hawthorne, saying, \"The fine thing in Hawthorne is that he cared for the deeper psychology, and that, in his way, he tried to become familiar with it.\"<ref>Porte, 97</ref> Poet [[John Greenleaf Whittier]] wrote that he admired the \"weird and subtle beauty\" in Hawthorne's tales.<ref>Woodwell, Roland H. ''John Greenleaf Whittier: A Biography''. Haverhill, Massachusetts: Trustees of the John Greenleaf Whittier Homestead, 1985: 293.</ref> [[Evert Augustus Duyckinck]] said of Hawthorne, \"Of the American writers destined to live, he is the most original, the one least indebted to foreign models or literary precedents of any kind.\"<ref>McFarland, 88</ref>\n\nContemporary response to Hawthorne's work praised his sentimentality and moral purity while more modern evaluations focus on the dark psychological complexity.<ref>Person, Leland S. \"Bibliographical Essay: Hawthorne and History\", collected in ''A Historical Guide to Nathaniel Hawthorne''.
