Most of the show alternates between [[Aerobatic maneuver|maneuver]]s performed by the Diamond Formation and those performed by the Solos. The Diamond, in tight formation and usually at lower speeds (400&nbsp;mph), performs maneuvers such as formation loops, rolls, and transitions from one formation to another. The Solos showcase the high performance capabilities of their individual aircraft through the execution of high-speed passes, slow passes, fast rolls, slow rolls, and very tight turns. The highest speed flown during an air show is 700&nbsp;mph (just under Mach 1) and the lowest speed is 120&nbsp;mph.<ref name=\"Blueangels.navy.mil\" /> Some of the maneuvers include both solo aircraft performing at once, such as opposing passes (toward each other in what appears to be a collision course) and mirror formations (back-to-back, belly-to-belly, or wingtip-to-wingtip, with one jet flying inverted). The Solos join the Diamond Formation near the end of the show for a number of maneuvers in the [[Delta Formation]].\n\nThe parameters of each show must be tailored in accordance with local weather conditions at showtime: in clear weather the ''high'' show is performed; in overcast conditions a ''low'' show is performed, and in limited visibility (weather permitting) the ''flat'' show is presented.

The demonstration pilots and narrator are made up of Navy and USMC [[Naval Aviator]]s. Pilots serve two to three years,<ref name=\"Blueangels.navy.mil\" /> and position assignments are made according to team needs, pilot experience levels, and career considerations for members. Other officers in the squadron include a [[Naval Flight Officer]] who serves as the Events Coordinator, three USMC C-130 pilots, an Executive Officer, a Maintenance Officer, a Supply Officer, a Public Affairs Officer, an Administrative Officer, and a [[Flight Surgeon]]. Enlisted members range from E-4 to E-9 and perform all maintenance, administrative, and support functions. They serve three to four years in the squadron.<ref name=\"Blueangels.navy.mil\" /> After serving with the squadron, members return to fleet assignments.\n\nThe officer selection process requires pilots and support officers (flight surgeon, events coordinator, maintenance officer, supply officer, and public affairs officer) wishing to become Blue Angels to apply formally via their chain-of-command, with a personal statement, letters of recommendation, and flight records. Navy and Marine Corps F/A-18 demonstration pilots and naval flight officers are required to have a minimum of 1,250 tactical jet hours and be carrier-qualified. Marine Corps C-130 demonstration pilots are required to have 1,200 flight hours and be an aircraft commander.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://archives.gosportpensacola.com/gosport-03-02-2012.pdf |title=Gosport article, March 02, 2012, \"Blue Angels Seek Officer Applicants\", page 2 |publisher=Gosport NAS Pensacola Base Newspaper}}{{dead link|date=November 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes}}</ref>\n\nApplicants \"rush\" the team at one or more airshows, paid out of their own finances, and sit in on team briefs, post-show activities, and social events.

The No.{{nbsp}}7 pilot narrates for a year, and then typically flies Opposing and then Lead Solo the following two years, respectively. The No.{{nbsp}}3 pilot moves to the No.{{nbsp}}4 (slot) position for his second year.

During winter training, the pilots fly two practice sessions per day, six days a week, to fly the 120 training missions needed to perform the demonstration safely. Separation between the formation of aircraft and their maneuver altitude is gradually reduced over the course of about two months in January and February. The team then returns to their home base in [[Pensacola]], Florida, in March, and continues to practice throughout the show season. A typical week during the season has practices at NAS Pensacola on Tuesday and Wednesday mornings. The team then flies to its show venue for the upcoming weekend on Thursday, conducting \"circle and arrival\" orientation maneuvers upon arrival. The team flies a \"practice\" airshow at the show site on Friday. This show is attended by invited guests but is often open to the general public. The main airshows are conducted on Saturdays and Sundays, with the team returning home to NAS Pensacola on Sunday evenings after the show. Monday is an off day for the Blues' demonstration pilots and road crew. Extensive aircraft maintenance is performed on Sunday evening and Monday by maintenance team members.\n\nPilots maneuver the flight stick with their right hand and operate the throttle with their left. They do not wear [[G-suit]]s because the air bladders inside repeatedly deflate and inflate, interfering with that stability. To prevent blood from pooling in their legs, Blue Angel pilots have developed a method for tensing their muscles to prevent blood from pooling in their lower extremities, possibly rendering them unconscious.<ref name=\"ba_faq\">{{cite web|url=http://www.blueangels.navy.mil/show/faq.aspx|title=Blue Angels Frequently Asked Questions|publisher=United States Navy|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120404171459/http://www.blueangels.navy.mil/show/faq.aspx|archivedate=4 April 2012|url-status=dead|accessdate=3 March 2012}}</ref>\n\n==History==\n===Overview===\n\n[[File:Blue Angels Vinage Insignia.JPG|thumb|upright=0.8|The original team insignia]]\n\nThe Blue Angels were originally formed in April 1946 as the ''Navy Flight Exhibition Team''.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://blueangelsassociation.org/flight-teams/ |title=Flight Teams, 1946 |publisher=Blue Angels Association |accessdate=17 March 2019}}</ref>\n\nThe Flight Exhibition Team was first introduced as the ''Blue Angels'' during an air show in July 1946.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://aerobaticteams.net/en/resources/i39/Blue-Angels-History.html |title=Blue Angels History |publisher=Aerobatic Teams |accessdate=12 March 2019}}</ref>\n\nThe first Blue Angels demonstration aircraft were navy blue (nearly black) with gold lettering.

Mel Cassidy, Left Wing]]\n\nThe Blue Angels were established as a Navy flight exhibition team on 24 April 1946 by order of Chief of Naval Operations [[Admiral Chester Nimitz]] to generate greater public support of naval aviation. To boost Navy morale, demonstrate naval air power, and maintain public interest in naval aviation, an underlying mission was to help the Navy generate public and political support for a larger allocation of the shrinking defense budget. Rear Admiral [[Ralph E. Davison|Ralph Davison]] personally selected [[Lieutenant Commander]] [[Roy Marlin Voris|Roy Marlin \"Butch\" Voris]], a World War II [[fighter ace]], to assemble and train a flight demonstration team, naming him Officer-in-Charge and Flight Leader. Voris selected three fellow instructors to join him (Lt. Maurice \"Wick\" Wickendoll, Lt. Mel Cassidy, and Lt. Cmdr. Lloyd Barnard, veterans of the War in the Pacific), and they spent countless hours developing the show. The group perfected its initial maneuvers in secret over the Florida [[Everglades]] so that, in Voris' words, \"if anything happened, just the alligators would know\". The first four pilots and those after them, were and are some of the best and most experienced aviators in the Navy.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.blueangels.org/NANews/Articles/Aug55/Aug55.htm |title=Blue Angels Article, August 1955 |publisher=Naval Aviation News |accessdate=4 March 2019}}</ref>\n[[File:F8F-1 Blue Angels 1946.jpg|thumb|right|[[Grumman F8F Bearcat]]s in \"diamond\" formation, 1947]]\n\nThe team's first demonstration with [[Grumman F6F-5 Hellcat]] aircraft took place before Navy officials on 10 May 1946, and was met with enthusiastic approval. The Blue Angels performed their first public flight demonstration from their first training base and team headquarters at [[Naval Air Station Jacksonville|Naval Air Station (NAS) Jacksonville]], Florida, on 15 and 16 June 1946,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.blueangels.org/NANews/Articles/Aug55/Aug55.htm |title=Blue Angels Article, August 1955 |publisher=Naval Aviation News |accessdate=4 March 2019}}</ref> with three F6F-5 Hellcats (a fourth F6F-5 was held in reserve). On 15 June, Voris led the three Hellcats (numbered 1\u20133), specially modified to reduce weight and painted sea blue with gold leaf trim, through their inaugural 15-minute-long performance.<ref name=\"OFFICIAL\" /> The team employed a [[North American T-6 Texan|North American SNJ Texan]], painted and configured to simulate a [[Japanese Zero]], to simulate aerial combat. This aircraft was later painted yellow and dubbed the \"Beetle Bomb\". This aircraft is said to have been inspired by one of the [[Spike Jones#Murdering the Classics|Spike Jones]]' ''Murdering the Classics'' series of musical satires, set to the tune (in part) of the [[William Tell Overture]] as a thoroughbred horse race scene, with \"Beetle Bomb\" being the \"trailing horse\" in the lyrics.\n\nThe team thrilled spectators with low-flying maneuvers performed in tight formations, and (according to Voris) by \"keeping something in front of the crowds at all times. My objective was to beat the Army Air Corps. If we did that, we'd get all the other side issues. I felt that if we weren't the best, it would be my naval career.\" The Blue Angels' first public demonstration also netted the team its first trophy, which sits on display at the team's current home at [[Naval Air Station Pensacola|NAS Pensacola]]. During an air show at [[Omaha, Nebraska]] on 19\u201321 July 1946, the Navy Flight Exhibition Team was introduced as the ''Blue Angels''.<ref name=\"Blue Angels History\">{{cite web |url=https://aerobaticteams.net/en/resources/i39/Blue-Angels-History.html |title=Blue Angels History |publisher=Aerobatic Teams |accessdate=6 March 2019}}</ref> The name had originated through a suggestion by Right Wing Pilot Lt. Maurice \"Wick\" Wickendoll, after he had read about the Blue Angel nightclub in ''[[The New Yorker]]'' magazine. After ten appearances with the Hellcats, the Hellcats were replaced by the lighter, faster, and more powerful F8F-1 Bearcats on 25 August.<ref name=\"Blue Angels History\"/> By the end of the year the team consisted of four Bearcats numbered 1\u20134 on the tail sections.\n\nIn May 1947, flight leader Lt. Cmdr. Bob Clarke replaced Butch Voris as the leader of the team. The team with an additional fifth pilot, relocated to [[Naval Air Station Corpus Christi|Naval Air Station (NAS) Corpus Christi]], Texas. On 7 June at [[Birmingham, Alabama]], four F8F-1 Bearcats (numbered 1\u20134) flew in [[diamond formation]] for the first time which is now considered the Blue Angels' trademark. A fifth Bearcat was also added that year. A SNJ was used as a Japanese Zero for dogfights with the Bearcats in air shows.\n\nIn January 1948, Lt. Cmdr. Raleigh \" Dusty\" Rhodes took command of the Blue Angels team which was flying four Bearcats and a yellow painted SNJ with USN markings dubbed \"Beetle Bomb\"; the SNJ represented a Japanese Zero for the air show dogfights with the Bearcats. The name \"Blue Angels\" also was painted on the Bearcats.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://photorecon.net/seventy-years-strong-the-u-s-navys-blue-angels/ |title=Seventy Years Strong: The U.S. Navy's Blue Angels |first=Ken (24 March 2019) |last=Kula |publisher=PHOTORECON, online Magazine |accessdate=24 March 2016}}</ref>\n\nIn 1949, the team acquired a [[Douglas C-47 Skytrain|Douglas R4D Skytrain]] for logistics to and from show sites.

Most of the show alternates between [[Aerobatic maneuver|maneuver]]s performed by the Diamond Formation and those performed by the Solos. The Diamond, in tight formation and usually at lower speeds (400&nbsp;mph), performs maneuvers such as formation loops, rolls, and transitions from one formation to another. The Solos showcase the high performance capabilities of their individual aircraft through the execution of high-speed passes, slow passes, fast rolls, slow rolls, and very tight turns. The highest speed flown during an air show is 700&nbsp;mph (just under Mach 1) and the lowest speed is 120&nbsp;mph.<ref name=\"Blueangels.navy.mil\" /> Some of the maneuvers include both solo aircraft performing at once, such as opposing passes (toward each other in what appears to be a collision course) and mirror formations (back-to-back, belly-to-belly, or wingtip-to-wingtip, with one jet flying inverted).

The demonstration pilots and narrator are made up of Navy and USMC [[Naval Aviator]]s. Pilots serve two to three years,<ref name=\"Blueangels.navy.mil\" /> and position assignments are made according to team needs, pilot experience levels, and career considerations for members. Other officers in the squadron include a [[Naval Flight Officer]] who serves as the Events Coordinator, three USMC C-130 pilots, an Executive Officer, a Maintenance Officer, a Supply Officer, a Public Affairs Officer, an Administrative Officer, and a [[Flight Surgeon]].

Navy and Marine Corps F/A-18 demonstration pilots and naval flight officers are required to have a minimum of 1,250 tactical jet hours and be carrier-qualified. Marine Corps C-130 demonstration pilots are required to have 1,200 flight hours and be an aircraft commander.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://archives.gosportpensacola.com/gosport-03-02-2012.pdf |title=Gosport article, March 02, 2012, \"Blue Angels Seek Officer Applicants\", page 2 |publisher=Gosport NAS Pensacola Base Newspaper}}{{dead link|date=November 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes}}</ref>\n\nApplicants \"rush\" the team at one or more airshows, paid out of their own finances, and sit in on team briefs, post-show activities, and social events.

During winter training, the pilots fly two practice sessions per day, six days a week, to fly the 120 training missions needed to perform the demonstration safely. Separation between the formation of aircraft and their maneuver altitude is gradually reduced over the course of about two months in January and February. The team then returns to their home base in [[Pensacola]], Florida, in March, and continues to practice throughout the show season. A typical week during the season has practices at NAS Pensacola on Tuesday and Wednesday mornings. The team then flies to its show venue for the upcoming weekend on Thursday, conducting \"circle and arrival\" orientation maneuvers upon arrival. The team flies a \"practice\" airshow at the show site on Friday. This show is attended by invited guests but is often open to the general public. The main airshows are conducted on Saturdays and Sundays, with the team returning home to NAS Pensacola on Sunday evenings after the show. Monday is an off day for the Blues' demonstration pilots and road crew. Extensive aircraft maintenance is performed on Sunday evening and Monday by maintenance team members.\n\nPilots maneuver the flight stick with their right hand and operate the throttle with their left. They do not wear [[G-suit]]s because the air bladders inside repeatedly deflate and inflate, interfering with that stability. To prevent blood from pooling in their legs, Blue Angel pilots have developed a method for tensing their muscles to prevent blood from pooling in their lower extremities, possibly rendering them unconscious.<ref name=\"ba_faq\">{{cite web|url=http://www.blueangels.navy.mil/show/faq.aspx|title=Blue Angels Frequently Asked Questions|publisher=United States Navy|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120404171459/http://www.blueangels.navy.mil/show/faq.aspx|archivedate=4 April 2012|url-status=dead|accessdate=3 March 2012}}</ref>\n\n==History==\n===Overview===\n\n[[File:Blue Angels Vinage Insignia.JPG|thumb|upright=0.8|The original team insignia]]\n\nThe Blue Angels were originally formed in April 1946 as the ''Navy Flight Exhibition Team''.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://blueangelsassociation.org/flight-teams/ |title=Flight Teams, 1946 |publisher=Blue Angels Association |accessdate=17 March 2019}}</ref>\n\nThe Flight Exhibition Team was first introduced as the ''Blue Angels'' during an air show in July 1946.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://aerobaticteams.net/en/resources/i39/Blue-Angels-History.html |title=Blue Angels History |publisher=Aerobatic Teams |accessdate=12 March 2019}}</ref>\n\nThe first Blue Angels demonstration aircraft were navy blue (nearly black) with gold lettering.

To boost Navy morale, demonstrate naval air power, and maintain public interest in naval aviation, an underlying mission was to help the Navy generate public and political support for a larger allocation of the shrinking defense budget. Rear Admiral [[Ralph E. Davison|Ralph Davison]] personally selected [[Lieutenant Commander]] [[Roy Marlin Voris|Roy Marlin \"Butch\" Voris]], a World War II [[fighter ace]], to assemble and train a flight demonstration team, naming him Officer-in-Charge and Flight Leader. Voris selected three fellow instructors to join him (Lt. Maurice \"Wick\" Wickendoll, Lt. Mel Cassidy, and Lt. Cmdr. Lloyd Barnard, veterans of the War in the Pacific), and they spent countless hours developing the show. The group perfected its initial maneuvers in secret over the Florida [[Everglades]] so that, in Voris' words, \"if anything happened, just the alligators would know\". The first four pilots and those after them, were and are some of the best and most experienced aviators in the Navy.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.blueangels.org/NANews/Articles/Aug55/Aug55.htm |title=Blue Angels Article, August 1955 |publisher=Naval Aviation News |accessdate=4 March 2019}}</ref>\n[[File:F8F-1 Blue Angels 1946.jpg|thumb|right|[[Grumman F8F Bearcat]]s in \"diamond\" formation, 1947]]\n\nThe team's first demonstration with [[Grumman F6F-5 Hellcat]] aircraft took place before Navy officials on 10 May 1946, and was met with enthusiastic approval. The Blue Angels performed their first public flight demonstration from their first training base and team headquarters at [[Naval Air Station Jacksonville|Naval Air Station (NAS) Jacksonville]], Florida, on 15 and 16 June 1946,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.blueangels.org/NANews/Articles/Aug55/Aug55.htm |title=Blue Angels Article, August 1955 |publisher=Naval Aviation News |accessdate=4 March 2019}}</ref> with three F6F-5 Hellcats (a fourth F6F-5 was held in reserve). On 15 June, Voris led the three Hellcats (numbered 1\u20133), specially modified to reduce weight and painted sea blue with gold leaf trim, through their inaugural 15-minute-long performance.<ref name=\"OFFICIAL\" /> The team employed a [[North American T-6 Texan|North American SNJ Texan]], painted and configured to simulate a [[Japanese Zero]], to simulate aerial combat. This aircraft was later painted yellow and dubbed the \"Beetle Bomb\". This aircraft is said to have been inspired by one of the [[Spike Jones#Murdering the Classics|Spike Jones]]' ''Murdering the Classics'' series of musical satires, set to the tune (in part) of the [[William Tell Overture]] as a thoroughbred horse race scene, with \"Beetle Bomb\" being the \"trailing horse\" in the lyrics.\n\nThe team thrilled spectators with low-flying maneuvers performed in tight formations, and (according to Voris) by \"keeping something in front of the crowds at all times. My objective was to beat the Army Air Corps. If we did that, we'd get all the other side issues. I felt that if we weren't the best, it would be my naval career.\" The Blue Angels' first public demonstration also netted the team its first trophy, which sits on display at the team's current home at [[Naval Air Station Pensacola|NAS Pensacola]]. During an air show at [[Omaha, Nebraska]] on 19\u201321 July 1946, the Navy Flight Exhibition Team was introduced as the ''Blue Angels''.<ref name=\"Blue Angels History\">{{cite web |url=https://aerobaticteams.net/en/resources/i39/Blue-Angels-History.html |title=Blue Angels History |publisher=Aerobatic Teams |accessdate=6 March 2019}}</ref> The name had originated through a suggestion by Right Wing Pilot Lt. Maurice \"Wick\" Wickendoll, after he had read about the Blue Angel nightclub in ''[[The New Yorker]]'' magazine. After ten appearances with the Hellcats, the Hellcats were replaced by the lighter, faster, and more powerful F8F-1 Bearcats on 25 August.<ref name=\"Blue Angels History\"/> By the end of the year the team consisted of four Bearcats numbered 1\u20134 on the tail sections.\n\nIn May 1947, flight leader Lt. Cmdr. Bob Clarke replaced Butch Voris as the leader of the team. The team with an additional fifth pilot, relocated to [[Naval Air Station Corpus Christi|Naval Air Station (NAS) Corpus Christi]], Texas. On 7 June at [[Birmingham, Alabama]], four F8F-1 Bearcats (numbered 1\u20134) flew in [[diamond formation]] for the first time which is now considered the Blue Angels' trademark. A fifth Bearcat was also added that year. A SNJ was used as a Japanese Zero for dogfights with the Bearcats in air shows.\n\nIn January 1948, Lt. Cmdr. Raleigh \" Dusty\" Rhodes took command of the Blue Angels team which was flying four Bearcats and a yellow painted SNJ with USN markings dubbed \"Beetle Bomb\"; the SNJ represented a Japanese Zero for the air show dogfights with the Bearcats.
