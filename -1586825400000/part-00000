{"title_page": "2nd Portuguese India Armada (Cabral, 1500)", "text_new": "{{Refimprove|date=June 2010}}\n[[File:Pedro Alvares Cabral.jpg|thumb|Pedro \u00c1lvares Cabral]]\nThe '''Second [[Portuguese India Armadas|Portuguese India Armada]]''' was assembled in 1500 on the order of King [[Manuel I of Portugal]] and placed under the command of [[Pedro \u00c1lvares Cabral]].  Cabral's armada famously discovered [[Brazil]] for the Portuguese crown along the way. By and large, the Second Armada's diplomatic mission to [[India]] failed, and provoked the opening of hostilities between the [[Kingdom of Portugal]] and the feudal city-state of [[Kozhikode|Calicut]].  Nonetheless, it managed to establish a factory in the nearby [[Kingdom of Cochin]], the first Portuguese [[Factory (trading post)|factory]] in Asia.\n\n== Fleet ==\n\nThe [[1st Portuguese India Armada (Gama, 1497)|first India Armada]], commanded by [[Vasco da Gama]], arrived in Portugal in the summer of 1499, in rather sorry shape. Half of his ships and men had been lost thanks to battles, disease, and storms. Although Gama came back with a hefty cargo of spices that would be sold at enormous profit, he had failed in the principal objective of his mission: to negotiate a treaty with [[Kozhikode|Calicut]], the spice entrep\u00f4t on the [[Malabar Coast]] of India. Gama managed, however, to open the sea route to India via the [[Cape of Good Hope]] and secured good relations with the African city-state of [[Malindi]], a critical staging post along the way.\n\nOn King Manuel I's orders, arrangements were immediately made to begin the assembly of a second armada in [[Cascais]].  Determined not to repeat Gama's mistakes, this one was to be a large and well-armed fleet of 13 ships and 1500 men, laden with valuable gifts and diplomatic letters to win over the potentates of the east.\n\nMany details of the composition of the fleet are missing. Only three ship names are known, and there is some conflict among the sources on the captains.  The following list of ships should not be regarded as authoritative, but as a tentative list compiled from various conflicting accounts.\n\n{| class=\"toccolours\" style=\"border-collapse:collapse\" cellpadding=5\n|style=\"border-bottom:3px solid; background:#efefef;\"|'''Ship Name''' ||style=\"border-bottom:3px solid; background:#efefef;\"|'''Captain'''||style=\"border-bottom:3px solid; background:#efefef;\"|'''Notes'''\n|- valign = top\n| 1. uncertain || D.

Oddly, Couto inserts [[Duarte Pacheco Pereira]] in place of Sim\u00e3o de Pina, but subsequently corrects himself.

Cabral had no notable naval or military experience; his appointment as ''capit\u00e3o-mor'' (captain-major) was largely politically motivated.  The exiled [[Crown of Castile|Castillian]] nobleman [[Sancho de Tovar]] was designated vice-admiral (''soto-capit\u00e3o'') and Cabral's successor should anything happen to him.<ref group=note>This is according to Castanheda and Dami\u00e3o de G\u00f3is. Gaspar Correia identifies Sim\u00e3o de Miranda as the predesignated successor instead.</ref>\n\nVeteran pilot [[Pedro Escobar]] was given the overall technical command of the expedition. Other veterans of the first armada included captain Nicolau Coelho, pilot [[P\u00earo de Alenquer]], and clerks Afonso Lopes and [[Jo\u00e3o de S\u00e1]].  The famed navigator Bartolomeu Dias, who was the first to double the Cape of Good Hope, and his brother Diogo Dias, who had served as clerk on Gama's ship, also served as captains. \n\nMost of the ships were either [[carracks]] (''naus'') or [[caravels]], and at least one was a small supply ship, although details on names and tonnage are missing.<ref group=note>Castanheda (1551) claims there were ten carracks and three caravels. The Anonymous Pilot refers to only twelve ships, plus a supply ship.</ref>  At least two ships, Cabral's flagship and Tovar's ''El Rei'', were said to be around 240 tons, that is, about twice the size of the largest ship in the first armada three years prior.\n\nTen ships were destined for [[Kozhikode|Calicut]] (Malabar, India), while the two ships headed by the Dias brothers were destined for [[Sofala]] in East Africa and the supply ship was destined to be scuttled and burnt along the way.<ref group=note>The Sofala destination of the Dias brothers is found in Castanheda (1551). It is confirmed in the Anonymous Pilot.</ref>\n\n[[File:Cabral armada of 1500 (Livro das Armadas).jpg|thumb|250px|left|Fleet of the 2nd India Armada (Cabral, 1500), from the ''Mem\u00f3ria das Armadas'']]\n\nAt least two ships were privately owned and outfitted: Lu\u00eds Pires's ship was owned by Diogo da Silva e Meneses, [[Count of Portalegre]], while Nuno Leit\u00e3o da Cunha's ''Anunciada'' was owned by the king's cousin D. [[\u00c1lvaro of Braganza]], and financed by an Italian consortium composed of the Florentine bankers [[Bartolomeo Marchionni]] and [[Girolamo Sernigi]] and the Genoese Antonio Salvago. The remainder belonged to the Portuguese crown.\n\nAccompanying the expedition as translator was [[Gaspar da Gama]], who was a Jew captured in Angediva by Vasco Gama, as well as four Hindu hostages from Calicut taken by Gama in 1498 during negotiations. Also aboard was the ambassador of the Sultan of Malindi, who had arrived at Portugal with Gama, and was set to return to Malindi with Cabral's expedition.\n\nOther passengers on the expedition included Aires Correia, the designated [[Factor (agent)|factor]] for Calicut, his secretary P\u00earo Vaz de Caminha, Afonso Furtado, the designated factor for Sofala, and clerk Martinho Neto.  Accompanying them on the trip was the royal physician and amateur astronomer, Master [[Jo\u00e3o Faras]], who brought along the latest astrolabe and new Arabic astronomical staves for navigational experiments.  One chronicler suggests that the knight [[Duarte Pacheco Pereira]] was also aboard.<ref group=note>[[Dami\u00e3o de G\u00f3is]] is the chronicler responsible for this claim.  This is not substantiated elsewhere.  Greenlee (1938, p. li) and Diffie and Winius (1977, p. 188fn) dismiss the possibility.</ref>\n\nThe fleet carried some twenty Portuguese ''[[degredado|degredados]]'', who were criminal convicts who could fulfill their sentences by being abandoned along the shores of various places and exploring inland on the crown's behalf. Four of the degredados are known: Afonso Ribeiro, Jo\u00e3o Machado, Luiz de Moura, and Antonio Fernandes, who was also a ship carpenter. \n\nFinally, the fleet carried eight [[Franciscan]] friars and eight chaplains, under the supervision of the head chaplain, Fr. Henrique Soares of Coimbra. They were the first Portuguese Christian missionaries to India.\n\nThere are three surviving eyewitness accounts of this expedition: (1) an extended letter written by P\u00earo Vaz de Caminha (possibly dictated by Aires Correia), written from Brazil on May 1, 1500, to King Manuel I; (2) the brief letter by Mestre [[Jo\u00e3o Faras]] to the king, also from Brazil; and (3) the account of an anonymous Portuguese pilot, first published in Italian in 1507 (commonly referred to as the ''Rela\u00e7\u00e3o do Piloto An\u00f4nimo'', sometimes believed to be the clerk [[Jo\u00e3o de S\u00e1]]).\n\n== Mission ==\n\nThe priority of the mission was to secure a treaty with [[Zamorin]]'s [[Kozhikode|Calicut]] (''Calecute'', Kozhikode), the principal commercial entrep\u00f4t of the [[Kerala]] spice trade and dominant feudal city-state on the [[Malabar coast]] of [[India]]. [[Vasco da Gama]]'s first armada had visited Calicut in 1498, but had failed to impress the elderly ruling Manivikraman Raja ('Samoothiri Raja'), the [[Zamorin of Calicut]]. As such, no agreements had been signed. Cabral's instructions were to succeed where Gama had failed, and to this end was entrusted with magnificent gifts to present to the Zamorin. Cabral was under orders to establish a ''feitoria'' ([[Factory (trading post)|factory]]) in Calicut, which would be placed under Aires Correia.\n\nThe second priority, assigned to Bartolomeu and Diogo Dias, was to search out the East African port of [[Sofala]], near the mouth of the [[Zambezi]] river.<ref>Anonymous Pilot, p. 107</ref> Sofala had been secretly visited and described by the explorer [[P\u00earo da Covilh\u00e3]] during his overland expedition a decade earlier (c. 1487), and he identified it as the endpoint of the [[Monomatapa]] gold trade.  The Portuguese crown was eager to tap into that gold source, but Gama's armada had failed to find it.  The Dias brothers were instructed to find and establish a factory at Sofala under designated factor Afonso Furtado.  To this end, the brothers were likely also instructed to secure the consent of [[Kilwa Sultanate|Kilwa]] (''Qu\u00edloa''), the dominant city-state of the East African coast and putative overlord of Sofala.  \n\nA minor objective included the delivery of a group of [[Franciscan]] missionaries to India. It is said that Vasco da Gama had misinterpreted the [[Hinduism]] he saw practiced in India as a form of \"primitive\" Christianity.  He believed its peculiar characteristics were a result of centuries of separation from the mainstream church in Europe. As such, Gama recommended that missionaries be sent to India to help bring the practices of the \"Hindu church\" up to date with Roman Catholic orthodoxy.  To this end, a group of Franciscan friars, led by Fr. Henrique Soares of Coimbra, joined the expedition.\n\nAs a final objective, the Second Armada was also a commercial spice run. The crown and private merchants who had outfitted the ships expected full cargoes of spices to return to Lisbon. \n\n=== Suspected Brazilian mission ===\n\nThere has been some debate over whether Cabral also had secret instructions from the king to lay claim to the landmass of Brazil\u2014or, more precisely, to swing as far west as possible to the [[Treaty of Tordesillas|Tordesillas line]] and claim whatever lands or islands might be discovered there for the Portuguese crown, before the Spanish did.<ref>{{cite book|last=Peres |first=Dami\u00e3o |date=1949 |title=O descobrimento do Brasil por Pedro \u00c1lvares Cabral: antecedentes e intencionalidade |language=Portuguese}}</ref> Among the pieces of evidence is an indication of an island in the area in a 1448 map of [[Andrea Bianco]], apparently alluded to in the letter of Master Jo\u00e3o Faras; there is also the suggestion by [[Duarte Pacheco Pereira]] in his ''Esmeraldo de Situ Orbis'' that he had been sent on an expedition to a western landmass in 1498.<ref>{{cite book|last=Pacheco Pereira |first=Duarte |date=c. 1505 |title=Esmeraldo de Situ Orbis |url=https://archive.org/details/esmeraldodesitu00peregoog/page/n62/mode/2up |chapter=Cap 2: Da cantidade & grandeza da terra, & daugua qual destas he a mayor parte. |language=Portuguese}}</ref> That is about the full extent of the evidence of intentionality and this claim is largely speculative.<ref>{{cite book|last=Greenlee |first=William Brooks |date=1938 |pages=l\u2013lv |title=The Voyage of Pedro \u00c1lvares Cabral to Brazil and India: from contemporary documents and narratives |publisher=Routledge |isbn=1409414485}}</ref> There are various reasons to presume the existence of such instructions unlikely.\n\nSpanish explorers had certainly been tending south at that time. Christopher Columbus]had touched the coast of the South American mainland around [[Guyana]] in 1498 on his [[Voyages of Christopher Columbus#Third voyage|third trip]]. In late 1499, [[Alonso de Ojeda]] had discovered much of the [[Venezuela|Venezuelan]] coast and in early 1500, [[Vicente Y\u00e1\u00f1ez Pinz\u00f3n]] and [[Diego de Lepe]], via generous southerly swings from the [[Canary islands]], had reached at least what is now [[Cear\u00e1]], and perhaps went as far east as [[Cabo de Santo Agostinho|Cape of Santo Agostinho]] in [[Pernambuco]]. They had explored much of the northern Brazilian coast west of it. It is possible that the southerly Spanish tendencies were deliberate, aimed at securing more land for the Spanish crown.<ref group=note>Although the person from whom the Spanish crown was trying to claim land was not the king of Portugal, as that was already mediated by Tordesillas, but Christopher Columbus, their own vice-roy of the Indies. Ojeda, Pinz\u00f3n, and Lepe were all dispatched on separate royal capitulations by [[Juan Rodr\u00edguez de Fonseca|Bishop Fonseca]], an enemy of Columbus, with the deliberate intent of finding and claiming lands ''outside'' (i.e., to the south) of the Columbus-owned West Indian islands, thereby circumscribing Columbus's viceroyalty and limiting him to the islands he already had. This would figure in later lawsuits by the Columbus family.</ref>\n\nThese expeditions, however, were too recent for their results to have been known in Lisbon before Cabral's departure in March 1500; indeed, they were unknown in Spain itself. It is very doubtful that the Portuguese were aware of them. Even if they were, it would not seem sensible for Cabral's Second Armada to be instructed to deviate from its original mission in India to pursue exploratory work which be far more efficiently accomplished by smaller caravels. \n\n== Outward journey ==\n\n[[File:Cabral armada of 1500 (Livro de Lisuarte de Abreu).jpg|thumb|350px|Fleet of the 2nd India Armada (Cabral, 1500), from the ''Livro de Lisuarte de Abreu'']]\nOn March 9, Cabral's expedition set out from the [[Tagus]]. Thirteen days later, on March 22, Cabral's armada reached the island of [[S\u00e3o Nicolau, Cape Verde|S\u00e3o Nicolau]] in the middle of a storm.  The privately outfitted ship of Lu\u00eds Pires was too damaged by the tempest to continue, and returned to Lisbon<ref>According to Barros (1552, II.5.2 [https://books.google.com/books?id=Epo2AAAAMAAJ&dq=editions%3AUOM39015057112644&lr&as_brr=1&pg=PA386#v=onepage&q&f=false p.386]); also Castanheda (1551), G\u00f3is (1566).</ref><ref group=note>Caminha's eyewitness account made no mention of Pires and instead reported that it was the Vasco de Ataide's crown ship that was lost around Cape Verde.</ref>\n\nFrom Cape Verde, Cabral went southwest. It is unknown why he chose such an unusual direction, but the most probable hypothesis is that he was simply following the wide arc in the South Atlantic to catch a favorable wind to carry them to the Cape of Good Hope. Navigationally, the arc is sensible. From Cape Verde, the ship would cut across the [[doldrums]] below the equator, catch the southwest-bound [[South Equatorial Current|equatorial drift]], and turn into the southbound [[Brazil Current]] that will carry them down to the [[horse latitudes]] (30\u00b0S), where the prevailing [[westerlies]] begin.  The westerlies would easily carry the ships across the South Atlantic around the Cape of Good Hope. If instead of this arc, Cabral attempted to strike southeast from Cape Verde, it would go into the [[Gulf of Guinea]]. To reach the Cape from there would be a struggle, as Cabral would have had to sail against the southeasterly [[trade wind|trade winds]], as well as the [[Benguela Current]]. \n\nHow Cabral knew of this arc is unknown. Most likely, this was precisely the route followed by Gama on his first trip in 1497. The veterans of the first fleet\u2014notably the pilots Alenquer and Escobar\u2014would very likely have charted the same route for Cabral again.<ref group=note>That this arc was sailed by Gama in 1497 is uncertain, but most modern historians have come to accept that he did. How did Gama know about the arc when no one had yet sailed it before? Some have speculated that the Portuguese crown might have dispatched secret exploratory expeditions to those waters in advance. The more widely accepted hypothesis, first forwarded by admiral [[Gago Coutinho]], is more straightforward: Since Bartolomeu Dias's 1488 expedition discovered the westerlies, the South Atlantic arc became \"navigationally obvious\" to any sensible pilot, especially pilots as experienced as Alenquer and Escobar. See Gago Coutinho (1951\u201352) ''A Nautica dos Descobrimentos: os descobrimentos maritimos visitos por um navegador'', 2 vols., Lisbon: Agencia Geral do Ultramar.</ref> Indeed, in the Lisbon archives, there is a draft of a document intended for Cabral that instructs him to strike in a southwesterly direction when he reaches the doldrums.<ref>After Cape Verde, where the wind is weak ('vento escasso') the ships should strike in the open ocean arc ('ir na volta do mar'), until the Cape of Good Hope, as this is the shorter route ('a navega\u00e7\u00e3o ser\u00e1 mais breve'). See Fonseca (1908, p. 211; see also p.224) [https://books.google.com/books?id=A7lI4gqh7PsC&pg=PA208#v=onepage&q&f=false copy of letter]; see also Greenlee (1938, p. 167)</ref> \n\nAlternative hypotheses forwarded for Cabral striking southwest are that he was trying to reach the [[Azores]] to repair his storm-battered fleet, that he was searching for and rounding up missing tempest-tossed ships, or that it was an intentional attempt to discover if there was any land by the Tordesillas line.\n\n=== Discovery of Brazil ===\n\nCabral took the same path as Gama had, but made a slightly wider arc and went further west than Gama had. As a result, he hit upon the hitherto unknown landmass of Brazil. After nearly 30 days of sailing (44 since departure), on April 21, Cabral's fleet found the first indications of nearby land.<ref>{{cite book|last=Fonseca |first=Faustino da |date=1908 |page=225 |title=A Descoberta to Brasil |language=Portuguese |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=A7lI4gqh7PsC&pg=PA208#v=onepage&q&f=false |publisher=Livraria Central de Gomes de Carvalho |place=Lisbon}}</ref> The next day, the armada caught sight of the Brazilian coast, seeing the outlines of a hill they named [[Monte Pascoal]].\n\nThe armada anchored at the mouth of the [[Do Frade River|Frade river]] the next day, and a group of local [[Tupiniquim]] Indians assembled on the beach. Cabral dispatched a small party, headed by Nicolau Coelho, in a longboat ashore to make first contact. Coelho tossed his hat in exchange for a feathered headdress, but the surf was too strong for a proper landing and opening of communication, so they returned to the ships.<ref>{{cite book|last=Fonseca |first=Faustino da |date=1908 |pages=241\u2013242 |title=A Descoberta to Brasil |language=Portuguese |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=A7lI4gqh7PsC&pg=PA208#v=onepage&q&f=false |publisher=Livraria Central de Gomes de Carvalho |place=Lisbon}}</ref>\n\nStrong overnight winds prompted the armada to lift anchor and sail some 10 leagues (45&nbsp;km) north, finding harbor behind the reef at Cabr\u00e1lia Bay, just north of [[Porto Seguro]].  The pilot Afonso Lopes, while [[Sounding line|sounding]] in a rowboat, spotted a native canoe, captured the two Indians on board, and brought them back to ship. The language barrier prevented questioning, but they were fed and given cloth and beads. The cultural difference was apparent: The natives spat out their honey and cake and were deeply surprised upon seeing a chicken.<ref>Guia politicamente incorreto da Hist\u00f3ria do Brasil, Leandro Narloch</ref>\n\nThe next day, on April 25, a party led by Coelho and Bartolomeu Dias went ashore, accompanied by the two natives. Armed Tupiniquim warily approached the beach, but upon a signal from the two natives, set down their bows, and allowed the Portuguese to land and collect water.\n\n[[File:Meirelles-primeiramissa2.jpg|thumb|right|250px|''The First Mass in Brazil'' by [[Victor Meirelles]] (1861)]]\n\nOn April 26, the Octave of Easter Sunday, the Franciscan friar Henrique Soares of Coimbra went ashore to celebrate mass in front of 200 Tupiniquim Indians.  This is the first known Christian mass on the American mainland.\n\nInteraction between the Portuguese and the Tupiniquim gradually increased throughout the week.  European iron nails, cloth, beads, and crucifixes were traded for American amulets, spears, parrots, and monkeys. There was only the slightest hint that precious metals might be found in the hinterlands. Portuguese ''degredados'' are assigned to spend the night in Tupiniquim villages, while the rest of the crew sleeps aboard ships.\n\n[[File:Carta-caminha.png|thumb|150px|Facsimile of P\u00earo Vaz de Caminha's letter to the king, reporting the discovery of the \"Island of the True Cross\" (Brazil)]]\n\nOn May 1, Cabral makes preparations to resume the journey to India. The Portuguese pilots, assisted by the physician-astronomer Master Jo\u00e3o Faras, determined that Brazil lay east of the Tordesillas line, prompting Cabral to formally claim it for the Portuguese crown, bestowing upon it the name of ''Ilha de Vera Cruz'' (\"Island  of the True Cross\"). It was later renamed ''Terra de Santa Cruz''\u2014\"Land of the Holy Cross\"\u2014upon the realization that it was not an island).<ref group=note>Gaspar Correia ([https://books.google.com/books?id=YmVKAAAAYAAJ&dq=editions%3ALCCN05022145&as_brr=1&pg=PA152#v=onepage&q&f=false p.152]) and Jo\u00e3o de Barros ([https://books.google.com/books?id=Epo2AAAAMAAJ&dq=editions%3AUOM39015057112644&lr&as_brr=1&pg=PA391#v=onepage&q&f=false p.391]) say it was named \"Santa Cruz\" from the start, with Correia saying it was named so because the departure date was the [[Feast of the Cross]] on the liturgical calendar.

The fleet faced headlong winds for six straight days and four ship\u2014Bartolomeu Dias's, Aires Gomes da Silva's, Sim\u00e3o de Pina's, and Vasco de Ata\u00edde's\u2014are lost at sea in the process.<ref>Castanheda (1551)</ref><ref>Barros (1552)</ref><ref>G\u00f3is (1566)</ref><ref group=note>The ''Rela\u00e7ao das Naos'' mistakenly substitutes Sim\u00e3o de Miranda for Sim\u00e3o da Pina in the losses, although this is corrected in the marginal gloss. Gaspar Correia (1550) almost concurs\u2014but as he does not have Aires Gomes da Silva on his original captain list, he identifies the fourth ship lost as Gaspar de Lemos. Similarly, the ''Livro de Lisuarte d'Abreu'' (1563), which has neither Pina nor Gomes da Silva on its list, say it was Diogo de Figueir\u00f3 and Luis Pires who were lost.  Diogo do Couto (c.1600) mistakenly adds P\u00earo d'Ataide to the list, bringing the losses to five. Some scholars also contend that Pires was lost at this point, and Vasco de Ata\u00edde had been lost earlier at Cape Verde.</ref> In this way, the fleet was reduced to seven ships. Facing strong winds, the armada split into smaller groups to meet again on the other side. Cabral's ship went with two others.\n\nOn June 16, 1500, Cabral's three-ship squadron reached the [[Primeiras and Segundas Archipelago|Primeiras Islands]] several leagues north of Sofala.  Two local merchant ships, catching sight of Cabral, took flight. Cabral gave pursuit\u2014one of them runs aground and the other is captured. Upon questioning, it was discovered that these ships were owned by a cousin of the sultan Fateima of Malindi (who had received Vasco da Gama in 1498), so they were released. \n\nThe three ships landed on [[Mozambique Island]] on June 22. Despite the earlier quarrel with his ships, Cabral was given a warm reception by the Sultan of Mozambique and was allowed to collect water and supplies.  Shortly after, three more ships of the Second Armada sailed into the island and joined with Cabral.  Only the ship of Diogo Dias remained missing.  As Dias's mission was for Sofala anyway, Cabral decided not to wait for it and instead pressed on with his fleet of six ships.\n\n[[File:Map of Cabral route, 1500.gif|thumb|340px|Approximate route of outward journey of Cabral's 2nd Armada (also route of stray ship of Diogo Dias)]]\n\nMore than a month later, on July 26, Cabral's armada reached [[Kilwa Kisiwani|Kilwa]], the dominant city-state of the East African coast and which Gama had never visited. Afonso Furtado, who had been appointed factor for Sofala in Lisbon and had escaped death (Furtado had been aboard Bartolomeu Dias's ship, but moved to the flagship just before the Cape crossing), went ashore to open negotiations with the strongman ruler, Emir Ibrahim.<ref group=note>At the time, there was no ruling [[Kilwa Sultanate|Sultan of Kilwa]] as the previous one, al-Fudail, had been deposed in a coup (c. 1495) by his minister, Emir Ibrahim, who had since ruled Kilwa with a vacant throne.</ref>\n\nA meeting was arranged between Cabral and Ibrahim, conducted on a couple of rowboats in the harbor. Cabral presents a letter from King Manuel I proposing a treaty, but Ibrahim was suspicious and remained resistant to the overtures. Cabral, sensing Ibrahim's resistance and worrying that they might miss the monsoon winds to India, broke off the negotiations and sailed on.\n\nPressing north, the Cabral fleet avoided the hostile [[Mombassa]] (''Momba\u00e7a'') and finally reached friendly Malindi (''Melinde'') on August 2.  There, he was well-received by the Sultan of Malindi and dropped off the Malindi ambassador that Gama had taken the previous year.  Leaving behind  two ''degredados'', Lu\u00eds de Moura and Jo\u00e3o Machado, and picking up two Gujarati pilots, Cabral's six-ship armada finally began its Indian Ocean crossing on August 7, 1500.\n\n== Cabral in India ==\n{{Refimprove-section|date=April 2020}}\nAfter an uneventful ocean crossing, Cabral's six ships landed on [[Anjediva Island]] (''Angediva'', Anjadip) on August 22, where they rested and repaired and repainted the ships.\n\nSailing down the Indian coast, Cabral's expedition finally reached [[Kozhikode|Calicut]] on September 13. Gaily decorated native boats came out to greet them, but remembering Gama's experience, Cabral refused to go ashore until hostages were exchanged. He dispatched Afonso Furtado and the four Calicut hostages taken by Gama the previous year to negotiate the details of the landing. When the negotiation was complete, Cabral finally went ashore himself and met the new Zamorin of Calicut. Cabral presents him with much finer and more luxurious gifts than Gama had brought, and more respectful and personalized letters of address from King Manuel I of Portugal.\n\nA commercial treaty was successfully negotiated and the Zamorin gave Cabral a security-of-trade certificate etched on a silver plate. The Portuguese were permitted to establish a ''feitoria]]'' in Calicut. Aires Correia went ashore with around 70 men. Once the factory was set up, Cabral released the ship hostages as a sign of trust and Correia set about buying spices in Calicut's markets for the ships to take home.\n\nSometime in October, the Zamorin of Calicut dispatched a service request to Cabral's idling fleet. Arab merchants allied with the rival city-state of [[Cochin kingdom|Cochin]] were returning from [[Ceylon]] with a cargo of war elephants destined for the Sultan of [[Cambay]]. Claiming it to be illegal contraband, the Zamorin asked Cabral to intercept them. Cabral sent one of his caravels under P\u00earo de Ata\u00edde to capture it.  Hoping for a spectacle, the Zamorin himself came down to the beachfront to witness the engagement, but left in disgust when the Arab ship slipped past Ataide, who gave chase and eventually caught up to it near Cannanore] He successfully seized the vessel and Cabral presented the captured ship, with its nearly intact elephant cargo, to the Zamorin as a gift.\n\n=== Calicut Massacre ===\n\nBy December of 1500, factor Aires Correia was still only able to buy enough spices to load two of the ships. He complained to Cabral his suspicions that the guild of Arab merchants in Calicut had been colluding to shut out Portuguese purchasing agents from the city's spice markets. Arab traders had reportedly used similar tactics to drive out Chinese merchants earlier in the 15th century from various ports on the [[Malabar Coast]]. Correia thought that it would make sense if they repeated this, particularly as the Portuguese had been clear with their hatred of \"the Moors\" and had demanded trading privileges and preferences.<ref group=note>Historians now think that the Portuguese traders may have in fact been unwitting counters in ongoing quarrels between competing older and newer Arab merchant guilds in Calicut. They may also have been used as pawns in the personal power struggles among the Zamorin's leading advisors.</ref>\n\nCabral presented Correia's complaint to the Zamorin, and requested that he crack down on the Arab merchant guild or enforce Portuguese priority in the spice markets. But the Zamorin refused Cabral's demand that he actively intervene in the market. \n\nFrustrated by the Zamorin's inaction, Cabral decided to take matters into his own hands. On December 17, on the advice of Aires Correia, Cabral ordered the seizure of an Arab merchant ship from [[Jeddah]], which had been loaded up with spices. He claimed that the Zamorin had promised the Portuguese priority in the spice markets, and so the cargo was rightfully theirs. Incensed, the Arab merchants around the quay immediately raised a riot in Calicut and direct mobs to attack the Portuguese factory. The Portuguese ships, anchored out in the harbor and unable to approach the docks, could only watch the unfolding massacre. After three hours of fighting, 53 (though some sources say 70) Portuguese were slaughtered by the mobs\u2014including the factor Aires Correia, the secretary Caminha, and three (some say five) of the Franciscan friars.  Around twenty Portuguese in the city managed to escape the riot by jumping into the harbor waters and swimming to the ships. The survivors reported to Cabral that the Zamorin's own guards were seen either standing aside or actively helping the rioters. At least one Portuguese, a man called Gon\u00e7alo Peixoto, was sheltered from the mob by a local merchant (whom the chronicles call \"Coja Bequij\") and survived the massacre. \n\nAfter the Calicut massacre, the wares in the Portuguese factory were impounded by the Calicut authorities.\n\n=== War with Calicut ===\n\nIncensed at the attack on the factory, Cabral waited one day for redress by the Zamorin.  When this did not arrive, Cabral and the Portuguese seized around ten Arab merchant ships then in harbor between December 18 and 22. They confiscated the ships' cargoes, killed the crews, and burned their ships. Then, accusing the Zamorin of sanctioning the riot, Cabral ordered a full day [[shore bombardment]] of Calicut, doing immense damage to the unfortified city. Estimates of Calicut casualties reach up to 600. Cabral proceeded to also bomb the nearby Zamorin-owned port of Pandarane.<ref group=note>The port of Pandarane has since disappeared. Its location is usually identified as 'Pantalyini Kollam', a port that has since been annexed by the growing city of [[Koyilandy]]; it is also sometimes identified with modern [[Kappad]]. (Dames, 1918, p.85)</ref>\n\nThis marked the beginning of the war between the Kingdom of Portugal and the Zamorin of Calicut. The war dragged on for the next decade and became an important focus of future armadas. It ultimately dictated Portuguese strategy in the Indian Ocean and overturned the political order on the Malabar Coast of India.\n\n=== Alliance with Cochin kingdom ===\n\n[[File:Kerala cities at time of Cabral (1500).gif|thumb|250px|India Malabar Coast c. 1500]]\nOn December 24, Cabral left the smoldering Calicut, unsure of what to do next. At the suggestion of Gaspar da Gama, the Goese Jew who had been accompanying the expedition, Cabral set sail south along the coast toward Cochin kingdom (''Cochim'', Kochi or Perumpadappu Swarupam), a small Hindu [[Nair]] city-state at the outlet of the [[Vembanad Lake|Vembanad lagoon]] in the Kerala backwaters. Partly in vassalage to and partly at war with Zamorin's Calicut, Cochin had long chafed at the dominance of its larger neighbor and was looking for an opportunity to break away.\n\nArriving in Cochin, a Portuguese emissary and a [[Saint Thomas Christians|Christian]] picked up in Calicut went ashore to make contact with the Trimumpara Raja (Unni Goda Varma), the Nair Hindu prince of Cochin.<ref group=note>The exact status of the Trimumpara Raja is a bit unclear.  It seems that the formal ruler of Cochin was the king of [[Edapalli]], which was across the lagoon on the mainland, but that the Cochinese peninsula (with capital at [[Perumpadappu (Malappuram district)|Perumpadappu]]) had at some point been detached as an appanage for a son, who, in turn, had detached the northern tip, Cochin proper, for another son. Moreover, it seems that these appanages were not supposed to be permanent fiefs, but rather to serve as temporary \"training grounds\" for princely heirs before they moved up in succession order. In other words, the ruler of Cochin was the second heir of Edapalli. Upon the death of the ruler of Edapalli, the first heir was meant to leave the peninsula and take up his duties in Edapalli, and the second heir would from Cochin to Perumpadappu, and assign Cochin to his own successor (the new second heir). The Portuguese seem to have arrived at a time when the princely heirs were somewhat at odds with one another, for some reason or another. It was only under Portuguese protection that the rulers of Cochin finally became proper kings in their own right.  Thus the Raja Trimumpara's search for a Portuguese alliance possibly had more to do with his own family quarrels than with the exactions of the Zamorin of Calicut.  See Dames (1918: p.86n).</ref> The Portuguese were greeted warmly, with the bombardment of Calicut outweighing the earlier matter of the war elephants. With all the cordialities and hostage-swapping completed quickly, Cabral himself went ashore and negotiated a treaty of alliance between Portugal and Cochin, directed against Zamorin's Calicut. Cabral promised to make the Trimumpara Raja of Cochin the ruler of kingdom of Calicut upon the city's capture.\n\nA Portuguese factory is set up in Cochin, with Gon\u00e7alo Gil Barbosa as chief factor. The spice markets of the smaller Cochin were not nearly as well-supplied as those of Calicut, but the trade was good enough to begin loading ships.  The stay in Cochin was not, however, without incident. The factory was set ablaze one evening, likely at the instigation of Arab traders in the city. The Trimumpara Raja, in contrast with the Zamorin of Calicut, cracked down on the arsonists. He took the Portuguese under his protection by having the factors stay in his palace and assigned his personal Nair guards to escort the factors in the city markets and protect the factory against further incidents.\n\nIn early January of 1501, while in Cochin, Cabral received missives from the rulers of Cannanore (''Canonor'', Kannur or Kolathunad), one of Calicut's reluctant rivals in the north, and [[Quilon]] (''Coul\u00e3o'', Kollam or Venad Swarupam), which was further south and had once been a great Syrian Christian merchant city-state, being an entrep\u00f4t for cinnamon, ginger, and dyewood.  They commended Cabral's actions against Calicut and invited the Portuguese to trade in their cities instead. Not wishing to offend his Cochinese host, Cabral declined the invitations, only promising to visit the cities at some future date.\n\nWhile still in Cochin, Cabral received yet another invitation, this one from the nearby [[Kodungallur Kovilakam|Cranganore kingdom]] (''Cranganor'', Kodungallur). The once-great capital of the [[Chera dynasty]] of [[Sangam period]] had recently been facing various natural disasters. The channels that connected Cranganore to the waterways were silted up, breaking open a competing sea outlet by Cochin in the 14th century.<ref group=note>Cochin was originally just a village along a long embankment.  Violent overflows of the [[Periyar River]] in 1341 forced the opening of the outlet between the Vembanad lagoon and the Arabian Sea at the juncture where Cochin now sits, separating the long Cochinese peninsula from what is now [[Vypin]] island. See Hunter's ''Imperial Gazetteer'' (1908, p.360).</ref> Cochin's rise had been principally due to the re-routing of commercial traffic away from Cranganore. Nonetheless, the remaining merchants of the dwindling city still maintained their old connections to the Kerala pepper plantations in the interior. Finding the supply in Cochin running low, Cabral took up the offer to load some cargo at Cranganore.\n\nThe visit to Cranganore turned out to be an eye-opener for the Portuguese, for among the city's remaining inhabitants are substantial established communities of [[Cochin Jews|Malabari Jews]] and [[Syrian Malabar Nasrani|Syrian Christians]].  The encounter with a clearly recognizable Christian community in Kerala confirmed to Cabral what the Franciscan friars had already suspected back in Calicut, namely that Vasco da Gama's earlier hypothesis about a \"Hindu Church\" was mistaken. If real Christians had existed alongside Hindus in India for centuries, after all, then clearly Hinduism must be a distinct religion. Hindus were \"heathen idolaters\", as the Portuguese friars characterized them, rather than adherents to a \"primitive\" form of Christianity.  Two Syrian Christian priests from Cranganore applied to Cabral for passage to Europe.<ref group=note>One of these priests, known as Jos\u00e9 de Cranganore or Joseph the Indian (''Josephus Indus''), eventually would provide instrumental intelligence about India to the Portuguese. Upon arrival in Lisbon, Joseph the Indian spent a couple of years being intensely interviewed by the Portuguese court and the [[Casa da \u00cdndia]], relating to them his detailed knowledge of the history and geography of India and the east, expanding Portuguese intelligence dramatically. It is likely that the detailed depiction of the east Indian coast and the [[Bay of Bengal]] in the [[Cantino planisphere]] of 1502 is owed in large part to this information.  Around 1503, Joseph went to Rome to meet [[Pope Alexander VI]] and report on the condition of the Malabari Syrian Christian church.  It was on this trip that Joseph dictated his famous narrative on India to an Italian scribe, which was eventually published in 1507 (in Italian) as part of a collection, ''Paesi Novamente Retrovati'', edited by Fracanzio da Montalboddo.  The narrative includes Joseph's own account of Cabral's expedition.  See Vallavanthara (2001).</ref>\n\nOn January 16, 1501, news arrived that the Zamorin of Calicut had assembled and dispatched a fleet of around 80 boats against the Portuguese in Cochin.  Despite the Trimumpara Raja of Cochin's offer of military assistance against the Calicut fleet, Cabral decided to precipitously lift anchor and slip away rather than risk a confrontation. Cabral's armada left behind the factor Gon\u00e7alo Gil Barbosa and six assistants in Cochin. In their hasty departure, the Portuguese inadvertently took along two of the Trimumpara's officers (Idikkela Menon and Parangoda Mennon), who had been serving as hostages aboard the vessels.\n\nHeading north, Cabral's armada took a wide sweep to avoid Calicut, and paid a quick visit to Cannanore. Cabral was warmly received by the [[Kolathiri]] Raja of Cannanore who, eager for a Portuguese alliance, offered to sell the Portuguese spices on credit. Cabral accepted the cargo but paid him nonetheless. Even though the cargo turned out to only be low-quality ginger, Cabral was appreciative of the gesture. \n\nHis ships now filled with spices, Cabral decided not to visit Quilon, as he had earlier promised, but to make way back home to Portugal instead.\n\n== Diogo Dias's misadventures ==\n{{Unreferenced-section|date=April 2020}}\nWhile Cabral's main fleet was in India, Diogo Dias, captain of the missing seventh ship of the armada, was going through his own set of adventures. \n\n[[File:Detail of Diogo Dias's ship (Cabral Armada).jpg|thumb|180px|Ship of [[Diogo Dias]], detail from the ''Mem\u00f3ria das Armadas'']]\n\nShortly after being separated from the main fleet at the Cape in June 1500, Dias had struck out too far east into the Indian Ocean and sighted the western coast of the island of [[Madagascar]].  Although the island was not unknown (its Arab name, \"island of the Moon\", was already reported by [[Pero de Covilha]]), Dias was the first Portuguese captain to have sighted it and is often credited with renaming it the island of ''S\u00e3o Louren\u00e7o'', on account of it being found on [[St. Lawrence]]'s day (August 10, 1500).  However, a proper landing on Madagascar would not be undertaken until 1506 and it would only be extensively explored in 1508. \n\nLikely thinking that he was on a South African island, Dias tried to find the African coast by sailing straight north from Madagascar, hoping to reconnect with Cabral's armada there, or to make it to Sofala, Dias's official destination. But he had struck too far east and was in fact in open ocean.  Dias sighted the African coast only around [[Mogadishu]] (''Magadoxo''), by which point Cabral had already crossed the Indian Ocean. The change in the monsoon winds prevented Dias from undertaking his own crossing. Dias pushed up the coast, unexpectedly passing [[Cape Guardafui]] into the [[Gulf of Aden]], waters previously unexplored by Portuguese ships.  Dias spent the next few months in the area. He was trapped by contrary winds, battered by tempests, attacked by Arab pirates, and forced aground on the Eritrean coast, unable to find food and water.\n\nEventually, in late 1500 and early 1501, Dias managed to procure supplies, repair his ship, and catch a favorable wind to take him out of the gulf. With his remaining six crewmen, Dias set sail back to Portugal, hoping to catch Cabral's armada on the return journey.\n\n== Return journey ==\n{{Unreferenced-section|date=April 2020}}\nIn late January of 1501, Cabral took aboard an ambassador from Cannanore and started his ocean crossing back to East Africa.  On the way, the Portuguese captured a Gujarati ship, replete with a magnificent cargo.  They stole the cargo, but, upon realizing that the crewmen were not Arabs, spared them.\n\nAs Cabral's expedition approached Malindi in February, vice-admiral Sancho de Tovar, sailing at the front, ran his spice-laden ship, the ''El Rei'', aground on the Malindi coast. The great ship was irreparable. To recover the iron fittings, it was burnt, and the crew and the cargo were reallocated.  Cabral authorized the king of Malindi to recover the cannons from the wreck and keep them for himself.\n\nCabral's fleet, reduced to just five ships, reached Mozambique Island in the spring. As there was no news from Diogo Dias, Cabral decided to take responsibility for the Sofala mission himself. Cabral ordered the private ship ''Anunciada'' of Nuno Leit\u00e3o da Cunha, the fastest in the fleet, to be placed under the command of veteran hand Nicolau Coelho. He dispatched it ahead of the rest of the fleet to deliver the results of the voyage to Portugal. Tovar took command of the caravel ''S\u00e3o Pedro'', previously commanded by P\u00earo de Ata\u00edde, with the intent to seek out Sofala and proceed home alone from there. Ata\u00edde was transferred to the command of Coelho's old nau. \n\nIn the meantime, Cabral landed the ''degredado'' Ant\u00f3nio Fernandes on the African coast, with letters of instruction for Diogo Dias and any passing Portuguese expeditions, informing them of the dramatic turn of events in India, and warning them to avoid Calicut. It is uncertain exactly where Cabral left Ant\u00f3nio Fernandes or where he was ordered to go. According to Ata\u00edde, Fernandes was ordered to go to Mombassa, which was odd, as Mombassa was at the time on hostile terms with the Portuguese; others suggest he was supposed to go to Kilwa (which is where the [[3rd Portuguese India Armada (Nova, 1501)|Third Armada]] of [[Jo\u00e3o da Nova]] eventually found him). Others have speculated that Fernandes was left in Kilwa on the outward leg, and that Cabral's letters were dispatched to him by a local messenger from Mozambique on the return. It is also possible that Fernandes had been instructed to make his way to Sofala overland, meet Tovar's ship there, and then proceed to explore inland from there to locate [[Monomatapa]], though this does not explain why Cabral had given him the letters. Finally, some conjecture that Fernandes here is in fact another ''degredado'', Jo\u00e3o Machado, who had been left in Malindi on the first leg. Machado, it is thought, may have been picked up on the return and was sent back once again with the letters. \n\nMatters settled, Cabral took the remaining three ships\u2014his own flagship, the large nau of Sim\u00e3o de Miranda, and Coelho's ship (now under P\u00earo de Ata\u00edde)\u2014and set sail out of Mozambique Island.\n\nAta\u00edde became separated from the other two in the [[Mozambique Channel]] soon after departure. He hurried to [[Mossel Bay|S\u00e3o Br\u00e1s]], hoping to find Cabral there waiting for him. But Cabral and Miranda had decided to proceed on together towards Lisbon without him, so Ata\u00edde made his way home alone, leaving behind a letter in a boot by a local watering hole giving an account of the expedition; Ataide's note would be found later that year by Jo\u00e3o da Nova's third armada.\n\nIn the meantime, Sancho de Tovar, aboard the ''S\u00e3o Pedro'', finally caught sight of Sofala, the entrep\u00f4t of Monomatapa gold. He stayed in his ship, scouting the city from there, before setting sail back home alone.\n\n=== Conference at Bezeguiche ===\n\nOn June 2, 1501, following up on the discovery of Brazil the previous year, King Manuel I of Portugal assembled a small exploratory expedition of three caravels under an unnamed Portuguese captain  to explore and map the coast of Brazil. Aboard the ship was the Florentine cosmographer Amerigo Vespucci.  The exact identity of the captain is uncertain. Some speculate it to have been the commander of the supply vessel that had delivered the news a year earlier (either Lemos or Gon\u00e7alves); others conjecture the commander went as a passenger and that the expedition itself was commanded by [[Gon\u00e7alo Coelho]].<ref group=note>Amerigo Vespucci wrote two detailed accounts of this expedition\u2014in ''Mundus Novus'' (pub. 1502/03) and as the \"third voyage\" in ''Lettera a Soderini'' (pub.1504/05)\u2014but does not identify the Portuguese captain by name in either. Chronicler Gaspar Correia, writing a half-century later, identifies the mapping captain as the same captain who steered the returning supply ship.  Greenlee (1945) suggests the captain was [[Fern\u00e3o de Loronha]], although this has been dismissed by others (e.g., Roukema, 1963). More recently, historians have drawn attention to a nautical chart by [[Vesconte de Maggiolo]], which identifies the Brazilian landmass with the label ''Tera de Gonsalvo Coigo Vocatur Santa Cruz'' (translated as \"Land of Gon\u00e7alo Coelho called Santa Cruz\"). \u00a0Gon\u00e7alo Coelho is known to have led a later expedition to Brazil, which set out in 1503, but it is commonly estimated that Coelho was still out at sea when Maggiolo composed his chart (c. 1504-05), thereby suggesting that Coelho might have also captained the previous 1501 mapping expedition as well. (Morison, 1974, vol. 2, p.281)</ref> Setting out from Lisbon in May 1501, the expedition made a watering stop in early June at Bezeguiche, as the bay of [[Dakar]], near present-day Senegal, was known to the Portuguese sailors of the time. There, they stumbled upon Diogo Dias, who related to the Portuguese captain and Vespucci the tales of his misadventures. Just two days later, the lead ship of the returning India fleet\u2014the ''Anunciada'' under Nicolau Coelho\u2014sailed into Bezeguiche, which must have been a pre-arranged point of encounter for the Second Armada, surprised to find both Dias and the Brazilian mapping expedition there.\n\nFor the next two weeks, the captains and crews of the different ships exchanged tales of their travels and adventures.  It has been since speculated that it was during this time that Amerigo Vespucci came up with his \"[[New World]]\" hypothesis.  After all, Vespucci was quite familiar with the Americas, having participated in Ojeda's 1499 expedition to the coasts of South America, and it is said he had intense discussions at Bezeguiche with Gaspar da Gama, undoubtedly the person most familiar with the East Indies. Comparing notes, it probably dawned on Vespucci that it was simply impossible to square what he knew of the Americas with what the men of the Second Armada knew of Asia.  While still at Bezeguiche, Vespucci wrote a letter to [[Lorenzo de' Medici (1463\u20131503)|Lorenzo di Pierfrancesco de' Medici]], relating his encounter, which he sent back with some Florentine passengers on the ''Anunciada''.<ref>Varnhagen (1865); an English translation can be found in W.H.Greenlee (1938: p.152ff).</ref>  This was a prelude to an even more famous letter of Vespucci to Lorenzo in 1503, shortly after his return, in which he asserts that the Brazilian landmass was in fact a continent and that the lands discovered to the west were definitely not part of Asia, but must be an entirely different continent, a \"[[New World]]\".<ref>Vespucci (1503)</ref><ref group=note>After leaving Bezeguiche, the mapping expedition would make landfall at [[Cape S\u00e3o Roque]] in August 1501, and would proceed to sail south along the Brazilian coast, possibly as far as the S\u00e3o Paulo coast. They returned to Lisbon before September 1502, perhaps as early as June. A second mapping expedition, this time more certainly under Gon\u00e7alo Coelho, also accompanied by Vespucci (his \"fourth voyage\"), set out for Brazil in April 1503.</ref>\n\nIn mid-June, Lemos and Vespucci left Bezeguiche for Brazil. Shortly after, Cabral and Sim\u00e3o de Miranda themselves reached Bezeguiche, where they find Diogo Dias and Nicolau Coelho awaiting them. Cabral sent Coelho's swift ''Anunciada'' ahead to Lisbon to announce their return, while the remainder rested and waited in Bezeguiche for the remaining two ships.  P\u00earo de Ata\u00edde's ship, making its way alone from Mossel Bay, and Sancho de Tovar's ''S\u00e3o Pedro'', returning from Sofala, arrived in Bezeguiche by the end of June.\n\nOn June 23, the ''Anunciada'', commanded by Nicolau Coelho, who had also been the first to deliver the news of Gama's expedition several years earlier, arrived in Lisbon and anchored in [[Bel\u00e9m]]. The merchants of the consortium led by Bartolomeo Marchionni, who own the ''Anunciada'', were delighted.  Letters were immediately fired off throughout Europe announcing the results.\n\nThe news arrives too late for Jo\u00e3o da Nova's 3rd India Armada, however, which departed for India in two months earlier in April. But Nova collected the necessary information along the way from the note in Ata\u00edde's shoe in Mossel Bay, as well as from Cabral's letters in the possession of Ant\u00f3nio Fernandes in Kilwa.\n\nOne month after Coelho's arrival, on July 21, Cabral and Miranda, captaining the two larger ships, finally arrived in Lisbon. The other three ships arrived a few days later: Tovar and Ata\u00edde on July 25 and Dias, with his empty caravel, on July 27.\n\n== Aftermath ==\n{{Refimprove-section|date=April 2020}}\n[[File:Bernardelli - Monumento a Cabral.jpg|thumb|180px|Monument to [[Pedro \u00c1lvares Cabral]] in Lisbon, copy of a Brazilian monument by Rodolpho Bernardelli]]\nOn the surface, Pedro \u00c1lvares Cabral's 2nd Armada had been a failure and the reaction was conspicuously muted.\n\nShip losses were very heavy. Of the thirteen ships sent out, only five returned with cargo (four crown, one private), five were lost at sea, three returned without cargo (Gaspar de Lemos, Lu\u00eds Pires and Diogo Dias).\n\nHuman losses were even more disheartening.  This included all the crews and captains of the four ships lost at the Cape (notably, the celebrated discoverer Bartolomeu Dias).  Another fifty-something Portuguese (including the factor Aires Correia) had been killed in the Calicut massacre.\n\nThen there were the mission failures.  Relative to the instructions given to him in Lisbon, Cabral had failed on nearly every count:\n*1. failed to establish a treaty with the Zamorin of Calicut\u2014indeed, Calicut was now more hostile than ever.\n*2. failed to establish a factory at Calicut (massacred);\n*3. failed to bring the 'Hindu Church' in line (the friars that survived reported the Hindus weren't Christians after all, just 'idolaters');\n*4. failed to make a treaty with Kilwa;\n*5. failed to establish a factory at Sofala (seen from afar by Tovar, but that is all).\n\nOn the other hand, in his defense, Cabral could point to some positive achievements.\n\n*1. opening of friendly relations with Cochin, Canannore and Quilon;\n*2. a factory in Cochin, poorer than Calicut perhaps, but workable;\n*3. discovery of true Christian communities in Cranganore, etc.;\n*4. Sofala was at least discovered and scouted;\n*5. discovery of Brazil, which might serve as a useful staging post for future India runs;\n*6. Diogo Dias's discovery of Madagascar and exploration of the African coast up to Cape Guardafui and the Gulf of Aden was useful information.\n*7. Finally, Cabral did bring back tons of spices, which were off-loaded into the Lisbon warehouses and sold at no small profit for the crown treasury.\n\nHowever, it was the ship and human losses that weighed heavily against Cabral being honored or rewarded. Allegations of 'incompetence' flew easily in the circles that mattered. Although Cabral was initially offered the command of the [[4th Portuguese India Armada (Gama, 1502)|4th Armada]], scheduled for 1502, it seemed more like a ''pro forma'' gesture than a sincere offer.<ref>Subrahmanyam (1997: p.191)</ref> The crown made it clear that Cabral's command would be limited and supervised \u2013 conditions humiliating enough to force Cabral to withdraw his name.  The 4th Armada would be placed under the command of Vasco da Gama.\n\nAlthough the reaction of Portuguese court opinion in 1501, on Cabral's return, was generally low, it ascended retrospectively.  Cabral's discovery of Brazil, initially received as a minor discovery of little interest, turned out to be much more momentous.  The follow-up Brazilian mapping expeditions of 1501-02 and 1503-04, under the captaincy of [[Gon\u00e7alo Coelho]], carrying the Florentine cosmographer [[Amerigo Vespucci]], revealed a massive continent - which Vespucci famously labelled a \"[[New World]]\" (''Mundus Novus'').  The plentitude of [[brazilwood]] (''pau-brasil'') discovered by the mapping expeditions on its shores lured the interest of European cloth industry, and led to the 1505 contract granted to [[Fern\u00e3o de Loronha]] for the commercial exploitation of Brazil. The lucrative brazilwood trade eventually drew competition from French and Spanish interlopers, forcing the Portuguese government to take a more active interest in Cabral's \"[[Name of Brazil|Land of Vera Cruz]]\", finally leading to the establishment of the first Portuguese colonies in [[Colonial Brazil]] in 1532.\n\n== See also ==\n\n* [[Carta de P\u00earo Vaz de Caminha]]\n* [[Portuguese India Armadas]]\n* [[Portuguese India]]\n* [[History of Brazil]]\n\n== Notes ==\n{{Reflist|group=note |30em}}\n\n== References == \n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n== Sources ==\n'''Eyewitness Accounts'''\n\n* [Anonymous Pilot] \"Navigationi del Capitano Pedro Alvares Cabral Scrita per un Piloto Portoghese et Tradotta di Lingua Portoghese in Italiana\", first published in Francanzano Montalbado, 1507, editor, ''Paesi novamente retrovati et Novo Mondo da Alberico Vesputio Florentino intitulato'', Vicenza.

Cabral's armada famously discovered [[Brazil]] for the Portuguese crown along the way. By and large, the Second Armada's diplomatic mission to [[India]] failed, and provoked the opening of hostilities between the [[Kingdom of Portugal]] and the feudal city-state of [[Kozhikode|Calicut]].  Nonetheless, it managed to establish a factory in the nearby [[Kingdom of Cochin]], the first Portuguese [[Factory (trading post)|factory]] in Asia.\n\n== Fleet ==\n\nThe [[1st Portuguese India Armada (Gama, 1497)|first India Armada]], commanded by [[Vasco da Gama]], arrived in Portugal in the summer of 1499, in rather sorry shape. Half of his ships and men had been lost thanks to battles, disease, and storms. Although Gama came back with a hefty cargo of spices that would be sold at enormous profit, he had failed in the principal objective of his mission: to negotiate a treaty with [[Kozhikode|Calicut]], the spice entrep\u00f4t on the [[Malabar Coast]] of India. Gama managed, however, to open the sea route to India via the [[Cape of Good Hope]] and secured good relations with the African city-state of [[Malindi]], a critical staging post along the way.\n\nOn King Manuel I's orders, arrangements were immediately made to begin the assembly of a second armada in [[Cascais]].  Determined not to repeat Gama's mistakes, this one was to be a large and well-armed fleet of 13 ships and 1500 men, laden with valuable gifts and diplomatic letters to win over the potentates of the east.\n\nMany details of the composition of the fleet are missing. Only three ship names are known, and there is some conflict among the sources on the captains.  The following list of ships should not be regarded as authoritative, but as a tentative list compiled from various conflicting accounts.\n\n{| class=\"toccolours\" style=\"border-collapse:collapse\" cellpadding=5\n|style=\"border-bottom:3px solid; background:#efefef;\"|'''Ship Name''' ||style=\"border-bottom:3px solid; background:#efefef;\"|'''Captain'''||style=\"border-bottom:3px solid; background:#efefef;\"|'''Notes'''\n|- valign = top\n| 1. uncertain || D.

The famed navigator Bartolomeu Dias, who was the first to double the Cape of Good Hope, and his brother Diogo Dias, who had served as clerk on Gama's ship, also served as captains. \n\nMost of the ships were either [[carracks]] (''naus'') or [[caravels]], and at least one was a small supply ship, although details on names and tonnage are missing.<ref group=note>Castanheda (1551) claims there were ten carracks and three caravels. The Anonymous Pilot refers to only twelve ships, plus a supply ship.</ref>  At least two ships, Cabral's flagship and Tovar's ''El Rei'', were said to be around 240 tons, that is, about twice the size of the largest ship in the first armada three years prior.\n\nTen ships were destined for [[Kozhikode|Calicut]] (Malabar, India), while the two ships headed by the Dias brothers were destined for [[Sofala]] in East Africa and the supply ship was destined to be scuttled and burnt along the way.<ref group=note>The Sofala destination of the Dias brothers is found in Castanheda (1551). It is confirmed in the Anonymous Pilot.</ref>\n\n[[File:Cabral armada of 1500 (Livro das Armadas).jpg|thumb|250px|left|Fleet of the 2nd India Armada (Cabral, 1500), from the ''Mem\u00f3ria das Armadas'']]\n\nAt least two ships were privately owned and outfitted: Lu\u00eds Pires's ship was owned by Diogo da Silva e Meneses, [[Count of Portalegre]], while Nuno Leit\u00e3o da Cunha's ''Anunciada'' was owned by the king's cousin D. [[\u00c1lvaro of Braganza]], and financed by an Italian consortium composed of the Florentine bankers [[Bartolomeo Marchionni]] and [[Girolamo Sernigi]] and the Genoese Antonio Salvago. The remainder belonged to the Portuguese crown.\n\nAccompanying the expedition as translator was [[Gaspar da Gama]], who was a Jew captured in Angediva by Vasco Gama, as well as four Hindu hostages from Calicut taken by Gama in 1498 during negotiations. Also aboard was the ambassador of the Sultan of Malindi, who had arrived at Portugal with Gama, and was set to return to Malindi with Cabral's expedition.\n\nOther passengers on the expedition included Aires Correia, the designated [[Factor (agent)|factor]] for Calicut, his secretary P\u00earo Vaz de Caminha, Afonso Furtado, the designated factor for Sofala, and clerk Martinho Neto.  Accompanying them on the trip was the royal physician and amateur astronomer, Master [[Jo\u00e3o Faras]], who brought along the latest astrolabe and new Arabic astronomical staves for navigational experiments.  One chronicler suggests that the knight [[Duarte Pacheco Pereira]] was also aboard.<ref group=note>[[Dami\u00e3o de G\u00f3is]] is the chronicler responsible for this claim.  This is not substantiated elsewhere.  Greenlee (1938, p. li) and Diffie and Winius (1977, p. 188fn) dismiss the possibility.</ref>\n\nThe fleet carried some twenty Portuguese ''[[degredado|degredados]]'', who were criminal convicts who could fulfill their sentences by being abandoned along the shores of various places and exploring inland on the crown's behalf. Four of the degredados are known: Afonso Ribeiro, Jo\u00e3o Machado, Luiz de Moura, and Antonio Fernandes, who was also a ship carpenter. \n\nFinally, the fleet carried eight [[Franciscan]] friars and eight chaplains, under the supervision of the head chaplain, Fr. Henrique Soares of Coimbra. They were the first Portuguese Christian missionaries to India.\n\nThere are three surviving eyewitness accounts of this expedition: (1) an extended letter written by P\u00earo Vaz de Caminha (possibly dictated by Aires Correia), written from Brazil on May 1, 1500, to King Manuel I; (2) the brief letter by Mestre [[Jo\u00e3o Faras]] to the king, also from Brazil; and (3) the account of an anonymous Portuguese pilot, first published in Italian in 1507 (commonly referred to as the ''Rela\u00e7\u00e3o do Piloto An\u00f4nimo'', sometimes believed to be the clerk [[Jo\u00e3o de S\u00e1]]).\n\n== Mission ==\n\nThe priority of the mission was to secure a treaty with [[Zamorin]]'s [[Kozhikode|Calicut]] (''Calecute'', Kozhikode), the principal commercial entrep\u00f4t of the [[Kerala]] spice trade and dominant feudal city-state on the [[Malabar coast]] of [[India]]. [[Vasco da Gama]]'s first armada had visited Calicut in 1498, but had failed to impress the elderly ruling Manivikraman Raja ('Samoothiri Raja'), the [[Zamorin of Calicut]]. As such, no agreements had been signed. Cabral's instructions were to succeed where Gama had failed, and to this end was entrusted with magnificent gifts to present to the Zamorin. Cabral was under orders to establish a ''feitoria'' ([[Factory (trading post)|factory]]) in Calicut, which would be placed under Aires Correia.\n\nThe second priority, assigned to Bartolomeu and Diogo Dias, was to search out the East African port of [[Sofala]], near the mouth of the [[Zambezi]] river.<ref>Anonymous Pilot, p. 107</ref> Sofala had been secretly visited and described by the explorer [[P\u00earo da Covilh\u00e3]] during his overland expedition a decade earlier (c. 1487), and he identified it as the endpoint of the [[Monomatapa]] gold trade.  The Portuguese crown was eager to tap into that gold source, but Gama's armada had failed to find it.  The Dias brothers were instructed to find and establish a factory at Sofala under designated factor Afonso Furtado.  To this end, the brothers were likely also instructed to secure the consent of [[Kilwa Sultanate|Kilwa]] (''Qu\u00edloa''), the dominant city-state of the East African coast and putative overlord of Sofala.  \n\nA minor objective included the delivery of a group of [[Franciscan]] missionaries to India. It is said that Vasco da Gama had misinterpreted the [[Hinduism]] he saw practiced in India as a form of \"primitive\" Christianity.  He believed its peculiar characteristics were a result of centuries of separation from the mainstream church in Europe. As such, Gama recommended that missionaries be sent to India to help bring the practices of the \"Hindu church\" up to date with Roman Catholic orthodoxy.  To this end, a group of Franciscan friars, led by Fr. Henrique Soares of Coimbra, joined the expedition.\n\nAs a final objective, the Second Armada was also a commercial spice run. The crown and private merchants who had outfitted the ships expected full cargoes of spices to return to Lisbon. \n\n=== Suspected Brazilian mission ===\n\nThere has been some debate over whether Cabral also had secret instructions from the king to lay claim to the landmass of Brazil\u2014or, more precisely, to swing as far west as possible to the [[Treaty of Tordesillas|Tordesillas line]] and claim whatever lands or islands might be discovered there for the Portuguese crown, before the Spanish did.<ref>{{cite book|last=Peres |first=Dami\u00e3o |date=1949 |title=O descobrimento do Brasil por Pedro \u00c1lvares Cabral: antecedentes e intencionalidade |language=Portuguese}}</ref> Among the pieces of evidence is an indication of an island in the area in a 1448 map of [[Andrea Bianco]], apparently alluded to in the letter of Master Jo\u00e3o Faras; there is also the suggestion by [[Duarte Pacheco Pereira]] in his ''Esmeraldo de Situ Orbis'' that he had been sent on an expedition to a western landmass in 1498.<ref>{{cite book|last=Pacheco Pereira |first=Duarte |date=c. 1505 |title=Esmeraldo de Situ Orbis |url=https://archive.org/details/esmeraldodesitu00peregoog/page/n62/mode/2up |chapter=Cap 2: Da cantidade & grandeza da terra, & daugua qual destas he a mayor parte. |language=Portuguese}}</ref> That is about the full extent of the evidence of intentionality and this claim is largely speculative.<ref>{{cite book|last=Greenlee |first=William Brooks |date=1938 |pages=l\u2013lv |title=The Voyage of Pedro \u00c1lvares Cabral to Brazil and India: from contemporary documents and narratives |publisher=Routledge |isbn=1409414485}}</ref> There are various reasons to presume the existence of such instructions unlikely.\n\nSpanish explorers had certainly been tending south at that time. Christopher Columbus]had touched the coast of the South American mainland around [[Guyana]] in 1498 on his [[Voyages of Christopher Columbus#Third voyage|third trip]]. In late 1499, [[Alonso de Ojeda]] had discovered much of the [[Venezuela|Venezuelan]] coast and in early 1500, [[Vicente Y\u00e1\u00f1ez Pinz\u00f3n]] and [[Diego de Lepe]], via generous southerly swings from the [[Canary islands]], had reached at least what is now [[Cear\u00e1]], and perhaps went as far east as [[Cabo de Santo Agostinho|Cape of Santo Agostinho]] in [[Pernambuco]]. They had explored much of the northern Brazilian coast west of it. It is possible that the southerly Spanish tendencies were deliberate, aimed at securing more land for the Spanish crown.<ref group=note>Although the person from whom the Spanish crown was trying to claim land was not the king of Portugal, as that was already mediated by Tordesillas, but Christopher Columbus, their own vice-roy of the Indies. Ojeda, Pinz\u00f3n, and Lepe were all dispatched on separate royal capitulations by [[Juan Rodr\u00edguez de Fonseca|Bishop Fonseca]], an enemy of Columbus, with the deliberate intent of finding and claiming lands ''outside'' (i.e., to the south) of the Columbus-owned West Indian islands, thereby circumscribing Columbus's viceroyalty and limiting him to the islands he already had. This would figure in later lawsuits by the Columbus family.</ref>\n\nThese expeditions, however, were too recent for their results to have been known in Lisbon before Cabral's departure in March 1500; indeed, they were unknown in Spain itself. It is very doubtful that the Portuguese were aware of them. Even if they were, it would not seem sensible for Cabral's Second Armada to be instructed to deviate from its original mission in India to pursue exploratory work which be far more efficiently accomplished by smaller caravels. \n\n== Outward journey ==\n\n[[File:Cabral armada of 1500 (Livro de Lisuarte de Abreu).jpg|thumb|350px|Fleet of the 2nd India Armada (Cabral, 1500), from the ''Livro de Lisuarte de Abreu'']]\nOn March 9, Cabral's expedition set out from the [[Tagus]]. Thirteen days later, on March 22, Cabral's armada reached the island of [[S\u00e3o Nicolau, Cape Verde|S\u00e3o Nicolau]] in the middle of a storm.  The privately outfitted ship of Lu\u00eds Pires was too damaged by the tempest to continue, and returned to Lisbon<ref>According to Barros (1552, II.5.2 [https://books.google.com/books?id=Epo2AAAAMAAJ&dq=editions%3AUOM39015057112644&lr&as_brr=1&pg=PA386#v=onepage&q&f=false p.386]); also Castanheda (1551), G\u00f3is (1566).</ref><ref group=note>Caminha's eyewitness account made no mention of Pires and instead reported that it was the Vasco de Ataide's crown ship that was lost around Cape Verde.</ref>\n\nFrom Cape Verde, Cabral went southwest. It is unknown why he chose such an unusual direction, but the most probable hypothesis is that he was simply following the wide arc in the South Atlantic to catch a favorable wind to carry them to the Cape of Good Hope. Navigationally, the arc is sensible. From Cape Verde, the ship would cut across the [[doldrums]] below the equator, catch the southwest-bound [[South Equatorial Current|equatorial drift]], and turn into the southbound [[Brazil Current]] that will carry them down to the [[horse latitudes]] (30\u00b0S), where the prevailing [[westerlies]] begin.  The westerlies would easily carry the ships across the South Atlantic around the Cape of Good Hope. If instead of this arc, Cabral attempted to strike southeast from Cape Verde, it would go into the [[Gulf of Guinea]]. To reach the Cape from there would be a struggle, as Cabral would have had to sail against the southeasterly [[trade wind|trade winds]], as well as the [[Benguela Current]]. \n\nHow Cabral knew of this arc is unknown. Most likely, this was precisely the route followed by Gama on his first trip in 1497. The veterans of the first fleet\u2014notably the pilots Alenquer and Escobar\u2014would very likely have charted the same route for Cabral again.<ref group=note>That this arc was sailed by Gama in 1497 is uncertain, but most modern historians have come to accept that he did. How did Gama know about the arc when no one had yet sailed it before? Some have speculated that the Portuguese crown might have dispatched secret exploratory expeditions to those waters in advance. The more widely accepted hypothesis, first forwarded by admiral [[Gago Coutinho]], is more straightforward: Since Bartolomeu Dias's 1488 expedition discovered the westerlies, the South Atlantic arc became \"navigationally obvious\" to any sensible pilot, especially pilots as experienced as Alenquer and Escobar. See Gago Coutinho (1951\u201352) ''A Nautica dos Descobrimentos: os descobrimentos maritimos visitos por um navegador'', 2 vols., Lisbon: Agencia Geral do Ultramar.</ref> Indeed, in the Lisbon archives, there is a draft of a document intended for Cabral that instructs him to strike in a southwesterly direction when he reaches the doldrums.<ref>After Cape Verde, where the wind is weak ('vento escasso') the ships should strike in the open ocean arc ('ir na volta do mar'), until the Cape of Good Hope, as this is the shorter route ('a navega\u00e7\u00e3o ser\u00e1 mais breve'). See Fonseca (1908, p. 211; see also p.224) [https://books.google.com/books?id=A7lI4gqh7PsC&pg=PA208#v=onepage&q&f=false copy of letter]; see also Greenlee (1938, p. 167)</ref> \n\nAlternative hypotheses forwarded for Cabral striking southwest are that he was trying to reach the [[Azores]] to repair his storm-battered fleet, that he was searching for and rounding up missing tempest-tossed ships, or that it was an intentional attempt to discover if there was any land by the Tordesillas line.\n\n=== Discovery of Brazil ===\n\nCabral took the same path as Gama had, but made a slightly wider arc and went further west than Gama had. As a result, he hit upon the hitherto unknown landmass of Brazil. After nearly 30 days of sailing (44 since departure), on April 21, Cabral's fleet found the first indications of nearby land.<ref>{{cite book|last=Fonseca |first=Faustino da |date=1908 |page=225 |title=A Descoberta to Brasil |language=Portuguese |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=A7lI4gqh7PsC&pg=PA208#v=onepage&q&f=false |publisher=Livraria Central de Gomes de Carvalho |place=Lisbon}}</ref> The next day, the armada caught sight of the Brazilian coast, seeing the outlines of a hill they named [[Monte Pascoal]].\n\nThe armada anchored at the mouth of the [[Do Frade River|Frade river]] the next day, and a group of local [[Tupiniquim]] Indians assembled on the beach. Cabral dispatched a small party, headed by Nicolau Coelho, in a longboat ashore to make first contact. Coelho tossed his hat in exchange for a feathered headdress, but the surf was too strong for a proper landing and opening of communication, so they returned to the ships.<ref>{{cite book|last=Fonseca |first=Faustino da |date=1908 |pages=241\u2013242 |title=A Descoberta to Brasil |language=Portuguese |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=A7lI4gqh7PsC&pg=PA208#v=onepage&q&f=false |publisher=Livraria Central de Gomes de Carvalho |place=Lisbon}}</ref>\n\nStrong overnight winds prompted the armada to lift anchor and sail some 10 leagues (45&nbsp;km) north, finding harbor behind the reef at Cabr\u00e1lia Bay, just north of [[Porto Seguro]].  The pilot Afonso Lopes, while [[Sounding line|sounding]] in a rowboat, spotted a native canoe, captured the two Indians on board, and brought them back to ship. The language barrier prevented questioning, but they were fed and given cloth and beads. The cultural difference was apparent: The natives spat out their honey and cake and were deeply surprised upon seeing a chicken.<ref>Guia politicamente incorreto da Hist\u00f3ria do Brasil, Leandro Narloch</ref>\n\nThe next day, on April 25, a party led by Coelho and Bartolomeu Dias went ashore, accompanied by the two natives. Armed Tupiniquim warily approached the beach, but upon a signal from the two natives, set down their bows, and allowed the Portuguese to land and collect water.\n\n[[File:Meirelles-primeiramissa2.jpg|thumb|right|250px|''The First Mass in Brazil'' by [[Victor Meirelles]] (1861)]]\n\nOn April 26, the Octave of Easter Sunday, the Franciscan friar Henrique Soares of Coimbra went ashore to celebrate mass in front of 200 Tupiniquim Indians.  This is the first known Christian mass on the American mainland.\n\nInteraction between the Portuguese and the Tupiniquim gradually increased throughout the week.  European iron nails, cloth, beads, and crucifixes were traded for American amulets, spears, parrots, and monkeys. There was only the slightest hint that precious metals might be found in the hinterlands. Portuguese ''degredados'' are assigned to spend the night in Tupiniquim villages, while the rest of the crew sleeps aboard ships.\n\n[[File:Carta-caminha.png|thumb|150px|Facsimile of P\u00earo Vaz de Caminha's letter to the king, reporting the discovery of the \"Island of the True Cross\" (Brazil)]]\n\nOn May 1, Cabral makes preparations to resume the journey to India. The Portuguese pilots, assisted by the physician-astronomer Master Jo\u00e3o Faras, determined that Brazil lay east of the Tordesillas line, prompting Cabral to formally claim it for the Portuguese crown, bestowing upon it the name of ''Ilha de Vera Cruz'' (\"Island  of the True Cross\"). It was later renamed ''Terra de Santa Cruz''\u2014\"Land of the Holy Cross\"\u2014upon the realization that it was not an island).<ref group=note>Gaspar Correia ([https://books.google.com/books?id=YmVKAAAAYAAJ&dq=editions%3ALCCN05022145&as_brr=1&pg=PA152#v=onepage&q&f=false p.152]) and Jo\u00e3o de Barros ([https://books.google.com/books?id=Epo2AAAAMAAJ&dq=editions%3AUOM39015057112644&lr&as_brr=1&pg=PA391#v=onepage&q&f=false p.391]) say it was named \"Santa Cruz\" from the start, with Correia saying it was named so because the departure date was the [[Feast of the Cross]] on the liturgical calendar. However, both Caminha's and Mestre Jo\u00e3o's letters are signed as written from \"Vera Cruz\" on May 1.</ref>\n\nOn May 2, Cabral dispatched the supply ship back to [[Lisbon]], with the Brazilian items and a letter to King Manuel I composed by the secretary P\u00earo Vaz de Caminha to announce the discovery.<ref>Anonymous Pilot [https://books.google.com/books?id=eCsOAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA110#v=onepage&q&f=false p.110]</ref> It also carried a separate private letter to the king from Master [[Jo\u00e3o Faras]], in which he identified the main guiding constellation in the southern hemisphere, the [[Southern Cross]] (''Cruzeiro'').<ref>Some sources claim that the ''Cruzeiro'' constellation had already been identified by [[Alvise Cadamosto]] in the 1450s.</ref> The supply ship arrived in Lisbon in June.\n\nAfter that, with a couple of Portuguese ''degredados'' left beind with the Tupiniquim of Porto Seguro,<ref>Anonymous Pilot [https://books.google.com/books?id=eCsOAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA110#v=onepage&q&f=false p.110]</ref> Cabral ordered the eleven remaining ships to set sail and continue on their route to India.\n\n=== Crossing to India ===\n\nAfter crossing the Atlantic Ocean, Cabral's armada reached the Cape of Good Hope in late May.  The fleet faced headlong winds for six straight days and four ship\u2014Bartolomeu Dias's, Aires Gomes da Silva's, Sim\u00e3o de Pina's, and Vasco de Ata\u00edde's\u2014are lost at sea in the process.<ref>Castanheda (1551)</ref><ref>Barros (1552)</ref><ref>G\u00f3is (1566)</ref><ref group=note>The ''Rela\u00e7ao das Naos'' mistakenly substitutes Sim\u00e3o de Miranda for Sim\u00e3o da Pina in the losses, although this is corrected in the marginal gloss. Gaspar Correia (1550) almost concurs\u2014but as he does not have Aires Gomes da Silva on his original captain list, he identifies the fourth ship lost as Gaspar de Lemos. Similarly, the ''Livro de Lisuarte d'Abreu'' (1563), which has neither Pina nor Gomes da Silva on its list, say it was Diogo de Figueir\u00f3 and Luis Pires who were lost.  Diogo do Couto (c.1600) mistakenly adds P\u00earo d'Ataide to the list, bringing the losses to five. Some scholars also contend that Pires was lost at this point, and Vasco de Ata\u00edde had been lost earlier at Cape Verde.</ref> In this way, the fleet was reduced to seven ships. Facing strong winds, the armada split into smaller groups to meet again on the other side. Cabral's ship went with two others.\n\nOn June 16, 1500, Cabral's three-ship squadron reached the [[Primeiras and Segundas Archipelago|Primeiras Islands]] several leagues north of Sofala.  Two local merchant ships, catching sight of Cabral, took flight. Cabral gave pursuit\u2014one of them runs aground and the other is captured. Upon questioning, it was discovered that these ships were owned by a cousin of the sultan Fateima of Malindi (who had received Vasco da Gama in 1498), so they were released. \n\nThe three ships landed on [[Mozambique Island]] on June 22. Despite the earlier quarrel with his ships, Cabral was given a warm reception by the Sultan of Mozambique and was allowed to collect water and supplies.  Shortly after, three more ships of the Second Armada sailed into the island and joined with Cabral.  Only the ship of Diogo Dias remained missing.  As Dias's mission was for Sofala anyway, Cabral decided not to wait for it and instead pressed on with his fleet of six ships.\n\n[[File:Map of Cabral route, 1500.gif|thumb|340px|Approximate route of outward journey of Cabral's 2nd Armada (also route of stray ship of Diogo Dias)]]\n\nMore than a month later, on July 26, Cabral's armada reached [[Kilwa Kisiwani|Kilwa]], the dominant city-state of the East African coast and which Gama had never visited. Afonso Furtado, who had been appointed factor for Sofala in Lisbon and had escaped death (Furtado had been aboard Bartolomeu Dias's ship, but moved to the flagship just before the Cape crossing), went ashore to open negotiations with the strongman ruler, Emir Ibrahim.<ref group=note>At the time, there was no ruling [[Kilwa Sultanate|Sultan of Kilwa]] as the previous one, al-Fudail, had been deposed in a coup (c. 1495) by his minister, Emir Ibrahim, who had since ruled Kilwa with a vacant throne.</ref>\n\nA meeting was arranged between Cabral and Ibrahim, conducted on a couple of rowboats in the harbor. Cabral presents a letter from King Manuel I proposing a treaty, but Ibrahim was suspicious and remained resistant to the overtures. Cabral, sensing Ibrahim's resistance and worrying that they might miss the monsoon winds to India, broke off the negotiations and sailed on.\n\nPressing north, the Cabral fleet avoided the hostile [[Mombassa]] (''Momba\u00e7a'') and finally reached friendly Malindi (''Melinde'') on August 2.  There, he was well-received by the Sultan of Malindi and dropped off the Malindi ambassador that Gama had taken the previous year.  Leaving behind  two ''degredados'', Lu\u00eds de Moura and Jo\u00e3o Machado, and picking up two Gujarati pilots, Cabral's six-ship armada finally began its Indian Ocean crossing on August 7, 1500.\n\n== Cabral in India ==\n{{Refimprove-section|date=April 2020}}\nAfter an uneventful ocean crossing, Cabral's six ships landed on [[Anjediva Island]] (''Angediva'', Anjadip) on August 22, where they rested and repaired and repainted the ships.\n\nSailing down the Indian coast, Cabral's expedition finally reached [[Kozhikode|Calicut]] on September 13. Gaily decorated native boats came out to greet them, but remembering Gama's experience, Cabral refused to go ashore until hostages were exchanged. He dispatched Afonso Furtado and the four Calicut hostages taken by Gama the previous year to negotiate the details of the landing. When the negotiation was complete, Cabral finally went ashore himself and met the new Zamorin of Calicut. Cabral presents him with much finer and more luxurious gifts than Gama had brought, and more respectful and personalized letters of address from King Manuel I of Portugal.\n\nA commercial treaty was successfully negotiated and the Zamorin gave Cabral a security-of-trade certificate etched on a silver plate. The Portuguese were permitted to establish a ''feitoria]]'' in Calicut. Aires Correia went ashore with around 70 men. Once the factory was set up, Cabral released the ship hostages as a sign of trust and Correia set about buying spices in Calicut's markets for the ships to take home.\n\nSometime in October, the Zamorin of Calicut dispatched a service request to Cabral's idling fleet. Arab merchants allied with the rival city-state of [[Cochin kingdom|Cochin]] were returning from [[Ceylon]] with a cargo of war elephants destined for the Sultan of [[Cambay]]. Claiming it to be illegal contraband, the Zamorin asked Cabral to intercept them. Cabral sent one of his caravels under P\u00earo de Ata\u00edde to capture it.  Hoping for a spectacle, the Zamorin himself came down to the beachfront to witness the engagement, but left in disgust when the Arab ship slipped past Ataide, who gave chase and eventually caught up to it near Cannanore] He successfully seized the vessel and Cabral presented the captured ship, with its nearly intact elephant cargo, to the Zamorin as a gift.\n\n=== Calicut Massacre ===\n\nBy December of 1500, factor Aires Correia was still only able to buy enough spices to load two of the ships. He complained to Cabral his suspicions that the guild of Arab merchants in Calicut had been colluding to shut out Portuguese purchasing agents from the city's spice markets. Arab traders had reportedly used similar tactics to drive out Chinese merchants earlier in the 15th century from various ports on the [[Malabar Coast]]. Correia thought that it would make sense if they repeated this, particularly as the Portuguese had been clear with their hatred of \"the Moors\" and had demanded trading privileges and preferences.<ref group=note>Historians now think that the Portuguese traders may have in fact been unwitting counters in ongoing quarrels between competing older and newer Arab merchant guilds in Calicut. They may also have been used as pawns in the personal power struggles among the Zamorin's leading advisors.</ref>\n\nCabral presented Correia's complaint to the Zamorin, and requested that he crack down on the Arab merchant guild or enforce Portuguese priority in the spice markets. But the Zamorin refused Cabral's demand that he actively intervene in the market. \n\nFrustrated by the Zamorin's inaction, Cabral decided to take matters into his own hands. On December 17, on the advice of Aires Correia, Cabral ordered the seizure of an Arab merchant ship from [[Jeddah]], which had been loaded up with spices. He claimed that the Zamorin had promised the Portuguese priority in the spice markets, and so the cargo was rightfully theirs. Incensed, the Arab merchants around the quay immediately raised a riot in Calicut and direct mobs to attack the Portuguese factory. The Portuguese ships, anchored out in the harbor and unable to approach the docks, could only watch the unfolding massacre. After three hours of fighting, 53 (though some sources say 70) Portuguese were slaughtered by the mobs\u2014including the factor Aires Correia, the secretary Caminha, and three (some say five) of the Franciscan friars.  Around twenty Portuguese in the city managed to escape the riot by jumping into the harbor waters and swimming to the ships. The survivors reported to Cabral that the Zamorin's own guards were seen either standing aside or actively helping the rioters. At least one Portuguese, a man called Gon\u00e7alo Peixoto, was sheltered from the mob by a local merchant (whom the chronicles call \"Coja Bequij\") and survived the massacre. \n\nAfter the Calicut massacre, the wares in the Portuguese factory were impounded by the Calicut authorities.\n\n=== War with Calicut ===\n\nIncensed at the attack on the factory, Cabral waited one day for redress by the Zamorin.  When this did not arrive, Cabral and the Portuguese seized around ten Arab merchant ships then in harbor between December 18 and 22. They confiscated the ships' cargoes, killed the crews, and burned their ships. Then, accusing the Zamorin of sanctioning the riot, Cabral ordered a full day [[shore bombardment]] of Calicut, doing immense damage to the unfortified city. Estimates of Calicut casualties reach up to 600. Cabral proceeded to also bomb the nearby Zamorin-owned port of Pandarane.<ref group=note>The port of Pandarane has since disappeared. Its location is usually identified as 'Pantalyini Kollam', a port that has since been annexed by the growing city of [[Koyilandy]]; it is also sometimes identified with modern [[Kappad]]. (Dames, 1918, p.85)</ref>\n\nThis marked the beginning of the war between the Kingdom of Portugal and the Zamorin of Calicut. The war dragged on for the next decade and became an important focus of future armadas. It ultimately dictated Portuguese strategy in the Indian Ocean and overturned the political order on the Malabar Coast of India.\n\n=== Alliance with Cochin kingdom ===\n\n[[File:Kerala cities at time of Cabral (1500).gif|thumb|250px|India Malabar Coast c. 1500]]\nOn December 24, Cabral left the smoldering Calicut, unsure of what to do next. At the suggestion of Gaspar da Gama, the Goese Jew who had been accompanying the expedition, Cabral set sail south along the coast toward Cochin kingdom (''Cochim'', Kochi or Perumpadappu Swarupam), a small Hindu [[Nair]] city-state at the outlet of the [[Vembanad Lake|Vembanad lagoon]] in the Kerala backwaters. Partly in vassalage to and partly at war with Zamorin's Calicut, Cochin had long chafed at the dominance of its larger neighbor and was looking for an opportunity to break away.\n\nArriving in Cochin, a Portuguese emissary and a [[Saint Thomas Christians|Christian]] picked up in Calicut went ashore to make contact with the Trimumpara Raja (Unni Goda Varma), the Nair Hindu prince of Cochin.<ref group=note>The exact status of the Trimumpara Raja is a bit unclear.  It seems that the formal ruler of Cochin was the king of [[Edapalli]], which was across the lagoon on the mainland, but that the Cochinese peninsula (with capital at [[Perumpadappu (Malappuram district)|Perumpadappu]]) had at some point been detached as an appanage for a son, who, in turn, had detached the northern tip, Cochin proper, for another son. Moreover, it seems that these appanages were not supposed to be permanent fiefs, but rather to serve as temporary \"training grounds\" for princely heirs before they moved up in succession order. In other words, the ruler of Cochin was the second heir of Edapalli. Upon the death of the ruler of Edapalli, the first heir was meant to leave the peninsula and take up his duties in Edapalli, and the second heir would from Cochin to Perumpadappu, and assign Cochin to his own successor (the new second heir). The Portuguese seem to have arrived at a time when the princely heirs were somewhat at odds with one another, for some reason or another. It was only under Portuguese protection that the rulers of Cochin finally became proper kings in their own right.  Thus the Raja Trimumpara's search for a Portuguese alliance possibly had more to do with his own family quarrels than with the exactions of the Zamorin of Calicut.  See Dames (1918: p.86n).</ref> The Portuguese were greeted warmly, with the bombardment of Calicut outweighing the earlier matter of the war elephants. With all the cordialities and hostage-swapping completed quickly, Cabral himself went ashore and negotiated a treaty of alliance between Portugal and Cochin, directed against Zamorin's Calicut. Cabral promised to make the Trimumpara Raja of Cochin the ruler of kingdom of Calicut upon the city's capture.\n\nA Portuguese factory is set up in Cochin, with Gon\u00e7alo Gil Barbosa as chief factor. The spice markets of the smaller Cochin were not nearly as well-supplied as those of Calicut, but the trade was good enough to begin loading ships.  The stay in Cochin was not, however, without incident. The factory was set ablaze one evening, likely at the instigation of Arab traders in the city. The Trimumpara Raja, in contrast with the Zamorin of Calicut, cracked down on the arsonists. He took the Portuguese under his protection by having the factors stay in his palace and assigned his personal Nair guards to escort the factors in the city markets and protect the factory against further incidents.\n\nIn early January of 1501, while in Cochin, Cabral received missives from the rulers of Cannanore (''Canonor'', Kannur or Kolathunad), one of Calicut's reluctant rivals in the north, and [[Quilon]] (''Coul\u00e3o'', Kollam or Venad Swarupam), which was further south and had once been a great Syrian Christian merchant city-state, being an entrep\u00f4t for cinnamon, ginger, and dyewood.  They commended Cabral's actions against Calicut and invited the Portuguese to trade in their cities instead. Not wishing to offend his Cochinese host, Cabral declined the invitations, only promising to visit the cities at some future date.\n\nWhile still in Cochin, Cabral received yet another invitation, this one from the nearby [[Kodungallur Kovilakam|Cranganore kingdom]] (''Cranganor'', Kodungallur). The once-great capital of the [[Chera dynasty]] of [[Sangam period]] had recently been facing various natural disasters. The channels that connected Cranganore to the waterways were silted up, breaking open a competing sea outlet by Cochin in the 14th century.<ref group=note>Cochin was originally just a village along a long embankment.  Violent overflows of the [[Periyar River]] in 1341 forced the opening of the outlet between the Vembanad lagoon and the Arabian Sea at the juncture where Cochin now sits, separating the long Cochinese peninsula from what is now [[Vypin]] island. See Hunter's ''Imperial Gazetteer'' (1908, p.360).</ref> Cochin's rise had been principally due to the re-routing of commercial traffic away from Cranganore. Nonetheless, the remaining merchants of the dwindling city still maintained their old connections to the Kerala pepper plantations in the interior. Finding the supply in Cochin running low, Cabral took up the offer to load some cargo at Cranganore.\n\nThe visit to Cranganore turned out to be an eye-opener for the Portuguese, for among the city's remaining inhabitants are substantial established communities of [[Cochin Jews|Malabari Jews]] and [[Syrian Malabar Nasrani|Syrian Christians]].  The encounter with a clearly recognizable Christian community in Kerala confirmed to Cabral what the Franciscan friars had already suspected back in Calicut, namely that Vasco da Gama's earlier hypothesis about a \"Hindu Church\" was mistaken. If real Christians had existed alongside Hindus in India for centuries, after all, then clearly Hinduism must be a distinct religion. Hindus were \"heathen idolaters\", as the Portuguese friars characterized them, rather than adherents to a \"primitive\" form of Christianity.  Two Syrian Christian priests from Cranganore applied to Cabral for passage to Europe.<ref group=note>One of these priests, known as Jos\u00e9 de Cranganore or Joseph the Indian (''Josephus Indus''), eventually would provide instrumental intelligence about India to the Portuguese. Upon arrival in Lisbon, Joseph the Indian spent a couple of years being intensely interviewed by the Portuguese court and the [[Casa da \u00cdndia]], relating to them his detailed knowledge of the history and geography of India and the east, expanding Portuguese intelligence dramatically. It is likely that the detailed depiction of the east Indian coast and the [[Bay of Bengal]] in the [[Cantino planisphere]] of 1502 is owed in large part to this information.  Around 1503, Joseph went to Rome to meet [[Pope Alexander VI]] and report on the condition of the Malabari Syrian Christian church.  It was on this trip that Joseph dictated his famous narrative on India to an Italian scribe, which was eventually published in 1507 (in Italian) as part of a collection, ''Paesi Novamente Retrovati'', edited by Fracanzio da Montalboddo.  The narrative includes Joseph's own account of Cabral's expedition.  See Vallavanthara (2001).</ref>\n\nOn January 16, 1501, news arrived that the Zamorin of Calicut had assembled and dispatched a fleet of around 80 boats against the Portuguese in Cochin.  Despite the Trimumpara Raja of Cochin's offer of military assistance against the Calicut fleet, Cabral decided to precipitously lift anchor and slip away rather than risk a confrontation. Cabral's armada left behind the factor Gon\u00e7alo Gil Barbosa and six assistants in Cochin. In their hasty departure, the Portuguese inadvertently took along two of the Trimumpara's officers (Idikkela Menon and Parangoda Mennon), who had been serving as hostages aboard the vessels.\n\nHeading north, Cabral's armada took a wide sweep to avoid Calicut, and paid a quick visit to Cannanore. Cabral was warmly received by the [[Kolathiri]] Raja of Cannanore who, eager for a Portuguese alliance, offered to sell the Portuguese spices on credit. Cabral accepted the cargo but paid him nonetheless. Even though the cargo turned out to only be low-quality ginger, Cabral was appreciative of the gesture. \n\nHis ships now filled with spices, Cabral decided not to visit Quilon, as he had earlier promised, but to make way back home to Portugal instead.\n\n== Diogo Dias's misadventures ==\n{{Unreferenced-section|date=April 2020}}\nWhile Cabral's main fleet was in India, Diogo Dias, captain of the missing seventh ship of the armada, was going through his own set of adventures. \n\n[[File:Detail of Diogo Dias's ship (Cabral Armada).jpg|thumb|180px|Ship of [[Diogo Dias]], detail from the ''Mem\u00f3ria das Armadas'']]\n\nShortly after being separated from the main fleet at the Cape in June 1500, Dias had struck out too far east into the Indian Ocean and sighted the western coast of the island of [[Madagascar]].  Although the island was not unknown (its Arab name, \"island of the Moon\", was already reported by [[Pero de Covilha]]), Dias was the first Portuguese captain to have sighted it and is often credited with renaming it the island of ''S\u00e3o Louren\u00e7o'', on account of it being found on [[St. Lawrence]]'s day (August 10, 1500).  However, a proper landing on Madagascar would not be undertaken until 1506 and it would only be extensively explored in 1508. \n\nLikely thinking that he was on a South African island, Dias tried to find the African coast by sailing straight north from Madagascar, hoping to reconnect with Cabral's armada there, or to make it to Sofala, Dias's official destination. But he had struck too far east and was in fact in open ocean.  Dias sighted the African coast only around [[Mogadishu]] (''Magadoxo''), by which point Cabral had already crossed the Indian Ocean. The change in the monsoon winds prevented Dias from undertaking his own crossing. Dias pushed up the coast, unexpectedly passing [[Cape Guardafui]] into the [[Gulf of Aden]], waters previously unexplored by Portuguese ships.  Dias spent the next few months in the area. He was trapped by contrary winds, battered by tempests, attacked by Arab pirates, and forced aground on the Eritrean coast, unable to find food and water.\n\nEventually, in late 1500 and early 1501, Dias managed to procure supplies, repair his ship, and catch a favorable wind to take him out of the gulf. With his remaining six crewmen, Dias set sail back to Portugal, hoping to catch Cabral's armada on the return journey.\n\n== Return journey ==\n{{Unreferenced-section|date=April 2020}}\nIn late January of 1501, Cabral took aboard an ambassador from Cannanore and started his ocean crossing back to East Africa.  On the way, the Portuguese captured a Gujarati ship, replete with a magnificent cargo.  They stole the cargo, but, upon realizing that the crewmen were not Arabs, spared them.\n\nAs Cabral's expedition approached Malindi in February, vice-admiral Sancho de Tovar, sailing at the front, ran his spice-laden ship, the ''El Rei'', aground on the Malindi coast. The great ship was irreparable. To recover the iron fittings, it was burnt, and the crew and the cargo were reallocated.  Cabral authorized the king of Malindi to recover the cannons from the wreck and keep them for himself.\n\nCabral's fleet, reduced to just five ships, reached Mozambique Island in the spring. As there was no news from Diogo Dias, Cabral decided to take responsibility for the Sofala mission himself. Cabral ordered the private ship ''Anunciada'' of Nuno Leit\u00e3o da Cunha, the fastest in the fleet, to be placed under the command of veteran hand Nicolau Coelho. He dispatched it ahead of the rest of the fleet to deliver the results of the voyage to Portugal. Tovar took command of the caravel ''S\u00e3o Pedro'', previously commanded by P\u00earo de Ata\u00edde, with the intent to seek out Sofala and proceed home alone from there. Ata\u00edde was transferred to the command of Coelho's old nau. \n\nIn the meantime, Cabral landed the ''degredado'' Ant\u00f3nio Fernandes on the African coast, with letters of instruction for Diogo Dias and any passing Portuguese expeditions, informing them of the dramatic turn of events in India, and warning them to avoid Calicut. It is uncertain exactly where Cabral left Ant\u00f3nio Fernandes or where he was ordered to go. According to Ata\u00edde, Fernandes was ordered to go to Mombassa, which was odd, as Mombassa was at the time on hostile terms with the Portuguese; others suggest he was supposed to go to Kilwa (which is where the [[3rd Portuguese India Armada (Nova, 1501)|Third Armada]] of [[Jo\u00e3o da Nova]] eventually found him). Others have speculated that Fernandes was left in Kilwa on the outward leg, and that Cabral's letters were dispatched to him by a local messenger from Mozambique on the return. It is also possible that Fernandes had been instructed to make his way to Sofala overland, meet Tovar's ship there, and then proceed to explore inland from there to locate [[Monomatapa]], though this does not explain why Cabral had given him the letters. Finally, some conjecture that Fernandes here is in fact another ''degredado'', Jo\u00e3o Machado, who had been left in Malindi on the first leg. Machado, it is thought, may have been picked up on the return and was sent back once again with the letters. \n\nMatters settled, Cabral took the remaining three ships\u2014his own flagship, the large nau of Sim\u00e3o de Miranda, and Coelho's ship (now under P\u00earo de Ata\u00edde)\u2014and set sail out of Mozambique Island.\n\nAta\u00edde became separated from the other two in the [[Mozambique Channel]] soon after departure. He hurried to [[Mossel Bay|S\u00e3o Br\u00e1s]], hoping to find Cabral there waiting for him. But Cabral and Miranda had decided to proceed on together towards Lisbon without him, so Ata\u00edde made his way home alone, leaving behind a letter in a boot by a local watering hole giving an account of the expedition; Ataide's note would be found later that year by Jo\u00e3o da Nova's third armada.\n\nIn the meantime, Sancho de Tovar, aboard the ''S\u00e3o Pedro'', finally caught sight of Sofala, the entrep\u00f4t of Monomatapa gold. He stayed in his ship, scouting the city from there, before setting sail back home alone.\n\n=== Conference at Bezeguiche ===\n\nOn June 2, 1501, following up on the discovery of Brazil the previous year, King Manuel I of Portugal assembled a small exploratory expedition of three caravels under an unnamed Portuguese captain  to explore and map the coast of Brazil. Aboard the ship was the Florentine cosmographer Amerigo Vespucci.  The exact identity of the captain is uncertain. Some speculate it to have been the commander of the supply vessel that had delivered the news a year earlier (either Lemos or Gon\u00e7alves); others conjecture the commander went as a passenger and that the expedition itself was commanded by [[Gon\u00e7alo Coelho]].<ref group=note>Amerigo Vespucci wrote two detailed accounts of this expedition\u2014in ''Mundus Novus'' (pub. 1502/03) and as the \"third voyage\" in ''Lettera a Soderini'' (pub.1504/05)\u2014but does not identify the Portuguese captain by name in either. Chronicler Gaspar Correia, writing a half-century later, identifies the mapping captain as the same captain who steered the returning supply ship.  Greenlee (1945) suggests the captain was [[Fern\u00e3o de Loronha]], although this has been dismissed by others (e.g., Roukema, 1963). More recently, historians have drawn attention to a nautical chart by [[Vesconte de Maggiolo]], which identifies the Brazilian landmass with the label ''Tera de Gonsalvo Coigo Vocatur Santa Cruz'' (translated as \"Land of Gon\u00e7alo Coelho called Santa Cruz\"). \u00a0Gon\u00e7alo Coelho is known to have led a later expedition to Brazil, which set out in 1503, but it is commonly estimated that Coelho was still out at sea when Maggiolo composed his chart (c. 1504-05), thereby suggesting that Coelho might have also captained the previous 1501 mapping expedition as well. (Morison, 1974, vol. 2, p.281)</ref> Setting out from Lisbon in May 1501, the expedition made a watering stop in early June at Bezeguiche, as the bay of [[Dakar]], near present-day Senegal, was known to the Portuguese sailors of the time. There, they stumbled upon Diogo Dias, who related to the Portuguese captain and Vespucci the tales of his misadventures. Just two days later, the lead ship of the returning India fleet\u2014the ''Anunciada'' under Nicolau Coelho\u2014sailed into Bezeguiche, which must have been a pre-arranged point of encounter for the Second Armada, surprised to find both Dias and the Brazilian mapping expedition there.\n\nFor the next two weeks, the captains and crews of the different ships exchanged tales of their travels and adventures.  It has been since speculated that it was during this time that Amerigo Vespucci came up with his \"[[New World]]\" hypothesis.  After all, Vespucci was quite familiar with the Americas, having participated in Ojeda's 1499 expedition to the coasts of South America, and it is said he had intense discussions at Bezeguiche with Gaspar da Gama, undoubtedly the person most familiar with the East Indies. Comparing notes, it probably dawned on Vespucci that it was simply impossible to square what he knew of the Americas with what the men of the Second Armada knew of Asia.  While still at Bezeguiche, Vespucci wrote a letter to [[Lorenzo de' Medici (1463\u20131503)|Lorenzo di Pierfrancesco de' Medici]], relating his encounter, which he sent back with some Florentine passengers on the ''Anunciada''.<ref>Varnhagen (1865); an English translation can be found in W.H.Greenlee (1938: p.152ff).</ref>  This was a prelude to an even more famous letter of Vespucci to Lorenzo in 1503, shortly after his return, in which he asserts that the Brazilian landmass was in fact a continent and that the lands discovered to the west were definitely not part of Asia, but must be an entirely different continent, a \"[[New World]]\".<ref>Vespucci (1503)</ref><ref group=note>After leaving Bezeguiche, the mapping expedition would make landfall at [[Cape S\u00e3o Roque]] in August 1501, and would proceed to sail south along the Brazilian coast, possibly as far as the S\u00e3o Paulo coast. They returned to Lisbon before September 1502, perhaps as early as June. A second mapping expedition, this time more certainly under Gon\u00e7alo Coelho, also accompanied by Vespucci (his \"fourth voyage\"), set out for Brazil in April 1503.</ref>\n\nIn mid-June, Lemos and Vespucci left Bezeguiche for Brazil. Shortly after, Cabral and Sim\u00e3o de Miranda themselves reached Bezeguiche, where they find Diogo Dias and Nicolau Coelho awaiting them. Cabral sent Coelho's swift ''Anunciada'' ahead to Lisbon to announce their return, while the remainder rested and waited in Bezeguiche for the remaining two ships.  P\u00earo de Ata\u00edde's ship, making its way alone from Mossel Bay, and Sancho de Tovar's ''S\u00e3o Pedro'', returning from Sofala, arrived in Bezeguiche by the end of June.\n\nOn June 23, the ''Anunciada'', commanded by Nicolau Coelho, who had also been the first to deliver the news of Gama's expedition several years earlier, arrived in Lisbon and anchored in [[Bel\u00e9m]]. The merchants of the consortium led by Bartolomeo Marchionni, who own the ''Anunciada'', were delighted.  Letters were immediately fired off throughout Europe announcing the results.\n\nThe news arrives too late for Jo\u00e3o da Nova's 3rd India Armada, however, which departed for India in two months earlier in April. But Nova collected the necessary information along the way from the note in Ata\u00edde's shoe in Mossel Bay, as well as from Cabral's letters in the possession of Ant\u00f3nio Fernandes in Kilwa.\n\nOne month after Coelho's arrival, on July 21, Cabral and Miranda, captaining the two larger ships, finally arrived in Lisbon. The other three ships arrived a few days later: Tovar and Ata\u00edde on July 25 and Dias, with his empty caravel, on July 27.\n\n== Aftermath ==\n{{Refimprove-section|date=April 2020}}\n[[File:Bernardelli - Monumento a Cabral.jpg|thumb|180px|Monument to [[Pedro \u00c1lvares Cabral]] in Lisbon, copy of a Brazilian monument by Rodolpho Bernardelli]]\nOn the surface, Pedro \u00c1lvares Cabral's 2nd Armada had been a failure and the reaction was conspicuously muted.\n\nShip losses were very heavy. Of the thirteen ships sent out, only five returned with cargo (four crown, one private), five were lost at sea, three returned without cargo (Gaspar de Lemos, Lu\u00eds Pires and Diogo Dias).\n\nHuman losses were even more disheartening.  This included all the crews and captains of the four ships lost at the Cape (notably, the celebrated discoverer Bartolomeu Dias).  Another fifty-something Portuguese (including the factor Aires Correia) had been killed in the Calicut massacre.\n\nThen there were the mission failures.  Relative to the instructions given to him in Lisbon, Cabral had failed on nearly every count:\n*1. failed to establish a treaty with the Zamorin of Calicut\u2014indeed, Calicut was now more hostile than ever.\n*2. failed to establish a factory at Calicut (massacred);\n*3. failed to bring the 'Hindu Church' in line (the friars that survived reported the Hindus weren't Christians after all, just 'idolaters');\n*4. failed to make a treaty with Kilwa;\n*5. failed to establish a factory at Sofala (seen from afar by Tovar, but that is all).\n\nOn the other hand, in his defense, Cabral could point to some positive achievements.\n\n*1. opening of friendly relations with Cochin, Canannore and Quilon;\n*2. a factory in Cochin, poorer than Calicut perhaps, but workable;\n*3. discovery of true Christian communities in Cranganore, etc.;\n*4. Sofala was at least discovered and scouted;\n*5. discovery of Brazil, which might serve as a useful staging post for future India runs;\n*6. Diogo Dias's discovery of Madagascar and exploration of the African coast up to Cape Guardafui and the Gulf of Aden was useful information.\n*7. Finally, Cabral did bring back tons of spices, which were off-loaded into the Lisbon warehouses and sold at no small profit for the crown treasury.\n\nHowever, it was the ship and human losses that weighed heavily against Cabral being honored or rewarded. Allegations of 'incompetence' flew easily in the circles that mattered. Although Cabral was initially offered the command of the [[4th Portuguese India Armada (Gama, 1502)|4th Armada]], scheduled for 1502, it seemed more like a ''pro forma'' gesture than a sincere offer.<ref>Subrahmanyam (1997: p.191)</ref> The crown made it clear that Cabral's command would be limited and supervised \u2013 conditions humiliating enough to force Cabral to withdraw his name.  The 4th Armada would be placed under the command of Vasco da Gama.\n\nAlthough the reaction of Portuguese court opinion in 1501, on Cabral's return, was generally low, it ascended retrospectively.  Cabral's discovery of Brazil, initially received as a minor discovery of little interest, turned out to be much more momentous.  The follow-up Brazilian mapping expeditions of 1501-02 and 1503-04, under the captaincy of [[Gon\u00e7alo Coelho]], carrying the Florentine cosmographer [[Amerigo Vespucci]], revealed a massive continent - which Vespucci famously labelled a \"[[New World]]\" (''Mundus Novus'').  The plentitude of [[brazilwood]] (''pau-brasil'') discovered by the mapping expeditions on its shores lured the interest of European cloth industry, and led to the 1505 contract granted to [[Fern\u00e3o de Loronha]] for the commercial exploitation of Brazil. The lucrative brazilwood trade eventually drew competition from French and Spanish interlopers, forcing the Portuguese government to take a more active interest in Cabral's \"[[Name of Brazil|Land of Vera Cruz]]\", finally leading to the establishment of the first Portuguese colonies in [[Colonial Brazil]] in 1532.\n\n== See also ==\n\n* [[Carta de P\u00earo Vaz de Caminha]]\n* [[Portuguese India Armadas]]\n* [[Portuguese India]]\n* [[Alternative theory of the European discovery of Brazil]]\n\n== Notes ==\n{{Reflist|group=note |30em}}\n\n== References == \n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n== Sources ==\n'''Eyewitness Accounts'''\n\n* [Anonymous Pilot] \"Navigationi del Capitano Pedro Alvares Cabral Scrita per un Piloto Portoghese et Tradotta di Lingua Portoghese in Italiana\", first published in Francanzano Montalbado, 1507, editor, ''Paesi novamente retrovati et Novo Mondo da Alberico Vesputio Florentino intitulato'', Vicenza.

O'Connor, a devout [[Roman Catholic]], often used religious themes in her work and examined the depth of human nature. As O\u2019Connor once revealed in an interview, \"All fiction is about human nature. What kind of human nature you write about depends on the amount and kind of your talent, not on what you may consider correct behavior to be. The best forms of behavior are not more desirable than the worst for fiction, if the writer sees the situation he is creating under the aspect of Truth and follows the necessities of his art.\"<ref name=\"Magee 1\">{{cite book|last=Magee|first=Rosemary M|title=Conversations with Flannery O'Connor|url=https://archive.org/details/conversationswit00ocon|url-access=registration|year=1987|publisher=University Press of Mississippi|location=Jackson}}</ref>\n\nHolding this belief, O\u2019Connor would many times use seemingly shocking methods to get her messages across, as her characters all experience brokenness and pain in various ways. \"Parker\u2019s Back\" provides one of those such characters, who moves from a hedonistic, painless lifestyle to a life of true sacrifice and pain for God.\n\n== Plot summary ==\n\"Parker\u2019s Back\" takes place in [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]] in the early 1960's following the life of protagonist, O. E. Parker, a religiously estranged man.<ref>This sentence is phrased awkwardly.\n\n1. \"Parker's Back\" doesn't take place in Georgia. The setting of \"Parker's Back\" is in Georgia. (This adds clarity to the sentence).\n\n<br /></ref>Later, he developes a tenuous interest in religion, motivated by the lack of shared priorities with his wife. The story starts with Parker and his Biblically-named wife, [[Sarah]] [[Book of Ruth|Ruth]], on the front porch of their country house. Sarah Ruth is \"snapping beans\" on the front porch and Parker, lost in thought, occasionally makes sharp comments to her. The reader is given insight into the attitude and thoughts of Parker. Parker does not think highly of Sarah Ruth and questions why he continues to stay with her. Parker scorns Sarah Ruth\u2019s [[fundamentalist Christian]] attitudes, for she disapproves of his smoking, drinking, and tattoos.\n\nThe [[protagonist]] begins to contemplate his relationship with Sarah Ruth and how his life has developed. As a young boy, Parker is described as being less-than-ordinary and quite earnest. One day, he saw a man at a fair who was layered with tattoos. For the first time in his life, Parker felt the wonder and awe he desired; he recognized a greater sense of purpose. Parker then proceeded to get his first tattoo, and decides that they are worth it so he began working to pay for more. He fell into a bad crowd and began to drink, smoke, and sleep around. His mother was upset by his lifestyle, and she tried to interfere religiously to make him change his ways. Finally reaching her limit, his mother dragged him to a revival, and upon arrival at the church, Parker runs away.\n\nParker then lies about his age and joins the Navy. As he comes into the ports during his Naval service, Parker begins to acquire more tattoos. He obtains an eagle, along with several other animals, royalty, and even some obscenities in places that are not visible. Parker departs from the Navy without official leave, but they chase him down, imprison him for nine months, and give him a dishonorable discharge. Afterwards, Parker settles down in the country and begins to pick up odd jobs, only keeping them for as long as he feels like working.\n\nOne day, as Parker is selling apples in the countryside, his truck breaks down. He senses that someone is watching him; he loudly curses and pretends to hurt himself. The next thing he knows, a young woman is hitting him with a broom. Parker meets this woman, who happens to be his future wife, Sarah Ruth. He returns over the next few days finding himself attracted to Sarah, yet he does not know why. Despite her constant back-and-forth attitude, Parker continues to pursue Sarah Ruth, going as far as to tell her his full name so that he could learn hers. Ultimately, in order to bed Sarah Ruth, Parker marries her. However, this improved nothing in their relationship. Sarah Ruth was constantly judging Parker for having too many tattoos, and Parker was constantly deciding that he would not return home to her, but he always found himself returning.\n\nWhen Parker finishes contemplating his relationship with Sarah Ruth, he thinks about getting a new tattoo. The only bare area for a tattoo was on his back. Even though Parker did not wish to get a tattoo any place he could not see it, he desires to obtain one in order to win Sarah Ruth over, and to cease her constant nagging. While at work, Parker rides a tractor in a field, however, he is so busy contemplating what tattoo to get that he pays no attention to where he is going and crashes into a tree his boss explicitly told him to not hit. The tractor is destroyed. In the resulting fire that destroys both machine and tree, Parker's tension comes to a head and he runs to his truck, driving the 50 miles it takes to get into the city. He runs into the tattoo salon and demands to see the book of tattoos pertaining to God, feeling that when he found the right one there would be a sign. As he flips through the book of tattoos, one particular image of Christ catches Parker's attention so much so that he turns back to it after flipping past it.\n\nGoing against the tattoo artist's suggestion for the image, Parker asks to have the tattoo of the [[Byzantine]] Christ put on his back, exactly as it is done in the book. While reluctant at first, the tattoo artist begins the procedure of putting this tattoo on Parker\u2019s back. That night, Parker sleeps in the city's homeless shelter and returns to the tattoo shop the next morning to have the image finished. The tattoo artist mocks Parker about the possibility of being \"saved\", and Parker explains that he is getting the tattoo in order to make his wife back off about how he is a sinner. After the tattoo is finished, Parker originally refuses to look at it; however, the tattoo artist ultimately forces him to look at it. Parker is unhappy with the way the tattoo looks. While the artist reminds him that it was Parker's choice and that he would have recommended something different, Parker goes to a pool hall he has frequently visited in the past. After the men figure out that Parker has a new tattoo, they lift up his shirt to look at it. After seeing it, they begin to mock Parker for his \"new-found faith\". Parker is thrown out of the bar for starting a fight, and after laying in the dirt for some time afterwards, drives back to his house out in the country.\n\nOnce he reaches his house, Parker knocks on the door and begs for Sarah Ruth to let him in. At first, Sarah Ruth refuses, but she opens the door after Parker refers to himself by his full given name, [[Obadiah]] [[Elihu (Job)|Elihue]]. Once inside, Parker shows Sarah Ruth his tattoo, hoping for a positive reaction\u2014that she will be glad to hear that he has supposedly accepted Christ. However, Sarah Ruth flies into a fury, claiming that God doesn't \"look\" like anything because he has no corporeal form. She then begins screaming that Parker is committing idolatry, and that she will not tolerate that in her house. Sarah Ruth begins beating Parker's back with a broom, until he is bruised and left with welts on his back. She then proceeds to shake the broom out of the window to \"get the taint of him off it\". The story ends with Parker crying up against the tree in the front yard as Sarah Ruth watches dispassionately.\n\n== Byzantine Christ ==\nWhen Parker sought a tattoo for his back, he knew that he wanted to procure a tattoo of Christ. As he flipped through the book of tattoo designs, the tattoo of Christ with piercing eyes stopped him. As Parker continued to look at the picture, the eyes of Christ looked into him, and Parker felt compelled to choose that tattoo. The tattoo that Parker obtained was one of the Byzantine Christ, the [[Pantocrator]]. The Pantocrator was glorified by the Byzantine Empire through its literal definition as \"all-powerful or Almighty Christ\". This image is a popular [[icon]] among the Eastern Catholic and Orthodox Churches.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Homik|first=Heidi|last2=Parsons|first2=Mikeal|year=2015|title=Christ Pantocrator, Alpha and Omega, surrounded by angels, the elect, and Mary, Mother of God, Dome of Paradise, by Giusto de' Menabuoi (1320-1391)|url=http://www.christiancentury.org/archives/Vol132-Issue23|journal=Christian Century|volume=132|pages=47|via=}}</ref> The Christ Pantocrator is a wooden panel that dates back to the 6th century and from St. Catherine's monastery from Egypt.

When he looks at the image of Christ, he looks through the \u201cwindow\u201d of the iconic image and sees the depth of God\u2019s love, as he gives his life to Christ. Parker sees that his previous, hedonistic views in life are false, and that suffering\u2014at the hands of Sarah Ruth\u2014for Christ is the way to fulfillment.\n\n\"But Parker\u2019s back is now Christ\u2019s face and the welts, rising redly on one, also disfigure the other. The bond between the two is irrevocable and Parker\u2019s only comfort now is the supreme comfort\u2014that he has a tree, a cross, to lean on, that in his suffering he experiences only what Christ himself felt.

She believes that Christ is a \"spirit\", and that \"he has no face\". Sarah Ruth follows the God of the Hebrew people, who have established that God cannot be seen, which differs from other branches of faith.<ref>{{Cite journal|title=Writing on the Flesh: Tattoos and Taboos in \"Parker's Back\"|journal = The Southern Literary Journal|volume = 14|issue = 2|pages = 8\u201318|last=Bleikasten|first=Andr\u00e9|date=1982|jstor = 20077673}}</ref>\n\n== Literary technique ==\nO'Connor uses a variety of literary techniques. In her stories, she is willing to use unconventional means to provide an original look at reality. As she revealed in a correspondence about notable American novelist and literary critic [[Caroline Gordon]], \"no Caroline didn\u2019t mean the tattoos in Parker\u2019s Back were the heresy. Sarah Ruth was the heretic\u2014the notion that you can worship in pure spirit. Caroline gave me a lot of advice about the story but most of it I\u2019m ignoring. She thinks every story must be built according to the pattern of the Roman arch and she would enlarge the beginning and the end, but I\u2019m letting it lay. I did well to write it at all.\"<ref>{{cite book|last=O'Connor|first=Flannery|title=The Habit of Being|year=1979|publisher=The Noonday Press|location=New York}}</ref>\n\nThis story is narrated in [[Third-person narrative|Third-person]] through the viewpoint of Parker. A strictly objective third person narration would not be conducive to having an intimate tie with Parker. By looking through the lens of Parker's experience, the reader is able to empathize with Parker; the reader can see the extent to which Parker is struggling. The viewpoint of this story helps to create a very strong protagonist in Parker.\n\nThe story also uses [[irony]] as an effective element. In \"Parker's Back,\" O'Connor presents one ironic situation after another. The situational irony is effective at catching the reader by surprise, so that the story is more riveting. Irony is an element that O'Connor uses commonly in her stories. For example, Parker's marriage to Sarah Ruth is ironic. Parker, with his hedonistic lifestyle of drinking, cursing, tattoos, and apathy toward religion was the antithesis of Sarah Ruth. And yet Sarah Ruth marries Parker, and their marriage\u2014though rocky\u2014does not end in divorce within the story.\n\nO'Connor continues this irony with Parker beginning a relationship with God through his experience of gaining a tattoo. The reader may expect\u2014with the negativity surrounding Parker's tattoos\u2014that he would not find God through them. And yet, ironically, Parker's encountering the tattoo image of Christ proves to be a profound experience.  There is also irony also at the end of the story when Parker returns home to display his tattoo for Sarah Ruth. He expects her to approve of his new-found relationship with Christ, but she denounces his tattoo and throws him out of the house.\n\nThe story uses [[symbols]] to tell Parker's life story. The tattoos he receives are a summary of his life. O'Connor suggests that they are major symbols of his most important things in life, however, they are all linked to something he did wrong in the past. Parker has tattoos all over his body, except for his back. The tattoo that fills his back shows that Parker had a troubled life before he was able to finally find peace.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Cormack |first1=Robin |title=Christ Pantocrator |url=http://projects.leadr.msu.edu/medievalart/exhibits/show/iconography_of_christ/christ_pantocrator |website=Medieval Art}}</ref>\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist}}\n\n{{Works by Flannery O'Connor}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Parker's Back}}\n[[Category:Short stories by Flannery O'Connor]]\n[[Category:1964 short stories]]\n", "text_old": "{{essay-like|date=November 2017}}\n{{Infobox short story | <!-- See [[Wikipedia:WikiProject Novels]] or [[Wikipedia:WikiProject Books]] -->\n| name          = Parker's Back\n| title_orig    =\n| translator    =\n| author        = [[Flannery O'Connor]]\n| country       = [[United States]]\n| language      = [[English language|English]]\n| series        =\n| genre         = [[Southern Gothic]]\n| published_in  = ''[[Everything That Rises Must Converge]]''\n| publication_type = single author anthology\n| publisher     =\n| media_type    =\n| pub_date      = 1965\n| english_pub_date =\n| preceded_by   =\n| followed_by   =\n}}\n\n\"'''Parker's Back'''\" is a short story by American author [[Flannery O'Connor]]. \"Parker\u2019s Back\" was published in 1965 in her final short story collection, ''Everything That Rises Must Converge''.

In her stories, she is willing to use unconventional means to provide an original look at reality. As she revealed in a correspondence about notable American novelist and literary critic [[Caroline Gordon]], \"no Caroline didn\u2019t mean the tattoos in Parker\u2019s Back were the heresy. Sarah Ruth was the heretic\u2014the notion that you can worship in pure spirit. Caroline gave me a lot of advice about the story but most of it I\u2019m ignoring. She thinks every story must be built according to the pattern of the Roman arch and she would enlarge the beginning and the end, but I\u2019m letting it lay. I did well to write it at all.\"<ref>{{cite book|last=O'Connor|first=Flannery|title=The Habit of Being|year=1979|publisher=The Noonday Press|location=New York}}</ref>\n\nThis story is narrated in [[Third-person narrative|Third-person]] through the viewpoint of Parker. A strictly objective third person narration would not be conducive to having an intimate tie with Parker. By looking through the lens of Parker's experience, the reader is able to empathize with Parker; the reader can see the extent to which Parker is struggling. The viewpoint of this story helps to create a very strong protagonist in Parker.\n\nThe story also uses [[irony]] as an effective element. In \"Parker's Back,\" O'Connor presents one ironic situation after another. The situational irony is effective at catching the reader by surprise, so that the story is more riveting. Irony is an element that O'Connor uses commonly in her stories. For example, Parker's marriage to Sarah Ruth is ironic. Parker, with his hedonistic lifestyle of drinking, cursing, tattoos, and apathy toward religion was the antithesis of Sarah Ruth. And yet Sarah Ruth marries Parker, and their marriage\u2014though rocky\u2014does not end in divorce within the story.\n\nO'Connor continues this irony with Parker beginning a relationship with God through his experience of gaining a tattoo. The reader may expect\u2014with the negativity surrounding Parker's tattoos\u2014that he would not find God through them. And yet, ironically, Parker's encountering the tattoo image of Christ proves to be a profound experience.  There is also irony also at the end of the story when Parker returns home to display his tattoo for Sarah Ruth. He expects her to approve of his new-found relationship with Christ, but she denounces his tattoo and throws him out of the house.\n\nThe story uses [[symbols]] to tell Parker's life story. The tattoos he receives are a summary of his life. O'Connor suggests that they are major symbols of his most important things in life, however, they are all linked to something he did wrong in the past. Parker has tattoos all over his body, except for his back. The tattoo that fills his back is shows that Parker had a troubled life before he was able to finally find peace.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Cormack |first1=Robin |title=Christ Pantocrator |url=http://projects.leadr.msu.edu/medievalart/exhibits/show/iconography_of_christ/christ_pantocrator |website=Medieval Art}}</ref>\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist}}\n\n{{Works by Flannery O'Connor}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Parker's Back}}\n[[Category:Short stories by Flannery O'Connor]]\n[[Category:1964 short stories]]\n", "name_user": "Beilbacher", "label": "safe", "comment": "\"The tattoo that fills his back is shows that Parker had a troubled life before he was able to finally find peace.\" The is that follows the word back should not be in the sentence.", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parker%27s_Back"}

In salami publishing, data gathered by one research project is separately reported (wholly or in part) in multiple end publications.  Salami publishing, apparently named by analogy with the thin slices made from a larger [[salami]] sausage, is generally considered questionable when not explicitly labeled, as it may lead to the same data being counted multiple times as apparently independent results in aggregate studies.<ref>[http://ori.hhs.gov/avoiding-plagiarism-self-plagiarism-and-other-questionable-writing-practices-guide-ethical-writing Avoiding plagiarism, self-plagiarism, and other questionable writing practices: A guide to ethical writing<!-- Bot generated title -->].</ref><ref>Abraham P., [http://www.jpgmonline.com/article.asp?issn=0022-3859;year=2000;volume=46;issue=2;spage=67;epage=9;aulast=Abraham Duplicate and salami publications].

Scientists typically use a 5% threshold (0.95 probability) to determine whether a hypothesis is supported by the results of a research project. If multiple hypotheses are being tested on a single research project, 1 in 20 hypotheses will by chance be supported by the research. Partially reported research projects must use a more stringent threshold when testing for statistical significance but often do not do this.<ref>[http://www.economist.com/science/displaystory.cfm?story_id=8733754 \"Signs of the times\"], ''The Economist'', February 24th 2007.

The number of publications is often [[publish or perish|used to assess the work of a scientist]] and as a basis for distributing research funds. In order to achieve a high rank in such an assessment, there is a trend to split up research results into smaller parts that are published separately, thus inflating the number of publications. This process has been described as splitting the results into the smallest publishable units.<ref name=Broad1981>{{citation|date=13 March 1981|author=Broad, William J|authorlink=William Broad|title=The Publishing Game: Getting More for Less|pages=1137\u20131139|journal=Science|volume=211|doi=10.1126/science.7008199|pmid=7008199}}</ref><ref name=Broad&Wade1983>{{citation|year=1983|author1=Broad, William|author2=Wade, Nicholas|authorlink=Nicholas Wade|title=[[Betrayers of the Truth: Fraud and Deceit in the Halls of Science]]|pages=53\u201355|place=London|publisher=Century Publishing|isbn=0-7126-0243-7}}</ref> \n\n\"'''Salami publication'''\", sometimes also referred to as '''\"[[salami slicing]]\"''', is a variant of the smallest-publishable-unit strategy.  In salami publishing, data gathered by one research project is separately reported (wholly or in part) in multiple end publications.  Salami publishing, apparently named by analogy with the thin slices made from a larger [[salami]] sausage, is generally considered questionable when not explicitly labeled, as it may lead to the same data being counted multiple times as apparently independent results in aggregate studies.<ref>[http://ori.hhs.gov/avoiding-plagiarism-self-plagiarism-and-other-questionable-writing-practices-guide-ethical-writing Avoiding plagiarism, self-plagiarism, and other questionable writing practices: A guide to ethical writing<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref><ref>[http://www.jpgmonline.com/article.asp?issn=0022-3859;year=2000;volume=46;issue=2;spage=67;epage=9;aulast=Abraham Duplicate and salami publications.

Scientists typically use a 5% threshold (0.95 probability) to determine whether a hypothesis is supported by the results of a research project. If multiple hypotheses are being tested on a single research project, 1 in 20 hypotheses will by chance be supported by the research. Partially reported research projects must use a more stringent threshold when testing for statistical significance but often do not do this.<ref>[http://www.economist.com/science/displaystory.cfm?story_id=8733754 \"Signs of the times\"], ''The Economist'', February 24th 2007.

He was knighted in 1909.\n\nGalton produced over 340 papers and books. He also created the statistical concept of [[correlation]] and widely promoted [[regression toward the mean]]. He was the first to apply statistical methods to the study of human differences and [[inheritance of intelligence]], and introduced the use of [[questionnaires]] and [[Statistical survey|survey]]s for collecting data on human communities, which he needed for genealogical and biographical works and for his [[anthropometrics|anthropometric]] studies. He was a pioneer of [[eugenics]], coining the term itself in 1883, and also coined the phrase \"[[nature versus nurture]]\".{{sfn|Galton|1874|pp= 227\u2013236}} His book ''[[Hereditary Genius]]'' (1869) was the first social scientific attempt to study [[genius]] and [[greatness]].{{sfn|Galton|1869|p=}}\n\nAs an investigator of the human mind, he founded [[psychometrics]] (the science of measuring mental faculties) and [[differential psychology]], as well as the [[lexical hypothesis]] of personality.

He was [[Charles Darwin]]'s half-cousin, sharing the common grandparent [[Erasmus Darwin]]. His father was [[Samuel Tertius Galton]], son of [[Samuel \"John\" Galton]]. The Galtons were [[Quaker]] gun-manufacturers and bankers, while the Darwins were involved in medicine and science.\n\nHe was cousin of [[Douglas Strutt Galton]] and half-cousin of [[Charles Darwin]]. Both families had Fellows of the [[Royal Society]] and members who loved to invent in their spare time. Both Erasmus Darwin and Samuel Galton were founding members of the [[Lunar Society]] of Birmingham, which included [[Matthew Boulton|Boulton]], [[James Watt|Watt]], [[Josiah Wedgwood|Wedgwood]], [[Joseph Priestley|Priestley]], [[Richard Lovell Edgeworth|Edgeworth]]. Both families were known for their literary talent. Erasmus Darwin composed lengthy technical treatises in verse. Galton's aunt [[Mary Anne Galton]] wrote on aesthetics and religion, and her autobiography detailed the environment of her childhood populated by Lunar Society members.\n\n[[File:Sir Francis Galton by Octavius Oakley.jpg|thumb|upright|Portrait of Galton by [[Octavius Oakley]], 1840]]\n\nGalton was a [[child prodigy]]&nbsp;\u2013 he was reading by the age of two; at age five he knew some [[Ancient Greek|Greek]], [[Latin]] and long division, and by the age of six he had moved on to adult books, including [[Shakespeare]] for pleasure, and poetry, which he quoted at length.{{sfn|Bulmer|2003|p=4}} Galton attended [[King Edward's School, Birmingham]], but chafed at the narrow classical curriculum and left at 16.{{sfn|Cowan|2005}} His parents pressed him to enter the medical profession, and he studied for two years at [[Birmingham General Hospital]] and [[King's College London]] [[Medical School]]. He followed this up with mathematical studies at [[Trinity College, Cambridge|Trinity College]], [[University of Cambridge]], from 1840 to early 1844.<ref name=\"ACAD\" />\n\nAccording to the records of the [[United Grand Lodge of England]], it was in February 1844 that Galton became a [[freemason]] at the ''Scientific'' lodge, held at the Red Lion Inn in Cambridge, progressing through the three masonic degrees: Apprentice, 5 February 1844; Fellow Craft, 11 March 1844; Master Mason, 13 May 1844. A note in the record states: \"Francis Galton Trinity College student, gained his certificate 13 March 1845\".<ref name=\"Freemasonry\" /> One of Galton's masonic certificates from ''Scientific'' lodge can be found among his papers at [[University College, London]].<ref name=\"MerringtonGolden1976\" />\n\nA [[nervous breakdown]] prevented Galton's intent to try for honours. He elected instead to take a \"poll\" (pass) B.A. degree, like his half-cousin Charles Darwin.{{sfn|Bulmer|2003|p=5}} (Following the Cambridge custom, he was awarded an M.A. without further study, in 1847.) He briefly resumed his medical studies but the death of his father in 1844 left him emotionally destitute, though financially independent,{{Citation needed|date=May 2017}} and he terminated his medical studies entirely, turning to foreign travel, sport and technical invention.\n\nIn his early years Galton was an enthusiastic traveller, and made a notable solo trip through Eastern Europe to [[Constantinople]], before going up to Cambridge. In 1845 and 1846, he went to [[Egypt]] and travelled up the [[Nile]] to [[Khartoum]] in the [[Sudan]], and from there to [[Beirut]], [[Damascus]] and down the [[Jordan]].\n\nIn 1850 he joined the [[Royal Geographical Society]], and over the next two years mounted a long and difficult [[exploration|expedition]] into then little-known [[South West Africa]] (now [[Namibia]]). He wrote a book on his experience, \"Narrative of an Explorer in Tropical South Africa\".{{sfn|Galton|1853}} He was awarded the Royal Geographical Society's [[Gold Medal (RGS)|Founder's Gold Medal]] in 1853 and the Silver Medal of the French Geographical Society for his pioneering cartographic survey of the region.{{sfn|Bulmer|2003|p=16}} This established his reputation as a geographer and explorer. He proceeded to write the best-selling ''The Art of Travel'', a handbook of practical advice for the [[Victorian era|Victorian]] on the move, which went through many editions and is still in print.\n\n==Middle years==\n[[File:Francis_Galton_1850s.jpg|thumb|Galton in the 1850s]]\nGalton was a [[polymath]] who made important contributions in many fields of science, including [[meteorology]] (the [[anti-cyclone]] and the first popular weather maps), statistics (regression and correlation), [[psychology]] ([[synaesthesia]]), [[biology]] (the nature and mechanism of heredity), and [[criminology]] (fingerprints). Much of this was influenced by his [[penchant]] for counting and measuring. Galton prepared the first [[weather map]] published in ''[[The Times]]'' (1 April 1875, showing the weather from the previous day, 31 March), now a standard feature in newspapers worldwide.<ref name=\"meteor\" />\n\nHe became very active in the [[British Association for the Advancement of Science]], presenting many papers on a wide variety of topics at its meetings from 1858 to 1899.{{sfn|Bulmer|2003|p=29}} He was the general secretary from 1863 to 1867, president of the Geographical section in 1867 and 1872, and president of the Anthropological Section in 1877 and 1885. He was active on the council of the Royal Geographical Society for over forty years, in various committees of the Royal Society, and on the Meteorological Council.\n\n[[James McKeen Cattell]], a student of [[Wilhelm Wundt]] who had been reading Galton's articles, decided he wanted to study under him. He eventually built a professional relationship with Galton, measuring subjects and working together on research.{{sfn|Gillham|2001a|p=}}\n\nIn 1888, Galton established a lab in the science galleries of the South Kensington Museum. In Galton's lab, participants could be measured to gain knowledge of their strengths and weaknesses. Galton also used these data for his own research. He would typically charge people a small fee for his services.{{sfn|Hergenhahn|Henley|2013|p=288}}\n\nIn 1873, Galton wrote a controversial letter to ''[[The Times]]'' titled 'Africa for the Chinese', where he argued that the Chinese, as a race capable of high civilisation and only temporarily stunted by the recent failures of Chinese dynasties, should be encouraged to immigrate to Africa and displace the supposedly inferior aboriginal blacks.<ref name=\"TheTimes1873\" />\n\n==Heredity and eugenics==\n{{more citations needed|section|date=January 2018}}<!--first 4 paragraphs have no citations-->\n[[File:Francis Galton2.jpg|thumb|Galton in his later years]]\nThe publication by his cousin Charles Darwin of ''[[The Origin of Species]]'' in 1859 was an event that changed Galton's life.{{sfn|Forrest|1974|page=84}} He came to be gripped by the work, especially the first chapter on \"Variation under Domestication\", concerning [[animal breeding]].\n\nGalton devoted much of the rest of his life to exploring variation in human populations and its implications, at which Darwin had only hinted. In doing so, he established a research program which embraced multiple aspects of human variation, from mental characteristics to height; from facial images to fingerprint patterns. This required inventing novel measures of traits, devising large-scale collection of data using those measures, and in the end, the discovery of new statistical techniques for describing and understanding the data.\n\nGalton was interested at first in the question of whether human ability was [[hereditary]], and proposed to count the number of the relatives of various degrees of eminent men. If the qualities were hereditary, he reasoned, there should be more eminent men among the relatives than among the general population. To test this, he invented the methods of [[historiometry]]. Galton obtained extensive data from a broad range of biographical sources which he tabulated and compared in various ways. This pioneering work was described in detail in his book ''Hereditary Genius'' in 1869.{{sfn|Galton|1869|p=}} Here he showed, among other things, that the numbers of eminent relatives dropped off when going from the first degree to the second degree relatives, and from the second degree to the third. He took this as evidence of the [[inheritance of intelligence|inheritance of abilities]].\n\nGalton recognised the limitations of his methods in these two works, and believed the question could be better studied by comparisons of twins. His method envisaged testing to see if twins who were similar at birth diverged in dissimilar environments, and whether twins dissimilar at birth converged when reared in similar environments. He again used the method of questionnaires to gather various sorts of data, which were tabulated and described in a paper ''The history of twins'' in 1875. In so doing he anticipated the modern field of [[behaviour genetics]], which relies heavily on [[twin studies]]. He concluded that the evidence favoured nature rather than nurture. He also proposed [[adoption study|adoption studies]], including trans-racial adoption studies, to separate the effects of heredity and environment.\n\nGalton recognised that cultural circumstances influenced the capability of a civilisation's citizens, and their [[reproductive success]]. In ''Hereditary Genius'', he envisaged a situation conducive to resilient and enduring civilisation as follows:\n\n{{quote|\nThe best form of civilization in respect to the improvement of the race, would be one in which society was not costly; where incomes were chiefly derived from professional sources, and not much through inheritance; where every lad had a chance of showing his abilities, and, if highly gifted, was enabled to achieve a first-class education and entrance into professional life, by the liberal help of the exhibitions and scholarships which he had gained in his early youth; where marriage was held in as high honour as in ancient Jewish times; where the pride of race was encouraged (of course I do not refer to the nonsensical sentiment of the present day, that goes under that name); where the weak could find a welcome and a refuge in celibate monasteries or sisterhoods, and lastly, where the better sort of emigrants and refugees from other lands were invited and welcomed, and their descendants naturalised.\n|source={{harvnb|Galton|1869|p=362}} }}\n\nGalton invented the term ''[[eugenics]]'' in 1883 and set down many of his observations and conclusions in a book, ''[[Inquiries into Human Faculty and Its Development]]''. In the book's introduction, he wrote: {{quote|[This book's] intention is to touch on various topics more or less connected with that of the cultivation of race, or, as we might call it, with \"eugenic\"<sup>1</sup> questions, and to present the results of several of my own separate investigations.<br /><sup>1</sup> This is, with questions bearing on what is termed in Greek, ''eugenes'', namely, good in stock, hereditarily endowed with noble qualities. This, and the allied words, ''eugeneia'', etc., are equally applicable to men, brutes, and plants. We greatly want a brief word to express the science of improving stock, which is by no means confined to questions of judicious mating, but which, especially in the case of man, takes cognisance of all influences that tend in however remote a degree to give the more suitable races or strains of blood a better chance of prevailing speedily over the less suitable than they otherwise would have had. The word ''eugenics'' would sufficiently express the idea; it is at least a neater word and a more generalised one than ''viriculture'', which I once ventured to use.|source={{harvnb|Galton|1883|pp=24\u201325}} }}\n\nHe believed that a scheme of 'marks' for family merit should be defined, and early marriage between families of high rank be encouraged via provision of monetary incentives. He pointed out some of the tendencies in British society, such as the late marriages of eminent people, and the paucity of their children, which he thought were ''[[dysgenics|dysgenic]]''. He advocated encouraging eugenic marriages by supplying able couples with incentives to have children. On 29 October 1901, Galton chose to address eugenic issues when he delivered the second Huxley lecture at the Royal Anthropological Institute.{{sfn|Gillham|2001a|p=}}\n\n''[[The Eugenics Review]]'', the journal of the Eugenics Education Society, commenced publication in 1909. Galton, the Honorary President of the society, wrote the foreword for the first volume.{{sfn|Gillham|2001a|p=}} The First International Congress of Eugenics was held in July 1912. [[Winston Churchill]] and Carls Elliot were among the attendees.{{sfn|Gillham|2001a|p=}}\n\n== Model for population stability ==\n[[File:Sir Francis Galton, 1890s.jpg|thumb|left|Sir Francis Galton, 1890s]]\nGalton's formulation of regression and its link to the bivariate normal distribution can be traced to his attempts at developing a mathematical model for population stability. Although Galton's first attempt to study Darwinian questions,  ''Hereditary Genius'', generated little enthusiasm at the time, the text led to his further studies in the 1870s concerning the inheritance of physical traits.{{sfn|Stigler|2010|pp=469\u2013482}} This text contains some crude notions of the concept of regression, described in a qualitative matter. For example, he wrote of dogs: \"If a man breeds from strong, well-shaped dogs, but of mixed pedigree, the puppies will be sometimes, but rarely, the equals of their parents. they will commonly be of a mongrel, nondescript type, because ancestral peculiarities are apt to crop out in the offspring.\"{{sfn|Galton|1914|p=57}}\n\nThis notion created a problem for Galton, as he could not reconcile the tendency of a population to maintain a normal distribution of traits from generation to generation with the notion of inheritance. It seemed that a large number of factors operated independently on offspring,  leading to the normal distribution of a trait in each generation. However, this provided no explanation as to how a parent can have a significant impact on his offspring, which was the basis of inheritance.{{sfn|Stigler|1986|pp=265\u2013299}}\n\nGalton's solution to this problem was presented in his Presidential Address at the September 1885 meeting of the [[British Association for the Advancement of Science]], as he was serving at the time as President of Section H: Anthropology.<ref name=\":3\">{{Cite journal|last=Galton|first=Francis|year=1885|title=Opening address as President of the Anthropology Section of the British Association for the Advancement of Science, September 10th, 1885, at Aberdeen|journal=Nature|volume=32|pages=507\u2013510}}</ref> The address was published in ''[[Nature (journal)|Nature]],'' and Galton further developed the theory in  \"Regression toward mediocrity in hereditary stature\" and \"Hereditary Stature.\"{{sfn|Galton|1886|pp=246\u2013263}}{{sfn|Galton|1886b|pp=295\u2013298}} An elaboration of this theory was published in 1889 in ''Natural Inheritance.'' There were three key developments that helped Galton develop this theory: the  development of the law of error in 1874&ndash;1875, the formulation of an empirical law of reversion in 1877, and the development of a mathematical framework encompassing regression using human population data during 1885.{{sfn|Stigler|1986|pp=265\u2013299}}\n\nGalton's development of the law of regression to the mean, or reversion, was due to insights from the [[Bean machine|quincunx]] ('bean machine') and his studies of sweet peas. While Galton had previously invented the quincunx prior to February 1874, the 1877 version of the quincunx had a new feature that helped Galton demonstrate that a normal mixture of normal distributions is also normal.{{sfn|Galton|1877|pp=492\u2013495, 512\u2013514, 532\u2013533}} Galton demonstrated this using a new version of quincunx, adding chutes to the apparatus to represent reversion. When the pellets passed through the curved chutes (representing reversion) and then the pins (representing family variability), the result was a stable population. On Friday 19 February 1877 Galton gave a lecture entitled ''Typical Laws of Heredity'' at the [[Royal Institution]] in London.{{sfn|Galton|1877|pp=492\u2013495, 512\u2013514, 532\u2013533}} In this lecture, he posed that there must a counteracting force to maintain population stability. However, this model required a much larger degree of intergenerational natural selection than was plausible.{{sfn|Stigler|2010|pp=469\u2013482}}\n\nIn 1875, Galton started growing sweet peas, and addressed the Royal Institution on his findings on 9 February 1877.{{sfn|Galton|1877|pp=492\u2013495, 512\u2013514, 532\u2013533}} He found that each group of progeny seeds followed a normal curve, and the curves were equally disperse. Each group was not centered about the parent's weight, but rather at a weight closer to the population average. Galton called this reversion, as every progeny group was distributed at a value that was closer to the population average than the parent. The deviation from the population average was in the same direction, but the magnitude of the deviation was only one-third as large. In doing so, Galton demonstrated that there was variability among each of the families, yet the families combined to produce a stable, normally distributed population. When Galton addressed the British Association for the Advancement of Science in 1885, he said of his investigation of sweet peas, \"I was then blind to what I now perceive to be the simple explanation of the phenomenon.\"<ref name=\":3\" />\n\nGalton was able to further his notion of regression by collecting and analyzing data on human stature. Galton asked for help of mathematician J. Hamilton Dickson in investigating the geometric relationship of the data. He determined that the regression coefficient did not ensure population stability by chance, but rather that the regression coefficient, conditional variance, and population were interdependent quantities related by a simple equation.{{sfn|Stigler|1986|pp=265\u2013299}} Thus Galton identified that the linearity of regression was not coincidental but rather was a necessary consequence of population stability.\n\nThe model for population stability resulted in Galton's formulation of the Law of Ancestral Heredity.  This law, which was published in ''Natural Inheritance,'' states that the two parents of an offspring jointly contribute one half of an offspring's heritage, while the other, more-removed ancestors constitute a  smaller proportion of the offspring's heritage.{{sfn|Bulmer|1998|pp=579\u2013585}} Galton viewed reversion as a spring, that when stretched, would return the distribution of traits back to the normal distribution. He concluded that evolution would have to occur via discontinuous steps, as reversion would neutralize any incremental steps.{{sfn|Gillham|2001b|pp=1383\u20131392}} When [[Mendelian inheritance|Mendel's]] principles were rediscovered in 1900, this resulted in a fierce battle between the followers of Galton's Law of Ancestral Heredity, the biometricians, and those who advocated Mendel's principles.{{sfn|Gillham|2013|pp=61\u201375}}\n\n==Empirical test of pangenesis and Lamarckism==\nGalton conducted wide-ranging inquiries into heredity which led him to challenge Charles Darwin's hypothesis of [[pangenesis]]. Darwin had proposed as part of this model that certain particles, which he called \"[[gemmules]]\" moved throughout the body and were also responsible for the inheritance of acquired characteristics. Galton, in consultation with Darwin, set out to see if they were transported in the blood. In a long series of experiments in 1869 to 1871, he transfused the blood between dissimilar breeds of rabbits, and examined the features of their offspring.<ref name=\"abc.net.au\" /> He found no evidence of characters transmitted in the transfused blood.{{sfn|Bulmer|2003|pp=116\u2013118}}\n\nDarwin challenged the validity of Galton's experiment, giving his reasons in an article published in ''[[Nature (journal)|Nature]]'' where he wrote:\n\n{{quote|\nNow, in the chapter on Pangenesis in my ''[[Variation of Animals and Plants under Domestication]]'' I have not said one word about the blood, or about any fluid proper to any circulating system. It is, indeed, obvious that the presence of gemmules in the blood can form no necessary part of my hypothesis; for I refer in illustration of it to the lowest animals, such as the Protozoa, which do not possess blood or any vessels; and I refer to plants in which the fluid, when present in the vessels, cannot be considered as true blood. The fundamental laws of growth, reproduction, inheritance, &c., are so closely similar throughout the whole organic kingdom, that the means by which the gemmules (assuming for the moment their existence) are diffused through the body, would probably be the same in all beings; therefore the means can hardly be diffusion through the blood. Nevertheless, when I first heard of Mr. Galton's experiments, I did not sufficiently reflect on the subject, and saw not the difficulty of believing in the presence of gemmules in the blood.\n|source={{harvnb|Darwin|1871|pp=502\u2013503}} }}\n\nGalton explicitly rejected the idea of the [[inheritance of acquired characteristics]] ([[Lamarckism]]), and was an early proponent of \"hard heredity\" {{sfn|Bulmer|2003|pp=105\u2013107}} through selection alone. He came close to rediscovering Mendel's particulate theory of inheritance, but was prevented from making the final breakthrough in this regard because of his focus on continuous, rather than discrete, traits (now known as [[polygenic]] traits). He went on to found the [[Biostatistics|biometric]] approach to the study of heredity, distinguished by its use of statistical techniques to study continuous traits and population-scale aspects of heredity.\n\nThis approach was later taken up enthusiastically by [[Karl Pearson]] and [[Raphael Weldon|W. F. R. Weldon]]; together, they founded the highly influential journal ''[[Biometrika]]'' in 1901.  ([[R. A. Fisher]] would later show how the biometrical approach could be reconciled with the Mendelian approach.{{sfn|Nelson|Pettersson|Carlborg|2013|pp=669\u2013676}}) The statistical techniques that Galton invented (correlation and regression\u2014see below) and phenomena he established (regression to the mean) formed the basis of the biometric approach and are now essential tools in all the social sciences.\n\n== Anthropometric Laboratory at the 1884 International Health Exhibition ==\nIn 1884, London hosted the International Health Exhibition. This exhibition placed much emphasis on highlighting Victorian developments in sanitation and public health, and allowed the nation to display its advanced public health outreach, compared to other countries at the time. Francis Galton took advantage of this opportunity to set up his anthropometric laboratory. He stated that the purpose of this laboratory was to \"show the public the simplicity of the instruments and methods by which the chief physical characteristics of man may be measured and recorded.\"{{sfn|Galton|1885|pp=205-221}} The laboratory was an interactive walk-through in which physical characteristics such as height, weight, and eyesight, would be measured for each subject after payment of an admission fee. Upon entering the laboratory, a subject would visit the following stations in order.\n\nFirst, they would fill out a form with personal and family history (age, birthplace, marital status, residence, and occupation), then visit stations that recorded hair and eye color, followed by the keenness, color-sense, and depth perception of sight. Next, they would examine the keenness, or relative acuteness, of hearing and highest audible note of their hearing followed by an examination of their sense of touch. However, because the surrounding area was noisy, the apparatus intended to measure hearing was rendered ineffective by the noise and echoes in the building. Their breathing capacity would also be measured, as well as their ability to throw a punch. The next stations would examine strength of both pulling and squeezing with both hands. Lastly, subjects' heights in various positions (sitting, standing, etc.) as well as arm span and weight would be measured.{{sfn|Galton|1885|pp=205-221}}\n\nOne excluded characteristic of interest was the size of the head. Galton notes in his analysis that this omission was mostly for practical reasons. For instance, it would not be very accurate and additionally it would require much time for women to disassemble and reassemble their hair and bonnets.{{sfn|Galton|1884|p=}} The patrons would then be given a souvenir containing all their biological data, while Galton would also keep a copy for future statistical research.\n\nAlthough the laboratory did not employ any revolutionary measurement techniques, it was unique because of the simple logistics of constructing such a demonstration within a limited space, and because of the speed and efficiency with which all the necessary data were gathered. The laboratory itself was a see-through (lattice-walled) fenced off gallery measuring 36 feet long by 6 feet long. To collect data efficiently, Galton had to make the process as simple as possible for people to understand. As a result, subjects were taken through the laboratory in pairs so that explanations could be given to two at a time, also in the hope that one of the two would confidently take the initiative to go through all the tests first, encouraging the other. With this design, the total time spent in the exhibit was fourteen minutes for each pair.{{sfn|Galton|1885|pp=205-221}}\n\nGalton states that the measurements of human characteristics are useful for two reasons. First, he states that measuring physical characteristics is useful in order to ensure, on a more domestic level, that children are developing properly. A useful example he gives for the practicality of these domestic measurements is regularly checking a child's eyesight, in order to correct any deficiencies early on. The second use for the data from his anthropometric laboratory is for statistical studies. He comments on the usefulness of the collected data to compare attributes across occupations, residences, races, etc.{{sfn|Galton|1885|pp=205-221}} The exhibit at the health exhibition allowed Galton to collect a large amount of raw data from which to conduct further comparative studies. He had 9,337 respondents, each measured in 17 categories, creating a rather comprehensive statistical database.{{sfn|Galton|1884|p=}}\n\nAfter the conclusion of the International Health Exhibition, Galton used these data to confirm in humans his theory of linear regression, posed after studying sweet peas. The accumulation of this human data allowed him to observe the correlation between forearm length and height, head width and head breadth, and head length and height. With these observations he was able to write ''Co-relations and their Measurements, chiefly from Anthropometric Data''.{{sfn|Gillham|2001c|pp=82-102}} In this publication, Galton defined what co-relation as a phenomenon that occurs when \"the variation of the one [variable] is accompanied on the average by more or less variation of the other, and in the same direction.\"{{sfn|Galton|1888|pp=273-279}}\n\n==Innovations in statistics and psychological theory==\n\n===Historiometry===\nThe method used in ''Hereditary Genius'' has been described as the first example of [[historiometry]]. To bolster these results, and to attempt to make a distinction between 'nature' and 'nurture' (he was the first to apply this phrase to the topic), he devised a questionnaire that he sent out to 190 [[Fellows of the Royal Society]]. He tabulated characteristics of their families, such as [[birth order]] and the occupation and [[Race (classification of human beings)|race]] of their parents. He attempted to discover whether their interest in science was 'innate' or due to the encouragements of others. The studies were published as a book, ''English men of science: their nature and nurture'', in 1874. In the end, it promoted the [[nature versus nurture]] question, though it did not settle it, and provided some fascinating data on the sociology of scientists of the time.{{Citation needed|date=February 2020}}\n\n===The lexical hypothesis===\nSir Francis was the first scientist to recognise what is now known as the [[lexical hypothesis]].{{sfn|Caprara|Cervone|2000|p=68}} This is the idea that the most salient and socially relevant personality differences in people's lives will eventually become encoded into language. The hypothesis further suggests that by sampling language, it is possible to derive a comprehensive taxonomy of human [[personality traits]].\n\n===The questionnaire===\nGalton's inquiries into the mind involved detailed recording of people's subjective accounts of whether and how their minds dealt with phenomena such as [[visual memory|mental imagery]]. To better elicit this information, he pioneered the use of the [[questionnaire]]. In one study, he asked his fellow members of the Royal Society of London to describe mental images that they experienced. In another, he collected in-depth surveys from eminent scientists for a work examining the effects of nature and nurture on the propensity toward scientific thinking.{{sfn|Clauser|2007|pp=440-444}}\n\n===Variance and standard deviation===\nCore to any statistical analysis is the concept that measurements vary: they have both a [[central tendency]], or mean, and a spread around this central value, or [[variance]]. In the late 1860s, Galton conceived of a measure to quantify normal variation: the [[standard deviation]].<ref>{{cite web|author=Chad Denby |url=http://www.sciencetimeline.net/1866.htm |title=Science Timeline |publisher=Science Timeline |accessdate=22 April 2013}}</ref>\n\nGalton was a keen observer. In 1906, visiting a livestock fair, he stumbled upon an intriguing contest. An ox was on display, and the villagers were invited to guess the animal's weight after it was slaughtered and dressed. Nearly 800 participated, and Galton was able to study their individual entries after the event. Galton stated that \"the middlemost estimate expresses the ''vox populi'', every other estimate being condemned as too low or too high by a majority of the voters\",{{sfn|Galton|1907|p=450}} and reported this value (the [[median]], in terminology he himself had introduced, but chose not to use on this occasion) as 1,207 pounds. To his surprise, this was within 0.8% of the weight measured by the judges. Soon afterwards, in response to an enquiry, he reported<ref>\"[http://galton.org/cgi-bin/searchImages/galton/search/essays/pages/galton-1907-ballot-box_1.htm The Ballot Box]\", ''Nature'', 28 March 1907</ref> the mean of the guesses as 1,197 pounds, but did not comment on its improved accuracy.  Recent archival research{{sfn|Wallis|2014|pp=420-424}} has found some slips in transmitting Galton's calculations to the original article in ''Nature'': the median was actually 1,208 pounds, and the dressed weight of the ox 1,197 pounds, so the mean estimate had zero error.  James Surowiecki{{sfn|Surowiecki|2004|p=}} uses this weight-judging competition as his opening example: had he known the true result, his conclusion on the wisdom of the crowd would no doubt have been more strongly expressed.\n\nThe same year, Galton suggested in a letter to the journal ''[[Nature (journal)|Nature]]'' a better method of cutting a round cake by avoiding making radial incisions.{{sfn|Galton|1906|p=173}}\n\n===Experimental derivation of the normal distribution===\n[[File:Quincunx (Galton Box) - Galton 1889 diagram.png|thumb|Galton's 1889 illustration of the quincunx or [[bean machine]].]]\nStudying variation, Galton invented the quincunx, a [[pachinko]]-like device also known as the [[bean machine]], as a tool for demonstrating the [[law of error]] and the [[normal distribution]].{{sfn|Bulmer|2003|p=4}}\n\n===Bivariate normal distribution===\nHe also discovered the properties of the [[bivariate normal distribution]] and its relationship to [[regression analysis]].\n\n===Correlation and regression===\n[[File:Galton's correlation diagram 1875.jpg|thumb|Galton's correlation diagram 1886{{sfn|Galton |1886|p= 248|loc=[https://books.google.com/books?id=JPcRAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA248-IA3#v=onepage Plate X]}}]]\nIn 1846, the French physicist [[Auguste Bravais]] (1811\u20131863) first developed what would become the correlation coefficient.{{sfn|Bravais|1846|pp=255-332}} After examining forearm and height measurements, Galton independently rediscovered the concept of [[correlation]] in 1888{{sfn|Galton|1888|pp=135-145}}{{sfn|Bulmer|2003|pp=191\u2013196}} and demonstrated its application in the study of heredity, anthropology, and psychology.{{sfn|Clauser|2007|pp=440-444}} Galton's later statistical study of the probability of extinction of surnames led to the concept of [[Galton\u2013Watson process|Galton\u2013Watson stochastic processes]].{{sfn|Bulmer|2003|pp=182\u2013184}} This is now a core of modern statistics and regression.\n\nGalton invented the use of the regression line{{sfn|Bulmer|2003|p=184}} and for the choice of r (for reversion or regression) to represent the correlation coefficient.{{sfn|Clauser|2007|pp=440-444}}\n\nIn the 1870s and 1880s he was a pioneer in the use of [[normal distribution|normal theory]] to fit [[histogram]]s and [[Ogive (statistics)|ogives]] to actual tabulated data, much of which he collected himself: for instance [[big data|large samples]] of sibling and parental height. Consideration of the results from these empirical studies led to his further insights into evolution, natural selection, and regression to the mean.\n\n===Regression toward the mean===\nGalton was the first to describe and explain the common phenomenon of [[regression toward the mean]], which he first observed in his experiments on the size of the seeds of successive generations of sweet peas.\n\nThe conditions under which regression toward the mean occurs depend on the way the term is mathematically defined. Galton first observed the phenomenon in the context of [[simple linear regression]] of data points. Galton{{sfn|Galton|1889|p=}} developed the following model: pellets fall through a ''[[quincunx]]'' or \"[[bean machine]]\" forming a normal distribution centered directly under their entrance point. These pellets could then be released down into a second gallery (corresponding to a second measurement occasion). Galton then asked the reverse question \"from where did these pellets come?\"\n{{quote|\nThe answer was not \"on average directly above\". Rather it was \"on average, more towards the middle\", for the simple reason that there were more pellets above it towards the middle that could wander left than there were in the left extreme that could wander to the right, inwards.|\nsource={{harvnb|Stigler|2010|p=477}} }}\n\n===Theories of perception===\nGalton went beyond measurement and summary to attempt to explain the phenomena he observed. Among such developments, he proposed an early theory of ranges of sound and [[hearing (sense)|hearing]], and collected large quantities of anthropometric data from the public through his popular and long-running Anthropometric Laboratory, which he established in 1884, and where he studied over 9,000 people.{{sfn|Gillham|2001a|p=}} It was not until 1985 that these data were analysed in their entirety.\n\n===Differential psychology===\nGalton's study of human abilities ultimately led to the foundation of [[differential psychology]] and the formulation of the first mental tests. He was interested in measuring humans in every way possible. This included measuring their ability to make sensory discrimination which he assumed was linked to intellectual prowess. Galton suggested that individual differences in general ability are reflected in performance on relatively simple sensory capacities and in speed of reaction to a stimulus, variables that could be objectively measured by tests of sensory discrimination and reaction\ntime.{{sfn|Jensen|2002|pp=145-172}} He also measured how quickly people reacted which he later linked to internal wiring which ultimately limited intelligence ability. Throughout his research Galton assumed that people who reacted faster were more intelligent than others.\n\n===Composite photography===\nGalton also devised a technique called \"[[composite portrait]]ure\" (produced by superimposing multiple photographic portraits of individuals' faces registered on their eyes) to create an average face (see [[averageness]]). In the 1990s, a hundred years after his discovery, much psychological research has examined the [[attractiveness]] of these faces, an aspect that Galton had remarked on in his original lecture. Others, including [[Sigmund Freud]] in his work on dreams, picked up Galton's suggestion that these composites might represent a useful metaphor for an [[Ideal type]] or a [[concept]] of a \"[[natural kind]]\" (see [[Eleanor Rosch]])\u2014such as Jewish men, criminals, patients with tuberculosis, etc.\u2014onto the same photographic plate, thereby yielding a blended whole, or \"composite\", that he hoped could generalise the facial appearance of his subject into an \"average\" or \"central type\".{{sfn|Galton|1883|p=}}{{sfn|Galton|1878|pp=132\u2013142}} (See also entry ''Modern physiognomy'' under [[Physiognomy]]).\n\nThis work began in the 1880s while the Jewish scholar [[Joseph Jacobs]] studied anthropology and statistics with Francis Galton. Jacobs asked Galton to create a composite photograph of a Jewish type.{{sfn|Novak|2008|p=100}} One of Jacobs' first publications that used Galton's composite imagery was \"The Jewish Type, and Galton's Composite Photographs,\" ''Photographic News'', 29, (24 April 1885): 268\u2013269.\n\nGalton hoped his technique would aid medical diagnosis, and even criminology through the identification of typical criminal faces. However, his technique did not prove useful and fell into disuse, although after much work on it including by photographers [[Lewis Hine]] and [[John L. Lovell]] and [[Arthur Batut]].\n\n==Fingerprints==\nIn a [[Royal Institution]] paper in 1888 and three books (''[[Finger Prints (book)|Finger Prints]]'', 1892; ''Decipherment of Blurred Finger Prints'', 1893; and ''Fingerprint Directories'', 1895),{{sfn|Conklin|Gardner|Shortelle|2002|p=}} Galton estimated the probability of two persons having the same [[fingerprint]] and studied the heritability and racial differences in fingerprints. He wrote about the technique (inadvertently sparking a controversy between Herschel and Faulds that was to last until 1917), identifying common pattern in fingerprints and devising a classification system that survives to this day.\n\nThe method of identifying criminals by their fingerprints had been introduced in the 1860s by Sir [[William James Herschel]] in India, and their potential use in forensic work was first proposed by Dr [[Henry Faulds]] in 1880. Galton was introduced to the field by his half-cousin [[Charles Darwin]], who was a friend of Fauld's, and he went on to create the first scientific footing for the study (which assisted its acceptance by the courts{{sfn|Bulmer|2003|p=35}}) although Galton did not ever give credit that the original idea was not his.<ref name=\"BBC\" /> Galton pointed out that there were specific types of fingerprint patterns. He described and classified them into eight broad categories: 1: plain arch, 2: tented arch, 3: simple loop, 4: central pocket loop, 5: double loop, 6: lateral pocket loop, 7: plain whorl, and 8: accidental.{{sfn|Innes|2005|pp=32\u201333}}\n\n==Final years==\n[[File:Karl Pearson; Sir Francis Galton.jpg|thumb|Francis Galton (right), aged 87, on the stoep at Fox Holm, Cobham, with the statistician [[Karl Pearson]].]]\nIn an effort to reach a wider audience, Galton worked on a novel entitled ''Kantsaywhere'' from May until December 1910. The novel described a utopia organised by a eugenic religion, designed to breed [[Fitness (biology)|fitter]] and smarter humans. His unpublished notebooks show that this was an expansion of material he had been composing since at least 1901. He offered it to [[Methuen Publishing|Methuen]] for publication, but they showed little enthusiasm. Galton wrote to his niece that it should be either \"smothered or superseded\". His niece appears to have burnt most of the novel, offended by the love scenes, but large fragments survived,{{sfn|Pearson|1930a|p=413}} and it was published online by University College, London.{{sfn|Galton|Sargent|2001|pp=191-209}}\n\nGalton is buried in the family tomb in the churchyard of St Michael and All Angels, in the village of [[Claverdon]], [[Warwickshire]].<ref name=\"Challis\" />\n\n==Personal life and character==\nIn January 1853, Galton met [[Louisa Jane Butler]] (1822\u20131897) at his neighbour's home and they were married on 1 August 1853. The union of 43 years proved childless.{{sfn|Pearson|1914b|p=281}}<ref name=\"auden\" />\n[[File:Louisa Jane Galton00.jpg|thumb|right|upright|Louisa Jane Butler]]\n\nIt has been written of Galton that \"On his own estimation he was a supremely intelligent man.\"<ref>\"Robert Winston: eugenics has evil in its DNA\", Times, 23/2/20, https://www.thetimes.co.uk/edition/news-review/robert-winston-eugenics-has-evil-in-its-dna-2zzmk33tb </ref> Later in life, Galton proposed a connection between genius and insanity based on his own experience:{{quote|Men who leave their mark on the world are very often those who, being gifted and full of nervous power, are at the same time haunted and driven by a dominant idea, and are therefore within a measurable distance of insanity.|source={{harvnb|Pearson|1914, 1924, 1930}} }}\n\n==Awards and influence==\nOver the course of his career Galton received many awards, including the [[Copley Medal]] of the Royal Society (1910). He received in 1853 the Founder's Medal, the highest award of the [[Royal Geographical Society]], for his explorations and map-making of southwest Africa. He was elected a member of the [[Athenaeum Club, London|Athenaeum Club]] in 1855 and made a [[Fellow of the Royal Society]] in 1860. His [[autobiography]] also lists:{{sfn|Galton|1909|p=331}}\n\n* Silver Medal, French Geographical Society (1854)\n* Gold Medal of the Royal Society (1886)\n* Officier de l'Instruction Publique, France (1891)\n* D.C.L. Oxford (1894)\n* Sc.D. (Honorary), Cambridge (1895)\n* Huxley Medal, Anthropological Institute (1901)\n* Elected Hon. Fellow Trinity College, Cambridge (1902)\n* Darwin Medal, Royal Society (1902)\n* [[Linnean Society of London]]'s [[Darwin\u2013Wallace Medal]] (1908)\n\nGalton was knighted in 1909. His statistical heir [[Karl Pearson]], first holder of the Galton Chair of Eugenics at [[University College, London]] (now Galton Chair of Genetics), wrote a three-volume biography of Galton, in four parts, after his death.{{sfn|Pearson|1914a}}{{sfn|Pearson|1914b}}{{sfn|Pearson|1930a}}{{sfn|Pearson|1930b}}\n\nThe flowering plant genus ''[[Galtonia]]'' was named after Galton.\n\n[[University College London]] has in the twenty-first century been involved in a historical inquiry into its role as the institutional birthplace of eugenics. Galton established a laboratory at UCL in 1904. Some students and staff have called on the university to rename its Galton lecture theatre. \"Galton's seductive promise was of a bold new world filled only with beautiful, intelligent, productive people. The scientists in its thrall claimed this could be achieved by controlling reproduction, policing borders to prevent certain types of immigrants, and locking away \"undesirables\", including disabled people.\"<ref name=\"Saini2019\" />\n\n==Published works==\n{{refbegin}}\n\n*{{cite book|ref=harv|last=Galton |first=Francis |title=The art of travel, or, Shifts and contrivances available in wild

Francis Galton''', [[Fellow of the Royal Society|FRS]] ({{IPAc-en|\u02c8|g|\u0254\u02d0|l|t|\u0259n}}; 16 February 1822&nbsp;\u2013 17 January 1911) was an English [[Victorian era]] [[statistics|statistician]], [[polymath]], [[sociologist]], [[psychologist]],<ref name=\"famouspsychologists.org\" /> [[Anthropology|anthropologist]], [[Eugenics|eugenicist]], tropical [[Exploration|explorer]], [[geography|geographer]], [[Invention|inventor]], [[Meteorology|meteorologist]], proto-[[geneticist]], and [[Psychometrics|psychometrician]]. He was knighted in 1909.\n\nGalton produced over 340 papers and books. He also created the statistical concept of [[correlation]] and widely promoted [[regression toward the mean]]. He was the first to apply statistical methods to the study of human differences and [[inheritance of intelligence]], and introduced the use of [[questionnaires]] and [[Statistical survey|survey]]s for collecting data on human communities, which he needed for genealogical and biographical works and for his [[anthropometrics|anthropometric]] studies. He was a pioneer of [[eugenics]], coining the term itself in 1883, and also coined the phrase \"[[nature versus nurture]]\".{{sfn|Galton|1874|pp= 227\u2013236}} His book ''[[Hereditary Genius]]'' (1869) was the first social scientific attempt to study [[genius]] and [[greatness]].{{sfn|Galton|1869|p=}}\n\nAs an investigator of the human mind, he founded [[psychometrics]] (the science of measuring mental faculties) and [[differential psychology]], as well as the [[lexical hypothesis]] of personality. He devised a method for classifying [[fingerprint]]s that proved useful in [[forensic science]]. He also conducted research on the [[Efficacy of prayer|power of prayer]], concluding it had none due to its null effects on the longevity of those prayed for.{{sfn|Galton|1872|pp=125-135}} His quest for the scientific principles of diverse phenomena extended even to the optimal method for making tea.{{sfn|Galton|1855|p=208}}\n\nAs the initiator of scientific [[meteorology]], he devised the first [[weather map]], proposed a theory of [[anticyclone]]s, and was the first to establish a complete record of short-term climatic phenomena on a European scale.<ref name=\"scienceworld.wolfram.com\" /> He also invented the [[Dog whistle|Galton Whistle]] for testing differential hearing ability.{{sfn|Galton|1883|p=}} He was [[Charles Darwin]]'s half-cousin.{{sfn|Darwin|1887|p=5}}\n\n==Early life==\nGalton was born at \"The Larches\", a large house in the [[Sparkbrook]] area of [[Birmingham]], England, built on the site of \"Fair Hill\", the former home of [[Joseph Priestley]], which the [[botanist]] [[William Withering]] had renamed. He was [[Charles Darwin]]'s half-cousin, sharing the common grandparent [[Erasmus Darwin]]. His father was [[Samuel Tertius Galton]], son of [[Samuel \"John\" Galton]]. The Galtons were [[Quaker]] gun-manufacturers and bankers, while the Darwins were involved in medicine and science.\n\nHe was cousin of [[Douglas Strutt Galton]] and half-cousin of [[Charles Darwin]]. Both families had Fellows of the [[Royal Society]] and members who loved to invent in their spare time. Both Erasmus Darwin and Samuel Galton were founding members of the [[Lunar Society]] of Birmingham, which included [[Matthew Boulton|Boulton]], [[James Watt|Watt]], [[Josiah Wedgwood|Wedgwood]], [[Joseph Priestley|Priestley]], [[Richard Lovell Edgeworth|Edgeworth]]. Both families were known for their literary talent. Erasmus Darwin composed lengthy technical treatises in verse. Galton's aunt [[Mary Anne Galton]] wrote on aesthetics and religion, and her autobiography detailed the environment of her childhood populated by Lunar Society members.\n\n[[File:Sir Francis Galton by Octavius Oakley.jpg|thumb|upright|Portrait of Galton by [[Octavius Oakley]], 1840]]\n\nGalton was a [[child prodigy]]&nbsp;\u2013 he was reading by the age of two; at age five he knew some [[Ancient Greek|Greek]], [[Latin]] and long division, and by the age of six he had moved on to adult books, including [[Shakespeare]] for pleasure, and poetry, which he quoted at length.{{sfn|Bulmer|2003|p=4}} Galton attended [[King Edward's School, Birmingham]], but chafed at the narrow classical curriculum and left at 16.{{sfn|Cowan|2005}} His parents pressed him to enter the medical profession, and he studied for two years at [[Birmingham General Hospital]] and [[King's College London]] [[Medical School]]. He followed this up with mathematical studies at [[Trinity College, Cambridge|Trinity College]], [[University of Cambridge]], from 1840 to early 1844.<ref name=\"ACAD\" />\n\nAccording to the records of the [[United Grand Lodge of England]], it was in February 1844 that Galton became a [[freemason]] at the ''Scientific'' lodge, held at the Red Lion Inn in Cambridge, progressing through the three masonic degrees: Apprentice, 5 February 1844; Fellow Craft, 11 March 1844; Master Mason, 13 May 1844. A note in the record states: \"Francis Galton Trinity College student, gained his certificate 13 March 1845\".<ref name=\"Freemasonry\" /> One of Galton's masonic certificates from ''Scientific'' lodge can be found among his papers at [[University College, London]].<ref name=\"MerringtonGolden1976\" />\n\nA [[nervous breakdown]] prevented Galton's intent to try for honours. He elected instead to take a \"poll\" (pass) B.A. degree, like his half-cousin Charles Darwin.{{sfn|Bulmer|2003|p=5}} (Following the Cambridge custom, he was awarded an M.A. without further study, in 1847.) He briefly resumed his medical studies but the death of his father in 1844 left him emotionally destitute, though financially independent,{{Citation needed|date=May 2017}} and he terminated his medical studies entirely, turning to foreign travel, sport and technical invention.\n\nIn his early years Galton was an enthusiastic traveller, and made a notable solo trip through Eastern Europe to [[Constantinople]], before going up to Cambridge. In 1845 and 1846, he went to [[Egypt]] and travelled up the [[Nile]] to [[Khartoum]] in the [[Sudan]], and from there to [[Beirut]], [[Damascus]] and down the [[Jordan]].\n\nIn 1850 he joined the [[Royal Geographical Society]], and over the next two years mounted a long and difficult [[exploration|expedition]] into then little-known [[South West Africa]] (now [[Namibia]]). He wrote a book on his experience, \"Narrative of an Explorer in Tropical South Africa\".{{sfn|Galton|1853}} He was awarded the Royal Geographical Society's [[Gold Medal (RGS)|Founder's Gold Medal]] in 1853 and the Silver Medal of the French Geographical Society for his pioneering cartographic survey of the region.{{sfn|Bulmer|2003|p=16}} This established his reputation as a geographer and explorer. He proceeded to write the best-selling ''The Art of Travel'', a handbook of practical advice for the [[Victorian era|Victorian]] on the move, which went through many editions and is still in print.\n\n==Middle years==\n[[File:Francis_Galton_1850s.jpg|thumb|Galton in the 1850s]]\nGalton was a [[polymath]] who made important contributions in many fields of science, including [[meteorology]] (the [[anti-cyclone]] and the first popular weather maps), statistics (regression and correlation), [[psychology]] ([[synaesthesia]]), [[biology]] (the nature and mechanism of heredity), and [[criminology]] (fingerprints). Much of this was influenced by his [[penchant]] for counting and measuring. Galton prepared the first [[weather map]] published in ''[[The Times]]'' (1 April 1875, showing the weather from the previous day, 31 March), now a standard feature in newspapers worldwide.<ref name=\"meteor\" />\n\nHe became very active in the [[British Association for the Advancement of Science]], presenting many papers on a wide variety of topics at its meetings from 1858 to 1899.{{sfn|Bulmer|2003|p=29}} He was the general secretary from 1863 to 1867, president of the Geographical section in 1867 and 1872, and president of the Anthropological Section in 1877 and 1885. He was active on the council of the Royal Geographical Society for over forty years, in various committees of the Royal Society, and on the Meteorological Council.\n\n[[James McKeen Cattell]], a student of [[Wilhelm Wundt]] who had been reading Galton's articles, decided he wanted to study under him. He eventually built a professional relationship with Galton, measuring subjects and working together on research.{{sfn|Gillham|2001a|p=}}\n\nIn 1888, Galton established a lab in the science galleries of the South Kensington Museum. In Galton's lab, participants could be measured to gain knowledge of their strengths and weaknesses. Galton also used these data for his own research. He would typically charge people a small fee for his services.{{sfn|Hergenhahn|Henley|2013|p=288}}\n\nIn 1873, Galton wrote a controversial letter to ''[[The Times]]'' titled 'Africa for the Chinese', where he argued that the Chinese, as a race capable of high civilisation and only temporarily stunted by the recent failures of Chinese dynasties, should be encouraged to immigrate to Africa and displace the supposedly inferior aboriginal blacks.<ref name=\"TheTimes1873\" />\n\n==Heredity and eugenics==\n{{more citations needed|section|date=January 2018}}<!--first 4 paragraphs have no citations-->\n[[File:Francis Galton2.jpg|thumb|Galton in his later years]]\nThe publication by his cousin Charles Darwin of ''[[The Origin of Species]]'' in 1859 was an event that changed Galton's life .{{sfn|Forrest|1974|page=84}} He came to be gripped by the work, especially the first chapter on \"Variation under Domestication\", concerning [[animal breeding]].\n\nGalton devoted much of the rest of his life to exploring variation in human populations and its implications, at which Darwin had only hinted. In doing so, he established a research program which embraced multiple aspects of human variation, from mental characteristics to height; from facial images to fingerprint patterns. This required inventing novel measures of traits, devising large-scale collection of data using those measures, and in the end, the discovery of new statistical techniques for describing and understanding the data.\n\nGalton was interested at first in the question of whether human ability was [[hereditary]], and proposed to count the number of the relatives of various degrees of eminent men. If the qualities were hereditary, he reasoned, there should be more eminent men among the relatives than among the general population. To test this, he invented the methods of [[historiometry]]. Galton obtained extensive data from a broad range of biographical sources which he tabulated and compared in various ways. This pioneering work was described in detail in his book ''Hereditary Genius'' in 1869.{{sfn|Galton|1869|p=}} Here he showed, among other things, that the numbers of eminent relatives dropped off when going from the first degree to the second degree relatives, and from the second degree to the third. He took this as evidence of the [[inheritance of intelligence|inheritance of abilities]].\n\nGalton recognised the limitations of his methods in these two works, and believed the question could be better studied by comparisons of twins. His method envisaged testing to see if twins who were similar at birth diverged in dissimilar environments, and whether twins dissimilar at birth converged when reared in similar environments. He again used the method of questionnaires to gather various sorts of data, which were tabulated and described in a paper ''The history of twins'' in 1875. In so doing he anticipated the modern field of [[behaviour genetics]], which relies heavily on [[twin studies]]. He concluded that the evidence favoured nature rather than nurture. He also proposed [[adoption study|adoption studies]], including trans-racial adoption studies, to separate the effects of heredity and environment.\n\nGalton recognised that cultural circumstances influenced the capability of a civilisation's citizens, and their [[reproductive success]]. In ''Hereditary Genius'', he envisaged a situation conducive to resilient and enduring civilisation as follows:\n\n{{quote|\nThe best form of civilization in respect to the improvement of the race, would be one in which society was not costly; where incomes were chiefly derived from professional sources, and not much through inheritance; where every lad had a chance of showing his abilities, and, if highly gifted, was enabled to achieve a first-class education and entrance into professional life, by the liberal help of the exhibitions and scholarships which he had gained in his early youth; where marriage was held in as high honour as in ancient Jewish times; where the pride of race was encouraged (of course I do not refer to the nonsensical sentiment of the present day, that goes under that name); where the weak could find a welcome and a refuge in celibate monasteries or sisterhoods, and lastly, where the better sort of emigrants and refugees from other lands were invited and welcomed, and their descendants naturalised.\n|source={{harvnb|Galton|1869|p=362}} }}\n\nGalton invented the term ''[[eugenics]]'' in 1883 and set down many of his observations and conclusions in a book, ''[[Inquiries into Human Faculty and Its Development]]''. In the book's introduction, he wrote: {{quote|[This book's] intention is to touch on various topics more or less connected with that of the cultivation of race, or, as we might call it, with \"eugenic\"<sup>1</sup> questions, and to present the results of several of my own separate investigations.<br /><sup>1</sup> This is, with questions bearing on what is termed in Greek, ''eugenes'', namely, good in stock, hereditarily endowed with noble qualities. This, and the allied words, ''eugeneia'', etc., are equally applicable to men, brutes, and plants. We greatly want a brief word to express the science of improving stock, which is by no means confined to questions of judicious mating, but which, especially in the case of man, takes cognisance of all influences that tend in however remote a degree to give the more suitable races or strains of blood a better chance of prevailing speedily over the less suitable than they otherwise would have had. The word ''eugenics'' would sufficiently express the idea; it is at least a neater word and a more generalised one than ''viriculture'', which I once ventured to use.|source={{harvnb|Galton|1883|pp=24\u201325}} }}\n\nHe believed that a scheme of 'marks' for family merit should be defined, and early marriage between families of high rank be encouraged via provision of monetary incentives. He pointed out some of the tendencies in British society, such as the late marriages of eminent people, and the paucity of their children, which he thought were ''[[dysgenics|dysgenic]]''. He advocated encouraging eugenic marriages by supplying able couples with incentives to have children. On 29 October 1901, Galton chose to address eugenic issues when he delivered the second Huxley lecture at the Royal Anthropological Institute.{{sfn|Gillham|2001a|p=}}\n\n''[[The Eugenics Review]]'', the journal of the Eugenics Education Society, commenced publication in 1909. Galton, the Honorary President of the society, wrote the foreword for the first volume.{{sfn|Gillham|2001a|p=}} The First International Congress of Eugenics was held in July 1912. [[Winston Churchill]] and Carls Elliot were among the attendees.{{sfn|Gillham|2001a|p=}}\n\n== Model for population stability ==\n[[File:Sir Francis Galton, 1890s.jpg|thumb|left|Sir Francis Galton, 1890s]]\nGalton's formulation of regression and its link to the bivariate normal distribution can be traced to his attempts at developing a mathematical model for population stability. Although Galton's first attempt to study Darwinian questions,  ''Hereditary Genius'', generated little enthusiasm at the time, the text led to his further studies in the 1870s concerning the inheritance of physical traits.{{sfn|Stigler|2010|pp=469\u2013482}} This text contains some crude notions of the concept of regression, described in a qualitative matter. For example, he wrote of dogs: \"If a man breeds from strong, well-shaped dogs, but of mixed pedigree, the puppies will be sometimes, but rarely, the equals of their parents. they will commonly be of a mongrel, nondescript type, because ancestral peculiarities are apt to crop out in the offspring.\"{{sfn|Galton|1914|p=57}}\n\nThis notion created a problem for Galton, as he could not reconcile the tendency of a population to maintain a normal distribution of traits from generation to generation with the notion of inheritance. It seemed that a large number of factors operated independently on offspring,  leading to the normal distribution of a trait in each generation. However, this provided no explanation as to how a parent can have a significant impact on his offspring, which was the basis of inheritance.{{sfn|Stigler|1986|pp=265\u2013299}}\n\nGalton's solution to this problem was presented in his Presidential Address at the September 1885 meeting of the [[British Association for the Advancement of Science]], as he was serving at the time as President of Section H: Anthropology.<ref name=\":3\">{{Cite journal|last=Galton|first=Francis|year=1885|title=Opening address as President of the Anthropology Section of the British Association for the Advancement of Science, September 10th, 1885, at Aberdeen|journal=Nature|volume=32|pages=507\u2013510}}</ref> The address was published in ''[[Nature (journal)|Nature]],'' and Galton further developed the theory in  \"Regression toward mediocrity in hereditary stature\" and \"Hereditary Stature.\"{{sfn|Galton|1886|pp=246\u2013263}}{{sfn|Galton|1886b|pp=295\u2013298}} An elaboration of this theory was published in 1889 in ''Natural Inheritance.'' There were three key developments that helped Galton develop this theory: the  development of the law of error in 1874&ndash;1875, the formulation of an empirical law of reversion in 1877, and the development of a mathematical framework encompassing regression using human population data during 1885.{{sfn|Stigler|1986|pp=265\u2013299}}\n\nGalton's development of the law of regression to the mean, or reversion, was due to insights from the [[Bean machine|quincunx]] ('bean machine') and his studies of sweet peas. While Galton had previously invented the quincunx prior to February 1874, the 1877 version of the quincunx had a new feature that helped Galton demonstrate that a normal mixture of normal distributions is also normal.{{sfn|Galton|1877|pp=492\u2013495, 512\u2013514, 532\u2013533}} Galton demonstrated this using a new version of quincunx, adding chutes to the apparatus to represent reversion. When the pellets passed through the curved chutes (representing reversion) and then the pins (representing family variability), the result was a stable population. On Friday 19 February 1877 Galton gave a lecture entitled ''Typical Laws of Heredity'' at the [[Royal Institution]] in London.{{sfn|Galton|1877|pp=492\u2013495, 512\u2013514, 532\u2013533}} In this lecture, he posed that there must a counteracting force to maintain population stability. However, this model required a much larger degree of intergenerational natural selection than was plausible.{{sfn|Stigler|2010|pp=469\u2013482}}\n\nIn 1875, Galton started growing sweet peas, and addressed the Royal Institution on his findings on 9 February 1877.{{sfn|Galton|1877|pp=492\u2013495, 512\u2013514, 532\u2013533}} He found that each group of progeny seeds followed a normal curve, and the curves were equally disperse. Each group was not centered about the parent's weight, but rather at a weight closer to the population average. Galton called this reversion, as every progeny group was distributed at a value that was closer to the population average than the parent. The deviation from the population average was in the same direction, but the magnitude of the deviation was only one-third as large. In doing so, Galton demonstrated that there was variability among each of the families, yet the families combined to produce a stable, normally distributed population. When Galton addressed the British Association for the Advancement of Science in 1885, he said of his investigation of sweet peas, \"I was then blind to what I now perceive to be the simple explanation of the phenomenon.\"<ref name=\":3\" />\n\nGalton was able to further his notion of regression by collecting and analyzing data on human stature. Galton asked for help of mathematician J. Hamilton Dickson in investigating the geometric relationship of the data. He determined that the regression coefficient did not ensure population stability by chance, but rather that the regression coefficient, conditional variance, and population were interdependent quantities related by a simple equation.{{sfn|Stigler|1986|pp=265\u2013299}} Thus Galton identified that the linearity of regression was not coincidental but rather was a necessary consequence of population stability.\n\nThe model for population stability resulted in Galton's formulation of the Law of Ancestral Heredity.  This law, which was published in ''Natural Inheritance,'' states that the two parents of an offspring jointly contribute one half of an offspring's heritage, while the other, more-removed ancestors constitute a  smaller proportion of the offspring's heritage.{{sfn|Bulmer|1998|pp=579\u2013585}} Galton viewed reversion as a spring, that when stretched, would return the distribution of traits back to the normal distribution. He concluded that evolution would have to occur via discontinuous steps, as reversion would neutralize any incremental steps.{{sfn|Gillham|2001b|pp=1383\u20131392}} When [[Mendelian inheritance|Mendel's]] principles were rediscovered in 1900, this resulted in a fierce battle between the followers of Galton's Law of Ancestral Heredity, the biometricians, and those who advocated Mendel's principles.{{sfn|Gillham|2013|pp=61\u201375}}\n\n==Empirical test of pangenesis and Lamarckism==\nGalton conducted wide-ranging inquiries into heredity which led him to challenge Charles Darwin's hypothesis of [[pangenesis]]. Darwin had proposed as part of this model that certain particles, which he called \"[[gemmules]]\" moved throughout the body and were also responsible for the inheritance of acquired characteristics. Galton, in consultation with Darwin, set out to see if they were transported in the blood. In a long series of experiments in 1869 to 1871, he transfused the blood between dissimilar breeds of rabbits, and examined the features of their offspring.<ref name=\"abc.net.au\" /> He found no evidence of characters transmitted in the transfused blood.{{sfn|Bulmer|2003|pp=116\u2013118}}\n\nDarwin challenged the validity of Galton's experiment, giving his reasons in an article published in ''[[Nature (journal)|Nature]]'' where he wrote:\n\n{{quote|\nNow, in the chapter on Pangenesis in my ''[[Variation of Animals and Plants under Domestication]]'' I have not said one word about the blood, or about any fluid proper to any circulating system. It is, indeed, obvious that the presence of gemmules in the blood can form no necessary part of my hypothesis; for I refer in illustration of it to the lowest animals, such as the Protozoa, which do not possess blood or any vessels; and I refer to plants in which the fluid, when present in the vessels, cannot be considered as true blood. The fundamental laws of growth, reproduction, inheritance, &c., are so closely similar throughout the whole organic kingdom, that the means by which the gemmules (assuming for the moment their existence) are diffused through the body, would probably be the same in all beings; therefore the means can hardly be diffusion through the blood. Nevertheless, when I first heard of Mr. Galton's experiments, I did not sufficiently reflect on the subject, and saw not the difficulty of believing in the presence of gemmules in the blood.\n|source={{harvnb|Darwin|1871|pp=502\u2013503}} }}\n\nGalton explicitly rejected the idea of the [[inheritance of acquired characteristics]] ([[Lamarckism]]), and was an early proponent of \"hard heredity\" {{sfn|Bulmer|2003|pp=105\u2013107}} through selection alone. He came close to rediscovering Mendel's particulate theory of inheritance, but was prevented from making the final breakthrough in this regard because of his focus on continuous, rather than discrete, traits (now known as [[polygenic]] traits). He went on to found the [[Biostatistics|biometric]] approach to the study of heredity, distinguished by its use of statistical techniques to study continuous traits and population-scale aspects of heredity.\n\nThis approach was later taken up enthusiastically by [[Karl Pearson]] and [[Raphael Weldon|W. F. R. Weldon]]; together, they founded the highly influential journal ''[[Biometrika]]'' in 1901.  ([[R. A. Fisher]] would later show how the biometrical approach could be reconciled with the Mendelian approach.{{sfn|Nelson|Pettersson|Carlborg|2013|pp=669\u2013676}}) The statistical techniques that Galton invented (correlation and regression\u2014see below) and phenomena he established (regression to the mean) formed the basis of the biometric approach and are now essential tools in all the social sciences.\n\n== Anthropometric Laboratory at the 1884 International Health Exhibition ==\nIn 1884, London hosted the International Health Exhibition. This exhibition placed much emphasis on highlighting Victorian developments in sanitation and public health, and allowed the nation to display its advanced public health outreach, compared to other countries at the time. Francis Galton took advantage of this opportunity to set up his anthropometric laboratory. He stated that the purpose of this laboratory was to \"show the public the simplicity of the instruments and methods by which the chief physical characteristics of man may be measured and recorded.\"{{sfn|Galton|1885|pp=205-221}} The laboratory was an interactive walk-through in which physical characteristics such as height, weight, and eyesight, would be measured for each subject after payment of an admission fee. Upon entering the laboratory, a subject would visit the following stations in order.\n\nFirst, they would fill out a form with personal and family history (age, birthplace, marital status, residence, and occupation), then visit stations that recorded hair and eye color, followed by the keenness, color-sense, and depth perception of sight. Next, they would examine the keenness, or relative acuteness, of hearing and highest audible note of their hearing followed by an examination of their sense of touch. However, because the surrounding area was noisy, the apparatus intended to measure hearing was rendered ineffective by the noise and echoes in the building. Their breathing capacity would also be measured, as well as their ability to throw a punch. The next stations would examine strength of both pulling and squeezing with both hands. Lastly, subjects' heights in various positions (sitting, standing, etc.) as well as arm span and weight would be measured.{{sfn|Galton|1885|pp=205-221}}\n\nOne excluded characteristic of interest was the size of the head. Galton notes in his analysis that this omission was mostly for practical reasons. For instance, it would not be very accurate and additionally it would require much time for women to disassemble and reassemble their hair and bonnets.{{sfn|Galton|1884|p=}} The patrons would then be given a souvenir containing all their biological data, while Galton would also keep a copy for future statistical research.\n\nAlthough the laboratory did not employ any revolutionary measurement techniques, it was unique because of the simple logistics of constructing such a demonstration within a limited space, and because of the speed and efficiency with which all the necessary data were gathered. The laboratory itself was a see-through (lattice-walled) fenced off gallery measuring 36 feet long by 6 feet long. To collect data efficiently, Galton had to make the process as simple as possible for people to understand. As a result, subjects were taken through the laboratory in pairs so that explanations could be given to two at a time, also in the hope that one of the two would confidently take the initiative to go through all the tests first, encouraging the other. With this design, the total time spent in the exhibit was fourteen minutes for each pair.{{sfn|Galton|1885|pp=205-221}}\n\nGalton states that the measurements of human characteristics are useful for two reasons. First, he states that measuring physical characteristics is useful in order to ensure, on a more domestic level, that children are developing properly. A useful example he gives for the practicality of these domestic measurements is regularly checking a child's eyesight, in order to correct any deficiencies early on. The second use for the data from his anthropometric laboratory is for statistical studies. He comments on the usefulness of the collected data to compare attributes across occupations, residences, races, etc.{{sfn|Galton|1885|pp=205-221}} The exhibit at the health exhibition allowed Galton to collect a large amount of raw data from which to conduct further comparative studies. He had 9,337 respondents, each measured in 17 categories, creating a rather comprehensive statistical database.{{sfn|Galton|1884|p=}}\n\nAfter the conclusion of the International Health Exhibition, Galton used these data to confirm in humans his theory of linear regression, posed after studying sweet peas. The accumulation of this human data allowed him to observe the correlation between forearm length and height, head width and head breadth, and head length and height. With these observations he was able to write ''Co-relations and their Measurements, chiefly from Anthropometric Data''.{{sfn|Gillham|2001c|pp=82-102}} In this publication, Galton defined what co-relation as a phenomenon that occurs when \"the variation of the one [variable] is accompanied on the average by more or less variation of the other, and in the same direction.\"{{sfn|Galton|1888|pp=273-279}}\n\n==Innovations in statistics and psychological theory==\n\n===Historiometry===\nThe method used in ''Hereditary Genius'' has been described as the first example of [[historiometry]]. To bolster these results, and to attempt to make a distinction between 'nature' and 'nurture' (he was the first to apply this phrase to the topic), he devised a questionnaire that he sent out to 190 [[Fellows of the Royal Society]]. He tabulated characteristics of their families, such as [[birth order]] and the occupation and [[Race (classification of human beings)|race]] of their parents. He attempted to discover whether their interest in science was 'innate' or due to the encouragements of others. The studies were published as a book, ''English men of science: their nature and nurture'', in 1874. In the end, it promoted the [[nature versus nurture]] question, though it did not settle it, and provided some fascinating data on the sociology of scientists of the time.{{Citation needed|date=February 2020}}\n\n===The lexical hypothesis===\nSir Francis was the first scientist to recognise what is now known as the [[lexical hypothesis]].{{sfn|Caprara|Cervone|2000|p=68}} This is the idea that the most salient and socially relevant personality differences in people's lives will eventually become encoded into language. The hypothesis further suggests that by sampling language, it is possible to derive a comprehensive taxonomy of human [[personality traits]].\n\n===The questionnaire===\nGalton's inquiries into the mind involved detailed recording of people's subjective accounts of whether and how their minds dealt with phenomena such as [[visual memory|mental imagery]]. To better elicit this information, he pioneered the use of the [[questionnaire]]. In one study, he asked his fellow members of the Royal Society of London to describe mental images that they experienced. In another, he collected in-depth surveys from eminent scientists for a work examining the effects of nature and nurture on the propensity toward scientific thinking.{{sfn|Clauser|2007|pp=440-444}}\n\n===Variance and standard deviation===\nCore to any statistical analysis is the concept that measurements vary: they have both a [[central tendency]], or mean, and a spread around this central value, or [[variance]]. In the late 1860s, Galton conceived of a measure to quantify normal variation: the [[standard deviation]].<ref>{{cite web|author=Chad Denby |url=http://www.sciencetimeline.net/1866.htm |title=Science Timeline |publisher=Science Timeline |accessdate=22 April 2013}}</ref>\n\nGalton was a keen observer. In 1906, visiting a livestock fair, he stumbled upon an intriguing contest. An ox was on display, and the villagers were invited to guess the animal's weight after it was slaughtered and dressed. Nearly 800 participated, and Galton was able to study their individual entries after the event. Galton stated that \"the middlemost estimate expresses the ''vox populi'', every other estimate being condemned as too low or too high by a majority of the voters\",{{sfn|Galton|1907|p=450}} and reported this value (the [[median]], in terminology he himself had introduced, but chose not to use on this occasion) as 1,207 pounds. To his surprise, this was within 0.8% of the weight measured by the judges. Soon afterwards, in response to an enquiry, he reported<ref>\"[http://galton.org/cgi-bin/searchImages/galton/search/essays/pages/galton-1907-ballot-box_1.htm The Ballot Box]\", ''Nature'', 28 March 1907</ref> the mean of the guesses as 1,197 pounds, but did not comment on its improved accuracy.  Recent archival research{{sfn|Wallis|2014|pp=420-424}} has found some slips in transmitting Galton's calculations to the original article in ''Nature'': the median was actually 1,208 pounds, and the dressed weight of the ox 1,197 pounds, so the mean estimate had zero error.  James Surowiecki{{sfn|Surowiecki|2004|p=}} uses this weight-judging competition as his opening example: had he known the true result, his conclusion on the wisdom of the crowd would no doubt have been more strongly expressed.\n\nThe same year, Galton suggested in a letter to the journal ''[[Nature (journal)|Nature]]'' a better method of cutting a round cake by avoiding making radial incisions.{{sfn|Galton|1906|p=173}}\n\n===Experimental derivation of the normal distribution===\n[[File:Quincunx (Galton Box) - Galton 1889 diagram.png|thumb|Galton's 1889 illustration of the quincunx or [[bean machine]].]]\nStudying variation, Galton invented the quincunx, a [[pachinko]]-like device also known as the [[bean machine]], as a tool for demonstrating the [[law of error]] and the [[normal distribution]].{{sfn|Bulmer|2003|p=4}}\n\n===Bivariate normal distribution===\nHe also discovered the properties of the [[bivariate normal distribution]] and its relationship to [[regression analysis]].\n\n===Correlation and regression===\n[[File:Galton's correlation diagram 1875.jpg|thumb|Galton's correlation diagram 1886{{sfn|Galton |1886|p= 248|loc=[https://books.google.com/books?id=JPcRAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA248-IA3#v=onepage Plate X]}}]]\nIn 1846, the French physicist [[Auguste Bravais]] (1811\u20131863) first developed what would become the correlation coefficient.{{sfn|Bravais|1846|pp=255-332}} After examining forearm and height measurements, Galton independently rediscovered the concept of [[correlation]] in 1888{{sfn|Galton|1888|pp=135-145}}{{sfn|Bulmer|2003|pp=191\u2013196}} and demonstrated its application in the study of heredity, anthropology, and psychology.{{sfn|Clauser|2007|pp=440-444}} Galton's later statistical study of the probability of extinction of surnames led to the concept of [[Galton\u2013Watson process|Galton\u2013Watson stochastic processes]].{{sfn|Bulmer|2003|pp=182\u2013184}} This is now a core of modern statistics and regression.\n\nGalton invented the use of the regression line{{sfn|Bulmer|2003|p=184}} and for the choice of r (for reversion or regression) to represent the correlation coefficient.{{sfn|Clauser|2007|pp=440-444}}\n\nIn the 1870s and 1880s he was a pioneer in the use of [[normal distribution|normal theory]] to fit [[histogram]]s and [[Ogive (statistics)|ogives]] to actual tabulated data, much of which he collected himself: for instance [[big data|large samples]] of sibling and parental height. Consideration of the results from these empirical studies led to his further insights into evolution, natural selection, and regression to the mean.\n\n===Regression toward the mean===\nGalton was the first to describe and explain the common phenomenon of [[regression toward the mean]], which he first observed in his experiments on the size of the seeds of successive generations of sweet peas.\n\nThe conditions under which regression toward the mean occurs depend on the way the term is mathematically defined. Galton first observed the phenomenon in the context of [[simple linear regression]] of data points. Galton{{sfn|Galton|1889|p=}} developed the following model: pellets fall through a ''[[quincunx]]'' or \"[[bean machine]]\" forming a normal distribution centered directly under their entrance point. These pellets could then be released down into a second gallery (corresponding to a second measurement occasion). Galton then asked the reverse question \"from where did these pellets come?\"\n{{quote|\nThe answer was not \"on average directly above\". Rather it was \"on average, more towards the middle\", for the simple reason that there were more pellets above it towards the middle that could wander left than there were in the left extreme that could wander to the right, inwards.|\nsource={{harvnb|Stigler|2010|p=477}} }}\n\n===Theories of perception===\nGalton went beyond measurement and summary to attempt to explain the phenomena he observed. Among such developments, he proposed an early theory of ranges of sound and [[hearing (sense)|hearing]], and collected large quantities of anthropometric data from the public through his popular and long-running Anthropometric Laboratory, which he established in 1884, and where he studied over 9,000 people.{{sfn|Gillham|2001a|p=}} It was not until 1985 that these data were analysed in their entirety.\n\n===Differential psychology===\nGalton's study of human abilities ultimately led to the foundation of [[differential psychology]] and the formulation of the first mental tests. He was interested in measuring humans in every way possible. This included measuring their ability to make sensory discrimination which he assumed was linked to intellectual prowess. Galton suggested that individual differences in general ability are reflected in performance on relatively simple sensory capacities and in speed of reaction to a stimulus, variables that could be objectively measured by tests of sensory discrimination and reaction\ntime.{{sfn|Jensen|2002|pp=145-172}} He also measured how quickly people reacted which he later linked to internal wiring which ultimately limited intelligence ability. Throughout his research Galton assumed that people who reacted faster were more intelligent than others.\n\n===Composite photography===\nGalton also devised a technique called \"[[composite portrait]]ure\" (produced by superimposing multiple photographic portraits of individuals' faces registered on their eyes) to create an average face (see [[averageness]]). In the 1990s, a hundred years after his discovery, much psychological research has examined the [[attractiveness]] of these faces, an aspect that Galton had remarked on in his original lecture. Others, including [[Sigmund Freud]] in his work on dreams, picked up Galton's suggestion that these composites might represent a useful metaphor for an [[Ideal type]] or a [[concept]] of a \"[[natural kind]]\" (see [[Eleanor Rosch]])\u2014such as Jewish men, criminals, patients with tuberculosis, etc.\u2014onto the same photographic plate, thereby yielding a blended whole, or \"composite\", that he hoped could generalise the facial appearance of his subject into an \"average\" or \"central type\".{{sfn|Galton|1883|p=}}{{sfn|Galton|1878|pp=132\u2013142}} (See also entry ''Modern physiognomy'' under [[Physiognomy]]).\n\nThis work began in the 1880s while the Jewish scholar [[Joseph Jacobs]] studied anthropology and statistics with Francis Galton. Jacobs asked Galton to create a composite photograph of a Jewish type.{{sfn|Novak|2008|p=100}} One of Jacobs' first publications that used Galton's composite imagery was \"The Jewish Type, and Galton's Composite Photographs,\" ''Photographic News'', 29, (24 April 1885): 268\u2013269.\n\nGalton hoped his technique would aid medical diagnosis, and even criminology through the identification of typical criminal faces. However, his technique did not prove useful and fell into disuse, although after much work on it including by photographers [[Lewis Hine]] and [[John L. Lovell]] and [[Arthur Batut]].\n\n==Fingerprints==\nIn a [[Royal Institution]] paper in 1888 and three books (''[[Finger Prints (book)|Finger Prints]]'', 1892; ''Decipherment of Blurred Finger Prints'', 1893; and ''Fingerprint Directories'', 1895),{{sfn|Conklin|Gardner|Shortelle|2002|p=}} Galton estimated the probability of two persons having the same [[fingerprint]] and studied the heritability and racial differences in fingerprints. He wrote about the technique (inadvertently sparking a controversy between Herschel and Faulds that was to last until 1917), identifying common pattern in fingerprints and devising a classification system that survives to this day.\n\nThe method of identifying criminals by their fingerprints had been introduced in the 1860s by Sir [[William James Herschel]] in India, and their potential use in forensic work was first proposed by Dr [[Henry Faulds]] in 1880. Galton was introduced to the field by his half-cousin [[Charles Darwin]], who was a friend of Fauld's, and he went on to create the first scientific footing for the study (which assisted its acceptance by the courts{{sfn|Bulmer|2003|p=35}}) although Galton did not ever give credit that the original idea was not his.<ref name=\"BBC\" /> Galton pointed out that there were specific types of fingerprint patterns. He described and classified them into eight broad categories: 1: plain arch, 2: tented arch, 3: simple loop, 4: central pocket loop, 5: double loop, 6: lateral pocket loop, 7: plain whorl, and 8: accidental.{{sfn|Innes|2005|pp=32\u201333}}\n\n==Final years==\n[[File:Karl Pearson; Sir Francis Galton.jpg|thumb|Francis Galton (right), aged 87, on the stoep at Fox Holm, Cobham, with the statistician [[Karl Pearson]].]]\nIn an effort to reach a wider audience, Galton worked on a novel entitled ''Kantsaywhere'' from May until December 1910. The novel described a utopia organised by a eugenic religion, designed to breed [[Fitness (biology)|fitter]] and smarter humans. His unpublished notebooks show that this was an expansion of material he had been composing since at least 1901. He offered it to [[Methuen Publishing|Methuen]] for publication, but they showed little enthusiasm. Galton wrote to his niece that it should be either \"smothered or superseded\". His niece appears to have burnt most of the novel, offended by the love scenes, but large fragments survived,{{sfn|Pearson|1930a|p=413}} and it was published online by University College, London.{{sfn|Galton|Sargent|2001|pp=191-209}}\n\nGalton is buried in the family tomb in the churchyard of St Michael and All Angels, in the village of [[Claverdon]], [[Warwickshire]].<ref name=\"Challis\" />\n\n==Personal life and character==\nIn January 1853, Galton met [[Louisa Jane Butler]] (1822\u20131897) at his neighbour's home and they were married on 1 August 1853.

His statistical heir [[Karl Pearson]], first holder of the Galton Chair of Eugenics at [[University College, London]] (now Galton Chair of Genetics), wrote a three-volume biography of Galton, in four parts, after his death.{{sfn|Pearson|1914a}}{{sfn|Pearson|1914b}}{{sfn|Pearson|1930a}}{{sfn|Pearson|1930b}}\n\nThe flowering plant genus ''[[Galtonia]]'' was named after Galton.\n\n[[University College London]] has in the twenty-first century been involved in a historical inquiry into its role as the institutional birthplace of eugenics. Galton established a laboratory at UCL in 1904. Some students and staff have called on the university to rename its Galton lecture theatre. \"Galton's seductive promise was of a bold new world filled only with beautiful, intelligent, productive people. The scientists in its thrall claimed this could be achieved by controlling reproduction, policing borders to prevent certain types of immigrants, and locking away \"undesirables\", including disabled people.\"<ref name=\"Saini2019\" />\n\n==Published works==\n{{refbegin}}\n\n*{{cite book|ref=harv|last=Galton |first=Francis |title=The art of travel, or, Shifts and contrivances available in wild

The L7 is a [[105 mm]] L/52 rifled design by the [[Royal Ordnance Factories]] intended for use in [[armoured fighting vehicle]]s, replacing the earlier [[Ordnance QF 20 pounder|20-pounder]] (84&nbsp;mm) tank gun mounted on the [[Centurion tank]].<ref>Starry, p. 113</ref> The successful L7 gun has been fitted on many armored vehicles including the British Centurion (starting from the Mk. 5/2 variant), the German [[Leopard 1]] and early variants of the US [[M1 Abrams]] (M1 and IPM1).\n\nThe L7 is a popular weapon and continued in use even after it was superseded by the [[Royal Ordnance L11A5|L11 series 120&nbsp;mm]] rifled tank gun, for some Centurion tanks operating as Artillery Forward Observation and Armoured Vehicle, [[Royal Engineers]] ([[Armoured Vehicle Royal Engineers|AVRE]]) vehicles. The L7, and adaptations of it, can be found as standard or retrofitted equipment on a wide variety of tanks developed during the Cold War.\n\n==History==\n[[Image:105mm tank gun Rifling.jpg|thumb|L7 105 mm tank cut gun barrel model on display at the [[Deutsches Panzermuseum]].]]\nBoth the United Kingdom and the United States had been developing projects for large calibered guns during WWII in order to compete with increasing heavily armored German, and later for [[Cold War]] Soviet tanks. The US developed several heavy tank designs during this period, notable were the US [[105 mm Gun T5]] (later renamed 105 mm Gun Motor Carriage T95) as well as the British A39 Tortoise heavy tanks.\n\nThe US foresaw difficulties in engagements against the Soviet [[IS tank family|IS-3 and 4]] with its M48 Patton. This led to the introduction of the [[M103 heavy tank|M103]], a [[heavy tank]] designed to counter [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] heavy tanks. It mounted an extremely powerful 120&nbsp;mm cannon but the ammunition was so large that it required two loaders, one for the shell and another for the separate propellant charge. Of the 300 M103s built, most went to the Marines.<ref>Hunnicut/Firepower</ref> The UK came to the same conclusions and developed their own heavy tank, the [[Conqueror (tank)|Conqueror]], which mounted the US 120&nbsp;mm gun.\n\n===United Kingdom===\nDuring the Hungarian Revolution of 1956, a Soviet T-54A medium tank was driven onto the grounds of the British embassy in Budapest by the Hungarians. After a brief examination of this tank's armor and 100 mm gun, British officials decided that the 20 pounder was apparently incapable of defeating its frontal armor. This meant the most common British tanks were no longer able to deal with Soviet medium tank designs, let alone their heavy tanks.\n\nThese events spurred the United Kingdom to develop a new tank gun in 1956, the Royal Ordnance L7 to keep the Centurion viable against this new Soviet tank design and the United States to develop the XM60 tank in 1957. The L7 was specifically designed to fit into the turret mountings of the 20 pounder. This would enable the [[Centurion (tank)|Centurion]] tanks to be up-gunned with minimum modifications; hence, the fleet could be upgraded in a shorter time and at a lower cost.\n\nUser trials of the weapon began in 1959. The first tank to be equipped with the L7 was a single up-armoured Centurion Mark 7 in 1959 which was to prove the viability of up-armouring and up-gunning the Centurion. From 1959 onwards existing Centurions were given upgrades with the L7 gun and armour and new builds incorporated the L7 at production.<ref>Dunstan p24</ref>\n\n===United States===\nThe main gun for the M60 tank series was chosen after a comparative firing test of six different guns carried out on the Aberdeen Proving Grounds in 1958. The factors evaluated were accuracy, the lethality of a hit, rate of fire, and penetration performance.{{sfn|Hunnicutt|1984|pages= 151-152 }} Based on these tests, the 105&nbsp;mm '''T254E1''' was selected, modified to the '''T254E2''' and standardized as the '''Cannon, 105-MM Gun, M68'''. They are licensed built US variants of the L7. The T254E2/M68 used a vertical sliding breechblock instead of the T254E1's horizontal breechblock. Until American-made barrels could be obtained with comparable accuracy, British X15/L52 barrels mounting a concentric bore evacuator on the barrel were to be used.{{sfn|Hunnicutt|1984|page= 155 }} US built XM24/L52 barrels (length 218.5 inches)<ref >{{cite web|url=http://www.williammaloney.com/Aviation/WatervlietArsenalMuseum/TankCannon/pages/09M68_105mmGun.htm|title=09 M68 105mm Gun|website=www.williammaloney.com|access-date=2019-05-31|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180121075334/http://www.williammaloney.com/Aviation/WatervlietArsenalMuseum/TankCannon/pages/09M68_105mmGun.htm|archive-date=2018-01-21|url-status=live}}</ref> fitted with an eccentric bore evacuator were used for the M60-series starting in June 1959 but retained interchangeability with the British X15/L52 barrel.{{sfn|Hunnicutt|1984|page= 152 }} All of the US guns and XM24 barrels were produced at the [[Watervliet Arsenal]], NY and the gun mounts (M116 for the M60 and M140 for the M60A1/A3) manufactured at the [[Rock Island Arsenal]], IL.<ref >{{cite web |url= https://www.gao.gov/assets/190/188401.pdf|title=Procurement report |date=1976 |website= www.gao.gov|format=PDF|access-date=2020-04-11}}</ref> US M68 guns were fitted with an eccentric bore evacuator instead of a concentric model in order to provide more clearance over the rear deck of the tank.<ref name=\"Organizational Maintenance Manual--Tank 2306\">TM 9-2350-253-20-2 Organizational Maintenance Manual--Tank, Combat, Full Tracked: 105-mm Gun, M60A3 (2350-00-148-6548) and (2350-01-061-2306) TTS Turret.

The L7 is a [[105 mm]] L/52 rifled design by the [[Royal Ordnance Factories]] intended for use in [[armoured fighting vehicle]]s, replacing the earlier [[Ordnance QF 20 pounder|20-pounder]] (84&nbsp;mm) tank gun mounted on the [[Centurion tank]].<ref>Starry, p. 113</ref> The successful L7 gun has been fitted on many armored vehicles including the British Centurion (starting from the Mk. 5/2 variant), the German [[Leopard 1]] and early variants of the US [[M1 Abrams]] (M1 and IPM1).\n\nThe L7 is a popular weapon and continued in use even after it was superseded by the [[Royal Ordnance L11A5|L11 series 120&nbsp;mm]] rifled tank gun, for some Centurion tanks operating as Artillery Forward Observation and Armoured Vehicle, [[Royal Engineers]] ([[Armoured Vehicle Royal Engineers|AVRE]]) vehicles. The L7, and adaptations of it, can be found as standard or retrofitted equipment on a wide variety of tanks developed during the Cold War.\n\n==History==\n[[Image:105mm tank gun Rifling.jpg|thumb|L7 105 mm tank cut gun barrel model on display at the [[Deutsches Panzermuseum]].]]\nBoth the United Kingdom and the United States had been developing projects for large calibered guns during WWII in order to compete with increasing heavily armored German, and later for [[Cold War]] Soviet tanks. The US developed several heavy tank designs during this period, notable were the US [[105 mm Gun T5]] (later renamed 105 mm Gun Motor Carriage T95) as well as the British A39 Tortoise heavy tanks.\n\nThe US foresaw difficulties in engagements against the Soviet [[IS tank family|IS-3 and 4]] with its M48 Patton. This led to the introduction of the [[M103 heavy tank|M103]], a [[heavy tank]] designed to counter [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] heavy tanks. It mounted an extremely powerful 120&nbsp;mm cannon but the ammunition was so large that it required two loaders, one for the shell and another for the separate propellant charge. Of the 300 M103s built, most went to the Marines.<ref>Hunnicut/Firepower</ref> The UK came to the same conclusions and developed their own heavy tank, the [[Conqueror (tank)|Conqueror]], which mounted the US 120&nbsp;mm gun.\n\n===United Kingdom===\nDuring the Hungarian Revolution of 1956, a Soviet T-54A medium tank was driven onto the grounds of the British embassy in Budapest by the Hungarians. After a brief examination of this tank's armor and 100 mm gun, British officials decided that the 20 pounder was apparently incapable of defeating its frontal armor. This meant the most common British tanks were no longer able to deal with Soviet medium tank designs, let alone their heavy tanks.\n\nThese events spurred the United Kingdom to develop a new tank gun in 1956, the Royal Ordnance L7 to keep the Centurion viable against this new Soviet tank design and the United States to develop the XM60 tank in 1957. The L7 was specifically designed to fit into the turret mountings of the 20 pounder. This would enable the [[Centurion (tank)|Centurion]] tanks to be up-gunned with minimum modifications; hence, the fleet could be upgraded in a shorter time and at a lower cost.\n\nUser trials of the weapon began in 1959. The first tank to be equipped with the L7 was a single up-armoured Centurion Mark 7 in 1959 which was to prove the viability of up-armouring and up-gunning the Centurion. From 1959 onwards existing Centurions were given upgrades with the L7 gun and armour and new builds incorporated the L7 at production.<ref>Dunstan p24</ref>\n\n===United States===\nThe main gun for the M60 tank series was chosen after a comparative firing test of six different guns carried out on the Aberdeen Proving Grounds in 1958. The factors evaluated were accuracy, the lethality of a hit, rate of fire, and penetration performance.{{sfn|Hunnicutt|1984|pages= 151-152 }} Based on these tests, the 105&nbsp;mm '''T254E1''' was selected, modified to the '''T254E2''' and standardized as the '''Cannon, 105-MM Gun, M68'''. They are licensed built US variants of the L7. The T254E2/M68 used a vertical sliding breechblock instead of the T254E1's horizontal breechblock. Until American-made barrels could be obtained with comparable accuracy, British X15/L52 barrels mounting a concentric bore evacuator on the barrel were to be used.{{sfn|Hunnicutt|1984|page= 155 }} US built XM24/L52 barrels (length 218.5 inches)<ref >{{cite web|url=http://www.williammaloney.com/Aviation/WatervlietArsenalMuseum/TankCannon/pages/09M68_105mmGun.htm|title=09 M68 105mm Gun|website=www.williammaloney.com|access-date=2019-05-31|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180121075334/http://www.williammaloney.com/Aviation/WatervlietArsenalMuseum/TankCannon/pages/09M68_105mmGun.htm|archive-date=2018-01-21|url-status=live}}</ref> fitted with an eccentric bore evacuator were used for the M60-series starting in June 1959 but retained interchangeability with the British X15/L52 barrel.{{sfn|Hunnicutt|1984|page= 152 }} All of the US guns and XM24 barrels were produced at the [[Watervliet Arsenal]], NY and the gun mounts (M116 for the M60 and M140 for the M60A1/A3) manufactured at the [[Rock Island Arsenal]], IL.<ref >{{cite web |url= https://www.gao.gov/assets/190/188401.pdf|title=Procurement report |date=1976 |website= www.gao.gov|format=PDF|access-date=2020-04-11}}</ref> US M68 guns were fitted with an eccentric bore evacuator instead of a concentric model in order to provide more clearance over the rear deck of the tank.<ref name=\"Organizational Maintenance Manual--Tank 2306\">TM 9-2350-253-20-2 Organizational Maintenance Manual--Tank, Combat, Full Tracked: 105-mm Gun, M60A3 (2350-00-148-6548) and (2350-01-061-2306) TTS Turret.
