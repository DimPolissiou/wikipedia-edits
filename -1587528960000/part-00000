Waves suitable for surfing are primarily found in the [[ocean]], but can also be found in [[Lake surfing|lakes]] or [[River surfing|rivers]] in the form of a [[standing wave]] or [[tidal bore]]. However, surfers can also utilize artificial waves such as those from boat wakes and the waves created in artificial [[wave pool]]s.\n[[File:Mick Corbett at Cow Bombie.jpg|thumb|Mick Corbett at Cow Bombie]]\nThe term ''surfing'' refers to the act of riding a wave with a board, regardless of the stance used. There are several types of boards. The [[Polynesian culture|native peoples of the Pacific]], for instance, surfed waves on [[alaia]], paipo, and other such craft, and did so on their belly and knees. The modern-day definition of surfing, however, most often refers to a surfer riding a wave standing on a [[surfboard]]; this is also referred to as stand-up surfing.\n\nAnother prominent form of surfing is [[body boarding]], when a surfer rides the wave on a bodyboard, either lying on their belly, drop knee (one foot and one knee on the board), or sometimes even standing up on a body board. Other types of surfing include knee boarding, surf matting (riding inflatable mats), and using foils. [[Body surfing]], where the wave is surfed without a board, using the surfer's own body to catch and ride the wave, is very common and is considered by some to be the purest form of surfing. The closest form of body surfing using a board is a handboard which normally has one strap over it to fit one hand in.\n\nThree major subdivisions within stand-up surfing are [[Standup paddleboarding|stand-up paddling]], [[Surfboard#Long board|long boarding]] and [[Surfboard#Short board|short boarding]] with several major differences including the board design and length, the riding style, and the kind of wave that is ridden.\n\nIn [[tow-in surfing]] (most often, but not exclusively, associated with [[big wave surfing]]), a motorized water vehicle such as a [[personal watercraft]], tows the surfer into the wave front helping the surfer match a large wave's speed, which is generally a higher speed than a self-propelled surfer can produce. Surfing-related sports such as [[paddle boarding]] and [[sea kayaking]] do not require waves, and other derivative sports such as [[kite surfing]] and [[windsurfing]] rely primarily on wind for power, yet all of these platforms may also be used to ride waves. Recently with the use of [[V-drive]] boats, [[Wakesurfing]], in which one surfs on the wake of a boat, has emerged. The [[Guinness Book of World Records]] recognized a {{convert|78|ft|m|order=flip|abbr=on|sigfig=3}} wave ride by [[Garrett McNamara]] at [[Nazar\u00e9, Portugal|Nazar\u00e9]], [[Portugal]] as the largest wave ever surfed.<ref>{{cite news|title=Surfer rides World Record 24 m (78 ft) wave|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-us-canada-18036392|work=BBC News|accessdate=29 January 2013|date=12 May 2012}}</ref>\n\n==Origins and history==\n{{Main|History of surfing}}\n{{See also|Surfing in the United States}}\n\nFor hundreds of years, surfing was a central part of ancient [[Polynesian culture]]. Surfing may have first been observed by British explorers at [[Tahiti]] in 1767. [[Samuel Wallis]] and the crew members of {{HMS|Dolphin|1751|6}} were the first Britons to visit the island in June of that year. Another candidate is the botanist [[Joseph Banks]]<ref>Fleming, F. (c. 2005). ''Off the Map: Tales of Endurance and Exploration'', p. 154. Atlantic Monthly Press.</ref> being part of the [[first voyage of James Cook]] on {{HMS|Endeavour}}, who arrived on Tahiti on 10 April 1769. Lieutenant [[James King (Royal Navy officer)|James King]] was the first person to write about the art of surfing on [[Hawaii]] when he was completing the journals of Captain [[James Cook]] upon Cook's death in 1779.\n\nWhen [[Mark Twain]] visited Hawaii in 1866 he wrote,\n<blockquote>In one place we came upon a large company of naked natives, of both sexes and all ages, amusing themselves with the national pastime of surf-bathing.<ref>{{cite book |last=Twain |first=Mark |title=Roughing It |year=2007 |publisher=Digireads.com Publishing |location=Lawrence, Kansas |isbn=9781420930283 |page=264 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=gjUOvGeK51MC}}</ref></blockquote>\n\nReferences to surf riding on planks and single canoe hulls are also verified for pre-contact [[Samoa]], where surfing was called ''fa'ase'e'' or ''se'egalu'' (see Augustin Kr\u00e4mer, ''The Samoa Islands''<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=LHyUEUwaUdAC|title=The Samoa Islands|accessdate=8 November 2014|isbn=9780824822194|last1=Kr\u00e4mer|first1=Augustin|year=2000}}</ref>), and [[Tonga]], far pre-dating the practice of surfing by Hawaiians and eastern Polynesians by over a thousand years.\n\nIn July 1885, three [https://santacruzmah.org/2015/the-birth-of-surf-city-july-3-october-25-2015/ teenage Hawaiian princes] took a break from their boarding school, St. Mathew's Hall in San Mateo, and came to cool off in Santa Cruz, California. There, [[David Kaw\u0101nanakoa]], [[Edward Abnel Keli\u02bbiahonui|Edward Keli\u02bbiahonui]] and [[Jonah K\u016bhi\u014d Kalaniana\u02bbole]] surfed the mouth of the San Lorenzo River on custom-shaped redwood boards, according to surf historians Kim Stoner and Geoff Dunn.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Dunn |first1=Geoffrey |title=Riders of the Sea Spray |url=http://www.gtweekly.com/santa-cruz-news/good-times-cover-stories/936-riders-of-the-sea-spray.html |accessdate=2020-04-01 |work=[[Good Times (newspaper)|Good Times]] |date=31 March 2010 |archiveurl=https://archive.today/20130103121552/http://www.gtweekly.com/santa-cruz-news/good-times-cover-stories/936-riders-of-the-sea-spray.html |archivedate=2013-01-03 |url-status=dead}}</ref>{{cbignore|bot=InternetArchiveBot}} In 1890 the pioneer in agricultural education [[John Wrightson]] reputedly became the first British surfer when instructed by two Hawaiian students at his college.<ref name=Times>[https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/britains-original-beach-boys-3kjh2vj7l7q Britain\u2019s original beach boys - ''[[The Times]]'' 9 April 2012]</ref><ref>[https://www.museumofbritishsurfing.org.uk/ Hawaiian Royals Surf Bridlington \u2013 in 1890! - Museum of British Surfing]</ref><ref>Malcolm Gault-Williams, [https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=r84MBAAAQBAJ&pg=PA255&lpg=PA255&dq Legendary Surfers: The 1930s''],  Volume 3, Lulu (2012) - [[Google Books]] pg. 255]</ref>\n\n[[George Freeth]] (8 November 1883 \u2013 7 April 1919) is often credited as being the \"Father of Modern Surfing\". He is thought to have been the first modern surfer.\n\nIn 1907, the eclectic interests of the [[land baron]] [[Henry E. Huntington]] brought the ancient art of surfing to the California coast. While on vacation, Huntington had seen Hawaiian boys surfing the island waves. Looking for a way to entice visitors to the area of [[Redondo Beach, California|Redondo Beach]], where he had heavily invested in real estate, he hired a young Hawaiian to ride surfboards. George Freeth decided to revive the art of surfing, but had little success with the huge {{convert|16|ft|cm|order=flip|abbr=on|round=50}} hardwood boards that were popular at that time. When he cut them in half to make them more manageable, he created the original \"Long board\", which made him the talk of the islands. To the delight of visitors, Freeth exhibited his surfing skills twice a day in front of the [[Hotel Redondo]]. Another native Hawaiian, [[Duke Kahanamoku]], spread surfing to both the U.S. and Australia, riding the waves after displaying the swimming prowess that won him Olympic gold medals in 1912 and 1920.\n\nIn 1975, a professional tour started.<ref name=\"Woman of the Year\">{{cite web | title=Woman of the Year | website=Surfing Walk of Fame | url=http://www.surfingwalkoffame.com/woman/Oberg.html | access-date=11 December 2017 | url-status=dead | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170806224253/http://www.surfingwalkoffame.com/woman/Oberg.html | archive-date=6 August 2017 | df=dmy-all }}</ref> That year [[Margo Oberg]] became the first female professional surfer.<ref name=\"Woman of the Year\"/>\n\n==Surf waves==\n<!-- [[Surf wave]] redirects here -->\n{{See also|Ocean surface wave}}\n[[File:Pipeline Barrel (51633882).jpeg|thumb|Pipeline Barrel at [[P\u016bp\u016bkea, Hawaii]]]]\n[[File:A surfer surfing on the ocean (Unsplash).jpg|thumb|Surfer getting tubed at [[Sunset Beach (Oahu)|Sunset]] on the [[North Shore (Oahu)|North Shore]] of [[Oahu]]]]\n[[File:Surfers at Mavericks.jpg|thumb|right|A large wave breaking at Mavericks]]\n\n[[Swell (ocean)|Swell]] is generated when the wind blows consistently over a large area of open water, called the wind's [[fetch (geography)|fetch]]. The size of a swell is determined by the strength of the wind and the length of its fetch and duration. Because of this, the surf tends to be larger and more prevalent on coastlines exposed to large expanses of ocean traversed by intense [[low-pressure area|low pressure systems]].\n\nLocal wind conditions affect wave quality since the surface of a wave can become choppy in blustery conditions. Ideal conditions include a light to moderate \"offshore\" wind, because it blows into the front of the wave, making it a [[Barreling wave|\"barrel\"]] or \"tube\" wave. Waves are Left handed and Right Handed depending upon the breaking formation of the wave.\n\nWaves are generally recognized by the surfaces over which they break.<ref>The Bluffer's Guides, The Bluffer's Guide to Surfing, Oval Books, 2008.</ref> For example, there are beach breaks, reef breaks and point breaks.\n\nThe most important influence on wave shape is the [[bathymetry|topography of the seabed]] directly behind and immediately beneath the breaking wave. The contours of the [[reef]] or bar front become stretched by [[diffraction]]. Each break is different since each location's underwater topography is unique. At beach breaks, sandbanks change shape from week to week. [[Surf forecasting]] is aided by advances in information technology. Mathematical modeling graphically depicts the size and direction of swells around the globe.\n\nSwell regularity varies across the globe and throughout the year. During winter, heavy swells are generated in the mid-latitudes, when the North and South [[polar front]]s shift toward the [[Equator]]. The predominantly Westerly winds generate swells that advance Eastward, so waves tend to be largest on West coasts during winter months. However, an endless train of [[mid-latitude cyclone]]s cause the [[isobar (meteorology)|isobar]]s to become undulated, redirecting swells at regular intervals toward the tropics.<!-- what is an undulated isobar? -->\n\nEast coasts also receive heavy winter swells when low-pressure cells form in the sub-tropics, where slow moving [[anti-cyclone|highs]] inhibit their movement. These lows produce a shorter fetch than polar fronts, however, they can still generate heavy swells since their slower movement increases the duration of a particular wind direction. The variables of fetch and duration both influence how long wind acts over a wave as it travels since a wave reaching the end of a fetch behaves as if the wind died.\n\nDuring summer, heavy swells are generated when cyclones form in the tropics. [[Tropical cyclone]]s form over warm seas, so their occurrence is influenced by [[El Ni\u00f1o-Southern Oscillation|El Ni\u00f1o & La Ni\u00f1a]] cycles. Their movements are unpredictable.\n\nSurf travel and some surf camps offer surfers access to remote, tropical locations, where [[tradewinds]] ensure offshore conditions. Since winter swells are generated by [[mid-latitude cyclone]]s, their regularity coincides with the passage of these lows. Swells arrive in pulses, each lasting for a couple of days, with a few days between each swell.\n\nThe availability of free [[Numerical weather prediction|model data]] from the [[NOAA]] has allowed the creation of several [[surf forecasting]] websites.\n\n===Wave intensity===\n[[File:Wave-shape-intensity.svg|thumb|upright=1.35|The [[geometry]] of tube shape can be represented as a ratio between length and width.]]\n\nTube shape is defined by length to width ratio.

Artificial surfing reefs can be built with durable sandbags or concrete, and resemble a submerged breakwater. These artificial reefs not only provide a surfing location, but also dissipate wave energy and shelter the coastline from erosion. Ships such as [[Seli 1]] that have accidentally stranded on sandy bottoms, can create sandbanks that give rise to good waves.<ref>{{cite web|title=Seli 1: One Year On|url=http://www.zigzag.co.za/news/enviro/6709/Seli-1|work=ZigZag|publisher=Online Publishers Association South Africa|accessdate=25 May 2012|author=Clayton Truscott|date=23 September 2009}}</ref>\n\nAn artificial reef known as [[Chevron Reef]] was constructed in [[El Segundo, California]] in hopes of creating a new surfing area. However, the reef failed to produce any quality waves and was removed in 2008. In [[Kovalam]], South West India, an artificial reef has, however, successfully provided the local community with a quality lefthander, stabilized coastal soil erosion, and provided good habitat for [[marine life]].<ref>{{cite news|title=India's first artificial reef to protect Kovalam|url=http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/Indias-first-artificial-reef-to-protect-Kovalam/articleshow/5951403.cms|accessdate=25 May 2012|newspaper=The Times Of India|date=20 May 2010|author=TNN}}</ref> ASR Ltd., a New Zealand-based company, constructed the Kovalam reef and is working on [[Boscombe Surf Reef|another reef]] in Boscombe, England.\n\n==Artificial waves==\n[[File:Surf IMG 0949 (3120282731).jpg|thumb|upright=0.8|Surfing a stationary, artificial wave in Southern California]]\n\nEven with artificial reefs in place, a tourist's vacation time may coincide with a \"flat spell\", when no waves are available. Completely artificial [[Wave pool]]s aim to solve that problem by controlling all the elements that go into creating perfect surf, however there are only a handful of wave pools that can [[simulate]] good surfing waves, owing primarily to construction and operation costs and potential liability. Most wave pools generate waves that are too small and lack the power necessary to surf. The [[Seagaia Ocean Dome]], located in Miyazaki, Japan, was an example of a surfable wave pool. Able to generate waves with up to {{convert|3|m|ft||abbr=on|sigfig=1}} faces, the specialized pump held water in 20 vertical tanks positioned along the back edge of the pool. This allowed the waves to be directed as they approach the artificial sea floor. Lefts, Rights, and A-frames could be directed from this pump design providing for rippable surf and barrel rides. The Ocean Dome cost about $2&nbsp;billion to build and was expensive to maintain.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.surfline.com/mag/pulse/2000/nov/11_8_japan.cfm|title=MADE IN JAPAN Unlike its counterparts, Miyazaki's Ocean Dome wavepool is for real|author=Duncan Scott|date=8 November 2000|work=Surfline|publisher=Surfline/Wavetrak, Inc|accessdate=25 May 2012}}</ref> The Ocean Dome was closed in 2007. In England, construction is nearing completion on the Wave,<ref name=\"the-wave\">{{cite web | title=Sustainable inland surfing destinations | website=The Wave Bristol | url=http://thewave.com/Bristol/ | access-date=11 December 2017}}</ref> situated near [[Bristol]], which will enable people unable to get to the coast to enjoy the waves in a controlled environment, set in the heart of nature.\n\nThere are two main types of artificial waves that exist today. One being artificial or stationary waves which simulate a moving, breaking wave by pumping a layer of water against a smooth structure mimicking the shape of a breaking wave. Because of the velocity of the rushing water the wave and the surfer can remain stationary while the water rushes by under the surfboard. Artificial waves of this kind provide the opportunity to try surfing and learn its basics in a moderately small and controlled environment near or far from locations with natural surf.\n\nAnother artificial wave can be made through use of a [[wave pool]]. These wave pools strive to make a wave that replicates a real ocean wave more than the stationary wave does. In 2018, the first professional surfing tournament in a wave pool was held.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Rose|first1=Brent|title=Is The First Pro Surfing Contest In A Wave Pool The Sport's Future, Or Its Bastardization?|url=https://deadspin.com/is-the-first-pro-surfing-contest-in-a-wave-pool-the-spo-1825848433#o6hi39el133n3an9yqmdatt1w.2sp2nmrdrwe13|accessdate=11 May 2018|work=[[Deadspin]]|date=10 May 2018}}</ref>\n\n==Surfers and surf culture==\n{{Main|Surf culture}}\n[[File:Shaka-sign.png|left|The [[Shaka sign]]|thumb|alt=Photo of back of human wrist and hand. The thumb and pinkie are extended and the other fingers are folded against the palm.]]\n\nSurfers represent a diverse [[surf culture|culture]] based on riding the waves. Some people practice surfing as a [[recreation]]al activity while others make it the central focus of their lives. Surfing culture is most dominant in [[Hawaii]] and [[California]] because these two states offer the best surfing conditions. However, waves can be found wherever there is coastline, and a tight-knit yet far-reaching subculture of surfers has emerged throughout America. Some historical markers of the culture included the [[woodie (car body style)|woodie]], the station wagon used to carry surfers' boards, as well as [[boardshorts]], the long swim shorts typically worn while surfing. Surfers also wear wetsuits in colder regions.\n\nThe sport is also a significant part of [[Australia]]'s eastern coast sub-cultural life <ref>[http://www.thearkatech.com/liam-hemsworth/6346/ Liam Hemsworth leaves 2019 with surfboard]</ref>, especially in [[New South Wales]], where the weather and water conditions are most favourable for surfing.\n\nDuring the 1960s, as surfing caught on in California, its popularity spread through American pop culture. Several teen movies, starting with the [[Gidget]] series in 1959, transformed surfing into a dream life for American youth. Later movies, including [[Beach Party]] (1963), [[Ride the Wild Surf]] (1964), and [[Beach Blanket Bingo]] (1965) promoted the California dream of sun and surf.  Surf culture also fueled the early records of the [[Beach Boys]].\n\nThe sport of surfing now represents a multibillion-dollar industry especially in [[Surf culture#Fashion|clothing and fashion]] markets. [[World Surf League|The World Surf League (WSL)]] runs the championship tour, hosting top competitors in some of the best surf spots around the globe. A small number of people make a career out of surfing by receiving corporate sponsorships and performing for photographers and videographers in far-flung destinations; they are typically referred to as freesurfers. Sixty-six surfboarders on a {{convert|42|ft|m|order=flip|abbr=on|sigfig=2}} long surfboard set a record in [[Huntington Beach, California]] for most people on a surfboard at one time. [[Dale Webster]] consecutively surfed for 14,641 days, making it his main life focus.\n\nWhen the waves were flat, surfers persevered with [[skateboarding|sidewalk surfing]], which is now called skateboarding. Sidewalk surfing has a similar feel to surfing and requires only a paved road or sidewalk. To create the feel of the wave, surfers even sneak into empty backyard swimming pools to ride in, known as pool skating. Eventually, surfing made its way to the slopes with the invention of the [[Snurfer]], later credited as the first snowboard. Many other board sports have been invented over the years, but all can trace their heritage back to surfing.\n\nMany surfers claim to have a spiritual connection with the ocean, describing surfing, the surfing experience, both in and out of the water, as a type of spiritual experience or a religion.<ref name=\"huffingtonpost\">{{cite web|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/08/03/religion-of-surfing_n_5617472.html|title=The Spirituality Of Surfing: Finding Religion Riding The Waves|publisher=huffingtonpost.com|accessdate=26 August 2015|date=3 August 2014}}</ref>\n\n==Maneuvers==\n[[File:Mavericks and surfer.jpg|A surfer at [[Mavericks (location)|Mavericks]]|thumb]]\n[[File:Big wave breaking in Santa Cruz.jpg|right|thumb|A surfer going for the tube|alt=Photo of surfer at bottom of wave, attempting to let tube envelop him]]\n[[File:Surfing contest - oahu hawaii - north shore - oct 2015.ogv|thumb|thumbtime=6|right|Catching waves at a surfing contest on the [[North Shore (Oahu)|North Shore]] of [[Oahu]], [[Hawaii]]]]\n\nStandup surfing begins when the surfer paddles toward shore in an attempt to match the speed of the wave (the same applies whether the surfer is standup paddling, bodysurfing, boogie-boarding or using some other type of watercraft, such as a waveski or kayak). Once the wave begins to carry the surfer forward, the surfer stands up and proceeds to ride the wave. The basic idea is to position the surfboard so it is just ahead of the breaking part (whitewash) of the wave. A common problem for beginners is being able to catch the wave at all.\n\nSurfers' skills are tested by their ability to control their board in difficult conditions, riding challenging waves, and executing maneuvers such as strong turns and cutbacks (turning board back to the breaking wave) and ''carving'' (a series of strong back-to-back maneuvers). More advanced skills include the ''floater'' (riding on top of the breaking curl of the wave), and ''off the lip'' (banking off the breaking wave). A newer addition to surfing is the progression of the ''air'' whereby a surfer propels off the wave entirely up into the air, and then successfully lands the board back on the wave.\n\nThe tube ride is considered to be the ultimate maneuver in surfing. As a wave breaks, if the conditions are ideal, the wave will break in an orderly line from the middle to the shoulder, enabling the experienced surfer to position themselves inside the wave as it is breaking. This is known as a tube ride. Viewed from the shore, the tube rider may disappear from view as the wave breaks over the rider's head. The longer the surfer remains in the tube, the more successful the ride. This is referred to as getting tubed, barrelled, shacked or pitted. Some of the world's best known waves for tube riding include Pipeline on the North shore of Oahu, Teahupoo in Tahiti and G-Land in Java. Other names for the tube include \"the barrel\", and \"the pit\".\n\n[[Hanging ten]] and hanging five are moves usually specific to long boarding. Hanging Ten refers to having both feet on the front end of the board with all of the surfer's toes off the edge, also known as nose-riding. Hanging Five is having just one foot near the front, with five toes off the edge.\n\nCutback: Generating speed down the line and then turning back to reverse direction.\n\nFloater: Suspending the board atop the wave. Very popular on small waves.\n\nTop-Turn: Turn off the top of the wave. Sometimes used to generate speed and sometimes to shoot spray.\n\nAirs/Aerials: These maneuvers have been becoming more and more prevalent in the sport in both competition and free surfing. An air is when the surfer can achieve enough speed and approach a certain type of section of a wave that is supposed to act as a ramp and launch the surfer above the lip line of the wave, \u201ccatching air\u201d, and landing either in the transition of the wave or the whitewash when hitting a close-out section.\n\nAirs can either be straight airs or rotational airs. Straight airs have minimal rotation if any, but definitely no more rotation than 90 degrees. Rotational airs require a rotation of 90 degrees or more depending on the level of the surfer.\n\nTypes of rotations:\n\n* 180 degrees \u2013 called an air reverse, this is when the surfer spins enough to land backwards, then reverts to their original positional with the help of the fins. This rotation can either be done frontside or backside, and can spin right or left.\n* 360 degrees \u2013 this is a full rotation air or \u201cfull rotor\u201d where the surfer lands where they started or more, as long as they do not land backwards. When this is achieved front side on a wave spinning the opposite of an air reverse is called an alley oop.\n* 540 degrees \u2013 the surfer does a full rotation plus another 180 degrees, and can be inverted or spinning straight, few surfers have been able to land this air.\n* Backflip \u2013 usually done with a double grab, this hard to land air is made for elite level surfers.\n* Rodeo flip \u2013 usually done backside, it is a backflip with a 180 rotation, and is actually easier than a straight backflip.\n* Grabs \u2013 a surfer can help land an aerial maneuver by grabbing the surfboard, keeping them attached to the board and keeping the board under their feet. Common types of grabs include:\n** Indy \u2013 a grab on the surfers (inside rail going frontside, outside rail going backside) with their back hand.\n** Slob \u2013 a grab on the surfers (inside rail going frontside, outside rail going backside) with their front hand.\n** Lien \u2013 A grab on the surfers (outside rail frontside, inside rail going backside) with their front hand.\n** Stalefish \u2013 A grab on the surfers (outside rail frontside, inside rail backside) with their back hand.\n** Double grab \u2013 A grab on the surfers inside and outside rail, the inside rail with the back hand and the outside rail with the front hand.\n\n===Terms===\nThe [[Glossary of surfing]] includes some of the extensive [[vocabulary]] used to describe various aspects of the sport of surfing as described in literature on the subject.<ref>{{cite book |last=Finney |first=Ben |author2=Houston, James D. |title=Surfing \u2013 A History of the Ancient Hawaiian Sport |publisher=Pomegranate Artbooks |location=Rohnett, CA |isbn=978-0-87654-594-2 |chapter=Appendix A \u2013 Hawaiian Surfing terms |pages=94\u201397 |year=1996}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |last=Guisado |first=Raul |title=The Art of Surfing: A Training Manual for the Developing and Competitive Surfer |publisher=Globe Pequot Press |location=Guilford, CT |year=2003 |chapter=Appendix A \u2013 Glossary of Surfing Lingo |pages=[https://archive.org/details/artofsurfingtrai0000guis/page/165 165\u20130170] |isbn=978-0-7627-2466-6 |url=https://archive.org/details/artofsurfingtrai0000guis/page/165 }}</ref> In some cases terms have spread to a wider cultural use. These terms were originally coined by people who were directly involved in the sport of surfing.\n\n==Learning==\nMany popular surfing destinations have surf schools and surf camps that offer lessons. Surf camps for beginners and intermediates are multi-day lessons that focus on surfing fundamentals. They are designed to take new surfers and help them become proficient riders. All-inclusive surf camps offer overnight accommodations, meals, lessons and surfboards. Most surf lessons begin with instruction and a safety briefing on land, followed by instructors helping students into waves on longboards or \"softboards\". The softboard is considered the ideal surfboard for learning, due to the fact it is safer, and has more paddling speed and stability than shorter boards. Funboards are also a popular shape for beginners as they combine the volume and stability of the longboard with the manageable size of a smaller surfboard.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://hvsboardsport.com/howtosurf/|title=How to surf; learn to surf in one day|author=Kristian Hansen|date=20 November 2017|website=hvsboardsport.com|publisher=Hvs Boardsport|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171201131256/https://hvsboardsport.com/howtosurf/|archive-date=1 December 2017|url-status=dead|access-date=20 November 2017}}</ref> New and inexperienced surfers typically learn to catch waves on softboards around the {{convert|7|to|8|ft|cm|order=flip|abbr=on|sigfig=2}} funboard size. Due to the softness of the surfboard the chance of getting injured is substantially minimized.\n\nTypical surfing instruction is best performed one-on-one, but can also be done in a group setting. The most popular surf locations offer perfect surfing conditions for beginners, as well as challenging breaks for advanced students. The ideal conditions for learning would be small waves that crumble and break softly, as opposed to the steep, fast-peeling waves desired by more experienced surfers. When available, a sandy seabed is generally safer.\n\nSurfing can be broken into several skills: Paddling strength, Positioning to catch the wave, timing, and balance. Paddling out requires strength, but also the mastery of techniques to break through oncoming waves (''duck diving'', ''eskimo roll''). Take-off positioning requires experience at predicting the wave set and where they will break. The surfer must pop up quickly as soon as the wave starts pushing the board forward. Preferred positioning on the wave is determined by experience at reading wave features including where the wave is breaking.<ref name=\"learnhowtosurf\">{{cite web |url=http://www.learnhowtosurf.info/how-to-surf/ |title=The quick guide on how to surf |publisher=learnhowtosurf.info |access-date=26 August 2015 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120831054300/http://www.learnhowtosurf.info/how-to-surf/ |archive-date=31 August 2012 |df=dmy-all }}</ref> Balance plays a crucial role in standing on a surfboard. Thus, balance training exercises are a good preparation. Practicing with a [[Balance board]] or swing boarding helps novices master the art.\n\nThe repetitive cycle of paddling, popping up, and balancing requires stamina, explosivity, and near-constant core stabilization. Having a proper warm up routine can help prevent injuries.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.menshealth.com/fitness/a19528572/torrey-meister-warm-up-us-open-surfing/|title=Warm Up So You Don't Wipe Out|date=2017-08-01|work=Men's Health|access-date=2018-11-13|language=en-US}}</ref>\n\n==Equipment==\n[[File:Waxing a surfboard.jpg|thumb|[[Surfboard wax|Waxing]] a surfboard|alt=Photo of woman bent over surfboard rubbing bar of solid wax against the board with palm trees and ocean in background]]\n[[File:Surf Leash.JPG|thumb|[[Surfboard leash]]|alt=Photo of plastic cord attached to surfboard and velcroed around surfer's ankle]]\n\nSurfing can be done on various equipment, including [[surfboard]]s, [[Longboard (surfing)|longboards]], [[Stand up paddle surfing|stand up paddle boards (SUPs)]], [[bodyboard]]s, [[Waveski|wave skis]], [[skimboard]]s, [[kneeboard]]s, surf mats and macca's trays. [[Surfboard]]s were originally made of solid wood and were large and heavy (often up to {{convert|12|ft|cm|order=flip|abbr=on|sigfig=2}} long and having a mass of {{convert|150|lb|kg|order=flip|abbr=on|sigfig=1}}). Lighter [[balsa wood]] surfboards (first made in the late 1940s and early 1950s) were a significant improvement, not only in portability, but also in increasing maneuverability.\n\nMost modern surfboards are made of [[fiberglass]] foam (PU), with one or more wooden strips or \"stringers\", fiberglass cloth, and [[polyester resin]] (PE). An emerging board material is [[epoxy resin]] and [[Polystyrene#Expanded polystyrene|Expanded Polystyrene]] foam (EPS) which is stronger and lighter than traditional PU/PE construction. Even newer designs incorporate materials such as [[carbon fiber]] and variable-flex composites in conjunction with fiberglass and epoxy or polyester resins. Since epoxy/EPS surfboards are generally lighter, they will float better than a traditional PU/PE board of similar size, shape and thickness. This makes them easier to paddle and faster in the water. However, a common complaint of EPS boards is that they do not provide as much feedback as a traditional PU/PE board. For this reason, many advanced surfers prefer that their surfboards be made from traditional materials.\n\nOther equipment includes a [[Surfboard leash|leash]] (to stop the board from drifting away after a wipeout, and to prevent it from hitting other surfers), [[surf wax]], traction pads (to keep a surfer's feet from slipping off the deck of the board), and fins (also known as ''skegs'') which can either be permanently attached (''glassed-on'') or interchangeable. [[Sportswear (activewear)|Sportswear]] designed or particularly suitable for surfing may be sold as ''boardwear'' (the term is also used in [[snowboarding]]). In warmer climates, swimsuits, surf trunks or [[boardshorts]] are worn, and occasionally [[rash guard]]s; in cold water surfers can opt to wear [[wetsuit]]s, boots, hoods, and gloves to protect them against lower water temperatures. A newer introduction is a rash vest with a thin layer of [[titanium]] to provide maximum warmth without compromising mobility. In recent years, there have been advancements in technology that have allowed surfers to pursue even bigger waves with added elements of safety. Big wave surfers are now experimenting with inflatable vests or colored dye packs to help decrease their odds of drowning.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Surfer|title=Bigger and Better|url=http://www.surfermag.com/features/big-wave-surfing-innovations/|accessdate=29 December 2014|work=Surfer Magazine|publisher=Surfer Magazine|date=15 September 2014|ref=http://www.surfermag.com/author/surfer/}}</ref>\n\n[[File:1999 - Surf \u00e0 Waikiki Beach Honolulu Hawa\u00ef.jpg|thumb|left|upright=1.2|Longboards at [[Waikiki beach]]|alt=Photo of dozens of surfboards on rack. Each board is perpendicular to the ground and parallel to the other boards. Ocean in background.]]\n\nThere are many different surfboard sizes, shapes, and designs in use today. Modern [[Surfboard#Variations|longboard]]s, generally {{convert|9|to|10|ft|cm|order=flip|abbr=on|sigfig=2}} in length, are reminiscent of the earliest surfboards, but now benefit from modern innovations in surfboard shaping and fin design. Competitive longboard surfers need to be competent at traditional ''walking'' manoeuvres, as well as the short-radius turns normally associated with shortboard surfing. The modern [[Surfboard#Variations|shortboard]] began life in the late 1960s and has evolved into today's common ''thruster'' style, defined by its three fins, usually around {{convert|6|to|7|ft|cm|order=flip|abbr=on|sigfig=2}} in length. The thruster was invented by Australian [[Surfboard shaper|shaper]] [[Simon Anderson]].\n\nMidsize boards, often called [[Surfboard#Variations|funboard]]s, provide more maneuverability than a longboard, with more flotation than a shortboard. While many surfers find that funboards live up to their name, providing the best of both surfing modes, others are critical.\n\n:\"It is the happy medium of mediocrity,\" writes Steven Kotler. \"Funboard riders either have nothing left to prove or lack the skills to prove anything.\"<ref>{{cite book\n  | last =Kotler\n  | first =Steven\n  | title =West of Jesus: Surfing, Science, and the Origins of Belief\n  | publisher =Bloomsbury\n  | date =13 June 2006\n  | isbn =978-1-59691-051-5 }}</ref>\n\nThere are also various niche styles, such as the ''Egg'', a longboard-style short board targeted for people who want to ride a shortboard but need more paddle power. The ''Fish'', a board which is typically shorter, flatter, and wider than a normal shortboard, often with a split tail (known as a ''swallow tail''). The Fish often has two or four [[Surfboard Fins|fins]] and is specifically designed for surfing smaller waves. For big waves there is the ''Gun'', a long, thick board with a pointed nose and tail (known as a pin tail) specifically designed for big waves.\n\n== The physics of surfing ==\n{{Multiple image\n|align=right |direction=vertical |width=240\n|image1=Nazar\u00e9, Portugal (Unsplash 7bt4ngmSu9Y).jpg |caption1=[[Tow-in surfing]] in [[Nazar\u00e9, Portugal]]\n|image2=Praia do Norte, Nazar\u00e9, Portugal (33830450815).jpg |caption2=Giant [[breaking wave]]s in [[Praia do Norte (Nazar\u00e9)|Praia do Norte]]\n|image3=Can you see the surfer?

Waves increase in energy and speed, and then become longer and stronger.<ref name=Scarfe2009 /> The fully developed sea has the strongest wave action that experiences storms lasting 10-hours and creates 15 meter wave heights  in the open ocean.<ref name=Talley2011 />\n\nThe waves created in the open ocean are classified as deep-water waves. Deep-water waves have no bottom interaction and the orbits of these water molecules are circular; their wavelength is short relative to water depth and the velocity decays before the reaching the bottom of the water basin.<ref name=Talley2011 /> Deep waves have depths greater than \u00bd their wavelengths. Wind forces waves to break in the deep sea.\n\nDeep-water waves travel to shore and become shallow water waves. Shallow water waves have depths less than \u00bd of their wavelength. Shallow wave's wavelengths are long relative to water depth and have elliptical orbitals. The wave velocity effects the entire water basin. The water interacts with the bottom as it approaches shore and has a drag interaction. The drag interaction pulls on the bottom of the wave, causes refraction, increases the height, decreases the celerity (or the speed of the wave form), and the top (crest) falls over. This phenomenon happens because the velocity of the top of the wave is greater than the velocity of the bottom of the wave.<ref name=Talley2011>{{cite book|last=Talley |first=Lynne D. |title=Descriptive Physical Oceanography: An Introduction |date=2011 |publisher=Academic Press |isbn=978-0-08-093911-7 |pages=223\u2013244 |chapter=Chapter 8. Gravity Waves, Tides, and Coastal Oceanography }}</ref>\n\nThe surf zone is place of convergence of multiple waves types creating complex wave patterns. A wave suitable for surfing results from maximum speeds of 5 meters per second. This speed is relative because local onshore winds can cause waves to break.<ref name=Scarfe2009 /> In the surf zone, shallow water waves are carried by global winds to the beach and interact with local winds to make surfing waves.<ref name=Scarfe2009 /><ref name=Madsen1997 />\n\nDifferent onshore and off-shore wind patterns in the surf zone create different types of waves. Onshore winds cause random wave breaking patterns and are more suitable for experienced surfers.<ref name=Scarfe2009 /><ref name=Madsen1997>{{cite journal |last1=Madsen |first1=P.A. |author2=O.R.

Thus, the breaker intensity (or force) increases, and the wave speed and height increase.<ref name=Scarfe2009 /> Off-shore winds produce non-surfable conditions by flattening a weak swell. Weak swell is made from surface gravity forces and has long wavelengths.<ref name=Scarfe2009 /><ref name=Edge2001>{{cite journal |last=Edge |first=Ronald |date=2001 |title=Surf Physics |journal=The Physics Teacher |volume=39 |issue=5 |pages=272\u2013277 |doi=10.1119/1.1375464|bibcode=2001PhTea..39..272E }}</ref>\n\n=== Wave conditions for surfing ===\nSurfing waves can be analyzed using the following parameters: breaking wave height, wave peel angle (\u03b1), wave breaking intensity, and wave section length. The breaking wave height has two measurements, the relative heights estimated by surfers and the exact measurements done by physical oceanographers. Measurements done by surfers were 1.36 to 2.58 times higher than the measurements done by scientists. The scientifically concluded wave heights that are physically possible to surf are 1 to 20 meters.<ref name=Scarfe2009 />\n\nThe wave peel angle is one of the main constituents of a potential surfing wave. Wave peel angle measures the distance between the peel-line and the line tangent to the breaking crest line. This angle controls the speed of the wave crest. The speed of the wave is an addition of the propagation velocity vector (Vw) and peel velocity vector (Vp), which results in the overall velocity of the wave (Vs).<ref name=Scarfe2009 />\n\nWave breaking intensity measures the force of the wave as it breaks, spills, or plunges (a plunging wave is termed by surfers as a \"barrel wave\"). Wave section length is the distance between two breaking crests in a wave set. Wave section length can be hard to measure because local winds, non-linear wave interactions, island sheltering, and swell interactions can cause multifarious wave configurations in the surf zone.<ref name=Scarfe2009 />\n\nThe parameters breaking wave height, wave peel angle (\u03b1), and wave breaking intensity, and wave section length are important because they are standardized by past oceanographers who researched surfing; these parameters have been used to create a guide that matches the type of wave formed and the skill level of surfer.<ref name=Scarfe2009>{{cite journal |last1=Scarfe |first1=Bradley E. |author2=Terry R.

Smaller wave peel angles increase the velocities of waves. A surfer must know how to react and paddle quickly to match the speed of the wave to catch it. Therefore, more experience is required to catch a low peel angle waves. More experienced surfers can handle longer section lengths, increased velocities, and higher wave heights.<ref name=Scarfe2009 /> Different locations offer different types of surfing conditions for each skill level.\n\n=== Surf breaks ===\nA [[surf break]] is an area with an obstruction or an object that causes a wave to break. Surf breaks entail multiple scale phenomena. Wave section creation has micro-scale factors of peel angle and wave breaking intensity. The micro-scale components influence wave height and variations on wave crests. The mesoscale components of surf breaks are the ramp, platform, wedge, or ledge that may be present at a surf break. Macro-scale processes are the global winds that initially produce offshore waves. Types of surf breaks are headlands (point break), beach break, river/estuary entrance bar, reef breaks, and ledge breaks.<ref name=Scarfe2009 />\n\n==== Headland (point break) ====\nA [[headland]] or point break interacts with the water by causing refraction around the point or headland. The point absorbs the high frequency waves and long period waves persist, which are easier to surf. Examples of locations that have headland or point break induced surf breaks are Dunedin (New Zealand), Raglan, Malibu (California), Rincon (California), and Kirra (Australia).<ref name=Scarfe2009 />\n\n==== Beach break ====\nA beach break happens where waves break from offshore waves, and onshore sandbars and rips. Wave breaks happen successively at beach breaks. Example locations are Tairua and Aramoana Beach (New Zealand) and the Gold Coast (Australia).<ref name=Scarfe2009 />\n\n==== River or estuary entrance bar ====\nA river or estuary entrance bar creates waves from the ebb tidal delta, sediment outflow, and tidal currents. An ideal estuary entrance bar exists in Whangamata Bar, New Zealand.<ref name=Scarfe2009 />\n\n==== Reef break ====\nA reef break is conducive to surfing because large waves consistently break over the reef. The reef is usually made of coral, and because of this, many injuries occur while surfing reef breaks. However, the waves that are produced by reef breaks are some of the best in the world. Famous reef breaks are present in Padang Padang (Indonesia), Pipeline (Hawaii), Uluwatu (Bali), and Teahupo'o (Tahiti).<ref name=Scarfe2009 /><ref>{{cite web|last1=HURT|first1=GAREK|title=THE DIFFERENCES BETWEEN BEACH BREAKS, POINT BREAKS, AND REEF BREAKS|url=https://www.degree33surfboards.com/blogs/gettin-pitted/14071029-the-differences-between-beach-breaks-point-breaks-and-reef-breaks|website=Degree 33 Surfboards|accessdate=26 November 2017}}</ref> When surfing a reef break, the depth of the water needs to be considered as surfboards have fins on the bottom of the board. \n\n==== Ledge break ====\nA ledge break is formed by steep rocks ledges that makes intense waves because the waves travel through deeper water then abruptly reach shallower water at the ledge. Shark Island, Australia is a location with a ledge break. Ledge breaks create difficult surfing conditions, sometimes only allowing body surfing as the only feasible way to confront the waves.<ref name=Scarfe2009 />\n\n=== Jetties and their impacts on wave formation in the surf zone ===\n[[Jetty|Jetties]] are added to bodies of water to regulate erosion, preserve navigation channels, and make harbors. Jetties are classified into four different types and have two main controlling variables: the type of delta and the size of the jetty.<ref name=Scarfe2003>{{cite journal |last1= Scarfe |first1=B.E. |author2=M.H.S. Elwany, K.P. Black, and S.T. Mead |title=Categorizing the Types of Surfing Breaks around Jetty Structures |url=http://escholarship.org/uc/item/09f405bq |journal=Scripps Institution of Oceanography Technical Report |date=7 March 2003 |pages=1\u20138}}</ref>\n\n==== Type 1 jetty ====\nThe first classification is a type 1 jetty. This type of jetty is significantly longer than the surf zone width and the waves break at the shore end of the jetty. The effect of a Type 1 jetty is sediment accumulation in a wedge formation on the jetty. These waves are large and increase in size as they pass over the sediment wedge formation. An example of a Type 1 jetty is Mission Beach, San Diego, California. This 1000-meter jetty was installed in 1950 at the mouth of Mission Bay. The surf waves happen north of the jetty, are longer waves, and are powerful. The bathymetry of the sea bottom in Mission Bay has a wedge shape formation that causes the waves to refract as they become closer to the jetty.<ref name=Scarfe2003 /> The waves converge constructively after they refract and increase the sizes of the waves.\n\n==== Type 2 jetty ====\nA type 2 jetty occurs in an ebb tidal delta, a delta transitioning between high and low tide. This area has shallow water, refraction, and a distinctive seabed shapes that creates large wave heights.<ref name=Scarfe2003 />\n\nAn example of a type 2 jetty is called \"The Poles\" in Atlantic Beach, Florida. Atlantic Beach is known to have flat waves, with exceptions during major storms. However, \"The Poles\" has larger than normal waves due to a 500-meter jetty that was installed on the south side of the St. Johns. This jetty was built to make a deep channel in the river. It formed a delta at \"The Poles\". This is special area because the jetty increases wave size for surfing, when comparing pre-conditions and post-conditions of the southern St. Johns River mouth area.<ref name=Scarfe2003 />\n\nThe wave size at \"The Poles\" depends on the direction of the incoming water. When easterly waters (from 55\u00b0) interact with the jetty, they create waves larger than southern waters (from 100\u00b0). When southern waves (from 100\u00b0) move toward \"The Poles\", one of the waves breaks north of the southern jetty and the other breaks south of the jetty. This does not allow for merging to make larger waves. Easterly waves, from 55\u00b0, converge north of the jetty and unite to make bigger waves.<ref name=Scarfe2003 />\n\n==== Type 3 jetty ====\nA type 3 jetty is in an ebb tidal area with an unchanging seabed that has naturally created waves. Examples of a Type 3 jetty occurs in \u201cSouthside\u201d Tamarack, Carlsbad, California.<ref name=Scarfe2003 />\n\n==== Type 4 jetty ====\nA type 4 jetty is one that no longer functions nor traps sediment. The waves are created from  reefs in the surf zone. A type 4 jetty can be found in Tamarack, Carlsbad, California.<ref name=Scarfe2003 />\n\n=== Rip currents ===\n[[Rip current]]s are fast, narrow currents that are caused by onshore transport within the surf zone and the successive return of the water seaward.<ref name=Dalrymple1978 /><ref name=Smith1995 />  The wedge bathymetry makes a convenient and consistent rip current of 5\u201310 meters that brings the surfers to the \u201ctake off point\u201d then out to the beach.<ref name=Scarfe2003 />\n\nOceanographers have two theories on rip current formation. The wave interaction model assumes that two edges of waves interact, create differing wave heights, and cause longshore transport of nearshore currents. The Boundary Interaction Model assumes that the topography of the sea bottom causes nearshore circulation and longshore transport; the result of both models is a rip current.<ref name=Dalrymple1978>{{cite journal |last=Dalrymple |first=Robert A. |date=1978 |title=Rip Currents and Their Causes |url=https://journals.tdl.org/icce/index.php/icce/article/viewArticle/3345 |journal=Coastal Engineering |volume=1 |issue=16 |pages=1414\u20131427}}</ref>\n\nRip currents can be extremely strong and narrow as they extend out of the surf zone into deeper water, reaching speeds from {{convert|0.5|m/s|ft/s||abbr=on|sigfig=2}} and up to {{convert|2.5|m/s|ft/s||abbr=on|sigfig=2}},<ref name=Smith1995 /><ref name=Bowen1969 /> which is faster than any human can swim. The water in the jet is sediment rich, bubble rich, and moves rapidly.<ref name=Smith1995 /> The rip head of the rip current has long shore movement.

Longer boards are good for beginners who need help balancing. Smaller boards are good for more experienced surfers who want to have more control and maneuverability.<ref name=Edge2001 />\n\nWhen practicing the sport of surfing, the surfer paddles out past the wave break to wait for a wave. When a surfable wave arrives, the surfer must paddle extremely fast to match the velocity of the wave so the wave can accelerate him or her.<ref name=Edge2001 />\n\nWhen the surfer is at wave speed, the surfer must quickly pop up, stay low, and stay toward the front of the wave to become stable and prevent falling as the wave steepens. The acceleration is less toward the front than toward the back. The physics behind the surfing of the wave involves the horizontal acceleration force (F\u00b7sin\u03b8) and the vertical force (F\u00b7cos\u03b8=mg). Therefore, the surfer should lean forward to gain speed, and lean on the back foot to brake.

Under the wrong circumstances these currents can endanger both experienced and inexperienced surfers. Since a rip current appears to be an area of flat water, tired or inexperienced swimmers or surfers may enter one and be carried out beyond the breaking waves. Although many rip currents are much smaller, the largest rip currents have a width of forty or fifty feet. However, by paddling parallel to the shore, a surfer can easily exit a rip current. Alternatively, some surfers actually ride on a rip current because it is a fast and effortless way to get out beyond the zone of breaking waves.<ref>\n{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/1530767.stm | work=BBC News | title=Surfing's hidden dangers | date=7 September 2001 | accessdate=24 May 2010}}</ref>\n\n===Seabed===\nThe [[seabed]] can pose a risk for surfers. If a surfer falls while riding a wave, the wave tosses and tumbles the surfer around, often in a downwards direction. At reef breaks and beach breaks, surfers have been seriously injured and even killed, because of a violent collision with the sea bed, the water above which can sometimes be very shallow, especially at beach breaks or reef breaks during low tide. Cyclops, [[Western Australia]], for example, is one of the biggest and thickest reef breaks in the world, with waves measuring up to {{convert|10|m|ft|abbr=on|sigfig=2}} high, but the [[reef]] below is only about {{convert|2|m|ft|abbr=on|sigfig=1}} below the surface of the water.\n\n===Microorganisms===\n{{Wikinews|British surfers catch more than waves: Scientists find antibiotic-resistant bacteria}}\nA January 2018 study by the [[University of Exeter]] called the \"Beach Bum Survey\" found surfers and bodyboarders to be three times as likely as non-surfers to harbor [[antibiotic-resistant]] ''[[E. coli]]'' and four times as likely to harbor other bacteria capable of easily becoming antibiotic resistant.

Surfer's ear is where the bone near the ear canal grows after repeated exposure to cold water, making the ear canal narrower. The narrowed canal makes it harder for water to drain from the ear. This can result in pain, infection and sometimes ringing of the ear. If surfer's ear develops it does so after repeated surfing sessions. Yet, damage such as inflammation of the ear can occur after only surfing once. This can be caused by repeatedly falling off the surfboard into the water and having the cold water rush into the ears, which can exert a damaging amount of pressure. Those with sensitive ears should therefore wear ear protection, even if they are not planning to surf very often.<ref>\n{{cite news| url=https://magicseaweed.com/news/surfers-ear-an-inconvenient-truth/6276/| work=MSW | title=Surfer's Ear \u2013 An Inconvenient Truth | date=4 April 2014 | accessdate=15 July 2018}}</ref>\n\nEar plugs designed for surfers, swimmers and other water athletes are primarily made to keep water out of the ear, thereby letting a protective pocket of air stay inside the ear canal. They can also block cold air, dirt and bacteria. Many designs are made to let sound through, and either float and/or have a leash in case the plug accidentally gets bumped out.<ref>[https://www.surfertoday.com/surfing/the-best-ear-plugs-for-surfers SurferToday.com | The Ultimate Surfing News Website | The best ear plugs for surfers]</ref><ref>[https://www.overthedune.com/wear-ear-plugs-when-surf/  Wear earplugs when you surf - Over The Dune | Get Surfing]</ref>\n\n=== Eye damage ===\n[[File:Seal Swim Goggles.jpg|thumb|right|SealMask watersport [[goggles]] made by AquaSphere]]\n[[Surfer's eye]] (''Pterygium (conjunctiva)'') is a gradual tissue growth on the cornea of the eye which ultimately can lead to vision loss. The cause of the condition is unclear, but appears to be partly related to long term exposure to UV light, dust and wind exposure. Prevention may include wearing sunglasses and a hat if in an area with strong sunlight. Surfers and other water-sport athletes should therefore wear eye protection that blocks 100% of the UV rays from the water, as is often used by snow-sport athletes. Surf goggles often have a head strap and ventilation to avoid fogging<ref>[http://www.wearsurfglasses.com/ Sunglasses for Surfing and other Water Sports]</ref><ref>[https://www.sportviz.co.uk/surf_cores Sportviz Custom Affordable Surf Masks]</ref>\n\nUsers of contact lenses should take extra care, and may consider wearing surfing goggles. Some risks of exposing contact lenses to the elements that can cause eye damage or infections are sand or organisms in the sea water getting between the eye and contact lens, or that lenses might fold.<ref>[https://www.surferdad.co.uk/surf-goggles Surfer Dad | Surf blog - Surf Goggles]</ref><ref>[http://mellow-waves.com/should-you-surf-with-contact-lenses/ Should you surf with contact lenses? | Mellow Waves]</ref>\n\n=== Spinal cord ===\n[[Surfer's myelopathy]] is a rare spinal cord injury causing paralysis of the lower extremities, caused by hyperextension of the back. This is due to one of the main blood vessels of the spine becoming kinked, depriving the spinal cord of oxygen. In some cases the paralysis is permanent. Although any activity where the back is arched can cause this condition (i.e. yoga, pilates, etc.), this rare phenomenon has most often been seen in those surfing for the first time. According to [[Doctor of Physical Therapy|DPT]] Sergio Florian, some recommendations for preventing myelopathy is proper warm up, limiting the session length and sitting on the board while waiting for waves, rather than lying.<ref>[https://magicseaweed.com/news/beginner-surfer-left-paralysed-after-suffering-rare-surfers-myelopathy/9263/ Beginner Surfer Left Paralysed after Suffering Rare Surfer's Myelopathy - Magicseaweed.com]</ref>\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery mode=\"packed\" height=\"160\"> \nFile:Surfing 33 2007.jpg|Beginner surfer in Pacific Beach, California\nFile:Surfing 6 2008.jpg|Surfer in Pacific Beach, California\nFile:Surfing 3 2007.jpg|A day of big surf in La Jolla, California\nFile:Surf IMG 0442-1 (3119237302).jpg|Big surf in La Jolla, California\nFile:Surf IMG 8762 (3120236985).jpg|Very big surf in La Jolla, California\nFile:Surfing 45 2007.jpg|Oops, La Jolla, California\n\n</gallery>\n\n==See also==\n{{Div col}}\n*[[Artificial wave pool]]\n*[[ASP World Tour]]\n*[[Dog surfing]]\n*[[Duke Kahanamoku]]\n*''[[The Endless Summer]]''\n*[[Hawaiian scale]]\n*[[History of surfing]]\n*[[Lake surfing]]\n*[[List of surfers]]\n*[[List of surfing events]]\n*[[List of surfing terminology]]\n*[[List of surfing topics]]\n*[[Ocean wave]]\n*[[River surfing]]\n*[[Standup paddleboarding]]\n*[[Surf break]]\n*[[Surf forecasting]]\n*[[Surf lifesaving]], [[Surf Life Saving Club]] and [[nippers]]\n*[[Surf music]]\n*[[Surf zone]]\n*[[Surfer's ear]]\n*[[:Category:Surfing by country|List of \"Surfing in ...\" articles]]\n:*[[Surfing in Canada]]\n:*[[Surfing in Madeira]]\n:*[[Surfing in the United States]]\n*[[Triple Crown of Surfing]]\n*[[Women's surfing]]\n*[[World championship tour (WCT) surfing|World Championship Tour (WCT)]]\n*[[World surfing champion]]\n\n{{Div col end}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n==Further reading==\n* {{cite web | author=Baron, Zach | title=At Home With the Best Surfer on the Planet | website=GQ | date=15 May 2017 | url=https://www.gq.com/story/at-home-with-john-john-florence | ref=harv | access-date=11 December 2017}}\n\n==External links==\n{{Wikiquote|Surfing}}\n{{Commons and category|Surfing}}\n{{Wikivoyage|Surfing}}\n* [http://www.worldsurfleague.com/ World Surf League]\n* [http://www.surftotal.com/en/ Surf Total]\n* [http://www.surfhandbook.com/ Surf Handbook]\n\n{{Surfing}}\n{{Sports of the World Games program}}\n{{Extreme sports}}\n{{Summer Olympic sports}}\n\n{{Authority control}}\n\n[[Category:Sports originating in the United States]]\n[[Category:Surfing| ]]\n[[Category:Individual sports]]\n[[Category:Articles containing video clips]]\n[[Category:Hawaii culture]]\n[[Category:California culture]]\n[[Category:Summer Olympic sports]]\n[[Category:Water sports]]\n[[Category:Boardsports]]\n[[Category:Partial squatting position]]\n", "text_old": "{{short description|Sport that consists of riding a wave}}\n{{About|stand-up ocean surfing}}\n{{Redirect|Surfer}}\n{{Use dmy dates|date=February 2014}}\n{{Infobox sport\n| name           = Surfing\n| image          = Mavericks Surf Contest 2010b.jpg\n| caption        = Mavericks Surf Contest 2010\n| union          = [[World Surf League]] (WSL), [[International Surfing Association]] (ISA) \n| first          = \n| country/region = [[World]]wide\n| registered     = \n| clubs          = \n| contact        = \n| team           = \n| mgender        = Yes, separate competitions\n| category       = \n| equipment      = \n| venue          = \n| olympic        = Will debut in [[Surfing at the 2020 Summer Olympics|2021]] \n| paralympic     = \n}}\n[[File:Maggie Hallahan Jaws Hawaii.jpg|thumb|Big wave surfing at Jaws in Maui, Hawaii]]\n'''Surfing''' is a [[list of surface water sports|surface water sport]] in which the wave rider, referred to as a surfer, rides on the forward part, or face, of a moving [[wind wave|wave]], which usually carries the surfer towards the [[shore]]. Waves suitable for surfing are primarily found in the [[ocean]], but can also be found in [[Lake surfing|lakes]] or [[River surfing|rivers]] in the form of a [[standing wave]] or [[tidal bore]]. However, surfers can also utilize artificial waves such as those from boat wakes and the waves created in artificial [[wave pool]]s.\n[[File:Mick Corbett at Cow Bombie.jpg|thumb|Mick Corbett at Cow Bombie]]\nThe term ''surfing'' refers to the act of riding a wave with a board, regardless of the stance used. There are several types of boards. The [[Polynesian culture|native peoples of the Pacific]], for instance, surfed waves on [[alaia]], paipo, and other such craft, and did so on their belly and knees. The modern-day definition of surfing, however, most often refers to a surfer riding a wave standing on a [[surfboard]]; this is also referred to as stand-up surfing.\n\nAnother prominent form of surfing is [[body boarding]], when a surfer rides a wave on a bodyboard, either lying on their belly, drop knee (one foot and one knee on the board), or sometimes even standing up on a body board. Other types of surfing include knee boarding, surf matting (riding inflatable mats), and using foils. [[Body surfing]], where the wave is surfed without a board, using the surfer's own body to catch and ride the wave, is very common and is considered by some to be the purest form of surfing. The closest form of body surfing using a board is a handboard which normally has one strap over it to fit one hand in.\n\nThree major subdivisions within stand-up surfing are [[Standup paddleboarding|stand-up paddling]], [[Surfboard#Long board|long boarding]] and [[Surfboard#Short board|short boarding]] with several major differences including the board design and length, the riding style, and the kind of wave that is ridden.\n\nIn [[tow-in surfing]] (most often, but not exclusively, associated with [[big wave surfing]]), a motorized water vehicle such as a [[personal watercraft]], tows the surfer into the wave front helping the surfer match a large wave's speed, which is generally a higher speed than a self-propelled surfer can produce. Surfing-related sports such as [[paddle boarding]] and [[sea kayaking]] do not require waves, and other derivative sports such as [[kite surfing]] and [[windsurfing]] rely primarily on wind for power, yet all of these platforms may also be used to ride waves. Recently with the use of [[V-drive]] boats, [[Wakesurfing]], in which one surfs on the wake of a boat, has emerged. The [[Guinness Book of World Records]] recognized a {{convert|78|ft|m|order=flip|abbr=on|sigfig=3}} wave ride by [[Garrett McNamara]] at [[Nazar\u00e9, Portugal|Nazar\u00e9]], [[Portugal]] as the largest wave ever surfed.<ref>{{cite news|title=Surfer rides World Record 24 m (78 ft) wave|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-us-canada-18036392|work=BBC News|accessdate=29 January 2013|date=12 May 2012}}</ref>\n\n==Origins and history==\n{{Main|History of surfing}}\n{{See also|Surfing in the United States}}\n\nFor hundreds of years, surfing was a central part of ancient [[Polynesian culture]]. Surfing may have first been observed by British explorers at [[Tahiti]] in 1767. [[Samuel Wallis]] and the crew members of {{HMS|Dolphin|1751|6}} were the first Britons to visit the island in June of that year. Another candidate is the botanist [[Joseph Banks]]<ref>Fleming, F. (c. 2005). ''Off the Map: Tales of Endurance and Exploration'', p. 154. Atlantic Monthly Press.</ref> being part of the [[first voyage of James Cook]] on {{HMS|Endeavour}}, who arrived on Tahiti on 10 April 1769. Lieutenant [[James King (Royal Navy officer)|James King]] was the first person to write about the art of surfing on [[Hawaii]] when he was completing the journals of Captain [[James Cook]] upon Cook's death in 1779.\n\nWhen [[Mark Twain]] visited Hawaii in 1866 he wrote,\n<blockquote>In one place we came upon a large company of naked natives, of both sexes and all ages, amusing themselves with the national pastime of surf-bathing.<ref>{{cite book |last=Twain |first=Mark |title=Roughing It |year=2007 |publisher=Digireads.com Publishing |location=Lawrence, Kansas |isbn=9781420930283 |page=264 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=gjUOvGeK51MC}}</ref></blockquote>\n\nReferences to surf riding on planks and single canoe hulls are also verified for pre-contact [[Samoa]], where surfing was called ''fa'ase'e'' or ''se'egalu'' (see Augustin Kr\u00e4mer, ''The Samoa Islands''<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=LHyUEUwaUdAC|title=The Samoa Islands|accessdate=8 November 2014|isbn=9780824822194|last1=Kr\u00e4mer|first1=Augustin|year=2000}}</ref>), and [[Tonga]], far pre-dating the practice of surfing by Hawaiians and eastern Polynesians by over a thousand years.\n\nIn July 1885, three [https://santacruzmah.org/2015/the-birth-of-surf-city-july-3-october-25-2015/ teenage Hawaiian princes] took a break from their boarding school, St. Mathew's Hall in San Mateo, and came to cool off in Santa Cruz, California.

He is thought to have been the first modern surfer.\n\nIn 1907, the eclectic interests of the [[land baron]] [[Henry E. Huntington]] brought the ancient art of surfing to the California coast. While on vacation, Huntington had seen Hawaiian boys surfing the island waves. Looking for a way to entice visitors to the area of [[Redondo Beach, California|Redondo Beach]], where he had heavily invested in real estate, he hired a young Hawaiian to ride surfboards. George Freeth decided to revive the art of surfing, but had little success with the huge {{convert|16|ft|cm|order=flip|abbr=on|round=50}} hardwood boards that were popular at that time. When he cut them in half to make them more manageable, he created the original \"Long board\", which made him the talk of the islands. To the delight of visitors, Freeth exhibited his surfing skills twice a day in front of the [[Hotel Redondo]]. Another native Hawaiian, [[Duke Kahanamoku]], spread surfing to both the U.S. and Australia, riding the waves after displaying the swimming prowess that won him Olympic gold medals in 1912 and 1920.\n\nIn 1975, a professional tour started.<ref name=\"Woman of the Year\">{{cite web | title=Woman of the Year | website=Surfing Walk of Fame | url=http://www.surfingwalkoffame.com/woman/Oberg.html | access-date=11 December 2017 | url-status=dead | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170806224253/http://www.surfingwalkoffame.com/woman/Oberg.html | archive-date=6 August 2017 | df=dmy-all }}</ref> That year [[Margo Oberg]] became the first female professional surfer.<ref name=\"Woman of the Year\"/>\n\n==Surf waves==\n<!-- [[Surf wave]] redirects here -->\n{{See also|Ocean surface wave}}\n[[File:Pipeline Barrel (51633882).jpeg|thumb|Pipeline Barrel at [[P\u016bp\u016bkea, Hawaii]]]]\n[[File:A surfer surfing on the ocean (Unsplash).jpg|thumb|Surfer getting tubed at [[Sunset Beach (Oahu)|Sunset]] on the [[North Shore (Oahu)|North Shore]] of [[Oahu]]]]\n[[File:Surfers at Mavericks.jpg|thumb|right|A large wave breaking at Mavericks]]\n\n[[Swell (ocean)|Swell]] is generated when the wind blows consistently over a large area of open water, called the wind's [[fetch (geography)|fetch]]. The size of a swell is determined by the strength of the wind and the length of its fetch and duration. Because of this, the surf tends to be larger and more prevalent on coastlines exposed to large expanses of ocean traversed by intense [[low-pressure area|low pressure systems]].\n\nLocal wind conditions affect wave quality since the surface of a wave can become choppy in blustery conditions. Ideal conditions include a light to moderate \"offshore\" wind, because it blows into the front of the wave, making it a [[Barreling wave|\"barrel\"]] or \"tube\" wave. Waves are Left handed and Right Handed depending upon the breaking formation of the wave.\n\nWaves are generally recognized by the surfaces over which they break.<ref>The Bluffer's Guides, The Bluffer's Guide to Surfing, Oval Books, 2008.</ref> For example, there are beach breaks, reef breaks and point breaks.\n\nThe most important influence on wave shape is the [[bathymetry|topography of the seabed]] directly behind and immediately beneath the breaking wave. The contours of the [[reef]] or bar front become stretched by [[diffraction]]. Each break is different since each location's underwater topography is unique. At beach breaks, sandbanks change shape from week to week. [[Surf forecasting]] is aided by advances in information technology. Mathematical modeling graphically depicts the size and direction of swells around the globe.\n\nSwell regularity varies across the globe and throughout the year. During winter, heavy swells are generated in the mid-latitudes, when the North and South [[polar front]]s shift toward the [[Equator]]. The predominantly Westerly winds generate swells that advance Eastward, so waves tend to be largest on West coasts during winter months. However, an endless train of [[mid-latitude cyclone]]s cause the [[isobar (meteorology)|isobar]]s to become undulated, redirecting swells at regular intervals toward the tropics.<!-- what is an undulated isobar? -->\n\nEast coasts also receive heavy winter swells when low-pressure cells form in the sub-tropics, where slow moving [[anti-cyclone|highs]] inhibit their movement. These lows produce a shorter fetch than polar fronts, however, they can still generate heavy swells since their slower movement increases the duration of a particular wind direction. The variables of fetch and duration both influence how long wind acts over a wave as it travels since a wave reaching the end of a fetch behaves as if the wind died.\n\nDuring summer, heavy swells are generated when cyclones form in the tropics. [[Tropical cyclone]]s form over warm seas, so their occurrence is influenced by [[El Ni\u00f1o-Southern Oscillation|El Ni\u00f1o & La Ni\u00f1a]] cycles. Their movements are unpredictable.\n\nSurf travel and some surf camps offer surfers access to remote, tropical locations, where [[tradewinds]] ensure offshore conditions. Since winter swells are generated by [[mid-latitude cyclone]]s, their regularity coincides with the passage of these lows. Swells arrive in pulses, each lasting for a couple of days, with a few days between each swell.\n\nThe availability of free [[Numerical weather prediction|model data]] from the [[NOAA]] has allowed the creation of several [[surf forecasting]] websites.\n\n===Wave intensity===\n[[File:Wave-shape-intensity.svg|thumb|upright=1.35|The [[geometry]] of tube shape can be represented as a ratio between length and width.]]\n\nTube shape is defined by length to width ratio.

Artificial surfing reefs can be built with durable sandbags or concrete, and resemble a submerged breakwater. These artificial reefs not only provide a surfing location, but also dissipate wave energy and shelter the coastline from erosion. Ships such as [[Seli 1]] that have accidentally stranded on sandy bottoms, can create sandbanks that give rise to good waves.<ref>{{cite web|title=Seli 1: One Year On|url=http://www.zigzag.co.za/news/enviro/6709/Seli-1|work=ZigZag|publisher=Online Publishers Association South Africa|accessdate=25 May 2012|author=Clayton Truscott|date=23 September 2009}}</ref>\n\nAn artificial reef known as [[Chevron Reef]] was constructed in [[El Segundo, California]] in hopes of creating a new surfing area. However, the reef failed to produce any quality waves and was removed in 2008. In [[Kovalam]], South West India, an artificial reef has, however, successfully provided the local community with a quality lefthander, stabilized coastal soil erosion, and provided good habitat for [[marine life]].<ref>{{cite news|title=India's first artificial reef to protect Kovalam|url=http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/Indias-first-artificial-reef-to-protect-Kovalam/articleshow/5951403.cms|accessdate=25 May 2012|newspaper=The Times Of India|date=20 May 2010|author=TNN}}</ref> ASR Ltd., a New Zealand-based company, constructed the Kovalam reef and is working on [[Boscombe Surf Reef|another reef]] in Boscombe, England.\n\n==Artificial waves==\n[[File:Surf IMG 0949 (3120282731).jpg|thumb|upright=0.8|Surfing a stationary, artificial wave in Southern California]]\n\nEven with artificial reefs in place, a tourist's vacation time may coincide with a \"flat spell\", when no waves are available. Completely artificial [[Wave pool]]s aim to solve that problem by controlling all the elements that go into creating perfect surf, however there are only a handful of wave pools that can [[simulate]] good surfing waves, owing primarily to construction and operation costs and potential liability. Most wave pools generate waves that are too small and lack the power necessary to surf. The [[Seagaia Ocean Dome]], located in Miyazaki, Japan, was an example of a surfable wave pool. Able to generate waves with up to {{convert|3|m|ft||abbr=on|sigfig=1}} faces, the specialized pump held water in 20 vertical tanks positioned along the back edge of the pool. This allowed the waves to be directed as they approach the artificial sea floor. Lefts, Rights, and A-frames could be directed from this pump design providing for rippable surf and barrel rides. The Ocean Dome cost about $2&nbsp;billion to build and was expensive to maintain.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.surfline.com/mag/pulse/2000/nov/11_8_japan.cfm|title=MADE IN JAPAN Unlike its counterparts, Miyazaki's Ocean Dome wavepool is for real|author=Duncan Scott|date=8 November 2000|work=Surfline|publisher=Surfline/Wavetrak, Inc|accessdate=25 May 2012}}</ref> The Ocean Dome was closed in 2007. In England, construction is nearing completion on the Wave,<ref name=\"the-wave\">{{cite web | title=Sustainable inland surfing destinations | website=The Wave Bristol | url=http://thewave.com/Bristol/ | access-date=11 December 2017}}</ref> situated near [[Bristol]], which will enable people unable to get to the coast to enjoy the waves in a controlled environment, set in the heart of nature.\n\nThere are two main types of artificial waves that exist today. One being artificial or stationary waves which simulate a moving, breaking wave by pumping a layer of water against a smooth structure mimicking the shape of a breaking wave. Because of the velocity of the rushing water the wave and the surfer can remain stationary while the water rushes by under the surfboard. Artificial waves of this kind provide the opportunity to try surfing and learn its basics in a moderately small and controlled environment near or far from locations with natural surf.\n\nAnother artificial wave can be made through use of a [[wave pool]]. These wave pools strive to make a wave that replicates a real ocean wave more than the stationary wave does. In 2018, the first professional surfing tournament in a wave pool was held.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Rose|first1=Brent|title=Is The First Pro Surfing Contest In A Wave Pool The Sport's Future, Or Its Bastardization?|url=https://deadspin.com/is-the-first-pro-surfing-contest-in-a-wave-pool-the-spo-1825848433#o6hi39el133n3an9yqmdatt1w.2sp2nmrdrwe13|accessdate=11 May 2018|work=[[Deadspin]]|date=10 May 2018}}</ref>\n\n==Surfers and surf culture==\n{{Main|Surf culture}}\n[[File:Shaka-sign.png|left|The [[Shaka sign]]|thumb|alt=Photo of back of human wrist and hand. The thumb and pinkie are extended and the other fingers are folded against the palm.]]\n\nSurfers represent a diverse [[surf culture|culture]] based on riding the waves. Some people practice surfing as a [[recreation]]al activity while others make it the central focus of their lives. Surfing culture is most dominant in [[Hawaii]] and [[California]] because these two states offer the best surfing conditions. However, waves can be found wherever there is coastline, and a tight-knit yet far-reaching subculture of surfers has emerged throughout America. Some historical markers of the culture included the [[woodie (car body style)|woodie]], the station wagon used to carry surfers' boards, as well as [[boardshorts]], the long swim shorts typically worn while surfing. Surfers also wear wetsuits in colder regions.\n\nThe sport is also a significant part of [[Australia]]'s eastern coast sub-cultural life <ref>[http://www.thearkatech.com/liam-hemsworth/6346/ Liam Hemsworth leaves 2019 with surfboard]</ref>, especially in [[New South Wales]], where the weather and water conditions are most favourable for surfing.\n\nDuring the 1960s, as surfing caught on in California, its popularity spread through American pop culture. Several teen movies, starting with the [[Gidget]] series in 1959, transformed surfing into a dream life for American youth. Later movies, including [[Beach Party]] (1963), [[Ride the Wild Surf]] (1964), and [[Beach Blanket Bingo]] (1965) promoted the California dream of sun and surf.  Surf culture also fueled the early records of the [[Beach Boys]].\n\nThe sport of surfing now represents a multibillion-dollar industry especially in [[Surf culture#Fashion|clothing and fashion]] markets. [[World Surf League|The World Surf League (WSL)]] runs the championship tour, hosting top competitors in some of the best surf spots around the globe. A small number of people make a career out of surfing by receiving corporate sponsorships and performing for photographers and videographers in far-flung destinations; they are typically referred to as freesurfers. Sixty-six surfboarders on a {{convert|42|ft|m|order=flip|abbr=on|sigfig=2}} long surfboard set a record in [[Huntington Beach, California]] for most people on a surfboard at one time. [[Dale Webster]] consecutively surfed for 14,641 days, making it his main life focus.\n\nWhen the waves were flat, surfers persevered with [[skateboarding|sidewalk surfing]], which is now called skateboarding. Sidewalk surfing has a similar feel to surfing and requires only a paved road or sidewalk. To create the feel of the wave, surfers even sneak into empty backyard swimming pools to ride in, known as pool skating. Eventually, surfing made its way to the slopes with the invention of the [[Snurfer]], later credited as the first snowboard. Many other board sports have been invented over the years, but all can trace their heritage back to surfing.\n\nMany surfers claim to have a spiritual connection with the ocean, describing surfing, the surfing experience, both in and out of the water, as a type of spiritual experience or a religion.<ref name=\"huffingtonpost\">{{cite web|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/08/03/religion-of-surfing_n_5617472.html|title=The Spirituality Of Surfing: Finding Religion Riding The Waves|publisher=huffingtonpost.com|accessdate=26 August 2015|date=3 August 2014}}</ref>\n\n==Maneuvers==\n[[File:Mavericks and surfer.jpg|A surfer at [[Mavericks (location)|Mavericks]]|thumb]]\n[[File:Big wave breaking in Santa Cruz.jpg|right|thumb|A surfer going for the tube|alt=Photo of surfer at bottom of wave, attempting to let tube envelop him]]\n[[File:Surfing contest - oahu hawaii - north shore - oct 2015.ogv|thumb|thumbtime=6|right|Catching waves at a surfing contest on the [[North Shore (Oahu)|North Shore]] of [[Oahu]], [[Hawaii]]]]\n\nStandup surfing begins when the surfer paddles toward shore in an attempt to match the speed of the wave (the same applies whether the surfer is standup paddling, bodysurfing, boogie-boarding or using some other type of watercraft, such as a waveski or kayak). Once the wave begins to carry the surfer forward, the surfer stands up and proceeds to ride the wave. The basic idea is to position the surfboard so it is just ahead of the breaking part (whitewash) of the wave. A common problem for beginners is being able to catch the wave at all.\n\nSurfers' skills are tested by their ability to control their board in difficult conditions, riding challenging waves, and executing maneuvers such as strong turns and cutbacks (turning board back to the breaking wave) and ''carving'' (a series of strong back-to-back maneuvers). More advanced skills include the ''floater'' (riding on top of the breaking curl of the wave), and ''off the lip'' (banking off the breaking wave). A newer addition to surfing is the progression of the ''air'' whereby a surfer propels off the wave entirely up into the air, and then successfully lands the board back on the wave.\n\nThe tube ride is considered to be the ultimate maneuver in surfing. As a wave breaks, if the conditions are ideal, the wave will break in an orderly line from the middle to the shoulder, enabling the experienced surfer to position themselves inside the wave as it is breaking. This is known as a tube ride. Viewed from the shore, the tube rider may disappear from view as the wave breaks over the rider's head. The longer the surfer remains in the tube, the more successful the ride. This is referred to as getting tubed, barrelled, shacked or pitted. Some of the world's best known waves for tube riding include Pipeline on the North shore of Oahu, Teahupoo in Tahiti and G-Land in Java. Other names for the tube include \"the barrel\", and \"the pit\".\n\n[[Hanging ten]] and hanging five are moves usually specific to long boarding. Hanging Ten refers to having both feet on the front end of the board with all of the surfer's toes off the edge, also known as nose-riding. Hanging Five is having just one foot near the front, with five toes off the edge.\n\nCutback: Generating speed down the line and then turning back to reverse direction.\n\nFloater: Suspending the board atop the wave. Very popular on small waves.\n\nTop-Turn: Turn off the top of the wave. Sometimes used to generate speed and sometimes to shoot spray.\n\nAirs/Aerials: These maneuvers have been becoming more and more prevalent in the sport in both competition and free surfing. An air is when the surfer can achieve enough speed and approach a certain type of section of a wave that is supposed to act as a ramp and launch the surfer above the lip line of the wave, \u201ccatching air\u201d, and landing either in the transition of the wave or the whitewash when hitting a close-out section.\n\nAirs can either be straight airs or rotational airs. Straight airs have minimal rotation if any, but definitely no more rotation than 90 degrees. Rotational airs require a rotation of 90 degrees or more depending on the level of the surfer.\n\nTypes of rotations:\n\n* 180 degrees \u2013 called an air reverse, this is when the surfer spins enough to land backwards, then reverts to their original positional with the help of the fins. This rotation can either be done frontside or backside, and can spin right or left.\n* 360 degrees \u2013 this is a full rotation air or \u201cfull rotor\u201d where the surfer lands where they started or more, as long as they do not land backwards. When this is achieved front side on a wave spinning the opposite of an air reverse is called an alley oop.\n* 540 degrees \u2013 the surfer does a full rotation plus another 180 degrees, and can be inverted or spinning straight, few surfers have been able to land this air.\n* Backflip \u2013 usually done with a double grab, this hard to land air is made for elite level surfers.\n* Rodeo flip \u2013 usually done backside, it is a backflip with a 180 rotation, and is actually easier than a straight backflip.\n* Grabs \u2013 a surfer can help land an aerial maneuver by grabbing the surfboard, keeping them attached to the board and keeping the board under their feet. Common types of grabs include:\n** Indy \u2013 a grab on the surfers (inside rail going frontside, outside rail going backside) with their back hand.\n** Slob \u2013 a grab on the surfers (inside rail going frontside, outside rail going backside) with their front hand.\n** Lien \u2013 A grab on the surfers (outside rail frontside, inside rail going backside) with their front hand.\n** Stalefish \u2013 A grab on the surfers (outside rail frontside, inside rail backside) with their back hand.\n** Double grab \u2013 A grab on the surfers inside and outside rail, the inside rail with the back hand and the outside rail with the front hand.\n\n===Terms===\nThe [[Glossary of surfing]] includes some of the extensive [[vocabulary]] used to describe various aspects of the sport of surfing as described in literature on the subject.<ref>{{cite book |last=Finney |first=Ben |author2=Houston, James D. |title=Surfing \u2013 A History of the Ancient Hawaiian Sport |publisher=Pomegranate Artbooks |location=Rohnett, CA |isbn=978-0-87654-594-2 |chapter=Appendix A \u2013 Hawaiian Surfing terms |pages=94\u201397 |year=1996}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |last=Guisado |first=Raul |title=The Art of Surfing: A Training Manual for the Developing and Competitive Surfer |publisher=Globe Pequot Press |location=Guilford, CT |year=2003 |chapter=Appendix A \u2013 Glossary of Surfing Lingo |pages=[https://archive.org/details/artofsurfingtrai0000guis/page/165 165\u20130170] |isbn=978-0-7627-2466-6 |url=https://archive.org/details/artofsurfingtrai0000guis/page/165 }}</ref> In some cases terms have spread to a wider cultural use. These terms were originally coined by people who were directly involved in the sport of surfing.\n\n==Learning==\nMany popular surfing destinations have surf schools and surf camps that offer lessons. Surf camps for beginners and intermediates are multi-day lessons that focus on surfing fundamentals. They are designed to take new surfers and help them become proficient riders. All-inclusive surf camps offer overnight accommodations, meals, lessons and surfboards. Most surf lessons begin with instruction and a safety briefing on land, followed by instructors helping students into waves on longboards or \"softboards\". The softboard is considered the ideal surfboard for learning, due to the fact it is safer, and has more paddling speed and stability than shorter boards. Funboards are also a popular shape for beginners as they combine the volume and stability of the longboard with the manageable size of a smaller surfboard.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://hvsboardsport.com/howtosurf/|title=How to surf; learn to surf in one day|author=Kristian Hansen|date=20 November 2017|website=hvsboardsport.com|publisher=Hvs Boardsport|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171201131256/https://hvsboardsport.com/howtosurf/|archive-date=1 December 2017|url-status=dead|access-date=20 November 2017}}</ref> New and inexperienced surfers typically learn to catch waves on softboards around the {{convert|7|to|8|ft|cm|order=flip|abbr=on|sigfig=2}} funboard size. Due to the softness of the surfboard the chance of getting injured is substantially minimized.\n\nTypical surfing instruction is best performed one-on-one, but can also be done in a group setting. The most popular surf locations offer perfect surfing conditions for beginners, as well as challenging breaks for advanced students. The ideal conditions for learning would be small waves that crumble and break softly, as opposed to the steep, fast-peeling waves desired by more experienced surfers. When available, a sandy seabed is generally safer.\n\nSurfing can be broken into several skills: Paddling strength, Positioning to catch the wave, timing, and balance. Paddling out requires strength, but also the mastery of techniques to break through oncoming waves (''duck diving'', ''eskimo roll''). Take-off positioning requires experience at predicting the wave set and where they will break. The surfer must pop up quickly as soon as the wave starts pushing the board forward. Preferred positioning on the wave is determined by experience at reading wave features including where the wave is breaking.<ref name=\"learnhowtosurf\">{{cite web |url=http://www.learnhowtosurf.info/how-to-surf/ |title=The quick guide on how to surf |publisher=learnhowtosurf.info |access-date=26 August 2015 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120831054300/http://www.learnhowtosurf.info/how-to-surf/ |archive-date=31 August 2012 |df=dmy-all }}</ref> Balance plays a crucial role in standing on a surfboard. Thus, balance training exercises are a good preparation. Practicing with a [[Balance board]] or swing boarding helps novices master the art.\n\nThe repetitive cycle of paddling, popping up, and balancing requires stamina, explosivity, and near-constant core stabilization. Having a proper warm up routine can help prevent injuries.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.menshealth.com/fitness/a19528572/torrey-meister-warm-up-us-open-surfing/|title=Warm Up So You Don't Wipe Out|date=2017-08-01|work=Men's Health|access-date=2018-11-13|language=en-US}}</ref>\n\n==Equipment==\n[[File:Waxing a surfboard.jpg|thumb|[[Surfboard wax|Waxing]] a surfboard|alt=Photo of woman bent over surfboard rubbing bar of solid wax against the board with palm trees and ocean in background]]\n[[File:Surf Leash.JPG|thumb|[[Surfboard leash]]|alt=Photo of plastic cord attached to surfboard and velcroed around surfer's ankle]]\n\nSurfing can be done on various equipment, including [[surfboard]]s, [[Longboard (surfing)|longboards]], [[Stand up paddle surfing|stand up paddle boards (SUPs)]], [[bodyboard]]s, [[Waveski|wave skis]], [[skimboard]]s, [[kneeboard]]s, surf mats and macca's trays. [[Surfboard]]s were originally made of solid wood and were large and heavy (often up to {{convert|12|ft|cm|order=flip|abbr=on|sigfig=2}} long and having a mass of {{convert|150|lb|kg|order=flip|abbr=on|sigfig=1}}). Lighter [[balsa wood]] surfboards (first made in the late 1940s and early 1950s) were a significant improvement, not only in portability, but also in increasing maneuverability.\n\nMost modern surfboards are made of [[fiberglass]] foam (PU), with one or more wooden strips or \"stringers\", fiberglass cloth, and [[polyester resin]] (PE). An emerging board material is [[epoxy resin]] and [[Polystyrene#Expanded polystyrene|Expanded Polystyrene]] foam (EPS) which is stronger and lighter than traditional PU/PE construction. Even newer designs incorporate materials such as [[carbon fiber]] and variable-flex composites in conjunction with fiberglass and epoxy or polyester resins. Since epoxy/EPS surfboards are generally lighter, they will float better than a traditional PU/PE board of similar size, shape and thickness. This makes them easier to paddle and faster in the water. However, a common complaint of EPS boards is that they do not provide as much feedback as a traditional PU/PE board. For this reason, many advanced surfers prefer that their surfboards be made from traditional materials.\n\nOther equipment includes a [[Surfboard leash|leash]] (to stop the board from drifting away after a wipeout, and to prevent it from hitting other surfers), [[surf wax]], traction pads (to keep a surfer's feet from slipping off the deck of the board), and fins (also known as ''skegs'') which can either be permanently attached (''glassed-on'') or interchangeable. [[Sportswear (activewear)|Sportswear]] designed or particularly suitable for surfing may be sold as ''boardwear'' (the term is also used in [[snowboarding]]). In warmer climates, swimsuits, surf trunks or [[boardshorts]] are worn, and occasionally [[rash guard]]s; in cold water surfers can opt to wear [[wetsuit]]s, boots, hoods, and gloves to protect them against lower water temperatures. A newer introduction is a rash vest with a thin layer of [[titanium]] to provide maximum warmth without compromising mobility. In recent years, there have been advancements in technology that have allowed surfers to pursue even bigger waves with added elements of safety. Big wave surfers are now experimenting with inflatable vests or colored dye packs to help decrease their odds of drowning.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Surfer|title=Bigger and Better|url=http://www.surfermag.com/features/big-wave-surfing-innovations/|accessdate=29 December 2014|work=Surfer Magazine|publisher=Surfer Magazine|date=15 September 2014|ref=http://www.surfermag.com/author/surfer/}}</ref>\n\n[[File:1999 - Surf \u00e0 Waikiki Beach Honolulu Hawa\u00ef.jpg|thumb|left|upright=1.2|Longboards at [[Waikiki beach]]|alt=Photo of dozens of surfboards on rack.

Modern [[Surfboard#Variations|longboard]]s, generally {{convert|9|to|10|ft|cm|order=flip|abbr=on|sigfig=2}} in length, are reminiscent of the earliest surfboards, but now benefit from modern innovations in surfboard shaping and fin design. Competitive longboard surfers need to be competent at traditional ''walking'' manoeuvres, as well as the short-radius turns normally associated with shortboard surfing. The modern [[Surfboard#Variations|shortboard]] began life in the late 1960s and has evolved into today's common ''thruster'' style, defined by its three fins, usually around {{convert|6|to|7|ft|cm|order=flip|abbr=on|sigfig=2}} in length. The thruster was invented by Australian [[Surfboard shaper|shaper]] [[Simon Anderson]].\n\nMidsize boards, often called [[Surfboard#Variations|funboard]]s, provide more maneuverability than a longboard, with more flotation than a shortboard. While many surfers find that funboards live up to their name, providing the best of both surfing modes, others are critical.\n\n:\"It is the happy medium of mediocrity,\" writes Steven Kotler. \"Funboard riders either have nothing left to prove or lack the skills to prove anything.\"<ref>{{cite book\n  | last =Kotler\n  | first =Steven\n  | title =West of Jesus: Surfing, Science, and the Origins of Belief\n  | publisher =Bloomsbury\n  | date =13 June 2006\n  | isbn =978-1-59691-051-5 }}</ref>\n\nThere are also various niche styles, such as the ''Egg'', a longboard-style short board targeted for people who want to ride a shortboard but need more paddle power. The ''Fish'', a board which is typically shorter, flatter, and wider than a normal shortboard, often with a split tail (known as a ''swallow tail''). The Fish often has two or four [[Surfboard Fins|fins]] and is specifically designed for surfing smaller waves. For big waves there is the ''Gun'', a long, thick board with a pointed nose and tail (known as a pin tail) specifically designed for big waves.\n\n== The physics of surfing ==\n{{Multiple image\n|align=right |direction=vertical |width=240\n|image1=Nazar\u00e9, Portugal (Unsplash 7bt4ngmSu9Y).jpg |caption1=[[Tow-in surfing]] in [[Nazar\u00e9, Portugal]]\n|image2=Praia do Norte, Nazar\u00e9, Portugal (33830450815).jpg |caption2=Giant [[breaking wave]]s in [[Praia do Norte (Nazar\u00e9)|Praia do Norte]]\n|image3=Can you see the surfer?

Waves increase in energy and speed, and then become longer and stronger.<ref name=Scarfe2009 /> The fully developed sea has the strongest wave action that experiences storms lasting 10-hours and creates 15 meter wave heights  in the open ocean.<ref name=Talley2011 />\n\nThe waves created in the open ocean are classified as deep-water waves. Deep-water waves have no bottom interaction and the orbits of these water molecules are circular; their wavelength is short relative to water depth and the velocity decays before the reaching the bottom of the water basin.<ref name=Talley2011 /> Deep waves have depths greater than \u00bd their wavelengths. Wind forces waves to break in the deep sea.\n\nDeep-water waves travel to shore and become shallow water waves. Shallow water waves have depths less than \u00bd of their wavelength. Shallow wave's wavelengths are long relative to water depth and have elliptical orbitals. The wave velocity effects the entire water basin. The water interacts with the bottom as it approaches shore and has a drag interaction. The drag interaction pulls on the bottom of the wave, causes refraction, increases the height, decreases the celerity (or the speed of the wave form), and the top (crest) falls over. This phenomenon happens because the velocity of the top of the wave is greater than the velocity of the bottom of the wave.<ref name=Talley2011>{{cite book|last=Talley |first=Lynne D. |title=Descriptive Physical Oceanography: An Introduction |date=2011 |publisher=Academic Press |isbn=978-0-08-093911-7 |pages=223\u2013244 |chapter=Chapter 8.

A wave suitable for surfing results from maximum speeds of 5 meters per second. This speed is relative because local onshore winds can cause waves to break.<ref name=Scarfe2009 /> In the surf zone, shallow water waves are carried by global winds to the beach and interact with local winds to make surfing waves.<ref name=Scarfe2009 /><ref name=Madsen1997 />\n\nDifferent onshore and off-shore wind patterns in the surf zone create different types of waves.

The breaking wave height has two measurements, the relative heights estimated by surfers and the exact measurements done by physical oceanographers. Measurements done by surfers were 1.36 to 2.58 times higher than the measurements done by scientists. The scientifically concluded wave heights that are physically possible to surf are 1 to 20 meters.<ref name=Scarfe2009 />\n\nThe wave peel angle is one of the main constituents of a potential surfing wave. Wave peel angle measures the distance between the peel-line and the line tangent to the breaking crest line. This angle controls the speed of the wave crest. The speed of the wave is an addition of the propagation velocity vector (Vw) and peel velocity vector (Vp), which results in the overall velocity of the wave (Vs).<ref name=Scarfe2009 />\n\nWave breaking intensity measures the force of the wave as it breaks, spills, or plunges (a plunging wave is termed by surfers as a \"barrel wave\"). Wave section length is the distance between two breaking crests in a wave set. Wave section length can be hard to measure because local winds, non-linear wave interactions, island sheltering, and swell interactions can cause multifarious wave configurations in the surf zone.<ref name=Scarfe2009 />\n\nThe parameters breaking wave height, wave peel angle (\u03b1), and wave breaking intensity, and wave section length are important because they are standardized by past oceanographers who researched surfing; these parameters have been used to create a guide that matches the type of wave formed and the skill level of surfer.<ref name=Scarfe2009>{{cite journal |last1=Scarfe |first1=Bradley E. |author2=Terry R.

Smaller wave peel angles increase the velocities of waves. A surfer must know how to react and paddle quickly to match the speed of the wave to catch it. Therefore, more experience is required to catch a low peel angle waves. More experienced surfers can handle longer section lengths, increased velocities, and higher wave heights.<ref name=Scarfe2009 /> Different locations offer different types of surfing conditions for each skill level.\n\n=== Surf breaks ===\nA [[surf break]] is an area with an obstruction or an object that causes a wave to break. Surf breaks entail multiple scale phenomena. Wave section creation has micro-scale factors of peel angle and wave breaking intensity. The micro-scale components influence wave height and variations on wave crests. The mesoscale components of surf breaks are the ramp, platform, wedge, or ledge that may be present at a surf break. Macro-scale processes are the global winds that initially produce offshore waves. Types of surf breaks are headlands (point break), beach break, river/estuary entrance bar, reef breaks, and ledge breaks.<ref name=Scarfe2009 />\n\n==== Headland (point break) ====\nA [[headland]] or point break interacts with the water by causing refraction around the point or headland. The point absorbs the high frequency waves and long period waves persist, which are easier to surf. Examples of locations that have headland or point break induced surf breaks are Dunedin (New Zealand), Raglan, Malibu (California), Rincon (California), and Kirra (Australia).<ref name=Scarfe2009 />\n\n==== Beach break ====\nA beach break happens where waves break from offshore waves, and onshore sandbars and rips. Wave breaks happen successively at beach breaks. Example locations are Tairua and Aramoana Beach (New Zealand) and the Gold Coast (Australia).<ref name=Scarfe2009 />\n\n==== River or estuary entrance bar ====\nA river or estuary entrance bar creates waves from the ebb tidal delta, sediment outflow, and tidal currents. An ideal estuary entrance bar exists in Whangamata Bar, New Zealand.<ref name=Scarfe2009 />\n\n==== Reef break ====\nA reef break is conducive to surfing because large waves consistently break over the reef. The reef is usually made of coral, and because of this, many injuries occur while surfing reef breaks. However, the waves that are produced by reef breaks are some of the best in the world. Famous reef breaks are present in Padang Padang (Indonesia), Pipeline (Hawaii), Uluwatu (Bali), and Teahupo'o (Tahiti).<ref name=Scarfe2009 /><ref>{{cite web|last1=HURT|first1=GAREK|title=THE DIFFERENCES BETWEEN BEACH BREAKS, POINT BREAKS, AND REEF BREAKS|url=https://www.degree33surfboards.com/blogs/gettin-pitted/14071029-the-differences-between-beach-breaks-point-breaks-and-reef-breaks|website=Degree 33 Surfboards|accessdate=26 November 2017}}</ref> When surfing a reef break, the depth of the water needs to be considered as surfboards have fins on the bottom of the board. \n\n==== Ledge break ====\nA ledge break is formed by steep rocks ledges that makes intense waves because the waves travel through deeper water then abruptly reach shallower water at the ledge. Shark Island, Australia is a location with a ledge break. Ledge breaks create difficult surfing conditions, sometimes only allowing body surfing as the only feasible way to confront the waves.<ref name=Scarfe2009 />\n\n=== Jetties and their impacts on wave formation in the surf zone ===\n[[Jetty|Jetties]] are added to bodies of water to regulate erosion, preserve navigation channels, and make harbors. Jetties are classified into four different types and have two main controlling variables: the type of delta and the size of the jetty.<ref name=Scarfe2003>{{cite journal |last1= Scarfe |first1=B.E. |author2=M.H.S. Elwany, K.P. Black, and S.T. Mead |title=Categorizing the Types of Surfing Breaks around Jetty Structures |url=http://escholarship.org/uc/item/09f405bq |journal=Scripps Institution of Oceanography Technical Report |date=7 March 2003 |pages=1\u20138}}</ref>\n\n==== Type 1 jetty ====\nThe first classification is a type 1 jetty. This type of jetty is significantly longer than the surf zone width and the waves break at the shore end of the jetty. The effect of a Type 1 jetty is sediment accumulation in a wedge formation on the jetty. These waves are large and increase in size as they pass over the sediment wedge formation. An example of a Type 1 jetty is Mission Beach, San Diego, California. This 1000-meter jetty was installed in 1950 at the mouth of Mission Bay. The surf waves happen north of the jetty, are longer waves, and are powerful. The bathymetry of the sea bottom in Mission Bay has a wedge shape formation that causes the waves to refract as they become closer to the jetty.<ref name=Scarfe2003 /> The waves converge constructively after they refract and increase the sizes of the waves.\n\n==== Type 2 jetty ====\nA type 2 jetty occurs in an ebb tidal delta, a delta transitioning between high and low tide. This area has shallow water, refraction, and a distinctive seabed shapes that creates large wave heights.<ref name=Scarfe2003 />\n\nAn example of a type 2 jetty is called \"The Poles\" in Atlantic Beach, Florida. Atlantic Beach is known to have flat waves, with exceptions during major storms. However, \"The Poles\" has larger than normal waves due to a 500-meter jetty that was installed on the south side of the St. Johns. This jetty was built to make a deep channel in the river. It formed a delta at \"The Poles\". This is special area because the jetty increases wave size for surfing, when comparing pre-conditions and post-conditions of the southern St. Johns River mouth area.<ref name=Scarfe2003 />\n\nThe wave size at \"The Poles\" depends on the direction of the incoming water. When easterly waters (from 55\u00b0) interact with the jetty, they create waves larger than southern waters (from 100\u00b0). When southern waves (from 100\u00b0) move toward \"The Poles\", one of the waves breaks north of the southern jetty and the other breaks south of the jetty. This does not allow for merging to make larger waves. Easterly waves, from 55\u00b0, converge north of the jetty and unite to make bigger waves.<ref name=Scarfe2003 />\n\n==== Type 3 jetty ====\nA type 3 jetty is in an ebb tidal area with an unchanging seabed that has naturally created waves. Examples of a Type 3 jetty occurs in \u201cSouthside\u201d Tamarack, Carlsbad, California.<ref name=Scarfe2003 />\n\n==== Type 4 jetty ====\nA type 4 jetty is one that no longer functions nor traps sediment. The waves are created from  reefs in the surf zone. A type 4 jetty can be found in Tamarack, Carlsbad, California.<ref name=Scarfe2003 />\n\n=== Rip currents ===\n[[Rip current]]s are fast, narrow currents that are caused by onshore transport within the surf zone and the successive return of the water seaward.<ref name=Dalrymple1978 /><ref name=Smith1995 />  The wedge bathymetry makes a convenient and consistent rip current of 5\u201310 meters that brings the surfers to the \u201ctake off point\u201d then out to the beach.<ref name=Scarfe2003 />\n\nOceanographers have two theories on rip current formation. The wave interaction model assumes that two edges of waves interact, create differing wave heights, and cause longshore transport of nearshore currents. The Boundary Interaction Model assumes that the topography of the sea bottom causes nearshore circulation and longshore transport; the result of both models is a rip current.<ref name=Dalrymple1978>{{cite journal |last=Dalrymple |first=Robert A. |date=1978 |title=Rip Currents and Their Causes |url=https://journals.tdl.org/icce/index.php/icce/article/viewArticle/3345 |journal=Coastal Engineering |volume=1 |issue=16 |pages=1414\u20131427}}</ref>\n\nRip currents can be extremely strong and narrow as they extend out of the surf zone into deeper water, reaching speeds from {{convert|0.5|m/s|ft/s||abbr=on|sigfig=2}} and up to {{convert|2.5|m/s|ft/s||abbr=on|sigfig=2}},<ref name=Smith1995 /><ref name=Bowen1969 /> which is faster than any human can swim. The water in the jet is sediment rich, bubble rich, and moves rapidly.<ref name=Smith1995 /> The rip head of the rip current has long shore movement. Rip currents are common on beaches with mild slopes that experience sizeable and frequent oceanic swell.<ref name=Bowen1969>{{cite journal |last=Bowen |first=Anthony J. |date=1969 |title=Rip Currents: Theoretical Investigations |journal=Journal of Geophysical Research |volume=74 |issue=23 |pages=5467\u20135477 |doi=10.1029/JC074i023p05467 |bibcode=1969JGR....74.5467B |url=http://chinacat.coastal.udel.edu/cieg682/protect/bowen-jgr69.pdf |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100612115232/http://chinacat.coastal.udel.edu/cieg682/protect/bowen-jgr69.pdf |archive-date=12 June 2010 |df=dmy-all |citeseerx=10.1.1.463.6097 }}</ref>\n\nThe vorticity and inertia of rip currents have been studied. From a model of the vorticity of a rip current done at Scripps Institute of Oceanography, it was found that a fast rip current extends away from shallow water, the vorticity of the current increases, and the width of the current decreases.<ref name=Bowen1969 /><ref name=Arthur1962>{{cite journal |last=Arthur |first=Robert S. |date=1962 |title=A Note on the Dynamics of Rip Currents |journal=Journal of Geophysical Research |volume=67 |issue=7 |pages=2777\u20132779 |doi=10.1029/JZ067i007p02777 |bibcode=1962JGR....67.2777A}}</ref> This model also acknowledges that friction plays a role and waves are irregular in nature.<ref name=Arthur1962 /> From data from Sector-Scanning Doppler Sonar at Scripps Institute of Oceanography, it was found that rip currents in La Jolla, CA lasted several minutes, reoccurred one to four times per hour, and created a wedge with a 45\u00b0 arch and a radius 200\u2013400 meters.<ref name=Smith1995>{{cite journal |last1=Smith |first1=Jerome A. |author2=John L.

Longer boards are good for beginners who need help balancing. Smaller boards are good for more experienced surfers who want to have more control and maneuverability.<ref name=Edge2001 />\n\nWhen practicing the sport of surfing, the surfer paddles out past the wave break to wait for a wave. When a surfable wave arrives, the surfer must paddle extremely fast to match the velocity of the wave so the wave can accelerate him or her.<ref name=Edge2001 />\n\nWhen the surfer is at wave speed, the surfer must quickly pop up, stay low, and stay toward the front of the wave to become stable and prevent falling as the wave steepens. The acceleration is less toward the front than toward the back. The physics behind the surfing of the wave involves the horizontal acceleration force (F\u00b7sin\u03b8) and the vertical force (F\u00b7cos\u03b8=mg). Therefore, the surfer should lean forward to gain speed, and lean on the back foot to brake. Also, to increase the length of the ride of the wave, the surfer should travel parallel to the wave crest.<ref name=Edge2001 />\n\n== Notable locations ==\n* See [[:Category:Surfing locations]]\n\n==Dangers==\n\n===Drowning===\nSurfing, like all water sports, carries the inherent risk of [[drowning]].<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://hvsboardsport.com/dangerous-aspects-surfing/|title=Is Surfing Dangerous?|date=1 January 2018|work=HVS Boarsport|access-date=1 January 2018|language=en-US}}</ref> Anyone at any age can learn to surf, but should have at least intermediate swimming skills.

A fallen rider's board can become trapped in larger waves, and if the rider is attached by a leash, he or she can be dragged for long distances underwater.<ref name=\"ridinggiants\" /> Surfers should be careful to remain in smaller surf until they have acquired the advanced skills and experience necessary to handle bigger waves and more challenging conditions.

Under the wrong circumstances these currents can endanger both experienced and inexperienced surfers. Since a rip current appears to be an area of flat water, tired or inexperienced swimmers or surfers may enter one and be carried out beyond the breaking waves. Although many rip currents are much smaller, the largest rip currents have a width of forty or fifty feet. However, by paddling parallel to the shore, a surfer can easily exit a rip current. Alternatively, some surfers actually ride on a rip current because it is a fast and effortless way to get out beyond the zone of breaking waves.<ref>\n{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/1530767.stm | work=BBC News | title=Surfing's hidden dangers | date=7 September 2001 | accessdate=24 May 2010}}</ref>\n\n===Seabed===\nThe [[seabed]] can pose a risk for surfers. If a surfer falls while riding a wave, the wave tosses and tumbles the surfer around, often in a downwards direction. At reef breaks and beach breaks, surfers have been seriously injured and even killed, because of a violent collision with the sea bed, the water above which can sometimes be very shallow, especially at beach breaks or reef breaks during low tide. Cyclops, [[Western Australia]], for example, is one of the biggest and thickest reef breaks in the world, with waves measuring up to {{convert|10|m|ft|abbr=on|sigfig=2}} high, but the [[reef]] below is only about {{convert|2|m|ft|abbr=on|sigfig=1}} below the surface of the water.\n\n===Microorganisms===\n{{Wikinews|British surfers catch more than waves: Scientists find antibiotic-resistant bacteria}}\nA January 2018 study by the [[University of Exeter]] called the \"Beach Bum Survey\" found surfers and bodyboarders to be three times as likely as non-surfers to harbor [[antibiotic-resistant]] ''[[E. coli]]'' and four times as likely to harbor other bacteria capable of easily becoming antibiotic resistant.

Surfer's ear is where the bone near the ear canal grows after repeated exposure to cold water, making the ear canal narrower. The narrowed canal makes it harder for water to drain from the ear. This can result in pain, infection and sometimes ringing of the ear. If surfer's ear develops it does so after repeated surfing sessions. Yet, damage such as inflammation of the ear can occur after only surfing once. This can be caused by repeatedly falling off the surfboard into the water and having the cold water rush into the ears, which can exert a damaging amount of pressure. Those with sensitive ears should therefore wear ear protection, even if they are not planning to surf very often.<ref>\n{{cite news| url=https://magicseaweed.com/news/surfers-ear-an-inconvenient-truth/6276/| work=MSW | title=Surfer's Ear \u2013 An Inconvenient Truth | date=4 April 2014 | accessdate=15 July 2018}}</ref>\n\nEar plugs designed for surfers, swimmers and other water athletes are primarily made to keep water out of the ear, thereby letting a protective pocket of air stay inside the ear canal. They can also block cold air, dirt and bacteria. Many designs are made to let sound through, and either float and/or have a leash in case the plug accidentally gets bumped out.<ref>[https://www.surfertoday.com/surfing/the-best-ear-plugs-for-surfers SurferToday.com | The Ultimate Surfing News Website | The best ear plugs for surfers]</ref><ref>[https://www.overthedune.com/wear-ear-plugs-when-surf/  Wear earplugs when you surf - Over The Dune | Get Surfing]</ref>\n\n=== Eye damage ===\n[[File:Seal Swim Goggles.jpg|thumb|right|SealMask watersport [[goggles]] made by AquaSphere]]\n[[Surfer's eye]] (''Pterygium (conjunctiva)'') is a gradual tissue growth on the cornea of the eye which ultimately can lead to vision loss. The cause of the condition is unclear, but appears to be partly related to long term exposure to UV light, dust and wind exposure. Prevention may include wearing sunglasses and a hat if in an area with strong sunlight. Surfers and other water-sport athletes should therefore wear eye protection that blocks 100% of the UV rays from the water, as is often used by snow-sport athletes. Surf goggles often have a head strap and ventilation to avoid fogging<ref>[http://www.wearsurfglasses.com/ Sunglasses for Surfing and other Water Sports]</ref><ref>[https://www.sportviz.co.uk/surf_cores Sportviz Custom Affordable Surf Masks]</ref>\n\nUsers of contact lenses should take extra care, and may consider wearing surfing goggles. Some risks of exposing contact lenses to the elements that can cause eye damage or infections are sand or organisms in the sea water getting between the eye and contact lens, or that lenses might fold.<ref>[https://www.surferdad.co.uk/surf-goggles Surfer Dad | Surf blog - Surf Goggles]</ref><ref>[http://mellow-waves.com/should-you-surf-with-contact-lenses/ Should you surf with contact lenses? | Mellow Waves]</ref>\n\n=== Spinal cord ===\n[[Surfer's myelopathy]] is a rare spinal cord injury causing paralysis of the lower extremities, caused by hyperextension of the back.
