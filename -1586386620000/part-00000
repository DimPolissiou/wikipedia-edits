Benfica|Sport Lisboa e Benfica]] is a Portuguese professional [[association football|football]] club based in [[Lisbon]], whose involvement in European competition dates back to the 1950s. As [[1954\u201355 Primeira Divis\u00e3o|champions of Portugal]], Benfica were supposed to participate in the [[1955\u201356 European Cup|inaugural edition]] of the [[UEFA Champions League|European Cup]] in 1955, but they were not invited by the organizers. Two years later, they made their European debut against [[Sevilla FC|Sevilla]] in the European Cup, on 19 September 1957.\n\nBenfica won their first European title in [[1961 European Cup Final|1961]], defeating [[FC Barcelona|Barcelona]] to win the European Cup, and successfully retained the title in [[1962 European Cup Final|the following year]] after defeating [[Real Madrid C.F.|Real Madrid]]. After that, they appeared in five more finals \u2013 [[1962\u201363 European Cup|1963]], [[1965 European Cup Final|'65]], [[1968 European Cup Final|'68]], [[1988 European Cup Final|'88]] and [[1990 European Cup Final|'90]] \u2013 but failed to reconquer the title. These consecutive final losses have been attributed to a famous [[Sports-related curses|curse]] by Hungarian manager [[B\u00e9la Guttmann]] in 1962. Benfica have also played in three [[UEFA Europa League|UEFA Cup/UEFA Europa League]] finals \u2013 [[1983 UEFA Cup Final|1983]], [[2013 UEFA Europa League Final|2013]] and [[2014 UEFA Europa League Final|'14]] \u2013 losing all three.\n\nWith 2 titles, Benfica are the second most decorated Portuguese team in [[UEFA competitions]], and hold the Portuguese record for most appearances in [[UEFA Competitions' finals|UEFA competitions' finals]], with 10 appearances. Additionally, the 39 participations in the Champions League (formerly the European Cup) are only surpassed by Real Madrid and they occupy, as of 11 March 2020, the eighh place at the [[European Cup and UEFA Champions League records and statistics#All-time top 25 European Champion Clubs' Cup and Champions League rankings|competition's all-time ranking]]. \n\nBenfica's biggest European win is 10\u20130, which came against [[Stade Dudelange]] of Luxembourg for the [[1965\u201366 European Cup]], and their 18\u20130 aggregate win constitutes a European Cup record. Brazilian defender [[Luis\u00e3o]] holds the club record for appearances in Europe, with 124 matches, while former Portuguese striker [[Eus\u00e9bio]] is the club's leading European goalscorer, with 56 goals. \n\n==Background==\n{{Further|UEFA competitions}}\nThe first continental competition organised by [[UEFA]] was the [[UEFA Champions League|European Cup]] in 1955. Conceived by [[Gabriel Hanot]], the editor of ''[[L'\u00c9quipe]]'', as a competition for winners of the European national football leagues, it is considered the most prestigious European football competition.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.uefa.com/uefachampionsleague/history/index.html|title=Football's premier club competition|website=[[UEFA]]|access-date=25 December 2011}}</ref> That year, Benfica had won the [[1954\u201355 Primeira Divis\u00e3o|Primeira Divis\u00e3o]], but the competition organizers selected [[Sporting CP]] to take part in the first edition.<ref name=\"1st edition\">{{cite web|title=50 years of European Cup|url=https://www.uefa.com/newsfiles/240459.pdf#page=6|website=[[UEFA]]|date=October 2004|pages=6\u20137|access-date=8 May 2016}}</ref> Another club competition, the [[Inter-Cities Fairs Cup]], was established in 1955 and contested in parallel with the European Cup. It eventually came under the auspices of UEFA in 1971, which rebranded it to [[UEFA Europa League|UEFA Cup]].

In the following years, UEFA created additional club competitions. The first, the [[UEFA Cup Winners' Cup|Cup Winners' Cup]], was inaugurated in 1960 for the winners of domestic cup competitions. Established in 1973, the [[UEFA Super Cup]] was originally a match played between the winners of the European Cup and the Cup Winners' Cup. Since 2000, it has been contested by the winners of the Champions League (formerly the European Cup) and the Europa League (formerly the UEFA Cup).<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.uefa.com/uefasupercup/history/index.html|title=Club competition winners do battle|website=[[UEFA]]|access-date=2 September 2011}}</ref>\n\nThe [[Intercontinental Cup (football)|Intercontinental Cup]] was a competition for the winners of the European Cup (the later UEFA Champions League) and its South American equivalent, the [[Copa Libertadores]]. Established in 1960, the Intercontinental Cup was jointly organised by UEFA and the [[CONMEBOL|Confederaci\u00f3n Sudamericana de F\u00fatbol]] (CONMEBOL).

Benfica|Sport Lisboa e Benfica]] is a Portuguese professional [[association football|football]] club based in [[Lisbon]], whose involvement in European competition dates back to the 1950s. As [[1954\u201355 Primeira Divis\u00e3o|champions of Portugal]], Benfica were supposed to participate in the [[1955\u201356 European Cup|inaugural edition]] of the [[UEFA Champions League|European Cup]] in 1955, but they were not invited by the organizers. Two years later, they made their European debut against [[Sevilla FC|Sevilla]] in the European Cup, on 19 September 1957.\n\nBenfica won their first European title in [[1961 European Cup Final|1961]], defeating [[FC Barcelona|Barcelona]] to win the European Cup, and successfully retained the title in [[1962 European Cup Final|the following year]] after defeating [[Real Madrid C.F.|Real Madrid]]. After that, they appeared in five more finals \u2013 [[1962\u201363 European Cup|1963]], [[1965 European Cup Final|'65]], [[1968 European Cup Final|'68]], [[1988 European Cup Final|'88]] and [[1990 European Cup Final|'90]] \u2013 but failed to reconquer the title. These consecutive final losses have been attributed to a famous [[Sports-related curses|curse]] by Hungarian manager [[B\u00e9la Guttmann]] in 1962.

It lies on the River [[Radbuza]], some {{convert|40|km|mi|0|abbr=on}} south-west of the region capital [[Plze\u0148]]. From 1938 to 1945 it was, as Bischofteinitz, one of the [[municipalities in Sudetenland]].\n\n==History==\nA settlement on the right bank of the Radbuza river was first established in the mid-13th century, on land owned by the archbishops of [[Prague]]. The town was besieged and defended during the [[Hussite]] wars between 1422 and 1431. The German Elector [[John, Count Palatine of Neumarkt]] (''Johann von Pfalz-Neumarkt'') helped relieve the town.\n\nAfter the death of [[Louis II of Hungary]] at the [[Battle of Moh\u00e1cs]] in 1526, Archduke [[Ferdinand I, Holy Roman Emperor|Ferdinand]] of [[Austria]] became King of [[Bohemia]] and the country became a constituent state of the [[Habsburg Monarchy]] to 1918.\n\nAfter 1539 Bischofteinitz belonged to the [[House of Lobkowicz]]. After the [[Thirty Years War]] the town passed to the counts on [[Trauttmansdorff]], in whose possession the castle remained until 1945. Bischofteinitz developed into an important, if minor, provincial centre bordering [[Bavaria]].\n\nDuring the late 19th century and especially after 1918 [[Czechs]] began moving into the district in large numbers. In 1938 the town and region were annexed into [[Nazi Germany]] as part of the [[Sudetenland]].\n\nUntil 1945 the area was populated by native [[Germans]] who spoke a Northern Bavarian dialect (''Nordbairisch''). These people were [[Expulsion of Germans from Czechoslovakia|expelled]] by the [[Bene\u0161 decrees]] following [[World War II]].

It lies on the River [[Radbuza]], some {{convert|40|km|mi|0|abbr=on}} south-west of the region capital [[Plze\u0148]]. From 1938 to 1945 it was, as Bischofteinitz, one of the [[municipalities in Sudetenland]].\n\n==History==\nA settlement on the right bank of the Radbuza river was first established in the mid-13th century, on land owned by the archbishops of [[Prague]]. The town was besieged and defended during the [[Hussite]] wars between 1422 and 1431. The German Elector [[John, Count Palatine of Neumarkt]] (''Johann von Pfalz-Neumarkt'') helped relieve the town.\n\nAfter the death of [[Louis II of Hungary]] at the [[Battle of Moh\u00e1cs]] in 1526, Archduke [[Ferdinand I, Holy Roman Emperor|Ferdinand]] of [[Austria]] became King of [[Bohemia]] and the country became a constituent state of the [[Habsburg Monarchy]] to 1918.\n\nAfter 1539 Bischofteinitz belonged to the [[House of Lobkowicz]]. After the [[Thirty Years War]] the town passed to the counts on [[Trauttmansdorff]], in whose possession the castle remained until 1945. Bischofteinitz developed into an important, if minor, provincial centre bordering [[Bavaria]].\n\nDuring the late 19th century and especially after 1918 [[Czechs]] began moving into the district in large numbers. In 1938 the town and region were annexed into [[Nazi Germany]] as part of the [[Sudetenland]].\n\nUntil 1945 the area was populated by native [[Germans]] who spoke a Northern Bavarian dialect (''Nordbairisch''). These people were [[Expulsion of Germans from Czechoslovakia|expelled]] by the [[Bene\u0161 decrees]] following [[World War II]].

The vast oceans between the U.S and the enemy on both sides made the [[Military logistics|logistics]] of war a major concern. [[Ben Moreell|Rear Admiral Moreell]] completely understood the issues at hand.  What needed to be done was build staging bases and create a military construction force to do build them to take the war to the enemy.  The concept of Naval Construction Battalions had been slowly developing at [[Naval Facilities Engineering Command]] [[Bureau of Yards and Docks]] (BuDocks) in the 1930s.  The onset of war clarified to Moreell the need to be able to develop advance bases to project American power.  The solution was to tap the United States vast pool of skilled labor. Put it in uniform to build anything, anywhere under any conditions and get the Marine Corps to train them. The first volunteers were skilled recruits at enlistment. To obtain these men, military age limits were modified to take 18\u201350 years old.  It was later found that several past 60 had managed to get in. Men were given advanced rank/pay based upon experience making the Seabees the highest paid group in the U.S. military.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://web.mst.edu/~rogersda/umrcourses/ge342/SeaBees-Revised.pdf |first=J.

For the next year Seabees were picked by the [[Selective Service System]].  Recruits were younger and came with only basic skills.\"<ref name=\"CBHistory\" />  To address this issue the Seabees created training programs in more than 60 skilled trades.

[[Rear Admiral]] [[Ben Moreell]], CEC, USN, became Chief of the Bureau of Yards and Docks (BUDOCKS) in 1937. Congress therefore authorized the expansion of naval Shore Activities, which included construction in the Caribbean and by 1939 in the Central Pacific. \"Following standard peacetime guidelines the Navy awarded these contracts to civilian constructions firms. These contractors employed native civilian populations as well as U.S citizens and were answerable to naval officers in charge of construction. By 1941 large U.S. naval bases were being built on Guam, Midway, Wake, Pearl Harbor, Iceland, Newfoundland, Bermuda, and Trinidad to name a few.\"<ref name=\"NHHC\">{{cite web|title=Seabee History: Introduction|publisher=Naval History and Heritage Command|date=Feb 17, 2017|url=https://www.history.navy.mil/content/history/nhhc/research/library/online-reading-room/title-list-alphabetically/s/seabee-history0/seabee-history.html}}</ref> International law, dictated civilians not to resist enemy military attacks.

The first three Battalions were formed in the first month. Enlistment was voluntary until December 1942, when the [[Selective Service System]] became responsible for all recruitment.

BuDocks deemed it essential that CBs be commanded by [[Civil Engineer Corps]] (CEC) officers trained in the skills required for the execution of construction projects.<ref name=\"BBWWII\" />  The [[Bureau of Naval Personnel]] strongly objected to this violation of Naval tradition.<ref name=\"BBWWII\" /> Admiral Moreell took the issue directly to the Secretary of the Navy.<ref name=\"BBWWII\" /> On March 19th the Secretary gave the CEC authority to command all officers and enlisted assigned to naval construction units and granted the CEC command status for combat operations.<ref name=\"BBWWII\"/>With CBs authorized and the command question settled,  BuDocks then had to deal with recruitment and training.  Following that was deciding the military organization structure and organizing the logistical support necessary to make everything work. This all happened quickly.  Due to the exigencies of war there was a great deal of \"improvisation\", a quality that became synonymous with Seabees in general.<ref name=CBHISTORY/>\n\n\"At Naval Construction Training Centers (CTC) and Advanced Base Depots (ABD) on both coasts, Seabees learned: trade skills, military discipline, and advanced combat training. Although technically designated \"support\", Seabees frequently found themselves under fire with the Marines.  After completing boot training at [[Camp Allen]] VA. and later [[Camp Peary]] VA, the men were formed into CBs or other smaller CB units. The first four battalions were deployed immediately upon completion of recruit training due to the backlog of construction projects. Battalions that followed were sent to an ABDs at either [[Davisville, Rhode Island]], or [[Port Hueneme, California]] to be staged, outfitted, and trained prior to shipping out.  Basic military training was done by the Navy while the [[United States Marine Corps|Marine Corps]] provided [[United States Marine Corps School of Infantry|advanced military training]] at Camp Peary, Camp Lejeune or Camp Pendelton.  About 175,000 Seabees were staged out of Port Hueneme during the war.  Units that had seen extended service in the Pacific were returned to the [[R&R (military)|R&R]] Center at [[Camp Parks]], Shoemaker, CA. At Camp Parks units were reorganized, re-deployed or [[Demobilization|decommissioned]]. Men were given 30-day leaves and later, those eligible were discharged. The same was done at the ABD Receiving Barracks [[Davisville, Rhode Island]], for the east coast.\"<ref name=\"CBHistory\">{{cite report|title=History of the Seabees, Command Historian, Naval Facilities Engineering Command|year=1996|page=13|url=https://health.mil/Reference-Center/Publications/1996/01/01/History-of-the-Seabees-Command|access-date=2019-12-13}}</ref>\n\n===CB rates===\n<ref>{{cite web |url=https://bluejacket.com/usn_ratings.html |title=U.S. Navy Enlisted Rating Structure |website=bluejacket.com |accessdate=18 October 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|title=U.S. Naval Construction Battalions, Administration Manual |date=January 1944 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=R610ZqnWj9AC&pg=SL24-PA70 |publisher= |pages=27\u201330 |accessdate=18 October 2017 |via=google books}}</ref>  These indicate the construction trade in which a Seabee is skilled.

Each company could do smaller jobs independently as they each had all the basic ratings for doing any job.  Hq.

The standard battalion complement was set at 32 officers and 1,073 enlisted.\n\n\"By 1944 construction projects grew in scope and scale.  Often more than one CB was assigned to a job. To promote efficient administrative control 3-4 battalions would be organized into a regiment, if necessary, two or more regiments were organized into a brigade. An example of this was Okinawa where 55,000 Seabees were organized into regiments and brigades. All were under the Commander, Construction Troops,  Commodore Andrew G. Bisset (CEC).  Additionally, he commanded 45,000 U.S. Army engineers making Okinawa the largest concentration of construction troops ever.\"<ref name=\"CBHistory\" />\n\nThe overall total construction cost of Seabee projects was $11 billion.  At wars end they would number over 258,000. The NCF grew into 12 Naval Construction Brigades of: 54 Naval Construction Regiments, 151 Naval Construction Battalions, 39 Special Construction Battalions, 136 CB Maintaince Units, 118 CB Detachments, and 5 Pontoon Assembly Detachments.{{sfn|Rottman|2008|pages= 31\u201332}} In addition, many Seabees had served outside the NCF in [[Naval Combat Demolition Units]] (NCDU)s, [[Underwater Demolition Teams]](UDT)s, Cubs, Lions Acorns and United States [[Marine Corps]].\n\nWhile the CB itself was versatile it was apparent that some units could be smaller and/or specialized for task specific units.  \"The first departure from the standard CB was the \"Special\" Construction Battalion, or the \"CB Special\". \"Special\" CBs were composed of [[stevedores]] and [[longshoremen]] who were badly needed for the unloading of cargo in combat zones. Many officers for \"Specials\" were recruited from the [[Merchant Marine]] (and commissioned as CEC) while stevedoring companies were the source of many of the enlisted. Soon, the efficiency of cargo handling in combat zones was on a par to that found in the most efficient ports in the U.S.\"<ref name=\"CBHistory\" />  There were five battalions specialized in pontoons, barges, and causeways: 70th, 81st, 111th, 128th, 302nd.{{sfn |last= Rottman| 2002|page=31}  The 134th & 139th CBs were made trucking units due to the transportation and logistic needs on Guam and Okinawa.\n\n\"Several different types of smaller, specialized units were created. Construction Battalion Maintenance Units/CBMUs, a quarter the size of a CB were one. They were Public Works units intended to assume base maintenance of newly constructed bases.  Another unit type was the Construction Battalion Detachment/CBD, of  6 to 600 men. CBDs did everything from running tire-repair shops to operating [[dredges]]. Many were tasked with the handling, launching, assembly, installation of pontoon causeways.  Others were petroleum dets specializing in [[pipeline transport|pipelines]] or [[Oil terminal|petroleum facilities]]).\"<ref name=\"CBHistory\" />\n\nThe \"Seabee\" logo in use today was created by Frank J. Iafrate, a file clerk employed at the [[Camp Endicott]], [[Quonset Point]], [[Rhode Island]]. Iafrate was known for his caricature drawings.  A lieutenant asked Iafrate if he could draw a \"[[Disney]] style\" insignia for the new Naval force. After brainstorming ideas,  the bee became his choice. Bees are the epitome of industry, hard work, and don't trouble others unless bothered first.  He spent three hours on a Sunday afternoon sketching.  He added the sailor's cap along with petty officer rank and the tools of the machinist mate's, carpenter's mate, and gunner's mate.  On each wrist he placed the CEC insignia above the glove. For a border he set the image inside a letter Q for Quonset Point. The next day he gave it to the lieutenant, who showed it to his captain, who sent it off to RADM. Moreell in Washington.  All RADM. Moreell requested was that Iafrate change the border from a Q to a hawser \"rope\" in keeping with Naval tradition for Naval insignia.<ref>{{cite web|url = http://www.nsva.org/Seabee%20Orgin.htm|title = The Origin of the Seabees|accessdate = May 20, 2014|website = NSVA.org|publisher = Navy Seabee Veterans of America, Inc.|url-status = dead|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20131026120526/http://nsva.org/Seabee%20Orgin.htm|archivedate = October 26, 2013}}</ref>\n\n=== The Atlantic theater ===\n[[File:Omaha Mulberry Harbour.jpg|thumb|A [[Mulberry_harbour#Whales|\"Whale\"]] roadway leading to a Spud pier at [[Mulberry harbour|Mulberry]] A off [[Omaha Beach]]]]\n[[File:US Army vehicles rolling off Mulberry A 16 June 1944.jpg|thumb|U.S. Army vehicles transit a floating causeway built by U.S. Navy Seabees off \"Mulberry A\" at Omaha Beach in June 1944]]\n\n\"When the U.S. found itself in a two ocean war, the Panama Canal became a strategic point. The convergence of shipping lanes necessitated forming bases to protect the approaches to the canal.  Agreements around the Caribbean made it possible to secure sites as needed. The [[Lend Lease Agreement]] with [[Great Britain]] also made sites available while existing bases were enlarged. Under the Greenslade Program naval bases in [[Puerto Rico]], [[Cuba]], and the [[Panama Canal]] Zone were all expanded. The construction program undertaken in Puerto Rico was ambitious. [[Naval Station Roosevelt Roads]] was turned into the \"[[Pearl Harbor]] of the Caribbean.  Construction on existing bases was done primarily by civilian contractors until late 1943.  Then CBs took over any unfinished projects. In the Atlantic the bases formed a line from [[Bermuda]] to Brazil. On the Pacific side of the Americas the U.S had bases from the [[Honduras]] to [[Ecuador]]. <ref name=\"NAVBASESoAm\">{{cite book|chapter-url=http://www.ibiblio.org/hyperwar/USN/Building_Bases/bases-18.html|chapter=Chapter XVIII: Bases in South America and the Caribbean Area, Including Bermuda|title={{harvp|Building the Navy's Bases in World War II}}: \u2026 Volume II|via=HyperWar}}</ref>  The 80th(colored) CB upgraded Carlson airfield on [[Trinidad]].

While not in combat zones they were necessary to the overall war effort.\"<ref name=\"NAVBASESoAm\" />\n\n\"[[North Africa]] was the Seabees first combat in the Atlantic.  Landing with the assault in November 1942, Seabees built facilities at [[Oran]], [[Casablanca]], [[Sifi]] and [[Fedala]]. Later they would build a string of staging and training areas along the [[Mediterranean]] including [[NAS Port Lyautey]], [[Morocco]].\"<ref name=CBHISTORY/>\n\n\"Once Tunisia was taken the Seabees began a buildup at [[Bizerte]]. There they prepped steel pontoon boxes for their first use in combat at Sicily. This Seabee \"innovation\" was adapted for amphibious warfare. A pontoon box was standardized in size so multiple pontoons could be quickly assembled like to form causeways, piers, or rhinos.  As such they could be used to meet the exigencies of amphibious warfare. The beaches of [[Sicily]] were considered impossible  for an amphibious landing by both the Allies and Axis.  The Seabees with their pontoons proved that was not true. The Germans were overwhelmed by the men and material that poured ashore over pontoon causeways.<ref name=CBHISTORY/>\n\n\"Seabee causeways were used again at [[Salerno]] and [[Anzio]]. The Germans were prepared causing heavy casualties at both. Seabees moving supplies and ammo across their causeways were amongst them. For many months Seabees remained at Anzio under continuous German fire. When [[Southern Italy]] finally fell the Seabees had one more Mediterranean task in [[Operation Dragoon]] at [[Toulon]].\"<ref name=CBHISTORY/>\n\n\"Seabee operations in the [[North Atlantic]] begun early 1942.  The first projects were in [[Iceland]], [[Newfoundland]], and [[Greenland]] at bases acquired from Great Britain.  These installations provided airfields and ports to protect [[Battle of the Atlantic|Allied convoys]] in the North Atlantic. To complete a defense line across the North Atlantic, Seabees were sent to the UK. [[Port of Londonderry|Londonderry]], [[Northern Ireland]], [[Lough Erne]], [[Loch Ryan]], and [[Rosneath]] in [[Scotland]] were transformed into depots, tank farms, and seaplane bases.  Once completed the Seabees moved to prepare for [[Operation Overlord]]. From [[Milford Haven]] in  [[Wales]] to [[Plymouth]] and over to [[Exeter]], the Seabees built invasion bases and prepared for their most critical and multifaceted role in the Atlantic.\"<ref name=CBHISTORY/>\n\nD-Day Normandy found Seabees amongst the first ashore as [[Naval Combat Demolition Units]] (NCDU) along with the Army's Engineers. Their task was to remove beach obstacles built to impede amphibious landings.<ref name=CBHISTORY/>\n\n\"NCDUs came under very heavy German fire. Ignoring danger NCDUs worked until all their charges were placed and detonated. The result created gaps in the obstacles allowing the landing to progress. Once the invasion fleet arrived off the coast, the 10,000 Seabees of Naval Construction Regiment 25 began placeing their pontoon causeways. It was over these causeways that the invasion force went ashore to reach the gaps.\"<ref name=CBHISTORY/>\n\nAnother Seabee contribution was their Rhinos. [[Rhino ferry|Rhino ferries]] were a motorized or towed variation of the modular pontoon boxes. With them vast amounts of men and material were ferried ashore.  Seabees also assembled the offshore [[piers]], and [[breakwaters] into [[Mulberry A]] for the American sector.  It was to provide a port until French ports were captured and brought back into use. Even after the harbor destroyed by a storm the Seabees continued to landed thousands of tons supplies daily. In the first 28 days they were responsible for thousands of troops getting ashore.<ref name=CBHISTORY/>\n\n\"The [[Battle of Cherbourg|liberation of Cherbourg]] and [[Operation Astonia|Le Havre]] provided CBs major projects. Those harbors were very much needed by the Allies. Foreseeing this the Germans had left them in ruins.  At Cherbourg the first cargo landed within 11 days of the Seabees arrival and within a month the harbor was handling 14 ships at a time. Seabees made the same thing happen at Le Havre and again at [[Brest, France|Brest]], [[Lorient]], and [[St. Nazaire]].\"<ref name=CBHISTORY/>\n\n\"The last Seabee project in Europe was the [[Operation Lumberjack|crossing of the Rhine]].  The U.S. Army called for Seabees to do the job.  The first crossing was at [[Bad Neuenahr]] near [[Remagen]]. More followed quickly  as the Seabees made the task look easy. On 22 March 1945, General [[George S. Patton]], put his armor across at [[Oppenheim]]. Seabees used pontoon ferries to get the job done. In all, they had more than 300 craft shuttling troops and armor across. One crew even ferried Prime Minister [[Winston Churchill]].\"<ref name=CBHISTORY/>\n\n\"The 69th was the only CB to serve in Germany.  They also were the first CB to be deployed by air when they were flown from England to [[Bremen]] in April 1945. The battalion set up camp just outside the city. Their task was to repair damaged buildings and power lines for use by the U.S. occupation force. A detachment was sent to the nearby port of [[Bremerhaven]] make it operational for the Allies.  Another detachment was sent to [[Frankfurt-am-Main]] to refurbish buildings for the Hq of the U.S. Navy in Germany.  By August 1945 the battalion had returned to England ending the Seabees Atlantic story.\"<ref name=CBHISTORY/>\n\n=== The Pacific theater ===\n[[File:B-29s Landing on Tinian 1944.jpg|thumb|B-29s Landing on Tinian 1944]]\n[[File:USMC Photo Nh-97250.jpg|thumb|[[Type A K\u014d-hy\u014dteki-class submarine]] two-man sub salvaged by 6th CB off Tassafaronga Point.]]\n[[File:\"34th CB's trading with natives from Malaita.

Their deeds were unparalleled in history.   With 80 percent of the NCF in the Pacific, they literally built the road to V-J-day with: 111 major airstrips, 441 piers, 2,558 ammunition magazines, 700 square blocks of warehouses, hospitals to for 70,000 patients, fuel tanks for 100 million gallons, and barracks for 1.5 million men. They would serve on over 300 islands.\"<ref name=CBHISTORY/>\n\n\"From the onset, the entire Pacific, including [[Alaska]] and the [[Aleutian Islands Campaign|Aleutians]] were Japanese targets. Japanese operations of 1942, took the islands of Attu and Kiska.  Seabees sent to the [[North Pacific|North]] were there to help forestall what appeared at the time to be a major Japanese offensive.  By late June 1942 they had begun bases on [[Adak Island|Adak]] and [[Amchitka]] in the Aleutians.  They would serve as a deterrent for the remainder of the war.\"<ref name=CBHISTORY/>\n\n\"The first CB projects were on [[Bora Bora]] where the 1st CB Detachment arrived February 1942. The det took the name \"Bobcats\" from the Operation's code name BOBCAT (they had departed the U.S. so quickly that the \"Seabee\" name did not exist). Their task was to construct a fuel depot for ships and planes enroute to Australia. The Bobcats learned of many tropical issues: persistent precipitation, 50 types of [[dysentery]], numerous [[Tropical skin disease|skin diseases]], and the dreaded [[elephantiasis]]. These all combined to make conditions miserable and were harbingers of what was awaiting Seabees else-wheres. From the start their task was difficult, despite this there was satisfaction when the island's tank farms supported [[Task Force 44]] for the [[Battle of the Coral Sea]].\"<ref name=CBHISTORY/>\n\n\"While the Bobcats were in transit to Bora Bora the 2nd and 3rd CB Dets were formed. The 2nd CB Det was sent to [[Tongatapu]] in the [[Tonga Islands]] while the 3rd CB Det went to [[Efate]] in the [[New Hebrides]].  Both islands were also on routes to Australia. . \nBases built on them would support actions in the Coral Sea and the [[Guadalcanal Campaign|Solomon Islands]]. [[Espiritu Santo]] in the [[New Hebrides]] became strategic when the Japanese took [[Guadalcanal]], the southern most point of their expansion.  Destruction of Japanese airfields nearing completion on that island became imperative to stop further expansion.  The 3rd CB Det was rushed from Efate to Espiritu Santo to build a countermanding airfield asap. Within 20 days a 6000ft airstrip had been carved from the jungle.  When Marines made their assault Guadalcanal the 6th CB became the first CB to see combat. Their task was keeping Henderson Field operational.  The Japanese made this a never-ending job. As fast as it was repaired they would bomb it again.  The first Seabee to be decorated received a Silver Star for actions there.\"<ref name=CBHISTORY/>  \"The Marines made simultaneous landings on [[Guadalcanal]] and [[Tulagi Island]] with Seabees tasked to both.

CBs of the 7th Amphibious group built advance bases and depots from Australia and [[New Guinea]] through the [[Philippines]] to Okinawa.  The landing at [[Treasury Island]] became Seabee legend.  An 87th Seabee with a bulldozer took out a machine gun nest for a [[Silver Star]] there.\"<ref name=CBHISTORY/> By V-J Day NCF Seabees would be awarded 5 [[Navy Cross (United States)|Navy Crosses]], 33 Silver Stars, and over 2000 [[Purple Heart]]s.  Many would receive citations and commendations from the Matine Corps.  Seabees serving outside the NCF received numerous awards as well. Those in the UDTs would make Naval/Marine Corps awards History.  Admiral Turner put up over 60 officers for the Silver star and over 300 enlisted for the Bronze star with Vs.\n\n\"By mid-1943 at [[Merauke]], [[New Guinea]] Seabees built an air strip and comm station at [[Port Moresby]].  In December Seabees transferred to the 1st Marine Division landed at [[Battle of Cape Gloucester|Cape Gloucester]]. During the battle, Seabees of the 3rd Battalion [[19th Marines]] bulldozed paths to the Japanese lines so Marine tanks could attack.  They had to be told to hold up because they were so far beyond the lines.  By New Year's, the Marines had taken the enemy airfields on the Cape.\"<ref name=CBHISTORY/>\n\n\"Taking the [[Admiralty Islands|Admiralities]] became key to isolating [[Rabaul]] and the neutralizing of New Britain.  Seizure of [[Manus Island]] and [[Los Negros Island]] cut supplies from all points north and east. By 1944 Seabees had transformed those islands into the largest Lion and Oak in the Southwest Pacific.  It became the main supply and repair depot of the [[Seventh Fleet]]. The [[Landing on Emirau|capture of Emirau]] completed the encirclement of Rabaul.  A strategic two-field Oak, with depots, dry dock, and PT base was constructed there.\"<ref name=CBHISTORY/>\n\n\"[[Island hopping]] with Gen. [[Douglas MacArthur|MacArthur]] CBs reached [[Jayapura|Hollandia]] making it instrumental in the liberation of the Philippines. The 3rd Naval Construction Brigade was with MacArthur for return to [[Battle of Leyte|Leyte]]. Seabee pontoon barges and causeways brought MacArthur's Forces ashore.  Those Seabees were joined by the 2nd and 7th Naval Construction Brigades. This NCF totaled 37,000 and would turn the Philippines into a forward base for the assault on the Japan.  The 7th Fleet Hq was moved to the there with Seabees building everything required: fleet anchorages, sub bases, fleet repair facilities, fuel and supply depots, Pt bases and air stations.<ref name=CBHISTORY/>  At [[Dulag, Leyte]]  Seabee activity finally became a priority to the Japanese .  There the 61st CB had a detachment building a fighter strip come under aerial assault by Japanese [[paratroopers]].  The battle lasted 72 hours with the Japanese losing over 350 men.<ref>Seafoam, 61st CB cruisebook, 14 April, 1945, p. 46</ref> \n\n\"In the Central Pacific CBs we're both directly and indirectly involved in the fighting.  After landing in all the Marine assaults, CBs built the bases from which the U.S. moved relentlessly toward the Japanese homeland.  [[Tarawa Atoll|Tarawa]] in the Gilberts was bad, but in fifteen hours Seabees had the airfield operational.  They turned Majuro Atoll into one of the fleet's Lions and similarly transformed Kwajalein Atoll into a Oak.\"<ref name=CBHISTORY/>\n\n\"Seizure of the Marianas marked the beginning of the end. Their loss cut a Japanese line of defense.  More important, they placed Japan within range of U.S. bombers. During Operation \"Forager,\" Seabees made some of their most significant contributions in the Pacific landing with the Marines at [[ Battle of Kwajalein|Kwanjalein]],[[Battle of Saipan|Saipan]], [[Battle of Guam (1944)|Guam]], and [[Battle of Tinian|Tinian]]. The day the Marines captured [[Saipan International Airport|Aslito]] on Saipan, the Seabees went to work to get it operational in four days. During the battle for Guam,  CB Specials did stevedoring while others were combat engineers for the Marines.  When they were done CBs turned Guam into a Lion HQ for the fleet and an Oak for B-29s. The invasion of Tinian was a showcase of Seabee ingenuity and engineering. The CEC engineered detachable ramps mounted on [[Landing Vehicle Tracked|LVT-2s]] making landings possible where the Japanese thought it was impossible. Before the island was even secure, Seabees were completing an unfinished Japanese airfield.\"<ref name=CBHISTORY/>\n\n\"After the Marianas B-29s were in need of an emergency landing field and a forward base for fighter escorts. The island chosen was [[Iwo Jima]] which [[V Amphibious Corps]]  assaulted on 19 February 1945.  For the assault the[[Naval Mobile Construction Battalion 133|133rd CB]] and the 31st CB were [[Temporary duty assignment|attached]] to the 4th and 5th Marine Divisions  as shore party.  The 133rd suffered the most casualties in Seabee History tasked to the 23rd Marines.  Only basic road construction was accomplished during the first days. Work on the first airfield began until D+5<ref name=\"CBHISTORY\"/>\n\n\"Seabees provided critical support at [[Battle of Okinawa|Okinawa]] where the [[XXIV Corps (United States)|24th Army Corps]] and [[III Amphibious Corps|Third Marine Amphibious Corps]] landed off Rhinos and causeways of the 130th CB.  The 58th, 71st, and 145th CBs were all attached the 1st, 2nd and 6th Marine Divisions for the assault.  Numerous CBs followed as the Okinawa task was immense: a road system, numerous air bases, quonset cities, supply and fuel depots, hospital and harbor facilities.  Nearly 55,000 Seabees, in four brigades would do the job.

The vast oceans between the U.S and the enemy on both sides made the [[Military logistics|logistics]] of war a major concern. [[Ben Moreell|Rear Admiral Moreell]] completely understood the issues at hand.  What needed to be done was build staging bases and create a military construction force to do build them to take the war to the enemy.  The concept of Naval Construction Battalions had been slowly developing at [[Naval Facilities Engineering Command]] [[Bureau of Yards and Docks]] (BuDocks) in the 1930s.  The onset of war clarified to Moreell the need to be able to develop advance bases to project American power.  The solution was to tap the United States vast pool of skilled labor. Put it in uniform to build anything, anywhere under any conditions and get the Marine Corps to train them. The first volunteers were skilled recruits at enlistment. To obtain these men, military age limits were modified to take 18\u201350 years old.  It was later found that several past 60 had managed to get in. Men were given advanced rank/pay based upon experience making the Seabees the highest paid group in the U.S. military.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://web.mst.edu/~rogersda/umrcourses/ge342/SeaBees-Revised.pdf |first=J.

For the next year Seabees were picked by the [[Selective Service System]].  Recruits were younger and came with only basic skills.\"<ref name=\"CBHistory\" />  To address this issue the Seabees created training programs in more than 60 skilled trades. They would become renowned for unofficial trades like souvenir making, and the arts of obtaining materials by unofficial and unorthodox means<ref group=note>\"Cumshaw\" ({{cite web|title=Cumshaw definition|work=Merrian Webster|url=https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/cumshaw}}) and \"moonlight procurement\"</ref> The key tools of the Seabees were [[bulldozers]], [[Float (nautical)|float pontoons]], [[Marston Mat]], corregated steel, applied with \"some ingenuity and [[elbow grease]]\"<ref name= \"USNWWII\">{{cite |title=The U.S. Navy in WWII |first= Mark |last=Henry|publisher= Osprey Publishing| series=Elite 80 |year=2002 |page=24}}</ref> Nearly 11,400 officers joined the [[Civil Engineer Corps]] during the war, and 7,960 of them served with CBs.  The Seebees simultaneously constructed on multiple islands, across vast distances in support of American forces. On February 13th, 1945 the Chief of Naval Operations,  Fleet Admiral [[Ernest J. King]], approved the retention of CBs as a permanent part of the Navy.<ref>{{ cite |url=http://seabeemagazine.navylive.dodlive.mil/2018/02/11/This-Week-in-Seabee-History-February-11-February-17/On |date=February 11, 2018 |title=This Date in Seabee History |work=Seabee Online Magazine}}</ref>  Before that happened they would provide the men and skills needed by the top secret [[Chemical Warfare Service]] [[Flame tank|Flame Tank]] Group.\n\n== Pre-war naval construction development ==\nIn the late 1930s the US was not yet actively involved in fighting [[World War II]], but saw the need to prepare for such an eventuality. [[Rear Admiral]] [[Ben Moreell]], CEC, USN, became Chief of the Bureau of Yards and Docks (BUDOCKS) in 1937. Congress therefore authorized the expansion of naval Shore Activities, which included construction in the Caribbean and by 1939 in the Central Pacific. \"Following standard peacetime guidelines the Navy awarded these contracts to civilian constructions firms. These contractors employed native civilian populations as well as U.S citizens and were answerable to naval officers in charge of construction. By 1941 large U.S. naval bases were being built on Guam, Midway, Wake, Pearl Harbor, Iceland, Newfoundland, Bermuda, and Trinidad to name a few.\"<ref name=\"NHHC\">{{cite web|title=Seabee History: Introduction|publisher=Naval History and Heritage Command|date=Feb 17, 2017|url=https://www.history.navy.mil/content/history/nhhc/research/library/online-reading-room/title-list-alphabetically/s/seabee-history0/seabee-history.html}}</ref> International law, dictated civilians not to resist enemy military attacks.

The first three Battalions were formed in the first month. Enlistment was voluntary until December 1942, when the [[Selective Service System]] became responsible for all recruitment.

BuDocks deemed it essential that CBs be commanded by [[Civil Engineer Corps]] (CEC) officers trained in the skills required for the execution of construction projects.<ref name=\"BBWWII\" />  The [[Bureau of Naval Personnel]] strongly objected to this violation of Naval tradition.<ref name=\"BBWWII\" /> Admiral Moreell took the issue directly to the Secretary of the Navy.<ref name=\"BBWWII\" /> On March 19th the Secretary gave the CEC authority to command all officers and enlisted assigned to naval construction units and granted the CEC command status for combat operations.<ref name=\"BBWWII\"/>With CBs authorized and the command question settled,  BuDocks then had to deal with recruitment and training.  Following that was deciding the military organization structure and organizing the logistical support necessary to make everything work. This all happened quickly.  Due to the exigencies of war there was a great deal of \"improvisation\", a quality that became synonymous with Seabees in general.<ref name=CBHISTORY/>\n\n\"At Naval Construction Training Centers (CTC) and Advanced Base Depots (ABD) on both coasts, Seabees learned: trade skills, military discipline, and advanced combat training. Although technically designated \"support\", Seabees frequently found themselves under fire with the Marines.  After completing boot training at [[Camp Allen]] VA. and later [[Camp Peary]] VA, the men were formed into CBs or other smaller CB units. The first four battalions were deployed immediately upon completion of recruit training due to the backlog of construction projects. Battalions that followed were sent to an ABDs at either [[Davisville, Rhode Island]], or [[Port Hueneme, California]] to be staged, outfitted, and trained prior to shipping out.  Basic military training was done by the Navy while the [[United States Marine Corps|Marine Corps]] provided [[United States Marine Corps School of Infantry|advanced military training]] at Camp Peary, Camp Lejeune or Camp Pendelton.  About 175,000 Seabees were staged out of Port Hueneme during the war.  Units that had seen extended service in the Pacific were returned to the [[R&R (military)|R&R]] Center at [[Camp Parks]], Shoemaker, CA.

Each company could do smaller jobs independently as they each had all the basic ratings for doing any job.  Hq. Co. was made up  primarily of fleet yeomen, storekeepers, medical and dental personal, cooks, laundrymen, postal  clerks, gunners-mates [[Master-at-arms (United States Navy)|shore patrol]], chaplain plus Seabee draftsman and surveyors. The standard battalion complement was set at 32 officers and 1,073 enlisted.\n\n\"By 1944 construction projects grew in scope and scale.  Often more than one CB was assigned to a job. To promote efficient administrative control 3-4 battalions would be organized into a regiment, if necessary, two or more regiments were organized into a brigade. An example of this was Okinawa where 55,000 Seabees were organized into regiments and brigades. All were under the Commander, Construction Troops,  Commodore Andrew G. Bisset (CEC).  Additionally, he commanded 45,000 U.S. Army engineers making Okinawa the largest concentration of construction troops ever.\"<ref name=\"CBHistory\" />\n\nThe overall total construction cost of Seabee projects was $11 billion.  At wars end they would number over 258,000. The NCF grew into 12 Naval Construction Brigades of: 54 Naval Construction Regiments, 151 Naval Construction Battalions, 39 Special Construction Battalions, 136 CB Maintaince Units, 118 CB Detachments, and 5 Pontoon Assembly Detachments.{{sfn|Rottman|2008|pages= 31\u201332}} In addition, many Seabees had served outside the NCF in [[Naval Combat Demolition Units]] (NCDU)s, [[Underwater Demolition Teams]](UDT)s, Cubs, Lions Acorns and United States [[Marine Corps]].\n\nWhile the CB itself was versatile it was apparent that some units could be smaller and/or specialized for task specific units.  \"The first departure from the standard CB was the \"Special\" Construction Battalion, or the \"CB Special\". \"Special\" CBs were composed of [[stevedores]] and [[longshoremen]] who were badly needed for the unloading of cargo in combat zones. Many officers for \"Specials\" were recruited from the [[Merchant Marine]] (and commissioned as CEC) while stevedoring companies were the source of many of the enlisted. Soon, the efficiency of cargo handling in combat zones was on a par to that found in the most efficient ports in the U.S.\"<ref name=\"CBHistory\" />  There were five battalions specialized in pontoons, barges, and causeways: 70th, 81st, 111th, 128th, 302nd.{{sfn |last= Rottman| 2002|page=31}  The 134th & 139th CBs were made trucking units due to the transportation and logistic needs on Guam and Okinawa.\n\n\"Several different types of smaller, specialized units were created. Construction Battalion Maintenance Units/CBMUs, a quarter the size of a CB were one. They were Public Works units intended to assume base maintenance of newly constructed bases.  Another unit type was the Construction Battalion Detachment/CBD, of  6 to 600 men. CBDs did everything from running tire-repair shops to operating [[dredges]]. Many were tasked with the handling, launching, assembly, installation of pontoon causeways.  Others were petroleum dets specializing in [[pipeline transport|pipelines]] or [[Oil terminal|petroleum facilities]]).\"<ref name=\"CBHistory\" />\n\nThe \"Seabee\" logo in use today was created by Frank J. Iafrate, a file clerk employed at the [[Camp Endicott]], [[Quonset Point]], [[Rhode Island]]. Iafrate was known for his caricature drawings.  A lieutenant asked Iafrate if he could draw a \"[[Disney]] style\" insignia for the new Naval force. After brainstorming ideas,  the bee became his choice. Bees are the epitome of industry, hard work, and don't trouble others unless bothered first.  He spent three hours on a Sunday afternoon sketching.  He added the sailor's cap along with petty officer rank and the tools of the machinist mate's, carpenter's mate, and gunner's mate.  On each wrist he placed the CEC insignia above the glove. For a border he set the image inside a letter Q for Quonset Point. The next day he gave it to the lieutenant, who showed it to his captain, who sent it off to RADM. Moreell in Washington.  All RADM. Moreell requested was that Iafrate change the border from a Q to a hawser \"rope\" in keeping with Naval tradition for Naval insignia.<ref>{{cite web|url = http://www.nsva.org/Seabee%20Orgin.htm|title = The Origin of the Seabees|accessdate = May 20, 2014|website = NSVA.org|publisher = Navy Seabee Veterans of America, Inc.|url-status = dead|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20131026120526/http://nsva.org/Seabee%20Orgin.htm|archivedate = October 26, 2013}}</ref>\n\n=== The Atlantic theater ===\n[[File:Omaha Mulberry Harbour.jpg|thumb|A [[Mulberry_harbour#Whales|\"Whale\"]] roadway leading to a Spud pier at [[Mulberry harbour|Mulberry]] A off [[Omaha Beach]]]]\n[[File:US Army vehicles rolling off Mulberry A 16 June 1944.jpg|thumb|U.S. Army vehicles transit a floating causeway built by U.S. Navy Seabees off \"Mulberry A\" at Omaha Beach in June 1944]]\n\n\"When the U.S. found itself in a two ocean war, the Panama Canal became a strategic point. The convergence of shipping lanes necessitated forming bases to protect the approaches to the canal.  Agreements around the Caribbean made it possible to secure sites as needed. The [[Lend Lease Agreement]] with [[Great Britain]] also made sites available while existing bases were enlarged. Under the Greenslade Program naval bases in [[Puerto Rico]], [[Cuba]], and the [[Panama Canal]] Zone were all expanded. The construction program undertaken in Puerto Rico was ambitious. [[Naval Station Roosevelt Roads]] was turned into the \"[[Pearl Harbor]] of the Caribbean.  Construction on existing bases was done primarily by civilian contractors until late 1943.  Then CBs took over any unfinished projects. In the Atlantic the bases formed a line from [[Bermuda]] to Brazil. On the Pacific side of the Americas the U.S had bases from the [[Honduras]] to [[Ecuador]]. <ref name=\"NAVBASESoAm\">{{cite book|chapter-url=http://www.ibiblio.org/hyperwar/USN/Building_Bases/bases-18.html|chapter=Chapter XVIII: Bases in South America and the Caribbean Area, Including Bermuda|title={{harvp|Building the Navy's Bases in World War II}}: \u2026 Volume II|via=HyperWar}}</ref>  The 80th(colored) CB upgraded Carlson airfield on [[Trinidad]].

While not in combat zones they were necessary to the overall war effort.\"<ref name=\"NAVBASESoAm\" />\n\n\"[[North Africa]] was the Seabees first combat in the Atlantic.  Landing with the assault in November 1942, Seabees built facilities at [[Oran]], [[Casablanca]], [[Sifi]] and [[Fedala]]. Later they would build a string of staging and training areas along the [[Mediterranean]] including [[NAS Port Lyautey]], [[Morocco]].\"<ref name=CBHISTORY/>\n\n\"Once Tunisia was taken the Seabees began a buildup at [[Bizerte]]. There they prepped steel pontoon boxes for their first use in combat at Sicily. This Seabee \"innovation\" was adapted for amphibious warfare. A pontoon box was standardized in size so multiple pontoons could be quickly assembled like to form causeways, piers, or rhinos.  As such they could be used to meet the exigencies of amphibious warfare. The beaches of [[Sicily]] were considered impossible  for an amphibious landing by both the Allies and Axis.  The Seabees with their pontoons proved that was not true. The Germans were overwhelmed by the men and material that poured ashore over pontoon causeways.<ref name=CBHISTORY/>\n\n\"Seabee causeways were used again at [[Salerno]] and [[Anzio]]. The Germans were prepared causing heavy casualties at both. Seabees moving supplies and ammo across their causeways were amongst them. For many months Seabees remained at Anzio under continuous German fire. When [[Southern Italy]] finally fell the Seabees had one more Mediterranean task in [[Operation Dragoon]] at [[Toulon]].\"<ref name=CBHISTORY/>\n\n\"Seabee operations in the [[North Atlantic]] begun early 1942.  The first projects were in [[Iceland]], [[Newfoundland]], and [[Greenland]] at bases acquired from Great Britain.  These installations provided airfields and ports to protect [[Battle of the Atlantic|Allied convoys]] in the North Atlantic. To complete a defense line across the North Atlantic, Seabees were sent to the UK. [[Port of Londonderry|Londonderry]], [[Northern Ireland]], [[Lough Erne]], [[Loch Ryan]], and [[Rosneath]] in [[Scotland]] were transformed into depots, tank farms, and seaplane bases.  Once completed the Seabees moved to prepare for [[Operation Overlord]]. From [[Milford Haven]] in  [[Wales]] to [[Plymouth]] and over to [[Exeter]], the Seabees built invasion bases and prepared for their most critical and multifaceted role in the Atlantic.\"<ref name=CBHISTORY/>\n\nD-Day Normandy found Seabees amongst the first ashore as [[Naval Combat Demolition Units]] (NCDU) along with the Army's Engineers. Their task was to remove beach obstacles built to impede amphibious landings.<ref name=CBHISTORY/>\n\n\"NCDUs came under very heavy German fire. Ignoring danger NCDUs worked until all their charges were placed and detonated. The result created gaps in the obstacles allowing the landing to progress. Once the invasion fleet arrived off the coast, the 10,000 Seabees of Naval Construction Regiment 25 began placeing their pontoon causeways. It was over these causeways that the invasion force went ashore to reach the gaps.\"<ref name=CBHISTORY/>\n\nAnother Seabee contribution was their Rhinos. [[Rhino ferry|Rhino ferries]] were a motorized or towed variation of the modular pontoon boxes. With them vast amounts of men and material were ferried ashore.  Seabees also assembled the offshore [[piers]], and [[breakwaters] into [[Mulberry A]] for the American sector.  It was to provide a port until French ports were captured and brought back into use. Even after the harbor destroyed by a storm the Seabees continued to landed thousands of tons supplies daily. In the first 28 days they were responsible for thousands of troops getting ashore.<ref name=CBHISTORY/>\n\n\"The [[Battle of Cherbourg|liberation of Cherbourg]] and [[Operation Astonia|Le Havre]] provided CBs major projects. Those harbors were very much needed by the Allies. Foreseeing this the Germans had left them in ruins.  At Cherbourg the first cargo landed within 11 days of the Seabees arrival and within a month the harbor was handling 14 ships at a time. Seabees made the same thing happen at Le Havre and again at [[Brest, France|Brest]], [[Lorient]], and [[St. Nazaire]].\"<ref name=CBHISTORY/>\n\n\"The last Seabee project in Europe was the [[Operation Lumberjack|crossing of the Rhine]].  The U.S. Army called for Seabees to do the job.  The first crossing was at [[Bad Neuenahr]] near [[Remagen]]. More followed quickly  as the Seabees made the task look easy. On 22 March 1945, General [[George S. Patton]], put his armor across at [[Oppenheim]]. Seabees used pontoon ferries to get the job done. In all, they had more than 300 craft shuttling troops and armor across. One crew even ferried Prime Minister [[Winston Churchill]].\"<ref name=CBHISTORY/>\n\n\"The 69th was the only CB to serve in Germany.  They also were the first CB to be deployed by air when they were flown from England to [[Bremen]] in April 1945. The battalion set up camp just outside the city. Their task was to repair damaged buildings and power lines for use by the U.S. occupation force. A detachment was sent to the nearby port of [[Bremerhaven]] make it operational for the Allies.  Another detachment was sent to [[Frankfurt-am-Main]] to refurbish buildings for the Hq of the U.S. Navy in Germany.  By August 1945 the battalion had returned to England ending the Seabees Atlantic story.\"<ref name=CBHISTORY/>\n\n=== The Pacific theater ===\n[[File:B-29s Landing on Tinian 1944.jpg|thumb|B-29s Landing on Tinian 1944]]\n[[File:USMC Photo Nh-97250.jpg|thumb|[[Type A K\u014d-hy\u014dteki-class submarine]] two-man sub salvaged by 6th CB off Tassafaronga Point.]]\n[[File:\"34th CB's trading with natives from Malaita.

Their deeds were unparalleled in history.   With 80 percent of the NCF in the Pacific, they literally built the road to V-J-day with: 111 major airstrips, 441 piers, 2,558 ammunition magazines, 700 square blocks of warehouses, hospitals to for 70,000 patients, fuel tanks for 100 million gallons, and barracks for 1.5 million men. They would serve on over 300 islands.\"<ref name=CBHISTORY/>\n\n\"From the onset, the entire Pacific, including [[Alaska]] and the [[Aleutian Islands Campaign|Aleutians]] were Japanese targets. Japanese operations of 1942, took the islands of Attu and Kiska.  Seabees sent to the [[North Pacific|North]] were there to help forestall what appeared at the time to be a major Japanese offensive.  By late June 1942 they had begun bases on [[Adak Island|Adak]] and [[Amchitka]] in the Aleutians.  They would serve as a deterrent for the remainder of the war.\"<ref name=CBHISTORY/>\n\n\"The first CB projects were on [[Bora Bora]] where the 1st CB Detachment arrived February 1942. The det took the name \"Bobcats\" from the Operation's code name BOBCAT (they had departed the U.S. so quickly that the \"Seabee\" name did not exist). Their task was to construct a fuel depot for ships and planes enroute to Australia. The Bobcats learned of many tropical issues: persistent precipitation, 50 types of [[dysentery]], numerous [[Tropical skin disease|skin diseases]], and the dreaded [[elephantiasis]]. These all combined to make conditions miserable and were harbingers of what was awaiting Seabees else-wheres. From the start their task was difficult, despite this there was satisfaction when the island's tank farms supported [[Task Force 44]] for the [[Battle of the Coral Sea]].\"<ref name=CBHISTORY/>\n\n\"While the Bobcats were in transit to Bora Bora the 2nd and 3rd CB Dets were formed. The 2nd CB Det was sent to [[Tongatapu]] in the [[Tonga Islands]] while the 3rd CB Det went to [[Efate]] in the [[New Hebrides]].  Both islands were also on routes to Australia. . \nBases built on them would support actions in the Coral Sea and the [[Guadalcanal Campaign|Solomon Islands]]. [[Espiritu Santo]] in the [[New Hebrides]] became strategic when the Japanese took [[Guadalcanal]], the southern most point of their expansion.  Destruction of Japanese airfields nearing completion on that island became imperative to stop further expansion.  The 3rd CB Det was rushed from Efate to Espiritu Santo to build a countermanding airfield asap. Within 20 days a 6000ft airstrip had been carved from the jungle.  When Marines made their assault Guadalcanal the 6th CB became the first CB to see combat. Their task was keeping Henderson Field operational.  The Japanese made this a never-ending job. As fast as it was repaired they would bomb it again.  The first Seabee to be decorated received a Silver Star for actions there.\"<ref name=CBHISTORY/>  \"The Marines made simultaneous landings on [[Guadalcanal]] and [[Tulagi Island]] with Seabees tasked to both.

CBs of the 7th Amphibious group built advance bases and depots from Australia and [[New Guinea]] through the [[Philippines]] to Okinawa.  The landing at [[Treasury Island]] became Seabee legend.  An 87th Seabee with a bulldozer took out a machine gun nest for a [[Silver Star]] there.\"<ref name=CBHISTORY/> By V-J Day NCF Seabees would be awarded 5 [[Navy Cross (United States)|Navy Crosses]], 33 Silver Stars, and over 2000 [[Purple Heart]]s.  Many would receive citations and commendations from the Matine Corps.  Seabees serving outside the NCF received numerous awards as well. Those in the UDTs would make Naval/Marine Corps awards History.  Admiral Turner put up over 60 officers for the Silver star and over 300 enlisted for the Bronze star with Vs.\n\n\"By mid-1943 at [[Merauke]], [[New Guinea]] Seabees built an air strip and comm station at [[Port Moresby]].  In December Seabees transferred to the 1st Marine Division landed at [[Battle of Cape Gloucester|Cape Gloucester]]. During the battle, Seabees of the 3rd Battalion [[19th Marines]] bulldozed paths to the Japanese lines so Marine tanks could attack.  They had to be told to hold up because they were so far beyond the lines.  By New Year's, the Marines had taken the enemy airfields on the Cape.\"<ref name=CBHISTORY/>\n\n\"Taking the [[Admiralty Islands|Admiralities]] became key to isolating [[Rabaul]] and the neutralizing of New Britain.  Seizure of [[Manus Island]] and [[Los Negros Island]] cut supplies from all points north and east. By 1944 Seabees had transformed those islands into the largest Lion and Oak in the Southwest Pacific.  It became the main supply and repair depot of the [[Seventh Fleet]]. The [[Landing on Emirau|capture of Emirau]] completed the encirclement of Rabaul.  A strategic two-field Oak, with depots, dry dock, and PT base was constructed there.\"<ref name=CBHISTORY/>\n\n\"[[Island hopping]] with Gen. [[Douglas MacArthur|MacArthur]] CBs reached [[Jayapura|Hollandia]] making it instrumental in the liberation of the Philippines. The 3rd Naval Construction Brigade was with MacArthur for return to [[Battle of Leyte|Leyte]]. Seabee pontoon barges and causeways brought MacArthur's Forces ashore.  Those Seabees were joined by the 2nd and 7th Naval Construction Brigades. This NCF totaled 37,000 and would turn the Philippines into a forward base for the assault on the Japan.  The 7th Fleet Hq was moved to the there with Seabees building everything required: fleet anchorages, sub bases, fleet repair facilities, fuel and supply depots, Pt bases and air stations.<ref name=CBHISTORY/>  At [[Dulag, Leyte]]  Seabee activity finally became a priority to the Japanese .  There the 61st CB had a detachment building a fighter strip come under aerial assault by Japanese [[paratroopers]].  The battle lasted 72 hours with the Japanese losing over 350 men.<ref>Seafoam, 61st CB cruisebook, 14 April, 1945, p. 46</ref> \n\n\"In the Central Pacific CBs we're both directly and indirectly involved in the fighting.  After landing in all the Marine assaults, CBs built the bases from which the U.S. moved relentlessly toward the Japanese homeland.  [[Tarawa Atoll|Tarawa]] in the Gilberts was bad, but in fifteen hours Seabees had the airfield operational.  They turned Majuro Atoll into one of the fleet's Lions and similarly transformed Kwajalein Atoll into a Oak.\"<ref name=CBHISTORY/>\n\n\"Seizure of the Marianas marked the beginning of the end. Their loss cut a Japanese line of defense.  More important, they placed Japan within range of U.S. bombers. During Operation \"Forager,\" Seabees made some of their most significant contributions in the Pacific landing with the Marines at [[ Battle of Kwajalein|Kwanjalein]],[[Battle of Saipan|Saipan]], [[Battle of Guam (1944)|Guam]], and [[Battle of Tinian|Tinian]]. The day the Marines captured [[Saipan International Airport|Aslito]] on Saipan, the Seabees went to work to get it operational in four days. During the battle for Guam,  CB Specials did stevedoring while others were combat engineers for the Marines.  When they were done CBs turned Guam into a Lion HQ for the fleet and an Oak for B-29s. The invasion of Tinian was a showcase of Seabee ingenuity and engineering. The CEC engineered detachable ramps mounted on [[Landing Vehicle Tracked|LVT-2s]] making landings possible where the Japanese thought it was impossible. Before the island was even secure, Seabees were completing an unfinished Japanese airfield.\"<ref name=CBHISTORY/>\n\n\"After the Marianas B-29s were in need of an emergency landing field and a forward base for fighter escorts. The island chosen was [[Iwo Jima]] which [[V Amphibious Corps]]  assaulted on 19 February 1945.  For the assault the[[Naval Mobile Construction Battalion 133|133rd CB]] and the 31st CB were [[Temporary duty assignment|attached]] to the 4th and 5th Marine Divisions  as shore party.  The 133rd suffered the most casualties in Seabee History tasked to the 23rd Marines.  Only basic road construction was accomplished during the first days. Work on the first airfield began until D+5<ref name=\"CBHISTORY\"/>\n\n\"Seabees provided critical support at [[Battle of Okinawa|Okinawa]] where the [[XXIV Corps (United States)|24th Army Corps]] and [[III Amphibious Corps|Third Marine Amphibious Corps]] landed off Rhinos and causeways of the 130th CB.  The 58th, 71st, and 145th CBs were all attached the 1st, 2nd and 6th Marine Divisions for the assault.  Numerous CBs followed as the Okinawa task was immense: a road system, numerous air bases, quonset cities, supply and fuel depots, hospital and harbor facilities.  Nearly 55,000 Seabees, in four brigades would do the job.

It is the second video game in the ''[[Mega Man Zero]]'' subseries of ''[[Mega Man]]'' video games.\n\nThe game is set one year following the events of ''[[Mega Man Zero (video game)|Mega Man Zero]]'', and follows the same basic format as its predecessor, being a side-scrolling, platform action game. Once again, players take control of the Reploid known as Zero, and lead him through various levels in the battle against the forces of Neo Arcadia.\n\nThe European version also released the same day as the North American ''[[Mega Man X7]]'' was. It was released in Japan on the [[Wii U]]'s Virtual Console on January 7, 2015.<ref>{{cite web|title=Virtual Console update: GBA titles, Breath of Fire and more|url=http://www.capcom-unity.com/brelston/blog/2014/06/09/virtual-console-update-gba-titles-breath-of-fire-and-more|date=June 9, 2014}}</ref> In February 2020, the game was released on [[PlayStation 4]], [[Xbox One]], [[Nintendo Switch]], and PC via [[Steam]] as part of the ''Mega Man Zero/ZX Legacy Collection''.\n\n==Plot==\nOne year has passed since [[Zero (Mega Man)|Zero]] defeated Copy X. He has since separated from Ciel and the Resistance, now wandering the desert and defeating countless Pantheons. The three surviving members of the Four Guardians have assumed command of Neo Arcadia, with Harpuia as the leader. Copy X's death was covered up, as the humans revered him as their savior. The Resistance is now being led by a Reploid named Elpizo, while Ciel continues her work on a new form of energy that will hopefully eliminate the need for war.\n\nZero wearily makes his way through a sandstorm wrapped in a tattered cloak. As the sands die down he is once more being chased by enemies. Despite being in disrepair, with cracked armor and broken weapons, he charges into the fray. After the battle, Zero collapses from exhaustion and is found by Harpuia. Wishing to see Zero die in battle rather than perish from exhaustion, Harpuia rescues Zero and covertly delivers him to a location near the Resistance base, where he is found and repaired. He learns that Elpizo is planning a frontal assault on Neo Arcadia, as he doesn't believe in Ciel's plan of creating energy as means to resolve the war. Unable to convince him to call it off, Zero is left to do busy-work in the meantime.\n\nElpizo's assault fails miserably, himself being the only survivor. Driven mad, he declares his desire to harness the power of the legendary Dark Elf to destroy Neo Arcadia (and wipe out the humans), which had brought about the Elf Wars a century ago that left the Earth in a disastrous state. Using the powers granted by partially unsealing the Dark Elf, he invades Neo Arcadia and breaks into the temple where the body of the real X is kept. It is revealed that X ended the Elf Wars by sealing the Dark Elf away with his body, thus leading to his disappearance. Despite the Guardians' and Zero's best efforts, Elpizo  destroys X's body, which unseals the Dark Elf, and Elpizo absorbs its powers.\n\nAfter a fierce battle, Zero puts an end to Elpizo's plans, who reverts to his normal self and apologizes as he dies. Surprisingly, the Dark Elf turns him into a Cyber-elf, convincing Elpizo that she is not truly evil. As the Dark Elf departs, X appears and tells Zero about the Dark Elf: she was originally known as the Mother Elf and was the savior who ended the Maverick Wars, but was later cursed by a man named [[Doctor Weil (Mega Man Zero)|Dr. Weil]]. Zero admits to feeling like he knows her.\n\nIn a post credits scene, an unknown man notes the Dark Elf has been released, and tells an entity known as \"Omega\" that it is time to take action.\n\n==Gameplay==\nThe controls are identical to that in the previous game, with players given the option to assign functions to the buttons they are most comfortable using. The weapons are also identical, with the exception of the Triple Rod, which has been replaced by the similar but somewhat more complex Chain Rod.\n\n[[Cyber Elf|Cyber Elves]] are present in the game, and function in the same manner as they did in the previous game. However, unlike the first game, in which four specific Cyber Elves could be transformed into health-storing Sub-Tanks, two of the four Sub-Tanks are now hidden in various stages as collectible items, as they were in the previous series, while the remaining two must be unlocked using Cyber Elves.\n\nWhile the first game in the series had the player select missions from a list, ''Mega Man Zero 2'' returns to the traditional Stage Select option found in the ''[[Mega Man]]'' and ''[[Mega Man X]]'' games, although the player can only select from four at a time. In addition, whereas ''Mega Man Zero'' had a large, interconnected world, none of the stages in this game are linked.\n\nNew features added to the game are Forms and EX Skills. Forms are unlocked by completing various tasks during a mission, such as destroying a set number of enemies with the Buster Shot. Forms alter Zero's abilities in various ways, such as increasing the power of certain weapons or making him more resilient. However, they also tend to decrease performance in other areas, such as lowering attack power for increased defense or removing special attacks of the Z-Saber to enhance the Buster Shot. EX Skills are unlocked if a player completes a mission with an A or S rank, allowing the player to give Zero's weapons the properties of the bosses he's defeated.\n\nPlayers begin the game with the Buster Shot and the Z-Saber. After the introductory mission, Zero is granted the Shield Boomerang and the Chain Rod, which replaces the Triple Rod in the previous game. As with the previous game, the player can unlock new attacks and abilities for the weapons through repeated use. There are fewer upgrades in this game; the Z-Saber has a total of four upgrades, while the rest only have two.\n\nCyber Elves function in the same manner as the previous game, being single-use aids with either temporary or permanent effects on Zero or the game's levels. They are hidden throughout the game as well as dropped by enemies. The use of Cyber Elves penalizes the mission score. There are three types of Cyber Elves, \"Nurse\", \"Animal and Hacker. While certain Elves can be used immediately, the larger Elves need to be fed crystals in order to be used. The cost for doing so is significantly less than it was in the previous game.\n\nThis game introduces the concept of Forms, which can be earned by meeting certain criteria throughout the game, ranging from killing twenty enemies in a stage with a dashing slash technique to getting twenty-five energy capsules in one stage.\n\nAnother new addition to the series is EX Skills, which are similar to Mega Man's ability to copy powers from the bosses in previous series. Unlike the previous series, however, Zero has to have an A or S rank going into the stage to unlock the bosses EX Skill. Unlike Mega Man's copy ability, which required weapon energy to feed the attacks, EX Skills modify Zero's weapons, adding new abilities or replacing their normal abilities with an ability similar to the defeated boss. For example, the Buster Shot can be modified to fire a long-piercing beam instead of its normal charged blast, while the Z-Saber gains additional moves such as a powerful rising slash.\n\nAs with the first game, a \"[[New Game Plus]]\" can be played by beating the game and loading the completed save file. In the new game, Zero will start with all activated Cyber Elves used from the previous game still in effect (the penalties, however, will still remain). Zero will also get to keep any EX Skills and alternate forms that he earned in the previous game. Additional modes can also be unlocked under proper conditions.\n\nHard Mode is unlocked by beating the game once. To play, hold L when selecting to start a New Game. In Hard Mode, Zero starts with the \"Proto Form\", which doubles his attack strength but halves his defense and locks his weapons at their basic level. Zero also cannot earn any EX skills or alternate forms. Beating Hard Mode will unlock a special \"Image Gallery\" option. Hold L and Select when selecting New Game to enter it.\n\nUnlike the other games in the series, there is no Ultimate Mode to be unlocked. However, an \"Ultimate Form\" can be unlocked by leveling up and using every Cyber Elf in the game.

[[handheld game console]]. It is the second video game in the ''[[Mega Man Zero]]'' subseries of ''[[Mega Man]]'' video games.\n\nThe game is set one year following the events of ''[[Mega Man Zero (video game)|Mega Man Zero]]'', and follows the same basic format as its predecessor, being a side-scrolling, platform action game. Once again, players take control of the Reploid known as Zero, and lead him through various levels in the battle against the forces of Neo Arcadia.\n\nThe European version also released the same day as the North American ''[[Mega Man X7]]'' was. It was released in Japan on the [[Wii U]]'s Virtual Console on January 7, 2015.<ref>{{cite web|title=Virtual Console update: GBA titles, Breath of Fire and more|url=http://www.capcom-unity.com/brelston/blog/2014/06/09/virtual-console-update-gba-titles-breath-of-fire-and-more|date=June 9, 2014}}</ref> In February 2020, the game was released on PlayStation 4, X-Box One, Nintendo Switch, and PC via Steam as part of the ''Mega Man Zero/ZX Legacy Collection''.\n\n==Plot==\nOne year has passed since [[Zero (Mega Man)|Zero]] defeated Copy X. He has since separated from Ciel and the Resistance, now wandering the desert and defeating countless Pantheons. The three surviving members of the Four Guardians have assumed command of Neo Arcadia, with Harpuia as the leader. Copy X's death was covered up, as the humans revered him as their savior. The Resistance is now being led by a Reploid named Elpizo, while Ciel continues her work on a new form of energy that will hopefully eliminate the need for war.\n\nZero wearily makes his way through a sandstorm wrapped in a tattered cloak. As the sands die down he is once more being chased by enemies. Despite being in disrepair, with cracked armor and broken weapons, he charges into the fray. After the battle, Zero collapses from exhaustion and is found by Harpuia. Wishing to see Zero die in battle rather than perish from exhaustion, Harpuia rescues Zero and covertly delivers him to a location near the Resistance base, where he is found and repaired. He learns that Elpizo is planning a frontal assault on Neo Arcadia, as he doesn't believe in Ciel's plan of creating energy as means to resolve the war. Unable to convince him to call it off, Zero is left to do busy-work in the meantime.\n\nElpizo's assault fails miserably, himself being the only survivor. Driven mad, he declares his desire to harness the power of the legendary Dark Elf to destroy Neo Arcadia (and wipe out the humans), which had brought about the Elf Wars a century ago that left the Earth in a disastrous state. Using the powers granted by partially unsealing the Dark Elf, he invades Neo Arcadia and breaks into the temple where the body of the real X is kept. It is revealed that X ended the Elf Wars by sealing the Dark Elf away with his body, thus leading to his disappearance. Despite the Guardians' and Zero's best efforts, Elpizo  destroys X's body, which unseals the Dark Elf, and Elpizo absorbs its powers.\n\nAfter a fierce battle, Zero puts an end to Elpizo's plans, who reverts to his normal self and apologizes as he dies. Surprisingly, the Dark Elf turns him into a Cyber-elf, convincing Elpizo that she is not truly evil. As the Dark Elf departs, X appears and tells Zero about the Dark Elf: she was originally known as the Mother Elf and was the savior who ended the Maverick Wars, but was later cursed by a man named [[Doctor Weil (Mega Man Zero)|Dr. Weil]]. Zero admits to feeling like he knows her.\n\nIn a post credits scene, an unknown man notes the Dark Elf has been released, and tells an entity known as \"Omega\" that it is time to take action.\n\n==Gameplay==\nThe controls are identical to that in the previous game, with players given the option to assign functions to the buttons they are most comfortable using. The weapons are also identical, with the exception of the Triple Rod, which has been replaced by the similar but somewhat more complex Chain Rod.\n\n[[Cyber Elf|Cyber Elves]] are present in the game, and function in the same manner as they did in the previous game. However, unlike the first game, in which four specific Cyber Elves could be transformed into health-storing Sub-Tanks, two of the four Sub-Tanks are now hidden in various stages as collectible items, as they were in the previous series, while the remaining two must be unlocked using Cyber Elves.\n\nWhile the first game in the series had the player select missions from a list, ''Mega Man Zero 2'' returns to the traditional Stage Select option found in the ''[[Mega Man]]'' and ''[[Mega Man X]]'' games, although the player can only select from four at a time. In addition, whereas ''Mega Man Zero'' had a large, interconnected world, none of the stages in this game are linked.\n\nNew features added to the game are Forms and EX Skills. Forms are unlocked by completing various tasks during a mission, such as destroying a set number of enemies with the Buster Shot. Forms alter Zero's abilities in various ways, such as increasing the power of certain weapons or making him more resilient. However, they also tend to decrease performance in other areas, such as lowering attack power for increased defense or removing special attacks of the Z-Saber to enhance the Buster Shot. EX Skills are unlocked if a player completes a mission with an A or S rank, allowing the player to give Zero's weapons the properties of the bosses he's defeated.\n\nPlayers begin the game with the Buster Shot and the Z-Saber. After the introductory mission, Zero is granted the Shield Boomerang and the Chain Rod, which replaces the Triple Rod in the previous game. As with the previous game, the player can unlock new attacks and abilities for the weapons through repeated use. There are fewer upgrades in this game; the Z-Saber has a total of four upgrades, while the rest only have two.\n\nCyber Elves function in the same manner as the previous game, being single-use aids with either temporary or permanent effects on Zero or the game's levels. They are hidden throughout the game as well as dropped by enemies. The use of Cyber Elves penalizes the mission score. There are three types of Cyber Elves, \"Nurse\", \"Animal and Hacker. While certain Elves can be used immediately, the larger Elves need to be fed crystals in order to be used. The cost for doing so is significantly less than it was in the previous game.\n\nThis game introduces the concept of Forms, which can be earned by meeting certain criteria throughout the game, ranging from killing twenty enemies in a stage with a dashing slash technique to getting twenty-five energy capsules in one stage.\n\nAnother new addition to the series is EX Skills, which are similar to Mega Man's ability to copy powers from the bosses in previous series. Unlike the previous series, however, Zero has to have an A or S rank going into the stage to unlock the bosses EX Skill. Unlike Mega Man's copy ability, which required weapon energy to feed the attacks, EX Skills modify Zero's weapons, adding new abilities or replacing their normal abilities with an ability similar to the defeated boss. For example, the Buster Shot can be modified to fire a long-piercing beam instead of its normal charged blast, while the Z-Saber gains additional moves such as a powerful rising slash.\n\nAs with the first game, a \"[[New Game Plus]]\" can be played by beating the game and loading the completed save file. In the new game, Zero will start with all activated Cyber Elves used from the previous game still in effect (the penalties, however, will still remain). Zero will also get to keep any EX Skills and alternate forms that he earned in the previous game. Additional modes can also be unlocked under proper conditions.\n\nHard Mode is unlocked by beating the game once. To play, hold L when selecting to start a New Game. In Hard Mode, Zero starts with the \"Proto Form\", which doubles his attack strength but halves his defense and locks his weapons at their basic level. Zero also cannot earn any EX skills or alternate forms. Beating Hard Mode will unlock a special \"Image Gallery\" option. Hold L and Select when selecting New Game to enter it.\n\nUnlike the other games in the series, there is no Ultimate Mode to be unlocked. However, an \"Ultimate Form\" can be unlocked by leveling up and using every Cyber Elf in the game. It increases all of Zero's stats and also allows him to use full-charge attacks instantly by means of simplistic button combos.\n\n===Multiplayer===\nIf you have two cartridges and a link cable, the players can link two GBAs and take part in a two-player game. There are three modes available to take part in:<ref>Mega Man Zero 2 Instruction Manual</ref>\n\n*Time Attack - Set a goal somewhere in the stage.

The institute consists of three service divisions: the academic division - consisting of the colleges and a senior high school (all of which are only medicine and allied health-related courses), its [[Teaching hospital|teaching hospital]] - De La Salle University Medical Center, and a [[Research institute|research facility]] - Angelo King Medical Research Center. Located in [[Dasmari\u00f1as|Dasmari\u00f1as City]], [[Cavite]], it sits only 3 kilometers from [[De La Salle University-Dasmari\u00f1as]] where it is often mistaken as part of due to its proximity but is actually a separate De La Salle campus.\n\n==History==\n\nThe De La Salle Medical and Health Sciences Institute was started by a group of doctors from the College of Medicine of the [[University of the Philippines]] and the [[Philippine General Hospital]] who, in 1976, decided to establish a [[medical school]] to support the need for a well-trained staff for the newly inaugurated Medical Center Manila. Following the national government's policy of dispersing educational facilities outside the [[capital city]] and encouraging the establishment of medical schools in various regions of the country, they decided to establish a medical school in Dasmari\u00f1as City, Cavite. Originally named Emilio Aguinaldo College of Medicine, the school opened in 1979 under the management of the University Physician\u2019s Foundation, Inc. with the Jose P. Rizal National Medical Research Center as its initial [[teaching hospital]]. Then on July 31, 1982, the Foundation inaugurated a 4-storey 180-bed teaching hospital, the University Medical Center.\n\nIn June 1987, ownership and management were acquired by the De La Salle University Inc. In 1992, the college was renamed the De La Salle University College of Medicine and the hospital, the De La Salle University Medical Center. In June 1994, the management of the College of [[Physical Therapy]] which was then part of DLSU-Aguinaldo (now [[De La Salle University - Dasmari\u00f1as|DLSU-D]]) was turned over to the De La Salle University College of Medicine. By June 1995, the complex consisting of the College of Medicine, University Medical Center, College of Physical Therapy, and Research Services was named De La Salle University \u2013 Health Sciences Campus or DLSU-HSC under the ownership and administration of the St. Bro. Miguel Febres Cordero Medical Education Foundation.\n\nIn May 2000, the colleges under the administration of the DLSU-Health Sciences Campus increased with the transfer of the Colleges of [[Radiographer|Medical Radiation Technology]] and [[Nursing]] & [[Midwifery]] (formerly under DLSU-D). Eventually, the institution\u2019s name became De La Salle Health Sciences Institute upon approval of the Board of Trustees in September 2007.\n\nIn January 2018, the term \u201cMedical\u201d was included in the institution's name as granted by the [[Securities and Exchange Commission (Philippines)|Securities and Exchange Commission]].<ref>{{cite web |title=History |url=http://www.dlshsi.edu.ph/de-la-salle-medical-health-sciences-institute/history |accessdate=30 March 2019}}</ref>\n\nIn October 2019, DLSMHSI became an official member of the [[ASEAN University Network]]-Quality Assurance (AUN-QA) as confirmed by Banjong Ujjin, the Senior Programme Officer of the AUN Secretariat Team.<ref>{{cite web |title=AUN-QA ASSOCIATE MEMBERS |url=http://aun-qa.org/associate/current#4 |website=ASEAN University Network-Quality Assurance (AUN-QA) |accessdate=12 October 2019}}</ref>\n\nOn October 25, 2019, the [[Commission on Higher Education (Philippines)|Commission on Higher Education]] (CHED), granted autonomous status to DLSMHSI through the CHED Memorandum Order No. 12, series of 2019. This means that the institution can enjoy a lot of benefits including being allowed to launch new courses/programs in the undergraduate and/or graduate levels including doctoral programs in areas of expertise without securing a permit/authority from CHED; only informing them of the programs to be offered.<ref>{{cite web |title=CMO No. 12, Series of 2019 \u2013 Grant of Autonomous and Deregulated Status to Private HEIs |url=https://ched.gov.ph/wp-content/uploads/CMO-No-12-s-2019-Grant-of-Autonomous-and-Deregulated-Status-to-Private-HEIs.pdf |website=Commission on Higher Education |accessdate=26 October 2019}}</ref>\n\n==Academics==\n===Programs and Accreditations===\nDLSMHSI offers academic programs through its seven colleges and a special health sciences senior high school.

The institute consists of three service divisions: the academic division - consisting of the colleges and a senior high school (all of which are only medicine and allied health-related courses), its [[Teaching hospital|teaching hospital]] - De La Salle University Medical Center, and a [[Research institute|research facility]] - Angelo King Medical Research Center. Located in [[Dasmari\u00f1as|Dasmari\u00f1as City]], [[Cavite]], it sits only 3 kilometers from [[De La Salle University-Dasmari\u00f1as]] where it is often mistaken as part of but is actually a separate De La Salle campus.\n\n==History==\n\nThe De La Salle Medical and Health Sciences Institute was started by a group of doctors from the College of Medicine of the [[University of the Philippines]] and the [[Philippine General Hospital]] who, in 1976, decided to establish a [[medical school]] to support the need for a well-trained staff for the newly inaugurated Medical Center Manila. Following the national government's policy of dispersing educational facilities outside the [[capital city]] and encouraging the establishment of medical schools in various regions of the country, they decided to establish a medical school in Dasmari\u00f1as City, Cavite. Originally named Emilio Aguinaldo College of Medicine, the school opened in 1979 under the management of the University Physician\u2019s Foundation, Inc. with the Jose P. Rizal National Medical Research Center as its initial [[teaching hospital]]. Then on July 31, 1982, the Foundation inaugurated a 4-storey 180-bed teaching hospital, the University Medical Center.\n\nIn June 1987, ownership and management were acquired by the De La Salle University Inc. In 1992, the college was renamed the De La Salle University College of Medicine and the hospital, the De La Salle University Medical Center. In June 1994, the management of the College of [[Physical Therapy]] which was then part of DLSU-Aguinaldo (now [[De La Salle University - Dasmari\u00f1as|DLSU-D]]) was turned over to the De La Salle University College of Medicine. By June 1995, the complex consisting of the College of Medicine, University Medical Center, College of Physical Therapy, and Research Services was named De La Salle University \u2013 Health Sciences Campus or DLSU-HSC under the ownership and administration of the St. Bro. Miguel Febres Cordero Medical Education Foundation.\n\nIn May 2000, the colleges under the administration of the DLSU-Health Sciences Campus increased with the transfer of the Colleges of [[Radiographer|Medical Radiation Technology]] and [[Nursing]] & [[Midwifery]] (formerly under DLSU-D). Eventually, the institution\u2019s name became De La Salle Health Sciences Institute upon approval of the Board of Trustees in September 2007.\n\nIn January 2018, the term \u201cMedical\u201d was included in the institution's name as granted by the [[Securities and Exchange Commission (Philippines)|Securities and Exchange Commission]].<ref>{{cite web |title=History |url=http://www.dlshsi.edu.ph/de-la-salle-medical-health-sciences-institute/history |accessdate=30 March 2019}}</ref>\n\nIn October 2019, DLSMHSI became an official member of the [[ASEAN University Network]]-Quality Assurance (AUN-QA) as confirmed by Banjong Ujjin, the Senior Programme Officer of the AUN Secretariat Team.<ref>{{cite web |title=AUN-QA ASSOCIATE MEMBERS |url=http://aun-qa.org/associate/current#4 |website=ASEAN University Network-Quality Assurance (AUN-QA) |accessdate=12 October 2019}}</ref>\n\nOn October 25, 2019, the [[Commission on Higher Education (Philippines)|Commission on Higher Education]] (CHED), granted autonomous status to DLSMHSI through the CHED Memorandum Order No. 12, series of 2019. This means that the institution can enjoy a lot of benefits including being allowed to launch new courses/programs in the undergraduate and/or graduate levels including doctoral programs in areas of expertise without securing a permit/authority from CHED; only informing them of the programs to be offered.<ref>{{cite web |title=CMO No. 12, Series of 2019 \u2013 Grant of Autonomous and Deregulated Status to Private HEIs |url=https://ched.gov.ph/wp-content/uploads/CMO-No-12-s-2019-Grant-of-Autonomous-and-Deregulated-Status-to-Private-HEIs.pdf |website=Commission on Higher Education |accessdate=26 October 2019}}</ref>\n\n==Academics==\n===Programs and Accreditations===\nDLSMHSI offers academic programs through its seven colleges and a special health sciences senior high school.
