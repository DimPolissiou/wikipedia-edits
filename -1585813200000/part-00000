Traditionally, the term brick referred to a unit composed of [[clay]], but it is now used to denote rectangular units made of clay-bearing soil, sand, and [[Lime (material)|lime]], or [[concrete]] materials. Bricks can be joined together using [[Mortar (masonry)|mortar]], adhesives or by interlocking them.<ref>[https://www.buildupnepal.com/interlocking-bricks/ Interlocking bricks used in Nepal]</ref><ref>[https://vlaanderen-circulair.be/en/cases-in-flanders/detail/facadeclick Bricks that interlock]</ref> Bricks are produced in numerous classes, types, materials, and sizes which vary with region and time period, and are produced in bulk quantities. Two basic categories of bricks are ''fired'' and ''non-fired'' bricks.\n\n[[Concrete masonry unit|''Block'']] is a similar term referring to a rectangular building unit composed of similar materials, but is usually larger than a brick. Lightweight bricks (also called lightweight blocks) are made from [[expanded clay aggregate]].\n\nFired bricks are one of the longest-lasting and strongest [[building material]]s, sometimes referred to as artificial stone, and have been used since circa 4000 BC. Air-dried bricks, also known as [[mudbrick]]s, have a history older than fired bricks, and have an additional ingredient of a mechanical binder such as straw.\n\nBricks are laid in ''courses'' and numerous patterns known as ''bonds'', collectively known as [[brickwork]], and may be laid in various kinds of [[mortar (masonry)|mortar]] to hold the bricks together to make a durable structure.\n\n== History ==\n[[File:Historic brick street in Natchitoches, LA IMG 1943.JPG|thumb|left|Bricked Front Street along the [[Cane River]] in historic [[Natchitoches, Louisiana|Natchitoches]], [[Louisiana]]]]\n\n=== Middle East and South Asia ===\n[[File:Subrahmanya Temple, Saluvanakuppam front view.jpg|thumb|left|Remains of 3rd century BC [[Murugan Temple, Saluvankuppam|Hindu brick temple]], Tamil Nadu, India]]\n[[File:Shebli2.jpg|thumb|upright|The brickwork of [[Shebeli Tower]] in [[Iran]] displays 12th-century craftsmanship]]\n[[File:JetawanaStupa1.JPG|thumb|upright|left|The ancient [[Jetavanaramaya]] [[stupa]] in [[Anuradhapura]], [[Sri Lanka]] is one of the largest brick structures in the world.]]\nThe earliest bricks were ''dried brick'', meaning that they were formed from clay-bearing earth or mud and dried (usually in the sun) until they were strong enough for use.

An independent style of brick architecture, known as [[brick Gothic]] (similar to [[Gothic architecture]]) flourished in places that lacked indigenous sources of rocks. Examples of this architectural style can be found in modern-day [[Denmark]], [[Germany]], [[Poland]], and [[Russia]].\n\nThis style evolved into [[List of Brick Renaissance buildings|Brick Renaissance]] as the stylistic changes associated with the [[Italian Renaissance]] spread to northern Europe, leading to the adoption of [[Renaissance architecture|Renaissance]] elements into brick building. A clear distinction between the two styles only developed at the transition to [[Baroque architecture]]. In [[L\u00fcbeck]], for example, Brick Renaissance is clearly recognisable in buildings equipped with terracotta reliefs by the artist Statius von D\u00fcren, who was also active at [[Schwerin]] ([[Schwerin Castle]]) and [[Wismar]] (F\u00fcrstenhof).\n\nLong-distance [[bulk transport]] of bricks and other construction equipment remained prohibitively expensive until the development of modern transportation infrastructure, with the construction of [[canal]], [[road]]s, and [[railway]]s.\n\n=== Industrial era ===\nProduction of bricks increased massively with the onset of the [[Industrial Revolution]] and the rise in factory building in England. For reasons of speed and economy, bricks were increasingly preferred as building material to stone, even in areas where the stone was readily available. It was at this time in [[London]] that bright red brick was chosen for construction to make the buildings more visible in the heavy fog and to help prevent traffic accidents.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=3ZQl3C5BAHsC|title=London the Biography|author=Peter Ackroyd|page=435|publisher=Random House|year=2001|isbn=978-0-09-942258-7}}</ref>\n\nThe transition from the traditional method of production known as hand-moulding to a mechanised form of mass-production slowly took place during the first half of the nineteenth century. Possibly the first successful brick-making machine was [[patent]]ed by Henry Clayton, employed at the Atlas Works in [[Middlesex]], England, in 1855, and was capable of producing up to 25,000 bricks daily with minimal supervision.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.google.com/patents/US13123|title=Henry Clayton|accessdate=17 December 2012}}</ref> His mechanical apparatus soon achieved widespread attention after it was adopted for use by the [[South Eastern Railway, UK|South Eastern Railway Company]] for brick-making at their factory near [[Folkestone]].<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=S54AAAAAMAAJ&printsec=frontcover&pg=GBS.PA361|title=The Mechanics Magazine and Journal of Engineering, Agricultural Machinery, Manufactures and Shipbuilding|year=1859|page=361}}</ref> The [[Bradley & Craven Ltd]] 'Stiff-Plastic Brickmaking Machine' was patented in 1853, apparently predating Clayton.

The use of brick for [[skyscraper]] construction severely limited the size of the building \u2013 the [[Monadnock Building]], built in 1896 in Chicago, required exceptionally thick walls to maintain the structural integrity of its 17 storeys.\n\nFollowing pioneering work in the 1950s at the [[ETH Zurich|Swiss Federal Institute of Technology]] and the [[Building Research Establishment]] in [[Watford]], UK, the use of improved masonry for the construction of tall structures up to 18 storeys high was made viable. However, the use of brick has largely remained restricted to small to medium-sized buildings, as steel and concrete remain superior materials for high-rise construction.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dehoopsteenwerwe.co.za/information03.html|title=The History of Bricks|publisher=De Hoop:Steenwerve Brickfields}}</ref>\n\n== Types ==\n[[File:2008 BeaconHill Boston 2302897829.jpg|thumb|This wall in [[Beacon Hill, Boston]] shows different types of brickwork and stone foundations]]\nThere are thousands of types of bricks that are named for their use, size, forming method, origin, quality, texture, and/or materials.\n\nCategorized by manufacture method:\n* Extruded \u2013 made by being forced through an opening in a steel die, with a very consistent size and shape.\n** Wire-cut \u2013 cut to size after extrusion with a tensioned wire which may leave drag marks\n* Moulded \u2013 shaped in moulds rather than being extruded\n** Machine-moulded \u2013 clay is forced into moulds using pressure\n** Handmade \u2013 clay is forced into moulds by a person\n* Dry-pressed \u2013 similar to soft mud method, but starts with a much thicker clay mix and is compressed with great force.\n\nCategorized by use:\n* Common or building \u2013 A brick not intended to be visible, used for internal structure\n* Face \u2013 A brick used on exterior surfaces to present a clean appearance\n* Hollow \u2013 not solid, the holes are less than 25% of the brick volume\n** Perforated \u2013 holes greater than 25% of the brick volume\n* Keyed \u2013 indentations in at least one face and end to be used with rendering and plastering\n* Paving \u2013 brick intended to be in ground contact as a walkway or roadway\n* Thin \u2013 brick with normal height and length but thin width to be used as a veneer\n\nSpecialized use bricks:\n* Chemically resistant \u2013 bricks made with resistance to chemicals\n** [[Acid brick]] \u2013 acid resistant bricks\n* [[Engineering brick|Engineering]] \u2013 a type of hard, dense, brick used where strength, low water porosity or acid (flue gas) resistance are needed.

Each type is manufactured differently.\n\n=== Mudbrick ===\n{{Main|Mudbrick}}\nUnfired bricks, also known as [[mudbrick]]s, are made from a wet, clay-containing soil mixed with straw or similar binders. They are air-dried until ready for use.\n\n=== Fired brick ===\n[[File:Brick making in Java.jpg|thumb|upright|Raw bricks sun-drying before being fired|alt=]]\nFired bricks are burned in a kiln which makes them durable. Modern, fired, clay bricks are formed in one of three processes \u2013 soft mud, dry press, or extruded. Depending on the country, either the extruded or soft mud method is the most common, since they are the most economical.\n\nNormally, bricks contain the following ingredients:<ref name=\"punmia\">{{Citation|author1=Punmia, B.C. |author2=Jain, Ashok Kumar |title=Basic Civil Engineering |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=sWZxu_muxyIC&pg=PA33 |year= 2003  |isbn=978-81-7008-403-7 |page=33}}</ref>\n\n# Silica (sand) \u2013 50% to 60% by weight\n# Alumina (clay) \u2013 20% to 30% by weight\n# Lime \u2013 2 to 5% by weight\n# Iron oxide \u2013 \u2264 7% by weight\n# Magnesia \u2013 less than 1% by weight\n\n====Shaping methods====\nThree main methods are used for shaping the raw materials into bricks to be fired:\n\n* Molded bricks \u2013 These bricks start with raw clay, preferably in a mix with 25\u201330% sand to reduce shrinkage. The clay is first ground and mixed with water to the desired consistency. The clay is then pressed into steel moulds with a [[Hydraulics|hydraulic]] press. The shaped clay is then fired (\"burned\") at 900\u20131000&nbsp;\u00b0C to achieve strength.\n* Dry-pressed bricks \u2013 The dry-press method is similar to the soft-mud moulded method, but starts with a much thicker clay mix, so it forms more accurate, sharper-edged bricks. The greater force in pressing and the longer burn make this method more expensive.\n* Extruded bricks \u2013 For extruded bricks the clay is mixed with 10\u201315% [[water]] (stiff extrusion) or 20\u201325% water (soft extrusion) in a [[pugmill]]. This mixture is forced through a [[Die (manufacturing)|die]] to create a long cable of material of the desired width and depth. This mass is then cut into bricks of the desired length by a wall of wires. Most structural bricks are made by this method as it produces hard, dense bricks, and suitable dies can produce perforations as well. The introduction of such holes reduces the volume of clay needed, and hence the cost. Hollow bricks are lighter and easier to handle, and have different thermal properties from solid bricks. The cut bricks are hardened by drying for 20 to 40 hours at 50 to 150&nbsp;\u00b0C before being fired. The heat for drying is often waste heat from the kiln.\n\n==== Kilns ====\n[[File:Raw Indian brick.jpg|thumb|Raw (green) Indian brick]]\n[[File:Xhosa brickmaker at kiln near Ngcobo.jpg|thumb|left|[[Xhosa people|Xhosa]] brickmaker at kiln near [[Ngcobo]] in 2007]]\n[[File:A brickmaker - Tashrih al-aqvam (1825), f.253v - BL Add. 27255.jpg|thumb|A brickmaker in India \u2013 ''Tashrih al-aqvam'' (1825)]]\nIn many modern [[brickworks]], bricks are usually fired in a continuously fired tunnel kiln, in which the bricks are fired as they move slowly through the kiln on [[conveyors]], rails, or kiln cars, which achieves a more consistent brick product. The bricks often have [[Lime (material)|lime]], ash, and organic matter added, which accelerates the burning process.\n\nThe other major kiln type is the Bull's Trench Kiln (BTK), based on a design developed by British engineer W. Bull in the late 19th century.\n\nAn oval or circular trench is dug, 6\u20139 metres wide, 2-2.5 metres deep, and 100\u2013150 metres in circumference. A tall exhaust chimney is constructed in the centre. Half or more of the trench is filled with \"green\" (unfired) bricks which are stacked in an open lattice pattern to allow airflow. The lattice is capped with a roofing layer of finished brick.\n\nIn operation, new green bricks, along with roofing bricks, are stacked at one end of the brick pile. Historically, a stack of unfired bricks covered for protection from the weather was called a \"hack\".<ref>Connolly, Andrew. ''Life in the Victorian Brickyards of Flintshire and Denbigshire'', p34. 2003, Gwasg Carreg Gwalch.</ref> Cooled finished bricks are removed from the other end for transport to their destinations. In the middle, the brick workers create a firing zone by dropping fuel (coal, wood, oil, debris, and so on) through access holes in the roof above the trench.\n\nThe advantage of the BTK design is a much greater energy efficiency compared with [[clamp kiln|clamp]] or [[scove kiln]]s. Sheet metal or boards are used to route the airflow through the brick lattice so that fresh air flows first through the recently burned bricks, heating the air, then through the active burning zone. The air continues through the green brick zone (pre-heating and drying the bricks), and finally out the chimney, where the rising gases create suction that pulls air through the system. The reuse of heated air yields savings in fuel cost.\n\nAs with the rail process, the BTK process is continuous. A half-dozen labourers working around the clock can fire approximately 15,000\u201325,000 bricks a day. Unlike the rail process, in the BTK process the bricks do not move. Instead, the locations at which the bricks are loaded, fired, and unloaded gradually rotate through the trench.<ref>Pakistan Environmental Protection Agency, [http://www.environment.gov.pk/EA-GLines/I1B-Brick%20Kilns.pdf Brick Kiln Units (PDF file)]</ref>\n\n==== Influences on colour ====\n[[File:London stock brick (bridge).jpg|thumb|Yellow London Stocks at [[London Waterloo station|Waterloo station]]]]\nThe fired colour of tired clay bricks is influenced by the chemical and mineral content of the raw materials, the firing temperature, and the atmosphere in the kiln. For example, pink bricks are the result of a high iron content, white or yellow bricks have a higher lime content. Most bricks burn to various red hues; as the temperature is increased the colour moves through dark red, purple, and then to brown or grey at around {{convert|1300|C|0|abbr=on}}. The names of bricks may reflect their origin and colour, such as [[London stock brick]] and Cambridgeshire White. ''Brick tinting'' may be performed to change the colour of bricks to blend-in areas of brickwork with the surrounding masonry.\n\nAn impervious and ornamental surface may be laid on brick either by [[salt glaze pottery|salt glazing]], in which salt is added during the burning process, or by the use of a [[Slip (ceramics)|slip]], which is a glaze material into which the bricks are dipped. Subsequent reheating in the kiln fuses the slip into a glazed surface integral with the brick base.\n\n=== Chemically set bricks ===\nChemically set bricks are not fired but may have the curing process accelerated by the application of heat and pressure in an autoclave.\n\n==== Calcium-silicate bricks ====\n[[File:Mexitegel.jpg|thumb|left|Swedish Mexitegel is a sand-lime or lime-cement brick.]]\n<!--\n    NB: This is NOT related to the chemical compound \"calcium silicate\"\n    These are bricks made from calcium compounds (lime) and silicate compounds (sand)\n-->\nCalcium-silicate bricks are also called sandlime or flintlime bricks, depending on their ingredients. Rather than being made with clay they are made with [[Lime (mineral)|lime]] binding the silicate material. The raw materials for calcium-silicate bricks include lime mixed in a proportion of about 1 to 10 with sand, [[quartz]], crushed [[flint]], or crushed siliceous rock together with mineral [[colourant]]s. The materials are mixed and left until the lime is completely hydrated; the mixture is then pressed into moulds and cured in an [[autoclave]] for three to fourteen hours to speed the chemical hardening.<ref name=\"EMS\">McArthur, Hugh, and Duncan Spalding. ''Engineering materials science: properties, uses, degradation and remediation''. Chichester, U.K.: Horwood Pub., 2004. 194. Print.</ref> The finished bricks are very accurate and uniform, although the sharp [[arris]]es need careful handling to avoid damage to brick and bricklayer. The bricks can be made in a variety of colours; white, black, buff, and grey-blues are common, and pastel shades can be achieved. This type of brick is common in Sweden, especially in houses built or renovated in the 1970s. In India these are known as [[fly ash brick]]s, manufactured using the FaL-G (fly ash, lime, and gypsum) process. Calcium-silicate bricks are also manufactured in Canada and the United States, and meet the criteria set forth in ASTM C73 \u2013 10 Standard Specification for Calcium Silicate Brick (Sand-Lime Brick).\n\n==== Concrete bricks ====\n{{Main|Concrete masonry unit}}\n[[File:Brickworks in Hainan - cement vessel, maker, stacker 01.jpg|thumb|A concrete brick-making assembly line in [[Guilinyang]] Town, Hainan, China. This operation produces a pallet containing 42 bricks, approximately every 30 seconds.]]\n\nBricks formed from [[concrete]] are usually termed as blocks or [[concrete masonry unit]], and are typically pale grey. They are made from a dry, small aggregate concrete which is formed in steel moulds by vibration and compaction in either an \"egglayer\" or static machine. The finished blocks are cured, rather than fired, using low-pressure steam. Concrete bricks and blocks are manufactured in a wide range of shapes, sizes and face treatments \u2013 a number of which simulate the appearance of clay bricks.\n\nConcrete bricks are available in many colours and as an engineering brick made with sulfate-resisting Portland cement or equivalent. When made with adequate amount of cement they are suitable for harsh environments such as wet conditions and retaining walls. They are made to standards BS 6073, EN 771-3 or ASTM C55. Concrete bricks contract or shrink so they need movement joints every 5 to 6 metres, but are similar to other bricks of similar density in thermal and sound resistance and fire resistance.<ref name=\"EMS\" />\n\n=== Compressed earth blocks ===\n[[File:Brick kiln, Belawadi, Mysore.jpg|thumb|A brick kiln in India]]\n{{Main|Compressed earth block}}\n[[Compressed earth block]]s are made mostly from slightly moistened local soils compressed with a mechanical hydraulic press or manual lever press. A small amount of a cement binder may be added, resulting in a ''stabilised compressed earth block''.\n\n== Optimal dimensions, characteristics, and strength ==\n[[File:comparison_house_brick_size.svg|thumb|left|300px|Comparison of typical brick sizes of assorted countries with isometric projections and dimensions in millimetres]]\n[[File:Brick pile.jpg|thumb|Loose bricks]]\nFor efficient handling and laying, bricks must be small enough and light enough to be picked up by the bricklayer using one hand (leaving the other hand free for the trowel). Bricks are usually laid flat, and as a result, the effective limit on the width of a brick is set by the distance which can conveniently be spanned between the thumb and fingers of one hand, normally about {{convert|100|mm|in|sigfig=1|abbr=on}}. In most cases, the length of a brick is twice its width plus the width of a mortar joint, about {{convert|200|mm|in|sigfig=1|abbr=on}} or slightly more. This allows bricks to be laid ''[[Brickwork|bonded]]'' in a structure which increases stability and strength (for an example, see the illustration of bricks laid in ''English bond'', at the head of this article). The wall is built using alternating courses of ''stretchers'', bricks laid longways, and ''headers'', bricks laid crossways. The headers tie the wall together over its width. In fact, this wall is built in a variation of ''English bond'' called ''English cross bond'' where the successive layers of stretchers are displaced horizontally from each other by half a brick length. In true ''English bond'', the perpendicular lines of the stretcher courses are in line with each other.\n\nA bigger brick makes for a thicker (and thus more insulating) wall. Historically, this meant that bigger bricks were necessary in colder climates (see for instance the slightly larger size of the Russian brick in table below), while a smaller brick was adequate, and more economical, in warmer regions. A notable illustration of this correlation is the [[Green Gate]] in Gdansk; built in 1571 of imported [[Dutch brick]], too small for the colder climate of Gdansk, it was notorious for being a chilly and drafty residence. Nowadays this is no longer an issue, as modern walls typically incorporate specialised insulation materials.\n\nThe correct brick for a job can be selected from a choice of colour, surface texture, density, weight, absorption, and pore structure, thermal characteristics, thermal and moisture movement, and fire resistance.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"clear:left\"\n|+Face brick (\"house brick\") sizes, (alphabetical order)\n!Standard !!Imperial !!Metric\n|-\n|{{AUS}} || 9 \u00d7 4\u2153 \u00d7 3 [[Inch|in]] || 230 \u00d7 110 \u00d7 76&nbsp;[[Millimetre|mm]]\n|-\n|{{DEN}} || 9 \u00d7 4\u00bc \u00d7 2\u00bc in|| 228 \u00d7 108 \u00d7 54&nbsp;mm\n|-\n|{{GER}} || 9 \u00d7 4\u00bc \u00d7 2\u00be in|| 240 \u00d7 115 \u00d7 71&nbsp;mm\n|-\n|{{IND}} || 9 \u00d7 4\u00bc \u00d7 2\u00be in|| 228 \u00d7 107 \u00d7 69&nbsp;mm\n|-\n|{{ROM}} || 9 \u00d7 4\u00bc \u00d7 2\u00bd in|| 240 \u00d7 115 \u00d7 63&nbsp;mm\n|-\n|{{RUS}} || 10 \u00d7 4\u00be \u00d7 2\u00bd in || 250 \u00d7 120 \u00d7 65&nbsp;mm\n|-\n|{{RSA}} || 8\u00be \u00d7 4 \u00d7 3 in|| 222 \u00d7 106 \u00d7 73&nbsp;mm\n|-\n|{{SWE}} || 10 \u00d7 4\u00be \u00d7 2\u00bd in || 250 \u00d7 120 \u00d7 62&nbsp;mm\n|-\n|{{UK}} || 8\u00bd \u00d7 4 \u00d7 2\u00bd in|| 215 \u00d7 102.5 \u00d7 65&nbsp;mm\n|-\n|{{USA}} || 7\u215d \u00d7 3\u215d \u00d7 2\u00bc in|| 194 \u00d7 92 \u00d7 57&nbsp;mm\n|}\n\nIn England, the length and width of the common brick has remained fairly constant over the centuries (but see [[brick tax]]), but the depth has varied from about two inches (about 51&nbsp;mm) or smaller in earlier times to about two and a half inches (about 64&nbsp;mm) more recently.

Standard co-ordinating sizes in length and height (in mm) include 400\u00d7200, 450\u00d7150, 450\u00d7200, 450\u00d7225, 450\u00d7300, 600\u00d7150, 600\u00d7200, and 600\u00d7225; depths (work size, mm) include 60, 75, 90, 100, 115, 140, 150, 190, 200, 225, and 250. They are usable across this range as they are lighter than clay bricks. The density of solid clay bricks is around 2000&nbsp;kg/m\u00b3: this is reduced by frogging, hollow bricks, and so on, but aerated autoclaved concrete, even as a solid brick, can have densities in the range of 450\u2013850&nbsp;kg/m\u00b3.\n\nBricks may also be classified as ''solid'' (less than 25% perforations by volume, although the brick may be \"frogged,\" having indentations on one of the longer faces), ''perforated'' (containing a pattern of small holes through the brick, removing no more than 25% of the volume), ''cellular'' (containing a pattern of holes removing more than 20% of the volume, but closed on one face), or ''hollow'' (containing a pattern of large holes removing more than 25% of the brick's volume). Blocks may be solid, cellular or hollow\n\nThe term \"frog\" can refer to the indentation or the implement used to make it. Modern brickmakers usually use plastic frogs but in the past they were made of wood.\n\n[[File:Vault of Roman Bath in Bath - England.jpg|thumb|upright|Brick arch from a vault in [[Aquae Sulis|Roman Bath]] \u2013 England]]\n[[File:Dixie Highway Maitland.jpg|thumb|left|A brick section of the old [[Dixie Highway]], United States]]\n\nThe compressive strength of bricks produced in the United States ranges from about {{convert|1000|to|15,000|lbf/in2|MPa|0|lk=on|abbr=on|order=flip}}, varying according to the use to which the brick are to be put. In England clay bricks can have strengths of up to 100 MPa, although a common house brick is likely to show a range of 20\u201340 MPa.\n\n== Use ==\nIn the United States, bricks have been used for both buildings and pavements. Examples of brick use in buildings can be seen in colonial era buildings and other notable structures around the country.  Bricks have been used in pavements especially during the late 19th century and early 20th century. The introduction of asphalt and concrete reduced the use of brick pavements, but they are still sometimes installed as a method of [[traffic calming]] or as a decorative surface in [[Pedestrianized zone|pedestrian precincts]]. For example, in the early 1900s, most of the streets in the city of [[Grand Rapids]], [[Michigan]], were paved with bricks. Today, there are only about 20 blocks of brick-paved streets remaining (totalling less than 0.5 percent of all the streets in the city limits).<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20090704104107/http://ostpxweb.dot.gov/preserveamerica/stories/michigan/index.cfm Michigan | Success Stories | Preserve America | Office of the Secretary of Transportation | U.S. Department of Transportation].</ref> Much like in Grand Rapids, municipalities across the United States began replacing brick streets with inexpensive [[asphalt concrete]] by the mid-20th century.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://usatoday30.usatoday.com/news/nation/2003-07-31-brick-roads_x.htm|title=Bricks come back to city streets|last=Schwartz|first=Emma|date=31 July 2003|work=[[USA Today]]|access-date=2017-05-04|archive-url=|archive-date=}}</ref>\n\nBricks in the [[metallurgy]] and [[glass]] industries are often used for lining [[furnace]]s, in particular [[refractory]] bricks such as [[silica]], [[Periclase|magnesia]], [[Grog (clay)|chamotte]] and neutral ([[chromomagnesite]]) [[fire brick|refractory bricks]]. This type of brick must have good [[thermal shock]] resistance, refractoriness under load, high melting point, and satisfactory [[porosity]]. There is a large refractory [[brick industry]], especially in the United Kingdom, Japan, the United States, Belgium and the Netherlands.\n\nIn Northwest Europe, bricks have been used in construction for centuries. Until recently, almost all houses were built almost entirely from bricks. Although many houses are now built using a mixture of [[concrete block]]s and other materials, many houses are skinned with a layer of bricks on the outside for aesthetic appeal.\n\n[[Engineering brick]]s are used where strength, low water porosity or acid (flue gas) resistance are needed.\n\nIn the UK a [[red brick university]] is one founded in the late 19th or early 20th century. The term is used to refer to such institutions collectively to distinguish them from the older [[Oxbridge]] institutions, and refers to the use of bricks, as opposed to stone, in their buildings.\n\nColombian architect [[Rogelio Salmona]] was noted for his extensive use of red bricks in his buildings and for using natural shapes like spirals, radial geometry and curves in his designs.<ref>{{cite news| url=https://www.nytimes.com/2007/10/06/arts/06salmona.html?_r=1&ref=obituaries&oref=slogin | work=The New York Times | first=Simon | last=Romero | title=Rogelio Salmona, Colombian Architect Who Transformed Cities, Is Dead at 78 | date=6 October 2007}}</ref> Most buildings in [[Colombia]] are made of brick, given the abundance of clay in equatorial countries like this one.\n\n== Limitations ==\nStarting in the 20th century, the use of brickwork declined in some areas due to concerns with earthquakes. Earthquakes such as the [[1906 San Francisco earthquake|San Francisco earthquake of 1906]] and the [[1933 Long Beach earthquake]] revealed the weaknesses of unreinforced brick masonry in earthquake-prone areas. During seismic events, the mortar cracks and crumbles, and the bricks are no longer held together. Brick masonry with steel reinforcement, which helps hold the masonry together during earthquakes, was used to replace many of the unreinforced masonry buildings. Retrofitting older unreinforced masonry structures has been mandated in many jurisdictions.\n{{wide image|San Francisco earthquake.jpg|1600px|A panorama after the [[1906 San Francisco earthquake]].|100%|center}}\n\n== Gallery ==\n<gallery>\nFile:Pergamonmuseum Babylon Ischtar-Tor.jpg|[[Ishtar Gate]] of [[Babylon]] in the [[Pergamon Museum]], [[Berlin]], [[Germany]]\nFile:Opus reticulatum 2.JPG|Roman [[opus reticulatum]] on Hadrian's Villa in [[Tivoli, Italy]] (2nd century)\nFile:Munich Frauenkirche.jpg|[[Frauenkirche (Munich)|Frauenkirche]], [[Munich]], [[Germany]], erected 1468\u20131488, looking up at the towers\nFile:Torun sw Jakub szczyt zach.JPG|Eastern gable of church of St. James in [[Toru\u0144]] (14th century)\nFile:Radzyn Chelm zamek zendrowka.jpg|Decorative pattern made of strongly fired bricks in [[Radzy\u0144 Che\u0142mi\u0144ski|Radzy\u0144]] Castle (14th century)\nFile:Teruel - Torre de San Mart\u00edn.jpg|[[Mud\u00e9jar]] brick church tower in [[Teruel]], [[Spain]], (14th century)\nFile:thornbury.twochimneys.arp.750pix.jpg|Brick sculpting on [[Thornbury Castle]], Thornbury, near [[Bristol]], England.

Traditionally, the term brick referred to a unit composed of [[clay]], but it is now used to denote rectangular units made of clay-bearing soil, sand, and [[Lime (material)|lime]], or [[concrete]] materials. Bricks can be joined together using [[Mortar (masonry)|mortar]], adhesives or by interlocking them.<ref>[https://www.buildupnepal.com/interlocking-bricks/ Interlocking bricks used in Nepal]</ref><ref>[https://vlaanderen-circulair.be/en/cases-in-flanders/detail/facadeclick Bricks that interlock]</ref> Bricks are produced in numerous classes, types, materials, and sizes which vary with region and time period, and are produced in bulk quantities. Two basic categories of bricks are ''fired'' and ''non-fired'' bricks.\n\n[[Concrete masonry unit|''Block'']] is a similar term referring to a rectangular building unit composed of similar materials, but is usually larger than a brick. Lightweight bricks (also called lightweight blocks) are made from [[expanded clay aggregate]].\n\nFired bricks are one of the longest-lasting and strongest [[building material]]s, sometimes referred to as artificial stone, and have been used since circa 4000 BC. Air-dried bricks, also known as [[mudbrick]]s, have a history older than fired bricks, and have an additional ingredient of a mechanical binder such as straw.\n\nBricks are laid in ''courses'' and numerous patterns known as ''bonds'', collectively known as [[brickwork]], and may be laid in various kinds of [[mortar (masonry)|mortar]] to hold the bricks together to make a durable structure.\n\n== History ==\n[[File:Historic brick street in Natchitoches, LA IMG 1943.JPG|thumb|left|Bricked Front Street along the [[Cane River]] in historic [[Natchitoches, Louisiana|Natchitoches]], [[Louisiana]]]]\n\n=== Middle East and South Asia ===\n[[File:Subrahmanya Temple, Saluvanakuppam front view.jpg|thumb|left|Remains of 3rd century BC [[Murugan Temple, Saluvankuppam|Hindu brick temple]], Tamil Nadu, India]]\n[[File:Shebli2.jpg|thumb|upright|The brickwork of [[Shebeli Tower]] in [[Iran]] displays 12th-century craftsmanship]]\n[[File:JetawanaStupa1.JPG|thumb|upright|left|The ancient [[Jetavanaramaya]] [[stupa]] in [[Anuradhapura]], [[Sri Lanka]] is one of the largest brick structures in the world.]]\nThe earliest bricks were ''dried brick'', meaning that they were formed from clay-bearing earth or mud and dried (usually in the sun) until they were strong enough for use.

An independent style of brick architecture, known as [[brick Gothic]] (similar to [[Gothic architecture]]) flourished in places that lacked indigenous sources of rocks. Examples of this architectural style can be found in modern-day [[Denmark]], [[Germany]], [[Poland]], and [[Russia]].\n\nThis style evolved into [[List of Brick Renaissance buildings|Brick Renaissance]] as the stylistic changes associated with the [[Italian Renaissance]] spread to northern Europe, leading to the adoption of [[Renaissance architecture|Renaissance]] elements into brick building. A clear distinction between the two styles only developed at the transition to [[Baroque architecture]]. In [[L\u00fcbeck]], for example, Brick Renaissance is clearly recognisable in buildings equipped with terracotta reliefs by the artist Statius von D\u00fcren, who was also active at [[Schwerin]] ([[Schwerin Castle]]) and [[Wismar]] (F\u00fcrstenhof).\n\nLong-distance [[bulk transport]] of bricks and other construction equipment remained prohibitively expensive until the development of modern transportation infrastructure, with the construction of [[canal]], [[road]]s, and [[railway]]s.\n\n=== Industrial era ===\nProduction of bricks increased massively with the onset of the [[Industrial Revolution]] and the rise in factory building in England. For reasons of speed and economy, bricks were increasingly preferred as building material to stone, even in areas where the stone was readily available. It was at this time in [[London]] that bright red brick was chosen for construction to make the buildings more visible in the heavy fog and to help prevent traffic accidents.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=3ZQl3C5BAHsC|title=London the Biography|author=Peter Ackroyd|page=435|publisher=Random House|year=2001|isbn=978-0-09-942258-7}}</ref>\n\nThe transition from the traditional method of production known as hand-moulding to a mechanised form of mass-production slowly took place during the first half of the nineteenth century. Possibly the first successful brick-making machine was [[patent]]ed by Henry Clayton, employed at the Atlas Works in [[Middlesex]], England, in 1855, and was capable of producing up to 25,000 bricks daily with minimal supervision.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.google.com/patents/US13123|title=Henry Clayton|accessdate=17 December 2012}}</ref> His mechanical apparatus soon achieved widespread attention after it was adopted for use by the [[South Eastern Railway, UK|South Eastern Railway Company]] for brick-making at their factory near [[Folkestone]].<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=S54AAAAAMAAJ&printsec=frontcover&pg=GBS.PA361|title=The Mechanics Magazine and Journal of Engineering, Agricultural Machinery, Manufactures and Shipbuilding|year=1859|page=361}}</ref> The [[Bradley & Craven Ltd]] 'Stiff-Plastic Brickmaking Machine' was patented in 1853, apparently predating Clayton.

The use of brick for [[skyscraper]] construction severely limited the size of the building \u2013 the [[Monadnock Building]], built in 1896 in Chicago, required exceptionally thick walls to maintain the structural integrity of its 17 storeys.\n\nFollowing pioneering work in the 1950s at the [[ETH Zurich|Swiss Federal Institute of Technology]] and the [[Building Research Establishment]] in [[Watford]], UK, the use of improved masonry for the construction of tall structures up to 18 storeys high was made viable. However, the use of brick has largely remained restricted to small to medium-sized buildings, as steel and concrete remain superior materials for high-rise construction.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dehoopsteenwerwe.co.za/information03.html|title=The History of Bricks|publisher=De Hoop:Steenwerve Brickfields}}</ref>\n\n== Types ==\n[[File:2008 BeaconHill Boston 2302897829.jpg|thumb|This wall in [[Beacon Hill, Boston]] shows different types of brickwork and stone foundations]]\nThere are thousands of types of bricks that are named for their use, size, forming method, origin, quality, texture, and/or materials.\n\nCategorized by manufacture method:\n* Extruded \u2013 made by being forced through an opening in a steel die, with a very consistent size and shape.\n** Wire-cut \u2013 cut to size after extrusion with a tensioned wire which may leave drag marks\n* Moulded \u2013 shaped in moulds rather than being extruded\n** Machine-moulded \u2013 clay is forced into moulds using pressure\n** Handmade \u2013 clay is forced into moulds by a person\n* Dry-pressed \u2013 similar to soft mud method, but starts with a much thicker clay mix and is compressed with great force.\n\nCategorized by use:\n* Common or building \u2013 A brick not intended to be visible, used for internal structure\n* Face \u2013 A brick used on exterior surfaces to present a clean appearance\n* Hollow \u2013 not solid, the holes are less than 25% of the brick volume\n** Perforated \u2013 holes greater than 25% of the brick volume\n* Keyed \u2013 indentations in at least one face and end to be used with rendering and plastering\n* Paving \u2013 brick intended to be in ground contact as a walkway or roadway\n* Thin \u2013 brick with normal height and length but thin width to be used as a veneer\n\nSpecialized use bricks:\n* Chemically resistant \u2013 bricks made with resistance to chemicals\n** [[Acid brick]] \u2013 acid resistant bricks\n* [[Engineering brick|Engineering]] \u2013 a type of hard, dense, brick used where strength, low water porosity or acid (flue gas) resistance are needed.

Each type is manufactured differently.\n\n=== Mudbrick ===\n{{Main|Mudbrick}}\nUnfired bricks, also known as [[mudbrick]]s, are made from a wet, clay-containing soil mixed with straw or similar binders. They are air-dried until ready for use.\n\n=== Fired brick ===\n[[File:Brick making in Java.jpg|thumb|upright|Raw bricks sun-drying before being fired|alt=]]\nFired bricks are burned in a kiln which makes them durable. Modern, fired, clay bricks are formed in one of three processes \u2013 soft mud, dry press, or extruded. Depending on the country, either the extruded or soft mud method is the most common, since they are the most economical.\n\nNormally, bricks contain the following ingredients:<ref name=\"punmia\">{{Citation|author1=Punmia, B.C. |author2=Jain, Ashok Kumar |title=Basic Civil Engineering |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=sWZxu_muxyIC&pg=PA33 |year= 2003  |isbn=978-81-7008-403-7 |page=33}}</ref>\n\n# Silica (sand) \u2013 50% to 60% by weight\n# Alumina (clay) \u2013 20% to 30% by weight\n# Lime \u2013 2 to 5% by weight\n# Iron oxide \u2013 \u2264 7% by weight\n# Magnesia \u2013 less than 1% by weight\n\n====Shaping methods====\nThree main methods are used for shaping the raw materials into bricks to be fired:\n\n* Molded bricks \u2013 These bricks start with raw clay, preferably in a mix with 25\u201330% sand to reduce shrinkage. The clay is first ground and mixed with water to the desired consistency. The clay is then pressed into steel moulds with a [[Hydraulics|hydraulic]] press. The shaped clay is then fired (\"burned\") at 900\u20131000&nbsp;\u00b0C to achieve strength.\n* Dry-pressed bricks \u2013 The dry-press method is similar to the soft-mud moulded method, but starts with a much thicker clay mix, so it forms more accurate, sharper-edged bricks. The greater force in pressing and the longer burn make this method more expensive.\n* Extruded bricks \u2013 For extruded bricks the clay is mixed with 10\u201315% [[water]] (stiff extrusion) or 20\u201325% water (soft extrusion) in a [[pugmill]]. This mixture is forced through a [[Die (manufacturing)|die]] to create a long cable of material of the desired width and depth. This mass is then cut into bricks of the desired length by a wall of wires. Most structural bricks are made by this method as it produces hard, dense bricks, and suitable dies can produce perforations as well. The introduction of such holes reduces the volume of clay needed, and hence the cost. Hollow bricks are lighter and easier to handle, and have different thermal properties from solid bricks. The cut bricks are hardened by drying for 20 to 40 hours at 50 to 150&nbsp;\u00b0C before being fired. The heat for drying is often waste heat from the kiln.\n\n==== Kilns ====\n[[File:Raw Indian brick.jpg|thumb|Raw (green) Indian brick]]\n[[File:Xhosa brickmaker at kiln near Ngcobo.jpg|thumb|left|[[Xhosa people|Xhosa]] brickmaker at kiln near [[Ngcobo]] in 2007]]\n[[File:A brickmaker - Tashrih al-aqvam (1825), f.253v - BL Add. 27255.jpg|thumb|A brickmaker in India \u2013 ''Tashrih al-aqvam'' (1825)]]\nIn many modern [[brickworks]], bricks are usually fired in a continuously fired tunnel kiln, in which the bricks are fired as they move slowly through the kiln on [[conveyors]], rails, or kiln cars, which achieves a more consistent brick product. The bricks often have [[Lime (material)|lime]], ash, and organic matter added, which accelerates the burning process.\n\nThe other major kiln type is the Bull's Trench Kiln (BTK), based on a design developed by British engineer W. Bull in the late 19th century.\n\nAn oval or circular trench is dug, 6\u20139 metres wide, 2-2.5 metres deep, and 100\u2013150 metres in circumference. A tall exhaust chimney is constructed in the centre. Half or more of the trench is filled with \"green\" (unfired) bricks which are stacked in an open lattice pattern to allow airflow. The lattice is capped with a roofing layer of finished brick.\n\nIn operation, new green bricks, along with roofing bricks, are stacked at one end of the brick pile. Historically, a stack of unfired bricks covered for protection from the weather was called a \"hack\".<ref>Connolly, Andrew. ''Life in the Victorian Brickyards of Flintshire and Denbigshire'', p34. 2003, Gwasg Carreg Gwalch.</ref> Cooled finished bricks are removed from the other end for transport to their destinations. In the middle, the brick workers create a firing zone by dropping fuel (coal, wood, oil, debris, and so on) through access holes in the roof above the trench.\n\nThe advantage of the BTK design is a much greater energy efficiency compared with [[clamp kiln|clamp]] or [[scove kiln]]s. Sheet metal or boards are used to route the airflow through the brick lattice so that fresh air flows first through the recently burned bricks, heating the air, then through the active burning zone. The air continues through the green brick zone (pre-heating and drying the bricks), and finally out the chimney, where the rising gases create suction that pulls air through the system. The reuse of heated air yields savings in fuel cost.\n\nAs with the rail process, the BTK process is continuous. A half-dozen labourers working around the clock can fire approximately 15,000\u201325,000 bricks a day. Unlike the rail process, in the BTK process the bricks do not move. Instead, the locations at which the bricks are loaded, fired, and unloaded gradually rotate through the trench.<ref>Pakistan Environmental Protection Agency, [http://www.environment.gov.pk/EA-GLines/I1B-Brick%20Kilns.pdf Brick Kiln Units (PDF file)]</ref>\n\n==== Influences on colour ====\n[[File:London stock brick (bridge).jpg|thumb|Yellow London Stocks at [[London Waterloo station|Waterloo station]]]]\nThe fired colour of tired clay bricks is influenced by the chemical and mineral content of the raw materials, the firing temperature, and the atmosphere in the kiln. For example, pink bricks are the result of a high iron content, white or yellow bricks have a higher lime content. Most bricks burn to various red hues; as the temperature is increased the colour moves through dark red, purple, and then to brown or grey at around {{convert|1300|C|0|abbr=on}}. The names of bricks may reflect their origin and colour, such as [[London stock brick]] and Cambridgeshire White. ''Brick tinting'' may be performed to change the colour of bricks to blend-in areas of brickwork with the surrounding masonry.\n\nAn impervious and ornamental surface may be laid on brick either by [[salt glaze pottery|salt glazing]], in which salt is added during the burning process, or by the use of a [[Slip (ceramics)|slip]], which is a glaze material into which the bricks are dipped. Subsequent reheating in the kiln fuses the slip into a glazed surface integral with the brick base.\n\n=== Chemically set bricks ===\nChemically set bricks are not fired but may have the curing process accelerated by the application of heat and pressure in an autoclave.\n\n==== Calcium-silicate bricks ====\n[[File:Mexitegel.jpg|thumb|left|Swedish Mexitegel is a sand-lime or lime-cement brick.]]\n<!--\n    NB: This is NOT related to the chemical compound \"calcium silicate\"\n    These are bricks made from calcium compounds (lime) and silicate compounds (sand)\n-->\nCalcium-silicate bricks are also called sandlime or flintlime bricks, depending on their ingredients. Rather than being made with clay they are made with [[Lime (mineral)|lime]] binding the silicate material. The raw materials for calcium-silicate bricks include lime mixed in a proportion of about 1 to 10 with sand, [[quartz]], crushed [[flint]], or crushed siliceous rock together with mineral [[colourant]]s. The materials are mixed and left until the lime is completely hydrated; the mixture is then pressed into moulds and cured in an [[autoclave]] for three to fourteen hours to speed the chemical hardening.<ref name=\"EMS\">McArthur, Hugh, and Duncan Spalding. ''Engineering materials science: properties, uses, degradation and remediation''. Chichester, U.K.: Horwood Pub., 2004. 194. Print.</ref> The finished bricks are very accurate and uniform, although the sharp [[arris]]es need careful handling to avoid damage to brick and bricklayer. The bricks can be made in a variety of colours; white, black, buff, and grey-blues are common, and pastel shades can be achieved. This type of brick is common in Sweden, especially in houses built or renovated in the 1970s. In India these are known as [[fly ash brick]]s, manufactured using the FaL-G (fly ash, lime, and gypsum) process. Calcium-silicate bricks are also manufactured in Canada and the United States, and meet the criteria set forth in ASTM C73 \u2013 10 Standard Specification for Calcium Silicate Brick (Sand-Lime Brick).\n\n==== Concrete bricks ====\n{{Main|Concrete masonry unit}}\n[[File:Brickworks in Hainan - cement vessel, maker, stacker 01.jpg|thumb|A concrete brick-making assembly line in [[Guilinyang]] Town, Hainan, China. This operation produces a pallet containing 42 bricks, approximately every 30 seconds.]]\n\nBricks formed from [[concrete]] are usually termed as blocks or [[concrete masonry unit]], and are typically pale grey. They are made from a dry, small aggregate concrete which is formed in steel moulds by vibration and compaction in either an \"egglayer\" or static machine. The finished blocks are cured, rather than fired, using low-pressure steam. Concrete bricks and blocks are manufactured in a wide range of shapes, sizes and face treatments \u2013 a number of which simulate the appearance of clay bricks.\n\nConcrete bricks are available in many colours and as an engineering brick made with sulfate-resisting Portland cement or equivalent. When made with adequate amount of cement they are suitable for harsh environments such as wet conditions and retaining walls. They are made to standards BS 6073, EN 771-3 or ASTM C55. Concrete bricks contract or shrink so they need movement joints every 5 to 6 metres, but are similar to other bricks of similar density in thermal and sound resistance and fire resistance.<ref name=\"EMS\" />\n\n=== Compressed earth blocks ===\n[[File:Brick kiln, Belawadi, Mysore.jpg|thumb|A brick kiln in India]]\n{{Main|Compressed earth block}}\n[[Compressed earth block]]s are made mostly from slightly moistened local soils compressed with a mechanical hydraulic press or manual lever press. A small amount of a cement binder may be added, resulting in a ''stabilised compressed earth block''.\n\n== Optimal dimensions, characteristics, and strength ==\n[[File:comparison_house_brick_size.svg|thumb|left|300px|Comparison of typical brick sizes of assorted countries with isometric projections and dimensions in millimetres]]\n[[File:Brick pile.jpg|thumb|Loose bricks]]\nFor efficient handling and laying, bricks must be small enough and light enough to be picked up by the bricklayer using one hand (leaving the other hand free for the trowel). Bricks are usually laid flat, and as a result, the effective limit on the width of a brick is set by the distance which can conveniently be spanned between the thumb and fingers of one hand, normally about {{convert|100|mm|in|sigfig=1|abbr=on}}. In most cases, the length of a brick is twice its width plus the width of a mortar joint, about {{convert|200|mm|in|sigfig=1|abbr=on}} or slightly more. This allows bricks to be laid ''[[Brickwork|bonded]]'' in a structure which increases stability and strength (for an example, see the illustration of bricks laid in ''English bond'', at the head of this article). The wall is built using alternating courses of ''stretchers'', bricks laid longways, and ''headers'', bricks laid crossways. The headers tie the wall together over its width. In fact, this wall is built in a variation of ''English bond'' called ''English cross bond'' where the successive layers of stretchers are displaced horizontally from each other by half a brick length. In true ''English bond'', the perpendicular lines of the stretcher courses are in line with each other.\n\nA bigger brick makes for a thicker (and thus more insulating) wall. Historically, this meant that bigger bricks were necessary in colder climates (see for instance the slightly larger size of the Russian brick in table below), while a smaller brick was adequate, and more economical, in warmer regions. A notable illustration of this correlation is the [[Green Gate]] in Gdansk; built in 1571 of imported [[Dutch brick]], too small for the colder climate of Gdansk, it was notorious for being a chilly and drafty residence. Nowadays this is no longer an issue, as modern walls typically incorporate specialised insulation materials.\n\nThe correct brick for a job can be selected from a choice of colour, surface texture, density, weight, absorption, and pore structure, thermal characteristics, thermal and moisture movement, and fire resistance.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"clear:left\"\n|+Face brick (\"house brick\") sizes, (alphabetical order)\n!Standard !!Imperial !!Metric\n|-\n|{{AUS}} || 9 \u00d7 4\u2153 \u00d7 3 [[Inch|in]] || 230 \u00d7 110 \u00d7 76&nbsp;[[Millimetre|mm]]\n|-\n|{{DEN}} || 9 \u00d7 4\u00bc \u00d7 2\u00bc in|| 228 \u00d7 108 \u00d7 54&nbsp;mm\n|-\n|{{GER}} || 9 \u00d7 4\u00bc \u00d7 2\u00be in|| 240 \u00d7 115 \u00d7 71&nbsp;mm\n|-\n|{{IND}} || 9 \u00d7 4\u00bc \u00d7 2\u00be in|| 228 \u00d7 107 \u00d7 69&nbsp;mm\n|-\n|{{ROM}} || 9 \u00d7 4\u00bc \u00d7 2\u00bd in|| 240 \u00d7 115 \u00d7 63&nbsp;mm\n|-\n|{{RUS}} || 10 \u00d7 4\u00be \u00d7 2\u00bd in || 250 \u00d7 120 \u00d7 65&nbsp;mm\n|-\n|{{RSA}} || 8\u00be \u00d7 4 \u00d7 3 in|| 222 \u00d7 106 \u00d7 73&nbsp;mm\n|-\n|{{SWE}} || 10 \u00d7 4\u00be \u00d7 2\u00bd in || 250 \u00d7 120 \u00d7 62&nbsp;mm\n|-\n|{{UK}} || 8\u00bd \u00d7 4 \u00d7 2\u00bd in|| 215 \u00d7 102.5 \u00d7 65&nbsp;mm\n|-\n|{{USA}} || 7\u215d \u00d7 3\u215d \u00d7 2\u00bc in|| 194 \u00d7 92 \u00d7 57&nbsp;mm\n|}\n\nIn England, the length and width of the common brick has remained fairly constant over the centuries (but see [[brick tax]]), but the depth has varied from about two inches (about 51&nbsp;mm) or smaller in earlier times to about two and a half inches (about 64&nbsp;mm) more recently. In the [[United Kingdom]], the usual size of a modern brick is 215 \u00d7 102.5 \u00d7 65&nbsp;mm (about {{frac|8|5|8}} \u00d7 {{frac|4|1|8}} \u00d7 {{frac|2|5|8}}&nbsp;inches), which, with a nominal 10&nbsp;mm ({{frac|3|8}}&nbsp;inch) mortar joint, forms a ''[[unit size]]'' of 225 \u00d7 112.5 \u00d7 75&nbsp;mm (9 \u00d7 {{frac|4|1|2}} \u00d7 3&nbsp;inches), for a ratio of 6:3:2.\n\nIn the United States, modern standard bricks are specified for various uses;<ref>[http://www.gobrick.com/portals/25/docs/technical%20notes/tn9a.pdf].

Standard co-ordinating sizes in length and height (in mm) include 400\u00d7200, 450\u00d7150, 450\u00d7200, 450\u00d7225, 450\u00d7300, 600\u00d7150, 600\u00d7200, and 600\u00d7225; depths (work size, mm) include 60, 75, 90, 100, 115, 140, 150, 190, 200, 225, and 250. They are usable across this range as they are lighter than clay bricks. The density of solid clay bricks is around 2000&nbsp;kg/m\u00b3: this is reduced by frogging, hollow bricks, and so on, but aerated autoclaved concrete, even as a solid brick, can have densities in the range of 450\u2013850&nbsp;kg/m\u00b3.\n\nBricks may also be classified as ''solid'' (less than 25% perforations by volume, although the brick may be \"frogged,\" having indentations on one of the longer faces), ''perforated'' (containing a pattern of small holes through the brick, removing no more than 25% of the volume), ''cellular'' (containing a pattern of holes removing more than 20% of the volume, but closed on one face), or ''hollow'' (containing a pattern of large holes removing more than 25% of the brick's volume). Blocks may be solid, cellular or hollow\n\nThe term \"frog\" can refer to the indentation or the implement used to make it. Modern brickmakers usually use plastic frogs but in the past they were made of wood.\n\n[[File:Vault of Roman Bath in Bath - England.jpg|thumb|upright|Brick arch from a vault in [[Aquae Sulis|Roman Bath]] \u2013 England]]\n[[File:Dixie Highway Maitland.jpg|thumb|left|A brick section of the old [[Dixie Highway]], United States]]\n\nThe compressive strength of bricks produced in the United States ranges from about {{convert|1000|to|15,000|lbf/in2|MPa|0|lk=on|abbr=on|order=flip}}, varying according to the use to which the brick are to be put. In England clay bricks can have strengths of up to 100 MPa, although a common house brick is likely to show a range of 20\u201340 MPa.\n\n== Use ==\nIn the United States, bricks have been used for both buildings and pavements. Examples of brick use in buildings can be seen in colonial era buildings and other notable structures around the country.  Bricks have been used in pavements especially during the late 19th century and early 20th century. The introduction of asphalt and concrete reduced the use of brick pavements, but they are still sometimes installed as a method of [[traffic calming]] or as a decorative surface in [[Pedestrianized zone|pedestrian precincts]]. For example, in the early 1900s, most of the streets in the city of [[Grand Rapids]], [[Michigan]], were paved with bricks. Today, there are only about 20 blocks of brick-paved streets remaining (totalling less than 0.5 percent of all the streets in the city limits).<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20090704104107/http://ostpxweb.dot.gov/preserveamerica/stories/michigan/index.cfm Michigan | Success Stories | Preserve America | Office of the Secretary of Transportation | U.S. Department of Transportation].</ref> Much like in Grand Rapids, municipalities across the United States began replacing brick streets with inexpensive [[asphalt concrete]] by the mid-20th century.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://usatoday30.usatoday.com/news/nation/2003-07-31-brick-roads_x.htm|title=Bricks come back to city streets|last=Schwartz|first=Emma|date=31 July 2003|work=[[USA Today]]|access-date=2017-05-04|archive-url=|archive-date=}}</ref>\n\nBricks in the [[metallurgy]] and [[glass]] industries are often used for lining [[furnace]]s, in particular [[refractory]] bricks such as [[silica]], [[Periclase|magnesia]], [[Grog (clay)|chamotte]] and neutral ([[chromomagnesite]]) [[fire brick|refractory bricks]]. This type of brick must have good [[thermal shock]] resistance, refractoriness under load, high melting point, and satisfactory [[porosity]]. There is a large refractory [[brick industry]], especially in the United Kingdom, Japan, the United States, Belgium and the Netherlands.\n\nIn Northwest Europe, bricks have been used in construction for centuries. Until recently, almost all houses were built almost entirely from bricks. Although many houses are now built using a mixture of [[concrete block]]s and other materials, many houses are skinned with a layer of bricks on the outside for aesthetic appeal.\n\n[[Engineering brick]]s are used where strength, low water porosity or acid (flue gas) resistance are needed.\n\nIn the UK a [[red brick university]] is one founded in the late 19th or early 20th century. The term is used to refer to such institutions collectively to distinguish them from the older [[Oxbridge]] institutions, and refers to the use of bricks, as opposed to stone, in their buildings.\n\nColombian architect [[Rogelio Salmona]] was noted for his extensive use of red bricks in his buildings and for using natural shapes like spirals, radial geometry and curves in his designs.<ref>{{cite news| url=https://www.nytimes.com/2007/10/06/arts/06salmona.html?_r=1&ref=obituaries&oref=slogin | work=The New York Times | first=Simon | last=Romero | title=Rogelio Salmona, Colombian Architect Who Transformed Cities, Is Dead at 78 | date=6 October 2007}}</ref> Most buildings in [[Colombia]] are made of brick, given the abundance of clay in equatorial countries like this one.\n\n== Limitations ==\nStarting in the 20th century, the use of brickwork declined in some areas due to concerns with earthquakes. Earthquakes such as the [[1906 San Francisco earthquake|San Francisco earthquake of 1906]] and the [[1933 Long Beach earthquake]] revealed the weaknesses of unreinforced brick masonry in earthquake-prone areas. During seismic events, the mortar cracks and crumbles, and the bricks are no longer held together. Brick masonry with steel reinforcement, which helps hold the masonry together during earthquakes, was used to replace many of the unreinforced masonry buildings. Retrofitting older unreinforced masonry structures has been mandated in many jurisdictions.\n{{wide image|San Francisco earthquake.jpg|1600px|A panorama after the [[1906 San Francisco earthquake]].|100%|center}}\n\n== Gallery ==\n<gallery>\nFile:Pergamonmuseum Babylon Ischtar-Tor.jpg|[[Ishtar Gate]] of [[Babylon]] in the [[Pergamon Museum]], [[Berlin]], [[Germany]]\nFile:Opus reticulatum 2.JPG|Roman [[opus reticulatum]] on Hadrian's Villa in [[Tivoli, Italy]] (2nd century)\nFile:Munich Frauenkirche.jpg|[[Frauenkirche (Munich)|Frauenkirche]], [[Munich]], [[Germany]], erected 1468\u20131488, looking up at the towers\nFile:Torun sw Jakub szczyt zach.JPG|Eastern gable of church of St. James in [[Toru\u0144]] (14th century)\nFile:Radzyn Chelm zamek zendrowka.jpg|Decorative pattern made of strongly fired bricks in [[Radzy\u0144 Che\u0142mi\u0144ski|Radzy\u0144]] Castle (14th century)\nFile:Teruel - Torre de San Mart\u00edn.jpg|[[Mud\u00e9jar]] brick church tower in [[Teruel]], [[Spain]], (14th century)\nFile:thornbury.twochimneys.arp.750pix.jpg|Brick sculpting on [[Thornbury Castle]], Thornbury, near [[Bristol]], England.

It was designed by the [[Soviet Union]]'s [[Mikoyan|Mikoyan-Gurevich]] bureau and is one of the few combat aircraft built primarily using [[stainless steel]]. It was the last plane designed by [[Mikhail Gurevich (aircraft designer)|Mikhail Gurevich]] before his retirement.<ref name=\"Flieger\">{{cite journal|author=L. Egenburg, A.

It has an operational top speed of [[Mach number|Mach]] 2.83 (Mach 3.2 is possible but at risk of significant damage to the engines) and features a powerful [[radar]] and four [[air-to-air missile]]s. When first seen in reconnaissance photography, the large wing suggested an enormous and highly maneuverable fighter, at a time when U.S. [[Energy\u2013maneuverability theory|design theories were also evolving towards higher maneuverability]] due to combat performance in the [[Vietnam War]]. The appearance of the MiG-25 sparked serious concern in the [[Western world|West]] and prompted dramatic increases in performance for the [[McDonnell Douglas F-15 Eagle]] then under development in the late 1960s. The capabilities of the MiG-25 were better understood in 1976 when Soviet pilot [[Viktor Belenko]] defected in a MiG-25 to the United States via [[Japan]]. It turned out that the aircraft's weight necessitated its large wings.\n\nProduction of the MiG-25 series ended in 1984 after completion of 1,186 aircraft. A symbol of the Cold War, the MiG-25 flew with Soviet allies and former Soviet republics, remaining in limited service in several export customers.

In the decades after World War II, this meant not only dealing with accidental border violations, but more importantly defending the vast airspace of the USSR against US [[reconnaissance aircraft]] and [[strategic bomber]]s carrying free-fall nuclear bombs. The performance of these types of aircraft was steadily improved.  Overflights by the very high altitude American [[Lockheed U-2]] in the late 1950s revealed a need for higher altitude interceptor aircraft than currently available.<ref>Rich and Janos 1994, p. 15.</ref>\n\nThe subsonic [[Boeing B-47 Stratojet]] and [[Boeing B-52 Stratofortress]] strategic bombers were followed by the Mach&nbsp;2 [[Convair B-58 Hustler]], with the Mach&nbsp;3 [[North American XB-70 Valkyrie|North American B-70 Valkyrie]] on the drawing board at that time. A major upgrade in the PVO defence system was required,<ref>{{cite web|title=MiG-25 Foxbat was specifically designed to intercept the XB-70 Valkyrie|url=http://www.militaryfactory.com/aircraft/detail.asp?aircraft_id=64|website=militaryfactory dot com|publisher=Military Factory|accessdate=6 December 2016}}</ref> and, at the start of 1958, a requirement was issued for manned interceptors capable of reaching 3,000&nbsp;km/h (1,864&nbsp;mph) and heights of up to 27&nbsp;km (88,583&nbsp;ft). Mikoyan and Sukhoi responded.<ref>Gordon and Gunston 2000, p. 166.</ref>\n\n[[File:Mikoyan-Gurevich Ye-152 and Ye-152M top-view silhouette comparison.jpg|thumb|YE-152 and YE-152M experimental interceptor]]\nThe Mikoyan-Gurevich [[OKB]] had been working on a series of interceptors during the second half of the 1950s: the I-1, I-3U, I-7U, I-75, Ye-150, Ye-150A, [[Mikoyan-Gurevich Ye-152|Ye-152]], Ye-152A, Ye-152P, and Ye-152M. The Ye-150 was noteworthy because it was built specifically to test the [[Tumansky R-15]] engine, two of which would later be used for the MiG-25.  This led to Ye-152, alternatively known as Ye-166, which set several world records.<ref>Gordon and Gunston 2000, p. 106.</ref> The Ye-152M (converted from one of the two Ye-152 aircraft) was intended to be the definite heavy interceptor design. But before it was finished, the PVO had selected the [[Tupolev Tu-128]]. As the work on the MiG-25 was well under way, the single-engine Ye-152M was abandoned.\n\n===Designing a new interceptor===\nWork on the new Soviet interceptor that became the MiG-25 started in mid-1959,<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/> a year before Soviet intelligence learned of the American Mach 3 [[Lockheed A-12|A-12]] reconnaissance aircraft.<ref name=\"Great Book\">Spick 2000</ref> It is not clear if the design was influenced by the American [[North American A-5 Vigilante|A-5 Vigilante]].<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/>\n\nThe design bureau studied several possible layouts for the new aircraft. One had the engines located side by side, as on the [[MiG-19]]. The second had a stepped arrangement with one engine amidships, with exhaust under the fuselage, and another in the aft fuselage. The third project had an engine arrangement similar to that of the [[English Electric Lightning]], with two engines stacked vertically. Option two and three were both rejected because the size of the engines meant any of them would result in a very tall aircraft which would complicate maintenance.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/>\n\nThe idea of placing the engines in underwing nacelles was also rejected because of the dangers of any thrust asymmetry during flight. Having decided on engine configuration, there was thought of giving the machine [[variable-sweep wing]]s and a second crew member, a navigator. Variable geometry would improve maneuverability at subsonic speed, but at the cost of decreased fuel tank capacity. Because the reconnaissance aircraft would operate at high speed and high altitude, the idea was soon dropped. Another interesting but impractical idea was to improve the field performance using two RD36-35 lift-jets. Vertical takeoff and landing would allow for use of damaged runways during wartime and was studied on both sides of the [[Iron Curtain]]. The perennial problem with engines dedicated to vertical lift is they become mere dead weight in horizontal flight and also occupy space in the airframe needed for fuel. The MiG interceptor would need all the fuel it could get, so the idea was abandoned.<ref name=\"WAPJ34 p108\"/>\n\n[[File:Ye-155.png|thumb|left|Ye-155R3 Reconnaissance prototype with a 5,280-litre drop tank under the belly, 1964]]\nThe first prototype was a reconnaissance variant, designated Ye-155-R1, that made its first flight on 6 March 1964.<ref name=\"Bel p398\">Belyakov and Marmain 1994, p. 398.</ref> It had some characteristics that were unique to that prototype, and some of these were visually very evident: the wings had fixed wingtip tanks (600-litre capacity) to which small winglets were attached for stability purposes, but when it was found that fuel sloshing around in the tanks caused vibrations, they were eliminated. The aircraft also had attachments for movable foreplanes, [[Canard (aeronautics)|canards]], to help with pitch control at high speed (provisions for canards had previously been installed, but not used, on the [[Mikoyan-Gurevich Ye-152|Ye-152P]]).<ref name=\"WAPJ34 p108\">Lake 1998, p. 108.</ref><ref name=\"Bel p272-4\">Belyakov and Marmain 1994, pp. 272\u2013274.</ref>\n\nThe first flight of the interceptor prototype, Ye-155-P1, took place on 9 September 1964.<ref name=\"Bel p391\">Belyakov and Marmain 1994, p. 391.</ref> Development of the MiG-25, which represented a major step forward in Soviet [[aerodynamics]], [[Aerospace engineering|engineering]] and [[metallurgy]], took several more years to complete.<ref name=\"Bel p391\"/><ref name=\"Bel 387-8\">Belyakov and Marmain 1994, pp. 387\u2013388.</ref>\n\nOn 9 July 1967, the new aircraft was first shown to the public at the [[Soviet air shows|Domodedovo air show]], with four prototypes (three fighters and a reconnaissance aircraft) making a flypast.<ref name=\"WAPJ34 p109\">Lake 1998, p. 109.</ref>\n\n====Aviation records====\nThe Mikoyan-Gurevich design bureau soon realized that the performance of the new aircraft gave it great potential to set new flight records. In addition to their normal duties, the prototypes Ye-155-P1, Ye-155-R1, Ye-155-R3 were made lighter by removing some unneeded equipment and were used for these attempts. Under [[Federation Aeronautique Internationale]] (FAI) classification, the Ye-155 type belonged to class C1 (III), which specifies jet-powered land planes with unlimited maximum take-off weight. Records set included:\n* The first claim was for world speed records with no payload and payloads of 1,000 and 2,000 kilograms. MiG OKB Chief Test Pilot [[Aleksandr Vasilyevich Fedotov]] reached an average speed of 2,319.12&nbsp;km/h over a 1,000&nbsp;km circuit on 16 March 1965.<ref name=\"Bel p391\"/>\n* For pure speed, with no payload, test pilot Mikhail M. Komarov averaged 2,981.5&nbsp;km/h over a 500&nbsp;km closed circuit on 5 October 1967.<ref name=\"Bel p391\"/> On the same day, Fedotov reached an altitude of {{convert|29977|m|ft}} with a 1,000 kilogram payload.<ref name=\"Bel p392\"/> The MiG eventually became the first aircraft to go higher than {{convert|35000|m|ft}}.<ref name=\"Bel p392\"/>\n* Time to height records were recorded on 4 June 1973 when Boris A. Orlov climbed to 20,000&nbsp;m in 2&nbsp;min 49.8&nbsp;s. The same day, Pyotr M. Ostapenko reached 25,000&nbsp;m in 3&nbsp;min 12.6&nbsp;s and 30,000&nbsp;m in 4&nbsp;min 3.86&nbsp;s.<ref name=\"Bel p392\"/>\n* On 25 July 1973, Fedotov reached 35,230&nbsp;m with 1,000&nbsp;kg payload and 36,240&nbsp;m (118,900 feet) with no load (an absolute world record).<ref name=\"Bel p392\">Belyakov and Marmain 1994, p. 392.</ref> In the thin air, the engines flamed out, and the aircraft coasted in a ballistic trajectory by inertia alone. At the apex the speed had dropped to 75&nbsp;km/h.\n* On 31 August 1977, Ye-266M again flown by Fedotov, set the recognized absolute altitude record for a jet aircraft under its own power.<ref name=\"Bel p406-7\">Belyakov and Marmain 1994, pp. 406\u2013407.</ref> He reached {{convert|37650|m|ft}} at Podmoskovnoye, USSR in [[zoom climb]] (the absolute altitude record is different from the record for sustained altitude in horizontal flight). The aircraft was actually a MiG-25RB re-engined with the powerful R15BF2-300. It had earlier been part of the program to improve the aircraft's top speed that resulted in the MiG-25M prototype.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/>\n\nIn all, 29 records were claimed, of which seven were all-time world records for time to height, altitudes of 20,000&nbsp;m and higher, and speed. Several records still stand.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/>\n\n====Technical description====\nBecause of the [[Thermal expansion|thermal stresses]] incurred in flight above Mach 2, the Mikoyan-Gurevich OKB had difficulties choosing what materials to use for the aircraft. They had to use E-2 heat-resistant [[Plexiglas]] for the canopy and high-strength stainless steel for the wings and fuselage. Using titanium rather than steel would have been ideal, but it was expensive and difficult to work with. The problem of cracks in welded titanium structures with thin walls could not be solved, so the heavier [[nickel]] steel was used instead.  It cost far less than titanium and allowed for welding, along with heat-resistant seals.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">Gordon 2008</ref> The MiG-25 was constructed from 80% [[nickel-steel alloy]], 11% [[aluminium]], and 9% [[titanium]].<ref name=Eden_p308>Eden 2004, p. 308.</ref> The steel components were formed by a combination of [[spot welding]], automatic [[Welding|machine welding]], and hand [[arc welding]] methods.\n\nInitially, the interceptor version was equipped with the {{anchor|Smerch}}TL-25 ''Smerch-A'' (also referred to as ''Product 720'') [[radar]], a development of the system carried by the earlier [[Tu-128]]. While powerful and thus long-ranged and resistant to jamming, the system\u2014due to the age of its design and its intended purpose (tracking and targeting high- and fast-flying US bombers and reconnaissance aircraft)\u2014lacked [[look-down/shoot-down]] capability, which limited its effectiveness against low-flying targets. (This is one of the reasons why it was replaced with the [[Mikoyan-Gurevich MiG-31]], whose [[Zaslon]] radar has that capability.) By the time the MiG-25 entered service in 1969, this was a serious shortcoming, as strategic bombing doctrine was shifting towards low-level penetration of enemy territory. After Belenko's defection to Japan exposed this flaw to the West, a government decree issued on 4 November 1976 called for urgent development of a more advanced radar. This resulted in the [[pulse-Doppler radar]] ''Sapphire-25'' system fitted to the MiG-25PD variant.\n\nAs an interceptor, typical armament includes four supersonic (M>5) UR great range [[R-40 (missile)|R-40T (R-40TD)]] [[air-to-air missile]]s with thermal homing head and R-40P (R-40RD) with semi-active radar guidance system (maximum launch range, on altitudinal goal on a collision course \u2013 35\u201360&nbsp;km). A fuel tank can be suspended under the fuselage.  The aircraft could carry unguided gravity bombs in a rudimentary strike capability.{{citation needed|date=February 2020}} As the bombs would weigh no more and incur no more drag than its regular load of R-40 missiles, its performance was not impaired, leading to some impressive bombing feats; when released at an altitude of 20,000&nbsp;m (66,000&nbsp;ft) and a speed above Mach 2, a 500&nbsp;kg bomb would have a glide range of several tens of kilometres.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.soldiering.ru/avia/airplane/pvo_rus/mig25.php |title= |accessdate=14 November 2014}}</ref>\n\nThe MiG-25 was theoretically capable of a maximum speed of Mach 3+ and a ceiling of {{convert|27|km|ft|abbr=on}}.  Its high speed was problematic: although sufficient thrust was available to reach Mach 3.2, a limit of Mach 2.83 had to be imposed as the engines tended to overspeed and overheat at higher air speeds, possibly damaging them beyond repair.<ref>[http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,946651,00.html \"Intelligence: Big-Mouth Belenko.\"] ''Time,'' 11 October 1976.

The maximum speed of Mach 2.83 (3,000&nbsp;km/h) is allowed to maintain no more than 5 minutes due to the danger of overheating of the airframe and fuel in the tanks. When the airframe temperature reaches 290 C, the warning lamp lights up and the pilot must reduce airspeed. The use of a partial afterburner and a cruising flight altitude 19,000\u201321,000&nbsp;m makes it possible to have a range only 230&nbsp;km less than when flying Mach 0.9 at altitudes 9,000\u201310,000&nbsp;m. The maximum altitude of flight without an afterburner in operation is 12,000&nbsp;m.<ref>Practical aerodynamics of the MiG-25RB, Military Publishing House of the USSR Ministry of Defense, 1978, p. 88-90</ref> The poor fuel consumption in the subsonic regime, and hence range, is due to the engines having extremely low pressure ratio of just 4.75 at subsonic speeds. Specific Fuel Consumption (SFC) of the engines is 1.12 in cruise and 2.45 with afterburners.<ref>Soviet Spyplanes of the Cold War, Casemate, Yefim Gordon P.70</ref> For comparison purposes, this is 50% worse in cruise than the first generation of F-100 engines from the F-15 Eagle, but the SFC with afterburners is actually nearly equal despite the F-100 being a far newer engine design.<ref>http://www.jet-engine.net/miltfspec.html</ref>\n\n===Into production===\n[[File:MiG-25RB cams.jpg|thumb|Surveillance Cameras of the MiG-25RB]]\n\nFull-scale production of the ''MiG-25R'' ('Foxbat-B') began in 1969 at the Gorkii aircraft factory (Plant No.21). The ''MiG-25P'' (\"Foxbat-A\") followed in 1971, and 460 of this variant was built until production ended in 1982.  The improved PD variant that replaced it was built from 1978 till 1984 with 104 aircraft completed.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/> But from then on the Gorkii factory switched over production to the new [[MiG-31]].\n\n===Western intelligence and the MiG-25===\n[[File:Mig-25.jpg|thumb|MiG-25RBSh with markings of 2nd Sqn/47th GvORAP (Guards independent recce Regiment)]]\n\nInaccurate intelligence analysis caused the West initially to believe the MiG-25 was an agile air-combat fighter rather than an interceptor.

It was designed by the [[Soviet Union]]'s [[Mikoyan|Mikoyan-Gurevich]] bureau and is one of the few combat aircraft built primarily using [[stainless steel]]. It was the last plane designed by [[Mikhail Gurevich (aircraft designer)|Mikhail Gurevich]] before his retirement.<ref name=\"Flieger\">{{cite journal|author=L. Egenburg, A.

It has an operational top speed of [[Mach number|Mach]] 2.83 (Mach 3.2 is possible but at risk of significant damage to the engines) and features a powerful [[radar]] and four [[air-to-air missile]]s. When first seen in reconnaissance photography, the large wing suggested an enormous and highly maneuverable fighter, at a time when U.S. [[Energy\u2013maneuverability theory|design theories were also evolving towards higher maneuverability]] due to combat performance in the [[Vietnam War]]. The appearance of the MiG-25 sparked serious concern in the [[Western world|West]] and prompted dramatic increases in performance for the [[McDonnell Douglas F-15 Eagle]] then under development in the late 1960s. The capabilities of the MiG-25 were better understood in 1976 when Soviet pilot [[Viktor Belenko]] defected in a MiG-25 to the United States via [[Japan]]. It turned out that the aircraft's weight necessitated its large wings.\n\nProduction of the MiG-25 series ended in 1984 after completion of 1,186 aircraft.

In the decades after World War II, this meant not only dealing with accidental border violations, but more importantly defending the vast airspace of the USSR against US [[reconnaissance aircraft]] and [[strategic bomber]]s carrying free-fall nuclear bombs. The performance of these types of aircraft was steadily improved.  Overflights by the very high altitude American [[Lockheed U-2]] in the late 1950s revealed a need for higher altitude interceptor aircraft than currently available.<ref>Rich and Janos 1994, p. 15.</ref>\n\nThe subsonic [[Boeing B-47 Stratojet]] and [[Boeing B-52 Stratofortress]] strategic bombers were followed by the Mach&nbsp;2 [[Convair B-58 Hustler]], with the Mach&nbsp;3 [[North American XB-70 Valkyrie|North American B-70 Valkyrie]] on the drawing board at that time. A major upgrade in the PVO defence system was required,<ref>{{cite web|title=MiG-25 Foxbat was specifically designed to intercept the XB-70 Valkyrie|url=http://www.militaryfactory.com/aircraft/detail.asp?aircraft_id=64|website=militaryfactory dot com|publisher=Military Factory|accessdate=6 December 2016}}</ref> and, at the start of 1958, a requirement was issued for manned interceptors capable of reaching 3,000&nbsp;km/h (1,864&nbsp;mph) and heights of up to 27&nbsp;km (88,583&nbsp;ft). Mikoyan and Sukhoi responded.<ref>Gordon and Gunston 2000, p. 166.</ref>\n\n[[File:Mikoyan-Gurevich Ye-152 and Ye-152M top-view silhouette comparison.jpg|thumb|YE-152 and YE-152M experimental interceptor]]\nThe Mikoyan-Gurevich [[OKB]] had been working on a series of interceptors during the second half of the 1950s: the I-1, I-3U, I-7U, I-75, Ye-150, Ye-150A, [[Mikoyan-Gurevich Ye-152|Ye-152]], Ye-152A, Ye-152P, and Ye-152M. The Ye-150 was noteworthy because it was built specifically to test the [[Tumansky R-15]] engine, two of which would later be used for the MiG-25.  This led to Ye-152, alternatively known as Ye-166, which set several world records.<ref>Gordon and Gunston 2000, p. 106.</ref> The Ye-152M (converted from one of the two Ye-152 aircraft) was intended to be the definite heavy interceptor design. But before it was finished, the PVO had selected the [[Tupolev Tu-128]]. As the work on the MiG-25 was well under way, the single-engine Ye-152M was abandoned.\n\n===Designing a new interceptor===\nWork on the new Soviet interceptor that became the MiG-25 started in mid-1959,<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/> a year before Soviet intelligence learned of the American Mach 3 [[Lockheed A-12|A-12]] reconnaissance aircraft.<ref name=\"Great Book\">Spick 2000</ref> It is not clear if the design was influenced by the American [[North American A-5 Vigilante|A-5 Vigilante]].<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/>\n\nThe design bureau studied several possible layouts for the new aircraft. One had the engines located side by side, as on the [[MiG-19]]. The second had a stepped arrangement with one engine amidships, with exhaust under the fuselage, and another in the aft fuselage. The third project had an engine arrangement similar to that of the [[English Electric Lightning]], with two engines stacked vertically. Option two and three were both rejected because the size of the engines meant any of them would result in a very tall aircraft which would complicate maintenance.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/>\n\nThe idea of placing the engines in underwing nacelles was also rejected because of the dangers of any thrust asymmetry during flight. Having decided on engine configuration, there was thought of giving the machine [[variable-sweep wing]]s and a second crew member, a navigator. Variable geometry would improve maneuverability at subsonic speed, but at the cost of decreased fuel tank capacity. Because the reconnaissance aircraft would operate at high speed and high altitude, the idea was soon dropped. Another interesting but impractical idea was to improve the field performance using two RD36-35 lift-jets. Vertical takeoff and landing would allow for use of damaged runways during wartime and was studied on both sides of the [[Iron Curtain]]. The perennial problem with engines dedicated to vertical lift is they become mere dead weight in horizontal flight and also occupy space in the airframe needed for fuel. The MiG interceptor would need all the fuel it could get, so the idea was abandoned.<ref name=\"WAPJ34 p108\"/>\n\n[[File:Ye-155.png|thumb|left|Ye-155R3 Reconnaissance prototype with a 5,280-litre drop tank under the belly, 1964]]\nThe first prototype was a reconnaissance variant, designated Ye-155-R1, that made its first flight on 6 March 1964.<ref name=\"Bel p398\">Belyakov and Marmain 1994, p. 398.</ref> It had some characteristics that were unique to that prototype, and some of these were visually very evident: the wings had fixed wingtip tanks (600-litre capacity) to which small winglets were attached for stability purposes, but when it was found that fuel sloshing around in the tanks caused vibrations, they were eliminated. The aircraft also had attachments for movable foreplanes, [[Canard (aeronautics)|canards]], to help with pitch control at high speed (provisions for canards had previously been installed, but not used, on the [[Mikoyan-Gurevich Ye-152|Ye-152P]]).<ref name=\"WAPJ34 p108\">Lake 1998, p. 108.</ref><ref name=\"Bel p272-4\">Belyakov and Marmain 1994, pp. 272\u2013274.</ref>\n\nThe first flight of the interceptor prototype, Ye-155-P1, took place on 9 September 1964.<ref name=\"Bel p391\">Belyakov and Marmain 1994, p. 391.</ref> Development of the MiG-25, which represented a major step forward in Soviet [[aerodynamics]], [[Aerospace engineering|engineering]] and [[metallurgy]], took several more years to complete.<ref name=\"Bel p391\"/><ref name=\"Bel 387-8\">Belyakov and Marmain 1994, pp. 387\u2013388.</ref>\n\nOn 9 July 1967, the new aircraft was first shown to the public at the [[Soviet air shows|Domodedovo air show]], with four prototypes (three fighters and a reconnaissance aircraft) making a flypast.<ref name=\"WAPJ34 p109\">Lake 1998, p. 109.</ref>\n\n====Aviation records====\nThe Mikoyan-Gurevich design bureau soon realized that the performance of the new aircraft gave it great potential to set new flight records. In addition to their normal duties, the prototypes Ye-155-P1, Ye-155-R1, Ye-155-R3 were made lighter by removing some unneeded equipment and were used for these attempts. Under [[Federation Aeronautique Internationale]] (FAI) classification, the Ye-155 type belonged to class C1 (III), which specifies jet-powered land planes with unlimited maximum take-off weight. Records set included:\n* The first claim was for world speed records with no payload and payloads of 1,000 and 2,000 kilograms. MiG OKB Chief Test Pilot [[Aleksandr Vasilyevich Fedotov]] reached an average speed of 2,319.12&nbsp;km/h over a 1,000&nbsp;km circuit on 16 March 1965.<ref name=\"Bel p391\"/>\n* For pure speed, with no payload, test pilot Mikhail M. Komarov averaged 2,981.5&nbsp;km/h over a 500&nbsp;km closed circuit on 5 October 1967.<ref name=\"Bel p391\"/> On the same day, Fedotov reached an altitude of {{convert|29977|m|ft}} with a 1,000 kilogram payload.<ref name=\"Bel p392\"/> The MiG eventually became the first aircraft to go higher than {{convert|35000|m|ft}}.<ref name=\"Bel p392\"/>\n* Time to height records were recorded on 4 June 1973 when Boris A. Orlov climbed to 20,000&nbsp;m in 2&nbsp;min 49.8&nbsp;s. The same day, Pyotr M. Ostapenko reached 25,000&nbsp;m in 3&nbsp;min 12.6&nbsp;s and 30,000&nbsp;m in 4&nbsp;min 3.86&nbsp;s.<ref name=\"Bel p392\"/>\n* On 25 July 1973, Fedotov reached 35,230&nbsp;m with 1,000&nbsp;kg payload and 36,240&nbsp;m (118,900 feet) with no load (an absolute world record).<ref name=\"Bel p392\">Belyakov and Marmain 1994, p. 392.</ref> In the thin air, the engines flamed out, and the aircraft coasted in a ballistic trajectory by inertia alone. At the apex the speed had dropped to 75&nbsp;km/h.\n* On 31 August 1977, Ye-266M again flown by Fedotov, set the recognized absolute altitude record for a jet aircraft under its own power.<ref name=\"Bel p406-7\">Belyakov and Marmain 1994, pp. 406\u2013407.</ref> He reached {{convert|37650|m|ft}} at Podmoskovnoye, USSR in [[zoom climb]] (the absolute altitude record is different from the record for sustained altitude in horizontal flight). The aircraft was actually a MiG-25RB re-engined with the powerful R15BF2-300. It had earlier been part of the program to improve the aircraft's top speed that resulted in the MiG-25M prototype.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/>\n\nIn all, 29 records were claimed, of which seven were all-time world records for time to height, altitudes of 20,000&nbsp;m and higher, and speed. Several records still stand.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/>\n\n====Technical description====\nBecause of the [[Thermal expansion|thermal stresses]] incurred in flight above Mach 2, the Mikoyan-Gurevich OKB had difficulties choosing what materials to use for the aircraft. They had to use E-2 heat-resistant [[Plexiglas]] for the canopy and high-strength stainless steel for the wings and fuselage. Using titanium rather than steel would have been ideal, but it was expensive and difficult to work with. The problem of cracks in welded titanium structures with thin walls could not be solved, so the heavier [[nickel]] steel was used instead.  It cost far less than titanium and allowed for welding, along with heat-resistant seals.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">Gordon 2008</ref> The MiG-25 was constructed from 80% [[nickel-steel alloy]], 11% [[aluminium]], and 9% [[titanium]].<ref name=Eden_p308>Eden 2004, p. 308.</ref> The steel components were formed by a combination of [[spot welding]], automatic [[Welding|machine welding]], and hand [[arc welding]] methods.\n\nInitially, the interceptor version was equipped with the {{anchor|Smerch}}TL-25 ''Smerch-A'' (also referred to as ''Product 720'') [[radar]], a development of the system carried by the earlier [[Tu-128]]. While powerful and thus long-ranged and resistant to jamming, the system\u2014due to the age of its design and its intended purpose (tracking and targeting high- and fast-flying US bombers and reconnaissance aircraft)\u2014lacked [[look-down/shoot-down]] capability, which limited its effectiveness against low-flying targets. (This is one of the reasons why it was replaced with the [[Mikoyan-Gurevich MiG-31]], whose [[Zaslon]] radar has that capability.) By the time the MiG-25 entered service in 1969, this was a serious shortcoming, as strategic bombing doctrine was shifting towards low-level penetration of enemy territory. After Belenko's defection to Japan exposed this flaw to the West, a government decree issued on 4 November 1976 called for urgent development of a more advanced radar. This resulted in the [[pulse-Doppler radar]] ''Sapphire-25'' system fitted to the MiG-25PD variant.\n\nAs an interceptor, typical armament includes four supersonic (M>5) UR great range [[R-40 (missile)|R-40T (R-40TD)]] [[air-to-air missile]]s with thermal homing head and R-40P (R-40RD) with semi-active radar guidance system (maximum launch range, on altitudinal goal on a collision course \u2013 35\u201360&nbsp;km). A fuel tank can be suspended under the fuselage.  The aircraft could carry unguided gravity bombs in a rudimentary strike capability.{{citation needed|date=February 2020}} As the bombs would weigh no more and incur no more drag than its regular load of R-40 missiles, its performance was not impaired, leading to some impressive bombing feats; when released at an altitude of 20,000&nbsp;m (66,000&nbsp;ft) and a speed above Mach 2, a 500&nbsp;kg bomb would have a glide range of several tens of kilometres.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.soldiering.ru/avia/airplane/pvo_rus/mig25.php |title= |accessdate=14 November 2014}}</ref>\n\nThe MiG-25 was theoretically capable of a maximum speed of Mach 3+ and a ceiling of {{convert|27|km|ft|abbr=on}}.  Its high speed was problematic: although sufficient thrust was available to reach Mach 3.2, a limit of Mach 2.83 had to be imposed as the engines tended to overspeed and overheat at higher air speeds, possibly damaging them beyond repair.<ref>[http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,946651,00.html \"Intelligence: Big-Mouth Belenko.\"] ''Time,'' 11 October 1976.

The maximum speed of Mach 2.83 (3,000&nbsp;km/h) is allowed to maintain no more than 5 minutes due to the danger of overheating of the airframe and fuel in the tanks. When the airframe temperature reaches 290 C, the warning lamp lights up and the pilot must reduce airspeed. The use of a partial afterburner and a cruising flight altitude 19,000\u201321,000&nbsp;m makes it possible to have a range only 230&nbsp;km less than when flying Mach 0.9 at altitudes 9,000\u201310,000&nbsp;m. The maximum altitude of flight without an afterburner in operation is 12,000&nbsp;m.<ref>Practical aerodynamics of the MiG-25RB, Military Publishing House of the USSR Ministry of Defense, 1978, p. 88-90</ref> The poor fuel consumption in the subsonic regime, and hence range, is due to the engines having extremely low pressure ratio of just 4.75 at subsonic speeds. Specific Fuel Consumption (SFC) of the engines is 1.12 in cruise and 2.45 with afterburners.<ref>Soviet Spyplanes of the Cold War, Casemate, Yefim Gordon P.70</ref> For comparison purposes, this is 50% worse in cruise than the first generation of F-100 engines from the F-15 Eagle, but the SFC with afterburners is actually nearly equal despite the F-100 being a far newer engine design.<ref>http://www.jet-engine.net/miltfspec.html</ref>\n\n===Into production===\n[[File:MiG-25RB cams.jpg|thumb|Surveillance Cameras of the MiG-25RB]]\n\nFull-scale production of the ''MiG-25R'' ('Foxbat-B') began in 1969 at the Gorkii aircraft factory (Plant No.21). The ''MiG-25P'' (\"Foxbat-A\") followed in 1971, and 460 of this variant was built until production ended in 1982.  The improved PD variant that replaced it was built from 1978 till 1984 with 104 aircraft completed.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/> But from then on the Gorkii factory switched over production to the new [[MiG-31]].\n\n===Western intelligence and the MiG-25===\n[[File:Mig-25.jpg|thumb|MiG-25RBSh with markings of 2nd Sqn/47th GvORAP (Guards independent recce Regiment)]]\n\nInaccurate intelligence analysis caused the West initially to believe the MiG-25 was an agile air-combat fighter rather than an interceptor.

The aircraft had been buried to prevent its destruction on the ground by coalition aircraft. When uncovered, the MiG-25RB was incomplete, as the wings could not be located.

North-east of the town lies the [[Augsburg Western Woods Nature Park]].\n\nBesides the town of Kirchheim, the municipality encompasses the villages of Derndorf, Hasberg, Sp\u00f6ck und Tiefenried. The town has a [[Municipal association (Germany)|municipal association]] with [[Eppishausen]] of which it is the capital and place of administration.\n\nThe town lies {{convert|38|km|mi}} south-west of [[Augsburg]], {{convert|80|km|mi}} west of [[Munich]].\n\n==History==\n\n===Early history===\nKirchheim's History already begins 8000 BC in the [[stone age]] with the first traces of hunter-gatherers. In the [[bronze age]] around 1800 BC the first larger settlement was founded with around 15 homesteads. After the [[Ancient Rome|Romans]] the [[Alemanni]] were settling in the town and were establishing the name Kirchheim (German \"Heim bei der Kirche\", English \"home at the church\").\n\n===Middle Ages and Renaissance===\nIn the [[Middle Ages]] the dominion of Kirchheim first was a [[crown land]] of the king. The first mention in a document was 1067. Between the 8th and 10th century it was given away to the bishops auf [[Augsburg]]. The bishops gave it as a [[fief]] to different aristocratic families. 1343 [[Holy Roman Emperor]] [[Louis IV, Holy Roman Emperor|Louis IV]] gave Kirchheim [[high justice]]. Kirchheim was burned to the ground in July 1372 because of a dispute between its feudal lord and the city of [[Augsburg]] over custom laws on the [[Lech (river)|lech river]]. Also in the [[War of the cities 1387\u20131389]] the town had to take heavy damages. Kirchheim was vested with market rights 1490 by [[Holy Roman Emperor]] [[Frederick III, Holy Roman Emperor|Frederick III]] which stimulated economic growth. In the [[German Peasants' War]] the town and castle was sacked on 7. May 1525. Knight [[Hans Walther von H\u00fcrnheim]] was awarded for his merits for Kaiser and empire 1544 with coat of arms and seal for Kirchheim by [[Holy Roman Emperor]] [[Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor|Charles V]] himself.\n\nThe dominion of Kirchheim was 1551 sold to [[Anton Fugger]]. [[Hans Fugger]] from 1578 to 1585 erected a glorious [[:de:Fuggerschloss Kirchheim/Schwaben|renaissance castle]] instead of the medieval castle complex. The castle was created after the model of the Spanish [[El Escorial]] near [[Madrid]] with integrated church. 1601 a friary of the [[Dominican Order]] is established. An own [[guild]] system is founded 1626. When trying to drain the swampy [[Mindel]] valley in 1581, the largest plow in the world, pulled by 102 horses, was used. One of the huge plowshares is preserved in the castle.\n\n===Modern Europe===\nIn the [[Thirty Years' War]] [[Swabia]] was occupied by the Swedes in 1632. In the beginning Kirchheim could escape depredations by paying danegeld by the Fugger. Swedish chancellor [[Axel Oxenstierna]] gave Kirchheim 1633 as a war loot to the Swedish employed general [[Hohenlohe-Langenburg]]. The town was sacked and the population was tortured and murdered. The neighbouring Eppishausen was totally burned down. The Swedish withdrew after the total looting in 1635. In 1646 the place was again a theatre of the war between Swedish, Bavarian, imperial and French troops. All of them pressed the people to pay protection money and war costs.\n\nAfter some of the peasants refused to swear the oath of allegiance to count Joseph Hugo Fugger and after it was tried to be enforced, it came 1785 to the ''peasant shooting'': Three peasants where shot and six deadly wounded.\n\nAs a result of the [[Napoleonic Wars]], Kirchheim fell in 1806 to the [[Kingdom of Bavaria]]. On 20 June 1861 nearly the whole town burned down in a great fire. Only three days later a hail storm destroyed most of the harvest. The town was newly structured and rebuilt in the years after.\n\n===20th and 21st centuries===\nIn [[World War II]] the town was occupied on 27 April 1945 by US tank units of the [[Seventh United States Army|7th US Army]]. Because of the war, the town had 83 dead and missing citizens.\n\nCount [[Joseph-Ernst Graf Fugger von Gl\u00f6tt]] was a supporter of the [[20 July plot]] to assassinate [[Hitler]] and later a politician and founder of the [[Christian Social Union of Bavaria]], for which he was a representative in the German [[Bundestag]] and the [[Landtag of Bavaria]]. He established regular meetings of the bavarian delegates of the [[Bundestag]] of his party in Kirchheim. The there proclaimed Kirchheimer resolutions were determining for German and bavarian politics.\n\nToday the famous cedar hall, with the most beautiful carved ceiling of the renaissance north of the alps and amazing acoustics, in the castle of Kirchheim is often open and used for cultural events.\n\n=== Population development ===\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+\n! colspan=\"21\" align=\"left\" style=\"background:#efefef;\" | population of the market town Kirchheim in Swabia 1840-2012\n|-\n| '''year''' || 1840||     1871      ||1900||     1925      ||     1939      ||     1950      ||     1961      ||     1970      ||     1987      ||     2002      ||     2003      ||     2004      ||     2005      ||     2006      ||     2007      ||     2008      ||     2009      ||     2010      ||2011||     2012     \n|-\n| '''residents''' ||      1.834      ||     1.802      ||1.939||2.256||     2.149      ||     3.274      ||     2.425      ||     2.376      ||     2.403      ||     2.571      ||     2.567      ||     2.544      ||     2.517      ||     2.505||     2.480      ||     2.483      ||     2.489      ||2.444||     2.548||           2.545     \n|}\n\n==Culture and places of interest==\nKirchheim has a rich cultural heritage. Most famous is the large fugger castle, built after the model of the Spanish [[El Escorial]] near [[Madrid]] with the attached castle and parish church St. Peter and Paul. In it the prominent painting [[Assumption of Mary]] of [[Peter Paul Rubens]] is located on the southern side altar. Other paintings are of [[Domenichino]] und Padovini. Inside the church is the table tomb of [[Hans Fugger]] made by [[Hubert Gerhard]] and [[Alexander Colyn]], which is regarded to be an outstanding artwork of sculpture of the renaissance in south Germany. The cedar hall inside the castle has the most beautiful carved ceiling of the Renaissance north of the alps and is said to have the best acoustics in Europe. Other places of interest include the museum of local history inside the historic town hall and the statue of St. Nepomuk on the market square.\n\n==Economy and infrastructure==\n\n=== Local companies ===\n* Wanzl Metallwarenfabrik: metal works factory and the world's largest producer of shopping carts\n* Franz Wolf GmbH: internationally active producer of precision parts with die casting\n* Max Holzheu Bauunternehmen GmbH and Holzheu Holzbau GmbH: over-regional construction and wood construction companies\n* Fa.

Germany|municipality]] and a [[market town]] in the district of [[Unterallg\u00e4u]] in the region of [[Swabia]] (Schwaben) in the south-west of [[Bavaria]], [[Germany]].\nThe town was greatly influenced by the [[Fugger]] family. North-east of the town lies the [[Augsburg Western Woods Nature Park]].\n\nBesides the town of Kirchheim, the municipality encompasses the villages of Derndorf, Hasberg, Sp\u00f6ck und Tiefenried. The town has a [[Municipal association (Germany)|municipal association]] with [[Eppishausen]] of which it is the capital and place of administration.\n\nThe town lies {{convert|38|km|mi}} south-west of [[Augsburg]], {{convert|80|km|mi}} west of [[Munich]].\n\n==History==\n\n===Early history===\nKirchheim's History already begins 8000 BC in the [[stone age]] with the first traces of hunter-gatherers. In the [[bronze age]] around 1800 BC the first larger settlement was founded with around 15 homesteads. After the [[Ancient Rome|Romans]] the [[Alemanni]] were settling in the town and were establishing the name Kirchheim (German \"Heim bei der Kirche\", English \"home at the church\").\n\n===Middle Ages and Renaissance===\nIn the [[Middle Ages]] the dominion of Kirchheim first was a [[crown land]] of the king. The first mention in a document was 1067. Between the 8th and 10th century it was given away to the bishops auf [[Augsburg]]. The bishops gave it as a [[fief]] to different aristocratic families. 1343 [[Holy Roman Emperor]] [[Louis IV, Holy Roman Emperor|Louis IV]] gave Kirchheim [[high justice]]. Kirchheim was burned to the ground in July 1372 because of a dispute between its feudal lord and the city of [[Augsburg]] over custom laws on the [[Lech (river)|lech river]]. Also in the [[War of the cities 1387\u20131389]] the town had to take heavy damages. Kirchheim was vested with market rights 1490 by [[Holy Roman Emperor]] [[Frederick III, Holy Roman Emperor|Frederick III]] which stimulated economic growth. In the [[German Peasants' War]] the town and castle was sacked on 7. May 1525. Knight [[Hans Walther von H\u00fcrnheim]] was awarded for his merits for Kaiser and empire 1544 with coat of arms and seal for Kirchheim by [[Holy Roman Emperor]] [[Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor|Charles V]] himself.\n\nThe dominion of Kirchheim was 1551 sold to [[Anton Fugger]]. [[Hans Fugger]] from 1578 to 1585 erected a glorious [[:de:Fuggerschloss Kirchheim/Schwaben|renaissance castle]] instead of the medieval castle complex. The castle was created after the model of the Spanish [[El Escorial]] near [[Madrid]] with integrated church. 1601 a friary of the [[Dominican Order]] is established. An own [[guild]] system is founded 1626. When trying to drain the swampy [[Mindel]] valley in 1581, the largest plow in the world, pulled by 102 horses, was used. One of the huge plowshares is preserved in the castle.\n\n===Modern Europe===\nIn the [[Thirty Years' War]] [[Swabia]] was occupied by the Swedes in 1632. In the beginning Kirchheim could escape depredations by paying danegeld by the Fugger. Swedish chancellor [[Axel Oxenstierna]] gave Kirchheim 1633 as a war loot to the Swedish employed general [[Hohenlohe-Langenburg]]. The town was sacked and the population was tortured and murdered. The neighbouring Eppishausen was totally burned down. The Swedish withdrew after the total looting in 1635. In 1646 the place was again a theatre of the war between Swedish, Bavarian, imperial and French troops. All of them pressed the people to pay protection money and war costs.\n\nAfter some of the peasants refused to swear the oath of allegiance to count Joseph Hugo Fugger and after it was tried to be enforced, it came 1785 to the ''peasant shooting'': Three peasants where shot and six deadly wounded.\n\nAs a result of the [[Napoleonic Wars]], Kirchheim fell in 1806 to the [[Kingdom of Bavaria]]. On 20 June 1861 nearly the whole town burned down in a great fire. Only three days later a hail storm destroyed most of the harvest. The town was newly structured and rebuilt in the years after.\n\n===20th and 21st centuries===\nIn [[World War II]] the town was occupied on 27 April 1945 by US tank units of the [[Seventh United States Army|7th US Army]]. Because of the war, the town had 83 dead and missing citizens.\n\nCount [[Joseph-Ernst Graf Fugger von Gl\u00f6tt]] was a supporter of the [[20 July plot]] to assassinate [[Hitler]] and later a politician and founder of the [[Christian Social Union of Bavaria]], for which he was a representative in the German [[Bundestag]] and the [[Landtag of Bavaria]]. He established regular meetings of the bavarian delegates of the [[Bundestag]] of his party in Kirchheim. The there proclaimed Kirchheimer resolutions were determining for German and bavarian politics.\n\nToday the famous cedar hall, with the most beautiful carved ceiling of the renaissance north of the alps and amazing acoustics, in the castle of Kirchheim is often open and used for cultural events.\n\n=== Population development ===\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+\n! colspan=\"21\" align=\"left\" style=\"background:#efefef;\" | population of the market town Kirchheim in Swabia 1840-2012\n|-\n| '''year''' || 1840||     1871      ||1900||     1925      ||     1939      ||     1950      ||     1961      ||     1970      ||     1987      ||     2002      ||     2003      ||     2004      ||     2005      ||     2006      ||     2007      ||     2008      ||     2009      ||     2010      ||2011||     2012     \n|-\n| '''residents''' ||      1.834      ||     1.802      ||1.939||2.256||     2.149      ||     3.274      ||     2.425      ||     2.376      ||     2.403      ||     2.571      ||     2.567      ||     2.544      ||     2.517      ||     2.505||     2.480      ||     2.483      ||     2.489      ||2.444||     2.548||           2.545     \n|}\n\n==Culture and places of interest==\nKirchheim has a rich cultural heritage. Most famous is the large fugger castle, built after the model of the Spanish [[El Escorial]] near [[Madrid]] with the attached castle and parish church St. Peter and Paul. In it the prominent painting [[Assumption of Mary]] of [[Peter Paul Rubens]] is located on the southern side altar. Other paintings are of [[Domenichino]] und Padovini. Inside the church is the table tomb of [[Hans Fugger]] made by [[Hubert Gerhard]] and [[Alexander Colyn]], which is regarded to be an outstanding artwork of sculpture of the renaissance in south Germany. The cedar hall inside the castle has the most beautiful carved ceiling of the Renaissance north of the alps and is said to have the best acoustics in Europe. Other places of interest include the museum of local history inside the historic town hall and the statue of St. Nepomuk on the market square.\n\n==Economy and infrastructure==\n\n=== Local companies ===\n* Wanzl Metallwarenfabrik: metal works factory and the world's largest producer of shopping carts\n* Franz Wolf GmbH: internationally active producer of precision parts with die casting\n* Max Holzheu Bauunternehmen GmbH and Holzheu Holzbau GmbH: over-regional construction and wood construction companies\n* Fa.

{"title_page": "Bond tester", "text_new": "A '''bond tester''' is a [[scientific instrument]] used to measure the [[mechanical strength]] of bonds, evaluate bond strength distributions or determine compliance with specified bond strength requirements of the applicable acquisition document.<ref>https://www.ipc.org/TM/2.4.42.3.pdf</ref> Typically a load is applied to a bond by a hook or shear tool, whereafter a force measurement is taken and the failure mode of the tested sample is recorded. More often than not bond tests are destructive and samples are scrapped after testing. In aerospace and medical applications, non destructive testing is common, whereby the bond is loaded up to a point to reveal nonacceptable bonds while avoiding damage to acceptable bonds.\n\nElectrical and thermal bonds are such an integral part of electronic and [[semiconductor]] construction that they may often be taken for granted.
