Point blank period. It actually makes no sense to even include a \u201c''no copyright infringement intended''\u201d disclaimer. By adding that disclaimer, you are saying,<blockquote>\u201cHey, I know I don\u2019t have your permission to use your stuff, but I\u2019m going to use it anyways. But just remember, I didn\u2019t intend to use it and steal it without permission though.\u201d</blockquote>\u2026..an outright confession to stealing right? The disclaimer implies that you are fully aware of using someone\u2019s intellectual property without permission.\n\n= Why is the disclaimer so commonly used? =\n''\u00b7 Many people use the disclaimer without really understanding what it means''\n\n''\u00b7 People intend to use it as a notice to state they are not the copyright owner''\n\n''\u00b7 People want immediate access to use something & therefore, do not get permission for use; instead, they use the disclaimer as a replacement to \u201cjustify\u201d the use''\n\nFor a variety of those reasons, many people become guilty of infringement. However, although intentions of using the disclaimer might be innocent, that does not justify the act of infringement.\n\nKeep in mind that anything you say, use, or write on the internet can & will be used against you. Legally, using that disclaimer can possibly be used against you if someone sues you for infringement. So, just avoid using it completely.\n\n= How can I get permission to use someone else\u2019s property? =\nIn order to use intellectual property that is not yours, do the following:<blockquote>\u00b7 Find out the copyright owner. Some owners use third party companies to facilitate leasing opportunities\n\n\u00b7 Request use of the intellectual property you want to use from the copyright owner (or the third party where applicable)\n\n\u00b7 Once your request for use is approved, you can use the intellectual property according to the terms/conditions agreed with the copyright owner</blockquote>Using the phrase \u201cNo copyright infringement intended\u201d is literally providing evidence to the whole world that you ''are'' using someone else\u2019s property without permission.

[[Delhi Town Hall]] was built in 1863 by the British.\n\n===Original three bazaars===\nThe term Chandni Chowk originally referred only to the square that had a reflecting pool. Now the whole straight road which runs through the middle of the walled city, from the [[Lahori Gate (Red Fort)|Lahori Gate of the Red Fort]] to [[Fatehpuri Masjid]] is called Chandani Chowk. The road was then divided into three following [[bazaar]]s:<ref>Encyclopaedic Survey of Islamic Culture: Growth & Development, Mohamed Taher, Anmol Publications, 1998.</ref><ref name=moonlit1/>\n\n* '''[[Urdu Bazaar (Delhi)|Urdu Bazar]]''': Lahori Gate of the Mughal royal palace to Chowk Kotwali near [[Gurudwara Sis Ganj Sahib]] was called Urdu Bazaar, i.e., the encampment market. The [[Urdu]] language received its name from this encampment. [[Ghalib]] noted the destruction of this market during the disturbances of the [[Indian Rebellion of 1857]] and its aftermath.\n\n* '''[[Johri Bazar]]''': Chowk Kotwali to Chandni Chowk (location of now demolished [[Ghantaghar]], presently in front of Municipal/Town Hall) section of the straight road was originally called Johri Bazar.\n\n* '''Fatehpuri Bazar''': 'Chandni Chowk' to [[Fatehpuri Masjid]] section of the straight road was originally called the Fatehpuri Bazar.\n\nNow choked with congestion, the market retains its historical character.<ref name=orig1/>\n\n=== Kucha, katra and havelis ===\n[[File:1857 bank of delhi2.jpg|right|thumb|[[Begum Samru]]'s Palace at Chandni Chowk, Delhi, 1857, after [[Indian Rebellion of 1857]]]]\n[[File:Chandni Chowk, Delhi, 1858.jpg|thumb|A ''[[haveli]]'' on Chandni Chowk in 1858 (picture by [[Felice Beato]])]]\nThe road now called Chandni Chowk had several streets running off it which were called ''kuchas'' (streets/wings).

Shahjahanabad Redevelopment Corporation [29], under the auspices of the Government of the NCT of Delhi, is the agency carrying out this task. The redevelopment plan includes footpaths to make the area more pedestrian-friendly for a large number of shoppers and visitors. No motorized traffic will be allowed on Chandni Chowk from Red Fort to Fatehpuri Masjid. Roads are also planned to be decongested and some will be barricaded. People who want to come there will have to use the Ebus. The redevelopment plan was supposed to have been completed before the 2010 Commonwealth Games but has been delayed for various reasons. Delhi government is now pushing it seriously. The redevelopment plan is being implemented under Deputy Chief Minister Manish Sisodia. The Plan also includes extra parking for 1500 cars.

No motorized traffic will be allowed on Chandni Chowk from Red Fort to Fatehpuri Masjid. Roads are also planned to be decongested and some will be barricaded. People who want to come there will have to use the Ebus. The redevelopment plan was supposed to have been completed before the 2010 Commonwealth Games but has been delayed for various reasons.

Sometimes known by the [[Latinisation of names|Latinized]] form of his name, '''Hylacomylus'''. His work was influential among contemporary cartographers. He and his collaborator, [[Matthias Ringmann]], are credited with the first recorded usage of the word ''[[Americas|America]]'' to name a portion of the [[New World]] in honour of the Italian explorer [[Amerigo Vespucci]]. Waldseem\u00fcller was also the first to map South America as a continent separate from Asia; the first to produce a printed globe and the first to create a printed wall map of Europe. A set of his maps printed as an appendix to the 1513 edition of Ptolemy's ''Geography'' is considered to be the first example of a modern atlas.\n\n==Life and works==\nDetails of Waldseem\u00fcller's life are scarce. He was born around 1470 in the German town of [[Wolfenweiler]]. His father was a butcher and moved to [[Freiburg im Breisgau]] in about 1480. Records show that Waldseem\u00fcller was enrolled in 1490 at the [[University of Freiburg]] where [[Gregor Reisch]], a noted humanist scholar, was one of his influential teachers.<ref>Lester p. 343</ref><ref>Meurer p. 1204</ref> After finishing at the university, he lived in [[Basel]] where he was ordained a priest and, apparently, gained experience in printing and engraving while working with the printer community in Basel.<ref>Lester p. 343</ref><ref>Fern\u00e1ndez-Armesto p. 182</ref>\n\nAround 1500, an association of humanist scholars formed in [[Saint-Di\u00e9-des-Vosges |Saint-Di\u00e9]] under the patronage of [[Ren\u00e9 II, Duke of Lorraine]]. They called themselves the ''Gymnasium Vosagense'' and their leader was Walter Lud. Their initial intention was to publish a new edition of Ptolemy's ''Geography''. Waldseem\u00fcller was invited to join the group and contribute his skills as a cartographer. It is not clear how he came to the groups's attention, but Lud later described him as a master cartographer. [[Matthias Ringmann]] was also brought into the group because of his previous work with the ''Geography'' and his knowledge of Greek and Latin. Ringmann and Waldseem\u00fcller soon became friends and collaborators.<ref>Lester pp. 343-344</ref><ref>Baldi p. 101</ref>\n\n===1507 world map===\nIn 1506, the ''Gymnasium'' obtained a French translation of the Soderini Letter, a booklet attributed to [[Amerigo Vespucci]] that provided a sensational account of four alleged Vespucci voyages to explore the coast of lands recently discovered in the western Atlantic. The ''Gymnasium'' surmised that this was the \"new world\" or the \"antipodes\" hypothesized by classical writers. The Soderini Letter gave Vespucci credit for discovery of this new continent and implied that newly obtained Portuguese maps were based on his explorations. They decided to put aside the ''Geography'' for the moment and publish a brief ''[[Cosmographiae Introductio |Introduction to Cosmography]]'' with an accompanying world map. The ''Introduction'' was written by Ringmann and included a Latin translation of the ''Soderini Letter''. In a preface to the ''Letter'', Ringmann wrote \n<blockquote>\"I see no reason why anyone could properly disapprove of a name derived from that of Amerigo, the discoverer, a man of sagacious genius. A suitable form would be Amerige, meaning Land of Amerigo, or America, since Europe and Asia have received women's names.\"<ref>Fernandez-Armesto p. 185</ref></blockquote> \n\n[[File:Waldseemuller map 2.jpg|thumb|upright=1.65|''Universalis Cosmographia'', Waldseem\u00fcller's 1507 world map which was the first to show the Americas separate from Asia]]\n\nWhile Ringmann was writing the ''Introduction'', Waldseem\u00fcller focused on the creation of a world map using an aggregation of sources including maps based on the works of Ptolemy, [[Henricus Martellus]], [[Alberto Cantino]] and [[Caverio map|Nicol\u00f2 de Caverio]]. In addition to a large 12-panel wall map, Waldseem\u00fcller created a smaller, simplified globe. The wall map was decorated with prominent portraits of Ptolemy and Vespucci. The map and globe were notable for showing the New World as a continent separate from Asia and for naming the southern landmass America. By April 1507, the map, globe and accompanying book, ''Introduction to Cosmography'', were published. A thousand copies were printed and sold throughout Europe.<ref>Meurer pp. 1204-1206</ref>\n\nThe ''Introduction'' and map were a great success and four editions were printed in the first year alone. The map was widely used in universities and was influential among cartographers who admired the craftsmanship that went into its creation. In the following years other maps were printed that often incorporated the name America. Although Waldseem\u00fcller had intended the name to apply only to a specific part of Brazil, other maps applied it to the entire continent. In 1538, [[Gerardus Mercator]] used America to name both the North and South continents on his influential map and by this point the name was securely fixed on the New World<ref>Fernandez-Armesto pp. 185-186</ref>\n\n===Ptolemy's ''Geography'' (1513)===\nAfter 1507, Waldseem\u00fcller and Ringmann continued to collaborate on a new edition of Ptolemy's ''Geography''. In 1508 Ringmann traveled to Italy and obtained a Greek manuscript of ''Geography'' (''Codex Vaticanum Graecorum 191''). With this key reference they continued to make progress and Waldseem\u00fcller was able to finish his maps. However, completion was forestalled when their patron, Duke Ren\u00e9 II, died in 1508. The new edition was finally printed in 1513 by Johannes Schott in Strasbourg. By then, Waldseem\u00fcller had pulled out of the project and was not credited for his cartographic work.<ref>Lester p. 379</ref><ref>Meurer p. 1206</ref> Nevertheless his maps were recognized as important contributions to the science of cartography and was considered a standard reference work for many decades.<ref>Wolff p. 117</ref>\n\nApproximately twenty of Waldseem\u00fcller's ''tabulae modernae'' (modern maps) were included in the new ''Geography'' as a separate appendix, ''Claudii Ptolemaei Supplementem''.

The New World was no longer clearly shown as a continent separate from Asia and the name America had been replaced with ''Terra Incognita'' (Unknown Land).

In 1508 he contributed a treatise on surveying and perspective to the fourth edition of [[Gregor Reisch |Gregor Reisch\u2019s]] ''Margarita Philosophica''. He included an illustration of a  forerunner to the [[theodolite]], a surveying instrument he called the polimetrum.

Paarl is unusual among South African place-names, in being pronounced differently in English than in Afrikaans;  likewise unusual about the town's name is Afrikaners customary attachment to it, saying not  ''in Paarl'',  but rather ''in die Paarl'', or ''in die P\u00earel'' (literally, \"in the Paarl\").\n\nPaarl gained international attention when, on 11 February 1990, [[Nelson Mandela]] walked, with live international Television coverage, out of Victor Verster Correctional Centre (now known as [[Drakenstein Correctional Centre]]) in Paarl ending his 27 years of imprisonment, and beginning a course to South Africa's [[History of South Africa (1994\u2013present)|post-apartheid era]] and, notably, to multi-racial elections.<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/onthisday/hi/dates/stories/february/11/newsid_2539000/2539947.stm BBC on this Day 11 Feb 1990: Freedom of Nelson Mandela]</ref> Mandela spent three years in prison here living in a private house within the walls.  Today, a bronze statue of Mandela stands outside the prison.\n\nPaarl hosted a match from the [[ICC Cricket World Cup 2003]].  The headquarters of [[Ceres Fruit Juices]] is located in the city, although its namesake and source of much of the fruit, [[Ceres, Western Cape|Ceres]] Valley, lies around one hour's drive to the northeast.\n\nThe district is particularly well known for its Pearl Mountain or \"Paarl Rock\". This huge [[granite]] rock is formed by three rounded outcrops and has been compared in majesty to [[Uluru]] (formerly known as Ayers Rock) in Australia. (However, they are not geologically similar. Paarl Rock consists of intrusive igneous rock, while Uluru is a sedimentary remnant)\n\n== History ==\nThe area that is now known as Paarl was first and is still inhabited by the [[Khoekhoe]].  The Peninsular Khoikhoi people and the Cochoqua people live in this area divided by the Berg River Valley.  The Cochaqua were cattle-herding people and among the richest of the Khoi tribes.  They had between 16,000-18,000 members and originally called Paarl Mountain, Tortoise Mountain.<ref name=\"paarlonline.com\">{{cite web |url=http://www.paarlonline.com/history.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-03-26 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110612112632/http://paarlonline.com/history.html |archivedate=12 June 2011 |df=dmy-all }}</ref>\n\nThe [[Dutch East India Company]], under the leadership of [[Jan van Riebeeck]], established meat-trading relationships with the Khoikhoi people on the [[Table Bay]] coastline.  In 1657, in search of new trading relationships inland, Abraham Gabemma saw a giant granite rock glistening in the sun after a rainstorm and named it \"de Diamondt en de Peerlberg\" (Diamond and Pearl Mountain), from which Paarl is derived.<ref name=raper/><ref name=\"Schirmer1980\">''The concise illustrated South African Encyclopaedia.''

First edition, about 211pp</ref> Gabemma (often also spelt Gabbema) was the Fiscal (public treasurer) for the settlement on the shores of Table Bay. The \"diamonds\" disappeared from the name, and it became known simply as Pearl Rock or Pearl Mountain.\n\nIn 1687, Governor [[Simon van der Stel]] gave the title to the first colonial farms in the area to \"free burghers\". The following year, the French [[Huguenots]] arrived in the [[Western Cape]] and began to settle on farms in the area.<ref name=\"paarlonline.com\"/>  The fertile soil and the [[Mediterranean]]-like climate of this region provided perfect conditions for farming. The settlers planted [[orchards]], [[vegetable]] [[gardens]] and, above all, [[vineyards]].<ref name=\"Pinkerton\">[https://books.google.com/books?id=xiEnAAAAMAAJ&pg=PA10&as_brr=1&ei=Sc6IR8WKNYXc6wLt75mVBg A General Collection of the Best and Most Interesting Voyages and Travels in All Parts of the World, Vol XVI.] John Pinkerton, 1814. London: Longman, Hurst, Rees, and Orme.</ref> Thus began Paarl's long and continuing history as a major wine- and fruit-producing area of South Africa.\n\nIn 1875 a congregation was formed out of a desire to be educated in their mother tongue. This was the result of a Reverend GWA van der Lingen idea who tried to motivate and convince people of his principles. The congregation would raise funds and begin construction of a church that would later be known as the \"Toring Kerk\" (Tower Church). Construction finished in 1905. The church contains materials imported from London and Egypt.<ref>NG Toringkerk pamphlet handed out by the church itself </ref>\n\nThe arrival of the European settlers brought on a conflict with the [[Khoikhoi]] people, as land and water resources began to be contested and the [[Khoi]] traditions of communal land use came in conflict with the settler's concept of private property.  The Khoi peoples were defeated in local war and were further decimated by European diseases. The population scattered inland toward the [[Orange River]] or became labourers on settler farms.<ref name=\"paarlonline.com\"/>\n\n==Demographics==\nIn the [[South African National Census of 2001|2001 census]] Paarl's population was recorded as being 82,713 people in 20,138 households, in a land area of {{convert|32.2|km2}}. 67.8% of the inhabitants described themselves as \"[[Coloured]]\", 21.2% as \"[[White South African|White]]\", 10.5% as \"[[Black African]]\", and 0.5% as \"[[Indian South African|Indian]] or [[Asian South African|Asian]]\". 85.5% spoke [[Afrikaans language|Afrikaans]] as their [[first language]], 8.5% spoke [[Xhosa language|Xhosa]], and 5.2% spoke [[South African English|English]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://census.adrianfrith.com/place/10706 |title=Main Place 'Paarl' |work=Census 2001 |accessdate=2 April 2011}}</ref>\n[[File:Toringkerk noordaansig.JPG|thumb|281x281px|The Tower Church in central Paarl]]\n\n== Tourist attractions ==\n[[File:Paarl mountains.jpg|thumb|Paarl Rock]]\n[[File:Taalmonument 2.JPG|thumb|left|[[Afrikaanse Taalmonument]] in Paarl|150px]]\nLike many towns in the Cape Winelands, Paarl is home to a prosperous community, with many well maintained and attractive [[Cape Dutch architecture|Cape Dutch houses]], beautiful gardens and streets lined with old oak trees.\n\nPaarl boasts a unique cultural attraction: it was here that the foundations of the [[Afrikaans language]] were laid by the [[Genootskap van Regte Afrikaners]]. The \"[[Afrikaanse Taalmonument]]\" (monument to the Afrikaans language) on the slopes of Paarl Mountain, the Language Museum (Taalmuseum) and the Afrikaans Language Route through Dal Josaphat are memorials to this achievement.\n\nThe former headquarters of the [[wine]] industry in South Africa is also situated here. This was the famous \"Co-operative Wine Growers' Association\" (better known by its Afrikaans initials KWV). [[KWV]] became a South African institution that has acquired an international reputation based on its unique achievements and its imprint of quality on the local wine industry. Over the past decade, however, KWV has been privatized and no longer has an administrative role in the South African wine industry. (KWV's main wine production and maturation facilities are on its Paarl premises, while its [[brandy]] production takes place in [[Worcester, Western Cape|Worcester]] and grape juice concentrate production in [[Upington]] in the [[Northern Cape]].)\n\nThe town and its surroundings attract many visitors with an array of activities and interests. There are magnificent Cape Dutch buildings (17-19th Century), scenic drives, hiking trails, excellent restaurants and the Paarl wine route, with its many [[wine tasting]] opportunities.<ref>{{Cite web|title = Things to do in Paarl {{!}} Paarl Directory|url = http://www.paarldirectory.co.za/|website = www.paarldirectory.co.za|accessdate = 2016-02-29}}</ref>\n\nThe old [[Spice route paarl|Spice Route Paarl]], which was initiated in 1997 by [[Charles Back]], the owner of this estate as well as of [[Fairview Wine and Cheese|Fairview]], provides an opportunity for visitors to appreciate and taste local delicacies from the [[Western Cape]], like biltong, draft beer or red and white wines from the surrounding wine yards in Malmesbury and Darling.

However, in the pioneering period of [[rock climbing]] in South Africa, the mountain was ignored or shunned because its steep faces were so smooth and unfissured that climbers could find no place to attach \"runners\" or anchor points for [[belay]]s. The first climbing routes up the rock were pioneered in 1969 by J. W. Marchant and G. Athiros, the former from the [[University of Cape Town]] Mountain and Ski Club. Soon afterwards Marchant and John Knight established a few routes on which the rope was run out for {{convert|100|m|ft|abbr=on}} or more with no protection whatsoever.<ref name=\"UCTMSC1970\">''Annual Bulletin.'' University of Cape Town Mountain and Ski Club (UCTMSC), 1970.</ref> This was in the days before bolting was possible, and these achievements are still held in high regard today. Nowadays protection is afforded by bolts in the granite, and there are on Paarl Rock a few dozen spectacular, beautiful and very hard routes that attract the best climbers of the current generation. (All of these climbs remain dangerous for the inexperienced.)  A guidebook for these routes was written in 2006 by Stewart & Scott Noy, who lived at the foot of the mountain and were developing many of the new routes at the time.\n\n==Districts==\n\nAmongst the neighbourhoods include De Zoete Inval (a middle-class suburb in the south); Courtrai (a wealthy suburb in the southern part of town); Central Paarl (generally known as Upper-Paarl and also containing a lot of wealthy suburbs, popular area for local Jews); Lemoenkloof (a wealthy suburb between the central and northern parts of town); Northern Paarl (middle-class suburb, including the area of Groenvlei); Denneburg (in the south-east of the town); Vrykyk (in the south) and areas in the eastern part of the town such as New Orleans, New York, Amstelhof, Lantana and Klein Nederburg.\n\nThere are also large gated communities developed towards the South of the town on the way to Franschhoek, such as Boschenmeer (golf estate), [[Val de Vie Estate]] (polo estate) and Pearl Valley (golf estate).\n\n==Education==\n\nThe town boasts some of the best governmental academic high schools in the country including [[Paarl Gimnasium|Paarl Gimnasium High School]] (est. 1858), [[La Rochelle Girls' High School]] (est.1860), [[Paarl Boys' High School]] (est.1868), Paulus Joubert High, New Orleans Secondary, Klein Nederburg Secondary and Paarl Girls' High. Paarl Girls' High was placed 17th in the National Senior Certificate's \"Excellence in academic performance\" awards in 2012. New Orleans Secondary is the school where the Miss South Africa (2018), Tamaryn Green, completed her secondary education. Independent schools such as Simond Private School (est. 1852) and Bridge House also feature in this region. Bridge House, listed as one of the most expensive independent schools in South Africa, offers boarding facilities. These schools offer the IEB examinations as distinct from the National Senior Certificate offered by government schools. <ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.info.gov.za/speeches/docs/2013/wc_top_schools.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-06-13 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130612210657/http://www.info.gov.za/speeches/docs/2013/wc_top_schools.pdf |archivedate=12 June 2013 |df=dmy-all }}</ref>\n\n==Climate==\n\n{{Weather box\n|width = auto\n|location = Paarl\n|metric first = yes\n|single line = yes\n\n|Jan high C = 29.7\n|Feb high C = 30.0\n|Mar high C = 28.6\n|Apr high C = 24.8\n|May high C = 20.7\n|Jun high C = 18.6\n|Jul high C = 17.7\n|Aug high C = 18.4\n|Sep high C = 20.5\n|Oct high C = 23.6\n|Nov high C = 26.7\n|Dec high C = 28.4\n\n| Jan mean C = 22.7\n| Feb mean C = 23.0\n| Mar mean C = 21.6\n| Apr mean C = 18.3\n| May mean C = 14.9\n| Jun mean C = 12.8\n| Jul mean C = 12.0\n| Aug mean C = 12.7\n| Sep mean C = 14.5\n| Oct mean C = 17.2\n| Nov mean C = 19.9\n| Dec mean C = 21.5\n\n|Jan low C = 15.8\n|Feb low C = 16.1\n|Mar low C = 14.6\n|Apr low C = 11.8\n|May low C = 9.1\n|Jun low C = 7.0\n|Jul low C = 6.3\n|Aug low C = 7.0\n|Sep low C = 8.6\n|Oct low C = 10.9\n|Nov low C = 13.2\n|Dec low C = 14.7\n\n|precipitation colour = green\n|Jan precipitation mm = 16\n|Feb precipitation mm = 21\n|Mar precipitation mm = 26\n|Apr precipitation mm = 73\n|May precipitation mm = 117\n|Jun precipitation mm = 132\n|Jul precipitation mm = 116\n|Aug precipitation mm = 109\n|Sep precipitation mm = 61\n|Oct precipitation mm = 49\n|Nov precipitation mm = 29\n|Dec precipitation mm = 21\n\n|source 1 = Climate-Data.org <ref name = Climate-Data.org >{{cite web\n| url = https://en.climate-data.org/location/9597/\n| title = Climate: Paarl\n| accessdate = April 14, 2018 }}</ref>\n}}\n\n== Notable residents ==\n{{Div col|colwidth=30em}}\n*[[Kathleen Aerts]] - Belgian singer\n*[[Lynne Brown]] - former [[Premier of the Western Cape]]\n*[[Archie Crail]] - writer\n*[[Willem de Waal]] - rugby union player\n*[[Jean de Villiers]] - rugby union player\n*[[Peter de Villiers]] - former coach of the [[South Africa national rugby union team]] (Springboks)\n*[[Deetlefs du Toit]] \u2013 former South African politician \n*[[Stephanus Jacobus du Toit]] - ''Taalstryder'' (language warrior)\n*[[Totius (poet)|Jacob Dani\u00ebl du Toit (Totius)]] - (Born Paarl 1877) poet and ''Taalstryder''\n*[[David James (South African actor)|David James]] - actor\n*[[Wilmot James]] - former Member of Parliament\n*[[Elsa Joubert]] - author\n*[[Marius Joubert|Marius Charl Joubert]] - rugby union player\n*[[Wayne Julies]] - rugby union player\n*[[Margaret Lawder]] - botanist\n*[[Nelson Mandela]] - released from Victor Vester Prison in Paarl on 11 February 1990\n*[[Eug\u00e8ne Marais]] - author and poet\n*[[Deon Meyer]] - thriller novelist\n*[[Ryk Neethling]] - swimmer and Olympian\n*[[Justin Ontong|Justin Lee Ontong]] - cricketer [[Cape Cobras]]\n*[[Conrad Poole]] \u2013 mayor of the Drakenstein\n*[[Karel Schoeman]] - author\n*[[Gurthro Steenkamp]] - rugby union player\n*[[Louis Weichardt|Louis Theodor Weichardt]] - founder and leader of the [[Greyshirts]]\n*[[Chester Williams|Chester Mornay Williams]] - rugby union player\n\n{{div col end}}\n\n==Coats of arms==\n'''Municipality (1)''' \u2014 On 18 July 1905, the municipal council accepted a coat of arms presented by {{Interlanguage link multi|Adriaan Moorrees|af}}.<ref name=paarl1>Western Cape Archives : Paarl Municipal Minutes (18 July 1905).</ref>  It was the arms of Hendrik van Reede van Drakenstein : a silver shield charged with two dancetty black bars and crowned with a golden coronet.

The \"diamonds\" disappeared from the name, and it became known simply as Pearl Rock or Pearl Mountain.\n\nIn 1687, Governor [[Simon van der Stel]] gave the title to the first colonial farms in the area to \"free burghers\". The following year, the French [[Huguenots]] arrived in the [[Western Cape]] and began to settle on farms in the area.<ref name=\"paarlonline.com\"/>  The fertile soil and the [[Mediterranean]]-like climate of this region provided perfect conditions for farming. The settlers planted [[orchards]], [[vegetable]] [[gardens]] and, above all, [[vineyards]].<ref name=\"Pinkerton\">[https://books.google.com/books?id=xiEnAAAAMAAJ&pg=PA10&as_brr=1&ei=Sc6IR8WKNYXc6wLt75mVBg A General Collection of the Best and Most Interesting Voyages and Travels in All Parts of the World, Vol XVI.] John Pinkerton, 1814.

This was the result of a Reverend GWA van der Lingen idea who tried to motivate and convince people of his principles. The congregation would raise funds and begin construction of a church that would later be known as the \"Toring Kerk\" (Tower Church). Construction finished in 1905. The church contains materials imported from London and Egypt.<ref>NG Toringkerk pamphlet handed out by the church itself </ref>\n\nThe arrival of the European settlers brought on a conflict with the [[Khoikhoi]] people, as land and water resources began to be contested and the [[Khoi]] traditions of communal land use came in conflict with the settler's concept of private property.  The Khoi peoples were defeated in local war and were further decimated by European diseases. The population scattered inland toward the [[Orange River]] or became labourers on settler farms.<ref name=\"paarlonline.com\"/>\n\n==Demographics==\nIn the [[South African National Census of 2001|2001 census]] Paarl's population was recorded as being 82,713 people in 20,138 households, in a land area of {{convert|32.2|km2}}. 67.8% of the inhabitants described themselves as \"[[Coloured]]\", 21.2% as \"[[White South African|White]]\", 10.5% as \"[[Black African]]\", and 0.5% as \"[[Indian South African|Indian]] or [[Asian South African|Asian]]\". 85.5% spoke [[Afrikaans language|Afrikaans]] as their [[first language]], 8.5% spoke [[Xhosa language|Xhosa]], and 5.2% spoke [[South African English|English]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://census.adrianfrith.com/place/10706 |title=Main Place 'Paarl' |work=Census 2001 |accessdate=2 April 2011}}</ref>\n[[File:Toringkerk noordaansig.JPG|thumb|281x281px|The Tower Church in central Paarl]]\n\n== Tourist attractions ==\n[[File:Paarl mountains.jpg|thumb|Paarl Rock]]\n[[File:Taalmonument 2.JPG|thumb|left|[[Afrikaanse Taalmonument]] in Paarl|150px]]\nLike many towns in the Cape Winelands, Paarl is home to a prosperous community, with many well maintained and attractive [[Cape Dutch architecture|Cape Dutch houses]], beautiful gardens and streets lined with old oak trees.\n\nPaarl boasts a unique cultural attraction: it was here that the foundations of the [[Afrikaans language]] were laid by the [[Genootskap van Regte Afrikaners]]. The \"[[Afrikaanse Taalmonument]]\" (monument to the Afrikaans language) on the slopes of Paarl Mountain, the Language Museum (Taalmuseum) and the Afrikaans Language Route through Dal Josaphat are memorials to this achievement.\n\nThe former headquarters of the [[wine]] industry in South Africa is also situated here. This was the famous \"Co-operative Wine Growers' Association\" (better known by its Afrikaans initials KWV). [[KWV]] became a South African institution that has acquired an international reputation based on its unique achievements and its imprint of quality on the local wine industry. Over the past decade, however, KWV has been privatized and no longer has an administrative role in the South African wine industry. (KWV's main wine production and maturation facilities are on its Paarl premises, while its [[brandy]] production takes place in [[Worcester, Western Cape|Worcester]] and grape juice concentrate production in [[Upington]] in the [[Northern Cape]].)\n\nThe town and its surroundings attract many visitors with an array of activities and interests. There are magnificent Cape Dutch buildings (17-19th Century), scenic drives, hiking trails, excellent restaurants and the Paarl wine route, with its many [[wine tasting]] opportunities.<ref>{{Cite web|title = Things to do in Paarl {{!}} Paarl Directory|url = http://www.paarldirectory.co.za/|website = www.paarldirectory.co.za|accessdate = 2016-02-29}}</ref>\n\nThe old [[Spice route paarl|Spice Route Paarl]], which was initiated in 1997 by [[Charles Back]], the owner of this estate as well as of [[Fairview Wine and Cheese|Fairview]], provides an opportunity for visitors to appreciate and taste local delicacies from the [[Western Cape]], like biltong, draft beer or red and white wines from the surrounding wine yards in Malmesbury and Darling.

However, in the pioneering period of [[rock climbing]] in South Africa, the mountain was ignored or shunned because its steep faces were so smooth and unfissured that climbers could find no place to attach \"runners\" or anchor points for [[belay]]s. The first climbing routes up the rock were pioneered in 1969 by J. W. Marchant and G. Athiros, the former from the [[University of Cape Town]] Mountain and Ski Club. Soon afterwards Marchant and John Knight established a few routes on which the rope was run out for {{convert|100|m|ft|abbr=on}} or more with no protection whatsoever.<ref name=\"UCTMSC1970\">''Annual Bulletin.'' University of Cape Town Mountain and Ski Club (UCTMSC), 1970.</ref> This was in the days before bolting was possible, and these achievements are still held in high regard today. Nowadays protection is afforded by bolts in the granite, and there are on Paarl Rock a few dozen spectacular, beautiful and very hard routes that attract the best climbers of the current generation. (All of these climbs remain dangerous for the inexperienced.)  A guidebook for these routes was written in 2006 by Stewart & Scott Noy, who lived at the foot of the mountain and were developing many of the new routes at the time.\n\n==Districts==\n\nAmongst the neighbourhoods include De Zoete Inval (a middle-class suburb in the south); Courtrai (a wealthy suburb in the southern part of town); Central Paarl (generally known as Upper-Paarl and also containing a lot of wealthy suburbs, popular area for local Jews); Lemoenkloof (a wealthy suburb between the central and northern parts of town); Northern Paarl (middle-class suburb, including the area of Groenvlei); Denneburg (in the south-east of the town); Vrykyk (in the south) and areas in the eastern part of the town such as New Orleans, New York, Amstelhof, Lantana and Klein Nederburg.\n\nThere are also large gated communities developed towards the South of the town on the way to Franschhoek, such as Boschenmeer (golf estate), [[Val de Vie Estate]] (polo estate) and Pearl Valley (golf estate).\n\n==Education==\n\nThe town boasts some of the best governmental academic high schools in the country including [[Paarl Gimnasium|Paarl Gimnasium High School]] (est. 1858), [[La Rochelle Girls' High School]] (est.1860), [[Paarl Boys' High School]] (est.1868), Paulus Joubert High, New Orleans Secondary, Klein Nederburg Secondary and Paarl Girls' High. Paarl Girls' High was placed 17th in the National Senior Certificate's \"Excellence in academic performance\" awards in 2012. New Orleans Secondary is the school where the Miss South Africa (2018), Tamaryn Green, completed her secondary education. Independent schools such as Simond Private School (est. 1852) and Bridge House also feature in this region. Bridge House, listed as one of the most expensive independent schools in South Africa, offers boarding facilities. These schools offer the IEB examinations as distinct from the National Senior Certificate offered by government schools. <ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.info.gov.za/speeches/docs/2013/wc_top_schools.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-06-13 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130612210657/http://www.info.gov.za/speeches/docs/2013/wc_top_schools.pdf |archivedate=12 June 2013 |df=dmy-all }}</ref>\n\n==Climate==\n\n{{Weather box\n|width = auto\n|location = Paarl\n|metric first = yes\n|single line = yes\n\n|Jan high C = 29.7\n|Feb high C = 30.0\n|Mar high C = 28.6\n|Apr high C = 24.8\n|May high C = 20.7\n|Jun high C = 18.6\n|Jul high C = 17.7\n|Aug high C = 18.4\n|Sep high C = 20.5\n|Oct high C = 23.6\n|Nov high C = 26.7\n|Dec high C = 28.4\n\n| Jan mean C = 22.7\n| Feb mean C = 23.0\n| Mar mean C = 21.6\n| Apr mean C = 18.3\n| May mean C = 14.9\n| Jun mean C = 12.8\n| Jul mean C = 12.0\n| Aug mean C = 12.7\n| Sep mean C = 14.5\n| Oct mean C = 17.2\n| Nov mean C = 19.9\n| Dec mean C = 21.5\n\n|Jan low C = 15.8\n|Feb low C = 16.1\n|Mar low C = 14.6\n|Apr low C = 11.8\n|May low C = 9.1\n|Jun low C = 7.0\n|Jul low C = 6.3\n|Aug low C = 7.0\n|Sep low C = 8.6\n|Oct low C = 10.9\n|Nov low C = 13.2\n|Dec low C = 14.7\n\n|precipitation colour = green\n|Jan precipitation mm = 16\n|Feb precipitation mm = 21\n|Mar precipitation mm = 26\n|Apr precipitation mm = 73\n|May precipitation mm = 117\n|Jun precipitation mm = 132\n|Jul precipitation mm = 116\n|Aug precipitation mm = 109\n|Sep precipitation mm = 61\n|Oct precipitation mm = 49\n|Nov precipitation mm = 29\n|Dec precipitation mm = 21\n\n|source 1 = Climate-Data.org <ref name = Climate-Data.org >{{cite web\n| url = https://en.climate-data.org/location/9597/\n| title = Climate: Paarl\n| accessdate = April 14, 2018 }}</ref>\n}}\n\n== Notable residents ==\n{{Div col|colwidth=30em}}\n*[[Kathleen Aerts]] - Belgian singer\n*[[Lynne Brown]] - former [[Premier of the Western Cape]]\n*[[Archie Crail]] - writer\n*[[Willem de Waal]] - rugby union player\n*[[Jean de Villiers]] - rugby union player\n*[[Peter de Villiers]] - former coach of the [[South Africa national rugby union team]] (Springboks)\n*[[Stephanus Jacobus du Toit]] - ''Taalstryder'' (language warrior)\n*[[Totius (poet)|Jacob Dani\u00ebl du Toit (Totius)]] - (Born Paarl 1877) poet and ''Taalstryder''\n*[[David James (South African actor)|David James]] - actor\n*[[Wilmot James]] - former Member of Parliament\n*[[Elsa Joubert]] - author\n*[[Marius Joubert|Marius Charl Joubert]] - rugby union player\n*[[Wayne Julies]] - rugby union player\n*[[Margaret Lawder]] - botanist\n*[[Nelson Mandela]] - released from Victor Vester Prison in Paarl on 11 February 1990\n*[[Eug\u00e8ne Marais]] - author and poet\n*[[Deon Meyer]] - thriller novelist\n*[[Ryk Neethling]] - swimmer and Olympian\n*[[Justin Ontong|Justin Lee Ontong]] - cricketer [[Cape Cobras]]\n*[[Karel Schoeman]] - author\n*[[Gurthro Steenkamp]] - rugby union player\n*[[Louis Weichardt|Louis Theodor Weichardt]] - founder and leader of the [[Greyshirts]]\n*[[Chester Williams|Chester Mornay Williams]] - rugby union player\n\n{{div col end}}\n\n==Coats of arms==\n'''Municipality (1)''' \u2014 On 18 July 1905, the municipal council accepted a coat of arms presented by {{Interlanguage link multi|Adriaan Moorrees|af}}.<ref name=paarl1>Western Cape Archives : Paarl Municipal Minutes (18 July 1905).</ref>  It was the arms of Hendrik van Reede van Drakenstein : a silver shield charged with two dancetty black bars and crowned with a golden coronet.

Between 1974 and 1978, the [[Law Enforcement Assistance Administration]] reported spending roughly $26 million ($115 million in 2020 dollars) to fund 378 crime prevention projects with an Operation Identification component. Police departments would sponsor Operation Identification programs for residents, and many neighborhood organizations promoted and implemented marking programs.<ref name=gao>{{cite web |url=https://www.gao.gov/assets/130/126467.pdf  |title=Memo B-171019 |last= |first= |date= |publisher=Government Accountability Office |access-date=2020-04-11}}</ref>\n\nProperty marking was also encouraged by private companies and insurance companies. A national insurance association offered clients free engravers, literature, and participation stickers with other insurance companies offering discounts to clients who marked their property. One company provided customers a service where they would be provided an engraver, window stickers, and inventory sheets. Then the identity and current address of the enrolee, along with the assigned number, were stored in a data bank for retrieval.<ref name=gao/>\n\nMost of the effort to encourage property marking was aimed at the personal property of private citizens but some businesses along with state and local governmental units also participated.<ref name=gao/>\n\nA 1979 survey by the [[Government Accountability Office]] (GAO) primarily performed in New York State and at federal agencies in [[Washington D.C.]] indicated that Operation Identification was being widely implemented and showing benefits although it had not been pursued by any Federal agency.

However, the evaluation reported that burglars did not find it more difficult to dispose of marked property and that marked property recovered by police was not more likely to be returned to the owners. The evaluation stated the absence of a unique and permanent identifier for each property owner in the United States as a reason for these shortcomings of the program.<ref name=gao/>\n\n==Current use==\nOperation Identification is still endorsed by police in the United States with many departments actively promoting the program.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.cityoftaylor.com/655/Operation-Identification  |title=Operation Identification |last= |first= |date= |publisher=City of Taylor |access-date=2020-04-11}}</ref> As well as police departments, Operation Identification is encouraged for students by colleges across the country.<ref name=\"Operation Identification\"/>\n\nThere are some private companies that partner directly with the police, giving them ready access to [[serial number]]s collected and entered by citizens.

If an account holder is a victim of a crime, it is up to them to provide police with serial numbers, so they can be entered into the [[National Crime Information Center]]. This strategy, via the internet, also connects a [[Good Samaritan]] with the rightful owner if the identifying tag is intact, using a regulated [[Anonymous P2P]] communication strategy.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://mypropertyidregistry.com/  |title=My Property ID Registry |last= |first= |date= |publisher= |access-date=2020-04-11}}</ref>\n\n===Outside the United States===\nIn the [[United Kingdom]], the [[Metropolitan Police]] recommend similar property marking techniques to Operation Identification.

Between 1974 and 1978, the [[Law Enforcement Assistance Administration]] reported roughly $26 million ($115 million in 2020 dollars) of funding for 378 crime prevention projects with an Operation Identification component. Police departments would sponsor Operation Identification programs for residents, and many neighborhood organizations promoted and implemented marking programs.<ref name=gao>{{cite web |url=https://www.gao.gov/assets/130/126467.pdf  |title=Memo B-171019 |last= |first= |date= |publisher=Government Accountability Office |access-date=2020-04-11}}</ref>\n\nProperty marking was also encouraged by private companies and insurance companies. A national insurance association offered clients free engravers, literature, and participation stickers with other insurance companies offering discounts to clients who marked their property. One company provided customers a service where they would be provided an engraver, window stickers, and inventory sheets. Then the identity and current address of the enrolee, along with the assigned number, were stored in a data bank for retrieval.<ref name=gao/>\n\nMost of the effort to encourage property marking was aimed at the personal property of private citizens but some businesses along with state and local governmental units also participated.<ref name=gao/>\n\nA 1979 survey by the [[Government Accountability Office]] (GAO) primarily performed in New York State and at federal agencies in [[Washington D.C.]] indicated that Operation Identification was being widely implemented and showing benefits although it had not been pursued by any Federal agency. Of the 28 police departments contacted during the survey, 21 were implementing property marking programs.<ref name=gao/> Following this survey, Operation Identification was rolled out by the US Department of Justice in 1979.<ref name=\":1979\">{{cite web |url=https://mypropertyidregistry.com/2017/06/21/government-accountability-office-gao-validates-operation-identification-1979/  |title=Government Accountability Office (GAO) Validates Operation Identification |last= |first= |date=2017-06-21 |publisher=My Property ID Registry |access-date=2020-04-11}}</ref>\n\nThe program was endorsed by the:<ref name=\":1979\"/>\n\n*[[National Sheriff's Association]]\n*[[International Association of Chiefs of Police]]\n*[[Federal Bureau of Investigation]]\n*[[National Crime Information Center]]\n*[[National Crime Prevention Association]]\n*[[National Council on Crime and Delinquency]]\n*[[Independent insurance agent|Independent Insurance Agents and Brokers of America]]<ref>[https://www.independentagent.com/default.aspx Independent Insurance Agents and Brokers of America]</ref>\n*[[American Farm Bureau]]\n*[[Law Enforcement Assistance Administration]]\n\n===Identifiers===\nOperation Identification was hindered by the lack of a single unique identifier or a system of identifiers being installed to aid police operations.

However, the evaluation reported that burglars did not find it more difficult to dispose of marked property and that marked property recovered by police was not more likely to be returned to the owners. The evaluation stated the absence of a unique and permanent identifier for each property owner in the United States as a reason for these shortcomings of the program.<ref name=gao/>\n\n==Current use==\nOperation Identification is still endorsed by police in the United States with many departments actively promoting the program.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.cityoftaylor.com/655/Operation-Identification  |title=Operation Identification |last= |first= |date= |publisher=City of Taylor |access-date=2020-04-11}}</ref> As well as police departments, Operation Identification is encouraged for students by colleges across the country.<ref name=\"Operation Identification\"/>\n\nThere are some private companies that partner directly with the police, giving them ready access to [[serial number]]s collected and entered by citizens.

If an account holder is a victim of a crime, it is up to them to provide police with serial numbers, so they can be entered into the [[National Crime Information Center]].

The carving displays a number of small alterations from the original painting, including the addition of an extra [[sarcophagus]] placed on top of the main tomb. Below the relief is a stone plaque displaying a ten-letter inscription. The inscription is broken into two lines. There are eight letters on the first line, and two below on the second line, placed at either end of the letters on the first line. The letters on the second line, D M, were commonly used on Roman tombs to stand for ''[[List of classical abbreviations|Dis Manibus]]'', meaning \"dedicated to the [[Manes|shades]]\".\n\n==Theories==\n\nIn recent decades, investigators have proposed several possible solutions. \n\n* One suggestion is that the eight letters are a coded dedication by George Anson to his deceased wife.  In 1951 Morchard Bishop speculated that the letters might be an [[Acronym and initialism|initialism]] for the Latin phrase ''Optimae Uxoris Optimae Sororis Viduus Amantissimus Vovit Virtutibus'' (\"Best of wives, Best of sisters, a most devoted Widower dedicates (this) to your virtues\").<ref name=ShMon2>{{cite web|url=http://www.shugborough.org.uk/AcademyShepherdsMon-169|title=The Shepherd's Monument|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110610051503/http://www.shugborough.org.uk/AcademyShepherdsMon-169|archivedate=10 June 2011|publisher=[[Staffordshire County Council]]}}</ref> \n* Steve Regimbal interprets the letters as standing for a new Latin translation of the phrase \"Vanity of vanities, saith the preacher; all is vanity.\" ({{sourcetext|source=Bible|version=King James|book=Ecclesiastes|chapter=12|verse=8}}), namely ''Orator Ut Omnia Sunt Vanitas Ait Vanitas Vanitatum''.

The solution provides a detailed decryption effort which asserts that a polyalphabetic cipher was used to encrypt the name \"Magdalen\".<ref>{{cite book |last=Ramsden |first=Dave |title= Unveiling the Mystic Ciphers: Thomas Anson and the Shepherd's Monument Inscription |publisher= Dave Ramsden|date=December 2014|isbn= 1503119882 }}</ref>\n* The author and researcher George Edmunds in his book ''Anson's Gold'' proposes that everyone has overlooked the fact that Lord George Anson was a naval man. His creation of the cipher was to hide the latitude and longitude (alphanumerical code) of an island on which was buried a huge Spanish treasure. He mounted a secret expedition in the 18th century to recover this treasure,  which was located but due to unforeseen circumstances remains in place. Letters (in code) sent back to Lord Anson by the expedition leader validate and include part of the cipher, proof this is what the cipher was for.<ref>(''Anson's Gold'', published 2016)</ref>\n\nDespite the many theories, staff at Shugborough Hall remain sceptical of all proposed solutions.

They are made of glass [[tessera]]e and were executed in [[Byzantine mosaics|Byzantine style]] between the late 12th and the mid-13th centuries by both local and Venetians masters<ref name=\"TCI\">{{cite book|title=Guida d'Italia|publisher=Touring Club Italiano}}</ref>. With the exception of a high [[Dado (architecture)|dado]], made of marble slabs with bands of mosaic between them, the whole interior surface of the walls, including [[soffit]]s and [[jamb]]s of all the arches, is covered with minute mosaic-pictures in bright colors on a gold ground. The mosaic pictures, depicting stories from both the [[Old Testament|Old]] and [[New Testament]], are arranged in tiers, divided by horizontal and vertical bands. In parts of the choir there are five of these tiers of subjects or single figures one above another.\n\nThe half dome of the central apse has a colossal half-length figure of Christ, with a seated Virgin and Child below; the other apses have full-length figures of [[St Peter]] and [[Paul of Tarsus|St Paul]]. Inscriptions on each picture explain the subject or saint represented; these are in Latin, except some few which are in Greek. The subjects in the nave begin with scenes from the [[Book of Genesis]], illustrating the [[Old Testament]] types of Christ and His scheme of redemption, with figures of those who prophesied and prepared for His coming. Around the lower tier and the choir are subjects from the [[New Testament]], chiefly representing Christ's miracles and suffering, with apostles, evangelists and other saints. The design, execution and choice of subjects all appear to be of [[Byzantine art|Byzantine origin]], the subjects being selected from the ''[[Menologion of Basil II]]'' drawn up by the emperor [[Basil II]] in the 10th century.\n\n== By location<ref>{{in lang|it}} Michele del Giudice in ''Descrizione Del Real Tempio, E Monasterio Di Santa Maria Nuova, di Morreale''.</ref> ==\n\n=== Inner facade ===\n\n[[File:Monreale BW 2012-10-09 09-32-41.JPG|center|250px|''Madonna col Bambino''.]]\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!

A personal diary may include a person's experiences, thoughts, and/or feelings, excluding comments on current events outside the writer's direct experience. Someone who keeps a diary is known as a [[list of diarists|diarist]]. Diaries undertaken for institutional purposes play a role in many aspects of human civilization, including government records (e.g. ''[[Hansard]]''), business [[ledger]]s, and military [[Service record|record]]s. In British English, the word may also denote [[diary (stationery)|a preprinted journal format]]. A diary is a collection of notes. \n\nToday the term is generally employed for personal diaries, normally intended to remain private or to have a limited circulation amongst friends or relatives. The word \"[[Journal (disambiguation)|journal]]\" may be sometimes used for \"diary,\" but generally a diary has (or intends to have) daily entries, whereas journal-writing can be less frequent.\n\nAlthough a diary may provide information for a [[memoir]], [[autobiography]] or [[biography]], it is generally written not with the intention of being published as it stands, but for the author's own use. In recent years, however, there is internal evidence in some diaries (e.g. those of [[Ned Rorem]], [[Alan Clark]], [[Tony Benn]] or [[Simon Gray]]) that they are written with eventual publication in mind, with the intention of self-vindication (pre- or posthumous), or simply for profit.\n\nBy extension the term '''diary''' is also used to mean a printed publication of a written diary; and may also refer to other terms of journal including electronic formats (e.g. [[blog]]s).\n\n==Etymology==\nThe word ''diary'' comes from the [[Latin]] ''diarium'' (\"daily allowance,\" from ''dies'' \"day\").<ref>{{cite dictionary| url= http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/diary|title= Diary|dictionary= Merriam-Webster |accessdate=7 June 2012}}</ref> The word ''journal'' comes from the same root (''diurnus'' \"of the day\") through [[Old French]] ''jurnal'' (modern [[French language|French]] for ''day'' is ''jour'').<ref>{{cite dictionary| url= http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/journal?show=0&t=1341691218|title=Journal|dictionary= Merriam-Webster |accessdate=7 June 2012}}</ref>\n\nThe earliest use of the word refers to a book in which a daily record was written was in [[Ben Jonson]]'s comedy ''[[Volpone]]'' in 1605.<ref>{{cite dictionary| url= http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=diary&allowed_in_frame=0|title=Diary|dictionary= Online Etymology Dictionary|accessdate=22 June 2012}}</ref>\n\n==History==\nThe oldest extant diaries come from [[Middle East]]ern and [[East Asia]]n cultures, although the even earlier work ''To Myself'' (\u03a4\u1f70 \u03b5\u1f30\u03c2 \u1f11\u03b1\u03c5\u03c4\u03cc\u03bd), today known as the ''[[Meditations]]'', written in Greek by the Roman Emperor [[Marcus Aurelius]] in the second half of the 2nd century AD, already displays many characteristics of a diary. [[Pillowbook]]s of [[Japan]]ese court ladies and [[Asia]]n travel journals offer some aspects of this genre of writing, although they rarely consist exclusively of diurnal records. The scholar [[Li Ao (philosopher)|Li Ao]] (9th century AD), for example, kept a diary of his journey through southern China.\n\nIn the [[Islamic Golden Age|medieval Near East]], [[Arabic literature|Arabic]] diaries were written from before the 10th century. The earliest surviving diary of this era which most resembles the modern diary was that of Ibn Banna' in the 11th century. His diary is the earliest known to be arranged in order of date (''ta'rikh'' in Arabic), very much like modern diaries.<ref>{{Cite journal|title=The Diary in Islamic Historiography: Some Notes|first=George|last=Makdisi|journal=History and Theory|volume=25|issue=2|date=May 1986|pages=173\u201385|doi=10.2307/2505304|postscript=<!--None-->|jstor=2505304}}</ref>\n\nThe precursors of the diary in the modern sense include daily notes of [[Christian mysticism|medieval mystics]], concerned mostly with inward emotions and outward events perceived as spiritually important (e.g. [[Elizabeth of Sch\u00f6nau]], [[Agnes Blannbekin]], and perhaps also, in the lost vernacular account of her visions, [[Beatrice of Nazareth]]).\n\nFrom the [[Renaissance]] on, some individuals wanted not only to record events, as in medieval chronicles and itineraries, but also to put down their own opinions and express their hopes and fears, without any intention to publish these notes. One of the early preserved examples is the anonymous ''Journal d'un bourgeois de Paris'' that covers the years 1405\u201349, giving subjective commentaries on the current events. Famous 14th- to 16th-century Renaissance examples, which appeared much later as books, were the diaries by the [[Florence|Florentines]] [[Buonaccorso Pitti]] and [[Gregorio Dati]] and the [[Venice|Venetian]] [[Marino Sanuto the Younger]]. Here we find records of even less important everyday occurrences together with much reflection, emotional experience and personal impressions.\n\nIn 1908, the [[Smythson]] company created the first featherweight diary,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.smythson.com/corporate-diaries|title=Smythson.com}}</ref> enabling diaries to be carried about.<ref>p.181 Moss, Victoria ''The Archivists'' ''In Style'' October 2012</ref>\n\n==Published diaries==\n[[Image:Samuel Pepys.jpg|155px|right|thumb|[[Samuel Pepys]]]]\n[[Image:200px-Faustina.jpg|155px|right|thumb|[[Faustina Kowalska]]]]\n\nMany diaries of notable figures have been published and form an important element of [[autobiography|autobiographical]] literature.\n\n[[Samuel Pepys]] (1633\u20131703) is the earliest diarist who is well known today; his diaries, preserved in [[Magdalene College, Cambridge]], were first transcribed and published in 1825. Pepys was amongst the first who took the diary beyond mere business transaction notation, into the realm of the personal. Pepys' contemporary [[John Evelyn]] also kept a notable diary, and their works are among the most important [[primary source]]s for the [[English Restoration]] period, and consist of [[witness|eyewitness]] accounts of many great events, such as the [[Great Plague of London]], and the [[Great Fire of London]].\n\nThe practice of posthumous publication of diaries of literary and other notables began in the 19th century. As examples, the ''Grasmere Journal'' of [[Dorothy Wordsworth]] (1771\u20131855) was published in 1897; the Journals of [[Fanny Burney]] (1752\u20131840) were published in 1889; the diaries of [[Henry Crabb Robinson]] (1776\u20131867) were published in 1869.\n\nAmong important [[U.S. Civil War]] diaries are those of [[George Templeton Strong]], a [[New York City]] lawyer, and [[Mary Boykin Chesnut|Mary Chesnut]], the wife of a [[Confederate States of America|Confederate]] officer. The diary of [[Jemima Condict]], living in the area of what is now [[West Orange, New Jersey]], includes local observations of the [[American Revolutionary War]].\n\nSince the 19th century the publication of diaries by their authors has become commonplace &ndash; notably amongst politicians seeking justification but also amongst artists and litterateurs of all descriptions. Amongst late 20th-century British published political diaries, those of [[Richard Crossman]], [[Tony Benn]] and [[Alan Clark]] are representative, the latter being more indiscreet in the tradition of the diaries of [[Chips Channon]]. In Britain in the field of the arts notable diaries were published by [[James Lees-Milne]], [[Roy Strong]] and [[Peter Hall (theatre director)|Peter Hall]]. [[Harold Nicolson]] in the mid-20th century covered both politics and the arts.\n\nOne of the most famous modern diaries, widely read and translated, is the posthumously published ''[[The Diary of a Young Girl]]'' by [[Anne Frank]], who wrote it while in hiding during the German occupation of [[Amsterdam]] in the 1940s. [[Otto Frank]] edited his daughter's diary and arranged for its publication after the War. Many edits were made before the diary was published in other countries. This was due to the sexually explicit material, which also led to some libraries banning the book.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sparknotes.com/lit/annefrank/section9.rhtml|title=SparkNotes: Diary of a Young Girl: March 14, 1944\u2013April 11, 1944|work=sparknotes.com}}</ref>\n\nThe writing of diaries was also often practiced from the 20th century onwards as a conscious act of self-exploration (of greater or lesser sincerity) &ndash; examples being the diaries of [[Carl Jung]], [[Aleister Crowley]] and [[Ana\u00efs Nin]].<ref>This practice is explored in Tristine Rainer, ''The New Diary'', 1978.</ref> Among important diaries by 20th-century literary figures are those of [[Franz Kafka]], [[Edmund Wilson]] and the French writer Paul L\u00e9autaud (1872\u20131956). The self-reflective ''[[Diary: Divine Mercy in My Soul]]'' written by [[Faustina Kowalska|Saint Faustina]] contains accounts of her visions and conversations with Jesus.\n\nA strong psychological effect may arise from having an audience for one's self-expression, even if this is the book one writes in, only read by oneself \u2013 particularly in adversity. Anne Frank went so far as to address her diary as \"Kitty.\" [[Friedrich Kellner]], a court official in [[Nazi Germany]], thought of his diary as a weapon for any future fight against tyrants and terrorism, and named it \"Mein Widerstand,\" ''[[My Opposition]]''. [[Victor Klemperer]] was similarly concerned with recording for the future the tyrannies and hypocrisies of Nazi Germany and of its [[German Democratic Republic|East German]] successor state in his diaries. In none of these cases, however, did the authors anticipate early \u2013 or indeed any \u2013 publication.\n\n==Internet diaries==\n{{main article|Online diary|Blog}}\n\nAs [[internet]] access became commonly available, many people adopted it as another medium in which to chronicle their lives with the added dimension of an audience. The first [[online diary]] is thought to be Claudio Pinhanez's \"Open Diary,\" published at the [[MIT Media Lab]] website from 14 November 1994 until 1996.<ref>a [https://web.archive.org/web/20091027115535/http://geocities.com/pinhanez/open_diary/open_diary.htm copy] of his \"open diary\" is still in existence</ref> Other early online diarists include [[Justin Hall]], who began eleven years of personal [https://www.lugelo.com/ online diary]-writing in 1994,<ref>{{cite news|url= http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?file=/c/a/2005/02/20/MNGBKBEJO01.DTL|title=Time to get a life \u2014 pioneer blogger Justin Hall bows out at 31|publisher=SFgate|date=20 February 2005|accessdate=9 June 2006 | first=Reyhan | last=Harmanci}}</ref> Carolyn Burke, who started publishing \"Carolyn's Diary\" on 3 January 1995,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://diary.carolyn.org|title=Carolyn's Diary Museum|work=carolyn.org}}</ref> and Bryon Sutherland, who announced his diary ''The Semi-Existence of Bryon'' in a [[USENET]] newsgroup on 19 April 1995.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://groups.google.com/group/comp.infosystems.www.announce/browse_frm/thread/7a77561b5796150e/34c1097809c9529b#34c1097809c9529b|title= USENET announcement|work=google.com}}</ref>\n\nThe internet has also served as a way to bring previously unpublished diaries to the attention of historians and other readers, such as the diary of [[Michael Shiner]], a 19th-century slave who documented his life in Washington, D.C.<ref>[https://www.history.navy.mil/research/library/online-reading-room/title-list-alphabetically/d/diary-of-michael-shiner.html John G.

While the format first focused on external links and topical commentary, widespread blogging tools were quickly used to create web journals. Recent advances have also been made to enable the privacy of internet diary entries. For example, some diary software now stores entries in an encrypted format, such as 256-bit AES ([[Advanced Encryption Standard]]) encryption, and others only permit access to the diary after correct PIN entry on a secure USB device.\n\n==Digital diaries==\n\nWith the popularization of [[mobile apps]], diary or journaling apps have become available for [[iOS]] and [[Android (operating system)|Android]].

One of the earliest printed fictional diaries was the humorous ''[[Diary of a Nobody]]'' by [[George Grossmith]] and his brother Weedon. 20th-century examples include radio broadcasts (e.g. ''[[Mrs. Dale's Diary]]'') and published books (e.g. the ''Diaries of [[Adrian Mole]]''). Both prompted long-running [[satire|satirical]] features in the magazine ''[[Private Eye]]'': the former entitled ''[[Mrs Wilson's Diary]]'' in reference to [[Mary Wilson, Baroness Wilson of Rievaulx|Mary Wilson]], wife of [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom|Prime Minister]] [[Harold Wilson]], the latter entitled \"The Secret Diary of John Major Aged 47\u00be\" and written as a pastiche of the [[Adrian Mole]] diaries from the perspective of the then-Prime Minister [[John Major]]. Another famous example of fictional diaries as prose is Bram Stoker's ''[[Dracula]]''. A modern example includes the [[Diary of a Wimpy Kid series|''Diary of a Wimpy Kid'' series]] where each book of the series is written in a first-person view of the main character, as if the book were an actual diary. Other examples are the ''[[Bert Diaries]]'' and the cellphone diaries in the Japanese [[manga]] and [[anime]] television series ''[[Future Diary]]''.\n\n==See also==\n{{columns-list|colwidth=20em|\n* [[Art diary]]\n* [[Autobiography]]\n* [[Automatic indexing]]\n* [[Coloring diary]]\n* [[Commentarii]]\n* [[Commonplace book]]\n* [[Diary studies]]\n* [[Electronic organizer]]\n* [[Fake memoirs]]\n* [[Hipster PDA]]\n* [[Journal (disambiguation)|Journal]]\n* [[List of books on diaries and journals]]\n* [[List of diarists]]\n* [[List of dream diaries]]\n* [[List of fictional diaries]]\n* [[Nikki bungaku]] / [[Poetic diary]]\n* [[Personal knowledge base]]\n* [[:Category:Diaries]]\n* [[:Category:Diarists]]\n}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==Further reading==\n* Ronald Blythe, ''The Pleasures of Diaries: Four Centuries of Private Writing'' (Pantheon, 1989, {{ISBN|0-394-58017-6}}) \u2014 the book contains selections from (mostly) English diarists' work.\n\n==External links==\n{{wikiquote}}\n{{wiktionary}}\n{{wiktionary|diarist}}\n* [http://www.makeuseof.com/tag/the-beginners-guide-to-digital-journaling/ The Beginner\u2019s Guide to Digital Journaling]\n* [https://doodlecollection.com/ Doodle Diaries]\n* [https://www.coloringdiary.com/ Coloring Diaries]\n* ''[https://www.archives.gov.on.ca/en/explore/online/diaries/index.aspx A Lifetime - Day by Day: Five Women and their Diaries]'', online exhibit on Archives of Ontario website\n\n\n{{Authority control}}\n\n[[Category:Diaries| ]]\n[[Category:Works about history]]\n", "text_old": "{{short description|Written record with discrete entries arranged by date}}\n{{other uses}}\n{{Use dmy dates|date=September 2015}}\n[[File:The Diary of a Young Girl at the Anne Frank Zentrum.jpg|thumb|A [[facsimile]] of the [[The Diary of a Young Girl|original diary]] of [[Anne Frank]] on display in [[Berlin]]]]\n\nA '''diary'''  is a record (originally in handwritten format) with discrete entries arranged by [[Calendar date|date]] reporting on what has happened over the course of a day or other period. A personal diary may include a person's experiences, thoughts, and/or feelings, excluding comments on current events outside the writer's direct experience. Someone who keeps a diary is known as a [[list of diarists|diarist]]. Diaries undertaken for institutional purposes play a role in many aspects of human civilization, including government records (e.g. ''[[Hansard]]''), business [[ledger]]s, and military [[Service record|record]]s. In British English, the word may also denote [[diary (stationery)|a preprinted journal format]].

The first [[online diary]] is thought to be Claudio Pinhanez's \"Open Diary,\" published at the [[MIT Media Lab]] website from 14 November 1994 until 1996.<ref>a [https://web.archive.org/web/20091027115535/http://geocities.com/pinhanez/open_diary/open_diary.htm copy] of his \"open diary\" is still in existence</ref> Other early online diarists include [[Justin Hall]], who began eleven years of personal [https://www.lugelo.com/ online diary]-writing in 1994,<ref>{{cite news|url= http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?file=/c/a/2005/02/20/MNGBKBEJO01.DTL|title=Time to get a life \u2014 pioneer blogger Justin Hall bows out at 31|publisher=SFgate|date=20 February 2005|accessdate=9 June 2006 | first=Reyhan | last=Harmanci}}</ref> Carolyn Burke, who started publishing \"Carolyn's Diary\" on 3 January 1995,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://diary.carolyn.org|title=Carolyn's Diary Museum|work=carolyn.org}}</ref> and Bryon Sutherland, who announced his diary ''The Semi-Existence of Bryon'' in a [[USENET]] newsgroup on 19 April 1995.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://groups.google.com/group/comp.infosystems.www.announce/browse_frm/thread/7a77561b5796150e/34c1097809c9529b#34c1097809c9529b|title= USENET announcement|work=google.com}}</ref>\n\nThe internet has also served as a way to bring previously unpublished diaries to the attention of historians and other readers, such as the diary of [[Michael Shiner]], a 19th-century slave who documented his life in Washington, D.C.<ref>[https://www.history.navy.mil/research/library/online-reading-room/title-list-alphabetically/d/diary-of-michael-shiner.html John G. Sharp,  \"The Diary of Michael Shiner Relating to the History of the Washington Navy Yard 1813-1869, ''Naval History and Heritage Command'', 2015, retrieved October 5, 2016]</ref>\n\nWeb-based services such as [[Open Diary]] (started in October 1998) and [[LiveJournal]] (January 1999) soon appeared to streamline and automate [[online publishing]], but growth in personal storytelling came with the emergence of [[blog]]s. While the format first focused on external links and topical commentary, widespread blogging tools were quickly used to create web journals. Recent advances have also been made to enable the privacy of internet diary entries. For example, some diary software now stores entries in an encrypted format, such as 256-bit AES ([[Advanced Encryption Standard]]) encryption, and others only permit access to the diary after correct PIN entry on a secure USB device.\n\n==Digital diaries==\n\nWith the popularization of [[mobile apps]], diary or journaling apps have become available for [[iOS]] and [[Android (operating system)|Android]]. Proponents cite the following as primary reasons for journaling with digital applications: Ease and speed of typing; mobile portability; search capabilities; entry location, date, and other metadata from mobile phones; and, tags and other organizational features.<ref>{{cite news|url= http://bakarichavanu.com/2014/07/08/10-reasons-i-prefer-digital-journal-writing-over-pen-and-paper/|title=10 Reasons I Prefer Digital Journal Writing Over Pen and Paper|date=14 July 2014| first=Bakari | last=Chavanu}}</ref> Digital diaries also seem tailored towards shorter-form, in-the-moment writing, similar to user engagement with [[Facebook]], [[Twitter]], [[Instagram]], and other social media services.<ref>{{cite web |url = https://www.theverge.com/2012/8/3/3212579/the-best-journal-app-day-one |title =Day One: journal app nirvana in the Twitter age |first = E |last = Hamburger |date = 3 August 2012 |website = [[The Verge]]}}</ref>\n\n==Other forms of diaries==\n\n=== Personal organizer ===\n{{Main|Personal organizer}}\nA personal organizer is a form of diary to list actions and tasks for the day, which are recorded in a log, often using symbols to differentiate and categorize items.<ref name=\"Ward\">{{cite web |last=Ward |first=Jewel |date=18 December 2013 |title=The 'bullet journal': a new time organizing method or a recycled idea? |url=http://www.tamingdata.com/2013/12/18/the-bullet-journal-a-new-time-organizing-method-or-a-recycled-idea/ |website=tamingdata.com |accessdate=2017-12-27}}</ref>\n\n===Diet journal===\nA diet journal or food diary is a daily record of all food and beverage consumed as a means of tracking [[calorie]] consumption for the purpose of weight loss or other nutritional monitoring.\n\n===Gardening journal===\nA gardening journal helps gardeners improve their efforts over time by providing a historical record of actions taken, the weather and other elements and the results.\n\n===Sleep diary===\n{{Main|Sleep diary}}\nA sleep diary or sleep log is a tool used in the diagnosis and treatment of [[sleep disorder]]s or to keep track of dreams had in order to gain insight to the subconscious or for other further contemplating.\n\n===''Tagebuch''===\nThe [[German language|German]] ''Tagebuch'' (\"days-book\") is normally rendered as \"diary\" in English, but the term encompasses workbooks or working journals as well as diaries proper.<ref>Cf.

One of the earliest printed fictional diaries was the humorous ''[[Diary of a Nobody]]'' by [[George Grossmith]] and his brother Weedon. 20th-century examples include radio broadcasts (e.g. ''[[Mrs. Dale's Diary]]'') and published books (e.g. the ''Diaries of [[Adrian Mole]]''). Both prompted long-running [[satire|satirical]] features in the magazine ''[[Private Eye]]'': the former entitled ''[[Mrs Wilson's Diary]]'' in reference to [[Mary Wilson, Baroness Wilson of Rievaulx|Mary Wilson]], wife of [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom|Prime Minister]] [[Harold Wilson]], the latter entitled \"The Secret Diary of John Major Aged 47\u00be\" and written as a pastiche of the [[Adrian Mole]] diaries from the perspective of the then-Prime Minister [[John Major]]. Another famous example of fictional diaries as prose is Bram Stoker's ''[[Dracula]]''. A modern example includes the [[Diary of a Wimpy Kid series|''Diary of a Wimpy Kid'' series]] where each book of the series is written in a first-person view of the main character, as if the book were an actual diary. Other examples are the ''[[Bert Diaries]]'' and the cellphone diaries in the Japanese [[manga]] and [[anime]] television series ''[[Future Diary]]''.\n\n==See also==\n{{columns-list|colwidth=20em|\n* [[Art diary]]\n* [[Autobiography]]\n* [[Automatic indexing]]\n* [[Coloring diary]]\n* [[Commentarii]]\n* [[Commonplace book]]\n* [[Diary studies]]\n* [[Electronic organizer]]\n* [[Fake memoirs]]\n* [[Hipster PDA]]\n* [[Journal (disambiguation)|Journal]]\n* [[List of books on diaries and journals]]\n* [[List of diarists]]\n* [[List of dream diaries]]\n* [[List of fictional diaries]]\n* [[Nikki bungaku]] / [[Poetic diary]]\n* [[Personal knowledge base]]\n* [[:Category:Diaries]]\n* [[:Category:Diarists]]\n}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==Further reading==\n* Ronald Blythe, ''The Pleasures of Diaries: Four Centuries of Private Writing'' (Pantheon, 1989, {{ISBN|0-394-58017-6}}) \u2014 the book contains selections from (mostly) English diarists' work.\n\n==External links==\n{{wikiquote}}\n{{wiktionary}}\n{{wiktionary|diarist}}\n* [http://www.makeuseof.com/tag/the-beginners-guide-to-digital-journaling/ The Beginner\u2019s Guide to Digital Journaling]\n* [https://doodlecollection.com/ Doodle Diaries]\n* [https://www.coloringdiary.com/ Coloring Diaries]\n* ''[https://www.archives.gov.on.ca/en/explore/online/diaries/index.aspx A Lifetime - Day by Day: Five Women and their Diaries]'', online exhibit on Archives of Ontario website\n\n\n{{Authority control}}\n\n[[Category:Diaries| ]]\n[[Category:Works about history]]\n", "name_user": "Nbarth", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200etop:dab", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diary"}
