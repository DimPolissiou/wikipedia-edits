At this meeting, the seven signed over what they believed was the authority of the Government of D\u00e1il \u00c9ireann to the Army Council. Henceforth, the IRA Army Council perceived itself to be the legitimate government of the [[Irish Republic]] and, on this basis, the IRA and Sinn F\u00e9in justified their rejection of the states of the [[Republic of Ireland]] and [[Northern Ireland]] and political [[abstentionism]] from their parliamentary institutions.\n\nToday, the dissident terrorist organisation [[Continuity Irish Republican Army|Continuity IRA]] claim to be the heirs of this legitimacy and believe to be the legitimate continuation of the original [[Irish Republican Army (1917\u201322)|Irish Republican Army]] or ''\u00d3glaigh na h\u00c9ireann''.<ref>{{cite book | last = van Engeland | first = Anisseh | authorlink = | title = From Terrorism to Politics (Ethics and Global Politics) | publisher = [[Ashgate Publishing]] | year = 2008 | page = 55 | doi =  | isbn = 978-0-7546-4990-8}}</ref>\n\n==Later life==\n\nFrom the late 1920s he ran a successful business publishing greeting cards, calendars and devotional materials decorated with Celtic designs and O'Higgins' own verses.\n\nFollowing the suppression of [[An Phoblacht]] in 1937, he founded and edited the [[Wolfe Tone Weekly]] from 1937\u20131939 until it was also banned by the Free State Government. From 1932 to 1962 he published the [[Wolfe Tone Annual]], from his business at 56 Parnell Square, Dublin. This popular series of volumes gave popular accounts of episodes in Irish history from a republican viewpoint and he intended to cheer and inspire those true to 'the Separatist Idea and devoted to the vindication of all those who have sacrificed themselves for the full Independence and Gaelicisation of Ireland'. O'Higgins wrote numerous ballads and poems about Ireland throughout his life time. Many are still sung at Feiseanna and Fleadh Ceoils.\n\nHe was a devout Catholic and was heavily critical of those who tried to link the Republican struggle with socialism and communism. Several of his children became Catholic priests.\n\n==Death==\n\nO'Higgins died while praying in Saint Anthony's Church in Clontarf, on 10 March 1963 <ref name=brianofbanbha>{{cite web |url=https://brianofbanba.wordpress.com/2018/05/10/brian-ohiggins-an-uncompromising-patriot/ |language=English |title=Brian O\u2019Higgins \u2013 An Uncompromising Patriot |work=brianofbanba.wordpress.com}}</ref>.

From 1932 to 1962 he published the [[Wolfe Tone Annual]], from his business at 56 Parnell Square, Dublin. This popular series of volumes gave popular accounts of episodes in Irish history from a republican viewpoint and he intended to cheer and inspire those true to 'the Separatist Idea and devoted to the vindication of all those who have sacrificed themselves for the full Independence and Gaelicisation of Ireland'. O'Higgins wrote numerous ballads and poems about Ireland throughout his life time. Many are still sung at Feiseanna and Fleadh Ceoils.\n\nHe was a devout Catholic and was heavily critical of those who tried to link the Republican struggle with socialism and communism.

Her later unfinished novel, ''[[Maria: or, The Wrongs of Woman|Maria, or the Wrongs of Woman]]'', earned her considerable criticism as she discussed women's sexual desires. She died young, and her widower, the philosopher [[William Godwin]], quickly wrote [[Memoirs of the Author of A Vindication of the Rights of Woman|a memoir of her]] that, contrary to his intentions, destroyed her reputation for generations.\n\nWollstonecraft is regarded as the \"fore-mother\" of [[Feminist history in the United Kingdom|the British feminist movement]] and her ideas shaped the thinking of the [[suffragette]]s, who campaigned for the women's vote.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Tauchert|first1=Ashley|title=Mary Wollstonecraft and the Accent of the Feminine|date=2002|publisher=Palgrave|location=New York|isbn=9780230287358|page=5}}</ref>\n\n=== Early American efforts ===\n\nEarly Feminism was directly correlated with the [[abolitionist movement]]s and as a result many famous feminists and activists began to have their voices heard.

[[Tagea Brandt]] was also part of this movement, and in her honor was established the [[Tagea Brandt Rejselegat]] or Travel Scholarship for women. The Dansk Kvindesamfund's efforts as a leading group of women for women led to the existence of the revised Danish constitution of 1915, giving women the right to vote and the provision of equal opportunity laws during the 1920s, which influenced the present-day legislative measures to grant women access to education, work, marital rights and other obligations.<ref name=KV1>{{cite web|last=Larsen|first=Jytte|title=The women's movement in Denmark|url=http://www.kvinfo.dk/side/680/article/3/|work=Translated by Gaye Kynoch|publisher=[[KVINFO]]|accessdate=17 November 2013}}</ref>\n\n== New Zealand ==\nEarly New Zealand feminists and suffragettes included [[Maud Pember Reeves]] (Australian-born; later lived in London), [[Kate Sheppard]] and [[Mary Ann M\u00fcller]].

Early university graduates were [[Emily Siedeberg]] (doctor, graduated 1895) and [[Ethel Benjamin]] (lawyer, graduated 1897).

In the second half of the nineteenth century many initiatives by feminists sprung up in The Netherlands. [[Aletta Jacobs]] (1854\u20131929) requested and obtained as the first woman in the Netherlands the right to study at university in 1871, becoming the first female medical doctor and academic. She became a lifelong campaigner for [[women's suffrage]], equal rights, birth control, and international peace, travelling worldwide for, e.g., the [[International Alliance of Women]]. [[Wilhelmina Drucker]] (1847\u20131925) was a politician, a prolific writer and a peace activist, who fought for the vote and equal rights through political and feminist organisations she founded.

The first person to hold public speeches and agitate in favor of feminism was [[Sophie Sager]] in 1848,<ref>[[Gunhild Kyle|Kyle, Gunhild]]; Krusenstjerna, Eva von (1993). Kvinnoprofiler. Panorama ([[Natur & Kultur]]), 99-0913791-7.

The two foremost questions was to abolish [[coverture]] for unmarried women, and for the state to provide women an equivalent to a university. Both questions were met: in 1858, a reform granted unmarried women the right to apply for legal majority by a simple procedure, and in 1861, [[H\u00f6gre l\u00e4rarinneseminariet]] was founded as a \"Women's University\". In 1859, the first [[women's magazine]] in Sweden and the Nordic countries, the ''[[Tidskrift f\u00f6r hemmet]]'', was founded by [[Sophie Adlersparre]] and [[Rosalie Olivecrona]]. This has been referred to as the starting point of a women's movement in Sweden.\n\nThe organized women's movement begun in 1873, when [[Married Woman's Property Rights Association]] was co-founded by [[Anna Hierta-Retzius]] and [[Ellen Anckarsv\u00e4rd]]. The prime task of the organization was to abolish [[coverture]]. In 1884, [[Fredrika Bremer Association]] was founded by [[Sophie Adlersparre]] to work for the improvement in women's rights. The second half of the 19th century saw the creation of several women's rights organisations and a considerable activity within both active organization as well as intellectual debate. The 1880s saw the so-called ''[[Sedlighetsdebatten]]'', were gender roles were discussed in literary debate in regards to sexual double standards in opposed to sexual equality. In 1902, finally, the [[National Association for Women's Suffrage (Sweden)|National Association for Women's Suffrage]] was founded.\n\nIn 1921, [[women's suffrage]] was finally introduced. The women suffrage reform was followed by the ''Beh\u00f6righetslagen'' of 1923 (Act of Access of 1923), in which males and females were formally given equal access to all professions and positions in society, the only exceptions being military and priesthood positions.<ref>Lilla Focus Uppslagsbok (1979)</ref> The last two restrictions were removed in 1958, when women were allowed to become priests, and in a series of reforms between 1980 and 1989, when all military professions were opened to women.<ref>Sundevall, Fia (2011).

October 31, 1971 Swiss women were granted the right to vote in political elections. According to Lee Ann Banaszak the main reasons for lack of success in women\u2019s suffrage for Swiss women was due to the differences in mobilization of members into suffrage organizations, financial resources of the suffrage movements, alliances formed with other political actors, and the characteristics of the political systems. Therefore the success of the Swiss women\u2019s suffrage movement was heavily affected by the resources and political structures. \u201cThe Swiss movement had to operate in a system where decisions were made carefully by a constructed consensus and where opposition parties never launched an electoral challenge that might of prodded governing parties into action.\u201d This explains how the closed legislative process made it way more difficult for suffrage activists to participate in, or even track women\u2019s voting rights. Swiss suffrage also lacked strong allies when it came from their struggle to vote in political elections.<ref>{{Cite journal|date=1997-12|title=Lee Ann Banaszak. <italic>Why Movements Succeed or Fail: Opportunity, Culture, and the Struggle for Woman Suffrage</italic>.

In the beginning of the 20th century, women's employment was still predominantly limited to factory labor and domestic work. During [[World War I]], more women found work outside the home. As a result of the wartime experience of women in the workforce, the ''[[Sex Disqualification (Removal) Act 1919]]'' opened professions and the civil service to women, and marriage was no longer a legal barrier to women working outside the home.\n\nIn 1918 [[Marie Stopes]] published the very influential ''[[Married Love]]'',<ref name=\"google2004\">{{cite book|last=Stopes |first=Marie Carmichael |editor-last=McKibbin |editor-first=Ross |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=M13Q0aymFJoC|title=Married Love|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-280432-7|year=2004|orig-year=1918}}</ref> in which she advocated [[gender equality]] in marriage and the importance of women's sexual desire.

In 1928, the franchise was extended to all women over 21 by the ''[[Representation of the People (Equal Franchise) Act 1928]]'', on an equal basis to men.<ref>{{cite book |author=Phillips, Melanie |title=The Ascent of Woman: A History of the Suffragette Movement and the Ideas Behind It |year=2004 |publisher=Abacus |location=London |isbn=978-0-349-11660-0}}</ref>\n\nMany feminist writers and women's rights activists argued that it was not equality to men which they needed but a recognition of what women need to fulfill their potential of their own natures, not only within the aspect of work but society and home life too. [[Virginia Woolf]] produced her essay ''[[A Room of One's Own]]'' based on the ideas of women as writers and characters in fiction. Woolf said that a woman must have money and a room of her own to be able to write.\n\n== Education: ==\nEducation amongst young Swiss women was very important during the suffrage movements. Educating young women in society on the importance of self-identity, and going to school was very important to the public and for women to realize what their full potentials were. The Swiss suffrage movements believed it was important for young women to know that there was more to their life than just bearing children, which was a very universal thought and action during the suffrage movements in the 1960s and 70s. In a 2015 evaluation from Lord David Willetts he had discovered and stated that in 2013, the percentage of undergraduate students in the UK were 54 percent females and 46 percent were male undergrads. Whereas in the 1960s only 25 percent of full-time students in the United Kingdom were females. The increase of females going to school and contributing in the educational system can be linked to the women\u2019s suffrage movements that aimed to encourage women to enroll in school for higher education.<ref>{{Cite book|last=David|first=Miriam E.|url=http://www.jstor.org/stable/10.2307/j.ctt1t89279|title=Reclaiming feminism: Challenging everyday misogyny|date=2016-06-15|publisher=Bristol University Press|isbn=978-1-4473-2818-6|edition=1|doi=10.2307/j.ctt1t89279.7.}}</ref> This right and political affair eventually came after the right for women to vote in political elections which was granted in 1971.

The majority of first-wave feminists were more moderate and conservative than radical or revolutionary\u2014like the members of the [[American Woman Suffrage Association]] (AWSA) they were willing to work within the political system and they understood the clout of joining with sympathetic men in power to promote the cause of suffrage. The limited membership of the NWSA was narrowly focused on gaining a federal amendment for women's suffrage, whereas the AWSA, with ten times as many members, worked to gain suffrage on a state-by-state level as a necessary precursor to federal suffrage. The NWSA had broad goals, hoping to achieve a more equal social role for women, but the AWSA was aware of the divisive nature of many of those goals and instead chose to focus solely on suffrage. The NWSA was known for having more publicly aggressive tactics (such as picketing and hunger strikes) whereas the AWSA used more traditional strategies like lobbying, delivering speeches, applying political pressure and gathering signatures for petitions.<ref>Dicker, 2008, pp. 40\u201343.</ref>\n\nDuring the first wave, there was a notable connection between the slavery abolition movement and the women's rights movement. Frederick Douglass was heavily involved in both movements and believed that it was essential for both to work together in order to attain true equality in regards to race and sex.<ref>Rojas.

This was the major victory of the movement, which also included reforms in [[higher education]], in the workplace and professions, and in health care.\nWomen started serving on school boards and local bodies, and numbers kept increasing. This period also saw more women gaining access to higher education.

All states have a legislative branch which enacts state statutes, an executive branch that promulgates state regulations pursuant to statutory authorization, and a judicial branch that applies, interprets, and occasionally overturns both state statutes and regulations, as well as local ordinances. States retain plenary power to make laws covering anything not preempted by the federal Constitution, federal statutes, or international treaties ratified by the federal Senate. Normally, [[State supreme court|state supreme courts]] are the final interpreters of state institutions and state law, unless their interpretation itself presents a federal issue, in which case a decision may be appealed to the [[Supreme Court of the United States|U.S. Supreme Court]] by way of a petition for writ of [[certiorari]].<ref>See {{UnitedStatesCode|28|1257}}.</ref> State laws have dramatically diverged in the centuries since independence, to the extent that the United States cannot be regarded as one legal system as to the majority of types of law traditionally under state control, but must be regarded as 50 ''separate'' systems of [[tort law]], [[family law]], [[property law]], [[contract law]], [[criminal law]], and so on.<ref name=\"Olson 1999 6\">{{cite book|title=Legal Information: How to Find It, How to Use It|last=Olson|first=Kent C.|publisher=Greenwood Publishing Group|year=1999|isbn=978-0897749633|location=Phoenix|pages=[https://archive.org/details/legalinformation00kent/page/6 6]|url=https://archive.org/details/legalinformation00kent/page/6}}</ref>\n\nMarylynn Salmon argues that each state developed different ways of dealing with a variety of legal issues pertaining to women, especially in the case of property laws.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Women and the Law of Property in Early America|last=Salmon|first=Marylynn|publisher=UNC Press|year=2016|isbn=9781469620442|location=|pages=|chapter=Diversity in American Law}}</ref> In 1809, [[Connecticut]] was the first state to pass a law allowing women to write wills.\n\n1860, New York passed a revised [[Married Women's Property Acts in the United States|Married Women's Property Act]] which gave women shared ownership of their children, allowing them to have a say in their children's wills, wages, and granting them the right to inherit property.<ref name=\"Dicker, 2008, pp. 30, 38\">Dicker, 2008, pp. 30, 38.</ref> Further advances and setbacks were experienced in New York and other states, but with each new win the feminists were able to use it as an example to apply more leverage on unyielding legislative bodies.\n\n=== White Feminism: The Absent Contributions by Black  Feminists ===\nFirst Wave Feminism in the United States did not chronicle the contributions of Black women to the same degree as White women. Activists, including Susan B. Anthony and other feminist leaders preached for equality between genders; however, they disregarded equality between a number of other issues, including race. This allowed for White women to gain power and equality relative to White men, while the social disparity between White and Black women increased. The exclusion aided the growing prevalence of White supremacy, specifically White feminism while actively overlooking the severity of impact Black feminists had on the movement.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Charles|first=Monique|date=2018-04-01|title=Grime Labour|journal=Soundings|volume=68|issue=68|pages=40\u201352|doi=10.3898/136266218822845673|issn=1362-6620}}</ref><ref name=\"Dill 1983 131\">{{Cite journal|last=Dill|first=Bonnie Thornton|date=1983|title=Race, Class, and Gender: Prospects for an All-Inclusive Sisterhood|journal=Feminist Studies|volume=9|issue=1|pages=131\u2013150|doi=10.2307/3177687|issn=0046-3663|jstor=3177687}}</ref>\n\n==== Two Different Fights ====\nThe two different fights for Black and White women's equality were present simultaneously and could not be separated during the First Wave of Feminism. White women were fighting for rights equal to White men in society. They wanted to correct the discrepancy in education, professional, property, economic, and voting rights. They also fought for birth control and abortion freedom. Black women, on the other hand, were ultimately fighting two \u201c-isms\u201d, racism and sexism, contributing to an uphill struggle for Black feminists. While White women could not vote, Black women ''and'' men could not vote. [[Mary Garrett|Mary J.

The father of the Enlightenment defined an ideal democratic society that was based on the equality of men, where women were often discriminated against. The inherent exclusion of women from discussion was addressed by both Wollstonecraft, and her contemporaries.  Wollstonecraft based her work on the ideas of Rousseau.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Reuter|first=Martina|year=2017|title=Jean-Jacques Rousseau and Mary Wollstonecraft on the imagination|doi=10.1080/09608788.2017.1334188|journal=British Journal for the History of Philosophy|volume=25|issue=6|pages=1138\u20131160}}</ref> Although at first it seems to be contradictory, Wollstonecraft's idea was to expand Rousseau's democratic society but based on [[gender equality]].\n\nWollstonecraft published one of the first feminist treatises, ''[[A Vindication of the Rights of Woman]]'' (1792), in which she advocated the social and moral equality of the sexes, extending the work of her 1790 pamphlet, ''[[A Vindication of the Rights of Men]]''. Her later unfinished novel, ''[[Maria: or, The Wrongs of Woman|Maria, or the Wrongs of Woman]]'', earned her considerable criticism as she discussed women's sexual desires. She died young, and her widower, the philosopher [[William Godwin]], quickly wrote [[Memoirs of the Author of A Vindication of the Rights of Woman|a memoir of her]] that, contrary to his intentions, destroyed her reputation for generations.\n\nWollstonecraft is regarded as the \"fore-mother\" of [[Feminist history in the United Kingdom|the British feminist movement]] and her ideas shaped the thinking of the [[suffragette]]s, who campaigned for the women's vote.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Tauchert|first1=Ashley|title=Mary Wollstonecraft and the Accent of the Feminine|date=2002|publisher=Palgrave|location=New York|isbn=9780230287358|page=5}}</ref>\n\n=== Early American efforts ===\n\nEarly Feminism was directly correlated with the [[abolitionist movement]]s and as a result many famous feminists and activists began to have their voices heard.

Through these meetings, she became well known amongst politicians, judges, philanthropists, writers and poets. In 1889, she helped to found the Women's Literary Society, which later grew into the [[Women's Suffrage League|Womanhood Suffrage League]] in 1891. Leading politicians hosted by Scott included [[Bernhard Wise]], [[William Holman]], [[William Morris Hughes]] and [[Thomas Bavin]], who met and discussed the drafting of the bill that eventually became the Early Closing Act of 1899.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/num_act/eca1899n38176.pdf |title=Early Closing Act 1899 No 38 |accessdate=2012-09-28}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Tribute to the Suffragettes, close up.jpg|thumb|right|''Tribute to the Suffragettes'' memorial in [[Christchurch]], New Zealand.

[[Line Luplau]] was one of the most notable woman in this era. [[Tagea Brandt]] was also part of this movement, and in her honor was established the [[Tagea Brandt Rejselegat]] or Travel Scholarship for women. The Dansk Kvindesamfund's efforts as a leading group of women for women led to the existence of the revised Danish constitution of 1915, giving women the right to vote and the provision of equal opportunity laws during the 1920s, which influenced the present-day legislative measures to grant women access to education, work, marital rights and other obligations.<ref name=KV1>{{cite web|last=Larsen|first=Jytte|title=The women's movement in Denmark|url=http://www.kvinfo.dk/side/680/article/3/|work=Translated by Gaye Kynoch|publisher=[[KVINFO]]|accessdate=17 November 2013}}</ref>\n\n== New Zealand ==\nEarly New Zealand feminists and suffragettes included [[Maud Pember Reeves]] (Australian-born; later lived in London), [[Kate Sheppard]] and [[Mary Ann M\u00fcller]].

Early university graduates were [[Emily Siedeberg]] (doctor, graduated 1895) and [[Ethel Benjamin]] (lawyer, graduated 1897). The Female Law Practitioners Act was passed in 1896 and Benjamin was admitted as a barrister and solicitor of the Supreme Court of New Zealand in 1897 (see [[Women's suffrage in New Zealand]]).\n\n==Netherlands==\n[[File:Wilhelmina Drucker IMG0020.tif|thumb|In the Netherlands, [[Wilhelmina Drucker]] (1847\u20131925) fought successfully for the vote and equal rights for women through political and feminist organisations she founded.]]\n<!-- [[File:Aletta Jacobs door Isaac Israels 1920.jpg|thumb|Isaac Israels: Aletta Jacobs, 1920.

In the second half of the nineteenth century many initiatives by feminists sprung up in The Netherlands. [[Aletta Jacobs]] (1854\u20131929) requested and obtained as the first woman in the Netherlands the right to study at university in 1871, becoming the first female medical doctor and academic. She became a lifelong campaigner for [[women's suffrage]], equal rights, birth control, and international peace, travelling worldwide for, e.g., the [[International Alliance of Women]]. [[Wilhelmina Drucker]] (1847\u20131925) was a politician, a prolific writer and a peace activist, who fought for the vote and equal rights through political and feminist organisations she founded. In 1917\u20131919 her goal of women's suffrage was reached.

The first person to hold public speeches and agitate in favor of feminism was [[Sophie Sager]] in 1848,<ref>[[Gunhild Kyle|Kyle, Gunhild]]; Krusenstjerna, Eva von (1993). Kvinnoprofiler.

The two foremost questions was to abolish [[coverture]] for unmarried women, and for the state to provide women an equivalent to a university. Both questions were met: in 1858, a reform granted unmarried women the right to apply for legal majority by a simple procedure, and in 1861, [[H\u00f6gre l\u00e4rarinneseminariet]] was founded as a \"Women's University\". In 1859, the first [[women's magazine]] in Sweden and the Nordic countries, the ''[[Tidskrift f\u00f6r hemmet]]'', was founded by [[Sophie Adlersparre]] and [[Rosalie Olivecrona]]. This has been referred to as the starting point of a women's movement in Sweden.\n\nThe organized women's movement begun in 1873, when [[Married Woman's Property Rights Association]] was co-founded by [[Anna Hierta-Retzius]] and [[Ellen Anckarsv\u00e4rd]]. The prime task of the organization was to abolish [[coverture]]. In 1884, [[Fredrika Bremer Association]] was founded by [[Sophie Adlersparre]] to work for the improvement in women's rights. The second half of the 19th century saw the creation of several women's rights organisations and a considerable activity within both active organization as well as intellectual debate. The 1880s saw the so-called ''[[Sedlighetsdebatten]]'', were gender roles were discussed in literary debate in regards to sexual double standards in opposed to sexual equality. In 1902, finally, the [[National Association for Women's Suffrage (Sweden)|National Association for Women's Suffrage]] was founded.\n\nIn 1921, [[women's suffrage]] was finally introduced. The women suffrage reform was followed by the ''Beh\u00f6righetslagen'' of 1923 (Act of Access of 1923), in which males and females were formally given equal access to all professions and positions in society, the only exceptions being military and priesthood positions.<ref>Lilla Focus Uppslagsbok (1979)</ref> The last two restrictions were removed in 1958, when women were allowed to become priests, and in a series of reforms between 1980 and 1989, when all military professions were opened to women.<ref>Sundevall, Fia (2011).

October 31, 1971 Swiss women were granted the right to vote in political elections. According to Lee Ann Banaszak the main reasons for lack of success in women\u2019s suffrage for Swiss women was due to the differences in mobilization of members into suffrage organizations, financial resources of the suffrage movements, alliances formed with other political actors, and the characteristics of the political systems. Therefore the success of the Swiss women\u2019s suffrage movement was heavily affected by the resources and political structures. \u201cThe Swiss movement had to operate in a system where decisions were made carefully by a constructed consensus and where opposition parties never launched an electoral challenge that might of prodded governing parties into action.\u201d This explains how the closed legislative process made it way more difficult for suffrage activists to participate in, or even track women\u2019s voting rights. Swiss suffrage also lacked strong allies when it came from their struggle to vote in political elections.<ref>{{Cite journal|date=1997-12|title=Lee Ann Banaszak. <italic>Why Movements Succeed or Fail: Opportunity, Culture, and the Struggle for Woman Suffrage</italic>.

This included individuals such as [[Caroline Norton]] whose personal tragedy where she was unable to obtain a divorce and was denied access to her three sons by her husband, led her to a life of intense campaigning which successfully led to the passing of the [[Custody of Infants Act 1839]] and the introduction of the [[Tender years doctrine]] for child custody arrangement.<ref>{{cite book|last=Wroath|first=John|title=Until They Are Seven, The Origins of Women's Legal Rights|year=1998|publisher=Waterside Press|isbn=1-872-870-57-0|url=https://archive.org/details/untiltheyareseve00wroa}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|last=Mitchell|first=L.G.|title=Lord Melbourne, 1779\u20131848|year=1997|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|last=Perkins|first=Jane Gray|url=https://archive.org/details/bub_gb_FJBpAAAAMAAJ|title=The Life of the Honourable Mrs. Norton|year=1909|publisher=John Murray|isbn=}}</ref> The Act gave married women, for the first time, a right to their children.

The journal continued publication until 1864 and was succeeded in 1866 by the ''[[Englishwoman's Review]]'' edited until 1880 by [[Jessie Boucherett]] which continued publication until 1910. Jessie Boucherett and [[Adelaide Anne Proctor]] joined the Langham Place Circle in 1859. The group was active until 1866.

In the beginning of the 20th century, women's employment was still predominantly limited to factory labor and domestic work. During [[World War I]], more women found work outside the home. As a result of the wartime experience of women in the workforce, the ''[[Sex Disqualification (Removal) Act 1919]]'' opened professions and the civil service to women, and marriage was no longer a legal barrier to women working outside the home.\n\nIn 1918 [[Marie Stopes]] published the very influential ''[[Married Love]]'',<ref name=\"google2004\">{{cite book|last=Stopes |first=Marie Carmichael |editor-last=McKibbin |editor-first=Ross |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=M13Q0aymFJoC|title=Married Love|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-280432-7|year=2004|orig-year=1918}}</ref> in which she advocated [[gender equality]] in marriage and the importance of women's sexual desire. (Importation of the book into the United States was banned as obscene until 1931.)\n\nThe ''[[Representation of the People Act 1918]]'' extended the franchise to women who were at least 30 years old and they or their husbands were property holders, while the ''[[Parliament (Qualification of Women) Act 1918]]'' gave women the right to sit in Parliament, although it was only slowly that women were actually elected. In 1928, the franchise was extended to all women over 21 by the ''[[Representation of the People (Equal Franchise) Act 1928]]'', on an equal basis to men.<ref>{{cite book |author=Phillips, Melanie |title=The Ascent of Woman: A History of the Suffragette Movement and the Ideas Behind It |year=2004 |publisher=Abacus |location=London |isbn=978-0-349-11660-0}}</ref>\n\nMany feminist writers and women's rights activists argued that it was not equality to men which they needed but a recognition of what women need to fulfill their potential of their own natures, not only within the aspect of work but society and home life too. [[Virginia Woolf]] produced her essay ''[[A Room of One's Own]]'' based on the ideas of women as writers and characters in fiction. Woolf said that a woman must have money and a room of her own to be able to write.\n\n== Education: ==\nEducation amongst young Swiss women was very important during the suffrage movements. Educating young women in society on the importance of self-identity, and going to school was very important to the public and for women to realize what their full potentials were. The Swiss suffrage movements believed it was important for young women to know that there was more to their life than just bearing children, which was a very universal thought and action during the suffrage movements in the 1960s and 70s. In a 2015 evaluation from Lord David Willetts he had discovered and stated that in 2013, the percentage of undergraduate students in the UK were 54 percent females and 46 percent were male undergrads. Whereas in the 1960s only 25 percent of full-time students in the United Kingdom were females. The increase of females going to school and contributing in the educational system can be linked to the women\u2019s suffrage movements that aimed to encourage women to enroll in school for higher education.<ref>{{Cite book|last=David|first=Miriam E.|url=http://www.jstor.org/stable/10.2307/j.ctt1t89279|title=Reclaiming feminism: Challenging everyday misogyny|date=2016-06-15|publisher=Bristol University Press|isbn=978-1-4473-2818-6|edition=1|doi=10.2307/j.ctt1t89279.7.}}</ref> This right and political affair eventually came after the right for women to vote in political elections which was granted in 1971.

Other important leaders included several women who dissented against the law in order to have their voices heard, ([[Grimk\u00e9 sisters|Sarah and Angelina Grimk\u00e9]]), in addition to other activists such as [[Carrie Chapman Catt]], [[Alice Paul]], [[Sojourner Truth]], [[Ida B. Wells]], [[Margaret Sanger]] and [[Lucy Burns]].<ref>Dicker, 2008. pp. 28, 47\u201348.</ref>\n\nFirst-wave feminism involved a wide range of women, some belonging to [[Christian right|conservative Christian]] groups (such as [[Frances Willard (suffragist)|Frances Willard]] and the [[Woman's Christian Temperance Union]]), others such as [[Matilda Joslyn Gage]] of the [[National Woman Suffrage Association]] (NWSA) resembling the radicalism of much of [[second-wave feminism]]. The majority of first-wave feminists were more moderate and conservative than radical or revolutionary\u2014like the members of the [[American Woman Suffrage Association]] (AWSA) they were willing to work within the political system and they understood the clout of joining with sympathetic men in power to promote the cause of suffrage. The limited membership of the NWSA was narrowly focused on gaining a federal amendment for women's suffrage, whereas the AWSA, with ten times as many members, worked to gain suffrage on a state-by-state level as a necessary precursor to federal suffrage. The NWSA had broad goals, hoping to achieve a more equal social role for women, but the AWSA was aware of the divisive nature of many of those goals and instead chose to focus solely on suffrage. The NWSA was known for having more publicly aggressive tactics (such as picketing and hunger strikes) whereas the AWSA used more traditional strategies like lobbying, delivering speeches, applying political pressure and gathering signatures for petitions.<ref>Dicker, 2008, pp. 40\u201343.</ref>\n\nDuring the first wave, there was a notable connection between the slavery abolition movement and the women's rights movement. Frederick Douglass was heavily involved in both movements and believed that it was essential for both to work together in order to attain true equality in regards to race and sex.<ref>Rojas.

This was the major victory of the movement, which also included reforms in [[higher education]], in the workplace and professions, and in health care.\nWomen started serving on school boards and local bodies, and numbers kept increasing. This period also saw more women gaining access to higher education. In 1910, \"women were attending many leading medical schools, and in 1915 the American Medical Association began to admit women members.\"<ref name=\"autogenerated1995\">[http://www.wic.org/misc/history.htm \"Women's History in America\"], Excerpted from Compton's Interactive Encyclopedia, 1995</ref> A ''Matrimonial Causes Act 1923'' gave women the right to the same grounds for divorce as men. The first wave of feminists, in contrast to the second wave, focused very little on the subjects of abortion, birth control, and overall reproductive rights of women.

All states have a legislative branch which enacts state statutes, an executive branch that promulgates state regulations pursuant to statutory authorization, and a judicial branch that applies, interprets, and occasionally overturns both state statutes and regulations, as well as local ordinances. States retain plenary power to make laws covering anything not preempted by the federal Constitution, federal statutes, or international treaties ratified by the federal Senate. Normally, [[State supreme court|state supreme courts]] are the final interpreters of state institutions and state law, unless their interpretation itself presents a federal issue, in which case a decision may be appealed to the [[Supreme Court of the United States|U.S. Supreme Court]] by way of a petition for writ of [[certiorari]].<ref>See {{UnitedStatesCode|28|1257}}.</ref> State laws have dramatically diverged in the centuries since independence, to the extent that the United States cannot be regarded as one legal system as to the majority of types of law traditionally under state control, but must be regarded as 50 ''separate'' systems of [[tort law]], [[family law]], [[property law]], [[contract law]], [[criminal law]], and so on.<ref name=\"Olson 1999 6\">{{cite book|title=Legal Information: How to Find It, How to Use It|last=Olson|first=Kent C.|publisher=Greenwood Publishing Group|year=1999|isbn=978-0897749633|location=Phoenix|pages=[https://archive.org/details/legalinformation00kent/page/6 6]|url=https://archive.org/details/legalinformation00kent/page/6}}</ref>\n\nMarylynn Salmon argues that each state developed different ways of dealing with a variety of legal issues pertaining to women, especially in the case of property laws.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Women and the Law of Property in Early America|last=Salmon|first=Marylynn|publisher=UNC Press|year=2016|isbn=9781469620442|location=|pages=|chapter=Diversity in American Law}}</ref> In 1809, [[Connecticut]] was the first state to pass a law allowing women to write wills.\n\n1860, New York passed a revised [[Married Women's Property Acts in the United States|Married Women's Property Act]] which gave women shared ownership of their children, allowing them to have a say in their children's wills, wages, and granting them the right to inherit property.<ref name=\"Dicker, 2008, pp. 30, 38\">Dicker, 2008, pp. 30, 38.</ref> Further advances and setbacks were experienced in New York and other states, but with each new win the feminists were able to use it as an example to apply more leverage on unyielding legislative bodies.\n\n=== White Feminism: The Absent Contributions by Black  Feminists ===\nFirst Wave Feminism in the United States did not chronicle the contributions of Black women to the same degree as White women. Activists, including Susan B. Anthony and other feminist leaders preached for equality between genders; however, they disregarded equality between a number of other issues, including race. This allowed for White women to gain power and equality relative to White men, while the social disparity between White and Black women increased. The exclusion aided the growing prevalence of White supremacy, specifically White feminism while actively overlooking the severity of impact Black feminists had on the movement.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Charles|first=Monique|date=2018-04-01|title=Grime Labour|journal=Soundings|volume=68|issue=68|pages=40\u201352|doi=10.3898/136266218822845673|issn=1362-6620}}</ref><ref name=\"Dill 1983 131\">{{Cite journal|last=Dill|first=Bonnie Thornton|date=1983|title=Race, Class, and Gender: Prospects for an All-Inclusive Sisterhood|journal=Feminist Studies|volume=9|issue=1|pages=131\u2013150|doi=10.2307/3177687|issn=0046-3663|jstor=3177687}}</ref>\n\n==== Two Different Fights ====\nThe two different fights for Black and White women's equality were present simultaneously and could not be separated during the First Wave of Feminism. White women were fighting for rights equal to White men in society. They wanted to correct the discrepancy in education, professional, property, economic, and voting rights. They also fought for birth control and abortion freedom. Black women, on the other hand, were ultimately fighting two \u201c-isms\u201d, racism and sexism, contributing to an uphill struggle for Black feminists. While White women could not vote, Black women ''and'' men could not vote. [[Mary Garrett|Mary J.

In 1851 she delivered her \u201cAin\u2019t I a Woman\u201d speech at the women's rights convention in Akron, Ohio. Black women at this point were beginning to become empowered and assertive, speaking out on the disproportionate inequalities. Truth speaks of how she, and other women, are capable of working as much as men, after having thirteen children. This speech was one of the ways White and Black women became closer to working towards fighting for the same thing. Another one of Truth's speeches at the [[American Equal Rights Association]] in New York in 1867 she said, \u201dIf colored men get their rights, and not colored women theirs, you see the colored men will be masters over the women, and it will be just as bad as it was before.\" <ref>{{Cite book|title=Truth, Sojourner (1799\u201326 November 1883), black abolitionist and women's rights advocate|volume = 1|last=Painter|first=Nell Irvin|date=February 2000|publisher=Oxford University Press|series=American National Biography Online|doi = 10.1093/anb/9780198606697.article.1500706}}</ref> Her speeches brought attention to the movement, for Black women, but also for White. Although private lives continued to be segregated, feminist coalitions became integrated. Two separate reasons aided integration in the feminist movement.

For Kyla Schuller in ''The Biopolitics of Feeling: Race, Sex, and Science in the Nineteenth Century'', \"biopower is feminism's enabling condition ... movements for gender equality have materialized amid a field of power in which, at least since Malthus, the interdependence of reproduction and economics forms the primary field of the political.\"<ref name=\":2\">{{Cite book|title=The Biopolitics of Feeling: Race, Sex, and Science in the Nineteenth Century|last=Schuller|first=Kyla|publisher=Duke University Press|year=2018|isbn=|location=|pages=}}</ref>  Schuller argues that \"[the] evolutionary notion of the distinct sexes of male and female, understood as specialized divergences in physiology, anatomy, and mental function that only the most civilized had achieved, was itself a  racial hierarchy ... the very idea of sex as a biological and political subjectivity is a product of the biopolitical logics unfolding hand in hand with the sciences of species change.\"<ref name=\":2\" />  Schuller quotes [[Canadians|Canadian]] philosopher [[Michelle Murphy]] in ''Seizing the Means of Reproduction: Entanglements of Feminism, Health, and Technoscience'': \"Historicizing feminisms as a biopolitics that has taken 'sex,' and its subsidiary, 'reproduction,' as central concerns requires that we understand feminisms in all their variety and contradiction as animated within - and not escaping from - dominant configurations of governance and technoscience.\"<ref name=\":2\" /> From this perspective, 19th- and early 20th-century feminisms reproduced the very social hierarchies they had the potential to struggle against, exemplifying the claim of [[Michel Foucault]] in his ''The History of Sexuality, Volume I: An Introduction'' that \"resistance is never in a position of exteriority in relation to power.\"<ref>{{Cite book|title=The History of Sexuality: Volume I: An Introduction|last=Foucault|first=Michel|publisher=Vintage Books [Random House, Inc.]|year=1990|isbn=|volume=1|location=New York|pages=95}}</ref>\n\nFirst-wave feminism offered no intersectional perspective.

British forces besieged and captured the city of [[Havana]], which at the time was an important [[Spanish Empire|Spanish]] naval base in the [[Caribbean]], and dealt a serious blow to the [[Spanish Navy]]. Havana was subsequently returned to Spain under the 1763 [[Treaty of Paris (1763)|Treaty of Paris]] that formally ended the war.\n\n==Background==\n{{main|Anglo-Spanish War (1762\u20131763)}}\nHavana in the late 18th century was a major port and naval base, and also the strongest fortress in Spanish America. Its royal shipyard with access to abundant supplies of resistant hardwoods was capable of building [[first-rate]] warships and had been developed by the Bourbon monarchy as the most important of its three naval shipyards.<ref name=\"Roger50\">Roger p. 50</ref><ref name=\"Schneider72-73\">Schneider pp. 72-73</ref> There had been several previous plans to attack Havana, including one proposed to [[Edward Vernon|Vernon]] in 1739, which he rejected in favour of an attack on  [[Battle of Porto Bello|Portobello]],<ref name=\"Bradley201\">Bradley p. 201</ref> but no successful attack since it was comprehensively fortified,<ref name=\"Schneider21\">Schneider p. 21</ref> and the strength of its fortifications and difficulty that large sailing warships would have in making an undetected approach from the north convinced the Spanish commanders it would be virtually impossible to capture, if its fortifications were in good order and it was properly garrisoned. Its wealth and ability to feed its population also suggested that it could resist being starved into surrender.<ref name=\"Roger50-51\">Roger pp. 50-51</ref><ref name=\"Schneider61,106\">Schneider pp. 61,106</ref>\n\nBritain had been formally at war with France since May 1756, but Spain under  [[Ferdinand VI of Spain|Ferdinand VI]] remained neutral. After Ferdinand's death on 1759, his half-brother  [[Charles III of Spain|Charles III]] reversed Ferdinand's policy and, by the [[Treaty of Paris (1761)]], re-established the so-called  [[Pacte de Famille|Family Compact]] between France and Spain. This treaty involved an offensive alliance directed against Britain, and in December 1761, Spain placed an  [[Economic sanctions|embargo]] on British trade, seized British goods and expelled British merchants. In response to this, Britain declared war on Spain in January 1762.<ref>Danley and Speelman pp. 431-432</ref>\n\n===Spanish preparations===\nBefore involving his country in the conflict raging in Europe and across the world, Charles III made provisions to defend the [[Spanish colonies]] against the [[British Royal Navy]]. For the defence of Cuba, he appointed [[Juan de Prado Mayera Portocarrero y Luna|Juan de Prado]] as commander-in-chief.  De Prado arrived at [[Havana]] in February 1761 and began work to improve the fortifications of the city.<ref name=\"Schneider82\">Schneider p. 82</ref>\n\nIn June 1761, a flotilla of seven [[ships of the line]] under the command of Admiral [[Gutierre de Hevia]] arrived at Havana, transporting two regular infantry regiments (Espa\u00f1a and Arag\u00f3n) totalling 996 men, bringing the Havana garrison to 2,400 regular infantry. There were also 6,300 sailors and marines aboard the ships.<ref>Greentree p. 15</ref> However, [[yellow fever]] had reduced the defending forces of the city by the time the siege began to 1,900 regular infantry, 750 marines, around 5,000 sailors and 2,000 to 3,000 armed militia, besides several thousand more without firearms or training.<ref>Greentree p. 20</ref> The main garrison consisted of:\n[[File:A plan of the Havana and its environs, with the several posts and attacks by Thomas Kitchin.jpg|thumb|left|300px|A plan of Havana and its environs in 1762, by [[Thomas Kitchen]]]]\n* Espa\u00f1a Infantry Regiment (481)\n* Arag\u00f3n Infantry Regiment (265)\n* Havana Infantry Regiment (856)\n* Edinburgh's Dragoons (150)\n* Army's gunners (104)\n* Navy's gunners and marines (750)\n\nHavana had one of the finest natural harbours in the [[West Indies]] with a 180&nbsp;m wide and 800&nbsp;m long entrance channel giving access to the harbour. Two strong [[fortress]]es defended the entrance channel; on the north side of the channel stood the very strong ''Castillo de los Tres Reyes del Morro'' (known in English as [[Morro Castle (Havana)|Morro Castle]]) on the rocky Cavannos Ridge. It had 64 heavy guns and was garrisoned by 700 men. However, it had been noted that most of its guns faced Havana's port and bay, and that it was overlooked by the unfortified hill of La Cabana. Although it had been proposed to fortify La Cabana, the project had been delayed and no guns had been installed there.<ref>Greentree p. 30</ref>The south side was defended by the older ''[[San Salvador de la Punta Fortress|Castillo de San Salvador de la Punta]]''.<ref name=\"Schneider68\">Schneider p. 68</ref> The channel could also be blocked by a [[boom (navigational barrier)|boom chain]] extending from El Morro to La Punta. Havana itself lay on the south side along the channel and was surrounded by a wall {{convert|5|km|mi}} long.<ref name=\"Schneider54\">Schneider p. 54</ref>\n\n===British preparations===\nTwo days after the declaration of war with Spain, on the advice of  [[George Anson, 1st Baron Anson|Lord Anson]], the British cabinet chose Havana as a major objective in its attack on Spain because of its strategic importance, believing that its permanent loss would weaken Spanish influence in the Caribbean. Detailed plans were made for a combined naval and military attack on Havana, relying on the Royal Navy's superiority in numbers and effectiveness over the Spanish fleet. Vice-Admiral Sir [[George Pocock]], with seven ships-of-the-line and a frigate, was to transport a military force under the command of [[George Keppel, 3rd Earl of Albemarle]] to the [[West Indies]], to join the West Indies naval squadron, then under the command of  [[George Brydges Rodney, 1st Baron Rodney|Rear-Admiral Rodney]], who was undertaking operations against [[Martinique]], taking on additional troops there. The fleet was then to proceed to the northwest of Saint-Domingue (present-day [[Haiti]]) to embark 4,000 men from the British colonies in North America, commanded by [[Jeffrey Amherst, 1st Baron Amherst|Jeffrey Amherst]], and be further reinforced by a squadron from [[Port Royal, Jamaica]], commanded by [[Sir James Douglas, 1st Baronet|Sir James Douglas]]. It was to keep its final destination in doubt until it launched its amphibious attack on Havana.<ref name=\"Bradley223-224\">Bradley pp. 223-224</ref>\n\nThese plans were modified to meet circumstances, as Rodney and [[Robert Monckton| General ]Monckton] commanding the troops had captured Martinique before Pocock sailed, 3,000 British and American troops from New York did not arrive at Havana until late July, and the plan to take up to 2,000 slaves from [[Jamaica]] to act as  [[Pioneer (military)|pioneers]] only produced 600 slaves, as many owners were reluctant to part with them.<ref name=\"Schneider128\">Schneider p. 128</ref> However, seven ships of the line and 4,365 soldiers aboard 64 transports sailed from [[Spithead]], England\n<ref name=\"Bradley224-225\">Bradley pp. 224-225</ref> A plan by Amherst to assemble a force of 8,000 men for an attack on [[French Louisiana|Louisiana]] was dismissed by Albemarle as impractical.<ref>Danley and Speelman p.320</ref>\n\nDuring the month of February, British troops embarked; they consisted of:\n* [[Cheshire regiment|22nd Regiment of Foot]]\n* [[34th Regiment of Foot]]\n* [[56th Regiment of Foot]]\n* [[72nd Richmond's Regiment of Foot]]\n\nOn 5 March the British expedition sailed from [[Spithead]], England, with 7 ships of the line and 4,365 men aboard 64 transports, and arrived in [[Barbados]] on 20 April.  Five days later the expedition reached [[Fort-de-France|Fort Royal]] on the recently conquered island of Martinique where it picked up the remainder of Major-General [[Robert Monckton]]'s expedition, still numbering 8,461 men. Rear Admiral Rodney's squadron, amounting to 8 ships of the line also joined the expedition bringing the total number of ships of the line to 15. On 23 May the expedition, now off the northwest corner of Saint-Domingue, was further reinforced by [[Sir James Douglas, 1st Baronet|Sir James Douglas]]' squadron from [[Port Royal, Jamaica]]. The combined force now amounted to 21 ships of the line, 24 lesser warships, and 168 other vessels, carrying some 14,000 seamen and marines plus another 3,000 hired sailors and 12,826 regulars.\n\n{{wide image|L'escadre anglaise pour attaquer La Havane en 1762.jpg|800px|align-cap=center|General view of the English squadron}}\n\n==Siege==\nThe  normal approach to Havana, on the north coast of Cuba, was to sail west parallel to the south coast of the island on the prevailing south-easterly wind, then to round its western tip and sail east towards Havana, against the wind. This last section, more than 200 [[mile]]s ling, would take a large squadron at least one week, and probably several, giving ample warning for Havana to prepare. To the north of Havana, as far as [[the Bahamas]] is a wide expanse of shallow water, [[reef]]s and small islands or [[cay]]s], accessible only to small boats except for one deep water channel, the [[Old Bahama Channel]] which is only some 10 miles wide at its narrowest. Although the Spanish navigators that charted it thought too dangerous for large warships, it was surveyed by a British frigate, whose captain left parties of his men in the cays to mark the extremities of the channel, allowing the whole fleet to pass through it, safely and undetected.<ref name=\"Bradley225\">Bradley p. 225</ref><ref name=\"Roger50-52\">Roger pp. 50-52</ref>   \n\nOn 6 June the British force came into sight of Havana. Immediately, 12 British ships of the line were sent to the mouth of the entrance channel to block in the Spanish fleet. The British planned to begin the operations by the reduction of the Morro fortress, on the north side of the channel, through a formal [[Vauban]]-style siege. The commanding position of this fort over the city would then force the Spanish commander to surrender. However, this plan did not take into account the fact that the fortress was located on a rocky promontory where it was impossible to dig approach trenches and that a large ditch cut into the rock protected the fort on the land side.\n[[File:Standard guide to Cuba - a new and complete guide to the island of Cuba, with maps, illustrations, routes of travel, history, and an English-Spanish phrase book (1909) (14801359763).jpg|thumb|Map of the Siege]]\n\nThe Spanish force under Prado and Admiral Hevia, surprised by the size of the attacking force, adopted a delaying defensive strategy. Prado wrote to the French in Saint-Domingue and to Spain for a relief force to be sent.<ref name=\"Schneider120\">Schneider p. 120</ref> Besides hope of a relief force, Prado and the Havana garrison had several advantages. Firstly, the [[hurricane]] season would begin in late August, putting the British fleet in danger: the wet weather starting earlier in that month would probably also initiate an outbreak of [[yellow fever]] among the besiegers.<ref name=\"Schneider126-127\">Schneider pp. 126-127</ref> Secondly, despite some losses from tropical diseases Prado had 1,500 Spanish regular soldiers and some 2,300 colonial [[militiamen]], as well as sailors from the fleet. The ships of the Spanish fleet was kept in the harbour while its sailors, gunners and marines were sent to garrison the fortresses of Morro and Punta which were placed under the command of naval officers.<ref name=\"Schneider121\">Schneider p. 121</ref> Most of the shot and powder of the fleet as well as its best guns were also transferred to these two fortresses. Meanwhile, regular troops were assigned to the defence of the city. Prado also ordered all women, children and the old and infirm to leave the city, leaving only men able to bear arms.<ref name=\"Schneider135\">Schneider p. 135</ref>\n\nThe channel entrance was immediately closed with the [[boom (navigational barrier)|boom chain]]. Furthermore, 3 ships of the line (''Asia'' (64), ''Europa'' (64) and ''Neptuno'' (74)) were selected among the fleet for their poor condition and sunk behind the boom chain. Although this made the remaining Spanish warships unable to leave the harbour, they were clearly outnumbered by the English fleet, and this move made the sailors available to defend the city. Realising the importance of the Morro, the Spanish commanders gave it top priority.<ref name=\"Schneider122\">Schneider p. 122</ref>\n\nThe following day British troops were landed northeast of Havana, and began advancing west the next day.<ref>Guiteras pp. 79-80</ref> They met a militia party that was easily pushed back. By the end of the day, British infantry had reached the vicinity of Havana.<ref>Pockock p. 221</ref>  The defence of the Morro was assigned to [[Luis Vicente de Velasco e Isla]], a naval officer, who immediately took measures to prepare and provision the fortress for a siege.<ref name=\"Schneider121\">Schneider p. 121</ref>\n\n===Siege of El Morro===\n[[File:LindsayCambridge.jpg|thumb|left|Bombardment of the Morro Castle, Havana, 1 July 1762 by [[Richard Paton]]]]\nOn 11 June a British party stormed a detached redoubt on the Cavannos heights.<ref>Guiteras p. 84</ref> Only then did the British command realise how strong the Morro was, surrounded by brushwood and protected by a large ditch.<ref>Pockock p. 226</ref>  With the arrival of their siege train the next day, the British began erecting batteries among the trees on La Cabana hill overlooking the Morro (some {{convert|7|m|ft}} higher) as well as the city and the bay. Surprisingly, this hill had been left undefended by the Spanish army despite its well-known strategic importance.<ref>Pockock p. 227</ref>  The king of Spain had even instructed Prado to fortify this hill, a task that he considered the most urgent among those confided to his commander.<ref name=\"Bradley226-227\">Bradley pp. 226-227</ref>\n\nTwo days later a British detachment landed at [[Torre\u00f3n de la Chorrera]], on the west side of the harbour. Meanwhile, Colonel [[Patrick Mackellar]], an engineer, was overseeing the construction of the siege works against the Morro.<ref>Pockock pp. 223-224</ref> Since digging trenches was impossible, he resolved to erect breastworks instead.<ref name=\"Bradley227-228\">Bradley pp. 227-228</ref> He planned to mine towards a bastion of the Morro once his siege works would have reached the ditch and to create a runway across this ditch with the rubble produced by his mining activities.\n\nBy 22 June, four British batteries totalling twelve heavy guns and 38 mortars opened fire on the Morro from La Cabana. Mackellar gradually advanced his breastworks towards the ditch under cover of these batteries so by the end of the month the British had increased their daily direct hits on the Morro to 500.<ref>Pockock p. 229</ref>  Velasco was losing as many as 30 men each day, and the workload of repairing the fortress every night was so exhausting that men had to be rotated into the fort from the city every three days. Velasco finally managed to convince Prado that a raid was necessary against the British batteries. At dawn on 29 June 988 men (a mixed company of grenadiers, marines, engineers, and slaves) attacked the siege works. They reached the British batteries from the rear and started to spike guns, but British reaction was swift, and the attackers were repulsed before they caused any serious damage.<ref>Pockock pp. 230-231</ref>\n[[File:Dominic Serres the Elder - The Capture of Havana, 1762, the English Battery before Morro Castle.jpg|thumb|300px|right|British siege guns before Morro Castle, by Dominic Serres]]\n\nOn 1 July, the British launched a combined land and naval attack on the Morro. The fleet detached four ships of the line for this purpose: [[HMS Stirling Castle (1742)|HMS ''Stirling Castle'']], [[HMS Dragon (1760)|HMS ''Dragon'']], [[HMS St Michael (1669)|HMS ''Marlborough'']] and [[HMS Cambridge (1755)|HMS ''Cambridge'']].<ref>Guiteras pp. 95-96</ref> The naval and land artillery simultaneously opened fire on the Morro. However, naval guns were ineffective, the fort being located too high.<ref>Pockock pp. 231-232</ref>  Counter-fire from thirty guns of the Morro inflicted 192 casualties and seriously damaged the ships, one of which was later scuttled, forcing them to withdraw. Meanwhile, the bombardment by the land artillery was far more effective. By the end of the day, only three Spanish guns were still effective on the side of the Morro facing the British batteries. The next day however British breastworks around the Morro caught fire and the batteries were burned down, destroying the product of much of the work undertaken since mid June.<ref>Pockock p. 237</ref> Velasco immediately capitalised on this event, remounting many guns and repairing breaches in the fortifications of the Morro.<ref>Guiteras p. 97</ref>\n\nSince its arrival at Havana, the British army had heavily suffered from [[yellow fever]] and was now at half strength. Since the [[Atlantic hurricane season|hurricane season]] was approaching, Albemarle was now engaged in a race against time. He ordered the batteries to be rebuilt with the help of men of the fleet. Many [[32-pounder gun]]s were taken from the lower deck of several ships to equip these new batteries.\n\nBy 17 July the new British batteries had progressively silenced most of Velasco's guns, leaving only two of them operational. With the absence of artillery cover, it now became impossible for the Spanish troops to repair the damage being inflicted on the Morro.<ref>Guiteras p. 104</ref> Mackellar was also able to resume construction of siege works to approach the fortress. With the army in such a bad condition, work progressed rather slowly. All hope of the British army now resided in the expected arrival of reinforcements from North America.\n[[File:Joshua reynolds, ritratto del general maggiore william keppel, 1762-65 ca.jpg|thumb|left|General [[William Keppel (British Army officer, born 1727)|William Keppel]], ''Storming the Morro Castle'', by [[Joshua Reynolds]]]]\n\nThe progress of siege works over the next few days allowed the British to begin the mining towards the right bastion of the Morro.<ref>Guiteras pp. 104-105</ref> Meanwhile, the now unopposed British artillery was daily hitting the Morro up to 600 times, causing some sixty casualties. Velasco had now no hope but to destroy British siege works and so on 22 July 1,300 regulars, seamen and militia sallied from Havana in three columns and attacked the siege works surrounding the Morro. The British repelled the Spanish sortie who thus withdrew to their lines and the siege works were left relatively intact.<ref>Guiteras pp. 107-108</ref>\n\nOn 24 July Albemarle offered Velasco the opportunity to surrender, allowing him to write his own terms of capitulation. Velasco answered that the issue would rather be settled by force of arms. Three days later the reinforcements from North America led by Colonel Burton finally arrived.<ref>Guiteras pp. 116-117</ref> During their journey, they had been attacked by the French, who captured some 500 men. These reinforcements consisted of:\n* [[46th (South Devonshire) Regiment of Foot|46th Thomas Murray's Regiment of Foot]]\n* [[58th (Rutlandshire) Regiment of Foot|58th Anstruther's Regiment of Foot]]\n* American provincials (3,000 men)\n* [[Gorham's Rangers|Gorham's]] and [[Danks' Rangers]] - which were combined into a 253-man ranger corps.\n\nOn 29 July the mine near the right bastion of the Morro fort was completed and ready to explode.<ref name=\"Schneider151\">Schneider p. 151</ref> Albemarle vainly feigned an assault, hoping that Velasco would finally decide to surrender. On the contrary, Velasco decided to launched a desperate attack from the sea upon the British miners in the ditch.<ref>Pockock p. 239</ref> At 2:00 am the next day two Spanish schooners attacked the miners from the sea. Their attack was unsuccessful and they had to withdraw. At 1:00 pm the British finally detonated the mine. The debris of the explosion partly filled the ditch but Albemarle judged it passable,<ref name=\"Schneider155\">Schneider p. 155</ref> and launched an assault, sending 699 picked men against the right bastion. Before the Spanish could react, sixteen men gained a foothold on the bastion.<ref>Pockock p. 241</ref> Velasco rushed to the breach with his troops, and was mortally wounded during the ensuing hand-to-hand fighting. The Spanish troops fell back, leaving the British in control of the Morro fort.<ref>Guiteras pp. 124-125</ref> Velasco was transported back to Havana, but by 31 July had died of his wounds.<ref name=\"Schneider151,225\">Schneider pp. 151, 225</ref>\n[[File:Spanish flag RMG RP-76-19.jpg|thumb|300px|Parts of a patched Spanish flag captured during the assault on Moro Castle, showing arms of [[Castille and Leon]] with [[House of Bourbon|Bourbon arms]] in centre surrounded by [[Order of the Golden Fleece]] (from [[Royal Museums Greenwich]])]]\n\nThe British then occupied a position commanding the city of Havana as well as the bay.<ref>Pockock p. 244</ref> Artillery batteries were brought up along the north side of the entrance channel from the Morro fort to La Cabana hill, where they could be trained directly on the town.<ref>Guiteras p. 142</ref>\n\n===Surrender===\nOn 11 August, after Prado had rejected the demand for surrender sent to him by Albemarle, the British batteries opened fire on Havana.<ref>Guiteras p. 144</ref> A total of 47 guns (15 \u00d7 32-pdrs, 32 \u00d7 24-pdrs), 10 mortars and 5 howitzers pounded the city from a distance of 500\u2013800 m.

They had obtained possession of the most important harbour in the [[Spanish West Indies]] along with military equipment, 1,828,116 Spanish pesos and merchandise valued around 1,000,000 Spanish pesos. Furthermore, they had seized 20% of the ships of the line of the Spanish Navy, namely ''Aquil\u00f3n'' (74), ''Conquistador'' (74), ''Reina'' (70), ''San Antonio'' (64), ''Tigre'' (70), ''San Jenaro'' (60), ''\u00c1frica'' (70), ''Am\u00e9rica'' (60), ''Infante'' (74) and ''Soberano'' (74), together with 3 frigates, 9 smaller vessels including the ''Marte'' (18) commanded by [[Domingo de Bonechea]] and some armed vessels belonging to trading companies (Compa\u00f1\u00eda de La Habana and Compa\u00f1\u00eda de Caracas). Furthermore, two new almost-completed ships of the line were seized in the dockyards \u2013 ''San Carlos'' (80) and ''Santiago'' (60 or 80). [[Prize money payments]] of \u00a3122,697 each were made to Pocock as naval commander and to Albemarle as military commander, with \u00a324,539 paid to  [[Augustus Keppel, 1st Viscount Keppel|Commodore Keppel]], the naval second-in-command who was Albemarle's younger brother. Each of the 42 naval captains present received \u00a31,600 as prize money.<ref>Roger p. 257</ref> The military second-in-command,  [[George Augustus Eliott, 1st Baron Heathfield|Lieutenant-General Eliott]], received the same amount as Commodore Keppel, as the two shared a fifteenth part of the prize pool, as against the third shared by their commanders.<ref>Pockock p. 216</ref>\n\n[[File:The Piazza at Havana RMG BHC0418.tiff|thumb|British troops at the [[Plaza Vieja, Havana|Plaza Vieja]] during their occupation of Havana]]\nDuring the siege the British had lost 2,764 killed, wounded, captured or deserted,<ref name=\"Marley291\"/> but by 18 October also had lost 4,708 dead from sickness.<ref name=\"Diefendorf\">Diefendorf p. 202</ref> One of the most depleted brigades was transferred to North America where it lost a further 360 men within a month of arrival. Three ships of the line were lost either as a direct result of Spanish gunfire or severe damage received which would cause their demise later.

Prado, Hevia and nine other military and civil officials were accused of treason and their trial was, in effect, a court martial, although it examined their actions actions during Prado's governorship as well as tactical decisions taken during the siege although Prado and several civil officials were mot military officers. The commission placed most of the blame on Prado and Hevia, finding them to have failed to fortify the Cabana properly and to have abandoned it too easily; to have crippled the Spanish fleet by sinking blockships that prevented the remainder taking action against the British and surrendered them intact rather than burning them; he had not mounted any significant counterattacks and, finally, had not removed the royal treasury before the surrender. After a lengthy trial, Pado was found guilty and sentenced to death, but was reprieved and died in prison. Hevia was sentenced to 10 years' house arrest and the loss of his titles, but was later reinstated.<ref name=\"Schneider227-229\">Schneider pp. 227-229</ref>\n\nThe loss of Havana and Western Cuba was a serious blow to Spain. Not only were the financial losses considerable, the loss in prestige was even greater. This defeat, together with the [[Battle of Manila (1762)|conquest of Manila by the British]] one and a half months later, meant the loss of Spain's 'Key to the New World and Rampart of the West Indies' as well as its colonial capital of the [[Spanish East Indies]].<ref name=\"Schneider6\">Schneider p. 6</ref> This confirmed British [[naval supremacy]], and showed the fragility of the [[Spanish Empire]]. Just as the earlier [[War of Jenkins' Ear]] had forced the British government into a thorough review of its military, this war forced the Spanish government into undertaking a similar process. The invasions of Navana and Manilla were the catalyst for profound political and military reforms in the Spanish overseas empire.<ref name=\"Schneider222\">Schneider p. 222</ref>\n\nHavana and Manila were returned to Spain as a result of the [[Treaty of Paris (1763)|Treaty of Paris]] signed in February 1763, but the British occupation lasted until April 1763, when a newly appointed  [[Captaincy General of Cuba|Captain General of Cuba]] arrived to re-establish Spanish rule.

British forces besieged and captured the city of [[Havana]], which at the time was an important [[Spanish Empire|Spanish]] naval base in the [[Caribbean]], and dealt a serious blow to the [[Spanish Navy]]. Havana was subsequently returned to Spain under the 1763 [[Treaty of Paris (1763)|Treaty of Paris]] that formally ended the war.\n\n==Background==\n{{main|Anglo-Spanish War (1762\u20131763)}}\nHavana in the late 18th century was a major port and naval base, and also the strongest fortress in Spanish America. Its royal shipyard with access to abundant supplies of resistant hardwoods was capable of building [[first-rate]] warships and had been developed by the Bourbon monarchy as the most important of its three naval shipyards.<ref name=\"Roger50\">Roger p. 50</ref><ref name=\"Schneider72-73\">Schneider pp. 72-73</ref> There had been several previous plans to attack Havana, including one proposed to [[Edward Vernon|Vernon]] in 1739, which he rejected in favour of an attack on  [[Battle of Porto Bello|Portobello]],<ref name=\"Bradley201\">Bradley p. 201</ref> but no successful attack since it was comprehensively fortified,<ref name=\"Schneider21\">Schneider p. 21</ref> and the strength of its fortifications and difficulty that large sailing warships would have in making an undetected approach from the north convinced the Spanish commanders it would be virtually impossible to capture, if its fortifications were in good order and it was properly garrisoned. Its wealth and ability to feed its population also suggested that it could resist being starved into surrender.<ref name=\"Roger50-51\">Roger pp. 50-51</ref><ref name=\"Schneider61,106\">Schneider pp. 61,106</ref>\n\nBritain had been formally at war with France since May 1756, but Spain under [[Ferdinand VI of Spain| Ferdinand VI]] remained neutral. After Ferdinand's death on 1759, his half-brother [[Charles III of Spain| Charles III]] reversed Ferdinand's policy and, by the [[Treaty of Paris (1761)]], re-established the so-called [[Pacte de Famille| Family Compact]] between France and Spain. This treaty involved an offensive alliance directed against Britain, and in December 1761, Spain placed an [[Economic sanctions| embargo]] on British trade, seized British goods and expelled British merchants. In response to this, Britain declared war on Spain in January 1762.<ref>Danley and Speelman pp. 431-432</ref> \n\n===Spanish preparations===\nBefore involving his country in the conflict raging in Europe and across the world, Charles III made provisions to defend the [[Spanish colonies]] against the [[British Royal Navy]]. For the defence of Cuba, he appointed [[Juan de Prado Mayera Portocarrero y Luna|Juan de Prado]] as commander-in-chief.  De Prado arrived at [[Havana]] in February 1761 and began work to improve the fortifications of the city.<ref name=\"Schneider82\">Schneider p. 82</ref>\n\nIn June 1761, a flotilla of seven [[ships of the line]] under the command of Admiral [[Gutierre de Hevia]] arrived at Havana, transporting two regular infantry regiments (Espa\u00f1a and Arag\u00f3n) totalling 996 men, bringing the Havana garrison to 2,400 regular infantry. There were also 6,300 sailors and marines aboard the ships.<ref>Greentree p. 15</ref> However, [[yellow fever]] had reduced the defending forces of the city by the time the siege began to 1,900 regular infantry, 750 marines, around 5,000 sailors and 2,000 to 3,000 armed militia, besides several thousand more without firearms or training.<ref>Greentree p. 20</ref> The main garrison consisted of:\n[[File:A plan of the Havana and its environs, with the several posts and attacks by Thomas Kitchin.jpg|thumb|left|300px|A plan of Havana and its environs in 1762, by [[Thomas Kitchen]]]]\n* Espa\u00f1a Infantry Regiment (481)\n* Arag\u00f3n Infantry Regiment (265)\n* Havana Infantry Regiment (856)\n* Edinburgh's Dragoons (150)\n* Army's gunners (104)\n* Navy's gunners and marines (750)\n\nHavana had one of the finest natural harbours in the [[West Indies]] with a 180&nbsp;m wide and 800&nbsp;m long entrance channel giving access to the harbour. Two strong [[fortress]]es defended the entrance channel; on the north side of the channel stood the very strong ''Castillo de los Tres Reyes del Morro'' (known in English as [[Morro Castle (Havana)|Morro Castle]]) on the rocky Cavannos Ridge. It had 64 heavy guns and was garrisoned by 700 men. However, it had been noted that most of its guns faced Havana's port and bay, and that it was overlooked by the unfortified hill of La Cabana. Although it had been proposed to fortify La Cabana, the project had been delayed and no guns had been installed there.<ref>Greentree p. 30</ref>The south side was defended by the older ''[[San Salvador de la Punta Fortress|Castillo de San Salvador de la Punta]]''.<ref name=\"Schneider68\">Schneider p. 68</ref> The channel could also be blocked by a [[boom (navigational barrier)|boom chain]] extending from El Morro to La Punta. Havana itself lay on the south side along the channel and was surrounded by a wall {{convert|5|km|mi}} long.<ref name=\"Schneider54\">Schneider p. 54</ref>\n\n===British preparations===\nTwo days after the declaration of war with Spain, on the advice of [[George Anson, 1st Baron Anson| Lord Anson]], the British cabinet chose Havana as a major objective in its attack on Spain because of its strategic importance, believing that its permanent loss would weaken Spanish influence in the Caribbean. Detailed plans were made for a combined naval and military attack on Havana, relying on the Royal Navy's superiority in numbers and effectiveness over the Spanish fleet. Vice-Admiral Sir [[George Pocock]], with seven ships-of-the-line and a frigate, was to transport a military force under the command of [[George Keppel, 3rd Earl of Albemarle]] to the [[West Indies]], to join the West Indies naval squadron, then under the command of [[George Brydges Rodney, 1st Baron Rodney| Rear-Admiral Rodney]], who was undertaking operations against [[Martinique]], taking on additional troops there. The fleet was then to proceed to the northwest of Saint-Domingue (present-day [[Haiti]]) to embark 4,000 men from the British colonies in North America, commanded by [[Jeffrey Amherst, 1st Baron Amherst|Jeffrey Amherst]], and be further reinforced by a squadron from [[Port Royal, Jamaica]], commanded by [[Sir James Douglas, 1st Baronet|Sir James Douglas]]. It was to keep its final destination in doubt until it launched its amphibious attack on Havana.<ref name=\"Bradley223-224\">Bradley pp. 223-224</ref> \n\nThese plans were modified to meet circumstances, as Rodney and [[Robert Monckton| General ]Monckton] commanding the troops had captured Martinique before Pocock sailed, 3,000 British and American troops from New York did not arrive at Havana until late July, and the plan to take up to 2,000 slaves from [[Jamaica]] to act as [[Pioneer (military)| pioneers]] only produced 600 slaves, as many owners were reluctant to part with them.<ref name=\"Schneider128\">Schneider p. 128</ref> However, seven ships of the line and 4,365 soldiers aboard 64 transports sailed from [[Spithead]], England \n<ref name=\"Bradley224-225\">Bradley pp. 224-225</ref> A plan by Amherst to assemble a force of 8,000 men for an attack on [[French Louisiana|Louisiana]] was dismissed by Albemarle as impractical.<ref>Danley and Speelman p.320</ref>\n\nDuring the month of February, British troops embarked; they consisted of:\n* [[Cheshire regiment|22nd Regiment of Foot]]\n* [[34th Regiment of Foot]]\n* [[56th Regiment of Foot]]\n* [[72nd Richmond's Regiment of Foot]]\n\nOn 5 March the British expedition sailed from [[Spithead]], England, with 7 ships of the line and 4,365 men aboard 64 transports, and arrived in [[Barbados]] on 20 April.  Five days later the expedition reached [[Fort-de-France|Fort Royal]] on the recently conquered island of Martinique where it picked up the remainder of Major-General [[Robert Monckton]]'s expedition, still numbering 8,461 men. Rear Admiral Rodney's squadron, amounting to 8 ships of the line also joined the expedition bringing the total number of ships of the line to 15. On 23 May the expedition, now off the northwest corner of Saint-Domingue, was further reinforced by [[Sir James Douglas, 1st Baronet|Sir James Douglas]]' squadron from [[Port Royal, Jamaica]]. The combined force now amounted to 21 ships of the line, 24 lesser warships, and 168 other vessels, carrying some 14,000 seamen and marines plus another 3,000 hired sailors and 12,826 regulars.\n\n{{wide image|L'escadre anglaise pour attaquer La Havane en 1762.jpg|800px|align-cap=center|General view of the English squadron}}\n\n==Siege==\nThe  normal approach to Havana, on the north coast of Cuba, was to sail west parallel to the south coast of the island on the prevailing south-easterly wind, then to round its western tip and sail east towards Havana, against the wind. This last section, more than 200 [[mile]]s ling, would take a large squadron at least one week, and probably several, giving ample warning for Havana to prepare. To the north of Havana, as far as [[the Bahamas]] is a wide expanse of shallow water, [[reef]]s and small islands or [[cay]]s], accessible only to small boats except for one deep water channel, the [[Old Bahama Channel]] which is only some 10 miles wide at its narrowest. Although the Spanish navigators that charted it thought too dangerous for large warships, it was surveyed by a British frigate, whose captain left parties of his men in the cays to mark the extremities of the channel, allowing the whole fleet to pass through it, safely and undetected.<ref name=\"Bradley225\">Bradley p. 225</ref><ref name=\"Roger50-52\">Roger pp. 50-52</ref>    \n\nOn 6 June the British force came into sight of Havana. Immediately, 12 British ships of the line were sent to the mouth of the entrance channel to block in the Spanish fleet. The British planned to begin the operations by the reduction of the Morro fortress, on the north side of the channel, through a formal [[Vauban]]-style siege. The commanding position of this fort over the city would then force the Spanish commander to surrender. However, this plan did not take into account the fact that the fortress was located on a rocky promontory where it was impossible to dig approach trenches and that a large ditch cut into the rock protected the fort on the land side.\n[[File:Standard guide to Cuba - a new and complete guide to the island of Cuba, with maps, illustrations, routes of travel, history, and an English-Spanish phrase book (1909) (14801359763).jpg|thumb|Map of the Siege]]\n\nThe Spanish force under Prado and Admiral Hevia, surprised by the size of the attacking force, adopted a delaying defensive strategy. Prado wrote to the French in Saint-Domingue and to Spain for a relief force to be sent.<ref name=\"Schneider120\">Schneider p. 120</ref> Besides hope of a relief force, Prado and the Havana garrison had several advantages. Firstly, the [[hurricane]] season would begin in late August, putting the British fleet in danger: the wet weather starting earlier in that month would probably also initiate an outbreak of [[yellow fever]] among the besiegers.<ref name=\"Schneider126-127\">Schneider pp. 126-127</ref> Secondly, despite some losses from tropical diseases Prado had 1,500 Spanish regular soldiers and some 2,300 colonial [[militiamen]], as well as sailors from the fleet. The ships of the Spanish fleet was kept in the harbour while its sailors, gunners and marines were sent to garrison the fortresses of Morro and Punta which were placed under the command of naval officers.<ref name=\"Schneider121\">Schneider p. 121</ref> Most of the shot and powder of the fleet as well as its best guns were also transferred to these two fortresses. Meanwhile, regular troops were assigned to the defence of the city. Prado also ordered all women, children and the old and infirm to leave the city, leaving only men able to bear arms.<ref name=\"Schneider135\">Schneider p. 135</ref>\n\nThe channel entrance was immediately closed with the [[boom (navigational barrier)|boom chain]]. Furthermore, 3 ships of the line (''Asia'' (64), ''Europa'' (64) and ''Neptuno'' (74)) were selected among the fleet for their poor condition and sunk behind the boom chain. Although this made the remaining Spanish warships unable to leave the harbour, they were clearly outnumbered by the English fleet, and this move made the sailors available to defend the city. Realising the importance of the Morro, the Spanish commanders gave it top priority.<ref name=\"Schneider122\">Schneider p. 122</ref>\n\nThe following day British troops were landed northeast of Havana, and began advancing west the next day.<ref>Guiteras pp. 79-80</ref> They met a militia party that was easily pushed back. By the end of the day, British infantry had reached the vicinity of Havana.<ref>Pockock p. 221</ref>  The defence of the Morro was assigned to [[Luis Vicente de Velasco e Isla]], a naval officer, who immediately took measures to prepare and provision the fortress for a siege.<ref name=\"Schneider121\">Schneider p. 121</ref>\n\n===Siege of El Morro===\n[[File:LindsayCambridge.jpg|thumb|left|Bombardment of the Morro Castle, Havana, 1 July 1762 by [[Richard Paton]]]]\nOn 11 June a British party stormed a detached redoubt on the Cavannos heights.<ref>Guiteras p. 84</ref> Only then did the British command realise how strong the Morro was, surrounded by brushwood and protected by a large ditch.<ref>Pockock p. 226</ref>  With the arrival of their siege train the next day, the British began erecting batteries among the trees on La Cabana hill overlooking the Morro (some {{convert|7|m|ft}} higher) as well as the city and the bay. Surprisingly, this hill had been left undefended by the Spanish army despite its well-known strategic importance.<ref>Pockock p. 227</ref>  The king of Spain had even instructed Prado to fortify this hill, a task that he considered the most urgent among those confided to his commander.<ref name=\"Bradley226-227\">Bradley pp. 226-227</ref>\n\nTwo days later a British detachment landed at [[Torre\u00f3n de la Chorrera]], on the west side of the harbour. Meanwhile, Colonel [[Patrick Mackellar]], an engineer, was overseeing the construction of the siege works against the Morro.<ref>Pockock pp. 223-224</ref> Since digging trenches was impossible, he resolved to erect breastworks instead.<ref name=\"Bradley227-228\">Bradley pp. 227-228</ref> He planned to mine towards a bastion of the Morro once his siege works would have reached the ditch and to create a runway across this ditch with the rubble produced by his mining activities.\n\nBy 22 June, four British batteries totalling twelve heavy guns and 38 mortars opened fire on the Morro from La Cabana. Mackellar gradually advanced his breastworks towards the ditch under cover of these batteries so by the end of the month the British had increased their daily direct hits on the Morro to 500.<ref>Pockock p. 229</ref>  Velasco was losing as many as 30 men each day, and the workload of repairing the fortress every night was so exhausting that men had to be rotated into the fort from the city every three days. Velasco finally managed to convince Prado that a raid was necessary against the British batteries. At dawn on 29 June 988 men (a mixed company of grenadiers, marines, engineers, and slaves) attacked the siege works. They reached the British batteries from the rear and started to spike guns, but British reaction was swift, and the attackers were repulsed before they caused any serious damage.<ref>Pockock pp. 230-231</ref>\n[[File:Dominic Serres the Elder - The Capture of Havana, 1762, the English Battery before Morro Castle.jpg|thumb|300px|right|British siege guns before Morro Castle, by Dominic Serres]]\n\nOn 1 July, the British launched a combined land and naval attack on the Morro. The fleet detached four ships of the line for this purpose: [[HMS Stirling Castle (1742)|HMS ''Stirling Castle'']], [[HMS Dragon (1760)|HMS ''Dragon'']], [[HMS St Michael (1669)|HMS ''Marlborough'']] and [[HMS Cambridge (1755)|HMS ''Cambridge'']].<ref>Guiteras pp. 95-96</ref> The naval and land artillery simultaneously opened fire on the Morro. However, naval guns were ineffective, the fort being located too high.<ref>Pockock pp. 231-232</ref>  Counter-fire from thirty guns of the Morro inflicted 192 casualties and seriously damaged the ships, one of which was later scuttled, forcing them to withdraw. Meanwhile, the bombardment by the land artillery was far more effective. By the end of the day, only three Spanish guns were still effective on the side of the Morro facing the British batteries. The next day however British breastworks around the Morro caught fire and the batteries were burned down, destroying the product of much of the work undertaken since mid June.<ref>Pockock p. 237</ref> Velasco immediately capitalised on this event, remounting many guns and repairing breaches in the fortifications of the Morro.<ref>Guiteras p. 97</ref>\n\nSince its arrival at Havana, the British army had heavily suffered from [[yellow fever]] and was now at half strength. Since the [[Atlantic hurricane season|hurricane season]] was approaching, Albemarle was now engaged in a race against time. He ordered the batteries to be rebuilt with the help of men of the fleet. Many [[32-pounder gun]]s were taken from the lower deck of several ships to equip these new batteries.\n\nBy 17 July the new British batteries had progressively silenced most of Velasco's guns, leaving only two of them operational. With the absence of artillery cover, it now became impossible for the Spanish troops to repair the damage being inflicted on the Morro.<ref>Guiteras p. 104</ref> Mackellar was also able to resume construction of siege works to approach the fortress. With the army in such a bad condition, work progressed rather slowly. All hope of the British army now resided in the expected arrival of reinforcements from North America.\n[[File:Joshua reynolds, ritratto del general maggiore william keppel, 1762-65 ca.jpg|thumb|left|General [[William Keppel (British Army officer, born 1727)|William Keppel]], ''Storming the Morro Castle'', by [[Joshua Reynolds]]]]\n\nThe progress of siege works over the next few days allowed the British to begin the mining towards the right bastion of the Morro.<ref>Guiteras pp. 104-105</ref> Meanwhile, the now unopposed British artillery was daily hitting the Morro up to 600 times, causing some sixty casualties. Velasco had now no hope but to destroy British siege works and so on 22 July 1,300 regulars, seamen and militia sallied from Havana in three columns and attacked the siege works surrounding the Morro. The British repelled the Spanish sortie who thus withdrew to their lines and the siege works were left relatively intact.<ref>Guiteras pp. 107-108</ref>\n\nOn 24 July Albemarle offered Velasco the opportunity to surrender, allowing him to write his own terms of capitulation. Velasco answered that the issue would rather be settled by force of arms. Three days later the reinforcements from North America led by Colonel Burton finally arrived.<ref>Guiteras pp. 116-117</ref> During their journey, they had been attacked by the French, who captured some 500 men. These reinforcements consisted of:\n* [[46th (South Devonshire) Regiment of Foot|46th Thomas Murray's Regiment of Foot]]\n* [[58th (Rutlandshire) Regiment of Foot|58th Anstruther's Regiment of Foot]]\n* American provincials (3,000 men)\n* [[Gorham's Rangers|Gorham's]] and [[Danks' Rangers]] - which were combined into a 253-man ranger corps.\n\nOn 29 July the mine near the right bastion of the Morro fort was completed and ready to explode.<ref name=\"Schneider151\">Schneider p. 151</ref> Albemarle vainly feigned an assault, hoping that Velasco would finally decide to surrender. On the contrary, Velasco decided to launched a desperate attack from the sea upon the British miners in the ditch.<ref>Pockock p. 239</ref> At 2:00 am the next day two Spanish schooners attacked the miners from the sea. Their attack was unsuccessful and they had to withdraw. At 1:00 pm the British finally detonated the mine. The debris of the explosion partly filled the ditch but Albemarle judged it passable,<ref name=\"Schneider155\">Schneider p. 155</ref> and launched an assault, sending 699 picked men against the right bastion. Before the Spanish could react, sixteen men gained a foothold on the bastion.<ref>Pockock p. 241</ref> Velasco rushed to the breach with his troops, and was mortally wounded during the ensuing hand-to-hand fighting. The Spanish troops fell back, leaving the British in control of the Morro fort.<ref>Guiteras pp. 124-125</ref> Velasco was transported back to Havana, but by 31 July had died of his wounds.<ref name=\"Schneider151,225\">Schneider pp. 151, 225</ref>\n[[File:Spanish flag RMG RP-76-19.jpg|thumb|300px|Parts of a patched Spanish flag captured during the assault on Moro Castle, showing arms of [[Castille and Leon]] with [[House of Bourbon|Bourbon arms]] in centre surrounded by [[Order of the Golden Fleece]] (from [[Royal Museums Greenwich]])]]\n\nThe British then occupied a position commanding the city of Havana as well as the bay.<ref>Pockock p. 244</ref> Artillery batteries were brought up along the north side of the entrance channel from the Morro fort to La Cabana hill, where they could be trained directly on the town.<ref>Guiteras p. 142</ref>\n\n===Surrender===\nOn 11 August, after Prado had rejected the demand for surrender sent to him by Albemarle, the British batteries opened fire on Havana.<ref>Guiteras p. 144</ref> A total of 47 guns (15 \u00d7 32-pdrs, 32 \u00d7 24-pdrs), 10 mortars and 5 howitzers pounded the city from a distance of 500\u2013800 m. By the end of the day [[San Salvador de la Punta Fortress|Fort la Punta]] was silenced. Prado had no other choice left but to surrender.<ref>Guiteras pp. 146-147</ref>\n\nThe next day negotiations of the articles of capitulation went on, and Prado and his army obtained the honours of war on 13 August.<ref>Guiteras pp. 149,163</ref> Hevia neglected to burn his fleet which fell intact in the hands of the British.\n\n==Aftermath==\n[[File:Dominic Serres the Elder - The Captured Spanish Fleet at Havana, August-September 1762.jpg|thumb|left|The Captured Spanish Fleet at Havana, August\u2013September 1762, by Dominic Serres]]\nOn 14 August the British entered the city. They had obtained possession of the most important harbour in the [[Spanish West Indies]] along with military equipment, 1,828,116 Spanish pesos and merchandise valued around 1,000,000 Spanish pesos. Furthermore, they had seized 20% of the ships of the line of the Spanish Navy, namely ''Aquil\u00f3n'' (74), ''Conquistador'' (74), ''Reina'' (70), ''San Antonio'' (64), ''Tigre'' (70), ''San Jenaro'' (60), ''\u00c1frica'' (70), ''Am\u00e9rica'' (60), ''Infante'' (74) and ''Soberano'' (74), together with 3 frigates, 9 smaller vessels including the ''Marte'' (18) commanded by [[Domingo de Bonechea]] and some armed vessels belonging to trading companies (Compa\u00f1\u00eda de La Habana and Compa\u00f1\u00eda de Caracas). Furthermore, two new almost-completed ships of the line were seized in the dockyards \u2013 ''San Carlos'' (80) and ''Santiago'' (60 or 80). [[Prize money payments]] of \u00a3122,697 each were made to Pocock as naval commander and to Albemarle as military commander, with \u00a324,539 paid to  [[Augustus Keppel, 1st Viscount Keppel|Commodore Keppel]], the naval second-in-command who was Albemarle's younger brother. Each of the 42 naval captains present received \u00a31,600 as prize money.<ref>Roger p. 257</ref> The military second-in-command,  [[George Augustus Eliott, 1st Baron Heathfield|Lieutenant-General Eliott]], received the same amount as Commodore Keppel, as the two shared a fifteenth part of the prize pool, as against the third shared by their commanders.<ref>Pockock p. 216</ref>\n\n[[File:The Piazza at Havana RMG BHC0418.tiff|thumb|British troops at the [[Plaza Vieja, Havana|Plaza Vieja]] during their occupation of Havana]]\nDuring the siege the British had lost 2,764 killed, wounded, captured or deserted,<ref name=\"Marley291\"/> but by 18 October also had lost 4,708 dead from sickness.<ref name=\"Diefendorf\">Diefendorf p. 202</ref> One of the most depleted brigades was transferred to North America where it lost a further 360 men within a month of arrival. Three ships of the line were lost either as a direct result of Spanish gunfire or severe damage received which would cause their demise later. Shortly after the siege {{HMS|Stirling Castle|1742|6}} was declared unserviceable and was stripped and scuttled.<ref>Winfield p. 49</ref> [[HMS St Michael (1669)|HMS ''Marlborough'']] sank in the Atlantic due to extensive damage received during the siege, and {{HMS|Temple|1758|6}} was lost while returning to Britain for repairs.<ref>Lavery p. 177</ref>\n\nCharles III appointed a commission of generals to try Prado and others considered culpable for the loss of Havana on their return to Spain. Prado, Hevia and nine other military and civil officials were accused of treason and their trial was, in effect, a court martial, although it examined their actions actions during Prado's governorship as well as tactical decisions taken during the siege although Prado and several civil officials were mot military officers. The commission placed most of the blame on Prado and Hevia, finding them to have failed to fortify the Cabana properly and to have abandoned it too easily; to have crippled the Spanish fleet by sinking blockships that prevented the remainder taking action against the British and surrendered them intact rather than burning them; he had not mounted any significant counterattacks and, finally, had not removed the royal treasury before the surrender. After a lengthy trial, Pado was found guilty and sentenced to death, but was reprieved and died in prison. Hevia was sentenced to 10 years' house arrest and the loss of his titles, but was later reinstated.<ref name=\"Schneider227-229\">Schneider pp. 227-229</ref>\n\nThe loss of Havana and Western Cuba was a serious blow to Spain. Not only were the financial losses considerable, the loss in prestige was even greater. This defeat, together with the [[Battle of Manila (1762)|conquest of Manila by the British]] one and a half months later, meant the loss of Spain's 'Key to the New World and Rampart of the West Indies' as well as its colonial capital of the [[Spanish East Indies]].<ref name=\"Schneider6\">Schneider p. 6</ref> This confirmed British [[naval supremacy]], and showed the fragility of the [[Spanish Empire]]. Just as the earlier [[War of Jenkins' Ear]] had forced the British government into a thorough review of its military, this war forced the Spanish government into undertaking a similar process. The invasions of Navana and Manilla were the catalyst for profound political and military reforms in the Spanish overseas empire.<ref name=\"Schneider222\">Schneider p. 222</ref>\n\nHavana and Manila were returned to Spain as a result of the [[Treaty of Paris (1763)|Treaty of Paris]] signed in February 1763, but the British occupation lasted until April 1763, when a newly appointed  [[Captaincy General of Cuba|Captain General of Cuba]] arrived to re-establish Spanish rule.
