The game takes in a large city still recovering from a war decades prior to the game's start, with players taking the role of an amnesic detective who has been charged with solving a murder mystery. During the investigation, he comes to recall events about his own past as well as current forces trying to affect the city. Inspired by [[Infinity Engine]]\u2013era role-playing games, particularly ''[[Planescape: Torment]]'', ''Disco Elysium'' was written and designed by [[Estonians|Estonian]] novelist [[Robert Kurvitz]]. It features a distinctive [[watercolor]] art style, and music by the band [[British Sea Power]]. It was released for [[Microsoft Windows]] on 15 October 2019, with [[PlayStation 4]], [[Xbox One]], and [[Nintendo Switch]] releases planned for 2020.\n\n''Disco Elysium'' is a non-traditional role-playing game featuring no combat. Instead, resolution of events are done though skill checks and [[dialog tree]]s via a system of 24 skills that represent different aspects of the protagonist, such as their pain threshold and perception. In addition, a system called the \"Thought Cabinet\" represents other ideologies and personality traits of the protagonist, with players having the ability to freely support or suppress them. The game was based on a [[tabletop role-playing game]] setting that Kurvitz had previously created, with him forming ZA/UM in 2016 as a way to build out the game. ''Disco Elysium'' was critically acclaimed, with it being named as a [[game of the year]] by several publications and winning numerous other awards for its narrative and art.\n\n==Gameplay==\n[[File:Disco Elysium interface.jpg|thumb|left|The current dialog for ''Disco Elysium'' running along the right side of the screen showing conversations in white and choices in red, atop the current scene the character is in]]\n''Disco Elysium'' is a [[role-playing video game]] that features an [[open world]] and dialogue-heavy gameplay mechanics.<ref name=PCGUS/><ref name=techspot>{{cite web |last=Cohen |first=Coberly |date=16 October 2019 |url=https://www.techspot.com/news/82354-ambitious-open-world-rpg-disco-elysium-you-take.html |title=Ambitious open-world RPG Disco Elysium lets you take on the role of a mentally unstable detective |publisher=Techspot |accessdate=5 April 2020}}</ref> The game is presented in an [[Isometric video game graphics|isometric perspective]] in which the [[player character]] is controlled.<ref name=USgamer/> The player takes the role of a detective on a murder case who suffers from alcohol and drug-induced amnesia.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Lang |first1=Brad |date=17 October 2019 |title=Disco Elysium Review \u2013 Stayin' Alive |url=https://www.criticalhit.net/review/disco-elysium-review-stayin-alive/ |website=Critical Hit |accessdate=18 October 2019}}</ref> The player can move the detective about the current screen to interact with [[non-player character]]s (NPC) and highlighted objects or move onto other screens. Early in the game they gain a partner, Kim Kitsuragi, another detective who acts as the protagonist's voice of professionalism and who may be able to offer advice or support in certain dialog options. Other NPCs may be influenced to become temporary companies that join the group and provide similar support.\n\nThe gameplay features no combat in the traditional sense; instead, it is handled through skill checks and [[dialog tree|dialogue trees]].<ref name=gamecrate>{{cite web |date=16 October 2019 |first=Justin |last=Woo |url=https://www.gamecrate.com/disco-elysium-character-generation-skill-checks-and-gameplay-strategy/24424 |title=Disco Elysium: Character generation, skill checks and gameplay strategy |website=GameCrate |accessdate=5 April 2020}}</ref> There are four primary abilities in the game: Intellect, Psyche, Physique, and Motorics, and each ability has six distinct secondary skills for a total of 24.<ref name=rockpapershotgunskills>{{cite web |date=14 October 2019 |first=Ollie |last=Toms |url=https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/2019/10/14/disco-elysium-skills-character-creation-intellect-psyche-physique-motorics-and-the-24-skills-explained/ |title=Disco Elysium skills & character creation: Intellect, Psyche, Physique, Motorics, and the 24 skills explained |website=[[Rock, Paper, Shotgun]] |accessdate=5 April 2020}}</ref> The player improves these skills through skill points earned from leveling up. The choice of clothing that the player equips on the player-character can impart both positive and negative effects on certain skills.<ref name=gamecrate/> Upgrading these skills help the player character pass skill checks, made based on a random dice roll, but could also potentially result in negative effects and character quirks. For instance, a player character with high Drama may be able to detect and fabricate lies effectively, but may also become prone to hysterics and paranoia. Likewise, high Electrochemistry shields the player character from the negative effects of drugs and provides knowledge on them, but may also lead to substance abuse and other self-destructive behaviors.<ref name=rockpapershotgunskills/>\n\n''Disco Elysium'' features a secondary inventory system, the Thought Cabinet. Thoughts are unlockable through conversations with other characters, as well as through internal dialogues within the mind of the player character himself. The player is then able to \"internalize\" a thought through a certain amount of in-game hours, which, once completed, grants the player character permanent benefits but also occasionally negative effects, a concept that ZA/UM compared to the trait system used in the ''[[Fallout (video game series)|Fallout]]'' series.<ref name=\"zaum hungarian interview\">{{cite web | url = https://zaumstudio.com/2017/03/31/the-hungarian-interview/ | title = The Hungarian Interview| first = Mikk | last = Metsniit | date = 31 March 2017 | accessdate = 8 April 2020 | publisher = ZA/UM }}</ref> A limited number of slots are available in the Thought Cabinet at the start, though more can be gained with experience levels. For example, an early possible option for the Thought Cabinet is the \"Hobocop\" thought, which the character ponders the option of living on the streets to save money, which reduces the character's composure with other NPCs while the thought is internalized. When the character has completed the Hobocop thought, it then allows them to find more junk on the streets that can be sold for money.<ref>{{cite web |date=15 October 2019 |first=Ollie |last=Toms |url=https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/2019/10/15/disco-elysium-thought-cabinet-the-thoughts-system-explained/#what-is-the-thought-cabinet |title=Disco Elysium Thought Cabinet: the Thoughts system explained |website=[[Rock, Paper, Shotgun]] |accessdate=5 April 2020}}</ref><ref name=\"GSpot\"/>\n\nThe 24 skills also play into the dialogue trees, creating a situation where the player-character may have an internal debate with one aspect of their mind or body, creating the idea that the player is communicating with a fragmented persona. These internal conversations may provide suggestions or additional insight that can guide the player into actions or dialogue with the game's non-playable characters, depending on the skill points invested into the skill. For example, the Inland Empire, a subskill of the Psyche, is described by ZA/UM as a representation of the intensity of the soul, and may come into situations where the player-character may need to pass themselves off under a fake identity with the conviction behind that stance, should the player accept this suggestion when debating with Inland Empire.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.pcgamer.com/your-skills-talk-to-you-in-disco-elysium-an-inventive-rpg-that-keeps-impressing/ |title=Your skills talk to you in Disco Elysium, an inventive RPG that keeps impressing |first=David |last=O'Keefe |date=10 September 2018 |accessdate=7 April 2020 |work=[[PC Gamer]]}}</ref>\n\n== Synopsis ==\n\n=== Setting ===\n''Disco Elysium'' takes place in the fantastic realism world of Elyisum that had been developed by Kurvitz and his team in the years prior, which includes a fleshed-out six-thousand year history of conflicts, with the game taking place during the setting's most modern period known as \"The Seventies\".<ref name=\"zaum hungarian interview\"/> Elysium is made of landmasses known as isolas that are separated by the Pale, a mysterious connective tissue in which the laws of reality begin to break down. Prolonged exposure to the Pale can cause mental instability, and traversing the Pale is considered highly dangerous.<ref name=gamerant>{{cite web |date=24 January 2020 |first=Philip |last=Trahan |url=https://gamerant.com/disco-elysium-world-explained/ |title=The World of Disco Elysium Explained |website=GameRant |accessdate=5 April 2020}}</ref> Nations and people within ''Disco Elysium'' follow different ideologies, including [[communism]], [[fascism]], moralism (the setting's stand-in for [[centrism]]) and ultraliberalism (the setting's stand-in for [[right-libertarianism]]).\n\nThe setting's political and cultural history is also markedly different. The philosophy of communism was founded by an economist and a historical materialist named Kras Mazov, and rather than being associated with the color red and symbols like [[hammer and sickle]], the ideology is instead represented by the color white and symbolised by deer antlers surrounding a pentagram. Moralism, meanwhile, despite being a centrist ideology, also has religious overtones and connotations, since it is associated with the setting's largest religion, the Moralist International, the dominant feature of which are the so-called \"Innocences\", [[saint]]-like figures, who also wielded great religious and political power while they were alive, akin to the position of pope. The greatest and most influential amongst the historical Innocences is Dolores Dei, a woman of mysterious origins, who allegedly had glowing lungs and founded many of the world's modern institutions. Due to Dolores Dei's influence, the symbol of love in ''Disco Elysium''{{'s}} world is a set of lungs, rather than a heart.\n\nEvents in the game take place in the fictional city of Revachol on the isola of Insulinde, specifically in Martinaise, a district plagued by poverty, crime, and corruption.<ref name=\"PCGUS\" /><ref name=gamerant/> Five decades before the start of the game, a communist revolution took place in Revachol and successfully overthrew the old monarchy that controlled the city. A [[Commune (model of government)|commune]] was formed afterwards, but it was soon toppled by an invasion of an alliance of capitalist nations calling themselves \"the Coalition\". Revachol has since been designated a Special Administrative Region under the Coalition, who holds a strong grip over the city's local economy and keeps its autonomy at a minimum. One of the few governmental functions that Revachol is allowed to handle itself is upholding day to day law and order, which is the task of the Revachol Citizens Militia (RCM). While starting as a voluntary citizens brigade, the RCM has since grown and evolved into a semi-professional police force.\n\n=== Plot ===\n{{plot|date=March 2020}}\nThe player character wakes up in a trashed cafeteria motel room with a severe hangover and no memory of his own identity. He is greeted by a Lieutenant Kim Kitsuragi, who informs him that they have been assigned to investigate the death of a hanged man in the cafeteria's backyard. His identity is unclear and initial investigation indicates that he was [[lynched]] by a group of people. The detectives set out to explore the rest of the district, following up on leads while investigating smaller cases, helping residents with a variety of tasks.\n\nThese tasks allow the player to begin to fill in gaps in the detective\u2019s identity, revealing him to be  Harrier \"Harry\" DuBois. A decorated RCM detective, Harry experienced an event several years ago that began a [[mid-life crisis]], eventually culminating in a self-destructive bender around Martinaise in which he dismissed the rest of his squad. Through their work, they discover the killing appears to be connected to an ongoing strike by the Martinaise\u2019s dockworkers union against the Wild Pines corporation. They seek out representatives of both the dockworkers and the Wild Pines corporation, meeting up with Evrart Claire for more information on the union and Joyce Messier on the involvement of Wild Pines.\n\nThis leads them to discover that the man was killed before the hanging. The Hardie Boys, a group of dockworkers who act as [[Vigilante|vigilantes]] in Martinaise, claim collective responsibility for the murder. They assert that the man attempted to rape a cafeteria guest by the name of Klaasje. Seeking more information on the man, they return to Joyce, who reveals that the hanged man's name was 'Lely' and that he was a member of a mercenary squad assigned to protect Joyce during negotiations with the union. However, the death of Lely has driven them to go rogue. Joyce warns that unless the detectives find the true culprit soon, the mercenaries will likely enact bloody retribution across Martinaise.\n\nThey meet with Klassje for her end of the story who reveals that Lely was shot in the mouth while the two were having sex. Unable to figure out the origin of the bullet and fearful of involving the authorities, Klaasje enlisted the help of a dockworker named Ruby, who with the rest of the Hardie Boys staged Lely's death as a hanging. The detectives then follow the trail across the shore and eventually find Ruby hiding within an abandoned building, where she incapacitates them with a Pale device. She claims that the cover-up was all Klaasje's idea and has no idea who shot Lely. The player manages to resist or disable the Pale device and tries to arrest her. Ruby states that she would rather kill herself, which she does if she is unable to escape.\n\nThe detectives return to find themselves in a standoff between the mercenaries and the Hardie Boys. A firefight breaks out and the player is badly wounded, blacking out and waking up a few days later. Most or all the mercenaries are killed and Kim may be hospitalized, in which case street urchin Cuno offers to take his place. The detectives begin chasing down their last leads, ultimately determining that the shot that killed Lely came from an old sea fort just off the shore of Martinaise.\n\nWhile at the fort, Harry has a dream in which he meets a manifestation of his ex-fianc\u00e9e Dora Ingerlund, who left Harry out of both dissatisfaction at his low income and his mental instability. She then reveals that this is what drove Harry onto his emotional breakdown; he is plagued by this same dream recurring every couple of days, the moment of her leaving him and him trying and failing to win her back and unable to move on from her.\n\nThe detectives explore the rest of the fort and find the shooter: a former Commissar from the old Revachol communist army named Iosef Lilianovich Dros. Iosef's motivations are revealed to be ultimately born out of his bitterness towards the new capitalist system Lely represented, as well as his sexual envy for Klaasje. With all of the evidence now found, the detectives arrest him for the murder. At this point, the Insulindian Phasmid appears from the reeds. The player may be able to have a psychic conversation with the Phasmid, who tells Harry that it finds the notion of his unstable mind to be fearful, but is in awe at his ability to continue existing day after day. It comforts Harry, telling him to move on from the wreck of his life and move forward. After the detectives take its picture, the Phasmid moves on.\n\nHarry and his partner are confronted by his old squad upon their return to Martenaise. They reflect on Harry's actions during the game, whether he has solved the case and how he handled the mercenaries, as well as being impressed by the news that the Phasmid does exist. Harry's former partner Jean Vicquemare confirms that Harry's emotional breakdown was indeed the result of Dora leaving him several years ago. If the player has done well, the squad expresses hope that Harry's state will improve in the future, and invites him and either Kim or Cuno to a special RCM unit.\n\n==Development==\n''Disco Elysium'' was developed by ZA/UM, a company founded in 2016 by [[Karelians|Karelian]]-[[Estonians|Estonian]] novelist [[Robert Kurvitz]], who served as the game's lead writer and designer.<ref name= Gamesindustry>{{cite web |last=Taylor |first=Haydn |date=31 October 2018 |url=https://www.gamesindustry.biz/articles/2018-10-31-disco-elysium |title=Chasing oblivion with Disco Elysium and alcohol addiction |website=Gamesindustry.biz}}</ref><ref name= Kurvitz>{{cite web |last1=Macgregor |first1=Jody |title=Disco Elysium's lead designer wants to make an expansion and sequel, has already written a novel |url=https://www.pcgamer.com/disco-elysiums-lead-designer-wants-to-make-an-expansion-and-sequel-has-already-written-a-novel/ |website=PC Gamer |accessdate=13 November 2019}}</ref> Kurvitz since 2001 had been part of a band called Ultramelanhool, and in 2005, while in [[Tallinn]], Estonia, with the group struggling for finances, conceived of a fictional world during a drunken evening while listening to [[Ti\u00ebsto]]'s \"[[Adagio for Strings (Ti\u00ebsto song)|Adagio for Strings]]\".<ref name=\"gamesradar conception\">{{cite web |url=https://www.gamesradar.com/the-making-of-disco-elysium-how-zaum-created-one-of-the-most-original-rpgs-of-the-decade/ |title=The making of Disco Elysium: How ZA/UM created one of the most original RPGs of the decade |first=Alex |last=Wiltshire |date=9 January 2020 |accessdate=8 April 2020 |work=[[GamesRadar]]}}</ref> Feeling this had a solid idea, the group created a collective of artists and musicians, which included Aleksander Rostov, to expand upon the work of that night and developed a [[tabletop RPG]] based on ''[[Dungeons & Dragons]]'' on this [[steampunk]]-like concept.<ref name=\"gamesradar conception\"/> During this period, Kurvitz met Estonian author [[Kaur Kender]] who helped him to write a novel set in this world, ''Sacred and Terrible Air'',<ref name= Kurvitz/> which was published in 2013 but only sold about one thousand copies. Kurvitz fell into a period of depression and alcoholism for about three years following the book's failing.<ref name=\"gamesradar conception\"/>\n\nKurvitz eventually pulled himself out of his alcoholism, and helped Kender to also surpass his personal period of alcoholism. As a sign of gratitude, Kender suggested to Kurvitz that instead of pursuing a novel that he try capturing his world as a video game instead as to draw a larger interest. Kurvitz had no experience in video games before, but once he had seen artwork of the game's setting of Revachol as easily fitting into an [[isometric RPG|isometric format]], as well as Rostov's agreement that they might as well continue taking the risk of failing on a video game together, Kurvitz proceeded with the idea.<ref name=\"gamesradar conception\"/> Kurvitz wrote a concise description of what the game would be: \"AD&D meets '70s cop-show, in an original 'fantastic realist' setting, with swords, guns and motor-cars. Realised as an isometric CRPG \u2013 a modern advancement on the legendary Planescape: Torment and Baldur's Gate. Massive, reactive story. Exploring a vast, poverty-stricken ghetto. Deep, strategic combat.\"<ref name=\"gamesradar conception\"/> Kender was impressed on the strong statement that he invested into the game's development, with additional investment coming from friends and family.<ref name=\"gamesradar conception\"/> The game was announced as an upcoming 2017 game under the title ''No Truce With the Furies'',<ref name=\"gamesradar conception\"/> taken from the poem \"Reflections\" by [[R.S. Thomas]] and published in Thomas' ''No Truce with the Furies'' in 1995.<ref name=\"egm title\"/>\n\nKurvitz established the ZA/UM team to create the game, using the name \"za um\" which could be read in Russian as either \"for the mind\" or \"from the mind\", while the use of all-capitals and the slash to present the team as \"something that definitely exists and weighs eight tonnes\".<ref name=\"gamesradar conception\"/> Work on the game started around 2016, with the local team working out of a [[Squatting|squat]] in a former gallery in Tallinn. They were able to secure venture capital into the game during that first year which allowed Kurvitz to seek out the band [[British Sea Power]] for their music for the game's soundtrack. While in [[Birmingham]] to speak to the band, Kurvitz realised England was a better location for the main development team as there were more local resources for both development and for voice-overs.<ref name=\"gamesradar conception\"/> During development, some of the staff relocated from Estonia to London and [[Brighton]], with other designers working out of [[Poland]], [[Romania]], and [[China]].<ref name=gamesindustry.biz/><ref name=Postimees>{{cite news |last1=Altk\u00fcla |first1=Magnus |title=Kaur Kender on new computer game: It\u2019s like 'Truth and Justice' |url=https://news.postimees.ee/6807443/kaur-kender-on-new-computer-game-it-s-like-truth-and-justice |publisher=[[Postimees]] |date=22 October 2019 |accessdate=29 December 2019}}</ref> Overall, by the time of the game's release, ZA/UM had about 20 outside consultants and 35 in-house developers,<ref name=\"gamesradar conception\"/> with a team of eight writers assisting Kurvitz in the game's dialog.<ref name=gamesindustry.biz>{{Cite web |url=https://www.gamesindustry.biz/articles/2017-07-20-making-games-under-threat-of-nuclear-war |title=Making games under threat of nuclear war |website=GamesIndustry.biz}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |last1=Price |first1=Edward |title=Disco Elysium \u2013 Rezzed 2018 Interview |url=https://gameanalytics.com/blog/disco-elysium-rezzed-2018-interview.html |website=gameanalytics.com |accessdate=19 October 2019}}</ref> The majority of the game's funding was provided by Estonian businessman {{ill|Margus Linnam\u00e4e|et|Margus Linnam\u00e4e}}.<ref name=Postimees/><ref>{{Cite web |url=https://raha.geenius.ee/rubriik/uudis/kaur-kenderi-uus-videomanguari-on-neelanud-juba-700-000-eurot-investorite-raha/ |title=Kaur Kenderi uus videom\u00e4ngu\u00e4ri on neelanud juba 700 000 eurot investorite raha |first=Deisi |last=Helem\u00e4e |publisher=Geenius.ee |date=5 September 2018 |lang=Estonian |accessdate=30 December 2019}}</ref> \n\nAs originally planned, the game was to focus on action in a single city location to make the 2017 release.

After this March 2020 release, ''Disco Elysium'' gained a large number of Chinese players; according to Abacus News of the ''[[South China Morning Post]]'' which translated Steam reviews left by Chinese players, these players were drawn to the game as it reflected similar periods of communism that Chinese citizens had gone through, and thus resonated with these players.<ref>{{cite web | url = https://www.pcgamer.com/disco-elysium-is-an-unexpected-hit-in-china-thanks-to-a-new-translation/ | title = Disco Elysium is an unexpected hit in China, thanks to a new translation | first=  Steven | last = Messner | date = 8 April 2020 | accessdate = 8 April 2020 | work = [[PC Gamer]] }}</ref>\n\n==Reception==\n{{Video game reviews\n| MC = 91/100<ref name=MC>{{cite web |url=https://www.metacritic.com/game/pc/disco-elysium |title=Disco Elysium for PC Reviews |website=[[Metacritic]] |publisher=[[CBS Interactive]] |accessdate=10 March 2020}}</ref>\n| GSpot = 10/10<ref name=GSpot>{{cite web |last=Wildgoose |first=David |date=4 November 2019 |url=https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/disco-elysium-review-pure-dynamite/1900-6417354/ |title=Disco Elysium Review -

The game takes in a large city still recovering from a war decades prior to the game's start, with players taking the role of an amnesic detective who has been charged with solving a murder mystery. During the investigation, he comes to recall events about his own past as well as current forces trying to affect the city. Inspired by [[Infinity Engine]]\u2013era role-playing games, particularly ''[[Planescape: Torment]]'', ''Disco Elysium'' was written and designed by [[Estonians|Estonian]] novelist [[Robert Kurvitz]]. It features a distinctive [[watercolor]] art style, and music by the band [[British Sea Power]]. It was released for [[Microsoft Windows]] on 15 October 2019, with [[PlayStation 4]], [[Xbox One]], and [[Nintendo Switch]] releases planned for 2020.\n\n''Disco Elysium'' is a non-traditional role-playing game featuring no combat. Instead, resolution of events are done though skill checks and [[dialog tree]]s via a system of 24 skills that represent different aspects of the protagonist, such as their pain threshold and perception. In addition, a system called the \"Thought Cabinet\" represents other ideologies and personality traits of the protagonist, with players having the ability to freely support or suppress them. The game was based on a [[tabletop role-playing game]] setting that Kurvitz had previously created, with him forming ZA/UM in 2016 as a way to build out the game. ''Disco Elysium'' was critically acclaimed, with it being named as a [[game of the year]] by several publications and winning numerous other awards for its narrative and art.\n\n==Gameplay==\n[[File:Disco Elysium interface.jpg|thumb|left|The current dialog for ''Disco Elysium'' running along the right side of the screen showing conversations in white and choices in red, atop the current scene the character is in]]\n''Disco Elysium'' is a [[role-playing video game]] that features an [[open world]] and dialogue-heavy gameplay mechanics.<ref name=PCGUS/><ref name=techspot>{{cite web |last=Cohen |first=Coberly |date=16 October 2019 |url=https://www.techspot.com/news/82354-ambitious-open-world-rpg-disco-elysium-you-take.html |title=Ambitious open-world RPG Disco Elysium lets you take on the role of a mentally unstable detective |publisher=Techspot |accessdate=5 April 2020}}</ref> The game is presented in an [[Isometric video game graphics|isometric perspective]] in which the [[player character]] is controlled.<ref name=USgamer/> The player takes the role of a detective on a murder case who suffers from alcohol and drug-induced amnesia.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Lang |first1=Brad |date=17 October 2019 |title=Disco Elysium Review \u2013 Stayin' Alive |url=https://www.criticalhit.net/review/disco-elysium-review-stayin-alive/ |website=Critical Hit |accessdate=18 October 2019}}</ref> The player can move the detective about the current screen to interact with [[non-player character]]s (NPC) and highlighted objects or move onto other screens. Early in the game they gain a partner, Kim Kitsuragi, another detective who acts as the protagonist's voice of professionalism and who may be able to offer advice or support in certain dialog options. Other NPCs may be influenced to become temporary companies that join the group and provide similar support.\n\nThe gameplay features no combat in the traditional sense; instead, it is handled through skill checks and [[dialog tree|dialogue trees]].<ref name=gamecrate>{{cite web |date=16 October 2019 |first=Justin |last=Woo |url=https://www.gamecrate.com/disco-elysium-character-generation-skill-checks-and-gameplay-strategy/24424 |title=Disco Elysium: Character generation, skill checks and gameplay strategy |website=GameCrate |accessdate=5 April 2020}}</ref> There are four primary abilities in the game: Intellect, Psyche, Physique, and Motorics, and each ability has six distinct secondary skills for a total of 24.<ref name=rockpapershotgunskills>{{cite web |date=14 October 2019 |first=Ollie |last=Toms |url=https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/2019/10/14/disco-elysium-skills-character-creation-intellect-psyche-physique-motorics-and-the-24-skills-explained/ |title=Disco Elysium skills & character creation: Intellect, Psyche, Physique, Motorics, and the 24 skills explained |website=[[Rock, Paper, Shotgun]] |accessdate=5 April 2020}}</ref> The player improves these skills through skill points earned from leveling up. The choice of clothing that the player equips on the player-character can impart both positive and negative effects on certain skills.<ref name=gamecrate/> Upgrading these skills help the player character pass skill checks, made based on a random dice roll, but could also potentially result in negative effects and character quirks. For instance, a player character with high Drama may be able to detect and fabricate lies effectively, but may also become prone to hysterics and paranoia. Likewise, high Electrochemistry shields the player character from the negative effects of drugs and provides knowledge on them, but may also lead to substance abuse and other self-destructive behaviors.<ref name=rockpapershotgunskills/>\n\n''Disco Elysium'' features a secondary inventory system, the Thought Cabinet. Thoughts are unlockable through conversations with other characters, as well as through internal dialogues within the mind of the player character himself. The player is then able to \"internalize\" a thought through a certain amount of in-game hours, which, once completed, grants the player character permanent benefits but also occasionally negative effects, a concept that ZA/UM compared to the trait system used in the ''[[Fallout (video game series)|Fallout]]'' series.<ref name=\"zaum hungarian interview\">{{cite web | url = https://zaumstudio.com/2017/03/31/the-hungarian-interview/ | title = The Hungarian Interview| first = Mikk | last = Metsniit | date = 31 March 2017 | accessdate = 8 April 2020 | publisher = ZA/UM }}</ref> A limited number of slots are available in the Thought Cabinet at the start, though more can be gained with experience levels. For example, an early possible option for the Thought Cabinet is the \"Hobocop\" thought, which the character ponders the option of living on the streets to save money, which reduces the character's composure with other NPCs while the thought is internalized. When the character has completed the Hobocop thought, it then allows them to find more junk on the streets that can be sold for money.<ref>{{cite web |date=15 October 2019 |first=Ollie |last=Toms |url=https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/2019/10/15/disco-elysium-thought-cabinet-the-thoughts-system-explained/#what-is-the-thought-cabinet |title=Disco Elysium Thought Cabinet: the Thoughts system explained |website=[[Rock, Paper, Shotgun]] |accessdate=5 April 2020}}</ref><ref name=\"GSpot\"/>\n\nThe 24 skills also play into the dialogue trees, creating a situation where the player-character may have an internal debate with one aspect of their mind or body, creating the idea that the player is communicating with a fragmented persona. These internal conversations may provide suggestions or additional insight that can guide the player into actions or dialogue with the game's non-playable characters, depending on the skill points invested into the skill. For example, the Inland Empire, a subskill of the Psyche, is described by ZA/UM as a representation of the intensity of the soul, and may come into situations where the player-character may need to pass themselves off under a fake identity with the conviction behind that stance, should the player accept this suggestion when debating with Inland Empire.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.pcgamer.com/your-skills-talk-to-you-in-disco-elysium-an-inventive-rpg-that-keeps-impressing/ |title=Your skills talk to you in Disco Elysium, an inventive RPG that keeps impressing |first=David |last=O'Keefe |date=10 September 2018 |accessdate=7 April 2020 |work=[[PC Gamer]]}}</ref>\n\n== Synopsis ==\n\n=== Setting ===\n''Disco Elysium'' takes place in the fantastic realism world of Elyisum that had been developed by Kurvitz and his team in the years prior, which includes a fleshed-out six-thousand year history of conflicts, with the game taking place during the setting's most modern period known as \"The Seventies\".<ref name=\"zaum hungarian interview\"/> Elysium is made of landmasses known as isolas that are separated by the Pale, a mysterious connective tissue in which the laws of reality begin to break down. Prolonged exposure to the Pale can cause mental instability, and traversing the Pale is considered highly dangerous.<ref name=gamerant>{{cite web |date=24 January 2020 |first=Philip |last=Trahan |url=https://gamerant.com/disco-elysium-world-explained/ |title=The World of Disco Elysium Explained |website=GameRant |accessdate=5 April 2020}}</ref> Nations and people within ''Disco Elysium'' follow different ideologies, including [[communism]], [[fascism]], moralism (the setting's stand-in for [[centrism]]) and ultraliberalism (the setting's stand-in for [[right-libertarianism]]).\n\nThe setting's political and cultural history is also markedly different. The philosophy of communism was founded by an economist and a historical materialist named Kras Mazov, and rather than being associated with the color red and symbols like [[hammer and sickle]], the ideology is instead represented by the color white and symbolised by deer antlers surrounding a pentagram. Moralism, meanwhile, despite being a centrist ideology, also has religious overtones and connotations, since it is associated with the setting's largest religion, the Moralist International, the dominant feature of which are the so-called \"Innocences\", [[saint]]-like figures, who also wielded great religious and political power while they were alive, akin to the position of pope. The greatest and most influential amongst the historical Innocences is Dolores Dei, a woman of mysterious origins, who allegedly had glowing lungs and founded many of the world's modern institutions. Due to Dolores Dei's influence, the symbol of love in ''Disco Elysium''{{'s}} world is a set of lungs, rather than a heart.\n\nEvents in the game take place in the fictional city of Revachol on the isola of Insulinde, specifically in Martinaise, a district plagued by poverty, crime, and corruption.<ref name=\"PCGUS\" /><ref name=gamerant/> Five decades before the start of the game, a communist revolution took place in Revachol and successfully overthrew the old monarchy that controlled the city. A [[Commune (model of government)|commune]] was formed afterwards, but it was soon toppled by an invasion of an alliance of capitalist nations calling themselves \"the Coalition\". Revachol has since been designated a Special Administrative Region under the Coalition, who holds a strong grip over the city's local economy and keeps its autonomy at a minimum. One of the few governmental functions that Revachol is allowed to handle itself is upholding day to day law and order, which is the task of the Revachol Citizens Militia (RCM). While starting as a voluntary citizens brigade, the RCM has since grown and evolved into a semi-professional police force.\n\n=== Plot ===\n{{plot|date=March 2020}}\nThe player character wakes up in a trashed cafeteria motel room with a severe hangover and no memory of his own identity. He is greeted by a Lieutenant Kim Kitsuragi, who informs him that they have been assigned to investigate the death of a hanged man in the cafeteria's backyard. His identity is unclear and initial investigation indicates that he was [[lynched]] by a group of people. The detectives set out to explore the rest of the district, following up on leads while investigating smaller cases, helping residents with a variety of tasks.\n\nThese tasks allow the player to begin to fill in gaps in the detective\u2019s identity, revealing him to be  Harrier \"Harry\" DuBois. A decorated RCM detective, Harry experienced an event several years ago that began a [[mid-life crisis]], eventually culminating in a self-destructive bender around Martinaise in which he dismissed the rest of his squad. Through their work, they discover the killing appears to be connected to an ongoing strike by the Martinaise\u2019s dockworkers union against the Wild Pines corporation. They seek out representatives of both the dockworkers and the Wild Pines corporation, meeting up with Evrart Claire for more information on the union and Joyce Messier on the involvement of Wild Pines.\n\nThis leads them to discover that the man was killed before the hanging. The Hardie Boys, a group of dockworkers who act as [[Vigilante|vigilantes]] in Martinaise, claim collective responsibility for the murder. They assert that the man attempted to rape a cafeteria guest by the name of Klaasje. Seeking more information on the man, they return to Joyce, who reveals that the hanged man's name was 'Lely' and that he was a member of a mercenary squad assigned to protect Joyce during negotiations with the union. However, the death of Lely has driven them to go rogue. Joyce warns that unless the detectives find the true culprit soon, the mercenaries will likely enact bloody retribution across Martinaise.\n\nThey meet with Klassje for her end of the story who reveals that Lely was shot in the mouth while the two were having sex. Unable to figure out the origin of the bullet and fearful of involving the authorities, Klaasje enlisted the help of a dockworker named Ruby, who with the rest of the Hardie Boys staged Lely's death as a hanging. The detectives then follow the trail across the shore and eventually find Ruby hiding within an abandoned building, where she incapacitates them with a Pale device. She claims that the cover-up was all Klaasje's idea and has no idea who shot Lely. The player manages to resist or disable the Pale device and tries to arrest her. Ruby states that she would rather kill herself, which she does if she is unable to escape.\n\nThe detectives return to find themselves in a standoff between the mercenaries and the Hardie Boys. A firefight breaks out and the player is badly wounded, blacking out and waking up a few days later. Most or all the mercenaries are killed and Kim may be hospitalized, in which case street urchin Cuno offers to take his place. The detectives begin chasing down their last leads, ultimately determining that the shot that killed Lely came from an old sea fort just off the shore of Martinaise.\n\nWhile at the fort, Harry has a dream in which he meets a manifestation of his ex-fianc\u00e9e Dora Ingerlund, who left Harry out of both dissatisfaction at his low income and his mental instability. She then reveals that this is what drove Harry onto his emotional breakdown; he is plagued by this same dream recurring every couple of days, the moment of her leaving him and him trying and failing to win her back and unable to move on from her.\n\nThe detectives explore the rest of the fort and find the shooter: a former Commissar from the old Revachol communist army named Iosef Lilianovich Dros. Iosef's motivations are revealed to be ultimately born out of his bitterness towards the new capitalist system Lely represented, as well as his sexual envy for Klaasje. With all of the evidence now found, the detectives arrest him for the murder. At this point, the Insulindian Phasmid appears from the reeds. The player may be able to have a psychic conversation with the Phasmid, who tells Harry that it finds the notion of his unstable mind to be fearful, but is in awe at his ability to continue existing day after day. It comforts Harry, telling him to move on from the wreck of his life and move forward. After the detectives take its picture, the Phasmid moves on.\n\nHarry and his partner are confronted by his old squad upon their return to Martenaise. They reflect on Harry's actions during the game, whether he has solved the case and how he handled the mercenaries, as well as being impressed by the news that the Phasmid does exist. Harry's former partner Jean Vicquemare confirms that Harry's emotional breakdown was indeed the result of Dora leaving him several years ago. If the player has done well, the squad expresses hope that Harry's state will improve in the future, and invites him and either Kim or Cuno to a special RCM unit.\n\n==Development==\n''Disco Elysium'' was developed by ZA/UM, a company founded in 2016 by [[Karelians|Karelian]]-[[Estonians|Estonian]] novelist [[Robert Kurvitz]], who served as the game's lead writer and designer.<ref name= Gamesindustry>{{cite web |last=Taylor |first=Haydn |date=31 October 2018 |url=https://www.gamesindustry.biz/articles/2018-10-31-disco-elysium |title=Chasing oblivion with Disco Elysium and alcohol addiction |website=Gamesindustry.biz}}</ref><ref name= Kurvitz>{{cite web |last1=Macgregor |first1=Jody |title=Disco Elysium's lead designer wants to make an expansion and sequel, has already written a novel |url=https://www.pcgamer.com/disco-elysiums-lead-designer-wants-to-make-an-expansion-and-sequel-has-already-written-a-novel/ |website=PC Gamer |accessdate=13 November 2019}}</ref> Kurvitz since 2001 had been part of a band called Ultramelanhool, and in 2005, while in [[Tallinn]], Estonia, with the group struggling for finances, conceived of a fictional world during a drunken evening while listening to [[Ti\u00ebsto]]'s \"[[Adagio for Strings (Ti\u00ebsto song)|Adagio for Strings]]\".<ref name=\"gamesradar conception\">{{cite web |url=https://www.gamesradar.com/the-making-of-disco-elysium-how-zaum-created-one-of-the-most-original-rpgs-of-the-decade/ |title=The making of Disco Elysium: How ZA/UM created one of the most original RPGs of the decade |first=Alex |last=Wiltshire |date=9 January 2020 |accessdate=8 April 2020 |work=[[GamesRadar]]}}</ref> Feeling this had a solid idea, the group created a collective of artists and musicians, which included Aleksander Rostov, to expand upon the work of that night and developed a [[tabletop RPG]] based on ''[[Dungeons & Dragons]]'' on this [[steampunk]]-like concept.<ref name=\"gamesradar conception\"/> During this period, Kurvitz met Estonian author [[Kaur Kender]] who helped him to write a novel set in this world, ''Sacred and Terrible Air'',<ref name= Kurvitz/> which was published in 2013 but only sold about one thousand copies. Kurvitz fell into a period of depression and alcoholism for about three years following the book's failing.<ref name=\"gamesradar conception\"/>\n\nKurvitz eventually pulled himself out of his alcoholism, and helped Kender to also surpass his personal period of alcoholism. As a sign of gratitude, Kender suggested to Kurvitz that instead of pursuing a novel that he try capturing his world as a video game instead as to draw a larger interest. Kurvitz had no experience in video games before, but once he had seen artwork of the game's setting of Revachol as easily fitting into an [[isometric RPG|isometric format]], as well as Rostov's agreement that they might as well continue taking the risk of failing on a video game together, Kurvitz proceeded with the idea.<ref name=\"gamesradar conception\"/> Kurvitz wrote a concise description of what the game would be: \"AD&D meets '70s cop-show, in an original 'fantastic realist' setting, with swords, guns and motor-cars. Realised as an isometric CRPG \u2013 a modern advancement on the legendary Planescape: Torment and Baldur's Gate. Massive, reactive story. Exploring a vast, poverty-stricken ghetto. Deep, strategic combat.\"<ref name=\"gamesradar conception\"/> Kender was impressed on the strong statement that he invested into the game's development, with additional investment coming from friends and family.<ref name=\"gamesradar conception\"/> The game was announced as an upcoming 2017 game under the title ''No Truce With the Furies'',<ref name=\"gamesradar conception\"/> taken from the poem \"Reflections\" by [[R.S. Thomas]] and published in Thomas' ''No Truce with the Furies'' in 1995.<ref name=\"egm title\"/>\n\nKurvitz established the ZA/UM team to create the game, using the name \"za um\" which could be read in Russian as either \"for the mind\" or \"from the mind\", while the use of all-capitals and the slash to present the team as \"something that definitely exists and weighs eight tonnes\".<ref name=\"gamesradar conception\"/> Work on the game started around 2016, with the local team working out of a [[Squatting|squat]] in a former gallery in Tallinn. They were able to secure venture capital into the game during that first year which allowed Kurvitz to seek out the band [[British Sea Power]] for their music for the game's soundtrack. While in [[Birmingham]] to speak to the band, Kurvitz realised England was a better location for the main development team as there were more local resources for both development and for voice-overs.<ref name=\"gamesradar conception\"/> During development, some of the staff relocated from Estonia to London and [[Brighton]], with other designers working out of [[Poland]], [[Romania]], and [[China]].<ref name=gamesindustry.biz/><ref name=Postimees>{{cite news |last1=Altk\u00fcla |first1=Magnus |title=Kaur Kender on new computer game: It\u2019s like 'Truth and Justice' |url=https://news.postimees.ee/6807443/kaur-kender-on-new-computer-game-it-s-like-truth-and-justice |publisher=[[Postimees]] |date=22 October 2019 |accessdate=29 December 2019}}</ref> Overall, by the time of the game's release, ZA/UM had about 20 outside consultants and 35 in-house developers,<ref name=\"gamesradar conception\"/> with a team of eight writers assisting Kurvitz in the game's dialog.<ref name=gamesindustry.biz>{{Cite web |url=https://www.gamesindustry.biz/articles/2017-07-20-making-games-under-threat-of-nuclear-war |title=Making games under threat of nuclear war |website=GamesIndustry.biz}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |last1=Price |first1=Edward |title=Disco Elysium \u2013 Rezzed 2018 Interview |url=https://gameanalytics.com/blog/disco-elysium-rezzed-2018-interview.html |website=gameanalytics.com |accessdate=19 October 2019}}</ref> The majority of the game's funding was provided by Estonian businessman {{ill|Margus Linnam\u00e4e|et|Margus Linnam\u00e4e}}.<ref name=Postimees/><ref>{{Cite web |url=https://raha.geenius.ee/rubriik/uudis/kaur-kenderi-uus-videomanguari-on-neelanud-juba-700-000-eurot-investorite-raha/ |title=Kaur Kenderi uus videom\u00e4ngu\u00e4ri on neelanud juba 700 000 eurot investorite raha |first=Deisi |last=Helem\u00e4e |publisher=Geenius.ee |date=5 September 2018 |lang=Estonian |accessdate=30 December 2019}}</ref> \n\nAs originally planned, the game was to focus on action in a single city location to make the 2017 release.

Macmillan argued that the main issue was a claim in restitution, and so the proper law to determine the issue was English law.  The respondent banks argued that the main issue was who had title to the shares, and so the proper law to determine that issue was New York law.\n\nThe trial at first instance on the full facts ([1995] 1 WLR 978, before [[Peter Millett, Baron Millett|Millet J]]) had taken \"the best part of a year, from October 1992 to July 1993\".<ref>[1996] 1 WLR 387 at 393B</ref>  The respondent banks won at first instance and upon appeal. \n\n==Facts==\n\nMacmillan Inc was a company incorporated in Delaware, and which was controlled by [[Robert Maxwell]]  It owned a majority shareholding in [[Berlitz Corporation|Berlitz International Inc]], a New York company.  Under the direction of Maxwell the shares in Berlitz were transferred to Bishopsgate Investments Trust plc (a company owned and controlled by Robert Maxwell and his family<ref>[1996] 1 WLR 387 at 394B</ref>) as its nominee.  Then, without MacMillan's consent or knowledge, the shares were mortgaged by Bishopsgate to secure loans from three different financial institutions to fund Maxwell's private interests.{{sfn|Ooi|p=3}}<ref name=LMCLQ />  Accordingly, although it was named as the first defendant in the action, Bishopsgate played little part - the main dispute was fought between Macmillan and the banks who had loaned money to Robert Maxwell on the strength of the Berlitz shares as [[Collateral (finance)|collateral]].\n\nThe central issue in the case was who had better title to the shares: MacMillan as beneficiary under a trust, or the financial institutions as mortgagees.  The key to determining these issues was deciding which was the proper law to determine title to the shares.  The only previous case relating to this issue (''Colonial Bank Ltd v Cady and Williams'' (1890) 15 App Cas 267) had been decided over a century before, followed by an \"astonishing period of legal barrenness in judicial and academic consideration\".{{sfn|Ooi|p=1}}  However, in the present case the issue was complicated by the fact that many of the shares were held indirectly through a [[Central securities depository|securities depository]], [[Depository Trust Company]].\n\nAt first instance, after an extremely lengthy trial, Millet J held that the proper law to determine priority of claims was the ''[[lex loci contractus]]'' which was New York law.  Accordingly, the banks prevailed.  Macmillan appealed against the decision, and it was agreed to hear the appeal as to what the proper law to determine the issue was as a preliminary point.  The case was conducted largely under the assumption was that if New York law determined title, then the banks would win because they had no actual notice of wrongdoing.  But if English law determined title, then Macmillan had an arguable case that the banks had constructive notice of Robert Maxwell's fraud on the grounds they ought to have known he was engaging in fraud when he caused the shares to be mortgaged for the benefit of loans to his private businesses.\n\n==Judgment==\n\nAll three judges in the Court of Appeal gave reasoned decisions.  One of the most common criticisms of the decision is that although all three judges agreed as to the outcome (that New York law applied), they all gave different reasons - and all of their reasons were different from that of the trial judge.{{sfn|Ooi|p=6}}\n\n===Staughton LJ===\n\nThe first decision was given by [[Christopher Staughton|Staughton LJ]].  He indicated that in relation to a conflict of laws problem, the court essentially has a three-stage problem:\n<blockquote>\nThere are in essence three issues before us, corresponding to the three stages in a conflict case which I have mentioned.  They are: (a) how does one characterise the question in this action? (b) What connecting factor does our conflict rule provide for questions of that character? (c) What system of law does that connecting factor require to be applied?<ref>[1996] 1 WLR 387 at 393G</ref>\n</blockquote>\nHe then summarised the facts and reviewed the issues each in turn.\n\nIn relation to Stage 1 (characterisation), Macmillan contended the claim relating to restitution ([[unjust enrichment in English law|unjust enrichment]]), and so the issue should be decided in accordance with Rule 201, sub-rule (c) of [[Dicey Morris & Collins|Dicey & Morris]] (12th ed.).  In the context of this case, that would result in the application of English law, as the law of the place where the enrichment occurs.  However he rejected that characterisation - the issue was not whether the banks were enriched - it was whether they had a good defence to the return of the shares.  In that case it was not a question of characterising the claim, but characterising the core issue.<ref>[1996] 1 WLR 387 at 399C</ref>\n\nIn relation to Stage 2 (choice of law) he held that the relevant law was clearly that of the ''[[lex situs]]'' of the property, and cited various authorities in support including ''[[Winkworth v Christie Manson and Woods Ltd]]'' [1980] Ch 496 and ''[[Inglis v Robertson]]'' [1898] AC 616.  But he noted that those cases related to goods, and that the same rule applied in relation to negotiable instruments. However, in relation to intangible property such as [[choses in action]], the usual rule was the priority was determined by the proper law of the chose in action, not its situs (citing Dicey & Morris (12th ed.), Rule 123).  He then considered whether shares have \"a rule of their own\".  He noted that the evidence of American law (as the law under which the company who issued the shares was incorporated), shares were not negotiable instruments (following ''Williams v Colonial Bank'' sub nom ''Cady'' (1888) 38 Ch D 388 at 403).  He reviewed ''Cady'' in some detail and confessed to finding it difficult to draw the boundaries between the issues being discussed.<ref>[1996] 1 WLR 387 at 404E</ref>  Then with slightly abrupt suddenness he held:\n<blockquote>\nI conclude that an issue as to who has title to the shares in a company should be decided by the law of the place where the shares are situated (lex situs).  ... and in this case, that is the law of the place where the company is incorporated.  There may be cases where it is arguably the law of the place where the share register is kept, but that problem does not arise today.  The reference is to the domestic law of the place in question; at one time there was an argument for renvoi, but mercifully (or sadly, as the case may be) that has been abandoned.<ref>[1996] 1 WLR 387 at 405B</ref>\n</blockquote>\nHe then went on to consider Stage 3 (system of law).  He held that \"[w]hether it be situs, place of incorporation or place of share register, the answer is the law of and prevailing in the State of New YOrk.\"<ref>[1996] 1 WLR 387 at 405C</ref>\n\n===Auld LJ===\n\nThe second (and shortest) judgment was given by [[Robin Auld|Auld LJ]].  He opened by summarising the issue as \"Who has the better right to ownership of shares in a corporation?\"<ref>[1996] 1 WLR 387 at 405C</ref>  He also noted that Macmillan framed this issue as a claim for restitution, but the banks asserted it was an issue of priority of claims in relation to an asset.  He reviewed the recent cases in what was called \"receipt-based restitutionary claims\" and referred to academic articles which cautioned about how new developments in domestic law should be treated when applying historical choice of law rules.<ref>Adrian Briggs, 'Restitution Meets the Conflict of Laws' [1995] RLR 94 at 97.</ref>  He noted that the usual rule in relation to property claims was to apply the lex situs, and then expresses doubts as to whether choice of law based on restitutionary claims is advisable in this case.  He noted that the claim for unjust enrichment was difficult in any event, as the banks gave full value.  He eventually concluded that \"even if the facts could support a claim for unjust enrichment, it is the issue that determiend the matter.  As I have said, it is essentially a proprietary one\".<ref>[1996] 1 WLR 387 at 409A</ref>  He rejected the view of the trial judge that the lex loci actus was applicable to the issue.\n\nTurning to the issue of what the lex situs of shares was, he review the authorities which he felt were unsatisfactory.  He stated that:\n<blockquote>\nIn my view, there is authority and much to be said for treating issues of priority of ownership of shares in a corporation according to the lex situs of those shares.  That will normally be the country where the register is kept, usually but not always the country of incorporation. If the shares are negotiable the lex situs will be where the pieces of paper constituting the negotiable instruments are at the time of transfer.<ref>[1996] 1 WLR 387 at 411D</ref>\n</blockquote>\nHe then also reviewed ''Cady'' and distinguished it.  He affirmed that the proper law to determine the issue was New York law.  Although he did not explicitly reject ''renvoi'' he stated that the proper law was \"the ''domestic'' law of New York.<ref>[1996] 1 WLR 387 at 413H (emphasis added)</ref>\n\n===Aldous LJ===\n\nThe third and final judgment was given by [[William Aldous|Aldous LJ]].<ref>Curiously counsel for one of the banks in the case was Richard Aldous QC, who was the brother of Aldous LJ.</ref>  After setting out the facts again in some detail, he also affirmed that Macmillan had argued its case on the basis that English law was the proper law to determine the issue as the issue before the court was one of restitution.  Conversely the banks argued that this was an issue as to who had the better priority to the shares as a matter of property law.  As with the other judges in the Court of Appeal, Aldous LJ felt that this was an issue of property law.  He held: \"The issue being one of priority, the law having the closest and most real connection must be New York law.  That is the law which governs the right in dispute, namely the right to be placed on the register.\"<ref>[1996] 1 WLR 387 at 419F</ref> He went on to expound:\n<blockquote>\nI have no doubt that the transferability of shares in a corporation, the formalities necessary to transfer them and the right of the transferee to be registered on the books of the corporation as the owner of the shares are all governed by the law of incorporation.<ref>[1996] 1 WLR 387 at 419H</ref>\n</blockquote>\nHe then proceeded with his own review of ''Cady'' (which he asserted supported his position).  He also cited a long string of North American decisions relating to the issue.  He then concluded: \"I believe the appropriate law to decide questions of title to property, such as shares, is the lex situs, which is the same as the law of incorporation.\"<ref>[1996] 1 WLR 387 at 424F</ref>\n\n===Overview===\n\nAlthough the case is often held up as being determinative of the lex situs of a share in a company, and/or as determining that the doctrine of ''[[renvoi]]'' does not apply to intangible property, neither of those points were actually in issue in the case.  Macmillan argued for an entirely separate choice of law issue relating to a different characerisation.  And the comments of the Court of Appeal in relation to the situs of shares all agreed that they were located in New York, but expressed somewhat different views as to why that was so.  The decision that renvoi was not applicable was similarly not argued, as both sides were content that any reference to a foreign law should solely be to the domestic law.  Similarly, neither party argued for a different choice of law rule on the basis that the shares were held through intermediaries rather than directly held.<ref>Maisi Ooi, \u2018Intermediation and its effect on investor rights\u2019 (2015) 131 LQR 536</ref>\n\nIn relation to whether different issues applied to shares that were negotiable, again the court did not speak with one voice.  Both Staughton and Auld LJJ expressed the view that negotiable shares were subject to a different choice of law rule - the law of the place where the relevant certificates were located.  But they differed in their judgments as to which law should determine whether shares were negotiable or not: Staughton LJ indicating it was the lex fori and Auld suggesting it was the law of the place where act of negotiation occurs.  Ooi rejects both as incorrect.{{sfn|Ooi|p=9}}<ref>It is clear that for at least some negotiable instruments, it will be the place of negotiation, see [[Bills of Exchange Act 1882]], section 72.</ref>  She favours the view of Aldous LJ who implies that the situs of a share, even when negotiable, is the place of the company's incorporation.{{sfn|Ooi|p=17}}\n\n==Reception==\n\nThe case broadly received a mixed reception from commentators.  It is accepted as authoritative in relation to its approach to characterisation.{{sfn|Cheshire|p=43}}{{sfn|Hill|p=19}}  However its rejection of renvoi is not seen as completely definitive.{{sfn|Cheshire|p=71}}{{sfn|Hill|p=34}}<ref>Relatively little argument was addressed to the Court of Appeal on renvoi. However renvoi was a live issue in the trial at first instance, and was rejected by Millet J (see first instance decision at [1995] 1 WLR 978 at 1008C-G).  Against that decision there was no appeal.</ref>  \n\nIn relation to the main subject for which the case is normally cited, the situs of shares in a company, [[Dicey Morris & Collins]] accept it as good authority, but note that it has to be read against a large group of cases which seek to impose a different situs in different situations for different purposes.{{sfn|Dicey|p=1296}}  Hill treats it as largely authoritative with respect to the choice of the lex situs, but refrains from commenting upon the identification of the situs for shares.{{sfn|Hill|p=483}}  In that regard it is hard to treat it as a definitive statement of the law.  Maisie Ooi in her definitive work on the subject expresses discomfort in relation to the parts of the judgment which refer to the situs of shares being determined by the place of the register.{{sfn|Ooi|p=6}}\n\n==Subsequent decisions==\n\nThe [[Supreme Court of the United Kingdom|Supreme Court]] endorsed the decision in {{cite bailii|litigants=[[Akers v Samba Financial Group]]|year=2017|court=UKSC|num=6}}.  Notably [[Jonathan Sumption, Lord Sumption|Lord Sumption]] summarised its effects as \"transmission of property is governed by the lex situs, which in the case of registered shares is the law of the company's incorporation... This proposition is well established and was not seriously disputed: see ''Macmillan Inc v Bishopsgate Investment Trust Plc (No 3)'' [1996] 1 WLR 387.\" (at para [80]).  [[Jonathan Mance, Baron Mance|Lord Mance]] also referred to the decision with approval, but did not comment specifically on the lex situs of shares.\n\nIn {{cite bailii|litigants=Dornoch Ltd v Westminster International BV |year=2009 |court=EWHC |num=889 |division=Admlty}} [[Stephen Tomlinson|Tomlinson J]] suggested that the conflicting decisions in ''Macmillan'' are misconstrued.  In his judgment he noted that:\n<blockquote>\nThe reasoning in ''Macmillan'' cannot of course be understood without paying careful attention to the characterisation of the issue to which it was directed. Thus if transfer of shares may be effected only by registration on a particular register, the shares must inevitably be regarded as situate at the place where the register is kept for the purpose of ascertaining the efficacy of any purported transfer. However for the purpose of ascertaining the priority of competing proprietary or security interests falling short of registered ownership, only Auld LJ in the Court of Appeal seemed to regard the law of the place where the register is kept as significant \u2013 see [1996] 1 WLR 387 at 411E. In that case however the place of incorporation, the place where the share certificates were at the time of the relevant transactions and the place where the share register was kept were all the same, New York, so the point did not need to be decided.\n</blockquote>\n\nIn other words, the issue of situs depends upon the purpose.  For a transfer it is (or may well be) the place of the register.  But for the purposes of priority of title, it is the place of incorporation.  This also accords with some older judicial decisions such as ''Brassard v Smith'' [1925] AC 371 which indicated: \"there are ... so many qualities of a share which are attributable to different places it would seem to follow that there cannot be a proper local habitation for a share at all.\"\n\n==Criticism==\n\nThere have been various criticisms of the judgment, although not all of them are universally supported.\n* Certain academics were highly critical of the decision for its unceremonious rejection of the doctrine of ''[[renvoi]]''.<ref>Adrian Briggs, \u2018In Praise and Defence of Renvoi\u2019, (1998) 47 ICLQ 877</ref>  However other academics endorsed that as removing the \"onerous, expensive, and time-consuming\" enquiries that the doctrine results in.{{sfn|Ooi|p=7}}\n* In each case the judges entirely overlooked the fact that the relevant shares were held in a depository system, which most lawyers consider changes the nature of the property for choice of law

TO SHARES |publisher=LCMLQ |accessdate=25 February 2020}}</ref>  The issue arose in relation to frauds conducted by the late [[Robert Maxwell]].\n\nThe appeal was not actually an appeal on the full decision, but an appeal to determine a preliminary issue: specifically whether the proper law to determine the issue was [[English law]] or [[New York law]].  Macmillan argued that the main issue was a claim in restitution, and so the proper law to determine the issue was English law.  The respondent banks argued that the main issue was who had title to the shares, and so the proper law to determine that issue was New York law.\n\nThe trial at first instance on the full facts ([1995] 1 WLR 978, before [[Peter Millett, Baron Millett|Millet J]]) had taken \"the best part of a year, from October 1992 to July 1993\".<ref>[1996] 1 WLR 387 at 393B</ref>  The respondent banks won at first instance and upon appeal. \n\n==Facts==\n\nMacmillan Inc was a company incorporated in Delaware, and which was controlled by [[Robert Maxwell]]  It owned a majority shareholding in [[Berlitz Corporation|Berlitz International Inc]], a New York company.  Under the direction of Maxwell the shares in Berlitz were transferred to Bishopsgate Investments Trust plc (a company owned and controlled by Robert Maxwell and his family<ref>[1996] 1 WLR 387 at 394B</ref>) as its nominee.  Then, without MacMillan's consent or knowledge, the shares were mortgaged by Bishopsgate to secure loans from three different financial institutions to fund Maxwell's private interests.{{sfn|Ooi|p=3}}<ref name=LMCLQ />  Accordingly, although it was named as the first defendant in the action, Bishopsgate played little part - the main dispute was fought between Macmillan and the banks who had loaned money to Robert Maxwell on the strength of the Berlitz shares as [[Collateral (finance)|collateral]].\n\nThe central issue in the case was who had better title to the shares: MacMillan as beneficiary under a trust, or the financial institutions as mortgagees.  The key to determining these issues was deciding which was the proper law to determine title to the shares.  The only previous case relating to this issue (''Colonial Bank Ltd v Cady and Williams'' (1890) 15 App Cas 267) had been decided over a century before, followed by an \"astonishing period of legal barrenness in judicial and academic consideration\".{{sfn|Ooi|p=1}}  However in the present case the issue was complicated by the fact that many of the shares were held indirectly through a [[Central securities depository|securities depository]], [[Depository Trust Company]].\n\nAt first instance, after an extremely lengthy trial, Millet J held that the proper law to determine priority of claims was the ''[[lex loci contractus]]'' which was New York law.  Accordingly, the banks prevailed.  Macmillan appealed against the decision, and it was agreed to hear the appeal as to what the proper law to determine the issue was as a preliminary point.  The case was conducted largely under the assumption was that if New York law determined title, then the banks would win because they had no actual notice of wrongdoing.  But if English law determined title, then Macmillan had an arguable case that the banks had constructive notice of Robert Maxwell's fraud on the grounds they ought to have known he was engaging in fraud when he caused the shares to be mortgaged for the benefit of loans to his private businesses.\n\n==Judgment==\n\nAll three judges in the Court of Appeal gave reasoned decisions.  One of the most common criticisms of the decision is that although all three judges agreed as to the outcome (that New York law applied), they all gave different reasons - and all of their reasons were different from that of the trial judge.{{sfn|Ooi|p=6}}\n\n===Staughton LJ===\n\nThe first decision was given by [[Christopher Staughton|Staughton LJ]].  He indicated that in relation to a conflict of laws problem, the court essentially has a three-stage problem:\n<blockquote>\nThere are in essence three issues before us, corresponding to the three stages in a conflict case which I have mentioned.  They are: (a) how does one characterise the question in this action? (b) What connecting factor does our conflict rule provide for questions of that character? (c) What system of law does that connecting factor require to be applied?<ref>[1996] 1 WLR 387 at 393G</ref>\n</blockquote>\nHe then summarised the facts and reviewed the issues each in turn.\n\nIn relation to Stage 1 (characterisation), Macmillan contended the claim relating to restitution ([[unjust enrichment in English law|unjust enrichment]]), and so the issue should be decided in accordance with Rule 201, sub-rule (c) of [[Dicey Morris & Collins|Dicey & Morris]] (12th ed.).  In the context of this case, that would result in the application of English law, as the law of the place where the enrichment occurs.  However he rejected that characterisation - the issue was not whether the banks were enriched - it was whether they had a good defence to the return of the shares.  In that case it was not a question of characterising the claim, but characterising the core issue.<ref>[1996] 1 WLR 387 at 399C</ref>\n\nIn relation to Stage 2 (choice of law) he held that the relevant law was clearly that of the ''[[lex situs]]'' of the property, and cited various authorites in support including ''[[Winkworth v Christie Manson and Woods Ltd]]'' [1980] Ch 496 and ''[[Inglis v Robertson]]'' [1898] AC 616.  But he noted that those cases related to goods, and that the same rule applied in relation to negotiable instruments. However in relation to intangible property such as [[choses in action]], the usual rule was the priority was determined by the proper law of the chose in action, not its situs (citing Dicey & Morris (12th ed.), Rule 123).  He then considered whether shares have \"a rule of their own\".  He noted that the evidence of American law (as the law under which the company who issued the shares was incorporated), shares were not negotiable instruments (following ''Williams v Colonial Bank'' sub nom ''Cady'' (1888) 38 Ch D 388 at 403).  He reviewed ''Cady'' in some detail and confessed to finding it difficult to draw the boundaries between the issues being discussed.<ref>[1996] 1 WLR 387 at 404E</ref>  Then with slightly abrupt suddenness he held:\n<blockquote>\nI conclude that an issue as to who has title to the shares in a company should be decided by the law of the place where the shares are situated (lex situs).  ... and in this case, that is the law of the place where the company is incorporated.  There may be cases where it is arguably the law of the place where the share register is kept, but that problem does not arise today.  The reference is to the domestic law of the place in question; at one time there was an argument for renvoi, but mercifully (or sadly, as the case may be) that has been abandoned.<ref>[1996] 1 WLR 387 at 405B</ref>\n</blockquote>\nHe then went on to consider Stage 3 (system of law).  He held that \"[w]hether it be situs, place of incorporation or place of share register, the answer is the law of and prevailing in the State of New YOrk.\"<ref>[1996] 1 WLR 387 at 405C</ref>\n\n===Auld LJ===\n\nThe second (and shortest) judgment was given by [[Robin Auld|Auld LJ]].  He opened by summarising the issue as \"Who has the better right to ownership of shares in a corporation?\"<ref>[1996] 1 WLR 387 at 405C</ref>  He also noted that Macmillan framed this issue as a claim for restitution, but the banks asserted it was an issue of priority of claims in relation to an asset.  He reviewed the recent cases in what was called \"receipt-based restitutionary claims\" and referred to academic articles which cautioned about how new developments in domestic law should be treated when applying historical choice of law rules.<ref>Adrian Briggs, 'Restitution Meets the Conflict of Laws' [1995] RLR 94 at 97.</ref>  He noted that the usual rule in relation to property claims was to apply the lex situs, and then expresses doubts as to whether choice of law based on restitutionary claims is advisable in this case.  He noted that the claim for unjust enrichment was difficult in any event, as the banks gave full value.  He eventually concluded that \"even if the facts could support a claim for unjust enrichment, it is the issue that determiend the matter.  As I have said, it is essentially a proprietary one\".<ref>[1996] 1 WLR 387 at 409A</ref>  He rejected the view of the trial judge that the lex loci actus was applicable to the issue.\n\nTurning to the issue of what the lex situs of shares was, he review the authorities which he felt were unsatisfactory.  He stated that:\n<blockquote>\nIn my view, there is authority and much to be said for treating issues of priority of ownership of shares in a corporation according to the lex situs of those shares.  That will normally be the country where the register is kept, usually but not always the country of incorporation. If the shares are negotiable the lex situs will be where the pieces of paper constituting the negotiable instruments are at the time of transfer.<ref>[1996] 1 WLR 387 at 411D</ref>\n</blockquote>\nHe then also reviewed ''Cady'' and distinguished it.  He affirmed that the proper law to determine the issue was New York law.  Although he did not explicitly reject ''renvoi'' he stated that the proper law was \"the ''domestic'' law of New York.<ref>[1996] 1 WLR 387 at 413H (emphasis added)</ref>\n\n===Aldous LJ===\n\nThe third and final judgment was given by [[William Aldous|Aldous LJ]].<ref>Curiously counsel for one of the banks in the case was Richard Aldous QC, who was the brother of Aldous LJ.</ref>  After setting out the facts again in some detail, he also affirmed that Macmillan had argued its case on the basis that English law was the proper law to determine the issue as the issue before the court was one of restitution.  Conversely the banks argued that this was an issue as to who had the better priority to the shares as a matter of property law.  As with the other judges in the Court of Appeal, Aldous LJ felt that this was an issue of property law.  He held: \"The issue being one of priority, the law having the closest and most real connection must be New York law.  That is the law which governs the right in dispute, namely the right to be placed on the register.\"<ref>[1996] 1 WLR 387 at 419F</ref> He went on to expound:\n<blockquote>\nI have no doubt that the transferability of shares in a corporation, the formalities necessary to transfer them and the right of the transferee to be registered on the books of the corporation as the owner of the shares are all governed by the law of incorporation.<ref>[1996] 1 WLR 387 at 419H</ref>\n</blockquote>\nHe then proceeded with his own review of ''Cady'' (which he asserted supported his position).  He also cited a long string of North American decisions relating to the issue.  He then concluded: \"I believe the appropriate law to decide questions of title to property, such as shares, is the lex situs, which is the same as the law of incorporation.\"<ref>[1996] 1 WLR 387 at 424F</ref>\n\n===Overview===\n\nAlthough the case is often held up as being determinative of the lex situs of a share in a company, and/or as determining that the doctrine of ''[[renvoi]]'' does not apply to intangible property, neither of those points were actually in issue in the case.  Macmillan argued for an entirely separate choice of law issue relating to a different characerisation.  And the comments of the Court of Appeal in relation to the situs of shares all agreed that they were located in New York, but expressed somewhat different views as to why that was so.  The decision that renvoi was not applicable was similarly not argued, as both sides were content that any reference to a foreign law should solely be to the domestic law.  Similarly, neither party argued for a different choice of law rule on the basis that the shares were held through intermediaries rather than directly held.<ref>Maisi Ooi, \u2018Intermediation and its effect on investor rights\u2019 (2015) 131 LQR 536</ref>\n\nIn relation to whether different issues applied to shares that were negotiable, again the court did not speak with one voice.  Both Staughton and Auld LJJ expressed the view that negotiable shares were subject to a different choice of law rule - the law of the place where the relevant certificates were located.  But they differed in their judgments as to which law should determine whether shares were negotiable or not: Staughton LJ indicating it was the lex fori and Auld suggesting it was the law of the place where act of negotiation occurs.  Ooi rejects both as incorrect.{{sfn|Ooi|p=9}}<ref>It is clear that for at least some negotiable instruments, it will be the place of negotiation, see [[Bills of Exchange Act 1882]], section 72.</ref>  She favours the view of Aldous LJ who implies that the situs of a share, even when negotiable, is the place of the company's incorporation.{{sfn|Ooi|p=17}}\n\n==Reception==\n\nThe case broadly received a mixed reception from commentators.  It is accepted as authoritative in relation to its approach to characterisation.{{sfn|Cheshire|p=43}}{{sfn|Hill|p=19}}  However its rejection of renvoi is not seen as completely definitive.{{sfn|Cheshire|p=71}}{{sfn|Hill|p=34}}<ref>Relatively little argument was addressed to the Court of Appeal on renvoi. However renvoi was a live issue in the trial at first instance, and was rejected by Millet J (see first instance decision at [1995] 1 WLR 978 at 1008C-G).  Against that decision there was no appeal.</ref>  \n\nIn relation to the main subject for which the case is normally cited, the situs of shares in a company, [[Dicey Morris & Collins]] accept it as good authority, but note that it has to be read against a large group of cases which seek to impose a different situs in different situations for different purposes.{{sfn|Dicey|p=1296}}  Hill treats it as largely authoritative with respect to the choice of the lex situs, but refrains from commenting upon the identification of the situs for shares.{{sfn|Hill|p=483}}  In that regard it is hard to treat it as a definitive statement of the law.  Maisie Ooi in her definitive work on the subject expresses discomfort in relation to the parts of the judgment which refer to the situs of shares being determined by the place of the register.{{sfn|Ooi|p=6}}\n\n==Subsequent decisions==\n\nThe [[Supreme Court of the United Kingdom|Supreme Court]] endorsed the decision in {{cite bailii|litigants=[[Akers v Samba Financial Group]]|year=2017|court=UKSC|num=6}}.  Notably [[Jonathan Sumption, Lord Sumption|Lord Sumption]] summarised its effects as \"transmission of property is governed by the lex situs, which in the case of registered shares is the law of the company's incorporation... This proposition is well established and was not seriously disputed: see ''Macmillan Inc v Bishopsgate Investment Trust Plc (No 3)'' [1996] 1 WLR 387.\" (at para [80]).  [[Jonathan Mance, Baron Mance|Lord Mance]] also referred to the decision with approval, but did not comment specifically on the lex situs of shares.\n\nIn {{cite bailii|litigants=Dornoch Ltd v Westminster International BV |year=2009 |court=EWHC |num=889 |division=Admlty}} [[Stephen Tomlinson|Tomlinson J]] suggested that the conflicting decisions in ''Macmillan'' are misconstrued.  In his judgment he noted that:\n<blockquote>\nThe reasoning in ''Macmillan'' cannot of course be understood without paying careful attention to the characterisation of the issue to which it was directed. Thus if transfer of shares may be effected only by registration on a particular register, the shares must inevitably be regarded as situate at the place where the register is kept for the purpose of ascertaining the efficacy of any purported transfer. However for the purpose of ascertaining the priority of competing proprietary or security interests falling short of registered ownership, only Auld LJ in the Court of Appeal seemed to regard the law of the place where the register is kept as significant \u2013 see [1996] 1 WLR 387 at 411E. In that case however the place of incorporation, the place where the share certificates were at the time of the relevant transactions and the place where the share register was kept were all the same, New York, so the point did not need to be decided.\n</blockquote>\n\nIn other words, the issue of situs depends upon the purpose.  For a transfer it is (or may well be) the place of the register.  But for the purposes of priority of title, it is the place of incorporation.  This also accords with some older judicial decisions such as ''Brassard v Smith'' [1925] AC 371 which indicated: \"there are ... so many qualities of a share which are attributable to different places it would seem to follow that there cannot be a proper local habitation for a share at all.\"\n\n==Criticism==\n\nThere have been various criticisms of the judgment, although not all of them are universally supported.\n* Certain academics were highly critical of the decision for its unceremonious rejection of the doctrine of ''[[renvoi]]''.<ref>Adrian Briggs, \u2018In Praise and Defence of Renvoi\u2019, (1998) 47 ICLQ 877</ref>  However other academics endorsed that as removing the \"onerous, expensive, and time-consuming\" enquiries that the doctrine results in.{{sfn|Ooi|p=7}}\n* In each case the judges entirely overlooked the fact that the relevant shares were held in a depository system, which most lawyers consider changes the nature of the property for choice of law purposes.{{sfn|Dicey|p=1366}}{{sfn|Ooi|p=87}}  However, this may be because of the way that the case was pleaded and argued.<ref>In the next round of the litigation Macmillan did argue for a different choice of law rule based on the fact the shares were held by intermediaries: {{cite bailii|litigants=Macmillan Inc v Bishopsgate Investment Trust plc (No 4) |year=1998 |court=EWCA |division=Civ |num=1680}}</ref>\n* But the most common criticism is that in reach three different analyses which led to the same result, it is extremely difficult to tell what the authoritative ''[[ratio decidendi]]'' of the case is.{{sfn|Dicey|p=1295}}{{sfn|Ooi|p=6}}\n\n==Footnotes==\n\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==Sources==\n\n* {{cite book |last=Collins |first=Lawrence |title=Dicey, Morris & Collins: The Conflict of Laws |publisher=[[Sweet & Maxwell]] |year=2012 |edition=15th |isbn=978-0-414-02453-3 |ref={{sfnRef|Dicey}}}}\n* {{cite book |last=Hill |first=Jonathan |title=Clarkson & Hill's Conflict of Laws |publisher=[[Oxford University Press|OUP]] |year=2016 |edition=5th |isbn=978-0-19-873229-7 |ref={{sfnRef|Hill}}}}\n* {{cite book |last=Ooi |first=Maisie |title=Shares and Other Securities in the Conflict of Laws |publisher=[[Oxford University Press|OUP]] |year=2003 |edition= |isbn=0-19-925613-6 |ref={{sfnRef|Ooi}}}}\n* {{cite book |last=Torremans |first=Paul |title=Cheshire, North & Fawcett: Private International Law |publisher=[[Oxford University Press|OUP]] |year=2017 |edition=15th |isbn=978-0-19-967899-0 |ref={{sfnRef|Cheshire}}}}\n\n==See also==\n*''[[Bishopsgate Investment Management Ltd v Maxwell (No 2)]]'' [1993] BCLC 814\n\n{{italic title|all=yes|noerror}}\n\n[[Category:English trusts case law]]\n[[Category:Court of Appeal of England and Wales cases]]\n[[Category:1995 in case law]]\n[[Category:1995 in British law]]\n", "name_user": "WereSpielChequers", "label": "safe", "comment": "Typo fixing, replaced: choses \u2192 chooses,typo(s) fixed: However  \u2192 However,  (2), authorites \u2192 authorities", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Macmillan_Inc_v_Bishopsgate_Investment_Trust_plc_(No_3)"}
