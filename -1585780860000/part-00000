After the secession of the [[Irish Free State]] in 1922, the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland changed its name to the [[United Kingdom|United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland]].}} Colonization efforts began in the late 16th century with unsuccessful efforts by the Kingdom of England to establish colonies in [[North America]], but the first permanent English colony was established in [[Jamestown, Virginia|Jamestown]] in 1607.<ref>Taylor (2002), pp. 117-137</ref><ref>Horn (2011), pp. 241-243</ref> Over the next several centuries more colonies were established in the Americas.

Historians sometimes refer to the British Empire after 1783 as the \"Second British Empire\"; this period saw Britain increasingly focus on Asia and Africa instead of the Americas, and increasingly focus on the expansion of trade rather than territorial possessions. Nonetheless, Britain continued to colonize parts of the Americas in the 19th century, taking control of [[British Columbia]] and establishing the colonies of the [[Falkland Islands]] and [[British Honduras]]. Britain also gained control of several colonies, including [[Trinidad]] and [[British Guiana]], following the defeat of France in the [[Napoleonic Wars]].\n\nIn the mid-19th century, Britain began the process of granting self-government to its remaining colonies in North America. Most of these colonies joined the Confederation of [[Canada]] in the 1860s or 1870s, though [[Newfoundland]] would not join Canada until 1949. Canada gained full autonomy following the passage of the [[Statute of Westminster 1931]], though it retained various ties to Britain and still recognizes the British monarch as [[head of state]]. Following the onset of the [[Cold War]] most of the remaining British colonies in the Americas gained independence between 1962 and 1983. Many of the former British colonies are part of the [[Commonwealth of Nations]], a political association chiefly consisting of former colonies of the British Empire.\n\n==Background: early exploration and colonization of the Americas==\n{{Further|Pre-Columbian era|Age of Discovery|European colonization of the Americas}}\n[[File:Spanish Empire in 1598.png|thumb|upright=1.0|By the end of the 16th century, the [[Iberian Union]] of [[Spain]] and [[Portugal]] had colonized much of the [[Americas]], but other parts of the Americas had not yet been colonized by European powers]]\n\nFollowing the first voyage of [[Christopher Columbus]] in 1492, [[Spain]] and [[Portugal]] established colonies in the [[New World]], beginning the [[European colonization of the Americas]].<ref>Richter (2011), pp. 69-70</ref> [[France]] and [[England]], the two other major powers of 15th-century [[Western Europe]], employed explorers soon after the return of Columbus's first voyage. In 1497, King [[Henry VII of England|Henry VII]] of England dispatched an expedition led by [[John Cabot]] to explore the coast of North America, but the lack of precious metals or other riches discouraged both the Spanish and English from permanently settling in North America during the early 16th century.<ref>Richter (2011), pp. 83-85</ref> Later explorers such as [[Martin Frobisher]] and [[Henry Hudson]] sailed to the New World in search of a [[Northwest Passage]] between the Atlantic Ocean and Asia, but were unable to find a viable route.<ref>Richter (2011), pp. 121-123</ref> Europeans established [[Cod fishing in Newfoundland|fisheries]] in the [[Grand Banks of Newfoundland]], and traded metal, glass, and cloth for food and fur, beginning the [[North American fur trade]].<ref>Richter (2011), pp. 129-130</ref> During the Summer and Autumn of 1585 [[Bernard Drake]] launched an [[Newfoundland expedition (1585)|expedition to Newfoundland]] which crippled the Spanish and Portuguese fishing fleets there from which they never recovered from. This would have consequences in terms of English colonial expansion and settlement. Meanwhile, in the [[Caribbean Sea]], English sailors defied Spanish trade restrictions and preyed on [[Spanish treasure fleet|Spanish treasure ships]].<ref>James (1997), pp. 16\u201317</ref>\n\nIn the late sixteenth century, [[Protestant]] England became embroiled in a [[Anglo-Spanish War (1585\u20131604)|religious war]] with [[Catholicism|Catholic]] Spain. Seeking to weaken Spain's economic and military power, English [[privateer]]s such as [[Francis Drake]] and [[Humphrey Gilbert]] harassed Spanish shipping.<ref>Richter (2011), pp. 98-100</ref> Gilbert proposed the colonization of North America on the Spanish model, with the goal of creating a profitable English empire that could also serve as a base for the privateers. After Gilbert's death, [[Walter Raleigh]] took up the cause of North American colonization, sponsoring an expedition of 500 men to [[Roanoke Island]]. In 1584, the colonists established the first permanent English colony in North America,<ref>Richter (2011), pp. 100-102</ref> but the colonists were poorly prepared for life in the New World, and by 1590, the colonists had disappeared.<ref>Richter (2011), pp. 103-107</ref> A separate colonization attempt in [[Newfoundland]] also failed.<ref>James (1997), p. 5</ref> Despite the failure of these early colonies, the English remained interested in the colonization of North America for economic and military reasons.<ref>Richter (2011), p. 112</ref>\n\n==Early colonization, 1607\u20131630==\n{{Further|English overseas possessions}}\n[[File:James I of England 404446.jpg|thumb|Jamestown, the first permanent English settlement in North America, was established during the reign of King [[James VI and I|James I of England]]]]\n\nIn 1606, King [[James VI and I|James I of England]] granted charters to both the [[Plymouth Company]] and the [[London Company]] for the purpose of establishing permanent settlements in North America. In 1607, the London Company established a permanent colony at [[Jamestown, Virginia|Jamestown]] on the [[Chesapeake Bay]], but the Plymouth Company's [[Popham Colony]] proved short-lived. The colonists at Jamestown faced extreme adversity, and by 1617 there were only 351 survivors out of the 1700 colonists who had been transported to Jamestown.<ref>Richter (2011), pp. 113-115</ref> After the Virginians discovered the profitability of growing [[tobacco]], the settlement's population boomed from 400 settlers in 1617 to 1240 settlers in 1622.

Historians sometimes refer to the British Empire after 1783 as the \"Second British Empire\"; this period saw Britain increasingly focus on Asia and Africa instead of the Americas, and increasingly focus on the expansion of trade rather than territorial possessions. Nonetheless, Britain continued to colonize parts of the Americas in the 19th century, taking control of [[British Columbia]] and establishing the colonies of the [[Falkland Islands]] and [[British Honduras]]. Britain also gained control of several colonies, including [[Trinidad]] and [[British Guiana]], following the defeat of France in the [[Napoleonic Wars]].\n\nIn the mid-19th century, Britain began the process of granting self-government to its remaining colonies in North America. Most of these colonies joined the Confederation of [[Canada]] in the 1860s or 1870s, though [[Newfoundland]] would not join Canada until 1949. Canada gained full autonomy following the passage of the [[Statute of Westminster 1931]], though it retained various ties to Britain and still recognizes the British monarch as [[head of state]]. Following the onset of the [[Cold War]] most of the remaining British colonies in the Americas gained independence between 1962 and 1983. Many of the former British colonies are part of the [[Commonwealth of Nations]], a political association chiefly consisting of former colonies of the British Empire.\n\n==Background: early exploration and colonization of the Americas==\n{{Further|Pre-Columbian era|Age of Discovery|European colonization of the Americas}}\n[[File:Spanish Empire in 1598.png|thumb|upright=1.0|By the end of the 16th century, the [[Iberian Union]] of [[Spain]] and [[Portugal]] had colonized much of the [[Americas]], but other parts of the Americas had not yet been colonized by European powers]]\n\nFollowing the first voyage of [[Christopher Columbus]] in 1492, [[Spain]] and [[Portugal]] established colonies in the [[New World]], beginning the [[European colonization of the Americas]].<ref>Richter (2011), pp. 69-70</ref> [[France]] and [[England]], the two other major powers of 15th-century [[Western Europe]], employed explorers soon after the return of Columbus's first voyage. In 1497, King [[Henry VII of England|Henry VII]] of England dispatched an expedition led by [[John Cabot]] to explore the coast of North America, but the lack of precious metals or other riches discouraged both the Spanish and English from permanently settling in North America during the early 16th century.<ref>Richter (2011), pp. 83-85</ref> Later explorers such as [[Martin Frobisher]] and [[Henry Hudson]] sailed to the New World in search of a [[Northwest Passage]] between the Atlantic Ocean and Asia, but were unable to find a viable route.<ref>Richter (2011), pp. 121-123</ref> Europeans established [[Cod fishing in Newfoundland|fisheries]] in the [[Grand Banks of Newfoundland]], and traded metal, glass, and cloth for food and fur, beginning the [[North American fur trade]].<ref>Richter (2011), pp. 129-130</ref> During the Summer and Autumn of 1585 [[Bernard Drake]] launched an [[Newfoundland expedition (1585)|expedition to Newfoundland]] which crippled the Spanish and Portuguese fishing fleets there from which they never recovered from. This would have consequences in terms of English colonial expansion and settlement. Meanwhile, in the [[Caribbean Sea]], English sailors defied Spanish trade restrictions and preyed on [[Spanish treasure fleet|Spanish treasure ships]].<ref>James (1997), pp. 16\u201317</ref>\n\nIn the late sixteenth century, [[Protestant]] England became embroiled in a [[Anglo-Spanish War (1585\u20131604)|religious war]] with [[Catholicism|Catholic]] Spain. Seeking to weaken Spain's economic and military power, English [[privateer]]s such as [[Francis Drake]] and [[Humphrey Gilbert]] harassed Spanish shipping.<ref>Richter (2011), pp. 98-100</ref> Gilbert proposed the colonization of North America on the Spanish model, with the goal of creating a profitable English empire that could also serve as a base for the privateers. After Gilbert's death, [[Walter Raleigh]] took up the cause of North American colonization, sponsoring an expedition of 500 men to [[Roanoke Island]]. In 1584, the colonists established the first permanent English colony in North America,<ref>Richter (2011), pp. 100-102</ref> but the colonists were poorly prepared for life in the New World, and by 1590, the colonists had disappeared.<ref>Richter (2011), pp. 103-107</ref> A separate colonization attempt in [[Newfoundland]] also failed.<ref>James (1997), p. 5</ref> Despite the failure of these early colonies, the English remained interested in the colonization of North America for economic and military reasons.<ref>Richter (2011), p. 112</ref>\n\n==Early colonization, 1607\u20131630==\n{{Further|English overseas possessions}}\n[[File:James I of England 404446.jpg|thumb|Jamestown, the first permanent English settlement in North America, was established during the reign of King [[James VI and I|James I of England]]]]\n\nIn 1606, King [[James VI and I|James I of England]] granted charters to both the [[Plymouth Company]] and the [[London Company]] for the purpose of establishing permanent settlements in North America. In 1607, the London Company established a permanent colony at [[Jamestown, Virginia|Jamestown]] on the [[Chesapeake Bay]], but the Plymouth Company's [[Popham Colony]] proved short-lived. The colonists at Jamestown faced extreme adversity, and by 1617 there were only 351 survivors out of the 1700 colonists who had been transported to Jamestown.<ref>Richter (2011), pp. 113-115</ref> After the Virginians discovered the profitability of growing [[tobacco]], the settlement's population boomed from 400 settlers in 1617 to 1240 settlers in 1622.

The Pilgrims endured an extremely hard first winter, with roughly fifty of the one hundred colonists dying.

British authorities initially planned for a three-decades-long process in which each colony would develop a self-governing and democratic parliament, but unrest and fears of Communist infiltration in the colonies encouraged the British to speed up the move towards self-governance.<ref>James (1997), p. 538\u2013539</ref> Compared to other European empires, which experienced wars of independence such as the [[Algerian War]] and the [[Portuguese Colonial War]], the British post-war process of decolonization in the Caribbean and elsewhere was relatively peaceful.<ref>James (1997), pp. 588\u2013589</ref>\n\nIn an attempt to unite its Caribbean colonies, Britain established the [[West Indies Federation]] in 1958.

However, contemporary Malaysia regards the entire History of Malaya, spanning thousands of years back to Prehistoric times, as its own history, and as such it is treated in this page.\n\nAn early western account of the area is seen in Ptolemy's book ''[[Geography (Ptolemy)|Geographia]],'' which mentions a \"[[Golden Chersonese|Golden Khersonese]],\" now identified as the [[Malay Peninsula]].<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=2zZCAAAAIAAJ&pg=PA71&dq=%22Golden+Chersonese%22+malay#v=onepage|title=Imago Mvndi|year=1958|publisher=Brill Archive|language=en}}</ref> [[Hinduism]] and [[Buddhism]] from [[India]] and [[China]] dominated early regional history, reaching their peak during the reign of the [[Sumatra]]-based [[Srivijaya]] civilisation, whose influence extended through [[Sumatra]], [[Java]], the [[Malay Peninsula]] and much of [[Borneo]] from the 7th to the 13th centuries.\n\nAlthough Muslims had passed through the [[Malay Peninsula]] as early as the 10th century, it was not until the 14th century that [[Islam]] first firmly established itself. The adoption of Islam in the 14th century saw the rise of a number of sultanates, the most prominent of which was the [[Sultanate of Malacca]]. Islam had a profound influence on the [[Malay people]], but has also been influenced by them. The [[Portugal|Portuguese]] were the first European colonial powers to establish themselves on the Malay Peninsula and [[Southeast Asia]], capturing Malacca in 1511, followed by the Dutch in 1641. However, it was the British who, after initially establishing bases at [[Jesselton]], [[Kuching]], [[Penang]] and [[Singapore]], ultimately secured their hegemony across the territory that is now Malaysia. The [[Anglo-Dutch Treaty of 1824]] defined the boundaries between [[British Malaya]] and the [[Netherlands East Indies]] (which became Indonesia). A fourth phase of foreign influence was immigration of Chinese and Indian workers to meet the needs of the colonial economy created by the British in the Malay Peninsula and Borneo.<ref>Annual Report on the Federation of Malaya: 1951 in C.C. Chin and Karl Hack, Dialogues with Chin Peng pp. 380, 81.</ref>\n\nJapanese invasion during [[World War II]] ended British domination in Malaysia. [[Japanese occupation of Malaya|The subsequent occupation of Malaya]], [[Japanese occupation of British Borneo|North Borneo and Sarawak]] from 1942 to 1945 unleashed nationalism.

Malaya's obvious attractions were its [[tin]] and [[gold]] mines, but British planters soon began to experiment with tropical plantation crops\u2014[[tapioca]], [[uncaria|gambier]], pepper, and coffee. But in 1877 the rubber plant was introduced from [[Brazil]], and [[rubber]] soon became Malaya's staple export, stimulated by booming demand from European industry. Rubber was later joined by [[palm oil]] as an export earner. All these industries required a large and disciplined [[Labor force|labour force]], and the British did not regard the Malays as reliable workers. The solution was the importation of plantation workers from India, mainly [[Tamil language|Tamil]]-speakers from [[South India]]. A small group of Malabaris were brought from the current place called Kerala to help with the rubber plantations, resulting in the small Malabari population seen in Malaysia today. The mines, mills and docks also attracted a flood of immigrant workers from southern China. Soon towns like Singapore, Penang, and [[Ipoh]] were majority Chinese, as was [[Kuala Lumpur]], founded as a tin-mining centre in 1857. By 1891, when Malaya's first census was taken, Perak and Selangor, the main tin-mining states, had Chinese majorities.<ref>Hays, Jeffrey. \u201cBRITISH IN MALAYSIA.\u201d Facts and Details, https://factsanddetails.com/southeast-asia/Malaysia/sub5_4a/entry-3619.html#chapter-5.</ref>\n\nThe Chinese mostly arrived poor; yet their belief in industriousness and frugality, their emphasis in their children's education and their maintenance of Confucian family hierarchy, as well as their voluntary connection with tightly knit networks of [[Benefit society|mutual aid societies]] (run by \"Hui-Guan\" \u6703\u9928, or non-profit organisations with nominal geographic affiliations from different parts of China) all contributed to their prosperity. In the 1890s [[Yap Ah Loy]], who held the title of Kapitan China of Kuala Lumpur, was the richest man in Malaya, owning a chain of mines, plantations and shops. Malaya's banking and insurance industries were run by the Chinese from the start, and Chinese businesses, usually in partnership with London firms, soon had a stranglehold on the economy. Since the Malay Sultans tended to spend well beyond their means, they were soon indebted to Chinese bankers, and this gave the Chinese political as well as economic leverage. At first the Chinese immigrants were mostly men, and many intended to return home when they had made their fortunes. Many did go home, but many more stayed. At first they married Malay women, producing a community of Sino-Malayans or [[Peranakan|baba]] people, but soon they began importing Chinese brides, establishing permanent communities and building schools and temples.\n\nThe Indians were initially less successful, since unlike the Chinese they came mainly as indentured labourers to work in the rubber plantations, and had few of the economic opportunities that the Chinese had. They were also a less united community, since they were divided between Hindus and Muslims and along lines of language and [[caste]]. An Indian commercial and [[professional class]] emerged during the early 20th century, but the majority of Indians remained poor and uneducated in [[rural ghetto]]s in the rubber-growing areas.\n\nTraditional Malay society had great difficulty coping with both the loss of political sovereignty to the British and of economic power to the Chinese. By the early 20th century it seemed possible that the Malays would become a minority in their own country. The Sultans, who were seen as collaborators with both the British and the Chinese, lost some of their traditional prestige, particularly among the increasing number of Malays with a western education, but the mass of rural Malays continued to revere the Sultans and their prestige was thus an important prop for [[Colonialism|colonial rule]]. A small class of Malay nationalist intellectuals began to emerge during the early 20th century, and there was also a revival of Islam in response to the perceived threat of other imported religions, particularly Christianity. In fact few Malays [[Christianization|converted to Christianity]], although many Chinese did. The northern regions, which were less influenced by western ideas, became strongholds of Islamic conservatism, as they have remained.\n\nThe one consolation to Malay pride was that the British allowed them a virtual monopoly of positions in the police and local [[military unit]]s, as well as a majority of those administrative positions open to non-Europeans. While the Chinese mostly built and paid for their own schools and colleges, importing teachers from China, the colonial government fostered education for Malays, opening [[Malay College Kuala Kangsar|Malay College]] in 1905 and creating the Malay Administrative Service in 1910. (The college was dubbed \u201cBab ud-Darajat\u201d \u2013 the Gateway to High Rank.) [[Universiti Pendidikan Sultan Idris|A Malay Teachers College]] followed in 1922, and a Malay Women's Training College in 1935. All this reflected the official British policy that Malaya belonged to the Malays, and that the other races were but temporary residents. This view was increasingly out of line with reality, and contained the seeds of much future trouble.\n\nThe Malay teacher's college had lectures and writings that nurtured [[Early Malay nationalism|Malay nationalism]] and anti-colonialist sentiments. Due to this it is known as the birthplace of [[early Malay nationalism|Malay nationalism]].<ref name=\"KBSM F2\">{{cite book|pages=208\u2013209|title=Kurikulum Bersepadu Sekolah Menengah Sejarah Tingkatan 2.|author=Zainal Abidin bin Abdul Wahid |author2=[[Khoo Kay Kim|Khoo, Kay Kim]] |author3=Muhd Yusof bin Ibrahim |author4=Singh, D.S.

It was the first nationalist political organisation in British Malaya, advocating for the union of all Malays regardless of origin, and fighting for Malay rights and against British Imperialism. A specific ideal the KMM held was ''Panji Melayu Raya'', which called for the unification of British Malaya and [[Dutch East Indies]].<ref name=\"KBSM F2\"/>\n\nIn the years before [[World War II]], the British were concerned with finding the balance between a centralised state and maintaining the power of the Sultans in Malaya.<ref name=\"History\"/> There were no moves to give Malaya a unitary government, and in fact in 1935 the position of Resident-General of the Federated States was abolished, and its powers decentralised to the individual states. With their usual tendency to racial stereotyping, the British regarded the Malays as amiable but unsophisticated and rather lazy, incapable of self-government, although making good soldiers under British officers. They regarded the Chinese as clever but dangerous\u2014and indeed during the 1920s and 1930s, reflecting events in China, the Chinese Nationalist Party (the [[Kuomintang]]) and the [[Communist Party of China]] built rival clandestine organisations in Malaya, leading to regular disturbances in the Chinese towns. The British saw no way that Malaya's disparate collection of states and races could become a nation, let alone an independent one.\n\n==War and emergency==\n[[File:Tugu Negara.jpg|thumb|right|''[[Tugu Negara]]'', the Malaysian national monument is dedicated to those who fell during World War II and the Malayan Emergency.]]\nAlthough a belligerent as part of the British Empire, Malaya saw little action during [[World War I]], except for the sinking of the [[Russian cruiser Zhemchug]] by the German cruiser [[SMS Emden]] on 28 October 1914 during the [[Battle of Penang]].\n\n[[Image:Lot-2651-2 (34230021050).jpg|thumb|right|Japanese troops landed on Malaya in 1941]]\nThe [[World War II|outbreak of war]] in [[Pacific theatre of World War II|the Pacific]] in December 1941 found the British in Malaya completely unprepared. During the 1930s, anticipating the rising threat of Japanese naval power, they had built a great naval base at Singapore, but never anticipated an invasion of Malaya from the north. Because of the demands of the war in Europe, there was virtually no British air capacity in the Far East. The Japanese were thus able to attack from their bases in [[French Indo-China]] with impunity, and despite stubborn resistance from British, Australian, and Indian forces, they [[Japanese invasion of Malaya|overran Malaya]] in two months. Singapore, with no landward defences, no air cover, and no [[water supply]], was forced to surrender in February 1942, doing irreparable damage to British prestige. British North Borneo and Brunei were also occupied.\n\nThe Japanese had a racial policy just as the British did. They regarded the Malays as a colonial people liberated from British imperialist rule, and fostered a limited form of Malay nationalism, which gained them some degree of collaboration from the Malay civil service and intellectuals. (Most of the Sultans also collaborated with the Japanese, although they maintained later that they had done so unwillingly.){{Citation needed|date=September 2012}} The Malay nationalist Kesatuan Melayu Muda, advocates of ''[[Melayu Raya]]'', collaborated with the Japanese, based on the understanding that Japan would unite the Dutch East Indies, Malaya and Borneo and grant them independence.<ref name=\"Graham\">{{cite journal|first=Brown |last=Graham |title=The Formation and Management of Political Identities: Indonesia and Malaysia Compared |publisher=Centre for Research on Inequality, Human Security and Ethnicity, CRISE, University of Oxford |date=February 2005 |url=http://www.crise.ox.ac.uk/pubs/workingpaper10.pdf |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120210163849/http://www.crise.ox.ac.uk/pubs/workingpaper10.pdf |archivedate=10 February 2012 }}</ref> The occupiers regarded the Chinese, however, as [[enemy alien]]s, and treated them with great harshness: during the so-called ''[[Sook Ching massacre|sook ching]]'' (purification through suffering), up to 80,000 Chinese in Malaya and Singapore were killed. Chinese businesses were expropriated and Chinese schools either closed or burned down. Not surprisingly the Chinese, led by the [[Malayan Communist Party]] (MCP), became the backbone of the [[Malayan Peoples' Anti-Japanese Army]] (MPAJA), a force similar to the Soviet-supported [[Partisan (military)|Partisan]] rebel forces led by local Communist parties in the Eastern European theatre. With British assistance, the MPAJA became the most effective resistance force in the occupied Asian countries.\n\nAlthough the Japanese argued that they supported Malay nationalism, they offended Malay nationalism by allowing their ally [[Thailand]] to re-annex the four northern states, Kedah, Perlis, Kelantan, and Terengganu that had been surrendered to the British in 1909.

Colonial self-rule and eventual independence were now British policy. The tide of colonial nationalism sweeping through Asia soon reached Malaya. But most Malays were more concerned with defending themselves against the MCP which was mostly made up of Chinese, than with demanding independence from the British; indeed, their immediate concern was that the British not leave and abandon the Malays to the armed Communists of the MPAJA, which was the largest armed force in the country.\n\n[[File:Japanese troops mopping up in Kuala Lumpur.jpg|thumb|left|Japanese troops moving through Kuala Lumpur during their advance through Malaya.]]<!-- Found here: http://www.iwmcollections.org.uk/dbtw-wpd/exec/dbtwpub.dll?AC=GET_RECORD&XC=/dbtw-wpd/exec/dbtwpub.dll&BU=http://www.iwmcollections.org.uk/qryPhotoImg.php&TN=Uncat&SN=AUTO9448&SE=565&RN=0&MR=25&TR=0&TX=1000&ES=0&CS=1&XP=&RF=phoResults&EF=&DF=phoDetails&RL=0&EL=0&DL=0&NP=1&ID=&MF=WPENGMSG.INI&MQ=&TI=0&DT=&ST=0&IR=162462&NR=0&NB=0&SV=0&BG=0&FG=0&QS= -->\n\nIn 1944, the British drew up plans for a [[Malayan Union]], which would turn the Federated and Unfederated Malay States, plus Penang and Malacca (but not Singapore), into a single Crown colony, with a view towards independence.

Faced with implacable Malay opposition, the British dropped the plan for equal citizenship. The Malayan Union was thus established in 1946, and was dissolved in 1948 and replaced by the [[Federation of Malaya]], which restored the autonomy of the rulers of the Malay states under British protection.\n\nMeanwhile, the Communists were moving towards open insurrection. The MPAJA had been disbanded in December 1945, and the MCP organised as a legal political party, but the MPAJA's arms were carefully stored for future use. The MCP policy was for immediate independence with full equality for all races. This meant it recruited very few Malays. The Party's strength was in the Chinese-dominated trade unions, particularly in Singapore, and in the Chinese schools, where the teachers, mostly born in China, saw the [[Communist Party of China]] as the leader of China's [[Romantic nationalism|national revival]]. In March 1947, reflecting the international Communist movement's \u201cturn to left\u201d as the [[Cold War]] set in, the MCP leader [[Lai Tek]] was purged and replaced by the veteran MPAJA guerrilla leader [[Chin Peng]], who turned the party increasingly to [[direct action]]. These rebels, under the leadership of the MCP, launched guerrilla operations designed to force the British out of Malaya. In July, following a string of assassinations of plantation managers, the colonial government struck back, declaring a [[State of emergency|State of Emergency]], banning the MCP and arresting hundreds of its militants. The Party retreated to the jungle and formed the [[Malayan Peoples\u2019 Liberation Army]], with about 13,000 men under arms, all Chinese.\n\nThe [[Malayan Emergency]] as it was known, lasted from 1948 to 1960 and involved a long anti-insurgency campaign by [[Commonwealth of Nations|Commonwealth]] troops in Malaya. The British strategy, which proved ultimately successful, was to isolate the MCP from its support base by a combination of economic and [[concession (politics)|political concessions]] to the Chinese and the resettlement of Chinese squatters into \u201cNew Villages\u201d in \u201cwhite areas\u201d free of MCP influence.

Although the MCP succeeded in assassinating the British [[High Commissioner]], Sir [[Henry Gurney]], in October 1951, this turn to terrorist tactics alienated many moderate Chinese from the Party. The arrival of Lt.-Gen Sir [[Gerald Templer]] as British commander in 1952 was the beginning of the end of the Emergency. Templer invented the techniques of [[counter-insurgency]] warfare in Malaya and applied them ruthlessly. Although the insurgency was defeated Commonwealth troops remained with the backdrop of the [[Cold War]].<ref>[http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,826360,00.html \"Malaya: Siege's End\"], ''Time'', New York, 2 May 1960.</ref> Against this backdrop, [[Hari Merdeka|independence]] for the Federation within the Commonwealth was granted on 31 August 1957,<ref name=\"TIME New Nation\">[http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,893616,00.html \"A New Nation\"], ''Time'', New York, 9 September 1957</ref> with [[Tunku Abdul Rahman]] as the first prime minister.<ref name=\"state.gov\"/>\n\n==Towards Malaysia==\n[[File:Dataran Merdeka.jpg|thumb|[[Dataran Merdeka]] (Independence Square) in Kuala Lumpur, where Malaysians celebrate Independence Day on 31 August each year.]]\nChinese reaction against the MCP was shown by the formation of the [[Malaysian Chinese Association|Malayan Chinese Association]] (MCA) in 1949 as a vehicle for moderate Chinese political opinion. Its leader [[Tan Cheng Lock]] favoured a policy of collaboration with UMNO to win Malayan independence on a policy of equal citizenship, but with sufficient concessions to Malay sensitivities to ease nationalist fears. Tan formed a close collaboration with Tunku (Prince) [[Tunku Abdul Rahman|Abdul Rahman]], the Chief Minister of [[Kedah]] and from 1951 successor to Datuk Onn as leader of UMNO. Since the British had announced in 1949 that Malaya would soon become independent whether the Malayans liked it or not, both leaders were determined to forge an agreement their communities could live with as a basis for a stable independent state. The UMNO-MCA Alliance, which was later joined by the [[Malaysian Indian Congress|Malayan Indian Congress]] (MIC), won convincing victories in local and state elections in both Malay and Chinese areas between 1952 and 1955.<ref name=\"Federation of Malaya Agreement\">''See'': {{Wikisource-inline|Federation of Malaya Agreement}}</ref>\n\nThe introduction of elected local government was another important step in defeating the Communists. After [[Joseph Stalin]]\u2019s death in 1953, there was a split in the MCP leadership over the wisdom of continuing the armed struggle. Many MCP militants lost heart and went home, and by the time Templer left Malaya in 1954, the Emergency was over, although [[Chin Peng]] led a diehard group that lurked in the inaccessible country along the Thai border for many years.\n\nDuring 1955 and 1956 UMNO, the MCA and the British hammered out a constitutional settlement for a principle of equal citizenship for all races. In exchange, the MCA agreed that [[Yang di-Pertuan Agong|Malaya's head of state]] would be drawn from the ranks of the Malay Sultans, that [[Malay language|Malay]] would be the official language, and that Malay education and [[economic development]] would be promoted and subsidised. In effect, this meant that Malaya would be run by the Malays, particularly since they continued to dominate the civil service, the army and the police, but that the Chinese and Indians would have proportionate representation in the Cabinet and the parliament, would run those states where they were the majority, and would have their economic position protected. The difficult issue of who would control the [[Education|education system]] was deferred until after independence. This came on 31 August 1957, when [[Tunku Abdul Rahman]] became the first Prime Minister of independent Malaya.\n\nThis left the unfinished business of the other British-ruled territories in the region. After the [[Surrender of Japan|Japanese surrender]] the [[Brooke family]] and the British North Borneo Company gave up their control of Sarawak and North Borneo respectively, and these became British Crown Colonies. They were much less economically developed than Malaya, and their local political leaderships were too weak to demand independence. Singapore, with its large Chinese majority, achieved autonomy in 1955, and in 1959 the young leader [[Lee Kuan Yew]] became Prime Minister. The [[Sultan of Brunei]] remained as a British client in his oil-rich enclave. Between 1959 and 1962 the [[Her Majesty's Government|British government]] orchestrated complex negotiations between these local leaders and the Malayan government.\n\nOn 24 April 1961, Lee Kuan Yew proposed the idea of forming Malaysia during a meeting to Tunku Abdul Rahman, after which Tunku invited Lee to prepare a paper elaborating on this idea. On 9 May, Lee sent the final version of the paper to Tunku and then deputy Malayan Prime Minister [[Abdul Razak Hussein|Abdul Razak]]. There were doubts about the practicality of the idea but Lee assured the Malayan government of continued Malay political dominance in the new federation. Razak supported the idea of the new federation and worked to convince Tunku to back it.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Stockwell|first1=AJ|title=British documents of the end of empire Series B Volume 8 \u2013 \"Paper on the future of the Federation of Malaya, Singapore, and Borneo Territories\":memorandum by Lee Kuan Yew for the government of the Federation of Malaya (CO1030/973, no E203)|date=2004|publisher=Institute of Commonwealth Studies|location=University of London|isbn=0112905811|page=108|url=https://archive.org/details/205722212TheMakingOfTheFederationOfMalaysia|accessdate=27 May 2015|quote=On 24 Apr Lee Kuan Yew informed Selkirk that on the previous day he had spoken to the Tunku for the first time about the Grand Design.}}</ref> On 27 May 1961, Abdul Rahman proposed the idea of forming \"Malaysia\", which would consist of [[Brunei]], [[Federation of Malaya|Malaya]], [[Crown Colony of North Borneo|North Borneo]], [[Crown Colony of Sarawak|Sarawak]], and [[Colony of Singapore|Singapore]], all except Malaya still under British rule.<ref>{{cite news|last1=JC|first1=Fong|title=Formation of Malaysia|url=http://www.theborneopost.com/2011/09/16/formation-of-malaysia/|accessdate=27 May 2015|newspaper=The Borneo Post|date=16 September 2011|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140716175727/http://www.theborneopost.com/2011/09/16/formation-of-malaysia/|archivedate=16 July 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Tunku announces proposal for merger|url=http://eresources.nlb.gov.sg/history/events/42fcc50a-50aa-4ae3-a18c-823094b60be6#5|publisher=[[National Library, Singapore]]|accessdate=27 June 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|title=Big 'Unity' Plan \u2013 Tengku on Closer Ties with S'pore, Borneo, and Brunei|url=http://eresources.nlb.gov.sg/newspapers/Digitised/Article/straitstimes19610528-1.2.10.aspx|accessdate=27 June 2015|work=[[The Straits Times]]|publisher=[[National Library, Singapore]]|date=28 May 1961}}</ref> It was stated that this would allow the central government to better control and combat communist activities, especially in Singapore.

Most political parties in Sarawak were also against the merger, and in North Borneo, where there were no political parties, community representatives also stated their opposition. Although the Sultan of Brunei supported the merger, the [[Brunei People\\'s Party|Parti Rakyat Brunei]] opposed it as well.

North Borneo, Sarawak and Singapore were also granted some autonomy unavailable to the states of Malaya. After negotiations in July 1963, it was agreed that Malaysia would come into being on 31 August 1963, consisting of Malaya, North Borneo, Sarawak, and Singapore. The date was to coincide with the independence day of Malaya and the British giving self-rule to Sarawak and North Borneo. However, [[Indonesia]] and the [[Philippines]] strenuously objected to this development, with Indonesia claiming Malaysia represented a form of \"[[neocolonialism]]\" and the Philippines claiming North Borneo as its territory.

In 1963 the total population of Malaysia was about 10 million.\n\n==Challenges of independence==\nAt the time of independence, Malaya had great economic advantages. It was among the world's leading producers of three valuable commodities; rubber, tin, and [[palm oil]], and was also a significant iron ore producer. These export industries gave the Malayan government a healthy surplus to invest in industrial development and infrastructure projects. Like other [[Developing country|developing nations]] in the 1950s and 1960s, Malaya (and later Malaysia) placed great stress on state planning, although UMNO was never a socialist party. The First and Second Malayan Plans (1956\u201360 and 1961\u201365 respectively) stimulated economic growth through state investment in industry and repairing infrastructure such as roads and ports, which had been damaged and neglected during the war and the Emergency. The government was keen to reduce Malaya's dependence on commodity exports, which put the country at the mercy of fluctuating prices. The government was also aware that demand for natural rubber was bound to fall as the production and use of [[synthetic rubber]] expanded. Since a third of the Malay workforce worked in the rubber industry it was important to develop alternative sources of employment. Competition for Malaya's rubber markets meant that the profitability of the rubber industry increasingly depended on keeping wages low, which perpetuated rural Malay poverty.\n\n===Foreign objection===\nBoth Indonesia and the Philippines withdrew their ambassadors from Malaya on 15 September 1963, the day before Malaysia's formation. In Jakarta the British and Malayan embassies were stoned, and the British consulate in [[Medan]] was ransacked with Malaya's consul taking refuge in the US consulate. Malaysia withdrew its ambassadors in response, and asked Thailand to represent Malaysia in both countries.<ref name=\"Mathews\">{{cite book|last=Mathews |first=Philip |title=Chronicle of Malaysia: Fifty Years of Headline News, 1963\u20132013 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=md9UAgAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=isbn:9789671061749 |year=2\u201313 |publisher=Editions Didier Millet |isbn=978-967-10617-4-9 |pages=40\u201341}}</ref>\n\nIndonesian President [[Soekarno]], backed by the powerful [[Communist Party of Indonesia]] (PKI), chose to regard Malaysia as a \"neocolonialist\" plot against his country, and backed a Communist insurgency in Sarawak, mainly involving elements of the local Chinese community.

This stabilised the demographic situation and ended the prospect of the Malays becoming a minority in their own country. At the time of independence in 1957, Malays comprised 55% of the population, Chinese 35% and Indians 10%.{{Citation needed|date=November 2010}} This balance was altered by the inclusion of the majority-Chinese Singapore, upsetting many Malays.<ref name=\"Marshall\"/> The federation increased the Chinese proportion to close to 40%. Both UMNO and the MCA were nervous about the possible appeal of Lee's [[People's Action Party]] (then seen as a radical socialist party) to voters in Malaya, and tried to organise a party in Singapore to challenge Lee's position there. Lee in turn threatened to run PAP candidates in Malaya at the 1964 federal elections, despite an earlier agreement that he would not do so (see [[PAP-UMNO Relations]]). Racial tensions intensified as PAP created an opposition alliance aiming for equality between races.<ref name=\"History\"/> This provoked Tunku Abdul Rahman to demand that Singapore withdraw from Malaysia.

The Malays felt unhappy with the wealth of the Chinese community, even after the expulsion of Singapore. Malay political movements emerged based around this.<ref name=\"Marshall\"/> However, since there was no effective opposition party, these issues were contested mainly within the [[coalition government]], which won all but one seat in the first post-independence Malayan Parliament. The two issues were related, since the Chinese advantage in education played a large part in maintaining their control of the economy, which the UMNO leaders were determined to end. The MCA leaders were torn between the need to defend their own community's interests and the need to maintain good relations with UMNO. This produced a crisis in the MCA in 1959, in which a more assertive leadership under [[Lim Chong Eu]] defied UMNO over the education issue, only to be forced to back down when Tunku Abdul Rahman threatened to break up the coalition.\n\nThe Education Act of 1961 put UMNO's victory on the education issue into legislative form. Henceforward Malay and English would be the only teaching languages in secondary schools, and state primary schools would teach in Malay only. Although the Chinese and Indian communities could maintain their own Chinese and [[Tamil language|Tamil]]-language primary schools, all their students were required to learn Malay, and to study an agreed \"Malayan curriculum\". Most importantly, the entry exam to the [[University of Malaya]] (which moved from Singapore to Kuala Lumpur in 1963) would be conducted in Malay, even though most teaching at the university was in English until the 1970s. This had the effect of excluding many Chinese students. At the same time Malay schools were heavily subsidised, and Malays were given preferential treatment. This obvious defeat for the MCA greatly weakened its support in the Chinese community.\n\nAs in education, the UMNO government's unspoken agenda in the field of economic development aimed to shift economic power away from the Chinese and towards the Malays. The two Malayan Plans and the First Malaysian Plan (1966\u20131970) directed resources heavily into developments which would benefit the rural Malay community, such as village schools, rural roads, clinics, and irrigation projects. Several agencies were set up to enable Malay smallholders to upgrade their production and to increase their incomes. The [[Federal Land Development Authority]] (FELDA) helped many Malays to buy farms or to upgrade ones they already owned. The state also provided a range of incentives and low-interest loans to help Malays start [[business]]es, and government tendering systematically favoured Malay companies, leading many Chinese-owned businesses to \"Malayanise\" their management. All this certainly tended to reduce to gap between Chinese and Malay standards of living, although some{{which|date=March 2016}} argued that this would have happened anyway as Malaysia's trade and general prosperity increased.\n\n(Crisis of 1969 and Communist insurgency)\n{{Main|13 May incident|Communist insurgency in Malaysia (1968\u201389)}}\nThe collaboration of the MCA and the MIC in these policies weakened their hold on the Chinese and Indian electorates. At the same time, the effects of the government's [[affirmative action]] policies of the 1950s and 1960s had been to create a discontented class of educated but underemployed Malays. This was a dangerous combination, and led to the formation of a new party, the [[Parti Gerakan Rakyat Malaysia|Malaysian People's Movement]] (Gerakan Rakyat Malaysia) in 1968. Gerakan was a deliberately non-communal party, bringing in Malay trade unionists and intellectuals as well as Chinese and Indian leaders.{{Citation needed|date=November 2010}} At the same time, an [[Islamism|Islamist]] party, the [[Islamic Party of Malaysia]] (PAS) and a Democratic socialist party, the [[Democratic Action Party (Malaysia)|Democratic Action Party]] (DAP), gained increasing support, at the expense of UMNO and the MCA respectively.<ref name=\"Marshall\"/>\n\nFollowing the end of the [[Malayan Emergency]] in 1960, the predominantly [[Malaysian Chinese|ethnic Chinese]] [[Malayan National Liberation Army]], armed wing of the [[Malayan Communist Party]], had retreated to the Malaysian-Thailand border where it had regrouped and retrained for future offensives against the Malaysian government. The insurgency officially began when the MCP ambushed security forces in [[Kroh|Kroh\u2013Betong]], in the northern part of [[Peninsular Malaysia]], on 17 June 1968. Instead of declaring a \"[[state of emergency]]\" as the British had done previously, the Malaysian government responded to the insurgency by introducing several policy initiatives including the Security and Development Program (KESBAN), ''Rukun Tetangga'' (Neighbourhood Watch), and the [[RELA Corps]] (People's Volunteer Group).\n\nAt the May 1969 federal elections, the UMNO-MCA-MIC Alliance polled only 48% of the vote, although it retained a majority in the legislature. The MCA lost most of the Chinese-majority seats to Gerakan or DAP candidates. The victorious opposition celebrated by holding a motorcade on the main streets of Kuala Lumpur with supporters holding up brooms as a signal of its intention to make sweeping changes.  Fear of what the changes might mean for them (as much of the country's businesses were Chinese-owned), a Malay backlash resulted, leading rapidly to [[13 May incident|riots and inter-communal violence]] in which about 6,000 Chinese homes and businesses were burned and at least 184 people were killed, although Western diplomatic sources at the time suggested a toll of close to 600, with most of the victims are Chinese.<ref name=\"TIME Art\">{{cite magazine|url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,828327,00.html |title=Malaysia: The Art of Dispelling Anxiety |magazine=Time magazine |date=27 August 1965 |accessdate=26 October 2010}}</ref><ref name=\"Race war\">{{cite magazine|url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,900859,00.html |title=Race War in Malaysia |magazine=Time magazine |date=23 May 1969 |accessdate=26 October 2010}}</ref> The government declared a state of emergency, and a National Operations Council, headed by Deputy Prime Minister [[Tun Abdul Razak]], took power from the government of Tunku Abdul Rahman, who, in September 1970, was forced to retire in favour of Abdul Razak. It consisted of nine members, mostly Malay, and wielded full political and military power.<ref name=\"Marshall\"/>\n\nUsing the Emergency-era [[Internal Security Act (Malaysia)|Internal Security Act]] (ISA), the new government suspended Parliament and political parties, imposed [[Censorship|press censorship]] and placed severe restrictions on political activity. The ISA gave the government power to intern any person indefinitely without trial. These powers were widely used to silence the government's critics, and have never been repealed. The Constitution was changed to make illegal any criticism, even in Parliament, of the Malaysian monarchy, the special position of Malays in the country, or the status of Malay as the national language.\n\nIn 1971 Parliament reconvened, and a new government coalition, the [[National Front (Malaysia)|National Front]] (Barisan Nasional), was formed in 1973 to replace the Alliance party.<ref name=\"Marshall\"/> The coalition consisted of UMNO, the MCA, the MIC, Gerakan, [[People's Progressive Party (Malaysia)|PPP]], and regional parties in Sabah and Sarawak. The PAS also joined the Front but was expelled in 1977. The DAP was left outside as the only significant opposition party. Abdul Razak held office until his death in 1976. He was succeeded by Datuk [[Hussein Onn]], the son of UMNO's founder Onn Jaafar, and then by Tun [[Mahathir Mohamad]], who had been Education Minister since 1981, and who held power for 22 years. During these years policies were put in place which led to the rapid transformation of Malaysia's economy and society, such as the controversial [[Malaysian New Economic Policy|New Economic Policy]], which was intended to increase proportionally the share of the economic \"pie\" of the [[bumiputra]]s as compared to other ethnic groups\u2014was launched by Prime Minister [[Tun Abdul Razak]].

The government's response was the [[New Economic Policy (Malaysia)|New Economic Policy]] of 1971, which was to be implemented through a series of four five-year plans from 1971 to 1990.{{Citation needed|date=November 2010}} The plan had two objectives: the elimination of poverty, particularly rural poverty, and the elimination of the identification between race and prosperity.<ref name=\"Marshall\"/> This latter policy was understood to mean a decisive shift in economic power from the Chinese to the Malays,{{Citation needed|date=November 2010}} who until then made up only 5% of the professional class.<ref name=\"Marshall\"/>\n\nPoverty was tackled through an [[agricultural policy]] which resettled 250,000 Malays on newly cleared farmland, more investment in [[rural infrastructure]], and the creation of [[free trade zone]]s in rural areas to create new manufacturing jobs. Little was done to improve the living standards of the low-paid workers in plantation agriculture, although this group steadily declined as a proportion of the workforce. By 1990 the poorest parts of Malaysia were rural Sabah and Sarawak, which lagged significantly behind the rest of the country. During the 1970s and \u201880s rural poverty did decline, particularly in the Malayan Peninsula, but critics of the government's policy contend that this was mainly due to the growth of overall national prosperity (due in large part to the discovery of important oil and gas reserves) and migration of rural people to the cities rather than to state intervention. These years saw rapid growth in Malaysian cities, particularly Kuala Lumpur, which became a magnet for immigration both from rural Malaya and from poorer neighbours such as Indonesia, [[Bangladesh]], Thailand and the Philippines. Urban poverty became a problem for the first time, with [[shanty town]]s growing up around the cities.{{Citation needed|date=November 2010}}\n\nThe second arm of government policy, driven mainly by Mahathir first as Education Minister and then as Prime Minister, was the transfer of economic power to the Malays. Mahathir greatly expanded the number of secondary schools and universities throughout the country, and enforced the policy of teaching in Malay rather than English. This had the effect of creating a large new Malay professional class. It also created an unofficial barrier against Chinese access to higher education, since few Chinese are sufficiently fluent in [[Malay language|Malay]] to study at Malay-language universities. Chinese families therefore sent their children to universities in Singapore, Australia, Britain or the United States \u2013 by 2000, for example, 60,000 Malaysians held degrees from Australian universities. This had the [[unintended consequence]] of exposing large numbers of Malaysians to life in [[Western world|Western countries]], creating a new source of discontent. Mahathir also greatly expanded educational opportunities for Malay women \u2013 by 2000 half of all university students were women.\n\n[[File:KLCC twin towers2.JPG|thumb|left|[[Petronas Twin Towers]], Kuala Lumpur, the tallest building in Southeast Asia.]]\nTo find jobs for all these new Malay graduates, the government created several agencies for intervention in the economy. The most important of these were PERNAS (National Corporation Ltd.), [[PETRONAS]] (National Petroleum Ltd.), and HICOM (Heavy Industry Corporation of Malaysia), which not only directly employed many Malays but also invested in growing areas of the economy to create new technical and administrative jobs which were preferentially allocated to Malays. As a result, the share of Malay equity in the economy rose from 1.5% in 1969 to 20.3% in 1990, and the percentage of businesses of all kinds owned by Malays rose from 39 percent to 68 percent. This latter figure was deceptive because many businesses that appeared to be Malay-owned were still indirectly controlled by Chinese, but there is no doubt that the Malay share of the economy considerably increased. The Chinese remained disproportionately powerful in Malaysian economic life, but by 2000 the distinction between Chinese and Malay business was fading as many new corporations, particularly in growth sectors such as information technology, were owned and managed by people from both ethnic groups.\n\nMalaysia's rapid [[economic progress]] since 1970, which was only temporarily disrupted by the [[Asian financial crisis]] of 1997, has not been matched by change in [[Politics of Malaysia|Malaysian politics]]. The repressive measures passed in 1970 remain in place. Malaysia has had regular elections since 1974, and although campaigning is reasonably free at election time, it is in effect a [[one-party state]], with the UMNO-controlled National Front usually winning nearly all the seats, while the DAP wins some Chinese urban seats and the PAS some rural Malay ones. Since the DAP and the PAS have diametrically opposed policies, they have been unable to form an effective opposition coalition. There is almost no criticism of the government in the media and public protest remains severely restricted. The ISA continues to be used to silence dissidents, and the members of the UMNO [[youth movement]] are deployed to physically intimidate opponents.\n\n===Mahathir administration===\n[[File:Mahathir Mohamad addressing the United Nations General Assembly (September 25 2003).jpg|right|200px|thumb|alt=A photo showing former Prime Minister Mahatir bin Mohamad standing with head down and surrounded by government officials at the celebration of the 50th independence day.|[[Mahathir Mohamad]] was the leading force in making Malaysia into a major industrial power.]]\nThe restoration of democracy after the 1969 crisis caused disputes in the UMNO, a struggle of power which increased after the death of [[Tun Abdul Razak]]. The ailing Datuk Hussein Bin Onn replaced him, but the fight for control shifted to appointing the deputy prime minister. Mahathir Mohamad was chosen, an advocate of [[Bumiputra]] who also tried to benefit the other ethnic communities.<ref name=\"Marshall\"/>\n\nUnder the premiership of [[Mahathir Mohamad]], Malaysia experienced economic growth from the 1980s, a 1985\u201386 property market depression,<ref>{{Cite journal|title=Property: A Steep Climb with a Gentle Descent|journal=Euromoney|publisher=Euromoney Institutional Investor|date=August 1992}}</ref> and returned to growth through to the mid-1990s.<ref>{{cite news|author=Anthony Spaeth |url=http://www.time.com/time/asia/2003/mahathir/mahathir961209.html |title=Bound for Glory |publisher=Time New York |date=9 December 1996 |accessdate=26 October 2010 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090317235536/http://www.time.com/time/asia/2003/mahathir/mahathir961209.html |archivedate=17 March 2009 }}</ref> Mahathir increased privatisation and introduced the New Development Policy (NDP), designed to increase economic wealth for all Malaysians, rather than just Malays.<ref name=\"Marshall\"/> The period saw a shift from an agriculture-based economy to one based on manufacturing and industry in areas such as computers and consumer electronics. It was during this period, too, that the physical landscape of Malaysia changed with the emergence of numerous mega-projects. Notable amongst these projects were the construction of the [[Petronas Twin Towers]] (at the time the tallest building in the world, and, as of 2016, still the tallest twin building), [[Kuala Lumpur International Airport]] (KLIA), the [[North\u2013South Expressway (Malaysia)|North\u2013South Expressway]], the [[Sepang International Circuit]], the [[MSC Malaysia|Multimedia Super Corridor]] (MSC), the Bakun hydroelectric dam, and [[Putrajaya]], the new federal administrative capital.\n\nUnder [[Mahathir Mohamad]]\u2019s long Prime Ministership (1981\u20132003), Malaysia's [[political culture]] became increasingly centralised and authoritarian, due to Mahathir's belief that the multiethnic Malaysia could only remain stable through controlled democracy. In 1986\u201387, he faced leadership challenges among his own party. There were also attacks by the government on several [[non-governmental organisation]]s (NGO) which were critical of various government policies.<ref>{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=JSBZ7GffengC&pg=PA36&lpg=PA36#v=onepage&q&f=false |title=Social Movement Malaysia|editor1=Saliha Hassan |editor2=Meredith Weiss |publisher=Routledge |year= 2002 |page=36 |isbn=978-0700716463 }}</ref> There were also issues such the questioning by MCA's [[Lee Kim Sai]] over the use of the term ''[[pendatang]]'' (immigrants) that was seen as challenging Malay's [[bumiputra]] status,<ref>{{cite book |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=v9QEBAAAQBAJ&pg=PA515&lpg=PA515#v=onepage&q&f=false |title=Southeast Asian Personalities of Chinese Descent: A Biographical Dictionary |editor= Leo Suryadinata |author=Lee Kam Hing |page=516 |publisher=Institute of Southeast Asian Studies |year= 2012 |isbn=978-9814345217 }}</ref>  as well as rumours of forced conversion to or from Islam.<ref name=protest>{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=u87MgDuMjbkC&pg=PA124#v=onepage&q&f=false |title=Protest and Possibilities: Civil Society and Coalitions for Political Change in Malaysia |author = Meredith Leigh Weiss |page=124 |publisher=Stanford University Press|year= 2005 |isbn=978-0804752954 }}</ref> Mahathir initiated a crackdown on opposition dissidents with the use of the Internal Security Act named [[Operation Lalang]]. The Internal Security Act was invoked in October 1987 arresting 106 people, including opposition leaders. The head of the judiciary and five members of the supreme court who had questioned his use of the ISA were also arrested, and a clampdown on Malaysia's press occurred.<ref name=\"Marshall\"/>\n\nThis culminated in the dismissal and imprisonment on unsubstantiated charges of the Deputy Prime Minister, [[Anwar Ibrahim]], in 1997 after an internal dispute within the government. The complicity of the judiciary in this piece of persecution was seen as a particularly clear sign of the decline of Malaysian democracy. The Anwar affair led to the formation of a new party, the [[People's Justice Party (Malaysia)|People's Justice Party]], or Keadilan, led by Anwar's wife, [[Wan Azizah Wan Ismail]]. At the 1999 elections Keadilan formed a coalition with the DAP and the PAS known as the Alternative Front ([[Barisan Alternatif]]). The result of this was that the PAS won a number of Malay seats from UMNO, but many Chinese voters disapproved of this unnatural alliance with the Islamist PAS, causing the DAP to lose many of its seats to the MCA, including that of its veteran leader, [[Lim Kit Siang]]. Wan Azizah won her husband's former constituency in Penang but otherwise Keadilan made little impact.\n\nIn the late 1990s, Malaysia was shaken by the [[1997 Asian Financial Crisis|Asian financial crisis]], which damaged Malaysia's assembly line-based economy. Mahathir combated it initially with IMF approved policies. However, the devaluation of the [[Malaysian Ringgit|Ringgit]] and the deepening recession caused him to create his own programme, based on protecting Malaysia from foreign investors and reinvigorating the economy through construction projects and the lowering of interest rates. The policies caused Malaysia's economy to rebound by 2002, but brought disagreement between Mahathir and his deputy, [[Anwar Ibrahim]], who backed the IMF policies.<ref name=\"Marshall\"/> This led to the sacking of the Anwar, causing political unrest.<ref>{{cite news|author=Anthony Spaeth |url=http://www.time.com/time/asia/asia/magazine/1998/980914/cover1.html |title=He's the Boss |publisher=Time Asia Hong Kong |date=14 September 1998 |accessdate=26 October 2010}}</ref> Anwar was arrested and banned from politics on what are considered trumped up charges.<ref name=\"Marshall\"/> In 2003 Mahathir, Malaysia's longest serving prime minister, voluntarily retired in favour of his new deputy, [[Abdullah Ahmad Badawi]].<ref name=\"Marshall\"/> In November 2007 two anti-government rallies occurred, precipitated by allegations of corruption and discrepancies in the election system that heavily favoured the ruling political coalition, [[National Front (Malaysia)|National Front]] ([[Barisan Nasional]]), which has been in power since Malaya achieved independence.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://asiasentinel.com/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=863&Itemid=31 |title=Malaysian Petitioners Defy Police |publisher=Asia Sentinel |accessdate=9 July 2009 |last=Imtiaz Shah Yacob |first=Imran}}</ref>\n\n===Abdullah administration===\nDato Seri [[Abdullah Ahmad Badawi]] freed Anwar,<ref name=\"Marshall\"/> which was seen as a portent of a mild liberalisation.{{Citation needed|date=November 2010}} At the [[2004 Malaysian general election|2004 election]], the National Front led by Abdullah had a massive victory,<ref name=\"Marshall\"/> virtually wiping out the PAS and Keadilan, although the DAP recovered the seats it had lost in 1999. This victory was seen as the result mainly of Abdullah's personal popularity and the strong recovery of Malaysia's economy, which has lifted the living standards of many Malaysians to almost [[first world]] standards, coupled with an ineffective opposition. The government's objective is for Malaysia to become a fully [[developed country]] by 2020 as expressed in ''[[Wawasan 2020]]''. It leaves unanswered, however, the question of when and how Malaysia will acquire a first world [[political system]] (a multi-party democracy, a free press, an [[Judicial independence|independent judiciary]] and the restoration of civil and political liberties) to go with its new economic maturity.\n\nIn November 2007, Malaysia was rocked by two anti-government rallies. The 2007 [[Bersih 2.0 rally|Bersih Rally]] which was attended by 40,000 people was held in Kuala Lumpur on 10 November 2007, to campaign for [[electoral reform]].

The adoption of Islam in the 14th century saw the rise of a number of sultanates, the most prominent of which was the [[Sultanate of Malacca]]. Islam had a profound influence on the [[Malay people]], but has also been influenced by them. The [[Portugal|Portuguese]] were the first European colonial powers to establish themselves on the Malay Peninsula and [[Southeast Asia]], capturing Malacca in 1511, followed by the Dutch in 1641. However, it was the British who, after initially establishing bases at [[Jesselton]], [[Kuching]], [[Penang]] and [[Singapore]], ultimately secured their hegemony across the territory that is now Malaysia. The [[Anglo-Dutch Treaty of 1824]] defined the boundaries between [[British Malaya]] and the [[Netherlands East Indies]] (which became Indonesia). A fourth phase of foreign influence was immigration of Chinese and Indian workers to meet the needs of the colonial economy created by the British in the Malay Peninsula and Borneo.<ref>Annual Report on the Federation of Malaya: 1951 in C.C.

The first four states to accept British residents, Perak, Selangor, [[Negeri Sembilan]], and Pahang, were termed the [[Federated Malay States]]: while technically independent, they were placed under a Resident-General in 1895, making them British colonies in all but name. The Unfederated Malay States (Johore, Kedah, Kelantan, Perlis, and Terengganu) had a slightly larger degree of independence, although they were unable to resist the wishes of their [[Resident (title)|British residents]] for long.

Malaya's obvious attractions were its [[tin]] and [[gold]] mines, but British planters soon began to experiment with tropical plantation crops\u2014[[tapioca]], [[uncaria|gambier]], pepper, and coffee. But in 1877 the rubber plant was introduced from [[Brazil]], and [[rubber]] soon became Malaya's staple export, stimulated by booming demand from European industry. Rubber was later joined by [[palm oil]] as an export earner. All these industries required a large and disciplined [[Labor force|labour force]], and the British did not regard the Malays as reliable workers. The solution was the importation of plantation workers from India, mainly [[Tamil language|Tamil]]-speakers from [[South India]]. A small group of Malabaris were brought from the current place called Kerala to help with the rubber plantations, resulting in the small Malabari population seen in Malaysia today. The mines, mills and docks also attracted a flood of immigrant workers from southern China. Soon towns like Singapore, Penang, and [[Ipoh]] were majority Chinese, as was [[Kuala Lumpur]], founded as a tin-mining centre in 1857. By 1891, when Malaya's first census was taken, Perak and Selangor, the main tin-mining states, had Chinese majorities.<ref>Hays, Jeffrey. \u201cBRITISH IN MALAYSIA.\u201d Facts and Details, https://factsanddetails.com/southeast-asia/Malaysia/sub5_4a/entry-3619.html#chapter-5.</ref>\n\nThe Chinese mostly arrived poor; yet their belief in industriousness and frugality, their emphasis in their children's education and their maintenance of Confucian family hierarchy, as well as their voluntary connection with tightly knit networks of [[Benefit society|mutual aid societies]] (run by \"Hui-Guan\" \u6703\u9928, or non-profit organisations with nominal geographic affiliations from different parts of China) all contributed to their prosperity. In the 1890s [[Yap Ah Loy]], who held the title of Kapitan China of Kuala Lumpur, was the richest man in Malaya, owning a chain of mines, plantations and shops. Malaya's banking and insurance industries were run by the Chinese from the start, and Chinese businesses, usually in partnership with London firms, soon had a stranglehold on the economy. Since the Malay Sultans tended to spend well beyond their means, they were soon indebted to Chinese bankers, and this gave the Chinese political as well as economic leverage. At first the Chinese immigrants were mostly men, and many intended to return home when they had made their fortunes. Many did go home, but many more stayed. At first they married Malay women, producing a community of Sino-Malayans or [[Peranakan|baba]] people, but soon they began importing Chinese brides, establishing permanent communities and building schools and temples.\n\nThe Indians were initially less successful, since unlike the Chinese they came mainly as indentured labourers to work in the rubber plantations, and had few of the economic opportunities that the Chinese had. They were also a less united community, since they were divided between Hindus and Muslims and along lines of language and [[caste]]. An Indian commercial and [[professional class]] emerged during the early 20th century, but the majority of Indians remained poor and uneducated in [[rural ghetto]]s in the rubber-growing areas.\n\nTraditional Malay society had great difficulty coping with both the loss of political sovereignty to the British and of economic power to the Chinese. By the early 20th century it seemed possible that the Malays would become a minority in their own country. The Sultans, who were seen as collaborators with both the British and the Chinese, lost some of their traditional prestige, particularly among the increasing number of Malays with a western education, but the mass of rural Malays continued to revere the Sultans and their prestige was thus an important prop for [[Colonialism|colonial rule]]. A small class of Malay nationalist intellectuals began to emerge during the early 20th century, and there was also a revival of Islam in response to the perceived threat of other imported religions, particularly Christianity. In fact few Malays [[Christianization|converted to Christianity]], although many Chinese did. The northern regions, which were less influenced by western ideas, became strongholds of Islamic conservatism, as they have remained.\n\nThe one consolation to Malay pride was that the British allowed them a virtual monopoly of positions in the police and local [[military unit]]s, as well as a majority of those administrative positions open to non-Europeans. While the Chinese mostly built and paid for their own schools and colleges, importing teachers from China, the colonial government fostered education for Malays, opening [[Malay College Kuala Kangsar|Malay College]] in 1905 and creating the Malay Administrative Service in 1910. (The college was dubbed \u201cBab ud-Darajat\u201d \u2013 the Gateway to High Rank.) [[Universiti Pendidikan Sultan Idris|A Malay Teachers College]] followed in 1922, and a Malay Women's Training College in 1935. All this reflected the official British policy that Malaya belonged to the Malays, and that the other races were but temporary residents. This view was increasingly out of line with reality, and contained the seeds of much future trouble.\n\nThe Malay teacher's college had lectures and writings that nurtured [[Early Malay nationalism|Malay nationalism]] and anti-colonialist sentiments. Due to this it is known as the birthplace of [[early Malay nationalism|Malay nationalism]].<ref name=\"KBSM F2\">{{cite book|pages=208\u2013209|title=Kurikulum Bersepadu Sekolah Menengah Sejarah Tingkatan 2.|author=Zainal Abidin bin Abdul Wahid |author2=[[Khoo Kay Kim|Khoo, Kay Kim]] |author3=Muhd Yusof bin Ibrahim |author4=Singh, D.S.

It was the first nationalist political organisation in British Malaya, advocating for the union of all Malays regardless of origin, and fighting for Malay rights and against British Imperialism. A specific ideal the KMM held was ''Panji Melayu Raya'', which called for the unification of British Malaya and [[Dutch East Indies]].<ref name=\"KBSM F2\"/>\n\nIn the years before [[World War II]], the British were concerned with finding the balance between a centralised state and maintaining the power of the Sultans in Malaya.<ref name=\"History\"/> There were no moves to give Malaya a unitary government, and in fact in 1935 the position of Resident-General of the Federated States was abolished, and its powers decentralised to the individual states. With their usual tendency to racial stereotyping, the British regarded the Malays as amiable but unsophisticated and rather lazy, incapable of self-government, although making good soldiers under British officers. They regarded the Chinese as clever but dangerous\u2014and indeed during the 1920s and 1930s, reflecting events in China, the Chinese Nationalist Party (the [[Kuomintang]]) and the [[Communist Party of China]] built rival clandestine organisations in Malaya, leading to regular disturbances in the Chinese towns. The British saw no way that Malaya's disparate collection of states and races could become a nation, let alone an independent one.\n\n==War and emergency==\n[[File:Tugu Negara.jpg|thumb|right|''[[Tugu Negara]]'', the Malaysian national monument is dedicated to those who fell during World War II and the Malayan Emergency.]]\nAlthough a belligerent as part of the British Empire, Malaya saw little action during [[World War I]], except for the sinking of the [[Russian cruiser Zhemchug]] by the German cruiser [[SMS Emden]] on 28 October 1914 during the [[Battle of Penang]].\n\n[[Image:Lot-2651-2 (34230021050).jpg|thumb|right|Japanese troops landed on Malaya in 1941]]\nThe [[World War II|outbreak of war]] in [[Pacific theatre of World War II|the Pacific]] in December 1941 found the British in Malaya completely unprepared. During the 1930s, anticipating the rising threat of Japanese naval power, they had built a great naval base at Singapore, but never anticipated an invasion of Malaya from the north. Because of the demands of the war in Europe, there was virtually no British air capacity in the Far East. The Japanese were thus able to attack from their bases in [[French Indo-China]] with impunity, and despite stubborn resistance from British, Australian, and Indian forces, they [[Japanese invasion of Malaya|overran Malaya]] in two months. Singapore, with no landward defences, no air cover, and no [[water supply]], was forced to surrender in February 1942, doing irreparable damage to British prestige. British North Borneo and Brunei were also occupied.\n\nThe Japanese had a racial policy just as the British did. They regarded the Malays as a colonial people liberated from British imperialist rule, and fostered a limited form of Malay nationalism, which gained them some degree of collaboration from the Malay civil service and intellectuals. (Most of the Sultans also collaborated with the Japanese, although they maintained later that they had done so unwillingly.){{Citation needed|date=September 2012}} The Malay nationalist Kesatuan Melayu Muda, advocates of ''[[Melayu Raya]]'', collaborated with the Japanese, based on the understanding that Japan would unite the Dutch East Indies, Malaya and Borneo and grant them independence.<ref name=\"Graham\">{{cite journal|first=Brown |last=Graham |title=The Formation and Management of Political Identities: Indonesia and Malaysia Compared |publisher=Centre for Research on Inequality, Human Security and Ethnicity, CRISE, University of Oxford |date=February 2005 |url=http://www.crise.ox.ac.uk/pubs/workingpaper10.pdf |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120210163849/http://www.crise.ox.ac.uk/pubs/workingpaper10.pdf |archivedate=10 February 2012 }}</ref> The occupiers regarded the Chinese, however, as [[enemy alien]]s, and treated them with great harshness: during the so-called ''[[Sook Ching massacre|sook ching]]'' (purification through suffering), up to 80,000 Chinese in Malaya and Singapore were killed. Chinese businesses were expropriated and Chinese schools either closed or burned down. Not surprisingly the Chinese, led by the [[Malayan Communist Party]] (MCP), became the backbone of the [[Malayan Peoples' Anti-Japanese Army]] (MPAJA), a force similar to the Soviet-supported [[Partisan (military)|Partisan]] rebel forces led by local Communist parties in the Eastern European theatre. With British assistance, the MPAJA became the most effective resistance force in the occupied Asian countries.\n\nAlthough the Japanese argued that they supported Malay nationalism, they offended Malay nationalism by allowing their ally [[Thailand]] to re-annex the four northern states, Kedah, Perlis, Kelantan, and Terengganu that had been surrendered to the British in 1909.

Colonial self-rule and eventual independence were now British policy. The tide of colonial nationalism sweeping through Asia soon reached Malaya. But most Malays were more concerned with defending themselves against the MCP which was mostly made up of Chinese, than with demanding independence from the British; indeed, their immediate concern was that the British not leave and abandon the Malays to the armed Communists of the MPAJA, which was the largest armed force in the country.\n\n[[File:Japanese troops mopping up in Kuala Lumpur.jpg|thumb|left|Japanese troops moving through Kuala Lumpur during their advance through Malaya.]]<!-- Found here: http://www.iwmcollections.org.uk/dbtw-wpd/exec/dbtwpub.dll?AC=GET_RECORD&XC=/dbtw-wpd/exec/dbtwpub.dll&BU=http://www.iwmcollections.org.uk/qryPhotoImg.php&TN=Uncat&SN=AUTO9448&SE=565&RN=0&MR=25&TR=0&TX=1000&ES=0&CS=1&XP=&RF=phoResults&EF=&DF=phoDetails&RL=0&EL=0&DL=0&NP=1&ID=&MF=WPENGMSG.INI&MQ=&TI=0&DT=&ST=0&IR=162462&NR=0&NB=0&SV=0&BG=0&FG=0&QS= -->\n\nIn 1944, the British drew up plans for a [[Malayan Union]], which would turn the Federated and Unfederated Malay States, plus Penang and Malacca (but not Singapore), into a single Crown colony, with a view towards independence.

Faced with implacable Malay opposition, the British dropped the plan for equal citizenship. The Malayan Union was thus established in 1946, and was dissolved in 1948 and replaced by the [[Federation of Malaya]], which restored the autonomy of the rulers of the Malay states under British protection.\n\nMeanwhile, the Communists were moving towards open insurrection. The MPAJA had been disbanded in December 1945, and the MCP organised as a legal political party, but the MPAJA's arms were carefully stored for future use. The MCP policy was for immediate independence with full equality for all races. This meant it recruited very few Malays. The Party's strength was in the Chinese-dominated trade unions, particularly in Singapore, and in the Chinese schools, where the teachers, mostly born in China, saw the [[Communist Party of China]] as the leader of China's [[Romantic nationalism|national revival]]. In March 1947, reflecting the international Communist movement's \u201cturn to left\u201d as the [[Cold War]] set in, the MCP leader [[Lai Tek]] was purged and replaced by the veteran MPAJA guerrilla leader [[Chin Peng]], who turned the party increasingly to [[direct action]]. These rebels, under the leadership of the MCP, launched guerrilla operations designed to force the British out of Malaya. In July, following a string of assassinations of plantation managers, the colonial government struck back, declaring a [[State of emergency|State of Emergency]], banning the MCP and arresting hundreds of its militants. The Party retreated to the jungle and formed the [[Malayan Peoples\u2019 Liberation Army]], with about 13,000 men under arms, all Chinese.\n\nThe [[Malayan Emergency]] as it was known, lasted from 1948 to 1960 and involved a long anti-insurgency campaign by [[Commonwealth of Nations|Commonwealth]] troops in Malaya. The British strategy, which proved ultimately successful, was to isolate the MCP from its support base by a combination of economic and [[concession (politics)|political concessions]] to the Chinese and the resettlement of Chinese squatters into \u201cNew Villages\u201d in \u201cwhite areas\u201d free of MCP influence. In December 1948, 24 villagers were executed by British troops.<ref>https://www.theguardian.com/world/2011/apr/09/malaya-massacre-villagers-coverup</ref> From 1949 the MCP campaign lost momentum and the number of recruits fell sharply. Although the MCP succeeded in assassinating the British [[High Commissioner]], Sir [[Henry Gurney]], in October 1951, this turn to terrorist tactics alienated many moderate Chinese from the Party. The arrival of Lt.-Gen Sir [[Gerald Templer]] as British commander in 1952 was the beginning of the end of the Emergency. Templer invented the techniques of [[counter-insurgency]] warfare in Malaya and applied them ruthlessly. Although the insurgency was defeated Commonwealth troops remained with the backdrop of the [[Cold War]].<ref>[http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,826360,00.html \"Malaya: Siege's End\"], ''Time'', New York, 2 May 1960.</ref> Against this backdrop, [[Hari Merdeka|independence]] for the Federation within the Commonwealth was granted on 31 August 1957,<ref name=\"TIME New Nation\">[http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,893616,00.html \"A New Nation\"], ''Time'', New York, 9 September 1957</ref> with [[Tunku Abdul Rahman]] as the first prime minister.<ref name=\"state.gov\"/>\n\n==Towards Malaysia==\n[[File:Dataran Merdeka.jpg|thumb|[[Dataran Merdeka]] (Independence Square) in Kuala Lumpur, where Malaysians celebrate Independence Day on 31 August each year.]]\nChinese reaction against the MCP was shown by the formation of the [[Malaysian Chinese Association|Malayan Chinese Association]] (MCA) in 1949 as a vehicle for moderate Chinese political opinion. Its leader [[Tan Cheng Lock]] favoured a policy of collaboration with UMNO to win Malayan independence on a policy of equal citizenship, but with sufficient concessions to Malay sensitivities to ease nationalist fears. Tan formed a close collaboration with Tunku (Prince) [[Tunku Abdul Rahman|Abdul Rahman]], the Chief Minister of [[Kedah]] and from 1951 successor to Datuk Onn as leader of UMNO. Since the British had announced in 1949 that Malaya would soon become independent whether the Malayans liked it or not, both leaders were determined to forge an agreement their communities could live with as a basis for a stable independent state. The UMNO-MCA Alliance, which was later joined by the [[Malaysian Indian Congress|Malayan Indian Congress]] (MIC), won convincing victories in local and state elections in both Malay and Chinese areas between 1952 and 1955.<ref name=\"Federation of Malaya Agreement\">''See'': {{Wikisource-inline|Federation of Malaya Agreement}}</ref>\n\nThe introduction of elected local government was another important step in defeating the Communists. After [[Joseph Stalin]]\u2019s death in 1953, there was a split in the MCP leadership over the wisdom of continuing the armed struggle. Many MCP militants lost heart and went home, and by the time Templer left Malaya in 1954, the Emergency was over, although [[Chin Peng]] led a diehard group that lurked in the inaccessible country along the Thai border for many years.\n\nDuring 1955 and 1956 UMNO, the MCA and the British hammered out a constitutional settlement for a principle of equal citizenship for all races. In exchange, the MCA agreed that [[Yang di-Pertuan Agong|Malaya's head of state]] would be drawn from the ranks of the Malay Sultans, that [[Malay language|Malay]] would be the official language, and that Malay education and [[economic development]] would be promoted and subsidised. In effect, this meant that Malaya would be run by the Malays, particularly since they continued to dominate the civil service, the army and the police, but that the Chinese and Indians would have proportionate representation in the Cabinet and the parliament, would run those states where they were the majority, and would have their economic position protected. The difficult issue of who would control the [[Education|education system]] was deferred until after independence. This came on 31 August 1957, when [[Tunku Abdul Rahman]] became the first Prime Minister of independent Malaya.\n\nThis left the unfinished business of the other British-ruled territories in the region. After the [[Surrender of Japan|Japanese surrender]] the [[Brooke family]] and the British North Borneo Company gave up their control of Sarawak and North Borneo respectively, and these became British Crown Colonies. They were much less economically developed than Malaya, and their local political leaderships were too weak to demand independence. Singapore, with its large Chinese majority, achieved autonomy in 1955, and in 1959 the young leader [[Lee Kuan Yew]] became Prime Minister. The [[Sultan of Brunei]] remained as a British client in his oil-rich enclave. Between 1959 and 1962 the [[Her Majesty's Government|British government]] orchestrated complex negotiations between these local leaders and the Malayan government.\n\nOn 24 April 1961, Lee Kuan Yew proposed the idea of forming Malaysia during a meeting to Tunku Abdul Rahman, after which Tunku invited Lee to prepare a paper elaborating on this idea.

In 1963 the total population of Malaysia was about 10 million.\n\n==Challenges of independence==\nAt the time of independence, Malaya had great economic advantages. It was among the world's leading producers of three valuable commodities; rubber, tin, and [[palm oil]], and was also a significant iron ore producer. These export industries gave the Malayan government a healthy surplus to invest in industrial development and infrastructure projects. Like other [[Developing country|developing nations]] in the 1950s and 1960s, Malaya (and later Malaysia) placed great stress on state planning, although UMNO was never a socialist party. The First and Second Malayan Plans (1956\u201360 and 1961\u201365 respectively) stimulated economic growth through state investment in industry and repairing infrastructure such as roads and ports, which had been damaged and neglected during the war and the Emergency. The government was keen to reduce Malaya's dependence on commodity exports, which put the country at the mercy of fluctuating prices. The government was also aware that demand for natural rubber was bound to fall as the production and use of [[synthetic rubber]] expanded. Since a third of the Malay workforce worked in the rubber industry it was important to develop alternative sources of employment. Competition for Malaya's rubber markets meant that the profitability of the rubber industry increasingly depended on keeping wages low, which perpetuated rural Malay poverty.\n\n===Foreign objection===\nBoth Indonesia and the Philippines withdrew their ambassadors from Malaya on 15 September 1963, the day before Malaysia's formation. In Jakarta the British and Malayan embassies were stoned, and the British consulate in [[Medan]] was ransacked with Malaya's consul taking refuge in the US consulate. Malaysia withdrew its ambassadors in response, and asked Thailand to represent Malaysia in both countries.<ref name=\"Mathews\">{{cite book|last=Mathews |first=Philip |title=Chronicle of Malaysia: Fifty Years of Headline News, 1963\u20132013 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=md9UAgAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=isbn:9789671061749 |year=2\u201313 |publisher=Editions Didier Millet |isbn=978-967-10617-4-9 |pages=40\u201341}}</ref>\n\nIndonesian President [[Soekarno]], backed by the powerful [[Communist Party of Indonesia]] (PKI), chose to regard Malaysia as a \"neocolonialist\" plot against his country, and backed a Communist insurgency in Sarawak, mainly involving elements of the local Chinese community.

This stabilised the demographic situation and ended the prospect of the Malays becoming a minority in their own country. At the time of independence in 1957, Malays comprised 55% of the population, Chinese 35% and Indians 10%.{{Citation needed|date=November 2010}} This balance was altered by the inclusion of the majority-Chinese Singapore, upsetting many Malays.<ref name=\"Marshall\"/> The federation increased the Chinese proportion to close to 40%. Both UMNO and the MCA were nervous about the possible appeal of Lee's [[People's Action Party]] (then seen as a radical socialist party) to voters in Malaya, and tried to organise a party in Singapore to challenge Lee's position there. Lee in turn threatened to run PAP candidates in Malaya at the 1964 federal elections, despite an earlier agreement that he would not do so (see [[PAP-UMNO Relations]]). Racial tensions intensified as PAP created an opposition alliance aiming for equality between races.<ref name=\"History\"/> This provoked Tunku Abdul Rahman to demand that Singapore withdraw from Malaysia.

The Malays felt unhappy with the wealth of the Chinese community, even after the expulsion of Singapore. Malay political movements emerged based around this.<ref name=\"Marshall\"/> However, since there was no effective opposition party, these issues were contested mainly within the [[coalition government]], which won all but one seat in the first post-independence Malayan Parliament. The two issues were related, since the Chinese advantage in education played a large part in maintaining their control of the economy, which the UMNO leaders were determined to end. The MCA leaders were torn between the need to defend their own community's interests and the need to maintain good relations with UMNO. This produced a crisis in the MCA in 1959, in which a more assertive leadership under [[Lim Chong Eu]] defied UMNO over the education issue, only to be forced to back down when Tunku Abdul Rahman threatened to break up the coalition.\n\nThe Education Act of 1961 put UMNO's victory on the education issue into legislative form. Henceforward Malay and English would be the only teaching languages in secondary schools, and state primary schools would teach in Malay only. Although the Chinese and Indian communities could maintain their own Chinese and [[Tamil language|Tamil]]-language primary schools, all their students were required to learn Malay, and to study an agreed \"Malayan curriculum\". Most importantly, the entry exam to the [[University of Malaya]] (which moved from Singapore to Kuala Lumpur in 1963) would be conducted in Malay, even though most teaching at the university was in English until the 1970s. This had the effect of excluding many Chinese students. At the same time Malay schools were heavily subsidised, and Malays were given preferential treatment. This obvious defeat for the MCA greatly weakened its support in the Chinese community.\n\nAs in education, the UMNO government's unspoken agenda in the field of economic development aimed to shift economic power away from the Chinese and towards the Malays. The two Malayan Plans and the First Malaysian Plan (1966\u20131970) directed resources heavily into developments which would benefit the rural Malay community, such as village schools, rural roads, clinics, and irrigation projects. Several agencies were set up to enable Malay smallholders to upgrade their production and to increase their incomes. The [[Federal Land Development Authority]] (FELDA) helped many Malays to buy farms or to upgrade ones they already owned. The state also provided a range of incentives and low-interest loans to help Malays start [[business]]es, and government tendering systematically favoured Malay companies, leading many Chinese-owned businesses to \"Malayanise\" their management. All this certainly tended to reduce to gap between Chinese and Malay standards of living, although some{{which|date=March 2016}} argued that this would have happened anyway as Malaysia's trade and general prosperity increased.\n\n(Crisis of 1969 and Communist insurgency)\n{{Main|13 May incident|Communist insurgency in Malaysia (1968\u201389)}}\nThe collaboration of the MCA and the MIC in these policies weakened their hold on the Chinese and Indian electorates. At the same time, the effects of the government's [[affirmative action]] policies of the 1950s and 1960s had been to create a discontented class of educated but underemployed Malays. This was a dangerous combination, and led to the formation of a new party, the [[Parti Gerakan Rakyat Malaysia|Malaysian People's Movement]] (Gerakan Rakyat Malaysia) in 1968. Gerakan was a deliberately non-communal party, bringing in Malay trade unionists and intellectuals as well as Chinese and Indian leaders.{{Citation needed|date=November 2010}} At the same time, an [[Islamism|Islamist]] party, the [[Islamic Party of Malaysia]] (PAS) and a Democratic socialist party, the [[Democratic Action Party (Malaysia)|Democratic Action Party]] (DAP), gained increasing support, at the expense of UMNO and the MCA respectively.<ref name=\"Marshall\"/>\n\nFollowing the end of the [[Malayan Emergency]] in 1960, the predominantly [[Malaysian Chinese|ethnic Chinese]] [[Malayan National Liberation Army]], armed wing of the [[Malayan Communist Party]], had retreated to the Malaysian-Thailand border where it had regrouped and retrained for future offensives against the Malaysian government. The insurgency officially began when the MCP ambushed security forces in [[Kroh|Kroh\u2013Betong]], in the northern part of [[Peninsular Malaysia]], on 17 June 1968. Instead of declaring a \"[[state of emergency]]\" as the British had done previously, the Malaysian government responded to the insurgency by introducing several policy initiatives including the Security and Development Program (KESBAN), ''Rukun Tetangga'' (Neighbourhood Watch), and the [[RELA Corps]] (People\u2019s Volunteer Group).\n\nAt the May 1969 federal elections, the UMNO-MCA-MIC Alliance polled only 48% of the vote, although it retained a majority in the legislature. The MCA lost most of the Chinese-majority seats to Gerakan or DAP candidates. The victorious opposition celebrated by holding a motorcade on the main streets of Kuala Lumpur with supporters holding up brooms as a signal of its intention to make sweeping changes.  Fear of what the changes might mean for them (as much of the country's businesses were Chinese-owned), a Malay backlash resulted, leading rapidly to [[13 May incident|riots and inter-communal violence]] in which about 6,000 Chinese homes and businesses were burned and at least 184 people were killed, although Western diplomatic sources at the time suggested a toll of close to 600, with most of the victims are Chinese.<ref name=\"TIME Art\">{{cite magazine|url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,828327,00.html |title=Malaysia: The Art of Dispelling Anxiety |magazine=Time magazine |date=27 August 1965 |accessdate=26 October 2010}}</ref><ref name=\"Race war\">{{cite magazine|url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,900859,00.html |title=Race War in Malaysia |magazine=Time magazine |date=23 May 1969 |accessdate=26 October 2010}}</ref> The government declared a state of emergency, and a National Operations Council, headed by Deputy Prime Minister [[Tun Abdul Razak]], took power from the government of Tunku Abdul Rahman, who, in September 1970, was forced to retire in favour of Abdul Razak. It consisted of nine members, mostly Malay, and wielded full political and military power.<ref name=\"Marshall\"/>\n\nUsing the Emergency-era [[Internal Security Act (Malaysia)|Internal Security Act]] (ISA), the new government suspended Parliament and political parties, imposed [[Censorship|press censorship]] and placed severe restrictions on political activity. The ISA gave the government power to intern any person indefinitely without trial. These powers were widely used to silence the government's critics, and have never been repealed. The Constitution was changed to make illegal any criticism, even in Parliament, of the Malaysian monarchy, the special position of Malays in the country, or the status of Malay as the national language.\n\nIn 1971 Parliament reconvened, and a new government coalition, the [[National Front (Malaysia)|National Front]] (Barisan Nasional), was formed in 1973 to replace the Alliance party.<ref name=\"Marshall\"/> The coalition consisted of UMNO, the MCA, the MIC, Gerakan, [[People's Progressive Party (Malaysia)|PPP]], and regional parties in Sabah and Sarawak. The PAS also joined the Front but was expelled in 1977. The DAP was left outside as the only significant opposition party. Abdul Razak held office until his death in 1976. He was succeeded by Datuk [[Hussein Onn]], the son of UMNO's founder Onn Jaafar, and then by Tun [[Mahathir Mohamad]], who had been Education Minister since 1981, and who held power for 22 years. During these years policies were put in place which led to the rapid transformation of Malaysia's economy and society, such as the controversial [[Malaysian New Economic Policy|New Economic Policy]], which was intended to increase proportionally the share of the economic \"pie\" of the [[bumiputra]]s as compared to other ethnic groups\u2014was launched by Prime Minister [[Tun Abdul Razak]].

The government's response was the [[New Economic Policy (Malaysia)|New Economic Policy]] of 1971, which was to be implemented through a series of four five-year plans from 1971 to 1990.{{Citation needed|date=November 2010}} The plan had two objectives: the elimination of poverty, particularly rural poverty, and the elimination of the identification between race and prosperity.<ref name=\"Marshall\"/> This latter policy was understood to mean a decisive shift in economic power from the Chinese to the Malays,{{Citation needed|date=November 2010}} who until then made up only 5% of the professional class.<ref name=\"Marshall\"/>\n\nPoverty was tackled through an [[agricultural policy]] which resettled 250,000 Malays on newly cleared farmland, more investment in [[rural infrastructure]], and the creation of [[free trade zone]]s in rural areas to create new manufacturing jobs. Little was done to improve the living standards of the low-paid workers in plantation agriculture, although this group steadily declined as a proportion of the workforce. By 1990 the poorest parts of Malaysia were rural Sabah and Sarawak, which lagged significantly behind the rest of the country. During the 1970s and \u201880s rural poverty did decline, particularly in the Malayan Peninsula, but critics of the government's policy contend that this was mainly due to the growth of overall national prosperity (due in large part to the discovery of important oil and gas reserves) and migration of rural people to the cities rather than to state intervention. These years saw rapid growth in Malaysian cities, particularly Kuala Lumpur, which became a magnet for immigration both from rural Malaya and from poorer neighbours such as Indonesia, [[Bangladesh]], Thailand and the Philippines. Urban poverty became a problem for the first time, with [[shanty town]]s growing up around the cities.{{Citation needed|date=November 2010}}\n\nThe second arm of government policy, driven mainly by Mahathir first as Education Minister and then as Prime Minister, was the transfer of economic power to the Malays. Mahathir greatly expanded the number of secondary schools and universities throughout the country, and enforced the policy of teaching in Malay rather than English. This had the effect of creating a large new Malay professional class. It also created an unofficial barrier against Chinese access to higher education, since few Chinese are sufficiently fluent in [[Malay language|Malay]] to study at Malay-language universities. Chinese families therefore sent their children to universities in Singapore, Australia, Britain or the United States \u2013 by 2000, for example, 60,000 Malaysians held degrees from Australian universities. This had the [[unintended consequence]] of exposing large numbers of Malaysians to life in [[Western world|Western countries]], creating a new source of discontent. Mahathir also greatly expanded educational opportunities for Malay women \u2013 by 2000 half of all university students were women.\n\n[[File:KLCC twin towers2.JPG|thumb|left|[[Petronas Twin Towers]], Kuala Lumpur, the tallest building in Southeast Asia.]]\nTo find jobs for all these new Malay graduates, the government created several agencies for intervention in the economy. The most important of these were PERNAS (National Corporation Ltd.), [[PETRONAS]] (National Petroleum Ltd.), and HICOM (Heavy Industry Corporation of Malaysia), which not only directly employed many Malays but also invested in growing areas of the economy to create new technical and administrative jobs which were preferentially allocated to Malays. As a result, the share of Malay equity in the economy rose from 1.5% in 1969 to 20.3% in 1990, and the percentage of businesses of all kinds owned by Malays rose from 39 percent to 68 percent. This latter figure was deceptive because many businesses that appeared to be Malay-owned were still indirectly controlled by Chinese, but there is no doubt that the Malay share of the economy considerably increased. The Chinese remained disproportionately powerful in Malaysian economic life, but by 2000 the distinction between Chinese and Malay business was fading as many new corporations, particularly in growth sectors such as information technology, were owned and managed by people from both ethnic groups.\n\nMalaysia's rapid [[economic progress]] since 1970, which was only temporarily disrupted by the [[Asian financial crisis]] of 1997, has not been matched by change in [[Politics of Malaysia|Malaysian politics]]. The repressive measures passed in 1970 remain in place. Malaysia has had regular elections since 1974, and although campaigning is reasonably free at election time, it is in effect a [[one-party state]], with the UMNO-controlled National Front usually winning nearly all the seats, while the DAP wins some Chinese urban seats and the PAS some rural Malay ones. Since the DAP and the PAS have diametrically opposed policies, they have been unable to form an effective opposition coalition. There is almost no criticism of the government in the media and public protest remains severely restricted. The ISA continues to be used to silence dissidents, and the members of the UMNO [[youth movement]] are deployed to physically intimidate opponents.\n\n===Mahathir administration===\n[[File:Mahathir Mohamad addressing the United Nations General Assembly (September 25 2003).jpg|right|200px|thumb|alt=A photo showing former Prime Minister Mahatir bin Mohamad standing with head down and surrounded by government officials at the celebration of the 50th independence day.|[[Mahathir Mohamad]] was the leading force in making Malaysia into a major industrial power.]]\nThe restoration of democracy after the 1969 crisis caused disputes in the UMNO, a struggle of power which increased after the death of [[Tun Abdul Razak]].

It was during this period, too, that the physical landscape of Malaysia changed with the emergence of numerous mega-projects. Notable amongst these projects were the construction of the [[Petronas Twin Towers]] (at the time the tallest building in the world, and, as of 2016, still the tallest twin building), [[Kuala Lumpur International Airport]] (KLIA), the [[North\u2013South Expressway (Malaysia)|North\u2013South Expressway]], the [[Sepang International Circuit]], the [[MSC Malaysia|Multimedia Super Corridor]] (MSC), the Bakun hydroelectric dam, and [[Putrajaya]], the new federal administrative capital.\n\nUnder [[Mahathir Mohamad]]\u2019s long Prime Ministership (1981\u20132003), Malaysia's [[political culture]] became increasingly centralised and authoritarian, due to Mahathir's belief that the multiethnic Malaysia could only remain stable through controlled democracy. In 1986\u201387, he faced leadership challenges among his own party. There were also attacks by the government on several [[non-governmental organisation]]s (NGO) which were critical of various government policies.<ref>{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=JSBZ7GffengC&pg=PA36&lpg=PA36#v=onepage&q&f=false |title=Social Movement Malaysia|editor1=Saliha Hassan |editor2=Meredith Weiss |publisher=Routledge |year= 2002 |page=36 |isbn=978-0700716463 }}</ref> There were also issues such the questioning by MCA's [[Lee Kim Sai]] over the use of the term ''[[pendatang]]'' (immigrants) that was seen as challenging Malay's [[bumiputra]] status,<ref>{{cite book |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=v9QEBAAAQBAJ&pg=PA515&lpg=PA515#v=onepage&q&f=false |title=Southeast Asian Personalities of Chinese Descent: A Biographical Dictionary |editor= Leo Suryadinata |author=Lee Kam Hing |page=516 |publisher=Institute of Southeast Asian Studies |year= 2012 |isbn=978-9814345217 }}</ref>  as well as rumours of forced conversion to or from Islam.<ref name=protest>{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=u87MgDuMjbkC&pg=PA124#v=onepage&q&f=false |title=Protest and Possibilities: Civil Society and Coalitions for Political Change in Malaysia |author = Meredith Leigh Weiss |page=124 |publisher=Stanford University Press|year= 2005 |isbn=978-0804752954 }}</ref> Mahathir initiated a crackdown on opposition dissidents with the use of the Internal Security Act named [[Operation Lalang]]. The Internal Security Act was invoked in October 1987 arresting 106 people, including opposition leaders. The head of the judiciary and five members of the supreme court who had questioned his use of the ISA were also arrested, and a clampdown on Malaysia's press occurred.<ref name=\"Marshall\"/>\n\nThis culminated in the dismissal and imprisonment on unsubstantiated charges of the Deputy Prime Minister, [[Anwar Ibrahim]], in 1997 after an internal dispute within the government. The complicity of the judiciary in this piece of persecution was seen as a particularly clear sign of the decline of Malaysian democracy. The Anwar affair led to the formation of a new party, the [[People's Justice Party (Malaysia)|People's Justice Party]], or Keadilan, led by Anwar's wife, [[Wan Azizah Wan Ismail]]. At the 1999 elections Keadilan formed a coalition with the DAP and the PAS known as the Alternative Front ([[Barisan Alternatif]]). The result of this was that the PAS won a number of Malay seats from UMNO, but many Chinese voters disapproved of this unnatural alliance with the Islamist PAS, causing the DAP to lose many of its seats to the MCA, including that of its veteran leader, [[Lim Kit Siang]]. Wan Azizah won her husband's former constituency in Penang but otherwise Keadilan made little impact.\n\nIn the late 1990s, Malaysia was shaken by the [[1997 Asian Financial Crisis|Asian financial crisis]], which damaged Malaysia's assembly line-based economy. Mahathir combated it initially with IMF approved policies. However, the devaluation of the [[Malaysian Ringgit|Ringgit]] and the deepening recession caused him to create his own programme, based on protecting Malaysia from foreign investors and reinvigorating the economy through construction projects and the lowering of interest rates. The policies caused Malaysia's economy to rebound by 2002, but brought disagreement between Mahathir and his deputy, [[Anwar Ibrahim]], who backed the IMF policies.<ref name=\"Marshall\"/> This led to the sacking of the Anwar, causing political unrest.<ref>{{cite news|author=Anthony Spaeth |url=http://www.time.com/time/asia/asia/magazine/1998/980914/cover1.html |title=He's the Boss |publisher=Time Asia Hong Kong |date=14 September 1998 |accessdate=26 October 2010}}</ref> Anwar was arrested and banned from politics on what are considered trumped up charges.<ref name=\"Marshall\"/> In 2003 Mahathir, Malaysia's longest serving prime minister, voluntarily retired in favour of his new deputy, [[Abdullah Ahmad Badawi]].<ref name=\"Marshall\"/> In November 2007 two anti-government rallies occurred, precipitated by allegations of corruption and discrepancies in the election system that heavily favoured the ruling political coalition, [[National Front (Malaysia)|National Front]] ([[Barisan Nasional]]), which has been in power since Malaya achieved independence.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://asiasentinel.com/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=863&Itemid=31 |title=Malaysian Petitioners Defy Police |publisher=Asia Sentinel |accessdate=9 July 2009 |last=Imtiaz Shah Yacob |first=Imran}}</ref>\n\n===Abdullah administration===\nDato Seri [[Abdullah Ahmad Badawi]] freed Anwar,<ref name=\"Marshall\"/> which was seen as a portent of a mild liberalisation.{{Citation needed|date=November 2010}} At the [[2004 Malaysian general election|2004 election]], the National Front led by Abdullah had a massive victory,<ref name=\"Marshall\"/> virtually wiping out the PAS and Keadilan, although the DAP recovered the seats it had lost in 1999. This victory was seen as the result mainly of Abdullah's personal popularity and the strong recovery of Malaysia's economy, which has lifted the living standards of many Malaysians to almost [[first world]] standards, coupled with an ineffective opposition. The government's objective is for Malaysia to become a fully [[developed country]] by 2020 as expressed in ''[[Wawasan 2020]]''. It leaves unanswered, however, the question of when and how Malaysia will acquire a first world [[political system]] (a multi-party democracy, a free press, an [[Judicial independence|independent judiciary]] and the restoration of civil and political liberties) to go with its new economic maturity.\n\nIn November 2007, Malaysia was rocked by two anti-government rallies. The 2007 [[Bersih 2.0 rally|Bersih Rally]] which was attended by 40,000 people was held in Kuala Lumpur on 10 November 2007, to campaign for [[electoral reform]].

Best known in the early 1990s, their trademark was loud [[electronic music|electronic]] tracks with a heavy bass line. On stage and in music videos, (such as the music video for \"Evapor-8\"), Altern-8's members wore face masks and chemical warfare suits. The band signed with [[Network Records]] based in [[Highgate, Birmingham#Stratford House|Stratford House]], [[Birmingham]], [[England]].\n\n==History==\n\n===Nexus 21===\nFormed in 1989, by Mark Archer and Chris Peat, '''Nexus 21''' was a British [[techno]] duo from [[Stafford]], England. <ref>New Straits Times [https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=_7BUAAAAIBAJ&sjid=YJADAAAAIBAJ&dq=nexus-21&pg=5198%2C732961 22 Aug 1992] Retrieved July 2011</ref> The group was signed to the [[Blue Chip record label]], under which they released:\n*''(Still) Life Keeps Moving'': a vocal techno tune, today regarded as an early classic.{{according to whom|date=July 2011}}\n* ''The Rhythm Of Life'': [[LP record|LP]] strongly influenced by Detroit techno with [[acid house]], [[electro (music)|electro]] and [[breakbeat]]s elements.\n\nA second album was set for release in late 1991, but due to sample clearance problems, the LP never materialized. A small edition of [[white labels]] of ''I Know We Can Make It'' / ''Sychologic PSP'' was released, which showcased a bigger [[hardcore techno|hardcore]] influence.\n\nWhen the Blue Chip label folded, the duo moved to [[Network Records]], releasing:\n*''Another Night''\n*''The Detroit remixes''\n\nAfter the release of ''Overload (EP)'', as Altern-8, the pair released the following tracks as Nexus 21:\n*''Self Hypnosis'': a deep techno contribution to the ''Bio Rhythm'' compilation, a remix of which appeared on the ''Progressive Logic'' EP, alongside ''Together'' (from ''Bio Rhythm 2'') and two tunes from ''The Rhythm Of Life'', one remixed.\n\n===The beginning of Altern-8===\n\nAltern-8 was formed in [[Stafford]] in 1990, as a side project to the already successful [[Nexus 21]], (a name chosen because of its \"futuristic house sound\"), when both members were aged 21. From the outset, the band's objective was to develop their style which was influenced by the musical elements of [[Detroit techno]] artists [[Derrick May (musician)|Derrick May]], [[Juan Atkins]] and [[Kevin Saunderson]], as well as the Chicago [[house music]] sound of [[Phuture]] and early electronic pioneers such as [[Kraftwerk]],{{Citation needed|date=January 2011}} although the claim that they were led by American artists at the time is contradictory to the text found in the inlay of their first album, which actually credits Manchester-based British acid house group [[808 State]], by thanking them for starting the UK rave scene.{{Citation needed|date=June 2014}} Nexus 21 produced one album, ''The Rhythm of Life''.\n\nAltern-8 tunes influenced many artists, with their mixture of the sounds of the [[Roland TB-303]], [[Roland TR-808|808]] and [[Roland TR-909|909]] with break-beats and familiar [[Sampling (music)|samples]]. At the time in the UK, outdoor rave events were legal, and Altern-8 had a reputation for turning up to play at major unofficial events. They helped to define harder house tracks relying more heavily on [[Bass (sound)|bass]] and volume. The use of more bass and eclectic noises gradually evolved Altern-8's music away from the earlier house music style. The duo, dressed in chemical warfare suits and dancing \"like electrofied monkeys\", took part in a large number of live performances.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.ctm-festival.de/archive/all-artists/k-o/mark-archer/ | title = \"CTM Berlin\" | access-date = 11 August 2017 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20170811224814/http://www.ctm-festival.de/archive/all-artists/k-o/mark-archer/ | archive-date = 11 August 2017 | url-status = live }}</ref>\n\n===Full On...Mask Hysteria Album===\n\nNotable Altern-8 tracks included \"Activ-8\", \"E-vapor-8\", \"Frequency\", \"Brutal-8-E\", \"Armageddon\", \"Move My Body\", \"Hypnotic St-8\" and \"Infiltrate 202\".<ref name=\"Guardian\">{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/2015/nov/24/cult-heroes-altern-8-rave-music-old-skool|title=Cult heroes: Altern-8, the pop jesters who took rave music to the playground|author=Ben Cardew|date=24 November 2015|publisher=[[Guardian (newspaper)|Guardian]]|accessdate=23 January 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190124102012/https://www.theguardian.com/music/2015/nov/24/cult-heroes-altern-8-rave-music-old-skool|archive-date=24 January 2019|url-status=live}}</ref> The band released an [[album]] on the [[Network Records]] label in 1992, called ''[[Full On...

The album itself is a [[double album]] of various \"old skool\" [[acid house]] and [[rave]] music produced in the late 1980s and early 1990s. The album includes two Altern-8 songs.\n\nAltern 8 under Mark Archer briefly started doing Old School Hardcore reunion events in the late 2000s. Since 2010 they{{fact|date=February 2020}}<!--evidence that Archer and Peat are back together please--> have enjoyed a new resurgence in popularity through a series of live appearances at festivals and clubs across the UK, introducing them to a new generation of fans.\n\nIn 2013, a campaign was launched on [[Facebook]] and [[Twitter]] to get Altern-8's 1991 song \"Activ-8 (Come With Me)\" to number 1 in the chart for Christmas.

These people never wasted their lives waiting for the next punk to arrive. 1988 was their Year Zero. And it's still here. All you have to do is close your eyes.''\n</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote>\n''This is about people with [[Kraftwerk]] and [[DJ Pierre|Pierre]], [[Transmat]] and [[Warp Records|WARP]], 808, 909 and 303 encoded in their DNA.

Best known in the early 1990s, their trademark was loud [[electronic music|electronic]] tracks with a heavy bass line. On stage and in music videos, such as that for \"Evapor-8\", Altern-8's members wore face masks and chemical warfare suits. The band was signed to [[Network Records]] based in [[Highgate, Birmingham#Stratford House|Stratford House]], [[Birmingham]], [[England]].\n\n==History==\n\n===Nexus 21===\n'''Nexus 21''' was a British [[techno]] duo from [[Stafford]], England. This duo was formed in 1989, by Mark Archer and Chris Peat.<ref>New Straits Times [https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=_7BUAAAAIBAJ&sjid=YJADAAAAIBAJ&dq=nexus-21&pg=5198%2C732961 22 Aug 1992] Retrieved July 2011</ref> The group were signed to the [[Blue Chip record label]], under which they released:\n*''(Still) Life Keeps Moving'': a vocal techno tune, today regarded as an early classic.{{according to whom|date=July 2011}}\n* ''The Rhythm Of Life'': [[LP record|LP]] strongly influenced by Detroit techno with [[acid house]], [[electro (music)|electro]] and [[breakbeat]]s elements.\n\nA second album was ready in late 1991, but due to sample clearance problems, the LP never materialized. A small edition of [[white labels]] of ''I Know We Can Make It'' / ''Sychologic PSP'' was released, which showcased a bigger [[hardcore techno|hardcore]] influence.\n\nWhen Blue Chip folded, the duo moved to [[Network Records]], releasing:\n*''Another Night''\n*''The Detroit remixes''\n\nAfter the release of ''Overload (EP)'', as Altern 8, the pair released the following as Nexus 21:\n*''Self Hypnosis'': a deep techno contribution to the ''Bio Rhythm'' compilation, a remix of which appeared on the ''Progressive Logic'' EP, alongside ''Together'' (from ''Bio Rhythm 2'') and two tunes from ''The Rhythm Of Life'', one remixed.\n\n===The beginning of Altern-8===\n\nAltern-8 was formed in [[Stafford]] in 1990, as a side project to the already successful [[Nexus 21]] (a name chosen because of its \"futuristic house sound\"), when both members were aged 21. From the outset, the band's objective was to develop their style which was influenced by the musical elements of [[Detroit techno]] artists [[Derrick May (musician)|Derrick May]], [[Juan Atkins]] and [[Kevin Saunderson]], as well as the Chicago [[house music]] sound of [[Phuture]] and early electronic pioneers such as [[Kraftwerk]],{{Citation needed|date=January 2011}} although the claim that they were led by American artists at the time is completely at odds with the text tribute found in the inlay of their first album, which actually credits Manchester-based British acid house group [[808 State]] by thanking them for starting the UK rave scene.{{Citation needed|date=June 2014}} Nexus 21 produced one album, ''The Rhythm of Life''.\n\nAltern-8 tunes influenced many artists, with their mixture of the sounds of the [[Roland TB-303]], [[Roland TR-808|808]] and [[Roland TR-909|909]] with break-beats and familiar [[Sampling (music)|samples]]. At the time in the UK, outdoor rave events were legal, and Altern-8 had a reputation for turning up to play at major unofficial events. They helped to define harder house tracks relying more heavily on [[Bass (sound)|bass]] and volume. The use of more bass and eclectic noises gradually evolved Altern-8's music away from the earlier house music style. The duo, dressed in chemical warfare suits and dancing \"like electrified monkeys\", took part in a large number of live performances.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.ctm-festival.de/archive/all-artists/k-o/mark-archer/ | title = \"CTM Berlin\" | access-date = 11 August 2017 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20170811224814/http://www.ctm-festival.de/archive/all-artists/k-o/mark-archer/ | archive-date = 11 August 2017 | url-status = live }}</ref>\n\n===Full On...Mask Hysteria Album===\n\nNotable Altern-8 tracks included \"Activ-8\", \"E-vapor-8\", \"Frequency\", \"Brutal-8-E\", \"Armageddon\", \"Move My Body\", \"Hypnotic St-8\" and \"Infiltrate 202\".<ref name=\"Guardian\">{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/2015/nov/24/cult-heroes-altern-8-rave-music-old-skool|title=Cult heroes: Altern-8, the pop jesters who took rave music to the playground|author=Ben Cardew|date=24 November 2015|publisher=[[Guardian (newspaper)|Guardian]]|accessdate=23 January 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190124102012/https://www.theguardian.com/music/2015/nov/24/cult-heroes-altern-8-rave-music-old-skool|archive-date=24 January 2019|url-status=live}}</ref> The band released an [[album]] on the [[Network Records]] label in 1992, called ''[[Full On...

The album itself is a [[double album]] of various \"old skool\" [[acid house]] and [[rave]] music produced in the late 1980s and early 1990s. The album includes two Altern-8 songs.\n\nAltern 8 under Mark Archer briefly started doing Old School Hardcore reunion events in the late 2000s. Since 2010 they{{fact|date=February 2020}}<!--evidence that Archer and Peat areback together please--> have enjoyed a new resurgence in popularity through a series of live appearances at festivals and clubs across the UK, introducing them to a new generation of fans.\n\nIn 2013, a campaign was launched on [[Facebook]] and [[Twitter]] to get Altern-8's 1991 song \"Activ-8 (Come With Me)\" to number 1 in the chart for Christmas. It ultimately ended up charting at number 33.<ref>{{cite news\n |title        = Activ 8 Christmas No1 could be an Altern 8 choice\n |url          = https://www.expressandstar.com/news/2013/11/07/activ-8-christmas-no1-could-be-an-altern-8-choice/\n |accessdate   = 1 December 2013\n |work         = Express and Star\n |date         = 7 November 2013\n |archive-url  = https://web.archive.org/web/20131203004555/http://www.expressandstar.com/news/2013/11/07/activ-8-christmas-no1-could-be-an-altern-8-choice/\n |archive-date = 3 December 2013\n |url-status   = live\n}}</ref>\n\nIn 2020, Altern-8 headlined the Bang Face festival at [[Pontins]] in [[Southport]], the last large music event held in the UK, before advice came from the government advising against gatherings of this kind during the [[2020 coronavirus pandemic in the United Kingdom|coronavirus pandemic]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://bangface.com/weekender2020/ |title=BANG FACE Weekender 2020 |publisher=Bangface.com |date= |accessdate=2020-03-18}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |author=Gabriel Szatan |url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/2020/mar/17/the-last-dance-clubbing-in-the-coronavirus-crisis |title=The last dance: clubbing in the coronavirus crisis &#124; Music |publisher=The Guardian |date= |accessdate=2020-03-18 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200318100709/https://www.theguardian.com/music/2020/mar/17/the-last-dance-clubbing-in-the-coronavirus-crisis |archive-date=18 March 2020 |url-status=live }}</ref>\n\n==Quotation==\nFrom Andrew Harrison of ''[[Select (magazine)|Select]]'' magazine as printed in the Infiltr-8 America ep:\n\n<blockquote>\n''Is it possible to take Altern-8 seriously? It's impossible not to. Because behind the rave pantomime and the giant robots and the mask hysteria, this is music for a different generation. These people never wasted their lives waiting for the next punk to arrive. 1988 was their Year Zero. And it's still here. All you have to do is close your eyes.''\n</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote>\n''This is about people with [[Kraftwerk]] and [[DJ Pierre|Pierre]], [[Transmat]] and [[Warp Records|WARP]], 808, 909 and 303 encoded in their DNA. This is a live transmission of the beat you can't defeat, sampled over and over and hideously mutated. If you don't understand it, you don't deserve to.

It chronicles the lives of the [[List of legendary kings of Britain|kings of the Britons]] over the course of two thousand years, beginning with the [[Troy|Trojans]] founding the [[Britons (historical)|British]] nation and continuing until the [[Anglo-Saxons]] assumed control of much of Britain around the 7th century. It is one of the central pieces of the [[Matter of Britain]].\n\nAlthough taken as historical well into the 16th century,<ref>[[Polydore Vergil]]'s skeptical reading of Geoffrey of Monmouth provoked at first a reaction of denial in England, \"yet the seeds of doubt once sown\" eventually replaced Geoffrey's romances with a new Renaissance historical approach, according to Hans Baron, \"Fifteenth-century civilization and the Renaissance\", in ''The New Cambridge Modern history'', vol. 1 1957:56.</ref> it is now considered to have no value as history. When events described, such as [[Julius Caesar]]'s [[Caesar's invasions of Britain|invasions of Britain]], can be corroborated from contemporary histories, Geoffrey's account can be seen to be wildly inaccurate. It remains, however, a valuable piece of medieval literature, which contains the earliest known version of the story of [[Leir of Britain|King Lear]] and his three daughters, and helped popularise the legend of [[King Arthur]].\n\n==Contents==\n===Dedication===\nGeoffrey starts the book with a statement of his purpose in writing the history: \"I have not been able to discover anything at all on the kings who lived here before the Incarnation of Christ, or indeed about Arthur and all the others who followed on after the Incarnation. Yet the deeds of these men were such that they deserve to be praised for all time.\" He claims that he was given a source for this period by [[Walter of Oxford|Archdeacon Walter]] of Oxford, who presented him with a \"certain very ancient book written in the British language\" from which he has translated his history. He also cites [[Gildas]] and [[Bede]] as sources. Then follows a dedication to [[Robert, 1st Earl of Gloucester|Robert, earl of Gloucester]] and [[Waleran de Beaumont, 1st Earl of Worcester|Waleran, count of Meulan]], whom he enjoins to use their knowledge and wisdom to improve his tale.<ref name=\"Thorpe1966\">{{cite book|last=Thorpe|first=Lewis G.

His great-grandson [[Brutus of Troy|Brutus]] is banished, and, after a period of wandering, is directed by the goddess [[Diana (mythology)|Diana]] to settle on an island in the western ocean. Brutus lands at [[Totnes]] and names the island, then called [[Albion]], \"Britain\" after himself. Brutus defeats the giants who are the only inhabitants of the island, and establishes his capital, Troia Nova, on the banks of the Thames; after his time it is renamed [[London]].\n\n===Book Two===\nWhen Brutus dies, his three sons, Locrinus, Kamber and Albanactus, divide the country between themselves; the three kingdoms are named Loegria (England), Kambria (Wales) and Albany (Scotland). The story then progresses rapidly through the reigns of the descendants of Locrinus, including [[Bladud]], who uses magic and even tries to fly, but dies in the process.\n\nBladud's son [[Leir of Britain|Leir]] reigns for sixty years. He has no sons, so upon reaching old age he decides to divide his kingdom among his three daughters, Goneril, Regan and Cordelia. To decide who should get the largest share, he asks his daughters how much they love him. Goneril and Regan give extravagant answers, but Cordelia answers simply and sincerely; angered, he gives Cordelia no land. Goneril and Regan are to share half the island with their husbands, the Dukes of Albany and Cornwall. Cordelia marries Aganippus, King of the Franks, and departs for Gaul. Soon Goneril and Regan and their husbands rebel and take the whole kingdom. After Leir has had all his attendants taken from him, he begins to regret his actions towards Cordelia and travels to Gaul. Cordelia receives him compassionately and restores his royal robes and retinue. Aganippus raises a Gaulish army for Leir, who returns to Britain, defeats his sons-in-law and regains the kingdom. Leir rules for three years and then dies; Cordelia inherits the throne and rules for five years before Marganus and Cunedagius, her sisters' sons, rebel against her. They imprison Cordelia; grief-stricken, she kills herself. Marganus and Cunedagius divide the kingdom between themselves, but soon quarrel and go to war with each other. Cunedagius eventually kills Marganus in Wales and retains the whole kingdom, ruling for thirty-three years. He is succeeded by his son Rivallo.\n\nA later descendant of Cunedagius, King Gorboduc, has two sons called Ferreux and Porrex. They quarrel and both are eventually killed, sparking a civil war. This leads to Britain being ruled by five kings, who keep attacking each other. [[Dunvallo Molmutius]], the son of Cloten, the King of Cornwall, becomes pre-eminent. He eventually defeats the other kings and establishes his rule over the whole island. He is said to have \"established the so-called [[Molmutine Laws]] which are still famous today among the English\".\n\n===Book Three===\nDunvallo's sons, [[Belinus]] and [[Brennius]], fight a civil war before being reconciled by their mother, and proceed to sack [[Ancient Rome|Rome]]. Victorious, Brennius remains in Italy, while Belinus returns to rule Britain.\n\nNumerous brief accounts of successive kings follow. These include [[Lud son of Heli|Lud]], who renames [[Trinovantum]] \"[[Caer|Kaer]]lud\" after himself; this later becomes corrupted to Lon[[Dun|don]]. Lud is succeeded by his brother, [[Cassivellaunus|Cassibelanus]], as Lud's sons [[Mandubracius|Androgeus]] and [[Tasciovanus|Tenvantius]] are not yet of age. In recompense, Androgeus is made Duke of [[Kent]] and [[Trinovantum]] ([[London]]), and Tenvantius is made Duke of [[Cornwall]].\n\n===Book Four===\nAfter his conquest of Gaul, [[Julius Caesar]] looks over the sea and resolves to order Britain to swear obedience and pay tribute to Rome. His commands are answered by a letter of refusal from Cassivellaunus. Caesar sails a fleet to Britain, but he is overwhelmed by Cassivellaunus's army and forced to retreat to Gaul. Two years later he makes another attempt, but is again pushed back. Then Cassivellaunus quarrels with one of his dukes, Androgeus, who sends a letter to Caesar asking him to help avenge the duke's honour. Caesar invades once more and besieges Cassivellaunus on a hill. After several days Cassivellaunus offers to make peace with Caesar, and Androgeus, filled with remorse, goes to Caesar to plead with him for mercy. Cassivellaunus pays tribute and makes peace with Caesar, who then returns to Gaul.\n\nCassivelaunus dies and is succeeded by his nephew Tenvantius, as Androgeus has gone to Rome. Tenvantius is succeeded in turn by his son [[Cunobelinus|Kymbelinus]], and then Kymbelinus's son [[Guiderius]]. Guiderius refuses to pay tribute to emperor [[Claudius]], who then invades Britain. After [[Guiderius]] is killed in battle with the Romans, his brother [[Arvirargus]] continues the defence, but eventually agrees to submit to Rome, and is given the hand of Claudius's daughter Genvissa in marriage. Claudius returns to Rome, leaving the province under Arviragus's governorship.\n\nThe line of British kings continues under Roman rule, and includes [[Lucius of Britain|Lucius]], Britain's first [[Christianity|Christian]] king, and several Roman figures, including the emperor [[Constantine I]], the usurper [[Allectus]] and the military commander [[Asclepiodotus of Heraclea|Asclepiodotus]]. When Octavius passes the crown to his son-in-law Maximianus, his nephew [[Conan Meriadoc]] is given rule of Brittany to compensate him for not succeeding. After a long period of Roman rule, the Romans decide they no longer wish to defend the island and depart. The Britons are immediately besieged by attacks from Picts, Scots and Danes, especially as their numbers have been depleted due to Conan colonizing Brittany and Maximianus using British troops for his campaigns. In desperation the Britons send letters to the general of the Roman forces, asking for help, but receive no reply (this passage borrows heavily from the corresponding section in Gildas' ''[[De Excidio et Conquestu Britanniae]]'').\n\n===Books Five and Six===\nAfter the Romans leave, the Britons ask the King of Brittany (Armorica), {{ill|Aldroenus|fr|Aldrien}}, descended from Conan, to rule them. However Aldroenus instead sends his brother Constantine to rule the Britons. After Constantine's death [[Vortigern]] assists their eldest son Constans in succeeding, before enabling their murder and coming to power. Constantine's remaining sons [[Ambrosius Aurelianus|Aurelius Ambrosius]] and [[Uther Pendragon|Uther]] are too young to rule and are taken to safety in Amorica. Vortigern invites the [[Anglo-Saxons|Saxons]] under [[Hengest|Hengist]] and [[Horsa]] to fight for him as mercenaries, but they rise against him. He loses control of much of his land and encounters [[Merlin (wizard)|Merlin]].\n\n===Book Seven: The Prophecies of Merlin===\n{{main|Prophetiae Merlini}}\nAt this point Geoffrey abruptly pauses his narrative by inserting a series of prophecies attributed to [[Merlin]]. Some of the prophecies act as an [[epitome]] of upcoming chapters of the ''Historia'', while others are veiled allusions to historical people and events of the [[Norman people|Norman]] world in the 11th-12th centuries. The remainder are obscure.\n\n===Book Eight===\nAfter [[Aurelius Ambrosius]] defeats and kills [[Vortigern]], becoming king, Britain remains in a state of war under him and his brother Uther. They are both assisted by the wizard Merlin. At one point during the continuous string of battles, Ambrosius takes ill and Uther must lead the army for him. This allows an enemy assassin to pose as a physician and poison Ambrosius. When the king dies, a comet taking the form of a dragon's head ([[pendragon]]) appears in the night sky, which Merlin interprets as a sign that Ambrosius is dead and that Uther will be victorious and succeed him. So after defeating his latest enemies, Uther adds \"Pendragon\" to his name and is crowned king.\n\nBut another enemy strikes, forcing Uther to make war again. This time he is temporarily defeated, gaining final victory only with the help of [[Gorlois|Duke Gorlois of Cornwall]]. But while celebrating this victory with Gorlois, he falls in love with the duke's wife, [[Igraine|Igerna]]. This leads to war between Uther Pendragon and Gorlois of Cornwall, during which Uther clandestinely lies with Igerna through the magic of Merlin. [[King Arthur|Arthur]] is conceived that night. Then Gorlois is killed and Uther marries Igerna. But he must war against the Saxons again. Although Uther ultimately triumphs, he dies after drinking water from a spring the Saxons had poisoned.\n\n===Books Nine and Ten===\nUther's son [[King Arthur|Arthur]] assumes the throne and defeats the Saxons so severely that they cease to be a threat until after his death. In the meantime, Arthur conquers most of northern Europe and ushers in a period of peace and prosperity that lasts until the Romans, led by [[Lucius Hiberius]], demands that Britain once again pay tribute to Rome. Arthur defeats Lucius in Gaul, intending to become Emperor, but in his absence, his nephew [[Mordred]] seduces and marries [[Guinevere]] and seizes the throne.\n\n===Books Eleven and Twelve===\nArthur returns and kills Mordred at the [[Battle of Camlann]], but, mortally wounded, he is carried off to the isle of [[Avalon]], and hands the kingdom to his cousin [[Constantine III of Britain|Constantine]], son of [[Cador]] and Duke of Cornwall.\n\nThe Saxons returned after Arthur's death, but would not end the line of British kings until the death of [[Cadwaladr|Cadwallader]]. Cadwallader is forced to flee Britain and requests the aid of King Alan of the Amoricans. However an angel's voice tells him the Britons will no longer rule and he should go to Rome. Cadwallader does so, dying there, though leaves his son and nephew to rule the remaining Britons. The remaining Britons are driven into Wales and the Saxon Athelstan becomes King of Loegria.\n\n==Sources==\n{{see also|Brut y Brenhinedd#Brut Tysilio and Geoffrey's putative British source}}\n\nGeoffrey claimed to have translated the ''Historia'' into Latin from \"a very ancient book in the British tongue\", given to him by [[Walter of Oxford|Walter, Archdeacon of Oxford]].<ref name=\"Thorpeintro\">Thorpe (1966: 14\u201319)</ref><ref>{{cite book|last=Wright|first=Neil|title=The Historia Regum Britannie of Geoffrey of Monmouth|year=1984|publisher=Boydell and Brewer|location=Woodbridge, England|isbn=978-0-85991-641-7|page=xvii}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|last=Lang|first=Andrew|authorlink=Andrew Lang|title=History Of English Literature - From  Beowulf to Swinburne|publisher=Vincent Press|page=45|quote=He says that he has had the advantage of using a book in the Breton tongue which Walter, Archdeacon of Oxford, brought out of Brittany; this book he translates into Latin.|oclc=220536211}}</ref> However, no modern scholars take this claim seriously.<ref name=\"Thorpeintro\"/><ref name=Wright>{{cite book|last=Wright|first=Neil|title=The Historia Regum Britannie of Geoffrey of Monmouth|year=1984|publisher=Boydell and Brewer|location=Woodbridge, England|isbn=978-0-85991-641-7|pages=xvii\u2013xviii|quote=This fusion of heterogeneous sources, which is apparent almost everywhere in the ''Historia'', completely dispels the fiction that the work is no more than a translation of a single Breton (or Welsh) book}}</ref><ref>\"...the ''Historia'' does not bear scrutiny as an authentic history and no scholar today would regard it as such.\": Wright (1984: xxviii)</ref> Much of the work appears to be derived from [[Gildas]]'s 6th-century polemic ''[[De Excidio et Conquestu Britanniae|The Ruin of Britain]]'', [[Bede]]'s 8th-century ''[[Historia ecclesiastica gentis Anglorum|Ecclesiastical History of the English People]]'', the 9th-century ''[[Historia Britonum|History of the Britons]]'' ascribed to [[Nennius]], the 10th-century ''[[Annales Cambriae|Welsh Annals]]'', medieval Welsh genealogies (such as the [[Harleian Genealogies]]) and king-lists, the poems of [[Taliesin]], the Welsh tale ''[[Culhwch and Olwen]]'', and some of the medieval Welsh saints' lives,<ref name=\"Thorpeintro\" /> expanded and turned into a continuous narrative by Geoffrey's own imagination.\n\n==Influence==\nIn an exchange of manuscript material for their own histories, [[Robert of Torigny]] gave [[Henry of Huntington]] a copy of ''Historia Regum Britanniae'', which both Robert and Henry used uncritically as authentic history and subsequently used in their own works,<ref>[[C. Warren Hollister]], ''Henry I'' (Yale English Monarchs), 2001:11 note44.</ref> by which means some of Geoffrey's fictions became embedded in popular history. The history of Geoffrey forms the basis for much [[Great Britain|British]] lore and literature as well as being a rich source of material for [[Welsh language|Welsh]] [[bard]]s. It became tremendously popular during the [[High Middle Ages]], revolutionising views of British history before and during the Anglo-Saxon period despite the criticism of such writers as [[William of Newburgh]] and [[Giraldus Cambrensis|Gerald of Wales]].{{cn|date=November 2017}} The prophecies of Merlin in particular were often drawn on in later periods, for instance by both sides in the issue of [[History of England|English]] influence over [[History of Scotland|Scotland]] under [[Edward I of England|Edward I]] and his successors.{{cn|date=November 2017}}\n\nThe ''Historia'' was quickly translated into [[Norman language|Norman]] verse by [[Wace]] (the ''[[Roman de Brut]]'') in 1155. Wace's version was in turn translated into [[Middle English]] verse by [[Layamon]] (the ''[[Brut (Layamon)|Brut]]'') in the early 13th century. In the second quarter of the 13th century, a version in Latin verse, the ''[[Gesta Regum Britanniae]]'', was produced by [[William of Rennes]]. Material from Geoffrey was incorporated into a large variety of [[Anglo-Norman language|Anglo-Norman]] and [[Middle English]] prose compilations of historical material from the 13th century onward.\n\nGeoffrey was translated into a number of different Welsh prose versions by the end of the 13th century,<ref>A. O. H. Jarman, ''Geoffrey of Monmouth'', University of Wales Press, 1965, p. 17.</ref> collectively known as ''[[Brut y Brenhinedd]]''. One variant of the ''Brut y Brenhinedd'', the so-called ''Brut Tysilio'', was proposed in 1917 by the [[archaeology|archaeologist]] [[William Matthew Flinders Petrie|William Flinders Petrie]] to be the ancient British book that Geoffrey translated,<ref>[[William Matthew Flinders Petrie|Sir William Flinders Petrie]], ''[[s:Neglected British History|Neglected British History]]'', 1917</ref> although the ''Brut'' itself claims to have been translated from Latin by Walter of Oxford, based on his own earlier translation from Welsh to Latin.<ref>William R. Cooper, ''[http://www.annomundi.com/history/chronicle_of_the_early_britons.pdf Chronicle of the Early Britons]'' (pdf), 2002, p. 68</ref> Geoffrey's work is greatly important because it brought the Welsh culture into British society and made it acceptable. It is also the first record we have of the great figure King Lear, and the beginning of the mythical King Arthur figure. \n\nFor centuries, the ''Historia'' was accepted at face value, and much of its material was incorporated into [[Raphael Holinshed|Holinshed]]'s 16th-century ''Chronicles''. Modern historians have regarded the ''Historia'' as a work of fiction with some factual information contained within. [[John Morris (historian)|John Morris]] in ''The Age of Arthur'' calls it a \"deliberate spoof\", although this is based on misidentifying Walter, archdeacon of Oxford, as [[Walter Map]], a satirical writer who lived a century later.<ref>John Morris. ''The Age of Arthur: A History of the British Isles from 350 to 650''. Barnes & Noble Books: New York. 1996 (originally 1973). {{ISBN|0-7607-0243-8}}</ref>\n\nIt continues to have an influence on popular culture. For example, [[Mary Stewart's Merlin Trilogy|Mary Stewart's ''Merlin Trilogy'']] and the TV miniseries ''[[Merlin (miniseries)|Merlin]]'' both contain large elements taken from the ''Historia''.\n\n==Manuscript tradition and textual history==\nTwo hundred and fifteen medieval manuscripts of the ''Historia'' survive, dozens of them copied before the end of the 12th century. Even among the earliest manuscripts a large number of [[Textual criticism|textual]] variants, such as the so-called \"First Variant\", can be discerned. These are reflected in the three possible prefaces to the work and in the presence or absence of certain episodes and phrases. Certain variants may be due to \"authorial\" additions to different early copies, but most probably reflect early attempts to alter, add to or edit the text. Unfortunately, the task of disentangling these variants and establishing Geoffrey's original text is long and complex, and the extent of the difficulties surrounding the text has been established only recently.{{cn|date=November 2017}}\n\nThe variant title ''Historia regum Britanniae'' was introduced in the Middle Ages, and this became the most common form in the modern period. A critical edition of the work published in 2007, however, demonstrated that the most accurate manuscripts refer to the work as ''De gestis Britonum'', and that this was the title Geoffrey himself used to refer to the work.{{sfn|Reeve|2007|p=lix}}\n\n==See also==\n* [[List of legendary kings of Britain]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|30em}}\n\n==Bibliography==\n* {{Cite book| publisher = Boydell Press| isbn = 978-1-84383-206-5| others = Michael D.

It chronicles the lives of the [[List of legendary kings of Britain|kings of the Britons]] over the course of two thousand years, beginning with the [[Troy|Trojans]] founding the [[Britons (historical)|British]] nation and continuing until the [[Anglo-Saxons]] assumed control of much of Britain around the 7th century. It is one of the central pieces of the [[Matter of Britain]].\n\nAlthough taken as historical well into the 16th century,<ref>[[Polydore Vergil]]'s skeptical reading of Geoffrey of Monmouth provoked at first a reaction of denial in England, \"yet the seeds of doubt once sown\" eventually replaced Geoffrey's romances with a new Renaissance historical approach, according to Hans Baron, \"Fifteenth-century civilization and the Renaissance\", in ''The New Cambridge Modern history'', vol. 1 1957:56.</ref> it is now considered to have no value as history. When events described, such as [[Julius Caesar]]'s [[Caesar's invasions of Britain|invasions of Britain]], can be corroborated from contemporary histories, Geoffrey's account can be seen to be wildly inaccurate. It remains, however, a valuable piece of medieval literature, which contains the earliest known version of the story of [[Leir of Britain|King Lear]] and his three daughters, and helped popularise the legend of [[King Arthur]].\n\n==Contents==\n===Dedication===\nGeoffrey starts the book with a statement of his purpose in writing the history: \"I have not been able to discover anything at all on the kings who lived here before the Incarnation of Christ, or indeed about Arthur and all the others who followed on after the Incarnation. Yet the deeds of these men were such that they deserve to be praised for all time.\" He claims that he was given a source for this period by [[Walter of Oxford|Archdeacon Walter]] of Oxford, who presented him with a \"certain very ancient book written in the British language\" from which he has translated his history. He also cites [[Gildas]] and [[Bede]] as sources. Then follows a dedication to [[Robert, 1st Earl of Gloucester|Robert, earl of Gloucester]] and [[Waleran de Beaumont, 1st Earl of Worcester|Waleran, count of Meulan]], whom he enjoins to use their knowledge and wisdom to improve his tale.<ref name=\"Thorpe1966\">{{cite book|last=Thorpe|first=Lewis G.

His great-grandson [[Brutus of Troy|Brutus]] is banished, and, after a period of wandering, is directed by the goddess [[Diana (mythology)|Diana]] to settle on an island in the western ocean. Brutus lands at [[Totnes]] and names the island, then called [[Albion]], \"Britain\" after himself. Brutus defeats the giants who are the only inhabitants of the island, and establishes his capital, Troia Nova, on the banks of the Thames; after his time it is renamed [[London]].\n\n===Book Two===\nWhen Brutus dies, his three sons, Locrinus, Kamber and Albanactus, divide the country between themselves; the three kingdoms are named Loegria (England), Kambria (Wales) and Albany (Scotland). The story then progresses rapidly through the reigns of the descendants of Locrinus, including [[Bladud]], who uses magic and even tries to fly, but dies in the process.\n\nBladud's son [[Leir of Britain|Leir]] reigns for sixty years. He has no sons, so upon reaching old age he decides to divide his kingdom among his three daughters, Goneril, Regan and Cordelia. To decide who should get the largest share, he asks his daughters how much they love him. Goneril and Regan give extravagant answers, but Cordelia answers simply and sincerely; angered, he gives Cordelia no land. Goneril and Regan are to share half the island with their husbands, the Dukes of Albany and Cornwall. Cordelia marries Aganippus, King of the Franks, and departs for Gaul. Soon Goneril and Regan and their husbands rebel and take the whole kingdom. After Leir has had all his attendants taken from him, he begins to regret his actions towards Cordelia and travels to Gaul. Cordelia receives him compassionately and restores his royal robes and retinue. Aganippus raises a Gaulish army for Leir, who returns to Britain, defeats his sons-in-law and regains the kingdom. Leir rules for three years and then dies; Cordelia inherits the throne and rules for five years before Marganus and Cunedagius, her sisters' sons, rebel against her. They imprison Cordelia; grief-stricken, she kills herself. Marganus and Cunedagius divide the kingdom between themselves, but soon quarrel and go to war with each other. Cunedagius eventually kills Marganus in Wales and retains the whole kingdom, ruling for thirty-three years. He is succeeded by his son Rivallo.\n\nA later descendant of Cunedagius, King Gorboduc, has two sons called Ferreux and Porrex. They quarrel and both are eventually killed, sparking a civil war. This leads to Britain being ruled by five kings, who keep attacking each other. [[Dunvallo Molmutius]], the son of Cloten, the King of Cornwall, becomes pre-eminent. He eventually defeats the other kings and establishes his rule over the whole island. He is said to have \"established the so-called [[Molmutine Laws]] which are still famous today among the English\".\n\n===Book Three===\nDunvallo's sons, [[Belinus]] and [[Brennius]], fight a civil war before being reconciled by their mother, and proceed to sack [[Ancient Rome|Rome]]. Victorious, Brennius remains in Italy, while Belinus returns to rule Britain.\n\nNumerous brief accounts of successive kings follow. These include [[Lud son of Heli|Lud]], who renames [[Trinovantum]] \"[[Caer|Kaer]]lud\" after himself; this later becomes corrupted to Lon[[Dun|don]]. Lud is succeeded by his brother, [[Cassivellaunus|Cassibelanus]], as Lud's sons [[Mandubracius|Androgeus]] and [[Tasciovanus|Tenvantius]] are not yet of age. In recompense, Androgeus is made Duke of [[Kent]] and [[Trinovantum]] ([[London]]), and Tenvantius is made Duke of [[Cornwall]].\n\n===Book Four===\nAfter his conquest of Gaul, [[Julius Caesar]] looks over the sea and resolves to order Britain to swear obedience and pay tribute to Rome. His commands are answered by a letter of refusal from Cassivellaunus. Caesar sails a fleet to Britain, but he is overwhelmed by Cassivellaunus's army and forced to retreat to Gaul. Two years later he makes another attempt, but is again pushed back. Then Cassivellaunus quarrels with one of his dukes, Androgeus, who sends a letter to Caesar asking him to help avenge the duke's honour. Caesar invades once more and besieges Cassivellaunus on a hill. After several days Cassivellaunus offers to make peace with Caesar, and Androgeus, filled with remorse, goes to Caesar to plead with him for mercy. Cassivellaunus pays tribute and makes peace with Caesar, who then returns to Gaul.\n\nCassivelaunus dies and is succeeded by his nephew Tenvantius, as Androgeus has gone to Rome. Tenvantius is succeeded in turn by his son [[Cunobelinus|Kymbelinus]], and then Kymbelinus's son [[Guiderius]]. Guiderius refuses to pay tribute to emperor [[Claudius]], who then invades Britain. After [[Guiderius]] is killed in battle with the Romans, his brother [[Arvirargus]] continues the defence, but eventually agrees to submit to Rome, and is given the hand of Claudius's daughter Genvissa in marriage. Claudius returns to Rome, leaving the province under Arviragus's governorship.\n\nThe line of British kings continues under Roman rule, and includes [[Lucius of Britain|Lucius]], Britain's first [[Christianity|Christian]] king, and several Roman figures, including the emperor [[Constantine I]], the usurper [[Allectus]] and the military commander [[Asclepiodotus of Heraclea|Asclepiodotus]]. When Octavius passes the crown to his son-in-law Maximianus, his nephew [[Conan Meriadoc]] is given rule of Brittany to compensate him for not succeeding. After a long period of Roman rule, the Romans decide they no longer wish to defend the island and depart. The Britons are immediately besieged by attacks from Picts, Scots and Danes, especially as their numbers have been depleted due to Conan colonizing Brittany and Maximianus using British troops for his campaigns. In desperation the Britons send letters to the general of the Roman forces, asking for help, but receive no reply (this passage borrows heavily from the corresponding section in Gildas' ''[[De Excidio et Conquestu Britanniae]]'').\n\n===Books Five and Six===\nAfter the Romans leave, the Britons ask the King of Brittany (Armorica), {{ill|Aldroenus|fr|Aldrien}}, descended from Conan, to rule them. However Aldroenus instead sends his brother Constantine to rule the Britons. After Constantine's death [[Vortigern]] assists their eldest son Constans in succeeding, before enabling their murder and coming to power. Constantine's remaining sons [[Ambrosius Aurelianus|Aurelius Ambrosius]] and [[Uther Pendragon|Uther]] are too young to rule and are taken to safety in Amorica. Vortigern invites the [[Anglo-Saxons|Saxons]] under [[Hengest|Hengist]] and [[Horsa]] to fight for him as mercenaries, but they rise against him. He loses control of much of his land and encounters [[Merlin (wizard)|Merlin]].\n\n===Book Seven: The Prophecies of Merlin===\n{{main|Prophetiae Merlini}}\nAt this point Geoffrey abruptly pauses his narrative by inserting a series of prophecies attributed to [[Merlin]]. Some of the prophecies act as an [[epitome]] of upcoming chapters of the ''Historia'', while others are veiled allusions to historical people and events of the [[Norman people|Norman]] world in the 11th-12th centuries. The remainder are obscure.\n\n===Book Eight===\nAfter [[Aurelius Ambrosius]] defeats and kills [[Vortigern]], becoming king, Britain remains in a state of war under him and his brother Uther. They are both assisted by the wizard Merlin. At one point during the continuous string of battles, Ambrosius takes ill and Uther must lead the army for him. This allows an enemy assassin to pose as a physician and poison Ambrosius. When the king dies, a comet taking the form of a dragon's head ([[pendragon]]) appears in the night sky, which Merlin interprets as a sign that Ambrosius is dead and that Uther will be victorious and succeed him. So after defeating his latest enemies, Uther adds \"Pendragon\" to his name and is crowned king.\n\nBut another enemy strikes, forcing Uther to make war again. This time he is temporarily defeated, gaining final victory only with the help of [[Gorlois|Duke Gorlois of Cornwall]]. But while celebrating this victory with Gorlois, he falls in love with the duke's wife, [[Igraine|Igerna]]. This leads to war between Uther Pendragon and Gorlois of Cornwall, during which Uther clandestinely lies with Igerna through the magic of Merlin. [[King Arthur|Arthur]] is conceived that night. Then Gorlois is killed and Uther marries Igerna. But he must war against the Saxons again. Although Uther ultimately triumphs, he dies after drinking water from a spring the Saxons had poisoned.\n\n===Books Nine and Ten===\nUther's son [[King Arthur|Arthur]] assumes the throne and defeats the Saxons so severely that they cease to be a threat until after his death. In the meantime, Arthur conquers most of northern Europe and ushers in a period of peace and prosperity that lasts until the Romans, led by [[Lucius Hiberius]], demands that Britain once again pay tribute to Rome. Arthur defeats Lucius in Gaul, intending to become Emperor, but in his absence, his nephew [[Mordred]] seduces and marries [[Guinevere]] and seizes the throne.\n\n===Books Eleven and Twelve===\nArthur returns and kills Mordred at the [[Battle of Camlann]], but, mortally wounded, he is carried off to the isle of [[Avalon]], and hands the kingdom to his cousin [[Constantine III of Britain|Constantine]], son of [[Cador]] and Duke of Cornwall.\n\nThe Saxons returned after Arthur's death, but would not end the line of British kings until the death of [[Cadwaladr|Cadwallader]]. Cadwallader is forced to flee Britain and requests the aid of King Alan of the Amoricans. However an angel's voice tells him the Britons will no longer rule and he should go to Rome. Cadwallader does so, dying there, though leaves his son and nephew to rule the remaining Britons. The remaining Britons are driven into Wales and the Saxon Athelstan becomes King of Loegria.\n\n==Sources==\n{{see also|Brut y Brenhinedd#Brut Tysilio and Geoffrey's putative British source}}\n\nGeoffrey claimed to have translated the ''Historia'' into Latin from \"a very ancient book in the British tongue\", given to him by [[Walter of Oxford|Walter, Archdeacon of Oxford]].<ref name=\"Thorpeintro\">Thorpe (1966: 14\u201319)</ref><ref>{{cite book|last=Wright|first=Neil|title=The Historia Regum Britannie of Geoffrey of Monmouth|year=1984|publisher=Boydell and Brewer|location=Woodbridge, England|isbn=978-0-85991-641-7|page=xvii}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|last=Lang|first=Andrew|authorlink=Andrew Lang|title=History Of English Literature - From  Beowulf to Swinburne|publisher=Vincent Press|page=45|quote=He says that he has had the advantage of using a book in the Breton tongue which Walter, Archdeacon of Oxford, brought out of Brittany; this book he translates into Latin.|oclc=220536211}}</ref> However, no modern scholars take this claim seriously.<ref name=\"Thorpeintro\"/><ref name=Wright>{{cite book|last=Wright|first=Neil|title=The Historia Regum Britannie of Geoffrey of Monmouth|year=1984|publisher=Boydell and Brewer|location=Woodbridge, England|isbn=978-0-85991-641-7|pages=xvii\u2013xviii|quote=This fusion of heterogeneous sources, which is apparent almost everywhere in the ''Historia'', completely dispels the fiction that the work is no more than a translation of a single Breton (or Welsh) book}}</ref><ref>\"...the ''Historia'' does not bear scrutiny as an authentic history and no scholar today would regard it as such.\": Wright (1984: xxviii)</ref> Much of the work appears to be derived from [[Gildas]]'s 6th-century polemic ''[[De Excidio et Conquestu Britanniae|The Ruin of Britain]]'', [[Bede]]'s 8th-century ''[[Historia ecclesiastica gentis Anglorum|Ecclesiastical History of the English People]]'', the 9th-century ''[[Historia Britonum|History of the Britons]]'' ascribed to [[Nennius]], the 10th-century ''[[Annales Cambriae|Welsh Annals]]'', medieval Welsh genealogies (such as the [[Harleian Genealogies]]) and king-lists, the poems of [[Taliesin]], the Welsh tale ''[[Culhwch and Olwen]]'', and some of the medieval Welsh saints' lives,<ref name=\"Thorpeintro\" /> expanded and turned into a continuous narrative by Geoffrey's own imagination.\n\n==Influence==\nIn an exchange of manuscript material for their own histories, [[Robert of Torigny]] gave [[Henry of Huntington]] a copy of ''Historia Regum Britanniae'', which both Robert and Henry used uncritically as authentic history and subsequently used in their own works,<ref>[[C. Warren Hollister]], ''Henry I'' (Yale English Monarchs), 2001:11 note44.</ref> by which means some of Geoffrey's fictions became embedded in popular history. The history of Geoffrey forms the basis for much [[Great Britain|British]] lore and literature as well as being a rich source of material for [[Welsh language|Welsh]] [[bard]]s. It became tremendously popular during the [[High Middle Ages]], revolutionising views of British history before and during the Anglo-Saxon period despite the criticism of such writers as [[William of Newburgh]] and [[Giraldus Cambrensis|Gerald of Wales]].{{cn|date=November 2017}} The prophecies of Merlin in particular were often drawn on in later periods, for instance by both sides in the issue of [[History of England|English]] influence over [[History of Scotland|Scotland]] under [[Edward I of England|Edward I]] and his successors.{{cn|date=November 2017}}\n\nThe ''Historia'' was quickly translated into [[Norman language|Norman]] verse by [[Wace]] (the ''[[Roman de Brut]]'') in 1155. Wace's version was in turn translated into [[Middle English]] verse by [[Layamon]] (the ''[[Brut (Layamon)|Brut]]'') in the early 13th century. In the second quarter of the 13th century, a version in Latin verse, the ''[[Gesta Regum Britanniae]]'', was produced by [[William of Rennes]]. Material from Geoffrey was incorporated into a large variety of [[Anglo-Norman language|Anglo-Norman]] and [[Middle English]] prose compilations of historical material from the 13th century onward.\n\nGeoffrey was translated into a number of different Welsh prose versions by the end of the 13th century,<ref>A. O. H. Jarman, ''Geoffrey of Monmouth'', University of Wales Press, 1965, p. 17.</ref> collectively known as ''[[Brut y Brenhinedd]]''. One variant of the ''Brut y Brenhinedd'', the so-called ''Brut Tysilio'', was proposed in 1917 by the [[archaeology|archaeologist]] [[William Matthew Flinders Petrie|William Flinders Petrie]] to be the ancient British book that Geoffrey translated,<ref>[[William Matthew Flinders Petrie|Sir William Flinders Petrie]], ''[[s:Neglected British History|Neglected British History]]'', 1917</ref> although the ''Brut'' itself claims to have been translated from Latin by Walter of Oxford, based on his own earlier translation from Welsh to Latin.<ref>William R. Cooper, ''[http://www.annomundi.com/history/chronicle_of_the_early_britons.pdf Chronicle of the Early Britons]'' (pdf), 2002, p. 68</ref> Geoffrey's work is greatly important because it brought the Welsh culture into British society and made it acceptable. It is also the first record we have of the great figure King Lear, and the beginning of the mythical King Arthur figure. \n\nFor centuries, the ''Historia'' was accepted at face value, and much of its material was incorporated into [[Raphael Holinshed|Holinshed]]'s 16th-century ''Chronicles''. Modern historians have regarded the ''Historia'' as a work of fiction with some factual information contained within. [[John Morris (historian)|John Morris]] in ''The Age of Arthur'' calls it a \"deliberate spoof\", although this is based on misidentifying Walter, archdeacon of Oxford, as [[Walter Map]], a satirical writer who lived a century later.<ref>John Morris. ''The Age of Arthur: A History of the British Isles from 350 to 650''. Barnes & Noble Books: New York. 1996 (originally 1973). {{ISBN|0-7607-0243-8}}</ref>\n\nIt continues to have an influence on popular culture. For example, [[Mary Stewart's Merlin Trilogy|Mary Stewart's ''Merlin Trilogy'']] and the TV miniseries ''[[Merlin (miniseries)|Merlin]]'' both contain large elements taken from the ''Historia''.\n\n==Manuscript tradition and textual history==\nTwo hundred and fifteen medieval manuscripts of the ''Historia'' survive, dozens of them copied before the end of the 12th century. Even among the earliest manuscripts a large number of [[Textual criticism|textual]] variants, such as the so-called \"First Variant\", can be discerned. These are reflected in the three possible prefaces to the work and in the presence or absence of certain episodes and phrases. Certain variants may be due to \"authorial\" additions to different early copies, but most probably reflect early attempts to alter, add to or edit the text. Unfortunately, the task of disentangling these variants and establishing Geoffrey's original text is long and complex, and the extent of the difficulties surrounding the text has been established only recently.{{cn|date=November 2017}}\n\nThe variant title ''Historia regum Britanniae'' was introduced in the Middle Ages, and this became the most common form in the modern period. A critical edition of the work published in 2007, however, demonstrated that the most accurate manuscripts refer to the work as ''De gestis Britonum'', and that this was the title Geoffrey himself used to refer to the work.{{sfn|Reeve|2007|p=lix}}\n\n==See also==\n* [[List of legendary kings of Britain]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|30em}}\n\n==Bibliography==\n* {{Cite book| publisher = Boydell Press| isbn = 978-1-84383-206-5| others = Michael D.

The club, founded in 1927, hails from [[Coleraine]], County Lon\n\n\nDerry and plays its home matches at [[The Showgrounds (Coleraine)|The Showgrounds]]. Club colours are blue and white. The club won the [[NIFL Premiership|Irish League]] title once (in [[1973\u201374 Irish League|1973\u201374]]) and the [[Irish Cup]] on six occasions, most recently in 2017\u201318. They are also the only Irish League club to have won two successive all-Ireland competitions, lifting the [[Blaxnit Cup]] in 1969 and 1970. The club is bitter rivals with [[Ballymena United F.C.|Ballymena United]] with their matches being known as the \"North West Derby\".\n\n==History==\nThe original Coleraine Football Club was founded in June 1927 originally called '''Coleraine FC'''  at a meeting in the local Orange hall. The club was formed out of a merger between two local sides: '''Coleraine Olympic''' and '''Coleraine Alexandra'''. The original club colours were all white, hence the club's original nickname \u2013 the Snowmen. Theyclub secured its first trophy in the 1931\u201332 season, defeating [[Ballymena United F.C.|Ballymena United]] 3\u20130 at [[Solitude (football ground)|Solitude]] to win the [[Gold Cup (Northern Ireland)|Gold Cup]].\n\nIn 1948, Coleraine reached its first [[Irish Cup]] final, going down 3\u20130 to [[Linfield F.C.|Linfield]]. 1953 brought another appearance in the final and another defeat, again to Linfield, this time by five goals to nil. The 1950s saw the [[City Cup (Northern Ireland)|City Cup]] won for the first time (1953\u201354) and a second triumph in the [[Gold Cup (Northern Ireland)|Gold Cup]] (1958).\n\nIn 1961, chairman Jack Doherty persuaded [[Bertie Peacock]] to sign for Coleraine after he left [[Celtic F.C.|Celtic]]. It would prove to be one of the most important transfers in the club's history. In 1965, Coleraine won the [[Irish Cup]] for the first time, defeating [[Glenavon F.C.|Glenavon]] 2\u20131 at [[Windsor Park]], with goals from Shaun Dunlop and Derek Irwin. Coleraine thus gained its first experience of European football, against [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] outfit [[FC Dynamo Kyiv|Dynamo Kiev]]. Coleraine also won the first two [[Blaxnit Cup|Blaxnit all-Ireland cup]]s in 1969 and 1970. Coleraine faced [[Kilmarnock F.C.|Kilmarnock]] in the 1970 [[Fairs Cup]], and after a 1\u20131 draw in the first leg, the Bannsiders pulled off an historic 3\u20132 victory thanks to a [[Des Dickson (footballer, born 1948)|Des Dickson]] hat-trick.\n\nIn 1972, the [[Irish Cup]] was won again, this time by beating [[Portadown F.C.|Portadown]] 2\u20131, with goals from Des Dickson and [[Ivan Murray]]. The [[Holy Grail]] of the [[IFA Premiership|Gibson Cup]] was finally captured in 1974. Under the management of Bertie Peacock, the squad consisting of the likes of Des Dickson, Johnny McCurdy, Ivan Murray, Michael Guy and Vince Magee clinched the title ahead of [[Portadown F.C.|Portadown]]. Bertie Peacock resigned in 1974 and Ivan Murray and Johnny McCurdy took over the reins. Murray continued as manager until 1978 and during his spell in charge the [[Irish Cup]] was won twice more \u2013 both times against [[Linfield F.C.|Linfield]]. In 1975, it took three games before a goal from Jim \"Chang\" Smith in the second replay proved decisive. The 1977 victory was more emphatic with [[Liam Beckett]], Des Dickson, Frankie Moffatt and Michael Guy scoring to give Coleraine a 4\u20131 victory. It was to be the club's last major trophy for 26 years.\n\nIn the 1980s there were two more cup finals, in 1982 and 1986, ending in defeats to [[Linfield F.C.|Linfield]] and [[Glentoran F.C.|Glentoran]] respectively. For three seasons in a row in the mid-1980s the club finished second in the league behind Linfield, but in the first part of the 1990s Coleraine struggled. In 1995 they dropped into the First Division. Under [[Kenny Shiels]], Coleraine won the inaugural First Division title and in its first season back in the top flight, won the [[Ulster Cup]] and came agonisingly close to the title, being pipped late on by [[Crusaders F.C.|Crusaders]].\n\nAfter a poor start to the 1999\u201300 season, Shiels resigned and was replaced by Marty Quinn, who rallied the team to finish second in the league behind Linfield and reach the Irish Cup semi-finals and the Coca-Cola Cup final. The next 2 seasons saw Coleraine finish fourth both times \u2013 potential title challenges being ruined by inconsistency. In 2002\u201303, Coleraine ended the season in third place and reached their first Irish Cup Final since 1986. In the final, they faced [[Glentoran F.C.|Glentoran]] as massive underdogs as the east Belfast side were looking to complete a clean sweep of trophies. After an early strike from [[Gareth McAuley]] was harshly ruled out, Coleraine kept going and scored through [[Jody Tolan]]. Despite increasing Glentoran pressure, Coleraine held on and the trophy famine was over. The following season saw the club reach the Irish Cup final again, but this time it was Glentoran who emerged triumphant.\n\nThe club's well-publicised financial problems had already overshadowed much of the 2003\u201304 season (despite a substantial donation from ''Cold Feet'' actor and Coleraine fan [[James Nesbitt]]) and at its end the club was forced to operate on a reduced budget, with several top players leaving. Despite this a top six finish was still achieved. The summer of 2005 saw more budget cuts and several big names leaving the Showgrounds, but this time the main concern for fans was the very future of the club. In August, the [[Inland Revenue]] filed for a winding-up order against Coleraine due to debts of \u00a31.3 million. The Friends of Coleraine, worked tirelessly to persuade the High Court to postpone the hearing to allow them to put together a business plan to show that the club could be viably run. The club were liquidated on 9 August 2006 after they were allowed to enter administration, and a steering committee was set up to run the new club Coleraine FC Ltd.\n\nThe club went on to defeat [[Institute F.C.|Institute]] to win the [[North West Senior Cup]] for the 1st time. The club were incredibly allowed to stay in the Premier League and survival was ensured on the pitch, the Friends of Coleraine formally took control of the club and appointed a new board. In 2008 the club reached the Irish Cup final, but lost 2\u20131 to Linfield. Manager Marty Quinn resigned after that game and his successor, former assistant David Platt, led Coleraine to a fifth-place finish in his first season in charge.\n\nOn 27 March 2010, Coleraine narrowly lost on penalties against Glentoran in the final of the [[Northern Irish League Cup|Co-Operative Insurance Cup]]. They also lost out to Linfield in the semi-finals of the Irish Cup. Despite possessing the two top goalscorers in the league, including 41 goal [[Rory Patterson]], Coleraine could only finish the season in seventh. Despite the arrival of much-travelled English striker [[Leon Knight]], inconsistent form throughout the first half of the 2010\u201311 season resulted in manager David Platt being sacked at the start of February. His replacement, Oran Kearney revitalised a struggling team and they climbed the table rapidly, again ending up seventh.\n\nAn overhaul of the squad over the summer saw Kearney put his mark on the club and the improvement shown in his first four months in charge then continued, with Coleraine performing well in the league and reaching the final of the IRN-BRU League Cup.\n\nIn 2012\u201313 Coleraine finished the season in 6th place after making the split five games previously.\n\nIn the 2015\u201316 season, after many average seasons, the Bannsiders hit title winning form, going on a winning run with it being halted after a while by [[Linfield F.C.|Linfield]]. They started to fall away after that result, being knocked out of the [[Irish Cup]] by 3\u20131 by [[Portadown F.C.|Portadown]] and finished in 5th place and lost the Europa League Play-off by 2\u20131 to [[Glentoran F.C.|Glentoran]].\n\nThe 2016\u20132017 was a fairly good one for the Bannsiders with them currently sitting an impressive 3rd in the table and they also booked their place in the 2017 Irish Cup Final by beating [[Glenavon F.C.|Glenavon]] 2\u20131 to reach their first final in nine years, where they lost 3\u20130 to the double winners [[Linfield F.C.|Linfield]]. \n\nAt the start of the 2017/18 season 'The Bannsiders' made a few new signings. [[Josh Carson]], who came from Linfield originally playing for York City and Ipswich Town, signed for Coleraine as well as Aaron Traynor and Stephen O'Donnell from Warrenpoint Town and Institute respectively. They started their pre-season off well by beating Bangor City 3\u20131. They were then defeated in the Europa League first round qualifier by Haugesund from Norway. During the 2017/18 season, the Bannsiders went on an amazing run, losing once only to [[Linfield F.C.|Linfield]] in the [[NIFL Premiership]], finally finishing in second place, two points behind Crusaders. Although Coleraine did not attain the title, a sixth Irish Cup triumph was secured when they defeated Cliftonville in the final of that competition in May, thanks to the heroics of starlet Aaron Burns. \n\nOran Kearney left the club to take over at [[SPFL Premiership]] side [[St. Mirren F.C.|St. Mirren]] in September 2018, and was replaced by [[Dungannon Swifts F.C.|Dungannon Swifts]] manager Rodney McAree, who guided Coleraine to a sixth-place finish and an Irish Cup semi-final. Following a failure to win the Europa League playoffs, McAree was sacked on 10 May 2019, having only been in charge for eight months. Kearney departed St. Mirren via mutual agreement to rejoin Coleraine as manager on 3 July 2019, citing family reasons and a lack of ambition on his part due to full time football being outside his appetite. Kearney settled back into his role as manager of Coleraine for a second spell. The summer transfer window of 19/20 caused some controversy with Kearney allowing star striker Jamie McGonigle to leave for a paltry sum, of \u00a32,000, while Aaron Burns was also allowed to leave for free, despite Kearney spending \u00a320,000 on the winger 18 months previously. \n\nDespite losing their two best players in McGonigle and Burns, Coleraine started the season well, recording notable victories over reigning Champions and runners ups, Linfield and Ballymena respectively. With the club involved in a five way title race, the club opted to bolster their squad in the January window with the club record signing of Nixon from Carrick for \u00a330,000. \n\n==European record==\n{{main|Northern Irish football clubs in European competitions}}\n\n===Overview===\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

The club, founded in 1927, hails from [[Coleraine]], County Londonderry and plays its home matches at [[The Showgrounds (Coleraine)|The Showgrounds]]. Club colours are blue and white. The club won the [[NIFL Premiership|Irish League]] title once (in [[1973\u201374 Irish League|1973\u201374]]) and the [[Irish Cup]] on six occasions, most recently in 2017\u201318. They are also the only Irish League club to have won two successive all-Ireland competitions, lifting the [[Blaxnit Cup]] in 1969 and 1970. The club is bitter rivals with [[Ballymena United F.C.|Ballymena United]] with their matches being known as the \"North West Derby\".\n\n==History==\nThe original Coleraine Football Club was founded in June 1927 originally called '''Coleraine FC'''  at a meeting in the local Orange hall. The club was formed out of a merger between two local sides: '''Coleraine Olympic''' and '''Coleraine Alexandra'''. The original club colours were all white, hence the club's original nickname \u2013 the Snowmen. Theyclub secured its first trophy in the 1931\u201332 season, defeating [[Ballymena United F.C.|Ballymena United]] 3\u20130 at [[Solitude (football ground)|Solitude]] to win the [[Gold Cup (Northern Ireland)|Gold Cup]].\n\nIn 1948, Coleraine reached its first [[Irish Cup]] final, going down 3\u20130 to [[Linfield F.C.|Linfield]]. 1953 brought another appearance in the final and another defeat, again to Linfield, this time by five goals to nil. The 1950s saw the [[City Cup (Northern Ireland)|City Cup]] won for the first time (1953\u201354) and a second triumph in the [[Gold Cup (Northern Ireland)|Gold Cup]] (1958).\n\nIn 1961, chairman Jack Doherty persuaded [[Bertie Peacock]] to sign for Coleraine after he left [[Celtic F.C.|Celtic]]. It would prove to be one of the most important transfers in the club's history. In 1965, Coleraine won the [[Irish Cup]] for the first time, defeating [[Glenavon F.C.|Glenavon]] 2\u20131 at [[Windsor Park]], with goals from Shaun Dunlop and Derek Irwin. Coleraine thus gained its first experience of European football, against [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] outfit [[FC Dynamo Kyiv|Dynamo Kiev]]. Coleraine also won the first two [[Blaxnit Cup|Blaxnit all-Ireland cup]]s in 1969 and 1970. Coleraine faced [[Kilmarnock F.C.|Kilmarnock]] in the 1970 [[Fairs Cup]], and after a 1\u20131 draw in the first leg, the Bannsiders pulled off an historic 3\u20132 victory thanks to a [[Des Dickson (footballer, born 1948)|Des Dickson]] hat-trick.\n\nIn 1972, the [[Irish Cup]] was won again, this time by beating [[Portadown F.C.|Portadown]] 2\u20131, with goals from Des Dickson and [[Ivan Murray]]. The [[Holy Grail]] of the [[IFA Premiership|Gibson Cup]] was finally captured in 1974. Under the management of Bertie Peacock, the squad consisting of the likes of Des Dickson, Johnny McCurdy, Ivan Murray, Michael Guy and Vince Magee clinched the title ahead of [[Portadown F.C.|Portadown]]. Bertie Peacock resigned in 1974 and Ivan Murray and Johnny McCurdy took over the reins. Murray continued as manager until 1978 and during his spell in charge the [[Irish Cup]] was won twice more \u2013 both times against [[Linfield F.C.|Linfield]]. In 1975, it took three games before a goal from Jim \"Chang\" Smith in the second replay proved decisive. The 1977 victory was more emphatic with [[Liam Beckett]], Des Dickson, Frankie Moffatt and Michael Guy scoring to give Coleraine a 4\u20131 victory. It was to be the club's last major trophy for 26 years.\n\nIn the 1980s there were two more cup finals, in 1982 and 1986, ending in defeats to [[Linfield F.C.|Linfield]] and [[Glentoran F.C.|Glentoran]] respectively. For three seasons in a row in the mid-1980s the club finished second in the league behind Linfield, but in the first part of the 1990s Coleraine struggled. In 1995 they dropped into the First Division. Under [[Kenny Shiels]], Coleraine won the inaugural First Division title and in its first season back in the top flight, won the [[Ulster Cup]] and came agonisingly close to the title, being pipped late on by [[Crusaders F.C.|Crusaders]].\n\nAfter a poor start to the 1999\u201300 season, Shiels resigned and was replaced by Marty Quinn, who rallied the team to finish second in the league behind Linfield and reach the Irish Cup semi-finals and the Coca-Cola Cup final. The next 2 seasons saw Coleraine finish fourth both times \u2013 potential title challenges being ruined by inconsistency. In 2002\u201303, Coleraine ended the season in third place and reached their first Irish Cup Final since 1986. In the final, they faced [[Glentoran F.C.|Glentoran]] as massive underdogs as the east Belfast side were looking to complete a clean sweep of trophies. After an early strike from [[Gareth McAuley]] was harshly ruled out, Coleraine kept going and scored through [[Jody Tolan]]. Despite increasing Glentoran pressure, Coleraine held on and the trophy famine was over. The following season saw the club reach the Irish Cup final again, but this time it was Glentoran who emerged triumphant.\n\nThe club's well-publicised financial problems had already overshadowed much of the 2003\u201304 season (despite a substantial donation from ''Cold Feet'' actor and Coleraine fan [[James Nesbitt]]) and at its end the club was forced to operate on a reduced budget, with several top players leaving. Despite this a top six finish was still achieved. The summer of 2005 saw more budget cuts and several big names leaving the Showgrounds, but this time the main concern for fans was the very future of the club. In August, the [[Inland Revenue]] filed for a winding-up order against Coleraine due to debts of \u00a31.3 million. The Friends of Coleraine, worked tirelessly to persuade the High Court to postpone the hearing to allow them to put together a business plan to show that the club could be viably run. The club were liquidated on 9 August 2006 after they were allowed to enter administration, and a steering committee was set up to run the new club Coleraine FC Ltd.\n\nThe club went on to defeat [[Institute F.C.|Institute]] to win the [[North West Senior Cup]] for the 1st time. The club were incredibly allowed to stay in the Premier League and survival was ensured on the pitch, the Friends of Coleraine formally took control of the club and appointed a new board. In 2008 the club reached the Irish Cup final, but lost 2\u20131 to Linfield. Manager Marty Quinn resigned after that game and his successor, former assistant David Platt, led Coleraine to a fifth-place finish in his first season in charge.\n\nOn 27 March 2010, Coleraine narrowly lost on penalties against Glentoran in the final of the [[Northern Irish League Cup|Co-Operative Insurance Cup]]. They also lost out to Linfield in the semi-finals of the Irish Cup. Despite possessing the two top goalscorers in the league, including 41 goal [[Rory Patterson]], Coleraine could only finish the season in seventh. Despite the arrival of much-travelled English striker [[Leon Knight]], inconsistent form throughout the first half of the 2010\u201311 season resulted in manager David Platt being sacked at the start of February. His replacement, Oran Kearney revitalised a struggling team and they climbed the table rapidly, again ending up seventh.\n\nAn overhaul of the squad over the summer saw Kearney put his mark on the club and the improvement shown in his first four months in charge then continued, with Coleraine performing well in the league and reaching the final of the IRN-BRU League Cup.\n\nIn 2012\u201313 Coleraine finished the season in 6th place after making the split five games previously.\n\nIn the 2015\u201316 season, after many average seasons, the Bannsiders hit title winning form, going on a winning run with it being halted after a while by [[Linfield F.C.|Linfield]]. They started to fall away after that result, being knocked out of the [[Irish Cup]] by 3\u20131 by [[Portadown F.C.|Portadown]] and finished in 5th place and lost the Europa League Play-off by 2\u20131 to [[Glentoran F.C.|Glentoran]].\n\nThe 2016\u20132017 was a fairly good one for the Bannsiders with them currently sitting an impressive 3rd in the table and they also booked their place in the 2017 Irish Cup Final by beating [[Glenavon F.C.|Glenavon]] 2\u20131 to reach their first final in nine years, where they lost 3\u20130 to the double winners [[Linfield F.C.|Linfield]]. \n\nAt the start of the 2017/18 season 'The Bannsiders' made a few new signings. [[Josh Carson]], who came from Linfield originally playing for York City and Ipswich Town, signed for Coleraine as well as Aaron Traynor and Stephen O'Donnell from Warrenpoint Town and Institute respectively. They started their pre-season off well by beating Bangor City 3\u20131. They were then defeated in the Europa League first round qualifier by Haugesund from Norway. During the 2017/18 season, the Bannsiders went on an amazing run, losing once only to [[Linfield F.C.|Linfield]] in the [[NIFL Premiership]], finally finishing in second place, two points behind Crusaders. Although Coleraine did not attain the title, a sixth Irish Cup triumph was secured when they defeated Cliftonville in the final of that competition in May, thanks to the heroics of starlet Aaron Burns. \n\nOran Kearney left the club to take over at [[SPFL Premiership]] side [[St. Mirren F.C.|St. Mirren]] in September 2018, and was replaced by [[Dungannon Swifts F.C.|Dungannon Swifts]] manager Rodney McAree, who guided Coleraine to a sixth-place finish and an Irish Cup semi-final. Following a failure to win the Europa League playoffs, McAree was sacked on 10 May 2019, having only been in charge for eight months. Kearney departed St. Mirren via mutual agreement to rejoin Coleraine as manager on 3 July 2019, citing family reasons and a lack of ambition on his part due to full time football being outside his appetite. Kearney settled back into his role as manager of Coleraine for a second spell. The summer transfer window of 19/20 caused some controversy with Kearney allowing star striker Jamie McGonigle to leave for a paltry sum, of \u00a32,000, while Aaron Burns was also allowed to leave for free, despite Kearney spending \u00a320,000 on the winger 18 months previously. \n\nDespite losing their two best players in McGonigle and Burns, Coleraine started the season well, recording notable victories over reigning Champions and runners ups, Linfield and Ballymena respectively. With the club involved in a five way title race, the club opted to bolster their squad in the January window with the club record signing of Nixon from Carrick for \u00a330,000. \n\n==European record==\n{{main|Northern Irish football clubs in European competitions}}\n\n===Overview===\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!
