Their legendary pride and insubordination is commemorated in a well-known folk song of that time:\n\n<poem>\n\"On a horse they go to church,\nOn a horse they kiss the icons,\nOn a horse they receive communion\nFrom the priest's hand.\"\n</poem>\n\nHis father, [[Konstantinos Kolokotronis]], took part in an armed rebellion, the [[Orlov Revolt]], instigated by the administration of [[Catherine the Great]] of Russia. He was killed in 1780 in an engagement with Ottoman troops, along with two of his brothers, George and Apostolis.<ref>{{harvnb|Kolokotronis|Edmonds|1892}}.</ref> Theodoros was named in honour of [[Fyodor Orlov]].\n\n[[File:Kolokotronis-01d-by-Karl Krazeisen.jpg|thumb|Lithography of Kolokotronis by [[Karl Krazeisen]] used for the 5000 [[drachma]] banknote]]\n\nPrior to the Greek Revolution, Theodoros Kolokotronis operated as a ''kleft'' (a warrior-bandit), an ''[[armatolos]]'' (a Christian irregular of the Ottoman military), and as a ''k\u00e1pos'' (a militiaman employed by Greek notables of the Peloponnese).<ref name=Clogg>{{harvnb|Clogg|2013|loc=\"Biographies: Kolokotronis, Theodoros (1770\u20131843)\", p. 270}}.</ref> As a kapos, Kolokotronis worked for the [[Kanellos Deligiannis|Deligiannis]] family.<ref>{{harvnb|Clogg|1976|p=xviii}}.</ref> He acquired wealth by stealing sheep and marrying the daughter of a wealthy Peloponnesian notable.<ref name=Clogg/>\n\nIn 1805 he joined the Russian Navy during the [[Russo-Turkish War (1806\u20131812)]]. In 1806 Ottoman attacks against the klefts forced Kolokotronis to flee to the island of [[Zakynthos]] (or Zante).<ref name=Clogg/> When Zakynthos was occupied by the [[British Empire|British]], he obtained useful military experience while serving under the command of Richard Church, a [[philhellene]], in the [[1st Regiment Greek Light Infantry]]; in 1810, Kolokotronis was promoted to the rank of major.<ref name=Clogg/> From his service in the British Army, he adopted his characteristic red helmet. While in the Heptanese (a French protectorate from 1807 to 1815, known as the Septinsular Republic), he came in contact with the revolutionary ideas of the era and was influenced by them:\n\n{{cquote|<br>According to my judgement, the [[French Revolution]] and the doings of [[Napoleon]] opened the eyes of the world. The nations knew nothing before, and the people thought that kings were gods upon the earth and that they were bound to say that whatever they did as well done. Through this present change it is more difficult to rule the people.<ref>{{harvnb|Stavrianos|1963|p=195}}.</ref>}}\n\n==Greek War of Independence==   \n===Outbreak===\n[[File:Siege of Tripolitsa.jpg|thumb|Plan of the [[Siege of Tripolitsa]]. The detachments of Kolokotronis's division, which have surrounded the town are symbolized by the letter \"O\".]]\n\nKolokotronis returned to the mainland just prior to the outbreak of the war (officially, 25 March 1821) and formed a confederation of irregular Moreot [[klepht]] bands. These he tried to train and organize into something resembling a modern army. In May, he was named ''[[strategos|archistrategos]]'' or commander-in-chief. He was already 50 years old by this time, a fact which contributed to his sobriquet ''O Geros tou Morea'' or \"The Elder of Morea,\" whereby [[Morea]] was another name describing the [[Peloponnese]]. Kolokotronis's first action was the defense of [[Valtetsi]], the village near [[Tripoli, Greece|Tripoli]] where his army was mustering. Later, he was also the Commander of the Greek forces during the [[Siege of Tripolitsa]]. After the capture of Tripolitsa, he entered the town, where he was shown a [[plane tree]] in the market-place where the Turks used to hang the Greeks and he ordered that it be cut down.\n\n===Siege of Nafplio===\nHe next commanded with [[Demetrios Ypsilantis]] the Greek troops in the siege of the coastal town of [[Nafplion]], since September 1821, and later of the fortress of [[Patras]], since February 1822. \n\nGreek forces took the port of Nafplion, and the Ottoman garrison in the town's twin citadels was running low on supplies, but the disorganized Greek provisional government at [[Argos]], just to the north, could not complete negotiations for its surrender, before a large Ottoman force began marching southward to crush the revolutionaries. Panicked, government officials abandoned Argos and began evacuations by sea at Nafplion. Only an under-strength battalion under [[Demetrios Ypsilantis]] remained to hold Larissa castle, the fortress of Argos. \n\n===As liberator===\n[[File:\u0391\u03bd\u03b4\u03c1\u03b9\u03ac\u03bd\u03c4\u03b1\u03c2 \u03c4\u03bf\u03c5 \u039a\u03bf\u03bb\u03bf\u03ba\u03bf\u03c4\u03c1\u03ce\u03bd\u03b7, \u039d\u03b1\u03cd\u03c0\u03bb\u03b9\u03bf 8209.jpg|thumb|Statue in [[Nafplio]]]]\n[[File:Kolokotronis und seine Soldaten.jpg|thumb|Kolokotronis after the [[Battle of Dervenakia]]]]\n\nKolokotronis gathered the klephts together to march to the relief of Ypsilantis. This was quite a feat in itself, considering the near-collapse of the government and the notoriously quarrelsome nature of the klephtic bands. Even the troublesome [[Souliotes]] lent a hand. The Ottoman army from the north commanded by [[Mahmud Dramali Pasha]], after taking [[Corinth]], had marched to the plain of Argos. The castle of [[Larissa (Argos)|Larissa]] was an excellent position, commanding the whole plain. To leave such a stronghold straddling Ottoman supply lines was far too dangerous. Dramali would have to reduce the fortress before moving on. Scaling the cliffs, breaching the castle's stout walls and overcoming its resolute defenders would be no easy task.\n\nYet, there was one weakness Dramali was unaware of: Larissa, unlike the Acropolis in Athens, had no spring and consequently fresh water had to be supplied from [[cistern]]s. Unfortunately for the Greeks, it was July and no rains were falling to fill the cisterns. Ypsilantis bluffed the Ottomans as long as he could, but towards the end of the month had to sneak his men out in the middle of the night. Dramali's men plundered the castle the next day, and he was now free to march them toward the coast to resupply (the Greeks had pursued a [[scorched earth]] policy, and the large Ottoman force was eating through its food supplies rather quickly). Ypsilantis's defense had bought Kolokotronis and the klephts valuable time.\n\nTo his dismay, Dramali found himself cut off from his supply fleet, which had intended to land at Nafplio but was successfully [[blockade]]d by the Greek fleet under Admiral [[Andreas Miaoulis]]. \n\nDramali reluctantly decided upon a retreat toward Corinth through the [[Dervenaki]] Pass, through which he had just come unmolested. This was exactly what Kolokotronis had been hoping for. In August 1822, his quicker-moving guerrilla forces trapped the Ottomans in the pass and annihilated them in the [[Battle of Dervenakia]].\n\nA devastated Sultan [[Mahmud II]] in [[Constantinople]] was forced to turn to [[Muhammad Ali of Egypt|Muhammad Ali]], ruler of the nominally Ottoman [[Egypt Eyalet|pashaluk of Egypt]], for help.\n\nThe Greeks resumed the siege against the fortresses at Nafplio, which fell in December. Kolokotronis is said to have ridden his horse up the steep slopes of [[Palamidi]] to celebrate his victory there; a statue in the town square commemorates the event. He is attired in the pseudo-classical uniform of the Greek Light Infantry, which he was fond of wearing.\n\n===Parliamentary crisis===\nFrom December 1823 to February 1825, he took part in the [[Greek civil wars of 1824\u20131825|civil wars]] among the various Greek factions; when his party was finally defeated, he was jailed in [[Hydra (island)|Hydra]] with some of his followers in March 1825, and was released only when an Egyptian army under the command of [[Ibrahim Pasha of Egypt|Ibrahim Pasha]] invaded the Morea. His eldest son, [[Panos Kolokotronis]], was killed during the second civil war.\n\n===Against Ibrahim===\n[[File:Kolokotronis statue Athens.jpg|thumb|Statue of Kolokotronis in front of the [[Old Parliament House, Athens|Old Parliament building]] in [[Athens]]; work by [[Lazaros Sochos]]]]\n\nIbrahim was fresh from fighting the [[Wahhabi]] rebels in [[Arabia]], and so was used to fighting guerrillas. His troops were armed with the most modern equipment and trained by European experts. The sultan had promised his father the island of [[Crete]] as an [[appanage]] for young Ibrahim if he could crush the rebels. With his eye on the prize, he burned his way through the Peloponnese, gaining much territory but arousing much hostility in western European [[public opinion]], which in the long run proved disastrous for the Ottomans.\n\nThe island of [[Sphacteria]] and [[Pylos|Navarino]] had already fallen into Ibrahim's hands, and to make matters worse for Kolokotronis, he still had to be on guard against the machinations of Petros Mavromichalis even as he was bracing himself against the new threat. \n\nKolokotronis decided to not confront Ibrahim in an open field battle and used guerrilla tactics and [[Scorched earth|scorched earth]] policy against him; but given his limited resources, was unable to prevent the widespread destruction that Ibrahim left in his wake. Still, in 1825, in recognition of his military acumen and many services to the Greek cause, he was appointed commander-in-chief of Greek forces in the Peloponnese.\n\n==Postbellum activities==\nAfter the war, Kolokotronis became a supporter of Count [[Ioannis Kapodistrias]] and a proponent of alliance with [[Russia]]. When the count was assassinated on 8 October 1831, Kolokotronis created his own administration in support of [[Otto of Greece|Prince Otto of Bavaria]] as a King of Greece. However, later he opposed the [[Bavaria]]n-dominated [[Regent|regency]] during his rule. On 7 June 1834, he was accused, with [[Dimitrios Plapoutas]], for conspiracy against the regency, charged with [[treason]] and sentenced to death, though they were ultimately pardoned in 1835. \n\nTheodoros Kolokotronis died in 1843 in [[Athens]] one day after his son Konstantinos's (Kollinos) wedding and after a feast at the Royal Palace, in presence of [[Otto of Greece|King Otto]].\n\n==Epilogue==\nIn the twilight of his life, Kolokotronis had learned to write in order to complete his [[memoir]]s, which have been a perennial favorite in Greece, and have been translated several times in English and other languages. Kolokotronis's famed helmet, along with the rest of his arms and armor, may today be seen in the [[National Historical Museum of Greece]] in Athens. In addition to the Nafplio statue mentioned earlier, there is another to be seen in Athens, in the forecourt of the [[Old Parliament House, Athens|Old Parliament building]] on [[Stadiou Street]], near [[Syntagma Square]].\n\n==Legacy==\n*Kolokotronis is also the name of military barracks near [[Tripoli, Greece|Tripoli]].\n*\u039a\u03bflokotronis was so famous in popular culture that one can find references about him in strange places, like a gravure sculpted by knife on a stony sterna inside a cave in one of the holes in mount Ntaouli opposite the village [[Lyrkeia]] in the valley of the [[Inachos (river)|Inachos river]].\n*A portrait of Kolokotronis was depicted on the Greek 5000 [[Greek drachma|drachmas]] banknote of 1984\u20132002.<ref>{{cite web|title=Drachma|publisher=Bank of Greece|year=2008|url=http://www.bankofgreece.gr/Pages/en/Euro/drachma.aspx}}</ref>\n\n==Gallery==\n<center>\n<gallery>\nFile:Peytier - Kololotronis and his personal escort.jpg|\"Kololotronis and his personal escort\" by Pierre Peytier\nFile:Kolokotronis uniform.jpg|Kolokotronis' helmet, weapons and equipment, [[Old Parliament House, Athens|Old Parliament House]]\nFile:Evlahos kolokotronis dervenakia.jpg|Statue of Kolokotronis at [[Dervenakia]]\nFile:Kolokotronis Theodore.JPG|Portrait by Dionysios Tsokos\nFile:Kolokotronis.jpg|Colocotroni by Giovanni Boggi\nFile:Theodoros Kolokotronis (1838).jpg|Colocotroni by [[Fran\u00e7ois Pouqueville]]\nFile:Theodoros Kolokotronis monument.jpg|Kolokotronis's monument in the [[First Cemetery of Athens]]\n</gallery>\n</center>\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|2}}\n\n==Sources==\n{{refbegin|2}}\n*{{cite book|last=Clogg|first=Richard|title=The Movement for Greek Independence, 1770\u20131821: A Collection of Documents|year=1976|location=New York|publisher=Barnes & Noble|isbn=978-0-06-491216-7|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=BWJoAAAAMAAJ|ref=harv}}\n*{{cite book|last=Clogg|first=Richard|title=A Concise History of Greece|year=2013|origyear=1992|location=Cambridge and New York|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-1-10-765644-4|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=M492AgAAQBAJ|ref=harv}}\n*{{cite book|last=Fleming|first=K.E.|title=Greece:A Jewish History|year=2008|location=Princeton|publisher=Princeton University Press|isbn=978-1-40-083401-3|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=o3vIneSflMcC|ref=harv}}\n*{{cite book|last=Keridis|first=Dimitris|title=Historical Dictionary of Modern Greece|year=2009|location=|publisher=Scarecrow Press, Inc.|isbn=978-0-81-086312-5|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=3ERJI1jLruQC|ref=harv}}\n*{{cite book|last1=Kolokotronis|first1=Theodoros|last2=Edmonds|first2=Elizabeth M.

Today, Kolokotronis ranks among the most prominent figures in Greece's War of Independence.\n\n==Early life==\nTheodoros Kolokotronis was born at Ramavouni ({{lang|el|\u03a1\u03b1\u03bc\u03b1\u03b2\u03bf\u03cd\u03bd\u03b9}}) in [[Messenia]], and was baptised in Piana, from a family of [[kleft]]s, and grew up in Arcadia in the central Peloponnese where his family originated.<ref name=Keridis>{{harvnb|Keridis|2009|loc=\"Kolokotronis, Theodoros (1770\u20131843)\", pp. 94\u201395}}.</ref><ref>{{harvnb|National Herald|2001|loc=p. 132: \"Theodoros Kolokotronis (1770\u20131843) He came from a family of kleftes and escaped to the island of Zakynthos.\"}}</ref> The Kolokotroneoi were a powerful and respected clan in Arcadia in the 18th century. Their legendary pride and insubordination is commemorated in a well-known folk song of that time:\n\n<poem>\n\"On a horse they go to church,\nOn a horse they kiss the icons,\nOn a horse they receive communion\nFrom the priest's hand.\"\n</poem>\n\nHis father, [[Konstantinos Kolokotronis]], took part in an armed rebellion, the [[Orlov Revolt]], instigated by the administration of [[Catherine the Great]] of Russia. He was killed in 1780 in an engagement with Ottoman troops, along with two of his brothers, George and Apostolis.<ref>{{harvnb|Kolokotronis|Edmonds|1892}}.</ref> Theodoros was named in honour of [[Fyodor Orlov]].\n\n[[File:Kolokotronis-01d-by-Karl Krazeisen.jpg|thumb|Lithography of Kolokotronis by [[Karl Krazeisen]] used for the 5000 [[drachma]] banknote]]\n\nPrior to the Greek Revolution, Theodoros Kolokotronis operated as a ''kleft'' (a warrior-bandit), an ''[[armatolos]]'' (a Christian irregular of the Ottoman military), and as a ''k\u00e1pos'' (a militiaman employed by Greek notables of the Peloponnese).<ref name=Clogg>{{harvnb|Clogg|2013|loc=\"Biographies: Kolokotronis, Theodoros (1770\u20131843)\", p. 270}}.</ref> As a kapos, Kolokotronis worked for the [[Kanellos Deligiannis|Deligiannis]] family.<ref>{{harvnb|Clogg|1976|p=xviii}}.</ref> He acquired wealth by stealing sheep and marrying the daughter of a wealthy Peloponnesian notable.<ref name=Clogg/>\n\nIn 1805 he joined the Russian Navy during the [[Russo-Turkish War (1806\u20131812)]]. In 1806 Ottoman attacks against the klefts forced Kolokotronis to flee to the island of [[Zakynthos]] (or Zante).<ref name=Clogg/> When Zakynthos was occupied by the [[British Empire|British]], he obtained useful military experience while serving under the command of Richard Church, a [[philhellene]], in the [[1st Regiment Greek Light Infantry]]; in 1810, Kolokotronis was promoted to the rank of major.<ref name=Clogg/> From his service in the British Army, he adopted his characteristic red helmet. While in the Heptanese (a French protectorate from 1807 to 1815, known as the Septinsular Republic), he came in contact with the revolutionary ideas of the era and was influenced by them:\n\n{{cquote|<br>According to my judgement, the [[French Revolution]] and the doings of [[Napoleon]] opened the eyes of the world. The nations knew nothing before, and the people thought that kings were gods upon the earth and that they were bound to say that whatever they did as well done. Through this present change it is more difficult to rule the people.<ref>{{harvnb|Stavrianos|1963|p=195}}.</ref>}}\n\n==Greek War of Independence==   \n===Outbreak===\n[[File:Siege of Tripolitsa.jpg|thumb|Plan of the [[Siege of Tripolitsa]]. The detachments of Kolokotronis's division, which have surrounded the town are symbolized by the letter \"O\".]]\n\nKolokotronis returned to the mainland just prior to the outbreak of the war (officially, 25 March 1821) and formed a confederation of irregular Moreot [[klepht]] bands. These he tried to train and organize into something resembling a modern army. In May, he was named ''[[strategos|archistrategos]]'' or commander-in-chief. He was already 50 years old by this time, a fact which contributed to his sobriquet ''O Geros tou Morea'' or \"The Elder of Morea,\" whereby [[Morea]] was another name describing the [[Peloponnese]]. Kolokotronis's first action was the defense of [[Valtetsi]], the village near [[Tripoli, Greece|Tripoli]] where his army was mustering. Later, he was also the Commander of the Greek forces during the [[Siege of Tripolitsa]]. After the capture of Tripolitsa, he entered the town, where he was shown a [[plane tree]] in the market-place where the Turks used to hang the Greeks and he ordered that it be cut down.\n\n===Siege of Nafplio===\nHe next commanded with [[Demetrios Ypsilantis]] the Greek troops in the siege of the coastal town of [[Nafplion]], since September 1821, and later of the fortress of [[Patras]], since February 1822. \n\nGreek forces took the port of Nafplion, and the Ottoman garrison in the town's twin citadels was running low on supplies, but the disorganized Greek provisional government at [[Argos]], just to the north, could not complete negotiations for its surrender, before a large Ottoman force began marching southward to crush the revolutionaries. Panicked, government officials abandoned Argos and began evacuations by sea at Nafplion. Only an under-strength battalion under [[Demetrios Ypsilantis]] remained to hold Larissa castle, the fortress of Argos. \n\n===As liberator===\n[[File:\u0391\u03bd\u03b4\u03c1\u03b9\u03ac\u03bd\u03c4\u03b1\u03c2 \u03c4\u03bf\u03c5 \u039a\u03bf\u03bb\u03bf\u03ba\u03bf\u03c4\u03c1\u03ce\u03bd\u03b7, \u039d\u03b1\u03cd\u03c0\u03bb\u03b9\u03bf 8209.jpg|thumb|Statue in [[Nafplio]]]]\n[[File:Kolokotronis und seine Soldaten.jpg|thumb|Kolokotronis after the [[Battle of Dervenakia]]]]\n\nKolokotronis gathered the klephts together to march to the relief of Ypsilantis. This was quite a feat in itself, considering the near-collapse of the government and the notoriously quarrelsome nature of the klephtic bands. Even the troublesome [[Souliotes]] lent a hand. The Ottoman army from the north commanded by [[Mahmud Dramali Pasha]], after taking [[Corinth]], had marched to the plain of Argos. The castle of [[Larissa (Argos)|Larissa]] was an excellent position, commanding the whole plain. To leave such a stronghold straddling Ottoman supply lines was far too dangerous. Dramali would have to reduce the fortress before moving on. Scaling the cliffs, breaching the castle's stout walls and overcoming its resolute defenders would be no easy task.\n\nYet, there was one weakness Dramali was unaware of: Larissa, unlike the Acropolis in Athens, had no spring and consequently fresh water had to be supplied from [[cistern]]s. Unfortunately for the Greeks, it was July and no rains were falling to fill the cisterns. Ypsilantis bluffed the Ottomans as long as he could, but towards the end of the month had to sneak his men out in the middle of the night. Dramali's men plundered the castle the next day, and he was now free to march them toward the coast to resupply (the Greeks had pursued a [[scorched earth]] policy, and the large Ottoman force was eating through its food supplies rather quickly). Ypsilantis's defense had bought Kolokotronis and the klephts valuable time.\n\nTo his dismay, Dramali found himself cut off from his supply fleet, which had intended to land at Nafplio but was successfully [[blockade]]d by the Greek fleet under Admiral [[Andreas Miaoulis]]. \n\nDramali reluctantly decided upon a retreat toward Corinth through the [[Dervenaki]] Pass, through which he had just come unmolested. This was exactly what Kolokotronis had been hoping for. In August 1822, his quicker-moving guerrilla forces trapped the Ottomans in the pass and annihilated them in the [[Battle of Dervenakia]].\n\nA devastated Sultan [[Mahmud II]] in [[Constantinople]] was forced to turn to [[Muhammad Ali of Egypt|Muhammad Ali]], ruler of the nominally Ottoman [[Egypt Eyalet|pashaluk of Egypt]], for help.\n\nThe Greeks resumed the siege against the fortresses at Nafplio, which fell in December. Kolokotronis is said to have ridden his horse up the steep slopes of [[Palamidi]] to celebrate his victory there; a statue in the town square commemorates the event. He is attired in the pseudo-classical uniform of the Greek Light Infantry, which he was fond of wearing.\n\n===Parliamentary crisis===\nFrom December 1823 to February 1825, he took part in the [[Greek civil wars of 1824\u20131825|civil wars]] among the various Greek factions; when his party was finally defeated, he was jailed in [[Hydra (island)|Hydra]] with some of his followers in March 1825, and was released only when an Egyptian army under the command of [[Ibrahim Pasha of Egypt|Ibrahim Pasha]] invaded the Morea. His eldest son, [[Panos Kolokotronis]], was killed during the second civil war.\n\n===Against Ibrahim===\n[[File:Kolokotronis statue Athens.jpg|thumb|Statue of Kolokotronis in front of the [[Old Parliament House, Athens|Old Parliament building]] in [[Athens]]; work by [[Lazaros Sochos]]]]\n\nIbrahim was fresh from fighting the [[Wahhabi]] rebels in [[Arabia]], and so was used to fighting guerrillas. His troops were armed with the most modern equipment and trained by European experts. The sultan had promised his father the island of [[Crete]] as an [[appanage]] for young Ibrahim if he could crush the rebels. With his eye on the prize, he burned his way through the Peloponnese, gaining much territory but arousing much hostility in western European [[public opinion]], which in the long run proved disastrous for the Ottomans.\n\nThe island of [[Sphacteria]] and [[Pylos|Navarino]] had already fallen into Ibrahim's hands, and to make matters worse for Kolokotronis, he still had to be on guard against the machinations of Petros Mavromichalis even as he was bracing himself against the new threat. \n\nKolokotronis decided to not confront Ibrahim in an open field battle and used guerrilla tactics and [[Scorched earth|scorched earth]] policy against him; but given his limited resources, was unable to prevent the widespread destruction that Ibrahim left in his wake. Still, in 1825, in recognition of his military acumen and many services to the Greek cause, he was appointed commander-in-chief of Greek forces in the Peloponnese.\n\n==Postbellum activities==\nAfter the war, Kolokotronis became a supporter of Count [[Ioannis Kapodistrias]] and a proponent of alliance with [[Russia]]. When the count was assassinated on 8 October 1831, Kolokotronis created his own administration in support of [[Otto of Greece|Prince Otto of Bavaria]] as a King of Greece. However, later he opposed the [[Bavaria]]n-dominated [[Regent|regency]] during his rule. On 7 June 1834, he was accused, with [[Dimitrios Plapoutas]], for conspiracy against the regency, charged with [[treason]] and sentenced to death, though they were ultimately pardoned in 1835. \n\nTheodoros Kolokotronis died in 1843 in [[Athens]] one day after his son Konstantinos's (Kollinos) wedding and after a feast at the Royal Palace, in presence of [[Otto of Greece|King Otto]].\n\n==Epilogue==\nIn the twilight of his life, Kolokotronis had learned to write in order to complete his [[memoir]]s, which have been a perennial favorite in Greece, and have been translated several times in English and other languages. Kolokotronis's famed helmet, along with the rest of his arms and armor, may today be seen in the [[National Historical Museum of Greece]] in Athens. In addition to the Nafplio statue mentioned earlier, there is another to be seen in Athens, in the forecourt of the [[Old Parliament House, Athens|Old Parliament building]] on [[Stadiou Street]], near [[Syntagma Square]].\n\n==Legacy==\n*Kolokotronis is also the name of military barracks near [[Tripoli, Greece|Tripoli]].\n*\u039a\u03bflokotronis was so famous in popular culture that one can find references about him in strange places, like a gravure sculpted by knife on a stony sterna inside a cave in one of the holes in mount Ntaouli opposite the village [[Lyrkeia]] in the valley of the [[Inachos (river)|Inachos river]].\n*A portrait of Kolokotronis was depicted on the Greek 5000 [[Greek drachma|drachmas]] banknote of 1984\u20132002.<ref>{{cite web|title=Drachma|publisher=Bank of Greece|year=2008|url=http://www.bankofgreece.gr/Pages/en/Euro/drachma.aspx}}</ref>\n\n==Gallery==\n<center>\n<gallery>\nFile:Peytier - Kololotronis and his personal escort.jpg|\"Kololotronis and his personal escort\" by Pierre Peytier\nFile:Kolokotronis uniform.jpg|Kolokotronis' helmet, weapons and equipment, [[Old Parliament House, Athens|Old Parliament House]]\nFile:Evlahos kolokotronis dervenakia.jpg|Statue of Kolokotronis at [[Dervenakia]]\nFile:Kolokotronis Theodore.JPG|Portrait by Dionysios Tsokos\nFile:Kolokotronis.jpg|Colocotroni by Giovanni Boggi\nFile:Theodoros Kolokotronis (1838).jpg|Colocotroni by [[Fran\u00e7ois Pouqueville]]\nFile:Theodoros Kolokotronis monument.jpg|Kolokotronis's monument in the [[First Cemetery of Athens]]\n</gallery>\n</center>\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|2}}\n\n==Sources==\n{{refbegin|2}}\n*{{cite book|last=Clogg|first=Richard|title=The Movement for Greek Independence, 1770\u20131821: A Collection of Documents|year=1976|location=New York|publisher=Barnes & Noble|isbn=978-0-06-491216-7|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=BWJoAAAAMAAJ|ref=harv}}\n*{{cite book|last=Clogg|first=Richard|title=A Concise History of Greece|year=2013|origyear=1992|location=Cambridge and New York|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-1-10-765644-4|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=M492AgAAQBAJ|ref=harv}}\n*{{cite book|last=Fleming|first=K.E.|title=Greece:A Jewish History|year=2008|location=Princeton|publisher=Princeton University Press|isbn=978-1-40-083401-3|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=o3vIneSflMcC|ref=harv}}\n*{{cite book|last=Keridis|first=Dimitris|title=Historical Dictionary of Modern Greece|year=2009|location=|publisher=Scarecrow Press, Inc.|isbn=978-0-81-086312-5|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=3ERJI1jLruQC|ref=harv}}\n*{{cite book|last1=Kolokotronis|first1=Theodoros|last2=Edmonds|first2=Elizabeth M.

Although usually situated on a sea coast or estuary, some ports, such as [[Port of Hamburg|Hamburg]], [[Port of Manchester| Manchester]] and [[Duluth]], are many miles inland, with access to the sea via [[river]] or [[canal]]. Because of their roles as a port of entry for immigrants many port cities such as London, New York, Shanghai, Los Angeles, Singapore and Vancouver have experienced dramatic multi-ethnic and multicultural changes.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Encyclopedia of the City|last=Caves|first=R. W.|publisher=Routledge|year=2004|isbn=9780415252256|location=|pages=528}}</ref> \n\nToday, by far the greatest growth in port development is in Asia, the continent with some of the [[World's busiest ports|world's largest and busiest ports]], such as [[Port of Singapore| Singapore]] and the [[China|Chinese]] ports of [[Port of Shanghai| Shanghai]] and [[Port of Ningbo-Zhoushan|Ningbo-Zhoushan]].\n\n==Ancient ports==\n{{main|Historical Ports}}\nWhenever ancient civilisations engaged in maritime trade, they tended to develop sea ports. One of the world's oldest known artificial harbors is at [[Wadi al-Jarf]] on the [[Red Sea]].<ref name=Discovery>{{cite news|title=Most Ancient Port, Hieroglyphic Papyri Found|author=Rossella Lorenzi|work=Discovery News|date=12 April 2013|url=http://news.discovery.com/history/ancient-egypt/worlds-oldest-port-and-egyptian-papyrus-uncovered-130412.htm|accessdate=21 April 2013}}</ref> Along with the finding of harbor structures, ancient anchors have also been found. \n\nOther ancient ports include [[Port of Guangzhou|Guangzhou]] during [[Qin Dynasty]] China and [[Canopus, Egypt|Canopus]], the principal Egyptian port for Greek trade before the foundation of [[Alexandria]]. In ancient Greece, Athens' port of [[Piraeus]] was the base for the Athenian fleet which played a crucial role in the [[Battle of Salamis]] against the Persians in 480 BCE. In ancient India from 3700 BCE, [[Lothal]] was a prominent city of the Indus valley civilisation, located in the Bh\u0101l region of the modern state of [[Gujar\u0101t]].{{reference needed|date=April 2018}} [[Ostia Antica]] was the port of ancient Rome with [[Portus]] established by [[Claudius]] and enlarged by [[Trajan]] to supplement the nearby port of Ostia. In Japan, during the [[Edo period]], the island of [[Dejima]] was the only port open for trade with Europe and received only a single Dutch ship per year, whereas [[Osaka]] was the largest domestic port and the main trade hub for rice.\n\nNowadays, many of these ancient sites no longer exist or function as modern ports. Even in more recent times, ports sometimes fall out of use. [[Rye, East Sussex]], was an important English port in the Middle Ages, but the coastline changed and it is now {{convert|2|mi|km}} from the sea, while the ports of [[Ravenspurn]] and [[Dunwich]] have been lost to [[coastal erosion]].\n\n==Modern ports==\nWhereas early ports tended to be just simple harbours, modern ports tend to be [[Multimodal transport|multimodal]] distribution [[Food hubs|hubs]], with transport links using sea, river, canal, road, rail and air routes. Successful ports are located to optimize access to an active [[hinterland]], such as the [[London Gateway]]. Ideally, a port will grant [[Navigability|easy navigation]] to ships, and will give shelter from wind and waves. Ports are often on estuaries, where the water may be shallow and may need regular [[dredging]]. Deep water ports such as [[Milford Haven Waterway|Milford Haven]]  are less common, but can handle larger ships with a greater draft, such as [[Tanker (ship)|super tankers]], [[Panamax|Post-Panamax vessels]] and large [[container ship]]s. Other businesses such as [[Food hubs|regional distribution centre]]s, warehouses and freight-forwarders, [[canning|canneries]] and other processing facilities find it advantageous to be located within a port or nearby. Modern ports will have specialised [[cargo]]-handling equipment, such as [[Crane (machine)|gantry cranes]], [[Reach stacker|reach stackers]] and [[forklift|forklift trucks]].\n\nPorts usually have specialised functions: some tend to cater mainly for [[passenger ferry|passenger ferries]] and [[cruise ship]]s; some specialise in [[Intermodal container|container]] traffic or general cargo; and some ports play an important military role for their nation's navy. Some third world countries and small islands such as [[Ascension Island|Ascension]] and [[St Helena]] still have limited port facilities, so that ships must anchor off while their cargo and passengers are taken ashore by [[barge]] or [[Launch (boat)|launch]] (respectively).\n\nIn modern times, ports survive  or decline, depending on current economic trends.  In the UK, both the ports of [[Port of Liverpool|Liverpool]] and [[Port of Southampton|Southampton]] were once significant in the transatlantic passenger liner business. Once airliner traffic decimated that trade, both ports diversified to container cargo and cruise ships. Up until the 1950s the [[Port of London]] was a major international port on the [[River Thames]], but changes in shipping and the use of containers and larger ships, have led to its decline.

Those ports that handle containerized cargo are known as container ports. Most cargo ports handle all sorts of cargo, but some ports are very specific as to what cargo they handle. Additionally, the individual cargo ports are divided into different operating terminals which handle the different cargoes, and are operated by different companies, also known as terminal operators or [[stevedore]]s.\n\n====Cruise home port====\nA '''cruise home port''' is the port where cruise ship passengers board (or [[Embarkation|embark]]) to start their cruise and [[disembarkment|disembark]] the cruise ship at the end of their cruise. It is also where the cruise ship's supplies are loaded for the cruise, which includes everything from fresh water and fuel to fruits, vegetables, champagne, and any other supplies needed for the cruise. \"Cruise home ports\" are very busy places during the day the cruise ship is in port, because off-going passengers debark their baggage and on-coming passengers board the ship in addition to all the supplies being loaded. Cruise home ports tend to have large [[passenger terminal (maritime)|passenger terminals]] to handle the large number of passengers passing through the port.

Although usually situated on a sea coast or estuary, some ports, such as [[Port of Hamburg|Hamburg]], [[Port of Manchester| Manchester]] and [[Duluth]], are many miles inland, with access to the sea via [[river]] or [[canal]]. Because of their roles as a port of entry for immigrants many port cities such as London, New York, Shanghai, Los Angeles, Singapore and Vancouver have experienced dramatic multi-ethnic and multicultural changes.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Encyclopedia of the City|last=Caves|first=R.

One of the world's oldest known artificial harbors is at [[Wadi al-Jarf]] on the [[Red Sea]].<ref name=Discovery>{{cite news|title=Most Ancient Port, Hieroglyphic Papyri Found|author=Rossella Lorenzi|work=Discovery News|date=12 April 2013|url=http://news.discovery.com/history/ancient-egypt/worlds-oldest-port-and-egyptian-papyrus-uncovered-130412.htm|accessdate=21 April 2013}}</ref> Along with the finding of harbor structures, ancient anchors have also been found. \n\nOther ancient ports include [[Port of Guangzhou|Guangzhou]] during [[Qin Dynasty]] China and [[Canopus, Egypt|Canopus]], the principal Egyptian port for Greek trade before the foundation of [[Alexandria]]. In ancient Greece, Athens' port of [[Piraeus]] was the base for the Athenian fleet which played a crucial role in the [[Battle of Salamis]] against the Persians in 480 BCE. In ancient India from 3700 BCE, [[Lothal]] was a prominent city of the Indus valley civilisation, located in the Bh\u0101l region of the modern state of [[Gujar\u0101t]].{{reference needed|date=April 2018}} [[Ostia Antica]] was the port of ancient Rome with [[Portus]] established by [[Claudius]] and enlarged by [[Trajan]] to supplement the nearby port of Ostia. In Japan, during the [[Edo period]], the island of [[Dejima]] was the only port open for trade with Europe and received only a single Dutch ship per year, whereas [[Osaka]] was the largest domestic port and the main trade hub for rice.\n\nNowadays, many of these ancient sites no longer exist or function as modern ports. Even in more recent times, ports sometimes fall out of use. [[Rye, East Sussex]], was an important English port in the Middle Ages, but the coastline changed and it is now {{convert|2|mi|km}} from the sea, while the ports of [[Ravenspurn]] and [[Dunwich]] have been lost to [[coastal erosion]].\n\n==Modern ports==\nWhereas early ports tended to be just simple harbours, modern ports tend to be [[Multimodal transport|multimodal]] distribution [[Food hubs|hubs]], with transport links using sea, river, canal, road, rail and air routes. Successful ports are located to optimize access to an active [[hinterland]], such as the [[London Gateway]]. Ideally, a port will grant [[Navigability|easy navigation]] to ships, and will give shelter from wind and waves. Ports are often on estuaries, where the water may be shallow and may need regular [[dredging]]. Deep water ports such as [[Milford Haven Waterway|Milford Haven]]  are less common, but can handle larger ships with a greater draft, such as [[Tanker (ship)|super tankers]], [[Panamax|Post-Panamax vessels]] and large [[container ship]]s. Other businesses such as [[Food hubs|regional distribution centre]]s, warehouses and freight-forwarders, [[canning|canneries]] and other processing facilities find it advantageous to be located within a port or nearby. Modern ports will have specialised [[cargo]]-handling equipment, such as [[Crane (machine)|gantry cranes]], [[Reach stacker|reach stackers]] and [[forklift|forklift trucks]].\n\nPorts usually have specialised functions: some tend to cater mainly for [[passenger ferry|passenger ferries]] and [[cruise ship]]s; some specialise in [[Intermodal container|container]] traffic or general cargo; and some ports play an important military role for their nation's navy. Some third world countries and small islands such as [[Ascension Island|Ascension]] and [[St Helena]] still have limited port facilities, so that ships must anchor off while their cargo and passengers are taken ashore by [[barge]] or [[Launch (boat)|launch]] (respectively).\n\nIn modern times, ports survive  or decline, depending on current economic trends.  In the UK, both the ports of [[Port of Liverpool|Liverpool]] and [[Port of Southampton|Southampton]] were once significant in the transatlantic passenger liner business. Once airliner traffic decimated that trade, both ports diversified to container cargo and cruise ships. Up until the 1950s the [[Port of London]] was a major international port on the [[River Thames]], but changes in shipping and the use of containers and larger ships, have led to its decline.

By contrast, in the UK all ports are in private hands, such as [[The Peel Group|Peel Ports]] who own the Port of Liverpool, [[John Lennon Airport]] and the [[Manchester Ship Canal]]. \n\nEven though modern ships tend to have bow-thrusters and stern-thrusters, many port authorities still require vessels to use [[Maritime pilot|pilot]]s and [[tugboat]]s for manoeuvering large ships in tight quarters.
