The berries of ''A. baetica'' are slightly smaller than those of ''A. belladonna'' and contain fewer seeds, although the seeds themselves are larger than those of ''A. belladonna''.\nWhen not in flower or fruit, differentiation is less easy, but may be achieved by attention to leaf colour and relative pubescence: ''A. baetica'' has yellowish-green foliage and the plant is relatively glabrous, while ''A. belladonna'' is a somewhat pubescent plant with dark green foliage. Furthermore, ''A. baetica'' is a somewhat smaller plant, rarely exceeding 125&nbsp;cm in height, while ''A. belladonna'' often reaches 150&nbsp;cm with occasional very robust specimens reaching 200&nbsp;cm.<ref name= \"floraiberica\" />\n\n==Habitat==\n''Atropa baetica'' grows among the [[undergrowth]] of mixed, upland [[forest]] on dry, sunny, rocky or stony slopes (and also, occasionally, in moister, shadier areas near watercourses) in limy ([[Calcium]]-rich) soils (often in disturbed, nitrogen-rich locations \u2013 see [[Nitrification]] and [[Human impact on the nitrogen cycle]]) at altitudes of 900\u20132,000&nbsp;m. It is not, however, a quick coloniser of recently disturbed areas, preferring instead locations which have been disturbed at some time in the past e.g. the margins of disused or seldom-used paths, [[bridle path]]s and trackways (see [[ridgeway (road)]] and [[Drover's road]]) and also forest clearings, often in rather remote areas. ''A. baetica'' is frequently found growing in woodland of which the conifers ''[[Pinus nigra]]'' subsp. ''salzmanii'' var. ''salzmanii'', ''[[Abies pinsapo]]'' and ''[[Juniperus communis]]'' form major components. Other frequent companion plants include the hawthorn ''[[Crataegus monogyna]]'', the shrubs ''[[Buxus sempervirens]]'', ''[[Viburnum tinus]]'', ''[[Genista scorpius]]'' and ''[[Daphne laureola]]'' \u2013 and the [[tussock (grass)]] ''[[Brachypodium phoenicoides]]''.<ref name= \"Herrera, C. M. (1987)\" />\n\n==Phenology==\n''Atropa baetica'' has a short growing season (around 5 months), favouring sites subjected to heavy winter [[precipitation]] in the form of snowfall and a hot summer/early autumn. The green shoots begin to sprout at ground level in mid-May. Growth (initially very rapid \u2013 stems reaching their full height in a mere 3\u20134 weeks) continues until early August, involving also residual summer growth of small leaf-rosettes (associated with the spread of the clump of [[rhizomes]]) which persist near ground level without giving rise to flowering stems. [[Anthesis]] (flowering) can occur from as early as the third week in June until mid-August, the greatest number of open flowers being present during the first fortnight of July. Unripe berries may be seen from late June up until the third week of September. Ripe berries are present from the beginning of September to mid-October, nearly all being ripe by the end of September.[[Senescence]] is observable between early/mid-September and late October: the first signs of foliar senescence have become noticeable by mid-September and by mid-October practically all plants are reduced to stands of leafless stems, the non -flowering basal rosettes being the last to lose their leaves. The last vestiges of aerial growth disappear shortly after the first rains or heavy falls of snow.<ref name= \"Herrera, C. M. (1987)\" />\n\n==Pollinators==\nThe three insects observed to visit the flowers of ''Atropa baetica'' most regularly are the [[bumblebees]] ''[[Bombus lucorum]]'' L. and ''[[Bombus pascuorum]]'' Scop. and the European honeybee ''[[Apis mellifera]]'' \u2013 all members of the bee family [[Apidae]].\n\nOther [[pollinators]] include, in bee family [[Megachilidae]]: ''[[Anthidium septemdentatum]]'' Latr., ''[[Megachile octosignata]]'' Nyl. and ''[[Megachile lagopoda]]'' L.;\n\nin bee family [[Anthophoridae]]: ''[[Anthophora albigena]]'' Lepeletier, and various ''[[Ceratina]]'' species;\n\nin bee family [[Halictidae]]: ''[[Halictus scabiosae]]'' Rossi and ''[[Lasioglossum albocinctum]]'' Luc.;\n\nand the ant species ''[[Lasius niger]]'' L. In subfamily [[Formicinae]] of the [[Formicidae]].<ref name= \"Herrera, C. M. (1987)\" />\n\n==Insect consumers==\n''Atropa baetica'' is one of the food plants of the [[larva]] of the [[Noctuid]] [[moth]] ''[[Heliothis peltigera]]'' Schiff. However, the toxicity of the leaves before the onset of senescence is such that the moth [[imagoes]] can display developmental abnormalities resulting from larval consumption of the plant e.g. deformities of the wings. The common name of ''H. peltigera'' in German (Bilsenkraut-Bl\u00fcteneule) translates as 'the henbane-blossom owl (moth)',<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.lepiforum.de/lepiwiki.pl?Heliothis_Peltigera|title=Bestimmungshilfe des Lepiforums: Heliothis Peltigera|website=www.lepiforum.de}}</ref> revealing the species' penchant for another plant in the [[Hyoscyameae]] \u2013 namely ''[[Hyoscyamus niger]]'', black henbane \u2013 the chemistry of which is similar to that of ''Atropa baetica''.\n\nSeveral species of [[Hemiptera]] have been observed to feed on the juice of the fruits \u2013 both ripe and unripe: ''[[Spilostethus pandurus]]'' Scop. in family [[Lygaeidae]] and ''[[Carpocoris mediterraneus]]'' Tamanini in family [[Pentatomidae]] suck the sap of developing fruits in August\u2013September, while (more rarely) ''[[Corizus hyoscyami]]'' L. of the [[Rhopalidae]] and ''[[Palomena prasina]]'' L. of the Pentatomidae have been known to suck the juice of the ripe berries in September\u2013October. Very occasionally, ''[[Camptopus lateralis]]'' Germar. of the [[Alydidae]] has been seen to feed on the sap of the leaves.<ref name= \"Herrera, C. M. (1987)\" />\n\nThe [[flea beetle]] ''[[Epitrix atropae]]'' (family [[Chrysomelidae]], tribe Alticini) received its specific name in reference to its feeding upon Atropa species \u2013 chewing a multitude of tiny holes in the leaves..\n\n==Avian consumers==\nLike many other plants bearing juicy, sugar-rich berries full of small seeds,(including other species of Atropa) ''A. baetica'' is dependent on various species of birds as seed-dispersal vectors. Birds transport the berries they have eaten far from the parent plant and the acids and enzymes present in the avian gut serve to break down the seed coat and speed the rate of germination in seeds passed in droppings. The droppings themselves, being rich in Nitrogen, furnish fertiliser to feed the seedlings, once germination has occurred.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.foroconsultivo.org.mx/innovacion.gaceta/los-pi-q-2/411-pajaros-y-frutas-evolucion-y-simbiosis |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2015-12-26 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151227144919/http://www.foroconsultivo.org.mx/innovacion.gaceta/los-pi-q-2/411-pajaros-y-frutas-evolucion-y-simbiosis |archivedate=2015-12-27 }}</ref><ref name= \"rspb.org\">{{cite web|url=http://www.rspb.org.uk/makeahomeforwildlife/advice/expert/previous/deadlynightshade.aspx|title=If you have deadly nightshade in your garden, will it poison the birds?|publisher=}}</ref> The extreme similarity of the berries of ''A. baetica'' to those of ''A. belladonna'' permit the conclusion that the bird species involved in the distribution of the seeds of the two species are almost certainly the same; although (unfortunately) it is rarely possible to observe birds consuming the fruit (of the rarer species) due to the severe damage to ''A. baetica'' caused by ungulates at fruiting time (see below).<ref name= \"Herrera, C. M. (1987)\" /> This conclusion allowed, it may be noted that one of the avian seed vectors for ''A. belladonna'' is [[Turdus philomelos]], the song thrush<ref name= \"rspb.org\" /> and it is likely that other members of the family [[Turdidae]] found in Spain (of which there are a further nine \u2013 see section [[Passeriformes]] in [[List of birds of Spain]])<ref>Thrushes by Peter Clement. Princeton University Press (2001), {{ISBN|978-0-691-08852-5}}.</ref> are involved too. In this connection it is worth mentioning that there is a small, but nonetheless intriguing, piece of evidence, in a [[Plautine]] comedy, that the Roman province of Hispania Baetica may have been famed as a supplier of thrushes, as food, to the tables of Ancient Rome. If this was indeed the case, such intensive bird-trapping could not fail to have had some impact on a plant dependent largely upon thrushes for its propagation by seed. The Tartessian (see [[Tartessos]]) tribe the [[Turdetani]] (''thrush people''?) of the valley of the [[Guadalquivir]] may have been known as such to the Romans by virtue of their trade in these edible songbirds.<ref>''Captivi'' Act 1 Scene 2 verse 162 (and see footnote 5). Ancient Roman comedy by [[Plautus]], Titus Maccius translated by [[Henry Thomas Riley]], 1912. [http://www.gutenberg.org/files/7282/7282.txt www.gutenberg.org]</ref>\nThe berries of ''Atropa belladonna'' have also been reported to be consumed, without harm, by the common pheasant, ''[[Phasianus colchicus]]'' (an introduced species in Spain) \u2013 which is therefore, like the song thrush, likely also to be a consumer of the berries of ''Atropa baetica''.<ref>Press, J.R., Sutton, Dr. D.A., Tebbs, B.R. (principal authors) et al., ed. Davison, Michael W. ''Field Guide to the Wild Flowers of Britain'' \u2013 pub. the Reader's Digest Association Ltd. 1981, reprinted 1997, as part of the ''Reader's Digest Nature Lover's Library''.</ref> In addition to the common pheasant, there are six other bird species ([[partridges]] in the main) placed in the [[phasianidae]] found in Spain (of which four are native and two introduced) which are probable consumers/seed vectors of Atropa species. Like the phasianidae, the domestic chicken is also a member of the order [[Galliformes]] and will feed on Atropa berries if presented with them (- see below in section ''Medicinal Uses'').\n\n==Mammalian consumers==\nNeither vertebrates nor invertebrates consume ''A. baetica'' during the earlier stages of its growth cycle; however, during the month of September, when the onset of senescence causes the levels of tropanes in the aerial parts of the plant to fall, it often sustains severe damage from being browsed by the [[Southeastern Spanish ibex]] ''[[Capra pyrenaica]]'' Schinz. ssp. ''hispanica'' Schimper. Plants are stripped almost bare of leaves, fruit (both ripe and unripe) and even stem tips. Plants damaged in this way respond by producing small rosettes of leaves \u2013 either at ground level or upon the lower third of the flowering stem \u2013 which tend to sustain no further browsing damage before winter dormancy, possibly because of alkaloid levels raised as a defense mechanism activated by the check to growth. Needless to say, the effect of such browsing upon the sexual reproduction of ''A. baetica'' is profound: fewer ripe berries \u2013 and therefore fewer viable seeds \u2013 survive such wholesale destruction and the plants themselves are weakened and effectively undergo a prematurely enforced dormancy.<ref name= \"Herrera, C. M. (1987)\" /> The ibexes do not appear to suffer any ill effects from consuming a plant so rich in toxic alkaloids, which fact (even allowing for the decrease in the plant's toxicity in the month of September) highlights the widely varying susceptibility of different vertebrate species to the poisons involved.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.brickfieldspark.org/data/nightshadedeadly.htm|title=Deadly Nightshade - Atropa belladonna, species information page|website=www.brickfieldspark.org}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Lee | first1 = M.

M. (1987)\"/> that on no occasion did he see evidence that wild boars had been digging up the rhizomes of the plant in order to feed on them \u2013 the rarity of which behaviour he attributes to the boars' rejection of such potentially nutritious, starchy perennating organs (see [[perennation]]), on account of an awareness of their toxicity. In this context it is instructive to consider that wild boars are able to consume, without harm, a variety of plant genera which are toxic (in some cases extremely so) to humans \u2013 most notably [[Aconitum]], a genus yielding some of the most virulently poisonous alkaloids in the plant kingdom.<ref>Baskin, L. & Danell, K.

There is anecdotal evidence that certain [[Suidae]] deliberately consume at least one alkaloidal, plant hallucinogen, becoming highly intoxicated as a result. Indigenous groups in [[Gabon]] claim that they first learned of the psychoactive properties of ''[[Tabernanthe iboga]]'' (now utilised in the [[Bwiti]] religion) by observing wild pigs grubbing up the roots of the shrub, eating them and subsequently exhibiting symptoms of wild excitement.<ref>Furst, Peter T.

The harvesting of the roots and rhizomes has involved the destruction of mature plants, further endangering a species likely never to have been common to start with and now extremely rare.

The chicken was then killed and its meat eaten by a person seeking (as the first author has it) to 'sharpen the faculties of the mind'. For some days the eater of the drugged chicken would show signs of belladonna poisoning, but, when they recovered from this intoxication, would find their faculty of memory greatly enhanced in clarity and retentiveness \u2013 an effect often sought as an aid to the memorising of passages from the [[Quran]] and to [[cramming (education)]] for [[examinations]].<ref name= \"2 docs Font i Quer digital.csic\" /> The same practice (along with another, undertaken for the same purpose, involving drinking the [[milk]] of a [[goat]] fed on Atropa berries) has been recorded more recently with regard to ''Atropa belladonna''.<ref>Boulos, Loutfy ''Medicinal Plants of North Africa'', no.3 in series ''Medicinal Plants of the World'', pub.

By contrast, the most widely used common name for ''Atropa baetica'' in Spanish \u2013 ''tabaco gordo'' i.e. 'stout/big tobacco' \u2013 places the plant in relation, not to the one other species of ''Atropa'' found in Spain, but to plants belonging to a different genus of the family Solanaceae \u2013 namely ''[[Nicotiana]]''. This is also true of most, if not all, of the other common names recorded for ''A. baetica'' in Spain of which the following are listed:  ''tabaco de pastor'' ('[[shepherd]]'s tobacco'), ''tabaco Filipino'' ('[[Filipino people|Filipino]] tobacco') ''tabaco verde'' ('green tobacco')<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.anthos.es|title=Anthos.

That the tobacco-related common names for ''Atropa baetica'' in Spanish cited above demonstrate that the plant really has been smoked as a tobacco substitute in Spain is confirmed by an ethnobotanical observation made by Prof. Font i Quer, who states that ''A. baetica'' is smoked by the shepherds of [[la Sagra]].<ref name= \"2 docs Font i Quer digital.csic\" /> (The geographical designation ''la Sagra'' generally refers in Spain to a part of the [[Geography of Spain#The Inner Plateau and associated mountains|Submeseta Sur]] (a part, in turn of the [[Meseta central]]), although it is possible (given the distribution of ''A. baetica'' ) that the [[Sierra de la Sagra]] (a mountain range further to the South of the Submeseta) may be intended). Font i Quer goes on to compare this smoking of ''A. baetica'' with the occasional smoking of ''A. belladonna'' in the Catalan (i.e. Eastern) part of the [[Pyrenees]] (where one of ''A. belladonna'' 's common names, in the [[Catalan language]] is ''tabac bord'' \u2013 compare name ''tabaco borde'' for ''A. baetica'' in Spanish).<ref name= \"2 docs Font i Quer digital.csic\" /> In neither instance, however, does he enlarge upon his observations, making no mention of the time of year at which the leaves were gathered, whether they were [[Curing of tobacco|cured]] like tobacco or merely dried, how much of the leaf material was smoked at one time etc. \u2013 all of which would affect the amount of tropanes absorbed by these smokers of Atropa leaves and thus the degree of their intoxication.\n\n''Atropa baetica'' is also smoked as a recreational drug in the Rif of Morocco, where \u2013 under the name of ''Tabba'' \u2013 it occasionally forms one of the constituents of the cannabis-based preparation [[kief]],<ref name= \"Merzouki Cannabis 2000\" /> smoked in the traditional [[Sebsi]] \u2013 a small-bowled [[Smoking pipe|pipe]] fitted with a mesh screen.<ref>Maverick Guide to Morocco.

It can hardly be overstressed that ''Atropa baetica'' is an extremely poisonous plant and that the altered state of consciousness produced by its use is better characterised as a [[delirium]] or [[Substance-induced psychosis]]<ref>{{cite journal|title=The Use of Hyoscyamine as a Hallucinogen and Intoxicant|first1=Martin H.|last1=Keeler|first2=Francis J.|last2=Kane|date=1 December 1967|journal=American Journal of Psychiatry|volume=124|issue=6|pages=852\u2013854|doi=10.1176/ajp.124.6.852|pmid = 6061275}}</ref> than as the more lucid and contemplative state evoked by true hallucinogens such as [[LSD]], [[psilocybin]], [[mescaline]] et al.

By contrast, the smoking of Atropa leaves (for purposes other than the relieving of asthma symptoms) does not seem to have been recorded outside the Ibero-Maghrebi area. What the [[transdermal]] absorption route involved in the use of 'flying ointments' and the pulmonary absorption route through smoking have in common is that both techniques allow users a modicum of control over the intoxication that would be more problematic in oral use (ingestion of Atropa is recorded mainly in cases of poisoning \u2013 by the fatally edible-looking berries \u2013 rather than in accounts of hallucinogenic use).\n\nThe smoking, as hallucinogens, of genera of tropane-containing Solanaceae other than Atropa \u2013 alone or as additives to Cannabis preparations \u2013 is not unknown elsewhere and is, in some instances, a practice of considerable antiquity.\nCharred seeds of Hyoscyamus niger have been found at certain prehistoric sites,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bhfieldschool.org/news/did-neolithic-europeans-use-drugs|title=Did Neolithic Europeans Use Drugs?|website=www.bhfieldschool.org}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ancient-wisdom.com/scotlandbalfarg.htm|title=Balfarg, Scotland.|first=Alex|last=Whitaker|website=www.ancient-wisdom.com}}</ref> leaves of ''[[Hyoscyamus muticus]]'' have been smoked by certain [[Bedouin]] tribes<ref>http://wilderness-ventures-egypt.com/2011/04/sakaran-\u0633\u0643\u0631\u0627\u0646/</ref><ref name= \"Ratsch Encyclopedia\">Ratsch, Christian, ''The Encyclopedia of Psychoactive Plants: Ethnopharmacology and Its Applications'' pub.

The berries of ''A. baetica'' are slightly smaller than those of ''A. belladonna'' and contain fewer seeds, although the seeds themselves are larger than those of ''A. belladonna''.\nWhen not in flower or fruit, differentiation is less easy, but may be achieved by attention to leaf colour and relative pubescence: ''A. baetica'' has yellowish-green foliage and the plant is relatively glabrous, while ''A. belladonna'' is a somewhat pubescent plant with dark green foliage. Furthermore, ''A. baetica'' is a somewhat smaller plant, rarely exceeding 125&nbsp;cm in height, while ''A. belladonna'' often reaches 150&nbsp;cm with occasional very robust specimens reaching 200&nbsp;cm.<ref name= \"floraiberica\" />\n\n==Habitat==\n''Atropa baetica'' grows among the [[undergrowth]] of mixed, upland [[forest]] on dry, sunny, rocky or stony slopes (and also, occasionally, in moister, shadier areas near watercourses) in limy ([[Calcium]]-rich) soils (often in disturbed, nitrogen-rich locations \u2013 see [[Nitrification]] and [[Human impact on the nitrogen cycle]]) at altitudes of 900\u20132,000&nbsp;m. It is not, however, a quick coloniser of recently disturbed areas, preferring instead locations which have been disturbed at some time in the past e.g. the margins of disused or seldom-used paths, [[bridle path]]s and trackways (see [[ridgeway (road)]] and [[Drover's road]]) and also forest clearings, often in rather remote areas. ''A. baetica'' is frequently found growing in woodland of which the conifers ''[[Pinus nigra]]'' subsp. ''salzmanii'' var. ''salzmanii'', ''[[Abies pinsapo]]'' and ''[[Juniperus communis]]'' form major components. Other frequent companion plants include the hawthorn ''[[Crataegus monogyna]]'', the shrubs ''[[Buxus sempervirens]]'', ''[[Viburnum tinus]]'', ''[[Genista scorpius]]'' and ''[[Daphne laureola]]'' \u2013 and the [[tussock (grass)]] ''[[Brachypodium phoenicoides]]''.<ref name= \"Herrera, C. M. (1987)\" />\n\n==Phenology==\n''Atropa baetica'' has a short growing season (around 5 months), favouring sites subjected to heavy winter [[precipitation]] in the form of snowfall and a hot summer/early autumn. The green shoots begin to sprout at ground level in mid-May. Growth (initially very rapid \u2013 stems reaching their full height in a mere 3\u20134 weeks) continues until early August, involving also residual summer growth of small leaf-rosettes (associated with the spread of the clump of [[rhizomes]]) which persist near ground level without giving rise to flowering stems. [[Anthesis]] (flowering) can occur from as early as the third week in June until mid-August, the greatest number of open flowers being present during the first fortnight of July. Unripe berries may be seen from late June up until the third week of September. Ripe berries are present from the beginning of September to mid-October, nearly all being ripe by the end of September.[[Senescence]] is observable between early/mid-September and late October: the first signs of foliar senescence have become noticeable by mid-September and by mid-October practically all plants are reduced to stands of leafless stems, the non -flowering basal rosettes being the last to lose their leaves. The last vestiges of aerial growth disappear shortly after the first rains or heavy falls of snow.<ref name= \"Herrera, C. M. (1987)\" />\n\n==Pollinators==\nThe three insects observed to visit the flowers of ''Atropa baetica'' most regularly are the [[bumblebees]] ''[[Bombus lucorum]]'' L. and ''[[Bombus pascuorum]]'' Scop. and the European honeybee ''[[Apis mellifera]]'' \u2013 all members of the bee family [[Apidae]].\n\nOther [[pollinators]] include, in bee family [[Megachilidae]]: ''[[Anthidium septemdentatum]]'' Latr., ''[[Megachile octosignata]]'' Nyl. and ''[[Megachile lagopoda]]'' L.;\n\nin bee family [[Anthophoridae]]: ''[[Anthophora albigena]]'' Lepeletier, and various ''[[Ceratina]]'' species;\n\nin bee family [[Halictidae]]: ''[[Halictus scabiosae]]'' Rossi and ''[[Lasioglossum albocinctum]]'' Luc.;\n\nand the ant species ''[[Lasius niger]]'' L. In subfamily [[Formicinae]] of the [[Formicidae]].<ref name= \"Herrera, C. M. (1987)\" />\n\n==Insect consumers==\n''Atropa baetica'' is one of the food plants of the [[larva]] of the [[Noctuid]] [[moth]] ''[[Heliothis peltigera]]'' Schiff. However, the toxicity of the leaves before the onset of senescence is such that the moth [[imagoes]] can display developmental abnormalities resulting from larval consumption of the plant e.g. deformities of the wings. The common name of ''H. peltigera'' in German (Bilsenkraut-Bl\u00fcteneule) translates as 'the henbane-blossom owl (moth)',<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.lepiforum.de/lepiwiki.pl?Heliothis_Peltigera|title=Bestimmungshilfe des Lepiforums: Heliothis Peltigera|website=www.lepiforum.de}}</ref> revealing the species' penchant for another plant in the [[Hyoscyameae]] \u2013 namely ''[[Hyoscyamus niger]]'', black henbane \u2013 the chemistry of which is similar to that of ''Atropa baetica''.\n\nSeveral species of [[Hemiptera]] have been observed to feed on the juice of the fruits \u2013 both ripe and unripe: ''[[Spilostethus pandurus]]'' Scop. in family [[Lygaeidae]] and ''[[Carpocoris mediterraneus]]'' Tamanini in family [[Pentatomidae]] suck the sap of developing fruits in August\u2013September, while (more rarely) ''[[Corizus hyoscyami]]'' L. of the [[Rhopalidae]] and ''[[Palomena prasina]]'' L. of the Pentatomidae have been known to suck the juice of the ripe berries in September\u2013October. Very occasionally, ''[[Camptopus lateralis]]'' Germar. of the [[Alydidae]] has been seen to feed on the sap of the leaves.<ref name= \"Herrera, C. M. (1987)\" />\n\nThe [[flea beetle]] ''[[Epitrix atropae]]'' (family [[Chrysomelidae]], tribe Alticini) received its specific name in reference to its feeding upon Atropa species \u2013 chewing a multitude of tiny holes in the leaves..\n\n==Avian consumers==\nLike many other plants bearing juicy, sugar-rich berries full of small seeds,(including other species of Atropa) ''A. baetica'' is dependent on various species of birds as seed-dispersal vectors. Birds transport the berries they have eaten far from the parent plant and the acids and enzymes present in the avian gut serve to break down the seed coat and speed the rate of germination in seeds passed in droppings. The droppings themselves, being rich in Nitrogen, furnish fertiliser to feed the seedlings, once germination has occurred.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.foroconsultivo.org.mx/innovacion.gaceta/los-pi-q-2/411-pajaros-y-frutas-evolucion-y-simbiosis |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2015-12-26 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151227144919/http://www.foroconsultivo.org.mx/innovacion.gaceta/los-pi-q-2/411-pajaros-y-frutas-evolucion-y-simbiosis |archivedate=2015-12-27 }}</ref><ref name= \"rspb.org\">{{cite web|url=http://www.rspb.org.uk/makeahomeforwildlife/advice/expert/previous/deadlynightshade.aspx|title=If you have deadly nightshade in your garden, will it poison the birds?|publisher=}}</ref> The extreme similarity of the berries of ''A. baetica'' to those of ''A. belladonna'' permit the conclusion that the bird species involved in the distribution of the seeds of the two species are almost certainly the same; although (unfortunately) it is rarely possible to observe birds consuming the fruit (of the rarer species) due to the severe damage to ''A. baetica'' caused by ungulates at fruiting time (see below).<ref name= \"Herrera, C. M. (1987)\" /> This conclusion allowed, it may be noted that one of the avian seed vectors for ''A. belladonna'' is [[Turdus philomelos]], the song thrush<ref name= \"rspb.org\" /> and it is likely that other members of the family [[Turdidae]] found in Spain (of which there are a further nine \u2013 see section [[Passeriformes]] in [[List of birds of Spain]])<ref>Thrushes by Peter Clement. Princeton University Press (2001), {{ISBN|978-0-691-08852-5}}.</ref> are involved too. In this connection it is worth mentioning that there is a small, but nonetheless intriguing, piece of evidence, in a [[Plautine]] comedy, that the Roman province of Hispania Baetica may have been famed as a supplier of thrushes, as food, to the tables of Ancient Rome. If this was indeed the case, such intensive bird-trapping could not fail to have had some impact on a plant dependent largely upon thrushes for its propagation by seed. The Tartessian (see [[Tartessos]]) tribe the [[Turdetani]] (''thrush people''?) of the valley of the [[Guadalquivir]] may have been known as such to the Romans by virtue of their trade in these edible songbirds.<ref>''Captivi'' Act 1 Scene 2 verse 162 (and see footnote 5). Ancient Roman comedy by [[Plautus]], Titus Maccius translated by [[Henry Thomas Riley]], 1912. [http://www.gutenberg.org/files/7282/7282.txt www.gutenberg.org]</ref>\nThe berries of ''Atropa belladonna'' have also been reported to be consumed, without harm, by the common pheasant, ''[[Phasianus colchicus]]'' (an introduced species in Spain) \u2013 which is therefore, like the song thrush, likely also to be a consumer of the berries of ''Atropa baetica''.<ref>Press, J.R., Sutton, Dr. D.A., Tebbs, B.R. (principal authors) et al., ed. Davison, Michael W. ''Field Guide to the Wild Flowers of Britain'' \u2013 pub. the Reader's Digest Association Ltd. 1981, reprinted 1997, as part of the ''Reader's Digest Nature Lover's Library''.</ref> In addition to the common pheasant, there are six other bird species ([[partridges]] in the main) placed in the [[phasianidae]] found in Spain (of which four are native and two introduced) which are probable consumers/seed vectors of Atropa species. Like the phasianidae, the domestic chicken is also a member of the order [[Galliformes]] and will feed on Atropa berries if presented with them (- see below in section ''Medicinal Uses'').\n\n==Mammalian consumers==\nNeither vertebrates nor invertebrates consume ''A. baetica'' during the earlier stages of its growth cycle; however, during the month of September, when the onset of senescence causes the levels of tropanes in the aerial parts of the plant to fall, it often sustains severe damage from being browsed by the [[Southeastern Spanish ibex]] ''[[Capra pyrenaica]]'' Schinz. ssp. ''hispanica'' Schimper. Plants are stripped almost bare of leaves, fruit (both ripe and unripe) and even stem tips. Plants damaged in this way respond by producing small rosettes of leaves \u2013 either at ground level or upon the lower third of the flowering stem \u2013 which tend to sustain no further browsing damage before winter dormancy, possibly because of alkaloid levels raised as a defense mechanism activated by the check to growth. Needless to say, the effect of such browsing upon the sexual reproduction of ''A. baetica'' is profound: fewer ripe berries \u2013 and therefore fewer viable seeds \u2013 survive such wholesale destruction and the plants themselves are weakened and effectively undergo a prematurely enforced dormancy.<ref name= \"Herrera, C. M. (1987)\" /> The ibexes do not appear to suffer any ill effects from consuming a plant so rich in toxic alkaloids, which fact (even allowing for the decrease in the plant's toxicity in the month of September) highlights the widely varying susceptibility of different vertebrate species to the poisons involved.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.brickfieldspark.org/data/nightshadedeadly.htm|title=Deadly Nightshade - Atropa belladonna, species information page|website=www.brickfieldspark.org}}</ref><ref>Lee, M.

M. (1987)\"/> that on no occasion did he see evidence that wild boars had been digging up the rhizomes of the plant in order to feed on them \u2013 the rarity of which behaviour he attributes to the boars' rejection of such potentially nutritious, starchy perennating organs (see [[perennation]]), on account of an awareness of their toxicity. In this context it is instructive to consider that wild boars are able to consume, without harm, a variety of plant genera which are toxic (in some cases extremely so) to humans \u2013 most notably [[Aconitum]], a genus yielding some of the most virulently poisonous alkaloids in the plant kingdom.<ref>Baskin, L. & Danell, K.

There is anecdotal evidence that certain [[Suidae]] deliberately consume at least one alkaloidal, plant hallucinogen, becoming highly intoxicated as a result. Indigenous groups in [[Gabon]] claim that they first learned of the psychoactive properties of ''[[Tabernanthe iboga]]'' (now utilised in the [[Bwiti]] religion) by observing wild pigs grubbing up the roots of the shrub, eating them and subsequently exhibiting symptoms of wild excitement.<ref>Furst, Peter T.

The harvesting of the roots and rhizomes has involved the destruction of mature plants, further endangering a species likely never to have been common to start with and now extremely rare.

One author<ref>[http://uses.plantnet-project.org/fr/Solanac\u00e9es_(Bellakhdar ]{{dead link|date=October 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }})</ref> maintains this to be due to a confusion (due to a similarity between certain Moroccan names of the plants in question) with ''[[Anacardium occidentale]]'' L., but this is belied by an ethnobotanical note on A. baetica by the estimable Prof. Font i Quer, who recorded a practice whereby a chicken was fed with Atropa berries until its flesh was judged to be sufficiently saturated with the plant's poisons (or metabolites thereof?) The chicken was then killed and its meat eaten by a person seeking (as the first author has it) to 'sharpen the faculties of the mind'. For some days the eater of the drugged chicken would show signs of belladonna poisoning, but, when they recovered from this intoxication, would find their faculty of memory greatly enhanced in clarity and retentiveness \u2013 an effect often sought as an aid to the memorising of passages from the [[Quran]] and to [[cramming (education)]] for [[examinations]].<ref name= \"2 docs Font i Quer digital.csic\" /> The same practice (along with another, undertaken for the same purpose, involving drinking the [[milk]] of a [[goat]] fed on Atropa berries) has been recorded more recently with regard to ''Atropa belladonna''.<ref>Boulos, Loutfy ''Medicinal Plants of North Africa'', no.3 in series ''Medicinal Plants of the World'', pub.

This is also true of most, if not all, of the other common names recorded for ''A. baetica'' in Spain of which the following are listed:  ''tabaco de pastor'' ('[[shepherd]]'s tobacco'), ''tabaco Filipino'' ('[[Filipino people|Filipino]] tobacco') ''tabaco verde'' ('green tobacco')<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.anthos.es|title=Anthos.

That the tobacco-related common names for ''Atropa baetica'' in Spanish cited above demonstrate that the plant really has been smoked as a tobacco substitute in Spain is confirmed by an ethnobotanical observation made by Prof. Font i Quer, who states that ''A. baetica'' is smoked by the shepherds of [[la Sagra]].<ref name= \"2 docs Font i Quer digital.csic\" /> (The geographical designation ''la Sagra'' generally refers in Spain to a part of the [[Geography of Spain#The Inner Plateau and associated mountains|Submeseta Sur]] (a part, in turn of the [[Meseta central]]), although it is possible (given the distribution of ''A. baetica'' ) that the [[Sierra de la Sagra]] (a mountain range further to the South of the Submeseta) may be intended). Font i Quer goes on to compare this smoking of ''A. baetica'' with the occasional smoking of ''A. belladonna'' in the Catalan (i.e. Eastern) part of the [[Pyrenees]] (where one of ''A. belladonna'' 's common names, in the [[Catalan language]] is ''tabac bord'' \u2013 compare name ''tabaco borde'' for ''A. baetica'' in Spanish).<ref name= \"2 docs Font i Quer digital.csic\" /> In neither instance, however, does he enlarge upon his observations, making no mention of the time of year at which the leaves were gathered, whether they were [[Curing of tobacco|cured]] like tobacco or merely dried, how much of the leaf material was smoked at one time etc. \u2013 all of which would affect the amount of tropanes absorbed by these smokers of Atropa leaves and thus the degree of their intoxication.\n\n''Atropa baetica'' is also smoked as a recreational drug in the Rif of Morocco, where \u2013 under the name of ''Tabba'' \u2013 it occasionally forms one of the constituents of the cannabis-based preparation [[kief]],<ref name= \"Merzouki Cannabis 2000\" /> smoked in the traditional [[Sebsi]] \u2013 a small-bowled [[Smoking pipe|pipe]] fitted with a mesh screen.<ref>Maverick Guide to Morocco.

It can hardly be overstressed that ''Atropa baetica'' is an extremely poisonous plant and that the altered state of consciousness produced by its use is better characterised as a [[delirium]] or [[Substance-induced psychosis]]<ref>{{cite journal|title=The Use of Hyoscyamine as a Hallucinogen and Intoxicant|first1=Martin H.|last1=Keeler|first2=Francis J.|last2=Kane|date=1 December 1967|journal=American Journal of Psychiatry|volume=124|issue=6|pages=852\u2013854|doi=10.1176/ajp.124.6.852|pmid = 6061275}}</ref> than as the more lucid and contemplative state evoked by true hallucinogens such as [[LSD]], [[psilocybin]], [[mescaline]] et al.

By contrast, the smoking of Atropa leaves (for purposes other than the relieving of asthma symptoms) does not seem to have been recorded outside the Ibero-Maghrebi area. What the [[transdermal]] absorption route involved in the use of 'flying ointments' and the pulmonary absorption route through smoking have in common is that both techniques allow users a modicum of control over the intoxication that would be more problematic in oral use (ingestion of Atropa is recorded mainly in cases of poisoning \u2013 by the fatally edible-looking berries \u2013 rather than in accounts of hallucinogenic use).\n\nThe smoking, as hallucinogens, of genera of tropane-containing Solanaceae other than Atropa \u2013 alone or as additives to Cannabis preparations \u2013 is not unknown elsewhere and is, in some instances, a practice of considerable antiquity.\nCharred seeds of Hyoscyamus niger have been found at certain prehistoric sites,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bhfieldschool.org/news/did-neolithic-europeans-use-drugs|title=Did Neolithic Europeans Use Drugs?|website=www.bhfieldschool.org}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ancient-wisdom.com/scotlandbalfarg.htm|title=Balfarg, Scotland.|first=Alex|last=Whitaker|website=www.ancient-wisdom.com}}</ref> leaves of ''[[Hyoscyamus muticus]]'' have been smoked by certain [[Bedouin]] tribes<ref>http://wilderness-ventures-egypt.com/2011/04/sakaran-\u0633\u0643\u0631\u0627\u0646/</ref><ref name= \"Ratsch Encyclopedia\">Ratsch, Christian, ''The Encyclopedia of Psychoactive Plants: Ethnopharmacology and Its Applications'' pub.

However, given a) the Iberian peninsula's history of Islamic cultural influence under Arab rule b) Islam's tolerance of the practice of cannabis-smoking and c) the greater antiquity of cannabis-smoking than the smoking of tobacco, it is possible that ''Atropa baetica'' was smoked with cannabis (as it still is in Morocco) in Spain prior to the introduction of tobacco from Hispaniola.\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n{{Taxonbar|from=Q5711166}}\n\n[[Category:Solanoideae]]\n", "name_user": "Rjwilmsi", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eMammalian consumers:Journal cites:, templated 1 journal cites", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atropa_baetica"}

Her memoir revolves around all of the pain, destruction, and lack of success her family faced as a result. She specifically tells her friend in her memoir not to move west because it is all a bunch of propaganda and she is not happy.

Green's memoir about her experiences in the [[Union Colony of Colorado]] is vastly different from any other previous writings on the west. Unlike the other writings and propaganda of the [[Pike's Peak Gold Rush]] and the [[California Gold Rush]], Green's memoir is a sarcastic lament by an easterner about the challenges U.S. Americans could face moving west. Her memoir revolves around all of the pain, destruction, and lack of success her family faced as a result. She specifically tells her friend in her memoir not to move west because it is all a bunch of propaganda and she is not happy. On top of being a corrective to popular propaganda about the West, her memoir is a unique look into the lives of American women and farmers in the U.S. West after the Civil War.\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Green, Annie Maria V.}}\n[[Category:19th-century American women writers]]\n", "name_user": "Ser Amantio di Nicolao", "label": "safe", "comment": "add authority control", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Annie_Maria_V._Green"}

Logan''''', also known as the '''General John A. Logan Monument''' and '''Logan Circle Monument''', is an [[equestrian statue]] in [[Washington, D.C.]] that honors politician and [[American Civil War|Civil War]] general [[John A. Logan]].  The monument is sited in the center of [[Logan Circle, Washington, D.C.|Logan Circle]], a traffic circle and public park in the Logan Circle neighborhood.  The statue was sculpted by artist [[Franklin Simmons]], whose other prominent works include the [[Peace Monument]] and statues in the [[National Statuary Hall Collection]].  The architect of the statue base was [[Richard Morris Hunt]], designer of prominent buildings including the [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]] in New York City and [[The Breakers]] in [[Newport, Rhode Island|Newport]], Rhode Island.  Prominent attendees at the dedication ceremony in 1901 included President [[William McKinley]], members of his cabinet, Senator [[Chauncey Depew]], Senator [[Shelby Moore Cullom]], and General [[Grenville M. Dodge]].\n\nThe sculpture is one of [[Civil War Monuments in Washington, D.C.|eighteen Civil War monuments]] in Washington, D.C., which were collectively listed on the [[National Register of Historic Places]] in 1978.  The bronze sculpture rests on a bronze and granite base adorned with two reliefs depicting historically inaccurate moments in Logan's life.  The monument and surrounding park are owned and maintained by the [[National Park Service]], a federal agency of the [[United States Department of the Interior|Interior Department]].\n\n==History==\n\n===Background===\n[[John A. Logan]] (1826\u20131886) was a native of [[Illinois]] who served as a second lieutenant in the [[Mexican\u2013American War]] before studying at the [[University of Louisville]] to become a lawyer.  Originally a member of the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]], he was elected state senator and later a member of the [[United States House of Representatives|U.S. House of Representatives]].  During the onset of the [[American Civil War|Civil War]], Logan denounced what he considered extremists on both sides, but eventually volunteered to fight with the [[Union Army]] during the [[First Battle of Bull Run]].  He then resigned from Congress and was made colonel after he organized the [[31st Illinois Volunteer Infantry Regiment]].  Logan was wounded twice while serving in the war and considered an outstanding field commander.  He was promoted to brigadier general following the victory at [[Battle of Fort Donelson|Fort Donelson]].  Logan played a significant role in the Union success at [[Siege of Vicksburg|Vicksburg]] and served as that district's military governor.  Following the death of General [[James B. McPherson]], Logan was given command of the [[Army of the Tennessee]], but was soon relieved by General [[Oliver O. Howard]] after Logan became too involved with the [[1864 United States presidential election|1864 presidential election]].

In the [[1884 United States presidential election|1884 presidential election]], Logan unsuccessfully ran with Senator [[James G. Blaine]] as his vice presidential candidate, narrowly losing the race.  During his time in office, Logan was considered one of the most vocal advocates for military veterans.  He helped organize two veteran fraternal organizations, the [[Grand Army of the Republic]] (GAR) and the Society of the Army of the Tennessee (SAT), and was instrumental in the federal government recognizing [[Memorial Day]] (originally called Decoration Day) as an official holiday, first celebrated in 1868.<ref name=jacob/><ref name=goode/>\n\nSoon after Logan's death in 1886, the SAT began work on erecting a monument to the military hero.

Members of the commission asked sculptor [[Augustus Saint-Gaudens]] who he would recommend.  He suggested [[Franklin Simmons]] (1839\u20131913), an American artist working in Rome.  Simmons had previously sculpted several Civil War monuments, including the [[Peace Monument]] in Washington, D.C.  His other works in the city include several statues in the [[National Statuary Hall Collection]] and the [[United States Senate Vice Presidential Bust Collection]].<ref name=jacob/>\n\nThe commission considered models by several sculptors before selecting Simmons in December 1892, whose model was the \"most agreeable to Mrs. Logan.\"  She admired not only the posture of Simmon's model, but his idea to have the statue rest on a bronze base, unlike other monuments in the city that featured granite bases.  Mary also liked that Simmons and members of the commission would follow her recommendations for the [[reliefs]] to be found on the statue base.  Simmons was paid $65,000 for his work; around $13,000 from the SAT and the remainder from the federal government.  Sculpting the piece proved more difficult than Simmons had expected since the Logan statue was his first and only equestrian work.  He was forced to ask for several extensions beginning in 1896.<ref name=jacob/>  Simmons paid [[Foundry|founder]] Fonderia Nelli extra money to work around the clock on the base, designed by prominent architect [[Richard Morris Hunt]], whose other works include the [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]] in New York City and [[The Breakers]] in [[Newport, Rhode Island|Newport]] Rhode Island.<ref name=smithsonian/><ref name=williams/>\n[[File:Northwest corner of Logan Circle.jpg|thumb|Row houses on the northwest corner of [[Logan Circle, Washington, D.C.|Logan Circle]]]]\nIt only took Nelli three-and-a-half months to complete the process instead of the planned year.  The Cranford Paving Company was contracted to prepare the site and lay the granite foundation.  Simmons was not pleased with the company's work and new stone was ordered in September 1897.  Following the new stone's placement, the base was installed on April 18, 1898.  It wasn't until 1900 that Simmons completed the sculpture and it was cast in Rome.<ref name=jacob/><ref name=smithsonian/>  Upon its completion, a ceremony attended by [[Umberto I of Italy|King Umberto I]] of Italy and his wife, [[Margherita of Savoy|Queen Margherita]], was held at the foundry where Simmons was honored with knighthood.<ref name=jacob/>  The sculpture was shipped to the United States and arrived in [[Brooklyn]] in December 1900.  Because the sculpture was too large to be transported by train, it was placed onto a two-masted [[schooner]] and arrived in Washington, D.C. on January 16, 1901.  It was installed on top of the base one week later.<ref name=smithsonian/>\n\nThe site chosen for the monument was the center of Iowa Circle, a park in an upscale neighborhood in the city's [[Northwest, Washington, D.C.|northwest]] [[Quadrants of Washington, D.C.|quadrant]].<ref name=williams>{{cite book | title=The Neighborhoods of Logan, Scott, and Thomas Circles | publisher=Arcadia Publishing | author=William, Paul K. | year=2001 | location=Charleston | pages=9 | isbn=9780738514048 }}</ref>  The park was completely redesigned in 1891 to make room for the monument.<ref name=survey/>  By the time it was dedicated in 1901, nearby [[Dupont Circle]] was lined with mansions and had become more popular with the city's wealthy residents while Iowa Circle, surrounded by stately row houses, had become a middle-class neighborhood.<ref name=williams/>\n\n===Dedication===\nThe monument was formally dedicated on April 9, 1901.<ref name=smithsonian/>  Temporary platforms for invited and distinguished guests were built near the base.  Guests included President [[William McKinley]], members of [[William McKinley#Administration and cabinet|his cabinet]], Senator [[Chauncey Depew]], Senator [[Shelby Moore Cullom]], General [[Grenville M. Dodge]], Mary Logan and several members of the Logan family, representatives from the GAR and SAT, and Simmons.  Prior to the ceremony, there was a large military parade led by Colonel Francis L. Guenther.  The parade consisted of soldiers, marines, seamen from the nearby [[Washington Navy Yard|Navy Yard]], the District of Columbia militia, and GAR and SAT veterans.  Dodge, who was president of the SAT and the only living general depicted on one of the relief panels, presided over the ceremonies.  George Tucker, a grandson of Logan, pulled a cord, parting the flags that had draped over the statue.  This was followed by cheers and applause from the crowd while the Fourth Artillery fired a national salute.<ref name=dedication>{{cite news | url=https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1901/04/10/118463786.pdf | title=John A.

Monuments which express the nation's gratitude for great deeds inspire great deeds.  The statue unveiled today proclaims our country's appreciation of one of her heroic sons whose name is dear to the American people, the ideal volunteer soldier of two wars, the eminent senator and commoner, General John A. Logan.\"  Following the president's speech, Depew also gave an address.  His remarks included: \"The history of our country is condensed in the Revolutionary and civil wars.  As Washington stands out in the first of our crucial contests, so does Lincoln in the second.  About Lincoln cluster Grant, Sherman, Sheridan, Logan, McPherson, and a host of other heroes...Among those successful Americans in many lines who have won and held the public eye and died mourned by all their countrymen, there will live in the future in the history of the Republic no nobler figure, in peace and in war, in the pursuits of the citizen, and in work for the welfare of his fellow citizens, than General John A. Logan.\"  Cullom then read a letter from Illinois governor [[Richard Yates Jr.]], who was unable to attend, which paid tribute to Logan and noted how proud the state's citizens were of the Illinois native.  The ceremony concluded following the benediction by Reverence J. G. Butler.<ref name=dedication/>\n\n===Reception===\n[[File:Logan Circle, NW, Washington, D.C LCCN2010641915.tif|thumb|The historically inaccurate relief panel depicting Logan being sworn into the Senate by Vice President [[Chester A.

They noted that the relief depicting Logan gathered with other Civil War leaders plotting strategy together was very unlikely.  The second panel, depicting Logan being sworn in as senator by Vice President [[Chester A. Arthur]] was called \"impossible\" and \"ridiculous.\"  Logan was sworn into the Senate in 1879 and Arthur himself was not sworn in as vice president until 1881.  Two of the senators depicted in that relief were not sworn in until 1882 and 1884, respectively, and another one died in 1877.  Mary Logan initially took credit for selecting the scenes depicted in the reliefs and received all of the blame when the errors were discovered.  In a heated letter to the ''[[The Washington Star|Evening Star]]'', she said the reliefs were not meant to be historically accurate: \"Of course, we knew all this, but we disregarded it because we wanted these panels to portray the most prominent men of the history of the country who were in the Senate during the 16 years that my husband was Senator.\"  She added to reproduce historically accurate scenes would have been \"absurd.\"<ref name=jacob/>\n\n===Later history===\nIn 1930, Congress renamed Iowa Circle in honor of Logan, who had briefly lived at 4 Logan Circle in 1885.<ref name=williams/>  The statue is one of [[Civil War Monuments in Washington, D.C.|eighteen Civil War monuments]] in Washington, D.C., that were collectively listed on the [[National Register of Historic Places]] (NRHP) on September 20, 1978, and the District of Columbia Inventory of Historic Sites on March 3, 1979.

McPherson]]'' statue.<ref name=jacob/>  Erection of the monument was approved by an act of Congress on March 2, 1889.<ref name=nomination>{{cite web | url={{NRHP url|id=78000257}} | title=National Register of Historic Places Inventory--Nomination Form - Civil War Monuments in Washington, D.C. | publisher=National Park Service | date=September 19, 1977 | accessdate=February 28, 2015 | author=Scott, Gary }}</ref>  A memorial commission was created to select a sculptor and site for the statue.  Members of the commission asked sculptor [[Augustus Saint-Gaudens]] who he would recommend.  He suggested [[Franklin Simmons]] (1839&ndash;1913), an American artist working in Rome.  Simmons had previously sculpted several Civil War monuments, including the [[Peace Monument]] in Washington, D.C.  His other works in the city include several statues in the [[National Statuary Hall Collection]] and the [[United States Senate Vice Presidential Bust Collection]].<ref name=jacob/>\n\nThe commission considered models by several sculptors before selecting Simmons in December 1892, whose model was the \"most agreeable to Mrs. Logan.\"  She admired not only the posture of Simmon's model, but his idea to have the statue rest on a bronze base, unlike other monuments in the city that featured granite bases.  Mary also liked that Simmons and members of the commission would follow her recommendations for the [[reliefs]] to be found on the statue base.  Simmons was paid $65,000 for his work; around $13,000 from the SAT and the remainder from the federal government.  Sculpting the piece proved more difficult than Simmons had expected since the Logan statue was his first and only equestrian work.  He was forced to ask for several extensions beginning in 1896.<ref name=jacob/>  Simmons paid [[Foundry|founder]] Fonderia Nelli extra money to work around the clock on the base, designed by prominent architect [[Richard Morris Hunt]], whose other works include the [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]] in New York City and [[The Breakers]] in [[Newport, Rhode Island|Newport]] Rhode Island.<ref name=smithsonian/><ref name=williams/>\n[[File:Northwest corner of Logan Circle.jpg|thumb|Row houses on the northwest corner of [[Logan Circle, Washington, D.C.|Logan Circle]]]]\nIt only took Nelli three-and-a-half months to complete the process instead of the planned year.  The Cranford Paving Company was contracted to prepare the site and lay the granite foundation.  Simmons was not pleased with the company's work and new stone was ordered in September 1897.  Following the new stone's placement, the base was installed on April 18, 1898.  It wasn't until 1900 that Simmons completed the sculpture and it was cast in Rome.<ref name=jacob/><ref name=smithsonian/>  Upon its completion, a ceremony attended by [[Umberto I of Italy|King Umberto I]] of Italy and his wife, [[Margherita of Savoy|Queen Margherita]], was held at the foundry where Simmons was honored with knighthood.<ref name=jacob/>  The sculpture was shipped to the United States and arrived in [[Brooklyn]] in December 1900.  Because the sculpture was too large to be transported by train, it was placed onto a two-masted [[schooner]] and arrived in Washington, D.C. on January 16, 1901.  It was installed on top of the base one week later.<ref name=smithsonian/>\n\nThe site chosen for the monument was the center of Iowa Circle, a park in an upscale neighborhood in the city's [[Northwest, Washington, D.C.|northwest]] [[Quadrants of Washington, D.C.|quadrant]].<ref name=williams>{{cite book | title=The Neighborhoods of Logan, Scott, and Thomas Circles | publisher=Arcadia Publishing | author=William, Paul K. | year=2001 | location=Charleston | pages=9 | isbn=9780738514048 }}</ref>  The park was completely redesigned in 1891 to make room for the monument.<ref name=survey/>  By the time it was dedicated in 1901, nearby [[Dupont Circle]] was lined with mansions and had become more popular with the city's wealthy residents while Iowa Circle, surrounded by stately row houses, had become a middle-class neighborhood.<ref name=williams/>\n\n===Dedication===\nThe monument was formally dedicated on April 9, 1901.<ref name=smithsonian/>  Temporary platforms for invited and distinguished guests were built near the base.  Guests included President [[William McKinley]], members of [[William McKinley#Administration and cabinet|his cabinet]], Senator [[Chauncey Depew]], Senator [[Shelby Moore Cullom]], General [[Grenville M. Dodge]], Mary Logan and several members of the Logan family, representatives from the GAR and SAT, and Simmons.  Prior to the ceremony, there was a large military parade led by Colonel Francis L. Guenther.  The parade consisted of soldiers, marines, seamen from the nearby [[Washington Navy Yard|Navy Yard]], the District of Columbia militia, and GAR and SAT veterans.  Dodge, who was president of the SAT and the only living general depicted on one of the relief panels, presided over the ceremonies.  George Tucker, a grandson of Logan, pulled a cord, parting the flags that had draped over the statue.  This was followed by cheers and applause from the crowd while the Fourth Artillery fired a national salute.<ref name=dedication>{{cite news | url=https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1901/04/10/118463786.pdf | title=John A.

Monuments which express the nation's gratitude for great deeds inspire great deeds.  The statue unveiled today proclaims our country's appreciation of one of her heroic sons whose name is dear to the American people, the ideal volunteer soldier of two wars, the eminent senator and commoner, General John A. Logan.\"  Following the president's speech, Depew also gave an address.  His remarks included: \"The history of our country is condensed in the Revolutionary and civil wars.  As Washington stands out in the first of our crucial contests, so does Lincoln in the second.  About Lincoln cluster Grant, Sherman, Sheridan, Logan, McPherson, and a host of other heroes...Among those successful Americans in many lines who have won and held the public eye and died mourned by all their countrymen, there will live in the future in the history of the Republic no nobler figure, in peace and in war, in the pursuits of the citizen, and in work for the welfare of his fellow citizens, than General John A. Logan.\"  Cullom then read a letter from Illinois governor [[Richard Yates Jr.]], who was unable to attend, which paid tribute to Logan and noted how proud the state's citizens were of the Illinois native.  The ceremony concluded following the benediction by Reverence J. G. Butler.<ref name=dedication/>\n\n===Reception===\n[[File:Logan monument - relief panel.jpg|thumb|The historically inaccurate relief panel depicting Logan being sworn into the Senate by Vice President [[Chester A. Arthur]].]]\nInitial reception to the statue was very positive.<ref name=jacob/>  ''[[The New York Times]]'' described it as producing \"an impression of dignity, beauty, and power.\"<ref name=dedication/>  But in the weeks following the dedication ceremony, praise turned to criticism and reporters noted \"absurdities\" in the relief panels.  They noted that the relief depicting Logan gathered with other Civil War leaders plotting strategy together was very unlikely.  The second panel, depicting Logan being sworn in as senator by Vice President [[Chester A. Arthur]] was called \"impossible\" and \"ridiculous.\"  Logan was sworn into the Senate in 1879 and Arthur himself was not sworn in as vice president until 1881.  Two of the senators depicted in that relief were not sworn in until 1882 and 1884, respectively, and another one died in 1877.  Mary Logan initially took credit for selecting the scenes depicted in the reliefs and received all of the blame when the errors were discovered.  In a heated letter to the ''[[The Washington Star|Evening Star]]'', she said the reliefs were not meant to be historically accurate: \"Of course, we knew all this, but we disregarded it because we wanted these panels to portray the most prominent men of the history of the country who were in the Senate during the 16 years that my husband was Senator.\"  She added to reproduce historically accurate scenes would have been \"absurd.\"<ref name=jacob/>\n\n===Later history===\nIn 1930, Congress renamed Iowa Circle in honor of Logan, who had briefly lived at 4 Logan Circle in 1885.<ref name=williams/>  The statue is one of [[Civil War Monuments in Washington, D.C.|eighteen Civil War monuments]] in Washington, D.C., that were collectively listed on the [[National Register of Historic Places]] (NRHP) on September 20, 1978, and the District of Columbia Inventory of Historic Sites on March 3, 1979.

Little was built during the first four centuries of [[Moorish]] control (see [[Reconquista]]).\n*'''1160''' \u2013 The [[Almohad]] Sultan [[Abd al-Mu'min]] ordered that a permanent settlement, including a [[castle]], be built. It received the name of ''Medinat al-Fath'' (City of the Victory). On completion of the works in the town, the Sultan crossed the Strait to inspect the works and stayed in Gibraltar for two months. The Tower of Homage of the castle remains standing today ([[Moorish Castle]]).\n*'''1231''' \u2013 After the collapse of the Almohad Empire, Gibraltar was taken by [[Ibn Hud]], [[Taifa]] emir of Murcia.\n*'''1237''' \u2013 Following the death of [[Ibn Hud]], his domains were handed over to [[Muhammad I of Granada|Muhammad ibn al-Ahmar]], the founder of the [[Nasrid dynasty|Nasrid]] [[kingdom of Granada]]. Therefore, Gibraltar changed hands again.\n*'''1274''' \u2013 The second Nasrid king, [[Muhammed II al-Faqih]], gave Gibraltar over to the [[Marinid]]s, as payment for their help against the Christian kingdoms.\n*'''1309''' \u2013 While the King [[Ferdinand IV of Castile]] laid [[Siege of Algeciras (1309)|siege on Algeciras]], [[Alonso P\u00e9rez de Guzm\u00e1n]] (known to the Spanish records as ''Guzm\u00e1n el Bueno'') was sent to capture the town. This was the First Siege of Gibraltar. The Castilians took the Upper Rock from where the town was bombarded. The garrison surrendered after one month. Gibraltar then had about 1,500 inhabitants.\n*'''1310''' 31 January \u2013 Gibraltar was granted its first Charter by the king Ferdinand IV of Castile. Being considered a high risk town, the charter included incentives to settle there such as the offering of freedom from justice to anyone who lived in Gibraltar for one year and one day.\n:This fact marked the establishment of the Gibraltar council.\n*'''1316''' \u2013 Gibraltar was unsuccessfully besieged by the Nasrid [[qaid|caid]] Yahya (Second Siege of Gibraltar).\n*'''1333''' June \u2013 A [[Marinid]] army, led by [[Abd al-Malik Abd al-Wahid|Abd al-Malik]], the son of [[Abu Al-Hasan Ali ibn Othman|Abul Hassan]], the Marinid sultan, recovered Gibraltar, after a five-month siege (Third Siege of Gibraltar).\n:King [[Alfonso XI of Castile]] attempted to retake Gibraltar aided by the fleet of the Castilian Admiral [[Alonso Jofre Tenorio]]. Even a ditch was dug across the isthmus. While laying the siege, the king was attacked by a Nasrid army from Granada. Therefore, the siege ended in a truce, allowing the Marinids to keep Gibraltar (Fourth Siege of Gibraltar).\n*'''1344''' March \u2013 After the two-year [[Siege of Algeciras (1342-1344)]], [[Algeciras]] was taken over by the Castilian forces. Therefore, Gibraltar became the main Marinid port in the Iberian Peninsula. During the siege, Gibraltar played a key role as the supply base of the besieged.\n*'''1349''' \u2013 Gibraltar was unsuccessfully besieged by the Castilian forces led by the king [[Alfonso XI of Castile|Alfonso XI]].\n*'''1350''' \u2013 The siege was resumed by Alfonso XI.

Ten years later the city was razed out to the ground, and its harbour made unusable. This fact increased again the importance of Gibraltar, yet in Marinid hands, in the strait trade.

Finally, the initiative of Juan Alonso de Guzm\u00e1n, 1st [[Duke of Medina Sidonia]], succeeded and he took possession of the town as personal property. However, the King of Castile, [[Henry IV of Castile|Henry IV]], declared Gibraltar to be Crown property and not the personal property of the Guzman family. Henry IV restored the charter granted to Gibraltar in 1310 and took two additional measures: the lands previously belonging to [[Algeciras]] (destroyed in 1369) were granted to Gibraltar; and the status of [[collegiate church]] was solicited from the pope [[Pius II]] and granted to the parish church of Saint Mary the Crowned ({{lang-es|link=no|iglesia parroquial de Santa Mar\u00eda la Coronada}}), now the [[Cathedral of St. Mary the Crowned]], on the site of the old main Moorish Mosque.

The [[Treaty of Paris (1783)|Treaties of Versailles]] which ceded [[Menorca]] and Florida to Spain, reaffirmed previous treaties in the rest of issues, thus not affecting to Gibraltar.\n:In 1782, work on the [[Great Siege Tunnels]] started. The tunnels became a great and complex system of underground fortifications which nowadays criss-crosses the inside of the Rock. Once the Siege was over, the fortifications were rebuilt and, in the following century, the walls were lined with [[Portland limestone]]. Such stone gave the walls their present white appearance.\n:The successful resistance in the Great Siege is attributed to several factors: the improvement in fortifications by Colonel (later General Sir) [[William Green (general)|William Green]] in 1769; the British naval supremacy, which translated into support of the Navy; the competent command by General [[George Augustus Eliott, 1st Baron Heathfield|George Augustus Elliot]]; and an appropriately sized garrison.<ref>''Gibraltar: British or Spanish?'', pg. 8.</ref> As in the early years of the British period, during the Siege the British Government considered to exchange Gibraltar for some Spanish possession.

A History of Gibraltar'', p. 368.</ref> there are no primary sources that could explain whether such a demolition was requested or authorized by any Spanish or British authority. According to him, over time, three different theories have emerged: (a) Campbell ordered the demolition on his own authority (b) under instructions from the British Government (c) upon request of Spanish [[Francisco Javier Casta\u00f1os, 1st Duke of Bail\u00e9n|General Casta\u00f1os]], who was at the time in C\u00e1diz.

Control of Gibraltar gave the [[Allies of World War II|Allied Powers]] control of the entry to the [[Mediterranean Sea]] (the other side of the Strait being Spanish territory, and thus [[non-belligerent]]). The Rock was a key part of the Allied supply lines to [[Malta]] and North Africa and base of the British Navy [[Force H]], and prior to the war the [[racecourse]] on the isthmus was converted into an [[airbase]] and a concrete runway constructed (1938).

The Tower of Homage of the castle remains standing today ([[Moorish Castle]]).\n*'''1231''' \u2013 After the collapse of the Almohad Empire, Gibraltar was taken by [[Ibn Hud]], [[Taifa]] emir of Murcia.\n*'''1237''' \u2013 Following the death of [[Ibn Hud]], his domains were handed over to [[Muhammad I of Granada|Muhammad ibn al-Ahmar]], the founder of the [[Nasrid dynasty|Nasrid]] [[kingdom of Granada]]. Therefore, Gibraltar changed hands again.\n*'''1274''' \u2013 The second Nasrid king, [[Muhammed II al-Faqih]], gave Gibraltar over to the [[Marinid]]s, as payment for their help against the Christian kingdoms.\n*'''1309''' \u2013 While the King [[Ferdinand IV of Castile]] laid [[Siege of Algeciras (1309)|siege on Algeciras]], [[Alonso P\u00e9rez de Guzm\u00e1n]] (known to the Spanish records as ''Guzm\u00e1n el Bueno'') was sent to capture the town. This was the First Siege of Gibraltar. The Castilians took the Upper Rock from where the town was bombarded. The garrison surrendered after one month. Gibraltar then had about 1,500 inhabitants.\n*'''1310''' 31 January \u2013 Gibraltar was granted its first Charter by the king Ferdinand IV of Castile. Being considered a high risk town, the charter included incentives to settle there such as the offering of freedom from justice to anyone who lived in Gibraltar for one year and one day.\n:This fact marked the establishment of the Gibraltar council.\n*'''1316''' \u2013 Gibraltar was unsuccessfully besieged by the Nasrid [[qaid|caid]] Yahya (Second Siege of Gibraltar).\n*'''1333''' June \u2013 A [[Marinid]] army, led by [[Abd al-Malik Abd al-Wahid|Abd al-Malik]], the son of [[Abu Al-Hasan Ali ibn Othman|Abul Hassan]], the Marinid sultan, recovered Gibraltar, after a five-month siege (Third Siege of Gibraltar).\n:King [[Alfonso XI of Castile]] attempted to retake Gibraltar aided by the fleet of the Castilian Admiral [[Alonso Jofre Tenorio]]. Even a ditch was dug across the isthmus. While laying the siege, the king was attacked by a Nasrid army from Granada. Therefore, the siege ended in a truce, allowing the Marinids to keep Gibraltar (Fourth Siege of Gibraltar).\n*'''1344''' March \u2013 After the two-year [[Siege of Algeciras (1342-1344)]], [[Algeciras]] was taken over by the Castilian forces. Therefore, Gibraltar became the main Marinid port in the Iberian Peninsula. During the siege, Gibraltar played a key role as the supply base of the besieged.\n*'''1349''' \u2013 Gibraltar was unsuccessfully besieged by the Castilian forces led by the king [[Alfonso XI of Castile|Alfonso XI]].\n*'''1350''' \u2013 The siege was resumed by Alfonso XI. It was again unsuccessful, mainly due to the arrival of the [[Black Death]], which decimated the besiegers, causing the death of the king (Fifth Siege of Gibraltar).\n*'''1369''' \u2013 As the [[Castilian Civil War|Civil War in Castile]] came to an end, with the murder of king [[Peter I of Castile|Peter I]] by the pretender Henry (to be known as [[Henry II of Castile|Henry II]]), the [[Nasrid dynasty|Nasrid]] king of [[kingdom of Granada|Granada]], [[Muhammad V of Granada|Muhammad V]], former ally of Peter, took over Algeciras after the 3-day [[Siege of Algeciras (1369)]]. Ten years later the city was razed out to the ground, and its harbour made unusable. This fact increased again the importance of Gibraltar, yet in Marinid hands, in the strait trade. A subsequent truce was signed between Muhammad and Henry, preventing the Christian kings from attempting to recover the city.\n*'''1374''' \u2013 Following a period of internal instability in the Marinid [[Sultanate of Fez]], [[Abu al-Abbas Ahmad of Fez]], ask for [[Muhammad V of Granada]] help. Possibly as a condition of the alliance or as reward for Muhammad's successful expedition to Africa, Gibraltar was handed over to the [[Nasrid dynasty|Nasrids]] of Granada.\n*'''1410''' \u2013 The garrison in Gibraltar mutinied against the king of Granada and declared for the [[kingdom of Fez|king of Fez]], [[Fayd of Fez|Fayd]]. Fayd sent his brother Abu Said over to Gibraltar to take possession of the city. He also took over other Nasrid ports such as [[Marbella]] and [[Estepona]].\n*'''1411''' \u2013 The son of Yusuf III of Granada, Ahmad, recovered Marbella and Estepona. Next, it laid siege to Gibraltar (Sixth Siege of Gibraltar) and recovered the city for the kingdom of Granada.\n*'''1436''' \u2013 [[Enrique de Guzm\u00e1n]], second Count of Niebla, with large estates in Southern [[Andalusia]], assaulted Gibraltar. However, his attack was repelled and Castilian forces suffer heavy losses (Seventh Siege of Gibraltar).\n\n==Castilian/Spanish rule==\n*'''1462''' 20 August \u2013 Castilian forces captured Gibraltar (Eighth Siege of Gibraltar). (See [[Reconquista]]). An immediate dispute broke out between the [[House of Medina Sidonia]] (the Guzm\u00e1n family) and the [[House of Arcos]] (the Ponce de Le\u00f3n family) about the possession of the town. Finally, the initiative of Juan Alonso de Guzm\u00e1n, 1st [[Duke of Medina Sidonia]], succeeded and he took possession of the town as personal property. However, the King of Castile, [[Henry IV of Castile|Henry IV]], declared Gibraltar to be Crown property and not the personal property of the Guzman family. Henry IV restored the charter granted to Gibraltar in 1310 and took two additional measures: the lands previously belonging to [[Algeciras]] (destroyed in 1369) were granted to Gibraltar; and the status of [[collegiate church]] was solicited from the pope [[Pius II]] and granted to the parish church of Saint Mary the Crowned ({{lang-es|link=no|iglesia parroquial de Santa Mar\u00eda la Coronada}}), now the [[Cathedral of St. Mary the Crowned]], on the site of the old main Moorish Mosque.

The [[Treaty of Paris (1783)|Treaties of Versailles]] which ceded [[Menorca]] and Florida to Spain, reaffirmed previous treaties in the rest of issues, thus not affecting to Gibraltar.\n:In 1782, work on the [[Great Siege Tunnels]] started. The tunnels became a great and complex system of underground fortifications which nowadays criss-crosses the inside of the Rock. Once the Siege was over, the fortifications were rebuilt and, in the following century, the walls were lined with [[Portland limestone]]. Such stone gave the walls their present white appearance.\n:The successful resistance in the Great Siege is attributed to several factors: the improvement in fortifications by Colonel (later General Sir) [[William Green (general)|William Green]] in 1769; the British naval supremacy, which translated into support of the Navy; the competent command by General [[George Augustus Eliott, 1st Baron Heathfield|George Augustus Elliot]]; and an appropriately sized garrison.<ref>''Gibraltar: British or Spanish?'', pg. 8.</ref> As in the early years of the British period, during the Siege the British Government considered to exchange Gibraltar for some Spanish possession.

A History of Gibraltar'', p. 368.</ref> there are no primary sources that could explain whether such a demolition was requested or authorized by any Spanish or British authority. According to him, over time, three different theories have emerged: (a) Campbell ordered the demolition on his own authority (b) under instructions from the British Government (c) upon request of Spanish [[Francisco Javier Casta\u00f1os, 1st Duke of Bail\u00e9n|General Casta\u00f1os]], who was at the time in C\u00e1diz.

However, after the [[Second Armistice at Compi\u00e8gne|French-German Armistice]] and the subsequent [[Destruction of the French Fleet at Mers-el-Kebir|destruction of the French fleet at Mers-el-Kebir, Algeria]] by the British Navy in July 1940, the French-Moroccan authorities asked all Gibraltarian evacuees to be removed. 12,000 went to Britain, while about 3,000 went to [[Madeira]] or [[Jamaica]], with the rest moving to Spain or [[Tanger]]. Control of Gibraltar gave the [[Allies of World War II|Allied Powers]] control of the entry to the [[Mediterranean Sea]] (the other side of the Strait being Spanish territory, and thus [[non-belligerent]]). The Rock was a key part of the Allied supply lines to [[Malta]] and North Africa and base of the British Navy [[Force H]], and prior to the war the [[racecourse]] on the isthmus was converted into an [[airbase]] and a concrete runway constructed (1938). The repatriation of the civilians started in 1944 and proceeded until 1951, causing considerable suffering and frustration. However, most of the population had returned by 1946.\n\n*'''1940''' 4 July \u2013 French bombers, based in French Morocco, carried out a retaliatory air raid over Gibraltar as a reprisal for the [[Destruction of the French Fleet at Mers-el-Kebir|destruction of the French fleet at Mers-el-Kebir, Algeria]], by the Force H (about 1,300 French sailors were killed and about 350 were wounded in the action against the French fleet).\n*'''1941''' \u2013 Germany planned to occupy Gibraltar (and presumably hand it over to Spain{{Citation needed|date=December 2009}}) in \"Operation Felix\" which was due to start on 10 January 1941.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.adolfhitler.ws/lib/proc/direct18.html |title=Operation Felix.

Historical linguistics was among the first sub-disciplines to emerge in linguistics, and was the most widely practised form of linguistics in the late 19th century.{{cn|date=February 2020}} There was a shift of focus in the early twentieth century to the synchronic approach (the systemic study of the current stage in languages), but historical research remained a field of linguistic inquiry. Subfields include [[language change]] and [[grammaticalisation]] studies.\n\nWestern modern historical [[linguistics]] dates from the late 18th century.  It grew out of the earlier discipline of [[philology]],<ref>{{Cite book|title=Historical Linguistics: An Introduction|last=Campbell|first=Lyle|publisher=Edinburgh University Press|year=1998|isbn=978-0-7486-4601-2|location=Edinburgh|pages=391}}</ref> the study of ancient texts and documents dating back to [[wikt:antiquity|antiquity]].\n\nAt first, historical linguistics served as the cornerstone of [[comparative linguistics]] primarily as a tool for linguistic reconstruction.<ref name=\"Routledge introduction\">\"Editors' Introduction: Foundations of the new historical linguistics.\" In. ''The Routledge Handbook of Historical Linguistics'' Routledge p.&nbsp;25.</ref>  Scholars were concerned chiefly with establishing language families and reconstructing prehistoric proto-languages, using the [[comparative method]] and [[internal reconstruction]].<ref name=\"Routledge introduction\" /> The focus was initially on the well-known [[Indo-European languages]], many of which had long written histories; the scholars also studied the [[Uralic languages]], another European language family for which less early written material exists. Since then, there has been significant comparative linguistic work expanding outside of European languages as well, such as on the [[Austronesian languages]] and various families of [[Native American languages]], among many others. Comparative linguistics is now, however, only a part of a more broadly conceived discipline of historical linguistics. For the Indo-European languages, comparative study is now a highly specialized field.  Most research is being carried out on the subsequent development of these languages, in particular, the development of the modern standard varieties.\n\nSome scholars have undertaken studies attempting to establish super-families, linking, for example, Indo-European, Uralic, and other families into [[Nostratic]].  These attempts have not been accepted widely.  The information necessary to establish relatedness becomes less available as the time depth is increased. The time-depth of linguistic methods is limited due to chance word resemblances and variations between language groups, but a limit of around 10,000 years is often assumed.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Baldi|first=Philip|author-link=Philip Baldi|year=2012|title=Historical Linguistics and Cognitive Science|url=http://www.personal.psu.edu/ped10/Giuli_Dussias/Publications/External/Baldi_Dussias_Rhesis_2012_GD_09_13_2012.pdf|journal=Rheis, International Journal of Linguistics, Philology and Literature|volume=3|issue=1|pages=5\u201327}} p.&nbsp;11.</ref> The dating of the various proto-languages is also difficult; several methods are available for dating, but only approximate results can be obtained.\n\n=== Syntax and morphology===\n{{main|Syntax|Morphology (linguistics)}}\nSyntax and morphology are branches of linguistics concerned with the order and structure of meaningful linguistic units such as words and [[morphemes]]. Syntacticians study the rules and constraints that govern how speakers of a language can organize words into sentences. Morphologists study similar rules for the order of morphemes\u2014sub-word units such as prefixes and suffixes\u2014and how they may be combined to form words.\n\nWhile words, along with [[clitic]]s, are generally accepted as being the smallest units of [[syntax]], in most languages, if not all, many words can be related to other words by rules that collectively describe the [[grammar]] for that language. For example, [[English language|English]] speakers recognize that the words ''dog'' and ''dogs'' are closely related, differentiated only by the [[plural]]ity [[morpheme]] \"-s\", only found [[Bound morpheme|bound]] to [[noun phrase]]s. Speakers of English, a [[fusional language]], recognize these relations from their innate knowledge of English's rules of [[word formation]]. They infer intuitively that ''dog'' is to ''dogs'' as ''cat'' is to ''cats''; and, in similar fashion, ''dog'' is to ''dog catcher'' as ''dish'' is to ''dishwasher''. By contrast, [[Classical Chinese]] has very little morphology, using almost exclusively unbound morphemes (\"free\" morphemes) and depending on [[word order]] to convey meaning. (Most words in modern [[Standard Chinese]] [\"Mandarin\"], however, are [[Compound (linguistics)|compounds]] and most [[Root (linguistics)|roots]] are bound.) These are understood as grammars that represent the morphology of the language. The rules understood by a speaker reflect specific patterns or regularities in the way words are formed from smaller units in the language they are using, and how those smaller units interact in speech. In this way, morphology is the branch of linguistics that studies patterns of word formation within and across languages and attempts to formulate rules that model the knowledge of the speakers of those languages.\n\n[[Phonological]] and [[orthography|orthographic]] modifications between a base word and its origin may be partial to [[literacy]] skills. Studies have indicated that the presence of modification in phonology and orthography makes morphologically complex words harder to understand and that the absence of modification between a base word and its origin makes morphologically complex words easier to understand. Morphologically complex words are easier to comprehend when they include a base word.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Wilson-Fowler, E.B.|first=& Apel, K.|date=2015|title=Influence of Morphological Awareness on College Students' Literacy Skills: A path Analytic Approach|url=|journal=Journal of Literacy Research|volume=47 |issue=3|pages=405\u201332|doi=10.1177/1086296x15619730}}</ref>\n\n[[Polysynthetic language]]s, such as [[Chukchi language|Chukchi]], have words composed of many morphemes. The Chukchi word \"t\u0259mey\u014b\u0259levtp\u0259\u03b3t\u0259rk\u0259n\", for example, meaning \"I have a fierce headache\", is composed of eight morphemes ''t-\u0259-mey\u014b-\u0259-levt-p\u0259\u03b3t-\u0259-rk\u0259n'' that may be [[Gloss (annotation)|glossed]]. The morphology of such languages allows for each [[consonant]] and [[vowel]] to be understood as [[morphemes]], while the grammar of the language indicates the usage and understanding of each morpheme.\n\nThe discipline that deals specifically with the sound changes occurring within morphemes is [[morphophonology]].\n\n=== Semantics and pragmatics ===\n{{main|Semantics|Pragmatics}}\nSemantics and pragmatics are branches of linguistics concerned with meaning. These subfields have traditionally been divided by the role of linguistic and social context in the determination of meaning. Semantics in this conception is concerned with core meanings and pragmatics concerned with meaning in context. Pragmatics encompasses [[speech act]] theory, conversational [[implicature]], [[Conversation analysis|talk in interaction]] and other approaches to language behavior in [[Philosophy of language|philosophy]], [[Sociology of language|sociology]], linguistics and [[anthropology]].<ref name=Mey>Mey, Jacob L. (1993) ''Pragmatics: An Introduction''.

Phonetics is largely concerned with the physical aspects of sounds such as their acoustics, production, and perception. Phonology is concerned with the linguistic abstractions and categorizations of sounds.\n\n== Language varieties ==\n{{see|Variety (linguistics)}}\nLanguages exist on a wide continuum of conventionalization with blurry divisions between concepts such as dialects and languages. Languages can undergo internal changes which lead to the development of subvarieties such as [[linguistic register]]s, accents, and dialects. Similarly, languages can undergo changes caused by contact with speakers of other languages, and new language varieties may be born from these contact situations through the process of [[language genesis]].\n\n=== Contact varieties ===\n{{see|Creolistics}}\nContact varieties such as pidgins and creoles are language varieties that often arise in situations of sustained contact between communities that speak different languages. [[Pidgin]]s are language varieties with limited conventionalization where ideas are conveyed through simplified grammars that may grow more complex as linguistic contact continues. [[Creole language]]s are language varieties similar to pidgins but with greater conventionalization and stability. As children grow up in contact situations, they may learn a local pidgin as their native language. Through this process of acquisition and transmission, new grammatical features and lexical items are created and introduced to fill [[lexical gap|gaps]] in the pidgin eventually developing into a complete language.\n\nNot all language contact situations result in the development of a pidgin or creole, and researchers have studied the features of contact situations that make contact varieties more likely to develop. Often these varieties arise in situations of [[colonization]] and [[slavery|enslavement]], where power imbalances prevent the contact groups from learning the other's language but sustained contact is nevertheless maintained. The subjugated language in the power relationship is the [[substrate language]], while the dominant language serves as the [[superstrate]]. Often the words and lexicon of a contact variety come from the superstrate, making it the [[lexifier]], while grammatical structures come from the substrate, but this is not always the case.<ref>{{cite book|last=Selbach|first=Rachel|year=2008|chapter=The superstrate is not always the lexi\ufb01er: Lingua Franca in the Barbary Coast 1530\u20141830|title=Roots of creole structures: Weighing the contribution of substrates and superstrates|volume=33|series=Creole Language Library|editor-last=Michaelis|editor-first=Susanne}}</ref>\n\n=== Dialect ===\nA dialect is a [[variety (linguistics)|variety]] of [[language]] that is characteristic of a particular group among the language's speakers.<ref>[http://dictionary.oed.com/cgi/entry/50063104?query_type=word&queryword=dialect&first=1&max_to_show=10&sort_type=alpha&result_place=1&search_id=tFGd-Bh8USU-18775&hilite=50063104 Oxford English dictionary.]</ref> The group of people who are the speakers of a dialect are usually bound to each other by social identity. This is what differentiates a dialect from a [[register (sociolinguistics)|register]] or a [[discourse]], where in the latter case, cultural identity does not always play a role. Dialects are speech varieties that have their own grammatical and phonological rules, linguistic features, and stylistic aspects, but have not been given an official status as a language. Dialects often move on to gain the status of a language due to political and social reasons. Other times, dialects remain marginalized, particularly when they are associated with marginalized social groups.<ref>{{Cite book|title=English with an accent: Language, ideology and discrimination in the United States|last=Lippi-Green|first=Rosina|publisher=Routledge|year=2012|isbn=|location=|pages=}}</ref>{{page needed|date=September 2019}} Differentiation amongst dialects (and subsequently, languages) is based upon the use of grammatical rules, syntactic rules, and stylistic features, though not always on lexical use or vocabulary. The popular saying that \"[[a language is a dialect with an army and navy]]\" is attributed as a definition formulated by [[Max Weinreich]].\n\n<blockquote>\"We may as individuals be rather fond of our own dialect. This should not make us think, though, that it is actually any better than any other dialect. Dialects are not good or bad, nice or nasty, right or wrong&nbsp;\u2013 they are just different from one another, and it is the mark of a civilised society that it tolerates different dialects just as it tolerates different races, religions and sexes.\"<ref>Trudgill, P. (1994). Dialects. ''Ebooks Online'' Routledge. Florence, KY.</ref></blockquote>\n\n===Standard language===\n{{Unreferenced section|date=December 2018}}\nWhen a dialect is documented sufficiently through the linguistic description of its grammar, which has emerged through the consensual laws from within its community, it gains political and national recognition through a country or region's policies. That is the stage when a language is considered a [[standard variety]], one whose grammatical laws have now stabilised from within the consent of [[speech community]] participants, after sufficient evolution, improvisation, correction, and growth. The English language, besides perhaps the French language, may be examples of languages that have arrived at a stage where they are said to have become standard varieties.\n\n===Relativity===\nAs constructed popularly through the [[linguistic relativity|Sapir\u2013Whorf hypothesis]], relativists believe that the structure of a particular language is capable of influencing the cognitive patterns through which a person shapes his or her [[world view]]. Universalists believe that there are commonalities between human perception as there is in the human capacity for language, while relativists believe that this varies from language to language and person to person. While the Sapir\u2013Whorf hypothesis is an elaboration of this idea expressed through the writings of American linguists [[Edward Sapir]] and [[Benjamin Lee Whorf]], it was Sapir's student [[Harry Hoijer]] who termed it thus. The 20th century German linguist [[Leo Weisgerber]] also wrote extensively about the theory of relativity. Relativists argue for the case of differentiation at the level of cognition and in semantic domains. The emergence of [[cognitive linguistics]] in the 1980s also revived an interest in linguistic relativity. Thinkers like [[George Lakoff]] have argued that language reflects different cultural metaphors, while the French philosopher of language [[Jacques Derrida]]'s writings, especially about[[deconstructivism|deconstruction]],<ref>{{cite book|author=Jacques Derrida|url=https://archive.org/details/writingdifferenc00derr_0|title=Writing and Difference|publisher=University of Chicago Press|year=1978|isbn=978-0-226-14329-3|translator=Alan Bass|url-access=registration}}</ref> have been seen to be closely associated with the relativist movement in linguistics, for which he was heavily criticized in the media at the time of his death.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/2004/nov/18/philosophy |title=Relative Thinking |work=The Guardian |first=Richard |last=Lea |date=18 November 2004}}</ref>\n\n==Structures==\n{{Unreferenced section|date=January 2019}}\nLinguistic structures are pairings of meaning and form.  Any particular pairing of meaning and form is a [[Ferdinand de Saussure|Saussurean]] [[linguistic sign|sign]].  For instance, the meaning \"cat\" is represented worldwide with a wide variety of different sound patterns (in oral languages), movements of the hands and face (in [[sign language]]s), and written symbols (in written languages). Linguistic patterns have proven their importance for the [[knowledge engineering]] field especially with the ever-increasing amount of available data.\n\nLinguists focusing on structure attempt to understand the rules regarding language use that native speakers know (not always consciously).  All linguistic structures can be broken down into component parts that are combined according to (sub)conscious rules, over multiple levels of analysis.  For instance, consider the structure of the word \"tenth\" on two different levels of analysis.  On the level of internal word structure (known as morphology), the word \"tenth\" is made up of one linguistic form indicating a number and another form indicating ordinality.  The rule governing the combination of these forms ensures that the ordinality marker \"th\" follows the number \"ten.\"  On the level of sound structure (known as phonology), structural analysis shows that the \"n\" sound in \"tenth\" is made differently from the \"n\" sound in \"ten\" spoken alone.  Although most speakers of English are consciously aware of the rules governing internal structure of the word pieces of \"tenth\", they are less often aware of the rule governing its sound structure.  Linguists focused on structure find and analyze rules such as these, which govern how native speakers use language.\n\n===Grammar===\n\n[[Grammar]] is a system of rules which governs the production and use of [[utterances]] in a given language. These rules apply to sound<ref>All references in this article to the study of sound should be taken to include the manual and non-manual signs used in [[sign language]]s.</ref> as well as meaning, and include componential subsets of rules, such as those pertaining to [[phonology]] (the organisation of phonetic sound systems), [[morphology (linguistics)|morphology]] (the formation and composition of words), and [[syntax]] (the formation and composition of phrases and sentences).<ref>{{cite book |title=Linguistics |year=2010 |publisher=The MIT Press |isbn=978-0-262-51370-8 |url=https://mitpress.mit.edu/catalog/item/examrequest.asp?ttype=2&tid=12240 |archive-url=https://archive.today/20121214215844/http://mitpress.mit.edu/catalog/item/examrequest.asp?ttype=2&tid=12240 |url-status=dead |archive-date=14 December 2012 |edition=6th |author1=Adrian Akmajian |author2=Richard A.

As a social practice, discourse embodies different ideologies through written and spoken texts. Discourse analysis can examine or expose these ideologies.   Discourse influences genre, which is chosen in response to different situations and finally, at micro level, discourse influences language as text (spoken or written) at the phonological or lexico-grammatical level. Grammar and discourse are linked as parts of a system.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Ariel|first=Mira|year=2009|title=Discourse, grammar, discourse|jstor=24049745|journal=Discourse Studies|volume=11|issue=1|pages=5\u201336|doi=10.1177/1461445608098496}}</ref>  A particular discourse becomes a language variety when it is used in this way for a particular purpose, and is referred to as a [[register (sociolinguistics)|register]].<ref>Helen Leckie-Tarry, ''Language and Context: a Functional Linguistic Theory of Register'', Continuum International Publishing Group, 1995, p.&nbsp;6. {{ISBN|1-85567-272-3}}</ref> There may be certain [[lexicon|lexical]] additions (new words) that are brought into play because of the expertise of the community of people within a certain domain of specialization. Registers and discourses therefore differentiate themselves through the use of [[vocabulary]], and at times through the use of style too. People in the medical fraternity, for example, may use some medical terminology in their communication that is specialized to the field of medicine. This is often referred to as being part of the \"medical discourse\", and so on.\n\n===Lexicon===\nThe [[lexicon]] is a catalogue of words and terms that are stored in a speaker's mind. The lexicon consists of [[words]] and [[bound morphemes]], which are parts of words that can't stand alone, like [[affixes]]. In some analyses, compound words and certain classes of idiomatic expressions and other collocations are also considered to be part of the lexicon. Dictionaries represent attempts at listing, in alphabetical order, the lexicon of a given language; usually, however, bound morphemes are not included. [[Lexicography]], closely linked with the domain of semantics, is the science of mapping the words into an [[encyclopedia]] or a [[dictionary]]. The creation and addition of new words (into the lexicon) is called coining or neologization,<ref>{{Cite book |authorlink=Ghil'ad Zuckermann |last=Zuckermann |first=Ghil'ad |year=2003 |url=http://www.palgrave.com/gb/book/9781403917232 |title=Language Contact and Lexical Enrichment in Israeli Hebrew |publisher=Palgrave Macmillan |isbn=978-1-4039-1723-2 |pages=2ff}}</ref> and the new words are called [[neologism]]s.\n\nIt is often believed that a speaker's capacity for language lies in the quantity of words stored in the lexicon. However, this is often considered a myth by linguists. The capacity for the use of language is considered by many linguists to lie primarily in the domain of grammar, and to be linked with [[linguistic competence|competence]], rather than with the growth of vocabulary. Even a very small lexicon is theoretically capable of producing an infinite number of sentences.\n\n===Style===\n[[stylistics (field of study)|Stylistics]] also involves the study of written, signed, or spoken [[discourse]] through varying speech communities, [[genres]], and editorial or [[narrative]] formats in the mass media.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.uni-giessen.de/anglistik/ling/Staff/mukherjee/pdfs/Stylistics.pdf |title=\"Stylistics\" by Joybrato Mukherjee.

Stylistic analysis entails the analysis of description of particular [[dialects]] and [[register (sociolinguistics)|registers]] used by speech communities. Stylistic features include [[rhetoric]],<ref>{{cite book|title=The Philosophy of Rhetoric |author=IA Richards |year=1965 |publisher=Oxford University Press (New York)}}</ref> diction, stress, [[satire]], [[irony]], dialogue, and other forms of phonetic variations. Stylistic analysis can also include the study of language in canonical works of literature, popular fiction, news, advertisements, and other forms of communication in popular culture as well. It is usually seen as a variation in communication that changes from speaker to speaker and community to community. In short, Stylistics is the interpretation of text.\n\nIn the 1960s, [[Jacques Derrida]], for instance, further distinguished between speech and writing, by proposing that written language be studied as a linguistic medium of communication in itself.<ref>[[Writing and Difference]] by Jacques Derrida, 1967, and [[Of Grammatology]]</ref> [[Palaeography]] is therefore the discipline that studies the evolution of written scripts (as signs and symbols) in language.<ref>Chapter 1, section 1.1 in {{cite book|title=Trends in Linguistics: Runes and Germanic Linguistics|year=2002|publisher=Mouton de Gruyter|isbn =978-3-11-017462-5|url= https://books.google.com/?id=gvSi3JVNRFQC |edition= 6th |author=Elmer H.

In the humanistic reference, the terms [[structuralism]] and [[Structural functionalism|functionalism]] are related to their meaning in other human sciences. The difference between formal and functional structuralism lies in the way that the two approaches explain why languages have the properties they have. Functional [[explanation]] entails the idea that language is a tool for [[communication]], or that communication is the primary function of language. Linguistic forms are consequently explained by an appeal to their functional value, or usefulness. Other structuralist approaches take the perspective that form follows from the inner mechanisms of the binary or multilayered language system.<ref>{{cite book |last=Dane\u0161 |first=Franti\u0161ek |editor-last=Dirven |editor-first=R. | editor-last2=Fried |editor-first2=V. | title=Functionalism in Linguistics |publisher=John Benjamins |date=1987 |pages=3\u201338 |chapter=On Prague school functionalism in linguistics |isbn= 9789027215246|author-link= Franti\u0161ek Dane\u0161}}</ref>\n\n===Biological===\n\nOther linguistics frameworks take as their starting point the notion that language is a [[Biological phenomena|biological phenomenon]] in humans.

This is analogous to practice in other sciences: a [[zoologist]] studies the animal kingdom without making subjective judgments on whether a particular species is \"better\" or \"worse\" than another.\n\n[[Linguistic prescription|Prescription]], on the other hand, is an attempt to promote particular linguistic usages over others, often favouring a particular dialect or \"[[acrolect]]\". This may have the aim of establishing a [[Standard language|linguistic standard]], which can aid communication over large geographical areas. It may also, however, be an attempt by speakers of one language or dialect to exert influence over speakers of other languages or dialects (see [[Linguistic imperialism]]). An extreme version of prescriptivism can be found among [[censorship|censors]], who attempt to eradicate words and structures that they consider to be destructive to society. Prescription, however, may be practised appropriately in [[language education|language instruction]], like in [[English language teaching|ELT]], where certain fundamental grammatical rules and lexical items need to be introduced to a second-language speaker who is attempting to [[language acquisition|acquire]] the language.\n\n===Anthropology===\nThe objective of describing languages is often to uncover cultural knowledge about communities. The use of [[anthropology|anthropological]] methods of investigation on linguistic sources leads to the discovery of certain cultural traits among a speech community through its linguistic features. It is also widely used as a tool in [[language documentation]], with an endeavour to curate [[endangered languages]]. However, linguistic inquiry now uses the anthropological method to understand cognitive, historical, sociolinguistic and historical processes that languages undergo as they change and evolve, as well as general anthropological inquiry uses the linguistic method to excavate into culture. In all aspects, anthropological inquiry usually uncovers the different variations and relativities that underlie the usage of language.\n\n===Sources===\nMost contemporary linguists work under the assumption that [[spoken language|spoken data]] and [[Sign language|signed data]] are more fundamental than [[written language|written data]]. This is because\n* Speech appears to be universal to all human beings capable of producing and perceiving it, while there have been many [[culture]]s and speech communities that lack written communication;\n* Features appear in speech which aren't always recorded in writing, including [[phonological rule]]s, [[sound change]]s, and [[speech error]]s;\n* All natural writing systems reflect a spoken language (or potentially a signed one), even with [[pictographic]] scripts like [[Dongba]] writing [[Naxi language|Naxi]] [[homophone]]s with the same pictogram, and text in writing systems used for [[List of languages by writing system|two languages]] changing to fit the spoken language being recorded;\n* Speech evolved before human beings invented writing;\n* People learnt to speak and process spoken language more easily and earlier than they did with [[writing]].\n\nNonetheless, linguists agree that the study of written language can be worthwhile and valuable. For research that relies on [[corpus linguistics]] and [[computational linguistics]], written language is often much more convenient for processing large amounts of linguistic data. Large corpora of spoken language are difficult to create and hard to find, and are typically [[transcription (linguistics)|transcribed]] and written. In addition, linguists have turned to text-based discourse occurring in various formats of [[computer-mediated communication]] as a viable site for linguistic inquiry.\n\nThe study of [[writing systems]] themselves, [[graphemics]], is, in any case, considered a branch of linguistics.\n\n===Analysis===\nBefore the 20th century, linguists analysed language on a [[diachronic linguistics|diachronic]] plane, which was historical in focus. This meant that they would compare linguistic features and try to analyse language from the point of view of how it had changed between then and later. However, with [[Ferdinand de Saussure|Saussurean]] linguistics in the 20th century, the focus shifted to a more [[synchronic linguistics|synchronic]] approach, where the study was more geared towards analysis and comparison between different language variations, which existed at the same given point of time.\n\nAt another level, the [[syntagmatic analysis|syntagmatic]] plane of linguistic analysis entails the comparison between the way words are sequenced, within the syntax of a sentence. For example, the article \"the\" is followed by a noun, because of the syntagmatic relation between the words. The [[paradigmatic analysis|paradigmatic]] plane on the other hand, focuses on an analysis that is based on the [[paradigms]] or concepts that are embedded in a given text. In this case, words of the same type or class may be replaced in the text with each other to achieve the same conceptual understanding.\n\n==History==\n{{main|History of linguistics}}\n\n===Nomenclature===\nBefore the 20th century, the term ''[[philology]]'', first attested in 1716,<ref name=\"Etymonline Definition of Philology\">{{OEtymD|philology|accessdate=2018-03-05}}</ref> was commonly used to refer to the study of language, which was then predominantly historical in focus.<ref name= \"Introduction: Philology in a Manuscript Culture by Stephen G.

P\u0101\u1e47ini's systematic classification of the sounds of Sanskrit into [[consonant]]s and [[vowel]]s, and word classes, such as nouns and verbs, was the first known instance of its kind. In the [[Middle East]], [[Sibawayh]], a non-Arab, made a detailed description of Arabic in AD 760 in his monumental work, ''Al-kitab fi al-nahw'' ({{lang|ar|\u0627\u0644\u0643\u062a\u0627\u0628 \u0641\u064a \u0627\u0644\u0646\u062d\u0648}}, ''The Book on Grammar''), the first known author to distinguish between [[phonetics|sounds]] and [[phonology|phonemes (sounds as units of a linguistic system)]].  Western interest in the study of languages began somewhat later than in the East,<ref>{{harvnb|Bloomfield|1983|p=307}}.</ref> but the grammarians of the classical languages did not use the same methods or reach the same conclusions as their contemporaries in the Indic world. Early interest in language in the West was a part of philosophy, not of grammatical description. The first insights into semantic theory were made by [[Plato]] in his [[Cratylus (dialogue)|''Cratylus'' dialogue]], where he argues that words denote concepts that are eternal and exist in the world of ideas. This work is the first to use the word [[etymology]] to describe the history of a word's meaning. Around 280 BC, one of [[Alexander the Great]]'s successors founded a university (see [[Musaeum]]) in [[Alexandria]], where a school of philologists studied the ancient texts in and taught [[Greek language|Greek]] to speakers of other languages. While this school was the first to use the word \"[[grammar]]\" in its modern sense, Plato had used the word in its original meaning as \"[[Art of Grammar|t\u00e9chn\u0113 grammatik\u1e17]]\" ({{script|Grek|\u03a4\u03ad\u03c7\u03bd\u03b7 \u0393\u03c1\u03b1\u03bc\u03bc\u03b1\u03c4\u03b9\u03ba\u03ae}}), the \"art of writing\", which is also the title of one of the most important works of the Alexandrine school by [[Dionysius Thrax]].<ref>{{Cite book|author=Seuren, Pieter A.

The study of language was broadened from [[Indo-European languages|Indo-European]] to language in general by [[Wilhelm von Humboldt]], of whom Bloomfield asserts:<ref name=\"Bloomfield 1914 311\"/>\n\n<blockquote>This study received its foundation at the hands of the Prussian statesman and scholar Wilhelm von Humboldt (1767\u20131835), especially in the first volume of his work on Kavi, the literary language of Java, entitled ''\u00dcber die Verschiedenheit des menschlichen Sprachbaues und ihren Einflu\u00df auf die geistige Entwickelung des Menschengeschlechts'' (''On the Variety of the Structure of Human Language and its Influence upon the Mental Development of the Human Race'').</blockquote>\n\n===20th century developments===\n\nThere was a shift of focus from historical and comparative linguistics to synchronic analysis in early 20th century. Structural analysis was improved by Leonard Bloomfield, [[Louis Hjelmslev]]; and [[Zellig Harris]] who also developed methods of [[discourse analysis]]. Functional analysis was developed by the [[Prague linguistic circle]] and [[Andr\u00e9 Martinet]]. As sound recording devices became commonplace in the 1960s, dialectal recordings were made and archived, and the [[audio-lingual method]] provided a technological solution to foreign language learning. The 1960s also saw a new rise of comparative linguistics: the study of [[language universals]] in [[linguistic typology]]. Towards the end of the century the field of linguistics became divided into further areas of interest with the advent of [[language technology]] and digitalised [[corpus linguistics|corpora]].\n\n==Areas of research==\n\n===Ecolinguistics===\n[[Ecolinguistics]] explores the role of language in the life-sustaining interactions of humans, other species and the physical environment. The first aim is to develop linguistic theories which see humans not only as part of society, but also as part of the larger ecosystems that life depends on. The second aim is to show how linguistics can be used to address key ecological issues, from climate change and [[biodiversity loss]] to environmental justice.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://ecolinguistics-association.org/ |title=Ecolinguistics Association}}</ref>\n\n===Sociolinguistics===\n[[Sociolinguistics]] is the study of how language is shaped by social factors. This sub-discipline focuses on the synchronic approach of linguistics, and looks at how a language in general, or a set of languages, display variation and varieties at a given point in time. The study of language variation and the different varieties of language through dialects, registers, and idiolects can be tackled through a study of style, as well as through analysis of discourse. Sociolinguists research both style and discourse in language, as well as the theoretical factors that are at play between language and society.\n\n===Developmental linguistics===\n[[Developmental linguistics]] is the study of the development of linguistic ability in individuals, particularly [[Language acquisition|the acquisition of language]] in childhood. Some of the questions that developmental linguistics looks into is how children acquire different languages, how adults can acquire a second language, and what the process of language acquisition is.\n\n===Neurolinguistics===\n[[Neurolinguistics]] is the study of the structures in the human brain that underlie grammar and communication. Researchers are drawn to the field from a variety of backgrounds, bringing along a variety of experimental techniques as well as widely varying theoretical perspectives. Much work in neurolinguistics is informed by models in [[psycholinguistics]] and [[theoretical linguistics]], and is focused on investigating how the brain can implement the processes that theoretical and psycholinguistics propose are necessary in producing and comprehending language. Neurolinguists study the physiological mechanisms by which the brain processes information related to language, and evaluate linguistic and psycholinguistic theories, using [[aphasiology]], [[brain imaging]], electrophysiology, and computer modelling. Amongst the structures of the brain involved in the mechanisms of neurolinguistics, the cerebellum which contains the highest numbers of neurons has a major role in terms of predictions required to produce language.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Mari\u00ebn|first=Peter|last2=Manto|first2=Mario|date=2017-10-25|title=Cerebellum as a Master-Piece for Linguistic Predictability|journal=Cerebellum (London, England)|volume=17|issue=2|pages=101\u201303|doi=10.1007/s12311-017-0894-1|issn=1473-4230|pmid=29071518}}</ref>\n\n===Applied linguistics===\n{{Main|Applied linguistics}}\nLinguists are largely concerned with finding and [[descriptive linguistics|describing]] the generalities and varieties both within particular languages and among all languages. [[Applied linguistics]] takes the results of those findings and \"applies\" them to other areas. Linguistic research is commonly applied to areas such as [[language education]], [[lexicography]], [[translation]], [[language planning]], which involves governmental policy implementation related to language use, and [[natural language processing]]. \"Applied linguistics\" has been argued to be something of a misnomer.<ref>{{cite book|title=Controversies in Applied Linguistics (pp. 288) |author=Barbara Seidlhofer |publisher=Oxford University Press |year=2003 |isbn=978-0-19-437444-6}}</ref> Applied linguists actually focus on making sense of and engineering solutions for real-world linguistic problems, and not literally \"applying\" existing technical knowledge from linguistics. Moreover, they commonly apply technical knowledge from multiple sources, such as sociology (e.g., conversation analysis) and anthropology. ([[Constructed language]] fits under Applied linguistics.)\n\nToday, computers are widely used in many areas of applied linguistics. [[Speech synthesis]] and [[speech recognition]] use phonetic and phonemic knowledge to provide [[voice interface]]s to computers. Applications of [[computational linguistics]] in [[machine translation]], [[computer-assisted translation]], and [[natural language processing]] are areas of applied linguistics that have come to the forefront. Their influence has had an effect on theories of syntax and semantics, as modelling syntactic and semantic theories on computers constraints.\n\nLinguistic analysis is a sub-discipline of applied linguistics used by many governments to verify the claimed [[nationality]] of people seeking asylum who do not hold the necessary documentation to prove their claim.<ref name=\"Linguistic Analysis\">{{cite journal | title=Applied Linguistics and Language Analysis in Asylum Seeker Cases | last=Eades | first=Diana | journal=Applied Linguistics | year=2005 | volume=26 | issue=4 | pages=503\u201326 | doi=10.1093/applin/ami021 | url=http://songchau.googlepages.com/503.pdf | ref=harv}}</ref> This often takes the form of an [[interview]] by personnel in an immigration department. Depending on the country, this interview is conducted either in the asylum seeker's [[native language]] through an [[language interpretation|interpreter]] or in an international ''[[lingua franca]]'' like English.<ref name=\"Linguistic Analysis\"/> Australia uses the former method, while Germany employs the latter; the Netherlands uses either method depending on the languages involved.<ref name=\"Linguistic Analysis\"/> Tape recordings of the interview then undergo language analysis, which can be done either by private contractors or within a department of the government. In this analysis, linguistic features of the asylum seeker are used by analysts to make a determination about the speaker's nationality. The reported findings of the linguistic analysis can play a critical role in the government's decision on the refugee status of the asylum seeker.<ref name=\"Linguistic Analysis\"/>\n\n===Semiotics===\n[[Semiotics]] is the study of sign processes (semiosis), or signification and communication, signs, and symbols, both individually and grouped into sign systems, including the study of how meaning is constructed and understood. Semioticians often do not restrict themselves to linguistic communication when studying the use of signs but extend the meaning of \"sign\" to cover all kinds of cultural symbols. Nonetheless, semiotic disciplines closely related to linguistics are [[literary studies]], [[discourse analysis]], [[text linguistics]], and [[philosophy of language]]. Semiotics, within the linguistics paradigm, is the study of the relationship between language and culture. Historically, [[Edward Sapir]] and [[Ferdinand De Saussure]]'s structuralist theories influenced the study of signs extensively until the late part of the 20th century, but later, post-modern and post-structural thought, through language philosophers including [[Jacques Derrida]], [[Mikhail Bakhtin]], [[Michel Foucault]], and others, have also been a considerable influence on the discipline in the late part of the 20th century and early 21st century.<ref>{{Cite journal|title=The Classical Roots of Post-Structuralism: Lacan, Derrida and Foucault |journal=International Journal of the Classical Tradition  |first= Paul Allen |last=Miller |year=1998 |jstor=30222818|ref=harv|volume=5 |issue=2  |pages=204\u201325 |doi=10.1007/bf02688423}}</ref> These theories emphasize the role of language variation, and the idea of subjective usage, depending on external elements like social and cultural factors, rather than merely on the interplay of formal elements.\n\n===Language documentation===\n\n[[Language documentation]] combines anthropological inquiry (into the history and culture of language) with linguistic inquiry, in order to describe languages and their grammars. [[Lexicography]] involves the documentation of words that form a vocabulary. Such a documentation of a linguistic vocabulary from a particular language is usually compiled in a [[dictionary]]. [[Computational linguistics]] is concerned with the statistical or rule-based modeling of natural language from a computational perspective. Specific knowledge of language is applied by speakers during the act of [[translation]] and [[Language interpretation|interpretation]], as well as in [[language education]] \u2013 the teaching of a second or [[foreign language]]. Policy makers work with governments to implement new plans in education and teaching which are based on linguistic research.\n\nSince the inception of the discipline of linguistics, linguists have been concerned with describing and analysing previously [[language documentation|undocumented languages]]. Starting with [[Franz Boas]] in the early 1900s, this became the main focus of American linguistics until the rise of formal structural linguistics in the mid-20th century. This focus on language documentation was partly motivated by a concern to document the rapidly [[language death|disappearing]] languages of indigenous peoples. The ethnographic dimension of the Boasian approach to language description played a role in the development of disciplines such as [[sociolinguistics]], [[anthropological linguistics]], and [[linguistic anthropology]], which investigate the relations between language, culture, and society.\n\nThe emphasis on linguistic description and documentation has also gained prominence outside North America, with the documentation of rapidly dying indigenous languages becoming a primary focus in many university programmes in linguistics. Language description is a work-intensive endeavour, usually requiring years of field work in the language concerned, so as to equip the linguist to write a sufficiently accurate reference grammar. Further, the task of documentation requires the linguist to collect a substantial corpus in the language in question, consisting of texts and recordings, both sound and video, which can be stored in an accessible format within open repositories, and used for further research.<ref>Himmelman, Nikolaus \"Language documentation: What is it and what is it good for?\" in P. Gippert, Jost, Nikolaus P Himmelmann & Ulrike Mosel. (2006) ''Essentials of Language documentation''. Mouton de Gruyter, Berlin & New York.</ref>\n\n===Translation===\nThe sub-field of [[translation]] includes the translation of written and spoken texts across media, from digital to print and spoken. To translate literally means to transmute the meaning from one language into another. Translators are often employed by organizations such as travel agencies and governmental embassies to facilitate communication between two speakers who do not know each other's language. Translators are also employed to work within [[computational linguistics]] setups like [[Google Translate]], which is an automated program to translate words and phrases between any two or more given languages. Translation is also conducted by publishing houses, which convert works of writing from one language to another in order to reach varied audiences. Academic translators specialize in or are familiar with various other disciplines such as technology, science, law, economics, etc.\n\n===Biolinguistics===\n[[Biolinguistics]] is the study of the biology and evolution of language. It is a highly interdisciplinary field, including linguists, biologists, neuroscientists, psychologists, mathematicians, and others. By shifting the focus of investigation in linguistics to a comprehensive scheme that embraces the natural sciences, it seeks to yield a framework by which the fundamentals of the faculty of language are understood.\n\n===Clinical linguistics===\nClinical linguistics is the application of linguistic theory to the field of [[Speech-Language Pathology|speech-language pathology]]. Speech language pathologists work on corrective measures to treat [[communication disorders|communication]] and swallowing disorders.\n\nChaika (1990) showed that people with schizophrenia who display speech disorders like rhyming inappropriately have attentional dysfunction, as when a patient was shown a color chip and then asked to identify it, responded \"looks like clay. Sounds like gray. Take you for a roll in the hay. Heyday, May Day.\" The color chip was actually clay-colored, so his first response was correct.'\n\nHowever, most people suppress or ignore words which rhyme with what they've said unless they are deliberately producing a pun, poem or rap. Even then, the speaker shows connection between words chosen for rhyme and an overall meaning in discourse. People with schizophrenia with speech dysfunction show no such relation between rhyme and reason. Some even produce stretches of gibberish combined with recognizable words.<ref>Chaika, Elaine Ostrach. 1990. Understanding Psychotic Speech: Between Freud and Chomsky. Chas. Thomas Publishers.</ref>\n\n===Computational linguistics===\n[[Computational linguistics]] is the study of linguistic issues in a way that is \"computationally responsible\", i.e., taking careful note of computational consideration of algorithmic specification and computational complexity, so that the linguistic theories devised can be shown to exhibit certain desirable computational properties and their implementations. Computational linguists also work on computer language and software development.\n\n===Evolutionary linguistics===\n[[Evolutionary linguistics]] is the interdisciplinary study of the emergence of the language faculty through [[human evolution]], and also the application of [[evolution|evolutionary theory]] to the study of cultural evolution among different languages. It is also a study of the dispersal of various languages across the globe, through movements among ancient communities.<ref>{{cite journal | last = Croft | first = William |date=October 2008 | title = Evolutionary Linguistics | journal = Annual Review of Anthropology | volume = 37 | pages = 219\u201334  | doi = 10.1146/annurev.anthro.37.081407.085156 | ref = harv}}</ref>\n\n===Forensic linguistics===\n[[Forensic linguistics]] is the application of linguistic analysis to [[forensics]]. Forensic analysis investigates the style, language, lexical use, and other linguistic and grammatical features used in the legal context to provide evidence in courts of law.

Historical linguistics was among the first sub-disciplines to emerge in linguistics, and was the most widely practised form of linguistics in the late 19th century.{{cn|date=February 2020}} There was a shift of focus in the early twentieth century to the synchronic approach (the systemic study of the current stage in languages), but historical research remained a field of linguistic inquiry. Subfields include [[language change]] and [[grammaticalisation]] studies.\n\nWestern modern historical [[linguistics]] dates from the late 18th century.  It grew out of the earlier discipline of [[philology]],<ref>{{Cite book|title=Historical Linguistics: An Introduction|last=Campbell|first=Lyle|publisher=Edinburgh University Press|year=1998|isbn=978-0-7486-4601-2|location=Edinburgh|pages=391}}</ref> the study of ancient texts and documents dating back to [[wikt:antiquity|antiquity]].\n\nAt first, historical linguistics served as the cornerstone of [[comparative linguistics]] primarily as a tool for linguistic reconstruction.<ref name=\"Routledge introduction\">\"Editors' Introduction: Foundations of the new historical linguistics.\" In. ''The Routledge Handbook of Historical Linguistics'' Routledge p.&nbsp;25.</ref>  Scholars were concerned chiefly with establishing language families and reconstructing prehistoric proto-languages, using the [[comparative method]] and [[internal reconstruction]].<ref name=\"Routledge introduction\" /> The focus was initially on the well-known [[Indo-European languages]], many of which had long written histories; the scholars also studied the [[Uralic languages]], another European language family for which less early written material exists. Since then, there has been significant comparative linguistic work expanding outside of European languages as well, such as on the [[Austronesian languages]] and various families of [[Native American languages]], among many others. Comparative linguistics is now, however, only a part of a more broadly conceived discipline of historical linguistics. For the Indo-European languages, comparative study is now a highly specialized field.  Most research is being carried out on the subsequent development of these languages, in particular, the development of the modern standard varieties.\n\nSome scholars have undertaken studies attempting to establish super-families, linking, for example, Indo-European, Uralic, and other families into [[Nostratic]].  These attempts have not been accepted widely.  The information necessary to establish relatedness becomes less available as the time depth is increased. The time-depth of linguistic methods is limited due to chance word resemblances and variations between language groups, but a limit of around 10,000 years is often assumed.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Baldi|first=Philip|author-link=Philip Baldi|year=2012|title=Historical Linguistics and Cognitive Science|url=http://www.personal.psu.edu/ped10/Giuli_Dussias/Publications/External/Baldi_Dussias_Rhesis_2012_GD_09_13_2012.pdf|journal=Rheis, International Journal of Linguistics, Philology and Literature|volume=3|issue=1|pages=5\u201327}} p.&nbsp;11.</ref> The dating of the various proto-languages is also difficult; several methods are available for dating, but only approximate results can be obtained.\n\n=== Syntax and morphology===\n{{main|Syntax|Morphology (linguistics)}}\nSyntax and morphology are branches of linguistics concerned with the order and structure of meaningful linguistic units such as words and [[morphemes]]. Syntacticians study the rules and constraints that govern how speakers of a language can organize words into sentences. Morphologists study similar rules for the order of morphemes\u2014sub-word units such as prefixes and suffixes\u2014and how they may be combined to form words.\n\nWhile words, along with [[clitic]]s, are generally accepted as being the smallest units of [[syntax]], in most languages, if not all, many words can be related to other words by rules that collectively describe the [[grammar]] for that language. For example, [[English language|English]] speakers recognize that the words ''dog'' and ''dogs'' are closely related, differentiated only by the [[plural]]ity [[morpheme]] \"-s\", only found [[Bound morpheme|bound]] to [[noun phrase]]s. Speakers of English, a [[fusional language]], recognize these relations from their innate knowledge of English's rules of [[word formation]]. They infer intuitively that ''dog'' is to ''dogs'' as ''cat'' is to ''cats''; and, in similar fashion, ''dog'' is to ''dog catcher'' as ''dish'' is to ''dishwasher''. By contrast, [[Classical Chinese]] has very little morphology, using almost exclusively unbound morphemes (\"free\" morphemes) and depending on [[word order]] to convey meaning. (Most words in modern [[Standard Chinese]] [\"Mandarin\"], however, are [[Compound (linguistics)|compounds]] and most [[Root (linguistics)|roots]] are bound.) These are understood as grammars that represent the morphology of the language. The rules understood by a speaker reflect specific patterns or regularities in the way words are formed from smaller units in the language they are using, and how those smaller units interact in speech. In this way, morphology is the branch of linguistics that studies patterns of word formation within and across languages and attempts to formulate rules that model the knowledge of the speakers of those languages.\n\n[[Phonological]] and [[orthography|orthographic]] modifications between a base word and its origin may be partial to [[literacy]] skills. Studies have indicated that the presence of modification in phonology and orthography makes morphologically complex words harder to understand and that the absence of modification between a base word and its origin makes morphologically complex words easier to understand. Morphologically complex words are easier to comprehend when they include a base word.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Wilson-Fowler, E.B.|first=& Apel, K.|date=2015|title=Influence of Morphological Awareness on College Students' Literacy Skills: A path Analytic Approach|url=|journal=Journal of Literacy Research|volume=47 |issue=3|pages=405\u201332|doi=10.1177/1086296x15619730}}</ref>\n\n[[Polysynthetic language]]s, such as [[Chukchi language|Chukchi]], have words composed of many morphemes. The Chukchi word \"t\u0259mey\u014b\u0259levtp\u0259\u03b3t\u0259rk\u0259n\", for example, meaning \"I have a fierce headache\", is composed of eight morphemes ''t-\u0259-mey\u014b-\u0259-levt-p\u0259\u03b3t-\u0259-rk\u0259n'' that may be [[Gloss (annotation)|glossed]]. The morphology of such languages allows for each [[consonant]] and [[vowel]] to be understood as [[morphemes]], while the grammar of the language indicates the usage and understanding of each morpheme.\n\nThe discipline that deals specifically with the sound changes occurring within morphemes is [[morphophonology]].\n\n=== Semantics and pragmatics ===\n{{main|Semantics|Pragmatics}}\nSemantics and pragmatics are branches of linguistics concerned with meaning. These subfields have traditionally been divided by the role of linguistic and social context in the determination of meaning. Semantics in this conception is concerned with core meanings and pragmatics concerned with meaning in context. Pragmatics encompasses [[speech act]] theory, conversational [[implicature]], [[Conversation analysis|talk in interaction]] and other approaches to language behavior in [[Philosophy of language|philosophy]], [[Sociology of language|sociology]], linguistics and [[anthropology]].<ref name=Mey>Mey, Jacob L. (1993) ''Pragmatics: An Introduction''. Oxford: Blackwell (2nd ed. 2001).</ref> Unlike [[semantics]], which examines meaning that is conventional or \"coded\" in a given language, pragmatics studies how the transmission of meaning depends not only on structural and linguistic knowledge ([[grammar]], [[lexicon]], etc.) of the speaker and listener but also on the context of the utterance,<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.linguisticsociety.org/resource/meaning-semantics-and-pragmatics|title=Meaning (Semantics and Pragmatics) {{!}} Linguistic Society of America|website=www.linguisticsociety.org|access-date=2017-08-25}}</ref> any pre-existing knowledge about those involved, the inferred [[intention|intent]] of the speaker, and other factors.<ref>{{cite web\n |last        = Shaozhong\n |first       = Liu\n |title       = What is pragmatics?\n |url         = http://www.gxnu.edu.cn/Personal/szliu/definition.html\n |accessdate  = 18 March 2009\n |url-status     = dead\n |archiveurl  = https://web.archive.org/web/20090307222541/http://www.gxnu.edu.cn/Personal/szliu/definition.html\n |archivedate = 7 March 2009\n}}\n</ref> In that respect, pragmatics explains how language users are able to overcome apparent [[ambiguity]] since meaning relies on the manner, place, time, etc. of an utterance.<ref name=Mey/><ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.thoughtco.com/pragmatics-language-1691654|title=What Is Pragmatics?|work=ThoughtCo|access-date=2017-07-11}}</ref>\n\n=== Phonetics and phonology ===\n{{main|Phonetics|Phonology}}\nPhonetics and phonology are branches of linguistics concerned with sounds (or the equivalent aspects of sign languages). Phonetics is largely concerned with the physical aspects of sounds such as their acoustics, production, and perception. Phonology is concerned with the linguistic abstractions and categorizations of sounds.\n\n== Language varieties ==\n{{see|Variety (linguistics)}}\nLanguages exist on a wide continuum of conventionalization with blurry divisions between concepts such as dialects and languages. Languages can undergo internal changes which lead to the development of subvarieties such as [[linguistic register]]s, accents, and dialects. Similarly, languages can undergo changes caused by contact with speakers of other languages, and new language varieties may be born from these contact situations through the process of [[language genesis]].\n\n=== Contact varieties ===\n{{see|Creolistics}}\nContact varieties such as pidgins and creoles are language varieties that often arise in situations of sustained contact between communities that speak different languages. [[Pidgin]]s are language varieties with limited conventionalization where ideas are conveyed through simplified grammars that may grow more complex as linguistic contact continues. [[Creole language]]s are language varieties similar to pidgins but with greater conventionalization and stability. As children grow up in contact situations, they may learn a local pidgin as their native language. Through this process of acquisition and transmission, new grammatical features and lexical items are created and introduced to fill [[lexical gap|gaps]] in the pidgin eventually developing into a complete language.\n\nNot all language contact situations result in the development of a pidgin or creole, and researchers have studied the features of contact situations that make contact varieties more likely to develop. Often these varieties arise in situations of [[colonization]] and [[slavery|enslavement]], where power imbalances prevent the contact groups from learning the other's language but sustained contact is nevertheless maintained. The subjugated language in the power relationship is the [[substrate language]], while the dominant language serves as the [[superstrate]]. Often the words and lexicon of a contact variety come from the superstrate, making it the [[lexifier]], while grammatical structures come from the substrate, but this is not always the case.<ref>{{cite book|last=Selbach|first=Rachel|year=2008|chapter=The superstrate is not always the lexi\ufb01er: Lingua Franca in the Barbary Coast 1530\u20141830|title=Roots of creole structures: Weighing the contribution of substrates and superstrates|volume=33|series=Creole Language Library|editor-last=Michaelis|editor-first=Susanne}}</ref>\n\n=== Dialect ===\nA dialect is a [[variety (linguistics)|variety]] of [[language]] that is characteristic of a particular group among the language's speakers.<ref>[http://dictionary.oed.com/cgi/entry/50063104?query_type=word&queryword=dialect&first=1&max_to_show=10&sort_type=alpha&result_place=1&search_id=tFGd-Bh8USU-18775&hilite=50063104 Oxford English dictionary.]</ref> The group of people who are the speakers of a dialect are usually bound to each other by social identity. This is what differentiates a dialect from a [[register (sociolinguistics)|register]] or a [[discourse]], where in the latter case, cultural identity does not always play a role. Dialects are speech varieties that have their own grammatical and phonological rules, linguistic features, and stylistic aspects, but have not been given an official status as a language. Dialects often move on to gain the status of a language due to political and social reasons. Other times, dialects remain marginalized, particularly when they are associated with marginalized social groups.<ref>{{Cite book|title=English with an accent: Language, ideology and discrimination in the United States|last=Lippi-Green|first=Rosina|publisher=Routledge|year=2012|isbn=|location=|pages=}}</ref>{{page needed|date=September 2019}} Differentiation amongst dialects (and subsequently, languages) is based upon the use of grammatical rules, syntactic rules, and stylistic features, though not always on lexical use or vocabulary. The popular saying that \"[[a language is a dialect with an army and navy]]\" is attributed as a definition formulated by [[Max Weinreich]].\n\n<blockquote>\"We may as individuals be rather fond of our own dialect. This should not make us think, though, that it is actually any better than any other dialect. Dialects are not good or bad, nice or nasty, right or wrong&nbsp;\u2013 they are just different from one another, and it is the mark of a civilised society that it tolerates different dialects just as it tolerates different races, religions and sexes.\"<ref>Trudgill, P. (1994). Dialects. ''Ebooks Online'' Routledge. Florence, KY.</ref></blockquote>\n\n===Standard language===\n{{Unreferenced section|date=December 2018}}\nWhen a dialect is documented sufficiently through the linguistic description of its grammar, which has emerged through the consensual laws from within its community, it gains political and national recognition through a country or region's policies. That is the stage when a language is considered a [[standard variety]], one whose grammatical laws have now stabilised from within the consent of [[speech community]] participants, after sufficient evolution, improvisation, correction, and growth. The English language, besides perhaps the French language, may be examples of languages that have arrived at a stage where they are said to have become standard varieties.\n\n===Relativity===\nAs constructed popularly through the [[linguistic relativity|Sapir\u2013Whorf hypothesis]], relativists believe that the structure of a particular language is capable of influencing the cognitive patterns through which a person shapes his or her [[world view]]. Universalists believe that there are commonalities between human perception as there is in the human capacity for language, while relativists believe that this varies from language to language and person to person. While the Sapir\u2013Whorf hypothesis is an elaboration of this idea expressed through the writings of American linguists [[Edward Sapir]] and [[Benjamin Lee Whorf]], it was Sapir's student [[Harry Hoijer]] who termed it thus. The 20th century German linguist [[Leo Weisgerber]] also wrote extensively about the theory of relativity. Relativists argue for the case of differentiation at the level of cognition and in semantic domains. The emergence of [[cognitive linguistics]] in the 1980s also revived an interest in linguistic relativity. Thinkers like [[George Lakoff]] have argued that language reflects different cultural metaphors, while the French philosopher of language [[Jacques Derrida]]'s writings, especially about[[deconstructivism|deconstruction]],<ref>{{cite book|author=Jacques Derrida|url=https://archive.org/details/writingdifferenc00derr_0|title=Writing and Difference|publisher=University of Chicago Press|year=1978|isbn=978-0-226-14329-3|translator=Alan Bass|url-access=registration}}</ref> have been seen to be closely associated with the relativist movement in linguistics, for which he was heavily criticized in the media at the time of his death.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/2004/nov/18/philosophy |title=Relative Thinking |work=The Guardian |first=Richard |last=Lea |date=18 November 2004}}</ref>\n\n==Structures==\n{{Unreferenced section|date=January 2019}}\nLinguistic structures are pairings of meaning and form.  Any particular pairing of meaning and form is a [[Ferdinand de Saussure|Saussurean]] [[linguistic sign|sign]].  For instance, the meaning \"cat\" is represented worldwide with a wide variety of different sound patterns (in oral languages), movements of the hands and face (in [[sign language]]s), and written symbols (in written languages). Linguistic patterns have proven their importance for the [[knowledge engineering]] field especially with the ever-increasing amount of available data.\n\nLinguists focusing on structure attempt to understand the rules regarding language use that native speakers know (not always consciously).  All linguistic structures can be broken down into component parts that are combined according to (sub)conscious rules, over multiple levels of analysis.  For instance, consider the structure of the word \"tenth\" on two different levels of analysis.  On the level of internal word structure (known as morphology), the word \"tenth\" is made up of one linguistic form indicating a number and another form indicating ordinality.  The rule governing the combination of these forms ensures that the ordinality marker \"th\" follows the number \"ten.\"  On the level of sound structure (known as phonology), structural analysis shows that the \"n\" sound in \"tenth\" is made differently from the \"n\" sound in \"ten\" spoken alone.  Although most speakers of English are consciously aware of the rules governing internal structure of the word pieces of \"tenth\", they are less often aware of the rule governing its sound structure.  Linguists focused on structure find and analyze rules such as these, which govern how native speakers use language.\n\n===Grammar===\n\n[[Grammar]] is a system of rules which governs the production and use of [[utterances]] in a given language. These rules apply to sound<ref>All references in this article to the study of sound should be taken to include the manual and non-manual signs used in [[sign language]]s.</ref> as well as meaning, and include componential subsets of rules, such as those pertaining to [[phonology]] (the organisation of phonetic sound systems), [[morphology (linguistics)|morphology]] (the formation and composition of words), and [[syntax]] (the formation and composition of phrases and sentences).<ref>{{cite book |title=Linguistics |year=2010 |publisher=The MIT Press |isbn=978-0-262-51370-8 |url=https://mitpress.mit.edu/catalog/item/examrequest.asp?ttype=2&tid=12240 |archive-url=https://archive.today/20121214215844/http://mitpress.mit.edu/catalog/item/examrequest.asp?ttype=2&tid=12240 |url-status=dead |archive-date=14 December 2012 |edition=6th |author1=Adrian Akmajian |author2=Richard A.

As a social practice, discourse embodies different ideologies through written and spoken texts. Discourse analysis can examine or expose these ideologies.   Discourse influences genre, which is chosen in response to different situations and finally, at micro level, discourse influences language as text (spoken or written) at the phonological or lexico-grammatical level. Grammar and discourse are linked as parts of a system.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Ariel|first=Mira|year=2009|title=Discourse, grammar, discourse|jstor=24049745|journal=Discourse Studies|volume=11|issue=1|pages=5\u201336|doi=10.1177/1461445608098496}}</ref>  A particular discourse becomes a language variety when it is used in this way for a particular purpose, and is referred to as a [[register (sociolinguistics)|register]].<ref>Helen Leckie-Tarry, ''Language and Context: a Functional Linguistic Theory of Register'', Continuum International Publishing Group, 1995, p.&nbsp;6. {{ISBN|1-85567-272-3}}</ref> There may be certain [[lexicon|lexical]] additions (new words) that are brought into play because of the expertise of the community of people within a certain domain of specialization. Registers and discourses therefore differentiate themselves through the use of [[vocabulary]], and at times through the use of style too. People in the medical fraternity, for example, may use some medical terminology in their communication that is specialized to the field of medicine. This is often referred to as being part of the \"medical discourse\", and so on.\n\n===Lexicon===\nThe [[lexicon]] is a catalogue of words and terms that are stored in a speaker's mind. The lexicon consists of [[words]] and [[bound morphemes]], which are parts of words that can't stand alone, like [[affixes]]. In some analyses, compound words and certain classes of idiomatic expressions and other collocations are also considered to be part of the lexicon. Dictionaries represent attempts at listing, in alphabetical order, the lexicon of a given language; usually, however, bound morphemes are not included. [[Lexicography]], closely linked with the domain of semantics, is the science of mapping the words into an [[encyclopedia]] or a [[dictionary]]. The creation and addition of new words (into the lexicon) is called coining or neologization,<ref>{{Cite book |authorlink=Ghil'ad Zuckermann |last=Zuckermann |first=Ghil'ad |year=2003 |url=http://www.palgrave.com/gb/book/9781403917232 |title=Language Contact and Lexical Enrichment in Israeli Hebrew |publisher=Palgrave Macmillan |isbn=978-1-4039-1723-2 |pages=2ff}}</ref> and the new words are called [[neologism]]s.\n\nIt is often believed that a speaker's capacity for language lies in the quantity of words stored in the lexicon. However, this is often considered a myth by linguists. The capacity for the use of language is considered by many linguists to lie primarily in the domain of grammar, and to be linked with [[linguistic competence|competence]], rather than with the growth of vocabulary. Even a very small lexicon is theoretically capable of producing an infinite number of sentences.\n\n===Style===\n[[stylistics (field of study)|Stylistics]] also involves the study of written, signed, or spoken [[discourse]] through varying speech communities, [[genres]], and editorial or [[narrative]] formats in the mass media.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.uni-giessen.de/anglistik/ling/Staff/mukherjee/pdfs/Stylistics.pdf |title=\"Stylistics\" by Joybrato Mukherjee.

Stylistic features include [[rhetoric]],<ref>{{cite book|title=The Philosophy of Rhetoric |author=IA Richards |year=1965 |publisher=Oxford University Press (New York)}}</ref> diction, stress, [[satire]], [[irony]], dialogue, and other forms of phonetic variations. Stylistic analysis can also include the study of language in canonical works of literature, popular fiction, news, advertisements, and other forms of communication in popular culture as well. It is usually seen as a variation in communication that changes from speaker to speaker and community to community. In short, Stylistics is the interpretation of text.\n\nIn the 1960s, [[Jacques Derrida]], for instance, further distinguished between speech and writing, by proposing that written language be studied as a linguistic medium of communication in itself.<ref>[[Writing and Difference]] by Jacques Derrida, 1967, and [[Of Grammatology]]</ref> [[Palaeography]] is therefore the discipline that studies the evolution of written scripts (as signs and symbols) in language.<ref>Chapter 1, section 1.1 in {{cite book|title=Trends in Linguistics: Runes and Germanic Linguistics|year=2002|publisher=Mouton de Gruyter|isbn =978-3-11-017462-5|url= https://books.google.com/?id=gvSi3JVNRFQC |edition= 6th |author=Elmer H.

In the humanistic reference, the terms [[structuralism]] and [[Structural functionalism|functionalism]] are related to their meaning in other human sciences. The difference between formal and functional structuralism lies in the way that the two approaches explain why languages have the properties they have. Functional [[explanation]] entails the idea that language is a tool for [[communication]], or that communication is the primary function of language. Linguistic forms are consequently explained by an appeal to their functional value, or usefulness. Other structuralist approaches take the perspective that form follows from the inner mechanisms of the binary or multilayered language system.<ref>{{cite book |last=Dane\u0161 |first=Franti\u0161ek |editor-last=Dirven |editor-first=R. | editor-last2=Fried |editor-first2=V. | title=Functionalism in Linguistics |publisher=John Benjamins |date=1987 |pages=3\u201338 |chapter=On Prague school functionalism in linguistics |isbn= 9789027215246|author-link= Franti\u0161ek Dane\u0161}}</ref>\n\n===Biological===\n\nOther linguistics frameworks take as their starting point the notion that language is a [[Biological phenomena|biological phenomenon]] in humans.

This is analogous to practice in other sciences: a [[zoologist]] studies the animal kingdom without making subjective judgments on whether a particular species is \"better\" or \"worse\" than another.\n\n[[Linguistic prescription|Prescription]], on the other hand, is an attempt to promote particular linguistic usages over others, often favouring a particular dialect or \"[[acrolect]]\". This may have the aim of establishing a [[Standard language|linguistic standard]], which can aid communication over large geographical areas. It may also, however, be an attempt by speakers of one language or dialect to exert influence over speakers of other languages or dialects (see [[Linguistic imperialism]]). An extreme version of prescriptivism can be found among [[censorship|censors]], who attempt to eradicate words and structures that they consider to be destructive to society. Prescription, however, may be practised appropriately in [[language education|language instruction]], like in [[English language teaching|ELT]], where certain fundamental grammatical rules and lexical items need to be introduced to a second-language speaker who is attempting to [[language acquisition|acquire]] the language.\n\n===Anthropology===\nThe objective of describing languages is often to uncover cultural knowledge about communities. The use of [[anthropology|anthropological]] methods of investigation on linguistic sources leads to the discovery of certain cultural traits among a speech community through its linguistic features. It is also widely used as a tool in [[language documentation]], with an endeavour to curate [[endangered languages]]. However, linguistic inquiry now uses the anthropological method to understand cognitive, historical, sociolinguistic and historical processes that languages undergo as they change and evolve, as well as general anthropological inquiry uses the linguistic method to excavate into culture. In all aspects, anthropological inquiry usually uncovers the different variations and relativities that underlie the usage of language.\n\n===Sources===\nMost contemporary linguists work under the assumption that [[spoken language|spoken data]] and [[Sign language|signed data]] are more fundamental than [[written language|written data]]. This is because\n* Speech appears to be universal to all human beings capable of producing and perceiving it, while there have been many [[culture]]s and speech communities that lack written communication;\n* Features appear in speech which aren't always recorded in writing, including [[phonological rule]]s, [[sound change]]s, and [[speech error]]s;\n* All natural writing systems reflect a spoken language (or potentially a signed one), even with [[pictographic]] scripts like [[Dongba]] writing [[Naxi language|Naxi]] [[homophone]]s with the same pictogram, and text in writing systems used for [[List of languages by writing system|two languages]] changing to fit the spoken language being recorded;\n* Speech evolved before human beings invented writing;\n* People learnt to speak and process spoken language more easily and earlier than they did with [[writing]].\n\nNonetheless, linguists agree that the study of written language can be worthwhile and valuable. For research that relies on [[corpus linguistics]] and [[computational linguistics]], written language is often much more convenient for processing large amounts of linguistic data. Large corpora of spoken language are difficult to create and hard to find, and are typically [[transcription (linguistics)|transcribed]] and written. In addition, linguists have turned to text-based discourse occurring in various formats of [[computer-mediated communication]] as a viable site for linguistic inquiry.\n\nThe study of [[writing systems]] themselves, [[graphemics]], is, in any case, considered a branch of linguistics.\n\n===Analysis===\nBefore the 20th century, linguists analysed language on a [[diachronic linguistics|diachronic]] plane, which was historical in focus. This meant that they would compare linguistic features and try to analyse language from the point of view of how it had changed between then and later. However, with [[Ferdinand de Saussure|Saussurean]] linguistics in the 20th century, the focus shifted to a more [[synchronic linguistics|synchronic]] approach, where the study was more geared towards analysis and comparison between different language variations, which existed at the same given point of time.\n\nAt another level, the [[syntagmatic analysis|syntagmatic]] plane of linguistic analysis entails the comparison between the way words are sequenced, within the syntax of a sentence. For example, the article \"the\" is followed by a noun, because of the syntagmatic relation between the words. The [[paradigmatic analysis|paradigmatic]] plane on the other hand, focuses on an analysis that is based on the [[paradigms]] or concepts that are embedded in a given text. In this case, words of the same type or class may be replaced in the text with each other to achieve the same conceptual understanding.\n\n==History==\n{{main|History of linguistics}}\n\n===Nomenclature===\nBefore the 20th century, the term ''[[philology]]'', first attested in 1716,<ref name=\"Etymonline Definition of Philology\">{{OEtymD|philology|accessdate=2018-03-05}}</ref> was commonly used to refer to the study of language, which was then predominantly historical in focus.<ref name= \"Introduction: Philology in a Manuscript Culture by Stephen G.

Western interest in the study of languages began somewhat later than in the East,<ref>{{harvnb|Bloomfield|1983|p=307}}.</ref> but the grammarians of the classical languages did not use the same methods or reach the same conclusions as their contemporaries in the Indic world. Early interest in language in the West was a part of philosophy, not of grammatical description. The first insights into semantic theory were made by [[Plato]] in his [[Cratylus (dialogue)|''Cratylus'' dialogue]], where he argues that words denote concepts that are eternal and exist in the world of ideas. This work is the first to use the word [[etymology]] to describe the history of a word's meaning. Around 280 BC, one of [[Alexander the Great]]'s successors founded a university (see [[Musaeum]]) in [[Alexandria]], where a school of philologists studied the ancient texts in and taught [[Greek language|Greek]] to speakers of other languages. While this school was the first to use the word \"[[grammar]]\" in its modern sense, Plato had used the word in its original meaning as \"[[Art of Grammar|t\u00e9chn\u0113 grammatik\u1e17]]\" ({{script|Grek|\u03a4\u03ad\u03c7\u03bd\u03b7 \u0393\u03c1\u03b1\u03bc\u03bc\u03b1\u03c4\u03b9\u03ba\u03ae}}), the \"art of writing\", which is also the title of one of the most important works of the Alexandrine school by [[Dionysius Thrax]].<ref>{{Cite book|author=Seuren, Pieter A.

The study of language was broadened from [[Indo-European languages|Indo-European]] to language in general by [[Wilhelm von Humboldt]], of whom Bloomfield asserts:<ref name=\"Bloomfield 1914 311\"/>\n\n<blockquote>This study received its foundation at the hands of the Prussian statesman and scholar Wilhelm von Humboldt (1767\u20131835), especially in the first volume of his work on Kavi, the literary language of Java, entitled ''\u00dcber die Verschiedenheit des menschlichen Sprachbaues und ihren Einflu\u00df auf die geistige Entwickelung des Menschengeschlechts'' (''On the Variety of the Structure of Human Language and its Influence upon the Mental Development of the Human Race'').</blockquote>\n\n===20th century developments===\n\nThere was a shift of focus from historical and comparative linguistics to synchronic analysis in early 20th century. Structural analysis was improved by Leonard Bloomfield, [[Louis Hjelmslev]]; and [[Zellig Harris]] who also developed methods of [[discourse analysis]]. Functional analysis was developed by the [[Prague linguistic circle]] and [[Andr\u00e9 Martinet]]. As sound recording devices became commonplace in the 1960s, dialectal recordings were made and archived, and the [[audio-lingual method]] provided a technological solution to foreign language learning. The 1960s also saw a new rise of comparative linguistics: the study of [[language universals]] in [[linguistic typology]]. Towards the end of the century the field of linguistics became divided into further areas of interest with the advent of [[language technology]] and digitalised [[corpus linguistics|corpora]].\n\n==Areas of research==\n\n===Ecolinguistics===\n[[Ecolinguistics]] explores the role of language in the life-sustaining interactions of humans, other species and the physical environment. The first aim is to develop linguistic theories which see humans not only as part of society, but also as part of the larger ecosystems that life depends on. The second aim is to show how linguistics can be used to address key ecological issues, from climate change and [[biodiversity loss]] to environmental justice.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://ecolinguistics-association.org/ |title=Ecolinguistics Association}}</ref>\n\n===Sociolinguistics===\n[[Sociolinguistics]] is the study of how language is shaped by social factors. This sub-discipline focuses on the synchronic approach of linguistics, and looks at how a language in general, or a set of languages, display variation and varieties at a given point in time. The study of language variation and the different varieties of language through dialects, registers, and idiolects can be tackled through a study of style, as well as through analysis of discourse. Sociolinguists research both style and discourse in language, as well as the theoretical factors that are at play between language and society.\n\n===Developmental linguistics===\n[[Developmental linguistics]] is the study of the development of linguistic ability in individuals, particularly [[Language acquisition|the acquisition of language]] in childhood. Some of the questions that developmental linguistics looks into is how children acquire different languages, how adults can acquire a second language, and what the process of language acquisition is.\n\n===Neurolinguistics===\n[[Neurolinguistics]] is the study of the structures in the human brain that underlie grammar and communication. Researchers are drawn to the field from a variety of backgrounds, bringing along a variety of experimental techniques as well as widely varying theoretical perspectives. Much work in neurolinguistics is informed by models in [[psycholinguistics]] and [[theoretical linguistics]], and is focused on investigating how the brain can implement the processes that theoretical and psycholinguistics propose are necessary in producing and comprehending language. Neurolinguists study the physiological mechanisms by which the brain processes information related to language, and evaluate linguistic and psycholinguistic theories, using [[aphasiology]], [[brain imaging]], electrophysiology, and computer modelling. Amongst the structures of the brain involved in the mechanisms of neurolinguistics, the cerebellum which contains the highest numbers of neurons has a major role in terms of predictions required to produce language.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Mari\u00ebn|first=Peter|last2=Manto|first2=Mario|date=2017-10-25|title=Cerebellum as a Master-Piece for Linguistic Predictability|journal=Cerebellum (London, England)|volume=17|issue=2|pages=101\u201303|doi=10.1007/s12311-017-0894-1|issn=1473-4230|pmid=29071518}}</ref>\n\n===Applied linguistics===\n{{Main|Applied linguistics}}\nLinguists are largely concerned with finding and [[descriptive linguistics|describing]] the generalities and varieties both within particular languages and among all languages. [[Applied linguistics]] takes the results of those findings and \"applies\" them to other areas. Linguistic research is commonly applied to areas such as [[language education]], [[lexicography]], [[translation]], [[language planning]], which involves governmental policy implementation related to language use, and [[natural language processing]]. \"Applied linguistics\" has been argued to be something of a misnomer.<ref>{{cite book|title=Controversies in Applied Linguistics (pp. 288) |author=Barbara Seidlhofer |publisher=Oxford University Press |year=2003 |isbn=978-0-19-437444-6}}</ref> Applied linguists actually focus on making sense of and engineering solutions for real-world linguistic problems, and not literally \"applying\" existing technical knowledge from linguistics. Moreover, they commonly apply technical knowledge from multiple sources, such as sociology (e.g., conversation analysis) and anthropology. ([[Constructed language]] fits under Applied linguistics.)\n\nToday, computers are widely used in many areas of applied linguistics. [[Speech synthesis]] and [[speech recognition]] use phonetic and phonemic knowledge to provide [[voice interface]]s to computers. Applications of [[computational linguistics]] in [[machine translation]], [[computer-assisted translation]], and [[natural language processing]] are areas of applied linguistics that have come to the forefront. Their influence has had an effect on theories of syntax and semantics, as modelling syntactic and semantic theories on computers constraints.\n\nLinguistic analysis is a sub-discipline of applied linguistics used by many governments to verify the claimed [[nationality]] of people seeking asylum who do not hold the necessary documentation to prove their claim.<ref name=\"Linguistic Analysis\">{{cite journal | title=Applied Linguistics and Language Analysis in Asylum Seeker Cases | last=Eades | first=Diana | journal=Applied Linguistics | year=2005 | volume=26 | issue=4 | pages=503\u201326 | doi=10.1093/applin/ami021 | url=http://songchau.googlepages.com/503.pdf | ref=harv}}</ref> This often takes the form of an [[interview]] by personnel in an immigration department. Depending on the country, this interview is conducted either in the asylum seeker's [[native language]] through an [[language interpretation|interpreter]] or in an international ''[[lingua franca]]'' like English.<ref name=\"Linguistic Analysis\"/> Australia uses the former method, while Germany employs the latter; the Netherlands uses either method depending on the languages involved.<ref name=\"Linguistic Analysis\"/> Tape recordings of the interview then undergo language analysis, which can be done either by private contractors or within a department of the government. In this analysis, linguistic features of the asylum seeker are used by analysts to make a determination about the speaker's nationality. The reported findings of the linguistic analysis can play a critical role in the government's decision on the refugee status of the asylum seeker.<ref name=\"Linguistic Analysis\"/>\n\n===Semiotics===\n[[Semiotics]] is the study of sign processes (semiosis), or signification and communication, signs, and symbols, both individually and grouped into sign systems, including the study of how meaning is constructed and understood. Semioticians often do not restrict themselves to linguistic communication when studying the use of signs but extend the meaning of \"sign\" to cover all kinds of cultural symbols. Nonetheless, semiotic disciplines closely related to linguistics are [[literary studies]], [[discourse analysis]], [[text linguistics]], and [[philosophy of language]]. Semiotics, within the linguistics paradigm, is the study of the relationship between language and culture. Historically, [[Edward Sapir]] and [[Ferdinand De Saussure]]'s structuralist theories influenced the study of signs extensively until the late part of the 20th century, but later, post-modern and post-structural thought, through language philosophers including [[Jacques Derrida]], [[Mikhail Bakhtin]], [[Michel Foucault]], and others, have also been a considerable influence on the discipline in the late part of the 20th century and early 21st century.<ref>{{Cite journal|title=The Classical Roots of Post-Structuralism: Lacan, Derrida and Foucault |journal=International Journal of the Classical Tradition  |first= Paul Allen |last=Miller |year=1998 |jstor=30222818|ref=harv|volume=5 |issue=2  |pages=204\u201325 |doi=10.1007/bf02688423}}</ref> These theories emphasize the role of language variation, and the idea of subjective usage, depending on external elements like social and cultural factors, rather than merely on the interplay of formal elements.\n\n===Language documentation===\n\n[[Language documentation]] combines anthropological inquiry (into the history and culture of language) with linguistic inquiry, in order to describe languages and their grammars. [[Lexicography]] involves the documentation of words that form a vocabulary. Such a documentation of a linguistic vocabulary from a particular language is usually compiled in a [[dictionary]]. [[Computational linguistics]] is concerned with the statistical or rule-based modeling of natural language from a computational perspective. Specific knowledge of language is applied by speakers during the act of [[translation]] and [[Language interpretation|interpretation]], as well as in [[language education]] \u2013 the teaching of a second or [[foreign language]]. Policy makers work with governments to implement new plans in education and teaching which are based on linguistic research.\n\nSince the inception of the discipline of linguistics, linguists have been concerned with describing and analysing previously [[language documentation|undocumented languages]]. Starting with [[Franz Boas]] in the early 1900s, this became the main focus of American linguistics until the rise of formal structural linguistics in the mid-20th century. This focus on language documentation was partly motivated by a concern to document the rapidly [[language death|disappearing]] languages of indigenous peoples. The ethnographic dimension of the Boasian approach to language description played a role in the development of disciplines such as [[sociolinguistics]], [[anthropological linguistics]], and [[linguistic anthropology]], which investigate the relations between language, culture, and society.\n\nThe emphasis on linguistic description and documentation has also gained prominence outside North America, with the documentation of rapidly dying indigenous languages becoming a primary focus in many university programmes in linguistics. Language description is a work-intensive endeavour, usually requiring years of field work in the language concerned, so as to equip the linguist to write a sufficiently accurate reference grammar. Further, the task of documentation requires the linguist to collect a substantial corpus in the language in question, consisting of texts and recordings, both sound and video, which can be stored in an accessible format within open repositories, and used for further research.<ref>Himmelman, Nikolaus \"Language documentation: What is it and what is it good for?\" in P. Gippert, Jost, Nikolaus P Himmelmann & Ulrike Mosel. (2006) ''Essentials of Language documentation''. Mouton de Gruyter, Berlin & New York.</ref>\n\n===Translation===\nThe sub-field of [[translation]] includes the translation of written and spoken texts across media, from digital to print and spoken. To translate literally means to transmute the meaning from one language into another. Translators are often employed by organizations such as travel agencies and governmental embassies to facilitate communication between two speakers who do not know each other's language. Translators are also employed to work within [[computational linguistics]] setups like [[Google Translate]], which is an automated program to translate words and phrases between any two or more given languages. Translation is also conducted by publishing houses, which convert works of writing from one language to another in order to reach varied audiences. Academic translators specialize in or are familiar with various other disciplines such as technology, science, law, economics, etc.\n\n===Biolinguistics===\n[[Biolinguistics]] is the study of the biology and evolution of language. It is a highly interdisciplinary field, including linguists, biologists, neuroscientists, psychologists, mathematicians, and others. By shifting the focus of investigation in linguistics to a comprehensive scheme that embraces the natural sciences, it seeks to yield a framework by which the fundamentals of the faculty of language are understood.\n\n===Clinical linguistics===\nClinical linguistics is the application of linguistic theory to the field of [[Speech-Language Pathology|speech-language pathology]]. Speech language pathologists work on corrective measures to treat [[communication disorders|communication]] and swallowing disorders.\n\nChaika (1990) showed that people with schizophrenia who display speech disorders like rhyming inappropriately have attentional dysfunction, as when a patient was shown a color chip and then asked to identify it, responded \"looks like clay. Sounds like gray. Take you for a roll in the hay. Heyday, May Day.\" The color chip was actually clay-colored, so his first response was correct.'\n\nHowever, most people suppress or ignore words which rhyme with what they've said unless they are deliberately producing a pun, poem or rap. Even then, the speaker shows connection between words chosen for rhyme and an overall meaning in discourse. People with schizophrenia with speech dysfunction show no such relation between rhyme and reason. Some even produce stretches of gibberish combined with recognizable words.<ref>Chaika, Elaine Ostrach. 1990. Understanding Psychotic Speech: Between Freud and Chomsky. Chas. Thomas Publishers.</ref>\n\n===Computational linguistics===\n[[Computational linguistics]] is the study of linguistic issues in a way that is \"computationally responsible\", i.e., taking careful note of computational consideration of algorithmic specification and computational complexity, so that the linguistic theories devised can be shown to exhibit certain desirable computational properties and their implementations. Computational linguists also work on computer language and software development.\n\n===Evolutionary linguistics===\n[[Evolutionary linguistics]] is the interdisciplinary study of the emergence of the language faculty through [[human evolution]], and also the application of [[evolution|evolutionary theory]] to the study of cultural evolution among different languages. It is also a study of the dispersal of various languages across the globe, through movements among ancient communities.<ref>{{cite journal | last = Croft | first = William |date=October 2008 | title = Evolutionary Linguistics | journal = Annual Review of Anthropology | volume = 37 | pages = 219\u201334  | doi = 10.1146/annurev.anthro.37.081407.085156 | ref = harv}}</ref>\n\n===Forensic linguistics===\n[[Forensic linguistics]] is the application of linguistic analysis to [[forensics]]. Forensic analysis investigates the style, language, lexical use, and other linguistic and grammatical features used in the legal context to provide evidence in courts of law. Forensic linguists have also used their expertise in the framework of criminal cases.\n\n==See also==\n<!--Alphabetical please-->\n{{Too many see alsos|date=August 2016}}\n{{portal|Linguistics|Language}}\n{{div col|colwidth=20em}}\n* [[Anthroponymy]]\n* [[Articulatory phonology]]\n* [[Articulatory synthesis]]\n* [[Asemic writing]]\n* [[Axiom of categoricity]]\n* [[Biosemiotics]]\n* [[Cognitive science]]\n* [[Concept mining]]\n* [[Critical discourse analysis]]\n* [[Cryptanalysis]]\n* [[Decipherment]]\n* [[Global language system]]\n* [[Grammarian (Greco-Roman world)]]\n* [[Index of linguistics articles]]\n* [[Integrational linguistics]]\n* [[Integrationism]]\n* [[Intercultural competence]]\n* [[International Congress of Linguists]]\n* [[International Linguistics Olympiad]]\n* [[Language attrition]]\n* [[Language engineering]]\n* [[Language geography]]\n* [[Linguistic typology]]\n* [[List of departments of linguistics]]\n* [[List of summer schools of linguistics]]\n* [[Metacommunicative competence]]\n* [[Microlinguistics]]\n* [[Onomastics]]\n* [[Outline of linguistics]]\n* [[Reading (process)|Reading]]\n* {{Section link|Rhythm|Linguistics}}\n* [[Speaker recognition]]\n* [[Speech processing]]\n* [[Stratificational linguistics]]\n{{div col end}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==Bibliography==\n* {{cite book | title=Linguistics: An Introduction to Language and Communication | publisher=The MIT Press |author1=Akmajian, Adrian |author2=Demers, Richard |author3=Farmer, Ann |author4=Harnish, Robert | year=2010 | location=Cambridge, MA | isbn=978-0-262-51370-8}}\n\n* {{cite book | title=The handbook of linguistics | publisher=Blackwell |editor1=Aronoff, Mark |editor2=Rees-Miller, Janie | year=2000 | location=Oxford | isbn=}}\n\n* {{cite book|ref=harv|last=Bloomfield|first=Leonard|title=An Introduction to the Study of Language: New edition|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-MN3YkwOgNYC&pg=PA307|year=1983|publisher=John Benjamins Publishing|location=Amsterdam|isbn=978-90-272-8047-3|orig-year=1914}}\n\n* {{cite book |first=Noam |last=Chomsky |title=On Language |year=1998 |publisher=The New Press, New York |isbn=978-1-56584-475-9 |url=https://archive.org/details/onlanguagechomsk00chom }}\n\n* {{cite book | first=Jacques | last=Derrida | title=Of Grammatology | year=1967 | publisher=The Johns Hopkins University Press | isbn=978-0-8018-5830-7 | url=https://archive.org/details/ofgrammatology00derr }}\n\n* {{cite book | first=Christopher | last=Hall | title=An Introduction to Language and Linguistics.
