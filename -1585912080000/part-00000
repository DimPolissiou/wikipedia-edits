Nistor''' (August 16, 1876 \u2013 November 11, 1962) was a [[Romania]]n historian and politician. He was a [[list of members of the Romanian Academy|member of the Romanian Academy]] after 1911, and served as administrator of its Library.\n\n==Biography==\nNistor was born into a family of peasants in the Bivol\u0103rie hamlet of [[Vicovul de Sus]], [[Bukovina]] \u2014 in [[Austria-Hungary]] at the time, it is now included in [[Suceava County]], Romania. He studied at the local school in Vicovul de Sus, then at Elementary School of [[R\u0103d\u0103u\u0163i]] and at the R\u0103d\u0103u\u0163i [[German language|German]] High School, getting his ''[[Matura]]'' in 1897.<ref>Neagoe, p. V</ref>\n\nHe then studied Philosophy and Literature at the [[University of Czernowitz]] and between 1898 and 1900, he completed his military service in the [[Austro-Hungarian Army]] (serving in [[Pula|Polei]] and in [[Vienna]]), and graduated from the University in 1902, after which he was named teacher of history and geography at the Suceava Classic High school.<ref>Neagoe, p. V-VI</ref> Together with some of his friends, Nistor edited a magazine titled ''Junimea Literar\u0103'' between 1904 and 1914, first published in R\u0103d\u0103u\u0163i and then in Suceava.<ref>Neagoe, p. VI</ref>\n\nIn 1904, Nistor married Virginia Pauliuc, daughter of the Gheorghe Pauliuc (a [[Romanian Orthodox Church|Romanian Orthodox]] priest from [[Burla, Suceava|Burla]]), and, one year later, on July 5, 1905, Oltea, his only child, was born.<ref>Neagoe, p. VII</ref> He then moved to teach at the Orthodox High School, making use of the institution's library, better suited to his studies into the history of [[Moldavia]].\n\nIn 1908-1909 and 1910\u20131911, he studied at the [[University of Vienna]] and completed his [[PhD]] under [[Konstantin Josef Jire\u010dek]], with a thesis on ''Moldavia's aspirations regarding [[Pokuttya]]''.<ref>Neagoe, p. VIII</ref> After that, he furthered his studies at the Universities of [[Ludwig Maximilian University of Munich|Munich]], [[University of Leipzig|Leipzig]] and [[Humboldt University of Berlin|Berlin]], receiving (1911) his ''[[Docent]]'' title and the ''[[Venia legendi]]'', which allowed him to teach at the University of Vienna, where he gave lectures on the [[History of Romania|history of the Romanians]].<ref>Neagoe, p. IX</ref>\n\nA year later, in 1912, he moved to Czernowitz, to hold the chair of [[Southeastern Europe]]an history, but after the start of [[World War I]], he moved to the [[Romanian Old Kingdom]], where he published various studies on the history of Bukovina. He was elected a member of the Romanian Academy in 1915.<ref>Neagoe, p. IX-XII</ref> He also authored an [[Ethnography|ethnographic]] map of Bukovina under [[Austria]]n domination (''see [[Cisleithania]]''), based on the census of 1910.\n\nLiving in [[Ia\u015fi]] by the time Romania entered the war on the [[Allies of World War I|Entente side]], Nistor left Romania at the climax of the [[Romanian Campaign (World War I)|Romanian Campaign]] (when troops of the [[Central Powers]] threatened the region). In July 1917, he moved to [[Odessa]], in territory held by the [[Russian Provisional Government]], and began teaching Romanian history to the (mostly [[Bessarabia]]n) students at the [[Odessa National University|University of Novorossiya]]. He interrupted the course in November 1917, after a group of armed [[October Revolution|Russian revolutionaries]] broke into the University building. Nistor was, however, safely escorted outside by some of the Bessarabian soldiers who were part of his audience.<ref>Nistor, in Neagoe, p. XIV</ref>\n\nIn February 1918, together with other Austro-Hungarian refugees (including [[Octavian Goga]]), Nistor departed for [[Ovidiopol]], [[Cetatea Alb\u0103]] and then finally reached [[Chi\u015fin\u0103u]]. He stayed in the city, where he argued for the founding of a Moldavian University, and soon began lecturing on the History of the Romanians. He used the data gathered from the Chi\u015fin\u0103u Archives to write the ''History of Bessarabia'', published in 1923. Nistor also witnessed the [[Sfatul \u021a\u0103rii]] session which voted the union with Romania.<ref>Nistor, in Neagoe, p. XIV-XV</ref>\n\nAfter the war ended, he returned to his native Bukovina and he was one of the members of the National Assembly of Bukovina in [[Chernivtsi|Cern\u0103u\u0163i]], which voted for the [[Union Day (Romania)|union with Romania]] on November 28, 1918. Nistor was also one of the fifteen Bukovinans who presented the Union Act to Romania's [[King of Romania|King]] [[Ferdinand I of Romania|Ferdinand I]].<ref>Neagoe, p. XVI</ref>\n\nNistor presided upon the [[Democratic Union Party (Bukovina)|Democratic Union Party]], which had a [[Centralized government|centralist]] agenda. Between December 18 and May 2, he was a member of [[Greater Romania]]'s [[Ion I. C. Br\u0103tianu]] government, as a Minister for Bukovina, and, between February 14 and February 27, also held the rank of minister for Bessarabia, while the nominal minister was delegated to the [[Paris Peace Conference, 1919|Paris Peace Conference]].

Nistor''' (August 16, 1876 \u2013 November 11, 1962) was a [[Romania]]n historian and politician. He was a [[list of members of the Romanian Academy|member of the Romanian Academy]] after 1911, and served as administrator of its Library.\n\n==Biography==\nNistor was born into a family of peasants in the Bivol\u0103rie hamlet of [[Vicovul de Sus]], [[Bukovina]] \u2014 in [[Austria-Hungary]] at the time, it is now included in [[Suceava County]], Romania. He studied at the local school in Vicovul de Sus, then at Elementary School of [[R\u0103d\u0103u\u0163i]] and at the R\u0103d\u0103u\u0163i [[German language|German]] High School, getting his ''[[Matura]]'' in 1897.<ref>Neagoe, p. V</ref>\n\nHe then studied Philosophy and Literature at the [[University of Czernowitz]] and between 1898 and 1900, he completed his military service in the [[Austro-Hungarian Army]] (serving in [[Pula|Polei]] and in [[Vienna]]), and graduated from the University in 1902, after which he was named teacher of history and geography at the Suceava Classic High school.<ref>Neagoe, p. V-VI</ref> Together with some of his friends, Nistor edited a magazine titled ''Junimea Literar\u0103'' between 1904 and 1914, first published in R\u0103d\u0103u\u0163i and then in Suceava.<ref>Neagoe, p. VI</ref>\n\nIn 1904, Nistor married Virginia Pauliuc, daughter of the Gheorghe Pauliuc (a [[Romanian Orthodox Church|Romanian Orthodox]] priest from [[Burla, Suceava|Burla]]), and, one year later, on July 5, 1905, Oltea, his only child, was born.<ref>Neagoe, p. VII</ref> He then moved to teach at the Orthodox High School, making use of the institution's library, better suited to his studies into the history of [[Moldavia]].\n\nIn 1908-1909 and 1910\u20131911, he studied at the [[University of Vienna]] and completed his [[PhD]] under [[Konstantin Josef Jire\u010dek]], with a thesis on ''Moldavia's aspirations regarding [[Pokuttya]]''.<ref>Neagoe, p. VIII</ref> After that, he furthered his studies at the Universities of [[Ludwig Maximilian University of Munich|Munich]], [[University of Leipzig|Leipzig]] and [[Humboldt University of Berlin|Berlin]], receiving (1911) his ''[[Docent]]'' title and the ''[[Venia legendi]]'', which allowed him to teach at the University of Vienna, where he gave lectures on the [[History of Romania|history of the Romanians]].<ref>Neagoe, p. IX</ref>\n\nA year later, in 1912, he moved to Czernowitz, to hold the chair of [[Southeastern Europe]]an history, but after the start of [[World War I]], he moved to the [[Romanian Old Kingdom]], where he published various studies on the history of Bukovina. He was elected a member of the Romanian Academy in 1915.<ref>Neagoe, p. IX-XII</ref> He also authored an [[Ethnography|ethnographic]] map of Bukovina under [[Austria]]n domination (''see [[Cisleithania]]''), based on the census of 1910.\n\nLiving in [[Ia\u015fi]] by the time Romania entered the war on the [[Allies of World War I|Entente side]], Nistor left Romania at the climax of the [[Romanian Campaign (World War I)|Romanian Campaign]] (when troops of the [[Central Powers]] threatened the region). In July 1917, he moved to [[Odessa]], in territory held by the [[Russian Provisional Government]], and began teaching Romanian history to the (mostly [[Bessarabia]]n) students at the [[Odessa National University|University of Novorossiya]]. He interrupted the course in November 1917, after a group of armed [[October Revolution|Russian revolutionaries]] broke into the University building. Nistor was, however, safely escorted outside by some of the Bessarabian soldiers who were part of his audience.<ref>Nistor, in Neagoe, p. XIV</ref>\n\nIn February 1918, together with other Austro-Hungarian refugees (including [[Octavian Goga]]), Nistor departed for [[Ovidiopol]], [[Cetatea Alb\u0103]] and then finally reached [[Chi\u015fin\u0103u]]. He stayed in the city, where he argued for the founding of a Moldavian University, and soon began lecturing on the History of the Romanians. He used the data gathered from the Chi\u015fin\u0103u Archives to write the ''History of Bessarabia'', published in 1923. Nistor also witnessed the [[Sfatul \u021a\u0103rii]] session which voted the union with Romania.<ref>Nistor, in Neagoe, p. XIV-XV</ref>\n\nAfter the war ended, he returned to his native Bukovina and he was one of the members of the National Assembly of Bukovina in [[Chernivtsi|Cern\u0103u\u0163i]], which voted for the [[Union Day (Romania)|union with Romania]] on November 28, 1918. Nistor was also one of the fifteen Bukovinans who presented the Union Act to Romania's [[King of Romania|King]] [[Ferdinand I of Romania|Ferdinand I]].<ref>Neagoe, p. XVI</ref>\n\nNistor presided upon the [[Democratic Union Party (Bukovina)|Democratic Union Party]], which had a [[Centralized government|centralist]] agenda. Between December 18 and May 2, he was a member of [[Greater Romania]]'s [[Ion I. C. Br\u0103tianu]] government, as a Minister for Bukovina, and, between February 14 and February 27, also held the rank of minister for Bessarabia, while the nominal minister was delegated to the [[Paris Peace Conference, 1919|Paris Peace Conference]]. Between May 1920 and January 1922, Nistor was a [[Senate of Romania|Senator]] in the [[Parliament of Romania]].<ref>Neagoe, p.

Austenal founders, Reiner Erdle and Charles Prange worked to improve investment chrome base castings utilizing two separate investments: The first coating named 'protective coat\" giving a smooth finish was smothered with alcohol binder investment to obtain a correct expansion. This technology replaced gold alloy with [[vitallium]] and was popular in depression time. During the 1930s, Austenal expanded into aircraft engine [[superchargers]] with superior castings when [[General Electric]] asked for help to improve manufacturing practices for wartime production demands.\n\nHowe Sound Company, a metals and mining business, acquired Austenal in 1958, and a year later in 1959, Howe acquired Michigan Steel Casting Co.

Howmet was purchased in 1975 by [[Pechiney]], a multinational aluminum company. In 1989, Pechiney purchased the Cercast group of companies, bringing Howmet into the aluminum casting industry.\n\nIn 1995, Pechiney sold Howmet to a joint venture between [[Thiokol]] and [[The Carlyle Group]]. By late 1997 the ownership structure of Howmet had morphed into a distribution of Thiokol owning 62%, Carlyle 23%, and the public 15%. Thiokol later in 1998 changed its name to Cordant Technologies Inc. By February 1999, Cordant had acquired an 84.7% stake in Howmet.\n\nIn 2000, Cordant sold its stake in Howmet Corp. to [[Alcoa]], which merged Howmet into its Alcoa Industrial Components unit.
