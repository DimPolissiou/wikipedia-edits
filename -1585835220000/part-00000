In the 1600s the area around Stanley was part of the estate of [[Earls of Atholl]] and was also the location of [[Inchbervis Castle]]. In 1659 the castle was renamed Stanley House in honour of  the wedding of [[John Murray, 1st Marquess of Atholl]] and Lady Stanley. When the village was built in the 1700s it took the name Stanley after the nearby house.\n\n==History==\n[[John Murray, 4th Duke of Atholl|John Murray, the 4th Duke of Atholl]], decided in the 18th century to harness of the nearby River Tay to power a [[cotton mill]]. [[Richard Arkwright]], an inventor of [[cotton-spinning machinery]] was persuaded by [[George Dempster (lawyer)|George Dempster]] (the local [[Member of Parliament|MP]]), while Dempster was visiting [[Cromford]] in [[Derbyshire]], to come to [[Scotland]] to set up a cotton mill in Stanley as well as one at [[New Lanark]]. Stanley Mills opened in 1787, and by its 10th year employed 350 people.\n\nThe village of Stanley was built to house the workers of the mill. Work on the village began in 1784. It was designed by the Duke of Atholl\u2019s factor [[James Stobie]]. By 1799 the village\u2019s population was around 400, and by 1831 it had reached around 2,000 residents, about 50% of whom worked in the mill.\n\n==Stanley Mill==\nStanley was largely founded to house workers for a huge mill on the banks of the River Tay.\n\nThe mill was originally water-powered but was later converted to steam and finally to electric power. For most of its history it produced cotton thread, but in the 20th century changed to cigarette ribbon.  The Dempster & Co company was established in 1787 by seven men including [[Richard Arkwright]], [[George Dempster (lawyer)|George Dempster]] and [[William Sandeman]] to build the mill on land feued from the Duke of Atholl to provide employment to Highlanders affected by the [[clearances]].<ref>''Perth Entrepreneurs: the Sandemans of Springfield'' by Charles D Waterston, 2008, pages 32\u201333: these pages reference other information sources. {{ISBN|978-0-905452-52-4}}</ref> A fire in 1799 destroyed a large section of the mill and it reopened in 1802, partly with advice from [[David Dale]] of [[New Lanark]] (which it closely resembles).\n\nThe mill used coal gas for lighting until 1921, when this was replaced by a hydroelectric power plant, which was built to also supply electricity to the village.  The power station was closed in 1965 but was reopened in 2003 by [[Npower (United Kingdom)|npower]].\n\nFrom the 1960s the mill was in decline, and it finally closed down in 1989. After that the mill fell derelict. Historic Scotland bought the mill in 1995 and over the next ten years, in liaison with the Phoenix Trust, the buildings renovated and turned into private flats plus a museum depicting life in the 19th century and the story of the mill.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.historic-scotland.gov.uk/propertyresults/propertyabout.htm?PropID=PL_273&PropName=Stanley+Mills|title=Historic Environment Scotland|website=Historic-scotland.gov.uk|accessdate=2 February 2018}}</ref>\n\n==Public transport==\n===Railway===\nA railway station was built in Stanley in 1848. This later evolved into a junction station, as it lay at the point where the branch line to [[Forfar]] broke off from the [[Highland Main Line]]. The Highland Main Line still runs though the village, but the station was closed in 1956.\n\n===Bus===\nA bus service of Stanley-based Allan & Scott used to run the five miles between Stanley and [[Bankfoot]] twice a day on Sundays in the 1930s. The service was taken over in 1946 by A&C McLennan of Spittalfield. Permission to use [[double decker bus]]es was granted in 1950. In 1952, the fare was 5{{half}} [[shilling]]s single and 10 shillings return, with gradual increases to 8 shillings single and one [[Farthing (British coin)|farthing]] return by 1963. By 1966, the service operated only on the first Sunday of each month.

In the 1600s the area around Stanley was part of the estate of [[Earls of Atholl]] and was also the location of [[Inchbervis Castle]]. In 1659 the castle was renamed Stanley House in honour of  the wedding of [[John Murray, 1st Marquess of Atholl]] and Lady Stanley. When the village was built in the 1700s it took the name Stanley after the nearby house.\n\n==History==\n[[John Murray, 4th Duke of Atholl|John Murray, the 4th Duke of Atholl]], decided in the 18th century to harness of the nearby River Tay to power a [[cotton mill]]. [[Richard Arkwright]], an inventor of [[cotton-spinning machinery]] was persuaded by [[George Dempster (lawyer)|George Dempster]] (the local [[Member of Parliament|MP]]), while Dempster was visiting [[Cromford]] in [[Derbyshire]], to come to [[Scotland]] to set up a cotton mill in Stanley as well as one at [[New Lanark]]. Stanley Mills opened in 1787, and by its 10th year employed 350 people.\n\nThe village of Stanley was built to house the workers of the mill. Work on the village began in 1784. It was designed by the Duke of Atholl\u2019s factor [[James Stobie]]. By 1799 the village\u2019s population was around 400, and by 1831 it had reached around 2,000 residents, about 50% of whom worked in the mill.\n\n==Stanley Mill==\nStanley was largely founded to house workers for a huge mill on the banks of the River Tay.\n\nThe mill was originally water-powered but was later converted to steam and finally to electric power. For most of its history it produced cotton thread, but in the 20th century changed to cigarette ribbon.  The Dempster & Co company was established in 1787 by seven men including [[Richard Arkwright]], [[George Dempster (lawyer)|George Dempster]] and [[William Sandeman]] to build the mill on land feued from the Duke of Atholl to provide employment to Highlanders affected by the [[clearances]].<ref>''Perth Entrepreneurs: the Sandemans of Springfield'' by Charles D Waterston, 2008, pages 32\u201333: these pages reference other information sources. {{ISBN|978-0-905452-52-4}}</ref> A fire in 1799 destroyed a large section of the mill and it reopened in 1802, partly with advice from [[David Dale]] of [[New Lanark]] (which it closely resembles).\n\nThe mill used coal gas for lighting until 1921, when this was replaced by a hydroelectric power plant, which was built to also supply electricity to the village.  The power station was closed in 1965 but was reopened in 2003 by [[Npower (United Kingdom)|npower]].\n\nFrom the 1960s the mill was in decline, and it finally closed down in 1989. After that the mill fell derelict. Historic Scotland bought the mill in 1995 and over the next ten years, in liaison with the Phoenix Trust, the buildings renovated and turned into private flats plus a museum depicting life in the 19th century and the story of the mill.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.historic-scotland.gov.uk/propertyresults/propertyabout.htm?PropID=PL_273&PropName=Stanley+Mills|title=Historic Environment Scotland|website=Historic-scotland.gov.uk|accessdate=2 February 2018}}</ref>\n\n==Publis transport==\n===Railway===\nA railway station was built in Stanley in 1848. This later evolved into a junction station, as it lay at the point where the branch line to [[Forfar]] broke off from the [[Highland Main Line]]. The Highland Main Line still runs though the village, but the station was closed in 1956.\n\n===Bus===\nA bus service of Stanley-based Allan & Scott used to run the five miles between Stanley and [[Bankfoot]] twice a day on Sundays in the 1930s. The service was taken over in 1946 by A&C McLennan of Spittalfield. Permission to use [[double decker bus]]es was granted in 1950. In 1952, the fare was 5{{half}} [[shilling]]s single and 10 shillings return, with gradual increases to 8 shillings single and one [[Farthing (British coin)|farthing]] return by 1963. By 1966, the service operated only on the first Sunday of each month. Service was withdrawn in 1967.<ref>''[[The Courier (Dundee)|The Courier]]'', 2 April 2020, p. 28</ref>\n\n==Ballathie House==\n[[Ballathie House]] was built during the 1850s near Stanley.

One-act plays were unfashionable in the 1920s and 30s, but Coward was fond of the genre and conceived the idea of a set of short pieces to be played across several evenings. The actress most closely associated with him was [[Gertrude Lawrence]], and he wrote the ten plays as vehicles for them both.\n\nThe play depicts a leading psychiatrist, falling passionately in love with an old friend of his wife. She has wilfully led him on but is unprepared for the disastrous effect on him. Increasingly desperate, he watches his own mind lose control of itself, and he finally kills himself. The title is taken from ''[[Deuteronomy]]'': \"the Lord shall smite thee with madness and blindness and astonishment of heart\".\n\nThe play was first produced in 1935 in [[Manchester]] and then toured for nine weeks before opening in London (1936) and New York (1936\u201337).

By the 1920s they had gone out of fashion, but Coward was fond of the genre and wrote several early in his career.<ref>Mander and Mitchenson, pp. 25\u201327 and 52</ref> He wrote, \"A short play, having a great advantage over a long one in that it can sustain a mood without technical creaking or over padding, deserves a better fate, and if, by careful writing, acting and producing I can do a little towards reinstating it in its rightful pride, I shall have achieved one of my more sentimental ambitions.\"<ref>''Quoted'' in Morley (2005), p. 66</ref> In 1935 he conceived the idea of a set of short plays, to run in varying permutations on three consecutive nights at the theatre.

Along with Chris's secretary, Susan, and his assistant, Tim, Barbara is waiting for the arrival of Leonora Vail. Sir Reginald French, a surgeon, enters, asking if Leonora has come yet. Barbara asks, \"There isn't much time, is there?\" and he replies that he fears not, and that \"he\" is asking for her in his moments of consciousness. The doorbell rings. Barbara comments \"It's the same \u2013 exactly the same as a year ago ... the first time she ever came into this room\". Ernest, the butler announces Mrs Vail and the lights fade and come up again on the second scene, which is a flashback to November 1934.\n\nBarbara, Tim, Susan and Ernest are all in the same positions, though with minor changes of costume. Leonora, an old school friend of Barbara enters. When Chris looks in for a few moments, his manner to Leonora is vague and uninterested. Leonora tells Barbara that she much prefers his nice assistant, Tim. She leaves, after inviting Barbara, Tim and Chris (\"if he'll come\") to lunch. Tim comes in, looking for a Bible: Chris wants a quotation for his next lecture on psychopathology. They borrow the cook's Bible and find the passage he wants: \"The Lord shall smite thee with madness, and blindness, and astonishment of the heart.\"\n\nIn the third scene, two months later, Chris and Leonora have become considerably more intimate: they are kissing each other passionately. Leonora confesses that she has deliberately tried to make him fall in love, in revenge for his dismissive manner at their first meeting. He  admits that he was deliberately rude to her at first because \"You irritated me, you were so conscious of how beautiful you looked\". He adds that despite his affair with Leonora he loves Barbara \"deeply and truly and for ever\". The scene ends with another passionate clinch.\n\nThree months pass betwee the third and fourth scenes.  It is an early April morning. Barbara has been sitting up all night, waiting for Chris to come home. She greets him calmly but insists on some straight talking. His mental state is affecting his work, she says, and he should go away with Leonore for two or three months, leaving Tim to run the practice. In the fifth scene, in November, Chris and Leonora quarrel bitterly. She says she is leaving him. He throws her to the floor. After she picks herself up and leaves, he drinks two glasses of whisky, goes to the window and jumps out.\n\nThe final scene is a continuation of the first. Ernest announces: \"Mrs Vail.\" Barbara gives her a quick drink and sends her straight into the inner room. The others wait, talking distractedly, until she comes back. Barbara asks, \"Is he \u2013 ?\" Leonora replies, \"Yes ... \"He didn't know me; he thought I was you; he said \u2013 'Baba, I'm not submerged any more' \u2013 and then he said 'Baba' again \u2013 and then \u2013 then he died.\" She leaves the room as the curtain falls.\n:Source: Play text and Mander and Mitchenson.<ref>Coward, pp. 7\u201311 (Scene 1); 11\u201322 (Scene 2); 22\u201327 (Scene 3); 28\u201335 (Scene 4); 36\u201341 (Scene 5) and 41\u201343 (Scene 6); and Mander and Mitchenson, pp. 291\u2013293</ref>\n\n==Critical reception==\n''[[Punch (magazine)|Punch]]'' praised Coward for compressing into \"six brief scenes\" material that \"is still commonly thought to justify three Acts.<ref>Keown, Eric. \"At the Play\", ''Punch'', 22 January 1936, p. 20</ref>  ''[[The Manchester Guardian]]'' thought the plot interesting, the dialogue as lively as ever\" but thought the play as a whole \"suffers from unreality\".<ref>\"To-night at 7.30\", ''The Manchester Guardian'', 16 October 1935, p. 11</ref> ''[[The Observer]]'' described ''The Astonished Heart'' as \"a clever play which probably touched nobody's heart\" \u2026 \"full of good stagecraft and good dialogue [but] power was lacking \u2026 Tragedy and Mr Coward are still far apart\".<ref name=observer>\"3 More Plays by Noel Coward\", ''The Observer'', 20 October 1935, p. 12</ref> ''[[The Times]]'', too, thought that Coward had failed to achieve a true tragedy, \"but the thing is courageous and not frivolous, not written to a popular formula\".<ref>\"The Phoenix Theatre\", ''The Times'', 10 January 1936, p. 10</ref> ''[[Saturday Review (London newspaper)|The Saturday Review]]'' thought it \"a perfect little drama \u2026 sublime\".<ref>\"Theatre Notes\", ''The Saturday Review'', 18 January 1936, p. 95</ref>\n\nWhen ''The Astonished Heart'' was revived in a double-bill with ''[[Still Life (play)|Still Life]]'' in 2004, ''The Guardian's'' critic wrote, \"The astonishing thing is that, stereotypical though they are in many ways, these little plays still have the power to destabilise all your expectations and make your heart turn over.

One-act plays were unfashionable in the 1920s and 30s, but Coward was fond of the genre and conceived the idea of a set of short pieces to be played across several evenings. The actress most closely associated with him was [[Gertrude Lawrence]], and he wrote the ten plays as vehicles for them both.\n\nThe play depicts a leading psychiatrist, falling passionately in love with an old friend of his wife. She has wilfully led him on but is unprepared for the disastrous effect on him. Increasingly desperate, he watches his own mind lose control of itself, and he finally kills himself. The title is taken from ''[[Deuteronomy]]'': \"the Lord shall smite thee with madness and blindness and astonishment of heart\".\n\nThe play was first produced in 1935 in [[Manchester]] and then toured for nine weeks before opening in London (1936) and New York (1936\u201337).

It was the eighth final of the English Twenty20 competition, which was the first domestic Twenty20 competition between [[First-class cricket|first-class]] sides. \n\nHampshire were making their first appearance in a Twenty20 final, while Somerset were playing in their third final and their second in successive years, having previously won the [[2005 Twenty20 Cup|Twenty20 Cup in 2005]]. Somerset chose to bat first and reached 173 for six; [[Craig Kieswetter]] was their highest scorer with 71 runs, but was criticised for his slow start. [[Kieron Pollard]] was hit in the eye by a bouncer, and had to be taken to hospital, meaning he was not subsequently available to bowl for Somerset. In reply, Hampshire reached 62 from the powerplay, but then lost a cluster of wickets. A steadying partnership between [[Neil McKenzie]] and [[Sean Ervine]] took them to the brink of victory, but another pair of wickets led to a tense finish. The match was eventually tied, and Hampshire won the title based on the fact they had lost fewer wickets.\n\n==Background==\nThe [[Twenty20 Cup]] was a 20 overs-per-side competition established in 2003, which replaced the 50 overs-per-side '[[Benson & Hedges Cup]]'.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/cricket/counties/2458345.stm |title=Pure entertainment beckons |publisher=BBC Sport |date=13 November 2002 |last=Brett |first=Oliver |accessdate=18 March 2020}}</ref> [[Hampshire County Cricket Club]] had never reached the final of the competition before,<ref name=\"winners\">{{cite web |url=http://www.espncricinfo.com/england/content/page/312342.html#winners |title=Six appeal |publisher=[[ESPNcricinfo]] |accessdate=18 March 2020}}</ref> but had enjoyed recent success in [[one-day cricket]], having won the [[2009 Friends Provident Trophy]], a 50-over tournament.

Essex bowled well to leave Hampshire needing 42 runs from the final four overs, but aggressive play from [[Sean Ervine]], [[Neil McKenzie]] and [[Michael Carberry]] took Hampshire to a six-wicket victory.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.espncricinfo.com/series/8053/report/435838/hampshire-vs-essex-1st-semi-final-friends-provident-t20-2010 |title=Briggs stars as Hampshire reach the final |last=McGlashan |first=Andrew |work=ESPNcricinfo |date=14 August 2010 |accessdate=18 March 2020}}</ref> Rain delayed the start of the second match, in which Somerset batted first against [[Nottinghamshire County Cricket Club|Nottinghamshire]]. Attacking batting performances from [[Marcus Trescothick]] who scored a 28-ball 60, and [[Jos Buttler]] who made 55 not out from 23 balls, propelled Somerset to 182 runs from their twenty overs. Further rain in between innings meant that Nottinghamshire were chasing a [[Duckworth\u2013Lewis\u2013Stern method|Duckworth-Lewis adjusted]] target of 152 runs from 16 overs. Aware that there was more rain around which might further curtail the match, they played attacking cricket, and remained around their required rate throughout the innings, until the wicket of [[Samit Patel]] at the start of the 13th over. Rain then came in, and the match finished at the end of that over; Somerset won by three runs, using the Duckworth-Lewis method.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.espncricinfo.com/series/8053/report/435839/nottinghamshire-vs-somerset-2nd-semi-final-friends-provident-t20-2010 |title=Trescothick and Buttler lead Somerset to the final |last=McGlashan |first=Andrew |work=ESPNcricinfo |date=14 August 2010 |accessdate=18 March 2020}}</ref>\n\n==Match==\n===Summary===\n[[File:Craig kieswetter batting.jpg|thumb|left|upright|alt=Craig Kieswetter, wearing a maroon Somerset cricket kit, batting|[[Craig Kieswetter]] top-scored for Somerset with 71 runs, but was criticised for his slow start.]]\nPlayed on the same day as both the semi-finals, the match was billed as a [[Day/night cricket|day/night game]], and started at 7:25{{nbsp}}pm. The Somerset captain, Trescothick, won the [[Toss (cricket)|toss]] and elected to bat first.<ref name=\"ciscore\"/> The second of the semi-finals had been shortened due to rain, and leading up to the final, the ''ESPNcricinfo'' commentary described conditions as \"murky\". Kieswetter faced the majority of the early [[Delivery (cricket)|deliveries]]; after three overs, he'd faced 16 of the 19 balls.<ref name=\"inn1\">{{cite web |url=http://www.espncricinfo.com/countycricket2010/engine/match/435840.html?innings=1;view=commentary |title=Friends Provident t20, Final: Hampshire v Somerset at Southampton, Aug 14, 2010: Somerset innings |website=ESPNcricinfo |accessdate=1 June 2017}}</ref> Despite this, Trescothick had the better start; he scored 19 runs from the 8 deliveries he faced.<ref name=\"cireport\">{{cite web |url=http://www.espncricinfo.com/fpt20/content/story/472464.html |title=Hampshire champions after thrilling finish |last=McGlashan |first=Andrew |website=ESPNcricinfo |date=14 August 2010 |accessdate=1 June 2017}}</ref> He struck two [[Boundary (cricket)|boundary sixes]], the first of which, a hard front-foot shot over deep cover, was described as the shot of the day by one observer.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.espncricinfo.com/page2/content/story/472488.html |title=Manic Saturday |last=Aitcheson |first=James |website=ESPNcricinfo |date=14 August 2010 |accessdate=1 June 2017}}</ref> He was dismissed in the fifth over, mishitting a long hop from Abdul Razzaq to Christian fielding at midwicket. Trego joined Kieswetter at the wicket, but the pair struggled on the damp ground. Kieswetter was particularly singled out for criticism during this stage of the match by ''ESPNcricinfo''{{'}}s Andrew McGlashan, who claimed he had a \"stodgy start\".<ref name=\"cireport\"/> Hampshire's young [[Left-arm orthodox spin|left-arm spin bowler]], Briggs, bowled well and had Trego caught at long-off in the twelfth over.<ref name=\"inn1\"/> Trego accumulated 33 runs from 24 balls; Somerset's second highest score of the innings.<ref name=\"ciscore\"/>\n\nAfter Trego's dismissal, Kieswetter began scoring more quickly, hitting 3 fours and 2 sixes to accelerate the innings before both himself and James Hildreth got out in quick succession. Hildreth, who had scored 12 runs, hit a full toss from Razzaq to Christian fielding at gully, and then four balls later, Kieswetter sliced a delivery from Christian to extra cover, where it was caught by Carberry.<ref name=\"inn1\"/> Kieswetter had scored 71 from 59 balls, after taking 37 deliveries to score his first 29 runs.<ref name=\"cireport\"/> The dismissals brought two new batsmen to the crease; Buttler and Pollard. Each faced seven deliveries, but while Buttler could only managed to score five runs before being caught at long-on, Pollard scored a four and 2 sixes.<ref name=\"inn1\"/> With three balls of the innings remaining, Pollard was surprised by a [[Bouncer (cricket)|bouncer]] from Cork which got in through the gap in his helmet grille and struck him in the eye.<ref name=\"cireport\"/> Pollard's eye was swollen shut, and he had to [[Not out|retire injured]] from the match and be taken to hospital.<ref name=\"critics\">{{cite web |url=http://www.espncricinfo.com/fpt20/content/story/472511.html |title=Dominic Cork says win proves critics wrong |last=McGlashan |first=Andrew |website=ESPNcricinfo |date=15 August 2010 |accessdate=1 June 2017}}</ref> Cork, who was shaken by the incident, dismissed Suppiah with the penultimate ball of the innings, and then prevented any runs from the final ball.

At the start of the next over, Vince was run out without scoring, and Hampshire were 62 for two. Adams and the new batsman, McKenzie, added 22 runs in the next three overs, before Adams got an inside edge to a delivery from Suppiah, and was bowled. With the score on 84 for three, Ervine joined McKenzie at the crease, and the pair played what McGlashan described as \"smart, risk-free batting\"; they shared a partnership of 79, moving the score onto 163.<ref name=\"cireport\"/> At the start of the penultimate over, Hampshire needed eleven runs to win.

Kieswetter twice threw at the stumps, aiming to run the batsmen out, but missed both times.<ref name=\"cireport\"/> Hampshire needed four to win from the final two deliveries, but by virtue of losing fewer wickets, they would also claim the title in the event of a tied match, so three runs would suffice.<ref name=\"guardasit\"/> From the penultimate delivery, Christian hit the ball to deep mid-wicket for two runs, but while running he pulled his hamstring. Christian was on strike for the final delivery, and another Hampshire player had come out to act as a runner for him. Christian missed the ball, which struck his pads. Somerset appealed for [[leg before wicket]], and the Hampshire batsmen ran a single. In the confusion and excitement, Christian himself ran, as well as his runner, meaning that he could have been run out. However, Somerset were distracted with their appeal, and did not notice.
