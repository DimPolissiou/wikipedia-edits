The resulting [[European debt crisis|European sovereign-debt crisis]] became more pronounced early in the decade and continued to affect the possibility of a global economic recovery. Economic issues, such as austerity, inflation, and an increase in [[commodity]] prices, led to unrest in many countries, including the [[Anti-austerity movement in Spain|15-M]] and [[Occupy movement]]s. Unrest in some countries \u2013 particularly in the [[Arab world]] \u2013 evolved into [[socioeconomic]] crises triggering revolutions in [[Tunisian Revolution|Tunisia]], [[2011 Egyptian revolution|Egypt]], and [[Bahraini uprising (2011\u2013present)|Bahrain]] as well as civil wars in [[2011 Libyan Civil War|Libya]], [[Syrian Civil War|Syria]], and [[Yemeni Civil War (2015\u2013present)|Yemen]] in a widespread phenomenon commonly referred to as the [[Arab Spring]]. Shifting social attitudes saw [[LGBT rights by country or territory|LGBT rights]] and [[Women in government|female representation]] make substantial progress during the decade, particularly in the West and parts of Asia and Africa.\n\n<!-- Politics and conflicts -->\nThe [[United States]] continued to retain its [[Superpower|global superpower]] status while an [[Chinese Dream|assertive]] [[China]], along with launching vast [[Belt and Road Initiative|economic initiatives]] and [[2015 People's Republic of China military reform|military reforms]], sought to expand its [[South China Sea#Territorial claims|influence]] in the [[South China Sea]] and in [[Africa\u2013China relations|Africa]], solidifying its position as a [[Potential superpowers#China|potential superpower]]; global competition between China and the U.S. coalesced into a \"[[China containment policy|containment]]\" effort and a [[China\u2013United States trade war|trade war]]. Elsewhere in Asia, the [[Korea]]s [[2018\u201319 Korean peace process|improved their relations]] after a [[2017\u201318 North Korea crisis|prolonged crisis]] and the [[War on Terror]] continued as [[Osama bin Laden]] was [[Death of Osama bin Laden|assassinated]] by U.S. forces in a raid on his [[Osama bin Laden's compound in Abbottabad|compound]] in [[Pakistan]] as a part of the U.S.'s continued [[Foreign interventions by the United States|military involvement]] in many parts of the world. The rise of the [[Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant]] extremist organization in 2014 [[ISIL territorial claims|erased]] the borders between Syria and Iraq, resulting in a [[International military intervention against ISIL|multinational intervention]] that also saw the [[Barisha raid|demise]] of its leader. In Africa, [[South Sudan]] [[2011 South Sudanese independence referendum|broke away]] from [[Sudan]] and [[2018\u201319 Arab protests|mass protests]] and various coups d'\u00e9tat saw longtime strongmen deposed. Meanwhile, the [[European Union]] experienced a [[European migrant crisis|migrant crisis]] and historic United Kingdom [[Brexit]] referendum, and Russia [[Annexation of Crimea by the Russian Federation|annexed Crimea]].\n\n<!-- Internet and privacy -->\nInformation technology progressed, with [[smartphone]]s becoming widespread. The [[Internet of things]] saw substantial growth during the 2010s due to advancements in wireless networking devices, mobile telephony, and [[cloud computing]]. Advancements in [[data processing]] and the rollout of [[4G|4G broadband]] allowed [[Big data|data]] and information to disperse among domains at paces never before seen while online resources such as [[social media]] facilitated phenomena such as the [[Me Too movement]] and the rise of [[slacktivism]] and online [[call-out culture]]. Online nonprofit organization [[WikiLeaks]] gained international attention for publishing classified information on topics including [[Guantanamo Bay files leak|Guant\u00e1namo Bay]], [[Syria Files|Syria]], the [[Afghan War documents leak|Afghan]] and [[Iraq War documents leak|Iraq]] wars, and [[United States diplomatic cables leak|United States diplomacy]]. [[Edward Snowden]] blew the whistle on [[Global surveillance disclosures (2013\u2013present)|global surveillance]], raising awareness on the role governments and private entities have in [[mass surveillance]] and [[information privacy]].\n\n<!-- Climate change and natural disasters -->\nGlobal warming became increasingly noticeable through [[Global temperature record|new record temperatures in different years]] and [[Effects of global warming|extreme weather events on all continents]]. The [[Carbon dioxide in Earth's atmosphere|CO<sub>2</sub> concentration rose from 390 to 410 PPM]] over the decade. At the same time, combating pollution and climate change continued to be major concerns, as concerns as protests, initiatives, and legislation garnered substantial media attention. Particularly, the [[Paris Agreement]] (2015) was adopted and a [[School strike for the climate|global climate youth movement]] was formed. Major natural disasters included the [[2010 Haiti earthquake]], the [[2011 T\u014dhoku earthquake and tsunami]], the [[April 2015 Nepal earthquake|Nepal earthquake]] of 2015, the [[2018 Sulawesi earthquake and tsunami]], and the devastating hurricanes [[Hurricane Harvey|Harvey]], [[Hurricane Irma|Irma]], [[Hurricane Maria|Maria]], [[Typhoon Haiyan|Haiyan]] (Yolanda), [[Hurricane Sandy|Sandy]], and [[Hurricane Dorian|Dorian]].\n\n<!-- Entertainment industry -->\n[[Superhero film]]s became box office leaders, with ''[[Avengers: Endgame]]'' becoming the [[List of highest-grossing films|highest-grossing film of all time]], grossing [[List of box office records set by Avengers: Endgame|over $2.7 billion worldwide]]. [[Cable television|Cable providers]] saw a decline in subscriber numbers as [[Cord-cutting|cord cutters]] switched to lower cost [[online streaming]] services such as [[Netflix]], [[Amazon Prime Video|Amazon Prime]] and [[Hulu]]. Globalism and an increased demand for variety and personalization in the face of [[music streaming service]]s such as [[Spotify]] created many subgenres. Dance, hip-hop, and pop music surged into the 2010s, with [[Electronic dance music|EDM]] achieving mass commercial success. Digital music sales topped CD sales in 2012. The video game industry continued to be dominated by [[Nintendo]], [[Sony]], and [[Microsoft]]; ''[[Minecraft]]'' became the [[List of best-selling video games|best-selling game]] of all time.\n{{TOC limit|limit=3}}\n\n==Politics and conflicts==\n{{Main|2010s political history}}\n\n===Major conflicts===\n{{Main|List of wars: 2003\u2013present}}\nThe prominent wars of the decade include:\n\n====International wars====\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable mw-collapsible mw-collapsed\"\n! style=\"width:130px;\"| Name\n! style=\"width:110px;\"| Start date\n! style=\"width:110px;\"| End date\n!

was increasingly called a [[superpower]] in the early 2010s, including at the 2011 meeting between President [[Hu Jintao]] and United States President [[Barack Obama]]. China overtook the U.S. as the world's largest trading nation, filing the [[World Intellectual Property Indicators|most patents]], expanding its [[List of countries by level of military equipment|military]], landing its lunar rover ''[[Yutu (rover)|Yutu]]'' on the moon (ending a four-decade lack of lunar exploration) and creating China's [[Oriental Movie Metropolis]] as a major film and cultural center.

Russia also flexed its [[power projection]] capabilities, particularly demonstrated during the 2014 [[Annexation of Crimea by the Russian Federation|annexation]] of [[Crimea]] and its interventions in [[Russian military intervention in Ukraine (2014-present)|eastern Ukraine]] and the [[Russian military intervention in the Syrian Civil War|Syrian Civil War]]; [[Wagner Group]] had a significant presence in both conflicts. Russia also notably waged [[information warfare]] campaigns against its geopolitical foes, including [[Russian interference in the 2016 United States elections|interfering]] in the 2016 U.S. elections via [[2016 Democratic National Committee email leak|hacking and leaking emails]] of U.S. political party leadership and by spreading disinformation via the [[Internet Research Agency]]. Other alleged Russian intelligence operations included the [[Poisoning of Sergei and Yulia Skripal|Skripal poisonings]] and the [[Montenegrin coup plot]], both of which were attributed by some to the [[Unit 29155]] organization. Collectively, these activities\u2014and the Western-led efforts to combat the influence of Russian [[Russian oligarch|oligarchs]] and political interests\u2014have been referred to as the [[Second Cold War]].\n\nThe [[European Union]] went through several crises. The [[European debt crisis]] caused severe economic problems to several [[eurozone]] member states, most severely [[Greece]]. The [[European migrant crisis|2015 migration crisis]] led to several million people entering the EU illegally in a short period of time. There was a significant rise in the vote shares of several [[eurosceptic]] parties, including the [[Lega Nord|League]] in Italy, [[Alternative for Germany]], and the [[Finns Party]] in [[Finland]]. As a result of a [[referendum]], the [[United Kingdom]] became the first member state in the EU's history to initiate proceedings for [[Brexit|leaving the Union]].\n\n====Polarization====\nSocio-political polarization increased as conservatives and social liberals clashed over the role and size of government and other social, economic and environmental issues in the [[Western world|West]].

In Europe, [[pasokification]] described the loss of vote share experienced by traditional [[center-left]] or [[social democratic]] parties. In France, specifically, the collapse of traditional parties was especially notable, with [[Emmanuel Macron]]'s ''[[La R\u00e9publique En Marche!]]'' winning a majority in its first election in 2017.\n\n[[Center-left]] and traditional [[social democratic]] parties often lost their vote share to more [[socialist]] or [[democratic socialist]] alternatives, especially in [[Europe]]. This happened most completely in [[Greece]], where [[PASOK]] was replaced by [[Syriza]] as the main left-wing party. Other [[far-left]] parties which rose in prominence included [[Podemos (Spanish political party)|Podemos]] in [[Spain]] and [[La France Insoumise]] in [[France]]. In the [[two-party system]]s of the [[English-speaking world]], these challenges mainly came from within the established parties of the left, with [[Bernie Sanders]] in the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]] and [[Jeremy Corbyn]] in the [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]] pushing for more left-wing policies.\n\nThe political establishment was also challenged in many countries by protest movements, often organised through new [[social media]] platforms. These included the various [[Arab Spring]] protests, the [[Occupy movement]], and the [[yellow vests movement]]. For a comprehensive list, see [[list of protests in the 21st century]].\n\n====Democracy and authoritarianism====\nCountries which [[Democratization|democratized]] fully or partially during the decade included [[Angola]], which reformed under [[Jo\u00e3o Louren\u00e7o]];<ref name=\"freedom2019\">{{cite web |title=Freedom in the World 2019 |url=https://freedomhouse.org/report/freedom-world/freedom-world-2019/democracy-in-retreat |publisher=Freedom House}}</ref> [[Armenia]], which went through [[2018 Armenian revolution|a revolution]];<ref name=\"freedom2019\" /><ref name=\"wpost\">{{cite web |title=Three countries where democracy actually staged a comeback in 2018 |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2018/12/17/three-countries-where-democracy-actually-staged-comeback/ |work=Washington Post}}</ref> [[Ecuador]], which reformed under [[Len\u00edn Moreno]];<ref name=\"freedom2019\" /> [[Ethiopia]];<ref name=\"freedom2019\" /><ref name=\"wpost\"/> and [[Malaysia]], where the ruling party [[2018 Malaysian general election|lost the first election]] since independence.<ref name=\"freedom2019\" /><ref>{{cite web |title=Did an election just cause Malaysian democratisation? |url=https://www.lowyinstitute.org/the-interpreter/did-election-just-cause-malaysian-democratisation |publisher=The Lowy Institute}}</ref>\n\nLong-term [[dictator]]s ousted from power included [[Muammar Gaddafi]] of [[Libya]] (after 42 years),<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.aljazeera.com/programmes/the-big-picture/2018/11/death-gaddafi-181103124656506.html|title=The Death of Gaddafi|website=www.aljazeera.com|access-date=20 November 2019}}</ref> [[Robert Mugabe]] of [[Zimbabwe]] (37 years),<ref>{{cite journal |title=Zimbabwe's army mounts a coup against Robert Mugabe |url=https://www.economist.com/middle-east-and-africa/2017/11/15/zimbabwes-army-mounts-a-coup-against-robert-mugabe |journal=The Economist|date=15 November 2017 }}</ref> [[Ali Abdullah Saleh]] of [[Yemen]] (33 years),<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-middle-east-17177720|title=Yemen president Saleh steps down|date=27 February 2012|access-date=20 November 2019|language=en-GB}}</ref> [[Omar al-Bashir]] of [[Sudan]] (30 years),<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2019/04/profile-omar-al-bashir-sudan-longtime-ruler-190411083628141.html|title=Profile: Omar al-Bashir, Sudan's longtime ruler|website=www.aljazeera.com|access-date=20 November 2019}}</ref> [[Hosni Mubarak]] of [[Egypt]] (29 years),<ref>{{cite news |title=Profile: Hosni Mubarak |url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-middle-east-12301713 |publisher=BBC|work=BBC News |date=24 March 2017 }}</ref> and [[Zine El Abidine Ben Ali|Ben Ali]] of [[Tunisia]] (23 years).<ref>{{cite news |title=Ben Ali: Tunisia's ousted ex-president dies in exile aged 83 |url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-africa-49752876 |publisher=BBC|work=BBC News |date=19 September 2019 }}</ref>\n\n[[Democratic backsliding]] occurred in countries such as [[Hungary]],<ref>{{cite web |title=As West Fears the Rise of Autocrats, Hungary Shows What's Possible |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2018/02/10/world/europe/hungary-orban-democracy-far-right.html |work=New York Times}}</ref> [[Venezuela]],<ref>{{cite journal |title=The Final Blow to Venezuela's Democracy |url=https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/venezuela/2016-11-01/final-blow-venezuelas-democracy |journal=Foreign Affairs|date=14 August 2019 }}</ref> and [[Turkey]].<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Tansel |first1=Cemal Burak |title=Authoritarian Neoliberalism and Democratic Backsliding in Turkey: Beyond the Narratives of Progress |journal=South European Society and Politics |date=2018 |volume=23 |issue=2 |pages=197\u2013217|doi=10.1080/13608746.2018.1479945 }}</ref>\n\nThe [[Arab Winter]] refers to the resurgence of [[authoritarianism]], [[Absolute monarchy|absolute monarchies]] and [[Islamic extremism]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://bpr.berkeley.edu/2015/03/30/after-every-winter-comes-spring-tunisias-democratic-flowering/|title=After Every Winter Comes Spring: Tunisia's Democratic Flowering \u2013 Berkeley Political Review|author=Yun Ru Phua|date=|publisher=Bpr.berkeley.edu|accessdate=2017-02-11}}</ref> evolving in the aftermath of the Arab Spring protests in [[Arab World|Arab countries]].<ref>Ahmed H Adam and Ashley D Robinson.

The resulting [[European debt crisis|European sovereign-debt crisis]] became more pronounced early in the decade and continued to affect the possibility of a global economic recovery. Economic issues, such as austerity, inflation, and an increase in [[commodity]] prices, led to unrest in many countries, including the [[Anti-austerity movement in Spain|15-M]] and [[Occupy movement]]s. Unrest in some countries \u2013 particularly in the [[Arab world]] \u2013 evolved into [[socioeconomic]] crises triggering revolutions in [[Tunisian Revolution|Tunisia]], [[2011 Egyptian revolution|Egypt]], and [[Bahraini uprising (2011\u2013present)|Bahrain]] as well as civil wars in [[2011 Libyan Civil War|Libya]], [[Syrian Civil War|Syria]], and [[Yemeni Civil War (2015\u2013present)|Yemen]] in a widespread phenomenon commonly referred to as the [[Arab Spring]]. Shifting social attitudes saw [[LGBT rights by country or territory|LGBT rights]] and [[Women in government|female representation]] make substantial progress during the decade, particularly in the West and parts of Asia and Africa.\n\n<!-- Politics and conflicts -->\nThe [[United States]] continued to retain its [[Superpower|global superpower]] status while an [[Chinese Dream|assertive]] [[China]], along with launching vast [[Belt and Road Initiative|economic initiatives]] and [[2015 People's Republic of China military reform|military reforms]], sought to expand its [[South China Sea#Territorial claims|influence]] in the [[South China Sea]] and in [[Africa\u2013China relations|Africa]], solidifying its position as a [[Potential superpowers#China|potential superpower]]; global competition between China and the U.S. coalesced into a \"[[China containment policy|containment]]\" effort and a [[China\u2013United States trade war|trade war]]. Elsewhere in Asia, the [[Korea]]s [[2018\u201319 Korean peace process|improved their relations]] after a [[2017\u201318 North Korea crisis|prolonged crisis]] and the [[War on Terror]] continued as [[Osama bin Laden]] was [[Death of Osama bin Laden|assassinated]] by U.S. forces in a raid on his [[Osama bin Laden's compound in Abbottabad|compound]] in [[Pakistan]] as a part of the U.S.'s continued [[Foreign interventions by the United States|military involvement]] in many parts of the world. The rise of the [[Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant]] extremist organization in 2014 [[ISIL territorial claims|erased]] the borders between Syria and Iraq, resulting in a [[International military intervention against ISIL|multinational intervention]] that also saw the [[Barisha raid|demise]] of its leader. In Africa, [[South Sudan]] [[2011 South Sudanese independence referendum|broke away]] from [[Sudan]] and [[2018\u201319 Arab protests|mass protests]] and various coups d'\u00e9tat saw longtime strongmen deposed. Meanwhile, the [[European Union]] experienced a [[European migrant crisis|migrant crisis]] and historic United Kingdom [[Brexit]] referendum, and Russia [[Annexation of Crimea by the Russian Federation|annexed Crimea]].\n\n<!-- Internet and privacy -->\nInformation technology progressed, with [[smartphone]]s becoming widespread. The [[Internet of things]] saw substantial growth during the 2010s due to advancements in wireless networking devices, mobile telephony, and [[cloud computing]]. Advancements in [[data processing]] and the rollout of [[4G|4G broadband]] allowed [[Big data|data]] and information to disperse among domains at paces never before seen while online resources such as [[social media]] facilitated phenomena such as the [[Me Too movement]] and the rise of [[slacktivism]] and online [[call-out culture]]. Online nonprofit organization [[WikiLeaks]] gained international attention for publishing classified information on topics including [[Guantanamo Bay files leak|Guant\u00e1namo Bay]], [[Syria Files|Syria]], the [[Afghan War documents leak|Afghan]] and [[Iraq War documents leak|Iraq]] wars, and [[United States diplomatic cables leak|United States diplomacy]]. [[Edward Snowden]] blew the whistle on [[Global surveillance disclosures (2013\u2013present)|global surveillance]], raising awareness on the role governments and private entities have in [[mass surveillance]] and [[information privacy]].\n\n<!-- Climate change and natural disasters -->\nGlobal warming became increasingly noticeable through [[Global temperature record|new record temperatures in different years]] and [[Effects of global warming|extreme weather events on all continents]]. The [[Carbon dioxide in Earth's atmosphere|CO<sub>2</sub> concentration rose from 390 to 410 PPM]] over the decade. At the same time, combating pollution and climate change continued to be major concerns, as concerns as protests, initiatives, and legislation garnered substantial media attention. Particularly, the [[Paris Agreement]] (2015) was adopted and a [[School strike for the climate|global climate youth movement]] was formed. Major natural disasters included the [[2010 Haiti earthquake]], the [[2011 T\u014dhoku earthquake and tsunami]], the [[April 2015 Nepal earthquake|Nepal earthquake]] of 2015, the [[2018 Sulawesi earthquake and tsunami]], and the devastating hurricanes [[Hurricane Harvey|Harvey]], [[Hurricane Irma|Irma]], [[Hurricane Maria|Maria]], [[Typhoon Haiyan|Haiyan]] (Yolanda), [[Hurricane Sandy|Sandy]], and [[Hurricane Dorian|Dorian]].\n\n<!-- Entertainment industry -->\n[[Superhero film]]s became box office leaders, with ''[[Avengers: Endgame]]'' becoming the [[List of highest-grossing films|highest-grossing film of all time]], grossing [[List of box office records set by Avengers: Endgame|over $2.7 billion worldwide]]. [[Cable television|Cable providers]] saw a decline in subscriber numbers as [[Cord-cutting|cord cutters]] switched to lower cost [[online streaming]] services such as [[Netflix]], [[Amazon Prime Video|Amazon Prime]] and [[Hulu]]. Globalism and an increased demand for variety and personalization in the face of [[music streaming service]]s such as [[Spotify]] created many subgenres. Dance, hip-hop, and pop music surged into the 2010s, with [[Electronic dance music|EDM]] achieving mass commercial success. Digital music sales topped CD sales in 2012. The video game industry continued to be dominated by [[Nintendo]], [[Sony]], and [[Microsoft]]; ''[[Minecraft]]'' became the [[List of best-selling video games|best-selling game]] of all time.\n{{TOC limit|limit=3}}\n\n==Politics and conflicts==\n{{Main|2010s political history}}\n\n===Major conflicts===\n{{Main|List of wars: 2003\u2013present}}\nThe prominent wars of the decade include:\n\n====International wars====\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable mw-collapsible mw-collapsed\"\n! style=\"width:130px;\"| Name\n! style=\"width:110px;\"| Start date\n! style=\"width:110px;\"| End date\n!

was increasingly called a [[superpower]] in the early 2010s, including at the 2011 meeting between President [[Hu Jintao]] and United States President [[Barack Obama]]. China overtook the U.S. as the world's largest trading nation, filing the [[World Intellectual Property Indicators|most patents]], expanding its [[List of countries by level of military equipment|military]], landing its lunar rover ''[[Yutu (rover)|Yutu]]'' on the moon (ending a four-decade lack of lunar exploration) and creating China's [[Oriental Movie Metropolis]] as a major film and cultural center. China was projected to have the world's largest economy by 2018 with an estimated [[GDP per capita]] equal to the U.S. by the late 2050s.<ref>[http://uk.news.yahoo.com/5/20110119/twl-superpower-talks-china-faces-tough-u-3fd0ae9.html] {{dead link|date=June 2016|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}</ref> In 2018, [[List of countries by military expenditures|global military spending]] reached the highest it has been since 1988, late [[Cold War]] levels, largely fueled by increased [[Military budget|defense spending]] by China and the United States, whose budgets together accounted for half of the world's total military spending.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.trust.org/item/20190429105059-m8xz0|title=Global military spending at new post-Cold War high, fueled by US, China \u2013 think-tank|date=29 April 2019|work=Reuters}}</ref> In 2019, the [[Lowy Institute|Lowy Institute Asia Power Index]], which measures the projections of power in the Indo-Pacific, called both China and the United States the superpowers of the 21st century, citing immense influence in almost all eight indexes of power.<ref>{{Cite website|title=Lowy Institute Asia Power Index: China 2019|url=https://power.lowyinstitute.org/countries.php?profile=CN]]}}</ref><ref>{{Cite website|title=Lowy Institute Asia Power Index: United States 2019|url=https://power.lowyinstitute.org/countries.php?profile=US]]}}</ref>\n\nAlong with China, a [[Russia under Vladimir Putin|Vladimir Putin-led]] [[Russia]] also steadily increased its defense spending and continued to [[2008 Russian military reform|modernize]] its military capabilities throughout the decade, including the development of the [[T-14 Armata]] main battle tank and the fifth-generation [[Sukhoi Su-57]] jet fighter. Russia also flexed its [[power projection]] capabilities, particularly demonstrated during the 2014 [[Annexation of Crimea by the Russian Federation|annexation]] of [[Crimea]] and its interventions in [[Russian military intervention in Ukraine (2014-present)|eastern Ukraine]] and the [[Russian military intervention in the Syrian Civil War|Syrian Civil War]]; [[Wagner Group]] had a significant presence in both conflicts. Russia also notably waged [[information warfare]] campaigns against its geopolitical foes, including [[Russian interference in the 2016 United States elections|interfering]] in the 2016 U.S. elections via [[2016 Democratic National Committee email leak|hacking and leaking emails]] of U.S. political party leadership and by spreading disinformation via the [[Internet Research Agency]]. Other alleged Russian intelligence operations included the [[Poisoning of Sergei and Yulia Skripal|Skripal poisonings]] and the [[Montenegrin coup plot]], both of which were attributed by some to the [[Unit 29155]] organization. Collectively, these activities\u2014and the Western-led efforts to combat the influence of Russian [[Russian oligarch|oligarchs]] and political interests\u2014have been referred to as the [[Second Cold War]].\n\nThe [[European Union]] went through several crises. The [[European debt crisis]] caused severe economic problems to several [[eurozone]] member states, most severely [[Greece]]. The [[European migrant crisis|2015 migration crisis]] led to several million people entering the EU illegally in a short period of time. There was a significant rise in the vote shares of several [[eurosceptic]] parties, including the [[Lega Nord|League]] in Italy, [[Alternative for Germany]], and the [[Finns Party]] in [[Finland]]. As a result of a [[referendum]], the [[United Kingdom]] became the first member state in the EU's history to initiate proceedings for [[Brexit|leaving the Union]].\n\n====Polarization====\nSocio-political polarization increased as conservatives and social liberals clashed over the role and size of government and other social, economic and environmental issues in the [[Western world|West]].

In Europe, [[pasokification]] described the loss of vote share experienced by traditional [[center-left]] or [[social democratic]] parties. In France, specifically, the collapse of traditional parties was especially notable, with [[Emmanuel Macron]]'s ''[[La R\u00e9publique En Marche!]]'' winning a majority in its first election in 2017.\n\n[[Center-left]] and traditional [[social democratic]] parties often lost their vote share to more [[socialist]] or [[democratic socialist]] alternatives, especially in [[Europe]]. This happened most completely in [[Greece]], where [[PASOK]] was replaced by [[Syriza]] as the main left-wing party. Other [[far-left]] parties which rose in prominence included [[Podemos (Spanish political party)|Podemos]] in [[Spain]] and [[La France Insoumise]] in [[France]].

It has also been used to denote a chief or leader of a tribe or group. It is used as a Persian synonym of the Arabic title ''[[Emir]]''.\n\nThe term and its cognates originate from [[Persian language|Persian]] ''sard\u0101r'' ({{lang|fa|[[wikt:\u0633\u0631\u062f\u0627\u0631|\u0633\u0631\u062f\u0627\u0631]]}}) and have been historically used across [[Islamic Persia|Persia]] ([[Iran]]), [[Ottoman Empire]] and [[Turkey]] (as \"[[Serdar (Ottoman rank)|Serdar]]\"), [[Mesopotamia]] (now [[Iraq]]), [[Syria]], [[South Asia]] ([[Pakistan]], [[India]], [[Bangladesh]] and [[Nepal]]), the [[Caucasus]], [[Central Asia]], the [[Balkans]] and [[Egypt]] (as \"[[Sirdar]]\").<ref name=EB1911>{{cite EB1911 |wstitle=Sirdar |volume=25 |page=154}}</ref>\n\nThe term was widely used by [[Maratha]] nobility, who held important positions in various [[List of Maratha dynasties and states|Maratha States]] of the imperial [[Maratha Empire]].\n\nAfter the decline of [[feudalism]], ''Sardar'' later indicated a [[Head of State]], a [[Commander-in-chief]], and an Army [[military rank]]. As a military rank, a ''Sardar'' typically marked the [[Commander-in-Chief]] or the highest-ranking [[military officer]] in an Army, akin to the modern [[Field Marshal]], [[General of the Army]] or [[Chief of Army (disambiguation)|Chief of Army]]. The more administrative title ''Sirdar-Bahadur'' denoted a [[Governor-General]] or [[Chief Minister]] of a remote province, akin to a British [[Viceroy]].\n\nIn [[Himalayas|Himalayan]] [[mountaineering]], a ''Sirdar'' is a local leader of the [[Sherpa people|Sherpas]].<ref>{{cite book | last = Sayre  | first = Woodrow Wilson | title = Four Against Everest  | url = https://archive.org/details/fouragainstevere00sayr  | url-access = registration  | publisher = Prentice-Hall | year = 1964  | location = Englewood Cliffs, NJ, USA  | id = Library of Congress Catalog Card No: 64-15208  | page = [https://archive.org/details/fouragainstevere00sayr/page/223 223] }}</ref> Among other duties, he records the heights reached by the individual Sherpas, which factors into their compensation.

For example, the king of [[Kapurthala]] used the title of Sardar.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://members.iinet.net.au/~royalty/ips/k/kapurthala.html|title=Royal Kapurthala Dynasty History}}</ref>\n\n==Noblemen==\n* In [[Balochistan (region)|Baluchistan]], the title ''Sardar'' marked the chief of his tribe.\n* In the [[Emirate of Afghanistan|Royal Afghan Kingdom]], the original ''Nishan-i-Sardari'' (Order of the Leader), founded by [[Am\u0101null\u0101h Kh\u0101n|King Amanullah]] in 1923, was bestowed for exceptional service to the Crown by the Afghan monarch. Recipients enjoyed the titles of ''Sardar-i-Ala'' or ''Sardar-i-Ali'' before their names and also received grants of land. The original Order was disbanded in 1929, and was later revived by [[Mohammed Zahir Shah|King Muhammad Zahir Shah]].\n* In [[Ottoman Turkey]], Serdar was a rank in Montenegro and Serbia. Serdar was also used in the [[Principality of Montenegro]] and the [[Principality of Serbia]] as an honorary \"title\" below that of [[Voivode|Vojvoda]]. For example, [[Janko Vukoti\u0107]] who was a military leader and former prime minister of Montenegro with title of ''Serdar''. However, this were not noble titles as there was no nobility in Serbia and Montenegro and no hereditary titles apart from those borne by members of the reigning families of both countries.\n* In [[Persia]], ''Sardar-i-Bozorg'' was the title of both [[Hossein Khan Sardar]] and his brother Hasan Khan Qajar. Both were uncles of [[Mohammad Khan Qajar|Agha Khan Qajar]], the King-Emperor of Persia and the Commander-in-chief under Emperor [[Fat\u2032h-Ali Shah Qajar]] in the [[Russo-Persian War (1804\u20131813)|Russo-Persian Wars of 1804]] and [[Russo-Persian War (1826\u20131828)|1826]].\n* The early [[feudal]] [[Maratha Empire]] prior to [[Peshwa]] administration (1674\u20131749) used the title ''Sardar'' to identify an imperial court [[Minister (government)|minister]] with military and diplomatic functions. If granted land (''[[jagir]]''), the title ''Sardar'' also marked a [[feudal superior]] responsible for administration, defense and taxing of the granted territory (equivalent to the European title [[Count]], from the French ''comte'' meaning the \"companion\" or delegate to the [[Emperor]] that administered a [[county]]). These ''Sardars'' of the early [[Maratha Empire]] were [[life peers]]; the title was not hereditary.\n* If the ''Sardar'' was appointed to [[Commander-in-Chief]] of all [[Maratha]] forces, the style ''[[Senapati]]'' was used in combination (e.g., ''Sardar Senapati'' or ''Sarsenapati'' Khanderao Yesajirao [[Dabhade]]. The title [[Senapati]] is a [[primogeniture]] hereditary title, as is evidenced by the current ''[[Senapati]]'' Shrimant Sardar Padmasenraje [[Dabhade]] of [[Talegaon Dabhade]].\n* In the [[Maratha Empire]], the more administrative role of ''Sirdar-Bahadur'' denoted a [[Governor General]] or [[Chief Minister]] of a remote [[province]]; this best equates to a [[Mughal Empire|Mughal]] ''[[Subahdar]]'' or British [[Viceroy]] in function and rank.\n* The title ''Sirdar'' was used by Englishmen to describe native noblemen in [[British India]] (e.g., ''Sirdars'' of the [[Deccan Plateau|Deccan]]).\n\n==Aristocrats==\n* In the [[Hazara Division]] of Pakistan, the word ''Sardar'' is used by the [[Karlal]] tribe before their names, traditionally, to stress their upper-caste status, e.g., ''Sardar'' Muhammad Aslam, ''Sardar'' Haider Zaman etc.\n*In the small district of [[Sudhanoti]], [[Kashmir]], ''Sardar'' is used by the hybrid [[Sudhan]] tribe to refer to their putative part-descent from the [[Sadduzai]] clan of King [[Ahmad Shah Durrani]].  Also, Poonch families in this region use ''Sardar'' at the beginning of their names.\n* Similarly ''Sardar'' is used by [[Khattar (tribe)|Khattar]] tribe noble men, native to the districts of [[Attock]] and adjacent areas of [[Rawalpindi]]. \n*''Sardar'' was used for important political, tribal, military and religious officers rankings by the [[Sikh]]s during the period of Maharaja [[Ranjit Singh]] and this title was borrowed from Muslims.\n\n==Head of state==\n* In Persian, ''Sardar i-Azam'' was occasionally used as an alternative title for the [[Shahanshah]]'s Head of government, normally styled ''[[Vazir i-Azam]]'', notably in 1904-06 for a [[Qajar dynasty|Qajar]] prince, Prince [[Major General]] [[Abdol Majid Mirza]].\n* [[Vallabhbhai Patel]], the first Deputy Prime Minister of India was referred to as Sardar Patel; he is also now known as the \"Iron Man of India\".\n* ''Sadr-e-Riyasat'' was the title of one Constitutional [[Head of State]] of the princely state of [[Kashmir]], Yuvaraj Shri Karan Singhji Bahadur, who was appointed as Heir Apparent in 1931. After his father had acceded to India, ending the sovereign Monarchy, Regent in 1949 to 1956. ''Sardar-i-Riyasat'' 1956 to 1965 (succeeded on the death of his father as Maharaja of Jammu and Kashmir, 1961, no longer carrying any hereditary power), next Governor of the Indian constitutive State of [[Jammu and Kashmir]] 1965 to 1967.\n* [[Saparmurat Niyazov]], the authoritarian ruler of [[Turkmenistan]] in 1990\u20142006, carried a few glorifying titles, one of which was ''Serdar'' (\u201cLeader\u201d).<ref>{{cite book|last=Cummings|first=Sally N.|date=2010|title= Symbolism and Power in Central Asia: Politics of the Spectacular|url=|location=Milton, United Kingdom|publisher=Routledge|pages=91-92|isbn= 978-0415575676}}</ref>\n\n==Military title==\n[[File:A Sikh sardar.jpg|right|thumb|A Sikh sardar]]\n[[File:Bhakti Thapa Sardar.jpg|thumb|[[Bhakti Thapa]] - a [[Gorkhali]] Sardar]]\n* The later [[Maratha Empire]] under [[Peshwa]] administration (1749\u20131818) used the title ''Sardar'' to denote a [[Field Marshal]] or [[General of the Army]].\n* ''[[Sirdar (Egypt)|Sirdar]]'' was the official title of the British [[Commander-in-Chief]] of the Anglo-Egyptian army.<ref name=EB1911/>\n* The title ''[[Serdar (Ottoman rank)|Serdar]]'' is also common amongst [[Ottomans]] in referring to a Commander-in-Chief. The [[Serbs]] adopted this usage from the Ottomans (e.g. [[Janko Vukoti\u0107|Serdar Janko Vukoti\u0107]]).\n* In Turkish, ''Serdar'' or ''Serdar-i-Ekrem'' was the title of the Commander-in-Chief in several military operations throughout the Ottoman Empire history.\n* In Afghanistan, ''Sardar-i-Salar'' meant [[Field Marshal]] or [[General of the Army]].\n* In Iran, ''[[Sardar (IRGC)|Sardar]]'' is used to address [[Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps]] high-ranking officers. (see [[List of senior officers of the Islamic Revolutionary Guards]])\n*During the time of [[Ranjit Singh|Maharaja Ranjit Singh]], the term Sardar became even more common as a title given to Sikh men.

It has also been used to denote a chief or leader of a tribe or group. It is used as a Persian synonym of the Arabic title ''[[Emir]]''.\n\nThe term and its cognates originate from [[Persian language|Persian]] ''sard\u0101r'' ({{lang|fa|[[wikt:\u0633\u0631\u062f\u0627\u0631|\u0633\u0631\u062f\u0627\u0631]]}}) and have been historically used across [[Islamic Persia|Persia]] ([[Iran]]), [[Ottoman Empire]] and [[Turkey]] (as \"[[Serdar (Ottoman rank)|Serdar]]\"), [[Mesopotamia]] (now [[Iraq]]), [[Syria]], [[South Asia]] ([[Pakistan]], [[India]], [[Bangladesh]] and [[Nepal]]), the [[Caucasus]], [[Central Asia]], the [[Balkans]] and [[Egypt]] (as \"[[Sirdar]]\").<ref name=EB1911>{{cite EB1911 |wstitle=Sirdar |volume=25 |page=154}}</ref>\n\nThe term was widely used by [[Maratha]] nobility, who held important positions in various [[List of Maratha dynasties and states|Maratha States]] of the imperial [[Maratha Empire]].\n\nAfter the decline of [[feudalism]], ''Sardar'' later indicated a [[Head of State]], a [[Commander-in-chief]], and an Army [[military rank]]. As a military rank, a ''Sardar'' typically marked the [[Commander-in-Chief]] or the highest-ranking [[military officer]] in an Army, akin to the modern [[Field Marshal]], [[General of the Army]] or [[Chief of Army (disambiguation)|Chief of Army]]. The more administrative title ''Sirdar-Bahadur'' denoted a [[Governor-General]] or [[Chief Minister]] of a remote province, akin to a British [[Viceroy]].\n\nIn [[Himalayas|Himalayan]] [[mountaineering]], a ''Sirdar'' is a local leader of the [[Sherpa people|Sherpas]].<ref>{{cite book | last = Sayre  | first = Woodrow Wilson | title = Four Against Everest  | url = https://archive.org/details/fouragainstevere00sayr  | url-access = registration  | publisher = Prentice-Hall | year = 1964  | location = Englewood Cliffs, NJ, USA  | id = Library of Congress Catalog Card No: 64-15208  | page = [https://archive.org/details/fouragainstevere00sayr/page/223 223] }}</ref> Among other duties, he records the heights reached by the individual Sherpas, which factors into their compensation.

For example, the king of [[Kapurthala]] used the title of Sardar.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://members.iinet.net.au/~royalty/ips/k/kapurthala.html|title=Royal Kapurthala Dynasty History}}</ref>\n\n==Noblemen==\n* In [[Balochistan (region)|Baluchistan]], the title ''Sardar'' marked the chief of his tribe.\n* In the [[Emirate of Afghanistan|Royal Afghan Kingdom]], the original ''Nishan-i-Sardari'' (Order of the Leader), founded by [[Am\u0101null\u0101h Kh\u0101n|King Amanullah]] in 1923, was bestowed for exceptional service to the Crown by the Afghan monarch. Recipients enjoyed the titles of ''Sardar-i-Ala'' or ''Sardar-i-Ali'' before their names and also received grants of land. The original Order was disbanded in 1929, and was later revived by [[Mohammed Zahir Shah|King Muhammad Zahir Shah]].\n* In [[Ottoman Turkey]], Serdar was a rank in Montenegro and Serbia. Serdar was also used in the [[Principality of Montenegro]] and the [[Principality of Serbia]] as an honorary \"title\" below that of [[Voivode|Vojvoda]]. For example, [[Janko Vukoti\u0107]] who was a military leader and former prime minister of Montenegro with title of ''Serdar''. However, this were not noble titles as there was no nobility in Serbia and Montenegro and no hereditary titles apart from those borne by members of the reigning families of both countries.\n* In [[Persia]], ''Sardar-i-Bozorg'' was the title of both [[Hossein Khan Sardar]] and his brother Hasan Khan Qajar. Both were uncles of [[Mohammad Khan Qajar|Agha Khan Qajar]], the King-Emperor of Persia and the Commander-in-chief under Emperor [[Fat\u2032h-Ali Shah Qajar]] in the [[Russo-Persian War (1804\u20131813)|Russo-Persian Wars of 1804]] and [[Russo-Persian War (1826\u20131828)|1826]].\n* The early [[feudal]] [[Maratha Empire]] prior to [[Peshwa]] administration (1674\u20131749) used the title ''Sardar'' to identify an imperial court [[Minister (government)|minister]] with military and diplomatic functions. If granted land (''[[jagir]]''), the title ''Sardar'' also marked a [[feudal superior]] responsible for administration, defense and taxing of the granted territory (equivalent to the European title [[Count]], from the French ''comte'' meaning the \"companion\" or delegate to the [[Emperor]] that administered a [[county]]). These ''Sardars'' of the early [[Maratha Empire]] were [[life peers]]; the title was not hereditary.\n* If the ''Sardar'' was appointed to [[Commander-in-Chief]] of all [[Maratha]] forces, the style ''[[Senapati]]'' was used in combination (e.g., ''Sardar Senapati'' or ''Sarsenapati'' Khanderao Yesajirao [[Dabhade]]. The title [[Senapati]] is a [[primogeniture]] hereditary title, as is evidenced by the current ''[[Senapati]]'' Shrimant Sardar Padmasenraje [[Dabhade]] of [[Talegaon Dabhade]].\n* In the [[Maratha Empire]], the more administrative role of ''Sirdar-Bahadur'' denoted a [[Governor General]] or [[Chief Minister]] of a remote [[province]]; this best equates to a [[Mughal Empire|Mughal]] ''[[Subahdar]]'' or British [[Viceroy]] in function and rank.\n* The title ''Sirdar'' was used by Englishmen to describe native noblemen in [[British India]] (e.g., ''Sirdars'' of the [[Deccan Plateau|Deccan]]).\n\n==Aristocrats==\n* In the [[Hazara Division]] of Pakistan, the word ''Sardar'' is used by the [[Karlal]] tribe before their names, traditionally, to stress their upper-caste status, e.g., ''Sardar'' Muhammad Aslam, ''Sardar'' Haider Zaman etc.\n*In the small district of [[Sudhanoti]], [[Kashmir]], ''Sardar'' is used by the hybrid [[Sudhan]] tribe to refer to their putative part-descent from the [[Sadduzai]] clan of King [[Ahmad Shah Durrani]].  Also, Poonch families in this region use ''Sardar'' at the beginning of their names.\n* Similarly ''Sardar'' is used by [[Khattar (tribe)|Khattar]] tribe noble men, native to the districts of [[Attock]] and adjacent areas of [[Rawalpindi]]. \n*''Sardar'' was used for important political, tribal, military and religious officers rankings by the [[Sikh]]s during the period of Maharaja [[Ranjit Singh]] and this title was borrowed from Muslims.\n\n==Head of state==\n* In Persian, ''Sardar i-Azam'' was occasionally used as an alternative title for the [[Shahanshah]]'s Head of government, normally styled ''[[Vazir i-Azam]]'', notably in 1904-06 for a [[Qajar dynasty|Qajar]] prince, Prince [[Major General]] [[Abdol Majid Mirza]].\n* [[Vallabhbhai Patel]], the first Deputy Prime Minister of India was referred to as Sardar Patel; he is also now known as the \"Iron Man of India\".\n* ''Sadr-e-Riyasat'' was the title of one Constitutional [[Head of State]] of the princely state of [[Kashmir]], Yuvaraj Shri Karan Singhji Bahadur, who was appointed as Heir Apparent in 1931. After his father had acceded to India, ending the sovereign Monarchy, Regent in 1949 to 1956. ''Sardar-i-Riyasat'' 1956 to 1965 (succeeded on the death of his father as Maharaja of Jammu and Kashmir, 1961, no longer carrying any hereditary power), next Governor of the Indian constitutive State of [[Jammu and Kashmir]] 1965 to 1967.\n* [[Saparmurat Niyazov]], the authoritarian ruler of [[Turkmenistan]] in 1990\u20142006, carried a few glorifying titles, one of which was ''Serdar'' (\u201cLeader\u201d).<ref>{{cite book|last=Cummings|first=Sally N.|date=2010|title= Symbolism and Power in Central Asia: Politics of the Spectacular|url=|location=Milton, United Kingdom|publisher=Routledge|pages=91-92|isbn= 978-0415575676}}</ref>\n\n==Military title==\n[[File:A Sikh sardar.jpg|right|thumb|A Sikh sardar]]\n[[File:Bhakti Thapa Sardar.jpg|thumb|[[Bhakti Thapa]] - a [[Gorkhali]] Sardar]]\n* The later [[Maratha Empire]] under [[Peshwa]] administration (1749\u20131818) used the title ''Sardar'' to denote a [[Field Marshal]] or [[General of the Army]].\n* ''[[Sirdar (Egypt)|Sirdar]]'' was the official title of the British [[Commander-in-Chief]] of the Anglo-Egyptian army.<ref name=EB1911/>\n* The title ''[[Serdar (Ottoman rank)|Serdar]]'' is also common amongst [[Ottomans]] in referring to a Commander-in-Chief.

He came from a very distinguished family of rabbis, among the most prominent in Germany and Poland. He was a descendant of [[Rashi]] and of the [[Tosafot|Tosafist]], Rabbi [[Meir ben Baruch of Rothenburg]].\n\nHe married Feigele Lipszyc, daughter of Moshe 'Halfon' Lipszyc, in 1811, and settled in Warsaw. They had fourteen children, according to most published sources, most of whom died in infancy.\n\nAlter became known as a [[Talmud]]ic [[Gaon (Hebrew)|gaon]]. At first, he was close to the rebbes of [[Kozhnitz]], however after some years, he was drawn to [[Rebbe]] [[Simcha Bunim of Przysucha|Simcha Bunim]] of [[Przysucha|Prshischa]], whose close adherent he became. After the demise of Simcha Bunim, Alter became a disciple of Rabbi [[Menachem Mendel of Kotzk|Menachem Mendel]] of [[Kock|Kotzk]], also known as the Kotzker Rebbe, who was famous for his acerbic wit and Talmudic brilliance. He was soon followed by a large number of Simcha Bunim's followers.

He came from a very distinguished family of rabbis, among the most prominent in Germany and Poland. He was a descendant of [[Rashi]] and of the [[Tosafot|Tosafist]], Rabbi [[Meir ben Baruch of Rothenburg]].\n\nHe married Feigele Lipszyc, daughter of Moshe 'Halfon' Lipszyc, in 1811, and settled in Warsaw. They had fourteen children, according to most published sources, most of whom died in infancy.\n\nAlter became known as a [[Talmud]]ic [[Gaon (Hebrew)|gaon]]. At first he was close to the rebbes of [[Kozhnitz]]. After some years, he was drawn to [[Rebbe]] [[Simcha Bunim of Przysucha|Simcha Bunim]] of [[Przysucha|Prshischa]], whose close adherent he became. After the demise of Simcha Bunim, Alter became a disciple of Rabbi [[Menachem Mendel of Kotzk|Menachem Mendel]] of [[Kock|Kotzk]], also known as the Kotzker Rebbe, who was famous for his acerbic wit and Talmudic brilliance. He was soon followed by a large number of Simcha Bunim's followers. Alter and the Kotzer Rebbe eventually became brothers-in-law, when the latter married Chaya Lipszyc, the sister of Alter's wife Feigele.\n\nIn 1830 he was forced to change his name to ''Alter'' because of his support towards the [[Poles]] during the [[November Uprising]].\n\nAlter was temporarily succeeded as the Rebbe of the Ger hasidim by his colleague and disciple, Rabbi [[Chanokh Heynekh HaKohen Levin|Chanoch Henoch of Aleksander]].\n\nOne of his sons, Avraham Mordechai, and three daughters, Cyna Pesia, Leah Hudes, and Esther, survived to adulthood and married.
