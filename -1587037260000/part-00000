The main reason for the civil war was an attempt to halt the expansive efforts of the Ibadan city-state, which attempted to replace the Oyo Empire as the dominant region in Yorubaland.<ref>https://opinion.premiumtimesng.com/2017/09/27/kiriji-the-worlds-longest-civil-war-by-adewale-adeoye/</ref> In addition, Ibadan wanted a unified Yoruba nation similar to that of the [[Oyo Empire]], while the Ekiti wanted a loose confederation of cities that had existed in the Ekiti region.\n\nThe fall of the [[Oyo Empire]], which had dominated the region for 500 years left a gap in the government of Yorubaland. Many city states, which were previous provinces of the empire, rose up to replace the dominant Oyo Empire, including Ibadan. Ibadan had won the 1840 Osogbo War and the Battle of Ijaiye in 1862 and had grew in immense power, almost rising to that of its predecessor.\n\nThe Western Yoruba, the Ibadan, were led by the Aare Ona Kakanfo, Obadake Latosa, the military commander-in-chief. They quickly gained the support of people of [[Modakeke]], [[Offa]], and [[Oyo Empire|Oyo]]. The Eastern Yoruba, known as the Ekiti Parapo, were led by Fabunmi from the town of Oke-Mesi and was later led by Saraibi Ogedengbe, the Balogun (Captain) of Ijeshaland. Most of the other Yoruba groups supported the Ekiti, including the [[Ijebu]], [[Ife]], [[Egba people|Egba]], [[Akoko]], [[Igbomina]], [[Ilorin]], and [[Kabba]].<ref>https://odediranodeyinka.wordpress.com/2017/02/08/ogun-kiriji-the-kiriji-war-1877-1893/</ref>\n\nThe civil war saw one of the most technically advanced and decisive wars in Western Africa, with the use of cannons and imported guns from [[Hamburg]], Germany.<ref>https://ruhm.es/index.php/RUHM/article/download/570/494</ref> Weapons were also imported through the Lagos Harbor and Benin. The Ekiti-Parapo also used several modern tactics like the building of trenches and platoons, a spy network with the headquarters in the town of [[Ilara-Mokin]], and the use of animal behavior and symbols as signals in the war.<ref>https://opinion.premiumtimesng.com/2017/09/27/kiriji-the-worlds-longest-civil-war-by-adewale-adeoye/</ref>\n\nThe war unofficially ended with the signing of a peace treaty of September 26, 1886 that granted independence to the Ekiti union.

The main reason for the civil war was an attempt to halt the expansive efforts of the Ibadan city-state, which attempted to replace the Oyo Empire as the dominant region in Yorubaland.<ref>https://opinion.premiumtimesng.com/2017/09/27/kiriji-the-worlds-longest-civil-war-by-adewale-adeoye/</ref> In addition, Ibadan wanted a unified Yoruba nation similar to that of the [[Oyo Empire]], while the Ekiti wanted a loose confederation of cities that had existed in the Ekiti region.\n\nThe fall of the [[Oyo Empire]], which had dominated the region for 500 years left a gap in the government of Yorubaland. Many city states, which were previous provinces of the empire, rose up to replace the dominant Oyo Empire, including Ibadan. Ibadan had won the 1840 Osogbo War and the Battle of Ijaiye in 1862 and had grew in immense power, almost rising to that of its predecessor.\n\nThe Western Yoruba, the Ibadan, were led by the Aare Ona Kakanfo, Obadake Latosa, the military commander-in-chief. They quickly gained the support of people of [[Modakeke]], [[Offa]], and [[Oyo]]. The Eastern Yoruba, known as the Ekiti Parapo, were led by Fabunmi from the town of Oke-Mesi and was later led by Saraibi Ogedengbe, the Balogun (Captain) of Ijeshaland. Most of the other Yoruba groups supported the Ekiti, including the [[Ijebu]], [[Ife]], [[Egba]], [[Akoko]], [[Igbomina]], [[Ilorin]], and [[Kabba]].<ref>https://odediranodeyinka.wordpress.com/2017/02/08/ogun-kiriji-the-kiriji-war-1877-1893/</ref>\n\nThe civil war saw one of the most technically advanced and decisive wars in Western Africa, with the use of cannons and imported guns from [[Hamburg]], Germany.<ref>https://ruhm.es/index.php/RUHM/article/download/570/494</ref> Weapons were also imported through the Lagos Harbor and Benin. The Ekiti-Parapo also used several modern tactics like the building of trenches and platoons, a spy network with the headquarters in the town of [[Ilara-Mokin]], and the use of animal behavior and symbols as signals in the war.<ref>https://opinion.premiumtimesng.com/2017/09/27/kiriji-the-worlds-longest-civil-war-by-adewale-adeoye/</ref>\n\nThe war unofficially ended with the signing of a peace treaty of September 26, 1886 that granted independence to the Ekiti union. However, conflict still occurred around the Ijebu area that did not end till the conquering of the Ijebu by the British during the British-Ijebu War.

European fishing boats had visited Newfoundland continuously since Cabot's second voyage in 1498 and seasonal fishing camps had existed for a century prior. Fishing boats originated from Basque, England, France, and Portugal. However, this changed during the initial stages of [[Anglo-Spanish War (1585\u20131604)|Anglo-Spanish War]], when [[Bernard Drake]] led a [[Newfoundland expedition (1585)|devastating raid]] on the Spanish and Portuguese fisheries in 1585. This provided an opportunity to secure the island and led to the appointment of [[Proprietary Governor]]s to establish colonial settlements on the island from 1610 to 1728. [[John Guy (governor)|John Guy]] became [[List of Newfoundland and Labrador lieutenant-governors|governor]] of the first settlement at [[Cuper's Cove, Newfoundland and Labrador|Cuper's Cove]]. Other settlements included [[Subdivision 1I, Newfoundland and Labrador#Bristol's Hope|Bristol's Hope]], [[Renews]], [[New Cambriol]], [[South Falkland]] and [[Province of Avalon|Avalon]] (which became a province in 1623). The first governor given jurisdiction over all of Newfoundland was [[David Kirke|Sir David Kirke]] in 1638.\n\nExplorers quickly realized the waters around Newfoundland had the best fishing in the North Atlantic.<ref>Grant C. Head, ''Eighteenth Century Newfoundland: A Geographer's Perspective'' (1976)</ref>{{qn|date=November 2016}} By 1620, 300 fishing boats worked the [[Grand Banks of Newfoundland|Grand Banks]], employing some 10,000 sailors; many continuing to come from the [[Basque Country (greater region)|Basque Country]], Normandy, or Brittany. They dried and salted cod on the coast and sold it to Spain and Portugal. Heavy investment by [[George Calvert|Sir George Calvert]], 1st Baron Baltimore, in the 1620s in wharves, warehouses, and fishing stations failed to pay off.

The Mi'kmaq, as allies of the French, were amenable to limited French settlement in their midst and fought alongside them against the English. English attacks on Placentia provoked retaliation by [[New France]] explorer [[Pierre Le Moyne d'Iberville]] who during [[King William's War]] in the 1690s destroyed nearly every English settlement on the island. The entire population of the English colony was either killed, captured for ransom, or sentenced to expulsion to England, with the exception of those who withstood the attack at [[Carbonear Island]] and those in the then remote [[Bonavista, Newfoundland and Labrador|Bonavista]].\n\nAfter France lost political control of the area after the [[Siege of Port Royal (1710)|Siege of Port Royal in 1710]], the M\u00ed'kmaq engaged in warfare with the British throughout [[Dummer's War]] (1722\u20131725), [[King George's War]] (1744\u20131748), [[Father Le Loutre's War]] (1749\u20131755) and the [[French and Indian War]] (1754\u20131763). The French colonization period lasted until the [[Treaty of Utrecht]] of 1713, which ended the [[War of the Spanish Succession]]: France ceded to the British its claims to Newfoundland (including its claims to the shores of [[Hudson Bay]]) and to the French possessions in [[Acadia]]. Afterward, under the supervision of the last French governor, the French population of Plaisance moved to \u00cele Royale (now [[Cape Breton Island]]), part of Acadia which remained then under French control.\n\nIn the [[Treaty of Utrecht]] (1713), France had acknowledged British ownership of the island. However, in the [[Seven Years' War]] (1756\u20131763), control of Newfoundland once again became a major source of conflict between Britain, France and Spain who all pressed for a share in the valuable fishery there. [[Great Britain in the Seven Years War|Britain's victories around the globe]] led [[William Pitt, 1st Earl of Chatham|William Pitt]] to insist nobody other than Britain should have access to Newfoundland. The [[Battle of Signal Hill]] took place in Newfoundland in 1762 when a French force landed and tried to occupy the island, only to be repulsed by the British.\n[[File:Vue de la descente a Terre Neuve par le chevalier de Ternay en 1762.jpg|thumb|A French invasion of the Newfoundland was repulsed during the [[Battle of Signal Hill]] in 1762.]]\nFrom 1763 to 1767 [[James Cook]] made a detailed survey of the coasts of Newfoundland and southern Labrador while commander of {{HMS|Grenville|1754|6}}. (The following year, 1768, Cook began [[First voyage of James Cook|his first circumnavigation of the world]].) In 1796 a Franco-Spanish expedition again [[Newfoundland expedition|succeeded in raiding]] the coasts of Newfoundland and Labrador, destroying many of the settlements.\n\nBy the Treaty of Utrecht (1713), French fishermen gained the right to land and cure fish on the \"French Shore\" on the western coast. (They had a permanent base on nearby [[St. Pierre and Miquelon]] islands; the French gave up their French Shore rights in 1904.) In 1783 the British signed the [[Treaty of Paris (1783)|Treaty of Paris]] with the United States that gave American fishermen similar rights along the coast. These rights were reaffirmed by treaties in 1818, 1854 and 1871 and confirmed by arbitration in 1910.\n\nIn 1854 the British government established Newfoundland's [[responsible government]].<ref>\n{{cite web\n|url= http://www.heritage.nf.ca/law/representative.html \n|title= Representative Government, 1832\u20131855\n|last= Webb |first= Jeff \n|accessdate= October 17, 2008\n}}\n</ref>\nIn 1855, [[Philip Francis Little]], a native of [[Prince Edward Island]], won a parliamentary majority over [[Hugh Hoyles]] and the [[Conservative Party of Newfoundland|Conservatives]].

[[Ice hockey]], however, remains popular; a minor league professional team called the [[Newfoundland Growlers]] of the [[ECHL]] plays at the [[Mile One Centre]] in St. John's since the 2018\u201319 season. The area had an intermittent [[American Hockey League]] presence with the [[St. John's Maple Leafs]] then [[St. John's IceCaps]] until 2017, and the [[Newfoundland Senior Hockey League]] has teams around the island. Since the departure of the [[St. John's Fog Devils]] in 2008, Newfoundland and Labrador is the only province in Canada to not have a team in the major junior [[Canadian Hockey League]] (should one ever join it would be placed in the [[Quebec Major Junior Hockey League|QMJHL]], which hosted the Fog Devils and has jurisdiction over Atlantic Canada).\n\n[[Association football]] (soccer) and [[rugby union]] are both more popular in Newfoundland and Labrador than the rest of Canada in general. Soccer is hosted at [[King George V Park]], a 6,000-seat stadium built as Newfoundland's national stadium during the time as an independent dominion. [[Swilers Rugby Park]] is home of the [[Swilers RFC]] rugby union club, as well as the [[Atlantic Rock]], one of the four regional teams in the [[Canadian Rugby Championship]]. Other sports facilities in Newfoundland and Labrador include [[Pepsi Centre]], an indoor arena in Corner Brook; [[Shamrock Field]], Canada's national Gaelic Games venue in St. John's; and [[St. Patrick's Park]], a baseball park in St. John's.\n\n[[Gridiron football]], be it either [[American football|American]] or [[Canadian football|Canadian]], is almost nonexistent; it is the only Canadian province other than [[Prince Edward Island]] to have never hosted a [[Canadian Football League]] or [[CIS football|Canadian Interuniversity Sport]] game, and it was not until 2013 the province saw its first amateur teams form.\n\n[[Cricket]] was once a popular sport. The earliest mention is in the ''Newfoundland Mercantile Journal'', Thursday September 16, 1824, indicating the St. John's Cricket Club was an established club at this time.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.canadacricket.com/nlcricket/?page_id=4|title=History \u2013 Cricket Newfoundland and Labrador|website=www.canadacricket.com}}</ref> The St. John's Cricket club was one of the first cricket clubs in North America. Other centres were at [[Harbour Grace]], [[Twillingate]], and [[Trinity, Newfoundland and Labrador|Trinity]]. The heyday of the game was the late nineteenth and early twentieth century, at which time there was league in St. John's, as well as an interschool tournament. John Shannon Munn is Newfoundland's most famous cricketer, having represented Oxford University. After the first World War, cricket declined in popularity and was replaced by soccer and baseball. However, with the arrival of immigrants from the [[Indian subcontinent]],\ncricket is once again gaining interest in the province.<ref>Cricket Newfoundland and Labrador</ref>\n\n==Transportation==\n{{See also|List of bridges in Canada|List of Newfoundland and Labrador highways|List of airports in Newfoundland and Labrador}}\n[[File:Route 500 Churchill Falls - Labrador City.jpg|thumb|left|The Trans-Labrador Highway is the primary highway for Labrador.]]\n\n===Ferries===\nWithin the province, the Newfoundland and Labrador Department of Transportation and Works operates or sponsors 15 automobile, passenger and freight ferry routes which connect various communities along the province's significant coastline.<ref>{{cite web|title=Summary of Services Available|url=http://www.tw.gov.nl.ca/ferryservices/schedules/highlights.html|publisher=Department of Transportation and Works|accessdate=February 20, 2013}}</ref>\n\nA regular passenger and car ferry service, lasting about 90 minutes, crosses the [[Strait of Belle Isle]], connecting the province's [[island of Newfoundland]] with the region of [[Labrador]] on the mainland.

European fishing boats had visited Newfoundland continuously since Cabot's second voyage in 1498 and seasonal fishing camps had existed for a century prior. Fishing boats originated from Basque, England, France, and Portugal. However, this changed during the initial stages of [[Anglo-Spanish War (1585\u20131604)|Anglo-Spanish War]], when [[Bernard Drake]] led a [[Newfoundland expedition (1585)|devastating raid]] on the Spanish and Portuguese fisheries in 1585. This provided an opportunity to secure the island and led to the appointment of [[Proprietary Governor]]s to establish colonial settlements on the island from 1610 to 1728. [[John Guy (governor)|John Guy]] became [[List of Newfoundland and Labrador lieutenant-governors|governor]] of the first settlement at [[Cuper's Cove, Newfoundland and Labrador|Cuper's Cove]]. Other settlements included [[Subdivision 1I, Newfoundland and Labrador#Bristol's Hope|Bristol's Hope]], [[Renews]], [[New Cambriol]], [[South Falkland]] and [[Province of Avalon|Avalon]] (which became a province in 1623). The first governor given jurisdiction over all of Newfoundland was [[David Kirke|Sir David Kirke]] in 1638.\n\nExplorers quickly realized the waters around Newfoundland had the best fishing in the North Atlantic.<ref>Grant C. Head, ''Eighteenth Century Newfoundland: A Geographer's Perspective'' (1976)</ref>{{qn|date=November 2016}} By 1620, 300 fishing boats worked the [[Grand Banks of Newfoundland|Grand Banks]], employing some 10,000 sailors; many continuing to come from the [[Basque Country (greater region)|Basque Country]], Normandy, or Brittany. They dried and salted cod on the coast and sold it to Spain and Portugal. Heavy investment by [[George Calvert|Sir George Calvert]], 1st Baron Baltimore, in the 1620s in wharves, warehouses, and fishing stations failed to pay off.

The Mi'kmaq, as allies of the French, were amenable to limited French settlement in their midst and fought alongside them against the English. English attacks on Placentia provoked retaliation by [[New France]] explorer [[Pierre Le Moyne d'Iberville]] who during [[King William's War]] in the 1690s destroyed nearly every English settlement on the island. The entire population of the English colony was either killed, captured for ransom, or sentenced to expulsion to England, with the exception of those who withstood the attack at [[Carbonear Island]] and those in the then remote [[Bonavista, Newfoundland and Labrador|Bonavista]].\n\nAfter France lost political control of the area after the [[Siege of Port Royal (1710)|Siege of Port Royal in 1710]], the M\u00ed'kmaq engaged in warfare with the British throughout [[Dummer's War]] (1722\u20131725), [[King George's War]] (1744\u20131748), [[Father Le Loutre's War]] (1749\u20131755) and the [[French and Indian War]] (1754\u20131763). The French colonization period lasted until the [[Treaty of Utrecht]] of 1713, which ended the [[War of the Spanish Succession]]: France ceded to the British its claims to Newfoundland (including its claims to the shores of [[Hudson Bay]]) and to the French possessions in [[Acadia]]. Afterward, under the supervision of the last French governor, the French population of Plaisance moved to \u00cele Royale (now [[Cape Breton Island]]), part of Acadia which remained then under French control.\n\nIn the [[Treaty of Utrecht]] (1713), France had acknowledged British ownership of the island. However, in the [[Seven Years' War]] (1756\u20131763), control of Newfoundland once again became a major source of conflict between Britain, France and Spain who all pressed for a share in the valuable fishery there. [[Great Britain in the Seven Years War|Britain's victories around the globe]] led [[William Pitt, 1st Earl of Chatham|William Pitt]] to insist nobody other than Britain should have access to Newfoundland. The [[Battle of Signal Hill]] took place in Newfoundland in 1762 when a French force landed and tried to occupy the island, only to be repulsed by the British.\n[[File:Vue de la descente a Terre Neuve par le chevalier de Ternay en 1762.jpg|thumb|A French invasion of the Newfoundland was repulsed during the [[Battle of Signal Hill]] in 1762.]]\nFrom 1763 to 1767 [[James Cook]] made a detailed survey of the coasts of Newfoundland and southern Labrador while commander of {{HMS|Grenville|1754|6}}. (The following year, 1768, Cook began [[First voyage of James Cook|his first circumnavigation of the world]].) In 1796 a Franco-Spanish expedition again [[Newfoundland expedition|succeeded in raiding]] the coasts of Newfoundland and Labrador, destroying many of the settlements.\n\nBy the Treaty of Utrecht (1713), French fishermen gained the right to land and cure fish on the \"French Shore\" on the western coast. (They had a permanent base on nearby [[St. Pierre and Miquelon]] islands; the French gave up their French Shore rights in 1904.) In 1783 the British signed the [[Treaty of Paris (1783)|Treaty of Paris]] with the United States that gave American fishermen similar rights along the coast. These rights were reaffirmed by treaties in 1818, 1854 and 1871 and confirmed by arbitration in 1910.\n\nIn 1854 the British government established Newfoundland's [[responsible government]].<ref>\n{{cite web\n|url= http://www.heritage.nf.ca/law/representative.html \n|title= Representative Government, 1832\u20131855\n|last= Webb |first= Jeff \n|accessdate= October 17, 2008\n}}\n</ref>\nIn 1855, [[Philip Francis Little]], a native of [[Prince Edward Island]], won a parliamentary majority over [[Hugh Hoyles]] and the [[Conservative Party of Newfoundland|Conservatives]].

[[Ice hockey]], however, remains popular; a minor league professional team called the [[Newfoundland Growlers]] of the [[ECHL]] plays at the [[Mile One Centre]] in St. John's since the 2018\u201319 season. The area had an intermittent [[American Hockey League]] presence with the [[St. John's Maple Leafs]] then [[St. John's IceCaps]] until 2017, and the [[Newfoundland Senior Hockey League]] has teams around the island. Since the departure of the [[St. John's Fog Devils]] in 2008, Newfoundland and Labrador is the only province in Canada to not have a team in the major junior [[Canadian Hockey League]] (should one ever join it would be placed in the [[Quebec Major Junior Hockey League|QMJHL]], which hosted the Fog Devils and has jurisdiction over Atlantic Canada).\n\n[[Association football]] (soccer) and [[rugby union]] are both more popular in Newfoundland and Labrador than the rest of Canada in general. Soccer is hosted at [[King George V Park]], a 6,000-seat stadium built as Newfoundland's national stadium during the time as an independent dominion. [[Swilers Rugby Park]] is home of the [[Swilers RFC]] rugby union club, as well as the [[Atlantic Rock]], one of the four regional teams in the [[Canadian Rugby Championship]]. Other sports facilities in Newfoundland and Labrador include [[Pepsi Centre]], an indoor arena in Corner Brook; [[Shamrock Field]], Canada's national Gaelic Games venue in St. John's; and [[St. Patrick's Park]], a baseball park in St. John's.\n\n[[Gridiron football]], be it either [[American football|American]] or [[Canadian football|Canadian]], is almost nonexistent; it is the only Canadian province other than [[Prince Edward Island]] to have never hosted a [[Canadian Football League]] or [[CIS football|Canadian Interuniversity Sport]] game, and it was not until 2013 the province saw its first amateur teams form.\n\n[[Cricket]] was once a popular sport. The earliest mention is in the ''Newfoundland Mercantile Journal'', Thursday September 16, 1824, indicating the St. John's Cricket Club was an established club at this time.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.canadacricket.com/nlcricket/?page_id=4|title=History \u2013 Cricket Newfoundland and Labrador|website=www.canadacricket.com}}</ref> The St. John's Cricket club was one of the first cricket clubs in North America. Other centres were at [[Harbour Grace]], [[Twillingate]], and [[Trinity, Newfoundland and Labrador|Trinity]]. The heyday of the game was the late nineteenth and early twentieth century, at which time there was league in St. John's, as well as an interschool tournament. John Shannon Munn is Newfoundland's most famous cricketer, having represented Oxford University. After the first World War, cricket declined in popularity and was replaced by soccer and baseball.

Though these \"non-traditional\" hydrogen bonding interactions are often quite weak (~1 kcal/mol), they are also ubiquitous and are increasingly recognized as important control elements in receptor-ligand interactions in medicinal chemistry or intra-/intermolecular interactions in materials sciences.   The definition of hydrogen bonding has gradually broadened over time to include these weaker attractive interactions.  In 2011, an [[IUPAC]] Task Group recommended a modern evidence-based definition of hydrogen bonding, which was published in the [[IUPAC]] journal ''[[Pure and Applied Chemistry]]''. This definition specifies:\n{{quote|The hydrogen bond is an attractive interaction between a hydrogen atom from a molecule or a molecular fragment X\u2013H in which X is more electronegative than H, and an atom or a group of atoms in the same or a different molecule, in which there is evidence of bond formation.<ref name=\"arunen2011\">{{cite journal|title = Definition of the hydrogen bond|journal = [[Pure Appl.

In a discrete water molecule, there are two hydrogen atoms and one oxygen atom.  Two molecules of [[water]] can form a hydrogen bond between them that is to say [[oxygen-hydrogen bonding]]; the simplest case, when only two molecules are present, is called the [[water dimer]] and is often used as a model system. When more molecules are present, as is the case with liquid water, more bonds are possible because the oxygen of one water molecule has two lone pairs of electrons, each of which can form a hydrogen bond with a hydrogen on another water molecule. This can repeat such that every water molecule is H-bonded with up to four other molecules, as shown in the figure (two through its two lone pairs, and two through its two hydrogen atoms). Hydrogen bonding strongly affects the [[crystal structure]] of [[ice]], helping to create an open hexagonal lattice. The density of ice is less than the density of water at the same temperature; thus, the solid phase of water floats on the liquid, unlike most other substances.\n\n[[Liquid]] water's high [[boiling point]] is due to the high number of hydrogen bonds each molecule can form, relative to its low [[molecular mass]]. Owing to the difficulty of breaking these bonds, water has a very high boiling point, melting point, and viscosity compared to otherwise similar liquids not conjoined by hydrogen bonds. Water is unique because its oxygen atom has two lone pairs and two hydrogen atoms, meaning that the total number of bonds of a water molecule is up to four.\n\nThe number of hydrogen bonds formed by a molecule of liquid water fluctuates with time and temperature.<ref name=\"Jorgensen1985\"/>   From [[water model|TIP4P]] liquid water simulations at 25&nbsp;\u00b0C, it was estimated that each water molecule participates in an average of 3.59 hydrogen bonds.

For example, the double helical structure of [[DNA]] is due largely to hydrogen bonding between its [[base pair]]s (as well as [[pi stacking]] interactions), which link one complementary strand to the other and enable [[DNA replication|replication]].\n\n===Proteins===\nIn the [[Protein secondary structure|secondary structure of proteins]], hydrogen bonds form between the backbone oxygens and [[amide]] hydrogens.  When the spacing of the [[amino acid]] residues participating in a hydrogen bond occurs regularly between positions ''i'' and ''i''&nbsp;+&nbsp;4, an [[alpha helix]] is formed.  When the spacing is less, between positions ''i'' and ''i''&nbsp;+&nbsp;3, then a [[3 10 helix|3<sub>10</sub> helix]] is formed. When two strands are joined by hydrogen bonds involving alternating residues on each participating strand, a [[beta sheet]] is formed. Hydrogen bonds also play a part in forming the tertiary structure of protein through interaction of R-groups. (See also [[protein folding]]).\n\n[[Bifurcated H-bond]] systems are common in alpha-helical [[transmembrane proteins]] between the backbone amide C=O of residue ''i'' as the H-bond acceptor and two H-bond donors from residue ''i+4'': the backbone amide N-H and a side-chain hydroxyl or thiol H<sup>+</sup>. The energy preference of the bifurcated H-bond hydroxyl or thiol system is -3.4 kcal/mol or -2.6 kcal/mol, respectively. This type of bifurcated H-bond provides an intrahelical H-bonding partner for polar side-chains, such as [[serine]], [[threonine]], and [[cysteine]] within the hydrophobic membrane environments.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Feldblum|first=Esther S.|author2=Arkin, Isaiah T.|title=Strength of a bifurcated H bond|journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences|volume=111|issue=11|pages=4085\u20134090|year=2014|url=http://www.pnas.org/content/early/2014/02/26/1319827111|doi=10.1073/pnas.1319827111|pmid=24591597|pmc=3964065}}</ref>\n\nThe role of hydrogen bonds in protein folding has also been linked to osmolyte-induced protein stabilization. Protective osmolytes, such as [[trehalose]] and [[sorbitol]], shift the protein folding equilibrium toward the folded state, in a concentration dependent manner. While the prevalent explanation for osmolyte action relies on excluded volume effects that are entropic in nature, recent [[circular dichroism]] (CD) experiments have shown osmolyte to act through an enthalpic effect.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Politi|first=Regina|author2=Harries, Daniel|title=Enthalpically driven peptide stabilization by protective osmolytes|journal=ChemComm|year=2010|volume=46|pages=6449\u20136451|doi=10.1039/C0CC01763A|pmid=20657920|issue=35}}</ref> The molecular mechanism for their role in protein stabilization is still not well established, though several mechanisms have been proposed.

However, washing at high temperatures can permanently break the hydrogen bonds and a garment may permanently lose its shape.\n\n===Cellulose===\nHydrogen bonds are important in the structure of [[cellulose]] and derived polymers in its many different forms in nature, such as [[cotton]] and [[flax]].\n\n[[Image:Kevlar chemical structure.png|thumb|400px|Para-aramid structure]]\n[[Image:Cellulose strand.svg|thumb|right|260px|A strand of cellulose (conformation I<sub>&alpha;</sub>), showing the hydrogen bonds (dashed) within and between cellulose molecules]]\n\n===Synthetic polymers===\nMany [[polymer]]s are strengthened by hydrogen bonds within and between the chains. Among the [[synthetic polymer]]s, a well characterized example is [[nylon]], where hydrogen bonds occur in the [[repeat unit]] and play a major role in [[crystallization]] of the material. The bonds occur between [[carbonyl]] and [[amine]] groups in the [[amide]] repeat unit. They effectively link adjacent chains, which help reinforce the material. The effect is great in [[aramid]] [[fibre]], where hydrogen bonds stabilize the linear chains laterally. The chain axes are aligned along the fibre axis, making the fibres extremely stiff and strong.\n\nThe hydrogen-bond networks make both natural and synthetic polymers sensitive to [[humidity]] levels in the atmosphere because water molecules can diffuse into the surface and disrupt the network. Some polymers are more sensitive than others. Thus [[nylon]]s are more sensitive than [[aramid]]s, and [[nylon 6]] more sensitive than [[nylon-11]].\n\n==Symmetric hydrogen bond==\nA [[symmetric hydrogen bond]] is a special type of hydrogen bond in which the proton is spaced exactly halfway between two identical atoms. The strength of the bond to each of those atoms is equal. It is an example of a [[three-center four-electron bond]]. This type of bond is much stronger than a \"normal\" hydrogen bond. The effective bond order is 0.5, so its strength is comparable to a covalent bond. It is seen in ice at high pressure, and also in the solid phase of many anhydrous acids such as [[hydrofluoric acid]] and [[formic acid]] at high pressure. It is also seen in the [[bifluoride]] ion [F--H--F]<sup>\u2212</sup>.

Though these \"non-traditional\" hydrogen bonding interactions are often quite weak (~1 kcal/mol), they are also ubiquitous and are increasingly recognized as important control elements in receptor-ligand interactions in medicinal chemistry or intra-/intermolecular interactions in materials sciences.   The definition of hydrogen bonding has gradually broadened over time to include these weaker attractive interactions.  In 2011, an [[IUPAC]] Task Group recommended a modern evidence-based definition of hydrogen bonding, which was published in the [[IUPAC]] journal ''[[Pure and Applied Chemistry]]''. This definition specifies:\n{{quote|The hydrogen bond is an attractive interaction between a hydrogen atom from a molecule or a molecular fragment X\u2013H in which X is more electronegative than H, and an atom or a group of atoms in the same or a different molecule, in which there is evidence of bond formation.<ref name=\"arunen2011\">{{cite journal|title = Definition of the hydrogen bond|journal = [[Pure Appl.

In a discrete water molecule, there are two hydrogen atoms and one oxygen atom.  Two molecules of [[water]] can form a hydrogen bond between them that is to say [[oxygen-hydrogen bonding]]; the simplest case, when only two molecules are present, is called the [[water dimer]] and is often used as a model system. When more molecules are present, as is the case with liquid water, more bonds are possible because the oxygen of one water molecule has two lone pairs of electrons, each of which can form a hydrogen bond with a hydrogen on another water molecule. This can repeat such that every water molecule is H-bonded with up to four other molecules, as shown in the figure (two through its two lone pairs, and two through its two hydrogen atoms). Hydrogen bonding strongly affects the [[crystal structure]] of [[ice]], helping to create an open hexagonal lattice. The density of ice is less than the density of water at the same temperature; thus, the solid phase of water floats on the liquid, unlike most other substances.\n\n[[Liquid]] water's high [[boiling point]] is due to the high number of hydrogen bonds each molecule can form, relative to its low [[molecular mass]]. Owing to the difficulty of breaking these bonds, water has a very high boiling point, melting point, and viscosity compared to otherwise similar liquids not conjoined by hydrogen bonds. Water is unique because its oxygen atom has two lone pairs and two hydrogen atoms, meaning that the total number of bonds of a water molecule is up to four.\n\nThe number of hydrogen bonds formed by a molecule of liquid water fluctuates with time and temperature.<ref name=\"Jorgensen1985\"/>   From [[water model|TIP4P]] liquid water simulations at 25&nbsp;\u00b0C, it was estimated that each water molecule participates in an average of 3.59 hydrogen bonds. At 100&nbsp;\u00b0C, this number decreases to 3.24 due to the increased molecular motion and decreased density, while at 0&nbsp;\u00b0C, the average number of hydrogen bonds increases to 3.69.<ref name=\"Jorgensen1985\">{{cite journal|author1=Jorgensen, W.

For example, the double helical structure of [[DNA]] is due largely to hydrogen bonding between its [[base pair]]s (as well as [[pi stacking]] interactions), which link one complementary strand to the other and enable [[DNA replication|replication]].\n\n===Proteins===\nIn the [[Protein secondary structure|secondary structure of proteins]], hydrogen bonds form between the backbone oxygens and [[amide]] hydrogens.  When the spacing of the [[amino acid]] residues participating in a hydrogen bond occurs regularly between positions ''i'' and ''i''&nbsp;+&nbsp;4, an [[alpha helix]] is formed.  When the spacing is less, between positions ''i'' and ''i''&nbsp;+&nbsp;3, then a [[3 10 helix|3<sub>10</sub> helix]] is formed. When two strands are joined by hydrogen bonds involving alternating residues on each participating strand, a [[beta sheet]] is formed. Hydrogen bonds also play a part in forming the tertiary structure of protein through interaction of R-groups. (See also [[protein folding]]).\n\n[[Bifurcated H-bond]] systems are common in alpha-helical [[transmembrane proteins]] between the backbone amide C=O of residue ''i'' as the H-bond acceptor and two H-bond donors from residue ''i+4'': the backbone amide N-H and a side-chain hydroxyl or thiol H<sup>+</sup>. The energy preference of the bifurcated H-bond hydroxyl or thiol system is -3.4 kcal/mol or -2.6 kcal/mol, respectively. This type of bifurcated H-bond provides an intrahelical H-bonding partner for polar side-chains, such as [[serine]], [[threonine]], and [[cysteine]] within the hydrophobic membrane environments.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Feldblum|first=Esther S.|author2=Arkin, Isaiah T.|title=Strength of a bifurcated H bond|journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences|volume=111|issue=11|pages=4085\u20134090|year=2014|url=http://www.pnas.org/content/early/2014/02/26/1319827111|doi=10.1073/pnas.1319827111|pmid=24591597|pmc=3964065}}</ref>\n\nThe role of hydrogen bonds in protein folding has also been linked to osmolyte-induced protein stabilization. Protective osmolytes, such as [[trehalose]] and [[sorbitol]], shift the protein folding equilibrium toward the folded state, in a concentration dependent manner. While the prevalent explanation for osmolyte action relies on excluded volume effects that are entropic in nature, recent [[circular dichroism]] (CD) experiments have shown osmolyte to act through an enthalpic effect.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Politi|first=Regina|author2=Harries, Daniel|title=Enthalpically driven peptide stabilization by protective osmolytes|journal=ChemComm|year=2010|volume=46|pages=6449\u20136451|doi=10.1039/C0CC01763A|pmid=20657920|issue=35}}</ref> The molecular mechanism for their role in protein stabilization is still not well established, though several mechanisms have been proposed.

However, washing at high temperatures can permanently break the hydrogen bonds and a garment may permanently lose its shape.\n\n===Cellulose===\nHydrogen bonds are important in the structure of [[cellulose]] and derived polymers in its many different forms in nature, such as [[cotton]] and [[flax]].\n\n[[Image:Kevlar chemical structure.png|thumb|400px|Para-aramid structure]]\n[[Image:Cellulose strand.svg|thumb|right|260px|A strand of cellulose (conformation I<sub>&alpha;</sub>), showing the hydrogen bonds (dashed) within and between cellulose molecules]]\n\n===Synthetic polymers===\nMany [[polymer]]s are strengthened by hydrogen bonds within and between the chains. Among the [[synthetic polymer]]s, a well characterized example is [[nylon]], where hydrogen bonds occur in the [[repeat unit]] and play a major role in [[crystallization]] of the material. The bonds occur between [[carbonyl]] and [[amine]] groups in the [[amide]] repeat unit. They effectively link adjacent chains, which help reinforce the material. The effect is great in [[aramid]] [[fibre]], where hydrogen bonds stabilize the linear chains laterally. The chain axes are aligned along the fibre axis, making the fibres extremely stiff and strong.\n\nThe hydrogen-bond networks make both natural and synthetic polymers sensitive to [[humidity]] levels in the atmosphere because water molecules can diffuse into the surface and disrupt the network. Some polymers are more sensitive than others. Thus [[nylon]]s are more sensitive than [[aramid]]s, and [[nylon 6]] more sensitive than [[nylon-11]].\n\n==Symmetric hydrogen bond==\nA [[symmetric hydrogen bond]] is a special type of hydrogen bond in which the proton is spaced exactly halfway between two identical atoms. The strength of the bond to each of those atoms is equal. It is an example of a [[three-center four-electron bond]]. This type of bond is much stronger than a \"normal\" hydrogen bond. The effective bond order is 0.5, so its strength is comparable to a covalent bond. It is seen in ice at high pressure, and also in the solid phase of many anhydrous acids such as [[hydrofluoric acid]] and [[formic acid]] at high pressure. It is also seen in the [[bifluoride]] ion [F--H--F]<sup>\u2212</sup>.

In the dihydrogen bond, however, a metal hydride serves as a proton acceptor, thus forming a hydrogen-hydrogen interaction.

He had signed the marriage license and its bond on 1 July as 2Josias Emery, of the parish of St Ann <nowiki>[</nowiki>[[Soho]], Westminster], watchmaker, bachelor, age 30.\" \n\nThrough this first marriage Emery was connected to Westminster-based goldsmiths, jewellers, watchcase makers, and clockmakers, several of them [[Huguenot]] or of Huguenot descent.\n\nEmery\u2019s wife Anne Jacob was the eldest daughter of Jean Jacob (1709-1787), also known as John Jacob, a Huguenot goldsmith who had arrived in London c.1732.\n\nJean Jacob\u2019s wife, Emery\u2019s mother-in-law, was Anne Courtauld (1709-1793), eldest daughter of [[Augustin Courtauld]] (1686-1751) the Huguenot goldsmith of St Martin\u2019s Lane in Westminster, and ancestor of the Courtauld family of textile and art collection fame. \n\nEmery\u2019s aunt by marriage, Esther Courtauld (1711-1763), Augustin\u2019s second daughter, had married Etienne/Stephen Goujon (1696-1778), also of Huguenot descent and an eminent watchcase maker in Gerard Street, Westminster. \n\nEmery\u2019s sister-in-law Judith Jacob married in 1767 George Cowles, also goldsmith, originally from [[Gloucester]], who had been apprenticed in 1751 to Anne and Judith\u2019s uncle [[Samuel Courtauld (goldsmith)|Samuel Courtauld]] (1720-1765), goldsmith, with premises in [[Cornhill, London|Cornhill]] opposite the [[Royal Exchange, London|Royal Exchange]] in the [[City of London]]. In 1765, George Cowles went into partnership with Samuel\u2019s widow Louisa Perina Courtauld n\u00e9e Ogier ([[Louisa Courtauld]]) after Samuel\u2019s sudden death age 44. The Louisa Courtauld & George Cowles partnership lasted until 1777, by which time Samuel junior was 25.\n\nEmery was also related by marriage, a little more distantly, to Thomas Johnson (c.1727-1775), clockmaker of Grays Inn Passage, who had married Anne Courtauld\u2019s first cousin Anne Bardin (1717-1761). Thomas and Anne\u2019s only surviving son John Johnson (1757-1800) became a clockmaker at the same premises in Grays Inn Passage after his father\u2019s early death.\n\n== Residence and premises ==\n\nJosiah\u2019s premises on Cockspur Street are recorded in Westminster Rate Books and Land Tax Records 1767-1791, and he served on the parish coroner\u2019s inquest jury on occasions in 1771, 1773, 1777 and 1780. The precise address on Cockspur Street is recorded variously at no.2, no.3, no.33 and facing Pall Mall. His brother\u2014in-law Denis Jacob, jeweller and Anne\u2019s half brother, had his premises at 37 Cockspur Street, and the coroner\u2019s inquest into the death of Denis\u2019 wife at home in Nov 1777, refers to the Emerys being the next door neighbours of the Jacobs. There are no records for Josiah Emery in Westminster after 1791. \n\n== Death ==\n\nJosiah Emery died in Chelsea on 2 July 1794, leaving a very short Will written the same day and in French, his mother tongue, leaving all his estate to his second wife Susanna (n\u00e9e Smith b.1746) except \u00a310 to his unmarried and only surviving child Elizabeth.

Elizabeth married William Reynolds in 1810. We glimpse that Elizabeth was a woman of learning and interested in history. Her uncle Augustin Jacob died with no surviving issue in 1811, sharing his considerable estate between his two surviving siblings and 10 nephews and nieces. To Elizabeth he left family portraits, and most of his book collection, including his books in French: Martin\u2019s French Bible, the French Book of Common Prayer as published 1678, and four volumes of \u2018Gil Blas\u2019, and others; also history books in English: Plutarch\u2019s Lives, Josephus\u2019 Jewish Wars, a \u201cMiscellaneous History from the Creation of the World to William the Conqueror\u201d, as well as Chambers Dictionary in 2 folios, a Biographical Dictionary and others.\n\n==Examples of his work==\n* The Nelson watch <ref name=Nelson/>\n* The Prince of Wales watch <ref name=Prince-of-Wales/>\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n{{Authority control}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Emery, Josiah}}\n[[Category:Swiss inventors]]\n[[Category:English watchmakers (people)]]\n[[Category:English clockmakers]]\n[[Category:Swiss watchmakers (people)]]\n[[Category:Swiss clockmakers]]\n<!--[[Category:Scientific instrument makers]]-->\n[[Category:People from Geneva]]\n[[Category:18th-century Swiss people]]\n[[Category:1720s births]]\n[[Category:1797 deaths]]\n[[Category:Watchmakers (people)]]\n[[Category:18th-century Swiss businesspeople]]\n\n\n{{England-bio-stub}}\n{{Switzerland-bio-stub}}\n", "text_old": "'''Josiah Emery''' (c. 1731/32 - 1794) was a watch and clock maker who improved [[Thomas Mudge (horologist)|Thomas Mudge's]] [[History of watches|lever escapement]] in 1785.
