It shares borders with [[Western Australia]] to the west ([[129th meridian east]]), [[South Australia]] to the south ([[26th parallel south]]), and [[Queensland]] to the east ([[138th meridian east]]). To the north, the territory looks out to the [[Timor Sea]], the [[Arafura Sea]] and the [[Gulf of Carpentaria]], including [[Western New Guinea]] and other [[Indonesia]]n islands. The NT covers {{convert|1349129|km2|0}}, making it the third-largest Australian federal division, and [[List of country subdivisions by area|the 11th-largest country subdivision in the world]]. It is sparsely populated, with a population of only 245,800,<ref name=ABSPop/> fewer than half as many people as [[Tasmania]].<ref name=ABSPop/>\n\nThe archaeological [[history of the Northern Territory]] begins over 40,000 years ago when [[Indigenous Australians]] settled the region. [[Makassan contact with Australia|Makassan traders]] began trading with the indigenous people of the Northern Territory for [[Sea cucumber (food)|trepang]] from at least the 18th century onwards. The coast of the territory was first seen by Europeans in the 17th century. The British were the first Europeans to attempt to settle the coastal regions. After three failed attempts to establish a settlement (1824\u201328, 1838\u201349, and 1864\u201366), success was achieved in 1869 with the establishment of a settlement at [[Darwin, Northern Territory|Port Darwin]]. Today the economy is based on tourism, especially [[Kakadu National Park]] in the [[Top End]] and the [[Ulu\u1e5fu-Kata Tju\u1e6fa National Park]] (Ayers Rock) in central Australia, and mining.\n\nThe capital and largest city is [[Darwin, Northern Territory|Darwin]]. The population is concentrated in coastal regions and along the [[Stuart Highway]]. The other major settlements are (in order of size) [[Palmerston, Northern Territory|Palmerston]], [[Alice Springs]], [[Katherine, Northern Territory|Katherine]], [[Nhulunbuy]] and [[Tennant Creek]]. Residents of the Northern Territory are often known simply as \"Territorians\" and fully as \"Northern Territorians\", or more informally as \"Top Enders\" and \"Centralians\".\n\n==History==\n[[File:Thomas Baines, Thomas Baines with Aborigines near the mouth of the Victoria River, N.T, 1857.jpg|thumb|left|[[Thomas Baines]] with Aborigines near the mouth of the [[Victoria River (Northern Territory)|Victoria River]].]]\n{{main|History of the Northern Territory}}\n[[Indigenous Australians]] have lived in the present area of the Northern Territory for at least 65,000 years,<ref name=\"Clarkson Jacobs Marwick Fullagar 2017 pp. 306\u2013310\">{{cite journal | last=Clarkson | first=Chris | last2=Jacobs | first2=Zenobia | last3=Marwick | first3=Ben | last4=Fullagar | first4=Richard | last5=Wallis | first5=Lynley | last6=Smith | first6=Mike | last7=Roberts | first7=Richard G. | last8=Hayes | first8=Elspeth | last9=Lowe | first9=Kelsey | last10=Carah | first10=Xavier | last11=Florin | first11=S.

The land now occupied by the Northern Territory was part of colonial [[New South Wales]] from 1825 to 1863, except for a brief time from February to December 1846, when it was part of the short-lived colony of [[North Australia]]. The Northern Territory was part of South Australia from 1863 to 1911. Under the administration of colonial South Australia, the [[Australian Overland Telegraph Line|overland telegraph]] was constructed between 1870 and 1872.\n\nFrom its establishment in 1869 the Port of Darwin was the major Territory supply for many decades.\n\nA railway was built between [[Palmerston, Northern Territory|Palmerston]] and [[Pine Creek, Northern Territory|Pine Creek]] between 1883 and 1889. The economic pattern of cattle raising and mining was established so that by 1911 there were 513,000 cattle. [[Victoria River Downs Station|Victoria River Downs]] was at one time the largest [[cattle station]] in the world. Gold was found at Grove Hill in 1872 and at [[Pine Creek, Northern Territory|Pine Creek]], Brocks Creek, Burundi, and copper was found at [[Daly River, Northern Territory|Daly River]].\n\nOn 1 January 1911, a decade after federation, the Northern Territory was separated from South Australia and transferred to federal control. [[Alfred Deakin]] opined at this time \"To me the question has been not so much commercial as national, first, second, third and last.

Soon after this time, parts of the Northern Territory were considered in the [[Kimberley Plan]] as a possible site for the establishment of a [[Jewish Homeland]], understandably considered the \"Un[[promised Land]]\".<ref>{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article18097828 |title=Wasted Years |newspaper=[[The Sydney Morning Herald]] |issue=34,577 |location=New South Wales, Australia |date=16 October 1948 |accessdate=20 July 2019 |page=6 |via=National Library of Australia}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article43802260 |title=Immigration Scheme That Failed |newspaper=[[The Advertiser (Adelaide)]] |volume=91 |issue=28178 |location=South Australia |date=29 January 1949 |accessdate=20 July 2019 |page=8 |via=National Library of Australia}}</ref>\n\nDuring World War II, most of the Top End was placed under military government. This is the only time since Federation that part of an Australian state or territory has been under military control. After the war, control for the entire area was handed back to the Commonwealth. The [[Bombing of Darwin]] occurred on 19 February 1942. It was the largest single attack ever mounted by a foreign power on Australia. Evidence of Darwin's World War II history is found at a variety of preserved sites in and around the city, including ammunition bunkers, airstrips, oil tunnels and museums. The port was damaged in the 1942 Japanese air raids. It was subsequently restored.\n\nIn the late 1960s improved roads in adjoining States linking with the territory, port delays and rapid economic development led to uncertainty in port and regional infrastructure development. As a result of the Commission of Enquiry established by the Administrator,<ref>[http://catalogue.nla.gov.au/Records/a590549]{{Dead link|date=July 2012}}</ref> port working arrangements were changed, berth investment deferred and a port masterplan prepared.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://catalogue.nla.gov.au/Record/2794315|title=Darwin and Northern Territory freight transport study|editor-first=|editor-last=Australia|date=30 April 1977|publisher=Australian Government Publishing Service|accessdate=30 April 2019|via=National Library of Australia (new catalog)}}</ref> Extension of rail transport was then not considered because of low freight volumes.\n\n[[Indigenous Australians]] had struggled for rights to fair wages and land. An important event in this struggle was the [[Gurindji strike|strike and walk off]] by the [[Gurindji people]] at [[Kalkaringi|Wave Hill Cattle Station]] in 1966. The federal government of [[Gough Whitlam#Prime Minister|Gough Whitlam]] set up [[Aboriginal Land Rights Commission|the Woodward Royal Commission]] in February 1973, which set to enquire into how land rights might be achieved in the Northern Territory. [[Philip Woodward (judge)|Justice Woodward]]'s first report in July 1973 recommended that a [[Central Land Council]] and a [[Northern Land Council]] be established to present to him the views of Aboriginal people. In response to the report of the Royal Commission a Land Rights Bill was drafted, but the Whitlam Government was dismissed before it was passed.\n\nThe [[Aboriginal Land Rights Act|Aboriginal Land Rights (Northern Territory) Act 1976]] was eventually passed by the [[Malcolm Fraser|Fraser]] government on 16 December 1976 and began operation on 26 January 1977).\n\nIn 1974, from Christmas Eve to Christmas Day, Darwin was devastated by tropical [[Cyclone Tracy]]. Cyclone Tracy killed 71 people, caused A$837 million in damage (1974 dollars), or approximately A$6.85 billion (2018 dollars),<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.rba.gov.au/calculator/annualDecimal.html|title=Inflation Calculator|access-date=19 July 2019|author=Reserve Bank of Australia}}</ref> and destroyed more than 70 per cent of Darwin's buildings, including 80 per cent of houses. Tracy left more than 41,000 out of the 47,000 inhabitants of the city homeless. The city was rebuilt with much-improved construction codes and is a modern, landscaped metropolis today.\n\nIn 1978 the territory was granted [[responsible government]], with a Legislative Assembly headed by a [[chief minister]]. The territory also publishes official notices in its own ''[[Northern Territory of Australia Government Gazette|Government Gazette]]''. The [[administrator of the Northern Territory]] is an official acting as the Queen's ''indirect'' representative in the territory.\n\nDuring 1995\u201396 the Northern Territory was briefly one of the few places in the world with [[Euthanasia in Australia#Legalisation in the Northern Territory|legal voluntary euthanasia]], until the Federal Parliament overturned [[Rights of the Terminally Ill Act 1995|the legislation]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nt.gov.au/lant/parliament/committees/rotti/parldebate.shtml|title=Select Committee on Euthanasia|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110302220134/http://nt.gov.au/lant/parliament/committees/rotti/parldebate.shtml|archivedate=2 March 2011|date=13 September 2007|publisher=Legislative Assembly of the Northern Territory}}</ref>\nBefore the over-riding legislation was enacted, four people used the law supported by Dr. [[Philip Nitschke]].\n\n==Geography==\n[[File:Northern Territory 0216.svg|thumb|right|Northern Territory towns, settlements and [[List of highways in the Northern Territory|road network]].]]\n{{main|Geography of the Northern Territory}}\n[[File:ISS036-E-029323 lrg.jpg|thumb|The northern coast of Australia is on the left with Melville Island in the lower right<ref>{{cite web|url=http://earthobservatory.nasa.gov/IOTD/view.php?id=81847 |title=Fires around Darwin, Australia August 21, 2013 |website=Earthobservatory.nasa.gov |date= |accessdate=2016-07-17}}</ref>]]\nThere are many very small settlements scattered across the territory, but the larger population centres are located on the single paved road that links Darwin to southern Australia, the [[Stuart Highway]], known to locals simply as \"the track\".\n\nThe Northern Territory is home to two spectacular natural rock formations, [[Uluru]] (Ayers Rock) and [[Kata Tjuta]] (The Olgas), which are sacred to the local Aboriginal peoples and which have become major tourist attractions.\n\nIn the northern part of the territory lies [[Kakadu National Park]], which features extensive [[wetland]]s and native wildlife. To the north of that lies the [[Arafura Sea]], and to the east lies [[Arnhem Land]], whose regional centre is [[Maningrida, Northern Territory|Maningrida]] on the Liverpool River delta.\nThere is an extensive series of river systems in the Northern Territory. These rivers include: the [[Alligator Rivers]], [[Daly River]], [[Finke River]], [[McArthur River]], [[Roper River]], [[Todd River]] and [[Victoria River (Northern Territory)|Victoria River]]. The Hay River is a river south-west of Alice Springs, with the Marshall River, Arthur Creek, Camel Creek and Bore Creek flowing into it.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bonzle.com/c/a?a=p&p=212462&cmd=sp|title=Hay River|website=Bonzle.com|accessdate=10 June 2019}}</ref>\n\n===National parks===\n{{Main|Protected areas of the Northern Territory}}\n{{see also|National parks of the Northern Territory}}\n{{div col|colwidth=20em}}\n* [[Arnhem Land]] (Restricted Area)\n* [[Barranyi (North Island) National Park]]\n* [[Casuarina, Northern Territory|Casuarina]] Coastal Reserve\n* [[Daly River]] Nature Park\n* [[Karlu Karlu / Devils Marbles Conservation Reserve]]\n* [[Djukbinj National Park]]\n* [[Dulcie Range National Park]]\n* [[Elsey National Park]]\n* [[Finke Gorge]] National Park\n* [[Gregory National Park]]\n* Gurig National Park-now [[Garig Gunak Barlu National Park]]\n* [[Howard Springs Nature Park]] Conservation Reserve\n* [[Iytwelepenty / Davenport Ranges National Park]]\n* [[Kakadu National Park]]\n* [[Karlu Karlu / Devils Marbles Conservation Reserve]]\n* [[Keep River National Park]]\n* [[Litchfield National Park]]\n* [[Mary River (Northern Territory)|Mary River]] Crossing Conservation Reserve and proposed [[Mary River National Park]]\n* [[Mataranka Hot Springs]]\n* [[Nitmiluk National Park]]\n* [[Katherine Gorge]]\n* [[Palm Valley (Northern Territory)|Palm Valley]]\n* [[Tanami Desert]]\n* [[The Olgas]]\n* [[Ulu\u1e5fu-Kata Tju\u1e6fa National Park]]\n* [[Watarrka National Park]] (including [[Kings Canyon, Northern Territory|Kings Canyon]])\n* [[West MacDonnell National Park]]\n{{div col end}}\n\n<gallery>\nFile:Mount Sonder.JPG|[[Mount Sonder]], the fourth-highest mountain in the Northern Territory after nearby [[Mount Zeil]], in [[West MacDonnell National Park]]\nFile:Kakadu 2488.jpg|[[Nourlangie Rock]] in [[Kakadu National Park]]\nFile:Jim jim falls.jpg|[[Jim Jim Falls]], Kakadu National Park\nFile:Uluru NT Australia.JPG|[[Uluru]] (Ayers Rock), one of the best-known images of the Northern Territory\nFile:Uluru, helicopter view, cropped.jpg|Aerial view of Uluru\n</gallery>\n\n[[File:Kata Tjuta pan.jpg|thumb|upright=3.75|center|Ulu\u1e5fu-Kata Tju\u1e6fa National Park]]\n\n===Climate===\n[[File:Northern Territory K\u00f6ppen.svg|thumb|[[K\u00f6ppen climate classification|K\u00f6ppen climate types]] in the Northern Territory]]\n[[File:Fires in Northern Territory, Australia.jpg|thumb|left|Satellite image of fire activity in central Australia]]\n\n{| class=\"toccolours\" cellpadding=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\" style=\"float:right; margin-right:.5em; margin-left:.50em; margin-top:.4em; font-size:90%;\"\n|-\n| colspan=\"5\"  style=\"background:#cef; text-align:center;\"| '''Average monthly maximum<br />temperature in Northern Territory'''\n|-  style=\"background:#ccc; vertical-align:top;\"\n!Month\n!Darwin\n!Alice Springs\n|-\n| style=\"text-align:left;\"|January\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|31.8&nbsp;\u00b0C\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|36.3&nbsp;\u00b0C\n|-\n| style=\"text-align:left;\"|February\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|31.4&nbsp;\u00b0C\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|35.1&nbsp;\u00b0C\n|-\n| style=\"text-align:left;\"|March\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|31.9&nbsp;\u00b0C\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|32.7&nbsp;\u00b0C\n|-\n| style=\"text-align:left;\"|April\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|32.7&nbsp;\u00b0C\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|28.2&nbsp;\u00b0C\n|-\n| style=\"text-align:left;\"|May\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|32.0&nbsp;\u00b0C\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|23.0&nbsp;\u00b0C\n|-\n| style=\"text-align:left;\"|June\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|30.6&nbsp;\u00b0C\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|19.8&nbsp;\u00b0C\n|-\n| style=\"text-align:left;\"|July\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|30.5&nbsp;\u00b0C\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|19.7&nbsp;\u00b0C\n|-\n| style=\"text-align:left;\"|August\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|31.3&nbsp;\u00b0C\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|22.6&nbsp;\u00b0C\n|-\n| style=\"text-align:left;\"|September\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|32.5&nbsp;\u00b0C\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|27.1&nbsp;\u00b0C\n|-\n| style=\"text-align:left;\"|October\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|33.2&nbsp;\u00b0C\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|30.9&nbsp;\u00b0C\n|-\n| style=\"text-align:left;\"|November\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|33.2&nbsp;\u00b0C\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|33.7&nbsp;\u00b0C\n|-\n| style=\"text-align:left;\"|December\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|32.6&nbsp;\u00b0C\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|35.4&nbsp;\u00b0C\n|-\n| colspan=\"5\"  style=\"font-size:80%; background:#cef; text-align:center;\"| Source: Bureau of Meteorology\n|}\n\nThe Northern Territory has two distinctive climate zones.\n\nThe northern end, including Darwin, has a tropical climate with high humidity and two seasons, the wet (October to April) and dry season (May to September). During the dry season nearly every day is warm and sunny, and afternoon humidity averages around 30%. There is very little rainfall between May and September. In the coolest months of June and July, the daily minimum temperature may dip as low as {{convert|14|C}}, but very rarely lower, and frost has never been recorded.\n\nThe wet season is associated with [[tropical cyclones]] and [[monsoon]] rains. The majority of rainfall occurs between December and March (the southern hemisphere summer), when [[thunderstorms]] are common and afternoon relative humidity averages over 70% during the wettest months. On average more than {{convert|1570|mm|abbr=on}} of rain falls in the north. Rainfall is highest in north-west coastal areas, where rainfall averages from {{convert|1800|to|2100|mm|abbr=on}}.\n\nThe central region is the [[desert]] centre of the country, which includes Alice Springs and [[Uluru]] (Ayers Rock), and is [[semi-arid]] with little rain usually falling during the hottest months from October to March.

Based on the [[Westminster System]], it consists of the [[Northern Territory Legislative Assembly]] which was created in 1974, replacing the [[Northern Territory Legislative Council]]. It also produces the [[Northern Territory of Australia Government Gazette]].\n\nThe Northern Territory Legislative Council was the partly elected governing body from 1947 until its replacement by the fully elected Northern Territory Legislative Assembly in 1974. The total enrolment for the 1947 election was 4,443. The Northern Territory was split into five electorates: Darwin, Alice Springs, Tennant Creek, Batchelor, and Stuart.\n\nWhile this assembly exercises powers similar to those of the parliaments of the states of Australia, it does so by legislated [[devolution]] of powers from the [[Government of Australia|Commonwealth Government]], rather than by any constitutional right. As such, the Commonwealth Government retains the right to legislate for the territory, including the power to override legislation passed by the Legislative Assembly. The [[Queen of Australia|Monarch]] is represented by the [[Administrator of the Northern Territory]], who performs a role similar to that of a [[governors of the Australian states|state governor]].\n\nTwenty-five members of the Legislative Assembly are elected to four-year terms from single-member [[Electoral district|electorates]].\n\nFor some years there has been [[Proposed Northern Territory statehood|agitation for full statehood]]. A [[1998 Northern Territory referendum|referendum]] of voters in the Northern Territory was held on the issue in 1998, which resulted in a 'no' vote. This was a shock to both the Northern Territory and Commonwealth governments, as opinion polls showed most Territorians supported statehood. But under the Australian Constitution, the federal government may set the terms of entry to full statehood. The Northern Territory was offered three senators, rather than the 12 guaranteed to original states. (Because of the difference in populations, equal numbers of Senate seats would mean a Territorian's vote for a senator would have been worth more than 30 votes in [[New South Wales]] or [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]].) Alongside what was cited as an arrogant approach adopted by then chief minister [[Shane Stone]], it is believed that most Territorians, regardless of their general views on statehood, were reluctant to adopt the particular offer that was made.<ref>{{cite video | title = ABC Lateline Discussion | url = http://www.abc.net.au/lateline/stories/s13445.htm | medium = Current Affairs | publisher = Australian Broadcasting Corporation | location = Australia | airdate = 15 October 1998 | access-date = 10 February 2007 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20060519013129/http://www.abc.net.au/lateline/stories/s13445.htm | archive-date = 19 May 2006 | url-status = dead | df = dmy-all }}</ref>\n\n===Chief minister and cabinet===\nThe [[Chief Minister of the Northern Territory|chief minister]] is the head of government of a self-governing territory (the head of a state government is a ''[[premier]]''). The chief minister is appointed by the [[administrator of the Northern Territory|administrator]], who in normal circumstances appoints the leader of whichever party holds the majority of seats in the Northern Territory Legislative Assembly. The current chief minister is [[Michael Gunner]] of the [[Australian Labor Party]]. He replaced [[Adam Giles]] on 31 August 2016.\n\n===Administrator===\nThe Northern Territory became self-governing on 1 July 1978 under its own [[administrator of the Northern Territory|administrator]] appointed by the [[Governor-General of Australia]]. The federal government, not the NT government, advises the governor-general on the appointment of the administrator, but by convention consults first with the Territory government. The current administrator is [[Vicki O'Halloran]].\n\n===Federal government===\n[[File:Children wave Australian flags during an Anzac Day parade in Palmerston, Australia, April 25, 2013, as U.S. Marines with the 1st Platoon, Lima Company, 3rd Battalion, 3rd Marine Regiment, Marine Rotational 130425-M-AL626-014.jpg|thumb|right|Children wave Australian flags during an [[Anzac Day]] parade in Palmerston]]\nThe Northern Territory is represented in the [[Parliament of Australia|federal parliament]] by two members in the House of Representatives and two members in the Senate. {{As of|2019|5}}, resulting from the [[2019 Australian federal election|2019 federal election]], [[Warren Snowdon]] from the [[Australian Labor Party]] (ALP) and [[Luke Gosling]] from the [[Australian Labor Party]] (ALP) serve in the House of Representatives, and [[Malarndirri McCarthy]] from the ALP and [[Sam McMahon]] from the [[Country Liberal Party]] serve in the Senate.\n\n===Local government===\nThe Northern Territory is divided into 17 [[Local government areas of the Northern Territory|local government areas]], including 11 shires and five municipalities. Shire, city and town councils are responsible for functions delegated by the Northern Territory parliament, such as road infrastructure and waste management. Council revenue comes mostly from property taxes and government grants.\n\n===Aboriginal land councils===\n[[File:Australia Aboriginal Culture 011.jpg|thumb|Aboriginal Australians own about 49% of the Northern Territory's land]]\n{{Further|Aboriginal land councils in the Northern Territory}}\n[[Aboriginal land council]]s in the Northern Territory are groups of Aboriginal landowners, set up under the ''[[Aboriginal Land Rights Act 1976]]''.\n\n=== Political parties ===\nThe two dominant political parties in the Northern Territory are the [[conservative]] [[Country Liberal Party]], and the [[Social democracy|social-democratic]] [[Australian Labor Party]]. Minor parties that are also active in the NT are the [[Northern Territory Greens]], [[Palmer United Party]] and [[Australia's First Nations Political Party]]. In the [[2016 Northern Territory general election]] only two CLP representatives were elected (MLAs Higgins and Finocchiaro) plus five independents. This makes the parliamentary status of the CLP as a major party a matter of conjecture.\n\n==Demographics==\n{{See also|Demographics of Australia}}\n[[File:ABS-3101.0-AustralianDemographicStatistics-EstimatedResidentPopulationStatesTerritories-EstimatedResidentPopulation-Persons-NorthernTerritory-A2060849W.svg|thumb|right|upright=1.5|Estimated resident population since 1981]]\n{| class=\"toccolours\" cellpadding=\"4\" cellspacing=\"0\" style=\"float:right; margin-left:.5em; font-size:90%;\"\n|-\n! colspan=\"2\"  style=\"background:#cef; text-align:center;\"| Population estimates<br />for the Northern Territory\n|-\n| style=\"text-align:right;\"| 1901 || style=\"text-align:center;\"| 4,765\n|-\n| style=\"text-align:right;\"| 1956 || style=\"text-align:center;\"| 19,556\n|-\n| style=\"text-align:right;\"| 1961 || style=\"text-align:center;\"| 44,481\n|-\n| style=\"text-align:right;\"| 1974 || style=\"text-align:center;\"| 102,924\n|-\n| style=\"text-align:right;\"| 1976 || style=\"text-align:center;\"| 97,090\n|-\n| style=\"text-align:right;\"| 1981 || style=\"text-align:center;\"| 122,616\n|-\n| style=\"text-align:right;\"| 1991 || style=\"text-align:center;\"| 165,493\n|-\n| style=\"text-align:right;\"| 1996 || style=\"text-align:center;\"| 181,843\n|-\n| style=\"text-align:right;\"| 2002 || style=\"text-align:center;\"| 200,019\n|-\n| style=\"text-align:right;\"| 2006 || style=\"text-align:center;\"| 192,900\n|-\n| style=\"text-align:right;\"| 2011 || style=\"text-align:center;\"| 211,945\n|-\n| style=\"text-align:right;\"| 2016 || style=\"text-align:center;\"| 228,833\n|-\n| colspan=\"2\"  style=\"font-size:80%; background:#cef; text-align:center;\"| Source: Australian Bureau of Statistics<br />(Est Resident Pop)\n|}\n\nThe population of the Northern Territory at the 2011 Australian census was 211,945,<ref name=2011census>[http://www.censusdata.abs.gov.au/census_services/getproduct/census/2011/quickstat/7?opendocument&navpos=220 2011 Census QuickStats: Northern Territory], Australian Bureau of Statistics, 9 August 2011.</ref> a 10 per cent increase from the 2006 census.

ABS statistics suggest that Indigenous Australians die about 11 years earlier than the average non-Indigenous Australian. There are Aboriginal communities in many parts of the territory, the largest ones being the [[Pitjantjatjara people|Pitjantjatjara]] near [[Uluru]], the [[Arrernte people|Arrernte]] near Alice Springs, the [[Luritja]] between those two, the [[Warlpiri people|Warlpiri]] further north, and the [[Yolngu]] in eastern [[Arnhem Land]].\n\nMore than 54% of Territorians live in Darwin, located in the territory's north ([[Top End]]).

It was entitled \"A Pilot Implementation of [[Internet]] access for Remote [[Aboriginal]] Communities in the \"[[Top End]]\" of Australia. Which involved implementing an internet and email access programmes, to the four remote aboriginal communities of Milikapiti, Port Keats (Karudu Numida), Titjikala and Pirlangimpi. The overall project was a success; however, it did expose some areas of concern, such as the lack line of quality in numerous communities throughout the territory. This resulted in an inability to provide internet services to these communities. An upgrade in telecommunications infrastructure was thought to be the answer to resolve this issue.\n\nA letter was sent to the [[Australian House of Representatives]] Communications, Information Technologies and the Arts Committee by Minister of Corporate and Information Services by [[Peter Toyne]] on 18 June 2002, enquiring into the opportunity of providing wireless technology to all Territorians. The letter highlighted the high cost of expanding the existing terrestrial broadband infrastructure (particularly in remote areas) and compared it to the fast and cheaper alternative of a wireless network. However, to be consider viable the wireless technology would have to be proven to be reliable and affordable to all Australians.\n\nThe Remote Areas Telecommunications Strategy for 2003\u20132008 was commended to the [[Commonwealth Government]] by Toyne. It focuses on delivering better telecommunication services to the indigenous residents of remote communities. It will also make such telecommunication services reliable and affordable, so that all Territorians have the ability and opportunity to partake in the information age. The government hopes to achieve these goals through the following strategies:\n* Equitable access: by delivering broadband services to remote communities, at the same cost of (within two years of introduction) the same Broadband services being provided in urban areas of Australia, and by developing infrastructure in one hundred and twenty remote communities throughout the Northern Territory. To provide quality large capacity telecommunication services to these areas over the five year period from 2003 to 2008.\n* Driving Demand: By providing education on consumer rights and responsibilities to the indigenous residents of remote communities. Targeting the indigenous residents of these remote communities by providing culturally appropriate content and applications. Also by improving private sector and government services to these remote communities.\n* Partnerships: Securing funding Territory wide to provide solutions to telecommunication infrastructure. Collaborating with indigenous organisations to develop, culturally appropriate content and applications, which will be utilised in the remote communities.\n* Efficient Delivery: Reducing the telecommunications cost to government, by forming agreements with local and remote community councils. Combining their access and demand needs to provide affordable telecommunication services.\n* Community Delivery: By supplying constant assistance in the remote communities by way of an entity or organisation, that assists the residents of the communities with any problems or issues. This entity or organisation could also liaise with the government, private sector and telecommunications organisations.\n\n# 4. An article in the N.T. Business review dated 13 December 2007 by [[Anastasia Govan]]. Entitled \"Broadband debate the key to NT's future\". In which Govan writes\" Despite all the noise about broadband during the weeks of the recent federal election, high speed telecommunications remain an elusive pipe dream for most of the Northern Territory\" (2007 p.007) Broadband debate key to NT's future. The article addresses the fact that the residents of remote Territory communities (most of whom are indigenous Australians) have little or no ability to access basic internet services. Such internet services are readily available in other states and taken for granted by most Australians. The gap in the quality of telecommunication services provided to the remote communities (if any in some cases), compared to the standard provided\n\nIn metropolitan areas of Australia is only getting bigger. To rectify this problem a strategy utilising both optical and wireless technologies is needed. To delivery these high speed broadband services to all Australians. As Govan (2007 p.007) (Broadband key to NT's future) states \"This issue must be addressed in the next six to two months if we are to maintain our global Competitiveness\". Australian's reputation as a nation of innovators and problem solvers is in peril, unless changes to telecommunication infrastructure are created and implemented.-->\n\n==Sport==\n{{main|Sport in the Northern Territory}}\n\n==See also==\n* [[Australian Aboriginal prehistoric sites]]\n* [[Crime in the Northern Territory]]\n* [[Index of Australia-related articles]]\n* [[Juvenile detention in the Northern Territory]]\n* [[Northern Territory Police]]\n* [[List of highways in the Northern Territory]]\n* [[:Category:Cities in the Northern Territory]]\n* [[:Category:Towns in the Northern Territory]]\n\n==Notes==\n{{reflist|group=N}}\n\n== References ==\n\n=== Citations ===\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n=== Sources ===\n* Hill, Ernestine. 1951.

To the north, the territory looks out to the [[Timor Sea]], the [[Arafura Sea]] and the [[Gulf of Carpentaria]], including [[Western New Guinea]] and other [[Indonesia]]n islands. The NT covers {{convert|1349129|km2|0}}, making it the third-largest Australian federal division, and [[List of country subdivisions by area|the 11th-largest country subdivision in the world]]. It is sparsely populated, with a population of only 245,800,<ref name=ABSPop/> fewer than half as many people as [[Tasmania]].<ref name=ABSPop/>\n\nThe archaeological [[history of the Northern Territory]] begins over 40,000 years ago when [[Indigenous Australians]] settled the region. [[Makassan contact with Australia|Makassan traders]] began trading with the indigenous people of the Northern Territory for [[Sea cucumber (food)|trepang]] from at least the 18th century onwards. The coast of the territory was first seen by Europeans in the 17th century. The British were the first Europeans to attempt to settle the coastal regions. After three failed attempts to establish a settlement (1824\u201328, 1838\u201349, and 1864\u201366), success was achieved in 1869 with the establishment of a settlement at [[Darwin, Northern Territory|Port Darwin]]. Today the economy is based on tourism, especially [[Kakadu National Park]] in the [[Top End]] and the [[Ulu\u1e5fu-Kata Tju\u1e6fa National Park]] (Ayers Rock) in central Australia, and mining.\n\nThe capital and largest city is [[Darwin, Northern Territory|Darwin]]. The population is concentrated in coastal regions and along the [[Stuart Highway]]. The other major settlements are (in order of size) [[Palmerston, Northern Territory|Palmerston]], [[Alice Springs]], [[Katherine, Northern Territory|Katherine]], [[Nhulunbuy]] and [[Tennant Creek]]. Residents of the Northern Territory are often known simply as \"Territorians\" and fully as \"Northern Territorians\", or more informally as \"Top Enders\" and \"Centralians\".\n\n==History==\n[[File:Thomas Baines, Thomas Baines with Aborigines near the mouth of the Victoria River, N.T, 1857.jpg|thumb|left|[[Thomas Baines]] with Aborigines near the mouth of the [[Victoria River (Northern Territory)|Victoria River]].]]\n{{main|History of the Northern Territory}}\n[[Indigenous Australians]] have lived in the present area of the Northern Territory for at least 65,000 years,<ref name=\"Clarkson Jacobs Marwick Fullagar 2017 pp. 306\u2013310\">{{cite journal | last=Clarkson | first=Chris | last2=Jacobs | first2=Zenobia | last3=Marwick | first3=Ben | last4=Fullagar | first4=Richard | last5=Wallis | first5=Lynley | last6=Smith | first6=Mike | last7=Roberts | first7=Richard G. | last8=Hayes | first8=Elspeth | last9=Lowe | first9=Kelsey | last10=Carah | first10=Xavier | last11=Florin | first11=S.

The land now occupied by the Northern Territory was part of colonial [[New South Wales]] from 1825 to 1863, except for a brief time from February to December 1846, when it was part of the short-lived colony of [[North Australia]]. The Northern Territory was part of South Australia from 1863 to 1911. Under the administration of colonial South Australia, the [[Australian Overland Telegraph Line|overland telegraph]] was constructed between 1870 and 1872.\n\nFrom its establishment in 1869 the Port of Darwin was the major Territory supply for many decades.\n\nA railway was built between [[Palmerston, Northern Territory|Palmerston]] and [[Pine Creek, Northern Territory|Pine Creek]] between 1883 and 1889. The economic pattern of cattle raising and mining was established so that by 1911 there were 513,000 cattle. [[Victoria River Downs Station|Victoria River Downs]] was at one time the largest [[cattle station]] in the world. Gold was found at Grove Hill in 1872 and at [[Pine Creek, Northern Territory|Pine Creek]], Brocks Creek, Burundi, and copper was found at [[Daly River, Northern Territory|Daly River]].\n\nOn 1 January 1911, a decade after federation, the Northern Territory was separated from South Australia and transferred to federal control. [[Alfred Deakin]] opined at this time \"To me the question has been not so much commercial as national, first, second, third and last.

This is the only time since Federation that part of an Australian state or territory has been under military control. After the war, control for the entire area was handed back to the Commonwealth. The [[Bombing of Darwin]] occurred on 19 February 1942. It was the largest single attack ever mounted by a foreign power on Australia. Evidence of Darwin's World War II history is found at a variety of preserved sites in and around the city, including ammunition bunkers, airstrips, oil tunnels and museums. The port was damaged in the 1942 Japanese air raids. It was subsequently restored.\n\nIn the late 1960s improved roads in adjoining States linking with the territory, port delays and rapid economic development led to uncertainty in port and regional infrastructure development. As a result of the Commission of Enquiry established by the Administrator,<ref>[http://catalogue.nla.gov.au/Records/a590549]{{Dead link|date=July 2012}}</ref> port working arrangements were changed, berth investment deferred and a port masterplan prepared.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://catalogue.nla.gov.au/Record/2794315|title=Darwin and Northern Territory freight transport study|editor-first=|editor-last=Australia|date=30 April 1977|publisher=Australian Government Publishing Service|accessdate=30 April 2019|via=National Library of Australia (new catalog)}}</ref> Extension of rail transport was then not considered because of low freight volumes.\n\n[[Indigenous Australians]] had struggled for rights to fair wages and land. An important event in this struggle was the [[Gurindji strike|strike and walk off]] by the [[Gurindji people]] at [[Kalkaringi|Wave Hill Cattle Station]] in 1966. The federal government of [[Gough Whitlam#Prime Minister|Gough Whitlam]] set up [[Aboriginal Land Rights Commission|the Woodward Royal Commission]] in February 1973, which set to enquire into how land rights might be achieved in the Northern Territory. [[Philip Woodward (judge)|Justice Woodward]]'s first report in July 1973 recommended that a [[Central Land Council]] and a [[Northern Land Council]] be established to present to him the views of Aboriginal people. In response to the report of the Royal Commission a Land Rights Bill was drafted, but the Whitlam Government was dismissed before it was passed.\n\nThe [[Aboriginal Land Rights Act|Aboriginal Land Rights (Northern Territory) Act 1976]] was eventually passed by the [[Malcolm Fraser|Fraser]] government on 16 December 1976 and began operation on 26 January 1977).\n\nIn 1974, from Christmas Eve to Christmas Day, Darwin was devastated by tropical [[Cyclone Tracy]]. Cyclone Tracy killed 71 people, caused A$837 million in damage (1974 dollars), or approximately A$6.85 billion (2018 dollars),<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.rba.gov.au/calculator/annualDecimal.html|title=Inflation Calculator|access-date=19 July 2019|author=Reserve Bank of Australia}}</ref> and destroyed more than 70 per cent of Darwin's buildings, including 80 per cent of houses. Tracy left more than 41,000 out of the 47,000 inhabitants of the city homeless. The city was rebuilt with much-improved construction codes and is a modern, landscaped metropolis today.\n\nIn 1978 the territory was granted [[responsible government]], with a Legislative Assembly headed by a [[chief minister]]. The territory also publishes official notices in its own ''[[Northern Territory of Australia Government Gazette|Government Gazette]]''. The [[administrator of the Northern Territory]] is an official acting as the Queen's ''indirect'' representative in the territory.\n\nDuring 1995\u201396 the Northern Territory was briefly one of the few places in the world with [[Euthanasia in Australia#Legalisation in the Northern Territory|legal voluntary euthanasia]], until the Federal Parliament overturned [[Rights of the Terminally Ill Act 1995|the legislation]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nt.gov.au/lant/parliament/committees/rotti/parldebate.shtml|title=Select Committee on Euthanasia|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110302220134/http://nt.gov.au/lant/parliament/committees/rotti/parldebate.shtml|archivedate=2 March 2011|date=13 September 2007|publisher=Legislative Assembly of the Northern Territory}}</ref>\nBefore the over-riding legislation was enacted, four people used the law supported by Dr. [[Philip Nitschke]].\n\n==Geography==\n[[File:Northern Territory 0216.svg|thumb|right|Northern Territory towns, settlements and [[List of highways in the Northern Territory|road network]].]]\n{{main|Geography of the Northern Territory}}\n[[File:ISS036-E-029323 lrg.jpg|thumb|The northern coast of Australia is on the left with Melville Island in the lower right<ref>{{cite web|url=http://earthobservatory.nasa.gov/IOTD/view.php?id=81847 |title=Fires around Darwin, Australia August 21, 2013 |website=Earthobservatory.nasa.gov |date= |accessdate=2016-07-17}}</ref>]]\nThere are many very small settlements scattered across the territory, but the larger population centres are located on the single paved road that links Darwin to southern Australia, the [[Stuart Highway]], known to locals simply as \"the track\".\n\nThe Northern Territory is home to two spectacular natural rock formations, [[Uluru]] (Ayers Rock) and [[Kata Tjuta]] (The Olgas), which are sacred to the local Aboriginal peoples and which have become major tourist attractions.\n\nIn the northern part of the territory lies [[Kakadu National Park]], which features extensive [[wetland]]s and native wildlife. To the north of that lies the [[Arafura Sea]], and to the east lies [[Arnhem Land]], whose regional centre is [[Maningrida, Northern Territory|Maningrida]] on the Liverpool River delta.\nThere is an extensive series of river systems in the Northern Territory. These rivers include: the [[Alligator Rivers]], [[Daly River]], [[Finke River]], [[McArthur River]], [[Roper River]], [[Todd River]] and [[Victoria River (Northern Territory)|Victoria River]].

During the dry season nearly every day is warm and sunny, and afternoon humidity averages around 30%. There is very little rainfall between May and September. In the coolest months of June and July, the daily minimum temperature may dip as low as {{convert|14|C}}, but very rarely lower, and frost has never been recorded.\n\nThe wet season is associated with [[tropical cyclones]] and [[monsoon]] rains. The majority of rainfall occurs between December and March (the southern hemisphere summer), when [[thunderstorms]] are common and afternoon relative humidity averages over 70% during the wettest months. On average more than {{convert|1570|mm|abbr=on}} of rain falls in the north. Rainfall is highest in north-west coastal areas, where rainfall averages from {{convert|1800|to|2100|mm|abbr=on}}.\n\nThe central region is the [[desert]] centre of the country, which includes Alice Springs and [[Uluru]] (Ayers Rock), and is [[semi-arid]] with little rain usually falling during the hottest months from October to March. Seasons are more distinct in central Australia, with very hot summers and cool winters. Frost is recorded a few times a year. The region receives less than {{convert|250|mm|abbr=on}} of rain per year.\n\nThe highest temperature recorded in the territory was {{convert|48.3|C}} at [[Aputula, Northern Territory|Finke]] on 1 and 2 January 1960.

Based on the [[Westminster System]], it consists of the [[Northern Territory Legislative Assembly]] which was created in 1974, replacing the [[Northern Territory Legislative Council]]. It also produces the [[Northern Territory of Australia Government Gazette]].\n\nThe Northern Territory Legislative Council was the partly elected governing body from 1947 until its replacement by the fully elected Northern Territory Legislative Assembly in 1974. The total enrolment for the 1947 election was 4,443. The Northern Territory was split into five electorates: Darwin, Alice Springs, Tennant Creek, Batchelor, and Stuart.\n\nWhile this assembly exercises powers similar to those of the parliaments of the states of Australia, it does so by legislated [[devolution]] of powers from the [[Government of Australia|Commonwealth Government]], rather than by any constitutional right. As such, the Commonwealth Government retains the right to legislate for the territory, including the power to override legislation passed by the Legislative Assembly. The [[Queen of Australia|Monarch]] is represented by the [[Administrator of the Northern Territory]], who performs a role similar to that of a [[governors of the Australian states|state governor]].\n\nTwenty-five members of the Legislative Assembly are elected to four-year terms from single-member [[Electoral district|electorates]].\n\nFor some years there has been [[Proposed Northern Territory statehood|agitation for full statehood]]. A [[1998 Northern Territory referendum|referendum]] of voters in the Northern Territory was held on the issue in 1998, which resulted in a 'no' vote. This was a shock to both the Northern Territory and Commonwealth governments, as opinion polls showed most Territorians supported statehood. But under the Australian Constitution, the federal government may set the terms of entry to full statehood. The Northern Territory was offered three senators, rather than the 12 guaranteed to original states. (Because of the difference in populations, equal numbers of Senate seats would mean a Territorian's vote for a senator would have been worth more than 30 votes in [[New South Wales]] or [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]].) Alongside what was cited as an arrogant approach adopted by then chief minister [[Shane Stone]], it is believed that most Territorians, regardless of their general views on statehood, were reluctant to adopt the particular offer that was made.<ref>{{cite video | title = ABC Lateline Discussion | url = http://www.abc.net.au/lateline/stories/s13445.htm | medium = Current Affairs | publisher = Australian Broadcasting Corporation | location = Australia | airdate = 15 October 1998 | access-date = 10 February 2007 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20060519013129/http://www.abc.net.au/lateline/stories/s13445.htm | archive-date = 19 May 2006 | url-status = dead | df = dmy-all }}</ref>\n\n===Chief minister and cabinet===\nThe [[Chief Minister of the Northern Territory|chief minister]] is the head of government of a self-governing territory (the head of a state government is a ''[[premier]]'').

It was entitled \"A Pilot Implementation of [[Internet]] access for Remote [[Aboriginal]] Communities in the \"[[Top End]]\" of Australia. Which involved implementing an internet and email access programmes, to the four remote aboriginal communities of Milikapiti, Port Keats (Karudu Numida), Titjikala and Pirlangimpi. The overall project was a success; however, it did expose some areas of concern, such as the lack line of quality in numerous communities throughout the territory. This resulted in an inability to provide internet services to these communities. An upgrade in telecommunications infrastructure was thought to be the answer to resolve this issue.\n\nA letter was sent to the [[Australian House of Representatives]] Communications, Information Technologies and the Arts Committee by Minister of Corporate and Information Services by [[Peter Toyne]] on 18 June 2002, enquiring into the opportunity of providing wireless technology to all Territorians. The letter highlighted the high cost of expanding the existing terrestrial broadband infrastructure (particularly in remote areas) and compared it to the fast and cheaper alternative of a wireless network. However, to be consider viable the wireless technology would have to be proven to be reliable and affordable to all Australians.\n\nThe Remote Areas Telecommunications Strategy for 2003\u20132008 was commended to the [[Commonwealth Government]] by Toyne. It focuses on delivering better telecommunication services to the indigenous residents of remote communities. It will also make such telecommunication services reliable and affordable, so that all Territorians have the ability and opportunity to partake in the information age. The government hopes to achieve these goals through the following strategies:\n* Equitable access: by delivering broadband services to remote communities, at the same cost of (within two years of introduction) the same Broadband services being provided in urban areas of Australia, and by developing infrastructure in one hundred and twenty remote communities throughout the Northern Territory. To provide quality large capacity telecommunication services to these areas over the five year period from 2003 to 2008.\n* Driving Demand: By providing education on consumer rights and responsibilities to the indigenous residents of remote communities. Targeting the indigenous residents of these remote communities by providing culturally appropriate content and applications. Also by improving private sector and government services to these remote communities.\n* Partnerships: Securing funding Territory wide to provide solutions to telecommunication infrastructure. Collaborating with indigenous organisations to develop, culturally appropriate content and applications, which will be utilised in the remote communities.\n* Efficient Delivery: Reducing the telecommunications cost to government, by forming agreements with local and remote community councils. Combining their access and demand needs to provide affordable telecommunication services.\n* Community Delivery: By supplying constant assistance in the remote communities by way of an entity or organisation, that assists the residents of the communities with any problems or issues. This entity or organisation could also liaise with the government, private sector and telecommunications organisations.\n\n# 4. An article in the N.T. Business review dated 13 December 2007 by [[Anastasia Govan]]. Entitled \"Broadband debate the key to NT's future\". In which Govan writes\" Despite all the noise about broadband during the weeks of the recent federal election, high speed telecommunications remain an elusive pipe dream for most of the Northern Territory\" (2007 p.007) Broadband debate key to NT's future. The article addresses the fact that the residents of remote Territory communities (most of whom are indigenous Australians) have little or no ability to access basic internet services. Such internet services are readily available in other states and taken for granted by most Australians. The gap in the quality of telecommunication services provided to the remote communities (if any in some cases), compared to the standard provided\n\nIn metropolitan areas of Australia is only getting bigger. To rectify this problem a strategy utilising both optical and wireless technologies is needed. To delivery these high speed broadband services to all Australians. As Govan (2007 p.007) (Broadband key to NT's future) states \"This issue must be addressed in the next six to two months if we are to maintain our global Competitiveness\". Australian's reputation as a nation of innovators and problem solvers is in peril, unless changes to telecommunication infrastructure are created and implemented.-->\n\n==Sport==\n{{main|Sport in the Northern Territory}}\n\n==See also==\n* [[Australian Aboriginal prehistoric sites]]\n* [[Crime in the Northern Territory]]\n* [[Index of Australia-related articles]]\n* [[Juvenile detention in the Northern Territory]]\n* [[Northern Territory Police]]\n* [[List of highways in the Northern Territory]]\n* [[:Category:Cities in the Northern Territory]]\n* [[:Category:Towns in the Northern Territory]]\n\n==Notes==\n{{reflist|group=N}}\n\n== References ==\n\n=== Citations ===\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n=== Sources ===\n* Hill, Ernestine. 1951.

He was educated at [[Gresham's School]], [[Holt, Norfolk|Holt]], where he first encountered [[W. H. Auden]], [[Benjamin Britten]], and [[Humphrey Spender]]. He left school in 1925 at the age of sixteen, and spent several years working as an estate agent and studying to become a surveyor.

According to Watkins et al., stuttering is a disorder of \"selection, initiation, and execution of motor sequences necessary for fluent speech production\".<ref name=\"Carlson, N. 2013 pp. 497-500\">[Carlson, N. (2013). Human Communication. In Physiology of behavior (11th ed., pp. 497\u2013500). Boston: Allyn and Bacon.]</ref> For many people who stutter, repetition is the main problem. The term \"stuttering\" covers a wide range of severity, encompassing barely perceptible impediments that are largely cosmetic to severe [[symptoms]] that effectively prevent [[oral communication]]. In the world, approximately four times as many men as women stutter, encompassing 70 million people worldwide,<ref>{{cite web|title=11 Facts About Stuttering|url=https://www.dosomething.org/tipsandtools/11-facts-about-stuttering|access-date=15 July 2014|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140719081755/https://www.dosomething.org/tipsandtools/11-facts-about-stuttering|archive-date=19 July 2014|df=}}</ref> or about 1% of the world's population.<ref name=\"Carlson, N. 2013 pp. 497-500\"/>\n\nThe impact of stuttering on a person's functioning and emotional state can be severe. This may include fears of having to [[elocution|enunciate]] specific vowels or consonants, fears of being caught stuttering in social situations, self-imposed isolation, anxiety, stress, shame, low self-esteem, being a possible target of bullying (especially in children), having to use word substitution and rearrange words in a sentence to hide stuttering, or a feeling of \"loss of control\" during speech. Stuttering is sometimes popularly seen as a symptom of anxiety, but there is actually no direct correlation in that direction (though as mentioned the inverse can be true, as social anxiety may actually develop in individuals as a result of their stuttering).<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.stammering.org/speaking-out/articles/what-relationship-between-stuttering-and-anxiety|title=What is the relationship between stuttering and anxiety? {{!}} British Stammering Association|website=www.stammering.org|access-date=2019-03-20|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170423073752/http://stammering.org/speaking-out/articles/what-relationship-between-stuttering-and-anxiety|archive-date=2017-04-23|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\nStuttering is generally not a problem with the physical production of speech sounds or putting thoughts into words. Acute nervousness and stress are not thought to cause stuttering, but they can trigger stuttering in people who have the speech disorder, and living with a stigmatized disability can result in [[anxiety (mood)|anxiety]] and high [[Allostatic load|allostatic stress load]] (chronic nervousness and stress) that reduce the amount of acute stress necessary to trigger stuttering in any given person who stutters, worsening the problem in the manner of a [[positive feedback]] system; the name 'stuttered speech syndrome' has been proposed for this condition.<ref>http://www.stutteredspeechsyndrome.com {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110208102736/http://stutteredspeechsyndrome.com/ |date=2011-02-08 }}</ref><ref>{{cite book|last=Irwin|first=M.|editor1-first=J.|editor1-last=Au-Yeung|editor2-first=M.

Stutterers often find that their stuttering fluctuates and that they have \"good\" days, \"bad\" days and \"stutter-free\" days.

In stuttering, it is seen that many individuals do not demonstrate disfluencies when it comes to tasks that allow for automatic processing without substantial planning. For example, singing \"Happy Birthday\" or other relatively common, repeated linguistic discourses, could be fluid in people who stutter.  Tasks like this reduce semantic, syntactic, and prosodic planning, whereas spontaneous, \"controlled\" speech or reading aloud requires thoughts to transform into linguistic material and thereafter [[syntax]] and [[prosody (linguistics)|prosody]].  Some researchers hypothesize that controlled-language activated circuitry consistently does not function properly in people who stutter, whereas people who do not stutter only sometimes display disfluent speech and abnormal circuitry.<ref name=\"Department of Psychology, and Center for the Neural Basis of Cognition, University of Pittsburgh, PA 15260, USA.\">{{cite journal|doi=10.1016/s0140-6736(00)02547-2 |pmid=10981883|last=Sandak|first=R|title=Stuttering: a view from neuroimaging|volume=356|issue=9228|journal=The Lancet|pages=445\u2013446|year=2000}}</ref>\n\n==Causes==\nNo single, exclusive cause of developmental stuttering is known.

This view is held for the following reasons. It always arises from repetition of sounds or words. Young children like repetition and the more tense they are feeling, the more they like this outlet for their tension \u2013 an understandable and quite normal reaction. They are capable of repeating all types of behaviour. The more tension that is felt, the less one likes change. The more change, the greater can be the repetition. So, when a 3 year old finds he has a new baby brother or sister he may start repeating sounds. The repetitions can become conditioned and automatic and ensuing struggles against the repetitions result in prolongations and blocks in his speech. More boys stammer than girls, in the ratio of 3\u20134 boys : 1 girl. This is because the male [[Hypothalamic\u2013pituitary\u2013adrenal axis|Hypothalamic-Pituitary-Adrenal (HPA) Axis]] is more active. Whilst they are pumping out more [[cortisol]] than females under the same provocation, they can be tense or anxious and become repetitive.<ref>Stammering (Stuttering) A Complex Vocal Tic, Patricia Sims, Kindle version 2014</ref>\n\nIn a 2010 article, three genes were found by [[Dennis Drayna]] and team to correlate with stuttering: [[GNPTAB]], [[GNPTG]], and [[NAGPA]].

Research is complicated somewhat by the possibility that such differences could be the consequences of stuttering rather than a cause, but recent research on older children confirms structural differences thereby giving strength to the argument that at least some of the differences are not a consequence of stuttering.<ref name=\"watkins\">{{cite journal |vauthors=Watkins KE, Smith SM, Davis S, Howell P |title=Structural and functional abnormalities of the motor system in developmental stuttering |journal=Brain |volume=131 |issue=Pt 1 |pages=50\u20139 |date=January 2008  |pmid=17928317 |pmc=2492392 |doi=10.1093/brain/awm241}}</ref><ref name=\"chang\">{{cite journal |author= Soo-Eun, Chang|title= Brain anatomy differences in childhood stuttering |journal=[[NeuroImage (journal)|NeuroImage]] |year=2007 |ref= harv }}</ref>\n\nAuditory processing deficits have also been proposed as a cause of stuttering. Stuttering is less prevalent in deaf and hard-of-hearing individuals,<ref>{{harvnb|Ward|2006|pp= 46\u20137}}</ref> and stuttering may be reduced when auditory feedback is altered, such as by [[Auditory masking|masking]], [[delayed auditory feedback]] (DAF), or frequency altered feedback.<ref name=\"gordon\"/><ref>{{harvnb|Ward|2006|p= 58}}</ref> There is some evidence that the functional organization of the auditory cortex may be different in people who stutter.<ref name=\"gordon\"/>\n\nThere is evidence of differences in linguistic processing between people who stutter and people who do not stutter.<ref>{{harvnb|Ward|2006|p= 43}}</ref> Brain scans of adult people who stutter have found increased activation of the right hemisphere, which is associated with emotions, than in the left hemisphere, which is associated with speech. In addition, reduced activation in the left auditory cortex has been observed.<ref name=\"gordon\"/><ref name=\"Guitar66\"/>\n\nThe ''capacities and demands'' model has been proposed to account for the heterogeneity of the disorder. In this approach, speech performance varies depending on the ''capacity'' that the individual has for producing fluent speech, and the ''demands'' placed upon the person by the speaking situation. Capacity for fluent speech may be affected by a predisposition to the disorder, auditory processing or motor speech deficits, and [[Cognition|cognitive]] or [[Affect (psychology)|affective]] issues. Demands may be increased by internal factors such as lack of confidence or [[Self-esteem|self esteem]] or inadequate language skills or external factors such as [[peer pressure]], time pressure, stressful speaking situations, insistence on perfect speech, and the like. In stuttering, the severity of the disorder is seen as likely to increase when demands placed on the person's speech and language system exceed their capacity to deal with these pressures.<ref>{{harvnb|Ward|2006|pp= 16\u201321}}</ref> However, the precise nature of the capacity or incapacity has not been delineated.\n\n==Mechanism==\n\n===Physiology===\nThough neuroimaging studies have not yet found specific neural correlates, there is much evidence that the brains of adults who stutter differ from the brains of adults who do not stutter. Several neuroimaging studies have emerged to identify areas associated with stuttering.  In general, during stuttering, cerebral activities change dramatically in comparison to silent rest or fluent speech between people who stutter and people who do not stutter. There is evidence that people who stutter activate motor programs before the articulatory or linguistic processing is initiated. Brain imaging studies have primarily been focused on adults. However, the neurological abnormalities found in adults does not determine whether childhood stuttering caused these abnormalities or whether the abnormalities cause stuttering.<ref name=watkins />\n\nStudies utilizing [[positron emission tomography]] (PET) have found during tasks that invoke disfluent speech, people who stutter show [[hypoactivity]] in cortical areas associated with language processing, such as [[Broca's area]], but hyperactivity in areas associated with motor function.<ref name=\"Department of Psychology, and Center for the Neural Basis of Cognition, University of Pittsburgh, PA 15260, USA.\" />  One such study that evaluated the stutter period found that there was over activation in the cerebrum and cerebellum, and relative deactivation of the left hemisphere auditory areas and frontal temporal regions.<ref name=\":4\">{{Cite book|title=A handbook on stuttering|last=Bloodstein|first=Oliver|last2=Ratner|first2=Nan Bernstein|publisher=Cengage Learning|year=2007|isbn=978-1418042035|location=|pages=142}}</ref>\n\n[[Functional magnetic resonance imaging]] (fMRI) has found abnormal activation in the right frontal operculum (RFO), which is an area associated with time-estimation tasks, occasionally incorporated in complex speech.<ref name=\"Department of Psychology, and Center for the Neural Basis of Cognition, University of Pittsburgh, PA 15260, USA.\" />\n\nResearchers have explored temporal cortical activations by utilizing [[magnetoencephalography]] (MEG).

Children and adults are monitored and evaluated for evidence of possible social, psychological or emotional signs of stress related to their disorder. Some common assessments of this type measure factors including: anxiety (Endler multidimensional anxiety scales (EMAS)), attitudes (personal report of communication apprehension (PRCA)), perceptions of self (stutterers\u2019 self-rating of reactions to speech situations (SSRSS)), quality of life (overall assessment of the speaker's experience of stuttering (OASES)), behaviors (older adult self-report (OASR)), and mental health (composite international diagnostic interview (CIDI)).<ref>[http://www.latrobe.edu.au/health/downloads/star-stutteringresource.pdfLa Trobe University School of Human Communication Disorders]</ref>\n\nThe SLP will then attempt to combine the information garnered from the client's case study along with the information acquired from the assessments in order to make a final decision regarding the existence of a fluency disorder and determine the best course of treatment for the client.\n\nStuttering can also diagnosed per the DSM-5 diagnostic codes<ref>American Psychiatric Association. (2013). Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders (5th ed.). Washington, DC: Author.</ref> by clinical psychologists with adequate expertise.  The most recent version of the DSM-5 describes this speech disorder as \"Childhood-Onset Fluency Disorder (Stuttering)\" for developmental stuttering, and \"Adult-onset Fluency Disorder\".  However, the specific rationale for this change from the DSM-IV is ill-documented in the APA's published literature, and is felt by some to promote confusion between the very different terms \"fluency\" and \"disfluency\".\n\n===Normal disfluency===\n{{Main|Developmental dysfluency}}\nNormal disfluency should be ruled out before diagnosing stuttering.<ref>Ambrose, Nicoline Grinager, and Ehud Yairi. \"Normative Disfluency Data for Early Childhood Stuttering.\" ''Journal of Speech, Language, and Hearing Research'' 42, no. 4 (1999): 895-909. https://doi.org/10.1044/jslhr.4204.895 (\"Stuttering is shown to be qualitatively as well as quantitatively different from normal disfluency even at the earliest stages of stuttering.\")</ref> Many toddlers and preschool age children stutter as they are learning to talk, and although many parents worry about it, most of these children will outgrow the stuttering and will have normal speech as they get older. Since most of these children do not stutter after the preschool years, this normal stage of speech development is usually referred to as ''normal disfluency'' or ''developmental dysfluency''. As children learn to talk, they may repeat certain sounds, stumble on or mispronounce words, hesitate between words, substitute sounds for each other, and be unable to express some sounds. Young children learning to talk exhibit brief repetitions of certain sounds, syllables or short words, however, this normal dysfluency gradually dissipates as the child matures.\n\n===Classification===\nDevelopmental stuttering is stuttering that originates when a child is learning to speak and develops as the child matures into adulthood.\n\nOther disorders with symptoms resembling stuttering include [[autism]], [[cluttering]], [[Parkinson's disease]], [[essential tremor]], [[palilalia]], [[spasmodic dysphonia]], [[selective mutism]], and [[social anxiety]].\n\n====Developmental====\nStuttering is typically a [[developmental disorder]] beginning in early childhood and continuing into adulthood in at least 20% of affected children.<ref name=\"gordon\">{{cite journal |author=Gordon, N. |title=Stuttering: incidence and causes |journal=Developmental Medicine & Child Neurology |volume=44 |issue=4 |pages=278\u201381 |year=2002 |pmid=11995897 |doi = 10.1017/S0012162201002067 |ref=harv}}</ref><ref name=\"craig2005\">{{cite journal|author1= Craig, A.|author2= Tran, Y.|title=The epidemiology of stuttering: The need for reliable estimates of prevalence and anxiety levels over the lifespan|journal= Advances in Speech\u2013Language Pathology |volume=7 |issue=1 |pages=41\u201346 |year=2005 |ref= harv |doi= 10.1080/14417040500055060}}</ref> The mean onset of stuttering is 30 months.<ref name=\"fn 30\"/> Although there is variability, early stuttering behaviours usually consist of word or syllable repetitions, while secondary behaviours such as tension, avoidance or escape behaviours are absent.<ref name=\"Ward13\">{{harvnb|Ward|2006|p=13}}</ref> Most young children are unaware of the interruptions in their speech.<ref name=\"Ward13\"/> With young stutterers, disfluency may be episodic, and periods of stuttering are followed by periods of relatively decreased disfluency.<ref>{{harvnb|Ward|2006|pp=114\u20135}}</ref>\n\nThough the rate of early recovery is very high,<ref name=\"gordon\"/> with time a young person who stutters may transition from easy, relaxed repetition to more tense and effortful stuttering, including blocks and prolongations.<ref name=\"Ward13\"/> Some propose that parental reactions may affect the development of a chronic stutter. Recommendations to \"slow down\", \"take a breath\", \"say it again\", etc., may increase the child's anxiety and fear, leading to more difficulties with speaking and, in the \"cycle of stuttering,\" to yet more fear, anxiety and expectation of stuttering.<ref>{{harvnb|Ward|2006|pp= 13, 115}}</ref> With time secondary stuttering, including escape behaviours such as eye blinking and lip movements, may be used, as well as fear and avoidance of sounds, words, people, or speaking situations. Eventually, many become fully aware of their disorder and begin to identify themselves as stutterers. With this may come deeper frustration, embarrassment and shame.<ref>{{harvnb|Ward|2006|pp= 115\u2013116}}</ref> Other, rarer patterns of stuttering development have been described, including sudden onset with the child being unable to speak, despite attempts to do so.<ref name=\"Ward 2006 pp= 117\u2013119\">{{harvnb|Ward|2006|pp= 117\u2013119}}</ref> The child usually is unable to utter the first sound of a sentence, and shows high levels of awareness and frustration. Another variety also begins suddenly with frequent word and phrase repetition, and does not include the development of secondary stuttering behaviours.<ref name=\"Ward 2006 pp= 117\u2013119\"/>\n\n=====Neurogenic stuttering=====\nStuttering is also believed to be caused by neurophysiology. Neurogenic stuttering is a type of fluency disorder in which a person has difficulty in producing speech in a normal, smooth fashion. Individuals with fluency disorders may have speech that sounds fragmented or halting, with frequent interruptions and difficulty producing words without effort or struggle. Neurogenic stuttering typically appears following some sort of injury or disease to the central nervous system. Injuries to the brain and spinal cord, including cortex, subcortex, cerebellar, and even the neural pathway regions.<ref name=\"Carlson, N. 2013 pp. 497-500\"/>\n\n====Acquired stuttering====\nIn rare cases, stuttering may be acquired in adulthood as the result of a neurological event such as a head injury, tumour, stroke, or drug use. The stuttering has different characteristics from its developmental equivalent: it tends to be limited to part-word or sound repetitions, and is associated with a relative lack of anxiety and secondary stuttering behaviors. Techniques such as altered auditory feedback (see below), which may promote decreasing disfluency in people who stutter with the developmental condition, are not effective with the acquired type.<ref name=\"gordon\"/><ref name=\"craig2005\"/><ref>{{harvnb|Ward|2006|pp= 4, 332\u2013335}}</ref>\n\nPsychogenic stuttering may also arise after a traumatic experience such as a grief, the breakup of a relationship or as the psychological reaction to physical trauma. Its symptoms tend to be homogeneous: the stuttering is of sudden onset and associated with a significant event, it is constant and uninfluenced by different speaking situations, and there is little awareness or concern shown by the speaker.<ref>{{harvnb|Ward|2006|pp= 4, 332, 335\u2013337}}</ref>\n\n==Treatment==\n{{main|Stuttering therapy}}\nBefore beginning treatment, an assessment is needed, as diagnosing stuttering requires the skills of a certified speech-language pathologist (SLP).<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.asha.org/public/speech/disorders/stuttering/ |title=Stuttering |publisher=Asha.org |access-date=2014-05-12 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://archive.today/20131120151347/http://www.asha.org/public/speech/disorders/stuttering/ |archive-date=2013-11-20 |df= }}</ref>\nWhile there is no complete cure for stuttering, several treatment options exist that help individuals to better control their speech. Many of the available treatments focus on learning strategies to minimize stuttering through speed reduction, breathing regulation, and gradual progression from single-syllable responses to longer words, and eventually more complex sentences. Furthermore, some stuttering therapies help to address the anxiety that is often caused by stuttering, and consequently worsens stuttering symptoms.<ref name=\"nidcd.nih.gov\">{{cite web |url=http://www.nidcd.nih.gov/health/voice/pages/stutter.aspx#treated |title=Stuttering |publisher=Nidcd.nih.gov |access-date=2014-05-12 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140404214740/https://www.nidcd.nih.gov/health/voice/Pages/stutter.aspx#treated |archive-date=2014-04-04 |df= }}</ref> This method of treatment is referred to as a comprehensive approach, in which the main emphasis of treatment is directed toward improving the speaker's attitudes toward communication and minimizing the negative impact stuttering can have on the speaker's life.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.asha.org/uploadedFiles/public/TESStuttering.pdf |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100616043053/http://asha.org/uploadedFiles/public/TESStuttering.pdf |url-status=dead |archive-date=2010-06-16 |title=Stuttering |accessdate=2014-05-12 }}</ref> Treatment from a qualified S-LP can benefit people who stutter of any age.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.asha.org/uploadedFiles/public/TESStuttering.pdf|title=ASHA \u2013 Treatment Efficacy for Stuttering|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100616043053/http://www.asha.org/uploadedFiles/public/TESStuttering.pdf|archive-date=2010-06-16|url-status=dead|access-date=}}</ref>\n\nSpeech language pathologists teach people who stutter to control and monitor the rate at which they speak. In addition, people may learn to start saying words in a slightly slower and less physically tense manner. They may also learn to control or monitor their breathing. When learning to control speech rate, people often begin by practising smooth, fluent speech at rates that are much slower than typical speech, using short phrases and sentences. Over time, people learn to produce smooth speech at faster rates, in longer sentences, and in more challenging situations until speech sounds both fluent and natural. When treating stuttering in children, some researchers recommend that an evaluation be conducted every three months in order to determine whether or not the selected treatment option is working effectively. \"Follow-up\" or \"maintenance\" sessions are often necessary after completion of formal intervention to prevent relapse.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.asha.org/public/speech/disorders/stuttering.htm |title=Stuttering |publisher=Asha.org |access-date=2014-05-12 |url-status=live |archive-url=http://arquivo.pt/wayback/20091016041011/http://www.asha.org/public/speech/disorders/stuttering.htm |archive-date=2009-10-16 |df= }}</ref>\n\n===Fluency shaping therapy===\nFluency shaping therapy, also known as \"speak more fluently\", \"prolonged speech\", or \"connected speech\", trains people who stutter to speak less disfluently by controlling their breathing, phonation, and articulation (lips, jaw, and tongue). It is based on [[operant conditioning]] techniques.<ref>{{harvnb|Ward|2006|p= 257}}</ref>\n\nPeople who stutter are trained to reduce their speaking rate by stretching vowels and consonants, and using other disfluency-reducing techniques such as continuous airflow and soft speech contacts. The result is very slow, monotonic, but fluent speech, used only in the speech clinic. After the person who stutters masters these skills, the speaking rate and intonation are increased gradually. This more normal-sounding, fluent speech is then transferred to daily life outside the speech clinic, though lack of speech naturalness at the end of treatment remains a frequent criticism. Fluency shaping approaches are often taught in intensive group therapy programs, which may take two to three weeks to complete, but more recently the Camperdown program, using a much shorter schedule, has been shown to be effective.<ref>{{harvnb|Ward|2006|pp= 257\u201367}}</ref>\n\n===Modification therapy===\nThe goal of stuttering modification therapy is not to eliminate stuttering but to modify it so that stuttering is easier and less effortful.<ref>{{harvnb|Ward|2006|p= 253}}</ref> The rationale is that since fear and anxiety causes increased stuttering, using easier stuttering and with less fear and avoidance, stuttering will decrease. The most widely known approach was published by [[Charles Van Riper]] in 1973 and is also known as block modification therapy.<ref>{{harvnb|Ward|2006|p= 245}}</ref>  However, depending on the patient, speech therapy may be ineffective.<ref>[http://www.stuttering-stammering.com/ Stuttering, Stammering] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120910233428/http://www.stuttering-stammering.com/ |date=2012-09-10 }}</ref>\n\n===Electronic fluency device===\n{{main|Electronic fluency device}}\nAltered auditory feedback, so that people who stutter hear their voice differently, has been used for over 50 years in the treatment of stuttering.<ref name=\"bothe2007\">{{cite journal |author1=Bothe, A.&nbsp;K. |author2= Finn,&nbsp;P.|author3=Bramlett, R.&nbsp;E. |title=Pseudoscience and the SpeechEasy: Reply to Kalinowski, Saltuklaroglu, Stuart, and Guntupalli (2007)|journal= American Journal of Speech-Language Pathology |volume=16 |pages=77\u201383 |year=2007 |pmid=<!--none-->| doi = 10.1044/1058-0360(2007/010) |ref=harv}} <!-- is the \"author reply\" in PMID 17329677 --></ref> Altered auditory feedback effect can be produced by speaking in chorus with another person, by blocking out the person who stutters' voice while talking (masking), by delaying slightly the voice of the person who stutters (delayed auditory feedback) or by altering the frequency of the feedback (frequency altered feedback).

These medications are FDA approved in the United States and hold similar approval in most countries for other conditions and their safety profiles are well established in these disorders.\n\nThe best studied medication in stuttering is olanzapine whose effectiveness has been established in replicated trials. Olanzapine acts as a dopamine antagonist to D2 receptors in the mesolimbic pathway, and works similarly on serotonin 5HT2A receptors in the frontal cortex.<ref>Thomas, K., & Saadabadi, A. (2018).

Later studies found that this claim was not supported by the facts, so the influence of cultural factors in stuttering research declined. It is generally accepted by contemporary scholars that stuttering is present in every culture and in every race, although the attitude towards the actual prevalence differs.

Considering that language and culture are relatively fluid factors in one's understanding and production of language, it makes sense that bilingualism can be an important feature that impacts speech fluency. There are several ways during which stuttering may be noticed in bilingual children including the following.\n* The child is mixing vocabulary (code mixing) from both languages in one sentence. This is a normal process that helps the child increase his skills in the weaker language, but may trigger a temporary increase in disfluency.<ref name=\"Stuttering and the Bilingual Child\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.stutteringhelp.org/stuttering-and-bilingual-child|title=Stuttering and the Bilingual Child|website=Stuttering Foundation: A Nonprofit Organization Helping Those Who Stutter|access-date=2017-12-18|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170926020934/http://www.stutteringhelp.org/stuttering-and-bilingual-child|archive-date=2017-09-26|df=}}</ref>\n* The child is having difficulty finding the correct word to express his/her ideas resulting in an increase in normal speech disfluency.<ref name=\"Stuttering and the Bilingual Child\"/>\n* The child is having difficulty using grammatically complex sentences in one or both languages as compared to other children of the same age.  Also, the child may make grammatical mistakes.  Developing proficiency in both languages may be gradual, so development may be uneven between the two languages.<ref name=\"Stuttering and the Bilingual Child\"/>\n* Adding a second or third language between the ages of three and five years of age may cause stuttering to increase (become more severe).  However, this may be the case only when: (1) the child's first language is not strong and/or the child is experiencing difficulties in her first language, (2) One language is used more than the other or, (3) the child resists speaking the additional language.\nIt should also be noted that stuttering may present differently depending on the languages the individual uses.

This may include fears of having to [[elocution|enunciate]] specific vowels or consonants, fears of being caught stuttering in social situations, self-imposed isolation, anxiety, stress, shame, low self-esteem, being a possible target of bullying (especially in children), having to use word substitution and rearrange words in a sentence to hide stuttering, or a feeling of \"loss of control\" during speech. Stuttering is sometimes popularly seen as a symptom of anxiety, but there is actually no direct correlation in that direction (though as mentioned the inverse can be true, as social anxiety may actually develop in individuals as a result of their stuttering).<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.stammering.org/speaking-out/articles/what-relationship-between-stuttering-and-anxiety|title=What is the relationship between stuttering and anxiety? {{!}} British Stammering Association|website=www.stammering.org|access-date=2019-03-20|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170423073752/http://stammering.org/speaking-out/articles/what-relationship-between-stuttering-and-anxiety|archive-date=2017-04-23|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\nStuttering is generally not a problem with the physical production of speech sounds or putting thoughts into words. Acute nervousness and stress are not thought to cause stuttering, but they can trigger stuttering in people who have the speech disorder, and living with a stigmatized disability can result in [[anxiety (mood)|anxiety]] and high [[Allostatic load|allostatic stress load]] (chronic nervousness and stress) that reduce the amount of acute stress necessary to trigger stuttering in any given person who stutters, worsening the problem in the manner of a [[positive feedback]] system; the name 'stuttered speech syndrome' has been proposed for this condition.<ref>http://www.stutteredspeechsyndrome.com {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110208102736/http://stutteredspeechsyndrome.com/ |date=2011-02-08 }}</ref><ref>{{cite book|last=Irwin|first=M.|editor1-first=J.|editor1-last=Au-Yeung|editor2-first=M.

In stuttering, it is seen that many individuals do not demonstrate disfluencies when it comes to tasks that allow for automatic processing without substantial planning. For example, singing \"Happy Birthday\" or other relatively common, repeated linguistic discourses, could be fluid in people who stutter.  Tasks like this reduce semantic, syntactic, and prosodic planning, whereas spontaneous, \"controlled\" speech or reading aloud requires thoughts to transform into linguistic material and thereafter [[syntax]] and [[prosody (linguistics)|prosody]].  Some researchers hypothesize that controlled-language activated circuitry consistently does not function properly in people who stutter, whereas people who do not stutter only sometimes display disfluent speech and abnormal circuitry.<ref name=\"Department of Psychology, and Center for the Neural Basis of Cognition, University of Pittsburgh, PA 15260, USA.\">{{cite journal|doi=10.1016/s0140-6736(00)02547-2 |pmid=10981883|last=Sandak|first=R|title=Stuttering: a view from neuroimaging|volume=356|issue=9228|journal=The Lancet|pages=445\u2013446|year=2000}}</ref>\n\n==Causes==\nNo single, exclusive cause of developmental stuttering is known.

Young children like repetition and the more tense they are feeling, the more they like this outlet for their tension \u2013 an understandable and quite normal reaction. They are capable of repeating all types of behaviour. The more tension that is felt, the less one likes change. The more change, the greater can be the repetition. So, when a 3 year old finds he has a new baby brother or sister he may start repeating sounds. The repetitions can become conditioned and automatic and ensuing struggles against the repetitions result in prolongations and blocks in his speech. More boys stammer than girls, in the ratio of 3\u20134 boys : 1 girl. This is because the male [[Hypothalamic\u2013pituitary\u2013adrenal axis|Hypothalamic-Pituitary-Adrenal (HPA) Axis]] is more active. Whilst they are pumping out more [[cortisol]] than females under the same provocation, they can be tense or anxious and become repetitive.<ref>Stammering (Stuttering) A Complex Vocal Tic, Patricia Sims, Kindle version 2014</ref>\n\nIn a 2010 article, three genes were found by [[Dennis Drayna]] and team to correlate with stuttering: [[GNPTAB]], [[GNPTG]], and [[NAGPA]].

Research is complicated somewhat by the possibility that such differences could be the consequences of stuttering rather than a cause, but recent research on older children confirms structural differences thereby giving strength to the argument that at least some of the differences are not a consequence of stuttering.<ref name=\"watkins\">{{cite journal |vauthors=Watkins KE, Smith SM, Davis S, Howell P |title=Structural and functional abnormalities of the motor system in developmental stuttering |journal=Brain |volume=131 |issue=Pt 1 |pages=50\u20139 |date=January 2008  |pmid=17928317 |pmc=2492392 |doi=10.1093/brain/awm241}}</ref><ref name=\"chang\">{{cite journal |author= Soo-Eun, Chang|title= Brain anatomy differences in childhood stuttering |journal=[[NeuroImage (journal)|NeuroImage]] |year=2007 |ref= harv }}</ref>\n\nAuditory processing deficits have also been proposed as a cause of stuttering. Stuttering is less prevalent in deaf and hard-of-hearing individuals,<ref>{{harvnb|Ward|2006|pp= 46\u20137}}</ref> and stuttering may be reduced when auditory feedback is altered, such as by [[Auditory masking|masking]], [[delayed auditory feedback]] (DAF), or frequency altered feedback.<ref name=\"gordon\"/><ref>{{harvnb|Ward|2006|p= 58}}</ref> There is some evidence that the functional organization of the auditory cortex may be different in people who stutter.<ref name=\"gordon\"/>\n\nThere is evidence of differences in linguistic processing between people who stutter and people who do not stutter.<ref>{{harvnb|Ward|2006|p= 43}}</ref> Brain scans of adult people who stutter have found increased activation of the right hemisphere, which is associated with emotions, than in the left hemisphere, which is associated with speech.

In this approach, speech performance varies depending on the ''capacity'' that the individual has for producing fluent speech, and the ''demands'' placed upon the person by the speaking situation. Capacity for fluent speech may be affected by a predisposition to the disorder, auditory processing or motor speech deficits, and [[Cognition|cognitive]] or [[Affect (psychology)|affective]] issues. Demands may be increased by internal factors such as lack of confidence or [[Self-esteem|self esteem]] or inadequate language skills or external factors such as [[peer pressure]], time pressure, stressful speaking situations, insistence on perfect speech, and the like. In stuttering, the severity of the disorder is seen as likely to increase when demands placed on the person's speech and language system exceed their capacity to deal with these pressures.<ref>{{harvnb|Ward|2006|pp= 16\u201321}}</ref> However, the precise nature of the capacity or incapacity has not been delineated.\n\n==Mechanism==\n\n===Physiology===\nThough neuroimaging studies have not yet found specific neural correlates, there is much evidence that the brains of adults who stutter differ from the brains of adults who do not stutter. Several neuroimaging studies have emerged to identify areas associated with stuttering.  In general, during stuttering, cerebral activities change dramatically in comparison to silent rest or fluent speech between people who stutter and people who do not stutter. There is evidence that people who stutter activate motor programs before the articulatory or linguistic processing is initiated. Brain imaging studies have primarily been focused on adults. However, the neurological abnormalities found in adults does not determine whether childhood stuttering caused these abnormalities or whether the abnormalities cause stuttering.<ref name=watkins />\n\nStudies utilizing [[positron emission tomography]] (PET) have found during tasks that invoke disfluent speech, people who stutter show [[hypoactivity]] in cortical areas associated with language processing, such as [[Broca's area]], but hyperactivity in areas associated with motor function.<ref name=\"Department of Psychology, and Center for the Neural Basis of Cognition, University of Pittsburgh, PA 15260, USA.\" />  One such study that evaluated the stutter period found that there was over activation in the cerebrum and cerebellum, and relative deactivation of the left hemisphere auditory areas and frontal temporal regions.<ref name=\":4\">{{Cite book|title=A handbook on stuttering|last=Bloodstein|first=Oliver|last2=Ratner|first2=Nan Bernstein|publisher=Cengage Learning|year=2007|isbn=978-1418042035|location=|pages=142}}</ref>\n\n[[Functional magnetic resonance imaging]] (fMRI) has found abnormal activation in the right frontal operculum (RFO), which is an area associated with time-estimation tasks, occasionally incorporated in complex speech.<ref name=\"Department of Psychology, and Center for the Neural Basis of Cognition, University of Pittsburgh, PA 15260, USA.\" />\n\nResearchers have explored temporal cortical activations by utilizing [[magnetoencephalography]] (MEG).

The corpus callosum, rostrum, and the anterior mid-body sections are larger in adults who stutter as compared to normally fluent adults.

As a result, diagnosing stuttering requires the skills of a certified speech-language pathologist (SLP). Diagnosis of stuttering employs information both from direct observation of the individual and information about the individual's background, through a case history.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.stutteringhelp.org/neurogenic-stuttering|title=Neurogenic Stuttering|website=Stuttering Foundation: A Nonprofit Organization Helping Those Who Stutter|language=en|access-date=2020-01-29}}</ref>Information from both sources should consider things such as age, the various times it has occurred, and other impediments.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.nidcd.nih.gov/health/stuttering|title=Stuttering|date=2015-08-18|website=NIDCD|language=en|access-date=2020-01-29|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180520055057/https://www.nidcd.nih.gov/health/stuttering|archive-date=2018-05-20|url-status=dead}}</ref> The SLP may collect a case history on the individual through a detailed interview or conversation with the parents (if client is a child).

In particular, the therapist might test for factors including the types of disfluencies present (using a test such as the Disfluency Type Index (DTI)), their frequency and duration (number of iterations, percentage of syllables stuttered (%SS)), and speaking rate (syllables per minute (SPM), words per minute (WPM)). They may also test for naturalness and fluency in speaking (naturalness rating scale (NAT), test of childhood stuttering (TOCS)) and physical concomitants during speech (''Riley\u2019s Stuttering Severity Instrument Fourth Edition (SSI-4)'').<ref name=\"cirrie.buffalo.edu\"/> They might also employ a test to evaluate the severity of the stuttering and predictions for its course.

Children and adults are monitored and evaluated for evidence of possible social, psychological or emotional signs of stress related to their disorder. Some common assessments of this type measure factors including: anxiety (Endler multidimensional anxiety scales (EMAS)), attitudes (personal report of communication apprehension (PRCA)), perceptions of self (stutterers\u2019 self-rating of reactions to speech situations (SSRSS)), quality of life (overall assessment of the speaker's experience of stuttering (OASES)), behaviors (older adult self-report (OASR)), and mental health (composite international diagnostic interview (CIDI)).<ref>[http://www.latrobe.edu.au/health/downloads/star-stutteringresource.pdfLa Trobe University School of Human Communication Disorders]</ref>\n\nThe SLP will then attempt to combine the information garnered from the client's case study along with the information acquired from the assessments in order to make a final decision regarding the existence of a fluency disorder and determine the best course of treatment for the client.\n\nStuttering can also diagnosed per the DSM-5 diagnostic codes<ref>American Psychiatric Association. (2013). Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders (5th ed.). Washington, DC: Author.</ref> by clinical psychologists with adequate expertise.  The most recent version of the DSM-5 describes this speech disorder as \"Childhood-Onset Fluency Disorder (Stuttering)\" for developmental stuttering, and \"Adult-onset Fluency Disorder\".  However, the specific rationale for this change from the DSM-IV is ill-documented in the APA's published literature, and is felt by some to promote confusion between the very different terms \"fluency\" and \"disfluency\".\n\n===Normal disfluency===\n{{Main|Developmental dysfluency}}\nNormal disfluency should be ruled out before diagnosing stuttering.<ref>Ambrose, Nicoline Grinager, and Ehud Yairi. \"Normative Disfluency Data for Early Childhood Stuttering.\" ''Journal of Speech, Language, and Hearing Research'' 42, no. 4 (1999): 895-909. https://doi.org/10.1044/jslhr.4204.895 (\"Stuttering is shown to be qualitatively as well as quantitatively different from normal disfluency even at the earliest stages of stuttering.\")</ref> Many toddlers and preschool age children stutter as they are learning to talk, and although many parents worry about it, most of these children will outgrow the stuttering and will have normal speech as they get older. Since most of these children do not stutter after the preschool years, this normal stage of speech development is usually referred to as ''normal disfluency'' or ''developmental dysfluency''. As children learn to talk, they may repeat certain sounds, stumble on or mispronounce words, hesitate between words, substitute sounds for each other, and be unable to express some sounds. Young children learning to talk exhibit brief repetitions of certain sounds, syllables or short words, however, this normal dysfluency gradually dissipates as the child matures.\n\n===Classification===\nDevelopmental stuttering is stuttering that originates when a child is learning to speak and develops as the child matures into adulthood.\n\nOther disorders with symptoms resembling stuttering include [[autism]], [[cluttering]], [[Parkinson's disease]], [[essential tremor]], [[palilalia]], [[spasmodic dysphonia]], [[selective mutism]], and [[social anxiety]].\n\n====Developmental====\nStuttering is typically a [[developmental disorder]] beginning in early childhood and continuing into adulthood in at least 20% of affected children.<ref name=\"gordon\">{{cite journal |author=Gordon, N. |title=Stuttering: incidence and causes |journal=Developmental Medicine & Child Neurology |volume=44 |issue=4 |pages=278\u201381 |year=2002 |pmid=11995897 |doi = 10.1017/S0012162201002067 |ref=harv}}</ref><ref name=\"craig2005\">{{cite journal|author1= Craig, A.|author2= Tran, Y.|title=The epidemiology of stuttering: The need for reliable estimates of prevalence and anxiety levels over the lifespan|journal= Advances in Speech\u2013Language Pathology |volume=7 |issue=1 |pages=41\u201346 |year=2005 |ref= harv |doi= 10.1080/14417040500055060}}</ref> The mean onset of stuttering is 30 months.<ref name=\"fn 30\"/> Although there is variability, early stuttering behaviours usually consist of word or syllable repetitions, while secondary behaviours such as tension, avoidance or escape behaviours are absent.<ref name=\"Ward13\">{{harvnb|Ward|2006|p=13}}</ref> Most young children are unaware of the interruptions in their speech.<ref name=\"Ward13\"/> With young stutterers, disfluency may be episodic, and periods of stuttering are followed by periods of relatively decreased disfluency.<ref>{{harvnb|Ward|2006|pp=114\u20135}}</ref>\n\nThough the rate of early recovery is very high,<ref name=\"gordon\"/> with time a young person who stutters may transition from easy, relaxed repetition to more tense and effortful stuttering, including blocks and prolongations.<ref name=\"Ward13\"/> Some propose that parental reactions may affect the development of a chronic stutter. Recommendations to \"slow down\", \"take a breath\", \"say it again\", etc., may increase the child's anxiety and fear, leading to more difficulties with speaking and, in the \"cycle of stuttering,\" to yet more fear, anxiety and expectation of stuttering.<ref>{{harvnb|Ward|2006|pp= 13, 115}}</ref> With time secondary stuttering, including escape behaviours such as eye blinking and lip movements, may be used, as well as fear and avoidance of sounds, words, people, or speaking situations. Eventually, many become fully aware of their disorder and begin to identify themselves as stutterers. With this may come deeper frustration, embarrassment and shame.<ref>{{harvnb|Ward|2006|pp= 115\u2013116}}</ref> Other, rarer patterns of stuttering development have been described, including sudden onset with the child being unable to speak, despite attempts to do so.<ref name=\"Ward 2006 pp= 117\u2013119\">{{harvnb|Ward|2006|pp= 117\u2013119}}</ref> The child usually is unable to utter the first sound of a sentence, and shows high levels of awareness and frustration. Another variety also begins suddenly with frequent word and phrase repetition, and does not include the development of secondary stuttering behaviours.<ref name=\"Ward 2006 pp= 117\u2013119\"/>\n\n=====Neurogenic stuttering=====\nStuttering is also believed to be caused by neurophysiology. Neurogenic stuttering is a type of fluency disorder in which a person has difficulty in producing speech in a normal, smooth fashion. Individuals with fluency disorders may have speech that sounds fragmented or halting, with frequent interruptions and difficulty producing words without effort or struggle. Neurogenic stuttering typically appears following some sort of injury or disease to the central nervous system. Injuries to the brain and spinal cord, including cortex, subcortex, cerebellar, and even the neural pathway regions.<ref name=\"Carlson, N. 2013 pp. 497-500\"/>\n\n====Acquired stuttering====\nIn rare cases, stuttering may be acquired in adulthood as the result of a neurological event such as a head injury, tumour, stroke, or drug use. The stuttering has different characteristics from its developmental equivalent: it tends to be limited to part-word or sound repetitions, and is associated with a relative lack of anxiety and secondary stuttering behaviors. Techniques such as altered auditory feedback (see below), which may promote decreasing disfluency in people who stutter with the developmental condition, are not effective with the acquired type.<ref name=\"gordon\"/><ref name=\"craig2005\"/><ref>{{harvnb|Ward|2006|pp= 4, 332\u2013335}}</ref>\n\nPsychogenic stuttering may also arise after a traumatic experience such as a grief, the breakup of a relationship or as the psychological reaction to physical trauma. Its symptoms tend to be homogeneous: the stuttering is of sudden onset and associated with a significant event, it is constant and uninfluenced by different speaking situations, and there is little awareness or concern shown by the speaker.<ref>{{harvnb|Ward|2006|pp= 4, 332, 335\u2013337}}</ref>\n\n==Treatment==\n{{main|Stuttering therapy}}\nBefore beginning treatment, an assessment is needed, as diagnosing stuttering requires the skills of a certified speech-language pathologist (SLP).<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.asha.org/public/speech/disorders/stuttering/ |title=Stuttering |publisher=Asha.org |access-date=2014-05-12 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://archive.today/20131120151347/http://www.asha.org/public/speech/disorders/stuttering/ |archive-date=2013-11-20 |df= }}</ref>\nWhile there is no complete cure for stuttering, several treatment options exist that help individuals to better control their speech. Many of the available treatments focus on learning strategies to minimize stuttering through speed reduction, breathing regulation, and gradual progression from single-syllable responses to longer words, and eventually more complex sentences. Furthermore, some stuttering therapies help to address the anxiety that is often caused by stuttering, and consequently worsens stuttering symptoms.<ref name=\"nidcd.nih.gov\">{{cite web |url=http://www.nidcd.nih.gov/health/voice/pages/stutter.aspx#treated |title=Stuttering |publisher=Nidcd.nih.gov |access-date=2014-05-12 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140404214740/https://www.nidcd.nih.gov/health/voice/Pages/stutter.aspx#treated |archive-date=2014-04-04 |df= }}</ref> This method of treatment is referred to as a comprehensive approach, in which the main emphasis of treatment is directed toward improving the speaker's attitudes toward communication and minimizing the negative impact stuttering can have on the speaker's life.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.asha.org/uploadedFiles/public/TESStuttering.pdf |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100616043053/http://asha.org/uploadedFiles/public/TESStuttering.pdf |url-status=dead |archive-date=2010-06-16 |title=Stuttering |accessdate=2014-05-12 }}</ref> Treatment from a qualified S-LP can benefit people who stutter of any age.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.asha.org/uploadedFiles/public/TESStuttering.pdf|title=ASHA \u2013 Treatment Efficacy for Stuttering|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100616043053/http://www.asha.org/uploadedFiles/public/TESStuttering.pdf|archive-date=2010-06-16|url-status=dead|access-date=}}</ref>\n\nSpeech language pathologists teach people who stutter to control and monitor the rate at which they speak. In addition, people may learn to start saying words in a slightly slower and less physically tense manner. They may also learn to control or monitor their breathing. When learning to control speech rate, people often begin by practising smooth, fluent speech at rates that are much slower than typical speech, using short phrases and sentences. Over time, people learn to produce smooth speech at faster rates, in longer sentences, and in more challenging situations until speech sounds both fluent and natural. When treating stuttering in children, some researchers recommend that an evaluation be conducted every three months in order to determine whether or not the selected treatment option is working effectively. \"Follow-up\" or \"maintenance\" sessions are often necessary after completion of formal intervention to prevent relapse.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.asha.org/public/speech/disorders/stuttering.htm |title=Stuttering |publisher=Asha.org |access-date=2014-05-12 |url-status=live |archive-url=http://arquivo.pt/wayback/20091016041011/http://www.asha.org/public/speech/disorders/stuttering.htm |archive-date=2009-10-16 |df= }}</ref>\n\n===Fluency shaping therapy===\nFluency shaping therapy, also known as \"speak more fluently\", \"prolonged speech\", or \"connected speech\", trains people who stutter to speak less disfluently by controlling their breathing, phonation, and articulation (lips, jaw, and tongue). It is based on [[operant conditioning]] techniques.<ref>{{harvnb|Ward|2006|p= 257}}</ref>\n\nPeople who stutter are trained to reduce their speaking rate by stretching vowels and consonants, and using other disfluency-reducing techniques such as continuous airflow and soft speech contacts. The result is very slow, monotonic, but fluent speech, used only in the speech clinic. After the person who stutters masters these skills, the speaking rate and intonation are increased gradually. This more normal-sounding, fluent speech is then transferred to daily life outside the speech clinic, though lack of speech naturalness at the end of treatment remains a frequent criticism. Fluency shaping approaches are often taught in intensive group therapy programs, which may take two to three weeks to complete, but more recently the Camperdown program, using a much shorter schedule, has been shown to be effective.<ref>{{harvnb|Ward|2006|pp= 257\u201367}}</ref>\n\n===Modification therapy===\nThe goal of stuttering modification therapy is not to eliminate stuttering but to modify it so that stuttering is easier and less effortful.<ref>{{harvnb|Ward|2006|p= 253}}</ref> The rationale is that since fear and anxiety causes increased stuttering, using easier stuttering and with less fear and avoidance, stuttering will decrease.

Although different classes of medications have been investigated, those with dopamine blocking activity have been shown in numerous trials to have positive effects on stuttering. These medications are FDA approved in the United States and hold similar approval in most countries for other conditions and their safety profiles are well established in these disorders.\n\nThe best studied medication in stuttering is olanzapine whose effectiveness has been established in replicated trials. Olanzapine acts as a dopamine antagonist to D2 receptors in the mesolimbic pathway, and works similarly on serotonin 5HT2A receptors in the frontal cortex.<ref>Thomas, K., & Saadabadi, A. (2018). Olanzapine. In ''StatPearls [Internet]''. StatPearls Publishing.</ref> At doses between 2.5\u20135&nbsp;mg, olanzapine has been shown to be more effective than placebo at reducing stuttering symptoms, and may serve as a first-line pharmacological treatment for stuttering based on the preponderance of its efficacy data.<ref name=\":0\">Shaygannejad, V., Khatoonabadi, S.

However, haloperidol in particular often result in poor long-term compliance due to concerning side effects such as movement disorders and prolactin elevation, which can also occur with risperidone.<ref name=\":0\" /><ref>Maguire, Gerald A., Glyndon D.

All these medications as well as olanzapine can carry the potential risk of a long-term movement disorder known as tardive dyskinesia.\n\nThe investigational compound, ecopipam is unique from other dopamine antagonists in that it acts on D1 receptors instead of D2, owing little, if any risk, of movement disorders. An open label study of ecopipam in adults demonstrated significantly improved stuttering symptoms with no reports of parkinsonian-like movement disorders or tardive dyskinesia which can be seen with D2 antagonists.<ref name=\":2\">Maguire, G.A., Lasalle L., Hoffmeyer D., Nelson M., Lochead J.D., Davis K., Burris A., Yaruss J.S., \u201cEcopipam as a pharmacologic treatment of stuttering.\u201d ''Ann Clin Psychiatry'' (2019 Aug), 31(3), 164-168.</ref> In addition, ecopipam had no reported weight gain, but instead has been reported to lead to weight loss.<ref name=\":2\" /> In a preliminary study, it was well tolerated in subjects, effectively reduced stuttering severity, and was even associated in a short-term study with improved quality of life in persons who stutter.<ref name=\":2\" /> Further research is still warranted, but this novel mechanism is showing promise in the pharmacologic treatment of stuttering.\n\nOne should always consult with a medical doctor before considering medication treatment of stuttering to review potential risks and benefits.\n\n===Support===\nWith existing behavioral and prosthetic treatments providing limited relief and pharmacologic treatments in need of FDA approval for widespread use, support groups and the self-help movement continue to gain popularity and support from professionals and people who stutter. Self-help groups provide people who stutter a shared forum within which they can access resources and support from others facing the same challenges of stuttering.<ref name=\"nidcd.nih.gov\"/> One of the basic tenets behind the self-help movement is that since a cure does not exist, quality of life can be improved by not thinking about the stammer for prolonged periods.

Later studies found that this claim was not supported by the facts, so the influence of cultural factors in stuttering research declined. It is generally accepted by contemporary scholars that stuttering is present in every culture and in every race, although the attitude towards the actual prevalence differs.

The largest number of studies has been conducted in European countries and in North America, where the experts agree on the mean estimate to be about 1% of the general population (Bloodtein, 1995.

In this theory, stuttering was attributed to imbalances of the [[four bodily humors]]\u2014yellow bile, blood, black bile, and phlegm. [[Hieronymus Mercurialis]], writing in the sixteenth century, proposed methods to redress the imbalance including changes in diet, reduced libido (in men only), and [[vomiting|purging]]. Believing that fear aggravated stuttering, he suggested techniques to overcome this.

Others recommended shortening the [[uvula]] or removing the [[tonsil]]s. All were abandoned due to the high danger of bleeding to death and their failure to stop stuttering. Less drastically, [[Jean Marc Gaspard Itard]] placed a small forked golden plate under the tongue in order to support \"weak\" muscles.<ref name=\"brosch\"/>\n\n[[Image:Notker Balbulus 2.jpg|thumb|left|[[Notker of St. Gall|Notker Balbulus]], from a medieval manuscript.]]\nItalian [[pathologist]] [[Giovanni Battista Morgagni|Giovanni Morgagni]] attributed stuttering to deviations in the [[hyoid bone]], a conclusion he came to via [[autopsy]].<ref name=\"rieber\"/> Blessed [[Notker of St. Gall]] (c. 840\u2013912), called Balbulus (\"The Stutterer\") and described by his biographer as being \"delicate of body but not of mind, stuttering of tongue but not of intellect, pushing boldly forward in things Divine,\" was invoked against stammering.\n\nA famous Briton who stammered was King [[George VI]]. George VI went through years of speech therapy, most successfully under Australian speech therapist [[Lionel Logue]], for his stammer. This is dealt with in the Academy Award-winning film ''[[The King's Speech]]'' (2010) in which [[Colin Firth]] plays George VI. The film is based on an original screenplay by [[David Seidler]] who also used to stutter as a child until age 16.\n\nAnother notable case was that of British Prime Minister [[Winston Churchill]]. Churchill claimed, perhaps not directly discussing himself, that \"[s]ometimes a slight and not unpleasing stammer or impediment has been of some assistance in securing the attention of the audience...\"<ref name=\"fn 10\">{{cite web | title=Churchill: A Study in Oratory | publisher=The Churchill Centre | url=http://www.winstonchurchill.org/i4a/pages/index.cfm?pageid=814 | access-date=2005-04-05 | url-status=dead | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050419061110/http://www.winstonchurchill.org/i4a/pages/index.cfm?pageid=814 | archive-date=2005-04-19 | df= }}</ref> However, those who knew Churchill and [http://www.utstat.utoronto.ca/sharp/Churchill.htm commented] on his stutter believed that it was or had been a significant problem for him. His secretary [[Phyllis Moir]] commented that \"Winston Churchill was born and grew up with a stutter\" in her 1941 book ''I was Winston Churchill's Private Secretary''. She also noted about one incident, \"'It\u2019s s-s-simply s-s-splendid,' he stuttered\u2014as he always did when excited.\" Louis J. Alber, who helped to arrange a lecture tour of the United States, wrote in Volume 55 of ''The American Mercury'' (1942) that \"Churchill struggled to express his feelings but his stutter caught him in the throat and his face turned purple\" and that \"born with a stutter and a [[lisp]], both caused in large measure by a defect in his palate, Churchill was at first seriously hampered in his public speaking.

Considering that language and culture are relatively fluid factors in one's understanding and production of language, it makes sense that bilingualism can be an important feature that impacts speech fluency. There are several ways during which stuttering may be noticed in bilingual children including the following.\n* The child is mixing vocabulary (code mixing) from both languages in one sentence. This is a normal process that helps the child increase his skills in the weaker language, but may trigger a temporary increase in disfluency.<ref name=\"Stuttering and the Bilingual Child\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.stutteringhelp.org/stuttering-and-bilingual-child|title=Stuttering and the Bilingual Child|website=Stuttering Foundation: A Nonprofit Organization Helping Those Who Stutter|access-date=2017-12-18|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170926020934/http://www.stutteringhelp.org/stuttering-and-bilingual-child|archive-date=2017-09-26|df=}}</ref>\n* The child is having difficulty finding the correct word to express his/her ideas resulting in an increase in normal speech disfluency.<ref name=\"Stuttering and the Bilingual Child\"/>\n* The child is having difficulty using grammatically complex sentences in one or both languages as compared to other children of the same age.  Also, the child may make grammatical mistakes.  Developing proficiency in both languages may be gradual, so development may be uneven between the two languages.<ref name=\"Stuttering and the Bilingual Child\"/>\n* Adding a second or third language between the ages of three and five years of age may cause stuttering to increase (become more severe).  However, this may be the case only when: (1) the child's first language is not strong and/or the child is experiencing difficulties in her first language, (2) One language is used more than the other or, (3) the child resists speaking the additional language.\nIt should also be noted that stuttering may present differently depending on the languages the individual uses. For example, morphological and other linguistic differences between languages may make presentation of disfluency appear to be more or less of a problem depending on the individual case.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=aAbPBQAAQBAJ&pg=PA362&lpg=PA362&dq=bilingual+stuttering+wiki#v=onepage&q=bilingual%20stuttering%20wiki&f=false|title=Multilingual Aspects of Fluency Disorders|last=Howell|first=Peter|last2=Borsel|first2=John Van|date=2011|publisher=Multilingual Matters|isbn=9781847693587}}</ref>\n\n==== Research ====\nMuch research is being conducted to look at the prevalence of stuttering in bilingual populations and the differences between languages.

Italy won their third Olympic title at the [[Water polo at the 1992 Summer Olympics|1992 Summer Olympics]] in [[Barcelona]], [[Spain]], beating the hosts and tournament favourites [[Spain men's national water polo team|Spain]] 9\u20138 after extra time in a thrilling final. Only [[Hungary men's national water polo team|Hungary]] (9), and Great Britain (4) have more Olympic titles.\n\nThe Italian national side have also won four World Championships, in [[1978 FINA Men's World Water Polo Championship|1978]], [[1994 FINA Men's World Water Polo Championship|1994]], [[Water polo at the 2011 World Aquatics Championships \u2013 Men's tournament|2011]] and [[Water polo at the 2019 World Aquatics Championships \u2013 Men's tournament|2019]], and the World Cup once in [[1993 FINA Men's Water Polo World Cup|1993]].

Italy won their third Olympic title at the [[Water polo at the 1992 Summer Olympics|1992 Summer Olympics]] in [[Barcelona]], [[Spain]], beating the hosts and tournament favourites [[Spain men's national water polo team|Spain]] 9\u20138 after extra time in a thrilling final. Only [[Hungary men's national water polo team|Hungary]] (9), and Great Britain (4) have more Olympic titles.\n\nThe Italian national side have also won four World Championships, in [[1978 FINA Men's World Water Polo Championship|1978]], [[1994 FINA Men's World Water Polo Championship|1994]], [[Water polo at the 2011 World Aquatics Championships \u2013 Men's tournament|2011]] and [[Water polo at the 2019 World Aquatics Championships \u2013 Men's tournament|2019]], and the World Cup once in [[1993 FINA Men's Water Polo World Cup|1993]].
