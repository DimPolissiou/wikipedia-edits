On a coal-fired locomotive, the fireman's station remains on the footplate behind the [[Firebox (steam engine)|firebox]] so as to be next to the [[tender (rail)|tender]]. On an oil-fired locomotive, the fireman's station could be (and normally is) in the forward cab. This type of design was widely, though not commonly, used throughout Europe in the first half of the 20th century, often in conjunction with an enclosed body design and/or [[Streamliner|streamlining]].\n\nVisibility is greatly improved from the cab, and fumes from the chimney do not fill a forward cab in tunnels. However, the crew's prospects in the event of a collision are worse, and if the driver and fireman are in separate places it is difficult for them to communicate, just as in [[autotrain]]s.\n\n=== Germany: Deutsche Reichsbahn ===\nIn Germany, Borsig in Berlin built a one-off streamlined cab forward [[DRG Class 05]] (serial number 05 003) [[4-6-4]] in 1937, with further development stopped by World War II.

The design speed was {{convert|175|kph|mph|abbr=on}}, but its conventional layout sister 05 002 set a new [[Land speed record for railed vehicles|world speed record for steam locomotives]] on May 11, 1936, after reaching {{convert|200.4|kph|mph|abbr=on}} on the [[Berlin\u2013Hamburg Railway|Berlin\u2013Hamburg line]] hauling a 197 t train, a record it lost two years later to the British [[LNER Class A4]] [[Mallard (locomotive)|4468 Mallard]]. In 1944, the streamlining was removed, but the 05 003 had by then already lost its cab forward layout<ref>page 12, ''[[Trains (magazine)|Trains & Travel]]'' magazine, November 1952</ref>. After the war, it pulled express trains in West Germany until 1958.

These [[4-6-0]] engines had a three-axle tender, and were nicknamed \"mucca\" (cow).

The 39 long tunnels and nearly {{convert|40|mi|km}} of [[snow shed]]s of the [[Sierra Nevada (U.S.)|Sierra Nevada]] could funnel dangerous exhaust fumes back into the crew compartment of a conventional locomotive. After a number of crews nearly asphyxiated, the locomotive was run in reverse. This meant that the tender was leading the train, which introduced new problems. The tender blocked the view ahead and put crewmen on the wrong sides of the cab for seeing signals. The tenders were not designed to be pushed at the lead of the train, which limited speeds.

The oil and water tanks were pressurized so that both would flow normally even on uphill grades. Visibility from the cab was superb, such that one crewman could easily survey both sides of the track.

One problematic aspect of the design, however, was the routing of the oil lines; because the firebox was located ahead of the driving wheels (instead of behind them, the usual practice), oil leaks could cause the wheels to slip. A nuisance under most conditions, it resulted in at least one fatal accident. This occurred in 1941 when a cab-forward with leaking steam and oil lines entered [[Santa Susana Tunnel|the tunnel]] at [[Santa Susana Pass]], near Los Angeles. The tunnel was on a grade, and as the slow-moving train ascended the tunnel, oil on the rails caused the wheels to slip and spin.

One example of the type, [[Southern Pacific 4294]], is kept at the [[California State Railroad Museum]] in [[Sacramento, California]]. It is a [[4-8-8-2]] locomotive and is the only one to escape being scrapped. It was also SP's last new steam locomotive, built in 1944.\n\nThe [[North Pacific Coast Railroad]], later part of the SP-owned [[Northwestern Pacific]] company, rebuilt an 1875 [[4-4-0]] into a cab-forward locomotive. This innovative engine was built by William (Bill) Thomas, the NPC master mechanic who was nationally known {{why?|date=May 2013}} and holder of a number of patents. Thomas used the running gear and frame from NPC locomotive 5, the \"Bodega\", which had been wrecked in 1897, to build NPC 21. With the addition a new and unusual marine [[water tube boiler]] and an all-steel cab, installed in reverse order from standard engines, this unique creation earned Thomas a patent on the locomotive design. No. 21 entered service in 1900, but only lasted a few years due to design flaws in the boiler. The crews were not satisfied with the new engine, finding it difficult to operate, and with fears of the possible results of a collision. They dubbed it \"The Freak\".<ref>{{cite book|title=Sausalito |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=MF6dfMoWzhEC&pg=PA56 |year=2005 |publisher=Arcadia Publishing |isbn=978-0-7385-3036-9|page=56 |accessdate=2 March 2018}}</ref>\n\n=== Prussia ===\nExperimental Prussian T 16 (see [[:de:Preu\u00dfische T 16 (Versuch)|in German]]) [[UIC classification of locomotive axle arrangements|2'C2']] ([[4-6-4]]) [[tank locomotive]] had control cabs at both ends.\n\n=== UK: Southern Railway ===\n[[Oliver Bulleid]]'s ill-fated ''[[SR Leader class|Leader]]'' is sometimes referred to as a cab-forward locomotive, but since it had a cab at each end like a typical modern diesel or electric locomotive, this designation is not entirely appropriate.\n\n== Road transport ==\n\n=== Automobiles ===\n[[File:1975_AACA_AMC_Pacer_X_red-white_sideP.jpg|thumb|right|The [[AMC Pacer]]'s forward placement of the passenger compartment]] \n[[File:98-04 Dodge Intrepid.jpg|thumb|The [[Dodge Intrepid]] is one of the best known examples of cab forward design in automobiles]]\n\nThe cab forward design allows the passenger volume to be larger than in other similar sized automobiles.<ref>{{cite web|url= http://www.american-motors.de/en/pacer/history/amc_pacer.pdf |last=Mederle |first=Wolfgang A. |title=Chapter 1: History ''The American Motors Pacer'' |date=26 December 2005 |accessdate=14 November 2017}}</ref>\n\nThe first modern [[Mass production|mass-produced]] U.S. automobile using the cab forward concept was the [[AMC Pacer|Pacer]], introduced in 1975 by [[American Motors|American Motors Corporation]] (AMC).<ref>{{cite book|last=Cranswick |first=Marc |title=The Cars of American Motors: An Illustrated History |year=2011 |publisher=McFarland |isbn=9780786485703 |page=178 |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=r9j7MWLE_jMC&pg=PA178&lpg=PA178&dq=Cab+forward+AMC+Pacer |quote=First domestic car with cab forward design |accessdate=14 November 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url= http://www.azsolo2.com/pylon_press/pp2003/pp200311.htm |last=Driscoll |first=Mike |title=The pylon points to: Mindi Cross |publisher=The Pylon Press |date=November 2003 |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20120216001144/http://www.azsolo2.com/pylon_press/pp2003/pp200311.htm |archivedate=16 February 2012 |accessdate=14 November 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.amcpacer.com/features/did-the-pacer-kill-amc.asp |last=Stakes |first=Eddie |title=Response to the posting of Matt Crawford's \"Why a Pacer?\" essay, \"Did the Pacer kill AMC?\" |publisher=amcpacer.com |accessdate=14 November 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|last=Peter |first=Eric |title=Automotive Atrocities: The Cars We Love to Hate |publisher=MotorBooks/MBI Publishing |year=2004 |isbn=978-0-7603-1787-7 |page=54 }}</ref> The company did not call it \"cab forward\", but the Pacer's layout placed the passenger compartment farther forward than was typical to that time.<ref>{{cite web|url= http://ca.autos.yahoo.com/photos/15-styling-cues-for-the-ages-gallery-1373413090-slideshow/amc-pacer-photo-1373415212644.html |title=15 styling cues for the ages gallery |publisher=Yahoo Autos |date=9 July 2013 |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20140104205505/http://ca.autos.yahoo.com/photos/15-styling-cues-for-the-ages-gallery-1373413090-slideshow/amc-pacer-photo-1373415212644.html |archivedate=4 January 2014 |accessdate=14 November 2017}}</ref> Its [[Pillar (car)|A-pillars]] were moved forward and the windshield was placed over part of the engine compartment.

Better visibility and maneuverability in tight quarters, such as for city delivery, are benefits of locating the truck's cab up front.

One example of the type, [[Southern Pacific 4294]], is kept at the [[California State Railroad Museum]] in [[Sacramento, California]]. It is a [[4-8-8-2]] locomotive and is the only one to escape being scrapped. It was also SP's last new steam locomotive, built in 1944.\n\nThe [[North Pacific Coast Railroad]], later part of the SP-owned [[Northwestern Pacific]] company, rebuilt an 1875 [[4-4-0]] into a cab-forward locomotive. This innovative engine was built by William (Bill) Thomas, the NPC master mechanic who was nationally known {{why?|date=May 2013}} and holder of a number of patents. Thomas used the running gear and frame from NPC locomotive 5, the \"Bodega\", which had been wrecked in 1897, to build NPC 21. With the addition a new and unusual marine [[water tube boiler]] and an all-steel cab, installed in reverse order from standard engines, this unique creation earned Thomas a patent on the locomotive design. No. 21 entered service in 1900, but only lasted a few years due to design flaws in the boiler. The crews were not satisfied with the new engine, finding it difficult to operate, and with fears of the possible results of a collision. They dubbed it \"The Freak\".<ref>{{cite book|title=Sausalito |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=MF6dfMoWzhEC&pg=PA56 |year=2005 |publisher=Arcadia Publishing |isbn=978-0-7385-3036-9|page=56 |accessdate=2 March 2018}}</ref>\n\n=== Prussia ===\nExperimental Prussian T 16 (see [[:de:Preu\u00dfische T 16 (Versuch)|in German]]) [[UIC classification of locomotive axle arrangements|2'C2']] ([[4-6-4]]) [[tank locomotive]] had control cabs at both ends.\n\n=== UK: Southern Railway ===\n[[Oliver Bulleid]]'s ill-fated ''[[SR Leader class|Leader]]'' is sometimes referred to as a cab-forward locomotive, but since it had a cab at each end like a typical modern diesel or electric locomotive, this designation is not entirely appropriate.\n\n== Road transport ==\n\n=== Automobiles ===\n[[File:1975_AACA_AMC_Pacer_X_red-white_sideP.jpg|thumb|right|The [[AMC Pacer]]'s forward placement of the passenger compartment]] \n[[File:98-04 Dodge Intrepid.jpg|thumb|The [[Dodge Intrepid]] is one of the best known examples of cab forward design in automobiles]]\n\nThe cab forward design allows the passenger volume to be larger than in other similar sized automobiles.<ref>{{cite web|url= http://www.american-motors.de/en/pacer/history/amc_pacer.pdf |last=Mederle |first=Wolfgang A. |title=Chapter 1: History ''The American Motors Pacer'' |date=26 December 2005 |accessdate=14 November 2017}}</ref>\n\nThe first modern [[Mass production|mass-produced]] U.S. automobile using the cab forward concept was the [[AMC Pacer|Pacer]], introduced in 1975 by [[American Motors|American Motors Corporation]] (AMC).<ref>{{cite book|last=Cranswick |first=Marc |title=The Cars of American Motors: An Illustrated History |year=2011 |publisher=McFarland |isbn=9780786485703 |page=178 |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=r9j7MWLE_jMC&pg=PA178&lpg=PA178&dq=Cab+forward+AMC+Pacer |quote=First domestic car with cab forward design |accessdate=14 November 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url= http://www.azsolo2.com/pylon_press/pp2003/pp200311.htm |last=Driscoll |first=Mike |title=The pylon points to: Mindi Cross |publisher=The Pylon Press |date=November 2003 |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20120216001144/http://www.azsolo2.com/pylon_press/pp2003/pp200311.htm |archivedate=16 February 2012 |accessdate=14 November 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.amcpacer.com/features/did-the-pacer-kill-amc.asp |last=Stakes |first=Eddie |title=Response to the posting of Matt Crawford's \"Why a Pacer?\" essay, \"Did the Pacer kill AMC?\" |publisher=amcpacer.com |accessdate=14 November 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|last=Peter |first=Eric |title=Automotive Atrocities: The Cars We Love to Hate |publisher=MotorBooks/MBI Publishing |year=2004 |isbn=978-0-7603-1787-7 |page=54 }}</ref> The company did not call it \"cab forward\", but the Pacer's layout placed the passenger compartment farther forward than was typical to that time.<ref>{{cite web|url= http://ca.autos.yahoo.com/photos/15-styling-cues-for-the-ages-gallery-1373413090-slideshow/amc-pacer-photo-1373415212644.html |title=15 styling cues for the ages gallery |publisher=Yahoo Autos |date=9 July 2013 |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20140104205505/http://ca.autos.yahoo.com/photos/15-styling-cues-for-the-ages-gallery-1373413090-slideshow/amc-pacer-photo-1373415212644.html |archivedate=4 January 2014 |accessdate=14 November 2017}}</ref> Its [[Pillar (car)|A-pillars]] were moved forward and the windshield was placed over part of the engine compartment.

Better visibility and maneuverability in tight quarters, such as for city delivery, are benefits of locating the truck's cab up front. Large trucks of this type are most often described as ''cab over engine'' (COE) or [[cab over]] models.\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n== External links ==\n* [http://www.skyrocket.de/locomotive/cabforward.htm A site with photographs of cab-forward locomotives.]\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20080420195854/http://www.steamlocomotive.com/cabforward/ Steam Locomotive.com's Southern Pacific Cab Forward article, including detailed specifications.]\n\n{{SP cab forward locomotives}}\n\n{{Locostyles}}\n\n[[Category:Car body styles]]\n[[Category:Locomotive body styles]]\n[[Category:Automotive styling features]]\n\n[[cs:Trambus]]\n", "name_user": "Kokopelli-UK", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eForney design:minor amends to text, for clarity", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cab_forward"}

The album came two years after the band's founding, after they initially struggled as an alternative to [[grunge|grunge music]], which was prevalent in [[Los Angeles]] during the early 1990s. It was almost entirely arranged and composed by frontman [[Rivers Cuomo]], who also anticipated to lead the band in self-producing the album. However, at the behest of DGC, the band was required to include a producer, and collectively opted for [[The Cars|Cars]] frontman [[Ric Ocasek]]. Most of the recording was conducted at [[Electric Lady Studios]] in [[New York City]] between August and September 1993, a period that coincided with founding guitarist [[Jason Cropper]] being fired and replaced by [[Brian Bell]].\n\nUnder Ocasek's direction, the band opted for a brighter sound, while bassist [[Matt Sharp]] collaborated with Cuomo to ensure that the album contained an overriding sonic concept of treating the guitars and bass as isolated ten-string instruments, thus maximizing its potential when united.<ref name=\"Pitchforklist\">{{cite web | last = DiCrescenzo | first = Brent | url = http://www.pitchforkmedia.com/article/feature/36737-staff-list-top-100-albums-of-the-1990s/page_8 | title = Top 100 Albums of the 1990s | publisher = [[Pitchfork Media|Pitchfork]] | accessdate = 2007-09-04 | url-status = dead | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20071023195032/http://www.pitchforkmedia.com/article/feature/36737-staff-list-top-100-albums-of-the-1990s/page_8 | archivedate = October 23, 2007 | df = mdy-all }}</ref> Lyrically, ''Weezer'' focuses on outsiderdom and [[social awkwardness]], while also touching on melancholic themes of love, romance, and familial issues.<ref>https://www.udiscovermusic.com/stories/weezer-blue-album-power-pop/</ref> \n\n''Weezer'' was supported by the singles \"[[Undone \u2013 The Sweater Song]]\", \"[[Buddy Holly (song)|Buddy Holly]]\", and \"[[Say It Ain't So]]\", which, alongside their respective [[music video]]s, brought Weezer mainstream success. The album itself peaked at number sixteen on the [[Billboard 200|US ''Billboard'' 200]], and was certified [[RIAA certification|triple platinum]] by 1995.

After a lot of practice, I started to get it down.\"<ref>{{harvnb|Luerssen|2004|p=85}}</ref>\n\nWeezer rehearsed 15 songs in New York in preparation for the Electric Lady Studios recording sessions. Four songs from this rehearsal would not be attempted for the album: \"Lullaby for Wayne\", \"I Swear It's True\", \"Getting Up and Leaving\", and a reprise version of \"In the Garage\". The other song, an ode to two women who ran the Weezer fanclub called \"Mykel & Carli\", was attempted during the Electric Lady sessions, but was also abandoned (this recording was later released as a digital bonus track on the 2010 compilation ''[[Death to False Metal]]''). A later recording of \"Mykel & Carli\" was featured as a B-side on the \"[[Undone \u2013 The Sweater Song]]\" single.<ref>{{harvnb|Luerssen|2004|pp=88\u201391}}</ref>\n\nThe band considered self-producing, but were pressured by [[Geffen Records|Geffen]] to choose a producer.

In 1994, 70s rock had come to mean either a bastardized version of [[Led Zeppelin]] or a bullshit reconstruction of [[punk rock]]. As guitar nerds, Weezer sought influence there but found true inspiration in forgotten bubblegum power-pop like [[Cheap Trick]], [[Raspberries (band)|Raspberries]], [[20/20 (band)|20/20]], and [[The Quick (U.S. band)|The Quick]]. Most impressively, Rivers Cuomo rescued the thrilling guitar solo from finger-tapping metal and disregarding grunge/punk. A decade later air-guitaring to the album feels far less embarrassing than singing along. With the help of [[Spike Jonze]], Weezer kept joy alive in [[arena rock]], making the critical repositioning of Weezer as some emo touchstone even more absentminded.

The album came two years after the band's founding, after they initially struggled as an alternative to [[grunge|grunge music]], which was prevalent in [[Los Angeles]] during the early 1990s. It was almost entirely arranged and composed by frontman [[Rivers Cuomo]], who also anticipated to lead the band in self-producing the album. However, at the behest of DGC, the band was required to include a producer, and collectively opted for [[The Cars|Cars]] frontman [[Ric Ocasek]]. Most of the recording was conducted at [[Electric Lady Studios]] in [[New York City]] between August and September 1993, a period that coincided with founding guitarist [[Jason Cropper]] being fired and replaced by [[Brian Bell]].\n\nUnder Ocasek's direction, the band opted for a brighter sound, while bassist [[Matt Sharp]] collaborated with Cuomo to ensure that the album contained an overriding sonic concept of treating the guitars and bass as isolated ten-string instruments, thus maximizing its potential when united.<ref name=\"Pitchforklist\">{{cite web | last = DiCrescenzo | first = Brent | url = http://www.pitchforkmedia.com/article/feature/36737-staff-list-top-100-albums-of-the-1990s/page_8 | title = Top 100 Albums of the 1990s | publisher = [[Pitchfork Media|Pitchfork]] | accessdate = 2007-09-04 | url-status = dead | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20071023195032/http://www.pitchforkmedia.com/article/feature/36737-staff-list-top-100-albums-of-the-1990s/page_8 | archivedate = October 23, 2007 | df = mdy-all }}</ref> Lyrically, ''Weezer'' focuses on outsiderdom and [[social awkwardness]], while also touching on melancholic themes of love, romance, and familial issues.<ref>https://www.udiscovermusic.com/stories/weezer-blue-album-power-pop/</ref> \n\n''Weezer'' was supported by the singles \"[[Undone \u2013 The Sweater Song]]\", \"[[Buddy Holly (song)|Buddy Holly]]\", and \"[[Say It Ain't So]]\", which, alongside their respective [[music video]]s, brought Weezer mainstream success. The album itself peaked at number sixteen on the [[Billboard 200|US ''Billboard'' 200]], and was certified [[RIAA certification|triple platinum]] by 1995. It is also the band's best-selling album, having sold at least 3.3 million copies in the U.S. and over fifteen million copies worldwide by 2009.<ref>{{cite web |first=Michael D.|last=Ayers| url=http://www.billboard.com/articles/news/267638/weezer-filled-with-raditude-this-fall | title=Weezer Filled With 'Raditude' This Fall | work=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]] | publisher=[[Eldridge Industries]] |location=Los Angeles, California| date=August 21, 2009 | accessdate=October 1, 2012}}</ref>\n\n== Background ==\nWeezer was formed on February 14, 1992, in Los Angeles by singer and guitarist [[Rivers Cuomo]], drummer [[Patrick Wilson (musician)|Patrick Wilson]], bassist [[Matt Sharp]], and guitarist [[Jason Cropper]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.upsetmagazine.com/features/weezer-interview-kings-of-the-world-white-album/|title=Weezer: Kings of the world {{!}} Interview {{!}} Upset|date=2016-05-06|language=en-US|access-date=2016-07-31}}</ref> Although they performed future hits including \"[[The Sweater Song]]\" and \"[[Say It Ain't So]]\", Cuomo said they struggled to engage audiences, who wanted to see [[grunge]] bands instead.<ref>{{harvnb|Luerssen|2004|p=67}}</ref> \n\nIn an effort to create buzz around LA, Weezer recorded a demo, ''[[The Kitchen Tape]]''.<ref>{{harvnb|Luerssen|2004|p=69}}</ref> This attracted attention from major-label A&R reps looking for alternative rock bands to perform on the same bill as [[That Dog]].<ref>{{harvnb|Luerssen|2004|p=76}}</ref> Weezer were signed to [[DGC Records]] on June 26, 1993, by Todd Sullivan, an A&R rep from [[Geffen Records]].<ref>{{harvnb|Luerssen|2004|p=82}}</ref>\n\n== Recording ==\nWhile preparing for the studio sessions, Weezer focused on their vocal interplay by practicing [[barbershop quartet]]-style songs, which helped Cuomo and Sharp feel more comfortable collaborating during rehearsals. Sharp, who had never sung before joining Weezer, developed his [[falsetto]]: \"I had to sing an octave higher than Rivers. After a lot of practice, I started to get it down.\"<ref>{{harvnb|Luerssen|2004|p=85}}</ref>\n\nWeezer rehearsed 15 songs in New York in preparation for the Electric Lady Studios recording sessions. Four songs from this rehearsal would not be attempted for the album: \"Lullaby for Wayne\", \"I Swear It's True\", \"Getting Up and Leaving\", and a reprise version of \"In the Garage\". The other song, an ode to two women who ran the Weezer fanclub called \"Mykel & Carli\", was attempted during the Electric Lady sessions, but was also abandoned (this recording was later released as a digital bonus track on the 2010 compilation ''[[Death to False Metal]]''). A later recording of \"Mykel & Carli\" was featured as a B-side on the \"[[Undone \u2013 The Sweater Song]]\" single.<ref>{{harvnb|Luerssen|2004|pp=88\u201391}}</ref>\n\nThe band considered self-producing, but were pressured by [[Geffen Records|Geffen]] to choose a producer. They decided on [[Ric Ocasek]], who had played with the [[The Cars|Cars]].<ref>{{harvnb|Luerssen|2004|p=87}}</ref> Ocasek convinced the band to change their [[Pick up (music technology)|guitar pickups]] from the neck to the bridge, resulting in a brighter sound.<ref>{{harvnb|Luerssen|2004|p=87}}</ref> Sharp and Cuomo imposed several rules on recording, banning [[Reverberation|reverb]] and insisting on all [[Downpicking|downstrokes]] on guitar.<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-features/weezer-blue-album-25th-anniversary-877089/|title=The Strange Birth and Near Death of Weezer|last=Hiatt|first=Brian|last2=Hiatt|first2=Brian|date=2019-08-28|website=Rolling Stone|language=en-US|access-date=2019-08-30}}</ref> According to engineer Chris Shaw, the \"overriding concept\" was to treat the guitars and bass as a single, 10-string instrument, playing in unison. Weezer insisted that the guitars were mixed as loudly as those in the [[Radiohead]] song \"[[Creep (Radiohead song)|Creep]]\", burying some vocals.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\nDuring the recording, Cropper learned that his girlfriend was pregnant and began acting erratically. Weezer collaborator Karl Koch said: \"He wasn't handling it well ... he always said he was fine, and then 20 minutes later he'd be up on the roof of Electric Lady screaming or something.\"<ref name=\":0\">{{cite web|url=http://www.phawker.com/2014/10/02/excerpt-the-complete-oral-history-of-weezer/|title=EXCERPT: The Complete Oral History of Weezer|last=Valania|first=Jonathan|date=2 October 2014|work=Magnet|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180701140036/http://www.phawker.com/2014/10/02/excerpt-the-complete-oral-history-of-weezer/|archive-date=1 July 2018|url-status=dead|accessdate=22 May 2019}}</ref> According to Cropper, Cuomo told him he could not allow him to jeopardize the band's work and asked him to leave.

In 1994, 70s rock had come to mean either a bastardized version of [[Led Zeppelin]] or a bullshit reconstruction of [[punk rock]]. As guitar nerds, Weezer sought influence there but found true inspiration in forgotten bubblegum power-pop like [[Cheap Trick]], [[Raspberries (band)|Raspberries]], [[20/20 (band)|20/20]], and [[The Quick (U.S. band)|The Quick]]. Most impressively, Rivers Cuomo rescued the thrilling guitar solo from finger-tapping metal and disregarding grunge/punk. A decade later air-guitaring to the album feels far less embarrassing than singing along. With the help of [[Spike Jonze]], Weezer kept joy alive in [[arena rock]], making the critical repositioning of Weezer as some emo touchstone even more absentminded.

It is the sixth installment in the franchise and the fifth installment of the mainline ''[[Devil May Cry]]'' series. Capcom released it for [[Microsoft Windows]], [[PlayStation 4]], and [[Xbox One]] on 8 March 2019. The game takes place five years after ''[[Devil May Cry 4]]'' and follows a trio of warriors with demonic powers: the returning [[Dante (Devil May Cry)|Dante]], [[Nero (Devil May Cry)|Nero]] and a new protagonist named [[List of Devil May Cry characters#V|V]] as they attempt to stop the Demon King [[List of Devil May Cry characters#Urizen|Urizen]] from destroying the human world. Across the game, the player can use these characters in different missions. Each of them has their own way of fighting and becoming stronger. As this happens, the mystery behind V is revealed along with his connection with Urizen.\n\n''Devil May Cry 5'' was directed by [[Hideaki Itsuno]] whose goal was for this installment to be his best work. He aimed to make the game balanced for both newcomers and returning gamers by providing adequate, difficult and new demons. Capcom also wanted to bring a more realistic design inspired by the \"RE Engine\" used in their previous work, ''[[Resident Evil 7: Biohazard]]''. As a result, models were used to make the character's faces. The plot was written by returning writer [[Bingo Morihashi]] while the setting was based on various locations in London. Multiple composers worked together to produce the game's audio, creating three main themes centered around the playable characters.\n\n''Devil May Cry 5'' received positive reviews from critics. Many lauded it as a return to form for the franchise, praising the variety of techniques the three characters bring while also liking the handling of the narrative. It also won multiple game awards in both 2019 and 2020. The game had sold over two million copies less than two weeks after its release, and surpassed three in a year, becoming the top selling game of franchise. A [[light novel]] and [[manga]] related to the game by Morihashi have also been released. \n\n==Gameplay==\n[[File:Devil May Cry 5 Nero gameplay screenshot.jpg|212px|thumb|left|alt=Screengrab of an image of Nero battling demons using his Red Queen sword.| Nero battling demons using his Red Queen sword]]\nThe gameplay features the return of [[Dante (Devil May Cry)|Dante]] and [[Nero (Devil May Cry)|Nero]] as playable characters, along with a new character,<ref name=\"e3-2018\">{{cite web|url=https://www.gameinformer.com/e3-2018/2018/06/10/devil-may-cry-5-announced-features-three-playable-characters|title=Devil May Cry 5 Announced, Features Three Playable Characters|author=Camden Jones|work=[[Game Informer]]|date=10 June 2018|accessdate=18 June 2018|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180612003434/https://www.gameinformer.com/e3-2018/2018/06/10/devil-may-cry-5-announced-features-three-playable-characters|archivedate=12 June 2018}}</ref> named \"V\". The gameplay is similar to that of the other titles in the ''Devil May Cry'' series, focusing on fast-paced \"stylish action\"; The player fights off hordes of demons with a variety of attacks and weapons. They receive a style-rating for combat based on a number of factors, such as move variety, the length of a combo and dodging attacks.

He retains his Red Queen sword for melee combat, and the Blue Rose double-barreled revolver. However, he does not have his demonic arm from the previous game but has an assortment of new robotic arms called Devil Breakers instead. These have a variety of functions like grabbing enemies from a distance or stopping time to freeze an enemy in place. Nero can also find Devil Breakers during stages. Devil Breakers are powerful but fragile, and can be destroyed if used incorrectly.<ref name=\"capcom-unity\">{{cite web |title=E3 2018: Announcing Devil May Cry 5, coming to Xbox One, PS4 and PC in Spring 2019 |url=http://www.capcom-unity.com/devil_may_cry/blog/2018/06/10/e3-2018-announcing-devil-may-cry-5-coming-to-xbox-one-ps4-and-pc-in-spring-2019|date=10 June 2018 |website=[[Capcom|Capcom Unity]] |accessdate=11 June 2018}}</ref> Late in the story, Nero has access to the Devil Trigger move which expands his combat skills.\n\nDante plays like his ''Devil May Cry 4'' persona as he can change between four styles to create new techniques or [[Parry (fencing)|parry]] enemy attacks. Along with his signature blade Rebellion and the demonic sword Sparda, Dante uses two new Devil Arms, a pair of buzzsaw-like weapons that combine into a motorcycle called Cavaliere, and a set of fiery gauntlets and boots called Balrog. Dante also wields a stronger version of the ''Cerberus'' [[nunchaku]] introduced in ''Devil May Cry 3''. He also wears the Dr. Faust, a hat that requires red orbs to attack; it is a risk/reward weapon depending on the player's actions. Dante can use both Kalina Ann from ''Devil May Cry 3'' and the new enhanced Kalina Ann 2 as substitutes for the guns, as well as both versions at the same time.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.gamespot.com/articles/devil-may-cry-5-gets-a-release-date-and-trailer-ga/1100-6461286/|title=Devil May Cry 5 Gets A Release Date And Trailer - Gamescom 2018|first=Chris|last=Reed|date=23 August 2018|access-date=25 September 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180925065503/https://www.gamespot.com/articles/devil-may-cry-5-gets-a-release-date-and-trailer-ga/1100-6461286/|archive-date=25 September 2018|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nThe third playable character, V, who wields a book and a silver cane, uses three demons based on enemies from the first game to fight. These include Griffon, an eagle that uses ranged lightning-based attacks, Shadow, a panther that forms blades, spikes and portals out of its body and Nightmare, a large [[golem]]. V enters a Devil Trigger-like state, which turns his hair white, to summon the golem, which uses a combination of melee attacks and laser beams. Once the enemy's health turns light purple, V uses his cane to finish the battle.<ref name=\"dailytelegraph\"/>\n\n==Plot==\n{{Devil May Cry chronology}}\n{{see also|Characters of Devil May Cry}}\nOn 16 May, devil hunter Nero hunts a demon named Urizen who took his demonic arm and the sword Yamato. Traveling to Red Grave City, he finds a demonic tree called Qliphoth planted in the city, which is killing people for their blood. Dante's group confronts Urizen but, empowered by the Qliphoth, he incapacitates them and overpowers Nero when he intervenes. Dante stops Urizen from capturing Nero, but is defeated and ejected from the Qliphoth with his sword Rebellion shattered. His allies [[Lady (Devil May Cry)|Lady]] and [[Trish (Devil May Cry)|Trish]] are captured to use as demon-cores while a client of Dante, V, convinces the weakened Nero to escape.<ref>{{cite video game|title=Devil May Cry 5|publisher=[[Capcom]]|developer=[[Capcom]]|year=2019|quote='''Urizen:''' I have plans for the both of you.

This contrasts with the beginning of the game when he can not defeat his alter-ego Urizen.<ref name=\"walker\">{{cite web|url=https://kotaku.com/devil-may-cry-5s-director-tells-us-how-they-made-combat-1833642299|title=Devil May Cry 5's Director Tells Us How They Made Combat Feel So Damn Good|publisher=Kotaku|accessdate=April 4, 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190709080028/https://kotaku.com/devil-may-cry-5s-director-tells-us-how-they-made-combat-1833642299|archive-date=9 July 2019|url-status=live}}</ref> His redesign for ''Devil May Cry 5'' is intended to contrast with Dante's older look.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://gearnuke.com/devil-may-cry-5-interview-neros-lineage-design/|title=Devil May Cry 5 Director confirms Nero's lineage and reason for new design|publisher=Gearnuke|author=Danial Arshad Khan|date=16 June 2018|accessdate=20 June 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180619230911/http://gearnuke.com/devil-may-cry-5-interview-neros-lineage-design/|archive-date=19 June 2018|url-status=live}}</ref> Capcom used an older incarnation of Nero, so he would be \"at the top of his game in body and mind\".<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.siliconera.com/2018/07/18/devil-may-cry-5-devs-on-balancing-photorealism-with-action-the-mystery-3rd-hero-more |title= Devil May Cry 5 Devs On Balancing Photorealism With Action, The Mystery 3rd Hero, More |publisher= Siliconera |date= 18 July 2018 |accessdate= 18 July 2018 |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20180718123004/http://www.siliconera.com/2018/07/18/devil-may-cry-5-devs-on-balancing-photorealism-with-action-the-mystery-3rd-hero-more/ |archive-date= 18 July 2018 |url-status= live }}</ref> Because the game's graphics are meant to be as realistic as possible, each character is modeled after an actor.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.dailystar.co.uk/tech/gaming/682955/Devil-May-Cry-5-Nero-Dante-DMC-News-2019-Release-Date-pegi-Devil-Trigger-Updates-August-13|title=Devil May Cry 5: Nero, Dante, new characters, 18+ rating, and 2019 release date news reveal|publisher=Daily Star|accessdate=13 August 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180813113833/https://www.dailystar.co.uk/tech/gaming/682955/Devil-May-Cry-5-Nero-Dante-DMC-News-2019-Release-Date-pegi-Devil-Trigger-Updates-August-13|archive-date=13 August 2018|url-status=live}}</ref> The staff wanted to generate a major emotional scene when Vergil reappears in the climax confronting his brother.

Edwards was a fan of the series since the original 2001 game. He took a liking to Nero's theme from ''Devil May Cry 4'' which attracted him mostly because of the lyric \"I'll endure the exile\".

Capcom confirmed this in no way alters the game's designed progression system, and it is similar to that of ''Devil May Cry 4: Special Edition'', which also allowed for similar in-game purchases.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.gamesradar.com/devil-may-cry-fans-are-divided-on-dmc5s-microtransactions/|title=Devil May Cry fans are divided on DMC5's microtransactions|publisher=Games Radar|accessdate=25 September 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180925032019/https://www.gamesradar.com/devil-may-cry-fans-are-divided-on-dmc5s-microtransactions/|archive-date=25 September 2018|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.gamespot.com/articles/devil-may-cry-5-lets-you-spend-real-money-to-upgra/1100-6461972/|title=Devil May Cry 5 Lets You Spend Real Money To Upgrade Characters|publisher=GameSpot|accessdate=23 September 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180922172916/https://www.gamespot.com/articles/devil-may-cry-5-lets-you-spend-real-money-to-upgra/1100-6461972/|archive-date=22 September 2018|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.dualshockers.com/devil-may-cry-5-microtransactions/|title=Devil May Cry 5 Will Have Microtransactions to Upgrade Characters|publisher=DualShockers|accessdate=23 September 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180923034237/https://www.dualshockers.com/devil-may-cry-5-microtransactions/|archive-date=23 September 2018|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n===Critical response===\n''Devil May Cry 5'' received \"generally favorable reviews\" on all platforms, according to [[review aggregator]] [[Metacritic]].<ref name=\"MCPC\"/><ref name=\"MCPS4\"/><ref name=\"MCXONE\"/> The gameplay and characters were praised.<ref name=\"gamespot\"/><ref name=\"gamespot\"/><ref name=\"pcgameruk\"/><ref name=\"dailytelegraph\"/> ''[[PC Gamer]] UK'' referred to it as \"one of the best games about hitting demons ever made\". The reviewer enjoyed the characters' fightstyles and how performing different techniques rewards the player for their originality in combat.<ref name=\"pcgameruk\"/> ''[[USgamer]]'' found it one of the series' strongest installments. They noted that while the reboot by Ninja Theory was enjoyable, ''Devil May Cry 5'' remained true to the series' core when it came to gameplay mechanics and the handling of the characters.<ref name=\"usgamer\"/> VideoGamer.com praised its gameplay and world building style\u2014particularly its handling of the setting based on London.<ref name=\"vgamer\"/> Similarly, ''[[The Guardian]]'' gave it a perfect score. The reviewer liked how newcomers can easily learn how to score the stylish system in a short time, noting they must also understand the enemies' tactics to beat them and the bosses. ''[[Metro (British newspaper)|Metro]]'' agreed with this assessment.<ref name=\"guardian\"/><ref name=\"metro\"/> ''[[GameSpot]]'' appreciated the depth Capcom offered players, most notably the change in Nero's gameplay to allow different styles of Devil Breaker techniques.<ref name=\"gamespot\"/> ''Metro'' noted that despite the belief that characters move slower than in cutscenes, the gameplay provides the player with the possibility to imitate the cutscenes while performing combos to the point they reach the level of possibility presented by the critically acclaimed action game ''[[Bayonetta]]''.<ref name=\"metro\"/> ''[[Destructoid]]'' enjoyed the multiple types of enemies and boss fights and noted Capcom had responded to criticism of ''Devil May Cry 4'' by providing the player with more stages.<ref name=\"destructoid\"/>\n\nSeveral critics focused on the increased number of moves available to the three protagonists. While giving it a perfect score, ''[[The Daily Telegraph]]'' praised the characters' mechanics, most notably V's for how differently he plays in contrast to Nero and Dante while still remaining entertaining.<ref name=\"dailytelegraph\"/>  ''[[GamesRadar]]'' enjoyed the great variety each of the three playable characters possess in combat while retaining their own style\u2014this, despite Dante playing similarly to his ''Devil May Cry 4'' persona.<ref name=\"gamespot\"/> ''Metro'' noted that while Nero is a character for rookies, Dante's gameplay is far more complex. The reviewer enjoyed the unique gameplay provided by V.<ref name=\"metro\"/> ''GameSpot'' agreed with ''Metro'' on how engaging Nero is to newcomers thanks to his gameplay. They also felt the techniques V presents and how differently he plays from Dante and Nero is impressive.<ref name=\"gamespot\"/> ''[[IGN]]'' liked Nero's new techniques provided by his mechanical arms\u2014most notably the one he shoots to attack enemies. While IGN felt Dante was similar to his presentation in previous games, they noted the new weapons he presents were much more enjoyable. V was also well-received for his interactions with the demons he commands to fight enemies.<ref name=\"IGN Review\" /> Due to some difficulties in handling Nero's Devil Breakers mechanics, ''Destructoid'' felt that Dante and V were the most polished characters to play.<ref name=\"destructoid\"/> Despite enjoying the gameplay, the swapping between characters who need to earn new powers was criticized by ''[[Game Informer]]''.<ref name=\"gameinfor\"/>\n\nThe game's narrative and concept was also the subject of praise by ''IGN'' for its characters and elements of the story, despite the reviewer not finding it very entertaining overall.<ref name=\"IGN Review\" /><ref name=\"vgamer\"/><ref name=\"gameradar\"/> ''IGN''{{'}}s Mitchell Saltzman said \"its mysterious story keeps things interesting along the way.\"<ref name=\"IGN Review\" /> ''GameSpot'' praised the storyline for concluding the crisis the protagonists have across the game, praising their [[character arc]]s even though they are not deep.<ref name=\"gamespot\"/> ''The Guardian'' liked the plot despite finding it simple and noted it took elements from the reboot that were also well-received. Dante's characterization as older than in previous games while  retaining his juvenile personality was also praised by ''The Guardian''.<ref name=\"guardian\"/> ''PCGamer'' enjoyed the story for the portrayal of its characters. The reviewer felt let down by some cutscenes and was critical of Nico.<ref name=\"pcgameruk\"/>  While liking how integral the narrative became in the gameplay mechanics, ''GamesRadar'' felt newcomers might not understand the game's full plot and that the ending was rushed.<ref name=\"gameradar\"/> VideoGamer.com was more critical of the plot, believing the narrative, and villain were \"dull\" despite some interesting interactions in the storyline. While describing it as cheesy and over the top because of on Nero's personality, ''Metro'' found it difficult to know how the story should be taken. They appreciated how ''Devil May Cry 5'' offers the option to show the plot of previous games, making it more accessible in the process.<ref name=\"metro\"/>\n\nAt its launch, the PlayStation 4 version of the game released in western countries included the use of a [[lens flare]] which reduced the visibility of brief nudity. Several gaming journalists referred to it as an act of censorship and reported the change came about as part of a patch for the game. ''IGN'' also noted that another character was similarly censored in all western versions regardless of the platform.<ref>{{Cite

It is the sixth installment in the franchise and the fifth installment of the mainline ''[[Devil May Cry]]'' series. Capcom released it for [[Microsoft Windows]], [[PlayStation 4]], and [[Xbox One]] on 8 March 2019. The game takes place five years after ''[[Devil May Cry 4]]'' and follows a trio of warriors with demonic powers: the returning [[Dante (Devil May Cry)|Dante]], [[Nero (Devil May Cry)|Nero]] and a new protagonist named [[List of Devil May Cry characters#V|V]] as they attempt to stop the Demon King [[List of Devil May Cry characters#Urizen|Urizen]] from destroying the human world. Across the game, the player can use these characters in different missions. Each of them has their own way of fighting and becoming stronger. As this happens, the mystery behind V is revealed along with his connection with Urizen.\n\n''Devil May Cry 5'' was directed by [[Hideaki Itsuno]] whose goal was for this installment to be his best work. He aimed to make the game balanced for both newcomers and returning gamers by providing adequate, difficult and new demons. Capcom also wanted to bring a more realistic design inspired by the \"RE Engine\" used in their previous work, ''[[Resident Evil 7: Biohazard]]''. As a result, models were used to make the character's faces. The plot was written by returning writer [[Bingo Morihashi]] while the setting was based on various locations in London. Multiple composers worked together to produce the game's audio, creating three main themes centered around the playable characters.\n\n''Devil May Cry 5'' received positive reviews from critics. Many lauded it as a return to form for the franchise, praising the variety of techniques the three characters bring while also liking the handling of the narrative. It also won multiple game awards in both 2019 and 2020. The game had sold over two million copies less than two weeks after its release, and surpassed three in a year, becoming the top selling game of franchise. A [[light novel]] and [[manga]] related to the game by Morihashi have also been released. \n\n==Gameplay==\n[[File:Devil May Cry 5 Nero gameplay screenshot.jpg|212px|thumb|left|alt=Screengrab of an image of Nero battling demons using his Red Queen sword.| Nero battling demons using his Red Queen sword]]\nThe gameplay features the return of [[Dante (Devil May Cry)|Dante]] and [[Nero (Devil May Cry)|Nero]] as playable characters, along with a new character,<ref name=\"e3-2018\">{{cite web|url=https://www.gameinformer.com/e3-2018/2018/06/10/devil-may-cry-5-announced-features-three-playable-characters|title=Devil May Cry 5 Announced, Features Three Playable Characters|author=Camden Jones|work=[[Game Informer]]|date=10 June 2018|accessdate=18 June 2018|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180612003434/https://www.gameinformer.com/e3-2018/2018/06/10/devil-may-cry-5-announced-features-three-playable-characters|archivedate=12 June 2018}}</ref> named \"V\".

He retains his Red Queen sword for melee combat, and the Blue Rose double-barreled revolver.

community regarding the decision to include optional in-game purchases where the player can purchase red orbs used to upgrade their character.

The reviewer enjoyed the characters' fightstyles and how performing different techniques rewards the player for their originality in combat.<ref name=\"pcgameruk\"/> ''[[USgamer]]'' found it one of the series' strongest installments. They noted that while the reboot by Ninja Theory was enjoyable, ''Devil May Cry 5'' remained true to the series' core when it came to gameplay mechanics and the handling of the characters.<ref name=\"usgamer\"/> VideoGamer.com praised its gameplay and world building style\u2014particularly its handling of the setting based on London.<ref name=\"vgamer\"/> Similarly, ''[[The Guardian]]'' gave it a perfect score. The reviewer liked how newcomers can easily learn how to score the stylish system in a short time, noting they must also understand the enemies' tactics to beat them and the bosses. ''[[Metro (British newspaper)|Metro]]'' agreed with this assessment.<ref name=\"guardian\"/><ref name=\"metro\"/> ''[[GameSpot]]'' appreciated the depth Capcom offered players, most notably the change in Nero's gameplay to allow different styles of Devil Breaker techniques.<ref name=\"gamespot\"/> ''Metro'' noted that despite the belief that characters move slower than in cutscenes, the gameplay provides the player with the possibility to imitate the cutscenes while performing combos to the point they reach the level of possibility presented by the critically acclaimed action game ''[[Bayonetta]]''.<ref name=\"metro\"/> ''[[Destructoid]]'' enjoyed the multiple types of enemies and boss fights and noted Capcom had responded to criticism of ''Devil May Cry 4'' by providing the player with more stages.<ref name=\"destructoid\"/>\n\nSeveral critics focused on the increased number of moves available to the three protagonists. While giving it a perfect score, ''[[The Daily Telegraph]]'' praised the characters' mechanics, most notably V's for how differently he plays in contrast to Nero and Dante while still remaining entertaining.<ref name=\"dailytelegraph\"/>  ''[[GamesRadar]]'' enjoyed the great variety each of the three playable characters possess in combat while retaining their own style\u2014this, despite Dante playing similarly to his ''Devil May Cry 4'' persona.<ref name=\"gamespot\"/> ''Metro'' noted that while Nero is a character for rookies, Dante's gameplay is far more complex. The reviewer enjoyed the unique gameplay provided by V.<ref name=\"metro\"/> ''GameSpot'' agreed with ''Metro'' on how engaging Nero is to newcomers thanks to his gameplay. They also felt the techniques V presents and how differently he plays from Dante and Nero is impressive.<ref name=\"gamespot\"/> ''[[IGN]]'' liked Nero's new techniques provided by his mechanical arms\u2014most notably the one he shoots to attack enemies. While IGN felt Dante was similar to his presentation in previous games, they noted the new weapons he presents were much more enjoyable. V was also well-received for his interactions with the demons he commands to fight enemies.<ref name=\"IGN Review\" /> Due to some difficulties in handling Nero's Devil Breakers mechanics, ''Destructoid'' felt that Dante and V were the most polished characters to play.<ref name=\"destructoid\"/><!-- while ''[[Game Informer]]'' agreed as he did not find them interesting.<ref name=\"gameinfor\"/> [Not sure what this means!---> Despite enjoying the gameplay, the swapping between characters who need to earn new powers was criticized by ''[[Game Informer]]''.<ref name=\"gameinfor\"/>\n\nThe game's narrative and concept was also the subject of praise by ''IGN'' for its characters and elements of the story, despite the reviewer not finding it very entertaining overall.<ref name=\"IGN Review\" /><ref name=\"vgamer\"/><ref name=\"gameradar\"/> ''IGN''{{'}}s Mitchell Saltzman said \"its mysterious story keeps things interesting along the way.\"<ref name=\"IGN Review\" /> ''GameSpot'' praised the storyline for concluding the crisis the protagonists have across the game, praising their [[character arc]]s even though they are not deep.<ref name=\"gamespot\"/> ''The Guardian'' liked the plot despite finding it simple and noted it took elements from the reboot that were also well-received. Dante's characterization as older than in previous games while  retaining his juvenile personality was also praised by ''The Guardian''.<ref name=\"guardian\"/> ''PCGamer'' enjoyed the story for the portrayal of its characters. The reviewer felt let down by some cutscenes and was critical of Nico.<ref name=\"pcgameruk\"/>  While liking how integral the narrative became in the gameplay mechanics, ''GamesRadar'' felt newcomers might not understand the game's full plot and that the ending was rushed.<ref name=\"gameradar\"/> VideoGamer.com was more critical of the plot, believing the narrative, and villain were \"dull\" despite some interesting interactions in the storyline. <!--noting it still takes the appeal ''Devil May Cry 3'' introduced. [contradictory---><ref name=\"vgamer\"/> While describing it as cheesy and over the top because of on Nero's personality, ''Metro'' found it difficult to know how the story should be taken. They appreciated how ''Devil May Cry 5'' offers the option to show the plot of previous games, making it more accessible in the process.<ref name=\"metro\"/>\n\nAt its launch, the PlayStation 4 version of the game released in western countries included the use of a [[lens flare]] which reduced the visibility of brief nudity. Several gaming journalists referred to it as an act of censorship and reported the change came about as part of a patch for the game. ''IGN'' also noted that another character was similarly censored in all western versions regardless of the platform.<ref>{{Cite

It was granted [[orphan drug]] status by the FDA in 2016.\n\n== History ==\nPAC-1 was discovered in Professor Paul Hergenrother's laboratory at the [[University of Illinois at Urbana\u2013Champaign]] during a process that [[Drug discovery#Screening and design|screened]] many chemicals for anti-tumor potential. This molecule, when delivered to cancer cells, signals the cells to self-destruct by activating an \"executioner\" protein, [[procaspase-3]]. Then, the activated executioner protein begins a cascade of events that destroys the machinery of the cell. In 2011, Vanquish Oncology Inc. was founded to move PAC-1 forward to a human clinical trial. In 2013, Vanquish announced a multimillion-dollar angel investment into the company. In 2015, a phase I clinical trial of PAC-1 opened for enrollment of cancer patients, and in 2016, it was announced that PAC-1 had been granted Orphan Drug Designation for treatment of [[glioblastoma]] by the FDA, and in late 2017 a Phase 1b trial began of PAC-1 plus temozolomide for treatment of patients with recurrent glioblastoma or anaplastic astrocytoma.\n\n== Mechanism of action ==\nIn cells, the executioner protein, caspase-3, is stored in its inactive form, procaspase-3. This way, the cell can quickly undergo apoptosis by activating the protein that is already there. This inactive form is called a [[zymogen]]. Procaspase-3 is known to be inhibited by low levels of zinc.  PAC-1 activates procaspase-3 by chelating zinc, thus relieving the zinc-mediated inhibition.

It was granted [[orphan drug]] status by the FDA in 2016.\n\n== History ==\nPAC-1 was discovered in Professor Paul Hergenrother's laboratory at the [[University of Illinois at Urbana\u2013Champaign]] during a process that [[Drug discovery#Screening and design|screened]] many chemicals for anti-tumor potential. This molecule, when delivered to cancer cells, signals the cells to self-destruct by activating an \"executioner\" protein, [[procaspase-3]]. Then, the activated executioner protein begins a cascade of events that destroys the machinery of the cell. In 2011, Vanquish Oncology Inc. was founded to move PAC-1 forward to a human clinical trial. In 2013, Vanquish announced a multimillion-dollar angel investment into the company. In 2015, a phase I clinical trial of PAC-1 opened for enrollment of cancer patients, and in 2016, it was announced that PAC-1 had been granted Orphan Drug Designation for treatment of [[glioblastoma]] by the FDA, and in late 2017 a Phase 1b trial began of PAC-1 plus temozolomide for treatment of patients with recurrent glioblastoma or anaplastic astrocytoma.\n\n== Mechanism of action ==\nIn cells, the executioner protein, caspase-3, is stored in its inactive form, procaspase-3. This way, the cell can quickly undergo apoptosis by activating the protein that is already there. This inactive form is called a [[zymogen]]. Procaspase-3 is known to be inhibited by low levels of zinc.  PAC-1 activates procaspase-3 by chelating zinc, thus relieving the zinc-mediated inhibition.  This allows procaspase-3 to be an active enzyme, and it can then cleave another molecule of procaspase-3 to active caspase-3.  Caspase-3 can further activate other molecules of procaspase-3 in the cell, causing an exponential increase in caspase-3 concentration. PAC-1 facilitates this process and causes the cell to undergo apoptosis quickly.<ref name=\"Putt\">{{cite journal  |vauthors=Putt KS, Chen GW, Pearson JM, Sandhorst JS, Hoagland MS, Kwon JT, Hwang SK, Jin H, Churchwell MI, Cho MH, Doerge DR, Helferich WG, Hergenrother PJ |title=Small-molecule activation of procaspase-3 to caspase-3 as a personalized anticancer strategy l|volume=2 |issue= 10 |pages= 543\u201350|year= 2006 |pmid= 16936720  | doi=10.1038/nchembio814  | journal=Nature Chemical Biology }}\n</ref>\n\nThis direct procaspase-3 activation mode-of-action for PAC-1 has been confirmed by other laboratories: In 2013 by the Megeney lab during the course of studies on the role of caspase-3 in cardiomyocytes,<ref name=\"Putinski\">{{cite journal  | vauthors=Putinski C, Abdul-Ghani M, Stiles R, Brunette S, Dick SA, Fernando P, Megeney LA |title=Intrinsic-mediated caspase activation is essential for cardiomyocyte hypertrophy |volume=110 |issue= 43 |pages= E4079-87|year= 2013 |pmid= 24101493  | doi=10.1073/pnas.1315587110  | journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences | pmc=3808644}}\n</ref> in 2014 by the Wu lab in an extensive study on the anticancer activity and mode-of-action of PAC-1 and derivatives,<ref name=\"Wang\">{{cite journal  |vauthors=Wang F, Wang L, Zhao Y, Li Y, Ping G, Xiao S, Chen K, Zhu W, Gong P, Yang J, Wu C |title=A novel small-molecule activator of procaspase-3 induces apoptosis in cancer cells and reduces tumor growth in human breast, liver and gallbladder cancer xenografts |volume=8 |issue= 8 |pages= 1640\u20131652|year= 2014 | doi=10.1016/j.molonc.2014.06.015  | journal=Molecular Oncology |pmc=5528581 }}</ref> and in 2015 by the Gandhi lab in an exploration of the potential of PAC-1 and derivative B-PAC-1 for treatment of [[chronic lymphocytic leukemia]] (CLL).<ref name=\"Patel\">{{cite journal  |vauthors=Patel V, Balakrishnan K, Keatin MJ, Wierda WG, Gandhi V |title=Expression of executioner procaspases and their activation by a procaspase-activating compound in chronic lymphocytic leukemia cells |volume=125 |issue= 7 |pages= 1126\u20131136|year= 2015 | doi=10.1182/blood-2014-01-546796  | journal=Blood |pmid=25538042 |pmc=4326772}}\n</ref>\n\nStudies with knockout cells have suggested the importance of procaspase-7 as a secondary or alternate target for PAC-1, especially in the absence of procaspase-3.

More recently, in addition to this single-agent activity PAC-1 has shown to potently synergize with approved cancer drugs, for example with doxorubicin in the treatment of pet dogs with lymphoma and metastatic osteosarcoma,<ref name=\"Botham\">{{cite journal  |vauthors=Botham RC, Roth HS, Book AP, Roady PJ, Fan TM, Hergenrother, PJ |title=Small-Molecule Procaspase-3 Activation Sensitizes Cancer to Treatment with Diverse Chemotherapeutics |volume=2 |pages= 545\u2013559|year= 2016 | doi=10.1021/acscentsci.6b00165  | journal=ACS Central Science|pmc=4999974 }}</ref> and with temozolomide in treating pet dogs with spontaneous glioma.<ref name=\"Joshi\">{{cite journal  |vauthors=Joshi AD, Botham RC, Roth HS, Schlein LJ, Roth HS, Mangraviti A, Borodovsky A, Tyler B, Joslyn S, Looper JS, Podell M, Fan TM, Hergenrother PJ, Riggins GJ |title=Synergistic and targeted therapy with a procaspase-3 activator and temozolomide extends survival in glioma rodent models and is feasible for the treatment of canine malignant glioma patients |volume=8|pages= 80124-80138| |year= 2017 | doi=10.18632/oncotarget.19085  | journal=Oncotarget|pmc=5655184}}</ref>\n\n== Human clinical trials ==\nPAC-1 has been or is currently being tested in the following human clinical trials:\n\n# [https://www.clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT02355535 NCT02355535 - Procaspase Activating Compound-1 (PAC-1) in the Treatment of Advanced Malignancies - Component 1]\n# [https://www.clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT03332355 NCT03332355 - Procaspase Activating Compound-1 (PAC-1) in the Treatment of Advanced Malignancies - Component 2]\n# [https://www.clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT03927248 NCT03927248 - PAC-1 for Treatment of Refractory, Metastatic Kidney Cancer]\n\n<br />\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n{{refbegin|30em}}\n* {{cite journal | last1 = Peterson | first1 = Q.

Minsk was the site of one of the largest Nazi-run [[ghetto]]s in the Second World War, temporarily housing over 100,000 Jews (see [[Minsk Ghetto]]). Some anti-Soviet residents of Minsk, who hoped that Belarus could regain independence, did support the Germans, especially at the beginning of the occupation, but by 1942, Minsk had become a major centre of the [[Soviet partisans|Soviet partisan]] [[resistance movement]] against the invasion, in what is known as the ''[[Eastern Front (World War II)|German-Soviet War]]''. For this role, Minsk was awarded the title ''[[Hero City]]'' in 1974.{{citation needed|date=December 2011}}\n\n{{Main|Minsk Offensive}}\n[[File:Detail of War Memorial - Victory Square - Minsk - Belarus (27427130872).jpg|thumb|War memorial in [[Victory Square, Minsk|Victory Square]], Minsk.]]\n[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 101I-137-1010-37A, Minsk, deutsche Truppen vor modernen Geb\u00e4uden.jpg|left|thumb|German troops marching through Minsk.]]\n\nMinsk was recaptured by Soviet troops on 3 July 1944, during [[Operation Bagration]]. The city was the centre of German resistance to the [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] advance and saw heavy fighting during the first half of 1944. Factories, municipal buildings, [[power station]]s, bridges, most roads and 80% of the houses were reduced to rubble. In 1944, Minsk's population was reduced to a mere 50,000.{{citation needed|date=December 2011}}\n\n[[File:Belarus-Minsk-Railway Station Square-4.jpg|thumb|upright=0.8|Railway Station Square, an example of Stalinist Minsk.]]\nAfter the Second World War, Minsk was rebuilt, but not reconstructed.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://kyky.org/pain/60-raritetnyh-fotografiy-iz-belarusi-ot-1890-do-1980-h|title=60 \u0440\u0430\u0440\u0438\u0442\u0435\u0442\u043d\u044b\u0445 \u0444\u043e\u0442\u043e\u0433\u0440\u0430\u0444\u0438\u0439 \u0438\u0437 \u0411\u0435\u043b\u0430\u0440\u0443\u0441\u0438: \u043e\u0442 1890 \u0434\u043e 1980-\u0445|website=KYKY.ORG|language=ru|access-date=2019-05-31}}</ref> The historical centre was replaced in the 1940s and 1950s by [[Stalinist architecture]], which favoured grand buildings, broad avenues and wide squares.

As the capital of a newly independent country, Minsk quickly acquired the attributes of a major city. Embassies were opened, and a number of Soviet administrative buildings became government centres. During the early and mid-1990s, Minsk was hit by an [[Financial crisis|economic crisis]] and many development projects were halted, resulting in high unemployment and underemployment. Since the late 1990s, there have been improvements in transport and infrastructure, and a housing boom has been underway since 2002. On the outskirts of Minsk, new ''[[Microdistrict|mikroraions]]'' of [[residential area|residential development]] have been built. Metro lines have been extended, and the road system (including the [[MKAD (Minsk)|Minsk BeltWay]]) has been improved.

The average altitude above [[sea level]] is {{convert|220|m}}. The physical geography of Minsk was shaped over the two [[Quaternary glaciation|most recent ice ages]]. The [[Svislach (Berezina)|Svislach River]], which flows across the city from the northwest to the southeast, is in the ''[[urstromtal]]'', an ancient river valley formed by water flowing from melting [[ice sheet]]s at the end of the last Ice Age. There are six smaller rivers within the city limits, all part of the [[Black Sea]] basin.\n\nMinsk is in the area of [[Temperate broadleaf and mixed forests|mixed forests]] typical of most of Belarus. Pinewood and mixed forests border the edge of the city, especially in the north and east. Some of the forests were preserved as parks (for instance, the [[Chelyuskinites Park]]) as the city grew.\n\nThe city was initially built on the hills, which allowed for defensive fortifications, and the western parts of the city are the most hilly.\n\n=== Climate ===\n{{unreferenced section|date=May 2019}}Minsk has a warm summer [[humid continental climate]] ([[K\u00f6ppen climate classification#Warm summer continental or hemiboreal climates|K\u00f6ppen ''Dfb'']]) though unpredictable many a times, owing to its location between the strong influence of the moist air of the [[Atlantic Ocean]] and the dry air of the [[Eurasia]]n landmass. Its weather is unstable and tends to change relatively often. The average January temperature is {{convert|\u22124.5|\u00b0C}}, while the average July temperature is {{convert|18.5|\u00b0C|1|abbr=on}}. The lowest temperature was recorded on 17 January 1940, at {{convert|\u221240|\u00b0C|0|abbr=on}} and the warmest on 8 August 2015 at {{convert|35.8|\u00b0C|0|abbr=on}}. Fog is frequent, especially in the autumn and spring. Minsk receives annual [[precipitation (meteorology)|precipitation]] of {{convert|690|mm|in}}, of which one third falls during the cold period (as snow and rain) and two thirds in the warm period. Throughout the year, most winds are westerly and northwesterly, bringing cool and moist air from the Atlantic. Similar climatic regimes are found in [[Stockholm]], [[Sweden]] and in [[Halifax Regional Municipality|Halifax]], [[Canada]].{{citation needed|date=December 2011}}\n\n{{Clear}}{{Weather box|location=

After the 1569 [[Polish\u2013Lithuanian union]], the city became a destination for migrating Poles (who worked as administrators, clergy, teachers and soldiers) and Jews ([[Ashkenazim]], who worked in the retail trade and as craftsmen, as other opportunities were prohibited by discrimination laws). During the last centuries of the [[Polish\u2013Lithuanian Commonwealth]], many Minsk residents became [[Polonization|polonised]], adopting the language of the dominant Poles and assimilating to its culture.{{citation needed|date=December 2011}}\n\nAfter the second partition of Poland-Lithuania in 1793, Minsk and its larger region became part of the [[Russian Empire]]. The [[Russians]] dominated the city's culture as had the Poles in earlier centuries.{{citation needed|date=December 2011}}\n\nAt the time of the [[Russian Empire Census|1897 census]] under the Russian Empire, Jews were the largest ethnic group in Minsk, at 52% of the population, with 47,500 of the 91,000 residents.<ref>Joshua D. Zimmerman, ''Poles, Jews and the Politics of Nationality'', Univ of Wisconsin Press, 2004, {{ISBN|0-299-19464-7}}, [https://books.google.com/books?id=6sbr9cZyw_4C&pg=PA16&dq=population+Brest+Poles+Jews&lr=&as_brr=3&ei=HS_3SZ2-NITyzQSUtaWtBQ Google Print, p.16]</ref> Other substantial ethnic groups were Russians (25.5%), Poles (11.4%) and Belarusians (9%). The latter figure may be not accurate as some local Belarusians were likely counted as Russians. A small traditional community of [[Lipka Tatars]] had been living in Minsk for centuries.{{citation needed|date=December 2011}}\n\nBetween the 1880s and 1930s many Jews, as well as peasants from other backgrounds, emigrated from the city to the United States as part of a [[Belarusian diaspora]].{{citation needed|date=December 2011}}\n\n[[File:Minsk memorial.JPG|thumb|left|upright=0.9|Jewish [[Holocaust]] memorial]]\nThe high mortality of the First World War and the Second World War affected the demographics of the city, particularly the destruction of Jews under the [[Nazism|Nazi]] occupation of the Second World War. Working through local populations, Germans instituted deportation of Jewish citizens to concentration camps, murdering most of them there. The Jewish community of Minsk suffered catastrophic losses in [[the Holocaust]]. From more than half the population of the city, the percentage of Jews dropped to less than 10% more than ten years after the war. After its limited population peaked in the 1970s, continuing anti-Semitism under the Soviet Union and increasing nationalism in Belarus caused most Jews to emigrate to [[Israel]] and western countries in the 1980s; by 1999, less than 1% of the population of Minsk was Jewish.{{citation needed|date=December 2011}}\n\nIn the first three decades of the post-war years, the most numerous new residents in Minsk were rural migrants from other parts of Belarus; the proportion of ethnic [[Belarusians]] increased markedly. Numerous skilled [[Russians]] and other migrants from other parts of the [[Soviet Union]] migrated for jobs in the growing manufacturing sector.<ref name=\"Zimmerman 2004\">Zimmerman (2004), ''Poles, Jews, and Politics''</ref> In 1959 Belarusians made up 63.3% of the city's residents. Other ethnic groups included Russians (22.8%), Jews (7.8%), Ukrainians (3.6%), Poles (1.1%) and [[Tatars]] (0.4%). Continued migration from rural Belarus in the 1960s and 1970s changed the ethnic composition further. By 1979 Belarusians made up 68.4% of the city's residents. Other ethnic groups included Russians (22.2%), Jews (3.4%), Ukrainians (3.4%), Poles (1.2%) and Tatars (0.2%).<ref name=\"Zimmerman 2004\"/>\n\nAccording to the 1989 census, 82% percent of Minsk residents have been born in Belarus. Of those, 43% have been born in Minsk and 39%&nbsp;\u2013 in other parts of Belarus. 6.2% of Minsk residents came from regions of western Belarus (Grodno and Brest Regions) and 13%&nbsp;\u2013 from eastern Belarus (Mogilev, Vitebsk and Gomel Regions). 21.4% of residents came from central Belarus (Minsk Region).{{citation needed|date=December 2011}}\n\nAccording to the 1999 census, Belarusians make up 79.3% of the city's residents. Other ethnic groups include Russians (15.7%), Ukrainians (2.4%), Poles (1.1%) and Jews (0.6%). The Russian and Ukrainian populations of Minsk peaked in the late 1980s (at 325,000 and 55,000 respectively). After the break-up of the [[Soviet Union]] many of them chose to move to their respective mother countries, although some families had been in Minsk for generations. Another factor in the shifting demographics of the city was the changing self-identification of Minsk residents of mixed ancestry - in independent Belarus they identify as Belarusians.{{citation needed|date=December 2011}}\n\nThe [[Jewish population]] of Minsk peaked in the early 1970s at 50,000 according to official figures; independent estimates put the figure at between 100,000 and 120,000. Beginning in the 1980s, there has been mass-scale emigration to [[Israel]], the US, and Germany. Today only about 10,000 Jews live in Minsk. The traditional minorities of Poles and Tatars have remained at much the same size (17,000 and 3,000 respectively). Rural Poles have migrated from the western part of Belarus to Minsk, and many Tatars have moved to Minsk from [[Tatarstan]].{{citation needed|date=December 2011}}\n\nSome more recent [[minority group|ethnic minority]] communities have developed as a result of immigration. The most prominent are immigrants from the [[Caucasus]] countries \u2013 [[Armenians]], [[Azerbaijani people|Azerbaijanis]] and [[Georgians]] each numbering about 2,000 to 5,000. They began migrating to Minsk in the 1970s, and more immigrants have joined them since. Many work in the [[retailing|retail trade]] in open-air markets. A small but prominent Arab community has developed in Minsk, primarily represented by recent economic immigrants from [[Syria]], [[Lebanon]], [[Egypt]], [[Algeria]], etc. (In many cases, they are graduates of Minsk universities who decide to settle in Belarus and bring over their families). A small community of [[Romani people|Romani]], numbering about 2,000, are settled in suburbs of north-western and southern Minsk.{{citation needed|date=December 2011}}\n\n=== Languages ===\n\nThroughout its history Minsk has been a city of many languages. Initially most of its residents spoke [[Ruthenian language|Ruthenian]] (which later developed into modern [[Belarusian language|Belarusian]]). However, after 1569 the [[official language]] was [[Dialects of Polish#Northern Kresy dialect|Polish.]]<ref>Mi\u0119dzy Wschodem i Zachodem: international conference, Lublin, 18\u201321 June 1991</ref> In the 19th-century Russian became the official language and by the end of that century it had become the language of administration, schools and newspapers. The Belarusian national revival increased interest in the Belarusian language \u2013 its use has grown since the 1890s, especially among the [[intelligentsia]]. In the 1920s and early 1930s Belarusian was the major language of Minsk, including use for administration and education (both secondary and tertiary). However, since the late 1930s Russian again began gaining dominance.{{citation needed|date=December 2011}}\n\nA short period of Belarusian national revival in the early 1990s saw a rise in the numbers of Belarusian speakers. However, in 1994 the newly elected president [[Alexander Lukashenko]] slowly reversed this trend. Most residents of Minsk now use Russian exclusively in their everyday lives at home and at work, although Belarusian is understood as well. Substantial numbers of recent migrants from the rural areas use [[Trasianka|Trasyanka]] (a Russo-Belarusian mixed language) in their everyday lives.{{citation needed|date=December 2011}}\n\nThe most commonly used and understood [[foreign language]] in Minsk, especially among the younger generation, is English.<ref>{{cite journal|last=\u00d6stlund |first=Anders |title=LANGUAGES |date=13 July 2013 |url=http://fryday.net/languages/ |accessdate=29 October 2013 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131103021111/http://fryday.net/languages/ |archivedate=3 November 2013}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Chinese sinage, Main Railway Station, Minsk, Belarus.jpg|thumb|upright=0.8|left|Chinese signage, Minsk railway station (2018)]]\n\n=== Religion ===\nThere are no reliable statistics on the religious affiliations of those living in Minsk, or among the population of Belarus generally. The majority of Christians belong to the [[Belarusian Orthodox Church]], which is the exarchate of the [[Russian Orthodox Church]] in Belarus. There is a significant minority of [[Roman Catholic Church|Roman Catholics]].{{citation needed|date=December 2011}}\n\nAs of 2006, there are approximately 30 religious communities of various

Its industrial development started in the 1860s and was facilitated by the railways built in the 1870s. However, much of the industrial infrastructure was destroyed during World War I and especially during World War II. After the last war the development of the city was linked to the development of industry, especially of [[Research and development|R&D]]-intensive sectors (heavy emphasis of R&D intensive industries in [[urban planning|urban development]] in the USSR is known in Western geography as 'Minsk phenomenon').{{citation needed|date=November 2011}} Minsk was turned into a major production site for trucks, tractors, gears, optical equipment, refrigerators, television sets and radios, bicycles, motorcycles, watches, and metal-processing equipment. Outside machine-building and electronics, Minsk also had textiles, construction materials, food processing, and printing industries. During the Soviet period, development of the industries was linked to suppliers and markets within the USSR, and the break-up of the union in 1991 led to a serious economic meltdown in 1991\u20131994. {{citation needed|date=November 2011}}\n\nHowever, since the adoption of the neo-Keynesean policies under [[Alexander Lukashenko]]'s government in 1995, much of the gross industrial production was regained.{{citation needed|date=August 2014}} Unlike many other cities in the CIS and Eastern Europe Minsk was not heavily de-industrialised in the 1990s.

Construction of the metro began in 1977, soon after the city reached over a million people, and the first line with 8 stations was opened in 1984. Since then it has expanded into two lines: [[Masko\u016dskaja Line|Masko\u016dskaja]] and [[A\u016dtazavodskaja Line|A\u016dtazavodskaja]], which are {{convert|18.1|and|17.3|km|mi|abbr=on}} long with 14 and 14 stations, respectively. On 7 November 2012, three new stations on the Moskovskaya Line were opened; work continues on a {{convert|1.8|km|mi|abbr=on}} extension, with one more station slated to open in 2014.{{citation needed|date=December 2011}}\n\nThere are plans for a network with three lines totalling (based on present expansion plans) {{convert|58.3|km|mi|abbr=on}} of track with 45 stations and three train depots. For this to happen the third line should cut the city on a north\u2013south axis crossing the existing two and thus forming a typical Soviet triangle layout; construction of the third line is expected to begin in 2011 and for the first stage to be delivered in the late 2010s. Some layout plans speculate on a possible fourth line running from Vyasnyanka to Serabranka micro-rayons.{{citation needed|date=December 2011}}\n\n{{As of|2013}} Minsk metro had 28 stations and {{convert|35.5|km|0|abbr=off}} of tracks. Trains use 243 standard Russian metro-cars. On a typical day Minsk metro is used by 800,000 passengers. In 2007 ridership of Minsk metro was 262.1 million passengers,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mrl.ucsb.edu/~yopopov/rrt/maps/statistics.html |title=CIS Metro Statistics |publisher=Mrl.ucsb.edu |date=21 June 2010 |accessdate=4 July 2010}}</ref> in 2017 ridership of Minsk metro was 284,1 million passengers,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://metropoliten.by/o_metropolitene/metro_today |title=\u041c\u0435\u0442\u0440\u043e \u0441\u0435\u0433\u043e\u0434\u043d\u044f |publisher=metropoliten.b|date=2018 |accessdate=}}</ref>\nmaking it the 5th busiest metro network in the [[Post-Soviet states|former USSR]] (behind Moscow, [[Saint Petersburg|St. Petersburg]], [[Kiev]] and [[Kharkiv]]). During peak hours trains run each 2\u20132.5 minutes. The metro network employs 3,200 staff.{{citation needed|date=December 2011}}\n\nCurrently most of the urban transport is being actively renovated and upgraded to modern standards. For instance, all metro stations built since 2001 have passenger lifts from platform to street level, thus enabling the use of the newer stations by disabled passengers.{{citation needed|date=December 2011}}\n\n=== Railway and intercity bus ===\n[[File:Belarus-Minsk-Central Bus Station.jpg|thumb|Minsk Central Bus Station]]\n[[File:Minsk-Central-Bus-Station.jpg|thumb|Minsk Central Bus Station Nowadays]]\n\nMinsk is the largest transport hub in Belarus. Minsk is located at the junction of the [[Warsaw]]-Moscow railway (built in 1871) running from the southwest to the northeast of the city and the [[Liep\u0101ja|Liepaja]]-[[Romny]] railway (built in 1873) running from the northwest to the south. The first railway connects Russia with Poland and Germany; the second connects Ukraine with Lithuania and Latvia. They cross at the [[Minsk Passazhirsky railway station|Minsk-''Pasa\u017eyrski'']] railway station, the main railway station of Minsk. The station was built in 1873 as ''Vilenski vakzal''. The initial wooden building was demolished in 1890 and rebuilt in stone. During World War II the Minsk railway station was completely destroyed. It was rebuilt in 1945 and 1946 and served until 1991. The new building of the Minsk-''Pasa\u017eyrski'' railway station was built during 1991\u20132002. Its construction was delayed due to financial difficulties; now, however, Minsk boasts one of the most modern and up-to-date railway stations in the CIS. There are plans to move all [[Regional rail|suburban rail]] traffic from Minsk-''Pasa\u017eyrski'' to the smaller stations, Minsk-\n''Uschodni'' (East), Minsk-''Pa\u016ddniovy'' (South) and Minsk-''Pa\u016dno\u010dny'' (North), by 2020.{{citation needed|date=December 2011}}\n\nThere are three intercity bus stations that link Minsk with the suburbs and other cities in Belarus and the neighboring countries. Frequent schedules of bus routes connect Minsk to Moscow, [[Smolensk]], [[Vilnius]], [[Riga]], [[Kiev]] and [[Warsaw]].{{citation needed|date=December 2011}}\n\n=== Airports ===\n\n[[Minsk National Airport]] is located {{convert|42|km|mi|abbr=on}} to the east of the city. It opened in 1982 and the current [[railway station]] opened in 1987. It is an [[international airport]] with flights to Europe and the Middle East.{{citation needed|date=December 2011}}\n\n'''[[Minsk-1 Airport|Minsk-1]]''' opened in 1933 a few kilometres to the south of the historical centre. In 1955 it became an international airport and by 1970 served over 1&nbsp;million passengers a year.{{citation needed|date=December 2011}}\n\nFrom 1982 it mainly served domestic routes in Belarus and short-haul routes to Moscow, [[Kiev]] and [[Kaliningrad]]. Minsk-1 was expected to be closed in 2008 because of the noise pollution in the surrounding residential areas, but in the mid-2010 it is still functioning. The land of the airport is planned to be redeveloped for residential and commercial real estate, currently branded as [[Minsk-City]].{{citation needed|date=December 2011}}\n\nMinsk Borovaya Airfield (UMMB) is situated in a suburb north-east of the city, next to Zaliony Luh Forest Park, housing Aero Club Minsk and Minsk Aviation Museum.<ref>{{Cite web | url=https://www.world-airport-codes.com/belarus/borovaya-airfield-82793.html | title=Borovaya Airfield - Belarus}}</ref>\n\n== Education ==\nIt has about 451 kindergartens, 241 schools, 22 further education colleges,<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://minsk.edu.by/|script-title=ru:\u043a\u043e\u043c\u0438\u0442\u0435\u0442 \u043f\u043e \u043e\u0431\u0440\u0430\u0437\u043e\u0432\u0430\u043d\u0438\u044e \u041c\u0438\u043d\u0433\u043e\u0440\u0438\u0441\u043f\u043e\u043b\u043a\u043e\u043c\u0430|trans-title=Committee of Education (Minsk City Executive Committee)|language=ru|accessdate=23 July 2018}}</ref> and 29 higher education institutions,<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://edu.gov.by/sistema-obrazovaniya/glavnoe-upravlenie-professionalnogo-obrazovaniya/vysshee-obrazovanie/|script-title=ru:\u0423\u043f\u0440\u0430\u0432\u043b\u0435\u043d\u0438\u0435 \u0432\u044b\u0441\u0448\u0435\u0433\u043e \u043e\u0431\u0440\u0430\u0437\u043e\u0432\u0430\u043d\u0438\u044f|trans-title=the management of higher education|language=ru|accessdate=23 July 2018|publisher=Ministry of education of the Republic of Belarus}}</ref> including 12 major national universities. {{citation needed|date=November 2011}}\n\n=== Major higher educational institutions ===\n\n*[[Academy of Public Administration (Belarus)|Academy of Public Administration under the aegis of the President of the Republic of Belarus]].

Minsk was the site of one of the largest Nazi-run [[ghetto]]s in the Second World War, temporarily housing over 100,000 Jews (see [[Minsk Ghetto]]). Some anti-Soviet residents of Minsk, who hoped that Belarus could regain independence, did support the Germans, especially at the beginning of the occupation, but by 1942, Minsk had become a major centre of the [[Soviet partisans|Soviet partisan]] [[resistance movement]] against the invasion, in what is known as the ''[[Eastern Front (World War II)|German-Soviet War]]''. For this role, Minsk was awarded the title ''[[Hero City]]'' in 1974.{{citation needed|date=December 2011}}\n\n{{Main|Minsk Offensive}}\n[[File:Detail of War Memorial - Victory Square - Minsk - Belarus (27427130872).jpg|thumb|War memorial in [[Victory Square, Minsk|Victory Square]], Minsk.]]\n[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 101I-137-1010-37A, Minsk, deutsche Truppen vor modernen Geb\u00e4uden.jpg|left|thumb|German troops marching through Minsk.]]\n\nMinsk was recaptured by Soviet troops on 3 July 1944, during [[Operation Bagration]]. The city was the centre of German resistance to the [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] advance and saw heavy fighting during the first half of 1944. Factories, municipal buildings, [[power station]]s, bridges, most roads and 80% of the houses were reduced to rubble. In 1944, Minsk's population was reduced to a mere 50,000.{{citation needed|date=December 2011}}\n\n[[File:Belarus-Minsk-Railway Station Square-4.jpg|thumb|upright=0.8|Railway Station Square, an example of Stalinist Minsk.]]\nAfter the Second World War, Minsk was rebuilt, but not reconstructed.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://kyky.org/pain/60-raritetnyh-fotografiy-iz-belarusi-ot-1890-do-1980-h|title=60 \u0440\u0430\u0440\u0438\u0442\u0435\u0442\u043d\u044b\u0445 \u0444\u043e\u0442\u043e\u0433\u0440\u0430\u0444\u0438\u0439 \u0438\u0437 \u0411\u0435\u043b\u0430\u0440\u0443\u0441\u0438: \u043e\u0442 1890 \u0434\u043e 1980-\u0445|website=KYKY.ORG|language=ru|access-date=2019-05-31}}</ref> The historical centre was replaced in the 1940s and 1950s by [[Stalinist architecture]], which favoured grand buildings, broad avenues and wide squares.

As the capital of a newly independent country, Minsk quickly acquired the attributes of a major city. Embassies were opened, and a number of Soviet administrative buildings became government centres. During the early and mid-1990s, Minsk was hit by an [[Financial crisis|economic crisis]] and many development projects were halted, resulting in high unemployment and underemployment. Since the late 1990s, there have been improvements in transport and infrastructure, and a housing boom has been underway since 2002. On the outskirts of Minsk, new ''[[Microdistrict|mikroraions]]'' of [[residential area|residential development]] have been built. Metro lines have been extended, and the road system (including the [[MKAD (Minsk)|Minsk BeltWay]]) has been improved.

The average altitude above [[sea level]] is {{convert|220|m}}. The physical geography of Minsk was shaped over the two [[Quaternary glaciation|most recent ice ages]]. The [[Svislach (Berezina)|Svislach River]], which flows across the city from the northwest to the southeast, is in the ''[[urstromtal]]'', an ancient river valley formed by water flowing from melting [[ice sheet]]s at the end of the last Ice Age. There are six smaller rivers within the city limits, all part of the [[Black Sea]] basin.\n\nMinsk is in the area of [[Temperate broadleaf and mixed forests|mixed forests]] typical of most of Belarus. Pinewood and mixed forests border the edge of the city, especially in the north and east. Some of the forests were preserved as parks (for instance, the [[Chelyuskinites Park]]) as the city grew.\n\nThe city was initially built on the hills, which allowed for defensive fortifications, and the western parts of the city are the most hilly.\n\n=== Climate ===\n{{unreferenced section|date=May 2019}}Minsk has a warm summer [[humid continental climate]] ([[K\u00f6ppen climate classification#Warm summer continental or hemiboreal climates|K\u00f6ppen ''Dfb'']]) though unpredictable many a times, owing to its location between the strong influence of the moist air of the [[Atlantic Ocean]] and the dry air of the [[Eurasia]]n landmass. Its weather is unstable and tends to change relatively often. The average January temperature is {{convert|\u22124.5|\u00b0C}}, while the average July temperature is {{convert|18.5|\u00b0C|1|abbr=on}}. The lowest temperature was recorded on 17 January 1940, at {{convert|\u221240|\u00b0C|0|abbr=on}} and the warmest on 8 August 2015 at {{convert|35.8|\u00b0C|0|abbr=on}}. Fog is frequent, especially in the autumn and spring. Minsk receives annual [[precipitation (meteorology)|precipitation]] of {{convert|690|mm|in}}, of which one third falls during the cold period (as snow and rain) and two thirds in the warm period. Throughout the year, most winds are westerly and northwesterly, bringing cool and moist air from the Atlantic. Similar climatic regimes are found in [[Stockholm]], [[Sweden]] and in [[Halifax Regional Municipality|Halifax]], [[Canada]].{{citation needed|date=December 2011}}\n\n{{Clear}}{{Weather box|location=

After the 1569 [[Polish\u2013Lithuanian union]], the city became a destination for migrating Poles (who worked as administrators, clergy, teachers and soldiers) and Jews ([[Ashkenazim]], who worked in the retail trade and as craftsmen, as other opportunities were prohibited by discrimination laws). During the last centuries of the [[Polish\u2013Lithuanian Commonwealth]], many Minsk residents became [[Polonization|polonised]], adopting the language of the dominant Poles and assimilating to its culture.{{citation needed|date=December 2011}}\n\nAfter the second partition of Poland-Lithuania in 1793, Minsk and its larger region became part of the [[Russian Empire]]. The [[Russians]] dominated the city's culture as had the Poles in earlier centuries.{{citation needed|date=December 2011}}\n\nAt the time of the [[Russian Empire Census|1897 census]] under the Russian Empire, Jews were the largest ethnic group in Minsk, at 52% of the population, with 47,500 of the 91,000 residents.<ref>Joshua D. Zimmerman, ''Poles, Jews and the Politics of Nationality'', Univ of Wisconsin Press, 2004, {{ISBN|0-299-19464-7}}, [https://books.google.com/books?id=6sbr9cZyw_4C&pg=PA16&dq=population+Brest+Poles+Jews&lr=&as_brr=3&ei=HS_3SZ2-NITyzQSUtaWtBQ Google Print, p.16]</ref> Other substantial ethnic groups were Russians (25.5%), Poles (11.4%) and Belarusians (9%). The latter figure may be not accurate as some local Belarusians were likely counted as Russians. A small traditional community of [[Lipka Tatars]] had been living in Minsk for centuries.{{citation needed|date=December 2011}}\n\nBetween the 1880s and 1930s many Jews, as well as peasants from other backgrounds, emigrated from the city to the United States as part of a [[Belarusian diaspora]].{{citation needed|date=December 2011}}\n\n[[File:Minsk memorial.JPG|thumb|left|upright=0.9|Jewish [[Holocaust]] memorial]]\nThe high mortality of the First World War and the Second World War affected the demographics of the city, particularly the destruction of Jews under the [[Nazism|Nazi]] occupation of the Second World War. Working through local populations, Germans instituted deportation of Jewish citizens to concentration camps, murdering most of them there. The Jewish community of Minsk suffered catastrophic losses in [[the Holocaust]]. From more than half the population of the city, the percentage of Jews dropped to less than 10% more than ten years after the war. After its limited population peaked in the 1970s, continuing anti-Semitism under the Soviet Union and increasing nationalism in Belarus caused most Jews to emigrate to [[Israel]] and western countries in the 1980s; by 1999, less than 1% of the population of Minsk was Jewish.{{citation needed|date=December 2011}}\n\nIn the first three decades of the post-war years, the most numerous new residents in Minsk were rural migrants from other parts of Belarus; the proportion of ethnic [[Belarusians]] increased markedly. Numerous skilled [[Russians]] and other migrants from other parts of the [[Soviet Union]] migrated for jobs in the growing manufacturing sector.<ref name=\"Zimmerman 2004\">Zimmerman (2004), ''Poles, Jews, and Politics''</ref> In 1959 Belarusians made up 63.3% of the city's residents. Other ethnic groups included Russians (22.8%), Jews (7.8%), Ukrainians (3.6%), Poles (1.1%) and [[Tatars]] (0.4%). Continued migration from rural Belarus in the 1960s and 1970s changed the ethnic composition further. By 1979 Belarusians made up 68.4% of the city's residents. Other ethnic groups included Russians (22.2%), Jews (3.4%), Ukrainians (3.4%), Poles (1.2%) and Tatars (0.2%).<ref name=\"Zimmerman 2004\"/>\n\nAccording to the 1989 census, 82% percent of Minsk residents have been born in Belarus. Of those, 43% have been born in Minsk and 39%&nbsp;\u2013 in other parts of Belarus. 6.2% of Minsk residents came from regions of western Belarus (Grodno and Brest Regions) and 13%&nbsp;\u2013 from eastern Belarus (Mogilev, Vitebsk and Gomel Regions). 21.4% of residents came from central Belarus (Minsk Region).{{citation needed|date=December 2011}}\n\nAccording to the 1999 census, Belarusians make up 79.3% of the city's residents. Other ethnic groups include Russians (15.7%), Ukrainians (2.4%), Poles (1.1%) and Jews (0.6%). The Russian and Ukrainian populations of Minsk peaked in the late 1980s (at 325,000 and 55,000 respectively). After the break-up of the [[Soviet Union]] many of them chose to move to their respective mother countries, although some families had been in Minsk for generations. Another factor in the shifting demographics of the city was the changing self-identification of Minsk residents of mixed ancestry - in independent Belarus they identify as Belarusians.{{citation needed|date=December 2011}}\n\nThe [[Jewish population]] of Minsk peaked in the early 1970s at 50,000 according to official figures; independent estimates put the figure at between 100,000 and 120,000. Beginning in the 1980s, there has been mass-scale emigration to [[Israel]], the US, and Germany. Today only about 10,000 Jews live in Minsk. The traditional minorities of Poles and Tatars have remained at much the same size (17,000 and 3,000 respectively). Rural Poles have migrated from the western part of Belarus to Minsk, and many Tatars have moved to Minsk from [[Tatarstan]].{{citation needed|date=December 2011}}\n\nSome more recent [[minority group|ethnic minority]] communities have developed as a result of immigration. The most prominent are immigrants from the [[Caucasus]] countries \u2013 [[Armenians]], [[Azerbaijani people|Azerbaijanis]] and [[Georgians]] each numbering about 2,000 to 5,000. They began migrating to Minsk in the 1970s, and more immigrants have joined them since. Many work in the [[retailing|retail trade]] in open-air markets. A small but prominent Arab community has developed in Minsk, primarily represented by recent economic immigrants from [[Syria]], [[Lebanon]], [[Egypt]], [[Algeria]], etc. (In many cases, they are graduates of Minsk universities who decide to settle in Belarus and bring over their families). A small community of [[Romani people|Romani]], numbering about 2,000, are settled in suburbs of north-western and southern Minsk.{{citation needed|date=December 2011}}\n\n=== Languages ===\n\nThroughout its history Minsk has been a city of many languages. Initially most of its residents spoke [[Ruthenian language|Ruthenian]] (which later developed into modern [[Belarusian language|Belarusian]]). However, after 1569 the [[official language]] was [[Dialects of Polish#Northern Kresy dialect|Polish.]]<ref>Mi\u0119dzy Wschodem i Zachodem: international conference, Lublin, 18\u201321 June 1991</ref> In the 19th-century Russian became the official language and by the end of that century it had become the language of administration, schools and newspapers. The Belarusian national revival increased interest in the Belarusian language \u2013 its use has grown since the 1890s, especially among the [[intelligentsia]]. In the 1920s and early 1930s Belarusian was the major language of Minsk, including use for administration and education (both secondary and tertiary). However, since the late 1930s Russian again began gaining dominance.{{citation needed|date=December 2011}}\n\nA short period of Belarusian national revival in the early 1990s saw a rise in the numbers of Belarusian speakers. However, in 1994 the newly elected president [[Alexander Lukashenko]] slowly reversed this trend. Most residents of Minsk now use Russian exclusively in their everyday lives at home and at work, although Belarusian is understood as well. Substantial numbers of recent migrants from the rural areas use [[Trasianka|Trasyanka]] (a Russo-Belarusian mixed language) in their everyday lives.{{citation needed|date=December 2011}}\n\nThe most commonly used and understood [[foreign language]] in Minsk, especially among the younger generation, is English.<ref>{{cite journal|last=\u00d6stlund |first=Anders |title=LANGUAGES |date=13 July 2013 |url=http://fryday.net/languages/ |accessdate=29 October 2013 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131103021111/http://fryday.net/languages/ |archivedate=3 November 2013}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Chinese sinage, Main Railway Station, Minsk, Belarus.jpg|thumb|upright=0.8|left|Chinese signage, Minsk railway station (2018)]]\n\n=== Religion ===\nThere are no reliable statistics on the religious affiliations of those living in Minsk, or among the population of Belarus generally. The majority of Christians belong to the [[Belarusian Orthodox Church]], which is the exarchate of the [[Russian Orthodox Church]] in Belarus. There is a significant minority of [[Roman Catholic Church|Roman Catholics]].{{citation needed|date=December 2011}}\n\nAs of 2006, there are approximately 30 religious communities of various

Its industrial development started in the 1860s and was facilitated by the railways built in the 1870s. However, much of the industrial infrastructure was destroyed during World War I and especially during World War II. After the last war the development of the city was linked to the development of industry, especially of [[Research and development|R&D]]-intensive sectors (heavy emphasis of R&D intensive industries in [[urban planning|urban development]] in the USSR is known in Western geography as 'Minsk phenomenon').{{citation needed|date=November 2011}} Minsk was turned into a major production site for trucks, tractors, gears, optical equipment, refrigerators, television sets and radios, bicycles, motorcycles, watches, and metal-processing equipment. Outside machine-building and electronics, Minsk also had textiles, construction materials, food processing, and printing industries. During the Soviet period, development of the industries was linked to suppliers and markets within the USSR, and the break-up of the union in 1991 led to a serious economic meltdown in 1991\u20131994. {{citation needed|date=November 2011}}\n\nHowever, since the adoption of the neo-Keynesean policies under [[Alexander Lukashenko]]'s government in 1995, much of the gross industrial production was regained.{{citation needed|date=August 2014}} Unlike many other cities in the CIS and Eastern Europe Minsk was not heavily de-industrialised in the 1990s.

Construction of the metro began in 1977, soon after the city reached over a million people, and the first line with 8 stations was opened in 1984. Since then it has expanded into two lines: [[Masko\u016dskaja Line|Masko\u016dskaja]] and [[A\u016dtazavodskaja Line|A\u016dtazavodskaja]], which are {{convert|18.1|and|17.3|km|mi|abbr=on}} long with 14 and 14 stations, respectively. On 7 November 2012, three new stations on the Moskovskaya Line were opened; work continues on a {{convert|1.8|km|mi|abbr=on}} extension, with one more station slated to open in 2014.{{citation needed|date=December 2011}}\n\nThere are plans for a network with three lines totalling (based on present expansion plans) {{convert|58.3|km|mi|abbr=on}} of track with 45 stations and three train depots. For this to happen the third line should cut the city on a north\u2013south axis crossing the existing two and thus forming a typical Soviet triangle layout; construction of the third line is expected to begin in 2011 and for the first stage to be delivered in the late 2010s. Some layout plans speculate on a possible fourth line running from Vyasnyanka to Serabranka micro-rayons.{{citation needed|date=December 2011}}\n\n{{As of|2013}} Minsk metro had 28 stations and {{convert|35.5|km|0|abbr=off}} of tracks. Trains use 243 standard Russian metro-cars. On a typical day Minsk metro is used by 800,000 passengers. In 2007 ridership of Minsk metro was 262.1 million passengers,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mrl.ucsb.edu/~yopopov/rrt/maps/statistics.html |title=CIS Metro Statistics |publisher=Mrl.ucsb.edu |date=21 June 2010 |accessdate=4 July 2010}}</ref> in 2017 ridership of Minsk metro was 284,1 million passengers,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://metropoliten.by/o_metropolitene/metro_today |title=\u041c\u0435\u0442\u0440\u043e \u0441\u0435\u0433\u043e\u0434\u043d\u044f |publisher=metropoliten.b|date=2018 |accessdate=}}</ref>\nmaking it the 5th busiest metro network in the [[Post-Soviet states|former USSR]] (behind Moscow, [[Saint Petersburg|St. Petersburg]], [[Kiev]] and [[Kharkiv]]). During peak hours trains run each 2\u20132.5 minutes. The metro network employs 3,200 staff.{{citation needed|date=December 2011}}\n\nCurrently most of the urban transport is being actively renovated and upgraded to modern standards. For instance, all metro stations built since 2001 have passenger lifts from platform to street level, thus enabling the use of the newer stations by disabled passengers.{{citation needed|date=December 2011}}\n\n=== Railway and intercity bus ===\n[[File:Belarus-Minsk-Central Bus Station.jpg|thumb|Minsk Central Bus Station]]\n[[File:Minsk-Central-Bus-Station.jpg|thumb|Minsk Central Bus Station Nowadays]]\n\nMinsk is the largest transport hub in Belarus. Minsk is located at the junction of the [[Warsaw]]-Moscow railway (built in 1871) running from the southwest to the northeast of the city and the [[Liep\u0101ja|Liepaja]]-[[Romny]] railway (built in 1873) running from the northwest to the south. The first railway connects Russia with Poland and Germany; the second connects Ukraine with Lithuania and Latvia. They cross at the [[Minsk Passazhirsky railway station|Minsk-''Pasa\u017eyrski'']] railway station, the main railway station of Minsk. The station was built in 1873 as ''Vilenski vakzal''. The initial wooden building was demolished in 1890 and rebuilt in stone. During World War II the Minsk railway station was completely destroyed. It was rebuilt in 1945 and 1946 and served until 1991. The new building of the Minsk-''Pasa\u017eyrski'' railway station was built during 1991\u20132002. Its construction was delayed due to financial difficulties; now, however, Minsk boasts one of the most modern and up-to-date railway stations in the CIS. There are plans to move all [[Regional rail|suburban rail]] traffic from Minsk-''Pasa\u017eyrski'' to the smaller stations, Minsk-\n''Uschodni'' (East), Minsk-''Pa\u016ddniovy'' (South) and Minsk-''Pa\u016dno\u010dny'' (North), by 2020.{{citation needed|date=December 2011}}\n\nThere are three intercity bus stations that link Minsk with the suburbs and other cities in Belarus and the neighboring countries. Frequent schedules of bus routes connect Minsk to Moscow, [[Smolensk]], [[Vilnius]], [[Riga]], [[Kiev]] and [[Warsaw]].{{citation needed|date=December 2011}}\n\n=== Airports ===\n\n[[Minsk National Airport]] is located {{convert|42|km|mi|abbr=on}} to the east of the city. It opened in 1982 and the current [[railway station]] opened in 1987. It is an [[international airport]] with flights to Europe and the Middle East.{{citation needed|date=December 2011}}\n\n'''[[Minsk-1 Airport|Minsk-1]]''' opened in 1933 a few kilometres to the south of the historical centre. In 1955 it became an international airport and by 1970 served over 1&nbsp;million passengers a year.{{citation needed|date=December 2011}}\n\nFrom 1982 it mainly served domestic routes in Belarus and short-haul routes to Moscow, [[Kiev]] and [[Kaliningrad]]. Minsk-1 was expected to be closed in 2008 because of the noise pollution in the surrounding residential areas, but in the mid-2010 it is still functioning. The land of the airport is planned to be redeveloped for residential and commercial real estate, currently branded as [[Minsk-City]].{{citation needed|date=December 2011}}\n\nMinsk Borovaya Airfield (UMMB) is situated in a suburb north-east of the city, next to Zaliony Luh Forest Park, housing Aero Club Minsk and Minsk Aviation Museum.<ref>{{Cite web | url=https://www.world-airport-codes.com/belarus/borovaya-airfield-82793.html | title=Borovaya Airfield - Belarus}}</ref>\n\n== Education ==\nIt has about 451 kindergartens, 241 schools, 22 further education colleges,<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://minsk.edu.by/|script-title=ru:\u043a\u043e\u043c\u0438\u0442\u0435\u0442 \u043f\u043e \u043e\u0431\u0440\u0430\u0437\u043e\u0432\u0430\u043d\u0438\u044e \u041c\u0438\u043d\u0433\u043e\u0440\u0438\u0441\u043f\u043e\u043b\u043a\u043e\u043c\u0430|trans-title=Committee of Education (Minsk City Executive Committee)|language=ru|accessdate=23 July 2018}}</ref> and 29 higher education institutions,<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://edu.gov.by/sistema-obrazovaniya/glavnoe-upravlenie-professionalnogo-obrazovaniya/vysshee-obrazovanie/|script-title=ru:\u0423\u043f\u0440\u0430\u0432\u043b\u0435\u043d\u0438\u0435 \u0432\u044b\u0441\u0448\u0435\u0433\u043e \u043e\u0431\u0440\u0430\u0437\u043e\u0432\u0430\u043d\u0438\u044f|trans-title=the management of higher education|language=ru|accessdate=23 July 2018|publisher=Ministry of education of the Republic of Belarus}}</ref> including 12 major national universities. {{citation needed|date=November 2011}}\n\n=== Major higher educational institutions ===\n\n*[[Academy of Public Administration (Belarus)|Academy of Public Administration under the aegis of the President of the Republic of Belarus]].

{"title_page": "Georges Chaulet", "text_new": "{{more citations needed|date=October 2016}}\n'''Georges Chaulet''' (25 January 1931 \u2013 13 October 2012) was a French writer most famous for the series ''[[Fant\u00f4mette]]'', a series he created in 1961. His books were destined for young readers and ''Fant\u00f4mette'' featured a female superhero for the first time in French literature. He is also the author of ''Les 4 As'', a series created in 1957. He also released ''Le Petit Lion'' children's book series.\n\n==Career==\nChaulet's father was an engineer, and his mother a shopkeeper. The family settled in 1936 in [[Antony, Hauts-de-Seine|Antony]] ([[Hauts-de-Seine]]), France. After his baccalaureate, Georges Chaulet continued studying architecture at [[\u00c9cole nationale sup\u00e9rieure des Beaux-Arts]]. From 1952 to 1954, he served in the French Army in Germany. Then he returned to Antony, where he worked in the family coffee business with his parents, at the same time starting to write as an author. He would stay in Antony most of the time.\n\nIn 1957, Georges Chaulet proposed his first series, ''Les 4 As'', to [[Hachette (publisher)|Hachette]], one of France biggest publishers. But Hachette refused to publish it, having just bought the rights to all of [[Enid Blyton]]'s novels, most notably ''[[The Famous Five (novel series)|The Famous Five]]''. Eventually [[Casterman]], another major French  publisher, published Chaulet's work. There were six books in the series, followed by 43 volumes as a comics series narrated by Chaulet and drawn by [[Fran\u00e7ois Craenhals]]. The series was the basis of the Belgian illustrated novel ''[[Les 4 As au coll\u00e8ge]]'' by Chaulet and Craenhals, first published in 1962. The novel was published by [[Casterman]] in the ''Relais'' series.\n\nStrengthened by the success of ''Les 4 As'', George Chaulet then proposed a new series titled ''[[Fant\u00f4mette]]'' to Hachette, and this time the publishing house accepted. Forty-nine volumes of ''Fant\u00f4mette'' were published from 1961 to 1987 in the ''Biblioth\u00e8que rose'' series. The Fantomette books were aimed at eight- to twelve-year-old girls. There are 52 books in the series. It also resulted in a comic book series by Fran\u00e7ois Craenhals, and a 1993 live-action TV series starring [[Katia Sourzac]] and a cartoon series in 1998. In 2006, to celebrate the 150 years of the \"Biblioth\u00e8que rose\", and after an eighteen-year absence, Georges Chaulet wrote a new adventure of his favorite hero\u00efne titled ''Le Retour de Fant\u00f4mette''.\n\nChaulet also authored ''Le Petit Lion'', a series of 13 children books inspired by the TV series of the same title. The books were published between 1968 and 1979 on Hachette in the collection series Biblioth\u00e8que rose.\n\nChaulet died on 13 October 2012, having written more than one hundred and fifty books for youth in the course of his career.\n\n==Publications==\n===''Les 4 As'' series===\n;Books\n#1957: ''Le Fant\u00f4me de Campaville'' \n#1958: ''Les 4 As font du cin\u00e9ma''\n#1959: ''Les 4 As et

Following the demise of his first wife, he marries Muthu Lakshmi Ammal so that the child from his marriage will not grow up without the love and care of a mother. Unknown to him, Muthu Lakshmi already has a son, who she called muthu.\n\nOn the night of the wedding, Muthu knocks at the door of Raja Rathnam Pillai, demanding that he be shown his mother. Once Raja Rathnam comes to know the truth, he takes Muthu into his care, giving him love, affection and a new name, \"Rajamanikyam\". Muthu returns the favour duly, as when Raja Rathnam's son ends up killing one of the children of the village, he takes the blame and leaves the village.\nSeveral years later, Raja Rathnam's two grown-up children, Rajaselvam ([[Manoj K. Jayan]]) and Rani Rathnam ([[Sindhu Menon]]), start fighting for their father's wealth. Rajaselvam, aided by his childhood buddy Simon Nadar ([[Ranjith (actor)|Ranjith]]) also notches up a plot to frame his own father in a murder case. As a result, Raja Rathnam is arrested, but dies of a heart attack while being taken to prison. After his death the two siblings call the family lawyer to read out Raja Rathnam's will in public. But to their surprise, they find that control of all the assets of their father have been given to a cattle dealer in [[Bellary]], known by the name of Bellary Raja ([[Mammootty]]), a billionaire. They fail to recognize that Bellary Raja is none other than Rajamanikyam. How Rajamanikyam returns to his home town to unite the warring siblings forms the rest of the story.\n\nDuring the course of the movie, Rajaselvam and Rani Rathnam tries to thwart Bellary Raja in order to regain control of their father's wealth. But Bellary Raja never falls for any of their attempts and he uses his secretary, educated Raju([[Rahman (actor)|Rahman]]) to stabilize the assets of his stepfather and prevents it from getting into the hands of his siblings, thereby preserving it. Raja effectively uses the help of his thug friends to restore order in the establishment. Simon and Rajaselvam send a goon to kill Bellary from his blind side. However Bellary thwart the attempt, causing him minor wound., Rajaselvam and Simon Nadar get into an argument. Simon Nadar, who wants to harm Rajaselvam, betrays him and he is held by one of his old trade partner, who demands a lot of money for the release of Rajaselvam. Rani, unknown to this, blame Rajamanikyam in order deny them their control on their father's wealth.  Rajamanikyam comes to his rescue, pays the required amount of money to release Rajaselvam. He emotionally reveals that he is none other than Rajaselvam's stepbrother and Rani's elder brother. Feeling regret to fulfill his father's wish to unite their family, He leave and prepare to go back. At night Rajaselvam, being drunk came to Bellary and apologize to him where both of them settle their old enmities. He ask Bellary not to leave them and reveal the truth behind their father's death. Towards the end of the movie, Rajaselvam and Simon Nadar get into an argument which turns into a fight. Selvam, beaten badly by Simon and his goons was about to be killed. However Bellary and his men came to rescue and fight off Simon.\n\nAt the Climax, Bellari releases a bull towards Simon for killing his father and trying to destroy his family and kills him. He reunited with Rajaselvam and takes him home. The movie ends when Rajamanikyam, who is half-blind, says, \"Now I have both eyes\", signifying Raju (whom he considers a brother) and Rajaselvam.\n\n== Cast ==\n{{colbegin}}\n* [[Mammootty]] as Rajamanikyam aka Bellary Raja(stepson of Raja Rathnam Pillai)\n* [[Rahman (actor)|Rahman]] as Raju\n* [[Manoj K.

Rani, unknown to this, blame Rajamanikyam in order deny them their control on their father's wealth.  Rajamanikyam comes to his rescue, pays the required amount of money to release Rajaselvam. He emotionally reveals that he is none other than Rajaselvam's stepbrother and Rani's elder brother. Feeling regret to fulfill his father's wish to unite their family, He leave and prepare to go back. At night Rajaselvam, being drunk came to Bellary and apologize to him where both of them settle their old enmities. He ask Bellary not to leave them and reveal the truth behind their father's death. Towards the end of the movie, Rajaselvam and Simon Nadar get into an argument which turns into a fight. Selvam, beaten badly by Simon and his goons was about to be killed. However Bellary and his men came to rescue and fight off Simon.\n\nAt the Climax, Bellari releases a bull towards Simon for killing his father and trying to destroy his family and kills him. He reunited with Rajaselvam and takes him home. The movie ends when Rajamanikyam, who is half-blind, says, \"Now I have both eyes\", signifying Raju (whom he considers a brother) and Rajaselvam.\n\n== Cast ==\n{{colbegin}}\n* [[Mammootty]] as Rajamanikyam aka Bellary Raja(stepson of Raja Rathnam Pillai)\n* [[Rahman (actor)|Rahman]] as Raju\n* [[Manoj K.

Although the Drinker model was effective and saved lives, its widespread use was hindered by the fact that the machines were very large, heavy (about 750 lbs), bulky, and expensive. In the US, an adult machine cost about $2000 in 1930, and \u00a32000 delivered to Melbourne in 1936. The cost in Europe in the mid-1950s was around \u00a31500.

Although the Drinker model was effective and saved lives, its widespread use was hindered by the fact that the machines were very large, heavy (about 750 lbs), bulky, and expensive. In the US, an adult machine cost about $2000 in 1930, and \u00a32000 delivered to Melbourne in 1936. The cost in Europe in the mid-1950s was around \u00a31500.
