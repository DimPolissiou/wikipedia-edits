Powerful and fearsome, he invaded the [[Dwarf (Middle-earth)|Dwarf]] kingdom of [[Erebor]] 150 years prior to the events described in the novel. A group of thirteen dwarves mounted a quest to take the kingdom back, aided by the [[Wizard (Middle-earth)|wizard]] [[Gandalf]] and the [[hobbit]] [[Bilbo Baggins]]. In ''The Hobbit'', [[Thorin Oakenshield|Thorin]] describes Smaug as \"a most specially greedy, strong and wicked [[Worm (dragon)|worm]]\".<ref group=T>{{harvnb|Tolkien|1937|loc=An Unexpected Party}}</ref>\n\nCritics have identified close parallels with what they presume are sources of Tolkien's inspiration, including the [[The dragon (Beowulf)|dragon in ''Beowulf'']], who is provoked by the stealing of a precious cup, and the speaking dragon [[Fafnir]], who proposes a betrayal.<ref name=\"Fafnir comparison\"/> A further source may be [[Henry Wadsworth Longfellow]]'s 1855 poem ''[[The Song of Hiawatha]]'', where Megissogwon, the spirit of wealth, is protected by an armoured shirt, but whose one weak spot is revealed by a talking bird.<ref name=\"Garth 2014\"/>\n\nSmaug was voiced and interpreted with [[performance capture]] by [[Benedict Cumberbatch]] in [[Peter Jackson]]'s [[The Hobbit (film series)|film adaptations of ''The Hobbit'']].\n\n== Story ==\n\n[[Dragon (Middle-earth)|Dragons]] lived in the [[Withered Heath]] beyond the [[Grey Mountains (Middle-earth)|Grey Mountains]]. Smaug was \"the greatest of the dragons of his day\", already centuries old at the time he was first recorded. He heard rumours of the great wealth of the [[Dwarf (Middle-earth)|Dwarf]]-kingdom of [[Erebor]], which had a prosperous trade with the Northmen of Dale. Smaug \"arose and without warning came against King Thr\u00f3r and descended on the mountain in flames\". After driving the Dwarves out of their stronghold, Smaug occupied the interior of the mountain for the next 150 years, guarding a vast hoard of treasure. He destroyed the town of Dale; the men retreated to the Long Lake, where they built [[Esgaroth|Lake-town]] of houses on stilts, surrounded by water to guard against the dragon.<ref group=T>{{harvnb|Tolkien|1955|loc=Appendix A:III \"Durin's Folk\"}}</ref>\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"width:400px\"; align=\"right\"\n|-\n|&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'The King under the Mountain is dead and where are his kin that dare seek revenge? Girion Lord of Dale is dead, and I have eaten his people like a wolf among sheep, and where are his sons' sons that dare approach me? I kill where I wish and none dare resist. I laid low the warriors of old and their like is not in the world today. Then I was but young and tender. Now I am old and strong, strong, strong, Thief in the Shadows!' he gloated. 'My armour is like tenfold shields, my teeth are swords, my claws spears, the shock of my tail a thunderbolt, my wings a hurricane, and my breath death!'\n\n\u2014J.R.R. Tolkien, ''The Hobbit''{{sfn|Tolkien|1937|loc=ch. 12 \"Inside Information\"}}\n|}\n\n[[Gandalf]] realized that Smaug could pose a serious threat if used by [[Sauron]]. He therefore agreed to assist a [[List of The Hobbit characters#Thorin's company|party of Dwarves]], led by Thr\u00f3r's grandson [[Thorin Oakenshield]], who set out to recapture the mountain and kill the dragon. Assuming that Smaug would not recognize the scent of a [[hobbit]], Gandalf recruited the [[hobbit]] [[Bilbo Baggins]] to join the quest.<ref group=T>{{harvnb|Tolkien|1980|loc=The Quest of Erebor}}</ref>\n\nUpon reaching Erebor, the Dwarves sent Bilbo into Smaug's lair, and he was initially successful in stealing a beautiful golden cup as Smaug slept fitfully. Knowing the contents of the treasure hoard which he had slept upon for centuries to the ounce, Smaug quickly realized the cup's absence upon his awakening and searched for the thief on the Mountain. Unsuccessful, he returned to his hoard to lie in wait. Having been nearly killed in the dragon's search, the Dwarves sent Bilbo down the secret tunnel a second time. Smaug sensed Bilbo's presence immediately, even though Bilbo had rendered himself invisible with the [[One Ring]], and accused the Hobbit (correctly) of trying to steal from him. During his discourse with the dragon, Bilbo noticed a small bare patch on Smaug's jewel-encrusted underbelly, and narrowly escaped. A thrush overheard Bilbo's account of the meeting, and learnt of the bare patch on Smaug's underside.<ref name=\"Inside Information\" group=T>{{harvnb|Tolkien|1937|loc=Inside Information}}</ref>\n\nStill enraged, Smaug flew south to Laketown and set about destroying it. The townsmen's arrows and spears proved useless against the dragon's armoured body. The thrush told [[Bard the Bowman]] of Smaug's one weak spot, a bare patch on the dragon's belly. With his last arrow, Bard killed Smaug by shooting into this place.<ref group=T>{{harvnb|Tolkien|1937|loc=Fire and Water}}</ref>\n\n==Concept and creation==\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"width:400px\"; align=\"right\"\n|-\n|The dragon stopped short in his boasting.

'Truly there can nowhere be found the equal of Lord Smaug the Impenetrable. What magnificence to possess a waistcoat of fine diamonds!'\n\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'Yes, it is rare and wonderful, indeed', said Smaug absurdly pleased. He did not know that the hobbit had already caught a glimpse of his peculiar under-covering on his previous visit, and was itching for a closer view for reasons of his own. The dragon rolled over. 'Look!' he said. 'What do you say to that?'\n\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'Dazzlingly marvellous! Perfect! Flawless! Staggering!' exclaimed Bilbo aloud, but what he thought inside was: 'Old fool!

Smaug was \"the greatest of the dragons of his day\", already centuries old at the time he was first recorded. He heard rumours of the great wealth of the [[Dwarf (Middle-earth)|Dwarf]]-kingdom of [[Erebor]], which had a prosperous trade with the Northmen of Dale. Smaug \"arose and without warning came against King Thr\u00f3r and descended on the mountain in flames\". After driving the Dwarves out of their stronghold, Smaug occupied the interior of the mountain for the next 150 years, guarding a vast hoard of treasure. He destroyed the town of Dale; the men retreated to the Long Lake, where they built [[Esgaroth|Lake-town]] of houses on stilts, surrounded by water to guard against the dragon.<ref group=T>{{harvnb|Tolkien|1955|loc=Appendix A:III \"Durin's Folk\"}}</ref>\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"width:400px\"; align=\"right\"\n|-\n|&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'The King under the Mountain is dead and where are his kin that dare seek revenge? Girion Lord of Dale is dead, and I have eaten his people like a wolf among sheep, and where are his sons' sons that dare approach me? I kill where I wish and none dare resist. I laid low the warriors of old and their like is not in the world today. Then I was but young and tender. Now I am old and strong, strong, strong, Thief in the Shadows!' he gloated. 'My armour is like tenfold shields, my teeth are swords, my claws spears, the shock of my tail a thunderbolt, my wings a hurricane, and my breath death!'\n\n\u2014J.R.R. Tolkien, ''The Hobbit''{{sfn|Tolkien|1937|loc=ch. 12 \"Inside Information\"}}\n|}\n\n[[Gandalf]] realized that Smaug could pose a serious threat if used by [[Sauron]]. He therefore agreed to assist a [[List of The Hobbit characters#Thorin's company|party of Dwarves]], led by Thr\u00f3r's grandson [[Thorin Oakenshield]], who set out to recapture the mountain and kill the dragon. Assuming that Smaug would not recognize the scent of a [[hobbit]], Gandalf recruited the [[hobbit]] [[Bilbo Baggins]] to join the quest.<ref group=T>{{harvnb|Tolkien|1980|loc=The Quest of Erebor}}</ref>\n\nUpon reaching Erebor, the Dwarves sent Bilbo into Smaug's lair, and he was initially successful in stealing a beautiful golden cup as Smaug slept fitfully. Knowing the contents of the treasure hoard which he had slept upon for centuries to the ounce, Smaug quickly realized the cup's absence upon his awakening and searched for the thief on the Mountain. Unsuccessful, he returned to his hoard to lie in wait. Having been nearly killed in the dragon's search, the Dwarves sent Bilbo down the secret tunnel a second time. Smaug sensed Bilbo's presence immediately, even though Bilbo had rendered himself invisible with the [[One Ring]], and accused the Hobbit (correctly) of trying to steal from him. During his discourse with the dragon, Bilbo noticed a small bare patch on Smaug's jewel-encrusted underbelly, and narrowly escaped. A thrush overheard Bilbo's account of the meeting, and learnt of the bare patch on Smaug's underside.<ref name=\"Inside Information\" group=T>{{harvnb|Tolkien|1937|loc=Inside Information}}</ref>\n\nStill enraged, Smaug flew south to Laketown and set about destroying it. The townsmen's arrows and spears proved useless against the dragon's armoured body. The thrush told [[Bard the Bowman]] of Smaug's one weak spot, a bare patch on the dragon's belly.

'Truly there can nowhere be found the equal of Lord Smaug the Impenetrable. What magnificence to possess a waistcoat of fine diamonds!'\n\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'Yes, it is rare and wonderful, indeed', said Smaug absurdly pleased. He did not know that the hobbit had already caught a glimpse of his peculiar under-covering on his previous visit, and was itching for a closer view for reasons of his own. The dragon rolled over. 'Look!' he said. 'What do you say to that?'\n\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'Dazzlingly marvellous! Perfect! Flawless! Staggering!' exclaimed Bilbo aloud, but what he thought inside was: 'Old fool!

It was the first major conflict between the two powers since 440, and would be the prelude to a long [[Byzantine-Sassanid Wars|series of destructive conflicts]] between the two empires over the next century.\n\n==Prelude==\nSeveral factors underlay the termination of the longest period of peace the [[Byzantine Empire|Eastern Roman]] and the [[Sassanid Empire]] ever enjoyed. The Persian king [[Kavadh I]] needed money to pay his debts to the [[Hephthalites]] who had helped him regain his throne in 498/499. The situation was exacerbated by recent changes in the flow of the [[Tigris]] in [[Lower Mesopotamia]], sparking famines and flood. When the Roman emperor [[Anastasius I (emperor)|Anastasius I]] refused to provide any help, Kavadh tried to gain the money by force.<ref>Procopius.

The army was the largest Roman force in the East since [[Julian's Persian War|Julian's invasion of Persia]]. The force gathered at [[Edessa]] and [[Samosata]]. It operated in three divisions under ''[[magister militum per Orientem]]'' [[Areobindus Dagalaiphus Areobindus|Areobindus]], ''[[strategos]]'' [[Patricius (consul 500)|Patricius]], and [[Hypatius (consul 500)|Hypatius]].

According to Zacharias, their cavalry suffered heavily during the retreat, falling from the cliffs of mountains. Kavadh continued westward to [[Constantia (Osrhoene)|Constantia]] but failed to capture it, though received supplies from its inhabitants. In early September, Kacadh reached near Edessa. Areobindus rejected Kavadh I's demand of {{convert|10,000|lb}} of gold in exchange for peace. Sasanians and [[Lakhmids]]s overran much of Osrhoene but attempts to attack the fortified city failed. Meanwhile, Byzantine forces under [[Pharesmanes]] attacked Amida, who killed the Sasanian commander [[Glones]] through cunning. This, together with Hunnic incursions, the arrival of Byzantine reinforcements, and Kavadh I's lack of supplies, all forced him to withdraw to Persia.

Patricius moved to Amida, defeated a force sent against him, and invested the city; Celer joined him later in the spring of 504. While the siege was ongoing, Celer raided [[Beth Arabaye]], while Areobindus raided [[Arzanene]]. Sasanian weakness at this point is apparent by defections to the Byzantine side by the renegade Constantine, a certain Arab chief Adid, and the Armenian Mushlek. The Byzantines eventually captured Amida.<ref name=\"Greatrex-Lieu (2002), 77\" /><ref name=\"Dodgeon\" />\n\n===Peace treaty===\n\nIn the same year, an armistice was agreed as a result of an invasion of Armenia by the [[Hun]]s from the Caucasus. Negotiations between the two powers took place, but such was the distrust that in 506 the Romans, suspecting treachery, seized the Persian officials; once released, the Persians preferred to stay in [[Nisibis]].<ref name=\"Greatrex-Lieu (2002), 77\">{{harvnb|Greatrex|Lieu|2002|p=77}}.</ref> In November 506, a treaty was finally agreed, but little is known of what the terms of the treaty were.

The dilapidated fortifications were also upgraded at Edessa, [[Batnae]] and Amida.<ref>{{harvnb|Greatrex|Lieu|2002|p=74}}.</ref>\n\nAlthough no further large-scale conflict took place during Anastasius's reign, tensions continued, especially while work continued at Dara. This construction project was to become a key component of the Roman defenses, and also a lasting source of controversy with the Persians, who complained that its construction violated the treaty agreed in 422, by which both empires had agreed not to establish new fortifications in the frontier zone. Anastasius, however, pursued the project, deflecting Kavadh's complaints with money.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://archive.org/details/belisariuslastro00ianh|title=Belisarius : the last Roman general|last=Hughes, Ian (Historian)|date=2009|publisher=Westholme|isbn=9781594160851|location=Yardley, Pa.|oclc=294885267|url-access=registration}}</ref> The Persians were in any case unable to stop the work, and the walls were completed by 507/508.<ref name=\"Greatrex-Lieu (2002), 77\"/>\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|2}}\n\n==Sources==\n\n===Primary===\n{{refbegin}}\n*{{cite book|last1=Procopius|last2=Dewing|first2=H.

It was the first major conflict between the two powers since 440, and would be the prelude to a long [[Byzantine-Sassanid Wars|series of destructive conflicts]] between the two empires over the next century.\n\n==Prelude==\nSeveral factors underlay the termination of the longest period of peace the [[Byzantine Empire|Eastern Roman]] and the [[Sassanid Empire]] ever enjoyed. The Persian king [[Kavadh I]] needed money to pay his debts to the [[Hephthalites]] who had helped him regain his throne in 498/499. The situation was exacerbated by recent changes in the flow of the [[Tigris]] in [[Lower Mesopotamia]], sparking famines and flood. When the Roman emperor [[Anastasius I (emperor)|Anastasius I]] refused to provide any help, Kavadh tried to gain the money by force.<ref>Procopius.

The army was the largest Roman force in the East since [[Julian's Persian War|Julian's invasion of Persia]]. The force gathered at [[Edessa]] and [[Samosata]]. It operated in three divisions under ''[[magister militum per Orientem]]'' [[Areobindus Dagalaiphus Areobindus|Areobindus]], ''[[strategos]]'' [[Patricius (consul 500)|Patricius]], and [[Hypatius (consul 500)|Hypatius]]. Hypatius and Patricius attacked Amida, which was held by a 3,000-strong garrison under [[Glones]]. Areobindus, together with [[Romanus (dux)|Romanus]] and thee Arab ''[[phylarch]]'' Asouades (Aswad) (probably a [[Kindah]] leader) attacked [[Nisibis]], in which Kavadh I was residing.<ref name=\"Heather\">{{cite book |last1=Heather |first1=Peter J. |title=Rome Resurgent: War and Empire in the Age of Justinian |date=2018 |publisher=Oxford University Press |isbn=978-0-19-936274-5 |page=77 |language=en}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |last1=Shahid |first1=Irfan |title=Byzantium and the Arabs in the Sixth Century |date=1995 |publisher=Dumbarton Oaks |isbn=978-0-88402-214-5 |page=21 |language=en}}</ref> Procopius also mentions [[Celer (magister officiorum)|Celer]] as a fourth commander.<ref name=\"Procopius62\" /> Notable officers associated with this force include ''\"[[hyparch]]\"'' [[Apion (family)|Apion I]] (the Egyptian),<ref>{{cite book |last1=Bury |first1=John Bagnell |title=History of the Later Roman Empire from the Death of Theodosius I. to the Death of Justinian |date=1958 |publisher=Courier Corporation |isbn=978-0-486-20398-0 |page=471 |language=en}}</ref> ''[[comes]]'' [[Justin I|Justin]] (the future emperor),<ref name=\"Dodgeon\" />  [[Patriciolus]] and his son [[Vitalian (general)|Vitalian]] (who later revolted against Anastasius), the Colchian [[Pharesmanes]], and the Goths Godidisklus and [[Bessas (general)|Bessas]].<ref name=\"Procopius62\">{{cite book |author1=Procopius of Caesarea |authorlink1=Procopius of Caesarea |title=History of the Wars: Books 1-2 (Persian War) |date=2007 |publisher=Cosimo, Inc. |isbn=978-1-60206-445-4 |pages=62-63 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=toHxDMLTJ4MC&lpg=PA63&pg=PA63 |language=en}}</ref>\n\nInitially, Areobindus gained the upper hand in Nisibis, but Kavadh I's counterattack defeated him, plundered his fort Apadna, and forced him to retreat westward; Hypatius and Patricius attempted to assist him, but it was too late.<ref name=\"Heather\" /> They failed to join with Areobindus and were decisively defeated between Apadna and [[Tell Beshme]] and retreated to Samosata. According to Zacharias, their cavalry suffered heavily during the retreat, falling from the cliffs of mountains. Kavadh continued westward to [[Constantia (Osrhoene)|Constantia]] but failed to capture it, though received supplies from its inhabitants. In early September, Kacadh reached near Edessa. Areobindus rejected Kavadh I's demand of {{convert|10,000|lb}} of gold in exchange for peace. Sasanians and [[Lakhmids]]s overran much of Osrhoene but attempts to attack the fortified city failed. Meanwhile, Byzantine forces under [[Pharesmanes]] attacked Amida, who killed the Sasanian commander [[Glones]] through cunning. This, together with Hunnic incursions, the arrival of Byzantine reinforcements, and Kavadh I's lack of supplies, all forced him to withdraw to Persia. This further contributed to the reputation of Edessa as being impregnable.<ref name=\"Dodgeon\">{{cite book |last1=Dodgeon |first1=Michael H. |last2=Lieu |first2=Samuel N.

Patricius moved to Amida, defeated a force sent against him, and invested the city; Celer joined him later in the spring of 504. While the siege was ongoing, Celer raided [[Beth Arabaye]], while Areobindus raided [[Arzanene]]. Sasanian weakness at this point is apparent by defections to the Byzantine side by the renegade Constantine, a certain Arab chief Adid, and the Armenian Mushlek. The Byzantines eventually captured Amida.<ref name=\"Greatrex-Lieu (2002), 77\" /><ref name=\"Dodgeon\" />\n\n===Peace treaty===\n\nIn the same year, an armistice was agreed as a result of an invasion of Armenia by the [[Hun]]s from the Caucasus. Negotiations between the two powers took place, but such was the distrust that in 506 the Romans, suspecting treachery, seized the Persian officials; once released, the Persians preferred to stay in [[Nisibis]].<ref name=\"Greatrex-Lieu (2002), 77\">{{harvnb|Greatrex|Lieu|2002|p=77}}.</ref> In November 506, a treaty was finally agreed, but little is known of what the terms of the treaty were.

The dilapidated fortifications were also upgraded at Edessa, [[Batnae]] and Amida.<ref>{{harvnb|Greatrex|Lieu|2002|p=74}}.</ref>\n\nAlthough no further large-scale conflict took place during Anastasius's reign, tensions continued, especially while work continued at Dara. This construction project was to become a key component of the Roman defenses, and also a lasting source of controversy with the Persians, who complained that its construction violated the treaty agreed in 422, by which both empires had agreed not to establish new fortifications in the frontier zone. Anastasius, however, pursued the project, deflecting Kavadh's complaints with money.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://archive.org/details/belisariuslastro00ianh|title=Belisarius : the last Roman general|last=Hughes, Ian (Historian)|date=2009|publisher=Westholme|isbn=9781594160851|location=Yardley, Pa.|oclc=294885267|url-access=registration}}</ref> The Persians were in any case unable to stop the work, and the walls were completed by 507/508.<ref name=\"Greatrex-Lieu (2002), 77\"/>\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|2}}\n\n==Sources==\n\n===Primary===\n{{refbegin}}\n*{{cite book|last1=Procopius|last2=Dewing|first2=H.

Exceptions include the [[Hilliard Ensemble]]'s second set,<ref name=\"Guardian\">{{Cite news |last=Clements |first=Andrew |url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/2007/may/18/classicalmusicandopera.shopping2 |title=Bach: Motets |date=18 May 2007 |work=The Guardian}}</ref> and [[Konrad Jungh\u00e4nel]] with the group Cantus C\u00f6lln.<ref name=\"Bach Cantatas6\">{{Cite web |url=http://www.bach-cantatas.com/Vocal/BWV225-231-Rec6.htm |title= Motets / Recordings \u2013 Part 6 |website=Bach Cantatas Website}}</ref>\n\nAt least some of the motets would have been first performed by singers from Leipzig's [[Thomanerchor]], which comprises boys and young men. This choir has recorded the motets (initially under [[G\u00fcnther Ramin]] in the 1950s),<ref name=\"Bach Cantatas2\">{{Cite web |url=http://www.bach-cantatas.com/Vocal/BWV225-231-Rec2.htm  |title= Motets / Recordings \u2013 Part 2 |website=Bach Cantatas Website}}</ref> as have other choirs with boys' voices such as the [[Choir of New College, Oxford]].<ref name=\"BachCantatas7\"/>\n\n== Instrumental accompaniment ==\nMusic directors need to make choices about the instrumental accompaniment, if any, to be used. There are three possible approaches: \n*instruments doubling the vocal lines, something which is described as playing ''[[colla parte]]'' \n*''[[a cappella]]'', that is, without an accompaniment: a tradition of performing the motets \n*Some support for the singers from instruments such as an [[Organ (music)|organ]]\n\nSurviving sources do not make it clear what Bach's approach was to the accompaniment of most of these pieces. In the case of [[Der Geist hilft unser Schwachheit auf, BWV 226|''Der Geist hilft unser Schwachheit auf'', BWV 226]] orchestral parts are extant, indicating that choir I was doubled by strings and choir II by reeds (two [[oboe]]s, [[Taille (instrument)|taille]] and [[bassoon]]). There is also a [[basso continuo]] (separate [[violone]] and organ parts are provided) which underlies both choirs.<ref name=\"bachchoir\">{{Cite web |url=https://bach.org/education/motet-bwv-226/ |title=Motet BWV 226 |website=Bach Choir of Bethlehem |access-date=2020-04-10}}</ref>\nAn accompaniment is also specified for ''Lobet den Herrn''.<ref name=\"Leavis\">{{cite web | url= https://www.jstor.org/stable/731829| title=Bach's Setting of Psalm CXVII (BWV.230) | publisher=OUP | work=[[Music & Letters]].

Claims that Peter van Oossanen was the designer of the ''Australia II'''s keel instead of by Ben have been strongly rejected by [[John Bertrand (Australian sailor)|John Bertrand]] and by John Longley, a key member of the ''Australia II'' team using documentary evidence.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://archive.sailingscuttlebutt.com/news/09/1019/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-05-09 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131026060758/http://archive.sailingscuttlebutt.com/news/09/1019/ |archivedate=26 October 2013 |df=dmy-all }}></ref>\n\nThe [[1983 America's Cup]] saw Lexcen's ''[[Australia II]]'', with [[John Bertrand (Australian sailor)|John Bertrand]] at the helm, take on the NYYC skipper [[Dennis Conner]] and the defender yacht, [[Liberty (yacht)|''Liberty'']]. The Australians were sure they had a fast boat. Australia II had dominated the challenger eliminations just as Liberty had dominated the closer defender trials, honing her tuning and performance. But mechanical failures on Australia II and skillful sailing by the defenders caused ''Australia II'' to fall behind, losing the first two races. ''Australia II'' stormed back to take three of the next four. Dennis Conner had creatively registered three different configurations (sail area, spar length and ballast) for Liberty and he successfully called for lay days to choose advantageous weather to suit his most competitive versions of the boat. This was the first time in history that the series depended on the result of the last race, and the pressure of defending the Cup was now firmly on Liberty. In the deciding race on 26 September, Conner prepared Liberty in her very competitive light weather configuration with big sail area and low weight. Australia II won the start and held an early lead but was overtaken by Liberty which built up a substantial margin.  At the start of the penultimate leg (a square run) the breeze was very light and Liberty was vulnerable.  Liberty chose a starboard tack leg and declined to cover Australia II which allowed them to run deeper and faster assisted by breeze and windshifts allowing Australia II to overtake the Americans by the leeward mark.  Liberty then engaged Australia in a spectacular tacking duel with nearly 50 tacks and a number of faked \"dummy\" tacks trying to break the Australians' cover.   Australia II held on till both boats reached the starboard layline in amongst the spectator fleet and tacked several boat lengths ahead of Liberty and sailed to the finish to take the race.  Australia II became the first challenger to wrest the Cup from the United States since its inception in 1870. Lexcen was made a Member of the [[Order of Australia]] for his contributions to the winning design.\n\nLexcen was commissioned by Bond once again in 1986 to design a defender for the [[1987 America's Cup]].  He designed ''Australia III'' and ''[[Australia IV]]'' for Bond's two boat defense program.  ''[[Australia IV]]'' was ultimately defeated by the [[Iain Murray (yachtsman)|Iain Murray]] designed and skippered ''[[Kookaburra III]]'' in the [[1987 Defender Selection Series|Defender Trials]]. Steve Ward (builder of all four \"Australias\" maintains that Lexen's design was not at fault but that ''[[Australia IV]]'' was uncompetitive due to last minute design modifications ordered by the upper echelons of Bond Corporation.  ''[[Australia IV]]'' was originally designed to be longer on the waterline with less sail area similar to Conner's winning design.  Australia competed in the Cup without a Lexcen designed boat for the first time in ten years. ''Kookaburra III'' lost in the finals to Dennis Conner and his American challenger, ''[[Stars & Stripes 87]]'', 4 races to nil.<ref name=classic12metercharters>{{cite web|url=http://www.classic12metercharters.com/history.asp|title=The 12-Metre Class America's Cup Contenders 1958\u20131987 |accessdate=2008-02-23|work=Sail World}}</ref>\n\n==Death==\nLexcen died suddenly in [[Manly, New South Wales]] on 1 May 1988, of a [[myocardial infarction|heart attack]] at 52 years of age.

The ruling arrived at on the boat confirmed that ''Australia II'' complied with both the [[12-metre class]] and the [[America's Cup]] rules. The questions on her design origin were not formally answered at the time, {{citation needed|date=May 2013}} but the controversy re-emerged in 2009 (see [[Australia II#Later claims of Dutch design|Later claims of Dutch Design]] for details). Claims that Peter van Oossanen was the designer of the ''Australia II'''s keel instead of by Ben have been strongly rejected by [[John Bertrand (Australian sailor)|John Bertrand]] and by John Longley, a key member of the ''Australia II'' team using documentary evidence.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://archive.sailingscuttlebutt.com/news/09/1019/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-05-09 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131026060758/http://archive.sailingscuttlebutt.com/news/09/1019/ |archivedate=26 October 2013 |df=dmy-all }}></ref>\n\nThe [[1983 America's Cup]] saw Lexcen's ''[[Australia II]]'', with [[John Bertrand (Australian sailor)|John Bertrand]] at the helm, take on the NYYC skipper [[Dennis Conner]] and the defender yacht, [[Liberty (yacht)|''Liberty'']]. The Australians were sure they had a fast boat. Australia II had dominated the challenger eliminations just as Liberty had dominated the closer defender trials, honing her tuning and performance. But mechanical failures on Australia II and skillful sailing by the defenders caused ''Australia II'' to fall behind, losing the first two races. ''Australia II'' stormed back to take three of the next four. Dennis Conner had creatively registered three different configurations (sail area, spar length and ballast) for Liberty and he successfully called for lay days to choose advantageous weather to suit his most competitive versions of the boat. This was the first time in history that the series depended on the result of the last race, and the pressure of defending the Cup was now firmly on Liberty. In the deciding race on 26 September, Conner prepared Liberty in her very competitive light weather configuration with big sail area and low weight. Australia II won the start and held an early lead but was overtaken by Liberty which built up a substantial margin.  At the start of the penultimate leg (a square run) the breeze was very light and Liberty was vulnerable.  Liberty chose a starboard tack leg and declined to cover Australia II which allowed them to run deeper and faster assisted by breeze and windshifts allowing Australia II to overtake the Americans by the leeward mark.  Liberty then engaged Australia in a spectacular tacking duel with nearly 50 tacks and a number of faked \"dummy\" tacks trying to break the Australians' cover.   Australia II held on till both boats reached the starboard layline in amongst the spectator fleet and tacked several boat lengths ahead of Liberty and sailed to the finish to take the race.  Australia II became the first challenger to wrest the Cup from the United States since its inception in 1870. Lexcen was made a Member of the [[Order of Australia]] for his contributions to the winning design.\n\nLexcen was commissioned by Bond once again in 1986 to design a defender for the [[1987 America's Cup]].  He designed ''Australia III'' and ''[[Australia IV]]'' for Bond's two boat defense program.  ''[[Australia IV]]'' was ultimately defeated by the [[Iain Murray (yachtsman)|Iain Murray]] designed and skippered ''[[Kookaburra III]]'' in the [[1987 Defender Selection Series|Defender Trials]]. Steve Ward (builder of all four \"Australias\" maintains that Lexen's design was not at fault but that ''[[Australia IV]]'' was uncompetitive due to last minute design modifications ordered by the upper echelons of Bond Corporation.  ''[[Australia IV]]'' was originally designed to be longer on the waterline with less sail area similar to Conner's winning design.  Australia competed in the Cup without a Lexcen designed boat for the first time in ten years. ''Kookaburra III'' lost in the finals to Dennis Conner and his American challenger, ''[[Stars & Stripes 87]]'', 4 races to nil.<ref name=classic12metercharters>{{cite web|url=http://www.classic12metercharters.com/history.asp|title=The 12-Metre Class America's Cup Contenders 1958\u20131987 |accessdate=2008-02-23|work=Sail World}}</ref>\n\n==Death==\nLexcen died suddenly in [[Manly, New South Wales]] on 1 May 1988, of a [[myocardial infarction|heart attack]] at 52 years of age.
