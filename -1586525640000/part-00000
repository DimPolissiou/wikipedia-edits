If the trace is intact, memory can be restored promptly and accurately. The node for correct recall is reached, and the recall process is terminated.

It was written by Lipa and its producers [[Emile Haynie]] and [[Andrew Wyatt]] about the singer's struggle to find her place in the music industry. The song is a [[Soul music|soul]]-tinged, [[synth-pop]] ballad with [[Contemporary R&B|R&B]] inflections and a stomping, tribal [[drum beat]] throughout.\n\nDespite receiving limited attention upon its [[Independent record label|independent release]] on 21 August 2015, \"New Love\" became popular among music tastemakers and helped Lipa receive a longlisting in [[BBC]]'s [[Sound of...]] critics poll for 2016. Photographer Nicole Nodland directed the music video which is a montage of filtered footage of Lipa in Los Angeles doing activities she enjoys.

In the US, they take place in a funeral home during or after a [[Wake (ceremony)|wake]]; in the UK they are said during the service, typically at a crematorium or place of worship, before the wake.

His grandfather was a poor scholar from [[County Tyrone]] and made his way down to Tara to take part in the [[1798 Rising]].<ref name=mc>http://www.meathchronicle.ie/news/1916centenary/articles/2016/05/06/4119365-the-1916-series-kilskyre-remembers-brian-ohiggins/</ref> He was educated at the Kilskyre National School for ten years from 1886 before becoming a draper's apprentice at nearby Clonmellon. He was also in this period contribute articles for local newspapers. He moved to Dublin in 1901 as a teenager to work as a barman and during his time there he joined the O'Growney Branch of the [[Conradh na Gaeilge|Gaelic League]] and Saint Finians Hurling Club.<ref name=nhs>http://www.navanhistory.ie/index.php?page=brian-o-higgins</ref> His health declined in 1903 and he returned to live in his native Meath. It was during his recuperation at home that he co-founded the local hurling club, whose grounds were later named in his memory (P\u00e1irc U\u00ed hUig\u00edn).\n\nO'Higgins was present at the first annual convention of the National Council of Sinn F\u00e9in on 28 November 1905, and wrote its first party anthem entitled 'Sinn F\u00e9in Amh\u00e1in'. The song was sung at all gatherings of the organisation for a number of years.\n\nAfter attending an Irish-language summer college at Ballingeary, Co. Cork, O'Higgins received a language teacher's certificate in 1906 and began work as a m\u00fainteoir taistil (travelling teacher) for the Gaelic League. During this time he founded Col\u00e1iste U\u00ed Chomhraidhe, an Irish language college in Carrigaholt, [[County Clare]].<ref>http://www.clarelibrary.ie/eolas/coclare/songs/cmc/a_stor_mo_chroi_oconway.htm</ref> He became a good friend of [[Patrick Pearse|P\u00e1draig Pearse]], after they first met in 1906.\n\nBrian na Banban first published his poetry in book form in 1907 as The Voice of Banba: Songs and Recitations for Young Ireland. Some of O'Higgins' work is anodyne and sentimental stuff, as per his Christmas Stories and Sketches (1917), Hearts of Gold (1918) and Songs of the Sacred Heart (1921). These works were commended by the Bishop of Killaloe, the Sinn F\u00e9in-supporting Michael Fogarty, as being 'full of simple and profound religious feeling'.\n\nO'Higgins' poem \"[[:wikisource:Who is Ireland's Enemy?|Who is Ireland's Enemy?]]\", was first published in September 1914 in  ''[[Irish Freedom]]'', in an edition entitled ''Germany Is Not Ireland's Enemy''; it became popular during the [[1918 Irish conscription crisis]]. According to Christopher M. Kennedy,  the poem was \"perhaps the most blatant example of using past wrongs committed by England to keep the old hatreds alive\".<ref>{{cite book |title=Genesis of the Rising, 1912\u20131916: A Transformation of Nationalist Opinion|last=Kennedy|first=Christopher M.|year=2010|publisher=Peter Lang|isbn=1433105004|ref=harv|p=99}}</ref>\n\n==Republican activity==\n\nO'Higgins was a founding member of the [[Irish Volunteers]] in 1913, which organised to work for Irish independence. On Easter Monday of 1916 he was in a group of Volunteers who were held at 41 Parnell Square as reserves, on account of their age, health or physical condition. This group was called to the GPO at six o'clock that evening. He was put on guard duty at the main entrance to the GPO and he later served under Quartermaster Michael Staines. He assisted in the evacuation of the wounded from the GPO on Friday evening and spent the night in a shed off Moore Street. He was deported to [[Stafford Gaol]] on May 1 and interned in [[Frongoch internment camp]] until February 1917.<ref name=nhs/>\n\nIn May 1918 he was arrested and deported to Birmingham Jail, and was elected Sinn F\u00e9in candidate for West Clare during the 1918 General Election.<ref name=oireachtas_db>{{cite web|url=https://www.oireachtas.ie/en/members/member/Brian-O'Higgins.D.1919-01-21/|title=Brian O'Higgins|work=Oireachtas Members Database|access-date=11 April 2009}}</ref>\n\nIn January 1919, Sinn F\u00e9in MPs who had been elected in the Westminster elections of 1918 refused to recognise the [[Parliament of the United Kingdom]] and instead assembled in [[Dublin]] as a revolutionary parliament called [[D\u00e1il \u00c9ireann (Irish Republic)|D\u00e1il \u00c9ireann]].

At this meeting, the seven signed over what they believed was the authority of the Government of D\u00e1il \u00c9ireann to the Army Council. Henceforth, the IRA Army Council perceived itself to be the legitimate government of the [[Irish Republic]] and, on this basis, the IRA and Sinn F\u00e9in justified their rejection of the states of the [[Republic of Ireland]] and [[Northern Ireland]] and political [[abstentionism]] from their parliamentary institutions.\n\nToday, the dissident terrorist organisation [[Continuity Irish Republican Army|Continuity IRA]] claim to be the heirs of this legitimacy and believe to be the legitimate continuation of the original [[Irish Republican Army (1917\u201322)|Irish Republican Army]] or ''\u00d3glaigh na h\u00c9ireann''.<ref>{{cite book | last = van Engeland | first = Anisseh | authorlink = | title = From Terrorism to Politics (Ethics and Global Politics) | publisher = [[Ashgate Publishing]] | year = 2008 | page = 55 | doi =  | isbn = 978-0-7546-4990-8}}</ref>\n\n==Later life==\n\nFrom the late 1920s he ran a successful business publishing greeting cards, calendars and devotional materials decorated with Celtic designs and O'Higgins' own verses.\n\nFollowing the suppression of [[An Phoblacht]] in 1937, he founded and edited the [[Wolfe Tone Weekly]] from 1937\u20131939 until it was also banned by the Free State Government. From 1932 to 1962 he published the [[Wolfe Tone Annual]], from his business at 56 Parnell Square, Dublin. This popular series of volumes gave popular accounts of episodes in Irish history from a republican viewpoint and he intended to cheer and inspire those true to 'the Separatist Idea and devoted to the vindication of all those who have sacrificed themselves for the full Independence and Gaelicisation of Ireland'. O'higgins edited all the issues, and contributed much of the articles himself. \n\nHe was a devout Catholic and was heavily critical of those who tried to link the Republican struggle with socialism and communism. Several of his children became Catholic priests.\n\n==Death==\n\nO'Higgins died while praying in Saint Anthony's Church in Clontarf, on 10 March 1963 <ref name=brianofbanbha>{{cite web |url=https://brianofbanba.wordpress.com/2018/05/10/brian-ohiggins-an-uncompromising-patriot/ |language=English |title=Brian O\u2019Higgins \u2013 An Uncompromising Patriot |work=brianofbanba.wordpress.com}}</ref>.

His grandfather was a poor scholar from [[County Tyrone]] and made his way down to Tara to take part in the [[1798 Rising]].<ref name=mc>http://www.meathchronicle.ie/news/1916centenary/articles/2016/05/06/4119365-the-1916-series-kilskyre-remembers-brian-ohiggins/</ref> He was educated at the Kilskyre National School for ten years from 1886 before becoming a draper's apprentice at nearby Clonmellon. He was also in this period contribute articles for local newspapers. He moved to Dublin in 1901 as a teenager to work as a barman and during his time there he joined the O'Growney Branch of the [[Conradh na Gaeilge|Gaelic League]] and Saint Finians Hurling Club.<ref name=nhs>http://www.navanhistory.ie/index.php?page=brian-o-higgins</ref> His health declined in 1903 and he returned to live in his native Meath. It was during his recuperation at home that he co-founded the local hurling club, whose grounds were later named in his memory (P\u00e1irc U\u00ed hUig\u00edn).\n\nO'Higgins was present at the first annual convention of the National Council of Sinn F\u00e9in on 28 November 1905, and wrote its first party anthem entitled 'Sinn F\u00e9in Amh\u00e1in'. The song was sung at all gatherings of the organisation for a number of years.\n\nAfter attending an Irish-language summer college at Ballingeary, Co. Cork, O'Higgins received a language teacher's certificate in 1906 and began work as a m\u00fainteoir taistil (travelling teacher) for the Gaelic League. During this time he founded Col\u00e1iste U\u00ed Chomhraidhe, an Irish language college in Carrigaholt, [[County Clare]].<ref>http://www.clarelibrary.ie/eolas/coclare/songs/cmc/a_stor_mo_chroi_oconway.htm</ref> He became a good friend of [[Patrick Pearse|P\u00e1draig Pearse]], after they first met in 1906.\n\nBrian na Banban first published his poetry in book form in 1907 as The Voice of Banba: Songs and Recitations for Young Ireland. Some of O'Higgins' work is anodyne and sentimental stuff, as per his Christmas Stories and Sketches (1917), Hearts of Gold (1918) and Songs of the Sacred Heart (1921). These works were commended by the Bishop of Killaloe, the Sinn F\u00e9in-supporting Michael Fogarty, as being 'full of simple and profound religious feeling'.\n\nO'Higgins' poem \"[[:wikisource:Who is Ireland's Enemy?|Who is Ireland's Enemy?]]\", was first published in September 1914 in  ''[[Irish Freedom]]'', in an edition entitled ''Germany Is Not Ireland's Enemy''; it became popular during the [[1918 Irish conscription crisis]]. According to Christopher M. Kennedy,  the poem was \"perhaps the most blatant example of using past wrongs committed by England to keep the old hatreds alive\".<ref>{{cite book |title=Genesis of the Rising, 1912\u20131916: A Transformation of Nationalist Opinion|last=Kennedy|first=Christopher M.|year=2010|publisher=Peter Lang|isbn=1433105004|ref=harv|p=99}}</ref>\n\n==Republican activity==\n\nO'Higgins was a founding member of the [[Irish Volunteers]] in 1913, which organised to work for Irish independence. On Easter Monday of 1916 he was in a group of Volunteers who were held at 41 Parnell Square as reserves, on account of their age, health or physical condition. This group was called to the GPO at six o'clock that evening. He was put on guard duty at the main entrance to the GPO and he later served under Quartermaster Michael Staines. He assisted in the evacuation of the wounded from the GPO on Friday evening and spent the night in a shed off Moore Street. He was deported to [[Stafford Gaol]] on May 1 and interned in [[Frongoch internment camp]] until February 1917.<ref name=nhs/>\n\nIn May 1918 he was arrested and deported to Birmingham Jail, and was elected Sinn F\u00e9in candidate for West Clare during the 1918 General Election.<ref name=oireachtas_db>{{cite web|url=https://www.oireachtas.ie/en/members/member/Brian-O'Higgins.D.1919-01-21/|title=Brian O'Higgins|work=Oireachtas Members Database|access-date=11 April 2009}}</ref>\n\nIn January 1919, Sinn F\u00e9in MPs who had been elected in the Westminster elections of 1918 refused to recognise the [[Parliament of the United Kingdom]] and instead assembled in [[Dublin]] as a revolutionary parliament called [[D\u00e1il \u00c9ireann (Irish Republic)|D\u00e1il \u00c9ireann]]. He was involved in the establishment of the [[D\u00e1il Courts|Republican courts]] in [[County Clare]].<ref name=mc/>\n\nO'Higgins was re-elected as a Sinn F\u00e9in [[Teachta D\u00e1la]] (TD) at the [[1921 Irish elections|1921]], [[1922 Irish general election|1922]] and [[1923 Irish general election|1923]] elections.\n\nHe opposed the [[Anglo-Irish Treaty]] and [[Anglo-Irish Treaty D\u00e1il vote|voted against]] it. During the [[Irish Civil War]], he was imprisoned in Oriel House, Mountjoy Jail and Tintown and went on hunger strike for twenty five days.<ref name=mc/>\n\nHe resigned from Sinn F\u00e9in in 1934<ref name=mc/> along with [[Mary MacSwiney]] in protest against the election of [[Michael O'Flanagan|Fr. Michael O'Flanagan]] as President citing that O'Flanagan had a state job and was \"on the pay-roll of a usurping government\".<ref name=pob>{{cite web |url=https://brianofbanba.wordpress.com/2018/05/10/compromise-and-confusion/ |language=English |title=Compromise and Confusion by Brian O\u2019Higgins |work=brianofbanba.wordpress.com}}</ref>\n\nIn December 1938, O'Higgins was one of a group of seven people, who had been elected to the [[Second D\u00e1il]] in 1921, who met with the [[IRA Army Council]] under [[Se\u00e1n Russell]]. At this meeting, the seven signed over what they believed was the authority of the Government of D\u00e1il \u00c9ireann to the Army Council. Henceforth, the IRA Army Council perceived itself to be the legitimate government of the [[Irish Republic]] and, on this basis, the IRA and Sinn F\u00e9in justified their rejection of the states of the [[Republic of Ireland]] and [[Northern Ireland]] and political [[abstentionism]] from their parliamentary institutions.\n\nToday, the dissident terrorist organisation [[Continuity Irish Republican Army|Continuity IRA]] claim to be the heirs of this legitimacy and believe to be the legitimate continuation of the original [[Irish Republican Army (1917\u201322)|Irish Republican Army]] or ''\u00d3glaigh na h\u00c9ireann''.<ref>{{cite book | last = van Engeland | first = Anisseh | authorlink = | title = From Terrorism to Politics (Ethics and Global Politics) | publisher = [[Ashgate Publishing]] | year = 2008 | page = 55 | doi =  | isbn = 978-0-7546-4990-8}}</ref>\n\n==Later life==\n\nFrom the late 1920s he ran a successful business publishing greeting cards, calendars and devotional materials decorated with Celtic designs and O'Higgins' own verses.\n\nFollowing the suppression of [[An Phoblacht]] in 1937, he founded and edited the [[Wolfe Tone Weekly]] from 1937\u20131939 until it was also banned by the Free State Government. From 1932 to 1962 he published the [[Wolfe Tone Annual]], from his business at 56 Parnell Square, Dublin. This popular series of volumes gave popular accounts of episodes in Irish history from a republican viewpoint and he intended to cheer and inspire those true to 'the Separatist Idea and devoted to the vindication of all those who have sacrificed themselves for the full Independence and Gaelicisation of Ireland'. O'higgins edited all the issues, and contributed much of the articles himself. \n\nHe was a devout Catholic and was heavily critical of those who tried to link the Republican struggle with socialism and communism. Several of his children became Catholic priests.\n\n==Death==\n\nO'Higgins died while praying in Saint Anthony's Church in Clontarf, on 10 March 1963 <ref name=pob>{{cite web |url=https://brianofbanba.wordpress.com/2018/05/10/brian-ohiggins-an-uncompromising-patriot/ |language=English |title=Brian O\u2019Higgins \u2013 An Uncompromising Patriot |work=brianofbanba.wordpress.com}}</ref>.

Also, the individual characters are reversed, or mirrored.

Although better known for his children's books and illustrations for Mark Twain and Lewis Carroll, he published two books of [[reversible figure|reversible illustrations]], in which the picture turns into a different image entirely when flipped [[Point_reflection|upside down]]. The last page in his book ''Topsys & Turvys'' contains the phrase THE END, which, when inverted, reads PUZZLE.

Some ambigrams feature a relationship between their [[Visual appearance|form]] and their content. Ambigrams usually fall into one of several categories:\n\n; 3-Dimensional : A design where an object is presented that will appear to read several letters or words when viewed from different angles. Such designs can be generated using [[constructive solid geometry]].{{citation needed|date=August 2013}}\n\n; Chain :A design where a word (or sometimes words) are interlinked, forming a repeating chain. Letters are usually overlapped meaning that a word will start partway through another word. Sometimes chain ambigrams are presented in the form of a circle.<ref name=\"John Langdon\">{{Cite news|url=http://www.johnlangdon.net/thoughts/types-of-ambigrams/|title=Types of Ambigrams {{!}} John Langdon|work=John Langdon|access-date=2018-10-17|language=en-US}}</ref> <!-- Please check the website as a reliable source.\nUsed for 13, 14, 16, and 17 -->\n\n; [[Dihedral prime|Dihedral]]: A natural mirror-image ambigram consisting of numerical digits.\n\n; Figure-ground :A design in which the spaces between the letters of one word form another word.<ref name=\"John Langdon\"/>\n\n; Fractal : A version of space-filling ambigrams where the tiled word branches from itself and then shrinks in a [[self-similar]] manner, forming a [[fractal]]. See [[Scott Kim]]'s fractal of the word \"TREE\" for an animated example.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.scottkim.com.previewc40.carrierzone.com/inversions/gallery/tree.html|title=Tree|last=Kim|first=Scott|date=1981|website=scottkim.com|publisher=|accessdate=6 November 2016}}</ref>\n\n; Mirror-image :A design that can be read when reflected in a mirror, usually as the same word or phrase both ways. Ambigrams that form different words when viewed in the mirror are also known as glass door ambigrams, because they can be printed on a glass door to be read differently when entering or exiting.<ref name=\"John Langdon\"/>\n\n; Multi-Lingual : An ambigram that can be read one way in one language and another way in a different language. Multi-lingual ambigrams can exist in all of the various styles of ambigrams, with multi-lingual perceptual shift ambigrams being particularly striking. The name '''sinosign''' has been proposed for the case of the shift being between [[Latin script]] and [[Hanzi|Chinese script]].{{citation needed|date=August 2013}}\n\n; Natural :A natural ambigram is a word that possesses one or more of the above symmetries when written in its natural state, requiring no typographic styling.  For example, the words \"dollop\", \"suns\" and \"pod\" form natural rotational ambigrams. In Korean,  \uacf0 (bear) and \ubb38 (door) form a natural rotational ambigram. In some fonts, the word \"swims\" forms a natural rotational ambigram. The word \"bud\" forms a natural mirror ambigram when reflected over a vertical axis, as does \"\u0644\u064a\u0628\u064a\u0627{{lrm}}\", the name of the country [[Libya]] in [[Arabic language|Arabic]]. The words \"CHOICE\" and \"OXIDE\", in all capitals, form natural mirror ambigrams when reflected over a horizontal axis.  The longest such word is CHECKBOOK. The word \"TOOTH\", in all capitals, forms a natural mirror ambigram when its letters are stacked vertically and reflected over a vertical axis.  See the article ''[[transformation of text]]'' for a discussion of letter symmetry.{{citation needed|date=August 2013}}\n\n;Perceptual Shift (Oscillation) :A design with no symmetry but can be read as two different words depending on how the curves of the letters are interpreted.<ref name=\"John Langdon\"/>\n\n; Rotational : A design that presents several instances of words when rotated through a fixed angle.  This is usually 180 degrees, but rotational ambigrams of other angles exist, for example 90 or 45 degrees.  The word spelled out from the alternative direction(s) is often the same, but may be a different word to the initially presented form.  A simple example is the lower-case abbreviation for \"Down\", ''dn'', which looks like the lower-case word ''up'' when rotated 180 degrees.{{citation needed|date=August 2013}}\n\n; [[Strobogrammatic number|Strobogrammatic]]: A natural rotational ambigram consisting of numerical digits.\n\n; Space-Filling : Similar to chain ambigrams, but tile to fill the 2-dimensional plane.{{citation needed|date=August 2013}}\n\n; Spinonym : An ambigram in which all the letters are made of the same glyph, possibly rotated and/or inverted.

Rather than going left-to-right as in modern European languages, or right-to-left as in [[Arabic language|Arabic]] and [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]], \nalternate lines in boustrophedon must be read in opposite directions. Also, the individual characters are reversed, or mirrored. It was a common way of writing in stone in [[Ancient Greece]].\n\nMirror writing in [[Islamic calligraphy]] flourished during the early modern period, but its origins may stretch as far back as pre-Islamic mirror-image rock inscriptions in the [[Hejaz]]. \n\nThe earliest known non-natural [[Point reflection|rotational]] ambigram dates to [[1893]] by artist [[Peter Newell]]. Although better known for his children's books and illustrations for Mark Twain and Lewis Carroll, he published two books of [[reversible figure|reversible illustrations]], in which the picture turns into a different image entirely when flipped [[Point_reflection|upside down]]. The last page in his book ''Topsys & Turvys'' contains the phrase THE END, which, when inverted, reads PUZZLE. In ''Topsys & Turvys Number 2'' (1902), Newell ended with a variation on the ambigram in which THE END changes into PUZZLE 2.\n\nIn March 1904 [[Gustave Verbeek]] used ambigrams{{which|date=April 2020}} in three consecutive strips of \"The UpsideDowns of old man Muffaroo and little lady Lovekins\".{{dubious|date=April 2020}} {{citation needed|date=February 2020}} The format of that strip otherwise prevented the use of word balloons.{{explain|date=April 2020}} His comics were [[ambiguous image|ambiguous images]], made in such a way that one could read the 6 panel comic, flip the book and keep reading.   \n\nFrom June to September 1908, the British monthly [[The Strand Magazine|''The Strand'']] published a series of ambigrams by different people in its \"[[Curiosities]]\" column.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite magazine|last=Newnes|first=George|date=1908|title=Curiosities|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=45MkAQAAIAAJ&pg=PA359&lpg=PA359&dq=Possibly+B+is+the+only+letter+of+the+alphabet+that+will+produce+such+an+interesting+anomaly&source=bl&ots=ScGLkirrWp&sig=DY-p5rSxj-fKc1MoJv7_sruTSws&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjXm8vdxJXQAhVGyyYKHbjiCKMQ6AEIIzAB|magazine=The Strand Magazine|issue=36|page=359|doi=|pmid=|access-date=6 November 2016}}</ref> Of particular interest is the fact that all four of the people submitting ambigrams believed them to be a rare property of particular words.

Some ambigrams feature a relationship between their [[Visual appearance|form]] and their content. Ambigrams usually fall into one of several categories:\n\n; 3-Dimensional : A design where an object is presented that will appear to read several letters or words when viewed from different angles. Such designs can be generated using [[constructive solid geometry]].{{citation needed|date=August 2013}}\n\n; Chain :A design where a word (or sometimes words) are interlinked, forming a repeating chain. Letters are usually overlapped meaning that a word will start partway through another word. Sometimes chain ambigrams are presented in the form of a circle.<ref name=\"John Langdon\">{{Cite news|url=http://www.johnlangdon.net/thoughts/types-of-ambigrams/|title=Types of Ambigrams {{!}} John Langdon|work=John Langdon|access-date=2018-10-17|language=en-US}}</ref> <!-- Please check the website as a reliable source.\nUsed for 13, 14, 16, and 17 -->\n\n; [[Dihedral prime|Dihedral]]: A natural mirror-image ambigram consisting of numerical digits.\n\n; Figure-ground :A design in which the spaces between the letters of one word form another word.<ref name=\"John Langdon\"/>\n\n; Fractal : A version of space-filling ambigrams where the tiled word branches from itself and then shrinks in a [[self-similar]] manner, forming a [[fractal]]. See [[Scott Kim]]'s fractal of the word \"TREE\" for an animated example.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.scottkim.com.previewc40.carrierzone.com/inversions/gallery/tree.html|title=Tree|last=Kim|first=Scott|date=1981|website=scottkim.com|publisher=|accessdate=6 November 2016}}</ref>\n\n; Mirror-image :A design that can be read when reflected in a mirror, usually as the same word or phrase both ways. Ambigrams that form different words when viewed in the mirror are also known as glass door ambigrams, because they can be printed on a glass door to be read differently when entering or exiting.<ref name=\"John Langdon\"/>\n\n; Multi-Lingual : An ambigram that can be read one way in one language and another way in a different language. Multi-lingual ambigrams can exist in all of the various styles of ambigrams, with multi-lingual perceptual shift ambigrams being particularly striking. The name '''sinosign''' has been proposed for the case of the shift being between [[Latin script]] and [[Hanzi|Chinese script]].{{citation needed|date=August 2013}}\n\n; Natural :A natural ambigram is a word that possesses one or more of the above symmetries when written in its natural state, requiring no typographic styling.  For example, the words \"dollop\", \"suns\" and \"pod\" form natural rotational ambigrams. In Korean,  \uacf0 (bear) and \ubb38 (door) form a natural rotational ambigram. In some fonts, the word \"swims\" forms a natural rotational ambigram. The word \"bud\" forms a natural mirror ambigram when reflected over a vertical axis, as does \"\u0644\u064a\u0628\u064a\u0627{{lrm}}\", the name of the country [[Libya]] in [[Arabic language|Arabic]]. The words \"CHOICE\" and \"OXIDE\", in all capitals, form natural mirror ambigrams when reflected over a horizontal axis.  The longest such word is CHECKBOOK. The word \"TOOTH\", in all capitals, forms a natural mirror ambigram when its letters are stacked vertically and reflected over a vertical axis.  See the article ''[[transformation of text]]'' for a discussion of letter symmetry.{{citation needed|date=August 2013}}\n\n;Perceptual Shift (Oscillation) :A design with no symmetry but can be read as two different words depending on how the curves of the letters are interpreted.<ref name=\"John Langdon\"/>\n\n; Rotational : A design that presents several instances of words when rotated through a fixed angle.  This is usually 180 degrees, but rotational ambigrams of other angles exist, for example 90 or 45 degrees.  The word spelled out from the alternative direction(s) is often the same, but may be a different word to the initially presented form.  A simple example is the lower-case abbreviation for \"Down\", ''dn'', which looks like the lower-case word ''up'' when rotated 180 degrees.{{citation needed|date=August 2013}}\n\n; [[Strobogrammatic number|Strobogrammatic]]: A natural rotational ambigram consisting of numerical digits.\n\n; Space-Filling : Similar to chain ambigrams, but tile to fill the 2-dimensional plane.{{citation needed|date=August 2013}}\n\n; Spinonym : An ambigram in which all the letters are made of the same glyph, possibly rotated and/or inverted. WEB is an example of a word that can easily be made into a spinonym. Previously called rotoglyphs or rotaglyphs.<ref>See Hofstadter, ''Ambigrammi'', p. 48.</ref>\n\n; Symbiotogram : An ambigram that, when rotated, can be read as a different word than the original, e.g., \"LIFE\" would read as \"DEATH\".<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=dWTaRp2-HDUC&lpg=PT51&ots=KuitFo8p1_&dq=symbiotogram&pg=PT51#v=onepage&q=symbiotogram&f=false|title=Ambigrams Revealed: A Graphic Designer's Guide To Creating Typographic Art Using Optical Illusions, Symmetry, and Visual Perception|last=Prokhorov|first=Nikita|publisher=New Riders|year=2013|isbn=9780133086461|location=|pages=51, 124|language=en|quote=|via=}}</ref>\n\n==Creating ambigrams==\n===Handmade designs===\n[[File:Ambigram tattoo New York Rich Man.jpg|thumb|Handmade ambigram for a [[tattoo]] \u00ab [[New_York_City#Wealth_and_income_disparity|New York / Rich Man]] \u00bb]]\nThere are no universal guidelines for creating ambigrams, and there are different ways of approaching problems.

He enjoyed it when the theme song of each organization is played during each battle, which reminded him of the heroes of [[Tokusatsu]].\n\nHe also stated that the production of the whole film is quite something in Japanese film history, writing \" Not only the action scenes, but the level of luxury in the subtleties of the art, sets, costumes, and novel techniques of photography is really something that can be said to be a rare quality in the history of Japanese cinema, something that can truly show the level of Japanese cinema.

However, as their leader Smoky's illness takes a turn for the worse, [[High&Low#Rude Boys|Rude Boys]] members who attend the summit of SWORD leaders in place of Smoky refuse the plan, saying that it's more important for them to survive.

After the death of their older brother Takeru, [[High&Low#The Amamiya Brothers|Masaki and Hiroto Amamiya]] gives the [[USB flash drive|USB]] with proof of politicians taking bribes from the Kuryu Group to Kohaku, who deeply regrets the mistakes he has made and wants to expose the evil of the Kuryu Group. Kuryu Group becomes aware of their plans of publicising information in the USB, and they send Genji Kuki, vice leader of Kurosakikai, to kill the Kohaku and his right arm man Tsukumo. \n\nTo end the feud between themselves and the alliance of Doubt and the Prison Gang, the White Rascals head to the fatal battle. When they are almost killed by their powerful enemy, Cobra, and other SWORD members, come to their rescue with the determination to protect the SWORD area as a whole from their enemies. At the same time, Kohaku,&nbsp; Tsukumo and the Amamiya brothers have to fight the formidable killer Genji Kuki.\n\nThe biggest fight that will determine the future of the SWORD area begins.

The pavilions were designed by [[New South Wales Government Architect|NSW Government Architect]] [[Walter Liberty Vernon]] in consultation with Mansfield Brothers and built from 1901 to 1904. They was added to the [[New South Wales State Heritage Register]] on 2 April 1999.<ref name=nswshr-829>{{cite NSW SHR|5012306|Royal Prince Alfred Hospital - Victoria & Albert Pavilions|hr=00829|fn=S90/07364/0|accessdate=13 October 2018}}</ref><ref name=\"shi\">{{cite NSW HD|3540002|Albert and Victoria Pavilion|date=|accessdate=26 October 2018}}</ref>\n\n== History ==\nThe Albert and Victoria Pavilions were designed as mirror-reverse twin pavilions attached to either side of the Administration Building, Albert for Males and Victoria for Females. They completed the original pavilion plan though their detailed design was contemporary. They were built to commemorate the death of [[Queen Victoria]] and were funded by donations. The two Pavilions were built 1901\u20131904 to a design by the Government Architect in consultation with Mansfield Brothers. The original design is shown on drawings PH213/142, 164 which are signed by W. L. Vernon as Government Architect and by George Oakeshott. The foundation stone was laid by the [[Duke of York]], the future King [[George V]]. There is reputed to have been a competition between public and private sectors in the completion on these buildings but this has not been substantiated.<ref name=shi />\n\nThe building was originally built as long wards with a central section for nurses, etc. This section projected at the rear (east) forming another wing accommodation, a special ward on the ground floor, and operating theatre on the first, incorporating a lift and stair. Access was by arcaded balcony on the eastern side. Toilet blocks were located at both ends of the pavilion separated by air locks which included a '[[dumbwaiter]]' type lift and a sink. Subsequent alterations included the enclosure of the balconies to form corridors and some sub-division of the wards.<ref name=shi />\n\nIn 1907 the operating theatres were completed incorporating the latest design and technology. An undated drawing PH213/48 shows alterations to the operating theatre. The interior is shown in an early photograph. Due to insufficient funds some wards remained closed for some years and nurses were accommodated on the top floor. In 1914 the top two floors were used as accommodation for nurses. Between 1918 and 1926, returned soldiers were accommodated on these floors and the [[Department of Defence (Australia)|Department of Defence]] funded and equipped the wards.<ref name=shi />\n\nThere have been various subsequent alterations and additions, particularly on the eastern and southern sides. part of the original building was demolished in {{circa}} 1935 to build the Fairfax Institute of Pathology fronting Missenden Road. In 1937 a new [[X-ray]] department was established in a single storey brick, flat roofed addition at the rear of the Victoria Pavilion. In 1956 lifts were installed in the building. In 1966 there were further additions to accommodate new equipment including additional storey on the 1937 additions. There were further additions to the rear of these buildings recently to accommodate a medical imaging facility (MRI). The main wing has been converted to offices and the large wards subdivided.<ref name=shi />\n\n== Description ==\n\n===Albert Pavilion===\n\nAlbert Pavilion is located on the northern side of the Administration Block. The original building consists of three levels above a basement, matching that of the Administration Blocks. It is a load bearing brick structure with concrete floors on steel beams and with a terracotta tiled roof. There is a single storey \"L\" shaped brick and fibro annex and new concrete and steel additions. The original drawings note the floor as terracotta lumber, balcony and bathrooms with silicate paving on Monier and location of wall vents is noted in detail.<ref name=shi />\n\nAlbert Pavilion is in the Federation Free Classical style, and is symmetrical about the projected bay of the central wing which is surmounted by a pediment bearing a copper clad statue of Prince Albert. It is fenestrated by regular banks of shuttered windows. The walls are of high quality red brickwork with stone dressing to sills string courses and the pediment, etc. the central bay and north ends have 'blood and bandages' detailing to the lower levels. Additions are described above and are largely insubstantial and insignificant structures. Most recent is the light weight metal structure forming the ambulance entry on the west (Missenden Road) side and a single and two storey concrete and steel addition on the east side near the Administration Building.<ref name=shi />\n\n===Victoria Pavilion===\n\nVictoria Pavilion is located on the southern side of the Administration Block. The original building consists of three levels above a basement, matching that of the Administration Blocks. There are later date additions to the original building including the 1935 Fairfax Institute of Pathology, the 1969 Haematology Department.<ref name=shi />\n\nThe original Victoria Pavilion is a load bearing brick structure with concrete floors on steel beam and with terracotta tiled hip roof. It is in the Federation Free Classical style, and is symmetrical about the pedimented bay of the central wing. There are regular banks of shuttered windows. The walls are of high quality red brick works with stone dressings. The building was originally built as long wards with a central wing for nurses. Access was by arcaded balcony on the eastern side. Toilet blocks were located at both ends of the pavilion separated by air locks which included a \"dumb waiter\" type lift and a sink. later balconies were closed to form corridors and wards subdivided.<ref name=shi />\n\nThe 1935 four storey extension is a steel and concrete framed structure with brick cladding and stone dressing and slate roof to match the original building. the 1969 addition at the rear of the original building is a two-storey brick structure with a concrete floor and flat roof.<ref name=shi />\n\nThe Victoria Pavilion and its later addition appear to be in reasonable condition except for damage from rusting arch bars on the southern wall. Despite substantial additions and internal alterations elements of original design survive such as stairs, toilet towers and external features.<ref name=shi />\n\n==Significance==\n\nBoth pavilions are of high significance for the following values:<ref name=shi />\n* an integral part of the early development of RPA Hospital\n* a surviving element of the original, symmetrical, master plan for the hospital\n* the surviving facades and roof form are finely detailed examples of Federation architecture\n* together with the Administration Building, the group has an important landmark quality as one of the most imposing facades in Sydney\n* the relationship of built form and landscaping to Missenden Road is very important to the streetscape\n* as a major surviving work executed under the Government Architect Walter Liberty Vernon\n\n== Heritage listing ==\nThe Victoria and Albert Pavilions form part of the [[Royal Prince Alfred Hospital]] Precinct which is of high historical and architectural significance.

They was added to the [[New South Wales State Heritage Register]] on 2 April 1999.<ref name=nswshr-829>{{cite NSW SHR|5012306|Royal Prince Alfred Hospital - Victoria & Albert Pavilions|hr=00829|fn=S90/07364/0|accessdate=13 October 2018}}</ref><ref name=\"shi\">{{cite NSW HD|3540002|Albert and Victoria Pavilion|date=|accessdate=26 October 2018}}</ref>\n\n== History ==\nThe Albert and Victoria Pavilions were designed as mirror-reverse twin pavilions attached to either side of the Administration Building, Albert for Males and Victoria for Females. They completed the original pavilion plan though their detailed design was contemporary. They were built to commemorate the death of [[Queen Victoria]] and were funded by donations. The two Pavilions were built 1901\u20131904 to a design by the Government Architect in consultation with Mansfield Brothers. The original design is shown on drawings PH213/142, 164 which are signed by W. L. Vernon as Government Architect and by George Oakeshott. The foundation stone was laid by the [[Duke of York]], the future King [[George V]]. There is reputed to have been a competition between public and private sectors in the completion on these buildings but this has not been substantiated.<ref name=shi />\n\nThe building was originally built as long wards with a central section for nurses, etc. This section projected at the rear (east) forming another wing accommodation, a special ward on the ground floor, and operating theatre on the first, incorporating a lift and stair. Access was by arcaded balcony on the eastern side. Toilet blocks were located at both ends of the pavilion separated by air locks which included a '[[dumbwaiter]]' type lift and a sink. Subsequent alterations included the enclosure of the balconies to form corridors and some sub-division of the wards.<ref name=shi />\n\nIn 1907 the operating theatres were completed incorporating the latest design and technology. An undated drawing PH213/48 shows alterations to the operating theatre. The interior is shown in an early photograph. Due to insufficient funds some wards remained closed for some years and nurses were accommodated on the top floor. In 1914 the top two floors were used as accommodation for nurses. Between 1918 and 1926, returned soldiers were accommodated on these floors and the [[Department of Defence (Australia)|Department of Defence]] funded and equipped the wards.<ref name=shi />\n\nThere have been various subsequent alterations and additions, particularly on the eastern and southern sides. part of the original building was demolished in {{circa}} 1935 to build the Fairfax Institute of Pathology fronting Missenden Road. In 1937 a new [[X-ray]] department was established in a single storey brick, flat roofed addition at the rear of the Victoria Pavilion. In 1956 lifts were installed in the building. In 1966 there were further additions to accommodate new equipment including additional storey on the 1937 additions. There were further additions to the rear of these buildings recently to accommodate a medical imaging facility (MRI). The main wing has been converted to offices and the large wards subdivided.<ref name=shi />\n\n== Description ==\n\n===Albert Pavilion===\n\nAlbert Pavilion is located on the northern side of the Administration Block. The original building consists of three levels above a basement, matching that of the Administration Blocks. It is a load bearing brick structure with concrete floors on steel beams and with a terracotta tiled roof. There is a single storey \"L\" shaped brick and fibro annex and new concrete and steel additions. The original drawings note the floor as terracotta lumber, balcony and bathrooms with silicate paving on Monier and location of wall vents is noted in detail.<ref name=shi />\n\nAlbert Pavilion is in the Federation Free Classical style, and is symmetrical about the projected bay of the central wing which is surmounted by a pediment bearing a copper clad statue of Prince Albert. It is fenestrated by regular banks of shuttered windows. The walls are of high quality red brickwork with stone dressing to sills string courses and the pediment, etc. the central bay and north ends have 'blood and bandages' detailing to the lower levels. Additions are described above and are largely insubstantial and insignificant structures. Most recent is the light weight metal structure forming the ambulance entry on the west (Missenden Road) side and a single and two storey concrete and steel addition on the east side near the Administration Building.<ref name=shi />\n\n===Victoria Pavilion===\n\nVictoria Pavilion is located on the southern side of the Administration Block. The original building consists of three levels above a basement, matching that of the Administration Blocks. There are later date additions to the original building including the 1935 Fairfax Institute of Pathology, the 1969 Haematology Department.<ref name=shi />\n\nThe original Victoria Pavilion is a load bearing brick structure with concrete floors on steel beam and with terracotta tiled hip roof. It is in the Federation Free Classical style, and is symmetrical about the pedimented bay of the central wing. There are regular banks of shuttered windows. The walls are of high quality red brick works with stone dressings. The building was originally built as long wards with a central wing for nurses. Access was by arcaded balcony on the eastern side. Toilet blocks were located at both ends of the pavilion separated by air locks which included a \"dumb waiter\" type lift and a sink. later balconies were closed to form corridors and wards subdivided.<ref name=shi />\n\nThe 1935 four storey extension is a steel and concrete framed structure with brick cladding and stone dressing and slate roof to match the original building. the 1969 addition at the rear of the original building is a two-storey brick structure with a concrete floor and flat roof.<ref name=shi />\n\nThe Victoria Pavilion and its later addition appear to be in reasonable condition except for damage from rusting arch bars on the southern wall. Despite substantial additions and internal alterations elements of original design survive such as stairs, toilet towers and external features.<ref name=shi />\n\n==Significance==\n\nBoth pavilions are of high significance for the following values:<ref name=shi />\n* an integral part of the early development of RPA Hospital\n* a surviving element of the original, symmetrical, master plan for the hospital\n* the surviving facades and roof form are finely detailed examples of Federation architecture\n* together with the Administration Building, the group has an important landmark quality as one of the most imposing facades in Sydney\n* the relationship of built form and landscaping to Missenden Road is very important to the streetscape\n* as a major surviving work executed under the Government Architect Walter Liberty Vernon\n\n== Heritage listing ==\nThe Victoria and Albert Pavilions form part of the [[Royal Prince Alfred Hospital]] Precinct which is of high historical and architectural significance.
