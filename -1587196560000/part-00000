The city is located nearly within the same distance to the three nearest seas: [[the Baltic]], [[Adriatic sea|the Adriatic]] and [[the Black Sea]] (650-690 km) making it the most inland city in this part of [[Europe]]. It is the [[Capital (political)|administrative center]] of [[Zakarpattia Oblast]] ([[oblast|region]]), as well as the administrative center of the surrounding [[Uzhhorod Raion]] ([[raion|district]]) within the oblast. The city itself is also designated as [[City of regional significance (Ukraine)|city of oblast significance]], a status equivalent to that of a raion, and does not belong to Uzhhorod Raion. Population: {{Ua-pop-est2016|115,163}}.\n\n==Name==\nThe historical name of the city is Hungarian, '''Ungv\u00e1r'''. The Rusyn name '''Uzhhorod''' is a recent construct, and has been used only since the beginning of the 20th century.\n\nThe town is also known by several alternative names: {{lang-cz|U\u017ehorod}}; {{lang-sk|U\u017ehorod}}; {{lang-de|link=no|Ungwar, Ungarisch Burg}}; {{lang-pl|U\u017chorod}}; {{lang-ro|Ujgorod}}.\n\n===Uzhhorod===\nThe city gets its name from the [[Uzh River]], which divides the city into two parts (the old and new sections), while ''horod'' (\u0433\u043e\u0440\u043e\u0434) is Rusyn for ''city'', coming from [[Proto-Slavic|Old Slavonic]] ''[[Grad (geography)|grad]]'' (\u0433\u0440\u0430\u0434\u044a).  \n\n===Ungv\u00e1r===\n'''Ungv\u00e1r''', also spelled Ongv\u00e1r, Hungv\u00e1r, and Unguyvar, is derived from ''Ung'', the Hungarian name for the Uzh (as well as the surrounding county) and ''v\u00e1r'', meaning ''castle, fort''.\n\n==History==\n{{Quote box\n| width = 23em\n| align = left\n| bgcolor = #B0C4DE\n| title = Historical affiliations<ref>[https://books.google.nl/books?id=WIUE8Y9-wYAC&pg=PA245&dq=hungary+uzhgorod&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjSw9fk25PXAhVDlxoKHRIzAGMQ6AEIVzAJ#v=onepage&q=hungary%20uzhgorod&f=false 'The Great Experiment: The Story of Ancient Empires, Modern States, and the Quest for a Global Nation'] by [[Strobe Talbott]], 2008 (page 243)</ref>\n| fontsize = 90%\n| quote = {{flagicon image|Flag_of_Hungary_(11th_c._-_1301).svg}} [[Principality of Hungary]] 895\u20131000<br>\n{{flagicon image|Flag_of_Hungary_(15th_century,_rectangular).svg}} [[Kingdom of Hungary]] 1000\u20131526<br>\n{{flagicon image|Flag_of_the_Habsburg_Monarchy.svg}} [[Kingdom of Hungary (1526\u20131867)|Kingdom of Hungary]] 1526\u20131804<br>\n{{flagicon image|Flag_of_the_Habsburg_Monarchy.svg}} [[Kingdom of Hungary (1526\u20131867)|Kingdom of Hungary]]  ''(crownland of the [[Austrian Empire]] 1804\u20131867)<br>\n{{flagicon image|Flag_of_Austria-Hungary_(1869-1918).svg}} [[Austria-Hungary|Austro-Hungarian Empire]] 1867\u20131918<br>\n{{flag|Czechoslovakia}} 1920\u20131938<br>\n{{flagicon image|Flag_of_Hungary_(1920\u20131946).svg}} [[Kingdom of Hungary (1920\u201346)|Kingdom of Hungary]] 1938\u20131945<br>\n{{flag|Soviet Union}} 1945\u20131991<br>\n{{flag|Ukraine}} 1991\u2013present\n}}\n\n===Early history===\n====Slavic beginnings====\nThe best known of the first city founders are [[early Slavs]].

The forces were not equal and Laborec was defeated and beheaded on the banks of the river that still carries his name. Again, this is mythical. There was not much of a settlement when the Magyar tribes arrived, having left Kiev (then known as Kevevara) and encountering no resistance.\n\n====10th-15th centuries====\n[[File:\u0413\u043e\u0440\u044f\u043d\u0441\u044c\u043a\u0430 \u0446\u0435\u0440\u043a\u0432\u0430 \u0421\u0432.\u041c\u0438\u043a\u043e\u043b\u0438 140503 2333.jpg|thumbnail|11th-century Rotunda in Horiany]]\n\nAfter the arrival of the Hungarians, the small town began to extend its borders. In 1241\u20131242 the [[Mongols]] of [[Batu Khan]] burnt the settlement. After, in 1248 the city was granted town privileges by the [[B\u00e9la IV of Hungary|King B\u00e9la IV of Hungary]]. In the early 14th century, Uzhhorod showed strong resistance to the new Hungarian rulers of the [[Capetian House of Anjou|Anjou dynasty]]. Although the majority of inhabitants were Hungarians, they wanted more freedom. From 1318 for 360 years, the [[Drugeth]]s (Italian counts from the Kingdom of Naples) owned the town. During that period [[Philip Drugeth]] built [[Uzhhorod Castle]], the name Ungvar in Hungarian meaning Castle of Ung. Together with the castle, the city began to grow. From 1430, Uzhhorod became a free royal town.\n\n[[File:Uzhhorod-castle-hill-view.jpg|thumb|Uzhhorod Castle]]\n\n====16th-18th centuries====\nDuring the 16\u201317th centuries there were many handicraft corporations in Uzhhorod. In this period the city was engaged in the religious fight between primarily [[Protestant]] [[Transylvania]] and [[Roman Catholic Church|Catholic]] [[Austria]]. In 1646 the [[Union of Uzhhorod]] was proclaimed and the [[Greek-Catholic]] church was established in Subcarpathia, in a ceremony held in the Ungvar castle by the [[Vatican City|Vatican]] Aegis. In 1707 Ungvar was the residence of [[Ferenc II R\u00e1k\u00f3czi]], leader of the national liberation war of Hungarians against [[Vienna]].\n[[File:Maria Theresia First Private Garden Square, Uzhgorod.png|thumb|[[Maria Theresia Garden Square (Uzhhorod)|Maria Theresia Garden Square]] ]]\n\n====19th century====\nThe beginning of the 19th century was characterized by economic changes, including the first factories in the city. The greatest influence on Ungvar among the political events of the 19th century was made by the [[Hungarian Revolution of 1848]]-1849, during which the native Hungarian nobility sought both shake off the suzerainty of the [[Austrian Empire]] and to have authority over their own people. 27 March 1848 was officially celebrated in the city as the overthrow of the monarchy in Hungary. It is now celebrated in Hungary on 15 March.\n\nIn 1872 the first railway line opened, linking the city to the important railway junction of [[Chop, Ukraine|Chop]], then known as Csap.\n\n====Twentieth century====\nAccording to the 1910 census, the city had 16,919 inhabitants, of which 13,590 (80.3%) were [[Magyars]], 1,219 (7.2%) [[Slovaks]], 1,151 (6.8%) [[Germans]], 641 (3.8%) [[Rusyns]] and 1.6% [[Czech people|Czechs]].<ref>Atlas and Gazetteer of Historic Hungary 1914, [http://www.talmakiado.hu/ Talma Kiad\u00f3] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170114044438/http://www.talmakiado.hu/ |date=14 January 2017 }}</ref> Since Jews were not counted as ethnicity (as defined by language), rather only religious group, this Austrian-Hungarian census does not specifically mention the Jewish population, which was significant, and represented about 31% of the total population in 1910.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://kehilalinks.jewishgen.org/Uzhhorod/|title=Uzhhorod (Ungv\u00e1r), Ukraine KehilaLink|last=KATZ|first=Marshall J.|website=kehilalinks.jewishgen.org|access-date=8 May 2017}}</ref>  In the same time, the municipal area of the city had a population composed of 10,541 (39.05%) Hungarians, 9,908 (36.71%) Slovaks, and 5,520 (20.45%) Rusyns.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.talmamedia.com/php/district/district.php?county=Ung |title=Ung County |accessdate=17 March 2007 |work=Genealogy Online  |publisher=}}</ref>\n\nThe [[First World War]] slowed down the tempo of city development. On 10 September 1919, [[Carpathian Ruthenia|Subcarpathia]] was officially allocated to the Republic of [[Czechoslovakia]]. Uzhhorod became the administrative center of the territory. During these years Uzhhorod developed into an architecturally modern city.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://am.umodernism.com/en/|title=Uzhhorod Modernism|website=am.umodernism.com|access-date=2019-06-28}}</ref> After the [[Treaty of Trianon]] 1920, Uzhhorod became part of the eastern half of the new Czecho-Slovak state.\n\nAfter the [[First Vienna Award]] in 1938, Uzhhorod was given back to [[Hungary]] from which it was separated after WWI.\n\nIn 1941 the Jewish population reached 9,576. On 19 March 1944, Germans troops entered the city. They established a [[Judenrat]] ''(Jewish council)'' and set up 2 ghettos, at the Moskovitz brickyard and at the Gluck lumberyard. During May 1944, all Jews were deported to Auschwitz in 5 different transports and subsequently murdered. Only a few hundred Jews survived.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://kehilalinks.jewishgen.org/Uzhhorod/|title=Uzhorod |accessdate=22 March 2017 |work=Kehilalinks|publisher=}}</ref>\n[[File:\u0422\u0435\u0430\u0442\u0440\u0430\u043b\u044c\u043d\u0430 10 (1).jpg|thumb|Uzhhorod's former [[Uzhhorod Synagogue|synagogue]], now the Philharmonic Orchestra.]]\n\nOn 27 October 1944, the city was captured by the troops of the [[4th Ukrainian Front]] of the [[Red Army]]. {{citation needed|date=April 2018}} Thousands of ethnic Hungarians were killed, expelled, or else taken to work in Soviet forced labor camps.{{citation needed|date=April 2018}} The Hungarian majority population was decimated in order to strengthen the Soviet and Ukrainian right to the city. {{citation needed|date=April 2018}}\n\nThis period brought significant changes. On the outskirts of Uzhhorod new enterprises were constructed and the old enterprises were renewed.{{citation needed|date=April 2018}} On 29 June 1945, Subcarpathian Ukraine was annexed by the [[Soviet Union]] and became a westernmost part of the [[Ukrainian SSR]]. That year the [[Uzhhorod National University|Uzhhorod State University]] (now ''Uzhhorod National University'') was also opened. Since January 1946 Uzhhorod was the center of newly formed Zakarpatska oblast.{{ref}}\n\nSince 1991 Uzhhorod has become one of 24 regional capitals within Ukraine. Of these, Uzhhorod is the smallest and westernmost.\n\n====Twenty-first century====\nIn 2002, after some controversy,{{by whom|date=May 2012}} a bust of [[Tom\u00e1\u0161 Masaryk]], Czechoslovakia's first president, was unveiled in a main square of the city. A similar bust was unveiled in 1928 on the 10th anniversary of Czechoslovak independence, but was removed by the Hungarians when they took over the region in 1939.<ref>PRECL\u00cdK, Vratislav: \"Profesor Masaryk a Podkarpatsk\u00e1 Rus pr\u00e1v\u011b p\u0159ed sto lety\" (Professor Masaryk and Subcarpatian Russia just hundred years ago), in \u010cas: \u010dasopis Masarykova demokratick\u00e9ho hnut\u00ed, leden - b\u0159ezen 2019, ro\u010d.XXVII. \u010d\u00eds. 125.

Hungarian; {{Lang-de|text=Ungwar}}) is a city located in western [[Ukraine]], at the border with [[Slovakia]] and near the border with [[Hungary]]. The city is located nearly within the same distance to the three nearest seas: [[the Baltic]], [[Adriatic sea|the Adriatic]] and [[the Black Sea]] (650-690 km) making it the most inland city in this part of [[Europe]].

In 1241\u20131242 the [[Mongols]] of [[Batu Khan]] burnt the settlement. After, in 1248 the city was granted town privileges by the [[B\u00e9la IV of Hungary|King B\u00e9la IV of Hungary]]. In the early 14th century, Uzhhorod showed strong resistance to the new Hungarian rulers of the [[Capetian House of Anjou|Anjou dynasty]]. Although the majority of inhabitants were Hungarians, they wanted more freedom. From 1318 for 360 years, the [[Drugeth]]s (Italian counts from the Kingdom of Naples) owned the town. During that period [[Philip Drugeth]] built [[Uzhhorod Castle]], the name Ungvar in Hungarian meaning Castle of Ung. Together with the castle, the city began to grow. From 1430, Uzhhorod became a free royal town.\n\n[[File:Uzhhorod-castle-hill-view.jpg|thumb|Uzhhorod Castle]]\n\n====16th-18th centuries====\nDuring the 16\u201317th centuries there were many handicraft corporations in Uzhhorod. In this period the city was engaged in the religious fight between primarily [[Protestant]] [[Transylvania]] and [[Roman Catholic Church|Catholic]] [[Austria]]. In 1646 the [[Union of Ungvar|Ungvar Union]] was proclaimed and the [[Greek-Catholic]] church was established in Subcarpathia, in a ceremony held in the Ungvar castle by the [[Vatican City|Vatican]] Aegis. In 1707 Ungvar was the residence of [[Ferenc II R\u00e1k\u00f3czi]], leader of the national liberation war of Hungarians against [[Vienna]].\n[[File:Maria Theresia First Private Garden Square, Uzhgorod.png|thumb|[[Maria Theresia Garden Square (Uzhhorod)|Maria Theresia Garden Square]] ]]\n\n====19th century====\nThe beginning of the 19th century was characterized by economic changes, including the first factories in the city. The greatest influence on Ungvar among the political events of the 19th century was made by the [[Hungarian Revolution of 1848]]-1849, during which the native Hungarian nobility sought both shake off the suzerainty of the [[Austrian Empire]] and to have authority over their own people. 27 March 1848 was officially celebrated in the city as the overthrow of the monarchy in Hungary. It is now celebrated in Hungary on 15 March.\n\nIn 1872 the first railway line opened, linking the city to the important railway junction of [[Chop, Ukraine|Chop]], then known as Csap.\n\n====Twentieth century====\nAccording to the 1910 census, the city had 16,919 inhabitants, of which 13,590 (80.3%) were [[Magyars]], 1,219 (7.2%) [[Slovaks]], 1,151 (6.8%) [[Germans]], 641 (3.8%) [[Rusyns]] and 1.6% [[Czech people|Czechs]].<ref>Atlas and Gazetteer of Historic Hungary 1914, [http://www.talmakiado.hu/ Talma Kiad\u00f3] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170114044438/http://www.talmakiado.hu/ |date=14 January 2017 }}</ref> Since Jews were not counted as ethnicity (as defined by language), rather only religious group, this Austrian-Hungarian census does not specifically mention the Jewish population, which was significant, and represented about 31% of the total population in 1910.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://kehilalinks.jewishgen.org/Uzhhorod/|title=Uzhhorod (Ungv\u00e1r), Ukraine KehilaLink|last=KATZ|first=Marshall J.|website=kehilalinks.jewishgen.org|access-date=8 May 2017}}</ref>  In the same time, the municipal area of the city had a population composed of 10,541 (39.05%) Hungarians, 9,908 (36.71%) Slovaks, and 5,520 (20.45%) Rusyns.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.talmamedia.com/php/district/district.php?county=Ung |title=Ung County |accessdate=17 March 2007 |work=Genealogy Online  |publisher=}}</ref>\n\nThe [[First World War]] slowed down the tempo of city development. On 10 September 1919, [[Carpathian Ruthenia|Subcarpathia]] was officially allocated to the Republic of [[Czechoslovakia]]. Uzhhorod became the administrative center of the territory. During these years Uzhhorod developed into an architecturally modern city.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://am.umodernism.com/en/|title=Uzhhorod Modernism|website=am.umodernism.com|access-date=2019-06-28}}</ref> After the [[Treaty of Trianon]] 1920, Uzhhorod became part of the eastern half of the new Czecho-Slovak state.\n\nAfter the [[First Vienna Award]] in 1938, Uzhhorod was given back to [[Hungary]] from which it was separated after WWI.\n\nIn 1941 the Jewish population reached 9,576. On 19 March 1944, Germans troops entered the city. They established a [[Judenrat]] ''(Jewish council)'' and set up 2 ghettos, at the Moskovitz brickyard and at the Gluck lumberyard. During May 1944, all Jews were deported to Auschwitz in 5 different transports and subsequently murdered. Only a few hundred Jews survived.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://kehilalinks.jewishgen.org/Uzhhorod/|title=Uzhorod |accessdate=22 March 2017 |work=Kehilalinks|publisher=}}</ref>\n[[File:\u0422\u0435\u0430\u0442\u0440\u0430\u043b\u044c\u043d\u0430 10 (1).jpg|thumb|Uzhhorod's former [[Uzhhorod Synagogue|synagogue]], now the Philharmonic Orchestra.]]\n\nOn 27 October 1944, the city was captured by the troops of the [[4th Ukrainian Front]] of the [[Red Army]]. {{citation needed|date=April 2018}} Thousands of ethnic Hungarians were killed, expelled, or else taken to work in Soviet forced labor camps.{{citation needed|date=April 2018}} The Hungarian majority population was decimated in order to strengthen the Soviet and Ukrainian right to the city. {{citation needed|date=April 2018}}\n\nThis period brought significant changes.

That year the [[Uzhhorod National University|Uzhhorod State University]] (now ''Uzhhorod National University'') was also opened. Since January 1946 Uzhhorod was the center of newly formed Zakarpatska oblast.{{ref}}\n\nSince 1991 Uzhhorod has become one of 24 regional capitals within Ukraine.
