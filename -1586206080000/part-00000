For instance, an unstressed [[close vowel]] in the final syllable of a word is rare.<ref>{{Harvcoltxt|Harris|1969|pp=78, 145}}. Examples include words of Greek origin like ''\u00e9nfasis'' {{IPA|/\u02c8enfasis/}} ('emphasis'); the clitics ''su'' {{IPA|/su/}}, ''tu'' {{IPA|/tu/}}, ''mi'' {{IPA|/mi/}}; the three Latin words ''esp\u00edritu'' {{IPA|/es\u02c8pi\u027eitu/}} ('spirit'), ''tribu'' {{IPA|/\u02c8t\u027eibu/}} ('tribe'), and ''\u00edmpetu'' {{IPA|/\u02c8impetu/}} ('impetus'); and affective words like ''mami'' {{IPA|/\u02c8mami/}} and ''papi'' {{IPA|/\u02c8papi/}}.</ref>\n\nBecause of substratal Quechua, at least some speakers from southern Colombia down through Peru can be analyzed to have only three vowel phonemes {{IPA|/i, u, a/}}, as the close {{IPA|[i, u]}} are continually confused with the mid {{IPA|[e, o]}}, resulting in pronunciations such as {{IPA|[dol\u02c8so\u027ea]}} for ''dulzura'' ('sweetness'). When Quechua-dominant bilinguals have {{IPA|/e, o/}} in their phonemic inventory, they realize them as {{IPA|[{{IPAplink|\u026a}}, {{IPAplink|\u028a}}]}}, which are heard by outsiders as variants of {{IPA|/i, u/}}.<ref>{{Harvcoltxt|Cotton|Sharp|1988|p=182}}</ref> Both of those features are viewed as strongly non-standard by other speakers.\n\n===Allophones===\nPhonetic nasalization occurs for vowels occurring between nasal consonants or when preceding a syllable-final nasal, e.g. ''cinco'' {{IPA|[\u02c8\u03b8\u0129\u014bko]}} ('five').<ref name=\"carrera256\"/>\n\nArguably, Eastern Andalusian and Murcian Spanish have ten phonemic vowels, with each of the above vowels paired by a lowered or fronted and lengthened version, e.g. ''la madre'' {{IPA|[la \u02c8ma\u00f0\u027ee]}} ('the mother') vs. ''las madres'' {{IPA|[l\u00e6\u031e\u02d0 \u02c8m\u00e6\u031e\u02d0\u00f0\u027e\u025b\u02d0]}} ('the mothers').<ref>{{Harvcoltxt|Zamora Vicente|1967|p=?}}. The first {{IPA|/a/}} in ''madres'' also undergoes this fronting process as part of a vowel harmony system. See [[#Realization of /s/]] below.</ref>  However, these are more commonly analyzed as allophones triggered by an underlying {{IPA|/s/}} that is subsequently deleted.\n\n====Exact number of allophones====\nThere is no agreement among scholars on how many vowel allophones Spanish has; an often<ref>See e.g. {{Harvcoltxt|Mart\u00ednez Celdr\u00e1n|Fern\u00e1ndez Planas|Carrera Sabat\u00e9|2003}}</ref> postulated number is five {{IPA|[{{IPAplink|i}}, {{IPAplink|u}}, {{IPAplink|e\u031e}}, {{IPAplink|o\u031e}}, {{IPAplink|a\u0320}}]}}.\n\nSome scholars,<ref>Such as {{Harvcoltxt|Navarro Tom\u00e1s|1918}}</ref> however, state that Spanish has ''eleven'' allophones: the close and mid vowels have close {{IPA|[{{IPAplink|i}}, {{IPAplink|u}}, {{IPAplink|e}}, {{IPAplink|o}}]}} and open {{IPA|[{{IPAplink|i\u031e}}, {{IPAplink|u\u031e}}, {{IPAplink|\u025b}}, {{IPAplink|\u0254}}]}} allophones, whereas {{IPA|/a/}} appears in front {{IPAblink|a}}, central {{IPAblink|a\u0320}} and back {{IPAblink|\u0251}} variants.

While many diphthongs are historically the result of a recategorization of vowel sequences (hiatus) as diphthongs, there is still lexical contrast between diphthongs and [[Hiatus (linguistics)|hiatus]].<ref>{{Harvcoltxt|Chi\u021boran|Hualde|2007|p=45}}</ref>  There are also some lexical items that vary amongst speakers and dialects between hiatus and diphthong: words like ''bi\u00f3logo'' ('biologist') with a potential diphthong in the first syllable and words like ''di\u00e1logo'' with a stressed or pretonic sequence of {{IPA|/i/}} and a vowel vary between a diphthong and hiatus.<ref>{{Harvcoltxt|Chi\u021boran|Hualde|2007|p=46}}</ref>  {{Harvcoltxt|Chi\u021boran|Hualde|2007}} hypothesize that this is because vocalic sequences are longer in these positions.\n\nIn addition to [[synalepha]] across word boundaries, sequences of vowels in hiatus become diphthongs in fast speech; when this happens, one vowel becomes non-syllabic (unless they are the same vowel, in which case they fuse together) as in ''poeta'' {{IPA|[\u02c8po\u032feta]}} ('poet') and ''maestro'' {{IPA|[\u02c8mae\u032fst\u027eo]}} ('teacher').<ref>{{Harvcoltxt|Mart\u00ednez Celdr\u00e1n|Fern\u00e1ndez Planas|Carrera Sabat\u00e9|2003|pp=256\u2013257}}</ref>  Similarly, the relatively rare diphthong {{IPA|/eu/}} may be reduced to {{IPA|[u]}} in certain unstressed contexts, as in ''Eufemia'', {{IPA|[u\u02c8femja]}}.<ref>{{Harvcoltxt|Cotton|Sharp|1988|p=18}}</ref>  In the case of verbs like ''aliviar'' ('relieve'), diphthongs result from the suffixation of normal verbal morphology onto a stem-final {{IPA|/j/}} (that is, ''aliviar'' would be |{{IPA|alibj}}| + |{{IPA|ar}}|).<ref>{{Harvcoltxt|Harris|1969|pp=99\u2013101}}.</ref>  This contrasts with verbs like ''ampliar'' ('to extend') which, by their verbal morphology, seem to have stems ending in {{IPA|/i/}}.<ref>See {{Harvcoltxt|Harris|1969|pp=147\u2013148}} for a more extensive list of verb stems ending in both high vowels, as well as their corresponding semivowels.</ref>  Spanish also possesses [[triphthong]]s like {{IPA|/wei/}} and, in dialects that use a second person plural conjugation, {{IPA|/jai/}}, {{IPA|/jei/}}, and {{IPA|/wai/}} (e.g. ''buey'', 'ox'; ''cambi\u00e1is'', 'you change'; ''cambi\u00e9is'', '(that) you may change'; and ''averigu\u00e1is'', 'you ascertain').<ref>{{Harvcoltxt|Saporta|1956|p=290}}</ref>\n\nNon-syllabic {{IPA|/e/}} and {{IPA|/o/}} can be reduced to {{IPA|[\u029d]}}, {{IPA|[w\u031d]}}, as in ''beatitud'' {{IPA|[b\u029dati\u02c8tu\u00f0]}} ('beatitude') and ''poetisa'' {{IPA|[pw\u031de\u02c8tisa]}} ('poetess'), respectively; similarly, non-syllabic {{IPA|/a/}} can be completely elided, as in (e.g. ''ahorita'' {{IPA|[o\u02c8\u027eita]}} 'right away').  The frequency (though not the presence) of this phenomenon differs amongst dialects, with a number having it occur rarely and others exhibiting it always.<ref>{{Harvcoltxt| Bowen|Stockwell|1955|p=237}}</ref>\n\n==Prosody==\nSpanish is usually considered a [[Syllable-timed language#Syllable timing|syllable-timed language]].

The other 20% of the time, stress falls on the ultima and antepenultima (third-to-last syllable).<ref name=\"Lle\u00f3\">{{Harvcoltxt|Lle\u00f3|2003|p=262}}</ref>\n\nNonverbs are generally [[Stress (linguistics)|stressed]] on the penultimate syllable for vowel-final words and on the final syllable of consonant-final words. Exceptions are marked orthographically (see below), whereas regular words are underlyingly phonologically marked with a stress feature [+stress].<ref>{{Harvcoltxt|Hochberg|1988|p=684}}</ref>\n\nIn addition to exceptions to these tendencies, particularly learned words from Greek and Latin that feature antepenultimate stress, there are numerous [[minimal pair]]s which contrast solely on stress such as ''s\u00e1bana'' ('sheet') and ''sabana'' ('savannah'), as well as ''l\u00edmite'' ('boundary'), ''limite'' ('[that] he/she limit')<!-- sic: \"limit\" is subjunctive here --> and ''limit\u00e9'' ('I limited').\n\nLexical stress may be marked orthographically with an [[acute accent]] (''\u00e1cido'', ''distinci\u00f3n'', etc.).  This is done according to the mandatory stress rules of [[Spanish orthography]], which are similar to the tendencies above (differing with words like ''distinci\u00f3n'') and are defined so as to unequivocally indicate where the stress lies in a given written word.  An acute accent may also be used to differentiate homophones, such as ''mi'' (my), and ''m\u00ed'' (me).

When Quechua-dominant bilinguals have {{IPA|/e, o/}} in their phonemic inventory, they realize them as {{IPA|[{{IPAplink|\u026a}}, {{IPAplink|\u028a}}]}}, which are heard by outsiders as variants of {{IPA|/i, u/}}.<ref>{{Harvcoltxt|Cotton|Sharp|1988|p=182}}</ref> Both of those features are viewed as strongly non-standard by other speakers.\n\n===Allophones===\nPhonetic nasalization occurs for vowels occurring between nasal consonants or when preceding a syllable-final nasal, e.g. ''cinco'' {{IPA|[\u02c8\u03b8\u0129\u014bko]}} ('five').<ref name=\"carrera256\"/>\n\nArguably, Eastern Andalusian and Murcian Spanish have ten phonemic vowels, with each of the above vowels paired by a lowered or fronted and lengthened version, e.g. ''la madre'' {{IPA|[la \u02c8ma\u00f0\u027ee]}} ('the mother') vs. ''las madres'' {{IPA|[l\u00e6\u031e\u02d0 \u02c8m\u00e6\u031e\u02d0\u00f0\u027e\u025b\u02d0]}} ('the mothers').<ref>{{Harvcoltxt|Zamora Vicente|1967|p=?}}.

This is done according to the mandatory stress rules of [[Spanish orthography]], which are similar to the tendencies above (differing with words like ''distinci\u00f3n'') and are defined so as to unequivocally indicate where the stress lies in a given written word.  An acute accent may also be used to differentiate homophones, such as ''mi'' (my), and ''m\u00ed'' (me). In such cases, the accent is used on the homophone that normally receives greater stress when used in a sentence.\n\nLexical stress patterns are different between words carrying verbal and nominal inflection: in addition to the occurrence of verbal affixes with stress (something absent in nominal inflection), underlying stress also differs in that it falls on the last syllable of the inflectional stem in verbal words while those of nominal words may have ultimate or penultimate stress.<ref>{{Harvcoltxt|Garc\u00eda-Bellido|1997|pp=473\u2013474}}</ref>  In addition, amongst sequences of clitics suffixed to a verb, the rightmost clitic may receive secondary stress, e.g. ''b\u00fascalo'' {{IPA|/\u02c8buska\u02cclo/}} ('look for it').<ref>{{Harvcoltxt|Garc\u00eda-Bellido|1997|p=486}}, citing {{Harvcoltxt|Navarro Tom\u00e1s|1917|pp=381\u2013382, 385}}</ref>\n\n==Alternations==\nA number of alternations exist in Spanish that reflect diachronic changes in the language and arguably reflect [[morphophonological]] processes rather than strictly phonological ones.

The epenthetic {{IPA|/e/}} is pronounced even when it is not reflected in spelling (e.g. the surname of [[Carlos Slim]] is pronounced {{IPA|/es\u02c8lin/}}).

At the time, soccer was largely ignored by the national media, and the game was understood and played by a very small percentage of the population; but Seattle's post-war immigrants from Scandinavia and Britain had brought awareness of soccer, and a youth soccer league had started in 1966.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.washingtonyouthsoccer.org/50th_anniversary/|title=50th Anniversary - Washington Youth Soccer|website=Washington Youth Soccer}}</ref> Whether professional soccer could work in Seattle was anyone's guess.\n\nThe answer came at the club's inaugural game, when the Sounders took on the [[Denver Dynamos]] in Memorial Stadium, whose capacity of 13000 was considered ample for a sport which had never averaged more than 3000\u20135000 in other American cities. Over 12000 came to the opening match, the start of which was delayed to allow the unexpectedly large walk-up crowd to enter the stands. Longtime Seattle sportswriter [[Royal Brougham]] introduced the team to great fanfare, though he was booed when he chose to sing, \"Take Me Out to the Ballgame\", as Seattle sports fans were still embittered over the loss a few years earlier of the [[Seattle Pilots]] [[Major League Baseball]] team. It appeared Seattle was ready to embrace a different summer sport.\n\nThe Sounders won their home opener 4\u20131, and fans were hooked. By early summer, the Sounders stunned the American sports community by posting the first-ever sellout of a stadium for a soccer game, drawing 13,498 to their game against the defending champion [[Philadelphia Atoms]]. The Sounders proved successful on the field as well, with a 10\u20137\u20133 record, and Barry Watling won Goalkeeper of the Year honors with an astounding 0.80 goals against average. 36000 tickets were printed in anticipation of a home playoff game to be held in Husky Stadium. Despite their winning record, the NASL points system meant Seattle was edged out of the final playoff spot on the last day of the season, and they finished in third place in the highly competitive Western Conference that year.\n\nThe Sounders returned in 1975 with the addition of [[Tottenham Hotspur]] defender and [[UEFA Cup]] winner [[Mike England]] to anchor the defensive midfield. The success of the Sounders and other western teams led other teams to boost their lineups as well, including the signing of [[Pele]] by the [[New York Cosmos (1970\u201385)|New York Cosmos]]. Memorial Stadium was expanded several times, eventually growing to hold 17,925, and sold out every game; amazingly, it never rained on a Sounders game in this outdoor facility. On the field, the Sounders were one of the league's better teams, posting a 15\u20137 record and making their first playoff appearance at Portland; their 2\u20131 loss in the quarterfinals cemented the [[Portland Timbers-Seattle Sounders rivalry]] which grew to become American soccer's most storied derby. Two [[indoor soccer]] exhibition games were played as a training exercise that winter as well, marking the origins of that version of the sport.\n\nThe Sounders' success helped Daggatt and his partners get the [[NFL]] [[Seattle Seahawks]] franchise, and both teams started play in the [[Kingdome]] in 1976. The first sporting event held at the Kingdome was a Sounders match against the Cosmos on April 9; 58,128 fans packed the Kingdome that day to investigate the new building and get a look at Pele, who scored two goals to lead the Cosmos to a 3\u20131 victory. Important player signings included former English [[World Cup 1966]] star [[Geoff Hurst]] and goalkeeper [[Tony Chursky]] who would lead the league with a 0.91 goals against average. The Sounders also led the NASL in attendance in 1976 with 23,826 fans per match,<ref name=\"homepages.sover.net\">{{cite web|url=http://homepages.sover.net/~spectrum/year/1976.html|title=The Year in American Soccer - 1976|website=homepages.sover.net|access-date=January 18, 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150107061400/http://homepages.sover.net/~spectrum/year/1976.html|archive-date=January 7, 2015|url-status=dead}}</ref> and the team held its first home playoff game, a 2\u20131 victory over the rival [[Vancouver Whitecaps]], reaching the Divisional Championships of the [[1976 North American Soccer League season#Playoffs|1976 NASL playoffs]] before falling short on the road to the [[Minnesota Kicks]] 3\u20130.<ref name=\"homepages.sover.net\"/> The Kicks then returned to the Kingdome for [[Soccer Bowl '76]], where they lost before an unsupportive Seattle crowd of 25000 to the [[Toronto Metros-Croatia]].\n\nJimmy Gabriel assumed the coaching duties from John Best in the 1977 season. The club started slowly, losing 7 of their first 11 games; but a 10-5 tear placed them at 14-12 for the season, and fans continued to come out in large numbers, in part to see the team's first homegrown star, Seattle native and 1977 NASL Rookie of the Year [[Jimmy McAlister]]. Upsetting the favored [[L.A. Aztecs]] on the road in the conference final, they then edged them at home 1-0 before 56,000 fans, winning the Pacific Conference Championship and making it to their first ever championship game.

Longtime NASL All-Star player [[John Best (soccer)|John Best]] was hired as coach and recruited former Everton star [[Jimmy Gabriel]], 1969 NASL MVP [[Pepe Fernandez]], Crewe defender [[Dave Gillett]] and Hartlepool goalkeeper [[Barry Watling]], among others.<ref name=\"sounderatheart.com\"/>\n\nOn January 22, 1974, the team was christened Seattle Sounders, the moniker having won a highly publicized \"name the team\" contest ([[Seattle Mariners]], the eventual name of the city's second baseball team, was a runner-up). The \"lads\" (so-called because the team were largely English players) were introduced to the media and the public in early Spring, announcing they would play their first home game on May 5. At the time, soccer was largely ignored by the national media, and the game was understood and played by a very small percentage of the population; but Seattle's post-war immigrants from Scandinavia and Britain had brought awareness of soccer, and a youth soccer league had started in 1966.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.washingtonyouthsoccer.org/50th_anniversary/|title=50th Anniversary - Washington Youth Soccer|website=Washington Youth Soccer}}</ref> Whether professional soccer could work in Seattle was anyone's guess.\n\nThe answer came at the club's inaugural game, when the Sounders took on the [[Denver Dynamos]] in Memorial Stadium, whose capacity of 13000 was considered ample for a sport which had never averaged more than 3000\u20135000 in other American cities. Over 12000 came to the opening match, the start of which was delayed to allow the unexpectedly large walk-up crowd to enter the stands. Longtime Seattle sportswriter [[Royal Brougham]] introduced the team to great fanfare, though he was booed when he chose to sing, \"Take Me Out to the Ballgame\", as Seattle sports fans were still embittered over the loss a few years earlier of the [[Seattle Pilots]] [[Major League Baseball]] team. It appeared Seattle was ready to embrace a different summer sport.\n\nThe Sounders won their home opener 4\u20131, and fans were hooked. By early summer, the Sounders stunned the American sports community by posting the first-ever sellout of a stadium for a soccer game, drawing 13,498 to their game against the defending champion [[Philadelphia Atoms]]. The Sounders proved successful on the field as well, with a 10\u20137\u20133 record, and Barry Watling won Goalkeeper of the Year honors with an astounding 0.80 goals against average. 36000 tickets were printed in anticipation of a home playoff game to be held in Husky Stadium. Despite their winning record, the NASL points system meant Seattle was edged out of the final playoff spot on the last day of the season, and they finished in third place in the highly competitive Western Conference that year.\n\nThe Sounders returned in 1975 with the addition of [[Tottenham Hotspur]] defender and [[UEFA Cup]] winner [[Mike England]] to anchor the defensive midfield. The success of the Sounders and other western teams led other teams to boost their lineups as well, including the signing of [[Pele]] by the [[New York Cosmos (1970\u201385)|New York Cosmos]]. Memorial Stadium was expanded several times, eventually growing to hold 17,925, and sold out every game; amazingly, it never rained on a Sounders game in this outdoor facility. On the field, the Sounders were one of the league's better teams, posting a 15\u20137 record and making their first playoff appearance at Portland; their 2\u20131 loss in the quarterfinals cemented the [[Portland Timbers-Seattle Sounders rivalry]] which grew to become American soccer's most storied derby. Two [[indoor soccer]] exhibition games were played as a training exercise that winter as well, marking the origins of that version of the sport.\n\nThe Sounders' success helped Daggatt and his partners get the [[NFL]] [[Seattle Seahawks]] franchise, and both teams started play in the [[Kingdome]] in 1976. The first sporting event held at the Kingdome was a Sounders match against the Cosmos on April 9; 58,128 fans packed the Kingdome that day to investigate the new building and get a look at Pele, who scored two goals to lead the Cosmos to a 3\u20131 victory. Important player signings included former English [[World Cup 1966]] star [[Geoff Hurst]] and goalkeeper [[Tony Chursky]] who would lead the league with a 0.91 goals against average. The Sounders also led the NASL in attendance in 1976 with 23,826 fans per match,<ref name=\"homepages.sover.net\">{{cite web|url=http://homepages.sover.net/~spectrum/year/1976.html|title=The Year in American Soccer - 1976|website=homepages.sover.net|access-date=January 18, 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150107061400/http://homepages.sover.net/~spectrum/year/1976.html|archive-date=January 7, 2015|url-status=dead}}</ref> and the team held its first home playoff game, a 2\u20131 victory over the rival [[Vancouver Whitecaps]], reaching the Divisional Championships of the [[1976 North American Soccer League season#Playoffs|1976 NASL playoffs]] before falling short on the road to the [[Minnesota Kicks]] 3\u20130.<ref name=\"homepages.sover.net\"/> The Kicks then returned to the Kingdome for [[Soccer Bowl '76]], where they lost before an unsupportive Seattle crowd of 25000 to the [[Toronto Metros-Croatia]].\n\nJimmy Gabriel assumed the coaching duties from John Best in the 1977 season. The club started slowly, losing 7 of their first 11 games; but a 10-5 tear placed them at 14-12 for the season, and fans continued to come out in large numbers, in part to see the team's first homegrown star, Seattle native and 1977 NASL Rookie of the Year [[Jimmy McAlister]]. Upsetting the favored [[L.A. Aztecs]] on the road in the conference final, they then edged them at home 1-0 before 56,000 fans, winning the Pacific Conference Championship and making it to their first ever championship game. Thousands of Seattle fans drove to Portland, the site of [[Soccer Bowl|Soccer Bowl '77]], to see them play the New York Cosmos before an international audience in what was to be Pele's last game.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://soundercentral.com/museum/1977updates/Soccer+Bowl+1977/soccer_bowl_1977.htm|title=soundercentral.com|website=soundercentral.com}}</ref>\n\n==F.C.

Although the team had started the season 1\u20133\u20134, they went on to claim the Commissioner's Cup for the league's best regular season record. The team also had a 15-game unbeaten run that included MLS opponents in the [[2007 Lamar Hunt U.S. Open Cup|U.S. Open Cup]].

The [[University of Havana]] was founded in 1727 and there are a number of other well-established [[List of universities in Cuba|colleges and universities]]. Following the 1959 revolution, the Castro regime nationalized all educational institutions, and created a system operated entirely by the government. Education expenditures continue to receive high priority.<ref name = \"LiteracyC\">[https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/latin-lessons-what-can-we-learn-from-the-worldrsquos-most-ambitious-literacy-campaign-2124433.html Latin lessons: What can we Learn from the World\u2019s most Ambitious Literacy Campaign?] by Nina Lakhani, ''[[The Independent]]'', 7 November 2010</ref>\n\n==History==\nCuba was colonized by [[Spanish Empire|Spain]] from the early 16th century until 1898, when the island was ceded to the United States following the [[Spanish\u2013American War]]. The [[University of Havana]], founded in 1727, is the oldest university in Cuba and one of the oldest in the American continent. \n\nmy pp hurts really bad and i need help pleas send help\nIn 1900 Cuba had a literacy rate of 36.1%<ref>^Torres, Carlos and A.

By the early 1900s Cuba had a strong education system, but it was only attended by half of the country\u2019s children. Schools were not accessible to the poorest Cubans and this resulted in a low literacy rate for rural areas compared to the cities. Before 1959, of the Cubans over the age of 15 years, 22% were found to be illiterate and 60% of the country was found to be semi-illiterate because many rural Cubans had a third-grade education or less.<ref>^ \"Education in Pre-revolutionary Cuba\". ''Census of the Republic of Cuba'', 1953.</ref> \n\nPublic Education in Cuba has always been free.{{citation needed|date=July 2019}} After passing the required entrance examination to your particular course of study, even attendance at the University of Havana was tuition free, except for the cost of books.{{citation needed|date=July 2019}} After the [[Cuban Revolution]], the new government placed the reconstruction of the education system along Marxist ideological lines as a top priority. Five key objectives were devised and used to frame Cuba's educational system. Many children who lived in distant rural areas were now able to acquire an education provided them by visiting teachers.\n\nFollowing the basic restructuring and reopening of Cuban schools, the new government focused on the huge literacy problem. By April 1959, 817 literacy centers were opened<ref>^Britton, John A. \"Part Five,\" ''Molding Hearts and Minds''. Delaware: Wilmington, 1994: 168.</ref> and, to further reach out to all, teens and other volunteers were sent out to the countryside to teach their fellow Cubans how to read. The [[Cuban Literacy Campaign|Literacy Campaign]] served two purposes: \n\n- to educate every Cuban and teach them to read, \n\n- to give those who live in the city a chance to experience rural living. \n\nIn a short time Cuba\u2019s new government made vast changes to the education system, and by 2000, 97%<ref>^ \"Education\". UNICEF, 2007.</ref> of Cubans ages 15\u201324 were literate. Literacy provided poor uneducated Cubans a better standing in the country and the world. Education was vital to the new government. The leaders believed that for Cuba to be strong and for citizens to be active participants in society, they must be educated.\n\nPrivate universities were nationalised by force, along with private schools, in 1961.\n\n===Female participation===\nThe [[Cuban Revolution]] in 1959 brought lots of changes to the country, especially for women. Before the Revolution many women lived as housewives and for those who needed to work there were very few choices.<ref>^ Evenson, Debra. \"Women's Equality in Cuba: What Difference Does a Revolution Make\". ''Law & Inequality: A Journal of Theory and Practice''. University of Minnesota Libraries Publishing, 1986: 295.</ref>  Many women in rural areas worked in agriculture and for women in the city working as a maid or prostitute were the only choices. The [[Federation of Cuban Women]] (FMC) was founded in August 1960 with a clear goal to involve all women in Cuban affairs. After years of being excluded, the women of Cuba began to play an active role in the government. The [[Federation of Cuban Women|FMC]] wanted to see women involved with the social, political, economical and cultural issues Cuba faced.<ref>^ \"Federation of Cuban Women\". Cuba, 2010.</ref> This required that schools and programs be built to provide multiple services to Cuban women.\n\nThe [[Cuban Literacy Campaign|Literacy Campaign]] was created to increase Cuba\u2019s literacy rate and to initiate communication between the countryside and cities.<ref>^Thrupkaew, Noy. \"Cuba: Cuban Women, Beyond Prostitution\". ''Green Left Weekly'' #461 (2001).</ref> Students and volunteers went to rural areas to teach people to read and provide information on current Cuban politics. Rural women received schooling and job training if they chose to receive it, which allowed them to work outside of agriculture. For women working as prostitutes in the cities the new government created programs to reeducate them once [[prostitution in Cuba]] was suppressed in 1961. Separate but similar programs were created for maids, offering schooling and job training along with free daycare and housing, which allowed the women full opportunity to rebuild their lives. Healthcare was provided focusing on the mental health of Cuban women that had previously been oppressed in the work place.<ref>^ Lewis, Oscar & Ruth. \"The 'Rehabilitation' of Prostitutes\". ''The Cuban Reader''. Duke University Press, 2004: 395.</ref> Skills to build confidence and pride were taught because the new government believed that all women deserved dignity. The [[Cuban Revolution]] brought about drastic change for women allowing them to become very active in their own country, which is what many in the revolution hoped for.{{citation needed|date=March 2011}}\n\n==Level of achievement==\nA 1998 study by [[UNESCO]] reported that Cuban students showed a high level of educational achievement. Cuban third and fourth graders scored 350 points, 100 points above the regional average in tests of basic language and mathematics skills. The report indicated that the test achievement of the lower half of students in Cuba was significantly higher than the test achievement of the upper half of students in other Central and South American countries in the study group.<ref>[http://fcis.oise.utoronto.ca/~daniel_schugurensky/assignment1/1998cuba.html UNESCO report ranks Cuban students first in international math and reading tests] 1998</ref><ref>[http://www.imf.org/external/pubs/ft/fandd/2005/06/cohen.htm Cultivating Minds] Joel E.

By the early 1900s Cuba had a strong education system, but it was only attended by half of the country\u2019s children. Schools were not accessible to the poorest Cubans and this resulted in a low literacy rate for rural areas compared to the cities. Before 1959, of the Cubans over the age of 15 years, 22% were found to be illiterate and 60% of the country was found to be semi-illiterate because many rural Cubans had a third-grade education or less.<ref>^ \"Education in Pre-revolutionary Cuba\".

{"title_page": "Succession to the French throne", "text_new": "{{multiple issues|\n{{POV|date=April 2015}}\n{{refimprove|date=February 2012}}\n}}\n\nThis article covers the mechanism by which the French throne passed from the establishment of the Frankish Kingdom in 486 to the fall of the Second French Empire in 1870.\n\n==Merovingian dynasty==\n[[File:Frankish Empire 481 to 814-en.svg|thumb|300px|Austrasia, homeland of the Franks (darkest green), and subsequent conquests (other shades of green).]]\nThe [[Merovingian dynasty|Merovingians]] were a [[Salian Franks|Salian Frankish]] dynasty that came to rule the [[Franks]] in a region (known as Francia in Latin) largely corresponding to ancient [[Gaul]] from the middle of the 5th century.\n\n[[Clovis I]] was the first Germanic ruler to convert to [[Roman Catholicism]]. The Franks began to adopt [[Christianity]] following the baptism of Clovis, an event that inaugurated the alliance between the Frankish kingdom and the Roman Catholic Church. Even so, the Merovingian kings were largely beyond the control of the [[Pope]]. Because they were able to worship with their Catholic neighbors, the newly-Christianized Franks found much easier acceptance from the local Gallo-Roman population than did the [[Arianism|Arian]] [[Visigoths]], [[Vandals]] or [[Burgundians]]. The Merovingians thus built what eventually proved the most stable of the successor-kingdoms in the west.\n\nFollowing Frankish custom, the kingdom was partitioned among Clovis' four sons, and over the next century this tradition of partition continued. Even when several Merovingian kings simultaneously ruled their own realms, the kingdom \u2014 not unlike the late [[Roman Empire]] \u2014 was conceived of as a single entity. Externally, the kingdom, even when divided under different kings, maintained unity and conquered Burgundy in 534. After the fall of the [[Ostrogoths]], the Franks also conquered [[Provence]]. Internally, the kingdom was divided among Clovis' sons and later among his grandsons which frequently saw war between the different kings, who allied among themselves and against one another. The death of one king created conflict between the surviving brothers and the deceased's sons, with differing outcomes. Due to frequent warfare, the kingdom was occasionally united under one king. Although this prevented the kingdom from being fragmented into numerous parts, this practice weakened royal power, for they had to make concessions to the nobility to procure their support in war.\n\nIn each Frankish kingdom the [[Mayor of the Palace]] served as the chief officer of state. From about the turn of the eighth century, the [[Austrasia]]n Mayors tended to wield the real power in the kingdom, laying the foundation for a new dynasty.\n\n==Carolingian dynasty==\nThe Carolingians consolidated their power in the late seventh century, eventually making the offices of mayor of the palace and ''dux et princeps Francorum'' hereditary and becoming the ''de facto'' rulers of the Franks as the real powers behind the throne.\n\nTo legalize the power already being exercised by the mayors of the palace, Pepin requested and received from the pope a decision that whoever exercised the actual power in the kingdom should be the legal ruler. After this decision the throne was declared vacant. Childeric III was deposed and confined to a monastery.\n\nAccording to ancient custom, Pepin was then elected King of the Franks by an assembly of Frankish nobles, with a large portion of his army on hand (in case the nobility inclined not to honor the Papal bull). Although such elections happened infrequently, a general rule in Germanic law stated that the king relied on the support of his leading men. These men reserved the right to choose a new leader if they felt that the old one could not lead them in profitable battle. While in later France the kingdom became hereditary, the kings of the later Holy Roman Empire proved unable to abolish the elective tradition and continued as elected rulers until the Empire's formal end in 1806. In 754 the pope reaffirmed the election of Pepin by crossing the Alps and personally anointing the new king in the Old Testament manner, as the Chosen of the Lord.\n\nBehind the pope's action lay his need for a powerful protector. In 751 the Lombards had conquered the Exarchate of Ravenna, the center of Byzantine government in Italy, were demanding tribute from the pope, and threatened to besiege Rome. Following Pepin's coronation, the pope secured the new ruler's promise of armed intervention in Italy and his pledge to give the papacy the Exarchate of Ravenna, once it was conquered. In 756 a Frankish army forced the Lombard king to relinquish his conquests, and Pepin officially gave Ravenna to the pope. Known as the \"Donation of Pepin,\" the gift made the pope a temporal ruler over the Papal States, a strip of territory that extended diagonally\nacross northern Italy.\n\nThe greatest Carolingian monarch was Charlemagne, who was crowned Emperor by Pope Leo III at Rome in 800. His empire, ostensibly a continuation of the Roman Empire, is referred to historiographically as the Carolingian Empire.\n\nThe Carolingians followed the Frankish custom of dividing inheritances among the surviving sons, though the concept of the indivisibility of the Empire was also accepted. The Carolingians had the practice of making their sons (sub-)kings in the various regions (regna) of the Empire, which they would inherit on the death of their father. Though the Carolingian Empire may have several kings, the imperial dignity was accorded only to the oldest son.\n\nCharlemagne had three legitimate sons who survived infancy: [[Charles the Younger, son of Charlemagne|Charles the Younger]], [[King of Neustria]], [[Pepin of Italy|Pepin]], [[King of Italy]], and [[Louis the Pious|Louis]], [[King of Aquitaine]]. In the ''Divisio Regnorum'' of 806, Charlemagne had slated Charles the Younger as his successor as emperor and chief king, ruling over the Frankish heartland of [[Neustria]] and [[Austrasia]], while giving Pepin the [[Iron Crown of Lombardy]], which Charlemagne possessed by conquest. To Louis's kingdom of Aquitaine, he added [[Septimania]], [[Provence]], and part of [[Burgundy (region)|Burgundy]]. But Charlemagne's other legitimate sons died \u2013 Pepin in 810 and Charles in 811 \u2013 and Louis alone remained to be crowned co-emperor with Charlemagne in 813. Pepin, King of Italy, left behind a son, [[Bernard of Italy|Bernard]]. On the death of Charlemagne in 814, Louis inherited the entire Frankish kingdom and all its possessions (the concept of successional representation was not yet well-established). But Bernard was allowed to retain control of Italy, the sub-kingdom of his father.\n\nFollowing the death of [[Louis the Pious]], the surviving adult Carolingians fought a three-year civil war ending only in the [[Treaty of Verdun]], which divided the empire into three regna while imperial status and a nominal lordship was accorded to Lothair I.\n\nThe Carolingians differed markedly from the Merovingians in that they disallowed inheritance to illegitimate offspring, possibly in an effort to prevent infighting among heirs and assure a limit to the division of the realm. In the late ninth century, however, the lack of suitable adults among the Carolingians necessitated the rise of [[Arnulf of Carinthia]], a bastard child of a legitimate Carolingian king.\n\nThe Carolingians were displaced in most of the regna of the Empire in 888. They ruled on in [[East Francia]] until 911 and they held the throne of [[West Francia]] intermittently until 987. Though they asserted their prerogative to rule, their hereditary, God-given right, and their usual alliance with the Church, they were unable to stem the principle of electoral monarchy and their propagandism failed them in the long run. Carolingian cadet branches continued to rule in Vermandois and Lower Lorraine after the last king died in 987, but they never sought thrones of principalities and made peace with the new ruling families.\n\n==Capetian dynasty==\n\n===The election of Hugh Capet===\nFrom 977 to 986, [[Hugh Capet]], son of [[Hugh the Great]], Duke of the Franks, allied himself with the German emperors Otto II and Otto III and with Archbishop [[Adalberon, Archbishop of Reims|Adalberon of Reims]] to dominate the Carolingian king, Lothair. By 986, he was king in all but name. After Lothair's son [[Louis V of France|Louis V]] died in May 987, Adalberon and Gerbert of Aurillac convened an assembly of nobles to elect Hugh Capet as their king.\n\nImmediately after his coronation, Hugh began to push for the coronation of his son [[Robert II of France|Robert]]. Hugh's own claimed reason was that he was planning an expedition against the Moorish armies harassing [[Borrel II of Barcelona]], an invasion which never occurred, and that the stability of the country necessitated two kings should he die while on expedition. Ralph Glaber, however, attributes Hugh's request to his old age and inability to control the nobility. Modern scholarship has largely imputed to Hugh the motive of establishing a dynasty against the claims of electoral power on the part of the aristocracy, but this is not the typical view of his contemporaries and even some modern scholars have been less skeptical of Hugh's \"plan\" to campaign in Spain. Robert was eventually crowned on 25 December 987. A measure of Hugh's success is that when he died in 996, Robert continued to reign without anyone disputing his rights, but during his long reign actual royal power dissipated into the hands of the great territorial magnates.\n\nThus, the early Capetians made their position ''de facto'' hereditary by associating their eldest sons to the kingship while they still live. By the death of [[Philip I of France|Philip I]], this hereditary feature had become established in custom. Even though Philip refused to have his son crowned during his lifetime, Louis succeeded with little trouble. Yet the association of the eldest son to the kingship continued for two more generations, with [[Philip II of France|Philip II Augustus]] being the last king so crowned.\n\n===The succession in 1031===\nHenry I became sole ruler on his father's death in 1031. The succession, however, was hotly contested by his younger brother [[Robert I, Duke of Burgundy|Robert]]. [[Constance of Arles]], Henry's mother, preferred to place her younger son, Robert, on the throne. She allied herself with one of the more powerful counts of the time, [[Odo II, Count of Blois]].\n\nThis alliance was particularly worrisome for Henry I. Odo II of Blois was a very powerful lord and had warred against Henry's father throughout his reign; he had enlarged his possessions to the point of encircling the royal demesne. With his alliance, the queen mother and her son Robert managed to expel King Henry from his own demesne lands, forcing him to seek refuge at the court of the duke of Normandy, [[Robert I, Duke of Normandy|Robert]].\n\nKing Henry formed an alliance with the powerful duke of Normandy, Robert, by granting him the French Vexin, or the lands between the rivers Epte and Oise. Although this has been debated by modern scholarship, the fact remains that Robert fought alongside the king. Henry also managed to gain the alliance of another powerful count, [[Baldwin IV of Flanders]].\n\nFinally, Henry added [[Emperor Henry II]] to his camp. The emperor had personal issues with Odo II. He wished nothing more than to rid himself of a powerful foe and troublesome neighbour. Odo had invaded Henry's lands in Burgundy and took many castles and places. Henry and his allies recovered the royal lands that had been lost to the usurpers. The conflict didn't end there; there was still a chance for Robert to win the throne. Henry, to guarantee his brother's submission, granted him the vast duchy of Burgundy, which had been added to the royal demesne by Robert II.\n\nOdo found himself in Imperial Burgundy against Henry II. At the battle of Bar-le-Duc, Odo was killed in battle in the year 1037. His lands and properties were divided amongst his sons, ending a threat against the Capetian monarchy.\n\nHenry I had managed to maintain his royal title and dignity, but the price was great. The greatest problem to have arisen from the crisis was the growth in independence of the lords and castellans in the lands of the royal demesne. This had the effect of weakening royal authority even further. Secondly, Henry I lost a great deal of territory and land in suppressing the revolt. The French Vexin was granted away to the duke of Normandy, the duchy of Burgundy, a substantial part of the royal demesne, was given away to Robert, the king's younger brother.\n\n====The appanage system====\nAn [[appanage]] is a fief conceded to a younger son or a younger brother of the king. In France, the origin of the appanage can be found either in the old Frankish custom of dividing the inheritance between the sons (a custom which feudalism replaced with the ''partage noble'' in which the eldest son received most of the estates); or in the fact that, at its origins, the Capetian monarchy was relatively weak, and the principle of succession by the eldest son was not secure until the late 12th century.\n\nThe first such appanage in the history of the Capetian monarchy was the duchy of Burgundy, which Henry I ceded to his younger brother Robert. Later, Louis VII gave Dreux to his son Robert, in 1137, Philip Augustus gave Domfront and Mortain to his younger son Philip Hurepel (who had also become count of Boulogne by marriage). The last two cases were not under the same kind of duress, but probably reflect the same desire to ward off quarrels.\n\nThe original appanages, just like other feudal fiefs, could pass through the female line. As the monarchy became more powerful, they began to restrict the transmission of appanages in the male line, although this did not become standard for some time. The greatest example is the [[Duchy of Burgundy]], which may have been illegally confiscated by [[Louis XI of France|Louis XI]] after the death of the last male duke. After Burgundy, the restriction to male heirs became standard (it is mentioned in an ordinance of Charles V in 1374), but was not formalized until the Edict of Moulins in 1566.<ref>{{cite web|author=Fran\u00e7ois Velde |url= http://www.heraldica.org/topics/france/apanage.htm |title=Apanages in the French Monarchy |publisher=Heraldica.org |date=2010-04-22 |accessdate=2014-09-23}}</ref>\n\nThe Capetians also conceded fiefs to daughters or sisters in the form of [[dowry]], although this practice became less and less common over time.\n\n===The end of the \"[[Capetian Miracle|Capetian miracle]]\"===\nThe [[Salic Law]] (Lex Salica) is a code of law written around the time of [[Clovis I]] for the [[Salian Franks]], in Latin mixed with Germanic words. It deals mainly with monetary compensations (wehrgeld) and also with civil law with respect to men and land. Clause 6 in title 59, which deals with inheritance rules for allodial lands (i.e. family lands not held in benefice) specifies that in \"concerning salic lands (terra Salica) no portion or inheritance is for a woman but all the land belongs to members of the male sex who are brothers.\" A capitulary of Chilperic, ca. 575, expands this by admitting inheritance by a daughter in the absence of sons: \"if a man had neighbors but after his death sons and daughters remained, as long as there were sons they should have the land just as the Salic Law provides. And if the sons are already dead then a daughter may receive the land just as the sons would have done had they lived.\" The monarchy is nowhere mentioned. The Salic Law was reformulated under Charlemagne and still applied in the 9th century, but it slowly disappeared as it became incorporated into local common laws. By the 14th century it was completely forgotten.<ref>{{cite web|author=Fran\u00e7ois Velde|url=http://www.heraldica.org/topics/france/salic.htm |title=The Salic Law |publisher=Heraldica.org |date=2005-01-13 |accessdate=2012-02-18}}</ref>\n\nFrom 987 to 1316, every king of France was fortunate to have a son to succeed him. This state of affairs lasted over three hundred years, spanning 13 generations. The Capetians did not even have to deal with the question of successional representation; Hugh Magnus, eldest son of Robert II, and Philip, eldest son of Louis VI, did not leave behind children of their own when they predeceased their respective fathers. Thus, for such a long time, the succession to the throne was undisputed, so that there was no reason for the peers of the realm to elect a new king. Since 987, the Capetians had always passed the crown to their eldest surviving son, and this birthright became itself a source of unquestionable legitimacy. Louis VIII was the last king acclaimed before the sacred unction (last remnant of the original election). From St. Louis, in 1226, King was acclaimed after the anointing. The voice of the barons was no longer necessary in determining the king.\n\n[[Philip IV of France|Philip the Fair]] was not concerned about the lack of male heirs. He had three sons, well married, and a daughter, [[Isabella of France]], Queen of England by her marriage to Edward II of England. The eldest son, [[Louis X of France|Louis the Quarrelsome]], was King of Navarre and Count of Champagne since the death of his mother. He would, at the death of his father, become King of France and Navarre. His wife, [[Margaret of Burgundy, Queen of France|Margaret of Burgundy]] had given him a daughter, but she was young and he could expect her to give him a son later. As for his two other sons, [[Philip V of France|Philip, Count of Poitiers]] and [[Charles IV of France|Charles, Count of La Marche]], they had married the two daughters of [[Otto IV, Count of Burgundy]] and [[Mahaut, Countess of Artois]], [[Joan II, Countess of Burgundy|Joan]] and [[Blanche of Burgundy|Blanche]]. The king could believe his succession was assured.\n\nEverything collapsed in the spring of 1314, when the affairs of the daughters-in-law of the king were discovered (also known as the [[Tour de Nesle Affair]]). Somewhat neglected by their husbands, the princesses entertained themselves without them. The lover of Margaret of Burgundy was a young knight named Gauthier d'Aunay. Gautier's brother, Philippe d'Aunay, was meanwhile Blanche's lover. Without participating in the adventures of her sister and her sister-in-law, Joan knew everything and kept silent. Royal reaction was brutal. The Aunay brothers were tried and executed summarily; Margaret of Burgundy died of cold in the tower of Chateau Gaillard; Blanche of Burgundy was imprisoned for ten years before ending her days in Maubuisson Abbey, near Pontoise.\n\nThe dynastic succession was jeopardized. Margaret's death would allow Louis to remarry. But for the summer of 1314, the future king of France had no wife and no son. He only had a daughter, Joan, who could not be denied the inheritance of Navarre (which allowed female inheritance). This girl was suspected of illegitimacy, because of her mother's adultery with Gauthier d'Aunay, which could be dangerous for the crown of France, given the risk of particularly serious political crises because of suspicions of illegitimacy. Any rebellious vassal, to legitimize his rebellion, could accuse the future queen of bastardy.\n\nLouis X died on June 5, 1316, having just had time to marry again, after a reign of eighteen months, leaving his new wife [[Clementia of Hungary]] pregnant. Philip of Poitiers was at Lyon at the day of the death of his brother. The prince took the regency of both France and Navarre. Joan's claim was supported by her maternal grandmother, [[Agnes of France (1260-1327)|Agnes of France]], and her uncle, [[Odo IV, Duke of Burgundy]]. The arguments they invoked in favor of Joan were in full conformity with feudal law which has always authorized a daughter to succeed to the fief in the absence of sons. Indeed, female succession was a reality in France. Aquitaine had been ruled by a duchess, Eleanor, and countesses had ruled Toulouse and Champagne, as well as in Flanders and Artois. Mahaut, Countess of Artois, belonged to the Court of Peers since 1302. Outside the realm, women have played a role in the devolution of the English crown as well as the crown of the Latin Kingdom of Jerusalem. And [[Joan I of Navarre]] had brought her kingdom of Navarre to her husband Philip the Fair. The idea that a woman would become queen of France was in itself nothing shocking to the barons. Indeed, at the death of [[Louis VIII of France|Louis VIII]], the kingdom was governed by a woman \u2014 [[Blanche of Castile]] \u2014 regent in the name of her young son [[Louis IX of France|Louis IX]].\n\nThe regent made a treaty with the Duke of Burgundy. It was agreed that if Queen Clementia of Hungary gave birth to a son, Philip will maintain the regency until his nephew's majority. In the event that the queen gave birth to a daughter, Philip undertook to renounce Navarre and Champagne in favor of the princesses, if they renounced the crown of France at the age of consent. If not, their claim was to remain, and \"right was to be done to them therein\"; but Philip would no longer renounce Navarre and Champagne.\n\nOn November 15, 1316, Queen Clementia gave birth to a son, [[John I the Posthumous|John the Posthumous]]. Unfortunately, the child lived only five days, and the kingdom remained without a direct heir. By his treaty with the Duke of Burgundy, Philip would only rule the two kingdoms as regent or governor, until Joan reached the age of consent. But Philip had himself crowned at Rheims, on January 9, 1317. Opposed by the Duke of Burgundy, and his own brother, Charles, Count of La Marche, it was thought prudent to shut the gates of the town during the ceremony. Back at Paris, an assembly of prelates, barons and burgesses acknowledged Philip as their sovereign, and asserted that \"women do not succeed to the French throne.\"\n\nThe Duke of Burgundy championed his niece's rights. Philip won him over by giving him his daughter, [[Joan III, Countess of Burgundy|Joan of France]], with the promise of the counties of Artois and Burgundy. The princess Joan, daughter of Louis X, was given an annuity of 15,000 pounds. In return, Joan of Navarre must, at her twelfth year, ratify the treaty which disinherited her, not only of her claim to France, but also of her unquestionable right to Navarre and Champagne.\n\nIn 1322, Philip V the Tall died after a reign of six years. He left only daughters. Thus, his younger brother, Charles of La Marche, would become king under the name of Charles IV the Fair. Despite two successive marriages with [[Marie of Luxembourg, Queen of France|Marie of Luxembourg]] and [[Jeanne d'\u00c9vreux|Joan of \u00c9vreux]], Charles the Fair, as his brother Philip the Tall, left only daughters when he died in 1328. Thus, in less than fourteen years, the three sons of Philip the Fair, Louis X the Quarrelsome, Philip V the Tall and Charles IV the Fair, had died.\n\nHowever, like his brother Louis X, Charles IV the Fair left his wife pregnant. Before dying, the youngest son of Philip the Fair designated as regent his cousin, [[Philip VI of France|Philip of Valois]]. He was the eldest son of Charles of Valois, brother of Philip the Fair. A few months later, Queen Joan of \u00c9vreux gave birth to a daughter, [[Blanche of France, Duchess of Orl\u00e9ans|Blanche]]. Philip of Valois, a grown man and prominent lord, had no trouble being proclaimed king by another assembly of lords and prelates in Vincennes and crowned on May 29, 1328.\n\n===The succession in 1328===\n\nKing Charles IV was no longer. He had no male descendants. He was the youngest son of Philip the Fair. The situation in 1328 was unlike that of 1316. In 1316, a king's son was competing with a brother and a younger child. In 1328, Philip of Valois was not the closest in the line, or the more direct, because the last Capetians girls left now had husbands. But the Count of Valois was the closest male relative in the male line, and he was 35 years old. He was the eldest male of the family.\n\n{{chart top|width=100%|The French royal family in 1328}}\n{{chart/start|align=center}}\n{{chart | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | AAA | |AAA='''''[[Philip III of France]] \"the Bold\"'''''<br>[[File:Arms of the Kings of France (France Ancien).svg|25px]]  r. 1270-1285}}\n{{chart | | | | | | | | | |,|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|^|-|-|-|-|-|v|-|-|-|.| | | }}\n{{chart | | | | | | | | | AAA | | | | | | | | | | | | FFF | | GGG | |AAA='''''[[Philip IV of France|Philip IV of France and Navarre ]] \"the Fair\"'''''<br/>[[File:Blason Le Palais 56.svg|25px]]  r. 1285-1314|FFF=''[[Charles of Valois|Charles of France]]<br>[[File:Blason comte fr Valois.svg|25px]]''  Count of Valois <br/>d. 1325|GGG=''[[Louis, Count of \u00c9vreux|Louis of France]]''<br>[[File:Blason ville fr Mortain (Manche).svg|25px]]  Count of \u00c9vreux<br/>d. 1319}}\n{{chart | | | |,|-|-|-|v|-|^|-|v|-|-|-|.| | | | | | | |!| | | |!| | | }}\n{{chart | | | AAA | | BBB | | CCC | | DDD |y| EEE | | FFF | | |!| | |AAA='''''[[Louis X of France]] \"the Stubborn\"'''''<br>[[File:Blason Le Palais 56.svg|25px]]  r. 1314-1316|BBB='''''[[Philip V of France]] \"the Tall\"'''''<br>[[File:Blason Le Palais 56.svg|25px]]  r. 1316-1322|CCC='''''[[Charles IV of France]] \"the Fair\"'''''<br>[[File:Blason Le Palais 56.svg|25px]]  r. 1322-1328|DDD=[[Isabella of France]]<br/>[[File:Arms of Isabella of France.svg|25px]]|EEE=''[[Edward II of England]]''<br/>[[File:Royal Arms of England (1198-1340).svg|25px]]|FFF= '''[[Philip VI of France|Philip of Valois]]'''<br>[[File:Blason comte fr Valois.svg|25px]] count of Valois [[File:Arms of the Kings of France (France Ancien).svg|25px]]<br />b. 1293}}\n{{chart | |,|-|^|-|.| | |!| | | | | | | | |!| | | | | | | | | |!|}}\n{{chart | JoI | | JII | | BBB | | | | | | EEE | | | | | | | | PhE | |JoI='''''[[John I of France]] \"the Posthumous\"'''''<br>[[File:Arms of the Kings of France (France Ancien).svg|25px]]  r. 1316|JII=[[Joan II of Navarre|Joan of France]], Queen of Navarre<br>[[File:Arms of Navarre-Coat of Arms of Spain Template.svg|25px]]  b. 1312|BBB=[[Joan III, Countess of Burgundy]]<br>[[File:Arms of County of Burgundy.svg|25px]]  b. 1308|EEE=[[Edward III of England]]<br>[[File:Royal Arms of England (1340-1367).svg|25px]]  b. 1312|PhE=[[Philip III of Navarre|Philip of \u00c9vreux]]<br>King of Navarre as Philip{{nbsp}}III<br/>[[File:COA Navarre Evreux Philippe III d'Evreux.svg|25px]]  b. 1306}}\n{{chart | | | | | |L|y|~|~| |!| |~|~|~|~|~|~|~|~|~|~|~|~|~|~|~|J| | }}\n{{chart | | | | | | CLM | | PoB | |CLM=[[Charles II of Navarre|Charles II of \u00c9vreux]]<br/>[[File:Royal Arms of Navarre (1328-1425).svg|25px]]  King of Navarre <br/>b.1332|PoB=[[Philip II, Count of Auvergne|Philip of Burgundy]]<br>[[File:Armes Philippe Monsieur de Bourgogne.svg|25px]]  b. 1323}}\n{{chart/end}}\n|-\n|style=\"text-align: left;\"|'''Notes:'''\n{{notelist-lr}}<!--- use either {{Efn-lr}} and/or <ref group=lower-roman /> To fill this notelist -->\n{{chart bottom}}\n\n====The contenders for the throne====\n\n* [[Philip VI of France|Philip, Count of Valois]], nephew of Philip IV, cousin of the last three kings, regent of the kingdom by the wish of Charles the Fair. He was in a strong position: he was popular with the nobility and supported by influential figures such as [[Robert III of Artois|Robert of Artois]]. In the male line, he was closest to the scepter.\n* [[Philip III of Navarre|Philip, Count of \u00c9vreux]], also a nephew of Philip the Fair, (he was the son of Louis of \u00c9vreux, younger half-brother of Philip IV and Charles of Valois). Philip of \u00c9vreux was also first cousin of the last three kings. Moreover, he had improved his position by marrying the daughter of Louis X, Joan of France.\n\nWhile the peers of France deliberated which of these two powerful lords would ascend the throne, a letter arrived from across the Channel. In this letter, Isabella claimed the crown of France for her young son Edward III, King of England, and he would be regarded as the third contender:\n\n* [[Edward III of England|Edward III]], King of England and Duke of Guyenne: grandson of Philip IV by his mother, Isabella, sister to Louis X, Philip V and Charles IV. He was the nephew of the last three kings of France. In 1328, he was only 16 years and is still under the tutelage of his mother.\n\nThe peers and the lawyers were studying this question: can Isabella of France transmit a right she did not have? Can her son Edward claim the crown of the Capetians?\n\nIsabella of France had a horrible reputation. Nicknamed the \"She-Wolf of France\", she joined the English nobles against her husband, King Edward II, who was defeated and captured. After putting her husband to death, she displayed herself in public with her lover, the regicide Roger Mortimer. All of this was well known in France. Also, her son Edward III belonged to the [[House of Plantagenet]], a dynasty that had long been in conflict with the French crown.\n\nBut Isabella's reasoning was flawed by a detail as it were negligible: if, as a woman, Isabella could transfer that right to the crown although she cannot have it for herself, then by primogeniture the true heir would have been [[Philip II, Count of Auvergne|Philip of Burgundy]], a grandson of Philip V of France. Isabella of France may have simply forgotten that her brothers had left daughters of their own.\n\nHowever, no one thought of nominating one of the daughters of three kings; to do so would recognize the right of women to the throne, and would be de facto considering the reigns of Philip V the Tall and Charles IV the Fair as nothing but a theft at the expense of Joan of France, daughter Louis X the Stubborn. Nor did they nominate the young Philip of Burgundy, the senior living male heir of Philip IV.\n\nThe peers did not want to risk giving the throne to a bastard. And, instead of proposing a daughter of Philip V or Charles IV, they decided that women should be excluded from succession to avoid endless squabbles of law.\n\nThe famous Salic law was rediscovered in 1358, and used in a propaganda fight to defend the rights of Valois against the claims of the English king. Thus, whatever the legal twist, the rights of Edward III were very questionable.\n\n====The king found====\nThe day after the funeral of Charles IV of France, the great nobles convened. Valois has already taken the title of regent, and used it already, while his cousin was dying. The assembly can only bow to the facts. Having postponed for a moment the question of the legitimacy of excluding women from succession, the will to rule out the English king was stronger. Edward III was thus ousted from the competition, but there remained two claimants to the throne, Philip of Valois and Philip of \u00c9vreux.\n\nAn agreement was reached to satisfy everyone. Philip of \u00c9vreux and his wife Joan received the kingdom of Navarre and other territorial compensation in exchange for which they would recognize Philip of Valois as King of France.\n\nThe kingdom of Navarre belonged to the King of France since the marriage of Philip IV and Joan I of Navarre, Countess of Champagne and Brie. Louis X had inherited Navarre from his mother and in 1328 his daughter Joan was finally recognized as Queen of Navarre, despite the suspicions of illegitimacy (the late return was not in the least prevented Philip the Tall and Charles the Fair, who officially called themselves Kings of France and Navarre). In addition, Philip of Valois, not being himself a descendant and heir of the kings of Navarre as were his predecessors, could restore the kingdom of Navarre without regret to Joan, the rightful heir, in exchange for her giving up the crown of France. The kingdom of Navarre will not return to the kings of France until much later, when Henry of Navarre, the future Henry IV, accedes to the throne of France, thus establishing the Bourbon dynasty. Thereafter, the French kings will again bear the title \"King of France and Navarre.\"\n\nSoon after, Philip of Valois was proclaimed King of France under the name of Philip VI of France by the peers of the realm. The Valois took power following the direct Capetians.\n\n===The Hundred Years War===\n\nThe last royal election dates back to Louis VIII the Lion in 1223. The royal power was weakened and so was the legitimacy of the Count of Valois, for it was not as unassailable as that of his predecessors on the throne. They were expecting their generous gifts, great concessions from the new king. Edward III came to pay tribute to French king, hoping also for some territorial compensation. Philip VI did not understand the danger that threatened him and did nothing to protect himself.\n\nThe succession to Charles IV the Fair, decided in favor of Philip VI, was used as a pretext by Edward III to transform what would have been a feudal struggle between himself as Duke of Guyenne against the King of France, to a dynastic struggle between the [[House of Plantagenet]] and the [[House of Valois]] for control of the French throne.\n\nThe conflict, known as the [[Hundred Years War]], dragged on for decades. England won several famous military victories, but was unable to fully overcome French resistance. Yet in the aftermath of the [[Battle of Agincourt]], [[Henry V of England]], great-grandson of Edward III, became the heir to the French throne in accordance to the [[Treaty of Troyes]]. He would marry [[Catherine of Valois|Catherine]], daughter of King [[Charles VI of France]], while Charles' son, the Dauphin [[Charles VII of France|Charles]] was declared illegitimate and disinherited.\n\nYet Henry V would predecease Charles VI, and it was his infant son who would become \"King of France\". The Dauphin still had his supporters, and became Charles VII. Eventually, the tide would turn in favor of the French, and the English were driven out. The Treaty of Troyes, which had been ratified by the Estates-General of France, was never repudiated, but the military victory of Charles VII rendered its provisions moot. The Kings of England would thereby continue to call themselves \"Kings of England and France\", dropping the nominal claim to France only in 1800.\n\nThus emerged the principle of the unavailability of the crown \u2014 no person or body could divert the succession from the lawful heir. The throne would pass by the sheer force of custom, not by the testament of the king, or by any edict, decree, or treaty, or by the generosity of any person. By this principle, the French do not consider Henry VI of England as a legitimate king of France.\n\n===The succession in 1589===\n{{main|Henry IV of France's succession|French Wars of Religion}}\n\nThe House of Valois had secured the principle of agnatic succession following their victory in the Hundred Years War. When the senior line of the Valois became extinct, they were followed by the Valois-Orl\u00e9ans line descended from [[Louis I, Duke of Orl\u00e9ans]], younger brother of Charles VI, and then, by the Valois-Angoul\u00eame line descended from a younger son of Louis I.\n\n[[Henry II of France]] was succeeded by his sons, none of whom would succeed in producing a male heir. The sons of Henry II would be the last heirs male of Philip III of France. Right after them ranked the Bourbons, descended from a younger brother of Philip III.\n\nThus, with the death of [[Fran\u00e7ois, Duke of Anjou]], younger brother of King [[Henry III of France]], the heir presumptive became the Head of the House of Bourbon, [[Henry IV of France|Henry III, King of Navarre]]. Since Henry was a Protestant, most of Catholic France found him unacceptable. By the [[Treaty of Nemours]], the Catholic League attempted to disinherit the King of Navarre by recognizing [[Charles, Cardinal de Bourbon]], Navarre's uncle, as heir. Navarre had been excommunicated by [[Pope Sixtus V]].\n\nOn his deathbed, Henry III called for Henry of Navarre, and begged him, in the name of Statecraft, to become a Catholic, citing the brutal warfare that would ensue if he refused. In keeping with Salic law, he named Navarre as his heir.\n\nOn Henry III's death in 1589, the League proclaimed the Cardinal de Bourbon king, while he was still a prisoner of Henry III in the castle of Chinon. He was recognized as Charles X by the Parliament of Paris on 21 November 1589. With Henry III's death, custody of the Cardinal fell to Navarre (now Henry IV of France), the Cardinal's nephew. When the old Cardinal died in 1590, the League could not agree on a new candidate. The Catholic League had great hopes for [[Charles, Duke of Guise]], whom they considered to elect as king. However, the Duke of Guise declared his support for Henry IV of France in 1594, for which Henry paid him four million livres and made him Governor of Provence. Some supported [[Infanta Isabella Clara Eugenia of Spain]], the daughter of [[Philip II of Spain]] and [[Elisabeth of Valois|Elisabeth of France]], eldest daughter of [[Henry II of France]]. The prominence of her candidacy hurt the League, which became suspect as agents of the Spanish.\n\nFor a time, Henry IV attempted to take his kingdom by conquest. For this, he had to capture Paris, which was defended by the Catholic League and the Spanish. Despite the campaigns between 1590 and 1592, Henry IV was \"no closer to capturing Paris\". Realizing that Henry III had been right and that there was no prospect of a Protestant king succeeding in resolutely Catholic Paris, Henry agreed to convert, reputedly stating \"Paris vaut bien une messe\" (\"Paris is well worth a Mass\"). He was formally received into the Catholic Church in 1593, and was crowned at Chartres in 1594 as League members maintained control of the Cathedral of Rheims, and, skeptical of Henry's sincerity, continued to oppose him. He was finally received into Paris in March 1594, and 120 League members in the city who refused to submit were banished from the capital. Paris' capitulation encouraged the same of many other towns, while others returned to support the crown after [[Pope Clement VIII]] absolved Henry, revoking his excommunication in return for the publishing of the [[Council of Trent|Tridentine Decrees]], the restoration of Catholicism in B\u00e9arn, and appointing only Catholics to high office.\n\nWith the success of Henry IV, the principles of the French succession were kept inviolable. The kingship of Charles, Cardinal de Bourbon, as Charles X, was delegitimized, having been contrary to these principles. A new requirement to the French succession was recognized: the King of France must be Catholic. Yet since religion could be changed, it could not be the basis for permanent exclusion from the throne.\n\n===The Bourbons in Spain===\n[[Louis XIV of France|Louis XIV]], grandson of Henry IV, was the longest-reigning king in European history. Louis XIV had only one son to survive to adulthood, the Dauphin [[Louis, Grand Dauphin|Louis]]. The Dauphin, in turn, had three sons: [[Louis, Dauphin of France, Duke of Burgundy|Louis, Duke of Burgundy]], [[Philip V of Spain|Philip, Duke of Anjou]], and [[Charles, Duke of Berry (1686\u20131714)|Charles, Duke of Berry]].\n\nIn 1700, [[Charles II of Spain]] died. His heir, in accordance to cognatic primogeniture followed in Spain, would have been the Dauphin Louis. However, since the Dauphin was the heir to the French throne, and the Duke of Burgundy was in turn the Dauphin's heir, Charles II settled his succession on the Duke of Anjou in order to prevent the union of France and Spain.\n\nMost European rulers accepted Philip as King of Spain, though some only reluctantly. Louis XIV confirmed that Philip V retained his French rights despite his new Spanish position. Admittedly, he may only have been hypothesizing a theoretical eventuality and not attempting a Franco-Spanish union. However, Louis also sent troops to the Spanish Netherlands, evicting Dutch garrisons and securing Dutch recognition of Philip V. In 1701, he transferred the [[asiento]] to France, alienating English traders. He also acknowledged [[James Francis Edward Stuart|James Stuart]], James II's son, as king on the latter's death. These actions enraged Britain and the United Provinces. Consequently, with the Emperor and the petty German states, they formed another Grand Alliance, declaring war on France in 1702. French diplomacy, however, secured Bavaria, Portugal and Savoy as Franco-Spanish allies.\n\nThus, the [[War of the Spanish Succession]] began. The war, over a decade long, was concluded by the treaties of [[Treaty of Utrecht (1713)|Utrecht]] (1713) and [[First Congress of Rastatt|Rastatt]] (1714). The allies were bent on removing Philip V from the succession to the French throne; he only agreed to this after the semi-Salic law was successfully enacted in Spain.\n\nHowever, the fact remained that the Treaty of Utrecht had disregarded the French principles of succession. Indeed, taking advantage of the power vacuum caused by Louis XIV's death in 1715, Philip announced he would claim the French crown if the infant Louis XV died.<ref>{{cite web|author=Fran\u00e7ois Velde |url=http://www.heraldica.org/topics/france/sixteBP-docs.htm#LXV |title=Sixte de Bourbon-Parme: Documents |publisher=Heraldica.org |date=2004-12-31 |accessdate=2012-02-18}}</ref>\n\nThe validity of the renunciations were not debated in public until the [[French Revolution]], when the [[National Assembly (French Revolution)|National Assembly]] first addressed this issue in a three-day session beginning on 15 September 1789. After many debates, the Assembly voted on a final text of a statement defining the succession to the Crown. This read: \"The crown is hereditary from male to male, by order of primogeniture, with the absolute exclusion of women and their descendants, without prejudging the effect of renunciations\". The Spanish Ambassador, the Count of Fernan Nu\u00f1ez wrote to the Spanish Prime Minister, the Count of Floridablanca, that same date: \"All the clergy and the major part of the nobility and also of the Third Estate has pronounced for the resolution favorable to the House of Spain\u2026 by 698 votes to 265 the majority had concluded the question in a sense again most advantageous for us....\"\n\nIn 1791 the French National Assembly drew up a new, written Constitution to which the King gave his assent, and which governed France for the last year of the 18th century monarchy. For the first time it was necessary to define formally, as a matter of statutory constitutional law, the system of succession, and the titles, privileges and prerogatives of the Crown. In debating the succession to the Crown the contemporary understanding of the law of succession was publicly clarified. It rebutted the assertion by some that the claim by the Spanish line is a late construct, made to satisfy the ambitions of princes deprived of other claims. Indeed, it is evident that the issue of the rights of the Spanish line to the French crown remained an important constitutional issue.\n\nWhen the issue of the rights of the Spanish line arose, the Assembly voted to include a phrase in the article on the succession that implicitly protected their rights. That this was the purpose of the clause seems certain: hence the phrase in Title III, Chapter II, article I: \n:\"The Kingship is indivisible, and delegated hereditarily to the reigning dynasty from male to male, by order of primogeniture, with the permanent exclusion of women and their descendants. (Nothing is prejudged on the effect of renunciations in the dynasty actually reigning).\"\n\n===The end of a dynasty===\nLouis XV had ten legitimate children, but there were only two sons, only one of whom survived to adulthood, [[Louis, Dauphin of France (1729-1765)|Louis, Dauphin of France]]. This did not help dispel the concerns about the future of the dynasty; should his male line fail, the succession would be disputed by a possible war of succession between the descendants of Philip V and the [[House of Orl\u00e9ans]] descended from the younger brother of Louis XIV.\n\nThe Dauphin Louis predeceased his father but left behind three sons, [[Louis XVI of France|Louis Auguste, Duke of Berry]], [[Louis XVIII of France|Louis Stanislas, Count of Provence]] and [[Charles X of France|Charles Philippe, Count of Artois]]. The Duke of Berry succeeded his grandfather as King Louis XVI.\n\nLouis XVI would be the only French king to be executed, during the [[French Revolution]]. For the first time, the Capetian monarchy had been overthrown. The monarchy would be restored under his younger brother, the Count of Provence, who took the name Louis XVIII in consideration of the dynastic seniority of his nephew, [[Louis XVII of France|Louis]], from 1793-1795 (the child never actually reigned). Louis XVIII died childless and was succeeded by his younger brother, the Count of Artois, as Charles X.\n\nCompelled by what he felt to be a growing, manipulative radicalism in the elected government, Charles felt that his primary duty was the guarantee of order and happiness in France and its people; not in political bipartisanship and the self-interpreted rights of implacable political enemies. He issued the [[July Ordinances|Four Ordinances of Saint-Cloud]], which was intended to quell the people of France. However, the ordinances had the opposite effect of angering the French citizens. In Paris, a committee of the liberal opposition had drawn up and signed a petition in which, they asked for the ordonnances to be withdrawn; more surprising was their criticism \"not of the King, but his ministers\" \u2013 thereby disproving Charles X's conviction that his liberal opponents were enemies of his dynasty. Charles X considered the ordonnances vital to the safety and dignity of the French throne. Thus, he did not withdraw the ordonnances. This resulted in the [[July Revolution]].\n\nCharles X abdicated in favor of his 10-year-old grandson, [[Henry, Count of Chambord|Henri, Duke of Bordeaux]], (forcing his son [[Louis Antoine, Duke of Angoul\u00eame|Louis Antoine]] to renounce his rights along the way) and naming [[Louis Philippe I|Louis Philippe III, Duke of Orl\u00e9ans]] Lieutenant General of the Kingdom, charging him to announce to the popularly elected Chamber of Deputies his desire to have his grandson succeed him. Louis Philippe did not do this, in order to increase his own chances of succession. As a consequence, because the chamber was aware of Louis Philippe's liberal policies and of his popularity with the masses, they proclaimed Louis Philippe, who for eleven days had been acting as the regent for his small cousin, as the new French king, displacing the senior branch of the House of Bourbon.\n\n===The House of Orl\u00e9ans===\nThe House of Orl\u00e9ans took the throne in defiance of the principles of the Capetian monarchy, and could be viewed as a separate institution altogether.\n\nUpon his accession to the throne, Louis Philippe assumed the title of King of the French \u2013 a title already adopted by Louis XVI in the short-lived Constitution of 1791. Linking the monarchy to a people instead of a territory (as the previous designation King of France and of Navarre) was aimed at undercutting the [[legitimist]] claims of Charles X and his family.\n\nBy an ordinance he signed on 13 August 1830, the new king defined the manner in which his children, as well as his sister, would continue to bear the surname \"d'Orl\u00e9ans\" and the arms of Orl\u00e9ans, declared that his eldest son, as Prince Royal (not Dauphin), would bear the title Duke of Orl\u00e9ans, that the younger sons would continue to have their previous titles, and that his sister and daughters would only be styled Princesses of Orl\u00e9ans, not of France.\n\nThe government of Louis Philippe grew increasingly conservative over the years. After ruling for 18 years, the 1848 wave of revolutions reached France and overthrew Louis Philippe. The king abdicated in favor of his nine-year-old grandson, [[Philippe, comte de Paris|Philippe, Count of Paris]]. The National Assembly initially planned to accept young Philippe as king, but the strong current of public opinion rejected that. On 26 February, the Second Republic was proclaimed.\n\n==House of Bonaparte==\n{{main|Line of succession to the French throne (Bonapartist)}}\n\n===First French Empire===\n[[Napol\u00e9on Bonaparte]] (1769-1821) came to power by a military coup on Nov 10, 1799. The regime he put in place was headed by three Consuls, and he was the First Consul. He became Consul for Life in 1802, and then transformed the regime into a hereditary monarchy in 1804. The rules of succession as set down in the constitution are:<ref>{{cite web|author=Fran\u00e7ois Velde |url=http://www.heraldica.org/topics/royalty/nap_succ.htm |title=Napoleonic Succession Laws |publisher=Heraldica.org |date=2000-09-15 |accessdate=2012-02-18}}</ref>\n*The legitimate heir to the imperial throne should pass firstly to Napoleon I's own legitimate male descendants through the male line, excluding women and their issue. Napol\u00e9on could adopt a son or grandson (aged 18 or more) of one of his brothers, if he had no children of his own. No other adoptions were allowed.\n*In default of Napol\u00e9on's line (of the body or adoptive), the succession calls [[Joseph Bonaparte|Joseph]] and his line, followed by [[Louis Bonaparte|Louis]] and his line. His other brothers, [[Lucien Bonaparte]] and [[J\u00e9r\u00f4me Bonaparte]], and their descendants, were omitted from the succession, even though Lucien was older than Louis, because they had either politically opposed the emperor or made marriages of which he disapproved. \n*Princes were forbidden from marrying without prior consent, on pain of losing their succession rights and excluding their issue; but if the marriage ended without children, the prince would recover his rights. \n* Upon extinction of the legitimate natural and adopted males, [[patrilineality|agnatic]] descendants of Napoleon I, and those of two of his brothers, [[Joseph Bonaparte|Joseph]] and [[Louis Bonaparte|Louis]], the Grand Dignitaries of the Empire (non-dynastic princely and ducal houses) would submit a proposal to the Senate, to be approved by referendum, choosing a new emperor.\n\nAt the time the law of succession was decreed Napoleon I had no legitimate sons, and it seemed unlikely he would have any due to the age of his wife, [[Jos\u00e9phine de Beauharnais|Josephine of Beauharnais]]. His eventual response was an unacceptable one, in the eyes of Catholic France, of engineering a dubious annulment, without papal approval, of his marriage to Josephine and undertaking a second marriage to the younger [[Marie Louise, Duchess of Parma|Mary Louise of Austria]], with whom he had one son, [[Napoleon II of France|Napoleon, King of Rome]], also as Napoleon II and the Duke of Reichstadt. He was not married and had no children, thus leaving no further direct descendants of Napoleon I.\n\nThe law was proclaimed on May 20, 1804. No contradiction was seen between France being a Republic and it being governed by an Emperor. Indeed, until 1809, French coins bore \"R\u00e9publique Fran\u00e7aise\" on one side and \"Napol\u00e9on Empereur\" on the other, pursuant to a decree of June 26, 1804; the legend on the reverse was replaced by \"Empire fran\u00e7ais\" by decree of October 22, 1808). This was a return to the Roman use of the word Emperor (Augustus was officially only the First Citizen, rather than monarch, of the Roman Republic).\n\n===Second French Empire===\nIn 1852, [[Napoleon III]], having restored the Bonapartes to power in France, enacted a new decree on the succession. The claim first went to his own male legitimate descendants in the male line.\n\nIf his own direct line died out, the new decree allowed the claim to pass to [[J\u00e9r\u00f4me Bonaparte]], Napoleon I's youngest brother who had previously been excluded, and his male descendants by Princess [[Catharina of W\u00fcrttemberg]] in the male line. His descendants by his original marriage to the American [[commoner]] [[Elizabeth Patterson Bonaparte|Elizabeth Patterson]], of which Napoleon I had greatly disapproved, were excluded.\n\nThe only remaining Bonapartist claimants since 1879, and today, have been descendants of J\u00e9r\u00f4me Bonaparte and Catherina of W\u00fcrttemberg in the male line.\n\n==France Post-Monarchy==\n\n===Failure of the Restoration===\nIn 1871, royalists became the majority in the National Assembly. There were two claimants to the French royal legacy: [[Henri, Count of Chambord|Henri d'Artois, Count of Chambord]], and [[Prince Philippe, Count of Paris|Philippe d'Orl\u00e9ans, Count of Paris]]. The former were supported by the Legitimists, supporters of the elder line of the Bourbons, and the Orl\u00e9anists, liberal constitutional monarchists that had supported [[Louis Philippe I|Louis Philippe]] and his line. Since the Count of Chambord was childless, and was expected to remain so, the Orl\u00e9ans line agreed to support the Count of Chambord.\n\nRaised however, by his grandfather [[Charles X of France]], as if the Revolution never happened, the Count of Chambord insisted that he would only take the crown if France would abandon the tricolour flag in favor of the white fleur de lys flag. He refused to compromise this point, which upset the restoration of the monarchy. The Orl\u00e9ans did not oppose him, and did not make an immediate claim to the throne while the Count of Chambord lived. The Count of Chambord lived, however, longer than expected. At the time of his death, monarchists no longer held a majority of the legislature and the impetus behind the monarchical restoration was lost.\n\nThus, after the death of the Count of Chambord, the Orl\u00e9ans line had two distinct claims to the throne of France: the right derived from Orl\u00e9anist theory, as heirs of [[Louis Philippe I|Louis Philippe]]; and the right derived from Legitimist theory, as heirs of Hugh Capet.\n\n===Legitimists and Orl\u00e9anists===\n{{Main|French dynastic disputes}}\n\nThe death of the Count of Chambord split the Legitimists in two camps{{citation needed|date=October 2015}}. Most acknowledged the House of Orl\u00e9ans as the new royal house{{citation needed|date=October 2015}}. Yet a party, with a hatred for that house, recognized the Carlists of Spain, then the eldest descendants of [[Philip V of Spain]]. The Orl\u00e9anist party derisively called them the [[Blancs d'Espagne]] (Spanish Whites), for having supported a Spanish prince over a French prince. In later times the Orl\u00e9anist and Legitimist claims of the House of Orl\u00e9ans was merged into the name of Orl\u00e9anist, as the pro-Spanish party assumed the name of Legitimists.\n\nThe unacceptability of the House of Orl\u00e9ans to the Blancs d'Espagne stems from the actions of two ancestors of that house \u2014 [[Louis Philippe II, Duke of Orl\u00e9ans]], also known as Philippe Egalite, and his son [[Louis Philippe I|Louis Philippe]], later King of the French. According to Charles Dumoulin, a French jurist of the sixteenth century, treason is one case wherein a person of the royal blood could be deprived of his succession to the throne.<ref name = \"giesey\">Ralph E.

The heir to the throne, according to those customs, is the heir of Louis XIV, who cannot be excluded. The Orl\u00e9anist stand is that the laws of succession could be altered, and that among those customs and precedents is the requirement that the heir must be French. The heir to the throne, according to them, is the Orl\u00e9ans line, since not one of Philip V's descendants was French when the succession opened in 1883.<ref name=\"velde\" />\n\nIn the Treaty of Utrecht, Philip V of Spain renounced his right of succession to the French throne on the condition that the semi-Salic law of succession should be instituted in Spain. For Legitimists the treaty is void ab initio, since the succession law cannot be altered in this way. Further, assuming arguendo that the treaty is valid, the repeal of semi-Salic law in Spain had broken the condition of the renunciation; the purpose of the treaty \u2014 the separation of the crowns of France and Spain \u2014 has been served, since the King of Spain is not the heir to France.<ref name=\"sainty\">{{cite web|author=Guy Stair Sainty|url= http://www.chivalricorders.org/bourbon/france/success/sucprt1.htm |title= The French Succession: The Renunciations of 1712, the Treaties of Utrecht and their Aftermath in International Affairs |publisher=chivalricorders.org |date= |accessdate=2014-09-23}}</ref> For Orl\u00e9anists the treaty is a valid alteration to the French law of succession.

For Orl\u00e9anists, foreign-born heirs forfeit their right of succession to estates in France by the law of aubain. Foreigners include, apart from the usual definition, those Frenchmen who left ''without intent of returning.'' They also cite the opinion of Charles Dumoulin, a French jurist of the sixteenth century: \n<blockquote>Common sense requires that princes of the blood who have become foreigners be excluded from the throne just as the male descendants of princesses.

The Franks began to adopt [[Christianity]] following the baptism of Clovis, an event that inaugurated the alliance between the Frankish kingdom and the Roman Catholic Church. Even so, the Merovingian kings were largely beyond the control of the [[Pope]]. Because they were able to worship with their Catholic neighbors, the newly-Christianized Franks found much easier acceptance from the local Gallo-Roman population than did the [[Arianism|Arian]] [[Visigoths]], [[Vandals]] or [[Burgundians]]. The Merovingians thus built what eventually proved the most stable of the successor-kingdoms in the west.\n\nFollowing Frankish custom, the kingdom was partitioned among Clovis' four sons, and over the next century this tradition of partition continued. Even when several Merovingian kings simultaneously ruled their own realms, the kingdom \u2014 not unlike the late [[Roman Empire]] \u2014 was conceived of as a single entity. Externally, the kingdom, even when divided under different kings, maintained unity and conquered Burgundy in 534. After the fall of the [[Ostrogoths]], the Franks also conquered [[Provence]]. Internally, the kingdom was divided among Clovis' sons and later among his grandsons which frequently saw war between the different kings, who allied among themselves and against one another. The death of one king created conflict between the surviving brothers and the deceased's sons, with differing outcomes. Due to frequent warfare, the kingdom was occasionally united under one king. Although this prevented the kingdom from being fragmented into numerous parts, this practice weakened royal power, for they had to make concessions to the nobility to procure their support in war.\n\nIn each Frankish kingdom the [[Mayor of the Palace]] served as the chief officer of state. From about the turn of the eighth century, the [[Austrasia]]n Mayors tended to wield the real power in the kingdom, laying the foundation for a new dynasty.\n\n==Carolingian dynasty==\nThe Carolingians consolidated their power in the late seventh century, eventually making the offices of mayor of the palace and ''dux et princeps Francorum'' hereditary and becoming the ''de facto'' rulers of the Franks as the real powers behind the throne.\n\nTo legalize the power already being exercised by the mayors of the palace, Pepin requested and received from the pope a decision that whoever exercised the actual power in the kingdom should be the legal ruler. After this decision the throne was declared vacant. Childeric III was deposed and confined to a monastery.\n\nAccording to ancient custom, Pepin was then elected King of the Franks by an assembly of Frankish nobles, with a large portion of his army on hand (in case the nobility inclined not to honor the Papal bull). Although such elections happened infrequently, a general rule in Germanic law stated that the king relied on the support of his leading men. These men reserved the right to choose a new leader if they felt that the old one could not lead them in profitable battle. While in later France the kingdom became hereditary, the kings of the later Holy Roman Empire proved unable to abolish the elective tradition and continued as elected rulers until the Empire's formal end in 1806. In 754 the pope reaffirmed the election of Pepin by crossing the Alps and personally anointing the new king in the Old Testament manner, as the Chosen of the Lord.\n\nBehind the pope's action lay his need for a powerful protector. In 751 the Lombards had conquered the Exarchate of Ravenna, the center of Byzantine government in Italy, were demanding tribute from the pope, and threatened to besiege Rome. Following Pepin's coronation, the pope secured the new ruler's promise of armed intervention in Italy and his pledge to give the papacy the Exarchate of Ravenna, once it was conquered. In 756 a Frankish army forced the Lombard king to relinquish his conquests, and Pepin officially gave Ravenna to the pope. Known as the \"Donation of Pepin,\" the gift made the pope a temporal ruler over the Papal States, a strip of territory that extended diagonally\nacross northern Italy.\n\nThe greatest Carolingian monarch was Charlemagne, who was crowned Emperor by Pope Leo III at Rome in 800. His empire, ostensibly a continuation of the Roman Empire, is referred to historiographically as the Carolingian Empire.\n\nThe Carolingians followed the Frankish custom of dividing inheritances among the surviving sons, though the concept of the indivisibility of the Empire was also accepted. The Carolingians had the practice of making their sons (sub-)kings in the various regions (regna) of the Empire, which they would inherit on the death of their father. Though the Carolingian Empire may have several kings, the imperial dignity was accorded only to the oldest son.\n\nCharlemagne had three legitimate sons who survived infancy: [[Charles the Younger, son of Charlemagne|Charles the Younger]], [[King of Neustria]], [[Pepin of Italy|Pepin]], [[King of Italy]], and [[Louis the Pious|Louis]], [[King of Aquitaine]]. In the ''Divisio Regnorum'' of 806, Charlemagne had slated Charles the Younger as his successor as emperor and chief king, ruling over the Frankish heartland of [[Neustria]] and [[Austrasia]], while giving Pepin the [[Iron Crown of Lombardy]], which Charlemagne possessed by conquest. To Louis's kingdom of Aquitaine, he added [[Septimania]], [[Provence]], and part of [[Burgundy (region)|Burgundy]]. But Charlemagne's other legitimate sons died \u2013 Pepin in 810 and Charles in 811 \u2013 and Louis alone remained to be crowned co-emperor with Charlemagne in 813. Pepin, King of Italy, left behind a son, [[Bernard of Italy|Bernard]]. On the death of Charlemagne in 814, Louis inherited the entire Frankish kingdom and all its possessions (the concept of successional representation was not yet well-established). But Bernard was allowed to retain control of Italy, the sub-kingdom of his father.\n\nFollowing the death of [[Louis the Pious]], the surviving adult Carolingians fought a three-year civil war ending only in the [[Treaty of Verdun]], which divided the empire into three regna while imperial status and a nominal lordship was accorded to Lothair I.\n\nThe Carolingians differed markedly from the Merovingians in that they disallowed inheritance to illegitimate offspring, possibly in an effort to prevent infighting among heirs and assure a limit to the division of the realm. In the late ninth century, however, the lack of suitable adults among the Carolingians necessitated the rise of [[Arnulf of Carinthia]], a bastard child of a legitimate Carolingian king.\n\nThe Carolingians were displaced in most of the regna of the Empire in 888. They ruled on in [[East Francia]] until 911 and they held the throne of [[West Francia]] intermittently until 987. Though they asserted their prerogative to rule, their hereditary, God-given right, and their usual alliance with the Church, they were unable to stem the principle of electoral monarchy and their propagandism failed them in the long run. Carolingian cadet branches continued to rule in Vermandois and Lower Lorraine after the last king died in 987, but they never sought thrones of principalities and made peace with the new ruling families.\n\n==Capetian dynasty==\n\n===The election of Hugh Capet===\nFrom 977 to 986, [[Hugh Capet]], son of [[Hugh the Great]], Duke of the Franks, allied himself with the German emperors Otto II and Otto III and with Archbishop [[Adalberon, Archbishop of Reims|Adalberon of Reims]] to dominate the Carolingian king, Lothair. By 986, he was king in all but name. After Lothair's son [[Louis V of France|Louis V]] died in May 987, Adalberon and Gerbert of Aurillac convened an assembly of nobles to elect Hugh Capet as their king.\n\nImmediately after his coronation, Hugh began to push for the coronation of his son [[Robert II of France|Robert]]. Hugh's own claimed reason was that he was planning an expedition against the Moorish armies harassing [[Borrel II of Barcelona]], an invasion which never occurred, and that the stability of the country necessitated two kings should he die while on expedition. Ralph Glaber, however, attributes Hugh's request to his old age and inability to control the nobility. Modern scholarship has largely imputed to Hugh the motive of establishing a dynasty against the claims of electoral power on the part of the aristocracy, but this is not the typical view of his contemporaries and even some modern scholars have been less skeptical of Hugh's \"plan\" to campaign in Spain. Robert was eventually crowned on 25 December 987. A measure of Hugh's success is that when he died in 996, Robert continued to reign without anyone disputing his rights, but during his long reign actual royal power dissipated into the hands of the great territorial magnates.\n\nThus, the early Capetians made their position ''de facto'' hereditary by associating their eldest sons to the kingship while they still live. By the death of [[Philip I of France|Philip I]], this hereditary feature had become established in custom. Even though Philip refused to have his son crowned during his lifetime, Louis succeeded with little trouble. Yet the association of the eldest son to the kingship continued for two more generations, with [[Philip II of France|Philip II Augustus]] being the last king so crowned.\n\n===The succession in 1031===\nHenry I became sole ruler on his father's death in 1031. The succession, however, was hotly contested by his younger brother [[Robert I, Duke of Burgundy|Robert]]. [[Constance of Arles]], Henry\u2019s mother, preferred to place her younger son, Robert, on the throne. She allied herself with one of the more powerful counts of the time, [[Odo II, Count of Blois]].\n\nThis alliance was particularly worrisome for Henry I. Odo II of Blois was a very powerful lord and had warred against Henry\u2019s father throughout his reign; he had enlarged his possessions to the point of encircling the royal demesne. With his alliance, the queen mother and her son Robert managed to expel King Henry from his own demesne lands, forcing him to seek refuge at the court of the duke of Normandy, [[Robert I, Duke of Normandy|Robert]].\n\nKing Henry formed an alliance with the powerful duke of Normandy, Robert, by granting him the French Vexin, or the lands between the rivers Epte and Oise. Although this has been debated by modern scholarship, the fact remains that Robert fought alongside the king. Henry also managed to gain the alliance of another powerful count, [[Baldwin IV of Flanders]].\n\nFinally, Henry added [[Emperor Henry II]] to his camp. The emperor had personal issues with Odo II. He wished nothing more than to rid himself of a powerful foe and troublesome neighbour. Odo had invaded Henry\u2019s lands in Burgundy and took many castles and places. Henry and his allies recovered the royal lands that had been lost to the usurpers. The conflict didn\u2019t end there; there was still a chance for Robert to win the throne. Henry, to guarantee his brother\u2019s submission, granted him the vast duchy of Burgundy, which had been added to the royal demesne by Robert II.\n\nOdo found himself in Imperial Burgundy against Henry II. At the battle of Bar-le-Duc, Odo was killed in battle in the year 1037. His lands and properties were divided amongst his sons, ending a threat against the Capetian monarchy.\n\nHenry I had managed to maintain his royal title and dignity, but the price was great. The greatest problem to have arisen from the crisis was the growth in independence of the lords and castellans in the lands of the royal demesne. This had the effect of weakening royal authority even further. Secondly, Henry I lost a great deal of territory and land in suppressing the revolt. The French Vexin was granted away to the duke of Normandy, the duchy of Burgundy, a substantial part of the royal demesne, was given away to Robert, the king\u2019s younger brother.\n\n====The appanage system====\nAn [[appanage]] is a fief conceded to a younger son or a younger brother of the king. In France, the origin of the appanage can be found either in the old Frankish custom of dividing the inheritance between the sons (a custom which feudalism replaced with the ''partage noble'' in which the eldest son received most of the estates); or in the fact that, at its origins, the Capetian monarchy was relatively weak, and the principle of succession by the eldest son was not secure until the late 12th century.\n\nThe first such appanage in the history of the Capetian monarchy was the duchy of Burgundy, which Henry I ceded to his younger brother Robert. Later, Louis VII gave Dreux to his son Robert, in 1137, Philip Augustus gave Domfront and Mortain to his younger son Philip Hurepel (who had also become count of Boulogne by marriage). The last two cases were not under the same kind of duress, but probably reflect the same desire to ward off quarrels.\n\nThe original appanages, just like other feudal fiefs, could pass through the female line. As the monarchy became more powerful, they began to restrict the transmission of appanages in the male line, although this did not become standard for some time. The greatest example is the [[Duchy of Burgundy]], which may have been illegally confiscated by [[Louis XI of France|Louis XI]] after the death of the last male duke. After Burgundy, the restriction to male heirs became standard (it is mentioned in an ordinance of Charles V in 1374), but was not formalized until the Edict of Moulins in 1566.<ref>{{cite web|author=Fran\u00e7ois Velde |url= http://www.heraldica.org/topics/france/apanage.htm |title=Apanages in the French Monarchy |publisher=Heraldica.org |date=2010-04-22 |accessdate=2014-09-23}}</ref>\n\nThe Capetians also conceded fiefs to daughters or sisters in the form of [[dowry]], although this practice became less and less common over time.\n\n===The end of the \"[[Capetian Miracle|Capetian miracle]]\"===\nThe [[Salic Law]] (Lex Salica) is a code of law written around the time of [[Clovis I]] for the [[Salian Franks]], in Latin mixed with Germanic words. It deals mainly with monetary compensations (wehrgeld) and also with civil law with respect to men and land. Clause 6 in title 59, which deals with inheritance rules for allodial lands (i.e. family lands not held in benefice) specifies that in \"concerning salic lands (terra Salica) no portion or inheritance is for a woman but all the land belongs to members of the male sex who are brothers.\" A capitulary of Chilperic, ca. 575, expands this by admitting inheritance by a daughter in the absence of sons: \"if a man had neighbors but after his death sons and daughters remained, as long as there were sons they should have the land just as the Salic Law provides. And if the sons are already dead then a daughter may receive the land just as the sons would have done had they lived.\" The monarchy is nowhere mentioned. The Salic Law was reformulated under Charlemagne and still applied in the 9th century, but it slowly disappeared as it became incorporated into local common laws. By the 14th century it was completely forgotten.<ref>{{cite web|author=Fran\u00e7ois Velde|url=http://www.heraldica.org/topics/france/salic.htm |title=The Salic Law |publisher=Heraldica.org |date=2005-01-13 |accessdate=2012-02-18}}</ref>\n\nFrom 987 to 1316, every king of France was fortunate to have a son to succeed him. This state of affairs lasted over three hundred years, spanning 13 generations. The Capetians did not even have to deal with the question of successional representation; Hugh Magnus, eldest son of Robert II, and Philip, eldest son of Louis VI, did not leave behind children of their own when they predeceased their respective fathers. Thus, for such a long time, the succession to the throne was undisputed, so that there was no reason for the peers of the realm to elect a new king. Since 987, the Capetians had always passed the crown to their eldest surviving son, and this birthright became itself a source of unquestionable legitimacy. Louis VIII was the last king acclaimed before the sacred unction (last remnant of the original election). From St. Louis, in 1226, King was acclaimed after the anointing. The voice of the barons was no longer necessary in determining the king.\n\n[[Philip IV of France|Philip the Fair]] was not concerned about the lack of male heirs. He had three sons, well married, and a daughter, [[Isabella of France]], Queen of England by her marriage to Edward II of England. The eldest son, [[Louis X of France|Louis the Quarrelsome]], was King of Navarre and Count of Champagne since the death of his mother. He would, at the death of his father, become King of France and Navarre. His wife, [[Margaret of Burgundy, Queen of France|Margaret of Burgundy]] had given him a daughter, but she was young and he could expect her to give him a son later. As for his two other sons, [[Philip V of France|Philip, Count of Poitiers]] and [[Charles IV of France|Charles, Count of La Marche]], they had married the two daughters of [[Otto IV, Count of Burgundy]] and [[Mahaut, Countess of Artois]], [[Joan II, Countess of Burgundy|Joan]] and [[Blanche of Burgundy|Blanche]]. The king could believe his succession was assured.\n\nEverything collapsed in the spring of 1314, when the affairs of the daughters-in-law of the king were discovered (also known as the [[Tour de Nesle Affair]]). Somewhat neglected by their husbands, the princesses entertained themselves without them. The lover of Margaret of Burgundy was a young knight named Gauthier d'Aunay. Gautier's brother, Philippe d'Aunay, was meanwhile Blanche's lover. Without participating in the adventures of her sister and her sister-in-law, Joan knew everything and kept silent. Royal reaction was brutal. The Aunay brothers were tried and executed summarily; Margaret of Burgundy died of cold in the tower of Chateau Gaillard; Blanche of Burgundy was imprisoned for ten years before ending her days in Maubuisson Abbey, near Pontoise.\n\nThe dynastic succession was jeopardized. Margaret's death would allow Louis to remarry. But for the summer of 1314, the future king of France had no wife and no son. He only had a daughter, Joan, who could not be denied the inheritance of Navarre (which allowed female inheritance). This girl was suspected of illegitimacy, because of her mother's adultery with Gauthier d'Aunay, which could be dangerous for the crown of France, given the risk of particularly serious political crises because of suspicions of illegitimacy. Any rebellious vassal, to legitimize his rebellion, could accuse the future queen of bastardy.\n\nLouis X died on June 5, 1316, having just had time to marry again, after a reign of eighteen months, leaving his new wife [[Clementia of Hungary]] pregnant. Philip of Poitiers was at Lyon at the day of the death of his brother. The prince took the regency of both France and Navarre. Joan's claim was supported by her maternal grandmother, [[Agnes of France (1260-1327)|Agnes of France]], and her uncle, [[Odo IV, Duke of Burgundy]]. The arguments they invoked in favor of Joan were in full conformity with feudal law which has always authorized a daughter to succeed to the fief in the absence of sons. Indeed, female succession was a reality in France. Aquitaine had been ruled by a duchess, Eleanor, and countesses had ruled Toulouse and Champagne, as well as in Flanders and Artois. Mahaut, Countess of Artois, belonged to the Court of Peers since 1302. Outside the realm, women have played a role in the devolution of the English crown as well as the crown of the Latin Kingdom of Jerusalem. And [[Joan I of Navarre]] had brought her kingdom of Navarre to her husband Philip the Fair. The idea that a woman would become queen of France was in itself nothing shocking to the barons. Indeed, at the death of [[Louis VIII of France|Louis VIII]], the kingdom was governed by a woman \u2014 [[Blanche of Castile]] \u2014 regent in the name of her young son [[Louis IX of France|Louis IX]].\n\nThe regent made a treaty with the Duke of Burgundy. It was agreed that if Queen Clementia of Hungary gave birth to a son, Philip will maintain the regency until his nephew's majority. In the event that the queen gave birth to a daughter, Philip undertook to renounce Navarre and Champagne in favor of the princesses, if they renounced the crown of France at the age of consent. If not, their claim was to remain, and \"right was to be done to them therein\"; but Philip would no longer renounce Navarre and Champagne.\n\nOn November 15, 1316, Queen Clementia gave birth to a son, [[John I the Posthumous|John the Posthumous]]. Unfortunately, the child lived only five days, and the kingdom remained without a direct heir. By his treaty with the Duke of Burgundy, Philip would only rule the two kingdoms as regent or governor, until Joan reached the age of consent. But Philip had himself crowned at Rheims, on January 9, 1317. Opposed by the Duke of Burgundy, and his own brother, Charles, Count of La Marche, it was thought prudent to shut the gates of the town during the ceremony. Back at Paris, an assembly of prelates, barons and burgesses acknowledged Philip as their sovereign, and asserted that \"women do not succeed to the French throne.\"\n\nThe Duke of Burgundy championed his niece's rights. Philip won him over by giving him his daughter, [[Joan III, Countess of Burgundy|Joan of France]], with the promise of the counties of Artois and Burgundy. The princess Joan, daughter of Louis X, was given an annuity of 15,000 pounds. In return, Joan of Navarre must, at her twelfth year, ratify the treaty which disinherited her, not only of her claim to France, but also of her unquestionable right to Navarre and Champagne.\n\nIn 1322, Philip V the Tall died after a reign of six years. He left only daughters. Thus, his younger brother, Charles of La Marche, would become king under the name of Charles IV the Fair. Despite two successive marriages with [[Marie of Luxembourg, Queen of France|Marie of Luxembourg]] and [[Jeanne d'\u00c9vreux|Joan of \u00c9vreux]], Charles the Fair, as his brother Philip the Tall, left only daughters when he died in 1328. Thus, in less than fourteen years, the three sons of Philip the Fair, Louis X the Quarrelsome, Philip V the Tall and Charles IV the Fair, had died.\n\nHowever, like his brother Louis X, Charles IV the Fair left his wife pregnant. Before dying, the youngest son of Philip the Fair designated as regent his cousin, [[Philip VI of France|Philip of Valois]]. He was the eldest son of Charles of Valois, brother of Philip the Fair. A few months later, Queen Joan of \u00c9vreux gave birth to a daughter, [[Blanche of France, Duchess of Orl\u00e9ans|Blanche]]. Philip of Valois, a grown man and prominent lord, had no trouble being proclaimed king by another assembly of lords and prelates in Vincennes and crowned on May 29, 1328.\n\n===The succession in 1328===\n\nKing Charles IV was no longer. He had no male descendants. He was the youngest son of Philip the Fair. The situation in 1328 was unlike that of 1316. In 1316, a king's son was competing with a brother and a younger child. In 1328, Philip of Valois was not the closest in the line, or the more direct, because the last Capetians girls left now had husbands. But the Count of Valois was the closest male relative in the male line, and he was 35 years old. He was the eldest male of the family.\n\n{{chart top|width=100%|The French royal family in 1328}}\n{{chart/start|align=center}}\n{{chart | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | AAA | |AAA='''''[[Philip III of France]] \"the Bold\"'''''<br>[[File:Arms of the Kings of France (France Ancien).svg|25px]]  r. 1270-1285}}\n{{chart | | | | | | | | | |,|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|^|-|-|-|-|-|v|-|-|-|.| | | }}\n{{chart | | | | | | | | | AAA | | | | | | | | | | | | FFF | | GGG | |AAA='''''[[Philip IV of France|Philip IV of France and Navarre ]] \"the Fair\"'''''<br/>[[File:Blason Le Palais 56.svg|25px]]  r. 1285-1314|FFF=''[[Charles of Valois|Charles of France]]<br>[[File:Blason comte fr Valois.svg|25px]]''  Count of Valois <br/>d. 1325|GGG=''[[Louis, Count of \u00c9vreux|Louis of France]]''<br>[[File:Blason ville fr Mortain (Manche).svg|25px]]  Count of \u00c9vreux<br/>d. 1319}}\n{{chart | | | |,|-|-|-|v|-|^|-|v|-|-|-|.| | | | | | | |!| | | |!| | | }}\n{{chart | | | AAA | | BBB | | CCC | | DDD |y| EEE | | FFF | | |!| | |AAA='''''[[Louis X of France]] \"the Stubborn\"'''''<br>[[File:Blason Le Palais 56.svg|25px]]  r. 1314-1316|BBB='''''[[Philip V of France]] \"the Tall\"'''''<br>[[File:Blason Le Palais 56.svg|25px]]  r. 1316-1322|CCC='''''[[Charles IV of France]] \"the Fair\"'''''<br>[[File:Blason Le Palais 56.svg|25px]]  r. 1322-1328|DDD=[[Isabella of France]]<br/>[[File:Arms of Isabella of France.svg|25px]]|EEE=''[[Edward II of England]]''<br/>[[File:Royal Arms of England (1198-1340).svg|25px]]|FFF= '''[[Philip VI of France|Philip of Valois]]'''<br>[[File:Blason comte fr Valois.svg|25px]] count of Valois [[File:Arms of the Kings of France (France Ancien).svg|25px]]<br />b. 1293}}\n{{chart | |,|-|^|-|.| | |!| | | | | | | | |!| | | | | | | | | |!|}}\n{{chart | JoI | | JII | | BBB | | | | | | EEE | | | | | | | | PhE | |JoI='''''[[John I of France]] \"the Posthumous\"'''''<br>[[File:Arms of the Kings of France (France Ancien).svg|25px]]  r. 1316|JII=[[Joan II of Navarre|Joan of France]], Queen of Navarre<br>[[File:Arms of Navarre-Coat of Arms of Spain Template.svg|25px]]  b. 1312|BBB=[[Joan III, Countess of Burgundy]]<br>[[File:Arms of County of Burgundy.svg|25px]]  b. 1308|EEE=[[Edward III of England]]<br>[[File:Royal Arms of England (1340-1367).svg|25px]]  b. 1312|PhE=[[Philip III of Navarre|Philip of \u00c9vreux]]<br>King of Navarre as Philip{{nbsp}}III<br/>[[File:COA Navarre Evreux Philippe III d'Evreux.svg|25px]]  b. 1306}}\n{{chart | | | | | |L|y|~|~| |!| |~|~|~|~|~|~|~|~|~|~|~|~|~|~|~|J| | }}\n{{chart | | | | | | CLM | | PoB | |CLM=[[Charles II of Navarre|Charles II of \u00c9vreux]]<br/>[[File:Royal Arms of Navarre (1328-1425).svg|25px]]  King of Navarre <br/>b.1332|PoB=[[Philip II, Count of Auvergne|Philip of Burgundy]]<br>[[File:Armes Philippe Monsieur de Bourgogne.svg|25px]]  b. 1323}}\n{{chart/end}}\n|-\n|style=\"text-align: left;\"|'''Notes:'''\n{{notelist-lr}}<!--- use either {{Efn-lr}} and/or <ref group=lower-roman /> To fill this notelist -->\n{{chart bottom}}\n\n====The contenders for the throne====\n\n* [[Philip VI of France|Philip, Count of Valois]], nephew of Philip IV, cousin of the last three kings, regent of the kingdom by the wish of Charles the Fair. He was in a strong position: he was popular with the nobility and supported by influential figures such as [[Robert III of Artois|Robert of Artois]]. In the male line, he was closest to the scepter.\n* [[Philip III of Navarre|Philip, Count of \u00c9vreux]], also a nephew of Philip the Fair, (he was the son of Louis of \u00c9vreux, younger half-brother of Philip IV and Charles of Valois). Philip of \u00c9vreux was also first cousin of the last three kings. Moreover, he had improved his position by marrying the daughter of Louis X, Joan of France.\n\nWhile the peers of France deliberated which of these two powerful lords would ascend the throne, a letter arrived from across the Channel. In this letter, Isabella claimed the crown of France for her young son Edward III, King of England, and he would be regarded as the third contender:\n\n* [[Edward III of England|Edward III]], King of England and Duke of Guyenne: grandson of Philip IV by his mother, Isabella, sister to Louis X, Philip V and Charles IV. He was the nephew of the last three kings of France. In 1328, he was only 16 years and is still under the tutelage of his mother.\n\nThe peers and the lawyers were studying this question: can Isabella of France transmit a right she did not have? Can her son Edward claim the crown of the Capetians?\n\nIsabella of France had a horrible reputation. Nicknamed the \"She-Wolf of France\", she joined the English nobles against her husband, King Edward II, who was defeated and captured. After putting her husband to death, she displayed herself in public with her lover, the regicide Roger Mortimer. All of this was well known in France. Also, her son Edward III belonged to the [[House of Plantagenet]], a dynasty that had long been in conflict with the French crown.\n\nBut Isabella's reasoning was flawed by a detail as it were negligible: if, as a woman, Isabella could transfer that right to the crown although she cannot have it for herself, then by primogeniture the true heir would have been [[Philip II, Count of Auvergne|Philip of Burgundy]], a grandson of Philip V of France. Isabella of France may have simply forgotten that her brothers had left daughters of their own.\n\nHowever, no one thought of nominating one of the daughters of three kings; to do so would recognize the right of women to the throne, and would be de facto considering the reigns of Philip V the Tall and Charles IV the Fair as nothing but a theft at the expense of Joan of France, daughter Louis X the Stubborn. Nor did they nominate the young Philip of Burgundy, the senior living male heir of Philip IV.\n\nThe peers did not want to risk giving the throne to a bastard. And, instead of proposing a daughter of Philip V or Charles IV, they decided that women should be excluded from succession to avoid endless squabbles of law.\n\nThe famous Salic law was rediscovered in 1358, and used in a propaganda fight to defend the rights of Valois against the claims of the English king. Thus, whatever the legal twist, the rights of Edward III were very questionable.\n\n====The king found====\nThe day after the funeral of Charles IV of France, the great nobles convened. Valois has already taken the title of regent, and used it already, while his cousin was dying. The assembly can only bow to the facts. Having postponed for a moment the question of the legitimacy of excluding women from succession, the will to rule out the English king was stronger. Edward III was thus ousted from the competition, but there remained two claimants to the throne, Philip of Valois and Philip of \u00c9vreux.\n\nAn agreement was reached to satisfy everyone. Philip of \u00c9vreux and his wife Joan received the kingdom of Navarre and other territorial compensation in exchange for which they would recognize Philip of Valois as King of France.\n\nThe kingdom of Navarre belonged to the King of France since the marriage of Philip IV and Joan I of Navarre, Countess of Champagne and Brie. Louis X had inherited Navarre from his mother and in 1328 his daughter Joan was finally recognized as Queen of Navarre, despite the suspicions of illegitimacy (the late return was not in the least prevented Philip the Tall and Charles the Fair, who officially called themselves Kings of France and Navarre). In addition, Philip of Valois, not being himself a descendant and heir of the kings of Navarre as were his predecessors, could restore the kingdom of Navarre without regret to Joan, the rightful heir, in exchange for her giving up the crown of France. The kingdom of Navarre will not return to the kings of France until much later, when Henry of Navarre, the future Henry IV, accedes to the throne of France, thus establishing the Bourbon dynasty. Thereafter, the French kings will again bear the title \"King of France and Navarre.\"\n\nSoon after, Philip of Valois was proclaimed King of France under the name of Philip VI of France by the peers of the realm. The Valois took power following the direct Capetians.\n\n===The Hundred Years War===\n\nThe last royal election dates back to Louis VIII the Lion in 1223. The royal power was weakened and so was the legitimacy of the Count of Valois, for it was not as unassailable as that of his predecessors on the throne. They were expecting their generous gifts, great concessions from the new king. Edward III came to pay tribute to French king, hoping also for some territorial compensation. Philip VI did not understand the danger that threatened him and did nothing to protect himself.\n\nThe succession to Charles IV the Fair, decided in favor of Philip VI, was used as a pretext by Edward III to transform what would have been a feudal struggle between himself as Duke of Guyenne against the King of France, to a dynastic struggle between the [[House of Plantagenet]] and the [[House of Valois]] for control of the French throne.\n\nThe conflict, known as the [[Hundred Years War]], dragged on for decades. England won several famous military victories, but was unable to fully overcome French resistance. Yet in the aftermath of the [[Battle of Agincourt]], [[Henry V of England]], great-grandson of Edward III, became the heir to the French throne in accordance to the [[Treaty of Troyes]]. He would marry [[Catherine of Valois|Catherine]], daughter of King [[Charles VI of France]], while Charles' son, the Dauphin [[Charles VII of France|Charles]] was declared illegitimate and disinherited.\n\nYet Henry V would predecease Charles VI, and it was his infant son who would become \"King of France\". The Dauphin still had his supporters, and became Charles VII. Eventually, the tide would turn in favor of the French, and the English were driven out. The Treaty of Troyes, which had been ratified by the Estates-General of France, was never repudiated, but the military victory of Charles VII rendered its provisions moot. The Kings of England would thereby continue to call themselves \"Kings of England and France\", dropping the nominal claim to France only in 1800.\n\nThus emerged the principle of the unavailability of the crown \u2014 no person or body could divert the succession from the lawful heir. The throne would pass by the sheer force of custom, not by the testament of the king, or by any edict, decree, or treaty, or by the generosity of any person. By this principle, the French do not consider Henry VI of England as a legitimate king of France.\n\n===The succession in 1589===\n{{main|Henry IV of France's succession|French Wars of Religion}}\n\nThe House of Valois had secured the principle of agnatic succession following their victory in the Hundred Years War. When the senior line of the Valois became extinct, they were followed by the Valois-Orl\u00e9ans line descended from [[Louis I, Duke of Orl\u00e9ans]], younger brother of Charles VI, and then, by the Valois-Angoul\u00eame line descended from a younger son of Louis I.\n\n[[Henry II of France]] was succeeded by his sons, none of whom would succeed in producing a male heir. The sons of Henry II would be the last heirs male of Philip III of France. Right after them ranked the Bourbons, descended from a younger brother of Philip III.\n\nThus, with the death of [[Fran\u00e7ois, Duke of Anjou]], younger brother of King [[Henry III of France]], the heir presumptive became the Head of the House of Bourbon, [[Henry IV of France|Henry III, King of Navarre]]. Since Henry was a Protestant, most of Catholic France found him unacceptable. By the [[Treaty of Nemours]], the Catholic League attempted to disinherit the King of Navarre by recognizing [[Charles, Cardinal de Bourbon]], Navarre's uncle, as heir. Navarre had been excommunicated by [[Pope Sixtus V]].\n\nOn his deathbed, Henry III called for Henry of Navarre, and begged him, in the name of Statecraft, to become a Catholic, citing the brutal warfare that would ensue if he refused. In keeping with Salic law, he named Navarre as his heir.\n\nOn Henry III's death in 1589, the League proclaimed the Cardinal de Bourbon king, while he was still a prisoner of Henry III in the castle of Chinon. He was recognized as Charles X by the Parliament of Paris on 21 November 1589. With Henry III's death, custody of the Cardinal fell to Navarre (now Henry IV of France), the Cardinal's nephew. When the old Cardinal died in 1590, the League could not agree on a new candidate. The Catholic League had great hopes for [[Charles, Duke of Guise]], whom they considered to elect as king. However, the Duke of Guise declared his support for Henry IV of France in 1594, for which Henry paid him four million livres and made him Governor of Provence. Some supported [[Infanta Isabella Clara Eugenia of Spain]], the daughter of [[Philip II of Spain]] and [[Elisabeth of Valois|Elisabeth of France]], eldest daughter of [[Henry II of France]]. The prominence of her candidacy hurt the League, which became suspect as agents of the Spanish.\n\nFor a time, Henry IV attempted to take his kingdom by conquest. For this, he had to capture Paris, which was defended by the Catholic League and the Spanish. Despite the campaigns between 1590 and 1592, Henry IV was \"no closer to capturing Paris\". Realizing that Henry III had been right and that there was no prospect of a Protestant king succeeding in resolutely Catholic Paris, Henry agreed to convert, reputedly stating \"Paris vaut bien une messe\" (\"Paris is well worth a Mass\"). He was formally received into the Catholic Church in 1593, and was crowned at Chartres in 1594 as League members maintained control of the Cathedral of Rheims, and, skeptical of Henry's sincerity, continued to oppose him. He was finally received into Paris in March 1594, and 120 League members in the city who refused to submit were banished from the capital. Paris' capitulation encouraged the same of many other towns, while others returned to support the crown after [[Pope Clement VIII]] absolved Henry, revoking his excommunication in return for the publishing of the [[Council of Trent|Tridentine Decrees]], the restoration of Catholicism in B\u00e9arn, and appointing only Catholics to high office.\n\nWith the success of Henry IV, the principles of the French succession were kept inviolable. The kingship of Charles, Cardinal de Bourbon, as Charles X, was delegitimized, having been contrary to these principles. A new requirement to the French succession was recognized: the King of France must be Catholic. Yet since religion could be changed, it could not be the basis for permanent exclusion from the throne.\n\n===The Bourbons in Spain===\n[[Louis XIV of France|Louis XIV]], grandson of Henry IV, was the longest-reigning king in European history. Louis XIV had only one son to survive to adulthood, the Dauphin [[Louis, Grand Dauphin|Louis]]. The Dauphin, in turn, had three sons: [[Louis, Dauphin of France, Duke of Burgundy|Louis, Duke of Burgundy]], [[Philip V of Spain|Philip, Duke of Anjou]], and [[Charles, Duke of Berry (1686\u20131714)|Charles, Duke of Berry]].\n\nIn 1700, [[Charles II of Spain]] died. His heir, in accordance to cognatic primogeniture followed in Spain, would have been the Dauphin Louis. However, since the Dauphin was the heir to the French throne, and the Duke of Burgundy was in turn the Dauphin's heir, Charles II settled his succession on the Duke of Anjou in order to prevent the union of France and Spain.\n\nMost European rulers accepted Philip as King of Spain, though some only reluctantly. Louis XIV confirmed that Philip V retained his French rights despite his new Spanish position. Admittedly, he may only have been hypothesizing a theoretical eventuality and not attempting a Franco-Spanish union. However, Louis also sent troops to the Spanish Netherlands, evicting Dutch garrisons and securing Dutch recognition of Philip V. In 1701, he transferred the [[asiento]] to France, alienating English traders. He also acknowledged [[James Francis Edward Stuart|James Stuart]], James II's son, as king on the latter's death. These actions enraged Britain and the United Provinces. Consequently, with the Emperor and the petty German states, they formed another Grand Alliance, declaring war on France in 1702. French diplomacy, however, secured Bavaria, Portugal and Savoy as Franco-Spanish allies.\n\nThus, the [[War of the Spanish Succession]] began. The war, over a decade long, was concluded by the treaties of [[Treaty of Utrecht (1713)|Utrecht]] (1713) and [[First Congress of Rastatt|Rastatt]] (1714). The allies were bent on removing Philip V from the succession to the French throne; he only agreed to this after the semi-Salic law was successfully enacted in Spain.\n\nHowever, the fact remained that the Treaty of Utrecht had disregarded the French principles of succession. Indeed, taking advantage of the power vacuum caused by Louis XIV's death in 1715, Philip announced he would claim the French crown if the infant Louis XV died.<ref>{{cite web|author=Fran\u00e7ois Velde |url=http://www.heraldica.org/topics/france/sixteBP-docs.htm#LXV |title=Sixte de Bourbon-Parme: Documents |publisher=Heraldica.org |date=2004-12-31 |accessdate=2012-02-18}}</ref>\n\nThe validity of the renunciations were not debated in public until the [[French Revolution]], when the [[National Assembly (French Revolution)|National Assembly]] first addressed this issue in a three-day session beginning on 15 September 1789. After many debates, the Assembly voted on a final text of a statement defining the succession to the Crown. This read: \"The crown is hereditary from male to male, by order of primogeniture, with the absolute exclusion of women and their descendants, without prejudging the effect of renunciations\". The Spanish Ambassador, the Count of Fernan Nu\u00f1ez wrote to the Spanish Prime Minister, the Count of Floridablanca, that same date: \"All the clergy and the major part of the nobility and also of the Third Estate has pronounced for the resolution favorable to the House of Spain\u2026 by 698 votes to 265 the majority had concluded the question in a sense again most advantageous for us....\"\n\nIn 1791 the French National Assembly drew up a new, written Constitution to which the King gave his assent, and which governed France for the last year of the 18th century monarchy. For the first time it was necessary to define formally, as a matter of statutory constitutional law, the system of succession, and the titles, privileges and prerogatives of the Crown. In debating the succession to the Crown the contemporary understanding of the law of succession was publicly clarified. It rebutted the assertion by some that the claim by the Spanish line is a late construct, made to satisfy the ambitions of princes deprived of other claims. Indeed, it is evident that the issue of the rights of the Spanish line to the French crown remained an important constitutional issue.\n\nWhen the issue of the rights of the Spanish line arose, the Assembly voted to include a phrase in the article on the succession that implicitly protected their rights. That this was the purpose of the clause seems certain: hence the phrase in Title III, Chapter II, article I: \n:\"The Kingship is indivisible, and delegated hereditarily to the reigning dynasty from male to male, by order of primogeniture, with the permanent exclusion of women and their descendants. (Nothing is prejudged on the effect of renunciations in the dynasty actually reigning).\"\n\n===The end of a dynasty===\nLouis XV had ten legitimate children, but there were only two sons, only one of whom survived to adulthood, [[Louis, Dauphin of France (1729-1765)|Louis, Dauphin of France]]. This did not help dispel the concerns about the future of the dynasty; should his male line fail, the succession would be disputed by a possible war of succession between the descendants of Philip V and the [[House of Orl\u00e9ans]] descended from the younger brother of Louis XIV.\n\nThe Dauphin Louis predeceased his father but left behind three sons, [[Louis XVI of France|Louis Auguste, Duke of Berry]], [[Louis XVIII of France|Louis Stanislas, Count of Provence]] and [[Charles X of France|Charles Philippe, Count of Artois]]. The Duke of Berry succeeded his grandfather as King Louis XVI.\n\nLouis XVI would be the only French king to be executed, during the [[French Revolution]]. For the first time, the Capetian monarchy had been overthrown. The monarchy would be restored under his younger brother, the Count of Provence, who took the name Louis XVIII in consideration of the dynastic seniority of his nephew, [[Louis XVII of France|Louis]], from 1793-1795 (the child never actually reigned). Louis XVIII died childless and was succeeded by his younger brother, the Count of Artois, as Charles X.\n\nCompelled by what he felt to be a growing, manipulative radicalism in the elected government, Charles felt that his primary duty was the guarantee of order and happiness in France and its people; not in political bipartisanship and the self-interpreted rights of implacable political enemies. He issued the [[July Ordinances|Four Ordinances of Saint-Cloud]], which was intended to quell the people of France. However, the ordinances had the opposite effect of angering the French citizens. In Paris, a committee of the liberal opposition had drawn up and signed a petition in which, they asked for the ordonnances to be withdrawn; more surprising was their criticism \"not of the King, but his ministers\" \u2013 thereby disproving Charles X's conviction that his liberal opponents were enemies of his dynasty. Charles X considered the ordonnances vital to the safety and dignity of the French throne. Thus, he did not withdraw the ordonnances. This resulted in the [[July Revolution]].\n\nCharles X abdicated in favor of his 10-year-old grandson, [[Henry, Count of Chambord|Henri, Duke of Bordeaux]], (forcing his son [[Louis Antoine, Duke of Angoul\u00eame|Louis Antoine]] to renounce his rights along the way) and naming [[Louis Philippe I|Louis Philippe III, Duke of Orl\u00e9ans]] Lieutenant General of the Kingdom, charging him to announce to the popularly elected Chamber of Deputies his desire to have his grandson succeed him. Louis Philippe did not do this, in order to increase his own chances of succession. As a consequence, because the chamber was aware of Louis Philippe's liberal policies and of his popularity with the masses, they proclaimed Louis Philippe, who for eleven days had been acting as the regent for his small cousin, as the new French king, displacing the senior branch of the House of Bourbon.\n\n===The House of Orl\u00e9ans===\nThe House of Orl\u00e9ans took the throne in defiance of the principles of the Capetian monarchy, and could be viewed as a separate institution altogether.\n\nUpon his accession to the throne, Louis Philippe assumed the title of King of the French \u2013 a title already adopted by Louis XVI in the short-lived Constitution of 1791. Linking the monarchy to a people instead of a territory (as the previous designation King of France and of Navarre) was aimed at undercutting the [[legitimist]] claims of Charles X and his family.\n\nBy an ordinance he signed on 13 August 1830, the new king defined the manner in which his children, as well as his sister, would continue to bear the surname \"d'Orl\u00e9ans\" and the arms of Orl\u00e9ans, declared that his eldest son, as Prince Royal (not Dauphin), would bear the title Duke of Orl\u00e9ans, that the younger sons would continue to have their previous titles, and that his sister and daughters would only be styled Princesses of Orl\u00e9ans, not of France.\n\nThe government of Louis Philippe grew increasingly conservative over the years. After ruling for 18 years, the 1848 wave of revolutions reached France and overthrew Louis Philippe. The king abdicated in favor of his nine-year-old grandson, [[Philippe, comte de Paris|Philippe, Count of Paris]]. The National Assembly initially planned to accept young Philippe as king, but the strong current of public opinion rejected that. On 26 February, the Second Republic was proclaimed.\n\n==House of Bonaparte==\n{{main|Line of succession to the French throne (Bonapartist)}}\n\n===First French Empire===\n[[Napol\u00e9on Bonaparte]] (1769-1821) came to power by a military coup on Nov 10, 1799. The regime he put in place was headed by three Consuls, and he was the First Consul. He became Consul for Life in 1802, and then transformed the regime into a hereditary monarchy in 1804. The rules of succession as set down in the constitution are:<ref>{{cite web|author=Fran\u00e7ois Velde |url=http://www.heraldica.org/topics/royalty/nap_succ.htm |title=Napoleonic Succession Laws |publisher=Heraldica.org |date=2000-09-15 |accessdate=2012-02-18}}</ref>\n*The legitimate heir to the imperial throne should pass firstly to Napoleon I's own legitimate male descendants through the male line, excluding women and their issue. Napol\u00e9on could adopt a son or grandson (aged 18 or more) of one of his brothers, if he had no children of his own. No other adoptions were allowed.\n*In default of Napol\u00e9on's line (of the body or adoptive), the succession calls [[Joseph Bonaparte|Joseph]] and his line, followed by [[Louis Bonaparte|Louis]] and his line. His other brothers, [[Lucien Bonaparte]] and [[J\u00e9r\u00f4me Bonaparte]], and their descendants, were omitted from the succession, even though Lucien was older than Louis, because they had either politically opposed the emperor or made marriages of which he disapproved. \n*Princes were forbidden from marrying without prior consent, on pain of losing their succession rights and excluding their issue; but if the marriage ended without children, the prince would recover his rights. \n* Upon extinction of the legitimate natural and adopted males, [[patrilineality|agnatic]] descendants of Napoleon I, and those of two of his brothers, [[Joseph Bonaparte|Joseph]] and [[Louis Bonaparte|Louis]], the Grand Dignitaries of the Empire (non-dynastic princely and ducal houses) would submit a proposal to the Senate, to be approved by referendum, choosing a new emperor.\n\nAt the time the law of succession was decreed Napoleon I had no legitimate sons, and it seemed unlikely he would have any due to the age of his wife, [[Jos\u00e9phine de Beauharnais|Josephine of Beauharnais]]. His eventual response was an unacceptable one, in the eyes of Catholic France, of engineering a dubious annulment, without papal approval, of his marriage to Josephine and undertaking a second marriage to the younger [[Marie Louise, Duchess of Parma|Mary Louise of Austria]], with whom he had one son, [[Napoleon II of France|Napoleon, King of Rome]], also as Napoleon II and the Duke of Reichstadt. He was not married and had no children, thus leaving no further direct descendants of Napoleon I.\n\nThe law was proclaimed on May 20, 1804. No contradiction was seen between France being a Republic and it being governed by an Emperor. Indeed, until 1809, French coins bore \"R\u00e9publique Fran\u00e7aise\" on one side and \"Napol\u00e9on Empereur\" on the other, pursuant to a decree of June 26, 1804; the legend on the reverse was replaced by \"Empire fran\u00e7ais\" by decree of October 22, 1808). This was a return to the Roman use of the word Emperor (Augustus was officially only the First Citizen, rather than monarch, of the Roman Republic).\n\n===Second French Empire===\nIn 1852, [[Napoleon III]], having restored the Bonapartes to power in France, enacted a new decree on the succession. The claim first went to his own male legitimate descendants in the male line.\n\nIf his own direct line died out, the new decree allowed the claim to pass to [[J\u00e9r\u00f4me Bonaparte]], Napoleon I's youngest brother who had previously been excluded, and his male descendants by Princess [[Catharina of W\u00fcrttemberg]] in the male line. His descendants by his original marriage to the American [[commoner]] [[Elizabeth Patterson Bonaparte|Elizabeth Patterson]], of which Napoleon I had greatly disapproved, were excluded.\n\nThe only remaining Bonapartist claimants since 1879, and today, have been descendants of J\u00e9r\u00f4me Bonaparte and Catherina of W\u00fcrttemberg in the male line.\n\n==France Post-Monarchy==\n\n===Failure of the Restoration===\nIn 1871, royalists became the majority in the National Assembly. There were two claimants to the French royal legacy: [[Henri, Count of Chambord|Henri d'Artois, Count of Chambord]], and [[Prince Philippe, Count of Paris|Philippe d'Orl\u00e9ans, Count of Paris]]. The former were supported by the Legitimists, supporters of the elder line of the Bourbons, and the Orl\u00e9anists, liberal constitutional monarchists that had supported [[Louis Philippe I|Louis Philippe]] and his line. Since the Count of Chambord was childless, and was expected to remain so, the Orl\u00e9ans line agreed to support the Count of Chambord.\n\nRaised however, by his grandfather [[Charles X of France]], as if the Revolution never happened, the Count of Chambord insisted that he would only take the crown if France would abandon the tricolour flag in favor of the white fleur de lys flag. He refused to compromise this point, which upset the restoration of the monarchy. The Orl\u00e9ans did not oppose him, and did not make an immediate claim to the throne while the Count of Chambord lived. The Count of Chambord lived, however, longer than expected. At the time of his death, monarchists no longer held a majority of the legislature and the impetus behind the monarchical restoration was lost.\n\nThus, after the death of the Count of Chambord, the Orl\u00e9ans line had two distinct claims to the throne of France: the right derived from Orl\u00e9anist theory, as heirs of [[Louis Philippe I|Louis Philippe]]; and the right derived from Legitimist theory, as heirs of Hugh Capet.\n\n===Legitimists and Orl\u00e9anists===\n{{Main|French dynastic disputes}}\n\nThe death of the Count of Chambord split the Legitimists in two camps{{citation needed|date=October 2015}}. Most acknowledged the House of Orl\u00e9ans as the new royal house{{citation needed|date=October 2015}}. Yet a party, with a hatred for that house, recognized the Carlists of Spain, then the eldest descendants of [[Philip V of Spain]]. The Orl\u00e9anist party derisively called them the [[Blancs d'Espagne]] (Spanish Whites), for having supported a Spanish prince over a French prince. In later times the Orl\u00e9anist and Legitimist claims of the House of Orl\u00e9ans was merged into the name of Orl\u00e9anist, as the pro-Spanish party assumed the name of Legitimists.\n\nThe unacceptability of the House of Orl\u00e9ans to the Blancs d'Espagne stems from the actions of two ancestors of that house \u2014 [[Louis Philippe II, Duke of Orl\u00e9ans]], also known as Philippe Egalite, and his son [[Louis Philippe I|Louis Philippe]], later King of the French. According to Charles Dumoulin, a French jurist of the sixteenth century, treason is one case wherein a person of the royal blood could be deprived of his succession to the throne.<ref name = \"giesey\">Ralph E. Giesey. The Juristic Basis of Dynastic Right to the French Throne.</ref> Philippe Egalite had voted for the abolition of the monarchy, the guilt of [[Louis XVI of France]], and the death sentence for that unhappy monarch. His son, [[Louis Philippe I|Louis Philippe]], restored in royal favor following the Bourbon Restoration, appointed lieutenant-general of the kingdom during the final days of the reign of [[Charles X of France]], overthrew the senior line by accepting kingship for himself.<ref name=\"velde\">{{cite web|author=Fran\u00e7ois Velde |url= http://www.heraldica.org/topics/france/succession.htm |title= The Succession to the French throne |publisher=Heraldica.org |date=2005-03-03 |accessdate=2014-09-23}}</ref>\n\nThe Legitimist stand is that the succession to the throne is based on customs and precedents thereafter unalterable. The heir to the throne, according to those customs, is the heir of Louis XIV, who cannot be excluded. The Orl\u00e9anist stand is that the laws of succession could be altered, and that among those customs and precedents is the requirement that the heir must be French. The heir to the throne, according to them, is the Orl\u00e9ans line, since not one of Philip V's descendants was French when the succession opened in 1883.<ref name=\"velde\" />\n\nIn the Treaty of Utrecht, Philip V of Spain renounced his right of succession to the French throne on the condition that the semi-Salic law of succession should be instituted in Spain. For Legitimists the treaty is void ab initio, since the succession law cannot be altered in this way. Further, assuming arguendo that the treaty is valid, the repeal of semi-Salic law in Spain had broken the condition of the renunciation; the purpose of the treaty \u2014 the separation of the crowns of France and Spain \u2014 has been served, since the King of Spain is not the heir to France.<ref name=\"sainty\">{{cite web|author=Guy Stair Sainty|url= http://www.chivalricorders.org/bourbon/france/success/sucprt1.htm |title= The French Succession: The Renunciations of 1712, the Treaties of Utrecht and their Aftermath in International Affairs |publisher=chivalricorders.org |date= |accessdate=2014-09-23}}</ref> For Orl\u00e9anists the treaty is a valid alteration to the French law of succession. Further, Louis Philippe was the last official ''First Prince of the Blood'', who were, by tradition, immediate heir to the throne after the royal family itself.\n\nThe second point of contention between the Legitimists and the Orl\u00e9anists is the nationality requirement. For Orl\u00e9anists, foreign-born heirs forfeit their right of succession to estates in France by the law of aubain. Foreigners include, apart from the usual definition, those Frenchmen who left ''without intent of returning.'' They also cite the opinion of Charles Dumoulin, a French jurist of the sixteenth century: \n<blockquote>Common sense requires that princes of the blood who have become foreigners be excluded from the throne just as the male descendants of princesses.

Jazz musicians [[Don Redman]], [[Cliff Edwards]] and [[Red Nichols]] all recorded examples of scat earlier than Armstrong. However, the record \"Heebie Jeebies\" in 1926 by Armstrong and \"[[Creole Love Call]]\" in 1927 by [[Duke Ellington]] and [[Adelaide Hall]] subsequently introduced scat singing to a wider audience and did much to popularize the style. Armstrong was an innovative singer who while experimenting with all kinds of sound, improvised with his voice as he did on his instrument. In one famous example, Armstrong scatted a passage on \"I'm A Ding Dong Daddy From Dumas\" \u2013 he sings \"I've done forgot the words!\" in the middle of recording before taking off in scat.\n\n[[Billie Holiday]] entered into the world of jazz singing in the early 1930s, explaining: ''I don't feel like I'm singing, I feel like I'm playing the horn.'' Holiday had a comparatively limited vocal range of just over an [[octave]], and compensated for this shortcoming with nuanced phrasing and emotional immediacy, qualities admired by a young [[Frank Sinatra]].\n\nWith the end of [[Prohibition in the United States]], a more \"danceable\" form of jazz music arose, giving birth to the [[Swing (genre)|Swing era]], and with it big bands such as those led by [[Count Basie]], [[Benny Goodman]], [[Duke Ellington]], [[Tommy Dorsey]], [[Jimmie Lunceford]], [[Glenn Miller]], [[Artie Shaw]] and [[Chick Webb]]. Many notable post war jazz singers sang with these bands in the infancy of their careers.\n\nWith the end of the Swing era, the touring [[big bands]] of the past decade were no longer a viable option, and the demise of the typical big band singer was further complicated by the advent of [[bebop]] as a creative force in jazz.\n\nThe rise of bebop saw new jazz singers such as [[Ella Fitzgerald]] rise to fame, furthering the notion of \"free voice\" - giving instrumental qualities to the voice through [[timbre]]s, registers and [[tessitura]].\n\n==1950s and 1960s==\n\nThe birth of [[rock & roll]] as a distinct genre, and a new generation of teenagers having different tastes from their previous adult audience, caused a significant decline in the popularity of jazz.\n\nAround the same time, the [[long-playing record]] (LP) was invented, freeing musicians from the time constraints of the [[extended play]] record (EP). The [[Gramophone record|LP]], being more expensive, was aimed at the adult audience who could afford to spend the extra money on records.\n\n[[Frank Sinatra]], [[Nat King Cole]] and [[Ella Fitzgerald]] released some of the most popular early LPs recorded in a jazz vein. Though constrained by the material, Ella Fitzgerald's ''Songbook'' series introduced a great many people to jazz singing.\n\n[[Eddie Jefferson]] is credited as an innovator of [[vocalese]], a musical style in which lyrics are set to an instrumental composition or solo.\n\nMany of the singers who had worked with the [[big bands]] of the swing era were now solo artists, in the prime of their careers and many had achieved fame internationally.\n\n[[Sarah Vaughan]], [[Vic Damone]], [[Mel Torm\u00e9]], [[Lambert, Hendricks & Ross]], [[Tony Bennett]], [[Billy Eckstine]], [[Dean Martin]], [[Joe Williams (jazz singer)|Joe Williams]], [[Dinah Washington]], [[Anita O'Day]], [[Julie London]], [[Chris Connor]], [[June Christy]], [[Eartha Kitt]], [[Nina Simone]], and [[Carmen McRae]] all advanced vocal jazz during this period.\n\n==1970 to future==\nVocal jazz, since 1970, has been led by notable artists including [[Mark Murphy (singer)|Mark Murphy]], [[Maxine Sullivan]], [[Sarah Vaughan]], [[Al Jarreau]], [[Carmen McRae]], [[Shirley Horn]], [[Flora Purim]], [[George Benson]], [[Carol Sloane]], [[Urszula Dudziak]], [[Bobby McFerrin]], among others.\n\nOther popular contemporary jazz vocalist include [[Diana Krall]], [[Dianne Reeves]], [[Cassandra Wilson]], [[Kurt Elling]], [[Harry Connick, Jr.]], young [[Amy Winehouse]], [[Norah Jones]], [[Madeleine Peyroux]], [[Jamie Cullum]] and [[Sylvia Brooks]].\n\nVocal jazz has been mainly a mainstream, as opposed to ''avant-garde,'' phenomenon. However, some performers, such as [[Jeanne Lee]] and [[Patty Waters]], have performed within an avant garde vein.\n\n==Vocal jazz ensembles==\n\nThroughout most of jazz history, most vocal music was performed by either a soloist or a very small group of singers, usually one to a part. In the mid-1960s, a few directors decided to try transcribing [[Big band]] charts for voices. This idea was first tried by [[Hal Malcom]] at [[Mt. Hood Community College]] in 1967 with a group called Genesis. The group hosted the oldest vocal jazz festival in the United States, the Northwest Vocal Jazz Festival. Hal Malcom directed the group for 23 years until passing it to his former student, Dave Barduhn, who directed this group until his retirement in the Spring of 2012.\n\n11 years later, in 1978, Lonnie Cline brought the jazz ensemble format to a small Idaho town and high school named Mountain Home (which won the Mt. Hood and Reno Jazz Festivals in 1978, '79, and '80), before forming a sister group to Hal's at [[Clackamas Community College]]. This group eventually took the name [[Mainstream Vocal Jazz Ensemble|Mainstream]], under which it performs today. Mainstream was a new type of ensemble, one that moved away from performing the big band arrangements and other jazz standards and began to learn and perform a wide variety of music, including jazz, rock, pop, funk, and fusion. The idea was looked down upon at first but eventually was adopted by many and is now popular in high schools across the United States.\n\nA vocal jazz ensemble usually consists of the choir, normally made up of 8\u201316 singers, and a [[rhythm section]] most often consisting of a pianist, a bassist, a guitarist, and a drummer. Singers either each hold a microphone or sing with area microphones. Vocal jazz ensembles also often sing [[a cappella]].\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==Further reading==\n* Johnson, J. Wilfred.

{"title_page": "History of the French Communist Party", "text_new": "[[File:Logo du Parti communiste fran\u00e7ais.png|thumb|Former logo (1978)]]\nThe '''[[French Communist Party]]''' (French: '''Parti Communiste Fran\u00e7ais'''; abbreviated '''PCF''') has been a part of the [[Political history of France|political scene in France]] since 1920, peaking in strength around the end of [[World War II]]. It originated when a majority of members resigned from the socialist [[French Section of the Workers' International]] (SFIO) party to set up the French Section of the Communist International (SFIC). The SFIO had been divided over support for French participation in [[World War I]] and over whether to join the [[Communist International]] (Comintern). The new SFIC defined itself as [[revolution]]ary and [[democratic centralism|democratic centralist]]. [[Ludovic-Oscar Frossard]] was its first secretary-general, and [[Ho Chi Minh]] was also among the founders. Frossard himself resigned in 1923, and the 1920s saw a number of splits within the party over relations with other left-wing parties and over adherence to the Communist International's dictates. The party gained representation in the [[Chamber of Deputies (France)|French parliament]] in successive elections, but also promoted strike action and opposed [[colonialism]]. [[Pierre S\u00e9mard]], leader from 1924 to 1928, sought party unity and alliances with other parties; but leaders including [[Maurice Thorez]] (party leader from 1930 to 1964) imposed a [[Stalinist]] line from the late 1920s, leading to loss of membership through splits and expulsions, and reduced electoral success. With the rise of [[Fascism]] this policy shifted after 1934, and the PCF supported the [[Popular Front (France)|Popular Front]], which came to power under [[L\u00e9on Blum]] in 1936. The party helped to secure French support for the Spanish [[Spanish Second Republic|Republicans]] during the [[Spanish Civil War]], and opposed the 1938 [[Munich Accords|Munich agreement]] with Hitler. During this period the PCF adopted a more patriotic image, and favoured an equal but distinct role for women in the communist movement.\n\nThe party was banned in 1939 on the outbreak of [[World War II]]. Under Comintern direction the PCF opposed the war and may have sabotaged arms production. The leadership, threatened with execution, fled abroad. After the German invasion of 1940 the party failed to persuade the occupiers to legalise its activities, and while denouncing the war as a struggle between imperialists, began to organise opposition to the occupation. When [[German invasion of the Soviet Union|Germany invaded the Soviet Union]] the next year, the Comintern declared Germany to be an enemy, and the PCF expanded its anti-German activities, forming the [[National Front (French Resistance)|National Front]] movement within the broader [[French Resistance|Resistance]] and organising direct action and political assassinations through the armed ''[[Francs-Tireurs et Partisans]]'' (FTP) group. At the same time the PCF began to work with [[Charles de Gaulle|de Gaulle]]'s \"[[Free France]]\", the London-based government in exile, and later took part in the [[National Council of the Resistance]] (CNR).\n\nBy the time the [[liberation of France|German occupation ended]] in 1944, the party had become a powerful force in many parts of France. It was among the leading parties in elections in 1945 and 1946, and entered into the governing [[Tripartisme|Tripartite]] alliance with the socialist SFIO and the Christian democratic [[Popular Republican Movement|MRP]]. The Tripartite governments pursued social reforms and [[statism]]. However, amid concerns within France and abroad over the extent of communist influence, the PCF was excluded from government in May 1947. Under pressure from Moscow, the PCF thereafter distanced itself from other parties and focussed on agitation within its trade union base. For the rest of the [[French Fourth Republic|Fourth Republic]] period the PCF, led by Thorez and [[Jacques Duclos]], remained politically isolated, still taking a Stalinist line, though retaining substantial electoral support.\n\nAlthough the PCF opposed de Gaulle's formation of the [[French Fifth Republic|Fifth Republic]] in 1958, the following years saw a ''rapprochement'' with other left-wing forces and an increased strength in parliament. With [[Waldeck Rochet]] as its new secretary-general, the party supported [[Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand]]'s unsuccessful presidential bid in 1965 and started to move apart to a limited extent from the Soviet Union. During the student riots and strikes of [[May 1968 in France|May 1968]], the party supported the strikes while denouncing the revolutionary student movements. After heavy losses in the ensuing parliamentary elections, the party adopted [[Georges Marchais]] as leader and in 1973 entered into a \"Common Programme\" alliance with Mitterrand's reconstituted [[French Socialist Party|Socialist Party]] (PS). Under the Common Programme, however, the PCF steadily lost ground to the PS, a process that continued after Mitterrand's victory in 1981.\n\nInitially allotted a minor share in Mitterrand's government, the PCF resigned in 1984 as the government turned towards fiscal orthodoxy. Under Marchais the party continued loyal to the Soviet Union up to its fall in 1991, and made little move towards \"[[Eurocommunism]]\". Extensive reform of the party's structure and policies had to wait until 1994, when [[Robert Hue]] became leader. The party's renunciation of much traditional communist dogma after this did little to stem its declining popularity, although it entered government again in 1997 as part of the [[Plural Left]] coalition. Elections in 2002 gave worse results than ever for the PCF, now led by [[Marie-George Buffet]]. Under Buffet, the PCF turned away from parliamentary strategy and sought broader social alliances. It condemned the [[Nicolas Sarkozy]] government's response to [[2005 civil unrest in France|riots in 2005]] and adopted a more militant stance towards the [[European Union]]. Buffet's attempt to stand in the [[2007 French presidential election|2007 presidential election]] as a common candidate of the \"anti-liberal left\" had little success. To maintain a presence in parliament after 2007 the party's few remaining deputies had to group together with those from [[The Greens (France)|The Greens]] and others to create the [[Democratic and Republican Left group]] (GDR). Subsequently, a broader electoral coalition, the [[Left Front (France)|Left Front]] (FG), was formed including the PCF, [[Jean-Luc M\u00e9lenchon]]'s [[Left Party (France)|Left Party]] (PG), [[United Left (France)|United Left]], and others. The FG has continued up to the present and has brought the French communists somewhat better electoral results, at the price of some tension within the party and with other parties in the FG. With [[Pierre Laurent (politician)|Pierre Laurent]] as leader since 2010, in a symbolic move the party no longer includes the [[hammer and sickle]] logo on its membership cards.\n\n== Foundation ==\n\nThe French Communist Party was founded in December 1920 by a split in the socialist [[French Section of the Workers' International]] (SFIO), led by the majority of party members who supported membership in the [[Communist International]] (or \"Comintern\") founded in 1919 by [[Lenin]] after the [[Bolshevik Revolution]] in [[Russia]].\n\nThe outbreak of [[World War I]] in 1914 sparked tensions within the SFIO, when a majority of the SFIO took what left-wing socialists called a \"[[social-chauvinist]]\" line in support of the French war effort. Gradually, anti-war factions gained in influence in the party and [[Ludovic-Oscar Frossard]] was elected general secretary in October 1918. Additionally, the success of the [[Bolshevik Revolution]] in [[Russia]] aroused hope for a similar communist revolution in France among some SFIO members.\n\nAfter the war, the issue of membership in the new [[Communist International]] became a major issue for the SFIO. In the spring of 1920, Frossard and [[Marcel Cachin]], director of the party newspaper ''[[L'Humanit\u00e9]]'', were commissioned to meet with Bolshevik leaders in Russia. They observed the second congress of the [[Communist International]], during the course of which [[Vladimir Lenin]] set out the 21 conditions for membership. When they returned, Frossard and Cachin recommended that the party join the Communist International.\n\nAt the SFIO's [[Tours Congress]] in December 1920, this opinion was supported  by the left-wing faction ([[Boris Souvarine]], [[Fernand Loriot]]) and the 'centrist' faction ([[Ludovic-Oscar Frossard]], [[Marcel Cachin]]), but opposed by the right-wing faction ([[L\u00e9on Blum]]). This majority option won three quarters of the votes from party members at the congress. The pro-Comintern majority founded a new party, known as the French Section of the Communist International (''Section fran\u00e7aise de l'Internationale communiste'', SFIC), which accepted the strict conditions for membership.\n\nA majority of socialist parliamentarians and local officeholders were opposed to membership, particularly because of the Communist International's strict [[democratic centralism]] and its denunciation of [[Parliamentary system|parliamentarianism]]. These members went on to form a rump SFIO, which had a much smaller membership than the SFIC but which could count on a strong base of officeholders and parliamentarians.\n\nThe founders of the SFIC took with them the party paper ''[[L'Humanit\u00e9]]'', founded by [[Jean Jaur\u00e8s]] in 1904, which remained tied to the party until the 1990s. In the [[General Confederation of Labour (France)|General Confederation of Labour]] (CGT) trade unions, the Communist minority split away to form the [[United General Confederation of Labour]] (CGTU) in 1922.\n\nThe new communist party defined itself as a revolutionary party, which used legal as well as clandestine or illegal means. The party organization was run under strict democratic centralist precepts, until the 1990s: the minority factions were compelled to follow the majority faction, any organized factions or contrary opinions were forbidden, while membership was tightly controlled and dissidents often purged from the party.\n\n[[Ho Chi Minh]], who would create the [[Viet Minh]] in 1941 and then declare the independence of [[Vietnam]], was one of its founding members.<ref name=\"ho\">{{cite book |title=Ho Chi Minh: A Life |url=https://archive.org/details/hochiminh00duik |url-access=registration |last=Duiker |first=William J. |authorlink=William J.

Entitled ''The truth about the colonies'', the first section was dedicated to abuses committed during the colonial conquests, and quoted [[Albert Londres]]' and [[Andr\u00e9 Gide]]'s criticisms of [[forced labour]] while the second one contrasted the Soviet policy on nationalities with 'imperialist colonialism'.]] -->\n\nIn its early years, as the communists fought the SFIO for control of the French left, the new party was weakened and marginalized by a series of splits and expulsions.\n\nThe \"bolshevization\" or [[Stalinism|stalinization]] imposed by the [[Communist International]], as well as [[Grigory Zinoviev|Zinoviev]]'s power over the Communist International, led to internal crises. \"Bolshevization\" implied not only the adoption of the political strategy of the [[Communist International]] but a reorganization of party's structure on the model of the Bolsheviks (discipline, local organization under the shape of \"cells\", ascent of a young political staff which came from the working-class).\n\nThe first secretary-general of the PCF, [[Ludovic-Oscar Frossard]], was often reluctant to obey the directives of the [[Communist International]]. Indeed, the party leadership was opposed to the strategy of the \"proletarian unique front\". Furthermore, one of Frossard's internal opponents, [[Boris Souvarine]], was a member of the secretariat of the [[Communist International]]. Frossard resigned and left the PCF in 1923 to found a dissident United Communist Party which later became the Communist Socialist Party (but Frossard himself rejoined the SFIO). The general secretariat of the Party was shared by [[Louis Sellier]] (center faction) and [[Albert Treint]] (left-wing faction). At the same time, Boris Souvarine was expelled from the [[Communist International]] and the PCF due to his sympathy for [[Leon Trotsky]].\n\nIn the [[1924 French legislative election|1924 legislative election]], the PCF won 9.8% of the vote and 26 seats, considerably weaker than the SFIO. But under the leadership of the left-wing faction, priority was given to general strikes and revolutionary actions rather than elections. In the French Parliament, the PCF's first elected deputies were opposed to the ''[[Cartel des Gauches]]'' coalition formed by the SFIO and the [[Radical-Socialist Party (France)|Radical Party]], which governed between 1924 and 1926.\n\nIn order to reconcile the various factions of the party, [[Pierre S\u00e9mard]], railroad worker and union activist, was chosen as the new secretary-general. He wanted to put an end to sectarianism, which was criticized by communist officeholders and leaders of the CGTU. Most notably, he proposed alliances with other left-wing parties (including the SFIO) in order to combat fascism. This strategy was criticized by the board of the [[Communist International]] as \"parliamentarist\". At the same time, the party campaigned against French colonialism in [[Morocco]] (the [[Rif War]]), leading to the detention of some PCF members, including S\u00e9mard. On his release from prison, he became more and more controversial. Only 11 PCF candidates were elected in the [[Chamber of Deputies (France)|Chamber of Deputies]] in the [[1928 French legislative election|1928 election]], although the PCF increased its support to 11%.\n\nIn 1927, in the [[Soviet Union]], [[Josef Stalin]] sidelined his opponents ([[Grigory Zinoviev|Zinoviev]], [[Kamenev]] and [[Leon Trotsky]]) and imposed a strict \"class against class\" line on the Communist International. In France, a Stalinist committee took control of the PCF . Its most influential figures came from the Communist Youth, notably [[Henri Barb\u00e9]] and [[Pierre C\u00e9lor]]. They applied the \"class against class\" political line of the [[Communist International]], denouncing social democracy and the SFIO as akin to bourgeois parties. Simultaneously, the new leadership purged dissidents, like [[Louis Sellier]], former secretary-general, who created the [[Worker and Peasant Party]], which merged with the [[Communist Socialist Party]] to form the [[Proletarian Unity Party (France)|Party of Proletarian Unity]] (PUP). By the end of the 1920s, the party contained fewer than 30,000 members.\n\nThe collegial leadership of the party was divided between young leaders and more experienced politicians. The secretary for organization, [[Maurice Thorez]], was chosen as the new secretary-general in 1930. In 1931, Barb\u00e9 and Celor were accused of responsibility for excesses in the \"class against class\" strategy. Nonetheless, the strategy was continued.\n\nIndeed, the [[Wall Street Crash of 1929]] and the [[Great Depression of 1929|Great Depression]], which affected France beginning in 1931, caused much anxiety and disturbance, as in other countries. As [[economic liberalism]] failed, many were eagerly looking for new solutions. [[Technocracy (bureaucratic)|Technocratic]] ideas were born during this time (''[[Groupe X-Crise]]''), as well as [[autarky]] and [[corporatism]] in the fascist movement, which advocated union of workers and employers. Some members were attracted to these new ideas, most notably [[Jacques Doriot]]. A member of the presidium of the Executive Committee of the Comintern from 1922 onwards, and from 1923 onwards the secretary of the French Federation of Young Communists, later elected to the French [[Chamber of Deputies (France)|Chamber of Deputies]] from [[Saint-Denis, Seine-Saint-Denis|Saint-Denis]], he came to advocate an alliance between the Communists and SFIO. Doriot was then expelled in 1934, and with his followers. Afterwards he moved sharply to the right and formed the [[French Popular Party]], which would be one of the most [[collaborationism|collaborationist]] parties during the [[Vichy France|Vichy regime]].\n\nThe PCF was the main organizer of a counter-exhibition to the [[1931 Colonial Exhibition in Paris]], called \"The Truth about the Colonies\". In the first section, it recalled [[Albert Londres]] and [[Andr\u00e9 Gide]]'s critics of [[forced labour]] in the colonies and other crimes of the [[New Imperialism]] period; in the second section, it contrasted [[imperialism|imperialist]] [[colonialism]] to \"the Soviets' policy on nationalities\". In 1934 the [[Tunisia]]n Federation of the PCF became the [[Tunisian Communist Party]].<ref>Gilberg, Trond. ''Coalition Strategies Of Marxist Parties''. [[Durham, North Carolina|Durham]]: Duke University Press, 1989. p. 256</ref>\n\nThe PCF suffered substantial losses in the [[1932 French legislative election|1932 election]], winning only 8% of the vote and 10 seats. The 1932 election saw the victory of another ''Cartel des gauches''. This time, although the PCF did not participate in the coalition, it supported the government from the outside (''soutien sans participation''), similar to how the Socialists, prior to the First World War, had supported republican and Radical governments without participating.\n\nThe Communist Party attracted various intellectuals and [[French art of the 20th century|artists in the 1920s]], including [[Andr\u00e9 Breton]], the leader of the [[surrealism|Surrealist]] movement, [[Henri Lefebvre]] (who would be expelled in 1958), [[Paul \u00c9luard]], [[Louis Aragon]], and others.\n\n==The Popular Front (1934\u20131939)==\n\n{{Main|Popular Front (France)}}\nThis second Cartel coalition fell following the far-right [[6 February 1934 riots]], which forced Radical Prime Minister [[\u00c9douard Daladier]] to cede power to the conservative [[Gaston Doumergue]]. Following this crisis, the PCF, like the whole of the socialist movement, feared that France was on the verge of fascist takeover. [[Adolf Hitler]]'s rise to power in 1933 and the destruction of the [[Communist Party of Germany]] following the 27 February 1933 [[Reichstag fire]] led Moscow and Stalin to change course, and adopt the  [[popular front]] strategy whereby communists were to form anti-fascist coalitions with their erstwhile socialist and bourgeois enemies. [[Maurice Thorez]] spearheaded the formation of an alliance with the SFIO, and later the [[Popular Front (France)|Popular Front]] in 1936.\n\nDuring the Popular Front era (after 1934) the PCF rapidly grew in size and influence, its growth fueled by the popularity of the Comintern's [[Popular Front]] strategy, which allowed an anti-fascist [[Popular Front (France)|alliance]] with the SFIO and the [[Radical Party (France)|Radical Party]]. The PCF made substantial gains in the 1934 cantonal elections and established themselves as the dominant political force in working-class municipalities surrounding [[Paris]] (the Red Belt) in the 1935 municipal elections.\n\nThe Popular Front won the [[1936 French legislative election|1936 elections]]; the PCF itself made major gains - taking 15.3% and 72 seats. SFIO leader [[L\u00e9on Blum]] formed a Socialist-Radical government, supported from the outside by the PCF. However, the Popular Front government soon collapsed under the strains of domestic financial problems (including inflation) and foreign policy issues (the radicals opposed intervention in the [[Spanish Civil War]] while the socialists and communists were in favour), and was replaced by a moderate government led by [[\u00c9douard Daladier]].\n\nAs the only major communist party in western Europe that was still legal, the PCF played a major role in supporting the [[Spanish Second Republic]] during the [[Spanish Civil War]], alongside the Soviet Union. Blum's government officially maintained a neutral policy of non-intervention, but in practice his government ensured the safe passage of aid and Soviet weapons to the besieged Spanish republicans. The PCF often played a major role in such actions, and it sent a number of French volunteers to fight for the republicans in the [[International Brigades]]. At the end of the conflict, the PCF organized humanitarian aid for Spanish refugees.\n\nThe PCF's 72 deputies (along with only three others) opposed the ratification of the [[Munich Accords]], signed by Daladier and [[Neville Chamberlain]]. The PCF believed that the accords would allow Hitler to turn his attention eastwards, towards the Soviet Union.\n\nOn 12 August 1936, a party organization was formed in [[Madagascar]], the [[Communist Party (French Section of the Communist International) of the Region of Madagascar]].<ref>Thomas, Martin.

In the 1930s there was a new model, of a separate but equal role for women. The Party set up the Union des Jeunes Filles de France (UJFF) to appeal to young working women through publications and activities geared to their interests. The Party discarded its original notions of Communist femininity and female political activism as a gender-neutral revolutionary. It issued a new model more attuned to the mood of the late 1930s and one more acceptable to the middle class elements of the Popular Front. It now portrayed the ideal Young Communist as a paragon of moral probity with her commitment to marriage and motherhood, and gender-specific public activism.<ref>Susan B.

The non-aggression pact between the Nazis and Moscow dismayed many French communists, a number of whom rejected the pact. A fifth of the PCF's caucus left the party, forming a dissident parliamentary group.\n\nShortly after France entered [[World War II]] in September 1939, the PCF was declared a proscribed organisation by [[\u00c9douard Daladier]]'s government. At first the PCF reaffirmed its commitment to national defense, but after the Comintern addressed French Communists by declaring the war to be 'imperialist', the party changed its stance. PCF parliamentarians signed a letter calling for peace and viewed Hitler's forthcoming peace proposals favourably. The Comintern ordered the PCF leadership to flee to [[Belgium]], while [[Maurice Thorez]], on [[Georgi Dimitrov]]'s orders, deserted the army and fled to Moscow in order to escape prosecution. The PCF became a clandestine organization, at first rather disorganized.<ref>{{Cite book|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=3IeGuqVcUGIC&pg=PA121&lpg=PA121&dq=french+communist+party+1940&source=bl&ots=CyNQSO7Vxa&sig=rDrm_uNBY6bdF-_bSkgARm077UM&hl=en&ei=4uYHSvTzMpGKtgOt3J3rAQ&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=5#PPA122,M1|title=Julian Jackson, The Fall of France: The Nazi Invasion of 1940}}</ref> In France, the government dissolved all Communist-led local administrations, cracked down on communist trade unionists and targeted the ''[[L'Humanit\u00e9]]'' newspaper.<ref>Courtois, St\u00e9phane ''Le PCF dans la guerre'', Ramsay, 1980, p.56\u201368</ref> The government decreed that any communist propaganda, assimilated to Nazi propaganda, would be punished by the [[death penalty]].\n\nDomestically, the PCF led anti-war actions, but although the party published pacifist propaganda for soldiers they stopped short of inciting desertion. The role of the PCF in alleged sabotage operations, against armaments plants, has been a point of debate among historians. In 1951, A. Rossi listed a number of sabotage operations initiated by the PCF against armaments factories throughout France,<ref>A. Rossi, ''Les communistes pendant la dr\u00f4le de guerre'', les Iles d'Or, 1951, r\u00e9\u00e9d \u00c9d. de l'Albatros, 1978</ref> but later historians have downplayed the PCF's role in any such actions, stating that they were isolated cases.<ref>Jean-Pierre Az\u00e9ma, ''De Munich \u00e0 la Lib\u00e9ration, 1938\u20131944'', Points Seuil, 1979, p. 46</ref>\n\nAfter the [[German invasion of France in 1940]] and the ensuing [[Nazi occupation of France]], the relationship between the Communists and the German occupiers fluctuated. The domestic leadership, led by [[Maurice Tr\u00e9and]] with the knowledge of [[Jacques Duclos]], petitioned the Germans to allow the republication of ''L'Humanit\u00e9'', which would take a neutral stance on the occupation. But these negotiations were a disaster for the party, as [[Hitler]] disavowed [[Otto Abetz]] and Vichy was successfully able to oppose the legalization of the PCF. Nevertheless, the PCF limited openly anti-German or anti-occupation actions and instead adopted virulently anti-British, anti-imperialist, anti-socialist and anti-Vichy/P\u00e9tain rhetoric which shied away from directly attacking the Nazi occupiers.<ref>Courtois, St\u00e9phane ''Le PCF dans la guerre'', Ramsay, 1980, p. 139-140</ref> In return, Otto Abetz would have allowed for the liberation of over 300 communist prisoners.<ref>Peschanski, Denis, ''Les avatars du communisme fran\u00e7ais de 1939 \u00e0 1941'' in ''La France des ann\u00e9es noires'', \u00e9ditions du Seuil, coll.

In August 1940, a new policy categorically forbade any expressions of solidarity with the occupiers and limited interactions between the PCF and the occupiers.\n\nSimultaneously, however, many communists and PCF cells reorganized clandestinely and began organizing opposition to the Germans and [[Philippe P\u00e9tain]]'s regime in Vichy. One of the major actions organized by the PCF against the occupation forces was a demonstration of thousands of students and workers, staged in Paris on 11 November 1940. In May 1941, the PCF helped to organize more than 100,000 miners in the Nord and Pas-de-Calais departments in a strike. On 26 April 1941, the PCF called for a National Front for the independence of France with the Gaullists.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=okNGTtMQFL8C&pg=PA228&dq=26+April+1941+PCF&sig=ACfU3U0Rmy3GFL99E08jEkVt2Bxife5x9A|title=Matt Perry, Prisoners of Want}}</ref> The Vichy French police, and later the Germans, began to arrest and intern large number of communists.\n\n===Armed resistance (June 1941 \u2013 1945)===\n[[File:Logo Front National (ann\u00e9e 1945).png|thumb|National Front logo, 1945]]\nWhen [[German invasion of the Soviet Union|Germany invaded the Soviet Union in June 1941]], Stalin ordered all communists to engage in the armed struggle against the new Nazi enemy. The PCF expanded [[French Resistance|Resistance]] efforts within France notably advocating the use of direct action and political assassinations which had not been systematically organized up until this point. In August 1941, [[Pierre Georges]] (Colonel Fabien) shot and killed a German naval officer in the [[Paris m\u00e9tro]]. In October, the Germans stepped up reprisal actions, ordering the execution of 22 interned communists at [[Ch\u00e2teaubriant]] including the 17-year-old [[Guy M\u00f4quet]], later honoured as a hero of the resistance.\n\nBy late 1941 and early 1942, the PCF set up the ''[[Francs-Tireurs et Partisans]]'' (FTP), the armed faction of the communist-led [[National Front (French Resistance)|National Front]]. At the same time, with Moscow's blessing, the PCF engaged in talks with [[Charles de Gaulle]], the leader of [[Free France]] in [[London]]. The communists began cooperating with the Free French, all the while maintaining their distance from other resistance organizations in the north and the south\u2014remaining independent of the [[Mouvements Unis de la R\u00e9sistance|Unified Movements of the Resistance]] (MUR), the structure organized by [[Jean Moulin]] which organized the southern resistance. The National Front, PCF and CGT participated in the creation of the [[National Council of the Resistance]] (CNR) in May 1943.\n\nDuring this time period, the PCF was led by [[Jacques Duclos]] and [[Beno\u00eet Frachon]], operating out of the [[Hurepoix]] region in the [[Essonne]] department south of Paris. Under their leadership, the PCF maintained strong internal cohesion under centralized authority, which greatly boosted their power and influence within the resistance movement. In the regions, local communists played significant roles in spearheading the resistance. Most famously, the PCF activist [[Georges Guingouin]] organized and led the ''[[Maquis (World War II)|maquis]]'' in the [[Haute-Vienne]] ([[Limousin]]). Immigrant workers linked to the PCF partook in resistance operations through the [[FTP-MOI]] (''Francs-tireurs et partisans \u2013 main-d'\u0153uvre immigr\u00e9e'').\n\nBy 1944 the PCF had reached the height of its influence, and was powerful in large areas of the country through the Resistance units under its command. Some in the PCF wanted to launch a revolution as the Germans withdrew from the country, but the leadership, acting on Stalin's instructions, opposed this and adopted a policy of co-operating with the Allied powers and advocating a new Popular Front government. Many well-known figures joined the party during the war, including [[Pablo Picasso]], who joined the PCF in 1944.\n\n[[File:Vote-communiste-1945-2007.png|thumb|Share of vote at elections, 1945\u20132007]]\n\n==Provisional Government and the Fourth Republic (1945\u20131958)==\n{{Further|French Fourth Republic |France in the twentieth century}}\n\n===The PCF at its peak and the Tripartite governments (1945\u20131947)===\n\nThe Communists came out extraordinarily strengthened from the [[French Resistance|Resistance]], in terms of both organisation and prestige. With the [[liberation of France]] in 1944, the PCF, along with other resistance groups, entered the government of [[Charles de Gaulle]]. As in [[History of the Italian Republic|post-war Italy]], the communists were very popular and formed one of the major political forces in the country. The PCF was nicknamed the \"party of the 75,000 executed people\" (''le parti des 75 000 fusill\u00e9s'') because of its important role during the Resistance.\n\nBy the close of 1945 party membership stood at half a million, an enormous increase from its pre-Popular Front figure of less than thirty thousand. In the first post-war [[1945 French legislative election|elections]] for the unicameral interim Constituent National Assembly in October 1945, the PCF became the single largest party in France with 26.2% of the vote and 159 seats. In the [[June 1946 French legislative election|June 1946 elections]] for another constituent assembly, the PCF placed second but remained strong with 26% and 153 seats. In the [[November 1946 French legislative election|November 1946 elections]], which elected the first legislature of the new [[French Fourth Republic]], the PCF obtained its best result in its history \u2013 28.3% and 182 seats.\n\nBetween 1944 and May 1947, the PCF participated in governing coalitions. [[Maurice Thorez]] served in cabinet between November 1945 and May 1947, including a period as vice-president of the council of ministers between January 1946 and May 1947. The PCF was a core component of the [[Three-parties|Tripartite]] alliance with the [[French Section of the Workers' International]] (SFIO) and the [[Christian democracy|Christian democratic]] [[Popular Republican Movement]] (MRP) throughout this period. The tripartite governments under the provisional government (GPRF) and, after October 1946, the Fourth Republic, introduced a program of social reforms which laid the foundations of the French [[welfare state]]. This included the [[nationalization]] of strategic economic sectors ([[\u00c9lectricit\u00e9 de France|electricity]] (EDF) in 1946, the [[AGF (company)|AGF]] insurance firm, the [[Cr\u00e9dit Lyonnais]] bank in 1945 and the [[Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale]] bank in 1946, as well as the nationalization of the car maker [[Renault]]). [[Trade union]] independence was guaranteed by the 1946 [[Charter of Amiens]], a [[minimum wage]] established in 1947. This program comprised a substantial part of the so-called ''[[social rights|acquis sociaux]]'' (social rights) established in France during the second half of the twentieth century. Although the PCF were the largest party in most tripartite governments formed between 1945 and 1947, they never obtained the [[Prime Minister of France|presidency of the council of ministers]] and only rarely held strategic cabinet portfolios such as finance, defense or the interior. PCF cabinet ministers usually held the public health, armaments, reconstruction, industrial production and labour portfolios. ([[Ambroise Croizat]] was minister of labour between 1945 and 1947.\n\nThe PCF and socialists played a major role in drafting the proposed April 1946 constitution, but it was rejected by voters in a [[May 1946 French constitutional referendum|referendum]] in May 1946, with 53% against.\n\nThe party's strong electoral showing and surge in membership led some observers, including American under-secretary of state [[Dean Acheson]], to believe that a Communist takeover of France was imminent. A number of factors came to precipitate the expulsion of all PCF ministers from [[Paul Ramadier]]'s government in May 1947. Abroad, the PCF refused to vote war credits for the [[First Indochina War]] and the violent repression of the [[Madagascar insurrection]] by the SFIO government created strains with its coalition partners. The [[United States]] were worried of communist power in France and Italy, and conditioned [[Marshall Plan]] aid to the expulsion of communists from governments in both countries. Domestically, large-scale strikes broke out at [[Renault]] factories in April 1947. The PCF was finally expelled from government in May 1947, the same time as the [[Italian Communist Party]] (PCI) were expelled from the Italian government. The PCF responded with a series of strikes and sabotages.\n\n===Political isolation (1947\u20131956)===\n\nThe PCF remained isolated thereafter until [[Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand]]'s electoral victory in 1981. It thus began to pursue a more militant policy, alienating it SFIO and prompting divisions and tensions on the French left. The PCF fell back on its union activities, at a time when the PCF tightly controlled the [[General Confederation of Labour (France)|General Confederation of Labour]] (CGT), one of the largest and most militant unions in France.\n\nThe PCF, no longer restrained by the responsibilities of office, was free after 1947 to channel the widespread discontent among the working class with the poor economic performance of the new Fourth Republic. Furthermore, the PCF was under orders from Moscow to take a more radical course, reminiscent of the [[Third Period]] policy once pursued by the [[Comintern]]. In September 1947 several European Communist parties met in Szklarska Por\u0119ba in Poland, where a new international agency, the [[Cominform]], was set up. During this meeting [[Andrei Zhdanov]], standing in for [[Joseph Stalin]], denounced the 'moderation' of the French Communists and their excessive participation in 'bourgeois' parliamentary governments, even though this policy had been previously approved by Moscow.\n\nThe PCF denounced the administration as the tool of American [[capitalism]]. Following the arrest of some steel workers in [[Marseille]] in November 1947, the CGT called a strike, as PCF activists attacked the town hall and other 'bourgeois' targets in the city. When the protests spread to Paris, and as many as 3 million workers joined the strike, Ramadier resigned.\n\nThis development was prevented by the determination of [[Robert Schuman]], the new Prime Minister, and [[Jules Moch]], his Minister of the Interior. It was also prevented by a growing sense of disquiet among sections of the labour movement with PCF tactics, which included the derailment in early December 1947 of the Paris-Tourcoing Express, which left twenty-one people dead. Sensing a change of mood, the CGT leadership backed down and called off the strikes. From this point forward the PCF moved into permanent opposition and political isolation, a large but impotent presence in French politics.\n\nThe party remained tightly controlled by Thorez, Duclos and Frachon (although the latter focused his activities on the CGT). Thorez remained secretary-general and uncontested leader of the PCF until his death in 1964, but he suffered [[hemiplegia]] in 1950 and was often in Moscow for treatment. Duclos, in his absence, became the ''de facto'' leader of the PCF. Under Duclos' leadership, potential rivals ([[Andr\u00e9 Marty]] and [[Charles Tillon]]) were sidelined and [[Auguste Lec\u0153ur]], a rising star, was purged from the party in 1954.\n\nThe PCF remained a loyally Stalinist party throughout the period, and the PCF opposed the de-stalinization process begun by Moscow and other communist parties after Stalin's death in 1953. The PCF strongly supported the [[Soviet invasion of Hungary]] in 1956. A split occurred as [[Maoism|Maoists]] left during the late 1950s. Some moderate communist intellectuals, such as historian [[Emmanuel Le Roy Ladurie]], disillusioned with the policies of the Soviet Union, left the party after the violent suppression of [[Hungarian Revolution of 1956]].\n\nThe PCF suffered losses in the [[1951 French legislative election|1951 election]], winning 26.3% of the vote and 103 seats - a loss of 79 seats. The PCF and the [[Gaullist]] [[Rally of the French People]] (RPF) were sidelined and marginalized by the new governing coalition, the [[Third Force (France)|Third Force]] (a SFIO-Radical-MRP alliance). The Third Force's changes to the electoral law before the 1951 election were designed to weaken the PCF and RPF. Hence, the PCF lost 79 seats and won fewer seats than the SFIO (107) although it had 26.3% of the vote against only 15.4% for the SFIO. The PCF won 25.4% and 150 seats in the [[1956 French legislative election|1956 election]]. The PCF remained in opposition throughout this period, but as a major parliamentary force they contributed to the governmental instability of the Fourth Republic.\n\n[[Jean-Paul Sartre]], a \"comrade\" of the Communist party, actively supported the [[National Liberation Front (Algeria)|National Liberation Front]] (FLN) (the [[Jeanson network|''porteurs de valises'' networks]], in which [[Henri Curiel]] took part). Long debates took place on the role of [[conscription]]. While this stance by the PCF may have helped it retain widespread popularity in metropolitan France, it lost it credibility on the radical left. Nevertheless, during his scholarship to study radio engineering in Paris (from 1949 to 1953), [[Pol Pot]], like many other colonials educated in France (e.g. [[Ho Chi Minh]] in 1920), joined the French Communist Party.\n\nIn 1959 the PCF federation in [[R\u00e9union]] was separated from the party, and became the [[Reunionese Communist Party]].<ref>Gilberg, Trond. ''Coalition Strategies Of Marxist Parties''. [[Durham, North Carolina|Durham]]: Duke University Press, 1989. p. 265</ref>\n\n==Fifth Republic (1958\u2013present)==\n{{Further|French Fifth Republic |France in the twentieth century}}\n\n===The Gaullist Fifth Republic (1958\u20131972)===\nIn 1958, the PCF was the only major party which was homogeneous in its opposition to [[Charles de Gaulle]]'s return to power and the foundation of the [[French Fifth Republic]]. The PCF regarded de Gaulle as a right-wing autocrat with fascist tendencies, and it had been the sworn enemy of [[Gaullism]] since 1946. However, given the widespread support for de Gaulle's return to power and the Fifth Republic, the PCF was more marginalized and isolated than ever. The NO vote in the [[1958 French constitutional referendum|referendum on the new constitution]] in September 1958 obtained only 20%. In the [[1958 French legislative election|1958 legislative election]], the first under the new constitution, the PCF won only 18.9% and 10 seats. It was badly penalized by the new [[two-round system]] in single-member constituencies, which makes it hard for parties without any electoral alliances or deals with other parties to win many seats.\n\nThe party faced internal dissent. [[Maoism]] became popular with some members of the party, leading to their exclusion from the PCF and the foundation of a small Maoist party in 1963. In the early 1960s, the authority of [[Maurice Thorez]] was challenged by some members of the Politburo. [[Laurent Casanova]] and [[Marcel Servin]] pleaded for a critique of [[Stalinism]] in the light of the 1956 [[On the Cult of Personality and Its Consequences|secret speech by Khrushchev]], and they considered the political positions of the Gaullists to be distinct from the [[Atlantism|atlantist]] line of the government of the [[French Fourth Republic]]. They were expelled from the Politburo.\n\nLittle by little, however, the PCF began to escape its political isolation and it was joined in opposition by centre-left and centrist parties. Furthermore, as political debate shifted away from the [[Algerian War]] towards socioeconomic issues, the PCF was able to recover lost supporters. In the [[1962 French legislative election|1962 legislative elections]], the PCF obtained 21.8% of the vote and 41 seats, a substantial recovery aided by mutual withdrawal deals with the SFIO and other left-wing parties in the runoffs (which had not been the case in 1958).\n\nIn the mid-1960s the [[U.S. State Department]] estimated the party membership to be approximately 260,000 (0.9% of the working age population of France).<ref>Benjamin, Roger W.; Kautsky, John H. \"[https://www.jstor.org/stable/1953329 Communism and Economic Development]\", ''[[American Political Science Review]]'', Vol. 62, No. 1. (Mar. 1968), pp. 122.</ref>\n\nSome months before his death, in 1964, Thorez handed over the leadership of the PCF to [[Waldeck Rochet]]. The new secretary-general advocated a left-wing coalition against [[Charles de Gaulle]], a reform of the party doctrine (the thesis of the unique party was abandoned). During this time, [[Georges Marchais]] gained prominence within the party, after his election to the Politburo in 1961.\n\nIn the [[1965 French presidential election|1965 presidential election]], on the belief that a PCF candidate would not be able to do well, the PCF supported the left-wing candidacy of [[Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand]], a former minister of the [[French Fourth Republic]] who was opposed to De Gaulle's regime since 1958. Mitterrand had never been a member of the SFIO (he was the leader of the small [[Convention of Republican Institutions]], CIR) and he enjoyed good relations with all left-wing parties including the PCF and the SFIO. The PCF also signed an electoral agreement with the [[Federation of the Democratic and Socialist Left]] (FGDS) prior to the [[1967 French legislative election|1967 legislative election]]. Mitterrand obtained 44.8% in the runoff. The PCF won 22.5% and 73 seats.\n\nIn [[May 1968 in France|May 1968]] widespread student riots and strikes broke out in France. The PCF initially supported the general strike but opposed the revolutionary student movement, which was dominated by [[Trotskyism|Trotskyists]], [[Maoism|Maoists]] and [[anarchists]], and the so-called \"[[new social movements]]\" (including [[environmentalists]], gay movements, prisoners' movement). [[Georges Marchais]], in ''L'Humanit\u00e9'' on May 3, virulently denounced the leaders of the movement in an article entitled \"False revolutionaries who must be exposed\". He referred to student leader [[Daniel Cohn-Bendit]] as the \"German anarchist\".<ref>[http://www.assemblee-nationale.fr/histoire/mai_68/article_georges-marchais_030568.asp Mai 68 et ses suites l\u00e9gislatives imm\u00e9diates : Article de Georges Marchais, L'Humanit\u00e9 (3 mai 1968)] [[French National Assembly]] website, accessed 19 March 2013</ref><ref>Buton, Philippe and Laurent Gervereau, ''Le Couteau entre les dents : 70 ans d'affiches communistes et anticommunistes'', \u00c9ditions du Ch\u00eane, 1989, p. 41</ref> Although the PCF and the CGT were compelled by their base to join the movement as it expanded to take the form of a general strike, the PCF feared that it would be overwhelmed by events - especially as some on the left, led by Mitterrand were attempting to use [[Charles de Gaulle]]'s initial vacillations to create a political alternative to the Gaullist regime. It welcomed Prime Minister [[Georges Pompidou]]'s willingness to dialogue and it supported the [[Grenelle agreements]]. When de Gaulle regained the initiative over the situation on 30 May, by announcing the dissolution of the [[French National Assembly|National Assembly]] and snap elections, the PCF quickly embraced the President's decision.\n\nHowever, the PCF\u2014and the left as a whole\u2014suffered very heavy losses in the [[1968 French legislative election|1968 legislative elections]] which saw a Gaullist landslide. The PCF won 20% of the vote and lost over half its seat, holding only 34 in the new legislature.\n\nIn terms of foreign policy, under [[Waldeck Rochet]]'s leadership, the PCF slowly and incompletely distanced itself from the Soviet Union. During the [[Prague Spring]], it pleaded for conciliation, then it expressed its surprise and disapproval about the Soviet intervention\u2014but it never firmly condemned it. Nevertheless, the PCF publicly criticized  a Soviet action for the first time in its history. This event caused frictions in the Politburo: Jeannette Vermersch, Thorez's widow, resigned.\n\nFollowing [[Charles de Gaulle]]'s resignation after he lost a [[1969 French constitutional referendum|referendum]] on constitutional reforms, an early [[1969 French presidential election|presidential election]] was held in June 1969. Because of Waldeck Rochet's ill health, senator and party elder [[Jacques Duclos]] was the party's candidate. The collapse of the FGDS after 1968 and Mitterrand's temporary fall from grace after his actions in May 1968 broke up the PCF's alliance with the left. Indeed, it was impossible for the PCF to support the SFIO's candidate, [[Marseille]] mayor [[Gaston Defferre]], an anti-communist who governed his city in coalition with the centrists. As Defferre's candidacy rapidly foundered, Duclos, buoyed by his amiability and personal popularity, rose in the polls. Duclos won 21.3%, placing third but completely eclipsing Defferre (5%), the [[Unified Socialist Party (France)|PSU]]'s [[Michel Rocard]] (3.6%) and [[Revolutionary Communist League (France)|Trotskyist]] leader [[Alain Krivine]] (1.1%). Eliminated by the first round, the PCF refused to endorse either [[Gaullism|Gaullist]] candidate [[Georges Pompidou]] and the centrist caretaker President [[Alain Poher]] in the runoff, considering that they were two sides of the same coin (''blanc bonnet ou bonnet blanc''). Pompidou won easily, with 58.2%, but most PCF voters did not vote: abstention increased from 22.4% in the first round to 31.2% in the second round.\n\nIn 1970, [[Roger Garaudy]], a member of the Central Committee of the PCF from 1945 on, was expelled from the party for his [[Marxist revisionism|revisionist tendencies]], being criticized for his attempt to reconcile Marxism with [[Roman Catholicism]]. From 1982 onwards, Garaudy emerged as a major [[Holocaust denial|Holocaust denier]] and was officially convicted in 1998.\n\n===The Common Programme, the union of the left and decline (1972\u20131981)===\nIn 1972 Waldeck Rochet was succeeded as secretary-general by [[Georges Marchais]], who had effectively controlled the party since 1970. Marchais began a moderate liberalization of the party's policies and internal life, although dissident members, particularly intellectuals, continued to be expelled. The PCF formed an alliance with Mitterrand's new [[French Socialist Party|Socialist Party]] (PS). They signed a ''Common Programme'' before the [[1973 French legislative election|1973 legislative election]]. The Common Programme marked the PCF's acceptance of democratic principles and civil liberties, and included major institutional, economic and social reforms.<ref>{{Citation |first1=Br\u00e9chon |last1=Pierre|title=Les partis politiques fran\u00e7ais |publisher=La documentation fran\u00e7aise |year=2011 |page=157}}</ref> The PCF believed, like in 1936, that it would gain the upper hand over the PS and quickly decimate their socialist rivals. On the contrary, however, the PCF was weakened by the alliance with the PS. In the [[1973 French legislative election|1973 elections]], the PCF increased its support\u2014winning 21.4% and 73 seats\u2014but the distance separating it from the PS was reduced, with Mitterrand's PS winning 19.2%.\n\nNominally the French communists supported Mitterrand's Common Programme candidacy in [[1974 French presidential election|1974 presidential election]], but the Soviet ambassador in Paris and the director of ''[[L'Humanit\u00e9]]'' did not hide their satisfaction with Mitterrand's narrow defeat at the hands of centre-right candidate [[Val\u00e9ry Giscard d'Estaing]]. According to [[Jean Lacouture]], [[Raymond Aron]] and [[Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand]] himself, the Soviet government and the French communist leaders had done everything in order to prevent Mitterrand from being elected: they regarded him as too [[anti-communism|anti-communist]] and too skillful in his strategy of re-balancing the Left.\n\nAs Giscard became increasingly unpopular, the left swept midterm local elections\u2014the [[1976 French cantonal elections|1976 cantonal elections]] and the [[1977 French municipal elections|1977 municipal elections]], which allowed the PCF to strengthen its base in local government. But these elections also confirmed the PCF's slow decline: in the 1976 cantonal elections, the PS (26.6%) obtained more votes than the PCF (22.8%) for the first time since 1936.\n\nInternally, the PCF sought to respond to the growing international denunciation of Soviet communism, which followed the Prague uprising (1968) and the publication of [[Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn]]'s book ''[[The Gulag Archipelago]]'' in 1973. In 1976, the PCF dropped references to the [[dictatorship of the proletariat]], affirmed its independence vis-a-vis Moscow and endorsed democratic liberties\u2014although it did not drop revolutionary rhetoric. In ''L'Humanit\u00e9'' in January 1976, for example, the party spoke of a \"democratic and revolutionary way [...] to socialism\" and \"taking into account conditions of our time in favour of the forces of progress, liberty and peace\". The PCF's goal was the \"transformation of the capitalist society into a socialist society, a fraternal society without exploiters or exploited\".<ref>''[[L'Humanit\u00e9]]'', 20 January 1976</ref> The PCF began to follow a line closer to that of the [[Italian Communist Party]]'s [[eurocommunism]]. However, this was only a relative change of direction, as the PCF remained largely loyal to Moscow, and in 1979, [[Georges Marchais]] supported the [[Soviet\u2013Afghan War|Soviet invasion of Afghanistan]]. Its assessment of the Soviet and Eastern European communist governments was \"positive overall\".\n\nDuring Mitterrand's term as PS first secretary, the PS re-emerged as the dominant party of the left. Worried about these trends, Marchais demanded updates to the Common Programme, but the negotiations failed, ending the union of the left. The PS accused Marchais of being responsible for the division of the left and of its defeat at the [[1978 French legislative election|1978 legislative election]]. In the 1978 election, for the first time in a legislative election since 1936, the PCF was surpassed by the PS as the largest party on the left (20.6% for the PCF, 22.6% for the PS). Nonetheless, the PCF won 86 seats.\n\nMarchais was the party's candidate in the [[1981 French presidential election|1981 presidential election]], facing off against, among others, Giscard and Mitterrand. The PCF envisioned the 1981 election as the opportunity for it to regain its leadership of the left, and it was encouraged by Marchais' rising poll numbers (from 15% to 19%). He ran a populist campaign, which attacked the PS\u2014in particular its alleged shift to the right\u2014as much as the incumbent right-wing President. Marchais' attacks on Mitterrand were often so harsh that many Socialists felt that Marchais was playing into Giscard's hands by attacking Mitterrand. To counter such accusations, Marchais proclaimed himself as the \"anti-Giscard candidate\" and, late into his campaign, attacked the incumbent as the \"president of injustice\".<ref>Becker, Jean-Jacques, ''Nouvelle Histoire de la France contemporaine : Crises et alternances (1974\u20132000)'', t. 19, Paris: Seuil, 2002. p. 229</ref>\n\nThe election was a massive disaster for the PCF. Marchais won only 15.4% in the first round, in fourth place. Reluctantly, Marchais endorsed Mitterrand in the runoff, facilitating Mitterrand's narrow victory with 51.8% on 10 May 1981.\n\n===Ephemeral governmental experience and decline (1981\u20131994)===\n{{Further|French Fifth Republic | France in the twentieth century}}\n[[File:Georges Marchais.JPG|thumb|Georges Marchais, leader 1972-1994]]\nThe [[1981 French legislative election|snap legislative election]] in June 1981 was another major setback for the PCF, which marked the end of the PCF's dreams of regaining leadership of the left. A number of PCF supporters had already defected to the PS and Mitterrand by the first round of the presidential election, and the party was unable to stop the bleeding. In the legislative elections, the PCF won only 16.2% of the vote and 44 seats, a far cry from the PS' 285 seats.\n\nAfter the legislative elections, the PCF obtained cabinet positions in [[Pierre Mauroy]]'s new government, their first cabinet participation since 1947. The four Communist ministers were [[Charles Fiterman]] (transportation), [[Anicet Le Pors]] (Public sector), [[Jack Ralite]] (health) and [[Marcel Rigout]] (professional development). Although some on the right worried about the PCF's participation in government and decried the PS' alliance with the PCF, Mitterrand outmaneuvered the PCF at every turn. As the government's initial leftist [[Keynesian]] economic policies proved unsuccessful, with rising unemployment and deindustrialization. Between 1982 and 1983, PS finance minister [[Jacques Delors]] changed course in favour of orthodox fiscal and economic policies and austerity measures (''rigueur \u00e9conomique'').\n\nIn the [[1982 French cantonal elections|1982 cantonal elections]], the PCF won only 15.9% and lost 45 general councillors. It suffered more losses in the [[1983 French municipal elections|1983 municipal elections]]. The party suffered another major defeat in the [[1984 European Parliament election in France|1984 European elections]], in which [[Georges Marchais]]' PCF list won only 11.2%, closely followed by the far-right [[National Front (France)|National Front]] (FN) which broke through to win 11%. In July 1984, with [[Laurent Fabius]] replacing Mauroy as Prime Minister, the PCF resigned from the government. The PCF joined the ranks of the opposition, largely abstaining in the National Assembly.\n\nThe PCF fell under another symbolic threshold in the [[1986 French legislative election|1986 legislative election]], winning only 9.8% and 35 seats. But Marchais refused to budge, and the PCF remained loyal to Moscow until the end.\n\nThe PCF leadership imposed [[Andr\u00e9 Lajoinie]]'s candidacy in the [[1988 French presidential election|1988 presidential election]], despite the opposition of the moderate \"renewers\" led by [[Pierre Juquin]] who advocated in favour of [[eurocommunism]] and [[eco-socialism]]. Juquin ran as a dissident against the PCF's official candidate, receiving support from small far-left (Trotskyist), red green/eco socialist and [[New Left]] movements. Lajoinie, a poor candidate, obtained only 6.8% while Juquin took 2.1%. The PCF, however, had a brief respite in the subsequent [[1988 French legislative election|1988 legislative election]], in which it managed 11.3% but lost more seats, winning only 27. Between 1988 and 1993, the PCF did not participate in PS governments, but offered piecemeal case-by-case parliamentary support to the PS. The [[1989 European Parliament election in France|1989 European elections]] marked another low for the PCF, whose list won only 7.7% and elected 7 MEPs.\n\nThe Communists were unable to benefit from President Mitterrand and the PS' unpopularity after 1991\u20131992. In the [[1993 French legislative election|1993 legislative elections]], marked by a monumental defeat of the PS, the PCF won only 9.3% and 24 seats.\n\nThe [[fall of the Soviet Union]] in 1991 led to a crisis in the PCF, but it did not follow the example of some other European communist parties by dissolving itself or changing its name. At the XXVIII<sup>th</sup> Congress in 1994, Marchais stepped down as secretary-general in favour of [[Robert Hue]].\n\n===Renewal, recovery and collapse (1994\u20132002)===\n[[Robert Hue]] sought to transform and renew the party. In his book ''Communisme : la mutation'', he condemned the Soviet Union, in particular its rejection of individualism, human rights and liberal democracy.<ref name=\"Les partis politiques fran\u00e7ais\">{{Citation |first1=Br\u00e9chon |last1=Pierre|title=Les partis politiques fran\u00e7ais |publisher=La documentation fran\u00e7aise |year=2011 |page=174}}</ref> Under Hue the party embarked on a process called ''la mutation''. ''La mutation'' included the thorough reorganization of party structure and move away from [[Marxist-Leninist]] dogma. [[Democratic centralism]] was abandoned, the leadership structures revamped and renamed and public criticism of the party line was allowed with the formation of party factions. This move was intended to revitalize the PCF and attract non-affiliated leftists to the party. However, it largely failed to stop the party's decline.\n\nIn the [[1995 French presidential election|1995 presidential election]], Hue managed an acceptable 8.6%, a result superior to Lajoinie's 1988 result but inferior to Lajoinie and Juquin's combined support in 1988.\n\nUnder Hue's leadership, the PCF also renewed its alliance with other left-wing forces, primarily the PS, as part of the [[Plural Left]] (''Gauche plurielle'') coalition. In the [[1997 French legislative election|1997 legislative election]], the PCF enjoyed a brief recovery, winning 9.9% and 35 seats. Under [[Lionel Jospin]]'s left-wing government between 1997 and 2002, the PCF returned to government with [[Jean-Claude Gayssot]] as [[Minister of Transportation (France)|Minister of Transportation]]; [[Marie-George Buffet]] as Minister of Youth and Sports; Michelle Demessine (later Jacques Brunhes) as secretary of state for tourism; and, after 2000, Michel Duffour as secretary of state for heritage and cultural decentralization.\n\n[[File:Manif Paris 2005-11-19 dsc06238.jpg|thumb|During a street protest in 2005 in Paris]]\nThe PCF's brief recovery proved short lived. The party became riddled with internal conflict, as many sectors - notably the \"orthodox\" faction - opposed ''la mutation'' and the policy of co-governing with the Socialists. In the [[1999 European Parliament election in France|1999 European election]], the PCF list, despite its attempt to open to social movements and non-communist activists, won only 6.8% and 6 MEPs. 1999 was followed by the [[2002 French presidential election|2002 presidential elections]], in which Hue won only 3.4% in the first round. For the first time, the PCF candidate obtained fewer votes than the Trotskyist candidates ([[Arlette Laguiller]] and [[Olivier Besancenot]]), and by virtue of falling under 5% its campaign expenses were not reimbursed by the state.\n\nIn the [[2002 French legislative election|2002 legislative elections]], the PCF won only 4.8% of the vote and 21 seats. Hue himself lost his seat in [[Argenteuil (Val-d'Oise)|Argenteuil]].\n\nHue had already resigned the party's leadership in October 2001 to [[Marie-George Buffet]] and was completely sidelined from the party after the 2002 rout.\n\n===Attempts to stop the decline (2002\u20132008)===\nUnder Buffet's leadership after 2003, the PCF shifted away from the PS and Hue's ''mutation''. Instead, it attempted to actively reach out to and embrace social movements, trade unions and non-communist activists as a strategy to counter the PCF's decline. The party sought to create a broader alliance including 'anti-liberal' and [[anti-capitalist]] actors from civil society or trade unions.\n\nOne of the shifts in the PCF's strategy after 2003 came in the form of a more militant [[Euroscepticism]] (in 2001, the PCF had only abstained rather than voted against the [[Treaty of Nice]] while they were in government). As such, in 2005, the PCF played a leading role in the left-wing NO campaign in the [[2005 French European Constitution referendum|referendum]] on the [[Treaty establishing a Constitution for Europe]] (TCE). The victory of the NO vote, along with a campaign against the [[Bolkestein directive]], earned the party some positive publicity.\n\nIn 2005, a labour conflict at the [[SNCM]] in [[Marseille]], followed by a 4 October 2005 demonstration against the [[New Employment Contract]] (CNE) marked the opposition to [[Dominique de Villepin]]'s right-wing government; Villepin shared his authority with [[Nicolas Sarkozy]], who, as Minister of the Interior and leader of the right-wing [[Union for a Popular Movement]] (UMP) was a favourite for the [[2007 French presidential election|upcoming presidential election]]. [[Marie-George Buffet]] also criticized the government's response to the [[2005 civil unrest in France|fall 2005 riots]], speaking of a deliberate \"[[strategy of tension]]\" employed by Sarkozy, who had called the youth from the [[housing projects]] \"scum\" (''racaille'') which needed to be cleaned up with a [[K\u00e4rcher]] high pressure hose. While most of the Socialist deputies voted for the declaration of a [[state of emergency]] during the riots, which lasted until January 2006, the PCF, along with the [[The Greens (France)|Greens]], opposed it.\n\nIn 2006, the PCF and other left-wing groups supported [[2006 labour protests in France|protests against the First Employment Contract]], which finally forced president Chirac to scrap plans for the bill, aimed at creating a more flexible [[labour and employment law|labour law]].\n\nNevertheless, the PCF's new strategy did not bring about a major electoral recovery. In the [[2004 French regional elections|2004 regional elections]], the PCF ran some independent lists in the first round - some of them expanded to civil society actors, like [[Marie-George Buffet]]'s list in [[\u00cele-de-France]]. The results were rather positive for the party, which won nearly 11% in [[Nord-Pas-de-Calais]] and [[Picardy]], 9% in [[Auvergne (region)|Auvergne]] and 7.2% in [[\u00cele-de-France]]. In the [[2004 French cantonal elections|2004 cantonal elections]], the PCF won 7.8% nationally and 108 seats; a decent performance, although it was below the party's result in previous cantonal elections in 2001 (9.8%) and 1998 (10%). The PCF did poorly in the [[2004 European Parliament election in France|2004 European elections]], winning only 5.88% and only 2 out of 78 seats.\n\nThe new strategy, likewise, also faced internal resistance on two fronts: on the one hand from the party's traditionalist and [[Marxist-Leninist]] \"orthodox\" faction and from the ''refondateurs''/''r\u00e9novateurs'' (\"refounders\" or \"rebuilders\") who wanted to create a united front with parties and movements on the left of the PS.\n\nBuoyed by the success of the left-wing NO campaign in 2005, the PCF and other left-wing ''nonistes'' from 2005 attempted to create \"anti-liberal collectives\" which could run a common 'anti-liberal left' candidate in the [[2007 French presidential election|2007 presidential election]]. Buffet, backed by the PCF (except for the ''r\u00e9fondateurs''), proposed her candidacy and emerged as the winner in most preparatory votes organized by these collective structures. However, the entire effort soon fell into disarray before collapsing completely. The far-left - represented by [[Oliver Besancenot]] ([[Revolutionary Communist League (France)|Revolutionary Communist League]]) and [[Arlette Laguiller]] ([[Workers' Struggle]]) was unwilling to participate in the efforts to begin with, preferring their own independent candidacies. [[Jos\u00e9 Bov\u00e9]], initially a supporter of the anti-liberal collectives, later withdrew from the process and announced his independent candidacy. The PCF's leadership and members voted in favour of maintaining Buffet's candidacy, despite the failure of the anti-liberal collectives and called on other left-wing forces to support her candidacy. This support was not forthcoming, and after a low-key campaign she won only 1.93%, even lower than Robert Hue's 3.4% in the previous presidential election. Once again, the low result meant that the PCF did not meet the 5% threshold for reimbursement of its campaign expenses.\n\nThe presidential rout was followed by an equally poor performance in the [[2007 French legislative election|subsequent legislative elections]], in which it won only 4.3% of the vote and 15 seats. Having fallen the 20-seat threshold to form its own group in the National Assembly, the PCF was compelled to ally itself with [[The Greens (France)|The Greens]] and other left-wing MPs to form a parliamentary group, called [[Democratic and Republican Left group]] (GDR). The PCF's poor showing in 2007 weighed a lot on its budget.<ref>[https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/main.jhtml?xml=/news/2007/06/10/wfrance110.xml Cash-strapped Communists hawk treasures], ''[[The Daily Telegraph|The Telegraph]]'', 10 June 2007</ref>\n\n[[File:French Communist Party meeting in Paris 2012 (34).JPG|thumb|French Communist Party in Paris 2012]]\nIn the [[2008 French municipal elections|2008 municipal elections]], the PCF fared better than expected but nevertheless had contrasted results overall. It gained [[Dieppe, Seine-Maritime|Dieppe]], [[Saint-Claude, Jura|Saint Claude]], [[Firminy]] and [[Vierzon]] as well as other smaller towns and kept most of its large towns, such as [[Arles]], [[Bagneux, Hauts-de-Seine|Bagneux]], [[Bobigny]], [[Champigny-sur-Marne]], [[Echirolles]], [[Fontenay-sous-Bois]], [[Gardanne]], [[Gennevilliers]], [[Givors]], [[Malakoff]], [[Martigues]], [[Nanterre]], [[Stains, Seine-Saint-Denis|Stains]] and [[Venissieux]]. However, the PCF lost some key [[communes of France|communes]] in the second round, such as [[Montreuil, Seine-Saint-Denis|Montreuil]], [[Aubervilliers]] and particularly [[Calais]], where an UMP candidate ousted the PCF after 37 years. In the [[2008 French cantonal elections|cantonal elections]] on the same day, the PCF won 8.8% and 117 seats, a small increase on the 2004 results.\n\n===Left Front (2009\u2013present)===\n[[File:Marie-George Buffet Front de Gauche 2009-03-08.jpg|thumb|Marie-George Buffet at the launch of the FG, 2009]]\nThe PCF, to counter its slow decline, sought to build a broader electoral coalition with other (smaller) left-wing or far-left parties. In October 2008, and again at the PCF's XXXIV Congress in December 2008, the PCF issued a call for the creation of a \"civic and progressive front\".<ref>[http://www.pcf.fr/spip.php?article3186 R\u00e9solution du Conseil national pour les \u00e9lections europ\u00e9ennes] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090207041813/http://www.pcf.fr/spip.php?article3186 |date=2009-02-07}} on the PCF website</ref>{{,}}<ref>[http://www.pcf.fr/spip.php?article3314 ''CommunisteS'' #332]{{dead link|date=November 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes}} on the PCF website</ref> The [[Left Party (France)|Left Party]] (PG), led by PS dissident [[Jean-Luc M\u00e9lenchon]], and other small parties including the [[United Left (France)|United Left]] responded positively to the call, forming the [[Left Front (France)|Left Front]] (''Front de gauche'', FG), at first for the [[2009 European Parliament election in France|2009 European Parliament election]]. The FG has since turned into a permanent electoral coalition, extended for the [[2010 French regional elections|2010 regional elections]], [[2011 French cantonal elections|2011 cantonal elections]], [[2012 French presidential election|2012 presidential election]] and the [[2012 French legislative election|2012 legislative election]].\n\nThe FG allowed the PCF to halt its decline, but perhaps with a price. The FG won 6.5% in the 2009 European elections, 5.8% in the 2010 regional elections and 8.9% in the 2011 cantonal elections. However, paying the price of its greater electoral and political independence vis-a-vis the PS, it fell from 185 to 95 regional councillors after the 2010 elections.\n\nNevertheless, the FG strategy caused further tension and even dissent within PCF ranks. Up to the higher echelons of the PCF leadership, some were uneasy with M\u00e9lenchon's potential candidacy in the [[2012 French presidential election|2012 presidential election]] and the PCF disagreed with M\u00e9lenchon's PG on issues such as participation in PS-led regional executives.<ref>[http://www.leparisien.fr/flash-actualite-politique/regionales-les-elus-pg-ne-participeront-pas-aux-executifs-regionaux-26-03-2010-864535.php R\u00e9gionales : les \u00e9lus PG ne participeront pas aux ex\u00e9cutifs r\u00e9gionaux], ''[[Le Parisien]]'', 26 March 2010</ref> In 2010, a number of leading ''r\u00e9fondateurs'' within the PCF ([[Patrick Braouezec]], [[Jacqueline Fraysse]], [[Fran\u00e7ois Asensi]], [[Roger Martelli]]...) left the party to join the small [[Federation for a Social and Ecological Alternative]] (FASE).\n\n[[File:Pierre-Laurent.jpg|thumb|Pierre Laurent, current party leader]]\nAt the PCF's XXXV Congress in 2010, Buffet stepped down in favour of [[Pierre Laurent (politician)|Pierre Laurent]], a former journalist.\n\nIn 2010, the PCF played a leading role in the protests against [[\u00c9ric Woerth]]'s pension reform, which raised the [[retirement age]] by two years.\n\nOn 5 June 2011, the PCF's national delegates approved, with 63.6% against, a resolution which included an endorsement of M\u00e9lenchon's candidacy as the FG's candidate in the [[2012 French presidential election|2012 presidential election]]. A few days later, on 16\u201318 June, an internal primary open to all PCF members was held, ratifying M\u00e9lenchon's candidacy. M\u00e9lenchon's candidacy for the FG, the position endorsed by the PCF leadership, won 59%.

Nevertheless, the PCF - which made up the bulk of FG incumbents and candidates - faced a strong challenge from the PS in its strongholds in the first round, and, unexpectedly, found a number of its incumbents place behind the PS candidate in the first round. Applying the traditional rule of \"mutual withdrawal\", FG/PCF candidates who won fewer votes than another left-wing candidates withdrew from the runoff. As a result, the FG was left with only 10 seats - 7 of those for the PCF. It was the PCF's worst seat count in its entire history.\n\nDespite this defeat, the PCF leadership remains supportive of the FG strategy.

It originated when a majority of members resigned from the socialist [[French Section of the Workers' International]] (SFIO) party to set up the French Section of the Communist International (SFIC). The SFIO had been divided over support for French participation in [[World War I]] and over whether to join the [[Communist International]] (Comintern). The new SFIC defined itself as [[revolution]]ary and [[democratic centralism|democratic centralist]]. [[Ludovic-Oscar Frossard]] was its first secretary-general, and [[Ho Chi Minh]] was also among the founders. Frossard himself resigned in 1923, and the 1920s saw a number of splits within the party over relations with other left-wing parties and over adherence to the Communist International's dictates. The party gained representation in the [[Chamber of Deputies (France)|French parliament]] in successive elections, but also promoted strike action and opposed [[colonialism]]. [[Pierre S\u00e9mard]], leader from 1924 to 1928, sought party unity and alliances with other parties; but leaders including [[Maurice Thorez]] (party leader from 1930 to 1964) imposed a [[Stalinist]] line from the late 1920s, leading to loss of membership through splits and expulsions, and reduced electoral success. With the rise of [[Fascism]] this policy shifted after 1934, and the PCF supported the [[Popular Front (France)|Popular Front]], which came to power under [[L\u00e9on Blum]] in 1936. The party helped to secure French support for the Spanish [[Spanish Second Republic|Republicans]] during the [[Spanish Civil War]], and opposed the 1938 [[Munich Accords|Munich agreement]] with Hitler. During this period the PCF adopted a more patriotic image, and favoured an equal but distinct role for women in the communist movement.\n\nThe party was banned in 1939 on the outbreak of [[World War II]]. Under Comintern direction the PCF opposed the war and may have sabotaged arms production. The leadership, threatened with execution, fled abroad. After the German invasion of 1940 the party failed to persuade the occupiers to legalise its activities, and while denouncing the war as a struggle between imperialists, began to organise opposition to the occupation. When [[German invasion of the Soviet Union|Germany invaded the Soviet Union]] the next year, the Comintern declared Germany to be an enemy, and the PCF expanded its anti-German activities, forming the [[National Front (French Resistance)|National Front]] movement within the broader [[French Resistance|Resistance]] and organising direct action and political assassinations through the armed ''[[Francs-Tireurs et Partisans]]'' (FTP) group. At the same time the PCF began to work with [[Charles de Gaulle|de Gaulle]]'s \"[[Free France]]\", the London-based government in exile, and later took part in the [[National Council of the Resistance]] (CNR).\n\nBy the time the [[liberation of France|German occupation ended]] in 1944, the party had become a powerful force in many parts of France. It was among the leading parties in elections in 1945 and 1946, and entered into the governing [[Tripartisme|Tripartite]] alliance with the socialist SFIO and the Christian democratic [[Popular Republican Movement|MRP]]. The Tripartite governments pursued social reforms and [[statism]]. However, amid concerns within France and abroad over the extent of communist influence, the PCF was excluded from government in May 1947. Under pressure from Moscow, the PCF thereafter distanced itself from other parties and focussed on agitation within its trade union base. For the rest of the [[French Fourth Republic|Fourth Republic]] period the PCF, led by Thorez and [[Jacques Duclos]], remained politically isolated, still taking a Stalinist line, though retaining substantial electoral support.\n\nAlthough the PCF opposed de Gaulle's formation of the [[French Fifth Republic|Fifth Republic]] in 1958, the following years saw a ''rapprochement'' with other left-wing forces and an increased strength in parliament. With [[Waldeck Rochet]] as its new secretary-general, the party supported [[Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand]]'s unsuccessful presidential bid in 1965 and started to move apart to a limited extent from the Soviet Union. During the student riots and strikes of [[May 1968 in France|May 1968]], the party supported the strikes while denouncing the revolutionary student movements. After heavy losses in the ensuing parliamentary elections, the party adopted [[Georges Marchais]] as leader and in 1973 entered into a \"Common Programme\" alliance with Mitterrand's reconstituted [[French Socialist Party|Socialist Party]] (PS). Under the Common Programme, however, the PCF steadily lost ground to the PS, a process that continued after Mitterrand's victory in 1981.\n\nInitially allotted a minor share in Mitterrand's government, the PCF resigned in 1984 as the government turned towards fiscal orthodoxy. Under Marchais the party continued loyal to the Soviet Union up to its fall in 1991, and made little move towards \"[[Eurocommunism]]\". Extensive reform of the party's structure and policies had to wait until 1994, when [[Robert Hue]] became leader. The party's renunciation of much traditional communist dogma after this did little to stem its declining popularity, although it entered government again in 1997 as part of the [[Plural Left]] coalition. Elections in 2002 gave worse results than ever for the PCF, now led by [[Marie-George Buffet]]. Under Buffet, the PCF turned away from parliamentary strategy and sought broader social alliances. It condemned the [[Nicolas Sarkozy]] government's response to [[2005 civil unrest in France|riots in 2005]] and adopted a more militant stance towards the [[European Union]]. Buffet's attempt to stand in the [[2007 French presidential election|2007 presidential election]] as a common candidate of the \"anti-liberal left\" had little success. To maintain a presence in parliament after 2007 the party's few remaining deputies had to group together with those from [[The Greens (France)|The Greens]] and others to create the [[Democratic and Republican Left group]] (GDR). Subsequently, a broader electoral coalition, the [[Left Front (France)|Left Front]] (FG), was formed including the PCF, [[Jean-Luc M\u00e9lenchon]]'s [[Left Party (France)|Left Party]] (PG), [[United Left (France)|United Left]], and others. The FG has continued up to the present and has brought the French communists somewhat better electoral results, at the price of some tension within the party and with other parties in the FG. With [[Pierre Laurent (politician)|Pierre Laurent]] as leader since 2010, in a symbolic move the party no longer includes the [[hammer and sickle]] logo on its membership cards.\n\n== Foundation ==\n\nThe French Communist Party was founded in December 1920 by a split in the socialist [[French Section of the Workers' International]] (SFIO), led by the majority of party members who supported membership in the [[Communist International]] (or \"Comintern\") founded in 1919 by [[Lenin]] after the [[Bolshevik Revolution]] in [[Russia]].\n\nThe outbreak of [[World War I]] in 1914 sparked tensions within the SFIO, when a majority of the SFIO took what left-wing socialists called a \"[[social-chauvinist]]\" line in support of the French war effort. Gradually, anti-war factions gained in influence in the party and [[Ludovic-Oscar Frossard]] was elected general secretary in October 1918. Additionally, the success of the [[Bolshevik Revolution]] in [[Russia]] aroused hope for a similar communist revolution in France among some SFIO members.\n\nAfter the war, the issue of membership in the new [[Communist International]] became a major issue for the SFIO. In the spring of 1920, Frossard and [[Marcel Cachin]], director of the party newspaper ''[[L'Humanit\u00e9]]'', were commissioned to meet with Bolshevik leaders in Russia. They observed the second congress of the [[Communist International]], during the course of which [[Vladimir Lenin]] set out the 21 conditions for membership. When they returned, Frossard and Cachin recommended that the party join the Communist International.\n\nAt the SFIO's [[Tours Congress]] in December 1920, this opinion was supported  by the left-wing faction ([[Boris Souvarine]], [[Fernand Loriot]]) and the 'centrist' faction ([[Ludovic-Oscar Frossard]], [[Marcel Cachin]]), but opposed by the right-wing faction ([[L\u00e9on Blum]]). This majority option won three quarters of the votes from party members at the congress. The pro-Comintern majority founded a new party, known as the French Section of the Communist International (''Section fran\u00e7aise de l'Internationale communiste'', SFIC), which accepted the strict conditions for membership.\n\nA majority of socialist parliamentarians and local officeholders were opposed to membership, particularly because of the Communist International's strict [[democratic centralism]] and its denunciation of [[Parliamentary system|parliamentarianism]]. These members went on to form a rump SFIO, which had a much smaller membership than the SFIC but which could count on a strong base of officeholders and parliamentarians.\n\nThe founders of the SFIC took with them the party paper ''[[L'Humanit\u00e9]]'', founded by [[Jean Jaur\u00e8s]] in 1904, which remained tied to the party until the 1990s. In the [[General Confederation of Labour (France)|General Confederation of Labour]] (CGT) trade unions, the Communist minority split away to form the [[United General Confederation of Labour]] (CGTU) in 1922.\n\nThe new communist party defined itself as a revolutionary party, which used legal as well as clandestine or illegal means. The party organization was run under strict democratic centralist precepts, until the 1990s: the minority factions were compelled to follow the majority faction, any organized factions or contrary opinions were forbidden, while membership was tightly controlled and dissidents often purged from the party.\n\n[[Ho Chi Minh]], who would create the [[Viet Minh]] in 1941 and then declare the independence of [[Vietnam]], was one of its founding members.<ref name=\"ho\">{{cite book |title=Ho Chi Minh: A Life |url=https://archive.org/details/hochiminh00duik |url-access=registration |last=Duiker |first=William J. |authorlink=William J.

Entitled ''The truth about the colonies'', the first section was dedicated to abuses committed during the colonial conquests, and quoted [[Albert Londres]]' and [[Andr\u00e9 Gide]]'s criticisms of [[forced labour]] while the second one contrasted the Soviet policy on nationalities with 'imperialist colonialism'.]] -->\n\nIn its early years, as the communists fought the SFIO for control of the French left, the new party was weakened and marginalized by a series of splits and expulsions.\n\nThe \"bolshevization\" or [[Stalinism|stalinization]] imposed by the [[Communist International]], as well as [[Grigory Zinoviev|Zinoviev]]'s power over the Communist International, led to internal crises. \"Bolshevization\" implied not only the adoption of the political strategy of the [[Communist International]] but a reorganization of party's structure on the model of the Bolsheviks (discipline, local organization under the shape of \"cells\", ascent of a young political staff which came from the working-class).\n\nThe first secretary-general of the PCF, [[Ludovic-Oscar Frossard]], was often reluctant to obey the directives of the [[Communist International]]. Indeed, the party leadership was opposed to the strategy of the \"proletarian unique front\". Furthermore, one of Frossard's internal opponents, [[Boris Souvarine]], was a member of the secretariat of the [[Communist International]]. Frossard resigned and left the PCF in 1923 to found a dissident United Communist Party which later became the Communist Socialist Party (but Frossard himself rejoined the SFIO). The general secretariat of the Party was shared by [[Louis Sellier]] (center faction) and [[Albert Treint]] (left-wing faction). At the same time, Boris Souvarine was expelled from the [[Communist International]] and the PCF due to his sympathy for [[Leon Trotsky]].\n\nIn the [[1924 French legislative election|1924 legislative election]], the PCF won 9.8% of the vote and 26 seats, considerably weaker than the SFIO. But under the leadership of the left-wing faction, priority was given to general strikes and revolutionary actions rather than elections. In the French Parliament, the PCF's first elected deputies were opposed to the ''[[Cartel des Gauches]]'' coalition formed by the SFIO and the [[Radical-Socialist Party (France)|Radical Party]], which governed between 1924 and 1926.\n\nIn order to reconcile the various factions of the party, [[Pierre S\u00e9mard]], railroad worker and union activist, was chosen as the new secretary-general. He wanted to put an end to sectarianism, which was criticized by communist officeholders and leaders of the CGTU. Most notably, he proposed alliances with other left-wing parties (including the SFIO) in order to combat fascism. This strategy was criticized by the board of the [[Communist International]] as \"parliamentarist\". At the same time, the party campaigned against French colonialism in [[Morocco]] (the [[Rif War]]), leading to the detention of some PCF members, including S\u00e9mard. On his release from prison, he became more and more controversial. Only 11 PCF candidates were elected in the [[Chamber of Deputies (France)|Chamber of Deputies]] in the [[1928 French legislative election|1928 election]], although the PCF increased its support to 11%.\n\nIn 1927, in the [[Soviet Union]], [[Josef Stalin]] sidelined his opponents ([[Grigory Zinoviev|Zinoviev]], [[Kamenev]] and [[Leon Trotsky]]) and imposed a strict \"class against class\" line on the Communist International. In France, a Stalinist committee took control of the PCF . Its most influential figures came from the Communist Youth, notably [[Henri Barb\u00e9]] and [[Pierre C\u00e9lor]]. They applied the \"class against class\" political line of the [[Communist International]], denouncing social democracy and the SFIO as akin to bourgeois parties. Simultaneously, the new leadership purged dissidents, like [[Louis Sellier]], former secretary-general, who created the [[Worker and Peasant Party]], which merged with the [[Communist Socialist Party]] to form the [[Proletarian Unity Party (France)|Party of Proletarian Unity]] (PUP). By the end of the 1920s, the party contained fewer than 30,000 members.\n\nThe collegial leadership of the party was divided between young leaders and more experienced politicians. The secretary for organization, [[Maurice Thorez]], was chosen as the new secretary-general in 1930. In 1931, Barb\u00e9 and Celor were accused of responsibility for excesses in the \"class against class\" strategy. Nonetheless, the strategy was continued.\n\nIndeed, the [[Wall Street Crash of 1929]] and the [[Great Depression of 1929|Great Depression]], which affected France beginning in 1931, caused much anxiety and disturbance, as in other countries. As [[economic liberalism]] failed, many were eagerly looking for new solutions. [[Technocracy (bureaucratic)|Technocratic]] ideas were born during this time (''[[Groupe X-Crise]]''), as well as [[autarky]] and [[corporatism]] in the fascist movement, which advocated union of workers and employers. Some members were attracted to these new ideas, most notably [[Jacques Doriot]]. A member of the presidium of the Executive Committee of the Comintern from 1922 onwards, and from 1923 onwards the secretary of the French Federation of Young Communists, later elected to the French [[Chamber of Deputies (France)|Chamber of Deputies]] from [[Saint-Denis, Seine-Saint-Denis|Saint-Denis]], he came to advocate an alliance between the Communists and SFIO. Doriot was then expelled in 1934, and with his followers. Afterwards he moved sharply to the right and formed the [[French Popular Party]], which would be one of the most [[collaborationism|collaborationist]] parties during the [[Vichy France|Vichy regime]].\n\nThe PCF was the main organizer of a counter-exhibition to the [[1931 Colonial Exhibition in Paris]], called \"The Truth about the Colonies\". In the first section, it recalled [[Albert Londres]] and [[Andr\u00e9 Gide]]'s critics of [[forced labour]] in the colonies and other crimes of the [[New Imperialism]] period; in the second section, it contrasted [[imperialism|imperialist]] [[colonialism]] to \"the Soviets' policy on nationalities\". In 1934 the [[Tunisia]]n Federation of the PCF became the [[Tunisian Communist Party]].<ref>Gilberg, Trond. ''Coalition Strategies Of Marxist Parties''. [[Durham, North Carolina|Durham]]: Duke University Press, 1989. p. 256</ref>\n\nThe PCF suffered substantial losses in the [[1932 French legislative election|1932 election]], winning only 8% of the vote and 10 seats. The 1932 election saw the victory of another ''Cartel des gauches''. This time, although the PCF did not participate in the coalition, it supported the government from the outside (''soutien sans participation''), similar to how the Socialists, prior to the First World War, had supported republican and Radical governments without participating.\n\nThe Communist Party attracted various intellectuals and [[French art of the 20th century|artists in the 1920s]], including [[Andr\u00e9 Breton]], the leader of the [[surrealism|Surrealist]] movement, [[Henri Lefebvre]] (who would be expelled in 1958), [[Paul \u00c9luard]], [[Louis Aragon]], and others.\n\n==The Popular Front (1934\u20131939)==\n\n{{Main|Popular Front (France)}}\nThis second Cartel coalition fell following the far-right [[6 February 1934 riots]], which forced Radical Prime Minister [[\u00c9douard Daladier]] to cede power to the conservative [[Gaston Doumergue]]. Following this crisis, the PCF, like the whole of the socialist movement, feared that France was on the verge of fascist takeover. [[Adolf Hitler]]'s rise to power in 1933 and the destruction of the [[Communist Party of Germany]] following the 27 February 1933 [[Reichstag fire]] led Moscow and Stalin to change course, and adopt the  [[popular front]] strategy whereby communists were to form anti-fascist coalitions with their erstwhile socialist and bourgeois enemies. [[Maurice Thorez]] spearheaded the formation of an alliance with the SFIO, and later the [[Popular Front (France)|Popular Front]] in 1936.\n\nDuring the Popular Front era (after 1934) the PCF rapidly grew in size and influence, its growth fueled by the popularity of the Comintern's [[Popular Front]] strategy, which allowed an anti-fascist [[Popular Front (France)|alliance]] with the SFIO and the [[Radical Party (France)|Radical Party]]. The PCF made substantial gains in the 1934 cantonal elections and established themselves as the dominant political force in working-class municipalities surrounding [[Paris]] (the Red Belt) in the 1935 municipal elections.\n\nThe Popular Front won the [[1936 French legislative election|1936 elections]]; the PCF itself made major gains - taking 15.3% and 72 seats. SFIO leader [[L\u00e9on Blum]] formed a Socialist-Radical government, supported from the outside by the PCF. However, the Popular Front government soon collapsed under the strains of domestic financial problems (including inflation) and foreign policy issues (the radicals opposed intervention in the [[Spanish Civil War]] while the socialists and communists were in favour), and was replaced by a moderate government led by [[\u00c9douard Daladier]].\n\nAs the only major communist party in western Europe that was still legal, the PCF played a major role in supporting the [[Spanish Second Republic]] during the [[Spanish Civil War]], alongside the Soviet Union. Blum's government officially maintained a neutral policy of non-intervention, but in practice his government ensured the safe passage of aid and Soviet weapons to the besieged Spanish republicans. The PCF often played a major role in such actions, and it sent a number of French volunteers to fight for the republicans in the [[International Brigades]]. At the end of the conflict, the PCF organized humanitarian aid for Spanish refugees.\n\nThe PCF's 72 deputies (along with only three others) opposed the ratification of the [[Munich Accords]], signed by Daladier and [[Neville Chamberlain]]. The PCF believed that the accords would allow Hitler to turn his attention eastwards, towards the Soviet Union.\n\nOn 12 August 1936, a party organization was formed in [[Madagascar]], the [[Communist Party (French Section of the Communist International) of the Region of Madagascar]].<ref>Thomas, Martin.

Above all the Communists portrayed themselves as French nationalists. Young Communists dressed in costumes from the revolutionary period and the scholars glorified the Jacobins as heroic predecessors.<ref>Jessica Wardhaugh, \"Fighting for the Unknown Soldier: The Contested Territory of the French Nation in 1934-1938,\" ''Modern and Contemporary France'' (2007) 15#2 pp  185-201.</ref>\n\nThe Communists in the 1920s saw the need to mobilize young women, but saw them as auxiliaries to male organizations.  In the 1930s there was a new model, of a separate but equal role for women. The Party set up the Union des Jeunes Filles de France (UJFF) to appeal to young working women through publications and activities geared to their interests. The Party discarded its original notions of Communist femininity and female political activism as a gender-neutral revolutionary. It issued a new model more attuned to the mood of the late 1930s and one more acceptable to the middle class elements of the Popular Front. It now portrayed the ideal Young Communist as a paragon of moral probity with her commitment to marriage and motherhood, and gender-specific public activism.<ref>Susan B. Whitney, \"Embracing the status quo: French communists, young women and the popular front,\" ''Journal of Social History'' (1996) 30#1 pp 29-43, [https://www.jstor.org/stable/3789748 in JSTOR]</ref>\n\n==World War II (1939\u20131945)==\n\n{{Further|World War II|Vichy France}}\n\n===Before Operation Barbarossa (1939 \u2013 June 1941)===\nGermany and the Soviet Union signed the [[Molotov\u2013Ribbentrop Pact]] in August 1939, forming neutrality between both ideological rivals. The non-aggression pact between the Nazis and Moscow dismayed many French communists, a number of whom rejected the pact. A fifth of the PCF's caucus left the party, forming a dissident parliamentary group.\n\nShortly after France entered [[World War II]] in September 1939, the PCF was declared a proscribed organisation by [[\u00c9douard Daladier]]'s government. At first the PCF reaffirmed its commitment to national defense, but after the Comintern addressed French Communists by declaring the war to be 'imperialist', the party changed its stance. PCF parliamentarians signed a letter calling for peace and viewed Hitler's forthcoming peace proposals favourably. The Comintern ordered the PCF leadership to flee to [[Belgium]], while [[Maurice Thorez]], on [[Georgi Dimitrov]]'s orders, deserted the army and fled to Moscow in order to escape prosecution. The PCF became a clandestine organization, at first rather disorganized.<ref>{{Cite book|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=3IeGuqVcUGIC&pg=PA121&lpg=PA121&dq=french+communist+party+1940&source=bl&ots=CyNQSO7Vxa&sig=rDrm_uNBY6bdF-_bSkgARm077UM&hl=en&ei=4uYHSvTzMpGKtgOt3J3rAQ&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=5#PPA122,M1|title=Julian Jackson, The Fall of France: The Nazi Invasion of 1940}}</ref> In France, the government dissolved all Communist-led local administrations, cracked down on communist trade unionists and targeted the ''[[L'Humanit\u00e9]]'' newspaper.<ref>Courtois, St\u00e9phane ''Le PCF dans la guerre'', Ramsay, 1980, p.56\u201368</ref> The government decreed that any communist propaganda, assimilated to Nazi propaganda, would be punished by the [[death penalty]].\n\nDomestically, the PCF led anti-war actions, but although the party published pacifist propaganda for soldiers they stopped short of inciting desertion. The role of the PCF in alleged sabotage operations, against armaments plants, has been a point of debate among historians. In 1951, A. Rossi listed a number of sabotage operations initiated by the PCF against armaments factories throughout France,<ref>A. Rossi, ''Les communistes pendant la dr\u00f4le de guerre'', les Iles d'Or, 1951, r\u00e9\u00e9d \u00c9d. de l'Albatros, 1978</ref> but later historians have downplayed the PCF's role in any such actions, stating that they were isolated cases.<ref>Jean-Pierre Az\u00e9ma, ''De Munich \u00e0 la Lib\u00e9ration, 1938\u20131944'', Points Seuil, 1979, p. 46</ref>\n\nAfter the [[German invasion of France in 1940]] and the ensuing [[Nazi occupation of France]], the relationship between the Communists and the German occupiers fluctuated. The domestic leadership, led by [[Maurice Tr\u00e9and]] with the knowledge of [[Jacques Duclos]], petitioned the Germans to allow the republication of ''L'Humanit\u00e9'', which would take a neutral stance on the occupation. But these negotiations were a disaster for the party, as [[Hitler]] disavowed [[Otto Abetz]] and Vichy was successfully able to oppose the legalization of the PCF. Nevertheless, the PCF limited openly anti-German or anti-occupation actions and instead adopted virulently anti-British, anti-imperialist, anti-socialist and anti-Vichy/P\u00e9tain rhetoric which shied away from directly attacking the Nazi occupiers.<ref>Courtois, St\u00e9phane ''Le PCF dans la guerre'', Ramsay, 1980, p. 139-140</ref> In return, Otto Abetz would have allowed for the liberation of over 300 communist prisoners.<ref>Peschanski, Denis, ''Les avatars du communisme fran\u00e7ais de 1939 \u00e0 1941'' in ''La France des ann\u00e9es noires'', \u00e9ditions du Seuil, coll. Points, 1993, p. 446</ref> Moscow later denounced the attempts of the PCF to lobby the Germans for the party's legalization. In August 1940, a new policy categorically forbade any expressions of solidarity with the occupiers and limited interactions between the PCF and the occupiers.\n\nSimultaneously, however, many communists and PCF cells reorganized clandestinely and began organizing opposition to the Germans and [[Philippe P\u00e9tain]]'s regime in Vichy. One of the major actions organized by the PCF against the occupation forces was a demonstration of thousands of students and workers, staged in Paris on 11 November 1940. In May 1941, the PCF helped to organize more than 100,000 miners in the Nord and Pas-de-Calais departments in a strike. On 26 April 1941, the PCF called for a National Front for the independence of France with the Gaullists.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=okNGTtMQFL8C&pg=PA228&dq=26+April+1941+PCF&sig=ACfU3U0Rmy3GFL99E08jEkVt2Bxife5x9A|title=Matt Perry, Prisoners of Want}}</ref> The Vichy French police, and later the Germans, began to arrest and intern large number of communists.\n\n===Armed resistance (June 1941 \u2013 1945)===\n[[File:Logo Front National (ann\u00e9e 1945).png|thumb|National Front logo, 1945]]\nWhen [[German invasion of the Soviet Union|Germany invaded the Soviet Union in June 1941]], Stalin ordered all communists to engage in the armed struggle against the new Nazi enemy. The PCF expanded [[French Resistance|Resistance]] efforts within France notably advocating the use of direct action and political assassinations which had not been systematically organized up until this point. In August 1941, [[Pierre Georges]] (Colonel Fabien) shot and killed a German naval officer in the [[Paris m\u00e9tro]]. In October, the Germans stepped up reprisal actions, ordering the execution of 22 interned communists at [[Ch\u00e2teaubriant]] including the 17-year-old [[Guy M\u00f4quet]], later honoured as a hero of the resistance.\n\nBy late 1941 and early 1942, the PCF set up the ''[[Francs-Tireurs et Partisans]]'' (FTP), the armed faction of the communist-led [[National Front (French Resistance)|National Front]]. At the same time, with Moscow's blessing, the PCF engaged in talks with [[Charles de Gaulle]], the leader of [[Free France]] in [[London]]. The communists began cooperating with the Free French, all the while maintaining their distance from other resistance organizations in the north and the south\u2014remaining independent of the [[Mouvements Unis de la R\u00e9sistance|Unified Movements of the Resistance]] (MUR), the structure organized by [[Jean Moulin]] which organized the southern resistance. The National Front, PCF and CGT participated in the creation of the [[National Council of the Resistance]] (CNR) in May 1943.\n\nDuring this time period, the PCF was led by [[Jacques Duclos]] and [[Beno\u00eet Frachon]], operating out of the [[Hurepoix]] region in the [[Essonne]] department south of Paris. Under their leadership, the PCF maintained strong internal cohesion under centralized authority, which greatly boosted their power and influence within the resistance movement. In the regions, local communists played significant roles in spearheading the resistance. Most famously, the PCF activist [[Georges Guingouin]] organized and led the ''[[Maquis (World War II)|maquis]]'' in the [[Haute-Vienne]] ([[Limousin]]). Immigrant workers linked to the PCF partook in resistance operations through the [[FTP-MOI]] (''Francs-tireurs et partisans \u2013 main-d'\u0153uvre immigr\u00e9e'').\n\nBy 1944 the PCF had reached the height of its influence, and was powerful in large areas of the country through the Resistance units under its command. Some in the PCF wanted to launch a revolution as the Germans withdrew from the country, but the leadership, acting on Stalin's instructions, opposed this and adopted a policy of co-operating with the Allied powers and advocating a new Popular Front government. Many well-known figures joined the party during the war, including [[Pablo Picasso]], who joined the PCF in 1944.\n\n[[File:Vote-communiste-1945-2007.png|thumb|Share of vote at elections, 1945\u20132007]]\n\n==Provisional Government and the Fourth Republic (1945\u20131958)==\n{{Further|French Fourth Republic |France in the twentieth century}}\n\n===The PCF at its peak and the Tripartite governments (1945\u20131947)===\n\nThe Communists came out extraordinarily strengthened from the [[French Resistance|Resistance]], in terms of both organisation and prestige. With the [[liberation of France]] in 1944, the PCF, along with other resistance groups, entered the government of [[Charles de Gaulle]]. As in [[History of the Italian Republic|post-war Italy]], the communists were very popular and formed one of the major political forces in the country. The PCF was nicknamed the \"party of the 75,000 executed people\" (''le parti des 75 000 fusill\u00e9s'') because of its important role during the Resistance.\n\nBy the close of 1945 party membership stood at half a million, an enormous increase from its pre-Popular Front figure of less than thirty thousand. In the first post-war [[1945 French legislative election|elections]] for the unicameral interim Constituent National Assembly in October 1945, the PCF became the single largest party in France with 26.2% of the vote and 159 seats. In the [[June 1946 French legislative election|June 1946 elections]] for another constituent assembly, the PCF placed second but remained strong with 26% and 153 seats. In the [[November 1946 French legislative election|November 1946 elections]], which elected the first legislature of the new [[French Fourth Republic]], the PCF obtained its best result in its history \u2013 28.3% and 182 seats.\n\nBetween 1944 and May 1947, the PCF participated in governing coalitions. [[Maurice Thorez]] served in cabinet between November 1945 and May 1947, including a period as vice-president of the council of ministers between January 1946 and May 1947. The PCF was a core component of the [[Three-parties|Tripartite]] alliance with the [[French Section of the Workers' International]] (SFIO) and the [[Christian democracy|Christian democratic]] [[Popular Republican Movement]] (MRP) throughout this period. The tripartite governments under the provisional government (GPRF) and, after October 1946, the Fourth Republic, introduced a program of social reforms which laid the foundations of the French [[welfare state]]. This included the [[nationalization]] of strategic economic sectors ([[\u00c9lectricit\u00e9 de France|electricity]] (EDF) in 1946, the [[AGF (company)|AGF]] insurance firm, the [[Cr\u00e9dit Lyonnais]] bank in 1945 and the [[Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale]] bank in 1946, as well as the nationalization of the car maker [[Renault]]). [[Trade union]] independence was guaranteed by the 1946 [[Charter of Amiens]], a [[minimum wage]] established in 1947. This program comprised a substantial part of the so-called ''[[social rights|acquis sociaux]]'' (social rights) established in France during the second half of the twentieth century. Although the PCF were the largest party in most tripartite governments formed between 1945 and 1947, they never obtained the [[Prime Minister of France|presidency of the council of ministers]] and only rarely held strategic cabinet portfolios such as finance, defense or the interior. PCF cabinet ministers usually held the public health, armaments, reconstruction, industrial production and labour portfolios. ([[Ambroise Croizat]] was minister of labour between 1945 and 1947.\n\nThe PCF and socialists played a major role in drafting the proposed April 1946 constitution, but it was rejected by voters in a [[May 1946 French constitutional referendum|referendum]] in May 1946, with 53% against.\n\nThe party's strong electoral showing and surge in membership led some observers, including American under-secretary of state [[Dean Acheson]], to believe that a Communist takeover of France was imminent. A number of factors came to precipitate the expulsion of all PCF ministers from [[Paul Ramadier]]'s government in May 1947. Abroad, the PCF refused to vote war credits for the [[First Indochina War]] and the violent repression of the [[Madagascar insurrection]] by the SFIO government created strains with its coalition partners. The [[United States]] were worried of communist power in France and Italy, and conditioned [[Marshall Plan]] aid to the expulsion of communists from governments in both countries. Domestically, large-scale strikes broke out at [[Renault]] factories in April 1947. The PCF was finally expelled from government in May 1947, the same time as the [[Italian Communist Party]] (PCI) were expelled from the Italian government. The PCF responded with a series of strikes and sabotages.\n\n===Political isolation (1947\u20131956)===\n\nThe PCF remained isolated thereafter until [[Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand]]'s electoral victory in 1981. It thus began to pursue a more militant policy, alienating it SFIO and prompting divisions and tensions on the French left. The PCF fell back on its union activities, at a time when the PCF tightly controlled the [[General Confederation of Labour (France)|General Confederation of Labour]] (CGT), one of the largest and most militant unions in France.\n\nThe PCF, no longer restrained by the responsibilities of office, was free after 1947 to channel the widespread discontent among the working class with the poor economic performance of the new Fourth Republic. Furthermore, the PCF was under orders from Moscow to take a more radical course, reminiscent of the [[Third Period]] policy once pursued by the [[Comintern]]. In September 1947 several European Communist parties met in Szklarska Por\u0119ba in Poland, where a new international agency, the [[Cominform]], was set up. During this meeting [[Andrei Zhdanov]], standing in for [[Joseph Stalin]], denounced the 'moderation' of the French Communists and their excessive participation in 'bourgeois' parliamentary governments, even though this policy had been previously approved by Moscow.\n\nThe PCF denounced the administration as the tool of American [[capitalism]]. Following the arrest of some steel workers in [[Marseille]] in November 1947, the CGT called a strike, as PCF activists attacked the town hall and other 'bourgeois' targets in the city. When the protests spread to Paris, and as many as 3 million workers joined the strike, Ramadier resigned.\n\nThis development was prevented by the determination of [[Robert Schuman]], the new Prime Minister, and [[Jules Moch]], his Minister of the Interior. It was also prevented by a growing sense of disquiet among sections of the labour movement with PCF tactics, which included the derailment in early December 1947 of the Paris-Tourcoing Express, which left twenty-one people dead. Sensing a change of mood, the CGT leadership backed down and called off the strikes. From this point forward the PCF moved into permanent opposition and political isolation, a large but impotent presence in French politics.\n\nThe party remained tightly controlled by Thorez, Duclos and Frachon (although the latter focused his activities on the CGT). Thorez remained secretary-general and uncontested leader of the PCF until his death in 1964, but he suffered [[hemiplegia]] in 1950 and was often in Moscow for treatment. Duclos, in his absence, became the ''de facto'' leader of the PCF. Under Duclos' leadership, potential rivals ([[Andr\u00e9 Marty]] and [[Charles Tillon]]) were sidelined and [[Auguste Lec\u0153ur]], a rising star, was purged from the party in 1954.\n\nThe PCF remained a loyally Stalinist party throughout the period, and the PCF opposed the de-stalinization process begun by Moscow and other communist parties after Stalin's death in 1953. The PCF strongly supported the [[Soviet invasion of Hungary]] in 1956. A split occurred as [[Maoism|Maoists]] left during the late 1950s. Some moderate communist intellectuals, such as historian [[Emmanuel Le Roy Ladurie]], disillusioned with the policies of the Soviet Union, left the party after the violent suppression of [[Hungarian Revolution of 1956]].\n\nThe PCF suffered losses in the [[1951 French legislative election|1951 election]], winning 26.3% of the vote and 103 seats - a loss of 79 seats. The PCF and the [[Gaullist]] [[Rally of the French People]] (RPF) were sidelined and marginalized by the new governing coalition, the [[Third Force (France)|Third Force]] (a SFIO-Radical-MRP alliance). The Third Force's changes to the electoral law before the 1951 election were designed to weaken the PCF and RPF. Hence, the PCF lost 79 seats and won fewer seats than the SFIO (107) although it had 26.3% of the vote against only 15.4% for the SFIO. The PCF won 25.4% and 150 seats in the [[1956 French legislative election|1956 election]]. The PCF remained in opposition throughout this period, but as a major parliamentary force they contributed to the governmental instability of the Fourth Republic.\n\n[[Jean-Paul Sartre]], a \"comrade\" of the Communist party, actively supported the [[National Liberation Front (Algeria)|National Liberation Front]] (FLN) (the [[Jeanson network|''porteurs de valises'' networks]], in which [[Henri Curiel]] took part). Long debates took place on the role of [[conscription]]. While this stance by the PCF may have helped it retain widespread popularity in metropolitan France, it lost it credibility on the radical left. Nevertheless, during his scholarship to study radio engineering in Paris (from 1949 to 1953), [[Pol Pot]], like many other colonials educated in France (e.g. [[Ho Chi Minh]] in 1920), joined the French Communist Party.\n\nIn 1959 the PCF federation in [[R\u00e9union]] was separated from the party, and became the [[Reunionese Communist Party]].<ref>Gilberg, Trond. ''Coalition Strategies Of Marxist Parties''. [[Durham, North Carolina|Durham]]: Duke University Press, 1989. p. 265</ref>\n\n==Fifth Republic (1958\u2013present)==\n{{Further|French Fifth Republic |France in the twentieth century}}\n\n===The Gaullist Fifth Republic (1958\u20131972)===\nIn 1958, the PCF was the only major party which was homogeneous in its opposition to [[Charles de Gaulle]]'s return to power and the foundation of the [[French Fifth Republic]]. The PCF regarded de Gaulle as a right-wing autocrat with fascist tendencies, and it had been the sworn enemy of [[Gaullism]] since 1946. However, given the widespread support for de Gaulle's return to power and the Fifth Republic, the PCF was more marginalized and isolated than ever. The NO vote in the [[1958 French constitutional referendum|referendum on the new constitution]] in September 1958 obtained only 20%. In the [[1958 French legislative election|1958 legislative election]], the first under the new constitution, the PCF won only 18.9% and 10 seats. It was badly penalized by the new [[two-round system]] in single-member constituencies, which makes it hard for parties without any electoral alliances or deals with other parties to win many seats.\n\nThe party faced internal dissent. [[Maoism]] became popular with some members of the party, leading to their exclusion from the PCF and the foundation of a small Maoist party in 1963. In the early 1960s, the authority of [[Maurice Thorez]] was challenged by some members of the Politburo. [[Laurent Casanova]] and [[Marcel Servin]] pleaded for a critique of [[Stalinism]] in the light of the 1956 [[On the Cult of Personality and Its Consequences|secret speech by Khrushchev]], and they considered the political positions of the Gaullists to be distinct from the [[Atlantism|atlantist]] line of the government of the [[French Fourth Republic]]. They were expelled from the Politburo.\n\nLittle by little, however, the PCF began to escape its political isolation and it was joined in opposition by centre-left and centrist parties. Furthermore, as political debate shifted away from the [[Algerian War]] towards socioeconomic issues, the PCF was able to recover lost supporters. In the [[1962 French legislative election|1962 legislative elections]], the PCF obtained 21.8% of the vote and 41 seats, a substantial recovery aided by mutual withdrawal deals with the SFIO and other left-wing parties in the runoffs (which had not been the case in 1958).\n\nIn the mid-1960s the [[U.S. State Department]] estimated the party membership to be approximately 260,000 (0.9% of the working age population of France).<ref>Benjamin, Roger W.; Kautsky, John H. \"[https://www.jstor.org/stable/1953329 Communism and Economic Development]\", ''[[American Political Science Review]]'', Vol. 62, No. 1. (Mar. 1968), pp. 122.</ref>\n\nSome months before his death, in 1964, Thorez handed over the leadership of the PCF to [[Waldeck Rochet]]. The new secretary-general advocated a left-wing coalition against [[Charles de Gaulle]], a reform of the party doctrine (the thesis of the unique party was abandoned). During this time, [[Georges Marchais]] gained prominence within the party, after his election to the Politburo in 1961.\n\nIn the [[1965 French presidential election|1965 presidential election]], on the belief that a PCF candidate would not be able to do well, the PCF supported the left-wing candidacy of [[Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand]], a former minister of the [[French Fourth Republic]] who was opposed to De Gaulle's regime since 1958. Mitterrand had never been a member of the SFIO (he was the leader of the small [[Convention of Republican Institutions]], CIR) and he enjoyed good relations with all left-wing parties including the PCF and the SFIO. The PCF also signed an electoral agreement with the [[Federation of the Democratic and Socialist Left]] (FGDS) prior to the [[1967 French legislative election|1967 legislative election]]. Mitterrand obtained 44.8% in the runoff. The PCF won 22.5% and 73 seats.\n\nIn [[May 1968 in France|May 1968]] widespread student riots and strikes broke out in France. The PCF initially supported the general strike but opposed the revolutionary student movement, which was dominated by [[Trotskyism|Trotskyists]], [[Maoism|Maoists]] and [[anarchists]], and the so-called \"[[new social movements]]\" (including [[environmentalists]], gay movements, prisoners' movement). [[Georges Marchais]], in ''L'Humanit\u00e9'' on May 3, virulently denounced the leaders of the movement in an article entitled \"False revolutionaries who must be exposed\". He referred to student leader [[Daniel Cohn-Bendit]] as the \"German anarchist\".<ref>[http://www.assemblee-nationale.fr/histoire/mai_68/article_georges-marchais_030568.asp Mai 68 et ses suites l\u00e9gislatives imm\u00e9diates : Article de Georges Marchais, L'Humanit\u00e9 (3 mai 1968)] [[French National Assembly]] website, accessed 19 March 2013</ref><ref>Buton, Philippe and Laurent Gervereau, ''Le Couteau entre les dents : 70 ans d'affiches communistes et anticommunistes'', \u00c9ditions du Ch\u00eane, 1989, p. 41</ref> Although the PCF and the CGT were compelled by their base to join the movement as it expanded to take the form of a general strike, the PCF feared that it would be overwhelmed by events - especially as some on the left, led by Mitterrand were attempting to use [[Charles de Gaulle]]'s initial vacillations to create a political alternative to the Gaullist regime. It welcomed Prime Minister [[Georges Pompidou]]'s willingness to dialogue and it supported the [[Grenelle agreements]]. When de Gaulle regained the initiative over the situation on 30 May, by announcing the dissolution of the [[French National Assembly|National Assembly]] and snap elections, the PCF quickly embraced the President's decision.\n\nHowever, the PCF\u2014and the left as a whole\u2014suffered very heavy losses in the [[1968 French legislative election|1968 legislative elections]] which saw a Gaullist landslide. The PCF won 20% of the vote and lost over half its seat, holding only 34 in the new legislature.\n\nIn terms of foreign policy, under [[Waldeck Rochet]]'s leadership, the PCF slowly and incompletely distanced itself from the Soviet Union. During the [[Prague Spring]], it pleaded for conciliation, then it expressed its surprise and disapproval about the Soviet intervention\u2014but it never firmly condemned it. Nevertheless, the PCF publicly criticized  a Soviet action for the first time in its history. This event caused frictions in the Politburo: Jeannette Vermersch, Thorez's widow, resigned.\n\nFollowing [[Charles de Gaulle]]'s resignation after he lost a [[1969 French constitutional referendum|referendum]] on constitutional reforms, an early [[1969 French presidential election|presidential election]] was held in June 1969. Because of Waldeck Rochet's ill health, senator and party elder [[Jacques Duclos]] was the party's candidate. The collapse of the FGDS after 1968 and Mitterrand's temporary fall from grace after his actions in May 1968 broke up the PCF's alliance with the left. Indeed, it was impossible for the PCF to support the SFIO's candidate, [[Marseille]] mayor [[Gaston Defferre]], an anti-communist who governed his city in coalition with the centrists. As Defferre's candidacy rapidly foundered, Duclos, buoyed by his amiability and personal popularity, rose in the polls. Duclos won 21.3%, placing third but completely eclipsing Defferre (5%), the [[Unified Socialist Party (France)|PSU]]'s [[Michel Rocard]] (3.6%) and [[Revolutionary Communist League (France)|Trotskyist]] leader [[Alain Krivine]] (1.1%). Eliminated by the first round, the PCF refused to endorse either [[Gaullism|Gaullist]] candidate [[Georges Pompidou]] and the centrist caretaker President [[Alain Poher]] in the runoff, considering that they were two sides of the same coin (''blanc bonnet ou bonnet blanc''). Pompidou won easily, with 58.2%, but most PCF voters did not vote: abstention increased from 22.4% in the first round to 31.2% in the second round.\n\nIn 1970, [[Roger Garaudy]], a member of the Central Committee of the PCF from 1945 on, was expelled from the party for his [[Marxist revisionism|revisionist tendencies]], being criticized for his attempt to reconcile Marxism with [[Roman Catholicism]]. From 1982 onwards, Garaudy emerged as a major [[Holocaust denial|Holocaust denier]] and was officially convicted in 1998.\n\n===The Common Programme, the union of the left and decline (1972\u20131981)===\nIn 1972 Waldeck Rochet was succeeded as secretary-general by [[Georges Marchais]], who had effectively controlled the party since 1970. Marchais began a moderate liberalization of the party's policies and internal life, although dissident members, particularly intellectuals, continued to be expelled. The PCF formed an alliance with Mitterrand's new [[French Socialist Party|Socialist Party]] (PS). They signed a ''Common Programme'' before the [[1973 French legislative election|1973 legislative election]]. The Common Programme marked the PCF's acceptance of democratic principles and civil liberties, and included major institutional, economic and social reforms.<ref>{{Citation |first1=Br\u00e9chon |last1=Pierre|title=Les partis politiques fran\u00e7ais |publisher=La documentation fran\u00e7aise |year=2011 |page=157}}</ref> The PCF believed, like in 1936, that it would gain the upper hand over the PS and quickly decimate their socialist rivals. On the contrary, however, the PCF was weakened by the alliance with the PS. In the [[1973 French legislative election|1973 elections]], the PCF increased its support\u2014winning 21.4% and 73 seats\u2014but the distance separating it from the PS was reduced, with Mitterrand's PS winning 19.2%.\n\nNominally the French communists supported Mitterrand's Common Programme candidacy in [[1974 French presidential election|1974 presidential election]], but the Soviet ambassador in Paris and the director of ''[[L'Humanit\u00e9]]'' did not hide their satisfaction with Mitterrand's narrow defeat at the hands of centre-right candidate [[Val\u00e9ry Giscard d'Estaing]]. According to [[Jean Lacouture]], [[Raymond Aron]] and [[Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand]] himself, the Soviet government and the French communist leaders had done everything in order to prevent Mitterrand from being elected: they regarded him as too [[anti-communism|anti-communist]] and too skillful in his strategy of re-balancing the Left.\n\nAs Giscard became increasingly unpopular, the left swept midterm local elections\u2014the [[1976 French cantonal elections|1976 cantonal elections]] and the [[1977 French municipal elections|1977 municipal elections]], which allowed the PCF to strengthen its base in local government. But these elections also confirmed the PCF's slow decline: in the 1976 cantonal elections, the PS (26.6%) obtained more votes than the PCF (22.8%) for the first time since 1936.\n\nInternally, the PCF sought to respond to the growing international denunciation of Soviet communism, which followed the Prague uprising (1968) and the publication of [[Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn]]'s book ''[[The Gulag Archipelago]]'' in 1973. In 1976, the PCF dropped references to the [[dictatorship of the proletariat]], affirmed its independence vis-a-vis Moscow and endorsed democratic liberties\u2014although it did not drop revolutionary rhetoric. In ''L'Humanit\u00e9'' in January 1976, for example, the party spoke of a \"democratic and revolutionary way [...] to socialism\" and \"taking into account conditions of our time in favour of the forces of progress, liberty and peace\". The PCF's goal was the \"transformation of the capitalist society into a socialist society, a fraternal society without exploiters or exploited\".<ref>''[[L'Humanit\u00e9]]'', 20 January 1976</ref> The PCF began to follow a line closer to that of the [[Italian Communist Party]]'s [[eurocommunism]]. However, this was only a relative change of direction, as the PCF remained largely loyal to Moscow, and in 1979, [[Georges Marchais]] supported the [[Soviet\u2013Afghan War|Soviet invasion of Afghanistan]]. Its assessment of the Soviet and Eastern European communist governments was \"positive overall\".\n\nDuring Mitterrand's term as PS first secretary, the PS re-emerged as the dominant party of the left. Worried about these trends, Marchais demanded updates to the Common Programme, but the negotiations failed, ending the union of the left. The PS accused Marchais of being responsible for the division of the left and of its defeat at the [[1978 French legislative election|1978 legislative election]]. In the 1978 election, for the first time in a legislative election since 1936, the PCF was surpassed by the PS as the largest party on the left (20.6% for the PCF, 22.6% for the PS). Nonetheless, the PCF won 86 seats.\n\nMarchais was the party's candidate in the [[1981 French presidential election|1981 presidential election]], facing off against, among others, Giscard and Mitterrand. The PCF envisioned the 1981 election as the opportunity for it to regain its leadership of the left, and it was encouraged by Marchais' rising poll numbers (from 15% to 19%). He ran a populist campaign, which attacked the PS\u2014in particular its alleged shift to the right\u2014as much as the incumbent right-wing President. Marchais' attacks on Mitterrand were often so harsh that many Socialists felt that Marchais was playing into Giscard's hands by attacking Mitterrand. To counter such accusations, Marchais proclaimed himself as the \"anti-Giscard candidate\" and, late into his campaign, attacked the incumbent as the \"president of injustice\".<ref>Becker, Jean-Jacques, ''Nouvelle Histoire de la France contemporaine : Crises et alternances (1974\u20132000)'', t. 19, Paris: Seuil, 2002. p. 229</ref>\n\nThe election was a massive disaster for the PCF. Marchais won only 15.4% in the first round, in fourth place. Reluctantly, Marchais endorsed Mitterrand in the runoff, facilitating Mitterrand's narrow victory with 51.8% on 10 May 1981.\n\n===Ephemeral governmental experience and decline (1981\u20131994)===\n{{Further|French Fifth Republic | France in the twentieth century}}\n[[File:Georges Marchais.JPG|thumb|Georges Marchais, leader 1972-1994]]\nThe [[1981 French legislative election|snap legislative election]] in June 1981 was another major setback for the PCF, which marked the end of the PCF's dreams of regaining leadership of the left. A number of PCF supporters had already defected to the PS and Mitterrand by the first round of the presidential election, and the party was unable to stop the bleeding. In the legislative elections, the PCF won only 16.2% of the vote and 44 seats, a far cry from the PS' 285 seats.\n\nAfter the legislative elections, the PCF obtained cabinet positions in [[Pierre Mauroy]]'s new government, their first cabinet participation since 1947. The four Communist ministers were [[Charles Fiterman]] (transportation), [[Anicet Le Pors]] (Public sector), [[Jack Ralite]] (health) and [[Marcel Rigout]] (professional development). Although some on the right worried about the PCF's participation in government and decried the PS' alliance with the PCF, Mitterrand outmaneuvered the PCF at every turn. As the government's initial leftist [[Keynesian]] economic policies proved unsuccessful, with rising unemployment and deindustrialization. Between 1982 and 1983, PS finance minister [[Jacques Delors]] changed course in favour of orthodox fiscal and economic policies and austerity measures (''rigueur \u00e9conomique'').\n\nIn the [[1982 French cantonal elections|1982 cantonal elections]], the PCF won only 15.9% and lost 45 general councillors. It suffered more losses in the [[1983 French municipal elections|1983 municipal elections]]. The party suffered another major defeat in the [[1984 European Parliament election in France|1984 European elections]], in which [[Georges Marchais]]' PCF list won only 11.2%, closely followed by the far-right [[National Front (France)|National Front]] (FN) which broke through to win 11%. In July 1984, with [[Laurent Fabius]] replacing Mauroy as Prime Minister, the PCF resigned from the government. The PCF joined the ranks of the opposition, largely abstaining in the National Assembly.\n\nThe PCF fell under another symbolic threshold in the [[1986 French legislative election|1986 legislative election]], winning only 9.8% and 35 seats. But Marchais refused to budge, and the PCF remained loyal to Moscow until the end.\n\nThe PCF leadership imposed [[Andr\u00e9 Lajoinie]]'s candidacy in the [[1988 French presidential election|1988 presidential election]], despite the opposition of the moderate \"renewers\" led by [[Pierre Juquin]] who advocated in favour of [[eurocommunism]] and [[eco-socialism]]. Juquin ran as a dissident against the PCF's official candidate, receiving support from small far-left (Trotskyist), red green/eco socialist and [[New Left]] movements. Lajoinie, a poor candidate, obtained only 6.8% while Juquin took 2.1%. The PCF, however, had a brief respite in the subsequent [[1988 French legislative election|1988 legislative election]], in which it managed 11.3% but lost more seats, winning only 27. Between 1988 and 1993, the PCF did not participate in PS governments, but offered piecemeal case-by-case parliamentary support to the PS. The [[1989 European Parliament election in France|1989 European elections]] marked another low for the PCF, whose list won only 7.7% and elected 7 MEPs.\n\nThe Communists were unable to benefit from President Mitterrand and the PS' unpopularity after 1991-1992. In the [[1993 French legislative election|1993 legislative elections]], marked by a monumental defeat of the PS, the PCF won only 9.3% and 24 seats.\n\nThe [[fall of the Soviet Union]] in 1991 led to a crisis in the PCF, but it did not follow the example of some other European communist parties by dissolving itself or changing its name. At the XXVIII<sup>th</sup> Congress in 1994, Marchais stepped down as secretary-general in favour of [[Robert Hue]].\n\n===Renewal, recovery and collapse (1994\u20132002)===\n[[Robert Hue]] sought to transform and renew the party. In his book ''Communisme : la mutation'', he condemned the Soviet Union, in particular its rejection of individualism, human rights and liberal democracy.<ref name=\"Les partis politiques fran\u00e7ais\">{{Citation |first1=Br\u00e9chon |last1=Pierre|title=Les partis politiques fran\u00e7ais |publisher=La documentation fran\u00e7aise |year=2011 |page=174}}</ref> Under Hue the party embarked on a process called ''la mutation''. ''La mutation'' included the thorough reorganization of party structure and move away from [[Marxist-Leninist]] dogma. [[Democratic centralism]] was abandoned, the leadership structures revamped and renamed and public criticism of the party line was allowed with the formation of party factions. This move was intended to revitalize the PCF and attract non-affiliated leftists to the party. However, it largely failed to stop the party's decline.\n\nIn the [[1995 French presidential election|1995 presidential election]], Hue managed an acceptable 8.6%, a result superior to Lajoinie's 1988 result but inferior to Lajoinie and Juquin's combined support in 1988.\n\nUnder Hue's leadership, the PCF also renewed its alliance with other left-wing forces, primarily the PS, as part of the [[Plural Left]] (''Gauche plurielle'') coalition. In the [[1997 French legislative election|1997 legislative election]], the PCF enjoyed a brief recovery, winning 9.9% and 35 seats. Under [[Lionel Jospin]]'s left-wing government between 1997 and 2002, the PCF returned to government with [[Jean-Claude Gayssot]] as [[Minister of Transportation (France)|Minister of Transportation]]; [[Marie-George Buffet]] as Minister of Youth and Sports; Michelle Demessine (later Jacques Brunhes) as secretary of state for tourism; and, after 2000, Michel Duffour as secretary of state for heritage and cultural decentralization.\n\n[[File:Manif Paris 2005-11-19 dsc06238.jpg|thumb|During a street protest in 2005 in Paris]]\nThe PCF's brief recovery proved short lived. The party became riddled with internal conflict, as many sectors - notably the \"orthodox\" faction - opposed ''la mutation'' and the policy of co-governing with the Socialists. In the [[1999 European Parliament election in France|1999 European election]], the PCF list, despite its attempt to open to social movements and non-communist activists, won only 6.8% and 6 MEPs. 1999 was followed by the [[2002 French presidential election|2002 presidential elections]], in which Hue won only 3.4% in the first round. For the first time, the PCF candidate obtained fewer votes than the Trotskyist candidates ([[Arlette Laguiller]] and [[Olivier Besancenot]]), and by virtue of falling under 5% its campaign expenses were not reimbursed by the state.\n\nIn the [[2002 French legislative election|2002 legislative elections]], the PCF won only 4.8% of the vote and 21 seats. Hue himself lost his seat in [[Argenteuil (Val-d'Oise)|Argenteuil]].\n\nHue had already resigned the party's leadership in October 2001 to [[Marie-George Buffet]] and was completely sidelined from the party after the 2002 rout.\n\n===Attempts to stop the decline (2002\u20132008)===\nUnder Buffet's leadership after 2003, the PCF shifted away from the PS and Hue's ''mutation''. Instead, it attempted to actively reach out to and embrace social movements, trade unions and non-communist activists as a strategy to counter the PCF's decline. The party sought to create a broader alliance including 'anti-liberal' and [[anti-capitalist]] actors from civil society or trade unions.\n\nOne of the shifts in the PCF's strategy after 2003 came in the form of a more militant [[Euroscepticism]] (in 2001, the PCF had only abstained rather than voted against the [[Treaty of Nice]] while they were in government). As such, in 2005, the PCF played a leading role in the left-wing NO campaign in the [[2005 French European Constitution referendum|referendum]] on the [[Treaty establishing a Constitution for Europe]] (TCE). The victory of the NO vote, along with a campaign against the [[Bolkestein directive]], earned the party some positive publicity.\n\nIn 2005, a labour conflict at the [[SNCM]] in [[Marseille]], followed by a 4 October 2005 demonstration against the [[New Employment Contract]] (CNE) marked the opposition to [[Dominique de Villepin]]'s right-wing government; Villepin shared his authority with [[Nicolas Sarkozy]], who, as Minister of the Interior and leader of the right-wing [[Union for a Popular Movement]] (UMP) was a favourite for the [[2007 French presidential election|upcoming presidential election]]. [[Marie-George Buffet]] also criticized the government's response to the [[2005 civil unrest in France|fall 2005 riots]], speaking of a deliberate \"[[strategy of tension]]\" employed by Sarkozy, who had called the youth from the [[housing projects]] \"scum\" (''racaille'') which needed to be cleaned up with a [[K\u00e4rcher]] high pressure hose. While most of the Socialist deputies voted for the declaration of a [[state of emergency]] during the riots, which lasted until January 2006, the PCF, along with the [[The Greens (France)|Greens]], opposed it.\n\nIn 2006, the PCF and other left-wing groups supported [[2006 labour protests in France|protests against the First Employment Contract]], which finally forced president Chirac to scrap plans for the bill, aimed at creating a more flexible [[labour and employment law|labour law]].\n\nNevertheless, the PCF's new strategy did not bring about a major electoral recovery. In the [[2004 French regional elections|2004 regional elections]], the PCF ran some independent lists in the first round - some of them expanded to civil society actors, like [[Marie-George Buffet]]'s list in [[\u00cele-de-France]]. The results were rather positive for the party, which won nearly 11% in [[Nord-Pas-de-Calais]] and [[Picardy]], 9% in [[Auvergne (region)|Auvergne]] and 7.2% in [[\u00cele-de-France]]. In the [[2004 French cantonal elections|2004 cantonal elections]], the PCF won 7.8% nationally and 108 seats; a decent performance, although it was below the party's result in previous cantonal elections in 2001 (9.8%) and 1998 (10%). The PCF did poorly in the [[2004 European Parliament election in France|2004 European elections]], winning only 5.88% and only 2 out of 78 seats.\n\nThe new strategy, likewise, also faced internal resistance on two fronts: on the one hand from the party's traditionalist and [[Marxist-Leninist]] \"orthodox\" faction and from the ''refondateurs''/''r\u00e9novateurs'' (\"refounders\" or \"rebuilders\") who wanted to create a united front with parties and movements on the left of the PS.\n\nBuoyed by the success of the left-wing NO campaign in 2005, the PCF and other left-wing ''nonistes'' from 2005 attempted to create \"anti-liberal collectives\" which could run a common 'anti-liberal left' candidate in the [[2007 French presidential election|2007 presidential election]]. Buffet, backed by the PCF (except for the ''r\u00e9fondateurs''), proposed her candidacy and emerged as the winner in most preparatory votes organized by these collective structures. However, the entire effort soon fell into disarray before collapsing completely. The far-left - represented by [[Oliver Besancenot]] ([[Revolutionary Communist League (France)|Revolutionary Communist League]]) and [[Arlette Laguiller]] ([[Workers' Struggle]]) was unwilling to participate in the efforts to begin with, preferring their own independent candidacies. [[Jos\u00e9 Bov\u00e9]], initially a supporter of the anti-liberal collectives, later withdrew from the process and announced his independent candidacy. The PCF's leadership and members voted in favour of maintaining Buffet's candidacy, despite the failure of the anti-liberal collectives and called on other left-wing forces to support her candidacy. This support was not forthcoming, and after a low-key campaign she won only 1.93%, even lower than Robert Hue's 3.4% in the previous presidential election. Once again, the low result meant that the PCF did not meet the 5% threshold for reimbursement of its campaign expenses.\n\nThe presidential rout was followed by an equally poor performance in the [[2007 French legislative election|subsequent legislative elections]], in which it won only 4.3% of the vote and 15 seats. Having fallen the 20-seat threshold to form its own group in the National Assembly, the PCF was compelled to ally itself with [[The Greens (France)|The Greens]] and other left-wing MPs to form a parliamentary group, called [[Democratic and Republican Left group]] (GDR). The PCF's poor showing in 2007 weighed a lot on its budget.<ref>[https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/main.jhtml?xml=/news/2007/06/10/wfrance110.xml Cash-strapped Communists hawk treasures], ''[[The Daily Telegraph|The Telegraph]]'', 10 June 2007</ref>\n\n[[File:French Communist Party meeting in Paris 2012 (34).JPG|thumb|French Communist Party in Paris 2012]]\nIn the [[2008 French municipal elections|2008 municipal elections]], the PCF fared better than expected but nevertheless had contrasted results overall. It gained [[Dieppe, Seine-Maritime|Dieppe]], [[Saint-Claude, Jura|Saint Claude]], [[Firminy]] and [[Vierzon]] as well as other smaller towns and kept most of its large towns, such as [[Arles]], [[Bagneux, Hauts-de-Seine|Bagneux]], [[Bobigny]], [[Champigny-sur-Marne]], [[Echirolles]], [[Fontenay-sous-Bois]], [[Gardanne]], [[Gennevilliers]], [[Givors]], [[Malakoff]], [[Martigues]], [[Nanterre]], [[Stains, Seine-Saint-Denis|Stains]] and [[Venissieux]]. However, the PCF lost some key [[communes of France|communes]] in the second round, such as [[Montreuil, Seine-Saint-Denis|Montreuil]], [[Aubervilliers]] and particularly [[Calais]], where an UMP candidate ousted the PCF after 37 years. In the [[2008 French cantonal elections|cantonal elections]] on the same day, the PCF won 8.8% and 117 seats, a small increase on the 2004 results.\n\n===Left Front (2009\u2013present)===\n[[File:Marie-George Buffet Front de Gauche 2009-03-08.jpg|thumb|Marie-George Buffet at the launch of the FG, 2009]]\nThe PCF, to counter its slow decline, sought to build a broader electoral coalition with other (smaller) left-wing or far-left parties.

The FG has since turned into a permanent electoral coalition, extended for the [[2010 French regional elections|2010 regional elections]], [[2011 French cantonal elections|2011 cantonal elections]], [[2012 French presidential election|2012 presidential election]] and the [[2012 French legislative election|2012 legislative election]].\n\nThe FG allowed the PCF to halt its decline, but perhaps with a price. The FG won 6.5% in the 2009 European elections, 5.8% in the 2010 regional elections and 8.9% in the 2011 cantonal elections. However, paying the price of its greater electoral and political independence vis-a-vis the PS, it fell from 185 to 95 regional councillors after the 2010 elections.\n\nNevertheless, the FG strategy caused further tension and even dissent within PCF ranks. Up to the higher echelons of the PCF leadership, some were uneasy with M\u00e9lenchon's potential candidacy in the [[2012 French presidential election|2012 presidential election]] and the PCF disagreed with M\u00e9lenchon's PG on issues such as participation in PS-led regional executives.<ref>[http://www.leparisien.fr/flash-actualite-politique/regionales-les-elus-pg-ne-participeront-pas-aux-executifs-regionaux-26-03-2010-864535.php R\u00e9gionales : les \u00e9lus PG ne participeront pas aux ex\u00e9cutifs r\u00e9gionaux], ''[[Le Parisien]]'', 26 March 2010</ref> In 2010, a number of leading ''r\u00e9fondateurs'' within the PCF ([[Patrick Braouezec]], [[Jacqueline Fraysse]], [[Fran\u00e7ois Asensi]], [[Roger Martelli]]...) left the party to join the small [[Federation for a Social and Ecological Alternative]] (FASE).\n\n[[File:Pierre-Laurent.jpg|thumb|Pierre Laurent, current party leader]]\nAt the PCF's XXXV Congress in 2010, Buffet stepped down in favour of [[Pierre Laurent (politician)|Pierre Laurent]], a former journalist.\n\nIn 2010, the PCF played a leading role in the protests against [[\u00c9ric Woerth]]'s pension reform, which raised the [[retirement age]] by two years.\n\nOn 5 June 2011, the PCF's national delegates approved, with 63.6% against, a resolution which included an endorsement of M\u00e9lenchon's candidacy as the FG's candidate in the [[2012 French presidential election|2012 presidential election]]. A few days later, on 16\u201318 June, an internal primary open to all PCF members was held, ratifying M\u00e9lenchon's candidacy. M\u00e9lenchon's candidacy for the FG, the position endorsed by the PCF leadership, won 59%.

Nevertheless, the PCF - which made up the bulk of FG incumbents and candidates - faced a strong challenge from the PS in its strongholds in the first round, and, unexpectedly, found a number of its incumbents place behind the PS candidate in the first round. Applying the traditional rule of \"mutual withdrawal\", FG/PCF candidates who won fewer votes than another left-wing candidates withdrew from the runoff. As a result, the FG was left with only 10 seats - 7 of those for the PCF. It was the PCF's worst seat count in its entire history.\n\nDespite this defeat, the PCF leadership remains supportive of the FG strategy. Pierre Laurent was reelected unopposed at the XXXVI Congress in February 2013.<ref>[http://www.lepoint.fr/politique/pcf-pierre-laurent-reelu-secretaire-national-avec-100-des-voix-10-02-2013-1625935_20.php PCF : Pierre Laurent r\u00e9\u00e9lu secr\u00e9taire national avec 100 % des voix], ''[[Le Point]]'', 10 February 2013</ref> On the same occasion, the [[hammer and sickle]] were removed from party membership cards.

Plug Into Adventure!'', is a [[Platform game|platform]]-[[Adventure game|adventure]] [[video game]] for the [[GameCube]] developed by [[Skip Ltd.]] with collaboration from [[Nintendo]]. The game was first released in Japan in 2005, and then released in North America and Europe the following year. Originally conceived as a [[point and click]] adventure game, it was put on developmental hold until Nintendo producer [[Shigeru Miyamoto]] gained interest in the title and overhauled its production.\n\nThe player takes on the role of the eponymous character, Chibi-Robo, a 10-centimeter-tall [[robot]] that has a [[power plug]] for a tail. Gameplay revolves around navigating a household and collecting \"Happy Points\". These points are accumulated by completing various tasks from [[homemaking|housework]] to helping solve the dilemmas of the Sanderson family and the numerous living toys that inhabit their household. Every action by the game's [[Battery (electricity)|battery]]-powered protagonist consumes energy, requiring the player to recharge using the home's electrical outlets.\n\n''Chibi-Robo!'' was generally well received, with praise for its premise, charming storyline, and sound design. However, some gameplay mechanics and the quality of the graphics drew criticism. Sales of ''Chibi-Robo!'' were modest, but it did spawn three sequels. For the [[Nintendo DS]], ''[[Chibi-Robo!: Park Patrol]]'' was released in 2007 and ''[[#Okaeri! Chibi-Robo! Happy Richie \u014cs\u014dji!|Okaeri! Chibi-Robo! Happy Richie \u014cs\u014dji!]]'' was released in 2009, the latter being a Japan-exclusive. An entry for the [[Nintendo 3DS]] launched in Japan in 2013 and 2014 in North America, entitled ''[[#Chibi-Robo! Photo Finder|Chibi-Robo! Photo Finder]]''. The original ''Chibi-Robo!'' also saw a Japanese re-release in 2009 for the [[Wii]] as part of the [[New Play Control!]] series.\n\n=== ''Chibi-Robo!: Park Patrol'' ===\n{{Main|Chibi-Robo!: Park Patrol}}\n\n''Chibi-Robo!

(video game)|Chibi-Robo!]]'' for the [[GameCube]].\n\nUnlike the previous game, ''Chibi-Robo! Park Patrol'' takes place almost entirely outdoors, and puts the player in the role of the titular character Chibi-Robo, a four-inch-tall [[robot]] tasked with revitalizing a [[park]]. The player does so by growing seeds into [[flower]]s by watering them with a [[syringe|squirter]], and then spreading more seeds by causing the flowers to dance using a tiny [[boombox]]. The player can also alter the terrain, build and repair various structures, visit the accompanying town, and defend the park from noxious [[Smog]]lings, bits of pollution which can kill flowers.\n\n=== ''Okaeri!

Happy Richie \u014cs\u014dji!'' is similar to the original ''[[Chibi-Robo! (video game)|Chibi-Robo!]]''. The player takes control of the titular character, a 10-centimeter-tall [[robot]] whose job is to clean the inside of a house to make his family happy.<ref name=\"spencer\"/> Chibi-Robo is owned by Jenny from the previous game, who is now all grown up and living in a house with her son Keith and dog Lucky. The game introduces a tiny [[vacuum cleaner]] that Chibi-Robo can use to suck up dirt while connected to a power outlet and a tiny [[sieve|sifter]] used to find [[Gemstone|gems]] which can be turned in for money. The player can use the money to buy [[furniture]] for the house over a [[home shopping]] network using the telephone.<ref name=\"spencer\"/> The main difference from the original games in the series, is that instead of just having power outlets which let the player charge Chibi-Robo's battery, they need to put rubbish into a trash compactor to get electricity for the outlets.\n\nThe game received a high 34 out of 40 from ''[[Famitsu|Weekly Famitsu]]'' magazine in Japan.<ref>{{cite web | author=RawmeatCowboy | date=July 14, 2009 | title=Famitsu - review scores (updated with Punch-Out!! hatred) | url=http://gonintendo.com/viewstory.php?id=89336 | publisher=GoNintendo | accessdate=2009-07-24 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090719020948/http://gonintendo.com/viewstory.php?id=89336 | archive-date=July 19, 2009 | url-status=dead }}</ref> It was the fifth best-selling game in Japan during the week of its release, selling 35,000 units.<ref>{{cite web | author=Graft, Kris | date=July 30, 2009 | title=Japanese Charts: Dragon Quest IX Continues Reign | url=http://gamasutra.com/php-bin/news_index.php?story=24645 | publisher=[[Gamasutra]] | accessdate=2009-07-30}}</ref> It fell to number nine the following week, selling 23,000 copies.<ref>{{cite web | author=Graft, Kris | date=August 6, 2009| title=Japanese Charts: Monster Hunter 3 Dethrones Dragon Quest IX, Gears 2 Debuts | url=http://gamasutra.com/php-bin/news_index.php?story=24748 | publisher=Gamasutra | accessdate=2009-08-13}}</ref> Regional sales of the game totalled 130,092 units in 2009.<ref>{{cite web | title=GEIMIN.NET\uff0f2009\u5e74\u30c6\u30ec\u30d3\u30b2\u30fc\u30e0\u30bd\u30d5\u30c8\u58f2\u308a\u4e0a\u3052\u30e9\u30f3\u30ad\u30f3\u30b0\uff08\u30d5\u30a1\u30df\u901a\u7248\uff09| url=http://geimin.net/da/db/2009_ne_fa/index.php | publisher=Geimin.net | language=Japanese | accessdate=2010-07-23}}</ref>\n\n{{Clear}}\n\n=== ''Chibi-Robo!

Let's Go, Photo!''' in Europe and Australia, is a [[video game]] for the [[Nintendo 3DS]] handheld game console via the [[Nintendo eShop]]. It is the fourth installment in ''Chibi-Robo!'' game series developed by [[Skip Ltd.]] and published by [[Nintendo]].\n\nUnlike past entries in the series, ''Photo Finder'' doesn't focus on cleaning or performing helpful tasks, but rather, a brand-new new mechanic that involves the 3DS's augmented reality capabilities. The game revolves around collecting everyday objects, known as NostalJunk, and placing them on display in a museum. The game still has cleaning functions, as with Chibi-Robo: Plug Into Adventure! and Chibi-Robo: Park Patrol, but Photo Finder turns said cleaning sections into missions Chibi-Robo can access at any time using the Chibi-PC. These missions are jobs that several of the supporting characters send via e-mail, and range from cleaning out a garage, to blasting wasabi into various sushi on a conveyor belt. Based on your performance, you are rewarded varying amounts of Happy Points, which function once again as the game's currency. Happy Points can then in turn be traded in for silhouette films that show outlines of household objects, which can be purchased from the shop, which can also be accessed from the Chibi-PC.\n\nOnce a film is purchased, the player is then able to shoot a photo with the 3DS's built in camera. The screen will show the silhouette of the household object, and the player's goal is to find an object that matches the outline. After lining the object up with the outline, the player has ten tries to take a picture that most matches the outline. The object's quality is measured by a percentage in the top right corner. If an object is below 60%, it won't transfer. If it's between 60% to 99%, it has a chance of either being transferred, or becoming a NostalDud. However, if the object has 100% accuracy, it will not only transfer no matter what, but all following objects created with the film will be cutouts, which means that an object won't have to match the outline of the film.\n\nThe game also involves exploration stages that can be accessed after unlocking new jobs. These areas allow the player to dabble in more traditional Chibi-Robo gameplay. However, rather than unlocking or buying new items in order to better clean and traverse the area, necessary tools are received upon entering the area. Trash and dust piles litter the vicinity, and Chibi-Robo has the option to either clean it up, or just explore the area. However, in order to leave the area, Chibi-Robo must dispose of the collected refuse in a Recycling Machine located near the exit. The compactor will then reward you for your efforts; the more trash you pick up, the more Happy Points are rewarded.\n\nLike before, Chibi-Robo relies heavily on battery power. Due to his limited battery size, he must constantly watch his Watts meter and conserve his energy by all means possible. Once Chibi-Robo loses all of his Watts, he will power down and collapse on the spot. If this happens during a job, Chibi-Robo will be returned to Mr. Curator's desk and receive no Happy Points. There are two ways to recharge: by plugging into the outlet on Mr. Curator's desk, or by finding a battery hidden in one of the many explorable areas.\n\n{{Clear}}\n\n=== ''Chibi-Robo!

Plug Into Adventure!'', is a [[Platform game|platform]]-[[Adventure game|adventure]] [[video game]] for the [[GameCube]] developed by [[Skip Ltd.]] with collaboration from [[Nintendo]]. The game was first released in Japan in 2005, and then released in North America and Europe the following year. Originally conceived as a [[point and click]] adventure game, it was put on developmental hold until Nintendo producer [[Shigeru Miyamoto]] gained interest in the title and overhauled its production.\n\nThe player takes on the role of the eponymous character, Chibi-Robo, a 10-centimeter-tall [[robot]] that has a [[power plug]] for a tail. Gameplay revolves around navigating a household and collecting \"Happy Points\". These points are accumulated by completing various tasks from [[homemaking|housework]] to helping solve the dilemmas of the Sanderson family and the numerous living toys that inhabit their household. Every action by the game's [[Battery (electricity)|battery]]-powered protagonist consumes energy, requiring the player to recharge using the home's electrical outlets.\n\n''Chibi-Robo!'' was generally well received, with praise for its premise, charming storyline, and sound design. However, some gameplay mechanics and the quality of the graphics drew criticism. Sales of ''Chibi-Robo!'' were modest, but it did spawn three sequels. For the [[Nintendo DS]], ''[[Chibi-Robo!: Park Patrol]]'' was released in 2007 and ''[[#Okaeri! Chibi-Robo! Happy Richie \u014cs\u014dji!|Okaeri! Chibi-Robo! Happy Richie \u014cs\u014dji!]]'' was released in 2009, the latter being a Japan-exclusive. An entry for the [[Nintendo 3DS]] launched in Japan in 2013 and 2014 in North America, entitled ''[[#Chibi-Robo! Photo Finder|Chibi-Robo! Photo Finder]]''. The original ''Chibi-Robo!'' also saw a Japanese re-release in 2009 for the [[Wii]] as part of the [[New Play Control!]] series.\n\n=== ''Chibi-Robo!: Park Patrol'' ===\n{{Main|Chibi-Robo!: Park Patrol}}\n\n''Chibi-Robo!

(video game)|Chibi-Robo!]]'' for the [[GameCube]].\n\nUnlike the previous game, ''Chibi-Robo! Park Patrol'' takes place almost entirely outdoors, and puts the player in the role of the titular character Chibi-Robo, a four-inch-tall [[robot]] tasked with revitalizing a [[park]]. The player does so by growing seeds into [[flower]]s by watering them with a [[syringe|squirter]], and then spreading more seeds by causing the flowers to dance using a tiny [[boombox]]. The player can also alter the terrain, build and repair various structures, visit the accompanying town, and defend the park from noxious [[Smog]]lings, bits of pollution which can kill flowers.\n\n=== ''Okaeri!

The player takes control of the titular character, a 10-centimeter-tall [[robot]] whose job is to clean the inside of a house to make his family happy.<ref name=\"spencer\"/> Chibi-Robo is owned by Jenny from the previous game, who is now all grown up and living in a house with her son Keith and dog Lucky. The game introduces a tiny [[vacuum cleaner]] that Chibi-Robo can use to suck up dirt while connected to a power outlet and a tiny [[sieve|sifter]] used to find [[Gemstone|gems]] which can be turned in for money. The player can use the money to buy [[furniture]] for the house over a [[home shopping]] network using the telephone.<ref name=\"spencer\"/> The main difference from the original games in the series, is that instead of just having power outlets which let the player charge Chibi-Robo's battery, they need to put rubbish into a trash compactor to get electricity for the outlets.\n\nThe game received a high 34 out of 40 from ''[[Famitsu|Weekly Famitsu]]'' magazine in Japan.<ref>{{cite web | author=RawmeatCowboy | date=July 14, 2009 | title=Famitsu - review scores (updated with Punch-Out!! hatred) | url=http://gonintendo.com/viewstory.php?id=89336 | publisher=GoNintendo | accessdate=2009-07-24 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090719020948/http://gonintendo.com/viewstory.php?id=89336 | archive-date=July 19, 2009 | url-status=dead }}</ref> It was the fifth best-selling game in Japan during the week of its release, selling 35,000 units.<ref>{{cite web | author=Graft, Kris | date=July 30, 2009 | title=Japanese Charts: Dragon Quest IX Continues Reign | url=http://gamasutra.com/php-bin/news_index.php?story=24645 | publisher=[[Gamasutra]] | accessdate=2009-07-30}}</ref> It fell to number nine the following week, selling 23,000 copies.<ref>{{cite web | author=Graft, Kris | date=August 6, 2009| title=Japanese Charts: Monster Hunter 3 Dethrones Dragon Quest IX, Gears 2 Debuts | url=http://gamasutra.com/php-bin/news_index.php?story=24748 | publisher=Gamasutra | accessdate=2009-08-13}}</ref> Regional sales of the game totalled 130,092 units in 2009.<ref>{{cite web | title=GEIMIN.NET\uff0f2009\u5e74\u30c6\u30ec\u30d3\u30b2\u30fc\u30e0\u30bd\u30d5\u30c8\u58f2\u308a\u4e0a\u3052\u30e9\u30f3\u30ad\u30f3\u30b0\uff08\u30d5\u30a1\u30df\u901a\u7248\uff09| url=http://geimin.net/da/db/2009_ne_fa/index.php | publisher=Geimin.net | language=Japanese | accessdate=2010-07-23}}</ref>\n\n{{Clear}}\n\n=== ''Chibi-Robo!

Let's Go, Photo!''' in Europe and Australia, is a [[video game]] for the [[Nintendo 3DS]] handheld game console via the [[Nintendo eShop]]. It is the fourth installment in ''Chibi-Robo!'' game series developed by [[Skip Ltd.]] and published by [[Nintendo]].\n\nUnlike past entries in the series, ''Photo Finder'' doesn't focus on cleaning or performing helpful tasks, but rather, a brand-new new mechanic that involves the 3DS's augmented reality capabilities. The game revolves around collecting everyday objects, known as NostalJunk, and placing them on display in a museum. The game still has cleaning functions, as with Chibi-Robo: Plug Into Adventure! and Chibi-Robo: Park Patrol, but Photo Finder turns said cleaning sections into missions Chibi-Robo can access at any time using the Chibi-PC. These missions are jobs that several of the supporting characters send via e-mail, and range from cleaning out a garage, to blasting wasabi into various sushi on a conveyor belt. Based on your performance, you are rewarded varying amounts of Happy Points, which function once again as the game's currency. Happy Points can then in turn be traded in for silhouette films that show outlines of household objects, which can be purchased from the shop, which can also be accessed from the Chibi-PC.\n\nOnce a film is purchased, the player is then able to shoot a photo with the 3DS's built in camera. The screen will show the silhouette of the household object, and the player's goal is to find an object that matches the outline. After lining the object up with the outline, the player has ten tries to take a picture that most matches the outline. The object's quality is measured by a percentage in the top right corner. If an object is below 60%, it won't transfer. If it's between 60% to 99%, it has a chance of either being transferred, or becoming a NostalDud. However, if the object has 100% accuracy, it will not only transfer no matter what, but all following objects created with the film will be cutouts, which means that an object won't have to match the outline of the film.\n\nThe game also involves exploration stages that can be accessed after unlocking new jobs. These areas allow the player to dabble in more traditional Chibi-Robo gameplay.
