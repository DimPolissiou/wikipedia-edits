These techniques are meant to provide [[basic human needs|basic necessities]] for human life which include [[water]], [[food]], and [[wikt:shelter|shelter]]. The skills also support proper knowledge and interactions with animals and plants to promote the sustaining of life over a period of time.

[[Bushcraft]] and [[Primitive skills|primitive living]] are most often self-implemented, but require many of the same skills.\n\n== First aid ==\n{{Main|Wilderness medical emergency}}\n[[File:First aid 19.jpg|alt=A first aid kit|thumb|A first aid kit containing equipment to treat common injuries and illness]]\n[[First aid]] ([[wilderness first aid]] in particular) can help a person survive and function with injuries and illnesses that would otherwise kill or incapacitate him/her. Common and dangerous injuries include:\n* [[Bite]]s from snakes, spiders and other wild animals\n* [[Bone fractures]]\n* [[Burn]]s\n* [[Drowsiness]]\n* [[Headache]]\n* [[Heart attack]]\n* [[Hemorrhage]]\n* [[Hypothermia]] and [[hyperthermia]] \n* [[Infection]] through food, animal contact, or drinking non-potable water\n* [[Poison]]ing from consumption of, or contact with, [[poisonous plants]] or poisonous [[fungi]]\n* [[Sprains]], particularly of the [[ankle]]\n* [[Vomiting]]\n* [[Wound]]s, which may become [[infection|infected]]\n\nThe survivor may need to apply the contents of a [[first aid kit]] or, if possessing the required knowledge, naturally occurring medicinal plants, immobilize injured limbs, or even transport incapacitated comrades.  You can also use sap from a tree, and if you can't find any sap, one quick hit with an axe should reveal a small amount.  Of course this is for small cuts and the sap will act as a plaster to help your cut recover.\n\n== Shelter ==\n{{Main|Bivouac shelter}}\n[[File:Shelter from tarp and sticks.jpg|thumb|Shelter built from tarp and sticks. Pictured are displaced persons from the [[Sri Lankan Civil War]]]]\n\nMany people who are forced into survival situations often have risk of danger because of direct exposure to the elements. Most people in survival situations die of [[hypothermia|hypo]]/[[hyperthermia]], or animal attacks. A shelter can range from a natural shelter, such as a [[cave]], overhanging rock [[outcrop]], or fallen-down tree, to an intermediate form of man-made shelter such as a debris hut, tree pit shelter, or [[snow cave]], to completely man-made structures such as a [[Tarpaulin|tarp]], [[tent]], or [[Longhouses of the indigenous peoples of North America|longhouse]]. It is noted that some common properties between these structures are:\n\n- Location (away from hazards, such as cliffs, and nearby materials, like food sources)\n\n- Insulation (from ground, rain, wind, air, or sun)\n\n- Heat Source (either body heat or fire-heated)\n\n- Personal or Group Shelter (having multiple individuals)\n\n== Fire ==\n[[Fire]] (in layman's terms) is a combustion reaction between oxygen and fuel, that produces heat and smoke. The resulting heat from the reaction can prolong or prevent the risk of hypothermia. Lighting a fire without a lighter or matches, e.g. by using natural flint and a rock or metal with [[tinder]], is a frequent subject of both books on survival and in survival courses, often due to the lack of said materials if an individual was stranded. There is an emphasis placed on practicing fire-making skills before venturing into the wilderness. Producing fire under adverse conditions has been made much easier by the introduction of tools such as the [[Solar Spark Lighter|solar spark lighter]] and the [[fire piston]].\n\nFires are either started with a concentration of heat, as in the case of the solar spark lighter, or through a spark, as in the case of flint striking a rock or metal. It is to be noted that fires will often times be put out if either there is excessive wind (such as either over fanning a fire, or strong winds), or if the fuel or environment is too wet to ignite.\n\nAn example of a fire starting technique involves using a black powder firearm if one is available. Proper gun safety is to be known with this technique to avoid potential injury or death. The technique involves ramming cotton cloth or wadding down the barrel of the firearm until the cloth is against the powder charge. Next, the gun is fired upwards to avoid hitting oneself, then one proceeds to run and pick up the cloth that is projected out of the barrel, and then blows it into flame. It works better if there is a supply of tinder at hand so that the cloth can be placed against it to start the fire.<ref>Churchill, James E. The Basic Essentials of Survival. Merrillville, IN: ICS, 1989. Print.</ref>\n\nFire is presented as a tool meeting many survival needs. Along with the need that's mentioned above, it also disinfects water (through boiling and condensing), and can be used to cook and prevent illnesses in foods like animal meat. Another advantage that is presented through fire is a under looked psychological boost through the sense of safety and protection it gives. In the wild, fire can provide a sensation of home, a focal point, in addition to being an essential energy source. Fire may deter wild animals from interfering with an individual, however wild animals may be attracted to the light and heat of a fire.\n\n== Water ==\n[[File:Hydration pack.jpg|thumb|[[Hydration pack]] manufactured by [[Camelbak]]]]\n\nA human being can survive an average of three to five days without the intake of water. The issues presented by the need for water dictate that unnecessary water loss by [[perspiration]] be avoided in survival situations. The need for water increases with exercise.<ref name=\"hub\">[http://health.howstuffworks.com/live-without-food-and-water2.htm HowStuffWorks] by Charles W. Bryant</ref> Since the human body is composed of up to 78% water, it should be no surprise that water is higher on the list than fire or food. Ideally, a person should drink about a gallon of water per day. Many lost persons perish due to dehydration, and/or the debilitating effects of water-born pathogens from untreated water.\n\nA typical person will lose minimally two to maximally four liters of water per day under ordinary conditions, and more in hot, dry, or cold weather. Four to six liters of water or other liquids are generally required each day in the wilderness to avoid dehydration and to keep the body functioning properly.<ref name=\"balance\">[http://boreal.net/articles/survival-training/water-balance.php Water Balance; a Key to Cold Weather Survival] by Bruce Zawalsky, Chief Instructor, BWI</ref> The U.S. Army survival manual does not recommend drinking water only when thirsty, as this leads to underhydrating. Instead, water should be drunk at regular intervals.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.aircav.com/survival/asch13/asch13p02.html |title=Army Survival Manual; Chapter 13 \u2013 Page 2 |publisher=Aircav.com |access-date=2011-10-21}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.survivalebooks.com/survivalfm3-0570.html |title=U.S. Army Survival Manual FM 21-76, also known as FM 3-05.70 May 2002 Issue; drinking water |publisher=Survivalebooks.com |access-date=2011-10-21}}</ref> Other groups recommend rationing water through \"water discipline\".<ref>\"Water Discipline\" at Survival Topics</ref>\n\nA lack of water causes [[dehydration]], which may result in [[lethargy]], [[headaches]], [[dizziness]], [[confusion]], and eventually death. Even mild dehydration reduces [[endurance]] and impairs [[concentration]], which is dangerous in a survival situation where clear thinking is essential. Dark yellow or brown urine is a diagnostic indicator of dehydration. To avoid dehydration, a high priority is typically assigned to locating a supply of drinking water and making provision to render that water as safe as possible.\n\nRecent thinking is that boiling or commercial filters are significantly safer than use of chemicals, with the exception of [[chlorine dioxide]].<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://safewater.supportportal.com/ics/support/default.asp?deptID=23015 |title=US EPA |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111229212621/http://safewater.supportportal.com/ics/support/default.asp?deptID=23015 |archive-date=29 December 2011 |access-date=2011-12-27}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.wemjournal.org/wmsonline/?request=get-abstract&issn=1080-6032&volume=008&issue=02&page=0096 |title=Wilderness Medical Society |publisher=Wemjournal.org |access-date=2011-10-21}}{{Dead link|date=September 2016}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |url=http://dnr.wi.gov/org/water/dwg/Crypto.htm |title=Wisconsin Dept. of Natural Resources |date=2008-03-11 |publisher=Dnr.wi.gov |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120308121327/http://dnr.wi.gov/org/water/dwg/Crypto.htm |archive-date=8 March 2012 |access-date=2011-10-21}}</ref>\n\n== Food ==\n[[root vegetable|Culinary root tubers]], [[List of culinary fruits|fruit]], [[edible mushrooms]], [[List of nuts|edible nuts, edible beans, edible cereals]] or [[List of plants with edible leaves|edible leaves]], [[edible moss]], [[edible cacti]] and [[Culinary algae|algae]] can be gathered and, if needed, prepared (mostly by boiling). With the exception of leaves, these foods are relatively high in [[calorie]]s, providing some energy to the body. Plants are some of the easiest food sources to find in the jungle, forest or desert because they are stationary and can thus be had without exerting much effort.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.survivalgrounds.com/index.php |title=Master The Great Outdoors |publisher=SurvivalGrounds.com |access-date=2011-10-21}}</ref>\nSkills and equipment (such as bows, snares and nets) are necessary to gather animal food in the wild include [[animal trapping]], [[hunting]], and [[fishing]].\n\nFocusing on survival until rescued by presumed searchers, the [[Boy Scouts of America]], or BSA, especially discourages foraging for wild foods on the grounds that the knowledge and skills needed are unlikely to be possessed by those finding themselves in a wilderness survival situation, making the risks (including use of energy) outweigh the benefits.<ref>Wilderness Survival Merit Badge pamphlet, January 2008, at 38</ref>\n\n== Navigation ==\n[[File:Pole01-eng.jpg|thumb|Celestial navigation: using the Southern Cross to navigate South without a compass]]\nThose going for trips and hikes are advised<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.police.vic.gov.au/content.asp?Document_ID=174 |title=Victoria Police - Search and Rescue Squad |last=Police |first=Victoria |website=www.police.vic.gov.au}}</ref> by Search and Rescue Services to notify a trusted contact of their planned return time, then notify them of your return. They can tell them to contact the police for search and rescue if you have not returned by a specific time frame (e.g. 12 hours of your scheduled return time).\n\nSurvival situations can often be resolved by finding a way to safety, or a more suitable location to wait for rescue. Types of navigation include:\n* [[Celestial navigation]], using the [[sun]] and the night sky to locate the cardinal directions and to maintain course of travel\n* Using a [[map]], [[compass]] or [[GPS]] receiver\n* [[Dead reckoning]]\n* Natural navigation, using the condition of surrounding natural objects (i.e. moss on a tree, snow on a hill, direction of running water, etc.)\n\n== Mind preparedness ==\nThe mind and its processes are critical to survival. The will to live in a life-and-death situation often separates those that live and those that do not. Stories of heroic feats of survival by regular people with little or no training but a strong will to live are not uncommon.

The skills also support proper knowledge and interactions with animals and plants to promote the sustaining of life over a period of time.

[[Bushcraft]] and [[Primitive skills|primitive living]] are most often self-implemented, but require many of the same skills.\n\n== First aid ==\n{{Main|Wilderness medical emergency}}\n[[File:First aid 19.jpg|alt=A first aid kit|thumb|A first aid kit containing equipment to treat common injuries and illness]]\n[[First aid]] ([[wilderness first aid]] in particular) can help a person survive and function with injuries and illnesses that would otherwise kill or incapacitate him/her. Common and dangerous injuries include:\n* [[Bite]]s from snakes, spiders and other wild animals\n* [[Bone fractures]]\n* [[Burn]]s\n* [[Drowsiness]]\n* [[Headache]]\n* [[Heart attack]]\n* [[Hemorrhage]]\n* [[Hypothermia]] and [[hyperthermia]] \n* [[Infection]] through food, animal contact, or drinking non-potable water\n* [[Poison]]ing from consumption of, or contact with, [[poisonous plants]] or poisonous [[fungi]]\n* [[Sprains]], particularly of the [[ankle]]\n* [[Vomiting]]\n* [[Wound]]s, which may become [[infection|infected]]\n\nThe survivor may need to apply the contents of a [[first aid kit]] or, if possessing the required knowledge, naturally occurring medicinal plants, immobilize injured limbs, or even transport incapacitated comrades.\n\n== Shelter ==\n{{Main|Bivouac shelter}}\n[[File:Shelter from tarp and sticks.jpg|thumb|Shelter built from tarp and sticks. Pictured are displaced persons from the [[Sri Lankan Civil War]]]]\n\nMany people who are forced into survival situations often have risk of danger because of direct exposure to the elements. Most people in survival situations die of [[hypothermia|hypo]]/[[hyperthermia]], or animal attacks. A shelter can range from a natural shelter, such as a [[cave]], overhanging rock [[outcrop]], or fallen-down tree, to an intermediate form of man-made shelter such as a debris hut, tree pit shelter, or [[snow cave]], to completely man-made structures such as a [[Tarpaulin|tarp]], [[tent]], or [[Longhouses of the indigenous peoples of North America|longhouse]]. It is noted that some common properties between these structures are:\n\n- Location (away from hazards, such as cliffs, and nearby materials, like food sources)\n\n- Insulation (from ground, rain, wind, air, or sun)\n\n- Heat Source (either body heat or fire-heated)\n\n- Personal or Group Shelter (having multiple individuals)\n\n== Fire ==\n[[Fire]] (in layman's terms) is a combustion reaction between oxygen and fuel, that produces heat and smoke. The resulting heat from the reaction can prolong or prevent the risk of hypothermia. Lighting a fire without a lighter or matches, e.g. by using natural flint and a rock or metal with [[tinder]], is a frequent subject of both books on survival and in survival courses, often due to the lack of said materials if an individual was stranded. There is an emphasis placed on practicing fire-making skills before venturing into the wilderness. Producing fire under adverse conditions has been made much easier by the introduction of tools such as the [[Solar Spark Lighter|solar spark lighter]] and the [[fire piston]].\n\nFires are either started with a concentration of heat, as in the case of the solar spark lighter, or through a spark, as in the case of flint striking a rock or metal. It is to be noted that fires will often times be put out if either there is excessive wind (such as either over fanning a fire, or strong winds), or if the fuel or environment is too wet to ignite.\n\nAn example of a fire starting technique involves using a black powder firearm if one is available. Proper gun safety is to be known with this technique to avoid potential injury or death. The technique involves ramming cotton cloth or wadding down the barrel of the firearm until the cloth is against the powder charge. Next, the gun is fired upwards to avoid hitting oneself, then one proceeds to run and pick up the cloth that is projected out of the barrel, and then blows it into flame. It works better if there is a supply of tinder at hand so that the cloth can be placed against it to start the fire.<ref>Churchill, James E. The Basic Essentials of Survival. Merrillville, IN: ICS, 1989. Print.</ref>\n\nFire is presented as a tool meeting many survival needs. Along with the need that's mentioned above, it also disinfects water (through boiling and condensing), and can be used to cook and prevent illnesses in foods like animal meat. Another advantage that is presented through fire is a under looked psychological boost through the sense of safety and protection it gives. In the wild, fire can provide a sensation of home, a focal point, in addition to being an essential energy source. Fire may deter wild animals from interfering with an individual, however wild animals may be attracted to the light and heat of a fire.\n\n== Water ==\n[[File:Hydration pack.jpg|thumb|[[Hydration pack]] manufactured by [[Camelbak]]]]\n\nA human being can survive an average of three to five days without the intake of water. The issues presented by the need for water dictate that unnecessary water loss by [[perspiration]] be avoided in survival situations. The need for water increases with exercise.<ref name=\"hub\">[http://health.howstuffworks.com/live-without-food-and-water2.htm HowStuffWorks] by Charles W. Bryant</ref> Since the human body is composed of up to 78% water, it should be no surprise that water is higher on the list than fire or food. Ideally, a person should drink about a gallon of water per day. Many lost persons perish due to dehydration, and/or the debilitating effects of water-born pathogens from untreated water.\n\nA typical person will lose minimally two to maximally four liters of water per day under ordinary conditions, and more in hot, dry, or cold weather. Four to six liters of water or other liquids are generally required each day in the wilderness to avoid dehydration and to keep the body functioning properly.<ref name=\"balance\">[http://boreal.net/articles/survival-training/water-balance.php Water Balance; a Key to Cold Weather Survival] by Bruce Zawalsky, Chief Instructor, BWI</ref> The U.S. Army survival manual does not recommend drinking water only when thirsty, as this leads to underhydrating. Instead, water should be drunk at regular intervals.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.aircav.com/survival/asch13/asch13p02.html |title=Army Survival Manual; Chapter 13 \u2013 Page 2 |publisher=Aircav.com |access-date=2011-10-21}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.survivalebooks.com/survivalfm3-0570.html |title=U.S. Army Survival Manual FM 21-76, also known as FM 3-05.70 May 2002 Issue; drinking water |publisher=Survivalebooks.com |access-date=2011-10-21}}</ref> Other groups recommend rationing water through \"water discipline\".<ref>\"Water Discipline\" at Survival Topics</ref>\n\nA lack of water causes [[dehydration]], which may result in [[lethargy]], [[headaches]], [[dizziness]], [[confusion]], and eventually death. Even mild dehydration reduces [[endurance]] and impairs [[concentration]], which is dangerous in a survival situation where clear thinking is essential. Dark yellow or brown urine is a diagnostic indicator of dehydration. To avoid dehydration, a high priority is typically assigned to locating a supply of drinking water and making provision to render that water as safe as possible.\n\nRecent thinking is that boiling or commercial filters are significantly safer than use of chemicals, with the exception of [[chlorine dioxide]].<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://safewater.supportportal.com/ics/support/default.asp?deptID=23015 |title=US EPA |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111229212621/http://safewater.supportportal.com/ics/support/default.asp?deptID=23015 |archive-date=29 December 2011 |access-date=2011-12-27}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.wemjournal.org/wmsonline/?request=get-abstract&issn=1080-6032&volume=008&issue=02&page=0096 |title=Wilderness Medical Society |publisher=Wemjournal.org |access-date=2011-10-21}}{{Dead link|date=September 2016}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |url=http://dnr.wi.gov/org/water/dwg/Crypto.htm |title=Wisconsin Dept. of Natural Resources |date=2008-03-11 |publisher=Dnr.wi.gov |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120308121327/http://dnr.wi.gov/org/water/dwg/Crypto.htm |archive-date=8 March 2012 |access-date=2011-10-21}}</ref>\n\n== Food ==\n[[root vegetable|Culinary root tubers]], [[List of culinary fruits|fruit]], [[edible mushrooms]], [[List of nuts|edible nuts, edible beans, edible cereals]] or [[List of plants with edible leaves|edible leaves]], [[edible moss]], [[edible cacti]] and [[Culinary algae|algae]] can be gathered and, if needed, prepared (mostly by boiling).

They can tell them to contact the police for search and rescue if you have not returned by a specific time frame (e.g. 12 hours of your scheduled return time).\n\nSurvival situations can often be resolved by finding a way to safety, or a more suitable location to wait for rescue. Types of navigation include:\n* [[Celestial navigation]], using the [[sun]] and the night sky to locate the cardinal directions and to maintain course of travel\n* Using a [[map]], [[compass]] or [[GPS]] receiver\n* [[Dead reckoning]]\n* Natural navigation, using the condition of surrounding natural objects (i.e. moss on a tree, snow on a hill, direction of running water, etc.)\n\n== Mind preparedness ==\nThe mind and its processes are critical to survival. The will to live in a life-and-death situation often separates those that live and those that do not. Stories of heroic feats of survival by regular people with little or no training but a strong will to live are not uncommon. Among them is [[Juliane Koepcke]], who was the sole survivor among the 93 passengers when her [[LANSA Flight 508|plane crashed]] in the jungle of [[Peru]].

{"title_page": "Lebanon\u2013Syria border", "text_new": "[[File:Lebanon Physiography.jpg|thumb|right|Map of Lebanon]]\nThe '''Lebanon\u2013Syria border''' is 394 km (245 m) in length and runs from the Mediterranean coast in the north to the tripoint with [[Israel]] in the south.<ref>{{cite|url= https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/sy|title=CIA World Factbook \u2013 Syria|accessdate= 3 April 2020}}</ref>\n\n==Description==\nThe border starts at confluence of the [[Nahr al-Kabir]] river with the [[Mediterranean Sea]], and then follows this river eastwards some distance inland. The Lebanese border forms a [[Salient (geography)|salient]] to include the villages of Karha and Knaisse Akkar in the north-east of [[Akkar District]], just west of the Syrian [[Lake Homs]], before turning to the south-east via a series of irregular lines, cutting across the [[Orontes River|Orontes]] (at {{coord|34.455|N|36.490|E|}}) and the [[Beqaa Valley|trans-Beqaa]] road between [[Qaa]] and [[Al-Qusayr, Syria|Al-Qusayr]] (at {{coord|34.4217|N|36.5433|E|}}), reaching the [[Anti-Lebanon mountains]] at about {{coord|34.22|N|36.60|E|}}. The border then turns towards the south-west, generally following the Anti-Lebanon mountains via a series of irregular lines, until reaching [[Mount Hermon]]. \n\nThe precise location of Lebanese-Israeli-Syrian [[tripoint]] is unclear due to Israel's [[occupation of the Golan Heights]]. The ''de jure'' tripoint lies on the [[Hasbani River]], a tributary of the  [[river Jordan]], at {{coord|33.2422|N|35.6244|E|}}), just north-east of the Israeli town of [[Ma'ayan Baruch]].

The Lebanese border forms a [[Salient (geography)|salient]] to include the villages of Karha and Knaisse Akkar in the north-east of [[Akkar District]], just west of the Syrian [[Lake Homs]], before turning to the south-east via a series of irregular lines, cutting across the [[Orontes River|Orontes]] (at {{coord|34.455|N|36.490|E|}}) and the [[Beqaa Valley|trans-Beqaa]] road between [[Qaa]] and [[Al-Qusayr, Syria|Al-Qusayr]] (at {{coord|34.4217|N|36.5433|E|}}), reaching the [[Anti-Lebanon mountains]] at about {{coord|34.22|N|36.60|E|}}. The border then turns towards the south-west, generally following the Anti-Lebanon mountains via a series of irregular lines, until reaching [[Mount Hermon]]. \n\nThe precise location of Lebanese-Israeli-Syrian [[tripoint]] is unclear due to Israel's [[occupation of the Golan Heights]]. The ''de jure'' tripoint lies on the [[Hasbani River]], a tributary of the  [[river Jordan]], at {{coord|33.2422|N|35.6244|E|}}), just north-east of the Israeli town of [[Ma'ayan Baruch]].
