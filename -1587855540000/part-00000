Post''<ref name=\":11\" /> returned to the headlines periodically over a four-year period between 1907 and 1911. Augustus Post petitioned the court to have his alimony reduced, indicating that he was ill and had lost his fortune in the stock market panic of 1907. His primary employer, E. D. Shepherd Banking, went into bankruptcy that year, but Post continued his work in Alexander Graham Bell's Aerial Experiment Association and then worked with Glenn Curtiss building and testing aircraft. By 1912 Emma and Augustus Post had formally separated and Emma Post had moved to Virginia.<ref>{{cite news|title=Mrs. Post Welcomes Soldiers|url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/5089169/emma_post_and_rifle_range_in_norfolk/|newspaper=The Washington Post =May 5, 1912|page=12|via=[[Newspapers.com]]|accessdate=June 17, 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181108025919/https://www.newspapers.com/clip/5089169/emma_post_and_rifle_range_in_norfolk/#|archive-date=2018-11-08|url-status=live}} {{free access}}</ref>\n\nIn 1935, Post moved in with the well-known sculptor and photographer [[Frederic Allen Williams]].

Damaged DNA during G1, before entry into S phase, and during S phase result in the expression of [[ATM serine/threonine kinase|ATM/R]] protein. ATM/R protein then stabilizes and activates transcription factor [[p53]] so that it can bind to upstream regions of genes, inducing the expression of proteins including p21CIP. p21CIP binds to and inhibits any cyclin-cdk present in the cell cycle, halting the cycle until DNA damage can be corrected.<ref name=Wang>{{cite journal | vauthors = Wang X, Simpson ER, Brown KA | title = p53: Protection against Tumor Growth beyond Effects on Cell Cycle and Apoptosis | journal = Cancer Research | volume = 75 | issue = 23 | pages = 5001\u20137 | date = December 2015 | pmid = 26573797 | doi = 10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-15-0563 }}</ref>\n\n===Additional processes at DNA damage checkpoints===\nOf the four DNA damage checkpoints, two have an additional process for monitoring DNA damage other than activating p53.

Zaretsky contends that despite the ridiculous figure Boswell was sometimes regarded as, his irrepressible curiosity and desire to ingratiate himself with the leading figures of the day made him a representative figure of the Enlightenment. Zaretsky writes:<blockquote>Though he sought out and surrounded himself with men and women who were larger than life, Boswell was like us, but only more so. In his great swings of exuberance and enervation, his moments of great insight and great weakness, Boswell not only embodied the enduring doubts and hopes that mark the modern age, but also expressed them with an intellectual honesty and spare artistry no less enduring.{{sfn|Zaretsky|2015|p=242}}</blockquote><!-- Robert Zaretsky and John T.

But for Boswell it was always a movement, or movements, to supplant the certainty of systems with the vagaries of selfhood....

Zaretsky brilliantly, sometimes movingly, adds to that fascination. It\u2019s frustrating, however, that he leaves his protagonist in mid-life, before Boswell takes up his classic Life of Samuel Johnson. Also, though Zaretsky opens the book with a short, lively critique of Enlightenment scholarship, he doesn\u2019t indicate how, if at all, his portrait of Boswell alters our present knowledge of the era. So convincing are Zaretsky\u2019s observations, so sure his touch, that one wishes for more\u2014a longer, fuller study of his subject.{{sfn|Publishers Weekly|2015}}</blockquote>\n\nFritz Lanham in the ''Houston Chronicle'' concluded that \"Boswell remains an attractive figure because he wrestled so passionately with doubts and grand questions of life that continue to occupy us, young\nand old.

Though only 288 pages long, ''Boswell\u2019s Enlightenment'' has the feeling of being padded out. Zaretsky\u2019s academic background obliges him to insert references to colleagues in the field, as if to give scholarly backing to assertions verging on the \nobvious....

Casting him as any kind of avatar of the Enlightenment is, to put it mildly, a bit of a stretch.\"{{sfn|Donoghue|2015}}\n\n''Kirkus Reviews'' offered high praise for the book: \"This wonderful rendering of Boswell digs deep into his probing, enquiring life and the fast friends he made at every turn.\"{{sfn|Kirkus Reviews|2015}}\n\n''Publishers Weekly'' also gave a positive review, but the reviewer regretted that the book did not cover Boswell's whole life: <blockquote>Boswell\u2019s earnest search for answers to life\u2019s bewildering puzzles continues to fascinate. Zaretsky brilliantly, sometimes movingly, adds to that fascination. It\u2019s frustrating, however, that he leaves his protagonist in mid-life, before Boswell takes up his classic Life of Samuel Johnson. Also, though Zaretsky opens the book with a short, lively critique of Enlightenment scholarship, he doesn\u2019t indicate how, if at all, his portrait of Boswell alters our present knowledge of the era. So convincing are Zaretsky\u2019s observations, so sure his touch, that one wishes for more\u2014a longer, fuller study of his subject.{{sfn|Publishers Weekly|2015}}</blockquote>\n\nFritz Lanham in the ''Houston Chronicle'' concluded that \"Boswell remains an attractive figure because he wrestled so passionately with doubts and grand questions of life that continue to occupy us, young\nand old. ''Boswell\u2019s Enlightenment'' is a readable, smart, accessible introduction to a self-absorbed but likable young man who reminds us the Age of Enlightenment was also the Age of Exuberance.{{sfn|Lanham|2015}}\n\nJames Campbell, writing ''The Guardian'', gave perhaps the most negative review of major publications that considered the book: \"Boswell offers the perfect specimen for an old-and-new experiment of the kind that Zaretsky performs: a man at home in the salons of the age of Enlightenment, but one who was scarcely an enlightened thinker.... Though only 288 pages long, ''Boswell\u2019s Enlightenment'' has the feeling of being padded out. Zaretsky\u2019s academic background obliges him to insert references to colleagues in the field, as if to give scholarly backing to assertions verging on the \nobvious.... [R]eaders might ask themselves why they are not reading Boswell\u2019s journal instead.\"{{sfn|Campbell|2015}}\n\n==See also==\n* ''[[Boswell: Citizen of the World, Man of Letters]]''\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n==Sources==\n{{refbegin}}\n* {{cite news |last1=Campbell |first1=James |title=An Ample Faculty for Self-Deception |url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/2015/jun/06/boswells-enlightenment-robert-zaretsky-thinker |work=The Guardian |date=6 June 2015 |ref=harv}}\n* {{cite news |last1=Donoghue |first1=Steve |title=<em>Boswell's Enlightenment</em> posits the bold and bawdy James Boswell as an avatar of his era |accessdate=12 September 2019 |work=Christian Science Monitor |date=25 March 2015 |url=https://www.csmonitor.com/Books/Book-Reviews/2015/0325/Boswell-s-Enlightenment-posits-the-bold-and-bawdy-James-Boswell-as-an-avatar-of-his-era|ref=harv}}\n* {{Cite journal|date=15 February 2015|last=Kelly|first=Stuart|url=https://www.scotsman.com/arts-and-culture/books/book-reviews-boswell-s-enlightenment-1-3690968|title=Book reviews: <em>Boswell's Enlightenment</em>|journal=The Scotsman|language=en|access-date=2019-09-06}}\n* {{cite journal |title=Review of <em>Boswell's Enlightenment</em> by Robert Zaretsky |journal=Kirkus Reviews |date=1 January 2015 |url=https://www.kirkusreviews.com/book-reviews/robert-zaretsky/boswells-enlightenment/ |accessdate=13 September 2019 |ref={{harvid|Kirkus Reviews|2015}}}}\n* {{cite news |last1=Lanham |first1=Fritz |title=Review: <em>Boswell's Enlightenment</em> by Robert Zaretsky |url=https://blog.chron.com/bookish/2015/04/review-boswells-enlightenment-by-robert-zaretsky/ |accessdate=13 September 2019 |work=Houston Chronicle |date=11 April 2015 |ref=harv}}\n* {{cite journal |last1=O'Hagan |first1=Andrew |title=He Changed the Game and Dared to Know |journal=New York Review of Books |date=4 June 2015 |url=https://www.nybooks.com/articles/2015/06/04/he-changed-game-and-dared-know/ |accessdate=13 September 2019 |ref=harv}}\n* {{cite journal |title=Review of <em>Boswell's Enlightenment</em> |journal=Publishers Weekly |date=26 January 2015 |url=https://www.publishersweekly.com/978-0-674-36823-1 |accessdate=13 September 2019 |ref={{harvid|Publishers Weekly|2015}}}}\n* {{cite book |last1=Zaretsky |first1=Robert |title=Boswell's Enlightenment |date=2015 |publisher=The Belknap Press of Harvard University Press |location=Cambridge |isbn=978-0674368231 |ref=harv}}\n<!--* {{cite journal |last1=Zaretsky |first1=Robert |last2=Scott |first2=John T. |title=Boswell's Enlightenment |journal=Southwest Review |date=2009 |volume=94 |issue=3 |pages=349-365 |url=https://www.jstor.org/stable/43472999 |ref=harv}}-->\n{{refend}}\n\n{{Authority control}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Boswell's Enlightenment}}\n[[Category:2015 non-fiction books]]\n[[Category:English-language books]]\n[[Category:Books of literary criticism]]\n[[Category:Books about James Boswell]]\n[[Category:Belknap Press books]]\n", "name_user": "Headbomb", "label": "safe", "comment": "clean up, replaced: url=https://www.jstor.org/stable/43472999 \u2192 jstor=43472999", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boswell%27s_Enlightenment"}

The French form of the city name is ''Gothembourg'', but in French texts, the Swedish name ''G\u00f6teborg'' is more frequent. \"Gothenburg\" can also be seen in some older English texts. In Spanish and Portuguese the city is called Gotemburgo.

Political legitimacy can be based on various factors: legality, due process, and equality before the law, as well as the efficiency and effectiveness of public policy. One method used to achieve greater legitimacy for controversial policy reforms such as congestion charges is to allow citizens to decide or advise on the issue in public referendums. In December 2010 a petition for a local referendum on the congestion tax, signed by 28,000 citizens, was submitted to the City Council. This right to submit so-called \u201cpeople's initiatives\u201d was inscribed in the Local Government Act, which obliged local governments to hold a local referendum if petitioned by 5% of the citizens unless the issue was deemed to be outside their area of jurisdiction or if a majority in the City Council voted against holding such a referendum.<ref name=\"Hysing 1\u20138\">{{Cite journal|last=Hysing|first=Erik|date=1 April 2015|title=Citizen participation or representative government \u2013 Building legitimacy for the Gothenburg congestion tax|url= |journal=Transport Policy|volume=39|pages=1\u20138|doi=10.1016/j.tranpol.2015.01.002}}</ref> A second petition for a referendum, signed by 57,000 citizens, was submitted to the local government in February 2013.

Another example is the province of [[Scania]] in southern Sweden.\n\nThe city council of 1641 consisted of four Swedish, three Dutch, three German, and two Scottish members. In [[Dutch language|Dutch]], [[Scots language|Scots]], English, and German, all languages with a long history in this trade and maritime-oriented city, the name Gothenburg is or was (in the case of German) used for the city. Variations of the official German/English name Gothenburg in the city's 1621 charter existed or exist in many languages. The French form of the city name is ''Gothembourg'', but in French texts, the Swedish name ''G\u00f6teborg'' is more frequent. \"Gothenburg\" can also be seen in some older English texts. In Spanish and Portuguese the city is called Gotemburgo. These traditional forms are sometimes replaced with the use of the Swedish ''G\u00f6teborg'', for example by [[The G\u00f6teborg Opera]] and the G\u00f6teborg Ballet. However, ''G\u00f6teborgs universitet'', previously designated as the G\u00f6teborg University in English, changed its name to the [[University of Gothenburg]] in 2008.<ref>{{cite press release|url=http://www.gu.se/english/about_the_university/current/the-university-s-new-english-name.cid778745 |publisher=University of Gothenburg |title=University of Gothenburg&nbsp;\u2013 the University's new English name |date=4 February 2008 |accessdate=18 May 2011 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110728080218/http://www.gu.se/english/about_the_university/current/the-university-s-new-english-name.cid778745 |archivedate=28 July 2011  }}</ref> The Gothenburg municipality has also reverted to the use of the English name in international contexts.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://international.goteborg.se/ |title=City of Gothenburg |publisher=City of Gothenburg |date= |accessdate=15 February 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160215183929/http://international.goteborg.se/ |archive-date=15 February 2016 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\nIn 2009, the city council launched a new logotype for Gothenburg.

Political legitimacy can be based on various factors: legality, due process, and equality before the law, as well as the efficiency and effectiveness of public policy. One method used to achieve greater legitimacy for controversial policy reforms such as congestion charges is to allow citizens to decide or advise on the issue in public referendums. In December 2010 a petition for a local referendum on the congestion tax, signed by 28,000 citizens, was submitted to the City Council. This right to submit so-called \u201cpeople's initiatives\u201d was inscribed in the Local Government Act, which obliged local governments to hold a local referendum if petitioned by 5% of the citizens unless the issue was deemed to be outside their area of jurisdiction or if a majority in the City Council voted against holding such a referendum.<ref name=\"Hysing 1\u20138\">{{Cite journal|last=Hysing|first=Erik|date=1 April 2015|title=Citizen participation or representative government \u2013 Building legitimacy for the Gothenburg congestion tax|url= |journal=Transport Policy|volume=39|pages=1\u20138|doi=10.1016/j.tranpol.2015.01.002}}</ref> A second petition for a referendum, signed by 57,000 citizens, was submitted to the local government in February 2013.
