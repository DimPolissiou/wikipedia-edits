This primary arrangement was different from the normal arrangements in Southern Europe, in parts of Asia, and the Middle East where it was common for young adults to remain in or marry into the family home. In England, multi-generational households were uncommon because young adults would save enough money to move out, into their own household once they married. Sociologist Brigitte Berger argued, \"the young nuclear family had to be flexible and mobile as it searched for opportunity and property. Forced to rely on their own ingenuity, its members also needed to plan for the future and develop bourgeois habits of work and saving.\"<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://ifstudies.org/blog/the-real-roots-of-the-nuclear-family|title=The Real Roots of the Nuclear Family|work=Institute for Family Studies|access-date=2017-03-28|language=en}}</ref> Berge also mentions that this could be one of the reasons why the Industrial Revolution began in England and other Northwest European countries.

This primary arrangement was different from the normal arrangements in Southern Europe, in parts of Asia, and the Middle East where it was common for young adults to remain in or marry into the family home. In England, multi-generational households were uncommon because young adults would save enough money to move out, into their own household once they married. Sociologist Brigitte Berger argued, \"the young nuclear family had to be flexible and mobile as it searched for opportunity and property. Forced to rely on their own ingenuity, its members also needed to plan for the future and develop bourgeois habits of work and saving.\"<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://ifstudies.org/blog/the-real-roots-of-the-nuclear-family|title=The Real Roots of the Nuclear Family|work=Institute for Family Studies|access-date=2017-03-28|language=en}}</ref> Berge also mentions that this could be one of the reasons why the Industrial Revolution began in England and other Northwest European countries.

In addition, the 20 regions of Italy appoint 58 representatives as special electors. Three representatives come from each [[Regions of Italy|region]], save for the small [[Aosta Valley]] which appoints one, so as to guarantee representation for all localities and minorities.\n\nAccording to the [[Constitution of Italy|Constitution]], the election must be held in the form of secret ballot, with the 315 senators, the 630 deputies and the 58 regional representatives all voting. A two-thirds vote is required to elect on any of the first three rounds of balloting and after that a majority suffices. The election is presided over by the Speaker of the Chamber of Deputies, who calls for the public counting of the votes. The vote is held in the ''[[Palazzo Montecitorio]]'', home of the [[Italian Chamber of Deputies|Chamber of Deputies]], which is expanded and re-configured for the event.\n\nThe president assumes office after having taken an oath before Parliament and delivering a presidential address. Presidents are elected to serve a seven-year term.

Only [[Enrico De Nicola]], who was elected to be provisional head of state by the Constitutional Assembly on 28 June 1946, had an official title and took residence in the Quirinal Palace.<ref>[http://www.parlalex.it/pagina.asp?id=2823 Decreto legislativo luogotenenziale], www.paralex.it</ref> The others took the powers, but not the title of Head of State.

The [[Quirinal Palace]] (known in [[Italian language|Italian]] as the {{lang|it|Quirinale}}) in [[Rome]] is the official residence of the president of the Italian Republic. The 12 Presidents came from only six of the 20 [[regions of Italy|Regions]]: three each from [[Campania]] (all born in Naples) and [[Piedmont]], two each from [[Sardinia]] (both born in Sassari) and [[Tuscany]] and one each from [[Liguria]] and [[Sicily]].\n\n== Election ==\nThe president of the Republic is elected by Parliament in a joint session of the [[Italian Chamber of Deputies|Chamber of Deputies]] and the [[Italian Senate|Senate]]. In addition, the 20 regions of Italy appoint 58 representatives as special electors. Three representatives come from each [[Regions of Italy|region]], save for the small [[Aosta Valley]] which appoints one, so as to guarantee representation for all localities and minorities.\n\nAccording to the [[Constitution of Italy|Constitution]], the election must be held in the form of secret ballot, with the 315 senators, the 630 deputies and the 58 regional representatives all voting. A two-thirds vote is required to elect on any of the first three rounds of balloting and after that a majority suffices. The election is presided over by the Speaker of the Chamber of Deputies, who calls for the public counting of the votes. The vote is held in the ''[[Palazzo Montecitorio]]'', home of the [[Italian Chamber of Deputies|Chamber of Deputies]], which is expanded and re-configured for the event.\n\nThe president assumes office after having taken an oath before Parliament and delivering a presidential address. Presidents are elected to serve a seven-year term. [[Giorgio Napolitano]] is the only president to be elected to a second term.\n{{clear}}\n\n== Presidents of the Italian Republic (1946\u2013present) ==\n{|class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\"

Officially declared by the [[Roman Senate|Senate]] ''optimus princeps'' (\"best ruler\"), Trajan is remembered as a successful soldier-emperor who presided over the greatest military expansion in [[Roman history]], leading the empire to attain its maximum territorial extent by the time of his death. He is also known for his [[philanthropic]] rule, overseeing extensive public [[#Building activities|building programs]] and implementing [[Alimenta|social welfare policies]], which earned him his enduring reputation as the second of the [[Five Good Emperors]] who presided over an era of peace and prosperity in the [[Mediterranean world]].\n\nTrajan was born in [[Italica]], close to modern [[Seville]] in present-day [[Spain]], an [[Italic peoples|Italic settlement]] in the [[Roman province]] of [[Hispania Baetica]]. Although misleadingly designated by some later writers as a provincial, [[Gens Ulpia|his family]] came from [[Roman Umbria|Umbria]] and he was born a Roman citizen.<ref name=\"Arnold Blumberg 1995, p.&nbsp;315\">Arnold Blumberg, ''Great Leaders, Great Tyrants? Contemporary Views of World Rulers who Made History'', 1995, Greenwood Publishing Group, p.&nbsp;315: \"Trajan is frequently but misleadingly designated the first provincial emperor, because the Ulpii were from Baetica (southern Spain). The family, resident in Spain for some time, originated in Italian Tuder, not far from the Flavian home of Reate. The emperor's father, M. Ulpius Traianus, was an early adherent of Vespasian and perhaps the old family friend. This Trajan evidently married a Marcia (her name is inferred from that of their daughter Marciana) whose family owned brickyards in the vicinity of Ameria, near both Reate and Tuder. She was possibly an older sister of Marcia Furnilla, second wife of Vespasian's son Titus. Further, Ulpia, sister of the senior Trajan, was a grandmother of Hadrian. In other words, the emperor Trajan was succeeded in 117 by his cousin, member of another Italian family resident in Baetica.\"</ref> Trajan rose to prominence during the reign of emperor [[Domitian]]. Serving as a [[legatus legionis]] in [[Hispania Tarraconensis]], in 89 Trajan supported Domitian against a revolt on the [[Rhine]] led by [[Antonius Saturninus]]. In September 96, Domitian was succeeded by the old and childless [[Nerva]], who proved to be unpopular with the army. After a brief and tumultuous year in power, culminating in a revolt by members of the [[Praetorian Guard]], he was compelled to adopt the more popular Trajan as his heir and successor. Nerva died in 98 and was succeeded by his adopted son without incident.\n\nAs a civilian administrator, Trajan is best known for his extensive public building program, which reshaped the city of [[Rome]] and left numerous enduring landmarks such as [[Trajan's Forum]], [[Trajan's Market]] and [[Trajan's Column]]. Early in his reign, he annexed the [[Nabataean Kingdom]], creating the province of [[Arabia Petraea]]. His conquest of [[Roman Dacia|Dacia]] enriched the empire greatly, as the new province possessed many valuable gold mines.\n\nTrajan's war against the [[Parthian Empire]] ended with the sack of the capital [[Ctesiphon]] and the annexation of [[Roman Armenia|Armenia]] and [[Mesopotamia (Roman province)|Mesopotamia]]. His campaigns expanded the Roman Empire to its greatest territorial extent. In late 117, while sailing back to Rome, Trajan fell ill and died of a [[stroke]] in the city of [[Selinus (Cilicia)|Selinus]]. He was [[deified]] by the Senate and his ashes were laid to rest under the Column. He was succeeded by his cousin [[Hadrian]], whom Trajan supposedly adopted on his deathbed.\n\n== Sources ==\n\nhi As an emperor, Trajan's reputation has endured{{snds}}he is one of the few rulers whose reputation has survived nineteen centuries. Every new emperor after him was honoured by the Senate with the wish ''[[felicior Augusto, melior Traiano]]'' (that he be \"luckier than [[Augustus]] and better than Trajan\"). Among [[Middle Ages|medieval]] Christian theologians, Trajan was considered a [[virtuous pagan]]. In the [[Renaissance]], [[Machiavelli]], speaking on the advantages of adoptive succession over heredity, mentioned the five successive good emperors \"from Nerva to [[Marcus Aurelius|Marcus]]\"<ref>[[Discourses on Livy]], I, 10, 4</ref>{{snds}}a [[Trope (literature)|trope]] out of which the 18th-century historian [[Edward Gibbon]] popularized the notion of the [[Five Good Emperors]], of whom Trajan was the second.<ref>{{cite book|title=Idiots guide to the Roman Empire|last=Nelson|first=Eric|year=2002|publisher=Alpha Books|isbn= 978-0-02-864151-5|pages=207\u2013209}}</ref>\n\nAs far as ancient literary sources are concerned, an extant continuous account of Trajan's reign does not exist. An account of the [[Trajan's Dacian Wars|Dacian Wars]], the ''[[Dacica|Commentarii de bellis Dacicis]]'', written by Trajan himself or a [[ghostwriter]] and modelled after [[Gaius Julius Caesar|Caesar]]'s ''[[Commentarii de Bello Gallico]]'', is lost with the exception of one sentence. Only fragments remain of the ''Getica'', a book by Trajan's personal physician [[Titus Statilius Criton]]. The ''Parthica'', a 17-volume account of the [[Roman\u2013Parthian Wars|Parthian Wars]] written by [[Arrian]], has met a similar fate.{{sfn|Strobel|2010|p=14}} Book{{nbsp}}68 in [[Cassius Dio]]'s ''Roman History'', which survives mostly as [[Byzantine]] abridgments and [[epitome]]s, is the main source for the political history of Trajan's rule.{{sfn|Strobel|2010|p=15}} Besides this, [[Pliny the Younger|Pliny the Younger's]] ''Panegyricus'' and [[Dio Chrysostom|Dio of Prusa]]'s orations are the best surviving contemporary sources. Both are adulatory [[Dispositio#Peroratio|perorations]], typical of the High Imperial period, that describe an idealized monarch and an equally idealized view of Trajan's rule, and concern themselves more with ideology than with actual fact.{{sfn|Bennett|2001|pages=xii/xiii & 63}} The tenth volume of Pliny's letters contains his correspondence with Trajan, which deals with various aspects of imperial Roman government, but this correspondence is neither intimate nor candid: it is an exchange of official mail, in which Pliny's stance borders on the servile.<ref>Finley Hooper, ''Roman Realities''. [[Wayne State University Press]], 1979, {{ISBN|0-8143-1594-1}}, page 427</ref> It is certain that much of the text of the letters that appear in this collection over Trajan's signature was written and/or edited by Trajan's Imperial secretary, his ''[[ab epistulis]]''.<ref>Carlos F. Nore\u00f1a, \"The Social Economy of Pliny's Correspondence with Trajan\". ''American Journal of Philology'', 128 (2007) 239\u2013277, page 251</ref> Therefore, discussion of Trajan and his rule in modern historiography cannot avoid speculation. Non-literary sources such as archaeology, [[epigraphy]], and [[numismatics]] are also useful for reconstructing his reign.{{sfn|Bennett|2001|p=xiii}}\n\n== Early life and rise to power ==\n[[File:Imperator Caesar Nerva Traianus.jpg|thumb|275px|left|Modern statue of Nerva, [[Rome]], [[Italy]].]]\n[[File:Trajan2.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Denarius]] of Trajan, minted in Rome in 101{{ndash}}102 AD.

Although frequently designated the first provincial emperor, and dismissed by later writers such as Cassius Dio (himself of provincial origin) as \"an Iberian, and neither an Italian nor even an Italiot\", Trajan appears to have hailed on his father's side from the area of Tuder (modern [[Todi]]) in [[Roman Umbria|Umbria]], at the border with [[Etruria]], and on his mother's side from the [[Marcia (gens)|Gens Marcia]], of an Italic family of [[Sabines|Sabine]] origin. Trajan's birthplace of Italica was founded as a Roman military colony of ''Italian'' settlers in 206{{nbsp}}BC, though it is unknown when the Ulpii arrived there. It is possible, but cannot be substantiated, that Trajan's ancestors married local women and lost their citizenship at some point, but they certainly recovered their status when the city became a [[municipium]] with [[Latin citizenship]] in the mid-1st century BC.{{sfn|Bennett|2001|p=1\u20133}}<ref name=\"Arnold Blumberg 1995, p.&nbsp;315\"/>\n\nTrajan was the son of [[Marcia (mother of Trajan)|Marcia]], a Roman noblewoman and sister-in-law of the second Flavian Emperor [[Titus]],{{sfn|Strobel|2010|p=41}} and [[Marcus Ulpius Traianus (senior)|Marcus Ulpius Traianus]], a prominent senator and general from the ''[[Ulpia (gens)|gens Ulpia]]''. Marcus Ulpius Traianus the elder served [[Vespasian]] in the [[First Jewish-Roman War]], commanding the ''[[Legio X Fretensis|Legio X ''Fretensis'']]''.<ref>{{cite book|last=Goldsworthy|first=Adrian|title=In the name of Rome: The men who won the Roman Empire|date=2003|publisher=Weidenfeld & Nicolson|location=London|page=320}}</ref> Trajan himself was just one of many well-known Ulpii in a line that continued long after his own death. His elder sister was [[Ulpia Marciana]], and his niece was [[Salonina Matidia]]. The ''[[Homeland|patria]]'' of the Ulpii was Italica, in Spanish Baetica.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\" />\n\nAs a young man, he rose through the ranks of the [[Roman army]], serving in some of the most contested parts of the Empire's frontier. In 76{{ndash}}77, Trajan's father was [[Roman governor|Governor]] of [[Syria (Roman province)|Syria]] (''[[Legatus]] pro praetore Syriae''), where Trajan himself remained as ''[[Tribunus]] legionis''. From there, after his father's replacement, he seems to have been transferred to an unspecified Rhine province, and Pliny implies that he engaged in active combat duty during both commissions.{{sfn|Bennett|2001|p=22\u201323}} In about 86, Trajan's cousin [[Publius Aelius Hadrianus Afer|P.{{nbsp}}Aelius Afer]] died, leaving his young children [[Hadrian]] and [[Paulina (sister of Hadrian)|Paulina]] orphans. Trajan and a colleague of his, [[Publius Acilius Attianus]], became co-guardians of the two children.{{sfn|Garzetti|2014|p=378}}\n\nIn 91, Trajan was created ordinary [[Consul]] for the year, which was a great honour as he was in his late thirties and therefore just above the minimum legal age (32) for holding the post. This can be explained in part by the prominence of his father's career, as his father had been instrumental to the ascent of the ruling [[Flavian dynasty]], held consular rank himself and had just been made a [[patrician (ancient Rome)|patrician]].{{sfn|Bennett|2001|p=13}} Around this time Trajan brought [[Apollodorus of Damascus]] with him to [[Rome]].<ref name=\"2.5\u20136\">Augustan History, ''Life of Hadrian'' [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Historia_Augusta/Hadrian/1*.html#2.5 2.5\u20136]</ref> and also married [[Pompeia Plotina]], a noble woman from the Roman settlement at [[N\u00eemes]]; the marriage ultimately remained childless.<ref>{{cite encyclopedia|url=https://www.britannica.com/biography/Pompeia-Plotina|title=Pompei Plotina|encyclopedia=Britannica|accessdate=26 January 2017}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Perge - Trajan.jpg|thumb|left|Trajan wearing the [[civic crown]] and military garb such as a [[muscle cuirass]], 2nd century AD, [[Antalya Museum|Antalya Archaeological Museum]]]]\nIt has been remarked by authors such as [[Julian (emperor)|Julian]] and Cassius Dio that Trajan was personally inclined towards [[Homosexuality in ancient Rome|homosexuality]]. Trajan's putative lovers included [[Hadrian]], pages of the imperial household, the actor Pylades, a dancer called Apolaustus, and senator [[Lucius Licinius Sura]].{{sfn|Bennett|2001|p=58}}\n\nAs the details of Trajan's military career are obscure, it is only sure that in 89, as legate of [[Legio VII Gemina]] in [[Hispania Tarraconensis]], he supported Domitian against an attempted ''coup''.{{sfn|Bennett|2001|p=43}} Later, after his 91 consulate (held with [[Manius Acilius Glabrio (consul 91)|Acilius Glabrio]], a rare pair of consuls at the time, in that neither consul was a member of the ruling dynasty), he held some unspecified consular commission as governor on either [[Pannonia]] or [[Germania Superior]]{{snds}}possibly both. Pliny{{snds}}who seems to deliberately avoid offering details that would stress personal attachment between Trajan and the \"tyrant\" Domitian{{snds}}attributes to him, at the time, various (and unspecified) feats of arms.{{sfn|Bennett|2001|p=45\u201346}}\n\nSince Domitian's successor, Nerva, was unpopular with the army and had just been forced by his Praetorian Prefect [[Casperius Aelianus]] to execute Domitian's killers,{{sfn|Alston|2014|p=261}} he felt the need to gain the support of the military in order to avoid being ousted. He accomplished this in the summer of 97 by naming Trajan as his adoptive son and successor, allegedly solely on Trajan's outstanding military merits.{{sfn|Bennett|2001|p=45\u201346}} There are hints, however, in contemporary literary sources that Trajan's adoption was imposed on Nerva.

Potts, ed., ''Araby the Blest: Studies in Arabian Archaeology''.

Princeton University Press, 1995, {{ISBN|0-691-00170-7}}, page 15</ref>\n\nIn his Dacian conquests, Trajan had already resorted to Syrian auxiliary units, whose veterans, along with Syrian traders, had an important role in the subsequent colonization of Dacia.{{sfn|G\u0103zdac|2010|p=59}} He had recruited Palmyrene units into his army, including a camel unit,<ref>Pat Southern, ''Empress Zenobia: Palmyra's Rebel Queen''.

Officially declared by the [[Roman Senate|Senate]] ''optimus princeps'' (\"best ruler\"), Trajan is remembered as a successful soldier-emperor who presided over the greatest military expansion in [[Roman history]], leading the empire to attain its maximum territorial extent by the time of his death. He is also known for his [[philanthropic]] rule, overseeing extensive public [[#Building activities|building programs]] and implementing [[Alimenta|social welfare policies]], which earned him his enduring reputation as the second of the [[Five Good Emperors]] who presided over an era of peace and prosperity in the [[Mediterranean world]].\n\nTrajan was born in [[Italica]], close to modern [[Seville]] in present-day [[Spain]], an [[Italic peoples|Italic settlement]] in the [[Roman province]] of [[Hispania Baetica]]. Although misleadingly designated by some later writers as a provincial, [[Gens Ulpia|his family]] came from [[Roman Umbria|Umbria]] and he was born a Roman citizen.<ref name=\"Arnold Blumberg 1995, p.&nbsp;315\">Arnold Blumberg, ''Great Leaders, Great Tyrants? Contemporary Views of World Rulers who Made History'', 1995, Greenwood Publishing Group, p.&nbsp;315: \"Trajan is frequently but misleadingly designated the first provincial emperor, because the Ulpii were from Baetica (southern Spain). The family, resident in Spain for some time, originated in Italian Tuder, not far from the Flavian home of Reate. The emperor's father, M. Ulpius Traianus, was an early adherent of Vespasian and perhaps the old family friend. This Trajan evidently married a Marcia (her name is inferred from that of their daughter Marciana) whose family owned brickyards in the vicinity of Ameria, near both Reate and Tuder. She was possibly an older sister of Marcia Furnilla, second wife of Vespasian's son Titus. Further, Ulpia, sister of the senior Trajan, was a grandmother of Hadrian. In other words, the emperor Trajan was succeeded in 117 by his cousin, member of another Italian family resident in Baetica.\"</ref> Trajan rose to prominence during the reign of emperor [[Domitian]]. Serving as a [[legatus legionis]] in [[Hispania Tarraconensis]], in 89 Trajan supported Domitian against a revolt on the [[Rhine]] led by [[Antonius Saturninus]]. In September 96, Domitian was succeeded by the old and childless [[Nerva]], who proved to be unpopular with the army. After a brief and tumultuous year in power, culminating in a revolt by members of the [[Praetorian Guard]], he was compelled to adopt the more popular Trajan as his heir and successor. Nerva died in 98 and was succeeded by his adopted son without incident.\n\nAs a civilian administrator, Trajan is best known for his extensive public building program, which reshaped the city of [[Rome]] and left numerous enduring landmarks such as [[Trajan's Forum]], [[Trajan's Market]] and [[Trajan's Column]]. Early in his reign, he annexed the [[Nabataean Kingdom]], creating the province of [[Arabia Petraea]]. His conquest of [[Roman Dacia|Dacia]] enriched the empire greatly, as the new province possessed many valuable gold mines.\n\nTrajan's war against the [[Parthian Empire]] ended with the sack of the capital [[Ctesiphon]] and the annexation of [[Roman Armenia|Armenia]] and [[Mesopotamia (Roman province)|Mesopotamia]]. His campaigns expanded the Roman Empire to its greatest territorial extent. In late 117, while sailing back to Rome, Trajan fell ill and died of a [[stroke]] in the city of [[Selinus (Cilicia)|Selinus]]. He was [[deified]] by the Senate and his ashes were laid to rest under the Column. He was succeeded by his cousin [[Hadrian]], whom Trajan supposedly adopted on his deathbed.\n\n== Sources ==\n\nAs an emperor, Trajan's reputation has endured{{snds}}he is one of the few rulers whose reputation has survived nineteen centuries. Every new emperor after him was honoured by the Senate with the wish ''[[felicior Augusto, melior Traiano]]'' (that he be \"luckier than [[Augustus]] and better than Trajan\"). Among [[Middle Ages|medieval]] Christian theologians, Trajan was considered a [[virtuous pagan]]. In the [[Renaissance]], [[Machiavelli]], speaking on the advantages of adoptive succession over heredity, mentioned the five successive good emperors \"from Nerva to [[Marcus Aurelius|Marcus]]\"<ref>[[Discourses on Livy]], I, 10, 4</ref>{{snds}}a [[Trope (literature)|trope]] out of which the 18th-century historian [[Edward Gibbon]] popularized the notion of the [[Five Good Emperors]], of whom Trajan was the second.<ref>{{cite book|title=Idiots guide to the Roman Empire|last=Nelson|first=Eric|year=2002|publisher=Alpha Books|isbn= 978-0-02-864151-5|pages=207\u2013209}}</ref>\n\nAs far as ancient literary sources are concerned, an extant continuous account of Trajan's reign does not exist. An account of the [[Trajan's Dacian Wars|Dacian Wars]], the ''[[Dacica|Commentarii de bellis Dacicis]]'', written by Trajan himself or a [[ghostwriter]] and modelled after [[Gaius Julius Caesar|Caesar]]'s ''[[Commentarii de Bello Gallico]]'', is lost with the exception of one sentence. Only fragments remain of the ''Getica'', a book by Trajan's personal physician [[Titus Statilius Criton]]. The ''Parthica'', a 17-volume account of the [[Roman\u2013Parthian Wars|Parthian Wars]] written by [[Arrian]], has met a similar fate.{{sfn|Strobel|2010|p=14}} Book{{nbsp}}68 in [[Cassius Dio]]'s ''Roman History'', which survives mostly as [[Byzantine]] abridgments and [[epitome]]s, is the main source for the political history of Trajan's rule.{{sfn|Strobel|2010|p=15}} Besides this, [[Pliny the Younger|Pliny the Younger's]] ''Panegyricus'' and [[Dio Chrysostom|Dio of Prusa]]'s orations are the best surviving contemporary sources. Both are adulatory [[Dispositio#Peroratio|perorations]], typical of the High Imperial period, that describe an idealized monarch and an equally idealized view of Trajan's rule, and concern themselves more with ideology than with actual fact.{{sfn|Bennett|2001|pages=xii/xiii & 63}} The tenth volume of Pliny's letters contains his correspondence with Trajan, which deals with various aspects of imperial Roman government, but this correspondence is neither intimate nor candid: it is an exchange of official mail, in which Pliny's stance borders on the servile.<ref>Finley Hooper, ''Roman Realities''. [[Wayne State University Press]], 1979, {{ISBN|0-8143-1594-1}}, page 427</ref> It is certain that much of the text of the letters that appear in this collection over Trajan's signature was written and/or edited by Trajan's Imperial secretary, his ''[[ab epistulis]]''.<ref>Carlos F. Nore\u00f1a, \"The Social Economy of Pliny's Correspondence with Trajan\". ''American Journal of Philology'', 128 (2007) 239\u2013277, page 251</ref> Therefore, discussion of Trajan and his rule in modern historiography cannot avoid speculation. Non-literary sources such as archaeology, [[epigraphy]], and [[numismatics]] are also useful for reconstructing his reign.{{sfn|Bennett|2001|p=xiii}}\n\n== Early life and rise to power ==\n[[File:Imperator Caesar Nerva Traianus.jpg|thumb|275px|left|Modern statue of Nerva, [[Rome]], [[Italy]].]]\n[[File:Trajan2.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Denarius]] of Trajan, minted in Rome in 101{{ndash}}102 AD.

Although frequently designated the first provincial emperor, and dismissed by later writers such as Cassius Dio (himself of provincial origin) as \"an Iberian, and neither an Italian nor even an Italiot\", Trajan appears to have hailed on his father's side from the area of Tuder (modern [[Todi]]) in [[Roman Umbria|Umbria]], at the border with [[Etruria]], and on his mother's side from the [[Marcia (gens)|Gens Marcia]], of an Italic family of [[Sabines|Sabine]] origin. Trajan's birthplace of Italica was founded as a Roman military colony of ''Italian'' settlers in 206{{nbsp}}BC, though it is unknown when the Ulpii arrived there. It is possible, but cannot be substantiated, that Trajan's ancestors married local women and lost their citizenship at some point, but they certainly recovered their status when the city became a [[municipium]] with [[Latin citizenship]] in the mid-1st century BC.{{sfn|Bennett|2001|p=1\u20133}}<ref name=\"Arnold Blumberg 1995, p.&nbsp;315\"/>\n\nTrajan was the son of [[Marcia (mother of Trajan)|Marcia]], a Roman noblewoman and sister-in-law of the second Flavian Emperor [[Titus]],{{sfn|Strobel|2010|p=41}} and [[Marcus Ulpius Traianus (senior)|Marcus Ulpius Traianus]], a prominent senator and general from the ''[[Ulpia (gens)|gens Ulpia]]''. Marcus Ulpius Traianus the elder served [[Vespasian]] in the [[First Jewish-Roman War]], commanding the ''[[Legio X Fretensis|Legio X ''Fretensis'']]''.<ref>{{cite book|last=Goldsworthy|first=Adrian|title=In the name of Rome: The men who won the Roman Empire|date=2003|publisher=Weidenfeld & Nicolson|location=London|page=320}}</ref> Trajan himself was just one of many well-known Ulpii in a line that continued long after his own death. His elder sister was [[Ulpia Marciana]], and his niece was [[Salonina Matidia]]. The ''[[Homeland|patria]]'' of the Ulpii was Italica, in Spanish Baetica.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\" />\n\nAs a young man, he rose through the ranks of the [[Roman army]], serving in some of the most contested parts of the Empire's frontier. In 76{{ndash}}77, Trajan's father was [[Roman governor|Governor]] of [[Syria (Roman province)|Syria]] (''[[Legatus]] pro praetore Syriae''), where Trajan himself remained as ''[[Tribunus]] legionis''. From there, after his father's replacement, he seems to have been transferred to an unspecified Rhine province, and Pliny implies that he engaged in active combat duty during both commissions.{{sfn|Bennett|2001|p=22\u201323}} In about 86, Trajan's cousin [[Publius Aelius Hadrianus Afer|P.{{nbsp}}Aelius Afer]] died, leaving his young children [[Hadrian]] and [[Paulina (sister of Hadrian)|Paulina]] orphans. Trajan and a colleague of his, [[Publius Acilius Attianus]], became co-guardians of the two children.{{sfn|Garzetti|2014|p=378}}\n\nIn 91, Trajan was created ordinary [[Consul]] for the year, which was a great honour as he was in his late thirties and therefore just above the minimum legal age (32) for holding the post. This can be explained in part by the prominence of his father's career, as his father had been instrumental to the ascent of the ruling [[Flavian dynasty]], held consular rank himself and had just been made a [[patrician (ancient Rome)|patrician]].{{sfn|Bennett|2001|p=13}} Around this time Trajan brought [[Apollodorus of Damascus]] with him to [[Rome]].<ref name=\"2.5\u20136\">Augustan History, ''Life of Hadrian'' [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Historia_Augusta/Hadrian/1*.html#2.5 2.5\u20136]</ref> and also married [[Pompeia Plotina]], a noble woman from the Roman settlement at [[N\u00eemes]]; the marriage ultimately remained childless.<ref>{{cite encyclopedia|url=https://www.britannica.com/biography/Pompeia-Plotina|title=Pompei Plotina|encyclopedia=Britannica|accessdate=26 January 2017}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Perge - Trajan.jpg|thumb|left|Trajan wearing the [[civic crown]] and military garb such as a [[muscle cuirass]], 2nd century AD, [[Antalya Museum|Antalya Archaeological Museum]]]]\nIt has been remarked by authors such as [[Julian (emperor)|Julian]] and Cassius Dio that Trajan was personally inclined towards [[Homosexuality in ancient Rome|homosexuality]]. Trajan's putative lovers included [[Hadrian]], pages of the imperial household, the actor Pylades, a dancer called Apolaustus, and senator [[Lucius Licinius Sura]].{{sfn|Bennett|2001|p=58}}\n\nAs the details of Trajan's military career are obscure, it is only sure that in 89, as legate of [[Legio VII Gemina]] in [[Hispania Tarraconensis]], he supported Domitian against an attempted ''coup''.{{sfn|Bennett|2001|p=43}} Later, after his 91 consulate (held with [[Manius Acilius Glabrio (consul 91)|Acilius Glabrio]], a rare pair of consuls at the time, in that neither consul was a member of the ruling dynasty), he held some unspecified consular commission as governor on either [[Pannonia]] or [[Germania Superior]]{{snds}}possibly both.

Pliny implied as much when he wrote that, although an emperor could not be coerced into doing something, if this were the way in which Trajan was raised to power, then it was worth it. Alice K\u00f6nig argues that the notion of a natural continuity between Nerva's and Trajan's reigns was an ''ex post facto'' fiction developed by authors writing under Trajan, like [[Tacitus]] and [[Pliny the Younger|Pliny]].<ref>Jason K\u00f6nig, Tim Whitmarsh, eds., ''Ordering Knowledge in the Roman Empire''.

Princeton University Press, 1995, {{ISBN|0-691-00170-7}}, page 15</ref>\n\nIn his Dacian conquests, Trajan had already resorted to Syrian auxiliary units, whose veterans, along with Syrian traders, had an important role in the subsequent colonization of Dacia.{{sfn|G\u0103zdac|2010|p=59}} He had recruited Palmyrene units into his army, including a camel unit,<ref>Pat Southern, ''Empress Zenobia: Palmyra's Rebel Queen''.
