{"title_page": "Eopsin", "text_new": "'''Eopsin''' ({{Korean|\uc5c5\uc2e0|hanja=\u696d\u795e}}) is the goddess of the storage and wealth in [[Korean mythology]] and [[Korean shamanism|shamanism]]. She is one of the [[Gasin]], or deities that protect the house. However, unlike other Gasin, who were believed to embody pots, paper, and other inanimate objects, Eopsin is special in that she appears in an animal form. This is because Koreans considered snakes and weasels, who ate mice and rats, holy.\n\n== Etymology ==\nBecause throughout Korean history, scholars used Chinese characters, Eopsin is represented through '\u696d\u795e'.

Rarely, Eopsin was believed to be [[cattle]], [[pig]]s, [[rooster]]s, or [[dog]]s. There are even records of Ineob, or Eopsin taking the form of a human.\n\nKoreans believed that they had to worship Eopsin (along with [[Teojusin]]) to be rich, as she was the goddess of the storage, which held money. Thus, Koreans did not harm or chase away rat snakes or weasels, even when they entered the house. When the rat snake, weasel, toad, et cetera left the household, it was believed that Eopsin had abandoned the house. Because the lack of Eopsin was believed to cause [[bankruptcy]], Koreans prevented the animals from leaving the household.\n\nIn some regions, the people believed that Eopsin embodied a pot called the Eob Hangari. The family placed rice inside the pot (like the Seongju Danji of Seongjusin) and covered it with a straw umbrella (like the Teojutgari of the [[Teojusin]]).<ref>http://terms.naver.com/entry.nhn?docId=581047&mobile&categoryId=1627</ref>\n\nIn poor households that lacked a storage, Koreans wove two straw baskets.

The deity '''Eobseongjo''' ([[Hangul]]: \uc5c5\uc131\uc870, [[Hanja]]: \u696d\u6210\u9020) is a mixture of Eopsin and Seongjusin (god of the house), and the deity '''Eobdaegam''' ([[Hangul]]: \uc5c5\ub300\uac10) is a mixture of Eopsin and [[Teojusin]] (goddess of the earth).<ref>http://terms.naver.com/entry.nhn?docId=581047&mobile&categoryId=1627</ref>\n\n== In Jeju Island ==\nIn [[Jeju Island]], the wealth goddess is Chilseongsin.

However, when the girl bore a child through [[premarital sex]], the child was thrown to the seas in an iron box. In her long journey on the seas, the girl turned into a snake. The girl gave birth to seven children, who were also snakes.\n\nThe iron box floated around the coast of Jeju Island, but the gods of the coastal villages kept the box away from their villages. When the iron box reached Hamdeok Village in Jeju Island, the people there were frightened by the reptilian snake-girl and abandoned her. The snake-girl then cursed Hamdeok, and all the people of Hamdeok went sick. They finally knew that the girl was a goddess. As a result, the people worshipped the girl instead of the village patron deity, Seomul Halmang.\n\nSeomul Halmang chased the snake-girl away, and the snake-girl secretly fled to Jeju Fortress. There, she followed the wife of the Song family. The snake-girl blessed the Songs, and the family became the richest family on earth. When the rest of Jeju Island heard of this, they worshipped the snake-girl and her children. The snake-girl and her seven children became gods.\n\nThe snake-girl and her seventh child became the two Chilseongsin, the two storage gods.
