It links to the Hydro-Qu\u00e9bec Trans\u00c9nergie grid at the Les C\u00e8dres substation in Quebec. It also links to the National Grid Dennison substation in [[New York (state)|New York]] state.  The line was rebuilt in 2003 and currently operates at 120-kV.  It is capable of operating at 230-kV with a capacity of 1,000 megawatts.  The transmission line is operated by the Cedars Rapids Transmission Company Limited, a subsidiary of the [[State-owned enterprise|crown corporation]] [[Hydro-Qu\u00e9bec]].\n\n== History ==\n[[File:Cornwall Electric Street Railway Company car No. 10, G.T.R. & Water Street, Ontario Voiture no 10 de la Cornwall Electric Street Railway Company, Grand Trunk Railway et rue Water (Ontario) (36520200630).jpg|thumb|Cornwall Electric Street Railway Company car No. 10]]\nIn 1887, the ''Stormont Electric Light & Power Company'' was formed to supply electricity to Cornwall.  Almost a decade later in 1896, the ''Cornwall Electric Street Railway Company'' was incorporated after obtaining a franchise to operate a streetcar service from the Town of Cornwall.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://home.cc.umanitoba.ca/~wyatt/alltime/cornwall-on.html|title=Transit History of Cornwall, Ontario|website=home.cc.umanitoba.ca|access-date=2020-04-04}}</ref>  The service began on 1 July 1896 using an electric locomotive and four cars traveling on what was approximately three miles of track.  In 1897, two additional cars were purchased.  A year later, to generate additional revenues, the company started a freight service.  That service would move freight from the [[Grand Trunk Railway]] yards, and from the [[New York and Ottawa Railway]] to the Toronto Paper Company, Canadian Coloured Cottons, and other local businesses, including the town's local post office.\n\nIn 1898, the [[Sun Life Assurance Company of Canada]] became a [[bondholder]] of ''Cornwall Electric Street Railway Company''.  In 1902, the company which was facing financial difficulties with its freight service operations defaulted on its debt, giving Sun Life full ownership.  In 1905, Sun Life now itself struggling with the railway business, purchased the ''Stormont Electric Light & Power Company'' and would amalgamate both companies into a new one called ''Cornwall Street Railway Light and Power Company Limited.''  With the combined operations, it could now provide the distribution of electricity to power its passenger and freight switching service, and distribute electricity to power lights and heat.  The company would later provide its customers with hot water by selling hot water heaters, powered using its electricity paid for by its customers using a [[flat rate]] billing system. The flat rate system was later discontinued and the sale of hot water heaters abandoned.   \n\nIn 1957, the City of Cornwall formed a committee which was appointed to do what would be its first look at purchasing the utility.  Forty years later in 1977, [[city council]] under the leadership of Mayor Gerald Parisien decided to purchase the company from Sun Life for CA$4.8 million.<ref name=\":0\" /> Later that year, the City of Cornwall appointed members to its first board of directors.  They were Gerald Parisien, Gordon Fairweather, Albert Bergeron, Fred Bradley, Neil Burke, and Doug Fawthrop.  Ten years later in 1987, ''Cornwall Street Railway Light and Power Company Limited'', operating as ''Cornwall Electric'', expanded and acquired the ''St. Lawrence Power Company'' also located in Cornwall for CA$13.5 million.\n\n=== Privatization ===\nIn 1997, and only twenty years after purchasing the utility that some would refer to as the city's \"crown jewel\", city council voted 10-1 to accept an offer from [[Consumer's Gas Company|Consumer's Gas Company Ltd.]] to purchase ''Cornwall Street Railway Light and Power Company Limited'' for CA$68 million.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.standard-freeholder.com/news/local-news/a-look-at-the-history-of-the-privatization-of-cornwall-electric-21-years-later|title=A look at the history of the privatization of Cornwall Electric, 21 years later|last=September 26|first=Alan S.

During the prolonged ice storm, much of [[Eastern Ontario]] and [[Western Quebec]] was without electricity.  Although the City of Cornwall straddles the banks of the [[Saint Lawrence River|Saint-Lawrence River]] which supplies water to the neighboring  [[R. H. Saunders Station|R.H. Saunders Power Generating Station]], no electricity ever flowed from it to the city.  Existing wires connecting the [[Moses-Saunders Power Dam]] to the city were for the first time energized with electricity generated by the local power plant.  Two of the three wires were weighted down with ice and dangerously close.  A Cornwall Electric employee who was also an archer, used a [[bow and arrow]] to throw a line over the arcing wires.  It allowed workers to bounce the wires, causing the ice to fall off and the lines to separate from each other.  This permitted [[Ontario Hydro]], with its local hydroelectric power generating station, to provide Cornwall Electric and Cornwall residents, with enough power to meet seventy-five percent of its electricity needs during the ice storm.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n=== Progress Fund ===\nAfter paying off the city's debt with the sale of Cornwall Electric, the City created the Progress Fund with the remaining proceeds.

The cost of the project was CA$3 million.  The cost of financing the project would be recouped from energy savings and  lower maintenance fees.  The city also announced that it would be switching its street traffic lights to LED at a rate of two intersections per year.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.cornwallseawaynews.com/2016/04/11/5000-city-street-lights-being-replaced-with-led/|title=5,000 city street lights being replaced with LED|date=2016-04-11|website=Cornwall Seaway News|language=en-US|access-date=2020-04-03}}</ref> In 2017, [[Hydro One]] converted the Township of Glengarry to LED bulbs at a cost of CA$226 thousand, yielding a cost savings of sixty-nine percent, and collecting CA$259 thousand in savings in the first three years.\n\n=== Controversy ===\nIn 2019 the Township of Glengarry wanted Cornwall Electric to convert its sub-division of Glen Walter to LED lighting.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.cornwallnewswatch.com/2019/03/12/glen-walter-held-hostage-to-old-streetlights/|title=Glen Walter held hostage to old streetlights|last=Editor|date=2019-03-12|website=Cornwall Newswatch|language=en-US|access-date=2020-04-06}}</ref> At a special council meeting on 24 January 2020, Councillor Sam McDonell raised the idea of not paying its electricity bill, as a way to bring Cornwall Electric to the table to discuss the matter. In an email published in the [[Cornwall Seaway News]], the councillor stated: \"''The big issue is this is a real savings that once we have transferred maintenance and future replacement cost to reserves we can then pass that savings along to rate payers, who in fact have these lights worked into their property taxes.

The city also announced that it would be switching its street traffic lights to LED at a rate of two intersections per year.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.cornwallseawaynews.com/2016/04/11/5000-city-street-lights-being-replaced-with-led/|title=5,000 city street lights being replaced with LED|date=2016-04-11|website=Cornwall Seaway News|language=en-US|access-date=2020-04-03}}</ref> In 2017, [[Hydro One]] converted the Township of Glengarry to LED bulbs at a cost of CA$226 thousand, yielding a cost savings of sixty-nine percent, and collecting CA$259 thousand in savings in the first three years.\n\n=== Controversy ===\nIn 2019 the Township of Glengarry wanted Cornwall Electric to convert its sub-division of Glen Walter to LED lighting.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.cornwallnewswatch.com/2019/03/12/glen-walter-held-hostage-to-old-streetlights/|title=Glen Walter held hostage to old streetlights|last=Editor|date=2019-03-12|website=Cornwall Newswatch|language=en-US|access-date=2020-04-06}}</ref> At a special council meeting on 24 January 2020, Councillor Sam McDonell raised the idea of not paying its electricity bill, as a way to bring Cornwall Electric to the table to discuss the matter. In an email published in the [[Cornwall Seaway News]], the councillor stated: \"''The big issue is this is a real savings that once we have transferred maintenance and future replacement cost to reserves we can then pass that savings along to rate payers, who in fact have these lights worked into their property taxes.

Raga belongs to the [[East Vanuatu languages]], a branch of the [[Austronesian languages]] family. In old sources the language is sometimes referred to by the names of villages in which it is spoken, such as Bwatvenua (Qatvenua), Lamalanga, Vunmarama and Loltong.\n\nWith an estimated 6,500 native speakers (in the year 2000), Raga is the second most widely spoken of Pentecost's five native languages (after [[Apma language|Apma]]), and the seventh largest vernacular in Vanuatu as a whole. There are significant communities of Raga speakers on [[Maewo]] island and in [[Port Vila]] and [[Luganville]] as a result of emigration from Pentecost.\n\nThe Raga spoken by most people today is heavily mixed with [[Bislama]], Vanuatu's national language. The [[Turaga nation|Turaga indigenous movement]], based at Lavatmanggemu in north-eastern Pentecost, have attempted to purge the language of foreign influences by coining or rediscovering native words for introduced concepts such as \"torch battery\" (''vat bongbongi'', literally \"night stones\") and \"hour\" (''ngguha'', literally \"movement\"). Members of the Turaga movement write in Raga language using [[Avoiuli]], a unique writing system inspired by local sand drawings.\n\nRaga is generally considered an easy language to speak and learn, and is known as a second language by a number of speakers of other Vanuatu languages.\n\nModern Raga is relatively homogeneous, with no significant dialectal variation. A distinctive southern dialect of Raga, '''Nggasai''', is now extinct; its last native speaker died in 1999.\n\nSeveral grammatical sketches, vocabulary lists and short papers on Raga have been published, beginning with the work of [[Robert Henry Codrington|R H Codrington]] and [[Hans Conon von der Gabelentz|von der Gabelentz]] in the late 19th century, and a number of religious texts have been translated into the language. However, no thorough description of Raga has ever been published.\n\n==Phonology==\nThe [[consonants]] of Raga are as follows,\n\n{| class=\"wikitable IPA\"\n|+Raga consonants\n! !!Labial!!Labialized<br>labial!!Alveolar!!Velar!!Glottal\n|-\n!Nasal\n|m ||m\u02b7 ||n ||{{IPAlink|\u014b}} {{angle bracket|n\u0304}}\n|-\n!Voiced plosive\n|b~p {{angle bracket|b}} ||b\u02b7 ||d ||\u1d51\u0261 {{angle bracket|\u1e21}}\n|-\n!Voiceless plosive\n| || ||t ||k\n|-\n!(Voiced) fricative\n|v~f {{angle bracket|v}} ||v\u02b7 ~ f\u02b7 ||  ||{{IPAlink|\u0263}}~{{IPAlink|x}} {{angle bracket|g}} ||\n|-\n!Voiceless fricative\n| || ||s || ||h\n|-\n!Sonorant\n| ||w ||l, r ||\n|}\n\nIn this article, the sounds {{IPAslink|\u014b}} and {{IPAslink|\u1d51\u0261}} (like the ''ng'' of 'singer' and 'finger', respectively), which are written ''n\u0304'' and ''\u1e21'' in standard orthography, will be written ''ng'' and ''ngg''. ''G'' is typically pronounced like the ''ch'' in Scottish \"loch\". \n\n[[Prenasalized consonant|Prenasalization]] of the voiced plosives, such that ''b'' becomes ''mb'' (always voiced) and ''d'' becomes ''nd'', occurs when the preceding consonant is nasal (''m'', ''n'' or ''ng''). Thus ''mabu'' \"rest\" is pronounced ''mambu''.\n\n''V, vw'' are [[labiodental]], unlike in [[Apma language|Apma]] to the immediate south, where they are bilabial {{IPA|[\u03b2, \u03b2\u02b7]}}. Descriptions describe ''v'' as {{IPA|[v]}} and ''g'' as {{IPA|[x]}} more commonly than as {{IPA|[f]}} or {{IPA|[\u0263]}}, but there is evidently some variation.\n\nRaga has the five basic [[vowels]] '''a''', '''e''', '''i''', '''o''' and '''u'''. Vowels are not generally distinguished for length.\n\nWord roots in Raga nearly always end with a vowel. However, word-final vowels are often dropped within phrases, so that, for example, ''tanga'' \"basket\" and ''maita'' \"white\" combine to make ''tang maita'' \"white basket\".\n\nStress occurs on the penultimate syllable of a word.\n\n==Grammar==\nBasic word order in Raga is [[subject\u2013verb\u2013object]].\n\n===Pronouns===\nPersonal pronouns are distinguished by [[Grammatical person|person]] and [[Grammatical number|number]]. They are not distinguished by [[Grammatical gender|gender]]. The basic pronouns are as follows:\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n! Person || Raga || English\n|--\n| 1st person singular || ''inau'' || \"me\"\n|--\n| 2nd person singular || ''ginggo'' || \"you\" (singular)\n|--\n| 3rd person singular || ''kea'' || \"him / her / it\" \n|--\n| 1st person dual (inclusive)|| ''gidaru'' || \"us\" (you and me, two of us) \n|--\n| 1st person dual (exclusive)|| ''kamaru'' || \"us\" (me and another) \n|--\n| 2nd person dual|| ''kimiru'' || \"you (two)\" \n|--\n| 1st person plural (inclusive) || ''gida'' || \"us\" (you and me)\n|--\n| 1st person plural (exclusive)|| ''kamai'' || \"us\" (me and others) \n|--\n| 2nd person plural|| ''kimiu'' || \"you\" (plural)\n|--\n| 3rd person dual/plural || ''kera'' || \"them\" \n|}\n\n===Nouns===\n[[Plural]]ity is indicated by placing ''ira'' before a noun:\n\n:''manu'' = [the] bird\n:''ira manu'' = [the] birds\n\nNouns may be suffixed to indicate whom an item belongs to. For example:\n\n:''iha'' = name\n:''iha'''ku''''' = my name\n:''iha'''mwa''''' = your name\n:''iha'''na''''' = his/her name\n:''iha'''n''' ratahigi'' = the chief's name\n\nPossession may also be indicated by the use of '''possessive classifiers''', separate words that occur before the noun and take possessive suffixes. These classifiers are:\n\n*''no-'' for general possessions (''nonggu tanga'', \"my basket\")\n*''bila-'' for things that are cared for, such as crops and livestock (''bilada boe'', \"our pig\")\n*''ga-'' for things to be eaten (''gam bweta'', \"your taro\")\n*''ma-'' for things to be drunk (''mara wai'', \"their water\")\n\nHistorically there was also a classifier ''wa-'' for sugarcane to be chewed (''wan toi'', \"his sugarcane\"); this has fallen out of use among younger speakers.\n\nThe possessive suffixes are as follows:\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n! Person || Raga || English\n|--\n| 1st person singular || ''-ku'' or ''-nggu'' || \"of mine\" \n|--\n| 2nd person singular || ''-mwa'' || \"of yours\" (singular)\n|--\n| 3rd person singular || ''-na'' || \"of his/hers/its\"\n|--\n| 1st person dual (inclusive)|| ''-daru'' || \"of ours\" (yours and mine, two of us)\n|--\n| 1st person dual (exclusive)|| ''-maru'' || \"of ours\" (mine and another's)\n|--\n| 2nd person dual || ''-miru'' || \"of yours\" (two of you)\n|--\n| 1st person plural (inclusive)|| ''-da'' || \"of ours\" (yours and mine)\n|--\n| 1st person plural (exclusive)|| ''-mai'' || \"of ours\" (mine and others')\n|--\n| 2nd person plural|| ''-miu'' || \"of yours\" (plural)\n|--\n| 3rd person dual/plural|| ''-ra'' || \"of theirs\"\n|--\n| Generic || ''-i'' || -\n|}\n\nA verb may be transformed into a noun by the addition of a '''nominalising suffix''' ''-ana'':\n\n:''bwalo'' = to fight (verb)\n:''bwaloana'' = a fight (noun)\n\nModifiers generally come after a noun:\n\n:''vanua'' = island\n:''vanua kolo'' = small island\n:''vanua gairua'' = two islands\n\n===Verbs===\nVerbs in Raga are usually preceded by a subject pronoun and by a marker indicating the [[Grammatical tense|tense]], [[Grammatical aspect|aspect]] and [[Grammatical mood|mood]] of the action.\n\nThe subject pronouns are as follows:\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n! Person || Raga || English\n|--\n| 1st person singular || ''na-'' || \"I\"\n|--\n| 2nd person singular || ''go-'' || \"you\" (singular)\n|--\n| 1st person plural (inclusive)|| ''ta-'' || \"we\" (you and I)\n|--\n| 1st person plural (exclusive)|| ''ga-'' || \"we\" (others and I)\n|--\n| 2nd person plural|| ''gi-'' || \"you\" (plural)\n|--\n| 3rd person plural|| ''ra-'' || \"they\"\n|}\n\nThere is no 3rd person singular subject pronoun (\"he/she/it\").\n\nRaga has five sets of tense/aspect/mood markers:\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n! Tense / Aspect / Mood || Used for || Marker (full form) || Marker (short form)\n|--\n| '''Imperfective''' || Actions in the present tense<br/>Temporary or changing states || ''mwa'' || ''-m''\n|--\n| '''Perfective''' || Actions in the past tense<br/>Fixed states || ''nu'' || ''-n''\n|--\n| '''Potential''' || Things that may happen in the future || ''vi'' || ''-v'' or ''-i''\n|--\n| '''Prospective''' || Things that are about to happen || ''men'' || ''-men'' \n|--\n| '''Hypothetical''' || Things that have not happened and probably won't || ''si'' || ''-s'' \n|}\n\nThe full forms of these markers are used in the 3rd person singular, when there is usually no subject pronoun:\n\n:'''''mwa''' lolia'' = he does it\n:'''''nu''' lolia'' = he did it\n:'''''vi''' lolia'' = he will do it\n\nElsewhere, short forms of these markers are suffixed to the subject pronoun:\n\n:''na'''m''' lolia'' = I do it\n:''na'''n''' lolia'' = I did it\n:''na'''v''' lolia'' = I will do it\n\nThere are also '''dual''' (two-person) forms incorporating a particle ''ru'' \"two\":\n\n:''ram lolia'' = they do it\n:''ramu'''ru''' lolia'' = the two of them do it\n\nHistorically there were '''trial''' (three-person) forms incorporating a particle ''dol'' or ''tol'', but these have fallen out of use.\n\nThere is a pattern of [[Consonant mutation|verb-consonant mutation]] whereby ''v'' at the start of a verb changes to ''b'', ''vw'' to ''bw'', ''g'' to ''ngg'', and ''t'' to ''d''. This mutation occurs in imperfective aspect, and in the presence of the additive marker ''mom'':\n\n:''nan '''v'''ano'' = I went\n:''nam '''b'''ano'' = I am going\n\n[[Negation (linguistics)|Negative]] sentences are indicated with the two-part marker ''hav...te(he)'' \"not\", which encloses the verb and anything suffixed to it:\n\n:''nan '''hav''' lolia '''tehe''''' = I didn't do it\n\nThe [[Voice (grammar)|passive voice]] can be formed by attaching the suffix ''-ana'' to the verb:\n\n:''nu lolia'' = he did it\n:''nu loli'''ana''''' = it was done\n\nThe direct object immediately follows the verb. Some object pronouns take the form of suffixes attached to the verb:\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n! Person || Raga || English\n|--\n| 1st person singular || ''-(a)u'' || \"me\"\n|--\n| 2nd person singular || ''-go'' || \"you\" (singular)\n|--\n| 3rd person singular (or inanimate plural) || ''-a'' or ''-e'' || \"him\" / \"her\" / \"it\" (or \"them\")\n|--\n| 3rd person plural (animate) || ''-ra'' || \"them\"\n|}\n\nIn some cases a particle ''-ni-'' interposes between the verb and the object pronoun:\n\n:''nam doro'''ni'''a'' = I like it\n\n==Sample phrases==\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!

This mutation occurs in imperfective aspect, and in the presence of the additive marker ''mom'':\n\n:''nan '''v'''ano'' = I went\n:''nam '''b'''ano'' = I am going\n\n[[Negation (linguistics)|Negative]] sentences are indicated with the two-part marker ''hav...te(he)'' \"not\", which encloses the verb and anything suffixed to it:\n\n:''nan '''hav''' lolia '''tehe''''' = I didn't do it\n\nThe [[Voice (grammar)|passive voice]] can be formed by attaching the suffix ''-ana'' to the verb:\n\n:''nu lolia'' = he did it\n:''nu loli'''ana''''' = it was done\n\nThe direct object immediately follows the verb. Some object pronouns take the form of suffixes attached to the verb:\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!
