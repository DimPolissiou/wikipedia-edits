It is the fourth title in the ''[[Saints Row]]'' series. In the game, the [[playable character]] is the leader of the 3rd Street Saints, a [[street gang]] that has become the world's most powerful and popular organization, and must fend off an alien invasion after becoming [[President of the United States]] and receiving [[Superpower (ability)|superpower]]s. The player is free to explore their environment while completing main and side [[Level (video gaming)|missions]] at their leisure. The game incorporates elements from science fiction video games and films, and continues the series' reputation for over-the-top [[parody]]. It was released in August 2013 for [[Microsoft Windows]], [[PlayStation 3]], and [[Xbox 360]], and was later [[Porting of video games|ported]] to [[PlayStation 4]], [[Xbox One]], and [[Linux]] in 2015. A [[Nintendo Switch]] port was released on March 27, 2020.\n\nThe game was Volition's first after its sale to [[Koch Media]] in early 2013. The supernatural and superpower concept for the game started in ''[[Enter the Dominatrix]]'', a cancelled [[expansion pack|expansion]] planned for ''[[Saints Row: The Third]]'', which the team expanded into ''Saints Row IV''. Volition later released a \"director's cut\" of ''Enter the Dominatrix'' as [[downloadable content]] for ''Saints Row IV'' alongside ''How the Saints Saved Christmas'', other weapons, costumes, and vehicle packs, and a standalone expansion, ''[[Saints Row: Gat out of Hell]]'' (which serves as the epilogue to the story). ''Saints Row IV'' received several limited and summative edition releases, and was briefly banned in Australia. Critics praised ''Saints Row IV''{{'s}} humor and character customization options, but criticized its lack of challenge. It sold over one million copies in its first week.\n\n== Gameplay ==\n\nSimilar to previous ''[[Saints Row]]'' series games,{{r|IGN: review}} ''Saints Row IV'' is an [[open world]] [[action game]] with [[third-person shooter]] elements wherein the player is free to explore the environment and, at their leisure, play story or side [[Level (video gaming)|missions]].{{r|Polygon: review}} As the leader of the Saints, a [[street gang]] that has become the world's most \"powerful and popular\" organization, the player is elected [[President of the United States]], receives [[Superpower (ability)|superpowers]], and fends off an [[alien invasion]].{{r|Polygon: review}} Most often the player will engage in shooting and racing activities, though other activities vary from fighting crowds of zombies, shoot-outs in tanks,{{r|Polygon: review}} [[side-scrolling]] [[brawlers]], fights against supersized, [[daikaiju]] [[energy drink]] cans, and using a [[dubstep]] gun to interrupt 1950s [[Americana]].{{r|Eurogamer: review}} The player-character receives elemental powers and superpowers that greatly increase their jump height and running speed, such that the player can hop over buildings and outrun vehicles.{{r|Polygon: review}} The elemental powers include abilities to shoot fire and ice projectiles, [[telekinetic]]ally toss things, and create shockwaves upon landing jumps.{{r|Eurogamer: review}}  As the player progresses through the game, they can optionally upgrade their abilities and weapons [[skill tree]]{{r|Polygon: review}} by using collectible \"data clusters\" scattered around town.{{r|Eurogamer: review}} If the player becomes too rowdy, the alien race's police analogue will intervene.{{r|Eurogamer: review}} As in previous games, the player-character's look and feel is entirely customizable via a robust character editor feature.{{r|IGN: review}}\n\nThe game is set in a nearly identical{{r|IGN: review}} simulation of Steelport, the fictional city setting from ''[[Saints Row: The Third]]'',{{r|Eurogamer: review}} though individual story missions have new, custom-designed [[Level (video gaming)|levels]].{{r|IGN: review}} ''Saints Row IV''{{'s}} story parodies science fiction video games, especially ''[[Mass Effect 2]]'', as well as films like ''[[The Matrix]]'' and ''[[Zero Dark Thirty]]'', and other \"nerd culture\".{{r|Polygon: review}} Some story missions are propelled by individual characters' existential crises,{{r|Polygon: review}} as each Saint character is stuck in a personal simulation of their own hell, and must be rescued by the player.{{r|Eurogamer: review}} Other elements borrowed from video game culture include [[BioWare]]-style character romances games and a ''[[Metal Gear]]''-style mission with an unhelpful partner.{{r|Eurogamer: review}}\n\nCity districts are \"liberated\" from alien occupation as the player completes side missions in occupied districts.{{r|Eurogamer: review}} Liberated districts increase the player's hourly income, which can be spent on weapons, skills, and perks. Side missions include Insurance Fraud (where the player jumps into traffic to collect insurance money),{{r|Eurogamer: review}} [[demolition derby]]-style Mayhem, and superpowered foot races. ''Saints Row IV'' has a two-player [[Cooperative gameplay|cooperative]] mode.{{r|IGN: review}}\n\n== Plot ==\nA few months after the events of ''[[Saints Row: The Third]]'', the 3rd Street Saints are called to assist [[Secret Intelligence Service|MI-6]] agent Asha Odekar and former Deckers leader Matt Miller in foiling a plot by former STAG leader Cyrus Temple. The Boss and their top lieutenants, Shaundi and Pierce Washington, breach Cyrus' base with Asha, killing him, and preventing a nuclear missile hitting [[Washington, D.C.|Washington D.C.]], earning the adoration of America. Five years later, the Boss becomes elected [[President of the United States]], receiving [[Keith David]] as his adviser, while assigning his cabinet roles to various Saints members and former Vice Kings leader Benjamin King. Moments into a press conference, [[Earth]] is hit by an [[alien invasion|invasion]] from the Zin, led by the warlord Zinyak, who destroy the [[White House]] and abduct the Boss, Keith, and most of the cabinet.\n\nAfter the Boss escapes from a computer simulation based on a 1950s [[sitcom]] environment, aided by hacker specialist Kinzie Kensington, they find themselves brought into a virtual recreation of Steelport. Working to manipulate the environment with special powers, they eventually reunite with Kenzie and Keith within a stolen Zin ship. When the group try to contact other Saints for help, Zinyak prevents this by destroying the Earth. Enraged, the Boss re-enters the Steelport simulation to find the others that the Zin abducted, rescuing each from simulations based on their personal nightmares. Zinyak responds by having the Steelport simulation flooded with copies of gang members the Boss faced in the past, which causes Kinzie to suspect he is drawing these from the memories of someone else. The Boss quickly deduces that the Zin must have abducted Johnny Gat, a lieutenant of the Saints who was presumed dead, and rescues him from his own simulation.\n\nThe Saints soon rally inside the simulation to confront Zinyak, only for Kinzie to be captured in the real world by Zin forces. Discovering that Keith betrayed them, the Boss confronts him and learns he did so in exchange for the Zin restoring the Earth. After pursuing him through his own personal nightmare, the Boss reveals to Keith he was tricked, and convinces him to rejoin the Saints. Learning where Kinzie was taken, the Boss rescues her from her personal nightmare. With the group back in operations, Kinzie discovers a plan to board Zinyak's ship by overloading the Steelport simulation to create an opening. Upon the Saints achieving this, the Boss boards Zinyak's ship, steals [[power armor]] that emulates their powers from the simulation, and uses it to kill Zinyak in front of the Zin, taking control of their empire.\n\nThe game's loyalty missions impact the ending of the story: if a number of these are not completed, the Boss makes plans for the Saints to take over more planets and expand their new empire; however, if all are completed, the Saints learn that they can restore Earth using [[time-travel]], discovering that Zinyak captured several historical figures and placed them in [[suspended animation]]. The Boss soon discovers one of them to be 19th century writer [[Jane Austen]], whom they are a fan of, and who reveals herself as the narrator of the game's story once she is awaken her from stasis.\n\n== Development ==\nAfter the release of ''Saints Row: The Third'', preliminary work on a game called ''Saints Row: Part Four'' began. The game would take place after the events of ''The Third'' in a new city and feature gameplay similar to ''The Third''.<ref>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bXKeOTo9AH0</ref> Meanwhile, a [[standalone expansion]] to ''The Third'' called ''Enter the Dominatrix'' was first announced as a 2012 [[April Fool's]] joke,{{r|Ginf: April Fool's}} but still went into development. The [[expansion pack]]'s basic concept included a superpowered player-character trapped by alien commander Zinyak in a simulation of Steelport.{{r|Polygon: Dominatrix}} With [[THQ]] suffering financially, its president Jason Rubin encouraged company subsidiary and ''Saints Row'' series developer [[Volition (company)|Volition]] to grow elements from the expansion into a full game.{{r|Polygon: Volition}} The company announced this change in direction in June 2012,{{r|Polygon: merging}} cancelling ''Saints Row: Part Four'' and expanding ''Enter the Dominatrix'' into a full sequel, ''Saints Row IV''.{{r|Polygon: Volition}} The company's strategy was partly to avoid sales issues by releasing the game in August 2013, prior to the circulation of rumors about [[History of video game consoles (eighth generation)|next generation]] video game consoles.{{r|Polygon: Volition}} Volition was sold to [[Koch Media]] in early 2013 when its parent company, THQ, filed for bankruptcy. It became Koch's first internal video game studio. The studio officially announced ''Saints Row IV'' two months later, which was published by Koch Media brand [[Deep Silver]]. Acquired without rights to their ''[[Red Faction]]'' series, Volition's new goals were to make connected, open world games where \"the player is an agent of mayhem\". The entire company worked on the one game.{{r|Polygon: Volition}}\n\nEach of the ''Saints Row'' series games had a core intent, and while the first three games built on the first's \"outlandishness and irreverence\", the fourth focused on \"the [[supernatural]] and superpowers\".{{r|Polygon: Disney}} Senior producer Jim Boone recalled reviewers that asked whether the company could be \"more over-the-top\" than ''Saints Row: The Third'', which they took as a challenge.{{r|Polygon: Volition}} The team focused more on making the game \"fun\" than \"for the sake of being over the top\", and felt that superpowers helped the game's basic navigation and combat.{{r|Polygon: Volition}} They also chose to remove the previous game's in-game mobile phone-based navigation, which hindered its narration, and replaced it with a \"quest log structure\".{{r|Polygon: Volition}} The team chose not to devote as much time improving the game's graphics, considering the impending release of next generation platforms. The game spent less time in development than prior series games.{{r|Polygon: Volition}}\n\nIn August 2014, Volition announced that they would be releasing a [[development kit]] for the Windows version of the game, which lets players [[video game mod|modify]] game assets{{r|Polygon: modders}} and create new weapons.{{r|Polygon: port}}\n\nThe in-game radio has seven pre-programmed radio stations and 109 licensed tracks. The game's original soundtrack is composed by Malcolm Kirby Jr.,{{r|Polygon: soundtrack}} who also composed the previous game's soundtrack.{{r|GamersHell: Sumthing Else}}\n\nOn November 2016, the PC version included [[Steam Workshop]], allowing players to release [http://steamcommunity.com/app/206420/workshop/ a wide number of mods] such as characters and weapons included in the game.\n\n=== Release and downloadable content ===\n\n{{see also|Enter the Dominatrix|Saints Row: Gat Out of Hell}}\n\n''Saints Row IV'' was released for [[Microsoft Windows]], [[PlayStation 3]], and [[Xbox 360]] in North America on August 20, 2013, and worldwide on three days later.{{r|Polygon: Game of the Gen}} Preorders included a patriot-themed downloadable content pack that included flamethrower, dubstep, and rocket launcher weapons, a bald eagle jet, and an [[Uncle Sam]] outfit.{{r|Polygon: Commander in Chief}} A [[limited edition]] release of the game included a replica of the game's dubstep gun, a [[big red button|doomsday button]], and Johnny Gat statuette.{{r|Polygon: Wub Wub}} Another limited edition release, the Game of the Generation Edition, included the previous items as well as a display case for the game.{{r|Polygon: Game of the Gen}} The game was originally [[refused classification|refused ratings classification]] and effectively banned [[Australian Classification Board|in Australia]],{{r|IGN: banned}} The country's PlayStation 4 release was later recalled due to a classification error.{{r|Kotaku: RE recall}}\n\nThe game received multiple downloadable content packs. A Season Pass, which features two new mission packs and the aforementioned anal probe weapon, was announced prior to the game's release.{{cn|date=February 2020}} A \"GAT V\" DLC appeared on 17 September 2013, the release day for rival open world game ''[[Grand Theft Auto V]]'' (GTA V).<ref name=\"gaston20130917\">{{Cite web |url=https://www.gamespot.com/articles/saints-row-iv-gat-v-dlc-released-for-free-on-pc-today/1100-6414516/ |title=Saints Row IV GAT V DLC released for free on PC today |last=Gaston |first=Martin |date=2013-09-17 |website=GameSpot |language=en-US |access-date=2020-02-18}}</ref> The first mission pack, ''Enter the Dominatrix'',{{r|Polygon: season pass}} was released October 22, 2013.{{r|EGM EtD review}} The pack was originally intended as [[Saints Row: The Third downloadable content|a mission pack for ''Saints Row: The Third'']] but evolved into the full sequel, ''Saints Row IV''. The leftover content became the sequel's first mission pack.{{r|EGM: SR4EtD|Kotaku: Resurrected}} It tells an alternative story about the Zin invasion wherein the Steelport simulation is hijacked by a rogue [[artificial intelligence]] called the Dominatrix. The pack's storytelling frequently breaks the [[fourth wall]] and self-referentially acknowledges its own plot holes and incongruence with the larger ''Saints Row'' story.{{r|Eurogamer: EtD review}} Some scenes end in [[concept art]] or videos of Volition employees acting out the drama so as to give the game an unfinished feel. The pack also casts characters from ''Saints Row: The Third'' who did not return in the sequel.{{r|Eurogamer: EtD review}} There are five missions in total,{{r|OXM EtD review}} new weapons, vehicles, and [[Artificial intelligence (video games)|computer-controlled]] support characters (\"homies\").{{r|Eurogamer: EtD review}} The second and final mission pack, ''How the Saints Save Christmas'', features new weapons and vehicles and a plot to save [[Santa Claus]] from the Steelport simulation. It was released in December 2013.{{r|Engadget: Christmas}} Non-mission downloadable content packs include new costumes, vehicles, and weapons, e.g., face masks of United States Presidents [[George Washington]], [[Abraham Lincoln]], [[George W. Bush]], and [[Barack Obama]].{{r|Polygon: 1 mil}}\n\n''Saints Row IV'' was released in several summative editions.{{r|Polygon: National Treasure}} The Game of the Century edition included 20 downloadable content sets and was released May 9, 2014.{{r|Polygon: Century}} The National Treasure Edition included 29 downloadable content sets and was released on July 8, 2014.{{r|Polygon: National Treasure}} High Voltage Software [[Porting of video games|ported]] the game to [[PlayStation 4]] and [[Xbox One]] with all of its downloadable content as ''Saints Row IV: Re-Elected''. It was announced in late August 2014 alongside ''[[Saints Row: Gat Out of Hell]]'', a standalone ''Saints Row IV'' expansion developed by Volition in conjunction with High Voltage.{{r|Polygon: port}} Both were released in North America on January 20, 2015, and worldwide three days later,{{r|IGN: Gat new dates}} both separately and bundled together. The release included new features such as [[voice command]]s.{{r|Polygon: port}} A Linux port was presented in December 2015.

Riendeau wrote that Volition \"trimmed the fat\" from previous games, and that their addition of superpowers \"blew the constraints off a genre already known for player freedom\".{{r|Polygon: review}} She considered the story funny and \"as obvious as can be\", but found its characters \"well-realized\".{{r|Polygon: review}} Riendeau particularly praised the game's \"treatment of gender\"{{emdash}}bold female characters who could pursue same-sex relationships or even switch their gender mid-game, and were not treated differently for being female{{emdash}}but found the game's continued association between women and sex workers \"problematic\" and a \"vestige from the series' roots as a juvenile crime drama\".{{r|Polygon: review}}\n\nReflecting on the series' progression, ''[[Eurogamer]]''{{'s}} Chris Schilling said that ''Saints Row IV'' successfully reinvented the series yet again, with superpowers replacing the usefulness of in-game vehicles. He compared the game's exploration mechanics to that of ''[[Crackdown (video game)|Crackdown]]'', and its superpowers to the ''[[Infamous (series)|Infamous]]'' and ''[[Prototype (series)|Prototype]]'' series, and added that the game's silliness fulfilled a specific niche in gaming. Schilling wrote that the need to restock at ammo shops was a \"jarring holdover\" from the previous games, but appreciated the recurrence of elements such as the GPS navigation system, side mission gameplay, and city district liberation.{{r|Eurogamer: review}} He regarded the game overall as artful but \"gloriously dumb\", like \"the [[Sistine Chapel ceiling]] of stupidity\".{{r|Eurogamer: review}} Schilling also commented on how he felt an urge to simply forgo the story to search for collectibles, though despite these options, the game became \"wearying\" over long play sessions.{{r|Eurogamer: review}}\n\nSimilarly, Dan Stapleton of [[IGN]] became bored when his superhero protagonist had little \"to overcome\", and ultimately likened the game to \"enabling [[invulnerability|god-like]] [[cheat code]]s\" in its predecessor.{{r|IGN: review}} He wrote that it was very difficult to die, given the large amount of [[power-ups]] dropped by enemies, and that the otherwise praiseworthy features from ''Saints Row: The Third'' felt \"vestigial\" when outmoded by superpowers.{{r|IGN: review}} Stapleton said the player received the powers too early, which let the player play without caring about the city, and thus removed the \"sense of place and character it had in the previous game\".{{r|IGN: review}} He considered the game's large number of collectibles an acknowledgement of this hole, which while originally rewarding, quickly becomes a \"chore\".{{r|IGN: review}} Stapleton praised the ''Red Faction''-style Disintegrator and Abductor guns, though considered the dubstep gun an \"ineffective disappointment\".{{r|IGN: review}} As a symbol, though, ''Polygon'' described the dubstep gun as \"iconic\" of ''Saints Row IV''.{{r|Polygon: replica}}\n\n== Sequel ==\nIn August 2019, it was announced that Volition was \"deep in development\" of a new ''Saints Row'' game.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://mb.cision.com/Main/15049/2880582/1089677.pdf |title=THQ Nordic AB (publ) Reg No.: 556582-6558 Interim Report 1 \u2022 1 April \u2013 30 June 2019 |date=14 August 2019 |website=[[Cision]]}}</ref>\n\n== Notes ==\n\n{{notelist}}\n\n== References ==\n\n{{Reflist|refs=\n\n<ref name=\"EGM EtD review\">{{cite web |url=http://www.egmnow.com/articles/reviews/egm-review-saints-row-iv-enter-the-dominatrix/ |access-date=June 14, 2014 |work=[[Electronic Gaming Monthly]] |title=EGM Review: Saints Row IV: Enter the Dominatrix |last1=Patterson |first1=Eric L. |date=November 1, 2013 |archive-url=https://www.webcitation.org/6QKeIyYax?url=http://www.egmnow.com/articles/reviews/egm-review-saints-row-iv-enter-the-dominatrix/ |archive-date=June 14, 2014 |url-status=live |df=mdy-all }}</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"EGM: SR4EtD\">{{cite web |url=http://www.egmnow.com/articles/reviews/egm-review-saints-row-iv-enter-the-dominatrix/ |access-date=May 18, 2014 |title=EGM Review: Saints Row IV: Enter the Dominatrix |last1=Patterson |first1=Eric L. |date=November 1, 2013 |work=[[Electronic Gaming Monthly]] |archive-url=https://www.webcitation.org/6PegRmMVU?url=http://www.egmnow.com/articles/reviews/egm-review-saints-row-iv-enter-the-dominatrix/ |archive-date=May 18, 2014 |url-status=live |df=mdy-all }}</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"Engadget: Christmas\">{{cite web |url=https://www.engadget.com/2013/12/11/psa-saints-row-4-how-the-saints-save-christmas-dlc-out-now/ |access-date=March 30, 2015 |title=PSA: Saints Row 4 'How the Saints Save Christmas' DLC out now |last1=Hinkle |first1=David |date=December 11, 2013 |work=[[Engadget]] |archive-url=https://www.webcitation.org/6XQPxD3qI?url=http://www.engadget.com/2013/12/11/psa-saints-row-4-how-the-saints-save-christmas-dlc-out-now/ |archive-date=March 30, 2015 |url-status=live |df=mdy-all }}</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"Eurogamer: EtD review\">{{cite web |url=http://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2013-10-22-saints-row-4-enter-the-dominatrix-review |access-date=June 14, 2014 |title=Saints Row 4: Enter The Dominatrix review |last1=Schilling |first1=Chris |date=October 22, 2013 |work=[[Eurogamer]] |archive-url=https://www.webcitation.org/6QKeBxDQr?url=http://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2013-10-22-saints-row-4-enter-the-dominatrix-review |archive-date=June 14, 2014 |url-status=live |df=mdy-all }}</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"Eurogamer: review\">{{cite web |url=http://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2013-08-14-saints-row-4-review |access-date=March 15, 2015 |work=[[Eurogamer]] |title=Saints Row 4 review |last1=Schilling |first1=Chris |date=August 14, 2013 |archive-url=https://www.webcitation.org/6X30MocZJ?url=http://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2013-08-14-saints-row-4-review |archive-date=March 15, 2015 |url-status=live |df=mdy-all }}</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"GamersHell: Sumthing Else\">{{cite press release |url=http://www.gamershell.com/companies/sumthing_else_music_works/928868.html |access-date=May 17, 2014 |title=Sumthing Else Music Works Releases Saints Row: The Third -

It is the fourth title in the ''[[Saints Row]]'' series. In the game, the [[playable character]] is the leader of the 3rd Street Saints, a [[street gang]] that has become the world's most powerful and popular organization, and must fend off an alien invasion after becoming [[President of the United States]] and receiving [[Superpower (ability)|superpower]]s. The player is free to explore their environment while completing main and side [[Level (video gaming)|missions]] at their leisure. The game incorporates elements from science fiction video games and films, and continues the series' reputation for over-the-top [[parody]]. It was released in August 2013 for [[Microsoft Windows]], [[PlayStation 3]], and [[Xbox 360]], and was later [[Porting of video games|ported]] to [[PlayStation 4]], [[Xbox One]], and [[Linux]] in 2015. A [[Nintendo Switch]] port was released on March 27, 2020.\n\nThe game was Volition's first after its sale to [[Koch Media]] in early 2013. The supernatural and superpower concept for the game started in ''[[Enter the Dominatrix]]'', a cancelled [[expansion pack|expansion]] planned for ''[[Saints Row: The Third]]'', which the team expanded into ''Saints Row IV''. Volition later released a \"director's cut\" of ''Enter the Dominatrix'' as [[downloadable content]] for ''Saints Row IV'' alongside ''How the Saints Saved Christmas'', other weapons, costumes, and vehicle packs, and a standalone expansion, ''[[Saints Row: Gat out of Hell]]'' (which serves as the epilogue to the story). ''Saints Row IV'' received several limited and summative edition releases, and was briefly banned in Australia. Critics praised ''Saints Row IV''{{'s}} humor and character customization options, but criticized its lack of challenge. It sold over one million copies in its first week.\n\n== Gameplay ==\n\nSimilar to previous ''[[Saints Row]]'' series games,{{r|IGN: review}} ''Saints Row IV'' is an [[open world]] [[action game]] with [[third-person shooter]] elements wherein the player is free to explore the environment and, at their leisure, play story or side [[Level (video gaming)|missions]].{{r|Polygon: review}} As the leader of the Saints, a [[street gang]] that has become the world's most \"powerful and popular\" organization, the player is elected [[President of the United States]], receives [[Superpower (ability)|superpowers]], and fends off an [[alien invasion]].{{r|Polygon: review}} Most often the player will engage in shooting and racing activities, though other activities vary from fighting crowds of zombies, shoot-outs in tanks,{{r|Polygon: review}} [[side-scrolling]] [[brawlers]], fights against supersized, [[daikaiju]] [[energy drink]] cans, and using a [[dubstep]] gun to interrupt 1950s [[Americana]].{{r|Eurogamer: review}} The player-character receives elemental powers and superpowers that greatly increase their jump height and running speed, such that the player can hop over buildings and outrun vehicles.{{r|Polygon: review}} The elemental powers include abilities to shoot fire and ice projectiles, [[telekinetic]]ally toss things, and create shockwaves upon landing jumps.{{r|Eurogamer: review}}  As the player progresses through the game, they can optionally upgrade their abilities and weapons [[skill tree]]{{r|Polygon: review}} by using collectible \"data clusters\" scattered around town.{{r|Eurogamer: review}} If the player becomes too rowdy, the alien race's police analogue will intervene.{{r|Eurogamer: review}} As in previous games, the player-character's look and feel is entirely customizable via a robust character editor feature.{{r|IGN: review}}\n\nThe game is set in a nearly identical{{r|IGN: review}} simulation of Steelport, the fictional city setting from ''[[Saints Row: The Third]]'',{{r|Eurogamer: review}} though individual story missions have new, custom-designed [[Level (video gaming)|levels]].{{r|IGN: review}} ''Saints Row IV''{{'s}} story parodies science fiction video games, especially ''[[Mass Effect 2]]'', as well as films like ''[[The Matrix]]'' and ''[[Zero Dark Thirty]]'', and other \"nerd culture\".{{r|Polygon: review}} Some story missions are propelled by individual characters' existential crises,{{r|Polygon: review}} as each Saint character is stuck in a personal simulation of their own hell, and must be rescued by the player.{{r|Eurogamer: review}} Other elements borrowed from video game culture include [[BioWare]]-style character romances games and a ''[[Metal Gear]]''-style mission with an unhelpful partner.{{r|Eurogamer: review}}\n\nCity districts are \"liberated\" from alien occupation as the player completes side missions in occupied districts.{{r|Eurogamer: review}} Liberated districts increase the player's hourly income, which can be spent on weapons, skills, and perks. Side missions include Insurance Fraud (where the player jumps into traffic to collect insurance money),{{r|Eurogamer: review}} [[demolition derby]]-style Mayhem, and superpowered foot races. ''Saints Row IV'' has a two-player [[Cooperative gameplay|cooperative]] mode.{{r|IGN: review}}\n\n== Plot ==\nA few months after the events of ''[[Saints Row: The Third]]'', the 3rd Street Saints are called to assist [[Secret Intelligence Service|MI-6]] agent Asha Odekar and former Deckers leader Matt Miller in foiling a plot by former STAG leader Cyrus Temple. The Boss and their top lieutenants, Shaundi and Pierce Washington, breach Cyrus' base with Asha, killing him, and preventing a nuclear missile hitting [[Washington, D.C.|Washington D.C.]], earning the adoration of America. Five years later, the Boss becomes elected [[President of the United States]], receiving [[Keith David]] as his adviser, while assigning his cabinet roles to various Saints members and former Vice Kings leader Benjamin King. Moments into a press conference, [[Earth]] is hit by an [[alien invasion|invasion]] from the Zin, led by the warlord Zinyak, who destroy the [[White House]] and abduct the Boss, Keith, and most of the cabinet.\n\nAfter the Boss escapes from a computer simulation based on a 1950s [[sitcom]] environment, aided by hacker specialist Kinzie Kensington, they find themselves brought into a virtual recreation of Steelport. Working to manipulate the environment with special powers, they eventually reunite with Kenzie and Keith within a stolen Zin ship. When the group try to contact other Saints for help, Zinyak prevents this by destroying the Earth. Enraged, the Boss re-enters the Steelport simulation to find the others that the Zin abducted, rescuing each from simulations based on their personal nightmares. Zinyak responds by having the Steelport simulation flooded with copies of gang members the Boss faced in the past, which causes Kinzie to suspect he is drawing these from the memories of someone else. The Boss quickly deduces that the Zin must have abducted Johnny Gat, a lieutenant of the Saints who was presumed dead, and rescues him from his own simulation.\n\nThe Saints soon rally inside the simulation to confront Zinyak, only for Kinzie to be captured in the real world by Zin forces. Discovering that Keith betrayed them, the Boss confronts him and learns he did so in exchange for the Zin restoring the Earth. After pursuing him through his own personal nightmare, the Boss reveals to Keith he was tricked, and convinces him to rejoin the Saints. Learning where Kinzie was taken, the Boss rescues her from her personal nightmare. With the group back in operations, Kinzie discovers a plan to board Zinyak's ship by overloading the Steelport simulation to create an opening. Upon the Saints achieving this, the Boss boards Zinyak's ship, steals [[power armor]] that emulates their powers from the simulation, and uses it to kill Zinyak in front of the Zin, taking control of their empire.\n\nThe game's loyalty missions impact the ending of the story: if a number of these are not completed, the Boss makes plans for the Saints to take over more planets and expand their new empire; however, if all are completed, the Saints learn that they can restore Earth using [[time-travel]], discovering that Zinyak captured several historical figures and placed them in [[suspended animation]]. The Boss soon discovers one of them to be 19th century writer [[Jane Austen]], whom they are a fan of, and who reveals herself as the narrator of the game's story once she is awaken her from stasis.\n\n== Development ==\nAfter the release of ''Saints Row: The Third'', preliminary work on a game called ''Saints Row: Part Four'' began. The game would take place after the events of ''The Third'' in a new city and feature gameplay similar to ''The Third''.<ref>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bXKeOTo9AH0</ref> Meanwhile, a [[standalone expansion]] to ''The Third'' called ''Enter the Dominatrix'' was first announced as a 2012 [[April Fool's]] joke,{{r|Ginf: April Fool's}} but still went into development. The [[expansion pack]]'s basic concept included a superpowered player-character trapped by alien commander Zinyak in a simulation of Steelport.{{r|Polygon: Dominatrix}} With [[THQ]] suffering financially, its president Jason Rubin encouraged company subsidiary and ''Saints Row'' series developer [[Volition (company)|Volition]] to grow elements from the expansion into a full game.{{r|Polygon: Volition}} The company announced this change in direction in June 2012,{{r|Polygon: merging}} cancelling ''Saints Row: Part Four'' and expanding ''Enter the Dominatrix'' into a full sequel, ''Saints Row IV''.{{r|Polygon: Volition}} The company's strategy was partly to avoid sales issues by releasing the game in August 2013, prior to the circulation of rumors about [[History of video game consoles (eighth generation)|next generation]] video game consoles.{{r|Polygon: Volition}} Volition was sold to [[Koch Media]] in early 2013 when its parent company, THQ, filed for bankruptcy. It became Koch's first internal video game studio. The studio officially announced ''Saints Row IV'' two months later, which was published by Koch Media brand [[Deep Silver]]. Acquired without rights to their ''[[Red Faction]]'' series, Volition's new goals were to make connected, open world games where \"the player is an agent of mayhem\". The entire company worked on the one game.{{r|Polygon: Volition}}\n\nEach of the ''Saints Row'' series games had a core intent, and while the first three games built on the first's \"outlandishness and irreverence\", the fourth focused on \"the [[supernatural]] and superpowers\".{{r|Polygon: Disney}} Senior producer Jim Boone recalled reviewers that asked whether the company could be \"more over-the-top\" than ''Saints Row: The Third'', which they took as a challenge.{{r|Polygon: Volition}} The team focused more on making the game \"fun\" than \"for the sake of being over the top\", and felt that superpowers helped the game's basic navigation and combat.{{r|Polygon: Volition}} They also chose to remove the previous game's in-game mobile phone-based navigation, which hindered its narration, and replaced it with a \"quest log structure\".{{r|Polygon: Volition}} The team chose not to devote as much time improving the game's graphics, considering the impending release of next generation platforms. The game spent less time in development than prior series games.{{r|Polygon: Volition}}\n\nIn August 2014, Volition announced that they would be releasing a [[development kit]] for the Windows version of the game, which lets players [[video game mod|modify]] game assets{{r|Polygon: modders}} and create new weapons.{{r|Polygon: port}}\n\nThe in-game radio has seven pre-programmed radio stations and 109 licensed tracks. The game's original soundtrack is composed by Malcolm Kirby Jr.,{{r|Polygon: soundtrack}} who also composed the previous game's soundtrack.{{r|GamersHell: Sumthing Else}}\n\nOn November 2016, the PC version included [[Steam Workshop]], allowing players to release [http://steamcommunity.com/app/206420/workshop/ a wide number of mods] such as characters and weapons included in the game.\n\n=== Release and downloadable content ===\n\n{{see also|Enter the Dominatrix|Saints Row: Gat Out of Hell}}\n\n''Saints Row IV'' was released for [[Microsoft Windows]], [[PlayStation 3]], and [[Xbox 360]] in North America on August 20, 2013, and worldwide on three days later.{{r|Polygon: Game of the Gen}} Preorders included a patriot-themed downloadable content pack that included flamethrower, dubstep, and rocket launcher weapons, a bald eagle jet, and an [[Uncle Sam]] outfit.{{r|Polygon: Commander in Chief}} A [[limited edition]] release of the game included a replica of the game's dubstep gun, a [[big red button|doomsday button]], and Johnny Gat statuette.{{r|Polygon: Wub Wub}} Another limited edition release, the Game of the Generation Edition, included the previous items as well as a display case for the game.{{r|Polygon: Game of the Gen}} The game was originally [[refused classification|refused ratings classification]] and effectively banned [[Australian Classification Board|in Australia]],{{r|IGN: banned}} but was later accepted when modified to remove an optional mission{{r|IGN: recall}} that involved an [[anal probe]] weapon and incentivized drug use.{{r|IGN: refused}} The country's PlayStation 4 release was later recalled due to a classification error.{{r|Kotaku: RE recall}}\n\nThe game received multiple downloadable content packs. A Season Pass, which features two new mission packs and the aforementioned anal probe weapon, was announced prior to the game's release.{{cn|date=February 2020}} A \"GAT V\" DLC appeared on 17 September 2013, the release day for rival open world game ''[[Grand Theft Auto V]]'' (GTA V).<ref name=\"gaston20130917\">{{Cite web |url=https://www.gamespot.com/articles/saints-row-iv-gat-v-dlc-released-for-free-on-pc-today/1100-6414516/ |title=Saints Row IV GAT V DLC released for free on PC today |last=Gaston |first=Martin |date=2013-09-17 |website=GameSpot |language=en-US |access-date=2020-02-18}}</ref> The first mission pack, ''Enter the Dominatrix'',{{r|Polygon: season pass}} was released October 22, 2013.{{r|EGM EtD review}} The pack was originally intended as [[Saints Row: The Third downloadable content|a mission pack for ''Saints Row: The Third'']] but evolved into the full sequel, ''Saints Row IV''. The leftover content became the sequel's first mission pack.{{r|EGM: SR4EtD|Kotaku: Resurrected}} It tells an alternative story about the Zin invasion wherein the Steelport simulation is hijacked by a rogue [[artificial intelligence]] called the Dominatrix. The pack's storytelling frequently breaks the [[fourth wall]] and self-referentially acknowledges its own plot holes and incongruence with the larger ''Saints Row'' story.{{r|Eurogamer: EtD review}} Some scenes end in [[concept art]] or videos of Volition employees acting out the drama so as to give the game an unfinished feel. The pack also casts characters from ''Saints Row: The Third'' who did not return in the sequel.{{r|Eurogamer: EtD review}} There are five missions in total,{{r|OXM EtD review}} new weapons, vehicles, and [[Artificial intelligence (video games)|computer-controlled]] support characters (\"homies\").{{r|Eurogamer: EtD review}} The second and final mission pack, ''How the Saints Save Christmas'', features new weapons and vehicles and a plot to save [[Santa Claus]] from the Steelport simulation. It was released in December 2013.{{r|Engadget: Christmas}} Non-mission downloadable content packs include new costumes, vehicles, and weapons, e.g., face masks of United States Presidents [[George Washington]], [[Abraham Lincoln]], [[George W. Bush]], and [[Barack Obama]].{{r|Polygon: 1 mil}}\n\n''Saints Row IV'' was released in several summative editions.{{r|Polygon: National Treasure}} The Game of the Century edition included 20 downloadable content sets and was released May 9, 2014.{{r|Polygon: Century}} The National Treasure Edition included 29 downloadable content sets and was released on July 8, 2014.{{r|Polygon: National Treasure}} High Voltage Software [[Porting of video games|ported]] the game to [[PlayStation 4]] and [[Xbox One]] with all of its downloadable content as ''Saints Row IV: Re-Elected''. It was announced in late August 2014 alongside ''[[Saints Row: Gat Out of Hell]]'', a standalone ''Saints Row IV'' expansion developed by Volition in conjunction with High Voltage.{{r|Polygon: port}} Both were released in North America on January 20, 2015, and worldwide three days later,{{r|IGN: Gat new dates}} both separately and bundled together. The release included new features such as [[voice command]]s.{{r|Polygon: port}} A Linux port was presented in December 2015. ''Re-Elected'' was released for the [[Nintendo Switch]] on March 27, 2020.<ref>{{cite web | url = https://www.vg247.com/2020/02/04/saints-row-4-re-elected-coming-to-switch-march-27/ | title = Saints Row 4: Re-Elected coming to Switch March 27 | first = Stephany | last = Nunneley | date = February 4, 2020 | accessdate = February 4, 2020 | work = [[VG247]] }}</ref>\n\n== Reception ==\n{{Video game reviews\n| MC = (PC) 86/100<ref name=\"MC-PC\">{{cite web|url=http://www.metacritic.com/game/pc/saints-row-iv|title=Saints Row IV for PC Reviews|work=[[Metacritic]]|publisher=[[CBS Interactive]]|accessdate=August 14, 2013}}</ref><br />(X360) 81/100<ref name=\"MC-X360\">{{cite web|url=http://www.metacritic.com/game/xbox-360/saints-row-iv|title=Saints Row IV for Xbox 360 Reviews|work=[[Metacritic]]|publisher=[[CBS Interactive]]|accessdate=August 14, 2013}}</ref><br />(PS3) 76/100<ref name=\"MC-PS3\">{{cite web|url=http://www.metacritic.com/game/playstation-3/saints-row-iv|title=Saints Row IV for PlayStation 3 Reviews|work=[[Metacritic]]|accessdate=August 14, 2013}}</ref><br/>(PS4) 75/100<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.metacritic.com/game/playstation-4/saints-row-iv-re-elected|title=Saints Row IV: Re-Elected|work=Metacritic}}</ref><br/>(XONE) 73/100<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.metacritic.com/game/xbox-one/saints-row-iv-re-elected|title=Saints Row IV: Re-Elected|work=Metacritic}}</ref>\n| EuroG = 8/10{{r|Eurogamer: review}}\n| IGN = 7.3/10{{r|IGN: review}}\n| Poly = 9/10{{r|Polygon: review}}\n}}\n\nThe game received generally positive reviews, according to video game [[review aggregator]] [[Metacritic]].{{r|MC-PC|MC-X360|MC-PS3}} Reviewers praised its over-the-top humor and character customization options,{{r|IGN: review|Polygon: review}} and criticized its lack of challenge.{{r|IGN: review|Eurogamer: review}} Several also commented on its \"even-handed treatment\" of gender, particularly female characters,{{r|Polygon: review|Eurogamer: review}} and spotlighted hacker and former FBI agent Kinzie Kensington's character performance.{{r|IGN: review|Eurogamer: review}} ''Saints Row IV'' sold over one million copies in its first week,{{r|Polygon: 1 mil}} and as of 2013, Volition has not released total sales figures.{{r|GameZone: strong}}\n\n''[[Polygon (website)|Polygon]]''{{'s}} Danielle Riendeau described ''Saints Row IV'' as \"big, goofy, and self-referential fun\" and thought that the game accomplished what it set out to be: \"an outrageous exercise in player power fantasy\".{{r|Polygon: review}} She also praised the game's degree of freedom around character identity, its \"dumb and lovable\" narrative, and its transitions between varied sequences. Riendeau wrote that Volition \"trimmed the fat\" from previous games, and that their addition of superpowers \"blew the constraints off a genre already known for player freedom\".{{r|Polygon: review}} She considered the story funny and \"as obvious as can be\", but found its characters \"well-realized\".{{r|Polygon: review}} Riendeau particularly praised the game's \"treatment of gender\"{{emdash}}bold female characters who could pursue same-sex relationships or even switch their gender mid-game, and were not treated differently for being female{{emdash}}but found the game's continued association between women and sex workers \"problematic\" and a \"vestige from the series' roots as a juvenile crime drama\".{{r|Polygon: review}}\n\nReflecting on the series' progression, ''[[Eurogamer]]''{{'s}} Chris Schilling said that ''Saints Row IV'' successfully reinvented the series yet again, with superpowers replacing the usefulness of in-game vehicles. He compared the game's exploration mechanics to that of ''[[Crackdown (video game)|Crackdown]]'', and its superpowers to the ''[[Infamous (series)|Infamous]]'' and ''[[Prototype (series)|Prototype]]'' series, and added that the game's silliness fulfilled a specific niche in gaming. Schilling wrote that the need to restock at ammo shops was a \"jarring holdover\" from the previous games, but appreciated the recurrence of elements such as the GPS navigation system, side mission gameplay, and city district liberation.{{r|Eurogamer: review}} He regarded the game overall as artful but \"gloriously dumb\", like \"the [[Sistine Chapel ceiling]] of stupidity\".{{r|Eurogamer: review}} Schilling also commented on how he felt an urge to simply forgo the story to search for collectibles, though despite these options, the game became \"wearying\" over long play sessions.{{r|Eurogamer: review}}\n\nSimilarly, Dan Stapleton of [[IGN]] became bored when his superhero protagonist had little \"to overcome\", and ultimately likened the game to \"enabling [[invulnerability|god-like]] [[cheat code]]s\" in its predecessor.{{r|IGN: review}} He wrote that it was very difficult to die, given the large amount of [[power-ups]] dropped by enemies, and that the otherwise praiseworthy features from ''Saints Row: The Third'' felt \"vestigial\" when outmoded by superpowers.{{r|IGN: review}} Stapleton said the player received the powers too early, which let the player play without caring about the city, and thus removed the \"sense of place and character it had in the previous game\".{{r|IGN: review}} He considered the game's large number of collectibles an acknowledgement of this hole, which while originally rewarding, quickly becomes a \"chore\".{{r|IGN: review}} Stapleton praised the ''Red Faction''-style Disintegrator and Abductor guns, though considered the dubstep gun an \"ineffective disappointment\".{{r|IGN: review}} As a symbol, though, ''Polygon'' described the dubstep gun as \"iconic\" of ''Saints Row IV''.{{r|Polygon: replica}}\n\n== Sequel ==\nIn August 2019, it was announced that Volition was \"deep in development\" of a new ''Saints Row'' game.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://mb.cision.com/Main/15049/2880582/1089677.pdf |title=THQ Nordic AB (publ) Reg No.: 556582-6558 Interim Report 1 \u2022 1 April \u2013 30 June 2019 |date=14 August 2019 |website=[[Cision]]}}</ref>\n\n== Notes ==\n\n{{notelist}}\n\n== References ==\n\n{{Reflist|refs=\n\n<ref name=\"EGM EtD review\">{{cite web |url=http://www.egmnow.com/articles/reviews/egm-review-saints-row-iv-enter-the-dominatrix/ |access-date=June 14, 2014 |work=[[Electronic Gaming Monthly]] |title=EGM Review: Saints Row IV: Enter the Dominatrix |last1=Patterson |first1=Eric L. |date=November 1, 2013 |archive-url=https://www.webcitation.org/6QKeIyYax?url=http://www.egmnow.com/articles/reviews/egm-review-saints-row-iv-enter-the-dominatrix/ |archive-date=June 14, 2014 |url-status=live |df=mdy-all }}</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"EGM: SR4EtD\">{{cite web |url=http://www.egmnow.com/articles/reviews/egm-review-saints-row-iv-enter-the-dominatrix/ |access-date=May 18, 2014 |title=EGM Review: Saints Row IV: Enter the Dominatrix |last1=Patterson |first1=Eric L. |date=November 1, 2013 |work=[[Electronic Gaming Monthly]] |archive-url=https://www.webcitation.org/6PegRmMVU?url=http://www.egmnow.com/articles/reviews/egm-review-saints-row-iv-enter-the-dominatrix/ |archive-date=May 18, 2014 |url-status=live |df=mdy-all }}</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"Engadget: Christmas\">{{cite web |url=https://www.engadget.com/2013/12/11/psa-saints-row-4-how-the-saints-save-christmas-dlc-out-now/ |access-date=March 30, 2015 |title=PSA: Saints Row 4 'How the Saints Save Christmas' DLC out now |last1=Hinkle |first1=David |date=December 11, 2013 |work=[[Engadget]] |archive-url=https://www.webcitation.org/6XQPxD3qI?url=http://www.engadget.com/2013/12/11/psa-saints-row-4-how-the-saints-save-christmas-dlc-out-now/ |archive-date=March 30, 2015 |url-status=live |df=mdy-all }}</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"Eurogamer: EtD review\">{{cite web |url=http://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2013-10-22-saints-row-4-enter-the-dominatrix-review |access-date=June 14, 2014 |title=Saints Row 4: Enter The Dominatrix review |last1=Schilling |first1=Chris |date=October 22, 2013 |work=[[Eurogamer]] |archive-url=https://www.webcitation.org/6QKeBxDQr?url=http://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2013-10-22-saints-row-4-enter-the-dominatrix-review |archive-date=June 14, 2014 |url-status=live |df=mdy-all }}</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"Eurogamer: review\">{{cite web |url=http://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2013-08-14-saints-row-4-review |access-date=March 15, 2015 |work=[[Eurogamer]] |title=Saints Row 4 review |last1=Schilling |first1=Chris |date=August 14, 2013 |archive-url=https://www.webcitation.org/6X30MocZJ?url=http://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2013-08-14-saints-row-4-review |archive-date=March 15, 2015 |url-status=live |df=mdy-all }}</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"GamersHell: Sumthing Else\">{{cite press release |url=http://www.gamershell.com/companies/sumthing_else_music_works/928868.html |access-date=May 17, 2014 |title=Sumthing Else Music Works Releases Saints Row: The Third -

The musical follows the story of Dolly Gallagher Levi, a strong-willed matchmaker, as she travels to Yonkers, New York to find a match for the miserly \"well-known unmarried half-a-millionaire\" Horace Vandergelder.\n\n''Hello, Dolly!'' first debuted at the [[Fisher Building|Fisher Theater]] in Detroit on November 18, 1963<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.broadwayworld.com/shows/backstage.php?showid=5050|title=Hello, Dolly! - 1964 Broadway - Backstage & Production Info|website=www.broadwayworld.com|access-date=2019-11-23}}</ref>, directed and choreographed by [[Gower Champion]] and produced by [[David Merrick]], and moved to Broadway in 1964, winning 10 Tony Awards, including Best Musical. This set a record which the play held for 37 years. The show album ''Hello, Dolly!

''Top Pop Albums'' (2010), Record Research, {{ISBN|0-89820-183-7}}, p.973</ref> [[Louis Armstrong]] also was featured in the film version of the show, performing a small part of the song \"Hello, Dolly!\".\n\nThe show has become one of the most enduring musical theater hits, with four Broadway revivals and international success. It was also made into the 1969 film ''[[Hello, Dolly! (film)|Hello Dolly!]]'' by [[20th Century Fox]], which won three Academy Awards, including [[Academy Award for Best Original Score|Best Score of a Musical Picture]] and was nominated in four other categories, including [[Academy Award for Best Picture|Best Picture]] at the [[42nd Academy Awards]].\n\n==History==\nThe plot of ''Hello, Dolly!'' originated in the 1835 English play ''A Day Well Spent'' by [[John Oxenford]], which [[Johann Nestroy]] adapted into the farce ''[[Einen Jux will er sich machen]]'' (''He Will Go on a Spree'' or ''He'll Have Himself a Good Time''). [[Thornton Wilder]] adapted Nestroy's play into his 1938 farcical play ''The Merchant of Yonkers''. That play was a flop, so he revised it and retitled it as ''[[The Matchmaker]]'' in 1955, expanding the role of Dolly (played by [[Ruth Gordon]]).<ref name=London2008>[http://www.indielondon.co.uk/Theatre-Review/hello-dolly-new-wimbledon-theatre-review \"Hello Dolly! \u2013 New Wimbledon Theatre\"] IndieLondon, March 2008</ref>  ''The Matchmaker'' became a hit and was much revived and made into [[The Matchmaker (1958 film)|a 1958 film]] starring [[Shirley Booth]]. However, the 1891 musical ''[[A Trip to Chinatown]]'' also features a meddlesome widow who strives to bring romance to several couples and to herself in a big city restaurant.<ref>Saltzman, Simon.

Dolly makes a living through what she calls \"meddling\" \u2013 matchmaking and numerous sidelines, including dance instruction and [[mandolin]] lessons (\"I Put My Hand In\").  She is currently seeking a wife for grumpy Horace Vandergelder, the well-known half-a-millionaire, but it becomes clear that Dolly intends to marry Horace herself.  Ambrose Kemper, a young artist, wants to marry Horace's weepy niece Ermengarde, but Horace opposes this because Ambrose's vocation does not guarantee a steady living.  Ambrose enlists Dolly's help, and they travel to [[Yonkers, New York]] to visit Horace, who is a prominent citizen there and owns Vandergelder's Hay and Feed.\n\nHorace explains to his two clerks, Cornelius Hackl and Barnaby Tucker, that he is going to get married because \"It Takes a Woman\" to cheerfully do all the household chores.  He plans to travel with Dolly to New York City to march in the Fourteenth Street Association Parade and propose to the widow Irene Molloy, who owns a hat shop there.  Dolly arrives in Yonkers and \"accidentally\" mentions that Irene's first husband might not have died of natural causes, and also mentions that she knows an heiress, Ernestina Money, who may be interested in Horace.  Horace leaves for New York and leaves Cornelius and Barnaby to run the store.\n\nCornelius decides that he and Barnaby need to get out of Yonkers.  They'll go to New York, have a good meal, spend all their money, see the stuffed whale in Barnum's museum, almost get arrested, and each kiss a girl!  They blow up some tomato cans to create a terrible stench and a pretext to close the store.  Dolly mentions that she knows two ladies in New York they should call on: Irene Molloy and her shop assistant, Minnie Fay.  She tells Ermengarde and Ambrose that she'll enter them in the [[polka]] competition at the upscale Harmonia Gardens Restaurant in New York City so Ambrose can demonstrate his ability to be a breadwinner to Horace.  Cornelius, Barnaby, Ambrose, Ermengarde and Dolly take the train to New York (\"Put on Your Sunday Clothes\").\n\nIrene and Minnie open their hat shop for the afternoon.  Irene wants a husband, but does not love Horace Vandergelder.  She declares that she will wear an elaborate hat to impress a gentleman (\"Ribbons Down My Back\").  Cornelius and Barnaby arrive at the shop and pretend to be rich.  Horace and Dolly arrive at the shop, and Cornelius and Barnaby hide from him.  Irene inadvertently mentions that she knows Cornelius Hackl, and Dolly tells her and Horace that even though Cornelius is Horace's clerk by day, he's a New York playboy by night; he's one of ''the'' Hackls.  Minnie screams when she finds Cornelius hiding in the armoire.  Horace is about to open the armoire himself, but Dolly, Irene and Minnie distract him with patriotic sentiments related to subjects like Betsy Ross and The Battle of the Alamo shown in the famous lyrics \"Alamo, remember the Alamo!\" (\"Motherhood March\"). Cornelius sneezes, and Horace storms out, realizing there are men hiding in the shop, but not knowing they are his clerks.\n\nDolly arranges for Cornelius and Barnaby, who are still pretending to be rich, to take the ladies out to dinner to the Harmonia Gardens restaurant to make up for their humiliation.  She teaches Cornelius and Barnaby how to dance since they always have dancing at such establishments (\"Dancing\").  Soon, Cornelius, Irene, Barnaby, and Minnie are happily dancing.  They go to watch the great 14th Street Association Parade together.  Alone, Dolly decides to put her dear departed husband Ephram behind her and to move on with life \"Before the Parade Passes By\".  She asks Ephram's permission to marry Horace, requesting a sign from him.  Dolly catches up with the annoyed Vandergelder, who has missed the whole parade, and she convinces him to give her matchmaking one more chance.  She tells him that Ernestina Money would be perfect for him and asks him to meet her at the swanky Harmonia Gardens that evening.\n\n===Act II===\n[[File:Carol Channing Hello Dolly 1966.jpg|thumb|right|Milo Boulton and [[Carol Channing]] in one of several national tours, 1966 ]]\nCornelius is determined to get a kiss before the night is over, but Barnaby isn't so sure.  As the clerks have no money for a carriage, they tell the girls that walking to the restaurant shows that they've got \"Elegance\".  At the Harmonia Gardens Restaurant, Rudolph, the head waiter, prepares his service crew for Dolly Gallagher Levi's return: their usual lightning service, he tells them, must be \"twice as lightning\" (\"The Waiters' Gallop\").  Horace arrives with his date, but she proves neither as rich nor as elegant as Dolly had implied; furthermore she is soon bored by Horace and leaves, as Dolly had planned she would.\n\nCornelius, Barnaby, and their dates arrive, unaware that Horace is also dining at the restaurant.  Irene and Minnie, inspired by the restaurant's opulence, order the menu's most expensive items. Cornelius and Barnaby grow increasingly anxious as they discover they have little more than a dollar left. Dolly makes her triumphant return to the Harmonia Gardens and is greeted in style by the staff (\"Hello, Dolly!\") She sits in the now-empty seat at Horace's table and proceeds to eat a large, expensive dinner, telling the exasperated Horace that no matter what he says, she will not marry him. Barnaby and Horace hail waiters at the same time, and in the ensuing confusion each drops his wallet and inadvertently picks up the other's. Barnaby is delighted that he can now pay the restaurant bill, while Horace finds only a little spare change.  Barnaby and Cornelius realize that the wallet must belong to Horace. Cornelius, Irene, Barnaby and Minnie try to sneak out during \"The [[Polka]] Contest\", but Horace recognizes them and spots Ermengarde and Ambrose as well. The ensuing free-for-all culminates in a trip to night court.\n\nCornelius and Barnaby confess that they have no money and have never been to New York before. Cornelius declares that even if he has to dig ditches the rest of his life, he'll never forget the day because he had met Irene. Cornelius, Barnaby, and Ambrose then each profess their love for their companion (\"It Only Takes A Moment\"). Dolly convinces the judge that their only crime was being in love. The judge finds everyone innocent and cleared of all charges, but Horace is declared guilty and forced to pay damages. Dolly mentions marriage again, and Horace declares that he wouldn't marry her if she were the last woman in the world.  Dolly angrily bids him \"So Long, Dearie\", telling him that while he's bored and lonely, she'll be living the high life.\n\nThe next morning, back at the hay and feed store, Cornelius and Irene, Barnaby and Minnie, and Ambrose and Ermengarde each set out on new life's paths.  A chastened Horace Vandergelder finally admits that he needs Dolly in his life, but Dolly is unsure about the marriage until her late husband sends her a sign.  Vandergelder spontaneously repeats a saying of Ephram's: \"Money is like manure. It's not worth a thing unless it's spread about, encouraging young things to grow.\"  Horace tells Dolly life would be dull without her, and she promises in return that she'll \"never go away again\" (\"Hello, Dolly\" (reprise)).\n\n==Characters==\n* '''Dolly Gallagher Levi''': A widow in her middle years who has decided to begin her life again.

In his review of the opening night performance, ''[[The New York Times]]'' theatre critic Howard Taubman wrote\n\n<blockquote>''Hello, Dolly!'' ... has qualities of freshness and imagination that are rare in the run of our machine-made musicals. It transmutes the broadly stylized mood of a mettlesome farce into the gusto and colors of the musical stage. ...  Mr. Herman's songs are brisk and pointed and always tuneful ... a shrewdly mischievous performance by Carol Channing. ...  Making the necessary reservations for the unnecessary vulgar and frenzied touches, one is glad to welcome ''Hello, Dolly!'' for its warmth, color and high spirits.<ref>Taubman, Howard. [http://theater2.nytimes.com/mem/theater/treview.html?html_title=&tols_title=HELLO,%20DOLLY!%20(PLAY)&pdate=19640117&byline=By%20HOWARD%20TAUBMAN&id=1077011430206 \"Hello Dolly!\"]. ''The New York Times'', 1964</ref></blockquote>\n\nJohn Chapman of the ''[[Daily News (New York)|New York Daily News]]'' lauded Carol Channing's performance, declaring her \"the most outgoing woman on the musical stage today \u2013 big and warm, all eyes and smiles, in love with everybody in the theatre and possessing a unique voice ranging somewhat upward from a ''basso profundo''.\"  He also wrote, \"I wouldn't say that Jerry Herman's score is memorable.\"<ref name=Suskin>Suskin, Steven. ''Opening Night on Broadway: A Critical Quotebook of the Golden Era of the Musical Theatre'', pp. 297\u2013301. Schirmer Books, New York, 1990. {{ISBN|0-02-872625-1}}</ref> [[New York Post]] critic Richard Watts, Jr., wrote,\n\n<blockquote>The fact that [''Hello, Dolly!''] seems to me short on charm, warmth, and the intangible quality of distinction in no way alters my conviction that it will be an enormous popular success. Herman has composed a score that is always pleasant and agreeably tuneful, although the only number that comes to mind at the moment is the lively title song. His lyrics could be called serviceable.<ref name=Suskin/></blockquote>\n\nIn the ''[[New York Herald Tribune]]'', [[Walter Kerr]] wrote,\n\n<blockquote>''Hello, Dolly!'' is a musical comedy dream, with Carol Channing the girl of it. ... Channing opens wide her big-as-millstone eyes, spreads her white-gloved arms in ecstatic abandon, trots out on a circular runway that surrounds the orchestra, and proceeds to dance rings around the conductor. ... With hair like orange sea foam, a contralto like a horse's neighing, and a confidential swagger, [she is] a musical comedy performer with all the blowzy glamor of the girls on the sheet music of 1916.</blockquote>\n\nKerr perceived deficiencies in the libretto, though, stating that the \"lines are not always as funny as Miss Channing makes them\".<ref name=Suskin/> John McClain of the [[New York Journal American]] particularly praised the staging of the musical, saying that\n\n<blockquote>Gower Champion deserves the big gong for performance beyond the call of duty. Seldom has a corps of dancers brought so much style and excitement to a production which could easily have been pedestrian. ... It is difficult to describe the emotion [the song \"Hello, Dolly!\"] produces. Last night the audience nearly tore up the seats as she led the parade of waiters in a series of encores over the semi-circular runway that extends around the orchestra pit out into the audience, ... a tribute to the personal appeal of Miss Channing and the magical inventiveness of Mr. Champion's staging.<ref name=Suskin/></blockquote>\n\n==Awards and nominations==\n\n===Original Broadway production===\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"width:95%;\"\n|-\n! style=\"width:5%;\"| Year\n! style=\"width:25%;\"| Award \n! style=\"width:40%;\"| Category\n! style=\"width:20%;\"| Nominee\n! style=\"width:10%;\"| Result\n|-\n| rowspan=\"12\" style=\"text-align:center;\"| 1964\n| [[New York Drama Critics Circle|New York Drama Critics Circle Award]]<ref>[http://www.dramacritics.org/dc_pastawards.html#1964 \"New York Drama Critics Past Awards, 1964\"] dramacritics.org, accessed March 29, 2012</ref>\n| colspan=\"2\"| Best Musical\n| {{won}}\n|-\n| rowspan=\"11\"| [[Tony Award]]<ref>[http://www.ibdb.com/production.php?id=2810 \" 'Hello Dolly' Listing, 1964\u20131970\"] Internet Broadway Database, accessed March 29, 2012</ref><ref>[http://www2.broadwayworld.com/tonyawardsyear.cfm?year=1964 \"Tony Awards, 1964\"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120105101119/http://www2.broadwayworld.com/tonyawardsyear.cfm?year=1964 |date=2012-01-05 }} broadwayworld.com, accessed March 29, 2012</ref><ref>[http://www.infoplease.com/ipa/A0153433.html \"Tony Award Winners, 1964\"] infoplease.com, accessed March 29, 2012</ref>\n| colspan=\"2\"| [[Tony Award for Best Musical|Best Musical]]\n| {{won}}\n|-\n| [[Tony Award for Best Book of a Musical|Best Book of a Musical]]\n| [[Michael Stewart (playwright)|Michael Stewart]]\n| {{won}}\n|-\n| [[Tony Award for Best Performance by a Leading Actress in a Musical|Best Performance by a Leading Actress in a Musical]]\n| [[Carol Channing]]\n| {{won}}\n|-\n| [[Tony Award for Best Performance by a Featured Actor in a Musical|Best Performance by a Featured Actor in a Musical]]\n| [[Charles Nelson Reilly]]\n| {{nom}}\n|-\n| [[Tony Award for Best Original Score|Best Original Score]]\n| [[Jerry Herman]]\n| {{won}}\n|-\n| [[Tony Award|Best Producer of a Musical]]\n| [[David Merrick]]\n| {{won}}\n|-\n| [[Tony Award for Best Direction of a Musical|Best Direction of a Musical]]\n| rowspan=\"2\"| [[Gower Champion]]\n| {{won}}\n|-\n| [[Tony Award for Best Choreography|Best Choreography]]\n| {{won}}\n|-\n| [[Tony Award for Best Conductor and Musical Director|Best Conductor and Musical Director]]\n| Shepard Coleman\n| {{won}}\n|-\n| [[Tony Award for Best Scenic Design|Best Scenic Design]]\n| [[Oliver Smith (designer)|Oliver Smith]]\n| {{won}}\n|-\n| [[Tony Award for Best Costume Design|Best Costume Design]]\n| [[Freddy Wittop]]\n| {{won}}\n|-\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"| 1968\n| [[Special Tony Award]]<ref>[http://www2.broadwayworld.com/tonyawardsyear.cfm?year=1968 \"Tony Awards, 1968\"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160407225811/http://www2.broadwayworld.com/tonyawardsyear.cfm?year=1968 |date=2016-04-07 }} broadwayworld.com, accessed March 29, 2012</ref><ref>[http://www.ibdb.com/person.php?id=30650 \"Pearl Bailey Listing, Awards and Nominations\"] Internet Broadway Database, accessed March 29, 2012</ref><ref>[http://www.infoplease.com/ipa/A0153442.html \"Tony Award Winners, 1968\"] infoplease.com, accessed March 29, 2012</ref>\n| Special Award\n| [[Pearl Bailey]]\n| {{won}}\n|-\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"| 1970\n| [[Drama Desk Award]]<ref>[http://www.dramadesk.org/1969_1970dd.html \"Drama Desk, 1969\u20131970\"]{{dead link|date=December 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} dramadesk.org, accessed March 29, 2012</ref><ref>Flinn, Caryl.

The musical follows the story of Dolly Gallagher Levi, a strong-willed matchmaker, as she travels to Yonkers, New York to find a match for the miserly \"well-known unmarried half-a-millionaire\" Horace Vandergelder.\n\n''Hello, Dolly!'' first debuted at the [[Fisher Building|Fisher Theater]] in Detroit on November 18, 1963<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.broadwayworld.com/shows/backstage.php?showid=5050|title=Hello, Dolly! - 1964 Broadway - Backstage & Production Info|website=www.broadwayworld.com|access-date=2019-11-23}}</ref>, directed and choreographed by [[Gower Champion]] and produced by [[David Merrick]], and moved to Broadway in 1964, winning 10 Tony Awards, including Best Musical.

It was also made into the 1969 film ''[[Hello, Dolly! (film)|Hello Dolly!]]'' by [[20th Century Fox]], which won three Academy Awards, including [[Academy Award for Best Original Score|Best Score of a Musical Picture]] and was nominated in four other categories, including [[Academy Award for Best Picture|Best Picture]] at the [[42nd Academy Awards]].\n\n==History==\nThe plot of ''Hello, Dolly!'' originated in the 1835 English play ''A Day Well Spent'' by [[John Oxenford]], which [[Johann Nestroy]] adapted into the farce ''[[Einen Jux will er sich machen]]'' (''He Will Go on a Spree'' or ''He'll Have Himself a Good Time''). [[Thornton Wilder]] adapted Nestroy's play into his 1938 farcical play ''The Merchant of Yonkers''. That play was a flop, so he revised it and retitled it as ''[[The Matchmaker]]'' in 1955, expanding the role of Dolly (played by [[Ruth Gordon]]).<ref name=London2008>[http://www.indielondon.co.uk/Theatre-Review/hello-dolly-new-wimbledon-theatre-review \"Hello Dolly! \u2013 New Wimbledon Theatre\"] IndieLondon, March 2008</ref>  ''The Matchmaker'' became a hit and was much revived and made into [[The Matchmaker (1958 film)|a 1958 film]] starring [[Shirley Booth]].

Dolly makes a living through what she calls \"meddling\" \u2013 matchmaking and numerous sidelines, including dance instruction and [[mandolin]] lessons (\"I Put My Hand In\").  She is currently seeking a wife for grumpy Horace Vandergelder, the well-known half-a-millionaire, but it becomes clear that Dolly intends to marry Horace herself.  Ambrose Kemper, a young artist, wants to marry Horace's weepy niece Ermengarde, but Horace opposes this because Ambrose's vocation does not guarantee a steady living.  Ambrose enlists Dolly's help, and they travel to [[Yonkers, New York]] to visit Horace, who is a prominent citizen there and owns Vandergelder's Hay and Feed.\n\nHorace explains to his two clerks, Cornelius Hackl and Barnaby Tucker, that he is going to get married because \"It Takes a Woman\" to cheerfully do all the household chores.  He plans to travel with Dolly to New York City to march in the Fourteenth Street Association Parade and propose to the widow Irene Molloy, who owns a hat shop there.  Dolly arrives in Yonkers and \"accidentally\" mentions that Irene's first husband might not have died of natural causes, and also mentions that she knows an heiress, Ernestina Money, who may be interested in Horace.  Horace leaves for New York and leaves Cornelius and Barnaby to run the store.\n\nCornelius decides that he and Barnaby need to get out of Yonkers.  They'll go to New York, have a good meal, spend all their money, see the stuffed whale in Barnum's museum, almost get arrested, and each kiss a girl!  They blow up some tomato cans to create a terrible stench and a pretext to close the store.  Dolly mentions that she knows two ladies in New York they should call on: Irene Molloy and her shop assistant, Minnie Fay.  She tells Ermengarde and Ambrose that she'll enter them in the [[polka]] competition at the upscale Harmonia Gardens Restaurant in New York City so Ambrose can demonstrate his ability to be a breadwinner to Horace.  Cornelius, Barnaby, Ambrose, Ermengarde and Dolly take the train to New York (\"Put on Your Sunday Clothes\").\n\nIrene and Minnie open their hat shop for the afternoon.  Irene wants a husband, but does not love Horace Vandergelder.  She declares that she will wear an elaborate hat to impress a gentleman (\"Ribbons Down My Back\").  Cornelius and Barnaby arrive at the shop and pretend to be rich.  Horace and Dolly arrive at the shop, and Cornelius and Barnaby hide from him.  Irene inadvertently mentions that she knows Cornelius Hackl, and Dolly tells her and Horace that even though Cornelius is Horace's clerk by day, he's a New York playboy by night; he's one of ''the'' Hackls.  Minnie screams when she finds Cornelius hiding in the armoire.  Horace is about to open the armoire himself, but Dolly, Irene and Minnie distract him with patriotic sentiments related to subjects like Betsy Ross and The Battle of the Alamo shown in the famous lyrics \"Alamo, remember the Alamo!\" (\"Motherhood March\"). Cornelius sneezes, and Horace storms out, realizing there are men hiding in the shop, but not knowing they are his clerks.\n\nDolly arranges for Cornelius and Barnaby, who are still pretending to be rich, to take the ladies out to dinner to the Harmonia Gardens restaurant to make up for their humiliation.  She teaches Cornelius and Barnaby how to dance since they always have dancing at such establishments (\"Dancing\").  Soon, Cornelius, Irene, Barnaby, and Minnie are happily dancing.  They go to watch the great 14th Street Association Parade together.  Alone, Dolly decides to put her dear departed husband Ephram behind her and to move on with life \"Before the Parade Passes By\".  She asks Ephram's permission to marry Horace, requesting a sign from him.  Dolly catches up with the annoyed Vandergelder, who has missed the whole parade, and she convinces him to give her matchmaking one more chance.  She tells him that Ernestina Money would be perfect for him and asks him to meet her at the swanky Harmonia Gardens that evening.\n\n===Act II===\n[[File:Carol Channing Hello Dolly 1966.jpg|thumb|right|Milo Boulton and [[Carol Channing]] in one of several national tours, 1966 ]]\nCornelius is determined to get a kiss before the night is over, but Barnaby isn't so sure.  As the clerks have no money for a carriage, they tell the girls that walking to the restaurant shows that they've got \"Elegance\".  At the Harmonia Gardens Restaurant, Rudolph, the head waiter, prepares his service crew for Dolly Gallagher Levi's return: their usual lightning service, he tells them, must be \"twice as lightning\" (\"The Waiters' Gallop\").  Horace arrives with his date, but she proves neither as rich nor as elegant as Dolly had implied; furthermore she is soon bored by Horace and leaves, as Dolly had planned she would.\n\nCornelius, Barnaby, and their dates arrive, unaware that Horace is also dining at the restaurant.  Irene and Minnie, inspired by the restaurant's opulence, order the menu's most expensive items. Cornelius and Barnaby grow increasingly anxious as they discover they have little more than a dollar left. Dolly makes her triumphant return to the Harmonia Gardens and is greeted in style by the staff (\"Hello, Dolly!\") She sits in the now-empty seat at Horace's table and proceeds to eat a large, expensive dinner, telling the exasperated Horace that no matter what he says, she will not marry him. Barnaby and Horace hail waiters at the same time, and in the ensuing confusion each drops his wallet and inadvertently picks up the other's. Barnaby is delighted that he can now pay the restaurant bill, while Horace finds only a little spare change.  Barnaby and Cornelius realize that the wallet must belong to Horace. Cornelius, Irene, Barnaby and Minnie try to sneak out during \"The [[Polka]] Contest\", but Horace recognizes them and spots Ermengarde and Ambrose as well. The ensuing free-for-all culminates in a trip to night court.\n\nCornelius and Barnaby confess that they have no money and have never been to New York before. Cornelius declares that even if he has to dig ditches the rest of his life, he'll never forget the day because he had met Irene. Cornelius, Barnaby, and Ambrose then each profess their love for their companion (\"It Only Takes A Moment\"). Dolly convinces the judge that their only crime was being in love. The judge finds everyone innocent and cleared of all charges, but Horace is declared guilty and forced to pay damages. Dolly mentions marriage again, and Horace declares that he wouldn't marry her if she were the last woman in the world.  Dolly angrily bids him \"So Long, Dearie\", telling him that while he's bored and lonely, she'll be living the high life.\n\nThe next morning, back at the hay and feed store, Cornelius and Irene, Barnaby and Minnie, and Ambrose and Ermengarde each set out on new life's paths.  A chastened Horace Vandergelder finally admits that he needs Dolly in his life, but Dolly is unsure about the marriage until her late husband sends her a sign.  Vandergelder spontaneously repeats a saying of Ephram's: \"Money is like manure. It's not worth a thing unless it's spread about, encouraging young things to grow.\"  Horace tells Dolly life would be dull without her, and she promises in return that she'll \"never go away again\" (\"Hello, Dolly\" (reprise)).\n\n==Characters==\n* '''Dolly Gallagher Levi''': A widow in her middle years who has decided to begin her life again.

In his review of the opening night performance, ''[[The New York Times]]'' theatre critic Howard Taubman wrote\n\n<blockquote>''Hello, Dolly!'' ... has qualities of freshness and imagination that are rare in the run of our machine-made musicals. It transmutes the broadly stylized mood of a mettlesome farce into the gusto and colors of the musical stage. ...  Mr. Herman's songs are brisk and pointed and always tuneful ... a shrewdly mischievous performance by Carol Channing. ...  Making the necessary reservations for the unnecessary vulgar and frenzied touches, one is glad to welcome ''Hello, Dolly!'' for its warmth, color and high spirits.<ref>Taubman, Howard. [http://theater2.nytimes.com/mem/theater/treview.html?html_title=&tols_title=HELLO,%20DOLLY!%20(PLAY)&pdate=19640117&byline=By%20HOWARD%20TAUBMAN&id=1077011430206 \"Hello Dolly!\"]. ''The New York Times'', 1964</ref></blockquote>\n\nJohn Chapman of the ''[[Daily News (New York)|New York Daily News]]'' lauded Carol Channing's performance, declaring her \"the most outgoing woman on the musical stage today \u2013 big and warm, all eyes and smiles, in love with everybody in the theatre and possessing a unique voice ranging somewhat upward from a ''basso profundo''.\"  He also wrote, \"I wouldn't say that Jerry Herman's score is memorable.\"<ref name=Suskin>Suskin, Steven. ''Opening Night on Broadway: A Critical Quotebook of the Golden Era of the Musical Theatre'', pp. 297\u2013301. Schirmer Books, New York, 1990. {{ISBN|0-02-872625-1}}</ref> [[New York Post]] critic Richard Watts, Jr., wrote,\n\n<blockquote>The fact that [''Hello, Dolly!''] seems to me short on charm, warmth, and the intangible quality of distinction in no way alters my conviction that it will be an enormous popular success. Herman has composed a score that is always pleasant and agreeably tuneful, although the only number that comes to mind at the moment is the lively title song. His lyrics could be called serviceable.<ref name=Suskin/></blockquote>\n\nIn the ''[[New York Herald Tribune]]'', [[Walter Kerr]] wrote,\n\n<blockquote>''Hello, Dolly!'' is a musical comedy dream, with Carol Channing the girl of it. ... Channing opens wide her big-as-millstone eyes, spreads her white-gloved arms in ecstatic abandon, trots out on a circular runway that surrounds the orchestra, and proceeds to dance rings around the conductor. ... With hair like orange sea foam, a contralto like a horse's neighing, and a confidential swagger, [she is] a musical comedy performer with all the blowzy glamor of the girls on the sheet music of 1916.</blockquote>\n\nKerr perceived deficiencies in the libretto, though, stating that the \"lines are not always as funny as Miss Channing makes them\".<ref name=Suskin/> John McClain of the [[New York Journal American]] particularly praised the staging of the musical, saying that\n\n<blockquote>Gower Champion deserves the big gong for performance beyond the call of duty. Seldom has a corps of dancers brought so much style and excitement to a production which could easily have been pedestrian. ... It is difficult to describe the emotion [the song \"Hello, Dolly!\"] produces. Last night the audience nearly tore up the seats as she led the parade of waiters in a series of encores over the semi-circular runway that extends around the orchestra pit out into the audience, ... a tribute to the personal appeal of Miss Channing and the magical inventiveness of Mr. Champion's staging.<ref name=Suskin/></blockquote>\n\n==Awards and nominations==\n\n===Original Broadway production===\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"width:95%;\"\n|-\n! style=\"width:5%;\"| Year\n! style=\"width:25%;\"| Award \n! style=\"width:40%;\"| Category\n! style=\"width:20%;\"| Nominee\n! style=\"width:10%;\"| Result\n|-\n| rowspan=\"12\" style=\"text-align:center;\"| 1964\n| [[New York Drama Critics Circle|New York Drama Critics Circle Award]]<ref>[http://www.dramacritics.org/dc_pastawards.html#1964 \"New York Drama Critics Past Awards, 1964\"] dramacritics.org, accessed March 29, 2012</ref>\n| colspan=\"2\"| Best Musical\n| {{won}}\n|-\n| rowspan=\"11\"| [[Tony Award]]<ref>[http://www.ibdb.com/production.php?id=2810 \" 'Hello Dolly' Listing, 1964\u20131970\"] Internet Broadway Database, accessed March 29, 2012</ref><ref>[http://www2.broadwayworld.com/tonyawardsyear.cfm?year=1964 \"Tony Awards, 1964\"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120105101119/http://www2.broadwayworld.com/tonyawardsyear.cfm?year=1964 |date=2012-01-05 }} broadwayworld.com, accessed March 29, 2012</ref><ref>[http://www.infoplease.com/ipa/A0153433.html \"Tony Award Winners, 1964\"] infoplease.com, accessed March 29, 2012</ref>\n| colspan=\"2\"| [[Tony Award for Best Musical|Best Musical]]\n| {{won}}\n|-\n| [[Tony Award for Best Book of a Musical|Best Book of a Musical]]\n| [[Michael Stewart (playwright)|Michael Stewart]]\n| {{won}}\n|-\n| [[Tony Award for Best Performance by a Leading Actress in a Musical|Best Performance by a Leading Actress in a Musical]]\n| [[Carol Channing]]\n| {{won}}\n|-\n| [[Tony Award for Best Performance by a Featured Actor in a Musical|Best Performance by a Featured Actor in a Musical]]\n| [[Charles Nelson Reilly]]\n| {{nom}}\n|-\n| [[Tony Award for Best Original Score|Best Original Score]]\n| [[Jerry Herman]]\n| {{won}}\n|-\n| [[Tony Award|Best Producer of a Musical]]\n| [[David Merrick]]\n| {{won}}\n|-\n| [[Tony Award for Best Direction of a Musical|Best Direction of a Musical]]\n| rowspan=\"2\"| [[Gower Champion]]\n| {{won}}\n|-\n| [[Tony Award for Best Choreography|Best Choreography]]\n| {{won}}\n|-\n| [[Tony Award for Best Conductor and Musical Director|Best Conductor and Musical Director]]\n| Shepard Coleman\n| {{won}}\n|-\n| [[Tony Award for Best Scenic Design|Best Scenic Design]]\n| [[Oliver Smith (designer)|Oliver Smith]]\n| {{won}}\n|-\n| [[Tony Award for Best Costume Design|Best Costume Design]]\n| [[Freddy Wittop]]\n| {{won}}\n|-\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"| 1968\n| [[Special Tony Award]]<ref>[http://www2.broadwayworld.com/tonyawardsyear.cfm?year=1968 \"Tony Awards, 1968\"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160407225811/http://www2.broadwayworld.com/tonyawardsyear.cfm?year=1968 |date=2016-04-07 }} broadwayworld.com, accessed March 29, 2012</ref><ref>[http://www.ibdb.com/person.php?id=30650 \"Pearl Bailey Listing, Awards and Nominations\"] Internet Broadway Database, accessed March 29, 2012</ref><ref>[http://www.infoplease.com/ipa/A0153442.html \"Tony Award Winners, 1968\"] infoplease.com, accessed March 29, 2012</ref>\n| Special Award\n| [[Pearl Bailey]]\n| {{won}}\n|-\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"| 1970\n| [[Drama Desk Award]]<ref>[http://www.dramadesk.org/1969_1970dd.html \"Drama Desk, 1969\u20131970\"]{{dead link|date=December 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} dramadesk.org, accessed March 29, 2012</ref><ref>Flinn, Caryl.

He is an Olympic silver medalist in the [[Gymnastics at the 2004 Summer Olympics \u2013 Men's artistic team all-around|team competition]] at the [[2004 Summer Olympics|2004 Olympics]] and a two-time Olympian ([[United States at the 2000 Summer Olympics|2000]], [[United States at the 2004 Summer Olympics|2004]]). He also was a member of the silver-medal winning team at the [[2003 World Artistic Gymnastics Championships|2003 World Championships]]. Hamm was named to the [[United States at the 2008 Summer Olympics|2008 Olympic team]], but withdrew from it due to injury.\n\n==Personal life==\nHamm is the son of Sandy and Cecily Hamm. His twin brother, [[Paul Hamm]], is also a gymnast and Olympic medalist. His older sister, Elizabeth (Betsy), is a former member of USA Gymnastics Senior National Team. She competed for the University of Florida, where she became the NCAA\u2019s national balance beam champion in 1998 and was a seven-time All-American. His father was an All-American springboard diver.\n\nIn 2010, Hamm enrolled at [[Concordia University Wisconsin]] to study [[pharmacology]]. In 2014, he successfully completed his studies and earned his [[Doctor of Pharmacy]] degree. He is currently a practicing Pharm.D.<ref>[https://www.linkedin.com/pub/morgan-hamm/93/63/428]</ref>\n\n==Career==\nHamm competed at the [[2000 Olympics]] in [[Sydney]] at age 17, and the [[2004 Summer Olympics]] in [[Athens]], alongside his twin brother [[Paul Hamm|Paul]]. At the 2004 Olympics, he won the silver medal with the U.S. team in the team competition. Morgan's contribution to this medal-winning performance was vital as he performed on four of the six apparatus and was the highest scorer for the team on vault and high bar. He also competed in floor and high bar finals, and only a tie-breaker kept him from winning the bronze medal on the latter event. Morgan was also a member of the U.S. team at the [[2003 World Artistic Gymnastics Championships|2003 World Championships]] that won a silver medal in the team competition.\n\nIn February 2007, Hamm announced that he would return to competitive gymnastics. He competed at the 2007 Visa National Championships, on floor and pommel horse. He competed at the 2008 National Championships and at the 2008 Olympic Trials. He was warned by the [[United States Anti-Doping Agency]] in July for testing positive for [[glucocorticosteroid]],<ref>The Associated Press and McClatchy Newspapers. \"[http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/html/olympics/2008080753_oly30.html Olympics | Gymnast Morgan Hamm gets OK to compete] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110102061551/http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/html/olympics/2008080753_oly30.html |date=January 2, 2011 }}\", ''[[The Seattle Times]]'' 30 July 2008.

He is an Olympic silver medalist in the [[Gymnastics at the 2004 Summer Olympics \u2013 Men's artistic team all-around|team competition]] at the [[2004 Summer Olympics|2004 Olympics]] and a two-time Olympian ([[United States at the 2000 Summer Olympics|2000]], [[United States at the 2004 Summer Olympics|2004]]). He also was a member of the silver-medal winning team at the [[2003 World Artistic Gymnastics Championships|2003 World Championships]]. Hamm was named to the [[United States at the 2008 Summer Olympics|2008 Olympic team]], but withdrew from it due to injury.\n\n==Personal life==\nHamm is the son of Sandy and Cecily Hamm. His twin brother, [[Paul Hamm]], is also a gymnast and Olympic medalist. His older sister, Elizabeth (Betsy), is a former member of USA Gymnastics Senior National Team. She competed for the University of Florida, where she became the NCAA\u2019s national balance beam champion in 1998 and was a seven-time All-American. His father was an All-American springboard diver.\n\nIn 2010, Hamm enrolled at [[Concordia University Wisconsin]] to study [[pharmacology]]. In 2014, he successfully completed his studies and earned his [[Doctor of Pharmacy]] degree. He is currently a practicing Pharm.D.<ref>[https://www.linkedin.com/pub/morgan-hamm/93/63/428]</ref>\n\n==Career==\nHamm competed at the [[2000 Olympics]] in [[Sydney]] at age 17, and the [[2004 Summer Olympics]] in [[Athens]], alongside his twin brother [[Paul Hamm|Paul]]. At the 2004 Olympics, he won the silver medal with the U.S. team in the team competition. Morgan's contribution to this medal-winning performance was vital as he performed on four of the six apparatus and was the highest scorer for the team on vault and high bar. He also competed in floor and high bar finals, and only a tie-breaker kept him from winning the bronze medal on the latter event. Morgan was also a member of the U.S. team at the [[2003 World Artistic Gymnastics Championships|2003 World Championships]] that won a silver medal in the team competition.\n\nIn February 2007, Hamm announced that he would return to competitive gymnastics. He competed at the 2007 Visa National Championships, on floor and pommel horse. He competed at the 2008 National Championships and at the 2008 Olympic Trials. He was warned by the [[United States Anti-Doping Agency]] in July for testing positive for [[glucocorticosteroid]],<ref>The Associated Press and McClatchy Newspapers. \"[http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/html/olympics/2008080753_oly30.html Olympics | Gymnast Morgan Hamm gets OK to compete] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110102061551/http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/html/olympics/2008080753_oly30.html |date=January 2, 2011 }}\", ''[[The Seattle Times]]'' 30 July 2008.
