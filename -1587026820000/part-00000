This includes putting public pressure on companies that are currently involved in fossil fuel extraction to invest in renewable energy.\n\nThe [[Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change]] found that all future carbon dioxide emissions must be less than 1,000 gigatonnes to provide a 66% chance of [[avoiding dangerous climate change]]; this figure includes all sources of carbon emissions. To avoid dangerous climate change, only 33% of known extractable fossil fuel of known reserves can be used; this carbon budget can also be depleted by an increase in other carbon emission sources such as deforestation and cement production. It is claimed that, if other carbon emissions increase significantly, then only 10% of the fossil fuel reserves can be used to stay within projected safe limits.<ref name=\"How much of the world's fossil fuel can we burn?\">{{cite web|last1=Clark|first1=Duncan|title=How much of the world's fossil fuel can we burn?|url=https://www.theguardian.com/environment/keep-it-in-the-ground-blog/2015/mar/25/what-numbers-tell-about-how-much-fossil-fuel-reserves-cant-burn|work=The Guardian|accessdate=29 March 2015}}</ref>\n\nFurthermore, according to the US Environmental Protection Agency, Earth's average temperature has risen by {{convert|1.4|F-change|C-change|order=flip}} over the past century, and is predicted to rise another {{convert|2|to|11.5|F-change|C-change|order=flip}} over the next hundred years with continued carbon emission rates.

It recommended that the university divest from companies that \"blatantly disregard the international effort to limit the rise in average global temperatures to not more than one and a half degrees Celsius above pre-industrial averages by 2050...These are fossil fuels companies whose actions are irreconcilable with achieving internationally agreed goals.\"<ref name=utoronto/>\n\nFranta identified this response as the Toronto Principle, which, as he argues, \"aligns rhetoric and action. It suggests that it is all institutions' responsibility to give life to the Paris agreement. Harvard could adopt this Toronto principle, too, and the world would be better for it.\"<ref name=\"Arabella2014\" /> Franta also identified how the Toronto Principle would be put into practice, which includes \"moving investments away from coal companies and coal-fired power plants, companies seeking non-conventional or aggressive fossil fuel development (such as oil from the Arctic or tar sands), and possibly also companies that distort public policies or deceive the public on climate. At present, these activities are incompatible with the agreement in Paris.\"<ref name=\"How much of the world's fossil fuel can we burn?\" /> In adhering to the Toronto Principle, Franta argues that leading institutions can use their status and power to meaningfully respond to the challenge of [[climate change]], and act based on the goals at the Paris Agreement.\n\n====Lofoten Declaration====\n{{Main|Lofoten Declaration}}\nThe Lofoten Declaration (2017) calls for curtailing [[hydrocarbon exploration]] and expansion of [[fossil fuel]] [[proven reserves|reserves]].

This includes putting public pressure on companies that are currently involved in fossil fuel extraction to invest in renewable energy.\n\nThe [[Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change]] found that all future carbon dioxide emissions must be less than 1,000 gigatonnes to provide a 66% chance of [[avoiding dangerous climate change]]; this figure includes all sources of carbon emissions. To avoid dangerous climate change, only 33% of known extractable fossil fuel of known reserves can be used; this carbon budget can also be depleted by an increase in other carbon emission sources such as deforestation and cement production. It is claimed that, if other carbon emissions increase significantly, then only 10% of the fossil fuel reserves can be used to stay within projected safe limits.<ref name=\"How much of the world's fossil fuel can we burn?\">{{cite web|last1=Clark|first1=Duncan|title=How much of the world's fossil fuel can we burn?|url=https://www.theguardian.com/environment/keep-it-in-the-ground-blog/2015/mar/25/what-numbers-tell-about-how-much-fossil-fuel-reserves-cant-burn|work=The Guardian|accessdate=29 March 2015}}</ref>\n\nFurthermore, according to the US Environmental Protection Agency, Earth's average temperature has risen by {{convert|1.4|F-change|C-change|order=flip}} over the past century, and is predicted to rise another {{convert|2|to|11.5|F-change|C-change|order=flip}} over the next hundred years with continued carbon emission rates.

It recommended that the university divest from companies that \"blatantly disregard the international effort to limit the rise in average global temperatures to not more than one and a half degrees Celsius above pre-industrial averages by 2050...These are fossil fuels companies whose actions are irreconcilable with achieving internationally agreed goals.\"<ref name=utoronto/>\n\nFranta identified this response as the Toronto Principle, which, as he argues, \"aligns rhetoric and action. It suggests that it is all institutions' responsibility to give life to the Paris agreement. Harvard could adopt this Toronto principle, too, and the world would be better for it.\"<ref name=\"Arabella2014\" /> Franta also identified how the Toronto Principle would be put into practice, which includes \"moving investments away from coal companies and coal-fired power plants, companies seeking non-conventional or aggressive fossil fuel development (such as oil from the Arctic or tar sands), and possibly also companies that distort public policies or deceive the public on climate. At present, these activities are incompatible with the agreement in Paris.\"<ref name=\"How much of the world's fossil fuel can we burn?\" /> In adhering to the Toronto Principle, Franta argues that leading institutions can use their status and power to meaningfully respond to the challenge of [[climate change]], and act based on the goals at the Paris Agreement.\n\n====Lofoten Declaration====\n{{Main|Lofoten Declaration}}\nThe Lofoten Declaration (2017) calls for curtailing [[hydrocarbon exploration]] and expansion of [[fossil fuel]] [[proven reserves|reserves]].

Singapore lies about one degree of latitude ({{Convert|137|km|disp=or}}) north of the [[equator]], and is situated off the southern tip of the [[Malay peninsula]], and, by extension, the [[Extreme points of Asia|southernmost extremity]] of continental [[Eurasia]].

The island country is enveloped by the littoral waters of the [[Straits of Johor|Johore Strait]] to its north and the [[Singapore Strait]] to its south, and is geographically positioned within the confluence of the Indian and Pacific Oceans, being bounded by the [[Malacca Strait]] to its west and the [[South China Sea]] to its east. The country's territory, which is [[Malay Archipelago|archipelagic]], is composed of one [[Pulau Ujong|main island]], [[List of islands of Singapore|63 satellite islands and islets]], and [[Pedra Branca, Singapore|one outlying islet]], the combined area of which has increased by 25% since the country's independence as a result of extensive [[land reclamation]] projects.\n\nThroughout its millennia-long history, Singapore\u2014historically known by the names ''Pulau Ujong'', ''Temasek'', and subsequently ''Singapura''\u2014was a maritime [[Emporium (antiquity)|emporium]] that fell under the suzerainty of several successive Malay polities: initially a series of ancient to medieval Hindu-Buddhist [[thalassocracy|thalassocratic]] empires, subsequently a medieval [[Kingdom of Singapura|localised Hindu-Buddhist kingdom]], and ultimately two medieval and [[Early modern period|early modern]] sultanates.<ref>[https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/singapore-to-mark-200th-anniversary-of-raffles-arrival Singapore to mark 200th anniversary of Raffles' arrival, Singapore News & Top Stories - The Straits Times<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>{{refn|Singapore fell under the ''[[Mandala (political model)|mandala]]'' (suzerainty) of at least two Hindu-Buddhist thalassocracies (maritime empires): The [[Melayu Kingdom]] (also known as Dharmasraya or Jambi), and [[Srivijaya]].

Following Srivijaya's decline, a localised Hindu-Buddhist kingdom\u2014the [[Kingdom of Singapura]]\u2014was founded on the main island.

The Annals state that Nila Utama, who discovered the island on a voyage and subsequently founded the Kingdom of Singapura, sought to give the island a regal name after witnessing a lion stalking its shores. However, it is unlikely that lions ever lived on the island; the prince probably saw a [[Malayan tiger]], the largest [[big cat]] species endemic to the Malay peninsula. The second hypothesis, drawn from the ''[[Tom\u00e9 Pires#The Suma Oriental|Suma Oriental]]'', a Portuguese historical source, postulates that the name was given by another Srivijayan Raja, the 14th-century [[Parameswara (king)|Parameswara]] of Palembang. According to the source, Parameswara was the actual founder of the Kingdom of Singapura, usurping the throne of the preceding Temasek kingdom from its ruler, installing himself as Raja, and rechristening the kingdom ''Singapura'' in order to legitimise his claim over the island with a regal name of his own making. Although the name Parameswara and the narrative of usurpation are not mentioned in the Malay Annals, it is believed that Iskandar Shah\u2014a ruler identified by the Annals to be the fifth and final Raja of Singapura, and the subsequent founder of the [[Malacca Sultanate]]\u2014corresponds with the Parameswara of the ''Suma Oriental'' based on the extreme similarity of their biographies.<ref name=\"turnbull\" />\n\nFor several millennia prior to the adoption of ''Singapura'' as the island's name, its linguistic ancestor\u2014''Si\u1e43hapura''\u2014had an illustrious history as an ubiquitous and prestigious place name in use in Dharmic literature and across the ancient and medieval Hindu-Buddhist polities of South and Southeast Asia.

Much of the infrastructure had been destroyed during the war, including harbour facilities at the [[Port of Singapore]]. There was also a shortage of food leading to malnutrition, disease, and rampant crime and violence. High food prices, unemployment, and workers' discontent culminated into a series of strikes in 1947 causing massive stoppages in public transport and other services.

It was thought that the merger would benefit the economy by creating a common market which will support new industries, solving the ongoing unemployment woes in Singapore. However, a sizeable pro-communist wing of the PAP was strongly opposed to the merger, fearing a loss of influence, and hence formed the [[Barisan Sosialis]], splitting from the PAP.<ref>{{cite book|last=Lee|first=T.

UMNO, who was initially sceptical of the idea of a merger as they distrust the PAP government and were concerned that the large Chinese population in Singapore would alter the racial balance on which their political power base depended, changed their minds about the merger after being afraid of being taken over by pro-communists.

the '''Republic of Singapore''', is a [[sovereign state|sovereign]] [[city-state]] and [[island country]] located in [[maritime Southeast Asia]]. Singapore lies about one degree of latitude ({{Convert|137|km|disp=or}}) north of the [[equator]], and is situated off the southern tip of the [[Malay peninsula]], and, by extension, the [[Extreme points of Asia|southernmost extremity]] of continental [[Eurasia]]. The island country is wedged between western [[Indonesia]] and [[peninsular Malaysia]], sharing its [[Indonesia\u2013Singapore border|southern maritime border]] with the [[Riau archipelago]] of the former's [[Riau Islands]] province, and its [[Malaysia\u2013Singapore border|northern, western, and eastern maritime borders]] with the latter's [[Johor|Johor state]]; it is additionally in the vicinity of [[Sumatra]] to its west and [[Borneo]] to its east. The island country is enveloped by the littoral waters of the [[Straits of Johor|Johore Strait]] to its north and the [[Singapore Strait]] to its south, and is geographically positioned within the confluence of the Indian and Pacific Oceans, being bounded by the [[Malacca Strait]] to its west and the [[South China Sea]] to its east. The country's territory, which is [[Malay Archipelago|archipelagic]], is composed of one [[Pulau Ujong|main island]], [[List of islands of Singapore|63 satellite islands and islets]], and [[Pedra Branca, Singapore|one outlying islet]], the combined area of which has increased by 25% since the country's independence as a result of extensive [[land reclamation]] projects.\n\nThroughout its millennia-long history, Singapore\u2014historically known by the names ''Pulau Ujong'', ''Temasek'', and subsequently ''Singapura''\u2014was a maritime [[Emporium (antiquity)|emporium]] that fell under the suzerainty of several successive Malay polities: initially a series of ancient to medieval Hindu-Buddhist [[thalassocracy|thalassocratic]] empires, subsequently a medieval [[Kingdom of Singapura|localised Hindu-Buddhist kingdom]], and ultimately two medieval and [[Early modern period|early modern]] sultanates.<ref>[https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/singapore-to-mark-200th-anniversary-of-raffles-arrival Singapore to mark 200th anniversary of Raffles' arrival, Singapore News & Top Stories - The Straits Times<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>{{refn|Singapore fell under the ''[[Mandala (political model)|mandala]]'' (suzerainty) of at least two Hindu-Buddhist thalassocracies (maritime empires): The [[Melayu Kingdom]] (also known as Dharmasraya or Jambi), and [[Srivijaya]].

Following Srivijaya's decline, a localised Hindu-Buddhist kingdom\u2014the [[Kingdom of Singapura]]\u2014was founded on the main island. The Kingdom of Singapura was the final Dharmic polity to have exercised control of Singapore.

In 1959, following a protracted period of agitation against colonial rule, Singapore was granted limited autonomy; in 1963, it became fully emancipated from the British Empire upon its [[Malaysia Agreement|federation]] with the territories of the erstwhile [[British Malaya]] and [[British Borneo]] to form the new country of [[Malaysia]].{{refn|Singapore federated with three other entities to form the country of Malaysia. <br><br> The first entity was the [[Federation of Malaya]], which was the decolonised agglomeration of the peninsular territories of the erstwhile [[British Malaya]]\u2014composed of the [[Unfederated Malay States]], the [[Federated Malay States]], and the peninsular [[Straits Settlements]] of [[Penang]], [[Malacca]], and [[Manjung District|Dindings]]. <br><br> The second and third entities were the [[British Borneo|British Bornean]] crown colonies of [[Crown Colony of Sarawak|Sarawak]] and [[Crown Colony of North Borneo|North Borneo]], respectively; the latter came to be known as [[Sabah]] after the formation of Malaysia.|group=Note}} However, after [[Singapore in Malaysia|two tumultuous years]] as a constituent state of the Malaysian Federation, marred by violent ethnoreligious [[Ethnic conflict|strife]] and other intractable differences between [[Bumiputera (Malaysia)|indigenous]] and non-indigenous groups, Singapore was [[August 1965#August 9, 1965 (Monday)|expelled]] in 1965, becoming the first country in modern history to gain independence against its will\u2014although this narrative remains contentious.{{refn|Singapore's secession from the Malaysian Federation in 1965 is a contentious issue without a set historical narrative. The popular narrative is that Singapore was expelled from Malaysia, becoming the first country in modern history to gain independence against its will. This is technically correct, as the Malaysian Parliament voted unanimously in favour of Singapore's expulsion from the Federation. <br><br> However, historians believe that Singapore's political leaders might have been acutely aware of the prospect of a breakaway from the very start because of the domestic instability brought about by the incompatibility of worldviews within the Federation\u2014the most major source of acrimony being the steadfast insistence of Singapore's leaders on the concept of a [[Malaysian Malaysia]], not a [[Malays (ethnic group)|Malay]]-dominated Malaysia ''([[Ketuanan Melayu]])''. It has even been suggested that some of Singapore's political leaders might have actively precipitated the breakaway by negotiating the terms of secession in backdoor meetings.<ref>[https://www.mentalfloss.com/article/52146/was-singapore%E2%80%99s-independence-accident Was Singapore\u2019s Independence an Accident? | Mental Floss<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>|group=Note}} After early years of [[History of the Republic of Singapore#1965 to 1979|turbulence]], the newly sovereign nation\u2014viewed as a nonviable state by international observers due to its [[microstate|diminutiveness]], geostrategic vulnerability, absence of natural resources, and lack of a [[hinterland]]\u2014defied odds by rapidly developing and industrialising under the leadership of the inaugural [[People's Action Party]] to become a [[World Bank high-income economy|high-income economy]] and developed country within a single generation, dubbed as the \"[[Singapore Miracle]]\".\n\nSingapore is a [[Unitary state|unitary]] [[Parliamentary republic|parliamentary]] [[Constitution|constitutional]] [[republic]] with a [[Unicameralism|unicameral]] legislature that has been characterised by [[Dominant-party system|dominant-party rule]] since independence.

The Annals state that Nila Utama, who discovered the island on a voyage and subsequently founded the Kingdom of Singapura, sought to give the island a regal name after witnessing a lion stalking its shores. However, it is unlikely that lions ever lived on the island; the prince probably saw a [[Malayan tiger]], the largest [[big cat]] species endemic to the Malay peninsula. The second hypothesis, drawn from the ''[[Tom\u00e9 Pires#The Suma Oriental|Suma Oriental]]'', a Portuguese historical source, postulates that the name was given by another Srivijayan Raja, the 14th-century [[Parameswara (king)|Parameswara]] of Palembang. According to the source, Parameswara was the actual founder of the Kingdom of Singapura, usurping the throne of the preceding Temasek kingdom from its ruler, installing himself as Raja, and rechristening the kingdom ''Singapura'' in order to legitimise his claim over the island with a regal name of his own making. Although the name Parameswara and the narrative of usurpation are not mentioned in the Malay Annals, it is believed that Iskandar Shah\u2014a ruler identified by the Annals to be the fifth and final Raja of Singapura, and the subsequent founder of the [[Malacca Sultanate]]\u2014corresponds with the Parameswara of the ''Suma Oriental'' based on the extreme similarity of their biographies.<ref name=\"turnbull\" />\n\nFor several millennia prior to the adoption of ''Singapura'' as the island's name, its linguistic ancestor\u2014''Si\u1e43hapura''\u2014had an illustrious history as an ubiquitous and prestigious place name in use in Dharmic literature and across the ancient and medieval Hindu-Buddhist polities of South and Southeast Asia.

High food prices, unemployment, and workers' discontent culminated into a series of strikes in 1947 causing massive stoppages in public transport and other services.

During the 2006 season, the track was having financial difficulties with paying the drivers, and by mid-July Severson shut down the track after his arrest on federal charges of bank fraud.  Further investigation found that in 2002 and 2003, Severson had received bank loans from Mark Hardyman, the president of the First National Bank of Blanchardville, and used his towing business and Dells Raceway Park as collateral. To cover up the loans from the bank's board of directors, Severson had written several worthless checks worth millions of dollars.  The bank eventually did collapse in 2003. Severson was sentenced in February 2008 to nearly 12 years in federal prison after being convicted of 28 felony counts.  Severson was ordered to repay the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation about $6.4 million that he was responsible for in the intended loss to the bank, less about $700,000 the FDIC received from another bank that bought some of Severson's loans which used the track as collateral.\n\n==Lyle Nabbefeldt Memorial and special events==\nOn May 26, 1973 Wisconsin Rapids driver Lyle Nabbefeldt lost control of his car entering turn one during time trials, crashed into the outside wall and was killed instantly.  The Lyle Nabbefeldt Memorial began in 1974 as a tribute to the driver, and it became the Dells' annual marquee event until its last running in the late 1990s.  The first running of the event was a 100-lap feature, but the feature format was changed the next year to running two 55-lap features with an overall champion being declared.  The change was made to reflect the number 55s that Nabbefeldt ran throughout his racing career.  Another unique part of the Nabbefeldt Memorial was the winner's trophy, known as the Nabbefeldt Traveling Trophy.  The overall champion of the Nabbefeldt Memorial was allowed to keep the trophy until the following year's running of the race.  If any one driver was able to win the Nabbefeldt Memorial three years in a row, that driver would take permanent possession of the trophy and a new one would be introduced.  Dick Trickle won the event two years in a row on two occasions, but Rick Wateski is the only driver to have won the event three years in a row (1991/1992/1993).  Wayne Lensing, the current owner of Dells Raceway Park, announced that The Nabbefeldt Memorial was being revived for 2015, as part of a series of CWRA Challenge Series races.\n\nThe track also announced two new marquee Super Late Model events in 2015. The first event was the Icebreaker 100, an event held in April before other tracks opened. The second event was the Falloween 150, which was held in late October after all other late model events in the state of Wisconsin had concluded.\n\n==Track Records==\n\u2022 Super Late Model                    [[Ty Majeski]]--13.075 on 8-31-19<BR>\n\u2022 TUNDRA Super Late Model Series      Corey Jankowski--13.273 on 9-01-11<BR>\n\u2022 Late Model                          Rich Schumann, Jr.--13.925 on 5-7-16<BR>\n\u2022 Modifieds                           Jerry Blystone--14.293 on 8-31-19<BR> \n\u2022 Sportsmen                           Dave Trute--14.475 on 5-6-17<BR>\n\u2022 Mid-American Stock Car Series       Brian Back--14.361 on 7-24-10<BR>\n\u2022 Great Northern Sportsmen Series     Dave Trute--14.832 on 4-17-16<BR>\n\u2022 Midwest Dash Series                 George Sparkman--15.832 on 4-9-17<BR>\n\u2022 Pure Stock                          Mark Hohl--15.444 on 9-22-12<BR>\n\u2022 Super Stock                         Mike Lichtfeld--14.695 on 8-09-08<BR>\n\u2022 Bandit                              Abe Bires--16.215 on 8-26-17<BR>\n\u2022 Midwest Trucks                      Blake Brown--13.956 on 7-5-14<BR>\n\u2022 Outlaw Bandits                      George Sparkman--15.586 on 5-13-17<BR>\n\u2022 Hobby Stocks\t                      Travis Hancock--15.624 on 7-26-14<BR>\n\u2022 Big 8 Late Model Series             Tim Sargent--14.362 on 7-4-14<BR>\n\u2022 Legends\t                      Brady Fox-Rohde--15.362 on 5-13-17<BR>\n\u2022 Super Trucks                        Camden Murphy--13.787 on 5-16-15<BR>\n\u2022 Vores Compact Touring Series        Adam Kryzkowski--15.825 on 6-6-15<BR>\n\u2022 Midwest Bandoleros                  Alex Hartwig--17.741 on 7-13-19<BR>\n\u2022 600 Mod Lites                       John Griffin--14.998 on 7-11-15<BR>\n\u2022 Illini Racing Series Midgets        Ryan Probst--13.723 on 6-17-17<BR>\n\n==Notable weekly drivers==\n*[[Tim Schendel]], 2015 Super Late Model champion<ref>{{cite web|title=2015 Super Late Model points|url=http://www.dellsracewaypark.com/14_points_slm.asp|publisher=Dells Raceway Park|accessdate=November 2, 2015}}</ref>\n<!--\"Notable\" means there is a wikipedia article about the driver-->\n\n==Images==\n<gallery>\nFile:Dells Raceway Park Frontstretch 2015.jpg|Frontstretch\nFile:Dells Raceway Park Ticket Window 2015.jpg|Ticket window\nFile:Dells Raceway Park Building 2015.jpg|Main building\nFile:Dells Raceway Park Victory Lane.jpg|Victory Lane\n</gallery>\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n{{commonscat|Dells Raceway Park}}\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20071214004942/http://www.dellsracewaypark.com/modules/web/index.php/id/1 Dells Raceway Park website]\n*[http://www.racing-reference.info/tracks/Dells_Raceway_Park Dells Raceway Park race results] at Racing-Reference\n\n{{coord|43|40|34|N|89|50|43|W|region:US-WI|display=title}}\n\n{{NASCAR Elite Division Midwest racetracks}}\n\n[[Category:1958 establishments in Wisconsin]]\n[[Category:Sports venues completed in 1958]]\n[[Category:Buildings and structures in Juneau County, Wisconsin]]\n[[Category:Stock car racing]]\n[[Category:NASCAR tracks]]\n[[Category:Motorsport venues in Wisconsin]]\n[[Category:Tourist attractions in Juneau County, Wisconsin]]\n", "text_old": "{{Infobox motorsport venue\n|name             = Dells Raceway Park\n|nicknames        = \n|time             = \n|location         = N1070 Smith Rd., [[Wisconsin Dells, Wisconsin]] 53965 \n|coordinates      = \n|image            = [[File:Dells Raceway Park Panorama 2015 Falloween.jpg|center|250px|Panorama from turn 1 in 2015]]\n|image_caption    = Panorama from turn 1 in 2015\n|capacity         =\n|FIA_grade        =\n|owner            = Wayne Lensing\n|operator         =\n|broke_ground     = \n|opened           = 1958\n|closed           = \n|construction_cost= \n|architect        = \n|former_names     = Dells Motor Speedway\n|events           = Lyle Nabbefeldt Memorial, [[ARCA Midwest Tour]] Bill Meiller Memorial 101, Icebreaker 100, Falloween 150\n|miles_first      = true\n|layout1          = oval\n|surface          = asphalt\n|length_km        = 0.536\n|length_mi        = 0.333\n|turns            = 4\n|banking          = 9 degrees (corners), 6 degrees (straights)\n|record_time      = 13.108 seconds\n|record_driver    = [[Travis Sauter]]\n|record_team      = \n|record_year      = 2013\n|record_class     = Super Late Model\n|embedded         = <!--For embedding another infobox with such capability like {{tl|designation list}} and {{tl|infobox NRHP}}-->\n}}\n'''Dells Raceway Park''' (DRP), formerly known as the '''Dells Motor Speedway''', is a [[car racing]] [[Race track|raceway]] located in the town of [[Lyndon, Juneau County, Wisconsin|Lyndon]], in [[Juneau County, Wisconsin|Juneau County]], north of [[Wisconsin Dells, Wisconsin]] just off of [[U.S. Route 12]]/[[Wisconsin Highway 16]].

The second event was the Falloween 150, which was held in late October after all other late model events in the state of Wisconsin had concluded.\n\n==Track Records==\n\u2022 Super Late Model                    [[Ty Majeski]]--13.075 on 8-31-19<BR>\n\u2022 TUNDRA Super Late Model Series      Corey Jankowski--13.273 on 9-01-11<BR>\n\u2022 Late Model                          Rich Schumann, Jr.--13.925 on 5-7-16<BR>\n\u2022 Modifieds                           Jerry Blystone--14.293 on 8-31-19<BR> \n\u2022 Sportsmen                           Dave Trute--14.475 on 5-6-17<BR>\n\u2022 Mid-American Stock Car Series       Brian Back--14.361 on 7-24-10<BR>\n\u2022 Great Northern Sportsmen Series     Dave Trute--14.832 on 4-17-16<BR>\n\u2022 Midwest Dash Series                 George Sparkman--15.832 on 4-9-17<BR>\n\u2022 Pure Stock                          Mark Hohl--15.444 on 9-22-12<BR>\n\u2022 Super Stock                         Mike Lichtfeld--14.695 on 8-09-08<BR>\n\u2022 Bandit                              Abe Bires--16.215 on 8-26-17<BR>\n\u2022 Midwest Trucks                      Blake Brown--13.956 on 7-5-14<BR>\n\u2022 Outlaw Bandits                      George Sparkman--15.586 on 5-13-17<BR>\n\u2022 Hobby Stocks\t                      Travis Hancock--15.624 on 7-26-14<BR>\n\u2022 Big 8 Late Model Series             Tim Sargent--14.362 on 7-4-14<BR>\n\u2022 Legends\t                      Brady Fox-Rohde--15.362 on 5-13-17<BR>\n\u2022 Super Trucks                        Camden Murphy--13.787 on 5-16-15<BR>\n\u2022 Vores Compact Touring Series        Adam Kryzkowski--15.825 on 6-6-15<BR>\n\u2022 Midwest Bandoleros                  Alex Hartwig--17.741 on 7-13-19<BR>\n\u2022 600 Mod Lites                       John Griffin--14.998 on 7-11-15<BR>\n\u2022 Illini Racing Series Midgets        Ryan Probst--13.723 on 6-17-17<BR>\n\n==Notable weekly drivers==\n*[[Tim Schendel]], 2015 Super Late Model champion<ref>{{cite web|title=2015 Super Late Model points|url=http://www.dellsracewaypark.com/14_points_slm.asp|publisher=Dells Raceway Park|accessdate=November 2, 2015}}</ref>\n<!--\"Notable\" means there is a wikipedia article about the driver-->\n\n==Images==\n<gallery>\nFile:Dells Raceway Park Frontstretch 2015.jpg|Frontstretch\nFile:Dells Raceway Park Ticket Window 2015.jpg|Ticket window\nFile:Dells Raceway Park Building 2015.jpg|Main building\nFile:Dells Raceway Park Victory Lane.jpg|Victory Lane\n</gallery>\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n{{commonscat|Dells Raceway Park}}\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20071214004942/http://www.dellsracewaypark.com/modules/web/index.php/id/1 Dells Raceway Park website]\n\n{{coord|43|40|34|N|89|50|43|W|region:US-WI|display=title}}\n\n{{NASCAR Elite Division Midwest racetracks}}\n\n[[Category:1958 establishments in Wisconsin]]\n[[Category:Sports venues completed in 1958]]\n[[Category:Buildings and structures in Juneau County, Wisconsin]]\n[[Category:Stock car racing]]\n[[Category:Motorsport venues in Wisconsin]]\n[[Category:Tourist attractions in Juneau County, Wisconsin]]\n", "name_user": "Luks25", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eExternal links:Update", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dells_Raceway_Park"}

{"title_page": "St John Ambulance Ranks and Insignia", "text_new": "{{for|the ranks and insignia for St John Ambulance in places other than the United Kingdom|St John Ambulance}}\n{{Use dmy dates|date=January 2015}}\n{{more citations needed|date=September 2014}}\nFrom its beginnings, the '''[[St John Ambulance|St John Ambulance Brigade]]''' employed '''ranks and insignia''' to distinguish grades within its membership and management structure; these were extended across the wider organisation following its merge with the St John Ambulance Association to form St John Ambulance. Based upon the [[British Army officer rank insignia|British Army officer]] and the [[British Army Other Ranks rank insignia|British Army other ranks]] structure and insignia, the original ranks and insignia have been subject to several modifications over the history of the organisation.\n\nThe basic \"star\" or \"pip\" has at its centre the eight point [[Maltese Cross (symbol)|Maltese Cross]], the badge of the Order of St John. The [[Crown (headgear)|crown]] used is also that of the Order. At the higher general list ranks, crossed [[stretcher]]s are used rather than the crossed [[sword]] and [[Club (weapon)|baton]] of military use. Insignia are in silver, again symbolic of the [[Venerable Order of Saint John|Order of St. John]].\n\nAlso officers who hold rank within the organisation at or above R4 wear a cockade in their hat (women) and have a silver bar (men), however at or above R3 wear a cockade and tuft (women) and silver bar and Wort cap (men).\n\nSince the mid-1990s the former \"Senior NCO\" and \"Warrant Officer\" ranks have been abolished. These ranks, whose titles were \"Staff Sergeant\", \"Corps Sergeant Major\", and \"County (or District or Bailiwick) Sergeant Major\" were deemed too militaristic in form although a few previous incumbents remain. Their demise has gone hand in hand with a lowering of emphasis on parading and drill. The county Sergeant Major, if the county has appointed one, wears member rank slides and Warrant Officer Class 2 (St John Crown in laurel leaves) arm badges on the bottom of each arm.\n\nNurses used to wear Rhodium Metal bars on their Shoulder Straps. A red enamelled bar denoted a State Registered Nurse (SRN). \nA purple enamelled bar denoted a State Certified Midwive (SCM) and/or a Nurse on the Special Part of the State Register i.e. psychiatric or learning disability). A green enamelled bar denoted a State Enrolled Nurse (SEN). \nTheir used was abaondoned in the mid 1990s.\n\nIn 2012, one Warrant Officer Class 1 (wearing Royal Arms badges in silver on both arms) was appointed at National HQ to advise on ceremonial matters across St John Ambulance.\n\nIn December 2013, as a result of the rank review, a simplified rank structure was introduced, being fully implemented by the end of March 2014. The aim of the new rank structure is to ensure that rank is applied consistently throughout the organisation, and that it is applied only based on an individual's role. A number of ranks will cease to exist as a result of this change, and the requirements for many of the remaining ranks will change.<ref>Messinger, M. and Killen, S.

Persons who are undertaking an operational management role, but who do not have rank, will continue to not wear rank. Persons who do have rank, but who are not in an operational management role at the event should not display their rank.\n\n==National variations==\nWhilst this article uses English St John Ambulance practice as standard, inevitably national variations in rank structure have occurred as the organisation has spread to other countries, and subsequently developed in those countries with a degree of autonomy. The English types are presented in the illustrative tables below. Ranks in other countries are usually similar, but adopt local terminology such as (for example) \"Provincial Commissioner\" instead of \"County Commissioner\". There may also be fewer ranks in smaller countries, as a result of the need for fewer rungs of management structure.\n\n==Unique Rank Slide Specifications==\n\nIn 2013, St John Ambulance UK rolled out a new design of rank slide. While the insignia, colours and text font remain unchanged, the slides themselves are now much longer and wider, with insignia being much larger. This updated design for rank slides corresponds with the rise of the Service Delivery Uniform (SDU), rolled out in 2011. This is the first modification to the design of the rank slides since the change from cloth and thread to rubber-made rank slides with a new font for 'St John Ambulance' title on all slides.\n\nThis was later abandoned.\n\n== Role-Based Variations ==\n\nIn a similar fashion to the [[Police]], St John Ambulance used to have a number of role-based variations on the standard rank markings detailed below. For large-scale events where a [[Gold Silver Bronze command structure|Gold, Silver, Bronze command structure]] is used, the Silver and Bronze commanders used to wear white and orange rank slides respectively.\n\nThe organisation has a number of specially trained Medical Response Team volunteers who operate in dense crowds. The teams operate in units of 3 with a designated Supervisor, Clinical Lead and an Operator.  Overall command and control is maintained by a 'Bronze' officer.

Based upon the [[British Army officer rank insignia|British Army officer]] and the [[British Army Other Ranks rank insignia|British Army other ranks]] structure and insignia, the original ranks and insignia have been subject to several modifications over the history of the organisation.\n\nThe basic \"star\" or \"pip\" has at its centre the eight point [[Maltese Cross (symbol)|Maltese Cross]], the badge of the Order of St John. The [[Crown (headgear)|crown]] used is also that of the Order. At the higher general list ranks, crossed [[stretcher]]s are used rather than the crossed [[sword]] and [[Club (weapon)|baton]] of military use. Insignia are in silver, again symbolic of the [[Venerable Order of Saint John|Order of St. John]].\n\nAlso officers who hold rank within the organisation at or above R4 wear a cockade in their hat (women) and have a silver bar (men), however at or above R3 wear a cockade and tuft (women) and silver bar and Wort cap (men).\n\nSince the mid-1990s the former \"Senior NCO\" and \"Warrant Officer\" ranks have been abolished. These ranks, whose titles were \"Staff Sergeant\", \"Corps Sergeant Major\", and \"County (or District or Bailiwick) Sergeant Major\" were deemed too militaristic in form although a few previous incumbents remain. Their demise has gone hand in hand with a lowering of emphasis on parading and drill. The county Sergeant Major, if the county has appointed one, wears member rank slides and Warrant Officer Class 2 (St John Crown in laurel leaves) arm badges on the bottom of each arm. \n\n\nNurses used to wear Rhodium Metal bars on their Shoulder Straps. A red enamelled bar denoted a State Registered Nurse (SRN). \nA purple enamelled bar denoted a State Certified Midwive (SCM) and/or a Nurse on the Special Part of the State Register i.e. psychatric or learning disability). A green enamelled bar denoted a State Enrolled Nurse (SEN). \nTheir used was abaondoned in the mid 1990s. \n\nIn 2012, one Warrant Officer Class 1 (wearing Royal Arms badges in silver on both arms) was appointed at National HQ to advise on ceremonial matters across St John Ambulance.\n\nIn December 2013, as a result of the rank review, a simplified rank structure was introduced, being fully implemented by the end of March 2014. The aim of the new rank structure is to ensure that rank is applied consistently throughout the organisation, and that it is applied only based on an individual's role. A number of ranks will cease to exist as a result of this change, and the requirements for many of the remaining ranks will change.<ref>Messinger, M. and Killen, S.

Infill of the inner harbour began in the 1850's and accelerated with the arrival of the railroad resulting in the current day shape of downtown <ref>https://www.cgenarchive.org/toronto-lakeshores.html</ref>.  By 1858 the site was located between two warfs (Rees & Tinnings Warf). As land was expanded southward, it remained under Government control as possible locations of various Union Station expansions.  The majority of the land was still part of the lake up until the early 1900's. By 1925 The northern parcel of the property was turned into of Bayside Park, which had been part of an early proposal that was to have seen the lands south of the rail corridor transformed into an extensive lakeside park that followed today's Esplande. The remaining land was most likely under the control of Central Harbor Terminals<ref>https://maps.library.utoronto.ca/dvhmp/maps.html</ref>.\n\nIn the 1930s the property became the proposed home to [[Canada Post]]'s Toronto Postal Delivery Building.  In the 1920's a postal handling facility already existed in the east wing of the city's then New Union Station (Downtown Toronto's 3rd major train station)<ref>{{cite book |last=Filey |first=Mike |author-link= |date=1992 |title=A Toronto Album 2: More Glimpses of the City That Was|url=https://books.google.ca/books?id=K0tIsZ_TAIoC&pg=PA43 |location=Toronto |publisher=Dundurn Press |page=43 |isbn=}}</ref>.

Required modifications were made to the building to return it back to its postal delivery purposes as a result of alterations done by the Department of National Defence.  After the refurbishment work was completed in 1948, the building now possessed the capability and equipment for proper mail sorting and other mailing functions. Though it was designed as a mail sorting warehouse it was also the home of Postal Station \"A\" which served mostly institutional & commercial clients.  The Ground floor was where the mail was dropped off by both railway carts and postal vans. Unsorted mail was moved by conveyor belts to the top floor and via gravity fed mail chutes sorted by size & destination.  Eventually the sorted mail would end up back on the ground floor where it would be sent out for delivery<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://torontoplaques.com/Pages/Toronto_Postal_Delivery_Building.html|title=History|language=en|access-date=April 16, 2020</ref>.

The sculptors son Louis Temporale jr. helped with restoration efforts in 1998 and in 2016 was still critical of the lack of protection of the artwork by stadium ownership for over 20 years.

In a cost cutting move (part of larger overall service changes & cuts made to the Crown Corporation under the [[Brian Mulroney]] Conservatives), Canada Post decided to close the facility and move operations to an alternate more modern c.1970s letter processing faculty on nearby Eastern Avenue. A structure with easy access to highways was designed specificity for transport truck delivery of mail. By 1989, all of the old building's work was transferred here.<ref name=\":0\" />. The 1980s real estate boom saw the building site become surrounded by skyscrapers, hotels, convention centres, SkyDome stadium & condo towers.  In the early 1990s, real estate developers [[Bramalea (company)|Bramalea Ltd]] and [[Trizec Properties|Trizec]] arranged to purchase the building from Canada Post, and redevelop the site into a {{convert|230,000|m2|sqft|adj=on}} office, retail and residential space. Financial and development details of the purchase imposed various conditions prior to development, including rezoning by the city, remediation of soil contamination by Canada Post.<ref>{{cite news|title=Bramalea's Moves Shake Taxpayers|first=Stevie|last=Cameron|date=November 15, 1992|publisher=[[The Globe and Mail]]}}</ref>\n\nDue to financial difficulties, the building's ownership was returned to Canada Post in 1993 and remained abandoned.

In 1995, it had been decided that the NBA would expand into Canada. The Toronto Raptors were created and would need an indoor arena to play in. The Canada Post building was chosen to be the new home of the Raptors due to its downtown location and lot size. Other venues such as [[Exhibition Place]], North York Centre, Bay and Wellesley, and Bay and Dundas were also considered.

The building retained the [[Art Deco]] Queenston limestone facade of the Toronto Postal Delivery Building along the east (along [[Bay Street]]) and south ([[Lake Shore Boulevard]]) walls of that structure, but the rest of the building (facing [[Union Station (Toronto)|Union Station]]) was removed to make room for the arena, through the process of [[facadism]]. The original building is protected under the ''[[Ontario Heritage Act]]''.\n\n====Arena 'Wars'====\nWhen MLGL ([[Maple Leaf Sports and Entertainment|Maple Leaf Gardens, Limited]] at the time the controlling company of the Toronto Maple Leafs) lost out on their desire to be the franchise owners of the Raptors, competition between the two organizations heated up centred around venues. MLGL declined to allow Maple Leaf Gardens to be used for the NBA upstart as a result pushing Bitove to secure rights to have the Raptors' opening seasons played at SkyDome until construction of the new stadium to be complete.\n\nThe 1930s-era Maple Leaf Gardens was showing its age; the Maple Leafs in desperate desire for a new facility began developing plans for building an all-new stadium with one of the key criteria for the new location that it must be within close walking proximity to both the subway system and GO Transit. During the early stages of construction, MLGL floated to the media plans for their own plans to build a competing single-use stadium on adjacent property just to the north of the stadium atop the train sheds at Union Station (similar to how [[Madison Square Garden]] was constructed) as the new home for the Toronto Maple Leafs.<ref name=ArenaWars>{{cite news|title=Leafs ready to Move (Page 2)|first=Craig|last=Daniels|date=April 16, 1997|publisher=[[The Toronto Sun]]}}</ref> The reaction from Raptors was nothing but anger. \"This proposed (Maple Leaf) location really disturbs us\" stated team president Richard Peddie, who went on to say that they would fight the Leafs \"every step of the way\" and he didn't understand why the Leafs have refused to join with the Raptors at their site; claiming that the Leafs want to \"build virtually on top of us\".<ref name=\"ArenaWars\" /> The major problem of the Union Station proposal is the land that the stadium would be built on was actually City of Toronto land that was leased out to CN Rail and CP Rail, which were in a major, long-standing dispute over rent payments (dating back to 1969). As a result, MLGL offered the city $156 Million (1997 CAD) in cash & assets to settle any and all outstanding claims and to buy the air rights above the Union Station train platforms.\n\nDuring this period John Bitove who disputed over the future of the arena who as a result of a [[shotgun clause]] was forced to sell his stake to Allan Slaight (who wanted a joint arena deal with MLGL) and now with majority ownership immediately went into talks with MLGL which eventually purchased both the Raptors and their partially completed arena, which subsequently resulted in major modifications to the original design, which was basketball-specific, to make the arena become more suitable for hockey. Originally planned to cost $217&nbsp;million, MLGL increased the budget to $265&nbsp;million after taking control.<ref name=cost>{{cite news|title=Upgrades added to cost|first=David|last=Shoalts|date=February 17, 1999|publisher=[[The Globe and Mail]]}}</ref> The Raptors were twice fined a million dollars (which were donated to their charitable foundation) by the NBA for missing deadlines to begin construction of their new arena.<ref>{{cite news|title=Raptors' arena bites dust|last=Christe|first=James|date=May 16, 1997|publisher=[[The Globe and Mail]]}}</ref>\n\n====Construction==== \nAfter the purchase of the Raptors and the Air Canada Centre the new owners entered into a design-build contract with PCL with the commitment to finish the stadium in 24-months by March 1st 1999<ref>https://canada.constructconnect.com/dcn/news/projects/2017/03/pcl-construction-reflects-on-building-the-air-canada-centre-1022273w</ref>.

This boosted Toronto's economy and led to further construction in the downtown core. Many projects in the area were completed ahead of schedule as a result of a desire to increase the infrastructure of downtown Toronto, and also from private funding (approximately $13&nbsp;million) that was invested in seeing the economic growth of Toronto. These projects included the Bay West Teamway, Union Plaza, the Galleria (shopping centre), and Bremner Boulevard.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n[[Air Canada]] purchased [[naming rights]] to the arena for US$30&nbsp;million for 20 years.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/background/marketing/|work=CBC News|title=Branding for dollars|date=February 15, 2007}}</ref>\n\n==Current History== \n[[File:PATH Escalators Construction Scotiabank Arena.jpg|thumb|right|Escalators for a new [[PATH (Toronto)|PATH]] system connection to the under-construction [[CIBC Square]] office complex being installed in the arena's lobby in 2019]]\nIn 2003, MLSE completed a $5-million upgrade of the arena, including a new LED signage system.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://mapleleafs.nhl.com/club/news.htm?id=459588|title=Air Canada Centre Renovations to Improve Ultimate Fan Experience|date=September 9, 2003|accessdate=January 6, 2014|publisher=[[Toronto Maple Leafs]]}}</ref>  During the summer of 2015, a $10-million upgrade of the arena was carried out, which included the installation of a new scoreboard four times larger than the previous one.

By 1858 the site was located between two warfs (Rees & Tinnings Warf). As land was expanded southward, it remained under Government control as possible locations of various Union Station expansions.  The majority of the land was still part of the lake up until the early 1900's. By 1925 The northern parcel of the property was turned into of Bayside Park, which had been part of an early proposal that was to have seen the lands south of the rail corridor transformed into an extensive lakeside park that followed today's Esplande. The remaining land was most likely under the control of Central Harbor Terminals<ref>https://maps.library.utoronto.ca/dvhmp/maps.html</ref>.\n\nIn the 1930s the property became the proposed home to [[Canada Post]]'s Toronto Postal Delivery Building.  In the 1920's a postal handling facility already existed in the east wing of the city's then New Union Station (Downtown Toronto's 3rd major train station)<ref>{{cite book |last=Filey |first=Mike |author-link= |date=1992 |title=A Toronto Album 2: More Glimpses of the City That Was|url=https://books.google.ca/books?id=K0tIsZ_TAIoC&pg=PA43 |location=Toronto |publisher=Dundurn Press |page=43 |isbn=}}</ref>.

Modifications were made to the building to be more adequately equipped for postal delivery, after it was altered by the Department of National Defence.  After the refurbishment work was completed in 1948, the building now possessed the capability and equipment for proper mail sorting and other mailing functions. Though it was designed as a mail sorting warehouse it was also the home of Postal Station \"A\" which served mostly institutional & commercial clients.  The Ground floor was where the mail was dropped off by both railway carts and postal vans. Unsorted mail was moved by conveyor belts to the top floor and via gravity fed mail chutes sorted by size & destination.  Eventually the sorted mail would end up back on the ground floor where it would be sent out for delivery<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://torontoplaques.com/Pages/Toronto_Postal_Delivery_Building.html|title=History|language=en|access-date=April 16, 2020</ref>.

In a cost cutting move (part of larger overall service changes & cuts made to the Crown Corporation under the [[Brian Mulroney]] Conservatives), Canada Post decided to close the facility and move operations to an alternate more modern c.1970s letter processing faculty on nearby Eastern Avenue. A structure with easy access to highways was designed specificity for transport truck delivery of mail. By 1989, all of the old building's work was transferred here.<ref name=\":0\" />. The 1980s real estate boom saw the building site become surrounded by skyscrapers, hotels, convention centres, SkyDome stadium & condo towers.  In the early 1990s, real estate developers [[Bramalea (company)|Bramalea Ltd]] and [[Trizec Properties|Trizec]] arranged to purchase the building from Canada Post, and redevelop the site into a {{convert|230,000|m2|sqft|adj=on}} office, retail and residential space. Financial and development details of the purchase imposed various conditions prior to development, including rezoning by the city, remediation of soil contamination by Canada Post.<ref>{{cite news|title=Bramalea's Moves Shake Taxpayers|first=Stevie|last=Cameron|date=November 15, 1992|publisher=[[The Globe and Mail]]}}</ref>\n\nDue to financial difficulties, the building's ownership was returned to Canada Post in 1993 and remained abandoned.

In 1995, it had been decided that the NBA would expand into Canada. The Toronto Raptors were created and would need an indoor arena to play in. The Canada Post building was chosen to be the new home of the Raptors due to its downtown location and lot size. Other venues such as [[Exhibition Place]], North York Centre, Bay and Wellesley, and Bay and Dundas were also considered.

The building retained the [[Art Deco]] Queenston limestone facade of the Toronto Postal Delivery Building along the east (along [[Bay Street]]) and south ([[Lake Shore Boulevard]]) walls of that structure, but the rest of the building (facing [[Union Station (Toronto)|Union Station]]) was removed to make room for the arena, through the process of [[facadism]]. The original building is protected under the ''[[Ontario Heritage Act]]''.\n\n====Arena 'Wars'====\nWhen MLGL ([[Maple Leaf Sports and Entertainment|Maple Leaf Gardens, Limited]] at the time the controlling company of the Toronto Maple Leafs) lost out on their desire to be the franchise owners of the Raptors, competition between the two organizations heated up centred around venues. MLGL declined to allow Maple Leaf Gardens to be used for the NBA upstart as a result pushing Bitove to secure rights to have the Raptors' opening seasons played at SkyDome until construction of the new stadium to be complete.\n\nThe 1930s-era Maple Leaf Gardens was showing its age; the Maple Leafs in desperate desire for a new facility began developing plans for building an all-new stadium with one of the key criteria for the new location that it must be within close walking proximity to both the subway system and GO Transit. During the early stages of construction, MLGL floated to the media plans for their own plans to build a competing single-use stadium on adjacent property just to the north of the stadium atop the train sheds at Union Station (similar to how [[Madison Square Garden]] was constructed) as the new home for the Toronto Maple Leafs.<ref name=ArenaWars>{{cite news|title=Leafs ready to Move (Page 2)|first=Craig|last=Daniels|date=April 16, 1997|publisher=[[The Toronto Sun]]}}</ref> The reaction from Raptors was nothing but anger. \"This proposed (Maple Leaf) location really disturbs us\" stated team president Richard Peddie, who went on to say that they would fight the Leafs \"every step of the way\" and he didn't understand why the Leafs have refused to join with the Raptors at their site; claiming that the Leafs want to \"build virtually on top of us\".<ref name=\"ArenaWars\" /> The major problem of the Union Station proposal is the land that the stadium would be built on was actually City of Toronto land that was leased out to CN Rail and CP Rail, which were in a major, long-standing dispute over rent payments (dating back to 1969). As a result, MLGL offered the city $156 Million (1997 CAD) in cash & assets to settle any and all outstanding claims and to buy the air rights above the Union Station train platforms.\n\nDuring this period John Bitove who disputed over the future of the arena who as a result of a [[shotgun clause]] was forced to sell his stake to Allan Slaight (who wanted a joint arena deal with MLGL) and now with majority ownership immediately went into talks with MLGL which eventually purchased both the Raptors and their partially completed arena, which subsequently resulted in major modifications to the original design, which was basketball-specific, to make the arena become more suitable for hockey. Originally planned to cost $217&nbsp;million, MLGL increased the budget to $265&nbsp;million after taking control.<ref name=cost>{{cite news|title=Upgrades added to cost|first=David|last=Shoalts|date=February 17, 1999|publisher=[[The Globe and Mail]]}}</ref> The Raptors were twice fined a million dollars (which were donated to their charitable foundation) by the NBA for missing deadlines to begin construction of their new arena.<ref>{{cite news|title=Raptors' arena bites dust|last=Christe|first=James|date=May 16, 1997|publisher=[[The Globe and Mail]]}}</ref>\n\n====Construction==== \nAfter the purchase of the Raptors and the Air Canada Centre the new owners entered into a design-build contract with PCL with the commitment to finish the stadium in 24-months by March 1st 1999<ref>https://canada.constructconnect.com/dcn/news/projects/2017/03/pcl-construction-reflects-on-building-the-air-canada-centre-1022273w</ref>.

The Raptors had attempted to play the April 19 match at Maple Leaf Gardens, but were unsuccessful.<ref>{{cite news|title=Raptors Move Final Game to Hamilton|date=January 7, 1998|publisher=[[Associated Press]]|url=https://www.apnews.com/7027ff09054e45b3b7471205f12cb521}}</ref>\n[[File:Air Canada Centre in 1999.jpg|thumb|right|Air Canada Centre in July 1999, five months after the arena opened]]\n\nOn December 30th 1998, the building's construction was completed, 9 days ahead of schedule.

This boosted Toronto's economy and led to further construction in the downtown core. Many projects in the area were completed ahead of schedule as a result of a desire to increase the infrastructure of downtown Toronto, and also from private funding (approximately $13&nbsp;million) that was invested in seeing the economic growth of Toronto.

Apart from the regular-sized Nintendo 3DS, the '''Nintendo 3DS XL''' is a larger model of the console which was released on July 28, 2012, and features 90% larger screens than the original Nintendo 3DS.<ref name=\"3DS XL release\" /> The '''Nintendo 2DS''' is a complete redesign of the handheld which was released on October 12, 2013, and is described as an \"entry level\" version of the 3DS. This console, while still capable of playing Nintendo DS and 3DS games, removes the 3D functionality and changes the form factor to a fixed, \"slate\" design.<ref name=\"2ds\" /> The '''New Nintendo 3DS''', which also has an XL variant, adds additional controls and improved functionality, and is able to play certain games not compatible with previous models. A cheaper alternative, the '''New Nintendo 2DS XL''', incorporates some of the features from the New Nintendo 3DS with elements from the 2DS such as the lack of stereoscopic 3D functionality; it also shifts from the slate form factor of the original 2DS model to a clamshell design.\n\n==== Nintendo 2DS ====\n{{Main|Nintendo 2DS}}\n[[File:Nintendo-2DS-angle.jpg|thumb|A ''Black + Blue'' Nintendo 2DS]]\nThe '''Nintendo 2DS''' (abbreviated to '''2DS''') was announced on August 28, 2013, as a new entry-level model of the [[Nintendo 3DS family]]. While its hardware and software are relatively similar to the Nintendo 3DS (and still offers compatibility with Nintendo DS and 3DS games), it lacks the 3DS's signature 3D screen, does not have internal stereo speakers (only using a [[monaural|mono]] speaker), and uses a slate-like form factor as opposed to the [[clamshell design]] used by its Nintendo DS and 3DS predecessors. The Nintendo 2DS was released in North America and Europe on October 12, 2013, coinciding with the launch of [[Pok\u00e9mon X and Y|''Pok\u00e9mon X'' & ''Y'']] and is being sold alongside the Nintendo 3DS and 3DS XL at a relatively lower price point.<ref name=ign-announce-2ds/>\n\nAs a cheaper model of the Nintendo 3DS family that still plays Nintendo DS and 3DS games, the Nintendo 2DS is seen as a market strategy to broaden the overall Nintendo handheld gaming market. As such, the 2DS is a handheld console targeted at a different audience than that of the regular Nintendo 3DS models, particularly younger users.

The [[Famicom 3D System]], an accessory consisting of [[liquid crystal]] [[Active shutter 3D system|shutter glasses]], was Nintendo's first product that enabled stereoscopic 3D effects. Although very few titles were released, Nintendo helped design one\u2014called ''[[Famicom Grand Prix II: 3D Hot Rally]]''\u2014which was co-developed by Nintendo and HAL Laboratory and released in 1988. The Famicom 3D System failed to garner market interest and was never released outside Japan.<ref name=\"Famicom 3D\">{{cite web |url=http://kotaku.com/5527760/nintendos-first-3d-technology-shot-a-spaceship-at-marios-face |title=Nintendo's First 3D Technology Shot A Spaceship At Mario's Face |publisher=Kotaku |date=April 30, 2010 |accessdate= November 27, 2012}}</ref><ref name=\"Iwata 3DS interview\">{{cite web |url=http://iwataasks.nintendo.com/interviews/#/3ds/how-nintendo-3ds-made/0/0 |title=Volume 1: And That's How the Nintendo 3DS Was Made |date=January 7, 2011 |accessdate=November 27, 2012}}</ref>\n\nDespite the limited success, Nintendo would press ahead with 3D development into the 1990s. [[Gunpei Yokoi]], creator of the [[Game Boy]] handheld console and popular ''[[Metroid]]'' video game, developed a new 3D device for Nintendo called the [[Virtual Boy]].

With an [[Liquid crystal display|LCD]] attachment, it could display true stereoscopic 3D, though only the launch title ''[[Luigi's Mansion]]'' was ever designed to utilize it. Due to the expensive nature of the requisite peripheral technology at the time, the GameCube's 3D functionality was never marketed to the public. Nintendo later experimented with a 3D LCD during development of the [[Game Boy Advance SP]], but the idea was shelved after it failed to achieve satisfactory results.

Apart from the regular-sized Nintendo 3DS, the '''Nintendo 3DS XL''' is a larger model of the console which was released on July 28, 2012, and features 90% larger screens than the original Nintendo 3DS.<ref name=\"3DS XL release\" /> The '''Nintendo 2DS''' is a complete redesign of the handheld which was released on October 12, 2013, and is described as an \"entry level\" version of the 3DS. This console, while still capable of playing Nintendo DS and 3DS games, removes the 3D functionality and changes the form factor to a fixed, \"slate\" design.<ref name=\"2ds\" /> The '''New Nintendo 3DS''', which also has an XL variant, adds additional controls and improved functionality, and is able to play certain games not compatible with previous models. A cheaper alternative, the '''New Nintendo 2DS XL''', incorporates some of the features from the New Nintendo 3DS with elements from the 2DS such as the lack of stereoscopic 3D functionality; it also shifts from the slate form factor of the original 2DS model to a clamshell design.\n\n==== Nintendo 2DS ====\n{{Main|Nintendo 2DS}}\n[[File:Nintendo-2DS-angle.jpg|thumb|A ''Black + Blue'' Nintendo 2DS]]\nThe '''Nintendo 2DS''' (abbreviated to '''2DS''') was announced on August 28, 2013, as a new entry-level model of the [[Nintendo 3DS family]]. While its hardware and software are relatively similar to the Nintendo 3DS (and still offers compatibility with Nintendo DS and 3DS games), it lacks the 3DS's signature 3D screen, does not have internal stereo speakers (only using a [[monaural|mono]] speaker), and uses a slate-like form factor as opposed to the [[clamshell design]] used by its Nintendo DS and 3DS predecessors. The Nintendo 2DS was released in North America and Europe on October 12, 2013, coinciding with the launch of [[Pok\u00e9mon X and Y|''Pok\u00e9mon X'' & ''Y'']] and is being sold alongside the Nintendo 3DS and 3DS XL at a relatively lower price point.<ref name=ign-announce-2ds/>\n\nAs a cheaper model of the Nintendo 3DS family that still plays Nintendo DS and 3DS games, the Nintendo 2DS is seen as a market strategy to broaden the overall Nintendo handheld gaming market. As such, the 2DS is a handheld console targeted at a different audience than that of the regular Nintendo 3DS models, particularly younger users.
