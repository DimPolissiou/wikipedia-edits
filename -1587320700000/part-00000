Needing a more expressive font format to handle fine typography and the complex behavior of many of the world's writing systems, the two companies combined the underlying technologies of both formats and added new extensions intended to address those formats' limitations. The name OpenType was chosen for the combined technologies, and the technology was announced later that year.\n\n===Open Font Format===\nAdobe and Microsoft continued to develop and refine OpenType over the next decade.

By 2006, every major [[Type foundry|font foundry]] and many minor ones were developing fonts in OpenType format.{{Citation needed|date=July 2011|reason=uncited statistics}}\n\n===Unicode Variation Sequences===\nUnicode version 3.2 (published in 2002) introduced [[Variant form (Unicode)|variation selectors]] as an encoding mechanism to represent particular glyph forms for characters.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.unicode.org/reports/tr28/tr28-3.html |title=Unicode Standard Annex #28, Unicode 3.2 |website=www.unicode.org |date=2002-03-27 |accessdate=2017-04-22}}</ref> Unicode did not, however, specify how text-display implementations should support these sequences.

This resulted in development of cmap subtable Format 14, which was introduced in OpenType version 1.5.<ref name=\"OpenTypeChangeLog\">{{cite web |url=https://www.microsoft.com/typography/otspec/changes.htm |title=OpenType specification change log |website=www.microsoft.com |date= |accessdate=2017-04-22}}</ref>\n\n===Color fonts===\n\nUnicode version 6.0 introduced [[emoji]] encoded as characters into Unicode.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.unicode.org/versions/Unicode6.0.0/ |title=Unicode\u00ae 6.0.0 |website=www.unicode.org |date=2010-10-11 |accessdate=April 22, 2017}}</ref> Several companies quickly acted to add support for Unicode emoji in their products. Since Unicode emoji are handled as text, and since color is an essential aspect of the emoji experience, this led to a need to create mechanisms for displaying multicolor glyphs.\n\nApple, Google and Microsoft independently developed different color-font solutions for use in OS X/iOS, Android and Windows. OpenType / OFF already had support for monochrome bitmap glyph, and so Google proposed that OFF be extended to allow for color bitmaps. This was the approach being taken by Apple, though Apple declined to participate in extending the ISO standard. As a result, Apple added the 'sbix' table to their TrueType format in OS X 10.7,<ref>{{cite web |url=https://developer.apple.com/fonts/TrueType-Reference-Manual/RM06/Chap6sbix.html |title=The 'sbix' table |website=developer.apple.com |date= |accessdate=April 22, 2017}}</ref> while Google proposed addition of the CBDT and CBLC tables to OFF.\n\nMicrosoft adopted a different approach than color bitmaps. Noting existing practice on the Web of layering glyphs of different color on top of one another to create multi-colored elements such as icons, Microsoft proposed a new COLR table to map a glyph into a set of glyphs that are layered, and a CPAL table to define the colors.\n\nAdobe proposed yet another approach: add a new 'SVG ' table that can contain multi-color glyphs represented using [[Scalable Vector Graphics]].\n\nThe Adobe, Microsoft and Google proposals were all incorporated into the third edition of OFF (ISO/IEC 14496-22:2015).<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.iso.org/standard/66391.html |title=ISO/IEC 14496-22:2015 Information technology -- Coding of audio-visual objects -- Part 22: Open Font Format |website= |date=October 2015 |accessdate=2017-04-22}}</ref> The new tables\u2014CBDT, CBLC, COLR, CPAL, SVG\u2014were added to OpenType version 1.7.<ref name=\"OpenTypeChangeLog\"/>\n\nWhile Microsoft originally supported only the COLR/CPAL color format, support for all of the different color formats, including Apple's 'sbix' format, was added to [[Microsoft Windows]] in the Windows 10 Anniversary Update.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/hh802480(v=vs.85).aspx#what_s_new_for_windows_10_anniversary_update |title=What's new in DirectWrite |website=msdn.microsoft.com |date= |accessdate=2017-04-22}}</ref> The 'sbix' table was subsequently added to OpenType in version 1.8.<ref name=\"OpenTypeChangeLog\"/>\n\n===OpenType Collections===\n\nSince at least version 1.4, the OpenType specification had supported \u201cTrueType Collections\u201d, a feature of the format that allows multiple fonts to be stored in a single file. By combining related fonts into a single file, font tables that are identical can be shared, thereby allowing for more efficient storage. Also, individual fonts have a glyph-count limit of 65,535 glyphs, and a Collection file provides a mechanism for overcoming this limit in a single font file. (Each font within the collection still has the 65,535 limit, however.)\n\nA TrueType Collection file would typically have a file extension of \u201c.ttc\u201d.\n\nHowever, the specification only described collection files being used in conjunction with glyphs that are represented as TrueType outlines or as bitmaps. The potential existed to provide the same storage and glyph-count benefits to fonts that use CFF-format glyphs (.otf extension). But the specification did not explicitly allow for that.\n\nIn 2014, Adobe announced the creation of OpenType Collections (OTCs), a Collection font file that combines fonts that use CFF-format glyphs.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://blogs.adobe.com/CCJKType/2014/01/otc.html |title=Introducing & Building OpenType Collections (OTCs) |website=Blogs.adobe.com |date=2014-01-27 |accessdate=2017-01-19}}</ref> This provided significant storage benefits for [[CJK characters|CJK]] fonts that Adobe and Google were jointly developing. For example, the [[Noto fonts]] CJK OTC is ~10 MB smaller than the sum of the four separate OTFs of which it is composed.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.google.com/get/noto/help/cjk/ |title=Noto Sans CJK \u2013 Google Noto Fonts |website=Google.com |date= |accessdate=2017-01-19}}</ref> The use of a Collection also allowed for combining a very large number of glyphs into a single file, as would be needed for a pan-CJK font.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://lwn.net/Articles/613284/ |title=Google and Adobe's pan-CJK open font |website=Lwn.net |date= |accessdate=2017-01-19}}</ref>\n\nExplicit support for Collections with CFF-format glyphs was incorporated into the OpenType specification in version 1.8.<ref name=\"OpenTypeChangeLog\"/> To reflect this more-inclusive applicability, the term \u201cOpenType Collection\u201d was adopted, superseding \u201cTrueType Collection\u201d.\n\n=== OpenType Font Variations ===\n{{See also|Variable fonts}}\nOn September 14, 2016, Microsoft announced the release of OpenType version 1.8. This announcement was made together with Adobe, Apple, and Google at the [[ATypI]] conference in Warsaw.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-vdFRtcZU0 |title=Special OpenType Session |date=2016-09-14 |accessdate=2017-04-22}}</ref> OpenType version 1.8 introduced \u201cOpenType Font Variations\u201d, which adds mechanisms that allow a single font to support many design variations.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://medium.com/@tiro/https-medium-com-tiro-introducing-opentype-variable-fonts-12ba6cd2369 |title=Introducing OpenType Variable Fonts |author=John Hudson |date= |accessdate=2017-04-22}}</ref> Fonts that use these mechanisms are commonly referred to as \u201cOpenType variable fonts\u201d.\n\nOpenType Font Variations re-introduces techniques that were previously developed by Apple in [[Apple Advanced Typography|TrueType GX]], and by Adobe in [[Multiple master fonts|Multiple Master fonts]]. The common idea of these formats is that a single font includes data to describe multiple variations of a glyph outline (sometimes referred to as \u201cmasters\u201d), and that at text-display time, the font rasterizer is able to interpolate or \u201cblend\u201d these variations to derive a continuous range of additional outline variations.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.microsoft.com/typography/otspec/otvaroverview.htm |title=OpenType Font Variations Overview |website=www.microsoft.com |date= |accessdate=2017-04-22}}</ref>\n\nThe concept of fully parametric fonts had been explored in a more general way by [[Donald Knuth|Donald E. Knuth]] in the [[Metafont|METAFONT]] system, introduced in 1978.<ref>Knuth, Donald E. Mathematical typography. Bull. Amer. Math. Soc. (N.S.) 1 (1979), no. 2, 337--372.https://projecteuclid.org/euclid.bams/1183544082</ref> That system and its successors were never widely adopted by professional type designers or commercial software systems.<ref>CSTUG, Charles University, Prague, March 1996, Questions and Answers with Prof. Donald E.

Available online at http://www.tug.org/TUGboat/Articles/tb17-4/tb53knuc.pdf''</ref> TrueType GX and Multiple Master formats, OpenType Font Variations\u2019 direct predecessors, were introduced in the 1990s, but were not widely adopted, either. Adobe later abandoned support for the Multiple Master format.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://blog.typekit.com/2014/07/30/the-adobe-originals-silver-anniversary-story-how-the-originals-endured-in-an-ever-changing-industry/ |title=The Adobe Originals Silver Anniversary Story: How the Originals endured in an ever-changing industry |author=Tamye Riggs |date=2014-07-30 |access-date=2017-04-22}}</ref> This has led to questions as to whether a re-introduction of similar technology could succeed. By 2016, however, the industry landscape had changed in several respects. In particular, emergence of Web fonts and of mobile devices had created interest in [[Responsive web design|responsive design]] and in seeking ways to deliver more type variants in a size-efficient format. Also, whereas the 1990s was an era of aggressive competition in font technology, often referred to as \u201cthe font wars\u201d, OpenType Font Variations was developed in a collaborative manner involving several major vendors.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.pastemagazine.com/articles/2017/01/the-font-wars.html |title=The Font Wars |author=David Lemon |date=2017-01-27 |access-date=2017-04-22}}</ref>\n\nFont Variations is integrated into OpenType 1.8 in a comprehensive manner, allowing most previously-existing capabilities to be used in combination with variations. In particular, variations are supported for both TrueType or CFF glyph outlines, for TrueType hinting, and also for the OpenType Layout mechanisms. The only parts of OpenType for which variations are not supported but might potentially be useful are the SVG table for color glyphs, and the MATH table for layout of mathematical formulas. OpenType 1.8 made use of tables originally defined by Apple for TrueType GX (the avar, cvar, fvar and gvar tables). It also introduced several new tables, including a new table for version 2 of the CFF format (CFF2), and other new tables or additions to existing tables to integrate variations into other parts of the font format (the HVAR, MVAR, STAT and VVAR tables; additions to the BASE, GDEF and name tables).<ref name=\"OpenTypeChangeLog\"/>\n\n==Description==\n<gallery style=\"float:right;\">\nFile:Circle and quadratic bezier.svg|TrueType outlines use quadratic [[B\u00e9zier curve]]s.\nFile:Circle and cubic bezier.svg|CFF outlines use cubic B\u00e9zier curves.\n</gallery>\nOpenType uses the general [[sfnt]] structure of a TrueType font, but it adds several smartfont options that enhance the font's typographic and language support capabilities.\n\nThe [[glyph]] [[outline font|outline data]] in an OpenType font may be in one of two formats: either TrueType format outlines in a 'glyf' table, or [[Compact Font Format]] (CFF) outlines in a 'CFF&nbsp;' table. (The table name 'CFF&nbsp;' is four characters long, ending in a space character.) CFF outline data is based on the [[PostScript]] language Type 2 font format. However, the OpenType specification does not support the use of PostScript outlines in a TrueType Collection font file.\n\nFor many purposes, such as layout, it doesn't matter what the outline data format is, but for some purposes, such as [[rasterisation]], it is significant.  The OpenType standard does not specify the outline data format: rather, it accommodates any of several existing standards.  Sometimes terms like \"OpenType (PostScript flavor)\" (= \"Type 1 OpenType\", \"OpenType CFF\") or \"OpenType (TrueType flavor)\" are used to indicate which outline format a particular OpenType font file contains.\n\nOpenType has several distinctive characteristics:\n* Accommodates the [[Unicode]] [[character encoding]] (as well as others), so that it can support any writing script (or multiple scripts at once).\n* Accommodates up to 65,536 glyphs.\n* Advanced typographic \"layout\" features which prescribe positioning and replacement of rendered glyphs.  Replacement features include [[Typographic ligature|ligature]]s; positioning features include [[kerning]], mark placement, and [[Baseline (typography)|baseline]] specification.\n* Cross-platform font files, which can be used without modification on Mac OS, Microsoft Windows and Unix/Linux systems.\n* If no additional glyphs or extensive typographic features are added, OpenType CFF fonts can be considerably smaller than their Type 1 counterparts.\n\n==Comparison to other formats==\n{{unreferenced section|date=May 2013}}\nCompared with [[Apple Computer]]\u2019s \"GX Typography\"\u2014now called [[Apple Advanced Typography]] (AAT)\u2014and with the [[SIL International|SIL]]\u2019s [[Graphite (SIL)|Graphite]] technology, OpenType is less flexible in typographic options, but superior in language-related options and support.{{Clarify|date=February 2009}} Nevertheless, OpenType has been adopted much more widely than AAT or Graphite, despite AAT being the older technology.\n\nFrom a font developer's perspective, OpenType is, for many common situations, easier to develop for than AAT or Graphite. First, the simple declarative substitutions and positioning of OpenType are more readily understood than AAT's more complex state tables or the Graphite description language that resembles [[C syntax]]. Second, Adobe's strategy of licensing at no charge the [[source code]] developed for its own font development, AFDKO (Adobe Font Development Kit for OpenType), allowed third-party font editing applications such as [[FontLab]] and FontMaster to add support with relative ease. Although Adobe's text-driven coding support is not as visual as Microsoft's separate tool, VOLT (Visual OpenType Layout Tool), the integration with the tools being used to make the fonts has been well received.\n\nAnother difference is that an OpenType support framework (such as Microsoft's [[Uniscribe]]) needs to provide a fair bit of knowledge about special language processing issues to handle certain languages (e.g. Arabic). With AAT or Graphite, the font developer has to encapsulate all that expertise in the font. This means that AAT and Graphite can handle any arbitrary language, but that it requires more work and expertise from the font developers. On the other hand, OpenType fonts are easier to make, but can only support [[complex text layout]] if the application or operating system knows how to handle them.\n\nPrior to supporting OpenType, Adobe promoted [[multiple master fonts]] and [[expert fonts]] for high-end typography. Multiple master fonts were essentially an earlier (and less flexible) version of OpenType variable fonts, but lacked the controls for alternate glyphs and languages provided by OpenType. Expert fonts were a workaround for alternate glyphs, provided instead as separate supplementary fonts, such that certain special characters that had no place in the [[Adobe Standard Encoding]] character set\u2014ligatures, fractions, small capitals, etc.\u2014were placed in the expert font instead. Usage in applications was tricky, with, for example, typing a ''Z'' causing the ''ffl'' ligature to be generated. In modern OpenType fonts alternate glyphs are referenced by their relationship to the default glyph or glyphs (i.e. under what circumstances that glyph should be used) for the particular Unicode codepoint(s).\n\n==OpenType support==\n\n===Basic Roman support===\nOpenType support may be divided into several categories.{{Citation needed|date=March 2009}} Virtually all applications and most modern operating systems have basic Roman support and work with OpenType fonts just as well as other, older formats. Benefits beyond basic Roman support include extended language support through [[Unicode]], support for complex writing scripts such as [[Arabic language|Arabic]] and the [[Indo-Aryan languages|Indic languages]], and advanced typographic support for [[Latin alphabet|Latin script]] languages such as [[English language|English]].\n\nAmongst Microsoft's operating systems, OpenType TT fonts (.TTF) are backward compatible and therefore supported by all [[Microsoft Windows]] versions starting with Microsoft Windows 3.1. OpenType PS fonts (.OTF) are supported in all Windows versions starting with  Microsoft [[Windows 2000]]; [[Adobe Type Manager]] is required to be installed on Microsoft Windows 95/98/NT/Me for basic Roman support (only) of OpenType PS fonts.\n\n===Extended language support===\nExtended language support via Unicode for both OpenType and TrueType is present in most applications for Microsoft Windows {{Citation needed|date=June 2016}} (including [[Microsoft Office Publisher]], most Adobe applications, and Microsoft Office 2003, though not Word 2002), CorelDRAW X3 and newer, and many Mac OS X applications, including Apple's own such as [[TextEdit]], [[Pages (iWork)|Pages]] and [[Keynote (presentation creation software)|Keynote]]. It is also widely supported in free operating systems, such as Linux (e.g. in multiplatform applications like [[AbiWord]], [[Gnumeric]], [[Calligra Suite]], [[Scribus]], [[OpenOffice.org]] 3.2 and later versions,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://qa.openoffice.org/issues/show_bug.cgi?id=78858 |title=OpenOffice Supports OpenType Fonts ... |accessdate=2011-02-03}}</ref> etc.).\n\nOpenType support for [[complex script|complex written scripts]] has so far mainly appeared in Microsoft applications in [[Microsoft Office]], such as [[Microsoft Word]] and [[Microsoft Publisher]]. [[Adobe InDesign]] provides extensive OpenType capability in [[Japanese language|Japanese]] but does not directly support Middle Eastern or [[Brahmic family|Indic scripts]]\u2014though a separate version of InDesign is available that supports Middle Eastern scripts such as Arabic and Hebrew. Undocumented functionality in many Adobe Creative Suite 4 applications, including InDesign, Photoshop and Illustrator, enables Middle Eastern, Indic and other languages, but is not officially supported by Adobe, and requires third-party plug-ins to provide a user interface for the features.\n\n===Advanced typography===\nAdvanced typographic support for Latin script languages first appeared in Adobe applications such as [[Adobe InDesign]], [[Adobe Photoshop]] and [[Adobe Illustrator]]. [[QuarkXPress]] 6.5 and below were not Unicode compliant. Hence text in these versions of QuarkXPress that contains anything other than [[Code page#Windows (ANSI) code pages|WinANSI]]/[[Mac OS Roman|MacRoman]] characters will not display correctly in an OpenType font (nor in other Unicode font formats, for that matter). However, in QuarkXPress 7, Quark offered support similar to Adobe's. Corel's [[CorelDRAW]] introduced support for OpenType typographic features in version X6. [[Mellel]], a Mac OS X-only word processor from Redlers, claims parity in typographic features with InDesign, but also extends the support to right-to-left scripts; so does the [[Classical Text Editor]], a specialized word processor developed at the Austrian Academy of Sciences.\n\n{{As of|2009}}, popular word processors for Microsoft Windows did not support advanced OpenType typography features. Advanced typography features are implemented only in high-end [[desktop publishing]] software. The text engine from [[Windows Presentation Foundation]], which is a [[managed code]] implementation of OpenType, is the first Microsoft Windows [[Application Programming Interface|API]] to expose OpenType features to software developers, supporting both OpenType TrueType, and OpenType CFF ([[Compact Font Format]]) fonts. It supports advanced typographic features such as [[Typographical ligature|ligatures]], [[Text figures|old-style numerals]], [[swash (typography)|swash]] variants, [[fraction (mathematics)|fractions]], [[superscript]] and [[subscript]], [[small caps|small capitalization]], [[Font substitution|glyph substitution]], multiple [[baseline (typography)|baselines]], contextual and [[stylistic alternate]] character forms, kerning, line-level [[justification (typesetting)|justification]], [[ruby character]]s etc.<ref name=\"Sysm\u00e4l\u00e4inen\">{{cite web|last1=Sysm\u00e4l\u00e4inen|first1=Julia|title=Some Open Thoughts About OpenType|url=http://www.alphabettes.org/some-open-thoughts-about-opentype/|website=Alphabettes|accessdate=15 May 2016}}</ref> WPF applications automatically gain support for advanced typography features.

Apple's support for OpenType in Mac OS X 10.4 included most advanced typographic features necessary for [[Latin script]] languages, such as [[small caps]], [[oldstyle figures]], and various sorts of ligatures, but it did not yet support contextual alternates, positional forms, nor glyph reordering as handled by Microsoft's Uniscribe library on Windows. Thus, Mac OS X 10.4 did not offer support for Arabic or Indic scripts via OpenType (though such scripts are fully supported by existing AAT fonts). [[Mac OS X 10.5]] has improved support for OpenType and supports Arabic OpenType fonts. Gradually, the OpenType typography support has improved on newer Mac OS X versions (e.g. Mac OS X 10.10 can handle much better long contextual glyph substitutions).\n\nBitstream [[Panorama (Layout Engine)|Panorama]], a line layout and text composition engine from [[Bitstream Inc.]], provides complete OpenType support for compact and standard Asian fonts, Arabic, Hebrew, Indic, Thai and over 50 other worldwide languages. The application supports key OpenType tables required for line layout, such as BASE, glyph definition (GDEF), glyph positioning (GPOS), and glyph substitution (GSUB). Panorama also offers complete support for advanced typography features, such as ligatures, swashes, small caps, ornaments, ordinals, superiors, old style, kerning, fractions, etc.\n\nIn [[free software]] environments such as [[Linux]], OpenType rendering is provided by the [[FreeType]] project, included in free implementations of the [[X Window System]] such as [[X.Org Server|X.org]]. Complex text handling is provided either by [[pango]] (calling [[HarfBuzz]]) or [[Qt (toolkit)|Qt]]. The [[XeTeX]] and [[LuaTeX]] systems allow [[TeX]] documents to use OpenType fonts, along with most of their typographic features. Linux version of [[LibreOffice]] 4.1 and newer supports many OpenType typography features, because it began to use more sophisticated HarfBuzz text shaping library.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://wiki.documentfoundation.org/ReleaseNotes/4.1#Core/ |title=LibreOffice 4.1 ReleaseNotes |date= |accessdate= 2015-04-15}}</ref>\n\n==OpenType Feature File==\nAs a step in the creation of a font, OpenType font properties (other than the outline) can be defined using human-readable text saved in Adobe's OpenType Feature File format.<ref>Christopher Slye \u2013 OpenType feature files, ATypI 2006 [http://blogs.adobe.com/typblography/atypi2006/slye_lisbon-05.pdf slides]</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://adobe-type-tools.github.io/afdko/OpenTypeFeatureFileSpecification.html |title=OpenType Feature File Specification |accessdate=2019-03-20 }}</ref> OpenType Feature Files typically have a name ending in a <code>.fea</code> extension. These files can be compiled into the binary font container (<code>.ttf</code> or <code>.otf</code>) using [[Adobe Font Development Kit for OpenType]] (AFDKO), [[FontLab]], [[FontForge]], [[Glyphs]], [[DTL OTMaster]], [[RoboFont]] and [[FontTools]].\n\n==Layout tags==\nOpenType Layout tags are 4-byte character strings that identify the scripts, language systems, features and baselines in an OpenType Layout font. Microsoft's Layout tag registry establishes conventions for naming and using these tags. OpenType features are created by using the tags in creating feature scripts that describe how characters are to be manipulated to make the desired feature. These feature scripts can be created and incorporated into OpenType fonts by advanced font editors such as [[Fontlab|FontLab Studio]], AsiaFont Studio, and [[FontForge]].\n\nOperating system and application support for layout tags varies widely.\n\n===Script tags===\nScript tags identify the scripts (writing systems) represented in an OpenType typeface. Each tag corresponds to contiguous character code ranges in Unicode. A script tag can consist of 4 or fewer lowercase letters, such as <code>{{Sic|hide=y|ar|ab}}</code> for the [[Arabic alphabet]], <code>{{Sic|hide=y|cy|rl}}</code> for the [[Cyrillic script]] and <code>{{Sic|hide=y|la|tn}}</code> for the [[Latin alphabet]]. The <code>math</code> script tag, added by Microsoft for [[Cambria (typeface)|Cambria Math]], has been added to the specification.<ref name=\"scipttagregistry\">{{cite web|url=http://www.microsoft.com/typography/otspec/scripttags.htm|title=Script tags|date=2008-01-29|work=OpenType Layout tag registry|accessdate=2009-11-02}}</ref><ref name=\"isoiec14496222009\">{{cite web|url=http://standards.iso.org/ittf/PubliclyAvailableStandards/c052136_ISO_IEC_14496-22_2009(E).zip|title=ISO/IEC 14496-22:2009(E)|author=International Organization for Standardization and International Electrotechnical Commission|date=2009-08-15|work=Information technology \u2014 Coding of audio-visual objects \u2014 Part 22: Open Font Format (2nd ed)|pages=286 (section 6.4.1)|accessdate=2009-11-02}} (consent to non-chargeable online licence agreement required to download specification)</ref>\n\n===Language system tags===\nLanguage system tags identify the language systems supported in an OpenType typeface.

Ideographic writing scripts such as Chinese and Japanese do not have fixed collections of characters. They use thousands of glyphs commonly and tens of thousands less commonly. Not all glyphs ever invented and used in East Asian literature have even been catalogued. A typical font might contain 8,000 to 15,000 of the most commonly used glyphs. From time to time, though, an author needs a glyph not present in the font of choice. Such missing characters are known in Japan as gaiji, and they often disrupt work.\n\nAnother aspect of the gaiji problem is that of variant glyphs for certain characters. Often certain characters have been written differently over periods of time. It is not unusual for place names or personal family names to use a historical form of a character. Thus it is possible for an [[End-user (computer science)|end user]] using standard fonts to be left unable to spell correctly either their own name or the name of the place where they live.\n\nSeveral ways to deal with gaiji have been devised. Solutions that treat them as characters usually assign arbitrary Unicode values to them in the [[Private Use Areas]] (PUA). Such characters cannot be used outside the environment in which the association of the private Unicode to the glyph shape is known. Documents based on them are not portable. Other installations treat gaiji as graphics. This can be cumbersome because text layout and composition cannot apply to graphics. They cannot be searched for. Often their rendering looks different from surrounding characters because the machinery for rendering graphics usually is different from the machinery for rendering glyphs from fonts.\n\nThe SING (Smart INdependent Glyphlets)<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.adobe.com/devnet/opentype/gdk/topic.html |title=Adobe Glyphlet Development Kit (GDK) for SING Gaiji Architecture |publisher=Adobe.com |date= |accessdate=2009-11-11 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080627183635/http://www.adobe.com/devnet/opentype/gdk/topic.html |archivedate = June 27, 2008}}</ref><ref>DeLaHunt, Jim.

Such a packaged glyph is called a ''glyphlet''. The format, which Adobe has made public, is based on OpenType. The package consists of the glyph outline in TrueType or [[CFF fonts|CFF]] (PostScript style outlines) form; standard OpenType tables declaring the glyph's metrics and behavior in composition; and metadata, extra information included for identifying the glyphlet, its ownership, and perhaps pronunciation or linguistic categorization. SING glyphlets can be created using [[Fontlab]]'s SigMaker3 application.\n\nThe SING specification states that glyphlets are to [[font embedding|travel with the document]] they are used in. That way documents are portable, leaving no danger of characters in the document that cannot be displayed. Because glyphlets are essentially OpenType fonts, standard font machinery can render them. The SING specification also describes an [[XML]] format that includes all the data necessary for reconstituting the glyphlet in binary form. A typical glyphlet might require one to two kilobytes to represent.\n\n==Serbian Cyrillic solution==\n[[File:Cyrillic cursive.svg|thumb|150px|Variations in Cyrillic cursive.

Needing a more expressive font format to handle fine typography and the complex behavior of many of the world's writing systems, the two companies combined the underlying technologies of both formats and added new extensions intended to address those formats' limitations. The name OpenType was chosen for the combined technologies, and the technology was announced later that year.\n\n===Open Font Format===\nAdobe and Microsoft continued to develop and refine OpenType over the next decade.

By 2006, every major [[Type foundry|font foundry]] and many minor ones were developing fonts in OpenType format.{{Citation needed|date=July 2011|reason=uncited statistics}}\n\n===Unicode Variation Sequences===\nUnicode version 3.2 (published in 2002) introduced [[Variant form (Unicode)|variation selectors]] as an encoding mechanism to represent particular glyph forms for characters.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.unicode.org/reports/tr28/tr28-3.html |title=Unicode Standard Annex #28, Unicode 3.2 |website=www.unicode.org |date=2002-03-27 |accessdate=2017-04-22}}</ref> Unicode did not, however, specify how text-display implementations should support these sequences.

This resulted in development of cmap subtable Format 14, which was introduced in OpenType version 1.5.<ref name=\"OpenTypeChangeLog\">{{cite web |url=https://www.microsoft.com/typography/otspec/changes.htm |title=OpenType specification change log |website=www.microsoft.com |date= |accessdate=2017-04-22}}</ref>\n\n===Color fonts===\n\nUnicode version 6.0 introduced [[emoji]] encoded as characters into Unicode.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.unicode.org/versions/Unicode6.0.0/ |title=Unicode\u00ae 6.0.0 |website=www.unicode.org |date=2010-10-11 |accessdate=April 22, 2017}}</ref> Several companies quickly acted to add support for Unicode emoji in their products. Since Unicode emoji are handled as text, and since color is an essential aspect of the emoji experience, this led to a need to create mechanisms for displaying multicolor glyphs.\n\nApple, Google and Microsoft independently developed different color-font solutions for use in OS X/iOS, Android and Windows. OpenType / OFF already had support for monochrome bitmap glyph, and so Google proposed that OFF be extended to allow for color bitmaps. This was the approach being taken by Apple, though Apple declined to participate in extending the ISO standard. As a result, Apple added the 'sbix' table to their TrueType format in OS X 10.7,<ref>{{cite web |url=https://developer.apple.com/fonts/TrueType-Reference-Manual/RM06/Chap6sbix.html |title=The 'sbix' table |website=developer.apple.com |date= |accessdate=April 22, 2017}}</ref> while Google proposed addition of the CBDT and CBLC tables to OFF.\n\nMicrosoft adopted a different approach than color bitmaps. Noting existing practice on the Web of layering glyphs of different color on top of one another to create multi-colored elements such as icons, Microsoft proposed a new COLR table to map a glyph into a set of glyphs that are layered, and a CPAL table to define the colors.\n\nAdobe proposed yet another approach: add a new 'SVG ' table that can contain multi-color glyphs represented using [[Scalable Vector Graphics]].\n\nThe Adobe, Microsoft and Google proposals were all incorporated into the third edition of OFF (ISO/IEC 14496-22:2015).<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.iso.org/standard/66391.html |title=ISO/IEC 14496-22:2015 Information technology -- Coding of audio-visual objects -- Part 22: Open Font Format |website= |date=October 2015 |accessdate=2017-04-22}}</ref> The new tables\u2014CBDT, CBLC, COLR, CPAL, SVG\u2014were added to OpenType version 1.7.<ref name=\"OpenTypeChangeLog\"/>\n\nWhile Microsoft originally supported only the COLR/CPAL color format, support for all of the different color formats, including Apple's 'sbix' format, was added to [[Microsoft Windows]] in the Windows 10 Anniversary Update.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/hh802480(v=vs.85).aspx#what_s_new_for_windows_10_anniversary_update |title=What's new in DirectWrite |website=msdn.microsoft.com |date= |accessdate=2017-04-22}}</ref> The 'sbix' table was subsequently added to OpenType in version 1.8.<ref name=\"OpenTypeChangeLog\"/>\n\n===OpenType Collections===\n\nSince at least version 1.4, the OpenType specification had supported \u201cTrueType Collections\u201d, a feature of the format that allows multiple fonts to be stored in a single file. By combining related fonts into a single file, font tables that are identical can be shared, thereby allowing for more efficient storage. Also, individual fonts have a glyph-count limit of 65,535 glyphs, and a Collection file provides a mechanism for overcoming this limit in a single font file. (Each font within the collection still has the 65,535 limit, however.)\n\nA TrueType Collection file would typically have a file extension of \u201c.ttc\u201d.\n\nHowever, the specification only described collection files being used in conjunction with glyphs that are represented as TrueType outlines or as bitmaps. The potential existed to provide the same storage and glyph-count benefits to fonts that use CFF-format glyphs (.otf extension). But the specification did not explicitly allow for that.\n\nIn 2014, Adobe announced the creation of OpenType Collections (OTCs), a Collection font file that combines fonts that use CFF-format glyphs.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://blogs.adobe.com/CCJKType/2014/01/otc.html |title=Introducing & Building OpenType Collections (OTCs) |website=Blogs.adobe.com |date=2014-01-27 |accessdate=2017-01-19}}</ref> This provided significant storage benefits for [[CJK characters|CJK]] fonts that Adobe and Google were jointly developing. For example, the [[Noto fonts]] CJK OTC is ~10 MB smaller than the sum of the four separate OTFs of which it is composed.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.google.com/get/noto/help/cjk/ |title=Noto Sans CJK \u2013 Google Noto Fonts |website=Google.com |date= |accessdate=2017-01-19}}</ref> The use of a Collection also allowed for combining a very large number of glyphs into a single file, as would be needed for a pan-CJK font.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://lwn.net/Articles/613284/ |title=Google and Adobe's pan-CJK open font |website=Lwn.net |date= |accessdate=2017-01-19}}</ref>\n\nExplicit support for Collections with CFF-format glyphs was incorporated into the OpenType specification in version 1.8.<ref name=\"OpenTypeChangeLog\"/> To reflect this more-inclusive applicability, the term \u201cOpenType Collection\u201d was adopted, superseding \u201cTrueType Collection\u201d.\n\n=== OpenType Font Variations ===\n{{See also|Variable fonts}}\nOn September 14, 2016, Microsoft announced the release of OpenType version 1.8. This announcement was made together with Adobe, Apple, and Google at the [[ATypI]] conference in Warsaw.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-vdFRtcZU0 |title=Special OpenType Session |date=2016-09-14 |accessdate=2017-04-22}}</ref> OpenType version 1.8 introduced \u201cOpenType Font Variations\u201d, which adds mechanisms that allow a single font to support many design variations.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://medium.com/@tiro/https-medium-com-tiro-introducing-opentype-variable-fonts-12ba6cd2369 |title=Introducing OpenType Variable Fonts |author=John Hudson |date= |accessdate=2017-04-22}}</ref> Fonts that use these mechanisms are commonly referred to as \u201cOpenType variable fonts\u201d.\n\nOpenType Font Variations re-introduces techniques that were previously developed by Apple in [[Apple Advanced Typography|TrueType GX]], and by Adobe in [[Multiple master fonts|Multiple Master fonts]]. The common idea of these formats is that a single font includes data to describe multiple variations of a glyph outline (sometimes referred to as \u201cmasters\u201d), and that at text-display time, the font rasterizer is able to interpolate or \u201cblend\u201d these variations to derive a continuous range of additional outline variations.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.microsoft.com/typography/otspec/otvaroverview.htm |title=OpenType Font Variations Overview |website=www.microsoft.com |date= |accessdate=2017-04-22}}</ref>\n\nThe concept of fully parametric fonts had been explored in a more general way by [[Donald Knuth|Donald E. Knuth]] in the [[Metafont|METAFONT]] system, introduced in 1978.<ref>Knuth, Donald E. Mathematical typography. Bull. Amer. Math. Soc. (N.S.) 1 (1979), no. 2, 337--372.https://projecteuclid.org/euclid.bams/1183544082</ref> That system and its successors were never widely adopted by professional type designers or commercial software systems.<ref>CSTUG, Charles University, Prague, March 1996, Questions and Answers with Prof. Donald E.

Available online at http://www.tug.org/TUGboat/Articles/tb17-4/tb53knuc.pdf''</ref> TrueType GX and Multiple Master formats, OpenType Font Variations\u2019 direct predecessors, were introduced in the 1990s, but were not widely adopted, either. Adobe later abandoned support for the Multiple Master format.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://blog.typekit.com/2014/07/30/the-adobe-originals-silver-anniversary-story-how-the-originals-endured-in-an-ever-changing-industry/ |title=The Adobe Originals Silver Anniversary Story: How the Originals endured in an ever-changing industry |author=Tamye Riggs |date=2014-07-30 |access-date=2017-04-22}}</ref> This has led to questions as to whether a re-introduction of similar technology could succeed. By 2016, however, the industry landscape had changed in several respects. In particular, emergence of Web fonts and of mobile devices had created interest in [[Responsive web design|responsive design]] and in seeking ways to deliver more type variants in a size-efficient format. Also, whereas the 1990s was an era of aggressive competition in font technology, often referred to as \u201cthe font wars\u201d, OpenType Font Variations was developed in a collaborative manner involving several major vendors.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.pastemagazine.com/articles/2017/01/the-font-wars.html |title=The Font Wars |author=David Lemon |date=2017-01-27 |access-date=2017-04-22}}</ref>\n\nFont Variations is integrated into OpenType 1.8 in a comprehensive manner, allowing most previously-existing capabilities to be used in combination with variations. In particular, variations are supported for both TrueType or CFF glyph outlines, for TrueType hinting, and also for the OpenType Layout mechanisms. The only parts of OpenType for which variations are not supported but might potentially be useful are the SVG table for color glyphs, and the MATH table for layout of mathematical formulas. OpenType 1.8 made use of tables originally defined by Apple for TrueType GX (the avar, cvar, fvar and gvar tables). It also introduced several new tables, including a new table for version 2 of the CFF format (CFF2), and other new tables or additions to existing tables to integrate variations into other parts of the font format (the HVAR, MVAR, STAT and VVAR tables; additions to the BASE, GDEF and name tables).<ref name=\"OpenTypeChangeLog\"/>\n\n==Description==\n<gallery style=\"float:right;\">\nFile:Circle and quadratic bezier.svg|TrueType outlines use quadratic [[B\u00e9zier curve]]s.\nFile:Circle and cubic bezier.svg|CFF outlines use cubic B\u00e9zier curves.\n</gallery>\nOpenType uses the general [[sfnt]] structure of a TrueType font, but it adds several smartfont options that enhance the font's typographic and language support capabilities.\n\nThe [[glyph]] [[outline font|outline data]] in an OpenType font may be in one of two formats: either TrueType format outlines in a 'glyf' table, or [[Compact Font Format]] (CFF) outlines in a 'CFF&nbsp;' table. (The table name 'CFF&nbsp;' is four characters long, ending in a space character.) CFF outline data is based on the [[PostScript]] language Type 2 font format. However, the OpenType specification does not support the use of PostScript outlines in a TrueType Collection font file.\n\nFor many purposes, such as layout, it doesn't matter what the outline data format is, but for some purposes, such as [[rasterisation]], it is significant.  The OpenType standard does not specify the outline data format: rather, it accommodates any of several existing standards.  Sometimes terms like \"OpenType (PostScript flavor)\", (= \"Type 1 OpenType\", \"OpenType CFF\") or \"OpenType (TrueType flavor)\" are used to indicate which outline format a particular OpenType font file contains.\n\nOpenType has several distinctive characteristics:\n* Accommodates the [[Unicode]] [[character encoding]] (as well as others), so that it can support any writing script (or multiple scripts at once).\n* Accommodates up to 65,536 glyphs.\n* Advanced typographic \"layout\" features which prescribe positioning and replacement of rendered glyphs.  Replacement features include [[Typographic ligature|ligature]]s; positioning features include [[kerning]], mark placement, and [[Baseline (typography)|baseline]] specification.\n* Cross-platform font files, which can be used without modification on Mac OS, Microsoft Windows and Unix/Linux systems.\n* If no additional glyphs or extensive typographic features are added, OpenType CFF fonts can be considerably smaller than their Type 1 counterparts.\n\n==Comparison to other formats==\n{{unreferenced section|date=May 2013}}\nCompared with [[Apple Computer]]\u2019s \"GX Typography\"\u2014now called [[Apple Advanced Typography]] (AAT)\u2014and with the [[SIL International|SIL]]\u2019s [[Graphite (SIL)|Graphite]] technology, OpenType is less flexible in typographic options, but superior in language-related options and support.{{Clarify|date=February 2009}} Nevertheless, OpenType has been adopted much more widely than AAT or Graphite, despite AAT being the older technology.\n\nFrom a font developer's perspective, OpenType is, for many common situations, easier to develop for than AAT or Graphite. First, the simple declarative substitutions and positioning of OpenType are more readily understood than AAT's more complex state tables or the Graphite description language that resembles [[C syntax]]. Second, Adobe's strategy of licensing at no charge the [[source code]] developed for its own font development, AFDKO (Adobe Font Development Kit for OpenType), allowed third-party font editing applications such as [[FontLab]] and FontMaster to add support with relative ease. Although Adobe's text-driven coding support is not as visual as Microsoft's separate tool, VOLT (Visual OpenType Layout Tool), the integration with the tools being used to make the fonts has been well received.\n\nAnother difference is that an OpenType support framework (such as Microsoft's [[Uniscribe]]) needs to provide a fair bit of knowledge about special language processing issues to handle certain languages (e.g. Arabic). With AAT or Graphite, the font developer has to encapsulate all that expertise in the font. This means that AAT and Graphite can handle any arbitrary language, but that it requires more work and expertise from the font developers. On the other hand, OpenType fonts are easier to make, but can only support [[complex text layout]] if the application or operating system knows how to handle them.\n\nPrior to supporting OpenType, Adobe promoted [[multiple master fonts]] and [[expert fonts]] for high-end typography. Multiple master fonts were essentially an earlier (and less flexible) version of OpenType variable fonts, but lacked the controls for alternate glyphs and languages provided by OpenType. Expert fonts were a workaround for alternate glyphs, provided instead as separate supplementary fonts, such that certain special characters that had no place in the [[Adobe Standard Encoding]] character set\u2014ligatures, fractions, small capitals, etc.\u2014were placed in the expert font instead. Usage in applications was tricky, with, for example, typing a ''Z'' causing the ''ffl'' ligature to be generated. In modern OpenType fonts alternate glyphs are referenced by their relationship to the default glyph or glyphs (i.e. under what circumstances that glyph should be used) for the particular Unicode codepoint(s).\n\n==OpenType support==\n\n===Basic Roman support===\nOpenType support may be divided into several categories.{{Citation needed|date=March 2009}} Virtually all applications and most modern operating systems have basic Roman support and work with OpenType fonts just as well as other, older formats. Benefits beyond basic Roman support include extended language support through [[Unicode]], support for complex writing scripts such as [[Arabic language|Arabic]] and the [[Indo-Aryan languages|Indic languages]], and advanced typographic support for [[Latin alphabet|Latin script]] languages such as [[English language|English]].\n\nAmongst Microsoft's operating systems, OpenType TT fonts (.TTF) are backward compatible and therefore supported by all [[Microsoft Windows]] versions starting with Microsoft Windows 3.1. OpenType PS fonts (.OTF) are supported in all Windows versions starting with  Microsoft [[Windows 2000]]; [[Adobe Type Manager]] is required to be installed on Microsoft Windows 95/98/NT/Me for basic Roman support (only) of OpenType PS fonts.\n\n===Extended language support===\nExtended language support via Unicode for both OpenType and TrueType is present in most applications for Microsoft Windows {{Citation needed|date=June 2016}} (including [[Microsoft Office Publisher]], most Adobe applications, and Microsoft Office 2003, though not Word 2002), CorelDRAW X3 and newer, and many Mac OS X applications, including Apple's own such as [[TextEdit]], [[Pages (iWork)|Pages]] and [[Keynote (presentation creation software)|Keynote]]. It is also widely supported in free operating systems, such as Linux (e.g. in multiplatform applications like [[AbiWord]], [[Gnumeric]], [[Calligra Suite]], [[Scribus]], [[OpenOffice.org]] 3.2 and later versions,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://qa.openoffice.org/issues/show_bug.cgi?id=78858 |title=OpenOffice Supports OpenType Fonts ... |accessdate=2011-02-03}}</ref> etc.).\n\nOpenType support for [[complex script|complex written scripts]] has so far mainly appeared in Microsoft applications in [[Microsoft Office]], such as [[Microsoft Word]] and [[Microsoft Publisher]]. [[Adobe InDesign]] provides extensive OpenType capability in [[Japanese language|Japanese]] but does not directly support Middle Eastern or [[Brahmic family|Indic scripts]]\u2014though a separate version of InDesign is available that supports Middle Eastern scripts such as Arabic and Hebrew. Undocumented functionality in many Adobe Creative Suite 4 applications, including InDesign, Photoshop and Illustrator, enables Middle Eastern, Indic and other languages, but is not officially supported by Adobe, and requires third-party plug-ins to provide a user interface for the features.\n\n===Advanced typography===\nAdvanced typographic support for Latin script languages first appeared in Adobe applications such as [[Adobe InDesign]], [[Adobe Photoshop]] and [[Adobe Illustrator]]. [[QuarkXPress]] 6.5 and below were not Unicode compliant. Hence text in these versions of QuarkXPress that contains anything other than [[Code page#Windows (ANSI) code pages|WinANSI]]/[[Mac OS Roman|MacRoman]] characters will not display correctly in an OpenType font (nor in other Unicode font formats, for that matter). However, in QuarkXPress 7, Quark offered support similar to Adobe's. Corel's [[CorelDRAW]] introduced support for OpenType typographic features in version X6. [[Mellel]], a Mac OS X-only word processor from Redlers, claims parity in typographic features with InDesign, but also extends the support to right-to-left scripts; so does the [[Classical Text Editor]], a specialized word processor developed at the Austrian Academy of Sciences.\n\n{{As of|2009}}, popular word processors for Microsoft Windows did not support advanced OpenType typography features. Advanced typography features are implemented only in high-end [[desktop publishing]] software. The text engine from [[Windows Presentation Foundation]], which is a [[managed code]] implementation of OpenType, is the first Microsoft Windows [[Application Programming Interface|API]] to expose OpenType features to software developers, supporting both OpenType TrueType, and OpenType CFF ([[Compact Font Format]]) fonts. It supports advanced typographic features such as [[Typographical ligature|ligatures]], [[Text figures|old-style numerals]], [[swash (typography)|swash]] variants, [[fraction (mathematics)|fractions]], [[superscript]] and [[subscript]], [[small caps|small capitalization]], [[Font substitution|glyph substitution]], multiple [[baseline (typography)|baselines]], contextual and [[stylistic alternate]] character forms, kerning, line-level [[justification (typesetting)|justification]], [[ruby character]]s etc.<ref name=\"Sysm\u00e4l\u00e4inen\">{{cite web|last1=Sysm\u00e4l\u00e4inen|first1=Julia|title=Some Open Thoughts About OpenType|url=http://www.alphabettes.org/some-open-thoughts-about-opentype/|website=Alphabettes|accessdate=15 May 2016}}</ref> WPF applications automatically gain support for advanced typography features.

Apple's support for OpenType in Mac OS X 10.4 included most advanced typographic features necessary for [[Latin script]] languages, such as [[small caps]], [[oldstyle figures]], and various sorts of ligatures, but it did not yet support contextual alternates, positional forms, nor glyph reordering as handled by Microsoft's Uniscribe library on Windows. Thus, Mac OS X 10.4 did not offer support for Arabic or Indic scripts via OpenType (though such scripts are fully supported by existing AAT fonts). [[Mac OS X 10.5]] has improved support for OpenType and supports Arabic OpenType fonts. Gradually, the OpenType typography support has improved on newer Mac OS X versions (e.g. Mac OS X 10.10 can handle much better long contextual glyph substitutions).\n\nBitstream [[Panorama (Layout Engine)|Panorama]], a line layout and text composition engine from [[Bitstream Inc.]], provides complete OpenType support for compact and standard Asian fonts, Arabic, Hebrew, Indic, Thai and over 50 other worldwide languages. The application supports key OpenType tables required for line layout, such as BASE, glyph definition (GDEF), glyph positioning (GPOS), and glyph substitution (GSUB). Panorama also offers complete support for advanced typography features, such as ligatures, swashes, small caps, ornaments, ordinals, superiors, old style, kerning, fractions, etc.\n\nIn [[free software]] environments such as [[Linux]], OpenType rendering is provided by the [[FreeType]] project, included in free implementations of the [[X Window System]] such as [[X.Org Server|X.org]]. Complex text handling is provided either by [[pango]] (calling [[HarfBuzz]]) or [[Qt (toolkit)|Qt]]. The [[XeTeX]] and [[LuaTeX]] systems allow [[TeX]] documents to use OpenType fonts, along with most of their typographic features. Linux version of [[LibreOffice]] 4.1 and newer supports many OpenType typography features, because it began to use more sophisticated HarfBuzz text shaping library.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://wiki.documentfoundation.org/ReleaseNotes/4.1#Core/ |title=LibreOffice 4.1 ReleaseNotes |date= |accessdate= 2015-04-15}}</ref>\n\n==OpenType Feature File==\nAs a step in the creation of a font, OpenType font properties (other than the outline) can be defined using human-readable text saved in Adobe's OpenType Feature File format.<ref>Christopher Slye \u2013 OpenType feature files, ATypI 2006 [http://blogs.adobe.com/typblography/atypi2006/slye_lisbon-05.pdf slides]</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://adobe-type-tools.github.io/afdko/OpenTypeFeatureFileSpecification.html |title=OpenType Feature File Specification |accessdate=2019-03-20 }}</ref> OpenType Feature Files typically have a name ending in a <code>.fea</code> extension. These files can be compiled into the binary font container (<code>.ttf</code> or <code>.otf</code>) using [[Adobe Font Development Kit for OpenType]] (AFDKO), [[FontLab]], [[FontForge]], [[Glyphs]], [[DTL OTMaster]], [[RoboFont]] and [[FontTools]].\n\n==Layout tags==\nOpenType Layout tags are 4-byte character strings that identify the scripts, language systems, features and baselines in an OpenType Layout font. Microsoft's Layout tag registry establishes conventions for naming and using these tags. OpenType features are created by using the tags in creating feature scripts that describe how characters are to be manipulated to make the desired feature. These feature scripts can be created and incorporated into OpenType fonts by advanced font editors such as [[Fontlab|FontLab Studio]], AsiaFont Studio, and [[FontForge]].\n\nOperating system and application support for layout tags varies widely.\n\n===Script tags===\nScript tags identify the scripts (writing systems) represented in an OpenType typeface. Each tag corresponds to contiguous character code ranges in Unicode. A script tag can consist of 4 or fewer lowercase letters, such as <code>{{Sic|hide=y|ar|ab}}</code> for the [[Arabic alphabet]], <code>{{Sic|hide=y|cy|rl}}</code> for the [[Cyrillic script]] and <code>{{Sic|hide=y|la|tn}}</code> for the [[Latin alphabet]]. The <code>math</code> script tag, added by Microsoft for [[Cambria (typeface)|Cambria Math]], has been added to the specification.<ref name=\"scipttagregistry\">{{cite web|url=http://www.microsoft.com/typography/otspec/scripttags.htm|title=Script tags|date=2008-01-29|work=OpenType Layout tag registry|accessdate=2009-11-02}}</ref><ref name=\"isoiec14496222009\">{{cite web|url=http://standards.iso.org/ittf/PubliclyAvailableStandards/c052136_ISO_IEC_14496-22_2009(E).zip|title=ISO/IEC 14496-22:2009(E)|author=International Organization for Standardization and International Electrotechnical Commission|date=2009-08-15|work=Information technology \u2014 Coding of audio-visual objects \u2014 Part 22: Open Font Format (2nd ed)|pages=286 (section 6.4.1)|accessdate=2009-11-02}} (consent to non-chargeable online licence agreement required to download specification)</ref>\n\n===Language system tags===\nLanguage system tags identify the language systems supported in an OpenType typeface.

Ideographic writing scripts such as Chinese and Japanese do not have fixed collections of characters. They use thousands of glyphs commonly and tens of thousands less commonly. Not all glyphs ever invented and used in East Asian literature have even been catalogued. A typical font might contain 8,000 to 15,000 of the most commonly used glyphs. From time to time, though, an author needs a glyph not present in the font of choice. Such missing characters are known in Japan as gaiji, and they often disrupt work.\n\nAnother aspect of the gaiji problem is that of variant glyphs for certain characters. Often certain characters have been written differently over periods of time. It is not unusual for place names or personal family names to use a historical form of a character. Thus it is possible for an [[End-user (computer science)|end user]] using standard fonts to be left unable to spell correctly either their own name or the name of the place where they live.\n\nSeveral ways to deal with gaiji have been devised. Solutions that treat them as characters usually assign arbitrary Unicode values to them in the [[Private Use Areas]] (PUA). Such characters cannot be used outside the environment in which the association of the private Unicode to the glyph shape is known. Documents based on them are not portable. Other installations treat gaiji as graphics. This can be cumbersome because text layout and composition cannot apply to graphics. They cannot be searched for. Often their rendering looks different from surrounding characters because the machinery for rendering graphics usually is different from the machinery for rendering glyphs from fonts.\n\nThe SING (Smart INdependent Glyphlets)<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.adobe.com/devnet/opentype/gdk/topic.html |title=Adobe Glyphlet Development Kit (GDK) for SING Gaiji Architecture |publisher=Adobe.com |date= |accessdate=2009-11-11 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080627183635/http://www.adobe.com/devnet/opentype/gdk/topic.html |archivedate = June 27, 2008}}</ref><ref>DeLaHunt, Jim.

Retrieved 16 July 2009.</ref> technology that made its debut with Adobe's Creative Suite 2 allows for the creation of glyphs, each packaged as a standalone font, after a fashion. Such a packaged glyph is called a ''glyphlet''. The format, which Adobe has made public, is based on OpenType. The package consists of the glyph outline in TrueType or [[CFF fonts|CFF]] (PostScript style outlines) form; standard OpenType tables declaring the glyph's metrics and behavior in composition; and metadata, extra information included for identifying the glyphlet, its ownership, and perhaps pronunciation or linguistic categorization. SING glyphlets can be created using [[Fontlab]]'s SigMaker3 application.\n\nThe SING specification states that glyphlets are to [[font embedding|travel with the document]] they are used in. That way documents are portable, leaving no danger of characters in the document that cannot be displayed. Because glyphlets are essentially OpenType fonts, standard font machinery can render them. The SING specification also describes an [[XML]] format that includes all the data necessary for reconstituting the glyphlet in binary form. A typical glyphlet might require one to two kilobytes to represent.\n\n==Serbian Cyrillic solution==\n[[File:Cyrillic cursive.svg|thumb|150px|Variations in Cyrillic cursive. Letters in same row have the same code point.]]\n[[Serbian Cyrillic alphabet|Serbian/Macedonian Cyrillic]] uses some language-specific glyphs. In Unicode these are encoded in a single code point.

The organisation had an unofficial armed wing called '''National Liberation Front''', which carried out sabotage activities in [[Jammu and Kashmir]] as well as the [[1971 Indian Airlines hijacking|hijacking of Ganga]]. Amanullah Khan later moved to England, where he revived the National Liberation Front under the new name [[Jammu Kashmir Liberation Front]] (JKLF).{{sfn|Schofield, Kashmir in Conflict|2003|pp=114-116}}\n\n==History==\nThe Plebiscite Front was the initiative of [[Gilgit Agency|Gilgit]]-born [[Amanullah Khan (JKLF)|Amanullah Khan]], who after graduating with a Law degree in Karachi, set up a ''Kashmir Independence Committee'' advocating the ideology of independence for the entire princely state of [[Jammu and Kashmir (princely state)|Jammu and Kashmir]].<ref name=Rehman/>\n\nIn April 1965, the Kashmir Independence Committee merged into the newly launched Plebiscite Front in [[Muzaffarabad]]. [[Abdul Khaliq Ansari]] was its president, Amanullah Khan the general secretary and [[Maqbool Bhat]] the publicity secretary.<ref name=Rehman/><ref name=Ansari/> Journalist Arif Jamal states that, the participants drove to an unguarded location of the Kashmir [[Line of Control]] near [[Suchetgarh, Jammu and Kashmir|Suchetgarh]], brought back soil from the Indian-administered [[Jammu and Kashmir]], took an oath that they would work exclusively for the liberation of the former princely state.{{sfn|Jamal, Shadow War|2009|pp=87-88}}\n\n==National Liberation Front==\nAmanullah Khan and Maqbool Bhat also wanted to set up an armed wing for the Plebiscite Front, but the proposal did not get the majority support in the Plebiscite Front.  Undeterred, they established an underground group called ''National Liberation Front'' (NLF), obtaining some support for it in August 1965. The group was fashioned after the Algerian ''[[National Liberation Front (Algeria)|Front de Lib\u00e9ration Nationale]]''. Major Amanullah, a former soldier in the Azad Kashmir forces, was in charge of the armed wing while Amanullah Khan and Mir Abdul Qayoom took charge of the political and financial wings. Maqbool Bhat was made responsible for the overall coordination. All the members swore in blood that they would be ready to sacrifice their lives for the objective of the NLF, ''viz''., to create conditions in Jammu and Kashmir that enable its people to demand self-determination. The organisation was successful in recruiting members from Azad Kashmir, and obtained backing from the bureaucracy of the state.<ref name=Rehman/>{{sfn|Swami, India, Pakistan and the Secret Jihad|2007|p=104,&nbsp;107}}{{sfn|Jamal, Shadow War|2009|pp=88-89}}\n\nThe NLF recruited and trained a cadre of militants in the use of explosives and small arms.  Crossing into Indian-controlled Kashmir in 10 June 1966, they trained local workers in sabotage activities in the forests of [[Kupwara district|Kupwara]] and set up secret cells. However, in September 1966, Bhat's group was compromised, possibly via Ghulam Muhammad Dar, who acted as a double agent. The group kidnapped a police inspector and, when he tried to escape, shot and killed him. The Indian army zeroed in on them, leading to an exchange of fire in the Kunial village near [[Handwara]]. A member of Bhat's group, Kala Khan, was killed in the action. Bhat and a colleague named Mir Ahmad were captured and tried for sabotage and murder, receiving death sentences from a [[Srinagar]] court in September 1968. Major Amanullah's wing waiting to receive the volunteers at the Line of Control retreated, but it was arrested by the Pakistan Army.{{sfn|Swami, India, Pakistan and the Secret Jihad|2007|p=104}}{{sfn|Schofield, Kashmir in Conflict|2003|pp=114-115}}{{sfn|Jamal, Shadow War|2009|pp=88-89}}\n\nMaqbool Bhat's arrest brought the group's activities into the open, and sharply divided the Plebiscite Front. Nevertheless, they declared it an unconstitutional body and \"banned\" it. Meanwhile, Maqbool Bhat and Mir Ahmad escaped from the Indian prison in December 1968, along with another inmate Ghulam Yasin, tunneling their way out of the prison complex. They returned to Azad Kashmir in January 1969, creating a sensation in the militant circles. Their standing increased within the community, forcing the Plebiscite Front to abandon its opposition. However, the NLF's failed operations in Jammu and Kashmir put at risk all its sympathisers in the state, many of whom were arrested.{{sfn|Schofield, Kashmir in Conflict|2003|p=115}}{{sfn|Swami, India, Pakistan and the Secret Jihad|2007|pp=107-108}}{{sfn|Jamal, Shadow War|2009|pp=90-91}}\n\nThe militants' escape from an Indian prison was viewed with suspicion by Pakistan. Bhat and his colleagues were detained and brutally interrogated for several months.<ref name=\"Ansari 1971\">\n[http://jkdlp.org/?p=271 Statement of Advocate Abdul Khaliq Ansari before \u2018Azad Kashmir\u201d High Court in 1971], Jammu Kashmir Democratic Liberation Party, 8 June 2015.\n</ref> Long after their release, Bhat was still suspected of being a double agent. Pakistan extended little support to the other Indian youth that crossed over into Azad Kashmir for arms and training. [[Praveen Swami]] suggests that, as Pakistan was waging a covert war through its own network in Jammu and Kashmir, it did not want those official operations jeopardised by the amateur operators of the NLF.{{sfn|Swami, India, Pakistan and the Secret Jihad|2007|pp=108-109}}\n\nThe NLF continued its activities, sponsoring bomb explosions in the [[Jammu Division|Jammu province]]. It targeted public places, such as railway stations and bus stations, and military installations in and around the cities of [[Jammu]] and [[Poonch (town)|Poonch]]. However, the international attention it was hoping to galvanise through the bombing campaign did not materialise.{{sfn|Jamal, Shadow War|2009|p=91}}\n\n==Ganga hijacking==\n[[Hashim Qureshi]], a [[Srinagar]] resident who went to [[Peshawar]] on family business in 1969, met Maqbool Bhat and got inducted into the NLF. He was given an ideological education and lessons in guerrilla tactics in [[Rawalpindi]]. In order to draw the world's attention to the Kashmiri independence movement, the group planned an airline hijacking fashioned after the [[Dawson's Field hijackings]] by the [[Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine|Palestinian militants]]. Hashim Qureshi, along with his cousin Ashraf Qureshi, was ordered to execute one. A former Pakistani air force pilot Jamshed Manto trained him for the task. However, Qureshi was arrested by the Indian [[Border Security Force]] when he tried to reenter Indian-held Kashmir with arms and equipment. He negotiated his way out by claiming to help find other conspirators that were allegedly in the Indian territory, sought an appointment in the Border Security Force to provide such help. Maqbool Bhat sent Qureshi replacement equipment for the hijacking, but it fell into the hands of a double agent, who then turned it over to the Indian authorities. Undeterred, the Qureshis made look-alike explosives out of wood and hijacked an [[Indian Airlines]] plane called Ganga on 30 January 1971.{{sfn|Swami, India, Pakistan and the Secret Jihad|2007|pp=112-113}}{{sfn|Jamal, Shadow War|2009|p=92-93}}\n\nThe hijackers landed the plane at [[Lahore]] and demanded the release of 36 NLF prisoners lodged in Indian jails. However, they succumbed to pressure from the airport authorities and ended up releasing all the passengers and the crew. Years later, Ashraf Qureshi admitted that they were naive and didn't realise that \"the passengers were more important than the actual plane.\" Pakistan's Prime Minister [[Zulfikar Bhutto]] showed up at the airport and paid a handsome tribute to the hijackers. Indian Government then refused to carry out the demands. The plane lay on the tarmac for eighty hours, during which the Pakistani security personnel thoroughly searched the air plane and removed papers and postal bags they found in it. Eventually, upon the advice of the authorities, Hashim Qureshi burnt the plane down.{{sfn|Swami, India, Pakistan and the Secret Jihad|2007|pp=112-113}}{{sfn|Jamal, Shadow War|2009|p=94-95}}\n\nFor some time, the Qureshis were lauded as heroes. After India reacted by banning overflight of Pakistani planes over India, the Pakistani authorities claimed that the hijack was staged by India, and arrested the hijackers and all their collaborators. A one-man investigation committee headed by Justice Noorul Arifeen declared the hijacking to be an Indian conspiracy, citing Qureshi's appointment in the Border Security Force. In addition to the hijackers, Maqbool Bhat and 150 other NLF fighters were arrested. Seven people were eventually brought to trial (the rest being held without charges). The High Court acquitted them of treason charges. Hashim Qureshi alone was sentenced to seven years in prison. Ironically, Ashraf Qureshi was released even though he was an equal participant in the hijacking. This is said to have been a deal made by Zulikar Bhutto, by now the President of Pakistan, who declared that he would convict one hijacker but release the other.{{sfn|Swami, India, Pakistan and the Secret Jihad|2007|pp=112-113}}{{sfn|Jamal, Shadow War|2009|p=96-97}}\n\nAmanullah Khan was also imprisoned for 15 months in a Gilgit prison during 1970-72, accused of being an Indian agent. He was released after protests broke out in Gilgit. Thirteen of his colleagues were sentenced to 14 years in prison, but released after a year.<ref name=Catch>\n[http://www.catchnews.com/politics-news/in-amanullah-khan-s-death-kashmiri-separatism-lost-its-champion-1461747721.html In Amanullah Khan's death Kashmiri separatism lost its champion], Catch News, 27 April 2016.\n</ref> According to Hashim Qureshi, 400 activists of the Plebiscite Front and NLF were arrested in Pakistan after the Ganga hijacking.<ref name=Ansari/> Abdul Khaliq Ansari, who was arrested and tortured, testified in the [[High Court of Azad Kashmir|High Court]] that the Ganga hijacking had emboldened the people to question the corrupt practices of the Azad Kashmir leaders and, in reaction, the government arrested them and forced them to confess to being Indian agents.<ref>[http://jkdlp.org/?p=271 Statement of Advocate Abdul Khaliq Ansari before \u2018Azad Kashmir\u201d High Court in 1971], Jammu Kashmir Democratic Liberation Party, 8 June 2015.</ref>\n\n== Post-hijack operations ==\nFurther attempts by the NLF to infiltrate into Indian-controlled Kashmir also met with failure. [[Praveen Swami]] states that the organisation did not have enough funds and infrastructure, or support from other sources, to make an impact inside India.{{sfn|Swami, India, Pakistan and the Secret Jihad|2007|pp=108-109}} Paul Staniland adds that \"State repression\" in the Indian-controlled Kashmir also played a key role.{{sfn|Staniland, Networks of Rebellion|2014|pp=68-69}}\n\nIn May 1976, Maqbool Bhat reentered the Indian-controlled Kashmir again. He was encouraged by the student protests against the [[1974 Indira-Sheikh accord]], by which [[Sheikh Abdullah]] agreed to return to constitutional politics. Bhat attempted to rob a bank in [[Kupwara]]. A bank employee was killed in the course of the robbery. Bhat was rearrested and received a second death sentence.{{sfn|Swami, India, Pakistan and the Secret Jihad|2007|p=129}}\n\nBhat's arrest effectively broke the back of the NLF in Azad Kashmir. Amanullah Khan moved to England, where he received the enthusiastic support of the [[British Mirpuri]] community. The UK chapter of the Plebiscite Front was converted into the [[Jammu and Kashmir Liberation Front]] (JKLF) in May 1977 and formed an armed wing called the `National Liberation Army'. Amanullah Khan took charge as the General Secretary of JKLF the following February.{{sfn|Swami, India, Pakistan and the Secret Jihad|2007|pp=129-130}}\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|30em}}\n\n==Bibliography==\n* {{citation |last=Jamal |first=Arif |title=Shadow War: The Untold Story of Jihad in Kashmir |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=TNO5MAAACAAJ |year=2009 |publisher=Melville House |isbn=978-1-933633-59-6 |ref={{sfnref|Jamal, Shadow War|2009}}}}\n* {{citation |first=Victoria |last=Schofield |authorlink=Victoria Schofield |title=Kashmir in Conflict |publisher=I.

Crossing into Indian-controlled Kashmir in 10 June 1966, they trained local workers in sabotage activities in the forests of [[Kupwara district|Kupwara]] and set up secret cells. However, in September 1966, Bhat's group was compromised, possibly via Ghulam Muhammad Dar, who acted as a double agent. The group kidnapped a police inspector and, when he tried to escape, shot and killed him. The Indian army zeroed in on them, leading to an exchange of fire in the Kunial village near [[Handwara]]. A member of Bhat's group, Kala Khan, was killed in the action. Bhat and a colleague named Mir Ahmad were captured and tried for sabotage and murder, receiving death sentences from a [[Srinagar]] court in September 1968. Major Amanullah's wing waiting to receive the volunteers at the Line of Control retreated, but it was arrested by the Pakistan Army.{{sfn|Swami, India, Pakistan and the Secret Jihad|2007|p=104}}{{sfn|Schofield, Kashmir in Conflict|2003|pp=114-115}}{{sfn|Jamal, Shadow War|2009|pp=88-89}}\n\nMaqbool Bhat's arrest brought the group's activities into the open, and sharply divided the Plebiscite Front. Nevertheless, they declared it an unconstitutional body and \"banned\" it. Meanwhile, Maqbool Bhat and Mir Ahmad escaped from the Indian prison in December 1968, along with another inmate Ghulam Yasin, tunneling their way out of the prison complex. They returned to Azad Kashmir in January 1969, creating a sensation in the militant circles. Their standing increased within the community, forcing the Plebiscite Front to abandon its opposition. However, the NLF's failed operations in Jammu and Kashmir put at risk all its sympathisers in the state, many of whom were arrested.{{sfn|Schofield, Kashmir in Conflict|2003|p=115}}{{sfn|Swami, India, Pakistan and the Secret Jihad|2007|pp=107-108}}{{sfn|Jamal, Shadow War|2009|pp=90-91}}\n\nThe militants' escape from an Indian prison was viewed with suspicion by Pakistan. Bhat and his colleagues were detained and brutally interrogated for several months.<ref name=\"Ansari 1971\">\n[http://jkdlp.org/?p=271 Statement of Advocate Abdul Khaliq Ansari before \u2018Azad Kashmir\u201d High Court in 1971], Jammu Kashmir Democratic Liberation Party, 8 June 2015.\n</ref> Long after their release, Bhat was still suspected of being a double agent. Pakistan extended little support to the other Indian youth that crossed over into Azad Kashmir for arms and training. [[Praveen Swami]] suggests that, as Pakistan was waging a covert war through its own network in Jammu and Kashmir, it did not want those official operations jeopardised by the amateur operators of the NLF.{{sfn|Swami, India, Pakistan and the Secret Jihad|2007|pp=108-109}}\n\nThe NLF continued its activities, sponsoring bomb explosions in the [[Jammu Division|Jammu province]]. It targeted public places, such as railway stations and bus stations, and military installations in and around the cities of [[Jammu]] and [[Poonch (town)|Poonch]]. However, the international attention it was hoping to galvanise through the bombing campaign did not materialise.{{sfn|Jamal, Shadow War|2009|p=91}}\n\n==Ganga hijacking==\n[[Hashim Qureshi]], a [[Srinagar]] resident who went to [[Peshawar]] on family business in 1969, met Maqbool Bhat and got inducted into the NLF. He was given an ideological education and lessons in guerrilla tactics in [[Rawalpindi]]. In order to draw the world's attention to the Kashmiri independence movement, the group planned an airline hijacking fashioned after the [[Dawson's Field hijackings]] by the [[Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine|Palestinian militants]]. Hashim Qureshi, along with his cousin Ashraf Qureshi, was ordered to execute one. A former Pakistani air force pilot Jamshed Manto trained him for the task. However, Qureshi was arrested by the Indian [[Border Security Force]] when he tried to reenter Indian-held Kashmir with arms and equipment. He negotiated his way out by claiming to help find other conspirators that were allegedly in the Indian territory, sought an appointment in the Border Security Force to provide such help. Maqbool Bhat sent Qureshi replacement equipment for the hijacking, but it fell into the hands of a double agent, who then turned it over to the Indian authorities. Undeterred, the Qureshis made look-alike explosives out of wood and hijacked an [[Indian Airlines]] plane called Ganga on 30 January 1971.{{sfn|Swami, India, Pakistan and the Secret Jihad|2007|pp=112-113}}{{sfn|Jamal, Shadow War|2009|p=92-93}}\n\nThe hijackers landed the plane at [[Lahore]] and demanded the release of 36 NLF prisoners lodged in Indian jails. However, they succumbed to pressure from the airport authorities and ended up releasing all the passengers and the crew. Years later, Ashraf Qureshi admitted that they were naive and didn't realise that \"the passengers were more important than the actual plane.\" Pakistan's Prime Minister [[Zulfikar Bhutto]] showed up at the airport and paid a handsome tribute to the hijackers. Indian Government then refused to carry out the demands. The plane lay on the tarmac for eighty hours, during which the Pakistani security personnel thoroughly searched the air plane and removed papers and postal bags they found in it. Eventually, upon the advice of the authorities, Hashim Qureshi burnt the plane down.{{sfn|Swami, India, Pakistan and the Secret Jihad|2007|pp=112-113}}{{sfn|Jamal, Shadow War|2009|p=94-95}}\n\nFor some time, the Qureshis were lauded as heroes. After India reacted by banning overflight of Pakistani planes over India, the Pakistani authorities claimed that the hijack was staged by India, and arrested the hijackers and all their collaborators. A one-man investigation committee headed by Justice Noorul Arifeen declared the hijacking to be an Indian conspiracy, citing Qureshi's appointment in the Border Security Force. In addition to the hijackers, Maqbool Bhat and 150 other NLF fighters were arrested. Seven people were eventually brought to trial (the rest being held without charges). The High Court acquitted them of treason charges. Hashim Qureshi alone was sentenced to seven years in prison. Ironically, Ashraf Qureshi was released even though he was an equal participant in the hijacking. This is said to have been a deal made by Zulikar Bhutto, by now the President of Pakistan, who declared that he would convict one hijacker but release the other.{{sfn|Swami, India, Pakistan and the Secret Jihad|2007|pp=112-113}}{{sfn|Jamal, Shadow War|2009|p=96-97}}\n\nAmanullah Khan was also imprisoned for 15 months in a Gilgit prison during 1970\u201372, accused of being an Indian agent. He was released after protests broke out in Gilgit. Thirteen of his colleagues were sentenced to 14 years in prison, but released after a year.<ref name=Catch>\n[http://www.catchnews.com/politics-news/in-amanullah-khan-s-death-kashmiri-separatism-lost-its-champion-1461747721.html In Amanullah Khan's death Kashmiri separatism lost its champion], Catch News, 27 April 2016.\n</ref> According to Hashim Qureshi, 400 activists of the Plebiscite Front and NLF were arrested in Pakistan after the Ganga hijacking.<ref name=Ansari/> Abdul Khaliq Ansari, who was arrested and tortured, testified in the [[High Court of Azad Kashmir|High Court]] that the Ganga hijacking had emboldened the people to question the corrupt practices of the Azad Kashmir leaders and, in reaction, the government arrested them and forced them to confess to being Indian agents.<ref name=\"Ansari 1971\"/>\n\n== Post-hijack operations ==\nFurther attempts by the NLF to infiltrate into Indian-controlled Kashmir also met with failure. [[Praveen Swami]] states that the organisation did not have enough funds and infrastructure, or support from other sources, to make an impact inside India.{{sfn|Swami, India, Pakistan and the Secret Jihad|2007|pp=108-109}} Paul Staniland adds that \"State repression\" in the Indian-controlled Kashmir also played a key role.{{sfn|Staniland, Networks of Rebellion|2014|pp=68-69}}\n\nIn May 1976, Maqbool Bhat reentered the Indian-controlled Kashmir again. He was encouraged by the student protests against the [[1974 Indira-Sheikh accord]], by which [[Sheikh Abdullah]] agreed to return to constitutional politics. Bhat attempted to rob a bank in [[Kupwara]]. A bank employee was killed in the course of the robbery. Bhat was rearrested and received a second death sentence.{{sfn|Swami, India, Pakistan and the Secret Jihad|2007|p=129}}\n\nBhat's arrest effectively broke the back of the NLF in Azad Kashmir. Amanullah Khan moved to England, where he received the enthusiastic support of the [[British Mirpuri]] community. The UK chapter of the Plebiscite Front was converted into the [[Jammu and Kashmir Liberation Front]] (JKLF) in May 1977 and formed an armed wing called the `National Liberation Army'. Amanullah Khan took charge as the General Secretary of JKLF the following February.{{sfn|Swami, India, Pakistan and the Secret Jihad|2007|pp=129-130}}\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|30em}}\n\n==Bibliography==\n* {{citation |last=Jamal |first=Arif |title=Shadow War: The Untold Story of Jihad in Kashmir |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=TNO5MAAACAAJ |year=2009 |publisher=Melville House |isbn=978-1-933633-59-6 |ref={{sfnref|Jamal, Shadow War|2009}}}}\n* {{citation |first=Victoria |last=Schofield |authorlink=Victoria Schofield |title=Kashmir in Conflict |publisher=I.

Fleeing from what they saw as oppressive social conformity, a loose collection of writers, poets, artists, and students (later known as the [[Beat generation|Beats]]) and the [[Beatniks]], moved to Greenwich Village, and to [[North Beach, San Francisco, California|North Beach]] in [[San Francisco]], in many ways creating the [[East Coast of the United States|U.S. East Coast]] and [[West Coast of the United States|West Coast]] predecessors, respectively, to the [[East Village, Manhattan|East Village]]-[[Haight Ashbury]]  [[Hippie|hippie scene]] of the next decade. The Village (and surrounding New York City) would later play central roles in the writings of, among others, [[Maya Angelou]], [[James Baldwin (writer)|James Baldwin]], [[William S. Burroughs]], [[Truman Capote]], [[Allen Ginsberg]], [[Jack Kerouac]], [[Rod McKuen]], [[Marianne Moore]], and [[Dylan Thomas]], who collapsed at the [[Hotel Chelsea|Chelsea Hotel]], and died at [[St. Vincent's Hospital, Manhattan|St. Vincents Hospital]] at 170 West 12th Street, in the Village after drinking at the [[White Horse Tavern (New York City)|White Horse Tavern]] on November 5, 1953.\n\n[[Off-Off-Broadway]] began in Greenwich Village in 1958 as a reaction to [[Off Broadway]], and a \"complete rejection of commercial theatre\".<ref>Viagas (2004, p. 72)</ref> Among the first venues for what would soon be called \"Off-Off-Broadway\" (a term supposedly coined by [[critic]] Jerry Tallmer of the ''[[Village Voice]]'') were coffeehouses in Greenwich Village, in particular, the [[Caffe Cino]] at 31 Cornelia Street, operated by the eccentric [[Joe Cino]], who early on took a liking to actors and playwrights and agreed to let them stage plays there without bothering to read the plays first, or to even find out much about the content. Also integral to the rise of Off-Off-Broadway were [[Ellen Stewart]] at [[La MaMa, E.T.C.|La MaMa]], originally located at 321 E. 9th Street, and [[Al Carmines]] at the Judson Poets' Theater, located at [[Judson Memorial Church]] on the south side of [[Washington Square Park]].\n\n[[File:Blue Note Jazz Club, New York City.jpg|thumb|[[Blue Note Jazz Club]]]]\nThe Village had a cutting-edge cabaret and music scene. ''[[The Village Gate]]'', the ''[[Village Vanguard]]'', and the ''[[Blue Note Jazz Club|Blue Note]]'' (since 1981) regularly hosted some of the biggest names in [[jazz]]. Greenwich Village also played a major role in the development of the [[American folk music revival|folk music scene]] of the 1960s. Music clubs included ''[[Gerde's Folk City]]'', ''[[The Bitter End]],'' ''[[Cafe Au Go Go]]'', ''[[Cafe Wha?]]'', ''[[The Gaslight Cafe]]'' and ''[[The Bottom Line (venue)|The Bottom Line]]''. Three of the four members of [[the Mamas & the Papas]] met there. Guitarist and folk singer [[Dave Van Ronk]] lived there for many years. Village resident and cultural icon [[Bob Dylan]] by the mid-60s had become one of the world's foremost popular songwriters, and often developments in Greenwich Village would influence the simultaneously occurring [[folk rock]] movement in [[San Francisco]] and elsewhere, and vice versa. Dozens of other cultural and popular icons got their start in the Village's nightclub, theater, and coffeehouse scene during the 1950s, 1960s, and early 1970s, including [[Eric Andersen]], [[Joan Baez]], [[Jackson Browne]], [[the Clancy Brothers and Tommy Makem]], [[Richie Havens]], [[Jimi Hendrix]], [[Janis Ian]], the [[The Kingston Trio|Kingston Trio]], the [[The Lovin' Spoonful|Lovin' Spoonful]], [[Bette Midler]], [[Liza Minnelli]], [[Joni Mitchell]], [[Maria Muldaur]], [[Laura Nyro]], [[Phil Ochs]], [[Tom Paxton]], [[Peter, Paul, and Mary]], [[Carly Simon]], [[Simon & Garfunkel]], [[Nina Simone]], [[Barbra Streisand]], [[James Taylor]], and the [[The Velvet Underground|Velvet Underground]]. The Greenwich Village of the 1950s and 1960s was at the center of [[Jane Jacobs]]'s book ''[[The Death and Life of Great American Cities]]'', which defended it and similar communities, while criticizing common [[urban renewal]] policies of the time.\n\nFounded by New York-based artist [[Mercedes Matter]] and her students, the [[New York Studio School of Drawing, Painting and Sculpture]] is an art school formed in the mid-1960s in the Village. Officially opened September 23, 1964, the school is still active, at 8 W. 8th Street, the site of the original [[Whitney Museum of American Art]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.nyss.org/schoolhistory.asp |title=New York Studio School of Drawing, Painting and Sculpture: The School: Its History |last1=Matter |first1=Mercedes |date=2002 |website=nyss.org |publisher=New York Studio School |access-date=February 27, 2016 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090426072430/http://www.nyss.org/schoolhistory.asp |archivedate=April 26, 2009}}</ref>\n\nGreenwich Village was home to a safe house used by the radical [[anti-war movement]] known as the [[Weatherman (organization)|Weather Underground]]. On March 6, 1970, their safehouse was destroyed when an explosive device they were constructing was accidentally detonated, killing three of their members ([[Ted Gold]], [[Terry Robbins]], and [[Diana Oughton]]).\n\nThe Village has been a center for movements that challenged the wider American culture, for example, its role in the [[gay liberation]] movement. The [[Stonewall riots]] were a series of spontaneous, violent demonstrations by members of the [[LGBT community|gay community]] against a [[police raid]] that took place in the early morning hours of June 28, 1969, at the [[Stonewall Inn]], 53 [[Christopher Street (Manhattan)|Christopher Street]]. Considered together,  the demonstrations are widely considered to constitute the single most important event leading to the [[gay liberation]] movement and the modern fight for [[LGBT rights in the United States]].<ref>{{cite web |author=National Park Service |title=Workforce Diversity: The Stonewall Inn, National Historic Landmark National Register Number: 99000562 |url=http://www.nps.gov/diversity/stonewall.htm |publisher=US Dept. of Interior |year=2008 |accessdate=July 28, 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.northjersey.com/news/2012_Presidential_Election/Obama_inaugural_speech_references_Stonewall_riots.html |title=Obama inaugural speech references Stonewall gay-rights riots |publisher=North Jersey Media Group |date=January 21, 2013|accessdate=July 28, 2014 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130530065722/http://www.northjersey.com/news/2012_Presidential_Election/Obama_inaugural_speech_references_Stonewall_riots.html |archivedate=May 30, 2013}}</ref> On June 23, 2015, the Stonewall Inn was the first landmark in New York City to be recognized by the [[New York City Landmarks Preservation Commission]] on the basis of its status in LGBT history,<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.northjersey.com/news/nyc-grants-landmark-status-to-gay-rights-movement-building-1.1361241|title=NYC grants landmark status to gay rights movement building|agency=Associated Press|publisher=North Jersey Media Group|date=June 23, 2015|accessdate=June 23, 2015|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160303201003/http://www.northjersey.com/news/nyc-grants-landmark-status-to-gay-rights-movement-building-1.1361241|archivedate=March 3, 2016}}</ref> and on June 24, 2016, the [[Stonewall National Monument]] was named the first [[List of U.S. National Monuments|U.S. National Monument]] dedicated to the LGBTQ-rights movement.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2016/06/25/nyregion/stonewall-inn-named-national-monument-a-first-for-gay-rights-movement.html|title=Stonewall Inn Named National Monument, a First for the Gay Rights Movement|author=Eli Rosenberg|newspaper=The New York Times|date=June 24, 2016|accessdate=June 24, 2016}}</ref> Greenwich Village contains the world's oldest gay and lesbian bookstore, [[Oscar Wilde Bookshop]], founded in 1967, while The Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual & Transgender Community Center \u2013 best known as simply \"The Center\" \u2013 has occupied the former Food & Maritime Trades High School at 208 West 13th Street since 1984.

In the 1960s, [[Margot Gayle]] led a group of citizens to preserve the [[Jefferson Market Courthouse]] (later reused as Jefferson Market Library),<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/09/30/nyregion/30gayle.html|work=The New York Times|title=Margot Gayle, Urban Preservationist and Crusader With Style, Dies at 100|date=September 30, 2008|accessdate=May 4, 2010}}</ref> while other citizen groups fought to keep traffic out of Washington Square Park,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nycgovparks.org/parks/washingtonsquarepark/highlights/9763|author=NYC Dept. of Parks and Recreation|title=Shirley Hayes and the Preservation of Washington Square Park}}</ref> and [[Jane Jacobs]], using the Village as an example of a vibrant urban community, advocated to keep it that way.\n\nSince then, preservation has been a part of the Village ethos. Shortly after the New York City Landmarks Preservation Commission (LPC) was established in 1965, it acted to protect parts of Greenwich Village, designating the small [[Charlton-King-Vandam Historic District]] in 1966, which contains the city's largest concentration of row houses in the Federal style, as well as a significant concentration of Greek Revival houses, and the even smaller [[MacDougal-Sullivan Gardens Historic District]] in 1967, a group of 22 houses sharing a common back garden, built in the Greek Revival style and later renovated with Colonial Revival fa\u00e7ades. In 1969, the LPC designated the Greenwich Village Historic District \u2013 which remained the city's largest for four decades \u2013 despite preservationists' advocacy for the entire neighborhood to be designated an historic district. Advocates continued to pursue their goal of additional designation, spurred in particular by the increased pace of development in the 1990s.\n\n====Rezoned areas====\n[[File:396-397 West Street.jpg|thumb|right|250px|396-397 West Street at West 10th Street is a former hotel which dates from 1904, and is part of the Weehawken Street Historic District]]\nThe [[Greenwich Village Society for Historic Preservation]] (GVSHP), a [[nonprofit organization]] dedicated to the architectural and cultural character and heritage of the neighborhood, successfully proposed new districts and individual landmarks to the LPC.

Fleeing from what they saw as oppressive social conformity, a loose collection of writers, poets, artists, and students (later known as the [[Beat generation|Beats]]) and the [[Beatniks]], moved to Greenwich Village, and to [[North Beach, San Francisco, California|North Beach]] in [[San Francisco]], in many ways creating the [[East Coast of the United States|U.S. East Coast]] and [[West Coast of the United States|West Coast]] predecessors, respectively, to the [[East Village, Manhattan|East Village]]-[[Haight Ashbury]]  [[Hippie|hippie scene]] of the next decade. The Village (and surrounding New York City) would later play central roles in the writings of, among others, [[Maya Angelou]], [[James Baldwin (writer)|James Baldwin]], [[William S. Burroughs]], [[Truman Capote]], [[Allen Ginsberg]], [[Jack Kerouac]], [[Rod McKuen]], [[Marianne Moore]], and [[Dylan Thomas]], who collapsed at the [[Hotel Chelsea|Chelsea Hotel]], and died at [[St. Vincent's Hospital, Manhattan|St. Vincents Hospital]] at 170 West 12th Street, in the Village after drinking at the [[White Horse Tavern (New York City)|White Horse Tavern]] on November 5, 1953.\n\n[[Off-Off-Broadway]] began in Greenwich Village in 1958 as a reaction to [[Off Broadway]], and a \"complete rejection of commercial theatre\".<ref>Viagas (2004, p. 72)</ref> Among the first venues for what would soon be called \"Off-Off-Broadway\" (a term supposedly coined by [[critic]] Jerry Tallmer of the ''[[Village Voice]]'') were coffeehouses in Greenwich Village, in particular, the [[Caffe Cino]] at 31 Cornelia Street, operated by the eccentric [[Joe Cino]], who early on took a liking to actors and playwrights and agreed to let them stage plays there without bothering to read the plays first, or to even find out much about the content. Also integral to the rise of Off-Off-Broadway were [[Ellen Stewart]] at [[La MaMa, E.T.C.|La MaMa]], originally located at 321 E. 9th Street, and [[Al Carmines]] at the Judson Poets' Theater, located at [[Judson Memorial Church]] on the south side of [[Washington Square Park]].\n\n[[File:Blue Note Jazz Club, New York City.jpg|thumb|[[Blue Note Jazz Club]]]]\nThe Village had a cutting-edge cabaret and music scene. ''[[The Village Gate]]'', the ''[[Village Vanguard]]'', and the ''[[Blue Note Jazz Club|Blue Note]]'' (since 1981) regularly hosted some of the biggest names in [[jazz]]. Greenwich Village also played a major role in the development of the [[American folk music revival|folk music scene]] of the 1960s. Music clubs included ''[[Gerde's Folk City]]'', ''[[The Bitter End]],'' ''[[Cafe Au Go Go]]'', ''[[Cafe Wha?]]'', ''[[The Gaslight Cafe]]'' and ''[[The Bottom Line (venue)|The Bottom Line]]''. Three of the four members of [[the Mamas & the Papas]] met there. Guitarist and folk singer [[Dave Van Ronk]] lived there for many years. Village resident and cultural icon [[Bob Dylan]] by the mid-60s had become one of the world's foremost popular songwriters, and often developments in Greenwich Village would influence the simultaneously occurring [[folk rock]] movement in [[San Francisco]] and elsewhere, and vice versa. Dozens of other cultural and popular icons got their start in the Village's nightclub, theater, and coffeehouse scene during the 1950s, 1960s, and early 1970s, including [[Eric Andersen]], [[Joan Baez]], [[Jackson Browne]], [[the Clancy Brothers and Tommy Makem]], [[Richie Havens]], [[Jimi Hendrix]], [[Janis Ian]], the [[The Kingston Trio|Kingston Trio]], the [[The Lovin' Spoonful|Lovin' Spoonful]], [[Bette Midler]], [[Liza Minnelli]], [[Joni Mitchell]], [[Maria Muldaur]], [[Laura Nyro]], [[Phil Ochs]], [[Tom Paxton]], [[Peter, Paul, and Mary]], [[Carly Simon]], [[Simon & Garfunkel]], [[Nina Simone]], [[Barbra Streisand]], [[James Taylor]], and the [[The Velvet Underground|Velvet Underground]]. The Greenwich Village of the 1950s and 1960s was at the center of [[Jane Jacobs]]'s book ''[[The Death and Life of Great American Cities]]'', which defended it and similar communities, while criticizing common [[urban renewal]] policies of the time.\n\nFounded by New York-based artist [[Mercedes Matter]] and her students, the [[New York Studio School of Drawing, Painting and Sculpture]] is an art school formed in the mid-1960s in the Village. Officially opened September 23, 1964, the school is still active, at 8 W. 8th Street, the site of the original [[Whitney Museum of American Art]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.nyss.org/schoolhistory.asp |title=New York Studio School of Drawing, Painting and Sculpture: The School: Its History |last1=Matter |first1=Mercedes |date=2002 |website=nyss.org |publisher=New York Studio School |access-date=February 27, 2016 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090426072430/http://www.nyss.org/schoolhistory.asp |archivedate=April 26, 2009}}</ref>\n\nGreenwich Village was home to a safe house used by the radical [[anti-war movement]] known as the [[Weatherman (organization)|Weather Underground]]. On March 6, 1970, their safehouse was destroyed when an explosive device they were constructing was accidentally detonated, killing three of their members ([[Ted Gold]], [[Terry Robbins]], and [[Diana Oughton]]).\n\nThe Village has been a center for movements that challenged the wider American culture, for example, its role in the [[gay liberation]] movement. The [[Stonewall riots]] were a series of spontaneous, violent demonstrations by members of the [[LGBT community|gay community]] against a [[police raid]] that took place in the early morning hours of June 28, 1969, at the [[Stonewall Inn]], 53 [[Christopher Street (Manhattan)|Christopher Street]]. Considered together,  the demonstrations are widely considered to constitute the single most important event leading to the [[gay liberation]] movement and the modern fight for [[LGBT rights in the United States]].<ref>{{cite web |author=National Park Service |title=Workforce Diversity: The Stonewall Inn, National Historic Landmark National Register Number: 99000562 |url=http://www.nps.gov/diversity/stonewall.htm |publisher=US Dept. of Interior |year=2008 |accessdate=July 28, 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.northjersey.com/news/2012_Presidential_Election/Obama_inaugural_speech_references_Stonewall_riots.html |title=Obama inaugural speech references Stonewall gay-rights riots |publisher=North Jersey Media Group |date=January 21, 2013|accessdate=July 28, 2014 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130530065722/http://www.northjersey.com/news/2012_Presidential_Election/Obama_inaugural_speech_references_Stonewall_riots.html |archivedate=May 30, 2013}}</ref> On June 23, 2015, the Stonewall Inn was the first landmark in New York City to be recognized by the [[New York City Landmarks Preservation Commission]] on the basis of its status in LGBT history,<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.northjersey.com/news/nyc-grants-landmark-status-to-gay-rights-movement-building-1.1361241|title=NYC grants landmark status to gay rights movement building|agency=Associated Press|publisher=North Jersey Media Group|date=June 23, 2015|accessdate=June 23, 2015|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160303201003/http://www.northjersey.com/news/nyc-grants-landmark-status-to-gay-rights-movement-building-1.1361241|archivedate=March 3, 2016}}</ref> and on June 24, 2016, the [[Stonewall National Monument]] was named the first [[List of U.S. National Monuments|U.S. National Monument]] dedicated to the LGBTQ-rights movement.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2016/06/25/nyregion/stonewall-inn-named-national-monument-a-first-for-gay-rights-movement.html|title=Stonewall Inn Named National Monument, a First for the Gay Rights Movement|author=Eli Rosenberg|newspaper=The New York Times|date=June 24, 2016|accessdate=June 24, 2016}}</ref> Greenwich Village contains the world's oldest gay and lesbian bookstore, [[Oscar Wilde Bookshop]], founded in 1967, while The Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual & Transgender Community Center \u2013 best known as simply \"The Center\" \u2013 has occupied the former Food & Maritime Trades High School at 208 West 13th Street since 1984.

In the 1960s, [[Margot Gayle]] led a group of citizens to preserve the [[Jefferson Market Courthouse]] (later reused as Jefferson Market Library),<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/09/30/nyregion/30gayle.html|work=The New York Times|title=Margot Gayle, Urban Preservationist and Crusader With Style, Dies at 100|date=September 30, 2008|accessdate=May 4, 2010}}</ref> while other citizen groups fought to keep traffic out of Washington Square Park,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nycgovparks.org/parks/washingtonsquarepark/highlights/9763|author=NYC Dept. of Parks and Recreation|title=Shirley Hayes and the Preservation of Washington Square Park}}</ref> and [[Jane Jacobs]], using the Village as an example of a vibrant urban community, advocated to keep it that way.\n\nSince then, preservation has been a part of the Village ethos. Shortly after the New York City Landmarks Preservation Commission (LPC) was established in 1965, it acted to protect parts of Greenwich Village, designating the small [[Charlton-King-Vandam Historic District]] in 1966, which contains the city's largest concentration of row houses in the Federal style, as well as a significant concentration of Greek Revival houses, and the even smaller [[MacDougal-Sullivan Gardens Historic District]] in 1967, a group of 22 houses sharing a common back garden, built in the Greek Revival style and later renovated with Colonial Revival fa\u00e7ades. In 1969, the LPC designated the Greenwich Village Historic District \u2013 which remained the city's largest for four decades \u2013 despite preservationists' advocacy for the entire neighborhood to be designated an historic district. Advocates continued to pursue their goal of additional designation, spurred in particular by the increased pace of development in the 1990s.\n\n====Rezoned areas====\n[[File:396-397 West Street.jpg|thumb|right|250px|396-397 West Street at West 10th Street is a former hotel which dates from 1904, and is part of the Weehawken Street Historic District]]\nThe [[Greenwich Village Society for Historic Preservation]] (GVSHP), a [[nonprofit organization]] dedicated to the architectural and cultural character and heritage of the neighborhood, successfully proposed new districts and individual landmarks to the LPC.

'''UZI''', sometimes called the '''Uzi 9mm''') is a family of Israeli [[open bolt|open-bolt]], [[blowback (arms)|blowback]]-operated [[submachine gun]]s. Smaller variants are often considered to be [[machine pistol]]s. The Uzi was one of the first weapons to use a [[telescoping bolt]] design which allows the [[magazine (firearms)|magazine]] to be housed in the pistol grip for a shorter weapon.\n\nThe first Uzi submachine gun was designed by Major [[Uziel Gal]] in the late 1940s.  The prototype was finished in 1950. First introduced to [[Israel Defense Forces|IDF]] special forces in 1954, the weapon was placed into general issue two years later. The Uzi has found use as a [[personal defense weapon]] by rear-echelon troops, officers, artillery troops and tankers, as well as a frontline weapon by elite light infantry assault forces.\n\nThe Uzi has been exported to over 90 countries.<ref name=\"mcmanners2003\"/> Over its service lifetime, it has been manufactured by [[Israel Military Industries]], [[FN Herstal]], and other manufacturers. From the 1960s through the 1980s, more Uzi submachine guns were sold to more military, law enforcement and security markets than any other submachine gun ever made.<ref name=\"FF\">{{cite journal | last = Hackathorn| first = Ken | title = Using the Uzi| journal = Fighting Firearms| volume = 3| issue = 1| pages = 18\u201323| publisher = Soldier of Fortune| year = 1995 }}</ref>\n\n== Design ==\nThe Uzi uses an [[open bolt|open-bolt]], [[blowback (arms)|blowback]]-operated design, quite similar to the Jaroslav Hole\u010dek-designed Czech ZK 476 (prototype only)<ref>{{cite web|url= http://www.pmulcahy.com/submachineguns/israeli_submachineguns.htm|title= IMI Uzi|first= Paul|last= Mulcahy|accessdate= 25 November 2012|archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20130120073355/http://pmulcahy.com/submachineguns/israeli_submachineguns.htm|archive-date= 20 January 2013|url-status=live}}</ref> and the production [[Sa vz. 23|Sa 23, Sa 24, Sa 25, and Sa 26]] series of submachine guns. The open bolt design exposes the breech end of the barrel, and improves cooling during periods of continuous fire. However, it means that since the bolt is held to the rear when cocked, the receiver is more susceptible to contamination from sand and dirt. It uses a [[telescoping bolt]] design, in which the bolt wraps around the breech end of the barrel.<ref name=\"IH\">{{cite book | last = Hogg | first = Ian V. | authorlink = Ian V.

With relatively few moving parts, the Uzi is easy to strip for maintenance or repair. The magazine is housed within the pistol grip, allowing for intuitive and easy reloading in dark or difficult conditions, under the principle of \"hand finds hand\".  The pistol grip is fitted with a [[grip safety]], making it difficult to fire accidentally. However, the protruding vertical magazine makes the gun awkward to fire when prone.<ref name=\"IH\"/>  The Uzi features a bayonet lug.<ref name=\"Lewis\">{{cite book |title=The Gun Digest Book of Assault Weapons |last=Lewis |first=Jack |author2=Steele, David E. |authorlink =Jack Lewis (screenwriter) |year=2000 |edition=5th |publisher=Krause Publications |location=Iola, Wis. |isbn=0-87341-778-X |page=222 |oclc=43521989}}</ref>\n\n===Operation===\nThe non-reciprocating charging handle on the top of the receiver cover is used to retract the bolt. Variants have a ratchet safety mechanism which will catch the bolt and lock its movement if it is retracted past the magazine, but not far enough to engage the [[sear (firearm)|sear]]. When the handle is fully retracted to the rear, the bolt will cock (catch) on the sear mechanism and the handle and cover are released to spring fully forward under power of a small spring. The cover will remain forward during firing since it does not reciprocate with the bolt.  The military and police versions will fire immediately upon chambering a cartridge as the Uzi is an open bolt weapon.\n\nThere are two external safety mechanisms on the Uzi. The first is the three-position selector lever located at the top of the grip and behind the trigger group. The rear position is \"S\", or  \"safe\" (S  = Sicher or Secure on the MP2), which locks the sear and prevents movement of the bolt.\n\nThe second external safety mechanism is the grip safety, which is located at the rear of the grip. It is meant to help prevent accidental discharge if the weapon is dropped or the user loses a firm grip on the weapon during firing.\n\nThe trigger mechanism is a conventional firearm trigger, but functions only to control the release mechanism for either the bolt (submachine gun) or firing pin holding mechanism (semi-auto) since the Uzi does not incorporate an internal cocking or hammer mechanism. While the open-bolt system is mechanically simpler than a closed-bolt design (e.g. [[Heckler & Koch MP5]]), it creates a noticeable delay between when the trigger is pulled and when the gun fires.\n\nThe magazine release button or lever is located on the lower portion of the pistol grip and is intended to be manipulated by the non-firing hand. The paddle-like button lies flush with the pistol grip in order to help prevent accidental release of the magazine during rigorous or careless handling.\n\nWhen the gun is de-cocked the ejector port closes, preventing entry of dust and dirt. Though the Uzi's stamped-metal receiver is equipped with pressed reinforcement slots to accept accumulated dirt and sand, the weapon can still jam with heavy accumulations of sand in desert combat conditions when not cleaned regularly.<ref name=\"KD\">{{cite book| last = Dockery| first =Kevin| authorlink=Kevin Dockery (author)|title = Future Weapons| publisher = Berkley Caliber |location=New York | year = 2007| pages = 227\u2013229| isbn = 978-0-425-21750-4 }}</ref> The magazine must be removed prior to de-cocking the weapon.\n\n=== Stocks ===\n[[File:1952 General von Horn IMI Uzi 001 (cropped).jpg|thumb|Uzi with a wooden stock]]\n[[File:UZI Submachine Gun (7414624230).jpg|thumb|Uzi with folding stock]]\n\nThere are different stocks available for the Uzi proper.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Gaboury|first1=David|title=The UZI Submachine Gun Examined|date=3 July 2017|publisher=Andrew Mowbray Publishing, Inc.|isbn=978-1931464765|page=234}}</ref> There is a wooden stock with a metal buttplate that comes in three similar variations that was used by the IDF.

The wooden stocks originally had a quick-release base but the ones sold in the United States have a permanent base to be compliant with US gun laws.\n\nChoate made an aftermarket polymer stock with a rubber buttpad that had a flat butt, a straight comb, and a permanent base.\n\nIn 1956,<ref>{{cite book|last1=Gaboury|first1=David|title=The UZI Submachine Gun Examined|date=3 July 2017|publisher=Andrew Mowbray Publishing, Inc.|isbn=978-1931464765|page=40}}</ref> IMI developed a downward-folding twin-strut metal stock with two swiveling sections that tucks under the rear of the receiver. The Mini Uzi has a forward-folding single-strut metal stock that is actually an inch longer than the Uzi's. Its buttplate can be used as a foregrip when stowed. The Micro Uzi has a similar model.\n\n=== Magazines ===\nThe original box magazines for the 9mm Uzi had a 25-round capacity. Experimental 40- and 50-round extended magazines were tried but were found to be unreliable. A 32-round extended magazine was then tried and was later accepted as standard. The Mini Uzi and Micro Uzi use a shorter 20-round magazine. Available extended magazines include 40-, and 50-round magazines. Other high-capacity aftermarket magazines exist such as the Vector Arms 70-round and Beta Company ([[Beta C-Mag]]) 100-round [[Drum magazine|drums]].\n\nThe .45 ACP Uzi used a 16- or 22-round magazine, while the .45 ACP Micro Uzi and Mini Uzi used a 12-round magazine. A conversion kit by Vector Arms allowed the .45-caliber Uzi to use the same 30-round magazines as the [[M3 submachine gun|M3 \"Grease Gun\"]].<ref name=\"McNab2011\">{{harvnb|McNab|2011|pp=20\u201325}}</ref>\n\n=== Caliber conversions ===\nThe Uzi was available with caliber conversion kits in .22 LR or [[.41 AE]]. The operator just has to change the barrel, bolt and magazine. The .22 LR had 20-round magazines; the original IMI kit used a barrel insert while the aftermarket Action Arms kit used a full replacement barrel. The .41 AE also had a 20-round magazine; since it has the same bolt face as the 9\u00d719mm Parabellum, only the barrel and magazine needed to be changed.<ref name=\"McNab2011\"/>\n\nIMI also manufactured a .45ACP conversion kit both in full auto/open bolt with a 10.2\" barrel for the 9mm SMG and a semi only/closed bolt with a 16\" barrel for the carbine version. Magazine capacity is limited, with 2 sizes of 16 and 10 rds each.\n\n== Operational use ==\n[[File:Soldier Ismailiya.jpg|thumb|alt= A soldier with an Uzi next to a road sign reading \"ISMAILIA 36\"|An Israeli soldier with an Uzi during the Yom Kippur War]]\n[[File:PikiWiki Israel 12768 IDF parade in Jerusalem in 1968.jpg|thumb|Israeli soldiers on parade with Uzis, Jerusalem, 1968]]\nThe Uzi submachine gun was designed by Captain (later Major) [[Uziel Gal]] of the [[Israel Defense Forces]] (IDF) following the [[1948 Arab\u2013Israeli War]]. The weapon was submitted to the Israeli Army for evaluation and won out over more conventional designs due to its simplicity and economy of manufacture. Gal did not want the weapon to be named after him, but his request was ignored. The Uzi was officially adopted in 1951. First introduced to IDF special forces in 1954, the weapon was placed into general issue two years later. The first Uzis were equipped with a short, fixed wooden buttstock, and this is the version that initially saw combat during the 1956 Suez Campaign. Later models would be equipped with a folding metal stock.<ref name=\"KD\" />\n\nThe Uzi was used as a [[personal defense weapon]] by rear-echelon troops, officers, artillery troops and tankers, as well as a frontline weapon by elite light infantry assault forces. The Uzi's compact size and firepower proved instrumental in clearing Syrian bunkers and Jordanian defensive positions during the 1967 [[Six-Day War]].  Though the weapon was phased out of frontline IDF service in the 1980s, some Uzis and Uzi variants were still used by a few IDF units until December 2003, when the IDF announced that it was retiring the Uzi from all IDF forces.<ref name=\"submachine2003\">{{cite news |url=https://www.usatoday.com/news/world/2003-12-18-uzi_x.htm |title=Israel's army phases out country's iconic Uzi submachine gun |work=[[USA Today]] |agency=[[Associated Press]] |date=18 December 2003 |accessdate=6 January 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120204193005/http://www.usatoday.com/news/world/2003-12-18-uzi_x.htm |archive-date=4 February 2012 |url-status=live }}</ref> It was subsequently replaced by the fully automatic [[Micro Tavor]].\n\nIn general, the Uzi was a reliable weapon in military service.  However, even the Uzi fell victim to extreme conditions of sand and dust. During the Sinai Campaign of the [[Yom Kippur War]], IDF Army units reaching the [[Suez Canal]] reported that of all their small arms, only the 7.62&nbsp;mm [[FN MAG]] machine gun was still in operation.<ref name=\"TT\">{{cite book |last=Long |first=Duncan |title=Terrifying Three: Uzi, Ingram and Intratec Weapons Families |publisher=Paladin Press |year=1989 |pages=25\u201331 |location=Boulder, Colo. |isbn=978-0-87364-523-2 |oclc=21678853}}</ref>\n\nThe Uzi proved especially useful for [[mechanized infantry]] needing a compact weapon, and for infantry units clearing [[bunker]]s and other confined spaces.  However, its limited range and accuracy in automatic fire (approximately 50&nbsp;m) could be disconcerting when encountering enemy forces armed with longer-range small arms, and heavier support weapons could not always substitute for a longer-ranged individual weapon. These failings eventually caused the phasing out of the Uzi from IDF front-line assault units .<ref name=\"submachine2003\" />\n\nThe Uzi has been used in various conflicts outside Israel and the Middle East during the 1960s and 1970s.  Quantities of 9&nbsp;mm Uzi submachine guns were used by Portuguese cavalry, police, and security forces during the [[Portuguese Colonial Wars]] in Africa.<ref name=\"KD\" />\n\n== Worldwide sales ==\n[[File:Reagan assassination attempt 4 crop.jpg|thumb|right|Secret Service agents cover [[James Brady|Press Secretary James Brady]] and police officer [[Thomas Delahanty]] during the [[Attempted assassination of Ronald Reagan|assassination attempt]] of [[Ronald Reagan|President Ronald Reagan]] by [[John Hinckley Jr.]] on March 30, 1981.

It was the first country other than Israel to use it as a service weapon. Their models are distinct in that they have a wooden stock made to their specifications that is more angular, had an angled butt and a curved comb, and is 2 inches longer than the IDF model.\n* The German [[Bundeswehr]] (especially its tank crews) used the Uzi since 1959 under the designation MP2. It replaced the [[Beretta Model 38|MP1 (Beretta M1938/49)]] and [[Thompson M1]] in service. The MP2 was fitted with the IDF-style wooden stock and the later MP2A1 was fitted with the metal folding stock. It can be recognized by its distinctive three-position \"DES\" selector switch: \"D\"  for \"''Dauerfeuer''\" (\"continuous-fire\", or \"automatic\"), \"E\" for \"''Einzelfeuer''\" (\"single-fire\", or \"semi-automatic\"), and \"S\"  for \"''Sicher''\" (\"secure\", or \"safe\"). The Bundeswehr relegated it to reserve use after adopting the [[Heckler & Koch MP5]] in 1985. It was replaced with the [[Heckler & Koch MP7]] Personal Defense Weapon in 2007.\n* The [[Belgian Armed Forces]] have used Uzi machine pistols in [[9mm Parabellum Bullet|9mm]], [[.45 ACP]] and [[22 Long Rifle|22LR]] calibres, license-made by [[FN Herstal]] from 1958 to 1971.

A small number of Uzi carbines were produced with the standard length barrel for special markets. It fires from a closed-bolt position in semi-automatic mode only and uses a floating firing pin as opposed to a fixed firing pin.<ref name=\"TT\"/> The FS-style selector switch has two positions (the automatic setting was blocked): \"F\" for \"fire\" (semi-auto) and \"S\" for \"safe\". Uzi carbines are available in calibers .22LR, 9mm, .41 AE, and .45 ACP.\n\nThe Uzi carbine has two main variants, the Model A (imported from 1980 to 1983) and the Model B (imported from 1983 until 1989).

Smaller variants are often considered to be [[machine pistol]]s. The Uzi was one of the first weapons to use a [[telescoping bolt]] design which allows the [[magazine (firearms)|magazine]] to be housed in the pistol grip for a shorter weapon.\n\nThe first Uzi submachine gun was designed by Major [[Uziel Gal]] in the late 1940s.  The prototype was finished in 1950. First introduced to [[Israel Defense Forces|IDF]] special forces in 1954, the weapon was placed into general issue two years later. The Uzi has found use as a [[personal defense weapon]] by rear-echelon troops, officers, artillery troops and tankers, as well as a frontline weapon by elite light infantry assault forces.\n\nThe Uzi has been exported to over 90 countries.<ref name=\"mcmanners2003\"/> Over its service lifetime, it has been manufactured by [[Israel Military Industries]], [[FN Herstal]], and other manufacturers. From the 1960s through the 1980s, more Uzi submachine guns were sold to more military, law enforcement and security markets than any other submachine gun ever made.<ref name=\"FF\">{{cite journal | last = Hackathorn| first = Ken | title = Using the Uzi| journal = Fighting Firearms| volume = 3| issue = 1| pages = 18\u201323| publisher = Soldier of Fortune| year = 1995 }}</ref>\n\n== Design ==\nThe Uzi uses an [[open bolt|open-bolt]], [[blowback (arms)|blowback]]-operated design, quite similar to the Jaroslav Hole\u010dek-designed Czech ZK 476 (prototype only)<ref>{{cite web|url= http://www.pmulcahy.com/submachineguns/israeli_submachineguns.htm|title= IMI Uzi|first= Paul|last= Mulcahy|accessdate= 25 November 2012|archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20130120073355/http://pmulcahy.com/submachineguns/israeli_submachineguns.htm|archive-date= 20 January 2013|url-status=live}}</ref> and the production [[Sa vz. 23|Sa 23, Sa 24, Sa 25, and Sa 26]] series of submachine guns. The open bolt design exposes the breech end of the barrel, and improves cooling during periods of continuous fire. However, it means that since the bolt is held to the rear when cocked, the receiver is more susceptible to contamination from sand and dirt. It uses a [[telescoping bolt]] design, in which the bolt wraps around the breech end of the barrel.<ref name=\"IH\">{{cite book | last = Hogg | first = Ian V. | authorlink = Ian V.

With relatively few moving parts, the Uzi is easy to strip for maintenance or repair. The magazine is housed within the pistol grip, allowing for intuitive and easy reloading in dark or difficult conditions, under the principle of \"hand finds hand\".  The pistol grip is fitted with a [[grip safety]], making it difficult to fire accidentally. However, the protruding vertical magazine makes the gun awkward to fire when prone.<ref name=\"IH\"/>  The Uzi features a bayonet lug.<ref name=\"Lewis\">{{cite book |title=The Gun Digest Book of Assault Weapons |last=Lewis |first=Jack |author2=Steele, David E. |authorlink =Jack Lewis (screenwriter) |year=2000 |edition=5th |publisher=Krause Publications |location=Iola, Wis. |isbn=0-87341-778-X |page=222 |oclc=43521989}}</ref>\n\n===Operation===\nThe non-reciprocating charging handle on the top of the receiver cover is used to retract the bolt. Variants have a ratchet safety mechanism which will catch the bolt and lock its movement if it is retracted past the magazine, but not far enough to engage the [[sear (firearm)|sear]]. When the handle is fully retracted to the rear, the bolt will cock (catch) on the sear mechanism and the handle and cover are released to spring fully forward under power of a small spring. The cover will remain forward during firing since it does not reciprocate with the bolt.  The military and police versions will fire immediately upon chambering a cartridge as the Uzi is an open bolt weapon.\n\nThere are two external safety mechanisms on the Uzi. The first is the three-position selector lever located at the top of the grip and behind the trigger group. The rear position is \"S\", or  \"safe\" (S  = Sicher or Secure on the MP2), which locks the sear and prevents movement of the bolt.\n\nThe second external safety mechanism is the grip safety, which is located at the rear of the grip. It is meant to help prevent accidental discharge if the weapon is dropped or the user loses a firm grip on the weapon during firing.\n\nThe trigger mechanism is a conventional firearm trigger, but functions only to control the release mechanism for either the bolt (submachine gun) or firing pin holding mechanism (semi-auto) since the Uzi does not incorporate an internal cocking or hammer mechanism. While the open-bolt system is mechanically simpler than a closed-bolt design (e.g. [[Heckler & Koch MP5]]), it creates a noticeable delay between when the trigger is pulled and when the gun fires.\n\nThe magazine release button or lever is located on the lower portion of the pistol grip and is intended to be manipulated by the non-firing hand. The paddle-like button lies flush with the pistol grip in order to help prevent accidental release of the magazine during rigorous or careless handling.\n\nWhen the gun is de-cocked the ejector port closes, preventing entry of dust and dirt. Though the Uzi's stamped-metal receiver is equipped with pressed reinforcement slots to accept accumulated dirt and sand, the weapon can still jam with heavy accumulations of sand in desert combat conditions when not cleaned regularly.<ref name=\"KD\">{{cite book| last = Dockery| first =Kevin| authorlink=Kevin Dockery (author)|title = Future Weapons| publisher = Berkley Caliber |location=New York | year = 2007| pages = 227\u2013229| isbn = 978-0-425-21750-4 }}</ref> The magazine must be removed prior to de-cocking the weapon.\n\n=== Stocks ===\n[[File:1952 General von Horn IMI Uzi 001 (cropped).jpg|thumb|Uzi with a wooden stock]]\n[[File:UZI Submachine Gun (7414624230).jpg|thumb|Uzi with folding stock]]\n\nThere are different stocks available for the Uzi proper.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Gaboury|first1=David|title=The UZI Submachine Gun Examined|date=3 July 2017|publisher=Andrew Mowbray Publishing, Inc.|isbn=978-1931464765|page=234}}</ref> There is a wooden stock with a metal buttplate that comes in three similar variations that was used by the IDF. The first version had a flat butt and straight [[Stock (firearms)#Comb|comb]] and had hollows for a cleaning rod and gun oil bottle. The second had an angled butt and a straight comb and no hollows. The third had an angled butt and curved comb and no hollows; a polymer version is currently available from IMI. The wooden stocks originally had a quick-release base but the ones sold in the United States have a permanent base to be compliant with US gun laws.\n\nChoate made an aftermarket polymer stock with a rubber buttpad that had a flat butt, a straight comb, and a permanent base.\n\nIn 1956,<ref>{{cite book|last1=Gaboury|first1=David|title=The UZI Submachine Gun Examined|date=3 July 2017|publisher=Andrew Mowbray Publishing, Inc.|isbn=978-1931464765|page=40}}</ref> IMI developed a downward-folding twin-strut metal stock with two swiveling sections that tucks under the rear of the receiver. The Mini Uzi has a forward-folding single-strut metal stock that is actually an inch longer than the Uzi's. Its buttplate can be used as a foregrip when stowed. The Micro Uzi has a similar model.\n\n=== Magazines ===\nThe original box magazines for the 9mm Uzi had a 25-round capacity. Experimental 40- and 50-round extended magazines were tried but were found to be unreliable. A 32-round extended magazine was then tried and was later accepted as standard. The Mini Uzi and Micro Uzi use a shorter 20-round magazine. Available extended magazines include 40-, and 50-round magazines. Other high-capacity aftermarket magazines exist such as the Vector Arms 70-round and Beta Company ([[Beta C-Mag]]) 100-round [[Drum magazine|drums]].\n\nThe .45 ACP Uzi used a 16- or 22-round magazine, while the .45 ACP Micro Uzi and Mini Uzi used a 12-round magazine. A conversion kit by Vector Arms allowed the .45-caliber Uzi to use the same 30-round magazines as the [[M3 submachine gun|M3 \"Grease Gun\"]].<ref name=\"McNab2011\">{{harvnb|McNab|2011|pp=20\u201325}}</ref>\n\n=== Caliber conversions ===\nThe Uzi was available with caliber conversion kits in .22 LR or [[.41 AE]]. The operator just has to change the barrel, bolt and magazine. The .22 LR had 20-round magazines; the original IMI kit used a barrel insert while the aftermarket Action Arms kit used a full replacement barrel. The .41 AE also had a 20-round magazine; since it has the same bolt face as the 9\u00d719mm Parabellum, only the barrel and magazine needed to be changed.<ref name=\"McNab2011\"/>\n\nIMI also manufactured a .45ACP conversion kit both in full auto/open bolt with a 10.2\" barrel for the 9mm SMG and a semi only/closed bolt with a 16\" barrel for the carbine version. Magazine capacity is limited, with 2 sizes of 16 and 10 rds each.\n\n== Operational use ==\n[[File:Soldier Ismailiya.jpg|thumb|alt= A soldier with an Uzi next to a road sign reading \"ISMAILIA 36\"|An Israeli soldier with an Uzi during the Yom Kippur War]]\n[[File:PikiWiki Israel 12768 IDF parade in Jerusalem in 1968.jpg|thumb|Israeli soldiers on parade with Uzis, Jerusalem, 1968]]\nThe Uzi submachine gun was designed by Captain (later Major) [[Uziel Gal]] of the [[Israel Defense Forces]] (IDF) following the [[1948 Arab\u2013Israeli War]]. The weapon was submitted to the Israeli Army for evaluation and won out over more conventional designs due to its simplicity and economy of manufacture. Gal did not want the weapon to be named after him, but his request was ignored. The Uzi was officially adopted in 1951. First introduced to IDF special forces in 1954, the weapon was placed into general issue two years later. The first Uzis were equipped with a short, fixed wooden buttstock, and this is the version that initially saw combat during the 1956 Suez Campaign. Later models would be equipped with a folding metal stock.<ref name=\"KD\" />\n\nThe Uzi was used as a [[personal defense weapon]] by rear-echelon troops, officers, artillery troops and tankers, as well as a frontline weapon by elite light infantry assault forces. The Uzi's compact size and firepower proved instrumental in clearing Syrian bunkers and Jordanian defensive positions during the 1967 [[Six-Day War]].  Though the weapon was phased out of frontline IDF service in the 1980s, some Uzis and Uzi variants were still used by a few IDF units until December 2003, when the IDF announced that it was retiring the Uzi from all IDF forces.<ref name=\"submachine2003\">{{cite news |url=https://www.usatoday.com/news/world/2003-12-18-uzi_x.htm |title=Israel's army phases out country's iconic Uzi submachine gun |work=[[USA Today]] |agency=[[Associated Press]] |date=18 December 2003 |accessdate=6 January 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120204193005/http://www.usatoday.com/news/world/2003-12-18-uzi_x.htm |archive-date=4 February 2012 |url-status=live }}</ref> It was subsequently replaced by the fully automatic [[Micro Tavor]].\n\nIn general, the Uzi was a reliable weapon in military service.  However, even the Uzi fell victim to extreme conditions of sand and dust. During the Sinai Campaign of the [[Yom Kippur War]], IDF Army units reaching the [[Suez Canal]] reported that of all their small arms, only the 7.62&nbsp;mm [[FN MAG]] machine gun was still in operation.<ref name=\"TT\">{{cite book |last=Long |first=Duncan |title=Terrifying Three: Uzi, Ingram and Intratec Weapons Families |publisher=Paladin Press |year=1989 |pages=25\u201331 |location=Boulder, Colo. |isbn=978-0-87364-523-2 |oclc=21678853}}</ref>\n\nThe Uzi proved especially useful for [[mechanized infantry]] needing a compact weapon, and for infantry units clearing [[bunker]]s and other confined spaces.  However, its limited range and accuracy in automatic fire (approximately 50&nbsp;m) could be disconcerting when encountering enemy forces armed with longer-range small arms, and heavier support weapons could not always substitute for a longer-ranged individual weapon. These failings eventually caused the phasing out of the Uzi from IDF front-line assault units .<ref name=\"submachine2003\" />\n\nThe Uzi has been used in various conflicts outside Israel and the Middle East during the 1960s and 1970s.

It was the first country other than Israel to use it as a service weapon. Their models are distinct in that they have a wooden stock made to their specifications that is more angular, had an angled butt and a curved comb, and is 2 inches longer than the IDF model.\n* The German [[Bundeswehr]] (especially its tank crews) used the Uzi since 1959 under the designation MP2. It replaced the [[Beretta Model 38|MP1 (Beretta M1938/49)]] and [[Thompson M1]] in service. The MP2 was fitted with the IDF-style wooden stock and the later MP2A1 was fitted with the metal folding stock. It can be recognized by its distinctive three-position \"DES\" selector switch: \"D\"  for \"''Dauerfeuer''\" (\"continuous-fire\", or \"automatic\"), \"E\" for \"''Einzelfeuer''\" (\"single-fire\", or \"semi-automatic\"), and \"S\"  for \"''Sicher''\" (\"secure\", or \"safe\"). The Bundeswehr relegated it to reserve use after adopting the [[Heckler & Koch MP5]] in 1985. It was replaced with the [[Heckler & Koch MP7]] Personal Defense Weapon in 2007.\n* The [[Belgian Armed Forces]] have used Uzi machine pistols in [[9mm Parabellum Bullet|9mm]], [[.45 ACP]] and [[22 Long Rifle|22LR]] calibres, license-made by [[FN Herstal]] from 1958 to 1971.

A small number of Uzi carbines were produced with the standard length barrel for special markets. It fires from a closed-bolt position in semi-automatic mode only and uses a floating firing pin as opposed to a fixed firing pin.<ref name=\"TT\"/> The FS-style selector switch has two positions (the automatic setting was blocked): \"F\" for \"fire\" (semi-auto) and \"S\" for \"safe\". Uzi carbines are available in calibers .22LR, 9mm, .41 AE, and .45 ACP.\n\nThe Uzi carbine has two main variants, the Model A (imported from 1980 to 1983) and the Model B (imported from 1983 until 1989). The Type A was the same as the fully automatic Uzi, while the Type B had a firing pin safety and improved sights and sling swivels. These two variants were imported and distributed by [[Action Arms]].<ref name=\"TT\"/>\n\nThe American firm Group Industries made limited numbers of a copy of the Uzi \"B\" model semiauto carbine for sale in the US along with copies of the Uzi submachine gun for the U.S. collectors' market.

He was also noted as a prominent [[atheist]], [[Nationalism|nationalist]] and opponent of [[eugenics]]. In the early 1920s, after the death of his wife, he turned towards [[spiritualism]].\n\n==Early life==\nRobert Blatchford was born 17 March 1851 in [[Maidstone]], [[Kent]]. His parents \u2013 John Glanville Blatchford, a strolling comedian, and Georgina Louisa Corri ''(maiden;'' 1821\u20131890), an actress \u2013 named him after the conservative [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom|Prime Minister]] [[Robert Peel]] who died the year before. His great-grandfather, by way of his mother, [[Domenico Corri]] (1746\u20131825), was an Italian musician and publisher who, in the late [[18th century]], moved from [[Rome]] to [[Edinburgh]] to teach music.<ref name=\"ODNB\" /> One of his grandnieces, [[Christine Glanville]] (1924\u20131999), was an acclaimed English puppeteer.\n\nBlatchford's father died in 1853, leaving him in the care of his mother. She continued her acting career for nine years, and Blatchford spent much of his early life close to the stage. To help support the family, Blatchford and his brother Montagu would perform with their mother, doing comedic renditions and dances for extra income. In 1862 the family moved to [[Halifax, West Yorkshire|Halifax]], where it was hoped that Blatchford and his brother could learn a trade. Blatchford was first employed as an odd job boy in a lithographic printing works, for which he earned a salary of eighteen pence a week. As a child he attended school only occasionally, firstly in Halifax and later in Portsmouth. Despite the brevity of his educational experience, it provided him with enough insight that he called the education system a 'cram' method.\n\nThough lacking a formal education, Blatchford taught himself from the age of eight, reading the [[Bible]], ''[[Pilgrim's Progress]]'', and the works of [[Charles Dickens]]. Throughout his childhood he was frail and sickly, and doctors suggested that he would not reach adulthood. This illness gave Blatchford time to read, something he would not have been able to pursue as thoroughly if employed. Around 1864, Georgina secured full-time employment as a dressmaker and immediately apprenticed both her sons, sending Montagu to a lithographic printer and Robert to a brushmaker. At the brushmaker factory, Blatchford met Sarah Crossley, who he would marry in 1880.\n\nBy 1871 Blatchford left Halifax, though his reason for doing so has been the cause of debate. Laurence Thomson argues that the departure was due to a quarrel with his mother, but Blatchford's daughter Dorothea maintains that his decision to leave was caused by the difficulty of his life in Halifax. On [[May Day]] 1871, Blatchford walked to Hull, then continued on to London via Yarmouth.\n\n==Military and early journalistic career==\nAfter leaving Halifax, Blatchford joined the [[British Army|Army]] and rose to become a [[sergeant major]] by 1874. By the time of his promotion, he had also achieved the Army's second class certificate of education. Blatchford served with the Irish regiment 103rd [[Royal Dublin Fusiliers|Dublin Fusiliers]] and the [[96th Regiment of Foot]]. The pleasures of army life stimulated some of Blatchford's best writing, but in 1877 he left the army to become a clerk in the [[River Weaver|Weaver Navigation Company]]. While employed as a clerk, he carefully used his spare time to learn grammar, syntax, and shorthand. In 1880 he married Sarah Crossley, whom he met in Halifax, at the Zion Chapel in Halifax; they then settled in [[Norwich]]. Sarah was the daughter of a [[domestic worker|domestic servant]] and a mechanic. Around this time Blatchford became frustrated with his job, and decided that he wished to become an artist. Because employment opportunities for artists in Norwich were scarce, however, he instead decided to become a writer. Blatchford's writing career began in 1882 at the ''Yorkshireman'' newspaper, where he had a sketch published. He obtained his first full-time writing job through his friend Alexander Muttock Thompson, who worked for the Manchester ''[[Sporting Chronicle]]''. Thompson recommended Blatchford to a friend who ran the newspaper ''[[Bell's Life in London]]''. A year later, Blatchford moved his family to South London to write for ''Bell's Life'' and the ''Leeds Toby''.\n\nIn 1885, Blatchford began to write for the Manchester ''[[Sunday Chronicle]]''. When ''Bell's Life'' failed two years later, he moved to a full-time position at the ''Sunday Chronicle''. Before beginning at the ''Sunday Chronicle'', Blatchford took a short holiday on the Isle of Wight after the death of his two children. At this time he had not begun to espouse socialist views, but the societal reactions to the competitiveness of industrial society in Northern England began affecting his sentiments. The largest political influence on Blatchford was the South [[Salford, Greater Manchester|Salford]] [[Social Democratic Federation]]. This change is seen in a series of 1889 articles he wrote for the ''Sunday Chronicle'' which denounced the housing conditions in Manchester and organised two working men's Sanitary Organisations in the area.\n\nReflecting back on this period, Blatchford stated in the ''Fortnightly Review'' in 1907 that \"Dr. Cozier is mistaken if he thinks I took my Socialism from [[Karl Marx|Marx]], or that it depends upon the Marxian theory of value. I have never read a page of Marx. I got the idea of collective ownership from [[Henry Hyndman|H. M. Hyndman]]; the rest of my Socialism I thought out myself. English Socialism is not German: it is English. English Socialism is not Marxian; it is humanitarian. It does not depend upon any theory of 'economic justice' but upon humanity and common sense.\"\n\n==''The Clarion''==\nIn 1890, while based in [[Manchester]], Blatchford became actively involved in the Labour Movement. He founded the Manchester branch of the [[Fabian Society]], and launched a weekly socialist newspaper, ''[[The Clarion]]'', in 1891. Later that year, he used his column to announce that he had accepted the invitation of the [[Bradford Labour Union]] to become the Independent Labour candidate in [[Bradford East (UK Parliament constituency)|Bradford East]]. However, his socialist stance forced him to leave the ''[[Sunday Chronicle]],'' which in turn left him with a severe reduction in income.\n\nHaving left the newspaper on 12 December 1891, Blatchford set up ''The Clarion'', but a printing error made its first edition was almost completely illegible.{{citation needed|date=July 2011}} Nevertheless, it still sold at least 40,000 copies. It continued to sell this number and more during the following years. By 1910 it was selling about 80,000 copies of each issue. [[Bernard Semmel]] described it as \"the most successful socialist publication in Great Britain during the period before the war of 1914\".<ref>Semmel, p. 214.</ref>\n\nBy 1892 Blatchford had removed himself from the candidature in Bradford East and began siding with the [[Social Democratic Federation]] (SDF) against the Fabians' policy of \"permeation.\" The joining of ''The Clarion'' and SDF resulted in the formation in 1892 of the Manchester Independent Labour Party, which soon devised the Manchester Fourth Clause. By 1893 Blatchford was the leader of his own clique within the newly founded national [[Independent Labour Party]], the Clarionettes, whose extraordinary dynamism was expressed in its numerous choral societies, [[National Clarion Cycling Club|''Clarion'' cycling clubs]], Socialist Scouts, and glee clubs.\n\nCentral to the ''Clarion'' movement were the ''Clarion'' cycling clubs, whose members, frequently accompanied by the \"''Clarion'' Van\", travelled the country distributing socialist literature and holding mass meetings. [[Robert Tressell]]'s socialist novel ''[[The Ragged Trousered Philanthropists]]'' contains a detailed account based on a meeting organised by the [[National Clarion Cycling Club#Clarion Scouts|''Clarion'' scouts]].\n\nThe ''Clarion'' movement also supported many industrial disputes at this time, including the three-year lockout of the slateworkers of the [[Penrhyn Quarry|Penrhyn]] [[Slate industry|slate quarry]] in North [[Wales]]. ''The Clarion'' collected \u00a31,500 to support the people of [[Bethesda, Wales|Bethesda]].\n\nThere was a revolt in the county federation created by the ILP in 1894, as Blatchford urged the formation of a united socialist party. In the same year he resigned from the editorship of ''The Clarion'' due to ill health and developed depression. He started to edit it again in 1896. He supported the [[Second Boer War|Boer War]], which lost him support from some sections of the labour movement. Blatchford denounced his \"cosmopolitan friends, who are so cosmopolitan that they can admire every country but their own, and love all men except Englishmen\".<ref name=\"Semmel, p. 217\">Semmel, p. 217.</ref> He criticised the \"smug, self-righteous prigs\" in the labour movement who, while \"despising military glory, are yet so eloquent over the marksmanship and courage of the Boers\".<ref name=\"Semmel, p. 217\"/> He wrote that his \"whole heart is with the British troops ... When England is at war, I'm English. I have no politics and no party. I am English.\"<ref name=\"Semmel, p. 218\">Semmel, p. 218.</ref>  Responding to claims from the right-wing press that he wanted to \u2018turn people against their country\u2019, he retorted that he wanted \u2018to make people so fond of their country that they shall desire to possess it\u2019.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Swift|first=David|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.5949/liverpool/9781786940025.001.0001|title=For Class and Country|date=2017-11-01|publisher=Liverpool University Press|isbn=978-1-78694-002-5}}</ref>\n\nAfter the war Blatchford continued to agitate for a united socialist party and supported the London Progressive Party. He was critical of the [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]], which was founded in 1900, for what he perceived as its complete subservience to Liberalism, especially in its [[Cobdenism|Cobdenite]] internationalist views on foreign policy.<ref>Semmel, p. 215.</ref> Blatchford said of himself and his colleagues at ''The Clarion'': \"We were out for Socialism and nothing but Socialism, and we were Britons first and Socialists next.\"<ref>Blatchford, p. 199.</ref>\n\nBlatchford criticised free trade from an economic nationalist perspective. Free trade had made it impossible for Britain to feed herself and had destroyed British agriculture. This was especially serious in wartime because Britain could be starved into submission due to the dependence for her food on foreign nations.<ref name=\"Semmel, p. 218\"/> When [[Joseph Chamberlain]] launched his crusade for [[Tariff Reform League|Tariff Reform]] in 1903, Blatchford's response was ambiguous. He did not formally endorse Chamberlain's campaign, but ''The Clarion'' praised his aims\u2014the revival of British agriculture, a self-sufficient Empire, and producer-focused instead of consumer-focused economic system.<ref>Semmel, p. 219.</ref> Blatchford said he did not believe in tariff reform as applied by [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservatives]], but that a socialist government would find it a necessary instrument.<ref>Semmel, p. 220.</ref>\n \nA further development in Blatchford's thinking cost him further readers, when he began denouncing organised religion in such works as ''God and My Neighbour'' in 1903 and \u2018Not Guilty: A Defence of the Bottom Dog\u2019 1905. Again, to antagonise the ILP, the ''Clarion'' raised funds for Victor Grayson, whom the ILP had declined to support. He justified his attacks as being because Labour was too close to the Liberals.\n\n==''Merrie England''==\n{{main|Merrie England (Robert Blatchford book)|l1=Merrie England}}\nA series of articles on socialism in ''The Clarion'' were published in book form in 1893 as ''Merrie England''. The first edition sold 30,000 copies. The year after, a pocket-sized edition was published, which sold 25,000 copies.<ref>Thompson, p. 98.</ref> A penny edition was published in 1894, with 250,000 copies being ordered before publication and within a year 750,000 copies had been despatched across the English speaking world.<ref>Thompson, p. 99.</ref> In Britain and America, the book sold over two million copies. In the opinion of [[Robert Ensor]], the book \"helped to make socialism really well known in England for the first time...It was Blatchford's highest flight as a propagandist; he never surpassed it, and through it mainly he left his mark upon history\".<ref name=\"ODNB\">R.

The motion was seconded by [[Hilaire Belloc]].<ref>Thompson, pp. 100-101.</ref>\n\nBlatchford was a [[Vegetarianism|vegetarian]] and in ''Merrie England'' he mentioned the economic, health and humanitarian benefits of a vegetarian diet.<ref>Li, Chien-hui.

ISBN 978-1-137-52650-2</ref>\n\n==War scare of 1909==\nAt the end of the second week of December 1909, Blatchford wrote ten daily articles for the ''[[Daily Mail]]'' warning of the German menace:\n\n<blockquote>I write these articles because I believe that Germany is deliberately preparing to destroy the British Empire; and because I know that we are not ready or able to defend ourselves against a sudden and formidable attack...At the present moment the whole country is in a ferment about the Budget and the Peers and the Election. It seems sheer criminal lunacy to waste time and strength in chasing such political bubble when the existence of the Empire is threatened.<ref name=\"Morris, p. 213\">Morris, p. 213.</ref></blockquote>\n\nThe articles received considerable attention in Britain and Germany, and when published as a pamphlet sold over one and a half million copies.<ref name=\"Morris, p. 213\"/> The [[Edward VII|King]] \"lamented Blatchford's violence\"<ref>Morris, p. 213</ref> and the [[Wilhelm II, German Emperor|Kaiser]] read Blatchford's articles with care and denounced them as \"very mischievous and singularly ill-timed\".<ref>Morris, p. 423, p. 219.</ref> Sir [[Charles Ottley]], the Secretary to the Committee of Imperial Defence, wrote to [[Reginald Brett, 2nd Viscount Esher|Lord Esher]] that Blatchford's appeal was not based on a partisan, political basis as he had said that the country did not want a Liberal or Unionist government but a MAN: \"His strength is that he knows what he wants and is not afraid to ask for it in plain language...The burthen of the song is\u2014compulsory service, a strong navy and a general raising of the standard of education and living of the masses of the British people\".<ref name=\"Morris, p. 214\">Morris, p. 214.</ref> [[Evelyn Baring, 1st Earl of Cromer|Lord Cromer]] publicly declared that he shared Blatchford's patriotism.<ref>Morris, p. 216.</ref> The articles ensured that defence was a major issue in the ensuing [[January 1910 United Kingdom general election|general election of January 1910]].<ref>Morris, p. 215.</ref> After the election the Liberal MP [[Reginald McKenna]] boasted that Blatchford had not cost the Liberals a single vote.<ref>Blatchford, p. 224.</ref><ref name=\"Thompson, p. 216\">Thompson, p. 216.</ref> Keir Hardie said that \"the whole Socialist movement was rocking with suppressed laughter\".<ref>Blatchford, p. 225.</ref>\n\nThe ''Daily Mail''\u2032s Berlin correspondent told [[Alfred Harmsworth, 1st Viscount Northcliffe|Lord Northcliffe]]: \"In a long experience...I do not recall a foreign journalistic event which so focussed the attention of the German press and public\".<ref name=\"Morris, p. 214\"/> There was universal condemnation in German newspapers, including Social Democratic, Catholic and Pan-German organs. When the German Chancellor [[Theobald von Bethmann-Hollweg]] complained to [[Edward Goschen]], the British ambassador in Berlin, the Foreign Secretary Sir [[Edward Grey, 1st Viscount Grey of Fallodon|Edward Grey]] advised Goschen to explain the articles as \"not really anti-German but alarmist...to create a scare\".<ref name=\"Morris, p. 214\"/>\n\nShortly before the [[December 1910 United Kingdom general election|general election of December 1910]], the ''Daily Mail'' published Blatchford's series of articles on \u2018The Greatest Issue of All\u2019, the German threat. However these were nowhere near as influential as his previous ones and defence was not an issue in the election.<ref>Morris, p. 221.</ref>\n\nIn 1909 he began advocating conscription but in 1912 troops were used for strike breaking and Blatchford turned against it: \"Universal military service under the (present) ruling classes would result in slavery. I regard invasion as the lesser evil\". However he supported conscription again in 1915, and proclaimed it should be implemented along with the \"conscription of wealth\".<ref>Thompson, p. 215 + n.</ref> Before the Great War, Blatchford toured Germany and after he returned to England he wrote:\n\n<blockquote>I am convinced that...they will be plunged into war without their will. I like Germany; I like German cities; and I like the German people. But I believe that the rulers of the German people are deliberately and cynically preparing to hurl them into a wicked and a desperate war of conquest...The Germans cannot prevent that war, because they do not believe it is coming. The British could prevent that war if, before it is too late, they could be really convinced that it is coming. That is why I want to convince them that war is coming, because I want to prevent that horrible war.<ref>Thompson, p. 213.</ref></blockquote>\n\nBlatchford was impressed by the cleanliness and efficiency in Germany: \"You don't see anything like that in Germany. I thought to myself, is this how we are preparing to fight for the existence of our Empire? What use will these ragged, famished spectres be when we have our backs to the wall?\"<ref>Thompson, p. 214.</ref>\n\n==Later life==\nOn 4 August 1914, Blatchford wrote to his friend [[Alexander M. Thompson|Alexander Thompson]]: \"I shall write today a cautious article counselling peace and suggesting that Sir [[Edward Grey, 1st Viscount Grey of Fallodon|E. Grey]] should ask Russia and Germany to suspend hostilities pending a friendly mediation by America, England and Italy, or any one of those powers. But I do not think really that European peace is possible until Germany has been defeated and humiliated. And I realise the great possibility that we shall be at war with Germany before the ''Clarion'' comes out. And I hope we are\".<ref>Thompson, pp. 222\u2013223.</ref> The Clarion Movement was split when Blatchford swung his paper in support of the British participation in the [[First World War]]. The circulation for ''The Clarion'' fell by 10,000 in a week but when in September 1914 Blatchford wrote a page of ''The Weekly Dispatch'' every Sunday its circulation rose by 50,000.<ref name=\"Thompson, p. 223\">Thompson, p. 223.</ref> In his first article for that paper, Blatchford correctly predicted that the German Army would not reach Paris and of General Joffre's flank along the Marne.<ref name=\"Thompson, p. 223\"/>\n\nBlatchford visited France in October 1914 and was shocked by the conduct of the Germans in waging war. Initially warning his readers of fake atrocity stories, Blatchford was shocked by the ruined villages in France and the stories he heard, \"too horrible and too unclean to be revealed in print\". He wrote to Thompson in 1933: \"In the early days of the war the movement howled with indignation about the lying charges brought against the German General Staff and troops. The noble Germans were incapable of such crimes. British and Belgian and American witnesses were all liars. Today the same intelligent comrades are denouncing the atrocities committed by the Nazi 'storm troops' upon innocent and helpless Jews. Well, old pal, may I suggest that if the Germans of today are guilty perhaps the Huns of 1914 were not quite innocent\".<ref name=\"Thompson, p. 223\"/>\n\nIn his articles during the war, Blatchford campaigned for better pay for the soldiers and considerable pensions for disabled soldiers, soldiers' widows and children.<ref>Thompson, p. 224, p. 226.</ref> When a soldier wrote to him, claiming his opinions would not be accepted by the Army but those of [[Philip Snowden]] and [[Ramsay MacDonald]] would, Blatchford replied: \"I am sorry. I cannot help it. You want peace. But you cannot have peace without victory...The struggle with Germany will not end with the present war, and we may some day have to fight Germany single-handed\".<ref>Thompson, p. 226.</ref>\n\nIn 1915, Blatchford formed the [[National Democratic and Labour Party]] (NDP) as a splinter from the right wing of the [[British Socialist Party]] and for the [[1918 United Kingdom general election|1918 General Election]], the NDP stood in 18 constituencies and won 9 [[Member of parliament|members of Parliament]] with 156,834 votes. It thereby became the first party formed by a right-wing split from the Labour party in Britain to win seats in Parliament at a general election.\n\nBlatchford's wife died in 1921, and later he took an interest in Spiritualism. In 1923 he wrote in response to claims in the press that he had been converted away from socialism by reading [[Henry Ford]]'s autobiography:\n\n<blockquote>I have never been converted from Socialism. But careful observation of the facts of for the last twelve years or so has convinced me that Socialism will not work, and a study of Mr. Ford's methods has provided what seems to me as good a substitute as we may hope in this imperfect world. Socialism as I knew it in past years was an excellent, almost a perfect, theory...The [[golden rule]] will not work in international politics, because the nations are not good enough to live up to it. Real Socialism strongly resembles real Christianity. It is a counsel of perfection and cannot be adopted and adhered to by our imperfect humanity. There is nothing the matter with Socialism, but the people are neither wise enough nor good enough to make it a success. Socialism implies the self-abnegation of the individual for the good of the community.<ref>Thompson, pp. 229\u2013230.</ref></blockquote>\n\nWhen the first Labour government, led by Ramsay MacDonald, took office in 1924, Blatchford responded to Thompson's enthusiasm: \"I don't like their policy and I don't trust them. They are in no sense Socialists. At present they are Liberals and we shall have a blend of Liberal shibboleths and communist insanity\".<ref>Thompson, p. 230.</ref> When [[Sir Edward Hulton, 1st Baronet|Sir Edward Hulton]] sold most of his newspapers to [[Harold Harmsworth, 1st Viscount Rothermere|Lord Rothermere]], Blatchford wrote a letter to ''The Morning Post'':\n\n<blockquote>As a protest against the attempt of the syndicated newspapers to muzzle the press and dictate to the Government, I have resigned my position on ''The Sunday Chronicle'' and ''The Sunday Herald''...the public should be helped to realise that the political judgments of the syndicated newspapers are not sincere and considered opinions of trained, independent thinkers, but the broadcast railings of one rich man in a panic over the [[Capital Levy]]. It is important that this should be said, and that the country should understand that the voice of Lord Rothermere is not the voice of public opinion. His standardised newspapers are journalistic tied houses, where proprietorial dope is sold as honest beer.<ref name=\"Thompson, p. 232\">Thompson, p. 232.</ref></blockquote>\n\nBlatchford voted Conservative in 1924.<ref name=\"Thompson, p. 232\"/> However, his later books indicate a continued faith in his own English version of socialism. Moreover, the Clarion Movement carried on as a socialist popular movement, taking its cue from Blatchford, into the 1930s and beyond, as indicated by the continued existence of the Clarion rambling and cycling clubs and the founding of the newspaper ''The New Clarion'' in 1932. In a 1931 letter to Alexander Thompson, Blatchford proclaimed his last political credo, his language remaining fiery and eloquent:\n\n<blockquote>I have always been a [[Tory Democracy|Tory Democrat]]...You remember that from the first the Clarion crowd and the [[Keir Hardie|Hardie]] crowd were out of harmony ... I loathe the \u201ctop-hatted, frock-coated magnolia-scented\u201d snobocracy as much as you do; but I cannot away with the Keir Hardies and [[Arthur Henderson]]s and Ramsay MacDonalds and [[George Bernard Shaw|Bernard Shaw]]s and [[James Maxton|Maxton]]s. Not long ago you told me in a letter of some trade union delegates who were smoking cigars and drinking whisky at the House of Commons at the expense of their unions. You liked them not. Nor do I like the Trade Union bigots who have cheated [[J. H. Thomas]] of his pension...I am glad the Labour Party is defeated because I believe they would have disrupted the British Empire. I dreaded their childish cosmopolitanism; their foolish faith that we could abolish crime by reducing the police force. All the other nations are out for their own ends. American enthusiasm for Naval Disarmament is not dictated by a love of peace. It is an expression of naval rivalry. All the nations hated our naval supremacy. Do the Americans love us? Do the French love us? Is France, America, Italy, devoted to an unselfish and human peace? Can we dispel the bellicose sentiments of Russia and China and Japan by sending an old pantaloon to talk platitudes at Geneva, or by disbanding the Horse Guards and scrapping a few submarines?...The England of my affection and devotion is not a country nor a people: it is a tradition, the finest tradition the world has ever produced. The Labour Party do not subscribe to that tradition; do not know it; could not feel it. And if that tradition is to survive, the policy of scuttle and surrender must be abandoned. You agree with all this I feel sure. You always upheld the [[Pax Britannica]]. We have not drifted apart, old pal: our separation is only geographical.<ref>Thompson, pp. 230\u2013231.</ref></blockquote>\n\nAfter [[Adolf Hitler]] became German Chancellor in 1933, Blatchford \"began to smell brimstone\", in the words of his biographer Laurence Thompson. Blatchford said: \"The people ought to know; but who will let me say what ought to be said?\" Blatchford feared that people would say: \"Oh, ''Blatchford''. He has Germany on the brain.\"<ref>Thompson, p. 233.</ref> When [[Winston Churchill]] began warning of the dangers of Nazi Germany, Blatchford remarked: \"Ha! He's learning! Now watch ''him'' get it in the neck\". Later on, Blatchford believed Churchill's conduct redeemed what he considered his past political errors.<ref name=\"Thompson, p. 216\"/>\n\nOn 17 December 1943, Blatchford died in [[Horsham, Sussex]] at the age of 92.\n\n==Legacy==\nBlatchford's 'love of country' themes were not a late aberration but can be found throughout his output. His combination of libertarianism, socialism and conservatism mark him out as one of the more original activists in English political history. The first Labour Chancellor of the Exchequer, Philip Snowden, said of Blatchford in his autobiography:\n\n<blockquote>In these years Mr. Blatchford gave invaluable help to Socialist propaganda. No man did more than he to make Socialism understood by the ordinary working man. His writings in them had nothing of economic abstruseness. He based his appeal on the principles of human justice. He preached Socialism as a system of industrial co-operation for the common good. His arguments and illustrations were drawn from facts and experiences within the knowledge of the common people. Socialism as he taught it was not a cold, materialistic theory, but the promise of a new life as full, sweet and noble as the world can give...Mr. Blatchford is still living, hale and hearty, his mental powers undiminished at the ripe age of eighty-three. I saw him recently, and we talked of those grand and inspiring times of forty years ago. Only the men who were in the Socialist movement in those days can know the great part Robert Blatchford took in making it popular, and of the personal devotion he inspired by his writings.<ref>Philip, Viscount Snowden, ''An Autobiography. Volume One. 1864\u20131919'' (London: Ivor Nicholson and Watson, 1934), pp. 58\u201359.</ref></blockquote>\n\nThe General Secretary of the Trade Union Congress from 1925 to 1946, Sir [[Walter Citrine]], was influenced by Blatchford's writings. He said of ''Britain for the British'': \"I found it a cogent and reasoned argument for Socialism. It was written with a clearness and bite which were unusual\".<ref>Lord Citrine, ''Men and Work. An Autobiography'' (London: Hutchinson, 1964), p. 62.</ref> [[Clement Attlee]] also spoke of Blatchford's influence on his beliefs.<ref name=osborne>{{cite journal |last=Osborne |first=John W.|year=1997 |title=Robert Blatchford: Neglected Socialist |journal= The Journal of the Rutgers University Libraries|publisher=[[Rutgers University Libraries]] |volume=58 |pages=62\u201367 |doi=10.14713/jrul.v58i0.26 |doi-access=free }}</ref> [[A.

He was also noted as a prominent [[atheist]], [[Nationalism|nationalist]] and opponent of [[eugenics]]. In the early 1920s, after the death of his wife, he turned towards [[spiritualism]].\n\n==Early life==\nRobert Blatchford was born 17 March 1851 in [[Maidstone]], [[Kent]]. His parents \u2013 John Glanville Blatchford, a strolling comedian, and Georgina Louisa Corri ''(maiden;'' 1821\u20131890), an actress \u2013 named him after the conservative [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom|Prime Minister]] [[Robert Peel]] who died the year before. His great-grandfather, by way of his mother, [[Domenico Corri]] (1746\u20131825), was an Italian musician and publisher who, in the late [[18th century]], moved from [[Rome]] to [[Edinburgh]] to teach music.<ref name=\"ODNB\" /> One of his grandnieces, [[Christine Glanville]] (1924\u20131999), was an acclaimed English puppeteer.\n\nBlatchford's father died in 1853, leaving him in the care of his mother. She continued her acting career for nine years, and Blatchford spent much of his early life close to the stage. To help support the family, Blatchford and his brother Montagu would perform with their mother, doing comedic renditions and dances for extra income. In 1862 the family moved to [[Halifax, West Yorkshire|Halifax]], where it was hoped that Blatchford and his brother could learn a trade. Blatchford was first employed as an odd job boy in a lithographic printing works, for which he earned a salary of eighteen pence a week. As a child he attended school only occasionally, firstly in Halifax and later in Portsmouth. Despite the brevity of his educational experience, it provided him with enough insight that he called the education system a 'cram' method.\n\nThough lacking a formal education, Blatchford taught himself from the age of eight, reading the [[Bible]], ''[[Pilgrim's Progress]]'', and the works of [[Charles Dickens]]. Throughout his childhood he was frail and sickly, and doctors suggested that he would not reach adulthood. This illness gave Blatchford time to read, something he would not have been able to pursue as thoroughly if employed. Around 1864, Georgina secured full-time employment as a dressmaker and immediately apprenticed both her sons, sending Montagu to a lithographic printer and Robert to a brushmaker. At the brushmaker factory, Blatchford met Sarah Crossley, who he would marry in 1880.\n\nBy 1871 Blatchford left Halifax, though his reason for doing so has been the cause of debate. Laurence Thomson argues that the departure was due to a quarrel with his mother, but Blatchford's daughter Dorothea maintains that his decision to leave was caused by the difficulty of his life in Halifax. On [[May Day]] 1871, Blatchford walked to Hull, then continued on to London via Yarmouth.\n\n==Military and early journalistic career==\nAfter leaving Halifax, Blatchford joined the [[British Army|Army]] and rose to become a [[sergeant major]] by 1874. By the time of his promotion, he had also achieved the Army's second class certificate of education. Blatchford served with the Irish regiment 103rd [[Royal Dublin Fusiliers|Dublin Fusiliers]] and the [[96th Regiment of Foot]]. The pleasures of army life stimulated some of Blatchford's best writing, but in 1877 he left the army to become a clerk in the [[River Weaver|Weaver Navigation Company]]. While employed as a clerk, he carefully used his spare time to learn grammar, syntax, and shorthand. In 1880 he married Sarah Crossley, whom he met in Halifax, at the Zion Chapel in Halifax; they then settled in [[Norwich]]. Sarah was the daughter of a [[domestic worker|domestic servant]] and a mechanic. Around this time Blatchford became frustrated with his job, and decided that he wished to become an artist. Because employment opportunities for artists in Norwich were scarce, however, he instead decided to become a writer. Blatchford's writing career began in 1882 at the ''Yorkshireman'' newspaper, where he had a sketch published. He obtained his first full-time writing job through his friend Alexander Muttock Thompson, who worked for the Manchester ''[[Sporting Chronicle]]''. Thompson recommended Blatchford to a friend who ran the newspaper ''[[Bell's Life in London]]''. A year later, Blatchford moved his family to South London to write for ''Bell's Life'' and the ''Leeds Toby''.\n\nIn 1885, Blatchford began to write for the Manchester ''[[Sunday Chronicle]]''. When ''Bell's Life'' failed two years later, he moved to a full-time position at the ''Sunday Chronicle''. Before beginning at the ''Sunday Chronicle'', Blatchford took a short holiday on the Isle of Wight after the death of his two children. At this time he had not begun to espouse socialist views, but the societal reactions to the competitiveness of industrial society in Northern England began affecting his sentiments. The largest political influence on Blatchford was the South [[Salford, Greater Manchester|Salford]] [[Social Democratic Federation]]. This change is seen in a series of 1889 articles he wrote for the ''Sunday Chronicle'' which denounced the housing conditions in Manchester and organised two working men's Sanitary Organisations in the area.\n\nReflecting back on this period, Blatchford stated in the ''Fortnightly Review'' in 1907 that \"Dr. Cozier is mistaken if he thinks I took my Socialism from [[Karl Marx|Marx]], or that it depends upon the Marxian theory of value. I have never read a page of Marx. I got the idea of collective ownership from [[Henry Hyndman|H. M. Hyndman]]; the rest of my Socialism I thought out myself. English Socialism is not German: it is English. English Socialism is not Marxian; it is humanitarian. It does not depend upon any theory of 'economic justice' but upon humanity and common sense.\"\n\n==''The Clarion''==\nIn 1890, while based in [[Manchester]], Blatchford became actively involved in the Labour Movement. He founded the Manchester branch of the [[Fabian Society]], and launched a weekly socialist newspaper, ''[[The Clarion]]'', in 1891. Later that year, he used his column to announce that he had accepted the invitation of the [[Bradford Labour Union]] to become the Independent Labour candidate in [[Bradford East (UK Parliament constituency)|Bradford East]]. However, his socialist stance forced him to leave the ''[[Sunday Chronicle]],'' which in turn left him with a severe reduction in income.\n\nHaving left the newspaper on 12 December 1891, Blatchford set up ''The Clarion'', but a printing error made its first edition was almost completely illegible.{{citation needed|date=July 2011}} Nevertheless, it still sold at least 40,000 copies. It continued to sell this number and more during the following years. By 1910 it was selling about 80,000 copies of each issue. [[Bernard Semmel]] described it as \"the most successful socialist publication in Great Britain during the period before the war of 1914\".<ref>Semmel, p. 214.</ref>\n\nBy 1892 Blatchford had removed himself from the candidature in Bradford East and began siding with the [[Social Democratic Federation]] (SDF) against the Fabians' policy of \"permeation.\" The joining of ''The Clarion'' and SDF resulted in the formation in 1892 of the Manchester Independent Labour Party, which soon devised the Manchester Fourth Clause. By 1893 Blatchford was the leader of his own clique within the newly founded national [[Independent Labour Party]], the Clarionettes, whose extraordinary dynamism was expressed in its numerous choral societies, [[National Clarion Cycling Club|''Clarion'' cycling clubs]], Socialist Scouts, and glee clubs.\n\nCentral to the ''Clarion'' movement were the ''Clarion'' cycling clubs, whose members, frequently accompanied by the \"''Clarion'' Van\", travelled the country distributing socialist literature and holding mass meetings. [[Robert Tressell]]'s socialist novel ''[[The Ragged Trousered Philanthropists]]'' contains a detailed account based on a meeting organised by the [[National Clarion Cycling Club#Clarion Scouts|''Clarion'' scouts]].\n\nThe ''Clarion'' movement also supported many industrial disputes at this time, including the three-year lockout of the slateworkers of the [[Penrhyn Quarry|Penrhyn]] [[Slate industry|slate quarry]] in North [[Wales]]. ''The Clarion'' collected \u00a31,500 to support the people of [[Bethesda, Wales|Bethesda]].\n\nThere was a revolt in the county federation created by the ILP in 1894, as Blatchford urged the formation of a united socialist party. In the same year he resigned from the editorship of ''The Clarion'' due to ill health and developed depression. He started to edit it again in 1896. He supported the [[Second Boer War|Boer War]], which lost him support from some sections of the labour movement. Blatchford denounced his \"cosmopolitan friends, who are so cosmopolitan that they can admire every country but their own, and love all men except Englishmen\".<ref name=\"Semmel, p. 217\">Semmel, p. 217.</ref> He criticised the \"smug, self-righteous prigs\" in the labour movement who, while \"despising military glory, are yet so eloquent over the marksmanship and courage of the Boers\".<ref name=\"Semmel, p. 217\"/> He wrote that his \"whole heart is with the British troops ... When England is at war, I'm English. I have no politics and no party. I am English.\"<ref name=\"Semmel, p. 218\">Semmel, p. 218.</ref>  Responding to claims from the right-wing press that he wanted to \u2018turn people against their country\u2019, he retorted that he wanted \u2018to make people so fond of their country that they shall desire to possess it\u2019.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Swift|first=David|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.5949/liverpool/9781786940025.001.0001|title=For Class and Country|date=2017-11-01|publisher=Liverpool University Press|isbn=978-1-78694-002-5}}</ref>\n\nAfter the war Blatchford continued to agitate for a united socialist party and supported the London Progressive Party. He was critical of the [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]], which was founded in 1900, for what he perceived as its complete subservience to Liberalism, especially in its [[Cobdenism|Cobdenite]] internationalist views on foreign policy.<ref>Semmel, p. 215.</ref> Blatchford said of himself and his colleagues at ''The Clarion'': \"We were out for Socialism and nothing but Socialism, and we were Britons first and Socialists next.\"<ref>Blatchford, p. 199.</ref>\n\nBlatchford criticised free trade from an economic nationalist perspective. Free trade had made it impossible for Britain to feed herself and had destroyed British agriculture. This was especially serious in wartime because Britain could be starved into submission due to the dependence for her food on foreign nations.<ref name=\"Semmel, p. 218\"/> When [[Joseph Chamberlain]] launched his crusade for [[Tariff Reform League|Tariff Reform]] in 1903, Blatchford's response was ambiguous. He did not formally endorse Chamberlain's campaign, but ''The Clarion'' praised his aims\u2014the revival of British agriculture, a self-sufficient Empire, and producer-focused instead of consumer-focused economic system.<ref>Semmel, p. 219.</ref> Blatchford said he did not believe in tariff reform as applied by [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservatives]], but that a socialist government would find it a necessary instrument.<ref>Semmel, p. 220.</ref>\n \nA further development in Blatchford's thinking cost him further readers, when he began denouncing organised religion in such works as ''God and My Neighbour'' in 1903 and \u2018Not Guilty: A Defence of the Bottom Dog\u2019 1905. Again, to antagonise the ILP, the ''Clarion'' raised funds for Victor Grayson, whom the ILP had declined to support. He justified his attacks as being because Labour was too close to the Liberals.\n\n==''Merrie England''==\n{{main|Merrie England (Robert Blatchford book)|l1=Merrie England}}\nA series of articles on socialism in ''The Clarion'' were published in book form in 1893 as ''Merrie England''. The first edition sold 30,000 copies. The year after, a pocket-sized edition was published, which sold 25,000 copies.<ref>Thompson, p. 98.</ref> A penny edition was published in 1894, with 250,000 copies being ordered before publication and within a year 750,000 copies had been despatched across the English speaking world.<ref>Thompson, p. 99.</ref> In Britain and America, the book sold over two million copies. In the opinion of [[Robert Ensor]], the book \"helped to make socialism really well known in England for the first time...It was Blatchford's highest flight as a propagandist; he never surpassed it, and through it mainly he left his mark upon history\".<ref name=\"ODNB\">R.

P. Scott]] of the ''Manchester Guardian'' wrote to Blatchford, saying: \"I have been reading ''Merrie England'' and (''pace'' the reviewers) find a great deal in it!\"<ref name=\"Thompson, p. 100\"/> The ''Manchester Guardian'' said that for every British convert to socialism made by ''[[Das Kapital]]'' there were a hundred made by ''Merrie England''.<ref name=\"Thompson, p. 101\"/>\n\nAt the [[Oxford Union]] a motion was approved by 103 to 54 that stated that \"the aims of the Socialist tract, ''Merrie England'', are but the baseless fabric of a vision\". The motion was seconded by [[Hilaire Belloc]].<ref>Thompson, pp. 100-101.</ref>\n\nBlatchford was a [[Vegetarianism|vegetarian]] and in ''Merrie England'' he mentioned the economic, health and humanitarian benefits of a vegetarian diet.<ref>Li, Chien-hui.

ISBN 978-1-137-52650-2</ref>\n\n==War scare of 1909==\nAt the end of the second week of December 1909, Blatchford wrote ten daily articles for the ''[[Daily Mail]]'' warning of the German menace:\n\n<blockquote>I write these articles because I believe that Germany is deliberately preparing to destroy the British Empire; and because I know that we are not ready or able to defend ourselves against a sudden and formidable attack...At the present moment the whole country is in a ferment about the Budget and the Peers and the Election. It seems sheer criminal lunacy to waste time and strength in chasing such political bubble when the existence of the Empire is threatened.<ref name=\"Morris, p. 213\">Morris, p. 213.</ref></blockquote>\n\nThe articles received considerable attention in Britain and Germany, and when published as a pamphlet sold over one and a half million copies.<ref name=\"Morris, p. 213\"/> The [[Edward VII|King]] \"lamented Blatchford's violence\"<ref>Morris, p. 213</ref> and the [[Wilhelm II, German Emperor|Kaiser]] read Blatchford's articles with care and denounced them as \"very mischievous and singularly ill-timed\".<ref>Morris, p. 423, p. 219.</ref> Sir [[Charles Ottley]], the Secretary to the Committee of Imperial Defence, wrote to [[Reginald Brett, 2nd Viscount Esher|Lord Esher]] that Blatchford's appeal was not based on a partisan, political basis as he had said that the country did not want a Liberal or Unionist government but a MAN: \"His strength is that he knows what he wants and is not afraid to ask for it in plain language...The burthen of the song is\u2014compulsory service, a strong navy and a general raising of the standard of education and living of the masses of the British people\".<ref name=\"Morris, p. 214\">Morris, p. 214.</ref> [[Evelyn Baring, 1st Earl of Cromer|Lord Cromer]] publicly declared that he shared Blatchford's patriotism.<ref>Morris, p. 216.</ref> The articles ensured that defence was a major issue in the ensuing [[January 1910 United Kingdom general election|general election of January 1910]].<ref>Morris, p. 215.</ref> After the election the Liberal MP [[Reginald McKenna]] boasted that Blatchford had not cost the Liberals a single vote.<ref>Blatchford, p. 224.</ref><ref name=\"Thompson, p. 216\">Thompson, p. 216.</ref> Keir Hardie said that \"the whole Socialist movement was rocking with suppressed laughter\".<ref>Blatchford, p. 225.</ref>\n\nThe ''Daily Mail''\u2032s Berlin correspondent told [[Alfred Harmsworth, 1st Viscount Northcliffe|Lord Northcliffe]]: \"In a long experience...I do not recall a foreign journalistic event which so focussed the attention of the German press and public\".<ref name=\"Morris, p. 214\"/> There was universal condemnation in German newspapers, including Social Democratic, Catholic and Pan-German organs. When the German Chancellor [[Theobald von Bethmann-Hollweg]] complained to [[Edward Goschen]], the British ambassador in Berlin, the Foreign Secretary Sir [[Edward Grey, 1st Viscount Grey of Fallodon|Edward Grey]] advised Goschen to explain the articles as \"not really anti-German but alarmist...to create a scare\".<ref name=\"Morris, p. 214\"/>\n\nShortly before the [[December 1910 United Kingdom general election|general election of December 1910]], the ''Daily Mail'' published Blatchford's series of articles on \u2018The Greatest Issue of All\u2019, the German threat. However these were nowhere near as influential as his previous ones and defence was not an issue in the election.<ref>Morris, p. 221.</ref>\n\nIn 1909 he began advocating conscription but in 1912 troops were used for strike breaking and Blatchford turned against it: \"Universal military service under the (present) ruling classes would result in slavery. I regard invasion as the lesser evil\". However he supported conscription again in 1915, and proclaimed it should be implemented along with the \"conscription of wealth\".<ref>Thompson, p. 215 + n.</ref> Before the Great War, Blatchford toured Germany and after he returned to England he wrote:\n\n<blockquote>I am convinced that...they will be plunged into war without their will. I like Germany; I like German cities; and I like the German people. But I believe that the rulers of the German people are deliberately and cynically preparing to hurl them into a wicked and a desperate war of conquest...The Germans cannot prevent that war, because they do not believe it is coming. The British could prevent that war if, before it is too late, they could be really convinced that it is coming. That is why I want to convince them that war is coming, because I want to prevent that horrible war.<ref>Thompson, p. 213.</ref></blockquote>\n\nBlatchford was impressed by the cleanliness and efficiency in Germany: \"You don't see anything like that in Germany. I thought to myself, is this how we are preparing to fight for the existence of our Empire? What use will these ragged, famished spectres be when we have our backs to the wall?\"<ref>Thompson, p. 214.</ref>\n\n==Later life==\nOn 4 August 1914, Blatchford wrote to his friend [[Alexander M. Thompson|Alexander Thompson]]: \"I shall write today a cautious article counselling peace and suggesting that Sir [[Edward Grey, 1st Viscount Grey of Fallodon|E. Grey]] should ask Russia and Germany to suspend hostilities pending a friendly mediation by America, England and Italy, or any one of those powers. But I do not think really that European peace is possible until Germany has been defeated and humiliated. And I realise the great possibility that we shall be at war with Germany before the ''Clarion'' comes out. And I hope we are\".<ref>Thompson, pp. 222\u2013223.</ref> The Clarion Movement was split when Blatchford swung his paper in support of the British participation in the [[First World War]]. The circulation for ''The Clarion'' fell by 10,000 in a week but when in September 1914 Blatchford wrote a page of ''The Weekly Dispatch'' every Sunday its circulation rose by 50,000.<ref name=\"Thompson, p. 223\">Thompson, p. 223.</ref> In his first article for that paper, Blatchford correctly predicted that the German Army would not reach Paris and of General Joffre's flank along the Marne.<ref name=\"Thompson, p. 223\"/>\n\nBlatchford visited France in October 1914 and was shocked by the conduct of the Germans in waging war. Initially warning his readers of fake atrocity stories, Blatchford was shocked by the ruined villages in France and the stories he heard, \"too horrible and too unclean to be revealed in print\". He wrote to Thompson in 1933: \"In the early days of the war the movement howled with indignation about the lying charges brought against the German General Staff and troops. The noble Germans were incapable of such crimes. British and Belgian and American witnesses were all liars. Today the same intelligent comrades are denouncing the atrocities committed by the Nazi 'storm troops' upon innocent and helpless Jews. Well, old pal, may I suggest that if the Germans of today are guilty perhaps the Huns of 1914 were not quite innocent\".<ref name=\"Thompson, p. 223\"/>\n\nIn his articles during the war, Blatchford campaigned for better pay for the soldiers and considerable pensions for disabled soldiers, soldiers' widows and children.<ref>Thompson, p. 224, p. 226.</ref> When a soldier wrote to him, claiming his opinions would not be accepted by the Army but those of [[Philip Snowden]] and [[Ramsay MacDonald]] would, Blatchford replied: \"I am sorry. I cannot help it. You want peace. But you cannot have peace without victory...The struggle with Germany will not end with the present war, and we may some day have to fight Germany single-handed\".<ref>Thompson, p. 226.</ref>\n\nIn 1915, Blatchford formed the [[National Democratic and Labour Party]] (NDP) as a splinter from the right wing of the [[British Socialist Party]] and for the [[1918 United Kingdom general election|1918 General Election]], the NDP stood in 18 constituencies and won 9 [[Member of parliament|members of Parliament]] with 156,834 votes. It thereby became the first party formed by a right-wing split from the Labour party in Britain to win seats in Parliament at a general election.\n\nBlatchford's wife died in 1921, and later he took an interest in Spiritualism. In 1923 he wrote in response to claims in the press that he had been converted away from socialism by reading [[Henry Ford]]'s autobiography:\n\n<blockquote>I have never been converted from Socialism. But careful observation of the facts of for the last twelve years or so has convinced me that Socialism will not work, and a study of Mr. Ford's methods has provided what seems to me as good a substitute as we may hope in this imperfect world. Socialism as I knew it in past years was an excellent, almost a perfect, theory...The [[golden rule]] will not work in international politics, because the nations are not good enough to live up to it. Real Socialism strongly resembles real Christianity. It is a counsel of perfection and cannot be adopted and adhered to by our imperfect humanity. There is nothing the matter with Socialism, but the people are neither wise enough nor good enough to make it a success. Socialism implies the self-abnegation of the individual for the good of the community.<ref>Thompson, pp. 229\u2013230.</ref></blockquote>\n\nWhen the first Labour government, led by Ramsay MacDonald, took office in 1924, Blatchford responded to Thompson's enthusiasm: \"I don't like their policy and I don't trust them. They are in no sense Socialists. At present they are Liberals and we shall have a blend of Liberal shibboleths and communist insanity\".<ref>Thompson, p. 230.</ref> When [[Sir Edward Hulton, 1st Baronet|Sir Edward Hulton]] sold most of his newspapers to [[Harold Harmsworth, 1st Viscount Rothermere|Lord Rothermere]], Blatchford wrote a letter to ''The Morning Post'':\n\n<blockquote>As a protest against the attempt of the syndicated newspapers to muzzle the press and dictate to the Government, I have resigned my position on ''The Sunday Chronicle'' and ''The Sunday Herald''...the public should be helped to realise that the political judgments of the syndicated newspapers are not sincere and considered opinions of trained, independent thinkers, but the broadcast railings of one rich man in a panic over the [[Capital Levy]]. It is important that this should be said, and that the country should understand that the voice of Lord Rothermere is not the voice of public opinion. His standardised newspapers are journalistic tied houses, where proprietorial dope is sold as honest beer.<ref name=\"Thompson, p. 232\">Thompson, p. 232.</ref></blockquote>\n\nBlatchford voted Conservative in 1924.<ref name=\"Thompson, p. 232\"/> However, his later books indicate a continued faith in his own English version of socialism. Moreover, the Clarion Movement carried on as a socialist popular movement, taking its cue from Blatchford, into the 1930s and beyond, as indicated by the continued existence of the Clarion rambling and cycling clubs and the founding of the newspaper ''The New Clarion'' in 1932. In a 1931 letter to Alexander Thompson, Blatchford proclaimed his last political credo, his language remaining fiery and eloquent:\n\n<blockquote>I have always been a [[Tory Democracy|Tory Democrat]]...You remember that from the first the Clarion crowd and the [[Keir Hardie|Hardie]] crowd were out of harmony ... I loathe the \u201ctop-hatted, frock-coated magnolia-scented\u201d snobocracy as much as you do; but I cannot away with the Keir Hardies and [[Arthur Henderson]]s and Ramsay MacDonalds and [[George Bernard Shaw|Bernard Shaw]]s and [[James Maxton|Maxton]]s. Not long ago you told me in a letter of some trade union delegates who were smoking cigars and drinking whisky at the House of Commons at the expense of their unions. You liked them not. Nor do I like the Trade Union bigots who have cheated [[J. H. Thomas]] of his pension...I am glad the Labour Party is defeated because I believe they would have disrupted the British Empire. I dreaded their childish cosmopolitanism; their foolish faith that we could abolish crime by reducing the police force. All the other nations are out for their own ends. American enthusiasm for Naval Disarmament is not dictated by a love of peace. It is an expression of naval rivalry. All the nations hated our naval supremacy. Do the Americans love us? Do the French love us? Is France, America, Italy, devoted to an unselfish and human peace? Can we dispel the bellicose sentiments of Russia and China and Japan by sending an old pantaloon to talk platitudes at Geneva, or by disbanding the Horse Guards and scrapping a few submarines?...The England of my affection and devotion is not a country nor a people: it is a tradition, the finest tradition the world has ever produced. The Labour Party do not subscribe to that tradition; do not know it; could not feel it. And if that tradition is to survive, the policy of scuttle and surrender must be abandoned. You agree with all this I feel sure. You always upheld the [[Pax Britannica]]. We have not drifted apart, old pal: our separation is only geographical.<ref>Thompson, pp. 230\u2013231.</ref></blockquote>\n\nAfter [[Adolf Hitler]] became German Chancellor in 1933, Blatchford \"began to smell brimstone\", in the words of his biographer Laurence Thompson. Blatchford said: \"The people ought to know; but who will let me say what ought to be said?\" Blatchford feared that people would say: \"Oh, ''Blatchford''. He has Germany on the brain.\"<ref>Thompson, p. 233.</ref> When [[Winston Churchill]] began warning of the dangers of Nazi Germany, Blatchford remarked: \"Ha! He's learning! Now watch ''him'' get it in the neck\". Later on, Blatchford believed Churchill's conduct redeemed what he considered his past political errors.<ref name=\"Thompson, p. 216\"/>\n\nOn 17 December 1943, Blatchford died in [[Horsham, Sussex]] at the age of 92.\n\n==Legacy==\nBlatchford's 'love of country' themes were not a late aberration but can be found throughout his output. His combination of libertarianism, socialism and conservatism mark him out as one of the more original activists in English political history. The first Labour Chancellor of the Exchequer, Philip Snowden, said of Blatchford in his autobiography:\n\n<blockquote>In these years Mr. Blatchford gave invaluable help to Socialist propaganda. No man did more than he to make Socialism understood by the ordinary working man. His writings in them had nothing of economic abstruseness. He based his appeal on the principles of human justice. He preached Socialism as a system of industrial co-operation for the common good. His arguments and illustrations were drawn from facts and experiences within the knowledge of the common people. Socialism as he taught it was not a cold, materialistic theory, but the promise of a new life as full, sweet and noble as the world can give...Mr. Blatchford is still living, hale and hearty, his mental powers undiminished at the ripe age of eighty-three. I saw him recently, and we talked of those grand and inspiring times of forty years ago. Only the men who were in the Socialist movement in those days can know the great part Robert Blatchford took in making it popular, and of the personal devotion he inspired by his writings.<ref>Philip, Viscount Snowden, ''An Autobiography. Volume One. 1864\u20131919'' (London: Ivor Nicholson and Watson, 1934), pp. 58\u201359.</ref></blockquote>\n\nThe General Secretary of the Trade Union Congress from 1925 to 1946, Sir [[Walter Citrine]], was influenced by Blatchford's writings. He said of ''Britain for the British'': \"I found it a cogent and reasoned argument for Socialism. It was written with a clearness and bite which were unusual\".<ref>Lord Citrine, ''Men and Work. An Autobiography'' (London: Hutchinson, 1964), p. 62.</ref> [[Clement Attlee]] also spoke of Blatchford's influence on his beliefs.<ref name=osborne>{{cite journal |last=Osborne |first=John W.|year=1997 |title=Robert Blatchford: Neglected Socialist |journal= The Journal of the Rutgers University Libraries|publisher=[[Rutgers University Libraries]] |volume=58 |pages=62\u201367 |doi=10.14713/jrul.v58i0.26 |doi-access=free }}</ref> [[A.
