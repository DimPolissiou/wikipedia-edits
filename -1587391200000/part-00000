Tailings are distinct from [[overburden]], which is the waste rock or other material that overlies an ore or mineral body and is displaced during mining without being processed.\n\nThe extraction of minerals from ore can be done two ways: [[placer mining]], which uses water and gravity to concentrate the valuable minerals, or [[hard rock mining]], which pulverizes the rock containing the ore and then relies on chemical reactions to concentrate the sought-after material.

On average, worldwide, there is one big accident involving a tailings dam each year.<ref name=\"collapse\">{{cite book|title=Collapse|url=https://archive.org/details/collapse00jare|url-access=registration|author=Jared Diamond|year=2005|publisher=Penguin}}, page 452-458</ref> Tailings ponds can also be a source of [[acid drainage]], leading to the need for permanent monitoring and treatment of water passing through the tailings dam; the cost of mine cleanup has typically been 10 times that of mining industry estimates when acid drainage was involved.<ref name=\"collapse\"/> Other disasters caused by tailings dam failures are, [[2000 Baia Mare cyanide spill|the 2000 Baia Mare cyanide spill]] and [[Ajka alumina plant accident|the Ajka alumina plant accident]]. (See also [[List of tailings dam failures]].)\n\n== Storage methods ==\nHistorically, tailings were disposed of in the most convenient manner, such as in downstream running water or down [[Drainage|drains]]. Because of concerns about these sediments in the water and other issues, tailings ponds came into use.  The sustainability challenge in the management of tailings and waste rock is to dispose of material, such that it is inert or, if not, stable and contained, to minimise water and energy inputs and the surface footprint of wastes and to move toward finding alternate uses.<ref name=\"Franks\" />\n\n===Tailings dams and ponds===\n{{main|Tailings dam}}\nBounded by impoundments (an impoundment is a dam), these dams typically use \"local materials\" including the tailings themselves, and may be considered [[embankment dam]]s.<ref name=EPADesignDams/> Traditionally, the only option for tailings storage was to deal with a tailings slurry.{{Clarify|date=November 2009}} This slurry is a dilute stream of the tailings solids within water that was sent to the tailings storage area. The modern tailings designer has a range of tailings products to choose from depending upon how much water is removed from the slurry prior to discharge.   The removal of water not only can create a better storage system in some cases (e.g. dry stacking, see below) but can also assist in water recovery which is a major issue as many mines are in arid regions. In a 1994 description of tailings impoundments, however, the U.S. EPA stated that dewatering methods may be prohibitively expensive except in special circumstances.<ref name=EPADesignDams/> Subaqueous storage of tailings has also been used.<ref name=EPADesignDams/>\n\nTailing ponds are areas of refused [[mining]] tailings where the waterborne refuse material is pumped into a [[pond]] to allow the [[sedimentation]] (meaning separation) of solids from the water. The pond is generally impounded with a dam, and known as tailings impoundments or tailings dams.<ref name=EPADesignDams>US EPA. (1994). [http://epa.gov/waste/nonhaz/industrial/special/mining/techdocs/tailings.pdf Technical Report: Design and Evaluation of Tailings Dams] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130510155552/http://epa.gov/waste/nonhaz/industrial/special/mining/techdocs/tailings.pdf |date=10 May 2013 }}.</ref> It was estimated in 2000 that there were about 3,500 active tailings impoundments in the world.<ref name=StewardDams/> The ponded water is of some benefit as it minimizes fine tailings from being transported by wind into populated areas where the toxic chemicals could be potentially hazardous to human health; however, it is also harmful to the environment. Tailing ponds are often somewhat dangerous because they attract wildlife such as waterfowl or caribou as they appear to be a natural pond, but they can be highly toxic and harmful to the health of these animals. Tailings ponds are used to store the waste made from separating minerals from rocks, or the slurry produced from tar sands mining. Tailings are sometimes mixed with other materials such as [[bentonite]] to form a thicker slurry that slows the release of impacted water to the environment.\n\nThere are many different subsets of this method, including valley impoundments, ring dikes, in-pit impoundments, and specially dug pits.<ref name=EPADesignDams/> The most common is the valley pond, which takes advantage of the natural topographical depression in the ground.<ref name=EPADesignDams/> Large earthen dams may be constructed and then filled with the tailings. Exhausted open pit mines may be refilled with tailings. In all instances, due consideration must be made to contamination of the underlying water table, amongst other issues. Dewatering is an important part of pond storage, as the tailings are added to the storage facility the water is removed - usually by draining into decant tower structures. The water removed can thus be reused in the processing cycle. Once a storage facility is filled and completed, the surface can be covered with topsoil and revegetation commenced. However, unless a non-permeable capping method is used, water that infiltrates into the storage facility will have to be continually pumped out into the future.\n\n===Paste tailings===\nPaste tailings is a modification to the conventional methods of disposal of tailings (pond storage). Conventional tailings slurries are composed of a low percent of solids and relatively high water content (normally ranging from 20% to 60% solids for most hard rock mining) and when deposited into the tailings pond the solids and liquids separate. In paste tailings the percent of solids in the tailings slurry is increased through the use of paste thickeners to produce a product where the minimal separation of water and solids occurs and the material is deposited into a storage area as a paste (with a consistency somewhat like toothpaste). Paste tailings has the advantage that more water is recycled in the processing plant and therefore the process is more water efficient than conventional tailings and there is a lower potential for seepage. However the cost of the thickening is generally higher than for conventional tailings and the pumping costs for the paste  are also normally higher than for conventional tailings as positive displacement pumps are normally required to transport the tailings from the processing plant to the storage area. Paste tailings are used in several locations around the world including Sunrise Dam in Western Australia and Bulyanhulu Gold Mine in Tanzania.<ref>{{citation|first1 = J. A. | last1 = Theriault | last2= Frostiak |first2=J. |last3=Welch |first3=D. | title = Surface Disposal of Paste Tailings at the Bulyanhulu Gold Mine, Tanzania}}</ref>\n\n===Dry stacking===\nTailings do not have to be stored in ponds or sent as slurries into oceans, rivers or streams. There is a growing use of the practice of dewatering tailings using vacuum or pressure filters so the tailings can then be stacked.<ref>{{cite conference | first = M. P. | last = Davies |last2=Rice |first2=S.  | title = An alternative to conventional tailing management - \"dry stack\" filtered tailings | conference = Proceedings of the Eighth International Conference on Tailings and Mine Waste | pages = 411\u2013422 | publisher = Balkema | date = 16\u201319 January 2001 | location = Fort Collins, Colorado, US}}</ref> This saves water which potentially reduces the impacts on the environment in terms of a reduction in the potential seepage rates, space used, leaves the tailings in a dense and stable arrangement and eliminates the long-term liability that ponds leave after mining is finished. However although there are potential merits to  dry stacked tailings these systems are often cost prohibitive due to increased capital cost to purchase and install the filter systems and the increase in operating costs (generally associated electricity consumption and consumables such as filter cloth) of such systems.\n\n===Storage in underground workings===\nWhile disposal into exhausted open pits is generally a straightforward operation, disposal into underground voids is more complex. A common modern approach is to mix a certain quantity of tailings with waste aggregate and cement, creating a product that can be used to backfill underground voids and [[Stoping (mining method)|stopes]]. A common term for this is HDPF - High Density Paste Fill. HDPF is a more expensive method of tailings disposal than pond storage, however it has many other benefits \u2013 not just environmental but it can significantly increase the stability of underground excavations by providing a means for ground stress to be transmitted across voids - rather than having to pass around them \u2013 which can cause mining induced seismic events like that suffered previously at the [[Beaconsfield Mine Disaster]].\n\n===Riverine tailings===\nUsually called RTD \u2013 Riverine Tailings Disposal. In most environments, not a particularly environmentally sound practice, it has seen significant utilisation in the past, leading to such spectacular environmental damage as done by the [[Mount Lyell Mining and Railway Company]] in [[Tasmania]] to the [[King River (Tasmania)|King River]], or the poisoning from the [[Panguna]] mine on [[Bougainville Island]], which led to large-scale civil unrest on the island, and the eventual permanent closing of the mine.<ref name=\"collapse\" />\n\nAs of 2005, only three mines operated by international companies continued to use river disposal: The [[Ok Tedi mine]], the [[Grasberg mine]]<ref name=\"collapse\" /> and the [[Porgera Gold Mine|Porgera mine]], all on New Guinea. This method is used in these cases due to seismic activity and landslide dangers which make other disposal methods impractical and dangerous.\n\n===Submarine tailings===\nCommonly referred to as STD (Submarine Tailings Disposal) or DSTD (Deep Sea Tailings Disposal). Tailings can be conveyed using a pipeline then discharged so as to eventually descend into the depths. Practically, it is not an ideal method, as the close proximity to off-shelf depths is rare. When STD is used, the depth of discharge is often what would be considered{{by whom|date=August 2015}} shallow, and extensive damage to the seafloor can result due to covering by the tailings product.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Association|first1=California Mining|title=Mine waste management|date=1991|publisher=Lewis Publishers|location=Chelsea, Mich.|isbn=9780873717465}}</ref> It is also critical{{according to|date=August 2015}} to control the density and temperature of the tailings product, to prevent it from travelling long distances, or even floating to the surface.\n\nThis method is used by the gold mine on [[Lihir Island]]; its waste disposal has been viewed by environmentalists as highly damaging, while the owners claim that it is not harmful.<ref name=\"collapse\" />\n\n=== Phytostabilisation ===\nPhytostabilisation is a form of [[phytoremediation]] that uses [[hyperaccumulator|hyperaccumulator plants]] for long-term stabilisation and containment of tailings, by sequestering pollutants in soil near the roots. The plant's presence can reduce wind erosion, or the plant's roots can prevent water erosion, immobilise metals by adsorption or accumulation, and provide a zone around the roots where the metals can precipitate and stabilise. Pollutants become less bioavailable and livestock, wildlife, and human exposure is reduced. This approach can be especially useful in dry environments, which are subject to wind and water dispersion.<ref>{{cite journal |journal= Environ Health Perspect |year=2008 |volume=116 |issue=3 |pages=278\u201383 |title= Phytostabilization of Mine Tailings in Arid and Semiarid Environments\u2014An Emerging Remediation Technology |author=Mendez MO, Maier RM |doi=10.1289/ehp.10608 |pmid= 18335091 |pmc= 2265025}}</ref>\n\n===Different methods===\nConsiderable effort and research continues to be made into discovering and refining better methods of tailings disposal. Research at the Porgera Gold Mine is focusing on developing a method of combining tailings products with coarse waste rock and waste muds to create a product that can be stored on the surface in generic-looking waste dumps or stockpiles. This would allow the current use of rivering disposal to cease. Considerable work remains to be done.   However, co-disposal has been successfully implemented by several designers including [[AMEC]] at, for example, the Elkview Mine in British Columbia.\n\n== Reprocessing ==\nAs mining techniques and the price of minerals improve, it is not unusual for tailings to be reprocessed using new methods, or more thoroughly with old methods, to recover additional minerals. Extensive tailings dumps of [[Kalgoorlie]] / Boulder in Western Australia were re-processed profitably in the 1990s by KalTails Mining.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.tailings.info/kaltails.htm|title=Kaltails project, Kalgoorlie, Western Australia|author=J.Engels & D.Dixon-Hardy|accessdate=19 October 2009|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100124082713/http://www.tailings.info/kaltails.htm|archive-date=24 January 2010|url-status=dead|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\nA machine called the PET4K Processing Plant has been used in a variety of countries for the past 20 years to remediate contaminated tailings.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://missoulian.com/news/state-and-regional/can-african-machine-produce-a-promising-future-in-butte/article_a2d81c9d-38ec-5262-ad36-2b8ac9ed27fa.html#tncms-source=infinity-scroll-summary-siderail-latest|title=Can African machine produce a promising future in Butte?|last=Smith|first=Mike|date=2017-09-25|work=[[Missoulian]]|access-date=2017-09-25|language=en}}</ref>\n\n==Pond reclamation by microbiology==\nDuring extraction of the oil from oil sand, tailings consisting of water, silt, clays and other solvents are also created. This solid will become mature fine tailings by gravity. Foght ''et al'' (1985) estimated that there are 10<sup>3</sup> anaerobic [[heterotrophs]] and 10<sup>4</sup> sulfate-reducing [[prokaryotes]] per milliliter in the tailings pond, based on conventional most probable number methods. Foght set up an experiment with two tailings ponds and an analysis of the [[archaea]], [[bacteria]], and the gas released from tailings ponds showed that those were [[methanogens]]. As the depth increased, the moles of CH<sub>4</sub> released actually decreased.<ref>Foght, J.M., Fedorak, P.M., Westlake, D.W.S., and Boerger, H.J. 1985. '' Microbial content and metabolic activities in the Syncrude tailings pond.'' AOSTRA J. Res. 1: 139\u2013146.</ref>\n\nSiddique (2006, 2007) states that methanogens in the tailings pond live and reproduce by anaerobic degradation, which will lower the molecular weight from [[naphtha]] to [[Aliphatic compound|aliphatic]], aromatic hydrocarbons, carbon dioxide and methane. Those archaea and bacteria can degrade the naphtha, which was considered as waste during the procedure of refining oil. Both of those degraded products are useful. Aliphatic, aromatic hydrocarbons and methane can be used as fuel in the humans\u2019 daily lives. In other words, these methanogens improve the coefficient of utilization. Moreover, these methanogens change the structure of the tailings pond and help the pore water efflux to be reused for processing oil sands. Because the archaea and bacteria metabolize and release bubbles within the tailings, the pore water can go through the soil easily. Since they accelerate the densification of mature fine tailings, the tailings ponds are enabled to settle the solids more quickly so that the tailings can be reclaimed earlier. Moreover, the water released from the tailings can be used in the procedure of refining oil. Reducing the demand of water can also protect the environment from drought.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Holowenko | first1 = F.M. | last2 = MacKinnon | first2 = M.D. | last3 = Fedorak | first3 = P.M. | year = 2000 | title = Methanogens and sulfate-reducing bacteria in oil sands fine tailings waste. | url = | journal = Can.

On average, worldwide, there is one big accident involving a tailings dam each year.<ref name=\"collapse\">{{cite book|title=Collapse|url=https://archive.org/details/collapse00jare|url-access=registration|author=Jared Diamond|year=2005|publisher=Penguin}}, page 452-458</ref> Tailings ponds can also be a source of [[acid drainage]], leading to the need for permanent monitoring and treatment of water passing through the tailings dam; the cost of mine cleanup has typically been 10 times that of mining industry estimates when acid drainage was involved.<ref name=\"collapse\"/> Other disasters caused by tailings dam failures are, [[2000 Baia Mare cyanide spill|the 2000 Baia Mare cyanide spill]] and [[Ajka alumina plant accident|the Ajka alumina plant accident]]. (See also [[List of tailings dam failures]].)\n\n== Storage methods ==\nHistorically, tailings were disposed of in the most convenient manner, such as in downstream running water or down [[Drainage|drains]]. Because of concerns about these sediments in the water and other issues, tailings ponds came into use.  The sustainability challenge in the management of tailings and waste rock is to dispose of material, such that it is inert or, if not, stable and contained, to minimise water and energy inputs and the surface footprint of wastes and to move toward finding alternate uses.<ref name=\"Franks\" />\n\n===Tailings dams and ponds===\n{{see main|Tailings dam}}\nBounded by impoundments (an impoundment is a dam), these dams typically use \"local materials\" including the tailings themselves, and may be considered [[embankment dam]]s.<ref name=EPADesignDams/> Traditionally, the only option for tailings storage was to deal with a tailings slurry.{{Clarify|date=November 2009}} This slurry is a dilute stream of the tailings solids within water that was sent to the tailings storage area. The modern tailings designer has a range of tailings products to choose from depending upon how much water is removed from the slurry prior to discharge.   The removal of water not only can create a better storage system in some cases (e.g. dry stacking, see below) but can also assist in water recovery which is a major issue as many mines are in arid regions. In a 1994 description of tailings impoundments, however, the U.S. EPA stated that dewatering methods may be prohibitively expensive except in special circumstances.<ref name=EPADesignDams/> Subaqueous storage of tailings has also been used.<ref name=EPADesignDams/>\n\nTailing ponds are areas of refused [[mining]] tailings where the waterborne refuse material is pumped into a [[pond]] to allow the [[sedimentation]] (meaning separation) of solids from the water. The pond is generally impounded with a dam, and known as tailings impoundments or tailings dams.<ref name=EPADesignDams>US EPA. (1994). [http://epa.gov/waste/nonhaz/industrial/special/mining/techdocs/tailings.pdf Technical Report: Design and Evaluation of Tailings Dams] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130510155552/http://epa.gov/waste/nonhaz/industrial/special/mining/techdocs/tailings.pdf |date=10 May 2013 }}.</ref> It was estimated in 2000 that there were about 3,500 active tailings impoundments in the world.<ref name=StewardDams/> The ponded water is of some benefit as it minimizes fine tailings from being transported by wind into populated areas where the toxic chemicals could be potentially hazardous to human health; however, it is also harmful to the environment. Tailing ponds are often somewhat dangerous because they attract wildlife such as waterfowl or caribou as they appear to be a natural pond, but they can be highly toxic and harmful to the health of these animals. Tailings ponds are used to store the waste made from separating minerals from rocks, or the slurry produced from tar sands mining. Tailings are sometimes mixed with other materials such as [[bentonite]] to form a thicker slurry that slows the release of impacted water to the environment.\n\nThere are many different subsets of this method, including valley impoundments, ring dikes, in-pit impoundments, and specially dug pits.<ref name=EPADesignDams/> The most common is the valley pond, which takes advantage of the natural topographical depression in the ground.<ref name=EPADesignDams/> Large earthen dams may be constructed and then filled with the tailings. Exhausted open pit mines may be refilled with tailings. In all instances, due consideration must be made to contamination of the underlying water table, amongst other issues. Dewatering is an important part of pond storage, as the tailings are added to the storage facility the water is removed - usually by draining into decant tower structures. The water removed can thus be reused in the processing cycle. Once a storage facility is filled and completed, the surface can be covered with topsoil and revegetation commenced. However, unless a non-permeable capping method is used, water that infiltrates into the storage facility will have to be continually pumped out into the future.\n\n===Paste tailings===\nPaste tailings is a modification to the conventional methods of disposal of tailings (pond storage). Conventional tailings slurries are composed of a low percent of solids and relatively high water content (normally ranging from 20% to 60% solids for most hard rock mining) and when deposited into the tailings pond the solids and liquids separate. In paste tailings the percent of solids in the tailings slurry is increased through the use of paste thickeners to produce a product where the minimal separation of water and solids occurs and the material is deposited into a storage area as a paste (with a consistency somewhat like toothpaste). Paste tailings has the advantage that more water is recycled in the processing plant and therefore the process is more water efficient than conventional tailings and there is a lower potential for seepage. However the cost of the thickening is generally higher than for conventional tailings and the pumping costs for the paste  are also normally higher than for conventional tailings as positive displacement pumps are normally required to transport the tailings from the processing plant to the storage area. Paste tailings are used in several locations around the world including Sunrise Dam in Western Australia and Bulyanhulu Gold Mine in Tanzania.<ref>{{citation|first1 = J. A. | last1 = Theriault | last2= Frostiak |first2=J. |last3=Welch |first3=D. | title = Surface Disposal of Paste Tailings at the Bulyanhulu Gold Mine, Tanzania}}</ref>\n\n===Dry stacking===\nTailings do not have to be stored in ponds or sent as slurries into oceans, rivers or streams. There is a growing use of the practice of dewatering tailings using vacuum or pressure filters so the tailings can then be stacked.<ref>{{cite conference | first = M. P. | last = Davies |last2=Rice |first2=S.  | title = An alternative to conventional tailing management - \"dry stack\" filtered tailings | conference = Proceedings of the Eighth International Conference on Tailings and Mine Waste | pages = 411\u2013422 | publisher = Balkema | date = 16\u201319 January 2001 | location = Fort Collins, Colorado, US}}</ref> This saves water which potentially reduces the impacts on the environment in terms of a reduction in the potential seepage rates, space used, leaves the tailings in a dense and stable arrangement and eliminates the long-term liability that ponds leave after mining is finished. However although there are potential merits to  dry stacked tailings these systems are often cost prohibitive due to increased capital cost to purchase and install the filter systems and the increase in operating costs (generally associated electricity consumption and consumables such as filter cloth) of such systems.\n\n===Storage in underground workings===\nWhile disposal into exhausted open pits is generally a straightforward operation, disposal into underground voids is more complex. A common modern approach is to mix a certain quantity of tailings with waste aggregate and cement, creating a product that can be used to backfill underground voids and [[Stoping (mining method)|stopes]]. A common term for this is HDPF - High Density Paste Fill. HDPF is a more expensive method of tailings disposal than pond storage, however it has many other benefits \u2013 not just environmental but it can significantly increase the stability of underground excavations by providing a means for ground stress to be transmitted across voids - rather than having to pass around them \u2013 which can cause mining induced seismic events like that suffered previously at the [[Beaconsfield Mine Disaster]].\n\n===Riverine tailings===\nUsually called RTD \u2013 Riverine Tailings Disposal. In most environments, not a particularly environmentally sound practice, it has seen significant utilisation in the past, leading to such spectacular environmental damage as done by the [[Mount Lyell Mining and Railway Company]] in [[Tasmania]] to the [[King River (Tasmania)|King River]], or the poisoning from the [[Panguna]] mine on [[Bougainville Island]], which led to large-scale civil unrest on the island, and the eventual permanent closing of the mine.<ref name=\"collapse\" />\n\nAs of 2005, only three mines operated by international companies continued to use river disposal: The [[Ok Tedi mine]], the [[Grasberg mine]]<ref name=\"collapse\" /> and the [[Porgera Gold Mine|Porgera mine]], all on New Guinea. This method is used in these cases due to seismic activity and landslide dangers which make other disposal methods impractical and dangerous.\n\n===Submarine tailings===\nCommonly referred to as STD (Submarine Tailings Disposal) or DSTD (Deep Sea Tailings Disposal). Tailings can be conveyed using a pipeline then discharged so as to eventually descend into the depths. Practically, it is not an ideal method, as the close proximity to off-shelf depths is rare. When STD is used, the depth of discharge is often what would be considered{{by whom|date=August 2015}} shallow, and extensive damage to the seafloor can result due to covering by the tailings product.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Association|first1=California Mining|title=Mine waste management|date=1991|publisher=Lewis Publishers|location=Chelsea, Mich.|isbn=9780873717465}}</ref> It is also critical{{according to|date=August 2015}} to control the density and temperature of the tailings product, to prevent it from travelling long distances, or even floating to the surface.\n\nThis method is used by the gold mine on [[Lihir Island]]; its waste disposal has been viewed by environmentalists as highly damaging, while the owners claim that it is not harmful.<ref name=\"collapse\" />\n\n=== Phytostabilisation ===\nPhytostabilisation is a form of [[phytoremediation]] that uses [[hyperaccumulator|hyperaccumulator plants]] for long-term stabilisation and containment of tailings, by sequestering pollutants in soil near the roots. The plant's presence can reduce wind erosion, or the plant's roots can prevent water erosion, immobilise metals by adsorption or accumulation, and provide a zone around the roots where the metals can precipitate and stabilise. Pollutants become less bioavailable and livestock, wildlife, and human exposure is reduced. This approach can be especially useful in dry environments, which are subject to wind and water dispersion.<ref>{{cite journal |journal= Environ Health Perspect |year=2008 |volume=116 |issue=3 |pages=278\u201383 |title= Phytostabilization of Mine Tailings in Arid and Semiarid Environments\u2014An Emerging Remediation Technology |author=Mendez MO, Maier RM |doi=10.1289/ehp.10608 |pmid= 18335091 |pmc= 2265025}}</ref>\n\n===Different methods===\nConsiderable effort and research continues to be made into discovering and refining better methods of tailings disposal. Research at the Porgera Gold Mine is focusing on developing a method of combining tailings products with coarse waste rock and waste muds to create a product that can be stored on the surface in generic-looking waste dumps or stockpiles. This would allow the current use of rivering disposal to cease. Considerable work remains to be done.   However, co-disposal has been successfully implemented by several designers including [[AMEC]] at, for example, the Elkview Mine in British Columbia.\n\n== Reprocessing ==\nAs mining techniques and the price of minerals improve, it is not unusual for tailings to be reprocessed using new methods, or more thoroughly with old methods, to recover additional minerals. Extensive tailings dumps of [[Kalgoorlie]] / Boulder in Western Australia were re-processed profitably in the 1990s by KalTails Mining.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.tailings.info/kaltails.htm|title=Kaltails project, Kalgoorlie, Western Australia|author=J.Engels & D.Dixon-Hardy|accessdate=19 October 2009|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100124082713/http://www.tailings.info/kaltails.htm|archive-date=24 January 2010|url-status=dead|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\nA machine called the PET4K Processing Plant has been used in a variety of countries for the past 20 years to remediate contaminated tailings.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://missoulian.com/news/state-and-regional/can-african-machine-produce-a-promising-future-in-butte/article_a2d81c9d-38ec-5262-ad36-2b8ac9ed27fa.html#tncms-source=infinity-scroll-summary-siderail-latest|title=Can African machine produce a promising future in Butte?|last=Smith|first=Mike|date=2017-09-25|work=[[Missoulian]]|access-date=2017-09-25|language=en}}</ref>\n\n==Pond reclamation by microbiology==\nDuring extraction of the oil from oil sand, tailings consisting of water, silt, clays and other solvents are also created. This solid will become mature fine tailings by gravity. Foght ''et al'' (1985) estimated that there are 10<sup>3</sup> anaerobic [[heterotrophs]] and 10<sup>4</sup> sulfate-reducing [[prokaryotes]] per milliliter in the tailings pond, based on conventional most probable number methods. Foght set up an experiment with two tailings ponds and an analysis of the [[archaea]], [[bacteria]], and the gas released from tailings ponds showed that those were [[methanogens]]. As the depth increased, the moles of CH<sub>4</sub> released actually decreased.<ref>Foght, J.M., Fedorak, P.M., Westlake, D.W.S., and Boerger, H.J. 1985. '' Microbial content and metabolic activities in the Syncrude tailings pond.'' AOSTRA J. Res. 1: 139\u2013146.</ref>\n\nSiddique (2006, 2007) states that methanogens in the tailings pond live and reproduce by anaerobic degradation, which will lower the molecular weight from [[naphtha]] to [[Aliphatic compound|aliphatic]], aromatic hydrocarbons, carbon dioxide and methane. Those archaea and bacteria can degrade the naphtha, which was considered as waste during the procedure of refining oil. Both of those degraded products are useful. Aliphatic, aromatic hydrocarbons and methane can be used as fuel in the humans\u2019 daily lives. In other words, these methanogens improve the coefficient of utilization. Moreover, these methanogens change the structure of the tailings pond and help the pore water efflux to be reused for processing oil sands. Because the archaea and bacteria metabolize and release bubbles within the tailings, the pore water can go through the soil easily. Since they accelerate the densification of mature fine tailings, the tailings ponds are enabled to settle the solids more quickly so that the tailings can be reclaimed earlier. Moreover, the water released from the tailings can be used in the procedure of refining oil. Reducing the demand of water can also protect the environment from drought.<ref>See: Holowenko, F.M., MacKinnon, M.D., and Fedorak, P.M. 2000.

The chemical 2,4,5-[[trichlorophenol]] ('''2''') was being produced there from [[1,2,4,5-tetrachlorobenzene]] ('''1''') by the [[nucleophilic aromatic substitution]] reaction with [[sodium hydroxide]]. The 2,4,5-trichlorophenol was intended as an intermediate for [[hexachlorophene]].<ref name = \"Homberger\">{{cite journal | last = Homberger | first = E. |author2=Reggiani, G. |author3=Sambeth, J. |author4=Wipf, H.

The exhaust steam pressure was normally 12 bar and temperature 190&nbsp;\u00b0C, which resulted in a reaction mixture temperature of 158&nbsp;\u00b0C, very close to its boiling point of 160&nbsp;\u00b0C. Safety testing showed the onset of an [[exothermic reaction|exothermic]] side reaction if the reaction mixture temperature reached 230&nbsp;\u00b0C. Crucially, no steam temperature reading was made available to plant operators responsible for the reactor.\n\nThe chemical-release accident occurred when a batch process was interrupted prior to the completion of the final step&nbsp;\u2013 removal of [[ethylene glycol]] from the reaction mixture by [[distillation]], due to conformance with an Italian law requiring shutdown of plant operations over the weekend. Other parts of the site had already started to close down as the processing of other batches finished, which reduced power consumption across the plant, causing a dramatic drop in the load on the turbine and a consequent increase in the temperature of the exhaust steam to around 300&nbsp;\u00b0C. This much hotter steam then proceeded to heat the portion of the metal wall of the accident reactor above the level of the liquid within it to the same temperature. Not having a steam temperature reading among their instruments, operators of the reactor were unaware of the presence of this additional heating, and they stopped the batch as they normally would&nbsp;\u2013 by isolating the steam and turning off the stirrer in the reactor vessel. The abnormally-hot upper region of the reactor jacket then heated the adjacent reaction mixture. With the stirrer not running, the heating was highly localised&nbsp;\u2013 confined to just the portion of the upper layers of reaction mixture adjacent to the reactor wall, and increased the local temperature to the critical temperature for the exothermic side reaction seen in testing. Indeed, the critical temperature proved to be only 180&nbsp;\u00b0C, 50&nbsp;\u00b0C lower than believed. At that lower critical temperature, a slow runaway decomposition began, releasing more heat and leading to the onset of a rapid [[Thermal runaway|runaway reaction]] when the temperature reached 230&nbsp;\u00b0C seven hours later.<ref>{{cite book |first=Trevor |last=Kletz |authorlink=Trevor Kletz |title=What Went Wrong?

Shortly after ICMESA began to pay the first compensations to those affected. Later that spring decontamination operations were initiated and in June a system epidemiological health monitoring for 220,000 people was launched. They then used trichlorophenol to make a drug to fight the skin infections, which they tested in dogs.\n[[File:Monza-Paolo-Paoletti-targa-1980.jpg|thumb|right]]\nIn June 1978, the Italian government raised its special loan from 40 to 115 billion lire. By the end of the year, most individual compensation claims had been settled [[out of court]]. On February 5, 1980, [[Paolo Paoletti]]&nbsp;\u2013 the Director of Production at ICMESA&nbsp;\u2013 was shot and killed in [[Monza]] by a member of the Italian radical left-wing terrorist organization [[Prima Linea]].<ref>{{cite web| first=F| last=Robbe| url=http://www.itacaedizioni.it/catalogo/seveso-1976/| title=Seveso 1976.

The total amount would reach 20 billion [[Italian lira|lire]].\n\n===Waste from the cleanup===\nThe waste from the clean up of the plant was a mixture of [[protective clothing]] and chemical residues from the plant. This waste was packed into waste drums which had been designed for the storage of [[nuclear waste]]. It was agreed that the waste would be disposed of in a legal manner.\n\nTo this end, in spring 1982, the firm Mannesmann Italiana was contracted to dispose of the contaminated chemicals from Zone A.  Mannesmann Italiana made it a condition that Givaudan would not be notified of the disposal site which prompted Givaudan to insist that a [[notary public]] certify the disposal. On September 9, 41 barrels of toxic waste left the ICMESA premises. On December 13, the notary gave a sworn statement that the barrels had been disposed of in an approved way.\n\nHowever, in February 1983, the programme ''A bon entendeur'' on [[T\u00e9l\u00e9vision Suisse Romande]], a [[French language]] [[Switzerland|Swiss]] television channel, followed the route of the barrels to [[Saint-Quentin, Aisne|Saint-Quentin]] in northern [[France]] where they disappeared. A public debate ensued in which numerous theories were put forward when it was found that Mannesmann Italiana had hired two subcontractors to get rid of the toxic waste. On May 19, the 41 barrels were found in an unused [[abattoir]] (slaughterhouse) in [[Anguilcourt-le-Sart]], a village in northern France. From there they were transferred to a French military base near [[Sissonne]]. The Roche Group (parent firm of Givaudan) took it upon itself to properly dispose of the waste. On November 25, over nine years after the disaster, the Roche Group issued a public statement that the toxic waste consisting of 42 barrels (1 was added earlier that year) had all been [[incinerate]]d in [[Switzerland]].  According to ''[[New Scientist]]'', it was thought that the high chlorine content of the waste might cause damage to the high temperature incinerator used by Roche, but Roche stated that they would burn the waste in the incinerator and repair it afterward if it were damaged. They stated that they wanted to take responsibility for the safe destruction of the waste.\n\n===Criminal court case===\nIn September 1983, the Criminal Court of Monza sentenced five former employees of ICMESA or its parent company, [[Givaudan]], to prison sentences ranging from 2.5 years to 5 years. They all appealed.\n\nIn May 1985, the Court of Appeal in Milan found three of the five accused not guilty; the two still facing prosecution appealed to the Supreme Court in Rome.\n\nOn May 23, 1986, the Supreme Court in Rome confirmed the judgment against the two remaining defendants, even though the prosecuting attorney had called for their acquittal.\n\n==Aftermath==\nAfter the incident, ICMESA initially refused to admit that the dioxin release had occurred. At least a week passed before a public statement was issued that dioxin had been emitted, and another week passed before an evacuation began.  Even then, the government was saddled with the responsibility of determining the boundaries of the evacuation area, and thereafter to organise the evacuation.  This constituted a major imposition on the community as well as on government resources.\n   \nIt was soon recognized that the factory's very rudimentary safety systems had been designed with little more than simple explosion prevention in mind.  Environmental protection had not been considered.  Nor had any consideration been given as to setting up any type of warning system or health-protection protocols for the local community.  As a result, the local population was caught unaware when the accident happened, and thus was unprepared to cope with the danger of an invisible poison.\n \n<blockquote>In the context of such heightened tensions, Seveso became a microcosm where all the existing conflicts within society (political, institutional, religious, industrial) were reflected. However, within a relatively short time, such conflicts abated and the recovery of the community proceeded. For, in Seveso, the responsible party was known from the outset and soon offered reparation. Moreover, the eventual disappearance of the offending factory itself and the physical exportation of the toxic substances and polluted soil enabled the community to feel cleansed. The resolution of the emotional after-effects of the trauma, so necessary for the recovery of a community, was facilitated by these favourable circumstances.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://archive.unu.edu/unupress/unupbooks/uu21le/uu21le0a.htm|title=Conclusion: \"Seveso\" - A paradoxical symbol|publisher=United Nations University|author=B.

Ravetz }}</ref></blockquote>\n \nIndustrial safety regulations were passed in the [[European Community]] in 1982 called the [[Directive 82/501/EC|Seveso Directive]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://mahbsrv.jrc.it/downloads-pdf%5CSeveso1-LEG-EN.pdf|title=Original Seveso Directive 82/501/EEC (\"Seveso I\")|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060510001118/http://mahbsrv.jrc.it/downloads-pdf/Seveso1-LEG-EN.pdf|archivedate=2006-05-10}}</ref> which imposed much harsher industrial regulations. The Seveso Directive was updated in 1996, 2008 and 2012 and is currently referred to as the [[Directive 2012/18/EU|Seveso III Directive]] (or [[COMAH Regulations]] in the United Kingdom).\n \nTreatment of the soil in the affected areas is now considered complete, since the dioxin levels are now below background. The entire site has been turned into a public park known as Seveso Oak Forest Park.  This area is permanently off-limits to development. There are two artificial hills in the park; today, underneath these hills are the toxic remnants (including destroyed houses, tons of contaminated soil, and animal remains), all protected in a concrete sarcophagus.  Investigations into site conditions have confirmed that the sarcophagus life expectancy of 300 years is expected, appropriate, and required.{{cn|date=December 2019}}\n \nSeveral studies have been completed on the health of the population of surrounding communities. While it has been established that people from Seveso exposed to TCDD are more susceptible to certain rare cancers, when all types of cancers are grouped into one category, no statistically significant increase has yet been reported in any specific cancer category. This indicates that more research is needed to determine the true long-term health effects on the affected population.\n   \nEpidemiological monitoring programmes were established as follows (with termination dates): abortions (1982); malformations (1982); tumours (1997); deaths (1997). Health monitoring of workers at ICMESA and on decontamination projects, and [[chloracne]] sufferers (1985).\n   \nThe Seveso disaster gives valuable comparative insight into the effects of [[Agent Orange]] on [[flora]] and [[fauna]] in [[Vietnam]], not to mention the Vietnamese people, as TCDD was a significant contaminant in Agent Orange.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.vn-agentorange.org/brochure.html|title=Vietnam Agent Orange Campaign - Background|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060821134649/http://www.vn-agentorange.org/brochure.html|archivedate=2006-08-21}}</ref>\n \nThe documentary ''Gambit''<ref> Gambit (2005), German Wikipedia page.  https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gambit_(2005), accessed (in German) on December 28, 2019.</ref><ref> Gambit (August 2005), Sabine Gisiger, Swiss Films Review.  https://www.swissfilms.ch/en/film_search/filmdetails/-/id_film/-1704568495 </ref> is about J\u00f6rg Sambeth, the technical director of ICMESA, who was sentenced to five years in the first trial, and had his sentence reduced to two years and was paroled on appeal.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.taz.de/pt/2006/07/10/a0137.1/text.ges,1|title=Ich war absolut dumm|pages=4|language=German|newspaper=Die Tageszeitung: Taz|date=2006-07-10}}</ref>\n\n==See also==\n* [[Environmental inequality in Europe]]\n*''[[Inochi No Chikyuu: Dioxin No Natsu]]'' (a 2001 film about the incident)\n*\"Suffocation,\" the fifth track on the dystopian concept album, [[See You Later]], by  [[Vangelis]], is inspired by the Seveso disaster and features an emergency announcement in Italian to take shelter and a dialog between a man and woman set during the unfolding of the disaster.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://songmeanings.com/songs/view/3530822107858976964/|title=Original Italian lyrics with English translation|date=June 2019|website=Song Meanings}}</ref>\n*\"Seveso Directive\", one of three [[Directive (European Union)|European Union Directives]] to improve the safety of sites containing large quantities of dangerous substances:\n**[[Directive 82/501/EC]], also known as the \"Seveso Directive\"\n**[[Directive 96/82/EC]], also known as the \"Seveso II Directive\"\n**[[Directive 2012/18/EU]], also known as the \"Seveso III Directive\"\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n==Further reading==\n*{{cite book|last=Fuller|first=John G.|title=Poison That Fell from the Sky|location=New York|publisher=Berkley Books|year=1979|isbn=0-425-04013-5}}\n*{{cite book|last=Robbe|first=Federico|title=Seveso 1976.

The factory building had been built many years earlier and the local population did not perceive it as a potential source of danger. Moreover, although several exposures of populations to [[dioxin]]s had occurred before, mostly in industrial accidents, they were of a more limited scale.\n\n==Chemical events==\n:[[File:Seveso reaction.PNG|500px|Overall Reaction scheme]]\n\nThe accident occurred in the chemical plant's ''building B''. The chemical 2,4,5-[[trichlorophenol]] ('''2''') was being produced there from [[1,2,4,5-tetrachlorobenzene]] ('''1''') by the [[nucleophilic aromatic substitution]] reaction with [[sodium hydroxide]]. The 2,4,5-trichlorophenol was intended as an intermediate for [[hexachlorophene]].<ref name = \"Homberger\">{{cite journal | last = Homberger | first = E. |author2=Reggiani, G. |author3=Sambeth, J. |author4=Wipf, H.

The exhaust steam pressure was normally 12 bar and temperature 190&nbsp;\u00b0C, which resulted in a reaction mixture temperature of 158&nbsp;\u00b0C, very close to its boiling point of 160&nbsp;\u00b0C. Safety testing showed the onset of an [[exothermic reaction|exothermic]] side reaction if the reaction mixture temperature reached 230&nbsp;\u00b0C. Crucially, no steam temperature reading was made available to plant operators responsible for the reactor.\n\nThe chemical-release accident occurred when a batch process was interrupted prior to the completion of the final step&nbsp;\u2013 removal of [[ethylene glycol]] from the reaction mixture by [[distillation]], due to conformance with an Italian law requiring shutdown of plant operations over the weekend. Other parts of the site had already started to close down as the processing of other batches finished, which reduced power consumption across the plant, causing a dramatic drop in the load on the turbine and a consequent increase in the temperature of the exhaust steam to around 300&nbsp;\u00b0C. This much hotter steam then proceeded to heat the portion of the metal wall of the accident reactor above the level of the liquid within it to the same temperature. Not having a steam temperature reading among their instruments, operators of the reactor were unaware of the presence of this additional heating, and they stopped the batch as they normally would&nbsp;\u2013 by isolating the steam and turning off the stirrer in the reactor vessel. The abnormally-hot upper region of the reactor jacket then heated the adjacent reaction mixture. With the stirrer not running, the heating was highly localised&nbsp;\u2013 confined to just the portion of the upper layers of reaction mixture adjacent to the reactor wall, and increased the local temperature to the critical temperature for the exothermic side reaction seen in testing. Indeed, the critical temperature proved to be only 180&nbsp;\u00b0C, 50&nbsp;\u00b0C lower than believed. At that lower critical temperature, a slow runaway decomposition began, releasing more heat and leading to the onset of a rapid [[Thermal runaway|runaway reaction]] when the temperature reached 230&nbsp;\u00b0C seven hours later.<ref>{{cite book |first=Trevor |last=Kletz |authorlink=Trevor Kletz |title=What Went Wrong?

Shortly after ICMESA began to pay the first compensations to those affected. Later that spring decontamination operations were initiated and in June a system epidemiological health monitoring for 220,000 people was launched. They then used trichlorophenol to make a drug to fight the skin infections, which they tested in dogs.\n[[File:Monza-Paolo-Paoletti-targa-1980.jpg|thumb|right]]\nIn June 1978, the Italian government raised its special loan from 40 to 115 billion lire. By the end of the year, most individual compensation claims had been settled [[out of court]]. On February 5, 1980, [[Paolo Paoletti]]&nbsp;\u2013 the Director of Production at ICMESA&nbsp;\u2013 was shot and killed in [[Monza]] by a member of the Italian radical left-wing terrorist organization [[Prima Linea]].<ref>{{cite web| first=F| last=Robbe| url=http://www.itacaedizioni.it/catalogo/seveso-1976/| title=Seveso 1976. Oltre la diossina| publisher=Itaca| date=2016| pages=119\u2013120}}</ref> \n  \nOn 19 December 1980, representatives of the Region of Lombardy/Italian Republic and Givaudan/ICMESA signed a compensation agreement in the presence of the prime minister of Italy, [[Arnaldo Forlani]]. The total amount would reach 20 billion [[Italian lira|lire]].\n\n===Waste from the cleanup===\nThe waste from the clean up of the plant was a mixture of [[protective clothing]] and chemical residues from the plant. This waste was packed into waste drums which had been designed for the storage of [[nuclear waste]]. It was agreed that the waste would be disposed of in a legal manner.\n\nTo this end, in spring 1982, the firm Mannesmann Italiana was contracted to dispose of the contaminated chemicals from Zone A.  Mannesmann Italiana made it a condition that Givaudan would not be notified of the disposal site which prompted Givaudan to insist that a [[notary public]] certify the disposal. On September 9, 41 barrels of toxic waste left the ICMESA premises. On December 13, the notary gave a sworn statement that the barrels had been disposed of in an approved way.\n\nHowever, in February 1983, the programme ''A bon entendeur'' on [[T\u00e9l\u00e9vision Suisse Romande]], a [[French language]] [[Switzerland|Swiss]] television channel, followed the route of the barrels to [[Saint-Quentin, Aisne|Saint-Quentin]] in northern [[France]] where they disappeared. A public debate ensued in which numerous theories were put forward when it was found that Mannesmann Italiana had hired two subcontractors to get rid of the toxic waste. On May 19, the 41 barrels were found in an unused [[abattoir]] (slaughterhouse) in [[Anguilcourt-le-Sart]], a village in northern France. From there they were transferred to a French military base near [[Sissonne]]. The Roche Group (parent firm of Givaudan) took it upon itself to properly dispose of the waste. On November 25, over nine years after the disaster, the Roche Group issued a public statement that the toxic waste consisting of 42 barrels (1 was added earlier that year) had all been [[incinerate]]d in [[Switzerland]].  According to ''[[New Scientist]]'', it was thought that the high chlorine content of the waste might cause damage to the high temperature incinerator used by Roche, but Roche stated that they would burn the waste in the incinerator and repair it afterward if it were damaged. They stated that they wanted to take responsibility for the safe destruction of the waste.\n\n===Criminal court case===\nIn September 1983, the Criminal Court of Monza sentenced five former employees of ICMESA or its parent company, [[Givaudan]], to prison sentences ranging from 2.5 years to 5 years. They all appealed.\n\nIn May 1985, the Court of Appeal in Milan found three of the five accused not guilty; the two still facing prosecution appealed to the Supreme Court in Rome.\n\nOn May 23, 1986, the Supreme Court in Rome confirmed the judgment against the two remaining defendants, even though the prosecuting attorney had called for their acquittal.\n\n==Aftermath==\nAfter the incident, ICMESA initially refused to admit that the dioxin release had occurred. At least a week passed before a public statement was issued that dioxin had been emitted, and another week passed before an evacuation began.  Even then, the government was saddled with the responsibility of determining the boundaries of the evacuation area, and thereafter to organise the evacuation.  This constituted a major imposition on the community as well as on government resources.\n   \nIt was soon recognized that the factory's very rudimentary safety systems had been designed with little more than simple explosion prevention in mind.  Environmental protection had not been considered.  Nor had any consideration been given as to setting up any type of warning system or health-protection protocols for the local community.  As a result, the local population was caught unaware when the accident happened, and thus was unprepared to cope with the danger of an invisible poison.\n \n<blockquote>In the context of such heightened tensions, Seveso became a microcosm where all the existing conflicts within society (political, institutional, religious, industrial) were reflected. However, within a relatively short time, such conflicts abated and the recovery of the community proceeded. For, in Seveso, the responsible party was known from the outset and soon offered reparation. Moreover, the eventual disappearance of the offending factory itself and the physical exportation of the toxic substances and polluted soil enabled the community to feel cleansed. The resolution of the emotional after-effects of the trauma, so necessary for the recovery of a community, was facilitated by these favourable circumstances.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://archive.unu.edu/unupress/unupbooks/uu21le/uu21le0a.htm|title=Conclusion: \"Seveso\" - A paradoxical symbol|publisher=United Nations University|author=B.

Ravetz }}</ref></blockquote>\n \nIndustrial safety regulations were passed in the [[European Community]] in 1982 called the [[Directive 82/501/EC|Seveso Directive]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://mahbsrv.jrc.it/downloads-pdf%5CSeveso1-LEG-EN.pdf|title=Original Seveso Directive 82/501/EEC (\"Seveso I\")|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060510001118/http://mahbsrv.jrc.it/downloads-pdf/Seveso1-LEG-EN.pdf|archivedate=2006-05-10}}</ref> which imposed much harsher industrial regulations. The Seveso Directive was updated in 1996, 2008 and 2012 and is currently referred to as the [[Directive 2012/18/EU|Seveso III Directive]] (or [[COMAH Regulations]] in the United Kingdom).\n \nTreatment of the soil in the affected areas is now considered complete, since the dioxin levels are now below background. The entire site has been turned into a public park known as Seveso Oak Forest Park.  This area is permanently off-limits to development. There are two artificial hills in the park; today, underneath these hills are the toxic remnants (including destroyed houses, tons of contaminated soil, and animal remains), all protected in a concrete sarcophagus.  Investigations into site conditions have confirmed that the sarcophagus life expectancy of 300 years is expected, appropriate, and required.{{cn|date=December 2019}}\n \nSeveral studies have been completed on the health of the population of surrounding communities. While it has been established that people from Seveso exposed to TCDD are more susceptible to certain rare cancers, when all types of cancers are grouped into one category, no statistically significant increase has yet been reported in any specific cancer category. This indicates that more research is needed to determine the true long-term health effects on the affected population.\n   \nEpidemiological monitoring programmes were established as follows (with termination dates): abortions (1982); malformations (1982); tumours (1997); deaths (1997). Health monitoring of workers at ICMESA and on decontamination projects, and [[chloracne]] sufferers (1985).\n   \nThe Seveso disaster gives valuable comparative insight into the effects of [[Agent Orange]] on [[flora]] and [[fauna]] in [[Vietnam]], not to mention the Vietnamese people, as TCDD was a significant contaminant in Agent Orange.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.vn-agentorange.org/brochure.html|title=Vietnam Agent Orange Campaign - Background|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060821134649/http://www.vn-agentorange.org/brochure.html|archivedate=2006-08-21}}</ref>\n \nThe documentary ''Gambit'' <ref> Gambit (2005), German Wikipedia page.  https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gambit_(2005), accessed (in German) on December 28, 2019.</ref> <ref> Gambit (August 2005), Sabine Gisiger, Swiss Films Review.  https://www.swissfilms.ch/en/film_search/filmdetails/-/id_film/-1704568495 </ref> is about J\u00f6rg Sambeth, the technical director of ICMESA, who was sentenced to five years in the first trial, and had his sentence reduced to two years and was paroled on appeal.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.taz.de/pt/2006/07/10/a0137.1/text.ges,1|title=Ich war absolut dumm|pages=4|language=German|newspaper=Die Tageszeitung: Taz|date=2006-07-10}}</ref>\n\n==See also==\n* [[Environmental inequality in Europe]]\n*''[[Inochi No Chikyuu: Dioxin No Natsu]]'' (a 2001 film about the incident)\n*\"Suffocation,\" the fifth track on the dystopian concept album, [[See You Later]], by  [[Vangelis]], is inspired by the Seveso disaster and features an emergency announcement in Italian to take shelter and a dialog between a man and woman set during the unfolding of the disaster.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://songmeanings.com/songs/view/3530822107858976964/|title=Original Italian lyrics with English translation|date=June 2019|website=Song Meanings}}</ref>\n*\"Seveso Directive\", one of three [[Directive (European Union)|European Union Directives]] to improve the safety of sites containing large quantities of dangerous substances:\n**[[Directive 82/501/EC]], also known as the \"Seveso Directive\"\n**[[Directive 96/82/EC]], also known as the \"Seveso II Directive\"\n**[[Directive 2012/18/EU]], also known as the \"Seveso III Directive\"\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n==Further reading==\n*{{cite book|last=Fuller|first=John G.|title=Poison That Fell from the Sky|location=New York|publisher=Berkley Books|year=1979|isbn=0-425-04013-5}}\n*{{cite book|last=Robbe|first=Federico|title=Seveso 1976.

Wu was the only [[queen regnant|empress regnant]] (or female [[Emperor of China|emperor]]) in the [[history of China]].\n\nWu was the concubine of [[Emperor Taizong of Tang|Emperor Taizong]]. After his death, she married his successor\u2014his ninth son, [[Emperor Gaozong of Tang|Emperor Gaozong]], officially becoming Gaozong's ''[[Imperial consorts of Tang China|huanghou]]'' ({{lang|zh|\u7687\u540e}}, empress consort, title for the reigning emperor's main consort) in 655, although having considerable political power prior to this. After Gaozong's debilitating stroke in 660, Wu Zetian became administrator of the court, a position equal to the emperor's until 705.<ref name=\"Paludan, 96\">{{harvp|Paludan|1998|p=96}}</ref>\n\nAfter her wedding to [[Emperor Gaozong of Tang|Emperor Gaozong]] in 655, Empress  Wu's rise to power was swift. A strong, charismatic, and well-educated woman who enjoyed the absolute interest of her husband, Empress  Wu was the most powerful and influential woman at court during a period when the Tang Empire was at the peak of its power and glory. More decisive and proactive than her husband, she is considered by historians to have been the real [[power behind the throne]] and [[ruling figure]] for more than eighteen years. Empress  Wu was granted certain honours and privileges which were not enjoyed by any Chinese empresses before or after And after Gauzong's death, Empress Wu as Empress dowager and regent conquered power independently and uniquely, and seven years later, she seized the throne in the Zhou dynasty, and becoming the only female emperor in Chinese history.\n\nThe importance to history of Wu Zetian's period of political and military leadership includes the major expansion of the Chinese empire, extending it far beyond its previous territorial limits, deep into [[Central Asia]], and engaging in a series of wars on the [[Korean Peninsula]], first [[Goguryeo\u2013Tang War|allying with Silla against Goguryeo]], and then [[Silla\u2013Tang War|against Silla]] over the occupation of former [[Goguryeo]] territory. Within China, besides the more direct consequences of her struggle to gain and maintain supreme power, Wu's leadership resulted in important effects regarding social class in Chinese society and in relation to state support for [[Taoism]], [[Buddhism]], education, and literature. Wu Zetian also had a monumental impact upon the statuary of the [[Longmen Grottoes]] and the \"Wordless Stele\" at the [[Qianling Mausoleum]], as well as the construction of some major buildings and bronze castings that no longer survive.\n\nBesides her career as a political leader, Wu Zetian also had an active family life. Although family relationships sometimes became problematic, Wu Zetian was the mother of four sons, three of whom also carried the title of emperor, although one held that title only as a posthumous honor.

A difficulty in English translations from Chinese is that English translations tend to specify gender (as in the case of \"emperor\" versus \"empress\" or \"prince\" versus \"princess\"); whereas, in [[Classical Chinese]], words such as ''hou'' ({{lang|zh|\u540e}}, \"sovereign\", \"prince\", \"queen\") or ''huangdi'' {{lang|zh|(\u7687\u5e1d}}, \"imperial supreme ruler\", \"royal deity\") are of a [[Grammatical gender#Indeterminate gender|grammatically indeterminate gender]].\n\n=== Names ===\nThe exact birth name of Wu Zetian is no longer retrievable.

Wu was her patronymic surname, which she retained, according to traditional Chinese practice, after marriage to Gaozong, of the Li family. Emperor Taizong gave her the [[art name]] Wu Mei ({{lang|zh|\u6b66\u5a9a}}), meaning \"glamorous\".<ref name=\"NBT76\" /> (Thus, today Chinese people often refer to her as Wu Mei or Wu Meiniang ({{lang|zh|\u6b66\u5a9a\u5a18}}) when they write about her youth, whereas they refer to her as Wu Hou ({{lang|zh|\u6b66\u540e}}) when referring to her as empress consort and empress dowager, and Wu Zetian ({{lang|zh|\u6b66\u5247\u5929}}) when referring to her reign as empress regnant.){{Citation needed|date=February 2008}}\n\n=== Titles  ===\nDuring her life, and posthumously, Wu Zetian was awarded various official titles.

Generally, the monarch was male and his chief spouse was given a title such as ''huanghou'' ({{lang|zh|\u7687\u540e}}), often translated as \"empress\" or more specific \"empress consort\". Upon the death of the emperor, the surviving empress consort could become [[empress dowager]], sometimes wielding considerable political power as [[Regency (government)|regent]] during the [[Minority reign|minority]] of the (male) heir to the position of emperor.\n\nSince the time of [[Qin Shi Huang]] (259\u2013210 BC) the [[Emperor of China]] used the title ''huangdi'' ({{lang|zh|\u7687\u5e1d}}, translated as \"emperor\" or \"empress (regnant)\" as appropriate).

In the same year, a [[List of solar eclipses in the 7th century|total eclipse of the sun]] was visible across China. Her father [[Wu Shihuo]] was engaged in the timber business and the family was relatively well off. Her mother was from the powerful Yang family. During the final years of [[Emperor Yang of Sui]], Li Yuan ({{lang|zh|\u674e\u6df5}}) (who would go on to become Emperor Gaozu of Tang) stayed in the Wu household many times and became close to the Wu family, whilst holding appointments in both Hedong and [[Taiyuan]]. After Li Yuan overthrew Emperor Yang, he was generous to the Wu family, providing them with money, grain, land, and clothing. Once the Tang dynasty became established, Wu Shihou held a succession of senior ministerial posts including governor of [[Yangzhou]], Lizhou, and Jingzhou ({{lang|zh|\u834a\u5dde}}) (modern day [[Jiangling County]], [[Hubei]]).\n\nWu Zetian was born into a rich family. She had servants at her disposal to perform routine tasks for her, so there were not many domestic jobs that Wu would ever have to learn. Because of this, Wu was encouraged by her father to read books and pursue her education. He made sure that his daughter was well-educated, a trait that was not common among women, much less encouraged by their fathers{{Citation needed|date=March 2020}}. Wu did not seem to be the type of child who would want to sit quietly and do needlework or sip tea all day{{Citation needed|date=March 2020}}.

Wu grew and continued to learn as much as she could, with her father backing her every step of the way{{Citation needed|date=March 2020}}. At age fourteen, she was taken to be an imperial concubine (lesser wife) of [[Emperor Taizong of Tang]]. It was there that she became a type of secretary. This opportunity allowed her to continue to pursue her education.

Wu progressively gained Immeasurable influence over the governance of the empire throughout Emperor Gaozong's reign, and eventually she effectively was making the major decisions. She was regarded as ruthless in her endeavours to grab power and was believed by traditional historians even to have killed her own children but was actually false as these rumors came up 400 years after her death as ancient China could not accept that a women was in power\n\n[[File:Gaozong of Tang.jpg|thumb|upright|A depiction of Emperor Gaozong of Tang from ''An 18th century album of portraits of 86 emperors of China, with Chinese historical notes'']]\nGaozong became emperor at the age of 21.

Empress Wang, seeing that Emperor Gaozong was still impressed by Consort Wu's beauty, hoped that the arrival of a new concubine would divert the emperor from Consort Xiao, and therefore secretly told Consort Wu to stop shaving her hair and, at a later point, welcomed her to the palace. (Some modern historians dispute this traditional account, and some think that Consort Wu never had left the imperial palace and might have had an affair with Emperor Gaozong while Emperor Taizong was still alive.){{Citation needed|date=February 2008}}\n\nConsort Wu soon overtook Consort Xiao as Emperor Gaozong's favourite. In 652, she gave birth to her first child, a son named [[Li Hong]]. In 653, she gave birth to another son, [[Li Xian (prince)|Li Xi\u00e1n]]. Neither of these sons were in contention to be Emperor Gaozong's heir because Emperor Gaozong had, at the request of officials influenced by Empress Wang and her uncle, the chancellor [[Liu Shi (Tang dynasty)|Liu Shi]], designated his oldest son [[Li Zhong]] as his heir. Li Zhong's mother, Consort Liu, was of lowly birth and Empress Wang expected her gratitude. By 654, both Empress Wang and Consort Xiao had lost favour with Emperor Gaozong, and these two former romantic rivals joined forces against Consort Wu, but to no avail. As a sign of his love for Consort Wu, in 654 Emperor Gaozong conferred posthumous honors on her father [[Wu Shihuo]].\n\nAs the year 654 continued, shortly after Consort Wu had given birth to her daughter, the baby died, with some evidence suggesting deliberate [[Strangling|strangulation]], including allegations by Wu, the child's mother. Consort Wu accused Wang of murder.<ref name=\"Paludan, 96\" /> Wu's rival Wang was accused of having been seen near the child's room, with corroborating testimony by alleged eyewitnesses. Emperor Gaozong was led to believe that Wang had the means to kill the child, and likely done so, motivated by jealousy. Wang lacked an alibi, and was unable to clear herself. Angry, Emperor Gaozong considered deposing Empress Wang and elevating Consort Wu to her position; but, first he wanted to make sure that the government chancellors would support this. So, Gaozong visited the house of his uncle [[Zhangsun Wuji]], the head chancellor, together with Consort Wu (later Emperor Gaozong would award Chancellor Zhangsun with much treasure). During the meeting, Gaozong several times brought up the topic of Empress Wang's childlessness, a topic easily leading to an excuse sufficient to depose her; however, Zhangsun repeatedly found ways to divert the conversation. Subsequent visits by Consort Wu's mother Lady Yang and the official [[Xu Jingzong]], who was allied with Consort Wu, to seek support from Zhangsun also were to no avail.<ref name=\"ZZTJ199\">{{harvp|Zizhi Tongjian|1084|loc= [[:zh:s:\u8cc7\u6cbb\u901a\u9451/\u5377199|vol. 199]]}}</ref> Scientifically credible [[forensic pathology]] information about the death of the child does not exist, and scholars lack real, concrete evidence about her death. However, speculation seems to continue.\n\nAs traditional folklore tends to portray Wu as a power hungry woman with no care for who she hurt or what she did, the most popular theory is that Wu killed her own child in order to implicate Wang. Other schools of thought argue that Wang indeed killed the child out of jealousy and hatred toward Wu since Wang had no children of her own. The third argument is that the child died of [[asphyxiation]] or [[crib death]], considering that the ventilation systems of the time were non-existent or of poor quality. Lack of ventilation combined with using coal as a heating method could lead to a build-up of fumes that would lead to [[carbon monoxide poisoning]]. No matter what caused the death of the child, Wu blamed Wang for it and Wang was removed from her position as Empress.\n\nIn summer 655, Consort Wu accused Empress Wang and her mother, Lady Liu, of using witchcraft. In response, Emperor Gaozong barred Lady Liu from the palace and demoted Empress Wang's uncle, Liu Shi.<ref name=\"ZZTJ199\" /> Meanwhile, a faction of officials began to form around Consort Wu, including [[Li Yifu]], Xu, Cui Yixuan ({{lang|zh|\u5d14\u7fa9\u7384}}), and Yuan Gongyu ({{lang|zh|\u8881\u516c\u745c}}). On an occasion in the autumn of 655, Emperor Gaozong summoned the chancellors Zhangsun, [[Li Shiji|Li Ji]], [[Yu Zhining]], and [[Chu Suiliang]] to the palace\u2014which Chu deduced to be regarding the matter of changing who was the Empress. Li Ji claimed an illness and refused to attend. At the meeting, Chu vehemently opposed deposing Empress Wang, while Zhangsun and Yu showed their disapproval by silence. Meanwhile, other chancellors [[Han Yuan]] and [[Lai Ji]] also opposed the move, but when Emperor Gaozong asked Li Ji again, Li Ji's response was, \"This is your family matter, Your Imperial Majesty. Why ask anyone else?\" Emperor Gaozong, therefore, became resolved. He demoted Chu to be a commandant at [[Tanzhou (in modern Hunan)|Tan Prefecture]] (roughly modern [[Changsha]], [[Hunan]]),<ref name=\"ZZTJ199\" /> and then deposed both Empress Wang and Consort Xiao, putting them under arrest and creating Consort Wu as empress to replace Empress Wang. (Later that year, Empress Wang and Consort Xiao were killed on orders by the new Empress Wu after Emperor Gaozong showed signs of considering their release. After their deaths, however, Empress Wu often was haunted by them in her dreams.

She first had Xu and Li Yifu, who were by now chancellors, falsely accuse Han Yuan and Lai Ji of being complicit with Chu Suiliang in planning treason. The three of them, along with Liu Shi, were demoted to being prefects of remote prefectures, with provisions that they would never be allowed to return to Chang'an. In 659, she further had Xu accuse Zhangsun Wuji of plotting treason with the low-level officials Wei Jifang ({{lang|zh|\u97cb\u5b63\u65b9}}) and Li Chao ({{lang|zh|\u674e\u5de2}}). Zhangsun was exiled and, later in the year, was forced to commit suicide in exile. Xu further implicated Chu, Liu, Han, and Yu Zhining in the plot as well. Chu, who had died in 658, was posthumously stripped of his titles, and his sons Chu Yanfu ({{lang|zh|\u891a\u5f65\u752b}}) and Chu Yanchong ({{lang|zh|\u891a\u5f65\u6c96}}) were executed. Orders also were issued to execute Liu and Han, although Han died before the execution order reached his location. It was said that after this time, no official dared to criticize the emperor.\n\nIn 660, Li Zhong, Gaozong's first-born son (to consort Liu) also was targeted. Li Zhong had feared that he would be next and had sought out advice of fortune tellers. Wu had him exiled and placed under house arrest.<ref name=\"ZZTJ200\" />\n\n===As the real and influential power behind the Emperor===\n\nIn 660, Emperor Gaozong and Empress Wu toured Bian Prefecture (modern-day Taiyuan), and Empress Wu had the opportunity to invite her old neighbors and relatives to a feast.<ref name=\"ZZTJ200\" /> Later that year, Emperor Gaozong began to suffer from an illness that carried the symptoms of painful headaches and loss of vision, generally thought to be hypertension-related,<ref>See, ''Bo Yang Edition of the Zizhi Tongjian'', vol. 40, p 683.</ref> and he began to have Empress Wu make rulings on petitions made by officials. It was said that Empress Wu had quick reactions and understood both literature and history, and therefore, she was making correct rulings. Thereafter, her authority rivaled Emperor Gaozong's, after this point on, Empress Wu became the undisputed power behind the throne for twenty-three years.<ref name=\"ZZTJ200\" />\n\nBy 664, Empress Wu was said to be interfering so much in the imperial governance that she was angering Emperor Gaozong. Further, she had engaged the [[Taoist]] sorcerer Guo Xingzhen ({{lang|zh|\u90ed\u884c\u771f}}) in using witchcraft\u2014an act that was prohibited by regulations and which had led to Empress Wang's downfall\u2014and the [[Eunuch (court official)|eunuch]] Wang Fusheng ({{lang|zh|\u738b\u4f0f\u52dd}}) reported this to Emperor Gaozong, further angering him. He consulted the chancellor [[Shangguan Yi]], who suggested that he depose Empress Wu. He had Shangguan draft an edict, but as Shangguan was doing so Empress Wu received news of what was happening. She went to the emperor to plead her case, just as he was holding the edict that Shangguan had drafted. Emperor Gaozong could not bear to depose her, blaming the episode on Shangguan. As both Shangguan and Wang had served on Li Zhong's staff, Empress Wu had Xu falsely accuse Shangguan, Wang, and Li Zhong of planning treason. Shangguan, Wang, and Shangguan's son Shangguan Tingzhi ({{lang|zh|\u4e0a\u5b98\u5ead\u829d}}) were executed, while Li Zhong was forced to commit suicide.<ref name=\"ZZTJ201\">{{harvp|Zizhi Tongjian|1084|loc= [[:zh:s:\u8cc7\u6cbb\u901a\u9451/\u5377201|vol. 201]]}}</ref> (Shangguan Tingzhi's daughter [[Shangguan Wan'er]], then an infant, and her mother, Lady Zheng, became slaves in the inner palace. After Shangguan Wan'er grew up, she eventually became a trusted secretary for Empress Wu.) Thereafter, at imperial meetings for eighteen years, Empress Wu would sit behind a pearl screen behind Emperor  Gaozong, hear the reports as well, and imperial powers often fell into her hands, and she effectively was making the major decisions and even held court independently when the Emperor was unwell And in the absence of her husband, she gained vast powers and Empress Wu had the ultimate power, and she became a Controversial and formidable figure with far-reaching influence. She and Emperor Gaozong were thereafter referred to as the \"Two Saints.\" ({{lang|zh|\u4e8c\u8056}}, ''Er Sheng'').<ref name=\"ZZTJ201\" />\n\nMeanwhile, on Empress Wu's account, her mother Lady Yang had been created the Lady of Rong, and her older sister, now widowed, the Lady of Han. Her brothers Wu Yuanqing and Wu Yuanshuang and cousins Wu Weiliang and Wu Huaiyun, despite the poor relationships that they had with Lady Yang, were promoted. At a feast that Lady Yang held for them, however, Wu Weiliang offended Lady Yang by stating that they did not find it honorable for them to be promoted on account of Empress Wu. Empress Wu, therefore, requested to have them demoted to remote prefectures\u2014outwardly to show modesty, but in reality to avenge the offense to her mother. Wu Yuanqing and Wu Yuanshuang died in effective exile. Meanwhile, in or before 666, Lady of Han died as well, and after her death, Emperor Gaozong created her daughter the Lady of Wei and considered keeping her in the palace\u2014possibly as a concubine\u2014but did not immediately do so, as he feared that Empress Wu would be displeased. It was said that Empress Wu heard of this and was nevertheless displeased, and she had the Lady of Wei poisoned, by placing poison in food offerings that Wu Weiliang and Wu Huaiyun had made and then blaming Wu Weiliang and Wu Huaiyun for the murder. Wu Weiliang and Wu Huaiyun were executed.<ref name=\"ZZTJ201\" /><ref name=\"WuShihuo\">For Wu Shihuo's career and family, see generally ''[[Old Book of Tang]]'', [[:zh:s:\u820a\u5510\u66f8/\u537758|vol. 58]] and ''New Book of Tang'', [[:zh:s:\u65b0\u5510\u66f8/\u5377206|vol. 206]]</ref>\n\nIn 670, Wu's mother, Lady Yang, died and by Emperor Gaozong's orders, all of the imperial officials and their wives attended her wake and mourned her. Later that year, with the realm suffering from a major drought, Empress Wu offered to be deposed, an offer Emperor Gaozong rejected. He further posthumously honored Wu Shihuo (who had previously been posthumously honored as the Duke of Zhou) and Lady Yang by giving them the titles of the Prince and Princess of Taiyuan.<ref name=\"ZZTJ201\" />\n\nMeanwhile, the son of Wu's older sister, the Lady of Han, (Wu's nephew) Helan Minzhi ({{lang|zh|\u8cc0\u862d\u654f\u4e4b}}) had been given the surname of Wu and allowed to inherit the title of Duke of Zhou. As it was becoming clear, however, that he was suspecting Empress Wu of having murdered his sister, Empress Wu began to take precautions against him, he also was said to have had an incestuous relationship with his grandmother Lady Yang. In 671, Helan Minzhi was accused of having disobeyed mourning regulations during the period of mourning for Lady Yang, and also of raping the daughter of the official Yang Sijian ({{lang|zh|\u694a\u601d\u5109}}), whom Emperor Gaozong and Empress Wu had previously selected to be the wife and crown princess for Li Hong. Helan Minzhi was exiled and either was executed in exile or committed suicide. In 674, Empress Wu had Wu Yuanshuang's son [[Wu Chengsi]] recalled from exile to inherit the title of Duke of Zhou.<ref name=\"ZZTJ202\">{{harvp|Zizhi Tongjian|1084|loc= [[:zh:s:\u8cc7\u6cbb\u901a\u9451/\u5377202|vol. 202]]}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Luoyang 2006 7-29.jpg|thumb|The Fengxian cave (c. 675) of the [[Longmen Grottoes]], commissioned by Wu Zetian; the large, central Buddha is representative of the ''[[Vairocana]]'']]\n\nIn 675, with Emperor Gaozong's illness getting worse, he considered having Empress Wu formally rule as [[regent]]. The chancellor [[Hao Chujun]] and the official [[Li Yiyan]] both opposed this, and he did not formally make her regent, Although Wu, as empress, had rather in the absence of her husband relatively of the emperor more political power and was often ahead of the Emperor Gaozong.\n\nAlso in 675, a number of people would fall victim to Empress Wu's ire. Empress Wu had been displeased at the favor that Emperor Gaozong had shown his aunt, Princess Changle, who had married the general Zhao Gui ({{lang|zh|\u8d99\u74cc}}) and whose daughter had become the wife and princess of Wu's third son Li Xi\u01cen, the Prince of Zhou. Princess Zhao was therefore accused of unspecified crimes and put under arrest, eventually being starved to death. Zhao Gui and Princess Changle were exiled. Meanwhile, later that month, Li Hong, the Crown Prince\u2014who had been urging Empress Wu not to exercise so much influence on Emperor Gaozong's governance and who had offended Empress Wu by requesting that his half-sisters, Consort Xiao's daughters, Princess Yiyang and Xuancheng, who had been under house arrest, be allowed to marry\u2014died suddenly. Traditional historians generally believed that Empress Wu poisoned Li Hong to death. Li Xi\u00e1n, then carrying the title of Prince of Yong, was created crown prince.<ref name=\"ZZTJ202\" /> Meanwhile, Consort Xiao's son Li Sujie and another son of Emperor Gaozong's, [[Li Shangjin]] ({{lang|zh|\u674e\u4e0a\u91d1}}), were repeatedly accused of crimes by Empress Wu and were demoted.<ref name=\"ZZTJ202\" />\n\nSoon Empress Wu's relationship with Li Xi\u00e1n also deteriorated, as Li Xi\u00e1n had become unsettled after hearing rumors that he was not born to Empress Wu\u2014but to her sister, the Lady of Han\u2014and when Empress Wu heard of his fearfulness, she became angry with him. Further, the sorcerer Ming Chongyan ({{lang|zh|\u660e\u5d07\u513c}}), whom both she and Emperor Gaozong respected and who had stated that Li Xi\u00e1n was unsuitable to inherit the throne, was assassinated in 679. The assassins were not caught\u2014causing Wu to suspect that Li Xi\u00e1n was behind the assassination. In 680, Li Xi\u00e1n was accused of crimes and during an investigation by the officials [[Xue Yuanchao]], [[Pei Yan]], and [[Gao Zhizhou]], a large number of arms were found in Li Xi\u00e1n's palace. Empress Wu formally accused Li Xi\u00e1n of treason and the assassination of Ming. Li Xi\u00e1n was deposed and exiled.\n\nAfter, the exile of Li Xi\u00e1n, his younger brother Li Xi\u01cen [similar-sounding name but different Chinese characters] (who had by now been renamed Li Zhe) was created crown prince.<ref name=\"ZZTJ202\" />\n\nIn 681, Princess Taiping was married to Xue Shao ({{lang|zh|\u859b\u7d39}}), the son of Emperor Gaozong's sister Princess Chengyang, in a grand ceremony. Empress Wu, initially unimpressed with the lineages of Xue Shao's brothers' wives, wanted to order his brothers to divorce their wives\u2014stopping only after it was pointed out to her that Lady Xiao, the wife of Xue Shao's older brother Xue Yi ({{lang|zh|\u859b\u9857}}), was a grandniece of the deceased chancellor [[Xiao Yu]].<ref name=\"ZZTJ202\" />\n\nIn late 683, Emperor Gaozong died while at Luoyang.

Wu already had poisoned the crown prince Li Hong and had enough other princes exiled that her third son, [[Emperor Zhongzong of Tang|Li Zhe]], had been made heir apparent. Furthermore, Gaozong's will included provisions that Li Zhe should ascend immediately to the imperial throne, and that he should look to Empress Wu in regard to any important matter, either military or civil.<ref name=\"Paludan, 97\">{{harvp|Paludan|1998|p= 97}}</ref> In the second month of 684, Li Zhe ascended to the imperial throne, taking the regnal name of Zhongzong, for the short six weeks of his reign.\n\nImmediately, Emperor Zhongzong showed signs of disobeying Empress Dowager Wu. Emperor Zhongzong was under the thumb of his wife, the empress Wei, even appointing his father-in-law prime minister. He also tried to make his father-in-law ''Shizhong'' ({{lang|zh|\u4f8d\u4e2d}}, the head of the examination bureau of government, {{lang|zh|\u9580\u4e0b\u7701}}, ''Menxia Sheng'', and a post considered one for a chancellor) and giving a mid-level office to his [[wet nurse]]'s son\u2014despite stern opposition by the chancellor Pei Yan, at one point remarking to Pei:<ref name=\"ZZTJ203\" />\n\n{{quote|What would be wrong even if I gave the empire to Wei Xuanzhen? Why do you care about ''Shizhong'' so much?}}\n\nPei reported this to Empress Dowager Wu, and she, after planning with Pei, Liu Yizhi, and the generals Cheng Wuting ({{lang|zh|\u7a0b\u52d9\u633a}}) and Zhang Qianxu ({{lang|zh|\u5f35\u8654\u52d6}}), deposed him and replaced him with her youngest son Li Dan, the Prince of Yu (as Emperor Ruizong). Wu Zetian had Zhongzong's father in law, Wei Xuanzhen ({{lang|zh|\u97cb\u7384\u8c9e}}), brought up on charges of treason, and he was sent into seclusion. Emperor Zhongzong was reduced to the title of Prince of Luling and exiled. Empress Dowager Wu also sent the general Qiu Shenji ({{lang|zh|\u4e18\u795e\u52e3}}) to Li Xi\u00e1n's place in exile and forced Li Xi\u00e1n to commit suicide.\n\n===As regent for Emperor Ruizong===\nWu had her youngest son [[Emperor Ruizong of Tang|Li Dan]] made emperor, as Emperor Ruizong. She was the ruler, however, both in substance and appearance. Wu did not even follow the customary pretense of hiding behind a screen or curtain and, in whispers, issued commands for the nominal ruler to formally announce. Ruizong never moved into the imperial quarters, appeared at no imperial function, and remained a virtual prisoner in the inner quarters.<ref>{{harvp|Paludan|1998|pp= 97\u2013101}}</ref>\n\nAlthough Emperor Ruizong held the title of emperor, Empress Dowager Wu firmly controlled the imperial court, and the officials were not allowed to meet with Emperor Ruizong, nor was he allowed to rule on matters of state. Rather, the matters of state were ruled on by Empress Dowager Wu. At the suggestion of her nephew Wu Chengsi, she also expanded the ancestral shrine of the Wu ancestors and gave them greater posthumous honours.<ref name=\"ZZTJ203\" />\n\nIn 686, Empress Dowager Wu offered to return imperial authorities to Emperor Ruizong, but Emperor Ruizong, knowing that she did not truly intend to do so, declined, and she continued to exercise imperial authority.\n\nSoon thereafter, Li Ji's grandson [[Li Jingye]], the Duke of Ying, who had been disaffected by his own exile, started a rebellion at Yang Prefecture ({{lang|zh|\u63da\u5dde}}, roughly modern [[Yangzhou]], [[Jiangsu]]). The rebellion initially drew much popular support in the region, however, Li Jingye progressed slowly in his attack and did not take advantage of that popular support. Meanwhile, Pei suggested to Empress Dowager Wu that she return imperial authority to the Emperor and argued that doing so would cause the rebellion to collapse on its own. This offended her, and she accused him of being complicit with Li Jingye and had him executed; she also demoted, exiled, and killed a number of officials who, when Pei was arrested, tried to speak on his behalf. She sent a general, Li Xiaoyi ({{lang|zh|\u674e\u5b5d\u9038}}), to attack Li Jingye, and while Li Xiaoyi was initially unsuccessful, he pushed on at the urging of his assistant [[Wei Yuanzhong]] and eventually was able to crush Li Jingye's forces. Li Jingye fled and was killed in flight.<ref name=\"ZZTJ203\" />\n\nBy 685, Empress Dowager Wu began to carry on an affair with the [[Buddhist monk]] [[Xue Huaiyi|Huaiyi]] and during the next few years, Huaiyi would be bestowed with progressively greater honours.<ref name=\"ZZTJ203\" /><ref name=\"ZZTJ204\">{{harvp|Zizhi Tongjian|1084|loc= [[:zh:s:\u8cc7\u6cbb\u901a\u9451/\u5377204|vol. 204]]}}</ref><ref name=\"ZZTJ205\">{{harvp|Zizhi Tongjian|1084|loc= [[:zh:s:\u8cc7\u6cbb\u901a\u9451/\u5377205|vol. 205]]}}</ref>\n\nMeanwhile, she installed copper mailboxes outside the imperial government buildings to encourage the people of the realm to report secretly on others, as she suspected many officials of opposing her. Exploiting these beliefs of hers, secret police officials, including [[Suo Yuanli]], [[Zhou Xing (Tang dynasty)|Zhou Xing]], and [[Lai Junchen]], began to rise in power and to carry out systematic false accusations, tortures, and executions of individuals.<ref name=\"ZZTJ203\" />\n\nIn 688, Empress Dowager Wu was set to make sacrifices to the deity of the [[Luo River (Henan)|Luo River]] ({{lang|zh|\u6d1b\u6c34}}, flowing through the Henan province city of [[Luoyang]], then the \"Eastern Capital\"). Wu summoned senior members of Tang's Li imperial clan to Luoyang. The imperial princes worried that she planned to slaughter them and secure the throne for herself: thus, they plotted to resist her. Before a rebellion could be comprehensively planned out, however, Li Zhen and his son [[Li Chong (Tang dynasty)|Li Chong]], the Prince of Langye rose first, at their respective posts as prefects of Yu Prefecture ({{lang|zh|\u8c6b\u5dde}}, roughly modern [[Zhumadian]], [[Henan]]) and Bo Prefecture ({{lang|zh|\u535a\u5dde}}, roughly modern [[Liaocheng]], [[Shandong]]). The other princes were not yet ready, however, and did not rise, and forces sent by Empress Dowager Wu and the local forces crushed Li Chong and Li Zhen's forces quickly. Empress Dowager Wu took this opportunity to arrest Emperor Gaozong's granduncles Li Yuanjia ({{lang|zh|\u674e\u5143\u5609}}) the Prince of Han, Li Lingkui ({{lang|zh|\u674e\u9748\u5914}}) the Prince of Lu, and Princess Changle, as well as many other members of the Li clan and she, forced them to commit suicide. Even Princess Taiping's husband Xue Shao was implicated and starved to death. In the subsequent years, there continued to be many politically motivated massacres of officials and Li clan members.<ref name=\"ZZTJ204\" />\n\nIn 690, Wu took the final step to become the [[empress regnant]] of the newly proclaimed [[Second Zhou dynasty|Zhou dynasty]], and the title ''Huangdi''. Traditional Chinese [[order of succession]] (akin to the [[Salic law]] in Europe) did not allow a woman to ascend the throne, but Wu Zetian was determined to quash the opposition and the use of the secret police did not subside, but continued, after her taking the throne. While her organization of the civil service system was criticized for its laxity of the promotion of officials, nonetheless, Wu Zetian was considered capable of evaluating the performance of the officials once they were in office. The [[Song dynasty]] historian [[Sima Guang]], in his ''[[Zizhi Tongjian]]'', commented:<ref name=\"ZZTJ205\" />\n{{quote|Even though the Empress Dowager{{NoteTag|Throughout the ''Zizhi Tongjian'' descriptions of Wu Zetian's reign, Sima referred to her as \"the Empress Dowager\", implicitly refusing to recognize her as empress regnant, although he used her [[Chinese era name|era name]]s.}} excessively used official titles to cause people to submit to her, if she saw that someone was incompetent, she would immediately depose or even execute him. She grasped the powers of punishment and award, controlled the state, and made her own judgments as to policy decisions. She was observant and had good judgment, so the talented people of the time also were willing to be used by her.}}\n\n==Reign as Empress regnant ==\nIn 690, Wu had Emperor Ruizong yield the throne to her and established the Zhou dynasty, with herself as the ruler (''Huangdi'').\n\nThe early part of her reign was characterized by secret police terror, which moderated as the years went by. She was, on the other hand, recognized as a capable and attentive ruler even by traditional historians who despised her, and her ability at selecting capable men to serve as officials was admired throughout the rest of the Tang dynasty as well as in subsequent dynasties.{{NoteTag|See, e.g., {{harvp|Zizhi Tongjian|1084|loc= [[:zh:s:\u8cc7\u6cbb\u901a\u9451/\u5377234|vol. 234]]}} &#91;submission of [[Lu Zhi (Tang dynasty)|Lu Zhi]] to [[Emperor Dezong of Tang]], citing Wu Zetian as the prime example of a capable selector of officials&#93;; [[Zhao Yi]]'s ''[[Notes of the Twenty-Two Histories]]'' ({{lang|zh|\u4e8c\u5341\u4e8c\u53f2\u5284\u8a18}}), ''Empress Wu Accepted Corrections and Knew People''. http://ctwang.myweb.hinet.net/22szj/300/0260.htm.}} (She would be overthrown in a coup in 705 and Emperor Zhongzong returned to the throne, but she would continue to carry the title of \"emperor\" until her death later in that year).\n\n=== Early reign (690-696) ===\n[[File:Epitaph for Yang Shun, general to Empress Wu Zetian, China, Luoyang, Tang dynasty, 693 AD, limestone - Royal Ontario Museum - DSC03576.JPG|thumb|[[Epitaph]] for [[Yang Shun]], general to Empress Wu Zetian, China, [[Luoyang]], 693, limestone, [[Royal Ontario Museum]]]]\n\nShortly after Wu Zetian took the throne, she elevated the status of Buddhism above that of [[Taoism]], officially sanctioning Buddhism by building temples named Dayun Temple ({{lang|zh|\u5927\u96f2\u5bfa}}) in each prefecture belonging to the capital regions of the two capitals Luoyang and Chang'an, and created nine senior monks as dukes. She also enshrined seven generations of Wu ancestors at the imperial ancestral temple, although she also continued to offer sacrifices to the Tang emperors Gaozu, Taizong, and Gaozong.<ref name=\"ZZTJ204\" />\n\nShe faced the issue of succession. At the time she took the throne, she created Li Dan, the former Emperor Ruizong, crown prince, and bestowed the name of Wu on him.<ref name=\"ZZTJ204\" /> The official [[Zhang Jiafu]], however, convinced the commoner Wang Qingzhi ({{lang|zh|\u738b\u6176\u4e4b}}) to start a petition drive to make her nephew Wu Chengsi crown prince, arguing that an emperor named Wu should pass the throne to a member of the Wu clan. Wu Zetian was tempted to do so, and when the chancellors [[Cen Changqian]] and [[Ge Fuyuan]] opposed sternly, they, along with fellow chancellor [[Ouyang Tong]], were executed. Nevertheless, she declined Wang's request to make Wu Chengsi crown prince, but for a time allowed Wang to freely enter the palace to see her. On one occasion, however, when Wang angered her by coming to the palace too much, she asked the official [[Li Zhaode]] to batter Wang as punishment\u2014but Li Zhaode exploited the opportunity to batter Wang to death, and his group of petitioners scattered. Li Zhaode then persuaded Wu Zetian to keep Li Dan as crown prince\u2014pointing out that a son was closer in relations than a nephew, and also that if Wu Chengsi became emperor, Emperor Gaozong would never again be worshiped. Wu Zetian agreed, and for some time did not reconsider the matter.<ref name=\"ZZTJ204\" /> Further, at Li Zhaode's warning that Wu Chengsi was becoming too powerful, Wu Zetian stripped Wu Chengsi of his chancellor authority and bestowed on him largely honorific titles without authority.<ref name=\"ZZTJ205\" />\n\nMeanwhile, the power of the secret police officials continued to increase, until they appeared to be curbed starting in about 692, when Lai Junchen was foiled in his attempt to have the chancellors [[Ren Zhigu]], [[Di Renjie]], [[Pei Xingben]], and other officials Cui Xuanli ({{lang|zh|\u5d14\u5ba3\u79ae}}), Lu Xian ({{lang|zh|\u76e7\u737b}}), Wei Yuanzhong, and Li Sizhen ({{lang|zh|\u674e\u55e3\u771e}}) executed, as Di, under arrest, had hidden a secret petition inside a change of clothes and had it submitted by his son Di Guangyuan ({{lang|zh|\u72c4\u5149\u9060}}). The seven still were exiled, but after this incident, particularly at the urging of Li Zhaode, [[Zhu Jingze]], and Zhou Ju ({{lang|zh|\u5468\u77e9}}), the waves of politically motivated massacres decreased, although they did not end entirely.<ref name=\"ZZTJ205\" />\n\nAlso in 692, Wu Zetian commissioned the general [[Wang Xiaojie]] to attack the [[Tibetan Empire]], and Wang recaptured the four garrisons of the [[Western Regions]] that had fallen to the Tibetan Empire in 670 \u2013 [[Kucha]], [[Yutian County, Xinjiang|Yutian]], [[Kashgar]], and [[Suyab]].<ref name=\"ZZTJ205\" />\n\nIn 693, after Wu Zetian's trusted [[lady-in-waiting]] Wei Tuan'er ({{lang|zh|\u97cb\u5718\u5152}}), who hated Li Dan (the reason why she did so is lost to history), falsely accused Li Dan's wife [[Empress Liu (Tang dynasty)|Crown Princess Liu]] and Consort Dou of using witchcraft, Wu Zetian had Crown Princess Liu and Consort Dou killed. Li Dan, fearful that he was to be next, did not dare to speak of them. When Wei further planned to falsely accuse Li Dan, however, someone else informed on her, and she was executed. Wu Zetian nevertheless had Li Dan's sons demoted in their princely titles, and when the officials Pei Feigong ({{lang|zh|\u88f4\u532a\u8eac}}) and Fan Yunxian ({{lang|zh|\u8303\u96f2\u4ed9}}) were accused of secretly meeting Li Dan, she executed Pei and Fan and further, barred officials from meeting Li Dan. There were then accusations that Li Dan was plotting treason, and under Wu Zetian's direction, Lai launched an investigation. Lai arrested Li Dan's servants and tortured them\u2014and the torture was such that many of them were ready to falsely implicate themselves and Li Dan. One of Li Dan's servants, [[An Jincang]], however, proclaimed Li Dan's innocence and cut his own belly open to swear to that fact. When Wu Zetian heard of what An did, she had doctors attend to An and barely save his life, and then ordered Lai to end the investigation, thus saving Li Dan.<ref name=\"ZZTJ205\" />\n\nIn 694, Li Zhaode, who had become powerful after Wu Chengsi's removal, was thought to be too powerful and Wu Zetian removed him.<ref name=\"ZZTJ205\" /> Also around this time, she became highly impressed with a group of mystic individuals\u2014the hermit [[Wei Shifang]] (on whom she bestowed a chancellor title briefly), who claimed to be more than 350&nbsp;years old; an old [[bhikkhuni|Buddhist nun]] who claimed to be a [[buddhahood|Buddha]] and capable of predicting the future; and a non-[[Han Chinese|Han]] man who claimed to be 500&nbsp;years old.

In spring 696, an army she sent, commanded by Wang Xiaojie and [[Lou Shide]] against the Tibetan Empire, was soundly defeated by Tibetan generals, the brothers [[Gar Trinring Tsendro]] ({{lang|zh|\u8ad6\u6b3d\u9675 }}) and [[Gar Tsenba]] ({{lang|zh| \u8ad6\u8d0a\u5a46 }}), and as a result, she demoted Wang to commoner rank and Lou to be a low level prefectural official, although she eventually restored both of them to general positions.<ref name=\"ZZTJ205\" /> In April of the same year, Wu Zetian recast the [[Nine Tripod Cauldrons]], the symbol of ultimate power in ancient China, to reinforce her authority.<ref name=\"ZZTJ208\" />\n\nA much more serious threat arose in summer 696. The [[Khitan people|Khitan]] chieftains [[Li Jinzhong]] and [[Sun Wanrong]], brothers-in-law, angry over the mistreatment of the Khitan people by the Zhou official Zhao Wenhui ({{lang|zh|\u8d99\u6587\u7ffd}}), the prefect of Ying Prefecture ({{lang|zh|\u71df\u5dde }}, roughly [[Zhaoyang County]], [[Liaoning]]), rebelled, with Li assuming the title of Wushang Khan (\u7121\u4e0a\u53ef\u6c57). Armies that Wu Zetian sent to suppress Li and Sun's rebellion were defeated by Khitan forces, which in turn attacked Zhou proper. Meanwhile, [[Qapaghan Qaghan]] of the [[Second Turkic Khaganate]] offered to submit, and yet was also launching attacks against Zhou and Khitan\u2014including an attack against Khitan base of operations during the winter of 696, shortly after Li's death, that captured Li's and Sun's families and temporarily halted Khitan operations against Zhou.<ref name=\"ZZTJ205\" /> Sun, after taking over as khan and reorganizing Khitan forces, again attacked Zhou territory and had many victories over Zhou forces, including a battle during which Wang Shijie was killed.<ref name=\"ZZTJ206\">{{harvp|Zizhi Tongjian|1084|loc= [[:zh:s:\u8cc7\u6cbb\u901a\u9451/\u5377206|vol. 206]]}}</ref><ref name=\"ZZTJ205\" /> Wu Zetian tried to allay the situation by making peace with Ashina Mochuo at fairly costly terms\u2014the return of Tujue people who had previously submitted to Zhou and providing Ashina Mochuo with seeds, silk, tools, and iron. In summer 697, Ashina Mochuo launched another attack on Khitan's base of operations, and this time, after his attack, Khitan forces collapsed and Sun was killed in flight, ending the Khitan threat.<ref name=\"ZZTJ206\" />\n\nMeanwhile, also in 697, Lai Junchen, who had at one point lost power but then had returned to power, falsely accused Li Zhaode (who had been pardoned) of crimes, and then planned to falsely accuse Li Dan, Li Zhe, the Wu clan princes, and Princess Taiping, of treason. The Wu clan princes and Princess Taiping acted first against him, accusing him of crimes, and he and Li Zhaode were executed together. After Lai's death, the reign of the secret police largely ended. Gradually, many of the victims of Lai and the other secret police officials were exonerated posthumously.<ref name=\"ZZTJ206\" /> Meanwhile, around this time, Wu Zetian began relationships with two new lovers\u2014the brothers [[Zhang Yizhi and Zhang Changzong]], who became honored within the palace and were eventually created dukes.<ref name=\"ZZTJ206\" /><ref name=\"ZZTJ207\">{{harvp|Zizhi Tongjian|1084|loc= [[:zh:s:\u8cc7\u6cbb\u901a\u9451/\u5377207|vol. 207]]}}</ref>\n\nAround 698, Wu Chengsi and another nephew of Wu Zetian's, [[Wu Sansi]], the Prince of Liang, were repeatedly making attempts to have officials persuade Wu Zetian to create one of them crown prince\u2014again citing the reason that an emperor should pass the throne to someone of the same clan. Di Renjie, who by now had become a trusted chancellor, was firmly against the idea, however, and proposed that Li Zhe be recalled instead. He was supported in this by fellow chancellors [[Wang Fangqing]] and [[Wang Jishan]], as well as Wu Zetian's close advisor [[Ji Xu]], who further persuaded the Zhang brothers to support the idea as well. In spring 698, Wu Zetian agreed and recalled Li Zhe from exile. Soon, Li Dan offered to yield the crown prince position to Li Zhe, and Wu Zetian created Li Zhe crown prince. She soon changed his name back to Li Xi\u01cen and then Wu Xian.<ref name=\"ZZTJ206\" />\n\nLater, Ashina Mochuo demanded a [[Tang dynasty]] prince for marriage to his daughter, part of a plot to join his family with the Tang, displace the Zhou, and restore Tang rule over China (under his influence). When Wu Zetian sent a member of her own family, grandnephew Wu Yanxiu ({{lang|zh|\u6b66\u5ef6\u79c0}}), to marry Mochuo's daughter instead, he rejected him.<ref>{{Cite book\n |title = A history of China\n |author = Jonathan Wolfram Eberhard\n |year = 1997\n |publisher = University of California Press\n |page = 186\n |url = https://books.google.com/books?id=mUofeN6WW_IC&pg=PA186&dq=kao+tsung+demanded+chinese+prince+daughter&hl=en&ei=LWhMTOTUDoL58AaKzeU2&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=1&ved=0CCsQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&q=kao%20tsung%20demanded%20chinese%20prince%20daughter&f=false\n |access-date = 2010-06-28\n |ISBN = 978-0-520-03268-2\n}}</ref> Ashina Mochuo had no intention to cement the peace treaty with a marriage; instead, when Wu Yanxiu arrived, he detained Wu Yanxiu and then launched a major attack on Zhou, advancing as far south as Zhao Prefecture ({{lang|zh|\u8d99\u5dde}}, in modern [[Shijiazhuang]], [[Hebei]]) before withdrawing.<ref name=\"ZZTJ206\" />\n\nIn 699, however, at least the Tibetan threat would cease. Emperor [[Tridu Songtsen]], unhappy that Gar Trinring was monopolizing power, took an opportunity when Trinring was away from the capital [[Lhasa]] to slaughter Trinring's associates. He then defeated Trinring in battle, and Trinring committed suicide. Gar Tsenba and Trinring's son, [[Lun Gongren]] ({{lang|zh|\u8ad6\u5f13\u4ec1}}), surrendered to Zhou. After this, the Tibetan Empire was under internal turmoil for several years, and there was peace for Zhou on the border.<ref name=\"ZZTJ206\" />\n\nAlso in 699, Wu Zetian, realizing that she was growing old, feared that after her death, Li Xian and the Wu clan princes would not be able to have peace with each other, and she made him, Li Dan, Princess Taiping, Princess Taiping's second husband [[Wu Youji]] (a nephew of hers), the Prince of Ding, and other Wu clan princes to swear an oath to each other.<ref name=\"ZZTJ206\" />\n\n=== Late reign (701-705) ===\n[[File:Tang Dynasty circa 700 CE.png|thumb|Estimated territorial extent of Wu Zetian's empire]]\n\nAs Wu Zetian grew older, Zhang Yizhi and Zhang Changzong became increasingly powerful, and even the princes of the Wu clan flattered them. She also increasingly relied on them to handle the affairs of state. This was secretly discussed and criticized by her grandson [[Li Chongrun]], the Prince of Shao, (Li Xian's son), granddaughter [[Li Xianhui]] ({{lang|zh|\u674e\u4ed9\u8559}}) the Lady Yongtai (Li Chongrun's sister), and Li Xianhui's husband Wu Yanji ({{lang|zh|\u6b66\u5ef6\u57fa}}) the Prince of Wei (Wu Zetian's grandnephew and Wu Chengsi's son), but somehow the discussion was leaked, and Zhang Yizhi reported this to Wu Zetian. She ordered the three of them to commit suicide.{{NoteTag|The ''Zizhi Tongjian'' asserted that Li Chongrun was forced to commit suicide, but the ''[[Old Book of Tang]]'' and the ''[[New Book of Tang]]'' asserted in his biographies that he was caned to death on Wu Zetian's orders.

Individuals she promoted in her old age included, among others, [[Cui Xuanwei]] and [[Zhang Jiazhen]].<ref name=\"ZZTJ207\" />\n\nBy 703, Zhang Yizhi and Zhang Changzong had become resentful of Wei Yuanzhong, who by now was a senior chancellor, for dressing down their brother Zhang Changyi ({{lang|zh|\u5f35\u660c\u5100}}) and rejecting the promotion of another brother Zhang Changqi ({{lang|zh|\u5f35\u660c\u671f}}). They also were fearful that if Wu Zetian died, Wei would find a way to execute them, and therefore accused Wei and Gao Jian ({{lang|zh|\u9ad8\u6229}}), an official favoured by Princess Taiping, of speculating on Wu Zetian's old age and death. They initially got Wei's subordinate [[Zhang Yue (Tang dynasty)|Zhang Shuo]] to agree to corroborate the charges, but once Zhang Shuo was before Wu Zetian, he instead accused Zhang Yizhi and Zhang Changzong of forcing him to bear false witness. As a result, Wei, Gao, and Zhang Shuo were exiled, but escaped death.<ref name=\"ZZTJ207\" />\n\n== Removal and death ==\n[[File:Qianling.jpg|thumb|upright|Located to the east of Phoenix Gate within the [[Qianling Mausoleum]]\u2013built near [[Chang'an]] in 706 to house the remains of [[Tang Gaozong]], Empress Wu, and other royal members of the Chinese [[Tang Dynasty]]\u2013is the large Blank Tablet or Wordless Stele. This tablet is 6.3 meters tall and weighs 98 tonnes. Although no written inscriptions adorn this edifice (hence its name), the sides of the tablet feature carved dragons while the top features carved oysters.]]\n\nIn autumn of 704, there began to be accusations of corruption levied against Zhang Yizhi and Zhang Changzong, as well as their brothers Zhang Changqi, Zhang Changyi, and Zhang Tongxiu ({{lang|zh|\u5f35\u540c\u4f11}}). Zhang Tongxiu and Zhang Changyi were demoted, but even though the officials Li Chengjia ({{lang|zh|\u674e\u627f\u5609}}) and [[Huan Yanfan]] advocated that Zhang Yizhi and Zhang Changzong be removed as well, Wu Zetian, taking the suggestion of the chancellor [[Yang Zaisi]], did not remove them. Subsequently, charges of corruption against Zhang Yizhi and Zhang Changzong were renewed by the chancellor [[Wei Anshi]].<ref name=\"ZZTJ207\" />\n[[File:Qianling Mausoleum 38 2013-08.JPG|thumb|left|upright|Side view of the Blank Tablet.]]\n\nIn winter 704, Wu Zetian became seriously ill for a period, and only the Zhang brothers were allowed to see her; the chancellors were not. This led to speculation that Zhang Yizhi and Zhang Changzong were plotting to take over the throne, and there were repeated accusations of treason. Once her condition improved, Cui Xuanwei advocated that only Li Xian and Li Dan be allowed to attend to her\u2014a suggestion that she did not accept. After further accusations against the Zhang brothers by Huan and [[Song Jing]], Wu Zetian allowed Song to investigate, but before the investigation was completed, she issued a pardon for Zhang Yizhi, derailing Song's investigation.<ref name=\"ZZTJ207\" />\n\nBy spring 705, Wu Zetian was seriously ill again. [[Zhang Jianzhi]], [[Jing Hui]], and [[Yuan Shuji]], planned a coup to kill the Zhang brothers. They convinced the generals [[Li Duozuo]], Li Dan ({{lang|zh|\u674e\u6e5b}}, note different character than the [[Emperor Ruizong of Tang|former emperor]]), and Yang Yuanyan ({{lang|zh|\u694a\u5143\u7430}}) and another chancellor, [[Yao Chong|Yao Yuanzhi]], to be involved. With agreement from Li Xian as well, they acted on 20 February,{{cn |date=September 2019}} killing [[Zhang Yizhi]] and [[Zhang Changzong]], and then they had Changsheng Hall ({{lang|zh|\u9577\u751f\u6bbf}}), where Wu Zetian was residing, surrounded. They then reported to her that the Zhang brothers had been executed for treason, and they then forced her to yield the throne to Li Xian. On 21 February, an edict was issued in her name that made Li Xian regent, and on 22 February, an edict was issued in her name passing the throne to Li Xian. On 23 February, Li Xian formally retook the throne, and the next day, Wu Zetian, under heavy guard, was moved to the subsidiary palace, Shangyang Palace ({{lang|zh|\u4e0a\u967d\u5bae}}), but was nevertheless honoured with the title of Empress Regnant Zetian Dasheng ({{lang|zh|\u5247\u5929\u5927\u8056\u7687\u5e1d}}).<ref name=\"ZZTJ207\" /> On 3 March,{{cn |date=September 2019}} Tang dynasty was restored, ending the Zhou.<ref name=\"ZZTJ208\">{{harvp|Zizhi Tongjian|1084|loc= [[:zh:s:\u8cc7\u6cbb\u901a\u9451/\u5377208|vol. 208]]}}.</ref>\n\nShe died on 16 December,{{cn |date=September 2019}} and, pursuant to a final edict issued in her name, was no longer referred to as empress regnant, but instead as Empress Consort Zetian Dasheng ({{lang|zh|\u5247\u5929\u5927\u8056\u7687\u540e}}).<ref name=\"ZZTJ208\" /> In 706, Wu Zetian's son [[Emperor Zhongzong of Tang|Emperor Zhongzong]] had Wu Zetian interred in a joint burial with his father [[Emperor Gaozong of Tang|Emperor Gaozong]] at the [[Qianling Mausoleum]], located near the capital [[Chang'an]] on Mount Liang. Emperor Zhongzong also buried at Qianling his brother [[Li Xian (prince)|Li Xi\u00e1n]], son [[Li Chongrun]], and daughter Li Xianhui ({{lang|zh|\u674e\u4ed9\u8559}}) the Lady Yongtai (posthumously honoured as the Princess Yongtai)\u2014victims of Wu Zetian's wrath.\n\n== Zhou dynasty ==\n{{main|Zhou dynasty (690\u2013705)}}\n\nWu Zetian proclaimed herself as the ruler of the \"[[Zhou dynasty (690\u2013705)|Zhou dynasty]]\", named after the historical [[Zhou dynasty]] (1046\u2013256 BC); and, thus, from 690 to 705 the Chinese Empire was known as the Zhou dynasty. The traditional historical view, however, is to discount Wu's \"Zhou dynasty\": dynasties by definition involve the succession of rulers from one family: Wu's \"Zhou dynasty\" was founded by her, and ended within her lifetime, with her abdication (705). This does not meet the traditional concept of a dynasty. The alternative, is to view Wu's \"Zhou dynasty\" as the revival of the generally historically-accepted historical Zhou dynasty, which had been ruled (at least nominally) by the [[Ji (surname)|Ji]] family, almost a thousand years before. Either way, Wu's Zhou dynasty is best viewed as a brief interruption of the Li family's Tang dynasty, rather than as a fully realized dynasty. Her claim of founding a new dynasty, however, was little opposed at the time (690).<ref>{{harvp|Paludan|1998|p= 101}}</ref> The fifteen-year period which Wu Zetian designated as her \"Zhou Dynasty\" considered in the context of nearly a half century of ''de facto'' rule (c. 654\u2013705) reveals a remarkable and still debated period of history.<ref>{{harvp|Fairbank|1992|pp= 81\u201382}}</ref> In this context, designating a new dynasty, with her as its emperor can be seen as part of her power politics, and as the culmination of her period of ruling. Though the fifteen years of Wu Zetian's Zhou dynasty had its own notable characteristics, these are difficult to separate from Wu's reign of power, which lasted for about half of a century.\n\nWu Zetian's consolidation of power in part relied on a system of spies. She used informants to choose persons to eliminate, a process which peaked in 697, with the wholesale demotion, exile, or killing of various aristocratic families and scholars, furthermore prohibiting their sons from holding office.<ref name=\"Paludan, 99\">{{harvp|Paludan|1998|p= 99}}</ref>\n\nOne apparatus of government which fell into Wu's power was the [[imperial examination]] system: the basic theory and practice of which was to recruit into government service those men who were the best educated, talented, and having the best potential to perform their duties, and to do so by testing a pool of candidates in order to determine this objectively. This pool was male only, and the qualified pool of candidates and resulting placements into official positions was on a relatively small scale at the time of Wu's assuming control of government. The official tests examined such things considered important for functionaries of the highly developed, bureaucratic government structure of the current imperial government. The qualities sought in a candidate for government service included determining the potential official's level of literacy in terms of reading and writing as well as his possession of the specific knowledge considered necessary and desirable for a governmental official, such as [[Confucianism|Confucian]] precepts on the nature of virtue and theory on the proper ordering of and relationships within society. Wu Zetian continued to use the imperial examination system to recruit civil servants, and she introduced major changes in regard to the system that she inherited, including increasing the pool of candidates permitted to take the test, by allowing commoners and gentry, who were previously disqualified by their background, to take them. Another thing she did was to expand the governmental examination system and to greatly increase the importance of this method of recruiting government officials, which she did in 693.<ref name=\"Paludan, 97\" /> Wu provided increased opportunity for the representation within government to people of the [[North China Plain]], versus people of the northwestern aristocratic families, (whom she decimated, anyway); and, the successful candidates who were recruited through the examination system became an elite group within her government.<ref name=\"Fairbank, 82\">{{harvp|Fairbank|1992|p= 82}}</ref> The historical details surrounding and the consequences of Wu Zetian's promoting a new group of people from previously disenfranchised backgrounds into prominence as powerful governmental officials as well as the role of the examination system in this regard, remains a matter of debate for scholars of this subject.\n\nWu Zetian eliminated many of her real, potential, or perceived rivals to power by means of death (including execution, suicide by command, and more-or-less directly killing people), demotion, and exile. Mostly this was carried out by her secret police, led by individuals like Wao Ganjun and [[Lai Junchen]]\u2014who were known to have written a document called the ''Manual of Accusation'', which detailed steps for interrogation and obtaining confessions by torture. One of these methods, the \"Dying Swine's Melancholy\" ({{lang|zh|\u6b7b\u732a\u6101}}),<ref>http://baike.baidu.com/view/159862.htm</ref>{{better source|date=August 2017}} which merely indicated a level of pain inflicted by a torture device, seems to have been conflated in the years following Wu's death with the story of the \"human swine\" torture conducted by [[Empress L\u00fc Zhi]], in which the victim had limbs and tongue amputated, was force-fed, and left to wallow in his own excrement.\n\nWu targeted various individuals, including many in her own family and her extended family. In reaction to an attempt to remove her from power, in 684, she massacred twelve entire collateral branches of the imperial family.<ref name=\"Paludan, 99\" /> Besides this, she also altered the ancient balance of power in China, dating back to the [[Qin dynasty]]. The old area of the [[Qin (state)|Qin state]] was later referred to as [[Guanzhong]], literally, the area \"within the fortified mountain passes\". It was from this area of northwest China that the Ying family of Qin arose to conquer, unifying China into its first historical empire. During the [[Han dynasty]], [[Sima Qian]] records in his ''[[Records of the Grand Historian|Shiji]]'' that Guanzhong had three-tenths of China's population, but six-tenths of its wealth.<ref>{{harvp|Cotterell|Cotterell|1975|p= 90}}</ref> Additionally, at the beginning of Wu Zetian's period of ascendency, Guanzhong was still the stronghold of the most nationally powerful aristocratic families, despite the fact that economic development in other parts of China had improved the lot of families in other regions. The Guangzhong aristocracy was not willing to relinquish their hold on the reins of government, however; while, at the same time, some of the more newly wealthy families in other areas, such as the [[North China Plain]] or [[Hubei]] were eager for a larger share of national power of their own. Most of the opposition to Wu was from the Guangzhong families of northwest China. Accordingly, she repressed them, instead favoring less privileged families, thus raising to the ranks of power many talented, but less aristocratic families, often recruited through the official examination system.<ref name=\"Cotterell and Cotterell, 144\">{{harvp|Cotterell|Cotterell|1975|p= 144}}</ref> Many of those so favored originated from the North China plain.<ref>{{harvp|Fairbank|1992|p= 81}}</ref> Through a process of eliminating or diminishing the power of the established aristocracy, whom she perceived as disloyal to her, and establishing a reformed upper class in China loyal to her, Wu Zetian made major social changes which are still being evaluated by historians.\n\n[[File:Maitreya-Tang Dynasty-side.JPG|thumb|left|upright|[[Maitreya]] statue from the reign of Wu Zetian]]\n\nWu Zetian used her power to increase or to attempt to increase her power by manipulating Buddhist, [[Daoist]], and Confucianist practice, sometimes in reference to the idea of the [[Mandate of Heaven]]. There are also allegations of witchcraft or sorcery. Wu began to manipulate the symbolic aspects of religious and imperial power long before she became ''huangdi'', one case being the Sacrifice on Mount Tai, in 666. When Emperor Gaozong offered sacrifices to the deities of heaven and earth at [[Mount Tai]], Empress Wu, in an unprecedented action, offered sacrifices after him, with Princess Dowager Yan, mother of Emperor Gaozong's brother [[Li Zhen (Tang dynasty)|Li Zhen]], Prince of Yue, offering sacrifices after her.<ref name=ZZTJ201 /> Wu Zetian's procession of ladies up Mount Tai conspicuously linked Wu with the most sacred traditional rites of the Chinese empire.<ref name=\"Paludan, 99\" />\n\nMany of Wu Zetian's measures were of a popular nature, and helped her to gain support for her rule. Wu Zetian came to power during a time in China in which the people were fairly contented, the administration was run well, and the economy was characterized by rising living standards.<ref name=\"Paludan, 96\" /> Wu Zetian, as far as the masses were for the most part concerned, continued in this manner. She was determined that free, self-sufficient farmers would continue to work on their own farm land, so she periodically used the [[Equal-field system|''juntian'', equal-field system]], together with updated census figures to ensure fair land allocations, re-allocating as necessary.<ref name=\"Fairbank, 82\" /> Much of her success was due to her various edicts (including those known as her \"Acts of Grace\") which helped to satisfy the needs of the lower classes through various acts of relief, her widening recruitment to government service to include previously excluded gentry and commoners, and by her generous promotions and pay raises for the lower ranks.<ref name=\"Paludan, 100\" />\n\nWu Zetian used her military and diplomatic skills to enhance her position. The [[Fubing system|''fubing'' system]] of self-supportive soldier-farmer colonies, which provided local militia and labor services for her government, allowed her to maintain her armed forces at reduced expense.<ref name=\"Fairbank, 82\" /> She also pursued a policy of military action to expand the empire to its furthest extent ever up to that point in Central Asia. Expansion efforts against [[Tibet]] and to the northwest were less successful. Allying with the Korean kingdom of Silla [[Goguryeo\u2013Tang War|against Goguryeo]] with the promise of ceding Goguryeo's territory to Silla, Chinese forces [[Silla-Tang War|occupied Goguryeo]] after its defeat, and even began to occupy Silla territory. Silla resisted the imposition of Chinese rule, and by allying with Goguryeo and Baekche, was able to expel its former ally from the peninsula. Hong argues that Silla's success was in part due to a shift in Empress Wu's focus to Tibet and inadequate support for the forces in the Korean peninsula.{{sfn|Hong|2007|244\u201345}} Despite victories against Tibetans and Turks:<ref>{{harvp|Paludan|1998|pp=96\u201397}}</ref> however, in 694, Wu's forces decisively defeated the Tibetan\u2013Western Turk alliance, and retook the [[Four Garrisons of Anxi]], lost in 668.<ref>{{harvp|Beckwith|2009|pp=130\u2013131}}</ref>\n\nAnother significant event of Wu Zetian's reign was 651, shortly after the [[Muslim conquest of Persia]], when the first Arab ambassador arrived in China.<ref name=\"Paludan, 96\" />\n\n== Literature ==\n=== North Gate Scholars ===\nToward the end of Gaozong's life, Wu began engaging a number of mid-level officials who had literary talent, including Yuan Wanqing ({{lang|zh|\u5143\u842c\u9803}}), [[Liu Yizhi]], [[Fan L\u00fcbing]], Miao Chuke ({{lang|zh|\u82d7\u695a\u5ba2}}), Zhou Simao ({{lang|zh|\u5468\u601d\u8302}}), and Han Chubin ({{lang|zh|\u97d3\u695a\u8cd3}}), to write a number of works on her behalf, including the ''Biographies of Notable Women'' ({{lang|zh|\u5217\u5973\u50b3}}), ''Guidelines for Imperial Subjects'' ({{lang|zh|\u81e3\u8ecc}}), and ''New Teachings for Official Staff Members'' ({{lang|zh|\u767e\u50da\u65b0\u8aa1}}). Collectively, they became known as the \"North Gate Scholars\" ({{lang|zh|\u5317\u9580\u5b78\u58eb}}), because they served inside the palace, which was to the north of the imperial government buildings, and Empress Wu sought advice from them to divert the powers of the chancellors.<ref name=\"ZZTJ202\" />\n\n=== The \"Twelve Suggestions\" ===\nAround the new year 675, Empress Wu submitted twelve suggestions. One was that the work of [[Laozi]] (whose family name was Li and to whom the Tang imperial clan traced its ancestry), [[Tao Te Ching]], should be added to the required reading for imperial university students. Another was that a three-year mourning period should be observed for a mother's death in all cases, not only in those cases when the father was no longer alive.

She changed the name of the state to Zhou, claiming ancestry from the [[Zhou dynasty]], and took the throne as Empress Regnant (with the title of Empress Regnant Shengshen ({{lang|zh|\u8056\u795e\u7687\u5e1d}}), literally \"Divine and Sacred Emperor or Empress Regnant\"). Emperor Ruizong was deposed and made crown prince with the atypical title of ''Huangsi'' ({{lang|zh|\u7687\u55e3}}).<ref name=\"ZZTJ204\" /> This thus interrupted the Tang dynasty, and she became the first (and only) woman to reign over China as Empress Regnant.{{NoteTag|During Emperor Taizong's reign, a female agrarian rebel leader named [[Chen Shuozhen]] ({{lang|zh|\u9673\u78a9\u771e}}) had declared herself \"emperor\" with the title Emperor Wenjia ({{lang|zh|\u6587\u4f73\u7687\u5e1d}}), but as Chen was quickly defeated and killed, she is typically not considered a true \"emperor\".

Forty-six of Wu's poems are collected in the ''[[Quan Tangshi]]'' \"Collected Tang Poems\" and sixty-one essays under her name are recorded in the ''Quan Tangwen'' \"Collected Tang Essays\".<ref>{{Cite book |title = Women writers of traditional China: an anthology of poetry and criticism\n |authors = [[Kang-i Sun Chang]], [[Haun Saussy]], Charles Yim-tze Kwong\n |year = 1999\n |publisher = Stanford University Press\n |page = 31\n}}</ref> Although a lot of those writings serve political ends, there is one poem in which she laments her mother after she died and expresses her despair at not being able to see her again.\n\nDuring Wu Zetian's reign, the imperial court produced various works for which she was a sponsor, such as the anthology of the poetry of her court known as the ''[[Zhuying ji]]'' \"Collection of Precious Glories\", which contained poems by [[Cui Rong]], [[Li Jiao (Tang dynasty)|Li Jiao]], [[Zhang Yue (Tang dynasty)|Zhang Yue]], and others, arranged according to the official rank at the court of the individuals included.<ref>{{harvp|Yu|2002|p= 56}}</ref> Among the literary developments that took place during the time of Wu Zetian (and partly at her court) was the final stylistic development of the \"new style\" poetry of the [[Regulated verse|regulated verse (''jintishi'')]], by the poetic pair [[Song Zhiwen]] and [[Shen Quanqi]].\n\nWu Zetian also engaged in patronage of scholars by founding an institute to produce the ''Collection of Biographies of Famous Women''.<ref name=\"Paludan, 99\" /> The development of what is considered to be characteristic [[Tang poetry]] is traditionally ascribed to [[Chen Zi'ang]],<ref>{{harvp|Watson|1971|p= 115}}</ref> one of Wu's ministers.\n\n=== Literary allusions ===\n{{unreferenced section|date=February 2017}}\n\nConsidering the events of her life, literary allusions to Wu Zetian may carry several connotations: a woman who has inappropriately overstepped her bounds, the [[hypocrisy]] of preaching [[compassion]] while simultaneously engaging in a pattern of [[political corruption]] and vicious behavior and ruling by pulling strings in the background. For many centuries, Wu was used by the establishment as an example of what can go wrong when a woman is placed in charge.\n\nSuch sexist opposition to her was only lifted during the late 1960s when [[Mao Zedong]]'s wife [[Jiang Qing]] rehabilitated Wu as part of a propaganda campaign to suggest she be considered as a successor to her ailing husband.\n\nIn his biography ''Wu'', British author [[Jonathan Clements]] has pointed out that these wildly differing uses of a historical figure often have led to schizophrenic and often hysterical characterizations. Many alleged poisonings and other incidents, such as the premature death of her daughter, may have rational explanations that have been twisted by later opponents.\n\n== Evaluation ==\n=== Quotes ===\nThe traditional Chinese historical view on Wu Zetian generally was mixed\u2014admiring her for her abilities in governing the state, but vilifying her for her actions in seizing imperial power. [[Luo Binwang]] even wrote along these lines in a declaration during her lifetime, in support of Li Jingye's rebellion. Typical was a commentary by the [[Later Jin (Five Dynasties)|Later Jin dynasty]] historian [[Liu Xu]], the lead editor of the ''[[Old Book of Tang]]'':<ref>{{harvp|Old Book of Tang||loc= [[:zh:s:\u820a\u5510\u66f8/\u53776|vol. 6]]}}</ref>\n\n{{quote|The year that Lady Wu declared herself regent, heroic individuals were all mournful of the unfortunate turn of events, worried that the dynasty would fall, and concerned that they could not repay the grace of the deceased emperor [i.e., Emperor Gaozong] and protect his sons. Soon thereafter, great accusations arose, and many innocent people were falsely accused and stuck their necks out in waiting for execution. Heaven and earth became like a huge cage, and even if one could escape it, where could he go? That was lamentable. In the past, the trick of covering the nose{{NoteTag|This was a reference to a story relayed in the ''[[Han Feizi (book)|Han Feizi]]''. In the story, it was mentioned that the king of [[Qi (state)|Qi]] gave a beautiful woman to [[King Huai of Chu]] as a gift, to be his concubine. King Huai's jealous wife Queen Zheng Xiu ({{lang|zh|\u912d\u8896}}) told her, \"The King loves you greatly, but dislikes your nose. If you cover your nose whenever you see him, you can ensure that he will continue to be loved by him. She accepted Queen Zheng's suggestion. When King Huai asked Queen Zheng, \"Why does she cover her nose when she sees me?\" Queen Zheng responded, \"She often said that Your Majesty had a stench to you.\" King Huai, in anger, yelled, \"Cut off her nose!\"}} surprised the realm in its poisonousness, and the disaster of the human pig{{NoteTag|This is a reference to the torture that [[Emperor Gao of Han]]'s wife [[Empress L\u00fc Zhi]] carried out against Emperor Gao's favorite concubine [[Consort Qi]] after Emperor Gao's death, once Empress L\u00fc became empress dowager\u2014by cutting her limbs off, blinding her, deafening her, and referring to her as the human pig ({{lang|zh|\u4eba\u5f58}}).}} caused the entire state to mourn. In order to take over as empress, Empress Wu strangled her own infant daughter; her willingness to crush her own flesh and blood showed how great her viciousness and vile nature was, although this is nothing more than what evil individuals and jealous women might do. However, she accepted the words of righteousness and honored the upright. Although she was like a hen that crowed, she eventually returned the rightful rule to her son. She quickly dispelled the accusation against Wei Yuanzhong, comforted Di Renjie with kind words, respected the will of the times and suppressed her favorites, and listened to honest words and ended the terror of the secret police officials. This was good, this was good.}}\n\nSome of the diversity in terms of points of agreement and even outright divergences in modern evaluations of Wu Zetian can be seen in the following quotes by modern non-Chinese authors:\n\n{{quote|\"Wu Zetian (690\u2013705) was an extraordinary woman, attractive, exceptionally gifted, politically astute and an excellent judge of men. With single minded determination, she overcame the opposition of the Confucian establishment through her own efforts, unique among palace women by not using her own family.\n\"Her rise to power was steeped in blood....\" [[Ann Paludan]]<ref>{{harvp|Paludan|1998|p= 98}}</ref>}}\n\n{{quote|\"To the horror of traditional Chinese historians, all members of the ''shih'' class, the continued success of the T'ang was in large measure due to an ex-concubine who finally usurped the throne itself....Though she was ruthless towards her enemies, the period of her ascendency was a good one for China. Government was sound, no rebellions occurred, abuses in the army and administration were stamped out and Korea was annexed, an achievement no previous Chinese had ever managed.\" Yong Yap Cotterell and Arthur Cotterell.<ref name=\"Cotterell and Cotterell, 144\" />}}\n\n{{quote|\"China's only woman ruler, Empress Wu was a remarkably skilled and able politician, but her murderous and illicit methods of maintaining power gave her a bad reputation among male bureaucrats. It also fostered overstaffing and many kinds of corruption.\" John King Fairbank<ref name=\"Fairbank, 82\" />}}\n\n=== Confucian viewpoints ===\nWu Zetian's rise and reign has been criticized harshly by [[Neo-Confucianism|neo-Confucian]] historians, but has been viewed in a different and positive light after the 1950s.\n\nIn the early period of the Tang dynasty, because all the emperors were her direct descendants, the evaluation for Wu Zetian were relatively positive. Commentary in subsequent periods, however, especially the book ''[[Zizhi Tongjian]]'' compiled by Sima Guang, criticized Wu Zetian harshly. By the period of Southern [[Song dynasty]], when [[Neo-Confucianism]] was firmly established as the mainstream political ideology of China, their ideology determined the evaluation for Wu Zetian.{{Citation needed|date=August 2018}}\n\n== Era names ==\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n| colspan=\"4\" style=\"text-align:center;\" | Zhou dynasty (690\u2013705): ''Convention: use personal name''\n|-\n!

Wu was the only [[queen regnant|empress regnant]] (or female [[Emperor of China|emperor]]) in the [[history of China]].\n\nWu was the concubine of [[Emperor Taizong of Tang|Emperor Taizong]]. After his death, she married his successor\u2014his ninth son, [[Emperor Gaozong of Tang|Emperor Gaozong]], officially becoming Gaozong's ''[[Imperial consorts of Tang China|huanghou]]'' ({{lang|zh|\u7687\u540e}}, empress consort, title for the reigning emperor's main consort) in 655, although having considerable political power prior to this. After Gaozong's debilitating stroke in 660, Wu Zetian became administrator of the court, a position equal to the emperor's until 705.<ref name=\"Paludan, 96\">{{harvp|Paludan|1998|p=96}}</ref>\n\nAfter her wedding to [[Emperor Gaozong of Tang|Emperor Gaozong]] in 655, Empress  Wu's rise to power was swift. A strong, charismatic, and well-educated woman who enjoyed the absolute interest of her husband, Empress  Wu was the most powerful and influential woman at court during a period when the Tang Empire was at the peak of its power and glory. More decisive and proactive than her husband, she is considered by historians to have been the real [[power behind the throne]] and [[ruling figure]] for more than Eighteen years. Empress  Wu was granted certain honours and privileges which were not enjoyed by any Chinese empresses before or after And after Gauzong's death, Empress Wu as Empress dowager and regent conquered power independently and uniquely, and Seven years later, she seized the throne in the Zhou dynasty, and becoming the only female emperor in Chinese history.\n\nThe importance to history of Wu Zetian's period of political and military leadership includes the major expansion of the Chinese empire, extending it far beyond its previous territorial limits, deep into [[Central Asia]], and engaging in a series of wars on the [[Korean Peninsula]], first [[Goguryeo\u2013Tang War|allying with Silla against Goguryeo]], and then [[Silla\u2013Tang War|against Silla]] over the occupation of former [[Goguryeo]] territory. Within China, besides the more direct consequences of her struggle to gain and maintain supreme power, Wu's leadership resulted in important effects regarding social class in Chinese society and in relation to state support for [[Taoism]], [[Buddhism]], education, and literature. Wu Zetian also had a monumental impact upon the statuary of the [[Longmen Grottoes]] and the \"Wordless Stele\" at the [[Qianling Mausoleum]], as well as the construction of some major buildings and bronze castings that no longer survive.\n\nBesides her career as a political leader, Wu Zetian also had an active family life. Although family relationships sometimes became problematic, Wu Zetian was the mother of four sons, three of whom also carried the title of emperor, although one held that title only as a posthumous honor. One of her grandsons became the renowned [[Emperor Xuanzong of Tang]].\n\n== Names and titles ==\n{{Further|Chinese name}}\n\nIn Chinese history and literature, Wu Zetian ({{IPA-cmn|\u00f9 ts\u0264\u030c t\u02b0j\u025b\u0301n}}) was known by various names and titles. Mention of her in the English language has only increased their number. A difficulty in English translations from Chinese is that English translations tend to specify gender (as in the case of \"emperor\" versus \"empress\" or \"prince\" versus \"princess\"); whereas, in [[Classical Chinese]], words such as ''hou'' ({{lang|zh|\u540e}}, \"sovereign\", \"prince\", \"queen\") or ''huangdi'' {{lang|zh|(\u7687\u5e1d}}, \"imperial supreme ruler\", \"royal deity\") are of a [[Grammatical gender#Indeterminate gender|grammatically indeterminate gender]].\n\n=== Names ===\nThe exact birth name of Wu Zetian is no longer retrievable. She changed her name to Wu Zhao after rising to power,<ref name=\"Paludan, 100\" /> often written as {{lang|zh|\u6b66\u66cc}}, ({{lang|zh|\u66cc}} has also been written as {{lang|zh|\u77be}} on occasion, and both are derivatives of {{lang|zh|\u7167}}, which possibly is her original name), with \u77be being one of the invented characters by Wu. Wu was her patronymic surname, which she retained, according to traditional Chinese practice, after marriage to Gaozong, of the Li family. Emperor Taizong gave her the [[art name]] Wu Mei ({{lang|zh|\u6b66\u5a9a}}), meaning \"glamorous\".<ref name=\"NBT76\" /> (Thus, today Chinese people often refer to her as Wu Mei or Wu Meiniang ({{lang|zh|\u6b66\u5a9a\u5a18}}) when they write about her youth, whereas they refer to her as Wu Hou ({{lang|zh|\u6b66\u540e}}) when referring to her as empress consort and empress dowager, and Wu Zetian ({{lang|zh|\u6b66\u5247\u5929}}) when referring to her reign as empress regnant.){{Citation needed|date=February 2008}}\n\n=== Titles  ===\nDuring her life, and posthumously, Wu Zetian was awarded various official titles.

Generally, the monarch was male and his chief spouse was given a title such as ''huanghou'' ({{lang|zh|\u7687\u540e}}), often translated as \"empress\" or more specific \"empress consort\". Upon the death of the emperor, the surviving empress consort could become [[empress dowager]], sometimes wielding considerable political power as [[Regency (government)|regent]] during the [[Minority reign|minority]] of the (male) heir to the position of emperor.\n\nSince the time of [[Qin Shi Huang]] (259\u2013210 BC) the [[Emperor of China]] used the title ''huangdi'' ({{lang|zh|\u7687\u5e1d}}, translated as \"emperor\" or \"empress (regnant)\" as appropriate).

In the same year, a [[List of solar eclipses in the 7th century|total eclipse of the sun]] was visible across China. Her father [[Wu Shihuo]] was engaged in the timber business and the family was relatively well off. Her mother was from the powerful Yang family. During the final years of [[Emperor Yang of Sui]], Li Yuan ({{lang|zh|\u674e\u6df5}}) (who would go on to become Emperor Gaozu of Tang) stayed in the Wu household many times and became close to the Wu family, whilst holding appointments in both Hedong and [[Taiyuan]]. After Li Yuan overthrew Emperor Yang, he was generous to the Wu family, providing them with money, grain, land, and clothing. Once the Tang dynasty became established, Wu Shihou held a succession of senior ministerial posts including governor of [[Yangzhou]], Lizhou, and Jingzhou ({{lang|zh|\u834a\u5dde}}) (modern day [[Jiangling County]], [[Hubei]]).\n\nWu Zetian was born into a rich family. She had servants at her disposal to perform routine tasks for her, so there were not many domestic jobs that Wu would ever have to learn. Because of this, Wu was encouraged by her father to read books and pursue her education.

Empress Wang, seeing that Emperor Gaozong was still impressed by Consort Wu's beauty, hoped that the arrival of a new concubine would divert the emperor from Consort Xiao, and therefore secretly told Consort Wu to stop shaving her hair and, at a later point, welcomed her to the palace. (Some modern historians dispute this traditional account, and some think that Consort Wu never had left the imperial palace and might have had an affair with Emperor Gaozong while Emperor Taizong was still alive.){{Citation needed|date=February 2008}}\n\nConsort Wu soon overtook Consort Xiao as Emperor Gaozong's favourite. In 652, she gave birth to her first child, a son named [[Li Hong]]. In 653, she gave birth to another son, [[Li Xian (prince)|Li Xi\u00e1n]]. Neither of these sons were in contention to be Emperor Gaozong's heir because Emperor Gaozong had, at the request of officials influenced by Empress Wang and her uncle, the chancellor [[Liu Shi (Tang dynasty)|Liu Shi]], designated his oldest son [[Li Zhong]] as his heir. Li Zhong's mother, Consort Liu, was of lowly birth and Empress Wang expected her gratitude. By 654, both Empress Wang and Consort Xiao had lost favour with Emperor Gaozong, and these two former romantic rivals joined forces against Consort Wu, but to no avail. As a sign of his love for Consort Wu, in 654 Emperor Gaozong conferred posthumous honors on her father [[Wu Shihuo]].\n\nAs the year 654 continued, shortly after Consort Wu had given birth to her daughter, the baby died, with some evidence suggesting deliberate [[Strangling|strangulation]], including allegations by Wu, the child's mother. Consort Wu accused Wang of murder.<ref name=\"Paludan, 96\" /> Wu's rival Wang was accused of having been seen near the child's room, with corroborating testimony by alleged eyewitnesses. Emperor Gaozong was led to believe that Wang had the means to kill the child, and likely done so, motivated by jealousy. Wang lacked an alibi, and was unable to clear herself. Angry, Emperor Gaozong considered deposing Empress Wang and elevating Consort Wu to her position; but, first he wanted to make sure that the government chancellors would support this. So, Gaozong visited the house of his uncle [[Zhangsun Wuji]], the head chancellor, together with Consort Wu (later Emperor Gaozong would award Chancellor Zhangsun with much treasure). During the meeting, Gaozong several times brought up the topic of Empress Wang's childlessness, a topic easily leading to an excuse sufficient to depose her; however, Zhangsun repeatedly found ways to divert the conversation. Subsequent visits by Consort Wu's mother Lady Yang and the official [[Xu Jingzong]], who was allied with Consort Wu, to seek support from Zhangsun also were to no avail.<ref name=\"ZZTJ199\">{{harvp|Zizhi Tongjian|1084|loc= [[:zh:s:\u8cc7\u6cbb\u901a\u9451/\u5377199|vol. 199]]}}</ref> Scientifically credible [[forensic pathology]] information about the death of the child does not exist, and scholars lack real, concrete evidence about her death. However, speculation seems to continue.\n\nAs traditional folklore tends to portray Wu as a power hungry woman with no care for who she hurt or what she did, the most popular theory is that Wu killed her own child in order to implicate Wang. Other schools of thought argue that Wang indeed killed the child out of jealousy and hatred toward Wu since Wang had no children of her own. The third argument is that the child died of [[asphyxiation]] or [[crib death]], considering that the ventilation systems of the time were non-existent or of poor quality. Lack of ventilation combined with using coal as a heating method could lead to a build-up of fumes that would lead to [[carbon monoxide poisoning]]. No matter what caused the death of the child, Wu blamed Wang for it and Wang was removed from her position as Empress.\n\nIn summer 655, Consort Wu accused Empress Wang and her mother, Lady Liu, of using witchcraft. In response, Emperor Gaozong barred Lady Liu from the palace and demoted Empress Wang's uncle, Liu Shi.<ref name=\"ZZTJ199\" /> Meanwhile, a faction of officials began to form around Consort Wu, including [[Li Yifu]], Xu, Cui Yixuan ({{lang|zh|\u5d14\u7fa9\u7384}}), and Yuan Gongyu ({{lang|zh|\u8881\u516c\u745c}}). On an occasion in the autumn of 655, Emperor Gaozong summoned the chancellors Zhangsun, [[Li Shiji|Li Ji]], [[Yu Zhining]], and [[Chu Suiliang]] to the palace\u2014which Chu deduced to be regarding the matter of changing who was the Empress. Li Ji claimed an illness and refused to attend. At the meeting, Chu vehemently opposed deposing Empress Wang, while Zhangsun and Yu showed their disapproval by silence. Meanwhile, other chancellors [[Han Yuan]] and [[Lai Ji]] also opposed the move, but when Emperor Gaozong asked Li Ji again, Li Ji's response was, \"This is your family matter, Your Imperial Majesty. Why ask anyone else?\" Emperor Gaozong, therefore, became resolved. He demoted Chu to be a commandant at [[Tanzhou (in modern Hunan)|Tan Prefecture]] (roughly modern [[Changsha]], [[Hunan]]),<ref name=\"ZZTJ199\" /> and then deposed both Empress Wang and Consort Xiao, putting them under arrest and creating Consort Wu as empress to replace Empress Wang. (Later that year, Empress Wang and Consort Xiao were killed on orders by the new Empress Wu after Emperor Gaozong showed signs of considering their release. After their deaths, however, Empress Wu often was haunted by them in her dreams. For the rest of Emperor Gaozong's reign, Emperor Gaozong and she often took up residence at the eastern capital [[Luoyang]] and only infrequently spent time in [[Chang'an]].)<ref name=\"ZZTJ200\">{{harvp|Zizhi Tongjian|1084|loc= [[:zh:s:\u8cc7\u6cbb\u901a\u9451/\u5377200|vol. 200]]}}</ref>\n\n==Reign as Empress consort==\n\n===Rivals Elimination Period===\nIn 655, Wu became Tang Gaozong's new empress consort ({{lang|zh|\u7687\u540e}}, ''h\u00faangh\u00f2u'').\n\nIn 656, on the advice of Xu Jingzong, Emperor Gaozong deposed Consort Liu's son Li Zhong from being his heir apparent, changing his status to being the Prince of Liang, while designating Wu's son Li Hong, then carrying the title of Prince of Dai, as crown prince (that is, Heir Apparent).<ref name=\"ZZTJ200\" />\n\nIn 657, Empress Wu and her allies began reprisals against officials who had opposed her ascension. She first had Xu and Li Yifu, who were by now chancellors, falsely accuse Han Yuan and Lai Ji of being complicit with Chu Suiliang in planning treason. The three of them, along with Liu Shi, were demoted to being prefects of remote prefectures, with provisions that they would never be allowed to return to Chang'an. In 659, she further had Xu accuse Zhangsun Wuji of plotting treason with the low-level officials Wei Jifang ({{lang|zh|\u97cb\u5b63\u65b9}}) and Li Chao ({{lang|zh|\u674e\u5de2}}). Zhangsun was exiled and, later in the year, was forced to commit suicide in exile. Xu further implicated Chu, Liu, Han, and Yu Zhining in the plot as well. Chu, who had died in 658, was posthumously stripped of his titles, and his sons Chu Yanfu ({{lang|zh|\u891a\u5f65\u752b}}) and Chu Yanchong ({{lang|zh|\u891a\u5f65\u6c96}}) were executed. Orders also were issued to execute Liu and Han, although Han died before the execution order reached his location. It was said that after this time, no official dared to criticize the emperor.\n\nIn 660, Li Zhong, Gaozong's first-born son (to consort Liu) also was targeted. Li Zhong had feared that he would be next and had sought out advice of fortune tellers. Wu had him exiled and placed under house arrest.<ref name=\"ZZTJ200\" />\n\n===As the real and influential power behind the Emperor===\n\nIn 660, Emperor Gaozong and Empress Wu toured Bian Prefecture (modern-day Taiyuan), and Empress Wu had the opportunity to invite her old neighbors and relatives to a feast.<ref name=\"ZZTJ200\" /> Later that year, Emperor Gaozong began to suffer from an illness that carried the symptoms of painful headaches and loss of vision, generally thought to be hypertension-related,<ref>See, ''Bo Yang Edition of the Zizhi Tongjian'', vol. 40, p 683.</ref> and he began to have Empress Wu make rulings on petitions made by officials. It was said that Empress Wu had quick reactions and understood both literature and history, and therefore, she was making correct rulings. Thereafter, her authority rivaled Emperor Gaozong's, after this point on, Empress Wu became the undisputed power behind the throne for twenty-three years.<ref name=\"ZZTJ200\" />\n\nBy 664, Empress Wu was said to be interfering so much in the imperial governance that she was angering Emperor Gaozong. Further, she had engaged the [[Taoist]] sorcerer Guo Xingzhen ({{lang|zh|\u90ed\u884c\u771f}}) in using witchcraft\u2014an act that was prohibited by regulations and which had led to Empress Wang's downfall\u2014and the [[Eunuch (court official)|eunuch]] Wang Fusheng ({{lang|zh|\u738b\u4f0f\u52dd}}) reported this to Emperor Gaozong, further angering him. He consulted the chancellor [[Shangguan Yi]], who suggested that he depose Empress Wu. He had Shangguan draft an edict, but as Shangguan was doing so Empress Wu received news of what was happening. She went to the emperor to plead her case, just as he was holding the edict that Shangguan had drafted. Emperor Gaozong could not bear to depose her, blaming the episode on Shangguan. As both Shangguan and Wang had served on Li Zhong's staff, Empress Wu had Xu falsely accuse Shangguan, Wang, and Li Zhong of planning treason. Shangguan, Wang, and Shangguan's son Shangguan Tingzhi ({{lang|zh|\u4e0a\u5b98\u5ead\u829d}}) were executed, while Li Zhong was forced to commit suicide.<ref name=\"ZZTJ201\">{{harvp|Zizhi Tongjian|1084|loc= [[:zh:s:\u8cc7\u6cbb\u901a\u9451/\u5377201|vol. 201]]}}</ref> (Shangguan Tingzhi's daughter [[Shangguan Wan'er]], then an infant, and her mother, Lady Zheng, became slaves in the inner palace. After Shangguan Wan'er grew up, she eventually became a trusted secretary for Empress Wu.) Thereafter, at imperial meetings for eighteen years, Empress Wu would sit behind a pearl screen behind Emperor  Gaozong, hear the reports as well, and imperial powers often fell into her hands, and she effectively was making the major decisions and even held court independently when the Emperor was unwell And in the absence of her husband, she gained vast powers and Empress Wu had the ultimate power, and she became a Controversial and formidable figure with far-reaching influence. She and Emperor Gaozong were thereafter referred to as the \"Two Saints.\" ({{lang|zh|\u4e8c\u8056}}, ''Er Sheng'').<ref name=\"ZZTJ201\" />\n\nMeanwhile, on Empress Wu's account, her mother Lady Yang had been created the Lady of Rong, and her older sister, now widowed, the Lady of Han. Her brothers Wu Yuanqing and Wu Yuanshuang and cousins Wu Weiliang and Wu Huaiyun, despite the poor relationships that they had with Lady Yang, were promoted. At a feast that Lady Yang held for them, however, Wu Weiliang offended Lady Yang by stating that they did not find it honorable for them to be promoted on account of Empress Wu. Empress Wu, therefore, requested to have them demoted to remote prefectures\u2014outwardly to show modesty, but in reality to avenge the offense to her mother. Wu Yuanqing and Wu Yuanshuang died in effective exile. Meanwhile, in or before 666, Lady of Han died as well, and after her death, Emperor Gaozong created her daughter the Lady of Wei and considered keeping her in the palace\u2014possibly as a concubine\u2014but did not immediately do so, as he feared that Empress Wu would be displeased. It was said that Empress Wu heard of this and was nevertheless displeased, and she had the Lady of Wei poisoned, by placing poison in food offerings that Wu Weiliang and Wu Huaiyun had made and then blaming Wu Weiliang and Wu Huaiyun for the murder. Wu Weiliang and Wu Huaiyun were executed.<ref name=\"ZZTJ201\" /><ref name=\"WuShihuo\">For Wu Shihuo's career and family, see generally ''[[Old Book of Tang]]'', [[:zh:s:\u820a\u5510\u66f8/\u537758|vol. 58]] and ''New Book of Tang'', [[:zh:s:\u65b0\u5510\u66f8/\u5377206|vol. 206]]</ref>\n\nIn 670, Wu's mother, Lady Yang, died and by Emperor Gaozong's orders, all of the imperial officials and their wives attended her wake and mourned her. Later that year, with the realm suffering from a major drought, Empress Wu offered to be deposed, an offer Emperor Gaozong rejected. He further posthumously honored Wu Shihuo (who had previously been posthumously honored as the Duke of Zhou) and Lady Yang by giving them the titles of the Prince and Princess of Taiyuan.<ref name=\"ZZTJ201\" />\n\nMeanwhile, the son of Wu's older sister, the Lady of Han, (Wu's nephew) Helan Minzhi ({{lang|zh|\u8cc0\u862d\u654f\u4e4b}}) had been given the surname of Wu and allowed to inherit the title of Duke of Zhou. As it was becoming clear, however, that he was suspecting Empress Wu of having murdered his sister, Empress Wu began to take precautions against him, he also was said to have had an incestuous relationship with his grandmother Lady Yang. In 671, Helan Minzhi was accused of having disobeyed mourning regulations during the period of mourning for Lady Yang, and also of raping the daughter of the official Yang Sijian ({{lang|zh|\u694a\u601d\u5109}}), whom Emperor Gaozong and Empress Wu had previously selected to be the wife and crown princess for Li Hong. Helan Minzhi was exiled and either was executed in exile or committed suicide. In 674, Empress Wu had Wu Yuanshuang's son [[Wu Chengsi]] recalled from exile to inherit the title of Duke of Zhou.<ref name=\"ZZTJ202\">{{harvp|Zizhi Tongjian|1084|loc= [[:zh:s:\u8cc7\u6cbb\u901a\u9451/\u5377202|vol. 202]]}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Luoyang 2006 7-29.jpg|thumb|The Fengxian cave (c. 675) of the [[Longmen Grottoes]], commissioned by Wu Zetian; the large, central Buddha is representative of the ''[[Vairocana]]'']]\n\nIn 675, with Emperor Gaozong's illness getting worse, he considered having Empress Wu formally rule as [[regent]]. The chancellor [[Hao Chujun]] and the official [[Li Yiyan]] both opposed this, and he did not formally make her regent, Although Wu, as empress, had rather in the absence of her husband relatively of the emperor more political power and was often ahead of the Emperor Gaozong.\n\nAlso in 675, a number of people would fall victim to Empress Wu's ire. Empress Wu had been displeased at the favor that Emperor Gaozong had shown his aunt, Princess Changle, who had married the general Zhao Gui ({{lang|zh|\u8d99\u74cc}}) and whose daughter had become the wife and princess of Wu's third son Li Xi\u01cen, the Prince of Zhou. Princess Zhao was therefore accused of unspecified crimes and put under arrest, eventually being starved to death. Zhao Gui and Princess Changle were exiled. Meanwhile, later that month, Li Hong, the Crown Prince\u2014who had been urging Empress Wu not to exercise so much influence on Emperor Gaozong's governance and who had offended Empress Wu by requesting that his half-sisters, Consort Xiao's daughters, Princess Yiyang and Xuancheng, who had been under house arrest, be allowed to marry\u2014died suddenly. Traditional historians generally believed that Empress Wu poisoned Li Hong to death. Li Xi\u00e1n, then carrying the title of Prince of Yong, was created crown prince.<ref name=\"ZZTJ202\" /> Meanwhile, Consort Xiao's son Li Sujie and another son of Emperor Gaozong's, [[Li Shangjin]] ({{lang|zh|\u674e\u4e0a\u91d1}}), were repeatedly accused of crimes by Empress Wu and were demoted.<ref name=\"ZZTJ202\" />\n\nSoon Empress Wu's relationship with Li Xi\u00e1n also deteriorated, as Li Xi\u00e1n had become unsettled after hearing rumors that he was not born to Empress Wu\u2014but to her sister, the Lady of Han\u2014and when Empress Wu heard of his fearfulness, she became angry with him. Further, the sorcerer Ming Chongyan ({{lang|zh|\u660e\u5d07\u513c}}), whom both she and Emperor Gaozong respected and who had stated that Li Xi\u00e1n was unsuitable to inherit the throne, was assassinated in 679. The assassins were not caught\u2014causing Wu to suspect that Li Xi\u00e1n was behind the assassination. In 680, Li Xi\u00e1n was accused of crimes and during an investigation by the officials [[Xue Yuanchao]], [[Pei Yan]], and [[Gao Zhizhou]], a large number of arms were found in Li Xi\u00e1n's palace. Empress Wu formally accused Li Xi\u00e1n of treason and the assassination of Ming. Li Xi\u00e1n was deposed and exiled.\n\nAfter, the exile of Li Xi\u00e1n, his younger brother Li Xi\u01cen [similar-sounding name but different Chinese characters] (who had by now been renamed Li Zhe) was created crown prince.<ref name=\"ZZTJ202\" />\n\nIn 681, Princess Taiping was married to Xue Shao ({{lang|zh|\u859b\u7d39}}), the son of Emperor Gaozong's sister Princess Chengyang, in a grand ceremony. Empress Wu, initially unimpressed with the lineages of Xue Shao's brothers' wives, wanted to order his brothers to divorce their wives\u2014stopping only after it was pointed out to her that Lady Xiao, the wife of Xue Shao's older brother Xue Yi ({{lang|zh|\u859b\u9857}}), was a grandniece of the deceased chancellor [[Xiao Yu]].<ref name=\"ZZTJ202\" />\n\nIn late 683, Emperor Gaozong died while at Luoyang. Li Zhe took the throne (as [[Emperor Zhongzong of Tang|Emperor Zhongzong]]), but Empress Wu retained the real authority as [[empress dowager]] and regent.<ref name=\"ZZTJ203\">{{harvp|Zizhi Tongjian|1084|loc= [[:zh:s:\u8cc7\u6cbb\u901a\u9451/\u5377203|vol. 203]]}}</ref>\n\n==Reign as Empress dowager==\n===As regent for Emperor Zhongzong===\nUpon the death of her husband Emperor Gaozong, Wu became empress dowager ({{lang|zh|\u7687\u592a\u540e}}, ''h\u00faangt\u00e0ih\u00f2u'') and then regent and had the power to remove and install emperors And, as in the past, government decisions were taken by her. Wu already had poisoned the crown prince Li Hong and had enough other princes exiled that her third son, [[Emperor Zhongzong of Tang|Li Zhe]], had been made heir apparent. Furthermore, Gaozong's will included provisions that Li Zhe should ascend immediately to the imperial throne, and that he should look to Empress Wu in regard to any important matter, either military or civil.<ref name=\"Paludan, 97\">{{harvp|Paludan|1998|p= 97}}</ref> In the second month of 684, Li Zhe ascended to the imperial throne, taking the regnal name of Zhongzong, for the short six weeks of his reign.\n\nImmediately, Emperor Zhongzong showed signs of disobeying Empress Dowager Wu. Emperor Zhongzong was under the thumb of his wife, the empress Wei, even appointing his father-in-law prime minister. He also tried to make his father-in-law ''Shizhong'' ({{lang|zh|\u4f8d\u4e2d}}, the head of the examination bureau of government, {{lang|zh|\u9580\u4e0b\u7701}}, ''Menxia Sheng'', and a post considered one for a chancellor) and giving a mid-level office to his [[wet nurse]]'s son\u2014despite stern opposition by the chancellor Pei Yan, at one point remarking to Pei:<ref name=\"ZZTJ203\" />\n\n{{quote|What would be wrong even if I gave the empire to Wei Xuanzhen? Why do you care about ''Shizhong'' so much?}}\n\nPei reported this to Empress Dowager Wu, and she, after planning with Pei, Liu Yizhi, and the generals Cheng Wuting ({{lang|zh|\u7a0b\u52d9\u633a}}) and Zhang Qianxu ({{lang|zh|\u5f35\u8654\u52d6}}), deposed him and replaced him with her youngest son Li Dan, the Prince of Yu (as Emperor Ruizong). Wu Zetian had Zhongzong's father in law, Wei Xuanzhen ({{lang|zh|\u97cb\u7384\u8c9e}}), brought up on charges of treason, and he was sent into seclusion. Emperor Zhongzong was reduced to the title of Prince of Luling and exiled. Empress Dowager Wu also sent the general Qiu Shenji ({{lang|zh|\u4e18\u795e\u52e3}}) to Li Xi\u00e1n's place in exile and forced Li Xi\u00e1n to commit suicide.\n\n===As regent for Emperor Ruizong===\nWu had her youngest son [[Emperor Ruizong of Tang|Li Dan]] made emperor, as Emperor Ruizong. She was the ruler, however, both in substance and appearance. Wu did not even follow the customary pretense of hiding behind a screen or curtain and, in whispers, issued commands for the nominal ruler to formally announce. Ruizong never moved into the imperial quarters, appeared at no imperial function, and remained a virtual prisoner in the inner quarters.<ref>{{harvp|Paludan|1998|pp= 97\u2013101}}</ref>\n\nAlthough Emperor Ruizong held the title of emperor, Empress Dowager Wu firmly controlled the imperial court, and the officials were not allowed to meet with Emperor Ruizong, nor was he allowed to rule on matters of state. Rather, the matters of state were ruled on by Empress Dowager Wu. At the suggestion of her nephew Wu Chengsi, she also expanded the ancestral shrine of the Wu ancestors and gave them greater posthumous honours.<ref name=\"ZZTJ203\" />\n\nIn 686, Empress Dowager Wu offered to return imperial authorities to Emperor Ruizong, but Emperor Ruizong, knowing that she did not truly intend to do so, declined, and she continued to exercise imperial authority.\n\nSoon thereafter, Li Ji's grandson [[Li Jingye]], the Duke of Ying, who had been disaffected by his own exile, started a rebellion at Yang Prefecture ({{lang|zh|\u63da\u5dde}}, roughly modern [[Yangzhou]], [[Jiangsu]]). The rebellion initially drew much popular support in the region, however, Li Jingye progressed slowly in his attack and did not take advantage of that popular support. Meanwhile, Pei suggested to Empress Dowager Wu that she return imperial authority to the Emperor and argued that doing so would cause the rebellion to collapse on its own. This offended her, and she accused him of being complicit with Li Jingye and had him executed; she also demoted, exiled, and killed a number of officials who, when Pei was arrested, tried to speak on his behalf. She sent a general, Li Xiaoyi ({{lang|zh|\u674e\u5b5d\u9038}}), to attack Li Jingye, and while Li Xiaoyi was initially unsuccessful, he pushed on at the urging of his assistant [[Wei Yuanzhong]] and eventually was able to crush Li Jingye's forces. Li Jingye fled and was killed in flight.<ref name=\"ZZTJ203\" />\n\nBy 685, Empress Dowager Wu began to carry on an affair with the [[Buddhist monk]] [[Xue Huaiyi|Huaiyi]] and during the next few years, Huaiyi would be bestowed with progressively greater honours.<ref name=\"ZZTJ203\" /><ref name=\"ZZTJ204\">{{harvp|Zizhi Tongjian|1084|loc= [[:zh:s:\u8cc7\u6cbb\u901a\u9451/\u5377204|vol. 204]]}}</ref><ref name=\"ZZTJ205\">{{harvp|Zizhi Tongjian|1084|loc= [[:zh:s:\u8cc7\u6cbb\u901a\u9451/\u5377205|vol. 205]]}}</ref>\n\nMeanwhile, she installed copper mailboxes outside the imperial government buildings to encourage the people of the realm to report secretly on others, as she suspected many officials of opposing her. Exploiting these beliefs of hers, secret police officials, including [[Suo Yuanli]], [[Zhou Xing (Tang dynasty)|Zhou Xing]], and [[Lai Junchen]], began to rise in power and to carry out systematic false accusations, tortures, and executions of individuals.<ref name=\"ZZTJ203\" />\n\nIn 688, Empress Dowager Wu was set to make sacrifices to the deity of the [[Luo River (Henan)|Luo River]] ({{lang|zh|\u6d1b\u6c34}}, flowing through the Henan province city of [[Luoyang]], then the \"Eastern Capital\"). Wu summoned senior members of Tang's Li imperial clan to Luoyang. The imperial princes worried that she planned to slaughter them and secure the throne for herself: thus, they plotted to resist her. Before a rebellion could be comprehensively planned out, however, Li Zhen and his son [[Li Chong (Tang dynasty)|Li Chong]], the Prince of Langye rose first, at their respective posts as prefects of Yu Prefecture ({{lang|zh|\u8c6b\u5dde}}, roughly modern [[Zhumadian]], [[Henan]]) and Bo Prefecture ({{lang|zh|\u535a\u5dde}}, roughly modern [[Liaocheng]], [[Shandong]]). The other princes were not yet ready, however, and did not rise, and forces sent by Empress Dowager Wu and the local forces crushed Li Chong and Li Zhen's forces quickly. Empress Dowager Wu took this opportunity to arrest Emperor Gaozong's granduncles Li Yuanjia ({{lang|zh|\u674e\u5143\u5609}}) the Prince of Han, Li Lingkui ({{lang|zh|\u674e\u9748\u5914}}) the Prince of Lu, and Princess Changle, as well as many other members of the Li clan and she, forced them to commit suicide. Even Princess Taiping's husband Xue Shao was implicated and starved to death. In the subsequent years, there continued to be many politically motivated massacres of officials and Li clan members.<ref name=\"ZZTJ204\" />\n\nIn 690, Wu took the final step to become the [[empress regnant]] of the newly proclaimed [[Second Zhou dynasty|Zhou dynasty]], and the title ''Huangdi''. Traditional Chinese [[order of succession]] (akin to the [[Salic law]] in Europe) did not allow a woman to ascend the throne, but Wu Zetian was determined to quash the opposition and the use of the secret police did not subside, but continued, after her taking the throne. While her organization of the civil service system was criticized for its laxity of the promotion of officials, nonetheless, Wu Zetian was considered capable of evaluating the performance of the officials once they were in office. The [[Song dynasty]] historian [[Sima Guang]], in his ''[[Zizhi Tongjian]]'', commented:<ref name=\"ZZTJ205\" />\n{{quote|Even though the Empress Dowager{{NoteTag|Throughout the ''Zizhi Tongjian'' descriptions of Wu Zetian's reign, Sima referred to her as \"the Empress Dowager\", implicitly refusing to recognize her as empress regnant, although he used her [[Chinese era name|era name]]s.}} excessively used official titles to cause people to submit to her, if she saw that someone was incompetent, she would immediately depose or even execute him.

She was observant and had good judgment, so the talented people of the time also were willing to be used by her.}}\n\n==Reign as Empress regnant ==\nIn 690, Wu had Emperor Ruizong yield the throne to her and established the Zhou dynasty, with herself as the ruler (''Huangdi'').\n\nThe early part of her reign was characterized by secret police terror, which moderated as the years went by. She was, on the other hand, recognized as a capable and attentive ruler even by traditional historians who despised her, and her ability at selecting capable men to serve as officials was admired throughout the rest of the Tang dynasty as well as in subsequent dynasties.{{NoteTag|See, e.g., {{harvp|Zizhi Tongjian|1084|loc= [[:zh:s:\u8cc7\u6cbb\u901a\u9451/\u5377234|vol. 234]]}} &#91;submission of [[Lu Zhi (Tang dynasty)|Lu Zhi]] to [[Emperor Dezong of Tang]], citing Wu Zetian as the prime example of a capable selector of officials&#93;; [[Zhao Yi]]'s ''[[Notes of the Twenty-Two Histories]]'' ({{lang|zh|\u4e8c\u5341\u4e8c\u53f2\u5284\u8a18}}), ''Empress Wu Accepted Corrections and Knew People''. http://ctwang.myweb.hinet.net/22szj/300/0260.htm.}} (She would be overthrown in a coup in 705 and Emperor Zhongzong returned to the throne, but she would continue to carry the title of \"emperor\" until her death later in that year).\n\n=== Early reign (690-696) ===\n[[File:Epitaph for Yang Shun, general to Empress Wu Zetian, China, Luoyang, Tang dynasty, 693 AD, limestone - Royal Ontario Museum - DSC03576.JPG|thumb|[[Epitaph]] for [[Yang Shun]], general to Empress Wu Zetian, China, [[Luoyang]], 693, limestone, [[Royal Ontario Museum]]]]\n\nShortly after Wu Zetian took the throne, she elevated the status of Buddhism above that of [[Taoism]], officially sanctioning Buddhism by building temples named Dayun Temple ({{lang|zh|\u5927\u96f2\u5bfa}}) in each prefecture belonging to the capital regions of the two capitals Luoyang and Chang'an, and created nine senior monks as dukes. She also enshrined seven generations of Wu ancestors at the imperial ancestral temple, although she also continued to offer sacrifices to the Tang emperors Gaozu, Taizong, and Gaozong.<ref name=\"ZZTJ204\" />\n\nShe faced the issue of succession. At the time she took the throne, she created Li Dan, the former Emperor Ruizong, crown prince, and bestowed the name of Wu on him.<ref name=\"ZZTJ204\" /> The official [[Zhang Jiafu]], however, convinced the commoner Wang Qingzhi ({{lang|zh|\u738b\u6176\u4e4b}}) to start a petition drive to make her nephew Wu Chengsi crown prince, arguing that an emperor named Wu should pass the throne to a member of the Wu clan. Wu Zetian was tempted to do so, and when the chancellors [[Cen Changqian]] and [[Ge Fuyuan]] opposed sternly, they, along with fellow chancellor [[Ouyang Tong]], were executed. Nevertheless, she declined Wang's request to make Wu Chengsi crown prince, but for a time allowed Wang to freely enter the palace to see her. On one occasion, however, when Wang angered her by coming to the palace too much, she asked the official [[Li Zhaode]] to batter Wang as punishment\u2014but Li Zhaode exploited the opportunity to batter Wang to death, and his group of petitioners scattered. Li Zhaode then persuaded Wu Zetian to keep Li Dan as crown prince\u2014pointing out that a son was closer in relations than a nephew, and also that if Wu Chengsi became emperor, Emperor Gaozong would never again be worshiped. Wu Zetian agreed, and for some time did not reconsider the matter.<ref name=\"ZZTJ204\" /> Further, at Li Zhaode's warning that Wu Chengsi was becoming too powerful, Wu Zetian stripped Wu Chengsi of his chancellor authority and bestowed on him largely honorific titles without authority.<ref name=\"ZZTJ205\" />\n\nMeanwhile, the power of the secret police officials continued to increase, until they appeared to be curbed starting in about 692, when Lai Junchen was foiled in his attempt to have the chancellors [[Ren Zhigu]], [[Di Renjie]], [[Pei Xingben]], and other officials Cui Xuanli ({{lang|zh|\u5d14\u5ba3\u79ae}}), Lu Xian ({{lang|zh|\u76e7\u737b}}), Wei Yuanzhong, and Li Sizhen ({{lang|zh|\u674e\u55e3\u771e}}) executed, as Di, under arrest, had hidden a secret petition inside a change of clothes and had it submitted by his son Di Guangyuan ({{lang|zh|\u72c4\u5149\u9060}}). The seven still were exiled, but after this incident, particularly at the urging of Li Zhaode, [[Zhu Jingze]], and Zhou Ju ({{lang|zh|\u5468\u77e9}}), the waves of politically motivated massacres decreased, although they did not end entirely.<ref name=\"ZZTJ205\" />\n\nAlso in 692, Wu Zetian commissioned the general [[Wang Xiaojie]] to attack the [[Tibetan Empire]], and Wang recaptured the four garrisons of the [[Western Regions]] that had fallen to the Tibetan Empire in 670 \u2013 [[Kucha]], [[Yutian County, Xinjiang|Yutian]], [[Kashgar]], and [[Suyab]].<ref name=\"ZZTJ205\" />\n\nIn 693, after Wu Zetian's trusted [[lady-in-waiting]] Wei Tuan'er ({{lang|zh|\u97cb\u5718\u5152}}), who hated Li Dan (the reason why she did so is lost to history), falsely accused Li Dan's wife [[Empress Liu (Tang dynasty)|Crown Princess Liu]] and Consort Dou of using witchcraft, Wu Zetian had Crown Princess Liu and Consort Dou killed. Li Dan, fearful that he was to be next, did not dare to speak of them. When Wei further planned to falsely accuse Li Dan, however, someone else informed on her, and she was executed. Wu Zetian nevertheless had Li Dan's sons demoted in their princely titles, and when the officials Pei Feigong ({{lang|zh|\u88f4\u532a\u8eac}}) and Fan Yunxian ({{lang|zh|\u8303\u96f2\u4ed9}}) were accused of secretly meeting Li Dan, she executed Pei and Fan and further, barred officials from meeting Li Dan. There were then accusations that Li Dan was plotting treason, and under Wu Zetian's direction, Lai launched an investigation. Lai arrested Li Dan's servants and tortured them\u2014and the torture was such that many of them were ready to falsely implicate themselves and Li Dan. One of Li Dan's servants, [[An Jincang]], however, proclaimed Li Dan's innocence and cut his own belly open to swear to that fact. When Wu Zetian heard of what An did, she had doctors attend to An and barely save his life, and then ordered Lai to end the investigation, thus saving Li Dan.<ref name=\"ZZTJ205\" />\n\nIn 694, Li Zhaode, who had become powerful after Wu Chengsi's removal, was thought to be too powerful and Wu Zetian removed him.<ref name=\"ZZTJ205\" /> Also around this time, she became highly impressed with a group of mystic individuals\u2014the hermit [[Wei Shifang]] (on whom she bestowed a chancellor title briefly), who claimed to be more than 350&nbsp;years old; an old [[bhikkhuni|Buddhist nun]] who claimed to be a [[buddhahood|Buddha]] and capable of predicting the future; and a non-[[Han Chinese|Han]] man who claimed to be 500&nbsp;years old. During this time, Wu briefly claimed to be and adopted the cult imagery of [[Maitreya]] in order to build popular support for her reign.<ref name=\"domesticatingdharma\">{{cite book |last = McBride |first=Richard D. |authorlink = Richard D.

Subsequently, she also put Huaiyi to death. After this incident, she appeared to pay less attention to mysticism and became even more dedicated than before to the affairs of state.<ref name=\"ZZTJ205\" />\n\n=== Middle reign (696-701) ===\n[[File:Xian 2006 5-1.jpg|thumb|upright|The [[Giant Wild Goose Pagoda]], originally built in 652, it collapsed and was rebuilt in 701\u2013704 during the reign of Wu Zetian; the present structure is largely the same as it was in the 8th century, although it used to be three stories taller before the damage caused by the [[1556 Shaanxi earthquake]]]]\n\nWu Zetian's administration was soon in for various troubles on the western and then northern borders, however. In spring 696, an army she sent, commanded by Wang Xiaojie and [[Lou Shide]] against the Tibetan Empire, was soundly defeated by Tibetan generals, the brothers [[Gar Trinring Tsendro]] ({{lang|zh|\u8ad6\u6b3d\u9675 }}) and [[Gar Tsenba]] ({{lang|zh| \u8ad6\u8d0a\u5a46 }}), and as a result, she demoted Wang to commoner rank and Lou to be a low level prefectural official, although she eventually restored both of them to general positions.<ref name=\"ZZTJ205\" /> In April of the same year, Wu Zetian recast the [[Nine Tripod Cauldrons]], the symbol of ultimate power in ancient China, to reinforce her authority.<ref name=\"ZZTJ208\" />\n\nA much more serious threat arose in summer 696. The [[Khitan people|Khitan]] chieftains [[Li Jinzhong]] and [[Sun Wanrong]], brothers-in-law, angry over the mistreatment of the Khitan people by the Zhou official Zhao Wenhui ({{lang|zh|\u8d99\u6587\u7ffd}}), the prefect of Ying Prefecture ({{lang|zh|\u71df\u5dde }}, roughly [[Zhaoyang County]], [[Liaoning]]), rebelled, with Li assuming the title of Wushang Khan (\u7121\u4e0a\u53ef\u6c57). Armies that Wu Zetian sent to suppress Li and Sun's rebellion were defeated by Khitan forces, which in turn attacked Zhou proper. Meanwhile, [[Qapaghan Qaghan]] of the [[Second Turkic Khaganate]] offered to submit, and yet was also launching attacks against Zhou and Khitan\u2014including an attack against Khitan base of operations during the winter of 696, shortly after Li's death, that captured Li's and Sun's families and temporarily halted Khitan operations against Zhou.<ref name=\"ZZTJ205\" /> Sun, after taking over as khan and reorganizing Khitan forces, again attacked Zhou territory and had many victories over Zhou forces, including a battle during which Wang Shijie was killed.<ref name=\"ZZTJ206\">{{harvp|Zizhi Tongjian|1084|loc= [[:zh:s:\u8cc7\u6cbb\u901a\u9451/\u5377206|vol. 206]]}}</ref><ref name=\"ZZTJ205\" /> Wu Zetian tried to allay the situation by making peace with Ashina Mochuo at fairly costly terms\u2014the return of Tujue people who had previously submitted to Zhou and providing Ashina Mochuo with seeds, silk, tools, and iron. In summer 697, Ashina Mochuo launched another attack on Khitan's base of operations, and this time, after his attack, Khitan forces collapsed and Sun was killed in flight, ending the Khitan threat.<ref name=\"ZZTJ206\" />\n\nMeanwhile, also in 697, Lai Junchen, who had at one point lost power but then had returned to power, falsely accused Li Zhaode (who had been pardoned) of crimes, and then planned to falsely accuse Li Dan, Li Zhe, the Wu clan princes, and Princess Taiping, of treason. The Wu clan princes and Princess Taiping acted first against him, accusing him of crimes, and he and Li Zhaode were executed together. After Lai's death, the reign of the secret police largely ended. Gradually, many of the victims of Lai and the other secret police officials were exonerated posthumously.<ref name=\"ZZTJ206\" /> Meanwhile, around this time, Wu Zetian began relationships with two new lovers\u2014the brothers [[Zhang Yizhi and Zhang Changzong]], who became honored within the palace and were eventually created dukes.<ref name=\"ZZTJ206\" /><ref name=\"ZZTJ207\">{{harvp|Zizhi Tongjian|1084|loc= [[:zh:s:\u8cc7\u6cbb\u901a\u9451/\u5377207|vol. 207]]}}</ref>\n\nAround 698, Wu Chengsi and another nephew of Wu Zetian's, [[Wu Sansi]], the Prince of Liang, were repeatedly making attempts to have officials persuade Wu Zetian to create one of them crown prince\u2014again citing the reason that an emperor should pass the throne to someone of the same clan. Di Renjie, who by now had become a trusted chancellor, was firmly against the idea, however, and proposed that Li Zhe be recalled instead. He was supported in this by fellow chancellors [[Wang Fangqing]] and [[Wang Jishan]], as well as Wu Zetian's close advisor [[Ji Xu]], who further persuaded the Zhang brothers to support the idea as well. In spring 698, Wu Zetian agreed and recalled Li Zhe from exile. Soon, Li Dan offered to yield the crown prince position to Li Zhe, and Wu Zetian created Li Zhe crown prince. She soon changed his name back to Li Xi\u01cen and then Wu Xian.<ref name=\"ZZTJ206\" />\n\nLater, Ashina Mochuo demanded a [[Tang dynasty]] prince for marriage to his daughter, part of a plot to join his family with the Tang, displace the Zhou, and restore Tang rule over China (under his influence). When Wu Zetian sent a member of her own family, grandnephew Wu Yanxiu ({{lang|zh|\u6b66\u5ef6\u79c0}}), to marry Mochuo's daughter instead, he rejected him.<ref>{{Cite book\n |title = A history of China\n |author = Jonathan Wolfram Eberhard\n |year = 1997\n |publisher = University of California Press\n |page = 186\n |url = https://books.google.com/books?id=mUofeN6WW_IC&pg=PA186&dq=kao+tsung+demanded+chinese+prince+daughter&hl=en&ei=LWhMTOTUDoL58AaKzeU2&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=1&ved=0CCsQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&q=kao%20tsung%20demanded%20chinese%20prince%20daughter&f=false\n |access-date = 2010-06-28\n |ISBN = 978-0-520-03268-2\n}}</ref> Ashina Mochuo had no intention to cement the peace treaty with a marriage; instead, when Wu Yanxiu arrived, he detained Wu Yanxiu and then launched a major attack on Zhou, advancing as far south as Zhao Prefecture ({{lang|zh|\u8d99\u5dde}}, in modern [[Shijiazhuang]], [[Hebei]]) before withdrawing.<ref name=\"ZZTJ206\" />\n\nIn 699, however, at least the Tibetan threat would cease. Emperor [[Tridu Songtsen]], unhappy that Gar Trinring was monopolizing power, took an opportunity when Trinring was away from the capital [[Lhasa]] to slaughter Trinring's associates. He then defeated Trinring in battle, and Trinring committed suicide. Gar Tsenba and Trinring's son, [[Lun Gongren]] ({{lang|zh|\u8ad6\u5f13\u4ec1}}), surrendered to Zhou. After this, the Tibetan Empire was under internal turmoil for several years, and there was peace for Zhou on the border.<ref name=\"ZZTJ206\" />\n\nAlso in 699, Wu Zetian, realizing that she was growing old, feared that after her death, Li Xian and the Wu clan princes would not be able to have peace with each other, and she made him, Li Dan, Princess Taiping, Princess Taiping's second husband [[Wu Youji]] (a nephew of hers), the Prince of Ding, and other Wu clan princes to swear an oath to each other.<ref name=\"ZZTJ206\" />\n\n=== Late reign (701-705) ===\n[[File:Tang Dynasty circa 700 CE.png|thumb|Estimated territorial extent of Wu Zetian's empire]]\n\nAs Wu Zetian grew older, Zhang Yizhi and Zhang Changzong became increasingly powerful, and even the princes of the Wu clan flattered them. She also increasingly relied on them to handle the affairs of state. This was secretly discussed and criticized by her grandson [[Li Chongrun]], the Prince of Shao, (Li Xian's son), granddaughter [[Li Xianhui]] ({{lang|zh|\u674e\u4ed9\u8559}}) the Lady Yongtai (Li Chongrun's sister), and Li Xianhui's husband Wu Yanji ({{lang|zh|\u6b66\u5ef6\u57fa}}) the Prince of Wei (Wu Zetian's grandnephew and Wu Chengsi's son), but somehow the discussion was leaked, and Zhang Yizhi reported this to Wu Zetian. She ordered the three of them to commit suicide.{{NoteTag|The ''Zizhi Tongjian'' asserted that Li Chongrun was forced to commit suicide, but the ''[[Old Book of Tang]]'' and the ''[[New Book of Tang]]'' asserted in his biographies that he was caned to death on Wu Zetian's orders.

The ''Old Book of Tang'', meanwhile, inconsistently asserted in the chronicles of Wu Zetian's reign that he was forced to commit suicide. {{harv|Old Book of Tang||loc=[[:zh:s:\u820a\u5510\u66f8/\u53776|vol. 6]]}} The chronicles of Wu Zetian's reign in the ''New Book of Tang'' merely stated that the three of them \"were killed\". {{harv|New Book of Tang||loc=[[:zh:s:\u65b0\u5510\u66f8/\u5377004|vol. 4]]}}.}}{{NoteTag|However, some modern historians, based on the text on Li Xianhui's tombstone (written after Emperor Zhongzong was restored to the throne in 705), which suggested that she died the day after her brother and her husband and that she was pregnant at death, and the fact that the skeleton believed to be hers had a small pelvis, have proposed the theory that she was not ordered to commit suicide, but had, in grief over her brother's and husband's deaths, had either a miscarriage or a difficult birth and died from that.

Individuals she promoted in her old age included, among others, [[Cui Xuanwei]] and [[Zhang Jiazhen]].<ref name=\"ZZTJ207\" />\n\nBy 703, Zhang Yizhi and Zhang Changzong had become resentful of Wei Yuanzhong, who by now was a senior chancellor, for dressing down their brother Zhang Changyi ({{lang|zh|\u5f35\u660c\u5100}}) and rejecting the promotion of another brother Zhang Changqi ({{lang|zh|\u5f35\u660c\u671f}}). They also were fearful that if Wu Zetian died, Wei would find a way to execute them, and therefore accused Wei and Gao Jian ({{lang|zh|\u9ad8\u6229}}), an official favoured by Princess Taiping, of speculating on Wu Zetian's old age and death. They initially got Wei's subordinate [[Zhang Yue (Tang dynasty)|Zhang Shuo]] to agree to corroborate the charges, but once Zhang Shuo was before Wu Zetian, he instead accused Zhang Yizhi and Zhang Changzong of forcing him to bear false witness. As a result, Wei, Gao, and Zhang Shuo were exiled, but escaped death.<ref name=\"ZZTJ207\" />\n\n== Removal and death ==\n[[File:Qianling.jpg|thumb|upright|Located to the east of Phoenix Gate within the [[Qianling Mausoleum]]\u2013built near [[Chang'an]] in 706 to house the remains of [[Tang Gaozong]], Empress Wu, and other royal members of the Chinese [[Tang Dynasty]]\u2013is the large Blank Tablet or Wordless Stele. This tablet is 6.3 meters tall and weighs 98 tonnes. Although no written inscriptions adorn this edifice (hence its name), the sides of the tablet feature carved dragons while the top features carved oysters.]]\n\nIn autumn of 704, there began to be accusations of corruption levied against Zhang Yizhi and Zhang Changzong, as well as their brothers Zhang Changqi, Zhang Changyi, and Zhang Tongxiu ({{lang|zh|\u5f35\u540c\u4f11}}). Zhang Tongxiu and Zhang Changyi were demoted, but even though the officials Li Chengjia ({{lang|zh|\u674e\u627f\u5609}}) and [[Huan Yanfan]] advocated that Zhang Yizhi and Zhang Changzong be removed as well, Wu Zetian, taking the suggestion of the chancellor [[Yang Zaisi]], did not remove them. Subsequently, charges of corruption against Zhang Yizhi and Zhang Changzong were renewed by the chancellor [[Wei Anshi]].<ref name=\"ZZTJ207\" />\n[[File:Qianling Mausoleum 38 2013-08.JPG|thumb|left|upright|Side view of the Blank Tablet.]]\n\nIn winter 704, Wu Zetian became seriously ill for a period, and only the Zhang brothers were allowed to see her; the chancellors were not. This led to speculation that Zhang Yizhi and Zhang Changzong were plotting to take over the throne, and there were repeated accusations of treason. Once her condition improved, Cui Xuanwei advocated that only Li Xian and Li Dan be allowed to attend to her\u2014a suggestion that she did not accept. After further accusations against the Zhang brothers by Huan and [[Song Jing]], Wu Zetian allowed Song to investigate, but before the investigation was completed, she issued a pardon for Zhang Yizhi, derailing Song's investigation.<ref name=\"ZZTJ207\" />\n\nBy spring 705, Wu Zetian was seriously ill again. [[Zhang Jianzhi]], [[Jing Hui]], and [[Yuan Shuji]], planned a coup to kill the Zhang brothers. They convinced the generals [[Li Duozuo]], Li Dan ({{lang|zh|\u674e\u6e5b}}, note different character than the [[Emperor Ruizong of Tang|former emperor]]), and Yang Yuanyan ({{lang|zh|\u694a\u5143\u7430}}) and another chancellor, [[Yao Chong|Yao Yuanzhi]], to be involved. With agreement from Li Xian as well, they acted on 20 February,{{cn |date=September 2019}} killing [[Zhang Yizhi]] and [[Zhang Changzong]], and then they had Changsheng Hall ({{lang|zh|\u9577\u751f\u6bbf}}), where Wu Zetian was residing, surrounded. They then reported to her that the Zhang brothers had been executed for treason, and they then forced her to yield the throne to Li Xian. On 21 February, an edict was issued in her name that made Li Xian regent, and on 22 February, an edict was issued in her name passing the throne to Li Xian. On 23 February, Li Xian formally retook the throne, and the next day, Wu Zetian, under heavy guard, was moved to the subsidiary palace, Shangyang Palace ({{lang|zh|\u4e0a\u967d\u5bae}}), but was nevertheless honoured with the title of Empress Regnant Zetian Dasheng ({{lang|zh|\u5247\u5929\u5927\u8056\u7687\u5e1d}}).<ref name=\"ZZTJ207\" /> On 3 March,{{cn |date=September 2019}} Tang dynasty was restored, ending the Zhou.<ref name=\"ZZTJ208\">{{harvp|Zizhi Tongjian|1084|loc= [[:zh:s:\u8cc7\u6cbb\u901a\u9451/\u5377208|vol. 208]]}}.</ref>\n\nShe died on 16 December,{{cn |date=September 2019}} and, pursuant to a final edict issued in her name, was no longer referred to as empress regnant, but instead as Empress Consort Zetian Dasheng ({{lang|zh|\u5247\u5929\u5927\u8056\u7687\u540e}}).<ref name=\"ZZTJ208\" /> In 706, Wu Zetian's son [[Emperor Zhongzong of Tang|Emperor Zhongzong]] had Wu Zetian interred in a joint burial with his father [[Emperor Gaozong of Tang|Emperor Gaozong]] at the [[Qianling Mausoleum]], located near the capital [[Chang'an]] on Mount Liang. Emperor Zhongzong also buried at Qianling his brother [[Li Xian (prince)|Li Xi\u00e1n]], son [[Li Chongrun]], and daughter Li Xianhui ({{lang|zh|\u674e\u4ed9\u8559}}) the Lady Yongtai (posthumously honoured as the Princess Yongtai)\u2014victims of Wu Zetian's wrath.\n\n== Zhou dynasty ==\n{{main|Zhou dynasty (690\u2013705)}}\n\nWu Zetian proclaimed herself as the ruler of the \"[[Zhou dynasty (690\u2013705)|Zhou dynasty]]\", named after the historical [[Zhou dynasty]] (1046\u2013256 BC); and, thus, from 690 to 705 the Chinese Empire was known as the Zhou dynasty. The traditional historical view, however, is to discount Wu's \"Zhou dynasty\": dynasties by definition involve the succession of rulers from one family: Wu's \"Zhou dynasty\" was founded by her, and ended within her lifetime, with her abdication (705). This does not meet the traditional concept of a dynasty. The alternative, is to view Wu's \"Zhou dynasty\" as the revival of the generally historically-accepted historical Zhou dynasty, which had been ruled (at least nominally) by the [[Ji (surname)|Ji]] family, almost a thousand years before. Either way, Wu's Zhou dynasty is best viewed as a brief interruption of the Li family's Tang dynasty, rather than as a fully realized dynasty. Her claim of founding a new dynasty, however, was little opposed at the time (690).<ref>{{harvp|Paludan|1998|p= 101}}</ref> The fifteen-year period which Wu Zetian designated as her \"Zhou Dynasty\" considered in the context of nearly a half century of ''de facto'' rule (c. 654\u2013705) reveals a remarkable and still debated period of history.<ref>{{harvp|Fairbank|1992|pp= 81\u201382}}</ref> In this context, designating a new dynasty, with her as its emperor can be seen as part of her power politics, and as the culmination of her period of ruling. Though the fifteen years of Wu Zetian's Zhou dynasty had its own notable characteristics, these are difficult to separate from Wu's reign of power, which lasted for about half of a century.\n\nWu Zetian's consolidation of power in part relied on a system of spies. She used informants to choose persons to eliminate, a process which peaked in 697, with the wholesale demotion, exile, or killing of various aristocratic families and scholars, furthermore prohibiting their sons from holding office.<ref name=\"Paludan, 99\">{{harvp|Paludan|1998|p= 99}}</ref>\n\nOne apparatus of government which fell into Wu's power was the [[imperial examination]] system: the basic theory and practice of which was to recruit into government service those men who were the best educated, talented, and having the best potential to perform their duties, and to do so by testing a pool of candidates in order to determine this objectively. This pool was male only, and the qualified pool of candidates and resulting placements into official positions was on a relatively small scale at the time of Wu's assuming control of government. The official tests examined such things considered important for functionaries of the highly developed, bureaucratic government structure of the current imperial government. The qualities sought in a candidate for government service included determining the potential official's level of literacy in terms of reading and writing as well as his possession of the specific knowledge considered necessary and desirable for a governmental official, such as [[Confucianism|Confucian]] precepts on the nature of virtue and theory on the proper ordering of and relationships within society. Wu Zetian continued to use the imperial examination system to recruit civil servants, and she introduced major changes in regard to the system that she inherited, including increasing the pool of candidates permitted to take the test, by allowing commoners and gentry, who were previously disqualified by their background, to take them. Another thing she did was to expand the governmental examination system and to greatly increase the importance of this method of recruiting government officials, which she did in 693.<ref name=\"Paludan, 97\" /> Wu provided increased opportunity for the representation within government to people of the [[North China Plain]], versus people of the northwestern aristocratic families, (whom she decimated, anyway); and, the successful candidates who were recruited through the examination system became an elite group within her government.<ref name=\"Fairbank, 82\">{{harvp|Fairbank|1992|p= 82}}</ref> The historical details surrounding and the consequences of Wu Zetian's promoting a new group of people from previously disenfranchised backgrounds into prominence as powerful governmental officials as well as the role of the examination system in this regard, remains a matter of debate for scholars of this subject.\n\nWu Zetian eliminated many of her real, potential, or perceived rivals to power by means of death (including execution, suicide by command, and more-or-less directly killing people), demotion, and exile. Mostly this was carried out by her secret police, led by individuals like Wao Ganjun and [[Lai Junchen]]\u2014who were known to have written a document called the ''Manual of Accusation'', which detailed steps for interrogation and obtaining confessions by torture. One of these methods, the \"Dying Swine's Melancholy\" ({{lang|zh|\u6b7b\u732a\u6101}}),<ref>http://baike.baidu.com/view/159862.htm</ref>{{better source|date=August 2017}} which merely indicated a level of pain inflicted by a torture device, seems to have been conflated in the years following Wu's death with the story of the \"human swine\" torture conducted by [[Empress L\u00fc Zhi]], in which the victim had limbs and tongue amputated, was force-fed, and left to wallow in his own excrement.\n\nWu targeted various individuals, including many in her own family and her extended family. In reaction to an attempt to remove her from power, in 684, she massacred twelve entire collateral branches of the imperial family.<ref name=\"Paludan, 99\" /> Besides this, she also altered the ancient balance of power in China, dating back to the [[Qin dynasty]]. The old area of the [[Qin (state)|Qin state]] was later referred to as [[Guanzhong]], literally, the area \"within the fortified mountain passes\". It was from this area of northwest China that the Ying family of Qin arose to conquer, unifying China into its first historical empire. During the [[Han dynasty]], [[Sima Qian]] records in his ''[[Records of the Grand Historian|Shiji]]'' that Guanzhong had three-tenths of China's population, but six-tenths of its wealth.<ref>{{harvp|Cotterell|Cotterell|1975|p= 90}}</ref> Additionally, at the beginning of Wu Zetian's period of ascendency, Guanzhong was still the stronghold of the most nationally powerful aristocratic families, despite the fact that economic development in other parts of China had improved the lot of families in other regions. The Guangzhong aristocracy was not willing to relinquish their hold on the reins of government, however; while, at the same time, some of the more newly wealthy families in other areas, such as the [[North China Plain]] or [[Hubei]] were eager for a larger share of national power of their own. Most of the opposition to Wu was from the Guangzhong families of northwest China. Accordingly, she repressed them, instead favoring less privileged families, thus raising to the ranks of power many talented, but less aristocratic families, often recruited through the official examination system.<ref name=\"Cotterell and Cotterell, 144\">{{harvp|Cotterell|Cotterell|1975|p= 144}}</ref> Many of those so favored originated from the North China plain.<ref>{{harvp|Fairbank|1992|p= 81}}</ref> Through a process of eliminating or diminishing the power of the established aristocracy, whom she perceived as disloyal to her, and establishing a reformed upper class in China loyal to her, Wu Zetian made major social changes which are still being evaluated by historians.\n\n[[File:Maitreya-Tang Dynasty-side.JPG|thumb|left|upright|[[Maitreya]] statue from the reign of Wu Zetian]]\n\nWu Zetian used her power to increase or to attempt to increase her power by manipulating Buddhist, [[Daoist]], and Confucianist practice, sometimes in reference to the idea of the [[Mandate of Heaven]]. There are also allegations of witchcraft or sorcery. Wu began to manipulate the symbolic aspects of religious and imperial power long before she became ''huangdi'', one case being the Sacrifice on Mount Tai, in 666. When Emperor Gaozong offered sacrifices to the deities of heaven and earth at [[Mount Tai]], Empress Wu, in an unprecedented action, offered sacrifices after him, with Princess Dowager Yan, mother of Emperor Gaozong's brother [[Li Zhen (Tang dynasty)|Li Zhen]], Prince of Yue, offering sacrifices after her.<ref name=ZZTJ201 /> Wu Zetian's procession of ladies up Mount Tai conspicuously linked Wu with the most sacred traditional rites of the Chinese empire.<ref name=\"Paludan, 99\" />\n\nMany of Wu Zetian's measures were of a popular nature, and helped her to gain support for her rule. Wu Zetian came to power during a time in China in which the people were fairly contented, the administration was run well, and the economy was characterized by rising living standards.<ref name=\"Paludan, 96\" /> Wu Zetian, as far as the masses were for the most part concerned, continued in this manner. She was determined that free, self-sufficient farmers would continue to work on their own farm land, so she periodically used the [[Equal-field system|''juntian'', equal-field system]], together with updated census figures to ensure fair land allocations, re-allocating as necessary.<ref name=\"Fairbank, 82\" /> Much of her success was due to her various edicts (including those known as her \"Acts of Grace\") which helped to satisfy the needs of the lower classes through various acts of relief, her widening recruitment to government service to include previously excluded gentry and commoners, and by her generous promotions and pay raises for the lower ranks.<ref name=\"Paludan, 100\" />\n\nWu Zetian used her military and diplomatic skills to enhance her position. The [[Fubing system|''fubing'' system]] of self-supportive soldier-farmer colonies, which provided local militia and labor services for her government, allowed her to maintain her armed forces at reduced expense.<ref name=\"Fairbank, 82\" /> She also pursued a policy of military action to expand the empire to its furthest extent ever up to that point in Central Asia. Expansion efforts against [[Tibet]] and to the northwest were less successful. Allying with the Korean kingdom of Silla [[Goguryeo\u2013Tang War|against Goguryeo]] with the promise of ceding Goguryeo's territory to Silla, Chinese forces [[Silla-Tang War|occupied Goguryeo]] after its defeat, and even began to occupy Silla territory. Silla resisted the imposition of Chinese rule, and by allying with Goguryeo and Baekche, was able to expel its former ally from the peninsula. Hong argues that Silla's success was in part due to a shift in Empress Wu's focus to Tibet and inadequate support for the forces in the Korean peninsula.{{sfn|Hong|2007|244\u201345}} Despite victories against Tibetans and Turks:<ref>{{harvp|Paludan|1998|pp=96\u201397}}</ref> however, in 694, Wu's forces decisively defeated the Tibetan\u2013Western Turk alliance, and retook the [[Four Garrisons of Anxi]], lost in 668.<ref>{{harvp|Beckwith|2009|pp=130\u2013131}}</ref>\n\nAnother significant event of Wu Zetian's reign was 651, shortly after the [[Muslim conquest of Persia]], when the first Arab ambassador arrived in China.<ref name=\"Paludan, 96\" />\n\n== Literature ==\n=== North Gate Scholars ===\nToward the end of Gaozong's life, Wu began engaging a number of mid-level officials who had literary talent, including Yuan Wanqing ({{lang|zh|\u5143\u842c\u9803}}), [[Liu Yizhi]], [[Fan L\u00fcbing]], Miao Chuke ({{lang|zh|\u82d7\u695a\u5ba2}}), Zhou Simao ({{lang|zh|\u5468\u601d\u8302}}), and Han Chubin ({{lang|zh|\u97d3\u695a\u8cd3}}), to write a number of works on her behalf, including the ''Biographies of Notable Women'' ({{lang|zh|\u5217\u5973\u50b3}}), ''Guidelines for Imperial Subjects'' ({{lang|zh|\u81e3\u8ecc}}), and ''New Teachings for Official Staff Members'' ({{lang|zh|\u767e\u50da\u65b0\u8aa1}}). Collectively, they became known as the \"North Gate Scholars\" ({{lang|zh|\u5317\u9580\u5b78\u58eb}}), because they served inside the palace, which was to the north of the imperial government buildings, and Empress Wu sought advice from them to divert the powers of the chancellors.<ref name=\"ZZTJ202\" />\n\n=== The \"Twelve Suggestions\" ===\nAround the new year 675, Empress Wu submitted twelve suggestions. One was that the work of [[Laozi]] (whose family name was Li and to whom the Tang imperial clan traced its ancestry), [[Tao Te Ching]], should be added to the required reading for imperial university students. Another was that a three-year mourning period should be observed for a mother's death in all cases, not only in those cases when the father was no longer alive. Emperor Gaozong praised her for her suggestions and adopted them.<ref name=\"ZZTJ202\" />\n\n=== Modified Chinese characters ===\n[[File:\u5219\u5929\u6587\u5b57\u4e4b\u7167\u4e00.SVG|thumb|right|50px|First version of modified character of \"Zhao\"]]\n[[File:\u5219\u5929\u6587\u5b57\u4e4b\u7167\u4e8c.SVG|thumb|right|50px|Second version of modified character of \"Zhao\"]]\n\n[[File:\u5347\u4ed9\u592a\u5b50\u7891\u62d3\u7247\u5c40\u90e8.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Text from Wu Zetian-era stele dedicated to Ji Jin ({{lang|zh|\u59ec\u6649}}), the [[crown prince]] of [[King Ling of Zhou]], recorded in legends as having risen to heaven to become a god; under the cosmology of Wu Zetian's reign, her lover [[Zhang Changzong]] was a reincarnation of Ji Jin; the text of the stele uses [[Chinese characters of Empress Wu|modified Chinese characters]] that she promulgated]]\n\nIn 690, Empress Dowager Wu's cousin's son [[Zong Qinke]] submitted a number of [[Chinese characters of Empress Wu|modified Chinese characters]] intended to showcase Empress Dowager Wu's greatness. She adopted them, and she took one of the modified characters, Zhao ({{lang|zh|\u66cc}}), to be her formal name (i.e., the name by which the people would exercise [[naming taboo]] on). {{lang|zh|\u66cc}} was made from two other characters: Ming ({{lang|zh|\u660e}}) on top, meaning \"light\" or \"clarity\", and Kong ({{lang|zh|\u7a7a}}) on the bottom, meaning \"sky.\" The implication appeared to be that she would be like the light shining from the sky. (Zhao ({{lang|zh|\u7167}}), meaning \"shine\", from which {{lang|zh|\u66cc}} was derived, might have been her original name, but evidence of that is inconclusive.){{NoteTag|Her cousin's son [[Zong Qinke]] created a number of new characters in December 689, and she chose {{lang|zh|\u66cc}} as her given name, which became her [[Naming taboo|taboo name]] when she ascended the throne the next year. Some sources assert that this character was actually written {{lang|zh|\u77be}}. Some sources (e.g., ''[[Bo Yang]] Edition of the Zizhi Tongjian'', vols. 47\u201349) also assert that her original given name was Zhao and that in 689 she only changed the written character, but this is confirmed by neither the ''Old Book of Tang'' nor the ''New Book of Tang'', neither of which stated her original given name. Her grandson [[Li Chongrun|Li Chongzhao]], sometime after she became emperor, changed his name to Li Chongrun to observe naming taboo for her, and the character of \"Zhao\" in Li Chongzhao's name was {{lang|zh|\u7167}}.

On 18 August 690,{{cn |date=September 2019}} she approved of the requests. She changed the name of the state to Zhou, claiming ancestry from the [[Zhou dynasty]], and took the throne as Empress Regnant (with the title of Empress Regnant Shengshen ({{lang|zh|\u8056\u795e\u7687\u5e1d}}), literally \"Divine and Sacred Emperor or Empress Regnant\"). Emperor Ruizong was deposed and made crown prince with the atypical title of ''Huangsi'' ({{lang|zh|\u7687\u55e3}}).<ref name=\"ZZTJ204\" /> This thus interrupted the Tang dynasty, and she became the first (and only) woman to reign over China as Empress Regnant.{{NoteTag|During Emperor Taizong's reign, a female agrarian rebel leader named [[Chen Shuozhen]] ({{lang|zh|\u9673\u78a9\u771e}}) had declared herself \"emperor\" with the title Emperor Wenjia ({{lang|zh|\u6587\u4f73\u7687\u5e1d}}), but as Chen was quickly defeated and killed, she is typically not considered a true \"emperor\". See {{harvp|Zizhi Tongjian|1084|loc= [[:zh:s:\u8cc7\u6cbb\u901a\u9451/\u5377199|vol. 199]]}}. Earlier than that, during [[Northern Wei dynasty]], [[Empress Dowager Hu (Northern Wei)|Empress Dowager Hu]], after her son [[Emperor Xiaoming of Northern Wei|Emperor Xiaoming]]'s death, falsely declared [[Daughter of Emperor Xiaoming of Northern Wei|Emperor Xiaoming's daughter]] to be a son and declared the daughter to be the new emperor, but almost immediately revealed that the child was in fact female, and thereafter declared [[Yuan Zhao]], the young son of Emperor Xiaoming's cousin Yuan Baohui ({{lang|zh|\u5143\u5bf6\u6689}}) emperor. See {{harvp|Zizhi Tongjian|1084|loc= [[:zh:s:\u8cc7\u6cbb\u901a\u9451/\u5377152|vol. 152]]}}. Emperor Xiaoming's daughter is also therefore not usually considered a true emperor.}}\n\n=== Poetry ===\nBeside her own literary work, Wu Zetian's court was a focus of literary creativity. Forty-six of Wu's poems are collected in the ''[[Quan Tangshi]]'' \"Collected Tang Poems\" and sixty-one essays under her name are recorded in the ''Quan Tangwen'' \"Collected Tang Essays\".<ref>{{Cite book |title = Women writers of traditional China: an anthology of poetry and criticism\n |authors = [[Kang-i Sun Chang]], [[Haun Saussy]], Charles Yim-tze Kwong\n |year = 1999\n |publisher = Stanford University Press\n |page = 31\n}}</ref> Although a lot of those writings serve political ends, there is one poem in which she laments her mother after she died and expresses her despair at not being able to see her again.\n\nDuring Wu Zetian's reign, the imperial court produced various works for which she was a sponsor, such as the anthology of the poetry of her court known as the ''[[Zhuying ji]]'' \"Collection of Precious Glories\", which contained poems by [[Cui Rong]], [[Li Jiao (Tang dynasty)|Li Jiao]], [[Zhang Yue (Tang dynasty)|Zhang Yue]], and others, arranged according to the official rank at the court of the individuals included.<ref>{{harvp|Yu|2002|p= 56}}</ref> Among the literary developments that took place during the time of Wu Zetian (and partly at her court) was the final stylistic development of the \"new style\" poetry of the [[Regulated verse|regulated verse (''jintishi'')]], by the poetic pair [[Song Zhiwen]] and [[Shen Quanqi]].\n\nWu Zetian also engaged in patronage of scholars by founding an institute to produce the ''Collection of Biographies of Famous Women''.<ref name=\"Paludan, 99\" /> The development of what is considered to be characteristic [[Tang poetry]] is traditionally ascribed to [[Chen Zi'ang]],<ref>{{harvp|Watson|1971|p= 115}}</ref> one of Wu's ministers.\n\n=== Literary allusions ===\n{{unreferenced section|date=February 2017}}\n\nConsidering the events of her life, literary allusions to Wu Zetian may carry several connotations: a woman who has inappropriately overstepped her bounds, the [[hypocrisy]] of preaching [[compassion]] while simultaneously engaging in a pattern of [[political corruption]] and vicious behavior and ruling by pulling strings in the background. For many centuries, Wu was used by the establishment as an example of what can go wrong when a woman is placed in charge.\n\nSuch sexist opposition to her was only lifted during the late 1960s when [[Mao Zedong]]'s wife [[Jiang Qing]] rehabilitated Wu as part of a propaganda campaign to suggest she be considered as a successor to her ailing husband.\n\nIn his biography ''Wu'', British author [[Jonathan Clements]] has pointed out that these wildly differing uses of a historical figure often have led to schizophrenic and often hysterical characterizations. Many alleged poisonings and other incidents, such as the premature death of her daughter, may have rational explanations that have been twisted by later opponents.\n\n== Evaluation ==\n=== Quotes ===\nThe traditional Chinese historical view on Wu Zetian generally was mixed\u2014admiring her for her abilities in governing the state, but vilifying her for her actions in seizing imperial power. [[Luo Binwang]] even wrote along these lines in a declaration during her lifetime, in support of Li Jingye's rebellion. Typical was a commentary by the [[Later Jin (Five Dynasties)|Later Jin dynasty]] historian [[Liu Xu]], the lead editor of the ''[[Old Book of Tang]]'':<ref>{{harvp|Old Book of Tang||loc= [[:zh:s:\u820a\u5510\u66f8/\u53776|vol. 6]]}}</ref>\n\n{{quote|The year that Lady Wu declared herself regent, heroic individuals were all mournful of the unfortunate turn of events, worried that the dynasty would fall, and concerned that they could not repay the grace of the deceased emperor [i.e., Emperor Gaozong] and protect his sons.

Heaven and earth became like a huge cage, and even if one could escape it, where could he go? That was lamentable. In the past, the trick of covering the nose{{NoteTag|This was a reference to a story relayed in the ''[[Han Feizi (book)|Han Feizi]]''. In the story, it was mentioned that the king of [[Qi (state)|Qi]] gave a beautiful woman to [[King Huai of Chu]] as a gift, to be his concubine. King Huai's jealous wife Queen Zheng Xiu ({{lang|zh|\u912d\u8896}}) told her, \"The King loves you greatly, but dislikes your nose. If you cover your nose whenever you see him, you can ensure that he will continue to be loved by him. She accepted Queen Zheng's suggestion. When King Huai asked Queen Zheng, \"Why does she cover her nose when she sees me?\" Queen Zheng responded, \"She often said that Your Majesty had a stench to you.\" King Huai, in anger, yelled, \"Cut off her nose!\"}} surprised the realm in its poisonousness, and the disaster of the human pig{{NoteTag|This is a reference to the torture that [[Emperor Gao of Han]]'s wife [[Empress L\u00fc Zhi]] carried out against Emperor Gao's favorite concubine [[Consort Qi]] after Emperor Gao's death, once Empress L\u00fc became empress dowager\u2014by cutting her limbs off, blinding her, deafening her, and referring to her as the human pig ({{lang|zh|\u4eba\u5f58}}).}} caused the entire state to mourn. In order to take over as empress, Empress Wu strangled her own infant daughter; her willingness to crush her own flesh and blood showed how great her viciousness and vile nature was, although this is nothing more than what evil individuals and jealous women might do. However, she accepted the words of righteousness and honored the upright. Although she was like a hen that crowed, she eventually returned the rightful rule to her son. She quickly dispelled the accusation against Wei Yuanzhong, comforted Di Renjie with kind words, respected the will of the times and suppressed her favorites, and listened to honest words and ended the terror of the secret police officials. This was good, this was good.}}\n\nSome of the diversity in terms of points of agreement and even outright divergences in modern evaluations of Wu Zetian can be seen in the following quotes by modern non-Chinese authors:\n\n{{quote|\"Wu Zetian (690\u2013705) was an extraordinary woman, attractive, exceptionally gifted, politically astute and an excellent judge of men. With single minded determination, she overcame the opposition of the Confucian establishment through her own efforts, unique among palace women by not using her own family.\n\"Her rise to power was steeped in blood....\" [[Ann Paludan]]<ref>{{harvp|Paludan|1998|p= 98}}</ref>}}\n\n{{quote|\"To the horror of traditional Chinese historians, all members of the ''shih'' class, the continued success of the T'ang was in large measure due to an ex-concubine who finally usurped the throne itself....Though she was ruthless towards her enemies, the period of her ascendency was a good one for China.

Commentary in subsequent periods, however, especially the book ''[[Zizhi Tongjian]]'' compiled by Sima Guang, criticized Wu Zetian harshly. By the period of Southern [[Song dynasty]], when [[Neo-Confucianism]] was firmly established as the mainstream political ideology of China, their ideology determined the evaluation for Wu Zetian.{{Citation needed|date=August 2018}}\n\n== Era names ==\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n| colspan=\"4\" style=\"text-align:center;\" | Zhou dynasty (690\u2013705): ''Convention: use personal name''\n|-\n!

During one particular risky robbery heist, Leo breaks the window at a jewellery store only to have his wrists broken by a gate falling. He is soon caught and brought to prison to serve his term. Throughout his stay, Leo does not reveal who he is working for to the authorities but instead serves his time, angered by Gus for running out on him during the robbery.\n\nWhen Leo is released, he returns to Gus to obtain a job. Gus harshly rebuffs him and points out how Leo\u2019s injured wrists would prevent him from working as a thief. This leads Leo to seek complete vengeance against Gus. He decides to frame Gus for murder by stealing his gun and murdering the getaway driver (now working as a cab driver) who had also abandoned him during the abortive raid. He manages to provide himself with an alibi to avoid any prosecution. During this scheme he meets Carol Dane (Howard), who is unaware of his true nature, and the two begin a romance. Later, he confronts Gus with the understanding that if he does not give Leo money, Leo will hand over the gun to the police.\n\nAfter Gus gives Leo his money, he contacts Gregory Lang (Lom), whom he is actually working under. Gregory is an antiques dealer who hired Gus to steal jewelry and art pieces for him. Meanwhile, Leo learns that Detective Inspector Rogers is investigating the murder case. He attempts to assure Rogers that he is attempting to live a life away from crime, but Rogers continues to question Leo\u2019s character and whereabouts during the night of the murder.\n\nThings begin to go downhill when Leo and Gregory learn that it was actually Gregory\u2019s gun that was used rather than Gus\u2019s. Gregory becomes upset and has his companion plot to murder Gus while forcefully threatening Leo. Leo\u2019s wrists are crushed again, but he and Gus reach a deal for Leo to bring back the gun and steal a jewel. All the while, Rogers uncovers more and more clues.\n\nWhen Leo steals the jewel and brings back the gun to Gregory, a gunfight ensues, leaving Gregory dead. As Leo jumps on the train to run away with Carol, she confronts him about his lies. Soon after, Rogers arrives after finally learning that Leo murdered the cab driver. He prepares to apprehend Leo, but Leo tries to jump out of the train window only to have the window slam shut on his wrists.\n\n==Cast==\n*[[William Hartnell]] as Leo Martin  \n*[[Raymond Lovell]] as Gus Loman  \n*[[Joyce Howard]] as Carol Dane  \n*[[Robert Beatty]] as Detective Inspector Rogers  \n*[[Herbert Lom]] as Gregory Lang  \n*[[Alan Wheatley]] as Noel Penn  \n*[[Cyril Smith (actor)|Cyril Smith]] as Detective Sergeant Charlie Weeks  \n*[[Elsie Wagstaff]] as Mrs. Wilkins  \n*[[Ian Fleming (actor)|Ian Fleming]] as Prison governor  \n*[[Wally Patch]] as Joe Fisher (garage manager)  \n*[[Ian McLean (actor)|Ian McLean]] as Detective Mason\n*[[Wilfrid Hyde-White]] as Caretaker\n\n==Reception==\n''Appointment with Crime'' was the 12th most popular film at the British box office in 1946 after ''[[The Wicked Lady]]'', ''[[The Bells of St. Mary's]]'', ''[[Piccadilly Incident]]'', ''[[The Captive Heart]]'', ''[[Road to Utopia]]'', ''[[Caravan (1946 film)|Caravan]]'', ''[[Anchors Aweigh (film)|Anchors Away]]'', ''[[The Corn Is Green (1945 film)|The Corn is Green]]'', ''[[Gilda]]'', ''[[The House on 92nd Street]]'' and ''[[The Overlanders (film)|The Overlanders]]''.<ref>{{cite news|title=Hollywood Sneaks In 15 Films on '25 Best' List of Arty Britain|newspaper=The Washington Post |date=15 Jan 1947|page= 2}}</ref>\n\n===Critical===\nThe ''[[Radio Times]]'' called it a \"solid [[Film noir|noir]],\" rating it 3/5 stars.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.radiotimes.com/film/k79fwm/appointment-with-crime/|title=Appointment with Crime \u2013 review &#124; cast and crew, movie star rating and where to watch film on TV and online|website=Radio Times}}</ref>\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* {{IMDb title|id=0039158|title=Appointment with Crime}}\n* {{Amg movie|2713|Appointment with Crime}}\n* {{rotten-tomatoes|id=appointment_with_crime|title=Appointment with Crime}}\n\n[[Category:1946 films]]\n[[Category:1940s crime thriller films]]\n[[Category:British films]]\n[[Category:British crime thriller films]]\n[[Category:English-language films]]\n[[Category:Films directed by John Harlow]]\n[[Category:British black-and-white films]]\n[[Category:Film noir]]\n[[Category:British gangster films]]\n[[Category:British films about revenge]]\n", "text_old": "{{Use dmy dates|date=September 2012}}\n{{Use British English|date=September 2012}}\n{{Infobox film\n| name           = Appointment with Crime\n| caption        = \n| image\t=\tAppointment with Crime FilmPoster.jpeg\n| director       = [[John Harlow (director)|John Harlow]]\n| producer       = [[Louis H.

The wet season in Jakarta covers the majority of the year, running from October through May. The remaining four months (June through September) constitute the city's drier season (each of these four months has an average monthly rainfall of fewer than {{convert|100|mm}}). Technically speaking, however, only August qualifies as a true dry season month, as it has less than {{convert|60|mm}} of rainfall. Located in the western part of Java, Jakarta's wet season rainfall peaks in January and February with average monthly rainfall of {{convert|299.7|mm}}, and its dry season's low point is in August with

Betawi arts have a low profile in Jakarta, and most Betawi people have moved to the suburbs, displaced by new migrants. It is easier to find Java or Minang-based wedding ceremonies rather than Betawi weddings in Jakarta. It is easier to find Javanese [[Gamelan]] instead of ''Tanjidor'' (a mixture between Betawi and Portuguese music), ''Marawis'' (a mixture between Betawi and Yemeni music) or ''Gambang Kromong'' (a mixture between Betawi and Chinese music). The Chinese influenced Betawi culture, reflected in the popularity of Chinese cakes and sweets, [[firecracker]]s and Betawi wedding attire that demonstrates Chinese and Arab influences.\n\nSome festivals such as the ''Jalan Jaksa Festival'', ''Kemang Festival'', ''Festival Condet'' and ''Lebaran Betawi'' include efforts to preserve Betawi arts by inviting artists to display performances.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.thejakartapost.com/news/2015/08/23/lebaran-betawi-an-event-maintain-bonds-and-traditions.html|title=Lebaran Betawi: An event to maintain bonds and traditions|newspaper=The Jakarta Post|accessdate=27 July 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190727113539/https://www.thejakartapost.com/news/2015/08/23/lebaran-betawi-an-event-maintain-bonds-and-traditions.html|archive-date=27 July 2019|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=https://megapolitan.kompas.com/read/2019/07/27/16343861/festival-condet-2019-upaya-untuk-lestarikan-budaya-betawi|title=Festival Condet 2019, Upaya untuk Lestarikan Budaya Betawi|newspaper=Kompas|accessdate=27 July 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190727111921/https://megapolitan.kompas.com/read/2019/07/27/16343861/festival-condet-2019-upaya-untuk-lestarikan-budaya-betawi|archive-date=27 July 2019|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book|last=Kn\u00f6rr|first=Jacqueline|title=Kreolit\u00e4t und postkoloniale Gesellschaft.

The dominant colonial styles can be divided into three periods: the [[Dutch Golden Age]] (17th to late 18th century), the transitional style period (late 18th century \u2013 19th century), and Dutch modernism (20th century). Colonial architecture is apparent in houses and villas, churches, civic buildings and offices, mostly concentrated in the [[Jakarta Old Town]] and [[Central Jakarta]]. Architects such as J.C. Schultze and [[Eduard Cuypers]] designed some of the significant buildings. Schultze's works include [[Gedung Kesenian Jakarta|Jakarta Art Building]], the Indonesia Supreme Court Building and [[Ministry of Finance (Indonesia)|Ministry of Finance]] Building, while Cuypers designed [[Museum Bank Indonesia|Bank Indonesia Museum]] and Bank Mandiri Museum.\n[[File:BNI Building.JPG|thumb|right|upright|[[Wisma 46]] in post-modernist architecture, currently the fourth tallest building in Jakarta]]\n\nIn the early 20th century, most buildings were built in [[Renaissance Revival architecture|Neo-Renaissance]] style.

Colonial architecture is apparent in houses and villas, churches, civic buildings and offices, mostly concentrated in the [[Jakarta Old Town]] and [[Central Jakarta]]. Architects such as J.C.

Schultze's works include [[Gedung Kesenian Jakarta|Jakarta Art Building]], the Indonesia Supreme Court Building and [[Ministry of Finance (Indonesia)|Ministry of Finance]] Building, while Cuypers designed [[Museum Bank Indonesia|Bank Indonesia Museum]] and Bank Mandiri Museum.\n[[File:BNI Building.JPG|thumb|right|upright|[[Wisma 46]] in post-modernist architecture, currently the fourth tallest building in Jakarta]]\n\nIn the early 20th century, most buildings were built in [[Renaissance Revival architecture|Neo-Renaissance]] style.

S. Khandekar]]. One of Khandekar's best-known works, it retells the story of the [[Hindu mythology|mythical]] [[Hindu]] king, [[Yayati]], from the Hindu epic ''[[Mahabharata]]''. The novel is narrated through [[multiple narrators]], and asks several questions relating to the nature of [[morality]]. Scholars analyzed the book for its depiction of hero, Yayati, as a representative of modern man. Accepted as classic of [[Marathi literature]], it won several awards including the [[Sahitya Akademi Award]] in 1960 and the [[Jnanapith Award]] in 1974.\n\n==Background==\nIn his preface to ''Yayati'', Khandekar states that he was drawn to the original story from the ''Mahabharata'' at multiple levels, and for many reasons.<ref name=\"Gupta1982\">{{cite journal|last=Gupta|first=Santosh|title='Yayati': The Myth and Its Interpretation|journal=[[Indian Literature (journal)|Indian Literature]]|date=September\u2013October 1982|volume=25|issue=5|publisher=Sahitya Akademi|publication-place=New Delhi|pages=150\u2013157|issn=0019-5804|jstor=23331119}} {{closed access}}</ref> The resulting novel is a modern retelling of the story of the mythological Hindu king, who enjoyed all the pleasures of the flesh for a millennium only to realize how empty of meaning was his pursuit of desire.\n\nKhandekar saw modernity, with its materialistic values, as an elephant on the rampage through the delicate garden of traditional virtues and feelings, blurring the distinction between good and evil, between selfishness and compassion, and blinding people to the evils of the world. In response, Khandekar looked to the past and chose the story of Yayati, making use of a kind of tale often dismissed as the fairy stories of old women to describe the vacuousness and futility of contemporary society's endless obsession with avarice and lust. Where Khandekar's previous writing had focussed predominantly on style and imagination, in ''Yayati'' these concerns are integrated into a form of social realism the author had little explored until this point.<ref name=\"Khandekar1977\">{{cite book|last=Khandekar|first=V.

The early life of Yayati is characterized by a number of disillusionment. He comes to know that his mother weans him for fear of losing her beauty. Yayati's faith in motherly love is shattered with this knowledge. Later on he experiences cruelty and passion which in a sense challenges his manhood. He then has a fleeting experience of carnal love.<ref name=\"KMGeorge1997\"/>\n\nWhen he has to leave the security of the palace for [[Ashvamedha]] [[Yajna]] (a horse sacrifice ritual in Hindu tradition), he meets his elder brother Yati, who became an ascetic abandoning all material pleasures. After this he meets Kacha and sees in him a model of happy, peaceful life. It is, however, when his father, Nahusha, dies, that Yayati undergoes a traumatic experience and for the first time, realizes the destructive power of death, and is gripped with fear and helplessness. While in this state of mind, he comes in contact with Mukulika, a maidservant in the palace. Yayati's attempts to bury his grief in carnal pleasures constitute a critical period of his life. Later on he meets Alaka and experiences sisterly love; but Alaka ultimately falls a prey to Queen Mother's cruelty. Precisely at this time, Yayati comes to know of a curse on his father, foretelling that he (the father) and his children shall never be happy.<ref name=\"KMGeorge1997\"/>\n\nThe second part of the narrative tells the story of Yayati's married life. We come to know of Devayani's love for Kacha and his quiet but firm refusal. Devayani decides to take revenge on Kacha by making advances to Yayati and ultimately succeeds in marrying him. Sharmishtha, originally a princess, is now living with Devayani as her maidservant. It is at this time that she comes in contact with Yayati. While Devayani is unable to establish any rapport with Yayati, Sharmishtha finds union with him both in body and mind. This union begets a son and for sometime Yayati experiences happiness of life. However, Sharmishtha runs away from Hastinapur on a tempestuous night. Yayati now suffers estrangement from Devayani as well as loss of Sharmishtha. This causes a vacuum in his life and he speedily advances on the path of moral degradation.<ref name=\"KMGeorge1997\"/>\n\nDuring the period of 18 years, Yayati neglects his duties as a king and leads a life of unfettered carnal pleasures with women like Madhavi and Taraka. Even when Hastinapur is attacked by the enemies, Yayati, because of his anger against Devayani and his life of sensual pleasures, continues to neglect his duties. His son [[Yadu]] is imprisoned. Puru, younger son of Yayati, manages his release. Then Shukracharya, Devayani's father, seeing his daughter's unhappy marriage and Yayati's degradation, puts on him the curse of old age.<ref name=\"KMGeorge1997\"/>\n\nWhen Yayati finds himself suddenly old, his unfulfilled desires disturbs him. He requests his sons to lend him their youth. His son Puru comes to his help and lends Yayati his youth. However, Puru and Sharmishtha's undemanding love for Yayati help him realize his mistakes, and within a few minutes of accepting Puru's youth, he resolves to return it.<ref name=\"Gupta1982\"/> Devayani also undergoes a change of heart. At the end, Yayati hands over the reigns of government to Puru with all the blessings and seeks retirement to forest-life with Devayani and Sharmishtha. Yayati's journey from attachment to detachment thus ends here.<ref name=\"KMGeorge1997\"/>\n\n==Deviation from the Mahabharata==\nKhandekar has maid some significant deviation in the novel from the original story of Mahabharata.<ref name=\"Gupta1982\"/>\n\nThe first significant deviation occurs in the episode of the death of Yayati's father, Nahusha. In The Mahabharata, Nahusha is cursed by the [[Rishi]]s (sages) to live on earth in the form of a serpent. After suffering for a long period in this fate, he eventually meets [[Pandava]] king [[Yudhishthira]], who free him from the curse. In the novel, Nahusha is shown dying in his palace, desperately clinging to life. He pleads to his wife and son to give him a few hours of their own lives so that he may live a little longer. He fears death for he still has unfulfilled desires. Nahusha's helpless struggle with death leaves a lasting sense of insecurity on his son's mind and affects his whole life.<ref name=\"Gupta1982\"/>\n\nIn the original story of Mahabharata, Yayati enjoys his son Puru's youth for a thousand years, then returns the youth to his son, and lives for a long time, with sages in the Himalayas, and is finally taken up in Heaven. While in the novel, Yayati can return the youth of his son only at the cost of his life. He decides to return it immediately after a few minutes of accepting Puru's youth, and he is saved from death by Kacha using Sanjivani Mantra.<ref name=\"Gupta1982\"/>\n\n==Analysis==\nThe major characters in this narrative has been seen exemplifying major attitudes to life. Yayati represents an attitude of material pleasure-seeking. Devayani shows excessive involvement in power and pride. Sharmishtha stands for undemanding, selfless love while Kacha symbolizes a clean, moral and moderate enjoyment of life with a sense of well-being of the human race. Yati, rejecting of all material pleasures, is presented as counterpoint to Yayati.<ref name=\"KMGeorge1997\"/>\n\nThe novel ask several moral questions \u2014 How does one define the fulfillment of life?, How can one separate the boundaries between morality and immorality?, What is the ultimate place of the pursuit of material pleasure in the context of spiritual values?<ref name=\"KMGeorge1997\"/><ref name=\"Satchidanandan2000\">{{cite journal|last=Satchidanandan|first=K.|author-link=Satchidanandan|title=Reflection: Yayati, Yet Again|journal=[[Indian Literature (journal)|Indian Literature]]|date=November\u2013December 2000|volume=44|issue=6|publisher=Sahitya Akademi|publication-place=New Delhi|pages=10|issn=0019-5804|jstor=23343302}} {{closed access}}</ref>\n\n==Reception==\n''Yayati'' is one of Khandekar's best-known works,<ref>{{cite journal|title=Jnanpith Award to Marathi Writer, V.

S. Khandekar]]. One of Khandekar's best-known works, it retells the story of the [[Hindu mythology|mythical]] [[Hindu]] king [[Yayati]], from the Hindu epic ''[[Mahabharata]]''. The novel is narrated through [[multiple narrators]], and asks several questions relating to the nature of [[morality]]. Scholars analyzed the book for its depiction of hero, Yayati, as a representative of modern man. Accepted as classic of [[Marathi literature]], it won several awards including the [[Sahitya Akademi Award]] in 1960 and the [[Jnanapith Award]] in 1974.\n\n==Background==\nIn his preface to ''Yayati'', Khandekar states that he was drawn to the original story from the ''Mahabharata'' at multiple levels, and for many reasons.<ref name=\"Gupta1982\">{{cite journal|last=Gupta|first=Santosh|title='Yayati': The Myth and Its Interpretation|journal=[[Indian Literature (journal)|Indian Literature]]|date=September\u2013October 1982|volume=25|issue=5|publisher=Sahitya Akademi|publication-place=New Delhi|pages=150\u2013157|issn=0019-5804|jstor=23331119}} {{closed access}}</ref> The resulting novel is a modern retelling of the story of the mythological Hindu king, who enjoyed all the pleasures of the flesh for a millennium only to realize how empty of meaning was his pursuit of desire.\n\nKhandekar saw modernity, with its materialistic values, as an elephant on the rampage through the delicate garden of traditional virtues and feelings, blurring the distinction between good and evil, between selfishness and compassion, and blinding people to the evils of the world. In response, Khandekar looked to the past and chose the story of Yayati, making use of a kind of tale often dismissed as the fairy stories of old women to describe the vacuousness and futility of contemporary society's endless obsession with avarice and lust. Where Khandekar's previous writing had focussed predominantly on style and imagination, in ''Yayati'' these concerns are integrated into a form of social realism the author had little explored until this point.<ref name=\"Khandekar1977\">{{cite book|last=Khandekar|first=V.

It is produced by [[Shine Australia]] and screens on [[Network 10]]. Restaurateur and chef [[Gary Mehigan]], chef [[George Calombaris]] and food critic [[Matt Preston]] served as the show's main judges until 2019, when they were replaced by [[MasterChef Australia (series 4)|Series 4]] winner and chef [[Andy Allen (chef)|Andy Allen]], food critic Melissa Leong, and restaurateur and chef [[Jock Zonfrillo]].\n\nThe series has also spawned four spin-off series: ''[[Celebrity MasterChef Australia]]'', which featured celebrity contestants,<ref name=\"celeb\">{{cite web|url=http://www.news.com.au/heraldsun/story/0,21985,25791148-661,00.html|title=Herald Sun|work=news.com.au|accessdate=25 April 2017}}</ref> ''[[Junior MasterChef Australia]]'', which featured younger contestants,<ref name=\"jmc\">{{cite web|url=http://www.news.com.au/couriermail/story/0,23739,26269545-5003422,00.html|title=The Courier Mail|work=news.com.au|accessdate=25 April 2017}}</ref> ''[[MasterChef Australia All-Stars]]'', which featured returning contestants from the first three series,<ref name=\"allstars\" /> and ''[[MasterChef Australia: The Professionals]]'', which featured professional chefs as contestants.<ref name=\"prof\">{{cite web|url=http://www.tvtonight.com.au/2012/10/masterchef-the-professionals-vs-my-kitchen-rules.html|title=MasterChef: The Professionals vs My Kitchen Rules?|date=29 October 2012|work=tvtonight.com.au|accessdate=25 April 2017}}</ref> These spin-off shows did not air in 2014 after the producers of the show announced that they wanted to solely focus on the original version.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.tvtonight.com.au/2013/09/masterchef-sticks-to-one-series-for-2014.html|title=MasterChef sticks to one series for 2014|date=31 August 2013|work=tvtonight.com.au|accessdate=25 April 2017}}</ref>\n\n==Format==\n''MasterChef Australia'' has a different format from that of the original British ''[[MasterChef (UK TV series)|MasterChef]]'' and ''MasterChef Goes Large'' formats. Initial rounds consist of a large number of hopeful contestants from across Australia individually \"auditioning\" by presenting a food dish before the three judges in order to gain one of 50 semi-final places. Entrants must be over 18 years old and their main source of income cannot come from preparing and cooking fresh food in a professional environment.<ref>{{cite web|first=David|last=Knox|title=Auditions: Masterchef|url=http://www.tvtonight.com.au/2008/12/auditions-masterchef.html|publisher=tvtonight.com.au|date=9 December 2008|accessdate=12 January 2009}}</ref>\n\nThe semi-finalists then compete in several challenges that test their food knowledge and preparation skills. In Season 1, the top 50 competed until 20 were left, with the final 20 progressing to the main stage of the show. From Season 2, 24 contestants progress. The contestants will then be whittled down through a number of individual and team-based cooking challenges and weekly elimination rounds until a winning MasterChef is crowned. The winner plays for a prize that includes chef training from leading professional chefs, the chance to have their own [[cookbook]] published, and [[A$]]250,000 in cash.\n\n===Episodes===\n''MasterChef Australia'' airs five nights a week from Sunday to Thursday. Each night features a different episode format, however some episodes modify the format slightly. The typical episode formats are as follows:\n\n'''Sunday''' is the ''Challenge'' night. From series 3, it can range from a variety of challenges, including a Mystery Box, where each contestant is given the same box of ingredients and are to create a dish using only those ingredients. The Judges then pick 3 dishes Based on Technique and Visual Appearance Alone and a winner chosen. There can also be an Invention Test, where contestants have to invent a dish relevant to a theme using a core ingredient. There can also be Off-Site Challenges and Team Challenges, which often involve cooking for large numbers of people. The top three contestants who made the best dishes are selected by the judges, from which a winner is chosen to compete in the Immunity Challenge. After this the bottom three are revealed, who will face off in an elimination challenge the next night. In the first two series, it would always consist of a Mystery Box, where the winner was able to choose the core ingredient for the Invention Test.\n\n'''Monday''' episodes feature the ''Pressure Test''. The bottom three from the previous night's challenge are given a recipe for a particular dish they are to emulate in an allocated time. Once completed they are taken in to the judges to be tasted, before all three contestants are seated in front of the judges for critiquing. The judges then eliminate the contestant out of the three that performed least adequately in the test.\n\n'''Tuesday''' episodes feature the ''Immunity Challenge'', where the winner of the Sunday challenge competes against a guest, which can vary from a chef, apprentice, or to a home cook in a cook off. The contestant is given the choice of two pantries of ingredients they can use, usually contrasting such as \"Black\" and \"White\". The contestant gets a head start to complete the dish before their opponent starts cooking and after the allotted time for both is finished, the dishes are presented to the judges for tasting and scoring out of ten. The judges are not aware which dish was made by which person, however. If the contestant's dish's score is equal to or higher than that of the guest, they are crowned the winner of the challenge. In the first series they are given a free pass to the finals week of the competition and can go home. From series 2 onwards, they receive a pin that allows them to save themselves from one future elimination.\n\n'''Wednesday''' features a ''Team Challenge''. The contestants are split into teams, and are given a task, and a set amount of time to complete the challenge. Tasks have included presenting a three course meal to a celebrity guest, running a restaurant for an evening or catering an event such as a birthday party or wedding. Once completed and judged the teams are given the results, which can be determined by which team the judges think did the best, or receiving the most votes or making the most money by the people the teams had to cook for, with members of the losing team facing an elimination the next night. The winning team safe from elimination receives a reward (for example lunch at a top restaurant).\n\n'''Thursday''' is another ''Elimination''. The two worst performing contestants from the losing team in the team challenge compete against each other in a head to head challenge to determine who will be eliminated. The loser of the challenge is then eliminated. On some occasions, all members of the losing team will be selected to compete as individuals in the elimination challenge. In the first series, a different elimination process was used. The contestants from the losing team were to vote for a contestant that they each feel did not perform to their best and may have cost them the challenge. After voting the team is called in together to announce the results of the vote, with the contestant with the most votes being eliminated from the competition. If the previous challenge was an individual challenge, the bottom two contestants competed in a head to head taste test where one contestant at a time named one ingredient of a particular dish or sauce, and the first person to name an incorrect ingredient is eliminated. ''MasterClass'' airs on Thursday following the elimination show and is generally limited to themed weeks. Here, judges George, Gary and Matt run a masterclass for the remaining contestants, which usually call back to some of the challenges from the previous week. For example, they may revisit the Mystery Box challenge and demonstrate some other dishes that could have been made or redo one of the contestants' dishes to give tips on how it could have been improved.\n\n==Hosts and judges==\n===Main series===\n{| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\" style=\"font-size:90%;\"\n|+ Timeline of hosts, judges and other personnel\n!

It is produced by [[Shine Australia]] and screens on [[Network 10]]. Restaurateur and chef [[Gary Mehigan]], chef [[George Calombaris]] and food critic [[Matt Preston]] served as the show's main judges until 2019, when they were replaced by [[MasterChef Australia (series 4)|Series 4]] winner and chef [[Andy Allen (chef)|Andy Allen]], food critic Melissa Leong, and restaurateur and chef [[Jock Zonfrillo]].\n\nThe series has also spawned four spin-off series: ''[[Celebrity MasterChef Australia]]'', which featured celebrity contestants,<ref name=\"celeb\">{{cite web|url=http://www.news.com.au/heraldsun/story/0,21985,25791148-661,00.html|title=Herald Sun|work=news.com.au|accessdate=25 April 2017}}</ref> ''[[Junior MasterChef Australia]]'', which featured younger contestants,<ref name=\"jmc\">{{cite web|url=http://www.news.com.au/couriermail/story/0,23739,26269545-5003422,00.html|title=The Courier Mail|work=news.com.au|accessdate=25 April 2017}}</ref> ''[[MasterChef Australia All-Stars]]'', which featured returning contestants from the first three series,<ref name=\"allstars\" /> and ''[[MasterChef Australia: The Professionals]]'', which featured professional chefs as contestants.<ref name=\"prof\">{{cite web|url=http://www.tvtonight.com.au/2012/10/masterchef-the-professionals-vs-my-kitchen-rules.html|title=MasterChef: The Professionals vs My Kitchen Rules?|date=29 October 2012|work=tvtonight.com.au|accessdate=25 April 2017}}</ref> These spin-off shows did not air in 2014 after the producers of the show announced that they wanted to solely focus on the original version.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.tvtonight.com.au/2013/09/masterchef-sticks-to-one-series-for-2014.html|title=MasterChef sticks to one series for 2014|date=31 August 2013|work=tvtonight.com.au|accessdate=25 April 2017}}</ref>\n\n==Format==\n''MasterChef Australia'' has a different format from that of the original British ''[[MasterChef (UK TV series)|MasterChef]]'' and ''MasterChef Goes Large'' formats. Initial rounds consist of a large number of hopeful contestants from across Australia individually \"auditioning\" by presenting a food dish before the three judges in order to gain one of 50 semi-final places. Entrants must be over 18 years old and their main source of income cannot come from preparing and cooking fresh food in a professional environment.<ref>{{cite web|first=David|last=Knox|title=Auditions: Masterchef|url=http://www.tvtonight.com.au/2008/12/auditions-masterchef.html|publisher=tvtonight.com.au|date=9 December 2008|accessdate=12 January 2009}}</ref>\n\nThe semi-finalists then compete in several challenges that test their food knowledge and preparation skills. In Season 1, the top 50 competed until 20 were left, with the final 20 progressing to the main stage of the show. From Season 2, 24 contestants progress. The contestants will then be whittled down through a number of individual and team-based cooking challenges and weekly elimination rounds until a winning MasterChef is crowned. The winner plays for a prize that includes chef training from leading professional chefs, the chance to have their own [[cookbook]] published, and [[A$]]250,000 in cash.\n\n===Episodes===\n''MasterChef Australia'' airs five nights a week from Sunday to Thursday. Each night features a different episode format, however some episodes modify the format slightly. The typical episode formats are as follows:\n\n'''Sunday''' is the ''Challenge'' night. From series 3, it can range from a variety of challenges, including a Mystery Box, where each contestant is given the same box of ingredients and are to create a dish using only those ingredients. The Judges then pick 3 dishes Based on Technique and Visual Appearance Alone and a winner chosen. There can also be an Invention Test, where contestants have to invent a dish relevant to a theme using a core ingredient. There can also be Off-Site Challenges and Team Challenges, which often involve cooking for large numbers of people. The top three contestants who made the best dishes are selected by the judges, from which a winner is chosen to compete in the Immunity Challenge. After this the bottom three are revealed, who will face off in an elimination challenge the next night. In the first two series, it would always consist of a Mystery Box, where the winner was able to choose the core ingredient for the Invention Test.\n\n'''Monday''' episodes feature the ''Pressure Test''. The bottom three from the previous night's challenge are given a recipe for a particular dish they are to emulate in an allocated time. Once completed they are taken in to the judges to be tasted, before all three contestants are seated in front of the judges for critiquing. The judges then eliminate the contestant out of the three that performed least adequately in the test.\n\n'''Tuesday''' episodes feature the ''Immunity Challenge'', where the winner of the Sunday challenge competes against a guest, which can vary from a chef, apprentice, or to a home cook in a cook off. The contestant is given the choice of two pantries of ingredients they can use, usually contrasting such as \"Black\" and \"White\". The contestant gets a head start to complete the dish before their opponent starts cooking and after the allotted time for both is finished, the dishes are presented to the judges for tasting and scoring out of ten. The judges are not aware which dish was made by which person, however. If the contestant's dish's score is equal to or higher than that of the guest, they are crowned the winner of the challenge. In the first series they are given a free pass to the finals week of the competition and can go home. From series 2 onwards, they receive a pin that allows them to save themselves from one future elimination.\n\n'''Wednesday''' features a ''Team Challenge''. The contestants are split into teams, and are given a task, and a set amount of time to complete the challenge. Tasks have included presenting a three course meal to a celebrity guest, running a restaurant for an evening or catering an event such as a birthday party or wedding. Once completed and judged the teams are given the results, which can be determined by which team the judges think did the best, or receiving the most votes or making the most money by the people the teams had to cook for, with members of the losing team facing an elimination the next night. The winning team safe from elimination receives a reward (for example lunch at a top restaurant).\n\n'''Thursday''' is another ''Elimination''. The two worst performing contestants from the losing team in the team challenge compete against each other in a head to head challenge to determine who will be eliminated. The loser of the challenge is then eliminated. On some occasions, all members of the losing team will be selected to compete as individuals in the elimination challenge. In the first series, a different elimination process was used. The contestants from the losing team were to vote for a contestant that they each feel did not perform to their best and may have cost them the challenge. After voting the team is called in together to announce the results of the vote, with the contestant with the most votes being eliminated from the competition. If the previous challenge was an individual challenge, the bottom two contestants competed in a head to head taste test where one contestant at a time named one ingredient of a particular dish or sauce, and the first person to name an incorrect ingredient is eliminated. ''MasterClass'' airs on Thursday following the elimination show and is generally limited to themed weeks. Here, judges George, Gary and Matt run a masterclass for the remaining contestants, which usually call back to some of the challenges from the previous week. For example, they may revisit the Mystery Box challenge and demonstrate some other dishes that could have been made or redo one of the contestants' dishes to give tips on how it could have been improved.\n\n==Hosts and judges==\n===Main series===\n{| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\" style=\"font-size:90%;\"\n|+ Timeline of hosts, judges and other personnel\n!

Du Bois]].{{sfn|Kauffman|1982|pp=366\u2013367}}\n\nMore recently it has been active on social conservative issues, including [[opposition to same-sex marriage]], [[abortion]], [[divorce]], and [[birth control]], including requiring employers to provide it in violation of their religious beliefs. It has also been critical of the [[Immigration policy of Donald Trump|President Donald Trump's immigration policy]], and supportive of immigrants and refugees. Both in the United States and around the world, it has defended [[religious freedom]]. \n\n==Background==\nThe [[Knights of Columbus]] were active politically from an early date. In the years following the [[Second Vatican Council]], however, according to Christopher Kauffman, the Catholic anti-defamation character of the order began to diminish as Catholics became more accepted, and the leadership attempted to stimulate the membership to a greater awareness of the religious and moral issues confronting the Church. That led to the creation of a \"variety of new programs reflecting the proliferation of the new social ministries of the church\".{{sfn|Kauffman|1982}}\n\nIn December 2018, during the confirmation process of nominee [[Brian C. Buescher]] to the [[United States district court|U.S. District Court]], \"liberal\" Senator Mazie K. Hirono<ref name=\"Mazie Hirono on the Issues\">{{cite web |title=Mazie Hirono on the Issues |publisher=On the Issues |access-date=November 18, 2018 |url=http://www.ontheissues.org/house/Mazie_Hirono.htm }}]</ref> characterized the position the Knights of Columbus have taken on social issues as \"extreme\" and asked Buescher, \"If confirmed, do you intend to end your membership with this organization to avoid any appearance of bias?\"<ref name=jud>[https://www.judiciary.senate.gov/imo/media/doc/Buescher%20Responses%20to%20QFRs.pdf \"Nomination of Brian Buescher to the United States District Court for the District of Nebraska Questions for the Record December 5, 2018\", Judiciary.senate.gov.]</ref> Senator [[Kamala Harris]] also asked about opinions held by the organization and asked Buescher if he was aware these views when he joined the Knights of Columbus. Buescher replied that he was eighteen years old when he joined and did not recall if the Knights had at that time taken any position on those issues with which the Senator now disagreed.<ref name=jud/>\n\nWriting in the [[Los Angeles Times]], Rabbi Mitchell Rocklin said that the senators approach amounted to a \"religious test\" such as is precluded by Article VI of the Constitution. Rabbi Rocklin said: \"The line of questioning Buescher faced about his affiliation with the Knights of Columbus sets a troubling precedent of intolerance\u2014one that is unconscionable in principle and terrible in practice for people of all faiths who seek a role in public service. ...For centuries, many Jews have suffered a similar 'dual loyalty' smear: the anti-Semitic lie that, faced with a choice between country and religion, a Jewish public official will put his faith before his country.\"<ref name=Rocklin>[https://www.latimes.com/opinion/op-ed/la-oe-rocklin-brian-buescher-20190116-story.html Rocklin, Mitchell. \"Op-Ed: Keep religious tests out of the Senate\", ''Los Angeles Times'', January 16, 2019]</ref> Micklin noted the anti-Semitism experienced by Justices [[Louis Brandeis]] and [[Benjamin N.

To destroy the church's influence over the Mexican people, anti-clerical statutes were inserted into the Constitution, beginning a 10-year persecution of Catholics that resulted in the deaths of thousands, including [[List of Knights of Columbus#Saints|several priests who were also Knights of Columbus]]. Leaders of the order began speaking out against the Mexican government. ''Columbia'', the official magazine of the Knights, published articles critical of the regime. After the November 1926 cover of ''Columbia'' portrayed Knights carrying a banner of liberty and warning of \"The Red Peril of Mexico,\" the Mexican legislature banned both the order and the magazine throughout the country.<ref name=\"Pelowski\" />\n\nIn 1926, the Massachusetts State Council passed a resolution opposing the Mexican government and in defense of human rights.{{sfn|Lapomarda|1992|p=37}} Ten days later, State Deputy [[Edmund J.

As part of their Ultrasound Initiative in the United States and Canada, 1,000 ultrasound machines were donated to pregnancy centers between 2009 and 2018.<ref name=\"lives\" /><ref name=\"uic\" /><ref name=\"ultra\" /><ref name=\"culturelife\" /><ref name=\"regalia2\" /> The Knights believe that, because ultrasound machines are so expensive, without their active financial support many pregnancy care centers would not be able to afford them.<ref name=\"culturelife\" /> During a pregnancy, ultrasound exams are medically necessary for a variety of diagnostic reasons, and the sonograms they produce help women better visualize their [[foetus]].<ref name=\"culturelife\" /> Research shows that women are less likely to obtain an abortion after seeing ultrasound images, particularly as the child's gestational age increases.<ref name=\"cali\" /><ref name=\"culturelife\" /> In the January 2019 issue of ''Columbia,'' four women were profiled, including one who conceived a child through rape, who chose not to have abortions after seeing their unborn children on ultrasound machines provided by state and local councils.<ref name=\"lives\" /> The order also supports women in crisis pregnancies with alternatives to abortion, including adoption.<ref name=\"culturelife\" />\n\nThey have also called for national healing and reconciliation following a series of violent mass murders including the [[Orlando nightclub shooting|Pulse nightclub massacre]] and [[2015 San Bernardino attack]].<ref name=\"healing\" /><ref name=\"fournier\" /> Supreme Knight Carl Anderson has also said that the United States owes the victims of the [[Charleston church shooting]] in 2015 \"a debt of gratitude for showing us a noble path,\" calling them \"courageous Christians.\"<ref name=\"fournier\" />\n\n==Domestic policy==\nDuring the early part of the 20th century, both the Supreme and local councils found themselves in agreement with the principles of the [[Progressivism in the United States|Progressive movement]].{{sfn|Kauffman|1982|p=166}} Senator [[Albert J. Beveridge]], an intellectual leader of the Progressive movement, was the featured speaker at \"a grand patriotic demonstration\" at [[Carnegie Hall]] in 1906, and [[James C. Monaghan]], the Supreme Lecturer, frequently spoke out in favor of progressive causes in ''Columbiad'' and elsewhere.{{sfn|Kauffman|1982|p=166}} The Massachusetts State Council was supportive of [[New Deal]] policies in 1933.{{sfn|Lapomarda|1992|p=43}}\n\nIn the 1980s, the Knights supported an amendment to the [[United States Constitution]] permitting prayer in public school.<ref name=\"right\" /> \nWhen president [[Ronald Reagan]] attempted to tax fraternal insurance companies such as the Knights of Columbus, then\u2013Supreme Knight [[Virgil Dechant]] used White House connections to scuttle the effort.<ref name=\"franklin\" /> In addition, local councils set up phone banks and letter writing campaigns to oppose the measure, which would have diminished the Knights' ability to make charitable contributions.<ref name=\"franklin\" /> They were aided by Democratic Congressman [[Brian J. Donnelly]] of Massachusetts.{{sfn|Lapomarda|1992|p=129}}\n\n===Pledge of Allegiance===\nThe order was influential in the early stages of the movement that eventually led to the decision by the [[United States Congress|US Congress]] to add the phrase \"under God\" to the [[Pledge of Allegiance (United States)|Pledge of Allegiance]] in 1954.<ref name=\"under\" /> Though others had proposed the idea before,<ref name=\"baer\" /> the idea bubbled up in the order from [[Knights of Columbus#Fourth degree|Fourth Degree assemblies]].{{sfn|Kauffman|1982|p=385}}<ref name=\"canipe\" /><ref name=\"newsweek\" /> In April 1951, the Supreme Board of Directors adopted a resolution directing the Fourth Degree to add the words to their recitations.{{sfn|Kauffman|1982|p=385}} The Knights were the first group to voluntarily do so on a regular basis.<ref name=\"under\" />\n\nThe Knights also began lobbying Congress to make the change.<ref name=\"under\" />{{sfn|Kauffman|1982|p=385}}<ref name=\"jones\" /> At the urging of five state councils, the Supreme Council adopted a resolution in 1952 encouraging Congress to officially insert the words into the pledge.{{sfn|Kauffman|1982|p=385}} Adding the phrase, the order believed, would acknowledge \"the dependence of our Nation and its people upon the Creator of the Universe.\"<ref name=\"canipe\" /> New York Congressman [[Edmund Radwan]] entered the resolution into the Congressional Record on March 25, 1953.<ref name=\"canipe\" />{{sfn|Kauffman|1982|p=385}} Supreme Knight [[Luke E. Hart]], the then-president of the [[National Fraternal Congress]], got the other 110 fraternal societies to adopt the resolution as well.{{sfn|Kauffman|1982|p=385}} The effort was supported by the Massachusetts State Council.{{sfn|Lapomarda|992|page=76}}\n\nAfter signing the change into law, Eisenhower wrote to Supreme Knight [[Luke E. Hart]] thanking the Knights for their efforts to get the phrase added.{{sfn|Kauffman|1982|p=385}} In his letter, Eisenhower praised the order's patriotism{{sfn|Kauffman|1982|pp=385-6}} and said \"For the contribution which your organization has made to this cause, we must be genuinely grateful.\"<ref name=\"pledge\" /> In October 1954, the National Executive Committee of the [[American Legion]] adopted a resolution thanking the Knights for initiating, sponsoring, and bringing about the amendment.<ref name=\"pledge\" />\n\nIn 2014, lawyers from the Knights and other organizations joined the [[Matawan-Aberdeen Regional School District]] to defend the daily recitation of the pledge in a lawsuit brought by the [[American Humanist Association]].<ref name=\"hopkins\" />\n\n===Promoting Christopher Columbus===\nAt the behest of the Knights, Congress appropriated $100,000 to construct the [[Columbus Fountain]] in front of [[Washington Union Station|Union Station]] in Washington, DC, in 1912.{{sfn|Kauffman|1982|p=162}}<ref name=\"59th Congress\" /> The Supreme Knight was made a member of the committee to erect it.{{sfn|Kauffman|1982|p=162}}<ref name=\"59th Congress\" />\n\nSimilar lobbying convinced many [[State legislature (United States)|state legislatures]] to adopt October 12 as [[Columbus Day]], and led to President Franklin D. Roosevelt's confirmation of Columbus Day as a federal holiday in 1937.{{sfnm |1a1=Kauffman |1y=1982 |1p=164 |2a1=Sale |2p=359}}<ref name=\"stat657\" /><ref name=\"oct12\" /> While they had long been active proponents of [[Catholic Social Teaching]] and its application to [[public policy]], the efforts to honor Columbus marked the order's first efforts at direct lobbying of government officials on specific issues.{{sfn|Kauffman|1982|p=230}}\n\n==Foreign policy==\nDuring the [[Cold War]], the [[foreign policy of the United States]] and the Knights' promotion of [[Catholic Social Teaching]] frequently intersected.{{sfn|Kauffman|1982|p=386}} At the outbreak of the [[Hungarian Revolution of 1956]], Supreme Knight Hart spoke with President [[Dwight Eisenhower]]'s Chief of Staff, [[Sherman Adams]], urging him to have the president press the issue before a special session of the [[United Nations]].{{sfn|Kauffman|1982|p=386}} Hart hoped the UN would \"take action with reference to the massacre of the people of Hungary by the Communist government of the Soviet Union.\"{{sfn|Kauffman|1982|p=386}} The Supreme Board of Directors adopted a resolution \"expressing the sympathy of our Order for the Hungarian people\" and urged the UN to \"take immediate steps to restrain the murderous assault of the armed troops of the Soviet Union.\"{{sfn|Kauffman|1982|p=386}} In 1933, the Massachusetts State Council opposed diplomatic recognition of the [[Soviet Union]].{{sfn|Lapomarda|1992|p=43}}\n\nIn the 1950s, rumors began circulating that Eisenhower would invite [[Josip Broz Tito]], the dictator of [[Yugoslavia]], to visit the United States.{{sfn|Kauffman|1982|p=386}} The Supreme Council went on record as opposing the visit.{{sfn|Lapomarda|1992|p=86}} In late 1956, Hart wired Eisenhower to express \"amazement that he should consider inviting to this country the jailer of Cardinal [[Aloysius Stepinac|[Aloysius] Stepinac]], the tyrant of Yugoslavia, the persecutor of religion, and the accomplice of the murders of Budapest.\"{{sfn|Kauffman|1982|p=386}} Shortly after the new year, Hart requested a meeting with Eisenhower but, as the president was traveling at the time, he met instead with Undersecretary of State [[Robert T. Murphy]] instead.{{sfn|Kauffman|1982|p=386}} By the end of the month Eisenhower announced that Tito would not be visiting, and Hart declared victory.{{sfn|Kauffman|1982|p=387}}\n\nAt the 1953 Supreme Convention, the delegates adopted a resolution calling for a united Ireland.{{sfn|Lapormarda|1993|p=73}} The Supreme Council adopted a resolution in 1969 endorsing the aims and justice of the [[Vietnam War]], but as the war progressed ''Columbia'' magazine began to question the effectiveness of the United States' military effort.{{sfn|Kauffman|1982|p=412}} In Massachusetts, the State Council passed resolutions in the early 1960s that \"reflect genuine concern for the nation.\"{{sfn|Lapomarda|1992|p=92}} They include calling on the Catholic Church to prevent the spread of communism in Latin America and opposing communist China from joining the United Nations.{{sfn|Lapomarda|1992|p=92}}\n\n==Other countries==\nIn Canada, by 1910 the Knights were seen as \"those laymen who could successfully defend the Church from external opposition when required and, more importantly, could voice the opinions and teachings of the Church, bringing them to bear of the problems of Canadian society.\"{{sfn|McGowan|1999|p=177}} Toronto Council 1388 established a public affairs committee in 1912 that was mandated to increase the interest of Catholics in public affairs and to promote their participation in political life.{{sfn|McGowan|1999|p=178}} In the [[Philippines]], local Knights campaigned against government sponsored [[birth control]] and [[condom]] advocacy.<ref name=\"phil\" />\n\n==Notes==\n{{notelist}}\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|refs=\n<ref name=\"59th Congress\">{{USStatute|59|267|34|1413|1907|03|04|HR|13304}}</ref>\n<ref name=\"advocate\">{{cite news |last=O'Loughlin |first=Michael |date=28 January 2014 |title=Report: Knights of Columbus Spends Millions to Fight LGBT Rights |url=https://www.advocate.com/politics/religion/2014/01/28/report-knights-columbus-spends-millions-fight-lgbt-rights |website=Advocate.com |publisher=Here Publishing |access-date=29 March 2018}}</ref>\n<ref name=\"aid\">{{Cite news | url = https://www.catholicnewsagency.com/news/knights-of-columbus-praise-increased-us-aid-for-persecuted-iraqis-78835 | title = Knights of Columbus praise increased US aid for persecuted Iraqis | date = 17 January 2018 | accessdate = 23 July 2018 | publisher = Catholic News Agency}}</ref>\n<ref name=\"arab\">{{cite magazine | url = http://www.kofc.org/en/columbia/detail/2011_12_ethnic_council.html | title = Many Cultures, One Faith | date = 29 November 2011 | accessdate = 11 July 2018 | first = Mike | last = Mastromatteo | magazine = Columbia}}</ref>\n<ref name=\"applaud\">{{cite news | title = Knights Applaud New Law to Aid Genocide Victims in Iraq, Syria | magazine = Columbia | publisher = The Knights of Columbus | volume = 99 | number = 1 | date = January 2019 | page = 6}}</ref>\n<ref name=\"baer\">{{cite book| first = John W. | last = Baer | title = The Pledge of Allegiance: A Revised History and Analysis, 1892\u20132007 | year = 2007 | publisher = Avrio Knowledge Group}}</ref>\n<ref name=\"barry\">{{cite book|last1=Barry|first1=Vincent|title=Bioethics in a Cultural Context|date=2011|publisher=Cengage Learning|isbn=9780495814085|pages=192 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Ie0XO1aKVSsC}}</ref>\n<ref name=\"bdc\">{{cite web |title=CIS&nbsp;\u2013 Building the Domestic Church Series |url=http://www.kofc.org/en/domestic-church/parish-programs/cis.html |publisher=Knights of Columbus |access-date=15 March 2018}}</ref>\n<ref name=\"cali\">{{cite journal|last1=Gatter|first1=Mary|last2=Kimport|first2=Katrina|last3=Foster|first3=Diana Greene|last4=Weitz|first4=Tracy A.|last5=Upadhyay|first5=Ushma D.|title=Relationship Between Ultrasound Viewing and Proceeding to Abortion|journal=Obstetrics & Gynecology|volume=123|issue=1|year=2014|pages=81\u201387|issn=0029-7844|doi=10.1097/AOG.0000000000000053|pmid=24463667}}</ref>\n<ref name=\"canipe\">{{cite journal | url = https://heinonline.org/HOL/LandingPage?handle=hein.journals/jchs45&div=27&id=&page= | title = Under God and Anit-Communist: How the Pledge of Allegiance Got Religion in Cold War America | first = Lee | last = Canipe | journal = Journal of Church and State | volume =45 | issue = Spring 2003 | pages = 305\u2013323 | year = 2003 | doi = 10.1093/jcs/45.2.305}}</ref>\n<ref name=\"coflife\">{{cite web |title=Culture of Life |url=http://www.kofc.org/en/liberty-life-family/culture-of-life.html |access-date=12 March 2018}}</ref>\n<ref name=\"columbia\">{{cite magazine | title = A Growing Legacy | date = April 2012 | magazine = Columbia | page = 2 | volume = 92 | number = 8}}</ref>\n<ref name=\"conn\">{{cite news | title = Conn.

concerns any involvement of the [[Knights of Columbus]], a Catholic [[fraternal and service organizations|fraternal service organization]], to try to influence public and government policy.\n\nDuring the 20th century and especially the [[Cold War]], the order had a history of anti-anarchist, anti-socialist and [[anti-communism|anti-communist]] crusades.{{sfn|Kauffman|1982|pp=364\u2013365}} It also established the Commission on Religious Prejudices and the Knights of Columbus Historical Commission to combat racism.{{sfn|Kauffman|1982|pp=366\u2013367}} It was supportive of [[trade unionism]] and published the works of men including [[George Ernest Schuster|George Schuster]], [[Samuel Flagg Bemis]], [[Allan Nevins]], and [[W.&nbsp;E.&nbsp;B. Du Bois]].{{sfn|Kauffman|1982|pp=366\u2013367}}\n\nMore recently it has been active on social conservative issues, including [[opposition to same-sex marriage]], [[abortion]], [[divorce]], and [[birth control]], including requiring employers to provide it in violation of their religious beliefs. It has also been critical of the [[Immigration policy of Donald Trump|President Donald Trump's immigration policy]], and supportive of immigrants and refugees. Both in the United States and around the world, it has defended [[religious freedom]]. \n\n==Background==\nThe [[Knights of Columbus]] were active politically from an early date. In the years following the [[Second Vatican Council]], however, according to Christopher Kauffman, the Catholic anti-defamation character of the order began to diminish as Catholics became more accepted, and the leadership attempted to stimulate the membership to a greater awareness of the religious and moral issues confronting the Church. That led to the creation of a \"variety of new programs reflecting the proliferation of the new social ministries of the church\".{{sfn|Kauffman|1982}}\n\nIn December 2018, during the confirmation process of nominee [[Brian C. Buescher]] to the [[United States district court|U.S. District Court]], \"liberal\" Senator Mazie K. Hirono<ref name=\"Mazie Hirono on the Issues\">{{cite web |title=Mazie Hirono on the Issues |publisher=On the Issues |access-date=November 18, 2018 |url=http://www.ontheissues.org/house/Mazie_Hirono.htm }}]</ref> characterized the position the Knights of Columbus have taken on social issues as \"extreme\" and asked Buescher, \"If confirmed, do you intend to end your membership with this organization to avoid any appearance of bias?\"<ref name=jud>[https://www.judiciary.senate.gov/imo/media/doc/Buescher%20Responses%20to%20QFRs.pdf \"Nomination of Brian Buescher to the United States District Court for the District of Nebraska Questions for the Record December 5, 2018\", Judiciary.senate.gov.]</ref> Senator [[Kamala Harris]] also asked about opinions held by the organization and asked Buescher if he was aware these views when he joined the Knights of Columbus. Buescher replied that he was eighteen years old when he joined and did not recall if the Knights had at that time taken any position on those issues with which the Senator now disagreed.<ref name=jud/>\n\nWriting in the [[Los Angeles Times]], Rabbi Mitchell Rocklin said that the senators approach amounted to a \"religious test\" such as is precluded by Article VI of the Constitution. Rabbi Rocklin said: \"The line of questioning Buescher faced about his affiliation with the Knights of Columbus sets a troubling precedent of intolerance\u2014one that is unconscionable in principle and terrible in practice for people of all faiths who seek a role in public service. ...For centuries, many Jews have suffered a similar 'dual loyalty' smear: the anti-Semitic lie that, faced with a choice between country and religion, a Jewish public official will put his faith before his country.\"<ref name=Rocklin>[https://www.latimes.com/opinion/op-ed/la-oe-rocklin-brian-buescher-20190116-story.html Rocklin, Mitchell. \"Op-Ed: Keep religious tests out of the Senate\", ''Los Angeles Times'', January 16, 2019]</ref> Micklin noted the anti-Semitism experienced by Justices [[Louis Brandeis]] and [[Benjamin N. Cardozo]], and further state, \"It is even more absurd for senators to imply that a judge, who cannot propose or enact legislation, would be incapable of setting aside his religious beliefs when interpreting our written laws. ...If sitting lawmakers are allowed to make such assumptions of Catholic nominees, religious minorities could very well be next.\"<ref name=Rocklin/>\n==History==\n===War and peace issues===\n====World War I====\n[[File:See him through--Help us to help the boys.jpg|thumb|A Knights of Columbus poster from WWI]]\n\nOn April 14, 1917, soon after the United States entered [[World War I]], the board of directors passed a resolution calling \"for the active cooperation and patriotic zeal of 400,000 members of the order in this country to our Republic and its law, pledge their continued and unconditional support to the President and Congress of the Nation, in their determination to protect its honor and its ideals of humanity and right.\"{{sfn|Sweany|1923|p=2}}\n\nThe order also instituted a per capita tax on the membership to raise $1 million to provide for the welfare of the troops fighting in Europe.{{sfn|Sweany|1923|p=3}} Local councils undertook their own fundraising drives which resulted in an additional $14 million to support the effort.{{sfn|Sweany|1923|p=3}} Canadian knights took up the cause earlier, reflecting their earlier entry into the conflict.{{sfn|McGowan|1999|p=180}} It was said it was their \"finest hour\" as Catholics and as Canadians.{{sfn|McGowan|1999|p=180}}\n\nIn 1918, just before the war ended, the Knights and other organizations undertook another effort to raise funds to support the welfare of the troops both in the United States and overseas, which, along with the contribution of the National Catholic War Council, totaled $30 million.{{sfn|Sweany|1923|p=3}}\n\nStaff and chaplains were sent to all Army camps and [[cantonment]]<nowiki/>s.{{sfn|Sweany|1923|p=3}} A total of 260 buildings were erected and 1,134 secretaries, of which 1,075 were overseas, staffed them.{{sfn|Sweany|1923|p=3}} In Europe, headquarters were established in London and Paris.{{sfn|Sweany|1923|p=3}} The order's motto for this effort was \"Everyone welcome, everything free.\"{{sfn|Sweany|1923|p=3}}{{sfn|Scott|1919|pp=407\u2013408}} The order continued this work until November 1919, at which point the effort was taken over by the federal government.{{sfn|Sweany|1923|p=3}} The remaining $19 million was used to establish educational programs for returning servicemen.{{sfn|Sweany|1923|p=3}}\n\nAccording to Supreme Knight Flaherty, \"The war provided us with an opportunity to put ourselves before the public in a most favorable light.\"{{sfn|Dumenil|1991|p=23}} In Canada, it was an opportunity for Knights to show that in addition to being Catholic, they were also loyal Canadians.{{sfn|McGowan|1999|p=180}}\n\n===Cristero War===\nFollowing the [[Mexican Revolution]], the new government began persecuting the church. To destroy the church's influence over the Mexican people, anti-clerical statutes were inserted into the Constitution, beginning a 10-year persecution of Catholics that resulted in the deaths of thousands, including [[List of Knights of Columbus#Saints|several priests who were also Knights of Columbus]]. Leaders of the order began speaking out against the Mexican government. ''Columbia'', the official magazine of the Knights, published articles critical of the regime. After the November 1926 cover of ''Columbia'' portrayed Knights carrying a banner of liberty and warning of \"The Red Peril of Mexico,\" the Mexican legislature banned both the order and the magazine throughout the country.<ref name=\"Pelowski\" />\n\nIn 1926, the Massachusetts State Council passed a resolution opposing the Mexican government and in defense of human rights.{{sfn|Lapomarda|1992|p=37}} Ten days later, State Deputy [[Edmund J. Brandon]] sent a telegram to President [[Calvin Coolidge]] and Secretary of State [[Frank B. Kellogg]] opposing the deportation of a Mexican archbishop.{{sfn|Lapomarda|1992|p=37}} That same year, a delegation of Supreme Council officers met with President Coolidge to share with him their concerns about the persecution of Catholics in Mexico.\n\nThe order subsequently smuggled into Mexico pamphlets in English and Spanish denouncing the anticlerical Mexican government and its policies,<ref name=\"legacy\" /> provoking efforts at the border to stop the flow.{{sfn|Young|2015|pp=108\u2013109}}<ref name=\"king\" /> Twenty-five [[Saints of the Cristero War|martyrs from the conflict]] would eventually be canonized, including six Knights.<ref name=\"martyr\" />{{sfn|Meyer|1976}}\n\nSupreme Treasurer Daniel J. Callahan persuaded Senator [[William E. Borah]] to launch an investigation in 1935 into human rights violations in Mexico.{{sfn|Kauffman|1982|pp=301\u2013302}} Pope [[Pius XI]] in his encyclical ''[[Iniquis afflictisque]]'' praised the Knights' efforts.<ref name=\"columbia\" />\n\n===Spanish Civil War===\nDuring the [[Spanish Civil War]], the Church in America supported General [[Francisco Franco]] and the other rebels.{{sfn|Crosby|p=95|1971}} The Knights, and other Catholic groups, took the same stance.{{sfn|Crosby|p=95|1971}} When a group of American intellectuals formed the Board of Guardians for Basque Refugee Children and proposed shipping children from Spain to the United States, the Knights with others opposed the plan.{{sfn|Crosby|p=97|1971}} They appealed to President [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]] to keep the children with their families in France, though they were ready to assist those coming to the United States.{{sfn|Crosby|p=97|1971}}\n\nThe Knights supported the embargo on all arms into Spain,<ref name=\"Tierney2007\" /> and appealed to  [[Will H.
