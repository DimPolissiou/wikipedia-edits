After retiring from competition swimming, he became a lawyer in [[California]] and, after becoming a naturalized American, he was appointed a [[United States federal judge|United States District Judge]] of the [[United States District Court for the Central District of California]] by President [[Ronald Reagan]] in 1986, and presided over the trial of the [[Los Angeles Police Department]] officers charged with assaulting [[Rodney King]].<ref name=\"auto2\"/>\n\n==Swimming career==\nDavies entered and won both breaststroke events at the 1946 [[New South Wales]] Championships held at [[Manly, New South Wales|Manly]]. He began to train under [[Forbes Carlile]] in 1947 and won the 220yd breaststroke at the Australian Championships, as well as helping New South Wales to win the 3x110yd [[medley swimming|medley]] relay. He repeated these victories at the 1948 Australian Championships, earning selection to the [[1948 Summer Olympics]] in [[London]] at the age of 19. In the lead up to the Games, he won two races in London. Davies came in second in his heat and fourth in his semifinal with an Australian record 2m 44.8s to qualify for the final of the 200m breaststroke. Davies set a new Australian record in the final, recording a time of 2m 43.7s.<ref>Page 124 1948 US Olympic Book-Report of the US Olympic Committee</ref>\n\nAfter the Games, Davies enrolled at the [[University of Michigan]] in [[Ann Arbor]], [[Michigan]], where he trained under the guidance of coach [[Matthew Mann|Matt Mann]] and became a two time [[All-America|All American]].<ref>Page 11 University of Michigan Swimming & Diving Record Book</ref> Without scholarship support being available for swimmers during that era, he pursued a [[political science]] degree, while supporting himself by washing dishes and working at the International Student Centre. Mann also altered Davies's style, changing from the even-paced racing of Carlile to an early-attack oriented style of swimming. Davies managed a second placing at the 200yd breaststroke at the [[NCAA]] Championships in 1948 but failed to place in 1949 and 1950. In 1951 he won the 200m breaststroke at the AAU National Outdoor Championships and in 1952 won the 200yd breaststroke short course at the [[NCAA]] Championships setting a new world record of 2:21.9<ref name=\"auto1\"/> and the 200m Breaststroke AAU National Indoor Championship. The [[Australian Olympic Federation]] granted him an exemption from the Australian Championships and selected him for the [[1952 Summer Olympics]] in Helsinki. He trained with fellow team member [[John Marshall (swimmer)|John Marshall]] at [[Yale University]] under coach [[Robert Kiphuth]] while the rest of the Australian team trained in [[Townsville]].\n\nDavies arrived in Helsinki as the favourite after setting the 200-yard breaststroke (short course) world record<ref name=\"auto1\"/> earlier in the year, but after a poor time trial a week before the Games, he was forced to restrict his training to under a kilometre per day and sleep for 20 hours daily. Davies was not the fastest qualifier in the heats but broke the Olympic record set by [[Jerry Holan]] in the prelims.  Swimming in his even-paced style, Davies trailed by more than 2 seconds at the 100m mark, but overhauled his rivals, pipping the United States' [[Bowen Stassforth]] by 0.3s to reset his new Olympic record and tie the existing world record (long course) time of 2m 34.4s set by [[Herbert Klein (swimmer)|Herbert Klein]] of Germany who was third.<ref>[http://www.spiegel.de/spiegel/print/d-21977131.html ''Es fehlt noch die Goldmedaille''] in [[Spiegel Online]]</ref><ref>Page 129 1952 US Olympic Book-Report of the US Olympic Committee</ref> Davies, Stassforth, and Klein were the only three swimmers to better 2:35 in history in the 200 m breaststroke (long course) prior to the bifurcation of the stroke in 1953.\n\n== Legal career ==\nOn 22 April 1986, Davies was nominated by [[President of the United States|U.S. president]] [[Ronald Reagan]] to a seat on the [[United States District Court for the Central District of California]] vacated by [[Cynthia Holcomb Hall]]. Davies was [[advice and consent|confirmed]] by the [[United States Senate]] on 6 June 1986, and received his commission on 9 June 1986.<ref name=\"fjc.gov\">{{cite web|url=https://www.fjc.gov/history/judges/davies-john-g.|title=Davies, John G. \u2013 Federal Judicial Center|website=www.fjc.gov}}</ref> Retired U.S. District Court Judge [[Robert C. Bonner]] said of his former colleague: \u201cHe was one of the best federal judges ever to serve, and to my knowledge the only Olympics gold medalist to become a federal judge. In my view, he was \u2018the Judge who saved L.A. with his superb handling of the federal civil rights trial of the police who beat Rodney King. We have lost a great judge and a good friend.  He was also a masterful trial lawyer before his appointment to the bench.\u201d<ref name=\"auto2\"/>\n\n==Honours==\nDavies was inducted into the [[International Swimming Hall of Fame]] in 1984,<ref name=ishofprofile>International Swimming Hall of Fame, Honorees, [http://www.ishof.org/john-davies.html  John Davies (AUS)].  Retrieved 16 March 2015.</ref> and the [[Sport Australia Hall of Fame]] in 1992.

FINA recognized only one world record for the 200-meter breaststroke.  The 1952 US Olympic Book lists the 200-meter breaststroke world record as belonging to [[Herbert Klein (swimmer)|Herbert Klein]] with a time of 2:27.3 who swam it in a short course pool. If records were measured as they are today in long and short course pools, Davies tied [[Herbert Klein (swimmer)|Herbert Klein]]'s long course world record of 2:34.4 for the 200-meter breaststroke set on August 13, 1950, in G\u00f6ppingen, Germany at their 1952 Olympic final.<ref>[http://www.spiegel.de/spiegel/print/d-21977131.html ''Es fehlt noch die Goldmedaille''] in [[Spiegel Online]]</ref>\n\n\n==See also==\n* [[List of members of the International Swimming Hall of Fame]]\n* [[List of Olympic medalists in swimming (men)]]\n* [[World record progression 200 metres breaststroke]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==Sources==\n* {{cite book | last = Andrews | first = Malcolm | year = 2000 | title = Australia at the Olympic Games|publisher=[[Australian Broadcasting Corporation|ABC Books]] |isbn=0-7333-0884-8 |location=Sydney, New South Wales |pages=124\u2013125}}\n* {{cite book | last = Howell | first = Max | year = 1986 | title = Aussie Gold|publisher=[[Brooks Waterloo]] |isbn=0-86440-680-0 |location=Albion, Queensland |pages=66\u201368}}\n* Wallechinsky, David and Jaime Loucky (2008). \"Swimming (Men): 200-Meter Breaststroke\".

After retiring from competition swimming, he became a lawyer in [[California]] and, after becoming a naturalized American, he was appointed a [[United States federal judge|United States District Judge]] of the [[United States District Court for the Central District of California]] by President [[Ronald Reagan]] in 1986, and presided over the trial of the [[Los Angeles Police Department]] officers charged with assaulting [[Rodney King]].<ref name=\"auto2\"/>\n\n==Swimming career==\nDavies entered and won both breaststroke events at the 1946 [[New South Wales]] Championships held at [[Manly, New South Wales|Manly]]. He began to train under [[Forbes Carlile]] in 1947 and won the 220yd breaststroke at the Australian Championships, as well as helping New South Wales to win the 3x110yd [[medley swimming|medley]] relay. He repeated these victories at the 1948 Australian Championships, earning selection to the [[1948 Summer Olympics]] in [[London]] at the age of 19. In the lead up to the Games, he won two races in London. Davies came in second in his heat and fourth in his semifinal with an Australian record 2m 44.8s to qualify for the final of the 200m breaststroke. Davies set a new Australian record in the final, recording a time of 2m 43.7s.<ref>Page 124 1948 US Olympic Book-Report of the US Olympic Committee</ref>\n\nAfter the Games, Davies enrolled at the [[University of Michigan]] in [[Ann Arbor]], [[Michigan]], where he trained under the guidance of coach [[Matthew Mann|Matt Mann]] and became a two time [[All American]].<ref>Page 11 University of Michigan Swimming & Diving Record Book</ref> Without scholarship support being available for swimmers during that era, he pursued a [[political science]] degree, while supporting himself by washing dishes and working at the International Student Centre. Mann also altered Davies's style, changing from the even-paced racing of Carlile to an early-attack oriented style of swimming. Davies managed a second placing at the 200yd breaststroke at the [[NCAA]] Championships in 1948 but failed to place in 1949 and 1950. In 1951 he won the 200m breaststroke at the AAU National Outdoor Championships and in 1952 won the 200yd breaststroke short course at the [[NCAA]] Championships setting a new world record of 2:21.9<ref name=\"auto1\"/> and the 200m Breaststroke AAU National Indoor Championship. The [[Australian Olympic Federation]] granted him an exemption from the Australian Championships and selected him for the [[1952 Summer Olympics]] in Helsinki. He trained with fellow team member [[John Marshall (swimmer)|John Marshall]] at [[Yale University]] under coach [[Robert Kiphuth]] while the rest of the Australian team trained in [[Townsville]].\n\nDavies arrived in Helsinki as the favourite after setting the 200-yard breaststroke (short course) world record<ref name=\"auto1\"/> earlier in the year, but after a poor time trial a week before the Games, he was forced to restrict his training to under a kilometre per day and sleep for 20 hours daily. Davies was not the fastest qualifier in the heats but broke the Olympic record set by [[Jerry Holan]] in the prelims.  Swimming in his even-paced style, Davies trailed by more than 2 seconds at the 100m mark, but overhauled his rivals, pipping the United States' [[Bowen Stassforth]] by 0.3s to reset his new Olympic record and tie the existing world record (long course) time of 2m 34.4s set by [[Herbert Klein (swimmer)|Herbert Klein]] of Germany who was third.<ref>[http://www.spiegel.de/spiegel/print/d-21977131.html ''Es fehlt noch die Goldmedaille''] in [[Spiegel Online]]</ref><ref>Page 129 1952 US Olympic Book-Report of the US Olympic Committee</ref> Davies, Stassforth, and Klein were the only three swimmers to better 2:35 in history in the 200 m breaststroke (long course) prior to the bifurcation of the stroke in 1953.\n\n== Legal career ==\nOn 22 April 1986, Davies was nominated by [[President of the United States|U.S. president]] [[Ronald Reagan]] to a seat on the [[United States District Court for the Central District of California]] vacated by [[Cynthia Holcomb Hall]]. Davies was [[advice and consent|confirmed]] by the [[United States Senate]] on 6 June 1986, and received his commission on 9 June 1986.<ref name=\"fjc.gov\">{{cite web|url=https://www.fjc.gov/history/judges/davies-john-g.|title=Davies, John G. \u2013 Federal Judicial Center|website=www.fjc.gov}}</ref> Retired U.S. District Court Judge [[Robert C.

In my view, he was \u2018the Judge who saved L.A. with his superb handling of the federal civil rights trial of the police who beat Rodney King. We have lost a great judge and a good friend.  He was also a masterful trial lawyer before his appointment to the bench.\u201d<ref name=\"auto2\"/>\n\n==Honours==\nDavies was inducted into the [[International Swimming Hall of Fame]] in 1984,<ref name=ishofprofile>International Swimming Hall of Fame, Honorees, [http://www.ishof.org/john-davies.html  John Davies (AUS)].  Retrieved 16 March 2015.</ref> and the [[Sport Australia Hall of Fame]] in 1992.

FINA recognized only one world record for the 200-meter breaststroke.  The 1952 US Olympic Book lists the 200-meter breaststroke world record as belonging to [[Herbert Klein (swimmer)|Herbert Klein]] with a time of 2:27.3 who swam it in a short course pool. If records were measured as they are today in long and short course pools, Davies tied [[Herbert Klein (swimmer)|Herbert Klein]]'s long course world record of 2:34.4 for the 200-meter breaststroke set on August 13, 1950, in G\u00f6ppingen, Germany at their 1952 Olympic final.<ref>[http://www.spiegel.de/spiegel/print/d-21977131.html ''Es fehlt noch die Goldmedaille''] in [[Spiegel Online]]</ref>\n\n\n==See also==\n* [[List of members of the International Swimming Hall of Fame]]\n* [[List of Olympic medalists in swimming (men)]]\n* [[World record progression 200 metres breaststroke]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==Sources==\n* {{cite book | last = Andrews | first = Malcolm | year = 2000 | title = Australia at the Olympic Games|publisher=[[Australian Broadcasting Corporation|ABC Books]] |isbn=0-7333-0884-8 |location=Sydney, New South Wales |pages=124\u2013125}}\n* {{cite book | last = Howell | first = Max | year = 1986 | title = Aussie Gold|publisher=[[Brooks Waterloo]] |isbn=0-86440-680-0 |location=Albion, Queensland |pages=66\u201368}}\n* Wallechinsky, David and Jaime Loucky (2008). \"Swimming (Men): 200-Meter Breaststroke\".

The city came under national spotlight again in 1917, when Prime Minister [[Duan Qirui]]'s abrogation of the constitution triggered the [[Constitutional Protection Movement]]. [[Sun Yat-sen]] came to head the [[Constitutional Protection Junta|Guangzhou Military Government]] supported by the members of the dissolved parliament and the Southwestern warlords. The Guangzhou government fell apart as the warlords withdrew their support. Sun fled to [[Shanghai International Settlement|Shanghai]] in November 1918 until the Guangdong warlord [[Chen Jiongming]] restored him in October 1920 during the [[Yuegui Wars]].{{sfnp|Beck|2007}} On 16 June 1922, Sun was ousted in a coup and fled on the warship [[SS Zhongshan|Yongfeng]] after Chen sided with the [[Zhili Clique]]'s [[Beiyang government|Beijing government]]. In the following months Sun mounted a counterattack into Guangdong by rallying supporters from Yunnan and Guangxi, and in January established [[Government of the Republic of China in Guangzhou|a government]] in the city for the third time.\n\n[[File:Naval Jack of the Republic of China.svg|thumb|left|upright=.9|Flag of [[Kuomintang]]]]\nFrom 1923 to 1926 Sun and the Kuomintang [[Army and Navy Marshal stronghold of the Republic of China|used the city as a base]] to prosecute a renewed revolution in China by conquering the warlords in the north.  Although Sun was previously dependent on opportunistic warlords who hosted him in the city, with the leadership of Chiang Kai-shek, the KMT developed its own military power to serve its ambition. The Canton years saw the evolution of the KMT into a revolutionary movement with a strong military focus and ideological commitment, setting the tone of the KMT rule of China beyond 1927.\n\nIn 1924 the KMT made the momentous decision to ally with the Communist Party and the USSR. With Soviet help, KMT reorganized itself along the Leninist line and adopted a pro-labor and pro-peasant stance. The [[First United Front|Kuomintang-CCP cooperation]] was confirmed in the [[1st National Congress of Kuomintang|First Congress of the KMT]] and the communists were instructed to join the KMT. The allied government set up the [[Peasant Movement Training Institute]] in the city, of which Mao Zedong was a director for one term. Sun and his military commander Chiang used [[USSR|Soviet]] funds and weapons to build an armed force staffed by communist commissars, training its cadres in the [[Whampoa Military Academy]].{{sfnp|Beck|2007}} In August, the fledgling army suppressed the [[Canton Merchants' Corps Uprising]]. The next year the anti-imperialist [[May Thirtieth Movement]] swept the country, and the KMT government called for strikes in Canton and Hong Kong. The tensions of the massive strikes and protests led to the [[Shakee Massacre]].\n\nAfter the death of Sun Yat-sen in 1925 the mood was changing in the party toward the communists. In August the left-wing KMT leader [[Liao Zhongkai]] was assassinated and the right-wing leader [[Hu Hanmin]], the suspected mastermind, was exiled to the Soviet Union, leaving the pro-communist [[Wang Jingwei]] in charge. Opposing communist encroachment, the right-wing [[Western Hills Group]] vowed to expel the communists from the KMT. The \"[[Canton Coup]]\" on 20 March 1926 saw Chiang solidify his control over the [[KMT|Nationalists]] and [[National Revolutionary Army|their army]] against [[Wang Jingwei]], the party's left wing, its [[Chinese Communist Party|Communist]] allies, and its [[USSR|Soviet]] advisors.<ref>{{citation |last=Van de Ven |first=Hans |date=2003 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=tx5H_DC5V-MC |title=War and Nationalism in China: 1925\u20131945 |series=Studies in the Modern History of Asia |publisher=RoutledgeCurzon |location=London |isbn=978-0-415-14571-8 |pp=[https://books.google.com/books?id=tx5H_DC5V-MC&pg=PA101 101 ff] |access-date=2017-08-31 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170225071802/https://books.google.com/books?id=tx5H_DC5V-MC |archive-date=2017-02-25 |url-status=live }}</ref><ref name=AhXiang1998>{{citation |author=Ah Xiang |contribution-url=http://www.republicanchina.org/Zhongshan-Warship-Incident.pdf |contribution=The ''Zhongshan'' Warship Incident |title=Tragedy of Chinese Revolution |date=1998}}</ref> By May, he had ended civilian control of the military<ref name=AhXiang1998/> and begun his [[Northern Expedition (1926\u20131927)|Northern Expedition]] against the [[Warlord Era|warlords]] of the north. Its success led to the split of the KMT between Wuhan and Nanking and the purge of the communists in the [[Shanghai Massacre]]. Immediately afterwards Canton joined the purge under the auspice of [[Li Jishen]], resulting in the arrest of communists and the suspension of left wing KMT apparatuses and labor groups. Later in 1927 when [[Zhang Fakui]], a general supportive of the Wuhan faction seized Canton and installed Wang Jingwei's faction in the city, the communists saw an opening and launched the [[Guangzhou Uprising]]. Prominent communist military leaders [[Ye Ting]] and [[Ye Jianying]] led the failed defense of the city. Soon, control of the city reverted to [[Li Jishen]].\n\nLi was deposed in the War between Chiang and Guangxi Clique. By 1929, [[Chen Jitang]] had established himself as the powerholder of Guangdong. In 1931 he threw his weight behind the anti-Chiang schism by hosting a separate Nationalist government in Guangzhou.<ref>\u674e\u6d01\u4e4b\uff0c\u9648\u6d4e\u68e0\u4e3b\u7ca4\u59cb\u672b\uff0c\u300a\u5e7f\u5dde\u6587\u53f2\u300b\u7b2c\u4e09\u5341\u4e03\u8f91\u3002</ref> Opposing Chiang's alleged dictatorship, the separatists included KMT leaders like [[Wang Jingwei]], [[Sun Fo]] and others from diverse factions. The peace negotiations amidst the armed stand-off led to the [[4th National Congress of Kuomintang]] being held separately by three factions in Nanjing, Shanghai and Canton. Resigning all his posts, Chiang pulled off a political compromise that reunited all factions. While the intraparty division was resolved, Chen kept his power until he was defeated by Chiang in 1936.\n\nDuring [[Second Sino-Japanese War|World War II]], the \"[[Canton Operation]]\" subjected the city to [[Empire of Japan|Japanese]] occupation by the end of December 1938.\n\n==== People's Republic of China ====\nAmid the closing months of the [[Chinese Civil War]], Guangzhou briefly served as the capital of the [[Republic of China (1912\u20131949)|Republic of China]] after the taking of [[Nanjing]] by the PLA in April 1949. The [[People's Liberation Army]] entered the city on 14 October 1949. Amid a massive exodus to [[Hong Kong]] and [[Colonial Macau|Macau]], the [[KMT|Nationalists]] blew up the [[Haizhu Bridge]] across the Pearl River in retreat. The Cultural Revolution had a large effect on the city with much of its temples, churches and other monuments destroyed during this chaotic period.\n\nThe [[China|People's Republic of China]] initiated building projects including new housing on the banks of the Pearl River to adjust the city's [[Tanka people|boat people]] to life on land. Since the 1980s, the city's close proximity to [[Hong Kong]] and [[Shenzhen]] and its ties to [[overseas Chinese]] have made it one of the first beneficiaries of China's [[opening up policy|opening up]] under [[Deng Xiaoping]]. Beneficial tax reforms in the 1990s have also helped the city's industrialisation and development.\n\nThe municipality was expanded in the year 2000, with [[Huadu District|Huadu]] and [[Panyu District|Panyu]] joining the city as [[district (China)|urban districts]] and [[Conghua]] and [[Zengcheng]] as more rural [[county (China)|counties]]. The former districts of [[Dongshan District, Guangzhou|Dongshan]] and [[Fangcun District|Fangcun]] were abolished in 2005, merged into [[Yuexiu District|Yuexiu]] and [[Liwan District|Liwan]] respectively. The city acquired [[Nansha District|Nansha]] and [[Luogang District|Luogang]]. The former was carved out of [[Panyu District|Panyu]], the latter from parts of [[Baiyun District, Guangzhou|Baiyun]], [[Tianhe District|Tianhe]], [[Zengcheng]], and an exclave within [[Huangpu District, Guangzhou|Huangpu]].

The Baozhuangyan is now known as the [[Temple of the Six Banyan Trees]], after a famous poem composed by [[Su Shi]] after a visit during the [[Northern Song dynasty|Northern Song]].{{citation needed|date=July 2018}} The Xilai Monastery was renamed the [[Hualin Temple (Guangzhou)|Hualin Temple]] (\"Flowery Forest Temple\") after its reconstruction during the [[Qing Dynasty|Qing]].\n\nThe temples were damaged by both the [[Republic of China|Republican]] campaign to \"Promote Education with Temple Property\" ({{lang|zh|{{linktext|\u5edf|\u7522|\u8208|\u5b78}}}}) and the [[Maoism|Maoist]] [[Cultural Revolution]] but have been renovated since the [[opening up policy|opening up]] that began in the 1980s. The Ocean Banner Temple on [[Henan Island]], once famous in the west as the only tourist spot in Guangzhou accessible to foreigners, has been reopened as the [[Hoi Tong Monastery]].\n\n==== Christianity ====\n[[Nestorianism|Nestorian]] [[Christianity in China|Christians]] first arrived in China via the overland [[Silk Road]], but suffered during [[Emperor Wuzong of Tang|Emperor Wuzong]]'s 845 [[Great Anti-Buddhist Persecution|persecution]] and were essentially extinct by the year 1000.<ref>{{cite book|last=Keung|title=Ching Feng|page=235}}</ref>{{Specify|reason=No mention of Nestorianism in Guangzhou|date=October 2019}} The [[Qing dynasty|Qing]]-era ban on foreigners limited [[Christian mission|missionaries]] until it [[Treaty of Nanking|was abolished]] following the [[First Opium War]], although the [[Protestantism in China|Protestant]] [[Robert Morrison (missionary)|Robert Morrison]] was able to perform some work through his service with the British factory. The [[Roman Catholic Church|Catholic]] [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Guangzhou|Archdiocese of Guangzhou]] is housed at [[Guangzhou's Sacred Heart Cathedral]], known locally as the \"Stone House\". A [[Gothic Revival architecture|Gothic Revival]] edifice which was built by hand from 1861 to 1888 under [[Second French Empire|French]] direction, its original Latin and French [[stained-glass window]]s were destroyed during the wars and amid the [[Cultural Revolution]]; they have since been replaced by English ones. The Canton Christian College (1888) and Hackett Medical College for Women (1902) were both founded by missionaries and now form part of Guangzhou's [[Lingnan University (Guangzhou)|Lingnan]]. Since the opening up of China in the 1980s, there has been renewed interest in Christianity, but Guangzhou maintains pressure on underground churches which avoid registration with government officials.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.asianews.it/news-en/Beijing-and-Guangzhou-attack-underground-Churches-21186.html |title=CHINA Beijing and Guangzhou attack underground Churches \u2013 Asia News |publisher=Asianews.it |access-date=2011-08-28 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110612140825/http://www.asianews.it/news-en/Beijing-and-Guangzhou-attack-underground-Churches-21186.html |archive-date=2011-06-12 }}</ref> The Catholic archbishop [[Dominic Tang]] was imprisoned without trial for 22 years, but his present successor is recognised by both the [[Vatican City|Vatican]] and China's [[Chinese Patriotic Catholic Association|Patriotic Church]].\n\n==== Islam ====\nGuangzhou has had a Muslim community since very early in the history of [[Islam in China|Islam]]; the native or nativised adherents of the faith are known as the [[Hui people|Hui]].

Together they broadcast in more than a dozen channels. The primary language of both stations is [[Cantonese]]. Traditionally only one channel of Radio Guangdong is dedicated to [[Standard Mandarin|Mandarin Chinese]]. However, in recent years there has been an increase in Mandarin programmes on most Cantonese channels. Radio stations from cities around Guangzhou mainly broadcast in Cantonese and can be received in different parts of the city, depending on the radio stations' locations and transmission power. The Beijing-based [[China National Radio]] also broadcasts Mandarin programmes in the city. Radio Guangdong has a 30-minute weekly English programme, ''Guangdong Today'', which is broadcast globally through the [[WRN Broadcast|World Radio Network]]. Daily English news programmes are also broadcast by Radio Guangdong.\n\nGuangzhou has some of the best Chinese-language newspapers and magazines in [[mainland China]], most of which are published by three major newspaper groups in the city, the [[Guangzhou Daily]] Press Group, [[Southern Daily|Nanfang Press Corporation]], and the [[Yangcheng Evening News]] Group. The two leading newspapers of the city are ''[[Guangzhou Daily]]'' and ''[[Southern Metropolis Daily]]''. The former, with a circulation of 1.8 million, has been China's most successful newspaper for 14 years in terms of advertising revenue, while ''Southern Metropolis Daily'' is considered one of the most liberal newspapers in mainland China. In addition to Guangzhou's Chinese-language publications, there are a few English magazines and newspapers. The most successful is ''That's Guangzhou'', which started more than a decade ago and has since blossomed into ''[[That's PRD]]'', producing expatriate magazines in Beijing and Shanghai as well. It also produces ''In the Red''.\n\n{{anchor|Guangzhou Higher Education Mega Centre}}\n\n== Education ==\n[[File:North Square of SYSU.jpg|thumb|upright=.9|[[Sun Yat-sen University]] main gate]]\n[[File:\u4e2d\u5c71\u5927\u5b78\u4e2d\u5c71\u91ab\u5b78\u9662\u6b63\u95802006.JPG|thumb|upright=.9|The College of Medical Science at Sun Yat-sen University]]\n[[File:Guangzhou Library 2013.11.15 18-30-36.jpg|thumb|upright=.9|Guangzhou Library]]\nThe [[Guangzhou Higher Education Mega Center|Guangzhou Higher Education Mega Centre]], also known as Guangzhou University Town ({{lang|zh|{{linktext|\u5e7f\u5dde|\u5927\u5b66|\u57ce}}}}), is a large tertiary education complex located in the southeast suburbs of Guangzhou.

The city came under national spotlight again in 1917, when Prime Minister [[Duan Qirui]]'s abrogation of the constitution triggered the [[Constitutional Protection Movement]]. [[Sun Yat-sen]] came to head the [[Constitutional Protection Junta|Guangzhou Military Government]] supported by the members of the dissolved parliament and the Southwestern warlords. The Guangzhou government fell apart as the warlords withdrew their support. Sun fled to [[Shanghai International Settlement|Shanghai]] in November 1918 until the Guangdong warlord [[Chen Jiongming]] restored him in October 1920 during the [[Yuegui Wars]].{{sfnp|Beck|2007}} On 16 June 1922, Sun was ousted in a coup and fled on the warship [[SS Zhongshan|Yongfeng]] after Chen sided with the [[Zhili Clique]]'s [[Beiyang government|Beijing government]]. In the following months Sun mounted a counterattack into Guangdong by rallying supporters from Yunnan and Guangxi, and in January established [[Government of the Republic of China in Guangzhou|a government]] in the city for the third time.\n\n[[File:Naval Jack of the Republic of China.svg|thumb|left|upright=.9|Flag of [[Kuomintang]]]]\nFrom 1923 to 1926 Sun and the Kuomintang [[Army and Navy Marshal stronghold of the Republic of China|used the city as a base]] to prosecute a renewed revolution in China by conquering the warlords in the north.  Although Sun was previously dependent on opportunistic warlords who hosted him in the city, with the leadership of Chiang Kai-shek, the KMT developed its own military power to serve its ambition. The Canton years saw the evolution of the KMT into a revolutionary movement with a strong military focus and ideological commitment, setting the tone of the KMT rule of China beyond 1927.\n\nIn 1924 the KMT made the momentous decision to ally with the Communist Party and the USSR. With Soviet help, KMT reorganized itself along the Leninist line and adopted a pro-labor and pro-peasant stance. The [[First United Front|Kuomintang-CCP cooperation]] was confirmed in the [[1st National Congress of Kuomintang|First Congress of the KMT]] and the communists were instructed to join the KMT. The allied government set up the [[Peasant Movement Training Institute]] in the city, of which Mao Zedong was a director for one term. Sun and his military commander Chiang used [[USSR|Soviet]] funds and weapons to build an armed force staffed by communist commissars, training its cadres in the [[Whampoa Military Academy]].{{sfnp|Beck|2007}} In August, the fledgling army suppressed the [[Canton Merchants' Corps Uprising]]. The next year the anti-imperialist [[May Thirtieth Movement]] swept the country, and the KMT government called for strikes in Canton and Hong Kong. The tensions of the massive strikes and protests led to the [[Shakee Massacre]].\n\nAfter the death of Sun Yat-sen in 1925 the mood was changing in the party toward the communists. In August the left-wing KMT leader [[Liao Zhongkai]] was assassinated and the right-wing leader [[Hu Hanmin]], the suspected mastermind, was exiled to the Soviet Union, leaving the pro-communist [[Wang Jingwei]] in charge. Opposing communist encroachment, the right-wing [[Western Hills Group]] vowed to expel the communists from the KMT. The \"[[Canton Coup]]\" on 20 March 1926 saw Chiang solidify his control over the [[KMT|Nationalists]] and [[National Revolutionary Army|their army]] against [[Wang Jingwei]], the party's left wing, its [[Chinese Communist Party|Communist]] allies, and its [[USSR|Soviet]] advisors.<ref>{{citation |last=Van de Ven |first=Hans |date=2003 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=tx5H_DC5V-MC |title=War and Nationalism in China: 1925\u20131945 |series=Studies in the Modern History of Asia |publisher=RoutledgeCurzon |location=London |isbn=978-0-415-14571-8 |pp=[https://books.google.com/books?id=tx5H_DC5V-MC&pg=PA101 101 ff] |access-date=2017-08-31 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170225071802/https://books.google.com/books?id=tx5H_DC5V-MC |archive-date=2017-02-25 |url-status=live }}</ref><ref name=AhXiang1998>{{citation |author=Ah Xiang |contribution-url=http://www.republicanchina.org/Zhongshan-Warship-Incident.pdf |contribution=The ''Zhongshan'' Warship Incident |title=Tragedy of Chinese Revolution |date=1998}}</ref> By May, he had ended civilian control of the military<ref name=AhXiang1998/> and begun his [[Northern Expedition (1926\u20131927)|Northern Expedition]] against the [[Warlord Era|warlords]] of the north. Its success led to the split of the KMT between Wuhan and Nanking and the purge of the communists in the [[Shanghai Massacre]]. Immediately afterwards Canton joined the purge under the auspice of [[Li Jishen]], resulting in the arrest of communists and the suspension of left wing KMT apparatuses and labor groups. Later in 1927 when [[Zhang Fakui]], a general supportive of the Wuhan faction seized Canton and installed Wang Jingwei's faction in the city, the communists saw an opening and launched the [[Guangzhou Uprising]]. Prominent communist military leaders [[Ye Ting]] and [[Ye Jianying]] led the failed defense of the city. Soon, control of the city reverted to [[Li Jishen]].\n\nLi was deposed in the War between Chiang and Guangxi Clique. By 1929, [[Chen Jitang]] had established himself as the powerholder of Guangdong. In 1931 he threw his weight behind the anti-Chiang schism by hosting a separate Nationalist government in Guangzhou.<ref>\u674e\u6d01\u4e4b\uff0c\u9648\u6d4e\u68e0\u4e3b\u7ca4\u59cb\u672b\uff0c\u300a\u5e7f\u5dde\u6587\u53f2\u300b\u7b2c\u4e09\u5341\u4e03\u8f91\u3002</ref> Opposing Chiang's alleged dictatorship, the separatists included KMT leaders like [[Wang Jingwei]], [[Sun Fo]] and others from diverse factions. The peace negotiations amidst the armed stand-off led to the [[4th National Congress of Kuomintang]] being held separately by three factions in Nanjing, Shanghai and Canton. Resigning all his posts, Chiang pulled off a political compromise that reunited all factions. While the intraparty division was resolved, Chen kept his power until he was defeated by Chiang in 1936.\n\nDuring [[Second Sino-Japanese War|World War II]], the \"[[Canton Operation]]\" subjected the city to [[Empire of Japan|Japanese]] occupation by the end of December 1938.\n\n==== People's Republic of China ====\nAmid the closing months of the [[Chinese Civil War]], Guangzhou briefly served as the capital of the [[Republic of China (1912\u20131949)|Republic of China]] after the taking of [[Nanjing]] by the PLA in April 1949. The [[People's Liberation Army]] entered the city on 14 October 1949. Amid a massive exodus to [[Hong Kong]] and [[Colonial Macau|Macau]], the [[KMT|Nationalists]] blew up the [[Haizhu Bridge]] across the Pearl River in retreat. The Cultural Revolution had a large effect on the city with much of its temples, churches and other monuments destroyed during this chaotic period.\n\nThe [[China|People's Republic of China]] initiated building projects including new housing on the banks of the Pearl River to adjust the city's [[Tanka people|boat people]] to life on land. Since the 1980s, the city's close proximity to [[Hong Kong]] and [[Shenzhen]] and its ties to [[overseas Chinese]] have made it one of the first beneficiaries of China's [[opening up policy|opening up]] under [[Deng Xiaoping]]. Beneficial tax reforms in the 1990s have also helped the city's industrialisation and development.\n\nThe municipality was expanded in the year 2000, with [[Huadu District|Huadu]] and [[Panyu District|Panyu]] joining the city as [[district (China)|urban districts]] and [[Conghua]] and [[Zengcheng]] as more rural [[county (China)|counties]]. The former districts of [[Dongshan District, Guangzhou|Dongshan]] and [[Fangcun District|Fangcun]] were abolished in 2005, merged into [[Yuexiu District|Yuexiu]] and [[Liwan District|Liwan]] respectively. The city acquired [[Nansha District|Nansha]] and [[Luogang District|Luogang]]. The former was carved out of [[Panyu District|Panyu]], the latter from parts of [[Baiyun District, Guangzhou|Baiyun]], [[Tianhe District|Tianhe]], [[Zengcheng]], and an exclave within [[Huangpu District, Guangzhou|Huangpu]]. The [[National People's Congress]] approved a development plan for the [[Pearl River Delta]] in January 2009; on March 19 the same year, the Guangzhou and [[Foshan]] municipal governments agreed to establish a framework to merge the two cities.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://news.xinhuanet.com/newscenter/2009-03/19/content_11037051.htm |title=Guangzhou and Foshan signed \"City Merge Cooperation Framework\" |publisher=News.xinhuanet.com |access-date=2010-05-06 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090705135320/http://news.xinhuanet.com/newscenter/2009-03/19/content_11037051.htm |archive-date=2009-07-05 }}</ref> In 2014, [[Luogang District|Luogang]] merged into [[Huangpu District, Guangzhou|Huangpu]] and both [[Conghua District|Conghua]] and [[Zengcheng District|Zengcheng]] counties were upgraded to districts.\n\n== Gallery ==\n{{Clear}}\n<gallery mode=\"packed\" heights=\"150\">\nFile:Nieuhof-Ambassade-vers-la-Chine-1665 0744-2.tif|[[Johan Nieuhof|Nieuhof]]'s imaginative 1665 map of \"Kanton\",<ref>{{citation|last=La Carpentier|first=Jean-Baptiste|authorlink=Jean-Baptiste Le Carpentier|title=L'Ambassade de la Compagnie Orientale des Provinces Unies vers l'Empereur de la Chine ''[''Embassy of the United Provinces' East India Company to the Emperor of China'']''|date=1655|language=fr}}</ref> made from second-hand accounts while Europeans were still forbidden from entering the walled city\nFile:Canton factories.jpg|The [[Thirteen Factories]] {{c.|1805|lk=no}}, displaying the flags of [[Denmark-Norway|Denmark]], [[Enlightenment in Spain|Spain]], the United States, Sweden, [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland|Britain]], and the [[Prince's Flag|Netherlands]]\nFile:Shop of Tingqua, the painter.jpg|An 1855 painting of the gallery of Tingqua, one of the most successful suppliers of \"export paintings\" for Guangzhou's foreign traders.<br />Common themes included the [[Thirteen Factories]], the [[Whampoa Anchorage]] (now Pazhou), and the [[Sea-Banner Temple]] (now Hoi Tong Monastery)\nFile:Canton1860.jpg|[[Daniel Vrooman|Vrooman]]'s 1860 map of the \"City and Entire Suburbs of Canton\", one of the first made after the treaties of [[Treaty of Tianjin|Tianjin]] and [[Convention of Peking|Beijing]] permitted foreigners full access to Guangzhou's walled city\nFile:Flowery Pagoda.jpg|The [[Flowery Pagoda]] at the [[Temple of the Six Banyan Trees]] in 1863\nFile:Lai Afong, Five Stories Pagoda Guangzhou, c1880.JPG|The [[Five-storey Pagoda]] atop [[Yuexiu Hill]] {{c.|1880|lk=no}}\nFile:Lai Afong, Sacred Heart Cathedral Guangzhou, c1880.JPG|The [[Guangzhou's Sacred Heart Cathedral|Sacred Heart Cathedral]] towering over the one- and two-storey homes of old Guangzhou {{c.|1880|lk=no}}\nFile:Canton street scene, 1919.jpg|Street scene in Guangzhou, 1919\nFile:Canton1920 d006 map of of the city.jpg|The [[US Navy]]'s Dept of Navigation's 1920 map of \"Canton\"<ref>{{citation|url=https://archive.org/stream/cantonchina00unitrich#page/4/mode/2up|title=US Navy Ports of the World: Canton|publisher=US Bureau of Navigation|series=Ditty Box Guide Book Series|at=[https://archive.org/stream/cantonchina00unitrich#page/n5/mode/2up Canton]}}</ref>\nFile:Whampoa3.jpg|[[Sun Yat-sen]] and [[Chiang Kai-shek]] at the opening of the [[Whampoa Military Academy]] on 16 June 1924\nFile:The Bund Canton.jpg|The Guangzhou Bund in 1930, with rows of [[Tanka people|Tanka]] boats.\nFile:1937 Canton, China VP8.webm|A short film of Guangzhou in 1937\nFile:PLA Troops entered to Guangzhou.jpg|The [[People's Liberation Army]] entering Guangzhou on 14 October 1949\n</gallery>\n\n== Geography ==\n[[File:Txu-oclc-10552568-nf49-4.jpg|thumb|Map of Guangzhou (labeled as KUANG-CHOU (CANTON) {{lang|zh-hant|\u5ee3\u5dde}}) in surrounding region ([[Army Map Service|AMS]], 1954)]]\n[[File:Tiantang Peak.jpg|thumb|[[Tiantang Peak]], highest mountain in Guangzhou]]\nThe old town of Guangzhou was near [[Baiyun Mountain (Guangdong)|Baiyun Mountain]] on the east bank of the [[Pearl River (China)|Pearl River]] (Zhujiang) about {{convert|80|mi|0}} from its junction with the [[South China Sea]] and about {{convert|300|mi|0}} below its [[head of navigation]].{{sfnp|''EB''|1878|p=37}} It commanded the rich alluvial plain of the [[Pearl River Delta]], with its connection to the sea protected at the [[Humen Strait]].{{sfnp|''EB''|1878|p=37}} The present city spans {{convert|7434.4|sqkm|1}} on both sides of the river from {{nowrap|112\u00b0 57\u2032}} to {{nowrap|114\u00b0 03\u2032 E}} longitude and {{nowrap|22\u00b0 26\u2032}} to {{nowrap|23\u00b0 56\u2032 N}} latitude in south-central Guangdong.

Together they broadcast in more than a dozen channels. The primary language of both stations is [[Cantonese]]. Traditionally only one channel of Radio Guangdong is dedicated to [[Standard Mandarin|Mandarin Chinese]]. However, in recent years there has been an increase in Mandarin programmes on most Cantonese channels. Radio stations from cities around Guangzhou mainly broadcast in Cantonese and can be received in different parts of the city, depending on the radio stations' locations and transmission power. The Beijing-based [[China National Radio]] also broadcasts Mandarin programmes in the city. Radio Guangdong has a 30-minute weekly English programme, ''Guangdong Today'', which is broadcast globally through the [[WRN Broadcast|World Radio Network]]. Daily English news programmes are also broadcast by Radio Guangdong.\n\nGuangzhou has some of the best Chinese-language newspapers and magazines in [[mainland China]], most of which are published by three major newspaper groups in the city, the [[Guangzhou Daily]] Press Group, [[Southern Daily|Nanfang Press Corporation]], and the [[Yangcheng Evening News]] Group. The two leading newspapers of the city are ''[[Guangzhou Daily]]'' and ''[[Southern Metropolis Daily]]''. The former, with a circulation of 1.8 million, has been China's most successful newspaper for 14 years in terms of advertising revenue, while ''Southern Metropolis Daily'' is considered one of the most liberal newspapers in mainland China. In addition to Guangzhou's Chinese-language publications, there are a few English magazines and newspapers. The most successful is ''That's Guangzhou'', which started more than a decade ago and has since blossomed into ''[[That's PRD]]'', producing expatriate magazines in Beijing and Shanghai as well. It also produces ''In the Red''.\n\n{{anchor|Guangzhou Higher Education Mega Centre}}\n\n== Education ==\n[[File:North Square of SYSU.jpg|thumb|upright=.9|[[Sun Yat-sen University]] main gate]]\n[[File:\u4e2d\u5c71\u5927\u5b78\u4e2d\u5c71\u91ab\u5b78\u9662\u6b63\u95802006.JPG|thumb|upright=.9|The College of Medical Science at Sun Yat-sen University]]\n[[File:Guangzhou Library 2013.11.15 18-30-36.jpg|thumb|upright=.9|Guangzhou Library]]\nThe [[Guangzhou Higher Education Mega Center|Guangzhou Higher Education Mega Centre]], also known as Guangzhou University Town ({{lang|zh|{{linktext|\u5e7f\u5dde|\u5927\u5b66|\u57ce}}}}), is a large tertiary education complex located in the southeast suburbs of Guangzhou.
