Thus, it would give perceptions and \"feel\" very much like Earth daylight. The spectrum on the surface is slightly redder than that on Earth, due to scattering by reddish dust in the Martian atmosphere.\n\nFor comparison,  sunlight on Saturn is slightly brighter than Earth sunlight at the average sunset or sunrise (see [[daylight]] for comparison table). Even on Pluto, the sunlight would still be bright enough to almost match the average living room. To see sunlight as dim as full [[moonlight]] on Earth, a distance of about 500&nbsp;AU (~69&nbsp;[[light-hour]]s) is needed; only a handful of objects in the Solar System have been discovered that are known to orbit farther than such a distance, among them [[90377 Sedna]] and {{mpl|(87269) 2000 OO|67}}.\n\n== Surface illumination ==\n[[File:Sun_over_Lake_Hawea,_New_Zealand.jpg|thumb|300px|right|Sunlight shining through [[cloud]]s, giving rise to [[crepuscular rays]]]]\nThe spectrum of surface illumination depends upon solar elevation due to atmospheric effects, with the blue spectral component dominating during twilight before and after sunrise and sunset, respectively, and red dominating during sunrise and sunset. These effects are apparent in natural light [[photography]] where the principal source of illumination is sunlight as mediated by the atmosphere.\n\nWhile the color of the sky is usually determined by [[Rayleigh scattering]], an exception occurs at sunset and twilight. \"Preferential absorption of sunlight by ozone over long horizon paths gives the zenith sky its blueness when the sun is near the horizon\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://homepages.wmich.edu/%7Ekorista/atmospheric_optics.pdf|title=Atmospheric Optics|author=Craig Bohren|author-link=Craig Bohren|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131206175627/http://homepages.wmich.edu/%7Ekorista/atmospheric_optics.pdf|archive-date=2013-12-06|df=}}</ref>\n\nSee [[diffuse sky radiation]] for more details.\n\n=== Spectral composition of sunlight at Earth's surface ===\nThe Sun may be said to [[Lighting|illuminate]], which is a measure of the light within a specific sensitivity range.

When the direct radiation is not blocked by clouds, it is experienced as ''sunshine''. The warming of the ground (and other objects) depends on the [[absorption (electromagnetic radiation)|absorption of the electromagnetic radiation]] in the form of [[heat]].\n\nThe amount of radiation intercepted by a planetary body varies inversely with the square of the distance between the star and the planet. Earth's [[orbit]] and [[obliquity]] change with time (over thousands of years), sometimes forming a nearly perfect circle, and at other times stretching out to an [[orbital eccentricity]] of 5% (currently 1.67%). As the orbital eccentricity changes, the average distance from the Sun (the [[semimajor axis]] does not significantly vary, and so the total [[insolation]] over a year remains almost constant due to [[Kepler's second law]],\n:<math>\\tfrac{2A}{r^2}dt = d\\theta,</math>\n\nwhere <math>A</math> is the \"areal velocity\" invariant. That is, the integration over the orbital period (also invariant) is a constant.\n\n:<math>\\int_{0}^{T} \\tfrac{2A}{r^2}dt = \\int_{0}^{2\\pi} d\\theta = \\mathrm{constant}.</math>\n\nIf we assume the solar radiation power&nbsp;{{mvar|P}} as a constant over time and the solar irradiation given by the [[inverse-square law]], we obtain also the average insolation as a constant.\n\nBut the [[seasonal]] and latitudinal distribution and intensity of solar radiation received at Earth's surface does vary.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.museum.state.il.us/exhibits/ice_ages/insolation_graph.html |title=Graph of variation of seasonal and latitudinal distribution of solar radiation |publisher=Museum.state.il.us |date=2007-08-30 |access-date=2012-02-12 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120112043906/http://www.museum.state.il.us/exhibits/ice_ages/insolation_graph.html |archive-date=2012-01-12 |df= }}</ref> The [[effect of Sun angle on climate]] results in the change in solar energy in summer and winter.  For example, at [[latitude]]s of 65&nbsp;degrees, this can vary by more than 25% as a result of Earth's orbital variation. Because changes in winter and summer tend to offset, the change in the annual average insolation at any given location is near zero, but the redistribution of energy between summer and winter does strongly affect the intensity of seasonal cycles. Such changes associated with the redistribution of solar energy are considered a likely cause for the coming and going of recent [[ice age]]s (see: [[Milankovitch cycles]]).\n\n===Solar intensity variation===\n{{Further|Solar variation}}\nSpace-based observations of solar irradiance started in 1978. These measurements show that the solar constant is not constant. It varies on many time scales, including the 11-year sunspot solar cycle.<ref name=\"acrim\"/> When going further back in time, one has to rely on irradiance reconstructions, using sunspots for the past 400&nbsp;years or cosmogenic radionuclides for going back&nbsp;10,000 years.\nSuch reconstructions have been done.<ref>{{cite journal | title = Modeling the Sun's Magnetic Field and Irradiance since 1713 | last1 = Wang | display-authors = etal   | date = 2005 | url = | journal = The Astrophysical Journal | volume = 625 | issue = 1| pages = 522\u2013538 | doi = 10.1086/429689 | bibcode=2005ApJ...625..522W}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal | title = Total solar irradiance since 1996: is there a long-term variation unrelated to solar surface magnetic phenomena? | last1 = Steinhilber | display-authors = etal   | date = 2009 | url =https://www.dora.lib4ri.ch/eawag/islandora/object/eawag%3A6539/datastream/PDF/view | journal = Geophysical Research Letters | volume = 36 | issue = | page = L19704 | doi = 10.1051/0004-6361/200811446 | bibcode=2010A&A...523A..39S| doi-access = free }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal | title = Evolution of the solar irradiance during the Holocene | last1 = Vieira | display-authors = etal   | date = 2011 | url = | journal = Astronomy & Astrophysics | volume = 531 | issue = | page = A6 | doi = 10.1051/0004-6361/201015843 | bibcode=2011A&A...531A...6V|arxiv = 1103.4958 }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal | title = 9,400 years of cosmic radiation and solar activity from ice cores and tree rings | last1 = Steinhilber | display-authors = etal   | date = 2012 | journal = Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences | volume = 109| issue = 16| pages = 5967\u20135971| doi = 10.1073/pnas.1118965109 |bibcode = 2012PNAS..109.5967S | pmid=22474348 | pmc=3341045| url = http://epic.awi.de/30297/1/PNAS-2012-Steinhilber-1118965109.pdf}}</ref> These studies show that in addition to the solar irradiance variation with the solar cycle (the (Schwabe) cycle), the solar activity varies with longer cycles, such as the proposed 88 year ([[Gleisberg cycle]]), 208 year ([[DeVries cycle]]) and 1,000 year ([[Eddy cycle]]).\n\n==Life on Earth==\nThe existence of nearly all [[Organism|life on Earth]] is fueled by light from the Sun. Most [[autotroph]]s, such as plants, use the energy of sunlight, combined with carbon dioxide and water, to produce simple sugars\u2014a process known as [[photosynthesis]]. These sugars are then used as building-blocks and in other synthetic pathways that allow the organism to grow.\n\n[[Heterotroph]]s, such as animals, use light from the Sun indirectly by consuming the products of autotrophs, either by consuming autotrophs, by consuming their products, or by consuming other heterotrophs. The sugars and other molecular components produced by the autotrophs are then broken down, releasing stored solar energy, and giving the heterotroph the energy required for survival. This process is known as [[cellular respiration]].\n\nIn [[prehistory]], humans began to further extend this process by putting plant and animal materials to other uses. They used animal skins for warmth, for example, or wooden weapons to hunt. These skills allowed humans to harvest more of the sunlight than was possible through glycolysis alone, and human population began to grow.\n\nDuring the [[Neolithic Revolution]], the domestication of plants and animals further increased human access to solar energy. Fields devoted to crops were enriched by inedible plant matter, providing sugars and [[nutrients]] for future harvests. Animals that had previously provided humans with only meat and tools once they were killed were now used for labour throughout their lives, fueled by [[grasses]] inedible to humans.\n\nThe more recent discoveries of [[coal]], [[petroleum]] and [[natural gas]] are modern extensions of this trend. These [[fossil fuel]]s are the remnants of ancient plant and animal matter, formed using energy from sunlight and then trapped within Earth for millions of years. Because the stored energy in these fossil fuels has accumulated over many millions of years, they have allowed modern humans to massively increase the production and consumption of [[primary energy]]. As the amount of fossil fuel is large but finite, this cannot continue indefinitely, and various theories exist as to what will follow this stage of human civilization (e.g., [[alternative fuels]], [[Malthusian catastrophe]], [[new urbanism]], [[peak oil]]).\n\n==Cultural aspects==\n{{Unreferenced section|date=February 2011}}\n[[File:Edouard Manet - Luncheon on the Grass - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|upright=1.35|left|[[Eduard Manet]]: ''[[Le d\u00e9jeuner sur l'herbe]]'' (1862-63)]]\nThe effect of sunlight is relevant to [[painting]], evidenced for instance in works of [[Eduard Manet]] and [[Claude Monet]] on outdoor scenes and landscapes.\n[[File:Winter Sunshine.jpg|thumb|upright=1.35|right|''T\u00e9li ver\u0151f\u00e9ny'' (\"Winter Sunshine\") by [[L\u00e1szl\u00f3 Medny\u00e1nszky]], early 20th century]]\nMany people find direct sunlight to be too [[brightness|bright]] for comfort, especially when reading from white paper upon which the sunlight is directly shining. Indeed, looking directly at the Sun can cause long-term vision damage. To compensate for the brightness of sunlight, many people wear [[sunglasses]]. [[Automobile|Cars]], many [[helmet]]s and [[cap]]s are equipped with [[visor]]s to block the Sun from direct vision when the Sun is at a low angle. Sunshine is often blocked from entering buildings through the use of [[wall]]s, [[window blind]]s, [[awning]]s, [[Window shutter|shutters]], [[curtain]]s, or nearby [[shade tree]]s. Sunshine exposure is needed biologically for the creation of [[Vitamin D]] in the skin, a vital compound needed to make strong bone and muscle in the body.\n\nIn colder countries, many people prefer sunnier days and often avoid the [[Shade (shadow)|shade]]. In hotter countries, the converse is true; during the midday hours, many people prefer to stay inside to remain cool. If they do go outside, they seek shade that may be provided by trees, [[Umbrella|parasols]], and so on.\n\nIn many world religions, such as [[Hinduism]], the Sun is considered to be a god, as it is the source of life and energy on Earth. It also formed the basis for religion in [[Ancient Egypt]].\n\n===Sunbathing===<!-- This section is linked from [[Naturism]] -->\n{{main|Sun tanning}}\n{{Unreferenced section|date=January 2015}}\nSunbathing is a popular [[leisure]] activity in which a person sits or lies in direct sunshine. People often sunbathe in comfortable places where there is ample sunlight. Some common places for sunbathing include [[beach]]es, open air [[swimming pool]]s, [[park]]s, [[garden]]s, and [[sidewalk cafe]]s. Sunbathers typically wear limited amounts of clothing or some simply go [[Nudity|nude]]. For some, an alternative to sunbathing is the use of a [[Tanning bed|sunbed]] that generates [[ultraviolet]] light and can be used indoors regardless of weather conditions. Tanning beds have been banned in a number of states in the world.\n\nFor many people with light skin, one purpose for sunbathing is to darken one's [[Human skin color|skin color]] (get a sun tan), as this is considered in some cultures to be attractive, associated with outdoor activity, [[Vacation|vacations/holidays]], and health. Some people prefer [[Naturism|naked]] sunbathing so that an \"all-over\" or \"even\" tan can be obtained, sometimes as part of a specific lifestyle.\n\nControlled [[heliotherapy]], or sunbathing, has been used as a treatment for [[psoriasis]] and other maladies.\n\nSkin tanning is achieved by an increase in the dark pigment inside skin cells called [[melanocyte]]s, and is an automatic response mechanism of the body to sufficient exposure to ultraviolet radiation from the Sun or from artificial sunlamps.

To calculate the amount of sunlight reaching the ground, both the [[orbital eccentricity|eccentricity]] of Earth's [[elliptic orbit]] and the [[Extinction (astronomy)#Atmospheric extinction|attenuation]] by [[Earth's atmosphere]] have to be taken into account. The extraterrestrial solar illuminance ({{math|''E''<sub>ext</sub>}}), corrected for the elliptic orbit by using the day number of the year (dn), is given to a good approximation by<ref>{{cite journal|author=C.

The value of 0.033412 is determined knowing that the ratio between the perihelion (0.98328989&nbsp;AU) squared and the aphelion (1.01671033&nbsp;AU) squared should be approximately 0.935338.\n\nThe solar illuminance constant ({{math|''E''<sub>sc</sub>}}), is equal to 128\u00d710<sup>3</sup>&nbsp;[[lux]]. The direct normal illuminance ({{math|''E''<sub>dn</sub>}}), corrected for the attenuating effects of the atmosphere is given by:\n:<math>E_{\\rm dn}=E_{\\rm ext}\\,e^{-cm},</math>\nwhere {{mvar|c}} is the [[atmospheric extinction]] and {{mvar|m}} is the relative optical [[airmass]].

Thus, it would give perceptions and \"feel\" very much like Earth daylight. The spectrum on the surface is slightly redder than that on Earth, due to scattering by reddish dust in the Martian atmosphere.\n\nFor comparison,  sunlight on Saturn is slightly brighter than Earth sunlight at the average sunset or sunrise (see [[daylight]] for comparison table). Even on Pluto, the sunlight would still be bright enough to almost match the average living room. To see sunlight as dim as full [[moonlight]] on Earth, a distance of about 500&nbsp;AU (~69&nbsp;[[light-hour]]s) is needed; only a handful of objects in the Solar System have been discovered that are known to orbit farther than such a distance, among them [[90377 Sedna]] and {{mpl|(87269) 2000 OO|67}}.\n\n== Surface illumination ==\n[[File:Sun_over_Lake_Hawea,_New_Zealand.jpg|thumb|300px|right|Sunlight shining through [[cloud]]s, giving rise to [[crepuscular rays]]]]\nThe spectrum of surface illumination depends upon solar elevation due to atmospheric effects, with the blue spectral component dominating during twilight before and after sunrise and sunset, respectively, and red dominating during sunrise and sunset. These effects are apparent in natural light [[photography]] where the principal source of illumination is sunlight as mediated by the atmosphere.\n\nWhile the color of the sky is usually determined by [[Rayleigh scattering]], an exception occurs at sunset and twilight. \"Preferential absorption of sunlight by ozone over long horizon paths gives the zenith sky its blueness when the sun is near the horizon\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://homepages.wmich.edu/%7Ekorista/atmospheric_optics.pdf|title=Atmospheric Optics|author=Craig Bohren|author-link=Craig Bohren|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131206175627/http://homepages.wmich.edu/%7Ekorista/atmospheric_optics.pdf|archive-date=2013-12-06|df=}}</ref>\n\nSee [[diffuse sky radiation]] for more details.\n\n=== Spectral composition of sunlight at Earth's surface ===\nThe Sun may be said to [[Lighting|illuminate]], which is a measure of the light within a specific sensitivity range.

When the direct radiation is not blocked by clouds, it is experienced as ''sunshine''. The warming of the ground (and other objects) depends on the [[absorption (electromagnetic radiation)|absorption of the electromagnetic radiation]] in the form of [[heat]].\n\nThe amount of radiation intercepted by a planetary body varies inversely with the square of the distance between the star and the planet. Earth's [[orbit]] and [[obliquity]] change with time (over thousands of years), sometimes forming a nearly perfect circle, and at other times stretching out to an [[orbital eccentricity]] of 5% (currently 1.67%). As the orbital eccentricity changes, the average distance from the Sun (the [[semimajor axis]] does not significantly vary, and so the total [[insolation]] over a year remains almost constant due to [[Kepler's second law]],\n:<math>\\tfrac{2A}{r^2}dt = d\\theta,</math>\n\nwhere <math>A</math> is the \"areal velocity\" invariant. That is, the integration over the orbital period (also invariant) is a constant.\n\n:<math>\\int_{0}^{T} \\tfrac{2A}{r^2}dt = \\int_{0}^{2\\pi} d\\theta = \\mathrm{constant}.</math>\n\nIf we assume the solar radiation power&nbsp;{{mvar|P}} as a constant over time and the solar irradiation given by the [[inverse-square law]], we obtain also the average insolation as a constant.\n\nBut the [[seasonal]] and latitudinal distribution and intensity of solar radiation received at Earth's surface does vary.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.museum.state.il.us/exhibits/ice_ages/insolation_graph.html |title=Graph of variation of seasonal and latitudinal distribution of solar radiation |publisher=Museum.state.il.us |date=2007-08-30 |access-date=2012-02-12 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120112043906/http://www.museum.state.il.us/exhibits/ice_ages/insolation_graph.html |archive-date=2012-01-12 |df= }}</ref> The [[effect of Sun angle on climate]] results in the change in solar energy in summer and winter.  For example, at [[latitude]]s of 65&nbsp;degrees, this can vary by more than 25% as a result of Earth's orbital variation. Because changes in winter and summer tend to offset, the change in the annual average insolation at any given location is near zero, but the redistribution of energy between summer and winter does strongly affect the intensity of seasonal cycles. Such changes associated with the redistribution of solar energy are considered a likely cause for the coming and going of recent [[ice age]]s (see: [[Milankovitch cycles]]).\n\n===Solar intensity variation===\n{{Further|Solar variation}}\nSpace-based observations of solar irradiance started in 1978. These measurements show that the solar constant is not constant. It varies on many time scales, including the 11-year sunspot solar cycle.<ref name=\"acrim\"/> When going further back in time, one has to rely on irradiance reconstructions, using sunspots for the past 400&nbsp;years or cosmogenic radionuclides for going back&nbsp;10,000 years.\nSuch reconstructions have been done.<ref>{{cite journal | title = Modeling the Sun's Magnetic Field and Irradiance since 1713 | last1 = Wang | display-authors = etal   | date = 2005 | url = | journal = The Astrophysical Journal | volume = 625 | issue = 1| pages = 522\u2013538 | doi = 10.1086/429689 | bibcode=2005ApJ...625..522W}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal | title = Total solar irradiance since 1996: is there a long-term variation unrelated to solar surface magnetic phenomena? | last1 = Steinhilber | display-authors = etal   | date = 2009 | url =https://www.dora.lib4ri.ch/eawag/islandora/object/eawag%3A6539/datastream/PDF/view | journal = Geophysical Research Letters | volume = 36 | issue = | page = L19704 | doi = 10.1051/0004-6361/200811446 | bibcode=2010A&A...523A..39S| doi-access = free }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal | title = Evolution of the solar irradiance during the Holocene | last1 = Vieira | display-authors = etal   | date = 2011 | url = | journal = Astronomy & Astrophysics | volume = 531 | issue = | page = A6 | doi = 10.1051/0004-6361/201015843 | bibcode=2011A&A...531A...6V|arxiv = 1103.4958 }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal | title = 9,400 years of cosmic radiation and solar activity from ice cores and tree rings | last1 = Steinhilber | display-authors = etal   | date = 2012 | journal = Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences | volume = 109| issue = 16| pages = 5967\u20135971| doi = 10.1073/pnas.1118965109 |bibcode = 2012PNAS..109.5967S | pmid=22474348 | pmc=3341045| url = http://epic.awi.de/30297/1/PNAS-2012-Steinhilber-1118965109.pdf}}</ref> These studies show that in addition to the solar irradiance variation with the solar cycle (the (Schwabe) cycle), the solar activity varies with longer cycles, such as the proposed 88 year ([[Gleisberg cycle]]), 208 year ([[DeVries cycle]]) and 1,000 year ([[Eddy cycle]]).\n\n==Life on Earth==\nThe existence of nearly all [[Organism|life on Earth]] is fueled by light from the Sun. Most [[autotroph]]s, such as plants, use the energy of sunlight, combined with carbon dioxide and water, to produce simple sugars\u2014a process known as [[photosynthesis]]. These sugars are then used as building-blocks and in other synthetic pathways that allow the organism to grow.\n\n[[Heterotroph]]s, such as animals, use light from the Sun indirectly by consuming the products of autotrophs, either by consuming autotrophs, by consuming their products, or by consuming other heterotrophs. The sugars and other molecular components produced by the autotrophs are then broken down, releasing stored solar energy, and giving the heterotroph the energy required for survival. This process is known as [[cellular respiration]].\n\nIn [[prehistory]], humans began to further extend this process by putting plant and animal materials to other uses. They used animal skins for warmth, for example, or wooden weapons to hunt. These skills allowed humans to harvest more of the sunlight than was possible through glycolysis alone, and human population began to grow.\n\nDuring the [[Neolithic Revolution]], the domestication of plants and animals further increased human access to solar energy. Fields devoted to crops were enriched by inedible plant matter, providing sugars and [[nutrients]] for future harvests. Animals that had previously provided humans with only meat and tools once they were killed were now used for labour throughout their lives, fueled by [[grasses]] inedible to humans.\n\nThe more recent discoveries of [[coal]], [[petroleum]] and [[natural gas]] are modern extensions of this trend. These [[fossil fuel]]s are the remnants of ancient plant and animal matter, formed using energy from sunlight and then trapped within Earth for millions of years. Because the stored energy in these fossil fuels has accumulated over many millions of years, they have allowed modern humans to massively increase the production and consumption of [[primary energy]]. As the amount of fossil fuel is large but finite, this cannot continue indefinitely, and various theories exist as to what will follow this stage of human civilization (e.g., [[alternative fuels]], [[Malthusian catastrophe]], [[new urbanism]], [[peak oil]]).\n\n==Cultural aspects==\n{{Unreferenced section|date=February 2011}}\n[[File:Edouard Manet - Luncheon on the Grass - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|upright=1.35|left|[[Eduard Manet]]: ''[[Le d\u00e9jeuner sur l'herbe]]'' (1862-63)]]\nThe effect of sunlight is relevant to [[painting]], evidenced for instance in works of [[Eduard Manet]] and [[Claude Monet]] on outdoor scenes and landscapes.\n[[File:Winter Sunshine.jpg|thumb|upright=1.35|right|''T\u00e9li ver\u0151f\u00e9ny'' (\"Winter Sunshine\") by [[L\u00e1szl\u00f3 Medny\u00e1nszky]], early 20th century]]\nMany people find direct sunlight to be too [[brightness|bright]] for comfort, especially when reading from white paper upon which the sunlight is directly shining. Indeed, looking directly at the Sun can cause long-term vision damage. To compensate for the brightness of sunlight, many people wear [[sunglasses]]. [[Automobile|Cars]], many [[helmet]]s and [[cap]]s are equipped with [[visor]]s to block the Sun from direct vision when the Sun is at a low angle. Sunshine is often blocked from entering buildings through the use of [[wall]]s, [[window blind]]s, [[awning]]s, [[Window shutter|shutters]], [[curtain]]s, or nearby [[shade tree]]s. Sunshine exposure is needed biologically for the creation of [[Vitamin D]] in the skin, a vital compound needed to make strong bone and muscle in the body.\n\nIn colder countries, many people prefer sunnier days and often avoid the [[Shade (shadow)|shade]]. In hotter countries, the converse is true; during the midday hours, many people prefer to stay inside to remain cool. If they do go outside, they seek shade that may be provided by trees, [[Umbrella|parasols]], and so on.\n\nIn many world religions, such as [[Hinduism]], the Sun is considered to be a god, as it is the source of life and energy on Earth. It also formed the basis for religion in [[Ancient Egypt]].\n\n===Sunbathing===<!-- This section is linked from [[Naturism]] -->\n{{main|Sun tanning}}\n{{Unreferenced section|date=January 2015}}\nSunbathing is a popular [[leisure]] activity in which a person sits or lies in direct sunshine. People often sunbathe in comfortable places where there is ample sunlight. Some common places for sunbathing include [[beach]]es, open air [[swimming pool]]s, [[park]]s, [[garden]]s, and [[sidewalk cafe]]s. Sunbathers typically wear limited amounts of clothing or some simply go [[Nudity|nude]]. For some, an alternative to sunbathing is the use of a [[Tanning bed|sunbed]] that generates [[ultraviolet]] light and can be used indoors regardless of weather conditions. Tanning beds have been banned in a number of states in the world.\n\nFor many people with light skin, one purpose for sunbathing is to darken one's [[Human skin color|skin color]] (get a sun tan), as this is considered in some cultures to be attractive, associated with outdoor activity, [[Vacation|vacations/holidays]], and health. Some people prefer [[Naturism|naked]] sunbathing so that an \"all-over\" or \"even\" tan can be obtained, sometimes as part of a specific lifestyle.\n\nControlled [[heliotherapy]], or sunbathing, has been used as a treatment for [[psoriasis]] and other maladies.\n\nSkin tanning is achieved by an increase in the dark pigment inside skin cells called [[melanocyte]]s, and is an automatic response mechanism of the body to sufficient exposure to ultraviolet radiation from the Sun or from artificial sunlamps. Thus, the tan gradually disappears with time, when one is no longer exposed to these sources.\n\n==Effects on human health==\n{{main|Health effects of sunlight exposure}}\nThe [[ultraviolet radiation]] in sunlight has both positive and negative health effects, as it is both a principal source of [[vitamin D3|vitamin D<sub>3</sub>]] and a [[mutagen]].<ref>{{cite journal | pmid = 12174089 | volume=147 | issue=2 | title=Vitamin D and systemic cancer: is this relevant to malignant melanoma? |date=August 2002 | journal=Br.
