His National Front government at the centre led by [[Vishwanath Pratap Singh|V. P.

As a term, it is an unofficial historical designation that derives its name from the city of [[Weimar]], where its [[Constituent assembly|constitutional assembly]] first took place. The official name of the republic remained that of the [[German Reich]] from the [[German Empire]] because of the German tradition of [[Constituent state|substates]]. Although commonly translated as \"German Empire\", ''Reich'' here better translates as \"realm\" in that the term does not necessarily have monarchical connotations in itself. The ''Reich'' was changed from a [[constitutional monarchy]] into a [[republic]]. In English, the country was usually known simply as Germany and the Weimar Republic name became mainstream only in the 1930s.\n\nGermany became a ''de facto'' republic on 9 November 1918 when [[Kaiser]] [[Wilhelm II]] abdicated the German and Prussian thrones with no agreement made on a succession by his son [[Wilhelm, German Crown Prince|Crown Prince Wilhelm]], and became a ''de jure'' republic in February 1919 when the position of President of Germany was created. A [[Weimar National Assembly|national assembly]] was convened in Weimar, where a new [[Weimar constitution|constitution]] for Germany was written and adopted on 11 August 1919. In its fourteen years, the Weimar Republic faced numerous problems, including [[Hyperinflation in the Weimar Republic|hyperinflation]], political extremism (with contending [[Weimar paramilitary groups|paramilitaries]]) as well as contentious relationships with [[Allies of World War I|the victors]] of the [[World War I|First World War]]. Resentment in Germany towards the [[Treaty of Versailles]] was strong especially on the political right where there was great anger towards those who had signed and submitted to the treaty.  The Weimar Republic fulfilled most of the requirements of the Treaty of Versailles although it never completely met its disarmament requirements and eventually paid only a small portion of the war reparations (by twice restructuring its debt through the [[Dawes Plan]] and the [[Young Plan]]).<ref>Marks, Sally (1976). ''The Illusion of Peace: International Relations in Europe, 1918\u20131933'', St. Martin's, NY, pp. 96\u2013105.</ref> Under the [[Locarno Treaties]], Germany accepted the western borders of the country by abandoning [[Irredentism|irredentist]] claims on France and Belgium, but continued to dispute the eastern borders and sought to persuade [[First Austrian Republic|Austria]] to join Germany as one of Germany's states.\n\nFrom 1930 onwards, President [[Paul von Hindenburg]] used [[Article 48 (Weimar Constitution)|emergency powers]] to back Chancellors [[Heinrich Br\u00fcning]], [[Franz von Papen]] and General [[Kurt von Schleicher]]. The [[Great Depression]], exacerbated by Br\u00fcning's policy of deflation, led to a surge in unemployment.<ref name=\"Ursula Buettner 424\">B\u00fcttner, Ursula ''Weimar: die \u00fcberforderte Republik'', Klett-Cotta, 2008, {{ISBN|978-3-608-94308-5}}, p. 424</ref> In 1933, Hindenburg appointed [[Adolf Hitler]] as Chancellor with the [[Nazi Party]] being part of a coalition government. The Nazis held two out of the remaining ten cabinet seats. Von Papen as Vice Chancellor was intended to be the \"''[[\u00e9minence grise]]''\" who would keep Hitler under control, using his close personal connection to Hindenburg. Within months, the [[Reichstag Fire Decree]] and the [[Enabling Act of 1933]] had brought about a state of emergency as it wiped out constitutional governance and civil liberties. Hitler's seizure of power (''[[Machtergreifung]]'') was permissive of government by decree without legislative participation. These events brought the republic to an end\u2014as democracy collapsed, the founding of a single-party state began the [[dictatorship]] of the [[Nazi Germany|Nazi era]].\n\n==Name==\nThe Weimar Republic is so called because [[Weimar National Assembly|the assembly]] that adopted its constitution met at Weimar from 6 February 1919 to 11 August 1919,<ref>{{cite encyclopedia |url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/639027/Weimar-Republic |title=Weimar Republic |encyclopedia=Encyclopedia Britannica|accessdate=2012-06-29}}</ref> but this name only became mainstream after 1933.

A few weeks later, the term {{lang|de|Weimarer Republik}} was first used again by Hitler in a newspaper article.<ref name=EvMaSchnurr/> Only during the 1930s did the term become mainstream, both within and outside Germany.\n\nAccording to historian [[Richard J. Evans]]:\n<blockquote>The continued use of the term 'German Empire', ''Deutsches Reich'', by the Weimar Republic ... conjured up an image among educated Germans that resonated far beyond the institutional structures Bismarck created: the successor to the Roman Empire; the vision of God's Empire here on earth;  the universality of its claim to suzerainty; and a more prosaic but no less powerful sense, the concept of a German state that would include all German speakers in central Europe\u2014'one People, one Reich, one Leader', as the Nazi slogan was to put it.<ref>{{cite book|author=Richard J.

The Weimar Republic retained the {{lang|de|[[Reichsadler]]}}, but without the symbols of the former Monarchy (Crown, Collar, Breast shield with the Prussian Arms). This left the black eagle with one head, facing to the right, with open wings but closed feathers, with a red beak, tongue and claws and white highlighting.\n{{Quote|text=By reason of a decision of the Reich's Government I hereby announce, that the Imperial coat of arms on a gold-yellow shield shows the one headed black eagle, the head turned to the right, the wings open but with closed feathering, beak, tongue and claws in red color.

Only the tiny German [[Principality of Waldeck-Pyrmont]] upheld the tradition and continued to use the [[National colours of Germany|German colours]] called {{lang|de|[[Schwarz-Rot-Gold]]}} in German, ({{lang-en|[[Sable (heraldry)|Black]]-[[Gules|Red]]-[[Or (heraldry)|Gold]]}}) that had originated within a German-held state [[Principality of Reuss-Greiz|as early as 1778]].\n\nThese signs had remained symbols of the Paulskirche movement. Weimar wanted to express its origins in that political movement between 1849 and 1858; while anti-republicans opposed this flag. While the first German Confederal Navy ({{lang|de|[[Reichsflotte]]}}, 1848\u20131852) had proudly deployed a naval [[ensign]] based on {{lang|de|Schwarz-Rot-Gold}}, the Weimar republic navy, or {{lang|de|[[Reichsmarine]]}} (1918\u20131933) insisted on using the pre-1918 colours of the former {{lang|de|[[Kaiserliche Marine]]}} (1871\u20131918), which were Black-White-Red, as did the German merchant marine.\n\nThe republicans took up the idea of the [[Coat of arms of Germany|German Coat of Arms]] established by the Paulskirche movement, using the same [[Heraldic animal|charge animal]], an eagle, in the same colours (black, red and gold), but modernising its form, including a reduction of the heads from two to one. [[Friedrich Ebert]] initially declared the official German coat of arms to be a design by [[Emil Doepler]] (shown in the first infobox above) as of 12 November 1919, following a decision of the German government.<ref name=\"Jana Leichsenring 2008 p. 2\"/>\n\nIn 1928, however, the {{lang|de|Reichswappen}} (Reich coat of arms) designed by Tobias Schwab (1887\u20131967) in 1926 (or 1924<ref>According to sources of the German national football team Schwab created the emblem for the team in 1924.</ref>) replaced it as the official emblem for the German Olympic team.<ref>Cf.

The ''Freikorps'' units were formally disbanded in 1920 (although continued to exist in underground groups), and on 1 January 1921, a new ''[[Reichswehr]]'' (figuratively; ''Defence of the realm'') was created.\n\nThe Treaty of Versailles limited the size of the ''Reichswehr'' to 100,000 soldiers (consisting of seven infantry divisions and three cavalry divisions), 10 armoured cars and a navy (the ''[[Reichsmarine]]'') restricted to 36 ships in active service. No aircraft of any kind was allowed. The main advantage of this limitation, however, was that the ''Reichswehr'' could afford to pick the best recruits for service. However, with inefficient armour and no air support, the ''Reichswehr'' would have had limited combat abilities.\nPrivates were mainly recruited from the countryside, as it was believed that young men from cities were prone to socialist behaviour, which would fray the loyalty of the privates to their conservative officers.\n\nAlthough technically in service of the republic, the army was predominantly officered by conservative reactionaries who were sympathetic to right-wing organisations.  [[Hans von Seeckt]], the head of the ''[[Reichswehr]]'', declared that the army was not loyal to the democratic republic, and would only defend it if it were in their interests.  During the [[Kapp Putsch]] for example, the army refused to fire upon the rebels.  The vulgar and turbulent [[Sturmabteilung|SA]] was the ''Reichswehr's'' main opponent throughout its existence, openly seeking to absorb the army, and the army fired at them during the [[Beerhall Putsch]]. With the ascendance of the [[Schutzstaffel|SS]], the ''Reichswehr'' took a softer line about the Nazis, as the SS presented itself as elitist, respectable, orderly, and busy reforming and dominating the police rather than the army.\n\nIn 1935, two years after Hitler came to power, the ''Reichswehr'' was renamed the ''[[Wehrmacht]]''.\n\n==History==\n\n===November Revolution (1918\u20131919)===\n{{main|German Revolution of 1918\u20131919}}\n\n[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 146-1976-067-10A, Matrosen-Aufstand.jpg|thumb|Sailors during the mutiny in Kiel, November 1918]]\n\nIn October 1918, the constitution of the German Empire was reformed to give more powers to the elected parliament. On 29 October, [[Kiel mutiny|rebellion]] broke out in [[Kiel]] among sailors. There, sailors, soldiers, and workers began electing [[Workers' and Soldiers' Council]]s (''Arbeiter und Soldatenr\u00e4te'') modeled after the [[Soviet (council)|Soviets]] of the [[Russian Revolution of 1917]]. The revolution spread throughout Germany, and participants seized military and civil powers in individual cities. The power takeover was achieved everywhere without loss of life.\n\nAt the time, the Socialist movement which represented mostly laborers was split among two major left-wing parties: the [[Independent Social Democratic Party of Germany]] (USPD), which called for immediate peace [[negotiations]] and favored a soviet-style command economy, and the [[Social Democratic Party of Germany]] (SPD) also known as \"Majority\" Social Democratic Party of Germany (MSPD), which supported the war effort and favoured a [[parliamentary system]]. The rebellion caused great fear in the establishment and in the middle classes because of the [[Russian SFSR|Soviet]]-style aspirations of the councils. To centrist and conservative citizens, the country looked to be on the verge of a communist revolution.\n\nBy 7 November, the revolution had reached [[Munich]], resulting in King [[Ludwig III of Bavaria]] fleeing. The MSPD decided to make use of their support at the grassroots and put themselves at the front of the movement, demanding that Kaiser [[Wilhelm II, German Emperor|Wilhelm II]] abdicate. When he refused, [[Prince Max of Baden]] simply announced that he had done so and frantically attempted to establish a [[Regent|regency]] under another member of the [[House of Hohenzollern]]. [[Gustav Noske]], a self-appointed military expert in the MSPD, was sent to Kiel to prevent any further unrest and took on the task of controlling the mutinous sailors and their supporters in the Kiel barracks. The sailors and soldiers, inexperienced in matters of revolutionary combat, welcomed him as an experienced politician and allowed him to negotiate a settlement, thus defusing the initial anger of the revolutionaries in uniform.\n\nOn 9 November 1918, the \"German Republic\" was proclaimed by MSPD member [[Philipp Scheidemann]] at the [[Reichstag (building)|''Reichstag'' building]] in Berlin, to the fury of [[Friedrich Ebert]], the leader of the MSPD, who thought that the question of monarchy or republic should be answered by a national assembly. Two hours later, a \"Free Socialist Republic\" was proclaimed, {{convert |2|km|mi|abbr=on}} away, at the ''[[Berliner Stadtschloss]]''. The proclamation was issued by [[Karl Liebknecht]], co-leader (with [[Rosa Luxemburg]]) of the communist [[Spartakusbund]] (Spartacist League), a group of a few hundred supporters of the Russian revolution that had allied itself with the USPD in 1917. In a legally questionable act, Imperial Chancellor (''Reichskanzler'') Prince Max of Baden transferred his powers to Friedrich Ebert, who, shattered by the monarchy's fall, reluctantly accepted. In view of the mass support for more radical reforms among the workers' councils, a [[coalition]] government called \"[[Council of the People's Deputies]]\" (''Rat der Volksbeauftragten'') was established, consisting of three MSPD and three USPD members. Led by Ebert for the MSPD and [[Hugo Haase]] for the USPD it sought to act as a provisional cabinet of ministers. But the power question was unanswered. Although the new government was confirmed by the Berlin worker and soldier council, it was opposed by the [[Spartacist League]].\n\n[[File:Bundesarchiv B 145 Bild-P011502, Berlin, Reichskanzlei, Philipp Scheidemann.jpg|thumb|upright|left|[[Philipp Scheidemann]] addresses a crowd from a window of the [[Reich Chancellery]], 9 November 1918]]\n\nOn 11 November 1918, [[Armistice with Germany (Compi\u00e8gne)|an armistice was signed at Compi\u00e8gne]] by German representatives. It effectively ended military operations between the Allies and Germany. It amounted to German capitulation, without any concessions by the Allies; the naval blockade would continue until complete peace terms were agreed.\n\nFrom November 1918 to January 1919, Germany was governed by the \"Council of the People's Deputies\", under the leadership of Ebert and Haase. The Council issued a large number of decrees that radically shifted German policies. It introduced the [[eight-hour day|eight-hour workday]], domestic labour reform, works councils, agricultural labour reform, right of civil-service associations, local municipality social welfare relief (split between ''Reich'' and States) and important national health insurance, re-instatement of demobilised workers, protection from arbitrary dismissal with appeal as a right, regulated wage agreement, and universal suffrage from 20 years of age in all types of elections\u2014local and national. Ebert called for a \"National Congress of Councils\" (''Reichsr\u00e4tekongress''), which took place from 16 to 20 December 1918, and in which the MSPD had the majority. Thus, Ebert was able to institute elections for a provisional National Assembly that would be given the task of writing a democratic constitution for parliamentary government, marginalizing the movement that called for a socialist republic.\n\nTo ensure his fledgling government maintained control over the country, Ebert made an agreement with the OHL, now led by Ludendorff's successor General [[Wilhelm Groener]]. The '[[Ebert\u2013Groener pact]]' stipulated that the government would not attempt to reform the army so long as the army swore to protect the state. On the one hand, this agreement symbolised the acceptance of the new government by the military, assuaging concern among the middle classes; on the other hand, it was thought contrary to working-class interests by left wing social democrats and communists, and was also opposed by the far right who believed democracy would make Germany weaker. The new ''Reichswehr'' armed forces, limited by the [[Treaty of Versailles]] to 100,000 army soldiers and 15,000 sailors, remained fully under the control of the German [[Officer (armed forces)|officer]] class, despite their nominal re-organisation.\n\nThe Executive Council of the Workers\u2019 and Soldiers\u2019 Councils, a coalition that included Majority Socialists, Independent Socialists, workers, and soldiers, implemented a programme of progressive social change, introducing reforms such as the eight-hour workday, the releasing of political prisoners, the abolition of press censorship, increases in workers\u2019 old-age, sick and unemployment benefits, and the bestowing upon labour the unrestricted right to organise into unions.<ref>Hitler by John Toland</ref>\n\nA number of other reforms were carried out in Germany during the revolutionary period. It was made harder for estates to sack workers and prevent them from leaving when they wanted to; under the Provisional Act for Agricultural Labour of 23 November 1918 the normal period of notice for management, and for most resident labourers, was set at six weeks.

The ensuing street fighting left several dead and injured on both sides. The USPD leaders were outraged by what they believed was treachery by the MSPD, which, in their view, had joined with the anti-communist military to suppress the revolution. Thus, the USPD left the \"Council of the People's Deputies\" after only seven weeks. On 30 December, the split deepened when the [[Communist Party of Germany]] (KPD) was formed out of a number of radical left-wing groups, including the left wing of the USPD and the \"[[Spartacist League]]\" group.\n\nIn January, the Spartacist League and others in the streets of Berlin made more armed attempts to establish communism, known as the [[Spartacist uprising]]. Those attempts were put down by paramilitary ''[[Freikorps]]'' units consisting of volunteer soldiers. Bloody street fights culminated in the beating and shooting deaths of [[Rosa Luxemburg]] and [[Karl Liebknecht]] after their arrests on 15 January.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=Vlzg_5WteHoC&printsec=frontcover&dq=William+Pelz#v=onepage&q=William%20Pelz&f=false|title=Against Capitalism: The European Left on the March|publisher=[[Peter Lang (publisher)|Peter Lang]], New York|author=William A.

In this time, the radical left-wing parties, including the USPD and KPD, were barely able to get themselves organised, leading to a solid majority of seats for the MSPD moderate forces. To avoid the ongoing fights in Berlin, the National Assembly convened in the city of [[Weimar, Germany|Weimar]], giving the future Republic its unofficial name. The [[Weimar Constitution]] created a republic under a [[parliamentary republic|parliamentary republic system]] with the ''Reichstag'' elected by [[proportional representation]]. The democratic parties obtained a solid 80% of the vote.\n\nDuring the debates in Weimar, fighting continued. A [[Bavarian Soviet Republic|Soviet republic]] was declared in [[Munich]], but was quickly put down by ''Freikorps'' and remnants of the regular army. The fall of the [[Munich Soviet Republic]] to these units, many of which were situated on the extreme right, resulted in the growth of far-right movements and organisations in [[Bavaria]], including [[Organisation Consul]], the [[Nazi Party]], and societies of exiled Russian Monarchists. Sporadic fighting continued to flare up around the country. In eastern provinces, forces loyal to Germany's fallen Monarchy fought the republic, while militias of Polish nationalists fought for independence: [[Greater Poland Uprising (1918\u20131919)|Great Poland Uprising]] in [[Provinz Posen]] and three [[Silesian uprisings]] in [[Upper Silesia]].\n\nGermany lost the war because the country ran out of allies and its economic resources were running out; support among the population began to crumble in 1916 and by mid-1918 there was support for the war only among the die-hard monarchists and conservatives. The decisive blow came with the entry of the United States into the conflict, which made its vast industrial resources available to the beleaguered Allies. By late summer 1918 the German reserves were exhausted while fresh American troops arrived in France at the rate of 10,000 a day. Retreat and defeat were at hand, and the Army told the Kaiser to abdicate for it could no longer support him. Although in retreat, the German armies were still on French and Belgian territory when the war ended on 11 November. Ludendorf and Hindenburg soon proclaimed that it was the defeatism of the civilian population that had made defeat inevitable. The die-hard nationalists then blamed the civilians for betraying the army and the surrender. This was the \"[[stab-in-the-back myth]]\" that was unceasingly propagated by the right in the 1920s and ensured that many monarchists and conservatives would refuse to support the government of what they called the \"November criminals\".<ref>{{cite journal |first=Wilhelm |last=Diest |first2=E.

The severe food shortages improved little to none up until 1923.  Many German civilians expected life to return to prewar normalcy following the removal of the naval blockade in June 1919. Instead, the struggles induced by the First World War persisted for the decade following.  Throughout the war German officials made rash decisions to combat the growing hunger of the nation, most of which were highly unsuccessful. Examples include the nationwide pig slaughter, [[Schweinemord]], in 1915.  The rationale behind exterminating the population of swine was to decrease the use of potatoes and turnips for animal consumption, transitioning all foods toward human consumption. \n\nIn 1922, now three years after the German signing of the Treaty of Versailles, meat consumption in the country had not increased since the war era. 22&nbsp;kg per person per year was still less than half of the 52&nbsp;kg statistic in 1913, before the onset of the war.  German citizens felt the food shortages even deeper than during the war, because the reality of the nation contrasted so starkly with their expectations.  The burdens of World War I lightened little in the immediate years following, and with the onset of the Treaty of Versailles, coupled by mass inflation, Germany still remained in a crisis.  The continuity of pain showed the Weimar authority in a negative light, and public opinion was one of the main sources behind its failure.<ref>Heinzelmann, Ursula. Beyond Bratwurst: A History of Food in Germany.

Military-industrial activity had almost ceased, although controlled demobilisation kept unemployment at around one million. In part, the economic losses can also be attributed to the Allied blockade of Germany until the Treaty of Versailles.\n\nThe Allies permitted only low import levels of goods that most Germans could not afford.{{Citation needed|date=October 2011}} After four years of war and famine, many German workers were exhausted, physically impaired and discouraged. Millions were disenchanted with what they considered capitalism and hoping for a new era. Meanwhile, the currency depreciated, and would continue to depreciate following the French invasion of the Ruhr.{{Citation needed|date=October 2011}}\n\nThe treaty was signed June 28, 1919 and is easily divided into four categories: territorial issues, disarmament demands, reparations, and assignment of guilt. The German colonial empire was stripped and given over to Allied forces. The greater blow to Germans however was that they were forced to give up the territory of Alsace-Lorraine. Many German borderlands were demilitarized and allowed to self-determine. The German military was forced to have no more than 100,000 men with only 4,000 officers. Germany was forced to destroy all its fortifications in the West and was prohibited from having an air force, tanks, poison gas, and heavy artillery. Many ships were scuttled and submarines and dreadnoughts were prohibited. Germany was forced under Article 235 to pay 20 billion gold marks, about 4.5 billion dollars by 1921. Article 231 placed Germany and her allies with responsibility for causing all the loss and damage suffered by the Allies. While Article 235 angered many Germans, no part of the treaty was more fought over than Article 231.<ref>Vincent, C.  Paul (1997).

Explaining the rise of extreme nationalist movements in Germany shortly after the war, British historian [[Ian Kershaw]] points to the \"national disgrace\" that was \"felt throughout Germany at the humiliating terms imposed by the victorious Allies and reflected in the Versailles Treaty...with its confiscation of territory on the eastern border and even more so its 'guilt clause'.\"<ref>{{cite book|author=Ian Kershaw|title=Hitler, 1889\u20131936: Hubris|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=nV-N10gyoFwC&pg=PA136|year=2000|publisher=W.W. Norton|page=136|isbn=9780393320350}}</ref> [[Adolf Hitler]] repeatedly blamed the republic and its democracy for accepting the oppressive terms of this treaty. The Republic's first ''[[President of Germany (1919\u20131945)|Reichspr\u00e4sident]]'' (\"Reich President\"), [[Friedrich Ebert]] of the SPD, signed the new German constitution into law on 11 August 1919.\n\nThe new post-World War I Germany, stripped of all colonies, became 13% smaller in its European territory than its imperial predecessor. Of these losses, a large proportion consisted of provinces that were originally Polish, and Alsace-Lorraine, seized by Germany in 1870, where Germans constituted only part or a minority of local populations despite nationalist outrage at the fragmentation of Germany.\n\n=====Allied Rhineland occupation=====\n{{main|Allied occupation of the Rhineland}}\n\nThe occupation of the [[Rhineland]] took place following the [[Armistice with Germany]] of 11 November 1918. The occupying armies consisted of [[National Army (USA)|American]], [[Belgian Army|Belgian]], [[British Army|British]] and [[French Army|French]] forces.\n\nIn 1920, under massive French pressure, the [[Saar (League of Nations)|Saar]] was separated from the Rhine Province and administered by the [[League of Nations]] until a plebiscite in 1935, when the region was returned to the ''Deutsches Reich''. At the same time, in 1920, the districts of [[Eupen]] and [[Malmedy]] were transferred to [[Belgium]] (see [[German-Speaking Community of Belgium]]). Shortly after, France completely occupied the Rhineland, strictly controlling all important industrial areas.\n\n=====Reparations=====\nThe actual amount of reparations that Germany was obliged to pay out was not the 132&nbsp;billion marks decided in the London Schedule of 1921 but rather the 50&nbsp;billion marks stipulated in the A and B Bonds. Historian Sally Marks says the 112&nbsp;billion marks in \"C bonds\" were entirely chimerical\u2014a device to fool the public into thinking Germany would pay much more. The actual total payout from 1920 to 1931 (when payments were suspended indefinitely) was 20&nbsp;billion [[German gold mark]]s, worth about US$5&nbsp;billion or \u00a31&nbsp;billion British pounds. 12.5&nbsp;billion was cash that came mostly from loans from New York bankers. The rest was goods such as coal and chemicals, or from assets like railway equipment. The reparations bill was fixed in 1921 on the basis of a German capacity to pay, not on the basis of Allied claims. The highly publicised rhetoric of 1919 about paying for all the damages and all the veterans' benefits was irrelevant for the total, but it did determine how the recipients spent their share. Germany owed reparations chiefly to France, Britain, Italy and Belgium; the US Treasury received $100&nbsp;million.<ref>{{Cite journal |jstor = 4545835|title = The Myths of Reparations|journal = Central European History|volume = 11|issue = 3|pages = 231\u2013255|last1 = Marks|first1 = Sally|year = 1978|doi = 10.1017/S0008938900018707}}</ref>\n\n=====Hyperinflation=====\n{{further|Hyperinflation in the Weimar Republic}}\nIn the early post-war years, inflation was growing at an alarming rate, but the government simply printed more currency to pay debts. By 1923, the Republic claimed it could no longer afford the [[World War I reparations|reparations]] payments required by the Versailles Treaty, and the government defaulted on some payments. In response, French and Belgian troops [[Occupation of the Ruhr|occupied the Ruhr region]], Germany's most productive industrial region at the time, taking control of most mining and manufacturing companies in January 1923. Strikes were called, and passive resistance was encouraged. These strikes lasted eight months, further damaging both the economy and society.{{Citation needed|date = March 2016}}\n\nThe strike prevented some goods from being produced, but one industrialist, [[Hugo Stinnes]], was able to create a vast empire out of bankrupt companies. Because the production costs in Germany were falling almost hourly, the prices for German products were unbeatable. Stinnes made sure that he was paid in dollars, which meant that by mid-1923, his industrial empire was worth more than the entire German economy. By the end of the year, over two hundred factories were working full-time to produce paper for the spiralling bank note production. Stinnes' empire collapsed when the government-sponsored inflation was stopped in November 1923.{{Citation needed|date = March 2016}}\n\nIn 1919, one loaf of bread cost 1 mark; by 1923, the same loaf of bread cost 100&nbsp;billion marks.{{Citation needed|date = March 2016}}\n\n[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 102-00193, Inflation, Ein-Millionen-Markschein.jpg|thumb|upright=1.15|One-million mark notes used as notepaper, October 1923]]\nSince striking workers were paid benefits by the state, much additional currency was printed, fuelling a period of [[hyperinflation]]. The [[1920s German inflation]] started when Germany had no goods to trade. The government printed money to deal with the crisis; this meant payments within Germany were made with worthless paper money, and helped formerly great industrialists to pay back their own loans. This also led to pay raises for workers and for businessmen who wanted to profit from it. Circulation of money rocketed, and soon banknotes were being overprinted to a thousand times their nominal value and every town produced its own promissory notes; many banks and industrial firms did the same.{{Citation needed|date = March 2016}}\n\nThe value of the ''[[German papiermark|Papiermark]]'' had declined from 4.2 Marks per U.S. dollar in 1914 to one million per dollar by August 1923. This led to further criticism of the Republic. On 15 November 1923, a new currency, the ''[[German rentenmark|Rentenmark]]'', was introduced at the rate of one [[1000000000000 (number)|trillion]] (1,000,000,000,000) ''Papiermark'' for one ''Rentenmark'', an action known as [[redenomination]]. At that time, one U.S. dollar was equal to 4.2 ''Rentenmark''. Reparation payments were resumed, and the Ruhr was returned to Germany under the [[Locarno Treaties]], which defined the borders between Germany, France, and Belgium.\n\n====Political turmoil====\n{{Unreferenced section|date=October 2011}}\n[[File:50 millionen mark 1 september 1923.jpg|thumb|right|A 50 million mark banknote issued in 1923, worth approximately one U.S. dollar when issued, would have been worth approximately 12&nbsp;million U.S. dollars nine years earlier, but within a few weeks inflation made the banknote practically worthless.]]\n\nThe Republic was soon under attack from both [[Left-wing politics|left-]] and [[right-wing politics|right-wing]] sources. The radical left accused the ruling Social Democrats of having betrayed the ideals of the workers' movement by preventing a communist revolution and sought to overthrow the Republic and do so themselves. Various right-wing sources opposed any democratic system, preferring an authoritarian, autocratic state like the 1871 Empire. To further undermine the Republic's credibility, some right-wingers (especially certain members of the former [[officer corps]]) also blamed an [[Stab-in-the-back myth|alleged conspiracy]] of Socialists and Jews for Germany's defeat in World War I.\n\nIn the next five years, the central government, assured of the support of the Reichswehr, dealt severely with the occasional outbreaks of violence in Germany's large cities. The left claimed that the Social Democrats had betrayed the ideals of the revolution, while the army and the government-financed ''Freikorps'' committed hundreds of acts of gratuitous violence against striking workers.\n\nThe first challenge to the Weimar Republic came when a group of communists and anarchists took over the [[Bavaria]]n government in [[Munich]] and declared the creation of the [[Bavarian Soviet Republic]]. The uprising was brutally attacked by ''[[Freikorps]]'', which consisted mainly of ex-soldiers dismissed from the army and who were well-paid to put down forces of the Far Left. The ''Freikorps'' was an army outside the control of the government, but they were in close contact with their allies in the Reichswehr.\n\nOn 13 March 1920 during the [[Kapp Putsch]], 12,000 ''Freikorps'' soldiers occupied Berlin and installed [[Wolfgang Kapp]], a right-wing journalist, as chancellor. The national government fled to [[Stuttgart]] and called for a [[general strike]] against the putsch. The strike meant that no \"official\" pronouncements could be published, and with the civil service out on strike, the Kapp government collapsed after only four days on 17 March.\n\nInspired by the general strikes, a workers' [[Ruhr Uprising|uprising]] began in the [[Ruhr area|Ruhr region]] when 50,000 people formed a \"Red Army\" and took control of the province. The regular army and the ''Freikorps'' ended the uprising on their own authority. The rebels were campaigning for an extension of the plans to nationalise major industries and supported the national government, but the SPD leaders did not want to lend support to the growing USPD, who favoured the establishment of a socialist regime. The repression of an uprising of SPD supporters by the reactionary forces in the ''Freikorps'' on the instructions of the SPD ministers was to become a major source of conflict within the socialist movement and thus contributed to the weakening of the only group that could have withstood the National Socialist movement. Other rebellions were put down in March 1921 in [[Saxony]] and [[Hamburg]].\n\n[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 146-1972-062-01, Berlin, bettelnder Kriegsinvalide.jpg|thumb|A disabled war veteran in Berlin, 1923]]\nIn 1922, Germany signed the [[Treaty of Rapallo, 1922|Treaty of Rapallo]] with the Soviet Union, which allowed Germany to train military personnel in exchange for giving Russia military technology. This was against the [[Treaty of Versailles]], which limited Germany to 100,000 soldiers and no conscription, naval forces of 15,000 men, twelve destroyers, six battleships, and six cruisers, no [[submarine]]s or aircraft. However, Russia had pulled out of World War I against the Germans as a result of the 1917 Russian Revolution, and was excluded from the [[League of Nations]]. Thus, Germany seized the chance to make an ally. [[Walther Rathenau]], the Jewish [[Foreign Minister of Germany|Foreign Minister]] who signed the treaty, was assassinated two months later by two ultra-nationalist army officers.\n\nFurther pressure from the political right came in 1923 with the [[Beer Hall Putsch]], also called the Munich Putsch, staged by the [[Nazi Party]] under [[Adolf Hitler]] in Munich. In 1920, the [[German Workers' Party]] had become the [[National Socialist German Workers' Party]] (NSDAP), or [[Nazi party]], and would become a driving force in the collapse of Weimar. Hitler named himself as chairman of the party in July 1921. On 8 November 1923, the ''[[Kampfbund]]'', in a pact with [[Erich Ludendorff]], took over a meeting by Bavarian prime minister [[Gustav Ritter von Kahr|Gustav von Kahr]] at a beer hall in Munich.\n\nLudendorff and Hitler declared that the Weimar government was deposed and that they were planning to take control of Munich the following day. The 3,000 rebels were thwarted by the Bavarian authorities. Hitler was arrested and sentenced to five years in prison for high [[treason]], a minimum sentence for the charge. Hitler served less than eight months in a comfortable cell, receiving a daily stream of visitors before his release on 20 December 1924. While in jail, Hitler dictated ''[[Mein Kampf]]'', which laid out his ideas and future policies. Hitler now decided to focus on legal methods of gaining power.\n\n===Golden Era (1924\u20131929)===\n[[Gustav Stresemann]] was ''[[Chancellor of Germany|Reichskanzler]]'' for 100 days in 1923, and served as [[Minister for Foreign Affairs (Germany)|foreign minister]] from 1923 to 1929, a period of relative stability for the Weimar Republic, known in Germany as ''Goldene Zwanziger'' (\"[[Golden Twenties]]\"). Prominent features of this period were a growing economy and a consequent decrease in civil unrest.\n\nOnce civil stability had been restored, Stresemann began stabilising the German currency, which promoted confidence in the German economy and helped the recovery that was so ardently needed for the German nation to keep up with their reparation repayments, while at the same time feeding and supplying the nation.\n\nOnce the economic situation had stabilised, Stresemann could begin putting a permanent currency in place, called the ''[[Rentenmark]]'' (October 1923), which again contributed to the growing level of international confidence in the Weimar Republic's economy.\n\n[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 102-00231, Radioansprache von Kanzler Wilhelm Marx.jpg|thumb|[[Wilhelm Marx]]'s Christmas broadcast, December 1923]]\nTo help Germany meet reparation obligations, the [[Dawes Plan]] was created in 1924. This was an agreement between American banks and the German government in which the American banks lent money to German banks with German assets as collateral to help it pay reparations. The German railways, the National Bank and many industries were therefore mortgaged as securities for the stable currency and the loans.<ref name=Kitchen-241>Kitchen, ''Illustrated History of Germany'', Cambridge University Press, 1996, p. 241</ref>\n\nGermany was the first state to establish diplomatic relations with the new [[Soviet Union]]. Under the [[Treaty of Rapallo, 1922|Treaty of Rapallo]], Germany accorded it formal (''de jure'') recognition, and the two mutually cancelled all pre-war debts and renounced war claims.  In October 1925 the [[Treaty of Locarno]] was signed by Germany, France, Belgium, Britain and Italy; it recognised Germany's borders with France and Belgium. Moreover, Britain, Italy and Belgium undertook to assist France in the case that German troops marched into the demilitarised Rhineland. Locarno paved the way for Germany's admission to the [[League of Nations]] in 1926.<ref>Wolfgang Elz, \"Foreign policy\" in Anthony McElligott, ed.,  ''Weimar Germany'' (2009) pp. 50\u201377</ref> Germany signed arbitration conventions with France and Belgium and arbitration treaties with Poland and [[Czechoslovakia]], undertaking to refer any future disputes to an arbitration tribunal or to the [[Permanent Court of International Justice]].  Other foreign achievements were the evacuation of foreign troops from the Ruhr in 1925. In 1926, Germany was admitted to the League of Nations as a permanent member, improving her international standing and giving the right to vote on League matters.\n\nOverall trade increased and unemployment fell. Stresemann's reforms did not relieve the underlying weaknesses of Weimar but gave the appearance of a stable democracy. Even Stresemann's 'German People's party' failed to gain nationwide recognition, and instead featured in the 'flip-flop' coalitions. The Grand Coalition headed by Muller inspired some faith in the government, but that didn't last. Governments frequently lasted only a year, comparable to the political situation in France during the 1930s. The major weakness in constitutional terms was the inherent instability of the coalitions, which often fell prior to elections. The growing dependence on American finance was to prove fleeting, and Germany was one of the worst hit nations in the [[Great Depression]].\n\n===Culture===\n[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 183-K0623-0502-001, Berlin, Tanztee im \"Esplanade\".jpg|thumb|left|upright=1.15|The \"[[Golden Twenties]]\" in Berlin: a jazz band plays for a tea dance at the hotel Esplanade, 1926]]\nThe 1920s saw a remarkable cultural renaissance in Germany. During the worst phase of hyperinflation in 1923, the clubs and bars were full of speculators who spent their daily profits so they would not lose the value the following day. Berlin intellectuals responded by condemning the excesses of what they considered capitalism, and demanding revolutionary changes on the cultural scenery.\n\nInfluenced by the brief cultural explosion in the Soviet Union, German literature, cinema, theatre and musical works entered a phase of great creativity. Innovative street theatre brought plays to the public, and the [[cabaret]] scene and jazz band became very popular. According to the clich\u00e9, modern young women were [[Americanization|Americanized]], wearing makeup, short hair, smoking and breaking with traditional [[mores]]. The euphoria surrounding [[Josephine Baker]] in the metropolis of Berlin for instance, where she was declared an \"erotic [[goddess]]\" and in many ways admired and respected, kindled further \"ultramodern\" sensations in the minds of the German public.<ref>{{cite web |title=Josephine Baker in Berlin |url=http://www.cabaret-berlin.com/?p=440 |work=Cabaret Berlin \u2013 Exploring the entertainment of the Weimar era |date=8 December 2010 |accessdate=11 June 2011}}</ref> Art and a new type of architecture taught at \"[[Bauhaus]]\" schools reflected the new ideas of the time, with artists such as [[George Grosz]] being fined for defaming the military and for [[blasphemy]].\n\nArtists in Berlin were influenced by other contemporary progressive cultural movements, such as the Impressionist and Expressionist painters in Paris, as well as the Cubists. Likewise, American progressive architects were admired. Many of the new buildings built during this era followed a straight-lined, geometrical style.

Conservatives and reactionaries feared that Germany was betraying its traditional values by adopting popular styles from abroad, particularly those Hollywood was popularizing in American films, while New York became the global capital of fashion.

When American banks withdrew their loans to German companies, the onset of severe unemployment could not be stopped by conventional economic measures. Unemployment grew rapidly, at 4 million in 1930,<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://spartacus-educational.com/GERunemployment.htm|title=Unemployment in Nazi Germany|work=Spartacus Educational|access-date=2017-03-01|language=en}}</ref> and in September 1930 a political earthquake shook the republic to its foundations. The [[Nazi Party]] (NSDAP) entered the Reichstag with 19% of the popular vote and made the fragile coalition system by which every chancellor had governed unworkable. The last years of the Weimar Republic were stamped by even more political instability than in the previous years. The administrations of Chancellors [[Heinrich Br\u00fcning|Br\u00fcning]], [[Franz von Papen|Papen]], [[Kurt von Schleicher|Schleicher]] and, from 30 January to 23 March 1933, [[Adolf Hitler|Hitler]] governed through [[Decree|presidential decree]] rather than through [[Reichstag (Weimar Republic)|parliamentary]] consultation.\n\n====Br\u00fcning's policy of deflation (1930\u20131932)====\nOn 29 March 1930, after months of lobbying by General [[Kurt von Schleicher]] on behalf of the military, the finance expert [[Heinrich Br\u00fcning]] was appointed as M\u00fcller's successor by ''[[President of Germany (1919\u20131945)|Reichspr\u00e4sident]]'' [[Paul von Hindenburg]]. The new government was expected to lead a political shift towards [[conservatism]].\n\nAs Br\u00fcning had no majority support in the ''Reichstag'', he became, through the use of [[Article 48 (Weimar Constitution)|the emergency powers granted to the ''Reichspr\u00e4sident'' (Article 48)]] by [[Weimar Constitution|the constitution]], the first Weimar chancellor to operate independently of parliament. This made him dependent on the ''Reichspr\u00e4sident'', Hindenburg.<ref name=\"ThomasAdam\">Thomas Adam, ''Germany and the Americas: Culture, Politics, and History'', 2005, {{ISBN|1-85109-633-7}}, p. 185</ref> After a bill to reform the Reich's finances was opposed by the ''Reichstag'', it was made an emergency [[decree]] by Hindenburg. On 18 July, as a result of opposition from the SPD, [[Communist Party of Germany|KPD]], [[German National People's Party|DNVP]] and the small contingent of [[Nazi Party|NSDAP]] members, the ''Reichstag'' again rejected the bill by a slim margin. Immediately afterward, Br\u00fcning submitted the president's decree that the ''Reichstag'' be dissolved. The consequent [[German federal election, 1930|general election on 14 September]] resulted in an enormous political shift within the ''Reichstag'': 18.3% of the vote went to the NSDAP, five times the percentage won in 1928. As a result, it was no longer possible to form a pro-republican majority, not even with a [[grand coalition]] that excluded the KPD, DNVP and NSDAP. This encouraged an escalation in the number of public demonstrations and instances of paramilitary violence organised by the NSDAP.\n[[File:Bundesarchiv B 145 Bild-P049500, Berlin, Aufmarsch der SA in Spandau.jpg|thumb|The [[Sturmabteilung|SA]] had nearly two million members at the end of 1932.]]\nBetween 1930 and 1932, Br\u00fcning tried to reform the Weimar Republic without a parliamentary majority, governing, when necessary, through the President's emergency decrees. In line with the contemporary economic theory (subsequently termed \"[[Causes of the Great Depression#Leave-it-alone liquidationism (1929\u201333)|leave-it-alone liquidationism]]\"), he enacted a draconian policy of [[deflation]] and [[Austerity|drastically cutting state expenditure]].<ref name=\"ThomasAdam\" /> Among other measures, he completely halted all public grants to the obligatory unemployment insurance introduced in 1927, resulting in workers making higher contributions and fewer benefits for the unemployed.

His long-term view was that deflation would, in any case, be the best way to help the economy. His primary goal was to remove Germany's reparation payments by convincing the Allies that they could no longer be paid.<ref>Hans Ulrich Wehler, Deutsche Gesellschaftsgeschichte, Band 4, 1.

As more of the working and middle classes turned against Br\u00fcning, however, more of the capitalists and landowners declared themselves in favour of his opponents Hitler and [[Alfred Hugenberg|Hugenberg]]. By late 1931, the conservative movement was dead and Hindenburg and the ''[[Reichswehr]]'' had begun to contemplate dropping Br\u00fcning in favour of accommodating Hugenberg and Hitler. Although Hindenburg disliked Hugenberg and despised Hitler, he was no less a supporter of the sort of anti-democratic counter-revolution that the DNVP and NSDAP represented.<ref name=\"Rosenberg\">{{cite book |last=Rosenberg |first=Arthur |authorlink=Arthur Rosenberg |title=A History of The German Republic |publisher=Methuen |year=1936 |location=London}}</ref> In April 1932, Br\u00fcning had actively supported Hindenburg's successful campaign against Hitler for re-election as ''Reichspr\u00e4sident'';<ref>Unlike the ''Reichskanzler'', the ''Reichspr\u00e4sident'' was elected by a direct popular vote.</ref> five weeks later, on 20 May 1932, he had lost Hindenburg's support and duly resigned as ''Reichskanzler''.\n\n====Papen deal====\nHindenburg then appointed [[Franz von Papen]] as new ''Reichskanzler''. Papen lifted the ban on the NSDAP's [[Sturmabteilung|SA]] paramilitary, imposed after the street riots, in an unsuccessful attempt to secure the backing of Hitler.{{citation needed|date=May 2016}}\n\nPapen was closely associated with the industrialist and land-owning classes and pursued an extremely conservative policy along Hindenburg's lines. He appointed as ''Reichswehr'' Minister [[Kurt von Schleicher]], and all the members of the new cabinet were of the same political opinion as Hindenburg. The government was expected to assure itself of the co-operation of Hitler. Since the republicans were not yet ready to take action, the Communists did not want to support the republic and the conservatives had shot their political bolt, Hitler and Hugenberg were certain to achieve power.{{citation needed|reason=Who claims that it was certain?|date=May 2016}}\n\n====Elections of July 1932====\nBecause most parties opposed the new government, Papen had the ''[[Reichstag (Weimar Republic)|Reichstag]]'' dissolved and called for new elections. [[German federal election, July 1932|The general elections on 31 July 1932]] yielded major gains for the [[Communist Party of Germany|Communists]], and for the Nazis, who won 37.3% of the vote\u2014their [[Nazi Party#Federal election results|high-water mark in a free election]]. The Nazi party then supplanted the [[Social Democratic Party of Germany|Social Democrats]] as the largest party in the ''Reichstag'', although it did not gain a majority.\n\nThe immediate question was what part the now large Nazi Party would play in the Government of the country. The party owed its huge increase to growing support from middle-class people, whose traditional parties were swallowed up by the Nazi Party. The millions of radical adherents at first forced the Party towards the Left. They wanted a renewed Germany and a new organisation of German society. The left of the Nazi party strove desperately against any drift into the train of such capitalist and feudal reactionaries. Therefore, Hitler refused ministry under Papen, and demanded the chancellorship for himself, but was rejected by Hindenburg on 13 August 1932. There was still no majority in the ''Reichstag'' for any government; as a result, the ''Reichstag'' was dissolved and elections took place once more in the hope that a stable majority would result. {{Citation needed|date=December 2017}}\n\n====Schleicher cabinet====\n[[German federal election, November 1932|The 6 November 1932 elections]] yielded 33% for the Nazis,<ref name=\"Evans\">{{cite book |last=Evans |first=Richard J. |authorlink=Richard J.

Franz von Papen stepped down and was succeeded as Chancellor (''Reichskanzler'') by General [[Kurt von Schleicher]] on 3 December. Schleicher, a retired army officer, had developed in an atmosphere of semi-obscurity and intrigue that encompassed the Republican military policy. He had for years been in the camp of those supporting the Conservative counter-revolution. Schleicher's bold and unsuccessful plan was to build a majority in the ''Reichstag'' by uniting the [[trade unionist]] left wings of the various parties, including that of the Nazis led by [[Gregor Strasser]]. This policy did not prove successful either.\n\n[[File:Plakat Hugenberg Papen Seldte 1933.jpg|thumb|upright=0.9|Poster for the nationalist \"Black\u2013White\u2013Red\" coalition of [[Alfred Hugenberg]] ([[German National People's Party|DNVP]] leader), [[Franz von Papen]], and [[Franz Seldte]]]]\n\nIn this brief Presidential Dictatorship intermission, Schleicher assumed the role of \"Socialist General\" and entered into relations with the Christian Trade Unions, the relativley left of the Nazi party, and even with the Social Democrats. Schleicher planned for a sort of labour government under his Generalship. But the ''Reichswehr'' officers were not prepared for this, the working class had a natural distrust of their future allies, and the great capitalists and landowners also did not like the plans.\n\nHitler learned from Papen that the general had not received from Hindenburg the authority to abolish the ''Reichstag'' parliament, whereas any majority of seats did. The cabinet (under a previous interpretation of Article 48) ruled without a sitting ''Reichstag'', which could vote only for its own dissolution. Hitler also learned that all past crippling Nazi debts were to be relieved by German big business.\n\nOn 22 January, Hitler's efforts to persuade [[Oskar von Hindenburg]], the President's son and confidant, included threats to bring criminal charges over estate taxation irregularities at the President's Neudeck estate; although {{convert|5000|acre|km2|abbr=on}} extra were soon allotted to Hindenburg's property. Outmaneuvered by Papen and Hitler on plans for the new cabinet, and having lost Hindenburg's confidence, Schleicher asked for new elections. On 28 January, Papen described Hitler to [[Paul von Hindenburg]] as only a minority part of an alternative, Papen-arranged government. The four great political movements, the SPD, Communists, [[Centre Party (Germany)|Centre]], and the Nazis were in opposition.\n\nOn 29 January, Hitler and Papen thwarted a last-minute threat of an officially sanctioned ''Reichswehr'' takeover, and on 30 January 1933 Hindenburg accepted the new Papen-Nationalist-Hitler coalition, with the Nazis holding only three of eleven Cabinet seats: Hitler as Chancellor, [[Wilhelm Frick]] as Minister of the Interior and [[Hermann G\u00f6ring]] as Minister Without Portfolio. Later that day, the first cabinet meeting was attended by only two political parties, representing a minority in the ''Reichstag'': The Nazis and the [[German National People's Party]] (DNVP), led by [[Alfred Hugenberg]], with 196 and 52 seats respectively. Eyeing the Catholic [[Centre Party (Germany)|Centre Party]]'s 70 (plus 20 [[Bavarian People's Party|BVP]]) seats, Hitler refused their leader's demands for constitutional \"concessions\" (amounting to protection) and planned for dissolution of the ''Reichstag''.\n\nHindenburg, despite his misgivings about the Nazis' goals and about Hitler as a personality, reluctantly agreed to Papen's theory that, with Nazi popular support on the wane, Hitler could now be controlled as Chancellor. This date, dubbed by the Nazis as the ''[[Machtergreifung]]'' (seizure of power), is commonly seen as the beginning of [[Nazi Germany]].\n\n===End of the Weimar Republic===\n\n====Hitler's chancellorship (1933)====\nHitler was sworn in as [[Chancellor]] on the morning of 30 January 1933 in what some observers later described as a brief and indifferent ceremony. By early February, a mere week after Hitler's assumption of the chancellorship, the government had begun to clamp down on the opposition. Meetings of the left-wing parties were banned and even some of the moderate parties found their members threatened and assaulted. Measures with an appearance of legality suppressed the Communist Party in mid-February and included the plainly illegal arrests of ''Reichstag'' deputies.\n\nThe [[Reichstag fire]] on 27 February was blamed by Hitler's government on the Communists. Hitler used the ensuing state of emergency to obtain the presidential assent of Hindenburg to issue the [[Reichstag Fire Decree]] the following day. The decree invoked [[Article 48 (Weimar Constitution)|Article 48]] of the [[Weimar Constitution]] and \"indefinitely suspended\" a number of constitutional protections of civil liberties, allowing the Nazi government to take swift action against political meetings, arresting and killing the Communists.\n\nHitler and the Nazis exploited the German state's broadcasting and aviation facilities in a massive attempt to sway the electorate, but this election yielded a scant majority of 16 seats for the coalition. At the [[German federal election, March 1933|''Reichstag'' elections]], which took place on 5 March 1933, the NSDAP obtained 17&nbsp;million votes. The Communist, Social Democrat and Catholic Centre votes stood firm. This was the last multi-party election of the Weimar Republic and the last multi-party all-German election for 57 years.\n\nHitler addressed disparate interest groups, stressing the necessity for a definitive solution to the perpetual instability of the Weimar Republic. He now blamed Germany's problems on the Communists, even threatening their lives on 3 March. Former Chancellor [[Heinrich Br\u00fcning]] proclaimed that his Centre Party would resist any constitutional change and appealed to the President for an investigation of the ''Reichstag'' fire. Hitler's successful plan was to induce what remained of the now Communist-depleted Reichstag to grant him, and the Government, the authority to issue decrees with the force of law. The hitherto Presidential Dictatorship hereby was to give itself a new legal form.\n\nOn 15 March, the first [[cabinet meeting]] was attended by the two coalition parties, representing a minority in the ''Reichstag'': The Nazis and the [[German National People's Party|DNVP]] led by [[Alfred Hugenberg]] (288 + 52 seats). According to the [[Nuremberg Trials]], this cabinet meeting's first order of business was how at last to achieve the complete counter-revolution by means of the constitutionally allowed [[Enabling Act of 1933|Enabling Act]], requiring a 66% parliamentary majority. This Act would, and did, lead Hitler and the [[NSDAP]] toward his goal of unfettered dictatorial powers.<ref>As Kershaw notes (p. 468 {{Full citation needed|date=July 2014}}), after the passage of the Act, \"Hitler was still far from wielding absolute power. But vital steps toward consolidating his dictatorship now followed in quick succession.\"</ref>\n\n====Hitler cabinet meeting in mid-March====\nAt the cabinet meeting on 15 March, Hitler introduced the [[Enabling Act of 1933|Enabling Act]], which would have authorised the cabinet to enact legislation without the approval of the ''Reichstag''. Meanwhile, the only remaining question for the Nazis was whether the Catholic Centre Party (''Zentrum'') would support the Enabling Act in the ''Reichstag'', thereby providing the \u2154 majority required to ratify a law that amended the constitution. Hitler expressed his confidence to win over the Centre's votes. Hitler is recorded at the Nuremberg Trials as being sure of eventual Centre Party Germany capitulation and thus rejecting of the DNVP's suggestions to \"balance\" the majority through further arrests, this time of Social Democrats. Hitler, however, assured his coalition partners that arrests would resume after the elections and, in fact, some 26 SPD Social Democrats were physically removed. After meeting with Centre leader Monsignor [[Ludwig Kaas]] and other Centre Trade Union leaders daily and denying them a substantial participation in the government, negotiation succeeded in respect of guarantees towards Catholic civil-servants and education issues.\n\nAt the last internal Centre meeting prior to the debate on the Enabling Act, Kaas expressed no preference or suggestion on the vote, but as a way of mollifying opposition by Centre members to the granting of further powers to Hitler, Kaas somehow arranged for a letter of constitutional guarantee from Hitler himself prior to his voting with the centre ''en bloc'' in favour of the [[Enabling Act of 1933|Enabling Act]]. This guarantee was not ultimately given. Kaas, the party's chairman since 1928, had strong connections to the [[Vatican City|Vatican]] Secretary of State, later [[Pope Pius XII]]. In return for pledging his support for the act, Kaas would use his connections with the Vatican to set in train and draft the [[Holy See]]'s long desired ''[[Reichskonkordat]]'' with Germany (only possible with the co-operation of the Nazis).\n\nLudwig Kaas is considered along with Papen as being one of the two most important political figures in the creation of a [[National Socialist German Workers Party|National Socialist]] dictatorship.<ref name=\"vKlemperer\">{{cite book|last=Klemperer|first=Klemens von|title=German Resistance Against Hitler:The Search for Allies Abroad 1938\u20131945|publisher= OUP / Clarendon Press|year=1992|location=Oxford|isbn=0-19-821940-7}}</ref>\n\n====Enabling Act negotiations====\nOn 20 March, negotiation began between Hitler and Frick on one side and the Catholic Centre Party (''Zentrum'') leaders\u2014Kaas, Stegerwald and Hackelsburger on the other. The aim was to settle on conditions under which Centre would vote in favour of the [[Enabling Act]]. Because of the Nazis' narrow majority in the ''Reichstag'', Centre's support was necessary to receive the required two-thirds majority vote. On 22 March, the negotiations concluded; Hitler promised to continue the existence of the German states, agreed not to use the new grant of power to change the constitution, and promised to retain ''Zentrum'' members in the civil service. Hitler also pledged to protect the Catholic confessional schools and to respect the concordats signed between the [[Holy See]] and [[Bavaria]] (1924), [[Prussia]] (1929) and [[Baden]] (1931). Hitler also agreed to mention these promises in his speech to the ''Reichstag'' before the vote on the Enabling Act.\n\nThe ceremonial opening of the ''Reichstag'' on 21 March was held at the [[Garrison Church (Potsdam)|Garrison Church]] in [[Potsdam]], a shrine of [[Prussia]]nism, in the presence of many [[Junker]] landowners and representatives of the imperial military caste. This impressive and often emotional spectacle\u2014orchestrated by [[Joseph Goebbels]]\u2014aimed to link Hitler's government with Germany's imperial past and portray National Socialism as a guarantor of the nation's future. The ceremony helped convince the \"old guard\" Prussian military elite of Hitler's homage to their long tradition and, in turn, produced the relatively convincing view that Hitler's government had the support of Germany's traditional protector\u2014the Army. Such support would publicly signal a return to conservatism to curb the problems affecting the Weimar Republic, and that stability might be at hand. In a cynical and politically adroit move, Hitler bowed in apparently respectful humility before President and Field Marshal [[Paul von Hindenburg|Hindenburg]].\n\n====Passage of the Enabling Act====\nThe ''Reichstag'' convened on 23 March 1933, and in the midday opening, Hitler made a historic speech, appearing outwardly calm and conciliatory. Hitler presented an appealing prospect of respect towards Christianity by paying tribute to the Christian faiths as \"essential elements for safeguarding the soul of the German people\". He promised to respect their rights and declared that his government's \"ambition is a peaceful accord between [[Separation of church and state|Church and State]]\" and that he hoped \"to improve [their] friendly relations with the [[Holy See]]\". This speech aimed especially at the future recognition by the named [[Holy See]] and therefore to the votes of the Centre Party addressing many concerns Kaas had voiced during the previous talks. Kaas is considered to have had a hand therefore in the drafting of the speech.<ref name=\"vKlemperer\"/> Kaas is also reported as voicing the Holy See's desire for Hitler as bulwark against [[atheist]]ic Russian [[nihilism]] previously as early as May 1932.<ref>{{cite book|last=Mowrer|first=Edgar Ansel|authorlink=Edgar Ansel Mowrer| title=Triumph and Turmoil|url=https://archive.org/details/triumphturmoilpe0000mowr|url-access=registration|year=1970|publisher=Allen & Unwin|location=London|page=[https://archive.org/details/triumphturmoilpe0000mowr/page/209 209]|isbn= 0-04-920026-7}}</ref>\n\nHitler promised that the Act did not threaten the existence of either the ''[[Reichstag (Weimar Republic)|Reichstag]]'' or the ''[[Reichsrat (Germany)|Reichsrat]]'', that the authority of the President remained untouched and that the ''[[States of Germany|L\u00e4nder]]'' would not be abolished. During an adjournment, the other parties (notably the Centre) met to discuss their intentions.<ref>Kershaw pp. 467\u201368.</ref>\n\nIn the debate prior to the vote on the Enabling Act, Hitler orchestrated the full political menace of his paramilitary forces like the [[Sturmabteilung|storm division]] in the streets to intimidate reluctant ''Reichstag'' deputies into approving the Enabling Act. The Communists' 81 seats had been empty since the ''Reichstag'' Fire Decree and other lesser known procedural measures, thus excluding their anticipated \"No\" votes from the balloting. [[Otto Wels]], the leader of the Social Democrats, whose seats were similarly depleted from 120 to below 100, was the only speaker to defend democracy and in a futile but brave effort to deny Hitler the \u2154 majority, he made a speech critical of the abandonment of democracy to dictatorship. At this, Hitler could no longer restrain his wrath.<ref>{{cite book |title=The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich |authorlink=William L. Shirer |last=Shirer |first=William L. |publisher=[[Simon & Schuster]] |location= New York |year=1960 |isbn=0-671-72868-7|title-link=The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich }}</ref>\n\nIn his retort to Wels, Hitler abandoned earlier pretence at calm statesmanship and delivered a characteristic screaming diatribe, promising to exterminate all Communists in Germany and threatening Wels' Social Democrats as well. He did not even want their support for the bill. \"Germany will become free, but not through you,\" he shouted.<ref>Kershaw p. 468.</ref> Meanwhile, Hitler's promised written guarantee to Monsignor Kaas was being typed up, it was asserted to Kaas, and thereby Kaas was persuaded to silently deliver the Centre bloc's votes for the Enabling Act anyway. The Act\u2014formally titled the \"Act for the Removal of Distress from People and Reich\"\u2014was passed by a vote of 441 to 94. Only the SPD had voted against the Act. Every other member of the ''Reichstag'', whether from the largest or the smallest party, voted in favour of the Act. It went into effect the following day, 24 March.\n\n====Consequences====\n{{main|Nazi Germany}}\nThe passage of the [[Enabling Act of 1933]] is widely considered to mark the end of the Weimar Republic and the beginning of the Nazi era. It empowered the cabinet to legislate without the approval of the Reichstag or the President, and to enact laws that were contrary to the constitution. Before the March 1933 elections, Hitler had persuaded Hindenburg to promulgate the [[Reichstag Fire Decree]] using [[Article 48]], which empowered the government to restrict \"the rights of habeas corpus [...] freedom of the press, the freedom to organise and assemble, the privacy of postal, telegraphic and telephonic communications\" and legalised search warrants and confiscation \"beyond legal limits otherwise prescribed\". This was intended to forestall any action against the government by the Communists. Hitler used the provisions of the Enabling Act to pre-empt possible opposition to his dictatorship from other sources, in which he was mostly successful.\n\nThe Nazis in power brought almost all major organisations into line under Nazi control or direction, which was termed  ''[[Gleichschaltung]]''.\n\nThe constitution of 1919 was never formally repealed, but the Enabling Act meant that it was a dead letter.  Those articles of the Weimar constitution (which dealt with the state's relationship to various Christian churches) remain part of the German Basic Law.\n\n==Reasons for failure==\nThe reasons for the Weimar Republic's collapse are the subject of continuing debate. It may have been doomed from the beginning since even moderates disliked it and extremists on both the left and right loathed it, a situation often referred to as a \"democracy without democrats\".<ref>{{cite book |last=Primoratz |first=Igor |date=2008-05-08 |title=Patriotism: Philosophical and Political Perspectives |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Ob8oDAAAQBAJ&pg=PA98&lpg=PA98#v=onepage&q&f=false |publisher=Routledge |page=98 |isbn=978-0754671220 }}</ref> Germany had limited democratic traditions, and Weimar democracy was widely seen as chaotic. Since Weimar politicians had been blamed for the ''Dolchsto\u00df'' (\"[[Stab-in-the-back myth|stab-in-the-back]]\"), a widely believed theory that Germany's surrender in World War I had been the unnecessary act of traitors, the popular legitimacy of the government was on shaky ground. As normal parliamentary lawmaking broke down and was replaced around 1930 by a series of [[Article 48 (Weimar Constitution)|emergency decrees]], the decreasing popular legitimacy of the government further drove voters to extremist parties.\n\nNo single reason can explain the failure of the Weimar Republic. The most commonly asserted causes can be grouped into three categories: economic problems, institutional problems, and the roles of specific individuals.\n\n===Economic problems===\n<!--This section is linked from [[W.E.B. Du Bois]]-->\n{{main|Dawes Plan|Reichsbank}}\nThe Weimar Republic had some of the most serious economic problems ever experienced by any Western democracy in history. Rampant [[hyperinflation]], massive unemployment, and a large drop in living standards were primary factors. From 1923 to 1929, there was a short period of economic recovery, but the [[Great Depression]] of the 1930s led to a worldwide recession. Germany was particularly affected because it depended heavily on American loans. In 1926, about 2 million Germans were unemployed, which rose to around 6&nbsp;million in 1932. Many blamed the Weimar Republic. That was made apparent when political parties on both right and left wanting to disband the Republic altogether made any democratic majority in Parliament impossible.\n\nThe Weimar Republic was severely affected by the [[Great Depression]]. The economic stagnation led to increased demands on Germany to repay the debts owed to the United States. As the Weimar Republic was very fragile in all its existence, the depression was devastating, and played a major role in the [[Nazi Party|Nazi]] takeover.\n\nMost Germans thought the [[Treaty of Versailles]] was a punishing and degrading document because it forced them to surrender resource-rich areas and pay massive amounts of compensation. The punitive reparations caused consternation and resentment, but the actual economic damage resulting from the Treaty of Versailles is difficult to determine. While the official reparations were considerable, Germany ended up paying only a fraction of them. However, the reparations damaged Germany's economy by discouraging market loans, which forced the Weimar government to finance its deficit by printing more currency, causing rampant hyperinflation. At the beginning of 1920, 50 Marks was equivalent to one US Dollar. By the end of 1923, one US Dollar was equal to 4,200,000,000,000 Marks.<ref>https://www.pmgnotes.com/news/article/7334/German-Vampire-Note/</ref> In addition, the rapid disintegration of Germany in 1919 by the return of a disillusioned army, the rapid change from possible victory in 1918 to defeat in 1919, and the political chaos may have lead to extreme nationalism. {{citation needed|date=April 2018}}\n\n[[Princeton University|Princeton]] historian [[Harold James (historian)|Harold James]] argues that there was a clear link between economic decline and people turning to extremist politics.<ref>James, Harold, \"Economic Reasons for the Collapse of the Weimar Republic\", in ''Weimar: Why Did German Democracy Fail'', ed. Ian Kershaw, Widenfeld and Nicolson, (London: 1990), pp. 30\u201357.</ref>\n\n===Institutional problems===\nIt is widely believed that the [[Weimar Constitution|1919 constitution]] had several weaknesses, making the eventual establishment of a dictatorship likely, but it is unknown whether a different constitution could have prevented the rise of the Nazi party. However, the 1949 West German constitution (the [[Basic Law of the Federal Republic of Germany]]) is generally viewed as a strong response to these flaws.\n* The institution of the ''Reichspr\u00e4sident'' was frequently considered as an ''Ersatzkaiser'' (\"substitute emperor\"), an attempt to replace the emperors with a similarly strong institution meant to diminish party politics. [[Article 48 (Weimar Constitution)|Article 48]] of the Constitution gave the President power to \"take all necessary steps\" if \"public order and security are seriously disturbed or endangered\". Although it was intended as an emergency clause, it was often used before 1933 to issue decrees without the support of Parliament (see above) and also made ''[[Gleichschaltung]]'' easier.\n* During the Weimar Republic, it was accepted that a law did not have to conform to the constitution as long as it had the support of two-thirds of parliament, the same majority needed to change the constitution (''verfassungsdurchbrechende Gesetze''). That was a precedent for the [[Enabling Act of 1933]]. The Basic Law of 1949 requires an explicit change of the wording, and it prohibits abolishing the basic rights or the federal structure of the republic.\n* The use of a [[proportional representation]] without large [[election threshold|thresholds]] meant a party with a small amount of support could gain entry into the ''[[Reichstag (Weimar Republic)|Reichstag]]''. That led to many small parties, some extremist, building political bases within the system. To counter the problem, the modern German Bundestag introduced a 5% [[election threshold|threshold limit]] for a party to gain parliamentary representation. However, the Reichstag of the monarchy was fractioned to a similar degree even if it was elected by [[majoritarian system|majority vote]] (under a [[two-round system]]). The republic fell not by the small parties but by the strength of the communists, conservatives and ultimately the national socialists.\n* The ''Reichstag'' could remove the ''Reichskanzler'' from office even if it was unable to agree on a successor. The use of such a [[motion of no confidence]] meant that since 1932, a government could not be held in office when the parliament came together. As a result, the 1949 ''Grundgesetz'' (\"Basic Law\") stipulates that a chancellor may not be removed by Parliament unless a successor is elected at the same time, known as a \"[[constructive vote of no confidence]]\".\n* The political parties started to have a role in creating a government only in October 1918. They were massively inexperienced.\n\n===Role of individuals===\nBr\u00fcning's economic policy from 1930 to 1932 has been the subject of much debate. It caused many Germans to identify the Republic with cuts in social spending and extremely liberal economics. Whether there were alternatives to this policy during the [[Great Depression]] is an open question.\n\n[[Paul von Hindenburg]] became ''Reichspr\u00e4sident'' in 1925. As he was an old style monarchist conservative, he had little love lost for the Republic,{{citation needed|date=November 2018}} but for the most part, he formally acted within the bounds of the constitution;{{citation needed|date=November 2018}} however, he ultimately\u2014on the advice of his son and others close to him\u2014appointed Hitler chancellor, thereby effectively ending the Republic. Additionally, Hindenburg's death in 1934 ended the last obstacle for Hitler to assume full power in the Weimar Republic.\n\n==Constituent states==\n{{Main|States of the Weimar Republic}}\n\nPrior to World War I, the [[States of the German Empire|constituent states of the German Empire]] were 22 smaller monarchies, three republican city-states and the Imperial territory of [[Alsace-Lorraine]]. After the territorial losses of the [[Treaty of Versailles]] and the German Revolution of 1918\u20131919, the remaining states continued as republics. The former [[Ernestine duchies]] continued briefly as republics before merging to form the state of [[Thuringia]] in 1920, except for [[Saxe-Coburg]], which became part of [[Bavaria]].\n\n{{Weimar Republic States|width=550|include_list=y}}\nThese states were gradually ''de facto'' abolished under the Nazi regime via the [[Gleichschaltung]] process, whereby they were effectively replaced by [[Gau (country subdivision)|Gaue]]. However, the city-state of [[Free City of L\u00fcbeck|L\u00fcbeck]] was formally incorporated into Prussia in 1937 following the [[Greater Hamburg Act]], apparently motivated by Hitler's personal dislike for the city. Most of the remaining states were formally dissolved by the Allies at the end of World War II and ultimately reorganised into the modern [[states of Germany]].{{citation needed|date=November 2018}}\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|Germany|1920s}}\n* [[W\u00fcrttemberg Landtag elections in the Weimar Republic]]\n* [[Timeline of the Weimar Republic]]\n* [[The 1920s Berlin Project]]\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist|30em}}\n\n==Further reading==\n{{refbegin|30em}}\n* {{cite book|authorlink=William Sheridan Allen|last=Allen|first=William Sheridan|title=The Nazi seizure of Power: the experience of a single German town, 1922\u20131945|url=https://archive.org/details/naziseizureofpow0000alle_m2p7|url-access=registration|location=New York, Toronto| publisher=F.

As a term, it is an unofficial historical designation that derives its name from the city of [[Weimar]], where its [[Constituent assembly|constitutional assembly]] first took place. The official name of the republic remained that of the [[German Reich]] from the [[German Empire]] because of the German tradition of [[Constituent state|substates]]. Although commonly translated as \"German Empire\", ''Reich'' here better translates as \"realm\" in that the term does not necessarily have monarchical connotations in itself. The ''Reich'' was changed from a [[constitutional monarchy]] into a [[republic]]. In English, the country was usually known simply as Germany and the Weimar Republic name became mainstream only in the 1930s.\n\nGermany became a ''de facto'' republic on 9 November 1918 when [[Kaiser]] [[Wilhelm II]] abdicated the German and Prussian thrones with no agreement made on a succession by his son [[Wilhelm, German Crown Prince|Crown Prince Wilhelm]], and became a ''de jure'' republic in February 1919 when the position of President of Germany was created. A [[Weimar National Assembly|national assembly]] was convened in Weimar, where a new [[Weimar constitution|constitution]] for Germany was written and adopted on 11 August 1919. In its fourteen years, the Weimar Republic faced numerous problems, including [[Hyperinflation in the Weimar Republic|hyperinflation]], political extremism (with contending [[Weimar paramilitary groups|paramilitaries]]) as well as contentious relationships with [[Allies of World War I|the victors]] of the [[World War I|First World War]]. Resentment in Germany towards the [[Treaty of Versailles]] was strong especially on the political right where there was great anger towards those who had signed and submitted to the treaty.  The Weimar Republic fulfilled most of the requirements of the Treaty of Versailles although it never completely met its disarmament requirements and eventually paid only a small portion of the war reparations (by twice restructuring its debt through the [[Dawes Plan]] and the [[Young Plan]]).<ref>Marks, Sally (1976). ''The Illusion of Peace: International Relations in Europe, 1918\u20131933'', St. Martin's, NY, pp. 96\u2013105.</ref> Under the [[Locarno Treaties]], Germany accepted the western borders of the country by abandoning [[Irredentism|irredentist]] claims on France and Belgium, but continued to dispute the eastern borders and sought to persuade [[First Austrian Republic|Austria]] to join Germany as one of Germany's states.\n\nFrom 1930 onwards, President [[Paul von Hindenburg]] used [[Article 48 (Weimar Constitution)|emergency powers]] to back Chancellors [[Heinrich Br\u00fcning]], [[Franz von Papen]] and General [[Kurt von Schleicher]]. The [[Great Depression]], exacerbated by Br\u00fcning's policy of deflation, led to a surge in unemployment.<ref name=\"Ursula Buettner 424\">B\u00fcttner, Ursula ''Weimar: die \u00fcberforderte Republik'', Klett-Cotta, 2008, {{ISBN|978-3-608-94308-5}}, p. 424</ref> In 1933, Hindenburg appointed [[Adolf Hitler]] as Chancellor with the [[Nazi Party]] being part of a coalition government. The Nazis held two out of the remaining ten cabinet seats. Von Papen as Vice Chancellor was intended to be the \"''[[\u00e9minence grise]]''\" who would keep Hitler under control, using his close personal connection to Hindenburg. Within months, the [[Reichstag Fire Decree]] and the [[Enabling Act of 1933]] had brought about a state of emergency as it wiped out constitutional governance and civil liberties. Hitler's seizure of power (''[[Machtergreifung]]'') was permissive of government by decree without legislative participation. These events brought the republic to an end\u2014as democracy collapsed, the founding of a single-party state began the [[dictatorship]] of the [[Nazi Germany|Nazi era]].\n\n==Name==\nThe Weimar Republic is so called because [[Weimar National Assembly|the assembly]] that adopted its constitution met at Weimar from 6 February 1919 to 11 August 1919,<ref>{{cite encyclopedia |url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/639027/Weimar-Republic |title=Weimar Republic |encyclopedia=Encyclopedia Britannica|accessdate=2012-06-29}}</ref> but this name only became mainstream after 1933.

A few weeks later, the term {{lang|de|Weimarer Republik}} was first used again by Hitler in a newspaper article.<ref name=EvMaSchnurr/> Only during the 1930s did the term become mainstream, both within and outside Germany.\n\nAccording to historian [[Richard J. Evans]]:\n<blockquote>The continued use of the term 'German Empire', ''Deutsches Reich'', by the Weimar Republic ... conjured up an image among educated Germans that resonated far beyond the institutional structures Bismarck created: the successor to the Roman Empire; the vision of God's Empire here on earth;  the universality of its claim to suzerainty; and a more prosaic but no less powerful sense, the concept of a German state that would include all German speakers in central Europe\u2014'one People, one Reich, one Leader', as the Nazi slogan was to put it.<ref>{{cite book|author=Richard J.

This left the black eagle with one head, facing to the right, with open wings but closed feathers, with a red beak, tongue and claws and white highlighting.\n{{Quote|text=By reason of a decision of the Reich's Government I hereby announce, that the Imperial coat of arms on a gold-yellow shield shows the one headed black eagle, the head turned to the right, the wings open but with closed feathering, beak, tongue and claws in red color.

Only the tiny German [[Principality of Waldeck-Pyrmont]] upheld the tradition and continued to use the [[National colours of Germany|German colours]] called {{lang|de|[[Schwarz-Rot-Gold]]}} in German, ({{lang-en|[[Sable (heraldry)|Black]]-[[Gules|Red]]-[[Or (heraldry)|Gold]]}}) that had originated within a German-held state [[Principality of Reuss-Greiz|as early as 1778]].\n\nThese signs had remained symbols of the Paulskirche movement. Weimar wanted to express its origins in that political movement between 1849 and 1858; while anti-republicans opposed this flag. While the first German Confederal Navy ({{lang|de|[[Reichsflotte]]}}, 1848\u20131852) had proudly deployed a naval [[ensign]] based on {{lang|de|Schwarz-Rot-Gold}}, the Weimar republic navy, or {{lang|de|[[Reichsmarine]]}} (1918\u20131933) insisted on using the pre-1918 colours of the former {{lang|de|[[Kaiserliche Marine]]}} (1871\u20131918), which were Black-White-Red, as did the German merchant marine.\n\nThe republicans took up the idea of the [[Coat of arms of Germany|German Coat of Arms]] established by the Paulskirche movement, using the same [[Heraldic animal|charge animal]], an eagle, in the same colours (black, red and gold), but modernising its form, including a reduction of the heads from two to one.

The ''Freikorps'' units were formally disbanded in 1920 (although continued to exist in underground groups), and on 1 January 1921, a new ''[[Reichswehr]]'' (figuratively; ''Defence of the realm'') was created.\n\nThe Treaty of Versailles limited the size of the ''Reichswehr'' to 100,000 soldiers (consisting of seven infantry divisions and three cavalry divisions), 10 armoured cars and a navy (the ''[[Reichsmarine]]'') restricted to 36 ships in active service. No aircraft of any kind was allowed. The main advantage of this limitation, however, was that the ''Reichswehr'' could afford to pick the best recruits for service. However, with inefficient armour and no air support, the ''Reichswehr'' would have had limited combat abilities.\nPrivates were mainly recruited from the countryside, as it was believed that young men from cities were prone to socialist behaviour, which would fray the loyalty of the privates to their conservative officers.\n\nAlthough technically in service of the republic, the army was predominantly officered by conservative reactionaries who were sympathetic to right-wing organisations.  [[Hans von Seeckt]], the head of the ''[[Reichswehr]]'', declared that the army was not loyal to the democratic republic, and would only defend it if it were in their interests.  During the [[Kapp Putsch]] for example, the army refused to fire upon the rebels.  The vulgar and turbulent [[Sturmabteilung|SA]] was the ''Reichswehr's'' main opponent throughout its existence, openly seeking to absorb the army, and the army fired at them during the [[Beerhall Putsch]]. With the ascendance of the [[Schutzstaffel|SS]], the ''Reichswehr'' took a softer line about the Nazis, as the SS presented itself as elitist, respectable, orderly, and busy reforming and dominating the police rather than the army.\n\nIn 1935, two years after Hitler came to power, the ''Reichswehr'' was renamed the ''[[Wehrmacht]]''.\n\n==History==\n\n===November Revolution (1918\u20131919)===\n{{main|German Revolution of 1918\u20131919}}\n\n[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 146-1976-067-10A, Matrosen-Aufstand.jpg|thumb|Sailors during the mutiny in Kiel, November 1918]]\n\nIn October 1918, the constitution of the German Empire was reformed to give more powers to the elected parliament. On 29 October, [[Kiel mutiny|rebellion]] broke out in [[Kiel]] among sailors. There, sailors, soldiers, and workers began electing [[Workers' and Soldiers' Council]]s (''Arbeiter und Soldatenr\u00e4te'') modeled after the [[Soviet (council)|Soviets]] of the [[Russian Revolution of 1917]]. The revolution spread throughout Germany, and participants seized military and civil powers in individual cities. The power takeover was achieved everywhere without loss of life.\n\nAt the time, the Socialist movement which represented mostly laborers was split among two major left-wing parties: the [[Independent Social Democratic Party of Germany]] (USPD), which called for immediate peace [[negotiations]] and favored a soviet-style command economy, and the [[Social Democratic Party of Germany]] (SPD) also known as \"Majority\" Social Democratic Party of Germany (MSPD), which supported the war effort and favoured a [[parliamentary system]]. The rebellion caused great fear in the establishment and in the middle classes because of the [[Russian SFSR|Soviet]]-style aspirations of the councils. To centrist and conservative citizens, the country looked to be on the verge of a communist revolution.\n\nBy 7 November, the revolution had reached [[Munich]], resulting in King [[Ludwig III of Bavaria]] fleeing. The MSPD decided to make use of their support at the grassroots and put themselves at the front of the movement, demanding that Kaiser [[Wilhelm II, German Emperor|Wilhelm II]] abdicate. When he refused, [[Prince Max of Baden]] simply announced that he had done so and frantically attempted to establish a [[Regent|regency]] under another member of the [[House of Hohenzollern]]. [[Gustav Noske]], a self-appointed military expert in the MSPD, was sent to Kiel to prevent any further unrest and took on the task of controlling the mutinous sailors and their supporters in the Kiel barracks. The sailors and soldiers, inexperienced in matters of revolutionary combat, welcomed him as an experienced politician and allowed him to negotiate a settlement, thus defusing the initial anger of the revolutionaries in uniform.\n\nOn 9 November 1918, the \"German Republic\" was proclaimed by MSPD member [[Philipp Scheidemann]] at the [[Reichstag (building)|''Reichstag'' building]] in Berlin, to the fury of [[Friedrich Ebert]], the leader of the MSPD, who thought that the question of monarchy or republic should be answered by a national assembly. Two hours later, a \"Free Socialist Republic\" was proclaimed, {{convert |2|km|mi|abbr=on}} away, at the ''[[Berliner Stadtschloss]]''. The proclamation was issued by [[Karl Liebknecht]], co-leader (with [[Rosa Luxemburg]]) of the communist [[Spartakusbund]] (Spartacist League), a group of a few hundred supporters of the Russian revolution that had allied itself with the USPD in 1917. In a legally questionable act, Imperial Chancellor (''Reichskanzler'') Prince Max of Baden transferred his powers to Friedrich Ebert, who, shattered by the monarchy's fall, reluctantly accepted. In view of the mass support for more radical reforms among the workers' councils, a [[coalition]] government called \"[[Council of the People's Deputies]]\" (''Rat der Volksbeauftragten'') was established, consisting of three MSPD and three USPD members. Led by Ebert for the MSPD and [[Hugo Haase]] for the USPD it sought to act as a provisional cabinet of ministers. But the power question was unanswered. Although the new government was confirmed by the Berlin worker and soldier council, it was opposed by the [[Spartacist League]].\n\n[[File:Bundesarchiv B 145 Bild-P011502, Berlin, Reichskanzlei, Philipp Scheidemann.jpg|thumb|upright|left|[[Philipp Scheidemann]] addresses a crowd from a window of the [[Reich Chancellery]], 9 November 1918]]\n\nOn 11 November 1918, [[Armistice with Germany (Compi\u00e8gne)|an armistice was signed at Compi\u00e8gne]] by German representatives. It effectively ended military operations between the Allies and Germany. It amounted to German capitulation, without any concessions by the Allies; the naval blockade would continue until complete peace terms were agreed.\n\nFrom November 1918 to January 1919, Germany was governed by the \"Council of the People's Deputies\", under the leadership of Ebert and Haase. The Council issued a large number of decrees that radically shifted German policies. It introduced the [[eight-hour day|eight-hour workday]], domestic labour reform, works councils, agricultural labour reform, right of civil-service associations, local municipality social welfare relief (split between ''Reich'' and States) and important national health insurance, re-instatement of demobilised workers, protection from arbitrary dismissal with appeal as a right, regulated wage agreement, and universal suffrage from 20 years of age in all types of elections\u2014local and national. Ebert called for a \"National Congress of Councils\" (''Reichsr\u00e4tekongress''), which took place from 16 to 20 December 1918, and in which the MSPD had the majority. Thus, Ebert was able to institute elections for a provisional National Assembly that would be given the task of writing a democratic constitution for parliamentary government, marginalizing the movement that called for a socialist republic.\n\nTo ensure his fledgling government maintained control over the country, Ebert made an agreement with the OHL, now led by Ludendorff's successor General [[Wilhelm Groener]]. The '[[Ebert\u2013Groener pact]]' stipulated that the government would not attempt to reform the army so long as the army swore to protect the state. On the one hand, this agreement symbolised the acceptance of the new government by the military, assuaging concern among the middle classes; on the other hand, it was thought contrary to working-class interests by left wing social democrats and communists, and was also opposed by the far right who believed democracy would make Germany weaker. The new ''Reichswehr'' armed forces, limited by the [[Treaty of Versailles]] to 100,000 army soldiers and 15,000 sailors, remained fully under the control of the German [[Officer (armed forces)|officer]] class, despite their nominal re-organisation.\n\nThe Executive Council of the Workers\u2019 and Soldiers\u2019 Councils, a coalition that included Majority Socialists, Independent Socialists, workers, and soldiers, implemented a programme of progressive social change, introducing reforms such as the eight-hour workday, the releasing of political prisoners, the abolition of press censorship, increases in workers\u2019 old-age, sick and unemployment benefits, and the bestowing upon labour the unrestricted right to organise into unions.<ref>Hitler by John Toland</ref>\n\nA number of other reforms were carried out in Germany during the revolutionary period. It was made harder for estates to sack workers and prevent them from leaving when they wanted to; under the Provisional Act for Agricultural Labour of 23 November 1918 the normal period of notice for management, and for most resident labourers, was set at six weeks. In addition, a supplementary directive of December 1918 specified that female (and child) workers were entitled to a fifteen-minute break if they worked between four and six hours, thirty minutes for workdays lasting six to eight hours, and one hour for longer days.<ref>ir.uiowa.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1091&context=law_pubs</ref> A decree on 23 December 1918 established committees (composed of workers' representatives \"in their relation to the employer\") to safeguard the rights of workers. The right to bargain collectively was also established, while it was made obligatory \"to elect workers\u2019 committees on estates and establish conciliation committees\". A decree on 3 February 1919 removed the right of employers to acquire exemption for domestic servants and agricultural workers.<ref>Farm labor in Germany, 1810\u20131945; its historical development within the framework of agricultural and social policy by Frieda Wunderlich</ref>\n\nWith the ''Verordnung'' of 3 February 1919, the Ebert government reintroduced the original structure of the health insurance boards according to an 1883 law, with one-third employers and two-thirds members (i.e. workers).<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=64U_dlAI6g0C&pg=PA126&dq=Germany+compulsory+health+insurance+february+1919#v=onepage&q=Germany%20compulsory%20health%20insurance%20february%201919&f=false|title=Two Centuries of Solidarity|isbn=9789052603445|last1=Companje|first1=Karel-Peter|last2=Veraghtert|first2=Karel|last3=Widdershoven|first3=Brigitte|year=2009}}</ref> From 28 June 1919 health insurance committees became elected by workers themselves.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=BCYCYfHdBFQC&pg=PA58&dq=germany+law+1918+unfair+dismissal#v=onepage&q=germany%20law%201918%20unfair%20dismissal&f=false|title=Social Relations in the Estate Villages of Mecklenburg c. 1880\u20131924|isbn=9780754655039|last1=Constantine|first1=Simon|year=2007}}</ref> The Provisional Order of January 1919 concerning agricultural labour conditions fixed 2,900 hours as a maximum per year, distributed as eight, ten, and eleven hours per day in four-monthly periods.<ref>Industrial and Labour Information, Volume 20, International Labour Office, 1926</ref> A code of January 1919 bestowed upon land-labourers the same legal rights that industrial workers enjoyed, while a bill ratified that same year obliged the States to set up agricultural settlement associations which, as noted by [[Volker Berghahn]], \"were endowed with the priority right of purchase of farms beyond a specified size\".<ref>Modern Germany: society, economy and politics in the twentieth century by Volker R.

The ensuing street fighting left several dead and injured on both sides. The USPD leaders were outraged by what they believed was treachery by the MSPD, which, in their view, had joined with the anti-communist military to suppress the revolution. Thus, the USPD left the \"Council of the People's Deputies\" after only seven weeks. On 30 December, the split deepened when the [[Communist Party of Germany]] (KPD) was formed out of a number of radical left-wing groups, including the left wing of the USPD and the \"[[Spartacist League]]\" group.\n\nIn January, the Spartacist League and others in the streets of Berlin made more armed attempts to establish communism, known as the [[Spartacist uprising]]. Those attempts were put down by paramilitary ''[[Freikorps]]'' units consisting of volunteer soldiers. Bloody street fights culminated in the beating and shooting deaths of [[Rosa Luxemburg]] and [[Karl Liebknecht]] after their arrests on 15 January.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=Vlzg_5WteHoC&printsec=frontcover&dq=William+Pelz#v=onepage&q=William%20Pelz&f=false|title=Against Capitalism: The European Left on the March|publisher=[[Peter Lang (publisher)|Peter Lang]], New York|author=William A.

In this time, the radical left-wing parties, including the USPD and KPD, were barely able to get themselves organised, leading to a solid majority of seats for the MSPD moderate forces. To avoid the ongoing fights in Berlin, the National Assembly convened in the city of [[Weimar, Germany|Weimar]], giving the future Republic its unofficial name. The [[Weimar Constitution]] created a republic under a [[parliamentary republic|parliamentary republic system]] with the ''Reichstag'' elected by [[proportional representation]]. The democratic parties obtained a solid 80% of the vote.\n\nDuring the debates in Weimar, fighting continued. A [[Bavarian Soviet Republic|Soviet republic]] was declared in [[Munich]], but was quickly put down by ''Freikorps'' and remnants of the regular army. The fall of the [[Munich Soviet Republic]] to these units, many of which were situated on the extreme right, resulted in the growth of far-right movements and organisations in [[Bavaria]], including [[Organisation Consul]], the [[Nazi Party]], and societies of exiled Russian Monarchists. Sporadic fighting continued to flare up around the country. In eastern provinces, forces loyal to Germany's fallen Monarchy fought the republic, while militias of Polish nationalists fought for independence: [[Greater Poland Uprising (1918\u20131919)|Great Poland Uprising]] in [[Provinz Posen]] and three [[Silesian uprisings]] in [[Upper Silesia]].\n\nGermany lost the war because the country ran out of allies and its economic resources were running out; support among the population began to crumble in 1916 and by mid-1918 there was support for the war only among the die-hard monarchists and conservatives. The decisive blow came with the entry of the United States into the conflict, which made its vast industrial resources available to the beleaguered Allies. By late summer 1918 the German reserves were exhausted while fresh American troops arrived in France at the rate of 10,000 a day. Retreat and defeat were at hand, and the Army told the Kaiser to abdicate for it could no longer support him. Although in retreat, the German armies were still on French and Belgian territory when the war ended on 11 November. Ludendorf and Hindenburg soon proclaimed that it was the defeatism of the civilian population that had made defeat inevitable. The die-hard nationalists then blamed the civilians for betraying the army and the surrender. This was the \"[[stab-in-the-back myth]]\" that was unceasingly propagated by the right in the 1920s and ensured that many monarchists and conservatives would refuse to support the government of what they called the \"November criminals\".<ref>{{cite journal |first=Wilhelm |last=Diest |first2=E.

The severe food shortages improved little to none up until 1923.  Many German civilians expected life to return to prewar normalcy following the removal of the naval blockade in June 1919. Instead, the struggles induced by the First World War persisted for the decade following.  Throughout the war German officials made rash decisions to combat the growing hunger of the nation, most of which were highly unsuccessful. Examples include the nationwide pig slaughter, [[Schweinemord]], in 1915.  The rationale behind exterminating the population of swine was to decrease the use of potatoes and turnips for animal consumption, transitioning all foods toward human consumption. \n\nIn 1922, now three years after the German signing of the Treaty of Versailles, meat consumption in the country had not increased since the war era. 22&nbsp;kg per person per year was still less than half of the 52&nbsp;kg statistic in 1913, before the onset of the war.  German citizens felt the food shortages even deeper than during the war, because the reality of the nation contrasted so starkly with their expectations.  The burdens of World War I lightened little in the immediate years following, and with the onset of the Treaty of Versailles, coupled by mass inflation, Germany still remained in a crisis.  The continuity of pain showed the Weimar authority in a negative light, and public opinion was one of the main sources behind its failure.<ref>Heinzelmann, Ursula. Beyond Bratwurst: A History of Food in Germany.

Military-industrial activity had almost ceased, although controlled demobilisation kept unemployment at around one million. In part, the economic losses can also be attributed to the Allied blockade of Germany until the Treaty of Versailles.\n\nThe Allies permitted only low import levels of goods that most Germans could not afford.{{Citation needed|date=October 2011}} After four years of war and famine, many German workers were exhausted, physically impaired and discouraged. Millions were disenchanted with what they considered capitalism and hoping for a new era. Meanwhile, the currency depreciated, and would continue to depreciate following the French invasion of the Ruhr.{{Citation needed|date=October 2011}}\n\nThe treaty was signed June 28, 1919 and is easily divided into four categories: territorial issues, disarmament demands, reparations, and assignment of guilt. The German colonial empire was stripped and given over to Allied forces. The greater blow to Germans however was that they were forced to give up the territory of Alsace-Lorraine. Many German borderlands were demilitarized and allowed to self-determine. The German military was forced to have no more than 100,000 men with only 4,000 officers. Germany was forced to destroy all its fortifications in the West and was prohibited from having an air force, tanks, poison gas, and heavy artillery. Many ships were scuttled and submarines and dreadnoughts were prohibited. Germany was forced under Article 235 to pay 20 billion gold marks, about 4.5 billion dollars by 1921. Article 231 placed Germany and her allies with responsibility for causing all the loss and damage suffered by the Allies. While Article 235 angered many Germans, no part of the treaty was more fought over than Article 231.<ref>Vincent, C.  Paul (1997).

Explaining the rise of extreme nationalist movements in Germany shortly after the war, British historian [[Ian Kershaw]] points to the \"national disgrace\" that was \"felt throughout Germany at the humiliating terms imposed by the victorious Allies and reflected in the Versailles Treaty...with its confiscation of territory on the eastern border and even more so its 'guilt clause'.\"<ref>{{cite book|author=Ian Kershaw|title=Hitler, 1889\u20131936: Hubris|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=nV-N10gyoFwC&pg=PA136|year=2000|publisher=W.W. Norton|page=136|isbn=9780393320350}}</ref> [[Adolf Hitler]] repeatedly blamed the republic and its democracy for accepting the oppressive terms of this treaty. The Republic's first ''[[President of Germany (1919\u20131945)|Reichspr\u00e4sident]]'' (\"Reich President\"), [[Friedrich Ebert]] of the SPD, signed the new German constitution into law on 11 August 1919.\n\nThe new post-World War I Germany, stripped of all colonies, became 13% smaller in its European territory than its imperial predecessor. Of these losses, a large proportion consisted of provinces that were originally Polish, and Alsace-Lorraine, seized by Germany in 1870, where Germans constituted only part or a minority of local populations despite nationalist outrage at the fragmentation of Germany.\n\n=====Allied Rhineland occupation=====\n{{main|Allied occupation of the Rhineland}}\n\nThe occupation of the [[Rhineland]] took place following the [[Armistice with Germany]] of 11 November 1918. The occupying armies consisted of [[National Army (USA)|American]], [[Belgian Army|Belgian]], [[British Army|British]] and [[French Army|French]] forces.\n\nIn 1920, under massive French pressure, the [[Saar (League of Nations)|Saar]] was separated from the Rhine Province and administered by the [[League of Nations]] until a plebiscite in 1935, when the region was returned to the ''Deutsches Reich''. At the same time, in 1920, the districts of [[Eupen]] and [[Malmedy]] were transferred to [[Belgium]] (see [[German-Speaking Community of Belgium]]). Shortly after, France completely occupied the Rhineland, strictly controlling all important industrial areas.\n\n=====Reparations=====\nThe actual amount of reparations that Germany was obliged to pay out was not the 132&nbsp;billion marks decided in the London Schedule of 1921 but rather the 50&nbsp;billion marks stipulated in the A and B Bonds. Historian Sally Marks says the 112&nbsp;billion marks in \"C bonds\" were entirely chimerical\u2014a device to fool the public into thinking Germany would pay much more. The actual total payout from 1920 to 1931 (when payments were suspended indefinitely) was 20&nbsp;billion [[German gold mark]]s, worth about US$5&nbsp;billion or \u00a31&nbsp;billion British pounds. 12.5&nbsp;billion was cash that came mostly from loans from New York bankers. The rest was goods such as coal and chemicals, or from assets like railway equipment. The reparations bill was fixed in 1921 on the basis of a German capacity to pay, not on the basis of Allied claims. The highly publicised rhetoric of 1919 about paying for all the damages and all the veterans' benefits was irrelevant for the total, but it did determine how the recipients spent their share. Germany owed reparations chiefly to France, Britain, Italy and Belgium; the US Treasury received $100&nbsp;million.<ref>{{Cite journal |jstor = 4545835|title = The Myths of Reparations|journal = Central European History|volume = 11|issue = 3|pages = 231\u2013255|last1 = Marks|first1 = Sally|year = 1978|doi = 10.1017/S0008938900018707}}</ref>\n\n=====Hyperinflation=====\n{{further|Hyperinflation in the Weimar Republic}}\nIn the early post-war years, inflation was growing at an alarming rate, but the government simply printed more currency to pay debts. By 1923, the Republic claimed it could no longer afford the [[World War I reparations|reparations]] payments required by the Versailles Treaty, and the government defaulted on some payments. In response, French and Belgian troops [[Occupation of the Ruhr|occupied the Ruhr region]], Germany's most productive industrial region at the time, taking control of most mining and manufacturing companies in January 1923. Strikes were called, and passive resistance was encouraged. These strikes lasted eight months, further damaging both the economy and society.{{Citation needed|date = March 2016}}\n\nThe strike prevented some goods from being produced, but one industrialist, [[Hugo Stinnes]], was able to create a vast empire out of bankrupt companies. Because the production costs in Germany were falling almost hourly, the prices for German products were unbeatable. Stinnes made sure that he was paid in dollars, which meant that by mid-1923, his industrial empire was worth more than the entire German economy. By the end of the year, over two hundred factories were working full-time to produce paper for the spiralling bank note production. Stinnes' empire collapsed when the government-sponsored inflation was stopped in November 1923.{{Citation needed|date = March 2016}}\n\nIn 1919, one loaf of bread cost 1 mark; by 1923, the same loaf of bread cost 100&nbsp;billion marks.{{Citation needed|date = March 2016}}\n\n[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 102-00193, Inflation, Ein-Millionen-Markschein.jpg|thumb|upright=1.15|One-million mark notes used as notepaper, October 1923]]\nSince striking workers were paid benefits by the state, much additional currency was printed, fuelling a period of [[hyperinflation]]. The [[1920s German inflation]] started when Germany had no goods to trade. The government printed money to deal with the crisis; this meant payments within Germany were made with worthless paper money, and helped formerly great industrialists to pay back their own loans. This also led to pay raises for workers and for businessmen who wanted to profit from it. Circulation of money rocketed, and soon banknotes were being overprinted to a thousand times their nominal value and every town produced its own promissory notes; many banks and industrial firms did the same.{{Citation needed|date = March 2016}}\n\nThe value of the ''[[German papiermark|Papiermark]]'' had declined from 4.2 Marks per U.S. dollar in 1914 to one million per dollar by August 1923. This led to further criticism of the Republic. On 15 November 1923, a new currency, the ''[[German rentenmark|Rentenmark]]'', was introduced at the rate of one [[1000000000000 (number)|trillion]] (1,000,000,000,000) ''Papiermark'' for one ''Rentenmark'', an action known as [[redenomination]]. At that time, one U.S. dollar was equal to 4.2 ''Rentenmark''. Reparation payments were resumed, and the Ruhr was returned to Germany under the [[Locarno Treaties]], which defined the borders between Germany, France, and Belgium.\n\n====Political turmoil====\n{{Unreferenced section|date=October 2011}}\n[[File:50 millionen mark 1 september 1923.jpg|thumb|right|A 50 million mark banknote issued in 1923, worth approximately one U.S. dollar when issued, would have been worth approximately 12&nbsp;million U.S. dollars nine years earlier, but within a few weeks inflation made the banknote practically worthless.]]\n\nThe Republic was soon under attack from both [[Left-wing politics|left-]] and [[right-wing politics|right-wing]] sources. The radical left accused the ruling Social Democrats of having betrayed the ideals of the workers' movement by preventing a communist revolution and sought to overthrow the Republic and do so themselves. Various right-wing sources opposed any democratic system, preferring an authoritarian, autocratic state like the 1871 Empire. To further undermine the Republic's credibility, some right-wingers (especially certain members of the former [[officer corps]]) also blamed an [[Stab-in-the-back myth|alleged conspiracy]] of Socialists and Jews for Germany's defeat in World War I.\n\nIn the next five years, the central government, assured of the support of the Reichswehr, dealt severely with the occasional outbreaks of violence in Germany's large cities. The left claimed that the Social Democrats had betrayed the ideals of the revolution, while the army and the government-financed ''Freikorps'' committed hundreds of acts of gratuitous violence against striking workers.\n\nThe first challenge to the Weimar Republic came when a group of communists and anarchists took over the [[Bavaria]]n government in [[Munich]] and declared the creation of the [[Bavarian Soviet Republic]]. The uprising was brutally attacked by ''[[Freikorps]]'', which consisted mainly of ex-soldiers dismissed from the army and who were well-paid to put down forces of the Far Left. The ''Freikorps'' was an army outside the control of the government, but they were in close contact with their allies in the Reichswehr.\n\nOn 13 March 1920 during the [[Kapp Putsch]], 12,000 ''Freikorps'' soldiers occupied Berlin and installed [[Wolfgang Kapp]], a right-wing journalist, as chancellor. The national government fled to [[Stuttgart]] and called for a [[general strike]] against the putsch. The strike meant that no \"official\" pronouncements could be published, and with the civil service out on strike, the Kapp government collapsed after only four days on 17 March.\n\nInspired by the general strikes, a workers' [[Ruhr Uprising|uprising]] began in the [[Ruhr area|Ruhr region]] when 50,000 people formed a \"Red Army\" and took control of the province. The regular army and the ''Freikorps'' ended the uprising on their own authority. The rebels were campaigning for an extension of the plans to nationalise major industries and supported the national government, but the SPD leaders did not want to lend support to the growing USPD, who favoured the establishment of a socialist regime. The repression of an uprising of SPD supporters by the reactionary forces in the ''Freikorps'' on the instructions of the SPD ministers was to become a major source of conflict within the socialist movement and thus contributed to the weakening of the only group that could have withstood the National Socialist movement. Other rebellions were put down in March 1921 in [[Saxony]] and [[Hamburg]].\n\n[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 146-1972-062-01, Berlin, bettelnder Kriegsinvalide.jpg|thumb|A disabled war veteran in Berlin, 1923]]\nIn 1922, Germany signed the [[Treaty of Rapallo, 1922|Treaty of Rapallo]] with the Soviet Union, which allowed Germany to train military personnel in exchange for giving Russia military technology. This was against the [[Treaty of Versailles]], which limited Germany to 100,000 soldiers and no conscription, naval forces of 15,000 men, twelve destroyers, six battleships, and six cruisers, no [[submarine]]s or aircraft. However, Russia had pulled out of World War I against the Germans as a result of the 1917 Russian Revolution, and was excluded from the [[League of Nations]]. Thus, Germany seized the chance to make an ally. [[Walther Rathenau]], the Jewish [[Foreign Minister of Germany|Foreign Minister]] who signed the treaty, was assassinated two months later by two ultra-nationalist army officers.\n\nFurther pressure from the political right came in 1923 with the [[Beer Hall Putsch]], also called the Munich Putsch, staged by the [[Nazi Party]] under [[Adolf Hitler]] in Munich. In 1920, the [[German Workers' Party]] had become the [[National Socialist German Workers' Party]] (NSDAP), or [[Nazi party]], and would become a driving force in the collapse of Weimar. Hitler named himself as chairman of the party in July 1921. On 8 November 1923, the ''[[Kampfbund]]'', in a pact with [[Erich Ludendorff]], took over a meeting by Bavarian prime minister [[Gustav Ritter von Kahr|Gustav von Kahr]] at a beer hall in Munich.\n\nLudendorff and Hitler declared that the Weimar government was deposed and that they were planning to take control of Munich the following day. The 3,000 rebels were thwarted by the Bavarian authorities. Hitler was arrested and sentenced to five years in prison for high [[treason]], a minimum sentence for the charge. Hitler served less than eight months in a comfortable cell, receiving a daily stream of visitors before his release on 20 December 1924. While in jail, Hitler dictated ''[[Mein Kampf]]'', which laid out his ideas and future policies. Hitler now decided to focus on legal methods of gaining power.\n\n===Golden Era (1924\u20131929)===\n[[Gustav Stresemann]] was ''[[Chancellor of Germany|Reichskanzler]]'' for 100 days in 1923, and served as [[Minister for Foreign Affairs (Germany)|foreign minister]] from 1923 to 1929, a period of relative stability for the Weimar Republic, known in Germany as ''Goldene Zwanziger'' (\"[[Golden Twenties]]\"). Prominent features of this period were a growing economy and a consequent decrease in civil unrest.\n\nOnce civil stability had been restored, Stresemann began stabilising the German currency, which promoted confidence in the German economy and helped the recovery that was so ardently needed for the German nation to keep up with their reparation repayments, while at the same time feeding and supplying the nation.\n\nOnce the economic situation had stabilised, Stresemann could begin putting a permanent currency in place, called the ''[[Rentenmark]]'' (October 1923), which again contributed to the growing level of international confidence in the Weimar Republic's economy.\n\n[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 102-00231, Radioansprache von Kanzler Wilhelm Marx.jpg|thumb|[[Wilhelm Marx]]'s Christmas broadcast, December 1923]]\nTo help Germany meet reparation obligations, the [[Dawes Plan]] was created in 1924. This was an agreement between American banks and the German government in which the American banks lent money to German banks with German assets as collateral to help it pay reparations. The German railways, the National Bank and many industries were therefore mortgaged as securities for the stable currency and the loans.<ref name=Kitchen-241>Kitchen, ''Illustrated History of Germany'', Cambridge University Press, 1996, p. 241</ref>\n\nGermany was the first state to establish diplomatic relations with the new [[Soviet Union]]. Under the [[Treaty of Rapallo, 1922|Treaty of Rapallo]], Germany accorded it formal (''de jure'') recognition, and the two mutually cancelled all pre-war debts and renounced war claims.  In October 1925 the [[Treaty of Locarno]] was signed by Germany, France, Belgium, Britain and Italy; it recognised Germany's borders with France and Belgium. Moreover, Britain, Italy and Belgium undertook to assist France in the case that German troops marched into the demilitarised Rhineland. Locarno paved the way for Germany's admission to the [[League of Nations]] in 1926.<ref>Wolfgang Elz, \"Foreign policy\" in Anthony McElligott, ed.,  ''Weimar Germany'' (2009) pp. 50\u201377</ref> Germany signed arbitration conventions with France and Belgium and arbitration treaties with Poland and [[Czechoslovakia]], undertaking to refer any future disputes to an arbitration tribunal or to the [[Permanent Court of International Justice]].  Other foreign achievements were the evacuation of foreign troops from the Ruhr in 1925. In 1926, Germany was admitted to the League of Nations as a permanent member, improving her international standing and giving the right to vote on League matters.\n\nOverall trade increased and unemployment fell. Stresemann's reforms did not relieve the underlying weaknesses of Weimar but gave the appearance of a stable democracy. Even Stresemann's 'German People's party' failed to gain nationwide recognition, and instead featured in the 'flip-flop' coalitions. The Grand Coalition headed by Muller inspired some faith in the government, but that didn't last. Governments frequently lasted only a year, comparable to the political situation in France during the 1930s. The major weakness in constitutional terms was the inherent instability of the coalitions, which often fell prior to elections. The growing dependence on American finance was to prove fleeting, and Germany was one of the worst hit nations in the [[Great Depression]].\n\n===Culture===\n[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 183-K0623-0502-001, Berlin, Tanztee im \"Esplanade\".jpg|thumb|left|upright=1.15|The \"[[Golden Twenties]]\" in Berlin: a jazz band plays for a tea dance at the hotel Esplanade, 1926]]\nThe 1920s saw a remarkable cultural renaissance in Germany. During the worst phase of hyperinflation in 1923, the clubs and bars were full of speculators who spent their daily profits so they would not lose the value the following day. Berlin intellectuals responded by condemning the excesses of what they considered capitalism, and demanding revolutionary changes on the cultural scenery.\n\nInfluenced by the brief cultural explosion in the Soviet Union, German literature, cinema, theatre and musical works entered a phase of great creativity. Innovative street theatre brought plays to the public, and the [[cabaret]] scene and jazz band became very popular. According to the clich\u00e9, modern young women were [[Americanization|Americanized]], wearing makeup, short hair, smoking and breaking with traditional [[mores]]. The euphoria surrounding [[Josephine Baker]] in the metropolis of Berlin for instance, where she was declared an \"erotic [[goddess]]\" and in many ways admired and respected, kindled further \"ultramodern\" sensations in the minds of the German public.<ref>{{cite web |title=Josephine Baker in Berlin |url=http://www.cabaret-berlin.com/?p=440 |work=Cabaret Berlin \u2013 Exploring the entertainment of the Weimar era |date=8 December 2010 |accessdate=11 June 2011}}</ref> Art and a new type of architecture taught at \"[[Bauhaus]]\" schools reflected the new ideas of the time, with artists such as [[George Grosz]] being fined for defaming the military and for [[blasphemy]].\n\nArtists in Berlin were influenced by other contemporary progressive cultural movements, such as the Impressionist and Expressionist painters in Paris, as well as the Cubists. Likewise, American progressive architects were admired. Many of the new buildings built during this era followed a straight-lined, geometrical style. Examples of the new architecture include the [[Bauhaus Dessau Foundation|Bauhaus Building]] by [[Walter Gropius|Gropius]], [[Gro\u00dfes Schauspielhaus|Grosses Schauspielhaus]], and the [[Einstein Tower]].<ref>{{cite book |last=Delmer |first=Sefton |title=Weimar Germany: Democracy on Trial |year=1972 |publisher=Macdonald |location=London| pages=82\u201393}}</ref>\n\nNot everyone, however, was happy with the changes taking place in [[Weimar culture]]. Conservatives and reactionaries feared that Germany was betraying its traditional values by adopting popular styles from abroad, particularly those Hollywood was popularizing in American films, while New York became the global capital of fashion. Germany was more susceptible to Americanization, because of the close economic links brought about by the Dawes plan.{{citation needed|date=January 2019}}\n\nIn 1929, three years after receiving the 1926 [[Nobel Peace Prize]], Stresemann died of a heart attack at age 51. When the New York Stock Exchange crashed in October 1929, American loans dried up and the sharp decline of the German economy brought the \"Golden Twenties\" to an abrupt end.\n\n===Social policy under Weimar===\nA wide range of progressive social reforms were carried out during and after the revolutionary period. In 1919, legislation provided for a maximum working 48-hour workweek, restrictions on night work, a half-holiday on Saturday, and a break of thirty-six hours of continuous rest during the week.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://archive.org/stream/labourundernazir033210mbp/labourundernazir033210mbp_djvu.txt|title=Full text of \"Labour Under Nazi Rule\"|publisher=Oxford At The Clarendon Press.}}</ref> That same year, health insurance was extended to wives and daughters without their own income, people only partially capable of gainful employment, people employed in private cooperatives, and people employed in public cooperatives.<ref name=\"ministerial-leadership.org\">http://www.ministerial-leadership.org/sites/default/files/resources_and_tools/10%20german%20health%20insu.pdf</ref> A series of progressive tax reforms were introduced under the auspices of Matthias Erzberger, including increases in taxes on capital<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=p5x5Cu4zuaoC&pg=PA39&dq=erzberger+tax+reforms#v=onepage&q=erzberger%20tax%20reforms&f=false|title=Dying of Money|isbn=9781457502668|last1=Parsson|first1=Jens O.|date=March 2011}}</ref> and an increase in the highest income tax rate from 4% to 60%.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-hHIAAAAQBAJ&pg=PA132&dq=erzberger+inheritance+tax+1919#v=onepage&q=erzberger%20inheritance%20tax%201919&f=false|title=Decoding Modern Consumer Societies|isbn=9781137013002|last1=Berghoff|first1=H.|last2=Spiekermann|first2=U.|date=2 January 2012}}</ref> Under a governmental decree of 3 February 1919, the German government met the demand of the veterans' associations that all aid for the disabled and their dependents be taken over by the central government<ref>American Journal of Care for Cripples, Volume 8, Douglas C.

The economy was supported by the granting of loans through the [[Dawes Plan]] (1924) and the [[Young Plan]] (1929). When American banks withdrew their loans to German companies, the onset of severe unemployment could not be stopped by conventional economic measures. Unemployment grew rapidly, at 4 million in 1930,<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://spartacus-educational.com/GERunemployment.htm|title=Unemployment in Nazi Germany|work=Spartacus Educational|access-date=2017-03-01|language=en}}</ref> and in September 1930 a political earthquake shook the republic to its foundations. The [[Nazi Party]] (NSDAP) entered the Reichstag with 19% of the popular vote and made the fragile coalition system by which every chancellor had governed unworkable. The last years of the Weimar Republic were stamped by even more political instability than in the previous years. The administrations of Chancellors [[Heinrich Br\u00fcning|Br\u00fcning]], [[Franz von Papen|Papen]], [[Kurt von Schleicher|Schleicher]] and, from 30 January to 23 March 1933, [[Adolf Hitler|Hitler]] governed through [[Decree|presidential decree]] rather than through [[Reichstag (Weimar Republic)|parliamentary]] consultation.\n\n====Br\u00fcning's policy of deflation (1930\u20131932)====\nOn 29 March 1930, after months of lobbying by General [[Kurt von Schleicher]] on behalf of the military, the finance expert [[Heinrich Br\u00fcning]] was appointed as M\u00fcller's successor by ''[[President of Germany (1919\u20131945)|Reichspr\u00e4sident]]'' [[Paul von Hindenburg]]. The new government was expected to lead a political shift towards [[conservatism]].\n\nAs Br\u00fcning had no majority support in the ''Reichstag'', he became, through the use of [[Article 48 (Weimar Constitution)|the emergency powers granted to the ''Reichspr\u00e4sident'' (Article 48)]] by [[Weimar Constitution|the constitution]], the first Weimar chancellor to operate independently of parliament. This made him dependent on the ''Reichspr\u00e4sident'', Hindenburg.<ref name=\"ThomasAdam\">Thomas Adam, ''Germany and the Americas: Culture, Politics, and History'', 2005, {{ISBN|1-85109-633-7}}, p. 185</ref> After a bill to reform the Reich's finances was opposed by the ''Reichstag'', it was made an emergency [[decree]] by Hindenburg. On 18 July, as a result of opposition from the SPD, [[Communist Party of Germany|KPD]], [[German National People's Party|DNVP]] and the small contingent of [[Nazi Party|NSDAP]] members, the ''Reichstag'' again rejected the bill by a slim margin. Immediately afterward, Br\u00fcning submitted the president's decree that the ''Reichstag'' be dissolved. The consequent [[German federal election, 1930|general election on 14 September]] resulted in an enormous political shift within the ''Reichstag'': 18.3% of the vote went to the NSDAP, five times the percentage won in 1928. As a result, it was no longer possible to form a pro-republican majority, not even with a [[grand coalition]] that excluded the KPD, DNVP and NSDAP. This encouraged an escalation in the number of public demonstrations and instances of paramilitary violence organised by the NSDAP.\n[[File:Bundesarchiv B 145 Bild-P049500, Berlin, Aufmarsch der SA in Spandau.jpg|thumb|The [[Sturmabteilung|SA]] had nearly two million members at the end of 1932.]]\nBetween 1930 and 1932, Br\u00fcning tried to reform the Weimar Republic without a parliamentary majority, governing, when necessary, through the President's emergency decrees. In line with the contemporary economic theory (subsequently termed \"[[Causes of the Great Depression#Leave-it-alone liquidationism (1929\u201333)|leave-it-alone liquidationism]]\"), he enacted a draconian policy of [[deflation]] and [[Austerity|drastically cutting state expenditure]].<ref name=\"ThomasAdam\" /> Among other measures, he completely halted all public grants to the obligatory unemployment insurance introduced in 1927, resulting in workers making higher contributions and fewer benefits for the unemployed.

His primary goal was to remove Germany's reparation payments by convincing the Allies that they could no longer be paid.<ref>Hans Ulrich Wehler, Deutsche Gesellschaftsgeschichte, Band 4, 1.

Even healthy companies, therefore, may appear over-indebted and facing bankruptcy.<ref name=\"Ursulattner\">Ursula B\u00fcttner, Weimar: die \u00fcberforderte Republik, Klett-Cotta, 2008, {{ISBN|978-3-608-94308-5}}, p. 424</ref> The consensus today is that Br\u00fcning's policies exacerbated the German economic crisis and the population's growing frustration with democracy, contributing enormously to the increase in support for Hitler's NSDAP.<ref name=\"ThomasAdam\" />\n\nMost German capitalists and landowners originally supported the conservative experiment more from the belief that conservatives would best serve their interests rather than any particular liking for Br\u00fcning. As more of the working and middle classes turned against Br\u00fcning, however, more of the capitalists and landowners declared themselves in favour of his opponents Hitler and [[Alfred Hugenberg|Hugenberg]]. By late 1931, the conservative movement was dead and Hindenburg and the ''[[Reichswehr]]'' had begun to contemplate dropping Br\u00fcning in favour of accommodating Hugenberg and Hitler. Although Hindenburg disliked Hugenberg and despised Hitler, he was no less a supporter of the sort of anti-democratic counter-revolution that the DNVP and NSDAP represented.<ref name=\"Rosenberg\">{{cite book |last=Rosenberg |first=Arthur |authorlink=Arthur Rosenberg |title=A History of The German Republic |publisher=Methuen |year=1936 |location=London}}</ref> In April 1932, Br\u00fcning had actively supported Hindenburg's successful campaign against Hitler for re-election as ''Reichspr\u00e4sident'';<ref>Unlike the ''Reichskanzler'', the ''Reichspr\u00e4sident'' was elected by a direct popular vote.</ref> five weeks later, on 20 May 1932, he had lost Hindenburg's support and duly resigned as ''Reichskanzler''.\n\n====Papen deal====\nHindenburg then appointed [[Franz von Papen]] as new ''Reichskanzler''. Papen lifted the ban on the NSDAP's [[Sturmabteilung|SA]] paramilitary, imposed after the street riots, in an unsuccessful attempt to secure the backing of Hitler.{{citation needed|date=May 2016}}\n\nPapen was closely associated with the industrialist and land-owning classes and pursued an extremely conservative policy along Hindenburg's lines. He appointed as ''Reichswehr'' Minister [[Kurt von Schleicher]], and all the members of the new cabinet were of the same political opinion as Hindenburg. The government was expected to assure itself of the co-operation of Hitler. Since the republicans were not yet ready to take action, the Communists did not want to support the republic and the conservatives had shot their political bolt, Hitler and Hugenberg were certain to achieve power.{{citation needed|reason=Who claims that it was certain?|date=May 2016}}\n\n====Elections of July 1932====\nBecause most parties opposed the new government, Papen had the ''[[Reichstag (Weimar Republic)|Reichstag]]'' dissolved and called for new elections. [[German federal election, July 1932|The general elections on 31 July 1932]] yielded major gains for the [[Communist Party of Germany|Communists]], and for the Nazis, who won 37.3% of the vote\u2014their [[Nazi Party#Federal election results|high-water mark in a free election]]. The Nazi party then supplanted the [[Social Democratic Party of Germany|Social Democrats]] as the largest party in the ''Reichstag'', although it did not gain a majority.\n\nThe immediate question was what part the now large Nazi Party would play in the Government of the country. The party owed its huge increase to growing support from middle-class people, whose traditional parties were swallowed up by the Nazi Party. The millions of radical adherents at first forced the Party towards the Left. They wanted a renewed Germany and a new organisation of German society. The left of the Nazi party strove desperately against any drift into the train of such capitalist and feudal reactionaries. Therefore, Hitler refused ministry under Papen, and demanded the chancellorship for himself, but was rejected by Hindenburg on 13 August 1932. There was still no majority in the ''Reichstag'' for any government; as a result, the ''Reichstag'' was dissolved and elections took place once more in the hope that a stable majority would result. {{Citation needed|date=December 2017}}\n\n====Schleicher cabinet====\n[[German federal election, November 1932|The 6 November 1932 elections]] yielded 33% for the Nazis,<ref name=\"Evans\">{{cite book |last=Evans |first=Richard J. |authorlink=Richard J.

Franz von Papen stepped down and was succeeded as Chancellor (''Reichskanzler'') by General [[Kurt von Schleicher]] on 3 December. Schleicher, a retired army officer, had developed in an atmosphere of semi-obscurity and intrigue that encompassed the Republican military policy. He had for years been in the camp of those supporting the Conservative counter-revolution. Schleicher's bold and unsuccessful plan was to build a majority in the ''Reichstag'' by uniting the [[trade unionist]] left wings of the various parties, including that of the Nazis led by [[Gregor Strasser]]. This policy did not prove successful either.\n\n[[File:Plakat Hugenberg Papen Seldte 1933.jpg|thumb|upright=0.9|Poster for the nationalist \"Black\u2013White\u2013Red\" coalition of [[Alfred Hugenberg]] ([[German National People's Party|DNVP]] leader), [[Franz von Papen]], and [[Franz Seldte]]]]\n\nIn this brief Presidential Dictatorship intermission, Schleicher assumed the role of \"Socialist General\" and entered into relations with the Christian Trade Unions, the relativley left of the Nazi party, and even with the Social Democrats. Schleicher planned for a sort of labour government under his Generalship. But the ''Reichswehr'' officers were not prepared for this, the working class had a natural distrust of their future allies, and the great capitalists and landowners also did not like the plans.\n\nHitler learned from Papen that the general had not received from Hindenburg the authority to abolish the ''Reichstag'' parliament, whereas any majority of seats did. The cabinet (under a previous interpretation of Article 48) ruled without a sitting ''Reichstag'', which could vote only for its own dissolution. Hitler also learned that all past crippling Nazi debts were to be relieved by German big business.\n\nOn 22 January, Hitler's efforts to persuade [[Oskar von Hindenburg]], the President's son and confidant, included threats to bring criminal charges over estate taxation irregularities at the President's Neudeck estate; although {{convert|5000|acre|km2|abbr=on}} extra were soon allotted to Hindenburg's property. Outmaneuvered by Papen and Hitler on plans for the new cabinet, and having lost Hindenburg's confidence, Schleicher asked for new elections. On 28 January, Papen described Hitler to [[Paul von Hindenburg]] as only a minority part of an alternative, Papen-arranged government. The four great political movements, the SPD, Communists, [[Centre Party (Germany)|Centre]], and the Nazis were in opposition.\n\nOn 29 January, Hitler and Papen thwarted a last-minute threat of an officially sanctioned ''Reichswehr'' takeover, and on 30 January 1933 Hindenburg accepted the new Papen-Nationalist-Hitler coalition, with the Nazis holding only three of eleven Cabinet seats: Hitler as Chancellor, [[Wilhelm Frick]] as Minister of the Interior and [[Hermann G\u00f6ring]] as Minister Without Portfolio. Later that day, the first cabinet meeting was attended by only two political parties, representing a minority in the ''Reichstag'': The Nazis and the [[German National People's Party]] (DNVP), led by [[Alfred Hugenberg]], with 196 and 52 seats respectively. Eyeing the Catholic [[Centre Party (Germany)|Centre Party]]'s 70 (plus 20 [[Bavarian People's Party|BVP]]) seats, Hitler refused their leader's demands for constitutional \"concessions\" (amounting to protection) and planned for dissolution of the ''Reichstag''.\n\nHindenburg, despite his misgivings about the Nazis' goals and about Hitler as a personality, reluctantly agreed to Papen's theory that, with Nazi popular support on the wane, Hitler could now be controlled as Chancellor. This date, dubbed by the Nazis as the ''[[Machtergreifung]]'' (seizure of power), is commonly seen as the beginning of [[Nazi Germany]].\n\n===End of the Weimar Republic===\n\n====Hitler's chancellorship (1933)====\nHitler was sworn in as [[Chancellor]] on the morning of 30 January 1933 in what some observers later described as a brief and indifferent ceremony. By early February, a mere week after Hitler's assumption of the chancellorship, the government had begun to clamp down on the opposition. Meetings of the left-wing parties were banned and even some of the moderate parties found their members threatened and assaulted. Measures with an appearance of legality suppressed the Communist Party in mid-February and included the plainly illegal arrests of ''Reichstag'' deputies.\n\nThe [[Reichstag fire]] on 27 February was blamed by Hitler's government on the Communists. Hitler used the ensuing state of emergency to obtain the presidential assent of Hindenburg to issue the [[Reichstag Fire Decree]] the following day. The decree invoked [[Article 48 (Weimar Constitution)|Article 48]] of the [[Weimar Constitution]] and \"indefinitely suspended\" a number of constitutional protections of civil liberties, allowing the Nazi government to take swift action against political meetings, arresting and killing the Communists.\n\nHitler and the Nazis exploited the German state's broadcasting and aviation facilities in a massive attempt to sway the electorate, but this election yielded a scant majority of 16 seats for the coalition. At the [[German federal election, March 1933|''Reichstag'' elections]], which took place on 5 March 1933, the NSDAP obtained 17&nbsp;million votes. The Communist, Social Democrat and Catholic Centre votes stood firm. This was the last multi-party election of the Weimar Republic and the last multi-party all-German election for 57 years.\n\nHitler addressed disparate interest groups, stressing the necessity for a definitive solution to the perpetual instability of the Weimar Republic. He now blamed Germany's problems on the Communists, even threatening their lives on 3 March. Former Chancellor [[Heinrich Br\u00fcning]] proclaimed that his Centre Party would resist any constitutional change and appealed to the President for an investigation of the ''Reichstag'' fire. Hitler's successful plan was to induce what remained of the now Communist-depleted Reichstag to grant him, and the Government, the authority to issue decrees with the force of law. The hitherto Presidential Dictatorship hereby was to give itself a new legal form.\n\nOn 15 March, the first [[cabinet meeting]] was attended by the two coalition parties, representing a minority in the ''Reichstag'': The Nazis and the [[German National People's Party|DNVP]] led by [[Alfred Hugenberg]] (288 + 52 seats). According to the [[Nuremberg Trials]], this cabinet meeting's first order of business was how at last to achieve the complete counter-revolution by means of the constitutionally allowed [[Enabling Act of 1933|Enabling Act]], requiring a 66% parliamentary majority. This Act would, and did, lead Hitler and the [[NSDAP]] toward his goal of unfettered dictatorial powers.<ref>As Kershaw notes (p. 468 {{Full citation needed|date=July 2014}}), after the passage of the Act, \"Hitler was still far from wielding absolute power. But vital steps toward consolidating his dictatorship now followed in quick succession.\"</ref>\n\n====Hitler cabinet meeting in mid-March====\nAt the cabinet meeting on 15 March, Hitler introduced the [[Enabling Act of 1933|Enabling Act]], which would have authorised the cabinet to enact legislation without the approval of the ''Reichstag''. Meanwhile, the only remaining question for the Nazis was whether the Catholic Centre Party (''Zentrum'') would support the Enabling Act in the ''Reichstag'', thereby providing the \u2154 majority required to ratify a law that amended the constitution. Hitler expressed his confidence to win over the Centre's votes. Hitler is recorded at the Nuremberg Trials as being sure of eventual Centre Party Germany capitulation and thus rejecting of the DNVP's suggestions to \"balance\" the majority through further arrests, this time of Social Democrats. Hitler, however, assured his coalition partners that arrests would resume after the elections and, in fact, some 26 SPD Social Democrats were physically removed. After meeting with Centre leader Monsignor [[Ludwig Kaas]] and other Centre Trade Union leaders daily and denying them a substantial participation in the government, negotiation succeeded in respect of guarantees towards Catholic civil-servants and education issues.\n\nAt the last internal Centre meeting prior to the debate on the Enabling Act, Kaas expressed no preference or suggestion on the vote, but as a way of mollifying opposition by Centre members to the granting of further powers to Hitler, Kaas somehow arranged for a letter of constitutional guarantee from Hitler himself prior to his voting with the centre ''en bloc'' in favour of the [[Enabling Act of 1933|Enabling Act]]. This guarantee was not ultimately given. Kaas, the party's chairman since 1928, had strong connections to the [[Vatican City|Vatican]] Secretary of State, later [[Pope Pius XII]]. In return for pledging his support for the act, Kaas would use his connections with the Vatican to set in train and draft the [[Holy See]]'s long desired ''[[Reichskonkordat]]'' with Germany (only possible with the co-operation of the Nazis).\n\nLudwig Kaas is considered along with Papen as being one of the two most important political figures in the creation of a [[National Socialist German Workers Party|National Socialist]] dictatorship.<ref name=\"vKlemperer\">{{cite book|last=Klemperer|first=Klemens von|title=German Resistance Against Hitler:The Search for Allies Abroad 1938\u20131945|publisher= OUP / Clarendon Press|year=1992|location=Oxford|isbn=0-19-821940-7}}</ref>\n\n====Enabling Act negotiations====\nOn 20 March, negotiation began between Hitler and Frick on one side and the Catholic Centre Party (''Zentrum'') leaders\u2014Kaas, Stegerwald and Hackelsburger on the other. The aim was to settle on conditions under which Centre would vote in favour of the [[Enabling Act]]. Because of the Nazis' narrow majority in the ''Reichstag'', Centre's support was necessary to receive the required two-thirds majority vote. On 22 March, the negotiations concluded; Hitler promised to continue the existence of the German states, agreed not to use the new grant of power to change the constitution, and promised to retain ''Zentrum'' members in the civil service. Hitler also pledged to protect the Catholic confessional schools and to respect the concordats signed between the [[Holy See]] and [[Bavaria]] (1924), [[Prussia]] (1929) and [[Baden]] (1931). Hitler also agreed to mention these promises in his speech to the ''Reichstag'' before the vote on the Enabling Act.\n\nThe ceremonial opening of the ''Reichstag'' on 21 March was held at the [[Garrison Church (Potsdam)|Garrison Church]] in [[Potsdam]], a shrine of [[Prussia]]nism, in the presence of many [[Junker]] landowners and representatives of the imperial military caste. This impressive and often emotional spectacle\u2014orchestrated by [[Joseph Goebbels]]\u2014aimed to link Hitler's government with Germany's imperial past and portray National Socialism as a guarantor of the nation's future. The ceremony helped convince the \"old guard\" Prussian military elite of Hitler's homage to their long tradition and, in turn, produced the relatively convincing view that Hitler's government had the support of Germany's traditional protector\u2014the Army. Such support would publicly signal a return to conservatism to curb the problems affecting the Weimar Republic, and that stability might be at hand. In a cynical and politically adroit move, Hitler bowed in apparently respectful humility before President and Field Marshal [[Paul von Hindenburg|Hindenburg]].\n\n====Passage of the Enabling Act====\nThe ''Reichstag'' convened on 23 March 1933, and in the midday opening, Hitler made a historic speech, appearing outwardly calm and conciliatory. Hitler presented an appealing prospect of respect towards Christianity by paying tribute to the Christian faiths as \"essential elements for safeguarding the soul of the German people\". He promised to respect their rights and declared that his government's \"ambition is a peaceful accord between [[Separation of church and state|Church and State]]\" and that he hoped \"to improve [their] friendly relations with the [[Holy See]]\". This speech aimed especially at the future recognition by the named [[Holy See]] and therefore to the votes of the Centre Party addressing many concerns Kaas had voiced during the previous talks. Kaas is considered to have had a hand therefore in the drafting of the speech.<ref name=\"vKlemperer\"/> Kaas is also reported as voicing the Holy See's desire for Hitler as bulwark against [[atheist]]ic Russian [[nihilism]] previously as early as May 1932.<ref>{{cite book|last=Mowrer|first=Edgar Ansel|authorlink=Edgar Ansel Mowrer| title=Triumph and Turmoil|url=https://archive.org/details/triumphturmoilpe0000mowr|url-access=registration|year=1970|publisher=Allen & Unwin|location=London|page=[https://archive.org/details/triumphturmoilpe0000mowr/page/209 209]|isbn= 0-04-920026-7}}</ref>\n\nHitler promised that the Act did not threaten the existence of either the ''[[Reichstag (Weimar Republic)|Reichstag]]'' or the ''[[Reichsrat (Germany)|Reichsrat]]'', that the authority of the President remained untouched and that the ''[[States of Germany|L\u00e4nder]]'' would not be abolished. During an adjournment, the other parties (notably the Centre) met to discuss their intentions.<ref>Kershaw pp. 467\u201368.</ref>\n\nIn the debate prior to the vote on the Enabling Act, Hitler orchestrated the full political menace of his paramilitary forces like the [[Sturmabteilung|storm division]] in the streets to intimidate reluctant ''Reichstag'' deputies into approving the Enabling Act. The Communists' 81 seats had been empty since the ''Reichstag'' Fire Decree and other lesser known procedural measures, thus excluding their anticipated \"No\" votes from the balloting. [[Otto Wels]], the leader of the Social Democrats, whose seats were similarly depleted from 120 to below 100, was the only speaker to defend democracy and in a futile but brave effort to deny Hitler the \u2154 majority, he made a speech critical of the abandonment of democracy to dictatorship. At this, Hitler could no longer restrain his wrath.<ref>{{cite book |title=The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich |authorlink=William L. Shirer |last=Shirer |first=William L. |publisher=[[Simon & Schuster]] |location= New York |year=1960 |isbn=0-671-72868-7|title-link=The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich }}</ref>\n\nIn his retort to Wels, Hitler abandoned earlier pretence at calm statesmanship and delivered a characteristic screaming diatribe, promising to exterminate all Communists in Germany and threatening Wels' Social Democrats as well. He did not even want their support for the bill. \"Germany will become free, but not through you,\" he shouted.<ref>Kershaw p. 468.</ref> Meanwhile, Hitler's promised written guarantee to Monsignor Kaas was being typed up, it was asserted to Kaas, and thereby Kaas was persuaded to silently deliver the Centre bloc's votes for the Enabling Act anyway. The Act\u2014formally titled the \"Act for the Removal of Distress from People and Reich\"\u2014was passed by a vote of 441 to 94. Only the SPD had voted against the Act. Every other member of the ''Reichstag'', whether from the largest or the smallest party, voted in favour of the Act. It went into effect the following day, 24 March.\n\n====Consequences====\n{{main|Nazi Germany}}\nThe passage of the [[Enabling Act of 1933]] is widely considered to mark the end of the Weimar Republic and the beginning of the Nazi era. It empowered the cabinet to legislate without the approval of the Reichstag or the President, and to enact laws that were contrary to the constitution. Before the March 1933 elections, Hitler had persuaded Hindenburg to promulgate the [[Reichstag Fire Decree]] using [[Article 48]], which empowered the government to restrict \"the rights of habeas corpus [...] freedom of the press, the freedom to organise and assemble, the privacy of postal, telegraphic and telephonic communications\" and legalised search warrants and confiscation \"beyond legal limits otherwise prescribed\". This was intended to forestall any action against the government by the Communists. Hitler used the provisions of the Enabling Act to pre-empt possible opposition to his dictatorship from other sources, in which he was mostly successful.\n\nThe Nazis in power brought almost all major organisations into line under Nazi control or direction, which was termed  ''[[Gleichschaltung]]''.\n\nThe constitution of 1919 was never formally repealed, but the Enabling Act meant that it was a dead letter.  Those articles of the Weimar constitution (which dealt with the state's relationship to various Christian churches) remain part of the German Basic Law.\n\n==Reasons for failure==\nThe reasons for the Weimar Republic's collapse are the subject of continuing debate. It may have been doomed from the beginning since even moderates disliked it and extremists on both the left and right loathed it, a situation often referred to as a \"democracy without democrats\".<ref>{{cite book |last=Primoratz |first=Igor |date=2008-05-08 |title=Patriotism: Philosophical and Political Perspectives |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Ob8oDAAAQBAJ&pg=PA98&lpg=PA98#v=onepage&q&f=false |publisher=Routledge |page=98 |isbn=978-0754671220 }}</ref> Germany had limited democratic traditions, and Weimar democracy was widely seen as chaotic. Since Weimar politicians had been blamed for the ''Dolchsto\u00df'' (\"[[Stab-in-the-back myth|stab-in-the-back]]\"), a widely believed theory that Germany's surrender in World War I had been the unnecessary act of traitors, the popular legitimacy of the government was on shaky ground. As normal parliamentary lawmaking broke down and was replaced around 1930 by a series of [[Article 48 (Weimar Constitution)|emergency decrees]], the decreasing popular legitimacy of the government further drove voters to extremist parties.\n\nNo single reason can explain the failure of the Weimar Republic. The most commonly asserted causes can be grouped into three categories: economic problems, institutional problems, and the roles of specific individuals.\n\n===Economic problems===\n<!--This section is linked from [[W.E.B. Du Bois]]-->\n{{main|Dawes Plan|Reichsbank}}\nThe Weimar Republic had some of the most serious economic problems ever experienced by any Western democracy in history. Rampant [[hyperinflation]], massive unemployment, and a large drop in living standards were primary factors. From 1923 to 1929, there was a short period of economic recovery, but the [[Great Depression]] of the 1930s led to a worldwide recession. Germany was particularly affected because it depended heavily on American loans. In 1926, about 2 million Germans were unemployed, which rose to around 6&nbsp;million in 1932. Many blamed the Weimar Republic. That was made apparent when political parties on both right and left wanting to disband the Republic altogether made any democratic majority in Parliament impossible.\n\nThe Weimar Republic was severely affected by the [[Great Depression]]. The economic stagnation led to increased demands on Germany to repay the debts owed to the United States. As the Weimar Republic was very fragile in all its existence, the depression was devastating, and played a major role in the [[Nazi Party|Nazi]] takeover.\n\nMost Germans thought the [[Treaty of Versailles]] was a punishing and degrading document because it forced them to surrender resource-rich areas and pay massive amounts of compensation. The punitive reparations caused consternation and resentment, but the actual economic damage resulting from the Treaty of Versailles is difficult to determine. While the official reparations were considerable, Germany ended up paying only a fraction of them. However, the reparations damaged Germany's economy by discouraging market loans, which forced the Weimar government to finance its deficit by printing more currency, causing rampant hyperinflation. At the beginning of 1920, 50 Marks was equivalent to one US Dollar. By the end of 1923, one US Dollar was equal to 4,200,000,000,000 Marks.<ref>https://www.pmgnotes.com/news/article/7334/German-Vampire-Note/</ref> In addition, the rapid disintegration of Germany in 1919 by the return of a disillusioned army, the rapid change from possible victory in 1918 to defeat in 1919, and the political chaos may have lead to extreme nationalism. {{citation needed|date=April 2018}}\n\n[[Princeton University|Princeton]] historian [[Harold James (historian)|Harold James]] argues that there was a clear link between economic decline and people turning to extremist politics.<ref>James, Harold, \"Economic Reasons for the Collapse of the Weimar Republic\", in ''Weimar: Why Did German Democracy Fail'', ed. Ian Kershaw, Widenfeld and Nicolson, (London: 1990), pp. 30\u201357.</ref>\n\n===Institutional problems===\nIt is widely believed that the [[Weimar Constitution|1919 constitution]] had several weaknesses, making the eventual establishment of a dictatorship likely, but it is unknown whether a different constitution could have prevented the rise of the Nazi party. However, the 1949 West German constitution (the [[Basic Law of the Federal Republic of Germany]]) is generally viewed as a strong response to these flaws.\n* The institution of the ''Reichspr\u00e4sident'' was frequently considered as an ''Ersatzkaiser'' (\"substitute emperor\"), an attempt to replace the emperors with a similarly strong institution meant to diminish party politics. [[Article 48 (Weimar Constitution)|Article 48]] of the Constitution gave the President power to \"take all necessary steps\" if \"public order and security are seriously disturbed or endangered\". Although it was intended as an emergency clause, it was often used before 1933 to issue decrees without the support of Parliament (see above) and also made ''[[Gleichschaltung]]'' easier.\n* During the Weimar Republic, it was accepted that a law did not have to conform to the constitution as long as it had the support of two-thirds of parliament, the same majority needed to change the constitution (''verfassungsdurchbrechende Gesetze''). That was a precedent for the [[Enabling Act of 1933]]. The Basic Law of 1949 requires an explicit change of the wording, and it prohibits abolishing the basic rights or the federal structure of the republic.\n* The use of a [[proportional representation]] without large [[election threshold|thresholds]] meant a party with a small amount of support could gain entry into the ''[[Reichstag (Weimar Republic)|Reichstag]]''. That led to many small parties, some extremist, building political bases within the system. To counter the problem, the modern German Bundestag introduced a 5% [[election threshold|threshold limit]] for a party to gain parliamentary representation. However, the Reichstag of the monarchy was fractioned to a similar degree even if it was elected by [[majoritarian system|majority vote]] (under a [[two-round system]]). The republic fell not by the small parties but by the strength of the communists, conservatives and ultimately the national socialists.\n* The ''Reichstag'' could remove the ''Reichskanzler'' from office even if it was unable to agree on a successor. The use of such a [[motion of no confidence]] meant that since 1932, a government could not be held in office when the parliament came together. As a result, the 1949 ''Grundgesetz'' (\"Basic Law\") stipulates that a chancellor may not be removed by Parliament unless a successor is elected at the same time, known as a \"[[constructive vote of no confidence]]\".\n* The political parties started to have a role in creating a government only in October 1918. They were massively inexperienced.\n\n===Role of individuals===\nBr\u00fcning's economic policy from 1930 to 1932 has been the subject of much debate. It caused many Germans to identify the Republic with cuts in social spending and extremely liberal economics. Whether there were alternatives to this policy during the [[Great Depression]] is an open question.\n\n[[Paul von Hindenburg]] became ''Reichspr\u00e4sident'' in 1925. As he was an old style monarchist conservative, he had little love lost for the Republic,{{citation needed|date=November 2018}} but for the most part, he formally acted within the bounds of the constitution;{{citation needed|date=November 2018}} however, he ultimately\u2014on the advice of his son and others close to him\u2014appointed Hitler chancellor, thereby effectively ending the Republic. Additionally, Hindenburg's death in 1934 ended the last obstacle for Hitler to assume full power in the Weimar Republic.\n\n==Constituent states==\n{{Main|States of the Weimar Republic}}\n\nPrior to World War I, the [[States of the German Empire|constituent states of the German Empire]] were 22 smaller monarchies, three republican city-states and the Imperial territory of [[Alsace-Lorraine]]. After the territorial losses of the [[Treaty of Versailles]] and the German Revolution of 1918\u20131919, the remaining states continued as republics. The former [[Ernestine duchies]] continued briefly as republics before merging to form the state of [[Thuringia]] in 1920, except for [[Saxe-Coburg]], which became part of [[Bavaria]].\n\n{{Weimar Republic States|width=550|include_list=y}}\nThese states were gradually ''de facto'' abolished under the Nazi regime via the [[Gleichschaltung]] process, whereby they were effectively replaced by [[Gau (country subdivision)|Gaue]]. However, the city-state of [[Free City of L\u00fcbeck|L\u00fcbeck]] was formally incorporated into Prussia in 1937 following the [[Greater Hamburg Act]], apparently motivated by Hitler's personal dislike for the city. Most of the remaining states were formally dissolved by the Allies at the end of World War II and ultimately reorganised into the modern [[states of Germany]].{{citation needed|date=November 2018}}\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|Germany|1920s}}\n* [[W\u00fcrttemberg Landtag elections in the Weimar Republic]]\n* [[Timeline of the Weimar Republic]]\n* [[The 1920s Berlin Project]]\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist|30em}}\n\n==Further reading==\n{{refbegin|30em}}\n* {{cite book|authorlink=William Sheridan Allen|last=Allen|first=William Sheridan|title=The Nazi seizure of Power: the experience of a single German town, 1922\u20131945|url=https://archive.org/details/naziseizureofpow0000alle_m2p7|url-access=registration|location=New York, Toronto| publisher=F.
