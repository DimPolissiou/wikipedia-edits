It is part of [[Greater Toronto Area|Greater Toronto]] in the [[Golden Horseshoe]] region of [[Southern Ontario]].\n\nThe town was formed as one of many farming communities in the area, but also developed an industrial centre on the [[Northern Railway of Canada]]'s mainline, which was built in 1853 through what would become the downtown area.<ref>{{cite web |last1=McChesney |first1=Peggy |title=A Brief History of the Town of Newmarket |url=https://www.newmarket.ca/ThingsToDo/Documents/History%20-%20Terry%20Carter%20Compilation.pdf#page=3 |website=Newmarket |publisher=Town of Newmarket |accessdate=23 August 2019}}</ref>It also became a thriving market town with the arrival of the [[Metropolitan Street Railway (Toronto)|Metropolitan Street Railway]] in 1899.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Wyatt |first1=David |title=Toronto and York Radial Interurban |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180713073546/http://home.cc.umanitoba.ca/~wyatt/alltime/toronto-suburbs-on.html |website=All-Time List of Canadian Transit Systems |accessdate=23 August 2019}}</ref> Over time, the town developed into a primarily residential area, and the expansion of [[Ontario Highway 400]] to the west and the construction of [[Ontario Highway 404]] to the east increasingly turned it into a [[bedroom town]] since the 1980s. The province's Official Plan, however, includes growth in the business services and knowledge industries, as well as in the administrative, manufacturing and retail sectors.\n\nSome of Newmarket's most noticeable landmarks are the [[Upper Canada Mall]], [[Southlake Regional Health Centre]], the Main Street [[Heritage Conservation District]], the Fairy Lake Conservation Area, as well as many other parks and recreation areas.\n\n== History ==\nNewmarket's location on the [[Holland River]] long ago made the area a natural route of travel between [[Lake Ontario]] and [[Lake Simcoe]]. A major [[portage]] route, the [[Toronto Carrying-Place Trail]] ran one of its two routes down the [[Holland River|Holland]], through the Newmarket area, and over the [[Oak Ridges Moraine]] to the [[Rouge River (Ontario)|Rouge River]] and into Lake Ontario. A more widely used route ran down the western branch of the [[Holland River]], over the moraine, and down the [[Humber River (Ontario)|Humber River]]. In 1793, [[John Graves Simcoe]] travelled the trail, northward along the main route to the west, and south to [[York, Upper Canada|York]] (now [[Toronto]]) along the lesser used eastern route though Newmarket. Selecting the eastern route as the better of the two, Simcoe started construction of [[Yonge Street]] along the former trail in late 1795, starting in York in [[Toronto Harbour|Toronto Bay]], and ending at the newly named St. Albans ([[Holland Landing]]), north of Newmarket.\n\n[[File:John Bogart House three quarter BW view.JPG|thumbnail|left|The John Bogart House on Leslie Street is the oldest residential structure in Newmarket and the oldest two-storey residential building north of Toronto. It was built in 1811 and still serves as a house.]]\n\n===Early settlement===\nSome of the United States Quakers were interested in moving northward, disturbed by the violence they were expected to take part in during the [[American Revolution]]. In June 1800, Timothy Rogers, a [[Quaker]] from [[Vermont]], explored the area around the Holland River to find a suitable location for a new Quaker settlement. He, Samuel Lundy and their group of Religious Society of Friends received the grant of a large amount of land. In 1801 Rogers returned along with several Quaker families who had left their homes in [[Vermont]] and [[Pennsylvania]]. They settled here in 1801-1803.<ref name=\"ontarioplaques.com\">{{cite web|url=http://www.ontarioplaques.com/Plaques/Plaque_York14.html|title=Founding of Newmarket Historical Plaque |website=www.ontarioplaques.com| accessdate=May 1, 2018|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nIn 1801, the Quaker families acquired {{convert|8000|acres|ha}} around the Holland River.

Hill also built a [[Tanning (leather)|tannery]] just to the north of the mill, and the first general store and house, as well as additional mills.\n\nBy 1802, [[Elisha Beman]], who owned a great deal of land in the area, had begun to establish businesses.<ref name=\"ontarioplaques.com\"/> A mill was first and other businesses (including a [[distillery]]) soon followed. Mordecai Millar also built mills and Joseph Hill opened a tannery. During the [[War of 1812]] a resident, William Roe, was able to hide gold that was in the settlement's treasury, saving it from invading American troops. The war also helped bring some prosperity as the army purchased goods and food and hired locals to build structures.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Carter |first1=Robert Terence |title=Stories of Newmarket: An Old Ontario Town |publisher=Dundurn |page=76 |url=https://books.google.ca/books?id=IKwo5Fb7_YUC&printsec=frontcover&dq=Newmarket,+ontario+war+of+1812&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjI18aZt8fTAhVBw4MKHbG6DQ8Q6AEIIzAA#v=onepage&q=war%20of%201812&f=false |accessdate=13 November 2018}}</ref>\n\nBy 1814, the settlement had two frame and several log buildings used as residences.<ref name=\"electriccanadian.com\">{{cite web |url=http://www.electriccanadian.com/history/ontario/york/part03chap11.htm |title=History of Toronto and County of York in Ontario Part III: Town of Newmarket |accessdate=April 28, 2017 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170819060727/http://www.electriccanadian.com/history/ontario/york/part03chap11.htm |archivedate=August 19, 2017 }}</ref> The town continued to grow through the early 19th century, along with the formation of [[Aurora, Ontario|Aurora]] and [[Holland Landing, Ontario|Holland Landing]], and a market held in the current downtown location gave rise to the name \"Newmarket\".\n\nNewmarket played a central role in the [[Rebellions of 1837\u20131838]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://cfha.info/journal77p57.pdf |title=The War of 1812-14 and the Rebellion of 1837 from \u201cThe Story of Sharon\u201d |accessdate=April 28, 2017 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180501154110/http://cfha.info/journal77p57.pdf |archivedate=May 1, 2018 }}</ref><ref>{{cite book |title=The Rebellion of 1837 in Upper Canada : a collection of documents |year=1985 |publisher=Champlain Society in cooperation with the Ontario Heritage Foundation |isbn=0-88629-026-0 |pages=[https://archive.org/details/rebellionof1837i0000unse/page/182 182]\u2013186 |edition=Second Printing |url=https://archive.org/details/rebellionof1837i0000unse |url-access=registration |quote=Newmarket . |accessdate=13 November 2018}}</ref> The town was a focal point of discontent against the manipulations of the governing Family Compact, of whom it was said \"were robbing the country\". Rebel leader [[William Lyon Mackenzie]] organized a series of meetings leading to the Rebellion. During the first of these meetings, on August 3, 1837, Mackenzie delivered his first campaign speech from the veranda of the North American Hotel at the corner of Botsford and Main Streets. This speech is largely credited for being the spark to the rebellion as it was heard by about 600 farmers and others sympathetic to Mackenzie\u2019s cause, who later that year armed themselves and marched down Yonge St. to take the capital. A number of leaders from this area were [[Attainder|attainted]] for [[high treason]], convicted and [[Hanging|hanged]].<ref>{{cite book |title=History of Toronto and County of York, Ontario |year=1885 |publisher=C.

This would allow boats to connect from there to the [[Trent-Severn Waterway]] for eventual shipment south. The [[Newmarket Canal]] was almost complete by the summer of 1912, when it was cancelled by the incoming government of [[Robert Borden]]. Today, the locks are still visible and are known as the \"Ghost Canal\".

By the 1950s, Newmarket was experiencing a suburban building boom due to its proximity to Toronto. The population increased from 5,000 to 11,000 between 1950 and 1970.\n\nThe [[Regional Municipality of York]] was formed in 1971, increasing the size of Newmarket with land from the Township of East Gwillimbury, from the Township of King and from the Township of Whitchurch. \n<ref name=\"newmarket.ca\"/> The construction of [[Upper Canada Mall]] at the corner of Yonge Street and Davis Drive in 1974 started pulling the focal point of the town westward from the historic Downtown area along Main Street.\n\nBy the early 1980s, the historic Downtown area suffered as most businesses had built up in the area around Upper Canada Mall, with additional [[strip mall]]s developing directly across the Yonge Street/Davis Drive intersection to the south and southeast. A concerted effort to revitalize the historic Downtown area during the late 1980s was successful. More recently, a $2.3-million investment was made by the town in 2004 in streetscaping and infrastructure improvements to roads and sidewalks in the historic Downtown. The historic area of Downtown's Main Street is once again a major focal point of the town.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.thespec.com/news-story/6953845-newmarket-main-street-wins-great-places-in-canada-award/|title=Newmarket Main Street wins Great Places in Canada award|first=Chris|last=Simon|date=November 8, 2016|accessdate=May 1, 2018|via=www.thespec.com|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180501154111/https://www.thespec.com/news-story/6953845-newmarket-main-street-wins-great-places-in-canada-award/|archivedate=May 1, 2018}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.thestar.com/life/2015/09/21/story-pod-the-latest-addition-to-newmarkets-revitalized-downtown.html|title=Story Pod the latest addition to Newmarket\u2019s revitalized downtown - The Star|website=thestar.com|accessdate=May 1, 2018|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160124205046/http://www.thestar.com/life/2015/09/21/story-pod-the-latest-addition-to-newmarkets-revitalized-downtown.html|archivedate=January 24, 2016}}</ref>\n\nThe arrival of [[Ontario Highway 404|Highway 404]] reversed the westward movement, pulling development eastward again, and surrounding the formerly separate hamlet of [[Bogarttown, Ontario|Bogarttown]] at the intersection of Mulock Drive and Leslie Street.<ref name=\"Carter\">{{cite book|title=Stories of Newmarket: An Old Ontario Town|last=Carter|first=Robert Terence|publisher=[[Dundurn Press]]|year=2011|isbn=9781554888801\n}}</ref><!-- page 50 --> Since then, Newmarket has grown considerably, filling out in all directions. The town limits now run from [[Bathurst Street (Toronto)|Bathurst Street]] in the west to Highway 404 in the east, and from just south of Green Lane to just north of St. John's Sideroad, taking over the former hamlet of Armitage at Yonge Street south of Mulock Drive. The southern boundary of the town is contiguous with [[Aurora, Ontario|Aurora]] to the south.\n\nArmitage was the first settlement of [[King, Ontario|King]] township, named in honour of its first settler Amos Armitage.<ref name=\"Carter\" /><!-- page 50 --> He had been recruited by Timothy Rogers, a [[Loyalist (American Revolution)|Loyalist]] from [[Vermont]], who in 1801 had travelled along [[Yonge Street]] and found the area appealing, and so applied for and received a grant for land totalling 40 farms, each of {{convert|200|acre|km2|1}}.\n\nOther defunct communities once located within the modern boundaries of Newmarket include Garbut's Hill, Paddytown, Petchville, Pleasantville, and White Rose.<ref name=\"Carter\" /><!-- page 51-52 -->\n\n== Geography ==\nNewmarket's geographical coordinates are 44.05\u00b0N, 79.46\u00b0W, and its elevation above [[sea level]] is 252&nbsp;m.<ref>{{cite web |title=Newmarket, Canada Page |url=http://www.fallingrain.com/world/CA/08/Newmarket.html |publisher=Falling Rain Software, Ltd. |accessdate=13 November 2018}}</ref> It has an area of 38.33&nbsp;km\u00b2. The town is bounded on the south by [[Aurora, Ontario|Aurora]], on the west by [[King, Ontario|King]], on the north by [[East Gwillimbury]] and on the east by [[Whitchurch\u2013Stouffville]].\n\nThe main river in Newmarket is the [[East Holland River]] (known locally simply as \"The [[Holland River]]\"), and all other streams in the town are tributaries thereto. These include Bogart Creek, a brook that weaves its way into the town from the [[Oak Ridges Moraine]] by way of [[Bogarttown, Ontario|Bogarttown]], emptying into the Holland River in north-central Newmarket; Western creek, another brook rising just west of the town, and reaching the Holland River in the town's north end; Tannery Creek, a stream that joins the Holland River in south Newmarket after flowing through [[Aurora, Ontario|Aurora]]; and a number of other small watercourses.\n\nThere are two [[reservoir]]s in Newmarket; Fairy Lake (which is managed by the [[Lake Simcoe Region Conservation Authority]]), a favourite recreational area in the centre of town, is a former [[mill pond]] on the East Holland River; and Bogart Pond, also a former mill pond, is fed and drained by Bogart Creek in Bogarttown. Furthermore, the water level in the reach of the East Holland north of Davis Drive is controlled from an unfinished [[Newmarket Canal]] lock, now used as a [[weir]].\n\nNewmarket also lies south of and above the [[Glacial Lake Algonquin|Algonquin Shoreline]], where elevations suddenly drop off from the gently rolling hills that characterize much of Newmarket to the much flatter, lower land down below in the [[Holland Marsh]].\n\nThe land is characterized mainly by [[till|glacial deposits]] from the last [[ice age]], known as \"Newmarket Till\". The town is underlain mainly by sand and gravel, ground by the [[Ice sheet|icesheets]] that covered the area until about 10,000 years ago. No [[outcrop]]s are to be found anywhere in Newmarket, so deep are the glacial deposits.\n\n== Climate ==\nNewmarket has a [[humid continental climate]] ([[Humid continental climate#Koppen Dfb|K\u00f6ppen climate classification ''Dfb'']]), with four distinct seasons featuring cold, somewhat snowy winters and warm, humid summers. Precipitation is moderate and consistent in all seasons, although summers are a bit wetter than winter due to the moisture from the Gulf of Mexico and the Great Lakes.\n\n{{Weather box\n| collapsed    = yes\n| metric first = yes\n| single line  = yes\n| location     = Newmarket/King Smoke Tree &ndash; 1981&ndash;2010{{efn|Dates may vary.

They go by the name of the Newmarket Redmen and range from divisions of Tyke to Midget.\n\n=== Golf ===\nOne golf course is located within Newmarket's town limits; St. Andrew's Valley (a public club), which straddles the Aurora/Newmarket border. Glenway Country Club was a private club with a course within Newmarket's boundaries, but it was closed before the 2012 season and is slated for redevelopment.<ref>{{cite web|last=Latchford|first=Teresa|title=Glenway won\u2019t reopen in 2012|url=http://www.yorkregion.com/article/1059739--glenway-won-t-reopen-in-2012|work=Yorkregion.com|publisher=Metroland News|accessdate=November 13, 2012}}</ref>\n\nThere are also several courses in the surrounding communities and countryside.\n\n=== Swimming ===\nThree public swimming places exist throughout Newmarket: [[Ray Twinney Complex]], Gorman Pool, which is open only in the summer, and the Magna Centre.\n\n=== Curling ===\nNewmarket is home to the [[List of curling clubs in Ontario#Zone 7|York Curling Club]].\n\n== Media ==\n=== Print ===\nLocal print media is provided by ''[[The Newmarket Era]]'' (formerly the ''Era Banner'').

There are nine bees, representing the town's nine most prominent businesses at the time that Newmarket was incorporated as a Village.<ref>{{cite web |title=Museum FAQ |url=https://www.newmarket.ca/ThingsToDo/Pages/Recreation%20and%20Culture/Elman%20W.%20Campbell%20Museum/Museum-FAQ.aspx |website=Town of Newmarket |accessdate=2 August 2019}}</ref> The latest form of the [[Seal (device)|seal]] was introduced in 1938 with the arms somewhat altered from&nbsp;\u2013 but very similar in concept to&nbsp;\u2013 one that was earlier used. The arms' origin is something of a mystery, however. It is unknown what artist created the current version&nbsp;\u2013 or indeed the earlier version&nbsp;\u2013 and the town has no official record as to the purchase or redesign of the arms.<ref>{{cite web |title=Town of Newmarket Emblem |url=http://www.newmarket.ca/userfiles/HTML/nts_1_477_1.html |publisher=Town of Newmarket |accessdate=13 November 2018 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20051123153539/http://www.newmarket.ca/userfiles/HTML/nts_1_477_1.html |archivedate=23 November 2005}}</ref>\n\n== Notable people ==\n<!-- -notability for this list is established by the existence of a Wikipedia article on the subject-- -->\n* [[Dorian Baxter]], politician, priest, Elvis impersonator\n* [[John Candy]], comedian/actor\n* [[Jim Carrey]], comedian/actor<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.jimcarreyonline.com/info/biography.html |title=Biography |publisher=Jim Carrey Online |accessdate=May 7, 2012 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120518223337/http://www.jimcarreyonline.com/info/biography.html |archivedate=May 18, 2012 }}</ref>\n* [[Munro Chambers]], actor\n* [[Frances Champagne]], professor, neuroscientist<ref>[https://www.classfinders.com/directory/on/newmarket/]</ref>{{better citation needed|date=August 2019}}\n*[[Florence Shirley Patterson Jones]], astronomer\n* [[H.R.

It is part of [[Greater Toronto Area|Greater Toronto]] in the [[Golden Horseshoe]] region of [[Southern Ontario]].\n\nThe town was formed as one of many farming communities in the area, but also developed an industrial centre on the [[Northern Railway of Canada]]'s mainline, which was built in 1853 through what would become the downtown area.<ref>{{cite web |last1=McChesney |first1=Peggy |title=A Brief History of the Town of Newmarket |url=https://www.newmarket.ca/ThingsToDo/Documents/History%20-%20Terry%20Carter%20Compilation.pdf#page=3 |website=Newmarket |publisher=Town of Newmarket |accessdate=23 August 2019}}</ref>It also became a thriving market town with the arrival of the [[Metropolitan Street Railway (Toronto)|Metropolitan Street Railway]] in 1899.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Wyatt |first1=David |title=Toronto and York Radial Interurban |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180713073546/http://home.cc.umanitoba.ca/~wyatt/alltime/toronto-suburbs-on.html |website=All-Time List of Canadian Transit Systems |accessdate=23 August 2019}}</ref> Over time, the town developed into a primarily residential area, and the expansion of [[Ontario Highway 400]] to the west and the construction of [[Ontario Highway 404]] to the east increasingly turned it into a [[bedroom town]] since the 1980s. The province's Official Plan, however, includes growth in the business services and knowledge industries, as well as in the administrative, manufacturing and retail sectors.\n\nSome of Newmarket's most noticeable landmarks are the [[Upper Canada Mall]], [[Southlake Regional Health Centre]], the Main Street [[Heritage Conservation District]], the Fairy Lake Conservation Area, as well as many other parks and recreation areas.\n\n== History ==\nNewmarket's location on the [[Holland River]] long ago made the area a natural route of travel between [[Lake Ontario]] and [[Lake Simcoe]]. A major [[portage]] route, the [[Toronto Carrying-Place Trail]] ran one of its two routes down the [[Holland River|Holland]], through the Newmarket area, and over the [[Oak Ridges Moraine]] to the [[Rouge River (Ontario)|Rouge River]] and into Lake Ontario. A more widely used route ran down the western branch of the [[Holland River]], over the moraine, and down the [[Humber River (Ontario)|Humber River]]. In 1793, [[John Graves Simcoe]] travelled the trail, northward along the main route to the west, and south to [[York, Upper Canada|York]] (now [[Toronto]]) along the lesser used eastern route though Newmarket. Selecting the eastern route as the better of the two, Simcoe started construction of [[Yonge Street]] along the former trail in late 1795, starting in York in [[Toronto Harbour|Toronto Bay]], and ending at the newly named St. Albans ([[Holland Landing]]), north of Newmarket.\n\n[[File:John Bogart House three quarter BW view.JPG|thumbnail|left|The John Bogart House on Leslie Street is the oldest residential structure in Newmarket and the oldest two-storey residential building north of Toronto. It was built in 1811 and still serves as a house.]]\n\n===Early settlement===\nSome of the United States Quakers were interested in moving northward, disturbed by the violence they were expected to take part in during the [[American Revolution]]. In June 1800, Timothy Rogers, a [[Quaker]] from [[Vermont]], explored the area around the Holland River to find a suitable location for a new Quaker settlement. He, Samuel Lundy and their group of Religious Society of Friends received the grant of a large amount of land. In 1801 Rogers returned along with several Quaker families who had left their homes in [[Vermont]] and [[Pennsylvania]]. They settled here in 1801-1803.<ref name=\"ontarioplaques.com\">{{cite web|url=http://www.ontarioplaques.com/Plaques/Plaque_York14.html|title=Founding of Newmarket Historical Plaque |website=www.ontarioplaques.com| accessdate=May 1, 2018|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nIn 1801, the Quaker families acquired {{convert|8000|acres|ha}} around the Holland River. Joseph Hill constructed a mill on the river,<ref name=\"ontarioplaques.com\"/> damming it to produce a [[mill pond]] that is now known as Fairy Lake.<ref name=\"newmarket.ca\">{{cite web |url=http://www.newmarket.ca/ThingsToDo/Documents/History%20-%20Terry%20Carter%20Compilation.pdf |title=A Brief History of the Town of Newmarket |accessdate=February 9, 2018 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160428155938/http://www.newmarket.ca/ThingsToDo/Documents/History%20-%20Terry%20Carter%20Compilation.pdf |archivedate=April 28, 2016 }}</ref> The settlement of \"Upper Yonge Street\" sprouted up around the mill, which explains why its primary downtown area was centred on the Holland River, and not on Yonge Street which is some distance to the west. Hill also built a [[Tanning (leather)|tannery]] just to the north of the mill, and the first general store and house, as well as additional mills.\n\nBy 1802, [[Elisha Beman]], who owned a great deal of land in the area, had begun to establish businesses.<ref name=\"ontarioplaques.com\"/> A mill was first and other businesses (including a [[distillery]]) soon followed. Mordecai Millar also built mills and Joseph Hill opened a tannery. During the [[War of 1812]] a resident, William Roe, was able to hide gold that was in the settlement's treasury, saving it from invading American troops. The war also helped bring some prosperity as the army purchased goods and food and hired locals to build structures.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Carter |first1=Robert Terence |title=Stories of Newmarket: An Old Ontario Town |publisher=Dundurn |page=76 |url=https://books.google.ca/books?id=IKwo5Fb7_YUC&printsec=frontcover&dq=Newmarket,+ontario+war+of+1812&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjI18aZt8fTAhVBw4MKHbG6DQ8Q6AEIIzAA#v=onepage&q=war%20of%201812&f=false |accessdate=13 November 2018}}</ref>\n\nBy 1814, the settlement had two frame and several log buildings used as residences.<ref name=\"electriccanadian.com\">{{cite web |url=http://www.electriccanadian.com/history/ontario/york/part03chap11.htm |title=History of Toronto and County of York in Ontario Part III: Town of Newmarket |accessdate=April 28, 2017 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170819060727/http://www.electriccanadian.com/history/ontario/york/part03chap11.htm |archivedate=August 19, 2017 }}</ref> The town continued to grow through the early 19th century, along with the formation of [[Aurora, Ontario|Aurora]] and [[Holland Landing, Ontario|Holland Landing]], and a market held in the current downtown location gave rise to the name \"Newmarket\".\n\nNewmarket played a central role in the [[Rebellions of 1837\u20131838]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://cfha.info/journal77p57.pdf |title=The War of 1812-14 and the Rebellion of 1837 from \u201cThe Story of Sharon\u201d |accessdate=April 28, 2017 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180501154110/http://cfha.info/journal77p57.pdf |archivedate=May 1, 2018 }}</ref><ref>{{cite book |title=The Rebellion of 1837 in Upper Canada : a collection of documents |year=1985 |publisher=Champlain Society in cooperation with the Ontario Heritage Foundation |isbn=0-88629-026-0 |pages=[https://archive.org/details/rebellionof1837i0000unse/page/182 182]\u2013186 |edition=Second Printing |url=https://archive.org/details/rebellionof1837i0000unse |url-access=registration |quote=Newmarket . |accessdate=13 November 2018}}</ref> The town was a focal point of discontent against the manipulations of the governing Family Compact, of whom it was said \"were robbing the country\". Rebel leader [[William Lyon Mackenzie]] organized a series of meetings leading to the Rebellion. During the first of these meetings, on August 3, 1837, Mackenzie delivered his first campaign speech from the veranda of the North American Hotel at the corner of Botsford and Main Streets. This speech is largely credited for being the spark to the rebellion as it was heard by about 600 farmers and others sympathetic to Mackenzie\u2019s cause, who later that year armed themselves and marched down Yonge St. to take the capital. A number of leaders from this area were [[Attainder|attainted]] for [[high treason]], convicted and [[Hanging|hanged]].<ref>{{cite book |title=History of Toronto and County of York, Ontario |year=1885 |publisher=C.

Much of the settlement was built on the south side of the village. Many farms surrounded the village. There were six churches or chapels, a post office, five stores, three taverns and tradesmen of various types.

By the 1950s, Newmarket was experiencing a suburban building boom due to its proximity to Toronto. The population increased from 5,000 to 11,000 between 1950 and 1970.\n\nThe [[Regional Municipality of York]] was formed in 1971, increasing the size of Newmarket with land from the Township of East Gwillimbury, from the Township of King and from the Township of Whitchurch. \n<ref name=\"newmarket.ca\"/> The construction of [[Upper Canada Mall]] at the corner of Yonge Street and Davis Drive in 1974 started pulling the focal point of the town westward from the historic Downtown area along Main Street.\n\nBy the early 1980s, the historic Downtown area suffered as most businesses had built up in the area around Upper Canada Mall, with additional [[strip mall]]s developing directly across the Yonge Street/Davis Drive intersection to the south and southeast. A concerted effort to revitalize the historic Downtown area during the late 1980s was successful. More recently, a $2.3-million investment was made by the town in 2004 in streetscaping and infrastructure improvements to roads and sidewalks in the historic Downtown. The historic area of Downtown's Main Street is once again a major focal point of the town.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.thespec.com/news-story/6953845-newmarket-main-street-wins-great-places-in-canada-award/|title=Newmarket Main Street wins Great Places in Canada award|first=Chris|last=Simon|date=November 8, 2016|accessdate=May 1, 2018|via=www.thespec.com|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180501154111/https://www.thespec.com/news-story/6953845-newmarket-main-street-wins-great-places-in-canada-award/|archivedate=May 1, 2018}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.thestar.com/life/2015/09/21/story-pod-the-latest-addition-to-newmarkets-revitalized-downtown.html|title=Story Pod the latest addition to Newmarket\u2019s revitalized downtown - The Star|website=thestar.com|accessdate=May 1, 2018|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160124205046/http://www.thestar.com/life/2015/09/21/story-pod-the-latest-addition-to-newmarkets-revitalized-downtown.html|archivedate=January 24, 2016}}</ref>\n\nThe arrival of [[Ontario Highway 404|Highway 404]] reversed the westward movement, pulling development eastward again, and surrounding the formerly separate hamlet of [[Bogarttown, Ontario|Bogarttown]] at the intersection of Mulock Drive and Leslie Street.<ref name=\"Carter\">{{cite book|title=Stories of Newmarket: An Old Ontario Town|last=Carter|first=Robert Terence|publisher=[[Dundurn Press]]|year=2011|isbn=9781554888801\n}}</ref><!-- page 50 --> Since then, Newmarket has grown considerably, filling out in all directions. The town limits now run from [[Bathurst Street (Toronto)|Bathurst Street]] in the west to Highway 404 in the east, and from just south of Green Lane to just north of St. John's Sideroad, taking over the former hamlet of Armitage at Yonge Street south of Mulock Drive. The southern boundary of the town is contiguous with [[Aurora, Ontario|Aurora]] to the south.\n\nArmitage was the first settlement of [[King, Ontario|King]] township, named in honour of its first settler Amos Armitage.<ref name=\"Carter\" /><!-- page 50 --> He had been recruited by Timothy Rogers, a [[Loyalist (American Revolution)|Loyalist]] from [[Vermont]], who in 1801 had travelled along [[Yonge Street]] and found the area appealing, and so applied for and received a grant for land totalling 40 farms, each of {{convert|200|acre|km2|1}}.\n\nOther defunct communities once located within the modern boundaries of Newmarket include Garbut's Hill, Paddytown, Petchville, Pleasantville, and White Rose.<ref name=\"Carter\" /><!-- page 51-52 -->\n\n== Geography ==\nNewmarket's geographical coordinates are 44.05\u00b0N, 79.46\u00b0W, and its elevation above [[sea level]] is 252&nbsp;m.<ref>{{cite web |title=Newmarket, Canada Page |url=http://www.fallingrain.com/world/CA/08/Newmarket.html |publisher=Falling Rain Software, Ltd. |accessdate=13 November 2018}}</ref> It has an area of 38.33&nbsp;km\u00b2. The town is bounded on the south by [[Aurora, Ontario|Aurora]], on the west by [[King, Ontario|King]], on the north by [[East Gwillimbury]] and on the east by [[Whitchurch\u2013Stouffville]].\n\nThe main river in Newmarket is the [[East Holland River]] (known locally simply as \"The [[Holland River]]\"), and all other streams in the town are tributaries thereto. These include Bogart Creek, a brook that weaves its way into the town from the [[Oak Ridges Moraine]] by way of [[Bogarttown, Ontario|Bogarttown]], emptying into the Holland River in north-central Newmarket; Western creek, another brook rising just west of the town, and reaching the Holland River in the town's north end; Tannery Creek, a stream that joins the Holland River in south Newmarket after flowing through [[Aurora, Ontario|Aurora]]; and a number of other small watercourses.\n\nThere are two [[reservoir]]s in Newmarket; Fairy Lake (which is managed by the [[Lake Simcoe Region Conservation Authority]]), a favourite recreational area in the centre of town, is a former [[mill pond]] on the East Holland River; and Bogart Pond, also a former mill pond, is fed and drained by Bogart Creek in Bogarttown. Furthermore, the water level in the reach of the East Holland north of Davis Drive is controlled from an unfinished [[Newmarket Canal]] lock, now used as a [[weir]].\n\nNewmarket also lies south of and above the [[Glacial Lake Algonquin|Algonquin Shoreline]], where elevations suddenly drop off from the gently rolling hills that characterize much of Newmarket to the much flatter, lower land down below in the [[Holland Marsh]].\n\nThe land is characterized mainly by [[till|glacial deposits]] from the last [[ice age]], known as \"Newmarket Till\". The town is underlain mainly by sand and gravel, ground by the [[Ice sheet|icesheets]] that covered the area until about 10,000 years ago. No [[outcrop]]s are to be found anywhere in Newmarket, so deep are the glacial deposits.\n\n== Climate ==\nNewmarket has a [[humid continental climate]] ([[Humid continental climate#Koppen Dfb|K\u00f6ppen climate classification ''Dfb'']]), with four distinct seasons featuring cold, somewhat snowy winters and warm, humid summers. Precipitation is moderate and consistent in all seasons, although summers are a bit wetter than winter due to the moisture from the Gulf of Mexico and the Great Lakes.\n\n{{Weather box\n| collapsed    = yes\n| metric first = yes\n| single line  = yes\n| location     = Newmarket/King Smoke Tree &ndash; 1981&ndash;2010{{efn|Dates may vary.

She described her early initiation into psychiatry: \"Mr. Maurycy Bornsztajn was a [[psychoanalyst]] who worked, at the beginning of the war, in our Warsaw apartment. I lay near the door and eavesdropped on his conversations with patients. These were fascinating lessons in psychiatry.\"\n\nDuring [[World War II]] she participated in the [[Warsaw Uprising]] and afterward was transported to work in the Wiener Holtzwerke factory. She wrote in her diary: \"I remember a powerful, overwhelming nostalgia for Warsaw. In my dreams I walked down [[Marszalkowska Street]] toward ''[[Plac Zbawiciela]]'' (Savior Square), it would rain, and I would wake all in tears. This dream recurred often.\"\n\n[[Image:Jflatau eflatau1.png|thumb|200px|left|Joanna Flatau with her father, probably in [[Konstancin-Jeziorna|Konstancin]] ca. 1932]]\nFrom 1946 to 1952 she studied at [[Warsaw Medical School]], graduating on December 22, 1952. Her friend, surgeon Maciek Grochowicz, has said:  \"Several years after the terrible destruction of the Second World War, I met Joanna and I knew about her sufferings, life-threatening situations, and work in the forced labor factory during the War, but wonderful, optimistic part of her character enabled her to become reborn, open to the future, and full of happiness and enjoyment of life. My recollections of our college times are not only related to exams and our successes. Everybody in that time who came into contact with Joanna remembered a beautiful, elegant, and compassionate person, even during the difficult situations. Thanks to her, it was easier to overcome obstacles and develop a circle of close friends. She was an exceptional doctor. Her professional success was based on ability to combine experience and intuition with a very personal relationship with each of her patients. She had the rare ability to encompass a deep understanding of the patient\u2019s problems with friendship and a natural closeness.\"\n\nAfter graduation, she worked in the Psychiatry Department at the Warsaw Medical University and subsequently established Student Psychiatry Clinic for students and academics in Warsaw. She was the director of this clinic for 38 years, working there for the rest of her life.\n\nFor many years she organized summer camps for students with nervous disorders, the first one took place in Duszniki in 1970. The therapy was based on, just beginning at that time in Poland, individual and [[group psychotherapy]]; one of the psychotherapists was [[Andrzej Samson]]. She introduced techniques innovative for that time in Poland -  [[choreotherapy]] which was organized by Zofia Aleszko, yoga which was organized by Tadeusz Pasek.  She established a sanatorium for students with nervous disorders in Warsaw,  origins of which she describes as: \"In May of 1963, I went to Clinique Dupre in Sceaux, close to Paris.

She described her early initiation into psychiatry: \"Mr. Maurycy Bornsztajn was a [[psychoanalyst]] who worked, at the beginning of the war, in our Warsaw apartment. I lay near the door and eavesdropped on his conversations with patients. These were fascinating lessons in psychiatry.\"\n\nDuring [[World War II]] she participated in the [[Warsaw Uprising]] and afterward was transported to work in the Wiener Holtzwerke factory. She wrote in her diary: \"I remember a powerful, overwhelming nostalgia for Warsaw. In my dreams I walked down [[Marszalkowska Street]] toward ''[[Plac Zbawiciela]]'' (Savior Square), it would rain, and I would wake all in tears. This dream recurred often.\"\n\n[[Image:Jflatau eflatau1.png|thumb|200px|left|Joanna Flatau with her father, probably in [[Konstancin-Jeziorna|Konstancin]] ca. 1932]]\nFrom 1946 to 1952 she studied at [[Warsaw Medical School]], graduating on December 22, 1952. Her friend, surgeon Maciek Grochowicz, has said:  \"Several years after the terrible destruction of the Second World War, I met Joanna and I knew about her sufferings, life-threatening situations, and work in the forced labor factory during the War, but wonderful, optimistic part of her character enabled her to become reborn, open to the future, and full of happiness and enjoyment of life. My recollections of our college times are not only related to exams and our successes. Everybody in that time who came into contact with Joanna remembered a beautiful, elegant, and compassionate person, even during the difficult situations. Thanks to her, it was easier to overcome obstacles and develop a circle of close friends. She was an exceptional doctor. Her professional success was based on ability to combine experience and intuition with a very personal relationship with each of her patients. She had the rare ability to encompass a deep understanding of the patient\u2019s problems with friendship and a natural closeness.\"\n\nAfter graduation, she worked in the Psychiatry Department at the Warsaw Medical University and subsequently established Student Psychiatry Clinic for students and academics in Warsaw. She was the director of this clinic for 38 years, working there for the rest of her life.\n\nFor many years she organized summer camps for students with nervous disorders, the first one took place in Duszniki in 1970. The therapy was based on, just beginning at that time in Poland, individual and [[group psychotherapy]]; one of the psychotherapists was [[Andrzej Samson]]. She introduced techniques innovative for that time in Poland -  [[choreotherapy]] which was organized by Zofia Aleszko, yoga which was organized by Tadeusz Pasek.  She established a sanatorium for students with nervous disorders in Warsaw,  origins of which she describes as: \"In May of 1963, I went to Clinique Dupre in Sceaux, close to Paris. After a month of visiting, I came back obsessed with an idea of founding a sanatorium for students with psychiatric illnesses. In the late spring of 1969, the first 6 students snuck into Gornoslaska Street (previously a [[tuberculosis sanatorium]]). Later, there were 12, 22, and finally, it achieved the magic number of 44.\"\n\nHer grave is in the Ewangelicko-Augsburski Cemetery in Warsaw.\n\n== Notes and references ==\n<!--See http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Footnotes for an explanation of how to generate footnotes using the <ref> and </ref> tags and the tag below -->\n{{reflist|2}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Flatau, Joanna}}\n[[Category:1928 births]]\n[[Category:1999 deaths]]\n[[Category:People from Warsaw]]\n[[Category:Polish psychiatrists]]\n[[Category:20th-century Polish physicians]]\n[[Category:Polish women physicians]]\n[[Category:Polish women academics]]\n[[Category:Women psychiatrists]]\n[[Category:20th-century women physicians]]\n", "name_user": "Ser Amantio di Nicolao", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eNotes and references:add authority control", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joanna_Flatau"}
