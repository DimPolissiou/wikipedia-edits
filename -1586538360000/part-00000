The band remains active today with a different line-up: Sickie Wifebeater ([[Eric Carlson (musician)|Steve Carlson]]) on lead guitar, Dr Heathen Scum ([[Steve Broy]]) on bass guitar, Cousin Fister (Bryan) on rhythm guitar, and John Christopher on drums.\n\n==History==\nFounding members Hoke, Eric Carlson (guitar) and Steve Broy (bass) attended Roosevelt High School together in Seattle,<ref name=allmusic /> and began experimenting together with crude [[punk rock|punk]] and primitive heavy metal. Upon formation, The Mentors began to tour the Northwest, playing shows with their trademark executioner hoods (it was the idea of El Duce, who adored a horror movie called \"Mark of the Devil\") and bawdy lyrics. Broy was in and out of the band during its early career due to his preoccupation with pursuing a degree in engineering.<ref name=face>{{cite web|author= |url=http://www.facebook.com/pages/The-Mentors/80684623655?v=info |title=The Mentors |publisher=Facebook |date=2009-04-27 |accessdate=2013-07-23}}</ref> Other bassists from this era include Jeff Dahl, Chris Jacobsen (Jack Shit), and Mike Dewey (Heathen Scum Wezda).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.metal-archives.com/band.php?id=15788 |title=The Mentors - Encyclopaedia Metallum |publisher=The Metal Archives |date= |accessdate=2013-07-23}}</ref>\nHoke claimed in a 1982 interview with Metalgasm Magazine that many of the perverse acts described in Mentor songs came from a six-week relationship he had with Lisa Boucher.\n\nThrough Mystic Records, the Mentors released their first EP, ''The Trash Bag'', in 1983.<ref name=bio /> Their first live album, ''Live at the Whiskey/Cathey de Grande'', came out the following year; both records were produced by Phillip (Philco) Raves. In 1985, they signed to Death Records, a subsidiary of [[Metal Blade Records|Metal Blade]], and released their debut studio LP, ''[[You Axed for It!]]'', with Broy returning on the bass.<ref name=face /> During this time, Hoke maintained a strong public presence, making a controversial appearance<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wzxOsXCUE3A |title=YouTube |publisher=YouTube |date= |accessdate=2013-07-23}}</ref> alongside fellow metal band [[GWAR]] on ''[[The Jerry Springer Show]]'', where Hoke's band, beliefs, and public image were criticized.<ref name=allmusic />\n\nThe Mentors did not achieve true notoriety until the 1985 Congressional hearings orchestrated by Tipper Gore\u2019s [[Parents Music Resource Center]] (PMRC). The relatively obscure Mentors caught the attention of the PMRC with their song, \"Golden Showers\", prompting a reading of some of its lyrics on the Congressional floor and inducing peals of uncontrolled laughter from those present.{{Citation needed|reason=Enjoyed reading this and I'm pretty sure it would've happened but it doesn't read correctly without a citation.|date=March 2018}}\n\nBroy was briefly replaced by bassists Wayne Daddio (\"Ripper\"), Ed Danky (\"Poppa Sneaky Spermshooter\"), and Zippy, but later returned to the group. In 1989, The Mentors released their third album, ''[[Sex, Drugs & Rock 'n' Roll]]'', a faux-live{{Citation needed|date=April 2010}} record. This album caught the attention of the hard rock band [[Revolting Cocks]], who invited The Mentors on tour with them.<ref name=allmusic />\n\nThey released ''[[Rock Bible]]'' in 1990, with Rick Lomas (\"Insect On Acid\")<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.rockdetector.com/artist/usa/seattle/mentors |title=MusicMight :: Artists :: MENTORS |publisher=Rockdetector.com |accessdate=2013-07-23 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140318213900/http://www.rockdetector.com/artist/usa/seattle/mentors |archivedate=2014-03-18 }}</ref> sitting in on drums. ''[[To the Max (The Mentors album)|To the Max]]'' followed the next year. Clark \"Moosedick\" Savage<ref name=bio /> often filled in for Hoke on drums at live shows, as Hoke's alcoholism had made it difficult for him to play drums and sing simultaneously.\n\nThe Mentors remained sporadically active thereafter. Hoke began a solo career, while Carlson formed the band Jesters of Destiny.<ref name=face /> In 1997, while being interviewed for the [[documentary film]] ''[[Kurt and Courtney]]'', Hoke claimed that [[Courtney Love]] had offered him $50,000 to kill her husband [[Kurt Cobain]],<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.justiceforkurt.com/investigation/documents/hoke_interview.shtml |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060325093211/http://www.justiceforkurt.com/investigation/documents/hoke_interview.shtml |url-status=dead |archive-date=2006-03-25 |title=Justice For Kurt Cobain - Investigation - Case Documents - Eldon Hoke Interview |publisher=Justiceforkurt.com |date=2007-10-26 |accessdate=2013-07-23 }}</ref> whose death was ruled a suicide.

In 2006 Singer and drummer Marc DeLeon (\"Mad Dog\"), of the Mentors tribute band The Mantors, replaced El Rapo and, later, Savage. 2009 saw the release of ''[[Ducefixion]]'', their eighth full-length record. DeLeon left the Mentors in 2014 during the making of full length documentary film called [[The Mentors: Kings of Sleaze Rockumentary]], directed by April Jones. \n\nOn May 25, 2017, the Mentors released ''[[The Illuminaughty]]'', their first studio album in eight years, with Broy and Lomas sharing the vocal duties.\n\n==Members==\n{{col-begin}}\n{{col-2}}\n;Current members\n*[[Eric Carlson
