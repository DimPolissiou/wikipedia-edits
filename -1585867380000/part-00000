The work was an attack on the shipping industry's exploitation of seafarers. From 1936 to 1937, Grieg published the magazine ''Veien Frem'', which initially succeeded in attracting prominent writers, but as the magazine adopted an increasingly Stalinist position relating to the Moscow Trials, most of them severed ties with it and it ceased publication.<ref name=\"Liukkonen\" />\n[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 183-17036-0005, Spanischer B\u00fcrgerkrieg, Nordahl Grieg, Ludwig Renn.jpg|thumb|Grieg as a war correspondent in Spain in 1937, with [[Gerda Grepp]] and [[Ludwig Renn]]]]\nHis 1937 dramatic play ''Nederlaget''  was about the [[Paris Commune]].

In 1939, the Soviet Union signed the [[Molotov\u2013Ribbentrop Pact]] with Nazi Germany and, until the [[Operation Barbarossa|1941 Nazi invasion]], instructed Communists worldwide to regard the ongoing war as an \"Imperialist\" war in which they should not take part. Grieg was a staunch anti-Nazi and Norwegian patriot and committed himself in 1940 to the struggle against the Nazi occupation. In the winter of 1939-40, Grieg served in the [[Norwegian Army]] in [[Finnmark]] on neutrality guard during the Russo-Finnish [[Winter War]]. In 1940, after serving during the [[Norwegian Campaign]] against German forces, he escaped to the [[United Kingdom]] aboard the same vessel that carried the Norwegian Royal family and the [[Flight of the Norwegian National Treasury|National Gold reserves]].<ref name=vf/><ref>[http://www.dagbladet.no/forfatter/nordahl_grieg.html ''Nordahl Grieg'' (Dagbladet Forfatter)] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110322043638/http://www.dagbladet.no/forfatter/nordahl_grieg.html |date=22 March 2011 }}</ref>\n\n=== War correspondent ===\nOnce in Britain, Grieg served the [[Norwegian government in exile]], and participated in making patriotic radio programs.<ref name=\"Liukkonen\" /> He was commissioned in the [[Norwegian Armed Forces]] and served as a war correspondent.

The work was an attack on the shipping industry's exploitation of seafarers. From 1936 to 1937, Grieg published the magazine ''Veien Frem'', which initially succeeded in attracting prominent writers, but as the magazine adopted an increasingly Stalinist position relating to the Moscow Trials, most of them severed ties with it and it ceased publication.<ref name=\"Liukkonen\" />\n[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 183-17036-0005, Spanischer B\u00fcrgerkrieg, Nordahl Grieg, Ludwig Renn.jpg|thumb|Grieg as a war correspondent in Spain in 1937, with [[Gerda Grepp]] and [[Ludwig Renn]]]]\nHis 1937 dramatic play ''Nederlaget''  was about the [[Paris Commune]].

In 1939, the Soviet Union signed the [[Molotov\u2013Ribbentrop Pact]] with Nazi Germany and, until the [[Operation Barbarossa|1941 Nazi invasion]], instructed Communists worldwide to regard the ongoing war as an \"Imperialist\" war in which they should not take part. Grieg was a staunch anti-Nazi and Norwegian patriot and committed himself in 1940 to the struggle against the Nazi occupation. In the winter of 1939-40, Grieg served in the [[Norwegian Army]] in [[Finnmark]] on neutrality guard during the Russo-Finnish [[Winter War]]. In 1940, after serving during the [[Norwegian Campaign]] against German forces, he escaped to the [[United Kingdom]] aboard the same vessel that carried the Norwegian Royal family and the [[Flight of the Norwegian National Treasury|National Gold reserves]].<ref name=vf/><ref>[http://www.dagbladet.no/forfatter/nordahl_grieg.html ''Nordahl Grieg'' (Dagbladet Forfatter)] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110322043638/http://www.dagbladet.no/forfatter/nordahl_grieg.html |date=22 March 2011 }}</ref>\n\n=== War correspondent ===\nOnce in Britain, Grieg served the [[Norwegian government in exile]], and participated in making patriotic radio programs.<ref name=\"Liukkonen\" /> He was commissioned in the [[Norwegian Armed Forces]] and served as a war correspondent.

He was attached to [[No. 460 Squadron RAAF|460 Squadron]], [[Royal Australian Air Force]] (RAAF), which was based at [[RAF Binbrook]]. Grieg joined the crew of a [[Avro Lancaster|Lancaster]] Mk.III (serial number ''LM316'', squadron code \"AR-H2\") captained by [[Flying Officer]] A. R. Mitchell, RAAF. Berlin was well-defended.

The two met when Grieg turned up unannounced at Greene's cottage at [[Chipping Campden]]  in 1931.\n\nIn 1945, a collection of his war poems, ''Friheten'' was published and remained a  best-selling Norwegian poetry collection.\n\nIn 1957, a statue of Grieg by Roar Bjorg  (1912-1984) was unveiled at [[Den Nationale Scene]] in Bergen.\n\nIn 1990, the musical ''Nordahl Grieg i v\u00e5re hjerter'' written by Erling Gjelsvik with music by Knut Skodvin, debuted in Bergen.<ref>Erling T.

ROK Special Forces brigades work in close relationship with their [[United States Army Special Forces]] counterparts. ROK Special Forces brigades were modelled after the U.S. Army Green Berets.\n\nU.S. SOF in Korea are under the command and control of [[Special Operations Command Korea]] (SOCKOR) which is a sub-unified command assigned under the Combatant Command (COCOM) of United States Special Operations Command (USSOCOM) and further delegated to the Operational Command of the [[United States Forces Korea|USFK]].\n\nSince 1993, the South Korean military has trained experts by sending officers to various PKO training institutions such as the Northern Europe United Nations Training Corps (UNTC), [[Poland]], and [[Ireland]]. And since 1995, officers and related government officials have been sent to the Pearson Peacekeeping Center (PPC) in [[Canada]]. To lay the foundation for PKO education domestically, in 1995 the military designated the Joint Services Staff College to be the lead institution to educate officers to become military observers and staff. In May 1998, the PKO Department was officially inaugurated within the college. Moreover, the Special Warfare Command's Education Corps was designated as the institution solely responsible for unit-level education of PKO forces by providing solid education for infantry and engineer personnel.\n\n==Organization==\n{{seealso|Special Forces Brigades of the Republic of Korea}}\n[[File:DF-ST-82-00588 Korean paratroopers prepare to jump from a C-130 Hercules aircraft during exercise Purple Duck.jpeg|thumb|Korean paratroopers prepare to jump from a C-130 (1980).]]\nThe command includes six [[Special Forces Brigades of the Republic of Korea|special forces brigades]] and one overseas deployment group.

This was seen as part of South Korea's continued development of their own preemptive strike protocol.<ref name=\"auto\"/>\n\nThe 13th Brigade was selected to be reorganized and rearmed as a \"decapitation unit\", numbering around 1,000 soldiers. The launch of the special brigade was originally scheduled for 2019, but the advancement of the nuclear and missile capabilities of the North has progressed faster than expected. On Dec. 1, 2017, the unit was created as planned. The existing 13th Special Forces Brigade was reorganized into a Special Mission Brigade and held its founding ceremony. The new unit will be equipped with special weapons capable of underwater and ground combat operations, a special rifle for grenade launchers and other means of transport suitable for air, sea and underwater infiltration such as special operations transport aircraft. It was reported that the elite [[United States Naval Special Warfare Command|U.S. naval special missions]] unit DEVGRU, also known as [[SEAL Team Six]], will provide training and have an advisory role to help the brigade prepare for its assassination missions.\n\n== Selection and training ==\nThe special forces operators within the Republic of Korea Special Warfare Command serve longer than the usual military conscripts within the [[Republic of Korea Army|ROKA]]. The service term lasts 4 years and 3 months in comparison with the usual 1 year and 9 months for a typical conscript in the regular army. This includes the 3 months of training that all recruits must undergo before becoming attached to a specific brigade. Those who wish to remain in service for longer than the set term may do so. \n[[File:Republic of Korea special forces.jpg|thumb|233px|Special forces operators training in the snow]]\n[[File:2013.1.9 \ud2b9\uc804\uc0ac \uc124\ud55c\uc9c0\uadf9\ubcf5\ud6c8\ub828 Rep.of Korea Army Special Warfare Force (8378459651).jpg|thumb|232px|SWC operators using skis to train in the snow]]\nDuring the first month of training, recruits will have to undergo a strenuous physical test to ensure they are physically capable of fulfilling their role. This will include 25km runs across mountainous terrain with a 30kg load out under timed conditions as well as daily fitness regimes to weed out physically incapable recruits. Firearms training and weapons handling training will naturally be integrated throughout the 3-month training period. Due to the nature of the Korean warfare tactics, operators will be taught two main methods of infiltration into North Korea: aerial infiltration and naval infiltration which includes, for example, [[High-altitude military parachuting|High Altitude Low Opening]] (HALO) training and [[Scuba diving|SCUBA]] training. The aim of this part of the training is to make the operators as versatile as possible to ensure that they can tackle the difficult Korean terrain. On the ground they will undergo [[mountaineering]] training as well as [[Survival skills|survival training]] which involves them surviving without communications and limited supplies for up to a week. [[Resistance to interrogation]] training is also employed by the organization. This has led to several deaths such as one recruit dying from suffocation while being put in a typical [[stress position]] for several hours during captivity training.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-29041642|title=Two South Korean soldiers die in training drill|date=2014-09-03|newspaper=BBC News|language=en-GB|access-date=2017-02-01}}</ref> Moreover, sub-zero training is enforced during the winter which involves recruits being fully submerged in ice-cold water and carrying out physical training drills in the snow without their tops.\n\nHand-to-hand combat, consisting of Teukgong Moosool and [[Krav maga]], is strongly emphasized within the ROK SWC but is taught after the 3-month training period once the operators have been attached to a particular brigade.\n\n==Evergreen unit==\nThe Evergreen Unit ({{lang-ko|\uc0c1\ub85d\uc218\ubd80\ub300}}) is an ad hoc, all-volunteer, amalgamated ROK Army unit (usually of battalion strength), composed of various members of the South Korean military (including infantry, combat support elements such as engineers and medics, ROK Special Forces and the ROK Marine Corps.), trained specifically for conducting worldwide security operations and rendering humanitarian assistance during ad hoc overseas deployments and UN [[Peacekeeping Operations]].\n\n===Somalia===\nThe South Korean military participated in UN-led [[Peacekeeping Operations]] for the first time ever when it activated and deployed the \"Evergreen\" unit in the summer of 1993 to Somalia for the purpose of overseas reconstruction and humanitarian work. The ''Evergreen'' unit is an amalgamated [[ROK Army]] battalion-sized engineering unit (named after Korea's ubiquitous perennial conifers), activated for the first time on June 30, 1993 specifically for the Somali [[Peacekeeping|PKO]] deployment. The battalion-sized element, consisting of 504 men (rotated annually), participated in repairing roads and rendering humanitarian assistance during the crisis in Somalia at the time. By the time their mission ended in September 1994, the Evergreen unit deployed some 2,700 men and 1,300 pieces of equipment, successfully linking Balad and Zohar via a rebuilt road, and effectively cooperating with U.S. forces in building another road from Balad to Afgoa.\n\n===East Timor===\n[[File:2015.6.3 \uc721\uad70 \ud2b9\uc218\uc804\uc0ac\ub839\ubd80 \uc0b0\uc545\uadf9\ubcf5\ud6c8\ub828 Mountain Field Exercise, Republic of Korea Army Special Warfare Command (19099333885).jpg|thumb|297x297px|SWC operator during mountaineering drills]]\nOn August 30, 1999, a UN-mandated referendum for independence in [[East Timor]] was held, in which 78.5 percent of the electorate opted for independence. However, indigenous militias who opposed East Timor's independence caused devastating violence. Accordingly, the UN Security Council adopted a resolution to grant installation of the International Forces in East Timor ([[INTERFET]]), and the UN Secretary General together with the government of [[Australia]] officially requested the South Korean government's participation, in addition to other UN-member nations such as [[Indonesia]], who agreed to the deployment of the multinational forces and actively requested the participation of Asian nations.\nIn response to the international request to maintain security and restore order, the South Korean government authorized the formation of a second Evergreen Unit. With a battalion strength of 419 personnel\u2014201 from ROK Special Forces with the balance of personnel from transportation, supply, communications, and medical specialties\u2014the Evergreen unit arrived in Lautem, East Timor on 1 October 1999. Upon their arrival, the area was still reeling from post-election violence and 40 per cent of the island's built-up infrastructure\u2014including markets, schools and housing\u2014had been destroyed by rioters. The population of 50,000 had dropped to 20,000 as a result of refugee movement in response to the widespread violence. Shortly thereafter, the 2nd Evergreen Unit formally initiated operations on 22 October 1999 in Lospalos, East Timor. Using its security component, detached from the 5th Special Forces brigade, Special Warfare Command, the Evergreen's area of responsibility covered just 12% of East Timor's land mass.\n\nAfter a six-month deployment that ended on 28 April 2000, the original 419 members of the Korean battalion returned to Korea after conducting a two-week-long, in-theater handover and orientation for their replacements. In February 2002, the battalion was redeployed to the Oeucci enclave to continue peacekeeping operations. In April, 2003, an additional 250-strong element from the 8th ROK BATT, deployed for a six-month peacekeeping mission in Oecussi, East Timor. In addition to security operations, the unit engaged in public relations and election-related work, including voter registration, and humanitarian assistance.\n\n==Relationship with SOCKOR==\n[[File:Hires 150206-D-PM387-008A.jpg|205x205px|thumb|US military personnel visiting Special Warfare Command.]]\n\nThe members of the ROK Special Forces Brigades train and work in close partnership with members of the United States Special Operations Forces in defense of the Republic of Korea.

And since 1995, officers and related government officials have been sent to the Pearson Peacekeeping Center (PPC) in [[Canada]]. To lay the foundation for PKO education domestically, in 1995 the military designated the Joint Services Staff College to be the lead institution to educate officers to become military observers and staff. In May 1998, the PKO Department was officially inaugurated within the college. Moreover, the Special Warfare Command's Education Corps was designated as the institution solely responsible for unit-level education of PKO forces by providing solid education for infantry and engineer personnel.\n\n==Organization==\n{{seealso|Special Forces Brigades of the Republic of Korea}}\n[[File:DF-ST-82-00588 Korean paratroopers prepare to jump from a C-130 Hercules aircraft during exercise Purple Duck.jpeg|thumb|Korean paratroopers prepare to jump from a C-130 (1980).]]\nThe command includes six [[Special Forces Brigades of the Republic of Korea|special forces brigades]] and one overseas deployment group.

The launch of the special brigade was originally scheduled for 2019, but the advancement of the nuclear and missile capabilities of the North has progressed faster than expected. On Dec. 1, 2017, the unit was created as planned. The existing 13th Special Forces Brigade was reorganized into a Special Mission Brigade and held its founding ceremony. The new unit will be equipped with special weapons capable of underwater and ground combat operations, a special rifle for grenade launchers and other means of transport suitable for air, sea and underwater infiltration such as special operations transport aircraft. It was reported that the elite [[United States Naval Special Warfare Command|U.S. naval special missions]] unit DEVGRU, also known as [[SEAL Team Six]], will provide training and have an advisory role to help the brigade prepare for its assassination missions.\n\n== Selection and training ==\nThe special forces operators within the Republic of Korea Special Warfare Command serve longer than the usual military conscripts within the [[Republic of Korea Army|ROKA]]. The service term lasts 4 years and 3 months in comparison with the usual 1 year and 9 months for a typical conscript in the regular army. This includes the 3 months of training that all recruits must undergo before becoming attached to a specific brigade. Those who wish to remain in service for longer than the set term may do so. \n[[File:Republic of Korea special forces.jpg|thumb|233px|Special forces operators training in the snow]]\n[[File:2013.1.9 \ud2b9\uc804\uc0ac \uc124\ud55c\uc9c0\uadf9\ubcf5\ud6c8\ub828 Rep.of Korea Army Special Warfare Force (8378459651).jpg|thumb|232px|SWC operators using skis to train in the snow]]\nDuring the first month of training, recruits will have to undergo a strenuous physical test to ensure they are physically capable of fulfilling their role. This will include 25km runs across mountainous terrain with a 30kg load out under timed conditions as well as daily fitness regimes to weed out physically incapable recruits. Firearms training and weapons handling training will naturally be integrated throughout the 3-month training period. Due to the nature of the Korean warfare tactics, operators will be taught two main methods of infiltration into North Korea: aerial infiltration and naval infiltration which includes, for example, [[High-altitude military parachuting|High Altitude Low Opening]] (HALO) training and [[Scuba diving|SCUBA]] training. The aim of this part of the training is to make the operators as versatile as possible to ensure that they can tackle the difficult Korean terrain. On the ground they will undergo [[mountaineering]] training as well as [[Survival skills|survival training]] which involves them surviving without communications and limited supplies for up to a week. [[Resistance to interrogation]] training is also employed by the organization. This has led to several deaths such as one recruit dying from suffocation while being put in a typical [[stress position]] for several hours during captivity training.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-29041642|title=Two South Korean soldiers die in training drill|date=2014-09-03|newspaper=BBC News|language=en-GB|access-date=2017-02-01}}</ref> Moreover, sub-zero training is enforced during the winter which involves recruits being fully submerged in ice-cold water and carrying out physical training drills in the snow without their tops.\n\nHand-to-hand combat, consisting of Teukgong Moosool and [[Krav maga]], is strongly emphasized within the ROK SWC but is taught after the 3-month training period once the operators have been attached to a particular brigade.\n\n==Evergreen unit==\nThe Evergreen Unit ({{lang-ko|\uc0c1\ub85d\uc218\ubd80\ub300}}) is an ad hoc, all-volunteer, amalgamated ROK Army unit (usually of battalion strength), composed of various members of the South Korean military (including infantry, combat support elements such as engineers and medics, ROK Special Forces and the ROK Marine Corps.), trained specifically for conducting worldwide security operations and rendering humanitarian assistance during ad hoc overseas deployments and UN [[Peacekeeping Operations]].\n\n===Somalia===\nThe South Korean military participated in UN-led [[Peacekeeping Operations]] for the first time ever when it activated and deployed the \"Evergreen\" unit in the summer of 1993 to Somalia for the purpose of overseas reconstruction and humanitarian work.

It is the fourth film to feature [[Daniel Craig]] as the fictional [[MI6]] agent [[Portrayal of James Bond in film|James Bond]], and the second film in the series directed by [[Sam Mendes]] following ''[[Skyfall]].'' It was written by [[John Logan (writer)|John Logan]], [[Neal Purvis and Robert Wade|Neal Purvis, Robert Wade]], and [[Jez Butterworth]]. It is the final ''James Bond'' film to be co-distributed by Columbia Pictures, as [[Universal Pictures]] will become the international distributor of its future films.\n\nThe story sees Bond pitted against the global criminal organisation [[SPECTRE|Spectre]] and their enigmatic leader [[Ernst Stavro Blofeld]] ([[Christoph Waltz]]), who plans to launch a national surveillance network to mastermind criminal activities across the globe. The film marks Spectre and Blofeld's first appearance in an Eon Productions film since 1971's ''[[Diamonds Are Forever (film)|Diamonds Are Forever]]'';{{refn|name=SPECTRE reboot|group=N|Within the series' continuity, the version of [[SPECTRE|Spectre]] that appeared in ''[[Diamonds Are Forever (film)|Diamonds Are Forever]]'' was written out of the timeline with the 2006 reboot of the franchise in ''[[Casino Royale (2006 film)|Casino Royale]]'', making its appearance in ''Spectre'' its first in the new timeline.}} a character resembling Blofeld had previously appeared in the 1981 film, ''[[For Your Eyes Only (film)|For Your Eyes Only]]'', but, because of the [[Thunderball (novel)#Writing and copyright|''Thunderball'' controversy]], he is not named, nor is his face shown. Several [[List of recurring characters in the James Bond film series|''James Bond'' characters]], including [[M (James Bond)|M]], [[Q (James Bond)|Q]] and [[Miss Moneypenny|Eve Moneypenny]], return, with new additions [[L\u00e9a Seydoux]] as Dr. Madeleine Swann, [[Dave Bautista]] as Mr. Hinx, [[Andrew Scott (actor)|Andrew Scott]] as Max Denbigh and [[Monica Bellucci]] as Lucia Sciarra.\n\n''Spectre'' was filmed from December 2014 to July 2015 in Austria, the United Kingdom, Italy, Morocco and Mexico. The action scenes prioritised practical effects and stunts, while employing computer-generated imagery made by five different companies. ''Spectre'' was estimated to have cost around $245 million&mdash;with some sources listing it as high as $300 million&mdash;making it the most expensive Bond film and [[List of most expensive films|one of the most expensive films ever made]].\n\n''Spectre'' was released on 26 October 2015 in the United Kingdom\u201450 years after the release of ''[[Thunderball (film)|Thunderball]]'', 30 after ''[[A View to a Kill]]'', and 20 after ''[[GoldenEye]]''\u2014on the night of the world premiere at the London [[Royal Albert Hall]].<ref>{{cite news | url=http://www.ikonlondonmagazine.com/spectre-world-premiere-at-the-royal-albert-hall-london/ | title= Ikon London Magazine Coverage from the world premiere of Spectre | publisher= Ikon London Magazine | date=27 October 2015 | accessdate= 3 March 2018}}</ref> It was followed by a worldwide release, including [[IMAX]] screenings. It was released in the United States on 6 November. ''Spectre'' received mixed reviews from critics who praised the film's action sequences, cinematography, acting and musical score, though some criticism was aimed at the excessive runtime, screenplay and pacing. The theme song \"[[Writing's on the Wall (Sam Smith song)|Writing's on the Wall]]\", performed and co-written by [[Sam Smith (singer)|Sam Smith]], won an [[Academy Award for Best Original Song|Academy Award]] and [[Golden Globe Award for Best Original Song|Golden Globe]] for Best Original Song. ''Spectre'' grossed over $880 million worldwide, making it the [[2015 in film|sixth-highest-grossing film of 2015]] and the second-largest [[Inflation|unadjusted]] total for the series after ''Skyfall''.\n\nThe next film in the series, ''[[No Time to Die]]'', is to be released in November 2020, with Craig reprising his role for the final time and [[Cary Joji Fukunaga]] directing.\n\n== Plot ==\n<!-- FILM PLOTS should be no more than 700 words, so please do not add to this summary unless you can keep the word count below that figure. -->\nA posthumous message from the previous [[M (James Bond)|M]] leads [[MI6]] agent James Bond to carry out an unauthorised mission in [[Mexico City]] on the [[Day of the Dead]], where he stops a terrorist bombing plot. Bond kills Marco Sciarra, the terrorist leader, and takes his ring, which is emblazoned with a stylised octopus.\n\nUpon his return to [[London]], Bond is suspended from field duty by [[Gareth Mallory]], the current M, who is engaged in a power struggle with Max Denbigh (whom Bond dubs \"C\"), the Director-General of the new, [[private intelligence agency|privately backed]] Joint Intelligence Service formed by a recent merger of [[MI5]] and MI6. C campaigns for Britain to join the global surveillance and intelligence initiative \"[[Five Eyes#Nine Eyes|Nine Eyes]]\", and uses his influence to close down the [[00 Agent|'00']] field agent section, which he believes is outdated.\n\nBond disobeys M's orders and travels to Rome to attend Sciarra's funeral. He saves and seduces Sciarra's widow, Lucia, who tells him Sciarra belonged to an organisation of businessmen with criminal and terrorist connections. Bond uses Sciarra's ring to infiltrate a meeting to select Sciarra's replacement, where he identifies the leader, Franz Oberhauser. After hearing Oberhauser give the order for the \"Pale King\" to be assassinated, Bond is pursued across the city by the organisation's assassin, Mr. Hinx. [[Miss Moneypenny|Eve Moneypenny]] informs Bond that the Pale King is [[Mr. White (James Bond)|Mr. White]], a former member of the organisation's subsidiary Quantum who had fallen afoul of Oberhauser. Bond asks her to investigate Oberhauser, who was presumed dead roughly twenty years earlier.\n\nBond locates White in [[Altaussee]], Austria, where he is dying of [[thallium poisoning]]. He tells Bond to find and protect his daughter, psychiatrist Dr. Madeleine Swann, who will take him to L'Am\u00e9ricain in order to locate Oberhauser; White then commits suicide. Bond confronts Swann and rescues her from Hinx and his forces. The pair meet [[Q (James Bond)|Q]], who links Oberhauser to Bond's previous missions, identifying [[Le Chiffre]], [[Dominic Greene (James Bond)|Dominic Greene]] and [[Raoul Silva]] as agents of the same organisation, which Swann identifies as [[SPECTRE|Spectre]].\n\nSwann takes Bond to L'Am\u00e9ricain, a hotel in [[Tangier]], and they discover that White left evidence directing them to Oberhauser's base at a crater in the [[Sahara]]. Taking a train to a remote station, Bond and Swann encounter Hinx, who gets ejected from the train in the ensuing fight, and are escorted to Oberhauser's base. Oberhauser reveals that Spectre has funded the Joint Intelligence Service while staging terrorist attacks around the world, creating a need for the Nine Eyes programme. In return, C will give Spectre unlimited access to intelligence gathered by Nine Eyes, allowing them to anticipate and counter-act investigations into their operations. Bond is tortured as Oberhauser discusses their shared history: after the younger Bond was orphaned, Oberhauser's father, Hannes, became his temporary guardian. Believing that Bond supplanted his role as son, Oberhauser killed his father, staged his own death, adopted the name [[Ernst Stavro Blofeld]] and went on to form Spectre and target Bond. Bond and Swann stun Blofeld by setting off an explosive wristwatch at his face, and the two escape to London to prevent Nine Eyes from going online.\n\nIn London, Bond and Swann meet M, [[Bill Tanner]], Q, and Moneypenny with the intention of arresting C. Swann and Bond are abducted separately by Spectre operatives, while the rest of the group proceed with the plan. After Q succeeds in preventing the Nine Eyes from going online, a struggle between M and C ends with C falling to his death. Bond is taken to the ruins of the old [[SIS Building|MI6 building]], scheduled for demolition after Silva's bombing.{{refn|group=N|As depicted in ''[[Skyfall]]''.}} Blofeld, still alive, but now scarred over his right eye, tells Bond that he must escape before explosives are detonated in three minutes' time, or die trying to save Swann. Bond finds Swann and they escape by boat as the building collapses. Bond shoots down Blofeld's helicopter, which crashes onto [[Westminster Bridge]]. As Blofeld crawls from the wreckage, Bond confronts him but rather than kill him, leaves him to be arrested by M, before leaving the bridge with Swann. \n\nThe next morning, Bond borrows the repaired [[Aston Martin DB5]] from Q and drives away with Swann.\n\n=== Vehicles featured ===\n*[[Aston Martin DB10]]\n\n* [[Jaguar C-X75]]\n* [[Aston Martin DB5]]\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Daniel Craig]] as [[James Bond filmography|James Bond]], agent 007.

It is the fourth film to feature [[Daniel Craig]] as the fictional [[MI6]] agent [[Portrayal of James Bond in film|James Bond]], and the second film in the series directed by [[Sam Mendes]] following ''[[Skyfall]].'' It was written by [[John Logan (writer)|John Logan]], [[Neal Purvis and Robert Wade|Neal Purvis, Robert Wade]], and [[Jez Butterworth]]. It is the final ''James Bond'' film to be co-distributed by Columbia Pictures, as [[Universal Pictures]] will become the international distributor of its future films.\n\nThe story sees Bond pitted against the global criminal organisation [[SPECTRE|Spectre]] and their enigmatic leader [[Ernst Stavro Blofeld]] ([[Christoph Waltz]]), who plans to launch a national surveillance network to mastermind criminal activities across the globe. The film marks Spectre and Blofeld's first appearance in an Eon Productions film since 1971's ''[[Diamonds Are Forever (film)|Diamonds Are Forever]]'';{{refn|name=SPECTRE reboot|group=N|Within the series' continuity, the version of [[SPECTRE|Spectre]] that appeared in ''[[Diamonds Are Forever (film)|Diamonds Are Forever]]'' was written out of the timeline with the 2006 reboot of the franchise in ''[[Casino Royale (2006 film)|Casino Royale]]'', making its appearance in ''Spectre'' its first in the new timeline.}} a character resembling Blofeld had previously appeared in the 1981 film, ''[[For Your Eyes Only (film)|For Your Eyes Only]]'', but, because of the [[Thunderball (novel)#Writing and copyright|''Thunderball'' controversy]], he is not named, nor is his face shown. Several [[List of recurring characters in the James Bond film series|''James Bond'' characters]], including [[M (James Bond)|M]], [[Q (James Bond)|Q]] and [[Miss Moneypenny|Eve Moneypenny]], return, with new additions [[L\u00e9a Seydoux]] as Dr. Madeleine Swann, [[Dave Bautista]] as Mr. Hinx, [[Andrew Scott (actor)|Andrew Scott]] as Max Denbigh and [[Monica Bellucci]] as Lucia Sciarra.\n\n''Spectre'' was filmed from December 2014 to July 2015 in Austria, the United Kingdom, Italy, Morocco and Mexico. The action scenes prioritised practical effects and stunts, while employing computer-generated imagery made by five different companies. ''Spectre'' was estimated to have cost around $245 million&mdash;with some sources listing it as high as $300 million&mdash;making it the most expensive Bond film and [[List of most expensive films|one of the most expensive films ever made]].\n\n''Spectre'' was released on 26 October 2015 in the United Kingdom\u201450 years after the release of ''[[Thunderball (film)|Thunderball]]'', 30 after ''[[A View to a Kill]]'', and 20 after ''[[GoldenEye]]''\u2014on the night of the world premiere at the London [[Royal Albert Hall]].<ref>{{cite news | url=http://www.ikonlondonmagazine.com/spectre-world-premiere-at-the-royal-albert-hall-london/ | title= Ikon London Magazine Coverage from the world premiere of Spectre | publisher= Ikon London Magazine | date=27 October 2015 | accessdate= 3 March 2018}}</ref> It was followed by a worldwide release, including [[IMAX]] screenings. It was released in the United States on 6 November. ''Spectre'' received mixed reviews from critics who praised the film's action sequences, cinematography, acting and musical score, though some criticism was aimed at the excessive runtime, screenplay and pacing. The theme song \"[[Writing's on the Wall (Sam Smith song)|Writing's on the Wall]]\", performed and co-written by [[Sam Smith (singer)|Sam Smith]], won an [[Academy Award for Best Original Song|Academy Award]] and [[Golden Globe Award for Best Original Song|Golden Globe]] for Best Original Song. ''Spectre'' grossed over $880 million worldwide, making it the [[2015 in film|sixth-highest-grossing film of 2015]] and the second-largest [[Inflation|unadjusted]] total for the series after ''Skyfall''.\n\nThe next film in the series, ''[[No Time to Die]]'', is to be released in November 2020, with Craig reprising his role for the final time and [[Cary Joji Fukunaga]] directing.\n\n== Plot ==\n<!-- FILM PLOTS should be no more than 700 words, so please do not add to this summary unless you can keep the word count below that figure. -->\nA posthumous message from the previous [[M (James Bond)|M]] leads [[MI6]] agent James Bond to carry out an unauthorised mission in [[Mexico City]] on the [[Day of the Dead]], where he stops a terrorist bombing plot. Bond kills Marco Sciarra, the terrorist leader, and takes his ring, which is emblazoned with a stylised octopus.\n\nUpon his return to [[London]], Bond is suspended from field duty by [[Gareth Mallory]], the current M, who is engaged in a power struggle with Max Denbigh (whom Bond dubs \"C\"), the Director-General of the new, [[private intelligence agency|privately backed]] Joint Intelligence Service formed by a recent merger of [[MI5]] and MI6. C campaigns for Britain to join the global surveillance and intelligence initiative \"[[Five Eyes#Nine Eyes|Nine Eyes]]\", and uses his influence to close down the [[00 Agent|'00']] field agent section, which he believes is outdated.\n\nBond disobeys M's orders and travels to Rome to attend Sciarra's funeral. He saves and seduces Sciarra's widow, Lucia, who tells him Sciarra belonged to an organisation of businessmen with criminal and terrorist connections. Bond uses Sciarra's ring to infiltrate a meeting to select Sciarra's replacement, where he identifies the leader, Franz Oberhauser. After hearing Oberhauser give the order for the \"Pale King\" to be assassinated, Bond is pursued across the city by the organisation's assassin, Mr. Hinx. [[Miss Moneypenny|Eve Moneypenny]] informs Bond that the Pale King is [[Mr. White (James Bond)|Mr. White]], a former member of the organisation's subsidiary Quantum who had fallen afoul of Oberhauser. Bond asks her to investigate Oberhauser, who was presumed dead roughly twenty years earlier.\n\nBond locates White in [[Altaussee]], Austria, where he is dying of [[thallium poisoning]]. He tells Bond to find and protect his daughter, psychiatrist Dr. Madeleine Swann, who will take him to L'Am\u00e9ricain in order to locate Oberhauser; White then commits suicide. Bond confronts Swann and rescues her from Hinx and his forces. The pair meet [[Q (James Bond)|Q]], who links Oberhauser to Bond's previous missions, identifying [[Le Chiffre]], [[Dominic Greene (James Bond)|Dominic Greene]] and [[Raoul Silva]] as agents of the same organisation, which Swann identifies as [[SPECTRE|Spectre]].\n\nSwann takes Bond to L'Am\u00e9ricain, a hotel in [[Tangier]], and they discover that White left evidence directing them to Oberhauser's base at a crater in the [[Sahara]]. Taking a train to a remote station, Bond and Swann encounter Hinx, who gets ejected from the train in the ensuing fight, and are escorted to Oberhauser's base. Oberhauser reveals that Spectre has funded the Joint Intelligence Service while staging terrorist attacks around the world, creating a need for the Nine Eyes programme. In return, C will give Spectre unlimited access to intelligence gathered by Nine Eyes, allowing them to anticipate and counter-act investigations into their operations. Bond is tortured as Oberhauser discusses their shared history: after the younger Bond was orphaned, Oberhauser's father, Hannes, became his temporary guardian. Believing that Bond supplanted his role as son, Oberhauser killed his father, staged his own death, adopted the name [[Ernst Stavro Blofeld]] and went on to form Spectre and target Bond. Bond and Swann stun Blofeld by setting off an explosive wristwatch at his face, and the two escape to London to prevent Nine Eyes from going online.\n\nIn London, Bond and Swann meet M, [[Bill Tanner]], Q, and Moneypenny with the intention of arresting C. Swann and Bond are abducted separately by Spectre operatives, while the rest of the group proceed with the plan. After Q succeeds in preventing the Nine Eyes from going online, a struggle between M and C ends with C falling to his death. Bond is taken to the ruins of the old [[SIS Building|MI6 building]], scheduled for demolition after Silva's bombing.{{refn|group=N|As depicted in ''[[Skyfall]]''.}} Blofeld, still alive, but now scarred over his right eye, tells Bond that he must escape before explosives are detonated in three minutes' time, or die trying to save Swann. Bond finds Swann and they escape by boat as the building collapses. Bond shoots down Blofeld's helicopter, which crashes onto [[Westminster Bridge]]. As Blofeld crawls from the wreckage, Bond confronts him but rather than kill him, leaves him to be arrested by M, before leaving the bridge with Swann. \n\nThe next morning, Bond borrows the repaired [[Aston Martin DB5]] from Q and drives away with Swann.\n\n=== Vehicles featured ===\n*[[Aston Martin DB10]]\n\n* [[Jaguar C-X75]]\n* [[Aston Martin DB5]]\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Daniel Craig]] as [[James Bond filmography|James Bond]], agent 007.
