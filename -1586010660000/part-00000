It is located near [[Al Waleed (town)|Al Walid]] town close to the [[Baghdad\u2013Amman highway]] in the [[Al Anbar]] desert west of Iraq, near the Jordanian border and 1000&nbsp;km from the Iranian borders. It was erected to secure the western borders of Iraq and was also used in the [[Yom Kippur War]] in 1973.{{citation needed|date=September 2015}}\n\nAccording to Iraqi sources, during the [[Iran\u2013Iraq War]], it was used as a support airbase for the [[Iraqi Air Force]] and housed no more than a few transportation squadrons and a squadron of [[Mikoyan-Gurevich MiG-21]]s, as well as retired [[Hawker Hunter]]s.<ref>''[https://books.google.com/books/about/Iraqi_Fighters.html?id=waSstwAACAAJ&redir_esc=y Iraqi Fighters: 1953-2003: Camouflage & Markings''] {{ISBN|978-0615214146}}</ref>\n\nThe IRIAF had received \"credible\" reports that Iraq \u2013 reinforced by the arrival of large amounts of ammunition and spare parts from Egypt, as well as by the delivery of [[Mirage F1]]s from France and [[Tupolev Tu-22]] bombers from the Soviets<ref name=jamaran /> \u2013 had been preparing for an imminent major ground and air offensive against Iran.<ref name=BishopCooper2000 /> According to Iranian intelligence, the Iraqi Air Force had relocated most of its valuable assets to its Al-Walid air base, located in the H-3 complex.\n\nAs part of [[Saddam Hussein]]'s attempts to carry out a successful offensive against Iran on the northern front between 12 and 22 March 1981, Iraq fired two [[9K52 Luna-M]] surface-to-surface rockets against the cities of [[Dezful]] and [[Ahvaz]]. Within days after this attack, commanders of the 31st and 32nd Tactical Fighter Wing in [[Shahrokhi Air Base]] (TAB 3, near [[Hamadan]]) planned a counter-attack to degrade the Iraqi Air Force's capabilities.\n\n===The attack===\nBeing almost 1500 kilometres from the Iranian fighters at Shahrokhi Air Base, H-3 was out of range and if choosing a direct route, the Iranian aircraft would have had to fly over [[Baghdad]] and perform [[aerial refueling]] twice in Iraqi airspace, including once near Baghdad, which was heavily fortified by Iraqi air defence sites.<ref name=jamaran />\n\nA team of IRIAF commanders (including Col. [[Bahram Hooshyar]] and Col. Fereydoun Izadseta) planned a more sophisticated, surprise operation instead. Senior Iranian military officials had determined that Iraqi Air Force activity was lower in northern Iraq, so a plan was made to approach the Iraqi sites from that direction. To increase their chances, the Iranian commanders decided to fly their aircraft to [[Urmia Lake]] first and refuel in the air, and then from there they would have a \"clean\" route passing over the mountains of northern Iraqi\u2013Turkish border, while keeping the altitude at less than 300&nbsp;ft (100&nbsp;m) to avoid Iraqi and Turkish [[radar]]s.<ref name=BishopCooper2000>{{cite book|last1=Bishop|first1=Farzad|last2=Cooper|first2=Tom|title=Iran-Iraq War in the Air, 1980-1988.|date=2000|publisher=Schiffer Pub.|location=Atglen|isbn=9780764316692|page=119}}</ref><ref name=aja /> The route was around 3,500&nbsp;km.<ref name=Bishop2014 /> Nevertheless, the Phantoms could not reach their target without aerial refuelling a number of times.<ref name=BishopCooper2000 />\n\nThe 31st and 32nd Tactical Fighter Wings (TFW) employed eight [[McDonnell Douglas F-4 Phantom II|McDonnell Douglas F-4E Phantom]]s, four [[Grumman F-14 Tomcat|Grumman F-14A Tomcat]]s, one [[Lockheed C-130 Hercules|Lockheed C-130H Khofaash]], a [[Boeing 747]] airborne command post (which was to monitor Iraqi radio communications, and also act as a communication relay between the raiders and the IRIAF HQ), and two tankers (a [[Boeing 707]] and a [[Boeing 747]]) for aerial refueling for the attack.<ref name=BishopCooper2000 /><ref name=MEMIM>{{cite web|url=http://memim.com/h3-airstrike.html|title=H3 airstrike|author=<!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.-->|date=|website=MEMIM Encyclopedia|publisher=|access-date=20 January 2016|quote=|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160129042258/http://memim.com/h3-airstrike.html|archive-date=29 January 2016|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Operation H3 map.png|thumb|right|alt=A map of Iraq showing the aircraft involved and their route.|Map of the operation, showing the aircraft involved and their route.]]\n\nThe operation began at 10:30am of 4 April 1981. A formation of eight F-4 Phantoms (including six F-4Es and two F-4Ds), accompanied by two airborne reserves, departed from [[Hamedan Air Base]] (TAB 3) and proceeded towards [[Urmia Lake]] and then, after refueling in friendly airspace, crossed into Iraq, while the two reserve aircraft returned. A pair of F-14 Tomcats patrolled the area hours before and after the strike began to counter any interception attempts by the Iraqi Air Force. Meanwhile, three [[Northrop F-5|Northrop F-5E]]s from [[Tabriz Air Base]] ([[TFB.2]]) performed diversionary attacks on [[Kirkuk Air Base|Hurriya Air Base]] near [[Kirkuk]], with unknown results, but certainly distracting Iraqis away from the Phantoms.<ref name=BishopCooper2000 /><ref name=jamaran>{{cite web|url=http://www.jamaran.ir/fa/NewsContent-id_23309.aspx|title=\u0639\u0645\u0644\u06cc\u0627\u062a \u0627\u0686-3 \u06cc\u06a9\u06cc \u0627\u0632 \u067e\u06cc\u0686\u06cc\u062f\u0647 \u062a\u0631\u06cc\u0646 \u0646\u0642\u0634\u0647 \u0647\u0627\u06cc \u062d\u0645\u0644\u0647 \u0647\u0648\u0627\u06cc\u06cc \u062c\u0647\u0627\u0646 \u0627\u0633\u062a|publisher=}}</ref> The C-130H was flying near the Iran\u2013Iraq border. Some time earlier, the two tankers, which already had been sent to Syria, had taken off from a Syrian airport, and then clandestinely diverted from international commercial corridors in total radio silence, while apparently being bound for Iran. Flying at a very low altitude over southern Turkey and eastern Syria, they crossed mountainous northwestern Iraq and finally joined the Phantoms over the western Iraqi desert. Each Phantom refueled four times from the tankers, at the altitude of 300&nbsp;ft (100&nbsp;m), which was risky and far below any safety standards<ref name=BishopCooper2000 /> (aerial refueling is normally performed at 22,000&nbsp;ft).<ref name=aja /> This was done to avoid detection by Iraqi radars; however, the fighters briefly appeared several times on the radars, but were mistaken for Turkish aircraft patrolling the border. Colonel Izadseta supervised the operation from a command Boeing 747 that was in Syria's airspace. The Syrian [[Palmyra Airport|airport at Palmyra]] could also be used for possible emergency landing.\n\nWhile approaching the airbases, the Phantoms split their formation into two groups, ''Alvand'' and ''Alborz''. This allowed attacks to come from several directions on the H3 complex. They bombed all three airfields within the H-3 complex.<ref name=Bishop2014 /> Achieving complete surprise, the fighters made several passes against all three airbases. Both runways at Al-Walid were targeted in order to prevent any Iraqi aircraft from taking off. Cluster bombs of the second group of Phantoms damaged three large [[hangar]]s. The Phantoms were able to make multiple attacks on multiple targets with cannon fire. By the end of the second group's attack the Iraqi military forces had not responded with a coordinated counter-attack. Effective [[anti-aircraft]] fire was also impaired due to the surprise attack. Iraqi aircraft were scrambled in an unsuccessful attempt to intercept the Iranian force.\n\nAfter the attack, the Iranian formation turned back towards its own bases. Iranian military officials stated that all Iranian Phantoms were undamaged during the attack.<ref name=\"target p7-8\">Cooper and Bishop ''Air Enthusiast'' March/April 2004, pp. 7\u20138.</ref>\n\n===Casualties===\nThe IRIAF claimed it destroyed a total of three [[Antonov An-12|Antonov An-12BP]] transports, a [[Tupolev Tu-16]] bomber, four [[Mikoyan-Gurevich MiG-21]]s, five [[Sukhoi Su-17|Sukhoi Su-20/22s]], eight [[Mikoyan-Gurevich MiG-23]]s, two [[Dassault Mirage F1|Dassault Mirage F1EQs]] (delivered only weeks earlier) and four helicopters,<ref name=Bishop2014>{{cite book|last1=Bishop|first1=Farzad|title=Iranian F-4 Phantom II Units in Combat|date=2014|publisher=Osprey Pub.|location=London|isbn=9781782007081|page=15}}</ref> as well as damaging eleven others beyond repair, including two Tu-16 bombers. Two Iraqi pilots and fourteen personnel were killed, together with three Egyptian and an East German officer, while 19 Iraqis, four Egyptians, and two Jordanians were badly injured. This strike degraded Iraq's capability to retaliate.<ref name=\"Fire\">Fire in the Hills: Iranian and Iraqi Battles of Autumn 1982, by Tom Cooper & Farzad Bishop, 9 Sept. 2003</ref>\n\nAccording to Iranian intelligence, prior to the attack there were at least two squadrons equipped with ten [[Tupolev Tu-22|Tupolev Tu-22B]] and at least six [[Tupolev Tu-16]] heavy bombers, as well as two other units with MiG-23BNs and Su-20s, which were hidden in the hangars. This has been disputed by Iraqi officials. Iraqi sources claimed that only a single MiG-21 was damaged by the attack; that the damaged hangars were empty at the time of the attack; and that its Tu-22s and Tu-16s were stationed at [[Al-Taqaddum Air Base|Tammuz Airbase]] due to the ongoing war with Iran. Iraq claimed that the bombers were stationed at Tammuz until they were retired from the Iraqi Air Force in the late 1980s, and then were bombed in 1991 during the [[Gulf War]].<ref>[http://www.algardenia.com/thaqafawaadab/9186-1931-2003.html ''The Power and the Strategic Role of the Iraqi Air Force 1931-2003''] Lt.

Within days after this attack, commanders of the 31st and 32nd Tactical Fighter Wing in [[Shahrokhi Air Base]] (TAB 3, near [[Hamadan]]) planned a counter-attack to degrade the Iraqi Air Force's capabilities.\n\n===The attack===\nBeing almost 1500 kilometres from the Iranian fighters at Shahrokhi Air Base, H-3 was out of range and if choosing a direct route, the Iranian aircraft would have had to fly over [[Baghdad]] and perform [[aerial refueling]] twice in Iraqi airspace, including once near Baghdad, which was heavily fortified by Iraqi air defence sites.<ref name=jamaran />\n\nA team of IRIAF commanders (including Col. [[Bahram Hooshyar]] and Col. Fereydoun Izadseta) planned a more sophisticated, surprise operation instead. Senior Iranian military officials had determined that Iraqi Air Force activity was lower in northern Iraq, so a plan was made to approach the Iraqi sites from that direction. To increase their chances, the Iranian commanders decided to fly their aircraft to [[Urmia Lake]] first and refuel in the air, and then from there they would have a \"clean\" route passing over the mountains of northern Iraqi\u2013Turkish border, while keeping the altitude at less than 300&nbsp;ft (100&nbsp;m) to avoid Iraqi and Turkish [[radar]]s.<ref name=BishopCooper2000>{{cite book|last1=Bishop|first1=Farzad|last2=Cooper|first2=Tom|title=Iran-Iraq War in the Air, 1980-1988.|date=2000|publisher=Schiffer Pub.|location=Atglen|isbn=9780764316692|page=119}}</ref><ref name=aja /> The route was around 3,500&nbsp;km.<ref name=Bishop2014 /> Nevertheless, the Phantoms could not reach their target without aerial refuelling a number of times.<ref name=BishopCooper2000 />\n\nThe 31st and 32nd Tactical Fighter Wings (TFW) employed eight [[McDonnell Douglas F-4 Phantom II|McDonnell Douglas F-4E Phantom]]s, four [[Grumman F-14 Tomcat|Grumman F-14A Tomcat]]s, one [[Lockheed C-130 Hercules|Lockheed C-130H Khofaash]], a [[Boeing 747]] airborne command post (which was to monitor Iraqi radio communications, and also act as a communication relay between the raiders and the IRIAF HQ), and two tankers (a [[Boeing 707]] and a [[Boeing 747]]) for aerial refueling for the attack.<ref name=BishopCooper2000 /><ref name=MEMIM>{{cite web|url=http://memim.com/h3-airstrike.html|title=H3 airstrike|author=<!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.-->|date=|website=MEMIM Encyclopedia|publisher=|access-date=20 January 2016|quote=|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160129042258/http://memim.com/h3-airstrike.html|archive-date=29 January 2016|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Operation H3 map.png|thumb|right|alt=A map of Iraq showing the aircraft involved and their route.|Map of the operation, showing the aircraft involved and their route.]]\n\nThe operation began at 10:30am of 4 April 1981. A formation of eight F-4 Phantoms (including six F-4Es and two F-4Ds), accompanied by two airborne reserves, departed from [[Hamedan Air Base]] (TAB 3) and proceeded towards [[Urmia Lake]] and then, after refueling in friendly airspace, crossed into Iraq, while the two reserve aircraft returned. A pair of F-14 Tomcats patrolled the area hours before and after the strike began to counter any interception attempts by the Iraqi Air Force. Meanwhile, three [[Northrop F-5|Northrop F-5E]]s from [[Tabriz Air Base]] ([[TFB.2]]) performed diversionary attacks on [[Kirkuk Air Base|Hurriya Air Base]] near [[Kirkuk]], with unknown results, but certainly distracting Iraqis away from the Phantoms.<ref name=BishopCooper2000 /><ref name=jamaran>{{cite web|url=http://www.jamaran.ir/fa/NewsContent-id_23309.aspx|title=\u0639\u0645\u0644\u06cc\u0627\u062a \u0627\u0686-3 \u06cc\u06a9\u06cc \u0627\u0632 \u067e\u06cc\u0686\u06cc\u062f\u0647 \u062a\u0631\u06cc\u0646 \u0646\u0642\u0634\u0647 \u0647\u0627\u06cc \u062d\u0645\u0644\u0647 \u0647\u0648\u0627\u06cc\u06cc \u062c\u0647\u0627\u0646 \u0627\u0633\u062a|publisher=}}</ref> The C-130H was flying near the Iran\u2013Iraq border. Some time earlier, the two tankers, which already had been sent to Syria, had taken off from a Syrian airport, and then clandestinely diverted from international commercial corridors in total radio silence, while apparently being bound for Iran. Flying at a very low altitude over southern Turkey and eastern Syria, they crossed mountainous northwestern Iraq and finally joined the Phantoms over the western Iraqi desert. Each Phantom refueled four times from the tankers, at the altitude of 300&nbsp;ft (100&nbsp;m), which was risky and far below any safety standards<ref name=BishopCooper2000 /> (aerial refueling is normally performed at 22,000&nbsp;ft).<ref name=aja /> This was done to avoid detection by Iraqi radars; however, the fighters briefly appeared several times on the radars, but were mistaken for Turkish aircraft patrolling the border. Colonel Izadseta supervised the operation from a command Boeing 747 that was in Syria's airspace. The Syrian [[Palmyra Airport|airport at Palmyra]] could also be used for possible emergency landing.\n\nWhile approaching the airbases, the Phantoms split their formation into two groups, ''Alvand'' and ''Alborz''. This allowed attacks to come from several directions on the H3 complex. They bombed all three airfields within the H-3 complex.<ref name=Bishop2014 /> Achieving complete surprise, the fighters made several passes against all three airbases. Both runways at Al-Walid were targeted in order to prevent any Iraqi aircraft from taking off. Cluster bombs of the second group of Phantoms damaged three large [[hangar]]s. The Phantoms were able to make multiple attacks on multiple targets with cannon fire. By the end of the second group's attack the Iraqi military forces had not responded with a coordinated counter-attack. Effective [[anti-aircraft]] fire was also impaired due to the surprise attack. Iraqi aircraft were scrambled in an unsuccessful attempt to intercept the Iranian force.\n\nAfter the attack, the Iranian formation turned back towards its own bases. Iranian military officials stated that all Iranian Phantoms were undamaged during the attack.<ref name=\"target p7-8\">Cooper and Bishop ''Air Enthusiast'' March/April 2004, pp. 7\u20138.</ref>\n\n===Casualties===\nThe IRIAF claimed it destroyed a total of three [[Antonov An-12|Antonov An-12BP]] transports, a [[Tupolev Tu-16]] bomber, four [[Mikoyan-Gurevich MiG-21]]s, five [[Sukhoi Su-17|Sukhoi Su-20/22s]], eight [[Mikoyan-Gurevich MiG-23]]s, two [[Dassault Mirage F1|Dassault Mirage F1EQs]] (delivered only weeks earlier) and four helicopters,<ref name=Bishop2014>{{cite book|last1=Bishop|first1=Farzad|title=Iranian F-4 Phantom II Units in Combat|date=2014|publisher=Osprey Pub.|location=London|isbn=9781782007081|page=15}}</ref> as well as damaging eleven others beyond repair, including two Tu-16 bombers.

This has been disputed by Iraqi officials. Iraqi sources claimed that only a single MiG-21 was damaged by the attack; that the damaged hangars were empty at the time of the attack; and that its Tu-22s and Tu-16s were stationed at [[Al-Taqaddum Air Base|Tammuz Airbase]] due to the ongoing war with Iran. Iraq claimed that the bombers were stationed at Tammuz until they were retired from the Iraqi Air Force in the late 1980s, and then were bombed in 1991 during the [[Gulf War]].<ref>[http://www.algardenia.com/thaqafawaadab/9186-1931-2003.html ''The Power and the Strategic Role of the Iraqi Air Force 1931-2003''] Lt.

Some of them are perennial in nature, others come up on an annual basis while others are biennial in nature. The perennial ones are often very difficult to control. They keep regenerating despite every effort to control them. The annual and biennial ones are easier to deal with. Looking at their visual nature, broadleaf weeds have wide leaves in common. They also have a main center vein that connects to smaller veins which shoot out from a branch. Despite this, they also differ in various  aspects.<ref name=\"MISS\"/>\n\nMost broadleaf weeds develop clusters of blossoms or single flowers as they mature. Such flowers are not aesthetic in nature. They often come in diverse colors such as white, blue, purple, red and so on. Some of them come with  mixed colored flowers while others bear single colored flowers. Despite this, they still appear  unruffled when clustered around a yard or lawn.\n\nThe roots of most broadleaf weeds are fibrous in nature. Some of them spring up with thin roots. Others spring up with a massive taproot while some of them spring up with both types of root systems.  A good number of broadleaf weeds spread through their seeds and rhizomes. Some of them only spread through seeds while others spread through seeds and rhizomes.<ref name=\"UPS\"/>\n\n==Common broadleaf weeds==\nThere are several types of broadleaf weeds  growing in lawns, gardens and yards across the globe.<ref>{{cite news | last = | first =| title =Broadleaf Weeds| newspaper =| location = | pages = | language = | publisher =plantscience.psu.edu| date = | url =https://plantscience.psu.edu/research/centers/turf/extension/plant-id/broadleaf | accessdate =30 May 2019}}</ref> Outlined below are the most common broadleaf weeds with their [[Binomial nomenclature|binomial names]]:\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

Generally, most common weed plants  belong to one of two weed families namely, ''broadleaf (dicotyledon)'' or ''narrow leaf (monocotyledon)''.  Broadleaf  weeds grow from  tap roots or fibrous root systems and have larger leaves.  Narrow leaf weeds are also referred to as grasses.  They have fibrous roots systems and long narrow leaves.<ref>{{cite news | last =Tilley | first =Nikki | title =What Is A Weed: Weed Info And Control Methods In The Garden\n| newspaper =| location = | pages = | language = | publisher =gardeningknowhow.com| date = | url =https://www.gardeningknowhow.com/plant-problems/weeds/what-is-a-weed.htm | accessdate =30 May 2019}}</ref>\n\nMost broadleaf weeds have leaves with net-like veins.  They also have  nodes that contain one or more leaves.  They may have showy flowers.  On the other hand, narrow weeds or grasses do not have net-like veins and nodes that contain more leaves.  They can be flat in nature.  Moreover, broadleaf weed have seedlings that come up with two leaves.  This is not the case with grasses that can easily spring up at any given time.<ref>{{cite news | last = | first =| title =Broadleaf Weeds| newspaper =| location = | pages = | language = | publisher =hgic.clemson.edu| date = | url =https://hgic.clemson.edu/factsheet/broadleaf-weeds/| accessdate =30 May 2019}}</ref>\n\nFurthermore, grassy weeds  are so called because they spring up as desirable grasses.{{Clarify|date=April 2020}}  This makes them very hard to be identified when comparing them with broadleaf weeds.  Grassy weed  come up with blades which showcase as a single leaf from a germinated grass seed.  This makes them quite different from broadleaf weeds especially in appearance.<ref>{{cite news | last = | first =| title =The Differences Between Broadleaf and Grassy Weeds| newspaper =| location = | pages = | language = | publisher =cardinallawns.com| date =7 July 2016 | url =https://www.cardinallawns.com/2016/07/differences-between-broadleaf-grassy-weeds/| accessdate =30 May 2019}}</ref>\n\n==Methods of controlling==\nAlthough broadleaf weeds  are known to be aggressive and tough in nature, they can still be controlled. The gardens, yards and lawns are the most common place they thrive.  There are several ways of controlling them.<ref name=\"NEWS\">{{cite news | last =Trapp | first =Abby | title =Plan a strategy for weed control |work=News-Press NOW |date=28 May 2019 | url =http://www.newspressnow.com/news/local_news/plan-a-strategy-for-weed-control/article_d6d4f086-7db5-11e9-8117-833bed713e1d.html| accessdate =30 May 2019}}</ref>\n\n===Detecting their growth cycle===\n{{Clarify section|date=April 2020}}\nOne of the best ways of dealing with broadleaf weeds is to detect their growth cycle.  This requires proper monitoring.  Most  plants experts use this method since it has been proven to be the most effective.  It involves discovering how  broadleaf weeds grow and depriving them on that growth cycle.<ref name=\"SC\">{{cite web |title=Learn more about Broadleaf Weeds |website=sciencedirect.com |url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/agricultural-and-biological-sciences/broadleaf-weeds |access-date=30 May 2019}}{{Unreliable source?|date=December 2019}}</ref>\n\n===Using a weed killer===\nIn situations where there are massive growth of broadleaf weeds, using a good weed killer can be very helpful.  This is usually the case for lawns or  yards that are overgrown with such weeds. There are several good weed killers available in the market.  It is also important to seek the advice of a  weed plant expert  when looking for a weed killer.<ref name=\"NEWS\"/>\n\n===Hand-picking===\nIn lawns, gardens or yards where there are few broadleaf weeds present, the best approach to use is hand-pulling.  This should be carried out from time to time in order to check the spread weeds.<ref name=\"SC\"/>\n\n===Lawn mowing===\nIn a thick lawn that is overgrown with broadleaf weeds, the lawn moving method is considered the best approach.  This involves the use of a lawn mower in uprooting the weed.  It can be very tedious especially in situations where there are massive growth of the broadleaf weeds.<ref name=\"TUR\"/>\n\n===Use of chemical herbicides===\nThere are chemical herbicides meant for controlling broadleaf weeds.  The use of such chemicals is often the best option when thinking of clearing the entire yard or lawn of all manner of weeds.  In most cases, the chemical content prevent the weeds from re-surfacing for several months.   The perennial types of broadleaf weeds are often controlled with chemical herbicides although they still find their way back after some months  especially when the cleared lawn or yard is  left unused for months.<ref>{{cite news |title=Broadleaf Weed Problems in Lawns |website=LawnTalk |publisher=University of Illinois Extension |url=https://extension.illinois.edu/lawntalk/weeds/broadleaf_weed_problems_in_lawns.cfm |access-date=30 May 2019}}</ref>\n\n===Shading out===\nBroadleaf weeds can be controlled by shading them out.  This involves covering the entire affected area with flat materials such as boards, nylon, plastic spread,  and the like.  When broadleaf weeds are covered that way, they lack access to sunlight and rain that speed up their growth. By so doing, they wither away.<ref name=\"TUR\"/>\n\n==See also==\n* [[Weed]]\n* [[List of common weeds of Queensland]]\n* [[Weed control]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|2}}\n\n\n{{Use dmy dates|date=April 2020}}\n\n\n[[Category:Garden pests]]\n[[Category:Plants and humans]]\n[[Category:Agricultural pests]]\n", "text_old": "{{Copyedit|date=April 2020}}\n'''Broadleaf weeds''' are unwanted pugnacious and tough plants that grow mostly around free areas in a lawn, garden or yard.<ref name=\"MISS\">{{cite news | last = | first =| title =Perennial Broadleaf Weeds in Lawns| newspaper =| location = | pages = | language = | publisher =missouribotanicalgarden.org| date = | url =http://www.missouribotanicalgarden.org/gardens-gardening/your-garden/help-for-the-home-gardener/advice-tips-resources/pests-and-problems/weeds/broadleaf-weeds.aspx | accessdate =30 May 2019}}</ref> They are often very easy to spot because they are different from normal grasses.<ref name=\"UPS\">{{cite news | last = | first =| title =Identify the weeds in your lawn and get rid of them| newspaper =| location = | pages = | language = | publisher =upscalelivingmag.com| date = | url =https://www.upscalelivingmag.com/identify-weeds-lawn-get-rid-good/ | accessdate =30 May 2019}}</ref> They  multiply with ease and can be very hard to control.<ref name=\"TUR\">{{cite news | last = | first =| title =5 Tips To Enhance Broadleaf Weed Control| newspaper =| location = | pages = | language = | publisher =turfmagazine.com| date = | url =https://www.turfmagazine.com/lawn-care/5-tips-to-enhance-broadleaf-weed-control/ | accessdate =30 May 2019}}</ref>\n\n==Basic characteristics==\nBroadleaf weeds generally do not spring up in one specific pattern. Some of them are perennial in nature, others come up on an annual basis while others are biennial in nature. The perennial ones are often very difficult to control. They keep regenerating despite every effort to control them. The annual and biennial ones are easier to deal with. Looking at their visual nature, broadleaf weeds have wide leaves in common. They also have a main center vein that connects to smaller veins which shoot out from a branch. Despite this, they also differ in various  aspects.<ref name=\"MISS\"/>\n\nMost broadleaf weeds develop clusters of blossoms or single flowers as they mature. Such flowers are not aesthetic in nature. They often come in diverse colors such as white, blue, purple, red and so on. Some of them come with  mixed colored flowers while others bear single colored flowers. Despite this, they still appear  unruffled when clustered around a yard or lawn.\n\nThe roots of most broadleaf weeds are fibrous in nature. Some of them spring up with thin roots. Others spring up with a massive taproot while some of them spring up with both types of root systems.  A good number of broadleaf weeds spread through their seeds and rhizomes. Some of them only spread through seeds while others spread through seeds and rhizomes.<ref name=\"UPS\"/>\n\n==Common broadleaf weeds==\nThere are several types of broadleaf weeds  growing in lawns, gardens and yards across the globe.<ref>{{cite news | last = | first =| title =Broadleaf Weeds| newspaper =| location = | pages = | language = | publisher =plantscience.psu.edu| date = | url =https://plantscience.psu.edu/research/centers/turf/extension/plant-id/broadleaf | accessdate =30 May 2019}}</ref> Outlined below are the most common broadleaf weeds with their [[Binomial nomenclature|binomial names]]:\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

It comes with an alternate leaf arrangement and has a taproot with secondary fibrous root system.<ref>{{cite news | last = | first =| title =Thistle Bull, Cirsium vulgare| newspaper =| location = | pages = | language = | publisher =plantscience.psu.edu| date = | url =https://plantscience.psu.edu/research/centers/turf/extension/plant-id/broadleaf/bull-thistle | accessdate =30 May 2019}}</ref>\n\n===Violets - ''Viola papilonacea''===\n{{Main|Viola (plant)}}\nViolets are also referred to as the ''hooded blue violet'' or ''meadow-violet''.  It is a typical example of perennial broadleaf weed that spreads with ease.  It propagates through its seeds or rhizomes and bears blue or purple flower. It comes with heart-shaped leaf structure and a coarse root system.<ref>{{cite news | last = | first =| title =Violets - Viola papilonace| newspaper =| location = | pages = | language = | publisher =plantscience.psu.edu| date = | url =https://plantscience.psu.edu/research/centers/turf/extension/plant-id/broadleaf/violet | accessdate =30 May 2019}}</ref>\n\n==Contrast with other types of weeds==\nThe differences in broadleaf weeds structure and their  growth habits make them easy to be distinguished from grasses.  Generally, most common weed plants  belong to one of two weed families namely, ''broadleaf (dicotyledon)'' or ''narrow leaf (monocotyledon)''.  Broadleaf  weeds grow from  tap roots or fibrous root systems and have larger leaves.  Narrow leaf weeds are also referred to as grasses.  They have fibrous roots systems and long narrow leaves.<ref>{{cite news | last =Tilley | first =Nikki | title =What Is A Weed: Weed Info And Control Methods In The Garden\n| newspaper =| location = | pages = | language = | publisher =gardeningknowhow.com| date = | url =https://www.gardeningknowhow.com/plant-problems/weeds/what-is-a-weed.htm | accessdate =30 May 2019}}</ref>\n\nMost broadleaf weeds have leaves with net-like veins.  They also have  nodes that contain one or more leaves.  They may have showy flowers.  On the other hand, narrow weeds or grasses do not have net-like veins and nodes that contain more leaves.  They can be flat in nature.  Moreover, broadleaf weed have seedlings that come up with two leaves.  This is not the case with grasses that can easily spring up at any given time.<ref>{{cite news | last = | first =| title =Broadleaf Weeds| newspaper =| location = | pages = | language = | publisher =hgic.clemson.edu| date = | url =https://hgic.clemson.edu/factsheet/broadleaf-weeds/| accessdate =30 May 2019}}</ref>\n\nFurthermore, grassy weeds  are so called because they spring up as desirable grasses.{{Clarify|date=April 2020}}  This makes them very hard to be identified when comparing them with broadleaf weeds.  Grassy weed  come up with blades which showcase as a single leaf from a germinated grass seed.  This makes them quite different from broadleaf weeds especially in appearance.<ref>{{cite news | last = | first =| title =The Differences Between Broadleaf and Grassy Weeds| newspaper =| location = | pages = | language = | publisher =cardinallawns.com| date =7 July 2016 | url =https://www.cardinallawns.com/2016/07/differences-between-broadleaf-grassy-weeds/| accessdate =30 May 2019}}</ref>\n\n==Methods of controlling==\nAlthough broadleaf weeds  are known to be aggressive and tough in nature, they can still be controlled. The gardens, yards and lawns are the most common place they thrive.  There are several ways of controlling them.<ref name=\"NEWS\">{{cite news | last =Trapp | first =Abby | title =Plan a strategy for weed control |work=News-Press NOW |date=28 May 2019 | url =http://www.newspressnow.com/news/local_news/plan-a-strategy-for-weed-control/article_d6d4f086-7db5-11e9-8117-833bed713e1d.html| accessdate =30 May 2019}}</ref>\n\n===Detecting their growth cycle===\n{{Clarify section|date=April 2020}}\nOne of the best ways of dealing with broadleaf weeds is to detect their growth cycle.  This requires proper monitoring.  Most  plants experts use this method since it has been proven to be the most effective.  It involves discovering how  broadleaf weeds grow and depriving them on that growth cycle.<ref name=\"SC\">{{cite web |title=Learn more about Broadleaf Weeds |website=sciencedirect.com |url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/agricultural-and-biological-sciences/broadleaf-weeds |access-date=30 May 2019}}{{Unreliable source?|date=December 2019}}</ref>\n\n===Using a weed killer===\nIn situations where there are massive growth of broadleaf weeds, using a good weed killer can be very helpful.  This is usually the case for lawns or  yards that are overgrown with such weeds. There are several good weed killers available in the market.  It is also important to seek the advice of a  weed plant expert  when looking for a weed killer.<ref name=\"NEWS\"/>\n\n===Hand-picking===\nIn lawns, gardens or yards where there are few broadleaf weeds present, the best approach to use is hand-pulling.  This should be carried out from time to time in order to check the spread weeds.<ref name=\"SC\"/>\n\n===Lawn mowing===\nIn a thick lawn that is overgrown with broadleaf weeds, the lawn moving method is considered the best approach.  This involves the use of a lawn mower in uprooting the weed.  It can be very tedious especially in situations where there are massive growth of the broadleaf weeds.<ref name=\"TUR\"/>\n\n===Use of chemical herbicides===\nThere are chemical herbicides meant for controlling broadleaf weeds.  The use of such chemicals is often the best option when thinking of clearing the entire yard or lawn of all manner of weeds.  In most cases, the chemical content prevent the weeds from re-surfacing for several months.   The perennial types of broadleaf weeds are often controlled with chemical herbicides although they still find their way back after some months  especially when the cleared lawn or yard is  left unused for months.<ref>{{cite news |title=Broadleaf Weed Problems in Lawns |website=LawnTalk |publisher=University of Illinois Extension |url=https://extension.illinois.edu/lawntalk/weeds/broadleaf_weed_problems_in_lawns.cfm |access-date=30 May 2019}}</ref>\n\n===Shading out===\nBroadleaf weeds can be controlled by shading them out.  This involves covering the entire affected area with flat materials such as boards, nylon, plastic spread,  and the like.  When broadleaf weeds are covered that way, they lack access to sunlight and rain that speed up their growth. By so doing, they wither away.<ref name=\"TUR\"/>\n\n==See also==\n* [[Weed]]\n* [[List of common weeds of Queensland]]\n* [[Weed control]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|2}}\n\n\n{{Use dmy dates|date=April 2020}}\n\n\n[[Category:Garden pests]]\n[[Category:Plants and humans]]\n[[Category:Agricultural pests]]\n", "name_user": "Llunnaz", "label": "safe", "comment": "capital letter in the beginning of the sentence", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Broadleaf_weeds"}

NNWS parties to the NPT agree not to \"receive\", \"manufacture\", or \"acquire\" nuclear weapons or to \"seek or receive any assistance in the manufacture of nuclear weapons\" (Article II).

However, these undertakings have not been incorporated formally into the treaty, and the exact details have varied over time. The U.S. also had nuclear warheads targeted at North Korea, a non-NWS, from 1959 until 1991.

It was recognized that the [[Cold War]] deterrent relationship between just the [[United States]] and the [[Soviet Union]] was fragile. Having more nuclear-weapon states would reduce security for all, multiplying the risks of miscalculation, accidents, unauthorized use of weapons, escalation in tensions, and nuclear conflict. Moreover, since the use of nuclear weapons in Hiroshima and Nagasaki in 1945, it has been apparent that the development of nuclear capabilities by States could enable them to divert technology and materials for weapons purposes. Thus, the problem of preventing such diversions became a central issue in discussions on peaceful uses of nuclear energy.\n\nInitial efforts, which began in 1946, to create an international system enabling all States to have access to nuclear technology under appropriate safeguards, were terminated in 1949 without the achievement of this objective, due to serious political differences between the major Powers. By then, both the United States and the former Soviet Union had tested nuclear weapons, and were beginning to build their stockpiles.\n\nIn December 1953, US President Dwight D. Eisenhower in his \"[[Atoms for Peace]]\" proposal, presented to the eighth session of the United Nations General Assembly, urged that an international organization be established to disseminate peaceful nuclear technology, while guarding against development of weapons capabilities in additional countries. His proposal resulted in 1957 in the establishment of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), which was charged with the dual responsibility for promotion and control of nuclear technology. IAEA technical activities began in 1958. An interim safeguards system for small nuclear reactors, put in place in 1961, was replaced in 1964 by a system covering larger installations and, over the following years, was expanded to include additional nuclear facilities. In recent years, efforts to strengthen the effectiveness and improve the efficiency of the IAEA safeguards system culminated in the approval of the Model Additional Protocol by the IAEA Board of Governors in May 1997.\n\nWithin the framework of the United Nations, the principle of nuclear non-proliferation was addressed in negotiations as early as 1957. The NPT process was launched by [[Frank Aiken]], Irish Minister for External Affairs, in 1958. The NPT gained significant momentum in the early 1960s. The structure of a treaty to uphold nuclear non-proliferation as a norm of international behaviour had become clear by the mid-1960s, and by 1968 final agreement had been reached on a Treaty that would prevent the proliferation of nuclear weapons, enable cooperation for the peaceful use of nuclear energy, and further the goal of achieving nuclear disarmament. It was opened for signature in 1968, with Finland the first [[List of parties to the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty|State to sign]]. Accession became nearly universal after the end of the [[Cold War]] and of South African [[apartheid]]. In 1992, The People's Republic of China and France acceded to the NPT, the last of the five nuclear powers recognized by the treaty to do so.\n\nThe treaty provided, in article X, for a conference to be convened 25 years after its entry into force to decide whether the treaty should continue in force indefinitely, or be extended for an additional fixed period or periods. Accordingly, at the NPT Review and Extension Conference in May 1995, state parties to the treaty agreed-without a vote-on the treaty's indefinite extension, and decided that review conferences should continue to be held every five years. After Brazil acceded to the NPT in 1998, the only remaining non-nuclear-weapon state which had not signed was Cuba, which joined the NPT (and the [[Treaty of Tlatelolco]] [[NWFZ]]) in 2002.\n\nSeveral NPT states parties have given up nuclear weapons or nuclear weapons programs. South Africa undertook a nuclear weapons program, but has since renounced it and acceded to the treaty in 1991 after destroying its small nuclear [[arsenal]]; after this, the remaining African countries signed the treaty. The [[former Soviet Republics]] where nuclear weapons had been based, namely Ukraine, Belarus and Kazakhstan, transferred those weapons to Russia and joined the NPT by 1994 following the signature of the [[Budapest Memorandum on Security Assurances]].{{citation needed|date=March 2014}}\n\nSuccessor states from the breakups of Yugoslavia and Czechoslovakia also joined the treaty soon after their independence. Montenegro and East Timor were the last countries to accede to the treaty on their independence in 2006 and 2003; the only other country to accede in the 21st century was Cuba in 2002. The three Micronesian countries in [[Compact of Free Association]] with the USA joined the NPT in 1995, along with Vanuatu.\n\nMajor South American countries Argentina, Chile, and Brazil joined in 1995 and 1998. Arabian Peninsula countries included Saudi Arabia and Bahrain in 1988, Qatar and Kuwait in 1989, UAE in 1995, and Oman in 1997. The European states of [[Monaco]] and [[Andorra]] joined in 1995\u20136. Also acceding in the 1990s were Myanmar in 1992 and Guyana in 1993.\n\n===United States\u2013NATO nuclear weapons sharing===\n{{Main|Nuclear sharing}}\n[[File:nwfz.svg|thumb|upright=1.6|\n{{legend0|#0000FF|[[Nuclear-Weapon-Free Zone]]s}}<br/>\n{{legend0|#FF0000|[[Nuclear weapons states]]}}<br/>\n{{legend0|#FF8800|[[Nuclear sharing]]}}<br/>\n{{legend0|#dddd00|Neither, but NPT}} ]]\n\nAt the time the treaty was being negotiated, [[NATO]] had in place secret [[Nuclear sharing|nuclear weapons sharing]] agreements whereby the United States provided nuclear weapons to be deployed by, and stored in, other NATO states.

Before the advent of the [[Syrian Civil War]] it was known to operate only one small Chinese-built research reactor, SRR-1. Despite being a proponent of a Weapons of Mass Destruction Free Zone in the Middle East the country was accused of pursuing a military nuclear program with a reported nuclear facility in a desert Syrian region of Deir ez-Zor. The reactor's components had likely been designed and manufactured in North Korea, with the reactor's striking similarity in shape and size to the North Korean Yongbyon Nuclear Scientific Research Center. That information alarmed Israeli military and intelligence to such a degree that the idea of a targeted airstrike was conceived. It resulted in [[Operation Orchard]], that took place on 6 September 2007  and saw as many as eight Israeli aircraft taking part. The Israeli government is said to have bounced the idea of the operation off of the US Bush administration, although the latter declined to participate. The nuclear reactor was destroyed in the attack, which also killed about ten North Korean workers. The attack did not cause an international outcry or any serious Syrian retaliatory moves as both parties tried to keep it secret: Despite a half-century state of war declared by surrounding states Israel didn't want publicity as regards its breach of the ceasefire while Syria wasn't willing to acknowledge its clandestine nuclear program.{{citation needed|date=October 2016}}\n\n==Leaving the treaty==\nArticle X allows a state to leave the treaty if \"extraordinary events, related to the subject matter of this Treaty, have jeopardized the supreme interests of its country\", giving three months' (ninety days') notice. The state is required to give reasons for leaving the NPT in this notice.\n\n[[NATO]] states argue that when there is a state of \"general war\" the treaty no longer applies, effectively allowing the states involved to leave the treaty with no notice. This is a necessary argument to support the NATO [[nuclear weapons sharing]] policy, but a troubling one for the logic of the treaty. NATO's argument is based on the phrase \"the consequent need to make every effort to avert the danger of such a war\" in the treaty preamble, inserted at the behest of U.S. diplomats, arguing that the treaty would at that point have failed to fulfill its function of prohibiting a general war and thus no longer be binding.<ref name=\"is_it_legal\"/> Many states do not accept this argument.{{who|date=April 2018}} See [[Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty#United States\u2013NATO nuclear weapons sharing|United States\u2013NATO nuclear weapons sharing]] above.\n\nNorth Korea has also caused an uproar by its use of this provision of the treaty. Article X.1 only requires a state to give three months' notice in total, and does not provide for other states to question a state's interpretation of \"supreme interests of its country\". In 1993, North Korea gave notice to withdraw from the NPT. However, after 89 days, North Korea reached agreement with the United States to freeze its nuclear program under the [[Agreed Framework]] and \"suspended\" its withdrawal notice. In October 2002, the United States accused North Korea of violating the Agreed Framework by pursuing a secret uranium enrichment program, and suspended shipments of heavy fuel oil under that agreement. In response, North Korea expelled IAEA inspectors, disabled IAEA equipment, and, on 10 January 2003, announced that it was ending the suspension of its previous NPT withdrawal notification. North Korea said that only one more day's notice was sufficient for withdrawal from the NPT, as it had given 89 days before.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.nti.org/e_research/profiles/NK/Nuclear/index.html |title=North Korea Profile \u2013 Nuclear Overview |publisher=Nti.org |accessdate=25 November 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110922050752/http://www.nti.org/e_research/profiles/NK/Nuclear/index.html |archive-date=22 September 2011 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\nThe IAEA Board of Governors rejected this interpretation.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.iaea.org/NewsCenter/MediaAdvisory/2003/med-advise_048.shtml |title=Media Advisory 2003/48 \u2013 IAEA Board of Governors Adopts Resolution on Safeguards in North Korea \u2013 12 February |publisher=Iaea.org |date= 11 February 2003|accessdate=25 November 2010}}</ref> Most countries held that a new three-months withdrawal notice was required, and some questioned whether North Korea's notification met the \"extraordinary events\" and \"supreme interests\" requirements of the treaty.

Upon entry into force, it will prohibit each state party from the development, testing, production, stockpiling, stationing, transfer, use and threat of use of nuclear weapons, as well as assistance to those activities.

commonly known as the '''Non-Proliferation Treaty''' or '''NPT''', is an international [[treaty]] whose objective is to prevent the spread of [[nuclear weapon]]s and weapons technology, to promote cooperation in the peaceful uses of [[Nuclear technology|nuclear energy]], and to further the goal of achieving [[nuclear disarmament]] and general and complete disarmament.<ref name=\"un.org\">{{cite

negotiated by the [[Eighteen Nation Committee on Disarmament]], a [[United Nations]]-sponsored organization based in [[Geneva]], [[Switzerland]].\n\nOpened for signature in 1968, the treaty entered into force in 1970. As required by the text, after twenty-five years, NPT Parties met in May 1995 and agreed to extend the treaty indefinitely.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://acronym.org.uk/old/official-and-govt-documents/decisions-adopted-1995-npt-review-extension-conference|title=Decisions Adopted at the 1995 NPT Review & Extension Conference - Acronym Institute|publisher=}}</ref> More countries have adhered to the NPT than any other arms limitation and disarmament agreement, a testament to the treaty's significance.<ref name=\"un.org\"/> As of August 2016, 191 states have ratified the treaty, though [[North Korea]], which acceded in 1985 but never came into compliance, announced its withdrawal from the NPT in 2003, following detonation of nuclear devices in violation of core obligations.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://dtirp.dtra.mil/pdfs/npt_status_2009.pdf |title=Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT) |work=[[Defense Treaty Inspection Readiness Program]] - [[United States Department of Defense]] |accessdate=19 June 2013 |publisher=[[Defense Treaty Inspection Readiness Program]] |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130311220936/http://dtirp.dtra.mil/pdfs/npt_status_2009.pdf |archivedate=11 March 2013 }}</ref> Four [[UN member states]] have never accepted the NPT, three of which possess nuclear weapons: [[India]], [[Israel]], and [[Pakistan]]. In addition, [[South Sudan]], founded in 2011, has not joined.\n\nThe treaty defines [[List of states with nuclear weapons#Five nuclear-weapon states under the NPT|nuclear-weapon states]] as those that have built and tested a nuclear explosive device before 1 January 1967; these are  the [[United States]], [[Russia]], the  [[United Kingdom]], [[France]], and [[China]].

Even though the treaty was originally conceived with a limited duration of 25 years, the signing parties decided, by consensus, to unconditionally extend the treaty indefinitely during the Review Conference in New York City on 11 May 1995, in the culmination of U.S. government efforts led by Ambassador [[Thomas Graham Jr. (diplomat)|Thomas Graham Jr.]]\n\nAt the time the NPT was proposed, there were predictions of 25\u201330 nuclear weapon states within 20 years. Instead, over forty years later, five states are not parties to the NPT, and they include the only four additional states believed to possess nuclear weapons.<ref name=\"graham2004\">{{cite web|last=Graham, Jr.|first=Thomas|url=http://www.armscontrol.org/act/2004_11/BookReview|title=Avoiding the Tipping Point|publisher=Arms Control Association|date=November 2004}}</ref> Several additional measures have been adopted to strengthen the NPT and the broader nuclear nonproliferation regime and make it difficult for states to acquire the capability to produce nuclear weapons, including the export controls of the [[Nuclear Suppliers Group]] and the enhanced verification measures of the [[International Atomic Energy Agency]] (IAEA) [[Additional Protocol]].\n\nCritics argue that the NPT cannot stop the proliferation of nuclear weapons or the motivation to acquire them. They express disappointment with the limited progress on nuclear disarmament, where the five authorized nuclear weapons states still have 22,000 warheads in their combined stockpile and have shown a reluctance to disarm further.{{dubious|date=September 2011}} Several high-ranking officials within the United Nations have said that they can do little to stop states using [[nuclear reactor]]s to produce nuclear weapons.{{dubious|date=September 2011}}<ref name=bks2011>[[Benjamin K.

An effective nonproliferation regime whose members comply with their obligations provides an essential foundation for progress on disarmament and makes possible greater cooperation on the peaceful use of nuclear energy. With the right to access the benefits of peaceful nuclear technology comes the responsibility of nonproliferation. Progress on disarmament reinforces efforts to strengthen the nonproliferation regime and to enforce compliance with obligations, thereby also facilitating peaceful nuclear cooperation.<ref name=\"state.gov\">{{cite web|url=https://2009-2017.state.gov/documents/organization/141503.pdf|work=U.S. Department of State / U.S. delegation to the 2010 nuclear nonproliferation treaty conference |title=Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons|date=2010}}</ref>\nThe \"pillars\" concept has been questioned by some who believe that the NPT is, as its name suggests, principally about nonproliferation, and who worry that \"three pillars\" language misleadingly implies that the three elements have equivalent importance.<ref>This view was expressed by Christopher Ford, the U.S. NPT representative at the end of the Bush Administration.

NNWS parties to the NPT agree not to \"receive\", \"manufacture\", or \"acquire\" nuclear weapons or to \"seek or receive any assistance in the manufacture of nuclear weapons\" (Article II). NNWS parties also agree to accept safeguards by the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) to verify that they are not diverting nuclear energy<!--\"Nuclear energy\" is verbatim from the English text of the treaty.

However, these undertakings have not been incorporated formally into the treaty, and the exact details have varied over time. The U.S. also had nuclear warheads targeted at North Korea, a non-NWS, from 1959 until 1991. The previous United Kingdom [[Secretary of State for Defence]], [[Geoff Hoon]], has also explicitly invoked the possibility of the use of the country's nuclear weapons in response to a non-conventional attack by \"[[rogue states]]\".<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/politics/1883258.stm UK 'prepared to use nuclear weapons'] BBC article dated 20 March 2002</ref> In January 2006, President [[Jacques Chirac]] of France indicated that an incident of state-sponsored terrorism on France could trigger a small-scale nuclear retaliation aimed at destroying the \"rogue state's\" power centers.<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/4627862.stm France 'would use nuclear arms'], BBC article dated 19 January 2006</ref><ref>[https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/01/19/AR2006011903311.html Chirac: Nuclear Response to Terrorism Is Possible], Washington Post article dated 20 January 2006</ref>\n\n===Second pillar: Disarmament===\nUnder Article VI of the NPT, all Parties undertake to pursue good-faith negotiations on effective measures relating to cessation of the nuclear arms race, to nuclear disarmament, and to general and complete disarmament.<ref name=\"state.gov\"/>\n\nArticle VI of the NPT represents the only binding commitment in a multilateral treaty to the goal of disarmament by the nuclear-weapon states. The NPT's preamble contains language affirming the desire of treaty signatories to ease international tension and strengthen international trust so as to create someday the conditions for a halt to the production of nuclear weapons, and treaty on general and complete disarmament that liquidates, in particular, nuclear weapons and their delivery vehicles from national arsenals.\n\nThe wording of the NPT's Article VI arguably imposes only a vague obligation on all NPT signatories to move in the general direction of nuclear and total disarmament, saying, \"Each of the Parties to the Treaty undertakes to pursue negotiations in good faith on effective measures relating to cessation of the nuclear arms race at an early date and to nuclear disarmament, and on a treaty on general and complete disarmament.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.iaea.org/Publications/Documents/Infcircs/Others/infcirc140.pdf |title=Information Circulars |work=iaea.org |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070807060917/http://www.iaea.org/Publications/Documents/Infcircs/Others/infcirc140.pdf |archivedate=7 August 2007 }}</ref> Under this interpretation, Article VI does not strictly require all signatories to actually conclude a disarmament treaty.

It was recognized that the [[Cold War]] deterrent relationship between just the [[United States]] and the [[Soviet Union]] was fragile. Having more nuclear-weapon states would reduce security for all, multiplying the risks of miscalculation, accidents, unauthorized use of weapons, escalation in tensions, and nuclear conflict. Moreover, since the use of nuclear weapons in Hiroshima and Nagasaki in 1945, it has been apparent that the development of nuclear capabilities by States could enable them to divert technology and materials for weapons purposes. Thus, the problem of preventing such diversions became a central issue in discussions on peaceful uses of nuclear energy.\n\nInitial efforts, which began in 1946, to create an international system enabling all States to have access to nuclear technology under appropriate safeguards, were terminated in 1949 without the achievement of this objective, due to serious political differences between the major Powers. By then, both the United States and the former Soviet Union had tested nuclear weapons, and were beginning to build their stockpiles.\n\nIn December 1953, US President Dwight D. Eisenhower in his \"[[Atoms for Peace]]\" proposal, presented to the eighth session of the United Nations General Assembly, urged that an international organization be established to disseminate peaceful nuclear technology, while guarding against development of weapons capabilities in additional countries. His proposal resulted in 1957 in the establishment of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), which was charged with the dual responsibility for promotion and control of nuclear technology. IAEA technical activities began in 1958. An interim safeguards system for small nuclear reactors, put in place in 1961, was replaced in 1964 by a system covering larger installations and, over the following years, was expanded to include additional nuclear facilities. In recent years, efforts to strengthen the effectiveness and improve the efficiency of the IAEA safeguards system culminated in the approval of the Model Additional Protocol by the IAEA Board of Governors in May 1997.\n\nWithin the framework of the United Nations, the principle of nuclear non-proliferation was addressed in negotiations as early as 1957. The NPT process was launched by [[Frank Aiken]], Irish Minister for External Affairs, in 1958. The NPT gained significant momentum in the early 1960s. The structure of a treaty to uphold nuclear non-proliferation as a norm of international behaviour had become clear by the mid-1960s, and by 1968 final agreement had been reached on a Treaty that would prevent the proliferation of nuclear weapons, enable cooperation for the peaceful use of nuclear energy, and further the goal of achieving nuclear disarmament. It was opened for signature in 1968, with Finland the first [[List of parties to the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty|State to sign]]. Accession became nearly universal after the end of the [[Cold War]] and of South African [[apartheid]]. In 1992, The People's Republic of China and France acceded to the NPT, the last of the five nuclear powers recognized by the treaty to do so.\n\nThe treaty provided, in article X, for a conference to be convened 25 years after its entry into force to decide whether the treaty should continue in force indefinitely, or be extended for an additional fixed period or periods. Accordingly, at the NPT Review and Extension Conference in May 1995, state parties to the treaty agreed-without a vote-on the treaty's indefinite extension, and decided that review conferences should continue to be held every five years. After Brazil acceded to the NPT in 1998, the only remaining non-nuclear-weapon state which had not signed was Cuba, which joined the NPT (and the [[Treaty of Tlatelolco]] [[NWFZ]]) in 2002.\n\nSeveral NPT states parties have given up nuclear weapons or nuclear weapons programs. South Africa undertook a nuclear weapons program, but has since renounced it and acceded to the treaty in 1991 after destroying its small nuclear [[arsenal]]; after this, the remaining African countries signed the treaty. The [[former Soviet Republics]] where nuclear weapons had been based, namely Ukraine, Belarus and Kazakhstan, transferred those weapons to Russia and joined the NPT by 1994 following the signature of the [[Budapest Memorandum on Security Assurances]].{{citation needed|date=March 2014}}\n\nSuccessor states from the breakups of Yugoslavia and Czechoslovakia also joined the treaty soon after their independence. Montenegro and East Timor were the last countries to accede to the treaty on their independence in 2006 and 2003; the only other country to accede in the 21st century was Cuba in 2002. The three Micronesian countries in [[Compact of Free Association]] with the USA joined the NPT in 1995, along with Vanuatu.\n\nMajor South American countries Argentina, Chile, and Brazil joined in 1995 and 1998. Arabian Peninsula countries included Saudi Arabia and Bahrain in 1988, Qatar and Kuwait in 1989, UAE in 1995, and Oman in 1997. The European states of [[Monaco]] and [[Andorra]] joined in 1995\u20136. Also acceding in the 1990s were Myanmar in 1992 and Guyana in 1993.\n\n===United States\u2013NATO nuclear weapons sharing===\n{{Main|Nuclear sharing}}\n[[File:nwfz.svg|thumb|upright=1.6|\n{{legend0|#0000FF|[[Nuclear-Weapon-Free Zone]]s}}<br/>\n{{legend0|#FF0000|[[Nuclear weapons states]]}}<br/>\n{{legend0|#FF8800|[[Nuclear sharing]]}}<br/>\n{{legend0|#dddd00|Neither, but NPT}} ]]\n\nAt the time the treaty was being negotiated, [[NATO]] had in place secret [[Nuclear sharing|nuclear weapons sharing]] agreements whereby the United States provided nuclear weapons to be deployed by, and stored in, other NATO states.

The reactor's components had likely been designed and manufactured in North Korea, with the reactor's striking similarity in shape and size to the North Korean Yongbyon Nuclear Scientific Research Center. That information alarmed Israeli military and intelligence to such a degree that the idea of a targeted airstrike was conceived. It resulted in [[Operation Orchard]], that took place on 6 September 2007  and saw as many as eight Israeli aircraft taking part. The Israeli government is said to have bounced the idea of the operation off of the US Bush administration, although the latter declined to participate. The nuclear reactor was destroyed in the attack, which also killed about ten North Korean workers. The attack did not cause an international outcry or any serious Syrian retaliatory moves as both parties tried to keep it secret: Despite a half-century state of war declared by surrounding states Israel didn't want publicity as regards its breach of the ceasefire while Syria wasn't willing to acknowledge its clandestine nuclear program.{{citation needed|date=October 2016}}\n\n==Leaving the treaty==\nArticle X allows a state to leave the treaty if \"extraordinary events, related to the subject matter of this Treaty, have jeopardized the supreme interests of its country\", giving three months' (ninety days') notice. The state is required to give reasons for leaving the NPT in this notice.\n\n[[NATO]] states argue that when there is a state of \"general war\" the treaty no longer applies, effectively allowing the states involved to leave the treaty with no notice. This is a necessary argument to support the NATO [[nuclear weapons sharing]] policy, but a troubling one for the logic of the treaty. NATO's argument is based on the phrase \"the consequent need to make every effort to avert the danger of such a war\" in the treaty preamble, inserted at the behest of U.S. diplomats, arguing that the treaty would at that point have failed to fulfill its function of prohibiting a general war and thus no longer be binding.<ref name=\"is_it_legal\"/> Many states do not accept this argument.{{who|date=April 2018}} See [[Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty#United States\u2013NATO nuclear weapons sharing|United States\u2013NATO nuclear weapons sharing]] above.\n\nNorth Korea has also caused an uproar by its use of this provision of the treaty. Article X.1 only requires a state to give three months' notice in total, and does not provide for other states to question a state's interpretation of \"supreme interests of its country\". In 1993, North Korea gave notice to withdraw from the NPT. However, after 89 days, North Korea reached agreement with the United States to freeze its nuclear program under the [[Agreed Framework]] and \"suspended\" its withdrawal notice. In October 2002, the United States accused North Korea of violating the Agreed Framework by pursuing a secret uranium enrichment program, and suspended shipments of heavy fuel oil under that agreement. In response, North Korea expelled IAEA inspectors, disabled IAEA equipment, and, on 10 January 2003, announced that it was ending the suspension of its previous NPT withdrawal notification. North Korea said that only one more day's notice was sufficient for withdrawal from the NPT, as it had given 89 days before.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.nti.org/e_research/profiles/NK/Nuclear/index.html |title=North Korea Profile \u2013 Nuclear Overview |publisher=Nti.org |accessdate=25 November 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110922050752/http://www.nti.org/e_research/profiles/NK/Nuclear/index.html |archive-date=22 September 2011 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\nThe IAEA Board of Governors rejected this interpretation.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.iaea.org/NewsCenter/MediaAdvisory/2003/med-advise_048.shtml |title=Media Advisory 2003/48 \u2013 IAEA Board of Governors Adopts Resolution on Safeguards in North Korea \u2013 12 February |publisher=Iaea.org |date= 11 February 2003|accessdate=25 November 2010}}</ref> Most countries held that a new three-months withdrawal notice was required, and some questioned whether North Korea's notification met the \"extraordinary events\" and \"supreme interests\" requirements of the treaty.
