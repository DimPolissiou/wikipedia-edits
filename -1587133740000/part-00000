Compressed [[oxygen]] (approx. 21% of air) would not asphyxiate, but is not used in pneumatically-powered devices because it is a fire hazard, more expensive, and offers no performance advantage over air.\n\nPortable pneumatic tools and small vehicles, such as [[Robot Wars (TV series)|Robot Wars]] machines and other hobbyist applications are often powered by compressed [[carbon dioxide]], because containers designed to hold it such as [[soda stream]] canisters and fire extinguishers are readily available, and the [[Carbon dioxide#Uses|phase change]] between liquid and gas makes it possible to obtain a larger volume of compressed gas from a lighter container than compressed air requires. Carbon dioxide is an asphyxiant and can be a freezing hazard if vented improperly.\n\n==History==\nThe origins of pneumatics can be traced back to the first century when ancient Greek mathematician [[Hero of Alexandria]] wrote about his inventions powered by steam or the wind.\n\nGerman physicist [[Otto von Guericke]] (1602 to 1686) went a little further. He invented the vacuum pump, a device that can draw out air or gas from the attached vessel. He demonstrated the vacuum pump to separate the pairs of copper hemispheres using air pressures. The field of pneumatics has changed considerably over the years. It has moved from small handheld devices to large machines with multiple parts that serve different functions.\n\n==Comparison to hydraulics==\nBoth pneumatics and [[hydraulics]] are applications of [[fluid power]]. Pneumatics uses an easily compressible gas such as air or a suitable pure gas\u2014while hydraulics uses relatively incompressible liquid media such as oil. Most industrial pneumatic applications use pressures of about {{Convert|80|to|100|psi|kPa|lk=on}}. Hydraulics applications commonly use from {{Convert|1000|to|5000|psi|MPa|abbr=on}}, but specialized applications may exceed {{Convert|10000|psi|MPa|abbr=on}}. {{Citation needed|date=November 2013}}\n\n===Advantages of pneumatics===\n*''Simplicity of design and control''\u2014Machines are easily designed using standard cylinders and other components, and operate via simple on-ofntrol.\n*''Reliability''\u2014Pneumatic systems generally have long operating lives and require little maintenance. Because gas is compressible, equipment is less subject to shock damage. Gas absorbs excessive force, whereas fluid in hydraulics directly transfers force. Compressed gas can be stored, so machines still run for a while if electrical power is lost.\n*''Safety''\u2014There is a very low chance of fire compared to hydraulic oil. New machines are usually overload safe to a certain limit.\n\n===Advantages of hydraulics===\n* Liquid does not absorb any of the supplied energy.\n* Capable of moving much higher loads and providing much higher forces due to the incompressibility.\n* The hydraulic working fluid is basically incompressible, leading to a minimum of [[Spring (device)|spring]] action. When [[hydraulic fluid]] flow is stopped, the slightest motion of the load releases the pressure on the load; there is no need to \"bleed off\" pressurized air to release the pressure on the load.\n* Highly responsive compared to pneumatics.\n* Supply more power than pneumatics.\n* Can also do many purposes at one time: lubrication, cooling and power transmission.\n\n==Pneumatic logic==\n{{further|Pneumatic circuit}}\nPneumatic logic systems (sometimes called '''air logic control''') are sometimes used for controlling industrial processes, consisting of primary logic units like:\n\n*[[Logical conjunction|And]] Units\n*[[Logical disjunction|Or]] Units\n*'Relay or Booster' Units\n*Latching Units\n*'Timer' Units\n* [[Fluidics]] amplifiers with no moving parts other than the air itself\n\nPneumatic logic is a reliable and functional control method for industrial processes.

He used the proceeds to move to the industrial hub of [[Shenzhen]] and hired a small staff in 2006. The company struggled at first, with a high degree of [[Churn rate#Employee turnover|churn]] among employees that has been attributed to Wang's abrasive personality and perfectionist expectations of his employees.

DJI began to cater more to drone hobbyists in markets outside of China. In 2011, Wang met Colin Guinn at a trade show, and the two of them would found DJI North America, a subsidiary company focusing on mass market drone sales. In 2013, DJI released the first model of the [[Phantom (UAV)|Phantom]] drone, an entry-level drone which was significantly more user-friendly than any other drone on the market at the time. The Phantom was a worldwide commercial success, but this success led to conflict between Guinn and Wang. Midway through the year, Wang made an offer to buy Guinn out, which Guinn refused. By the end of the year, DJI had locked all employees of the North American subsidiary out of their email accounts and was well on its way to shutting down the subsidiary's operations. Guinn sued DJI, and the case was settled out of court.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nIn 2015, DJI eclipsed the success of the Phantom with the release of the Phantom 3, whose even greater popularity was in

He used the proceeds to move to the industrial hub of [[Shenzhen]] and hired a small staff in 2006. The company struggled at first, with a high degree of [[Churn rate#Employee turnover|churn]] among employees that has been attributed to Wang's abrasive personality and perfectionist expectations of his employees.

DJI began to cater more to drone hobbyists in markets outside of China. In 2011, Wang met Colin Guinn at a trade show, and the two of them would found DJI North America, a subsidiary company focusing on mass market drone sales. In 2013, DJI released the first model of the [[Phantom (UAV)|Phantom]] drone, an entry-level drone which was significantly more user-friendly than any other drone on the market at the time. The Phantom was a worldwide commercial success, but this success led to conflict between Guinn and Wang. Midway through the year, Wang made an offer to buy Guinn out, which Guinn refused. By the end of the year, DJI had locked all employees of the North American subsidiary out of their email accounts and was well on its way to shutting down the subsidiary's operations. Guinn sued DJI, and the case was settled out of court.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nIn 2015, DJI eclipsed the success of the Phantom with the release of the Phantom 3, whose even greater popularity was in

This drone is DJI's cheapest to date and features a 12-megapixel camera capable of shooting 1080p video at 30fps. The camera is stabilised mechanically by a 2-axis gimbal. The Spark also carries an advanced infrared 3D camera that helps the drone to detect obstacles in front of it, as well as facilitating hand-gesture control\u2014a feature that was, until the release of the Mavic Air in January 2018, unique to the Spark. In addition to a smartphone app with virtual controller, a physical controller can also be bought, extending the drone's range up to 1.2 miles (2&nbsp;km).
