After the heat source is shut off, the cream is skimmed and left to chill (and mildly [[fermentation (food)|ferment]]) for several hours or days. Kaymak has a high percentage of [[milk fat]], typically about 60%. It has a thick, creamy consistency (not entirely compact, because of milk protein fibers) and a rich taste.\n\n==Etymology==\nThe word kaymak has [[Central Asia]]n [[Turkic languages|Turkic]] origins, possibly formed from the verb kaymak, which means melt and molding of metal in [[Turkic languages|Turkic]].<ref name=\"nisanyansozluk.com\">{{cite web|url=http://www.nisanyansozluk.com/?k=kaymak|title=kaymak|publisher=Ni\u015fanyanS\u00f6zl\u00fck|language=Turkish|accessdate=13 July 2017}}</ref> The first written records of the word kaymak is in the well-known book of [[Mahmud al-Kashgari]], ''[[D\u012bw\u0101n Lugh\u0101t al-Turk]]''.

Kaymak is mainly consumed today for breakfast along with the traditional [[Turkish breakfast]]. One type of kaymak is found in the [[Afyonkarahisar]] region where the water buffalo are fed from the residue of poppy seeds pressed for oil. Kaymak can also describe the creamy foam in the traditional \"black\" Turkish coffee.

After the heat source is shut off, the cream is skimmed and left to chill (and mildly [[fermentation (food)|ferment]]) for several hours or days. Kaymak has a high percentage of [[milk fat]], typically about 60%.

Prophetic medical traditions exhort humans to not simply stop at following Muhammad's teachings, but encourage them to search for cures as well. The literature of prophetic medicine thus occupies a symbolic role in the elucidation of Islamic identity as constituted by a particular set of relationships to science, medicine, technology and nature. There has historically been a tension in the understanding of the medical narratives: are they of the same nature as Muhammad\u2019s religious pronouncements, or are they time-sensitive, culturally situated, and thus not representative of a set of eternal medical truths? <ref name = \"Ragab\">{{cite journal | last1 = Ragab | first1 = Ahmed | year = 2012 | title = Prophetic Traditions and Modern Medicine in the Middle East: Resurrection, Reinterpretation, and Reconstruction| doi = 10.7817/jameroriesoci.132.4.0657 | journal = Journal of the American Oriental Society | volume = 132 | issue = 4| pages = 657\u2013673 }}</ref> This body of knowledge was fully articulated only in the 14th century, at which point it was concerned with reconciling ''[[Sunnah]]'' (traditions) with the foundations of the [[Galen]]ic [[Humorism|humoral theory]] that was prevalent at the time in the medical institutions of the [[wiktionary:Islamicate|Islamicate]] world.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Stearns|first=Justin|title=Writing the History of the Natural Sciences in the Pre-modern Muslim World: Historiography, Religion, and the Importance of the Early Modern Period|journal=History Compass|date=1 December 2011 | volume=9 | issue=12 | pages=923\u2013951 |doi=10.1111/j.1478-0542.2011.00810.x}}</ref> It is nonetheless a tradition with  continued modern-day currency.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.tibbenabawi.org/ |title=:: Tibb-e-Nabawi, Healing by ISLAM |website=Tibbenabawi.org |date= |accessdate=2016-01-08}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.prophetic-medicine.com/ |title=Lifestyle & Wellbeing According to the Quran & Sunna |publisher=Prophetic Medicine |date= |accessdate=2016-01-08}}</ref>\n\n==Overview==\nProphetic medicine is sometimes casually identified with ''[[Unani]]'' medicine or [[traditional medicine]], although it is distinguished from some iterations of these and from [[scientific medicine]] most predominantly by the former being specifically a collection of advice attributed to Muhammad in the Islamic tradition.<ref>{{cite book|last=Rosenthal|first=Franz|title=The classical heritage in Islam|year=1975|publisher=University of California Press|location=Berkeley|isbn=0-520-01997-0|author2=Marmorstein, Jenny |page=182}}</ref> One would do well to note that medieval interpretations of the medical hadith were produced in a Galenic medical context, while modern-day editions might bring in recent research findings to frame the importance of the genre.
