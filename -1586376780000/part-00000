He was particularly associated with the campaigns for land reform in Ireland during the late 19th and early 20th centuries as well as his conciliatory approach to attaining [[Irish Home Rule Bill|Irish Home Rule]].\n\n==Family, education==\n[[File:William O'Brien birthplace plaque, Mallow, co Cork, Ireland.JPG|right|thumb|Birthplace plaque, Thomas Davis Street, Mallow, Co Cork]]\nWilliam O'Brien was born at Bank Place in [[Mallow, County Cork]], as second son of James O'Brien, a solicitor's clerk, and his wife Kate, the daughter of James Nagle, a local shopkeeper. On his mother's side he was descended from the distinguished [[Normans|Norman]] family of Nagles, long settled in the vicinity of Mallow giving their name to the nearby Nagle Mountains.  He was also linked through his mother with the statesman [[Edmund Burke]]'s mother's family, as well as with the poet [[Edmund Spenser]]'s family.\nThe Nagles however, no longer held the status or prosperity they once had. In the same month thirty-eight years earlier [[Thomas Osborne Davis (Irish politician)|Thomas Davis]] was born in Mallow. O'Brien's advocacy of the cause of Irish Independence was to be in the same true tradition of his esteemed fellow-townsman. Following in his footsteps he acknowledged the existence of many strands of Irishness.{{sfn|O'Donovan|2014|p=141|loc=Ch. 7}}\n\nO'Brien shared his primary education with a townsman with whom he was later to have a close political connection, [[Canon Sheehan|Canon Sheehan of Doneraile]]. He enjoyed his secondary education at the Cloyne diocesan college, which resulted in his being brought up in an environment noted for its religious tolerance. He greatly valued having had this experience from an early age, which strongly influenced his later views for the need of such tolerance in Irish national life.\n\n==Early journalism==\nFinancial misfortune in 1868 caused the O'Brien family to move to [[Cork (city)|Cork City]]. A year later his father died, and the illness of his elder and younger brother and his sister resulted in him having to support his mother and siblings. Always a prolific writer, it quickly earned him a job as newspaper reporter, first for the ''Cork Daily Herald''. This was to be the primary career which first attracted attention to him as a public figure. He had begun legal studies at Queen's College, later [[University College Cork]], but although he never graduated, he held a lifelong attachment to the institution, to which he bequeathed his private papers.\n\n==Political origins==\nFrom an early age O'Brien's political ideas, like most of his contemporaries, were shaped by the [[Fenian]] movement and the plight of the Irish tenant farmers, his elder brother having participated in the rebellion of 1867. It resulted in O'Brien himself becoming actively involved with the Fenian brotherhood, resigning in the mid-1870s, because of what he described in 'Evening Memories' (p.&nbsp;443\u20134) as \"the gloom of inevitable failure and horrible punishment inseparable from any attempt at separation by force of arms\".\n\nAs a journalist his attention was attracted in the first place to the suffering of the tenant farmers. Now on the staff of the ''Freeman's Journal'', after touring the [[Galtee Mountains]] around Christmas 1877 he published articles describing their conditions, which later appeared in pamphlet form. With this action he first displayed his belief that only through parliamentary reform and with the new power of the press that public opinion could be influenced to pursue Irish issues constitutionally through open political activity and the ballot box. Not least of all, responding to the hopes of the new [[Irish Home Rule]] movement.\n\n==United Ireland Editor==\n[[Image:Irish land war.jpg|thumb|right|Land War manifesto]]\nIn 1878 he met [[Charles Stewart Parnell]] MP at a Home Rule meeting. Parnell recognised his exceptional talents as a journalist and writer, influencing his rise to becoming a leading politician of the new generation. He subsequently appointed him in 1881 as editor of the [[Irish National Land League]]'s journal, ''United Ireland''. His association with Parnell and the [[Irish Parliamentary Party]] (IPP) led to his arrest and imprisonment with Parnell, Dillon, [[William Hoey Kearney Redmond|William Redmond]] and other nationalist leaders in [[Kilmainham Gaol]] that October.\n\nDuring his imprisonment until April 1882 he drafted the famous Land War ''[[No Rent Manifesto]]'' \u2013 a rent-withholding scheme personally led by O'Brien, escalating the conflict between the [[Irish National Land League|Land League]] and [[William Ewart Gladstone|Gladstone]]'s government.\n\n==Agitator and MP==\nFrom 1883\u20131885 O'Brien was elected MP for [[Mallow (UK Parliament constituency)|Mallow]]. Following the abolition of that constituency he represented [[Tyrone South (UK Parliament constituency)|Tyrone South]] from 1885 to 1886,  [[North East Cork (UK Parliament constituency)|North East Cork]] from 1887\u20131892, and [[Cork City (UK Parliament constituency)|Cork City]] from 1892\u20131895 and from 1901\u20131918, in the House of Commons. There were three periods of absence: 1886\u20137, from 1895\u20131900, and eight months in 1904.  Amid the turmoil of Irish politics in the late 19th century he was frequently arrested and imprisoned for his support for various Land League protests.\n\nIn 1884, through the newspaper ''United Ireland'' he incited a sensational homosexual scandal involving officers at [[Dublin Castle]].{{sfn|Costello|1999|p=77}}\n\nIn 1887 O'Brien helped to organise a [[rent strike]] during the [[Plan of Campaign]] at the estate of Lady Kingston near [[Mitchelstown, Ireland|Mitchelstown, County Cork]]. On 9 September, after an 8,000-strong demonstration led by [[John Dillon]] MP, three estate tenants were shot dead, and others wounded, by police at the town's courthouse where O'Brien had been brought for trial on charges of incitement under a new [[Irish Coercion Bill|Coercion Act]]. This event became known as the [[Mitchelstown#Mitchelstown Massacre|Mitchelstown Massacre]]. Later that year, thousands of demonstrators marched in London to demand his release from prison, and clashed with police at [[Trafalgar Square]] on [[Bloody Sunday (1887)|Bloody Sunday]] (13 November).\n[[Image:1887BloodySunday.jpg|thumb|left|Bloody Sunday (1887)]]\n\nEven in prison, O'Brien continued his protests, refusing to wear prison uniform in 1887. Being left without clothes, a [[Blarney]] tweed suit was smuggled in. He occasionally wore this much publicised suit in the Commons when confronting his incarcerator, [[Arthur Balfour]]. His imprisonment also inspired protests \u2013 notably the 1887 '[[Bloody Sunday 1887|Bloody Sunday]]' riots in London. In 1889 he escaped from a courtroom but was sentenced ''in absentia'' for conspiracy. He fled to America accompanied by Dillon who was on bail, then to France where both held negotiations with Parnell at [[Boulogne-sur-Mer]] over the leadership of the party. When these broke down, both returned to [[Folkestone]] giving themselves up, subsequently serving four months in [[Clonmel]] and [[Galway]] gaols. Here O'Brien began to reconsider his political future, having already been prosecuted nine times over years, using the time to write an acclaimed novel, a [[Fenian]] romance with a land reform theme set in 1860: ''When We Were Boys'',  which was published in 1890.\n\n==Marriage, reorientation==\nIn 1890 he married [[Sophie Raffalovich]], sister of the poet [[Marc-Andr\u00e9 Raffalovich|Marc Andr\u00e9 Sebastian Raffalovich]] and the economist [[Arthur Raffalovich]],<ref name=\"Taranaki Herald\" /> and daughter of the Russian Jewish banker, Hermann Raffalowich, domiciled in Paris. It was to mark a major turning point in O'Brien's personal and political life. His wife brought considerable wealth into the marriage, enabling him to act with political independence and providing finances to establish his own newspapers. His wife (1860\u20131960) who survived him by over 30 years, gave him considerable moral and emotional support for his political pursuits. Their relationship added an abiding love for France and attachment to Europe to his life, where he often retired to recuperate.\n\nBy 1891 he had become disillusioned with Parnell's political leadership, although emotionally loyal to him he tried to persuade him to retire after the [[Katherine O'Shea|O'Shea]] divorce case. On Parnell's death that year and the ensuing IPP split, he remained aloof from aligning himself with either side of the Party, either the rump pro-Parnellite [[Irish National League]] (INL) led by [[John Redmond]] MP or with the anti-Parnellite [[Irish National Federation]] (INF) group under [[John Dillon]], although he saw the weight of strength in the latter. O'Brien worked hard in the 1893 negotiations leading to the Commons passing Gladstone's [[Second Irish Home Rule Bill|Second Home Rule Bill]], which the Lords however rejected. ([[s:Irish Home Rule Speech|Gladstone's speech]] on the [[First Irish Home Rule Bill|First Home Rule Bill]] had beseeched parliament not to reject it).\n\n==United Irish League==\nDistancing himself from the party turmoils, he retired from parliament in 1895, settling for a while with his wife near [[Westport, County Mayo]], which enabled him to experience at first hand from his Mayo retreat the distressed hardship of the peasantry in the West of Ireland, trying to eke out an existence in its rocky landscape.\n\nBelieving strongly that agitational politics combined with constitutional pressures were the best means of achieving objectives, O'Brien established on the 16. January 1898 the [[United Irish League]] (UIL) at Westport, with [[Michael Davitt]] as co-founder and [[John Dillon]] present. It was to be a new grass-roots organisation with a programme to include agrarian agitation, political reform and Home Rule. It coincided with the passing of the revolutionary [[Local Government (Ireland) Act 1898]] which broke the power of the landlord dominated \"Grand Juries\", passing for the first time absolute democratic control of local affairs into the hands of the people through elected Local County Councils.\n\nThe UIL was explicitly designed to reconcile the various parliamentary fragments existing since the Parnell split, which proved very popular, its branches sweeping over most of the country organised by its general secretary [[John O'Donnell (Irish politician)|John O'Donnell]], dictating to the demoralised Irish party leaders the terms for reconstruction, not only of the party but the nationalist movement in Ireland. The movement was backed by O'Brien's new newspaper ''[[The Irish People (Cork newspaper)|The Irish People]]''.\n\nAround 1900 O'Brien, an unbending social reformer and agrarian agitator, was the most influential and powerful figure within the nationalist movement, although not formally its leader. His UIL was by far the largest organisation in the country, comprising 1150 branches and 84,355 members. The result of the rapid growth of his UIL as a national organisation in achieving unity through organised popular opinion, was to effect a quick defensive reunion of the discredited IPP factions of the [[Irish National League|INL]] and the [[Irish National Federation|INF]], largely fearing O\u2019Brien's return to the political field. He can nevertheless be regarded as the architect of the settlement of 1900.{{sfn|Jackson|2003|p=103}} The unity under [[John Redmond]] disturbed O\u2019Brien, as it resulted in most of the ineffective party candidates being re-elected in the [[1900 United Kingdom general election|1900 general election]], preventing the UIL from using its power in the pre-selection of candidates. Within a few years the IPP was however, to tactically adjunct the UIL under its wing manoeuvering it out of O'Brien's control.\n\n==Land Act architect==\nO'Brien next intensified the UIL agitation for land purchase by tenant farmers, pressurising for compulsory purchase. He formed an alliance with constructive unionists{{sfn|Potter|2011|p=208}} which resulted in the calling of the December 1902 [[Land Conference]], an initiative by moderate landlords led by [[Windham Wyndham-Quin, 4th Earl of Dunraven and Mount-Earl#Government|Lord Dunraven]] for a settlement by conciliatory agreement between landlord and tenant. The tenant representation was led by O'Brien, the others were John Redmond, [[Timothy Harrington]] and [[Sir Thomas Russell, 1st Baronet|T. W. Russell]] for the Ulster tenants.{{sfn|Miller|1973|pp=86-87}} After six sittings all eight tenant's demands were conceded (one with compromise),{{sfn|Sheehan|1921|p=99}} O\u2019Brien having guided the official nationalist movement into endorsement of a new policy of '''''\"conference plus business\"'''''. He followed this by campaigning vigorously for the greatest piece of social legislation Ireland had yet seen, orchestrating the [[George Wyndham|Wyndham]] ''[[Irish Land Acts#Wyndham Land (Purchase) Act 1903|Land Purchase Act (1903)]]'' through parliament, {{sfn|King|2009|pp=68-69}} which effectively ended [[Absentee landlord|landlordism]],  solving the age old [[Irish Land Acts|Irish Land Question]].\n\nThis masterful strategy of bringing about agreement on land purchase between tenants and landlords under the Act, resulted in a rush of landlords to sell and of tenants to buy.{{sfn|Lyons|1968|p=235|loc= Ch. 8 ''Estrangements''}} Though the Act was approved by Redmond, his deputy Dillon disfavoured the Act because he opposed any co-operation with landlords and [[Michael Davitt]] objected to peasant proprietorship under the Act, demanding land nationalisation.{{sfn|Lyons|1968|pp=236-238}} Together with [[Thomas Sexton (Irish politician)|Thomas Sexton]] editor of the party's ''[[Freeman's Journal]]'', all three campaigned against O\u2019Brien, fiercely attacking him for putting Land Purchase and Conciliation before Home Rule. O'Brien appealed to Redmond to suppress their opposition but it went unheeded. Declaring that he was making no headway with his policy, he resigned his parliamentary seat in November 1903, closed down his paper the ''Irish People'' and left the party for the next five years. It was a serious setback for the party. It also turned once intimate friends into mortal enemies.{{sfn|Lyons|1968|pp=240-241 and 236}} His Cork electorate however, insisted on pushing through his re-election eight months later in August 1904. O\u2019Brien had failed in his intention of shocking the party to its senses.\n\nDuring 1904 O'Brien had already embarked on advancing full scale implementation of the Act in alliance with [[D. D. Sheehan]] MP and his [[Irish Land and Labour Association]] (ILLA), when they formed the Cork Advisory Committee to help tenants in their negotiations.{{sfn|Sheehan|1921|pp=187-188}} Their collaboration became the new organisational base for O'Brien's political activities.{{sfn|Maume|1999|p=70}} This new alliance aggravated the Dillonite section of the IPP further. Determined to destroy both of them \"before they poison the whole country\",{{sfn|O'Brien|1976|p=170}} Dillon and the party published regular denunciations in the ''Freeman's Journal'', then coup\u00e9d O'Brien's UIL with the appointment of its new secretary, Dillon's chief lieutenant, [[Joseph Devlin]] MP, [[Grand master (order)|Grandmaster]] of the [[Ancient Order of Hibernians]], Devlin eventually gaining organisational control over the entire UIL and IPP organisations.\n\nO'Brien had in the meantime engaged with the [[Irish Reform Association]], together with Sir [[Antony MacDonnell, 1st Baron MacDonnell|Anthony MacDonnell]], a Mayo Catholic originally appointed by Wyndham, and head of the Civil Service in [[Dublin Castle administration in Ireland|Dublin Castle]], anxious to do something for Ireland. MacDonnell helped the reform group{{sfn|MacDonagh|1928|p=173}} to draft a scheme on the possible extension of the principle of self-government for Ireland.{{sfn|O'Brien|1976|pp=163\u2013165}} On 31 August 1904 the Reform Association released a preliminary report calling for the devolution of larger powers of local government for Ireland. The limited scheme was quickly and equally condemned by O'Brien's opponents, who regarded it nevertheless as a step in the right direction.\n\n==Macroom programme==\nBritain had two bills to pay for past wrongs. After financing tenant land purchase, tenant farmers were now proud proprietors largely in control of local government. The next bill to pay was for extensive rural housing of the tens of thousands of migrant farm labourers struggling to survive in stone cabins, barns or mud hovels. This was a long-standing demand by the ILLA branches and D.D. Sheehan.{{sfn|O'Donovan|2013|pp= 220\u2013237|loc=Ch 13}} In 1904 O'Brien then joined forces with Sheehan's ILLA organisation,{{sfn|Maume|1999|pp=70-71}} identifying himself with labourer's grievances and Sheehan's demand for agricultural labourers' housing, who up to then were dependent on limited provision of cottages by local County Councils or landowners at unfavourable terms.\n\nFollowing demonstrations of amazing extent addressed by O\u2019Brien and his friends during 1904 which fought and won the field in [[Charleville, County Cork|Charleville]] and [[Macroom]] (counties Cork), [[Kilfinane]] and [[Dromcolliher]] (counties Limerick), [[Tralee]] and [[Castleisland]] (counties Kerry), [[Scariff]] co. Clare, [[Ardmayle|Goolds Cross]] co. Tipperary and [[Ballycullane]] co. Wexford,{{sfn|Sheehan|1921|p=184}} a breakthrough occurred when a scheme was made public at ''\"the largest labour demonstration ever held in Ireland\"'' (''[[Cork Examiner]]''), a memorable rally in Macroom on Sunday 11 December 1904 addressed by William O'Brien.{{sfn|McKay|1992|p=33}} Preaching a gospel of social justice,{{sfn|O'Donovan|2013|pp= 228|loc=Ch 13}} his concepts became known as the '''''`Macroom programme\u00b4'''''. O'Brien grasped the prime importance of its principles and measures, when during 1905 he pressed and negotiated together with support from Sir Anthony MacDonnell (the [[Under-Secretary for Ireland]]) for what was subsequently carried into law{{sfn|O'Brien|1910|p=389}} and after the January [[1900 United Kingdom general election|1906 general election]] became the unprecedented Bryce ''[[Irish Land Acts#Labourers (Ireland) Act 1906|Labourers (Ireland) Act (1906)]]''.\n\n==Housing drive==\n[[File:Labourers' Act (Ireland) Cottage.JPG|right|thumb|Labourers Act cottages]]\nThe Second Phase of the Labourers Acts (1906\u20131914) began after the 1906 Labourers Housing Act, long demanded by the ILLA, was implemented, for which both the Redmondite and O'Brienite factions were zealous in claiming credit.{{sfn|Bradley|1988|p=28|loc=Ch. 2}} The labourer-owned cottages erected by the Local County Councils brought about a major socio-economic transformation, by simultaneously erasing the previous inhuman habitations.{{sfn|Ferriter|2010|pp=62-64}} O'Brien saying that the Labourers Acts \u2013 \"were scarcely less wonderworking than the abolition of landlordism itself\". In 1904 Davitt going so far as to declare the foreseen Labourers Act constituted \u2013 \"a rational principle of state Socialism\". This Act had enormous positive long-term consequences for rural Irish society.\n\nThe so-called 'Labourers Act' provided large scale funding for extensive state sponsored housing to accommodate rural labourers and others of the working classes. The programme financed and produced during the course of the next five years, the erection of over 40,000 working-class cottages, each on an acre of land, a complete 'municipalisation' of commodious dwellings dotting the rural Irish countryside. This unique social housing programme unparalleled anywhere else in Europe brought about an unsurpassed agrarian revolution, changing the face of the Irish landscape, much to O'Brien's expressed delight.{{sfn|O'Brien|1910|p=389}}  \n \nRenewed publication of O'Brien's newspaper ''[[Cork Free Press|The Irish People]]'' (1905\u20131909) exalting the cottage building, its editorials equally countermanding the IPPs' \"Dublin bosses\" attempts to curtail the programme, fearing settled rural communities would no longer be dependent on Party and Church. Munster took full advantage, erecting most of the cottages, additional funding providing for a further 5,000 houses under [[A. Birrell|Birrell]]'s  [[s:Irish Labourers Housing Act|''Labourers (Ireland) Act 1911'']]. The bulk of the labourers' cottages were erected by 1916, resulting in a widespread decline of rampant [[tuberculosis]], [[typhoid]] and [[scarlet fever]].{{sfn|Ferriter|2010|p=159}}\n\n==Turbulent times==\nIn the interest of political unity, O'Brien and other excluded MPs temporarily rejoined the Parliamentary Party when Redmond summoned a unity meeting in the Mansion House, Dublin in April 1908.{{sfn|Sheehan|1921|pp=199\u2013206}} Later that year, during negotiations for additional funding of land purchase under an amending bill, Redmond called a further UIL National Convention for 9 February 1909 in Dublin to regulate the issues, claiming the bill over-burdened the British Treasury and the rate payers. Over 3000 delegates attended. Devlin had the hall filled in advance with forces of his [[Molly Maguires|''militant Mollies'']], so that when O'Brien and his followers tried to speak in favour of the bill, they were battoned into silence. The convention then dubbed the 'Baton' Convention by O'Brien.{{sfn|O'Brien|1976|pp=187-188}} It was ''\"probably the stormiest meeting ever held by constitutional nationalists\"''.{{sfn|Jackson|2003|p=112}}\n\nThe bill eventually passed into law as Birrell's  ''Land Purchase Act (1909)'', but falling far short in its financial provisions.\n\nAs an outcome of the \"[[All-for-Ireland League#Baton Convention|Baton Convention]]\" O\u2019Brien felt himself again driven from the party. He foresaw that the IPP, undermined by the AOH, was on a fatal radical path which would frustrate any All-Ireland Home Rule settlement. As a counter measure he set about establishing a new League, which was to build on the success his combined \"doctrine of conciliation\" with \"conference plus business\"  achieved during the 1902 Land Conference with landlords and the ensuing 1903 Land Purchase Act. Following his engagement with the [[Irish Reform Association|Irish Reform Movement]] 1904-5 and support of the 1907 [[Irish Council Bill]] which he viewed as a step in the right direction, or \"Home Rule by instalments\", he firmly believed all moderate unionists could still be won over to All-Ireland Home Rule. For many nationalists on the other hand, the adoption of a conciliatory approach to the \"hereditary enemy\" involved too sharp a deviation from traditional thinking.\n\n==All-for-Ireland League==\n[[Image:All-for-Ireland League MPs, 1910.jpg|thumb|350px|right|[[All-for-Ireland League]] group portrait of five of its Independent [[Member of Parliament#United Kingdom|Members of Parliament]], 1910. <br>These are: [[Patrick Guiney]] ([[North Cork (UK Parliament constituency)|North Cork]]), [[James Gilhooly]] ([[West Cork (UK Parliament constituency)|West Cork]]), [[Maurice Healy]] ([[North-East Cork (UK Parliament constituency)|North-east Cork]]), [[D. D. Sheehan]] ([[Mid Cork (UK Parliament constituency)|Mid Cork]]), and [[Eugene Crean]] ([[South-East Cork (UK Parliament constituency)|South-east Cork]]). <br>The other MPs elected in January 1910 were: '''William O'Brien''' ([[Cork City (UK Parliament constituency)|Cork city]]), [[John O'Donnell (Irish politician)|John O'Donnell]] ([[South Mayo (UK Parliament constituency)|South Mayo]]) and [[Timothy Michael Healy]] ([[North Louth (UK Parliament constituency)|North Louth]]).]]\n\nIn March 1909 he inaugurated the [[All-for-Ireland League]] (AFIL) in [[Kanturk]] with [[James Gilhooly]] MP as Chairman and [[D. D. Sheehan]] Hon. Secretary. The AFIL's political objective was the attainment of an All-Ireland parliament with the consent rather than by the compulsion of the [[Church of Ireland|Protestant]]  and [[Unionism in Ireland|Unionist community]], under the banner of the \"Three Cs\", for Conference, Conciliation and Consent as applied to Irish politics. The League was supported by many prominent Protestant gentry, leading landlords and Munster business figures.{{sfn|MacDonagh|1928|p=186}} The political activist [[Canon Sheehan]] of Doneraile was also a founder member and wrote in a very long editorial for the first issue of the League's new newspaper its [[All-for-Ireland League#League's manifesto|political manifesto]].\n\nIll-health striking O\u2019Brien, he departed for [[Florence]], Italy to recuperate, returning for the January [[January 1910 United Kingdom general election|1910 general election]], in which the Cork electorate returned eight \"O'Brienite\" MPs. Throughout 1910 his AFIL movement opposed an Irish Party supported by the Catholic clergy. It returned eight independent AFIL MPs in the December [[December 1910 United Kingdom general election|1910 general election]] to be O'Brien's new political party. From July 1910 until late 1916 O\u2019Brien published the League's newspaper, the ''[[Cork Free Press]]''. Election results published by it showed Independents throughout Ireland had won 30% of votes cast.\n\nO\u2019Brien saw it opportune for a co-operative understanding with [[Arthur Griffith]]'s moderate [[History of Sinn F\u00e9in|Sinn F\u00e9in movement]], having in common \u2013 attaining objectives through \"moral protest\" \u2013 political resistance and agitation rather than militant physical-force. Neither O\u2019Brien nor Griffith advocated total [[abstentionism]] from the Commons, and regarded Dominion Home Rule, modelled on Canada or Australia, as acceptable. Although Griffith favoured co-operation, a special Sinn Fe\u00edn executive council meeting called to consider co-operation regretted it was not possible because its constitution would not allow it.{{sfn|O'Brien|1976|p=193|loc=Ch. 8}} In the following years O\u2019Brien and his party continued to associate themselves with Griffith's movement both in and out of parliament. In June 1918 Griffith asked O\u2019Brien to have the writ moved for his candidacy in the [[East Cavan (UK Parliament constituency)|Cavan-east]] by-election (moved by AFIL MP [[Eugene Crean]]) to which Griffith was elected with a sizeable majority.{{sfn|Maume|1999|p=207|loc=note 322}}\n\n==Home Rule stance==\nOn 2 November 1911 O'Brien proposed full Dominion status similar to that enjoyed by Canada, in an exchange of views with [[H. H. Asquith|Asquith]],{{sfn|O'Donovan|2014|p=145|loc=Ch. 7}} as the only viable solution to the \"Irish Question\". Home Rule became technically assured after a new Home Rule bill was introduced in 1912 with the IPP holding the balance of power at [[Palace of Westminster|Westminster]]. During the 1913\u201314 parliamentary debates on the [[Third Home Rule Act|Third Home Rule Bill]], O'Brien, alarmed by [[Unionist (Ireland)|Unionist]] resistance to the bill, opposed the IPP's coercive \"Ulster must follow\" policy, and published in the ''Cork Free Press'' end of January 1914 specific concession, including a suspensory veto right,<ref name=\"The Times 1914\" /> which would enable Ulster join a Dublin Parliament \"any price for an United Ireland, but never partition\". William O'Brien resigned his seat as MP again for a fourth time in January and re-stood to test local support for his policies, after the All-for-Ireland League suffered heavy defeats in the Cork City municipal elections.\n\nAfter the opening of parliament in February 1914 the threat of rebellion in Ulster gave O'Brien the opportunity to make an eloquent speech on the 24 February calling for generous concessions towards Ulster, but warning he would 'strenuously oppose exclusion'.{{sfn|O'Donovan|2014|p=157|loc=Ch. 7}} When the [[Ulster Volunteers]] armed in April to resist likely \"[[Rome Rule]]\", Redmond's [[Irish Volunteers]] armed likewise to ensure enactment of all-Ireland self-government. During the final stages of the second reading and debate on the Third [[Home Rule Act 1914|Home Rule Bill]] in the House of Commons, which was accompanied by Asquith's guarantee that it would never be enforced without an Amending Bill enacting the exclusion of the [[History of Northern Ireland|six Ulster counties]] with a Protestant majority, O'Brien made a powerful lengthy speech<ref name=\"Hansard1914-04-01\" /> on 1 April 1914 reiterating at length his proposals to enable Ulster remain within an All-Ireland settlement, by means of a suspensory veto upon any bill passed by a Dublin Parliament, amongst other rights and protections. Stating \"I condemn and abhor with all my heart the preparations of the Ulster Volunteers for even the possibility of slaughter between Irishmen and Irishmen\". Otherwise Ireland once divided would remain divided and 'the line on which you are presently travelling will never bring you anything except division and disaster'.\n\nOpposing O'Brien's proposals and initiatives, the Redmond-Dillon-Devlin (IPP-UIL-AOH) hardline alliance remained uncompromising with their standpoint \u2013 \"no concessions for Ulster\". In the Commons on 25 May O'Brien stated that \"we are ready for almost any conceivable concession to Ulster that will have the effect of uniting Ireland, but we will struggle to our last breath against a proposal which will divide her, and divide her eternally, if Ireland's own representatives are once consenting parties . . .\" after which he and his followers holding true to their pledge, abstained from the final vote passing the [[Home Rule Act 1914]], denouncing the bill as a \"ghastly farce\"{{sfn|O'Donovan|2014|pp=158-159|loc=Ch. 7}} ultimately as a \"partition deal\" after Sir [[Edward Carson]] leader of the [[Ulster Unionist Party]] forced through an amendment mandating the [[partition of Ireland]], the Irish Nationalists' confrontation course with Ulster ending in fiasco.\n\nWith the outbreak of [[World War I]] on 4 August 1914, Asquith proposed a [[Suspensory Act 1914|Suspensory Bill]] for the Home Rule Bill. It received [[Royal Assent]] simultaneously with its counterpart, the Government of Ireland Act 1914, on the 18 September. Although the two controversial Bills had now finally reached the statute books, the Suspensory Act ensured that Home Rule would be postponed for the duration of the conflict.{{sfn|Jackson|2003|p=164}} In the debate on 15 September in the House of Commons concerning the Suspensory Bill, O'Brien made it again clear ''\"that while we are prepared to pay almost any other price for a general national settlement, there is one price which some of us, at all events, will never in any possible circumstances consent to pay, and that is the dismemberment of our ancient Irish nation\"''. He concluded by turning to 'our fellow countrymen in Ulster' in proposing to secure for them a position of undiminished citizenship in this Empire under some projected scheme of federalism.<ref name=\"Hansard1914-09-15\" />\n\n==Last crusade==\nO'Brien saw the outbreak of World War I in August as an opportunity to undertake a last crusade to preserve at any price the unity of Ireland, by uniting the Green and Orange in a common cause,  declaring himself on the side of [[Allies of World War I|the Allied]] and Britain's European war effort. O'Brien was the first Nationalist leader to call on [[National Volunteers|Irish Volunteers]] for the front. Towards the end of August he had an interview with [[Horatio Kitchener, 1st Earl Kitchener|Lord Kitchener]], Secretary of State for War, and laid before him a scheme for raising an [[16th (Irish) Division|Irish Army Corps]] embracing all classes and creeds, South and North. Kitchener (incidentally a Protestant and born in [[County Kerry]]) favoured the idea.{{sfn|MacDonagh|1928|p=200}}  O\u2019Brien immediately summoned a meeting held in the [[Cork (city)|Cork]] Town Hall under the auspices of the All-for-Ireland League on 2 September, the hall packed with an enthusiastic audience of men and women. In a speech that far exceeded Redmond's in favour of its adherence to England cause, he said:- :{{cquote|''We are taking to-night \u2013 I don\u2019t conceal it from myself \u2013 one of the most momentous decisions in our history. If we make up our minds, for heaven's sake let there be no half-heartedness, let there be no qualifications or reservations. We have got to be honest friends or honest enemies of England. It won\u2019t do merely to say that we are willing to fight for Belgium, or to fight for Ireland, or to fight for France, much though we love those gallant nations (cheers). We have got to go further and to say, without putting a tooth in it, that we are ready to fight for England as well, in England's way (cheers). And in fighting England's battle in the particular circumstance of this war, I am convinced to the heart's core that we are fighting the most effective battle in all the ages for Ireland's liberty (cheers) as well as to save our towns and our homes and our women and children from the grip of the most appalling horde of brutes in human shape that ever cursed this earth since [[Atilla]] met his doom at the hands of eternal justice (cheers).''{{sfn|MacDonagh|1928|pp=200-201}}}}\n\nO'Brien later wrote: \"Whether Home Rule is to have a future will depend upon the extent to which the [[National Volunteers|Nationalists]] in combination with [[Ulster Volunteers|Ulster Covenanters]], do their part in the firing line on the [[Western Front (World War I)|fields of France]]\".{{sfn|O'Brien|1976|p=215}} He stood on recruiting platforms with the other National leaders and spoke out encouragingly in favour of voluntary enlistment in the [[Royal Munster Fusiliers]] and other [[Irish regiment]]s.\n\n==Changing tides==\nO'Brien, alarmed at the increased activity of Sinn F\u00e9in in 1915, predicted the danger of a potential republican eruption, culminating in the IRB [[Easter Rising|1916 Rebellion]], in which however Sinn F\u00e9in were not involved. He was forced to cease publication of his ''Cork Free Press'' in 1916 soon after the appointment of [[John Beresford, 5th Baron Decies|Lord Decies]] as Chief Press Censor for Ireland. Decies warned the press to be careful about what they published. Such warnings had little effect when dealing with such papers as the ''Cork Free Press''. It was suppressed after its republican editor, [[Frank Gallagher (author)|Frank Gallagher]], accused the British authorities of lying about the conditions and situation of republican prisoners in the [[Frongoch internment camp]].{{sfn|Martin|2006|p=9|loc=Introduction}}\n\n[[File:Ireland's National Pledge, April 1918.jpg|right|thumb|Ireland's Anti-Conscription Pledge, 1918]]\nO'Brien accepted the Rising and the ensuing changed political climate in 1917 as the best way of ridding the country of IPP and AOH stagnation. Home Rule had been lost in 1913, an inflexible IPP long out of touch with reality, reflected by Britain's two failed attempts to introduce Home Rule in 1916 and again in 1917. O'Brien refused to participate in the [[Irish Convention]] after [[Irish Unionist Party|southern unionist]] representatives he had proposed were turned down.{{sfn|MacDonagh|1928|p=231|loc=Introduction}} During the Convention Redmond belatedly adopted O\u2019Brien's policy of accommodating Unionist opposition both from the North and from the South. But it was ten years too late. Had he joined O\u2019Brien earlier and carried the Irish Party with him, it is probable that Ireland's destiny would have been settled by evolution.{{sfn|MacDonagh|1928|p=231-232}} The Convention ended in failure as O'Brien predicted when Britain attempted to link the enactment of Home Rule with conscription.\n\nDuring the [[Conscription Crisis of 1918|anti-conscription crisis]] in April 1918 O'Brien and his AFIL left the [[House of Commons of the United Kingdom|House of Commons]] and joined Sinn F\u00e9in and other prominentaries in the mass protests in Dublin. Seeing no future for his conciliatory political concepts in a future election, he believed Sinn F\u00e9in in its moderate form had earned the right to represent nationalist interests. He and the other members of his All-for-Ireland League party stood aside putting their seats at the disposal of Sinn F\u00e9in, its candidates returned unopposed in the December [[1918 Irish general election|1918 general elections]]. In an address to the election he had said: <blockquote>''\"We cannot subscribe to a programme of armed resistance in the field, or even of permanent withdrawal from Westminster; but to the spirit of Sinn F\u00e9in, as distinct from its abstract programme, the great mass of independent single-minded Irishmen have been won over, and accordingly they ought now to have a full and sympathetic trial for enforcing the Irish nation's right of self-determination.\"''{{sfn|MacDonagh|1928|p=234}}</blockquote>\n\nO'Brien disagreed with the establishment of a southern [[Irish Free State]] under the [[Anglo-Irish Treaty|Treaty]], still believing that [[Partition of Ireland]] was too high a price to pay for partial independence.  He wrote in 1923, \"It is now obvious enough that, had the [[Irish Council Bill]] been allowed to pass in 1907, the Partition of Ireland would never have been heard of.\"{{sfn|O'Brien|1923|pp=35-36}} Retiring from political life, he contented himself with writing and declined [[\u00c9amon de Valera]]'s offer to stand for [[Fianna F\u00e1il]] in the 1927 general election. He died suddenly on 25 February 1928 while on a visit to London with his wife at the age of 75. His remains rest in Mallow, and one of the principal streets in the town bears his name to this day. His head-bust overlooks the town Council's Chamber Room and one of his finest portraits hangs in University College Cork.\n\nIn 1920 [[Arthur Griffith]] said of O'Brien:<blockquote>'' \"The task of William O\u2019Brien's generation was well and bravely done, had it not been so the work we are carrying out in this generation would have been impossible. In that great work none of Parnell's lieutenants did so much as William O\u2019Brien.\" ''{{sfn|MacDonagh|1928|p=237}}</blockquote>\n\n==Works==\nO'Brien's books, a number of which are collections of his journalistic writings and political speeches, include:\n{{Refbegin}}\n*''Christmas on the Galtees'' (1878) [http://www.ballybegvillage.com/irish_christmas.html/''Ballybeg Village Irish Christmas'']\n*''When we were boys'' (1890)\n*''Irish Ideas'' (1893) [http://www.libraryireland.com/Irish-Ideas/Contents.php/''Irish Ideas'' (1893)]\n*''A Queen of Men, Grace O'Malley'' (1898)\n*''Recolections'' (1905)\n*{{cite book|ref=harv|last=O'Brien|first=William |title=An Olive Branch in Ireland, and Its History|url=https://archive.org/details/cu31924028169062/page/n447|year=1910|publisher= Macmillan|location=London|display-authors=0}}\n* {{cite book |title=[[s:The Irish Cause and \"The Irish Convention\"|The Irish Cause and \"The Irish Convention\"]] |date=1917 |publisher=Maunsel & Company, Limited |location=Dublin}}\n*''The Downfall of Parliamentarianism'' (1918)\n*''Evening Memories'' (1920)\n*''The Responsibility for Partition'' (1921)\n*{{cite book|ref=harv|url=https://archive.org/stream/irishrevolutionh00obriuoft#page/35 |last=O'Brien|first=William|year=1923|title=The Irish Revolution and how it came about |location=London |publisher=Allen & Unwin|display-authors=0 }}\n*''Edmund Burke as an Irishman'' (1924)\n{{refend}}\n\n==Notes==\n{{Reflist|30em|refs=\n<ref name=\"Taranaki Herald\">{{cite news|url=http://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/cgi-bin/paperspast?a=d&d=TH18900718.2.15 |title=London and European Gossip|newspaper=Taranaki Herald|volume =39|issue =8834|date= 18 July 1890|p= 3}}</ref>\n<ref name=\"The Times 1914\">{{cite news The Times|date= January 29, 1914|title=Mr O'Brien's Plan: A Suspensory Veto for Ulster}}</ref>\n<ref name=\"Hansard1914-04-01\">{{Cite Hansard|house=House of Commons |title=O'Brien's Commons proposals for an inclusive Ulster settlement |url=https://api.parliament.uk/historic-hansard/commons/1914/apr/01/government-of-ireland-bill-1#column_1243 |date= 1 April 1914  |column_start=1242 |column_end=1254}}</ref>\n<ref name=\"Hansard1914-09-15\">{{Cite Hansard|house=House of Commons |title=O'Brien's Commons proposal for a scheme of federalism |url=https://api.parliament.uk/historic-hansard/commons/1914/sep/15/suspensory-bill#column_914 |date= 15 September 1914  |column_start=914 |column_end=916}}</ref>\n\n}}\n\n==References==\n{{refbegin|2|indent=yes}}\n*{{cite book|ref=harv|last=Bradley|first=Dan |title=Farm Labourers: Irish Struggle, 1900-1976|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=BpqPQgAACAAJ|year=1988|publisher=Athol Books|isbn=978-0-85034-038-9|chapter=Farm Labourer Organisations in co.

He was particularly associated with the campaigns for land reform in Ireland during the late 19th and early 20th centuries as well as his conciliatory approach to attaining [[Irish Home Rule Bill|Irish Home Rule]].\n\n==Family, education==\n[[File:William O'Brien birthplace plaque, Mallow, co Cork, Ireland.JPG|right|thumb|Birthplace plaque, Thomas Davis Street, Mallow, Co Cork]]\nWilliam O'Brien was born at Bank Place in [[Mallow, County Cork]], as second son of James O'Brien, a solicitor's clerk, and his wife Kate, the daughter of James Nagle, a local shopkeeper. On his mother's side he was descended from the distinguished [[Normans|Norman]] family of Nagles, long settled in the vicinity of Mallow giving their name to the nearby Nagle Mountains.  He was also linked through his mother with the statesman [[Edmund Burke]]'s mother's family, as well as with the poet [[Edmund Spenser]]'s family.\nThe Nagles however, no longer held the status or prosperity they once had. In the same month thirty-eight years earlier [[Thomas Osborne Davis (Irish politician)|Thomas Davis]] was born in Mallow. O'Brien's advocacy of the cause of Irish Independence was to be in the same true tradition of his esteemed fellow-townsman. Following in his footsteps he acknowledged the existence of many strands of Irishness.{{sfn|O'Donovan|2014|p=141|loc=Ch. 7}}\n\nO'Brien shared his primary education with a townsman with whom he was later to have a close political connection, [[Canon Sheehan|Canon Sheehan of Doneraile]]. He enjoyed his secondary education at the Cloyne diocesan college, which resulted in his being brought up in an environment noted for its religious tolerance. He greatly valued having had this experience from an early age, which strongly influenced his later views for the need of such tolerance in Irish national life.\n\n==Early journalism==\nFinancial misfortune in 1868 caused the O'Brien family to move to [[Cork (city)|Cork City]]. A year later his father died, and the illness of his elder and younger brother and his sister resulted in him having to support his mother and siblings. Always a prolific writer, it quickly earned him a job as newspaper reporter, first for the ''Cork Daily Herald''. This was to be the primary career which first attracted attention to him as a public figure. He had begun legal studies at Queen's College, later [[University College Cork]], but although he never graduated, he held a lifelong attachment to the institution, to which he bequeathed his private papers.\n\n==Political origins==\nFrom an early age O'Brien's political ideas, like most of his contemporaries, were shaped by the [[Fenian]] movement and the plight of the Irish tenant farmers, his elder brother having participated in the rebellion of 1867. It resulted in O'Brien himself becoming actively involved with the Fenian brotherhood, resigning in the mid-1870s, because of what he described in 'Evening Memories' (p.&nbsp;443\u20134) as \"the gloom of inevitable failure and horrible punishment inseparable from any attempt at separation by force of arms\".\n\nAs a journalist his attention was attracted in the first place to the suffering of the tenant farmers. Now on the staff of the ''Freeman's Journal'', after touring the [[Galtee Mountains]] around Christmas 1877 he published articles describing their conditions, which later appeared in pamphlet form. With this action he first displayed his belief that only through parliamentary reform and with the new power of the press that public opinion could be influenced to pursue Irish issues constitutionally through open political activity and the ballot box. Not least of all, responding to the hopes of the new [[Irish Home Rule]] movement.\n\n==United Ireland Editor==\n[[Image:Irish land war.jpg|thumb|right|Land War manifesto]]\nIn 1878 he met [[Charles Stewart Parnell]] MP at a Home Rule meeting. Parnell recognised his exceptional talents as a journalist and writer, influencing his rise to becoming a leading politician of the new generation. He subsequently appointed him in 1881 as editor of the [[Irish National Land League]]'s journal, ''United Ireland''. His association with Parnell and the [[Irish Parliamentary Party]] (IPP) led to his arrest and imprisonment with Parnell, Dillon, [[William Hoey Kearney Redmond|William Redmond]] and other nationalist leaders in [[Kilmainham Gaol]] that October.\n\nDuring his imprisonment until April 1882 he drafted the famous Land War ''[[No Rent Manifesto]]'' \u2013 a rent-withholding scheme personally led by O'Brien, escalating the conflict between the [[Irish National Land League|Land League]] and [[William Ewart Gladstone|Gladstone]]'s government.\n\n==Agitator and MP==\nFrom 1883\u20131885 O'Brien was elected MP for [[Mallow (UK Parliament constituency)|Mallow]]. Following the abolition of that constituency he represented [[Tyrone South (UK Parliament constituency)|Tyrone South]] from 1885 to 1886,  [[North East Cork (UK Parliament constituency)|North East Cork]] from 1887\u20131892, and [[Cork City (UK Parliament constituency)|Cork City]] from 1892\u20131895 and from 1901\u20131918, in the House of Commons. There were three periods of absence: 1886-7, from 1895\u20131900, and eight months in 1904.  Amid the turmoil of Irish politics in the late 19th century he was frequently arrested and imprisoned for his support for various Land League protests.\n\nIn 1884, through the newspaper ''United Ireland'' he incited a sensational homosexual scandal involving officers at [[Dublin Castle]].{{sfn|Costello|1999|p=77}}\n\nIn 1887 O'Brien helped to organise a [[rent strike]] during the [[Plan of Campaign]] at the estate of Lady Kingston near [[Mitchelstown, Ireland|Mitchelstown, County Cork]]. On 9 September, after an 8,000-strong demonstration led by [[John Dillon]] MP, three estate tenants were shot dead, and others wounded, by police at the town's courthouse where O'Brien had been brought for trial on charges of incitement under a new [[Irish Coercion Bill|Coercion Act]]. This event became known as the [[Mitchelstown#Mitchelstown Massacre|Mitchelstown Massacre]]. Later that year, thousands of demonstrators marched in London to demand his release from prison, and clashed with police at [[Trafalgar Square]] on [[Bloody Sunday (1887)|Bloody Sunday]] (13 November).\n[[Image:1887BloodySunday.jpg|thumb|left|Bloody Sunday (1887)]]\n\nEven in prison, O'Brien continued his protests, refusing to wear prison uniform in 1887. Being left without clothes, a [[Blarney]] tweed suit was smuggled in. He occasionally wore this much publicised suit in the Commons when confronting his incarcerator, [[Arthur Balfour]]. His imprisonment also inspired protests \u2013 notably the 1887 '[[Bloody Sunday 1887|Bloody Sunday]]' riots in London. In 1889 he escaped from a courtroom but was sentenced ''in absentia'' for conspiracy. He fled to America accompanied by Dillon who was on bail, then to France where both held negotiations with Parnell at [[Boulogne-sur-Mer]] over the leadership of the party. When these broke down, both returned to [[Folkestone]] giving themselves up, subsequently serving four months in [[Clonmel]] and [[Galway]] gaols. Here O'Brien began to reconsider his political future, having already been prosecuted nine times over years, using the time to write an acclaimed novel, a [[Fenian]] romance with a land reform theme set in 1860: ''When We Were Boys'',  which was published in 1890.\n\n==Marriage, reorientation==\nIn 1890 he married [[Sophie Raffalovich]], sister of the poet [[Marc-Andr\u00e9 Raffalovich|Marc Andr\u00e9 Sebastian Raffalovich]] and the economist [[Arthur Raffalovich]],<ref name=\"Taranaki Herald\" /> and daughter of the Russian Jewish banker, Hermann Raffalowich, domiciled in Paris. It was to mark a major turning point in O'Brien's personal and political life. His wife brought considerable wealth into the marriage, enabling him to act with political independence and providing finances to establish his own newspapers. His wife (1860\u20131960) who survived him by over 30 years, gave him considerable moral and emotional support for his political pursuits. Their relationship added an abiding love for France and attachment to Europe to his life, where he often retired to recuperate.\n\nBy 1891 he had become disillusioned with Parnell's political leadership, although emotionally loyal to him he tried to persuade him to retire after the [[Katherine O'Shea|O'Shea]] divorce case. On Parnell's death that year and the ensuing IPP split, he remained aloof from aligning himself with either side of the Party, either the rump pro-Parnellite [[Irish National League]] (INL) led by [[John Redmond]] MP or with the anti-Parnellite [[Irish National Federation]] (INF) group under [[John Dillon]], although he saw the weight of strength in the latter. O'Brien worked hard in the 1893 negotiations leading to the Commons passing Gladstone's [[Second Irish Home Rule Bill|Second Home Rule Bill]], which the Lords however rejected. ([[s:Irish Home Rule Speech|Gladstone's speech]] on the [[First Irish Home Rule Bill|First Home Rule Bill]] had beseeched parliament not to reject it).\n\n==United Irish League==\nDistancing himself from the party turmoils, he retired from parliament in 1895, settling for a while with his wife near [[Westport, County Mayo]], which enabled him to experience at first hand from his Mayo retreat the distressed hardship of the peasantry in the West of Ireland, trying to eke out an existence in its rocky landscape.\n\nBelieving strongly that agitational politics combined with constitutional pressures were the best means of achieving objectives, O'Brien established on the 16. January 1898 the [[United Irish League]] (UIL) at Westport, with [[Michael Davitt]] as co-founder and [[John Dillon]] present. It was to be a new grass-roots organisation with a programme to include agrarian agitation, political reform and Home Rule. It coincided with the passing of the revolutionary [[Local Government (Ireland) Act 1898]] which broke the power of the landlord dominated \"Grand Juries\", passing for the first time absolute democratic control of local affairs into the hands of the people through elected Local County Councils.\n\nThe UIL was explicitly designed to reconcile the various parliamentary fragments existing since the Parnell split, which proved very popular, its branches sweeping over most of the country organised by its general secretary [[John O'Donnell (Irish politician)|John O'Donnell]], dictating to the demoralised Irish party leaders the terms for reconstruction, not only of the party but the nationalist movement in Ireland. The movement was backed by O'Brien's new newspaper ''[[The Irish People (Cork newspaper)|The Irish People]]''.\n\nAround 1900 O'Brien, an unbending social reformer and agrarian agitator, was the most influential and powerful figure within the nationalist movement, although not formally its leader. His UIL was by far the largest organisation in the country, comprising 1150 branches and 84,355 members. The result of the rapid growth of his UIL as a national organisation in achieving unity through organised popular opinion, was to effect a quick defensive reunion of the discredited IPP factions of the [[Irish National League|INL]] and the [[Irish National Federation|INF]], largely fearing O\u2019Brien's return to the political field. He can nevertheless be regarded as the architect of the settlement of 1900.{{sfn|Jackson|2003|p=103}} The unity under [[John Redmond]] disturbed O\u2019Brien, as it resulted in most of the ineffective party candidates being re-elected in the [[1900 United Kingdom general election|1900 general election]], preventing the UIL from using its power in the pre-selection of candidates. Within a few years the IPP was however, to tactically adjunct the UIL under its wing manoeuvering it out of O'Brien's control.\n\n==Land Act architect==\nO'Brien next intensified the UIL agitation for land purchase by tenant farmers, pressurising for compulsory purchase. He formed an alliance with constructive unionists{{sfn|Potter|2011|p=208}} which resulted in the calling of the December 1902 [[Land Conference]], an initiative by moderate landlords led by [[Windham Wyndham-Quin, 4th Earl of Dunraven and Mount-Earl#Government|Lord Dunraven]] for a settlement by conciliatory agreement between landlord and tenant. The tenant representation was led by O'Brien, the others were John Redmond, [[Timothy Harrington]] and [[Sir Thomas Russell, 1st Baronet|T. W. Russell]] for the Ulster tenants.{{sfn|Miller|1973|pp=86-87}} After six sittings all eight tenant's demands were conceded (one with compromise),{{sfn|Sheehan|1921|p=99}} O\u2019Brien having guided the official nationalist movement into endorsement of a new policy of '''''\"conference plus business\"'''''. He followed this by campaigning vigorously for the greatest piece of social legislation Ireland had yet seen, orchestrating the [[George Wyndham|Wyndham]] ''[[Irish Land Acts#Wyndham Land (Purchase) Act 1903|Land Purchase Act (1903)]]'' through parliament, {{sfn|King|2009|pp=68-69}} which effectively ended [[Absentee landlord|landlordism]],  solving the age old [[Irish Land Acts|Irish Land Question]].\n\nThis masterful strategy of bringing about agreement on land purchase between tenants and landlords under the Act, resulted in a rush of landlords to sell and of tenants to buy.{{sfn|Lyons|1968|p=235|loc= Ch. 8 ''Estrangements''}} Though the Act was approved by Redmond, his deputy Dillon disfavoured the Act because he opposed any co-operation with landlords and [[Michael Davitt]] objected to peasant proprietorship under the Act, demanding land nationalisation.{{sfn|Lyons|1968|pp=236-238}} Together with [[Thomas Sexton (Irish politician)|Thomas Sexton]] editor of the party's ''[[Freeman's Journal]]'', all three campaigned against O\u2019Brien, fiercely attacking him for putting Land Purchase and Conciliation before Home Rule. O'Brien appealed to Redmond to suppress their opposition but it went unheeded. Declaring that he was making no headway with his policy, he resigned his parliamentary seat in November 1903, closed down his paper the ''Irish People'' and left the party for the next five years. It was a serious setback for the party. It also turned once intimate friends into mortal enemies.{{sfn|Lyons|1968|pp=240-241 and 236}} His Cork electorate however, insisted on pushing through his re-election eight months later in August 1904. O\u2019Brien had failed in his intention of shocking the party to its senses.\n\nDuring 1904 O'Brien had already embarked on advancing full scale implementation of the Act in alliance with [[D. D. Sheehan]] MP and his [[Irish Land and Labour Association]] (ILLA), when they formed the Cork Advisory Committee to help tenants in their negotiations.{{sfn|Sheehan|1921|pp=187-188}} Their collaboration became the new organisational base for O'Brien's political activities.{{sfn|Maume|1999|p=70}} This new alliance aggravated the Dillonite section of the IPP further. Determined to destroy both of them \"before they poison the whole country\",{{sfn|O'Brien|1976|p=170}} Dillon and the party published regular denunciations in the ''Freeman's Journal'', then coup\u00e9d O'Brien's UIL with the appointment of its new secretary, Dillon's chief lieutenant, [[Joseph Devlin]] MP, [[Grand master (order)|Grandmaster]] of the [[Ancient Order of Hibernians]], Devlin eventually gaining organisational control over the entire UIL and IPP organisations.\n\nO'Brien had in the meantime engaged with the [[Irish Reform Association]], together with Sir [[Antony MacDonnell, 1st Baron MacDonnell|Anthony MacDonnell]], a Mayo Catholic originally appointed by Wyndham, and head of the Civil Service in [[Dublin Castle administration in Ireland|Dublin Castle]], anxious to do something for Ireland. MacDonnell helped the reform group{{sfn|MacDonagh|1928|p=173}} to draft a scheme on the possible extension of the principle of self-government for Ireland.{{sfn|O'Brien|1976|pp=163\u2013165}} On 31 August 1904 the Reform Association released a preliminary report calling for the devolution of larger powers of local government for Ireland. The limited scheme was quickly and equally condemned by O'Brien's opponents, who regarded it nevertheless as a step in the right direction.\n\n==Macroom programme==\nBritain had two bills to pay for past wrongs. After financing tenant land purchase, tenant farmers were now proud proprietors largely in control of local government. The next bill to pay was for extensive rural housing of the tens of thousands of migrant farm labourers struggling to survive in stone cabins, barns or mud hovels. This was a long-standing demand by the ILLA branches and D.D. Sheehan.{{sfn|O'Donovan|2013|pp= 220\u2013237|loc=Ch 13}} In 1904 O'Brien then joined forces with Sheehan's ILLA organisation,{{sfn|Maume|1999|pp=70-71}} identifying himself with labourer's grievances and Sheehan's demand for agricultural labourers' housing, who up to then were dependent on limited provision of cottages by local County Councils or landowners at unfavourable terms.\n\nFollowing demonstrations of amazing extent addressed by O\u2019Brien and his friends during 1904 which fought and won the field in [[Charleville, County Cork|Charleville]] and [[Macroom]] (counties Cork), [[Kilfinane]] and [[Dromcolliher]] (counties Limerick), [[Tralee]] and [[Castleisland]] (counties Kerry), [[Scariff]] co. Clare, [[Ardmayle|Goolds Cross]] co. Tipperary and [[Ballycullane]] co. Wexford,{{sfn|Sheehan|1921|p=184}} a breakthrough occurred when a scheme was made public at ''\"the largest labour demonstration ever held in Ireland\"'' (''[[Cork Examiner]]''), a memorable rally in Macroom on Sunday 11 December 1904 addressed by William O'Brien.{{sfn|McKay|1992|p=33}} Preaching a gospel of social justice,{{sfn|O'Donovan|2013|pp= 228|loc=Ch 13}} his concepts became known as the '''''`Macroom programme\u00b4'''''. O'Brien grasped the prime importance of its principles and measures, when during 1905 he pressed and negotiated together with support from Sir Anthony MacDonnell (the [[Under-Secretary for Ireland]]) for what was subsequently carried into law{{sfn|O'Brien|1910|p=389}} and after the January [[1900 United Kingdom general election|1906 general election]] became the unprecedented Bryce ''[[Irish Land Acts#Labourers (Ireland) Act 1906|Labourers (Ireland) Act (1906)]]''.\n\n==Housing drive==\n[[File:Labourers' Act (Ireland) Cottage.JPG|right|thumb|Labourers Act cottages]]\nThe Second Phase of the Labourers Acts (1906\u20131914) began after the 1906 Labourers Housing Act, long demanded by the ILLA, was implemented, for which both the Redmondite and O'Brienite factions were zealous in claiming credit.{{sfn|Bradley|1988|p=28|loc=Ch. 2}} The labourer-owned cottages erected by the Local County Councils brought about a major socio-economic transformation, by simultaneously erasing the previous inhuman habitations.{{sfn|Ferriter|2010|pp=62-64}} O'Brien saying that the Labourers Acts \u2013 \"were scarcely less wonderworking than the abolition of landlordism itself\". In 1904 Davitt going so far as to declare the foreseen Labourers Act constituted \u2013 \"a rational principle of state Socialism\". This Act had enormous positive long-term consequences for rural Irish society.\n\nThe so-called 'Labourers Act' provided large scale funding for extensive state sponsored housing to accommodate rural labourers and others of the working classes. The programme financed and produced during the course of the next five years, the erection of over 40,000 working-class cottages, each on an acre of land, a complete 'municipalisation' of commodious dwellings dotting the rural Irish countryside. This unique social housing programme unparalleled anywhere else in Europe brought about an unsurpassed agrarian revolution, changing the face of the Irish landscape, much to O'Brien's expressed delight.{{sfn|O'Brien|1910|p=389}}  \n \nRenewed publication of O'Brien's newspaper ''[[Cork Free Press|The Irish People]]'' (1905\u20131909) exalting the cottage building, its editorials equally countermanding the IPPs' \"Dublin bosses\" attempts to curtail the programme, fearing settled rural communities would no longer be dependent on Party and Church. Munster took full advantage, erecting most of the cottages, additional funding providing for a further 5,000 houses under [[A. Birrell|Birrell]]'s  [[s:Irish Labourers Housing Act|''Labourers (Ireland) Act 1911'']]. The bulk of the labourers' cottages were erected by 1916, resulting in a widespread decline of rampant [[tuberculosis]], [[typhoid]] and [[scarlet fever]].{{sfn|Ferriter|2010|p=159}}\n\n==Turbulent times==\nIn the interest of political unity, O'Brien and other excluded MPs temporarily rejoined the Parliamentary Party when Redmond summoned a unity meeting in the Mansion House, Dublin in April 1908.{{sfn|Sheehan|1921|pp=199\u2013206}} Later that year, during negotiations for additional funding of land purchase under an amending bill, Redmond called a further UIL National Convention for 9 February 1909 in Dublin to regulate the issues, claiming the bill over-burdened the British Treasury and the rate payers. Over 3000 delegates attended. Devlin had the hall filled in advance with forces of his [[Molly Maguires|''militant Mollies'']], so that when O'Brien and his followers tried to speak in favour of the bill, they were battoned into silence. The convention then dubbed the 'Baton' Convention by O'Brien.{{sfn|O'Brien|1976|pp=187-188}} It was ''\"probably the stormiest meeting ever held by constitutional nationalists\"''.{{sfn|Jackson|2003|p=112}}\n\nThe bill eventually passed into law as Birrell's  ''Land Purchase Act (1909)'', but falling far short in its financial provisions.\n\nAs an outcome of the \"[[All-for-Ireland League#Baton Convention|Baton Convention]]\" O\u2019Brien felt himself again driven from the party. He foresaw that the IPP, undermined by the AOH, was on a fatal radical path which would frustrate any All-Ireland Home Rule settlement. As a counter measure he set about establishing a new League, which was to build on the success his combined \"doctrine of conciliation\" with \"conference plus business\"  achieved during the 1902 Land Conference with landlords and the ensuing 1903 Land Purchase Act. Following his engagement with the [[Irish Reform Association|Irish Reform Movement]] 1904-5 and support of the 1907 [[Irish Council Bill]] which he viewed as a step in the right direction, or \"Home Rule by instalments\", he firmly believed all moderate unionists could still be won over to All-Ireland Home Rule. For many nationalists on the other hand, the adoption of a conciliatory approach to the \"hereditary enemy\" involved too sharp a deviation from traditional thinking.\n\n==All-for-Ireland League==\n[[Image:All-for-Ireland League MPs, 1910.jpg|thumb|350px|right|[[All-for-Ireland League]] group portrait of five of its Independent [[Member of Parliament#United Kingdom|Members of Parliament]], 1910. <br>These are: [[Patrick Guiney]] ([[North Cork (UK Parliament constituency)|North Cork]]), [[James Gilhooly]] ([[West Cork (UK Parliament constituency)|West Cork]]), [[Maurice Healy]] ([[North-East Cork (UK Parliament constituency)|North-east Cork]]), [[D. D. Sheehan]] ([[Mid Cork (UK Parliament constituency)|Mid Cork]]), and [[Eugene Crean]] ([[South-East Cork (UK Parliament constituency)|South-east Cork]]). <br>The other MPs elected in January 1910 were: '''William O'Brien''' ([[Cork City (UK Parliament constituency)|Cork city]]), [[John O'Donnell (Irish politician)|John O'Donnell]] ([[South Mayo (UK Parliament constituency)|South Mayo]]) and [[Timothy Michael Healy]] ([[North Louth (UK Parliament constituency)|North Louth]]).]]\n\nIn March 1909 he inaugurated the [[All-for-Ireland League]] (AFIL) in [[Kanturk]] with [[James Gilhooly]] MP as Chairman and [[D. D. Sheehan]] Hon. Secretary. The AFIL's political objective was the attainment of an All-Ireland parliament with the consent rather than by the compulsion of the [[Church of Ireland|Protestant]]  and [[Unionism in Ireland|Unionist community]], under the banner of the \"Three Cs\", for Conference, Conciliation and Consent as applied to Irish politics. The League was supported by many prominent Protestant gentry, leading landlords and Munster business figures.{{sfn|MacDonagh|1928|p=186}} The political activist [[Canon Sheehan]] of Doneraile was also a founder member and wrote in a very long editorial for the first issue of the League's new newspaper its [[All-for-Ireland League#League's manifesto|political manifesto]].\n\nIll-health striking O\u2019Brien, he departed for [[Florence]], Italy to recuperate, returning for the January [[January 1910 United Kingdom general election|1910 general election]], in which the Cork electorate returned eight \"O'Brienite\" MPs. Throughout 1910 his AFIL movement opposed an Irish Party supported by the Catholic clergy. It returned eight independent AFIL MPs in the December [[December 1910 United Kingdom general election|1910 general election]] to be O'Brien's new political party. From July 1910 until late 1916 O\u2019Brien published the League's newspaper, the ''[[Cork Free Press]]''. Election results published by it showed Independents throughout Ireland had won 30% of votes cast.\n\nO\u2019Brien saw it opportune for a co-operative understanding with [[Arthur Griffith]]'s moderate [[History of Sinn F\u00e9in|Sinn F\u00e9in movement]], having in common \u2013 attaining objectives through \"moral protest\" \u2013 political resistance and agitation rather than militant physical-force. Neither O\u2019Brien nor Griffith advocated total [[abstentionism]] from the Commons, and regarded Dominion Home Rule, modelled on Canada or Australia, as acceptable. Although Griffith favoured co-operation, a special Sinn Fe\u00edn executive council meeting called to consider co-operation regretted it was not possible because its constitution would not allow it.{{sfn|O'Brien|1976|p=193|loc=Ch. 8}} In the following years O\u2019Brien and his party continued to associate themselves with Griffith's movement both in and out of parliament. In June 1918 Griffith asked O\u2019Brien to have the writ moved for his candidacy in the [[East Cavan (UK Parliament constituency)|Cavan-east]] by-election (moved by AFIL MP [[Eugene Crean]]) to which Griffith was elected with a sizeable majority.{{sfn|Maume|1999|p=207|loc=note 322}}\n\n==Home Rule stance==\nOn 2 November 1911 O'Brien proposed full Dominion status similar to that enjoyed by Canada, in an exchange of views with [[H. H. Asquith|Asquith]],{{sfn|O'Donovan|2014|p=145|loc=Ch. 7}} as the only viable solution to the \"Irish Question\". Home Rule became technically assured after a new Home Rule bill was introduced in 1912 with the IPP holding the balance of power at [[Palace of Westminster|Westminster]]. During the 1913\u201314 parliamentary debates on the [[Third Home Rule Act|Third Home Rule Bill]], O'Brien, alarmed by [[Unionist (Ireland)|Unionist]] resistance to the bill, opposed the IPP's coercive \"Ulster must follow\" policy, and published in the ''Cork Free Press'' end of January 1914 specific concession, including a suspensory veto right,<ref name=\"The Times 1914\" /> which would enable Ulster join a Dublin Parliament \"any price for an United Ireland, but never partition\". William O'Brien resigned his seat as MP again for a fourth time in January and re-stood to test local support for his policies, after the All-for-Ireland League suffered heavy defeats in the Cork City municipal elections.\n\nAfter the opening of parliament in February 1914 the threat of rebellion in Ulster gave O'Brien the opportunity to make an eloquent speech on the 24 February calling for generous concessions towards Ulster, but warning he would 'strenuously oppose exclusion'.{{sfn|O'Donovan|2014|p=157|loc=Ch. 7}} When the [[Ulster Volunteers]] armed in April to resist likely \"[[Rome Rule]]\", Redmond's [[Irish Volunteers]] armed likewise to ensure enactment of all-Ireland self-government. During the final stages of the second reading and debate on the Third [[Home Rule Act 1914|Home Rule Bill]] in the House of Commons, which was accompanied by Asquith's guarantee that it would never be enforced without an Amending Bill enacting the exclusion of the [[History of Northern Ireland|six Ulster counties]] with a Protestant majority, O'Brien made a powerful lengthy speech<ref name=\"Hansard1914-04-01\" /> on 1 April 1914 reiterating at length his proposals to enable Ulster remain within an All-Ireland settlement, by means of a suspensory veto upon any bill passed by a Dublin Parliament, amongst other rights and protections. Stating \"I condemn and abhor with all my heart the preparations of the Ulster Volunteers for even the possibility of slaughter between Irishmen and Irishmen\". Otherwise Ireland once divided would remain divided and 'the line on which you are presently travelling will never bring you anything except division and disaster'.\n\nOpposing O'Brien's proposals and initiatives, the Redmond-Dillon-Devlin (IPP-UIL-AOH) hardline alliance remained uncompromising with their standpoint \u2013 \"no concessions for Ulster\". In the Commons on 25 May O'Brien stated that \"we are ready for almost any conceivable concession to Ulster that will have the effect of uniting Ireland, but we will struggle to our last breath against a proposal which will divide her, and divide her eternally, if Ireland's own representatives are once consenting parties . . .\" after which he and his followers holding true to their pledge, abstained from the final vote passing the [[Home Rule Act 1914]], denouncing the bill as a \"ghastly farce\"{{sfn|O'Donovan|2014|pp=158-159|loc=Ch. 7}} ultimately as a \"partition deal\" after Sir [[Edward Carson]] leader of the [[Ulster Unionist Party]] forced through an amendment mandating the [[partition of Ireland]], the Irish Nationalists' confrontation course with Ulster ending in fiasco.\n\nWith the outbreak of [[World War I]] on 4 August 1914, Asquith proposed a [[Suspensory Act 1914|Suspensory Bill]] for the Home Rule Bill. It received [[Royal Assent]] simultaneously with its counterpart, the Government of Ireland Act 1914, on the 18 September. Although the two controversial Bills had now finally reached the statute books, the Suspensory Act ensured that Home Rule would be postponed for the duration of the conflict.{{sfn|Jackson|2003|p=164}} In the debate on 15 September in the House of Commons concerning the Suspensory Bill, O'Brien made it again clear ''\"that while we are prepared to pay almost any other price for a general national settlement, there is one price which some of us, at all events, will never in any possible circumstances consent to pay, and that is the dismemberment of our ancient Irish nation\"''. He concluded by turning to 'our fellow countrymen in Ulster' in proposing to secure for them a position of undiminished citizenship in this Empire under some projected scheme of federalism.<ref name=\"Hansard1914-09-15\" />\n\n==Last crusade==\nO'Brien saw the outbreak of World War I in August as an opportunity to undertake a last crusade to preserve at any price the unity of Ireland, by uniting the Green and Orange in a common cause,  declaring himself on the side of [[Allies of World War I|the Allied]] and Britain's European war effort. O'Brien was the first Nationalist leader to call on [[National Volunteers|Irish Volunteers]] for the front. Towards the end of August he had an interview with [[Horatio Kitchener, 1st Earl Kitchener|Lord Kitchener]], Secretary of State for War, and laid before him a scheme for raising an [[16th (Irish) Division|Irish Army Corps]] embracing all classes and creeds, South and North. Kitchener (incidentally a Protestant and born in [[County Kerry]]) favoured the idea.{{sfn|MacDonagh|1928|p=200}}  O\u2019Brien immediately summoned a meeting held in the [[Cork (city)|Cork]] Town Hall under the auspices of the All-for-Ireland League on 2 September, the hall packed with an enthusiastic audience of men and women. In a speech that far exceeded Redmond's in favour of its adherence to England cause, he said:- :{{cquote|''We are taking to-night \u2013 I don\u2019t conceal it from myself \u2013 one of the most momentous decisions in our history. If we make up our minds, for heaven's sake let there be no half-heartedness, let there be no qualifications or reservations. We have got to be honest friends or honest enemies of England. It won\u2019t do merely to say that we are willing to fight for Belgium, or to fight for Ireland, or to fight for France, much though we love those gallant nations (cheers). We have got to go further and to say, without putting a tooth in it, that we are ready to fight for England as well, in England's way (cheers). And in fighting England's battle in the particular circumstance of this war, I am convinced to the heart's core that we are fighting the most effective battle in all the ages for Ireland's liberty (cheers) as well as to save our towns and our homes and our women and children from the grip of the most appalling horde of brutes in human shape that ever cursed this earth since [[Atilla]] met his doom at the hands of eternal justice (cheers).''{{sfn|MacDonagh|1928|pp=200-201}}}}\n\nO'Brien later wrote: \"Whether Home Rule is to have a future will depend upon the extent to which the [[National Volunteers|Nationalists]] in combination with [[Ulster Volunteers|Ulster Covenanters]], do their part in the firing line on the [[Western Front (World War I)|fields of France]]\".{{sfn|O'Brien|1976|p=215}} He stood on recruiting platforms with the other National leaders and spoke out encouragingly in favour of voluntary enlistment in the [[Royal Munster Fusiliers]] and other [[Irish regiment]]s.\n\n==Changing tides==\nO'Brien, alarmed at the increased activity of Sinn F\u00e9in in 1915, predicted the danger of a potential republican eruption, culminating in the IRB [[Easter Rising|1916 Rebellion]], in which however Sinn F\u00e9in were not involved. He was forced to cease publication of his ''Cork Free Press'' in 1916 soon after the appointment of [[John Beresford, 5th Baron Decies|Lord Decies]] as Chief Press Censor for Ireland. Decies warned the press to be careful about what they published. Such warnings had little effect when dealing with such papers as the ''Cork Free Press''. It was suppressed after its republican editor, [[Frank Gallagher (author)|Frank Gallagher]], accused the British authorities of lying about the conditions and situation of republican prisoners in the [[Frongoch internment camp]].{{sfn|Martin|2006|p=9|loc=Introduction}}\n\n[[File:Ireland's National Pledge, April 1918.jpg|right|thumb|Ireland's Anti-Conscription Pledge, 1918]]\nO'Brien accepted the Rising and the ensuing changed political climate in 1917 as the best way of ridding the country of IPP and AOH stagnation. Home Rule had been lost in 1913, an inflexible IPP long out of touch with reality, reflected by Britain's two failed attempts to introduce Home Rule in 1916 and again in 1917. O'Brien refused to participate in the [[Irish Convention]] after [[Irish Unionist Party|southern unionist]] representatives he had proposed were turned down.{{sfn|MacDonagh|1928|p=231|loc=Introduction}} During the Convention Redmond belatedly adopted O\u2019Brien's policy of accommodating Unionist opposition both from the North and from the South. But it was ten years too late. Had he joined O\u2019Brien earlier and carried the Irish Party with him, it is probable that Ireland's destiny would have been settled by evolution.{{sfn|MacDonagh|1928|p=231-232}} The Convention ended in failure as O'Brien predicted when Britain attempted to link the enactment of Home Rule with conscription.\n\nDuring the [[Conscription Crisis of 1918|anti-conscription crisis]] in April 1918 O'Brien and his AFIL left the [[House of Commons of the United Kingdom|House of Commons]] and joined Sinn F\u00e9in and other prominentaries in the mass protests in Dublin. Seeing no future for his conciliatory political concepts in a future election, he believed Sinn F\u00e9in in its moderate form had earned the right to represent nationalist interests. He and the other members of his All-for-Ireland League party stood aside putting their seats at the disposal of Sinn F\u00e9in, its candidates returned unopposed in the December [[1918 Irish general election|1918 general elections]]. In an address to the election he had said: <blockquote>''\"We cannot subscribe to a programme of armed resistance in the field, or even of permanent withdrawal from Westminster; but to the spirit of Sinn F\u00e9in, as distinct from its abstract programme, the great mass of independent single-minded Irishmen have been won over, and accordingly they ought now to have a full and sympathetic trial for enforcing the Irish nation's right of self-determination.\"''{{sfn|MacDonagh|1928|p=234}}</blockquote>\n\nO'Brien disagreed with the establishment of a southern [[Irish Free State]] under the [[Anglo-Irish Treaty|Treaty]], still believing that [[Partition of Ireland]] was too high a price to pay for partial independence.  He wrote in 1923, \"It is now obvious enough that, had the [[Irish Council Bill]] been allowed to pass in 1907, the Partition of Ireland would never have been heard of.\"{{sfn|O'Brien|1923|pp=35-36}} Retiring from political life, he contented himself with writing and declined [[\u00c9amon de Valera]]'s offer to stand for [[Fianna F\u00e1il]] in the 1927 general election. He died suddenly on 25 February 1928 while on a visit to London with his wife at the age of 75. His remains rest in Mallow, and one of the principal streets in the town bears his name to this day. His head-bust overlooks the town Council's Chamber Room and one of his finest portraits hangs in University College Cork.\n\nIn 1920 [[Arthur Griffith]] said of O'Brien:<blockquote>'' \"The task of William O\u2019Brien's generation was well and bravely done, had it not been so the work we are carrying out in this generation would have been impossible. In that great work none of Parnell's lieutenants did so much as William O\u2019Brien.\" ''{{sfn|MacDonagh|1928|p=237}}</blockquote>\n\n==Works==\nO'Brien's books, a number of which are collections of his journalistic writings and political speeches, include:\n{{Refbegin}}\n*''Christmas on the Galtees'' (1878) [http://www.ballybegvillage.com/irish_christmas.html/''Ballybeg Village Irish Christmas'']\n*''When we were boys'' (1890)\n*''Irish Ideas'' (1893) [http://www.libraryireland.com/Irish-Ideas/Contents.php/''Irish Ideas'' (1893)]\n*''A Queen of Men, Grace O'Malley'' (1898)\n*''Recolections'' (1905)\n*{{cite book|ref=harv|last=O'Brien|first=William |title=An Olive Branch in Ireland, and Its History|url=https://archive.org/details/cu31924028169062/page/n447|year=1910|publisher= Macmillan|location=London|display-authors=0}}\n* {{cite book |title=[[s:The Irish Cause and \"The Irish Convention\"|The Irish Cause and \"The Irish Convention\"]] |date=1917 |publisher=Maunsel & Company, Limited |location=Dublin}}\n*''The Downfall of Parliamentarianism'' (1918)\n*''Evening Memories'' (1920)\n*''The Responsibility for Partition'' (1921)\n*{{cite book|ref=harv|url=https://archive.org/stream/irishrevolutionh00obriuoft#page/35 |last=O'Brien|first=William|year=1923|title=The Irish Revolution and how it came about |location=London |publisher=Allen & Unwin|display-authors=0 }}\n*''Edmund Burke as an Irishman'' (1924)\n{{refend}}\n\n==Notes==\n{{Reflist|30em|refs=\n<ref name=\"Taranaki Herald\">{{cite news|url=http://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/cgi-bin/paperspast?a=d&d=TH18900718.2.15 |title=London and European Gossip|newspaper=Taranaki Herald|volume =39|issue =8834|date= 18 July 1890|p= 3}}</ref>\n<ref name=\"The Times 1914\">{{cite news The Times|date= January 29, 1914|title=Mr O'Brien's Plan: A Suspensory Veto for Ulster}}</ref>\n<ref name=\"Hansard1914-04-01\">{{Cite Hansard|house=House of Commons |title=O'Brien's Commons proposals for an inclusive Ulster settlement |url=https://api.parliament.uk/historic-hansard/commons/1914/apr/01/government-of-ireland-bill-1#column_1243 |date= 1 April 1914  |column_start=1242 |column_end=1254}}</ref>\n<ref name=\"Hansard1914-09-15\">{{Cite Hansard|house=House of Commons |title=O'Brien's Commons proposal for a scheme of federalism |url=https://api.parliament.uk/historic-hansard/commons/1914/sep/15/suspensory-bill#column_914 |date= 15 September 1914  |column_start=914 |column_end=916}}</ref>\n\n}}\n\n==References==\n{{refbegin|2|indent=yes}}\n*{{cite book|ref=harv|last=Bradley|first=Dan |title=Farm Labourers: Irish Struggle, 1900-1976|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=BpqPQgAACAAJ|year=1988|publisher=Athol Books|isbn=978-0-85034-038-9|chapter=Farm Labourer Organisations in co.

It also won the [[Producers Guild of America Award for Best Theatrical Motion Picture]], and Mendes won the [[Directors Guild of America Award for Outstanding Directing \u2013 Feature Film]].\n\n== Plot ==\nOn April 6, 1917, [[Aerial reconnaissance in World War I|aerial reconnaissance]] has observed that the [[German Army (German Empire)|German army]], which has pulled back from a sector of the [[Western Front (World War I)|Western Front]] in northern [[French Third Republic|France]], is not in retreat but has made a strategic withdrawal to the new [[Hindenburg Line]], where they are waiting to overwhelm the British with [[artillery]]. In the British trenches, with [[field telephone]] lines cut, two young British soldiers, [[Lance Corporal]]s William Schofield, a veteran of the [[Battle of the Somme|Somme]], and Tom Blake, are ordered by General Erinmore to carry a message to Colonel Mackenzie of the Second Battalion of the [[Devonshire Regiment]], calling off a scheduled attack that would jeopardise the lives of 1,600 men, including Blake's brother [[Lieutenant]] Joseph Blake.\n\nSchofield and Blake cross [[no man's land]] to reach the abandoned German [[Trench warfare|trenches]]. In an underground barracks, they discover a booby-trap tripwire, which is promptly triggered by a rat. The explosion almost kills Schofield, but Blake saves him, and the two escape. They arrive at an abandoned farmhouse, where a [[Albatros Flugzeugwerke|German plane]] is shot down in a [[dogfight]] with Allied [[Aviation in World War I|aircraft]]. Schofield and Blake save the burned pilot, but the pilot stabs Blake and is shot dead by Schofield. Schofield comforts Blake as he dies, promising to complete the mission and to write to Blake's mother. Taking Blake's rings and [[dog tag]], as well as Erinmore's letter, he is picked up by a passing British unit.\n\nA destroyed canal bridge near [[\u00c9coust-Saint-Mein]] prevents the British lorries from crossing, and Schofield chooses to part with them. He uses what is left of the bridge to cross alone, and comes under fire from a German [[sniper]]. He and the sniper shoot each other simultaneously; the sniper is killed, while Schofield is knocked out. He regains consciousness at night, and finds the town in flames. He encounters another German soldier, and escapes into an abandoned building, where he stumbles into the hiding place of a French woman with an infant. She treats his wounds, and he gives her and the infant his canned food and milk from the farm. Despite the woman's pleas, Schofield leaves, after hearing the chimes of a nearby clock that it is morning and time is running out. After encountering more German soldiers, he escapes by jumping into a river. He is swept over a waterfall before reaching the riverbank. In the forest, he finds D Company of the 2nd Devons, which is in the last wave of the attack. As the company starts to move toward the front, Schofield tries to reach Colonel Mackenzie.\n\nRealising that the trenches are too crowded for him to make it to Mackenzie in time, Schofield sprints across the open battlefield, just as the infantry begins its charge. He forces his way into meeting Mackenzie, who reads the message and reluctantly calls off the attack. Schofield then finds Joseph, who was among the first wave but is unscathed. Schofield tells Joseph of his mission and that his brother Tom is dead, passing on Tom's rings and dog tag to Joseph. Joseph is distressed about his brother but thanks Schofield for his efforts. Schofield asks to write to their mother about Tom's heroics, to which Joseph agrees. Exhausted, Schofield sits under a tree, looking at photographs of his wife and two daughters.\n\n== Cast ==\n{{cast list|\n* [[George MacKay (actor)|George MacKay]] as Lance Corporal William \"Will\"

She adds that the \"false heroics and filmmaking feats of wonder\" serve to provide an \"escape from the true carnage of the 'Great War'\", and that in reality the scale of the [[World War I casualties|casualties]] was such that the potential loss of 1,600 men would not have excited the response portrayed in the film.<ref>{{citeweb|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2020/02/08/opinion/1917-movie-world-war-I.html|newspaper=New York Times|date=8 February 2020|first=Cathy|last=Tempelsman|accessdate=11 February 2020|title='1917' Turns a Horrific War Into an Uplifting Hero's Journey}}</ref>\n\nAccording to military historian Jeremy Banning, \"It made no sense, as the film depicts, to have some battalions nine miles beyond the former German line and others seemingly unaware of whether this line was manned. ...

In reality, the number of black soldiers serving in the [[British Army during World War I|British Army]] (rather than [[Colonial troops|colonial regiments]]) during World War I is unknown but is likely to have been negligible. The [[Devonshire Regiment]] was never brigaded with any West Indian or African units (it spent the war in [[8th Infantry Division (United Kingdom)|8th Division]]). Over 15,000 men from the Caribbean enlisted, including black Caribbeans living in Britain, and by 1915 it was decided to group them together into a single regiment, named the [[British West Indies Regiment]].<ref name=\"telegraph\">{{cite news |title=Fact-checking 1917: how historically accurate is Sam Mendes's First World War film? |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/films/0/1917-fact-checking-how-historically-accurate-sam-mendes-war-movie/ |work=The Daily Telegraph |date=10 February 2020}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=-6RACwAAQBAJ&pg=PA97 |title=Colonial Soldiers in Europe, 1914\u20131945: \"Aliens in Uniform\" in Wartime Societies |pages=97\u2013102|date=22 December 2015|website=|isbn=9781317330981|last1=Storm |first1=Eric |last2=Tuma |first2=Ali Al }}</ref><ref>{{cite news |title=How accurate is Sam Mendes's film, 1917? |url=https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/how-accurate-is-sam-mendess-film-1917-8mtbrbfkv |work=The Times |date=6 January 2020}}</ref> Indian [[Sikhs]] would have served in their own regiments as part of the [[British Indian Army]], not as individuals in the ranks of British regiments and Corps.

The film stars [[George MacKay (actor)|George MacKay]] and [[Dean-Charles Chapman]], with [[Mark Strong]], [[Andrew Scott (actor)|Andrew Scott]], [[Richard Madden]], Claire Duburcq, [[Colin Firth]] and [[Benedict Cumberbatch]] in supporting roles.

This message is especially important to one of the soldiers, as his brother is taking part in the pending attack.\n\nThe project was officially announced in June 2018, with MacKay and Chapman signing on in October and the rest of the cast the following March.

It also won the [[Producers Guild of America Award for Best Theatrical Motion Picture]], and Mendes won the [[Directors Guild of America Award for Outstanding Directing \u2013 Feature Film]].\n\n== Plot ==\nOn April 6, 1917, [[Aerial reconnaissance in World War I|aerial reconnaissance]] has observed that the [[German Army (German Empire)|German army]], which has pulled back from a sector of the [[Western Front (World War I)|Western Front]] in northern [[French Third Republic|France]], is not in retreat but has made a strategic withdrawal to the new [[Hindenburg Line]], where they are waiting to overwhelm the British with [[artillery]]. In the British trenches, with [[field telephone]] lines cut, two young British soldiers, [[Lance Corporal]]s William Schofield, a veteran of the [[Battle of the Somme|Somme]], and Tom Blake, are ordered by General Erinmore to carry a message to Colonel Mackenzie of the Second Battalion of the [[Devonshire Regiment]], calling off a scheduled attack that would jeopardise the lives of 1,600 men, including Blake's brother [[Lieutenant]] Joseph Blake.\n\nSchofield and Blake cross [[no man's land]] to reach the abandoned German [[Trench warfare|trenches]]. In an underground barracks, they discover a booby-trap tripwire, which is promptly triggered by a rat. The explosion almost kills Schofield, but Blake saves him, and the two escape. They arrive at an abandoned farmhouse, where a [[Albatros Flugzeugwerke|German plane]] is shot down in a [[dogfight]] with Allied [[Aviation in World War I|aircraft]]. Schofield and Blake save the burned pilot, but the pilot stabs Blake and is shot dead by Schofield. Schofield comforts Blake as he dies, promising to complete the mission and to write to Blake's mother. Taking Blake's rings and [[dog tag]], as well as Erinmore's letter, he is picked up by a passing British unit.\n\nA destroyed canal bridge near [[\u00c9coust-Saint-Mein]] prevents the British lorries from crossing, and Schofield chooses to part with them. He uses what is left of the bridge to cross alone, and comes under fire from a German [[sniper]]. He and the sniper shoot each other simultaneously; the sniper is killed, while Schofield is knocked out. He regains consciousness at night, and finds the town in flames. He encounters another German soldier, and escapes into an abandoned building, where he stumbles into the hiding place of a French woman with an infant. She treats his wounds, and he gives her and the infant his canned food and milk from the farm. Despite the woman's pleas, Schofield leaves, after hearing the chimes of a nearby clock that it is morning and time is running out. After encountering more German soldiers, he escapes by jumping into a river. He is swept over a waterfall before reaching the riverbank. In the forest, he finds D Company of the 2nd Devons, which is in the last wave of the attack. As the company starts to move toward the front, Schofield tries to reach Colonel Mackenzie.\n\nRealising that the trenches are too crowded for him to make it to Mackenzie in time, Schofield sprints across the open battlefield, just as the infantry begins its charge. He forces his way into meeting Mackenzie, who reads the message and reluctantly calls off the attack. Schofield then finds Joseph, who was among the first wave but is unscathed. Schofield tells Joseph of his mission, and that his brother is dead, giving Joseph Blake's rings and dog tag. Joseph is distressed about his brother, but thanks Schofield for his efforts. Schofield asks to write to their mother about Blake's heroics, to which Joseph agrees. Exhausted, Schofield sits under a tree, looking at photographs of his wife and two daughters.\n\n== Cast ==\n{{cast list|\n* [[George MacKay (actor)|George MacKay]] as Lance Corporal William \"Will\"

She adds that the \"false heroics and filmmaking feats of wonder\" serve to provide an \"escape from the true carnage of the 'Great War'\", and that in reality the scale of the [[World War I casualties|casualties]] was such that the potential loss of 1,600 men would not have excited the response portrayed in the film.<ref>{{citeweb|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2020/02/08/opinion/1917-movie-world-war-I.html|newspaper=New York Times|date=8 February 2020|first=Cathy|last=Tempelsman|accessdate=11 February 2020|title='1917' Turns a Horrific War Into an Uplifting Hero's Journey}}</ref>\n\nAccording to military historian Jeremy Banning, \"It made no sense, as the film depicts, to have some battalions nine miles beyond the former German line and others seemingly unaware of whether this line was manned. ...

In reality, the number of black soldiers serving in the [[British Army during World War I|British Army]] (rather than [[Colonial troops|colonial regiments]]) during World War I is unknown but is likely to have been negligible. The [[Devonshire Regiment]] was never brigaded with any West Indian or African units (it spent the war in [[8th Infantry Division (United Kingdom)|8th Division]]). Over 15,000 men from the Caribbean enlisted, including black Caribbeans living in Britain, and by 1915 it was decided to group them together into a single regiment, named the [[British West Indies Regiment]].<ref name=\"telegraph\">{{cite news |title=Fact-checking 1917: how historically accurate is Sam Mendes's First World War film? |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/films/0/1917-fact-checking-how-historically-accurate-sam-mendes-war-movie/ |work=The Daily Telegraph |date=10 February 2020}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=-6RACwAAQBAJ&pg=PA97 |title=Colonial Soldiers in Europe, 1914\u20131945: \"Aliens in Uniform\" in Wartime Societies |pages=97\u2013102|date=22 December 2015|website=|isbn=9781317330981|last1=Storm |first1=Eric |last2=Tuma |first2=Ali Al }}</ref><ref>{{cite news |title=How accurate is Sam Mendes's film, 1917? |url=https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/how-accurate-is-sam-mendess-film-1917-8mtbrbfkv |work=The Times |date=6 January 2020}}</ref> Indian [[Sikhs]] would have served in their own regiments as part of the [[British Indian Army]], not as individuals in the ranks of British regiments and Corps.

He was [[Chief Whip]] of the Irish Party from 1907 until his death in 1917.  [[File:O'Brien 40.jpg|thumb|right|Pat O'Brien in 1895]]\n\n==Biography==\nSecond son of James O\u2019Brien of [[Tullamore]], [[County Offaly|Co. Offaly]], he never married.  He trained as a mechanical and marine engineer but subsequently moved to Liverpool where he set up a business as a coal merchant.  In his early days he was a [[Fenian]] and was imprisoned as such.  After moving to England he became active in the [[Irish National Land League|Land League]] and in the Home Rule Confederation of Great Britain, and was again imprisoned in his capacity as secretary of the Commercial Branch of the Land League in Liverpool.  He became known to [[Charles Stewart Parnell|Parnell]] who chose him as candidate for North Monaghan at a by-election in February 1886 after [[Timothy Michael Healy|Timothy Healy]], who had won the seat in 1885, elected to sit for [[South Londonderry (UK Parliament constituency)|South Londonderry]].  O\u2019Brien was reluctant to stand but yielded to Parnell's instructions to be in Monaghan the following morning.  He went to catch the steamer for Ireland without returning home for his coat, but borrowed one which was several sizes too large from a friend he met in the street.  In this he appeared at the Party convention.\n\nO\u2019Brien was very active in the [[Plan of Campaign]] in 1887\u201390.  He was imprisoned 5 times in 1888 and 1890, being given sentences totalling nearly 18 months.  He always had a camera with him on Land League campaigns, and took photographs of scenes of eviction which he exhibited on a barge in the Thames opposite the House of Commons to members on the Terrace and crowds on Westminster Bridge.  [[John Patrick Hayden|J. P. Hayden]] described the circumstances of his first encounter with O\u2019Brien on 1 January 1888, at a protest meeting at Four Roads, Co. Roscommon.  O\u2019Brien and [[James Gilhooly]] were both speakers, the latter under warrant of arrest under the [[Irish Coercion Bill|Coercion Act]].

He was made whip of the Parnellite party after Parnell's death in October 1891.

He was [[Chief Whip]] of the Irish Party from 1907 until his death in 1917.  [[File:O'Brien 40.jpg|thumb|right|Pat O'Brien in 1895]]\n\n==Biography==\nSecond son of James O\u2019Brien of [[Tullamore]], [[County Offaly|Co. Offaly]], he never married.  He trained as a mechanical and marine engineer but subsequently moved to Liverpool where he set up a business as a coal merchant.  In his early days he was a [[Fenian]] and was imprisoned as such.  After moving to England he became active in the [[Irish National Land League|Land League]] and in the Home Rule Confederation of Great Britain, and was again imprisoned in his capacity as secretary of the Commercial Branch of the Land League in Liverpool.  He became known to [[Charles Stewart Parnell|Parnell]] who chose him as candidate for North Monaghan at a by-election in February 1886 after [[Timothy Michael Healy|Timothy Healy]], who had won the seat in 1885, elected to sit for [[South Londonderry (UK Parliament constituency)|South Londonderry]].  O\u2019Brien was reluctant to stand but yielded to Parnell\u2019s instructions to be in Monaghan the following morning.  He went to catch the steamer for Ireland without returning home for his coat, but borrowed one which was several sizes too large from a friend he met in the street.  In this he appeared at the Party convention.\n\nO\u2019Brien was very active in the [[Plan of Campaign]] in 1887-90.  He was imprisoned 5 times in 1888 and 1890, being given sentences totalling nearly 18 months.  He always had a camera with him on Land League campaigns, and took photographs of scenes of eviction which he exhibited on a barge in the Thames opposite the House of Commons to members on the Terrace and crowds on Westminster Bridge.  [[John Patrick Hayden|J. P. Hayden]] described the circumstances of his first encounter with O\u2019Brien on 1 January 1888, at a protest meeting at Four Roads, Co. Roscommon.  O\u2019Brien and [[James Gilhooly]] were both speakers, the latter under warrant of arrest under the [[Irish Coercion Bill|Coercion Act]].  In order to protect Gilhooly, Hayden as chair introduced O\u2019Brien as Gilhooly and Gilhooly as O\u2019Brien. Gilhooly was taken away surreptitiously from the meeting after his speech. The police subsequently followed O\u2019Brien thinking he was Gilhooly, and arrested him the next day in Athlone. They had to release him.  However he was arrested as himself a few days afterwards for his speech at Four Roads.\n\nAt the time of the Split over Parnell\u2019s leadership in December 1890, O\u2019Brien was in prison, but on his release he declared for Parnell.

He became a [[Queen's Counsel]] (QC) in 1880 and Third [[Serjeant-at-law (Ireland)|Serjeant]] in 1887.\n\nMadden wrote several  books on legal topics; but his best-known work is  ''The Diary of Master William Silence; a Study of Shakespeare and of Elizabethan Sport'', an imaganitive reconstruction of the world of  [[William Shakespeare|Shakespeare's]] [[Falstaff]]. His scholarship led [[Maurice Healy (writer)|Maurice Healy]]  to describe him as ''a don who had strayed into the Courts''.  Of his legal works the best known is ''Madden on Deeds'', which remained the standard work on the subject for many years.\n\nMadden was [[Solicitor-General for Ireland]] 1888\u20131890, and [[Attorney-General for Ireland]] in 1890\u20131892. He was made a member of the [[Privy Council of Ireland]] 9 December 1889. He was MP for [[Dublin University (UK Parliament constituency)|Dublin University]] 1887\u20131892.

Admittedly his reputation was bound to suffer in comparison to such outstanding contemporaries as [[Christopher Palles]] and [[Hugh Holmes]], in an era when the quality of Irish judges had  never been higher. Healy recalled that to appear before Madden was a pleasure, especially if one could think of an appropriate literary reference, but his actual judgments were \"weak and diffuse\".

Madden held that a quotation cannot be an offer to enter a contract, but is  merely an indication of the terms on which the seller will do business. Applying normal   rules of commercial practice, he found that if every quotation was in itself an offer which could lead to  a binding contract, the business  would  be so swamped with  obligations  which it could  not meet that it might well  go [[bankrupt]]. Therefore, it followed that  the letter of acceptance by the  prospective buyer was in fact the first  offer.

Starring [[Dixie Carter]] and [[Charles Frank]], the series satirized prime-time [[soap opera]]s such as ''[[Dallas (1978 TV series)|Dallas]]'' and ''[[Dynasty (1981 TV series)|Dynasty]]''.\n\n==Plot==\nThe series was set in [[Memphis, Tennessee|Memphis]] at a fictional mansion called Toad Hall, which was owned by one Big Guy Beck ([[Slim Pickens]]; [[Forrest Tucker]]), a very wealthy land baron. He had recently died of an undisclosed illness, and before he was cryonically frozen, he had made out a videotaped will, a piece of which was played every week, by his lawyer, George Wilhoit ([[David Healy (actor)|David Healy]]; Vernon Weddle).\n\nThe will's terms were harshest on Big Guy's oldest son, the snobbish Marshall Beck (Michael Lombard) and his equally snobbish wife Carlotta ([[Dixie Carter]]). Also aghast at the will's terms was Big Guy's wily younger wife, Kathleen (Delta Burke). The terms stated that the family wouldn't be able to collect a dime of their inheritance until they accepted Big Guy's illegitimate son, Wild Bill Westchester ([[Jerry Hardin]]) and his good-natured but ditzy wife Bootsie ([[Ann Wedgeworth]]) into their family.\n\nMany of the situations stemmed from the conniving Kathleen, Marshall and Carlotta's schemes to declare the terms and constraints of the will invalid and also to rid themselves of Wild Bill and Bootsie, not to mention the rest of the family, out of their lives, so the snobs could live it up on the money they would receive. Their wildly outlandish schemes usually and inevitably ended up failing.\n\nAlso appearing were [[Nedra Volz]], who played Big Guy's senile first wife, Winona Beck, called Mother B., who had escaped from her nursing home; and [[Charles Frank]], who played Big Guy's younger son Stanley.\n\nStanley, independently wealthy because he invested his money wisely, and thus not concerned about his inheritance from his father, was the nicest of the whole lot. Usually, it was Stanley who was able to protect Wild Bill and Bootsie (whom he and Mother B. accepted outright) from the devious scheming of his stepmother, who lusted after him; and his conniving brother and sister in-law.\n\n==Characters==\n'''Big Guy Beck''' ([[Slim Pickens]]; [[Forrest Tucker]]) A very wealthy land baron; the patriarch of Toad Hall, and the decedent whose will stipulated that his family accept his illegitimate son, Wild Bill Westchester and wife Bootsie into the family. Father of Marshall and Stanley (by first wife Mother B. whom he divorced) and was married to Kathleen when he died.  Had a tendency to end his videotapes with singing a very off-key version of \"[[Happy Trails (song)|Happy Trails]]\".\n\n'''Carlotta Beck''' ([[Dixie Carter]]) Big Guy's daughter-in-law, Marshall's snobby and shrewish wife. She considers herself the only reigning queen of Toad Hall. She, Marshall and Kathleen were always trying to get rid of the Westchesters as well as Mother B. and Stanley, so they would be the only ones who would get the vast fortune of Big Guy, and they would live it up on the money. Despite this, the three would often argue among one another as much as they fought the Westchesters. Their schemes were often thwarted by Stanley, who saw them for the connivers that they were, or by their own ineptitude. Although they shared the same goal, Carlotta couldn't stand Kathleen and vice versa. Carlotta would always snidely remind Kathleen that she was only Big Guy's ''second'' wife and thus, was only her ''stepmother-in-law''.  She was also an enemy of Mother B, given that she and Marshall had put her in the nursing home, and she would often rat out her and Marshall and their wrongdoings, in retaliation.\n\n'''Stanley Beck''' ([[Charles Frank]]) Independently wealthy (due to his wise investment of his money) Big Guy's son, younger brother of Marshall; ally and half brother of Wild Bill. Ironically, he wasn't involved with the will of Big Guy or in need of the inheritance therein, due to his own wealth. Target of lust by Kathleen whose unwelcome advances he often deflected.  Nicest member of the Becks, and welcomed Wild Bill and Bootsie immediately.  In fact, it was he who had brought the Westchesters to Toad Hall in the first place.  An avid Dr. Pepper drinker, Stanley is kind and concerned about others, but will not tolerate the more dishonest shenanigans of Marshall, Kathleen and Carlotta. Has a close bond with his mother, Mother B. (who calls him Skippy) and is usually there to help his half-brother and half-sister in-law with getting used to being wealthy after years of not having much, or in helping them in dealing with the other Becks and thwarting their schemes.\n\n'''Marshall Beck''' (Michael Lombard) Big Guy's oldest, bi-sexual (and in therapy for it) son, and as snobby as his wife. Despite his snobbishness, however, he was also slightly milquetoast and weak willed compared to his strong-willed and snotty wife. Tended to wheeze a lot because of his asthma. Although he does love Carlotta, the two argue as well; and the three snobs often quarrel among one another as well. Marshall is appalled that his late father would force him, Kathleen and Carlotta to invite his half-brother and his wife to live in their home, and is equally appalled that his younger brother and mother would welcome them with open arms. Usually put in his place by Mother B, who tended to know more about his dishonesty and often delighted in ratting him out.\n\n'''Kathleen Beck''' ([[Delta Burke]]) Big Guy's much younger second wife (She was constantly reminded by Carlotta that she was merely Big Guy's ''second wife'' and would equally remind her that she was only her ''stepmother-in-law''). She was a very wily woman who was always lusting after her younger stepson, Stanley, who often deflected her unwelcome advances. She was always needing a tranquilizer. Despite siding with Marshall and Carlotta against the Westchesters, she was also scorned by the latter who called her a tramp and slut. The three often squabbled amongst themselves as much as they fought the Westchesters. Kathleen retaliated by calling Carlotta a shrew. Thoroughly disliked by Big Guy's previous wife, Mother B. who derisively called her \"Big Girl\".\n\n'''Winona \"Mother B\" Beck''' ([[Nedra Volz]]) Marshall and Stanley's senile mother.  Big Guy's first wife, whom he divorced prior to marrying Kathleen.  She belied her age by constantly escaping her nursing home where she claimed they (meaning Marshall and Carlotta, who had presumably put her there) were holding her hostage. Mother B had no liking for Kathleen, whom she derisively called \"Big Girl\". Eventually, she escaped the nursing home for good, and ended up living in Toad Hall. She, like her favored younger son, Stanley, whom she calls Skippy, accepted the Westchesters outright and likes them. She would also often take delight in ratting out Marshall and Carlotta for their constant wrongdoing, possibly in retaliation for them putting her in the nursing home.\n\n'''Wild Bill Westchester''' ([[Jerry Hardin]])  A used RV salesman who is discovered to be Big Guy's illegitimate son. (which was proven by DNA test) Accepted by Stanley and Mother B. outright, while being plotted against by Marshall, Carlotta and Kathleen.  He and Bootsie were almost scared out of the house by Marshall, Carlotta and Kathleen, by means of a phony seance, but was convinced by Stanley and Mother B., who truly cared about them, that they would always have a home at Toad Hall, whether the other Becks liked it or not.\n\n'''Bootsie Westchester'''  ([[Ann Wedgeworth]]) Wild Bill's gentle natured but ditzy wife.  She, like Wild Bill, is thrilled to be part of the family. Her marriage was almost ruined by Kathleen, Marshall and Carlotta but she, along with Stanley's help, thwarted it. She unwaveringly loves Wild Bill, and makes the most of being on a budget.\n\n'''George Wilhoit''' (David Healy; Vernon Weddle) Big Guy's lawyer who played a section of his late client's video will every week, and was there to make sure the conditions, however outlandish, were carried out.  Some conditions were reasonable (like the family getting a job or living within a strict budget, after Marshall, Carlotta and Kathleen were caught trying to throw out the Westchesters) while others (where Big Guy had Stanley kidnapped on his birthday to find out who his true friends were) were more than a mite bit bizarre.\n\n==Production==\nSeries creator [[Linda Bloodworth-Thomason|Linda Bloodworth]] began her television career by co-writing a script for an episode of ''[[M*A*S*H (TV series)|M*A*S*H]]'' with [[Mary Kay Place]], and when that script was nominated for an [[Emmy Award]], she found herself in high demand. Bloodworth was offered staff positions on several television series, but she turned them down. \"I just wanted to get my own shows on the air\", she said.  \"I didn't want to die working those long hours for someone else's show.

Much to CBS's surprise, the show topped the weekly [[Nielsen ratings]] for three consecutive weeks.<ref name=Cashes/>  CBS Entertainment President Donald \"Bud\" Grant later commented, \"I think we conned ourselves into thinking ''Filthy Rich'' was a hot show.\"<ref>{{cite news|last=Vadeboncoeur|first=Joan E.|title=If it sounds like it's been done before, it's because it has|work=[[Syracuse Herald-Journal]]|date=June 13, 1983}}</ref>  The network scrambled to find a place on the fall schedule for the show, ultimately opting to bump the new series ''[[Mama Malone]]'' off the schedule altogether<ref name=Mexican/> (''Mama Malone'' eventually aired in 1984).\n\nAlthough viewers initially tuned in, the series fared poorly with critics.  \"This is the most misunderstood show I've ever been associated with\", said Bloodworth.<ref name=Mexican/>  [[Associated Press]] writer Fred Rothenberg commented in his widely circulated review, \"It's called ''Filthy Rich'' and the slant is more toward the former than the latter.\"<ref>{{cite news|last=Rothenberg|first=Fred|title=Filthy Rich starts tonight with far more filth than richness|work=The Daily Intelligencer|date=August 9, 1982}}</ref>  Bloodworth retaliated, \"I think because the Southern accents are thick and the first shows were very theatrical and broad, the critics tuned out.\"<ref name=Mexican/>  She went on to defend the show against the Southern critics who'd bashed the series as well. \"There are a lot of liberal-minded critics who consider themselves the keepers of the Southern flame. We're not maligning the South, we're celebrating it.\"<ref name=Mexican/>\n\nWhile working on the show, Burke felt particularly pressured to maintain a slender figure.  \"That's when I discovered [[Methamphetamine|crystal meth]], a powerful [[amphetamine]] that cut my hunger but made my heart race\", she revealed in her autobiography.<ref name=\"Eve\">{{cite book|last=Burke|first=Delta|title=Eve Wasn't a Size 6 and Neither Am I|publisher=St. Martin's Press|location=New York|date=July 1998|pages=[https://archive.org/details/deltastyleevewas00burk/page/45 45]|chapter=1 Filthy Rich: Suzanne in the Beginning|isbn=0-312-15454-2|url-access=registration|url=https://archive.org/details/deltastyleevewas00burk/page/45}}</ref>  It had the side effect of paranoia and making her lapse into unconsciousness.<ref name=\"Eve\"/>\n\nAdding further woes to the troubled series, actor [[Slim Pickens]], who played Big Guy Beck in the original hour-long pilot episode, was rushed to San Francisco Medical Center several days before the series premiered,<ref>''Associated Press'' Article, August 4, 1982</ref> and he underwent five hours of surgery to remove a brain tumor the day after the show's TV debut.<ref>{{cite news|title=Slim Pickens has surgery|work=[[Roswell Daily Record]]|date=August 11, 1982}}</ref>  Pickens was released from the hospital before production resumed on the series, but he was unfit to appear.  Most subsequent episodes played without Big Guy, though Pickens was quickly replaced by [[Forrest Tucker]], who didn't play the role with the same broad, comic zeal.\n\nProduction soldiered on a little behind schedule.  In the early weeks of September, scripts hadn't been completed for any episodes of the fall season, which began on September 26.<ref name=Wedgeworth/>  \"Every night I go home with notes on all the network suggestions and work on the scripts\", Bloodworth said.<ref name=Mexican/> \"A messenger comes to pick up my rewrites at 1 a.m. I write in longhand and the scripts are typed and returned at 7 a.m. I'm sure my neighbors think I'm in some illegal business.\"  Bloodworth quickly churned out some scripts, but she hired former [[Jimmy Carter]] speech writer [[E. Jack Kaplan]] to help pick up the slack.<ref name=Mexican/>\n\n''Filthy Rich'' returned to the air on Wednesday, October 5.  Nestled between ''[[Alice (TV series)|Alice]]'' and ''[[Tucker's Witch]]'' and opposite the new series ''[[Family Ties]]'', ratings quickly plummeted; ''Filthy Rich'' ranked #60 in the weekly TV ratings by the end of October.<ref name=revamp>{{cite news|title=CBS revamps schedule|work=[[Gettysburg Times]]|date=November 10, 1982}}</ref>  In November, six weeks into the show's second season, all three series were yanked off the schedule and replaced with ''The CBS Wednesday Movie''.<ref name=revamp/>  ''Filthy Rich'' returned to the schedule by January 1983 \u2014 on Monday nights, sandwiched between ''[[Square Pegs]]'' and ''M*A*S*H''.  Ratings didn't improve.<ref name=Dickers/>  It aired for a month before being pulled from the schedule again.  The remaining two episodes aired in June, after the series had officially been canceled.\n\n==''Designing Women'' and ''Evening Shade''==\n''Filthy Rich'' paved the way for one of CBS's most successful TV series of the late 1980s: ''[[Designing Women]]''.  \"I'd worked with Dixie and Delta on ''Filthy Rich''\", Bloodworth revealed in a 1986 interview.<ref>{{cite news|last=Buck|first=Jerry|title=CBS hoping for fast success with slow drawl in Southern comedy|work=[[The Intelligencer (Doylestown, Pennsylvania)]]|date=July 17, 1986}}</ref>  \"We've had a secret plot since then to work together again.\"  Bloodworth created the roles of Julia and Suzanne Sugarbaker for Carter and Burke<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">{{cite video | title = The Designing Women Reunion | publisher=[[Lifetime Television]] | date=2003}}</ref> (Burke referred to her ''Filthy Rich'' character as \"Suzanne in the Beginning;\"<ref name=\"Eve\"/> and Carter's Julia, with her self-righteous, long-winded monologues had more than a bit in common with Carlotta) and numerous one-liners were recycled along with a \"hog hat\" prop which was prominently featured in episodes of both series.  ''Filthy Rich'' stars [[Nedra Volz]] and [[Charles Frank]] each guest-starred on ''Designing Women'', as did guest-stars [[Tracey Walter]], [[William Utay]], [[Davis Roberts]] and John Petlock, and E. Jack Kaplan penned an early episode.  Additionally, Charles Frank reunited with Burke for an episode of the short-lived ''Designing Women'' spin-off ''[[Women of the House]]''.\n\nBy the early 1990s, another ''Filthy Rich'' cast member found work in a new Bloodworth series. ''[[Evening Shade]]'', which aired from 1990 through 1994, included Ann Wedgeworth among its cast as Merleen Eldridge, the wife of the town doctor.\n\n==US TV Ratings==\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align: center\"\n|-\n!

The result is the Westchesters are accepted in the Country Club, while Marshall and Carlotta, due to a scheme to pocket money using phony foster children, are placed on probation, which leads Carlotta to moan \"They're IN, and we're OUT!\".\n | LineColor=006400\n}}\n{{Episode list\n | EpisodeNumber=11\n | EpisodeNumber2=8\n | Title=A Beck Goes Back\n | DirectedBy=Rod Daniel\n | WrittenBy=E.

Starring [[Dixie Carter]] and [[Charles Frank]], the series satirized prime-time [[soap opera]]s such as ''[[Dallas (1978 TV series)|Dallas]]'' and ''[[Dynasty (1981 TV series)|Dynasty]]''.\n\n==Plot==\nThe series was set in [[Memphis, Tennessee|Memphis]] at a fictional mansion called Toad Hall, which was owned by one Big Guy Beck ([[Slim Pickens]]; [[Forrest Tucker]]), a very wealthy land baron. He had recently died of an undisclosed illness, and before he was cryonically frozen, he had made out a videotaped will, a piece of which was played every week, by his lawyer, George Wilhoit ([[David Healy (actor)|David Healy]]; Vernon Weddle).\n\nThe will's terms were harshest on Big Guy's oldest son, the snobbish Marshall Beck (Michael Lombard) and his equally snobbish wife Carlotta ([[Dixie Carter]]). Also aghast at the will's terms was Big Guy's wily younger wife, Kathleen (Delta Burke). The terms stated that the family wouldn't be able to collect a dime of their inheritance until they accepted Big Guy's illegitimate son, Wild Bill Westchester ([[Jerry Hardin]]) and his good-natured but ditzy wife Bootsie ([[Ann Wedgeworth]]) into their family.\n\nMany of the situations stemmed from the conniving Kathleen, Marshall and Carlotta's schemes to declare the terms and constraints of the will invalid and also to rid themselves of Wild Bill and Bootsie, not to mention the rest of the family, out of their lives, so the snobs could live it up on the money they would receive. Their wildly outlandish schemes usually and inevitably ended up failing.\n\nAlso appearing were [[Nedra Volz]], who played Big Guy's senile first wife, Winona Beck, called Mother B., who had escaped from her nursing home; and [[Charles Frank]], who played Big Guy's younger son Stanley.\n\nStanley, independently wealthy because he invested his money wisely, and thus not concerned about his inheritance from his father, was the nicest of the whole lot. Usually, it was Stanley who was able to protect Wild Bill and Bootsie (whom he and Mother B. accepted outright) from the devious scheming of his stepmother, who lusted after him; and his conniving brother and sister in-law.\n\n==Characters==\n'''Big Guy Beck''' ([[Slim Pickens]]; [[Forrest Tucker]]) A very wealthy land baron; the patriarch of Toad Hall, and the decedent whose will stipulated that his family accept his illegitimate son, Wild Bill Westchester and wife Bootsie into the family. Father of Marshall and Stanley (by first wife Mother B. whom he divorced) and was married to Kathleen when he died.  Had a tendency to end his videotapes with singing a very off-key version of \"[[Happy Trails (song)|Happy Trails]]\".\n\n'''Carlotta Beck''' ([[Dixie Carter]]) Big Guy's daughter-in-law, Marshall's snobby and shrewish wife. She considers herself the only reigning queen of Toad Hall. She, Marshall and Kathleen were always trying to get rid of the Westchesters as well as Mother B. and Stanley, so they would be the only ones who would get the vast fortune of Big Guy, and they would live it up on the money. Despite this, the three would often argue among one another as much as they fought the Westchesters. Their schemes were often thwarted by Stanley, who saw them for the connivers that they were, or by their own ineptitude. Although they shared the same goal, Carlotta couldn't stand Kathleen and vice versa. Carlotta would always snidely remind Kathleen that she was only Big Guy's ''second'' wife and thus, was only her ''stepmother-in-law''.  She was also an enemy of Mother B, given that she and Marshall had put her in the nursing home, and she would often rat out her and Marshall and their wrongdoings, in retaliation.\n\n'''Stanley Beck''' ([[Charles Frank]]) Independently wealthy (due to his wise investment of his money) Big Guy\u2019s son, younger brother of Marshall; ally and half brother of Wild Bill. Ironically, he wasn't involved with the will of Big Guy or in need of the inheritance therein, due to his own wealth. Target of lust by Kathleen whose unwelcome advances he often deflected.  Nicest member of the Becks, and welcomed Wild Bill and Bootsie immediately.  In fact, it was he who had brought the Westchesters to Toad Hall in the first place.  An avid Dr. Pepper drinker, Stanley is kind and concerned about others, but will not tolerate the more dishonest shenanigans of Marshall, Kathleen and Carlotta. Has a close bond with his mother, Mother B. (who calls him Skippy) and is usually there to help his half-brother and half-sister in-law with getting used to being wealthy after years of not having much, or in helping them in dealing with the other Becks and thwarting their schemes.\n\n'''Marshall Beck''' (Michael Lombard) Big Guy's oldest, bi-sexual (and in therapy for it) son, and as snobby as his wife. Despite his snobbishness, however, he was also slightly milquetoast and weak willed compared to his strong-willed and snotty wife. Tended to wheeze a lot because of his asthma. Although he does love Carlotta, the two argue as well; and the three snobs often quarrel among one another as well. Marshall is appalled that his late father would force him, Kathleen and Carlotta to invite his half-brother and his wife to live in their home, and is equally appalled that his younger brother and mother would welcome them with open arms. Usually put in his place by Mother B, who tended to know more about his dishonesty and often delighted in ratting him out.\n\n'''Kathleen Beck''' ([[Delta Burke]]) Big Guy's much younger second wife (She was constantly reminded by Carlotta that she was merely Big Guy's ''second wife'' and would equally remind her that she was only her ''stepmother-in-law''). She was a very wily woman who was always lusting after her younger stepson, Stanley, who often deflected her unwelcome advances. She was always needing a tranquilizer. Despite siding with Marshall and Carlotta against the Westchesters, she was also scorned by the latter who called her a tramp and slut. The three often squabbled amongst themselves as much as they fought the Westchesters. Kathleen retaliated by calling Carlotta a shrew. Thoroughly disliked by Big Guy's previous wife, Mother B. who derisively called her \"Big Girl\".\n\n'''Winona \"Mother B\" Beck''' ([[Nedra Volz]]) Marshall and Stanley's senile mother.  Big Guy's first wife, whom he divorced prior to marrying Kathleen.  She belied her age by constantly escaping her nursing home where she claimed they (meaning Marshall and Carlotta, who had presumably put her there) were holding her hostage. Mother B had no liking for Kathleen, whom she derisively called \"Big Girl\". Eventually, she escaped the nursing home for good, and ended up living in Toad Hall. She, like her favored younger son, Stanley, whom she calls Skippy, accepted the Westchesters outright and likes them. She would also often take delight in ratting out Marshall and Carlotta for their constant wrongdoing, possibly in retaliation for them putting her in the nursing home.\n\n'''Wild Bill Westchester''' ([[Jerry Hardin]])  A used RV salesman who is discovered to be Big Guy's illegitimate son. (which was proven by DNA test) Accepted by Stanley and Mother B. outright, while being plotted against by Marshall, Carlotta and Kathleen.  He and Bootsie were almost scared out of the house by Marshall, Carlotta and Kathleen, by means of a phony seance, but was convinced by Stanley and Mother B., who truly cared about them, that they would always have a home at Toad Hall, whether the other Becks liked it or not.\n\n'''Bootsie Westchester'''  ([[Ann Wedgeworth]]) Wild Bill's gentle natured but ditzy wife.  She, like Wild Bill, is thrilled to be part of the family. Her marriage was almost ruined by Kathleen, Marshall and Carlotta but she, along with Stanley's help, thwarted it. She unwaveringly loves Wild Bill, and makes the most of being on a budget.\n\n'''George Wilhoit''' (David Healy; Vernon Weddle) Big Guy's lawyer who played a section of his late client's video will every week, and was there to make sure the conditions, however outlandish, were carried out.  Some conditions were reasonable (like the family getting a job or living within a strict budget, after Marshall, Carlotta and Kathleen were caught trying to throw out the Westchesters) while others (where Big Guy had Stanley kidnapped on his birthday to find out who his true friends were) were more than a mite bit bizarre.\n\n==Production==\nSeries creator [[Linda Bloodworth-Thomason|Linda Bloodworth]] began her television career by co-writing a script for an episode of ''[[M*A*S*H (TV series)|M*A*S*H]]'' with [[Mary Kay Place]], and when that script was nominated for an [[Emmy Award]], she found herself in high demand. Bloodworth was offered staff positions on several television series, but she turned them down. \"I just wanted to get my own shows on the air\", she said.  \"I didn't want to die working those long hours for someone else's show.

We're not maligning the South, we're celebrating it.\"<ref name=Mexican/>\n\nWhile working on the show, Burke felt particularly pressured to maintain a slender figure.  \"That's when I discovered [[Methamphetamine|crystal meth]], a powerful [[amphetamine]] that cut my hunger but made my heart race\", she revealed in her autobiography.<ref name=\"Eve\">{{cite book|last=Burke|first=Delta|title=Eve Wasn't a Size 6 and Neither Am I|publisher=St. Martin's Press|location=New York|date=July 1998|pages=[https://archive.org/details/deltastyleevewas00burk/page/45 45]|chapter=1 Filthy Rich: Suzanne in the Beginning|isbn=0-312-15454-2|url-access=registration|url=https://archive.org/details/deltastyleevewas00burk/page/45}}</ref>  It had the side effect of paranoia and making her lapse into unconsciousness.<ref name=\"Eve\"/>\n\nAdding further woes to the troubled series, actor [[Slim Pickens]], who played Big Guy Beck in the original hour-long pilot episode, was rushed to San Francisco Medical Center several days before the series premiered,<ref>''Associated Press'' Article, August 4, 1982</ref> and he underwent five hours of surgery to remove a brain tumor the day after the show's TV debut.<ref>{{cite news|title=Slim Pickens has surgery|work=[[Roswell Daily Record]]|date=August 11, 1982}}</ref>  Pickens was released from the hospital before production resumed on the series, but he was unfit to appear.  Most subsequent episodes played without Big Guy, though Pickens was quickly replaced by [[Forrest Tucker]], who didn't play the role with the same broad, comic zeal.\n\nProduction soldiered on a little behind schedule.  In the early weeks of September, scripts hadn't been completed for any episodes of the fall season, which began on September 26.<ref name=Wedgeworth/>  \"Every night I go home with notes on all the network suggestions and work on the scripts\", Bloodworth said.<ref name=Mexican/> \"A messenger comes to pick up my rewrites at 1 a.m. I write in longhand and the scripts are typed and returned at 7 a.m. I'm sure my neighbors think I'm in some illegal business.\"  Bloodworth quickly churned out some scripts, but she hired former [[Jimmy Carter]] speech writer [[E. Jack Kaplan]] to help pick up the slack.<ref name=Mexican/>\n\n''Filthy Rich'' returned to the air on Wednesday, October 5.  Nestled between ''[[Alice (TV series)|Alice]]'' and ''[[Tucker's Witch]]'' and opposite the new series ''[[Family Ties]]'', ratings quickly plummeted; ''Filthy Rich'' ranked #60 in the weekly TV ratings by the end of October.<ref name=revamp>{{cite news|title=CBS revamps schedule|work=[[Gettysburg Times]]|date=November 10, 1982}}</ref>  In November, six weeks into the show's second season, all three series were yanked off the schedule and replaced with ''The CBS Wednesday Movie''.<ref name=revamp/>  ''Filthy Rich'' returned to the schedule by January 1983 \u2014 on Monday nights, sandwiched between ''[[Square Pegs]]'' and ''M*A*S*H''.

The remaining two episodes aired in June, after the series had officially been canceled.\n\n==''Designing Women'' and ''Evening Shade''==\n''Filthy Rich'' paved the way for one of CBS's most successful TV series of the late 1980s: ''[[Designing Women]]''.  \"I'd worked with Dixie and Delta on ''Filthy Rich''\", Bloodworth revealed in a 1986 interview.<ref>{{cite news|last=Buck|first=Jerry|title=CBS hoping for fast success with slow drawl in Southern comedy|work=[[The Intelligencer (Doylestown, Pennsylvania)]]|date=July 17, 1986}}</ref>  \"We've had a secret plot since then to work together again.\"  Bloodworth created the roles of Julia and Suzanne Sugarbaker for Carter and Burke<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">{{cite video | title = The Designing Women Reunion | publisher=[[Lifetime Television]] | date=2003}}</ref> (Burke referred to her ''Filthy Rich'' character as \"Suzanne in the Beginning;\"<ref name=\"Eve\"/> and Carter's Julia, with her self-righteous, long-winded monologues had more than a bit in common with Carlotta) and numerous one-liners were recycled along with a \"hog hat\" prop which was prominently featured in episodes of both series.  ''Filthy Rich'' stars [[Nedra Volz]] and [[Charles Frank]] each guest-starred on ''Designing Women'', as did guest-stars [[Tracey Walter]], [[William Utay]], [[Davis Roberts]] and John Petlock, and E.

Additionally, Charles Frank reunited with Burke for an episode of the short-lived ''Designing Women'' spin-off ''[[Women of the House]]''.\n\nBy the early 1990s, another ''Filthy Rich'' cast member found work in a new Bloodworth series. ''[[Evening Shade]]'', which aired from 1990 through 1994, included Ann Wedgeworth among its cast as Merleen Eldridge, the wife of the town doctor.\n\n==US TV Ratings==\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align: center\"\n|-\n!
