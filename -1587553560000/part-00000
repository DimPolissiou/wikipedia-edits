All were delivered between 1954 and 1956.<ref>[http://www.railpage.com.au/locos/x-class-diesel-wa X Class (diesel, WA)] Railpage</ref>\n\n==Operation==\n[[File:XA1402, Forrestfield, 1987.JPG|left|upright|thumb|XA 1402 at [[Forrestfield, Western Australia|Forrestfield]] Yard in August 1987]]\nThe X class revolutionised operations on the WAGR. Their light axle load of around 12 tons meant they could travel on all lines, and the dual cab arrangement eliminated the need for turning. They were quickly allocated to express passenger trains including the ''[[Albany, Western Australia|Albany]] Express'', ''[[Transwa Australind|Australind]]'', ''[[Kalgoorlie]] Express'' and ''[[The Westland]]''. Although considered as good runners, the eight driving wheels being attached to the rigid main frame caused these locomotives to ride roughly.\n\n==The Crossley engine==\nAt the time of construction, the HST-V8 was an untested concept, though the engine itself was an evolution of a design used successfully in patrol boats during World War Two<ref>Doncaster, N: The Crossley Experience''' \"The Partyline\"''' - the in-house magazine of Steamtown Peterborough. Number 71, Spring 1998</ref>. One line of thought is the motor was an evolution of either of the HRN8 marine diesel, or the HRP8 stationary diesel <ref name=puse>Pusenjak,N 2014 The Westland: The Journal of Rail Heritage WA - Special Edition X Class 60th Anniversary, The WAGR X Class Locomotive; A look back with todays hindsight pp5-18</ref>.\n\nFailures commenced within weeks of the first locomotives being unveiled. It was only the skill of staff at WAGR's [[Midland Railway Workshops]] that saved the day. In their early days, availability was less than for steam.\n\nThe engines used Crossley's system of [[exhaust pulse pressure charging]] and developed 1,200 horsepower (895&nbsp;kW) at 625&nbsp;rpm, though in 1981 they were down-rated to 875&nbsp;hp at 600rpm. There were no valves, and inlet and exhaust were via ports in the cylinder walls.\n\nThe engines burnt and leaked oil, had underfed bearings, vibrated and popped heads and pistons, and suffered from ring scuffing for most of their lives. It was only the engineering excellence, and perseverance of Midland Railway Workshops staff that kept the locomotives operating, and performance improving. In the end, over 600 design faults, mainly in the Crossley engine, were overcome. One of the strategies used to minimise problems was to de-rate the engine to 1045hp (officially quoted as 1000hp).\n\nBecause of the multitudinous problems, rumours persisted that the engine was either war surplus, or formerly from a sub-maritime application.<ref name=OB1 >Oberg, L ''Locomotives of Australia'', Reed Books 1975</ref> Neither of these are correct, despite some publications suggesting this.<ref name=LOberg >{{cite book|last=Oberg|first=Leon|title=Locomotives of Australia 1850s-1980s|year=1984|publisher=Reed Books|location=Frenchs Forest|isbn=0 730100 05 7|page=214}}</ref> The myth may have arisen from Crossleys success in delivering robust engines for marine and other modes of transport. It has been noted that the Irish Railways [[C\u00f3ras Iompair \u00c9ireann|(CI\u00c9)]], through the respected Engineer [[Oliver Bulleid]], had \"heard\" through the British Admiralty that the \"Crossley unit gave no trouble\".<ref name=rhen >Renehan,D: \"Crossley diesels of CIE\" ''Journal of the Irish Railway Record Society'', Volume 15, pp. 25-35 and 70-79.</ref>\n\nThe Smith Royal Commission into the class identified blind faith in the British manufacturers, and chided the WAGR for ignoring the advice of supervising engineers in the UK who reported problems with the diesel motor during testing.<ref>Smith Royal Commission (dates pending)</ref> Whilst CI\u00c9 re-engined their similarly powered Crossley [[CIE 001 Class|001 Class]] locomotives to rid themselves of the problem,<ref name=rhen /> The Smith Royal Commission recommended against rebuilding, proposing that the entire class be replaced wholesale. To be fair to the WAGR, they were not the only ones that rushed into buying unproven traction: [[British Rail|British Railways]] also did the same, buying many different types of diesel locomotives from many different manufacturers in their haste to dieselise, including purchasing the [[British Rail Class 28|unsuccessful Class 28 Co-Bo locomotives]], which could be regarded as \"first cousins\" to the WAGR X class.<ref>Wragg,D 2004 : Signal Failure. Politics and Britains Railways Sutton Publishing</ref>\n\n==Multiple unit working==\n[[File:X1007.jpg|thumb|X 1007 in [[Old Bunbury railway station|Bunbury]]]]\nDuring construction, 16 locomotives were fitted with multiple unit control and denoted as XA class.<ref>Richardson, LC \"The Western Australian Government Railways X-Class Diesel-Electric Locomotive\" [[Australian Railway History|Australian Railway Historical Society Bulletin]] March 1955, pp. 25-28.</ref><ref>[http://www.railpage.com.au/locos/xa-class-diesel-wa XA Class (diesel, WA)] Railpage</ref> These locomotives included communication doors at each end, and were numbered in a separate block starting from 1401.\n\nFrom December 1963, Midland Workshops fitted 10 of the X class for multiple unit working, and these were reclassified as XB class.<ref name=LOberg/><ref>[http://www.railpage.com.au/locos/xb-class-diesel-wa XB Class (diesel, WA)] Railpage</ref> Units so converted were not fitted with communication doors, and retained their original 10XX series numbers.\n\n==Other modifications==\nWhilst the class were built with locomotive pneumatic braking and train vacuum braking systems, during 1969 and 1970 eight of the XA class were modified to operate with dual vacuum/air braking systems manufactured by [[Davies and Metcalfe]] to allow them to operate air-braked salt traffic on the Esperance Branch. This equipment was removed in the early 1980s, only to be reinstalled in XA 1406 (October 1986) and XA 1403 (November 1986) to allow these units to haul ex-[[Queensland Rail|Queensland Railways]] coaches on suburban services.\n\n==End of career==\nIn their final years, those still in service were reputed to have performed well. They ran grain trains in the South West as late as 1984, and provided power for trains following the reopening of the Fremantle line up to the last retirement (XA 1402) in 1988.\n\nThe first were withdrawn in 1973, primarily as sources of spare parts. The last in service, Xa1402 was withdrawn on 31 March 1988, after completing a transfer working<ref name=Barbs>Barber, S: X Class Reminders: The Westland: The Journal of Rail Heritage WA - Special Edition X Class 60th Anniversary, Myths and Memories pp25-26 </ref>.\n\nThe last of the the class to operate on the public network was Xa1401, working a consist of sleeping cars back from Dowerin 27 August 2004 <ref name=Barbs/>.\n\n==Names==\nThe locomotives carried the names of tribes, tribal leaders and warriors from around Australia. Within the WAGR, proposals were made to code the class as \"T\", and for the class to be known as the \"Tribal class\". This was not adopted. However, confusion at the time resulted in duplications and incorrect spellings.\n\nWithin the WAGR, the class earnt the nickname \"Hummingbirds\" while they were called \"Submarines\" by rail enthusiasts.\n\n==Status list==\nThe 48 locomotives were:<ref>[http://www.hothamvalleyrailway.com.au/xa_diesel_loco.htm XA Class Diesel Electric Locomotive] Hotham Valley Railway</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Tindale's Catalogue of Australian Aboriginal Tribes|url=http://archives.samuseum.sa.gov.au/tindaletribes/index.html|publisher=[[South Australian Museum]]|accessdate=18 September 2012}}</ref>\n\n{{Col-begin}}\n{{Col-1-of-2}}\n{|cellpadding=\"2\"\n|\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n!Class\n!No\n!Locomotive name\n!Indigenous group\n!Status\n|-\n|align=right|X\n|1001\n|''[[Yellagonga|Yalagonga]]''\n| [[Whadjuk]]\n|Preserved\n|-\n|align=right|X\n|1002\n|''Bibbulmun''\n|Pibelmen\n|Scrapped\n|-\n|align=right|X\n|1003\n|''Ditu-Wonga''\n|Nangatadjara\n|Scrapped\n|-\n|align=right|XB\n|1004\n|''Kadjerden''\n|\n|Scrapped\n|-\n|align=right|X\n|1005\n|''Meananger'' \n|[[Minangkabau people|Minang]]\n|Scrapped\n|-\n|align=right|XB\n|1006\n|''Nangamada''\n|Njangamarda\n|Scrapped\n|-\n|align=right|X\n|1007\n|''Natingaro''\n|Kalamaia\n|Scrapped\n|-\n|align=right|XB\n|1008\n|''Warrangoo''\n|[[Koreng]]\n|Scrapped\n|-\n|align=right|X\n|1009\n|''Arnga''\n|Arnga\n|Scrapped\n|-\n|align=right|X\n|1010\n|''Arawodi''\n|Arnga\n|Scrapped\n|-\n|align=right|X\n|1011\n|''Balgua''\n|Bailgu\n|Scrapped\n|-\n|align=right|X\n|1012\n|''Ballardong''\n|Balardong\n|Scrapped\n|-\n|align=right|X\n|1013\n|''Boonara''\n|Ngardi\n|Scrapped\n|-\n|align=right|X\n|1014\n|''Churoro''\n|Tjuroro\n|Scrapped\n|-\n|align=right|X\n|1015\n|''Cheangwa''\n|Wadjari\n|Scrapped\n|-\n|align=right|X\n|1016\n|''Djukin''\n|[[Jukun people (Australia)|Djugun]]\n|Scrapped\n|-\n|align=right|XB\n|1017\n|''Ewenyoon''\n|Djaui\n|Scrapped\n|-\n|align=right|XB\n|1018\n|''Inpirra''\n|Inggarda\n|Scrapped\n|-\n|align=right|X\n|1019\n|''Ingarra''\n|Inggarda\n|Scrapped\n|-\n|align=right|XB\n|1020\n|''Jargurdi''\n|\n|Scrapped\n|-\n|align=right|X\n|1021\n|''Jarroo''\n|Djaru\n|Scrapped\n|-\n|align=right|XB\n|1022\n|''Kardagur''\n|Wardandi\n|Scrapped\n|-\n|align=right|X\n|1023\n|''Kariera''\n|Kariara\n|Scrapped\n|-\n|align=right|XB\n|1024\n|''Kogara''\n|Murunitja\n|Scrapped\n|-\n|align=right|X\n|1025\n|''Loonga''\n|Kitja\n|Scrapped\n|-\n|align=right|X\n|1026\n|''Mangala''\n|Mangarla\n|Scrapped\n|-\n|align=right|XB\n|1027\n|''Marangal''\n|\n|Scrapped\n|-\n|align=right|X\n|1028\n|''Meeraman''\n|Pibelmen\n|Scrapped\n|-\n|align=right|X\n|1029\n|''Muliarra''\n|Wadjari\n|Scrapped\n|-\n|align=right|X\n|1030\n|''Mooroon''\n|Murunitja\n|Scrapped\n|-\n|align=right|X\n|1031\n|''Yauera''\n|Jawuru\n|Scrapped\n|-\n|align=right|XB\n|1032\n|''Yeithi''\n|Jeidji\n|Scrapped\n|-\n|}\n|}\n\n{{Col-2-of-2}}\n\n{|cellpadding=\"2\"\n|\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n!Class\n!Road<br>no\n!Locomotive name\n!Indigenous group\n!Notes\n|-\n|align=right|XA\n|1401\n|''Pedong''\n|Kokatja\n|Preserved\n|-\n|align=right|XA\n|1402\n|''Targari''\n|Targari\n|Preserved\n|-\n|align=right|XA\n|1403\n|''Wanbiri''\n|[[Mirning people|Mirning]]\n|Scrapped\n|-\n|align=right|XA\n|1404\n|''Pardoo''\n|Kokatja\n|Scrapped\n|-\n|align=right|XA\n|1405\n|''Warienga''\n|Wariangga\n|Preserved\n|-\n|align=right|XA\n|1406\n|''Ungarinyin''\n|Ngarinjin\n|Scrapped\n|-\n|align=right|XA\n|1407\n|''Wirngir''\n|Wirngir\n|Scrapped\n|-\n|align=right|XA\n|1408\n|''Wolmeri''\n|Walmadjari\n|Scrapped\n|-\n|align=right|XA\n|1409\n|''Unambal''\n|Wunambal\n|Scrapped\n|-\n|align=right|XA\n|1410\n|''Tenma''\n|Tenma\n|Scrapped\n|-\n|align=right|XA\n|1411\n|''Weedookarri''\n|Njamal\n|Preserved\n|-\n|align=right|XA\n|1412\n|''Noala''\n|Noala\n|Scrapped\n|-\n|align=right|XA\n|1413\n|''Yabaroo''\n|Wardandi\n|Scrapped\n|-\n|align=right|XA\n|1414\n|''Yindi''\n|Maduwongga\n|Scrapped\n|-\n|align=right|XA\n|1415\n|''Wurara''\n|Worora\n|Preserved\n|-\n|align=right|XA\n|1416\n|''Niligara''\n|\n|Scrapped\n|-\n|}\n|}\n\n{{Col-end}}\n\n==Preservation==\nOne X class and five XA class locomotives have been preserved:\n* X 1001 ''Yalagonga'' -

They were quickly allocated to express passenger trains including the ''[[Albany, Western Australia|Albany]] Express'', ''[[Transwa Australind|Australind]]'', ''[[Kalgoorlie]] Express'' and ''[[The Westland]]''. Although considered as good runners, the eight driving wheels being attached to the rigid main frame caused these locomotives to ride roughly.\n\n==The Crossley engine==\nAt the time of construction, the HST-V8 was an untested concept, though the engine itself was an evolution of a design used successfully in patrol boats during World War Two.<ref>Doncaster, N: The Crossley Experience''' \"The Partyline\"''' - the in-house magazine of Steamtown Peterborough. Number 71, Spring 1998</ref> Failures commenced within weeks of the first locomotives being unveiled. It was only the skill of staff at WAGR's [[Midland Railway Workshops]] that saved the day. In their early days, availability was less than for steam.\n\nThe engines used Crossley's system of [[exhaust pulse pressure charging]] and developed 1,200 horsepower (895&nbsp;kW) at 625&nbsp;rpm, though in 1981 they were down-rated to 875&nbsp;hp at 600rpm. There were no valves, and inlet and exhaust were via ports in the cylinder walls.\n\nThe engines burnt and leaked oil, had underfed bearings, vibrated and popped heads and pistons, and suffered from ring scuffing for most of their lives. It was only the engineering excellence, and perseverance of Midland Railway Workshops staff that kept the locomotives operating, and performance improving. In the end, over 600 design faults, mainly in the Crossley engine, were overcome. One of the strategies used to minimise problems was to de-rate the engine to 1045hp (officially quoted as 1000hp).\n\nBecause of the multitudinous problems, rumours persisted that the engine was either war surplus, or formerly from a sub-maritime application.<ref name=OB1 >Oberg, L ''Locomotives of Australia'', Reed Books 1975</ref> Neither of these are correct, despite some publications suggesting this.<ref name=LOberg >{{cite book|last=Oberg|first=Leon|title=Locomotives of Australia 1850s-1980s|year=1984|publisher=Reed Books|location=Frenchs Forest|isbn=0 730100 05 7|page=214}}</ref> The myth may have arisen from Crossleys success in delivering robust engines for marine and other modes of transport. It has been noted that the Irish Railways [[C\u00f3ras Iompair \u00c9ireann|(CI\u00c9)]], through the respected Engineer [[Oliver Bulleid]], had \"heard\" through the British Admiralty that the \"Crossley unit gave no trouble\".<ref name=rhen >Renehan,D: \"Crossley diesels of CIE\" ''Journal of the Irish Railway Record Society'', Volume 15, pp. 25-35 and 70-79.</ref>\n\nThe Smith Royal Commission into the class identified blind faith in the British manufacturers, and chided the WAGR for ignoring the advice of supervising engineers in the UK who reported problems with the diesel motor during testing.<ref>Smith Royal Commission (dates pending)</ref> Whilst CI\u00c9 re-engined their similarly powered Crossley [[CIE 001 Class|001 Class]] locomotives to rid themselves of the problem,<ref name=rhen /> The Smith Royal Commission recommended against rebuilding, proposing that the entire class be replaced wholesale. To be fair to the WAGR, they were not the only ones that rushed into buying unproven traction: [[British Rail|British Railways]] also did the same, buying many different types of diesel locomotives from many different manufacturers in their haste to dieselise, including purchasing the [[British Rail Class 28|unsuccessful Class 28 Co-Bo locomotives]], which could be regarded as \"first cousins\" to the WAGR X class.<ref>Wragg,D 2004 : Signal Failure.

This equipment was removed in the early 1980s, only to be reinstalled in XA 1406 (October 1986) and XA 1403 (November 1986) to allow these units to haul ex-[[Queensland Rail|Queensland Railways]] coaches on suburban services.\n\n==End of career==\nIn their final years, those still in service were reputed to have performed well. They ran grain trains in the South West as late as 1984, and provided power for trains following the reopening of the Fremantle line up to the last retirement (XA 1402) in 1988.\n\nThe first were withdrawn in 1973, primarily as sources of spare parts.

Within the WAGR, proposals were made to code the class as \"T\", and for the class to be known as the \"Tribal class\". This was not adopted.

He became a priest in 1776 and served in that capacity in Ireland for more than four decades. After the Pope declined to appoint him [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Armagh|Archbishop of Armagh]], the diocese in which he served as Vicar General, he was instead installed as the second [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Philadelphia|Bishop of Philadelphia]] in 1819. Conwell took up the post at an advanced age, and spent much of his time there feuding with the lay trustees of his parishes, especially those of [[St. Mary's Roman Catholic Church (Philadelphia)|St. Mary's Church]] in Philadelphia. When Conwell removed and excommunicated [[William Hogan (priest)|William Hogan]], a controversial priest at St. Mary's, the parish trustees instead rejected Conwell's authority, creating a minor schism. The two sides partially reconciled by 1826, but the Vatican hierarchy believed Conwell had ceded too much power to the laymen in the process, and recalled him to Rome. Although he retained his position, Conwell was compelled to relinquish actual control to his [[coadjutor bishop]], [[Francis Kenrick]]. He remained in Philadelphia and performed some priestly duties, but for all practical purposes no longer ran the diocese. He died there in 1842 at the age of about Snapchat: hell.boy1009\n\n==Early life and priesthood==\nConwell was born about 1748 in [[Moneymore]], [[County Derry]], Ireland (present-day [[Northern Ireland]]), the son of Owen Conwell and his wife, Mary (Keegan) Conwell.{{efn|Earlier sources give Conwell's date of birth as about 1745, but an Irish researcher, Brother Luke of De La Salle Monastery in [[Muine Bheag]], later discovered evidence that it was likely 1748.{{sfn|Luke|1940|pp=291\u2013292}}}}{{sfn|Luke|1940|pp=291\u2013292}}{{sfn|Griffin|1915|p=162}} He studied at the [[Irish College in Paris]] and was [[Holy Orders|ordained]] to the priesthood there in November 1776.{{sfn|Griffin|1915|p=162}}{{sfn|Ennis|1976|p=86}} Conwell was well-educated, being fluent in Latin, French, Spanish, and Italian, but had a reputation as a preacher of only modest ability.{{sfn|Griffin|1915|p=166}} Around 1785, he contemplated moving to the United States but was concerned about the still uncertain financial state of the new country's parishes, and ultimately decided not to apply for a position there.{{sfn|Ennis|1976|p=86}} He was appointed [[parish priest]] of [[Dungannon]] in 1792 or 1793 and [[Vicar General]] of the [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Armagh|Archdiocese of Armagh]] in 1794.{{sfn|Luke|1940|pp=291\u2013292}}{{sfn|Loughlin|1908}} After the death of Archbishop [[Richard O'Reilly]] in 1818, Conwell served as acting Archbishop.{{sfn|Griffin|1915|p=163}}\n\n==Bishop of Philadelphia==\n===Ordination===\nMany of the clergy who served under him in Armagh recommended that the Pope appoint Conwell to head the diocese permanently.{{sfn|Griffin|1915|p=163}} Some opposed him, accusing him of being frequently absent from his parish to visit France and Scotland.{{sfn|MacAuley|1982|pp=342\u2013343}} The British government also objected, favoring [[Patrick Curtis]] instead, as they saw him as more friendly to their interests.{{sfn|Griffin|1915|p=163}} The Vatican agreed,{{Failed verification|date=April 2020}} and [[Pope Pius VII]] appointed Curtis to Armagh, offering Conwell instead a choice of the [[Episcopal see|sees]] of [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Philadelphia|Philadelphia]] or [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Madras and Mylapore|Madras]]; Conwell chose Philadelphia.{{sfn|Griffin|1915|p=163}} Now more than 70 years old, he was ordained bishop in London on September 24, 1819, by Bishop [[William Poynter]], the [[Vicar Apostolic of the London District]], assisted by Fathers [[James Bramston (bishop)|James Bramston]] and [[Joseph Francis Carpue]].{{efn|Although three bishops are typically required for ordination, the Pope may issue a dispensation when co-consecrators are unavailable.{{sfn|Code of Canon Law}} }}{{sfn|Bransom|1990|p=13}}\n\nThe see of Philadelphia had been vacant since the death of Bishop [[Michael Francis Egan]] in 1814, despite several efforts to fill it.{{sfn|Shea|1886|p=156}} Archbishop [[John Carroll (bishop)|John Carroll]] of Baltimore, whose [[Ecclesiastical province|province]] included Philadelphia, had considered no fewer than fifteen priests for the position; some had been ruled out for one reason or another, and others (including the apostolic administrator, [[Louis de Barth]]) had turned the job down.{{sfn|Ennis|1976|pp=80\u201381}} Part of the delay was logistical\u2014Carroll was unsure of the exact procedure for selecting a candidate in the recently erected province\u2014but part was due to the perceived undesirability of the post, which oversaw only a few small churches in a part of the nation with few Catholics.{{sfn|Ennis|1976|pp=80\u201381}} There was also a significant dispute (known as [[trusteeism]]) over the rights of churches' [[Laity|lay]] trustees that was likely to complicate the job of running the diocese. In Europe, the Church owned property and directly controlled its parishes through the clergy. In the United States, however, early Catholic churches were typically founded by laymen who purchased the property, and erected the church buildings. Those laypeople accordingly demanded some control over the administration of the parish, even after the arrival of clergy from Europe who held the traditional view of parish organization.{{sfn|Carey|1978|pp=357\u2013358}} In a larger sense, the dispute represented a difference in understandings of authority between Americans and Europeans.{{sfn|Hessinger|2011|p=368}}\n\n===Hogan schism===\n[[File:Old St. Mary's Church.jpg|thumb|[[St. Mary's Roman Catholic Church (Philadelphia)|St. Mary's Church]] in Philadelphia was the epicenter of the disputes that overshadowed Conwell's episcopate.]]\nConwell arrived in [[Philadelphia]] on December 2, 1820.{{sfn|Loughlin|1908}} The trusteeism dispute had only grown more bitter during the vacancy preceding his arrival. Shortly before Conwell reached the diocese, a priest, [[William Hogan (priest)|William Hogan]], approached de Barth (then administering the diocese until a bishop was appointed) about securing an assignment to preach in Philadelphia.{{sfn|Griffin|1913|pp=23\u201324}} After only a cursory investigation of his past, de Barth agreed, and Hogan was assigned to [[St. Mary's Roman Catholic Church (Philadelphia)|St. Mary's Church]].{{sfn|Ennis|1976|p=91}} Hogan quickly ingratiated himself with the laymen who made up the board of trustees, siding with them in their dispute with the other clergy.{{sfn|Ennis|1976|p=91}} Hogan's other behavior created tension between him and Conwell. When Conwell arrived, Hogan had already moved out of the priests' residence at [[Old St. Joseph's Church]] to a house across the street, claiming that the original accommodations were poor; his detractors said he used the private residence to entertain women.

He became a priest in 1776 and served in that capacity in Ireland for more than four decades. After the Pope declined to appoint him [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Armagh|Archbishop of Armagh]], the diocese in which he served as Vicar General, he was instead installed as the second [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Philadelphia|Bishop of Philadelphia]] in 1819. Conwell took up the post at an advanced age, and spent much of his time there feuding with the lay trustees of his parishes, especially those of [[St. Mary's Roman Catholic Church (Philadelphia)|St. Mary's Church]] in Philadelphia. When Conwell removed and excommunicated [[William Hogan (priest)|William Hogan]], a controversial priest at St. Mary's, the parish trustees instead rejected Conwell's authority, creating a minor schism. The two sides partially reconciled by 1826, but the Vatican hierarchy believed Conwell had ceded too much power to the laymen in the process, and recalled him to Rome. Although he retained his position, Conwell was compelled to relinquish actual control to his [[coadjutor bishop]], [[Francis Kenrick]]. He remained in Philadelphia and performed some priestly duties, but for all practical purposes no longer ran the diocese. He died there in 1842 at the age of about 94.\n\n==Early life and priesthood==\nConwell was born about 1748 in [[Moneymore]], [[County Derry]], Ireland (present-day [[Northern Ireland]]), the son of Owen Conwell and his wife, Mary (Keegan) Conwell.{{efn|Earlier sources give Conwell's date of birth as about 1745, but an Irish researcher, Brother Luke of De La Salle Monastery in [[Muine Bheag]], later discovered evidence that it was likely 1748.{{sfn|Luke|1940|pp=291\u2013292}}}}{{sfn|Luke|1940|pp=291\u2013292}}{{sfn|Griffin|1915|p=162}} He studied at the [[Irish College in Paris]] and was [[Holy Orders|ordained]] to the priesthood there in November 1776.{{sfn|Griffin|1915|p=162}}{{sfn|Ennis|1976|p=86}} Conwell was well-educated, being fluent in Latin, French, Spanish, and Italian, but had a reputation as a preacher of only modest ability.{{sfn|Griffin|1915|p=166}} Around 1785, he contemplated moving to the United States but was concerned about the still uncertain financial state of the new country's parishes, and ultimately decided not to apply for a position there.{{sfn|Ennis|1976|p=86}} He was appointed [[parish priest]] of [[Dungannon]] in 1792 or 1793 and [[Vicar General]] of the [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Armagh|Archdiocese of Armagh]] in 1794.{{sfn|Luke|1940|pp=291\u2013292}}{{sfn|Loughlin|1908}} After the death of Archbishop [[Richard O'Reilly]] in 1818, Conwell served as acting Archbishop.{{sfn|Griffin|1915|p=163}}\n\n==Bishop of Philadelphia==\n===Ordination===\nMany of the clergy who served under him in Armagh recommended that the Pope appoint Conwell to head the diocese permanently.{{sfn|Griffin|1915|p=163}} Some opposed him, accusing him of being frequently absent from his parish to visit France and Scotland.{{sfn|MacAuley|1982|pp=342\u2013343}} The British government also objected, favoring [[Patrick Curtis]] instead, as they saw him as more friendly to their interests.{{sfn|Griffin|1915|p=163}} The Vatican agreed,{{Failed verification|date=April 2020}} and [[Pope Pius VII]] appointed Curtis to Armagh, offering Conwell instead a choice of the [[Episcopal see|sees]] of [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Philadelphia|Philadelphia]] or [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Madras and Mylapore|Madras]]; Conwell chose Philadelphia.{{sfn|Griffin|1915|p=163}} Now more than 70 years old, he was ordained bishop in London on September 24, 1819, by Bishop [[William Poynter]], the [[Vicar Apostolic of the London District]], assisted by Fathers [[James Bramston (bishop)|James Bramston]] and [[Joseph Francis Carpue]].{{efn|Although three bishops are typically required for ordination, the Pope may issue a dispensation when co-consecrators are unavailable.{{sfn|Code of Canon Law}} }}{{sfn|Bransom|1990|p=13}}\n\nThe see of Philadelphia had been vacant since the death of Bishop [[Michael Francis Egan]] in 1814, despite several efforts to fill it.{{sfn|Shea|1886|p=156}} Archbishop [[John Carroll (bishop)|John Carroll]] of Baltimore, whose [[Ecclesiastical province|province]] included Philadelphia, had considered no fewer than fifteen priests for the position; some had been ruled out for one reason or another, and others (including the apostolic administrator, [[Louis de Barth]]) had turned the job down.{{sfn|Ennis|1976|pp=80\u201381}} Part of the delay was logistical\u2014Carroll was unsure of the exact procedure for selecting a candidate in the recently erected province\u2014but part was due to the perceived undesirability of the post, which oversaw only a few small churches in a part of the nation with few Catholics.{{sfn|Ennis|1976|pp=80\u201381}} There was also a significant dispute (known as [[trusteeism]]) over the rights of churches' [[Laity|lay]] trustees that was likely to complicate the job of running the diocese. In Europe, the Church owned property and directly controlled its parishes through the clergy. In the United States, however, early Catholic churches were typically founded by laymen who purchased the property, and erected the church buildings. Those laypeople accordingly demanded some control over the administration of the parish, even after the arrival of clergy from Europe who held the traditional view of parish organization.{{sfn|Carey|1978|pp=357\u2013358}} In a larger sense, the dispute represented a difference in understandings of authority between Americans and Europeans.{{sfn|Hessinger|2011|p=368}}\n\n===Hogan schism===\n[[File:Old St. Mary's Church.jpg|thumb|[[St. Mary's Roman Catholic Church (Philadelphia)|St. Mary's Church]] in Philadelphia was the epicenter of the disputes that overshadowed Conwell's episcopate.]]\nConwell arrived in [[Philadelphia]] on December 2, 1820.{{sfn|Loughlin|1908}} The trusteeism dispute had only grown more bitter during the vacancy preceding his arrival. Shortly before Conwell reached the diocese, a priest, [[William Hogan (priest)|William Hogan]], approached de Barth (then administering the diocese until a bishop was appointed) about securing an assignment to preach in Philadelphia.{{sfn|Griffin|1913|pp=23\u201324}} After only a cursory investigation of his past, de Barth agreed, and Hogan was assigned to [[St. Mary's Roman Catholic Church (Philadelphia)|St. Mary's Church]].{{sfn|Ennis|1976|p=91}} Hogan quickly ingratiated himself with the laymen who made up the board of trustees, siding with them in their dispute with the other clergy.{{sfn|Ennis|1976|p=91}} Hogan's other behavior created tension between him and Conwell. When Conwell arrived, Hogan had already moved out of the priests' residence at [[Old St. Joseph's Church]] to a house across the street, claiming that the original accommodations were poor; his detractors said he used the private residence to entertain women. The situation became public when Hogan announced from the pulpit one Sunday that neither Conwell nor anyone else had the right to say where he should live.{{sfn|Ennis|1976|p=91}}\n\nLater that week, Conwell called a meeting of the city's priests and announced that Hogan was suspended.{{sfn|Ennis|1976|p=91}} The St. Mary's trustees took Hogan's side, while Conwell condemned the trustees as \"despicable ex-Catholics\" and \"the worst sort of [[Jacobin]]s\".{{sfn|Ennis|1976|p=92}} In the meantime, Conwell recalled a [[Dominican Order|Dominican friar]]\u2014William Vincent Harold, whom his predecessor had dismissed\u2014to assist him.{{sfn|Loughlin|1908}} The St. Mary's trustees had quarreled with Harold in the past, and his recall increased their mistrust of Conwell.{{sfn|Ennis|1976|p=93}} The schism continued as St. Mary's refused to recognize Conwell's authority over them or Hogan, explicitly excluding Conwell from their board and electing Hogan in his place.

When word of the compromise reached the [[Holy See]], the Vatican also objected, condemning Conwell's surrender of episcopal rights. Harold, writing to Rome, claimed that Conwell had had little to do with the compromise, which he blamed on Father [[Michael Hurley (19th-century priest)|Michael Hurley]] and Conwell's Protestant lawyer, Josiah Randall.{{efn|Josiah Randall would soon become the father of [[Samuel J.

It is also the only Catholic day and boarding college for boys in New Zealand's [[South Island]]. Students at St Bede's are colloquially known as Bedeans. St Bede's College was founded in 1911 by the [[Society of Mary (Marists)|Marists]], a [[religious congregation]] founded in [[Lyon]], France in 1816.\n\nThe current rector of the college, Mr Justin Boyle, was appointed in 2002. He was previously the first lay principal of [[St. Kevin's College, Oamaru]] but left at the end of 2001 to become the first lay rector of St Bede's.\n\n==St. Bede==\nThe college bears the name of [[The Venerable Bede]] (AD 673\u2013735) an English [[Benedictine]] Monk, Scholar, and Saint. Widely regarded as the Father of English History, Bede is most famous for his ''[[Historia ecclesiastica gentis Anglorum]]'', recognized as the first ecclesiastical history of Britain. During his time, Bede was regarded as the finest scholar in Europe. His shrine is at [[Jarrow]], [[England]].\n\n==Philosophy and Marist Tradition==\nThe college is renowned for its high academic standards, proud sporting heritage and the distinctive educational philosophy of the Marist tradition. From its beginnings, St. Bede's College has taught its students by observing a tradition that combines Marian and apostolic elements. For the most part of the previous century, the college had residential Marist priests and brothers as teaching staff. There is still a significant Marist presence at the college.\n\nThe college's mission is '''To help each boy develop fully by Faith and by Works'''.\n\n==History==\nThe [[Society of Mary (Marists)]] is a religious congregation founded in 1816 in [[Lyon]], [[France]] at the time of the [[French Revolution]] by  Father [[Jean-Claude Colin]] (1790\u20131875) and twelve colleagues, including [[Marcellin Champagnat|Marcellin Joseph Beno\u00eet Champagnat]], future Founder of the [[Marist Brothers]], and Father (later Bishop) [[Jean Baptiste Pompallier|Jean Baptiste Fran\u00e7ois Pompallier]], first bishop of the Roman Catholic Church in New Zealand.\n\nThe canonical approbation of the Society of Mary was given by [[Pope Gregory XVI]] in 1836. Fr Jean-Claude Colin had a close association with Pompallier who accompanied the French Marist Missionaries to New Zealand. The Society of Mary became involved in missionary work and teaching, work that was very similar to the missions of the [[Jesuits]], but which had a distinctive Marian approach.\n\nBefore 1877, education in New Zealand was a provincial jurisdiction, with many schools being established by churches or private funding. With the [[Education Act 1877]], the New Zealand Government centralised control through twelve regional education boards to introduce free, compulsory and secular education. Schools intending to teach religious instruction could not receive Government assistance. The Society of Mary continued to build the foundations for a Catholic System of Education, sourcing religious teachers from Ireland, Europe and Australia. In 1885, the Society of Mary established St. Patrick's College in Cambridge Terrace, Wellington. St. Patrick's College was the first Society of Mary secondary school for Boys in [[New Zealand]]. {{Citation needed|date=September 2009}}\n\nSt. Bede's College, Christchurch, was established in 1911 at the request of [[John Grimes (New Zealand bishop)|Bishop John Joseph Grimes S.M.]], and the first Catholic Bishop of Christchurch. The Society owned St. Bede's College. The school was originally located along Ferry Road, but it outgrew its facilities. The college had the option of purchasing the current site or that of [[St. Andrew's College (New Zealand)|St. Andrew's College, Christchurch]] in [[Merivale]]. Some say that the choice made was a fine decision because due to the land being cheaper, the college was able to build magnificent stone buildings to accommodate the monks and to accommodate lessons. The chapel was originally used as a gym, but with the building of Chanel Hall, it became obsolete and so was converted to a chapel. The chapel contains the Board of Honour, honouring Bedeans who fought and died for their country in both world wars. {{Citation needed|date=September 2009}}\n\nThe college was moved in 1920 to its present site on 220,000 square meters of fields and trees at the northern entrance to the city. The original buildings of St. Bede's were magnificent in old design, but  most of them had to be demolished in 1981 due to new earthquake safety requirements. However, the chapel and half of Durham remain standing. Over the years, buildings have continued to be added to the college, including the Alistair Macdonald Centre for the Performing Arts, Jarrow (a senior boarding dorm) as well as a new gymnasium. The chapel is described as the heart of the school. In addition to the surface buildings, the school has a number of tunnels and bomb shelters under the school, built for evacuation purposes. {{Citation needed|date=September 2009}}\n\nIn 2009, the [[Society of Mary (Marists)]] in [[New Zealand]] accepted a complaint that one of its priests, a former teacher at St Bede's College (in 1939), [[Francis Durning]], had sexually abused children.<ref name=\"no records\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.rnz.co.nz/news/national/375653/wellington-catholic-school-has-no-records-of-sex-abuse|title=Wellington Catholic school has no records of sex abuse|date=11 November 2018|website=RNZ|language=en-nz|access-date=23 January 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200128082612/https://www.rnz.co.nz/news/national/375653/wellington-catholic-school-has-no-records-of-sex-abuse|archive-date=28 January 2020|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n==The house system==\nA house system was instituted at St. Bede's College, with every student allocated to a house. The house system has several functions, including administrative. Each house is named for a distinguished person associated with the college and its name. There are five houses. These are:\n* '''Benedict''', gold house, named for St. Benedict, Founder of the Benedictine Order at Monte Cassino of which Bede was a member. Benedict has won the house points shield (Burger Shield) from 2003\u20132011. Renowned for the motto, \"pure gold\".\n* '''Colin''', light blue house, named for The Venerable Jean-Claude Colin, S.M. was a French priest, founder of the Society of Mary in Lyon, France.\n* '''McCarthy''', green house, named for Major, Rt. Hon. Sir Thaddeus McCarthy, Alumnus, Jurist and the college's first Knight.\n* '''Mannix''', dark blue house, named for Fr. John Mannix, SM, Seventh Rector of the college and first Old Boy to become Rector.\n* '''Redwood''', maroon house (often uses Red), named for Francis M. Redwood, SM, Archbishop of Wellington, who successfully sourced teaching [[religious institute]]s from France, Ireland, and Australia, after the passage of the Education Act, 1877. He also served on the Senate of the University of New Zealand for more than 25 years.\n\n==Boarding houses==\nThe boarding houses are for boarding pupils and are located on the college grounds. These are:\n* '''Grimes''', named for John Joseph Grimes, SM, the first Roman Catholic Bishop of Christchurch (1888). Bishop Grimes oversaw the completion of construction in 1905 of the [[Cathedral of the Blessed Sacrament, Christchurch|Cathedral of the Blessed Sacrament]], designed by [[Francis Petre]]. The Grimes building sustained damage in the Canterbury earthquake, and was therefore demolished.\n* '''Jarrow''', named for the English town of Jarrow, on the River Tyne, and the Monastery where St. Bede spent most of his life.\n* '''Durham''', named for Durham Cathedral, England, where the remains of St. Bede were entombed after being taken from Jarrow circa 1020.\n* '''Wearmouth''', The Wearmouth boarding wing for Year 13 boarders was opened during the first week in August 2010. This wonderful facility was designed by architect Duval O\u2019Neill and built by Matthew Bushnell.\n\n==Notable alumni==\n{{maincat|People educated at St Bede's College, Christchurch}}\nSt. Bede's College Old Boys are notably represented in the [[New Zealand Parliament]] in the [[New Zealand House of Representatives|House of Representatives]]. They accounted for the greatest number of alumni of any New Zealand College to sit in the Legislature of New Zealand's [[47th New Zealand Parliament|47th]], [[48th New Zealand Parliament|48th]], [[49th New Zealand Parliament|49th]], [[50th New Zealand Parliament|50th]] and [[51st New Zealand Parliament]]s.\n\nThe following old boys are members of the [[52nd New Zealand Parliament]];\n\n* [[Damien O'Connor]]  (born 1958), in Parliament since 1993 (with a gap of a few months) representing the Labour Party; Cabinet Minister (2005\u20132008); [[Minister of Agriculture (New Zealand)|Minister of Agriculture]] and several other portfolios (2017 \u2013 present)\n* [[Gerry Brownlee]] (born 1956), National Party MP since 1996.

St Bede's played St Pat's Town in rugby from the 1920s until the early 1970s when it was dropped due to financial reasons. This was for the Holley Shield and the series between the two colleges stood at St Bede's 24, St Pat's Town 20, with one draw. The game against Silverstream had not been played since the Second World War until it was revived in the 1990s. Today, all three Colleges are part of the legacy of the Society of Mary in New Zealand.\n\n==Effects from Canterbury quakes==\nAs a result of the severe [[2011 Canterbury earthquake]] on 22 February, the school was fortunately spared, although the school was shut until 14 March to undergo building inspections. Sister school Marian College in Shirley, Christchurch was not so fortunate, being severely damaged.<ref>[http://www.indiannewslink.co.nz/index.php/educationlink/right-policy-will-lift-education-standard-for-all.html Marian College damaged]</ref> Marian College is an all-girls school, and it was decided to share facilities with St. Bedes. The boys from St. Bedes attended school using a \"morning timetable\" up until 13:00, with the girls continuing on in the afternoon and evening.<ref>[http://www.stbedes.school.nz/2011/03/earthquake-updates/ St. Bedes to share with Marian College]</ref> The celebration of the 100th anniversary of St. Bedes College, due to take place at the end of May 2011, was also postponed as a result of the earthquake until a year later on May 2012. The Grimes boarding house was found unsafe due to quake damage resulting in the relocation of year ten and twelve students to the Durham boarding house. Grimes was demolished in early 2013 along with the Chapel of St Bede, previously the only original building on the site. The Chanel hall was demolished at the end of 2013. Currently, plans for a replacement hall are unknown, and the school is using the gym for Masses, liturgies and assemblies.\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n{{Schools in Canterbury}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Saint Bede's College, Christchurch}}\n[[Category:Secondary schools in Christchurch]]\n[[Category:Boys' schools in New Zealand]]\n[[Category:Boarding schools in New Zealand]]\n[[Category:Educational institutions established in 1911]]\n[[Category:Catholic secondary schools in Christchurch]]\n[[Category:1911 establishments in New Zealand]]\n[[Category:1910s architecture in New Zealand]]\n", "text_old": "{{Use dmy dates|date=October 2011}}\n{{more citations needed|date=January 2012}}\n{{Infobox school\n| name        = St Bede's College\n| seal_image  = \n| image       = St Bede's College, Christchurch 872.JPG\n| image_size  = 250px\n| caption     = Pedestrian and Cyclist entrance to the college on Main North Road\n| motto       = '''''Fide et Opere'''''<br>('''''By Faith and By Works''''')\n| coordinates = {{coord|43|29|S|172|37.1|E|type:edu_region:NZ-CAN|display=inline,title}}\n| type        = [[State-integrated school|State Integrated]] Single Sex Boys College (Year 9\u201313) with Boarding Facilities\n| established = 1911; {{years ago|1912}} years ago\n| MOE         = 315\n| rector      = [[Justin Boyle]]\n| area          = 22 hectares  \n| decile      = 9\n| address     = 210 Main North Road, Papanui, Christchurch, New Zealand\n| roll        = {{NZ school roll data|315|y||y}}\n| homepage    = [http://www.stbedes.school.nz/ stbedes.school.nz]\n}}\n\n'''St. Bede's College''' is a state integrated [[Roman Catholic]] [[day school|day]] and [[boarding school]] in [[Christchurch]], New Zealand, for boys aged 12 (Year 9) to 18 (Year 13).<ref>St Bede's College, 1911\u20131986, 75th Jubilee, Christchurch City Library Category #373.93831</ref> St. Bede's is the oldest Roman Catholic Boys' College in New Zealand's South Island. It is also the only Catholic day and boarding college for boys in New Zealand's [[South Island]]. Students at St Bede's are colloquially known as Bedeans. St Bede's College was founded in 1911 by the [[Society of Mary (Marists)|Marists]], a [[religious congregation]] founded in [[Lyon]], France in 1816.\n\nThe current rector of the college, Mr Justin Boyle, was appointed in 2002. He was previously the first lay principal of [[St. Kevin's College, Oamaru]] but left at the end of 2001 to become the first lay rector of St Bede's.\n\n==St. Bede==\nThe college bears the name of [[The Venerable Bede]] (AD 673\u2013735) an English [[Benedictine]] Monk, Scholar, and Saint. Widely regarded as the Father of English History, Bede is most famous for his ''[[Historia ecclesiastica gentis Anglorum]]'', recognized as the first ecclesiastical history of Britain. During his time, Bede was regarded as the finest scholar in Europe. His shrine is at [[Jarrow]], [[England]].\n\n==Philosophy and Marist Tradition==\nThe college is renowned for its high academic standards, proud sporting heritage and the distinctive educational philosophy of the Marist tradition. From its beginnings, St. Bede's College has taught its students by observing a tradition that combines Marian and apostolic elements. For the most part of the previous century, the college had residential Marist priests and brothers as teaching staff. There is still a significant Marist presence at the college.\n\nThe college's mission is '''To help each boy develop fully by Faith and by Works'''.\n\n==History==\nThe [[Society of Mary (Marists)]] is a religious congregation founded in 1816 in [[Lyon]], [[France]] at the time of the [[French Revolution]] by  Father [[Jean-Claude Colin]] (1790\u20131875) and twelve colleagues, including [[Marcellin Champagnat|Marcellin Joseph Beno\u00eet Champagnat]], future Founder of the [[Marist Brothers]], and Father (later Bishop) [[Jean Baptiste Pompallier|Jean Baptiste Fran\u00e7ois Pompallier]], first bishop of the Roman Catholic Church in New Zealand.\n\nThe canonical approbation of the Society of Mary was given by [[Pope Gregory XVI]] in 1836. Fr Jean-Claude Colin had a close association with Pompallier who accompanied the French Marist Missionaries to New Zealand. The Society of Mary became involved in missionary work and teaching, work that was very similar to the missions of the [[Jesuits]], but which had a distinctive Marian approach.\n\nBefore 1877, education in New Zealand was a provincial jurisdiction, with many schools being established by churches or private funding. With the [[Education Act 1877]], the New Zealand Government centralised control through twelve regional education boards to introduce free, compulsory and secular education. Schools intending to teach religious instruction could not receive Government assistance. The Society of Mary continued to build the foundations for a Catholic System of Education, sourcing religious teachers from Ireland, Europe and Australia. In 1885, the Society of Mary established St. Patrick's College in Cambridge Terrace, Wellington. St. Patrick's College was the first Society of Mary secondary school for Boys in [[New Zealand]]. {{Citation needed|date=September 2009}}\n\nSt. Bede's College, Christchurch, was established in 1911 at the request of [[John Grimes (New Zealand bishop)|Bishop John Joseph Grimes S.M.]], and the first Catholic Bishop of Christchurch. The Society owned St. Bede's College. The school was originally located along Ferry Road, but it outgrew its facilities. The college had the option of purchasing the current site or that of [[St. Andrew's College (New Zealand)|St. Andrew's College, Christchurch]] in [[Merivale]]. Some say that the choice made was a fine decision because due to the land being cheaper, the college was able to build magnificent stone buildings to accommodate the monks and to accommodate lessons. The chapel was originally used as a gym, but with the building of Chanel Hall, it became obsolete and so was converted to a chapel. The chapel contains the Board of Honour, honouring Bedeans who fought and died for their country in both world wars. {{Citation needed|date=September 2009}}\n\nThe college was moved in 1920 to its present site on 220,000 square meters of fields and trees at the northern entrance to the city. The original buildings of St. Bede's were magnificent in old design, but  most of them had to be demolished in 1981 due to new earthquake safety requirements. However, the chapel and half of Durham remain standing. Over the years, buildings have continued to be added to the college, including the Alistair Macdonald Centre for the Performing Arts, Jarrow (a senior boarding dorm) as well as a new gymnasium. The chapel is described as the heart of the school. In addition to the surface buildings, the school has a number of tunnels and bomb shelters under the school, built for evacuation purposes. {{Citation needed|date=September 2009}}\n\nIn 2009, the [[Society of Mary]] in [[New Zealand]] accepted a complaint that one of its priests, a former teacher at St Bede's College (in 1939), [[Francis Durning]], had sexually abused children.<ref name=\"no records\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.rnz.co.nz/news/national/375653/wellington-catholic-school-has-no-records-of-sex-abuse|title=Wellington Catholic school has no records of sex abuse|date=11 November 2018|website=RNZ|language=en-nz|access-date=23 January 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200128082612/https://www.rnz.co.nz/news/national/375653/wellington-catholic-school-has-no-records-of-sex-abuse|archive-date=28 January 2020|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n==The house system==\nA house system was instituted at St. Bede's College, with every student allocated to a house. The house system has several functions, including administrative. Each house is named for a distinguished person associated with the college and its name. There are five houses. These are:\n* '''Benedict''', gold house, named for St. Benedict, Founder of the Benedictine Order at Monte Cassino of which Bede was a member. Benedict has won the house points shield (Burger Shield) from 2003\u20132011. Renowned for the motto, \"pure gold\".\n* '''Colin''', light blue house, named for The Venerable Jean-Claude Colin, S.M. was a French priest, founder of the Society of Mary in Lyon, France.\n* '''McCarthy''', green house, named for Major, Rt. Hon. Sir Thaddeus McCarthy, Alumnus, Jurist and the college's first Knight.\n* '''Mannix''', dark blue house, named for Fr. John Mannix, SM, Seventh Rector of the college and first Old Boy to become Rector.\n* '''Redwood''', maroon house (often uses Red), named for Francis M. Redwood, SM, Archbishop of Wellington, who successfully sourced teaching [[religious institute]]s from France, Ireland, and Australia, after the passage of the Education Act, 1877. He also served on the Senate of the University of New Zealand for more than 25 years.\n\n==Boarding houses==\nThe boarding houses are for boarding pupils and are located on the college grounds. These are:\n* '''Grimes''', named for John Joseph Grimes, SM, the first Roman Catholic Bishop of Christchurch (1888). Bishop Grimes oversaw the completion of construction in 1905 of the [[Cathedral of the Blessed Sacrament, Christchurch|Cathedral of the Blessed Sacrament]], designed by [[Francis Petre]]. The Grimes building sustained damage in the Canterbury earthquake, and was therefore demolished.\n* '''Jarrow''', named for the English town of Jarrow, on the River Tyne, and the Monastery where St. Bede spent most of his life.\n* '''Durham''', named for Durham Cathedral, England, where the remains of St. Bede were entombed after being taken from Jarrow circa 1020.\n* '''Wearmouth''', The Wearmouth boarding wing for Year 13 boarders was opened during the first week in August 2010. This wonderful facility was designed by architect Duval O\u2019Neill and built by Matthew Bushnell.\n\n==Notable alumni==\n{{maincat|People educated at St Bede's College, Christchurch}}\nSt. Bede's College Old Boys are notably represented in the [[New Zealand Parliament]] in the [[New Zealand House of Representatives|House of Representatives]]. They accounted for the greatest number of alumni of any New Zealand College to sit in the Legislature of New Zealand's [[47th New Zealand Parliament|47th]], [[48th New Zealand Parliament|48th]], [[49th New Zealand Parliament|49th]], [[50th New Zealand Parliament|50th]] and [[51st New Zealand Parliament]]s.\n\nThe following old boys are members of the [[52nd New Zealand Parliament]];\n\n* [[Damien O'Connor]]  (born 1958), in Parliament since 1993 (with a gap of a few months) representing the Labour Party; Cabinet Minister (2005\u20132008); [[Minister of Agriculture (New Zealand)|Minister of Agriculture]] and several other portfolios (2017 \u2013 present)\n* [[Gerry Brownlee]] (born 1956), National Party MP since 1996.

St Bede's played St Pat's Town in rugby from the 1920s until the early 1970s when it was dropped due to financial reasons. This was for the Holley Shield and the series between the two colleges stood at St Bede's 24, St Pat's Town 20, with one draw. The game against Silverstream had not been played since the Second World War until it was revived in the 1990s. Today, all three Colleges are part of the legacy of the Society of Mary in New Zealand.\n\n==Effects from Canterbury quakes==\nAs a result of the severe [[2011 Canterbury earthquake]] on 22 February, the school was fortunately spared, although the school was shut until 14 March to undergo building inspections. Sister school Marian College in Shirley, Christchurch was not so fortunate, being severely damaged.<ref>[http://www.indiannewslink.co.nz/index.php/educationlink/right-policy-will-lift-education-standard-for-all.html Marian College damaged]</ref> Marian College is an all-girls school, and it was decided to share facilities with St. Bedes. The boys from St. Bedes attended school using a \"morning timetable\" up until 13:00, with the girls continuing on in the afternoon and evening.<ref>[http://www.stbedes.school.nz/2011/03/earthquake-updates/ St. Bedes to share with Marian College]</ref> The celebration of the 100th anniversary of St. Bedes College, due to take place at the end of May 2011, was also postponed as a result of the earthquake until a year later on May 2012. The Grimes boarding house was found unsafe due to quake damage resulting in the relocation of year ten and twelve students to the Durham boarding house. Grimes was demolished in early 2013 along with the Chapel of St Bede, previously the only original building on the site. The Chanel hall was demolished at the end of 2013.
